- Hello.
- [Woman] Long distance for Scott Campbell.
- This is Scott Campbell.
- One moment, please.
Scotty, this is Joe. Joe Schiller.
How you been?
Fine, Joe. Fine.
- How's Nancy?
- She's fine. She's in bed.
Oh.
I guess I got you up, huh?
I was gonna call you tomorrow, but I have to go out of town.
I'll get right to the point,
Scotty.
- Would you be free to do a job for me right away?
- Maybe. What kind of a job?
Well, it's, uh, sort of a survey, but it could lead to something.
You know the Rochester Castle up in the hills, off the coast highway?
- I've read about it. I've never actually seen it.
- Not many people have.
Anyway, my firm represents the Rochester estate.
The castle's been out on lease about 10 years.
The lease has run out.
They've got a white elephant on their hands.
They want an architect to go up there and make a survey... condition of structure, possibility of conversion or remodeling.
- Maybe demolition.
- When would they want me to start?
You and Nancy drive up tomorrow.
You should be able to get there by late afternoon.
There's a real estate office about two miles from the turnoff... run by a guy named Quimby.
Get the keys from him.
You'll be better off staying at the castle.
It's quite a ways to a motel.
I'll be out of town tomorrow, but Loy and I will drive up and join you on Saturday.
- Hey, that's right. You haven't met Loy, have you?
- No. No.
Well, good.
We'll have a celebration.
Thanks. I just had one.
Today's our anniversary.
Congratulations.
So, we, uh... we got a deal?
We got a deal, Joe.
And thanks.
Ah, what are friends for?
See you Saturday.
- Good night, Scott.
- Good night.
[Line Clicks]
[Handset Settles In Cradle]
You can come out now.
I answered it.
- Who was it?
- Joe Schiller.
Joe Schiller?
What's he doing here?
He's not here.
He's in Los Angeles.
Just called to wish you a happy anniversary.
I'll bet.
It's kind of funny, isn't it?
I mean, we haven't seen him since... since we got married.
Must be that fine legal mind of his.
But that's not why he really called.
He offered us a job.
What kind of a job?
It's an architectural survey of a place up the coast.
An old pile called the Rochester Castle.
- You mean the one that crazy heiress built?
- Uh-huh.
Actually, it's, um, more early
Hollywood Spanish than a castle.
But she was supposed to have built some dungeons down in the basement or something.
What do they expect to do with it?
That's what they want us to find out.
Joe asked us to drive up tomorrow.
Tomorrow? You mean, like in a couple of hours?
Pretty long drive.
We'll never make it.
Good night, Frank Lloyd Campbell.
Well, it doesn't look quite the same... but I'm sure this is the road that leads up to the place.
If I could just see the lake,
I'd know.
Even if it is, we don't have the keys to get in.
I don't want to be a spoilsport, but why don't we go back and find the real estate office.
We didn't pass it on the way up, so it must be north of here.
About two miles, Joe said.
Let's take a ride up this road and see if I'm right.
Oh, come on.
Where's your spirit of adventure?
It's not my spirit of adventure
I'm worried about.
It's your sense of direction.
Live dangerously, huh?
I'm pretty sure this is the place.
I think we'd better walk it.
You said the lease had just run out.
Doesn't look like anyone's lived around here for years.
All I know is whatJoe told me, honey.
Let's have a look.
There's a lake.
This has to be it.
How did you know there was a lake, Scott?
Have you been up here before?
No, but there were pictures in the paper when they put Priscilla Rochester away.
What had she done?
Never really came out, honey.
Family declared her incompetent and put away.
Then they cleaned up whatever was going on before anyone could check it.
They must be quite a family.
Onward and upward, Mr. Campbell.
[Scott] Now, why would anyone build
a thing like that in this godforsaken spot?
- Locked.
- Is that the only door in?
As far as I know.
Supposed to be an elevator in here that goes to the top.
And that's the only road in.
She built this thing like a fortress.
What's in there?
Can't see a thing.
Well, I guess we'd better go back... and find that real estate office.
[Clears Throat]
It's a funny thing... airline hostesses, department store buyers, secretaries... they look all pretty much the same when you come right down to it.
- What can I do for you folks?
- I'm Scott Campbell, and this is Mrs. Campbell.
Oh, of course, of course.
Mr. Schiller called about you. I'm Mr. Quimby.
Come on.
Sit down, won't you?
Now, I suppose you came by for the keys to the Rochester place?
Yes.
Well, I'm glad you got here during daylight...
'cause it gets spooky up there at night if you don't know the way.
- Mr. Schiller said that you might be staying up there.
- That's right.
Well, there's a store a little ways down the road.
You can get groceries there.
Gas and lights still on.
No phone though.
- You're welcome to use mine
if you have to make a call.
- Thanks very much.
You, uh, don't happen to be superstitious, do you, ma'am? l-I don't think so.
You count 'em.
Go ahead.
Count 'em.
Thirteen.
You see? You see?
Fifty doors in the place, and only 13 keys.
Of course, they'll open everything.
Uh, Mr. Quimby...
I understand someone was leasing the castle.
That's right... for the past nine years.
- The lease ran out last month.
- Who was it?
Well, an old screwball... an old fella named Arbuckle.
Captain Sam Arbuckle, he called himself.
I understand he made his money in tent shows.
He retired up there.
- Why'd he leave?
- Search me.
Haven't seen much of him lately.
Never did see much of him.
Last two months of the lease he paid in advance.
And then he just up and walked away from it.
Didn't even turn in his keys.
That's a duplicate set you got there.
- Didn't anyone ever try to find him?
- What for?
Captain wanted his privacy the same as old Priscilla.
Well, we'd better get going.
- Thanks for the keys.
- Glad to oblige.
Anything I can do for you, just let me know.
You don't have a picture of Priscilla Rochester, do you?
After what Scott told me,
I just wondered what she looked like.
If I had one, Mrs. Campbell,
I'd be happy to show it to you.
As far as I know, there are no pictures of Priscilla Rochester.
Let's see. The last time I saw her was about four years ago.
I thought they had put her away.
They did.
She got out a few times.
Those fancy rest homes are not exactly Alcatraz, you know.
- Yes. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Quimby.
- You're welcome.
Scott, you just moved it an hour ago.
Somebody put it back.
[Engine Off]
Let's take a look at the place first.
I'll bring the stuff up later.
This is gonna be a real guessing game.
[Sighs]
You don't have to be polite.
I'll follow you.
Uh-huh.
[Chuckles]
Well!
Come into my parlor.
Scotty, isn't this really something?
If you like early Dracula.
I wonder what's up here.
I don't know.
- Let's find the elevator.
- Don't you want to try the stairs?
Tomorrow, hon.
It's getting late.
Even our own elevator.
- Ours?
- Well, there's nobody else here. Come on.
Isn't that terrific?
Wouldn't children love it?
Well, I don't imagine there's ever been a child in this house.
Shall we have a look?
[Cat Meowing]
Do you hear what I hear?
- Sounds like we have company.
- [Meowing Continues]
[Meowing Continues]
Ohh.
The poor thing must be half starved.
He looks pretty well-fed to me.
Oh, Scotty!
Okay, bring it along.
There's some milk in the car.
[Whispers]
It's okay, kitty.
So many beautiful things from all over the world.
Yeah.
There's supposed to be a warehouse full of stuff they took out of here... somewhere in L. A... if it hasn't been sold off.
Hey, what time is it?
About dinnertime.
You hungry?
I'm just beginning to get interested... after last night.
Well, why don't you wait here... and I'll see if a key on here will unlock a bedroom we can use.
- Then we'll go down and get our things.
- Okay.
Don't be long now.
[Crash]
[Crash]
[Twig Snaps]
Scott?
Scotty?
Where are you?
Here I am, honey.
Come here.
Wanna show you something.
[Gasps]
What do you think of it?
It's like something out of Dickens.
Well, you ain't seen nothin' yet.
And how do you like this?
Oh!
I thought we could make it our headquarters while we we're here.
Office, home, dining room, bedroom, all in one.
- I can set my board up over here.
- It's very cozy.
We'd better get to bed before you fall asleep.
[Moans]
- You awake?
- Mm-hmm.
Up we go.
- I'm not asleep.
- Well, prove it.
Care for one more day-after-our-anniversary toast?
Mm-mmm.
I'm for bed.
If you drop that, the estate'll sue.
Scott, one of the statues fell on the patio while I was upstairs.
- Did it break?
- All over. It's a mess.
Don't worry about it.
We'll clean it up in the morning.
Now, um, which bed do you want?
- [Click]
- [Meows]
[Yowls]
[Moans]
[Sighs]
[Meows]
[Shuffling]
Scotty!
- What is it? What's the matter?
- The door... it moved.
You stay here.
The lights are out.
Scotty, don't go out there.
Can't see a thing.
Oh, it's, uh, probably just a fuse.
I'll throw another log on the fire.
That'll do us for tonight.
Scotty, I think we ought to lock the doors.
I'll get the keys.
- I'll do it as soon as I fix the fire.
- No, I'll get them.
Fine watchdog you are.
Scott.
The keys are gone.
Honey, they weren't in the kitchen.
I couldn't find 'em anywhere.
Well... we're gonna look like darned fools... but I think we'd better, uh, go see if old Quimby's got another set.
- He said the ones he gave us were the duplicates.
- But what else can we do?
You don't suppose the police would help.
Honey, I'm not about to go tell the police...
I think someone snuck in my bedroom and took a bunch of keys.
They have a lot of trouble with kids breaking into old places like this.
They said anything, they'd just say it was a bunch of teenagers.
Well, under the circumstances...
I don't imagine the Rochester family... would like the police prying around here anyway.
That you can say again.
They have their own police.
Literally.
Oh, well, I think we'll get you a sweater and go see Quimby.
Okay.
Honey, I can get it.
Do you need anything?
- No.
- Okay.
Scotty!
Where'd you find 'em?
On the floor, under the night table.
Do you suppose they could have been there all the time?
Scotty, you know they weren't.
You looked yourself.
Wouldn't be the first time I missed something right under my nose.
Well, I doubt you could miss a ring of keys like that.
Okay then.
While we were out on the patio... somebody or something walked in here and put 'em back.
Is that what you want me to say?
What's the matter?
Scotty, count them.
That's old man Quimby's line.
Count them!
Eleven?
There were 13 when Mr. Quimby gave them to me.
You saw me count.
Well, this is... this is probably just some sort of prank, honey, some joke.
But if there is any danger,
I don't want you to stay here.
- What about the survey?
- It'll keep. We can come back later.
What if we can't?
What if they get somebody else?
Well, then... we've lost the job, that's all.
I think we oughta stay, at least untilJoe gets here.
Oh, honey, we've waited too long for a chance like this.
The Rochesters are the most creative builders in California.
You could have a ball designing for them.
- We could have a ball.
- You said it. I didn't.
Should we get our tape and start measuring?
All right, but, uh,
I wanna try something first.
There are two keys missing out there.
Let's find out which two rooms someone doesn't want us to see.
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Sighs]
Looks like we found one of them.
Are you sure you tried all of the keys?
One place down here we haven't tried yet.
What now?
[Doorbell Rings]
Hello.
- You're Scott Campbell?
- Yes.
Where is Joe?
How do you do?
Uh, where's Joe?
Isn't he here?
Oh, you're Mrs. Schiller.
- I thought you and Joe were coming together.
- So did I.
- You haven't seen him then?
- No.
Oh, excuse me.
This is my wife Nancy.
How do you do again?
I'm Loy Schiller, Joe's wife.
How do you do? Would you like to take your things upstairs?
I don't know. lfJoe isn't here...
Oh, he'll be along.
He had to go out of town on business.
Yes, that's what he told me also.
Well...
Thank you.
Isn't this nice?
Just like being home. Almost.
Well, we like the fireplace, and it is big enough for Scotty's things.
Oh! I forgot.
You're the, um... architect, no?
- Yes.
- Am I keeping you from working? Sorry.
Oh, no need to be.
We've just come to do a little measuring.
- Haven't even started yet.
- You help him with this?
Well, let's just say
I hold one end of the tape.
- It must be nice working with your husband.
- You'll have to ask him that.
Oh, I don't have to.
Not you two.
Go do your measuring.
[Gasps]
Is this your cat?
No.
She comes with the house.
Perhaps I should find you another room, if you're staying.
I don't know if we're staying.
You'll have to askJoe.
- Well, we'll be close by if you need anything.
- Thank you.
[Sighs]
Sounds likeJoe needs a marriage counselor more than he needs an architect.
Well, all he's got here is an architect.
I'm keeping my nose out of it.
Where do you suppose he is?
I was wondering that myself.
Six feet, 11 inches.
Let's get this one.
- Well, hello down there.
- Hi.
- Oh, I borrowed a towel. I hope it's all right.
- Of course.
I decided to sunbathe while you're working.
If I'd known you were coming,
I'd have arranged for a swimming pool.
To tell you the truth,
I swim on the bottom.
- How do you say? Like a rock.
- [Laughs]
I don't imagine you get too many complaints.
Thank you.
Well, there's a chaise lounge right on the patio.
[Door Opens]
- Let's leave the foreign aid to Washington, hmm?
- [Door Closes]
[Door Closes]
- Can I fix you some lunch?
- Oh, thank you.
It's late.
I won't have lunch today.
So I won't be... how do you say it?
Like a barn door.
[Nancy]
I think I'll diet with you.
America is the only place where people worry about eating too much... instead of not enough.
Well, now that lunch is over...
we might as well get back to work.
Six feet, four and one half inches.
[Groans]
If I do much more bending, my knees are gonna give out.
Just one more measurement, and then we'll have the floor done.
[Loy]
Are you finished?
It's getting cold.
I think I'll change.
What are you doing with all those numbers?
Well, you see, before I can make my survey...
I have to make the floor plan of each level.
- Oh. You draw that on the board downstairs?
- Later on.
You haven't seen Joe yet?
- Mm-mmm.
- Ooh!
Somebody's going to catch it.
- Just think... you might have married him.
- [Door Closes]
Now, really, lover. I just wanted some people I know to think that.
Touché.
And on that note,
I think I'll fix us some drinks.
Oh.
- We never did finish the other measurement.
- Let's save the knees, shall we?
We didn't find that other room either.
There were two keys missing, remember?
Honey, by the time we finish this measuring, we'll find it. Don't worry.
- Now, are you ready for that drink?
- I guess so.
[Gasps]
[Exhales]
Oh, it's you!
- You made me jump.
- Hello, Nancy.
Well, Joe!
How are you?
Fine, Scotty.
Good to see you.
We've been waiting for you.
- How did you get in?
- Well, the downstairs door was open.
Look, uh, why don't you two go ahead and sit down. I was gonna get some drinks.
Good.
I could use a drink.
Where's Loy?
I, uh, saw her car outside.
Well, she went down to our room to change.
She's been waiting for you too.
Yes, I know. I was supposed to pick her up, but she'd already left.
Well, perhaps she misunderstood.
Was she, uh, all right?
I mean... how did she feel?
Well, she seemed very nice to me.
She's been sunbathing most of the afternoon.
Well, it's getting dark.
What do you say we turn on some lights?
- Oh, uh...
- What's the matter?
The lights went out last night.
Scotty was going to fix them.
Oh?
[Chuckles]
- Looks like he already did.
- Well, he couldn't have. I've been with him all day.
- Anniversary wine.
- [Joe] Oh, fine.
Scott, did you, uh, fix the lights?
Lights? No. Why?
Well, it must have been a power failure.
Well, let's sit down and have some wine in the country.
I got a couple of jugs in the car.
I'll get them later.
Must have been spooky around here last night without any lights.
There have been a lot of little spooky things around here, Joe.
I wanna talk to you about 'em.
Well, here's to crime.
Or to old acquaintance.
I'll drink to that.
How very nice.
Old school friends.
You, uh, want to explain where you've been?
- I told you I'd pick you up.
- You're so polite, Joe.
- Such a gentleman.
- I asked you a question.
You're very good at asking questions.
Always the little lawyer.
- Sit down, Loy.
- I will not sit down.
You tell me you go to Santa Barbara, so I call your room.
- Loy, I told you...
- I call your room, and who answers?
I tell you who answers.
A girl!
Some kind of a girl.
- Sit down. Let's talk this thing...
- I will not sit down.
Loy.
- I'm sorry.
- Joe, do you want me to go down and talk...
No, no. Thanks, Nancy.
She's like a Roman candle.
I'll do it later.
She's right, in a way.
There was a woman in the room.
An ex-girlfriend of one of our senior partners who'd like to be single again.
You see, our firm doesn't like divorce cases, so I was...
I was asked to handle it quietly.
Well, I don't see anything so wrong with that.
The last one was pretty messy.
I promised Loy
I wouldn't take any more.
You didn't have to do it, did you?
No.
But let's face it... that's one way junior partners eventually become senior partners.
Why don't you run down and talk to her?
Because that's just what she wants me to do.
[Whimpering]
[Screams]
[Screaming]
[Buzzing]
I'll get her.
If she'd gone, we'd have heard her car.
We're six stories high.
You can't hear anything up here.
Come along then.
Maybe it'll help.
It's locked. I must have snapped something when I came in.
If it's locked, how would Loy get out?
If she slammed it, it probably locked by itself.
Well, if I know her, she slammed it, all right.
Well, her car's still here.
She, uh, must be in the house somewhere.
If she found the door locked, she must have gone up the stairs.
- Where do they lead?
- Just up to the top floor.
Well, back where we started from.
Scott, I'm worried.
Loy's angry with me.
She's probably just trying to get even.
She does things like that.
No, no, Joe.
There's been something wrong ever since we got to this place.
Who put the barricade back up? Who took the keys? Why the locked room upstairs?
I say, let's get the police up here
and open that door.
Now, wait a minute, Scotty.
The Rochesters spent a fortune trying to keep the police out of here.
Do you realize what fools we'd look like if Loy should walk in and say, "Surprise"?
Mm-hmm.
What about the locked room?
What about it?
It's probably empty.
But if we call the police in, the whole thing will be reported.
I'd like to try explaining that one at the office Monday.
- Joe...
- Scotty, it's all right for you to play independent.
You probably got a dozen architectural jobs waiting if you blow this one.
But I'm committed.
Joe, you know I don't.
But there's something wrong around here... whether Loy is playing hide-and-seek with you or not.
Let's start with the old man...
Uh, Captain what's-his-name... Arbuckle.
- What do you know about him?
- Not very much.
Supposed to be a colorful old character.
Liked his privacy.
I don't understand why nobody's ever looked for him.
Why should they? He paid his rent, left the place in good order.
How do you know he left?
And what about the old lady, Priscilla Rochester?
Don't worry about her.
They've got her locked up.
But Mr. Quimby said she'd escaped before, and that she came here.
All right.
Now, what do you want me to do?
[Chuckles]
Look, Joe.
I know how you feel about publicity...
I don't want it any more than you do.
But if we can't call the police...
I think we oughta start investigating... the various possibilities ourselves.
For a starter,
I'd like to call the sanitarium... and see if our Priscilla Rochester is present and accounted for.
Well, I suppose the smart thing for us to do would be to leave.
Can't very well do that till we find Loy.
They wouldn't talk to you at the sanitarium.
Want me to do it?
- There's no phone here.
- I know, but I can run down and use Quimby's.
I wish you would, Joe.
Well, I guess the least I can do is try to keep peace in your family.
Oh, incidentally, Joe...
still a secret, what the old lady did
to make 'em put her away?
It's still a secret.
But there's no harm in telling you, I suppose.
She killed a man with a shotgun she kept to scare off trespassers.
- Who was it?
- I don't know.
Some man who wandered up here.
Some bum nobody ever heard of.
He never was identified because she, uh... she blasted his head off.
[Engine Starts]
Operator, would you get me the number of the Brady Sanitarium in DeJur?
Thank you.
Yes?
- [Operator: Faint]
Thank you.
Oh, uh, could you get the number for me?
If you would, please.
You think the old lady flew the coop again, eh?
[Rings]
Brady Sanitarium.
[Phone: Joe, Faint]
- Well, who are you?
- [Joe Continues, Faint]
I see.
Well, you don't have to worry.
I checked her myself less than an hour ago.
I wish you'd check her again.
It's quite important.
- [Nurse, Faint]
- I know that, but these aren't the customary conditions.
I don't want to send someone out there at this time of night.
All right, Mr. Schiller... if that's what you want.
I'll be right back.
She's gone to have a look.
I'd, uh, like to keep this between you and me.
If she's there, there's no need for anyone to know about this call.
I got you.
You don't have to worry about me.
Spying! I caught you spying!
[Screams]
Always spying!
[Screaming Continues]
What do you suppose she's doing?
Spying! Spying! Spying!
I'll get you!
You don't have a thing to worry about, Mr. Schiller.
Miss Rochester is in her room, in bed.
I see.
You're absolutely sure?
[Nurse, Faint]
Good night.
[Doorbell Rings]
Did you hear something?
- [Doorbell Rings]
- Oh, Joe must be back. Front door's locked.
Scotty, what are you going to tell him?
What can I tell him?
We've almost searched the whole house and haven't found her.
He seems to be taking it rather calmly so far.
Yeah.
Well, maybe he found out something. l... I'll wait here.
I'd rather you told him.
All right.
But you stay put.
Okay.
- Did you find Loy?
- No.
I checked with the sanitarium.
The old lady's in bed in her room.
What the devil could have happened to Loy?
She must be in the house somewhere.
Nancy and I have been looking ever since you left. There's no sign.
Let's get back.
I don't want to leave her alone.
[Screams]
Honey. What's the matter?
What happened to you?
[Trembling]
It looked like Loy.
- Did you see her?
- [Gasping]
Where did you see her?
Huh? Honey, tell me where you saw Loy.
[Stammering]
In... In the last room at the end of the hall.
Is this the door?
Are you sure that's the room?
There's nothing in there.
It's empty.
Honey.
Honey, are you sure you didn't make a mistake?
Nancy, how did you see Loy?
I mean, what was she doing? l-I don't know. l-I thought I did, but I just don't know.
It's all right.
All right.
Here, sit down.
Give her a few minutes, Joe, and then we'll find out what it's about.
- Oh, Scott, did you check all the rooms?
- Yeah.
- What about the one upstairs, the one that was locked?
- Not that one.
- Still can't get in.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, what do you say you and
I have a look before we call the cops?
I've already kicked in one door tonight.
One more won't hurt.
All right.
Honey, come here.
Come on.
Honey, I want you to lie down until we get back... and I want you to lock the door from the inside with this key.
- Leave the key in the lock. Okay?
- Okay.
We won't be more than a couple minutes.
[Lock Clicking]
Scott, what do you suppose...
I don't know, Joe.
Let's get it over with.
I wanna get her out of here.
- How's your shoulder?
- All set.
Scott.
My God.
Must be the old man...
Captain Arbuckle.
Murdered in bed.
There's nothing we can do, so let's go.
Scott. Scott.
Do you suppose Loy is...
The police'll find her, Joe.
Now, come on.
[Knocking]
Nancy, it's me, Scott.
Unlock the door.
Come on, honey.
We're gonna go to the police.
We just found the old captain upstairs.
He's dead.
You two go ahead.
I'm gonna keep looking for Loy.
All right.
We'll be right back.
I'd feel a lot better if you had a gun.
Lawyers don't carry guns.
Their clients do.
- The 13th key.
- What?
Honey, we have one more place to look.
GetJoe for me, huh?
- Oh, Scotty, I don't...
- Look, nothing's going to happen to me.
Now, please getJoe.
I think I know where Loy is.
Come on.
That's enough!
Leave him alone!
It's all right.
Go now.
Why, you're... you're all a...
You can say it, Mr. Campbell.
Freaks.
No. I was gonna say carnival people.
Captain Arbuckle owned a carnival.
A circus.
A small one, but it was a circus.
But you...
You mean, he hid you here... when he retired?
I was his housekeeper, cook.
We took the others in when they needed help.
But we never let anyone know because of his lease.
[Woman]
You can come down now.
- Oh, Scotty!
- What have you done with my wife?
We haven't done anything with your wife, Mr. Schiller.
That's why you're here.
He'll show you.
But you must be lying.
I saw her.
What you saw... was a combination of two old sideshow illusions... the Locked Room and the Headless Woman.
The captain has others stored down here... a mermaid, spider-girl.
It's all done with mirrors.
You've probably seen them dozens of times.
- What have you done to her?
- Just a sleeping pill.
She's very excitable.
Is that the way you killed Captain Arbuckle?
Mr. Schiller, the captain was the only friend we had.
We didn't kill him.
He died one night in his bed, peacefully.
As you can see,
it isn't easy for us.
The captain took us in many years ago... when the sideshows began to break up.
When he died, we just locked the door.
We didn't know what else to do.
Well, you, uh... you could have called a doctor.
You didn't explain to them.
We had nowhere to go.
We needed time to think, to plan.
When you came, we hoped to scare you away.
Where will you go?
Can we go?
The police will probably want to ask you a few questions.
What will they do to us?
Well, under the circumstances, I, uh...
I don't imagine anything.
Uh, as far as we're concerned...
you can go.
Come along.
It's time for us to leave.
Where will we go?
We'll have to find a carnival again.
It won't be so bad.
- The faces...
- Oh, come along. Come along.
We've all been looked at before.
Hello, Nicholas.
Hello, Rex, how are you?
Fine, fine.
Where is Simon?
Well, when did you last see him?
Three months ago.
Three months?
Well, do you think he's in trouble?
Wouldn't he have told me if he was?
Well, perhaps he told Richard or Marie.
No, they haven't seen him since Christmas.
Then something must be wrong.
Let's go to his club.
He isn't there anymore, Rex.
He bought a house, a large one.
What on Earth for?
Exactly.
Well, do you know where it is?
Mr. Simon Aron's house.
Mr. Aron?
Good Lord.
Nicholas.
Simon.
Rex.
Hello, Simon.
What a wonderful surprise.
We must apologize for breaking in on your party like this, Simon.
Oh, it isn't a party.
It's just a meeting of a little astronomical society I've joined.
Really?
Well, let me introduce you to the members.
Countess, may I introduce my friends?
The Duc de Richleau.
Madame.
Enchantee.
And Rex Van Ryn.
Countess d'Urfe.
Madame.
Monsieur.
Tanith, Mr. Mocata,
I'd like to introduce you to my friends.
The Duc de Richleau, Mr. Van Ryn.
Ms. Carlisle, Mr. Mocata.
It's always a pleasure to meet Simon's friends.
Mademoiselle.
Monsieur.
Mr. Van Ryn.
I believe we have met before.
Have we?
I don't remember.
So you've joined an astronomical society, have you, Simon?
We were pleased to welcome him to our circle.
Yes.
That explains why I haven't seen anything of you for these last few months and why you appear to have forgotten our reunion tonight.
Well, I was...
Would you excuse me for a moment, gentlemen?
There's something I must say to Simon.
You're friends of Simon's?
Yes, indeed, mademoiselle.
His father, Rex, and I were companions in the Escadrille Lafayette.
And when he died you vowed to keep an eye on Simon?
Yes.
Well, when did you join this group?
We were never told that...
I don't understand.
Surely we're not meant to be more than 13.
Oh, we're not members.
What?
We only stopped by to see Simon.
I've just come back from the continent.
You see, we have this...
Excuse me.
What's going on now?
We're going to be asked to leave, Rex.
You move among the guests and listen to what they have to say.
Rex, old friend.
I hate to say it, but I'm gonna have to throw you out.
The meeting's due to start very shortly.
It's better than new, but we must learn to control it.
Control?
Yes, yes, I see exactly what you mean.
An organization...
Do you think we shall have a good meeting tonight?
If the weather improves, we shall learn much.
It is his natal conjunction which should help immeasurably.
Two years ago in Berlin,
I experienced exactly similar conditions.
That is most interesting.
It is all a question of strong ties.
Mars, in conjunction with Saturn, of course.
Yes, sir, but you mustn't call him Abraham until deep pull is executed.
Now why is that?
Well, there's got to be an initiation ceremony first, then we can call him.
Oh.
This looks like a splendid wine, Simon.
And you always had excellent taste.
Nicholas, I feel dreadfully embarrassed.
I'd love to have you stay but, well, it's not an ordinary meeting, you see.
And, well, you and Rex not being members.
Oh, don't you worry about that, my dear chap.
It's perfectly all right.
We both understand perfectly, don't we, Rex?
Of course.
I feel terrible about missing our reunion tonight.
It's a special meeting.
We must get together very soon, perhaps tomorrow?
Oh, Simon, I see you've got an observatory here.
I'm very interested in astronomy, and I'd like to have a look through your telescope, if I may.
I'll only be five minutes.
What do you want to look at his blasted telescope for?
I don't.
Simon, those charts.
They're not astronomical, are they?
No, good Lord, no.
They're just for decoration.
Relics, Middle Ages nonsense, you know.
It's clever of you to extend the decorative scheme to the floor.
Yes.
Well, if you'd like to see the...
Sounds like mice.
You'll have to go now.
What in the name of?
You fool!
I'd rather see you dead than meddling with black magic.
Let go of me.
I didn't ask you to come here tonight.
Even my oldest friends have no right to butt in on my private affairs.
Will someone please say...
I'm sorry, Simon, but
I feel like a father who sees his child trying to pick live coals out of a fire.
Will someone kindly tell me what's going on?
Chickens in a basket, diagrams on a floor. do these mean something to you?
It means that Simon here is playing the most dangerous game known to mankind.
Oh, come on, Nicholas.
Rex is right, you're making too much of it.
Then you have no objection if we stay?
You aren't members of the circle.
Circle?
The society.
If we stay, there'd be more than 13, wouldn't there?
Look, Simon, I think you will admit that whilst Rex and I have been your closest friends for more than 10 years now, we have never at any time stressed our age or our greater experience.
Now tonight I'm gonna break that rule.
I'm considerably older than you are, Simon.
And although I've never spoken about it,
I've made a very deep study of these esoteric doctrines.
I beg of you as I've never begged anything in my life before, give up this desperately dangerous adventure and leave this house with us immediately.
I can't.
Then let us stay.
Impossible.
Put him down there, Rex.
Thank you, Max.
Can you wait outside?
Well, I wonder what he's gonna say.
Nothing.
I'm only bringing him round to put him to sleep again.
Makes about as much sense as anything else has tonight.
Tilt the lampshade towards me, Rex.
Look into the mirror, Simon.
Look into the mirror.
Keep looking and listen to me.
You have been hurt and your mind is troubled, but you are with your friends now.
And there is nothing more to worry about.
I'm going to send you to sleep, Simon.
Your eyes will close as soon as I touch them.
You will wake up at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, and your mind will be free from all pain and from all anxiety.
Open your eyes, Simon.
Stand up.
I'm going to place this symbol of protection around your neck.
Once it is there, you will not remove it.
Now you will go directly to my bedroom where you will lie down and you will fall into an immediate sleep.
Max, show Mr. Aron to my room.
Thank God that's over.
I might agree with you if I knew what you were talking about.
We can certainly make good use of these.
To our reunion, Rex.
No questions?
Hocus-pocus, mumbo-jumbo, black magic.
Rex, do you believe in evil?
As an idea.
Do you believe in the power of darkness?
As a superstition.
Now there you are wrong.
The power of darkness is more than just a superstition.
It is a living force which can be tapped at any given moment of the night.
I tell you these people are devil worshipers.
That's ridiculous.
These are facts, Rex, not superstition.
The final proof was in the hamper.
They were about to practice the age-old sacrifice to their infernal master, the slaughter of the black cockerel and the white hen.
Yes?
I thought I'd better bring this to you, Excellency.
My God.
He's all right now, sir.
Did you remove this, Max?
- Yes, sir.
- Why?
It was choking him to death, Excellency.
He rang for me, and when I got here his face was almost black, his tongue protruding.
I should have known.
I'm sorry, sir, if I've done something wrong.
No, that's all right, it's not your fault.
We can only hope that he's gone back to his house.
Shall I look upstairs while you try down here?
I think it's better if we stay together.
Rubbish.
Don't worry, I'll scream if
I so much as smell anything.
All right.
Well?
Not a sign, you?
He's not here.
Unless up there.
It's possible.
Is it getting colder up here, or is it my imagination?
No, it isn't your imagination.
At least we've saved your lives.
But no Simon.
No.
It might help us to locate him if we knew the real names of those people who were here tonight.
Real names?
Yes.
In order to become a follower of the so-called Left Hand Path, one has to be re-baptized in the cause and take the name of some past notable of the occult.
That girl, for instance, Ms. Carlisle.
I have seen her before.
You have, where?
Biarritz, at the casino.
She was with that old woman, you know, the cigar smoker.
Simon called her Tanith, didn't he?
So?
Tanith happens to be the name of the moon goddess of the Carthaginians.
You mean she's been re-baptized?
Probably.
Well, let's see what we can find and get out of here.
What is it?
Fantastic.
The Clavicule of Solomon.
Valuable?
Invaluable.
What's it made of, cork?
It's cold.
My God.
Don't look at the eyes, Rex.
Don't look at the eyes.
Don't pull away.
Try to hold back.
Run!
Oh, I take back everything I said.
I've never been so scared in all my life.
I'm sorry, Rex.
Sorry, for saving my life?
I should never have allowed you into that place.
Forget it, we're out.
That's all that matters.
Wasn't very pleasant, was it?
Pleasant?
What in God's name was that thing?
Some infernal spirit given entry into the world by Mocata's powers.
Obviously, Mocata is one of the great adepts.
Perhaps even an Ipsissimus.
A what?
An Ipsissimus, a master of the highest grade.
Simon is in his hands, and he's about to be baptized into the service of evil.
When does it take place?
Baptism must take place on a true Sabbat with at least one coven of 13 believers present.
After tonight, I can't believe that they would dare to hold another meeting, unless...
What is it, Nicholas?
Do you realize what today's date is, Rex?
April the 29th, why?
Mocata isn't going to miss the chance of giving Simon his devil's baptism at the grand Sabbat of the year.
What are you talking about?
Tomorrow night, the eve of May Day.
In 24 hours, Simon could be lost to us forever.
What can we do?
We find the girl.
Thank you, good bye.
It's all right, Rex.
I've found her.
Where?
She was in a London hotel, the London Plaza.
I never knew there were so many hotels in London.
It was the 28th one I tried.
You should have woken me.
Just as well you slept.
You need to be more alert today than any other day of your life.
Well, let's go then.
You'll have to go alone, Rex.
It's vital that I should go to the British Museum and examine certain occult volumes that are kept under constant lock and key.
Fortunately, the curator's a friend of mine.
Well, do you want me to bring Tanith back here?
No, I want you to keep her as far away from London as possible.
Well, what if I take her to Richard's house?
Yes, perfect.
I'll telephone to say you're on your way down.
I'll see you there about three.
It should give you plenty of time.
We'll be there.
Oh, may I borrow a car?
Yes, take any of them.
Thanks.
What is it you have to say to me?
I haven't much time.
There's so many things I must do before we leave.
We?
The Countess and I, we're traveling together.
To the Sabbat?
Of course.
Couldn't you have spoken to me there?
In front of Mr. Mocata?
I'm hoping that whatever you have to say to me has nothing to do with my loyalty to him.
It doesn't.
What is it, then?
Well, it's just, I just wanted to take you to lunch.
If you're free, that is.
Take me to lunch?
Does that sound such a bad idea?
Mr. Van Ryn, you know as well as I do that neither of us is free to give our lives to such things.
Why not let me be the judge of that?
I think you'd better drive me back.
Mr. Van Ryn?
Don't ever do that again.
What has this Mocata done to make you so afraid of him?
It's what he'll do.
Oh God, it's what he'll do.
Where are you taking me?
To see De Richleau.
Look, there's nothing to be afraid of.
You know better than that.
If I'm not at the Sabbat in time...
Is that so important to you?
My satanic baptism?
You mean, you haven't been re-baptized yet?
But your name, Tanith.
I was named that at birth.
Then you still have a chance.
Chance?
Look, De Richleau can help you.
Believe me, Tanith, he can.
I've known De Richleau for many years.
And if there's anyone you can put your trust in, it's him.
Tanith.
Look at me, Tanith, in the mirror.
Listen carefully to what I say.
You'll have nothing to worry about once we get down to Richard and Marie in the country.
In the country?
Yes, where we're going.
Haven't you been listening?
Yes, I've been listening.
Peggy, run and wash your hands, will you?
Oh, Mummy, must I?
Oh, Peggy, yes you must.
Uncle Rex will be here in a minute.
Won't he have to wash his hands?
Yes, I expect so.
Why can't I wait till Uncle
Rex comes, then go and wash?
Then I won't be late.
Off, and take that hat off.
It's to protect my head.
We're having a picnic luncheon, not a gymkhana.
If I fall over and split my head wide open...
It'll be my fault, and I'll be very sorry.
Now hurry yourself.
She'll go like a bird now.
Good.
This must be Rex and his mysterious woman.
There's a car coming.
Probably be Uncle Rex.
Uncle Rex!
Careful!
Uncle Rex!
Uncle Rex!
Hello, Peggy, Marie, Richard.
What's going on?
I must take your car.
Simon's life depends on it.
He didn't stay long, did he?
Do not be afraid.
I'm still with you.
He will never catch you.
Listen, Tanith, listen and obey.
Hello?
Rex.
What?
It's all started.
I couldn't phone you earlier,
I would have lost them.
Where are you?
Crossroads.
Yes, yes.
Yes, I've got that.
Now listen, you're not to do anything until I get there, do you understand?
You're not to do anything at all.
Right.
Three turns to the left and then one to the right.
The last bit has a very rough surface.
Well done, Rex.
Here, take these.
What are they?
The results of my morning's research at the British Museum.
Put one in each pocket of your jacket.
And may I ask what they are?
Salt and mercury, effective against the dark forces.
They will protect you and
Simon, if we can save him.
And you?
I have other protection.
There.
We must get them out of here.
Them?
Tanith too.
Tanith is her real name.
This is her baptism as well.
Very well, we'll do what we can.
My God.
The Goat of Mendes.
The Devil himself.
Let go.
You don't understand, Rex.
It's not just your life you're risking, it's your very soul.
Oh God, if only there was some light.
That's it.
That's it!
Wait, I'll drive.
You get on the running board.
Kneel and face your master.
When we get to the bottom, throw that straight in the face of that damned monstrosity.
Right.
God help us then.
Who so dwelleth under the defense of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty.
Come on, Simon.
Hell of a way to turn up on their doorstep after not having seen them since Christmas.
Good morning, Your Grace.
Good morning, Malin.
My niece and her husband, are they up yet?
Yes, sir, I imagine so.
Won't you come in?
Rex and Uncle Nicholas.
What's the matter?
You all look so ghastly.
I'll explain all that, but first rooms for Ms.
Carlisle and for Simon.
They're both very badly in need of sleep.
Yes, of course.
No, I mustn't, I mustn't.
You do as I say, my dear.
Everything's going to be all right.
Marie.
Yes, this way.
Simon.
I can wait, I want to hear what is said and to make my apologies to you all.
Very well.
Rex, you stay with Tanith.
And if anything happens, you call me immediately.
You look as if you could do with some sleep yourself.
He could.
He's been up all night.
I'll take a nap later, but now we must talk.
Bring us some coffee in, Malin.
Yes, sir.
There.
I'll go before it's night again.
Well, you stay as long as you like.
No, no, I'll go before it's night.
Well, you try and get some sleep now.
Oh, Rex, what's this all about?
Well, your uncle will explain.
I wouldn't know where to start.
Go to sleep.
I'll be here.
Promise me.
Promise.
I don't want to harm any of you.
No.
Why couldn't we have met some other way?
The way doesn't matter.
It does, it does.
Does your friend possess any powers at all to resist Mr. Mocata?
We got you out of that bedlam last night, didn't we?
You've got nothing to worry about, okay?
I have everything to worry about.
You're quite serious about all this?
Deadly serious.
It's all true, Richard.
All of it.
God knows I wish it wasn't.
None of us may eat today?
Some fruit, a biscuit or two, some water.
And no alcohol?
I'm sorry.
That is if we're to stay.
Well, of course you're staying.
But the danger.
You think we'd let you face it alone?
You mean you believe all this?
Well, I'm damned.
You will find a talk with
Rex most valuable, Richard.
His skepticism was fully the equal of yours.
Now he believes?
Ask him.
Uncle Nicholas, how can we help?
You're already helping, my dear.
Simon's resistance is practically nil because he's been under the influence of Mocata for so long.
The same thing applies to Ms. Carlisle.
Rex and I are at a very low ebb after last night.
Your coming fresh into the battle now is of paramount importance.
Now I've got to leave you all for a short while, but I'll be back before nightfall.
Richard, I want you to sit with Simon while he sleeps.
You are not to allow him to get up under any circumstances.
Once he gets his head down, I imagine...
Under any circumstances.
All right.
He is not to be left alone for an instant, you understand?
Not for an instant.
Good morning.
I would like to see Mrs. Eaton, please.
My card.
Will you please wait here, sir?
There's a gentleman to see you, madam, a Mr. Mocata.
Well, you better call Mister...
No, wait a minute, I'll see him in the library.
And Malin, if I ring, come at once.
You understand, immediately.
Yes, madam.
Will you come this way, sir?
Thank you.
Please forgive me, Mrs. Eaton, for calling without an introduction.
But I'm here on an errand of goodwill.
Goodwill?
I'm returning the property of a friend of yours, the Duc de Richleau.
His motorcar.
Oh, thank you.
May I introduce myself?
Mocata, perhaps you've heard my name?
I've certainly heard a great deal about you.
Ah, I thought that might be the case.
But whether the facts have been correctly represented to you is something else again.
May I?
Very well, but please be brief.
Of course.
I shan't intrude on you a moment longer than is necessary.
Well, now as you probably know,
Ms. Tanith and Simon are very close friends of mine.
Indeed?
Yes, I believe they're here now, is that correct?
Why, how did you know that, Mr. Mocata?
They only arrived a short while ago.
That is neither here nor there, you see.
The point is that there are certain matters, of which you are quite naturally unaware, which make it imperative that I should take them back to London immediately.
Well, I'm afraid that's quite impossible.
I feared you would take that attitude.
I know the Duc de Richleau has been filling your mind with all sorts of preposterous nonsense about me.
I know that what he said is true.
You realize that Tanith and Simon may be in considerable danger if they do not leave this house.
On the contrary, they will be safe nowhere else.
Mrs. Eaton, it's obvious that you distrust me.
And after what your friends have told you about me,
I'm not surprised in the least.
However, your obvious intelligence emboldens me to think that I will serve my purpose best by putting my cards on the table, as it were.
There is no more to be said.
Please, hear me out.
Dear lady,
I do not propose to discuss with you the rights and wrongs of practicing the magic art.
I will confine myself to saying that
I am a practitioner of some experience.
Monsieur de Richleau has, no doubt, led you to believe that I am thoroughly evil.
Such is not the case.
In magic, there is neither good nor evil.
It is merely a science, the science of causing change to occur by means of one's will.
The sinister reputation attaching to it is entirely groundless and is based on superstition rather than objective observation.
The power of the will is something people do not understand, attributing to it mysterious qualities which it does not possess, being merely the power of mind over matter or in the greater number of cases, the power of mind over mind.
As your mind now is succumbing to mine.
For as you look into my eyes and listen to my voice, your will is leaving you, slipping away, and you are now beneath my influence.
Although your eyes are open and you seem aware, you are, in fact, asleep, your faculties dormant, your ability to act and think subservient to my will.
My will.
Mrs. Eaton, my will is yours at this point.
You cannot function in the least, unless I say so, can you?
Answer me, Mrs. Eaton.
No.
Where is Simon?
Upstairs.
Alone?
My husband is watching him.
And Tanith?
Upstairs.
Alone?
No, Rex is with her.
Mummy, would you come and...
Get out of this house, do you hear me?
I want the girl and Simon.
Show him out.
I am leaving.
I shall not be back but something will.
Tonight, something will come for Simon and the girl.
Richard, what's happened?
Oh, nothing, apart from an attempt to strangle me.
What?
He just woke up, tried to choke me, then went back to sleep again as if nothing had happened.
Mocata, he was here.
Why didn't you tell me?
Well, Uncle Nicholas said that Simon must not be left alone for an instant.
Better see if Rex is all right.
Rex, Rex, wake up.
She's gone.
What are you trying to do?
What's the matter, Tanith?
Come on, we'll go back.
No, I'm not going back there.
Why not?
I almost killed you.
Mocata was there.
Mocata?
He came for me and Simon, but he didn't succeed.
He won't give up, can't you see?
I can't go back there or he'll make me do something terrible to you and your friends.
I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to hurt any of you.
All right, all right, we won't go back.
We'll find somewhere safe to stay until morning.
I saw you coming.
You look terribly tired.
Uncle Nicholas, Mocata's been here.
What?
He returned your car.
He didn't harm you?
No, no, no.
Simon, where's Simon?
Asleep.
You're sure?
Yes, Richard's watching him.
And what about the girl?
She's gone.
Gone?
Rex is with her.
He telephoned, but he wouldn't say where.
What a fool he is.
Doesn't he realize yet what we're up against?
She ran away when Mocata was here, and Rex went after her.
Then why on Earth didn't he bring her back here then?
He explained on the phone.
It's through Tanith that
Mocata makes his attacks.
She's his medium.
That's why she's gone.
She doesn't want to be close to us.
Then why is Rex with her?
To try and prevent Mocata from gaining control over her.
Pray God he can.
As long as it's light, it may be possible.
But once the darkness begins to fall...
It's nearly dark.
Where's Simon?
Saying good night to
Peggy in the nursery.
What do you want to do about supper?
Water, Richard, just water.
All right.
God bless you, my angel.
Good night, Mummy.
Good night.
I've cleared all the furniture out of the drawing room, Your
Grace, as you requested.
Thank you, Malin.
You're to stay with Ms. Peggy until I tell you otherwise, do you understand?
Now to work.
All right now.
He must be getting weaker.
He's been attacking you all afternoon.
No, he won't stop.
It's too important for him.
But why doesn't he come at me with a gun or something?
He never risks himself in any way.
I can believe that, but this isn't doing him any good.
What now?
Now we wait.
No.
Frankly, I think we're behaving like a pack of idiots.
It begins.
What, what begins?
Mocata is working on you because you are the weakest link.
From his point of view, Richard.
You are the skeptical one.
He is looking for an easy way to break the circle.
Come on, will you?
Is there anything I could say right now that you wouldn't interpret in your own suspicious way?
Richard.
Well, it's all superstition, black magic.
Hell, I'm going for a drink.
Richard.
You and I have been friends for many years, haven't we?
I don't follow you.
If I begged you, for the sake of that friendship, to do something for me, would you do it?
You know I would.
Very well.
Then will you stay with me in the circle tonight?
You are unafraid.
I am not.
That's a pretty low trick, appealing to friendship.
Will you stay?
What else can I do?
I wish we had some water.
We have.
What?
There.
Yes.
Where do you get your water from, a swamp?
What?
- Taste it.
- No, don't touch it.
All right, I'll get some fresh.
No, that's exactly what he wants you to do.
What is it?
I'm not certain, but...
What?
The lights.
What about the lights?
They seem to be dimmer.
No, they're not.
Yes.
I don't know what you're...
It's getting colder.
This is to be expected.
It's only the beginning.
On your feet, quickly!
Back to back, join hands.
Easy, darling, it's all over now.
Hey, what's going on in there?
Let me in.
Stay still.
No!
Oh, come on, let me in.
It's cold out here, let me in.
We must let him in.
Who?
Do you think that's Rex out there?
Let me in.
Let me in.
What's that?
Don't leave the circle!
There's a light in the hall.
Peggy!
No, Peggy!
- No, Marie, no!
Let me go!
Run!
- It's not Peggy.
- Peggy!
You're out of your mind.
Simon!
I tell you, it's not Peggy!
Peggy!
Let go of me!
She's upstairs, asleep.
Oh God, Peggy.
I won't, don't you hear me?
I won't!
Simon, no!
No, Simon, no.
Back to back, quickly.
Can't we do anything but just stand here?
Isn't there any way of fighting back?
Only one.
What?
The last two lines of the Sussamma Ritual.
For God's sake, then what are you waiting for?
I daren't use them until our very souls are in peril of destruction.
To do so would destroy us as effectively as it would stop Mocata.
It could alter time and space and...
What is it?
He has given up trying to get Simon.
He has sent the Angel of
Death himself to claim him.
And us?
If he once breaks into the circle.
If we once catch sight of his face.
For God's sake, Nicholas, say it!
I can't.
Richleau!
It's over?
Yes, Simon, it's all over.
She's dead.
I know, Rex.
The Angel of Death was summoned.
He cannot return empty-handed.
I'll go and see how Peggy is.
Miss Peggy, she is gone.
What?
What happened?
I was watching her when suddenly a kind of darkness came over me.
I couldn't see, I couldn't hear.
There was nothing I could do, I swear it.
I know, Malin, I know.
No.
Oh my God.
He's got her, hasn't he?
Simon!
Don't try to follow him, Richard.
Mocata will know he's coming.
To follow him would be suicide.
What are we to do then?
How are we going to find Mocata?
Before me, Raphael.
Behind me, Gabriel.
On my right hand, Michael.
On my left hand, Auriel.
In the name of these mighty spirits,
I conjure you, Tanith, wherever you may be.
Join us in this circle that you may speak with us.
With salt, I summon thee.
With hair, I summon thee.
With blood, I summon thee.
The sign of Osiris slain.
The sign of Osiris risen.
You have called me, I am here.
Are you in truth Tanith?
I am.
Do you acknowledge our Lord, Jesus Christ?
I do.
Did you come here of your own free will?
I came because you summoned me.
I came willingly.
There is one here whose grief at your passing is very great.
He has agreed that you will be summoned back only in the hope that you will help him to protect his friends from evil.
Will you help him?
I will because I love him.
Then tell us where Mocata is.
I do not know.
Try to find him.
I cannot see him clearly.
He covers himself with a cloak of darkness.
I see the child though, a little girl.
Where?
I cannot enter.
You must.
I cannot.
The winged serpent guards the way.
I cannot enter.
Where?
I cannot see.
You must see.
You must enter.
I command you to enter.
No, please.
He is in there, the dark one.
Please, don't make me enter.
You must enter.
No, no, please.
I command you to enter.
No!
Yes, now!
I cannot!
Stop it!
You fool, you damned fool!
She's all right.
You might have killed her.
A winged serpent guarding the way.
But where?
On the gates of that house.
Welcome back, my son.
All right, I'm back.
You can release the child now.
Yes, I have you back.
Now I don't have to release the child, do I?
What do you mean?
You have no use for her.
Ah, but I do, my son.
A most important use.
I have you back.
Now the only one I need is Tanith.
- You wouldn't...
- Dare?
Take your place.
Now that our coven of
13 has been restored, we can begin the ceremony.
Bring in the child.
Now whatever you see, whatever happens, stay close to me.
God knows what we will find in there.
Almighty and all powerful
Set, father of darkness, king of death, I pledge this knife to you.
Rex!
No, Richard, no!
Mocata!
Welcome to our circle.
What have you done to my baby?
She does not hear you.
She's in a state of deep hypnosis.
In the name of God, you dare not!
Scarcely in the name of God, Monsieur le Duc.
What's he going to do with her?
Uncle?
Take me instead, Mocata.
You, Monsieur le Duc?
Your soul in preference to that of an unstained child?
What's he talking about?
He isn't going to...
Yes, the transference of souls.
That of your child for that of Tanith.
No!
Now if our two remaining guests will permit, we may proceed.
Almighty and all powerful Set, father of darkness, king of death,
I pledge this knife to thee, to do thy work and be thy servant.
Those words you said before, say them again.
And the blood of this child shall be...
I cannot.
You must.
The end is known not even to us.
My baby's going to die if you don't.
You must speak those words again.
The bride of chaos.
The bride of chaos.
The rider upon the beast.
The rider upon the beast.
With this knife do I draw out the blood which is thy life.
Only they who love without desire shall have power granted them in their darkest hour.
Peggy, get up.
Repeat after me the words of the Sussamma Ritual.
It's over?
Yes, Simon, it's all over.
Peggy.
Wasn't...
Tanith.
Come in, my friends.
She's all right.
Tanith!
Time itself has been reversed for us.
Tanith's death, Peggy's abduction, the ride to Chilbury, the ritual in the cellar, all these things happened, but now they have not happened.
We are back.
We are all safe again.
And is Mocata also safe?
You will also remember,
Simon, what I said to you about the Angel of Death.
Once being summoned...
Cannot return empty-handed.
Exactly.
Tanith has been restored to us, but the age-old law demands a life for a life, a soul for a soul.
And there is only one man in all this world who can replace her life, her soul.
The man who invoked the Angel of Death.
Mocata is dead.
Thank God.
Yes, Simon.
He is the one we must thank.
You never did eat your lunch, did you?
I better get back to the office.
These extended lunch hours give my boss excess acid.
Why don't you call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off?
Friday anyway, and hot.
What do I do with my free afternoon?
Walk you to the airport?
Well, we could laze around here a while longer.
Checking-out time is 3:00 p.m.
Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time is up...
Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend an occasional night in a cheap hotel.
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
Oh, Sam, this is the last time.
- Yeah? For what?
- For this.
For meeting you in secret so we can be secretive.
You come down here on business trips, and we steal lunch hours.
I wish you wouldn't even come.
All right. What do we do instead?
Write each other lurid love letters?
Oh, I have to go, Sam.
- I can come down next week.
- No.
Not even just to see you?
Have lunch, in public?
Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.
But respectably.
In my house, with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three.
And after the steak, do we send sister to the movies, turn Mama's picture to the wall?
Sam!
All right.
Marion, whenever it's possible,
I want to see you.
And under any circumstances, even respectability.
You make respectability sound disrespectful.
Oh, no, I'm all for it.
It requires patience, temperance, a lot of sweating out.
Otherwise, though, it's just hard work.
But if I can see you and touch you, even as simply as this, I won't mind.
I'm tired of sweating for people who aren't there.
I sweat to pay off my father's debts, and he's in his grave.
I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
I pay, too.
They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
A couple of years and my debts will be paid off.
If she ever remarries, the alimony stops.
- I haven't even been married once yet.
- Yeah. But when you do, you'll swing.
Oh, Sam, let's get married.
Yeah. And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale?
We'll have lots of laughs.
I'll tell you what.
When I send my ex-wife her alimony, you can lick the stamps.
I'll lick the stamps.
Marion, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself somebody available?
I'm thinking of it.
How could you even think a thing like that?
- Don't miss your plane.
- Hey, we can leave together, can't we?
I'm late and you have to put your shoes on.
Is Mr Lowery back from lunch?
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property.
You know, the oil lease man.
That's why he's late. You got a headache?
It'll pass.
Headaches are like resolutions, you forget them as soon as they stop hurting.
Have you got some aspirin?
I've got something, not aspirin.
My mother's doctor gave them to me the day of my wedding.
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilisers.
Any calls?
Teddy called me.
My mother called to see if Teddy called.
Oh, your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
It's as hot as fresh milk.
Hey, you girls ought to get your boss to air condition you up.
He can afford it today.
Marion, will you get the copies of that deed ready for Mr Cassidy?
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow's the day, my sweet little girl.
Oh, not you. My daughter.
A baby.
And tomorrow she stands her sweet self up there and gets married away from me.
I want you to take a look at my baby.
Eighteen years old and she never had an unhappy day in any one of those years.
Come on, Tom.
My office is air conditioned.
Do you know what I do about unhappiness?
I buy it off.
Are... Are you unhappy?
Not inordinately.
I'm buying this house for my baby's wedding present.
$40,000 cash.
Now that's not buying happiness.
That's just buying off unhappiness.
I never carry more than I can afford to lose.
- Count them!
- I declare!
I don't. That's how I get to keep it.
Tom, a cash transaction of this size is most irregular.
So what? It's my private money.
Now it's yours.
Suppose we put it in the safe, and then Monday morning when you're feeling good...
Oh, speaking of feeling good, where's that bottle you said was in your desk?
You know, sometimes I can keep my mouth shut.
Lowery, I am dying of thirst-aroonie.
I don't even want it in the office over the weekend.
Put it in the safe deposit box in the bank, and we'll get him to give us a cheque on Monday instead.
Yes.
He was flirting with you.
I guess he must've noticed my wedding ring.
Come in.
The copies. Mr Lowery, if you don't mind,
I'd like to go right on home after the bank.
- I have a slight...
- You go right on home.
Because me and your boss are going out and get ourselves a little drinking done. Right?
- Of course. Do you feel ill?
- Just a headache.
What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas, the playground of the world.
I'm going to spend this weekend in bed.
Thank you.
Aren't you going to take the pills?
They'll knock that headache out.
Can't buy off unhappiness with pills.
I guess I'll go put this money in the bank and then go home and sleep it off.
Marion, what in the world...
What are you doing up here?
Of course I'm glad to see you.
I always am.
What is it, Marion?
Hold it there.
In quite a hurry.
Yes. I didn't intend to sleep so long.
I almost had an accident last night from sleepiness,
- so I decided to pull over.
- You slept here all night?
Yes. As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open.
There are plenty of motels in this area.
You should've...
I mean, just to be safe.
I didn't intend to sleep all night.
I just pulled over. Have I broken any laws?
- No, ma'am.
- Then I'm free to go?
Is anything wrong?
Of course not.
Am I acting as if there's something wrong?
- Frankly, yes.
- Please, I'd like to go.
- Well, is there?
- Is there what?
I've told you there's nothing wrong, except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time.
Now, just a moment.
Turn your motor off, please.
May I see your licence?
- Why?
- Please.
Be with you in a second!
- I'm in no mood for trouble.
- What?
There's an old saying. "The first customer of the day is always the most trouble."
But like I say,
I'm in no mood for it, so I'm gonna treat you so fair and square that you won't have one human reason...
Can I trade my car in and take another?
Do anything you have a mind to.
Being a woman, you will. That yours?
Yes, it's... There's nothing wrong with it.
- I just...
- Sick of the sight of it.
Why don't you have a look around here and see if there's something that strikes your eyes.
And meanwhile, I'll have my mechanic give yours the once-over.
- You want some coffee? I was just about...
- No, thank you.
I'm in a hurry and I just wanna make a change.
One thing people never ought to be when they're buying used cars and that's in a hurry.
But like I said, it's too nice a day to argue.
I'll shoot your car in the garage here.
That's the one I'd have picked for you myself.
- How much?
- Go ahead.
- Spin it around the block.
- It looks fine.
How much would it be with my car?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasing you?
Of course not. Please.
Well, it's the first time the customer ever high-pressured the salesman.
I figure roughly your car plus $700.
- You always got time to argue money, huh?
All right.
I take it you can prove that car is yours.
I mean, out-of-state licence and all.
You got your pink slip...
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies' room?
In the building.
Over there.
I think you better take it for a trial spin.
I don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
I'd really rather not.
Can't we just settle this and...
I might as well be perfectly honest with you, ma'am.
- It's not that I don't trust you, but...
- But what?
Is there anything so terribly wrong about making a decision and wanting to hurry?
- Do you think I've stolen my car?
- No, ma'am.
All right, let's go inside.
Hey!
Just put it in here, please.
Thank you.
Heck, Officer,
that was the first time
I ever saw the customer
high-pressure the salesman.
Somebody chasing her?
I better have a look at those papers, Charlie.
She look like a wrong one to you?
Acted like one.
The only funny thing, she paid me $700 in cash.
- Yes, Mr Lowery.
- Caroline, Marion still isn't in?
No, Mr Lowery, but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
And call her sister.
No one's answering at the house.
I called her sister, Mr Lowery, where she works,
the Music Makers Music Store, you know,
and she doesn't know where Marion is any more than we do.
You better run out to the house.
She may be, well, unable to answer the phone.
Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.
No, I haven't the faintest idea.
As I said, I last saw your sister when she left this office on Friday.
She said she didn't feel well and wanted to leave early, and I said she could.
That was the last I saw...
Oh, wait a minute.
I did see her some time later, driving...
I think you'd better come over here to my office, quick.
Caroline, get Mr Cassidy for me.
After all, Cassidy, I told you, all that cash!
I'm not taking the responsibility.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
A girl works for you for 10 years, you trust her.
All right, yes, you better come over.
Well, I ain't about to kiss off $40,000!
I'll get it back, and if any of it's missing,
I'll replace it with her fine, soft flesh!
- I'll track her, never you doubt it.
- Hold on, Cassidy.
I still can't believe...
It must be some kind of a mystery. I can't...
You checked with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her, no?
You still trusting? Hot creepers!
She sat there while I dumped it out!
Hardly even looked at it. Planning.
And even flirting with me!
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you in all this rain.
Go ahead in, please.
- Dirty night.
- You have a vacancy?
Oh, we have 12 vacancies.
Twelve cabins, 12 vacancies.
They... They moved away the highway.
Oh, I thought I'd gotten off the main road.
I knew you must have.
Nobody ever stops here any more unless they've done that.
But there's no sense dwelling on our losses.
We just keep on lighting the lights and following the formalities.
Your home address.
Oh, just the town will do.
Los Angeles.
Cabin One. It's closer in case you want anything.
Right next to the office.
I want sleep more than anything else, except maybe food.
Well, there's a big diner about 10 miles up the road, just outside of Fairvale.
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
Boy, it's stuffy in here.
Well, the mattress is soft and there's hangers in the closet and stationery with Bates Motel printed on it in case you wanna make your friends back home feel envious.
And the...
- Over there.
- The bathroom.
Yeah.
Well, if you want anything, just tap on the wall.
- I'll be in the office.
- Thank you, Mr Bates.
Norman Bates.
You're not really gonna go out again and drive up to the diner, are you?
No.
Well, then would you do me a favour?
Would you have dinner with me?
I was just about to myself.
You know, nothing special, just sandwiches and milk.
But I'd like it very much if you'd come up to the house.
I don't set a fancy table, but the kitchen's awful homey.
- I'd like to.
- All right.
You get yourself settled and take off your wet shoes, and I'll be back as soon as it's ready.
Okay.
With my... With my trusty umbrella.
No! I tell you no!
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper!
By candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap, erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
Mother, please.
And then what, after supper?
Music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.
"Mother, she's just a stranger."
As if men don't desire strangers. As if...
I refuse to speak of disgusting things, because they disgust me!
You understand, boy? Go on.
Go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food or my son!
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?
- Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
- Shut up! Shut up!
- I've caused you some trouble.
- No.
Mother... My mother...
What is the phrase?
She isn't quite herself today.
You shouldn't have bothered.
I really don't have that much of an appetite.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I wish you could apologise for other people.
Don't worry about it.
But as long as you've fixed a supper, we may as well eat it.
It might be nicer and warmer in the office.
Well, it stopped raining.
Eating in an office is just too officious.
- I have the parlour back here.
- All right.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
You're very kind.
It's all for you.
I'm not hungry. Go ahead.
You... You eat like a bird.
And you'd know, of course.
No, not really.
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird" is really a false... Falsity.
Because birds really eat a tremendous lot.
But I don't really know anything about birds.
My hobby is stuffing things.
You know, taxidermy.
And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because
I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed.
You know, foxes and chimps.
Some people even stuff dogs and cats, but, oh, I can't do that.
I think only birds look well stuffed because...
Well, because they're kind of passive to begin with.
It's a strange hobby. Curious.
- Uncommon, too.
- Oh, I imagine so.
And it's not as expensive as you'd think.
It's cheap, really.
You know, needles and thread, sawdust.
The chemicals are the only thing that cost anything.
A man should have a hobby.
Well, it's... It's more than a hobby.
A hobby's supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Is your time so empty?
No.
Well, I run the office and tend the cabins and grounds and do little errands for my mother.
The ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.
Do you go out with friends?
Well, a boy's best friend is his mother.
You've never had an empty moment in your entire life, have you?
- Only my share.
- Where are you going?
I didn't mean to pry.
I'm looking for a private island.
What are you running away from?
- Why do you ask that?
- I don't know.
People never run away from anything.
The rain didn't last long, did it?
You know what I think?
I think that we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever get out.
We scratch and claw, but only at the air, only at each other.
And for all of it, we never budge an inch.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
I was born in mine.
I don't mind it any more.
Oh, but you should.
You should mind it.
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.
You know, if anyone ever talked to me the way I heard, the way she spoke to you...
Sometimes when she talks to me like that,
I feel I'd like to go up there and curse her and leave her forever.
Or at least defy her.
But I know I can't.
She's ill.
She sounded strong.
No, I mean ill.
She had to raise me all by herself, after my father died.
I was only five and it must've been quite a strain for her.
I mean, she didn't have to go to work or anything like that.
He left her a little money.
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.
And he talked her into building this motel.
He could have talked her into anything.
And when he died, too, it was just too great a shock for her.
And the way he died...
I guess it's nothing to talk about while you're eating.
Anyway, it was just too great a loss for her.
She had nothing left.
Except you.
Well, a son is a poor substitute for a lover.
Why don't you go away?
To a private island, like you?
No, not like me.
I couldn't do that.
Who'd look after her?
She'd be alone up there.
Her fire would go out.
It'd be cold and damp like a grave.
If you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them.
You understand, I don't hate her.
I hate what she's become.
I hate the illness.
Wouldn't it be better if you put her someplace...
You mean an institution? A madhouse?
People always call a madhouse
"someplace," don't they?
Put her in someplace.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to sound uncaring.
What do you know about caring?
Have you ever seen the inside of one of those places?
The laughing and the tears and the cruel eyes studying you.
My mother there?
But she's harmless.
She's as harmless as one of those stuffed birds.
I am sorry.
I only felt... It seems she's hurting you.
- I meant well.
- People always mean well.
They cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest, oh, so very delicately.
Of course, I've suggested it myself.
But I hate to even think about it.
She needs me.
It's not as if she were a maniac, a raving thing.
She just goes a little mad sometimes.
We all go a little mad sometimes.
Haven't you?
Yes.
Sometimes just one time can be enough.
Thank you.
Thank you, Norman.
Norman.
Oh, you're not going back to your room already?
I'm very tired.
And I have a long drive tomorrow, all the way back to Phoenix.
Really?
I stepped into a private trap back there and I'd like to go back and try to pull myself out of it before it's too late for me, too.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to stay just a little while longer?
Just for talk?
Oh, I'd like to, but...
All right.
Well, I'll see you in the morning.
I'll bring you some breakfast, all right?
- What time?
- Very early. Dawn.
All right, Miss...
- Crane.
- Crane. That's it.
Good night.
No!
No!
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!
Blood! Blood!
I've tried many brands.
So far, of those I've used,
I haven't had much luck with any of them.
Let's see what they say about this one.
They tell you what its ingredients are and how it's guaranteed to exterminate every insect in the world, but they do not tell you whether or not it's painless.
And I say, insect or man, death should always be painless.
I suppose, this one seems to claim more and better qualities than lots of the others.
Sam?
Sam! Lady wants to see you.
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.
- Oh, sure. Lila.
- Is Marion here?
- Well, of course not.
- Thank you.
Something wrong?
She left home on Friday.
I was in Tucson over the weekend and I haven't heard from her since.
Not even a phone call.
Look, if you two are in this thing together,
I don't care, it's none of my business, but I want to talk to Marion and I want her to tell me it's none of my business and then I'll go...
Bob, run out and get yourself some lunch, will you?
- That's okay, Sam. I brought it with me.
- Run out and eat it.
Now, what thing could we be in together?
Sorry about the tears.
Well, is Marion in trouble?
What is it?
Let's all talk about Marion, shall we?
Who are you, friend?
My name is Arbogast, friend.
I'm a private investigator.
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.
Why, I know you don't, because if you did,
I wouldn't be able to follow you.
What's your interest in this?
Well, $40,000.
- That's right.
Well, one of you'd better tell me what's going on, and tell me fast.
- I can take just so much of this...
- Now, take it easy, friend.
Take it easy.
It's just that your girlfriend stole $40,000.
What are you talking about?
What is this?
She was supposed to bank it on Friday for her boss and she didn't.
- And no one has seen her since.
- Someone has seen her.
Someone always sees a girl with $40,000.
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back.
- Sam, if she's here...
- She isn't. She isn't.
Miss Crane, can I ask you a question?
Did you come up here on just a hunch and nothing more?
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.
I don't care if you believe me or not.
All I want to do is see Marion before she gets in this too deeply.
Did you check in Phoenix? Hospitals?
Maybe she had an accident, or a holdup.
No, she was seen leaving town in her own car, by her employer, I might add.
I can't believe it. Can you?
Well, you know, we're always quickest to doubt people who have a reputation for being honest.
I think she's here, Miss Crane.
Where there's a boyfriend...
Well, she's not back there with the nuts and bolts, but she's here, in this town somewhere.
I'll find her. I'll be seeing you.
- Evening.
- Evening.
I almost drove right past.
I'm always forgetting to turn the sign on, but we do have a vacancy.
Twelve, in fact.
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies. Candy?
No, thanks.
Last two days, I've been to so many motels my eyes are bleary with neon, but, you know, this is the first place that looks like it's hiding from the world.
Well, I'll tell you the truth.
I didn't really forget to turn the sign on.
Just doesn't seem like any use any more, you know.
See, that used to be the main highway right there.
Well, wanna come in and register?
No, no, sit down.
I don't wanna trouble you.
- I just wanna ask a few questions.
- No, that's no trouble. Today's linen day.
I always change the beds here once a week whether they've been used or not.
Hate the smell of dampness, don't you?
It's such a...
I don't know, creepy smell. Come on.
You out to buy a motel?
No.
Reason I ask, you said you'd seen so many in the past couple of days,
I thought maybe you...
What... What was it you wanted to ask?
Well, you see,
I'm looking for a missing person.
My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.
I've been trying to trace a girl that's been missing for, oh, about a week now from Phoenix.
It's a private matter.
The family wants to forgive her.
She's not in any trouble.
I didn't think the police went looking for people who aren't in trouble.
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah.
We have reason to believe that she came along this way.
May have stopped in the area.
Did she stop here?
Well, no one's stopped here for a couple of weeks.
Would you mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Commit myself?
- You sure talk like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.
- Sure?
- Yeah.
Well, she may have used an alias.
Marion Crane's her real name, but she could've registered under a different one.
Well, I tell you, I don't even much bother with guests registering any more.
You know, one by one, you drop the formalities.
I shouldn't even bother changing the sheets, but old habits die hard.
Which reminds me...
- What's that?
- It's the light. The sign.
We had a couple last week, said if the thing hadn't been on, they would've thought this was an old, deserted...
Well, you see, that's exactly my point.
You said that nobody'd been here for a couple weeks, and there's a couple came by and didn't know that you were open.
Yeah.
Well, as you say, old habits die hard.
It's possible, this girl could've registered under another name.
Do you mind if I look at your book?
- No.
- Thank you.
All right.
I'll get the date somewhere.
See, there's nobody.
Let's see now, I have a sample of her handwriting here.
Oh, yes.
Here we are.
Marie Samuels. That's an interesting alias.
- Is that her?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
Marie, Marion.
Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam.
Was she in disguise, by any chance?
- Wanna check the picture again?
- Look, I wasn't lying to you, Mr...
Oh, I know that.
I know you wouldn't lie.
You know, it's tough keeping track of the time around here.
Oh, I know, I know.
Oh, yeah.
Well, it was raining and her hair was all wet.
I tell you, it's not really a very good picture of her either.
No, I guess not.
Tell me all about her.
Well, she arrived rather late one night, and she went straight to sleep and left early the next morning.
- How early?
- Oh, very early.
Which morning was that?
The...
- The next morning. Sunday.
- I see.
- Did anyone meet her here?
- No.
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- No.
- Did she make any phone calls or...
- No.
Locally?
Did you spend the night with her?
No.
Well then, how would you know that she didn't make any phone calls?
Well, she was very tired and...
See, now I'm starting to remember.
I'm making a mental picture of it in my mind.
You know, if you make a mental picturisation of something...
That's right. That's right.
Take your time.
She was... She was sitting back there...
No, no, she was standing back there with a sandwich in her hand and she said she had to go to sleep early because she had a long drive ahead of her.
- Back where?
- Back where she came from.
No, you said before that she was sitting back there... Standing back there...
Yes, back in my parlour there.
She was very hungry and I made her a sandwich and then she said that she was tired and she had to go right to bed.
I see. How did she pay you?
- Cash? Cheque?
- Cash.
Cash, huh?
- And after she left, she didn't come back?
- Well, why should she?
Yeah.
Well, Mr Arbogast, I guess that's about it.
I've got some work to do, if you don't mind.
Well, to tell you the truth, I do mind.
You see, if it doesn't jell, it isn't aspic, and this ain't jelling.
It's not coming together.
Something's missing.
Well, I don't know what you could expect me to know.
People just come and go, you know.
- That's right. She isn't still here, is she?
- No.
If I wanted to check the cabins, all 12 of them,
I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?
Listen, if you don't believe me, come on with me.
You can help me change beds.
- Okay?
- No, thanks.
Change your mind?
You know, I... I think I must have one of those faces you just can't help believing.
- Is anyone at home?
- No.
Oh? There's somebody sitting up in the window.
- No, no, there isn't.
- Sure, go ahead. Take a look.
Oh, that must be my mother.
She's an invalid.
It's practically like living alone.
Oh, I see.
Now, if this girl, Marion Crane, were here, you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?
- No.
- Not even if she paid you well?
No.
Let's just say, just for the sake of argument, that she wanted you to gallantly protect her.
You'd know that you were being used.
You wouldn't be made a fool of, would you?
- But I'm not a fool.
- Well, I...
And I'm not capable of being fooled, not even by a woman.
- Well, this is not a slur on your manhood.
- Let's put it this way.
She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother.
Well, then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?
No. As I told you, she's confined.
Yes, but just for a few minutes.
That's all.
There might be some hint that you missed out on.
You know, sick old women are usually pretty sharp.
- Mr Arbogast... I think I've...
- Just for a moment. I wouldn't disturb her.
- I think I've talked to you all I want to.
- Yes, but just for...
I think it'd be much better if you left now. Thanks.
Well, all right.
You sure would save me a lot of leg work if you'd let me talk to her.
- Would I need a warrant for that, too?
- Sure.
All right. Thanks anyway.
Hello, Loomis. This is Arbogast.
Is Lila there?
Okay. Let me talk to her, please.
Hello, Lila.
Lila, listen. Marion was up here.
Yes, she spent last Saturday night at the Bates Motel.
It's right out here on the old highway.
I even know what cabin she was in.
It was number one.
Well, this young fella that runs the place said that she just spent the night, left the next day and that was it.
No, not exactly.
Well, I did question him, believe me, but I think I got all there was to get.
I'll just have to pick up the pieces from here.
Well, I tell you,
I don't feel entirely satisfied...
See, this boy had a sick old mother.
I think she saw Marion and talked to her.
No. No, unfortunately, he wouldn't let me see her.
Well, I was, but I think
I'll go back to the motel first.
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.
All right, fine. Listen, I...
You'll be happy to know what I think.
I think our friend Sam Loomis didn't know that Marion was here.
Yeah. All right.
See you in about an hour or less.
All right, bye-bye.
Bates?
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound.
Ever notice that, Lila?
Sam, he said an hour or less.
Yeah.
- It's been three.
- Well, are we just going to sit here and wait?
He'll be back.
Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
- How far is the old highway?
- You wanna go out there, don't you?
- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady...
- Yes.
- Maybe shake her up.
- Yes!
- That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
- Patience doesn't run in my family, Sam.
- I'm going out there.
- Look, Arbogast said...
An hour, or less.
- Well, I'm going.
- You'll never find it.
- Stay here.
- Why can't I go with you?
I don't know. One of us has to be here, in case he's on the way.
What am I supposed to do, just sit here and wait?
Yeah. Stay here.
Arbogast?
Arbogast!
Arbogast!
- He didn't come back here?
- Sam!
No Arbogast, no Bates.
Only the old lady at home.
Sick old lady unable to answer the door, or unwilling.
Where could he have gone?
Maybe he got some definite lead.
Maybe he went right on.
- Without calling me?
- In a hurry.
Sam, he called when he had nothing.
Nothing but a dissatisfied feeling.
Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything at all?
Yes, I think he would've.
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?
- Our deputy sheriff around here.
- All right. Let me get my coat.
Good evening.
Well, I don't know where to start, except at the beginning.
Yes.
- This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.
- How do you do?
She's been here searching for her sister.
There's this private detective helping and...
Well, we got a call from this detective saying that he'd traced her to that motel out on the old highway.
That must be the Bates Motel.
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs Bates.
Norman took a wife?
No, I don't think so.
An old woman. His mother.
Well, anyway, that was early this evening.
We haven't seen or heard from him since.
Now, your sister's missing how long?
Well, she left Phoenix a week ago yesterday, without a trace.
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
They thought she'd be coming to me.
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Yes.
She's not missing so much as she's run away.
- That's right.
- From what?
- She stole some money.
- A lot?
And the police haven't been able to...
Everyone concerned thought if they could get her to give the money back, they could avoid involving her with the police.
That explains the private detective.
He traced her to the Bates place.
What exactly did he say when he called you?
Well, he said that Marion was there for one night and then she left.
With the $40,000?
Well, he didn't say anything about the money.
It isn't important what he said on the phone, is it?
He was supposed to come back here and talk to us after he talked to the mother, and he didn't.
That's what I want you to do something about.
Like what?
I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.
It's just that I'm sure there's something wrong out there and I have to know what.
Well, I think there's something wrong too, miss, but not the same thing.
I think what's wrong is your private detective.
I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going, probably from Norman Bates, and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied and he was going back there.
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened?
At this hour?
Well, he was out when I was there just a while ago.
If he's back, he probably isn't even in bed yet.
He wasn't out when you were there, he just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night, like some people do.
This fellow lives like a hermit.
You must remember that bad business out there about 10 years ago.
Please. Call.
Florrie, the Sheriff wants you to connect him with the Bates Motel.
Hello, Norman? Sheriff Chambers.
I've been just fine, thanks.
Listen, we got worries here.
Yeah, have you had a fella stop by there tonight...
Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway.
- He's a private detective, name of...
- Arbogast.
Arbogast.
And after he left?
No, that's okay, Norman.
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl, the detective thanked him and he went away.
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?
Your detective told you he couldn't come right back because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?
Yes.
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Green Lawn Cemetery for the past 10 years.
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
It ain't only local history, Sam.
It's the only case of murder and suicide on Fairvale ledgers.
Mrs Bates poisoned this guy she was involved with when she found out he was married.
Then took a helping of the same stuff herself.
Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
Norman found them dead together.
In bed.
You mean that old woman I saw sitting in the window out there wasn't Bates' mother?
Now, wait a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?
Yes! In the house behind the motel!
I called and pounded but she just ignored me!
You want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother?
But it had to be because Arbogast said so, too!
And the young man wouldn't let him see her because she was too ill.
Well, if the woman up there is Mrs Bates, who's that woman buried out in Green Lawn Cemetery?
Now, Mother, I'm gonna bring something up...
I am sorry, boy, but you do manage to look ludicrous when you give me orders.
Please, Mother.
No! I will not hide in the fruit cellar.
You think I'm fruity, huh?
I'm staying right here.
This is my room and no one will drag me out of it, least of all my big, bold son.
They'll come now, Mother.
He came after the girl, and now someone will come after him.
Mother, please, it's just for a few days.
Just for a few days so they won't find you.
Just for a few days?
In that dark, dank fruit cellar? No!
You hid me there once, boy, and you won't do it again, not ever again!
Now get out!
- I told you to get out, boy.
- I'll carry you, Mother.
Norman, what do you think you're doing?
Don't you touch me! Don't! Norman!
Put me down! Put me down!
I can walk on my own.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
We thought if you didn't mind, we'd drive out to that motel with you.
- He's already been.
- Went out before service.
- Did you two have breakfast?
- You didn't find anything?
Nothing. Let's clear the way here.
Well, what did he say about my sister?
Just what he told your detective, she used a fake name.
Saw the register myself.
Saw the whole place, as a matter of fact.
That boy's alone there.
- No mother?
- You must have seen an illusion, Sam.
I know you're not the seeing-illusions type, but no woman was there and I don't believe in ghosts,
- so there it is.
- I still feel that there's something...
Can see you do.
I'm sorry I couldn't make you feel better.
You want to come around to my office this afternoon and report a missing person and a theft, that's what you want to do.
The sooner you drop this in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you stand a chance of your sister being picked up.
How about that?
- I don't know.
- It's Sunday.
Come on over to the house and do your reporting around dinnertime.
It'll make it nicer.
- You too, Sam.
- Thank you.
- Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
- No, you're not.
Well, you want me to drop you at the hotel or...
Sam.
I still won't feel satisfied until I go out there.
Neither will I. Come on.
We better decide what we're gonna say or do when we walk in there.
We're going to register as man and wife.
We're going to get shown to a cabin, and then we're going to search every inch of the place, inside and out.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting.
Someone's at that window.
I just saw the curtain move.
Come on.
- Well?
- Just coming up to ring for you.
Suppose you want a room.
We were gonna try to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky.
- Looks like a bad day coming, doesn't it?
- Okay.
- I'll take you to Cabin 10.
- Better sign in first, hadn't we?
No. That's not necessary.
My boss is paying for this trip and, well, it's 90% business.
He wants practically notarised receipts.
I'd better sign in and get a receipt.
Thank you.
- I'll get your bags.
- Haven't any.
- I'll show you the room, then.
- First time I've ever seen it happen.
You check in any other place in this country without bags and you have to pay in advance.
That receipt.
I'll go on ahead.
All right, there's your receipt.
Now, I'll show you the cabin.
Don't bother yourself. We'll find it.
Sam, we have to go into that cabin and search it, no matter what we're afraid of finding or how much it may hurt.
I know.
Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
I don't know.
But if you had a useless business like this motel, what would you need to get out?
To get a new business somewhere else?
How could we prove that...
Well, if he opens a motel on the new highway in, say, a year...
There must be some proof that exists now, something that proves he got that money away from Marion somehow.
- What makes you sound so certain?
- Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.
Or he felt sorry for me and he was beginning to feel the same way about you.
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.
He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us, unless he was stopped.
And he was stopped.
So he must have found out something.
We'll start with Cabin One.
If he sees us, we're just taking the air.
Bates.
- No shower curtain.
- Sam!
- Look!
- What is it?
It's figuring.
It didn't get washed down. Look.
Some figure has been added to or subtracted from 40,000.
That proves Marion was here.
- It'd be too wild a coincidence...
- Bates never denied she was here.
Well, doesn't that prove that he found out about the money?
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
No.
But that old woman, whoever she is, she told Arbogast something.
I want her to tell us the same thing.
- You can't go up there.
- Why not?
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.
One of us can keep him occupied while the other gets to the old woman.
You'll never be able to hold him still if he doesn't want to be held.
- I don't like you going into that house alone.
- I can handle a sick old woman.
All right, I'll find Bates and keep him occupied.
Wait a minute.
If you get anything out of the mother, can you find your way back to town?
Yes, of course.
If you do get anything, don't stop to tell me.
- You looking for me?
- Why, yes, as a matter of fact.
Wife's taking a nap and I never can keep quiet enough for her, so I just thought I'd look you up and talk.
- Good. You satisfied with your cabin?
- Oh, it's fine.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
I thought it was the people who were alone most of the time who did all the talking when they got the chance.
Here you are doing all the listening.
You are alone here, aren't you?
Drive me crazy.
I think that would be a rather extreme reaction, don't you?
Just an expression.
What I meant was I'd do just about anything to get away.
- Wouldn't you?
- No.
Mrs Bates?
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here,
I'm just doubting that you are.
I think if you saw a chance to get out from under, you'd unload this place.
This place?
This place happens to be my only world.
I grew up in that house up there.
I had a very happy childhood.
My mother and I were more than happy.
You look frightened.
Have I been saying something frightening?
I don't know what you've been saying.
I've been talking about your mother, about your motel.
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?
Buy a new one in a new town where you won't have to hide your mother.
Why don't you just get in your car and drive away from here, okay?
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates?
Or do you already have it socked away?
- Shut up!
- A lot of it. $40,000.
I bet your mother knows where the money is and what you did to get it.
I think she'll tell us.
Where's that girl you came here with?
Where is she?
Mrs Bates...
I'm Norma Bates!
If anyone gets any answers it'll be the psychiatrist.
Even I couldn't get to Norman and he knows me.
- You warm enough, miss?
- Yes.
Did he talk to you?
No.
I got the whole story, but not from Norman.
I got it from his mother.
Norman Bates no longer exists.
He only half-existed to begin with.
And now the other half has taken over, probably for all time.
Did he kill my sister?
Yes. And no.
Well, now look, if you're trying to lay some psychiatric groundwork for some sort of plea, this fellow would like to cop...
A psychiatrist doesn't lay the groundwork.
He merely tries to explain it.
- But my sister is...
- Yes.
Yes, I'm sorry.
The private investigator, too.
If you drag that swamp somewhere in the vicinity of the motel, you'll...
Have you any unsolved missing persons cases on your books?
- Yes, two.
- Young girls?
- Did he confess to...
- Like I said, the mother.
Now, to understand it the way I understood it, hearing it from the mother, that is, from the mother half of Norman's mind, you have to go back 10 years to the time when Norman murdered his mother and her lover.
Now, he was already dangerously disturbed, had been ever since his father died.
His mother was a clinging, demanding woman, and for years the two of them lived as if there was no one else in the world.
Then she met a man, and it seemed to Norman that she threw him over for this man.
Now, that pushed him over the line and he killed them both.
Matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of all, most unbearable to the son who commits it.
So he had to erase the crime, at least in his own mind.
He stole her corpse.
A weighted coffin was buried.
He hid the body in the fruit cellar, even treated it to keep it as well as it would keep.
And that still wasn't enough.
She was there, but she was a corpse.
So he began to think and speak for her, give her half his life, so to speak.
At times he could be both personalities, carry on conversations.
At other times, the mother half took over completely.
He was never all Norman, but he was often only Mother, and because he was so pathologically jealous of her, he assumed that she was as jealous of him.
Therefore, if he felt a strong attraction to any other woman, the mother side of him would go wild.
When he met your sister, he was touched by her, aroused by her.
He wanted her.
That set off the jealous mother, and Mother killed the girl.
After the murder,
Norman returned as if from a deep sleep, and, like a dutiful son, covered up all traces of the crime he was convinced his mother had committed!
Why was he dressed like that?
He's a transvestite.
Not exactly.
A man who dresses in women's clothing in order to achieve a sexual change or satisfaction is a transvestite.
But in Norman's case, he was simply doing everything possible to keep alive the illusion of his mother being alive.
And when reality came too close, when danger or desire threatened that illusion, he'd dress up, even to a cheap wig he bought.
He'd walk about the house, sit in her chair, speak in her voice.
He tried to be his mother.
And now he is.
That's what I meant when I said
I got the story from the mother.
You see, when the mind houses two personalities, there's always a conflict, a battle.
In Norman's case, the battle is over, and the dominant personality has won.
And the $40,000? Who got that?
The swamp.
These were crimes of passion, not profit.
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?
- Oh, sure.
- All right.
Thank you.
It's sad when a mother has to speak the words
that condemn her own son,
but I couldn't allow them to believe that I would commit murder.
They'll put him away now, as I should have years ago.
He was always bad,
and in the end he intended to tell them
I killed those girls and that man,
as if I could do anything except just sit and stare,
like one of his stuffed birds.
They know I can't even move a finger, and I won't.
I'll just sit here and be quiet, just in case they do suspect me.
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.
Let them see what kind of a person I am.
I'm not even gonna swat that fly.
I hope they are watching. They'll see.
They'll see and they'll know,
and they'll say,
"Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly."
My dear wife, as the ancient saying goes...
"In wine is truth!"
Insincerity, the mark of a drunkard!
If you could or would for one brief moment... shut that vast, resounding chasm... of a mouth, I should be grateful, madam.
What care you for the deprivations...
I have suffered in the name of marriage?
O mariage de convenance.
O cant, O guile, O mockery!
Oh, shut up.
Oh, how can you insult me so?
Very easily, madam.
I have but to listen to your fatuous brain.
Do you hear his churlish insults, Father?
Father!
Huh? What? What?
Sugar? Yes, here you are.
Oh, whatever possessed me to marry you?
That is a question I oft inquire of myself, madam... to which there is no satisfactory answer... save one, perhaps, and that is that no one else would have you.
Only a man who drinks could talk like that.
We escape the unendurable however we can.
How I despise you!
Poor, abused Amaryllis.
You never cared a fig for me.
You only courted me to gain control of father's business.
What other reason could there be?
Oh! Did you hear that?
Does he ever?
Father!
Huh? What? Huh?
I gave the sugar to you once.
There!
Shall I give him some medicine?
Pretty close.
Merely for purposes of enlightenment, Mr. Trumbull.
I could have been the greatest opera singer in the world.
What world?
Would the vocal emissions of a laryngitic crow... be qualifications?
Yes, then, perhaps, you could have been.
What know you of art and beauty?
Tosspot, soak, inebriate!
Your mouth, madam.
Shut it!
Anybody could be proud to rest in this coffin.
You can't even keep our heads above water!
Why, you've only had one customer in the past 9 months.
My father had a thriving undertaking business... until you proceeded to get ahold of it... and run it into the ground!
Where else?
A thriving business.
The receipts of which he used... to cram this house with monstrosities!
If my father chose to spend his hard-earned profits... in the collection of curious objects...
He did more than collect curious objects, madam.
He also fathered one.
I despise you!
Demon rum will get you yet!
I look forward to that day with keen anticipation, madam.
Oh, what I wouldn't do to get her down here as a customer.
Good afternoon, Mr. Tremble.
Trumbull!
Will you learn to pronounce my name correctly?
I said Mr. Tremble.
What in the name of all that's holy is that thing?
This?
This is the new coffin.
I don't like to see anybody buried naked.
I don't... I just don't...
No one in their right mind would be caught dead in that thing.
My coffin.
How gratifying, Mr. Gillie... to have a master craftsman in one's employ.
Well, I'm going out and drink myself... into a state of stupefaction.
Mr. Trumbull.
Oh, how do you do, Mr. Black?
How nice to see you, sir.
That remains to be seen, sir.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a singularly pressing...
A boon, sir.
A trifling matter of a year's rent in arrears.
Has it been a year?
Each and every unpaid day of it.
Well, what do you know about that?
And much as I regret to dun you, dear sir... it is unhappily incumbent upon me... as owner of these premises... to regard your monetary dereliction as... shall we say, inconvenient to my purposes.
Oh, well, now I...
So vastly inconvenient, one might add... that should the debt remain outstanding... for as much as 24 hours more...
I fear that... legal machinery must... perforce, be set in motion.
And Messrs. Hinchley and Trumbull... face the incommodious prospect... of taking up residence in the street.
In the street?
Have I expressed myself with clarity, Mr. Trumbull?
With extreme clarity, Mr. Black.
Then we are of one mind...
Our mutual interests in accord.
24 hours, Mr. Trumbull.
Good day to you, sir.
Good day to you... you penny-pinching old pig.
Mr. Trumbull?
And as for you, you sniveling...
To forego the glories of an operatic career for him.
No, no, Cleopatra.
No, no, sweetheart.
Oh, I came up here to... to get a glass of water. lf... if he continues mistreating you like that, I'll...
I wouldn't know what to do.
Beautiful.
Will you stop that ungodly caterwauling!
Must have been an earthquake.
Mr. Gillie!
In the parlor.
Drunk again, huh?
John Barleycorn and Hinchley.
They're the partners in this business.
Time for your medicine, old man.
Oh, thank you.
Father!
Do you really think I'm going to let you poison my own father?
Hope springs eternal in the human... yes.
Why do you always take my medicine away?
Don't you care nothing about my health?
Yes, sit down, Mr. Gillie.
Comfortable, Mr. Gillie?
Well, Mr. Gillie...
I am afraid that it is... decision time.
Decision time?
Yes, Mr. Gillie.
Business being, once more on the trembling verge of ruin... it behooves us to acquire a bit of income.
Therefore, Mr. Gillie, it is necessary that we... venture forth tonight.
Not so soon again!
Yes, so soon again, Mr. Gillie.
What if I refuse?
If you refuse, Mr. Gillie... which possibility
I find most remote... however, if you refuse,
Mr. Gillie... the local constabulary shall forthwith be apprised... of sundry illicit peccadillos... in which one Mr. "G" has been involved.
Peccadillos?
What if I tell them the truth?
And tell them that it was your idea in the first place?
Mr. Gillie...
Felix...
Friend...
I put it to you.
Who, in your discerning estimation... do you think they're most likely to believe?
Mr. W. Trumbull, respected citizen... and entrepreneur of death... or Mr. Felix Gillie... wanted fugitive and confessed bank robber?
I've never confessed!
They just proved it.
One of these days...
One of these days, I...
One of these days what, Mr. Gillie?
Nothing.
Exactly, Mr. Gillie.
Nothing.
Shall we say...
Midnight?
Midnight it is.
All right.
You are most accommodating,
Mr. Gillie.
Until midnight, then.
He's a perfectly delightful old gentleman.
Owns a fleet of merchant vessels operating out of Boston.
He and I enjoyed a most delightful afternoon... of conversation together at the White Bull Tavern.
Later on, I walked him home.
Lives in a marvelous old house out there on Winkle Road.
Wait till you see it!
Well, come on.
- I have an idea.
- What?
I'll wait for you right here.
Mr. Gillie, without your cunning fingers... how should I gain entrance?
Come on!
All right.
Get to work.
You know, the next time they catch me with these tools... it can be 30 years.
It's no wonder they caught you the last time.
You're probably the most inept... house breaker in all of New England.
That's true.
Did you try the knob?
No, why?
Quiet.
Quiet, quiet.
Pardon me.
Quiet!
I didn't mean to do it.
If they didn't hear that... they must all be as deaf as old Hinchley.
I didn't mean to.
Come on.
I don't like this.
What are you doing?
- Quiet. Get up.
- My foot...
- Get up.
- Your foot, my fingers.
Get up.
Come on.
If you make one more sound...
Now, you sit there,
Mr. Gillie... and don't you make a sound, Mr. Gillie.
As a matter of fact, don't you even breathe, Mr. Gillie.
Do you understand me?
Exactly.
I shall return presently.
Fait accompli, Monsieur Gillie.
The stream flowed, lapping, lapping... and the leaves stirred, tapping, tapping... and the ancient belle dames napping.
Dreamed of gently rapping, rapping.
Rapping gently with a hammer on a baby's skull.
Asleep yet, Mr. Gillie?
How can I sleep when
I know what you've done?
A little medicinal nip?
No, thank you.
More's the pity.
And a white brooch...
Well, thus we end our lonely vigil, Mr. Gillie.
Forward!
Dear child.
Dear child, what is amiss?
Oh, sir, my master has, to all appearances... succumbed in his sleep, and I must run to fetch the doctor.
Oh, cataclysmic circumstance.
Perhaps I can be of assistance.
Oh, sir, could you?
Well, I believe I could.
Take me to your mistress.
Oh, yes, sir. Thank you.
Oh, not at all, my dear.
Not at all.
It is my pleasure to help.
Hinchley and Trumbull are always at your beck and call.
I am afraid, madam, that he has made... his final crossing to that Gidgeon shore.
What?
He's dead.
Allow me, madam, in this moment... of your most desolate bereavement... to lift from your sorrow-laden shoulders... the burdensome tasks of exequy and sepulture.
What?
I'll bury him for you.
For by the most coincidental of vicissitudes, madam...
I happen to be the owner and director... of a local funeral parlor.
You are?
Yes, indeed.
As we like to say to those we serve...
"When loved ones lie on the lonely couch...
"of everlasting sleep...
"let Hinchley and Trumbull draw the covenant."
How tender.
Yes, isn't it?
Remove the carcass.
Where in the name of blue blazes is she?
Play! Go on.
Now?
No, not now, you old fool!
We have to wait for the damned widow to get here.
Huh, what?
Oh, yes, yes.
He does look very natural.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
Never mind.
Is your mistress here?
No, sir. No one is.
What?
What's happened?
Where is the widow Phipps?
Gone to Boston, sir... with everything.
She's going to live in Europe.
Europe?
Yes, sir.
She's discharged all the servants.
They've all gone home but me.
And she left nothing?
- Sir?
- No money?
Not a penny, sir.
Well, what about my fee?
Oh, sir, I don't know.
She didn't even pay me my wages.
Is there no morality left in this world?
Don't you think you've had eno...
Shut your mouth.
Women!
As soon put your trust in them as put a pistol to your head.
- You really...
- Be still!
Old Ben Johnson, buried standing up.
Can't trust anybody these days.
The world is full of knaves and felons.
Don't you think that you're being overly...
Be silent!
Edward III... buried with his horse.
Just because one customer...
Are you gonna shut your mouth or not?
- Mr. Tremble.
- Trumbull!
I said Mr. Tremble.
Well?
Pardon me.
Alexander the Great, embalmed in honey, so they say.
Egyptians used to hollow 'em out and pour 'em full of resin.
Will you shut the old goat up?
Don't you dare refer to my father...
And you shut up, too.
Egyptians used to bend 'em in two... and stick 'em in a vase of salt water.
Father.
And give 'em false eyes.
Father, please.
- Medicine old man?
- Don't you dare!
Yank their brains out with a hook.
- Father!
- Huh? What? Huh?
Oh, there you are.
You're eatin' much too much sugar.
You know that, don't you?
My medicine!
I'll have you arrested.
Mr. Gillie?
In the parlor.
Excuse me.
Of course.
There you go, keeping my medicine away from me again.
I don't believe you care... whether your poor old father lives or dies.
- Do you want me?
- Yes, Mr. Gillie.
We are going out again tonight, Mr. Gillie.
- Tonight?
- Yes, I said tonight.
- Tonight?
- Don't try to argue with me.
- I said tonight!
- Tonight?
What if the same thing happens... that happened to us the other night?
Well, it's never happened before, has it?
But what if it does happen?
Are we going to go out another night and another night... and look for another man and another...
We'll pick someone who isn't married, Mr. Gillie.
And how are you going to do that?
Wake up everybody before you do that horrible thing to him... and ask him whether he's married?
Or are you just going to kill off any old man... that comes your way?
Mr. Trumbull, sir,
Mr. Black wanted...
"Dear sir...
"If total payment for the past year's rent...
"is not received by morning...
"I shall instigate proceedings for eviction.
"Signed John F. Black, Esquire."
Mr. Black.
Precisely, Mr. Gillie.
To paraphrase the venerable adage... we shall kill 2 birds with one pillow.
We just can't go on like this forever.
Oh, nonsense, Mr. Gillie.
This is a sizable community... with more than an adequate supply of... of customers.
Take Mr. Black, for instance.
He's a widower and therefore no risk of a mercenary widow bolting with a plunder of inheritance.
And besides, with him, there's a double profit.
The only thing that bothers me... is why I never thought of it before.
There must be a little more honest way... to conduct a funeral business.
I might expect that kind of talk from a criminal.
Stop.
Whoa! Whoa!
Having a little trouble, Mr. Gillie?
This dirty lock was never made for picking.
Then why don't you take an ax and chop it open?
Nobody, but nobody, tells
Gillie what to do with locks.
No, I take it back.
What you need is a keg of gunpowder.
Hey, I have an idea.
Maybe there's a bolt on the inside.
There's a bolt on the inside of your head, Mr. Gillie, and it's loose.
But that has nothing to do with doors.
Then what about the front door?
Certainly that has a bolt, too.
Then try the windows.
All these windows?
That is not my specialty.
It's an order, Mr. Gillie.
All right. I'll try.
Well?
It's impossible to get inside.
Even the windows?
Every one of them has a bolt.
Why, of all the distrustful...
Well, I will not be denied.
Mr. Tremble...
Trumbull.
Mr. Tremble, I know, but what are you going to do?
Fly down the chimney?
None of your sauce, Mr. Gillie.
Thinks he can keep me out, does he?
You're positive about the front door?
Positive.
And the windows are all bolted?
Bolted.
You refer, of course, to the downstairs windows?
What?
What do you mean by "downstairs windows?"
Are you thinking of...
I think you are thinking of...
- No.
- Yes.
No, no.
Ascend, Mr. Gillie.
Well, don't caress it,
Mr. Gillie. Climb it.
We're not doing very well, are we, Mr. Gillie?
I told you I was not very good in climbing.
You're not very good at anything... are you, Mr. Gillie, unless it's bungling.
Get up!
It's not my fault... that all the doors and windows are closed.
Shut up!
Here.
Thank you, Mr. Tremble, thank you.
What did you step in?
Well, clean your boots off, for pity's sake.
I tried.
Couldn't you get somebody else?
No, I have my heart set on Black.
Now, come.
Let's try again.
All right, I'll try, but I can't promise.
Now grab the roof.
What do you think I'm...
I'm trying to do?
Well, do it before you break my back.
Here I go.
Well, go then!
Planning to spend the night up there, are you?
Definitely not.
I don't think this is a good idea.
Go on!
Go on, get on up there.
Why did I ever escape from prison?
It was so peaceful there.
You're gonna open that door for me if it takes you all night.
"Turn, hell-hound, turn!
"Of all men else
I have avoided thee:
"but get thee back;
"my soul is too much charged with blood of thine already.
"I have no words: my voice is in my sword:
"thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out!
"Thou losest labor:
"as easy mayst thou the intrenchant air...
"that thy keen blade impress as make me bleed:
"let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
"I bear a charmed life...
"that must not yield, to one of woman born.
"Despair thy charm;
"and let the angel whom thou still hast served...
"tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb untimely ripp'd."
"Accursed be that tongue that tells me so...
"for it hath cow'd my better part of man!
"And be these juggling fiends no more believed...
"that palter with us in a double sense..."
Come on, go to sleep.
"And break it to our hope.
"I'll not fight with thee.
"Then yield thee, coward, and live to be the show...
"and gaze o' the time:
"we'll have thee as our rarer monsters are...
"painted upon a pole and underwrit...
"'Here may you see the tyrant.'
"I will not yield...
"to kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet...
"and to be baited with the rabble's curse."
Crazy as a bedbug.
"Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane...
"and thou opposed, being of no woman born...
"yet will I try the last.
"Before my body I throw my warlike shield.
"Lay on, Macduff, and damn'd be he who first cries...
"'Hold, enough!"'
Have at you, sir!
Who are you?
Gillie is my name.
Help! Help!
Get up. Get up!
Where am I?
Outside of Mr. Black's house.
- Do you know what happened?
- No. What?
He recited a hymn or something.
Then he chased me with a big sword.
Ow.
You rang, sir...
Sir!
Get up! We've got to make a run for it.
You've bungled it again.
It wasn't my fault.
Oh, no, it's never your fault, is it?
It's always...
Is that Black's servant?
Where's he going?
I know where he's going.
- Where?
- To the police.
Well, follow him.
Stop him! Go on.
A fine mess you've made of things again.
Servant, where are you going?
To fetch the doctor, sir.
My master's unconscious on his bed.
- He's dying.
- Dying?
Dying.
I wanted you to stop him.
Why did you let him go?
Why? Because Mr. Black is dying.
Oh.
Oh, how sad.
This man is dead.
Are you positive, Doctor?
I beg your pardon.
No offense intended, sir.
It's simply that
Mr. Black has been... subject to catalepsy for several years now.
- Oh.
- Oh, yes.
Several times he's presumed to have died... only to revive some hours later.
I see. Well, I'm quite surely positive he's dead.
But if you wish, I'll apply a few more tests.
Oh, if you would, sir, if only to be absolutely certain.
All right.
He left the window open.
I'm sorry, but your master is quite dead.
Up, down.
Up and down all night long.
Up and down and up...
He has departed the earth, tenderhearted his soul... no longer by grief invaded, and music lingers from...
Yes?
Good evening.
Mr. Black and I have an appointment.
Pick up your end, Mr. Gillie.
You're dragging.
My end must be heavier than... than your end.
You're going too fast, Mr. Tremble.
Butterfingers.
He's... he's pretty heavy for such a skinny bird.
He probably has all his gold sewed up inside of him.
All right... 1, 2, 3...
There.
Well, how nice to see you here, Mr. Black.
We are not going to embalm him tonight.
We haven't embalmed anybody in 6 years.
Why should we start now?
- I just thought...
- Well, don't!
You don't do it very well.
Me for bed.
And me for getting the horses to bed.
Honestly, if it... if it weren't for poor Amaryllis...
I don't think...
Did you speak?
Now what in the name of heaven is wrong with you?
Well, what about him?
I don't... I don't think... he's quite dead enough yet to bury.
You don't think he's quite dead enough yet to...
What... place is this?
You.
Not me!
Mr. Trumbull...
This man...
W-what am I doing here?
You're here because you're dead, Mr. Black.
The hell I am!
Oh, yes, you are.
Everybody else knows you're dead, Mr. Black... except apparently you.
What jiggery-pokery is this?
Not jiggery-pokery, Mr. Black.
Hinchley and Trumbull
Funeral Parlor.
You wouldn't dare.
Have we a choice, Mr. Black?
Dead, huh?
That's what the doctor said.
Well, he's dead now.
Let's put him in the casket.
I don't even want to see him anymore.
You're not going to bury him in it, are you?
In our one good casket?
Are you out of your mind?
Here we go.
Well.
Me for bed.
Me, too.
What, by...
Oh, no.
What place is this?
Shut the lid!
What are you trying to do?
Break my hand?
Come on, come on.
Be a nice boy and stay in there where you belong.
No! No! No!
What's the matter with that idiot?
Doesn't he know when to quit?
Let me out of here!
We most certainly will not let you out of here, sir.
Confound you, sir!
Confound you, too, sir!
Will you kindly have the goodness to die?
Never!
Help!
Let me out!
For a man in his condition... he certainly has a lot of energy.
The stubborn crackpot.
I could have sworn he was dead.
It's about time.
I've never had such an uncooperative customer... in my whole life.
I regard your actions as inimical to good fellowship.
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Oh, yes.
- Leave me alone.
- Oh, yes, we do.
He bit me!
The son of a bit me!
- Let me out of here!
- Hand me that mallet.
Let me... out of...
Get me a gag and some chain.
- Mr. Tremble.
- Trumbull.
I said Tremble.
Everybody's here.
All right. Tell them we'll be ready in a minute.
Is he dead?
Yes. Now, get out of here.
Ungrateful employer.
He is not dead but sleepeth
He is not dead at all
His eyes will open and he will see
The beauties of eternity
He is not dead but sleepeth
He is not dead at all
I wish she would have picked another song.
I wish her vocal cords would snap.
He is not dead but sleepeth
He hath not left our side
For constantly
Could we but view
He watches everything we do
He is not dead but sleepeth
He is not dead
At all
Huh? What? What?
You know, if Mr. Black wasn't dead already... that note would kill him.
My friends, we have gathered ourselves together... within these bog-grieved walls... to pay homage to the departed soul of... what's-his-name... whom the pious and unyielding fates have chosen to pluck... from the very prime of his existence... and place in the bleak sarcophagus of all eternity.
That's pretty good.
Very good, huh?
And so, my friends, we find ourselves... gathered 'round the bier of Mrs...
Mr. You-Know-Who.
This litter of sorrow, this can, this cromlech... this dread dokhma, this gut, this mastaba... this sorrowing dope, this unhappy cumulus... this... this... what is the word?
This... coffin.
Never could think of that word.
Requiescat in pace,
Mister... Mister...
The memory of your good deeds... will not perish with your untimely sepulture.
In the hearts of those who love you, you will live on.
Of all the tricky, underhanded deceitfulness... not to even tell us that this thing... is going to be put into a crypt instead of into the ground.
Now we're gonna have to buy another one... for the... for the services.
I'll be very glad to build a new one.
It's like parting from an old friend.
Good-bye, old friend.
Maybe someday we can exchange it.
And do what with the body?
Same as we always do, take it out of the box.
But they'd see it.
No, I'm afraid we're just gonna have to buy another casket... and after having used this one for only 13 years.
Only 13 years?
You know, I wonder what idiot... ever thought of putting bodies in a crypt... instead of in the ground where they belong.
Yeah, and they fertilize plants, too.
What a terrible thing to say. Shut up.
At least we have some money coming in.
Yes, we have.
Did I say "we"?
No, never.
A good day to thee, sir.
And a good day to thee, sir.
Have thee a good sleep.
What place is this?
Ouch!
Oh, you're my angel.
- You're my angel.
- Well, ain't you classy.
I must. I must, I must.
Forbear, Felix.
Forbear, forbear.
I don't know what that word means... but I can't take it any longer.
I... I can't take it!
I'm so sensitive.
Mr. Trumbull?
Waldo?
Aren't you coming to bed... husband?
Get outta here.
Waldo, don't be like that.
Get away from me!
Am I so repulsive?
That's the word, yes.
Couldn't you find it in your heart to love me, Waldo?
- Well?
- Get up!
You're sittin' on my money.
Then you reject me?
As long as there's liquor in the house.
Oh?
Very well.
Then I shall not answer for the consequences then.
Very well.
"Then I shall not answer for the consequences then."
What... what... what... what?
What is it?
He's so cruel, so thoughtless.
All he thinks about is his bottle.
Never of me.
Pardon me.
Better take him upstairs.
Him?
Upst...
Felix...
Oh, Amaryllis!
Oh, darling!
Please, run away with me.
Be my wife. Be my love.
I'll let you study opera.
I'll let you study music, anything, anything.
Oh, Felix. Oh, mon amour.
Everything is going to be so magnifique.
Rain, rain, goeth thee away
Come thee again some other day
What manner of cry be that?
Do... do... do thee not choose to sleep, sir?
Well, if thee insist... perhaps thee have a reason not to sleep, sir.
I'll ask thee.
Have thee patience, have thee patience.
I'm comin'.
It's not customary that I waken in the middle of the night.
For that, be grateful.
"Is this a dagger that I see before me?
"The handle toward my hand?
"Come, let me clutch thee."
Now, we... we must have a little talk, sir.
For thee too must sleep, like all the others.
Out!
"Therefore Macbeth shall sleep no more.
"I have done the deed.
"Didst thou not hear a noise?"
"The time has been that when the brains were out...
"a man would die and there's an end.
"But now..."
Felix, you've stolen my heart
Felix, we'll never part
Felix, Felix
Dites moi, dites moi
Dites moi, mon amour
Just like a nightingale.
"And therefore, Mr. Tremble..."
"Amaryllis and I have fled into the night...
"driven onward by the madness...
"of our all-consuming passion.
"Felix."
Come in.
I said come in!
That's not the front door.
All right, all right,
I'm coming!
Don't be so impatient!
Someone there?
Anyone here? Come on out!
What are you grinning about?
You old goat.
Now, I'm sure that that door was closed.
Something's been opening doors around here.
But what?
Nice Cleopatra.
Dites moi...
C'est vous, Monsieur Gillie?
"Blood will have blood, they say."
Get up.
"The devil damn thee black...
"thou cream-faced loon!
"Thy bones are marrowless, and thy blood is cold!"
Wait for me.
Wait for me!
"Sleep no more!"
"Macbeth doth murder sleep!"
I thought he was dead.
He'll never die.
Oh, good work.
It's a little better in the dark.
What is, decapitation?
"Painted upon a pole!"
"And underwrit!"
Would you let go of me?
Let go of me!
Go and find your own hiding place. Go on.
"Lay on, Macduff!
"And damn'd be he who first cries, 'Hold, enough! '
"Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits!"
"The flighty purpose never is o'ertook...
"unless the deed go with it!"
Thank heavens he's gone.
You!
"Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
"creeps in this petty pace from day to day...
"to the last syllable of recorded time."
"And all our yesterdays..."
"Have lighted fools...
"the way to dusty death.
"Out...
"out, brief candle."
"Life's but a walking shadow..."
"A poor player...
"that struts and frets his hour upon the stage...
"and then is heard no more."
That I'll believe when I see it.
"It is a tale... told... by an idiot."
"Full of sound and fury..."
"Signifying... nothing."
Well, if it was anyone else...
I'd think he was dead, but I...
Oh, Felix!
- Oh, mon coeur.
- What?!
- Oh, you've killed him.
- Me?
You've taken the one really beautiful thing...
And you've killed this poor man.
Poor man? He tried to chop your head off.
Monster!
- Go to bed.
- Go to bed?
I'll tell you where I'm going.
I'm going to the authorities.
I'll see you hang for this!
- Amaryllis, go to bed!
- Never!
- Go to bed, Amaryllis.
- You wouldn't dare!
Oh, no, of course not.
Well... who's next?
Amaryllis?
You. You...
You killed her.
My rose and... and she sang like a nightingale.
And I stilled the voice of the nightingale.
You... you dirty man!
With my... with my bare hands,
I'll kill you! I'll...
I've had enough for one night. Go away!
Oh, put that down.
"An eye for an eye,"
Mr. Tremble.
- Trumbull.
- I said Tremble!
"And a tooth for a tooth!"
Give no quarter!
Take no prisoner!
Forward!
March!
Amaryllis!
Ouch! That hurt.
Oh, what a night.
May I?
Mr. Trumbull?
Oh, Mr. Trumbull,
Mr. Black was seen walking through the streets!
Police!
Oh, to hell with it.
Police!
Well, if you can't lick 'em, join 'em.
What a blow.
Amaryllis, I...
I thought you were dead.
And I thought you were dead.
Isn't that funny?
I... I thought you were dead, and you thought I...
You will sing for me... often.
Anybody there?
Speak up.
Everything seems to be in order.
Bedtime. What? What's that?
Trumbull?
What are you doing on the floor?
Drunk again?
Not feeling well.
What you need is a good dose of your own medicine.
Keep it in your waistcoat, don't you?
There we go.
There.
That ought to take care of you nicely.
Not here to stop me.
Empty.
Whoa, you're feeling better already, huh?
Oh, no good reaching for it.
It's all gone.
You took every last drop of it... and me an old man that needs it more than you do.
That's the way it goes, though.
Let the old man go without.
Stick him in the battle.
Might as well go up to bed.
Nothing going on, as usual.
Nothing ever happens here.
Every day, the same old thing.
No change, no variety.
When I was young... we knew how to live.
See you in the mornin'.
What place is this?
Is there no morality left in this world?
Huh? What? What?!
Husband?
"Out brief candle."
There came a light tap at the library door - and, pale as the tenant of a tomb, a menial entered upon tiptoe.
His looks were wild with terror, and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous, husky, and very low.
What said he?
- some broken sentences I heard.
He told of a wild cry disturbing the silence of the night - of the gathering together of the household - of a search in the direction of the sound; and then his tones grew thrillingly distinct as he whispered me of a violated grave - of a disfigured body enshrouded, yet still breathing - still palpitating - still alive!
He pointed to garments; they were muddy and clotted with gore.
I spoke not, and he took me gently by the hand: it was indented with the impress of human nails.
He directed my attention to some object against the wall.
I looked at it for some minutes: it was a spade.
With a shriek I bounded to the table, and grasped the box that lay upon it.
But I could not force it open; and in my tremor, it slipped from my hands, and fell heavily, and burst into pieces; and from it, with a rattling sound, there rolled out some instruments of dental surgery, intermingled with thirty-two small, white and ivory-looking substances that were scattered to and fro about the floor.
They were the thirty-two magnificent teeth of my cousin Berenice,
The teeth that had obsessed me during her illness, and which, six months after her death,
I had found again during a horrible night when I no longer remembered what I had done and what had befallen me.
I know that story. It's by you.
It almost seems real when you tell it.
- Who are you?
- Alan Foster, journalist for the Times.
You're the one who's been after me for the last five days.
You refused to see me. It was the only way to get an interview.
It's not every day that
Edgar Allan Poe shows up in London.
Yes, it's the first time
I've been in England and certainly the last.
London has disappointed you so much?
Life has disappointed me.
Please sit down.
I admit that I'm not a fiction writer.
I'm one of your colleagues.
I'm a chronicler.
My tales are drawn from real facts.
Real in your writer's teeming imagination.
No. It's simply a matter of true cases, my young friend.
I'm not a child. There's only seven years' difference between us.
Seven?
No. Between us, there are centuries and a word that doesn't exist:
Death.
You're really extraordinary.
If death is really the only sure thing, then...
You confuse the grave with death, my young friend.
The marble slab of a sepulcher proves the existence of the grave, but not of what lies beyond the grave, a world inhabited by an incalculable number of anonymous beings.
Don't make fun of me.
An intelligent man like you couldn't believe in the beyond except for poetic purposes.
I thank you for treating me like a fool in such an elegant way.
That was not at all my intention.
I admire and respect you too much to talk to you in such a manner.
But I'm convinced that the cycle of life finishes with death, in the grave.
Beyond, there is the void, nothingness.
Therefore, nothing material, nothing concrete.
The spirit is impalpable without the body which is the essence of living beings.
The dead cannot return to earth, as they do in your stories, much less frighten us.
As for me, I'm very afraid, but only of the living, who stop doing harm only after their death.
Permit me, sir?
I am Lord Thomas Blackwood.
I wager 100 pounts that you will not be able to spend the night in my castle in Providence.
You think that I would run away, blinded by fear?
No, you won't run away.
All those who accepted my wager died in the castle.
I'm sorry, but I can't accept your wager.
You're right, my young friend.
I heard of this castle located on Providence hill, when I arrived in London.
The last ones to enter it were a young couple on their honeymoon.
The husband was a cousin of my wife.
Lord Thomas will correct me if I'm wrong, but it's my understanding that they never left it again.
- They stayed there because they liked it.
I doubt they vanished into thin air!
Dead or alive, they left the castle.
Forgive me for contradicting you, but Mr. Poe is right.
They never left the castle.
They are resting there, in the family cemetery.
Every year, I search for a brave man to take up my challenge, in the hope of clearing up the mystery of this terrifying legend.
You are very nice, and I'm happy that you have refused my wager.
It's not that I don't want to, but I can't, my lord.
A hundred pounds, that's too great a sum for the pocket of an honest journalist.
- But ten pounds...
- You'll accept for ten pounds?
- Whenever you like.
- It must be tonight... the night of the dead.
Today is the first of November.
From midnight to dawn, the dead return to the castle to relive the tragedies of their deaths.
Very well! Tonight, my theory will be confirmed, and I'll write a sensational article about the castles of terror.
Think well, my young friend.
Everything's been thought of.
I'll finish the interview, and we'll go.
We must leave now.
The castle is far. It will take at least two hours by coach.
Yes, but I have to write my article.
If that's the only thing that keeps you, we can talk on the way, for I don't mind accompanying you.
It's a great honor, Mr. Poe.
In that case, let's go. Would you mind if we stop for a moment at my newspaper?
All right.
Thank you, gentlemen, good night.
Have you ever tried writing stories based on reality?
Reality... always voyages beyond, outside, or beneath all the forms established by society or by the mind, to the abysses, to the bottom of the sea, to the South Pole.
Of all melancholy topics, what, according to the universal understanding of mankind, is the most melancholy?
Death is the obvious reply.
And when is this most melancholy of topics most poetical? When it most closely allies itself to Beauty.
The death then of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world.
We've arrived.
You can still withdraw and return with us.
Your ten pounds are too tempting.
- Think carefully.
- Thanks for the interview, and I hope Lord Thomas's ghosts will let me publish it.
We'll come back at dawn.
Good luck.
Good luck, my young friend.
You'll find torches under the staircase.
Thank you.
Don't let yourself be influenced by this atmosphere.
All this is absurd.
These suspicious noises, these strange apparitions must have a rational explanation!
To doubt, even if only for a second, means to be afraid.
It's an optical illusion.
It's very simple.
It's just an optical illusion.
Did my brother send you?
If your brother is
Lord Thomas Blackwood, then yes.
My name is Alan Foster.
My name is Elisabeth.
Your brother told me that the castle was unoccupied.
Yes, I know what he says.
- To him, I'm dead.
- Dead?
He refuses to see me ever since I left his world to seek happiness here.
Haven't you been able to persuade him to reconcile with you?
No, I've stayed alone.
Maybe it's better that I go away.
Are you afraid of me?
No, but if I had known,
I wouldn't have accepted this wager.
Of course...
The famous wager that my brother offers each year in order to give me company for one night and to nourish the legend that surrounds this castle.
Are these stories true?
They are fantastic stories.
They're coincidences, chance occurrences.
Don't you want to win the wager?
Has anyone won it before me?
The past matters little.
Now, there is just you, me, and a hundred pounds.
To tell the truth,
I bet only ten pounds.
I'm not as rich as you think.
You won't become rich, but you can help me put one over on milord.
Come.
I've prepared your room on this floor.
You knew I was coming?
Of course.
You, or someone else...
Every year, someone comes on this night.
On this night... the night of the dead!
- Are you afraid?
- Who blew them out?
No one!
Everything goes out and lights up again sometimes, surely you know that.
You're trembling.
It's cold here.
Must it be up to me, a woman, to put you at ease?
- I thought you were braver than that...
- Look!
- What?
- The painting.
Once again the candlelight has played tricks with me.
Tricks?
A simple optical illusion.
The portrait of your ancestor looked to me like a living image.
Julia doesn't belong to the Blackwood family.
And what's more, she's my age.
Forgive me, I keep saying stupid things.
Please offer my excuses to Lady Julia, though I don't have the honor of knowing her.
I'm sure you'll know her soon.
I found it on the ground in the stable.
- I brought it up, thinking that...
- Thank you.
I've been looking for it for a long time.
I had lost it.
Strange! I was expecting to spend a terrifying night and I find myself in such charming company.
If you're referring to me, you won't be disappointed.
I don't disappoint people I like...
And I like you.
But Julia is very mistrustful, especially toward men.
Here we are.
Here things are a little more in order.
I have no servants anymore, and I've neglected the ground floor.
But these rooms are still pleasant.
Come close to me, Alan.
Tell me about the world outside, and tell me about yourself.
There's nothing new in London.
Fog, boredom, and eternal traditions.
You see, London hasn't changed.
You haven't missed anything by staying in this castle.
It's we Londoners who have been deprived of the pleasure of admiring your charm and your beauty.
You are very nice, and you have the art of making yourself agreeable in a woman's eyes.
I say what I think.
It's not a compliment.
It's been a long time since I felt myself so much a woman.
You wanted me to speak of myself, too.
I am poor, a bachelor, and without family.
I'm thirty years old, I'm a journalist, and I feel terribly alone.
I'm desperately alone, too.
May I join you?
Happy to make your acquaintance.
Miss Julia.
Elisabeth has told you about me?
She only satisfied my curiosity, because your portrait interested me.
But you are even more beautiful.
You flatter me.
What did she tell you?
Your name. Only your name.
Should I be grateful, and thank you for your discretion?
No. It would have been better if you hadn't come.
Why? Perhaps I'm bothering you?
Not at all. We were talking about London and about me, before going to bed.
Together, of course.
What are you saying?
Excuse me, I didn't mean to refer to what Elisabeth was imagining.
I meant "at the same time,"
- and not in the same bed.
- Stop it!
Good night, Foster.
Good night.
I, too, wish you a good night even if it's without her.
I don't understand you.
Don't lie, Alan.
You don't know how to lie.
Who told you my first name?
No one. I heard Elisabeth say it when I came in.
Good night.
I'm telling you for the last time: stop insulting me, humiliating me, persecuting me.
You don't know what I'm capable of.
I know you.
What can you do to me?
Kill me, perhaps?
You can't.
- And so?
- Be quiet!
It's not enough for you that you've ruined my life?
Why do you persecute me like this?
You like Alan, don't you?
- Admit you like him.
- Yes! I like him.
- And I desire him!
- You don't love him...
Yes, yes, I love him!
You poor thing, if I hadn't been there, you'd be happy in his arms.
Happy?
Maybe with him
I would have been happy.
No, it's not true.
You've never been happy.
But, this time,
I had a kind of premonition.
Julia, I beg you,
I entreat you, leave me one last chance.
No, you will only be happy beside me.
Get out! I am a woman, do you understand?
A real woman.
Get out of my life!
What life, Elisabeth ?
Do you know what you're saying?
I despise you, I hate you, Julia!
"I'll wait for you at midnight in the park under the big oak tree. Herbert."
Excuse me, I wanted to see if you were sleeping.
I was going to go back to bed without waking you.
I was going to read a very interesting book.
I never sleep before dawn because I spend all my nights at the newspaper.
- May I stay a little while?
- Of course.
One would have to be stupid or abnormal to refuse the company of a beautiful woman like you.
"Carmus."
This isn't the best thing before sleeping.
But if you were going to read, I'll go...
No, please stay.
There are so many things to read in your eyes.
The things that are written in my eyes, Alan:
"Kiss me."
"Hold me close to you."
"I'm yours."
"Take me" - that's what's written there.
Yes, take me.
Maybe your warmth can save me from this cold that imprisons me hopelessly.
Take me, kiss me, my love.
Alan, I'm alive only when I love.
Bitch! I knew it.
I knew it would end with this.
- Where are you going?
- Let me go.
This doesn't concern you.
I still love her.
Don't do this.
Why? So that I can always be treated like this?
Herbert must know about it, immediately!
We met each other too late.
My love, the main thing is that I've found you.
Now we'll be together always.
Always separated.
I, in my world, and you... in yours, far from here.
My world will be yours, Elisabeth.
I can't go back.
I don't belong to it anymore.
Elisabeth !
- What is it, Alan?
- I was so frightened.
It seemed as if your heart wasn't beating.
My heart doesn't beat.
It hasn't beaten for ten years.
I am dead.
Elisabeth!
It's not possible!
Yes, everything is possible, tonight.
Don't worry about Elisabeth.
But she's disappeared!
She'll come back.
She's wounded. We must take care of her.
- It's useless.
- Useless?
You're all mad here.
When will you understand that...
She's already being taken care of.
Trust me.
Who are you?
- I am Dr. Carmus.
- Carmus?
- The famous medical researcher?
- Yes.
We had no news of you for some time.
We thought you were...
Dead?
I stopped living a futile existence in a world that made it impossible for me to complete my studies.
You have had a shock.
You need to drink something strong.
Come.
There's a stock of excellent whisky in my study.
Sit down.
Relax, Foster.
- Your name is Foster, isn't it?
- How did you know?
I heard you speaking with Elisabeth.
- You...
- Yes, I saw everything.
I heard everything, but there was no way for me to intervene.
You'll understand why.
Sit down, relax, and drink your whisky.
I don't understand.
It's as if I were living in a nightmare!
Yet I'm convinced, I'm sure, that
Elisabeth is alive.
I felt her body trembling,
I felt her warmth.
At this moment, she's alive thanks to the power of her senses that do not wish to die.
What do you mean?
Three forms of life exist together in every human being.
That of the body is the most fragile form.
Next, there is the spirit, which is indestructible.
Finally, there are the senses, which are not eternal, but which can survive long after death.
Especially when a human being is torn from life by an act of violence in a moment when the senses are undergoing an intense emotion.
In short, one does not entirely die when one is not ready to die.
That is a totally absurd theory.
But I can demonstrate.
Be careful, this reptile is very poisonous.
At this moment, all its senses are mobilized by a profound instinct of defense.
Theoretically, the snake should have died when I struck the blow.
But it continues to live.
I did this experiment when I was a child, with lizards.
It's true, the body struggles for a few seconds, but then...
There.
Now it has completely ceased living.
Move your hand closer to it.
Be careful!
Its glands are still secreting venom.
The reptile is dead, but its defense instinct survives.
Not for long.
When the blood circulation stops, decomposition begins, leading to the death of the sensory-motor system.
I don't believe your theory can apply to human beings.
You should believe it, because you've seen the proof of it.
You've seen Elisabeth.
You've spoken with her.
You've felt her body trembling in your arms.
Yet,
Elisabeth is buried over there, in the park cemetery.
And the others?
They too are buried there.
They are victims of the same destiny.
What destiny?
Follow me, and you'll find out.
Soon, the dead will relive once again the final episode of their earthly existence.
Only Lord Thomas's perversity could have made you come here tonight.
He takes after his great-grandfather, the first Count of Blackblood.
Blackwood!
He took the name Blackwood.
"Wood" instead of "blood."
He was made a nobleman because he hanged opponents of the Crown.
He was the executioner of London.
Don't be surprised, Foster.
You have many more things to see.
Doctor, I beg you, tell me about Elisabeth.
It's time.
From now on, words are useless.
Look.
- Do you want something to drink?
- Yes, thanks.
- What do you want?
- Leave. Don't stay with him.
Wait for me in the stable.
Go.
I lost sight of you.
- I'm keeping an eye on her.
- Thank you, Julia.
You took over for me while I was gone.
Now, it's my turn.
What a magnificent family portrait!
You're going?
Yes, I'm going back to London.
I have to work tomorrow, and I hate not getting enough sleep.
Before, you used to get up early to hunt. The city has changed you.
I've given up the pleasure of hunting.
It's been a pleasure for me to see you reunited again.
William, try not to leave her alone anymore.
I've sold all my possessions in America.
Now, I travel only for pleasure.
What if we went on a cruise, to visit France, Italy...
That's a good idea.
We'll come see you in London and talk about it again.
- Let me.
- No, I can go with them.
Stay here with the other guests.
Good night.
- Goodbye, Thomas.
- Good night, William.
- Goodbye, my dear.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye, Elisabeth, and have a good time hunting.
- Don't go back to him.
- Stop being stupid, he's my husband.
George, the coach! come on.
You can't go back to him.
You belong to me.
We love each other. We've experienced unforgettable moments.
He'll go away again, Herbert.
Let me go.
No. I know you'll leave with him.
I'll kill you if you go back to him!
- Let me go!
- No!
No, I don't want to.
What you have seen belongs to the past of the Blackwoods.
And it is only a prologue.
The real tragedy begins now.
Come.
I am alive only when I love.
Don't cry, Elisabeth.
I beg you.
It's all over. I'm here.
Don't cry anymore.
- Please, Elisabeth.
- Go away!
- Please.
- Go away.
- Don't push me away.
- I hate you, I despise you.
I like men, do you understand?
No, it's not true.
I hate you, you're a murderess!
Leave me alone.
I can't live with you anymore.
I won't leave you again.
We'll stay together forever.
I'd rather die!
You can't say that, because I -
I love you, Elisabeth.
Stop!
Let me go, Carmus!
No one is holding you.
You are the prisoner of the present.
You cannot cross the threshold of the past.
That's not true.
That's all a lot of nonsense.
The dead live in another space, in another dimension.
I must convince you!
Let me go, and I'll convince you of the contrary, Carmus.
You're wrong again, Foster.
Look, there is nothingness behind you.
Let me go!
Don't try to hide, Carmus!
Where are you, Carmus?
Show yourself, I beg you.
Tell Lord Thomas he has won the wager.
I want to get out of here.
I can't stand it anymore!
Open it!
I know you're there! Open!
I've lost the wager.
I give up!
I'm going mad!
Look out, Carmus!
You have seen how and why
I died.
"Blood is the source of life: only blood revives the dead!
We will drink your blood!"
Marvelous! Our first night will be unforgettable!
A night of love and terror if Lord Blackwood is telling the truth.
Don't leave me.
You are afraid, Mrs. Perkins?
Yes, I'm afraid of cheating on you with a ghost.
Don't go in.
Don't go in.
Stop!
Let me do it.
Don't go up.
You'll be killed!
You want to keep me from leaving.
Very well.
You don't frighten me!
You're dead!
I'm alive!
What was it?
A ghost spying on us through the keyhole.
- Don't be stupid. Go see.
- All right.
I'll be right back.
Elsi!
Now it's your turn,
Foster.
Your hour has struck.
Run away, Alan.
They want your blood.
I beg you, run away!
Follow me. Quickly!
In one hour, it will be dawn.
From now on, you are in our hands.
You can't escape us.
Your fate is sealed.
We don't want to give up life.
Your blood will be our life.
Where were you?
Maybe I can save you. Come.
- You're not with the others?
- I love you.
I've never loved anyone as much as you.
But you're alive!
No, I wanted to be.
I beg you, run away.
Hurry, before it's too late.
They're coming.
Go through the park.
Your life will be safe beyond the gate.
- Come with me.
- No.
You can't take me into a world that is no longer mine.
Let me go!
I'm dead, you must understand!
No, you're alive!
Believe me, you're alive!
- Come.
- No, Alan !
Let me go, please!
I can't follow you!
Let me go!
- I can't go any further.
- Come.
I beg you, let me go.
My love.
You can't escape us.
Your fate is sealed.
We don't want to give up life.
Now your blood is ours.
Your blood will be our life.
You won't escape.
You won't escape.
You won't escape.
You won't escape.
You can't escape us, Alan!
He made it!
He's waiting for us in front of the gate.
Stop, Laster.
Foster!
No one has ever survived the night of the dead.
Unfortunately, you've lost the wager, my boy.
Let's go.
I'll have him buried in the park.
When I write this story, no one will believe it.
As always.
Did you stay for me, Alan?
Yes, Elisabeth.
Kada nostra, kada estra.
Kada nostra, kada estra.
Kada nostra..
...kada estra.
Kada nostra...
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning, my dear.
- Oh, careful.
- Eh?
Oh, I'm sorry. You should know better than to barge in here when I'm busy.
- Busy?
- Now, none of that.
When I'm on holiday this is what keeps me busy.
- Mail, Father.
- I don't want to read it.
- There's a letter from Cornwall.
- I don't know anyone in Cornwall.
Yes, you do. Peter Tompson.
I'll open it.
Oh, Peter.
What's he doing down there?
Oh, Father, you're impossible.
You know he's got a job down there.
He's General Practitioner.
So he did.
What's he up to, then?
Well, why don't you read it and find out?
- No, you read it.
- All right.
Ah... ah... ah... ah!
"Dear Sir James..."
A typical doctor's handwriting. it's worse than yours, Father.
Oh, here. Give it to me.
Hm. "Just a brief line to inform you...
"For some time our village has been...
"beset by a number of mysterious and fatal maladies.
"People have been dying off...
“Lassitude, no will to live...”
Well, this doesn't sound like Peter. it's very rambling.
I wonder what's it's all about.
Well, we could easily find out.
"l desperately need your advice.
Symptoms can't be attributed to..."
- Find out? How?
- By going to Cornwall and asking him.
Go to Cornwall? it's miles away.
Well, you can fish just as well in Cornwall as here, Father.
Didn't your school friend...
What's her name?
Didn't she marry young Tompson?
- Alice? Mm.
- Ha.
I suppose your suggestion that we should go to Cornwall has nothing to do with the fact that you'd like to see her again, eh?
Shall I pack your things?
I don't know why
I give in to you so easily.
And look up the train times.
I don't know why
I put up with you at all.
- I should have drowned you at birth.
- Thank you, Father.
I knew you'd understand.
- Come on, then. Come on, then.
- Whoo!
Oh, look, Father!
Look! A fox!
I've seen a fox.
Several of them, in fact.
I've no doubt your fox looks very similar to all the others.
Oh, they're hunting him!
Father, those men are hunting that fox.
Men have always hunted.
For food, yes. Not for blood lust.
Well, can't you do something, Father?
I have not come all this way to interfere with local customs and antagonise the people just to satisfy your sensitivity about the welfare of wild animals.
Father, you must agree that...
Just because you are my daughter doesn't mean I have to agree to...
Whoa, there!
Now what's happened?
- You, have you seen him?
- Who, sir?
- The fox, you idiot!
- No, I haven't, young sir.
I've been keeping my eyes on the road.
Idiot!
Is it a fox you're looking for?
Well, my dear young lady, that was the idea.
I saw him.
He was running that way.
You'll have to hurry to catch him.
He was running fast.
We'll catch him.
Never fear. Come on.
I have a distinct feeling you were not telling that young man the truth, Sylvia.
Your distinct feeling is correct, Father.
Oh. Well, the fox will be grateful.
I doubt if the same can be said for the young man.
I only hope you don't meet him again.
- What is it, Sylvia?
- A funeral.
Come on!
Come on then. Whoa!
Oh!
What the devil do you think you're doing?
So the fox went that way, did it?
You'd better stay out of my sight, young lady!
How horrible.
They should be reported.
I expect they will be, my dear.
And no doubt those your ruffians will say it was an accident.
- Is there anything we can do, Vicar?
- Yeah, you can keep away from us.
Please, it was not our fault!
Leave us alone!
- But surely...
- I said leave us alone!
I know it wasn't your fault, my dear.
That was the poor lad's brother in the coffin.
The Lord is punishing us for our sins.
Whoa!
Oh, put the bags down there, please, Coachman.
I'm sorry. The doctor isn't in.
- Alice?
- Who is it?
Alice, don't you remember me?
- Sylvia?
- Yes!
Oh, Sir James.
What a wonderful surprise.
Why didn't you let me know?
Well, come in.
Do come in.
Thank you.
- When did you arrive?
- We got here about half an hour ago.
Well, it’s nice seeing you again
Mrs Tompson.
- Oh, Father, call her Alice.
- Yes, please do.
Very well, Alice.
Hello, what's this?
It's nothing. it's just a cut.
- Well, I hope you're taking care of it.
- Oh, don't fuss so much.
Well, you can't be too careful about these things.
Would you like me to have a look at it?
It's all right.
My husband is a doctor.
Ah, yes. So they tell me.
- He is a very good doctor.
- Father is only joking, Alice.
Peter was his favourite pupil, remember?
- Now, let me have a good look at you.
- No!
No, please don’t. I...
I look so untidy
Well, I don't know about that, but you don't look too well to me.
- Are you eating enough?
- Oh, Father, really!
Don't take any notice of him, Alice.
Oh, why didn't you let me know you were coming?
I'm so sorry.
You must think me very inhospitable.
No, not at all, my dear.
If it's inconvenient we can always stay at the inn.
Oh, no. I wouldn't dream of it.
Of course you'll stay here.
It's just that I...
Well, the house isn't very clean.
Can I get you something?
Some tea?
We'd both love some.
Come on.
Kettle won't be a moment.
Hm. I suppose there isn't anything stronger, is there?
Well, I'll ask, but I don't expect...
Oh, don't worry.
I'll slip out later.
Well, where's that husband of yours?
Out on his rounds?
Yes, I expect so.
- Plenty of patients?
- Not as many as we'd like.
Oh, really?
There's been a lot of trouble.
What sort of trouble?
Oh, I...
I expect Peter would rather tell you about it himself.
I'll see to the kettle. Excuse me.
You go and have a gossip about your old school days.
I'll slip into the village and see what I can find out.
All right, Father. Don't be long.
- Charlie.
- Aye, aye.
Will you have a drink with me, Martinus?
Thank you, but I'll buy my own.
Beer, Tom.
I... I did my best for him.
I'm sorry.
- Wasn't good enough, was it?
- Apparently not.
What do you think it were, Doctor?
- That killed him?
- Aye, that killed him.
What was it that killed them all?
I don't know.
You don't know.
And you call yourself a doctor?
You won't let me find out.
If you let me carry out one post mortem.
It's no good cutting him up after he's dead. It's too late.
- You're being ridiculous
- Ridiculous is it?
There's my brother lying dead out there.
And twelve others like him. Twelve.
How long have you been with us, Doctor?
Twelve months, isn't it?
That's one a month.
- Steady, Tom
- One a month.
Not a very good record, is it?
Are you trying to say no one died before I came here?
At least we knew what they died from.
And if I was to tell you they died from swamp fever or the plague or some other nonsense, would that make you happier?
- Yes, if it were the truth.
- Well, it wouldn't be the truth.
I'm not going to start telling a lot of ridiculous lies just to keep you people satisfied.
It's not good enough.
Oh, so we are not good enough for you now?
- I didn't say that.
- it's what you meant, though.
Well, let me tell you something, Doctor.
You're not good enough for us.
Do you understand me?
You're not good enough!
- Ah, Doctor, there you are.
- Sir James!
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Good afternoon.
We've met before in rather distressing circumstances.
May I now introduce myself?
Sir James Forbes, Professor of Medicine at London University.
And this young man was my cleverest and most able pupil.
I hope you realise how lucky you are to have him here.
Landlord, see these gentlemen have a drink with me, will you?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Come on, Peter, are you ready?
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Good afternoon.
- Sir James, what are you doing here?
- You've lost weight, my boy.
- Alice not feeding you properly?
- Yes, but...
- Aren't you glad to see me?
- You've no idea.
- Why have you come?
- You wrote to me.
It's very kind of you to come all this way, sir.
I've just seen Alice.
She's not looking well.
Poor Alice.
I'm afraid she needs a holiday badly.
- You both do, by the look of you.
- Can't manage one at the moment, sir.
- You've no idea what it's been like.
- Well, we'll talk about it later, without any of this hocus pocus you put in your letter.
Ah!
That was an excellent meal.
You girls are to be congratulated, eh, Peter?
Oh, yes, Sir James. Indeed.
Still, what I always say is, cooking is a science and not an art.
If you get it right once there's no earthly reason why you shouldn't get it right every time.
Now, you girls run along to bed.
Peter and I will do the dishes
- But, Father, you can't...
- But Father, nothing.
You've had a long day and I'm sure Alice is tired.
Yes, I am tired, it's true.
Good night, Peter. Father.
Good night, my dear.
It's so nice to see you again, Sir James.
Thank you, my dear. it's nice to see you, too.
For you, Sir James?
No, thank you.
That's not the answer, you know, Peter.
I know.
I wish I knew the answer.
First of all, we have to decide what the question is, don't we?
This disease seems to be more mental than physical.
Yes, but you were a little obscure, Peter.
You said there was no attributable cause for this mental affliction.
I'd like to Know a little more about the symptoms.
- What about appetite?
- The patient show a loss of appetite.
Skin colour?
In every case a loss of skin colour, too.
- Reflexes?
- Retarding
Hm, like someone in need of a holiday in fact, eh?
- You don't mean Alice, surely?
- Now, now, now.
Don't let's jump to any conclusions.
- What did the autopsies show?
- I didn't make any.
You didn't make any?
What's come over you?
It is not permitted to make any.
- Well, who stopped you?
- The villagers.
They don't want the bodies of their love ones cut about.
What about the coroner?
Surely he supported your applications?
- There isn't one.
- No coroner?
This isn't London, sir.
This is a Cornish village, inhabited by simple country people riddled with superstition and all dominated by a Squire.
He acts as coroner and magistrate, judge and jury.
And who is this jack of all trades?
Hamilton, sir. Squire Hamilton.
Master?
Tonight. Tell the others.
They are not back from the chase, Master.
Tell them to prepare just as soon as they return.
I do hope you meet him, Sylvia.
He's such a charming man.
- Is he now?
- And so handsome.
- And rich.
- And unattached?
Yes. Yes, he is, as a matter of fact.
You're not trying to marry me off by any chance?
Well, you could do a great deal worse.
He's got a lovely house and a lot of money.
And what does Peter think?
He doesn't like him.
He thinks he's arrogant and overbearing.
But he's wrong. He is wrong.
- Good night.
- Alice.
You're trying to tell me something else, aren't you?
No!
No, I'm not, but I...
- I must go.
- What did you say his name was again?
Clive Hamilton.
Goodnight, Sylvia.
I'm sorry.
Don't apologise to me, dear boy.
It's your Crockery.
Here, you'd better let me do the drying.
- I really do need a drink.
- Rubbish.
What you need is an end to your worries.
So far we've nothing to start on, nothing to help us at all.
I know.
We must have a body to examine.
We can't possibly work without one.
If you’re thinking of applying for an exhumation...
Apply for nothing.
We'll dig one up.
- We'll what?
- Dig one up.
That lad they buried today will do.
Nice and fresh.
Then we might learn something.
- But we can’t just go out and start...
- We’ll do it tonight.
There's a full moon.
Couldn't be better.
We'll start off about midnight.
Alice.
Alice!
Alice?
Is that you Alice?
Aah!
Wait a minute. I know you.
I know you!
Come on.
Oh!
Oh!
Ah.
Oh, oh.
Go away!
Oh, no. No!
Hey, Tom. Get her off!
Oh, let me go!
Leave me alone. Oh, oh!
- Come on.
- Let go!
Let me go! Let me go!
- Catch.
- Catch.
Oh!
What's it to be, lads?
Aces high?
Aces high.
Cut.
Ten of spades, four of diamonds,
Jack of clubs
Jack of hearts.
Let her go.
King of hearts.
Very appropriate.
Don't... Don't touch me.
- Don't you dare touch me.
- Come on, little fox.
Go to ground.
Leave her alone!
Get out of my sight, the lot of you.
Get out!
Get out!
Miss Forbes...
I know that it is useless to ask you to forgive my friends.
Such behaviour is beneath contempt and beyond forgiveness.
I only ask that you accept my solemn word that I knew nothing of what was going on.
How do you know my name?
The arrival in as small a village as this of a beautiful young lady and her distinguished father could scarcely go unnoticed,
Miss Forbes.
My name is Hamilton,
Clive Hamilton.
Will you kindly take me home,
Mr Hamilton?
I fear you have not forgiven me yet.
Your fears are well founded,
Mr Hamilton. I have not.
Now, will you take me home or do I have to walk?
Is there nothing I can do to persuade you of my personal innocence?
Nothing.
I take it, then, I have to walk?
My carriage is at your disposal.
Unfortunately,
I can't leave at this moment but I shall instruct one of my young guests...
- Thank you. I prefer to walk.
- Miss Forbes, you can't walk.
You might be attacked, Miss Forbes.
I've already been attacked.
And it was here in your house.
Now, please open the door.
Thank you.
And tomorrow I shall go straight to the police.
- Please don't do that, Miss Forbes.
- Why shouldn't I?
I am the Squire of this little community and responsible for the welfare of everyone in it.
Should any scandal attach to my name, the effect could be disastrous for all these people.
I can't expect you to understand why that should be.
I just ask that you believe it.
And what about those...
...your charming young guests?
Will you leave me to punish them in the way I think most fit?
I promise they'll suffer for what they've done.
Or would have done.
If it hadn't been for you.
Yes, that's true, I suppose.
Very well, Mr Hamilton.
I won't go to the police.
- This time.
- Thank you.
Are you sure you can find the way?
Thank you, Mr Hamilton.
Good night.
Please take great care not to stray from the path.
There are tin mines under this land.The ground sometimes subsides.
Denver!
Everything is ready, Master.
. Ah.
Alice.
Alice!
Good evening, Officer.
You just step up here a moment, gentlemen, please.
I... I realise this looks... it's a serious charge you'll be on in the morning.
What charge?
Who might this gentleman be?
Sir James Forbes.
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.
What are you going to charge us with?
Body snatching I should think, sir.
I see.
Well, in that case I suppose... you don't mind if we have a quick look.
I don't care who you are, sir!
Well.
What's going on, sir?
I don't know, Sergeant, any more than you do.
Now, look, Sergeant, I need your help.
My help, sir?
Say nothing of what you've seen here tonight.
Now look, Sergeant, it doesn't need me to tell you there's something very wrong in this village.
All these young men dying and now this.
Well, some people say it is the marsh fever, sir.
Oh, marsh fiddlesticks.
In any case, it couldn't cause a body to disappear into thin air, could it?
- No, sir.
- Well, then, will you help me or not?
I'd like to help you, sir. Really I would.
My boy was one of the first to go, sir.
Well, then, help me for his sake.
Very well, sir.
I'll withhold my report for 48 hours.
I dare not do more than that.
Thank you, Sergeant.
You won't regret it. I'm sure of that.
What are we going to do about this, sir?
We'll fill it in, make it look as if it's never been touched.
We can manage this on our own,
Sir James.
Why don't you wait inside where it's warm.
Thank you, Peter.
Yes, I will.
- Good night, Sergeant
- Good night, sir.
Right-ho, let's get on with it.
Sylvia?
Have you seen Alice?
She's not in her room.
Come in, Peter, and sit down.
- Sit?
- Please sit down.
I have some shocking news for you Peter.
- What is it?
- Alice.
Then she was ill.
- I must go tell her.
- Wait.
- I have to see her.
- She's not here.
- Where is she?
- Control yourself, Peter.
She's not here.
Now, listen to me.
She's outside somewhere, on the moors.
She's dead.
No.
Sylvia found her.
No.
No.
Oh, God.
Forgive me.
I killed her.
- That’s not true. You know it isn’t.
- Yes, it’s my fault.
- I should have known.
- That's nonsense, Peter.
If she's been struck by this disease, it's no fault of yours.
Take me to her, wherever she is.
Yes, I will, Peter. I will.
But there's one thing we have to do.
We must find out about the disease, find out what it is and destroy it.
You will have to let me perform an autopsy.
- God.
- We have to, Peter.
And I shall need your help.
- I'm ready, Father.
- Yes, very well.
We'll ask the sergeant to come with us.
- Hey, Martinus.
- Heh?
Come on, wake up!
Come on, let's have a word with you.
No!
Extraordinary.
- No sign of rigor mortis.
- Hm.
When did she do this?
- Some days ago.
- How?
Piece of glass, I think.
She was rather secretive about it.
- Oh?
- It was a clean wound.
Well?
It's not human.
- it's not human blood.
- Exactly.
She's been splashed with the blood of some animal.
Do you think she might have been attacked?
By an animal?
There are no external signs of violence.
None at all.
Then how did she die?
That's what we are trying to find out, Peter.
How did she die?
Stop it!
I can't stand any more.
It's not a matter of what you can or can't stand, my lad.
- it's the truth that matters, the truth.
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Look, Jack.
- Sergeant.
Sergeant.
Look, I was up there.
You saw me so it's no use my denying it.
And she... And the body was found right by me, all right.
But I didn't kill her. I didn’t kill her!
So you say, but you was drunk.
And so I'll go on saying, because it's the truth.
All right.
What was you doing up there, anyway?
I told you. I'd just had a skinful.
I don't know why I went up there.
Just to get away from everything.
Are you sure you didn't see her?
- And follow her into the woods?
- No!
You'd had a row with her husband.
There's plenty who'll swear to that.
Now, I put it to you that you wanted your revenge.
- So you saw her and followed her...
- No, I tell you, no!
- Is that the truth?
- Yeah, it is.
I'm sure of that, at least.
What do you mean by that, "at least"'?
What do you mean by it?
You wouldn't believe me, anyway.
You leave that to me to decide.
You saw something else up there, didn't you?
What was it? What was it?
My brother.
- You saw your...
- My brother, yes. The one that's dead!
The one that's buried out there.
I saw him just as clear as I see you now.
All grey, his eyes staring.
I saw him.
And yet I know he's out there, lying in his coffin.
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Peter, you'd better go up and get some rest.
You've been on your feet for 24 hours.
I can't rest. I'll just go and make all the arrangements for the funeral.
Yes?
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it, Sergeant?
The front door was open so I took the liberty...
Well, what is it?
- it's young Martinus, sir.
- What about him?
You should have a word with him.
Oh, very well.
I did see him, sir. I swear it.
Everything I told the sergeant is the truth.
I'm telling you, sir.
I did see him, sir.
I saw my brother.
Your brother is dead and buried.
I know that, sir.
Didn't I bury him myself?
But I saw him in his shroud.
- Standing, staring at me.
- How could you see him?
God only knows, sir.
But I saw him.
God only knows, indeed.
That's all, Sergeant.
You don't believe me, do you, sir?
On the contrary,
I believe everything you say.
Well, are you satisfied now, Sergeant?
No.
- You just heard the gentleman say...
- I know what the gentleman said.
But I'm the law here.
And I'm responsible for you until
I have made further investigations.
Put him in the cell, Constable.
Father.
Feeling better, my dear?
Feeling well enough to talk?
Now, when you told me about Alice, you said there was a man with her.
Did you recognise him?
No.
You remember the young man we saw who was following the funeral procession, the one who shouted at us to go away?
Yes.
- He's been arrested.
- But it wasn't him.
But you said you didn't recognise the man.
Is it possible that the man you saw was the man in the coffin?
It was, wasn't it?
But how?
Never mind how, my dear.
Just one more question and then you can rest.
When we found Alice was she in the same place where you saw her with this man?
No, no she wasn't.
It was up by some old mine works.
I don't Know exactly where.
Well, I'll try to find them.
You go back to sleep.
No, I'll be getting up in a few minutes.
Thank you, Father.
Very well.
Ah, Peter.
- How is she?
- Oh, very much better.
She's talking of getting up.
Well, I feel like a stroll.
Care to join me?
Yes.
I want a word with the sergeant so we'll call in on the way.
Where are we going, sir?
Up on the moors.
A breath of air will do us both good.
I didn't know this place even existed.
What did they mine here?
- Tin, sir.
- Tin?
Yes, there's a rich vein runs under here sir, worth a fortune.
Then why has it been allowed to fall into decay like this?
There was a lot of accidents, sir.
Miners killed and maimed.
They wouldn't go down there.
They said it was unlucky.
Old Squire was furious, but he had to shut it down.
Has young Hamilton tried to reopen it?
Oh, no, sir, but then he don't need the money.
- Where does he get his money from?
- I can't rightly say, sir.
He was away when his father died in foreign parts.
The old squire left him the house and a lot of unpaid bills.
When young Squire come back here, he shut himself up there, wouldn't see nobody.
Then suddenly he had a lot of young people down staying there and spending money like water.
It's creepy.
- They do say, sir, that it's...
- What do they say, Sergeant?
- That it's haunted?
- Well, how did you know that, sir?
It doesn't take much guessing, does it?
Come on, Peter, we mustn't leave
Sylvia alone too long.
Thank you, Sergeant.
- May I come in?
- Please.
Thank you.
What can I do for you?
At our last meeting you made it abundantly clear that my attentions would not be welcomed, that you would as soon never see me again.
I appreciate your feelings and the reason for them.
I wouldn't dream of imposing myself on you, only...
Only I felt I had to come and tell you how terribly sorry I was to hear the news of your friend,
Alice Tompson.
I knew her, you know, not very well but enough to realise what a very fine lady she was.
Please accept my sincere condolences.
Thank you, but would they not be better given to her husband?
I fear they would not be accepted,
Miss Forbes.
- Oh?
- Doctor Tompson doesn't like me.
You are not alone in your opinion of me.
I can't imagine that the opinion of others affects you very much.
Oh, I should like to be popular, of course.
I should be lying if I said otherwise.
But I realised long ago that in order to be popular one must conform.
I find that too big a price to pay.
Conform?
Well, to the standards of conduct dictated by convention.
I have my own standards.
I conform to them.
At least you are honest, Mr Hamilton.
Probably my only virtue.
I'm always honest, even with myself.
I wonder how many people can truthfully admit to that.
Not many, I agree.
I am becoming a bore.
I have taken up enough of your time.
Oh, I wonder, could I impose on you for a glass of water?
Oh, yes of course.
Unless you prefer sherry?
Please, I don't want to put you to any trouble.
It's no trouble.
Do you believe in life after death,
Miss Forbes?
- That's an odd question.
- Odd?
To ask a stranger.
I was hoping that you no longer considered me a stranger.
Very well.
Yes, I do believe in life after death.
Do you?
I'm sure of it, Miss Forbes.
I'm sorry.
- Here, let me...
- Oh!
How clumsy of me. I'm so sorry.
It's nothing, really.
This should prevent the risk of any infection.
You must think me a clumsy idiot.
I really do apologise.
One cannot be too careful.
There. Is that better?
- Thank you.
- A safety pin should hold it.
I have one in my bag.
Allow me.
May I say that I consider you to be a very brave young lady.
Because of this?
Because of everything, Miss Forbes.
I'll see myself out. it's the Master. Open.
Man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery.
He cometh up and he is cut down like a flower.
He fleeth, as it were, a shadow and never continueth in one stay.
In the midst of life we are in death.
Yet, O Lord God most holy,
O Lord God most mighty,
O holy and most merciful Saviour, deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death.
O holy and merciful Saviour,
Thou most worthy judge eternal, suffer us not at our last hour for any pains of death to fall from Thee...
...for as much as it has pleased almighty God in his great mercy to take unto Himself the soul of our dear sister here departed.
Vicar, may I ask a favour of you?
I am given to understand that you have a fine collection of books on a variety of subjects.
I wonder if you have any on witchcraft or black magic.
If so, may I have the use of your library?
- Come with me.
- Thank you.
Come in, sir.
No, no, please sit down.
Oh, hello, Peter.
Peter...
Have you ever heard of voodoo?
- it's a form of witchcraft, isn't it?
- Exactly.
It's practiced in the Caribbean, in Haiti to be precise.
Please sit down, Vicar.
I find all kinds of witchcraft slightly nauseating and this I find absolutely disgusting.
You're not following and there's no reason why you should if I don't explain properly.
- Unless you would like to...
- No, I'm ignorant in these matters.
Oh, well.
Sylvia tells us that she saw something on the moors, something that was a man and yet not a man.
Her description was of a walking corpse, the corpse of Martinus' brother.
Now...
...young Martinus also says that he saw something on the moor, something that he insists was his brother.
But we know that his brother is dead.
We also know that he is not lying in his coffin.
Now, what do you make of that?
That he was buried alive, that he somehow freed himself and he's out there.
But I've told you, Peter, I saw him.
And he was as dead then as any corpse I have ever seen.
No, that's not the answer.
Then, what is?
What is the connection with voodoo?
Someone in this village is practicing witchcraft.
That corpse wandering on the moors is...
...an undead, a zombie.
It's incredible, sir.
How can you, a man of science, believe that?
I have an advantage over you there, Peter.
I spent the afternoon reading up the subject in the vicar's library.
And it's all there.
It's all clearly scientifically stated.
And we have the evidence of two sensible human beings.
What can be done?
About Martinus' brother? Nothing.
I'm thinking of Alice.
- Are you saying that Alice is...?
- Peter, I am.
I pray that I'm wrong.
But I’m going to watch over her grave tonight with the vicar until daybreak.
I'll come, too.
I’d rather you didn’t.
I think you need some rest.,
- I am rested, sir.
- Well, I'm...
If anything were to happen,
I'd rather you weren't there.
I'm coming with you.
Very well.
- Vicar?
- What?
I think you should go home now. it's very late.
Dr Tompson and I will stay on.
- If you're sure.
- Yes, yes. Quite sure.
All right.
- Good night, Sir James.
- Good night.
What happened?
- Who attacked you?
- I don't know.
He wore a mask.
We'll take you home.
I shall be all right now, thank you.
If you should need me...
Don't worry.
We won't hesitate to call you.
Thank you, Sir James.
We must get back.
This may have been a trick.
Zombie.
- Oh.
- Peter?
Peter, it's all right. it's all right now.
You had a nightmare.
A nightmare?
Then, it wasn't Alice?
I'm afraid that part of it was true.
You fainted and we brought you back here.
And Alice?
Reburied properly.
The vicar gave her absolution.
She will be at peace now.
Peace? Is there such a thing?
There will be, my son, and with God's help and the energy of your good friend,
I am sure of it.
Well, I must get back to my church now.
Thank you for your help, Vicar.
It is I who should be thanking you.
I shall pray for you both.
Would you care to tell me about your dream?
It sometimes helps.
I dreamed I saw the dead rise.
All the graves in the churchyard opened and the dead came out.
All the graves were empty.
In heaven's name, where are they?
What's happened to them, sir?
It is essential that none of the villagers should know of this.
We must get these graves filled in before anyone is astir.
Very good, sir.
Sergeant, I want another word with your prisoner, young Martinus.
- You want to see him right away, sir?
- Yes, immediately.
He's got away, Sergeant!
Anyone can see that.
The question is how?
The question is, where did he go?
Has he joined the others?
- The others?
- You know what I mean.
But he's not dead, sir.
Not yet, Sergeant.
But he soon will be.
Did the prisoner have any visitors yesterday?
- Well, did he?
- Er... No, sir.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
Well, only the squire, that is.
- What did he want?
- He wanted a word with the prisoner.
I didn't think there was anything wrong.
- What did they talk about?
- Oh, I didn't listen, sir.
I didn't think it would be right.
They just talked? Nothing else?
- No, nothing, sir.
- Are you sure?
Well, of course I'm sure, sir.
They just talked.
Oh, the Squire asked for a glass of water.
For the prisoner.
He said he was thirsty so I got him one.
Where is it?
- The water?
- The glass!
I threw it away, sir. It got broken.
- Who broke it? You?
- No, the Squire.
And young Martinus out himself?
How did you know that?
Never mind.
Sylvia.
Sylvia?
- Yes, Father. Whats the matter?
- Oh, there you are.
Oh, nothing, I...
I was just getting a little worried about you.
Why? I'm all right now.
I'm just clearing up.
- How's the finger?
- Fine, thank you. Almost healed.
I must get on.
Ah, Peter. I have to go out again.
I want you to do something for me.
Don't let Sylvia out of your sight until I tell you it is safe to do so.
- But, sir...
- Please.
Believe me when I say she is in danger.
- What can I do for you?
- We have met before, young man, in somewhat disturbing circumstances.
However, I shall not hold that against you.
Is Mr Hamilton in?
He's in but he's busy.
Good. Will you tell him that I want to see him?
I've told you, he is busy.
I'm glad to hear it.
I, too, am a busy man.
But as I have found the time to come all the way out to see him
I think that he could come out to see me.
Would you tell him that, please?
Well?
Yes, thank you.
- Are you being funny?
- No, I'm not being funny.
I'm just trying to remember my manners.
I wish I could say the same for you.
My name is Forbes.
Yours is Hamilton, I believe.
What do you want?
I want to talk to you, Mr Hamilton.
In private.
Get out.
What do you want to see me about?
About Alice Tompson.
About young Martin us.
- About my daughter, Mr Hamilton.
- What about them?
And about many others who should be at rest now, at rest in their graves.
- What has happened to them?
- How should I know?
I don't know how but you do know.
You know very well what has happened to them.
Are you mad?
I almost wish I was.
This business is so appalling.
Mr Hamilton...
Am I right in thinking that you have spent a large part of your life in the Caribbean, in Haiti, to be precise?
And while you where there, did you learn something of the practice of voodoo?
You are mad!
No, I'm not.
But can the same be said of you?
Get out of here!
- I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.
Good night, Mr Hamilton.
Well, I'm ready.
Kada nostra. Kada estra.
Kada nostra.
Kada estra.
- Kada nostra.
- What was that?
Nothing, Peter.
Come to me.
You will come to me.
- What is it?
- Some water, please.
Come and sit down.
Sylvia?
Aargh!
Help! Help!
- Hamilton, where is he?
- I don't Know.
- Where is he? Where is he?
- I don't know.
- Do you want to burn to death?
- No, no, no!
- Where is he?
- He's in the mine.
Get to the mineshaft, all of you!
Peter, look out! Peter!
Ohh!
Hurry!
Ah! Let me out!
The more adventurous among you... may remember our previous excursions into the macabre.
Our visits to haunted hills... to tinglers and to ghosts.
This time we have even a stranger tale to unfold.
Blood.
The story of a lovable group of people... who just happen to be homicidal.
No, Warren, it's mine!
How do you do?
I'd like a room with bath, please.
- Not on the street side.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Double or twins?
- Double.
For how long, miss?
Until September 6.
Would $5 a day be about right?
Is that the best you have?
We have a suite for $7.50, but we usually rent that to couples.
I'll take the double.
Number 17, Mrs. Webster.
Miss Webster.
Miss Webster.
Eddie.
No.
You.
I sort of do everything around here.
I say they ought to leave the windows open in here... so it won't be so stuffy, but they don't.
Are you married?
Married? No.
But that doesn't mean it hasn't crossed my mind.
I want some ice, please.
And maybe some glasses, too?
Just some ice.
In a flash.
Come in.
What's your name?
Jim. Jim Nesbitt.
Mine's Miriam Webster.
I know. I looked at the register.
If that's not enough, I can get some more.
There's a tip for you.
Did you know this was $100?
For a bucket of ice?
More than that.
Count it.
$2,000 altogether. Yours.
- Who do I have to murder?
- No one.
What do I have to do?
Marry me. On September 6.
Wow.
That wouldn't be so hard to take, even without this.
Very well.
One other thing.
The marriage will be annulled... immediately after the ceremony.
Annulled? You mean...
- Well, we don't have to be in too big of a...
- Do you understand that?
I understand what you're saying, but I don't understand why.
You don't have to understand.
You'll call for me at midnight on the 6th.
What kind of a deal is this?
Okay, Miriam.
What have I got to lose?
Not much.
All set for the happy event?
"Alfred S. Adrims.
1623 West Third Street."
- Do you know where that is?
- Sure.
But why way out there?
Because that's where we're going.
How are you going to get us annulled this time of night?
This is the strangest thing
I've ever been through.
- You gonna leave the keys in it?
- Who'd steal that heap?
No lights, huh?
- What do you want this time of night?
- We want to get married.
- Too late. Come back in the morning.
- Oh, please.
We've driven so far, and we have so far to go.
We'll pay. Extra.
- You sure you got the money?
- Yes.
Come on in. I'll see if he'll do it.
Wait here.
I never thought I'd get married in a dump like this.
Why can't you wait till a decent time to get married?
Once you do, you'll find there's time aplenty.
And more.
We're sorry. Aren't we, darling?
You will, won't you?
Well, this time of night, it's gonna cost you.
- Are you Alfred S. Adrims?
- Well, yeah.
Pay in advance.
And $2 extra for the music.
- It'll disturb the neighbours.
- Then play soft!
Well, let's begin.
You two stand over there.
- Where's my book, Martha?
- Where you left it last.
Let me see your papers.
You Webster? You Nesbitt?
You can stop now.
You take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
I guess so.
- Say "I do."
- I do.
You take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
I do.
Ain't you got no ring?
On her.
Take your glove off, so he can get the ring.
By the power vested in me by the State of California...
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Congratulations.
Now I get to kiss the little lady.
Get the police!
Get a doctor!
Get the police!
We interrupt this program to bring you a police bulletin.
Justice of the Peace Adrims was murdered in his home in Ventura tonight...
by a young woman whose description follows:
About 5'6", blonde, about 20 years old.
She is dressed in a beige coat, no hat...
and is believed to be driving a 1953 Chevrolet...
license IMR 1405.
Anyone knowing anything about this woman is asked to call the police.
Approach her with extreme caution as she is considered to be homicidal.
You should be asleep, Helga. It's late.
What's the matter, dear?
Is there something wrong?
Were you afraid, being in the house all alone?
What are you trying to tell me?
That you missed me?
That you're glad I'm back?
You shouldn't do that, dear.
It's very impolite.
Especially since I have something to tell you.
Adrims died tonight.
<b>Screaming!</b>
Good morning, Helga.
Did you have a nice rest?
No bad dreams, I hope.
Helga, what's the matter with you?
I only wanted to take you to the table.
You're very nervous this morning, darling.
Here's your milk.
Drink it.
You must, dear. It's good for you.
Helga, you are making me very angry.
Why are you doing that?
I know what you want.
You want me to taste it.
You think maybe I put something in it?
It's delicious.
Have some.
There. Now isn't that better?
You know, you've been very cross with me lately, Helga.
You shouldn't be angry with me.
I like you.
Would I let Warren bring me here, all the way from Denmark, if I didn't?
I think you're afraid of me, Helga.
You wouldn't want me to go away, would you? Leave you all alone?
Who would feed you, put you to bed?
You'd dry up.
You would dry up and die!
It's Miriam Webster.
She's brought you some flowers.
- Good morning, Emily.
- Good morning, Miriam.
Hello, Helga. How are you today?
I brought you some flowers.
She looks tired.
Well, she didn't sleep too well last night. She has dreams.
Warren should be here today.
That should cheer you up.
- This is his day to visit, isn't it?
- Of course. Every Thursday.
You should know that by now.
I mean, you always manage to drop by when Warren's here.
- Well, he's my brother.
- He's your half-brother.
Yes.
I don't get a chance to talk to Warren now that he's working in San Diego.
Well, I guess we're not as important as Warren.
You never come up to visit us.
Of course I do. I was here last weekend.
I forgot. You must have been feeling very generous.
Don't be silly, Emily.
You know I'm very fond of you and Helga.
But you like Warren more, don't you?
Is that why you've taken such an interest in him lately?
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.
How's the flower shop?
Fine. I'm thinking of opening another one in Santa Maria.
That'll take a lot of money.
Yes, I suppose it will.
Warren bought the flower shop, didn't he?
- Yes.
- Then you have no problem.
He'll buy you another one.
I can pay for it myself.
But with Warren coming into all that money...
I'm sure he'll want you to have some.
- Emily, I...
- Helga, look.
Wasn't that nice of Miriam?
Aren't they pretty?
I'll put them in your room for you.
I'm sorry. I think I interrupted you.
It wasn't anything.
I was wondering if I could ask you a favour.
Well, of course. What is it?
I have to go into Solvang for a prescription for Helga.
Would you stay with her?
- Is something wrong, Helga?
- She doesn't want to me leave.
But I have to, dear.
You know how important this prescription is.
Karl could fix it up in no time.
Would you stay until Warren gets here?
Karl and I were thinking of going on a picnic. It's such a lovely day.
You can go this afternoon.
I wouldn't ask you, Miriam, but she needs the medicine.
Why, yes, of course.
And that will give me a chance to talk with Warren.
Thanks, Miriam.
And Helga thanks you, too.
- What does she want?
- She's just saying goodbye.
I think it's wonderful the way you understand what she's saying.
We know each other very well, don't we, Helga?
I want to see if I have the prescription.
Yes, here it is.
I know you'll miss me, dear.
I'll miss you, too.
Bye.
- Hi, Emily.
- Hello, Karl.
There you are, Johnny. If you need any help with that, just let me know.
Boy, what a great day outside.
How are you, Emily?
Emily, how are you?
- Fine.
- How's Helga getting along?
About the same. I have a prescription.
A professional call, huh?
All right, come on over to drugs.
Well, let's have it.
- Say, this is dangerous stuff.
- Is it?
Sure. That's strychnine, see?
I'll have to be very careful when I give it to her.
This won't take me but a couple of minutes to fix. You want to wait?
Fine.
You know, Miriam and I have the whole day planned out.
We're going to pack a picnic lunch and head for the woods.
Be a shame to waste such a nice day.
Karl, I'm sorry.
I forgot to tell you about Miriam.
- What's that?
- She can't make it today.
Why?
Something's come up, and she's got to talk to Warren.
- Disappointed?
- Well, sure I am.
I was looking forward to this.
Can I take her place?
Well, thanks anyway, Emily, but I might as well stay here.
I've got work to do, anyway.
Karl, Miriam wants you to pick her up tonight at the flower shop when you close.
I'll never understand women.
They're planning something new every minute.
- Howdy, Karl.
- Howdy.
Think you can fill this for me in a hurry?
Just as soon as I'm finished with this one, Dr. Jonas.
I guess I can wait a couple of minutes.
Always telling everybody else to slow down.
Aren't you Emily, up at Helga's place?
That's right.
Yeah. I've been meaning to go up to see her for a long time.
Never seem to have the time.
- How is old Helga?
- She's just fine.
Yeah? And I'm glad to hear it.
You know, she's a strange woman, that Helga.
She was my nurse when I had my office in Ventura.
- That was years ago.
- I didn't know that, Doc.
Yeah, sure. There you are.
As a matter of fact, she was the one that delivered Warren.
I thought you did.
What's the matter, Doc?
Dereliction of duty?
No. I was sick at the time.
No, Helga delivered him and then she quit me cold.
It was a funny thing.
Maybe she thought you were upset with her.
Maybe.
She was good friends with Warren's mother.
They were all hoping for a boy, and pleased as punch when they got one.
I wish I'd known Warren when he was younger.
Yeah. Nice fellow.
Shame when his parents died.
Helga brought him up.
Took him back to Denmark with her.
Isn't that where Warren met you, Emily?
Yes. When Helga had her stroke, he asked me to come back and take care of her.
He's been home about a year, hasn't he?
My goodness. Time certainly flies.
Seems like only a month or two.
Here you are, Emily.
- How much do I owe you?
- I'll just put it on the bill.
Thank you.
You sure you don't want to change your mind about the picnic?
No, thanks. I think I'd better stay here.
What's this now? Are you turning down a nice young girl, Karl?
You're making a mistake.
Always try to keep my eye on the couples in town. Good for business.
I didn't know you and Karl had a thing going.
We don't.
Maybe you and Warren then.
So that's it, huh?
He's a good prospect, coming into all that money.
You'd be rich.
I have to get back to Helga's. Bye.
Say hello to her for me.
Tell her I'll be in to see her one of these days.
Unusual girl, Karl.
Good looking, too. You're missing a bet.
I wonder.
Miriam?
Anybody here?
Karl, wake up.
Come on, Karl, snap out of it.
Oh, brother.
It feels like I've got two heads and both of them are killing me.
You all right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Warren, what are you doing here?
I was just driving up to Helga's.
I thought I'd stop by and see Miriam first.
What happened?
Who made the mess in the shop?
That's what I'd like to know.
Stopped by to see your sister.
- Where is Miriam? Did you see her?
- No. I just got in from San Diego.
She's probably up at the house.
- Do you have your wallet?
- Yeah.
Thought it might have been a robbery.
More like malicious damage. Look.
Somebody doesn't like you.
Seems that way.
What kind of a mind would do something like this?
More like an animal than a human being.
- Karl.
- Yeah.
You seen this?
- I read it this morning.
- Look at the drawing.
So?
I stopped for gas and saw the papers in the rack.
The picture gave me a start.
Just my imagination, I guess.
Well, this isn't. Somebody was in here.
Think I'd better get back up to the house and see if Miriam's all right.
- Yes?
- Whoever was in here might come back.
Why doesn't Miriam spend the night with you, up at the house?
- Do you really think she's in danger?
- Why take chances?
And don't tell her what happened.
There's no sense in getting her upset.
I'll stay and clean up.
And be careful yourself.
Remember, somebody smashed your photograph.
Miriam? Emily?
Hello, Warren.
- Are you all right?
- Of course. Why?
Where's Emily and Helga?
I finally put Helga to bed.
And as for Emily, I haven't seen her all day.
Warren, you're going to have to do something about her.
- What do you mean?
- She deliberately lied to me.
She said she was going to get a prescription filled for Helga and come right back.
- But she never showed up.
- I guess she took the day off.
- Yes, I guess she did.
- I'll talk to her about it.
- What do you really know about her?
- What do we really know about anybody?
Well, I don't like her, and I don't think Helga does, either.
Look, Miriam, they've been together for years. Helga needs her.
Besides, you're probably just angry because of today.
Probably.
Can you blame her for taking off once a while?
She's cooped up here all week. She gets lonely, likes to take a drive now and then.
- I guess you're right.
- What were you doing in the playroom?
Revisiting the past?
So long since I've been in here.
I don't know whether I like it or not.
Why?
Things it reminds me of.
Helga would never let me in here.
She was always trying to keep us away from each other.
That was part of the system.
Toughen me up, keep girls out of my life.
Make me more of a man.
All because of my father.
- I hardly even remember him.
- I do.
I remember everything he did to make me as hard and ruthless as he was.
Do you know that he even paid Karl to start fights with me when we were kids?
I used to watch the two of you hitting each other.
And I'd look at Father.
He'd be smiling.
Remember this?
Helga would come in here with this, all to make me strong.
I'd learn to count on my back.
I don't think I'll ever forgive Helga for that.
She was only obeying orders.
Father's orders.
Why don't we forget about it?
Can you?
Can you forget what he did to your mother?
He threw her over when you were born just because he wanted a son.
I know.
Then he married my mother and he got the boy he wanted.
Too bad he only had a few years left to enjoy me.
Then the night he and mother went to the party and got drunk.
They got in their car and started speeding and smashed into a wall.
- Warren, please.
- I'm sorry. That was a long time ago.
I shouldn't talk about it.
Besides, I should be thanking Dad right now.
In two days, I'll be 21... and that means I'll be coming into roughly $10 million.
- And that's a lot of money.
- That's a cheap price for being his son.
Well, making money was the only thing he knew how to do.
I'm glad you're not like him.
You know, if I die before my birthday, you get all the loot.
What would you do with it?
Give it away. So stay alive.
Warren, do you remember the only argument we ever had?
It was over this.
How you howled when I swiped it from you.
And you never gave it back to me, either.
Keep it. Take it home with you.
That reminds me.
I'd better be getting back.
Spend the night here and then we can have breakfast in the morning.
All right. I'm a little tired for driving, anyway.
The bed's made up. I'll leave a note for Emily and she can wake us both early.
Don't bother. I'm a light sleeper.
Happy birthday, Warren... two days in advance.
Good night.
Emily, what're you doing in my room?
Emily, what do you want?
If you don't get out of here,
I'm going to call Warren.
Do you hear me?
Warren, darling, I'm back.
Did you miss me?
I worry about you, Emily.
Good morning, Miriam. Is Warren up?
I don't know.
Well, I'm cooking his breakfast now.
He asked me to wake him.
Emily, what were you doing in my room last night?
Your room? I don't understand.
You were in my room last night.
In the middle of the night. I saw you.
- Well, you must have been dreaming.
- I wasn't dreaming, Emily.
I got up to close the window and you were standing there.
You're just like Helga.
Both of you keep having nightmares.
What about yesterday?
Was that a nightmare?
You left the house and never came back.
I did, didn't I?
I apologise, Miriam.
I just decided I wanted to take a drive.
And did you just decide that you wanted to come into my room?
You better see a doctor, dear.
You're imagining things.
Look, Emily, I've had just about enough of this.
I'm going to talk to Warren and we can get somebody else to take care of Helga.
No, you can't.
- Where are you going?
- To see Warren.
- Not until he's had his breakfast.
- I'll take it to him.
No, it's my duty. I'm his wife.
- I don't believe you.
- Ask him.
- I will.
- Miriam... if you stay in this house one more minute, I'm going to kill you.
- Miss Miriam Webster?
- Yes?
My name is Lieutenant Miller,
Ventura Plainclothes Division.
I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.
- Why? Is someone in trouble?
- No, miss. Just routine.
Mind telling me where you were the night before last?
The night before last?
I was at a movie.
- Alone?
- No. With a friend.
The name, please.
Karl Anderson.
He owns the drugstore at the corner.
Why are you asking me all these questions?
Will you excuse me a minute, miss?
Are you sure that's not the one?
Nope. That's not her.
Okay. Thanks.
- I'm sorry to trouble you, miss.
- Wait a minute.
What's this all about?
Well, we had a murder down in Ventura the other day.
A girl killed a Justice of the Peace.
- What has that got to do with me?
- She used the name Miriam Webster.
- What?
- Probably just a coincidence.
Lots of Miriam Websters in Southern California.
Here's my card, miss.
In case you find out anyone's been using your name. Give me a call.
- Hello, Karl.
- Hi.
Did that police car just pull away from here?
- Yes.
- What did they want?
A Justice of the Peace was murdered in Ventura.
I know. I read it in the paper.
Yeah, well, that's what they wanted.
So what's that got to do with you?
The girl who killed him used my name.
The detective asked me to call him if I found out anything.
- The police don't think you had anything...
- I don't know what they think, Karl.
I'm sorry.
It's just that so much is happening that I don't understand.
Last night Emily came into my room.
- What for?
- I don't know.
When I asked her about it this morning, she denied it, said I was dreaming.
And then she threatened to kill me unless I left the house.
Where was Emily yesterday afternoon?
She said she was out driving. Why?
Someone was in here yesterday while you were gone.
A wedding wreath was destroyed and Warren's picture was smashed.
Who would do such a thing?
I cleaned up here last night and found this.
That's the prescription I filled for Emily yesterday.
And whoever was in here last night dropped it.
Emily.
I'm going to call the police.
No.
Why?
Warren and Emily are married.
Married? I don't believe it.
Well, that's what she told me.
I don't know whether it's true or not.
Well, we're going to find out.
The police are still seeking the woman who murdered Alfred S. Adrims...
Justice of the Peace, in Ventura.
The cold-blooded murder occurred September 6.
A woman giving the name of Miriam Webster...
disappeared right after the killing.
Captain Dawson of the Ventura police stated this morning...
they have a lead and is confident of the apprehension of the homicidal maniac.
You remember Adrims, don't you, Helga?
When I was a kid, he used to come up here.
You gave him money.
He used to give me a quarter and say it was my share for being a good little boy.
I never liked him.
Why did you give him money, Helga?
I forgot you can't answer, can you?
You sorry we came back from Denmark?
This place hold unpleasant memories for you?
Do you want to go back?
Maybe you will someday.
You always wanted me to get my father's money, didn't you?
You made sure of it.
That's why we're here, isn't it?
Well, one more day.
We'll have a birthday party.
You, Emily and me.
It's Miriam and Karl.
- Hello, Warren.
- Miriam, Karl.
Why did you leave so early this morning?
I thought we were having breakfast together.
- Well, I had to...
- Emily's upstairs. I'll get her.
Just a minute, Warren.
We'd like to talk to you alone.
Why? What's the matter?
- Are you and Emily married?
- Who told you that?
She did.
We were married in Denmark.
We were going to keep it a secret awhile.
She doesn't think you like her, won't accept her.
You know Emily threatened to kill Miriam this morning?
I don't believe that.
I'm going to get Emily.
- Warren.
- Yes?
We think that Emily murdered Alfred Adrims.
That's a rotten, filthy thing to say, Karl.
Miriam, is that what you think?
I don't know, Warren.
Please listen to Karl.
I filled a prescription for Emily yesterday.
I found the bottle last night in Miriam's shop. How did it get there?
Somebody else could have put it there.
You saw that shop last night, Warren.
The wedding wreath was destroyed by whoever was in there.
And that little toy groom was ripped apart.
A similar pattern as the knifing of Adrims in Ventura.
The drawing of the girl in the newspaper looked like Emily.
A lot of women look like that.
Would a lot of women use the name Miriam Webster?
There must be some explanation.
- Do you have a photograph of Emily?
- Why?
If she's innocent, it'll be simple to prove.
I think so.
This isn't very good.
I took it just after we were married.
I'll drive down to Ventura tonight after I close up.
- Let me go with you.
- No. I'd rather go alone.
Please, darling, it's better that way.
Then we'll know for sure.
That's right. Then you'll both know how wrong you are.
I hope he's right.
Goodbye, Helga.
Bye, Helga.
You closing early, Karl?
Yeah, I'm driving to Ventura, Doc.
I hate to bother you, but I need some sleeping pills for a patient.
It won't take you a minute.
Sure. A couple of minutes won't make any difference.
If you need anything else, Doc.
The store might be closed tomorrow.
- Any trouble, Karl?
- Well, I don't know.
It was a brutal murder, wasn't it?
Always shocks me to read something like that.
But nowadays people seem to hate more.
Is there any way to tell?
- What? Tell what, Karl?
- Well, if a person's homicidal.
There you are.
No. That's what makes them so dangerous.
They can change from being your friend into your murderer in a second's time.
- Anyone in mind, Karl?
- Just asking.
We all hate to a certain extent.
You'd be surprised at the murderous daydreams... that some sweet old ladies indulge in.
But it's only when hate is dammed up that it breaks out in murder.
Try to imagine an infant... enraged over some slight frustration... like having his toy taken away.
Then think of him with the strength and imagination of an adult.
He would kill.
In some ways, the person with homicidal tendencies... has never developed emotionally beyond that point.
In other words then, Doc... anybody could kill that didn't have an outlet for their hate.
You must have somebody in mind, Karl.
Who is it?
Thanks, Karl. Sorry to have bothered you.
That's all right, Doc.
Thank you very much.
Hi. Are you ready to leave?
I'd feel a lot better if you came with me.
Darling, we've discussed that. I'd rather not.
- Why?
- I just can't.
Warren's my brother and I don't want to be there.
You go on without me. I'll be all right.
Look, don't go out.
And after I leave, close up and lock the doors.
Stop worrying about me.
Warren might have told Emily of our suspicions.
If we're right, she might come after you.
Look, when you hear something, you'll phone, won't you?
Yeah, sure.
Good. Now, stop worrying. Go on.
Lock the door.
Howdy.
What took you so long?
I called you this morning.
Everybody's in a hurry.
For 20 years a knife stays dull, and in 20 minutes it's got to be sharp.
How much for this?
- What kind of knife is this?
- How much?
Well, it's a long trip out here. $2.
I'll tell you what.
I'll sharpen every knife you got in your house for $3.
Just this.
- You'd save money.
- I said just this.
What kind of knife you said this was?
Never saw one before.
It's a surgical knife.
Doctors use it.
What do you use it for?
Various things.
There you are.
Sharp enough to whittle wood.
Anything else I can do?
Be careful with that, young lady!
You may cut yourself!
It's always so lonely when Warren leaves.
Isn't it?
It's too bright in here.
Don't you think so, Helga?
What we want is quiet.
No one to disturb us.
It's a pity you talk too much, Helga.
Before, you couldn't talk at all.
Well, at least you won't scream... the way Warren did when he was a little boy.
Out here in the woods no one could hear him scream! Could they?
I never liked your eyes, Helga.
They see too much.
- Afternoon, Emily.
- Dr. Jonas.
This is quite a surprise.
I'm on my way to a house call nearby... so I thought I'd make up for lost time and pay Helga a visit.
- Where is she?
- In there.
Yes.
Hello, Helga. My, it's been many years.
I was sorry to hear about your illness.
You don't look bad, though.
Probably outlive all of us.
I've been meaning to visit you for a whole year... ever since you got back from Denmark.
But with one thing and another...
Anyway, I'm here now, for what it's worth.
Tell you one thing, Helga... you've done a good job raising Warren.
He's a fine young fellow.
You should be very proud.
My, you do a lot of reading, Emily.
Books, magazines.
Dr. Jonas, you'll lose my place.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm a sucker for murder mysteries, myself.
Chew them up by the carload.
How about you, Emily?
You go in for that kind?
No. They don't interest me.
- No. Love stories, I guess.
- Once in a while.
I imagine it gets kind of lonely out here.
Reading probably helps pass the time.
Trouble is, you read too much, you get headaches.
Bothered much by headaches, Emily?
I'm sorry, Dr. Jonas, but it's time for Helga's nap.
She hasn't been too well lately, and she needs her rest.
Yes, of course.
Well, it's time for me to leave anyhow.
You get plenty of rest, Helga, and do just what Emily tells you.
And I'll be in to see you again real soon.
Helga will like that. Won't you, dear?
And now we'll go upstairs.
You need your rest.
Something you're trying to say, Helga?
Anything I can do?
She doesn't want you to leave, Doctor.
Your visit excited her.
Yes, of course.
Well, next time I'll stay longer.
That's a promise.
Emily.
Yes?
Your telephone. It's off the hook.
I always do that when Helga takes her nap.
The ringing bothers her.
Something you want, Doctor?
No, I guess not.
Helga!
Now!
Mrs. Adrims left for New York this morning.
The jeweller who sold Miriam Webster the wedding ring is on a fishing trip.
So, that leaves only one witness... the bellboy, to identify the photograph you have.
We'll see him right now.
Jim Nesbitt. Where is he?
He doesn't come on until 8:00.
- Where does he live?
- A rooming house on Fourth Street.
We'll wait.
- Has Jim done anything wrong?
- Not lately.
Say, do you have a telephone here that I could use?
- Yes, sir. Right there.
- Thank you.
Long distance, please.
I'd like to call Solvang, California.
The number is Solvang 499.
Yes?
Yes, Karl, I'm all right.
The Ventura Hotel.
All right, dear.
Hello, Warren.
Have you heard anything yet?
Karl just phoned.
They're waiting at the hotel for Jim Nesbitt.
- When will he be there?
- About 8:00.
I shouldn't have let Karl go.
Do you think Emily is a cold-blooded murderess?
Miriam, answer me.
I don't know, Warren.
Should've never let him have her photograph.
It's better to know for sure, isn't it?
Karl?
Yes.
All right.
Jim Nesbitt positively identified Emily... as the killer of Alfred Adrims.
My God.
The police are leaving Ventura now.
They'll be here as soon as they can.
Helga's all alone in the house with Emily.
I've got to get there right away.
But Karl said to wait here for them.
It'll take them over an hour.
I've got to leave now.
- I'll go with you.
- I don't want to take any chances.
- You're not going there alone.
- Will you listen to me, please?
Warren, I'm going with you.
You wait in the car.
I don't want you to go inside.
Warren, please don't go in there.
- I can take care of myself.
- Please let me go with you.
It'll be safer here, Miriam.
Wait in the car.
This is the fright break.
Do you hear that sound?
It's the sound of a heartbeat.
A frightened, terrified heart.
Is it beating faster than your heart or slower?
This heart is going to beat for another 25 seconds...
to allow anyone to leave this theatre...
who is too frightened to see the end of the picture.
Ten seconds more and we go into the house.
It's now or never.
Five, four. You're a brave audience.
Two, one.
Warren?
Helga!
Emily, it's you!
Warren!
I'm right here, Miriam.
Know me?
Now?
Warren.
Of course. I've always been Warren.
When the police get here, they'll find that Emily has murdered you.
I tried to stop her.
She attacked me. She tried to kill me.
Emily was hopelessly insane.
She escaped.
The police will search for her but they won't find her.
She's gone... for good.
When I left Helga's, I was concerned.
So I decided to stop by on my way home.
Warren must have been completely insane.
Warren was playing for high stakes... the fortune left by his father to his son.
The masquerade was apparently started by Warren's mother at birth... and continued by Helga... and later by Warren himself.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
The entire estate of Warren's father was to go to his son... on his 21st birthday.
Providing there was a son.
Otherwise, the estate would revert to Miriam Webster... his oldest daughter by a former marriage.
The will was signed in Ventura,
California.
This is the birth certificate of Warren Webster... born three months after the will was signed.
The sex was entered as male.
It was recorded and signed by Alfred Adrims... county clerk, Ventura.
Helga Swenson actually delivered a girl.
She and Adrims must have been paid handsomely by Warren's mother... to falsify the records and keep up the deception.
Warren's parents died a few years later.
The father went to his death thinking he had a son.
Then Helga took Warren to Denmark.
What happened there we don't know.
But last year, Helga had a stroke... and Warren returned to the States with her.
In order for Warren to continue the masquerade successfully... he had to get rid of three people.
The two who knew of the deception:
Alfred Adrims, who had become a Justice of the Peace... and Helga, who had become a burden to him.
And then Miriam... the real heiress to the estate.
And so, Warren created Emily... a homicidal maniac who did his killing for him.
Well, that's just about it.
I won't keep you any longer.
You're now a very rich young woman,
Miss Webster. Good luck.
Thank you.
Karl, now that I'm rich, it won't make any difference, will it?
Yes, it will, Miriam.
I think I'm going to love you more.
You'll never win, you'll always lose.
And you sympathize.
Of all the newsworthy stories around London,
I gotta get stuck with
The Great Vorelli.
Well, he must have something.
Yeah, well, we'll soon find out.
You got that expert on mesmerism all set, that Dr. Heller?
Oh, I spoke to him earlier.
He said he'd find his own way to the theater tonight.
He doesn't want to see you.
He said he couldn't bear to meet a journalist in the evening, but he'll come by the office tomorrow morning at 10:30 to give you his opinion of Mr.
Vorelli.
He's a bit independent, is he?
Does he know we're paying him for his services?
I don't think he's the least bit interested in the money.
Yeah, but these retired experts, they don't care about the money, so they tell you.
Well, make a note so
I won't forget to be available for Mr. Heller at 10:30 tomorrow.
And what else?
What about the girl who's gonna volunteer?
Oh, I'm sorry, Mark.
I forgot to tell you, the one we picked, she won't do it.
She's afraid.
Afraid of what?
She's afraid of Vorelli doing things to her mind.
We'll go get someone else.
It will be difficult on such short notice.
Yeah.
Hello, can I speak to Marianne, please?
Hello, hello, Marianne?
How are you?
Yeah, Marianne, how'd you like to go to the theater tonight?
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to suggest to this man that is life is in danger, that he may die at any moment.
Mr. Harrison, look into my eyes.
Mr. Harrison, you told me that in China you once saw a man executed in the streets.
I want you to imagine that you are in his place, that you are on your knees.
On your knees.
You're about to be executed by a soldier, who'll put a single bullet through the back of your head.
You're alone.
You look up and see the faces of the crowd.
In moments they will move away, leaving you dead on the pavement.
You turn, and see the soldier standing behind you.
His face grim, his gun ready for firing.
You are moments from death.
You await the sound of the gun and the pain of a bullet crashing into your head.
You wait for the sound of the gun, and the pain of the bullet smashing into your head.
Now ladies and gentlemen, I should like another volunteer.
Anyone?
Perhaps the young lady in the seventh row?
Anyone at all?
Go on.
Mark, I really don't, I don't think so.
Come on, you promised.
Oh, all right.
Well, this is very kind of you.
But do you mind telling me your name?
Marianne Horn.
Are you frightened, Ms. Horn?
No, I don't think so.
Are you by any chance a professional entertainer?
No, no.
I didn't think so.
You seem like a very shy girl.
Well Ms. Horn, do you dance?
Well, everyone does.
Ballet?
Well no, not since a few lessons as a child.
I see.
Now Ms. Horn, don't be frightened.
Just look into my eyes.
That's right.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have with us tonight an expert on modern dancing.
He will dance with Ms. Horn, and I guarantee you that she will dance as well with the expert.
Ms. Horn, in a few moments you'll be hearing some music.
When the music begins, you will become a dancer.
You are again Ms. Marianne Horn.
What a magnificent dancer has been lost.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your very kind attention.
Magda, if you please.
What happened to you?
I don't know.
Where'd you learn to dance like that?
Mark, I don't know.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I should like to introduce my esteemed collaborator, Hugo.
Now to look at him, you might think he was just another ordinary ventriloquist dummy.
Indeed he is, but he has unexpected talents.
Well Hugo, what are you going to do to amuse the audience tonight?
Anything you say, my dear Vorelli.
Except that kind of thing.
Why, what do you mean by that?
Simply that you are laughing while I am talking.
Well, what's wrong with that?
Oh, it's an old ventriloquist trick.
They're all doing it now, it's corny.
Perhaps we can show the audience a variation on the theme.
Give me some wine.
I want some wine.
A dummy, drinking wine?
Don't be ridiculous.
I want some.
Give it to me, I know what wine is.
I've had wine before.
I want some wine, why shouldn't I have some wine?
You are a dummy, Hugo.
Now, was that so corny?
Listen to the audience applaud.
They're not applauding you, they're applauding me.
Yes, me, Hugo the dummy.
Well, if it's for you, you must go and thank the audience, mustn't you?
Go to the footlights and thank them.
You must obey me.
Hugo, walk to the footlights and thank them.
Thank you.
Now return to your master.
Do you know who that girl was?
The one you were seducing mentally?
Ms. Horn, Ms. Marianne Horn.
One of the richest girls in all England.
Her aunt is giving a charity ball Saturday night.
I think I'll just ring up and offer my talents for charity.
Marianne...
Marianne...
Come to me.
What did you say?
Hmm?
Nothing, why?
Oh, I thought I heard you call my name.
You must be hearing things.
You know, I gotta hand it to that Vorelli.
His act's certainly different.
That dummy is fascinating.
He frightens me.
He really does seem to have some unusual powers.
Yeah, for once head office came up with a good idea in this Vorelli.
I still think he's a phony, but he's a damn good one.
I'd certainly like to get a chance to examine that dummy.
There, there you can help me.
Oh, can I now? - Mm.
That's just what you think.
Oh, I've had enough, thank you.
No, come on, please.
What can I do?
Well, as your aunt is holding her annual charity ball, all you've got to do is go and see The Great Vorelli, and invite him to come.
I know he will.
I saw the way he eyed you when you walked up on that stage.
Besides, your aunt would love it, you know it.
Give you a chance to get a good close look at that doll,
'cause you will invite him to stay the night, hmm?
It's the only way I can get a chance to examine it.
With all the press clippings on Vorelli, no one's ever been near that doll.
He won't let anybody see it or touch it, unless he's using it.
How 'bout it?
Well, you know he's very attractive.
I might just be attracted to him.
Oh?
Well, I'll take that chance.
How 'bout it?
All right, the things
I do for you.
You know, he's too good.
That Vorelli is just too good.
He must have some kind of gimmick.
It's the work of a highly trained hypnotist.
The art of hypnosis has advanced a great deal since the days of Mesmer.
How do you account for that dummy walking?
I think if you were to examine the dummy, you would find it a bag of mechanical tricks.
The tension between
Vorelli and that dummy, it was there, everybody felt it.
Mass hypnosis, Mr. English.
It's as real as individual hypnosis.
What we saw was a dramatical production.
I'm telling you, a succession of theatrical tricks.
Right, I don't want to see any jealousy.
If we keep on this way, you know what will happen.
You may go in now.
Thank you.
I am very pleased that we meet again, Ms. Horn.
Oh, I didn't even know if you'd remember me.
No, no, I did not forget you.
Oh, thank you, but I came to ask you for a favor.
To come to your aunt's charity ball?
Yes, but how did you guess?
Very prosaic, I'm afraid.
I read in the newspaper that your aunt was giving a charity ball.
I'm afraid you're right.
Will you join me?
What is it?
A wine from Sicily.
Rather sweet, but very good at this hour.
I always have it.
It's called Sangue della
Vergine, Blood of the Virgin.
Smell it, it has a lovely bouquet.
It's rather early for a drink.
Oh, but this is an occasion.
To the charity ball.
You mean you will come?
If you want me.
Oh, indeed we do.
This is marvelous.
I really didn't expect that I could walk in here and you'd accept the invitation just like that.
Oh, but you do know it's a charity.
Your fee...
Will be nothing.
My aunt will be so pleased.
I don't know how to thank you.
I should be delighted.
Oh, but you haven't finished your drink.
It's rather sweet.
Look into it.
So deep and rich, and red and warm.
Deep, rich, red, and warm.
Uh, you will come then?
If you want me.
Saturday then.
After your performance here, we'll send a car.
Thank you.
Aunt Eva, this is your fourth drink.
No dear, it's my fifth.
Oh, you're wicked.
Are you enjoying yourself, darling?
You're looking lovely.
Thank you.
Hi. - Hello.
Mark, you're absolutely marvelous.
You're doing everything beautifully.
You know, we've never had enough publicity.
Now remember...
Marianne, Marianne.
She adores it.
Don't worry, I will.
Oh dear, I must go talk to that dreadful Lady Hampton.
Oh, Lady Hampton!
What's the matter?
Hey?
Hmm?
Oh, nothing.
Daydreaming, I suppose.
Mark, I don't like it.
Well, your aunt loves it.
Hmm, she doesn't know what you're really here for.
As long as I get the Vorelli story, what does it matter?
Oh, it's just...
I don't know, I wish I had not seen him.
Oh Mark, when do I introduce Mr. Vorelli?
Just about time now.
Oh dear!
Come on, don't worry.
Everything will be all right.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a great surprise for you tonight.
Now, will everybody at the back please come forward?
Thank you, and then I'd like you to form a semicircle.
I have much pleasure in presenting The Great
Vorelli and Hugo.
Well Hugo,
I think you should sing a song for the audience.
No, I'm tired.
Well, you're in a surly mood.
I'm going to leave you alone and when you're ready to perform, fine.
In the meantime, if you'll excuse me,
I would like to have something to eat.
I've just come from the theater and I haven't had time.
Oh, ham.
I love it.
You cannibal.
Well, what would you have to eat, Hugo, to make you a cannibal, sawdust?
Don't I get anything to eat?
I'm hungry.
Whoever heard of a ventriloquist dummy eating?
I can eat.
I can eat like you can.
You are not the only one who likes to eat.
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm hungry, I want something to eat.
Now!
You surely don't expect me to wait on you?
No, but I do want to eat!
Very well then, get up and get it yourself.
Don't drink too much, Hugo.
It might make the sawdust in your stomach swell.
You're a dummy, Hugo.
A common puppet.
Hugo!
Put down the knife.
I said, put it down.
You know you frightened the ladies.
You must apologize.
Tell them you're sorry.
I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
And me?
I...
Yes, say it.
I am sorry.
Master.
Master.
He went upstairs 10 minutes ago.
He should be back by now.
If he does come down,
I'm going up.
I've got to have a look at that dummy.
It just isn't possible.
He must have someone inside it.
Some kind of a small man or a boy.
It's the only explanation.
Other than that, it's mechanical.
Darling, absolutely thrilling.
Perfectly marvelous.
Have you ever seen anything so marvelous, Mark?
No, never.
He comes.
Oh, excuse me.
Congratulations.
Mr. Vorelli, you were magnificent.
Thank you.
I think I should like a drink.
Would you care to join me, Ms.
Horn?
Thank you.
What a wonderful performance.
And when I call, you will come.
Wherever you are, you will come, but until I call, you will be yourself, your usual charming self.
I must leave you now, my dear.
Marianne.
Come to me.
Remember, you promised to obey me.
You must obey me.
Come to me, Marianne.
Marianne.
Now.
Marianne.
Come to me.
Marianne.
You have come, my Marianne.
You've obeyed me, but you do not know you're here.
Tomorrow, you will remember nothing.
I will remember nothing.
You are very beautiful, my Marianne.
You must learn to respond.
Are you afraid of me?
No.
Then why do you resist me?
You're not strong enough.
My thoughts have already penetrated your mind.
You see?
I have only to think.
Help me.
Find me in Berlin,
Find me in Berlin.
Hugo?
Your morning coffee. Mr.
English.
Thanks.
And how was your evening?
That dummy talked to me last night.
He came to my room.
He came to your room, the dummy?
That's right.
And what did he say to you,
Mark?
I know this is gonna sound crazy, but he asked for help.
He mentioned Berlin,
Berlin 1948.
When did you start having these nightmares, Mark?
Tell Dr. Louisa all about it.
There was no nightmare.
I saw and heard that dummy.
It was as real as...
You can't be serious.
I am.
Hello?
It's for you, Mark.
Hello?
Well hello, Mark.
Mark, Marianne is not feeling so well.
The whole house is in a shambles after last night.
I was wondering, I hoped you might come out here.
Well, what's happened?
Oh, you know, Mark, the charity ball, the preparations, the excitement.
Well, she's upset, enough to upset anyone.
Well, is she all right?
Well, Dr. Keisling, our family doctor is here.
He'd like to have a word with you.
Hello, Mr. English?
Yes, doctor?
Well, there's nothing to be alarmed about, Mr. English, but I think it would be best if you were to see Marianne.
Oh, what's wrong?
Oh, nothing serious, but I just think that you should be here.
Well, it will take me about two hours.
Very well.
I shall look forward to meeting you, goodbye.
I'm very glad that you were able to come so quickly.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
She seems to be in a state of semicoma, with overtones of delirium.
Make him stop, Mark.
I am, darling.
Mm.
Make him stop, Mark.
Mark, make him stop!
Darling, what is it?
He's calling me, Mark.
Please make him stop!
Who?
Please.
Make him stop.
Let her rest.
Perhaps if she sleeps, the fever will go.
Oh, make him stop.
A very strange case.
Ah, no thank you.
I was hoping your visit would've helped.
Perhaps she was hypnotized.
I beg your pardon?
Vorelli.
I don't understand.
I'm sorry, doctor.
She's been put in a trance by a professional hypnotist, a man called Vorelli, The
Great Vorelli.
Oh, Mr. English, in this day and age?
But how, for what reason, why?
You said yourself, you couldn't understand the symptoms.
Your very words were, "A strange case."
Yes, we still have to make the tests.
It's possibly some unknown virus.
Do you know Dr. Heller, the expert on hypnosis and mesmerism?
I once attended one of his lectures at the university.
Very interesting theories.
I'd like him to see Marianne.
Oh, of course if you feel it will help,
I've got no objection, but in the meanwhile we'll carry on with the tests.
Thank you, doctor.
Hmm, you don't believe a word
I'm saying, do you?
Well, let us say that I will keep what you Americans call, an open mind.
You, um, you wanted to see me?
It was a fine exhibition you put on out there tonight.
I wasn't feeling well.
You almost succeeded in ruining my entire performance.
I couldn't help it!
I'm not perfect.
Perhaps the work is becoming too hard for you, Magda.
You're not as young as you used to be.
No, not as young as that little bitch who shakes the hips at you.
Oh, don't talk that nonsense.
You went to her house.
Did you have her?
I suppose the stupid girl thinks she's in love with you now.
You've always been a fool.
Well, you did stay out with her all night, didn't you?
Did you succeed?
Tell me, did she respond?
Stop worrying.
You worry about nothing.
You told me it was just her money, but you won't fool me again!
Oh, I know that look in your eyes.
Money is very important.
Look, I was with you when you had nothing, when I gave you money to eat!
You've had it back with interest.
Oh, if you think that you can just throw me away like that.
Well, you're wrong!
You imagine things, my dear.
You must relax, be calm, quiet.
Oh, I know all about you, and if you think that you can get rid of me, just try!
Because then I'll go and see your precious little
Marianne Horn and tell her a few things.
Maybe even better, the police.
And what will you tell them, that I love you?
Oh, don't give me that.
You're a foolish girl and we're both upset.
I told you many times that I loved you.
You say anything.
But how many times have I had my arms around you?
And now you're getting tired of it.
You're a woman, and very, very beautiful.
Go, I think you need a little rest.
No, I can't, I, I have some work to do.
It will wait, come.
Would you like a cup of coffee, Mark?
Yeah, thanks.
Hello, Dr. Heller. - Hello.
Hello, Mr. English.
Oh, come in, doctor.
Louisa, how 'bout that coffee?
Yes, certainly.
Sit down. - Thank you.
I've just seen Ms. Horn.
Oh, how is she?
Well, she's slipped back into her semicomatose state.
Oh, by the way, I called Vorelli and talked to him.
He confirmed my findings that Marianne has a subconscious fear of hypnosis.
It's all his fault, isn't it?
He can't be blamed.
Marianne agreed to be hypnotized.
Vorelli even offered to put her into another state of hypnosis and break the control again, but it's too dangerous, much too dangerous.
We must find some other solution.
Yes, but how?
I'm not quite certain yet.
In any case, it will take time.
The mind is fragile.
One has to be delicate and patient.
There must be something I can do.
Hugo, she said you were ugly.
Good morning, Mr. English.
We finally got through to Mr.
Stanton...
Nevermind that, get me Bob
Garrett on the phone in Berlin, the elusive Mr. Garrett.
Try his hotel, if I know him, that's where he'll be.
Hey Mark, what's with the dawn patrol?
Say, how's the action in England?
Action, what action?
What are you talking about?
Limey broads, man, limey broads.
What else?
Nevermind that, I got a job for you.
A what?
Look man, I'm sweating my guts out here.
I'm at the typewriter right now working like hell on the
Berlin Wall article.
Get a pencil and pad ready.
Hold on a minute.
Honey, let me have the pad and pencil.
Thanks.
Okay Mark, fill me in, fill me in.
Magician, a hypnotist by the name of The Great Vorelli.
He used to work in Berlin.
I want you to find out everything, repeat, everything available on him.
I want you to go way back, as far back as 1947.
I want to know who he is, where he came from, and who he worked with.
Check the police files, the hospitals, the birth records, and the theaters, you got that?
Slow down, Mark boy, slow down.
How do you spell that?
V- O-R-E-L-L-I, Vorelli, okay.
Now get your tail out of bed and go to work.
We'll call, we'll call.
Stay cool and all that jazz.
Hey, how did you know
I was in bed?
It figures, boy, it figures.
Call me the moment you get something, okay?
So long, buddy.
Okay you.
Vorelli's assistant was found dead.
Listen to this.
"Ms. Gardinas was last seen alive by Carlos Santi,
"the stage dresser at
7:45 last night.
"He returned to awaken her
"for the evening performance at
8:10 and he found her dead.
"Mr. Jack Walton, the manager of the theater
"stated that Mr. Vorelli was in his office.
"He was talking with British customs officials concerning
"passport and clearance papers for a pending trip to Spain.
"The customs officials have verified Mr. Walton's statement.
"They were interrupted by shouts from Carlos Santi,
"who had just found the body."
Now here's the gem, listen.
Mr. Vorelli said, quote,
"The poor girl
"had not an enemy in the world, a most shocking crime.
"I hope the police will persevere,
"find the murderer and see that justice is done.
"I will miss her very much indeed."
The Great Vorelli with an airtight alibi.
You know, what I think?
I think he killed her.
Somehow he killed her.
Let's see what Bob Garrett digs up in Berlin.
Well, nothing we've done so far has helped.
The new drug from America seems to have a tranquilizing effect, that is something.
Mr. Vorelli called again today.
He seemed very concerned about Marianne.
Yes, he calls regularly, very nice chap.
Doctor, I think you should come up and see Ms. Horn.
She's still delirious.
I was afraid of that.
Another injection, nurse.
One half cc.
Phone call for you, Mark, your office.
How is she?
Hello, Louisa.
Yeah, what is it?
He's onto something, what does that mean?
Is that all he told you?
Louisa, get me a ticket on the next plane to Berlin.
Call Garrett and have him meet me at the airport.
Have him reserve me a room at the Hilton.
No, I don't know how long
I'll be there.
Marianne, Marianne.
Yes, yes, it's coming now.
Oh, Grace.
Grace, you look very pretty.
Do you think you know the routine well enough?
Yes sir.
Poor Magda, I shall miss her in many ways.
You will go on in her place tonight.
Thank you, sir.
You may go now, Grace.
I shall try not to disappoint you, Mr. Vorelli.
I'm sure you won't, my dear.
Well, where do we start?
Relax, Mark, relax.
I'll tell you all about it.
In 1947, Vorelli was just breaking into Vaudeville, but before that he was a doctor.
A doctor?
The way I get it, after he got his degree, he refused to practice.
He became a fanatic on the mysteries of the East.
He even went out there to study.
Where?
Egypt, India, Burma, and we suspect an entire year with the lamas in Tibet, always studying the same thing.
Hypnosis?
No, not exactly.
It's more like he believed that you could separate man from his soul.
It's really hard to pin down,
Mark.
What about the Vaudeville act?
In December '47, he was kicked out of the medical society.
I haven't had a chance to check up on the reasons yet, but anyway, he was kicked out.
The next anybody saw of him was when he showed up in Vaudeville.
He had this act with a boy and girl, hypnotism and all that jazz.
He'd put them under and they'd do things.
One of the tricks Vorelli did was to stick a dagger into the boy.
Through a friend of mine,
I've been able to locate the woman.
That's where I'm taking you now.
Hmm, I think you might be from the American police, looking for something!
We are not from the police.
What is it then you want?
I want to know what happened in 1948 from when you worked with him.
There was an accident, wasn't there?
Mm, yeah.
And they would not listen to me.
Your partner, a boy, part of the act?
Oh yes, Hugo.
Hugo?
Tell us about it.
It would be better to, cut Vorelli's throat, hmm?
It was a long time ago.
I was younger.
Vorelli hired Hugo Novik and me.
We had an act, Hugo and I.
Dancers.
We made little money, but we were happy.
Vorelli said we would make more, okay.
Yes, go on.
Well, Vorelli would hypnotize us, make us do things, but offstage, we were ourselves.
But then, Hugo changed.
Vorelli became his master.
Then, he got the dummy.
Oh, it looks like Hugo.
Yes, it could resemble me.
It will be, it will be.
Get out and don't come back until I call for you!
You will not believe this.
The police did not believe, but I saw!
One night, I come into the dressing room.
It is a dress rehearsal, like taking the soul of Hugo, giving it to the dummy.
I tell you, I saw!
I believe you, Mercedes.
Then you are the first, and I am not alone.
There is another who knows.
So go on, what happened next?
I told you, Vorelli would hypnotize us, make me do foolish things.
He made Hugo lift incredible weights, stick a dagger into him here, into his breast.
Then, one night.
This time, Hugo, you're going to die.
He is my slave.
He will feel nothing.
That is the power of hypnotism.
Behold.
Never before had he felt it, but this time, every time, many times before,
Hugo felt nothing!
But this time, Hugo felt the blood come.
A little hard to believe.
Nobody believes.
The police, nobody.
Hans, come here.
They would not believe Hans either.
Do you want me, Mercedes?
Hans, here he is.
He will tell you.
These are reporters.
They want to know about Vorelli.
Tell them, go on.
Tell them about the dummy.
Well, there isn't much I can say.
I was a cleaner at the time.
I was not even on the stage when it happened.
I was in Vorelli's room.
Everybody was out so I could clean up the room.
I did not see, but I heard, when the dagger went into Hugo.
I saw the puppet.
Terror, then the police, confusion, the hearing.
Did you both testify at the hearing?
Yeah, they asked questions,
I tell them.
They laugh, call me crazy.
What was the verdict?
He willingly took the risk, accident.
He lived for three months after the accident in a hospital like a vegetable.
He did not move for three months, just laid there and looked at the ceiling.
Then, he died.
He died.
Gentlemen, I don't want to push you out, but Mercedes has some business to attend to.
Customers come here, you know?
So if you're through, perhaps you will give us 100 marks for the information.
Well, we lose more than that in time already.
Pay him, and Bobby, take me right back to that airport.
At first I thought Vorelli had a mechanical doll, or even a living person inside the dummy.
I even sneaked into his room and examined the doll, but it was nothing but a wooden puppet.
I never told you this before, doctor, the night I examined that doll, it came to my room.
It talked to me.
You are dreaming.
Yeah, I knew you'd say that, and at first I thought I was dreaming too.
But what that doll told me led me directly to
Mercedes in Berlin.
I know you'll think I'm mad, but somehow he's put a man's life into that doll.
You have a most vivid imagination.
But I just don't like it, doctor.
Marianne is bedridden.
It's too like Hugo Novik.
For three months he lay in a bed helpless.
You are magnifying this problem.
With Hugo Novik, it was catalepsy.
Catalepsy?
Yeah, there's no question.
A perfect case of traumatic shock.
Well, that explains it.
The dagger, only instead of telling him it wouldn't hurt, he probably told him he would die, or all but die.
And for three months he lay in a hospital helpless, while Vorelli completed his transfer.
He put his spirit into that dummy before Hugo died.
And all this while,
Hugo Novik's soul has been inside the dummy?
Ah, this is madness, and besides,
Marianne never suffered from any traumatic shocks.
Well, maybe she did,
I don't know.
The night Vorelli performed out at her aunt's house, something happened to her in his room.
The next day she was laying helpless in bed.
Anyway, Hugo Novik was
15 years ago.
His powers may have advanced since then.
You are wasting your time, Mark.
I tell you, he's robbed this man's soul.
I don't know how, and I can't give you any scientific explanations, but I do know that's what's happened!
Mark, now do you really think we should seriously discuss this?
A soul transferred by a
Vaudeville magician?
Vorelli is no mere Vaudeville magician, look at Marianne.
She's a very highly strung girl.
Hers is a case of interrupted hypnosis.
This I can understand.
Okay, what do you suggest?
That you forget all this foolishness!
Forget about Vorelli.
You are tired, overworked, perhaps even a little bit jealous.
And that's all there is to it?
You can take my word for it.
I wish I could believe you.
Dr. Heller here.
Oh yes, Dr. Keisling.
Yes?
Yeah, oh good.
Marianne is awake, and perfectly normal?
Oh yes, of course.
I shall be out there this afternoon.
Late, thank you, doctor.
Goodbye.
Well, thank God for that.
Now Mark, take my advice.
Forget about Vorelli, forget about dummies.
Marianne is much better now.
Vorelli is not the villain you imagine.
Perhaps you shouldn't stay too long.
I see, of course.
I understand.
You will tell your aunt and uncle that you love me.
I love you.
I love you.
And you will tell Mark that you are going to marry me.
I'm going to marry you.
I must go now, but when I call you, you will come.
Remember, when I call, you will come, Marianne.
Hello. - Hi, how are you?
It's good to see you.
You're looking much better.
Thank you, the doctor took me off the drugs.
Mark, I've got to talk to you.
Hmm?
I'm going away with Vorelli.
I'm in love with him.
You're what?
I'm in love with him.
I'm sorry, Mark.
How can I explain?
It happened the night he stayed here.
I, I just don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.
Well Hugo, tonight we fly to Spain, and there the very wealthy and beautiful
Ms. Marianne Horn will become my bride.
It's a delicious thought.
We'll give our last performance tonight and be on our way.
All four of us, you, Hugo, my bride to be, and my ugly little wooden lady.
And then, after a few months when my transfer is complete, my beautiful young wife will die, leaving me all her money, and you an ugly little wooden companion.
But then you're ugly too, aren't you?
I'll have the same again.
Oh, I'm a bloody fool.
I've had to cop to a lot of unnecessary expense for an article about a charlatan, a third rate phony.
The only woman I ever cared about falls in love with him.
If they don't fire me after this fiasco, they're as crazy as I am.
Sleep, my Marianne.
Deep, deep sleep.
We'll wake my lovely Marianne after the performance tonight.
Hugo, you must behave when we give our last performance.
You've been getting out of control much too often.
You've been in your little wooden body so long, you've become an individual again.
I think I must teach you a little lesson.
Ah, dear Grace, I'm very busy.
I thought you wanted me, you know?
Not now, dear.
I have a few things to clear up with the manager before I leave.
I shall come to your room.
Don't be long.
As soon as I'm through with him.
Hugo, I'm your master.
Get back in your cage or I will destroy you.
Don't be alarmed,
Mr. English.
Vorelli is now in wooden doll.
I am his master, the tables are turned.
You need have no fear for Marianne.
She is sleeping peacefully.
When I wake her, she will be her normal self.
Mr. English, get me out of here!
I am the Great Vorelli, he can't do this to me.
Please, Mr. English, don't let him do it!
I'll do anything you say.
Get me out of here!
I'll do anything you say.
Please, I am the Great Vorelli.
Hello?
Hi Kit, this is Libby Mannering.
Hi Lib.
What are you doing tonight?
Hmm, nothing, what did you have in mind?
My mother and father are going away.
How lucky can you get?
Overnight, they'll be gone till tomorrow.
Are they leaving you alone?
Well no, they're getting a babysitter for Tess, my sister.
Don't they trust you?
Well sure they do, but you know how parents are.
Listen can you come for dinner and then spend the night?
I don't know about all night, my father's awfully peculiar.
Oh, so is mine.
But I can handle him.
Try it Kit, we'll have a lot of fun.
Okay, I'll ask him and call you right back.
Hello?
Lib?
Hi Kit, can you come?
Just for dinner, I can't stay overnight.
Did you tell your father my parents were going away overnight?
Yeah I goofed.
That's why he said no.
Well maybe if I talked to him.
I'm very persuasive.
You don't know my father.
But at least I can come for dinner.
He'll drive me over, how do we get there?
You live out in the wilderness.
It's not that bad, it's easy really.
You go about 15 miles past the gas station on Elm, then you turn right on Tompkin Street, you keep going right until you pass the railroad tracks, and then you turn left and go for about six miles.
You come to a red barn, and you pass...
Tess, Tess!
Oh you little fool.
You're supposed to be sick.
You come in the house this minute, do you hear me?
How can you play outside with the thermometer in your mouth?
You little idiot, wait until
I tell Mommy you went outside.
Don't tell her.
Stop talking.
You can't take anybody's temperature while they're running around.
Don't you know that silly, now sit there.
If there's a fever, it's mine, I'll read it.
Supposing you make a mistake?
I won't, you start at the top, count back to the red line.
106, 10s, 104.
I'm normal, I'm a normal person.
Oh that's your opinion.
Mother? Mother?
Yes?
I checked Tess' temperature and she's normal.
Did you hear,
Daddy? I'm normal.
Well, that's my girl.
She thinks she should get a medal.
A medal, really? Well.
Oh have you kids seen my tobacco pouch?
You know you could lose a battleship in this place?
You really look cute, Daddy.
Cute?
Well, I'll buy that.
Libby.
Don't forget to tell
Mrs. Beale to give Tess one of these before dinner and one after.
And then she goes...
Goes straight to bed.
Big mouth!
Will you two please stop it?
Now here's the Wards' number,
Santa Barbara, 5930, and Dr. Sweeney's home number, okay?
Mm-hmm.
We're running late honey.
Oh I really think we should wait until Mrs. Beale comes.
All right.
I'll get it.
Yes?
Ms. Mary this is Mrs. Beale.
Oh hello Mrs. Beale.
Hi Kit!
Hi Libby!
Hi.
Hi.
How are you?
Fine, how are you?
Fine.
I want you to meet my father.
Hello Mr. Austin.
Hello dear.
Are you coming in to meet my folks?
Well I'm sorry,
I haven't the time, but please thank your mother for having Kit over, okay?
Sure.
And I'll pick you up at 11:30.
Oh, Daddy couldn't you make it 12?
Mmm-mm, 11:30's late enough.
You have to be up early tomorrow, remember?
Yeah, I'll be ready.
Good night Libby.
Good night Mr. Austin.
When he says 11:30 he means 11:30.
Well come on then, let's not waste any time.
David we can't go.
I'm sorry, but we'll just have to call the Wards and break the date.
Well for heaven's sake, why?
Mrs. Beale can't come.
Mother.
Daddy, this is Kit Austin.
Oh, hello.
Hello my name is Tess.
Hi Tess.
Hello Kit.
Oh Ms. Mannering, it was so nice of you to invite me to dinner.
Now what is all this about Mrs. Beale not coming?
Mrs. Beale is sick.
Ah...
Oh Mother, we'll be all right alone.
Well it'll be pretty awkward to break the date now honey, it's business as well as social you know, couldn't we get somebody else?
But dear I tried to get everybody before
I got Mrs. Beale.
Mother, when are you gonna realize
I'm practically grown up.
Well you know she's got a point there.
No, no, she's very responsible.
You remember how she held down the fort when your mother was ill and that was two years ago.
Well I suppose we could start back early.
Sure, we'd be back at the crack of dawn.
Don't worry Daddy, we'll be all right.
Countdown from the top, see how normal I am.
I'm very normal.
I know you're just fine.
Goodbye.
Goodbye Libby.
Oh you do have those numbers now?
Yes Mother, the
Wards and Dr. Sweeney.
Okay.
Ellie come on.
Oh all right, goodbye Kit.
Bye bye, have a good time.
Thank you.
It's so different, from our apartment I mean.
It's so big.
Come on, I wanna show you my room.
Tess, you set the table.
Libby I wanna show her my room.
You can do that later, set the table now.
Oh let her come,
Libby. Come on, Tess.
I wish I'd worn my jeans.
Oh I'll lend you a pair of mine.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
No.
Are you spoiled?
Probably.
Libby, what is that?
That's Carmen.
Go ahead, pet her.
Well, we've got a pony and ducks.
Even a tame raccoon.
My father's a frustrated country squire, I think.
Come on.
Lib, don't you ever get lonely out here?
Ah, it's funny.
I never used to be.
Until I grew up, this was just all there was.
You know, pets and bicycles and a sandwich and a glass of milk after school.
But I was never lonely.
And now?
Well now it seems like everything I want is someplace else.
You know what I mean.
Parties, the movies, even going to a friend's house for dinner, they're all someplace else.
Give your boys a roadmap?
It's not that bad.
But when I do have a date, they have to drive all the way out here, pick me up, drive back to town and drive me all the way back here.
What's the sense of making it so hard for 'em?
What's the matter Lib?
Oh, Daddy was supposed to fix this.
He probably did, but nothing he ever fixes stays fixed.
Come on Kit, help me.
I wouldn't just be lonely out here,
I'd be scared stiff.
You wanna look around some more?
There's a lot of things to see.
No, let's go back.
Kit, Kit, Kit!
Kit, it's for you, a phone call, a boY-
Maybe it's Gary.
Tess, that's not funny.
Hello Gary?
Hello?
Hello?!
Hello!
There's nobody there.
He must've hung up.
Nobody called, that's her idiot notion of a joke.
I'm sorry.
We do it all the time, call people for fun.
Yeah we do it all the time.
Wait till you hear what they say.
Pick a name, Kit.
Go ahead, close your eyes and pick a name.
Pick a name?
Any name!
Gimme the phone.
William Harrison.
One, four, one.
Nine, one.
Hello?
Hello, is Bill there?
Who is this?
This is Alice, I've been waiting for him.
Almost an hour.
Waiting for him?
Yes, at the Green Garter Club.
He promised to be on time.
Well this is Mrs. Harrison.
I'll be sure to tell him.
Oh, this is his wife?
Oh I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.
Okay it's your turn now Kit.
John Adams.
Six, one.
Hello?
Hello, is John there?
Yes, he's here.
John, it's for you.
Yes?
Hello John?
This is Alice.
I've been waiting for you, almost an hour.
Oh but I wanted to meet you Alice.
Yes I did.
But you see I already had a date.
With my wife, who also wants to use the phone.
Oh whoops, I struck out.
Give it to me!
No, you'll just get scared and hang up.
No I won't. Find me a number Lib.
Okay.
Ah, two, three, two.
Two.
One.
One.
Three.
Three.
Hello?
Mommy, is this Mommy?
No, this isn't your mother, dear.
But I told Mommy
I'd call her so she can pick me up at the movie theater on Elm Street.
Well, why don't you try again and dial very carefully honey.
But this is the wrong number, and I spent my last dime.
Could you call my mommy for me please and tell her to come get me?
Of course darling, what's her number?
Her number is OL4367.
I'll call her right now, and you wait right where you are.
I'll wait here, thank you.
Stupid.
But you gave her our number.
Well it's the only number I know.
Hello?
Your little girl called my number by mistake.
She's waiting for you at the theater on Elm Street.
Well it's so nice of you to call.
Thank you.
I'm sure Nancy was upset.
I'll pick her up right away.
And thanks again.
Now let's see if
I remember Dave.
You like your coffee strong, hot, and black, right?
Right.
Do you know that that phone is still busy?
Thank you.
Do you think anything could be wrong?
Oh honey I'd be worried if they weren't on the phone, so they're talking, so everything's perfectly normal.
Of course.
You know how kids are.
Oh...
Steve Marak.
Five, six.
Seven, nine, one.
Hello.
Hello, is Steve there?
Who is this?
Just a friend.
Look sweetie, are you sure you got the right number?
Oh, well why would Steve give me a wrong number?
Steve?
Steve!
Hold on.
Steve.
Look he's taking a bath, call him later.
In the bathtub!
Tell her you've gotta talk to him!
But it's terribly important.
Hold on.
Steve, will you rush it up?
I wanna get my things...
You ape!
You belong in a cage!
And you wanna know why I'm leaving you!
You're not jealous, you're not that normal!
You're insane!
So he doesn't wanna get out of the tub.
Well try again then!
What's his number?
Oh, I don't remember, what was his name?
It started with an M.
Mannering?
That's our name, stupid.
Oh no it was a strange name.
Well how can we find it now, you closed the book.
It started with an M.
Well, let him stay in the tub, find me somebody else Kit.
Judith?
Judith?
Steve?
Steve.
Steve?
Steve?
What happened?
I stumbled, fell against the shower door.
Are you all right?
It shook me up a little.
I thought Judith was leaving?
She left all right.
She didn't even finish packing.
We had another fight, a beaut.
I'll send her things after her.
She's gone for good.
I'm here Steve.
Don't let this hurt you.
She's not worth it.
You married a childish, empty-headed, little tramp.
But now we can make something wonderful together.
We have made it.
You know that.
Your hands are trembling.
I gotta get her things out of here as soon as possible.
I gotta get dressed.
Of course, go ahead.
I'll straighten up in here.
FIE?
What is it?
Steve?
Later.
Will you promise to come over later?
I tried to call you three times, your line was busy.
Judy must've been trying to call a cab.
I was kinda worried.
That's why I came over, your back door was open.
You know it's kinda nice being neighbors.
I can check up on you.
Your phone's off the hook, Steve.
That's funny.
Good night Amy.
Later.
Is this Mr. John Hamburger?
Yes it is.
That's fine, would you send over six with pickles and onions?
Get lost nuisance burger!
What did he say?
He said, "Get lost nuisance burger!"
You won't believe this
Libby, I swear you won't!
Donald Ileak!
Donald Ileak?
Is his brother the plumber?
I'm hungry!
Okay now I'll show you something.
Hello?
I saw what you did, and I know who you are.
Will you stop bothering people?
Oh, no sense of humor.
Yes.
I saw what you did, and I know who you are.
You did?
Nothing's sacred!
Operator.
Operator, I've been getting a busy signal at this number for over two hours, could you check and see if there's anything wrong with the line?
Yes Ma'am, that was OL4367?
Yes, that's right, thank you.
Hello?
Yes?
Yes Ma'am that number is busy.
I see, thank you.
I saw what you did, and I know who you are.
Slick, Slick where are you?
Slick come here!
Slick!
Hey, hey, from now on when you have some business to attend to, do it at the curb.
Don't wander off!
Hey come on let's go.
Next time it's your turn.
Hey what's wrong?
Nothing, nothing.
I saw what you did, and I know who you are.
Ewvv!
You pig, you got peanut butter and jelly all over this page.
That's because I put my sandwich on it.
I put it on the man in the bathtub.
You what?
The man in the bathtub remember?
He couldn't talk 'cause he was taking a bath.
I put my sandwich down then, on the phone book.
Steve, Steve Mara k!
Let's see if he's still in the tub.
Maybe he drowned!
HEY, I'm hungry, are you?
Steve.
Steve!
Steve?
I've been waiting for you.
Here, let me do that.
You shouldn't be alone, especially tonight.
Come on in.
Your shoes are all muddy, where have you been?
I had a flat, I had to change it.
Well we're gonna get those shoes right off.
Come on, let's sit down,
I'm gonna take care of you whether you like or not.
Come on, take your shoes off.
I'm giving the orders now.
I know what you need.
But first, I'm gonna give you a nice stiff drink.
I'm gonna have one too.
I'll show you what it is to be taken care of.
Let's drink to that first night we had together.
I never knew anything could be so wonderful.
Now we can drink to a whole lifetime of nights like that.
You know Judith was wrong for you.
She was too young, too young to be a wife, a companion or, ugh, anything.
I want you to relax.
We're gonna have a beautiful life.
Just being together, that's all that really matters.
We can go away, anywhere we want.
Oh I need you Steve.
Let it ring.
You need me.
Let it ring!
Yes?
I sot him!
Well talk to him!
Is this Steve?
Steve Marak?
That's right, who's this?
I saw what you did, and I know who you are.
What does he say?
He's playing along, sounds exciting.
Yes, I know who you are, and I saw what you did.
Who, who is this?
He wants to know who I am.
Oh make up a name, make up a name.
Suzette.
Suzette?
Where are you calling from?
Where can I reach you?
What a swinger!
He wants a date?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Suzette?
Suzette!
Steve?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Just a business deal
I've been working on.
Look I may have to go out later, you'd better go home.
No, Steve.
I'll wait, right here.
Please, Amy, I wanna be alone till I can work this out.
Who is Suzette?
Get off my back, give me room to breathe, you don't own me yet.
I'm sorry Steve, truly I am.
I can't help worrying,
I just don't want to see you hurt again.
There's nothing to worry about.
It's just a business deal and Suzette's a part of it.
Darling if you're in trouble, I wanna help any way I can.
Amy please, go on home, I'll be over later.
Look I have money, lots of it!
It's ours now, we can go away together, please, please let me help.
Amy, trust me.
We'll be together, it'll work out that way,
I promise you, just trust me.
I trust you with all my heart.
Hello?
Hello Steve?
Hello Suzette.
Why did you hang up on me before?
I've got to see you.
As soon as possible.
See what I mean, sexy.
Hi Steve.
Suzette, I wanna meet you.
I wanna meet YOU tOO.
What a sex maniac!
He does want a date.
Anywhere you say.
Well, somewhere nice and quiet.
I know you realize how important this is to both of us.
It means everything to me Suzette, everything.
I'll meet you anywhere, at your home, at work.
I know you're smart, I know you want the same things I do.
That's all that's keeping me going, nothing matters but seeing you.
You can trust me Suzette, I promise.
Suzette?
Oh my God.
You'll be hearing from me, goodbye now.
Wait a minute, please.
I'll call you back, I promise.
Then you will meet me?
Promise?
Suzette, Suzette?
Where can I reach you?
Oh didn't he sound exciting?
Yeah and sexy.
Well why'd you hang up then?
Oh I can't meet him
Kit, you know that.
So what's the use?
Oh call him once more, please.
No, game's over.
I wonder what he looks like.
We'll never know.
That's Tess, she fell outta bed again.
Libby, Libby!
Libby
I had a bad dream, Libby.
Well, that's all right, try to forget it.
I can't, it was horrible.
Try anyway, it was just a dream.
All right, if you'll stay here until I fall asleep.
Okay.
Libby?
What?
If you did meet him, what would you do?
I don't know, go for a ride or something or just talk.
About what?
Well, whatever he wanted to.
His work, girls he's known, where he's been.
But what would you talk about?
Boys, where I've been.
Libby you haven't been anywhere.
Well I went to New
York with Daddy once.
I guess I'd lie a little bit.
Well, what if he didn't wanna just talk?
I'm not exactly a baby Kit.
I can take care of myself.
Just by talking?
Suppose that he wanted to kiss you?
Well, maybe I'd let him.
Just once, or as much as he wanted?
Well, I don't know, he sounds nice.
His voice was so deep, so exciting.
It was like he was running his hand down my back.
Real slowly...
Was it cold?
That's a silly question.
I'll tell you what would happen if you really did meet him.
He'd take one look at you and send you straight home.
Anyway he's probably married.
Oh Kit, you're so naive.
Just because a man's married...
I just wish I knew what he looked like.
Kit, if we could find out.
Tess are you asleep?
Sure I'm asleep.
We could meet him Kit, well see him I mean, without him seeing us.
I don't know what you mean.
Well we know where he lives,
I could take Mommy's car.
I've got my learner's permit.
Libby Mannering!
You wouldn't dare!
I will if you will.
We could park near his house and see him.
You're not leaving me alone, Lib.
Ah, well I thought you were asleep.
I was.
I can't leave Tess, Kit.
Well I'd stay with her.
No, she's my responsibility.
I just couldn't leave her.
Well our problem is about the same, Tom, trying to convert to computers without violating the union contracts.
Well I'm seeing Roy
Miller next week to go over some of the figures.
David?
David there's no answer at home.
Well there must be.
But I've tried three times in the last 10 minutes the phone rings but there's no answer.
And you're sure you've got the right number?
Well of course I had the operator check it.
Well maybe they've got the TV turned way up.
The phone's in the same room, they'd hear it if they were there.
Now calm down honey, maybe they're out saying good night to Carmen.
That's our goat.
Or taking a look at the moon or they're up in their room playing records.
Now relax, what could be wrong?
I don't know, I just wish we hadn't left them alone.
Number one, we don't get out of the car.
Number two, we stay just 10 minutes.
Well if that's all we're gonna do, what did you put on your best dress for?
And all that make-up?
Just in case!
Suppose he doesn't come out?
It doesn't matter, now remember, nobody gets out of this car, is that understood?
There it is Lib, stop!
Lib turn out the lights.
Be quiet!
It kinda looks like him, doesn't it?
Like he sounds I mean.
Sort of mysterious.
Oh Lib there's no reason for him to come out.
He's probably in bed by now.
Well, maybe he's got a dog.
He might have to take it for a walk.
Oh this is silly Lib, let's go home please.
We just got here.
He's probably sitting there, reading, or watching TV.
If I honk I bet he'd hear it!
Well don't!
Look we can come back in the daytime, let's go home now, please!
If we don't see him tonight, we never will.
Oh Lib, you said you wouldn't get out of the car.
I'm just gonna walk past his house.
Oh Lib please don't go!
Lib, come back Lib!
Please, Libby!
Go get her Kit, make her come back!
Oh that's all right Tess, nothing to worry about.
She's gone Kit, I can't see her.
You little tramp!
Throwing yourself at him, chasing him.
I don't even know him!
Get outta here!
You're a liar, I heard you on the telephone.
Now get outta here!
Please, we didn't mean to cause any trouble, it was just a game.
I know what kind of a game, with a man over twice your age.
Now get outta here!
Somebody's coming!
Mrs. Marak please, you don't understand!
You little tramp!
They caught Libby, get back Tess, quick!
Please, let me explain!
Get outta here, go!
Look, just a minute, if you ever try to see him or call him again...
I won't, I promise I won't!
You'd better promise, now get in there!
Go on!
Oh no, no please don't take that.
Go on home!
Look honey.
You're too young.
Get out!
I met your little business deal, Steve.
Suzette.
What did she tell you?
She lied of course.
Another childish, empty-headed, little tramp.
Your taste is sickening.
She even lied about her name.
Ellie Mannering.
Keep it, as a souvenir.
Just a reminder that this is your last Suzette.
And it is your last one, get that through your head right now.
Look I don't need you to plan my life or to give me orders, you wanna crack a whip, get yourself a dog.
Oh but the orders are just starting.
We're gonna get married, go away and do exactly what you said, be together.
You're crowding me again Amy.
I got things to do.
Sure you have things to do.
With Suzette.
I heard you on the phone with her.
I listened in the bedroom.
I also know what happened here tonight t0 Judith.
It's a simple choice, Steve.
Life with me or no life at all.
You're blackmailing me into marrying you.
You must want it awful bad, the ring with the Mrs. in front of your name.
But only with you.
What you're saying is I have no choice.
None at all.
Very simple, all I have to do is pick up the phone and call the police.
Well Amy, maybe it'll work.
Who knows, you might be just what I needed.
How about a drink huh? I can use one.
It'll work.
Maybe not at first, but it will work.
A little ice.
Steve.
Yeah?
Please try to understand.
I had to do it this way.
What'll we drink to?
How about uh, to us?
Okay, to us.
Steve...
Oh I told you we shouldn't have come.
Who was she, Lib?
Mrs. Mara k.
I've just got to get it from her.
What Lib?
She took Mommy's registration card.
Maybe if we went back, but explained it was all a joke?
Oh we're in enough trouble.
If you go back I'm getting out of this car now.
Hello, Sgt. Harris.
Oh Sgt. Harris, this is David Mannering.
The Mr. Mannering in Oakland Hills?
Yes that's right, on Woodbridge Road.
I've been calling my house for almost an hour now my children are there alone and there's no answer.
Well where are you calling from?
Well I'm in Santa Barbara,
90 miles from the house.
Could the phone be out of order?
No, no I had the operator check the number.
I wonder if you could send a car out there?
Well yes, but could they just be asleep?
Well of course they might be asleep or playing outside, but
I'd certainly appreciate it if you'd check.
I'll send a car out right away, Mr. Mannering.
Oh thank you
Sergeant, thank you.
Yes we'll be at
Santa Barbara 5930.
And will you call us back here?
5930, yes sir.
Thank you very much.
David let's go home, now.
Well look honey, everything's probably fine.
There's no point in leaving now, not until we hear from the police.
You're gonna catch it when
Mommy and Daddy get home!
Tess Mannering if you say one word, just one word!
She won't have to, they'll know we were out in the car.
Oh Libby what are we gonna do.
Oh I wish I knew.
You're gonna catch it!
I know one thing, you're going to bed, now!
But suppose I have another bad dream!
That's your problem.
You're gonna catch it anyway.
And you better take all that stuff off your face too!
Oh Lib if my dad finds out he'll never let me come here again.
You know how strict he is.
If my parents find out, that's the end of the car.
And I'll be grounded for years.
Libby you've got to get it, you've just got to!
Well I wanted to go back, but who chickened out?
Yeah but who got us into this mess?
And remember, we'd just stay five minutes, and nobody gets out of the car.
Then you got out!
How did I know his wife would be there?
I told you he was probably married.
Shouldn't have gotten out in the first place.
Hello?
Is Mr. Mannering there?
No he's not.
Is Mrs. Mannering there?
Are you Mrs. Mannering?
No, she's gone too.
This is his daughter.
Well when will your parents be back?
Not till tomorrow morning, can I take a message?
No, just tell them
Mr. Jackson called, it's a business matter.
Good night.
Tess, Tess?
Did you take that pill?
Libby?
What?
How are you gonna get the registration card?
I don't know, maybe I can call Mrs. Marak in the morning.
Get up before my parents come home.
You've got to Libby!
I know, I know, stop worrying.
Tess?
Oh where is she?
Tess?
Tess, are you hiding in there?
Kit, Tess is gone!
Gone where?
I don't know, come on, we've gotta find her.
Oh Libby do we have to go outside?
She's not in the house.
Now he's gone.
Tess?
Tess!
Tess, are you out there?
Come in the house this minute.
Come on.
Libby she wouldn't go this far.
That idiot would go anywhere.
Oh that little fool.
Oh when I get my hands on her.
Tess?
Tess!
Oh I bet she's in here.
Tess.
Tess Mannering what are you doing in here?
I couldn't sleep, I had another bad dream.
Well why didn't you tell me.
It's my problem, you said so.
Anyway Gypsy couldn't sleep either.
Oh Libby, let's go back.
Another thing, I was locked in, couldn't open the door.
On Libby!
Relax, relax, relax.
Well, no wonder your folks couldn't find you, have you been out here all night?
No we went out in Mommy's car.
Yes, with Gypsy.
That's our pony.
Okay, come on, let's get back to the house.
You're gonna have to phone your parents, they're worried stiff, come on honey.
Come on.
Come on little lady, ah.
How long have you been out there?
Okay honey, Okay-
But you gave your mother a very bad time.
Let me talk to her David.
Libby?
Hello mother.
I'm sorry you were worried.
We were just out back.
We didn't hear the phone.
Yes I know dear but you should never have gone out.
How's Tess, did she take her pills?
Yeah she's fine.
Well you get right to bed, you understand?
Yes mother, we will.
Right away, I promise.
We'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Good night, dear.
Goodbye.
They were upset.
I don't blame 'em.
Okay now.
No more wandering around outside tonight huh?
As for you.
You get to bed.
Lib do you think they believed you?
I mean about just being out back?
Why shouldn't they?
Oh oh, that's my father.
I'm going to bed like he told me to.
Lib we've got to stick to our story.
But suppose I can't get the registration back?
Whether you do or not, we never left here.
I can't let my father find out, you know that.
He won't, don't worry.
Promise Lib, never to tell?
Sure Kit.
Say it, say you promise.
Say it!
I promise!
Hello Lib.
Hello Mr. Austin.
I gather you two gave
Mr. and Ms. Mannering quite a scare?
We were just out back, Daddy.
At this hour?
I don't think you used very good judgment.
Come along, Kit.
And Lib I suggest you lock up and tuck yourself in.
I will Mr. Austin.
Bye Lib, call you tomorrow.
Good night Mr.
Austin, bye Kit.
BYE bye.
Good night Lib.
Bye.
BYE bye.
Was Mr. Austin mad?
Well, not exactly mad.
Just kind of, well, grim.
Lib, when are Mommy and Daddy coming home?
In the morning.
What?
In the morning.
What time?
Uh, about nine or 10.
Lib will you sleep with me tonight?
Oh Tess, you're such a baby.
Please, I'll do you a favor some clay.
Okay.
What'd you say?
I said okay!
Goodie!
Can we leave the light on?
Tess, what are you afraid of?
I'll be right here.
Move over.
Move over!
And that winds up the late scores, sports fans.
It's still anybody's pennant, anybody's ballgame you might say.
Uh just a moment ladies and gentlemen.
Here is a special bulletin.
The body of an unidentified woman was found earlier tonight in the wooded area adjoining Oakland Hills.
That's not far from here.
The victim, described by police as young and attractive, was brutally, sadistically murdered.
According to Chief of
Detectives John Halliday.
Police were directed to the dead woman's shallow grave by
Linda Carson, 22, of Abaum Grove Township.
While searching for her dog in the woods near Oakland Hills, at approximately 8:30 tonight,
Ms. Carson saw a man lurking suspiciously among the trees.
According to Chief
Halliday, Ms. Carson saw what the man was doing.
Digging a shallow trench in the rocky ground.
Prompted by what she described as a hunch,
Ms. Carson reported the incident to the police.
According to Ms.
Carson's description, the murderer was tall, dark-haired, about 40 years of age.
To repeat.
What's the matter with you kid?
Oh that's horrible.
You've been shaking like a leaf ever since we left the Mannerings.
Might as well level with me kid.
What have you been up to tonight?
I saw what you did, and I know who you are.
What did you say?
Nothing Daddy.
Lib, Lib!
You didn't let Spot in.
He's all right.
He doesn't mind sleeping outside.
He isn't sleeping, he's barking.
Well then you go to sleep.
I can't, he's keeping me awake.
Well then let him in.
Okay.
Spot?
Spot
Spot. Spot!
Who are you?
Tess, Tess Mannering.
Where's Suzette?
You're Steve aren't you?
That's right, where's Suzette?
Come on in, she's upstairs.
She's sleeping?
Well she was till Spot woke us.
Wait, I'll get her.
Lib, wake up Lib!
He's downstairs.
Who, Spot?
No, Steve!
What do you mean?
I mean Steve, he's downstairs.
Tess, if this is a joke.
It's not, he's downstairs waiting for you.
Suzette!
What do I tell him?
Don't ask me.
Thanks.
I wonder how he found us.
I don't know.
The registration.
I bet he got it from his wife.
He probably knew how much trouble we'd be in without it.
No, now you stay here.
Can't I look at him from the top of the stairs?
Well, all right.
Steve?
Steve, are you in here?
Steve?
Steve, where are you?
Mr. Marak are you out there?
You're not Suzette.
You're just a kid.
Where is she?
Mr. Marak, I pretended to be Suzette.
I'm Libby Mannering.
You pretended?
It was a game, we called people on the telephone just for fun.
Steve?
This is Suzette, I saw what you did, and I know who you are.
It was just a game.
You said you saw what
I did, what did you see?
Nothing, nothing.
That was just part of the game.
But you knew who I was, knew my name, how did you find that?
Well in the telephone book.
We just picked any name.
I put peanut butter and jelly on it, that's how we found it.
We called lots of other people too.
We said the same thing to all of them.
I'm really sorry Mr. Marak, we shouldn't have done it.
But I tried to explain to your wife that it was just a joke.
Did she give you the registration card?
You know what I should do?
Tell your parents.
Oh no, no please, please don't do that.
You must want this awful bad huh?
Oh I sure do.
You don't know what a mess
I'll be in if I don't get it.
My wife was pretty upset.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right,
I calmed her down.
Well there's no use making a federal case out of a silly prank, hmm?
Here.
Oh, just one thing, don't use the phone for fun and games anymore.
Good night, and thank you.
Hello?
Libby?
Kit, you'll never guess.
I told you everything would be all right.
You see, all your worrying was for nothing.
I hate to say I told you so.
I've got it, Mommy's registration card.
No he brought it here.
Steve Marak was there?
Mm-hmm!
He didn't want us to get in any trouble.
Oh thank goodness, is he still there?
No he's gone, but he sure had me scared.
I would've been scared too, what did he look like?
Well he was kinda tall.
He had brown hair.
He was older than we thought, about 40.
Oh Libby this is real weird.
Wait till I tell you, a woman was murdered tonight,
I heard it on the radio, some girl saw the man who did it, she saw the murderer
Libby, and he was tall, had dark hair and middle-aged.
I saw what you did, and I know who you are.
And look it happened at 8:30, just when we started calling, isn't that a weird coincidence?
I mean kooky!
Oh it's my dad, I have to hang up.
Kit?
Kit?
This is the operator.
Operator, give me the police, okay?
Tess, get UP!
Tess, where are you?
Tess!
Tess, where are you?
Tess!
Libby hide, he's coming after you!
Tess, get out of the house, run for help!
Oh Tess!
Tess, where are you?
Tess, Tess?
Here I am Libby...
The car!
Get to the car!
Libby, Libby, Libby...
She's lucky you called this in time Mr. Austin.
She's lucky my daughter finally told me the truth.
I wasn't scared, really scared I mean.
But Daddy's gonna be mad.
That man broke our window and pulled out the telephone.
You're such an idiot.
They can fix the window.
But we're not gonna be using the phone for a long, long time.
Sorry, you have reached a disconnected number.
We’re almost there, honey. Just a little while longer and your vacation starts.
I’m getting cold, mother, and hungry.
We should be pretty close right now, the agent said it was about
12 miles from highway 10, and that was highway 10, back there.
But you know we should’ve asked for better directions at the last gas station.
Listen, I’ve never gotten us lost before.
Mommy, I’m cold.
Okay, Debbie, I’ll put the top up.
Never mind, Mike.
Debbie can come up and sit between us.
Now, that’s better, baby.
Why don’t we sing a song to help pass the time?
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream
Row, row, row your boat
All right, mister.
I see you have a tail light problem.
No excuse – running late, first vacation, kid getting tired.
It’s too bad.
Well, can’t you give us a break, officer?
Well, all right, all right.
Sure do appreciate it.
We are running kind of late.
Okay, but if you’re running late, you should’ve started earlier.
Anyhow, no tail light.
Have it fixed.
Thank you, officer.
Ten miles up this road.
We’re almost there, Debbie.
Just a few minutes more.
- I wonder where they’re going.
- Man, like, there’s nothing up that road.
Now look, the sign pointed this way.
Mike, let’s go back to the crossroads and ask those kids we saw.
Okay, okay, but I know we can’t be wrong.
Look, the sign pointed this way.
How many times do we have to chase you kids?
Oh, shit.
Holy cow, man.
You think we’re doing something wrong.
Well, whatever it is you’re not doing, go don’t do it somewhere else.
Why don’t you guys leave us alone?
Come on, now. No wisecracks.
Just go on home.
Okay.
- Get going, get going.
- All right already.
I could have sworn we didn’t make a wrong turn.
You must have.
- Where did the road go?
- No need to get upset. We’ll find it.
Where did this place come from?
It wasn’t here a few minutes ago.
I don’t care. Let’s see if we can get some directions.
Look, there’s someone at the door.
I am Torgo. I take care of the place while the Master is away.
But the child – I’m not sure the Master would approve, or the dog.
The Master doesn’t like children.
We only want to know where Valley Lodge is.
Which way do we go?
There’s no place like that around here.
Mike, I’m scared.
It’s getting dark.
Well, Torgo, which way is out of here?
There is no way out of here.
It will be dark soon.
There is no way out of here.
No way out?
Well, you know, we could spend the night here, and then tomorrow...
Oh, Mike, Mike...
I-I don’t want to spend the night here,
I don’t like the looks of the place.
Well, it seems we have no alternative.
Well, how about it, Torgo, can we spend the night here?
Well, I don’t know what else we can do.
But Mike, I don’t wanna stay here.
And the Master wouldn’t approve.
Don’t worry about it, we’re here now, and I’m sure the Master won’t throw us out.
Well? How about it, Torgo?
I don’t wanna stay!
Let’s leave!
I don’t know about it.
I just don’t know.
Daddy, I’m cold. Let’s go in.
Well, Torgo, in or out?
Patient, dear.
Very well.
The Master will be very disturbed.
I’ll get the luggage.
Torgo, we’ll stay tonight, and then tomorrow...
You must be...
You cannot stay.
The Master would not approve.
See? You’re feeling better already.
Look at this.
Mike, I...
He looks so sinister.
Must be the Master himself.
Oh, Mike, I’m scared.
He has the meanest look.
And that dog...
I’d hate to run up on him in the dark, or even in the light, for that matter.
That must be your Master.
What did you say he was?
He has left this world, but he is with us always – no matter where we go, he is with us.
- What?
- No matter where he goes?
What does that mean?
And that dog... is the most vicious-looking animal I’ve ever seen.
Well, I hope he goes where the Master goes.
There is nothing to fear, madam.
The Master likes you.
Nothing will happen to you; he likes you.
Likes me?
I thought you said he was dead.
Dead? No, madam, not “dead” the way you know it.
He is with us always.
Not “dead” the way you know it.
He is with us always.
Mike, I don’t like this.
Nothing to worry about, it’s only your imagination.
I think that it’s best that I show you to the bedroom, now.
Oh, my God!
Mike, what was that?
Probably some animal in the desert.
Nothing to be afraid of.
I’m scared, Mike.
Michael, I don’t care what it is, chase it away.
Okay, if it will make you relax,
I’ll go out and see what it is.
What happened? I heard...
Stay here. Get back into the house.
Get back in the house, damnit!
My God, Mike! What happened?
He’s dead. Peppie’s been killed.
Get back in the house, honey.
Mike, what kind of place is this?
My God, what kind of place is this?
I’ll take care of everything, honey.
Get back in the house.
Mike...
Oh, Mike, what could’ve done it?
Honey, it was probably some animal from the desert.
This place must be full of them.
Peppie...
He went away, baby.
Went away while you were asleep.
Mike, I wanna leave this place.
Now.
Okay, honey. We’ll leave right away.
Where the hell is that caretaker?
Torgo!
Torgo!
Did you want me?
We’re leaving. Would you mind putting the luggage back into the car?
As you wish.
Right now.
Fast, damnit! Fast!
I’ll be glad to leave,
I’ve had all this place I want.
Madam, it would be very dangerous to leave now.
The Master wants you.
Wants me?
What kind of talk is that?
He wants you for his wife.
He loves beautiful women.
Don’t you ever try that again, you... beast!
The Master wants you, but he can’t have you.
I want you!
Stop that talk this instance, you hear?
He wants you, but he can’t have you.
Mike! Mike!
Where in the world can he be?
Mike! Mike!
Let me out of here.
Let me out of here, now!
Do you hear? Now!
Forgive me, madam.
I meant no harm.
Forgive you?
Just wait till I tell my husband!
I meant no harm, madam.
I’ll protect you.
I will protect you.
Very well, I won’t tell my husband.
Now let me out.
Imagine, the damned car won’t start.
Margaret?
Damned car won’t start.
Well, that really fixes things.
What are we gonna do now?
I don’t know, and I couldn’t find anything wrong with it, either.
Hey, Torgo, where’s the phone?
Yes, Alexander Graham Bell, you know, telephone?
There is none, sir. The Master doesn’t approve of such devices.
Then where is the nearest phone?
The nearest phone is at the crossroads.
That’s ten miles.
Ten miles?
Might as well be 10,000 miles!
Easy, honey. It won’t help to get mad.
The Master won’t mind you staying tonight.
He has no choice – we can’t leave, we can’t walk out of here, and the damned car won’t start.
I’ll just bring the bags back to the room.
Sinister.
“Sinister” isn’t descriptive enough.
Honey, we’ll leave in the morning, and soon this place will be forgotten.
Forgotten? I’ll never forget.
Peppie’s gone.
I just hope Debbie will understand.
She’ll understand.
She’s my baby, she’ll understand.
I hope so, darling. I sure hope so.
She’s my baby, she’ll understand.
Say, where is she?
Oh, my God! Michael!
Don’t get wrought up, she’s probably playing hide-and-seek.
Okay, Debbie, we see you.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Maybe she slipped into one of the rooms.
Debbie?
- Debbie?
- Debbie?
Debbie?
Torgo, have you seen Debbie?
- No.
- She’s gone. Help us find her.
She couldn’t have gone outside; the door is bolted.
For God’s sake, don’t panic!
She’s got to be in here.
Is there another exit to the outside?
In the kitchen.
That door is bolted, too!
Outside, Mike.
She’s got to be outside.
All right, we’ll look outside for her.
- Debbie?
- Debbie?
- Debbie?
- Debbie?
Mike, I’m scared.
- The animals and Debbie...
- Cut it out!
We’ll find her. Don’t worry.
Debbie?
Debbie?
Daddy, is this a good puppy?
Mike, it’s the dog from the portrait.
Stand back, Debbie! Stand back!
That dog wants to play with you, daddy.
Darling, baby, you could’ve been hurt.
I saw the puppy and got close to.
But you should never run away from us.
Debbie, don’t ever run away from us.
But I wanna find my puppy.
Where did you find the new dog, baby?
In that big place.
In a big place? Where, Debbie?
There was this big dark place.
It was so dark, but I wasn’t afraid of the dark, there were all kinds of funny people in it.
Where is the place, Debbie?
Follow me, daddy.
Mike, it’s horrible!
- Let’s get out of here!
- Let’s go!
Get into the bedroom and lock yourself in.
I’m gonna find Torgo.
He’s got some explaining to do.
Hurry. Please hurry.
I want her.
She’s mine! Mine! Mine, you hear?
I want this one. You have all the wives you need. This one is mine.
Look!
Oh, you pretty ones.
No matter how good you are,
I won’t need you anymore.
I have my own wife!
I won’t have to come in here to dream of having one of you.
You... You are the worst!
You were his first wife.
He doesn’t want you anymore.
And now even I don’t want you.
No, I’m through with all of you.
Through!
Through, you hear me?
Again? How many times do you have to be told?
Like, wow!
Have a heart, will you?
Go chase that other couple.
What other couple?
Those idiots that went deeper in the desert.
Find them and queue on them a while.
We know that this road goes nowhere, so now get!
No smart stuff.
We ain’t trying to jump on you.
Just get!
O Manos...
Thou of primal darkness!
Thou, who dwelleth in the depths of the universe, in the black chasms of night!
Thou, who bestoweth the mother darkness upon thy faithful, to live eternally in her keeping.
Thou dost make him most blessed forever!
And thou who dost curse with eternal burning life those who transgress against thee!
Holy art thou, holy art thou, holy art thou!
Manos will be done!
Thy priesthood remains steadfast, thy priesthood remains constant, thy priesthood remains righteous.
Thou hast taught us, o Manos, and we hath listened.
Give ear to our words, o Manos, and hear us!
Hear us!
Hear us!
For we are faithful and thou art our God.
Arise, my wives.
Give ear to the words of Manos.
Arise, my wives, and hear the will of Manos.
Why has the child been brought here?
Why?
And a female child at that!
I have never complained about sacrificing a man, but a child?
The woman is all we want.
The others must die.
They all must die!
We do not even want the woman.
They child is a female – she must not be destroyed.
She will grow up to be a woman.
- She must be killed!
- No!
I’m the oldest of the wives, and it is my privilege to say that...
Enough!
Enough of this stupid bickering!
The child must die!
If you persist in this foolishness, your usefulness will come to an end.
Say what you will,
I will have no part of this madness.
As the oldest of the wives,
I demand that she lives.
I don’t know what they’re doing here in the first place.
You have caused enough trouble.
I think perhaps your service to us is at its end, now.
Silence! Silence!
And now, my wives, I shall deal with the one who is responsible for the child being here.
Torgo, he’s the one!
Get Torgo!
You are responsible for this nonsense.
We shall dispose of you, later.
It’s a terrible mistake.
The man, yes. The child, no.
Maybe she’s right.
Maybe we should spare the child.
It is against our will that we stay here.
Do not make the child die to satisfy him.
He does not need any more wives.
Yes, he has no more time for us older wives, just the newest.
Jealousy is not part of us.
Why are you so jealous of me?
You are a troublemaker.
You deserve to die!
Die? I may die, but I do not care.
The child must live.
She is right.
We will not kill the child.
But Manos would not approve.
The law of Manos exits for us only.
Manos loves women.
She will grow up to be a woman.
She must die.
When the Master hears of this, he will be furious.
You are all mad! Mad, the whole lot of you!
The man, yes. The child, no.
Master, what are you doing here?
You have failed us, Torgo.
I know of your visits to the tomb.
My visits?
The women have told me.
They may not be able to say anything, or move when you’re there, but they remember everything you say to them, and everything you do to them.
But Master, you have six wives.
Why can’t I have one for myself?
You’re not one of us, therefore you cannot have one of them.
But I have one now.
This one is mine. You’ll never get her.
You have failed us, Torgo.
For this you must die!
Failed you? No.
You have failed yourselves.
You’ll never kill them!
I’ll help them!
You have failed... and you must die!
Manos, God of primal darkness, as thou has decreed, so have I done.
The hands of fate have doomed this man.
Thy will is done.
The women are fighting!
What was that?
Michael?
Michael, where are you?
Oh, please, God! Where is Mike?
Stop! What foolishness is this?
Manos must be served!
There you are!
She is the one!
She has upset all of our plans!
This foolishness must stop!
There has been enough trouble.
Our purpose must be served.
There will be no further insolence.
- But the child...
- We cannot kill a child!
Yes, we can!
You have caused enough trouble!
As soon as we have disposed of Torgo, we shall take care of you!
Your power fails you; I have no more fear.
Seize her! And prepare her for sacrifice!
Well done, my wives.
The will of Manos shall be served!
Tis the will of Manos that he be sacrificed.
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Manos has decreed it.
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Mike, help us! Oh, my God!
Margaret, open the door!
Margaret, open the door!
Enough!
The ceremony is done.
Killing doesn’t help anymore!
You’re all finished!
You have said enough!
Your turn will come, as soon as we’ve disposed of the others!
Go find the others!
Hurry, before the night slips away!
At the window, Mike.
I saw him at that window.
Okay, honey. We’ll leave. We’ll leave.
We’ve got to leave now!
I can’t stand it any longer!
Please, Mike!
We’ll hide in the desert.
Someone will help.
The gods will destroy you!
Your power fails!
You cannot endure!
Destroy?
The gods destroy me?
Destroy me?
I am permanent!
Manos has made me permanent!
Your power fails you!
You are losing your control!
Even Torgo defied you!
And he was destroyed, even as you shall be!
Your power does not affect me anymore!
Even your other wives do not trust you!
See? I do not fear you!
Eventhough you beat me!
Beat me again! Beat! Beat!
I do not fear you!
I can’t go on.
Take Debbie and run.
No, darling. We’ll make it.
Let’s go.
Nothing of that way.
Let’s go this way.
Mike? Mike, are you all right?
Damn...
Mike, we can’t go on this way.
We got to keep going.
They have gone!
They have left the house!
We have searched everywhere.
Find them!
They must not escape!
- Find them!
- No, leave them alone!
We cannot kill a child!
Enough talk!
Find them!
Manos will be served!
I can’t make it, Mike!
I can’t make it!
Take the baby!
Take Debbie!
No, Maggie, we can make it.
We’ll rest here for a minute.
We can make it.
Let’s go back.
They’ll never think of looking for us at the house.
You know, you might have a point there.
Please, Mike! Please!
I can’t go any farther!
Listen, we can lock ourselves in the kitchen. I have my gun.
We’ll have to go back.
Okay. It might be the safest place, especially since they’re out here, looking for us.
Daddy, I’m scared.
Where’s my puppy?
Please, Debbie, not now!
That sure sounded like shots.
We’d better check.
At this hour of the night? There can’t be anybody out here – this is the boondocks.
Well, sound does travel a long way at night.
It could be clear over in Mexico, for that matter.
It sure is good to get away.
Damn the rain!
Vacations are fine, but this one should be great.
Yeah, the gang’s coming up for the weekend. What a blast!
Welcome.
I am Michael.
I take care of the place while the Master is away.
Once upon a midnight dreary...
while I pondered, weak and weary...
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore...
while I nodded, nearly napping...
suddenly there came a tapping...
as of someone gently rapping...
rapping at my chamber door.
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered...
"Tapping at my chamber door...
"only this, and nothing more."
Distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December...
and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow...
vainly I had sought to borrow...
from my books surcease of sorrow...
sorrow for the lost Lenore...
for the rare and radiant maiden...
whom the angels name Lenore.
Nameless here forevermore.
And the silken sad uncertain rustling...
of each purple curtain thrilled me...
filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before.
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating...
"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door.
"Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door.
"This it is...
"and nothing more."
Lenore.
Come back to me, Lenore.
Come back to me.
I brought you your goblet of warm milk, father.
Yes, thank you, my dear.
She's been dead for over two years now, father.
You're young, Estelle.
The young do not understand grief.
To you she was only a stepmother, but to me, she was...
My life.
I'm sorry.
- Good night.
- Good night, my dear.
Come in.
Enter!
Well, upon my soul.
Do you want to come in?
I believe it does.
Well then, come on.
Who sent you to me?
Are you some dark, winged messenger from beyond?
Answer me, monster. Tell me truly... shall I ever hold again that radiant maiden... whom the angels call Lenore?
How the hell should I know?
What am I, a fortune-teller?
Oooo, I'm chilled to the bones.
Why don't you give me some wine?
Well, don't just stand there gaping at me.
That voice, I...
Will you give me some wine?
Yes. Yes!
Here's some nice hot milk.
Milk! How vomitable.
Surely this is a dream.
Hurry up, will you?
There you are.
What do you expect me to do... hold it?
With what?
Oh, never mind.
I like that.
Upon my soul.
Never mind your soul.
Start concentrating on getting me back to my rightful form.
Your rightful form?
Well what do you think?
I was born this way?
Well I... I have it.
You are under an enchantment.
Took you long enough to find that out.
Let's get to work.
Well go ahead. Do something.
But what?
Restore me to my rightful form.
I just don't know how.
Oh no... Well...
You got some dried blood of a bat in the house?
I beg your pardon.
Bat's blood.
Dried or evaporated bat's blood.
No.
How about some chain links from a gallows bird?
Jellied spiders? Rabbits' lard?
Dead-man's hair?
No. We don't keep those things in this house.
We're vegetarians.
And that calls himself a magician.
Honestly, this is too much.
- Just a moment.
- Yes?
Perhaps there are some of those staples... down in my father's old laboratory.
Well don't you know?
No. I haven't been down there... since he died, over twenty years ago.
Well, let's go and see.
I don't care to remain like this... for the rest of my life.
Oh, these feathers itch!
Do you mean to say that these things you requested... are going to turn you back into...
- What were you?
- Never mind.
Come on. Let's go.
Strange to be down here again, after all these years.
- How much further is it?
- Just a little way.
Now what is it you need?
Dried bat's blood.
Chain links from a gallows bird.
Rabbits' lard. Essence of...
Slowly, slowly.
One thing at a time, please.
Now what is it?
Nothing.
What's that?
Entrails of troubled horse.
No, no, put it back.
- What's that?
- I can't read it.
Well, look inside then.
What is it?
I'd rather not discuss it, if you don't mind.
You did say dead-man's hair?
Yes. That's one of the prime ingredients.
All right, let's get on with it.
All right, all right, that's enough stirring.
Now the tongue of a vulture.
Come on, come on.
You're the slowest magician I've ever seen.
It's a very difficult recipe.
Is that all there is of it?
You've got the jellied spiders in there?
Yes.
The eye of a white weasel?
Yes.
You didn't forget the dead-man's hair?
No.
Well that should do it, then.
Hand it over.
You're not going to drink it?
What did you think I was going to do?
Take a bath in it?
That's not so bad.
Dr. Craven?
Dr. Raven...
Dr. Bedlo.
Bedlo?
Don't you remember me? We met... at a sorcerer's convention lunch several years ago.
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Well, in any case, everything seems to have gone all right.
Yes.
Look! Look what you did to me.
Look what you did to me...
What I did to you?
Who else?
You made the potion, didn't you?
Yes, but it was your recipe.
My recipe was right.
There just wasn't enough of it.
Then all I can do is to make some more of it.
Well then go make some more!
All right. All right.
Let me see, now.
Jellied spiders... yes.
Here we are.
Evaporated bat's blood.
Or do you prefer dehydrated?
- I don't care.
- OK.
What a night. What a night!
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
- What is it now?
- Dead-man's hair.
- What about it?
- We're out of it.
- Well go get some more then.
- More? Where?
- Where?
In a graveyard. Where else?
Enter a graveyard at this time of night?
Despoil the dead?
No, you would rather see me go through life like this, would you?
No, of course not.
Oh, I am sorry.
Let's go to the graveyard.
That won't be necessary, you see... my father is in the family crypt... and I don't think papa would mind... if I took just a snip or two... in a good cause.
Why should he mind?
Yes, you're right.
Let's be on our way.
How did you... come to find yourself in this awkward state?
It's a little embarrassing, but...
You've heard of
Dr. Scarabus, of course?
Scarabus? Heaven help us.
Was he the one who did this to you?
Who else?
How did it come about?
I invited myself to his castle for dinner.
Of course, as a member of the brotherhood... of magicians and sorcerers... and Scarabus is the grand master.
You have heard of the brotherhood?
Oh yes.
Yes.
My father was its grand master for twenty-seven years... with Scarabus a rival for his power... every moment of the time.
I didn't know that.
Yes. It's precisely because... of the painful memories of those years that... well, that I never saw fit to join the brotherhood.
Tell me, if your father was grand master... then by direct line of ascension... you could claim the mastership for yourself.
Oh, no. Heaven forbid, no.
No, I prefer to practice my magic quietly at home.
But you were telling me how it happened.
Oh, it was the result of too much wine.
I became abusive and... then I became critical of his abilities.
Yes?
And then I challenged him to a duel.
Of magic?
Well, the whole thing was completely unfair.
I was just getting my magical equipment ready, and then... all he did was a few gestures in the air with his hands.
You mean, he... only used his hands?
Yes. What of it?
Then his skill is far greater than I ever had dreamed of.
Far greater? He was cheating.
Oh no. No, Dr. Bedlo.
Magic by gesture of the hands is the most advanced sorcery.
I don't agree with you at all.
I can't agree.
If I would have been sober... which I admit doesn't happen very often, but... it would have been an entirely different story... entirely different.
And I'll get my revenge on him yet. You'll see.
With all my heart, sir, I tell you... do not go back there.
Hard place to keep clean, huh?
Yes. I very seldom get down here.
Thank you.
Ouch!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Forgive me, papa.
Beware.
What did he say?
He... He told me to... to beware.
- Of what?
- I don't know.
I suggest we'd better leave here.
Yes.
Don't forget my hair.
Come on, hurry up!
Come on.
Beware!
A little unexpected, what happened down there.
Yes, it was most unexpected.
I just don't understand.
Why should my father return from the dead... and then tell me to beware? Of what?
I wish I knew.
I-I-I wish I knew.
Yes.
That milk.
Oh, I am sorry.
In any case, I have to return... to the castle of
Dr. Scarabus tonight.
No. Sir, please, I beg you.
I implore you.
Do not go back there.
But he has confiscated all my magical equipment.
- And I want revenge.
- But he is too powerful.
Then come with me.
No. No, I want nothing to do with him... nothing at all.
No?
What's the picture of that woman doing here?
That woman?
That woman, sir, was my wife.
- Left you, huh?
- Certainly not.
Then what was she doing with Dr. Scarabus?
What?
But that's impossible, sir.
She's been dead for over two years.
- I saw her there.
- When?
- This evening.
- No.
Oh, no.
I keep her here.
Where else? May I?
Thank you.
But I'd...
I'd swear I saw her there this evening.
No.
No, you saw someone else.
It was her.
No. That's not possible.
Unless...
Unless what?
Unless Scarabus has gained control of her spirit.
But why?
To take his revenge on the house of Craven.
No. This profanation must be ended.
Then you're coming with me?
Yes, I must go with you... for the sake of Lenore's tormented soul.
And don't forget my magical equipment.
No.
- You rang, sir?
- Yes, Grimes.
Prepare the coach for immediate departure.
Yes, sir.
And you're going to need something... to protect you from the cold.
No, I meant clothes!
Oh...
In here.
I think this one will...
No, I despise black lately.
Oh, yes. Sorry.
What about this red one here?
Well it's a little gaudy, but...
I like that.
That's beautiful. Thank you.
It's a little long, isn't it?
Yes. I'm sorry.
Here, let's try this.
Yes, that's nice. Thank you.
The sleeves are a little long, but...
Yes, but I can hold them.
It'll keep you warm.
- That's nice. I like that.
- There you are.
You really should wear a hat.
Thank you.
That's very considerate of you.
But I can't see through that.
That's meant to be a scarf, doctor, you see? There.
But I don't want to be...
I don't want to be choked to death by a head...
I'm sorry. Here, try this one.
I don't like the material.
Well, then this?
That's nice. That matches this green, doesn't it?
A little too large, isn't it?
Yes. Here, try this one.
Really, anything will do.
That's fine.
Father?
Yes, my dear.
You're going out at this hour?
Yes, I am, my dear. Doctor.
Dr. Bedlo, this is my daughter, Estelle.
Dr. Bedlo.
Enchante, m'selle.
- Where are you going, father?
- Well, I can't tell you, Estelle.
It's something dangerous, isn't it?
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Shall we go, doctor?
- I'm going with you.
- No, you most certainly are not.
- But, father...
- Don't worry, my dear.
Nothing too bad is going to happen.
Just trust me.
Doctor!
Father!
Father!
Father!
Father, wake up!
Don't leave us!
It's every man for himself!
Erasmus, wake up.
- Why aren't you doing something?
- Why don't you do something?
Without my equipment...
- Are you all right, my dear?
- Father.
Tell me, how did you do that?
That? Oh, it was nothing worthy of note.
What do you mean, nothing worthy?
It was the most spectacular thing I've ever seen.
Thank you.
No, Dr. Bedlo.
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened, you... you maniac! You idiot!
What did happen, Grimes?
I was on my way to the stable.
How did I get in here?
You don't remember coming in here?
Last thing I remember was something burning at my head.
- Burning?
- Burning.
Never mind, Grimes.
It's not important.
You go and prepare the carriage.
What do you mean, it's not important?
He almost killed us.
- That will be all, Grimes.
- Yes, sir.
You're letting him go?
But can't you see? He has no idea of what happened.
Clearly, he was the victim of some diabolic mind control.
That's nonsense.
- Scarabus?
- Scarabus?
Yes, my dear.
Yes, it is to his castle that I must go.
I am going with you, then.
But she can't help us.
But what other choice do I have?
What if Scarabus should attack again?
Well I... I better get something, too... because I don't want to catch a cold.
Hold this for me.
This is my son Rexford.
This is Dr. Craven... and that's his daughter...
What's her name?
- Estelle.
- Mademoiselle Estelle.
Enchante, ma chere.
Doesn't he speak beautiful French?
- Yes.
- Now get out of here.
But, father, I've been looking for you.
That's all right, but leave now because we are in a hurry.
- What about mother?
- What about her?
- She wants you home.
- Why?
I don't know, but she gave me strict instructions... that once I found you, not to let you out of my sight.
Don't do that, Rexford.
Dr. Bedlo, we must be on our way now.
Yes, we are in a hurry.
If you do that once more...
I'll smash you one right in the face!
- Dr. Bedlo, please.
- He's my son!
Yes, I know, but we must go.
- Then I must go with you.
- Yes, certainly. Certainly.
Maybe you want to bring your friends with you?
Maybe you want to have a family outing, huh?
Bring your own mother.
I'm sure Dr. Scarabus... would be delighted to have your mother.
- Dr. Scarabus?
- Yes, that's where we're going.
You are not going to let him drive.
I don't like to, but if he doesn't, who will?
I'd be glad to drive, sir.
That's very nice of you, young man.
- Grimes, you can stay here.
- Yes, sir.
Estelle?
Father, mayn't I ride up there?
You know how ill it makes me to sit inside.
Yes, yes, of course.
Good-bye, sir.
That's a fine boy you have.
Does he favor his mother?
She favors him.
Thank you.
"I'd be glad to drive, sir."
Idiot!
What was that about your coachman before?
Oh, when he went out to the stable to prepare the coach... something happened to him.
Father said that he was obviously the victim... of some diabolical mind control.
Whatever it was, the look on his face was hideous... his eyes glittering like those of a maniac... his lips drawn back, and his teeth clenched tight... his breath harsh and rapid.
Don't you think we'd better go a little slower?
Father!
Now what is this idiot doing?
What's the matter with you?
I'm talking to you, Rexford!
Help!
He looks as crazy as your coachman did.
What?
Why don't you do something?
Some magic or something?
And leave the coach without a driver?
Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Are you all right?
There it is.
What?
Shouldn't we better go in there alone?
To what avail, sir?
Obviously Scarabus' powers of magic... are not confined within the walls of his castle.
That's right.
Why don't you go in?
R-R-Rexford, you go ahead.
There's no one here.
Hey!
You do something!
Let's get out of here.
No.
No, we haven't come this far to... retreat at the first obstacle.
Dr. Scarabus?
Dr. Scarabus?
A cozy little place, huh?
I'm afraid. Father, I...
Afraid, my dear?
There's nothing to be afraid of.
I bid you welcome, one and all.
You are Dr. Craven, are you not?
How happy I am to meet you after all these years.
The son of Roderick Craven in my home at last.
Your father and I were great friends, you know.
Friends?
But who is this delightful creature?
Well, she...
No, no, no. Tell me nothing.
Of course, I can see the lineage is clear.
She is your daughter
Estelle, is she not?
Yes.
Thrice welcome to the home of Dr. Scarabus, my child.
How enchanting you are.
And this fine young fellow... surely not your son, dear doctor?
I am Dr. Bedlo's son.
I am sorry.
Yes, the resemblance is quite uncanny.
But what happy circumstance brings you to my home... dear doctor?
The spirit of my late wife.
The spirit, sir? Late wife?
I'm afraid I do not understand you.
Dr. Bedlo has informed me that...
Very discreetly.
That he saw my wife Lenore within these walls.
Is it true, sir?
Have you her soul in bondage?
Dr. Craven, I am shocked... truly shocked that you should harbor... such an appalling thought about me.
You've wounded me to the heart.
But if it is not true... then why did you try to prevent our arrival?
I did not try to prevent your arrival.
But, sir, we thought...
What are you doing?
Summoning forth the truth.
Lenore.
Lenore!
You rang, sir?
That's not my...
There is your spirit, sir.
You may go.
My apologies, Dr. Scarabus, for having wronged you.
How can I express my sorrow at this gross misunderstanding?
But please, sir, join me at the table.
A little food and wine and conversation.
Let us not part on such a somber note.
You will make this kindly gesture... for an old man's sake?
Yes, yes. Of course.
My gratitude knows no bounds.
Dr. Bedlo, young sir.
On my right, Dr. Craven, if you will.
Your lovely daughter next to you.
Dr. Bedlo, on my left, if you please.
All right.
But don't think I have forgotten... what happened earlier this evening.
But, sir, I hoped you had forgotten.
That you turned me into a raven?
A raven?
But, sir, you tried to kill me.
So what?
Well, under the circumstances...
I feel I behaved with great leniency.
I knew that presently... you would find some way to restore yourself... and, lo, you have, and all is well again.
And you didn't try to stop us from coming here?
Have I not yet convinced you of my sincerity?
Come. Eat, drink.
Let me enjoy one full hour of fine conviviality... with the son of my old friend.
I'm sorry, sir... but my father never gave me the impression... that you and he were anything but mortal enemies.
Oh, doctor. Competitors, yes.
Contestants if you like, but enemies? No.
I admired him more than any other man.
Oh I... I see.
And yet, it...
It always appeared that...
Appeared, dear doctor.
You and I of the occult dedication... know only too well the deceptiveness... of what appears to be.
Yes, that is true.
That is quite true.
But tell me now, tell me something... of your miraculous hand manipulations... of which I've heard such wondrous accounts... and yet have never witnessed.
But I have already seen that you, too... possess the gift of magic by gesture.
I have my humble means.
Humble?
Humble he calls it... turning people into birds.
Are you still talking about that?
The incident is closed.
It is not!
Where is my bag of magical equipment?
- In a safe place.
- Give it back to me.
Gladly, doctor... if you will but give me your promise not to...
I promise nothing! I challenge you!
Again?
Dr. Bedlo.
Shut your mouth!
I know you.
You're afraid to face me when I'm sober, huh?
Are you sober?
Sober enough to make a fool of you, you cheap faker, you.
Father.
Dr. Bedlo.
That I did not hear.
We will proceed with our present conversation.
Yes, you are afraid, you miserable coward.
- Father, in the name of...
- Shut your mouth!
Yes, afraid.
Afraid of an honest duel in magic... you pitiful old goat.
- Enough, sir.
- You shriveled-up old...
Enough, sir. What am I to do?
Can't you decide for yourself?
Proceed.
Now!
Now we shall see who is the master of all magicians.
Can you not stop him?
I will do what I can, sir, but... as you see, he seems bent upon revenge.
Now!
Father, you mustn't do this.
Who are you to talk to me like that?
Father, you are in no condition...
Get back to the table!
Father, suppose he turns you into a raven.
That's none of your business!
Now...
Veni... Vedi...
Vici!
Ow!
You're defending yourself, you coward, huh?
All right, take this.
Oh you... You dirty old man.
All right...
I'll give you my Promethean magic.
In that, I am unexcelled.
Be easy on him.
I'll do my very best.
Caveat canem!
Caveat canem.
Oh, dear.
He really shouldn't have tried... for that particular experiment.
It requires such enormous concentration.
Oh, dear.
Raspberry jam.
If I might suggest,
I think perhaps your daughter... should lie down and rest awhile, dear doctor.
- The shock of all this.
- We must leave now, father.
Leave? Oh, no.
The storm is much too violent.
Wait till morning, dear child.
Then leave... refreshed.
Good night, Estelle.
Keep your door locked.
I will. Good night, father.
Good night.
I was afraid you'd scream.
Is anything wrong?
Don't be alarmed... but I'm afraid Dr. Scarabus killed my father.
Killed him?
Yes, during the dueling...
I observed Dr. Scarabus making furtive gestures... with his fingers.
Now we must speak to your father.
But I already have.
He trusts Dr. Scarabus.
We'll have to try it.
It's locked.
What will we do?
What are you doing?
This ledge leads to your father's room.
But you might be killed.
I hope not.
Lenore!
Lenore?
Lenore!
Did you have to make the weather so cold?
Did you have to see him?
Well I was curious.
I wanted to have a look at him as long as he was here.
As long as you couldn't kill him on the way.
How was I to know that you wanted Erasmus here?
You never tell me anything.
Besides, I thought he might find out about me... and make an unpleasant scene.
Would you undo me, please?
Your hands are so cold.
I'm always fascinated by your utter lack of scruples.
You knew what you were getting.
Did I ever pretend that I came here... because of your charm?
I came here because of your wealth and your power... and in return I gave you my company.
And if you insist on anything more... you will only succeed in boring me... whereupon I shall leave you as I left Erasmus.
How, my darling treasure?
By making me think that you have died?
Hardly.
Tell me, my... precious viper... how did you know that he was coming here... since, as you pointed out so petulantly...
I never tell you anything?
I didn't, at first.
I only guessed... after you turned that dismal little fat man into a blackbird.
A raven, my love.
Whatever.
I knew he wouldn't go for help... to a magician who was in the brotherhood.
Of course!
And that left only Dr. Craven.
How deftly nimble is your mind.
Why were you so sure that Bedlo would see... a portrait of me in Erasmus' house?
If you wanted Erasmus here... wasn't it a rather farfetched way of bringing him here?
After more than two years with me, dear Lenore... do you still think I make my plans in a farfetched way... leave anything to chance?
What do you mean?
Come with me and see.
Let go!
And don't sit on my chest, you...
I'm not an armchair, you idiot!
Come on, help me up.
Help me.
Don't look at me like that.
- What am I, a ghost?
- But I saw you killed!
Can't you speak quietly, you idiot?
I just wanted Scarabus to think that I was dead... so I could help if he moved against any of you.
- He already has.
- Has what?
Just now, I almost killed myself coming from Miss Craven's room.
She's locked in.
What are you doing in a lady's room?
Father, that's beside the point.
I decide what's beside the point!
All right, I went there to warn her... if you must know.
Dr. Scarabus has imprisoned her.
Imprisoned her?
Then we must get her out.
But what about her father?
Never mind!
I'll take care of her father!
Let's hide there.
Now, you wait here... and as soon as Scarabus passes, get the girl out of her room... and get her out of here.
But what about you?
Never mind me. Do as I tell you... for once in your life.
Well...
I think it's very rude to keep your guests waiting.
Thank heaven you're all right.
- Quickly, Estelle.
- Where are we going?
- Out of here.
- Without my father?
- Estelle, we have to leave.
- Not without my father.
You sly old thing, you.
And what was his price?
Mine? A double value... superior magical knowledge... and through my death by lightning... freedom from overbearing women.
Well worth the cost of being turned into an insignificant bird.
To say nothing of luring
Dr. Craven to me.
Don't forget that, my love.
I can't imagine why you want him here.
It's not Craven I want.
It's his magic.
Father? Father, we must leave.
Leave?
Yes. I've been locked in my room.
Rexford had to let me out.
- What is it, father?
- I saw Lenore.
Please, my father said we had to go as soon as possible.
- Your father?
- Yes. He's still alive.
His death was a trick.
Now, please, we must go.
Very well.
Come along, Bedlo.
You're wasting time.
One moment. One moment.
I don't think you quite appreciate what I went through.
You should have warned me... that feathers are a very inadequate protection... for a poor raven on a cold December night.
I don't even want to mention the pin feathers.
They itch!
But you should have warned me about the hawks!
- Hawks?
- Yes, the hawks!
On my way over to Dr. Craven,
I was attacked three times.
And then when I got there I had to discover he didn't even know how to turn me back into a man.
A man?
If I wouldn't have known the formula myself...
I would still be a raven.
I liked you better that way.
Oh, I must find Dr. Bedlo.
But, sir, he told me not to...
And to top it off...
I'm nearly chopped to pieces by that insane coachman... and nearly killed by my own son!
Have you quite finished? You have.
It's time to separate
Dr. Craven from his secrets.
Are we going to have some torture?
That won't be necessary.
I have his daughter.
Daughter?
That's a... That's a very good idea.
You really think so, do you?
What are you going to do?
Come.
Hurry, father!
Congratulations, Dr. Scarabus!
What are you doing now?
Hey, what are you doing with your cheap tricks?
Is that how you reward my services to you?
You ungrateful hellhound!
Fear not.
You will receive your just reward.
Not quite ready.
Can't you get your hands free, father?
I'm afraid not, my dear... what with Dr. Scarabus having turned me into a statue... and then binding me like this.
I know I...
I know I'm a disgrace.
I had a somewhat stronger word in mind.
But, son, you know that... that everything I've tried in life...
I was a failure.
Only...
Only the day I joined the brotherhood of magicians.
Oh I... I was the happiest man on earth.
I still remember how happy I was.
And then when Dr. Scarabus offered to teach me... superior magical knowledge for luring Dr. Craven here...
I just couldn't resist that magnificent award.
But, Erasmus, believe me... with all my heart,
I regret what I did to you.
You are not alone in guilt, sir.
I, too, have failed at the task of living.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes. Yes.
Instead of facing life,
I turned my back on it.
I know now why my father resisted Scarabus... because he knew that one cannot fight evil by hiding from it.
Men like Scarabus thrive on the apathy of others.
He's thrived on mine, and that offends me.
By avoiding contact with the brotherhood...
I've given him freedom... to commit his atrocities unopposed.
You sure have.
I'm sorry.
Bravo, Erasmus.
A splendid dissertation.
Lenore!
Well... You still look the same.
So does the girl.
You're alive!
Very much alive.
Yes, so I see.
That was someone else's body in the casket.
I left you for Scarabus.
No.
What has Scarabus done to you?
Are you under a spell?
Spell.
It's nothing but greed.
Speak to me, Lenore.
Speak to me, my beloved.
Erasmus, you're still just as much a bore as ever.
Well now, gentlemen,
I think we are ready to begin.
I'm not ready.
No? You disagree?
Dr. Scarabus...
I'll do anything you want.
Just don't hurt me.
Father!
Come on, let me go.
But what about the others?
What others? I don't care what you do with them.
Dr. Bedlo...
I don't care if you turn me into a raven.
I don't care if you send me out into the cold night.
I don't care about the hawks and pin feathers.
Anything!
Anything is better than death!
Might be more amusing.
You really don't care what happens to your friends?
No. Why should I?
Such perfection of treachery fills me with admiration.
Since Dr. Craven will never have the opportunity of helping you again.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So farewell to Dr. Bedlo... as he flaps away to his well-deserved oblivion.
Gort.
Now, dear doctor... we'll take your charming daughter outside.
No! Father!
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
I wonder.
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Estelle!
Estelle!
Scarabus, you maniac!
Father! Father!
Somebody help me!
Estelle!
Dr. Craven...
Oh, for my hands. My hands!
Now, dear doctor,
I offer you a choice.
The secret of your hand manipulations... or this against this.
Don't tell him, father!
I'd rather die than have you tell him!
Is that your wish, too, dear doctor?
You didn't run... I mean, fly away?
Is that what you thought?
What else was I supposed to think?
All right, all right. Never mind.
You always did think like your mother.
We're wasting time, doctor.
Perhaps the sight of your daughter's flesh being seared... will clarify your thinking.
Now do something right for a change.
Your final...
Enough. This is no answer.
Is there an answer, then, Dr. Scarabus?
Yes.
A duel to the death.
Reconcile yourself to it, doctor.
One of us must perish.
Very well, then.
A duel to the death.
Erasmus!
Erasmus, darling!
The moment you defeated him...
I felt as if a great cloud had been lifted from my mind.
I'm free from his control.
Take me home.
- Well I...
- Father.
Personally, I think...
And that's enough out of you.
Yes, you're right, Estelle.
We can go home now.
Come along, young man.
Erasmus, what is it?
No, Erasmus, you don't understand!
Scarabus had me under his control!
I didn't know what I was doing!
No! Erasmus!
- You can't do this to me!
- Lenore.
So the grand master's been defeated.
Look at my dress!
Can't you do anything right?
All right, darling, hold still.
I'll attend to that for you.
Now, hold still.
Now look what you've done!
You've destroyed it!
I'm afraid I just don't have it anymore.
Thank you, my dear.
Good night, children.
Erasmus.
Now that Scarabus is out of the way... we've got to make immediate plans... for your assumption of the grand mastership.
I'll be glad to act as your liaison... so you won't be bothered having to present your case... personally to the brotherhood.
Later on, I'll be happy to assume the post... of supernumerary, secretary and dispenser...
- Dr. Bedlo.
- Yes?
Do you really think that such treachery... can be so easily forgiven and forgotten?
Treachery?
I saved all your lives.
After having put them in jeopardy in the first place.
That's beside the point.
Very well.
If that's the way you feel about it... kindly return me to my rightful form, and I'll leave.
Well, I'll...
I'll take it under advisement.
Take it under advisement?
Well, really.
Who do you think you're talking to, anyway?
- Up.
- What's that?
- Up.
- Now wait a minute, Erasmus.
- Up!
- Really!
I never heard of such ingratitude in my entire life.
It's getting so you can't trust anybody anymore.
I'm just too sweet and gentle.
That's my trouble.
- Dr. Bedlo.
- What is it?
Shut your beak.
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."
Bring out Elizabeth Selwyn.
Bring out the witch! Bring out the witch!
Bring her out! Bring her out!
Witch!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!
Jeth row! Jeth row!
Jeth row!
Jethrow Keane, hast thou consorted with the witch, Elizabeth Selwyn?
No.
Burn the witch!
No! No!
Please!
No!
No! No! No! No! No!
Help her, O Lucifer, help her.
Elizabeth Selwyn...
...on this third day of March, in the year of our Lord, 1692...
...we, the people of Whitewood,
Massachusetts, condemn thee as a witch.
May the flames cleanse thy soul of its evil.
Of its lust for blood that made thee bring about the death of Abigail Adams.
Help her, Lucifer, help her!
I have made my pact with thee,
O Lucifer. Hear me!
Hear me!
I will do thy bidding for all eternity.
For all eternity shall I practise the ritual of Black Mass.
- Lucifer.
- For eternity shall I sacrifice unto thee.
I can feel my soul taking me to thy service.
O Lucifer, listen to thy servant.
Grant her this pact for all eternity, and I with her, and if we fail thee but once, you may do with our souls what you will.
Make this city an example of thy vengeance.
Curse it.
- Curse it for all eternity.
- Curse?
And let me be the instrument of thy curse.
Hear me, O Lucifer.
Hear me!
She's making a curse.
Curse?
Burn her! Burn her!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Burn! Burn her!
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
"Burn, witch! Burn, witch!
Burn, burn, burn!"
So shouted the people of Whitewood when they burnt Elizabeth Selwyn in 1692.
Little is known today of the actual practices of witchcraft in 17th century New England.
Superstition, fear and jealousy drove the puritans to accuse their friends and relatives of consorting with the Devil.
Parading around huge bonfires, repeating vindictive chants, they consigned the poor creatures to the flames.
Their tortured souls cried out in agony as the flames mounted higher and higher.
"Burn, witch! Burn, witch! Burn, burn!"
- Dig that crazy beat.
- Shh!
That will be all for today.
Tomorrow will be my concluding lecture on witchcraft in 17th century New England.
I shall bring along some illustrations, which I'm sure will interest you all.
I'll bring the matches.
Maitland!
Since you chose to attend these lectures,
I had hope that it was in the spirit of scientific curiosity about the subject.
That'll be all.
- How could you?
- He takes it all so darn serious.
He's got you all hypnotised!
- Oh, Miss Barlow?
- Yes, Professor?
- Can I see you for a moment?
- Yes.
What about our date?
- Look, urn...
- I'll meet you.
I'll wait for you outside.
Yes, Professor.
Rather a difficult young man, that.
You're more than an attraction to him than my poor efforts.
I've been reading through your papers, Miss Barlow.
They show a very sound appreciation of the subject.
I want to go to New England to do my senior paper.
Mm-hm. They're really quite good, you know.
Well, I'm not quite satisfied with them yet.
I feel like I need some first-hand research.
I wanna get the atmosphere.
Find out how widespread witchcraft really was, what the witches were really like.
- That might take a little time.
- Well, I have the time.
My brother and I were gonna spend our vacation with our cousins.
What I'd really like to do is to get a room in the smallest, oldest town in New England I can find.
Check through all the town hall records.
Recheck the libraries.
Talk to the puritan descendants.
Make a really thorough investigation.
Your brother is a Professor of science.
I hardly think he'd be interested in witchcraft.
Then I go alone.
You don't think he'd object to that?
You leave Richard to me.
He's picking me up here for lunch.
Hello, Bill.
- Professor Barlow.
- Nan here?
She's in there with him.
I don't like her getting mixed up in this witchcraft business.
Why not?
It's only part of her history course.
- Professor Barlow?
- Yes?
Before you go in there, could I have a word with you?
- Yes, sure.
- Well, it's about Nan and me.
Oh.
If you're really serious about this,
I happen to know the town in New England.
It's the identical place where the events occurred that I mentioned today, Whitewood.
It's quite a small place.
It's a little bit off the beaten track.
- So maybe these directions will help you.
- Thank you.
I think you might very well find what you're looking for there.
I happen to know the woman who owns the inn at Whitewood.
Her name is Mrs Newless.
So you just tell her I sent you.
Raven's Inn, Whitewood.
What's Whitewood?
Now, Dick, don't be too upset, but I'm gonna change my plans for the vacation.
- Change of plans?
- Yes.
I'm going to a place called Whitewood for a week or so to do some research.
Oh, are you?
And what about cousin Sue?
She's expecting you for her birthday party on the 17th.
She'll never forgive you.
I can still easily make it by then.
This is important.
My term paper's got to be good.
It could mean a scholarship.
- I've made all the arrangements.
- Dick, you'll have a good time without me.
My mind's made up.
I'm going to Whitewood.
But surely any good encyclopaedia will give you all the nonsense you wanna know.
Witchcraft is not nonsense, Barlow.
I'm sorry, Driscoll.
Witchcraft, black magic, sorcery, to me it's nothing but fairy-tale mumbo-jumbo.
I'm a scientist, Driscoll.
I believe what I can see, what I can feel and touch.
"The basis of fairy tales is reality.
The basis of reality is fairy tales."
As a scientist, you should be familiar with that quotation.
I don't believe somebody in Chicago can die of a heart attack, because some woman in New Orleans sticks a pin in a wax doll!
Maybe you don't, but practitioners of voodoo claim otherwise.
- Dick, you're just being difficult.
- No.
When I look into a microscope, I see the bacteria, swimming, fighting, existing.
That's real! These witches, they were persecuted and burned in the 17th century.
Were real too, but they weren't witches.
They were pitiful human beings.
Victims of hysteria.
There are many eminent scholars who have documentary proof of the actual practice of witchcraft.
Yes, but how effective was this practice?
Did any of these eminent scholars ever meet a real practising witch?
Did you ever meet a witch, Driscoll?
Perhaps.
Oh, come on. You're a historian.
No witch ever survived a burning at the stake for all their pacts with the Devil.
In 1692 Elizabeth Selwyn went to the stake.
She was buried in a churchyard in New England.
- And yet three years later...
- Yes.
And yet three years later a new wave of blood sacrifices broke out in the village that condemned her.
The daughters of the elders who had condemned her were found murdered with every last drop of blood drained from their bodies, and afterwards people came forward to testify they had seen Elizabeth Selwyn.
Stop! This'd be more effective at midnight with howling winds and crashing thunder.
And even then it wouldn't frighten anyone.
Dick!
I'm sorry Professor Driscoll.
It's all right, Miss Barlow.
You won't be the first person to have scoffed at the subject.
Honey, when you get to, urn, where is it?
- Whitewood.
- Ah, yes, Whitewood.
Well, send me a picture postcard of the witch.
If possible, autographed.
Now, uh, let's have some lunch, eh?
I'm sorry, I have a date.
Nan, darling, I still don't see why you have to go up to this Whitewood place.
Huh? I thought we were gonna have some time together during this vacation.
You know I wanna be with you.
It's just this is important.
Look, what the heck can you find that hasn't been found before?
I don't know.
It's just that maybe, hidden in some attic or buried in some old antique shop, there's something that might give a new outlook on the subject.
Oh, what new outlook can there be?
You're a science student.
You know how important research is.
But this isn't about anything real.
This is just superstitious people burning silly old women.
But suppose the women weren't silly.
Suppose they really had a pact with the Devil.
A pact that could have supernatural power.
Oh, come on. What kind of power?
I don't know.
Oh, look, it's no use, Bill.
We've both tried our hardest to talk her out of going.
Do you think she will find anything worthwhile?
I think we have to respect her desire to find something new, even if we don't agree with the subject.
Agree with it?
I've never heard so much nonsense as that guy Driscoll talks in all my life.
Well, here I am, all packed.
Oh. I suppose nothing I can say will stop you from going, huh?
Yeah, well, I'll, uh,
I'll put this in the car.
I still hoped you'd change your mind, Nan.
Don't worry, darling. I'll be back as quick as I can, and I'll write.
Well, don't forget me altogether, huh?
I won't. Give Sue my love, and don't forget we have a date at our party.
Bye, darling.
Uh, excuse me.
Can you help me? I seem to be lost.
Sure, if I can.
- I'm looking for the Wamport Road.
- Wamport Road?
Hardly anyone uses that any more.
Well, my friend gave me the directions.
Uh, "take road 28A, turn onto the Wamport Road,
"bear left at the fork through to Whitewood."
- Whitewood?
- Am I that far away?
No, ma'am. Not far.
Not many God-fearing folks visit Whitewood nowadays. If I were you, I...
If, if you'll excuse me.
I'm in a hurry. Which way is it?
Well, follow this road about two miles, you come to a fork.
There'll be a sign: Wamport Road.
Turn left, keep straight, there'll be Whitewood.
Thank you very much.
Does that sign say "Wamport Road"?
Wamport Road? Yes.
Oh, good. I was afraid I missed it.
- Is it Whitewood you seek?
- Yes.
I, too. Uh, would I be imposing if...?
No, of course not. Get in.
Thank you.
You'd think the Highway Commission would do something about these roads.
Watch out. Here comes another bump.
What is your mission in Whitewood?
Mission? Well, I'm going there to do some research on witchcraft.
Professor Driscoll gave us very interesting lectures on the subject.
I'm going there to get some original source material.
- Do you know Whitewood?
- I've known it for many years.
- Do you go there often?
- Fairly often.
Oh, then you must know the Raven's Inn.
- I shall be resting there.
- Oh, so shall l.
Oh, my name's Nan Barlow.
My name's Jethrow Keane.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.
It's just like a picture out of a history book.
I feel as though I were in the 17th century.
Why hasn't Whitewood been written about?
It's off the beaten path.
Few tourists come here.
For Whitewood time stands still.
Look at that church.
Must have been beautiful.
What a shame they let it get so run down.
- Straight on?
- Yes, follow the road around.
Ah, there it is.
What a lovely old building.
17th century at least.
How picturesque can you get?
Right by the graveyard.
Yes. It has not been used for more than 200 years.
- Any witches buried there?
- There are, indeed.
All in a section of unconsecrated ground.
Spooky, isn't it?
Well, keep your fingers crossed for me, Mr Keane.
I hope Mrs Newless has that room.
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
Are you Mrs Newless?
- No.
- Oh, I'm Nan Barlow.
I was told I might find a room here.
I was recommended by a friend,
Professor Driscoll.
Perhaps you know him.
That will be all, Lottie.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
Unfortunately, Lottie cannot talk.
I've often told her not to answer the bell.
Poor thing.
Then you're Mrs Newless.
I am. May I help you?
Yes, I'd like to have a room here for two weeks.
The hotel is quite full.
Oh, the guests are never about at this time of day.
Well, I'm a student of Professor Drisc0ll's.
He told me if I mentioned his name,
I'd have no trouble.
Well, there is a room
I could let you have.
It's just off the lobby.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Mrs Newless, that plaque.
Is it true that Elizabeth Selwyn was really burnt here for being a witch?
She was.
And do you believe she was a witch?
Come along.
I'll show you to your room.
I hope you will be comfortable.
Yes, it is a nice room.
The previous occupants have always found it most agreeable.
Well, if there's anything you should need, just ring the bell for me at the desk.
Thank you.
Oh!
It's been so many months.
I have counted the days till this holiday.
So have the others.
It wasn't easy for some of my guests to get here.
Many had to travel vast distances.
I was lucky.
The last few miles were enchanting.
Miss Barlow is very good company.
You must be tired, Jethrow.
Your room is ready.
And the festivities?
I am prepared.
Oh, Mrs Newless.
I thought I'd have a short look around town.
I won't be gone long.
I think you'll find the church interesting.
Unfortunately, it no longer has a congregation.
He will be pleased.
I'm told this was once a house of worship.
It is still a house of worship.
I am the reverend of this church.
As long as the breath of life is within me, this house shall remain God's house.
Must have been a beautiful building.
For me, it is still beautiful.
I'm sorry. What a shame that people have let it fall into such a state.
Strangers rarely come to Whitewood.
Who are you?
I'm Nan Barlow.
I'm staying at the Raven's Inn.
Why have you come to Whitewood?
Well, because I'm interested in witchcraft.
Young woman, leave Whitewood.
Leave Whitewood tonight.
For 300 years the Devil has harboured over this city, made it his own.
The people in it are his.
Evil has triumphed over good here.
Look at my church.
I have no parish.
No one worships here.
His is the power.
- What power?
- Leave Whitewood.
Leave Whitewood tonight.
I beg of you!
- What power?
- Leave before it is too late!
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Please excuse the mess.
We haven't been open long.
- You have some very interesting things here.
- Yes, they belong to my grandmother.
When she died,
I came back to sort things out.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Then you don't live here?
No. My family have lived here for generations, but I've been back a few weeks.
- Would you like to have a look around?
- Thank you.
I didn't mean to frighten you when I came in.
It's just that all the people I've met here have acted like I'm a person from another world.
They don't see many strangers here.
And I had the most, well, unusual experience with the reverend.
He barred my way from the church.
And he talked to me about a curse.
And he warned me to leave Whitewood.
Can you explain that?
No, I can't.
Does he often act that way?
- He's my grandfather.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, it's all right.
It's happened before with strangers.
The lack of parishioners, the loss of his sight has made him bitter and suspicious.
I'm afraid what with him and the town,
I was very scared.
When I saw your lights
I made a dash for them.
I'm glad you did.
Do you have any books or pamphlets on witchcraft?
- You do, don't you? A friend of mine...
- We have a collection gathering dust.
But why on earth would you be interested in...?
- I'm sorry. It's none of my business.
- That's all right.
I'm studying it in college, and I've come here to write my term paper.
Just wait. I'll see what I can find.
That's Elizabeth Selwyn.
Burned as a witch, March 3rd, 1692.
Yes, I know.
I saw the plaque in the lobby of the hotel.
- You're staying at the Raven's Inn?
- Yes.
It was recommended to rne by a friend, Professor Driscoll.
- Alan Driscoll?
- Yes. Do you know him?
No, but my grandfather speaks of him.
His family come from here.
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- Here. I think this'll do for a start.
What a lovely locket. May I see it?
- I believe it's quite old.
- Oh, it is. You're very lucky.
I'm even more lucky to have found this.
"A Treatise on Devil Worship in New England".
This must be a very rare book.
I'm afraid I couldn't afford to buy it.
You can borrow it if you like.
Oh, could I? That would be wonderful.
I promise I'll bring it back in a few days.
- You're very welcome, Miss...?
- Barlow. Nan Barlow.
Nan Barlow.
- Thank you very much. Good night.
- Night.
Mrs Newless!
- Mrs Newless?
- Yes, Miss Barlow?
L- |- I've heard some strange noises in my room.
Oh, possibly the water in the pipes.
This is a very old inn.
No, it seemed to be coming from the cellar underneath.
I hardly think so, Miss Barlow.
The cellars do not extend beneath your room.
But then why is there a trap door in the floor?
The ground was filled in many years ago to strengthen the foundations.
- But I'm sure...
- If you insist, I will come and see.
I don't hear anything.
Well, just a few minutes ago...
- Never mind. I'm sorry.
- You're welcome.
But you can see, there is no ring in the trap door because there is no reason to lift it.
There is nothing underneath but earth.
Come in.
Oh, hello, Lottie. Come in.
Oh, I don't need any more towels.
I haven't used mine.
They're quite clean.
Lottie... I've told you before not to bother the guests.
Miss Barlow, I thought you might care to join the others.
I will as soon as I finish my notes.
I'll put some clothes on and join them.
"A Treatise on Devil Worship in New England".
Well, do you find this interesting?
Well, it's fascinating.
The things I've learnt.
I bet you don't know the half of it.
And you live right here on a spot where the witches were actually burnt.
Listen to this.
"On Candlemas Eve,
February 1st, in the year 1692,
"a coven of witches... " a coven, that's 13, some men, some women,
"whose power came from the Devil
"gathered beneath the Raven's Inn
"to perform a black mass in the honour of Lucifer.
"The witch, Elizabeth Selwyn, later to be burnt at the stake,
"marked a young girl for sacrifice
"by obtaining an object of value belonging to her, with which to call her.
"And leaving in its place a dead bird and a sprig of Woodbine.
"The witches sacrificed her on the altar,
"and drank her blood at the hour of 13."
What's the hour of 13?
Well, personally I have never heard a clock strike more than 12.
- Now, how about joining the dancing?
- In a little while, I promise.
Oh, by the way,
I seem to have misplaced my locket.
I remember having it in my room, and now it's disappeared.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll ask Lottie.
Well, I-I'm not saying it was stolen.
It's just I remember having it on the dresser, and now it's gone.
I would appreciate it.
Of course.
I'll look into it immediately.
Lottie, I have warned you too often about annoying our guests.
If you disobey me again,
I shall turn you out.
And if I turn you out, there will be no place for you anywhere.
You do understand, Lottie, don't you?
Ah, Miss Barlow.
I'm afraid Lottie is nowhere to be found.
I will enquire about your locket first thing in the morning.
Oh, thank you.
Where is everybody?
Most of the other guests have gone to the services.
Services? On the 1st of February?
Candlemas Eve.
The night when the witches mock the rituals of the church.
Are you all right, Miss Barlow?
Yes, quite, thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night, Miss Barlow.
Mrs Newless!
Mrs Newless! Mrs Newless!
Quiet.
No! No!
No! Let go of me!
Help! No!
Let me go! No!
No! Take your hand off me!
Let me go!
No! No! No!
Let go of me! No!
Six, seven...
No! No, Mrs Newless, no!
No! No! No!
I am Elizabeth Selwyn.
No! No!
- No!
- Let go of me! Let go!
# Happy birthday to you
# Happy birthday, dear Susie
# Happy birthday to you #
Mmm, yummy.
Delicious.
Dick, have you got any idea what's happened to Nan?
I'm sure she'll show up.
She's probably met a good-looking he-witch.
Bringing him, but his broomstick blew a gasket.
It's not like Nan to be late for anything.
Aren't you a bit worried about her?
She'll be here.
I'm sure she'll make it.
That's probably her now.
You answer the door. I'll put a record on for some dancing.
All right.
- Hi, Dick.
- Bill.
What's the matter?
Expecting somebody else?
Oh, yes, Nan.
Come in, come in.
Nan? Isn't she here yet?
We made a date to meet here before she left for Whitewood.
Well, she probably got held up.
Look, look, give me your coat.
Nan was never late for anything in her life.
Relax. Take it easy.
Enjoy the party. She'll be here.
Dick...
Dick, I haven't had a letter from Nan in over two weeks now.
She's probably been too busy working on her paper.
Oh, no. There's something wrong,
I know it.
- Will you do something for me?
- Mm-hm.
Ring up Whitewood, will ya?
Ask 'em, ask 'em if she's left.
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I am.
OK.
Hello. Long distance.
I'd like to speak with a Miss Nan Barlow at the Raven's Inn, Whitewood.
No, I don't have a phone number.
What, didn't she give you the phone number?
Why, no, but that's my sister.
They say there's no such place as the Raven's Inn.
But that's crazy.
She's staying there.
Give me the police.
She left in such a hurry, she must have forgotten to return it to you, Miss Russell.
She seemed such a nice girl, too.
Wouldn't have thought she was the sort who'd forget.
We cannot always judge by our first impressions, can we?
I'm not usually wrong about the people I lend my books to.
Well, perhaps you'll be more careful in future.
- Thank you for letting me have it.
- Remember me to your grandfather.
Lottie! Get out of the way, you clumsy creature.
- Can I help you?
- We're from the Sheriff's office.
We had a call this evening.
A missing person report for some college kid named Nan Barlow.
The party calling said her last known whereabouts was the Raven's Inn.
Nan Barlow. That's strange.
Yes, I met her.
When did you last see her?
About two weeks ago.
She came to my shop, and borrowed this book.
It's quite valuable, and not hearing from her,
I decided to come and get it.
Mrs Newless had it.
- May I?
- Yes.
"A Treatise on Devil Worship"?
I must put this in the report.
Peculiar things some of these college kids do nowadays.
Well, thanks for your help.
Come on, Charlie.
Hello?
Yeah.
It's the police.
Yeah.
OK, thanks.
Thank you.
Well?
The police sent a car out to the Raven's Inn.
Nan checked out two weeks ago.
- I don't get it.
- Well, neither do I.
Look, these are Nan's books and papers.
Go through them. See if you can find anything which might give us a lead.
I'm gonna pay a visit to a colleague of mine.
Oh, Lord of Light, accept this sacrifice.
- Why, Barlow.
- May I come in?
Well, yes, of course. Please do.
Can I take your coat?
I tried to phone you last night, but I guess you weren't in.
No... No, I wasn't.
Would you care to go in the study?
- Sit yourself down.
- Thanks.
You take a drink?
Brown soda.
- Ice?
- Please.
- Now what's on your mind?
- Well, Nan's missing.
And she has been since the day after she arrived at Whitewood.
Really? You quite sure?
It's what the police said.
- What are they doing about it?
- Carrying out a routine check.
I don't suppose they can much more until they've got something definite to go on.
I would have thought there was a great deal more.
What? As far as they're concerned, she disappeared two weeks ago, and no one in the village seems to know anything about it.
- What have you come to see me for?
- I thought you might have some ideas.
- Why did you send her to Whitewood?
- It was the best place for her research.
- You suggested she stay at the Raven's Inn.
- It's the only inn there is.
With an unlisted phone number.
The inn has its own clientele, it doesn't need to advertise.
- How do you know it so well?
- Because I was born in Whitewood.
I see. Then you'd have every reason to believe she'd be perfectly safe in going there.
I've no reason to suppose she wouldn't be.
Nan struck me as being perfectly capable of taking care of herself.
I grant you that, but why hasn't she come back, or let us know?
I can understand your anxiety, but I'm quite sure there's nothing for you to worry about.
She's probably got absorbed on the subject, and gone off someplace.
I wish that all my class had her application.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna find out where this application led her.
I'm going to retrace every step Nan took.
I'm either gonna find Nan, or know what happened to her!
- I can't stop you from going.
- No.
- You're not afraid?
- Afraid? Why?
If anything did happen to your sister, and somebody went to find out about it...
- The same thing might happen to them?
- Possible.
You seem to think something happened to my sister?
No. You are jumping to conclusions.
Really? I shall find her.
- Professor Driscoll?
- Yes.
I don't like to disturb you, but may I see you?
Of course. Please come in.
- Good luck in Whitewood.
- Thanks.
I'm sorry, but did you say he was going to Whitewood?
Yes, he is.
It's silly to be surprised, but I've just come from Whitewood.
Really? It's quite a coincidence.
My family happens to come from Whitewood. I was born there.
- Yes, I know.
- Please sit down.
Thank you.
- Care for a drink?
- No, thank you.
I think you know my grandfather, the Reverend Russell.
Russell? Oh, yes, of course I do.
How long have you been living in Whitewood?
Since my grandmother died a few weeks ago.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, now how can I help you?
I've come about a pupil of yours? Barlow.
- Nan Barlow?
- Yes.
She came to Whitewood two weeks ago.
I met her and liked her.
She told me that she was a student in one of your classes.
That you recommended that she stay at the Raven's Inn.
It's quite right, I did.
That's what I've come to see you about.
On the day after she arrived, she disappeared.
- Oh?
- Later the police came asking questions.
The family were worried.
I thought you might have their address.
Why do you want her family's address?
Because I have something of hers
I want to return.
Leave it with me, and I'll make sure they get it safely.
I don't want to trouble you.
If you just give me their address...
As you wish.
Her address is Dorchester Street.
225. She lives with her brother.
He's a colleague of mine.
You just met him.
He was leaving when you arrived.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a lot of work to do.
I'm rather a busy man at the moment.
- Thank you for your help.
- Not at all. I hope it achieves something.
- Remember me to your grandfather.
- Yes, of course. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Miss Russell.
Yeah, it's Nan's locket, all right.
As far as I know, it's unique.
I gave it to her.
Where did you get it?
The servant at the inn gave it to me.
It was strange.
I don't think she wanted Mrs Newless to know I had it.
- Mrs Newless?
- She runs the inn.
Oh. Why did you come here,
Miss... Miss Russell?
I found this.
It's Professor Drisc0ll's notepaper.
I found it in a book I lent your sister on her first evening in Whitewood.
When she didn't return it,
I went to the hotel.
- What was the book?
- An old book. A book about witchcraft.
Do you believe in it, Miss Russell?
I don't know. Sometimes I think
I almost live with it.
Live with it?
It's an obsession of my grandfather's.
Up till now I didn't take him seriously.
He's an old man.
But now I'm beginning to wonder if what he says isn't true.
What does he say?
That there's something evil about the village.
And on a certain night the inhabitants leave the streets, close their doors and stay behind them.
That on these nights the dead come to life.
Nights like Candlemas Eve?
What do you know about Candlemas Eve?
It's in one of Nan's books.
I don't believe it!
Things like this don't happen today.
In Whitewood I wonder.
I'm going to Whitewood tomorrow after classes. I can give you a lift.
Thank you, but I must get back.
I can't leave my grandfather alone.
He's blind.
May I come and see you when I arrive?
I'd... I'd like to have a talk with him.
Please do. It's the house next to the church. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- I'll see you to the door.
- Would you be going to Whitewood?
- Yes.
Would you take me along with you?
It's a dark night for walking.
You're the Reverend Russell's granddaughter, aren't you?
- Yes, how did you know?
- I know a great deal about Whitewood.
- Have you ever been there?
- Now and then.
- I've never seen you.
- To see me is a special privilege.
It's reserved for a chosen few.
What does that mean?
We'll soon be at Whitewood now.
This is as far as I go. You will...
She's pretty, too.
Yes, she is. Very pretty.
A living descendant of those who were cursed.
It somehow seems to make it better.
Another day.
And tomorrow...
The Witches' Sabbath.
Which way to Wamport Road?
Straight ahead. Fork in the road.
You see a sign, turn left.
- You heading for Whitewood?
- I am.
- Many people head this way?
- Not many.
Is this the only way in and out of the town?
In this direction, yep.
You wouldn't remember by any chance a pretty girl in a convertible about a month ago?
The Barlow girl. Read about her in the papers. Never seen her again.
- I told the police.
- Thanks.
Could you tell me the way to Whitewood, please?
Another one. Straight ahead.
Fork in the road. See a sign,
"Wamport Road", turn left as you ride in.
All right, thanks.
Let me warn you, young fellow.
They don't like strangers in Whitewood.
OK. Fine. Thanks very much.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
I'd like a room, please.
The inn is closing.
Well, I'll only be here a few days.
But the inn is closing.
- When?
- In two days.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to stay until then.
If you insist.
And could I... could I have the same room my, my sister had?
- It's still available, isn't it?
- Yes, it's available.
Mrs Newless, you told the police that my sister checked out.
You are mistaken, Mr Barlow.
I told them that on the morning of February 2nd,
I went to her room and found it empty.
Her bed not slept in.
Her luggage and car gone.
And her bill unpaid.
Well, you can put the charges on mine.
- When was the last time you saw her?
- On the evening of February 1st.
It was shortly before midnight.
She'd been in the lobby dancing with some of the guests.
She seemed to be enjoying herself.
Did any particular guest pay special attention to her?
Not that I noticed.
Your sister kept very much to herself.
You know why she came to Whitewood?
It is not my habit to enquire into people's private business.
Would the fact that she was investigating witchcraft antagonised anyone in the village.
Hardly. There have been other students here, you know.
Besides, your sister was a very agreeable and likeable young woman.
Well, have you any idea where she might have gone?
- None.
- Thank you.
Now, may I see the room?
As you wish. It is this way.
If you should need anything, and I am not at the desk, you have only to ring the bell.
Thank you.
- Hello.
- I'm so glad you've come.
I saw your car outside the Raven's Inn earlier.
I wondered what had happened to you.
I've been talking with Mrs Newless, and then I took a walk around the village.
Find out anything?
Everyone here seems to be afraid of something.
Then you don't think it's just my imagination?
I don't know. Who's to say where imagination ends and truth begins?
It's nothing tangible. It's...
Just the way they look at you.
I felt it too.
May I see the... the book that Nan borrowed?
Yes, I put a marker between the pages where she must have stopped reading.
Sit down, and I'll tell my grandfather you're here.
Thank you.
I warned you, Lottie.
Grandfather, this is Mr Barlow.
How do you do, sir?
God be with you.
Shall we sit where we'll be more comfortable?
Here's your chair, Grandfather.
You must be tired.
I am. Really tired.
I have little strength left these days for the fight.
Won't you sit down?
I'll make some coffee.
Fight against what, Mr Russell?
Against the evil that besets this village.
The people are creatures of the Devil.
They know no other God.
You mean they worship Satan here? Today?
Satanism was never stronger than at the present time.
For 200 years the people of Whitewood have carried out rituals that mock the Church's teaching.
I find it very hard to believe, sir.
Do not doubt, my son.
It is real enough.
For years I struggled against the witches.
Their master took away my sight.
It seems incredible.
I have tried to convince others.
They too found it unbelievable.
But I know these people have a pact with the Devil.
To worship him and do his works.
In return he gives them eternal life.
- Eternal life?
- Aye.
And to seal this bargain they must sacrifice a young girl on two nights of the year.
When are these nights, sir?
Candlemas Eve and the Witches' Sabbath.
Candlemas Eve.
That's, that's February the 1st.
- And when is the Witches' Sabbath?
- Tonight.
Now you know why I came to see you.
I had no idea it was so late.
May I... may I have a rain check on the coffee?
I'd like to have a few words with Mrs Newless again.
- Of course.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
- I'll see you to the door.
God be with us.
Miss Russell, do you think that Nan's disappearance is connected in some way with these... witches' ceremonies?
Yes.
Well, I'd... I'd like to come back later, if I may.
- Please do. And my name is Pat.
- And mine's Richard.
I think I feel better now you're here.
Well, I'm... I'm gonna stay until I find out what's happened to Nan.
Take care.
Now drink your coffee before it gets cold.
You must not see that young man again tonight.
- Why not?
- The Devil comes in many disguises.
I'll get you a spoon.
Grandfather, there's a bird in the drawer.
It's got an arrow through it.
Go and look on the front door.
- It's a sprig of Woodbine.
- Shut the door! Shut the door quickly!
- Grandfather, what does it mean?
- Now, listen, my darling.
This is their sign. The witches' sign.
- What can we do?
- We must leave here.
Leave here immediately.
I'll start the car.
Somethings wrong.
They've wrecked the car.
Barlow! Phone Barlow!
Hello? Hello?
Hello. I want the Raven's Inn.
Yes? Mrs Newless.
Mr Barlow?
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Hello?
Dick, I'm in terrible danger.
We've got to leave Whitewood at once.
Danger? But from what?
'We've got to leave...'
- Pat? Patricia!
- 'Please help me!'
Pat!
Patricia! Pat!
Pat!
Patricia!
Mr Russell, are you there?
Mr Russell.
What's happened, Mr Russell?
The witches...
The witches... have Patricia.
Destroy them.
- Mr Russell, how?
- The shadow of the cross.
Use the cross.
I adjure thee, O creatures of salt by the living God.
Mr Russell.
Maitland! Maitland, what, what's happened?
Pat! Patricia!
Hello? Hello, operator?
Damn!
Pat!
We've been waiting for you.
Dick, these are the dead who killed Nan!
Barlow!
Please help me!
Come on, Pat! Hurry up!
Quick! This way!
Dick!
Dick!
No!
- Pat!
- Dick!
Maitland! Get to a cross! A cross!
A shadow of a cross!
Dick! Dick, he's moving!
Lift the cross!
Quick!
O creatures of salt,
I adjure thee by the living God.
Back from the cross!
Come nearer, Bill.
- Get the shadow over them!
- It comes nearer.
We dare not fail.
We must finish the sacrifice.
- Dick!
- Pat!
Wait. Wait for the hour of 13.
Pat, are you all right?
I think so.
Bill!
I have a score to settle with Mrs Newless.
You stay here.

My name is Aki Shima.
I was never very popular as a fashion model.
But I was very moved by the artistic sense of the photographer,
Mr. Yamana.
And quite willing to let him take such pictures of me.
The exhibition created quite a sensation.
I went to the gallery one morning for an early meeting.
To discuss our next project.
At such an early hour, there was only one visitor.
He didn't take any notice of the photographs.
He was crouched at the foot of the featured statue.
It was a nude study of me.
It was sculpted by one of
Mr. Yamana's friends.
His whole demeanor was very strange.
What happened next was unexpected.
It felt as if the statue and my body were somehow one.
I felt his hands as he pawed the statue.
It felt as if he was running them over my body.
It sent shivers down my back.
I ran out of the gallery.
Several days later
I worked for Yamana again.
I woke up at 4 in the morning and drove down to the studio.
Yamana was very demanding, working for him was hard.
I was exhausted, but I still had to drive back to my apartment in Tokyo.
Once home, I called a local masseur to relieve my fatigue.
It's open.
Come in.
I'm from Sakura Massage.
They've never sent you before.
That's correct.
Your normal masseur is otherwise occupied.
They sent me instead.
Do you mind?
I guess not.
I only moved here three days ago.
I beg your pardon.
Hurry up and start.
If you don't mind.
Give it some muscle.
I like it hard.
If it doesn't hurt, it doesn't satisfy me.
Like this?
Harder than that.
Your body is quite stiff.
Massage is good for younger women, too.
It stimulates the circulation so you look better.
More so for someone in your line of work.
How do you know what I do?
You're Aki Shima.
Famous for those sensational photos.
And very famous among we masseurs.
Sometimes I really appreciate my work.
I get to talk to famous people like you.
And besides,
I get to touch you.
I'm not famous.
You're very beautiful.
Flattery.
I am not that pretty.
To the blind, faces don't really matter.
It's your body and the silkiness of your skin.
You really are exceptional.
Stop that!
What the hell?
I'm very sorry.
The blind have eyes in our fingertips.
I know your body better than someone with eyes.
From top to bottom.
The feel of the blind man's fingers on me, was exactly like the man stroking the statue.
Could it be him?
Perhaps cold clay wasn't enough.
The thought of that made me angry.
I said no!
Don't you get it?
I'm sorry.
That's enough.
Leave now.
But I've just started.
Forget it.
I'm very tired, I'm not feeling well.
I'll pay you anyway.
700 yen, isn't it?
What are you doing?
It was you!
I knew it.
- Well done.
- My coat.
So, you're finally awake.
You?
Where are you?
Where?
I'm here.
Where am I?
What is this place?
This is my studio.
Your studio?
Just like a warehouse from outside.
What are you?
I'm an amateur sculptor.
A sculptor?
I'm blind.
From birth, damaged optic nerves.
I'm totally blind.
Being blind is miserable.
From listening to people and
Braille books,
I can picture much of the world's beauty.
The sunlight, the color of clouds, splendid scenery and the beauty of works of art.
Plays, movies, even TV.
But I cannot see a thing.
I hate my parents for this.
But that doesn't achieve a single thing.
All that is left for the blind is sound, smell, taste and our sense of touch.
Sounds are like wind, no satisfaction.
Smells are useless.
Our noses aren't sensitive like dogs.
Food merely fills our bellies.
But what I have discovered is that touch is the only way to amuse us.
Our one tactile satisfaction.
Touch, the only sense worth anything to me.
I've touched everything I could.
I liked the feeling of touching animals best.
They're so warm and soft.
I've had dogs and cats to stroke.
I went to a farm to play with sheep and horses.
But no animal can compare with human flesh.
Especially the feel of women's bodies.
After finishing school,
I took a course in massage.
Every night I went to inns, hotels and apartments to work.
But not for the money.
I wanted to feel the women's skin.
Like faces, every skin is different.
Each with its own shape and feel.
So many women,
I became totally fixated.
Around then, I sold some land
I'd inherited from my father.
I made a fortune out of it.
But a blind man like me could find no use for money.
So I bought this warehouse and took up sculpture.
Recalling all of the women,
I reproduced their body parts from memory.
Now I can caress them at any time.
It took six years to build the studio.
I spent most of my inheritance.
When finally completed,
I was so happy.
Now I spend most of my time here.
Days and nights here in the darkness.
Amusing myself by caressing their bodies at will.
Be careful.
I'll put the lights on.
This is my studio.
What do you think?
You're insane.
But I soon got bored with it.
Real bodies are not like this.
The soft bodies of beautiful women with luscious skin.
When I finally realized that's what I needed,
I heard schoolboys talking about you.
What did they say?
They were discussing your photos and statue.
I went to the exhibition and ran my hands over the sculpture.
I registered at your massage agency and finally got to fondle you.
Those boys were right.
Your body is the finest
I've ever known.
Your shape, skin texture are exactly what I want.
Stay away!
Don't worry.
I'd never hurt you.
What are you planning?
Stay for a while and be a model for my sculpture.
So you kidnapped me?
I had no choice.
You would never have agreed.
Will you be my model?
No!
Not a chance in hell.
I'll pay very generously.
I don't want money.
If you do,
I'll create a work of art.
There are many kinds of art in our world.
Art for amusing the eye, the ear and the mind.
Why can't touching be an art form?
That's not my problem.
Every day we use touch.
We touch bowls, vases, desks and chairs.
Clothes and furs, too.
Art is more than color and shape, what about touch?
What about it?
I want to pioneer the art of touching.
Where only the blind can appreciate it.
A new art form, by and for the blind.
That is my life's mission.
I beg you, please be my model.
No way!
Go on, beat me, kick me.
I'll be your slave.
You can do anything to me.
Just let me touch you.
Help me create a totally new genre of art.
You're wasting your time.
Why, you ask?
You stripped naked for that photographer!
So why not for me?
That's obvious.
Mr. Yamana is a great artist.
He depicted me as the
New Woman of our Age.
That's why I posed for him.
But I also create art.
That's crap and you're crazy.
You just want to feel me up.
- Why say that?
- No, I said.
In that case...
...but I won't give up.
I'll wait no matter how long it takes.
I won't let you go until you agree.
You'll lock me up here?
Go ahead. The police will find me all the sooner.
No, they won't.
Why not?
I used a false identity when
I registered as a masseur.
Nobody saw us bringing you here.
And besides, we changed taxis many times.
We walked the last few blocks.
Even a massive search wouldn't find you.
You're insane!
You can't open it.
It's locked.
Help!
Somebody help me.
No use.
They're double doors of sheet iron.
It's useless to even try.
I can follow your scent, the sound of your breath.
I'll soon find you.
If you keep this up, you'll collapse from exhaustion.
Looks like I've got you.
Stop it right now, or you'll regret it.
You've got goose bumps.
Why are you so scared?
Let me go!
It's inevitable.
You give me no choice.
Enjoy your breakfast?
She didn't touch a single thing.
If you don't eat, you'll get sick.
I want to talk.
Come sit here.
Talk about what?
I sat up all night thinking about my position.
If you continue to lock me up here,
I won't be able to eat or sleep.
I'll go insane and I'll die.
So?
I'll do as you say,
I'll be your model.
Are you sure?
But once it's finished, you'll let me go, right?
Naturally.
After thinking about it
I realized that the art of touching is really quite an interesting concept.
A bold experiment.
It didn't take long to change your mind.
I was so scared
I could hardly think.
In these circumstances,
I think anybody would.
But once I calmed down,
I suddenly realized you're not insane at all.
You're a pioneer artist in a brand new genre.
You really think so?
The energy and passion you've shown in building this studio, proves you're truly unique.
I want to work with you to pioneer the art of touching.
I'm so pleased you finally understand, thank you.
Let's start right away.
I want your best work.
Excellent.
You're one in a million.
I searched long and hard for a body such as yours.
I love this body.
Can I take a break?
We've barely started.
But I don't feel well.
What's wrong?
My stomach really hurts.
Where?
Where does it hurt?
You won't call a doctor, will you?
No, of course not.
I caught a chill,
I'll just have to bear it.
Shall I turn up the heat for you?
Do you have any painkillers?
Aspirin, anything.
I'll go and look.
If not, can you buy me some?
I want to get well and get back to modeling.
I understand.
Where are you going?
Let go of me!
Michio, she's trying to escape.
Was she really trying to escape, Mother?
If I'd been any later, she'd be long gone.
Is that right?
So you lied to me with your fancy stories.
Let me go, please let me go!
You won't leave until Michio finishes his work.
No!
I'll go crazy!
Let me out!
Let me go!
Shut up, will you.
I'll keep watch over her.
You concentrate on your art, it's your only pleasure in life.
Thank you. I couldn't do anything without you, Mother.
Don't be silly. You know
I'd do anything for you.
I'm your mother, of course I will.
Now get back to work.
How long will it take you to finish it?
This will be the pinnacle of my art, so I can't really say.
If that's the case, maybe we should try to be friends.
If not, this oppressive atmosphere will drive me crazy.
It's your fault, you tried to trick me.
I'm very hungry.
Mother will bring lunch.
Will you eat here with me?
Dine together?
I don't have much appetite on my own.
I'll get thin, my skin will suffer.
I'll be a poor model.
That won't do.
That's why I want us to dine happily together.
Or do you prefer eating with Mommy?
What mischief are you planning now?
Do you love your mother?
Of course I do.
She raised a blind boy all by herself.
She taught me to read and write, to live as a human being.
I love her more than anything.
Was it always just you two?
Where's your father?
He died soon after I was born.
Any friends, lovers?
Not one.
So you've never had a woman?
You poor thing.
That's why you built this studio.
You prefer cold clay to a living, breathing woman.
Mother is the only woman
I know.
Now I know why you make such gigantic figures.
They're from a baby's perspective.
You love to nestle in their arms like a baby.
I wonder.
But a real woman is much different.
If you had a lover, you'd know.
It's much more fun.
Is that right?
Well, what about meals?
Will you eat with me or with Mommy?
With you.
I'm thrilled.
I'd like a drink, too.
Alcohol?
You like a drink, don't you?
It gives you an appetite.
No.
I've never tried alcohol.
You've never had a single drink?
You poor thing.
It's sublimely delicious.
Is that right?
I like wine.
Go buy some.
Another trick?
Get me drunk and run away?
You're so suspicious.
Your mother wouldn't let me past.
I've given up trying to escape.
Is that true?
Will she get angry if you dine with me?
No, not at all.
She'll do anything I ask her to.
I wonder.
I'll go get dinner and a drink.
That was an excellent meal.
I ate every scrap.
This wine is wonderful.
Is my face flushed?
It's a lovely glow.
Other than my mother, you're the first person
I've dined with.
Was it fun?
Shall we continue doing it?
- Still angry?
- No.
Shall we get back to work?
I'll put these away first.
Leave them.
Your mother will do it anyway.
Carry me up there.
You've finished the arms and legs, what's next?
Your breasts.
Really?
Go ahead, touch them.
Your fingers are very delicate but ever so masculine.
It feels wonderful.
So why did you object?
At first I didn't like the idea.
But I've gradually grown to love you.
I didn't realize just how kind you are.
I can hardly believe it.
There's not another man who worships my body like you.
What about that photographer?
No, that's different.
I'm just another model to him.
But I'm your one and only.
We women are conceited, we need to dominate.
I'm very, very lucky.
I really love you.
Another trick!
You liar!
You don't believe me?
Here's the evidence.
You still doubt me?
I'll keep going until you change your mind.
No, no, I believe you.
I really do.
I always thought being blind would repel most women.
Do you love me?
Of course I do.
Was that your first ever kiss?
Did you enjoy it?
Tongues are so sensitive.
Far more so than fingers.
So warm, soft and sweet.
This time you try it.
Michio!
What is it, Mother?
Stop playing and get back to work.
Your mother seems angry.
I wonder why.
She's shocked.
It's her first time to see me in a woman's arms.
There's so much I can teach you.
Things only a lover knows and a mother cannot do.
It's almost dawn.
You need your sleep.
Don't overtax yourself.
I want to keep going.
Be happy for me, she's helping me make a unique work of art.
Isn't that wonderful?
And she loves me.
She actually loves me.
I doubt it.
It sounds unlikely, but it's the honest truth.
You idiot.
Can't you see she's fooling you?
When you let down your guard, she'll escape.
I really have fallen in love with him.
I could stay here forever.
Don't be ridiculous.
No gaudy young thing like you would fall for Michio.
What's that supposed to mean?
Am I so repellent?
I know very well what she's up to.
She's making a fool of a blind country bumpkin.
Is that right?
I get it now.
Your mother's jealous.
She's bad mouthing me for stealing her precious son.
Jealous?
Mother's jealous?
Yes. You're more than a son to her, you know.
She's substituted you for her husband or a lover.
So she sees me as her rival.
Shut up!
I can understand it, but it disgusts me.
Especially at her age.
Is she right, Mother?
I won't stand by and watch her make a total fool out of you!
Mother, I'm an adult,
I want you to stop being jealous.
I'm free to fall in love.
Is that right?
Then do as you please.
You're free to go.
What's that?
Get dressed and get out of here.
I can leave?
Yes, now go.
If you go to the police,
I'll get back at you.
If it takes all my life,
I swear.
I understand.
There's money in your bag, go and hail a taxi.
Hurry up.
Mother?
Where are you going?
It's snowing, we're freezing.
I'm just going to get some coal, out of my way.
Why not go alone?
Why do you have to take her with you?
Alright,
I'll tell you everything.
I'm getting rid of her.
But why?
The sculpture isn't finished yet.
You can get another girl.
I'll help you find one.
Don't you understand?
It has to be her.
Not at all.
Her type are a dime a dozen.
She's unique.
I'll never find another like her.
Michio, please.
Forget all about her.
Never!
What are you doing?
Michio, listen to me.
I've done everything you've ever asked for.
I helped you buy and then build the studio.
Just once, do this one thing for me.
Please, get rid of her for me.
No, never!
Mother.
How dare you do this to me?
Have you forgotten how I sacrificed everything to raise you?
It wasn't easy to raise a blind child.
And who was it who gave birth to a blind child? You!
Don't you ever forget, Michio,
I did my utmost to raise you properly.
She's exactly the opposite.
She loves herself, she has no feelings for you.
If you don't get rid of her now, you'll suffer for it.
She's not like that.
She's sweet and kind.
You have no idea about the outside world.
You know nothing about women.
A slut like her is nothing but trouble.
A slut, am I?
That's what we call women who bare their bodies for money.
You call it "art," but it's greed and grasping for fame.
I'm not like that.
I'm a virgin,
I've lead a good, honest life.
That's a joke!
How did you fool Michio?
Go on, tell me.
What kind of mother humiliates her son's lover?
I know what you're trying to do.
You want your little boy to stay forever.
You want to sleep with him.
What did you say?
I feel sorry for Michio.
With a mother like you, he can never find love.
Always alone,
Mommy's little plaything.
Shut up!
Is that what you want?
To never experience physical love?
Always a little boy, never a real man?
I love you.
I want to be with you.
Is she more important to you than me?
How could you...
I want to save you from her.
I'll even marry you.
On the condition that you cut all ties to her.
Any real mother would be pleased to raise her son and send him into the world.
You bitch!
Mother!
What are you doing?
Please stop it!
Please Mother, stop it.
That's enough.
Help me!
I'll kill you, you evil, conniving bitch!
I can't breathe!
Help me!
Please help me.
Mother, stop it at once!
I can't breathe...
Let her go!
She's killing me.
Mother, will you stop it!
Are you alright?
Are you hurt?
Just a little shaken.
Your mother.
Something's wrong...
What's that?
She's dead.
Dead?
Mother, this can't be!
Oh, no!
She hit her head on the pillar.
It was a freak accident.
Mother, no...
What have I done to you?
You loved me so much...
You took care of me...
How could I go and kill you?
Mother, please forgive me.
It was my fault.
I was so stupid.
Please forgive me.
You will stay, won't you?
You run away?
Let me go, please!
She was right.
You lied about loving me.
Let me go!
I'm sick of this.
You deliberately provoked my mother.
Didn't you?
All you want is to escape.
Of course I do.
How can I possibly stay here?
You're evil.
You'd deceive a blind man.
It was you who killed my mother!
It's no use fighting back.
You're coming with me.
Kill me!
Get it over with!
I'd rather be dead than suffer like this.
You won't get away now.
I've got you.
In place of Mother, you'll be here till you die!
You said I was a "Mommy's boy," didn't you?
You said my work is a poor substitute for a real woman.
Right!
I'll prove to you I'm a man.
I'll take your virginity!
You beast!
You animal!
Yes, the beast who killed his mother.
I can do anything now.
You're all mine,
I'll have you.
You'll be my lover.
I'd rather be dead!
No you won't, you'll make a man of me.
I'll show you love.
Then you'll know.
Several days passed.
We buried his mother under the dirt floor of the old warehouse.
In the studio, with total disregard for day or night, he made love to me repeatedly.
By the time he finished the sculpture,
I had developed a slight affection for him.
Do you still want to leave here?
Leave me and go back to your world?
Not now.
It's strange, but I seem to have forgotten that world.
Have you given up because you can't escape?
No.
I don't hate you any more.
Why is that?
Making love with you has been wonderful.
You're very strong, yet so gentle.
You've shown me the true beauty of a woman.
Sculptures are inanimate.
They can never match the feel of a woman.
You are far superior.
At the same time as I was falling in love,
I, too, began to go blind.
Darling.
I've started to go blind.
Here, in constant darkness, only feeling and caressing your body, my eyes have atrophied, and I've started to go blind.
So, you're blind like me now.
Is it a demerit?
Are you sad?
Quite the opposite.
People pity the blind, what a big mistake.
I pity those who have sight.
They can never know the tactile ecstasy of our caresses.
You finally understand.
I do.
My sense of touch is so acute.
So sweet, so deep, yet so certain.
Shape, form and color can't even approach our tactile level of artistic expression.
So I'm not crazy, am I?
You're not insane, you're awesome.
Your sense of touch is almost not human.
I envy you.
Some day you'll reach the same level as me.
How I wish that day would hurry.
The sensation at the tip of my fingers, has become so acute
I can almost "taste."
As sensitive as insect feelers and animal whiskers.
Like the lower orders of life, without eyes, only able to feel.
Like an amoeba, or jellyfish, at the dawn of life.
The same sensations as the most primeval creature.
As if going back to the womb of human creation, so dark, so sweet and so pervadingly familiar.
When I look with my eyes, you're a different man to the one I feel.
Different?
How?
You look normal.
But to the touch, you're divine.
These small depressions, the large curves and projections.
As I caress your body,
I perceive constant variations.
Like the flow of a musical masterpiece.
Delicious fun.
Is that right?
Again, days flew by.
We both explored the innermost secrets of our bodies.
The most subtle and shaded nuance of each other's flesh.
But in our tactile world of touch and feeling, we discovered unwritten, unrelenting, natural laws.
So much pleasure only spurred an ever increasing demand for more sensation.
Seeking greater satisfaction.
An unquenchable desire for ever more pleasure.
More! Deeper!
Harder!
Like this?
Not enough.
Bite me, bite me hard!
Like this?
Even harder.
Make me bleed.
More?
Harder, harder!
Feels so good!
It's my turn.
You bite me.
That was the beginning.
We began to take our pleasure through biting, clawing, and beating our bodies in a rage of sensation.
The pain-pleasure from nails, teeth and fists gradually declined in intensity.
We began using various devices to stimulate each other.
Whip me!
The more I suffered, the more I craved.
What is it within, that brings forth such ecstasy?
Does it mean that I was born with masochistic tendencies?
Had I arrived at the point where natural law and the sensations of pleasure collide?
We couldn't stop ourselves.
We escalated from innocuous devices of pleasure until we turned to knives to extract our ecstasy.
You really want me to cut you?
Go ahead, do it.
Where?
Anywhere.
Wherever you want.
Here?
Cut me, cut me.
Hurry.
Does it hurt?
It's agony.
But an exquisite pain.
Hurt me more.
Cover me with scars.
How's that?
More, more.
I don't care if I die.
Give it everything.
You want me to cut you up?
You like that pain?
Cut deeper!
Cut deep into me and twist the knife.
Are you alright?
This is so good.
More.
Drink more of my blood.
Now it's your turn.
That's when we began the inhuman rite of drinking each others'blood.
The ecstasy of it marked our descent into a nonhuman abyss.
But constant bliss, such as we felt, was never destined to last for long.
The stench of his mother's dead body began to fill the studio.
Our bodies cut and scarred, as if from battle, the loss of blood and constant pain began to sap our vitality.
We won't last much longer, will we?
No, I can barely muster the strength to stand.
All we have left is to wait for death to claim us.
Do you regret it now?
Why should I?
I've feasted on a bliss that most people never even know exists.
I'm ready to die at any time.
I've got a good idea.
What is it?
If we're to die anyway, make it an ecstatic death for me.
Bring me to tears of joy.
But how?
Cut my arms off.
My legs, too.
Cut this body of mine into pieces.
What for?
I'm sure that it will be agony, but also the ultimate ecstasy.
As I reach that climax, make it my moment of death.
You prefer that to a slow, lingering death?
Yes, of course.
I beg you.
I understand.
I'll die along with you.
To have my arms and legs cut from my body.
What a fitting punishment for our descent into a world where touch was bliss.
I gave myself a death sentence.
Alright,
I'll start to cut.
Good.
Are you happy?
Now the other one.
Don't stop now.
My legs. Hurry.
The world of touch...
The world of insects...
The lower orders such as the jellyfish...
Those who venture to the edge of such worlds, can expect only a dark, dank death to envelope them.
The End
BLACK SABBATH
"Freely adapted from stories... by Chekhov, Tolstoy, and Maupassant"
Come closer, please.
I have something to tell you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am Boris Karloff.
Allow me to introduce... three brief tales of terror and the supernatural.
I hope you didn't come to the movies alone.
As you will realize by watching this film... specters and vampires... are everywhere.
There might be one sitting next to you.
Yes, they go to the movies, too,
I assure you.
Vampires look perfectly normal, which, in fact, they are.
Except... they have a strange habit of drinking blood.
Especially the blood of those they love.
But here I am chattering on and wasting time.
So let's get on with our first tale.
THE TELEPHONE
Hello. Hello?
Hello. Hello?
Hello.
You're so beautiful:
Too beautiful, Rosy:
Who is this?
You'll know right before you die:
I can see your heavenly body:
Your silky arms: : : your perfect legs:
No, don't cover them up:
A body like yours can drive a man to madness:
And I will kill you:
Who is this?
Who are you?
Hello.
Why did you put your robe on?
You should have stayed as you were.
I like you better with nothing on:
That's how I want to find you:
I'll get in, even if you lock the door:
Who are you?
- What do you want from me?
- I told you:
I want to kill you:
I want revenge:
You did well to turn on all the lights:
I want to see you die:
Do you understand, Rosy?
I know you're listening:
I saw you, you know?
You hid your money and jewels:
How stupid:
You haven't changed:
You don't get it, do you?
I'm not interested in money...
I want you!
I want your splendid body:
And I'll have you: I will!
Not to caress you, but to wring your neck:
To choke you until you suffocate:
And I'll do it, Rosy:
You'll see!
Who is this?
Who are you? Answer me!
I beg of you. I can't take it anymore.
Why do you hate me?
What have I done to you?
Don't drive me mad like this.
Answer me, please!
"Frank Rainer Has Escaped..."
You're beginning to understand, huh, Rosy?
Tell me the truth:
You weren't expecting it, were you?
But I escaped just to come and find you:
And finally I'm close to you:
Very close, Rosy:
And you can't do anything about it:
Calling the police is useless:
Because I'm closer than the police:
Don't you forget it: much closer:
Frank, listen.
Listen to me, Frank!
- Hello.
- Mary, it's Rosy:
Hi, honey!
I really didn't expect your call.
You said you didn't want to see or speak to me anymore.
Please, now's not the time.
- Frank has escaped.
- Yes, I read about it.
So why are you telling me?
Now you two will get back together.
Mary, cut it out. I'm scared.
He wants revenge, I'm sure of it.
Come over right away, please!
You want me to come to you?
Did I hear correctly?
Yes, yes. I beg you.
As fast as you can.
He wants to kill me.
All right, honey.
I don't bear grudges.
Give me five minutes.
Thank you. Hurry.
Why did you go and call your friend Mary?
Are you hoping she can help you?
Did you think I wouldn't hear?
You spoke in a whisper, but it's no use:
Because I'm close, I told you:
Very close:
Call whoever you want, Rosy:
It's all of no use.
Even if you had an army around you.
By dawn, you will be dead.
Do you hear me, Rosy?
By dawn... you will be dead!
Rosy, it's me. Let me in.
- Hi. In trouble?
- How did you get in?
The door was open.
Look at all this light.
What, are you the mistress of the guy who reads the meter?
Sorry.
I was forgetting that you have a fine palate.
It must be the CEO of the company.
I see you haven't changed anything here.
Everything's just as it was when we were friends... and I came over all the time.
Just like old times.
Come on, honey.
Tell Mary everything.
Please, I'm not in the mood for humor.
Believe me.
All right, Rosy.
As you wish. No jokes.
He's been calling me since I got home.
He's been saying terrible things, with a cold, threatening voice.
He knows everything I do, sees my every move.
The first time he called,
I was in my bathrobe... and he knew it.
Then I put my house robe on... and he knew that too.
He even knew right away that I had called you.
It's as if he were in the room... spying on me, ready to kill me.
Don't be silly.
He's guessing.
He's going on a hunch.
I thought so too... but how did he know
I called you?
He called me right after that.
He always knew about us.
But what he doesn't know... is that you swore never to see me again.
He told me I'll die before dawn.
He's an exploiter, not a killer.
Trust me, he was just trying to frighten you.
Mary, I'm the one who turned him in... and he knows it.
I'm scared.
Come, come.
I'm here now.
Tomorrow we'll go to the police together.
He can call all he wants now.
Come on, give me a nightgown.
In the meantime,
I'll make you some tea.
What are you doing with that knife?
You never know.
- Still afraid?
- No, I'm better now.
Come on, then. Go to bed.
What's that?
Poison.
Compliments of Frank.
It's a tranquilizer, silly.
It will do you good.
Can't you see how shaken up you are?
"Dear Rosy, I'm sorry
I frightened you so: : : but it was the only way for me to get you to reconsider: : : your decision that caused me such pain:
Reading about Frank's escape gave me the idea:
The voice you heard: : : was mine:
Don't hate me for it:
Was seeing me again really so bad?"
Damn you!
Always where you shouldn't be.
THE WURDULAK
Who gave you that dagger?
Is this how you welcome strangers in this house?
With a gun?
- Who are you?
- I am Count Vladimir d'Urfé.
I wasn't planning on stopping here.
I was headed for Gersy.
Forgive me, sir... but this knife belongs to my father.
Take it.
Where did you find it?
Come and see.
He was on the horse.
He's gone.
I ran my sword through his heart.
Now he can't hurt anyone anymore.
If you killed him, may God bless you.
Is it Alibeq?
He was the only one in the area... who dressed like this.
- Haven't you heard of Alibeq?
- No.
A Turkish criminal, sir.
A horrible man.
He killed many people around here.
You saw me, I ran through his heart.
You should have done it.
I should have done it?
Why on earth?
They say he was a wurdulak:
When he found him, this was in his back.
We lived in fear.
No one was safe... and the number of victims grew day by day.
Any other scourge would have been easier to bear.
When Alibeq killed our foreman... my father decided it was time to hunt down that cursed Turk... and stop him once and for all.
My brother and I wanted to go with him... but he wouldn't let us.
My father and master will not be contradicted.
Thank you.
- What's your name?
- Sdenka.
A strange but beautiful name.
I've never heard it before.
Well, the Turk you were so afraid of is dead.
I drink to the health of whoever killed him.
Yes, Alibeq is dead.
Now the only one we have to fear is our father.
I don't understand.
You should be happy.
The nightmare is over, but you're still afraid!
If our father does not return within two hours... you must be on your way, for your own good.
To stay here, even for one night... could prove fatal, believe me.
Why did you not heed my brother's advice?
I could say that I'm too tired to continue my journey... or that the conversation piqued my curiosity.
But that wouldn't be the truth.
You're the reason I stayed.
You're very kind, sir... but if my father should return after midnight... there is little you could do for me... and you yourself would be in danger.
You must leave.
Calm yourself, Sdenka. I'm sure there's no cause for such alarm.
I'm sure your father isn't a monster.
Don't make jokes about this!
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- I know. You don't understand.
Tell me what this is all about.
Please. I may be able to help you.
Trust me, Sdenka.
Before my father left, he said...
"I'll be back within five days.
But if I should come back after five days have passed... do not let me in... but drive a dagger through my heart... because it will mean I too have become a wurdulak."
Your brother used this word too, but I don't know what it means.
If you had been born in these parts... you would be afraid even to say the word.
I'll tell you what it means.
The wurdulak are bloodthirsty corpses.
They yearn for the blood of those they loved most when they were alive.
Sdenka, you can't really believe that old legend.
You say that, but the legend is true.
The more they've loved someone, the more they long to kill them... to suck their blood.
Those killed in this way also become wurdulak: : : until someone manages to stab them in the heart.
And when are the five days up?
Tonight, at the stroke of midnight.
Thank heavens. It's him!
Yes, it's him.
But how are we to know... whether the five days have passed or not?
- The clock just struck midnight.
- God help us.
Well? Why does no one... come to embrace me?
I'm wounded.
Why do you stare at me and say nothing?
What is the meaning of this silence?
Five days on the mountain... have changed me so... that even my dog doesn't recognize me.
You hear that?
He admits five days have gone by!
Let me wrap your wound.
Go away!
You'll hurt me.
Your wound... it's in the heart.
I'm hungry now.
Do you intend to stay long?
Just for the night.
I'm going to Gersy.
Tell everyone you meet... that old Gorca killed Alibeq.
Of course, if you'd like.
It was a great deed.
Tell us how it went.
He's dead.
There's nothing to tell.
The game is over.
- What's that?
- Lamb.
No meat!
I'm not hungry anymore.
My bones are frozen from the cold, and my throat feels tight.
Somebody go and make that cursed dog shut up!
I told you to shut him up.
Do you no longer follow my orders?
- But it's your favorite dog, Father.
- Kill it!
Kill it!
Ivan.
What's wrong with you, woman?
Are you trying to prevent me from holding my grandson?
Give him to me!
Come, Ivan.
Give Grandpa a big kiss.
Father, it's late.
The child is sleepy.
Go on to bed, Ivan.
Good night.
Do you know, sir, that I found Alibeq's corpse?
How do you know it was really him?
There's no doubt about it.
His clothing, his jewels.
And your dagger.
My dagger?
Do you think that's enough to identify a headless corpse?
No one would be willing to accept this as proof... and people would quake with fear, as they did before.
But I... and I alone have proof that Alibeq is dead.
That's why the dog was howling.
He smelled a corpse.
Take it.
Hang it in front of the house for all to see.
Don't worry, go to sleep.
You too, Sdenka. Go to bed.
I'll keep watch.
I don't think it's necessary.
He's just wounded.
He's not just wounded.
You saw that he wouldn't eat.
Have Pietro take the watch.
You've been awake too many nights.
Maria is right. I'll stay up.
You sleep upstairs with them.
Where are you taking me,
Grandpa?
I have a surprise for you right outside. It's a secret.
Giorgio, Gorca took the child.
Hurry!
Pietro!
Come back!
Give me back my son!
Ivan!
I can't believe it.
Pietro is dead... and perhaps by now the child is too.
It's like a nightmare.
A terrible nightmare
I want to wake up from... but I can't, I can't!
My God!
Sdenka, listen to me.
As long as you stay in this house, the nightmare will never end.
Please, listen.
Run away with me.
No, I can't.
Don't you understand it's madness to stay here?
There are days of terror in store for you here.
You can't throw your life away.
Come away with me, Sdenka!
No, my destiny is here.
That's not true.
Your destiny is to be happy and free... and loved, above all.
Love, happiness.
You speak of things
I can never have again.
But they can be yours.
You can stay with me forever, if you wish.
- It's impossible.
- I love you.
And perhaps one day, when this nightmare is over... you will love me too.
Ivan!
Come now, Maria.
I beg you, don't do it.
Stab me instead.
It's for the peace of his soul.
I did the same to Pietro.
Not him! Not him!
I'm warning you, Giorgio.
If you do it, I'll kill myself!
I won't let you do it, do you hear?
Mama:
I'm cold:
- Is it Ivan?
- No, it's the wind.
- I'm cold:
- For God's sake, Maria, don't listen!
But it's my little boy calling me.
He's cold!
He's dead... dead!
Be reasonable.
You buried him yourself!
Let go of me! I have to let him in.
He's cold.
It's not your son. It's a wurdulak!
I don't care.
Let me go or I'll kill you!
Let me in:
I'm cold:
Don't go.
Come back!
Come, don't be afraid.
We'll be safe in this old convent.
- We should have kept going.
- We're far away. The horse is tired.
Wait here.
We can sleep here.
It may not be very cozy, but as soon as it's light out... we'll go on to Gersy.
What is it?
Nothing.
Sdenka, listen.
Yes, we've run away, but you must try to forget.
If you don't forget, you'll be running forever.
Vladimir, I beg you... try to understand.
How many times do I have to tell you that I love you... and that if you don't find the strength to act... you will destroy your life and mine?
No, I beg you.
Darling, forgive me.
Don't cry.
Father!
Where are you?
You shouldn't have run away.
Why did you do it?
Father, have mercy on me.
Let me live.
This man loves me.
Sdenka, no one can love you more than we do.
My love, I thought...
I didn't expect you.
Why did you leave me?
Why did you come back here?
I did it out of love for you.
They had come to kill you.
Go.
Go now while there's still time.
I must stay here now.
You know I'd rather die than lose you.
Now I know you love me, Vladimir.
I know you love me more than life itself.
My lips are dead without your kisses.
Don't wait any longer.
Kiss me.
Kiss me.
My love.
THE DROP OF WATER
Hello.
Hello? Yes.
Yes, it's me. Good evening.
You want me to come at this hour?
Yes, of course, but...
Couldn't we make it tomorrow morning?
I could come very early.
Come on, please.
Don't be like that.
I don't see the necessity for it.
Yes, all right.
I understand.
Stop it, I said I'm coming.
I told you I'm coming.
Give me time to get there!
What an idiot!
Stupid idiot!
- Who is it?
- It's me. Open up.
Miss Chester, what took you so long?
Don't be ridiculous.
I rushed over.
I ran the whole way.
I'm so frightened.
Believe me, I tried to do it myself, but I couldn't.
Only you can help me.
You're a trained nurse.
What a great idea... with this cursed weather!
- I bet you won't even pay me.
- Don't worry about that.
There are still a few shillings in the house. I'll pay you.
- Couldn't you call a relative?
- You know she didn't have any.
She had no friends, other than the ones who made the table shake.
There she is.
Are you going to stay there?
Aren't you going to help me?
No, miss. Please.
I can't help myself.
Don't ask me to help.
I didn't touch her.
She's just as the doctor left her.
I can see that.
Did you at least get the dress ready?
Yes, of course.
I ironed it, too.
Come with me.
Poor countess.
She died all alone.
She deserved better, believe me.
Just look at this lamp.
Good thing it didn't burn the dress.
- No one will come to the funeral.
- Why not?
- Because they're afraid, that's why.
- Afraid of what?
They say that the spirits of the dead killed her. Ghosts!
- What nonsense.
- Not really, Miss Chester.
It's easy for you to say.
But if you knew how she died...
What do you mean?
She died of a heart attack.
I should know. I kept her going with camphor shots.
It's what the doctor said, too, right?
I know, I know.
But that doesn't mean anything.
The truth is that she died during one of those séances.
While she was in a trance, you see.
She was in a trance!
She'd become obsessed with talking to the dead. Poor woman.
Every Friday she held a séance, come rain or shine.
With a weak heart like hers.
Talking to the dead.
There's a good cure.
Well, let's get this over with.
I need a pair of stockings too.
Right away.
Are you going to spend the night?
No, God forbid.
I'm leaving with you.
Hurry up. I need shoes too.
It won't be easy to find them.
She never went out.
- Did you find them?
- Not yet.
There must be at least one pair.
What happened?
Nothing.
Nothing, don't worry.
I finally found them.
Stay there. Give them here.
Oh, my God! What's happening?
Nothing.
Let's go.
We're done.
Who's there?
Have mercy! Mercy!
So as soon as you heard screaming... you ran upstairs and broke down the door.
Yes. But I wasn't alone, you know.
The neighbors came running too.
We tried pushing on the door, but it was locked.
We kept at it and finally managed to open it.
I saw her dead on the floor, so I made everyone leave.
Nothing has been touched.
I know what to do in cases like this.
I called the police right away.
She had already prepared her nightgown.
Evidently she was about to go to bed.
Death by self-suffocation.
It looks like someone wrenched a ring from her finger.
So there it is.
Didn't you see that end coming?
There's no fooling around with ghosts, because they take revenge.
Well, we've come to the end of our tales... so, sadly, I must leave you now.
But watch out on the way home.
Look around you, look behind you.
Careful when you open the door.
And don't go in without turning on the light!
Dream about me!
We'll become friends!
The La Brea tar pits became traps for all kinds of animals.
They would either wonder out on the tar or be driven into it by their enemies.
The tar would trap them and slowly kill them.
Now, some of you are going to ask:
How did birds get into the pit?
The Vultures and condors fed on whatever had the misfortune to be trapped.
And sometimes the birds themselves got caught in the tar...
... And were pulled down to thier death.
If any of you would like to see where these birds and animals came from...
... the pits are in the Wilshire district of Los Angeles.
Go over there sometime and try to imagine...
... what it was like 40,000 years ago, when monsters like these...
... wandered around, where now expensive cars roam.
Why did huge beasts...
...so much more powerful than man...
... disappeared from the face of Earth, while man...
... a relatively puny thing, survived?
Psst.
Excuse me.  Just a moment.
- What's the trouble, Mr. Van Allen?
- You're wife's on the phone.
But I'm lecturing.
I told her that.
Will you take over for me, Ben?
Yes, of course.
Oh, Cy... where are you?
Explaining how man survived the Pleistocene Age.
How did he?
And why?
Hello honey.  What's the trouble?
The moving men are here, and they're taking the furniture away, again.
Won't they wait?
No, they won't wait.
Not even til tomorrow?
The payments are three months overdue now.
Three months? I distinctly remember...
Somehow you didn't make the payments, Cy...
...But if we can make them now, plus a month in advance....
Let's do that.
How much money do we have in the bank?
About 2 dollars.
Hmm.  I get paid soon.
You don't get paid for almost a month, and we owe it all anyway.
Do you suppose Mr. Van Allen...?
- No.
Mr. Van Allen doesn't make much more than I do...
... And he's got three children.
Oh!   What's the matter?
Nothing.
Good thing we own the mattresses.
Did you get Buck a birthday present?
Ah, Yeah, yeah.
Don't forget to bring it.  Bye.
Bye honey.
Why do they always take our furniture?
Because your father is a wonderful man....just forgetful.
Like me?
Like you, Buck.  Sometimes.
Well the rats and the prends are just useful anyway.
Socks and things.
You gave him that one?
Oh there's nothing wrong with ghost stories, daddy.
Unless that's all you read.
He's got every spooky book ever printed.
Ow!  Hey!
Do you believe in ghosts, Buck?
Sure.
You want some cake?
Cake?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No no no.  You've got to make a wish first.
I already have.
Well, how will anybody know if your wish comes true, if you don't wish out loud?
Suppose I don't want to anyone to know.
Then you wished for something bad.
I have not, Medea.
Well, If you can't wish out loud, then there must be something wrong with it.
Don't you want us to know what you're wish is, darling?
I wished we had a house with furniture, that nobody could take away from us.
Mr. Cyrus Zorba?
A telegram for you.
"With regards to matter of great importance to you...
... you are requested to present yourself in the office of attorney Benjamin Rush...
... tomorrow morning at 10 oclock.
Signed, Benjamin Rush"
Who?
Benjamin Rush, attorney.
Well it's not anybody we owe.
At least I don't think so.
Could be the lawyer from a collection agency.
Oh.  Could be.
What are you going to do?
Go. What else?
Suppose you just run away?
Why run away, before you find out what's chasing you?
Well, I read about a man waited to find out...
... But he never did, because it ate him.
Benjamin Rush, attorney at law.
Ooh, he's in the Petro building.
You have'nt done anything you could be arrested for, have you daddy?
No.
Not lately.
So, you inherit the house, which is the bulk of the estate.
- Furnished?
- Ah, yes.
It's pretty old-fashioned, but is furniture.
Is Buck pshycic or something?
Ma'am?
Our ten year old son, Buck.
His birthday wish was for a house with furniture.
Yeah.
What sort of a house is it?
I affraid you're gonna be disappointed, Mr Zorba.
It's one of those sprawling old mansions they built 50 years ago.
Well, that's better than a third mortgage and no furniture.
Well, don't decide to move in until you've seen it.
Here's the key and the address.
This is really strange.
I thought my uncle  died
10, 12 years ago in India or someplace.
No.  He died here last week.
Everything about your uncle was strange.
Including his will.
Is that the rich uncle you used to talk about before we got married?
Uh huh.  And he's been here, in Los Angeles, all these years...
... And didn't let me know?
Well, he wanted the world to think he was dead.
He left you this, too.
What is it?
I don't know.
Is this all?  The house and the package?   No other...
Well there's no money, if that's what you mean, Ma'am.
Dr. Zorba must have been quite wealthy, at one time.
Apparently, he spent it all on his experiments.
I seem to remember he was fooling around with the occult.
Spirits from the other world.
Ghosts.
Dr. Zorba  collected ghosts from all over the world.
You inherit them, too.
Come on.
They go with the house.
I'll get a notary.
Cy, this is too much.
A mysterious uncle rising from the grave...
... The old mansion, complete with ghosts.
Is it a gag?
I did have an uncle named Plato Zorba.
And here's his last will and testament.
I want to see what's in the package?
Wouldn't it be lovely if it was just full of stocks or bonds.
Or just plain money.
Yeah.
Think we ought to open it?
Well, he said it was yours.
Suppose it has to do with those experiments.
You know.  You open the box and all that trouble comes out.
Pandora.
It's probably a hand painted Christmas tie.
Open it.
You open it.
Oh, hi.
Hello.  Are you Buck?
Yeah.
I'm Ben Rush.
You're the lawyer.
Uh Hm.  Are you all moved in?
Wasn't anything to move, except us.
It's a great house.
Furniture all over....books.
There's a lot of it I haven't even seen yet.
It's got ghosts.
So I hear.
Know about em'?
Well, I've heard a lot about em'.
You ever seen one?
No.  Is your father home?
He will be soon.  We got a witch too.
A live one?
Go ring the bell.
She'll come to the door.
Oh, shucks.
What did you have to open the door for?
Couoldn't you wait for the witch?
You better stop calling her that, or she'll cut your tongue out.
Hi, i'm Medea Zorba.
Hi.
Won't you come in?
I told you.  She's even got a broom.
I see what you mean.
You must be Ben Rush, the lawyer.
Um hmm.
Mmm.  No skates.  We own this house.
Or do we?
It's your house.
Who's boss around here?
In the "no skates" department, I am.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Was the my father's uncle?
Um hm.
He was a fine looking man.
I never saw him like that.
By the time I met him, they'd almost completely destroyed him.
They?
His ghosts.
Oh, Benjamin Rush, attorney at law.
Living in the twentieth century?
Plato Zorba, scientist, same century.
Collected ghosts.
You're not serious?
I didn't believe in them any more than you do, until I'd known him a while.
You can take my word for him.
There are ghosts in this house.
We're standing here talking as if you thought we were in the Middle Ages.
But if you had seen him as I did...
...back broken...
...face torn to shreds...
... lips ripped away...
You really think we inherited a haunted house?
I wish your family hadn't moved in.
Oh, hello, Mr. Rush.
Hi.
Hi, honey.
Here are the rest of those papers, all signed and notarized.
But I... What about the taxes.
The insurance.  This housekeeper?
Why don't we ask Mr. Rush to stay for supper?
Well I'd love to.
Even if you do call me Mr. Rush.
I'll tell mother... Ben.
You the head of this department too?
You walk down.  You don't slide.
You know something?  If you don't watch out, you're gonna grow up to be a witch.
For a guy with no money, he sure could get complicated.
Well, we've got ourselves a house.
The timing was perfect.
More coffee, Ben?
No thanks.
Daddy?
Please, dear.
What have youo decided to do about the witch?
We mustn't call her that.
It's a perfect name.
You know, I have a feeling she doesn't like me much.
I have a feeling she doesn't like anybody much.
We told her we couldn't pay her, and didn't need her....
... But she asked us if she could stay on here, til shefound something else.
Practically begged us.
I guess she's got some money of her own.
After all, she lived here for years...
... And Dr. Zorba paid her a good salary.
Hey, look what I found.
What does "ui-ja" mean?
Why, I haven't seen one of these for years.
It's a ouija board.  See?
"Oui"  French for yes.
"Ja" German for yes.
How to play it?
Where'd you find it?
Over there.
I pushed something on the fireplace and it opened.
There's a gadget that goes with it, Buck.
I think they call it a  "planchette".
I pushed this.
Here it is.
Looks like it might be old Latin.
How do you use this, Daddy?
"Ouija, the mystifying oracle.
Most  modern method of fortune telling.
Anybody want to try?
I have a friend at the university who can probably translate this.
I'll take it over to him tomorrow.
My boss, Mr. Van Allen, talks Latin in his sleep.
If he can't translate it, no one can.
You want your fortune told?
Now, here's how it works.
Everybody puts one finger on this.
Just lightly.
Then, somebody asks a question.
We all concentrate on it, and the Ouija will answer it.
Oh, come on Cy.
It will.  It's magic.
Come on.  Everybody put a finger on it.
Okay.  Just lightly.
Okay.  Now somebody ask a question.
Oh.  By the way.
If you ask a silly question, it won't answer.
Ben, you ask a question.
Alright.
Here's the question.
Is Medea in love?
Concentrate now.
No cheating.
You see?
It was a silly question.
Can I ask a question, Daddy?
All right, Buck.
Lightly.
Are there any ghosts in this house?
I was pushing toward "No", but you all ganged up on me.
No, I was helping you, Ben.
And I think this is silly.
You don't want to play?
It's rigged. how can you say that after what you told me this afternoon?
That's a toy.
You want to play, Daddy?
I think I'll go along with Hilda and Ben.
Let's stop.
Do you want to try it with me, Buck?
You ask the question, Buck.
How many?
How many what?
It knows.
Thirteen what?
Ghosts.
You ask it.
Are they going to hurt us?
Don't fool around with that thing anymore, Medea.
Let's ask it,  but don't touch it.
You ask it.
Are they going to kill any of us?
Don't ask it when.
I don't want to know.
But it was just floating in the air.
There was nothing touching it.
There's probably a very simple explanation for it.
I don't know what it could be.
Oh, Cy.  I'm frightened.
Of what?
A silly game?
Ghosts.
Oh now listen, honey.
Maybe Zorba was a very strange man who...
... could see ghosts and do supernatural things.
But we aren't him.
We're just ordinary people who don't have any supernatural powers and...
...don't want any.
Here it is.
The codicil 11.
If we don't elect to live in this house...
... it goes to the state as part of a park system.
And once we move in, we have to stay.
You mean we can't sell it even if we want to?
Nope.
If we don't live here, it goes to the state.  Golly.
Living in this house make a difference between sinking and swimming.
Just not paying rent saves half salary.
- Cy, why is it so cold?
- I do not know.
Window open I guess.
But it's freezing!
What's that?
The wind probably.
I'll say goodnight to the children.
Leave the door open!
Okay.
Yeah.
- Medea.
Come in.
Hi.
Hi.
Old Doc Zorba sure went in for antiques, didn't he?
I sort of like them.
I hope you're not too upset by... what happened.
Just a game.
I know.   Silly, wasn't  it?
I think all this spook talk of Ben's is...got us all imagining things.
Daddy?
Yes, darling.
Do you really think there are ghosts in this house?
Oh.  Of course not.
Now.  It's time for all pretty girls to go to sleep.
Good night.
Don't worry.
I'll leave this open.
Fine.
All clear on the off spring front.
I'm going down and get a book.
Be back in a minute.
Thirteen...
Thirteen...
Thirteen...
Thirteen...
Any luck?
Luck?
Can't you read it, Van?
Yes I can read it.  It's Latin.
Well...What's it about?
What's it about?
Cy.
At first I thought your uncle was another one of those fakes.
But now I'm not so sure.
Here.
I found this in the university publications.
It's printed 10 years ago.
" The Professor who advertises for haunted houses...
... so he can photograph ghosts ...
... is Dr. Plato Zorba, a scientist of unquestioned repute.
Dr. Zorba's experience with ghosts in many parts of the world...
... convinced him they are unhappily earth bound ...
... because of unsolved problems.
Dr. Zorba has perfected a device with which he can see ghosts...
... and is working on a method of ultraviolet ray photography...
... which will enable him to take permanent pictures...
... of the supernatural world. "
He wasn't a fake.
This....this is a record of years of work in the world of spirits.
If any of this is true,
I don't say all, just any of it...
... then your uncle had penetrated farther into the supernatural...
... than any man in history.
He captured 11 ghosts.
Captured?
Dr. Zorba proved, that if you could see a ghost, you could control it...
... to a certain extent.
Yes, I think so.
There is a section describing exactly how he made the lenses for those glasses.
It took him years.
And then traveled all over the world.
He found one ghost in a castle in Ireland.
Another one in the catacombs below Rome.
He caught one in a village in Italy.
Another one in Tibet.
I wonder which ones I saw last night.
Each ghost has a separate section.
This is the last one...
... Ghost 12.
You said 11.
Twelve.
"I, Plato Zorba, am the 12th...
Earth bound not for the crimes I've committed...
... but for crimes committed against me...
... and which I shall revenge before I be released...
... from haunting the Earth ".
And here's a curious thing... he wrote, "ghost 13".
The rest of the page is blank.
Paleontology. Van Allen.
Yes.  Hold on.
Oh.  Hello?
Cy?  I want you to come home.
I'm pretty busy, honey.
What's the trouble?
There is no use trying to tell you.
I want you to come home right away.
Cy?
I'm on my way.
I've got to go home, Van.
The ghosts?
I don't know.
Have they hurt anyone?
I don't know.
Hilda?
Hilda!
Hilda!
You.. you alright?
The kids?
Well then?
You come in here.
Well, what happened?
They came off the shelves and broke.
You mean they..they fell off?
They came off!
I've had enough, Cy.
Stop it!   Stop it I say!
That was Emilio.
Who?
Emilio. He was an Italian chef.
They killed his wife.
He killed his mother in law too.
And his sister in law.
With a meat cleaver.
Whack.  Whack.  Whack.
You better stand over there.
What for?
He doesn't mess up the kitchen often...
... But when it does, wow!
Now Emilio is through.
Now I'm through.
Who told you all this?
The witch. Elaine.
She knows alot we don't know.
Like what?
- Well...
... She knows most of the ghosts.
She's even seen some of em'.
She's about the creepiest person I've ever met.
Don't you think so?
Well, she's uh...different.
Maybe she one of the ghosts herself.
What then?
Ooohhh.
Suppose they hurt one of the children.
I don't think they would.
A few more inches and that cleaver would have cut off your head.
And look at the burn on your hand.
So how can you say that they won't hurt Buck or Medea, or you again?
Things will calm down, Hilda.
Oh, Cy, let's get out of here.
We're in danger.
You sent for me?
Yes, Elaine.
There are some questions
I'd like to ask you.
How long did you work for Dr. Zorba?
For many years.
You knew about his experiments with the supernatural?
I helped him.
When he was alive, he could control them, but now...
I'm afraid...
I never was before...
... But now I am.
I can't help feeling that our living here...
... everything that has happened to us is all part of a plan...
... That Dr. Zorba wants us to do something.
But what?
I can't help you.
He used to trust me, and in those days I helped him...
... with the cameras and lenses.
But towards the last... he trusted no one.
Were you and Ben the only friends he had?
Ben only.    He turned against me.
He was doing foolish things and
I wanted him to stop, but he would not.
His experiments?
Those too.
But mainly I objected when he converted everything into cash.
Stocks, bonds, real estate, everything.
And then he withdrew all his accounts from the banks.
It was foolish.
What did he do with the money?
No one knows.
There is no record of it.
Ben and I spent days searching the house for it after he died, but found nothing.
Maybe he spent it.
On what?  He had everything he needed.
Besides, he never left the house.
Maybe he gave it away.
I knew Plato Zorba very well.
He never gave away anything.
This house is not a gift, really.
It's a burden.  Perhaps a curse.
The last thing he wrote...
...was about a crime committed against him.
What did he mean by that?
I don't know.
How did he die, Elaine?  And where?
I'll show you.
I'll stay here.
This was Dr. Zorba's bedroom.
That is where he died.
How did he die, Elaine?
The spirits from the other world.
Is that what you told the coroner?
He wouldn't have believed me any more than you.
The official cause of death was suffication.
Who saw him last?
I mean, was anyone here when he died?
I was here, in the house, but I didn't see him that night at all.
He and Ben were working on his will.
Did Ben see him die?
Oh no.  Ben had gone.
Dr. Zorba died sometime later that night.
I found him the next morning there.
What did the police say about it?
They talked mostly to Ben.
I called him first.
I hated this room.
For years I never came in here.
But that morning I did.
I don't know why.
Something seemed to be pulling me to this place.
If you stay here, you too, will learn not to come into this room.
What do you mean,
"if I stay here"?
You should get out of this house now!
Tonight!
It was a wonderful evening, Ben.
Thanks.
How about some coffee before you go?
No Thanks.  Not tonight.
I wish you and your family were staying somewhere else.
This place gives me the creeps.
It always has.
Don't start on that again.
I worry about you, Medea.
Just for me, will you try to be a little careful?
For you, I'll pull the covers over my head tonight.
See you tomorrow?
Well, I hope so.
Don't worry, Ben.  I'll be careful.
Thanks again. Good night.
Good night.
Daddy, Daddy!
Darling.  Darling.
What happened?
Come in here .
Oh, good morning.
Well, how is she?
I'm getting her breakfast now. godd thing there were some of those pills left.
Did you call Buck?
Yeah.  Yeah, I yelled as I went by.
Back you lion, back!
I'm Shadrack the Great.
Back!
Down you lion, down!
I'm Shadrack!
I met a lion.
That's good.
And a man without a head.
Mmm Hmm
Now you take this to up to Medea, dear.
And then you come back and eat your own breakfast, hmm?
Morning, Buck.
Hi, Ben.
Medea is in bed.
She saw a ghost last night.
I just saw a lion and a man without a head.
What do you know.
No head at all?
I think the lion bit it off because the man was looking for her.
I've got some papers for your dad.
He's gone to work.
I have to bring Medea her breakfast.
Buck?
Hmm?
Where did you get all that money?
I found it on the floor.
When?
Just before you rang the bell.
Exactly where did you find it?
Right there.
Exactly?
Somewhere around there.
Think it belongs to some ghost?
Well you found it.
It belongs to you.
You mean I can keep it?
Sure.
It was just laying on the floor?
Just those two?
That's a lot of money, $ 200.
Buck.
What were you doing just before you found the money?
Skating?
No skating in the house.
Sliding down the bannister?
Are you going to tell Medea?
Well, we're pals.
Don't you know that?
I keep your secrets and you keep mine.
Okay?
Okay.
But I don't have any secrets.
Well I'll give you one.
You take Medea's breakfast up to her and then come right back.
And don't tell her I'm here.
Promise?
I can keep a secret.
And don't say anything about finding the money.
I'll be right back.
Here's your breakfast.
I just saw a lion and a man without a head.
What did you see last night?
An apperition.  At the window.
Do we have them too?
I guess we're the only family in the whole world...
... with thier own apparition and ghosts.
Why don't you get up?
As long as you bring me breakfast in bed, why should I get up?
Where's mother?
In the kitchen.
Where's Elaine?
I don't know.  Well, I got to go.
What's so important?
Got to keep a secret.
What secret, Buck?
You didn't tell her?
Nope.
Good man.
Now I'm gonna tell you the biggest secret you ever heard.
If you promise not to tell a living soul.
I won't even tell a ghosts, and the're not living.
There's a treasure hidden in this house.
Pirates?
Sort of.
Before old Dr. Zorba died, he hid all his money.
This must be some of it.
Well there's alot more, and you and I are gonna find it.
If Medea will get up, we'll make her hunt too.
No, no. That's the secret.
You and I are going to find the money all by ourselves.
Aren't we gonna give dad any?
Or mother or Medea?
We're gonna give it all to them.
But let me ask you this...
Suppose we have to uh... maybe cut a hole in the wall someplace.
Now, if you told your dad, what would he say? well, he might not understand.
That's why this has to be just between you and me.
Okay.  When do we start?
First, you've got to hide that.
Next, I've got to make some plans.
And tonight we start.
Maybe I could hunt around some today!
Okay. But be careful.
If anybody comes in while you're hunting, you act like nothing is happening.
Now, don't tell anybody about finding the money.
And don't tell anybody about the treasure hunt. and Buck...
... Don't tell anybody I was here this morning.
Right?
Right.
Ben?
Suppose somebody asks me... right straight out...
"Was Ben here today?"
I wasn't here, Buck.
Now that's the way it has to be.
Who was that, Buck?
Huh?
Who went out?
Nobody, Medea.
And besides, it's a secret.
Come in.
Hello, Ben.
If you're busy,  I can come back later.
No no.
I'm glad you're here.
I wanna talk to you.
Sit down.
Ben, we've been in that house two nights.
The first, I got this.
Last night, they attacked Medea.
Medea!
They didn't hurt her.
Why Medea?
Was she wearing those glasses Zorba made?
No.. no she wasn't.
What's going to happen, Ben?
Is my family going to be terrorized every night?
Maybe this is the answer, Cy.
I think I can legally get the state to pay you for the house and grounds...
But the will said...
You've only been in the house three days.
The longest days in my life.
I bet you'll be glad to get your family out of there.
See, we can say you never actually took possession.
Now how soon can you move?
Right away,  I guess.
Good.
If I we're you I wouldn't spend another night in that house, under any circumstances.
Zorba, Paleontology.
Oh, hi ya, Buck.
Yes, yes.  It's alright.
A secret?
Well, tell me about it, son.
Alright, Buck.   Just as you say.
See you later.
Buck's all excited.
Any trouble?
He's got a secret.
A big surprise for me.
What is it?
He wouldn't tell me.
I think you could cut his arm off, and he still wouldn't tell.
Good kid.
Well,  can you move today?
We haven't much to move, except ourselves.
I think I'll be able to get you $ 10,000 from the state.
Hey, Cy. This will interest you.
Oh.  So sorry.
I can speak to you later.
No, no, Van.   Stay.
Ben Rush,  this is my boss,  Mr. Van Allen.
How do you do, sir?
How do you do.
Listen to this.
Almost the last thing Dr. Zorba wrote.
"Today I finished converting my assets into cash...
... and put it where unscrupulous men can no longer steal it from me."
I wonder where that is.
If he never left the house?
Don't forget...he wrote this about... only a month ago.
What do you think, Ben?
Maybe we shouldn't be in such a hurry to move.
Well it isn't likely.  I handled Zorba's affairs for a year.
I don't think he could've kept any large amount of money secret from me.
Well, after reading this, I wouldn't be surprised at anything...
... natural or supernatural, Zorba did.
For instance, he spoke with the spirits of the dead like uh...
... you and I chat with the grocer.
He and a medium called
Elaine Zacharides...
...used to sit around at a Séance...
... talking with people dead for 5 centuries.
All you have to do is find Elaine Zacharides.
I don't have to find her.
She's the housekeeper.
Would she hold a Séance with you?
I don't know.
I doubt it.
She's pretty stubborn.
Anyway, you're moving out so there won't be time.
But, if she'd do it, we'd take time.
Maybe..maybe she'd hold a Séance tonight.
Then we could move out tomorrow.
If we could bring the spirit of Zorba back...
... I wonder what we'd find out.
What's a Séance?
You talk to spirits.
Buck, why don't you go and pack your things?
How does it work?
I do not know.
Hand me the dress, will you?
How does Elaine know?
I do not know.
Oh, I'll be so glad to get out of this house.
Well, what happens?
Oh, you sit around the table holding hands.
Buck, will please go and help mother?
What good does that do?
The spirits talk to you.
What do they say?
I do not know.
Buck, will you please go!
Why pack?
We're not going to anywhere.
You heard dad.
Were leaving first thing in the morning.
Medea?
Yes, Buck.
Suppose you had a secret.
How you would keep it?
You have a secret?
What is it?
Well, it's a...
Hey, I'm not going to tell you what it is.
Well who is it with?
Ben.
Oh.
What's it about?
Well, is it alright to say what it's about?
Sure, as long as you don't tell the secret itself.
Well, you see, Ben and I...
Need any help?
No, I just finished packing, mom.
Good.   If it weren't for this Séance nonsense, we could leave right now.
I can go to the Séance, can't I mom?
Absolutely not.
Aw, I've never been to one.
It'll be fun.
Boy, maybe somebody will get murdered.
Well you can't go to this one.
Anyway, it's past  your bed time.
I'll tell you everything that happens.
Yeah well, that's not like seeing it.
Right in here. We're ready to start.
Will you sit there, Mr. Zorba?
Your wife here, your daughter here.
The most important thing, is concentration.
Let your minds think of nothing except  bringing back to this room...
... the spirit of Zorba.
We will now join hands.
Cy, do you think this is really necessary?
Please, honey.
What can we expect ?
I mean, what will happen?
Perhaps nothing.  Perhaps anything.
Doctor Zorba and I experienced total recall with some spirits.
With others we could make no contact at all.
If he comes back, he may speak through me...
... or he may choose one of you
One of us?
Yes.   Although I'm the medium, he may choose one of you.
He may even appear.
There's no way to tell.
What can happen?
I mean, say he does come.
Can we carry on a conversation?
It's possible.
Let us try for just a short time.
It's very difficult being a medium.
And dangerous.
Besides, as I told you, Dr. Zorba no longer trusted me.
Now will you please turn out the lights.
And then we must all concentrate.
Just...just a moment, please.
Ready?
The treasure!
Buck.   You're suppose to be in bed.
I...uh...
All we're doing is sitting around the table. Nothing is happening.
I'm not trying to see your old ghosts.
I'm waiting for Ben.
We've got a secret.
Ben?  He's not coming here tonight.
He might.
Is a pretty big secret.
Yes.  You told me.
But it can wait until tomorrow.
Can't I wait up five more minutes, if I promise not to peek?
Okay. Five minutes.
I'm sorry.
Dr. Zorba...
Dr. Zorba...
Dr. Zorba...
Dr. Zorba...
Zorba...
Zorba..
In death...
In death...
Do not move!
No matter what happens, do not move.
Ben, I found it!  Come on.
See?
Good work, Buck.  Good work.
Does anybody else know?
Of course not.  Let's tell em'.   Ow!
You're hurting!
Oh, I'm sorry, Buck.
We can't tell anyone yet.
But we're moving out tomorrow.
That's right.  We've got to get ready...
... so when they're all set to go... bam!  We give them money.
Then we won't have to move.
Right.   Now, we got alot to do tomorrow.
I think you better turn in, Buck.
You know.  Get all the rest you can.
I'm not sleepy.
Not sleepy?
I'm gonna be waking you so early in the morning...
... the sun won't even be up.
We've got work to do.
And then we'll em'?
Tomorrow. So, sleep now.
I'm gonna hit the sack myself.
Okay.   Good night.
You can wake me anytime.
I won't mind.
Good night, Buck.
Go right to sleep.
Cy!   Help him!
No!  You mustn't!   Stay where you are!
Thirteen, thirteen...
Dead tonight...
... One of you...
Are you alright?
Bring him back.  Please.
We must know more.
It is of no use.
There is Interference.
The ghosts are restless, angry.
Tonight death walks again...
... in this evil house.
Suddenly I...I  became cold.
And for an instant,
I seemed to black out.
And then...
... then I heard a strange voice come from me...
But I can't remember.
You... I mean the voice said...
"Death tonight" and then the number 13.
And then he...
... he said it would be one of us.
- Where are you going?
Oh.  Just to see if Buck's alright.
It's Ben!  It's Ben!
The bed it's hurting him!
... 98, 99, hundred!
I never thought I'd get tired of this.
Daddy?   Why did Ben dress as Zorba's ghost...
...and appear at my window?
He was trying to frighten you.
He knew this money was hidden here.
After he murdered Zorba he tried to find it.
Then we moved in.  He wanted us out of here.
Where do you think our new house ought to be?
New house?
What do we want with a new house?
Boo.  Boo.
Buck!
Buck! Take that thing off.
Can I keep it?
Breakfast is ready.
Well,  I'm starved.
Elaine.   Do you think there are still ghosts is this house?
No.  The earthbound spirits have been released.
Don't you want your breakfast?
I'm guarding the money.
Elaine?
Yes, Buck.
You really are a witch, aren't you?
Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies.
And the ghosts?  They haven't really gone, have they?
They'll be back.
They'll be back.
Real soon, I hope.
They ought to make the day the time changes the first day of summer.
- What?
- Well, it's 8 o'clock and it's still light.
A lot of good the extra daylight does us.
Now, we've still got a three-hour drive back.
We're not gonna be home until after midnight.
Well, if it really bugged you, Johnny, you wouldn't do it.
You think I wanna blow Sunday on a scene like this?
You know, I figure we're either gonna have to move Mother out here, or move the grave into Pittsburgh.
- She can't make a trip like this.
- Oh, I don't know that she can't.
Is there any of that candy left?
No.
Look at this thing. "We still remember."
I don't. You know, I don't even remember what the man looks like.
Johnny, it takes you five minutes.
Yeah, five minutes to put the wreath on the grave and six hours to drive back and forth.
Mother wants to remember, so we trot 200 miles into the country
- and she stays at home.
- Well, we're here, John. All right?
Testing. Are we back on?
Oh. Uh, ladies and gentlemen...
Hey, do...
we're coming back on the air after an interruption due to technicalprobl...
There's nothing wrong with the radio.
Must've been the station.
Which row is it in?
Boy, there's no one around.
Well, it's late.
If you'd gotten up earlier...
Oh, look, I already lost an hour's sleep on the time change.
I think you complain just to hear yourself talk.
There it is.
I wonder what happened to the one from last year.
Each year we spend good money on these things.
We come out here, and the one from last year is gone.
Well, the flowers die, and the caretaker or somebody takes them away.
Yeah, a little spit and polish, he can clean this up, sell it next year.
Wonder how many times we've bought the same one.
Hey, come on, Barb.
Church was this morning, huh?
Hey, I mean, praying's for church, huh?
Come on.
I haven't seen you in church lately.
Well, there's not much sense in my going to church.
Do you remember one time when we were small, we were out here?
It was from right over there.
I jumped out at you from behind a tree, and Grandpa got all excited, and he shook his fist at me and he said,
"Boy, you'll be damned to hell."
Remember that? Right over there.
You used to really be scared here.
Johnny.
Hey, you're still afraid.
Stop it now. I mean it.
They're coming to get you, Barbra.
Stop it! You're ignorant!
They're coming for you, Barbra.
Stop it. You're acting like a child.
They're coming for you.
Look! There comes one of them now!
- He'll hear you.
- Here he comes now.
- I'm getting out of here.
- Johnny!
No!
No! Johnny!
Help me! Help!
It's all right.
Don't worry about him. I can handle him.
Probably be a lot more of them as soon as they find out about us.
Truck is out of gas.
This pump out here is locked. Is there a key?
We can try to get out of here if we can get some gas. Is there a key?
I suppose you've tried this.
Do you live here?
Jesus.
We've gotta get out of here.
We have to get to where there are some other people.
M-Maybe we better take some food.
I'll see if I can find some food.
- What's happening?
- I'll be just a second.
What's happening?
Two of them.
There are two of them out there.
Have you seen any more around here?
- I can take care of those two.
- I don't know. I don't know.
- I know you're afraid, but we have to...
- I don't know! I don't know!
What's happening?
They know we're in here now.
Don't look at it.
Get some more lights on in this house.
Why don't you see if you can find some wood, some boards, something there by the fireplace, something we can nail this place up.
Look, goddamn it...
Look. I know you're afraid.
I'm afraid too.
But we have to try to board the house up together.
Now, I'm going to board up the windows and the doors. Do you understand?
We'll be all right here.
We'll be all right here till someone comes to rescue us.
But we have to work together.
You'll have to help me.
Now, go in and get some wood so I can board the place up.
Do you understand? Okay?
Okay?
That'll hold 'em.
Those things aren't that strong.
Here, I want you to pick out some nails.
Pick out the biggest ones you can find.
There. This room looks pretty secure.
If we have to, we can run in here and board up the doors.
Won't be long before those things'll be back, pounding their way in here. They're afraid now.
They're afraid of fire. I found that out.
You know a place back down the road called Beekman's? Beekman's Diner?
Anyhow, that's where I found that truck
I have out there.
There's a radio in the truck.
I had jumped in to listen to it... when a big gasoline truck came screaming right across the road.
Well, there must have been
10, 15 of those things chasing after it, grabbing and holding on.
I didn't see them at first.
I could just see that the truck was moving in a funny way.
And those things were catching up to it.
Truck went right across the road.
Slammed on my brakes to keep from hitting it myself.
It went right through the guardrail.
I guess...
I guess the driver must have cut off the road, into that gas station by Beekman's Diner.
It went right through the billboard, ripped over a gas pump and never stopped moving.
By now it was like a moving bonfire.
Didn't know if the truck was going to explode or what.
I can still hear the man screaming... these things just backing away from it.
I looked back at the diner to see if there was anyone there who could help me.
That was when I noticed that... the entire place had been encircled.
Wasn't a sign of life left, except...
By now, there were no more screams.
I realized that...
I was alone, with 50 or 60 of those things just standing there, staring at me.
I-I started to drive. I... just plowed right through them.
They didn't move. They didn't run or...
Just stood there, staring at me.
I just wanted to crush them.
They... scattered through the air, like bugs.
We were riding in the cemetery...
Johnny and me.
Johnny.
We...
We came to put a wreath on my father's grave,
Johnny and m...
And he said,
"Can I have some candy, Barbra?"
And we didn't have any.
And...
Oh, it's hot in here.
Hot.
Uh, and he said,
"Oh, it's late.
Why did we start so late?"
And I said,
"Johnny, if you'd gotten up earlier, we wouldn't be late."
Johnny asked me if I were afraid.
And I said, "I'm not afraid, Johnny."
And then this man started walking up the road.
He came slowly, and Johnny kept teasing me and saying,
"He's coming to get you, Barbra."
And I laughed at him and said,
"Johnny, stop it."
And then Johnny ran away.
And I...
I went up to this man, and I was going to apologize.
Why don't you just keep calm?
And I looked up, and... and I said, "Good eve..."
And he grabbed me.
He grabbed me!
And he ripped at me!
He held me and he ripped at my clothes!
I think you should just calm down.
Oh, I screamed, "Johnny!
Johnny, help me!
Oh, help me!"
And he wouldn't let me go.
He ripped...
And then Johnny came, and he ran, and he... he fought this man.
And I got so afraid, I ran.
I ran.
I ran.
And Johnny didn't come.
We've got... We have to wait for Johnny.
Maybe we'd better go out and get him.
We have to go out and get Johnny.
He's out there.
Please! Don't you hear me?
We've got to go out and get him.
Please!
We have got to go get Johnny!
Please help me!
Please!
Don't you know what's going on out there?
This is no Sunday school picnic.
Don't you understand? My brother is alone!
- Your brother is dead.
- No!
My brother is not dead!
No!
Because of the obvious threat to untold numbers of citizens,
and because of the crisis which is even now developing,
this radio station will remain on the air, day and night.
This station and hundreds of other radio and TV stations
throughout this part of the country
are pooling their resources through an emergency network hookup
to keep you informed of all developments.
At this hour, we repeat, these are the facts as we know them.
There is an epidemic of mass murder being committed
by a virtual army of unidentified assassins.
The murders are taking place in villages, cities, rural homes, and suburbs
with no apparent pattern or reason for the slayings.
It seems to be a sudden, general explosion of mass homicide.
We have some descriptions of the assassins.
Eyewitnesses say they are ordinary-looking people.
Some say they appear to be in a kind of trance.
Others describe them as being...
So, at this point there is no really authentic way for us to say
who or what to look for and guard yourself against...
misshapen monsters.
Reaction of law enforcement officials is one of complete bewilderment at this hour.
So far we have been unable to determine
that any kind of organized investigation is yet under way.
Police, sheriffs' deputies and emergency ambulances
are literally deluged with calls for help.
The scene can best be described as mayhem.
Mayors of Pittsburgh,
Philadelphia, and Miami,
along with the governors of several
Eastern and Midwestern states,
have indicated the national guard may be mobilized at any moment,
but that has not happened as yet.
The only advice our reporters have been able to get from official sources
is for private citizens to stay in their homes behind locked doors.
Do not venture outside for any reason
until the nature of this crisis has been determined
and until we can advise what course of action to take.
Keep listening to radio and TV
for any special instructions as this crisis develops further.
Thousands of office and factory workers
are being urged to stay at their places of employment,
not to make any attempt to get to their homes.
However, in spite of this urging and warning,
streets and highways are packed with frantic people trying to reach their families,
or apparently to flee just anywhere.
We repeat: The safest course of action at this time is simply to stay where you...
Ladies and gentlemen, we've just received word
that the president has called a meeting of his cabinet
to deal with the sudden epidemic of murder
which has seized the eastern third of this nation.
The meeting is scheduled to convene within the hour.
Members of the presidential cabinet
will be joined by officials of the FBI and the joint chiefs behind closed doors.
A White House spokesman, in announcing this conference,
says there will be an official announcement as soon as possible following that meeting.
This is the latest dispatch just received in our newsroom.
Latest word also from national press services in Washington, DC, now tells us
that the emergency presidential conference which we've just mentioned
will include high-ranking scientists
from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
That's the extent of this latest...
All radio and TV stations across the eastern part of the country,
including the one to which you are listening,
have joined their facilities in an emergency network
to bring you this news as it develops.
We urge you to stay tuned to radio and TV and to stay indoors at all costs.
Late reports reaching this newsroom tell of frightened people
seeking refuge in churches, schools, and government buildings,
demanding shelter and protection from the wholesale murder
which apparently is engulfing much of the nation.
Law enforcement officials are at a loss to explain or, even at this hour,
even to theorize about the reasons for this wave of murder.
So far, all they're able to give the public is something similar to the response
of Chief T.K. Dunmore of Camden, North Carolina,
who is quoted as saying, quote,
"Tell the people, for God's sake, to get off the streets.
Tell 'em to go home and lock their doors and windows up tight.
We don't know what kind of murder-happy characters we have here."
End quote. That's Chief Dunmore of Camden, North Carolina.
So far the only descriptions, the only clues anyone has of the killers
come from frightened witnesses.
These eyewitness accounts variously describe the murderers as "ordinary looking people, "
"misshapen monsters,"
"people who look like they're in a trance, "
and "things that look like people but act like animals."
Some eyewitnesses tell of seeing victims
who look as though they had been torn apart.
This whole ghastly story began developing two days ago
with the report of the slaying of a family of seven
in their rural home near Gulfport, Louisiana.
Since then, reports of some senseless killings began snowballing
in a reign of terror which has hopscotched in an erratic and disconnected pattern
throughout much of the eastern and midwestern United States.
Efforts to keep track of the murder reports by the placing of markers on a map
seem to indicate a general spreading from the extreme southeastern United States
to the north and west.
Our newsmen have been on the telephone, talking with officials in other cities,
and have determined that none of this kind of mass murder
has yet been reported west of the Mississippi River,
except in the extreme southeastern portion of Texas.
Similar killings have been reported around the Houston and Galveston areas,
- but nothing like the...
- I found a gun and some bullets out there.
- It was only late yesterday...
- Oh, and these.
That it soon became clear that we were facing some kind of national emergency.
When first reports began filtering in,
newsmen and law enforcement agencies were of the opinion...
This place is boarded up pretty solid now.
We ought to be all right here for a while.
We have the gun and the bullets, food and the radio.
...began to suspect
an obscure kind of conspiracy.
Sooner or later, someone's bound to come and get us out.
...creatures from outer space.
Again, we join with law enforcement agencies in urging you to seek shelter in a building.
Lock the doors and windows securely.
Hey, that's us. We're doing all right.
Be cautious of any suspicious strangers,
and keep tuned to your radio and television for survival instructions
and further details of this continuing story.
Look, I don't know if you're hearing me... but I'm going upstairs now.
It's almost as though some critical balance...
If anything should try to break in here,
I can hear it from up there.
I'll be down to take care of it.
We repeat: This radio station...
Everything is all right for now. I'll be back to reinforce the windows and doors later.
But you'll be all right for now. Okay?
Okay?
Civil defense officials in Cumberland have told newsmen
that murder victims show evidence of having been
partially devoured by their murderers.
Consistent reports from witnesses to the effect
that people who acted as though they were in a kind of trance
were killing and eating their victims
prompted authorities to examine the bodies of some of the victims.
Medical authorities in Cumberland have concluded that in all cases
the killers are eating the flesh of the people they murder.
Repeating this latest bulletin just received moments ago from Cumberland, Maryland,
civil defense authorities have told newsmen that murder victims show evidence
of having been partially devoured by their murderers.
Medical examination of victims' bodies shows conclusively
that the killers are eating the flesh of the people they kill.
And so this incredible story becomes more ghastly with each report.
It's difficult to imagine such a thing actually happening,
but these are the reports we have been receiving and passing on to you,
reports which have been verified as completely as is possible in this confused situation.
It is happening, and it would appear
that no one is safe
from this wave of mass...
Hey! Come here!
Calm... Calm down! Calm down!
Hold it! Don't shoot. We're from town.
- A radio!
- ...Butler County, Pennsylvania.
The Butler County sheriff has verified that reports of murder victims
being partially eaten by their slayers is true.
No further details available at this time.
However...
How long you guys been down there?
I could've used some help up here.
That's the cellar. It's the safest place.
You mean you didn't hear the racket we were making up here?
How were we supposed to know what was going on?
- Could've been those things, for all we knew.
- That girl was screaming.
Surely you must know what a girl screaming sounds like.
Those things don't make any noise.
Anybody would know somebody's in need of help.
Look, it's kind of hard to hear what's going on from down there.
We thought we could hear screams, but for all we knew that could have meant those things were in the house after her.
- And you wouldn't come up and help?
- Well, if there were more...
The racket sounded like the place was being ripped apart.
How were we supposed to know what was going on?
Now, wait a minute. You just got finished saying you couldn't hear from down there.
Now you say it sounded like this place was being ripped apart.
It would be nice if you'd get your story straight, man.
All right, now you tell me.
I'm not gonna take that kind of a chance when we've got a safe place.
We luck into a safe place, and you're telling us we've gotta risk our lives just because somebody might need help, huh?
Yeah. Something like that.
- All right, why don't we settle this...
- Look, mister!
We came up, okay? We're here.
I suggest we all go back downstairs before any of those things find out we're in here.
They can't get in here.
- You got the whole place boarded up?
- Yeah, most of it.
All but a few spots upstairs.
They won't be hard to fix.
You're insane. The cellar's the safest place.
I'm telling you, they can't get in here.
And I'm telling you, those things turned over our car.
We were damned lucky to get away at all.
Now you tell me those things can't get through this lousy pile of wood?
His wife and kid's downstairs.
The kid's hurt.
Well, I still think we're better off up here.
We could strengthen everything up,
Mr. Cooper.
With all of us working, we could fix this place up in no time.
We have everything we need up here.
We can take all that stuff downstairs with us.
Man, you're really crazy. You know that?
You got a million windows up here.
All these windows.
You're gonna make them strong enough to keep these things out, huh?
I told you, those things don't have any strength.
I smashed three of them and pushed another one out the door.
Did you hear me when I told you they turned over our car?
- Oh, hell, any good five men can do that.
- That's my point.
Only there's not going to be five, or even 10.
There's gonna be 20, 30, maybe a hundred of those things.
And as soon as they know we're here, this place is gonna be crawling with them.
Well, if there are that many, they'll probably get us wherever we are.
Look, the cellar.
The cellar, there's only one door, right?
Just one door. That's all we have to protect.
Tom and I fixed it so it locks and boards from the inside.
But up here, all these windows, why, we'd never know where they were gonna hit us next.
You got a point, Mr. Cooper.
But down in the cellar, there's no place to run to.
I mean, if they did get in, there'd be no back exit. We'd be done for.
Ah!
We can get out of here if we have to.
And we got windows to see what's going on outside.
But down there, with no windows, if a rescue party did come, we wouldn't even know it.
But the cellar is the strongest place.
The cellar is a death trap.
I don't know, Mr. Cooper.
I think he's right.
You know how many's out there?
I don't know. I figure maybe six or seven.
Look. You two can do whatever you like.
I'm going back down to the cellar and you better decide,
'cause I'm gonna board up that door, and I'm not gonna unlock it again, no matter what happens.
- Now, wait a minute, Mr. Cooper.
- No, I'm not gonna wait!
I've made my decision. Now you make yours.
Now, wait a minute! Let's think about this.
We can make it to the cellar if we have to.
And if we do decide to stay down there, we'll need some things from up here.
So let's at least consider this a while.
...at all costs.
Late reports reaching this newsroom...
If you box yourself in the cellar and those things get in the house, you've had it.
At least up here you have a fighting chance.
Yeah, it looks like about eight or 10 out there now.
That's more than there were.
There are a lot out back too.
So far, the best advice they're...
- Harry?
- It's all right.
- Harry, what's happening?
- It's... It's all right!
Damn thing.
We gotta fix these boards.
You're crazy!
Those things are gonna be at every window and door in this place!
We've got to get down into the cellar.
Go down in your damn cellar! Get out of here!
- I'm... I'm taking the girl with me.
- You leave her here.
Keep your hands off her, and everything else that's up here too.
Because if I stay up here,
I'm fighting for everything up here, and the radio and the food is part of what I'm fighting for.
- If you're going down in the cellar, get.
- The man's insane.
He's insane.
We've got to have food down there.
We've got a right.
- This your house?
- We've got a right.
- You going down there with him?
- W-Well, I...
Yes or no? This is your last chance.
No beating around the bush.
Listen, I got a kid down there.
She can't possib...
I couldn't bring her up here.
She can't possibly take all the racket from those things smashing through the windows.
Well, you're her father.
If you're stupid enough to go die in that trap, that's your business.
However, I am not stupid enough to follow you.
It is tough for the kid that her old man is so stupid.
Now, get the hell down in the cellar.
You can be the boss down there.
I'm boss up here.
You bastards!
You know, I won't open this door again.
I mean it.
- Mr. Cooper, with your help, we can...
- With my help!
Let him go, man.
His mind is made up. Just let him go.
Wait a minute.
Judy? Come on up here, honey.
- You're gonna let them get her too, huh?
- It's all right, honey. Go ahead.
If we stick together, man, we can fix it up real good.
But there... there's lots of places we can run to up here.
Mr. Cooper?
We'd all be a lot better off if all three of us were working together.
Hey.
Hey, kid.
He's wrong, you know.
I'm not boxing myself in down there.
To repeat, this radio station will remain on the air day and night.
Well, we're safe now. It's boarded up tight.
What about Tom and Judy?
They wanna stay up there, let 'em.
There are... two other people upstairs.
- A man and a girl.
- We heard the screaming.
Yeah, but I didn't know who they were, and I wasn't about to take any unnecessary chances.
Of course not, Harry.
- Is she all right?
- I don't know what it is.
She feels warm. Maybe it's shock.
Where'd you get the bandage?
Some laundry in a basket. I tore a sheet.
Let them stay upstairs.
Let them.
Too many ways those monsters can get in up there.
We'll see who's right.
We'll see, when they come begging me to let them in down here.
- That's important, isn't it?
- What?
- To be right. Everybody else to be wrong.
- What do you mean by that?
Does anyone up there know why we're being attacked?
Whatever it is, it isn't just happening here.
It's some kind of mass murder.
It's going on everywhere.
- The radio said to stay inside...
- Radio?
Radio, upstairs. I heard a news bulletin.
There's a radio upstairs, and you boarded us in down here?
- I know what I'm doing.
- What did it say?
Nothing! Nothing!
They don't know anything yet.
The... There's mass murder everywhere, and people are supposed to look for a safe place to hide.
Take the boards off that door.
We are staying down here, Helen.
Harry, that radio is at least some kind of communication.
If the authorities know what's happening, well, they'll send people for us, or they'll tell us what to do.
How are we going to know what's going on if we lock ourselves in this dungeon?
We may not enjoy living together... but dying together isn't going to solve anything.
Those people aren't our enemies.
Mr. Cooper!
Mr. Cooper?
Ben found a television set upstairs.
Let's go up. Tom?
Yes.
If Judy would come downstairs for a few minutes,
Harry and I could come upstairs.
Okay. Yeah. Right away.
- Will you do it?
- Do I have to?
Look, honey, nothing's gonna get done with them down there and us up here.
Do this, for me.
Okay.
Okay, open up.
I'll take good care of her, Helen.
She's all I have.
Why don't you go upstairs now?
Her brother was killed.
Hey, give me a hand with this thing.
I gotta go help Ben with the television.
Don't be afraid of me.
I'm Helen Cooper, Harry's wife.
This place is ridiculous.
Look at this.
There's a million weak spots up here.
Give me one of those.
Her brother was killed.
And they talk about these windows.
I can't see a damned thing.
There could be 15 million of those things out there.
That's how much good these windows are.
Why don't you do something to help somebody?
Here, I have it.
Drag a couple of those chairs together.
There's a socket over here.
Now, you'd better watch this and try to understand what's going on.
I don't want anyone's life on my hands.
Is there anything I can do to help?
I don't want to hear any more from you, mister.
If you stay up here, you take orders from me!
And that includes leaving the girl alone.
- It's on! It's on!
- There's no sound.
Play with the rabbit ears.
Reports, incredible as they seem,
are not the results of mass hysteria.
Mass hysteria.
What do they think, we're imagining all this?
Shut up.
In all parts of the country.
The wave of murder which is sweeping the eastern third of the nation
is being committed by creatures who feast upon the flesh of their victims.
First eyewitness accounts of this grisly development
came from people who were understandably frightened and almost incoherent.
Officials and newsmen at first discounted those eyewitness descriptions
as being beyond belief.
However, the reports persisted.
Medical examinations of some of the victims
bore out the fact that they had been partially devoured.
I think we have some late word just arriving,
and we interrupt to bring this to you.
This is the latest disclosure in a report
from National Civil Defense headquarters in Washington.
It has been established that persons who have recently died
have been returning to life and committing acts of murder.
A widespread investigation of reports from funeral homes,
morgues, and hospitals
has concluded that the unburied dead are coming back to life
and seeking human victims.
It's hard for us here to believe what we're reporting to you,
but it does seem to be a fact.
When this emergency first began,
radio and television was advising people to stay inside,
behind locked doors, for safety.
Well, that situation has now changed.
We're able to report a definite course of action for you.
Civil defense machinery has been organized
to provide rescue stations with food, shelter, medical treatment,
and protection by armed national guardsmen.
Stay tuned to the broadcasting stations in your local area
for this list of rescue stations.
This list will be repeated throughout our news coverage.
Look for the name of the rescue station nearest you
and make your way to that location as soon as possible.
So we have that truck. If we can get some gas, we can get outta here.
- There's a pump out by the shed.
- I know. That's why I pulled in here.
But it's locked.
...emergency meeting called this afternoon by the president.
Since convening, this conference of the presidential cabinet,
the FBI, the joint chiefs of staff, the CIA
has not produced any public information.
Why are space experts being consulted about an earthbound emergency?
So far, all the betting on the answer to that question
centers on the recent explorer satellite shot to Venus.
That satellite, you recall, started back to Earth, but never got here.
That's the space vehicle which orbited Venus
and then was purposely destroyed by NASA
when scientists discovered it was carrying
a mysterious, high-level radiation with it.
Could that radiation be somehow responsible
for the wholesale murders we're now suffering?
Newsman Don Quinn in Washington has posed those questions.
It's obvious.
Our best move is to try to get out of here.
- How are you gonna get over to that pump?
- Look!
You're coming from a meeting regarding the explosion of the Venus probe.
Is that right?
Yes, yes, that was the subject of the meeting.
Do you feel there is a connection between this and the phenomenon...
There's a definite connection.
A definite connection.
In other words, you feel that the radiation on the Venus probe
is enough to cause these mutations?
- There was a very high degree of radiation.
- Well, just a minute.
I'm not sure that that's certain at all.
I don't think that has been...
It's the only logical explanation that we have at this time.
In other words, it is the military's viewpoint that this...
the radiation is not the cause of the mutation.
I can't speak for the entire military at this time, gentlemen.
I must disagree with these gentlemen presently,
until we... until this is irrefutably proved.
Everything is being done that can be done.
We'll have to hurry for our next meeting.
Professor, you feel that there is a definite connection between...
A definite connection as far as Dr. Keller and myself...
Doctor, please. I thought we decided that is not proved yet.
Was it... Was the satellite...
When the satellite was exploded...
It was an unusual amount of radiation,
enough to cause mutation under certain circumstances.
Could have happened to have a bearing on it.
It does seem to have a bearing on it.
- Will there be a reply for the...
- Later.
- Yes.
- There will be a reply?
- Yes.
- Later this afternoon?
There will be a report this afternoon?
- Perhaps there will be a report later.
- Yes. Yes.
Will you close the window?
We are doing everything possible to solve the problem.
We're hoping to get some further explanation of this...
We've heard all we need to know.
We have to try to get out of here.
He said the rescue stations have doctors and medical supplies.
If we could get Karen there, we can get help for her.
...is one of the world's foremost authorities
on space science and technology.
Willard. I saw a sign that said Willard.
It's only about 17 miles from here.
You know this area. Are you from around here?
Judy and I are both from around here.
We were on our way up to the lake to go swimming.
And Judy had a radio, and we heard the first reports about this.
So we knew the old house was here and we came in and found the lady upstairs, dead.
Then these other people came.
We went down into the basement and put a bar across the door, and it is pretty strong.
How could we possibly get away from here?
We've got a sick child, two women, one woman out of her head, three men, and the place is surrounded with these things.
Dr. Grimes, your entire staff, I know,
has been working very hard
to find some solution to these things that are happening.
Do you have any answers at this time?
Yes, we have some answers.
But first let me stress the importance of seeking medical attention
for anyone who's been injured in any way.
We don't know yet what complications might result from such injuries.
How bad has your kid been hurt?
Um...
Look, you go down there and tell... Judy?
Yeah, you tell Judy to come up here, and you stay with the kid, all right?
Destructive action taken with regard to the Venus probe.
In the cold room at the university,
we had a cadaver.
A cadaver from which all four limbs had been amputated.
Sometime early this morning,
it opened its eyes and began to move its trunk.
It was dead, but it opened its eyes and tried to move.
They want you upstairs. Did she ask for me?
She hasn't said anything.
I don't understand.
Baby? It's Mommy.
I hurt.
I'll come back down as soon as I find out what they want.
Thank you, Judy.
The bodies should be disposed of at once,
preferably by cremation.
Well, how long after death, then,
does the body become reactivated?
It's only a matter of minutes.
Minutes? Well, that doesn't give people time to make any arrangements.
No, you're right. It doesn't give them time to make funeral arrangements.
The bodies must be carried to the street and... and burned.
They must be burned immediately.
Soak them with gasoline and burn them.
The bereaved will have to forgo the dubious comforts
that a funeral service will give.
They're just dead flesh, and dangerous.
Judy, I need you to find some bedspreads or sheets to tear up into small strips, okay?
- Is there a fruit cellar here?
- Yes.
We need some bottles or jars to make Molotov cocktails to hold them off while we try to escape.
Hey, there's a big can of kerosene down there.
- I'll see what I can find.
- I'll look for the bottles.
There's a big key ring down there.
There may be a key to the gas pump on it.
I'll check.
We can toss the cocktails from a window upstairs.
Meantime, a couple of us can go out and try to get the gas, then come back for the rest of the people.
But that'll leave a door open someplace.
Yeah, that's right. It better be this door.
It's closer to the truck.
Before we go out, we'll put some supplies behind the cellar door.
While we're gone, the rest of you can hole up in there.
I found some fruit jars in the cellar.
And there's a key on here that's labeled for the gas pump out back.
I'm not really that used to the truck.
I found it abandoned.
I can handle the truck, no sweat.
You're it then. You and I will go.
We'll put whatever lumber we find behind the cellar door.
You can go upstairs and toss the cocktails from a window.
Tom, you and I will have to unboard this door.
After you toss the cocktails, you hustle back down here and lock this door.
It's no good to board it up because we'll have to get back in quickly.
After we get the gas and get back into the house, then we'll worry about getting everybody into the truck.
Now, let's move it.
No place to flee for safety,
except for the rescue stations which have been set up.
Indications are that before this emergency is over,
we will need many, many more such rescue stations.
You always have a smile for me.
How can you smile like that all the time?
How many do you have done?
Come on, honey. We gotta move.
- Tom, are you sure about the phone?
- The phone is dead out.
All you get is a recorded message.
If I could only call the folks.
They're going to be so worried about us.
Everything'll be all right.
As soon as we get to Willard, we'll call them. They might even be there.
I know.
- Tom?
- Hmm.
Are you sure we're doing the right thing, Tom?
- What, about getting outta here?
- Yeah.
Well, the television said that's the right thing to do.
We've got to get to a rescue station.
- I don't know.
- Come on, honey.
You're starting to sound like Mr. Cooper now.
But why do you have to go out there?
Look, I know how to handle that truck.
And I can handle the pump.
Ben doesn't know anything about that stuff.
- But we're safe in here.
- For how long, honey?
We're safe now.
But there's gonna be more and more of those things.
I know. I know all that.
Hey. Listen.
Remember when we had the big flood?
Remember how difficult it was for us to convince you that it was right to leave?
Remember?
Remember we had to go to Willard then?
This isn't a passing thing, honey.
It... It's not like just a wind passing through.
We've got to do something, and fast.
I just don't want you to go out there, that's all.
Hey.
Smile, honey.
Where's that big smile for me?
Boy.
You sure are no use at all, are you?
We've got work to do, honey.
And you... you...
We better get her downstairs.
We have to go downstairs now, Barbra.
She's right. You have to go downstairs now.
Just for a little while, until we get back.
Then we can all leave.
Oh, I'd like to leave. Yes.
- Good luck.
- Yeah.
- You ready upstairs?
- Yeah.
Okay, toss 'em!
Go ahead! Go on!
- I'm going with him.
- Get back in the cellar!
- No!
- It's too late. Too late!
Well, is she coming? Come on.
Get in!
- Come on!
- This key won't work.
Watch it.
Watch the torch!
We've gotta get away from the pump!
Hang on!
Tom! Tom, you guys need to get out of the truck!
Come on. Let's get outta here.
- Come on, come on!
- My jacket's caught.
Let me in! Let me in!
Cooper!
Cooper!
I ought to drag you out there and feed you to those things!
Isn't it three o'clock yet?
There's supposed to be another broadcast at three o'clock.
Ten minutes.
Oh. Only 10 more minutes?
We don't have very long to wait.
We can leave.
Well, we'd better leave soon.
It's 10 minutes to 3:00.
You know anything about this area at all?
I mean, is Willard the nearest town?
I don't know.
We were... just trying to get to a motel before dark.
You said those things turned your car over.
You think we can get it back on its wheels and drive it? Where is it?
Seems like it was pretty far away.
Seems like we ran.
Forget it. It's at least a mile.
Johnny has the keys.
You're going to carry that child a mile?
Through that army of things out there?
I can carry the kid.
What's wrong with her? How'd she get hurt?
- One of those things grabbed her.
- Bit her on the arm.
What's wrong?
Who knows what kind of disease those things carry?
- Is she conscious?
- Barely.
She can't walk. She's too weak.
- Well, one of us could try to get to the car.
- You gonna turn it over by yourself?
You can't start the car. Johnny has the keys.
You have a car? Where? Where is it?
- You won't be able to start it.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.
But where is it?
Good Lord.
...being monitored closely by scientists
at all the radiation detection stations.
At this hour, they report the level of the mysterious radiation
continues to increase steadily.
So long as this situation remains,
government spokesmen warn that dead bodies will continue
to be transformed into the flesh-eating ghouls.
All persons who die during this crisis, from whatever cause,
will come back to life to seek human victims
unless their bodies are first disposed of by cremation.
Our news cameras have just returned
from covering such a search-and-destroy operation against the ghouls,
this one conducted by Sheriff Conan McClelland
in Butler County, Pennsylvania.
So now let's go to that filmed report.
All law enforcement agencies and the military
have been organized to search out and destroy the marauding ghouls.
The survival command center at the Pentagon has disclosed
that a ghoul can be killed by a shot in the head
or a heavy blow to the skull.
Officials are quoted as explaining
that since the brain of a ghoul has been activated by the radiation,
the plan is, kill the brain and you kill the ghoul.
- Want anything from the supply wagon, Kus?
- Uh, no, we're all right.
Okay.
Hey, Cass, put that thing all the way in the fire.
- We don't want it getting up again.
- All right. I gotcha.
Chief McClelland, how is everything going?
Ah, things aren't going too bad.
Men are taking it pretty good.
You want to get on the other side of the road over there.
Chief, do you think we'll be able to defeat these things?
Well, we killed 19 of them today, right in this area.
Those last three we caught trying to claw their way into an abandoned shed.
They must have thought somebody was in there.
There wasn't though.
We heard 'em making all kind of noise.
We came over and beat 'em off, blasted 'em down.
Chief, as soon as you're finished, can I see you here?
Yeah, okay.
Chief, if I were surrounded by six or eight of these things,
would I stand a chance with them?
Well, there's no problem.
If you had a gun, shoot 'em in the head.
That's a sure way to kill 'em.
If you don't, get yourself a club or a torch.
Beat 'em or burn 'em.
They go up pretty easy.
Well, Chief McClelland, how long do you think it will take you
until you get the situation under control?
Well, that's pretty hard to say.
We don't know how many of 'em there are.
We know when we find 'em, we can kill 'em.
- Are they slow-moving, Chief?
- Yeah, they're dead.
They're all messed up.
Well, in time, would you say you oughta be able to wrap this up in 24 hours?
Well, we don't really know.
We know we'll be into it most of the night, probably into the early morning.
We're working our way toward Willard,
and we'll team up with the National Guard over there,
and then we'll be able to give a more definite view.
Thank you very much, Chief McClelland.
This is Bill Cardille, WIC TV 11 news.
Thank you, Bill, for that report.
Official spokesmen declined to speculate just how long it may take
to kill off all the flesh eaters so long as the heavy ra...
- Is the fuse box in the cellar?
- I don't know. I...
I... It isn't the fuse.
The power lines are down.
Helen, I have to get that gun.
Haven't you had enough?
Well, two people are dead already on account of that guy.
Take a look out that window. Look at...
Get over here, man!
Come on!
Go ahead. Go ahead.
You wanna stay up here now?
Helen, get in the cellar.
Get in the cellar now. Move!
No! No!
Karen?
Karen?
Karen.
Poor baby.
Baby.
No! No!
No! No! No!
No!
No! Get out!
No! No, Johnny!
No!
No, no!
Oh, help me, help me.
Oh!
Hey, Vince, Al, you wanna get about four or five men and a couple dogs?
There's a house over here behind those trees.
We wanna go check it out.
You still here, Bill?
Yeah, Chief, we're going to stay with it till we meet up with the National Guard.
- Where'd you get the coffee?
- One of the volunteers.
- You're doing all the work. You take it.
- Thank you.
We should be wrapped up here about three or four more hours.
We'll probably get into Willard then.
I guess you can go over there and meet the National Guard.
Nick, you and the rest of these men wanna come with me?
Bill, I'm gonna check the office, see what's happening.
All right, Steve.
Tell 'em we're going to stay with it and everything appears to be under control.
They need you down there by the barn.
Okay.
Some of you guys can follow the wagon down.
I only need a few men to check out the house.
- Somebody had a cookout here, Vince.
- Yeah, sure looks like it, Con.
He's a dead one. Get up here!
Nick! Tony! Steve!
You wanna get out in that field and build me a bonfire.
You, drag that out of here and throw it on the fire.
- Nothing down here.
- All right.
Go ahead down and give 'em a hand.
Let's go check out the house.
There's something there. I heard a noise.
All right, Vince. Hit him in the head, right between the eyes.
Good shot. Okay, he's dead. Let's go get him.
That's another one for the fire.
All right, send a wagon through directly. Over.
Keep those dogs back off of those things.
Come ahead with the motorcycle, please.
Let's go!
That's the way!
Hey, Randy, light these torches over here.
Get those people in the back.
Way in the back.
My sweet
This is the blessed spot where we first met 17 years ago
Nothing has changed, except for the leopard
The one we saw then...
...has been freed by merciful nature
I always talk of merciful nature, gentle fate, God's compassion...
We judge others...
...reproach them for this and that...
...but what of ourselves?
I haven't done enough for you
We're not badly off, Roman
Thanks to your dowry...
...and the help of your blessed mother
And the assistance of your aunt
I may have furnished the flat...
...but that's about all
No, my dear, I must do more for you
Zina is sixteen, Mila is fourteen
Come now, children... cages are for animals
I think I could increase my income
I'll take on a representative.
I'm thinking of Mr. Strauss
He's a decent, honest man
We'll invite him to a reception with some of our friends
We're a decent, perfect family...
...and I'm worried that I don't do enough for you
THE CREMATOR
From the novel by
Ladislav Fuks
Director
Juraj Herz
You're not to serve alcohol, only tea
Of course, if someone's wiIling to pay...
...you can serve them weak coffee
I haven't had any cake
And smokers wiII have to do without
When you die there is no smoking or drinking for all eternity
Please sit with this charming lady
I stiII haven't had any cake
Mr. Strauss, you call on many confectioners, that's sweet work
But apart from offering your firm's products to these nice people...
...how about offering something else?
Something concerning these nice people personally
As well as your confectionery...
...offer them a pamphlet and application form
JOIN US!
SAVE UP FOR CREMATION
Five crowns commission for every applicant
Excuse me, Mr. Strauss, here is an old friend of mine...
...the engineer Reinke and his wife
We fought together in the Austrian army
I haven't seen you for years.
You must call on us soon
The ladies haven't met, we must introduce them later
Where are you taking me?
We were going to a concert, weren't we?
There's music here
I meant the Philharmonic.
There's only four players here
Maybe the others wiII come later
I'm sure you're fond of music,
Mr. Strauss
Sensitive people love music -
Schubert, Liszt...
How unfortunate are those who die unaware of such beauty
Are you perhaps related to Johann or Richard Strauss?
The composer of "Rosenkavalier"
Unfortunately not, Mr. Kopfrkingl, but I'm fond of Strauss' music
About these applications,
Mr. Strauss...
...some people suffer, you know - so do animals
I have here a wonderful book about Tibet
This is Potala, the palace of the Dalai Lama
Lhasa... it is wonderful, like the Bible
God did well when He said to man...
"...Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return"
Such a crematorium, dear friends...
...is good and pleasing to God
It helps the Lord to speed man's transformation to dust
Some may object on a point of detaiI...
...because Christ was buried, not burned
Dear friends, that was another matter
I always answer that objection with the truth that Christ was embalmed...
...and wrapped in linen
No one wiII embalm you, wrap you in linen...
...and bury you in a cave
You see, my dear friends...
...we live in a good, humanitarian state, which provides crematoria...
...not idly, for people to visit like museums...
...but to give people a chance...
...to turn quietly into dust after the tribulations of life
As this beautiful book on Tibet says...
"We must do away with the eviI of suffering...
"...or alleviate it, at least
"The sooner man returns to dust...
"...the sooner he is set free, transformed...
"...reincarnated"
Animals, too. In the ground it takes 20 years
In the crematorium, 75 minutes
Now, dear friends...
...enjoy yourselves
Lose yourselves in this lovely music, dance, have fun...
...let no one feel left out of things
What a charming man
How he has suffered. He lost his job as a porter, a liver condition...
...or was it his kidneys?
Something to do with urine, anyway
He lost his wife. His son died of scarlet fever
I could increase his commission, under some pretext of success
He's a Jew - a good businessman
Do you think so, dear?
Strauss isn't a Jewish name
Names mean nothing. You call me Lakmé, instead of Maria
And I must call you Roman, instead of Karl
Because I'm a romantic and I love beauty
That's the one
And that noble face, there
I'm framing this for the
Japanese Embassy
Emelian Chamorro,
President of Nicaragua
It's Louis Marin,
Comptroller General
Poincaré's Minister of Pensions
But it says here...
- Never mind that, Mr...
- Holy
Never mind, Mr. Holy, stick a bit of paper over what it says
Here's another thing
The law on cremation of 7th December, 1921
Could you frame it, with a nice border?
I wanted something gayer
New pictures for you, my angel
I bought them out of my first increase in income
Our house wiII be even more beautiful
Is Zina practising?
Such a gifted child
- Where's Mili?
- He's with Jan...
...Dr. Bettelheim's nephew
Good, he's not roaming about
Jan's a good boy - doesn't wander farther than the bridge
- Who is it?
- The President of Nicaragua
We'll put him...
I think, dear, we could hang him over there
- Where shall we hang this?
- The bathroom
You know, my angel...
...I think the bathroom is our most attractive room
Perhaps flowers would look nicer here
Or a hunting scene... the chase...
Little pet
Don't let the poor thing suffer
What about miIk?
Give it to the pet, then.
It's yesterday's miIk, anyway
Statistics show that Prague's married men live longer
We're lucky, Walter.
We must thank the ladies
But for them, we'd die sooner
Yes, Walter, when I remember us soldiers in the World War...
...how we fought and died
When I think what the horses suffered... it's unbelievable
The world should have peace and justice...
...and happiness
Right, but such things have to be fought for
Look at Austria, part of the Reich now. Hitler's a political genius
He freed the nation from poverty...
...unemployment and misery
Haven't you seen our party's pamphlets?
That's Louis Marin, former
Minister of Pensions
I bought it from Mr. Holy.
Mr. Holy is a widower
Right, but our nation suffered a great injustice after the war...
...and anyone with German blood should fight to put things right
JOIN US IN THE S.P.D.
Have some almonds
Perhaps you have your own opinion on past injustices
Such tragedies...
Mr. Strauss was pensioned off...
...then his wife and child died of tuberculosis
Our children go to Czech schools...
...we speak Czech at home, like now
I have only Czech books.
Even my book on Tibet is in Czech
Our blood is Czech
You'll find at least a drop of German blood in your veins
Perhaps... a drop, perhaps...
A sensitive man is aware of that drop, even
I'm meeting Görmann tonight. He's going to Berlin to see the Minister
The Republic is an obstacle in our path, but that's a long story
I wanted to tell you about the girl born with two heads...
...four arms and four legs, poor thing
A life twice blessed
- Where have you been?
- Looking at the car, with Jan
You missed an interesting conversation, Mili
Mr. Reinke is an engineer - he had to study hard
Now he's meeting a Mr. Görmann, and your German is weak
I know we all speak Czech, but you should know some German
Germany's a great nation, after all
Mr. Strauss
You see how the poor man is getting on, Lakmé?
Welcome, Mr. Dvorak. Don't be frightened - I'll initiate you gently
This is our porter, Mr. Vrana
His health is failing - it's his liver
You know, for 15 years I've been entering this temple of death...
...yet I stiII have the same solemn feeling every time
It's a bit like my marriage
I have been married to Lakmé for 17 years...
...and it is stiII as wonderful as when we met at the leopard's cage
Come, Mr. Dvorak, don't be afraid
You have chosen a beautiful, noble profession...
...and a responsible one
Mr. Fenek, a morphine addict
Have you heard? The conference at
Munich is forcing a settlement on us
Everything wiII be all right...
...though I do have a drop of German blood - no one can help his origins
Haven't you overalls, Mr. Dvorak?
Never mind, we'll find you something
Won't you come round with us,
Mrs. Liskova?
You've never seen how we work
My job is to clean the chapel,
Mr. Kopfrkingl
Let's go, then, Mr. Dvorak
May I smoke?
Of course, do smoke if you feel like it
I don't smoke or drink
We can hear the ceremony above, such beautiful music. You like music?
Sensitive people love music
I love it very much
That's only Mrs. Leshetinska practising
The catafalque descends here
Above us is the world of survivors, so to speak
For us, work is only beginning
These furnaces always remind me...
...of the ovens in which our daily bread is baked
This is our timetable
The timetable of death no one can escape...
...unless buried in the ground
Now we burn with gas, not coke
The body is turned to dust in 75 minutes
In fine weather, Mr. Dvorak...
...you can go for a breath of fresh air in the cemetery
You can see inside through these little windows
There's nothing to see now
No doubt you wiII have a chance during some nice cremation
The ashes are placed in these metal urns...
...but the soul is no longer there, it is up in the ether...
...free of suffering, liberated, clean...
...it moves into another body
Here you can see a few coffins for this afternoon
The one to be burned first is already up in the chapel...
...for leave-taking
But not every coffin goes up there
These are not to be opened, they are already nailed down
Leave it, Mr. Dvorak.
It may come in useful
This is Miss Strunna.
Her skin is wonderfully pink
There she is. I looked at her yesterday
She looks so alive, you expect her to get up...
...and walk
You may wonder if she's really dead
That would be a wicked thought
This woman has been declared dead...
...and it is our duty to incinerate her after the ceremony
If Miss Strunna were alive...
...cremation would be terrible, because her life was before her
It would only be good if her life was full of suffering
Suffering is a great eviI, and we must do all we can to alleviate it
But don't worry, Mr. Dvorak -
Miss Strunna is really dead
Such mistakes are rare nowadays
How beautiful
Look, my angels
Pity they are not artificial, to bloom in the snow
Poor Mr. Dvorak is so nervous, he smokes all the time
Come, Mili, don't wander off
What lovely acrobatics
I've something better for you
- What's that?
- Don't be scared
This is the murderer Laget
He committed a murder every day and night
Really live, like at the theatre
It's a waxworks, you idiot
And now, God-fearing people, let us visit the baths
With real water and steam?
It's a waxworks, isn't it?
These are the baths at Franzensbad
People come here to bathe and make themselves beautiful
This woman washes...
...and smiles at the young man
She sits there and the young scoundrel kiIIs her
Old-fashioned baths.
Our bathroom is nicer
She looks like our dairywoman
This isn't a dairy
This man hanged himself because he had the plague...
...a contagious disease...
...he died rather than contaminate others
His body hangs there, as dead as a doornaiI
- He looks alive
- He's hanged
This poor boy was murdered by the notorious Moore...
...with this iron bar
Moore looked innocent, with blue eyes and pink cheeks
He kiIled six people and ended on the scaffold
I knew it!
What do you know? I can't even take you to a waxworks!
The wax dwarf points the way out.
His name is Vitek
He's alive!
For gentlemen with strong nerves we have a special exhibition
Here we have all the contagious diseases. Syphilis, gonorrhoea...
What a scourge.
One can die of that, too
But modern science can protect us
Our good neighbour, Dr. Bettelheim...
Do you stiII consider these tests to be necessary?
You know I touch no woman but my own angel
I'm afraid you'll think
I'm a hypochondriac...
...but I'm afraid of infection from my work
But you don't handle such corpses, so infection is impossible
I'm very glad that Mili is friends with your nephew
Mili likes to roam about, and that's dangerous nowadays
I hear there's martial law in the frontier regions
This wiII end in suffering
Violence never pays, it's an unreliable principle of power
After all, we live in Europe, in the
20th century, in a civilised world
Aggressors are always beaten in the end
Well, Mr. Kopfrkingl, if you think it necessary, come again
These are banana flies...
...used for heredity tests
And this is Drosphilia funebris...
...the funeral fly
Would you like this collection?
I'll sell it cheap for a bit of morphine
Very decorative.
I appreciate such things
I have a butterfly pinned in my bathroom
Where would I get morphine?
I don't even smoke
You know that engineer...
Mr. Reinke is not in Prague.
There's mobilisation
All right, let me have it when he returns. I've got a little left
I've come early today, so as to see you
You've better things to see
How long have you lived like this?
This isn't the life for you
What's the sense in doing such work?
Times are dangerous, there's mobilisation
You should have someone to cling to, someone to protect you
Let's talk it over this evening
I've alarmed Mrs. Liskova
You shouldn't joke in a crematorium,
Mr. Kopfrkingl
Yes, but I only wanted to talk, to invite her to our house...
...to cheer her up a little, poor thing
A present for Zina
Your young lady has a client,
Mr. Kopfrkingl
Perhaps you might like another.
Everyone says you're so respectable
You would have to wait a little for Miss Dagmar
What a pity you only visit us on the first Thursday of the month
Couldn't you call more often?
My income is larger now...
...I have a representative...
...and it's good for the health
Here's Miss Dagmar
You see, it wasn't so long
I've waited a month for you,
Mr. Kopfrkingl
I'll just tidy up
I don't want this to get crushed.
It's for Zina
We have a new employee, a Mr. Dvorak
He works with the coffins
At first he smoked incessantly - now he's less nervous
Thank God he doesn't smoke so much now
Mr. Strauss is quite successful with the application forms
People in the confectionery trade are very pleasant
I want to take on another representative
Someone in toys or cosmetics would be suitable
I must look after my family,
Miss Dagmar
We have a beautiful and blessed home
I must look after you even better
I'll employ another representative.
Mr. Dvorak smokes less now
But I told you that, didn't I?
Lakmé, you look so sad lately.
Is something wrong?
Are you worried?
Zina's birthday is soon
I've bought her a new costume
What about that boy Kaja? WiII he care for his family as well as I do?
This one has died.
Everything dies here
Mrs. Liskova is leaving
She's unhappy here
Leaving us? How sudden.
I'm so sorry
I can't invite you...
...and we'll be so busy...
...with the German army on our frontier
Even Mr. Vrana can't make the torches work
Why get so excited?
Why should they occupy us?
Violence doesn't pay
We live in a civilised world, in Europe, in the 20th century
When is Miss Carska's turn?
She's seventh
The first funeral of the afternoon - it won't wait
Poor Miss Carska
She was about to be married
I must go and see if she is quite in order
I don't want to disturb, but have you got that morphine?
I told you - Mr. Reinke is not in Prague
Be patient. How can you think of morphine...
...when foreign troops are on our frontier?
Conferences are being held, there might be war...
...and Miss Carska was about to be married
How terrible to lose our dear ones
in their prime
O, frost has withered
their cheeks...
... and the black angel of death
has done his deed
An educated speaker
Dvorak's "Largo," Mr. Dvorak
In 75 minutes, Miss Carska wiII be dust to fiII an urn
But not her soul
The soul wiII be liberated - reincarnated, as they say in Tibet
She wiII fly into the ether
You know, premature death can be a great blessing...
...if it frees one from suffering
I think I'd like to go, too
Sometimes I think I'd rather work in the boiler room
Come, Mr. Dvorak, what's the matter?
I thought you were less nervous lately
I told my dear one you smoked less
The boiler room would be demeaning for you
Help yourselves children,
Kaja, young ladies...
Great things are happening now the
Germans have occupied Sudetenland
Beautiful music
Let's see what they say in the papers
BUY VODAK'S
FABULOUS FIREWORKS!
Mili, never put an explosive in your mouth
You could be maimed for life
WiII you take a picture, Kaja?
A photograph is like a conserve of a given moment
They take photos at our crematorium, but not with funny faces
They're bought as souvenirs by those left behind
Has anyone ever woken up in a coffin?
No, Kaja, not even Miss Carska...
...although she was under 30 and about to be married
I read someone came back to life
Then the person wasn't really dead
No one can come back to life after 75 minutes in a furnace
In some humane states, they incinerate animals, too
You, too, wiII be incinerated, bewitching one
In your present incarnation... but one day you won't recognise yourself
Cremation is quite humane...
...and frees people from fear of death
Dear children, there is no reason to fear cremation
Zina, play something for our distinguished guests
Mahler's "Songs for Dead children..."
...or something livelier, like Saint-Saëns' "Danse macabre"
Next Wednesday, Mili and I wiII go to a boxing match
My angel nearly forgot to tell me
I was invited
I've never been to a boxing match.
I think it's a brutal sport
I'm looking forward to it
It's good for you to see a manly sport
- I've always thought it brutal
- Tough, perhaps...
...but we need tough men.
Boxing is man against man
Well, really, it's too bad!
We're always late
Excuse me, these are our seats
That pale woman...
She reminds me...
...of someone I've seen before
- He'll break his leg
- Shut up!
My angel almost forgot to give me the tickets and your invitation
- WiII there be bloodshed?
- Maybe, but there shouldn't be
Clean your glasses, Mili
They'll bash their teeth in
- Dancing?
- No, boxing
They'll hit him
He's the referee
They hit each other, not him
The one in red is a butcher's apprentice
A butcher! There'll be bloodshed!
This is a boxing match, not a slaughterhouse!
You said they wouldn't hit him
It was a mistake.
Shut up and sit down!
There's blood. You said we were going to a boxing match
I can't take her anywhere.
She's crazy, I'll have her put away
Was the apprentice dead, dad?
Nothing is certain in this life, except death
BOXING! JOIN US AT THE
YOUTH SPORTS CLUB!
This Christmas is truly blessed
Angel, you look so radiant
What if I hang you up...
...amongst all these lovely things?
Don't let them suffer. Anezka wiII kiII them in a moment
Why must she do it?
Couldn't you kiII them?
Of course, but I don't like to do it
Anezka is used to it, she's a good old soul
Come children, it's not a thing to watch
Roxana wiII stay here...
...she likes the guts
One carp must be dead, if she kiIled it with one blow
Its soul is in the ether
The second has gone
Their souls are free
You may want to play with their souls...
...but they are not really the souls of carp, just bladders
Their true souls could be reincarnated...
...as cats, perhaps
Perhaps our dear pet was once eaten as a carp
Perhaps we wiII eat her again... as something
But Reinke said he'd call before dinner
Are you eating carp for Christmas?
Yes, my angel is frying them now, on our little furnace
Her blessed mother prepared them in jelly, foreign style
We cook them the Czech way
That's all very well, but what about our blood?
We fight for noble ideals and you fry carp the Czech way
I thought you opposed violence, supported justice and happiness
This republic is a fortress of the enemy
It's a humanitarian state...
...with good laws, like the one on cremation
We'll install a higher moral code, a new order. It was predestined
You are strong and brave
You have a pure, Germanic soul
Karl, this wiII be a test of your strength and courage
On 6th March the Jewish community has some celebration...
...a concert or something - get yourself invited
You know that old Jew, Bettelheim...
...he'll take you along
Keep your ears open, listen to what they say
In a way it's to help those unhappy Jews
How wiII it help them?
They're a misguided, unhappy people.
They understand nothing
They fight against our Führer
They're a misguided nation.
You can help them
Find out what they're saying, what they're thinking
We'll join you in a moment, dear
I've brought a party application form for you
Become a member. There's stiII time
I must go now - to the Casino in Rose Street
We don't usually take our wives there, of course
Today is an exception
Lots of blondes there, usually - see for yourself
Only party members can go to the Casino
Our comrades, fellow Germans
Mother tongue
I swear I am not of Jewish race or religion
Only blondes? No brunettes?
I'll have to get used to it
Now it's really Christmas.
We have candles at home, too
At the crematorium we have them all the time
I wonder what the Bettelheims are doing?
They celebrate Christmas, even though they're Jews
He earns a lot of money, thanks to other people's misfortune
The temple of death is idle on Christmas Day
No cremations, like a Saturday, though I think they should work today
We should liberate as many souls as possible
Christmas should be generous to the dead as well as the living
At least the carp have profited from it
I wiII have a symbolic glass only.
I'm a teetotaller
The Germans don't drink, either
A humane nation, with a law on cremation
They have a great future before them
I hope... we, too, belong to this great chosen nation...
...which wiII install a higher moral code
Blood is blood, and cannot be gainsaid
Do you think it's stiII necessary,
Mr. Kopfrkingl?
Can you tell me how my blood is, doctor?
There's sure to be nothing, as always. Negative
I didn't mean that, I meant what is my blood?
Is my blood Czech or is my blood German?
It's impossible to tell
At least can you tell whether it's Slavonic or Germanic?
There's no difference in blood, it's like human ashes
You yourself say that all human ashes are the same...
...be they French or Spanish, doctor or clerk...
Is it true, doctor...
...that the Jewish community wiII soon have some celebration...
...with lovely songs?
You're thinking of the
Chevra Kadisha Seudah
It is a dinner, held in the Funeral Hall
I fear it wiII not be so nice this year. Would you like to come?
In the Funeral Hall?
What a beautiful tremolo
They said the Führer was a scoundrel?
Such beautiful singing... so mournful...
- Liquidate party members, they said?
- Yes... there was a crowd talking...
That cantor, those high notes...
They said they'd destroy Germany?
Seize power?
Yes, take power in their own hands... and that soft, mournful song...
So they practically said they would destroy the Reich?
Yes, yes...
It was all like some solemn funeral
You were right, the Casino is heavenly
No one is suffering
Soon we'll end all suffering...
...in Warsaw, Paris, London,
New York...
We've already liberated
Bohemia and Moravia
Not even horses wiII suffer, everything wiII be mechanised
Did you see any horses in the occupation of Prague?
The German army is mechanised, like your crematorium
The Führer wiII create a paradise
We must drink to the victory, mustn't we?
I don't drink... or smoke
Today is an exception
I'll never forget the 15th March, 1939
Just a symbolic glass, perhaps
But we have enemies, Karl
In your crematorium, too
We must rely on you, our only party member there
What's the situation there?
Some of them don't understand anything
Like Zajic...
...Fenek... Beran...
...Podzimkova... Pelikan...
...or the porter, Vrana
There's something wrong with his liver...
...but he's an enemy of the Reich
As for Liskova...
...she no longer works there, but we can find her address
And the director...
...the director of my temple of death...
...also hasn't the right attitude
He once said he'd like to incinerate all the Germans
I don't know whether he should remain as director
We'll think about it
And what about your unfortunate Jews?
You even employ two
I don't know... Mr. Strauss...
He's a decent, honest man...
...he likes music, works well - only for the money, perhaps
He told me he doesn't agree with the Germans
Doctor Bettelheim...
...he's a good man, but he doesn't understand, either
I fear his nephew, Jan, is under his influence...
...just a boy
I don't like him.
He takes Mili roaming.
And Anezka...
...their servant, a good soul, isn't Jewish
She kiIled our carp, I couldn't. But she's under Bettelheim's influence
I think the Jews are a misguided nation, beyond re-education
All that incredible music
Look, in Sparta they kiIled weak children
Some might think it cruel, but it was a merciful thing...
...for the children
They would only have been miserable - the nation benefited
Your Maria's mother used to prepare carp in jelly
A foreign style, as you said. Don't you know it's the Jewish style?
Your Lakmé's mother was Jewish
When I reminded your black-haired
Lakmé of your German blood...
...she said Czech was spoken in your house
Your Lakmé didn't tell you of my invitation to the boxing match
She's not pleased you've joined the party
I'd like to know her reaction when your kids go to a German school
She has a bad influence on Mili - he's weak, effeminate
That's how they work, secretly, with families, children
How long have you been married,
Mr. Kopfrkingl?
Our blessed marriage has lasted for 19 years
We first met at the zoo, in front of the leopard's cage
We must make sacrifices,
Mr. Kopfrkingl
In the circumstances, I'm afraid you couldn't occupy higher posts
There is no difference in blood.
Dr. Bettelheim says so
There's a tremendous difference.
Pure blood comes first
There's no place for inferior blood in the new order
Isn't your Dr. Bettelheim a Jew?
Your Lakmé should understand that she's unfit to live with you
It's incompatible with the honour of an honourable, healthy man
She wiII have many problems, Karl
I couldn't come earlier, sir
I had to attend several unanticipated meetings
It's not like you, Mr. Kopfrkingl, but everything seems to be changing
Certainly, some personal changes are only to be expected
You hardly ever smoke nowadays,
Mr. Dvorak
Now Mr. Pelikan can take the beauty to the chapel
You can take her away, Mr. Pelikan.
She is ready
What about that morphine?
I'm an honourable, healthy man. In your own interest, I won't provide it
If you don't stop pestering me,
I'll call the police
Morphine addiction is a vice, incompatible with the honour of man
Not another word, or I'll have you put in an asylum
Haven't you noticed that our Torches of Remembrance have gone out?
Well, they've arrested Beran,
Zajic and the director
What can we do?
Poor Fenek is crazy for morphine.
He's an effeminate, broken man
What about Prachar's drinking, and his unfortunate son, Vojta?
Who else have we left?
It's that boxer, the butcher's apprentice
Do you know him?
I've been to that youth club twice
It said on the pamphlet, "Join us!"
That's a very good idea
You must be tough. You have German blood in your veins, haven't you?
You'll go to a German school
That boxer wiII make a better friend than Jan Bettelheim
Tell me about this boxer.
What does he say?
He says he must train hard, so he can bash the Germans' teeth in
That's what he says, dad
But that's all wrong, Mili
Now you and Zina must go to visit auntie
But when you come back,
I'll explain everything to you
Now we're alone for once...
...why don't you dress up?
Let's have a special dinner
Put on your little black dress - you hardly ever wear it
Then we'll bathe in our lovely bathroom, like at a Roman feast
I'm going to be promoted to the post of director
Isn't it perhaps our blessed wedding anniversary?
Or at least the anniversary of our meeting at the leopard's cage?
Well, let's pretend it is
Aren't you hungry?
One should make the most of every day in life...
...as though it were the last
The whole world is open to us
The sky is open to us...
...our sky which has been unclouded for 19 years
But I've noticed that the bathroom ventilator is broken
I've fixed it with a rope, untiI it's mended properly tomorrow
You can reach the rope by standing on a chair
Can you hear that lovely singing?
How unfortunate are those who die unaware of music's beauty
You at least loved music
Come, dearest, let us run the bath
Won't you be too hot?
Open the ventilator, dear
What if I hanged you, dear?
May I speak to director Kopfrkingl?
Excuse me, I was reading
WiII you have a drink?
Brandy? Czech slivovic?
Thank you, but I don't drink or smoke
The Dalai Lama has died
For years our blessed homeland,
Tibet, has sought the great man...
...in whom Buddha, our saviour, has been reincarnated
Now, at last, we have found him
The throne in Lhasa awaits you
I shall return to fetch you, then we shall leave for the Himalayas...
...our heavenly, blessed homeland
It is my painful duty...
...in my new capacity as director of this temple of death...
...to officiate at my own beloved wife's funeral
Our 19 years of happy marriage have been ended...
...by her tragic death
But it is true that death can sometimes be a blessing
A great blessing...
...when it spares us suffering
It can spare us the anxieties, the terrors...
...which might await us...
...in later life
You wiII return to the place from whence you came
Your soul wiII be free...
...to fly into the ether
The Teutons, my dear friends...
...incinerated their dead...
...purified with flame
I take leave of you, my angel...
...as director of this crematorium and as your loving husband
But we must make sacrifices
There is nothing certain in this life, except death...
...and the fact that a new order wiII be installed in Europe
The Führer's New Europe, and death
Those are the only two certainties we can have
The flames wiII not hurt you, my beloved
We've pensioned off Vrana, the porter
He was too old
And Mrs. Podzimkova, the cleaner, too
It's for the best - she once told me she was afraid of the incinerators
I'll keep the others for the time being. But Mili worries me
He's even more of a weakling, and he goes wandering off
Hedvika, give me the pink soap
His mother was half-Jewish... it must show
Mili is a half-caste
According to Reich civiI law,
Mili is a quarter Jewish
He won't be accepted for higher education or by a youth organisation
He lazes about
Mili dreams of being a soldier, now there's a threat of war
He may run away to join up, as a romantic gesture children are a worry
It's Saturday today - the temple of death is not working
At least you'll be able to look around
It's where your father began work 20 years ago
Where are you going?
Just out
We're going for a walk, it's such a nice day
We are living in great times...
...we must bear all our worries and fears bravely
Your blessed mother... I wonder how she was reincarnated
WiII you have ice cream or a cake?
Both, I think
Buy one only - you'll have no appetite for dinner
Let's go through the cemetery, it's much nicer
I used to walk here in the lunch hour, before I became director
This is a cemetery, not a fun fair!
Don't you know what a cemetery is?
She's crazy. She thinks it's all fun
Take no notice
Was your cake nice? Good
One shouldn't profane a sacred place
That's not for you, Mili
What a pretty memorial
The Greek Torches of Remembrance - they had them in Sparta
They've been burning ever since the new employers came
But they're not burning
This is where people are turned to dust
You're not frightened are you, Mili?
Mr. Dvorak
This is the preparation room
This coffin is nailed down because the corpse won't be exhibited
On Monday it wiII go first to the chapel, then straight to the furnace
It contains the body of a pure-blooded German
A man of pure race, not an effeminate, weak soul
Clean your glasses, you'll ruin your eyesight
Mr. Dvorak wanted to throw this away...
...but I said it might come in useful
There is no difference in ashes
What if... I put you in with him, Mili?
The time has come.
The throne awaits you
Tibet, our blessed homeland, awaits its ruler
The wall that restricted your vision has fallen
The sky is clear...
...the stars are above us... you wiII save the world
You are Buddha
The sky is clear, the stars are above us
Lhasa
I used to read about it in my book on Tibet
Let all creatures be freed from suffering
But I have yet to save one more good soul
One more soul must be saved...
...from the suffering which would await her...
...in our new paradise on earth
Wait tiII next Saturday evening, my son
That's it, Mr. Kopfrkingl
We must test some, you know...
...this is top secret
You have 20 years experience
The gas furnaces of the future.
You could be technical supervisor
But absolute secrecy is necessary
Of course, I quite understand
Equipment to incinerate the greatest number at once
To free as many souls as possible from the fetters of existence
To fly into the universe, dissolve into the ether
I think it's a tremendous opportunity...
...because ordinary crematoria take 75 minutes...
...with one body per furnace
You see, in such enormous, communal furnaces...
...taking one hundred, five hundred, a thousand...
...it could all be done in ten minutes
Big installations, functioning continuously...
...bodies could be fed in one end...
...and ashes would come out the other end, mixed up, of course...
...but no matter, there's no difference in ashes
And liberated souls would fly out of the top
All humanity could be liberated, the entire world
Poor Mr. Prachar... Vojtik...
...what happiness for Bettelheims, for all at the Jewish celebration...
...so many, if I could give them hope of freedom from suffering...
...I'd tell them they'd be reincarnated
Mr. Kopfrkingl... you must be over-tired
You know, it doesn't really matter if someone isn't quite dead
In such big, continuous incinerators no one could come to life again
But absolute secrecy is vital, don't forget
Yes, absolute secrecy is vital
I have been called on to manage a great enterprise
I'll no longer be the director of a small crematorium
Soon I'll be in charge of a huge organisation...
...although the detaiIs haven't been decided yet
- Where are you going?
- Ah, Kaja
I'm taking our dear one to see something
Shall I call next week?
By all means, next week.
Have you got your camera now?
Pity. It's such a nice day, a photo would be a nice souvenir
No one wiII suffer any more -
I'm preparing a huge installation
Let's go through the cemetery, it's nicer
I used to walk here every lunch hour. Perhaps this is the last time
My wife ran away a week ago
You met us here, remember? Have you seen her. A boy was with you
I've been waiting here
She may return. She's mad
You can see where your father began, where he works
It's disgraceful, don't look, dear
That's not for you.
Look at that pretty memorial
This is where people are turned to dust
But it's all too slow - I'll introduce something more efficient
This is the preparation room
This coffin is nailed down because it wiII go straight to the furnace
No, this would be improper
She was a piano tutor, that wiII be more suitable
You see this?
I told Mr. Dvorak it might come in useful
We must go
The restricting wall has fallen
The stars are before us, eternal light
Now you wiII save the world
The nation, all humanity, is waiting for you
I am glad you've come.
I shall leave with you
I shall sit on the throne
But I have a daughter stiII - she is a quarter Jewish
I have not yet saved her
Don't worry, we'll take care of her
There is a lot of work waiting for you, Mr. Kopfrkingl
For the nation, for humanity
No one wiII suffer.
I shall save them all
I shall save them all
The whole world
THE END
CHARLIE (VOICEOVER): I
have been hurt by others, and I will hurt them.
I will make them suffer
 like I have suffered.
NARRATOR: The words
of a sadist, one of the most disruptive
 elements in human society.
To have complete
mastery over another, to make him a helpless
object, to humiliate him, to enslave, to inflict moral
insanity on the innocent, that is his objective,
 his twisted pleasure.

[HORN HONKS]
-Strange looking place.
-What I thought.
Fuel pump.
-How long you think
 it'll take you to fix?
-Has to be replaced.
Take about a half an hour
 if they have the part.
-Hm.
-They should have one with
 all these wrecks around here.
This back highway's good for
time, but have car trouble and you've got problems.
-If it had to happen, I'm
glad it happened where it did and when it did.
I didn't much relish the idea of
 being stuck on those mountains.
-I'd say we're lucky.
Another few miles, we'd
 have been in desert.
-Is it what you
 thought, Mr. Stiles?
-I'm afraid so.
-Can we still make the game?
-Oh, we got 40 miles to go.
Game doesn't start 'til 1:30.
We can still make it
 if they have the part.
-And if they don't?
-It's plain stuck.
-If it wasn't Sunday, they
 could order one from Lancaster.
-Where are the people
 who run this place?
Hello?
-You see, when the
 player swats the ball--
-Not swats the ball, Doris.
Bats.
The player bats the ball.
-Yeah.
When the player bats the ball
 and it goes over the fence--
-That's a home run.
-I know.
But if no one can
make him out, why does he have to run
 around the bases?
-Because he has to.
That's the rules.
He must touch every base.
Would you like a Coke?
-Oh, thank you.
-Somebody can run off
with the whole place and the owner would
 never know it.
-Coke, Ed?
-Sure.
-From the looks
 of things, nothing
'round here worth taking.
-It's a wonder they get
 any business at all.
Everything is so
 dirty and greasy.
-All work isn't white
 collar work, Miss Page.
-I was in the Army.
I had my fill of
 this repairing tanks.
Miss Prim and Proper
 should have known me then.
-Doris Page is a sweet girl,
 Ed, and a good math teacher.
Uh, a little on the
 prudish side, perhaps.
-A boy in my phys ed class
 calls her Miss Ice Buckets.
-Mr. Oliver, I think
 theirs is a, a silly rule.
There is no reason why a man
should have to run around the bases when they
 can't get him out.
-Isn't that a woman for you?
Never seen a baseball
game and already she's changing the rules.
-You should go to a
 ball game with my wife.
-Well, I still think
 that's a silly rule.
-We're never going to
 see any baseball today.
Where's the guy that
 runs this place?
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Hey, what about some service?
-Hello?
They must be around
 here some place.
Doesn't seem likely
they'd go away and leave everything wide open.
-Perhaps they're around
 in back some place.
ED: Hey, anybody here?
Hello?
Hello?
If the pump hadn't already
been stripped off that Chevy, we might be in business.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-We got ourselves a fuel
 pump if it's any good.
-Will that work on our car?
-Take a few adjustments,
 but should get us to LA.
I'll borrow a few wrenches,
 and we'll soon be out of here.
-Our Mr. Stiles
 has many talents.
-A fine young man.
Be a lucky woman that hooks him.
-Oh, Mr. Oliver, I do believe
 you're playing Cupid again.
-You're only young
 once, Miss Page.
-Why, Mr. Oliver, you
 sound like an old man.
-Well, 52 yesterday.
-I'd say you'd had a
 fine and full life.
A nice home, a lovely wife,
 two handsome children.
-Carl Junior graduates from
 West Point in two weeks.
Wife and I are going
 back for the graduation.
-This guy really takes
 care of his tools.
-Hm.
Wonder where these people are.
-I'll look around and see
 if I can find somebody.
-I don't want to
shock you, Miss Page, but I'd rather not
 get my shirt dirty.
-Oh really, Mr. Stiles,
 I'm not that stuffy.
-I don't know.
We've taught the same
school for over a year and it's still Miss
 Page and Mr. Stiles.
I do think Ed and Doris
 would sound a lot better.
-From now on it shall
 be Ed and Doris.
-Just a snake skin.
They shed this time of year.
-I can't stand snakes.
-Most people can't.
Part of the country's
 loaded with them, big ones.
I hear they get to be as
 much as nine feet long.
-Well, I was certainly
 wrong, wasn't I?
-Hello?
Hello?
Anybody here?
Hello?
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Hello?
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[CLANK]
[KNOCKING]
-Doris?
Ed?
Hello?
Hello?
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-You'd never know
he's the same history teacher from old Lancaster High.
He really cuts loose.
Today he'll really be in
 this glory with his red flag.
-I know.
Edna told me last night
that he hasn't seen them play since they left Cincinnati.
She said ever since he got
 the tickets he's been--
-There's something going on
 here that just isn't right.
Settings were four at the
kitchen table, two plates eaten from and two plates
 untouched, pie still warm.
Except for a cat there's
 not a sign of life.
The sooner we get out of here,
 the better off I'll feel.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Just keep working,
mister, because you're going to fix your car
 just like you intended.
-Young man, you have
 no right to take our--
-Shut up.
-What if I don't fix it?
-You'll fix it
 all right, mister.
You better not take
 too long, either.
-Supposing I get it
 fixed, what happens then?
-Me and my girl go away
 and won't bother you.
(SCOLDING) Ah, ah,
 ah, ah, ah, ah.
-How do we know
 you'll keep your word?
-Looks like you're just going to
 have take it, ain'tcha, mister?
[GIGGLES]
-Bang!
[GIGGLES]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-You, give me your wallet.
-There's not much, but
 you're welcome to it.
Well, we're only
 schoolteachers, young man.
-You hear that, Judy?
"We're only schoolteachers."
We don't like
 schoolteachers, do we, Judy?
Teachers think they're so much
 smarter than everybody else.
-You have our money.
Isn't that enough?
What else do you want?
CHARLIE: Just keep
 working, mister.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Teachers used to call
Judy dumb, make fun of her, send her home from
 school crying.
DORIS: (SCREAMING) No!
Stop it!
-You're a pretty good size, boy.
I wonder how tough you'd
 be without that gun.
CHARLIE: Ooh, you're one
of them real big talkers, ain't you, mister?
All right, big talker,
 hand over your wallet.
Come on.
Pick it up.
-You pick it up.
-You're a real big man in
 front of your lady friend.
But I'm going to show her
 just how big you really are.
-Put down that gun and I'll
 show you how big you are.
-I'm giving you three seconds,
 mister, to do what I say.
I'm saying you pick
 up that wallet.
One, two.
-Please, do as he says.
-(GIGGLING) Uh, you
 put on the fender.
Or do you want the gun, huh?
You want the gun?
On the fender.
Big man, huh?
I guess you got showed
 how big you really was.
Start working.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-May I get some water?
This poor man has been
 blinded by his own blood.
Don't you even have the decency
 to let me care for this man?
What kind of a person are you?
Do you enjoy hurting
 others, seeing them in pain?
How can you be so inhuman?
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-(SCOLDING) Eh, uh, uh uh, uh.
[GIGGLES]
[JUDY GIGGLING]
-How is he?
-His head is all right,
 but I know it must hurt.
The gash in his cheek
isn't too, too bad, but the cut over his eye,
 it won't stop bleeding.
I'm afraid he might
 bleed to death.
-Now, now, Doris, it
 can't be that bad.
-Where do you
 think you're going?
-This man needs
help, and he's going to get it if you
 want this car fixed.
He's going to be
 all right, Doris.
You're lucky, Carl.
A little more to the right
 you wouldn't be here.
If we can get you some
water and in the shade we can stop the bleeding.
What about letting this
 man get in the shade?
-How can you be so cruel?
-You get back in that car, and
 he won't be needing nothing.
-Oh, by all means,
 enjoy your lovemaking.
Well, the least
you can do is allow a suffering man a little water.
Carrying on like that when--
 you're no more than an animal!
You get your dirty hands off me.
-You leave her alone if
 you want the car fixed.
-And he won't fix it unless
 you let us get some water.
-There's a pump by the house.
-You keep working
 on that car, mister.
And you, go ahead.
Shoot if they move, Judy.
If I hear a shot, your
 girlfriend is dead.
Don't get no ideas.
Judy don't know
 how to use a gun.
-I wonder, I wonder why
 he changed his mind.
Ed, I don't like this.
-I know something else
 you won't like, Carl.
Remember reading last week
about those brutal killings in Arizona?
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Will you please let me by?
Why are you putting us
 through this torture?
You have our money and
 you're taking our car.
Isn't that enough?
-You keep your
 dirty hands off me.
You think your so
 much better than me.
Your kind all think that way.
You called me inhuman.
-All right.
I apologize.
I shouldn't have said that.
Now, will you let me go?
-Called me an animal.
-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I said those things.
Now, can I go?
-You're sorry, but
 you still think it.
You think I'm dirt.
You think Judy's dirt.
You'll always think it 'til
 you don't think no more.
Your kind means
 nothing, you hear?
Nothing.
Why don't you scream?
Maybe the big talker
 will come and help you.
Maybe Miss Goodie
Good Good still thinks she's so
 much better than me.
How does it feel to be
 touched by dirt, huh?
Goodie Good Good don't like it.
Taste it.
Taste it!
Eat the dirt.
Taste it.
Miss Goodie Good don't think
 she's so much now, does she?
She don't mind being
 touched by dirt.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Get moving.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[GIGGLING]
-What did he do to you, child?
-It's all right, Mr. Oliver.
It's all right.
[JUDY GIGGLING]
-Get back to work.
-You want that car fixed,
 you can do it yourself.
-Starting to be the
 big man again, huh?
-You're the big man, Tibbs.
That's the name, isn't it?
Charlie Tibbs?
The big man who
 killed seven people.
Made them get on their knees
 and shot them in the head.
The paper calls you
 a thrill killer.
Must be a real thrill to
 wipe out a family of five.
How many thrills have you
 had since you left Arizona?
What about the people here?
Did you kill them too?
-How long do you
think you could keep getting away with this, son?
The law's bound to catch up
 with you sooner or later.
-And the law has ways
 of handling murderers.
-Please don't
 antagonize him any more.
-What's going to happen to you?
-Anybody opens
 their mouth again,
I'll blow their brains out.
Listen, big man, you get
back to fixing that car, or you're going to be
 a big dead man fast.
All of a sudden
everybody's becoming the big talker,
 getting kind of brave.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Nobody wants to
 talk no more, Judy.
-(WHISPERING) I'm going
 to get my goodie bag.
-Judy, bring me a soda.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Just a little target practice.
(WHISPERING) I'm going to shake
the bottle over [INAUDIBLE] head.
-Mr. Oliver, they're going
 to do something terrible,
I just know it.
[JUDY GIGGLING]
-You, get up.
Over there.
-What are you going to do?
-Shut up.
Move!
That's far enough.
Down on your knees.
On your knees!
Seeing as how you like to
 talk, go ahead and talk.
Talk all you want.
As soon as I finish this, you
 going to be through talking.
School be out for you, teacher.
You better start
 talking, mister.
Your time's running out.
-You can't shoot me like this
 for no reason, for nothing.
Surely blowing my head off
 can't give you a thrill.
Is it money you need?
I have close to
 $2,300 in the bank.
Tomorrow you can call my wife.
She'll give it to
 you, all of it.
You and your girlfriend can
 have a lot of fun on $2,300.
-He sure is talking
a lot different than he did a while
 ago, ain't he, Judy?
-You have a father, don't you?
Would you want someone
 doing this to him?
Think of your own father
 in my place, or yours.
CHARLIE: Save your
 breath on her, mister.
I'm the only thing
 in the world she has.
Her old man's dead, and
 her old lady's a drunk.
-Young lady, can't you
 realize this is wrong?
You love him, don't you?
You know what it is to be
around someone you love and who loves you?
I have loved ones too, a
daughter a little older than you, a son about his age.
Please, I beg of you,
 talk to your boyfriend.
Tell him this is wrong.
Tell him, please.
My god, child, haven't
 you any feelings at all?
Can't you understand?
-Look at him squirm, Judy.
They're all alike, ain't they?
Yellow when they go.
-You just can't wipe out a man's
 life like this, not like this.
-We just can't stand
 here and watch.
-Ed, you can't let him do this.
Maybe he'll listen to you.
Talk to him.
Ed, talk to him.
--[INAUDIBLE] Make
 somebody do something.
Tell him you won't fix the car.
Don't let him do it.
ED: You want the car fixed?
-Maybe the big man wants
 to take your place.
He says one more word, he will.
What about it, big man.
You feel like talking?
Maybe Miss Good Good
 wants to take his place.
I guess nobody wants to
 take your place, mister.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-School's out, teacher.
-No.
No, please.
Don't.
Ed, Miss Page.
-(SCREAMING) You
 monster, you monster!
-Doris, Doris.
-Go ahead, do it.
-Shut up.
-Shut up yourself.
-Doris, get control of yourself.
-And you, you coward.
-Doris!
-Don't touch me.
-Doris, you're going
 to get us both shot.
-I don't care.
 I don't care.
Why don't you go
 ahead and shoot?
Go on, shoot.
Go on, go on, shoot, shoot.
I don't care.
-In another couple of minutes,
 I'll have the pump out.
-Shut up.
-It won't take very long
 to put it in the other car.
-I said shut up.
-Look, you're going
to need that car now, and I'm the only
 one that can fix it.
-I ain't waiting too long.
Judy, go get me a
 soda, and that pie too.
-Poor Edna.
How will anybody
 be able to tell?
His son's graduation.
-Doris, believe me.
I feel as badly as you.
He's dead.
Nothing can bring him back.
We're alive.
We've got to think
 of ourselves now.
Do you think I wanted to
 stand there and watch him die?
What could I do?
What could anyone have done?
You can't reason with that kid.
He wants blood,
Doris, and nobody's going to talk him out of it.
Don't you understand
 what we're dealing with?
He's a psycho, Doris.
Or should I have
 taken his place?
Would that have made
 you feel better?
What would you be saying to Carl
 if it was me lying over there?
The pump's out.
-All right.
Put it in the other car.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Ed, I'm sorry.
-Forget it.
-I feel so ashamed for
 acting the way I did.
There was nothing we could do.
Why don't we just run?
The highway is only a
 few yards from here.
-He'd cut us down
 before we got five feet.
-I'll die running before
 I get on my knees.
I can still see him
 drinking with us.
[LAUGHING]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Maybe a car will
 come by and stop.
-Sure, Doris.
Maybe a car will pull in.
-Supposing a car does
 pull in, they won't know.
He'll kill them and us too.
The police, maybe the
 police will pass by.
They do patrol this highway.
They will, Ed.
They will.
-Sure they will.
-They'll find a way to
 make them stop then.
-Doris, miracles do happen,
 but you can't count on them.
-I'm sorry.
-Now listen.
I'm going to try to find out
how many more shots he has left or if he has reloaded or not.
-But how will we find out?
-Four shots we know
 of, that leaves four.
He probably shot
 the people here too.
There must have been two.
Remember what Carl told us about
 the settings in the kitchen.
-Yes.
Two plates eaten from
 and two plates untouched.
-Tibbs must have surprised
 them while they were eating.
They were to frightened
to eat while those two were stuffing themselves.
If he shot them, that
 leaves two shots.
He certainly didn't
 walk here from Arizona.
Maybe he shot someone else.
And if he hasn't reloaded--
-Go ahead and talk, mister.
You talk all you want.
You thinking somebody's
 going to save you.
-Why should I fix the car if
 you're going to kill us anyhow?
-You'll fix it because
that lets you live a little longer,
 like back there.
I know that you were stalling.
If you don't want to fix
 the car, you die right now.
-You want this car, Tibbs.
Who are you fooling?
Oh, you can kill us,
 but you'd be stranded.
-That's a road, ain't it?
Where there's a
 road, there's cars.
Somebody will pick us up.
They always have.
-Is that how you got
 here from Arizona?
CHARLIE: A sailor picked us up.
-How far did he take you?
-Better than real
 love, huh, Judy?
-Suppose you shot him too.
-Naw.
I just cut his throat.
-Why haven't you
 still got his car?
-Ran out of gas last night.
You're sure asking a lot
 of questions, mister.
But you go ahead and
 ask all you want.
-How did you get here?
-A farmer picked us up.
His old crate broke down
 up the road a piece.
Too bad.
I was beginning to
 like that old codger.
-Shoot him too?
-He sure prayed when he
 went, Judy, remember?
He reached for the sky and
 talked to the Lordy Lord.
-Then you shot him.
-Yeah.
Right between the eyes.
-What about the two
 people you shot here?
Did they pray too?
-You must think I'm dumb,
 mister, don't know nothing.
You're counting bullets.
Count all you want.
I can count too.
You know I only fired
seven shots, only got one bullet left
 unless I reloaded.
How many bullets do I have left?
Come on, come on.
You the big man.
Come on.
The one bullet's gone.
Come on, maybe the gun's empty.
Come on, mister.
I'm giving you a chance.
Come on, big man.
Come on, mister.
Come get the gun.
What's the matter, you afraid?
You had a chance, mister.
You should have taken it.
You ain't gonna get no more.
See how yellow they are, Judy?
Afraid of an empty gun.
Big man.
Big talker.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Push her [INAUDIBLE]
-Ed, they're getting
 ready to do something.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-You.
-No.
[ENGINE SOUNDS]
-The police. they're coming, Mr. Stiles.
I told you they would.
They will stop.
They will.
They will.
They're coming after him.
They're coming after you.
You hear me?
You, you, you're not
 going to kill anymore!
-Doris.
-Get in back.
Get in back or I'll
 kill you right now.
Do as I say!
Go!
Over there.
Lie down.
Lie down!
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-(WHISPERING) They're stopping.
-Get up.
Get to the car.
Hurry up.
-It must be the police.
-You get in the trunk.
Get in there or I'll
 blow your brains out!
One noise and your
 lady friend dies.
Keep her out of sight.
She makes one noise,
 you slit her throat.
[ENGINES TURN OFF]
[SQUEAKING]
-Hi.
-Hello, son.
Sure a scorcher.
-Sure is.
-Don't recall having seen
 you around here before, son.
-Friend of the family.
-Just talked to Milt's son
 in town about an hour ago.
Funny, being the
talker he is, didn't mention anything about visitors.
-Uh, he just left
 before I got in.
-Lancaster, huh?
CHARLIE: Yeah.
Been working on the car.
Fuel pump trouble.
-Mine went out only last week.
You know, Jim, it cost
 over $30 to get it fixed.
-Boy, what a crook that guy was.
-Look, somebody lost a 45 clip.
-Where is Milt?
-Out back someplace.
-Boy, he can get more parts of a
 car than the factory put in it.
-Yeah, he sure can.
-Help!
Help!
Help!
[GUNSHOT]
-Help!
Help!
Help.
-Get out.
I told you to keep quiet.
Should have done
 what I told you.
Get moving.
-Oh!
[MUSIC PLAYING]
CHARLIE: I told you
 nobody could help you.
-You're going to
have every officer in California looking for you.
-They don't scare me.
Nobody scares me.
I'm going to give you
 a choice, big man.
You die now, or
 you fix that car.
I'll give you 15
 minutes to fix it.
-Why should I fix it?
You'll only kill
 us when I get done.
-I'm giving you 15 more
 minutes of life, mister.
If you don't want it, I'll
 blow your head off right now.
Hers too.
It's 1 o'clock.
You got until 1:15.
You start working.
[CHUCKLES]
[HORN HONKING]
-Who would ever believe
 something like this?
-How could he
 shoot two officers?
There were two of them.
Two of them.
CHARLIE: Judy, give me that gun.
-15 minutes.
What are we going to do?

[HORN HONKS]
[LAUGHTER]
-Move closer.
Get in front of me.
I got an idea.
It may not work, but
 at least it's a chance.
It's obvious he doesn't
 know much about cars.
Now look, when I
 get the pump in,
I'll ask you to get in
 the car and start it.
Leave it in neutral.
I'll race the motor from here.
When I give you the
 first signal-- uh,
I'll scratch my shoulder.
When I do, you shift into drive
 and push down on the brake.
Got that?
-Yes.
-When I give you
 the second signal--
I'll wink-- hold on tight
because I'll be pulling the gas pedal to the floorboard.
I'm going to try to lure
 him in front of the car.
[GIGGLING]
-Oh, Ed.
-It's just a chance.
We might not hit him, but if
we can at least startle him, it may give me the
 few seconds I need.
Let's just pray this
 doesn't kick out on us.
-What if it does?
-Run for it.
-What if he won't let
 me get in the car?
-It's a chance we'll
 just have to take.

SPORTCASTER (ON RADIO): This
is Dick Woods bringing you music from Dodger
Stadium as we do every Sunday preceding
 the ball game.
Talking about baseball,
those red hot Cincinnati Reds are in town, riding a
 nine-game winning streak.
It's going to be Bob
Purkey going for the Reds and Sandy Koufax
 for the Dodgers.
It should be quite
 a pitchers' battle.
There's still plenty of
good seats to be had, so if you're not doing anything,
come out to Dodger Stadium and see exciting
 National League baseball.
It's a beautiful
 day for a ball game.
Time is 1:10, still
 time to come on down.
And now stay tuned
 for Dodger warm-ups.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-If we could just get them away
 from the car long enough to--
-Music.
All those people laughing
 and yelling, so happy.
Oh Ed, I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
-(WHISPERING) You're
 not going to die, Doris.
[GIGGLING]
-Four minutes.
-Doris, get in the
car and start it so I can see if the
 pump holds pressure.
Doris, get the car and start it.
-Just a minute.
-You want the car to run.
I want to live those
 extra few minutes.
Now I have to check
 the pump for pressure.
-All right.
But it better run good.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Start it up.
-You ain't got much more time.
Two minutes.
How does it feel when
 you're about to die?

CHARLIE: You did something.
-I did nothing.
-It was running pretty
 good a few seconds ago.
You must have did something.
-Look, this pump has
been in a wrecked car for who knows how long.
Now sometimes they get clogged
 and don't hold a pressure.
I should take it
 out and clean it.
-You ain't got time for that.
-It's not holding pressure.
It needs to be cleaned.
-You're out of time, ain'tcha?
-It won't take very long.
-You ain't taking nothing out!
You think you're
 fooling me, don't you?
Think I don't know nothing
 about cars, don't you?
That thing right there,
 that's a carburetor.
The car can't run unless
 there's gas in it.
All you gotta do is prime it.
Now, I seen that
 done, so you prime it.
Well, go on.
There's a gas pump over there.
-Doris, get in the car and
 start it when I tell you to.
-Nobody gets in that car but me.
-Well, if I'm going
prime it, somebody has to pump the gas pedal.
-Just never you mind.
You just put that gas
 in that carburetor.

I suppose he's been drinking again.
He's coming here.
What did you say?
I said, I think we need some petrol.
As I was saying,
I think we need some petrol.
Sorry, it was my fault, darling.
These roads twist so it's impossible to follow them.
It's not your fault. I should have dipped the tanker way back.
Bone dry.
I'll have to see if I can get some help, I'm afraid.
- Someone to tow us.
- Shall I come with you?
- No, it'll be quicker if I go alone.
- All right.
Now, you stay in the car.
You'll be quite safe.
Gerald!
- Try not to be long.
- I'll try.
Stop running.
Go back to your car!
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.
Go back to your car! Go!
Gerald, I was so frightened!
Oh, don't leave it there.
- Someone may want to come in.
- They won't, sir.
- Won't they?
- No one ever comes here now, sir.
Why not?
Why not?
Goodnight, sir.
- Well, what do you think, Gerald?
- Well... I...
We'd better get under shelter!
Why can't you leave us alone?
We wondered if you might have a room.
- A room? You want a room?
- Yes. For the night.
- You're strangers then?
- Well, yes.
Please come in.
Come in, please. Come in.
Oh, you're wet!
Come in and dry yourselves, please.
Anna! We have people...
Guests! Come quickly!
Excuse me. What a night!
- You've left your horses outside?
- We came by motorcar.
Motorcar?
You must be very rich, young man.
It's my father's car.
We borrowed it for our... journey.
Oh, so...
Anna, look! We have guests!
Would you show these good people a room while I get their luggage?
I'll get your luggage.
Oh please, you'll get soaked.
Wait until the rain stops.
I have an umbrella.
Will you sign here, please?
What room do you want?
- I beg your pardon?
- Which room? They are all vacant.
All except one...
Nothing too expensive.
We still have a long way to travel.
- Five marks?
- Yes, that'll be fine.
It is the best we have.
This way...
I will bring you fresh linen and hot water.
Is there anything else you require?
- Some tea, perhaps?
- Certainly.
My husband will lay a fire for you.
Just as soon as he returns with your luggage.
Well...
Anna... Anna, look!
- Well?
- Well, don't you see? This is rice!
I found it among their luggage.
Don't you see what this means?
They're just married.
This is their honeymoon.
We must do everything we can to make them comfortable.
I am fetching them hot water now.
What more can I do?
Oh Anna... Anna, try to forget.
Please. Just for tonight.
For their sakes. Please.
- Tea, darling!
- Shan't be a moment.
It looks good.
- Now, wait.
- Hello, we've got company.
- What is it?
- Someone's just delivered a letter.
Somebody pretty important too, by the look of the carriage.
- Oh... come here.
- What's wrong?
- It's your ear.
- Stop it, darling.
- The tea will get cold, darling.
- I know.
Come in!
- A letter for you, sir.
- For me? But that's impossible.
No, it's addressed to you, the English gentleman, the Grand Hotel.
- That's us.
- Who can it be from?
- Ravna.
- Yes, that's the Herr Dr Ravna.
Very fine gentleman. He has lived at the chateaux now for some years.
Is that the one we saw on the mountain?
Yes, madam.
- He wants us to have dinner with him.
- What?
Well, that's what it says.
"I should like to offer you my sympathy
"and extend an invitation to dine with me tonight.
"You'll find the food at thehotel..."
I'll skip that bit...
My wife is a good woman, but a cook?
"My carriage will call at 8:00 which I trust will be convenient."
Well, what do you say?
- I... I haven't anything to wear.
- He's forestalled you there...
"Come just as you are.
We shall not be formal."
- I think we should go.
- Oh, you should go, madam.
The Herr Doctor is a very charming gentleman and his table is one of the best in the country.
- It'll be an experience for you, madam.
- Very well.
Good evening.
Dr Ravna is expecting us.
- More surprises.
- Pleasant ones, I hope.
You expected the inside of my house to be as unattractive as the outside.
- Is that it?
- Well...
If it were, I could not live here.
I like only to be surrounded by beautiful things, and as I am fortunate enough to have the means to satisfy my wish but there I go, please excuse my appalling manners.
We have so little company here that
I sometimes forget how to behave.
My name is Ravna.
Gerald Harcourt, and my wife Marianne.
Welcome to my house.
- It was very kind of you to invite us.
- It was indeed.
I still can't quite understand how you found out about us so quickly.
To tell the truth, I was spying on your motorcar.
Such things are a rarity in these parts.
When I heard the sound, I used my telescope to watch you drive by.
- We didn't. We broke down.
- That is true.
Before I could do anything to assist you, you had taken the initiative yourself,
Mr Harcourt.
Now, please come and meet the rest of my family.
Oh, that was beautiful!
Thank you, madam.
And now, may I introduce my children to you.
- My daughter, Sabena...
- How do you do?
- Carl, my son.
- How do you do?
- Mr and Mrs Harcourt.
- How do you do?
- Will you play some more for us?
- Later, I think, Carl. After dinner.
Why have you not been to see us, my sweet? Why have you waited so long?
You must know how much we have missed you.
You should not be lying here all alone.
A few years ago I conducted a series of scientific experiments, one of which went wrong.
I was to blame, of course. I'd made a mistake. Scientists sometimes do.
Anyway, that is why I can never return to the city of my birth, why I live here, locked in this ornate coffin.
Oh, but it's beautiful here.
It often happens in life that the most beautiful things are made from the most unpromising of materials.
That wine we enjoyed at dinner.
- You did enjoy it, I hope?
- It was delicious!
Made from grapes trampled by the feet of a peasant.
Dirty feet, as like as not.
- Father!
- Well, it's true, isn't it?
That pheasant we ate, it had been hanging for five...
Father, please!
Perhaps Mrs Harcourt would like to hear you play?
Oh, please!
Something of your own, perhaps, Carl?
Certainly, Father.
Something you've composed yourself?
How exciting!
Thank you.
You have a singularly lovely wife, Mr Harcourt.
Thank you.
- Marianne, are you feeling all right?
- Please don't stop.
Father?
No more now.
I'm sorry.
I thought...
Marianne... I thought you were going to faint.
Perhaps it's too warm in here.
Oh no, it's not that. It's just that she's had rather a long day.
- I think, if you'll excuse us...
- Of course.
- Sabena, will you ring for the carriage?
- Yes, Father.
You will play for me again, won't you?
- It will be my pleasure, madam.
- Goodnight, Carl.
What are you going to do about your motorcar, Mr Harcourt?
Well, we need petrol.
We'd planned to get to Kronenberg tonight.
I know they keep a supply there.
That's 30 miles away, and across the mountains too.
You were off your track.
My wife is not a very good map reader, I'm afraid.
If you don't mind staying at the hotel another day or so,
I'll gladly send over for your petrol for you.
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Not at all.
I'd invite you to stay here, only I'm expecting a number of guests.
The hotel will be fine.
The food isn't that bad.
It was a wonderful evening.
I shall never forget it.
- Why did you let her go?
- They can't escape.
Their motor has broken down.
No petrol.
That's right. They can't leave until I say so.
Who's that?
It must be your other guests.
Oh, yes.
Well, wasn't I right?
You're glad you went?
- Very, thank you.
- And the food was good, yes?
You were quite right.
It was absolutely excellent.
Yes. Herr Dr Ravna, charming, no?
Landlord! Brandy!
- Goodnight, sir.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Mrs Harcourt.
- Goodnight.
Brandy! Landlord!
Brandy?
- ...two... three...
- Another terrible day.
...four. Is it? Five...
Will you ever forgive me for losing the way?
I might, I'll see. Now...
Thank you.
Please.
Well...
I'm sorry but the door was open.
Anna and I wondered whether you'd care to have breakfast with us?
We'd open the dining room, of course, but it's a bit damp.
- We'd rather eat with you, wouldn't we?
- Much rather.
- In five or ten minutes then.
- In ten minutes we'll be there.
Or 15...
Anna, you've laid an extra place again.
Oh, my dear, I've told you so many times.
Oh, good morning again, come in. Please, come in.
Is our fellow guest joining us for breakfast?
Oh no, he never eats.
- How does he live then?
- On brandy and sour cream.
Yes, I agree but...
This weather won't do your business much good.
Business is never any good.
Surely, the magnificent views you must get from here in good weather...
The road is not much used by travellers.
I expect your bar is well patronised in the evenings, though, by the local people, the farmers.
- It used to be.
- Nobody comes here now.
Oh? Why is that?
- Er, some bread, madam?
- Thank you.
You frightened the life out of me.
Here, look at this...
Tania, aged 14.
She's awfully like Anna, isn't she?
Why does she hide it away?
Why does she lay a place for someone who never eats?
That'll be our fellow lodger.
I think I'll have a word with him.
- Good morning! Herr Zimmer isn't it?
- Professor Zimmer.
My name's Harcourt.
We're fellow guests.
- When are you leaving?
- In a day or two when we...
Good!
Why do you want us out of the way?
Look, what's all the mystery?
- What mystery?
- This hotel.
Why does no one ever come here?
- Excuse me, I have work to do.
- Please. I'm only asking for information.
I advise you to ask no questions of anyone in this region.
Well, that puts me in my place.
Carl, how nice to see you.
Is your sister with you?
Yes, she's in the coach but we can't stay.
You must! I know Marianne will be delighted to see you. I'll call her.
We can't stay long. Look, the weather's changing.
Marianne, come and look who's here.
Come in, come in.
- Let me offer you some refreshments.
- Sabena, this is a lovely surprise!
I'll call the landlord, I don't suppose he has any champagne.
No, please, we haven't time.
I bring news of the petrol for your motorcar.
My father has confirmed that there is a supply in Kronenberg.
- Excellent!
- It will take a little time.
We had to send an oxcart for it.
They are not so fast as motorcars.
But more reliable.
It will not be here till Sunday, I'm afraid.
In the meantime, my father asks if you'll do him the honour of attending a party he is giving on Saturday night.
- Please say you'll come.
- There'll be music.
- And dancing.
- It'll be a good party.
- Please say yes.
- Won't it be very formal?
I know what she's going to say:
"I haven't got a thing to wear."
And it applies to me too.
If you'll not consider it impertinent of me to offer,
I have a dress suit I could lend you, Gerald.
And I have the most heavenly dress.
It's red chiffon and lace.
And I'll send you my red velvet cloak to match.
It would look wonderful on you,
Marianne. Please, say yes.
- Then, yes.
- I'm so glad.
- But I'm coming too.
- Tell us some more about the party.
A chef is coming from Paris to prepare the buffet.
How wonderful!
And an orchestra is coming from Vienna.
Good morning. The weather seems to be improving.
It's getting a little brighter, I think.
Please excuse us.
Drive on! Drive like the devil.
- How is it, Bruno?
- Perfect, sir. But one little touch.
- Thank you, Bruno.
- Who's that handsome man?
Darling!
Is that all?
I'm speechless.
- You look terrific!
- Thank you.
Madam, may I add my congratulations.
You look enchanting!
Thank you, Bruno.
- It fits perfectly.
- That's thanks to Anna.
She's worked wonders.
Thank you, Anna dear.
Anna! You're crying.
Oh, my child.
Would you care for a drink, sir?
In the bar.
Good idea, Bruno.
Anna, did you once have a daughter of your own?
Why do you say that?
It isn't true. Why do you say it?
I'm sorry, I only...
That will be the carriage, madam.
You look marvellous, darling.
Madam!
- I beg of you, be careful.
- What are you talking about?
In God's name, be careful.
- What do you think he meant, Gerald?
- Don't worry, darling, he's been drinking.
Marianne, let me look at you.
It fits perfectly, and looks enchanting.
- Welcome to you both.
- Carl!
I've sent for your masks, though in your case, Marianne, it would be a desecration.
But in mine, an improvement.
Is that what you mean?
You know I did not mean that.
Will you permit me?
I think it is an improvement.
Would you care for some Champagne or would you like to dance?
- I'd love to dance.
- Champagne for me.
In that case, may I?
- Carl, I really must have a rest.
- More champagne?
I couldn't. I feel quite dizzy as it is.
I wonder where Gerald is.
You're hungry, I expect.
Let me get you some supper.
- I really must find Gerald.
- I'll find him for you.
Would you see that Mrs
Harcourt gets some supper.
I won't be a moment.
Gerald!
Gerald, where are we going?
Gerald, is this a joke? What is it?
I don't believe you are Gerald.
Carl!
One for Marianne.
- Where is she, by the way?
- I don't know.
Maybe she's in the bar with that brother of yours.
Come on.
Where do you think she could be?
Perhaps she's gone to powder her nose.
You women! Gone to powder her nose.
Why not have another glass of Champagne?
An extraordinary good idea.
Please fetch a special glass of champagne for my friend.
A special glass, that sounds good.
What about a special glass for you?
Later.
To us all!
Delicious!
Perhaps Marianne went outside.
I don't feel very well.
Perhaps you've had a little too much to drink.
A little? Feels like a lot.
Come upstairs and have a rest.
You'll feel better after.
Look here, you're not trying to lead me astray, are you?
I'm a respectable married man.
Is that you're room? Very pretty.
After you.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce a new disciple.
What's happened to the party?
Marianne!
Carl! Thank goodness!
What do you want?
What do you mean, what do I want?
I want Marianne.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Look, if this is a joke,
I'm terribly sorry...
This is no joke. You come here, get drunk, have to sleep it off, and now you say you want someone called Marianne.
Well, I do want her. She's my...
What do you mean, someone called
Marianne? You know who she is.
I do not know.
What?
You came here alone.
And you can leave that way.
- I came here alone?
- Precisely.
And we're beginning to regret that we ever invited you.
- Hans, show this gentleman out.
- Yes, sir.
You saw me come here with my wife, didn't you?
The lady with the red dress and the red cloak.
You opened the door for us!
You came alone, sir.
But...
Carl?
- What's all this about?
- Hans...
You keep away from here or we'll set the dogs on you.
Marianne?
Bruno!
Bruno!
Bruno!
My wife, has she come back?
What wife, sir?
My wife, you old fool!
You know what I'm talking about!
I don't, sir.
Who do you think all these clothes belong to then?
What have you done with them?
What have you done with her things?
Good God!
I understand you wish me to issue a warrant, sir.
- Is that correct?
- Yes.
Against Herr Dr Ravna and his family, of the Chateau Ravna.
Yes.
The most important residence in the district.
No doubt.
Do you realise, sir, that Herr Dr Ravna is the most respected of gentlemen?
- What has that got to do with it?
- It has a great deal to do with it, sir.
You arrive here. A stranger.
A foreigner, in fact.
You are here for less than a week when you start accusing one of our leading citizens of abducting the lady you say is your wife.
She is my wife.
The landlord says you came here alone, sir. I have it here.
What does his wife say?
She is a strange woman, sir.
She refuses to say anything.
I think she's a little...
Look, I didn't come here alone.
I came here with Mrs Harcourt, my wife.
Can you prove that, sir?
For instance, where are her personal belongings, her clothes?
- They've disappeared.
- Disappeared, sir?
Yes, disappeared. Stolen, if you like.
So you wish me to make out a warrant against the thieves.
No, I don't. I only want...
The register!
There's nothing there, sir.
Professor Zimmer, please help me.
My wife, she's disappeared!
I know, she's being kept in the chateau.
Thank God.
Thank God you know where she is.
- Are you a religious man?
- Not very.
- Do you believe in God?
- Yes.
And the devil?
Not the horn-headed, long-tailed devil in the picture books.
I mean the real devil. The force of fundamental evil. He exists, you know.
I suppose he does.
I'd never really thought about it.
The corruption of human beings by the devil can take many forms.
Some of them so foul as to be beyond human belief.
But because they are beyond belief doesn't mean they don't exist.
- Do you know what a vampire is?
- Yes.
- I've heard of vampire bats.
- Not bats. Vampires. Human vampires.
Beings who exist on the blood of other humans.
When the devil attacks a man or woman, with this foul disease of the vampire, the unfortunate human being can do one of two things.
Either he can seek God through the church, and pray for absolution.
Or he can persuade himself that his filthy perversion is some kind of new and wonderful experience to be shared by the favoured few.
Then he tries to persuade others to join his new cult.
I had a daughter.
She was all I had in the world.
I idolised her.
When she was very young, she ran away from home.
Ran away to the city.
She drifted in with a so-called smart set, and finally she was living with a certain man.
She came home eventually.
What was left of her came home.
She was riddled with disease.
And she was a vampire.
They even tried to follow her beyond the grave.
Thank God I was in time.
Her soul now rests in peace.
The name of the man who corrupted my daughter was Ravna.
My God!
And Marianne is with him!
I must go there!
- No, not now!
- Yes, now! Now!
- No, come here.
- Look, look!
The sun!
The one thing a vampire can't tolerate.
Now, your wife is safe until nightfall.
And then, I shall do what I have to do.
You, my friend, will remain here.
- What did you...?
- I'll give you a drug.
It'll make you sleep.
Help to bring back your strength.
You'll need it before the night is out.
Zimmer!
Tania, please, listen to me.
I need help and I think you can help me.
Your name is Tania, isn't it?
And your father is
Herr Bruno, isn't he?
Tania, my wife is here somewhere.
They've taken her too.
Do you know where she is?
Yes.
Will you take me to her, Tania?
I realise this may be dangerous for you, but I promise I will give up my own life than let any further harm come to you.
Please, Tania.
Please take me to her.
I understood my son told you not to come here again, Mr Harcourt.
- Where is she?
- Your charming wife?
She is here, quite safe and happy.
What are you going to do about it, Mr Harcourt?
You must not expect your
Queensbury rules here, Mr Harcourt.
Now, about your wife...
Please let me say it for you.
"If you have so much as harmed one hair of her head..." Is that how it goes?
Now, about your lovely young wife, Mr Harcourt.
I expect that you would like to see her.
Sabena, would you be so kind as to awaken her and bring her here?
I will not say that she has not changed in any way, Mr Harcourt.
She has, as you might put it, grown up.
Tasted the more sophisticated, more exotic fruits of life.
Oh my God!
God is hardly involved, Mr Harcourt.
Furthermore, having glimpsed these new horizons,
I very much doubt if she will express any desire to return with you to England.
Marianne!
Marianne, your husband is here.
Don't you want to see him?
No, I only want to see you.
You've hypnotised her!
She's in a trance!
Marianne! Take your eyes away from him! Look at me, Marianne!
For God's sake, look at me!
- Do you love him, Marianne?
- No, I love you.
- Don't you want him any more?
- No, I want only you.
Prove to me that you do not love him.
Well done, my dear.
Sit there.
Tania...
I want you to... initiate
Mr Harcourt into our society.
Do you understand what I mean?
Go on, Tania.
Wipe it off!
We've got to get rid of the big servant.
The others can't do anything without him.
Bruno!
Bruno, come in here!
Did you hear what I said?
Come on! What are you frightened of?
You know the priest, Father Xavier?
- Well?
- Yes.
Take him this!
N OW?
Now.
- Well? What are you waiting for?
- I can't.
What are you frightened of?
- I can't tell you.
- Then I'll tell you.
- It's Ravna, isn't it?
- No!
You're afraid of what he may do to your daughter.
You know, she's up there in the chateau with him, don't you?
They told me last night.
Do you want the same thing to happen to her?
No. No!
- Then take that message.
- Why don't I go?
- No.
- It'll be quicker.
The moon will soon be rising.
Tonight is going to be a full moon.
Come on, we've got work to do.
I've been planning this night ever since I traced Ravna to the chateau.
From these medieval old books
I've pieced together the details have a ceremony - to be performed when the moon is full, and Capricorn in conjunction with Saturn, as it is tonight.
What ceremony?
A ceremony known as
Corpus Diabolo Levitum: the evocation of the forces of evil.
It is a way of forcing evil to destroy itself.
Now Ravna and all his acolytes are trapped in the chateau.
Tonight I shall destroy them all.
- Won't they have got away by now?
- No, not now.
I've sealed all the entrances to the chateau with a distillation of garlic.
No vampire will pass that.
Well? What does he say?
What does the master say we should do?
- You are to remain calm.
- Remain calm?
- How can we remain calm?
- We demand to see him!
No you don't! You're not leaving till you promise to bring him here to us.
Where is he?
Well...
- We want to know the truth.
- Why are we trapped here?
- What's this force preventing us...?
- Are we in danger?
Yes, you are.
They are trying to destroy us.
What are we going to do?
You must save us!
You must trust me.
Tell us what you're going to do!
They came here tonight to take the girl away because they did not want to risk her life while they were trying to destroy us.
She was our protection then.
She must come back and protect us again.
I start by drawing a simple circle inside which I shall inscribe the great
Pentagram of Solomon, like this.
I leave a space there so that I can enter later.
And now...
That will protect us during the ceremony.
The sword, the ring, the liquid and the horn.
The ring, the sword, the liquid and the horn.
Over...
First incantation...
"I pray thee, without hurt done to my person or my companion.
"In the name of thine master and mine
"by the four words were the great god Alpha said from his own mouth,
"by the nine heavens in which thou dwellest,
"by the strength of the Sun and the Moon,
"and by the power of fire and water."
She's gone!
Quick, come with me!
The girl is coming.
Corpus Diabolo Levitum...
Corpus Diabolo Levitum...
Corpus Diabolo Levitum...
I conjure thee, in the name of the great god Alpha.
In the name of the mighty Beelzebub.
Appear!
It worked!
Look. Look!
Gerald!
Come on, Louis. Come on.
They should make heroin look like something else.
Candy bars, maybe.
You're gonna have to hurry, Louis.
I'm gonna miss my plane.
Be careful, Lisa.
You too, Louis.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Air Canada...
...flight 760 dC-9 jetliner service...
...for New York's Kennedy
International Airport.
Hey, is this St. Luke's Place?
-You, number 98.
-Who, me?
-Where's St. Luke's Place?
-I don't know nothing. I'm a dropout.
I asked you a question, kid.
-Yeah, this is it.
-Thanks.
Big man on campus.
What did she say?
I told you, she just left a message.
-But she asked for me?
-That's right.
-Happy days are here again, huh?
-Well, we'll see.
-You sure this is right?
-Read it yourself.
Don't make waves.
I only asked a question.
Lisa?
-Lisa?
-What are you calling for?
She says she's not here.
-Lisa doesn't live here.
-Yeah, I know. It's clean.
What's the matter?
Since when can Lisa type?
Since never. Come on.
You think the place is bugged?
-You want something?
-You, Mr. Talman.
And you too, Sgt. Carlino.
I want you too.
In fact, I want both of you, and I've come here to buy you.
Sgt. Carlino, if you'd just shut that door, please.
Don't call me "sergeant."
Why? Are you a touchy man?
-Just don't call me "sergeant."
-No matter. Sit. Sit.
We'll have a little chat.
-We'll start with, who are you?
-I'm Harry Roat Jr. From Scarsdale.
Scarsdale?
Well, now, may we have weapons on the table?
We'll have explanations first.
Well, this goes back a little.
-So go back a little.
-Alrighty.
Once upon a time...
...there was a fairy princess named Lisa.
And she had two very good friends, who shall remain nameless.
Now, these three were fond of performing little dramas for select audiences.
Their most memorable performances were that of outraged husband...
...and detective breaking in upon guilty wife in the arms of her lover...
...or vice versa.
They were adaptable.
The detective, it's worth mentioning, was particularly convincing in his performance...
...but then he had had the benefit of previous on-the-job training.
-Man, you're a charmer.
-Thank you.
Things went trippingly for our three heroes...
...until one day, a certain stockbroker, a Charles F. Parker, wasn't it? Got nasty.
And then our poor heroes went to jail, or two of them did.
Lisa, well...
Well, she...
She escaped.
What's the point?
Lisa would like to do something for her two friends...
...now that they're back in circulation again.
-What does she want?
-A doll...
...for which she will pay handsomely.
Now may we have weapons on the table?
-I'm clean.
-Scout's honor?
Lisa says you favor brass, sergeant.
That pocket looks a little lumpy.
I cannot negotiate in an atmosphere of mistrust.
Why, you?
-And, you, what's your favorite toy?
-Geraldine.
What does she do?
-May we have Geraldine on the table too?
-No, we may not.
-Why the hell not?
-Because she's the referee.
Now, Lisa will pay you $2000 each for a couple hours work.
Interested?
What kind of work?
Finding Lisa's doll.
-Are you serious?
-I am.
-What kind of doll?
-An ordinary doll, a child's doll.
What's in it?
-Do we hurt anybody?
-Not a fly.
-Do you care?
-No.
-What do you think?
-What's to think? He's a creep.
Yeah, baby. Not like us, huh?
We want an advance.
250. Each.
Lisa and I thought more like 500 each.
Why so generous?
So you don't ask what's in the doll.
So now we know what's in the doll.
Well, win one, lose one.
It's all straight.
What do we do?
What you always do, Mr. Talman, lie and cheat and play-act.
-Go on.
-Lisa gave the doll to a man named Hendrix.
She met him on the plane from Montreal.
Lisa's friendly.
Why?
Somebody waiting for her, she hadn't expected...
...so Hendrix brought it home here.
Hendrix? Who's he?
He's... nobody.
Mr. Clean. A photographer.
Looks like he has a wife. Where's she?
Out.
She goes to school.
Come on. This is a hell of a place to be talking.
Don't panic, sergeant.
-Why not?
-Because it's arranged. It's all arranged.
By you?
Photographer Hendrix is in his studio waiting to photograph a certain Miss Lejiana.
But a little while ago, her male secretary phoned...
...very efficient, very humble, grovelingly polite...
...to say that she had been delayed.
-He's terrific.
-Last night, Lisa called up about the doll...
...but Mr. Hendrix couldn't find it.
He looked all over for it, but he couldn't find it.
Doesn't that strike you odd?
It strikes me odd too, Mr. Talman.
-Was he lying?
-I don't know, but we're gonna find out.
Now, look around.
Familiarize yourself with the place.
We're coming back here tomorrow.
And the doll is here, you're sure?
Lisa and I checked earlier.
We didn't see it. It's here, though.
Did you look in here?
Well, anyway, we don't work safes.
I know, but you talk, and that's why you've been invited to this party...
...to talk your way into that big, black safe, sergeant.
-There's a locked closet in the bedroom.
-Not there. Just clothes.
-How do you know?
-I looked.
-You got the key?
-It's on the ledge above the door.
No, it isn't.
They must have taken it with them.
Lock the closet when they don't bolt the front door?
They're strange people.
They lose dolls.
I think you just made a mistake.
I'd like the key.
Well, if you...
All right, fat man, over there.
Both of you through the door, backwards.
If you'd only said please.
And now I'd like the key.
Please?
Go look.
Well, she was trespassing, Mike...
...poaching...
...going into business for herself.
Bad news.
Things like that go on, what do you have?
Anarchy.
No discipline, no sense of order.
Bad news.
Out!
-Haven't you forgotten something?
-We just earned the money.
I mean fingerprints.
You just signed your names all over this place.
Even if you could remember, it'd still take you hours to wipe them up.
If not days.
As for me...
...well, I've only touched one thing since I've been in here.
And now it's clean...
...like me. No police record, no known associations with Lisa.
Nothing, in fact.
I could let you go and what would happen?
I'd evaporate.
But you? Bad news.
Don't forget this, sarge.
And the icebox, don't forget the icebox.
Carlino, knock it off!
We can prove where we were when this happened.
Oh, and when did it happen?
-Just before you let me in?
-So?
So if you do exactly what I tell you...
...there will be no police, there will be no problems.
Go on.
First, get her out of here.
Roll her up in this.
I got a van by the corner.
I'll bring it out front.
Why not the back, where there's less publicity?
There's no back door.
We'll dump her where I found this.
Give me a hand.
-She'll be found.
-I hope so.
All she's got on her is a hotel key.
When they check...
...they'll see she's Mrs. Harry Roat Jr.
-From Scarsdale.
-Right.
This changes things a little, you know?
That's what I figured.
We'll talk about it later.
No, we'll talk about it now.
It was 2000 each. Now it's 4.
Get behind the door, and, you, back there.
Stay dead still.
She's alone. Don't breathe.
Sam?
Sam, are you here?
No, Susy, I'm not here.
Gloria?
-Hendrix here.
-Hendrix here too.
I called to tell you I was the best in blind school today.
-That's my girl.
-I really truly was, cross my heart.
And I believe you.
So can I tap my way over to your studio?
Not now.
Some female with the unlikely name of Lejiana is due any minute for a sitting.
Well, I'll wait for you here, then.
Look, I'll tell you what. Since this Lejiana character is already late...
...I'll just stick around a few more minutes.
So can I come over and wait for you in the coffee shop downstairs?
Sure.
Won't be hard to find me.
I'll be the one reading Peter Rabbit in Braille.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Damn it. You're supposed to be there.
Gloria, I know you're there.
Mr. Hendrix won't wait forever.
Shall we go to work, children?
Two plus two, 4000.
Two plus two, Mr. Talman.
Highly recommended.
Disposable, you buy them in enormous rolls...
...from Hammacher Schlemmer.
Spread out the rug.
Trouble.
Trouble.
-Hi, Susy. Hey.
-Hi, Shatner.
Let me help you with that mess.
Oh, you're a lovely cavalier, only don't tell Sam you helped me.
I'm supposed to be learning total self-sufficiency.
Why don't you come down for a drink tonight?
I can't. I'm off to Vermont for a couple of days of chasing stretch pants.
By the way, I haven't been able to get in touch with our slumlord all day.
And my skylight's still broken.
-If you see him...
-We never see him.
He's owed us a new refrigerator since we moved in, so he doesn't come around.
Don't let it get you down.
Have a good weekend.
On Monday, we'll form a tenants committee or something jazzy like that.
Some committee. Me, you, Sam,
Gloria and her mother.
Oh, well.
-Ciao.
-Ciao.
-Susy?
-No, Batman.
-Safe to open the door?
-All right.
-You want to give me a hand, darling?
-Sure.
Who are you doing?
Gloria.
She's been after me for weeks to take some pictures.
I promised I'd have these done.
I've got to go to Asbury Park...
-Asbury Park? I thought you...
-Sorry, I only found out this second.
That's all right. I was just planning something silly.
-Will it hold till tomorrow?
-Sure.
Someone called from the chemical company.
They saw my Sunday Times spread.
They want me to make their new factory look like the U.N.
Another night shot.
They're paying handsomely.
That's the last one.
-Can I go with you?
-Sure, but I'll...
Be home much quicker if you don't.
You know there was a murder around here last night?
They found the body this morning.
A lady from Scarsdale.
I heard it on the radio.
So?
What if I get chopped up in little pieces and dumped in the river?
Little tiny pieces that nobody could ever recognize...
...as having been a poor, defenseless, blind lady...
...whose husband was off in Asbury Park.
-You're not listening, Sammy.
-Sure I am.
Why don't we have some light around here?
They're always finding bodies in New York.
Not in the parking lot practically next door, they don't.
-You're making it up, Susy.
-No, I'm not. I promise.
I told you I heard it on the radio.
Really, I did.
Come on, Susy.
The police don't have the first notion who did it.
Pretty spooky, don't you think, Sammy?
Tell you what I think.
I think it's a ploy to make me stay home.
Well, there was a murdered woman found from Scarsdale...
...and that's a true fact.
And you're afraid for your life, that's a true fact?
No, but it was worth a try.
Fourteen.
-You sure he'll go?
-Yeah.
-He'd better hurry or he'll miss the bus.
-He's got time.
This is some day for a schlep out to Asbury Park.
-When does your bus leave?
-Five.
Time for another cup of coffee?
Maybe half a cup.
If that doll woman calls, tell her I haven't found it yet.
Let Gloria look around for it while she's down here. It must be somewhere.
I don't want Gloria today.
I don't need her.
-Yes, you do, for your shopping.
-No Gloria!
-Give me a hint?
-You can find it by yourself.
If you couldn't, I'd tell you.
-What have you got against Gloria?
-A lot.
The problem is, she's in love with you, which makes me the villain.
Susy, she's a kid.
More to your left, in front of you.
I'd rather have a dog.
Dogs can't shop at the supermarket.
They can't rearrange the furniture either so I trip over it.
That's her latest hobby.
I nearly broke my leg last night.
She's been sneaking cigarettes too.
I smelled smoke when I came in yesterday.
Susy, give her a chance.
Her father's run off again. Her mother's flitted out for a weekend uptown.
Poor old Gloria gets slammed around like a Ping-Pong ball.
On top of that, she's wearing glasses.
Kids are giving her the treatment...
...calling her the "monster from outer space."
Icebox needs defrosting, darling, only my way this time.
It's more practical.
Use plenty of boiling water.
-What if I burn both my hands off your way?
-Don't.
The Unguentine's in the emergency drawer.
If the weather's okay, try walking to the studio and back.
No cheating.
Do I have to be the world's champion blind lady?
Yes!
Then, I will be.
I'll be whatever you want me to be.
Tell me what you want, and that's what I'll be.
-Susy...
-I mean it.
I don't want you ever to be anything but Susy...
...because that's the way I love you.
Do you? Do you?
What do you think?
-Do you want me to stay home?
-Yes.
But you can go to work anyway.
I'll clean up here...
...then when you get back,
I'll be all scrubbed and polished.
You sure it's okay?
Then, I got to rush.
Where does the icebox plug in?
You'll find it.
No fair asking Gloria either.
Sam.
Are you looking at me?
-Bye, dope.
-Bye, dope.
Thanks for everything.
Okay, Mr. Talman, it's time for your soft-shoe.
And remember, there's a nice, little, pink kid running around the house.
And she wears glasses.
Sam.
Gloria!
Somebody!
Operator.
-Please...
-Fire department.
There's something burning.
I'm blind, and I can't locate it.
-It's getting worse!
-Can I have your address?
27B...
Wait, I think somebody's here.
Come in!
The door's open.
-You all right?
-There's a fire. Can you see it?
-I'm blind, and I don't know where it is.
-Oh, yes, I've got it.
-Careful.
-I'm all right. Please find the fire.
It's in the ashtray.
It's only a cigarette butt.
A filter and a bit of paper making all the smoke.
Where was it?
It was on the...
What is this, a safe?
Against the wall? Yes.
I couldn't tell where it was coming from.
Smoke...
Smoke isn't my favorite thing.
-I don't know you, do I?
-No, Mrs. Hendrix.
My name's Mike Talman.
I used to know Sam.
I can't thank you enough for being here.
And I'm sorry that Sam isn't here.
He won't be back until later tonight.
That was stupid of me.
I should've phoned...
...but I thought I'd take a chance and maybe grab Sam for a quick beer.
Wait. Let me give you a hand with that.
-You got it.
-Thank you.
I haven't seen Sam for years, but some people you don't forget.
Oh, Sam you don't forget.
I don't anyway.
He saved my life.
How do you mean that?
-I mean, he saved my life.
-That makes two of us.
That makes two of us, Mrs. Hendrix.
Susy.
Susy.
Thank you.
You mean in the Army or something?
In the Marines, yes.
The 3rd Battalion.
-Charlie Company.
-Right.
-Has he ever told you about that?
-No. Tell me.
No, you ask Sam.
Oh, please. He won't tell me.
You'd better ask Sam.
He likes to do things his own way.
-You're just as mean as he is.
-That's us.
-Mean Mike and Mean Sam.
-Well, you are.
Would you like a drink, Mike Talman?
No. No, thank you.
Are these Sam's, these pictures?
-Yes.
-Yeah, I thought so.
Hey, here's one of me.
I sure have put on a few pounds since those days.
Tell me something, did you know Sam then?
No, we only met a year ago, not long after my accident.
You...?
You lost your sight in an accident?
Yes, in a car crash or really the fire from the crash.
One day, I was practicing crossing at the lights...
...and the cars were piling up around me like mad, and...
...suddenly, a man named Sam grabbed me.
And that was that.
Gloria?
-Who's that?
-A little girl.
Come in, Gloria.
She went out.
Well, I'm sorry to have missed Sam, but I'm happy to have met you.
You're very lovely.
Sam's lucky.
So's Susy.
Goodbye.
Please tell Sam that I stopped by.
Next time I come in from Phoenix,
I'll drop a line first.
Thank you forever and ever for...
Oh, Lord! Hello? Are you still there?
I have to have your address.
Listen, I can't tell you how sorry I am to have kept you.
You're wonderfully good to have stuck around.
-did you find the fire?
-Yes, it's out.
-It was just a cigarette.
-Okay, then, ma'am?
Yes, thank you.
Everything is now.
Goodbye.
How awful.
Mike?
Who's Mike?
Hello, Gloria.
-Who was that man?
-Friend of Sam's from the Marines.
You wouldn't know him, dear.
Oh, I see.
Is the grocery list ready?
The supermarket closes soon.
It's on the typewriter with the $5.
Can you see it?
Oh, and, Gloria?
When you come back, give me a hand with the icebox.
I've got to defrost it while Sam's away.
-What did you do then?
-Switched it to defrost, of course.
-That's not how it's done.
-It is too.
I've done it for Mother hundreds of times.
Your mother's refrigerator is modern.
This one's ancient.
We've got to do it Sam's way. We...
Okay, do it Sam's way, then.
I'll go to the A&P.
Did you close the door?
Yes.
-I didn't hear it shut.
-Okay, so it's open.
-Please shut the door.
-Close it yourself. You're nearer.
Gloria, close the door.
-No!
-Gloria!
No, I won't!
Listen, little monster,
I won't put up with this one more minute!
What's that?
What are you doing?
Stop it!
Stop it! Gloria, do you hear me?
Stop it!
Stop it!
You shouldn't have called me names.
I don't call you names.
I shouldn't say things like that.
It was wrong of me.
-It's okay.
-No, it isn't okay.
People shouldn't say that to each other.
They're mean things, and people shouldn't say mean things.
Guess I get terribly frightened sometimes.
I'm not a very good blind lady, Gloria, and I'm still not used to all this...
...dark brown.
I get cranky and impatient and...
-I know I look dreadful half the time.
-Oh, no. You're gorgeous.
What a lovely thing to say.
Thank you, Gloria.
But I do wish I could do things.
You know, important things like...
...cook a soufflé or pick a necktie...
...or choose the wallpaper for the bedroom, you know?
Sure. I know.
I want to be gorgeous.
Guess you can't have everything, huh?
I guess not.
I'm sorry, Susy, for being horrid.
And me for being an old crank.
-We break anything?
-Oh, no. I only threw unbreakables.
-That was crafty of you.
-I learned it from Daddy.
Okay, pumpkin, let's clean all this up, and you can hop off to the supermarket.
Look out!
There's a knife there.
Thanks.
Run along. I'll put this away so I know where to find it.
-Right. See you later.
-Okay.
Bye.
I should very much like to speak with Mr. Sam Hunt, little girl.
Who's he?
Well, he doesn't live here.
-Leave, little girl.
-Susy!
-Susy!
-Leave, little girl. Go about your business.
-Gloria, what is it?
-I should like to see Mr. Sam Hunt...
...and tell Mrs. Roat that I should also like to see her. Where are they?
-Who are you?
-It's not right, you know, and it's not fair!
-Well, tell me what you...
-In there!
What is it you want?
What are you doing?
You can't go in there.
Tell me who you are.
Here! I was right, you silly thing, and now I've got the proof.
You tell Sam Hunt to leave her alone or I'll fix him!
-Please...
-Good and proper!
Oh, yes, yes.
Don't touch me.
Susy, it's Mike Talman again.
I think I left a package.
Mike!
-Susy, what's wrong?
-Mike.
There was a man here.
He flew in like a black crow.
He's gone now. It's all right.
-I'm scared.
-I'm here now. It's all right.
You must be so bored with me.
Every time you come,
I'm in absolute panic.
No, no, no.
Bedroom's a mess.
He's dumped stuff all over the place.
I better call the police.
He might have stolen something.
Do you know the number?
That's the emergency number anyway.
That's good enough.
Don't worry.
I'll take a later flight to Phoenix...
-...and stay as long as you need me.
-Could you?
Of course.
Hello?
Police?
And the guy just busted in?
That right?
Yes, he was at the door when the little girl went out.
Gloria from upstairs.
Yeah, I got that down.
-Then he pulled out the drawers.
-Sergeant, obviously the man's crazy.
Why don't you send a report and have him picked up?
Just tell me the facts.
I'll decide what to do, if you don't mind.
Well, I do mind.
-You act as if nothing happened.
-We'd better let the sergeant do it his way.
Thank you, lady.
The important thing is, this guy didn't steal anything, right?
No.
No, not as far as we know.
I think I'll help myself to that drink now.
Sure.
Well, I won't bother you anymore.
If there's anything missing, call the 6th Precinct and let me know.
-Thank you, sergeant.
-Anytime.
Bye.
-Can I fix you something?
-No, thanks.
Hello.
Oh, just a minute.
It's for the sergeant.
I'll get him.
Sergeant!
Sergeant!
-What is it?
-You're wanted on the phone.
Sorry to trouble you, Mrs. Hendrix.
Afraid this is going to be one of those days.
Thank you.
Carlino here.
Yes, lieutenant, go ahead.
He just walked in?
Well, what's a doll got to do with it?
Sure.
Sure, I understand.
Right.
Mrs. Hendrix, I might as well mention this while I'm here.
I don't want to alarm you...
...but there was a woman found near here this morning.
-I know.
-You knew her?
That's not what I said.
I know what happened.
I heard it on the radio.
Oh, I see.
Did your husband happen to know her, by any chance?
-My husband?
-Of course he didn't.
I'm sorry, Mr. Talman,
I was asked to make inquiries.
Did you hear anything peculiar yesterday afternoon or evening, Mrs. Hendrix?
No, I didn't.
We were out all afternoon.
I go to blind school, and my husband was at the studio.
Was there anybody with him at his studio?
-No.
-Hey, wait a minute. What is this?
He was supposed to photograph a girl, and she didn't turn up.
Nobody can verify he was there or what he was up to?
Are you questioning her for a reason?
-I'm not questioning her.
-Why are you taking notes?
I'm allowed to talk, you know.
Sure, but she's allowed not to.
She doesn't have to answer.
Don't they study the Constitution at police school?
-You some lawyer?
-No, but I know her rights!
I didn't think you were.
Well...
Goodbye, Mrs. Hendrix.
I'll probably be back.
-Mike?
-Well, he was certainly a big help.
Is...? Is this room dirty?
No. Why?
The sergeant kept dusting things.
-Did he?
-Yes.
Over by the refrigerator and...
...the banisters.
Here.
I'll get it.
Sergeant probably forgot his badge.
Forgive me for bursting in on you like this, Mr. Hunt.
No. Mr. and Mrs. Hendrix live here.
Hendrix. Oh, I'm terribly sorry...
...but is this 27B Saint Luke's Place?
I'm Mrs. Hendrix. Can I help you?
My name is Roat. Harry Roat Jr.
What is it, Susy?
-Mr. Roat, Mrs. Hendrix is blind.
-Oh, I see.
I'm sorry for intruding upon you and Mr. Hendrix...
-No, my name's Talman.
-Yes, well, whatever.
Mrs. Hendrix, has my father been here?
-The old man?
-Yes, do let me explain.
I'm so embarrassed.
It all must be just a terrible mistake.
He made a mess of Mrs. Hendrix's things.
You better straighten him out.
Well, he's not crazy, I assure you.
He's not crazy.
He's just very old, and he thinks a photographer named Sam Hunt lives here.
He's very old, my father, and very worried for my sake.
He thinks that my wife has been...
...seeing this Mr. Hunt.
And that's why I've troubled you with my...
Hi, Susy, I've got the groceries.
Thanks, Gloria.
I'll put them away.
Okay.
-See you.
-Bye.
You know, you really do have the wrong house, Mr. Roat.
-Here.
-We don't know anyone named Hunt.
I don't know this man Hunt either, dear lady. May I explain?
Three years ago...
...my wife was on vacation in Montreal with my mother and father.
And while she was there, my wife became acquainted...
...my father says, with this photographer named Sam Hunt.
Now, my father says that they've been seeing each other...
...from time to time ever since.
My wife is...
...very beautiful.
-What is all this about, Mr. Roat?
-Well...
...I believe my father followed my wife to this apartment.
You're wrong.
You see, the other afternoon, there was a big scene.
There were testy words between my wife and my father...
...and my wife stormed out of the apartment with her doll.
Her doll?
Yes, the doll was what started the bad words that day.
It was especially made for my wife in Montreal to play her favorite tune.
The point is that when my wife left the house, my father said to me:
"Sam Hunt gave her that doll.
Do you know that?"
And then he ran out of the house to look for her.
Later, my father called and said he lives at 27B Saint Luke's Place...
...in the basement apartment.
And then this morning, when I told Dad that Lejiana hadn't...
Lejiana?
Yes. Lejiana, my wife.
When I told Dad that she hadn't come home last night...
...he got terribly excited and drove off in my car...
...so I finally decided to come here on the off-chance that...
-Your wife didn't come home last night?
-That's right and...
Want me to get it, Susy?
Hello.
Yeah. Hang on.
Susy, it's that Sgt. Carlino.
He wants to speak to you.
Why?
-May I take a message?
-I'm leaving now.
-No, I'll take it.
-Forgive me for intruding.
Well, his son's here now.
Don't go. He wants to talk to you.
-Who? Who does?
-The police.
-Say I've gone.
-It's about your wife, Mr. Roat.
Hello.
Speaking.
That's right. No, she didn't.
In fact...
Was she hurt?
No, tell me now.
-Mr. Roat!
-Mike!
Oh, I'm frightened.
I'm very frightened.
Don't worry, Susy.
He's gone.
Mrs. Roat is dead.
She was murdered last night near here.
-What did you say?
-And the police think Sam did it.
-Sam?
-Yes. The doll.
The doll.
The one Mr. Roat Jr. described.
Sam brought a doll exactly like that back from Canada.
I was trying to help him unpack from the trip when something fell on the floor.
The something played a little tune.
The something was a doll!
Mrs. Roat's special-made, handmade, made-in-Canada doll. Sam had it!
I thought it was a surprise for me, but it wasn't.
It was for a little girl in the hospital.
A woman at the airport asked Sam to carry it for her...
...so that her other girl, who was meeting her, wouldn't see it and get jealous.
The woman called yesterday about getting the doll, and Sam couldn't find it.
Sam never met the doll lady in his life before. He told me so.
Don't do this to yourself, Susy.
Then there was the woman he was supposed to photograph.
Sam said she didn't show up.
But he was away a long time waiting for her.
And her name was Lejiana, and so is Mrs. Roat's.
Well, suppose he did know her.
It's not so serious.
Oh, but it is.
All right, then.
Let's say that it's serious.
Let's try to figure this all out.
From the beginning.
First, the old man came in screaming about Sam and Mrs. Roat.
He went into your bedroom and tore it apart.
He messed up your dresser.
Why did he do that?
He must have taken something, Susy.
He just must have.
Come here.
Now, look.
Check, feel around, see if anything's missing.
Our wedding picture's gone.
The one of Sam and me.
Do you see it anywhere?
No.
That's the meanest thing I ever heard of.
I'm calling the police.
No!
No, Mike, we can't.
We mustn't say anything to the police. Nothing.
They've got to forget all about us, Mike.
They think Sam did it!
Please.
What is it?
-That's funny.
-What's funny?
There's a police car pulling up outside.
They're just standing there.
Susy, I think they're watching this house.
Don't worry.
It's no good, Mike.
What?
The doll. I can't find it.
Hold on. I just found another suitcase.
What?
I just found another suitcase.
Any luck?
Well, just some papers.
And some letters.
Well, if any of them are from Mrs. Roat, don't bother to read them to me.
Oh, they're from you, Susy.
You type very well.
I didn't know Sam was a hoarder.
Listen to me. We've got to face the fact that Sam's in trouble.
We've got to find that doll.
It's the one thing that proves that Sam's connected with this.
But it's not here.
We've looked for it.
Well, now, wait a minute.
You're the one who told me.
You said that Sam brought a doll back from Canada.
You said it's the same doll that Roat described.
You went right down the line and told me that it proved...
...that Sam and Mrs. Roat were connected.
And now Mrs. Roat's dead, murdered right next door.
-Maybe I was wrong.
-That doesn't matter.
If you thought that way, the police will think that way.
Without the doll, it's a lot of ranting and raving from those crazy Roats...
...but with it, the police have a case involving Sam.
-Mike...
-Do you understand?
Mike, did you notice how I jumped when Mr. Roat Jr. came in here?
-Have you been listening to me?
-For a moment, I thought it was the old man.
He had on the exact same shoes as his father. New shoes.
And one of them squeaked a little bit.
-You probably didn't notice.
-No, I didn't.
And another thing, it's winter.
-It's dark early now, isn't it?
-Yes.
Then why has everybody been playing around with the blinds?
-What?
-Mr. Roat did it.
And Sgt. Carlino did it too.
Mike.
Is that police car still outside?
I'll check and see.
-Yes, and they're looking this way.
-See their faces, the policemen in the car?
-Not very well. It's pretty dark.
-Try. This is important.
-Why?
-Is one of the policemen Mr. Roat?
-Is it?
-No.
No, it isn't.
There'd be a radio inside a police car, wouldn't there?
Yeah, I suppose.
What are you getting at?
Sgt. Carlino fiddles with the blinds...
...and immediately, the police phone and ask to speak to him.
Then Mr. Roat Jr. fiddles with the blinds, and Carlino calls him.
No, I don't think the police work like that. It's too cops and robbers.
Mr. Roat's story and Sam's don't go together.
And I've been forgetting something very important.
-What's that?
-That I know Sam...
...and I don't know Mr. Roat.
You've got to get this through your head.
It's what the police think that counts.
If we wanna help Sam, we've gotta find that doll...
-But it isn't here! It isn't here!
-It must be!
-It's got to be in this safe.
-But I told you, it couldn't be.
-And why not?
-Because it isn't ours. Not really.
The woman who had this apartment wanted to sell it to us when we moved in.
When we convinced her that we didn't want it...
...she locked it and deliberately dropped the key down the drain outside.
-Susy, you're making that up.
-I am not. Why should I?
-Be careful.
-Why should I?
On second thought, I don't suppose
I'd open my safe in front of a stranger.
Have I been treating you like a stranger?
I wish the doll were in the safe.
It is your problem, isn't it?
Yours and Sam's. You have to do what you think is best for him.
Where are you going?
To pick up my things at the apartment.
I can't miss the last plane.
-You said you'd stay.
-Sam will be home soon.
Will you give me a phone number?
What phone number?
Where you're going, in case I find the doll.
I'll phone when I get there.
Give me the name of your friend so I can call Information.
Well, yeah, I may have it written down someplace.
-Here it is. Can you remember it?
-Yeah.
-Cl2...
-242. That's like ours. Go on.
Right.
Mike?
Thank you.
Five, nine.
-Where's Roat?
-Who knows?
Out beating up old ladies.
How goes it inside?
She's something, man.
She is really something.
Yeah.
You're on next. Give her a minute, then push her as hard as you can.
Really push. Keep hinting at that safe and the doll.
If it's in there and she can't open it, she will after you've gone.
What about Roat Jr. from Scarsdale?
Yeah. What about him?
Who's that?
It's only me, Susy.
Thank goodness.
When I got upstairs, I found I'd left a stick of butter in the bag.
Do you remember the man who was here when you brought the groceries?
-Which one?
-Not Sam's friend. The other one.
-Sure.
-What did he look like?
Kind of dumb-looking, I guess.
-You'd recognize him, wouldn't you?
-Yeah.
Come.
Get up on a chair and look out the window.
There's a police car out there. Can you see the face of the man inside of it?
There's no police car.
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.
There's no car out there.
Well, yes, there is, a kind of squatty truck. Right by the phone booth.
Phone booth?
Is there anyone inside the truck?
Well, there's a man standing near it.
Is it the man who was here when you brought the groceries?
I don't think so.
Susy, he's coming this way.
Watch out. He's looking through the window.
-Can he see you?
-No, but he's still looking.
I think he's going. He's go...
You had it!
-I was only borrowing...
-We've got to hide it.
-Where is it? Give it to me.
-Under your feet.
I was only borrowing it.
That's why I brought it back.
Where are we going to put it? In the washing machine. Come. Help me.
-Gloria?
-Yeah?
How would you like to do something difficult and terribly dangerous?
-I'd love it.
-Can you see the phone from upstairs?
-From mother's bedroom, I think.
-Good.
Go upstairs and watch that phone booth.
Don't take your eyes off it for a second.
Now, if anyone from the truck goes in and makes a call...
-... phone me as soon as they come out.
-Got it.
Just let the phone ring twice and then hang up. Remember, twice.
-I know. Like a signal.
-Good girl.
Susy, if you need me for anything, just bang on the water pipes in the corner.
-Who's that?
-Sgt. Carlino.
Quick, under the stairs.
I'll be right with you, sergeant.
Just a minute.
Coming.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm glad you dropped by, sergeant.
Some children were playing out back, and I think they broke a window.
-Would you mind taking a look?
-In here?
I think so.
There's nothing broken here.
Well, maybe in the bathroom.
It's hard for me to tell.
There's nothing broken anywhere.
Look, Mrs. Hendrix, I understand
Mr. Roat called on you this afternoon.
Yes, he was here for a moment.
You've been looking for something, I see.
I couldn't find the garbage bags.
No?
Do you know what I think?
You can't find that doll.
It's not that. I couldn't find the garbage bags.
No, the doll! The doll your husband brought back from Canada.
-The doll he gave Mrs. Roat.
-My husband did not know Mrs. Roat.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hendrix, that's just not true.
Mr. Roat recognizes your husband from a photograph his father has.
And old man Roat remembers seeing your husband and Mrs. Roat together.
Now. Now, I wonder where that doll can be.
-In that big, black safe maybe?
-No, there's nothing in the safe.
There is no doll, and my husband never knew Mrs. Roat.
He did, as a matter of fact, know her.
Now, if you don't open that safe...
...I'll get a search warrant and drill it.
It'll take me less than 10 minutes and before your husband gets back.
-Who are you phoning?
-The 6th Precinct.
I want to speak to Mr. Roat.
-Operator?
-Wait a minute.
Mrs. Hendrix, I'll get him.
I can get through quicker.
-Hello?
-Sixth Precinct, Carlino speaking.
Go ahead.
Is Mr. Roat Jr. still there?
Mrs. Hendrix wants to speak to him.
Hold on, I'll see.
It's for you, Roat Jr.
-Hello? This is Harry Roat Jr.
-Mr. Roat, this is Mrs. Hendrix.
My lawyer has advised me...
...that if your father makes any more accusations against my husband...
...he will have to take immediate action.
Do you understand that, Mr. Roat?
Yes. Yes. Right.
Thank you, Mrs. Hendrix.
Thank you.
That lawyer friend of yours isn't going to stop me, Mrs. Hendrix.
Be right back. With a search warrant.
Must be the wrong number.
Like I said, I'll be right back.
And don't forget...
...don't leave this house.
-Hello?
-Mike, is that you?
-Yes, Susy. Is something the matter?
-I've got it. I've got the doll.
Great.
Where was it?
I'll tell you when you get here.
Can you come right over?
-I'll run all the way.
-Okay.
Oh, and, Mike? Everything's gonna be all right now, isn't it?
Yes, Susy. Everything will be all right.
Mike?
No!
No.
No.
No.
Carlino? No.
-Operator.
-Operator, the police. Emergency...
-Susy, it's me, Mike.
-You must have the wrong number.
Who was that? Who are you talking to?
Some children. They call sometimes and say cruel things.
I don't suppose they mean it.
The doll, Susy, where is it?
Where did you find it?
That's the silly part. I don't know why I didn't think of it.
-I should have remembered ages ago.
-That doesn't matter. Where is it?
-You'll think I'm such a fool.
-Susy, don't complicate things.
-Give me the doll, then Sam will be safe.
-That's what's important.
-If anything happened to Sam...
-Susy, where's the doll?
I'll get it for you. Would you give me the key ring that's on the nail by the icebox?
Are these the ones?
Yes.
-You wait here, Mike. I'll be right back.
-Wait a minute. Where are you going?
To the studio. To Sam's studio.
That's where it is.
How do you know the doll's at his studio?
Gloria just told me.
The little girl with the groceries.
She went over there to do an errand for Sam, and she saw it.
-And heard it. It played a little tune.
-Are you sure about this?
Yes, positive. If it hadn't been for
Sgt. Carlino hounding me...
...I could have told you earlier.
Okay, Susy, fine. I'll go get it.
Where is the studio?
Just two blocks away, 78 West Eighth St.
It's on the top floor.
And the desk is in the far corner, away from the window.
It's a big old thing with a roller top.
You know the kind I mean, with cubbyholes and pigeonholes and...
-Yeah, I know the kind you mean.
-It's in the left-hand drawer, the doll.
Gloria said so.
Susy, I'm gonna ask you once more.
This is no time for mistakes.
Are you sure the little girl saw the doll?
Are you sure this is all true?
I'm saving my husband's life, aren't I, Mike?
I'll be right back. You stay put.
-Make a cup of hot coffee or something.
-Whatever you say, Mike.
Susy! Susy, it's me.
Those men who just went out, who are they?
-Where are they now?
-Careful. Two of them went up the street.
-The one that looked in the window...
-Carlino. Yes?
Well, he's outside.
Guarding or something.
Now...
...the first thing we have to do is stay calm.
I'm calm, Susy.
Yes, I know you are. I really know.
It's the best thing I ever heard.
-Are they detectives?
-No, they're not detectives.
They're sure not detectives.
The one out on the street, can I get by him?
-Not without his seeing you.
-Then I have to stay here.
-You've never really met him, have you?
-No.
Good.
You know the Port
Authority Bus Terminal?
It's near 42nd Street. Take a taxi.
The driver will know where it is.
-42nd Street.
-Here. You'll need this.
What should I do?
Ask if the bus has arrived from
Asbury Park.
-Asbury Park. Say it.
-Asbury Park.
Meet every bus from Asbury Park.
Stay all night if you have to.
Sam will be on one of them.
Can you do that?
Of course. What shall I tell him?
Everything. All about the three men.
Sam will know what to do.
-As soon as you're safe, I'll call the police.
-Okay.
I wish something like this would happen every day.
Oh, I'm a Girl Scout.
Wanna buy some cookies?
Sure you don't wanna buy a few boxes? I get points.
Buzz off, kid.
Well, okay. Guess I better try to make points with someone else.
Operator.
No. No.
Oh, no. No. No.
They can't. They can't.
They can't do this. Please, Sam! Sam!
Oh, God.
All right, all right,
I'll meet you in the parking lot.
Okay, bad man.
Susy?
Susy. It's me, Mike.
How long have you known?
You've been to the studio, Mike.
-Oh, that's right.
-And there was no doll.
More fun still, there wasn't even a desk.
Poor Sam. He really ought to have a desk.
But you don't know Sam and about him needing a desk.
-Mrs. Hendrix...
-Susy. We're not strangers.
All right, Susy. Game time's over.
I want the doll.
No.
-I'm afraid you don't have any choice.
-Oh, but I do.
-I do have a choice.
-No, you don't.
Damn it, you act as if you're in kindergarten.
This is the big, bad world full of mean people, where nasty things happen.
Now you tell me.
Look, Susy, you listen to me, and you listen to me good!
I'm through playing around.
You give me that doll, and you give it to me fast!
Give it to me!
Okay, Susy.
You win.
Sam didn't kill that woman, did he,
Mike? He didn't even know her.
He met her at the airport, just exactly like he told you.
Did you kill her, Mike?
-No.
-Mr. Roat?
That isn't important.
It hasn't got anything to do with you or with Sam. It never did.
It was a whole separate thing for me and Carlino and Roat.
-You don't belong to any of it.
-It's different with Mr. Roat, isn't it?
I think it's more than the doll with him.
He said he wants to do evil things.
You don't have to worry about Roat.
Roat's dead.
He didn't like us, you know. Any of us.
So we had to get rid of him.
We flipped a coin. Carlino won.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
What are you gonna do now, Mike?
Disappear. Like magic.
You're a good, strong lady...
-... Susy Hendrix.
-World's champion blind lady.
Oh, yeah.
You're all of that.
-And, Susy?
-Yes?
I want you to know...
What is it?
Mike?
Mike!
What are you doing, Mr. Roat?
Gasoline!
Well, Susy...
Now all the children have gone to bed, and we can talk.
-What are you gonna do with gasoline?
-Well, you just guess.
Now guess.
No!
Please, no!
-All right!
-I thought that would save time.
I'll get you the doll.
Oh, that's a good girl.
Go to the head of the class.
Mike.
It's just a chair, Susy, so you can sit down.
Did you know they wanted to kill me?
I did. I knew it even before they did.
They were awful amateurs, and that's why you saw through them.
-I saw through you too.
-No, not all the way, Susy.
Even now, not all the way.
The lovely thing was the way
I let them set it all up.
All that silliness of meeting in the parking lot, the whole thing.
They had comic-book minds, so we did it their way, right until the end.
And then topsy-turvy.
Me topsy and them turvy.
-Where's Sam? Where did you send him?
-Clever, Susy.
-Where is he?
-He's on his way to Bellevue Hospital.
There was a message for him when he got to Asbury Park.
One of those short, formal things.
Your wife has had a slight accident, you know.
So he took the first bus and is racing to your bedside.
So we don't have too much time together.
-You killed that woman, that doll woman.
-I don't wanna talk about Mrs. Roat.
-Are you gonna give me that doll, Susy?
-I can't...
I don't believe you, Susy.
I can't! I don't have it anymore.
Look, what is that? Stop it!
Now, I'm not gonna ask you again, Susy.
When do you wanna tell me where?
You're gonna tell me.
-I can't! It isn't here!
-You're lying again.
-What is that?
-It's just...
It's just my hand.
Well, now.
Why don't we stand up?
I said, stand up.
Now, go into the bedroom.
Mr. Roat?
-Are you looking at me?
-Yes, Susy...
Stop!
Don't touch that!
I have your knife, Mr. Roat.
And I've got the matches, Mrs. Hendrix.
No, no.
No, no, no! No more! No, no, no!
No! It's out! It's out. It's out, I said!
Cut it out!
Stop!
Try lighting your match now, Mr. Roat.
Throw your matches over to me. Go on.
Don't move. I still have your knife.
Pick up the cane.
Tap on the floor right where you are so I know where you are. Go on. Tap.
Tap.
Keep tapping.
Keep tapping.
Keep tapping.
Tap.
Keep tapping.
Tap. Tap.
Tap.
Louder.
Louder!
Tap.
Well, Susy.
It's all over.
Drop the knife.
And the matches.
Down we go.
All right.
All right, you can have it.
You can have the doll.
I'll give it to you if you'll just go and...
-Yes, Susy?
-Not hurt me.
Say, "please."
-Please.
-No, that's not quite it.
"Please may I give you the doll?"
Please may I give you the doll?
You may.
The doll.
Catchy tune.
Well, Susy, now I want you in the bedroom.
-You said you wouldn't hurt me.
-Did I?
I must've had my fingers crossed.
Good girl.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Window.
Where is it?
Where is it?! Oh, God!
Wait! Wait!
You stay here. Do you understand?
All right, come on. Look out.
Hurry!
Here! Let me try.
Take it easy.
Don't waste your time.
Susy!
Susy, where are you?
-Susy!
-You know this man?
No. Susy, for God's sake, where...?
Must be in the bedroom.
I tried. It won't work.
All right, bring your flashlight.
I got some bulbs in here.
My God, where is she?
I'm gonna have another look in the...
God in heaven.
-Susy! Susy!
-Wait!
Sam?
Over here, Susy.
I'm over here.
You're by the chair.
Great girl.
I'm over here.
You're doing fine.
Just fine.
Sammy!
[ENGLISH]
No! No!
Help... help!
Are you still going into town, doctor?
You see that's how one gets greeted in the village.
Death rules here.
If I may, please give me 50 crowns.
I am sorry, but I cannot go on from here.
Sorry, I gave you a ride to this place, because I needed the money.
The inn is further ahead, after that arch.
It won't be difficult for you to find it.
Just ask for directions, it's the only inn in town.
You see this is a condemned place, a God forgotten place.
Nobody ever comes to this place.
You better come back, doctor, before it is too late.
I am looking for the inn.
Can you tell me where it is?
It's over there.
I'm looking for the inspector.
Inspector Kruger.
You are the doctor, aren't you?
In this village, we never liked doctors.
Quiet!
Dr. Eswai?
Yes!
Come. Come.
The inspector is waiting for you.
Enough!
I said I know nothing about
Irene Hollander.
I didn't know her, inspector!
You, too, know nothing, haven't seen or heard anything?
You all have the same answer!
Look, you can't fool me!
Why such reluctance?
What keeps your tongue tied?
Is it fear maybe? Fear from what?
Tell me! From what?
An amulet!
An amulet!
That's what's keeping you from talking.
It's superstition, ignorance.
But, I will get you to talk!
So that you will tell me what happened, you'll see!
You made it.
I was getting worried about you.
I left immediately, but it wasn't easy getting here, Inspector Kruger.
We are isolated from the world here, nobody ever comes to see us.
This is Mr. Keirr, the burgomeister.
Go, but wait with the others downstairs.
Have you lived here for a while,
Inspector?
I arrived here the other day.
I asked for you to come here for a very serious matter.
Take a look at this letter.
It's from Irena Hollander, a girl who worked as a housekeeper at a villa.
The villa of the Baroness Graps.
I can't resist it anymore.
I have decided to talk, to break the cycle of death... a great burden to me.
Come soon, because this time it feels like it's my turn. Irena Hollander.
That letter came to the police station... and I came here to check what was indeed true.
The girl, unfortunately, was already dead.
Impaled by the spears of a gate.
A homicide!
I still don't know.
They keep wanting me to believe that it is a curse.
But this letter makes me think about something totally different.
But it will be up to you to figure it out, doctor.
You'll have to do an autopsy.
Burgomeister, we'll continue with the interview tomorrow.
Nobody can leave!
Have you figured something out,
Inspector?
I keep hitting a wall of silence.
They are afraid, of everything.
They are afraid of my questions, it's as if they are being terrorized by something.
On the other hand, I understand their distrust towards strangers.
You are without doubt the first authority who has made it to this place.
Their only belief system is superstition.
Earlier, they were carrying a casket-
A casket? When?
When I arrived.
I think I get it now.
They are trying to prevent an autopsy on Irena Hollander!
Come with me, doctor, quickly!
Rufus, Argo! Stop!
What are you doing?
Who told you to bury her?
Wasn't I clear enough?
The doctor came for the very purpose of doing an autopsy!
It's against the law of nature to touch the dead.
Take her to the mortuary.
When can you start?
Right away.
But a qualified witness is needed.
There are guidelines
I have to follow.
I told you to move the corpse inside, immediately!
As to the witness, don't worry.
I'll send you-
Inspector! Inspector!
The burgomeister sent me!
He wants you to come back to the inn.
He couldn't keep the people you were trying to interview.
He wants to talk to you immediately!
Okay, I am coming.
Go do what you have to do.
Once you're done, come join me.
All right.
Mr. Keirr!
Mr. Keirr!
Why have they all left?
I am sorry! But there was nothing
I could do about it.
I tried to keep them here for the interrogation.
But once they found out that you had gone to the cemetery, they ran away.
Evidently you don't have much power over these people.
Well, it's not a matter of power.
Inspector, I beg you!
Stop the autopsy!
I have to solve this case!
Listen to me! You must not let the body of Irena Hollander be touched.
I was hoping that you would cooperate with me.
I see that you are siding with them, to hide the truth.
No! No, Inspector!
I made you come back, to explain to you... the village does not speak, not to cover up something... but out of fear.
I am not ashamed to admit that I am afraid... about what may happen to me... if I reveal... the secret of Villa Graps.
Villa Graps?
It sounds like an impossible story, something above the laws of nature.
It will be difficult for you to believe me.
But the death of Irena Hollander... is not due to an accident.
It is murder!
Are you Dr. Eswai?
I am Monica Schuftan.
The Inspector sent me to assist you.
I was actually looking for a physician.
I am a science student from Grottenburg.
I am the only one here who will be useful to you.
So, you are from the village?
Yes, I was born there. But I have gone since I was one year old.
I returned on the same day this girl died.
Have you ever attended an autopsy?
No, never.
That's incredible!
They slipped a coin into her heart!
Just like the legend says.
It's an old legend, which has been circulating around here for centuries.
It says that only a coin in the heart would bring peace... to those whose lives ended violently.
In spite of the autopsy, we are unable to conclude... whether we are talking about an accident or a suicide.
Oh, that coin!
Who could have slipped it into the heart of that poor girl?
And why?
Don't worry about it, Monica.
Inspector Kruger will clear up everything.
I am here now, this is where I live.
I am Mrs. Morano's guest.
I don't mean to be intrusive, but why did you come back to this village?
I came back to visit my parents' graves.
I never knew them.
They left me with a small fund, which
I lived off before going to college.
Thank you for telling me.
You have been really brave.
Thanks.
I wish you a good night, doctor.
Good night, Monica.
I already told you, doctor, not to touch the dead.
He who touches them has to pay with his life.
We had to, we had to bury that girl!
Why didn't you do that?
Stop it!
Doctor!
Doctor, the inspector went to Villa Graps because of an emergency.
He left an hour ago and left you a note in his room.
Didn't he say when he would be back?
Nobody ever makes it back from Villa Graps.
Why are you saying this?
I didn't say that. I didn't say that.
It's not true. Stay away.
Go to your room right away.
Dinner is ready.
No!
No! No! Not me! I didn't say anything,
I didn't say a thing!
Darling, what's happening to you?
At the window!
Did you see her?
Oh my God, that's terrible!
Now that she is scared, there's no more hope!
Only Ruth can do something.
Go and get her! Quickly, hurry!
You were looking for me, right?
I could feel that you needed me.
Dear Eswai...
the burgomeister revealed things to me that I find unbelievable.
I am heading to Villa Graps to meet the Baroness...
to inquire about something important.
Join me there as soon as you can.
Sincerely, Inspector Kruger.
Calm down, girl.
It won't happen to you.
The curse will not touch you.
Get her undressed.
Blood! Strengthen yourself.
Death will not touch you.
Stay away, stay far away from the Villa.
Stay far away!
Stay away!
Stay away!
I heard her.
She's here!
It's because I opened my mouth!
Don't say that, darling daughter!
I tell you, I heard her!
This will protect you.
You can never take it off.
I am done now.
No, no, go out this way.
They cannot see you.
I helped her pay her bill.
Why did you exorcise this girl?
You can help me here.
You certainly must know a lot about this village.
Why do people seek help in your magical skills?
What are they afraid of?
There is a terrible curse hovering over these people.
Be careful, you, too, are in danger.
Irena Hollander was thrown to her death.
But, by what?
Leave, doctor! Those are things that science cannot explain.
Give the inspector a warning right away.
Send him away as well.
And stop this investigation.
Inspector Kruger is at Villa Graps to wrap up the interrogation.
He is a practical and driven man.
He doesn't get influenced by imagination.
He will get to the bottom of the matter.
Where is the Villa?
I'd like to join the inspector.
Don't go, doctor.
Don't go there. I mean it.
They talk about this villa with such terror... as if even afraid to say its name.
It's something I need to clarify.
Villa Graps is over there.
Wait a moment.
You can't tell me anything about this coin either?
I found it today inside
Irena Hollander's heart.
I was hoping that you would help me understand.
I already told you that I know nothing.
Go ahead, if you wish.
But still not too late for you to choose not to go.
Thank you.
I hope we will meet again.
If he ever makes it back from that villa.
Keirr, my love.
What's the matter, Keirr?
And there is another one.
It is a mortal chain this one, and it will never break!
Death rules at Villa Graps.
Yes, there is death.
It can be stopped only by death itself.
Leave now, Keirr.
We have to call the hearse right away.
You know the dirt has to cover the body immediately before the sun rises.
With its weight, the dirt embraces the dead... and keeps it in the earth forever.
They won't take you with them.
You will be at peace.
Kruger!
Inspector Kruger!
What do you want?
Excuse me, I am looking for
Mr. Kruger, the inspector.
There is no inspector.
But I was told that he came to see
Baroness Graps.
I am the Baroness Graps.
And nobody ever comes here.
I am alone here in this villa. Leave!
No, wait!
Leave! It's for your own good!
Leave me alone!
Hi.
What's your name?
Melissa!
My name is Melissa.
Melissa?
Melissa!
Oh no, no! No, no, no!
Mrs. Morano, I beg you! Mrs. Morano!
What do you want?
Open up! Mrs. Morano, I am afraid!
Open up, I beg you!
Go away!
What goes around comes around.
You shouldn't have touched that girl!
Paul!
Monica! What are you doing here?
I came to see you.
What's wrong?
I had a nightmare. I got scared.
I couldn't stand it anymore!
Calm down. You must be shaken by the autopsy.
The cord isn't moving.
Take me away, Paul.
Take me away from here.
Did you see that? It was the wind.
No, no, it wasn't the wind.
It's the hatred, the bell is being moved by the hatred.
It always sounds this way when someone has to die.
It's been this way since she died without a drop of blood in her.
Who?
It was a seven-year-old girl.
She would hang on to those cords of the bell, looking for help!
Her name was Melissa.
Melissa.
Listen, the lady will stay here this night.
Let them prepare a room for her.
And, has Inspector Kruger come back yet?
No, I haven't seen him.
Martha!
Yes?
Martha, go upstairs. We need to get a room ready for the lady.
Right away.
Paul! Did you hear what the innkeeper said?
It wasn't the wind making the bell sound!
Monica! Don't let it affect you this way!
But this is not like in the other cases.
Even the church is condemned.
It's a wreck. People seem to have no faith anymore.
No, they are just people in poor spirits, victims of superstition.
Miss, you can come upstairs now.
Good night, Monica.
Good night, Paul. And thank you.
Nadienne!
Nadienne, what's wrong?
You are boiling, such high fever!
What are you feeling?
What are you doing here?
What do you want?
Leave!
This is none of your business!
Isn't she suffering enough already?
You can't touch her!
Let it be!
A cilice!
What have you done? Are you crazy?
Do you want her to die?
Madmen!
Your methods are absurd.
She could die of these wounds.
My daughter will die anyway.
Nothing can save her.
Shut up! Quiet!
Don't worry, Nadienne.
It will all be over, you'll see.
It's nothing bad.
They... they picked me.
They picked me! They picked me!
I know I won't be saved. I know.
She is very agitated.
Her pulse is irregular.
What should we do?
She needs to rest.
I will give her a sedative.
I left my luggage in the inspector's room.
Let's go, Martha.
Give this to her when she wakes up, not more than 20 drops!
- Don't hesitate if you need me.
- Thank you, doctor.
Furthermore I feel it necessary not to say anything about...
what the burgomeister Karl told me,
Inspector Kruger, after several meetings.
The burgomeister says that the village suffers from a nightmare of a curse...
that started with the death of little Melissa Graps.
Since then, according to the belief of these people...
Melissa keeps returning by appearing to the living.
To make matters even more incredible...
the people Melissa appears to, each die under mysterious circumstances...
which the farmers call supernatural.
Let's hurry!
There's no time to waste.
Hurry, hurry!
Paul.
There are lights at the cemetery.
What might that be?
Yes, I saw them, too.
It could be Inspector Kruger.
Maybe he has discovered something.
No, don't go there!
I'm not sure if it's Inspector Kruger down there.
What would he be doing down there at night?
I don't know.
But I want to see what's going on.
Kruger...!
No, no!
The burgomeister lives here.
Keirr!
Mr. Keirr!
Yes, I am here. Come on in.
Come in, doctor.
I knew you would come.
I found the body of Inspector Kruger at the cemetery.
I know.
I arranged for it to be taken there.
He died by a gunshot to his temple.
Don't use this tone with me.
I didn't say that I killed him.
Another victim of the demonic forces, right?
And maybe even he had a coin in his heart!
Yes.
To keep his spirit from answering to the call... of Melissa.
I understand this may seem impossible to a man of science like you.
I read what you reported to
Inspector Kruger.
You can't expect me to believe those legends!
I didn't believe them, either.
They aren't legends... but a horrible reality instead.
In the last few years more than ten people were thrown to their deaths.
All of them were sane, without worries.
None of them had enemies.
We are all in danger here.
Listen to me, Eswai.
Leave as soon as possible.
You, too, Miss, leave!
You should have never come to this village!
I was born here and the bodies of my parents are resting here.
The tombs you placed your flowers on... are not the graves of your parents.
The Schuftans never had any children.
No...
That's impossible. That's not true.
This is another absurd invention.
I have proof as to what I have said.
The Schuftans left me a sealed envelope... to give to you in case you should return.
I kept it in my utmost care.
The Schuftans were servants at the Villa Graps.
Your fate, like ours, is connected to this Villa.
I will bring you that envelope now.
Remember, doctor... the answer you are looking for can be found at the Villa Graps.
Do you think there is some truth to it?
Keirr!
Keirr!
Keirr!
No... No...
Open up! Open!
Monica!
Monica!
I can't take this anymore!
I can't take this!
Stop it for God's sake!
They will kill all of us here!
Stop it!
Help.
Let's go get someone.
Come.
Come out!
The burgomeister is dead!
Cowards!
You are such cowards, you'll get yourselves all killed!
Nobody will ever help us.
They are afraid!
Let's go.
Go away, you murderer!
You killed my daughter Nadienne, enough now!
Leave, leave!
Damn you!
It's your fault that my daughter is dead!
Go away!
Leave or I kill you!
Let's go.
Monica!
Monica!
Where are you?
Monica!
Monica!
Monica!
Monica, what's the matter?
How strange, Paul.
I came here as if I already knew this passage.
It feels like I have already been here.
Paul, I've never been here... yet I feel like I have already seen this place before.
We are locked inside, the lock has snapped shut.
There is nothing I can do.
It's impossible to open it.
Let's find another exit.
This must be the Graps family crypt.
Melissa Graps.
Maybe we can get out from there.
No, it's not possible.
It's locked down there.
Paul!
It's Melissa.
Melissa... Melissa.
My little girl. My daughter.
Why did you come here?
You shouldn't break the peace of my little one.
Why?
Baroness, terrible things are happening in the village!
The village gets what it deserves!
They always hated us, the Graps family!
They let my little girl die twenty years ago.
The village was celebrating, everybody was drunk.
One of them ran her over with a horse.
She begged for help for a long time, desperately... but nobody would help her.
In my opinion, they should all be condemned!
And she bled to death.
Bastards!
Come, come!
Please, come.
Come.
I left her room as it was.
Here... she would play here.
She was full of life.
Happy, always without worries.
She liked to see herself in the mirror.
She wasn't able to reach up there.
She had to stand on her toes here.
This was her favorite doll.
Everything has stayed the same as she had left it.
With her dolls... she had so many of them...
Melissa!
Melissa!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul!
No!
You have recovered, Dr. Eswai.
You are lucky. I found you in the park just in the nick of time.
You, too, were plunging towards death.
The silver coin.
At this point I can't do anything else for my dear Keirr...
The silver in your heart will bring you eternal peace.
I did everything I could to keep him from dying.
I have dreaded this moment day by day.
I loved you so much!
My life without you has no more purpose.
I will vindicate you, Keirr.
I will go to Villa Graps, even if it will cost me my life.
And Monica... Where is Monica?
There is no more hope for Monica.
She is Melissa's sister, the second daughter of the Baroness Graps.
Yes, Monica, you are my little girl.
I knew that you would come back to me. Wait.
The Schuftans were my servants.
I was the one who kept you in college.
If you really are my mother, why would you do such a thing?
Well, in order to keep you away from the Villa.
I was worried for your life.
This is you, Monica.
You were two years old.
And there is Melissa, your sister.
After Melissa's deadly accident... they all died in this Villa by Melissa's hatred.
Melissa cannot hate anymore now, she is all ashes by now.
No!
No. You saw her.
She is still here.
She uses me to return among the living.
I am a medium with supernatural powers... which I cannot control.
See, with these irresistible powers,
I am their victim.
They draw their strength from me, in order to survive.
I know... I know that they are evil.
But I can't stop them, I am their slave, they constantly force me... to call upon them!
No! No! No!
All of this is absurd, unreal!
I have to find Paul.
Please, help me.
Take care of yourself! Leave!
Here, they are coming. I feel them.
Let them go!
No. I can't let go of them.
Go away! I said leave!
You should go as well. Melissa has been waiting for you for twenty years.
Leave!
Leave!
Melissa!
Melissa... Melissa...
Enough!
Baroness Graps, you are done killing.
I have finally decided to put an end to this curse.
Ruth... you are playing with your fate.
Because it says you will die in this house.
This doesn't matter to me anymore.
I will put an end to this curse.
No, you have no powers over them.
You will die, too.
I have to vindicate Keirr.
You shouldn't have killed him.
Your time has come!
You will pay for what you did to him and all the other innocent victims!
You are the cause of all that's happened.
You who calls upon past spirits to use for your hatred... that has driven you since your daughter died!
No! It's them, it's not my fault.
It's them who force me to do so.
It's not my fault.
It is them who force me to do those things. No!
You call upon Melissa with your skills as a medium... in order to invade and throw to their death the people of this village.
They could not use their free will... and those poor people were unable to resist.
But now your maleficent powers are coming to an end!
"To an end... "?
You are a murderer!
You even want to kill your own daughter Monica.
Yes, I hate her as well.
The Schuftans kidnapped her from me and escaped through a tunnel.
They didn't want Melissa to get to them.
I hate them all. You will die.
You will all obey me, all of you!
Monica!
Monica!
Monica!
Monica! Open for God's sake!
Die you damned bitch!
You and all your demonic creatures!
Monica!
This nightmare has now come to an end!
The chain of death has finally been broken.
...things, I heard, as it were,
...the voice of much people in heaven saying,
..."Alleluia."
"Salvation and glory and power is to our God."
"For true and just are his judgments..."
"...who hath judged the great harlot which corrup..."
"...with her fornication..."
"...and hath revenged the blood of his servants at her hands."
And again...
Come, gather yourselves together to the great supper of God.
That you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of tribunes...
...and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses...
...and of them that sit on them...
...and the flesh of all freemen and bondmen...
...and of little and of great.
And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth...
...and their armies gathered together to make war with him...
...that sat upon the horse...
Bring on some water!
...army, and the beast was taken...
...and with him the false prophet...
...who wrought signs before him,
...wherewith he seduced them...
...who received the character of the beast...
...and who adored his image.
These two were cast alive into the pool of fire...
...burning with brimstone.
And the rest were slain by the sword of him that sitteth upon the horse,
...and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
The year is 1645.
England is in the grip of bloody civil war.
On the one side stand
<the Royalist party of King Charles,
...on the other, Cromwell's parliamentary party, the Roundheads.
The structure of law and order has collapsed.
Local magistrates indulge their individual whims.
Justice and injustice are dispensed in more or less equal quantities...
...and without opposition...
...an atmosphere in which the unscrupulous revel...
...and the likes of Matthew Hopkins take full advantage of the situation.
In a time where the superstitions of country folk...
...are still a powerful factor,
...Hopkins preys upon them,
...torturing and killing in a supposed drive...
...to eliminate witchcraft from the country...
...and doing so with the full blessing of what law there is.
However, his influence is confined...
...largely to the eastern sector of the country, East Anglia,
...which is held firmly in Cromwell's grasp...
...but not so firmly that the
Roundhead cavalry patrols...
...have everything their own way,
...for there still exists an ever-present threat...
...from the remnants of the Royalist armies,
...desperately foraging for food, horses, and supplies.
Stop that, Richard.
What?
What you're thinking.
What am I thinking?
Ungodly thoughts of your Sara, that's my guess.
Thoughts of Sara, yes.
Ungodly?
Depends on how you look at it.
And you, a supporter of Cromwell...
Hold your talking, you two.
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.
We'll be stopping in a few minutes to give the horses a rest.
You can gabble all you want then.
Fifteen minutes and we'll be on our way again.
Get down!
Royalist snipers.
Probably only a few of 'em after food and horses.
We'll flush the bastards out in no time.
Marshall, you scout behind to keep an eye on the nags,
...and the rest of you follow me and keep spread out.
Captain, look! There's one!
I see him! Follow!
Harcourt, this way.
Robert?
Captain?
Captain Gordon, is that you?
We're here, Trooper Marshall.
It's quite all right.
- Getting a bit nervous, were you, lad?
- Aye, just a bit, sir.
Well, no need to worry.
We got 'em all, I reckon.
Not quite all.
One of them got away, sir, though I put my sword in him first.
We'd better move on out of this wood, then.
If he has got away, he could still be dangerous.
Swallow, bury Brace's body as soon as you can.
Look out, sir!
Thank you, Trooper Marshall.
He was trying to kill you, sir.
I gathered that, Trooper.
It was a lucky shot, sir.
Yes.
Nevertheless, it could have ended my career for good.
Right, we move out.
Swallow, join us as soon as you've finished your business here.
Harcourt, give him a hand to remove the bodies.
Yes, sir.
So, you granted young Richard here leave, did you, Captain?
- I did.
- Aye, two days.
Then, you'll be away to see your girl,
I suppose.
And how will she greet you?
Just promoted cornet for killing king's men.
She knows my reason for fighting, and it's only while the trouble lasts.
What are you laughing at?
Leave him be, Robert.
Can't you see he's in love?
Aye, I'm not ashamed of it, either.
A toast, lads, to the lovely women of Suffolk.
And may they keep their beds warm for General Cromwell's gallant men.
Come on, boy.
Nearly home.
Well!
Master Marshall, welcome.
I trust you're well, sir.
My body is as strong as ever, but..
The war continues?
Aye, we still fight.
And why...
Well, my company's recruiting.
I have two days leave.
Then, you must eat with us this evening.
I thank you, sir.
We still have good food for all you soldiers take it from us.
And ale.
Come, we shall drink together.
After your experience,
...it is likely our village has grown a little smaller for you, eh, Richard?
Not so much smaller as lacking in promise, perhaps.
In Ipswich or Cambridge, a man might find better opportunities.
Richard, if you took Sara to wife...
You mean, you'd give us your blessing?
You would take her away from here?
You honor me, sir,
...but I only have a small farm that belonged to my father...
...and my soldier's pay, which is far from...
I am little concerned with your ill-kept lands.
And still less for the silver you get for killing good Christians.
Well, forgive me.
That was unjust.
But there is trouble coming to this village,
...and I want Sara far away before it arrives.
Surely Suffolk should be free from the king's armies.
It's not only the king's armies which bring death this year.
A lack of order in the land encourages strange ideas.
You mean more rebellion?
I'm sorry.
You have worries enough already.
But give me your word that you will soon take Sara away from here...
...and you shall ask her consent tonight.
You have my word on that, sir.
Good, Richard. Good.
That's right, my dear,
Master Richard Marshall.
Farm boy into soldier.
Welcome back, Master Marshall.
I'm glad to be back, Mistress Sara.
By the way, Sara,
I expect the meal at the usual time.
Yes, Uncle.
Your uncle has agreed to our marriage.
Oh, Richard!
The army has taught you rough manners.
Sara, why is he frightened?
There have been threats to us since you were last here.
Threats? Why?
We've been called Papists and idolaters,
...and filth chalked up on the walls.
They say we are king's creatures and should be pilloried and worse.
Who says these things?
We've become outcasts in our own village.
Rest easy.
Now, no one shall harm you.
I put my oath to that.
And have you arranged a day for the wedding, Richard?
No, sir.
Much depends on how the armies move.
Ah. Remember, it must be soon.
But how certain are your fears of this danger?
Perhaps just an old man's bad dream,
...and being an old man,
I must early to my bed.
Good night, my dear.
Good night, Uncle.
Oh, and Sara, remember to see the doors are well bolted.
Yes, Uncle.
And, Richard, don't keep Mistress Sara up too late.
Country women need full eight hours in their beds...
...if they're to be proper wives and mothers.
Good night, Cornet.
Good night, sir.
And will you make a proper wife and mother, Sara?
I still have much to learn, Richard.
I'll teach you.
Now... didn't your uncle just say you must early to bed?
- He did.
- And isn't he a wise man?
- He is.
- Right.
How much further, Matthew?
You'll not call me Matthew.
I'm not one of your drinking cronies...
...carousing and wenching in the taverns.
Aye, you're not that, sir.
Remember, John Stearne, you ride with me...
...only because you help me in my work.
You call it work?
It's the Lord's work, a noble thing.
And a profitable one.
The Good Lord paying in silver for every hanging.
That is blasphemy, Stearne.
Hold your tongue.
I'm merely an honest man who helps you get your confessions.
The law has prescribed due methods of interrogation.
And I have been blessed with the skills to carry them out.
Oh, stop your gabbling.
We have work to do in Brandeston.
Who is it this time?
- The message tells of a priest.
- A priest?
One who gives worship to Satan and calls him Lord.
Mm, with the priest himself a witch,
...there'll be others corrupted, too,
I'm thinking.
You enjoy torture, don't you, Stearne.
And you... sir?
Good-bye, sir.
God be with you, Richard.
Good-bye, Richard.
Good-bye, Sara.
I'll see you again soon.
Given up ale for stargazing,
Tom Salter?
Not stargazing, Master Marshall.
Waiting.
What for?
Matthew Hopkins, a lawyer.
Must be important, that you wait after dark.
It is that.
Aye.
Well, if I see a lawyer on the road,
I'll tell him you're here.
Hup.
How far is it to Brandeston, friend?
- About three miles.
- Thank you.
- Are you the lawyer?
- Aye.
- Name of Hopkins?
- Aye, Matthew Hopkins.
And this is my assistant
John Stearne.
Why do you want to know, soldier?
There are some men from the village back there waiting for you.
Aye, they sent for us.
What would a lawyer want in Brandeston?
A man who may not be what he seems to be.
Come, Stearne.
- John Lowes is his name.
- An evil man.
- A Papist.
- Yeah, burning candles and all.
That is no proof of witchcraft in itself.
Dressed himself in devil's garments, he did.
- And made unholy signs.
- Aye, he did. I saw him.
I will find out the truth for you.
Have no fear, friends.
Yes?
John Lowes?
So, it has come to this.
You accuse me, a priest, of working with the devil.
We can only judge by the evidence.
And there's a lot of that, old man.
I reject your accusations totally.
He's gonna give us trouble.
A simple confession, priest, that's all we ask.
Help us.
We've got a lot of work to do in Brandeston.
Leave my house, the pair of you!
I told you he was going to be difficult.
I reject your foul suggestions.
Leave here at once!
All you reject is the true God!
Take him, Stearne.
- Look for the devil's marks upon him.
- Right.
Help us, you two.
Look, he still prays to Satan.
Get on with your task.
If the devil made you a priest,
...he's gonna have hidden his mark with a lot of care.
To what purpose is this?
When the devil buys a soul,
...he marks the person's flesh so we will know him.
If such a mark is pricked, no blood will flow nor pain be felt.
Mistress Sara! Mistress Sara!
They've come for him!
They've come for the old man!
Quick! Hurry!
Seems Satan has hidden his mark well, Matthew.
Set him to running.
Quick, then, you two, around the table.
And keep him moving.
You would be his niece.
- Your name, child?
- Sara.
I am Matthew Hopkins, witchfinder.
Being his niece, you, too, may be corrupted by Satan.
No, not his niece.
A foundling taken in by him and his housekeeper.
- Are you telling me the truth, child?
- Yes, yes, of course.
When she died, I became his servant.
And you've remained innocent all of these years?
Yes, sir, entirely.
I trust you know the old man.
Better than anyone.
In private talk, we may shed some light on his innocence.
Private?
Yes, away from the distraction of the crowds.
Perhaps in the quiet of your room tonight...
...you might be able to help me prove him guiltless.
Would you release him now?
You might be convinced tonight that this is all needless.
And you will make every effort to present the facts to me?
You may come to my room tonight, sir.
At what hour?
At 8:00.
If you'll release him now.
All right.
He can sleep in the jail, and we'll be rid of him.
Come on!
Get up, you Papist bastard!
Has he confessed yet?
Not a word.
Well, then, stop this.
But he hasn't confessed.
Take him to the jail.
We'll continue the interrogation tomorrow.
Jail...
You heard what he said.
Quiet down, you animal.
You know what, Marston?
There were these couple of right filthy girls.
Filthy they were!
Horrible to behold. Horrible!
- Witches?
- Yeah, both of them.
We hanged them, Matthew and me.
Matthew. You know Matthew.
He's my partner.
Did it take you long to get a confession out of them, John?
Well, a couple of days with one of them.
- The other one...
- Do you want more ale, sir?
Yeah...
Go on, then. Come on.
What about the other one?
- Tell us about her.
- Oh, yeah, the other one.
Now, she was a real strange one, she was.
Loved us for it, like she wanted to get strung up.
Reckon that was the only bit of excitement she ever had.
Well, go on, then, Mr. Stearne.
Go on.
Filthy...
Sara, I've come to question you.
You came here for a purpose, sir.
I came here to get your evidence about the priest.
He's been kind to me.
Perhaps he had a motive.
Men sometimes have strange motives for the things they do.
I know.
My motive in coming here was to... find the truth.
How about the priest,
Master Hopkins?
We'll have done with him in a day or two.
Have no fear, child.
- He's been good to me in his way.
- He is an idolater.
He must confess and die.
Stearne will see to that.
Oh, no, please!
Don't let him be harmed, please!
You seek to protect a witch from rightful justice?
Oh, no, not that, but couldn't he be kept in a cell?
He could do no harm from a prison cell.
- Oh, please!
- But justice must be done, my dear.
Grant me this.
Please, Matthew.
Past noon, you unkempt lout.
Get up!
Get away!
I need air.
Where's the priest?
Where you put him, in the jail.
We'll, uh, get him out and start questioning him, then, eh?
- No.
- What?
- He stays where he is.
- But we have no confession at all.
I said we'll leave him in the cell.
All right, then. All right.
Um, what about the women?
When are we gonna start interrogating them?
I hear tell they've a good few witches around this place.
When you're in fit condition.
I'm fighting-fit as it is.
Oh, and where were you last night,
Matthew?
- I hear tell you've been a-wandering.
- You hear tell too much, man.
You there. Old man.
Master Hopkins, the witchfinder,
...he says you're to be kept here, interrogated no further.
Where are you off to, John?
I'm going for a walk.
By myself.
Tell me!
Tell me!
Tell me!
Tell me that!
Come on. Tell me!
Confess, witch!
Tell us your foul iniquities!
No!
Your familiars, woman.
Confess!
Stop.
Stop.
For God's sake, stop.
Quiet, old man, and be thankful you're not getting the same.
Tell me when I ask you!
How many of them?
A dog? A ferret?
Come on. Tell me!
John.
The witchfinder, he's coming.
I trust you are using the prescribed methods, Stearne.
Naturally.
Has she confessed?
Well, give me time.
She's only been here an hour.
Continue with the interrogation.
I shall be gone for a while.
You're always going off somewhere... sir, aren't you?
What do you mean?
Nothing.
I've been called over the hill to the next village.
I shall be back by tomorrow.
You will remain in charge here.
Carry on your work while you're away, aye, sir?
Indeed.
And the priest?
I said to leave him be.
What do you want?
You.
Where's Master Hopkins?
Gone.
Gone?
- Where?
- Just gone.
He's left me in charge.
No!
Help me!
Help me.
No!
And don't think I don't know why the old priest is being spared, eh?
Stearne, the priest,
I've changed my mind.
Confess!
Confess.
He confessed.
You heard him.
I've heard nothing yet,
Master Hopkins.
Refresh Master Salter's memory,
Stearne.
You heard him.
You did, too.
Yes, Master Hopkins.
Witnesses.
Get up, you blasted witch! Get up!
Come on!
You are, all of you, confessed idolaters.
However, these proceedings shall be carried out...
...through due process of law.
What law demands, we shall satisfy.
You will each be tied in a prescribed fashion...
...and cast into the moat.
Should you then sink,
...we will know that your confessions are false.
If, on the other hand, you are seen to swim or float,
...then your confessions of witchcraft are proven beyond a doubt...
...in the sight of God,
...and you will be withdrawn from the water...
...and hanged by the neck until you are dead.
You can't hang me!
The law forbids it! I'm with child!
And who would want to make you pregnant, witch?
Quiet.
Stearne, go on with your task.
Oh, God, help me!
Help me!
Help.
Hey, look!
One of them's gone already.
They swim.
The mark of Satan is upon them.
Give us a hand here! Come on!
They must hang.
She was innocent.
God forgive you, Matthew Hopkins.
Jailer...
...take them to the tree.
The money from the magistrate, nine guineas in silver.
Good. Now we can leave.
- Good morning, soldier.
- Good morning.
What'll you be after in the way of horses, then, aye?
A dozen or so for General Cromwell's armies up north.
Well, lost a few, have you?
Aye, at Cheriton Wood.
That's a pretty sorry looking bunch of old nags you got in there, friend.
The best we could find.
Then, they'll have to do.
- A dozen you say, eh?
- Aye.
We'll be back in Suffolk soon,
...where, thank God, they still breed strong horses.
Oh, I doubt you'll find much better there.
I'm just back from those parts.
The mounts up there are much like these.
Have you been through Brandeston at all, man?
Brandeston? Aye.
And a fine commotion they're stirring up there.
What, over you taking their horses?
No, nothing like that.
- A mass hanging.
- Who?
Witches, I heard.
Two women and a priest.
Where was the priest from, man?
Brandeston, I suppose.
A brave old boy for all his white hairs.
Was he a friend of yours?
Two troopers, Gifford and Harcourt, will be here directly.
Have 'em take these horses here back to the regiment...
...and report that I'm delayed.
I'll join them further north.
Do you understand?
Yes, but where will you be going to?
Maybe not.
Sara!
Sara?
Sara!
Sara.
Sara!
Sara!
Sara!
They took him and killed him.
They said he was an idolater.
I know. I heard.
- Sara...
- One of them... the witchfinder...
...he...
...he...
I didn't want to...
I thought I could save him.
I thought they'd have pity.
We kneel before thee, oh, Lord, in humility...
...to ask for a blessing on our union.
We ask for forgiveness of our sins...
...and strength to lead righteous lives as man and wife.
We pray, also, for the soul of thy servant, John Lowes.
May he know eternal peace.
And it is in thy sight, oh, Lord, that I hereby swear...
...I shall not rest from the pursuit of his murderers...
...till they stand before thee ready to answer to thee for their sins.
Take this money and whatever you need from the rectory...
...and go to Lavenham.
- You'll be safer there.
- I will, Richard.
Find lodgings and stay there.
I'll come to you.
I love you very much.
Oh, Richard!
Shepherd, I seek two men.
Witchfinders, they call themselves.
They were said to be headed this way.
- Matthew Hopkins and his assistant?
- Aye.
I've heard they're in Hoxne, about four miles yonder,
...but I can't be sure.
Thank you, shepherd.
Get out!
Oh, come on, Johnny, give us a kiss.
Oh, get away from me.
Oh, stop it, you dirty rascal!
Stop it!
Here, I'll bet you two pennies.
Get another drink.
Go on, Johnny. Be a love.
- Ale, soldier?
- Aye, to wash the dust from my throat.
- Another one for you?
- Aye, get a move on with it.
She's got a powerful thirst still.
Landlord, I'm looking for a man called Hopkins.
- I heard he was coming this way.
- Matthew Hopkins?
Would you know where he is, friend?
Aye, he's gone to Cambridge today.
But you got an accusation to make,
I'll get your confession for you.
I do the pricking, you know, not Matthew.
...I'm your man, friend.
John Stearne, they call me.
I'm husband to Sara Lowes.
You all right, friend?
Yeah.
You better get out of here.
Yeah, I'm going. Don't worry.
As for you, soldier,
...you're coming down to see the magistrate.
Am I?
Not with you!
Quick, Matthew!
For God's sake, Stearne, what have you done?
- Who was that?
- Richard Marshall.
- Who?
- He's married to the girl... Sara.
- How did he find you?
- He was looking for you.
He found out about Brandeston.
We're going to have to separate.
I won't run from him.
We have work to do down south in Lavenham.
Not me. He's after our blood.
Seems to me he's already had some of yours.
Well, he's not gonna have any more, you understand?
You're forgetting our powers.
He could be a witch.
He's a man who's out to kill both of us.
Then, it appears to me...
...that we should take steps to see to his death first.
Come. We travel to Lavenham.
I full well understand your feelings, Cornet,
...but you're an officer of the army, a soldier,
...and desertion is punishable by death.
However, in this case, there are two factors...
...which will stay me from subjecting you to a full court-martial.
One, we are grouped here at Naseby...
...in preparation for a major assault on the Royalist armies.
We need every man we can get.
And you're a pretty good soldier most of the time.
Thank you, sir.
Secondly, I would sleep ill if I had to send to the gallows...
...a man who had saved my life.
But, Cornet, remember this.
If you should leave your command again,
...I will have no alternative...
...but to throw the whole weight of military law against you.
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.
Dismissed, Cornet.
And may God help you in your search,
Cornet Marshall.
Robert, hello.
- Richard, you're back.
- Aye.
What happened with the Captain?
Nothing.
I heard about Brandeston, Richard.
Hopkins and Stearne.
I'll find them somewhere.
But what can you do?
What proof have you that they committed any crime?
I got Sara's word on it.
Is that enough for the magistrates?
There'll be no magistrates involved.
What do you mean?
We'll talk more later, Richard.
We must be on our way.
We're after horses for this skirmish that's coming up.
All right.
Hup. Come on. Hup.
Parliament men.
Comrades of friend Marshall.
There's some good ones coming now.
Look.
Hey!
Let's make a run for it, shall we, while we can.
Be calm.
Yeah, but if they find out who we are, they'll...
They won't. Come on.
That's a fine horse you've got there, friend.
The army needs mounts of such caliber.
I am not selling.
But you will get your money when the war's over.
You don't appear to understand.
I am not selling.
Oh, but you are selling, friend.
And we'll take that one, there, too.
So you filthy soldiers can butcher my mare?
Sergeant, he thinks we're filthy soldiers.
- Do you hear?
- Aye, I heard.
You can't go saying things like that, friend.
What he needs is a little army discipline.
I hear you need more pikemen in your platoon, Sergeant.
You'll pay for this!
Hey!
Good horse you had there.
Cost a pretty penny, I reckon.
We robbed the county mint.
Ah, right jester, he is.
Yeah, well, a day's fighting in Cromwell's army will soon cure your wit, my lad.
I am not doing any fighting, neither for the king or your precious Cromwell, either.
- You mark that well, soldier.
- Yeah, you coward.
Just like your friend.
- Matthew Hopkins is no friend of mine.
- Hopkins?
The fancy boy who just made a fool of your cavalry, comrade.
- You rode with him.
- I had reasons.
- Ah, he pays you?
- We were partners.
- In what business?
- Extermination.
- Eh?
- And what does that mean?
Now...
Matthew Hopkins, sir.
Adequate, very adequate.
We did our best, sir.
Lavenham has served me well,
Master Webb.
Now I must find out how I can serve you.
They're all women, sir.
Strange, isn't it, how much iniquity the Lord vested in the female?
Pardon, sir?
Who makes the accusations?
Myself, sir.
I'm representing the town.
- How many?
- Three, sir.
And what age?
Well, two are young, sir...
Elizabeth Clark and Mary Reynolds.
The other's worn and old.
Mm. Fetch the young pair here to me.
What of the other hag?
Oh, the old ones are more sensible.
It's the young ones who are stubborn.
They require time.
Oh, I see.
- Um, sir?
- Yes, man?
Your assistant, sir...
We were told he, too, would be coming to Lavenham.
He's engaged elsewhere.
He's fighting for the Parliamentary cause.
Oh. He will be joining you here, sir?
I really can't say.
You can manage without him?
Of course.
- I apologize.
- No.
Not only can I manage without him,
...but I intend to instigate a new method of execution,
...and you, Master Webb, you shall aid me in carrying it out.
What's that, sir?
You'll see.
It's a fitting end for the foul ungodliness in womankind.
Yes, sir.
Now fetch that young pair here.
Sir.
An excellent meal, gentlemen.
There is little I find so satisfying...
...as good food after a well-earned victory.
- Wouldn't you agree?
- Entirely, General.
The conflict at Naseby, sir,
...will go down as a triumph of your strategy.
Perhaps.
I would rather that it went down...
...as a triumph for the forces of true godliness.
Nevertheless, your name will symbolize the victory, sir.
Whether I like it or not, eh, Captain?
That cornet you so highly recommended to me,
...is he to join us?
- He's coming now, General Cromwell.
- Good.
Amongst the most pleasurable aspects of victory, gentlemen,
...is the opportunity it affords to reward valor.
It ranks almost with good food.
- Cornet Marshall, sir.
- Mm.
All right. Rest, Cornet.
Your captain has told me about you.
He says you're a good soldier.
Thank you, sir.
He recommends that I promote you to captain.
I thank you, sir.
I have a special mission for you,
Captain.
Take three men and ride back into East Anglia.
The king has escaped us...
...and is rumored to be making for the Norfolk coast.
If that is the case,
...find and apprehend him before he can escape to the continent.
It's an honor, sir.
Pick your men.
Start at once.
If you find the king, you will escort him then to Norwich.
If not, join us in the west.
Good luck, Captain.
Shall we rest up for the night,
Richard?
We got a job to do.
We'll go on till we've done it.
Do you mean looking for the king or finding Hopkins and Stearne?
Both.
Richard, you can't go off and desert again.
I don't plan to desert.
But supposing you do find out where they are?
Then I shall take temporary leave again.
For God's sake, Richard,
I know how you feel,
...but to risk court-martial to kill Parliament's own appointees,
...you'll be hanged yourself.
Robert...
I've taken an oath.
I won't break it.
- It's madness.
- It's justice.
It's my justice.
And what about one of them, sir?
You won't find better horseflesh in the whole of Suffolk.
So, how much are you gonna try to drag out of me if I take that one?
He's yours for a couple of guineas, sir.
A guinea.
A guinea and a half for getting me out of bed at this hour of the morning.
- One guinea.
- And a quarter?
I'll quarter you.
- Ah, you drive a hard bargain, sir.
- Yeah.
And where would you be heading that you need a horse in such a hurry?
- To find my partner.
- Your partner, eh?
And what line of business might you be in?
God's business... witch-finding.
Witch-finding. Oh, that's nice.
That's very nice.
You wouldn't make it a guinea and a quarter, would you?
Do you know a man called Matthew Hopkins?
You know where he is?
I heard tell of such a man down south.
Lavenham, I believe.
What's he doing in Lavenham?
Extracting confessions, I don't doubt.
You let me have that four-legged cripple now!
This happened three days ago.
Why didn't you report it to the militia then?
How should we know it was the king himself?
A stranger, obviously a townsman, tries to hire a boat to cross to France...
...and you suspect nothing?
When the country's torn by civil war?
I didn't know there was a war on till you gentlemen told me so.
Oh, come on, Richard.
We'd better go back.
Aye, I suppose so.
I want to pass through Lavenham, see how Sara is.
- Lavenham?
- Aye. How far is it from here?
About two days ride, I reckon.
They got more excitement over there than any of your city folk's wars.
- What do you mean?
- They're burning witches there, I hear.
Some such rigmarole.
They're in Lavenham!
Aye. Richard!
Elizabeth!
Elizabeth!
Oh, God.
- All is ready, Master Hopkins?
- Aye.
Proceed with the executions, then.
Bring forth Elizabeth Clark.
Right.
Siegel, fetch the rope.
Oh, come on, you little bitch!
No!
Hold still, will ya?
No!
All right, lower away.
Slowly, now. Keep her slow.
Elizabeth!
Master Hopkins, there are two more to be burned.
Yes, Magistrate.
Master Webb... the others.
Here you are, 12 guineas in silver.
To be spent in the service of our Lord, Magistrate.
We must thank you for your good work,
...Master Witchfinder.
Thank you, Magistrate, for your aid.
Leave 'em alone.
Don't want to buy? Move away.
Get out. Get out. Get out.
Witchfinder!
Greetings, Stearne.
Is that all you've got to say...
...after leaving me there with Cromwell's men?
Well, I provided us both with the opportunity to escape.
Only you did and I was captured.
Fortunes of war, Stearne.
You know me well enough...
...to know that I wouldn't hesitate to fire and kill you.
Aye, you would that.
I hold all human life dearly,
Stearne, especially my own.
Oh, come now.
You've escaped and all is well.
Maybe.
I even saved your share of the pay...
...even though I did all of the work myself.
Now, are you going to be sensible, or do I kill you?
By the way, do you know what they call me now?
What?
Witchfinder General.
There are those who think that I should be appointed such...
...for all of England,
...appointed by Parliament.
Here. Look.
Sara... she's here.
Very nice, eh, Matthew?
No, you fool.
Don't you realize that if she's here, that trooper must be around, too?
But he's away fighting.
Suppose he got leave after Naseby, where do you think he'd go?
To see her, of course.
- We better move along then, eh?
- No.
That man Marshall is not going to give up.
He's proved that to us already.
Then, we have to get him before he gets us, right?
We have the power to do it legally.
Prove him a witch, huh?
Exactly.
He'd never confess, not that one.
On his own, no.
But if we had him and the girl?
Yeah, she's the niece of a man we executed for witchcraft.
And Marshall is her husband.
I owe that jumped-up plowboy a seeing-to.
Go out and ask around.
Find out if he's been seen.
If not, we'll tarry here a while until he does arrive.
- Who is it?
- Sara, open the door. It's me.
Richard?
They were here...
Hopkins and Stearne.
I didn't know what to do.
I saw them in the street.
- I didn't know if they saw me or not.
- I know. I know.
Well... I'll be in the tavern with the others, then.
He's here, Matthew!
Just arrived.
- Where's he gone?
- To see the girl.
- Alone?
- Yeah.
The three others are in the tavern.
Go and get us an extra man to help.
Where are we gonna take them,
Matthew?
Up to the castle.
Magistrate here is very helpful.
That's where you interrogated the others, is it?
Yes.
Now hurry to it, man.
What are you going to do?
You say Hopkins arrived two days ago?
Yes, and then he was with the other one in... in the street today.
And they haven't left yet?
I'm not sure.
I've been too scared to leave.
Come on! Open up in there!
Drop that sword, soldier.
This man accuses you, Sara Lowes, and you, Richard Marshall,
...of consorting with the devil.
- Is that not so, Master Webb?
- It is that, sir.
Will you describe your evidence to us?
I observed the accused talking with their familiars...
...and making the signs of Satan, sir.
And what were these familiars to which you refer?
Black cat and a stoat, sir.
You're a very observant citizen,
Master Webb.
Well, Sara...
...do you confess?
And what do you have to say, soldier?
I'm gonna kill you, Hopkins.
I don't think you'll find that easy.
The law is with me, remember.
And what are you?
An accused witch.
They must be submitted to the test.
Take them, Stearne.
Hopkins!
A Royalist sympathizer, evidently.
But what are we gonna do with him?
Leave him.
I'll inform the magistrate later.
We have more important work to do.
Come on.
Get moving.
Orders from the magistrate.
Suspected witches.
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
I heard them.
Where are they taking them?
To the castle to test them.
Test them?
They're accused...
...of witchcraft.
- Harcourt, you come with me.
- Yes, sir.
- Shall I look after him, sir?
- Yes. Try and find him a physician.
I've heard much of how Hopkins conducts his interrogations.
Come on, Harcourt.
All right, Stearne.
Well, Captain Marshall, do you now confess?
Keep at it, Stearne.
You're doing God's work.
Put her over here.
And you, Master Webb, help him.
Master Hopkins and his assistants, are they here, man?
- That they are, sir.
- Well, let us pass, then.
You're here to help the witchfinder?
We're here to find him, yes.
Have you a signed pass?
Sara...
...I'm going to place this iron on your back.
Should you faint or cry out,
...we can only take it that Satan has intervened...
...to... spare you your agony.
However, I could show mercy if...
...if Captain Marshall were to confess to witchcraft first.
But will you do it, sir?
I shall kill you.
So, you have no proper authorization, then.
What do you mean?
From the magistrate.
Authorization.
Not here with us, no.
Well, we'll go back and get one then.
All right.
Then I'll let you pass.
Master Webb, go and see what is the matter.
Yes, Master Hopkins.
What do we do, Matthew?
We shall carry on with God's work as before, man.
And fetch Captain Marshall over here.
He shall kneel before his wife and watch her suffer.
- But, Matthew...
- Go do it, man!
Oh, God!
You took him away from me.
You took him from me.
You took him from me.
You took him from me!
You took him from me!
May God have mercy on us all.
- Have you fallen asleep?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I think you must be in love or something.
Why does the old bitch pick on me?
That's the second time this week. 
I nearly told her what she could do with the job.
Hey, you asleep?
That's what I asked her.
She wants me to stay till 7:00 again.
What polish are you putting on?
- The usual one, madame.
- Oh, I'm fed up with it.
I feel like a change.
- Uh, give me Revlon's Fire and Ice.
- Oh, I'll go and get it.
Madame Denise?
Madame Denise,
Mrs. Rendlesham wants Revlon Fire and Ice.
I don't think there's any left.
Put this on.
She'll never know the difference.
Hello, darling.
How about a bit of the other, then?
You can't eat stuff like this.
Come on.
I'll take you to Wheeler's. Okay?
I have to get back.
Oh, we can have a — we can have a quick meal.
Come on.
I can't. I`ll be late.
Well, just —just one thing.
No?
I can't.
Well, good-bye.
Well, just a —just a minute.
What about tonight?
I'm sorry, but I'm busy tonight.
You really make me feel wanted.
Who's the lucky boy?
I'm having dinner with my sister.
Is she a good cook?
I don't know. I never thought about it.
Well, at least it can't be any worse than fish and chips.
I think we are having rabbit.
Rabbit? Oh.
I thought they'd all been killed off.
- No. She has a friend —
- A rabbit?
No, I think the friend has rabbits.
Poor bunny.
Well, what about tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah. Let's have dinner tomorrow.
I'll meet you at the Hoop and Toy.
You know, the pub along there.
About, uh, 7:00?
- Hello.
- Hello.
Come along boy. Walkies. Walkies.
Walkies. 
Have a good day?
- Darling?
- Yes.
- How was work?
- All right.
It's close today.
- Are you still going away?
- Oh, darling, please don't start that again.
- How long are you going for?
- I've told you.
- Fortnight?
- Mind.
How long?
Ten or 12 days.
No more than that?
I heard such a funny story on the news this evening.
Does he have to leave his things in the bathroom?
The minister of health—
What's his name?
He found eels coming out of his sink.
It was on the television.
Even the announcer was laughing.
Why does he put his toothbrush in my glass?
Carol, please.
We must get this crack mended.
What?
- Hello.
- Hello.
You're early.
I didn't expect you for hours.
I couldn't live without you for another minute.
Idiot. Anyway, you said 8:30.
I haven't even started yet.
There's a marvelous story in this evening's paper.
- It takes at least one hour.
- Huh?
Your rabbit.
I'm cooking it.
Look. "Bring to the boil. Skim and allow to simmer slowly for one and a half hours."
Yes. Well, we'll eat out tonight.
I'll take you out.
Here. Look. Read that.
Oh, I know that.
I saw it on television.
That bloody bell.
Eels.
Pity it wasn't lobster though.
You never give me a chance to show you what a good cook I am.
Well, you can tell me over dinner.
You'd think they'd have something better to do than clang away like that all the time.
Hmm. It's worse when they start doing it at midnight.
I wonder what they ring it for anyway.
Perhaps they have wild parties.
Maybe they'll invite me sometime.
Go and put your best bib and tucker on.
I feel like a spree.
Ah.
The beautiful younger sister.
Comment ca va?
I thought you were eating in.
Aren't you going to have dinner?
Yes. I'm going to have dinner.
- But not here.
- No.
Not here.
Pass me that brush, will you?
There's a love.
Just because I go out once, there's no need to start sulking.
- I'm not sulking.
- Hmm. Well, you're not exactly smiling.
Come on. You're not going in for the Miss World competition.
Will we go and see the Leaning Tower of Pisa?
I don't think Cinderella likes me.
- Cinderella?
- The little sister.
Ah, don't be silly. 
Well, are we going to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa?
She's a bit strung-up, isn't she?
She's just sensitive. That's all.
You can say that again.
She should see a doctor.
- What do you mean?
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.
- No. You tell me what you meant by that.
- Nothing. Let's forget it.
You want to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa, we'll see the bloody thing. Now let's relax.
We're going to dinner aren't we? 
Don't always change the subject when you start talking like that. You hear? 
Come along, boy. Din-din. 
Time for din-din. 
Come along, boy. Lovely din-din.
Oh, come —  
Oh! 
Mmm. 
I'm sorry.
Oh, look. I've got to run.
I've left something at the flat.
Well, aren't you going to drop me off?
I've got no time.
Mmm. That's bloody hot.
Now you —you'll have to take a cab.
Uh, here.
Oh, here. Are you —
Am I gonna see you tonight?
Um —
I-I'll ring you, hmm?
I'll ring you.
Hello, darling.
How did you sleep?
All right.
Is he going to stay here every night?
I really don't think it's any concern of yours.
He's married though.
Darling, it's my affair.
We all have to lead our own lives in the end, you know.
Well, just don't stand around like that.
Go and answer the phone.
Can't you see I'm busy?
- Hello?
- Miss Ledoux?
Yes.
How much longer are you going to keep me waiting for the rent?
Oh. You want my sister.
- Ah. I suppose she's out.
- No, no. She's here.
Just a moment.
- Who is it?
- The landlord.
Oh, damn. He would ring up today.
- Hello, yes?
- Miss Ledoux?
- Look. I'm terribly sorry —
- I bet you are.
- Now look. How much longer are you going to keep me waiting?
- I promise —
- I've had your promises before.
- I promise you'll have the money tomorrow.
That's what you said a fortnight ago.
You'll have the money tomorrow without fail.
- Look. If you're not going to play fair by —
- My sister will bring it round to you.
- Not you?
- N-No.
I'm going away on holiday.
Now look Miss Ledoux.
This time I've had just about —
She'll bring it round to you tomorrow.
I promise.
She better, Miss Ledoux.
That's all I can say.
Just the sound of his voice makes my flesh creep.
Money, money, money.
That's all he ever thinks about.
Good heavens.
I shall be late again.
- Is Bridget about?
- Oh, she's downstairs.
Oh.
Bridget.
What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- Tell me.
Nothing.
Just bloody men.
Promise you the earth, and then —
- Oh, I could cut my throat.
- Don't talk like that.
I thought this one was different.
- Did he —
- Oh, he was a pig. Forget him.
Oh. Look at my eyes.
Will Miss Bridget please come to the salon. 
Mrs. Prendergast has arrived.
I'll tell you the sordid details later.
Oh, why are they so filthy?
Don't be upset.
Will Miss Bridget please come to the salon right away. 
- Cheerio then.
- See you later.
- You're joking.
- No. You should have seen them.
They went for each other like those women wrestlers in Hamburg.
One, a big lady with bloody great charlies, tried to claw the other girl's face.
Got her fist right down her throat.
Two pints of bitter, please.
- Two pints sir?
- Lesbians?
Now no. They both fancied the same bloke.
I should have his luck. 
And then they started in with their teeth, rolling about on the floor.
It was like a madhouse. 
And I was the only mug who tried to prevent them.
I ought to have my head examined.
I wouldn't have minded seeing it.
Feel free, anytime.
- I ended up —
- Thank you. my coat torn, my shirt covered with blood.
If you like that sort of thing,
I'll introduce you to my cousin.
- She's a black belt.
- Black belt?
How did you get on?
- What?
- What's your cousin like?
- Well, how did you get on with Little Miss Muffet?
- She sounds fun.
- When?
- Well, I thought you were taking her out to dinner.
Your cousin — what's she like?
Is that the right time?
- Now sir.
- Oh, come on. Fill us in with the gripping details.
The gripping details are that she had dinner with her sister.
Well, maybe you should try the sister.
Are you playing hard to get?
I've been waiting over an hour.
Wh — What for?
Well, not for Christmas.
We made a date. Remember?
We're having supper tonight.
Oh, I forgot.
Oh.
Well, next time you forget, maybe you'll let me know.
It's not that but —
Are you all right?
You look —
I don't know.
You look sort of— sort of funny.
I don't feel —
I mean, I don't know.
Oh well, anyway come on. Now I've found you, let's — let's go and eat something.
- I'm starving.
- But it's too late.
Look. Have — 
Have you been fired or something?
All right. Come on.
I'll take you home. Come on.
Listen, Carol. I — I —
- I don't —
- Clumsy bitch!
For heaven's sake.
Carol!
Carol!
Dean doing a little illegal bit outside the ring...
but a neat head butt there by Larsen...
and over to the corner with Ray Hunter coming in.
Finally Rebel Ray Hunter comes in after Stedman the giant.
And Hunter turning Stedman all over the place now but he...
still exchanged places with Larsen.
And Larsen again for Hunter. 
And now it's Hunter in again against Stedman.
Hunter really throwing Stedman around.
I don't know why he goes out.
And it's Larsen in again. Larsen comes in with a twopenny drop. He's gonna need one.
Stedman almost into the ropes there.
Darling.
What is it?
Don't you feel well?
Oh I know you don't want me to go away but —
Hello?
Hello?
But the first point to Hunter and Larsen.
Fourteen and a half minutes gone.
Mmm.
Why'd you throw Michael's things away?
- Why'd you do it?
- I don't like them there.
It's got absolutely nothing to do with you.
You silly little fool.
I've put the money for the rent on the table.
Oh, please. Don't go.
Now please, don't forget to give the money... otherwise we shall both be out onto the street.
- Look. Are you coming or aren't you?
- Yes, yes. I'm coming.
Don't look so sad.
The time will pass very quickly.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Go on.
Oh!
- You're killing me!
- Sorry, Miss Balch.
- There's only —
- Good morning.
Good morning.
There's only one way to deal with men.
That's treat them as though you don't give a damn about them.
I've told you all this before.
Still, I'm glad to see you have listened to me just this once.
There's only one thing they want, and I'll never know... why they make such a fuss about it, but they do.
And the more you make them beg for it, the happier they are.
- He rang me up this morning.
- I said he would.
- He was practically on his knees.
- Well, make sure he stays that way.
I wonder, I don't suppose it would do me any harm if I had a little snack.
Well, what do you fancy?
They're all the same, just like children.
They want to be spanked, then given sweets.
Perhaps a... little Danish pastry.
- Tsk, tsk.
- And a cup of chocolate.
Carol will order it for you.
Carol.
Stop dreaming.
Are you feeling all right, love?
Carol, what's the matter?
There's nothing you'd like to tell me?
I mean, uh —
How do you feel now?
Still biting your nails, eh?
I think you'd better go home. 
Would you like one of the girls to go with you?
Now please. I'll be all right.
Take a taxi anyway.
Uh, ask Millie to give you the money.
Thank you.
Hello? 
Hello?
Hello?
Hello Carol?
It's-It's Colin. H-Hello?
Carol. Carol, it's me.
Carol. Please answer—
I'm running a business here Carol, not a rest home.
You can't just disappear for three days.
Are you sure — 
Well, I mean, you're not in any trouble?
No, I'm not. I'm really —
But surely you could have phoned.
- Well, what is it?
- Mrs. Shaw-Taylor wants to see you.
All right.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Carol I can't help you if you won't tell me what's the matter.
Oh — Well —
Well, one of my aunts came to stay very suddenly.
Oh. I was back at work two days after I had my first baby.
If you're going to vanish every time a relative appears... we might just as well put up the shutters.
I'd better go and see what that old bitch wants.
Now, you go back to your work.
I`ll talk to you later.
And, Carol?
Do something about your hair.
Yes madame.
- Oh my God. Look, look.
- It's nothing.
Out.
I should have your luck, getting off early.
Come on. Cheer up.
Don't look so mis.
You know, you really don't look well.
- Is it a man?
- A man?
Well, I thought that maybe that smooth boy —
What's his name? Was making you unhappy.
You know, the one I've seen you with.
Are you in love with him?
I'm not in love with anyone.
Well, what were you up to for the last three days?
Nothing. I stayed at home.
Oh, well. That's enough to drive anyone up the wall.
You ought to go out, go to a movie or something.
- Oh I'd love to.
- That's it then. Do it.
We saw such a funny Chaplin film at the Classic the other night.
What was it called?
I thought I'd die laughing.
He was so hungry, he wanted to eat his shoe.
- No.
- Yes.
He pretended the laces were spaghetti.
There was this huge great big fat man who wanted to eat him.
- What? Him?
- Yes.
He wanted to eat Charlie Chaplin.
He thought Charlie was a chicken.
- Chicken?
- Yes.
And the chicken walked like Chaplin too.
You know.
Roger laughed so much,
I was quite ashamed of him.
You ought to see it though to cheer you up.
Still keeping her legs crossed?
She's getting you down, you know.
The old, old story —
"Not before we're married, darling."
I wouldn't waste your money.
She seems a dead loss to me.
I mean, don't let her being foreign fool you. 
They're all the same, these bloody virgins —
They're just teasers, that's all.
She seems to have old Colin nicely steamed up though.
She gets a big thrill out of it.
You tell her. She'll soon strip off.
- When I want your advice I'll ask for it.
- Ah.
I do believe the old lad's in love.
- What about that then?
- Another good man gone.
I think your friends are going to have to help you.
Why don't you, um take her over to Reggie's pad one evening? 
Here. Steady on John.
Oh, Reggie will lay something on.
Won't you, Reggie?
Or on something.
I can see the scene now.
Sweet music, soft lights, a big jug of iced gin with um, orange or lemon on top of it.
- Oranges.
- Why, tell her it's a fruit cup... and three of the most eligible bachelors in London.
Here. I`m getting excited already.
By the end of the evening, she'll be begging for it.
- You'll soon be able to stop twitching.
- She'll weep with gratitude.
Yeah. Maybe we will too.
- Maybe you want your face pushed in.
- Here. Take your hands off me.
Colin for heaven's sake.
Relax. Take a joke.
Hit me or something.
Now, look, boy. You've got it bad. Look.
You see?
He's been in the sun too long.
Look, it was only a joke.
There's no need to bloody bust out going on like Cassius Clay all over the place.
- A joke, boy. Joke.
- Fellas, fellas please.
If you go on like this you will be old before your time.
Look relax, take it easy, enjoy life.
Carol?
Carol!
There's somebody there.
I can see your shadow.
What's the matter?
I just want to talk to you that's all.
Carol!
If you don't open the door,
I'll bloody well break it down!
- No!
- What?
I'm sorry.
It's all so sordid.
What's — What's the matter?
I'm sorry. I just —
Well, I had to see you, that's all.
Honestly, it's been so — so miserable without you.
I phoned and phoned.
The ringing tone nearly drove me mad.
Is it, uh — Is it something I've done?
Carol.
Please.
Tell me.
I'm not really like this, you know.
Oh.
I wish I could find the proper words to say.
They just keep going round and round in my head.
I — I just —
I want to be — to be with you.
All the time.
Hello.
You filthy bitch.
I'm sorry. Who is this?
Who is this? Who is this?
Who do you think, you filthy little tart?
You think I don't know he's with you?
You think you're clever, but you're not that clever, you filthy —
Come on! Open up this door.
Come on. Open up.
I know you're in there.
It's no use hiding.
Else I`ll call the police. 
Well!
Where's Miss Ledoux?
I am Miss Ledoux.
You don't look like her.
- I expect you want my sister.
- Expect?
I certainly do.
Where is she?
She's not — 
But I can explain.
Explain?
Well, I doubt that, my dear.
I can see it with my own eyes.
Now then what's the idea of barricading the door against me?
You're not only late with the rent... but you're damaging the property.
I've got the rent here.
Let's have a little light on the subject.
No!
I'm not a bloody owl, you know.
Ah, I thought I'd seen everything. 
This is a flaming nuthouse.
I don't know.
Uh, do you always, uh... run around like, uh, this?
I mean to say, it's a bit, uh —
What's the matter?
You ill?
Ah.
The, uh, heat's getting you down, hmm?
Uh, I don't like it myself.
I'll, uh — I'll get you a — a glass of water.
You're white as a sheet.
Hmm.
What the hell is this?
Oh. No wonder you look ill, if you have things like this hanging around.
It's the dustbin for you my lad.
Good Lord.
Beats me how you young people live in such a mess.
It's like a pigsty. Huh.
Ah.
I know. Ah.
A nice, hot cup of tea might be better, perhaps, hmm?
Of course, um, your sister's gone away, hasn't she?
Yes uh —
A nice, hot cup of tea and , uh — and an aspirin... and you'll be as right as rain.
You must be a bit lonely I expect... now she's gone.
Yes I — I should have guessed it.
All alone by the telephone.
There's uh, no need to be alone, you know.
Huh?
Poor little girl.
All by herself.
All shaking like a little frightened animal.
Oh. Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
They're your family, hmm?
Very nice. Hmm.
Yeah. There's no need to be frightened of me, you know.
Is that you?
Huh?
Where was it taken? 
In uh — In London?
- Brussels.
- Ah.
Ah. Brussels. Hmm.
I could be a very good friend to you, you know.
You... look after me... and you can forget about the rent.
Come on. Come on. Just —
Just a little kiss between friends, huh?
Come on.
You go on up. I'll park the car.
Carol?
Carol! Are you in?
Carol?
I say what`s the matter?
What a terrible smell.
What the hell's going on?
Well, get a grip of yourself, will you?
Now, what's the matter?
Ba — Bathroom.
No! Oh!
Go in there.
Just sit — sit there.
- Have you got a phone?
- Who are you?
I need to phone. I need to phone!
- Want a telephone?
- Yes, a telephone.
Oh.
Everything will be all right.
He's gone to the porter's room to make a telephone call.
She doesn't speak English does she?
Yes, I think she does.
What's the matter? What's happened?
I don't know. We just came in.
Let's see. Oh.
Oh.
Now, you better not touch her.
They've sent —
- I won't forget tonight in a hurry.
- Now come — Now don't touch her.
I'll get her some brandy.
- Has anyone called for an ambulance?
- Yes. He's gone to telephone now.
- Who?
- Man we saw on the stairs.
- Ah.
- Can anyone do artificial respiration?
You shouldn't touch her.
You shouldn't move her.
- Oh, dear.
- I'll get her some brandy.
Somebody must help her.
Please, someone help her.
I wouldn't touch her. Don't touch her.
What's he doing?
- Oh.
- Good Lord.
- Oh, he's gotten her up.
- Please!
He shouldn't touch her.

"Dear Lucia: Now I'm positive that I'm expecting Augusto's child.
That makes me his only real girlfriend."
What nonsense!
"You're just a pastime for him.
Leave him... - for your own good."
What an idiot!
It was Giulia.
I knew it.
Why'd you show it to your mother?
You could have asked me first.
Living with them is bad enough, let alone taking you there.
May I pull out now?
I can't afford a place in town.
It's too expensive.
What's so hard to understand?
Here.
And don't confuse reverse with fourth this time.
Just be quiet and keep an eye out.
I'm quite prepared... to make any sacrifice, but not for a lost cause.
Lucia, please.
Let's not start again.
When your sister writes me a letter like that... -
There's no point harping on it.
When someone threatens me like that, what am I to do?
Get to the point.
What do you want?
I'll see you later.
Cut it out!
She's a poor virgin
come to make her confession
Send her in!
I'll hear her sins
The brakes!
I told you there was gravel on the road.
I've told you a thousand times:
I feed the rabbits.
No need to be so rude.
They're not even yours.
They are too.
Keeping rabbits was my idea.
Go water the flowers.
I'm gonna tell Augusto when he gets back.
Go on and tell, tattle-tale.
- Why didn't you stop?
- Close the door.
- Are you angry?
- What were you doing out there?
Waiting for you.
I like riding with you. Is that a crime?
You shouldn't be out alone.
If something happened, who would help you?
Those two buzzed around me for half an hour.
You're pleased with yourself.
Guess what.
Ale left a poem on my dresser.
A love poem to me.
Did Giulia say anything about me?
You don't really believe her, do you?
What did you say?
Everyone says I'm a beauty
I am the queen of love
Everyone says I'm a star
Shining in splendor above
Be a good boy, Leone.
Try to remember.
What sound do horses make?
- I don't know.
Of course you do.
Come on.
What about donkeys?
Dinner's ready.
They bray.
And oxen?
Augusto's here, Mama.
May the Lord bless this food and keep us in his holy ways.
- One or two?
- Two.
Stop that!
Eat properly!
Nervous, eh?
Just a bit on edge.
Stop it.
Let go.
Stop it!
Ale, could you cut my meat?
Take it.
- Cards?
- I don't feel like it.
Come into the den.
Would you like to read the poem?
I wrote this for your own good.
I don't want anything bad to happen to you.
I've told you a thousand times:
I just want to be left alone.
Is that asking too much?
Keep your emotional outbursts to yourselves and let me work.
Keep your nose out of my business.
Understand?
Yes, I understand.
Sure you do.
I don't want to hear another word about Ale's poetry.
Now get going.
I said get out.
- What did you tell him?
- Everything. You'll see.
That was stupid.
Why is it, at your age, that you have no ambition?
Nice clothes or a little pocket money... - those would be modest ambitions, but better than nothing.
Stop spying on each other, reading each other's diary.
Why don't you try and learn something?
You can't even type.
You haven't touched the bicycle I bought you.
Just go away.
It's pointless trying to talk to you.
All you've managed to do is take off Leone's bandage when the doctor said not to.
Why did you take it off?
You're like a bunch of animals!
Watch out,
'cause someday I'll get fed up.
And I've told you before:
Don't wear my shirts!
- So you showed him my poem.
- Yes. What about it?
Your phone was busy for half an hour.
Who was it?
Jealous?
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm really down.
Try to understand.
I'm sorry about earlier.
Is that the TVin the background?
Do you love me?
Why don't we get together now?
I'll come over.
No, I'm not crazy.
I can be there in half an hour.
Wait for me. Bye.
Hey, it's 11:00.
My lesson.
My father sent along some apples for you.
It's 11:00.
My lesson.
- Put them down.
Turn off that record!
Get my slippers.
The window.
Did you get your report card?
And?
- I flunked.
Cretin! Imbecile!
Beast! Ass! Idiot!
This is what I get for trying to pound some knowledge into that thick head?
Go and dig the fields.
"O sun, you who rise joyful and free, tame your horses upon our hills."
Let's see this report card.
You gotta change these grades.
But it must be done very carefully.
No fancy stuff.
It takes a very light touch.
Give me a pen.
Meanwhile, here's an assignment for you.
A nice little composition entitled
"What I see on the terrace."
Go out on the terrace, have a look, come back, and tell me exactly what you saw.
All right? Now go.
Look. I changed your grade in math and art.
See anything interesting?
On the terrace your sister, Miss Giulia, was sunbathing.
Very good.
Let's explore this subject for a while.
Describe Miss Giulia.
On the terrace, Miss Giulia was sunbathing on the terrace.
Try to be more specific.
Can you remember, for instance, what position she was in?
I believe she was sitting down.
You remember how she was dressed?
No, I don't.
You're going to go back out there.
This time get as close as possible and observe carefully.
Then come back and tell me everything you saw.
Meanwhile,
I'll finish your report card.
All right.
Did you get up close?
Well?
Congratulations.
I hope you're proud of yourself.
The ink bottle.
Pour it.
Pour.
What are you doing?
You idiot.
What's wrong with you?
What do I do now?
"What do I do now?"
"You made your bed.
Now lie in it."
"As you sow, so shall you reap."
Did you study when I begged and entreated you, when I went hoarse trying to teach you?
Dig deep into your conscience and see who's to blame.
You got what you deserved.
Good-bye.
Every Sunday when I went
To church, my prayers to say
A youth of heavenly beauty
Sandrino.
Would you read me the newspaper?
Where is it?
Don't you see it?
Look around.
It has to be here.
Do you mind?
- No, Mama. Why should I mind?
What?
Are you talking to yourself?
I feel a draft.
Is the window open?
It's closed.
I found the newspaper.
What should I read?
Would you be so kind as to read me who died?
Who died.
Let's see.
Zerpani, Luisa.
Cavalli, Giambattista.
Paracioppi, Gustavo.
Saraceno, Elisabetta.
Anyone you know?
No, no one.
And births?
No births, no weddings, no graduations.
What else should I read?
Anything.
But what?
I can't read the whole paper.
I'll read some headlines and you stop me.
"Signalman crushed by moving train.
Was he drunk?
Impossible to determine for certain."
How sad.
Premeditated matricide.
Son kills mother for making him take a bath.
Good grief.
Retired married couple commit suicide by turning on the oven.
He was 68.
She was 53.
Same age as me.
What an awful day.
Isn't there any happier news?
The king of England died, leaving in the darkest despair and desperation... -
- But there's the queen.
- Precisely.
As always.
I'm so unhappy.
What's wrong?
Would you like some candy?
Open up!
Open up!
Learn some manners.
Just a minute.
Quick!
Put a handkerchief between his teeth or he'll bite his tongue.
Hurry up, you idiot!
- How?
You're suffocating him!
Let me do it!
I'll call the doctor.
The doctor was out.
Let's put him on the table.
Give me a hand.
Gently.
Laugh.
That'll make him furious.
Are you done?
Can't I talk to Augusto?
That's enough.
I said that's enough!
Come here!
Let me go!
Get out of here!
I've had it with you two!
Look what you did to my face!
She's hitting me!
Get out of here!
I can't take much more of this.
Stop butting in!
Sandro, what's wrong?
Did you hurt yourself?
Mr. Sandro, what happened to your face?
My face! My face!
My God!
Where's Ale?
Just look at him.
Staring in the mirror instead of cooling off his head.
Shame on you.
There.
Stay down there.
It'll do you good.
I can't breathe!
Just try to imagine if you were on your own... without the four of us.
For the first time in your life, you could think of yourself.
Tell me man to man:
Why should you let us poison your whole life?
And I'm including myself.
I really care for you, Augusto.
You're the only one I care for.
That's why I want you to be free.
And I think I just came up with a way.
Want some milk?
Look at this.
Can I get my driver's license?
Are you crazy?
They'd never allow it.
Have you lost your mind?
I haven't had an attack in a year.
I've been fine since I started taking my pills regularly.
I'm in full control.
Some control.
Just last month you... -
I was faking. I swear.
So I wouldn't have to go into town with Leone.
Great.
I should have known.
What's past is past.
I'll get right to the point.
Every year on All Souls' Day, we've all gone to the cemetery.
And you've driven us there.
This year I'll drive.
You really think
I'd be that irresponsible?
- Exactly.
- Exactly what? Explain yourself.
At the Barberino curve,
I'll drive us all off the cliff.
What's so funny?
Don't tell me you never thought about it.
Hi, Augusto.
How are you?
Everything all right?
What's your hurry?
- The usual place?
- Where else?
- Sorry I'm late.
- What happened?
Something came up at the last minute.
You forgot to signal.
I'm sorry.
Otherwise you did well.
Don't take it too hard.
A month will fly by.
- Let's go.
- All right.
I lied this morning.
The test was today, and I passed.
Congratulations.
If I'd told you in advance,
I'd have felt like you were there, and the responsibility would have weighed on me, with all the money you've spent.
May I ask a favor?
- Go ahead.
You're supposed to drive us to the cemetery today.
You do it for Mama's sake, but I know it's a bother.
I could drive them and give you the afternoon free.
You know how to back up?
Of course.
- Can you change a tire?
- I'll show you.
No, I believe you.
Very well.
But drive slowly.
- Please close the door.
- I'm coming right back.
Hello, boys.
Sandro, please close the door.
Mama, Sandro passed his driving test.
- Really? When?
- This morning.
He must be so happy.
I kept praying he'd just give up on the idea.
Hey there.
- Sorry.
- I have to get by.
Here are some towels.
Did you really pass your driving test?
I don't believe it.
- Sorry I'm late.
- I hear you did very well.
I'm happy.
Congratulations, Ale.
Let's eat.
Ale asked me if he could drive you all to the cemetery.
I trust him, and it's a chance for him to make himself useful.
And I could take care of some other things.
You're not going?
You always drive, and today suddenly Ale's driving.
I'm supposed to trust Ale.
Unless you drive, I'm not budging.
- He knows how to drive.
- I don't care. I'm staying home.
All right, Ale.
You'll take Leone and Mama.
If Giulia won't go, it's her loss.
I'll take them, but they all have to come.
Including Giulia.
- But how?
- You can persuade her.
She likes you and does whatever you ask.
She has to come along, like it or not.
I assure you:
You won't be sorry this time.
Why?
It's a surprise.
Dear Augusto,
you've always underestimated me.
But this time
I'll keep my promise.
Everyone ready?
Don't do anything stupid.
Comfortable?
Be careful, you hear?
Remember your signals and handbrake, and drive slowly.
I left a note on the table.
Read it when you have time.
What about?
Just things.
I'll get rid of everyone
for you today, including myself.
I failed the driving test.
I had to lie to get the car.
From one man to another:
good-bye.
I'd like to be cremated.
Come on!
Watch out!
Go!
- Ale, I'm afraid!
- Go!
I'm afraid!
Slow down, please!
Come on, you can do it!
I forgot.
That car made me lose my head.
This is a good spot, but I wasn't prepared.
Did you say something?
Mama wants to know why we stopped.
We stopped because we stopped, all right?
Hey there. How are you?
- Coming in?
- What for?
We forgot water
for the flowers.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
I'm falling!
Let's all say a requiem together.
- Why don't you want to?
- Because I don't.
- Yes!
- No!
- At least take off your sweater.
- And then?
You always end up taking it off.
Why make me ask for half an hour?
I end up begging, like you're doing me a favor.
Where are you going?
Stay here.
I don't know why you get so offended.
All right. I'm sorry.
It's been one of those days.
Read this and tell me if I'm not entitled.
And you just sit there?
Do something.
- You don't really think he'd do it!
Wait for me, Ale.
Where are you going?
Wait for me.
When you raced with that car,
I wasn't afraid at all.
You were a maniac.
I felt like I was driving too.
I really wanted you to pass him.
Why did you stop?
What's wrong?
Are you sick?
Is it an attack?
It's just one of those days.
I made my mind up about a lot of things, but then I changed my mind and went back on my decisions.
But now, come hell or high water,
I'm absolutely determined.
Please, Augusto.
You want me to sit down?
Is that better now?
Why so afraid? Whatever was gonna happen has already happened.
What's this nonsense?
I was just joking.
They could be back any minute.
We'll hear the car.
Are you crazy?
I don't like this.
What don't you like?
I don't know. The way you're talking.
My mind is racing.
Are you imagining the same thing I am?
Come on, tell the truth.
That must be them.
Get off the bed.
I'm glad they're back.
I was starting to think... -
If they hadn't returned, would you feel responsible?
Responsible for what?
Let's get things straight here.
Then why did you let yourself go?
Let myself go?
You obviously don't know me very well.
You were dreaming, just like I was.
The lights, Leone.
- Are you crazy?
- Look what he writes!
"I'd like to be cremated."
You little jerk!
Aren't you ashamed to show your face?
Stop laughing and get up!
Are you sick or what?
- Hey.
- What?
You knew this and still allowed me to go?
Stop laughing.
You'll make him mad.
- That's the surprise you promised me?
- What surprise?
Idiot!
What torture, living in this house.
All by yourself, just like that, you decided for all of us?
That was a narrow escape.
That's why you wanted me along too.
You didn't do it, but to think you could even conceive of it!
Giulia, listen.
Out of my way.
'Raus!
Come on.
- Someone's coming.
- Don Luigi?
Of course not.
Don't you hear it?
Yes, I know him.
- You do?
- It's Sandro, from the villa.
- They're all crazy out there.
- Quiet, idiot! He'll hear you.
You're the idiot.
What do we do now?
Come on, let's go.
"Condemned to spend your youthful years in this uncivilized hamlet."
How much do I need to raise them professionally?
I can help you raise them, but I've got no money.
How much would it take?
At least three or four million.
You have that much?
I'll stop by tomorrow evening and let you know.
All right.
All right, but why breeding?
You even forget to feed your four rabbits.
Why don't you learn to make business cards instead?
I saw it in today's paper.
Ten lire per card for drawing one flower.
Some people earn
10,000 lire a day.
Your enterprise would mean taking on debt, which I have no desire to do.
Mama alone costs three million a year.
Between you and me, if we didn't have her... -
But we do, and I just couldn't put her in a home.
We don't get public assistance, you know.
Are you ready?
Did you make a shopping list?
- It's in my bag.
Let's go, then.
- Augusto's here too.
- Don't look at him.
Stop looking.
- You know the others?
- Probably his friends.
Stop it.
Is Lucia there too?
- What if she is?
- Why are they laughing?
That's their business.
What will you have?
- Yes?
- A vermouth.
- Red or dry?
- What?
- Red or dry?
- Dry.
Ma'am?
Two dry vermouths.
Don't wait for me.
I'm getting a ride.
Did you get everything?
- Yes, we're all done.
- You need gas?
- No, we've got plenty.
All right. Tell Mama
I'll be home for supper.
And drive slowly, please.
I'm coming.
I suddenly feel hot.
I'll ride with Sandra.
You go ahead.
Let's go.
Lucia wouldn't tell us who you were talking to.
To the right!
Look at that fat one!
To the right!
Come on.
I'm going to the bathroom.
You can take your time.
Ready?
Did you make up your mind?
He looked.
I knew it.
I win.
That's enough sugar, Leone.
How did you think of that?
You're the one who said he was better.
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I know, and that's enough.
What are you going to do?
- I guess I'll take a bath.
Is that you, Ale?
Sorry, Mama.
It slipped my mind.
Have you been waiting long?
If you're busy, we can go another day.
Why would I be busy?
Want to come to the cemetery?
No. See you tonight.
Enjoy your bath.
I'm so sorry I kept you waiting.
- It doesn't matter.
You'll see.
We'll be back in no time.
Put me in the front seat.
And please don't upset me.
Let me enjoy the ride.
Have you got the money or not?
We'll talk about it tomorrow, okay?
All right, but stay in touch, okay?
All set?
Thanks, and have a good drive.
- Who was that?
- Tonino.
What did he want?
Nothing.
Ale, please open the window a little.
Of course. You get carsick.
I'm sorry.
Should we stop a while?
It's no problem.
Yes, maybe we should.
I can get some fresh air.
- Of course.
We have all the time in the world.
- Where are we?
- San Salvatore.
Don't get too close.
It's dangerous.
I'm sorry, but you'd better guide me.
Please, where can I sit down?
Come and sit on the wall.
Go ahead.
You can do it.
Ale, help me.
Where did you go?
- Keep going.
- Where are you?
Where's the wall? Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Ale, please help me.
Please, Ale, help me.
Help me sit down.
Blessed mother, pray for her...
Park over there.
"Knock and it shall be opened unto you."
- What are these?
- Mourning cards.
You have to choose one.
- You decide.
This house was never as lively as it is now... - for a funeral.
Many happy returns.
- Come on, Sandro.
Lucia really knows her way around a kitchen.
She makes great coffee.
How can you talk about coffee now?
I was just paying Lucia a compliment.
Why don't you go sit with Mama?
Giulia must be tired.
I'm on my way.
Tonight we could leave her alone.
She's not going anywhere.
We'll see. Now go.
- Coffee's ready.
- I'll take it.
Would you care for coffee?
Take one.
Go ahead.
Forgive me, but are you in or out?
Let's discuss it another time.
With chinchillas, if we wait, we'll lose the first litter.
Then let's forget it.
I don't know. I'm all confused.
I can't think straight.
Is it the money, or have you lost interest?
Tonino, even you must see this isn't the proper time.
My mother... -
- Forget I mentioned it.
Leone, go on.
I'll stay here.
Let me help you.
Everything will be all right.
Are you crazy?
Ah, Leone.
Come in.
Don't be afraid.
Do you need something?
Want some coffee?
Lucia, make him some coffee.
Say something, for God's sake.
Want me to dry?
What is it?
If you want to go, I'll stay.
How do you feel?
How do you think I feel?
Excuse me, Sisters, but this is our last chance to be alone with our poor mother.
Why did you send them away?
Because.
You always want to look important.
Are you sorry Mama's dead?
What a question.
Well, are you all right, or aren't you?
I'm restless, all mixed up, full of ideas.
Aren't you?
Certainly. It's a great opportunity, and everyone wants to take advantage.
Did you see how helpful
Augusto was being?
What's on your mind?
Do you even have to ask?
I'm a volcano of ideas.
Are you crazy?
I'll bet Augusto thinks he can get married now and move into town.
Too bad he'll have to stay here.
Please, Ale.
Come back down to earth.
He's the one who gives orders here.
True.
But I'm no longer under his spell.
Can't I say so?
You can say what you like, for all I care.
The way he was bossing
Lucia around today... as if we were all half-wits.
- What good is talking about it?
- Doesn't it hurt?
What good is talking about it?
Can't you see he's taking advantage of Mama's death?
- And why shouldn't he?
- Why shouldn't he?
Whoever has a plan will take advantage.
You have no plans, so you'll just look on.
He'll profit from this because he's the only one who wants something.
- Let's get something straight here.
- By all means.
Go ahead and snicker.
You think Mama died by accident?
I killed her.
With these hands, despite my fears.
I risk life imprisonment for the family's benefit, while he, like a thief, suddenly becomes "big brother."
He brings in Lucia and has her serve coffee, and he'll walk off with the fortune I made!
This little brain of mine... that you didn't trust an inch planned the whole thing.
My head!
Giulia, hold my head!
I'll come around.
Quiet or they'll hear us.
That's a good boy.
Go away.
Lean on me.
Come lie down on the bed.
Are you going to tell?
Are you going to tell?
Tell me how it happened.
Be a good boy
and keep your voice down,
or the devil
will come and get you.
If you wish to say a last farewell to your poor mother, do so before we close the lid on this gentlest and most grief-stricken of mothers.
No one's closer to us than our mother.
"No one can take the place of a mother," says an old proverb.
This woman, destined by divine providence to have her faith and Christian patience tried by lifelong misfortune... - at least now she can look down upon you from above.
I wouldn't have
the courage to kiss her.
Unfortunately, nature makes exceptions for nobody.
Yet "divine patience is omnipotent."
But that's another sermon.
A fur coat.
Look, Mama's fur coat.
There's nobody here anymore who's blind!
Where should we put it?
That's the first and last time you sleep outside.
And in a stable!
That's not even proper.
Why don't we move away?
What a brilliant idea.
There's something
I have to tell you.
Here we go.
Just a second.
I would save these magazines.
This collection might be valuable.
What do you want to do with Mama's room?
Let's hear it.
It's just that I'm getting married, and it seemed advisable... - or rather, necessary... - that I tell you.
Giulia, come sit here so he only has to look in one place.
If that's all, it's fine with me.
And I'm sure
Giulia would have no... -
Although I hardly know Lucia, we'll all get along well together.
Perhaps you didn't understand.
I meant we're planning to get an apartment in town.
I'll split my time between here and there.
Monday, Wednesday and Saturday in town, and the rest here.
Even a small apartment costs money.
This is a bit awkward, but Mama's death eliminates certain expenses.
Exactly... - the three million you promised me.
I assumed you'd forgotten about that.
How would you use it?
- I'll tell you.
When?
Tomorrow.
Remember Uncle Giuseppino?
Here we go!
Ale, be careful!
How am I doing so far?
Fine.
I'm just afraid that sooner or later you're going to tell him, simply out of vanity.
Certainly I'll tell him.
Problem is, I've lost the desire to raise chinchillas.
I'm bursting with energy.
I have to channel it into something.
We have lots of work ahead.
We'll empty the attic, clean the house. We'll be busy.
But for how long?
I loved the chinchillas.
I swear.
I'd dream about them at night.
You missed me.
Some of this stuff is still good.
They're burning everything.
If it weren't for me... -
Mama's glasses are all charred.
Look at this thing.
The pot we cooked eggs in.
This is burning hot.
Enough!
What's wrong with you?
You got the devil inside you?
- Am I a good lover?
- You'll learn.
We said 3,000.
I'm putting it here on the table, okay?
Have you known Augusto long?
Years.
- Is he good?
- Certainly better than you.
No doubt.
He's been doing it for years.
Does he visit you often?
- Three or four times a month.
In this bed?
What is this, an inquisition?
Come on.
This bed or another one... - whatever's available.
- How many years?
- I already told you. Weren't you listening?
Here we go again.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
Where have you been for half an hour?
With a whore.
She's coming up ahead.
There.
- Which one?
There.
- The one in red?
- Yes. Did you get a good look?
You went with her?
To bed?
Go back around.
I want a better look.
The train!
- Here we are.
- Go slow.
Take a good look.
I'm not circling back again.
You recognize her?
Not bad, is she?
What do you think?
Will you go back again?
Why wasn't I invited?
Sandro didn't want it.
Ask him.
- Why wasn't I invited?
- Who told you?
He's lying.
How do I look?
So you're going?
I'll tell you about it afterwards.
I wasn't invited.
Neither was I.
Giulia, watch Leone.
Call me if anything happens.
What could happen?
Leone, do something.
Can't you see they're leaving?
Sandro, I beg you, don't do anything silly, and remember to wish Lucia a happy birthday.
Remember your manners.
Hi, how are you?
Good evening.
And above all, no drinking.
Is that clear?
- How do I look?
- Fine.
- Look my way occasionally.
- Of course.
Couldn't you go around the other way?
This is Alessandro.
Happy birthday.
Don't we look nice tonight.
So chic.
What a crowd.
I hardly know anyone.
I'll introduce you around.
Hey there.
Look, there's Sandro.
Got a cigarette?
Where did we leave off?
Ah, right... - at Hobbes's theory:
Homo homini lupus, which means that man acts like a wolf towards other men.
And what about women?
You disappoint me.
Can you really be that narrow-minded?
Women are incidental in philosophy.
Remember what Thomas Aquinas said in his Summa Theologica.
Are you new here?
Yes. I'm Augusto's brother.
Ah, Lucia's fiancé?
What do you do?
It's a bit unusual.
Come and sit here.
Are you always alone like this?
Shall we dance?
I don't really feel like it.
- Shall we dance?
- I don't know how.
- I'll teach you.
- Fine, if you'll teach me.
Come on, then.
- How do you do it?
- Like this.
- Where are you going?
- We have to talk.
- Is this wood?
- I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
Do you like my friends?
Yes. They're friendly people that you can talk to.
Would you like to live in town?
Sure. It's a lot of fun here.
But I'd need something to do.
I'm not against your marriage, even if Augusto thinks I am.
We all have our own lives.
It's just that, financially speaking... -
- Here you are.
- We were talking about you.
Somebody's looking for you.
- How's it going?
- Fine.
Great. Enjoy yourself.
I had no luck.
But she'd go with you. Honest.
She keeps asking for you.
I like how you said,
"I can't dance. All right, teach me."
There she is. See ya.
- No, don't go.
- Why?
- Stay here.
- See ya.
Shall we dance?
My brother's waiting for me.
I should go.
Give me your telephone number.
No, but you can always find me on the main boulevard.
See you around.
Wait... -
The car isn't ready.
- Want more coffee?
- No, it doesn't matter.
- Take mine.
- No, thanks.
- I'll leave some.
- Fine.
And now let's go paint.
What's wrong, Ale?
Are you angry about the car?
It's annoying.
I shaved for nothing.
- You can go into town tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.
I'll have to shave again.
You know how hard it is.
Won't you come paint?
You go.
I'll come later.
I need to take a walk by myself.
I could tell.
May I come in?
Get out of there.
What are you doing?
Come out here.
What are you doing?
Let me give you a buggy ride.
Here he comes!
Where were you?
I was where I was.
What's wrong?
I feel depressed and useless.
You can't be depressed just 'cause you shaved.
Apparently I can.
How can I tire myself out?
The thought of painting is too depressing today.
Stop it, Leone!
You're messing up the floor!
Leone needs a bath.
I'll get it ready for him.
I'll go if you want.
Finish up here before I get back.
We should call it a day.
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
I'm glad.
Take off your shoes.
Now, Leone, while I prepare your bath, you go get a big towel, some underwear, some socks and an undershirt.
Leave your shoes in the kitchen and put on your slippers.
Get your bottle of yellow pills and a glass.
Go on now.
Now get undressed.
How many do you take?
- One.
Drink this.
Better not lock the door.
If anything happened, who would help you?
Go.
Five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten.
What's wrong?
What is it, Ale?
We forgot all about Leone.
You gonna spend your whole life in the tub?
What's wrong?
Did you fall asleep?
What's wrong?
What should we do now?
Just wait.
Her condition is stable for now.
Stable?
That's all you can say?
Just wait and hope things turn out well.
But you must have some prognosis.
Sandro, I'm not a magician.
But you must have an opinion... - either there's hope or there isn't.
You have to tell me something.
She could live or die or end up paralyzed.
Hear that?
Be quiet!
Get out of here!
I told you he'd get mad.
But what are her chances?
Can't you tell me that?
- It wouldn't change anything.
- It would for me!
What should we do?
You're breathing.
You're alive.
Just when things were starting to work out.
When we might have started inviting people.
Giulia may live or die or be paralyzed and a burden to us for 30 years.
Right back where we started.
You're right to want to leave, to sell this place.
Giulia's awake and asking for you.
Giulia, can you hear me?
Are you alive?
Can you feel your legs?
How about your arms?
Everything's working.
- Stop it.
What's wrong?
We can pick up where we left off, just like before.
You know Leone's dead, right?
Aren't you glad?
You're crying? Why?
- Because you don't love me.
- I don't?
But I do.
- Sorry. The door was open.
- Come in.
Have you seen how neat everything is?
Lucia's marvelous.
Yes, she's very efficient.
A real dynamo.
Thank you for being so understanding about me and Lucia.
Listen, Augusto.
It's time we spoke frankly.
- Can you believe it?
- What?
My wife and kids are supposed to live here?
I knew you'd say that.
He's thought of every angle.
You understand?
- What angles?
He'll leave you and Lucia alone because he can't get along without you.
I'll turn him in.
Let me finish.
Relax.
If anyone should be afraid here, it's me.
- What are you saying?
- It's true. I know him.
Besides, if you turned him in, they wouldn't believe you.
There's no evidence.
And you won't get a word out of me.
For him to dream, to get excited, he needs active people around him, people who don't need help.
Above all, they mustn't be incurables.
Let's stick together.
You and me.
- Of course.
Don't be afraid.
Just do what you've always done.
It'll be all right.
I'm leaving.
Okay. See you.
See you.
If you need anything, just tell me.
Giulia, are you asleep?
Sleep well.
Everything's working out for the best.
Sleep, sleep.
And tomorrow... -
Help me!
Help me!
Giulia, hold my head!
Are you a doctor?
Yes. Yes.
He's an actor.
Oh, an actor.
We're very popular with actors.
Have l, uh, seen you in anything?
Let's see. I did Hamlet a while back, didn't l, Liz?
And then we did, the, uh,
The Sand piper.
He's joking.
He was in Luther and Nobody Loves An Albatross and a lot of television plays and commercials.
Well, that's where the money is, isn't it? Commercials.
And the artistic thrills, too.
7, Diego.
Originally, the smallest apartment was in 9.
They've been broken up into four, fives, and sixes.
Now, 7-E is a four, originally the back part of a 10.
It has the original dining room for its living room, another bedroom for the bedroom, and two servants' rooms thrown together for a dining room or a second bedroom.
Do you have children?
Uh, we plan to.
We must oil that gate,
Diego.
This way, please.
The previous tenant,
Mrs. Gardenia, passed away just a few days ago, so nothing has been moved yet.
Her son asked me to say that some of the furniture could be picked up practically for the asking.
Did she die in the apartment?
Not that it makes any difference.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
In a hospital.
She'd been in a coma for weeks.
After you, please.
Thank you.
She was very old and passed away without ever waking.
I'd be grateful to go that way myself when the time comes.
Oh, no, no, no, not in the apartment, no.
She was chipper right to the end,
Been one of the first women lawyers in New York state.
Did a little gardening on the side, too.
She was quite a woman.
Oh, closet.
Oh, plenty of closets.
Oh, nice view of the park.
Oh, very nice view.
"I can no longer associate myself"
Now, this room, for instance, it would make a lovely nursery.
Yes. Yellow and white wallpaper would brighten it tremendously.
What are all these things here?
Herbs, mostly.
A nice large bathroom.
Mmm. Mint, basil.
Yeah. No marijuana?
The, uh, master bedroom.
Oh, yes.
Here we are, back at the hallway again.
There.
Oh...
Oh, Guy!
Yeah.
Ohh!
The fireplace works,
Of course.
Great.
Oh!
Oh, it's a wonderful apartment.
I love it!
See what she's trying to do?
She's trying to get you to lower the rent, see?
Yes. Well, we'd raise it if we were allowed.
Apartments with this kind of charm--
Why, that's odd.
There's a closet behind that secretary.
I'm su--
I'm sure there is.
Yeah. Oh, I think you're right.
She moved it.
It used to be there.
Give me a hand, will you?
I see now why she went into a coma!
She couldn't have lifted it by herself.
She was 89!
Should we open it?
Maybe her son should.
I'm authorized to show the apartment.
Well!
Whatever she locked in got out.
Well, perhaps she didn't need five closets.
Why would she cover up her vacuum cleaner and her towels?
I don't suppose we'll ever know.
Maybe she was becoming senile after all.
Is there anything else?
Yes, please.
What about the laundry facilities?
It's bigger than the other one.
Yeah. It's more expensive, too, you know?
It's better located.
Yeah, well, God knows,
I could walk to all the theaters from here.
Oh, Guy, let's take it, please?
That living room could be--
Oh, please, let's take it.
O.K., darling, we get out of the other lease, O.K.
I was tempted to write the management that you were drug addicts and litterbugs.
Instead, I decided to lie and tell them you were wonderful tenants.
Oh, you're great, Hutch.
Wish I could talk you out of it, though.
He's pulling your leg, Ro, honey.
Indeed I'm not.
Now, that looks great.
That is--
Are you aware that the Bramford had rather an unpleasant reputation around the turn of the century?
It's where the Trench sisters conducted their little dietary experiments, and Keith Kennedy held his parties.
Adrian Marcato lived there, too.
So did Pearl Ames.
- Who was Adrian Marcato?
- Who were the Trench sisters?
The Trench sisters were two proper
Victorian ladies.
They cooked and ate several young children, including a niece.
Oh, lovely.
Adrian Marcato practiced witchcraft.
He made quite a splash in the nineties by announcing that he'd conjured up the living devil.
Apparently, people believed him, so they attacked and nearly killed him in the lobby of the Bramford.
You're joking?
Later, the Keith Kennedy business began, and by the twenties, the house was half empty.
I knew about
Keith Kennedy.
I didn't know that Marcato lived there.
And those sisters.
World War Il filled the house up again.
Terrific.
What? The house?
The lamb.
Oh.
They called it
Black Bramford.
But, Hutch, awful things happen in every apartment house.
Ah, but this house has a high incidence of unpleasant happenings.
In '59, a dead infant was found, wrapped in newspaper in the basement.
Mmm! You really rouse my appetite.
Have some more wine.
Roman!
Bring me in some root beer when you come!
Hey, these are shelves.
Hey...
Iet's make love.
Shh!
I think I hear the Trench sisters chewing.
Oh!
Straight up to the left.
Here in Daytona, Florida, it's the 250-CC
100-Mile Classic with Yamaha leading the pack on the final lap... and winning it, as Yamaha takes 7 of the top 10 places.
It's the third straight year for Yamaha, a clean sweep.
Yamaha is race bred from champions, and, as you can see, we have a model for every kind of riding.
You know,you really should
Discover the swingin' world of Yamaha.
Why don't you get on, have a ride?
Come on. Get on.
O.K., come on.
Let'sgo.
Look.
It's great.
I'm sorry. I thought you were Victoria Vetri, the actress.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
A lot of people think I'm Victoria.
I don't see any resemblance.
Do you know her?
No.
My name's
Terry Gionoffrio.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.
Uh, we--we're new tenants here.
I'm staying with the Castavets, seventh floor.
I'm their guest, sort of,
Since June.
Our apartment used to be the back part of yours.
Oh, for goodness sakes.
You took the old lady's apartment.
Mrs., uh...
Yeah, um, Miss, uh...
Gard--Gardenia.
Gardenia. Yeah.
She was a good friend of the Castavets.
She used to grow all kinds of herbs and things for her to cook with.
I saw those plants.
Yeah. Well, now, she grows her own things.
Excuse me a moment.
I have to put the softener in.
What does your husband do?
He's an actor.
No kidding?
What's his name?
Guy Woodhouse.
He was in Luther and Nobody Loves an Albatross, and he does a lot of television and radio.
Gee, I watch TV all day long.
I bet I've seen him.
Wow!
Ooh!
I hate this basement.
Yeah, me, too.
It gives me the creeps.
Listen, why don't we come down here regular together and do our laundry?
O.K., that would be great.
I have a good luck charm.
It might work for both of us.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Isn't it?
Mrs. Castavet gave it to me.
It's good luck.
Anyway, it's supposed to be.
It's got some stuff inside.
I'm not mad about the smell either.
I hope it works.
It's a beautiful charm, though.
I've never seen anything like it.
European.
The Castavets are the most wonderful people in the world, bar none.
You know, they picked me up
Off the sidewalk, literally?
You were sick?
I was starving and on dope and doing a lot of other things.
They're childless, though.
I'm like the daughter they never had.
At first, I thought they wanted me for some kind of sex thing, but they've turned out to be like real grandparents.
It's nice to know there are people like that when you hear so much about apathy and people who are afraid of getting involved.
I'd be dead now if it wasn't for them.
That's an absolute fact, dead or in jail.
You don't have any family that could have helped you?
A brother in the Navy.
Why, it's impossible to be 100% sure!
If you want my opinion, we shouldn't tell her at all!
That's my opinion!
That must be the partition.
That's the back part of the original 10 with a dining room, and there's-- there's a closet over here, and then there's a closet over here.
Stay back, huh, lady?
Get back now, will you, please?
Get back.
There's nothing to see.
Get back, will you, please?
Jesus.
Get back!
We know her.
What's her name?
Terry.
Terry what?
Ro?
What was her name again?
Terry what?
I don't remember.
An ltalian name.
She was staying with some people named Castavet,
7-E.
Yeah. We got that already.
Short and sweet.
She stuck it to the window sill with a band-aid.
Come on. Get back.
Theresa Gionoffrio.
Move on!
Move on!
You knew her?
Only slightly.
Come on, Ro baby.
Let's go.
Oh! Here they come.
You folks the Castavets on the seventh floor?
We are.
You have a young woman named
Theresa Gionoffrio living with you?
We do. What's wrong?
Has there been an accident?
You'd better brace yourself for some bad news.
She's dead.
Jumped out of the window.
That's not possible!
It's a mistake!
Artie, you want to let these folks take a look, please?
I knew this would happen.
She got deeply depressed every three weeks or so.
I told my wife about it, but she pooh-poohed me.
Well, that--that doesn't mean she killed herself.
She was a very happy girl with no reason for self-destruction.
She must have been cleaning the windows or something.
She wasn't cleaning windows at midnight.
Why not? Maybe she was!
Is that her handwriting?
Yeah.
Definitely.
Absolutely.
Thank you.
I'll see this gets back to you when we're done with it.
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.
She was so happy.
Who's the next-of-kin?
She's all alone.
She didn't have anybody, only us.
Didn't she have a brother?
Did she?
She said she did.
In the Navy.
News to me.
Do you know where he's stationed?
No, I don't.
She mentioned him to me in the laundry room.
I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.
Uh, we're in, uh, 7-E.
I feel just the way you do,
Mrs. Castavet.
She seemed so happy and full of--
She said wonderful things about you and your husband, how grateful she was.
Thank you.
You know anything else about this brother except he's in the Navy?
No, I don't.
It should be easy to find him.
I'm so stunned.
I'm so sorry.
It's such a pity.
Well, thank you.
Sometimes I wonder how come you're the leader of anything.
Please don't tell me what Laura-Louise said because I'm not interested.
If you'd listened to me, we wouldn't have had to do this!
We'd have been all set to go now instead of having to start all over from scratch!
I told you not to tell her in advance!
I told you she wouldn't be open-minded!
I told Sister Veronica about the windows, and she withdrew the school from the competition.
Otherwise, we would--
Hello. How are you?
Fine. May I come in a minute?
Yes, of course. Please do.
I just come over to thank you for saying those nice things to us the other night.
Oh, no, please.
There's--
Poor Terry. We thought maybe we'd failed her some way, although her note made it crystal clear we hadn't.
You'll never know how helpful it was in such a shock moment.
So I do thank you.
Roman does, too.
Roman's my hubby.
You're welcome.
I'm glad I could help.
Yeah. Well, she was cremated yesterday.
Now we got to forget and go on.
It won't be easy.
We don't have any children of our own.
You have any?
No, we don't.
Oh, well, there you have it.
Ohh! Oh... that's a nice--
Look how you put the table!
Now, isn't that interesting?
I saw it in a magazine.
Oh, my. Nice paintjob.
I know.
Ahh...well.
That's nice. What is that?
That's the TV room?
Yeah, well, only temporarily.
It's going to be a nursery.
Oh, you're pregnant?
No, not yet.
I hope to be as soon as we're settled.
Wonderful.
Well, you're young and healthy.
You ought to have lots ofchildren.
We plan to have three.
I'm dying to see what you did to this apartment.
The woman who had it before was a dear friend of mine.
I know.
Terry told me.
Well, did she?
You two had some long talks together in the laundry room.
Only one.
Oh! Oh, my goodness!
Ah ha ha!
It looks so much brighter.
What do you pay for a chair like that?
Um, I'm not sure, really.
I think about $200.
What does your hubby do?
He's an actor.
I knew it!
I said it to Roman yesterday.
He's so good-looking.
What movies was he in?
No movies.
He was in two plays called Luther and Nobody Loves an Albatross and a lot of television and radio.
Listen, Rosemary...
I got a 2-inch thick sirloin steak sitting defrosting right this minute.
Why don't you and Guy come over, have supper with us tonight?
What do you say?
Oh, no. We couldn't.
Why not?
No, really, that's very kind of you.
Listen--
It would be a real help to us.
Oh... first night we'll be alone since...
Oh, are you sure it wouldn't be too much trouble for you?
Oh, honey, if it was trouble,
I wouldn't ask you.
All right.
You go ahead and count on us.
I'll have to check with Guy, though.
Listen, you tell him
I won't take no for an answer!
Oh! Here's your mail!
Oh! Ads!
Thank you.
Yoo-hoo!
Hey.
Mmm!
Donald Baumgart got that part.
It's a bad play anyway.
Yeah. Even if it folds out of town, it's the kind of part that gets noticed.
Mrs. Castavet was here to thank me for what
I said about Terry.
She is the nosiest person I've ever seen.
You know she actually asked the prices of things?
No kidding.
She invited us to have dinner with them tonight.
I told her I'd have to check with you, but that it would probably be O.K.
Oh, Jesus! We don't have to do that, do we, honey?
I think they're lonely.
We get friendly with an old couple like that, and we'll never get rid of them.
They're right across the wall.
I told her she could count on us.
You don't have to sulk about it.
I'm not sulking.
I see exactly what you mean.
Hell, we'll go.
No, no. What for?
We'll go!
No. We don't have to if you don't want to.
That sounds so phony, but I really mean it, really, I do.
Be my good deed for the day.
O.K., but only if you want to.
We'll make it clear that it's just for this one night and not the beginning of anything, all right?
Oh! Perfect timing!
Come on in.
Roman's fixing us some vodka blushes.
My, I'm glad you could come, Guy.
I'm fixing to tell everybody that I knew you when.
Look, dinner isn't ready just yet, but sit down there anywhere.
Take a seat on the couch.
You'll find yourself very comfortable.
I seem to have overfilled the glasses.
No, no, no.
Don't get up.
Generally, I pour these out precisely as a bartender, don't l, Minnie?
Just watch the carpet.
But this evening I made a little too much, and rather I'm afr--
Oh, there we are.
No, no, no.
Sit down, please.
Now, Mrs. Woodhouse...
Uh, Mr. Woodhouse, uh, vodka blush?
Yes, thanks.
Have you ever tasted one?
No, no.
I haven't.
It looks delicious.
Minnie. They're very popular in Australia.
Now, to our guests-- welcome to our home.
Hear, hear.
Cheers.
Mmm.
The carpet.
Oh, dear.
Brand-new carpet.
This man is so clumsy!
Do you come from Australia?
Oh, no, no. I'm from right here in New York city.
I've been there, though.
I've been everywhere, literally.
You name a place, and I've been there.
Go ahead. Name a place.
Fairbanks, Alaska!
I've been there, been all over Alaska--
Yes--Fairbanks, Juneau, Anchorage,
Nome, Sitka, Seward.
I spent four months there in '38--
Where are you folks from?
Well--Well, l--
I'm from Omaha.
Guy's from Baltimore.
Omaha's a good city.
Baltimore is, too.
Do you travel for business?
Well, business and pleasure both.
I'm 79, and I've been going one place or another since I was 10.
You name a place,
I've been there.
Ah! Steak's ready.
Don't rush your drinks, now.
Roman, take your pill!
No Pope ever visits a city where the newspapers are on strike.
I heard he's going to postpone and wait till it's over.
Well, that's show biz.
That's exactly what it is.
All the costumes are rituals, all religions.
Oh, I think we're offending Rosemary.
No, no.
No, you're not religious, my dear, are you?
Well, l--I was brought up a Catholic.
Now I don't know.
You looked uncomfortable.
Well, he is the Pope.
Now, you don't need to have respect for him because he pretends that he's holy.
Now, that's a good point.
When I think what they spend on robes and jewels!
A good picture of the hypocrisy behind organized religion was given, I thought, in Luther.
Did you ever get to play that leading part, Guy?
Me? No.
Weren't you Albert Finney's understudy?
No.
Well, that's strange.
I remember being struck by a gesture you made and checking in the program to see who you were.
Um, what gesture was that?
Well, I'm not sure now.
It was a reaction--
Oh, I did a thing with my arms when Luther was having a fit.
It was a kind of involuntary reach.
That's it! That's it.
It had a wonderful authenticity to it.
Oh, come on.
-No, no. I mean it!
My father was a theatrical producer, and my early years were spent in the company of Mrs. Fiske, Forbes-Robertson,
Modjeska.
Guy?
Oh, yes, please.
You have a most interesting inner quality, Guy.
It appears in your television work, too.
It should take you a long way, indeed, provided, of course, that you get those initial breaks.
Are you preparing for a show now?
Um, well,
I'm up for a couple parts.
Well, I can't believe that you won't get them.
Well, I can.
I'd like to have a spice garden someday.
I guess I'm a country girl at heart.
You come from a big family?
Three brothers and two sisters.
Your sisters married?
They have children?
One has two, the other has four.
There's a chance you'll have lots of children, too.
We're fertile, all right.
I've got 16 nieces and nephews.
Oh, my goodness!
Would you like me to wash and you can wipe for a while?
Oh, no.
That's fine, dear.
Now, Roman, will you stop bending Guy's ears with your Modjeska stories?
He's only listening
'cause he's polite.
No, no, no, no.
It's very interesting, Mrs. Castavet.
Minnie!
I'm Minnie, he's Roman, O.K.?
O.K.?
O.K.
O.K.!
Terrific.
Just terrific.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye.
Thank you for having us.
Yeah, it was lovely.
Oh, bless you.
Minnie!
Minnie, ya good kid, ya.
Ooh!
About that steak, huh?
Oh, my God!
And the cake.
How did you eat two pieces?
It was weird.
Out of politeness.
That's how I ate two pieces.
Out of politeness.
Only three dinner plates that matched.
Shh!
And all that beautiful, beautiful silver.
We'll be nice.
Maybe they'll will it to us.
Oh!
Yeah.
Guess what they have in their bathroom.
A bidet.
Jokes for the John.
No.
A book on a hook right next to the toilet.
Roman's stories are pretty damned interesting, though.
Yeah?
Never even heard of Forbes-Robertson before.
I'm going to go over there again tomorrow night and hear some more.
You are?
Yeah. He asked me.
Here. Do this damn thing for me, will you?
I thought we were going to do something
With Joan and Dick Jellico.
- Was that definite?
- Well, it wasn't definite.
We'll see them next week.
You don't have to come along
If you don't want to.
You can stay here.
Yeah, I think I will stay here.
He knew Henry lrving, too.
I mean, really interesting, you know?
Why did they take their pictures down?
What do you mean?
Their pictures.
They took them down.
The hooks in the wall and clean spaces and the one picture that is there doesn't fit.
I didn't notice that.
Hi, dear.
We're not bothering you, are we?
This is my dear friend
Laura-Louise McBurney,
Lives up on 12.
Laura-Louise, this is Guy's wife Rosemary.
Hello, Rosemary.
Welcome to the Bram!
Laura-Louise just met Guy.
She wanted to meet you, too.
Could we come in?
Uh, of course. Please do.
There you are.
Go ahead.
Oh, look what you got.
There's a light.
Oh, gosh!
Isn't that beautiful!
It came this morning.
Are you all right, dear?
You look worn.
Oh, no. I'm fine.
It's the first day of my period.
And you're up and around?
On my first day,
I experienced such pain,
I couldn't move, eat, or anything.
Dan used to give me gin through a straw to kill the pain.
Girls today take things much more in their stride.
They're much healthier than we were,
Thanks to vitamins, better medical care.
What are those things over there, seat covers?
Um, cushions for the window seats.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, before I forget.
This is for you from Roman and me.
For me?
It's just a little present is all.
For moving in.
There's no reason--
It's real old.
It's over 300 years.
It's lovely.
Yeah. The green inside is called tannis root.
That's for good luck.
It's lovely, but l--
I can't accept it.
You already have.
Put it on.
-Yeah.
Ah, you'll get used to the smell before you know it.
Yeah, go on.
Ohh, yes.
Well, were his stories as interesting as last night?
Yes. Did you have a good time?
All right.
I got a present.
It was Terry's.
No kidding?
Kind of pretty, though.
Aren't you going to wear it?
It smells.
There's stuff in it called tannis root from her greenhouse.
Not too bad, though.
Tannis, anyone?
Well, if you took it, you ought to wear it.
Hello.
Yes.
This is he.
Oh, God, no.
Oh, the poor guy.
And, uh...
They don't have any idea what's causing it?
Oh, my God.
That's awful.
That's just awful.
Yes, I would.
I mean, yes, I am.
I hate to get it that way, but...
Well, you'd have to speak to my agent about that end of it.
Alan Stone.
I'm sure there won't be any problem,
Mr. Weiss, not as far as we're concerned.
Thank you, Mr. Weiss.
Guy?
What is it?
Donald Baumgart-- he's gone blind.
He woke up yesterday and he can't see.
Oh, no.
Oh, I've got the part.
It's a hell of a way to get it.
Listen, uh...
I have to get out and walk around.
I understand.
Go ahead.
Baumgart--
Donald Baumgart.
It's a fascinating part.
He'll really be noticed this time.
He also has an offer for a lead in a television series, Miami Beach.
He's suddenly very hot.
Mm-hmm. I understand why you're so overjoyed.
Well, it's a difficult period in his life.
A challenge.
I see.
You know how actors are.
They're all a bit self-centered.
I'll bet even
Laurence Olivier is vain and self-centered.
It's a difficult part.
He's got to work with crutches and, naturally, he's preoccupied.
And he... well, preoccupied.
I see you had another suicide up there at happy house.
Oh, didn't I tell you?
No, you didn't.
It was that girl
I told you about, the drug-addict who was rehabilitated by this old couple, the Castavets.
I'm sure I told you that.
They didn't rehabilitate her very successfully, it seems.
I've been a creep.
It's from worrying if Baumgart would regain his sight, rat that I am.
Oh, it's natural.
You're bound to feel two ways about it.
Even if I'm Mr. Yamaha for the rest of my days,
I'm going to stop giving you the short end of the stick.
You haven't been.
Yes, I have.
I've been tearing my hair out over my career.
Let's have a baby.
All right?
Let's have three babies, one at a time, all right?
A baby. You know.
Mama, dada, poo-poo. you know?
You mean it?
Sure, I mean it.
I mean, I even figured out the right time to start,
Look.
You mean it, really?
No, I'm kidding.
Sure, I mean it.
Oh, Ro, honey, for God's sake, don't cry.
I won't. I won't.
Here goes nothing.
Mmm-unh! The paint!
The paint!
Good grief.
Nobody, but nobody has a fire tonight.
Isn't it gorgeous?
I hope we have the coldest winter ever.
Oh, shit!
Hi, Guy! How are ya?
No, don't let her in.
Not tonight.
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Oh, are you sure you don't want to come in?
No! I don't want to bother you.
Good.
Good.
Who says there's nothing to ESP?
Madame and monsieur shall have ze dessert after all!
Mousse au chocolat.
Or as Minnie calls it-- chocolate mouse.
I was afraid she'd stay all evening.
She just wanted us to try it.
Seein' it's one of her specialities.
It was sweet of her, really.
We shouldn't make fun of her.
Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.
Mmm! It's good.
Has an undertaste.
A chalky undertaste.
I don't get it.
That's silly, honey.
There is no undertaste.
There is.
Come on. The old bat slaved all day.
Now eat it.
-I don't like it.
-It's delicious.
Here. You can have mine.
All right. Don't eat it.
There's always something wrong.
Oh, if it's going to turn into a big thing--
Look, if you really can't stand it, just don't eat it.
Mmm! It's delicious!
No undertaste at all.
Would you turn the record over, please?
There, Daddy, do I get a gold star?
You get two of them.
I'm sorry if I was stuffy.
You were.
...is making a full circle of the ball park...
It's the Pope at Yankee Stadium!
...to his specially built canopy at second base.
Put him out!
Listen to that crowd roar.
Everywhere the Pope
Has been today, he's received this type of reception.
As one man put it
This afternoon,
"Perhaps we are being undignified, but this is a special day. "
And a special day it has been.
That's a great spot for my Yamaha commercial.
I'd like to give you a brief summary of today's historic happening.
Pope Paul VI arrived at 9.:27A.M.
What is it?
Dizzy.
Hey.
No wonder.
All that booze.
You didn't eat anything all day before dinner, huh?
Hey.
Hey.
Nice.
Sleep is what you need.
A good night's sleep.
We have to make a baby.
Oh, we'll... we'll do it.
Tomorrow.
There's plenty of time.
Just a nap.
Why are you taking them off?
To make you more comfortable.
I am more comfortable.
Sleep, Ro.
Isn't Hutch coming with us?
Catholics only,
I wish we weren't bound by these prejudices, but, unfortunately...
Easy, easy.
You got her too high.
Typhoon!
Typhoon!
It killed 55 people in London and it's heading this way!
You better go down below, Miss.
She's awake.
She sees.
She don't see.
As long as she ate the mouse,
She can't hear.
She's like dead. Now sing.
I'm sorry to hear you aren't feeling well.
It's only the mouse bite.
You'd better have your legs tied down in case of convulsions.
Yes, I suppose so.
There's always a chance it was rabid. lf the music bothers you,
Iet me know, and I'll have it stopped.
Oh, no, no, no.
Please don't change the program on my account.
Try to sleep.
We'll be waiting up on deck.
This is no dream!
This is really happening!
They tell me you have been bitten by a mouse.
Yes. That's why I couldn't come to see you.
That's all right.
We wouldn't want you
To jeopardize your health.
Am I forgiven, father?
Oh, absolutely.
Hey, it's after 9:00.
Uhm.
Five minutes.
I have to be at Alan's at 10:00.
Eat out.
Like hell I will.
What time is it?
It's 10 after 9:00.
What time did I go to sleep?
You didn't go to sleep.
You passed out.
From now on you get cocktails or wine,
Not cocktails and wine, hmm?
The dreams I had.
Don't yell.
I already filed them down.
I didn't want to miss baby night.
A couple of my nails were ragged.
-While I was out?
And it was kind of fun, in a necrophile sort of way.
I dreamed someone was raping me.
I don't know, someone inhuman.
Thanks a lot!
What's the matter?
-Nothing.
I didn't want to miss the night.
We could've done it this morning or tonight.
Last night wasn't the only split second.
I was a little bit loaded myself, you know?
Oh! Hello there.
Did ya like it?
Oh, yeah.
I think I put a little too much cream de cocoa in it.
No, no.
It was delicious.
You'll have to give me the recipe.
Yeah, love to.
Oh, listen, you going shopping?
Do me a teeny favor, will ya?
Get me six eggs, a small instant Sanka.
I'll pay you later.
Right. Bye-bye.
Don't you think we ought to talk about it?
About what?
The way you haven't been looking at me.
What are you talking about?
I've been looking at you.
You haven't.
Why, sure, I have.
Now, what is it?
What's the matter?
Nothing. Never mind.
No, no. Don't say that.
What is it?
Nothing.
Look, honey, l--
I know I've been preoccupied with the part and all, but it is important.
That doesn't mean
I don't love you.
It was due on Friday.
It was?
It'll probably come tonight or tomorrow.
- Wanna bet?
- Yeah.
- A quarter.
- O.K.
You're going to lose.
Shut up, will you?
You're getting me all jumpy.
It's only been two days.
When will I know?
I'll call you just as soon as I get the results.
I like to do a general examination just to know something more...
It was Elise Dunstan who recommended you to me, Doctor.
Oh, yes.
How is she?
She's fine. And the boys are great.
Did you deliver all of them?
No, just the last.
Universal hemoglobin.
Yes, Doctor.
We went to see
The Fantasticks.
-Did you?
-Mmm.
Did you enjoy it?
-Yeah.
Good.
Hello?
Mrs. Woodhouse?
Dr. Hill?
Congratulations.
-Really?
-Really.
Are you there?
Uh, yes, um, what happens now?
You come see me next month.
You get those Natalin pills.
One a day.
I'll mail you forms for the hospital.
Uh, when will it be?
It works out to be June 28th.
-That sounds so far away!
-It is.
One more thing,
Mrs. Woodhouse, we'd like another blood sample.
Oh, yes, of course.
What for?
The nurse didn't take enough, so would you drop by and see her?
But I am pregnant, aren't l?
Oh, yes, it's just for blood samp--
Blood sugar and so forth.
But you're pregnant.
Don't worry.
All right.
Well, I'll come in on Monday.
All right.
Don't forget the pills.
No, I won't.
-Goodbye, Mrs. Woodhouse.
-Goodbye, Dr. Hill.
Blood sugar?
What's that?
Oh!
That's great.
That's just great.
Father.
Mother.
Guy, Guy, listen.
Let's, uh, make this a new beginning, O.K.?
A new openness in talking to each other, because we haven't been open.
That's true.
I've been so goddamned self-centered.
That's what the whole trouble is.
You know I love you, don't you, Ro?
I do. I swear to God
I'm going to be as open and--
It's my fault as much as yours.
No, bull, it's mine.
Now you bear with me.
I'll try and do better, you hear?
Oh, Guy.
What?
It's... a fine way for parents to be carrying on.
Hey... know what I'd love to do?
What?
Tell Minnie and Roman.
Oh, I know, I know.
It's, uh... it's, uh, supposed to be a deep, dark secret, but I already told them that we were trying.
They were so pleased.
Tell them.
Back in two minutes?
You're pregnant.
Another blood sample.
Ta-da!
Now, that's what
I call good news.
Aw, honey, congratulations.
Thank you.
-Best wishes, Rosemary.
-Thank you very much.
We are more pleased than we can say.
We didn't have any champagne on hand, but this will do just as nicely.
When are you due, dear?
June 28th.
Oh, it's going to be so exciting.
Listen, dear, you got a good doctor?
Oh, yes, a very good one.
One of the top obstetricians is a dear friend of ours,
Abe Sapirstein.
Delivers all the society babies.
Abe Sapirstein?
One of the finest obstetricians in the country.
Wasn't he on Open End a couple of years ago?
That's right.
Ro?
Uh... well, what about Dr. Hill?
Don't worry about Hill.
I'll tell him something.
You know me.
Listen, I won't let you go to no Dr. Hill nobody ever heard of.
The best is what you're going to have, young lady.
Where's your telephone, huh?
It's in the bedroom.
He's a brilliant man.
Very sensitive.
Ro, sit down, sit down.
No, I'm fine.
Abe, Minnie. Fine.
Listen, Abe, a dear friend of ours just found out today she's pregnant.
Yeah, isn't it?
I'm in her apartment right now.
We told her you'd be glad to take care of her.
You wouldn't charge her none of your fancy society prices neither.
Well, just wait a minute.
Rosemary, tomorrow morning at 11:00?
All right.
Yeah, 11:00's fine, Abe.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, you, too.
No, no, no, no, not at all.
All right.
Well, let's hope so.
Goodbye.
Well, there you are.
Thanks a million, Minnie.
I don't know how to thank you.
Both of you.
Just have a fine, healthy baby, that's all.
My, I can't wait to tell
Laura-Louise.
Oh... uh, please don't tell anyone else, not right away.
No, she's right.
There's plenty of time.
Now, to a fine, healthy baby.
-Hear, hear.
-Hear!
Andy. or Susan.
Susan.
Please don't read books.
No pregnancy was ever exactly like the ones described in the books.
And don't listen to your friends, either.
No two pregnancies are ever alike.
Dr. Hill prescribed vitamin pills.
-No pills.
Minnie Castavet has a herbarium.
I'm going to have her make a daily drink for you that'll be fresher, safer, and more vitamin-rich than any pills on the market.
Any questions you have, call me night or day.
Call me, not your Aunt Fanny.
That's what I'm here for.
-Here.
-What's in it?
Snips and snails and puppy dogs' tails.
That's fine, but what if we want a girl?
Do you?
It would be nice if the first one were a boy.
Well, there you are.
No, really, what is in it?
A raw egg, gelatin, herbs.
Tannis root?
Some of that along with some other things.
Don't be so violent, Harry.
If you want to be stupid, be nonviolent stupid,
I'm in love with no one.
Especially not your fat wife.
I'm a hopeless cripple...
What's that?
I-I've been to Vidal Sassoon.
Don't tell me you paid for that.
Guy,
I have a pain.
Where?
Here.
Just now?
Since Monday.
A sharp pain.
Did you see Sapirstein?
I'm seeing him on Wednesday.
This is ridiculous.
Why don't you see Sapirstein?
Why didn't you say anything?
I see him Wednesday regular.
An entirely natural expansion of the pelvis.
You can fight it with ordinary aspirin.
I was afraid it might be an ectopic pregnancy.
Ectopic?
I thought you weren't going to read books, Rosemary.
-It was staring at me in the drugstore.
-All it did was worry you.
Will you go home and throw it away, please?
The pains will be gone in two days.
Ectopic pregnancy!
I look awful.
What are you talking about?
You look great!
It's that haircut that looks awful.
You want the truth, honey, that's the worst mistake you ever made.
My God!
It's Vidal Sassoon.
It's very in.
What's wrong with you?
Do I look that bad?
Terrible!
You're not on one
Of those Zen diets, are you?
No.
Then what is it?
Have you seen a doctor?
Hutch, I might as well tell you.
I'm pregnant.
Oh, rubbish.
Pregnant women gain weight.
They don't lose it.
I don't sleep well.
I have stiff joints or something, so I get a pain.
Nothing serious.
Well, congratulations.
You must be very happy.
Oh, I am.
We both are.
Who's your obstetrician?
Abraham Sapirstein.
Oh! He delivered two of my daughter's babies.
He's one of the best in the city.
When did you see him last?
Um, yesterday.
And?
And he says it's fairly common.
How much weight have you lost?
Uh, 3 pounds.
Nonsense. You've lost far more than that.
It's perfectly normal to lose a little at first.
Later on, I'll be gaining.
Well... we must assume Dr. Sapirstein knows where of he speaks.
He should.
He charges enough.
We're getting bargain rates.
Our neighbors are close friends of his.
I'll go.
Stay where you are.
It hurts less when I move around.
Oh, I was just talking about you.
Favorably, I hope.
Do you need anything from outside?
No. Thank you for asking.
Is Guy home already?
He won't be home till 6:00.
Oh.
A friend of ours is here.
Would you-- would you like to meet him?
If I won't be intruding.
No. Please come in.
Hutch, this is Roman Castavet.
Edward Hutchins.
How do you do?
Oh, how are you, sir?
I was just telling Hutch that it was you and Minnie who sent me to Dr. Sapirstein.
Oh, so Rosemary has told you the good news.
Yes, she has.
We must see that she gets plenty of rest.
I was a bit alarmed by her appearance.
Well, she has lost some weight, but that's quite normal for the early months.
Later on, she'll gain, probably far too much.
So I gather.
Please sit down.
Mrs. Castavet makes a vitamin drink for me every day from fresh herbs she grows.
Yes, all according to Dr. Sapirstein's directions, of course.
He's inclined to be suspicious of commercially prepared vitamin pills.
Indeed?
But surely they're manufactured under every imaginable safeguard.
That's quite true, but commercial pills can sit for months on a druggist's shelf and lose a great deal of their original potency.
I hadn't thought of that.
I like the idea of having everything fresh and natural.
I'll bet expectant mothers chewed bits of tannis root when nobody'd even heard of vitamin pills.
Tannis root?
It's one of the herbs she puts in the drink.
Or is it an herb?
Can a root be an herb?
You sure you don't mean anise or orris root?
No, tannis.
Look.
It's good luck, too.
Ish!
Doesn't look like, uh, root matter, more like mold or fungus of some kind.
Is it ever called by any other name?
Not to my knowledge, no.
Tannis. I must look it up in the encyclopedia.
What a pretty holder or charm or whatever it is.
The Castavets gave it to me.
You and your wife seem to be taking better care of Rosemary than her own parents.
We're very fond of her.
And of Guy, too.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll have to go.
My wife is waiting for me.
It's a pleasure to have met you.
Oh, don't bother, Rosemary.
We'll meet again, I'm sure.
I just noticed he has pierced ears.
Pierced ears and piercing eyes.
What's she like?
Nosy.
Funny.
Guy's gotten very close to them.
I suppose they've become sort of parent figures for him.
And you?
I--I don't know.
Sometimes I think they're too friendly and helpful.
Hey, what a surprise.
How are you, Hutch?
Good to see you.
You're the surprise.
What happened?
They stopped for a rewrite, those dumb bastards.
Ah, stay where you are.
Nobody move.
Would you like some coffee?
Love some!
Loot!
Seems congratulations are in order.
Yeah, it's wonderful, isn't it?
When's the baby due?
June 28th.
Did you know that Dr. Sapirstein delivered two of
Hutch's grandchildren?
-Really?
-Mmm.
I met your neighbor.
Roman Castavet.
Oh, did you?
Funny old duck, isn't he?
Did you ever notice he has pierced ears?
-You're kidding.
-No, I'm not. I saw.
It's a shame we haven't seen more of you lately, but with me being so busy and Ro being the way she is, we really haven't seen anyone.
Perhaps we can have dinner together soon.
You're not going, are you?
Thanks for the coffee, my dear.
Thank you for coming, my dear.
This isn't mine.
It must be yours, right?
Right you are.
Have you thought about names, or is it too soon?
Andrew or Douglas if it's a boy,
Melinda or Sarah if it's a girl.
Sarah? What happened to Susan?
Say, is there another of these around?
Oh.
I don't see it, Hutch.
No, it's not here.
I probably left it at the City Center.
I'll stop back there.
Let's really have that dinner, shall we?
Definitely.
Next week.
Bye.
Goodbye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
It was a nice surprise.
Guess what he said.
What?
I look terrible.
Good old Hutch.
He's spreading cheer wherever he goes.
I'm going to get a paper, honey.
He's a professional crepehanger.
He's not a professional crepehanger.
Then he's one of the top-ranking amateurs.
Hello.
Oh, uh, she's not feeling too well.
Well, I think she's asleep.
All right.
Oh, she could be, yeah.
All right, can you hold on a minute?
It's Hutch.
He wants to speak to you.
Oh.
I told him you were resting, but he said he couldn't wait.
Hutch?
Tell me, dear, do you go out at all?
Well, I--I haven't been going out, why?
Can you meet me tomorrow morning at 11:00 in front of the Time-Life building?
Yes, if you want me to.
What is it?
Can't you tell me now?
I'd rather not.
We can have an early lunch if you like.
That would be nice.
Good. 11:00 then?
O.K.
Oh, did you find your glove?
No, they didn't have it.
Good night, Rosemary.
Sleep well.
You, too.
Good night.
What was that?
He wants to talk to me.
What about?
I don't know.
He wouldn't say.
I think those boys' adventure stories are going to his head.
Where are you meeting him?
Uh, Time and Life building tomorrow at 11:00.
This is ridiculous.
You're pregnant,
I've got the yens.
I'm getting an ice-cream cone.
You want one?
Yeah, I'd love one.
Vanilla?
O.K.
O.K.
Hi.
Minnie, I'm going out now, so I won't have my drink at 11:00.
That's fine, dear.
Take it later.
Buzz me when you get back, huh?
Pain, be gone.
I will have no more of thee.
Yes?
Is this Edward Hutchins' apartment?
Yes. Who is this, please?
My name is
Rosemary Woodhouse.
I had an appointment with Mr. Hutchins.
Is he there?
Hello?
He was taken ill this morning.
-Taken ill?
-Yes.
He's in a deep coma at St. Vincent's hospital.
That's awful.
I--I--I just spoke to him last night about 10:30.
I spoke to him at 11:00.
Who is this?
You don't know me,
Rosemary.
I'm Grace Cardiff,
Hutch's friend.
Um, do they know what's causing it?
No, they don't know yet.
At the moment, he's totally unresponsive.
Oh, I'm going to the hospital now.
Is there anything
I can do?
Not really.
All right, um, thank you.
No!
This is what I call the long arm of coincidence!
I said to myself, as long as Rosemary's going out,
I might as well go out and do a little bit of Christmas shopping.
Now here you are, here I am.
Isn't that something?
Aw, darling, what's the matter?
You feel all right?
Aw... aw, you poor thing.
You know what I think?
I think we better be going home now.
What do you say?
No, no, you have your shopping to do.
Ah, shoot, there's two more weeks.
It'll stop any day now.
It's like a wire inside me getting tighter and tighter.
Usually older women with less flexible joints have this sort of trouble.
I'm not going out anymore.
You don't have to.
One minute to go!
Rosemary,
I want you to meet Dr. Shand.
He used to be a famous dentist.
He made the chain
For your charm.
Oh, how do you do?
Come on, sweetie.
Put this wonderful hat on.
Doctor, come over here.
Minnie, Minnie.
Happy New Year.
Have a good year.
Happy New Year.
To 1966!
The Year 1 !
What the hell are you doing?
Planning the menu.
We're having a party a week from Saturday.
It's for our old--
I mean, our young friends.
Minnie and Roman are not invited.
Neither is Laura-Louise.
Nor is Dr. Sapirstein.
It's going to be a very special party.
You have to be under 60 to get in.
Well.
For a minute there,
I didn't think
I was going to make it.
You'll make it, all right.
You can be bartender.
Oh, swell.
Do you really think it's such a good idea?
I think it's the best idea
I've had in months.
Don't you think you ought to check with Dr. Sapirstein first?
What for?
I'm just giving a party.
I'm not going to swim the English Channel.
What about the pain?
Oh, haven't you heard?
It'll go away in a day or two.
That looks interesting.
What's it for?
We're having some people over on Saturday.
Oh, you feel up to entertaining?
Yes, I do.
These are old friends
I haven't seen in a long time.
They don't even know yet that I'm pregnant.
I'll give you a hand if you like.
I'll help you dish things out.
No, thank you, Minnie, but I can manage.
It's going to be a buffet, and we're getting a bartender, so...
I'll help you take the coats.
No, really, you do too much for me as it is.
Well, let me know if you change your mind.
Drink your drink now.
I'd rather not.
Not right this minute.
I'll drink it in a little while.
It don't do to let it stand.
No, I won't wait too long.
You go on back, and I'll bring the glass back to you later.
I'll wait.
I'll save you the walk.
You'll do no such thing.
It makes me very nervous when people watch me cook.
Now, scoot.
Don't let it stand too long.
It's going to lose its vitamins.
You dirty, stinking secret-keeper.
Congratulations!
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.
-Hey, Rosie.
-Yeah?
Bob and Leo got stuck at another party, dear, but they'll be over right away.
Oh, fine.
Oh Rosie, you're so lucky.
It's a fantastic house.
Hi.
It's been so long!
You look like a piece of chalk!
You make him feed you, luv.
-Adrian Marcato lived here.
- Yeah, and the Trench sisters.
-Trent sisters?
-Trench. They ate little children.
He doesn't just mean they ate them.
He means they ate them.
I made their first one strong to get them happy, then I go light and conserve, eh?
Rosie, do you feel O.K.?
You look a little tired.
Thanks for the understatement.
How do you like C.C. Hill?
Isn't he a dream boy?
Mm-hmm, but I--I--
I'm not going to him.
You're not?
I've got another doctor named Sapirstein, an older man.
Oh, congratulations, Papa.
Thanks. Weren't nothing to it.
Ro, I'm going to take that dip inside.
Oh, yeah, please.
See my flowers?
Yeah.
Elise, will you give me a hand?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Hey, whatever happened to the other guy?
-Is he still blind?
-Donald Baumgart?
Well, you know who he is.
He's the boy that Zoe Piper lives with.
He's writing a play.
-Is he still blind?
-Excuse me.
Yeah. He's going through hell trying to make the adjustment.
He dictates and Zoe writes.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just had a cramp for a minute.
Don't cry.
It's all right. It's good for her.
Let her cry it out.
It's all right, darling.
It's all right.
Sit down, sit down.
-Hey, let me in.
-Sorry, girls only.
-I want to talk to Rosemary.
-You can't. She's busy.
I have to wash these--
Use the bathroom.
It hurts so much!
I'm so afraid the baby's gonna die.
When did the pain start?
Um... in, uh, November.
November?
What?
You have been in pain since November, and he's not doing anything to help you?
He says it's gonna stop.
Why don't you go to see another doctor?
No, he's very good.
He was on Open End.
He sounds like a sadistic nut.
Rosemary, pain like that is a warning that something isn't right.
Go see Dr. Hill.
Go see anybody besides that...that...
That nut.
You can't go on suffering like this.
I won't have an abortion.
Nobody's telling you to have an abortion.
Just go to see another doctor, that's all.
The thing to do now is move.
Guy?
Yeah?
I'm going to Dr. Hill
Monday morning.
Dr. Sapirstein is either lying, or he's...
I don't know, out of his mind.
Pain like this is a warning something's wrong.
Rosemary... and I'm not drinking
Minnie's drink anymore.
I want vitamins and pills like everyone else.
I haven't drunk it for the last three days.
I've thrown it away.
You've what?
I've made my own drink.
Is that what those bitches were giving you in there?
And is that their hint for today?
They're my friends--
They're a bunch of not very bright bitches who ought to mind their own goddamn business!
All they said was get a second opinion.
Rosemary, you got the best doctor in New York.
You know who Dr. Hill is?
He's a Charlie Nobody.
That's who he is!
I'm tired of hearing how great Dr. Sapirstein is.
Well, we'll have to pay Sapirstein, we'll have to pay Hill.
It's out of the question.
No, I'm not changing.
I just wanna go to Dr. Hill and get a second opinion.
I won't let you do it, Ro.
I mean, because it's, uh... it's not fair to Sapirstein.
Not fair to...
What are you talking about?
What about what's fair to me?
You want a second opinion?
You tell Sapirstein and let him decide who gives it.
No! I want Dr. Hill!
At least have that much courtesy--
If you won't pay, then I'll...
Ro?
Rosemary?
What is it?
It stopped.
What?
The pain stopped just like that.
Stopped?
-Stopped.
What was in that drink you made?
Uh... eggs, milk, sug-- sugar.
What else?
What else?
Come on, Rosemary, for Christ's sake, what else was in that drink?
It's alive!
Guy, it's moving!
It's alive!
It's all right!
Feel.
Feel.
Oh, yeah, I felt it.
Don't be scared.
It won't bite you.
It's wonderful.
It really is.
I feel it kicking.
It's alive!
It's moving!
I'll, uh, clean up some of this mess.
Watch the walls.
Thanks, boys.
Have one on the baby.
Thank you very much.
What's that for?
This is my hospital suitcase.
Honey, you got three weeks.
Yes?
Hello, Mrs. Cardiff.
No.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Yes, of course I will.
Hutch is dead.
I feel awful.
All this time,
I didn't even think of him.
Doris, we'll see you later.
I beg your pardon.
I'm Mrs. Woodhouse.
I knew your father.
Oh, so you're Rosemary.
I'm terribly sorry.
Thank you.
This is my sister Edna.
How do you do?
And my husband.
How do you do?
I'm sorry to be late.
Excuse me.
Yes?
I'm Grace Cardiff.
I was hoping to meet you.
Thank you for calling me.
I was going to mail this, but then I thought you were going to be here.
What is it?
-A book.
Hutch regained consciousness at the end, and he thought it was the next morning.
You know, when you had the appointment.
Oh, yes.
I wasn't there, but he told the doctor to make sure you got the book that was on his desk.
Thank you.
Oh, and I'm to tell you the name is an anagram.
The name of the book?
Apparently.
He was delirious, so it's hard to be sure.
I heard you come in.
It certainly wasn't very long.
I was late.
I couldn't get a taxi.
Oh, what a shame.
Oh, you got mail already?
Somebody gave it to me.
Here. I'll hold it.
Book.
Oh, I know that house.
The Gilmores used to live there.
Oh?
-Yeah.
I've been there lots of times.
Grace-- That's one of my favorite names.
Yes.
You need anything?
Nothing, thank you.
Take a nap, why don't you?
I'm going to.
Yeah. Goodbye.
"Born in Glasgow in 1846,
He was soon after brought to New York.
He resided for several years in the United St--
He was attacked by a mob outside the Bram..."
Outside, not in the lobby.
There are no witches.
Not really.
The name is an anagram.
Now, that really makes sense.
Poor Hutch.
Ro?
What's with the chain?
What's the matter?
You all right?
-I'm fine.
Oh.
Oh, why, thank you.
How was the funeral?
O.K.
Got the shirt that was in the New Yorker.
I got that shirt that was in the New Yorker.
That's nice.
Do you know who Roman really is?
What do you mean, honey?
He's Adrian Marcato's son.
What?
Come here.
I want to show you something.
Roman Castavet is Steven Marcato rearranged.
It's from Hutch.
Look.
And look here.
There he is when he was 13.
See the eyes?
Coincidence.
In the same house?
And look. Look here.
"Soon after that in August, 1886, his son Steven was born."
1886. Got it?
That makes him 79 now.
No coincidence.
No, I guess not.
He's Steven Marcato, all right.
Poor old geezer.
With a crazy father like that, no wonder he switched his name around.
You don't think he's the same?
What do you mean, a witch?
Ro, are you kidding?
Oh, Ro, honey.
His father was a martyr to it.
Do you know how he died?
Honey, it's 1966.
This was published in 1933.
There were covens in Europe.
That's what they're called-- the congregation.
Covens in Europe, in America, and in Australia, and they have one right here, that whole bunch.
The parties with the singing and the flute and the chanting, those are esbats or sabbaths or whatever they're called.
Honey, don't get excited.
Read what they do, Guy.
They use blood in their rituals.
The blood that has the most power is baby's blood.
And they don't just use the blood, they use the flesh, too.
Rosemary, for God's sakes!
They're not setting foot in this apartment ever again.
They're not coming within 50 feet of the baby.
They're old people.
They have a bunch of old friends.
Dr. Shand happens to play the recorder.
I'm not taking any chances with the baby's safety.
We're gonna sublet and move out.
We are not.
-Oh, yes we are!
We'll talk about it later.
I don't think you ought to read any more of that.
-Just this last chapter.
-Not today, honey.
Look. Your hands are shaking.
Come on. Give it to me.
Read it tomorrow.
-Guy!
I mean it, now.
Give it to me.
Fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.
What'd you say the name was,
"Marchado"?
Marcato.
He told me his father was a coffee importer.
He told Guy he was a producer.
I understand how disturbed you must be to have him for a close neighbor.
I don't want anything more to do with him or Minnie.
I can't take even the slightest chance for the baby's sake.
Absolutely.
Any mother'd feel the same way.
Is there any chance at all that maybe Minnie put something harmful in those drinks or in those little cakes?
No, Rosemary, I'd have seen evidence of it long ago.
I won't take anything else from them.
You won't have to.
I can give you some pills that'll be adequate these last few weeks.
In a way, this may be the answer to Minnie's and
Roman's problem, too.
What do you mean?
Roman's very ill.
In fact, confidentially, he has no more than a month or two left.
I had no idea.
He wanted to pay a last visit to a few of his favorite cities.
They didn't want to offend you by leaving before the baby's birth.
I'm sorry to hear that Roman isn't well.
He'd be extremely embarrassed if he knew what you found out.
Suppose we do this.
I'll tell him to leave on Sunday.
I'll say I spoke to you and you understand.
Are you sure they'll leave on Sunday?
I'll see to it.
No matter where we are, our thoughts are gonna be with you every minute till you're all happy and thin again.
Your sweet little boy or girl laying safely in your arms.
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.
Yeah. You make Guy send us lots of pictures, ya hear?
Yes, I will.
Now, I'm not going to wish you good luck because you won't need it.
You're going to have a happy, happy life.
Have a good trip and come back safely.
Perhaps. But I may stay in Dubrovnik or Pescara or maybe Majorca.
We shall see, we shall see.
Come back.
Bye, Minnie.
Yeah, goodbye.
Goodbye, Roman.
Bye-bye.
Take care now.
Kennedy Airport,
Pan Am Building.
Bye!
Bye, Roman.
Oh, boy.
Guy?
Hmm?
Where's my book?
Oh, I put it in the garbage.
What?
I didn't want you upsetting yourself anymore.
Guy, Hutch gave me that book.
He left it to me.
I wasn't thinking about that.
That's a terrible thing to do.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking about Hutch.
Hey, watch out, lady!
"Some cultures believed that a personal possession of the victim is necessary and spells cannot be cast without one of the victim's belongings."
Yeah?
Is this Donald Baumgart?
That's right.
This is Rosemary Woodhouse,
Guy Woodhouse's wife.
Oh, yes.
I want to know--
You must be a happy little lady, living in the Bram, rows of uniformed lackeys.
I wanted to know how you are, if there's been any improvement.
Well, bless your heart.
Guy Woodhouse's wife, huh?
Well, I'm splendid.
I only broke six glasses today.
Guy and I are both very unhappy that he got his break because of your misfortune.
Aw, what the hell.
That's the way it goes, right?
I'm sorry I didn't come along that day he came to visit you.
V-Visit?
Oh, you mean the day we met for drinks?
Yes, that's what I meant.
By the way, he has something of yours, you know.
What do you mean?
Don't you know?
No.
Didn't you miss anything that day?
You don't mean my tie, do you?
Yes.
Oh, well, he's got mine, and I've got his.
He can have it back.
I'm sorry.
Doesn't matter to me now what color tie I'm wearing.
I didn't understand.
I thought he'd only borrowed it.
Oh, no.
It was a trade.
Or... do you think he stole it?
I have to hang up now.
I just wanted to know if there'd been any improvement.
No, no, there isn't.
It was nice of you to call. Bye.
You aren't in labor, are you?
No, but I have to see the doctor.
It's very important.
But he has to leave at 5:00, and there is Mrs. Byron.
I'm sure he'll see you.
Just sit down.
Thank you.
How is it out there?
Oh, awful. 94.
Ugh!
See you next week.
Make an appointment.
Yes, I will.
You're due any day now, aren't you?
Tuesday.
You're smart to get it over with before August.
Mrs. Byron.
He'll see you right after.
Well, let's see, um...
July the 10th?
What time?
Fine.
All right.
See you then.
Thank you.
-Bye-bye.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Mmm! That smells nice.
What is it?
Oh, my--
It's called detchema.
Well, it's a big improvement on your regular, if you don't mind my saying.
That wasn't a perfume.
That was a good luck charm.
I threw it away.
Good.
Maybe the doctor will follow your example.
Dr. Sapirstein?
Yes. The aftershave.
Well, it isn't, is it?
I don't think he has a good luck charm.
Anyway, he has the same smell once in a while.
When he does--
Oh, boy.
Haven't you ever noticed?
No.
Well, maybe you thought it was your own you were smelling.
What is it, a chemical thing?
Will you excuse me a moment, please?
My husband is waiting outside.
I have to go and tell him something.
I'll be back in a minute.
Dr. Hill's office.
Dr. Hill, please.
This is his answering service.
Would you like to leave a message?
Um, yes.
My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.
Woodhouse.
And would you ask him to call me back right away, please?
Uh, my number is
It's an emergency.
I'm in a phone booth.
All right.
Quickly, please,
Dr. Hill, call me.
Oh, oh, really?
Did he really say that?
Oh, he didn't say that.
What else was it that he said?
Oh, that's wonderful.
That's wonder--
That's marvelous.
Yes. Dr. Hill?
Did I get the name right?
Is it Rosemary Woodhouse?
Yes.
Are you Dr. Hill's patient?
No.
Um, yes, I mean, well, I've seen him once.
Um, please, please tell him he has to speak to me.
It's important.
Tell him to call me, hmm?
-All right.
-Thank you.
All of them.
All of them.
All in it together.
All of them.
All of them witches.
Don't you worry, little Andy or Jenny,
I'll kill them before
I let them touch you.
Yes. Dr...
Mrs. Woodhouse?
Yes!
Oh, thank you,
Thank you for calling me.
Thought you were in California.
No. No, I've been to another doctor, and he isn't good,
Dr. Hill.
He's been lying to me and giving me unusual kinds of drinks and capsules.
The baby's due on Tuesday.
Remember you told me
June 28th?
Well, I want you to deliver it.
Mrs. Woodhouse...
Please let me talk to you.
Let me come and explain what's been going on.
I can't stay too long here.
They'll be coming, looking for me.
Dr. Hill?
Dr. Hill, there's a plot--
I know that sounds crazy.
You're probably thinking,
"My God, this poor girl has really flipped," but I haven't flipped,
Dr. Hill, I swear.
By all the saints,
I haven't.
There are plots against people, aren't there?
Yes, I suppose there are.
Well, then there's one against me and my baby.
Come to my office tomorrow after 5:00.
No!
Right now.
Mrs. Woodhouse,
I'm not at my office now.
I'm home. I've been up since yesterday morning.
I beg you.
I beg you.
I can't stay here.
My office at 8:00.
-Yes, thank you.
Oh, wait! Dr. Hill?
Yes?
My husband may call you, asking--
I'm not gonna speak to anyone.
I'm gonna take a nap.
Thank you.
Keep the change.
Uh, driver, please, could you wait and watch until-- until I'm inside the door?
He lied to you.
He said we were going to Hollywood.
The worst thing of all, he's involved with them as well.
He sleeps in pajamas now.
He never used to before.
He's probably hiding a mark.
You know they give you marks when you join--
All sorts of rituals.
They hold sabbaths there.
You could hear them singing through the wall.
Guy, my husband Guy said it was Dr. Shand, one of these people playing a recorder.
Now, how did he know it was Dr. Shand unless he was there with them?
Um, they're very clever people.
They planned everything right from the beginning.
They probably made some sort of deal with Guy.
They gave him success, and he promised them our baby to use in their rituals.
I know this sounds crazy, but I've--I've got books here.
Look.
There was another actor like him,
Donald Baumgart, and they put a spell on him.
They cast a spell on him and made him blind so that Guy could get his part.
Look, here.
I had this friend
Edward Hutchins.
Maybe you heard of him, a writer.
He wrote stories for boys.
Anyway, he was my good friend since I first came to New York.
May I keep this?
Yes, please, and, look, anyway, once Mr. Hutchins came to visit me--
Came to visit me. It was the time
I was having this pain, Doctor.
I was suffering so-- You can't imagine how much I was suffering, and they wouldn't help me.
Nobody would.
They were giving me a drink with tannis root in it.
Also witches' stuff, tannis root.
Hutch came, and he immediately saw something was wrong.
He--He knew about witches, you see.
Suddenly, Guy rushed in with his makeup still on, which he never did.
They probably called him to come home and steal one of
Hutch's belongings, which he did.
Took his glove, and they put a spell on him, too.
Put him in a coma.
Three months later, he died.
Now, maybe all of this is coincidence, but one thing is for sure.
They have a coven and they want my baby.
Certainly seems that way.
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.
I don't believe in witchcraft, but there are plenty of maniacs and crazy people in this city.
The doctor's name is Shand, you say?
N-No, Dr. Shand is one of these people.
The doctor's name is Sapirstein.
Abraham Sapirstein?
Yeah.
Do you know him?
I've met him once or twice.
To look at him, you'd never think he--
No, you wouldn't.
Not in a million years.
Would you like to go into Mount Sinai right now, this evening?
Yeah, I would love to.
Would that be possible?
It's difficult, but we'll try.
I want you to lie down and get some rest.
Yes.
Anything they've got, even a broom closet'd be fine.
I hope we can do better than that.
I'll see what I can do, then I'll check you over.
Oh, should I undress now?
No. It'll take me about a half-hour on the telephone.
You just lie down, rest.
O.K.?
O.K.
God bless Dr. Hill.
Everything's going to be O.K. now,
Andy or Jenny.
We're going to be in a nice, clean hospital with no visitors.
Oh.
Monsters.
Monsters.
Unspeakable.
Unspeakable.
I was sleeping.
Come with us quietly,
Rosemary.
Don't argue or make a scene because if you say anything more about witches or witchcraft, we're going to be forced to take you to a mental hospital.
You don't want that, do you?
So put your shoes on.
Wejust want to take you home.
No one's going to hurt you.
Or the baby.
Put your shoes on.
She's fine now.
We're going to go home and rest.
That's all it takes.
Thank you for your trouble,
Doctor.
Glad I could be of help, sir.
It's a shame you had to come in here.
Good evening,
Mrs. Woodhouse.
Mrs. Woodhouse!
Mrs. Woodhouse!
Uhh!
Ro!
Ro!
Ro!
Ro, baby, Ro!
Ro!
Come on, open up, Ro.
Go to hell!
Come on, honey.
No one's going to hurt you.
You promised them the baby, get out!
No, I didn't promise them anything.
What are you talking about?
Promised who?
Rosemary, you're--
You, too! Get away!
Hello.
Elise?
Mrs. Dunstan is out.
-Who is this?
-The babysitter.
Do you know where she went?
They went to the movies.
This is Rosemary.
Please ask her to call Rosemary the second she gets home.
It's terribly urgent.
Don't-- Don't forget.
Don't worry.
I'll tell her.
Thank you.
We don't want to hurt you, Ro.
We're your friends,
Rosemary.
There's nothing to be afraid of,
Rosemary.
Honest and truly there isn't.
This is nothing but a mild sedative to calm you down.
You know I wouldn't let any--
Ro.
Aah!
Ro, Ro!
Help me!
Oh, Ro, baby.
Somebody help me!
Aah!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute now.
We happen to be in labor here.
Here?
Here.
You're all right, baby.
You're going to be perfectly all right.
I swear to God you will.
There were supposed to be doctors, hospitals!
Doctors, hospitals!
Everything--
Everything's clean and sterile!
No, she isn't here, Elise.
I'll have her call you back.
Oh, Andy...
Andy or Jenny...
I--I'm sorry, my little darling.
Forgive me.
Hi.
Hi.
Is it all right?
Yes, it's fine.
What is it?
A boy.
Really?
A boy?
And it's all right?
Yes.
Where is it?
Ohh!
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, gee, what a start you gave me.
My goodness.
The baby, where is it?
Oh, uh, you wait here one minute.
Where's my baby?
Uh, I'll go find Dr. Abe.
Ju-Just wait.
Where's the baby?
Where is it?
Honey...
There were complications,
Rosemary, but nothing that will affect future births.
It's...
Dead.
It was in the wrong position.
In the hospital
I might have been able to do something about it, but you wouldn't listen.
Honey, we can have others as soon as you're better. I promise you.
Absolutely. You can start on another in a very few months.
As soon as you're better.
No.
I don't believe you.
You're both lying.
You're lying!
It didn't die!
You took it!
You're lying!
You're witches!
You're lying!
You're lying!
You're lying!
You're lying!
Abe says it's called pre-partum.
I don't know.
It's some kind of a hysteria.
Boy, you were really kapow, out of your mind.
Uh, I know where you got the idea that Minnie and Roman were witches, but, um, how come you thought that Abe and I joined the party?
Um, let's face it, darling.
You had the pre-partum crazies.
Now you're going to rest, and you're going to get over them.
I know this is the worst thing that ever happened to you, but from now on, everything's going to be roses.
Paramount's within an inch of where we want them, and suddenly Universal's interested, too, and we're going to blow this town, and we're going to be in the beautiful Hills of Beverly with a pool, a spice garden, the whole schmeer, and the kids, too, Ro.
Scout's honor.
You heard what Abe said.
Now, I got to run now and get famous.
Let me see your shoulder.
Let me see your shoulder.
Are you kidding?
Your left shoulder.
All right.
Anything you say.
I generally prefer doing this to music.
Left shoulder.
Right shoulder.
And that's as far as I go without a blue light.
The high pressure area that we see here has been causing this extreme heat and humidity.
And unfortunately will be staying with us city dwellers through the rest of the week.
It will be hot and over cast upstate New York as well with the possibility of thunder showers tonight and tomorrow withg radual clearing by tomorrow night.
All you people leaving the city this upcoming weekend should find it hot.
Do you hear a baby crying?
Why, no, I don't, dear.
Now, you come and get into your bed now.
It's time for you to take your pill.
Did you turn the air conditioner off?
Mm-hmm.
Well, you mustn't do that, dear.
Why, people are actually dying, it's so hot.
What do you do with the milk?
Why, uh, throw it away.
Your pill, Rosemary.
Hello, girls.
Whew. 95 out.
Some new people moved on in up in 8.
Do they have a baby?
How'd you know that?
I heard it crying.
Oh, wait a minute.
Oh, no.
Don't do that.
Why not?
Uh, a little messy, that's all.
Easy, easy.
Got her too high.
Not if he's still waiting for a plane, he isn't.
Oh, hell, now, Hayato.
You're just making fun of me.
You're pulling my leg, like we say.
Aah!
Rosemary, go back to bed.
You know you're not supposed to be up and around.
Is the mother?
Uh, Rosemary--
Shut up. You're in Dubrovnik.
I don't hear you.
What have you done to it?
What have you done to its eyes?
He has his father's eyes.
What are you talking about?
Guy's eyes are normal.
What have you done to him, you maniacs?
Satan is his father, not Guy.
He came up from hell and begat a son of mortal woman.
Hail, Satan.
Hail, Satan.
Satan is his father, and his name is Adrian.
He shall overthrow the mighty and lay waste their temples.
He shall redeem the despised and wreak vengeance in the name of the burned and the tortured!
Hail, Adrian!
Hail, Adrian!
Hail, Satan!
Hail, Satan!
Hail, Satan!
He chose you out of all the world.
Out of all the women in the whole world, he chose you.
He arranged things because he wanted you to be the mother of his only living son.
His power is stronger than stronger!
His might shall last longer than longer!
Hail, Satan!
No!
It can't be!
No!
Go look at his hands.
And his feet.
Oh, God!
God is dead!
Satan lives!
The year is one!
- Hail, Satan!
- Hail, Satan!
The year is one, and God is done!
Oh, God!
The year is one!
Hail, Adrian!
Hail, Satan!
Why don't you help us out,
Rosemary?
Be a real mother to Adrian.
You don't have to join
If you don't want to.
Just be a mother to your baby.
Minnie and Laura-Louise are too old.
It's not right.
Think about it, Rosemary.
Oh, God!
Oh, shut up with your oh, Gods, or we'll kill you, milk or no milk.
You shut up.
Rosemary's his mother, so you show some respect.
Come, my friend.
Come see him.
Come see the child.
What would you like to drink?
They, uh, promised me you wouldn't be hurt, and you haven't been, really.
I mean, supposing you had the baby and you lost it.
Wouldn't that be the same?
And we're getting so much in return, Ro.
Oh, Guy, let me introduce you to Argyron Stavropoulos.
How proud you must be.
Is this the mother?
Why in the name of--
Here, drink this.
You'll feel a little better.
What's in it?
Tannis root?
Nothing's in it.
Just plain, ordinary Lipton's tea.
You drink it.
Get away from here.
Roman.
You're rocking him too fast.
Sit down.
Get her out of here.
Put her where she belongs.
You're rocking him too fast.
That's why he's crying.
Oh, mind your own business.
Let Rosemary rock him.
Go on, sit down with the others.
Let Rosemary rock him.
Well, she's liable to--
Sit down with the others,
Laura-Louise.
Rock him.
You're trying to get me to be his mother.
Aren't you his mother?
END
Hello, Mrs.
MacGruder. Hello, Miss Daniels.
Have you ever seen so many gulls? What do you suppose it is?
There must be a storm at sea.
That can drive them inland, you know.
I was hoping you'd be a little late. He hasn't arrived yet.
But you said 3:00. I know.
I know. I've been calling all morning.
Oh, Miss Daniels, you have no idea.
They are so difficult to get. Really, they are.
We have to get them from India when they're baby chicks, and then...
This one won't be a chick, will he?
Oh, no, certainly not. This will be a full-grown mynah bird.
- And he'll talk?
- Well, yes, of course he'll...
Well, no, you'll have to teach him to talk.
I guess maybe I'd better phone. They said 3:00.
Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call.
Would you mind waiting? Well, maybe you'd better deliver him.
Let me give you my address.
Oh, well, all right, but I'm sure they're on the way.
Would you mind if I called?
No. All right.
I wonder if you could help me. What?
I said, I wonder if you could help me.
Yes. What is it you're looking for, sir?
- Lovebirds
Lovebirds, sir? Yes. I understand there are different varieties.
Is that true? Well, yes, there are.
Well, these are for my sister for her birthday, and as she's only gonna be 11,
I wouldn't want a pair of birds... that were... too demonstrative.
I understand completely. At the same time, I wouldn't want them to be too aloof.
No, of course not.
Do you happen to have a pair of birds that are... just friendly?
Oh, I think so. Now, then, let me see.
Aren't those lovebirds?
No. Those are, uh... red birds.
I thought they were strawberry finches.
Yes. We call them that too.
Here we are. Lovebirds.
Those are canaries.
Doesn't this make you feel awful?
Doesn't what make me feel... Having all these poor, innocent creatures caged up like this?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop. I suppose not.
Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
Certainly. It's to protect the species.
Yes, that's important, especially during the molting season.
That's a particularly dangerous time.
Are they molting now? Oh, some of them are.
How can you tell?
Well, they... get a sort of hangdog expression.
Yes, I see. Well, what about the lovebirds?
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead?
We have some very nice canaries this week. All right.
All right. May I see it, please?
Oh! Oh!
What is it? Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh!
There we are.
Oh, there. Wonderful.
Back in your gilded cage, Melanie Daniels.
What did you say?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
How did you know my name? A little birdie told me.
Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.
Hey, wait a minute. I don't know you.
Ah, but I know you. How?
We met in court.
- We never met in court or anyplace else
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court. When?
Don't you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a window?
- I didn't break that window.
- Yes, but your little prank did.
The judge should've put you behind bars.
- What are you, a policeman
I merely believe in the law. And
I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
What do you call your lovebird story...
- I really wanted the lovebirds
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately... I recognized you when I came in.
I thought you might like to know what it's like to be on the other end of a gag.
What do you think of that? I think you're a louse.
I am. Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds.
I'll find something else. See you in court.
Who was that man? I have no idea.
They said the mynah bird would be here later this afternoon, if you care to come back.
No, you'd better send him. May
I use this phone? Why, certainly.
Daily News? It's Melanie
Daniels. Could you get me the City Desk?
Just a minute, Mrs. MacGruder.
Hello, Charlie. Melanie.
I want you to do a favor for me.
No, this is a small one.
Pressure you? Why, Charlie, darling, would I try to pressure you?
Would you call the
Department of Motor Vehicles for me?
Find out who owns this license plate:
W- J-H-0-0-3.
Yes, a California plate.
No. I'll stop off in a little while. Is Daddy in his office?
No, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Tell him I'll see him later.
Thank you, Charlie.
Do you have any lovebirds?
Well, no, not in the shop, but I can order them for you.
How soon? Well... Well, when would you want them?
Immediately. Well, I could probably have them here by tomorrow morning.
Would that be all right? That would be just fine.
Miss, is that for Mitch Brenner? Yes.
He's not home. That's all right.
He won't be back until Monday...
I mean, if those birds are for him.
Monday? Yes.
I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Well... Where did he go?
Bodega Bay. He goes there every weekend.
Bodega Bay. Where's that?
Up the coast, about
60 miles north of here.
Sixty mi... Oh!
It's an hour and a half by freeway, or two hours if you take the Coast Highway.
I'd look after them myself, but I'm going away too.
I'm awfully sorry.
Good morning. Good morning.
I wonder if you could help me. I'll try my best.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner. Yeah.
Do you know him? Yeah.
Where does he live?
Right here, Bodega Bay.
- Yes, I know, but where?
- Right across the bay there.
Where?
Now, see where I'm pointing? Yes.
See them two big trees across there?
On the other side of the bay? Yes. And the white house?
Yes. That's where the Brenners live.
The Brenners? Mr. And Mrs. Brenner?
No. Just Lydia and the two kids. The two kids?
Yeah, Mitch and the little girl.
Oh, I see. How do I get down there?
You follow the road around the bay, and that'll take you to their front door.
The front door. Is there a back road I can take?
No. That's the only road.
You see, I want to surprise them.
Oh.
I don't want them to see me arrive. Oh.
It's a surprise, you see.
Well, you could get yourself a boat and cut right across the bay to their dock.
Where would I get a boat?
Down by the Tides Restaurant.
- Did you ever handle an outboard boat?
- Of course.
- Want me to order one for you?
- Well, thank you.
What name? Daniels.
Okay.
I wonder if you could tell me... Yeah. Hold it a minute, please.
- The little girl's name?
- The little Brenner girl?
Yes. Uh, Alice, I think.
Harry, what's the Brenner girl's name?
- Lois. Alice, isn't it?
No, it's Lois.
- It's Alice.
Are you sure? Well, I'm not positive, if that's what you mean.
I need her exact name.
Oh, uh... Just hold on one more minute, please.
In that case, I'll tell you what you do.
Go straight through town till you see a little hotel on your left.
Then you turn right there. Now, you got that? Yes.
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school, and just beyond, a little house with a red mailbox.
That's where Annie
Hayworth, the schoolteacher, lives.
You ask her about the little
Brenner girl. Well, thank you.
Save yourself a lot of trouble. Name's Alice for sure.
Can I have the boat in about 20 minutes?
How much for the phone calls? Oh, it's nothing.
Thank you.
Who is it? Me.
Who's "me"?
Miss Hayworth? Yes.
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but... Yes?
The man at the post office sent me.
He said you could tell me the name of the Brenner girl.
Cathy? The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner. He seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
Which is why the mail never gets delivered to the right place in this town.
I'm sorry. Smoke? Thank you.
Did, uh... you want to see Cathy about something?
Well, not exactly.
Oh.
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
No, not really.
I've been wanting a cigarette for the last 20 minutes.
I just couldn't convince myself to stop.
This tilling of the soil can become compulsive, you know.
It's a very pretty garden.
Oh, thank you. Well, it's something to do in your spare time.
There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.
Are, uh, you planning on staying long?
No, just a few hours. Then you're leaving after you see Cathy.
Well, something like that.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Actually, it's none of my business.
Well, I better be on my way.
Thank you very much. Not at all.
Did you drive up from San
Francisco by the coast road? Yes.
Nice drive. It's very beautiful.
Is that where you met Mitch?
Yes.
I guess that's where everyone meets Mitch.
Now you sound a bit mysterious, Miss Hayworth.
Do I?
I don't mean to. Actually,
I'm an open book, I'm afraid.
Or, rather, a closed one.
- Oh, pretty. What are they?
- Lovebirds.
I see. Good luck, Miss Daniels.
Thank you. Can I get out this way?
Go right around. It'll take you back to the main road.
Thank you.
Do you have a boat for
Miss Daniels? Yes, ma'am.
It's the one right below.
Are you all right? Yes, I think so.
What made it do that? That's the damnedest thing I ever saw.
It seemed to swoop down at you deliberately. Oh, you're bleeding too.
Let's take care of that. Okay?
That's a girl.
Come on.
What happened, Mitch?
Gull hit her. A gull?
Oh. Let's try up at the restaurant, all right?
Might need a tetanus shot. I had a booster before I went abroad last May.
What happened? Hello,
Deke. Young lady cut herself.
Shall I call a doctor? I don't think it's that serious. Let's see.
Helen, get some cotton and antiseptic.
Um, you cut yourself outside, miss?
Don't worry, Deke. She did it in a boat.
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once. Sued me before
I could bat an eyelash.
I don't think Miss Daniels is gonna sue anybody. Here.
Well, you're the lawyer. Thank you.
What's that? Just some peroxide.
I'll clean out the cut.
So you're a lawyer.
That's right. Of course, I usually defend people, but if I were prosecuting...
Do you practice here? Uh-uh, San
Francisco. What are you doing up here?
What kind of law? Criminal.
Is that why you want to see everyone behind bars? Oh, not everyone.
Only violators and practical jokers. That's right.
Ow! Oh, sorry.
What are you doing up here?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
You mean, you came all this way to bring me those birds?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday.
Besides, I was coming up anyway. What for?
To see a friend of mine. Careful.
Oh, sorry. Uh... who's your friend?
Annie Hayworth, the schoolteacher.
Annie Hayworth.
Well, small world.
Yes.
How do you know Annie?
We went to school together... college.
Did you? Imagine that. How long are you staying up here?
The weekend.
Well, I think the bleeding's almost stopped. Why don't you hold that on...
So you came up to see Annie, huh? Yes.
I think you came up to see me. Now, why would I want to see you of all people?
I don't know, but you must've gone to a lot of trouble... to find out who I was and where I lived.
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's newspaper.
Besides, I was coming up anyway. I've already told you that.
You really like me, huh?
I loathe you. You have no manners. You're arrogant and conceited.
I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
- What did it say?
- None of your business.
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either.
I come all the way up here to...
You were coming up anyway, remember?
Mitch?
I thought I saw your car.
What are you doing in town?
I had to acknowledge a delivery. A what?
Mother, I'd like you to meet
Melanie Daniels.
Miss Daniels, my mother.
How do you do?
How do you do, Miss
Daniels? Acknowledge a what?
A delivery. Miss Daniels brought us some birds from San Francisco.
Oh. For Cathy for her birthday. Where is she?
Across at Brinkmeyer's. Miss Daniels is staying up here for the weekend.
So I've already invited her for dinner tonight.
Well, you did go to the trouble of bringing those birds.
Oh, I couldn't possibly.
You did say birds? Yes, lovebirds.
Oh, I see.
So we couldn't let you get away without thanking you in some small way.
And you haven't met Cathy, and you are staying the weekend.
Well, yes, but... You are, aren't you?
Certainly, but... Then it's all settled.
What time is dinner,
Mother? 7:00, the same as usual.
I'll pick you up. Where are you staying?
- With Annie, of course
Oh, of course. How stupid of me. A quarter of 7:00?
Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see.
Besides, I can find my own way.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
I'm sure. 7:00, then.
Maybe.
We'll be waiting for you. How's your head?
Much better, thank you.
A gull hit me, Mrs. Brenner, that's all.
Oh, hi. Did you find her all right? Yes, I did.
I was wondering...
Uh, that sign there.
Do you suppose I could have the room for just a single night?
I was planning on renting it for a longer time... I would appreciate it.
I've tried everywhere in town. They're all full.
Well, all right. Got your bags in the car?
Well, it's utilitarian, I'll say that.
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store.
I hadn't planned on staying very long.
Yes, I know. Did something unexpected come up?
Yes. May I use your phone? I'd like to call home.
I just put some coffee on the stove.
Don't they ever stop migrating?
Hi!
Hi!
Miss Daniels? Yes.
Oh, they're beautiful!
They're just what I wanted. Is there a man and a woman?
I can't tell which is which. Well, I suppose so.
Hello there. Annie had no plans, huh? No.
We're very glad you could come. Are you hungry?
Reasonably. Dinner's just about ready.
We've been looking at the chickens.
Something seems to be wrong with them.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens.
I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now. What good's that gonna do?
The chickens won't eat.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
Caveat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware. Whose side are you on?
Merely quoting the law, dear. Never mind the law.
This won't take long, Miss
Dan... Hello, Fred? Lydia Brenner.
I didn't interrupt your dinner, did I? How about a drink?
I'd love one. That feed you sold me is no good.
The chicken feed. Well, it's just no good. The chickens won't eat it.
They're always hungry.
I opened a sack for them when I got home, and they just wouldn't touch it.
You know chickens as well as
I do, and when they won't eat, there's something wrong with what they're being fed.
No, they're not fussy chickens.
Who? What's he got to do with it?
Is that your father?
Mm-hmm. Please sit down.
I don't care how many sacks of feed you sold him. My chicken...
Oh, I see.
Dan Fawcett.
This afternoon? That proves what
I'm saying. The feed you sold us...
Oh.
Well, maybe I better go over and see him.
You don't think there's something going around, do you?
No, never!
No, they don't seem sick at all. They just won't eat.
Uh-huh.
Well, I'll try to go over and see him. Maybe he...
Uh-huh. All right.
Thanks.
He had a call from
Dan Fawcett a while ago.
His chickens won't eat either.
It's what you said, Mom. Mr.
Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
No, Cathy. He sold Mr.
Fawcett a different brand.
You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds. Your brother told me.
Then you knew Mitch in
San Francisco? Is that right?
No, not exactly.
Mitch knows a lot of people in San
Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
- Cathy!
- Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.
He's spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial.
Your brother's practice... Aw, Mom, please!
I know all that democracy jazz. They're still hoods.
He has a client now who shot his wife in the head six times.
Six times! Can you imagine it?
I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?
Why did he shoot her?
- He was watching a ball game on television
- What?
- His wife changed the channel.
Are you coming to my party tomorrow? I don't think so.
I have to get back to San Francisco.
Don't you like us?
Oh, darling, of course I do.
Don't you like Bodega
Bay? I don't know yet.
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city.
He says San Francisco's like an anthill at the foot of a bridge.
I suppose it does get hectic at times.
Well, if you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it.
It's supposed to be a surprise party.
They've got this whole complicated thing figured out... where I'm going to
Michele's for the afternoon, and Michele's mother will say that she has a headache, would I mind if she took me home.
Then when I get home here, all the kids'll jump out!
Oh, won't you come?
Won't you please come?
I don't think so.
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch? Hmm? Yes.
Certainly pretty. Mm-hmm.
How long have you known her?
- Now, I told you, dear, we met yesterday
In a bird shop. In a bird shop.
She was selling birds?
No, no. I just led her into believing that I believed she was, and then...
It's all very complicated. But she did buy the lovebirds and then drove all the way here.
Mother. Yes?
Where did you go to law school?
Forgive me.
I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.
She's very rich, isn't she?
Yeah, I suppose so. Her father's part owner of one of the big newspapers.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print.
She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch. Yes, I know.
She is the one who jumped into a fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Yes.
I supposed I'm old-fashioned. I know it was supposed to be very warm there, but...
Well, actually the newspapers said she was naked. Yes, I know, dear.
It's none of my business, but when you bring a girl like that...
Darling? Yes?
I think I can handle
Melanie Daniels by myself.
Well... as long as you know what you want, Mitch.
I know exactly what I want.
Be able to find your way back all right? Oh, yes.
Will I be seeing you again? San
Francisco's a long way from here.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week with a lot of time on my hands.
I'd like to see you. Maybe we could go swimming or something.
Mother tells me you like to swim.
How does Mother know what I like to do? We read the same gossip column.
Oh, that... Rome. I really like to swim. We might get along very well.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Without any clothes on?
With all my clothes on. The newspaper that ran that story... happens to be a rival of my father's paper.
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstances? I'm neither poor nor innocent.
The truth of that particular... The truth is, you're running around with a pretty wild crowd.
Yes, that's the truth, but I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth too.
Uh-huh. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
No. At least I didn't until I came up here.
So you didn't go to school together? No.
And you didn't come here to see her? No!
You were lying! Yes, I was lying.
What about the letter you wrote me?
Is that a lie? No, I wrote the letter.
- Well, what did it say?
- It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner.
I think you need these lovebirds after all. They may help your personality."
That's what it said. But you tore it up?
Yes. Why?
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
- Like jumping into a fountain in Rome.
- I told you what happened!
You don't expect me to believe that, do you?
I don't give a damn what you believe!
- I'd still like to see you.
- Why?
I think it might be fun.
That might've been good enough in
Rome, but it's not good enough now.
It is for me. Well, not for me.
- What do you want?
- I thought you knew.
I want to go through life... jumping into fountains naked. Good night.
Miss Daniels, is that you? Yes.
Hi.
Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
- Would you like some brandy?
- If you have some, I'd love it.
I'll get it. Why don't you sit down.
Oh, would you like a sweater or something, a quilt?
No. No, thank you.
Won't you call me Melanie?
All right.
Thank you. Gets a bit chilly here at night sometimes, especially if you're over near the bay.
Well, how did your evening go?
Did you meet Lydia?
Or would you rather
I changed the subject?
I think so.
Well, how do you like our little hamlet?
- I despise it
I suppose it doesn't offer much to the casual visitor, unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside.
It takes a bit of getting used to.
Where are you from originally? San Francisco.
How did you happen to come up here?
A friend invited me up for a weekend a long time ago.
Look, I see no reason for being coy about this.
It was Mitch Brenner. I guess you knew that anyway. I suspected as much.
Well, you needn't worry.
It's been over and done with a long time ago.
Annie, there's nothing between
Mr. Brenner and me. Isn't there?
Well, maybe there isn't.
Maybe there's never been anything between Mitch and any girl.
What do you mean?
I think I'll have some of that.
I was seeing a lot of him in San Francisco.
One weekend, he invited me up to meet Lydia.
When was this?
- Oh, four years ago, shortly after his father died
Of course, things may be different now. Different?
With Lydia.
Did she seem a trifle distant? Mm, a trifle.
Well, then perhaps things aren't quite so different.
You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy.
When I got back to San Francisco,
I spent days trying to figure out... what I'd done to displease her.
- Well, what had you done?
- Nothing.
I simply existed. So what's the answer? A jealous woman, right?
A clinging, possessive mother?
Wrong. With all due respect to
Oedipus, I don't think that was the case.
Then what was it?
Lydia liked me. That's the strange part.
Now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
- Then why did she object to you?
- Because she was afraid.
- Afraid you'd take Mitch?
- Afraid I'd give Mitch.
I don't understand.
Afraid of any woman who would give Mitch the one thing Lydia can give him: Love.
That adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
No, I don't think so.
You see, she's not afraid of losing Mitch.
She's only afraid of being abandoned.
- Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
No. She already has a daughter.
Well, what about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
Well, I can understand his position.
He'd just been through a lot with Lydia after his father died.
He didn't want to risk going through it all again.
- Oh, I see
So it ended. Not right then, of course.
We went back to San Francisco, saw each other now and then, but we both knew it was over.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
- I wanted to be near Mitch
Oh, it was over and done with, and I knew it, but...
I still wanted to be near him.
I still like him a hell of a lot, and I don't want to lose that friendship... ever.
Hello.
No, no, no, I wasn't asleep.
Yes, just a little while ago.
Sure. Hold on.
It's Mitch.
For you.
Hello? Oh, yes, this is Melanie.
Fine, thank you.
No, no trouble at all. I simply followed the road.
Well... There's no need to apologize.
I can understand...
That's very kind of you. No, I'm not angry.
Well, I couldn't. I have to get back to San Francisco.
No, I wouldn't want to disappoint Cathy, but...
I see.
All right. Yes, I'll be there.
Good night, Mitch.
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon. I said I would.
It should be fun.
I'll be there, too, to help.
Oh, it seems so pointless.
Well, I think I'll go to sleep. It's been a busy day.
My luggage.
That's pretty. Where'd you get that? Brinkmeyer's?
Mm-hmm. Do you think I should go?
Well, that's up to you.
No, it's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
- Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
- Yes.
- Then go.
- Thank you, Annie.
Oh. Wonder who that can be.
Is someone there?
Who is it? Look.
Poor thing. Probably lost his way in the dark.
But it isn't dark, Annie.
There's a full moon.
Cathy, that's very good. Very good.
Okay. Here we go.
Attagirl. Come on.
Don't let him get you.
No, I really shouldn't have any more. I'm driving.
Well, actually, I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. A lot of roast beef left over.
No, I couldn't possibly.
I... have to get back. All right.
Cheers. Cheers.
Why do you have to rush off?
What's so important in San Francisco?
Well, I have to get to work tomorrow, for one thing.
You have a job? I have several jobs.
What do you do? I do different things on different days.
Like what?
Well, on Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid at the airport.
Helping travelers?
No, misdirecting them. I thought you could read my character.
On Tuesdays, I take a course in
General Semantics at Berkeley... finding new four-letter words.
- That's not a job, of course...
- You mean, you don't have to...
And on Thursdays, I have my meeting and lunch.
- In the underworld, I suppose
I shall disappoint you.
We're sending a little
Korean boy through school.
We actually raise money for it.
You see, Rome...
That entire summer, I did nothing but...
Well, it was very easy to get lost there.
So when I came back, I thought it was time I began...
I don't know... finding something again.
So, on Mondays and
Thursdays, I keep myself busy.
- What about Fridays?
- Fridays? They're free.
I sometimes go to bird shops on Fridays.
I'm very glad you do.
A nice, innocent, little day.
Oh, yes.
I have an Aunt Tessa.
Have you got an Aunt Tessa?
- Mm-mm
Mine is very prim and straight-laced.
I'm giving her a mynah bird when she comes back from Europe.
Mynah birds talk, you know.
Can you see my Aunt Tessa's face... when this one tells us one or two of the words I've picked up at Berkeley?
You need a mother's care, my child.
- Not my mother's.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
What have you got to be sorry about?
My mother? Don't waste your time.
She ditched us when I was 11 and ran off with some hotel man in the East.
You know what a mother's love is?
- Yes, I do.
- You mean it's better to be ditched?
No. I think it's better to be loved. Don't you ever see her?
I don't know where she is.
Well, maybe I ought to go join the other children.
All right. Here we go. One... two... three.
There you go.
Look! Look!
Hey! No touching allowed!
Oh!
Help me get the children into the house.
There you go.
Have they gone, Mitch?
I think so. Is anyone hurt?
Jenny got a scratch down her cheek, but it's nothing.
That makes three times.
Mitch, this isn't usual, is it?
The gull when I was in the boat yesterday, the one at Annie's last night...
Last night? What do you mean?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door. Mitch, what's happening?
L... I don't know. Do you have to go back to Annie's?
No. I have my things in the car.
Stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better.
Would you like some mustard with that? No, thank you.
Why didn't Annie stay? Said something about going home to take a call from her sister.
What's the matter with them?
What's the matter with all the birds? Where did you want this coffee?
Here on the table, honey.
Hurry up with yours, Mitch.
I'm sure Miss Daniels wants to be on her way.
I think you ought to stay the night, Melanie.
We have an extra room upstairs and everything.
That road can be a pretty bad one at night.
If I go across to Santa Rosa, I'll come out on the freeway much earlier, won't I?
Yes, and the freeway is much quicker.
But she'll be hitting all the heavy traffic going back to San Francisco.
Just listen to those lovebirds.
Mitch.
Cover your faces! Cover your eyes!
That's a sparrow, all right.
We know what it is, Al. Did you have a light burnin' or somethin'?
Yes, but there wouldn't have been that much light going up the chimney.
Sometimes birds are attracted by light. Sure is a peculiar thing.
All right, but we've got to do something about it!
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Well, the birds invaded the house.
What's more likely... they got in the room and just panicked.
I'll admit a bird will panic in an enclosed room, but they didn't just get in: :
They came in, right down the chimney.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once. Tell him about the party.
We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy, for her birthday.
How old is she? Eleven!
In the middle of the party, some seagulls came down at the children!
Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull yesterday.
Yeah. Were the kids bothering the birds or something?
If you make any kind of a disturbance near them, they'll come after you.
Al, the children were playing a game. Those gulls attacked.
Now, Lydia, "attack" is a pretty strong word, don't you think?
I mean, birds just don't go around attacking people without no reason.
The kids probably scared 'em, that's all.
These birds attacked.
You got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.
Maybe you ought to put some screen on top of your chimney.
You want help cleaning up? No. I can handle it.
It shouldn't be too much of a job.
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
I think I should stay, don't you?
It would be nice if you could.
My things are in the car. Do you want to go with me? All right.
Well, anything else I can do, Mitch? No thanks, Al.
We'll be all right. Good night, Lydia.
Sure is peculiar.
Mitch. Mitch. Mitch!
Yes, Mother? I'm going to drop Cathy off now.
I'll probably drive over to the Fawcett farm.
Okay.
Mornin'.
Good morning, George.
Is Mr. Fawcett around?
I think so, ma'am. Ain't seen him this morning, but he ought to be in there.
Thanks.
Dan, are you home?
Uh...
Uh...
Mother!
What is it, dear? What's the matter?
Oh!
Al Malone, the deputy, just called.
He wants me over at the Fawcett place.
Some detectives from
Santa Rosa will be there.
Will it be all right? Yes. I was just taking your mother in some tea.
Oh, be careful, please.
And you be careful?
Mitch?
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner.
I thought you might like some tea. Oh. Thank you.
Where's Mitch? Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
He was calling from the farm.
Then he saw. Oh, he must have.
They sent for the Santa Rosa police.
What good will they do?
Do you think Cathy's all right at the school?
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Do I sound very foolish to you?
Oh, no.
I keep seeing Dan's face.
And they have such big windows at the school.
All the windows are broken in Dan's bedroom.
All the windows! Try not to think about that.
I wish I were a stronger person.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.
It's terrible how you... you depend on someone else for strength, and then... suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.
I'd love to be able to relax sometime.
I'd love to be able to sleep.
- Do you think Cathy's all right?
- Annie's there.
She'll be all right.
I'm not like this, you know? N
- Not usually.
I don't fuss and fret about my children.
When Frank died...
You see, he understood the children. He really understood them.
He had the knack of entering into their world, of becoming part of them.
That's a very rare talent. Yes.
Oh, I wish, I wish... I wish I could be like that.
I miss him.
Sometimes, even now, I wake up in the morning and I think,
"I must get Frank's breakfast."
And I get up, and there's a very good reason for getting out of bed, until of course...
I remember.
I miss talking to him.
Cathy's a child, of course, and Mitch...
Well, Mitch has his own life.
I'm glad he stayed here today.
I- I feel safer with him here.
Would you like to rest now? No.
No, don't go.
I feel as if I don't understand you at all, and I...
I want so much to understand.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Because my son seems to be very fond of you.
And I don't quite know how I feel about it.
I don't even know if I like you or not.
Is that so important, your liking me?
Well, yes. I think so.
Mitch is important to me.
I want to like whatever girl he chooses.
And perhaps if you don't?
Well, then I don't think it'll matter much to anyone but me.
Oh, I think it would also matter to Mitch.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.
But, you see, I-I don't want to be left alone.
I don't think I could bear to be left alone!
Oh, forgive me.
This business with the birds has upset me, I...
I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner?
I wish I was stronger.
Do you think she's all right?
Do you think she's all right at the school?
- Would you like me to go for her?
- Oh, I-I couldn't ask it.
- Oh, I don't mind, really.
- Would you?
- I'd feel so much better.
- I'll go right now.
Melanie?
Thanks for the tea.

All right, children. Now, please put your song books away, then stand up alongside your desks.
We'll go out for recess as soon as everybody gets ready.
We are not going into the playground... until everybody has quieted down.
Close that door. Quickly. Please. What?
What is it? Look.
We've got to get the children out of here.
Shh, shh, shh! All right, children. Now, quiet.
Quiet. Miss Daniels would like to see... how we conduct ourselves during a fire drill.
I would like you to show her how quiet and obedient you can be.
Oh, uh, we're going out of school now.
- Leave school
We want those of you who live nearby to go directly home.
Home?
I want the rest of you to go down the hill all the way to the hotel. Is that clear?
Yes, Miss Hayworth.
Melanie?
I want you to go as quietly as possible.
Do not make a sound until I tell you to run.
Then run as quickly as you can. Now, does everybody understand?
Yes, Miss Hayworth.
All right, John, you lead the way.
Cathy! Cathy!
Well, Daddy, there were hundreds of them.
No, I'm not hysterical. I'm trying to tell you this as calmly as I know how.
All right, Daddy. Yes, Daddy.
Well, just now. Not 15 minutes ago.
At the school.
No, I don't. Just a minute.
What's the name of the school?
- Just the Bodega Bay School.
- The Bodega Bay School.
Well, I don't know how many children... 30 or 40.
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school.
Help you, Mrs. Bundy? I need some change, Mr. Carter.
Crows, I think.
Well, I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss. Thank you.
They're different, Daddy.
Well, I think these were crows.
Well, yes. Hundreds of them.
Yes, they attacked the children. Attacked them!
Well, I don't know when, but I simply can't leave now, Daddy.
All right. Yes. Good-bye.
They're both perching birds, of course. But quite different species.
The crow is Corvus brachyrhynchos, and the blackbird is
Euphagus cyanocephalos.
Thank you.
You have the number at the Fawcett farm? Right here in this book, miss.
I can't see that it makes any difference, Mrs. Bundy.
Crows or blackbirds, if the school was attacked, that's pretty serious.
I hardly think that either species... would have sufficient intelligence to launch a massed attack.
Their brainpans are not big enough to...
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know anything about their brainpans, but...
Well, I do. I do know.
Ornithology happens to be my avocation.
Birds are not aggressive creatures, miss.
They bring beauty into the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
Sam! Three southern fried chicken.
Baked potato on all of them.
Yes, may I speak to
Mitch Brenner, please?
Yes, I'll wait. It is mankind, rather, who insists upon... making it difficult for life to exist upon this planet.
Now, if it were not for birds... Mrs.
Bundy, you don't seem to understand.
This young lady said there was an attack on the school.
Impossible! Oh, Mitch?
Oh, I'm glad I caught you. Something terrible has ha...
It's the end of the world!
Two Bloody Marys, Deke.
What actually happened at the school? Bunch of crows... attacked the school kids.
It's the end of the world.
"Thus saith the Lord God...
"unto the mountains and the hills, and the rivers and the valleys.
"Behold I, even I...
"shall bring a sword upon you.
And I will devastate your high places."
Ezekiel, chapter six.
"Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink."
Isaiah, chapter five.
It's the end of the world.
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
These weren't a few birds. I didn't know there were many crows... in Bodega Bay this time of year.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range.
In fact, during our
Christmas count, we recorded...
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes?
There are several varieties.
The ones who've been playing devil with my fishing boats.
- Have you had trouble with gulls?
- One of my boats did, last week.
This young lady was hit by a gull only Saturday.
Deke, I'm still waiting for those Bloody Marys. Comin'right up.
Could you ask them to lower their voices, please? They're frightening the children.
A whole flock of gulls nearly capsized one of my boats.
Practically tore the skipper's arm off.
You're scaring the kids. Keep it low. All right.
Yeah, but he's scarin' me, too.
Are you tryin' to say that all these...
Nah, that sounds impossible, Sebastian.
Deke, look, I'm just tellin' you what happened to one of my boats.
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes.
Really, let's be logical about this.
What were the crows after at the school?
What do you think they were after? Miss, uh...
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
- For what purpose?
- To kill them.
- Why?
- I don't know why.
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet, Miss Daniels,
Since archeopteryx,
140 million years ago.
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time... to start a... a war against humanity?
No one called it a war.
Scotch, light on the water.
You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
Who said anything about a war? All I said, some gulls...
Want some more coffee? No.
...came down on one of my boats.
They could have been after the fish, just like you said.
- The Captain should have shot at them.
- Huh?
Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most birds are.
Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the Earth!
That would hardly be possible.
- Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
Because there are 8,650 species... of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter.
It is estimated that
5,750,000,000 birds... live in the United States alone.
The five continents of the world...
Kill 'em all. Get rid of the messy animals.
...probably contain more than 100 billion birds.
It's the end of the world.
- Those gulls must have been after the fish
Of course! Hurry up, children. Finish your lunch.
Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy?
Hell, maybe we're all getting a little carried away by this.
Admittedly, a few birds did act strange, but that's no reason to believe that...
I keep telling you, this isn't a few birds. These are gulls, crows, swifts...
I have never known birds of different species to flock together.
The very concept is unimaginable.
Why, if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance!
How could we possibly hope to fight them?
We couldn't, you're right. You're right, Mrs. Bundy.
What's the matter?
Somethin' wrong out here?
- We're fighting a war, Sam
A war? Against who?
Against birds!
- I'm glad you all think this is so amusing
You've frightened the children half out of their wits. If the young lady said... she saw the attack at a school, why don't you believe her?
What attack? Who attacked the school? Birds did. Crows.
You're all sitting around here debating!
What do you want them to do next? Crash through that window?
Mommy! Ssh. Put on your coat.
Why don't you all go home, lock your doors and windows?
What's the fastest way to San Francisco?
- The freeway, ma'am
How do I find it?
- I'm goin'out that way, lady. You can follow me
- Well then, let's leave now.
- Haven't finished my drink yet.
I got here as fast as
I could. Where's Cathy?
She's with Annie. She's all right.
Al, why aren't you over at the school,
Where the attack was?
- 'Cause I just got back from Dan Fawcett's place
- He was killed last night by birds.
- What?
Hold it, you don't know that for a fact.
What are the facts?
- The Santa Rosa Police think it's a felony murder
They think a burglar broke in and killed him.
How do they explain the dead birds all over the floor?
Santa Rosa Police figure they got in after the old man was killed.
Were the Santa Rosa
Police at your school today?
- Are you coming?
- Now take it easy, lady.
There isn't a bird anywhere in sight!
"Look at the birds of the air. They do not sow or reap.
Yet your Heavenly Father feeds them."
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year.
The town was just covered with seagulls.
- Please finish your drink.
- That's right, sir. I recall it.
A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog, and headed into the town where all the lights were.
They made some mess, too, smashing into buildings and everything.
They always make a mess. The point is that no one seemed to be upset about it.
They were all gone next morning, just as though nothing at all had happened.
- Poor things.
- I'm leaving! Are you coming?
All right, all right!
Well, hope you folks figure this thing out!
It's the end of the world!
I better get back to the cannery. What do I owe you, Deke?
S- Sebastian, hold it a minute. Huh?
I- I don't want to be an alarmist, but... No one ever said you were
I think we're in real trouble. I don't know how this started, or why, but I know it's here and we'd be crazy to ignore it.
To ignore what? The "bird war"? Yes, the "bird war. "
The bird attack, plague... Call it what you like, they're massing out there someplace, and they'll be back.
Ridiculous. C- Come here.
Unless we do something right now, unless we get Bodega
Bay on the move, they...
Look, Mitch.
Even if... Even if this is true, even if all the birds...
Don't you believe it's true? No, Mitch, frankly I don't.
There's no reason I... Well, it's happening. Isn't that a reason?
I like Bodega Bay as well as the next man... Fine, then help me.
You're an important man.
If you help, they all will.
Help how? What do you want to do?
Mrs. Bundy said something about Santa Cruz.
About seagulls getting lost in a fog and flying in towards the lights.
We don't have fog this time of year! Make our own fog!
How do you figure to do that? We can use smoke pots, the way the Army uses them.
Look!
They're attacking again.
Melanie, you stay in here. Come on, Al!
Look out!
Look at the gas. That man's lighting a cigar!
Hey, you! Watch out!
Don't drop that match!
- Get out of there!
- Mister, run!
Hey!
Why are they doing this?
Why are they doing this?
They said when you got here, the whole thing started!
Who are you? What are you?
Where did you come from?
I think you're the cause of all this.
I think you're evil! Evil!
Oh, God!
I think they're going!
We can get Cathy at Annie's now.
The crows again. Shh!
Come on.
Oh, no. Stay here. S
- Stay here.
Cathy! Where's Cathy?
Mitch, don't!
Oh, don't leave her there, Mitch.
Oh!
Come on.
Shh.
Wh-When we got back from taking Michele home... we-we heard the explosion and we went... we went outside to see what it was.
All-All at once the... the birds were everywhere!
All at once she pushed me inside... and they covered her!
Annie... She pushed me inside!
Give me another one, darling.
How long have they been gathering there?
Oh, about 15 minutes.
Seems like a pattern, doesn't it?
They strike, then disappear, and then start massing again.
Doesn't look so very different, does it?
A little smoke hanging over the town, otherwise...
You want to try your father again?
No, I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Still got power, haven't we? Yes.
Mitch, I'm getting something on the radio.
Come on.
I can't get any of the local stations.
I think this is San Francisco.
"...and the work of a team of professionals. " End quote.
In Bodega Bay early this morning, a large flock of crows... attacked a group of children who were leaving the school during a fire drill.
One little girl was seriously injured and taken to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but the majority of children reached safety.
We understand there was another attack on the town, but this information is rather sketchy.
So far, no word has come through... to show if there have been further attacks.
On the national scene today, in Washington...
Well, is that all?
I'll have to get some more water. Mustn't let this fire go out.
Did you get the windows in the attic, Mitch? Yes, I got 'em all, dear.
When do you think they'll come? I don't know.
If there are bigger birds,
Mitch, they'll get into the house.
Well, it's just a chance we'll have to take. Maybe we ought to leave.
No, not now! Not when they're massing out there.
When? W
- We'll just see what happens.
Where will we go? L
- I don't know. I think we're safe here for the time being
Let's get the wood in now. What happens when you run out of wood?
I don't know! We'll break up the furniture. You don't know!
You don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead!
If only your father were here...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mitch.
Make yourself some coffee, won't you?
"In assuming the tasks of the presidency,
I said that few generations..."
Where are they heading? Somewhere inland.
Santa Rosa? Maybe.
Come on. Let's get the wood.
Mitch? Can I bring the lovebirds in here?
- No
But, Mom, they're in a cage. They're birds, aren't they?
Let's leave them in the kitchen, huh, honey?
Mitch, why are they doing this, the birds?
We don't know, honey. Why are they trying to kill people?
I wish I could say.
I- I'm sick, Melanie.
I want to... I'll go with you.
They're going.
Mitch?
Oh, Mitch!
Melanie! Melanie!
Oh, poor thing! Poor thing!
Listen, get some water, bandages and antiseptic. Quickly!
Bandages. It's terrible.
Cathy, get some brandy.
No, no, no! No, no, it's all right.
No, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
It's all right. It's all right. No.
No. Shh! Shh!
Cathy, get the lamp.
We've got to get her to a hospital.
We can't, Mitch. There's no place we can go. There's San Francisco.
We'd never make it. We have to try.
We'll go by way of Bay Hill Road.
Then we don't have to go through town.
We can't stay here. She needs help!
I'm frightened. Terribly frightened.
I don't know what's outside there.
We better get started before another attack comes.
We'll take Melanie's car.
That'll be faster than the truck.
Can you finish the bandaging? I'll try.
All right.
Mitch? See if you can get anything on the car radio.
The bird attacks have subsided for the time being.
Bodega Bay seems to be the center, though there are reports... of minor attacks on
Sebastopol and a few on Santa Rosa.
Bodega Bay has been cordoned off by roadblocks.
Most of the townspeople have managed to get out, but there are still some isolated pockets of people.
No decision has been arrived at yet as to what the next step will be, but there's been some discussion as to whether the military should go in.
It appears that the bird attacks come in waves, with long intervals between.
The reason for this does not seem clear as yet.
Did you hear anything on the radio?
It's-lt's all right. Come on.
No. No!
Shh. Shh.
- Mitch?
- Shh!
Stay there.
Can I bring the lovebirds, Mitch?
They haven't harmed anyone.
A- All right. Bring them.
NARRATOR: Can death be outwitted?
Is the secret to of eternal life just around that corner?
Today medical science batches up mutilated bodies,
Transplanting human skin, eyes, limbs, even vital organs.
Is the next step the transplantation
Of the human brain?
Many scientists answer yes, but they pause and add
A grim warning, for in the ancient folk legends tales are
Told of blood sucking vampires, crawling out of graves
To live on the bodies of helpless victims.
Is man now doomed to produce a race of ever living
Monstrosities, worse than the vampires of legend?
Will ruthless men and women of great wealth and power,
Greedily buy or steal the bodies of the young and beautiful
So their brains may live on forever.
Such questions may seem fanciful,
But at this very moment, scientists
Are working on the answer to brain transplantation
And human bodies are used.
This girl was buried in a nearby cemetery yesterday.
Only a few hours ago her body was stolen by Dr. Otto Frank
And brought to this hidden laboratory.
He has grafted a living animal's grain
Into this newly dead body.
If the experiment works, the next step
Will be the transplantation of a human brain.
The brain cells are being reactivated
By an atomic fission produced the cyclotron.
Has he found a way to outwit death
Or has he created another...
[DRAMATIC MUSIC] Deep below,
Dr. Frank takes the chance of smashing
His way into a new sealed vault.
His experiments cannot continue without another body.
The watchman's mind was not on body
Snatchers, just his usual nip.
[SCREAM] Inside the vault a body waits.
This is one of the doctor's mistakes,
A monstrosity, an animal's brain grated to a human body.
Leaving the dead watchmen, the monstrosity
Carried the girl's body out of the vault.
It fears and obeys one master, Dr. Frank.
Here beneath the old mention, the doctor carefully
Prepared for another transplant.
This body had been in the vault for only a few hours.
Chances seemed better this time.
Still Dr. Frank was doubtful.
Tissue and dead bodies deteriorates rapidly.
Where were the live fresh bodies he had been promised.
He bitterly resents that every step forward
Depends on the whim of the minds of a woman
Brooding upstairs in her bedroom.
And Hetty March wonders has she been a fool squandering
Money on this strange experiment?
Money hoarded through a long, greedy lifetime, each day more
Money, each day death getting closer.
Ah, but to starts life again in a brand
New body, beautiful and young.
No price can be too high for that.
Can she really trust the doctor?
Can she really trust anyone?
Hasn't everyone tried to cheat her?
Wanting her money while they smile at her ugliness,
But they never got a penny.
Oh, how she made them sweat.
Especially this old fool, companion and gigolo.
How many years she's kept him dangling on promises.
While sometimes it's convenient to
Have him there, especially when he comes cheaper than servants.
The Austrian girl.
Nina Rhodes, 18, no family, pleasing personality... whatever
That might mean...
Thick ankles, pimply
Face, but she always when she's spoken to very likely.
Well, applications forms for a servant girl
Don't usually include bust, waist and hip measurements.
[RADIO ANNOUNCEMENT IN
BACKGROUND]
All three will be here tomorrow.
And then you can choose.
REPORTER (OVER RADIO):
Earlier this evening
At Greenhaven Cemetery, the body snatchers brutally murdered
Nightwatchman Robert Pain,
62, who evidently interrupted
His killers during their ghoulish tasks.
His neck was broken.
The imprint of a huge pair of hands was found on his throat.
It's the opinion of the police that the same gang
That has previously...
Ring for Dr. Frank. [BUZZER]
So that's what he was doing.
[MECHANICAL WHIRRING]
More of this hocus pocus, Hetty.
The doctor transplanted a brain from a live dog
To a live human body.
You saw the walk out of the cylinder alive.
How many failures since thin?
Still, it's your money.
The bodies must be fresh.
This specimen is excellent.
An the police are looking for the body snatcher.
Find a local cemetery doctor, are you
Trying to blaze a trail to our door?
The final test was essential for your protection.
As for the police if they come here, I hit the switch.
A nuclear reaction is set off.
And as a matter of minutes, this house and any evidence
It might contain becomes a radioactive hole in the grade.
Be careful.
We can wait for that until after your operation.
Nothing must go wrong.
There's no sign of live.
Watch.
She lacks but one thing, a brain.
Hans was still living when we dragged him from the car.
That's why we succeeded with the transplant.
She seems alive.
She is to a limited extent.
She'll be able to move around, but the brain deteriorization
Is too extensive with thought processes.
Pardon me, but how far is Hollywood from here?
All right, let's see.
16 kilometers, about 10 miles.
Which way?
That way.
Are you going to Hollywood?
No such luck.
I'm what's known as a foreign domestic.
The next 12 months,
I'll be scrubbing
Floors and making beds.
But when my time's up,
Hollywood look out.
That's strange.
A foreign domestic agency has paid my passage too.
I'm from Vienna, Austria.
Oh, really?
I'm from England.
No.
Is this your first trip?
Yes, I'm awfully excited.
Por favor, I no speak
English very good.
Are you going to work for Mrs. March too?
This sounds like a sister act.
You too?
Nina Rhodes?
Yes, sir.
Anita Gonzales?
Beatrice Mullins?
That's right.
Are you Mr. March?
No, I work for Mrs. March.
Come along.
NARRATOR: Three new bodies, fresh, live, young bodies.
No families and friends within thousands of miles,
No one to ask embarrassing questions when they disappear.
Victor wondered which
Mrs. March would pick,
The little Mexican, the girl from Vienna,
Or the buxom blonde.
Victor knew his favorite, but he still felt uneasy.
Making to an 80-year-old woman in the body
Of a 20-year-old girl is insanity.
Still, Hetty's plan to transfer her fortune to the new body
Had been brilliant.
Unpleasant to think about what's going to happen to these girls,
But a man has to consider his own future.
What would happen to him if Hetty
Were to cast him off after all these years.
VICTOR: Well, there's your new home, girls.
BEATRICE: Gives me the shivers.
Aren't there any neighbors?
No.
Are there any other servants?
No, but I don't think you're going to find it boring.
What a jolly little place this is.
[SCREAMS]
What was that?
No one's to leave this house without permission.
Hurry along.
Hurry up.
No go.
Put down your luggage.
Turn around slowly.
Get the doctor.
Get the doctor.
NARRATOR: As with the other bodies stolen from cemeteries,
The nerve endings of the brain were too far
Gone to receive a proper transplant.
The experiment had failed to produce anything more than a
Walking breathing zombie-like creature.
But the doctor permitted to wander about the laboratory.
She was quite harmless and at times even amusing.
Charming, isn't she?
Did you want something?
Mrs. March is waiting for you.
The girls have arrive.
She doesn't have a brain.
May be advantages.
I want them examined immediately.
Very well, this way.
Victor, the doctor can conduct the examination perfectly.
What an old spoil sport I am.
Have you disconnected the phone?
Can't I depend on you for anything?
Won't it be midnight when those girls start calling police,
Employment agencies, immigration authorities, consulates.
There will be no phone calls.
Hideous, she's useless.
There is one more test I should make.
Do anything you what with her.
The other two?
Perfect medical specimens.
All right, Anita, get dress now and wait for the others.
Mrs. March, I am now giving you notice.
I do not care to work in this house any longer.
I demand that...
You have signed an agreement.
If you have any objection, you will discuss them
With the immigration authorities as provided for in your papers.
But Mrs. March...
Later.
Stand up, my dear.
BEATRICE: I've got the same measurements as Marilyn Monroe.
Ahem, the lucky girl?
Yeah.
Allow me to be the first to offer
Congratulations to both of you.
For me?
Come on.
Come on.
Your room is in the basement, Anita.
Nina, your room is upstairs, right
Across from the top of the stairs.
I'll have to show you.
ANITA: I think it will be lonesome down there.
VICTOR: Nonsense, you will be all right.
Gracias.
Thank you.
[BEEPS AND WHIRRING]
Quien es?
Who is it?
[SCREAMS]
Bea, are you sure she's not in her room?
Yes.
Victor left a little while ago.
Maybe she went with him.
She didn't get out of this prison
Without permission, that's for sure.
But she would have said good-bye.
Why should she?
We only met her yesterday.
I don't blame her for not wanting
To sleep in the basement.
It's funny though.
Mrs. March wouldn't even listen when I asked to be dismissed.
This house gives me the creeps.
She doesn't even have any uniforms for us.
What in the world do you think you're doing?
You told us last night to clean and polish in here.
Look at your hands.
That will a stain o them.
No don't argue.
Go and wash them immediately.
You can put the things away after Nina cleans them.
Mrs. March, where is Anita?
Anita?
Oh, she left last night.
I would like to give notice too.
I will discuss it with you another time.
[BEEPS, WHIRRING AND BUBBLING]
Nina?
Nina?
Come here this instant.
Yes, Mrs. March.
Your name isn't Nina.
But Mrs. March she's got polish all over her hand
And I'm not doing anything.
I don't want you running up and down stairs.
Those pretty legs of yours will get ugly muscles.
Send Nina to me.
Yes, ma'am.
MRS. MARCH: I'll be in my room.
Bea, come with me.
I want to show you something.
Anita wouldn't leave without taking her clothes.
I think we better get out of here, fast.
Bea, I'd hate to leave if she's still here.
You'll go now if you go with me.
This hinge is loose.
Help me.
[BEEPING]
NARRATOR: One last experiment before Dr.
Frank would be ready.
But this was the most critical of all the experiments.
For the first time, the grafting operation
Would be performed on a living human body,
And the brain would come from the doctor's favorite cat.
Anita was ready.
[KNOCK AT DOOR]
It's me, Nina.
What about your clothes?
Never mind, let's go.
Bea, she almost saw us.
Let's wait awhile to make sure we won't run into her.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Bea.
Bea?
[THUNDER-LIKE SOUNDS] Bea?
Bea?
Where are you?
Answer me.
Wait.
I'm here Mrs. March.
She's locked us in.
Open it.
I said, open it.
Mrs. March.
Victor.
Victor.
Well, you took long enough.
The lawyer will see you in the morning.
I told him you we're going to change your will.
You'll have to check the basement door, it came loose.
You failed.
[MEOW] She thinks she's a cat.
Nice kitty.
[CAT GROWLING] Well, I see still resent the way
Mrs. March treats you.
I can't say that I blame you.
Kitty has always been very fond of me.
Haven't you?
Does she have all the instincts of a cat?
Watch.
[GROWLING]
She ate it.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Bea, is that Anita?
Where?
Oh, I don't think so.
Look out!
Somebody help her.
[GROWLING]
Back, Hans, back.
Hans, Hans.
I still think you should have locked them up.
They're not about to leave this house
After what they've witnessed.
They know Hans is outside there.
Even if we could get past that creature outside,
There's still the electric fence.
The phone's dead.
We can't get help that way.
If we could get the car...
That's it.
Victor.
Victor?
He likes me.
I guess.
If you could get the keys from him...
Bea, I was having a little night cap.
Who do you think you are pinching me?
Maybe you like some company?
Someone like me?
That's more like it.
Don't you like me, Victor?
Wait.
Hans, is chained.
Let's go outside.
Outside?
I think I'd like that.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
MRS. MARCH: Victor?
Victor?
[HISSING]
Anita?
What are you doing up there?
Anita, what's the matter with you?
Don't you know me?
Anita, listen to me...
[HISSING]
[GRUNTING AND GROWLING]
Anita?
Stay right there.
Don't move.
I'm coming.
[HISSING] Anita.
Anita, let me help you.
Anita, wait.
Take my hand.
Anita.
Anita!
[SCREAMS] Astonishingly complex, isn't it?
The human eye.
NINA: Dr. Crane?
Bea?
She's unconscious, but she'll live.
No.
She will live.
But Anita won't.
She's dead.
Nina, dear, come along with us now.
You've had a bad shock.
Get out of here, both of you.
I'm staying with Bea.
Why don't you do something for her?
I've done what I can for now.
Later, an operation might be possible.
I'm preserving the eye.
Let me show you.
Come over here.
The cellular structure is being kept alive
By these electrical vibrations.
I use the same principal in keeping that hand alive.
Bea is a very lucky girl.
You think that ironically?
Let me explain.
I'm the only man alive today capable
Of restoring your friend's sight.
Dr. Alexis Carrel, who pioneered the transplanting
Of vital human organs, kept a portion
Of an animal's heart alive for many years.
For this he received the Nobel Prize.
And I, who have so far surpassed his efforts...
Surely you don't want to compare
Yourself with Dr. Carrel.
He was humane.
I, too, fight to preserve life and to find the means
To improve the lives of future generations.
Your viewpoint is that narrow ignorant one,
Held by the Medical
Society today,
Which forces me to work in a place like this,
To give in to the whims of a foolish old woman,
Because she can supply me with the funds I
Need to continue my work.
[MOANING]
You're going to be all right.
Nina?
Yes, Bea.
I... I can't see.
Why...
Your eyes are bandaged.
Something happened.
Don't think about it now.
Listen to me, Bea.
Are you listening?
This is important.
Yes.
We must be ready when the chance comes.
I remember now.
It was Anita.
She... Oh, my eye.
My eye.
[SOBBING]
You better leave.
Give this a chance to take effect.
I'm a doctor.
I'll take care of her.
Make sure you'll take excellent care of her,
Until your plans call for something else.
Or am I to be the next one, doctor?
There.
Got all the clothes?
Yes.
And made my hair appointment?
I took care of everything on your list
While you were talking with the lawyer.
Hair appointment,
Monday, 10:00 AM, Charles
At the Ritz under Nina's name.
I'll want Nina to model these later after I've rested.
You tell her.
They're back.
I will have to leave you now.
Remember, I'm going to try to get us out here tonight.
No.
Forget about me.
I won't go.
Bea, don't talk like that.
NARRATOR: Mrs. March had not realized her new body had such
A satisfactory shape, perhaps not as spectacular
As the English girl, but in excellent taste.
She couldn't help being amused.
The stupid girl was not only modeling Mrs. March's
Future wardrobe but Mrs.
March's future body.
So firm, so nicely rounded in places men like.
You might have knocked when you came in.
I'm sorry, don't stop your style show on my account.
Does my aged look disturb you?
Hetty, that's unkind.
You see it's hard for a vain, stupid man
To realize that he holds no attraction
For a lovely young girl.
You're not needed now, Victor.
Close the door quietly when you go out.
I'm not going to be needed at all.
That's what you're saying, isn't it?
After tomorrow, when...
Victor!
That's enough Get out.
That's the way it's going to be when what?
Don't ask tiresome questions.
That will be enough for tonight.
I want us both to get some rest.
Try to sleep.
But Mrs. March...
That's an order.
Do as I say.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
You aren't looking for me, are you?
Why would a pretty, young girl want to be around an old man?
What did you try to tell Mrs. March?
So that's what you planned to do.
Get rid of old Victor once you get all that money.
The only thing is, of course, is won't really be you.
Victor, please tell me.
Try to make sense.
I am telling you.
Tomorrow, you'll be one of the richest women in the world.
Here's a press release.
It's in the mails now.
All the major news syndicates.
Orphan girl is sole heir to March millions.
Nina Rhodes has a lucky star.
I don't understand.
The next press release will be March
Mansion destroyed by fire.
Cinderella girl Nina
Rhodes, sole survivor.
Only it won't be you.
It's a pity too.
You're nice the way you are.
Please don't let it happen.
You could help me and Bea get away.
When you're a rich woman, you wouldn't forget an old friend,
A friend who saved your life, would you?
Get out in the car.
And stay there.
Victor, Bea too.
Bea must come too.
One minute.
Just to make sure.
Sign this.
Hurry.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[CYMBALS CRASHING]
Bea, you've got to come with...
No, I won't go.
Why should I want to go on living like this?
I'll get Victor to help me.
And we will carry you.
[SCREAMS]
Did you want something from Victor, dear?
Sit down, my dear.
I'm afraid you're wearing yourself out with all this
Rushing around I don't like that.
You realize she's mad, don't you, Dr. Frank?
Relax.
Hurry, doctor.
I'll be ready for you shortly, Mrs. March.
MRS. MARCH: I'll be waiting.
It's finally about to happen
You don't know what it's been
Like for me, living with this ugly body of mine.
Knowing that any attention I received
Was not for me but my money.
Well, nobody got any of it.
I've never known what it is like to be loved for myself alone.
Why did you kill
Victor, Mrs. March?
Victor?
Victor was a fool.
I'm a practical woman, Dr.
Frank, a business woman.
I've never been a very practical person.
I suppose that makes me a fool too in your eyes.
Of course not.
Relax, Mrs. March, just relax.
[ZAPPING SOUND]
Waking up are you?
Good, I want to talk to you.
You singed a paper making
Victor your legal guardian.
That's right, isn't it.
I did sign something, didn't I?
That would probably work as well for me.
We could stay here.
None of this would have to be destroyed.
Feeling better aren't you?
Try it on your own.
I want to know if Mrs.
March didn't intend blowing
Me up with all the rest of this.
You're a very wealthy woman now, Nina.
But I what I must decide is how to keep you
And your funds available with the least amount of nuisance
To myself.
I could keep you under sedation until your signature is
Required or I could replace your brain with one more amenable.
What about Mrs. March, doctor?
Mrs. March no longer has a thing to say.
Do you, my dear?
Completely recovered I'd say.
How do you feel.
[HISSING] I guess
A transplant would be better.
It won't hurt.
NARRATOR: Dr. Frank had enjoy this transplantation.
Mrs. March's brain ending up in the body of a cat.
Poetic justice to think of autocratic Mrs. March
Scavenging in back alley garbage cans for her dinner.
But Mrs. March doesn't take things lying down.
[ELECTRIC WHIRRING]
[MUSIC PLAYING] Mrs.
March did not intend to let their money get out of sight.
She would follow that girl.
Some time, some place, revenge would come.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
"In the 17th century,
Satan was abroad on the Earth..."
"...and great was the wrath against those monstrous beings,"
"...thirsty for human blood,"
"...to whom tradition has given the name of 'vampires'."
"No appeal for pity or mercy availed."
"Brothers did not hesitate to accuse brothers..."
"...and fathers accused sons..."
"...in the frantic attempt to purify the Earth of that horrible race..."
"...of blood-devouring assassins."
"But before putting them to death,"
"...human justice anticipated divine judgment..."
"...by burning into the flesh of those damned ones..."
"...the brand of Satan."
Asa, daughter of the House of Vajda,
...this High Court of the Inquisition of Moldavia...
...has declared you guilty.
I, the second-born son of Prince Vajda,
...as Grand Inquisitor, do condemn you.
And as your brother,
I repudiate you.
Too many evil deeds have you done to satisfy your monstrous love...
...for that serf of the Devil,
Igor Javutich.
May God have pity on your soul in this, your final hour.
Cover her face with the mask of Satan.
Nail it down!
May the cleansing flames reduce her foul body to ashes...
...so that the wind will obliterate all trace of her existence.
No... no!
No!
Griabby!
It is I who repudiate you,
...and in the name of Satan
I place a curse upon you.
Go ahead,
...tie me down to the stake,
...but you will never escape my hunger, nor that of Satan!
The unchained elements of the powers of darkness are lying in ambush.
Beware, Griabby!
My revenge will strike down you and your accursed house,
...and in the blood of your sons and the sons of their sons...
...I will continue to live, immortal!
They will restore to me the life that you now rob from me.
I shall return to torment and destroy throughout the night of time.
"As if by the Demon's command,"
"...the sudden fury of the elements extinguishes the purifying flames."
"The terrorised people run in flight from that cursed place."
"And for all that long night, the church bells toll..."
"...to keep away the spirits of evil."
"When the wrath is spent,"
"...the body of Javutich is covered with unconsecrated earth..."
"...in the burying place reserved for murderers."
"And the body of Asa, the witch, is placed in the tomb of her ancestors."
Coachman! Coachman!
How much further to the crossroads at Mirgorod?
Six or seven versts, my lord.
Did you hear that, sir?
If we stop at Mirgorod, we'll never reach Moscow by evening.
It doesn't matter. We can spend the night at the inn at Mirgorod.
Good smoked salmon and excellent vodka!
We'll still be in time for the congress tomorrow.
But we'll miss the opening address.
Too bad. Dr Blistanov of St Petersburg will be there, and Dr Steiner of Vienna.
How long have you had your degree?
Three years, Professor.
I've been with you for two.
When you've been in the profession as long as I have,
...you learn to take all the speeches at these conferences with a grain of salt.
Coachman! Stop!
Ho!
Take the forest road, it's shorter.
It's full of holes. No one uses it.
I understand.
You're afraid of the witch!
It's not so easy to frighten me,
...I fought through the war against Napoleon,
...but to tell you the truth,
...I'd rather find myself face to face with a cursed Frenchman than...
...than meet up with a ghost.
This will help you to forget all about ghosts. Here you are!
Come on, now, let's get going!
What's that wailing?
It's nothing, just the wind in the trees.
- What's happened?
- The branches of the tree, sir.
That branch reached out and tried to choke me.
Try not to choke yourself with that vodka.
Now, get a move on!
Why is he in such a hurry?
Well, between my tip and his fear...
Oh, what a mess!
Dear heaven!
Dear heaven, of all places for this to happen.
- Oh!
- Is it serious?
No, no. Fortunately it just slipped out of the socket.
I'll have it back in no time.
- Just a minute.
- Good.
It certainly isn't very cheerful here.
That weird sound.
It's coming from there.
Let's see what it is.
There! You see?
It's just the wind in the pipes of this broken-down organ.
What's happening, my lords?
It's nothing.
Continue with your work.
More than a thousand years of conflicts, hates and loves...
...all reduced to dust in these tombs.
Nothing remains of the ancient princes of Vajda...
...but the dead shadows of their former glory.
The history of ancient Moldavia is carved in these stones.
Andre, come here.
This is the witch of the old legend.
See this bronze mask?
One was always placed over the face of a condemned witch...
...so she would wear for all eternity her true face, the face of Satan.
Why is there a window?
They feared the witch might rise again...
...and maintained that a cross visible to her through the glass...
...would keep her nailed down forever.
- Incredible!
- My lords!
My lords, where are you?
Someone had better come and help me with this wheel.
Please don't leave me all alone in this infernal place!
He's frightened to death.
Go and help him.
I want to have another look around.
Frankly, I prefer it outside.
Not only is there no air in here, but it's also a little gloomy.
Professor?
Professor Kruvajan, what happened?
- Why did you fire?
- Look here.
That monster attacked me for some reason.
That's very strange.
Usually bats shy away from human beings.
Let's get out of here, Professor.
We'll be better off outside.
Otherwise the coachman will be convinced that he's right.
Wait.
What are you doing?
Still intact after two centuries.
Oh, you've cut yourself.
You're right,
I hadn't noticed it.
It must have been a splinter of glass.
Just a drop or two of blood, that's all.
Those empty eyes seem to be looking at us.
All right, we'll go.
Who are you?
What do you want?
I am Professor Choma Kruvajan and this is my assistant.
Andre Gorobec.
I was walking in the park when I heard a shot.
What happened?
I killed a large bat down in the crypt.
You must excuse us for taking the liberty of entering the chapel,
...but we thought it was an abandoned ruin.
We wanted to satisfy our curiosity.
It's all so strange, so mysterious here.
Everything is going to ruin.
My father, Prince Vajda, refuses to repair even this old chapel.
This place, in his eyes, is a curse.
My lords, the wheel is repaired.
We can go now.
All right, we're coming.
Please excuse us, Princess, but we must go.
We still have five versts to go to Mirgorod.
We are spending the night there.
If you don't mind,
I won't say goodbye to you.
Perhaps we will meet again.
Yes...
I trust you will spend a good night at... Mirgorod.
Well, spellbound?
What sadness in her eyes.
But look...
Ah, a souvenir of the witch.
Like a voice breaking off.
- What's that?
- Wolves!
That's why I couldn't find any tracks of wild deer today in the forest.
No, it seems to be something else out there.
Those are not wolves.
The griffin moved.
Constantine! Katia!
- What is it?
- Father!
- It wasn't painted like that.
- What?
It was alive before.
Now it's dead.
- What are you saying?
- I'm certain.
Father's right, it wasn't in that position before.
Katia, that portrait has always had a strange effect on you. I wonder why.
It's like a flame that can't escape.
There's something alive about it,
...something different about the eyes, the hands,
...as if it were hiding something.
Sometimes I'm afraid to go near it.
Katia!
Maybe Constantine is right.
I must have been dreaming.
We'll say no more about it.
How cold it is!
A chill seems to come out of the fireplace tonight that penetrates into my bones.
Why don't you get some sleep, Father?
Your eyes are tired.
No, my eyes aren't tired.
My spirit is.
You two go to bed now.
I want to be alone.
Good night.
Good night.
- Good night, my lord.
- No, wait, Ivan.
You've served in this house for many years.
I was born here, sir.
Today's the feast of St George.
You must know the legend of the curse that was placed on this castle.
Two centuries ago today, two people were executed for practising witchcraft.
Princess Asa and her accomplice,
Prince Javutich.
And to their faces was nailed the mask of Satan.
A hundred years later, again on St George's Day,
...an earthquake destroyed only the ancient chapel,
...and the witch's tomb was found split open,
...as if Asa had tried to break out to accomplish her revenge.
In fact, that same night
Princess Macha died mysteriously.
Macha was beautiful, the very image of Asa.
She was just 21 that day.
Like Katia.
And Katia is her living image.
It's as if the witch tormented her victims with her own beauty before killing them.
And it's this resemblance, this repeating of Asa's vengeance that terrorises me.
I'm afraid, Ivan.
You mustn't be afraid, my lord.
The cross will protect you.
Even if what you said is true,
...these monsters are terrified by the sacred symbol of Christ.
Always have it near you and you'll be safe.
Yes, you're right, Ivan.
It's the atmosphere surrounding this cursed day that has upset me so.
Drink your toddy, sir, before it gets cold.
It's death!
I've just seen death!
It's a warning, Ivan.
I won't be afraid.
They won't win. They cannot win against the symbol of Christ.
- Everything all right, sir?
- Yes, thank you.
You were right, Professor, this vodka is great.
Right now I feel as if I could conquer the world.
Starting with the castle.
If I'm not mistaken, someone there made quite an impression on you.
An excellent idea!
Another little drink or two...
...and that's exactly where I'd go.
You'd be wiser to go to sleep.
Mysterious princesses are more easily conquered in dreams.
Besides, we must be up early tomorrow.
You're right.
- Er... I'll tell them to call us at five.
- No, no, don't bother, I'll do it.
I'll take a little walk and then tell the innkeeper.
- All right. Good night.
- Good night.
And watch out for bats!
Watch out for your head!
No!
No, no.
- Why do you always carry on like this?
- I don't want to go.
Who do you think should go?
Me, with all I have to do?
Oh, excuse me, sir, but isn't it shameful that a big girl like her...
...is afraid to go to milk the cow in the barn?
Your mother is right.
She didn't say that the barn is beside the old haunted cemetery.
You mustn't be afraid of the dead.
They sleep soundly.
Hear what the gentleman said?
I'm coming!
Hurry. I'm busy.
Get a move on!
- I've been waiting for a half-hour.
- I'll go tonight, but tomorrow I won't.
Hello, Irina.
Rise, Javutich!
Javutich!
Rise!
Javutich!
Be still, Irina. Be still.
Are you frightened, too?
Oh, it's a storm.
Be good, Irina.
No!
Father!
- No! No!
- Father!
Look at me, Father.
It's Katia. Look at me!
- We must find a doctor.
- But where?
At the inn.
I met two doctors today in front of the chapel.
They said they were staying at Mirgorod.
Hurry, Ivan!
Go down and wake up the groom.
Here I am, Master.
I heard someone scream.
Go to the inn and get one of the doctors.
At once!
Yes, Master.
- Dr Kruvajan!
- Yes?
Princess Vajda has sent me.
Her father is very ill.
She begs you to come to the castle.
I'll come, but first
I must tell them at the inn.
You won't need to.
I've already done so.
They told me there where I could find you.
Ah. Very well, then.
Hey!
Kruvajan!
Kruvajan!
I've been waiting for you.
I need you again.
Look into my eyes.
Look into my eyes!
Come closer!
Just a few drops of your blood brought me to life again.
All of your blood will give me the strength to accomplish my vengeance.
Come! Kiss me!
My lips will transform you.
You will be dead to men, but you will be alive in death.
What's keeping Boris?
He's been gone so long.
He'll be back any moment now.
The griffin, the man in the painting...
- What's he saying?
- He's delirious.
No, no, only the crucifix can save us...
...on this day of the damned.
Did you send for me?
I'm so grateful to you for coming.
My father is delirious.
I'll take a look at him.
You may go now.
What's wrong with him, Doctor?
Nothing serious.
He's just had a slight shock.
We were asleep when all of a sudden we heard a frightening scream.
When we came in, he was trembling with his arm outstretched,
...holding this cross to keep back some horrible apparition.
Take it away!
He mustn't see it.
It might provoke another attack.
Our eternal sleep has been broken.
You were able to do it.
You tore me out of the earth that weighed heavily on me.
This time you are not alone.
I will bring you her body.
She will be your victim.
She was born for this fate.
She is your living image.
Destiny has its way, Asa.
In her you will live again,
...speak again...
...and smile as she does.
We'll live once more, as we used to.
Get some rest, Constantine.
Father is sleeping quietly.
- No, I'm not tired.
- Go, both of you. I will stay here.
Oh, dear, those dogs keep howling so!
Ivan, try to quiet them.
Yes, my lady.
You go. I'll stay here.
- But if...
- I'll call you if necessary.
All right, then.
What's the matter?
Shh... quiet now!
What is it?
I thought you'd fallen asleep.
Why don't you go to bed now?
I'll stay and watch over your father.
But aren't you leaving Mirgorod at dawn?
It doesn't matter.
I can stay the night here.
He seems to be much calmer now, doesn't he?
Yes. You'll see he'll have a restful night's sleep.
You needn't worry any more.
Go and get some rest yourself.
You must need it.
Doctor, I don't know how to thank you.
Please call me if there should be any change.
I am sure there will be no need.
Your room is across the corridor here.
- Good night, and thank you again.
- Good night.
Katia!
Katia!
Katia!
- Poor father!
- No!
Dr Kruvajan!
Dr Kruvajan!
No, Katia! Don't go!
Katia, don't...
Don't look, Katia!
Professor Kruvajan!
Professor Kruvajan!
It's Andre.
Your friend has already left the inn.
- Left?
- Last night. He was called to the castle.
It seems that Prince Vajda was suddenly taken seriously ill.
He hasn't come back yet.
- I wonder why he didn't take me.
- Maybe he didn't want to disturb you.
My daughter saw him get in the coach that came from the castle to pick him up.
- Could I have a horse?
- Right away. Come with me.
Be careful!
If you upset the basket, I'll fix you!
Say! Excuse me.
Is this the shortest road to the Vajda castle?
- Yes, sir, take the one going uphill.
- Thank you.
The current's stronger down here.
Oh, please!
I told you not to play around here!
- The shirt's fallen in the water!
- There it is!
A shirt!
Oh, how am I going to catch it?
Watch out or you'll fall in the water, too!
There it is!
It's getting closer. There it is!
Who is it?
Dr Kruvajan!
Who are you?
What do you want?
I am Dr Gorobec.
I heard that Dr Kruvajan was called to the castle last night.
Yes, that is correct.
We called him to attend my father, who had a sudden attack of shock.
We left the doctor alone with him, but he went away.
If he hadn't left my father alone like this, he might still be alive.
I must say, I don't understand your colleague's strange behaviour in this case.
You're right.
I don't know how to explain it,
...but I assure you
I am much more surprised than you are.
I know Professor Kruvajan very well.
I don't understand.
Something serious must have happened,
I am sure of it.
It's very strange. When I left the inn, he still hadn't returned.
He's not there?
Please, come up.
Merciful heaven, it's Boris, the groom from the castle.
I want to see!
Let me by!
That's who it is. Poor Boris!
He looks terrible.
How did he end up here?
The river.
Can't you see he's dead?
- Ah...
- Katia!
- We must take her away.
- Yes.
- Where is her room?
- This way.
Quickly, some water.
The features of his face are changed.
They are not human.
It's like the face of Satan.
It made me sick to see it.
It's as if the Demon had devoured him from the inside.
Shh. Don't talk so loud.
Maybe it's better not to tell them.
They're stricken by their father's death.
Ivan! What's this all about?
They've found Boris's body, my lord, down by the stream.
Boris's body?
Yes, Your Excellency.
You should see how he looks.
His eyes are popping out of their sockets, his teeth are bared,
...and his hands are clenched.
Where is he now?
We carried him into the sacristy.
The parish priest is with him.
- You there!
- Me?
Yes. Come here.
Your mother says you saw the carriage that came to fetch Dr Kruvajan.
Yes, my lord.
I saw it as I was coming back from the barn.
I heard a noise, so I hid in the bushes.
But it wasn't Boris who was driving the coach.
I know Boris's face very well.
It was a stranger.
At least, I've never seen him before.
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes, my lord.
I'm going to the village to see Boris's body.
And you come with me, but remember, you must tell me everything you know.
Do you understand that?
It's very important.
Certainly, sir.
I'll tell you everything.
Go on. So long, now.
Go on to your houses.
Go on.
That's the man!
Yes! That's who it is!
The man who came last night to get Dr Kruvajan.
I swear it, my lord.
That's the man. I'm certain.
I could see him clearly.
The moon was shining on his face.
Whose face?
Enough of this child's fantasies...
...about a portrait of someone who's been lying dead for centuries,
...or else we'll all go mad.
Calm yourself, Princess.
I must leave you now, but I'll be back.
And try to be courageous.
We'd be glad to have you stay here with us tonight, Doctor.
Yes.
Please do, we'll feel so much safer.
It's incredible.
He died in the same horrible way as the Prince.
The wounds on his neck look like the work of a wild beast,
...but one who punctures the flesh without tearing it.
As a doctor I have complete faith in science, but...
And this strange behaviour of Professor Kruvajan.
It doesn't seem possible that a man such as he could abandon a patient...
...and disappear without saying anything.
On my way here I passed by the inn, but no one had seen him,
...and the innkeeper's daughter insisted today...
...that the man in the portrait at the castle is the same as the driver...
...who came last night to fetch Professor Kruvajan.
It makes my head spin.
I don't understand.
The man in the portrait, did you say?
Yes, the portrait hanging near the fireplace.
An old 17th-century painting.
A painting of a man in black with a silver griffin embroidered on his chest?
Yes. Why?
Nothing. Nothing.
Oh, Father.
Prince Constantine would like you to prepare the funeral for tomorrow.
Yes, very well. Everything will be ready for tomorrow.
Go!
Help!
Help me!
What is it? Katia?
- What is it, Princess?
- There's someone hiding in my room.
- Where?
- Behind the curtain.
Come!
Ivan, stand guard in the salon.
Over there, behind the curtain.
There's nobody there.
You must have imagined it.
No! I saw it through the mirror.
I saw a hand.
You don't believe me, but I tell you,
Constantine, I saw it, I saw it...
- I'll get her a sedative.
- Katia, don't cry.
Professor Kruvajan, it's you!
You frightened me.
Where have you been?
What happened?
I've been searching for you all day.
Your hair!
Go away, Andre.
Far away from here.
Don't get involved in things that don't concern you.
Since you didn't come to the inn,
I brought your luggage here for you.
Look, I was just trying to decipher this inscription.
Professor!
Krug! Brug!
- They're bleeding to death.
- Yes, and I think I know who...
Come now. Quickly!
Carry everything into the salon where the coffin will be set up.
Take this.
Easy, there.
And he fled from you in terror?
Yes, the moment
I showed him the icon...
...he disappeared without any explanation.
It's very difficult to find the right translation...
...for these old Cyrillic inscriptions.
The important thing is to get the key word.
If I take it with me, I'll compare it with some texts I have in the library.
- I'd be so grateful to you.
- Father.
As you know, my sister's been suffering terribly from these shocking events.
I'd appreciate it if you could urge her to leave the castle.
I tried to convince her, but it was useless.
She said it would be disrespectful.
Princess Katia.
I hope I'm not intruding.
No, I just feel so desperate and alone.
I understand, but you mustn't despair.
You must always have faith in yourself, in life.
In life?
What is my life?
Sadness and grief.
Something that destroys itself day by day, and no one can rebuild it.
Here is the very image of my life.
Look at it.
It's being consumed hour by hour like this garden.
Abandoned to a purposeless existence.
If the hand of man abandons this castle,
...or even this Earth,
...there is no reason why you should do likewise with your life and your youth.
Go far away from here and you will be happy again, Katia.
Forgive me if I call you by name.
And remember that I'll always be ready to help you.
You're very kind, Andre,
...but today everything seems so hopeless.
I feel a sense of terror, a presentiment of death,
...of being destroyed by something that's inside me.
How I wish I had your faith, your strength.
You mustn't give in to despair.
I know it's hard for you,
...but even here in this garden the sun will reach into the darkest corners...
...and chase away the shadows of the night.
Andre, help me.
I beg you to help me.
Thank you.
Without you I wouldn't have had the courage to go on.
In moments like this it's difficult to... find the right words, but...
...when this is all over, Katia...
Thank you, Andre.
Thank you.
It was the only way I could think of to put out the fire, my lord.
Strange.
I wonder what can be hidden behind here.
Doctor!
When Ivan was putting out a fire that had started in a hanging...
...he ripped through this canvas.
- Look.
- Be careful.
It's pitch-black inside here.
A secret passageway.
Then my father was not delirious.
And his last words were "the silver griffin" and "the man in the portrait".
This is where I found the dogs with their throats slashed,
...where Kruvajan disappeared.
Let's go in.
You stay here, Ivan.
Make sure the door doesn't close.
Don't move.
No, my lord.
It's the same girl as the portrait in the salon.
The witch in the crypt.
How did you know about her?
I saw her when Dr Kruvajan and I visited the abandoned chapel.
Wait a minute.
Two days ago, this tomb was intact, and the witch...
She looks as if she had just died.
Look!
She's breathing.
We're in the presence of some unnatural mystery.
I must talk to the priest.
You return to the castle.
Don't leave Katia alone for a moment.
Go out that way, you'll get to the stables quicker.
Ivan!
Ivan!
From what you tell me, there can be no more doubt.
We are faced by the unleashed powers of the Demon.
The ancient words on the icon explain exactly what must be done.
We must find the grave of Javutich... before sunset.
Father!
- Yes?
- Look, the mask of Satan.
Like the one I saw over the witch's face.
It's just as I had feared.
We'll find him buried here.
Look! A freshly dug grave.
Open the coffin.
It's Dr Kruvajan.
But... last night... he was still alive.
I saw him.
No, he was already dead.
But it's impossible, Father.
He moved, even spoke to me.
Then he ran away.
Sometimes Satan, with his capacity of doing evil,
...even plays tricks with the dead.
You see?
This is the proof.
Now we must find a way for his poor soul to rest in peace.
Yes, but how?
The inscription on the icon indicates the only way.
The spell is broken.
Poor Kruvajan.
We must take action.
And quickly, for now it is all clear.
The witch had transformed your friend into the slave of the Devil.
Dead during the day, but alive by night,
...so he could carry out
Satan's nefarious orders.
- Then the Prince, too?
- Yes.
But now we will have to make haste,
...for the witch may regain her life completely.
How could she?
By possessing and entering the body of a young woman.
- Katia!
- Yes, Katia.
Hurry back to the castle.
It's late.
Before the sun goes down, go to the crypt and pierce the left eye of the witch.
Go now.
I will do the same to the body of Boris, which is still in the sacristy.
And then I'll join you.
Constantine?
Ivan?
Ivan?
Constantine?
Where is everyone?
Where have you gone?
Help!
Help!
Help!
Where are you?
Help!
Constantine!
Andre!
Help me, Father!
Please help me.
Don't leave me alone with all these horrors.
Father!
Father? Father!
I am no longer your father.
My blood is no longer your blood.
The spirits of evil have rent that tie between us forever,
...and an accursed poison flows in your veins.
No!
Constantine!
Ivan!
Open up!
At last your vengeance is at hand, Asa.
Now you will be free forever.
Katia!
Constantine!
Where are you?
Katia! Constantine!
Katia!
You did not know that you were born for this moment.
You didn't know that your life had been consecrated to me by Satan,
...but you sensed it, didn't you?
You sensed it, didn't you?
That's why my portrait was a constant temptation to you,
...why it frightened you.
You felt your life and your body were mine.
You felt like me because you were destined to become me,
...a useless body without life.
The love that young man had for you could have saved you.
You might have been happy together, but I was stronger...
...and now you shall enjoy a beautiful life of evil and hate in me.
No!
Constantine!
Don't worry about me.
Save Katia.
Don't lose time.
Save Katia... from the witch.
Katia!
Katia, thank heaven... that I've arrived in time.
Yes, she wanted to kill me.
Quick, Andre, do something before it's too late.
I couldn't do it. Quickly.
Yes, yes, you're right.
We must destroy her forever,
...and I know how it can be done.
Don't look, Katia.
It's horrible, but I must do it.
But this is your cross.
Katia! How is it possible?
I understand.
Come.
No!
No, I am not your love.
There she lies, dead.
Forever. Forever.
My vengeance is complete.
All of her family is destroyed. All!
Look, Andre.
Look into my eyes.
Yes, look at me the way Kruvajan did that night...
...and, like him, lose yourself deep in my eyes.
Don't you feel the joy and the beauty of hating?
Look!
She... She is the witch.
Don't be deceived by her face.
Look at her body.
She is transforming herself into Katia...
...by draining her life's blood.
Take her!
Two centuries ago,
...a storm prevented the flames from destroying her wicked soul,
...but today her innocent victims have broken the spell of Satan.
Why?
Why was Katia taken away from me, Father?
And she is dying with Katia's beauty.
Katia...
My life is finished too now.
How can I ever forget her?
How can I resign myself?
I will never find peace.
Look, her young body... destroyed.
Father!
Katia.
Katia.

THE BLACK HAlR
In old Kyoto there was a young samurai who had been reduced to poverty by the ruin of his lord.
He decided to leave his home and take service with the governor of a distant province.
Goodbye.
Stay well. I can't live here with you. I have a future.
For men, advancement is the most important.
I can't give it up just because of you.
I can't bury my future here.
Must you leave Kyoto?
I'll work harder than before.
I'll weave day and night.
I'll slave for a better living.
If I lose this chance,
I'll be finished.
Don't try to stop me. The new post will bring me fortune.
If you can remarry a man of some distinction, you'll have fortune too.
There's nothing more to say.
I've had enough of poverty!
You're going to leave early in the morning.
So you better go to bed now.
Take her to the bridal chamber.
My daughter is finally married.
I feel relieved now.
I'm glad to have you in my family.
Thank you.
He knows his obligation.
He'll serve her well.
Please, take care of my daughter.
Yes.
The samurai could not understand the value of love.
He divorced his good wife and married the daughter of a noted family to gain position.
And he took her to his new post.
It was the thoughtlessness of youth and the experience of desire.
His second marriage did not prove a happy one.
His new wife was selfish and callous.
He soon found every cause to recall with regret his Kyoto days.
Then he discovered he still loved his first wife -
Ioved her more than he could ever love his second.
And he began to realise how unfair and how ungrateful he had been.
Memories of a woman he had wronged - her gentle speech. her smile. her pretty dainty ways. her impeccable patience...
... continuously haunted him.
I quit!
The same old game!
I'm tired of it!
Girls, you're dismissed.
You better go to bed now.
Your husband is still reading.
How ungrateful you are!
You've gained position because of my family's social prestige.
You only used me.
You're always cherishing your old memories.
You're walking out on me!
The dew won't help.
Please, go to your bedroom and nurse her ladyship.
Nurse her? That's your duty.
Don't say that.
She may return to her parents tomorrow if she wants to.
I can't stand seeing her dissatisfied look any more.
Tell her so.
After all, I was young and thoughtless.
I'll find my ex-wife whom I deserted and make amends for my sinful act.
The years went by.
And his official term expired.
It was September 10th when he reached the street of Kyoto where his first wife used to live.
It was midnight and the city was as silent as a cemetery.
When did you come back to Kyoto?
Now. Just now.
How did you find your way to me, through all those black rooms?
Stay seated.
Don't bother.
I'll get supper.
I don't want it.
You haven't changed a bit.
You look just like you did before.
Your face that I couldn't forget for a moment... and your voice that was so dear to me!
Forgive me.
I was cruel. I was a fool.
I deserve your hatred.
Until the day my official term expired, how I longed to come back to you!
How deeply I regretted my selfishness!
How wretched I was without you!
How I loathed myself for divorcing you!
How long I've hoped and planned to make amends!
As soon as I became free.
I wanted to come back to Kyoto and find you.
I hurried here in the dark.
It's very kind of you thinking about me so much.
Forgive me.
Please forgive me.
I was such a fool!
Don't reproach yourself.
It's wrong to allow yourself to suffer on my account.
I always felt that I wasn't worthy of being your wife.
Don't...
I knew that, but I couldn't help trying to be near you.
Anyway, it was very cruel of me to have divorced you.
It was because of poverty.
While you lived with me, you were always kind.
Why should I think ill of you?
I prayed for your good fortune every day and night.
I'll make amends.
Forget it.
You came a long way home.
What greater happiness than to see you again... even if only for a moment?
Only for a moment!
Make it the length of seven lifetimes!
Unless you forbid it,
I'll live with you always... always!
Nothing shall ever separate us again.
Your fragrant hair!
It's the same as before.
The same glossy hair... dark eyes...
Iovely nose... soft cheeks... and...
I've forgotten my sorrow.
Many things have happened in Kyoto since you went away.
I imagine so.
I can't tell you everything in a night.
Soon it'll be dawn.
Yes. This room is very dear to me.
It was our bridal chamber.
We spent several nights here.
I don't want to sleep now.
I want to talk of the past and the present and the future with you and feel as happy as I am now.
I also feel as if this were a dream.
I don't want to sleep for a moment so I can keep you forever.
THE WOMAN OF THE SNOW
In a village of Musashi Province there lived two woodcutters:
Mosaku and Minokichi.
Mosaku was an old man and Minokichi. his apprentice. was a boy of eighteen.
Everyday. they went to a forest a few miles away from the village.
One cold day. a great snowstorm overtook them on their way home.
The boatman had left his boat on the other side of the river.
It was no day for swimming.
I intended to treat you like the other man.
But I couldn't help feeling pity for you because you're so young.
You're a handsome boy.
I will not hurt you now.
But if you ever tell anybody - even your own mother about what you've seen tonight,
I'll know it.
And then I'll kill you.
Remember that.
Understand?
I'll be going now.
We sell wood for a living.
You can't work for some time, not before spring.
The terrible cold night made you ill.
Eat the porridge.
Take care of yourself, son.
Or you'll be frozen and dead like that old Mosaku whose blood was all gone.
If this happens to you again, you won't survive.
Are you listening?
You've said nothing about that night.
A year passed.
As soon as he got well. he resumed working.
Every morning. he went to the forest alone and returned with bundles of wood after sunset.
Where are you going in the evening?
Edo.
Now?
Yes.
I lost my parents.
My relatives in Edo might help me find work as a servant.
Brothers?
None?
You'd need connections to find work in Edo.
Is it so hard to get work when you don't know anyone?
You could get married...
With you?
Come!
That's my house.
Why don't you take a rest?
There's nobody you have to mind.
But...
Only my mother and I live there.
Come!
Your name is Yuki?
I see, I see.
Going to Edo alone sounds very dangerous.
People are not always kind.
Young girls must be careful not to be bothered by bad men.
Come eat while it's hot.
And Yuki bore him three children. handsome and very fair of skin.
She acquired a fame for being a good wife among the villagers.
T ake a moment to reflect on Grandma's grave.
Show her you've grown up.
Give her your flowers.
It seems she never gets old.
Really.
She's as young today as on the day she first came into the village.
She's a wonder.
Were you at the grave?
Yes. It's my mother-in-law's memorial day.
That's good.
She must be pleased to see her nice grandchildren praying for her.
She's happy.
She died praising her son's wife.
It's not very common.
No.
Usually, a mother-in-law talks ill of her son's wife.
No matter how good the wife is.
That's not true.
Thanks to you, I'm happy.
What a happy couple, you and your husband!
He must be happy.
He has such a good and beautiful woman for a wife.
Naturally.
What a young wife!
Most peasant women age early after having three children.
She still looks like a girl.
She's a wonder.
Put them on.
Is it too small?
And the children's?
I made them.
How nice! All ready... the sandals for the holiday season!
If the thongs are too tight,
I'll fix them.
Now try them on.
Yes.
How beautiful!
Why the red thongs?
You're still young.
I'm a mother of three children.
Red is still your colour.
Your feet look beautiful.
It fits well.
Not too tight, not too lose.
It's exactly my size.
Your sandals look beautiful and sturdy so people come to you for special orders.
This pair is exceedingly good.
I made them so that they'll match your kimono.
As if I were going away on a journey!
I can't buy you a new kimono, so at least you have sandals.
With your sandals and my kimono our children will have a wonderful holiday.
How is it going?
A few more stitches.
Why are you watching me so intently?
I just remembered that night ten years ago.
It's strange to recall it now after so many years.
You're sewing with the light on your face and I'm looking up at you like this.
That's why I remembered that night...
What night?
A strange thing happened that night.
I can remember it well as if it happened yesterday.
I was eighteen then. I never told anybody about that night.
I'm not sure it was real or a dream.
It was the night that old Mosaku was frozen dead as if his blood were all gone.
I saw with my own eyes a woman who was bending over him.
And she was blowing her breath like a white smoke upon him.
Then he became stiff and couldn't move.
That woman stooped over me, too.
And I got almost numb.
Then, the eyes of the horrible woman
Iooked very, very beautiful.
She was so beautiful and white like you.
Yes!
You looked exactly like her just now.
That's why I remembered.
Once the memory haunted me day and night.
I became sick after that.
I tell you, it was when I spent the terrible snowstormy night in the ferryman's hut.
I saw very clearly the weird woman who killed old Mosaku.
I've never seen in my life a woman as beautiful and white as her except you.
Of course, she's not a human being and I was afraid of her.
She was the Woman of the Snow who was hungry for warm blood...
...or a dream.
...or a dream.
Not a dream.
I...
It was me.
Me!
Me!
It was Yuki.
You promised that night you'd never tell anybody.
You finally broke the promise.
It was a pledge for life for both of us.
I told you if you broke it,
I would kill you.
You betrayed me!
Ah, if it were not for those children asleep there
I would kill you this moment!
From now on you'd better take good care of those children.
If they have any reason to complain about you
I'll treat you as you deserve!
HOlCHl, THE EARLESS
The time had come.
It was dawn on March 24th in Year 1 of the Genryaku era (1 1 85)
The armies of the Genji and Heiké clans were determined to fight one last time at Dan-no-ura, off Kyushu in the Shimonoséki Strait.
Procurator Kanzo from Kumano had hoisted the Kongo-Doji flag and placed on the frontline the boats belonging to Kawanano Michinobu, inhabitant of the Province of Lyo.
He'd decided to side with the Genji with his warriors, on board two hundred ships.
Good morning.
Would you get me Maj. Bernard at his Whitehall number?
Thank you.
Hello. Thank you.
Alan? It's Gordon.
Look, you're coming down here today, aren't you?
Could you pick up a book for me and bring it with you? It's...
Gordon?
Operator.
Blast.
It got cut off. That was my brother-in-law.
Would you try again? I have got to change.
Yes, sir.
Operator, we've been cut off from Midwich 25.
Would you get it again, please?
Hello, will you replace
your receiver, please?
Please replace your receiver.
- For more than an hour, you're saying.
- Yes, sir.
Perhaps something went wrong with his phone.
This is what puzzles me.
I have also tried the vicar, the general stores, and the post office.
I can't get any reply from any of them.
Country telephone exchanges being what they are.
Yes, I know, sir, but look here.
Midwich is here.
Now 4th Brigade are running that exercise of theirs all round there.
I don't think there's anything in it, but I was wondering... as I was going down for the weekend... whether I could have your permission to leave a little earlier.
All right, Alan.
- Give me a ring later. I'll be here till 5:00.
- Thank you, sir.
- Alan.
- Yes, sir?
Have a nice weekend.
Give my respects to Gordon.
I will. Goodbye, sir.
- Hello, Gobby.
- It's Maj. Bernard.
What's happened to the telephones?
I've been trying to get through.
It's funny you should ask, Major.
I've been sent to look for the bus which hasn't turned up.
We can't get through by phone either.
Here's your bus, Gobby.
Struth.
Better have a look.
All right, Alan, get hold of the local Area Commander.
- What's his name?
- Ward Johnson, sir.
Tell him to call me if he wants authorization.
I'll get things moving this end.
Make sure the newspapers don't get hold of this for the time being.
If anything has got out of hand there, we don't want any panic.
Report back as soon as you have any results.
Right, sir.
Get me South Eastern Command, please.
Over here, Sergeant.
Look, the canary.
- You needn't go in if you don't want to.
- I'll have a go, sir.
- Quite sure?
- Sir.
- What on earth's happening...
- Just a minute.
Hello, Doctor, I'm glad you're here.
We may need you.
- What's wrong with him?
- That's what we're trying to find out.
- Will you take a look at him, Doc?
- Take off the respirator.
Pulse is normal.
Seems to be breathing normally.
I think he's just fainted.
He's coming round.
You better let me know what this is all about.
- When were you last in the village?
- Midwich?
I left at about 10:00.
Had a couple of patients to see in Widmarsh.
Now there are road blocks all over the place.
I've got to get back.
I've got patients to see.
My hunch is that all your patients in Midwich... are in the same state as this man.
All right, old chap. Take it easy.
What can it be?
To put a man out like a light, penetrate our respirators, do all this.
- Some sort of gas?
- No, it can't be.
Any breeze would have blown it about a bit.
The edges of the area are as well-defined as that hedge there.
Cold.
- What did you say?
- Ice-cold.
I'm all right, sir, only cold.
My hands are like ice.
Midwich to Charlie Alpha.
Can you see anything? Over.
Everything looks all right from here. Over.
Let me speak to him.
Hello, Charlie Alpha.
This is Maj. Bernard speaking.
Can you see nothing unusual at all in Midwich? Nothing moving?
No, sir, nothing.
Matter of fact, that's odd.
Nothing is moving down there.
I can see some people, but they're not moving either.
They're lying on the ground.
- As though they've fallen?
- Yes, sir.
Right.
Take it down slowly, but pull up the minute you feel anything.
Feel anything, sir?
- Anything unusual.
- Roger.
Still nothing moving, sir. Taking her down.
Careful now.
Easy.
Another aircraft approaching.
Send out a general warning now.
All aircraft to avoid this area and not to drop below 5,000 feet.
Yes, sir.
Midwich to base. Emergency.
I say again, emergency.
Warn all aircraft to avoid area,
5-mile radius.
Latitude 51 degrees, 10 minutes,
30 seconds north.
Longitude 1 degree, 11 minutes,
20 seconds west.
Maintain minimum altitude of 5,000 feet. Out.
Blimey! Look!
Darling, I'm sorry. I must have dozed off.
Look at the time. It's almost 3:00.
Why didn't you call me?
I'd better go and see about lunch.
Anthea.
I found myself asleep on the floor.
What an extraordinary thing to do.
I'm cold.
The fire's gone out.
Did you...
Did we faint?
Must have blacked out.
Why?
My hands are quite numb.
What did happen?
I don't know.
You're all right.
- You're late.
- I couldn't get through.
Get through?
What did you mean you're all right?
How did you know?
It's extraordinary, but we blacked out for several hours.
- I know.
- It must have been a gas leak.
It was not only you two.
The whole village fell asleep.
All of Midwich was cut off from the outside world for several hours.
- Anything registering?
- No, sir, nothing unusual.
Keep at it.
- Mr. Zellaby.
- Yes, Miss Ogle?
Are these people from the telephone company?
- Not the telephone company.
- That's what I said.
If they want to pull the wool over our eyes... they ought to try something better.
- I'm trying to find out...
- After all, we're not stupid, are we?
What's happened isn't natural.
Tell you what we'll do.
I'll press for an official explanation... while you help to stop the rumors getting about. All right?
Do you mind?
- Soil samples?
- Yes, sir.
- Plant life?
- Even the bark on the trees.
Don't forget insects, grasses, water, metals.
The sooner and more elaborate these tests can be made, the better.
It's okay. This is Professor Gordon Zellaby.
Yes, sir.
No one seems to have come to any harm.
A few cuts and bruises where they fell.
Lucky no one was in their bath.
They might have been drowned.
Hello, Mrs. Harrington.
The least they can do is offer us some kind of compensation.
- But you feel all right?
- No thanks to them if I do.
And a large burn in my best dress into the bargain.
What the wife means is... you don't hardly expect to drop asleep before dinner, do you?
We've established that whatever it was, was static, odorless, invisible.
It didn't register on radar.
It was non-metallic.
It showed nothing on our Geiger counters.
You have got the reports there.
There are no signs of physical, biological, or psychological changes.
That's practically meaningless.
For instance, serious exposure to x-rays or gamma rays... need not have an immediate effect.
But these people have to be kept under observation.
- And yourself.
- And my household.
It would be a bit tricky to put you all in a sanatorium.
My instructions are to keep the whole incident out of the limelight.
- National security?
- Lf you like.
Until we know the cause, we shan't know what to expect.
Since you are there, suppose you keep an eye on Midwich for us?
If you find anything, let us know through Alan.
There's no need for direct contact between us.
More security? Ever cautious.
It gets under the skin, you know.
- Anything else today, Mrs. Zellaby?
- No, that's all, thank you.
I'll have to get in a new supply of pickles if you go on like this.
I do seem to be getting through a lot these days, don't I?
That'll be £17.6.
- Shall I add it to the account?
- Yes, thank you.
How's the Professor?
He's very well. Very well indeed.
Good morning.
- Miss Ogle, dear.
- Yes?
I think there's going to be news up at Kyle Manor.
News? What kind of news?
Hello.
I said, hello.
- How long have you been here?
- Ages.
Liar.
I have just discovered a fascinating thing.
Here are the plant samples from that day.
This one for example.
Perfectly ordinary pelargonium zonale.
What's happening is exactly what you'd expect if I made a 50% graft...
Why did you kiss me like that?
Come on, what's the secret?
Something's afoot. Why are you so happy?
Now, Gordon, I want you to sit down.
Keep quite calm.
There's nothing to worry about.
Now.
We have apparently succeeded... in crossing a Zellaby Gordonius with a Zellaby Antheum.
Just what the results will be, we shan't know for some time yet.
I think you should sit down.
- Can I get you some tea?
- No.
A drink? No, that wouldn't be right.
Feet up?
- Something to eat?
- Yes, please.
What?
Cheese, pickles, and half a dozen anchovies.
Recently my favorite diet.
Hadn't you noticed?
Mrs. Plumpton at the shop has.
I have been too engrossed in my work, but we'll change all that.
Thank you, darling.
You've made my happiness complete.
But all the more so because I am old enough to appreciate it.
Now then, what was it you wanted?
Cheese, pickles... and half a dozen anchovies.
I'm afraid there's no doubt about it.
Milly...
I wish there was something I could say to comfort you...
'cause I know what you'll have to put up with... from some of the people in the village over this.
But you can count on me to do anything
I can to help you and your child.
Do you think I'd...
Do you think I could...
Milly, I told you, there's no doubt about it.
Now if there's anyone you want me to talk to about this.
But I've never...
It's impossible.
This is some present, Jim. Thanks a lot.
Where did you say you got it? Tokyo?
It's a real beauty.
You can take action pictures in this light.
Jan, look at me.
When I learn to use this properly,
I might go into the photo business.
Jan, turn this way. That's right.
I want to see how...
What's the matter with you?
Jim comes back after a whole year... and you look as if you were going to a funeral.
An attempted suicide.
Janet Pawle, whose husband only came back from sea yesterday.
- It's dreadful.
- Three other women in the village... half out of their minds.
Milly Hughes, Rose Shepherd,
Mary Burnett.
- Please don't go on.
- That's why we're asking you to tell us.
Please don't keep on.
Don't you see what you're asking me is not right ethically?
For heaven's sake, Vicar.
How do you think I feel?
I married late in life.
When my wife told me that she was going to have a baby... it was the happiest moment
I've ever known.
Don't talk to me about ethics.
Don't you see that this is something which concerns all of us... that this is the one moment when it is your duty to break confidence.
Very well.
Four of them have been to see me.
One of them is only 17.
- Evelyn Harrington?
- Yes.
She was terribly frightened, and frankly, so am I.
I know these girls.
I watched them grow up.
When they tell me they've no way of accounting for their condition...
I am compelled to believe them.
That means every woman in this village... who is capable of childbirth is going to have a baby.
I can't believe it.
This is not a matter of belief, Vicar.
It's a matter of fact.
And there's something else.
All this seems to date from that day two months ago... when Midwich was cut off from the rest of the world.
Who's next?
This is Anthea Zellaby's, Doctor.
Let's have a look at it.
It's one of the most perfectly formed embryos I've ever seen.
Yes, but is it normal?
It's more than normal.
It's a 7-month embryo after only 5 months.
It's all right. I've seen the x-rays, and it's a fine specimen.
Dr. Willers says it's perfect, absolutely normal.
That should make us very happy.
It's going to be all right.
Is it? Is that what you believe?
You're tired, darling.
That's right. I'm tired.
And do you know why?
Because every night I lie awake and worry.
Now you don't have to worry anymore.
You don't really believe that.
- Dr. Willers says...
- I don't care what Dr. Willers says.
All right, so it's not a monster.
It's a perfect specimen.
- But what does that tell me?
- You're going to have a baby.
Whose baby? Yours?
Does it tell me what kind of life is growing inside me?
What sort of brain it has?
Where it comes from?
Does it tell me that?
Where does it come from?
Stop it!
You must stop it.
We've got to be rational about this.
We may not be any better off than any of the others... but there is absolutely nothing we can do but wait.
Maybe it's ours, maybe it isn't.
If it's ours, we shall know it. If it isn't...
I'm afraid.
I'm so afraid.
I hope that none of them lives.
What a ridiculous way to behave.
We're still terribly busy, but Doctor said to tell you... that Mrs. Zellaby's fine.
- And the baby?
- Perfect.
- In every respect?
- Hello, Gordon.
- Got a cigarette?
- How about the baby?
Splendid. Unusually heavy, though.
10 pounds, 8 ounces.
Strange eyes.
All right. You can go in now.
- Got a cigarette?
- Yes, of course.
How many others have been delivered so far tonight?
Anthea's my third.
What about their weight?
All slightly over 10 pounds.
All have got these strange eyes.
All that worrying. And now...
Gordon, have you seen him?
He's such a beautiful baby.
I do love you so.
He's probably jealous.
Now be quiet, Bruno.
Lie down and behave yourself.
Handsome, isn't he?
Take a look at this, Doctor.
It's a section of hair.
Yes, it's flat on one side, on the other an arc.
Somewhat in the shape of a narrow capital "D."
It belongs to my son, David.
Have you ever seen such a hair type before?
- Have you noticed their nails?
- Yes, they're narrower than ours.
Covering less of the upper surface of the digit, but as flat as normal nails.
- What did the blood test show?
- It's too early to tell.
The blood circulating at present is still that of the mother's group.
So they're apparently normal children with these exceptions:
Strange eyes, arresting, I would say... an unknown hair group, and unusual finger nails.
Whatever they are, their physical development is absolutely startling.
In point of time, they're four months old... but their development and capabilities is that of 18 months.
No, please, stop it.
Won't stop.
She won't stop!
What happened?
I was giving David his bottle.
I must have forgotten to test it.
It was too hot for him.
He spat it out.
He just seemed to glare at her.
Get my bag from the car.
Is that any reason to scald yourself?
This box is a product of Oriental ingenuity.
There are no visible means of opening it... but if you do just what I've shown you, it comes open.
Now see if you can do it.
That goes down.
Now you've got it.
Splendid.
It shows I was right to marry your sister.
Your family has brains.
Let's see if I can do this myself.
There you go.
Now watch this.
And remember that he's only 1 year old.
Go on, open it, David.
Yes, there's something inside.
It's a chocolate.
Come along, it's time for your bath.
- This is fantastic.
- You think so?
Come with me.
It's all right, it's only a box with a chocolate in it.
I don't know, sir.
I never allow her to have chocolates.
It's quite harmless.
I just gave some to David.
But you didn't even show her how to do it.
That's exactly my point. I didn't have to.
If you demonstrate something to one of them, they all know it.
Now watch.
- I want that.
- Keith, give it back to him. At once!
No, Nancy, leave them alone.
Ted Brower! Come inside this moment!
I've told you about playing with those children before.
Where's my Philip?
You're always all together.
It's his turn to study. He's at your home.
It's his home, too.
You are anxious for us to leave, aren't you?
You have the same every week:
12 jars, 15 shillings.
You wish we wouldn't come here anymore, Mrs. Plumpton.
- I never said.
- It's what you're thinking.
You've nothing to fear from us.
However, in future, someone else will come for our order.
Goodbye, Mrs. Plumpton.
Good afternoon, Miss Ogle.
You ready, Gordon?
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.
Gordon, don't you think Anthea should know about this conference... what's being discussed?
There's no reason to alarm her just because you are alarmed.
I haven't got your cold scientific detachment.
People, especially children, aren't measured by their IQ.
What's important about them is whether they're good or bad.
And these children are bad to everyone but you.
But they are children.
Children are not born with a sense of moral values. They have to be taught.
- With their intellect that should be simple.
- Intellect. That's all you care about.
What if you can't teach them?
What if you can't put the brake of morals on them?
First we must try.
You're blinded by this vision of intellect.
You see David as an Einstein.
Potentially greater.
Solving the riddle of the universe.
Your son, David.
Anthea's son.
I have no proof that he's mine.
Where has Father gone?
To London.
You must hurry, David.
Why?
You'll be late.
No, I meant why has he gone to London?
He has some business there.
- What sort of business?
- A conference.
Don't you like me to help you, David?
Thank you. But I'm old enough to do things for myself.
Father agrees with that.
Darling, your finger.
Let me do that.
It doesn't hurt. Please don't fuss.
It might turn septic.
There.
You said I must hurry.
Goodbye, Mother.
Goodbye, David.
And, gentlemen, as the Home Secretary has permitted this disclosure...
I can now inform you that Midwich... is not the only colony of such children.
Here in a township of Northern Australia...
30 infants were born in one day.
But apparently, something went wrong.
All the children died within 10 hours of birth.
In an Eskimo community, there were 10 births.
The community didn't take kindly to this.
Golden-haired babies born of black-haired mothers violated the taboos.
None survived.
In the communist world... there were two time-outs similar to the one at Midwich.
One at Irkutsk, here on the borders of Outer Mongolia.
A grim affair.
The men killed the children.
And their mothers.
The second, in the mountains of the Northwest.
All the children survived.
Our reports, though limited... indicate that they are receiving education on the highest level.
All these time-outs happened on the same day as the one at Midwich.
This is now three years ago.
Have we established anything about the origins of these children?
There is very little to go on.
Zellaby, you must have some theory.
May I suggest that he may be somewhat too intimately involved?
My position as a dubious father is influencing my scientific detachment.
- Is that what you think?
- I have reason to believe so.
Well, let's hear what the others have to say.
Dr. Carlisle?
I went into the question of mutation.
Once in a great many 1,000 years, an abrupt jump may take place... in animal or in vegetable life.
A new variation suddenly occurs for no apparent reason.
Would that explain, why entire groups of people were... cut off for periods of several hours?
No, sir. It would not.
Very well. Any other line of thought?
Yes. There is the possibility of the transmission of energy.
May I put it this way:
Already, we can direct radar beams out into space with the utmost accuracy.
Electrical impulses have been bounced off the moon.
And we are continually receiving impulses from other planets and stars.
And impulses are energy and matter.
We're aware of that, Professor Smith.
But where does it take us?
The Professor and I think alike.
What we can do, others, elsewhere in the universe may be able to do better.
Exactly.
Let me get this straight.
You imply that these children may be the result of impulses... directed towards us from somewhere in the universe?
Of course that's just a theory.
But there's nothing to disprove it.
They may be a case of mutation.
They may be the world's new people.
What we need is time to investigate.
- Time...
- Just a moment, Zellaby.
Gen. Leighton, you told me of some developments at Midwich.
What are they?
A series of casualties, mostly among the village children.
In each case, after some contact with the others.
Children get into fights all over the world.
These were not fights in the normal sense.
No direct physical violence was involved.
But two weeks ago, a boy, a good swimmer... was drowned in the Midwich pond for no logical reason.
Children also have accidents.
Gordon, you've seen it for yourself.
The extraordinary power these children have.
And the sinister way they use it.
Extraordinary power, certainly, yes.
That's precisely why we need time.
It's only a matter of time before these children get entirely out of hand.
With fatal consequences.
So what do you suggest?
- That they be shut away.
- You mean, put in prison?
Bluntly, yes.
You might as well do away with them altogether.
- This isn't a police state yet.
- But don't you see what you're doing?
If you imprison them, you will deprive the scientific world... of the greatest opportunity it's ever had.
- Opportunity for what?
- For study.
Gentlemen, a great deal has been said here about the power of these children.
But nothing about the nature of this power.
What we are dealing with is a mass mind.
An entirely new development.
Like a colony of ants and bees.
These children all want to dress alike... and what one learns, they all learn.
I've demonstrated this to Alan Bernard.
They are one mind to the 12th power.
Just think what it would mean if we could guide it.
We could leap forward in science a hundred years.
At the risk of being destroyed.
What cannot be understood must be put away. Is that your view?
The age-old fear of the unknown?
On the other hand, Leighton has a point.
There is a potential danger here.
We're gathered here as advisors, as scientists, as government experts.
Now take a look at our world.
Have we made a good job of it?
Who's to say that these children are not the answer?
The answer to what?
To wars, to disease, to human want and misery.
To all of the problems we've been unable to cope with.
If they don't make an end of us in the meantime.
We can't throw away this potential because of a few incidents.
- What is your suggestion?
- I'll compromise with Leighton.
Let them live together, under one roof, in our village, where they can observed.
My department couldn't accept the responsibility.
I personally will assume full responsibility.
Just give me a year.
- Mr. Home Secretary, I can't agree to this.
- But all I ask is a year.
Surely that's not too much time when so much is at stake.
Just give me one year.
Very well.
I will officially recommend your compromise.
Thank you, gentlemen.
That's as far as we shall go today.
Our next lecture will deal with structure.
And by the way, don't forget you'll be living here from tomorrow.
Now...
Why do you smile? David?
You don't know how to put your question.
There isn't much point my trying to be subtle, is there?
The question I was going to put was...
By the way... just how deep do you see into my mind?
Everything that's in the front of your mind.
The thought processes, the reasoning that leads to my spoken words?
We still have to master that. It will come.
That's frank. Thank you, David.
At least I still have some privacy.
The question I want to ask is this:
Are you aware of life on another planet?
Then let me put it this way:
It is possible that life exists elsewhere, isn't it?
We don't seem to be getting anywhere.
Why are you so nervous when an aircraft flies above you?
You've very observant, Father.
That doesn't answer my question.
All right. Until recently, we haven't been able to make...
- our control reach as far as a high aircraft.
- And now you have, is that it?
What are you going to do with that power?
Father, we know what you're trying to find out.
It would be better if you didn't ask these questions.
We want to learn from you.
All right, that'll be all for today.
- David.
- Yes, Father?
I'll walk home with you.
What I meant was that you don't have to go, David, if you don't want to.
I'd rather go.
Because the others are moving into the school... you feel you must, too. Is that the logic?
- Yes.
- Your mother is quite distressed about it.
I don't really know why I should be.
Lots of parents send their children away to school... and David will only be half a mile away.
I suppose there is nothing that will make you change your mind?
No.
I think that's all.
Thank you.
I'm very sorry. It was all my fault.
You all right?
Mrs. Zellaby, I wish you'd be more specific in your testimony.
I know these things are difficult... but it is our obligation to determine the responsibility for this man's death.
I find it very difficult to remember.
You told Constable Gobby you heard the screech of his brakes.
Yes, that's right.
He got out of the car.
Then what did he do, Mrs. Zellaby?
Then he got back into the car... and drove straight for the wall.
Thank you, Mrs. Zellaby.
I don't think we need go any further.
It seems to me quite apparent what happened here.
Edward Pawle, the deceased, his vision obscured... came close to striking and injuring a child.
Then, obviously in nervous shock, struck the wall.
I recommend that you bring in a verdict of accidental death.
Mrs. Zellaby, you know they killed him.
Ask them!
Just ask them!
Who is that man?
James Pawle, sir, brother of the deceased.
Then I shall overlook this outburst.
Can't you see now that Midwich is living on top of a volcano?
A force is building up.
Sooner or later, it's bound to explode.
We still haven't any proof.
How much more proof do you need?
The death of James Pawle...
I'm much more aware of the situation than you think...
Why not? Look what they did to my brother.
- This won't bring him back.
- Who's going to stop them?
You can't stop them with that, believe me.
They're not human.
They ought to be destroyed.
Go home, Jim. I said, go home!
Leave here now before they get any closer.
All right, Mr. Zellaby.
All right, I'm responsible.
I've never denied it.
It's quite possible that, but for me, these two men would be alive.
I was over-optimistic.
There's a shindig in London.
They maybe after your blood.
Do you think I care a rap about that?
What beats me is that I failed to reach the children.
They're shouting for action, now!
Things have gone too far.
The village is very near panicky.
If only I could got inside the children's minds and read their thoughts... since, quite obviously, they can read ours.
Doesn't that assume they have thoughts in mind?
As we understand them?
Alan, it's for you. Gen. Leighton.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Yes, sir?
I see. Yes, sir.
It's as though their minds were surrounded by... a brick wall.
If only I could break through it.
Yes, sir, certainly.
Have I your permission to pass this on?
Right, thank you, sir. Goodbye.
I'm afraid there have been grave developments.
The Russian army group in the Western Urals... is equipped with a new type of gun.
It can project a shell up to 60 miles.
An atomic shell.
Apparently they tried it out yesterday... on the village of Raminsk, where their children live.
And the village of Raminsk no longer exists.
- You mean everyone there?
- The entire place.
They gave no warning, couldn't evacuate the villagers... without the children learning what was to happen.
They'd developed more quickly than ours.
They'd begun to take control.
An attempt to move them with the soldiers... proved disastrous to the troops and the adults.
I see.
So now I suppose we're going to blow
Midwich off the face of the earth?
No.
But in view of recent events, they feel your compromise has failed.
Leighton feels we ought to move, immediately, before it's too late.
Destroy them?
Well, they're meeting tonight to come to a decision.
They want me in town.
What I say is, it's got to stop!
Yeah!
First Ed, then Jim Pawle.
The authorities don't do nothing.
Are we going to wait until we all get wiped out?
- No!
- All right then.
Those that are with me, follow me!
David, come here.
I want to speak to you.
A man is dead.
We must protect ourselves.
- The law exists for your protection.
- It's of no use to us.
No use to you, is it?
If you think you'll be allowed to live by your laws... laws we don't subscribe to...
You're thinking of what happened to the others, in another country.
Yes, if you know about that you should know what to expect.
It will not happen to us.
- You little...
- It will not happen to us... because we have to survive, no matter what the cost.
I don't think you'll go to London.
We are now the only ones left... and you must learn that we are determined to survive.
And that there's nothing you can do to stop us.
You have to be taught to leave us alone.
Leave us alone.
He's out of danger now.
Go to the library, and I'll join you there.
I've never seen as severe a case of shock as this. It's medically impossible.
For a while, he was totally paralyzed.
Now his pupils are returning to normal... his pulse is less rapid, his color's returning.
I've never seen anything like this before.
- It's time London sent in some troops.
- I talked to Gen. Leighton.
Troops are not the answer.
The children would only make them shoot one another.
Tonight should be enough for all of us, even me.
- What is the answer, then?
- I don't know.
But no more people must be hurt.
Is there no limit to the power of these children?
No more than there is a limit to the mind.
- What do you want here?
- I want to speak to my father.
Why do you do these dreadful things?
Wherever it is you come from, you are part of us now.
Couldn't you learn to live with us and help us live with you?
I want to speak to my father.
The effect seems to be wearing off.
Maj. Bernard will be all right.
What we did was only to warn him... and all of you.
Leave us, Anthea, please.
You are not afraid of us.
No.
But I'm sorry, David, sorry I was wrong about you.
If you didn't suffer from emotions, from feelings...
- you could be as powerful as we are.
- Yes.
You'll never reach our minds.
I've come to say it's time for us to go.
Go where?
Away from here before they try to destroy us.
- What will you do?
- Spread out and disperse.
Soon we'll have reached the stage where we can form new colonies.
In the meantime, we've attracted too much attention.
You must help us to leave.
How would you wish me to help you?
You'll arrange a method of getting us away from here... without attracting attention.
You'll find a number of families spread over the country that'll take us in.
Yes, that'll take a bit of organizing.
I'll need a few days.
Yes. And be sure no one finds out.
Otherwise, more people will be hurt.
You'll tell us the arrangements you have made... when you come to give us our lesson on Friday.
You won't be able to deceive us.
You know that, don't you?
Yes, I know that.
Very well. Let us know your arrangements on Friday.
Good night, Father.
Good night, David.
A brick wall.
All right now?
Yes, sight's still a bit foggy, but clearing all the time.
I'll just go and tell Gordon.
You remember this?
You wore a dark blue dress.
Your hair was longer then.
It caught the moonlight.
- We're ready, Gordon.
- Good.
I wish you'd...
It's 8:15, you'll be in London by 9:30.
I wish you'd let me stay here or come with us.
You know that isn't possible.
I've things to do here.
And poor old Alan would go into the nearest tree if we let him drive.
Nothing like feeling useless.
You're still going to see the children tonight?
Yes.
- Every Wednesday and Friday.
- After what happened?
Especially after what happened.
I think I've found a way of getting through to them.
If I'm right, we'll have no further trouble.
How?
I'll tell you if I succeed.
Now come on, I don't want you to be on the road all night.
Here now.
- This isn't like you.
- I know.
It's silly of me, but I'm afraid of them... and I'm afraid for you whenever you're with them.
They won't harm me.
In a strange way, they trust me.
Why, even David seems to accept me.
Divorced from my emotions, of course.
All right?
Off you go.
Alan, look after her for me.
I'll give you a ring in the morning.
Yes, in the morning.
A brick wall.
I have to think of a brick wall.
I'm sorry, old man. You can't come.
Look after your mistress.
- What did he mean?
- What?
Why should he ask you to take care of me?
I don't know.
Just a manner of speech, I suppose.
What's the matter?
- Alan, I'm going back.
- Why?
I'm going back.
Good evening, children.
Tonight we shall talk about atomic energy... and how discoveries made about 100 years ago... completely changed our conception... of the elements and the place of the atom.
You were to tell us tonight what arrangements you've made for us.
The place of the atom.
It's 8:27.
Why are you nervous?
The arrangements, yes.
Yes, I'll tell you about those in a few moments.
But first of all, I want to finish my lesson.
The question of atomic energy.
You're not thinking of atomic energy.
You're thinking of... a brick wall.
A brick wall.
I must think of a brick wall.
I must think of a brick wall.
It's almost 8:30.
Only a few seconds.
Brick wall.

"The Merrye syndrome,
"so-called because its only known occurrence
"is among the descendants of one Ebenezer Merrye.
"A progressive age regression beginning about the tenth year
"and continuing steadily throughout the victim's lifetime.
"It is believed that eventually the victim of the Merrye syndrome
"may even regress beyond the prenatal level,
"reverting to a pre-human condition of savagery and cannibalism.
"Many authorities do not accept the existence of Merrye syndrome."
Incredible.
But true.
Nevertheless, I know only too well.
Of course, there's no Merrye syndrome any more.
It was extinguished for ever from the human race that fateful day ten years ago.
Can you tell me where the Merrye house is?
I said the Merrye house!
If there is any such place, we don't know anything about it!
Good. Get in.
Anybody home?
Anybody home?
Please say yes, somebody's home.
Hello in there!
Hello?
Hello?
I caught you!
I caught you.
I've caught a big fat bug right in my spider web.
And now the spider gets to give the bug a big sting.
Sting, sting...
...sting, sting!
Sting, sting, sting, sting!
Sting!
Virginia!
Virginia, are you crazy?
Now look what you've done.
You're bad. Bad!
Bruno's going to hate you!
Elizabeth? Virginia?
Elizabeth?
Virginia?
Elizabeth?
One, two, three...
Elizabeth!
Bruno, Virginia hurt somebody real bad.
You ought to hate her.
Elizabeth, how many times have I told you it's not nice to hate?
Oh.
Oh!
Dum, dum...
The one time I leave them alone.
And now this.
Elizabeth, I trusted you.
I left you in charge.
It's not my fault! I didn't do it!
She did it.
She was playing spider.
- You should hate her.
- No!
I left you in charge!
Virginia!
Virginia, you come here right now!
Ralph! Ralph, Ralph, Ralph!
Ralph! Ralph! Ralph! R-R-R-Ralph!
Ralph! Ralph! Ralph!
R-R-R-Ralph! Ralph!
Ralph, we're home now.
Ralph!
- Ralph, we're home now.
- Ralph! Ralph.
Ralph!
Virginia, now you stay right there.
You come and sit down. Sit down.
You too, Elizabeth.
Now, children,
I wanna tell you something and I want you to listen very, very carefully.
You remember last time when those two children climbed over the wall and Virginia almost caught them in her spider web?
Mm-hm.
Well, that got people wondering about us and that's bad.
Your daddy wouldn't like that,
Virginia.
Now, I can't be here all the time.
You know that I have to take Ralph into the city to the doctor once in a while.
And Virginia, you were supposed to mind your sister.
You were not supposed to play spider any more.
Now you never, never can play spider again!
Oh, Ralph, what have you got there?
Something that man had.
Ralph, give it to me.
That's it. Thank you, Ralph.
Huh.
This is from a lawyer.
Yeah, a lawyer.
What is this, Bruno?
Something bad, isn't it?
How many times do I have to tell you just because something isn't good doesn't mean it's bad?
I knew that!
It must be something VERY bad!
Nothing is VERY bad.
It isn't?
Huh.
He's going to come here and bring other people.
Daddy wouldn't like that.
What other people?
They want to... make...
They want to become your legal guardians.
"As the only other known surviving heirs
"of the estate of Titus W. Merrye..."
- Isn't that Daddy?
- Yeah. Uh...
"On the 14th of..."
Today's the 14th.
Now, children, we've gotta keep some secrets today.
Huh?
Urgh. What do you want that for?
Hurry up!
I wanna watch Uncle Ned.
You're not supposed to!
- Hey!
- Look out!
I'm coming, Uncle Ned.
I'm coming,
Aunt Clara, Aunt Martha.
I'm coming, Uncle Ned.
Emily!
I mean, I wish you'd kind of...
Peter, if you don't like my driving, you may feel free to take a trolley.
Now, wait just a minute.
This was not my idea.
I've never heard of the Merrye family!
What is that?
They're our cousins, darling.
It behoves us to meet them.
All right. I mean, you know, all right, but remember that it was not my idea, OK?
Of course not, darling.
You don't have ideas, baby Peter brother.
- Hm.
- Huh!
What makes you think this is the right road?
It's got to be!
Ha! There, you see!
Hm.
So...
This...
...is it.
I don't see any sign of whatshisname?
Uh, the lawyer.
Obviously, he hasn't arrived as yet.
The caretaker here probably went to meet him in a horse and buggy.
Might as well go on up.
They'll be along any minute.
Why don't we...?
What's the matter, Peter?
Chicken?
I just don't think it's right to go barging in on somebody that you're about to sue.
Well, just remember we're trying to avoid that expense, if possible.
Well, I'll leave that up to you.
What happened?
You saw a ghost, right?
Don't be funny!
There was a... There was an awful...
A baboon!
Well, let's not have a complete double-duck fit.
Uh, Mr Schlocker,
I think he means that you open the window from inside.
Hm, yes.
What's going on here?
Why have we stopped?
- They're blasting up ahead, sir.
- They're what?
Blasting, sir. For the new highway.
Well, we better wait it out,
I suppose.
Yes, sir. They won't be long, sir.
Mr Sharker.
The name is Schlocker, Mr Bruno.
Oh! Please, sir...
Er, Bruno.
Just plain Bruno, sir.
Oh, very well, Bruno.
I wanna tell you I appreciate your cooperation in this matter.
I wasn't expecting it, frankly.
Cooperation, sir?
Well, yes.
To tell you the truth,
I was fully prepared to avail myself of the services of a marshal, should it be necessary.
Well, thanks to your cooperation it isn't.
I appreciate that and I'll do my best to see that you're not forgotten.
Forgotten, sir?
I... l-l don't quite understand.
Well, in the... in the disposition of the estate.
Um, I firmly believe that so many years of faithful service should not go unrewarded, no matter how ill-advised.
Thank you, sir.
Now, Bruno, I'd like to ask a few questions, if you don't mind.
Very well, sir. Go ahead, sir.
Now, it is my understanding that for the past several years you have been the sole custodian of the three children of the late Titus W. Merrye.
Is that correct?
As you say, sir, for some many years.
And that the same three children have never been allowed the benefits of any sort of formal schooling?
Oh, no, sir.
The Master wouldn't have allowed that.
And professional medical care?
Oh, on the contrary, sir.
I assure you there have been regular and frequent visits, sir.
You mean they're not well?
Well, er...
As well as could be expected, sir.
You see, they're not... ordinary children.
I'm sure we can all agree to that, Bruno, but nevertheless...
You see, they're...
Well, you might call them retarded.
Retarded?
Well, I should think so, nearly full grown and never a clay of school.
No, sir. I-I-I don't think you understand,
Mr Sharker.
I'm afraid YOU don't understand, my dear fellow.
There are properly qualified institutions for the care of the... the deprived.
Especially when there are substantial estates to be administered.
Frankly, I find the whole affair rather shocking.
I may add there are proper judicial remedies for such abuses.
I don't think the Master would like this.
Come on, buddy.
Let's get this car out of here.
Yes sir.
Ah, my dear Miss Howe.
So nice to see you here!
And the young Mr Howe!
- Hi, Schlocker. How are you?
- Good to see you, my boy.
Pete, this is my secretary,
Miss Morris.
- Hi, Miss Morris. How do you do?
- Hi.
Skip the rest of it, Schlocker.
Let's go in and take a look at the place.
Oh, yes. I... I've been away from the children too long already.
You just follow me and I'll show you where to park your machine.
But if I may ask a favour, please.
Please treat the children tactfully.
You see, they're not accustomed to strangers and they might act wild if... if encouraged.
Now, ladies, this is your Auntie Emily and your Uncle Peter.
Elizabeth and Virginia.
That's two pretty names for two such pretty young ladies.
- This is Miss, er...
- Ann.
Ann.
Um, Ralph. Where's Ralph?
Ralph? Ralph!
Virginia!
Ralph! R-R-Ralphy!
Virginia.
Ralph!
R-R-R-R-Ralph! Ralph!
Ralph.
Oh, he's all right, Emily.
He's just a big kid!
Yes, it's like you say, sir.
He's just a... a big kid.
Now see here, Bruno, you don't seem to realise just how serious all this is.
Now, these... children are obviously in need of qualified professional care.
Wouldn't you say?
Well, there's a great deal in what you say, sir, but I gave their father a solemn oath that I'd never allow their unfortunate malady to become the object of public scrutiny.
Nonsense!
The days when we hid our insane behind walls of shame went outwith... with that old car of yours.
- They're talking about us, Virginia.
- I know.
But Mr Sharker, an oath to a dying man, that can't be taken lightly.
Now, Bruno, what do you mean by "malady"?
I mean... Well, I've seen backward kids.
Is it...?
Well, no.
I-I-It's... It's more than a retardation.
It's a sort of a regression, a progressive deterioration of the mental faculties.
A rotting of the brain, so to speak.
It... begins in late-childhood and... progresses rapidly, ultimately resulting in... physical deformity.
Rather like the last stages of paresis.
- Really that bad?
- Yes.
The Merrye family, or at least this branch of them, have been afflicted for generations.
And I'm sorry to say, sir, I...
I think this is the last generation.
What a shame.
Bruno, you mean all three of these...?
Yes, sir.
The unfortunate result of... inbreeding.
Never mind that now, Bruno.
We can go into that at the proper time.
Hmm... now let's see.
Yes, I would like to know the whereabouts of certain other members of the Merrye family, the two sisters of Titus W. Merrye and brother named,
I believe... Nedrick Merrye.
If alive.
Alive? Well, you might say so, sir.
Come on, Bruno.
Don't beat around the bush.
Are they around or not?
They're talking about Uncle Ned.
I know.
Well, I-i-it became necessary to put them in a... a more private sort of an institution.
My good man, are you saying that you...
...that the family chauffeur has been in sole charge of this entire estate and these minor children?
Oh, I never thought of it that way, sir.
You see,
I promised the Master that...
Yeah, we know all about that.
Listen, Schlocker, it's been a long trip.
I'd like to get cleaned up and get off my feet for a while.
We can go through this after dinner.
Dinner?
Yes, it is dinner time. Matter of fact,
Bruno, we intend to spend the night.
Oh, no, sir.
That's quite impossible.
Why, why...
We're not prepared for guests.
There seems to be a difference of opinion as to who is the guest and who the host here.
You do have food in the house, don%you?
Why, yes.
Y-Y-You see, our diet is very austere.
But I-l suppose we could find something.
Yes. Yes, I suppose we could!
Uh-huh.
I smell a bug.
A...
...big, black, juicy...
I am proud of you, Virginia.
You're doing so well.
Ralph is ready, Bruno.
Oh, thank you, Elizabeth.
Bring him right down.
My dear, there's no doubt in my mind that we have here an absolutely clear-cut
prima facie open-and-shut case.
Great. Now, all I want to know is what is it worth in dollars and cents?
Well, that's... that's a little difficult to tell at this juncture.
Perhaps with an audit...
Miss Morris, give me schedule B.
Right here, Mr Schlocker.
Of course, this is only the visible part of the iceberg, so to speak.
With more information, we can project the curve...
Hey. Hiya, Ralph!
Everybody, look at Ralph.
He's gotten all dressed up for us.
Oh, yes, isn't he cute?
Ladies and gentlemen, dinner is served.
Well, at last!
Thank you, Virginia.
That was very good, Virginia!
Can I feed Winifred now?
Winif... Oh, no, no. Not now!
Can't she wait?
If she gets hungry, she'll go looking for something to eat.
Oh, in that case, you go right ahead, but hurry up, hurry up, all right?
I Will, I Will!
Hungry, Miss Morris?
Oh, yes. I'm famished.
Shall we then?
Well, there we are.
Er, just sit wherever you like.
We're not very formal here at Merrye house.
We haven't had guests in a long time.
No, it's-it's-it's been a long, long time.
I-I-I might add that it's a great pleasure.
You can sit down now, Ralph.
Winifred? Winifred?
Barney, you came back!
Naughty Winifred, you didn't tell me.
Virginia?
We're waiting for you.
Sit in your chair, Virginia, please.
Voila!
What... is that?
Well, that's rabbit, obviously.
Not bad, Bruno.
Looks done to a turn.
Thank you, sir! I hope you enjoy it.
We're very fortunate to have meat for our guests.
You see, we're vegetarians.
Vegetarians?
It's dead.
We don't eat dead things.
- Good Lord, man! Why...?
- The Master.
Don't say it, you made a promise?
It was no idle whim, I assure you.
The Master knew of the grave danger.
The danger?
Yes, Bruno, what is that supposed to mean?
Well, the Master believed, and he should know, that the eating of flesh would hasten the progress of their condition.
Now I've heard everything!
Wait a minute, Bruno.
You mean like that story about the lion cub who's tame until he gets his first taste of fresh meat, right?
I'm afraid it's even more serious than that, sir.
Well... whatever that is, rabbit or what... ever...
...I pass.
Well, it looks good to me.
Hey, I'll carve.
Thank you, sir. Carry on.
Oh, and I must tell you all you have Ralph here to thank for providing it.
Is that right?
Good for you, Ralph.
I'll... I'll have something else.
Thank you.
What do you call these?
Ah, a rare treat. Our favourite dish.
- We call it souffléd fungi.
- What?
Mushrooms, Schlocker.
- Oh, mushrooms.
- Yes.
A real staple.
They grow profusely on the grounds.
And... did Ralph...?
Oh, no, no.
Virginia provided these.
She has an uncanny knack for picking only the...
...non-poisonous ones.
Come on.
Let's not hog this stuff.
There you go.
Thank you, Uncle Peter.
Thank you, Uncle Peter.
Hey, Schlocker, you can't certainly say they're not polite.
Oh, Miss Howe, if you don't feel up to the heavier fare, perhaps you'd like to try some of our fresh garden greens.
Yeah, Emily. Here. Try the salad.
Urgh.
Allow me.
This thing isn't dressed.
Isn't Ralph a vegetarian, too?
Oh, yes, but Ralph's allowed to eat anything that he catches.
Oh!
Emily, this is very good.
You don't know what you're missing.
Oh, as I told you, our diet is very austere.
But it's most healthy.
That's great.
Everybody ought to eat like that.
Oh, we have our delicacies, too, but they're not in season right now.
Oh, no, no, sir.
You wouldn't want any of that.
Oh, no. I guess not.
Urrrgh.
What do you think about spending the night now, Emily?
You couldn't drag me away, Peter.
Good show, my dear.
I'm with you.
Oh, it's like I told you, sir. It's...
There's nothing more to say, Bruno.
Now, now, let's make things easy on yourself.
We want to be fair.
The sisters can move in together and you and... Ralph.
Well... we might do that.
Oh, no. No! I-It's quite impossible.
It's too dangerous.
You see, this is an old building.
The wood is rotten.
You'd... you'd have to know your way about in the dark.
Nonsense! The next thing you'll tell us it's haunted.
Haun...?
Oh, no. Nothing like that.
He means they're vampires.
Oh, yes, and werewolves.
Are you a horror film fan,
Miss Morris?
Oh, yes, I love it.
"Dracula", "Frankenstein".
And "The Mummy"?
Oh, "The Mummy". I love
"The Mummy"! The way he walks.
Step, scrape. Step, scrape.
Oh, and the Wolf Man.
There's going to be a full moon tonight.
Er... Er, Mr Schlocker,
I mean, I-i-if you don't need me any more tonight,
I could just as well stay in... down at...
There's an inn in the village.
As I see it, there are only two rooms, anyway.
Peter, if you took the car, do you think you could find lodgings for Miss Morris?
Yeah. I saw a motel, coming in, yeah.
Fine, fine. Good idea.
Be sure you have her back on time, young man.
- Busy day ahead, you know.
- Don't worry.
Thank you, Mr Howe.
You're very welcome.
Children, some of our guests are going to stay the night.
Would you come and help me prepare their rooms?
Yes, Bruno.
Spider!
- Ugh.
- Got it.
I hate spiders.
We have lots of spiders.
Do you like spiders, Mr Howe?
Oh, sure, Virginia. I love spiders!
Do you? Would you like to play spider with me?
- Virginia...
- Sure. I'll play spider with you.
Maybe tomorrow?
I'm sorry, Mr Howe, that we couldn't accommodate everyone, but I'll be looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
Me, too, Bruno.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you very much.
Good night, kids.
Well, Miss Morris, we should be getting an early start.
I'd like that very much, Mr Howe.
Hey!
This is the phoniest setup
I've ever seen.
There is something terribly wrong here and I intend to find out exactly what it is.
There we go.
Say, it's still early, Miss Morris.
Perhaps you'd like to have a drink at that inn in the village that Bruno mentioned.
I'd like that very much, Mr Howe.
Oh, and maybe a sandwich if you don't mind.
Virginia?
Virginia?
- Boo!
- Shh!
Are you going to kiss Daddy good night?
Mm-hm.
Elizabeth, are you scared?
Scared of what?
You know. Those people.
I hate them.
You're not supposed to hate.
You should, too.
They don't like spiders.
I know.
That little man looks just like a big fat bug, doesn't he?
Yes, he does.
You know what I'd like to do?
Is it really lots of fun playing spider, Virginia?
You bet.
Coming to tuck you in, Daddy.
Nighty-night, Daddy.
Huh?
Now, now, see here.
This won't do.
This has gone quite far enough.
Ladies.
Beyond the bounds of prudence and good taste.
I don't know what you people are up to here, but... but I'm going to have to call in the authorities.
Now, there are laws.
Criminal laws...
Kill him! Kill him!
No, this isn't right.
There are proper procedures.
Special remedies.
Please! Let me go, ladies!
Kill him!
Now we can put him right back in his own bed.
Bruno will never have to...
Please don't hate me!
I didn't mean to do it!
She made me do it!
She made me do it, Bruno!
Well, he was spying on us.
Well, he was gonna tell.
He was gonna tell on us, Bruno.
Yes, Elizabeth, he was gonna tell.
And don't you worry, Virginia,
I'm not gonna hate you.
I knew this was coming some day.
But it's so soon.
And you really and truly don't hate me?
I promised your daddy
I'd never, never hate you.
You did?
You ought to hate him.
Elizabeth, I told you it isn't nice to hate.
Children, l-l-I've got something
I want to tell you and I want you to listen very, very carefully.
A long, long time ago,
I promised your daddy that I'd take care of you and Ralph for ever and ever.
And then... came this Mr Shlocker.
He was a nasty, mean man.
He wanted to take you away where old Bruno would never see you again.
But...
...you hurt Mr Schlocker...
...and he can't do that now.
But soon there will be more
Mr Schlockers and they'll be nastier and meaner than he was and...
You won't be able to hurt all of them because...
...there will be too many of them.
They can't take me away from you, Bruno.
They can't make me go away!
You won't let them, will you, Bruno?
I promised your daddy I wouldn't.
I knew you wouldn't, Bruno.
I'm not afraid.
Well, we didn't have much time anyway.
Pretty soon Ralph, he'll be... ready to join Uncle Ned and Aunt Claire.
And then you.
We wanna stay here for ever and ever, Bruno, with you and Ralph and Uncle Ned.
We will. I promise.
For ever and ever. We will.
You know...
...I-I-I know where there's a nice new toy.
It'll do a wonderful thing.
A toy?
Yes! And you can stay up late just to see it.
- Can we?
- Uh-huh.
Now, I have to go a little ways to get it, but it'll only take me a little while.
Please don't go, away, Bruno.
I'm scared.
It won't take but a few minutes.
And I'll be back. Now...
Elizabeth,
I expect you to take care of your brother and sister and see that they don't get in any trouble.
Will you do that?
Oh, I will, Bruno.
Huh.
Oh!
Schlocker?
Schlocker? Schlocker?
Schlock...?
Schlocker!
She'll tell!
- Catch her! Catch her!
- Don't let her get away!
- She'll tell!
- Catch her!
Aunt Emily?
Aunt Emily?
Where did she go?
Aunt Emily?
There she goes!
Get her! Get her!
Hey, Liz.
Hey... are you really a Wolf fan, a Wolf Man fan, Ann?
Oh, yes. I think that's how every man should be.
Like a wild beast.
No vacancy again.
That's the last one, Ann.
There isn't another town for 50 miles.
I guess we shouldn't have spent all that time at the village inn.
Yes. I didn't realise how late it was getting.
You lose count.
They keep taking away the glasses!
I know, but I remember exactly how many.
Er, listen, there's nothing we can do except go back and spend the night with Emily and Schlocker.
Got it! Got it!
Urgh! Spiders aren't supposed to eat other spiders.
Cannibal spiders do.
Bruno! Bruno!
It doesn't sound like Bruno.
Oh, no, it's Uncle Peter and that pretty lady.
They've come back.
Virginia, you mustn't hurt anyone else.
Bruno will really hate you.
He will not.
Anyway, I like Uncle Peter.
He's not like that bad man.
All the same, they'll tell on us.
Would they?
Would they tell?
Of course, they'll tell. Bruno said there would be others, didn't he?
They're coming. What do we do?
We'll have to make a plan.
Somebody's up and about.
Good.
I hope it's not that Ralph.
Oh, Ralph's just a big kid.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure.
Hiya, kids.
Hey, Miss Morris and I are gonna have to spend the night here after all.
There's no room at the inn, as they say.
Good evening, Uncle Peter.
Uh-huh.
Er, is Mr Bruno about?
No. No, he's away.
Won't you come in?
Yes, do come in.
Ah, how about Aunt Emily?
Is she around?
Shh!
- Oh, shh! Shh!
- Shh!
There's really no need to disturb anyone.
All righty.
When does Mr Bruno get back?
Shh. He'll be along by and by.
Now, Uncle Peter, you just make yourself right at home.
Virginia, dear, you may entertain Uncle Peter, while I take care of the pretty lady.
Erm...
Er, it's all right.
It's all right.
I'm sure Elizabeth knows what to do.
Well, if you really think so.
Sure. Listen, Emily is very easy to get along with.
When she's asleep!
Well, that won't be necessary.
Ann will have Daddy's room.
It's really very nice.
There you go. See?
Thank you, Elizabeth.
You're really very kind.
Well... good night.
Yes.
See you in the morning.
Mm-hm. It was awfully nice.
This way, pretty lady.
I'm glad you came back.
I like you.
I like you, too!
You're a nice lady.
I liked you right away.
You're not like those others.
Oh, Virginia, likes you, too.
And Ralph.
We all like you.
And Uncle Peter, too.
You'd never tell, no matter what Bruno says.
You'd never tell. I know you wouldn't.
I like you, pretty lady.
Pretty lady?
And the big black spider goes round and round and wraps the bug all up in her spider web.
Virginia, what happens when the spider gets the bug all wrapped up in her web?
Ah-ha! I won't tell!
Ah! All right.
How long does it take to play this game?
Oh, we're almost done.
Oh, right.
Oh.
There now.
Hm.
Virginia?
Hey, what does the spider do now?
What? Oh, yes.
Um, now the spider does a little dance for the bug.
She has to tease him.
Taunt him.
And make him wiggle, so that his juice will taste better.
Virginia, I think we better play another game.
Uncle Peter, do you like that pretty lady?
Yes. Yes, I do.
Do you like... me?
Uh... When does
Mr Bruno come back?
Bruno won't hate me.
He promised.
Spiders like bugs.
They taste good.
But I guess bugs don't like spiders very much.
I like spiders.
I like spiders.
I do, too.
Well...
- Guess I have to sting you now.
- You have to what?
Virginia, what about Mr Schlocker?
Mr Schlocker?
- Hey, Schlocker!
- Sting!
Well, I have to go away for a minute.
But I'll be right back.
Don't go away... bug.
What are we gonna do with her?
Ralph can't let go.
What do you mean what are we going to do with her?
Don't you know?
You made this plan.
But I didn't have enough time to finish it.
She wiggles just like a big squiggly bug in a spider web.
Hm.
Uncle Ned could make her quiet.
No! Bruno would be very mad!
Anyway, Ralph likes her, see.
You mustn't hurt her.
Just make her quiet.
Now, Spider's very clever.
She very cleverly drains the vital juices from the bug's body.
And that makes the bug stop squiggling.
Would that make her stop squiggling?
Help me find something sharp.
Ralph?
Hold her still! All I need to do is make a little neat cut.
How much should we let run out?
Just enough to make her quiet.
Then Ralph can play with her better.
Look out!
Ralph?
Emily?
Ralph?
No, Emily, I'm in here.
Where you been?
For heaven's sake, give me a hand.
That little fiend tied me up.
Peter!
I'm coming, Ann! Hold on!
Help me!
Children?
That lady hurt Ralph.
Ralph will be all well very soon.
I brought that wonderful surprise
I promised you.
Let me see it! Let me see it!
What is it?
Uh-Uh-Uh! This is a secret surprise.
Oh, sir, I don't know how you got yourself into this predicament, but I suggest you leave the premises as quickly as possible.
Where's Ann?
Ann? Where's Ann?
Ah!
If I were you, I'd hurry, sir.
I'm hurrying! I'm hurrying!
What's it gonna do, Bruno?
Well, it's gonna make a big flash and go "bang"!
Oh, boy!
Lookie!
Uncle Ned!
Yes, it was quite an amazing experience.
But, for me, anyway, a lot of good came of this.
Um, being the only survivor, naturally, I inherited the wealth of the Merryes, which, later, turned out to be... quite vast!
More important than that, though, my wife.
That's our daughter, Jessica.
Mummy, may I go outside now?
All right, Jessica, dear, but come back into the house if it starts raining again.
Oh, I will, Mummy.
And so the Merrye syndrome was extinguished for ever with the family that carried it.
Er, my own branch of the family, being rather distant, we never suffered from the curse.
- Can I help you?
- I don't know.
The radiator's boiling.
It's never done that before.
I had the water checked on the mainland.
- You've got anti-freeze in?
- Yes, you're supposed to in winter.
That's what's causing the overheating.
I've taken my anti-freeze out during this hot spell.
This is the best I can do, unless you want me to drain it off.
No, not now.
Tell me, is the Swan far from here?
Take the next right.
You can't miss it.
In fact, I'm going there myself.
I'd offer to show you, but I think you should let this cool down.
Do I owe you anything?
No. That's all right.
This is the BBC Home Service.
Here's the weather forecast.
Most districts will continue to be extremely cold.
Temperatures will remain below freezing point, ranging from 24º in Northern areas to 29° in the South.
However, there are exceptional conditions on the Island of Fara.
Temperatures are said to be in the region of 90°, and still rising.
90 degrees and still rising!
- Surely it can't get any hotter.
- Apparently, it can.
Yet on the mainland it's winter.
This weather doesn't make sense.
Some rain wouldn't hurt.
At least it would cool the air.
Thank you, Frankie.
- Can I help you?
- Is Mr. Callum in?
I'm afraid not. He's on his way back from the mainland.
- I'm Mrs. Callum.
- Angela Roberts, his new secretary.
Oh, yes. My husband said the agency was sending someone this week.
I've a room ready for you.
I'll show you.
I'd rather like a drink first. I'm gasping, this heat is stifling.
Yes, of course.
May I have the pleasure?
My name is Stone, Dr Stone.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll have a lager and lime, please.
And so you shall.
Is this your first visit to the island, Miss Roberts?
Yes. It's very pretty. I had a drive round after I got off the boat.
It is hot, isn't it?
We usually have the same weather as the mainland.
I'm sorry, the ice melts as soon as it's out of the fridge.
- Same again, Bob?
- No, just one for Tinker.
I must be on my way. Just the one.
Oh, that's better.
If you don't mind, I'll finish this upstairs. I'd like to freshen up.
- Of course.
- I'll show you the way.
- Is this all right for you?
- Yes, it's fine. Thanks.
Let's have some air.
Oh, I see you're reading one of my husband's books.
Yes. I thought I should. Is his new novel interesting?
He never talks about his books until they're finished, then he never stops.
- Have you worked with writers before?
- No. Mainly for publishers.
God, it's hot. It's like being in the Tropics.
When my husband gets back,
I'll tell him you're here.
- Has Callum brought my parcel?
- He'll be back soon, Mr. Hanson.
Tell him to bring it straight to my room.
- Well, he's not very polite, is he?
- No.
He's a strange character altogether.
- How long is he staying?
- Hasn't said.
We've been trying to puzzle out what he does.
Every day he goes out with his camera and masses of equipment.
He spends the rest of his time locked in his room.
He won't even let us in to clean.
Good material for one of Jeff's books.
Bob, what the hell are you doing?
Sorry, Jeff. I just wasn't thinking.
Thinking? You're lucky to be breathing.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
I thought I heard something.
I'm sure I heard something.
- Heard what?
- I don't know.
It was a sort of funny whirring noise.
Must be going off my rocker.
- I assume you've come from the Swan?
- Maybe I did have one too many.
It's this blasted heat.
Sorry again, Jeff.
Forget it. No harm done.
But take it easy.
Hi, Ken. Buying up the whole place?
We've got to keep cool.
The Met Station's like an oven.
They envy us on the mainland.
My publisher's threatening to pay me a visit.
Tell him to bring some snow.
We could use it.
Haven't you experts figured out what's causing this heat?
Or are we stuck with the villagers' theory that it's the bomb?
The bomb? To be perfectly honest, one theory's as good as another.
We haven't a clue. See you later.
If the heat or the DTs don't get you first!
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.
- Everything okay?
- Yes, thanks. Good trip?
Yes, apart from nearly knocking down Bob Hayward.
He was in the middle of the road.
How I missed him, I don't know.
Strange. He was all right when he left here, wasn't he?
- Is that Mr. Hanson's parcel?
- Yes. Why?
He's been asking about it.
He ordered it be taken to his room, immediately.
Did he? Must be important.
I'll take it up straight away.
- Yes, who is it?
- Your parcel, Mr. Hanson.
Come on, give it to me!
I forgot to tell you. Your new secretary has arrived.
- She's quite the modern miss.
- Really? Where is she now?
At the cove. She went for a swim.
I'll give you a lift.
Fine. I won't be long, darling.
- I'll be off then, Jeff.
- Yeah.
- Hello, Jeff.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- You know why I'm here.
- Then you made a mistake.
I hope you haven't unpacked.
You're not staying.
Come for a swim. It's fabulous.
Did you hear what I said?
You're getting out of here.
Don't shout at me. You always did go on. Cool down.
Now listen to me,
I'm not going through your special brand of madness again.
Aren't you?
For 3 months, I wrote nothing.
I nearly wrecked my marriage.
I'm not going through it again.
You can't just have a girl and then walk away.
Don't pull that on me.
You were no untouched virgin when we met.
How long was it before we tumbled into your bed? Two hours?
- You needn't wait so long this time.
- You haven't taken in a word.
- You're clearing out.
- Just like that?
Just like that.
What are you going to tell your wife?
That's my problem.
That you didn't like the look of me?
As far as she's concerned,
I'm just your new secretary.
You never did tell her about us, did you?
- What's that noise?
- I don't know.
Sounds as if it came from beyond the point.
It's weird.
Strange.
Bob said he heard a peculiar noise when I nearly ran him over.
Jeff.
Get dressed.
What happened?
I found him wandering on the road by his meadow, in a fair old state.
He keeps on about his sheep being dead.
What's the matter, Ben?
It's my sheep. They all be dead.
Someone's killed my sheep.
- Can he lie down somewhere?
- There's a couch in my study.
- How were they killed?
- Come on, Ben.
- I said how were they killed?
- He's in no state to answer questions.
I asked a straightforward question.
There's no harm in that.
- You found the old man?
- Yes.
- Did you see the sheep?
- No.
Only Ben wandering about, half out of his mind.
- Who's he?
- He's a guest. His name's Hanson.
Why is he so interested in the sheep? What is he?
I don't know. He spends his time locked in his room.
I'd like him to rest for a while.
- Give time for the sedative to work.
- Of course.
What do you think happened?
Do you think his sheep are all dead?
Who can tell? With this heat it's difficult to know what's going on.
Give Mrs. Siddle a ring, will you?
Tell her I'll be bringing Ben home.
Mr. Hanson...
Why is he so interested in how those sheep died?
- Why don't you ask him?
- How's Ben?
- He's calmed down.
- Did he say what happened?
No. Mumbled they were dead.
Nothing coherent.
The Doctor's not sure if it's just the heat affecting him.
Mrs. Siddle? Jeff Callum.
Ben's with us.
He's not feeling well. Dr
Stone will bring him home.
He thinks there's something wrong with the sheep.
What's that? I'm sorry,
I can't hear you.
Don't worry. He'll be home soon!
If the crisis is over,
I'd better start work.
Where's the typewriter and manuscript?
Mr. Callum?
- Jeff.
- You can't start.
It's in the study where Ben's resting.
In that case, I'll go and change.
- Yes?
- It's me. Can I come in?
Yes, come in.
Forget it. I didn't come for that.
You're here now, but let's get one thing straight...
Can you hear me?
Every word, darling.
If Frankie finds out about us, I'll break your neck.
Miss Roberts.
It's only me, Miss Roberts. I've brought you some fresh towels.
I'll put them on your bed.
Would you mind handing me one, please?
Thanks.
I could kill you.
- Jeff.
- Yeah?
Something's wrong with the TV.
The phone's been playing up, too.
It must be static because of this heat.
I'll turn it off.
Bloody set.
What's the matter with you?
That's funny. It's never done that before.
That noise again.
Stella, have you been playing around with the telly?
Of course I haven't.
I never touch the thing.
Oh! What was that?
Don't come in, there's glass everywhere.
- What happened?
- Get a dustpan and brush.
- But...
- Get the dustpan.
You don't want the dog getting cut, do you?
Jeff? Look, something's happened and I...
What's that?
I can't shout, I don't want Stella to hear.
But you remember that noise...
I said, remember that noise
I heard on the road?
I'll come over.
Stella, I'm just going to go down to the village.
I'll see if I can get a replacement set.
What a story!
- What?
- You're off to Jeff Callum's.
You men and your horse racing.
We can't keep any secrets from you women, can we?
Hurry up. You'll miss the next race.
Patch!
Patch, come back here!
Patch. Where...
Oh!
Here, Patch, here.
Who told you to come, boy?
You'd better stay, now you're here.
What's the matter, boy?
No!
No!
That's better. This was a good idea of yours.
My fingertips were sticking to the keys.
Some iced coffee will probably help.
Don't you get bored here with the isolation?
Bored?
Yes, I suppose so, at times.
But then, who doesn't?
It's the sort of thing you learn to live with in a place like this.
What happened to
Mr. Callum's last secretary?
Did she get lonely?
Is that why she left?
As a matter of fact, she didn't leave.
Jeff had to ask her to go.
- He sacked her? Why?
- She took a fancy to him.
That made her a complication and
Jeff doesn't like complications.
I can understand.
He's very attractive.
She was wasting her time.
She didn't mean a thing to Jeff.
- Of course.
- I'd have known if she had.
- Do you really think so?
- Yes, I'm sure I would.
But if he were just having fun, would you know?
Jeff doesn't play around.
It'd be all or nothing!
It's a pity that such an attractive man should shut himself away.
It makes you wonder what he's running away from.
What do you mean?
What are you getting at?
A man like that would need a pretty good reason for coming to live in a place like this.
It's obvious he's running away from something.
And it's obvious you don't know him or you wouldn't talk such nonsense!
Oh, but I do. I do.
I'm surprised Jeff hasn't told you about me.
He asked for me personally, didn't you know?
- Are you saying you knew him before?
- Knew him? That's an understatement.
You little bitch! That's not true.
Don't kid yourself he's different.
Men are all the same.
Within half an hour of me arriving, Jeff was kissing me.
I don't believe you. You're lying.
Yes, I am lying.
Why? Why should you lie to me?
I don't know. I was angry.
It's an automatic reflex when I'm being warned off.
You were warning me off?
Yes.
Yes, I suppose I was.
I thought I'd get a bit more written before opening time.
I expected it to cool down by evening, but it's getting hotter.
- Bob never turned up, did he?
- No.
I thought he said he would, just before the phone packed in.
What did he want?
He was on about some noise he'd heard.
Like the one we heard on the beach?
Jeff... You don't mind if I call you Jeff?
- No, not at all.
- You said the noise came from beyond the point.
Is that where the sheep were?
His farm is in that direction.
- Do you think there's a connection?
- Do you, Jeff?
No, I don't.
I'm the one who's paid to use my imagination.
The next chapter. I'd like it finished tonight, if possible.
I'll take my coffee and get the bar ready.
Jeff... May I have a light?
Your hand's trembling.
I'm the same. Feel it beating?
You know you want me.
Why try to deny it?
Quiet.
Listen.
Jeff! Jeff!
Something just landed over by the hill.
I was looking out of the window and it landed in the field.
- What did it look like?
- I couldn't tell.
- There was glow coming from it.
- A glow?
- Did it make a noise?
- That's what drew my attention to it.
A whirring, whining... whining noise.
- It was from that direction?
- Yes, I think so.
Jeff!
- Let's get out of here. I'm scared.
- No. I want to find out who it is.
Hanson! What was he doing up there?
Maybe he saw something land.
He wasn't coming from that direction.
Surely if he saw something, he'd still be there.
Maybe he wouldn't go over the hill.
Maybe it's something even he's scared of.
He's crazy. Whatever he's doing, he's obsessed by it.
Yes. She's right.
If we stay out here, we'll all have nightmares.
- Let's go back.
- Hold it!
You said you saw something.
That's why we came out here.
Did you or didn't you?
Yes... I thought I did.
I thought I saw something coming down.
It seemed to appear over the top of the hill and move slowly down.
But in this heat, I don't know.
Stay here. I'm going to take a look.
Jeff, be careful.
It must've been the other side of that high ground.
Let's get out of here. Wait till tomorrow, when it's light.
You can't leave us here and
I'm not going any further.
All right. But I'll tell you one thing.
I've had enough of
Hanson creeping around.
I'm going to ask him what he's up to.
Hanson, are you in there?
Hanson, do you hear me?
I can't talk now. Go away.
Open this door! Hanson, open this door, or I'll kick it down!
No. Give me a moment.
What are you doing?
What's going on?
Hanson!
Hanson!
The door!
Close the door, you idiot!
What do you think you're doing?
Never mind about me.
What are you up to?
This is my hotel not your bloody laboratory!
I want some explanations,
Hanson. If that's your name.
It is. And I don't owe you any explanation.
You do if you're using my hotel as a centre of your activities.
Were you out there to meet whatever landed tonight?
- Landed?
- You were prowling around out there.
What's this about a landing?
I came to ask questions, not answer them.
Yes, but this landing, what was it?
I assure you I can explain, but this is extremely important.
Well, actually it was my wife who saw it.
- Go on.
- She heard a whirring noise.
When she looked in its direction she saw something glowing.
- Yes?
- And she thought she saw it land.
- Where?
- The other side of the hill.
Do you know what it was?
- Well?
- Yes. Yes, I do.
What was it, Hanson?
I don't expect you to believe this, but for the past week
I've been convinced this island is the centre of an invasion.
A landing point for beings from another planet.
Beings from another planet!
Exactly. That's what has caused this inexplicable heat.
I've heard some yarns from villagers, but your theory is too much.
I'm not a superstitious villager. I'm a scientist.
I base my conclusions on observations of fact.
What do you suppose I'm doing here?
I've been collecting specimens. Soil.
Blood of a sheep. I've been analysing them.
You asked for an explanation, but you're too dim-witted to accept it.
You've ruined everything with your crass stupidity. Here...
Perhaps I shouldn't have broken in like that.
So you've been trying to photograph these things?
I haven't been "trying",
I did photograph them.
I used a normal lens at first, but it was ineffective against the intense light that emanates from these beings.
Remember that parcel you collected for me?
It contained this.
An infra red filter.
I experimented with a special camera and placed it...
Here. I used a mirror reflector and rigged up the shutter to be triggered by anything crossing its line of vision.
- And something did come through?
- Yes, it did!
I was developing the picture when you burst into the room.
It would've given me the proof I so desperately need.
Then what you've told me so far is pure conjecture?
- Cinders?
- Incinerated by whatever was here.
The same happened to the sheep.
They were burned to death.
There's been some sort of incineration, but it doesn't have to be a being from another planet.
I've analysed that, Callum.
It was burned by a high frequency heat, more intense than anything we can produce, even under strict laboratory conditions.
There's only one place where that kind of heat exists.
Out there, where the cosmic gases ferment and generate a heat greater than anything we can imagine.
That's where those beings must come from.
If you're right, how are they getting here? Where are they?
If we knew, we could destroy them before it's too late.
Tell me, has anybody else heard this whirring noise?
Yes, Bob did. In the lane, over by the gravel pits.
Somewhere in this area.
Here, boy. What's the matter?
Callum!
Come on.
I've found it.
Callum, look.
This doesn't affect you at all!
I appreciate how you feel.
I know he was a friend of yours, but that won't do any good now. Look.
Every particle of energy has been sucked out of it.
Hanson... We've got to warn people. They should be told.
No, not yet.
You forced your way in on me.
You had to know, didn't you?
Now you're going to do what I say.
The authorities have dismissed me as a crank, just like you did.
But I must have evidence, and I would've got it if you hadn't destroyed that photograph.
I need time to complete my tests.
- How much time?
- Two or three hours.
As for warning the villagers, we must avoid injecting fear into an already dangerous situation.
Callum, have you noticed something?
This heat, at this time of night it should be getting cooler, but it's building up.
- It's getting hotter, Frankie.
- I think you're right, it is.
- There you are.
- Thanks, my dear.
Oh, what an atmosphere.
They've probably heard about Ben Siddle.
I think I'd better finish that typing, Mrs. Callum.
No wonder the temperature's up.
Who's been hiding her?
Beer, Hanson?
Frankie, pull me a lager.
- Is something wrong?
- No, nothing.
- Jeff, I know you.
- There's nothing wrong!
I'm sorry, it's this damned heat that's making me jumpy.
We've been getting on each other's nerves too.
That's why I came here.
That shows how hot it is.
Smash the bottles! All of them!
- I'll get the first aid kit.
- I'll get it. You'll never find it.
What on earth's going on out there?
The heat exploded the bottles.
It's unbearable, isn't it?
- Here we are.
- Don't touch me.
I only want to put a plaster on your arm.
- Let Ken do it.
- What's the matter?
Let it go, Callum.
This heat is bound to lead to irrational behaviour. I'll do it.
I'll get Dr. Stone.
Come on, Tinker. Back to the pub.
It's all right. Come on. That's it.
It was Tinker.
He jumped me. Come on.
Callum, come here.
Look at the gas cylinder. It's split open, just like the car battery.
Completely drained of every ounce of energy.
Tinker? It's impossible. I can't believe he'd do a thing like that.
Not under normal circumstances, but these are not normal circumstances.
If this heat goes on increasing, it could drive us all insane.
The body isn't equipped for such pressure. The glands will fail.
Then, it's only a matter of time before the brain is affected.
A logical conclusion, but we should keep it to ourselves.
That's what Hanson keeps saying.
Two men have been killed.
- Two?
- Who's been killed?
- How's the girl?
- She's all right.
Who's been killed?
Will someone tell me what's going on?
I'm afraid Tinker's met with an accident.
Jeff, who else is dead?
You mentioned two.
- Bob Hayward.
- Bob! How?
It was an accident.
- Accident? He was...
- Callum, calm down.
These creatures are killing God knows how many, and that's your answer?
Creatures? What do you mean, creatures?
- He shouldn't have told you.
- What do you know that I don't?
He claims we're being attacked by creatures from another planet.
Claims? What do you mean?
You've seen them?
Bob Hayward and Tinker did.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
- Neither do I, Frankie.
- Here.
His thinks the island is being used as a test base for an invasion.
- Don't ask me why.
- It's quite obvious.
They have to discover if they can survive in our atmosphere.
- That's incredible.
- Is it?
We probe space searching for information about other planets.
It's logical that same thing might happen in reverse.
Are you saying that Earth has become a subject of a probe carried out by creatures from another planet?
Yes, I am.
And what I saw land tonight was one of those creatures?
Yes.
One of them, forming a spearhead to find out if life is possible for them on Earth.
And if it is possible?
Then, the main force will come.
Have you any idea what they need to survive?
Heat. The way that car battery and cylinder were split suggests they were seeking heat energy.
- They obviously need it to exist.
- Fine, fine!
We'll just wait for you to complete your tests!
The temperature has risen three degrees in the last half hour. 108.
At this rate, we'll all dead by morning.
I accept that the situation is serious.
The indications are that we're approaching a crisis.
- Hanson!
- Getting emotional won't help.
- We must alert the mainland.
- How?
The telephone's out of action.
What about the Met station? They can send a message. I'll drive up there.
Just a moment, Doctor. This could be very dangerous.
Someone must go. We've lost enough time already.
Very well. But don't go until I come back.
- I'll come with you.
- There's no point both of us going.
You stay and look after the girls.
And Jeff, I should leave that alone.
Too much of it doesn't help in a crisis.
This will help us keep in touch.
Aerial, press to speak, release to receive. Got it?
Yes. Thank you.
Good luck, Doctor.
- And be careful.
- Don't worry, I will.
These creatures, are they likely to attack us?
Depends what they're looking for.
I think they're looking for an energy source to keep them alive.
But once they've found it they'll spread to the mainland.
Yes.
Hello, Hanson.
Are you there, Hanson?
Yes, Stone. I can hear you.
Where are you?
I'm on the road to the point.
I've just passed White's Meadow.
I can see the outline of the
Met station in the distance.
The radiator's boiling up.
She's losing power.
How far is the station?
I'm not sure. About a mile and a quarter I should say.
She's slowing down.
She won't last long. The heat's affecting the engine.
It's very dark out here.
She's pulling badly.
The gravel pit's coming up.
I can make out the entrance.
She's stopping.
It's no good. I'll have to leave her. I'll walk the rest.
Hanson, I'm on the road.
There's a gap in the fence.
It looks like something...
- It's that noise again.
- Get away from there!
Get away! It's your only chance.
I can't hear you! It's this noise!
Stone. Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Get away from that sound.
What's wrong? Isn't it working?
Yes, Mrs. Callum.
The set's working.
It's horrible.
What now?
- It depends.
- On what?
Whether that meeting was an accident or a deliberate interception.
If it was deliberate, it means we're not dealing with brute monsters, but with a superior intelligence.
Which do you think it is?
I don't know, Mrs Callum.
I honestly don't know.
There must be an answer to these things.
We've got to try again.
I'm going this time.
Wait, Callum.
If you go out, you risk sacrificing another life.
The Doctor took the risk.
We can't just leave him there.
No!
I'll have to go.
I'm not being heroic.
Stone was taken by surprise
I'm better equipped to deal with this situation.
He's right, Jeff.
I'll take your Land Rover.
Have you got the keys?
Supposing they're still out there, what will you do?
If they are, I'll have to avoid making the same mistakes as Stone.
Keep these doors locked and that set switched on.
Lock the windows, Frankie.
Angela. It's all right. There's nothing to be afraid of.
I must've had a nightmare.
I kept seeing that man coming towards me.
His hands... I thought...
It's all right, Angela.
It's all right. He's gone now.
There's no need to be afraid.
Come on. Lie down.
I shouldn't think we'll hear from
Hanson yet. It's too soon.
You knew her before, didn't you?
- Who?
- You know who I mean. That girl.
- You knew her before she came here.
- No.
Don't lie to me, Jeff.
I've said I didn't know her.
I saw you kissing her in the study.
That doesn't mean I knew her.
Ever since she came here, you've been tense.
Just as you were before we moved.
Frankie, let it be.
You did know her.
All right, I knew her.
Leave it at that.
It wasn't difficulty with your writing. It was her.
- That why we moved here.
- Drop it, Frankie.
You're overwrought. The heat is affecting us all. Let it go.
Are you in love with her?
Answer me. Are you in love with her?
Not now, Frankie. We're fighting for our lives!
It's important to me. I must know.
Tell me, are you in love with her?
No.
- Then, what is it?
- I wanted her. I wanted her body!
Now you know. She was a slut and I wanted her.
But not any more.
I didn't ask her here.
She's no more than a common slut.
There's no comparison with what I feel for you.
That's why we moved here. It was completely physical, I promise.
She never meant a thing to me. She never will.
Where is everybody?
Where's the doctor?
He's not here. Go back to the study.
Get him! I need him!
He can't come. Go back and lie down.
He should be here. I'm ill.
I need him. Where the hell is he?
He can't come, you selfish bitch! He's dead.
Dead? Dead...
Dead...
Callum. Callum.
This is Hanson. This is Hanson.
He's found the other one.
Can you hear me? Callum?
Can you hear me?
- Why don't you answer?
- I can hear you. Where are you?
I'm at the gravel pit.
I've found Stone's body.
He's dead.
He's burnt to death.
Just like all the others.
The ground here is all scorched.
This is obviously the way they came.
I can see something. Something glowing down in the pit.
It's getting hotter.
I'm going in.
Hanson, remember two people have already died there.
It's horrible. What's he doing there?
It's very dark in here.
I can't see very far.
I can see it again.
It certainly is a light source.
The light seems to be...
I'm not receiving you.
- Hanson, do you hear me?
- Why doesn't he answer?
Hanson!
He's not coming through.
It's a woman!
I'll have to stop her.
Of course. The light!
What are we going to do? What the hell are we going to do?
The area beyond the gravel pit must be their assembly point.
I saw one down there.
What happened? The set went off. Are you all right?
Yes. The aerial must've been screened by the pit.
I've discovered something very important.
They're attracted to light. To them, it's a source of energy.
Turn out all your lights.
Do you hear?
Yes, I hear you. Is there anything else?
No, I'm going on now.
I'll drive without lights.
I'll contact you when
I get to the station.
Thank God he's all right.
He must've seen the creatures themselves.
I wonder how many there are.
I'll get the orange juice.
How long do you think he'll take to get there?
Not long... If he gets through.
He ought to be there by now.
- Why doesn't he contact us?
- Jeff, don't panic, please.
If it's possible to get through, he'll manage.
How do you know? How do you know he's not dead as well?
It's only five miles to the point.
He ought to be arriving any moment.
Intermediate frequency.
Range four...
Four miles? No wonder we haven't heard from him.
If he's at the Met station, he's out of range.
What do we do if he's out of range? Do we just wait?
- I can't stand it another minute!
- I want to get away too.
- We must go to the Met station.
- Anything's better than this.
We'll take your car. I know a short cut. Come on, darling.
I'll drive. I know the way.
We were in the office when the lights blew.
We heard the explosion and found the operator.
We got him to the wardroom but he was dead. Burnt to death.
That explains it. That finally explains it.
Would you mind letting us in on the secret?
Simple. Your station is the means by which these beings got here.
This station?
You must be aware that we've been sending out high frequency impulses to explore space.
Bouncing signals off stars?
Exactly. To us, these impulses are useful, but quite harmless.
But to these beings, they represent a life force.
- I see.
- Do you?
We attracted them, but that doesn't explain how they got here.
It's quite obvious, isn't it?
They must've homed in on your scanner.
These beings are composed of high frequency impulses in heat form.
They transfer like any form of high frequency.
They transferred here like a TV picture, from a transmitter to a receiver.
- Using our scanner as a receiver.
- Exactly.
- Then they materialised on Earth.
- Materialised?
In the same way as a satellite TV picture.
It starts in space as a signal and then materialises.
Do you realise what you're saying?
The Earth's surface is dotted with TV and radar scanners.
If these beings succeed, they'll heat up the whole surface.
Earth will be just another hot planet.
Like so many others in the constellation.
We've got to stop them. We must destroy them before they destroy us.
- Have you got any explosives?
- No.
Just a couple of revolvers and some ammo.
- We've got some flare guns.
- Get them.
Wait, the quarry. There'll be gelignite there.
- Anybody there you can contact?
- Like hell. I'll get it myself.
I'll be glad to apologise if we succeed. I'll take the van.
Whatever you do, don't forget: Drive without lights.
I'm getting to be quite a criminal.
She's slowing down.
She'll blow any moment.
Come on, damn you. Keep going.
It's that noise again.
I can hear it.
- Angela.
- Is she all right?
I missed her. But only just.
She heard you coming and panicked.
Have you seen Hanson?
- He's at the station.
- Good.
They got to us.
- Anyone hurt?
- Yes, the operator. Burnt to death.
Are you all right?
She's put the car in the ditch.
I'll give you a hand.
Here, sit down.
Under the wheel.
Right, start her up.
All right, push.
Put her in reverse.
I'll take Angela with me.
It'll lighten your load.
Right.
- Have you contacted the mainland?
- No.
Here, Frankie.
Here we are.
Fine. Tie them in bundles of three like I told you.
This is the plan. We split up into two groups.
- Is that a good idea?
- It's essential.
You know the hayricks out on the point?
Foster and I will go up there and I'll set fire them.
Wait. You said these creatures were attracted by light.
It'll bring them out into the open.
Foster will intercept them with the dynamite. I'll double back.
- What'll we do?
- Go to the top of the cliff.
As soon as the fires are alight, use the flares to alert the mainland.
- There's nothing else we can do?
- Has anybody got any better ideas?
It'll take us 15 minutes to get to the hayricks.
When you spot my first flare, it's your signal to move.
Foster.
Remember, 15 minutes.
Can you see them?
Why do you think Hanson split us into two groups?
If he and Foster fail, it'll be up to us.
That's what I thought.
He's a peculiar chap, but he's got guts.
Angela seems to be taking it badly.
If things get tough, will you look after her?
- Then I can take care of Frankie.
- Sure.
That's it. Let's go.
Listen.
It's coming from the meadow.
Come on. We must keep going.
- Jeff!
- I'll get her. Take this.
Lightning.
Foster!
Foster, get out of there!
Foster!
You fool. You could've run into them!
Let me go. Let me go!
- Leave me alone. Let me go.
- You'll do as I say.
In there. It'll be safe. Come on.
You little idiot.
Who are you to tell me what to do? It's my life.
You wouldn't stand a chance on your own.
At least we have a chance by sticking together.
I didn't ask you to come after me. Go back.
And leave you here? Oh, no.
Like it or not, I'm staying.
I hate you. Leave me alone.
Look, I'm just as scared as you are.
But... Well, we mustn't give up.
We'll find a way. I know we will.
- How many more flares?
- They're the last.
Whatever happens,
Frankie, stay close.
Callum. The storm, the storm.
Hanson, run for it! Run!
Run!
Aaah!
It's no good. Hanson tried to warn us.
They're all around us.
It's the lightning.
- I can't stand it. I can't...
- Stop it! Stop it!
I don't want to kill you, but I will if I have to. Don't stop me.
- You little fool.
- No, you're the fool.
I'd rather die like this than be burnt alive.
All right. Go on. Do it, but kill me first.
You?
Yes. You're right. It's hopeless, completely hopeless.
So for once, do something for someone else.
Go on, shoot.
Damn you.
What is it with you?
Don't you think I'm old enough to take care of myself?
Look. The rain.
It's killing them.
Sir?
I should like to see Miss Usher.
Well, I'm afraid that's not possible, sir.
Miss Usher is confined to her bed.
She's ill?
Yes, sir.
Is it serious?
Sir?
My name is Philip Winthrop.
Miss Usher and I are engaged to be married.
I cannot admit you, sir.
Cannot?
By whose order?
Mr Roderick, her brother.
He has expressly forbidden...
Then I shall speak to him.
I insist you announce me.
Yes, sir.
If you'll just come in.
Your coat, sir.
If you'll just follow me.
Yes? What is it?
Your boots, sir.
What about them?
Do you mind taking them off?
Taking them off?
What on earth for?
I'm sure Mr Roderick will explain it to you, sir.
A strange request.
This is the first time
I've ever been...
Sir!
If you'd care to put these on, sir.
Thank you.
Well, if we may go now.
This way, sir.
What is the meaning of this?
I---
This is Mr Winthrop, sir.
How dare you admit anyone into this house?
I insisted, sir.
I felt I had the right.
Well, we can't talk out here.
Please come in.
I gather you know who I am, sir.
If you please...
Mr Winthrop, softly.
An affliction of the hearing.
Sounds of any exaggerated degree cut into my brain like knives.
My apologies.
I'm afraid you're going to have to leave, Mr Winthrop.
I've come to see Madeline.
That is quite impossible.
She is confined to her bed.
Mr Usher, your sister and I are betrothed.
It was a mistake.
I don't believe that.
Please don't argue with me, sir.
You must leave this house now.
It is not a healthy place for you to be.
Mr Usher...
I have ridden all the way from Boston to see Madeline, and I do not intend to leave without seeing her.
Now, if...
Philip!
Madeline.
Madeline, in heaven's name, you must return to your bed.
Madeline.
You came all the way just to see me?
Yes, to see you.
Madeline, I must insist.
We shall talk later, Philip.
Mr Winthrop is leaving.
Leaving?
I'm not leaving.
He must stay, Roderick.
Please let him stay, Roderick.
Very well, he will stay.
Now, for pity's sake, return to your bed.
What happened?
I think your fireplace needs a screen.
Does it?
I was just admiring this painting here.
Is it your own work?
It is.
And you also play this lute?
I do.
Mr Winthrop, are you actually planning to marry my sister?
Mr Usher, during the time we spent together in
Boston, it never occurred to me that... and I dare say to
Madeline either, that we were not destined for each other.
When she left me, she said to me,
"I will love you forever."
Does it seem so incredible, then, that I would want to marry her?
If you only knew how incredible.
And I suppose this... this vision includes children?
God willing.
God willing!
If you knew the nightmare you are picturing for me, sir.
Nightmare?
That's what I said.
Why shouldn't Madeline marry and have children?
Because the Usher line is tainted, Mr Winthrop.
Tainted, sir?
You saw Madeline and you see me.
We are dying, Mr Winthrop.
As you saw her today, she is and will remain.
Believe me, sir,
I bear you no malice.
Were things otherwise, I should welcome you into our family joyously.
But under the circumstances it is quite impossible.
But why do you assume that... that you are dying?
There are many reasons.
Pray give me one, then.
Madeline and I are like figures of fine glass.
The slightest touch and we may shatter.
Both of us suffer from a morbid acuteness of the senses.
Mine is the worse for having existed the longer, but both of us are afflicted with it.
Any sort of food more exotic than the most pallid mash is unendurable to my taste buds.
Any sort of garment other than the softest is agony to my flesh.
My eyes are tormented by all but the faintest illumination.
Odours assail me constantly.
And, as I've said, sounds of any degree whatsoever inspire me with terror.
That's why your servant asked me to remove my boots.
Yes.
And even so,
I could hear your coming.
Every footstep, every rustle of your clothes.
I could hear your horse approaching, hear the clatter of its hooves across the courtyard, your knock...
The grating of the door bolt was like a sword stroke to my ears.
I can hear the scratch of rat claws within the stone wall.
Mr Winthrop, three-quarters of my family have fallen into madness, and in their madness have acquired a superhuman strength, so that it took the power of many to subdue them.
Do you not exaggerate, sir?
Perhaps there have been in your family certain... peculiarities of temperament...
Peculiarities of temperament?
How diplomatically you put it.
Peculiarities of temperament.
Would you permit me to light a candle?
I think you had better leave,
Mr Winthrop.
I think you need some light in this house, Mr Usher.
Two pale drops of fire, guttering in the vast, consuming darkness.
My sister and myself.
Shortly they will burn no more.
She cannot leave this house,
Mr Winthrop.
Believe that or not as you will, but she cannot leave it.
For her own sake as well as yours, will you leave now, please?
No, I will not.
Very well.
Bristol will show you to a room.
I have warned you, sir.
Whatever consequences may follow your refusal to leave... are upon you alone.
Yes?
Supper, Mr Winthrop.
I'll be down directly.
Very good, sir.
Agh!
What is that noise?
What happened?
Is it Mr Winthrop?
Philip!
I'm all right, Madeline.
What happened?
I'm not sure.
Philip, you'd better leave this place.
Please leave.
It isn't safe for you.
Darling, I'm all right.
I'm not leaving you, Madeline.
Mr Winthrop?
No, thank you.
MY dear?
You haven't touched a thing,
Madeline.
Don't you think... that crack in the wall should be repaired?
For future generations of Ushers?
For Madeline's safety.
It was probably the trembling of the house which caused that chandelier to fall.
Do you really think so?
Have you a better explanation?
While I was riding here,
I noticed a singular lack of vegetation in the area.
Is there something wrong with the soil?
The soil... Yes, of course.
Roderick, please.
As you will.
How do things go in Boston,
Philip?
Everyone asks for you.
Oh, do they?
They miss you, Madeline.
We all miss you.
Remarkable.
And you composed it yourself?
Yes.
May we have another?
I'm afraid
Madeline must retire now.
But I'm not tired.
Very well.
Good night, brother.
Good night, my dear.
Good night, Philip.
Good night.
I suggest we retire too,
Mr Winthrop.
Gladly.
I trust you will be prepared to leave tomorrow morning.
If you wish.
But if I do,
I won't be alone.
I intend to see that...
Philip.
Darling, darling.
I'm sorry I frightened you.
I didn't want to knock for fear your brother would hear.
Philip, I missed you.
I love you.
Madeline, I swear to you, tomorrow you leave this place with me.
If only I could.
You will, you will.
You don't understand.
May you never see into the heart of this horrible house.
Darling, once you're with me, you'll wake up from this nightmare.
Good night, sir.
Mr Usher, you fail to understand...
Good night, sir.
You cannot order my life,
Roderick.
Is it so easy for you to forget,
Madeline?
My life is my own.
Is it?
Yes.
I think this...
Is it, Madeline?
Do you hate me so much you want to keep me a prisoner here?
Hate you?
Oh, my dear. Hate you?
Don't you know that I love you more than anything in the world?
Can't you see it's my love for you makes me act as I do?
You cannot leave here,
Madeline.
You know what would happen if you did.
You know that.
I only know what you've told me.
Oh, my dear.
Do not delude yourself. I beg of you, do not delude yourself.
Sir.
I shall stay with her.
In the name of God, sir, will you not understand?
Leave my sister be.
Mr Usher, I mean to take her from this house tomorrow.
I will not argue with you.
Would you leave, please?
It will be all right,
Madeline.
Madeline?
Madeline?
Don't touch her!
You mustn't wake her, sir.
The shock could be very harmful.
How did she get here?
She walks in her sleep, sir.
And then she comes here?
She's obsessed by thoughts of death.
Poor child.
How long has she been doing this?
Ever since her return from Boston, sir.
I'll just take her to her room.
No, I'll...
No, no.
You might awaken her, sir.
Better let me.
I've done it before.
Good morning, Bristol.
Good morning, sir.
Has Miss Madeline had her breakfast yet?
Oh, no, sir.
I'd like to take a breakfast tray to her.
Very well, sir.
Of course, she doesn't eat much usually.
Then we'll see to it that she does eat.
Yes, sir.
Let's see what we have here.
Bread - that's good.
Um... milk, a little fruit.
I'll take it to her, sir.
No, I'll do it.
Yes, sir.
How about some eggs?
Sir, I think perhaps a little gruel.
It's the most that she's ever eaten in the morning.
Gruel?
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes, her sense of taste.
Well, all right, then.
Hot gruel... for both of us.
Yes, sir.
How long have you been with the Ushers, Bristol?
Sixty years, sir.
Sixty years!
Ever since I was a boy.
Then, this is as much your house as it is Mr Roderick's.
And Miss Madeline's, sir.
Not after today.
I'm taking her to Boston with me.
I see.
How long has that been going on?
So long
I'm hardly aware of it anymore.
It's just the settling of the house.
It can cause this entire structure to collapse.
And that doesn't worry you?
Oh, no, sir.
If the house dies,
I shall die with it.
Oh, be careful, sir.
It was about to hit you.
It could cause a nasty burn.
It's that fissure.
It causes the entire house to shake.
Yes, sir.
Who is it?
Your breakfast, Miss Usher.
Hot gruel and... hot gruel.
It's so dark in here
I can barely see you.
There!
No sunlight.
There'll be sunlight where we live.
Now...
Good morning.
Good morning.
If he comes in now, don't be afraid.
He won't come in.
He has to take drugs to sleep.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, now...
To fill you with hot gruel and good cheer.
You're so sweet to me.
Nothing too good for the future Mrs Winthrop.
Mrs Winthrop...
Open your mouth.
I'm not hungry.
Madeline, I'll have no scrawny woman in my home.
Open your mouth.
Come on.
Madeline, get ready to leave.
I want to, Philip.
Then you will.
I can't.
Why?
Because very soon
I shall be dead.
I forbid you to say that ever again.
It's true, Philip.
It is not true, Madeline.
You're full of life.
Look at me, Philip.
Do I look full of life?
I remember you as you were in Boston.
Do you remember?
You were exuberant. You were filled with the joy of living.
That's how you'll be again when you leave here and become my wife.
I wish you could understand.
Then let me understand, Madeline.
Let me, so that I can help you.
Perhaps you'll feel differently after you've seen.
Where are we going?
You'll see.
Careful, darling.
You don't want to go in there.
I want you to see.
Put your weight against it.
Here they all are.
The Ushers.
It's the lack of air in here.
It's the air itself.
Nothing can survive it long.
My great-grandfather.
His wife.
My grandfather.
My grandmother.
My father.
My mother.
This is monstrous!
Whose idea was this?
Your dear brother's?
There's one for him too.
Does that absolve him?
It waits for me.
No, it does not.
They all wait for me.
Oh, Madeline, Madeline, you must stop this.
Can't you see what you're doing to yourself?
You don't understand.
I understand, but you must leave the dead to themselves.
Oh, Madeline, come away with me now.
What have you done?
Give her to me.
Thank you.
See to the crypt, will you?
Yes, sir.
Well, are you content now,
Mr Winthrop?
It is not I who force her to live in a cemetery.
Do you think that I wish her harm?
I think you still do not understand.
And I think it's time that you did.
The tarn is very deep.
One of the Usher women drowned herself in it.
She was never found.
I dare say it's deep enough to swallow this house entire.
I'm waiting, Mr Usher.
Last night you asked me about the singular aridity of the land around this house.
Once this land was fertile.
Farms abounded. Earth yielded her riches at harvest time.
There were trees and plant life, flowers, fields of grain.
There was great beauty here.
At that time this water was clear and fresh.
Swans glided upon its crystal surface.
Animals came to its bank, trustingly, to drink.
But this was long before my time.
Why do you tell me these things?
And then something crept across the land and blighted it.
The trees lost their foliage.
The flowers languished and died.
Shrubs grew brown and shrivelled.
The grain fields perished.
The lakes and ponds became black and stagnant.
And the land withered as before a plague.
A plague?
Yes, Mr Winthrop.
A plague of evil.
Anthony Usher.
Thief, usurer... merchant of flesh.
Bernard Usher.
Swindler, forger, jewel thief, drug addict.
Francis Usher.
Professional assassin.
Vivian Usher. Blackmailer... harlot, murderess.
She died in the madhouse.
Captain David Usher.
Smuggler, slave-trader... mass murderer.
Mr Usher, I don't see that this has anything to do with Madeline and myself.
I don't believe in the sins of the fathers being visited upon the children.
You do not, sir?
The House of Usher seems to you, then, normal?
The house, sir, is neither normal nor abnormal.
It is only a house.
You are very wrong,
Mr Winthrop.
This house is centuries old.
It was brought here from England.
And with it every evil rooted in its stones.
You really believe this!
Evil is not just a word, it is a reality.
Like any living thing, it can be created.
It was created by these people.
The history of the Ushers is a history of savage degradations.
First in England, and then in New England.
And always in this house.
Always in this house.
The pall of evil which fills it is no illusion.
For hundreds of years, foul thoughts and foul deeds have been committed within its walls.
The house itself is evil now.
No, I... I cannot believe this.
But you must.
For Madeline's sake, you must.
Most of all does this evil reside in her.
And this is your dreadful secret?
Mr Winthrop, do you think those coals jumping from the fire onto you were an accident?
Do you think that chandelier falling was an accident?
Do you think that falling casket was an accident?
Are you trying to tell me that the house made those things happen?
Yes.
Oh, no, sir.
That's ridiculous.
But even if it were true... even if this house were full of evil, Madeline is not.
Nor, for all of your talk, are you.
You cannot take my sister out of this house.
If she were to wed and bear children, the Usher evil would spread anew - malignant, cancerous.
You are mad. I will not listen to you.
Yes, you will.
No, I will not!
I'll tell you what's evil in this house, sir. You!
I will not let your sickened fancies destroy Madeline's life!
She leaves with me today.
Who is it?
We're leaving... now.
Philip...
Madeline, you have no other choice.
If you remain here, this house will destroy you.
Then you know.
Your brother has poisoned you with his absurdities.
This entire atmosphere of sickness and disillusion is his doing.
Madeline, there's nothing wrong with you that leaving this house won't cure.
Do you love me?
You know I do.
Then leave with me now.
I Will.
Pack just a few belongings.
I'll get my things ready.
How will we go?
You'll ride with me.
Later on we'll get a coach to Boston.
Oh, Philip, can it truly be?
Darling, within an hour we'll be away from here.
I love you.
I love you.
Pack, quickly.
No, Roderick.
No, I will not listen.
I've been here long enough.
Please let me go.
I don't care what you say!
You can't keep me here!
You have no right.
I say you can't go.
No, I will not listen.
Please let me go.
There may be no hope for you, but there is for me.
I say I will!
Madeline.
I must leave, Roderick. Please let me.
Madeline!
I don't care what you say.
There's nothing you can say,
Roderick. I will leave!
Madeline, open the door.
Madeline!
What have you done to her?
Madeline?
Madeline.
Madeline.
No.
No.
Madeline?
Madeline?
No.
Yes, she's dead.
I told you she could never leave this house.
What did you do to her?
I didn't touch her.
You killed her!
There is no mark on her.
You are the one who killed her.
I...
I told you she was not well, and yet you persisted.
Her heart could not withstand the strain you put upon it.
No.
It's no matter now.
At least she has been spared the agony of trying to escape.
One candle left to burn now... before the darkness comes.
At least... she has found peace now.
Has she?
Why do you say that?
Because I do not believe that for the Ushers there is peace hereafter.
Is there no end to your horrors?
No.
None whatever.
For they are not mine alone.
Mere passage from the flesh cannot undo centuries of evil.
There can be no peace without penalty.
Yet you wanted her to die.
Wanted?
Yes!
I did not wish her death.
I only knew it was inevitable, as my death is inevitable.
Our blight must be removed from this earth.
What lies beyond is something else again.
Must you close it now?
She must take her place below with the rest of the Ushers.
One last look.
I cannot bear to look at her.
I'll carry her with you.
Bristol and I can manage.
I would rather, if you don't mind.
I'll carry her.
Come.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
Shall I prepare some breakfast before you leave, sir?
No, thank you.
Some coffee, then?
Yes, a little bit.
Very good, sir.
Shall I serve it in the...
No, no. I'll take it here.
You look tired, sir.
I don't suppose any of us slept much last night.
No, sir.
Bristol...
Yes, sir?
Do you think it was my coming that caused Miss Madeline...
Oh, no, sir. Not at all.
Miss Madeline was not well.
Her brother thinks I killed her.
It's just that he's highly overwrought, sir.
Yes.
Thank you for the coffee.
You're welcome, sir.
Don't recriminate yourself,
Mr Winthrop.
Miss Madeline's passing was not your fault.
She was very weak, poor child.
It was... the Usher blood.
There's such a history of illness in the family.
What with heart ailments, nervous diseases, catalep...
And the like, sir.
Miss Madeline was...
What did you say?
Sir?
You said catalepsies?
Did I, sir?
Was Madeline subject to cataleptic trances?
Oh, no, sir.
The truth! Was she?
No, sir.
That's why Mr Usher wanted her put in the crypt so soon.
Oh, no, Mr Winthrop.
Oh, my God!
No, you're wrong, sir.
You're wrong, sir.
Sir!
Mr Winthrop.
Mr Winthrop.
Leave her in peace.
In peace?
Mr Winthrop, leave her in peace.
Don't, sir! I beg of you.
Where is she?
I don't know, sir.
Tell me!
I don't know. I swear I don't know.
I thought she was here.
You knew she was alive.
I wasn't sure, sir.
You weren't sure?
Sir!
Usher!
What do you wish?
Where is she?
So you know.
Where?
You cannot find her.
Tell me where she is.
In a secret place.
For the last time...
Go on. You would be doing me a very great favour. Go on.
Where is she?
Don't touch me.
Where is she?
Don't touch me!
Where is she?
Dead.
You lie.
You buried her alive.
I did.
But she's dead now.
I swear it.
You swear it?
You buried your own sister alive.
But I had to do it.
Can't you understand that?
She was doomed.
Where is she?
Where is she? Where is she?
Mr Winthrop!
Where is this secret place?
Secret?
Bristol, you must know.
I know nothing, sir. Nothing.
I'll find her.
Oh, sir.
Was it necessary to...
You know that it was.
Madeline!
Madeline!
Please, sir.
Try to get some rest, sir.
I have to find her.
But it's too late, sir.
No!
Please, sir. Please.
She's alive.
Try to get some rest.
I know she...
She's alive.
Still here?
I suggest you leave,
Mr Winthrop.
No?
Then perish with us.
The old house crumbles.
Perhaps this storm will finish it.
You have murdered your sister,
Mr Usher, and I intend to see that you hang for it.
Do you?
Arrange it quickly, then.
If only I could kill you myself.
Yes, if only you could.
Yes.
Why did you do it?
I told you. Shh!
You will never understand.
To so logical a mind as yours
I have committed a murder.
If you only knew the agonies
I have spared you and the world.
If you only knew the agonies
I have endured on your behalf.
Did you know...
...know that I could hear every sound she made?
That I heard her breathing in her casket?
Heard her first gasp as she awoke?
Her first scream of terror?
Did you know I could hear the scratching of her fingernails on the casket lid?
You are mad!
Be done!
What?
I think I rave.
You said, "Be done."
What did you mean?
Nothing.
Is she still alive?
No.
Is she?
No.
Is she?
Yes!
Yes, even now I hear her.
No.
Yes.
Alive, deranged, infuriate.
Can you not hear her voice?
Where?
In the name of God, where?
Below.
Twisting, turning, scratching at the lid with bloody fingernails.
Staring, screaming, wild with fury, the strength of madness in her.
Can you not hear her voice?
She calls my name.
Roderick! Roderick!
Roderick!
Roderick!
Where is she?
No.
Give me this.
Wait.
Don't go down there.
Let her die.
She has the madness.
Mr Winthrop, please.
Leave her, sir.
Leave her?
But you may never find her.
The house is honeycombed with secret passages.
She could be anywhere, sir.
I'll find her.
But she's mad, sir.
Madeline!
Mr Winthrop.
Mr Winthrop.
Mr Winthrop.
Mr Winthrop, please.
Mr Winthrop, you must leave.
Where is she?
The outside wall has begun to crack.
Where has she gone?
I don't know. Please, I beg of you.
The whole house may at any moment...
Madeline?
No.
Madeline.
There was no other way.
No other way.
In the village of Nomen Tuum, an ancient Deer Well...
...is reputed to contain healing waters.
In certain cases, people have been restored to seeming health...
...but, more often have acquired a subtle beauty.
For this reason, the area has attracted the vain...
...and the corrupt as well as the infirm.
As a place of dark miracles, the village...
...has become a searching ground for demons.
Manifesting themselves as young women, the Succubi lure tainted souls...
...into final degradation, claiming them at the end for the God of Darkness.
Salt!
Are the marks on my face gone?
Am I young?
Beautiful?
Do you want me?
I want you.
What happens to a girl...
...who drinks too much wine in the middle of the day?
She gets caught.
What is my name?
I can't remember my own name.
How do you know I'm clean?
Are you?
-No.-
You're lying.
Are you hurt?
My forehead.
Wash it off... in the sea.
But I can not walk.
I'll help you.
I'll swim with you, naked.
He was very rich, sister.
Rich and foul and craving punishment.
Tell me about his soul?
His soul, ...sister?
His soul is tainted.
Corrupt and rotten, grained with black fibers.
How many have you claimed today?
Three.
An ugly child dying of hatred, a widower addicted to grief, and this carrier of disease.
You feel sad, Kia?
I am sad.
The God of Darkness loves you.
Then why does he make us claim these corrupt souls?
Why waste our powers...
...herding swine?
I am weary of luring... evil, ugly souls into the pit.
Why do we have to guide them, tempt them, seduce them?
They'll find their own way down to the sewers of Hell.
When wheat ripens, someone has to harvest is.
But why force us to do such ugly work?
Why can't the Incubus rise up out of the fires and slaughter them like sheep?
A soul cannot be forced to join the Legions of Hell.
Each one is given a choice...
...and when they choose to come to meet us, we then greet them.
Sister, I want more than that.
Surely the God of Darkness would welcome...
...the capture of a noble soul, clean and good--free of taint, without a shadow of corruption.
Sister, be careful!
I have powers, Amael, powers that must be tested!
You are young, Kia!
You don't know what goodness is!
I want to know! I want to find a
Saint and cut him down, corrupt him, crush him, put my foot...
...on his holy neck, make him rave and howl and bleed and weep...
...then send him plunging down to the inferno!
Kia... no!
Then, I would be a demon!
Then, I would be the Beast God's best daughter!
Sister, I warn you!
Keep away from the good!
They carry a power that rules the heart.
A great power, mysterious, profound...
...far beyond your understanding!
Power... what power?
They call it "Love"!
My Lord of Night, forgive your foolish child.
This water is sweet.
I wonder if it's true...
...that this water has healing powers?
Your color is better.
Fresh air brings me to life.
Your eyes are clear.
For three nights now, I've been able to sleep... without hearing thunder... without dreaming of battles.
You can walk now.
Your wound is healing.
It won't be long before you can run.
We'll plant this in the ground and let it grow roses.
So, Marc, you've decided to live, after all?
Marc--look at our faces.
It seems we think alike, so why don't we look alike?
You've got to confess, except for our name...
...no one would ever know...
...we were brother and sister.
People know.
They sense it.
The same blood, same heart, same soul.
Sister, for the last time,
I beg you, don't try to take him.
He is truly good.
Pious? God-fearing?
What is so dangerous in that?
He has faced death, Kia.
They all face death, all of them.
He was unafraid.
Is that so pure and noble?
The beasts in the fields have courage.
The smallest bird will beat its wings...
...and claw a weasel in its nest.
But his courage went beyond self-preservation.
When death appeared in a fire-storm, he would not turn his back...
...on those who had fallen.
He went forward into the eye of the storm...
...and brought each one...
...back to life.
I warn you, Kia, that quiet, modest man who seeks no honors, no rewards, that gentle person who seeks only peace, that man is a hero!
He is a mortal man!
A great hero, Kia-- great and good!
Then he has a soul worth fighting for!
There are no heroes burning in the fires of Hell!
No Martyrs and no Saints!
Don't try to stop me, Amael.
I warn you!
Be careful of protecting me!
Beware of pity and compassion!
Beware of tears!
Is this your land?
I live here.
Do you know the roads?
I know the Mill road and the River.
Six of us were on our way to work in the harvest.
The sign at the crossroad was broken by the wind...
...so we each took different paths.
Are you lost?
--Yes.--
When did you last have something to eat?
I do not remember.
Come, sit down.
My sister made some bread.
We have cheese and wine.
Arndis! Bring some food!
We have a traveler, lost and starving!
I'll get you some water.
I'm all right now. Thank you.
I drank from a well back there.
The Deer Well.
It's supposed to have healing powers, but it's probably not true.
You ought not to walk through the forest alone.
I have no choice.
Where are you from?
Avernus. By a lake.
It's not a pleasant place.
Why not?
A vapor rises from the water...
...and kills birds.
It's getting dark.
The way it does before a storm.
But I don't see any clouds.
It's an eclipse!
I've never seen one!
Don't look at it!
Your pupils open...
...and the flare can burn your eyes!
Is it a sign?
What do you mean?
An omen... of good or evil?
Some people see a dragon swallowing the sun.
But it's only the moon...
...passing between the earth and the sun, casting a shadow.
It's cold.
Only for a moment.
The cattle are coming in.
They think it is night.
Vespers at noon.
Te hens are going to roost.
I hope it doesn't stop them from nesting.
We need the eggs.
Are you afraid?
No. Not now.
Where is Arndis?
Safe, inside the house.
There, it's over!
Do you feel the light returning?
It's morning.
We've spent the night together.
It's time to go.
You're welcome to stay.
When wheat ripens, someone has to harvest it.
But you can't go on alone.
Not through the forest.
I can follow the shoreline...
...along the cliffs.
Stay here. Please.
Tell me your name.
My name is Kia.
Then let me come with you... for a mile or two.
At least until you find the road.
What about your sister?
She is safe.
Marc! Where are you? Help me!
Marc! My eyes!
I can't see! Marc!
I would carry you across, but I doubt if I have the strength.
It's shallow.
We can wade.
There's a path on the other side.
We can follow it down to the sea.
Do like the sea?
--Yes.--
Not so fast!
Wait for your military escort!
How can I keep you safe from harm?
Who would harm me in the middle of the river?
A water demon might jump up...
...and grab you!
The demons I know are like cats!
They don't like the water!
Kia! Wait!
One of them grabbed me!
Are you hurt?
No broken bones...
...but my spirit is dampened.
A fine guardian...
...you are!
It's a good thing I didn't let you carry me!
I can not get up!
Marc.
How do you know my name?
Your sister called you Marc.
We ought to build a fire.
The sun will dry us.
The sand dunes are as hot as a desert.
How do you know?
We have dunes where I come from.
Why do you question me?
I want everything...
...to be right.
Is anything wrong?
My heart is pounding.
Take me down to the dunes.
Kia, come back with me.
Back to the village.
Stay with us in the cottage.
We can lie in the sun...
...naked.
Together!
I want us to be together.
To stay together...
...as man and woman.
The right way.
I want to lie in the sun.
By the sea...
...at the land's end...
...the end of the world.
No one has ever told you what to do, have they?
No one has ever stopped you, or said to you...
..."no"?
I want you, Kia.
You know I want you.
But there is more...
...to it than lying naked in the sun.
I want your body... and I want to give you mine.
But our bodies mean very little...
...unless we also give our souls to love.
I don't have a soul!
Don't say that!
Don't say anything!
Don't talk!
My heart is pounding, too.
My hands tremble with desire!
I feel an aching like the tides, the sun and moon...
...moving close together, becoming one.
Come with me, Kia!
Let me show you how it's possible...
...we can become one!
Come with me!
I love you, Kia.
Sleep Kia... sleep.
I'll take you home.
Go back! Stop them!
Stop them!
Go back! To the Cathedral!
Follow the sound of the bell!
Marc is there!
Go to him!
Go to him!
Stop him!
Call him!
Call out to him!
Sister, what did he do to you?
He carried me... inside... to the altar.
He has defiled you,
Kia... befouled you with love!
Yes, he said he loved me.
He has violated you!
Sister, you must revenge...
...this holy rape!
Destroy his love!
Spit on his sacred honor!
Revenge, sister! Revenge!
He is strong...
...too strong for me.
Not you, Kia.
Split the surface of the earth!
Open up the pit!
Unleash the Incubus!
Incubus!
I can see you!
It's dark in here, but I can see...
...the candles and the cross.
Oh, Marc! Thank God!
Arndis, what happened? Tell me.
I've been blind since the eclipse.
I called and called.
I hunted for you.
It was like a nightmare!
You are safe now.
Your face, Marc!
Don't ask me.
I don't know.
I don't understand.
Where is she?
I don't know.
Something caught her.
I saw fear and terror in her eyes.
She screamed and fought me.
Then she ran.
Where did she go?
Out there...
...away.
Do you love her?
You don't know her.
I've known her, all my life.
I recognized her as someone I have loved a thousand years.
Then you will be together.
Let's go home.
It is starting to get dark...
...and I can see without the sun.
My Lord of Night, one of your daughters has been ravaged.
A mortal man has touched her heart!
Defiled her by an Act of Love!
God of Darkness, she is here before you...
...weeping with hatred, full envenomed, begging for revenge!
Incubus!
My brother, revenge me.
Death!
No! Don't kill him!
He is in a state of grace...
...and would die blessed.
I want his soul.
Take an eye for an eye!
It's late. You ought to go to sleep.
Are your eyes better?
Yes. I can see perfectly at night.
The darkness seems to soothe me.
I'll take you to a doctor in the morning.
You're not really reading, are you?
No, I can't.
Think about her.
If you feel like crying,
I won't hear you.
I don't mind is you listen...
...I am alive.
It is good that you have someone to cry for.
I love you, little sister.
I'll pray for her and for you, Marc.
The two of you, together.
Pray very hard.
Good night.
Good night.
Arndis... do you hear someone calling?
I hear a dog barking.
I can not rest.
I'll walk with you, down to the fields.
You're half asleep. Stay here.
I'll take a look around the whole area.
Don't go too far.
She'll lead him to the sea.
His sister is alone, waiting for you.
Appear before her as a young man.
Bring her here, to the Bridal Chamber.
Who are you?
What do you want?
Who are you?
Your brother wants you.
He told me to come and get you.
Where is he?
In the old house... off there.
He went inside to look for someone.
The wood is weak and rotten... the floor opened beneath him.
Is he hurt?
He is caught. Entangled.
I'll get my clothes.
--No!--
Let me see your robe.
Your night dress is white... for purity.
I can't catch my breath.
Don't close your eyes!
Look at me, look at me, come with me, little sister.
Come with me... come with me.
Say the mass.
He's coming home.
Hold her mouth. Don't let her make a sound.
She has no tongue.
Arndis... Oh, God, Arndis!
Marc... save yourself, save yourself... In the Name of God.
May her soul burn in Hell!
Don't kill him! No!
Let him transgress!
Let him smear his soul with murder!
Let him... Let him...
He is yours now.
His soul is stained with blood.
Come away. Come with me.
We can hide down in the marshes, near the sea.
Is he dead?
Look.
Did you see me do it?
You killed him in revenge.
Revenge?
I'll hide his body.
No one will know.
We can run away together.
I can feel my life... sinking down...
...down there... below me...
I can see clouds and light.
Marc, come with me!
Marc, come with me!
This fire is spreading down below us...
...you see it?
The earth is like plate glass...
...like a leaf of glass.
Look at the white hot flames.
A field of fire...
...rain and storms... whirlwinds!
I feel a breath burn my face!
My hands! Look at them!
Pits... ashes...
Kia, I see grimacing faces in the burning air!
Glimpses of the sun...
...luminous bodies...
...the man and the woman...
...the mother!
The night sky.
I see the heart of darkness...
...the universe unfolding...
...taking my breath...
...my blood...
...my life...
...down below...
...down below...
...down below...
Come with me!
Don't listen!
Marc! No!
I want to save my soul!
Your soul is mine!
No, Kia, my soul belongs to God.
I love you, Marc!
Help me! Help me, Kia!
Help me, Kia!
I love him.
He's dying!
Take him to his death, little sister.
Push your hero into the inferno!
Stop!
I love him.
You belong to the Prince of Darkness!
I belong to the God of Light!

You cannot bury her in consecrated ground.
- She was not Christian.
- This is my ground.
- It is the Lord's ground.
- Then let the Lord refuse her.
She will not rest with Christian dead.
She will not rest because she is not dead.
To me.
And she will not die because she willed not to die.
Is her will stronger than the Lord's?
These are her words.
"Man need not kneel before the angels.
Nor lie in death forever, but for the weakness of his feeble will.
- Blasphemy.
- Benediction.
Now hear mine. She desecrates the earth in which she lies.
And her will rots with her bones.
Both are as damned and dead as the devil's soul.
A nervous contraction.
Nothing more.
Nothing more.
So silent now?
Well, why don't you speak?
Or you? Or you?
Pray, speak.
Or has the cat got your tongues?
You must have met in hell.
- The fox may go to ground, my lord.
- Damn the fox! Where's my daughter?
Hey I say, where's my daughter?
Rowena!
- Rowena!
- Hello, Christopher.
Come on, boy.
Rowena, the fox has...
Don't bother the fox. I found something far more intriguing.
Ligeia...
Now puss...
- What do you want?
- I heard her scream.
She was thrown by her mount. I thought it unwise for her to move immediately.
In preventing it, I seem to have frightened her.
Yes, quite.
I thought the abbey was deserted.
- It is...
- Yes, but...
Save for myself, a servant and...
- Is she all right?
- Yes, quite all right, Christopher.
Verden?
Good Lord!
I never would have...
Those glasses...
The result of a rather morbid reaction to sunlight.
But I thought that... that not hearing from you, I...
I mean, after the funeral...
Perhaps you had better fetch the lady's horse.
Yes. Yes, of course.
Rowena... don't be frightened.
He's an old friend.
Lady Rowena Trevanion of Tromane.
May I present Mr. Verden Fell.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Terribly sorry to have trampled these lovely asphodels.
They're so bright.
The flowers of death.
How very appropriate.
Yes...
Perhaps you'd better take her in while I fetch her father.
That won't be necessary.
I'm afraid it will.
You aren't blind, are you?
No, no I live at night.
My vision is painfully acute.
Oh, no! No! Please!
Please, that light!
- I'm sorry. I only thought...
- No.
No, please.
I'm sorry.
Kenrick!
Sherry and some linen bandages.
The same cat?
Is it broken?
It doesn't appear to be, but it needs binding, however.
Ma'am.
Thank you.
You do that rather well.
Where did you learn?
I see.
Do you suppose I could make you smile?
Or do you ever laugh, Mr. Fell?
Only at myself.
- I see.
- Do you? You keep saying, "I see."
But I think your vision is even more limited than mine.
Rowena!
- Rowena!
- Here, Father.
- Are you all right?
- Lord Trevanion, may I present...
Oh, doctor here already? Splendid.
- No father. Mr. Verden... - Splendid, now are you sure you're all right?
- Yes father.
- Good. Well, I want to show you this.
Damnedest fox you ever saw.
Must be a freak.
The markings are so damn queer.
I've never seen anything like it.
Oh, Father, please.
Lord Trevanion, Mr. Fell...
Fell? Oh of course, the doctor.
Terribly rude of me.
Father he is not...
Here, doctor, have a look at this fox.
What do you think of it, eh?
Of course, I suppose foxes aren't much in your line.
It belongs to the species vulpas pallida.
Peculiar to upper Egypt in the Nubian Desert.
In Egyptian art, it is found at the feet of Ashtophet, goddess of ill-omened marriages... as her pet.
Hmm... Really?
Well I mean if it belongs in
Egypt, what's it doing here?
It was once kept here by the Lady Ligeia.
As a pet? A fox?
Who on earth would do a thing like that?
My wife.
I think we ought to be going now.
Christopher, help me on with my boot.
- Are...?
- I'm fine now, Father.
Have I said something?
- Of course not!
- It's all right, Father.
- Hey, the fox.
- In the wicker, my lord.
- No, it's not!
- I beg your pardon, my lord?
I said it's not.
Well, where could it...?
I mean, how could it...?
Well, perhaps you can tell me.
- Through here.
- But the fox was dead.
The cat was not.
It appears that the cat has made off with the fox.
But is that possible? I mean...
Were it not possible, the fox would still be here.
I trust that your ankle will give you no further trouble.
I'm afraid this is a bit awkward.
Do you mind if I send your fee by messenger, Doctor?
That won't be necessary.
Thank you.
Goodbye, then.
Well?
Has Ligeia's death changed him greatly?
He's certainly changed, but I never knew her.
- Was he always so morose?
- A bit mysterious, perhaps.
Do you like him?
I don't think so, but what has that to do with it?
To do with what?
Who one is drawn to, who one loves, even who one marries.
- Marry? Marry who?
- The doctor, Father.
Now you stay here, my girl.
Willful little bitch, ain't she?
Hell to be married to, I should think.
Her mother certainly was,
God rest her soul.
I'm told that Ligeia too was not without... willfulness.
Peperel! Peperel!
- Where the devil is...
- Behind you, my lord.
Damn me if I eat with
Squire Daniels again.
Bad breeding only exceeded by worse whisky.
From Mr. Fell, sir.
Please, see this reaches him immed... as soon as possible.
Christopher, I'm riding down to the village. I can easily...
That won't be necessary, my dear. Bye.
- Well, off to the assizes.
- The assizes, huh.
I've got an important brief.
How a gentleman can continue to practice law is beyond me.
- My lady, I...
- Thank you, Peperel.
Rowena?
I thought it was... Never, never, never come here unannounced.
Do you understand?
I do not like to be discovered unannounced.
Stop that! Stop it!
I'll get you something.
I can't send you off shivering like a frightened kitten, now, can I?
Come here.
Your hair...
It makes a shambles of the light.
Come along.
I dare say you've never had tea in the kitchen before.
No, I haven't.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Does she look like me?
Who?
The woman you seem so afraid will arrive unannounced.
Why did you come here?
To deliver Christopher's reply to your note.
Really to see you. Sugar?
I have nothing to offer.
You make me want to offer you something.
Pity prompts you.
There are people one pities without being drawn to them.
I suppose I even pity Christopher.
He's blinded in his way too, you know.
His life being simply law and logic.
To be so limited.
The beauty of such a life lies in its limitations and in accepting them.
Oh, I know.
I suppose I'm spoiled and terribly willful.
Willful? You don't even know the meaning of the word.
Now, I think you'd better go.
Why?
Why must I go?
Do you suppose I might be announced? I am expected.
Very good, sir.
You don't understand.
- I can welcome no one here.
- Not even in the kitchen of all places?
- Wait. Wait.
- Let me go!
I'm sorry.
Please, let me go.
Yes. Yes, that is, after all what I want too, isn't it?
To be let go.
Yes, of course, of course.
Pale and cold and... and yet, so much life...
It was her longing for life... only for life, that haunts me.
To want life so desperately, that when she lost it, her...
Her will to live remained alive!
My eyes see the shadows gather with shame.
Seeing you and seeing her.
Yet, when you thought I was Ligeia, you tried to attack me.
I don't remember.
Not very fetching, am I?
Morose, moody...
I stagger about like some drunken lord in some...
It seems as though you're always looking after my wounds.
Beg pardon, sir, but Mr. Christopher
Gough wishes to be announced.
He's in the refectory.
- Can I be helping, sir?
- Yes. Yes, Kenrick, please.
Take care of this...
Forgive me, my dear, but I must see Christopher.
- Forgive me.
- Of course.
Kenrick, bring the Lady Rowena into the great hall when you've finished.
And please fetch my glasses.
I believe you'll find them by the portal.
Oh, and Kenrick...
I want that animal destroyed.
It's wax.
It's a reproduction.
I managed to make it myself.
You see, I am loath to open ancient tombs... rob a nation of its treasure and call it archaeology.
- It's quite good, really.
- Thank you.
Twenty... first dynasty?
No, twentieth, but a delta dynasty.
A little known and less remembered.
You can tell by the eyes.
The eyes... they confound me.
There is a blankness, a mindless sort of malice in some Egyptian eyes.
They do not readily yield up the mystery they hold.
Verden... Verden!
Hmm?
- You were saying?
- Oh.
Oh, yes, yes. Of course.
Forgive me.
Forgive my reverie.
Lately, I... I seem to slip into reveries.
The Lady Rowena will join us presently.
And I have much to say to you before she does.
Christopher... not ten minutes ago, I...
I tried to kill a stray cat with a cabbage, and all but made love to the Lady Rowena.
I succeeded in squashing the cabbage, and badly frightening the lady.
If only I could lay open my own brain as easily as I did that vegetable, what rot would be freed from its grey leaves?
- Let's go for a stroll.
- A stroll?
A stroll, a walk. What the devil difference does it make? Come on.
- What was she, Kenrick?
- "She", ma'am?
Ligeia.
Perhaps none of you took note but it seems apparent to me she wasn't quite human!
So, what was she?
- Her hair was black, I believe.
- Do you? Excellent.
Black on one of her heads and green on the other, perhaps?
- Only one head, madam.
- How disappointing.
But her eyes, were they gold or silver? Ow!
- I don't remember.
- But she did have eyes, I take it?
Never mind, Kenrick.
If you don't want to talk about it,
I won't pry. Thank you.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
- Are you?
- Yes, ma'am.
Early this day, I found myself standing once again before Ligeia's grave, allowing me to observe a rather singular circumstance.
The date of her death had disappeared from Ligeia's tombstone,
And yet it was there yesterday when we came upon the Lady Rowena.
I don't know which confounds me more.
The defacing of the grave or the importance you seem to place upon it.
- Doesn't it seem to be a bit odd to you?
- Well, yes, it does.
Seems grotesque, as a matter of fact.
A malicious prank.
- Whose malicious prank?
- Good Lord, Verden, I don't know.
What are you trying to tell me?
Simply that this occurrence is neither a prank nor malicious.
Look at that stone, Christopher.
Consider what has been cut from the marble.
Not her name... not the inscription... only the date of her death.
Where's the date of her birth?
I never knew her age.
And consider, Christopher, how carefully it has been cut.
Surely not the work of any malicious prankster.
The ancients carved prophecies in their stone tombs.
- This prank is also a prophecy.
- Of what? From whom?
- Verden, this is surely something...
- Of return, Christopher.
Of Ligeia's return.
- Verden...
- No. No pray, hear me out.
These words were among the last she ever spoke to me...
"Nor lie in death forever."
"Man need not kneel before the angels nor lie in death forever, save for the weakness of his feeble will."
Ligeia's will was as fierce as her... as her body was frail.
Outwardly calm, even placid... she nevertheless pitted herself against death with a passion words are impotent to convey.
As her body progressively wasted, she seemed to turn to the very stones of the abbey for renewed strength, as if they could sustain that burning desire for life... only for life, that ravaged her as much as the fever of disease.
In a sense, Ligeia became the abbey.
She never entered or left a room, never walked down the darkest passageway without somehow illuminating it like a single moving candle.
Like a blind man, I could sense her presence, but I could not see her and even in the most trivial objects and actions.
Her voice in the rustle of draperies, the lightness of her footfall in the fluttering of a moth's wing against a closed window pane.
Even at the end, she seemed to have vanquished death.
She smiled and said,
"I will always be your wife... your only wife."
"I have willed it."
Have you ever tried to recall to memory something forgotten, being upon the very verge of rememberance and yet, in the end, being unable to remember?
No.
No, if I fear, it's... it's for my mind that I fear.
What, after all, is madness, but belief in... in what does not exist?
I believed in Ligeia, in her will... and I believed too well.
Consider the skill and the instruments required to cut the date of her death from that stone, and consider my skill with such instruments.
And consider my hand guilty with marble.
- I cut the date from that stone.
- And you didn't know?
No, not until now.
So, you see, if I fear, it's...
- ...it's for my mind.
- What? Why now?
Verden, you must get away.
You must find something.
Your work, or someone...
You're safe now, my darling.
You're safe with me.
When I was a child, we stayed by the sea in the small house on the hill.
I remember very little of my childhood.
I lived with my father in the wild country.
- What was your father like?
- He was a strong man.
His very manner was formed by the landscape.
In his forehead, you could see the line of the hills against the sky.
I feel I want to begin again with you.
Take me somewhere
I've never been before, somewhere new, for us.
In Celtic religion, Stonehenge was a temple to the god of healing.
It was built more than 3,000 years ago, and do you know why it remains today, Rowena?
Because it was built with a sense of purpose, stone by stone, like the pyramids in Egypt or like the Aztec towers in Mexico.
- Like our abbey.
- Yes, my dear, yes, like our abbey.
Where are we?
It won't be long now.
Christopher reached me by post when we were in Rome.
The papers for the sale of the abbey are almost all in order.
Tomorrow, we'll have a party to celebrate our return, and our leaving.
Well, here we are, my dear.
Come along.
Well for the moment, this is your home, Rowena.
Welcome home, ma'am.
- Your personal maid, ma'am.
- Ma'am.
Thank you. Oh, thank you.
They're simply lovely.
Oh, Verden, I...
As long as we have to stay here, you will be comfortable.
Verden?
Verden?
I tell you, it's not the fox, Doctor, it's the hunt. The hunt.
To pit your wits and that of a pack of hounds' against sheer animal cunning; it's more than sport.
For the fox at any rate.
Your bride seems in an unusually reflective mood tonight.
The journey no doubt tired her.
Yes I dare say. What news on the sale of the abbey?
Something rather awkward.
More difficulty over the estate lying in two counties?
- No.
- What then?
The deed to the abbey is in Ligeia's name and I can locate no certificate of her death.
- What can be done?
- Nothing without that.
- There never was a certification.
- But surely...
The county authorities would have insisted on ascertaining the cause of her death.
The confusion of the two counties again.
Each assumed that the other had seen to it. It's as simple as that.
It's not as simple as that. The abbey, much of the estate is in her name.
Should this be discovered, there'll be an inquest, possibly more.
No one. No one will go near Ligeia's grave.
We all hunt for different things in our lives, Baron.
A colleague of mine in Switzerland, a charlatan really, one Franz Mesmer, claims to have brought to ground some subtle and invisible fluid with miraculous healing powers.
Mesmer may be a charlatan, doctor, but the power which he calls
"hypnotism" is quite real.
- You know the man?
- No.
But I knew an interested disciple... one who sought relief from an incurable ill.
Were they cured?
- I say, were they cured?
- I think not.
You don't seem certain.
At any rate, hypnotism's effect on memory interests me more than its curative powers.
Through it, one is able to call to mind things long forgotten... or to forget things... best not called to mind.
And might we see a demonstration?
Remember, I can't effect the sale of the abbey until something more is done.
You see, legally, Ligeia is still alive, still your wife.
I await your pleasure, sir.
Christopher, I must talk to you.
Since last night, until moments before you arrived, I had not seen Verden.
And something else, something horrible...
Rowena.
We mustn't keep our guests waiting.
This is a very pleasant surprise.
Is Lady Rowena going to assist you?
Would you mind, my dear, assisting me?
- No.
- Sit down.
Kenrick, put out the candles!
Milord, I shall need your assistance too.
- But...
- Please.
Doctor.
Christopher.
Now, Rowena, just one thing...
What do you remember of your mother?
Well, nothing really, other than portraits.
She died when I was three.
- Now, my dear...
- I missed you last night.
You had but to come to me.
I never left my room.
Rowena... you must trust me.
Give over your will to mine.
No harm...
No harm will come to you.
Give over your will to mine.
Your hands are melting into mine.
Soon, very soon, they will be one with mine.
You will try, but you will not be able to...
You will try soon...
You will try soon...
You will try now, but you will not, you cannot move them.
Close your eyes.
Rowena...
- Yes?
- You may let loose of my hands now.
Rowena, you wish to let loose of my hands now, because when you do it, it will make you very happy... Very young...
So young...
All brightness, and butterflies are a wonder to behold.
- See them? See them?
- Yes.
There is one resting on a rosebush, one whose wings you can almost touch.
Reach out, Rowena. Touch those wings.
You can almost... No, it flew away.
No tears, Rowena.
There is no need to weep.
Your mother is coming.
Can you see her?
What is she doing?
What does your mother usually do when you are about to cry, Rowena?
She sings to me.
She sings to you.
What does she sing, Rowena?
Sing it for us.
I have a bonnet trimmed with blue.
Do you wear it? Yes, I do.
I will wear it when I can.
Going to the ball with my young man.
I have a bonnet trimmed with blue.
Do you wear it? Yes, I do.
I will... What a...?
Where...?
Who knoweth the mysteries of the will?
The will herein lieth which dieth not.
Man need not kneel before the angels.
Nor lie in death forever, but for the weakness of his feeble will.
I will always be your wife.
Kenrick, the lights.
Is it all over?
Oh, I'm so sleepy.
She'll rest more easily now.
I confess, I am somewhat confounded by what I have just seen.
Yes.
Should you require my further assistance...
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Don't go. Please, don't leave me tonight.
- You need rest.
- But there are things I must ask you.
Tell you.
Hush, my dear.
Tomorrow will be soon enough.
- Should you need me I'll be in my room.
- But, Verden, I...
Good night, my dear. Good night.
I...
Some things appeared in my room: a dead fox, a saucer of milk... Verden?
- Yes?
- Where have you been?
Alone.
- I was alone.
- But where?
Walking.
I woke, dressed and... walked. I was resting.
Verden, for whom...?
Why have you got that food?
- Why?
- Sir...
- Yes?
- I thought I heard...
Kenrick, can you explain this plate of food?
I, sir?
Yes. I seem to have found it outside of my room.
Well?
Perhaps one of the maids may have mislaid it, sir.
One of the maids?
Yes, well... look into it.
Yes, sir.
Oh, and...
Kenrick, the Lady
Rowena found some... some things in her room.
Have them removed.
I'll join you at breakfast, my dear.
In the meanwhile... rest.
Ma'am, please show me what has disturbed you.
I shan't be able to show you what has disturbed me.
Perhaps you could show me.
I'm truly sorry, ma'am.
I sleep alone,
I eat alone.
And that's as it should be.
After all, I'm not his wife. Am I?
It's a... a legal technicality.
Is it now? Along with the fox, the food, the saucer of milk, my hairbrush filled with black hair, with hers.
Are they just legal technicalities as well?
But you said yourself that these objects disappeared.
Someone else besides myself was there.
Christopher, did you imagine her words on my lips last night?
- Words I have never heard before!
- No.
That woman is alive. There.
From somewhere in the abbey, she comes to devil me, destroy me.
Somewhere in the abbey, her abbey, she's alive, and with her husband.
Let's walk for a bit, my dear.
Make me a promise.
Don't ask for explanations. We must be in a position to demand them.
By tonight, we will be.
Promise.
Ma'am!
Is there something else
I can fetch you, ma'am?
Just my husband, Kenrick.
I'm sorry to come upon you unannounced.
You always did stand on ceremony.
Yes. Yes, quite.
May I?
Oh, don't leave us, please.
- Kenrick...
- Sir?
Where is your master?
As I've told Lady Rowena, sir, he's working over some ancient treasure.
In his study? Splendid.
Then send for him.
He's not there, sir.
Where else might he work?
- I say, where else might he work?
- I can't quite say, sir.
You can't say or you won't say.
Which is it?
Now sit! Go on, sit!
If, Kenrick, you are unsure of your master's whereabouts, perhaps you could answer another question?
Yes, sir?
Where is Ligeia?
I'd have thought the answer to that an obvious one.
She's lying beneath a white stone and a carpet of pretty, red flowers.
Isn't that the case, Kenrick?
Of course, sir.
It was only that... that...
- Yes?
- It was such a strange question to ask.
Oh, quite.
Yes, quite.
Why do you suppose I should ask so strange a question?
- I... I...
- Go on, man, speak up!
Perhaps...
Perhaps the Lady Ligeia has wearied of her final resting place.
Perhaps she prefers the company of Verden to the dubious comforts of her coffin.
Or perhaps... Look at me!
- Perhaps she has never left his side!
- No, no, no sir!
Well perhaps we shall have to look into Ligeia's grave? And see...
Please, sir, no more. Please.
I've no wish to torment you.
Produce your master or point the way for me to find him.
Give me leave, sir.
You must give me leave.
My dear, go to your room.
Lock the door.
In no circumstances leave it until I return.
- But if Verden comes...
- I can't promise that all will be well.
But it will be done with. Soon.
- Have you another spade?
- Yes, sir.
Ma'am...
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.
These want water.
I'll take them. Thank you.
- Anything else, ma'am?
- No. No. Thank you.
Night, ma'am.
- That will do.
- Right, sir.
You've earned your ale tonight.
It's wax!
You must hurry, sir.
He's beyond my help now.
Verden?
Verden!
It's no use, Rowena.
He's beyond any of us now, beyond any shock.
Come with us now, Rowena.
He'll come alone when he can.
It's not his doing, ma'am.
It's hers! Hers! The Lady Ligeia's!
Her eyes!
Before she died, she held him with her eyes the way he did with you that night.
She told him she was not dying, would never die, but would remain here waiting for him, and every night, he must come and care for her.
Be with her. And during the day he must forget the nights.
And he would forget.
And yet, sometimes, I've seen him struggle to remember, struggle against her madness,
But the night always fell.
And with it her madness always fell upon him.
And did you never try to tell him?
When I tried, he became still, like now.
He wouldn't see, wouldn't listen.
He's still held by her word.
Only she can release him, and she's dead.
Verden...
Verden, you must trust me.
Give over your will to mine.
Soon, very soon, you will see standing before you Ligeia.
Look at me, Verden.
I am Ligeia.
Look at me now... and listen... and remember.
Remember everything.
Remember all I've ever asked of you, and when you do remember, you will be free.
My will fails me, Verden.
I am dying, Verden.
I am dying... and when I do... you will see me dead... and remember it all... all... all.
It's too late, Christopher.
She wants a place to rest.
Please... leave me alone with my wife.
Verden...
Verden...
Verden!
Verden!
So you murdered her after all.
Yes, she killed Rowena and I killed Ligeia.
But that's Rowena's body!
It's Rowena!
But it was Ligeia.
It was Ligeia!
Yes, Christopher, take her and leave.
Think me mad, think whatever you will, but leave this abbey now!
I know who is responsible!
Take Rowena out of here!
Hello, Christopher.

THE ANAN ARCHIPELAGO
KOJIMA ISLAND
Annabelle.
Joji.
Charly, what’s wrong?
Don’t send me back to the front!
Charly, pull yourself together!
What is it?
Charly!
I don’t wanna go!
Don’t send me back there!
I won’t go!
I don’t wanna go!
Drugs... gimme drugs.
Give him an injection.
-Captain! Come look at this!
-What/sit?
A swarm of insects!
Starboard engine on fire!
Cut the engine!
What’s our position?
Joji.
Parachutes!
We don’t have details yet, but it seems a B-52 bomber carrying an H-bomb has crash-landed somewhere in the Anan Archipelago.
You will all commence with
Operation Broken Arrow at once.
Lieutenant Colonel Gordon...
I’d like you to assemble a search party to look everywhere until that bomb is found.
Yes, sir.
These skeletons are crumbling.
Captain, take it slow.
Get away from me!
If you hadn’t flipped out, we could’ve avoided that swarm.
Give me some water.
-Me too.
-Get away!
Where are we?
Joji isn’t back yet?
No, he’s still out collecting insects.
You two just got married.
Why does he leave you alone all day?
He’s obsessed with rare insects.
Sure it isn’t an insect with smooth white skin?
What’s that supposed to mean?
Stop it! Let me go!
Damn it!
What’s all this about?
I’m Lieutenant Colonel Gordon,
U.S. Air Force.
Some islanders saw some parachutes falling.
That’s good news.
Where did they land?
On Kojima Island.
I’ll take you there by boat.
Over there!
-He’s alive.
-What could have happened?
He probably fell down that cliff.
-Let’s go inside.
-Come on.
Those are some nasty wounds.
Could they have died while bailing out?
No, somebody did this to them.
-Someone killed them?
-I can’t be sure.
I’ll do an autopsy right away.
Who could do something so brutal?
-Here.
-I don’t want one.
Hey there!
Wanna buy a watch?
You can have it cheap.
Just 10,000 yen.
-That’s a U.S. Air Force watch.
Whered you get it?
Who cares?
Did you get it off one of those pilots who parachuted down?
I don’t need stolen goods!
Suit yourself.
-Yukari!
-Jojil
Where have you been?
I’ve been worried about you.
Going from island to island, gathering insects.
Is that really what you were doing?
What’s gotten into you?
Don’t go getting suspicious.
I told you:
I’m gathering insects for Dr. Nagumo of the Tokyo Biological
Research Center.
I’m tired from hiking all day, so stop getting on my nerves.
I’m sorry.
There are lots of ways.-- a man can get tired out, eh?
-What?
I hear you have a plump white butterfly on one of those islands.
Son of a bitch!
Stop it, Joji!
You’re choking me!
Joji, please stop it!
I’ve got something important to tell you!
What’s going on here?
Nothing at all.
Is there a problem?
That’s him!
I hear you’ve got a U.S. military watch.
Well?
Let me go!
Joji, have you done something wrong?
I haven’t done anything wrong!
I’d like you to come down to the station.
I swear I haven’t done anything!
Are you saying you just found this on Kojima Island?
You’re lying!
You killed the pilot and took it!
You didn’t find it!
-You’re wrong!
-You killed two men to get it!
You’re a goddamn murderer!
I’m not! I swear I’m not!
Dr. Nagumo... a telegram came for you.
What happened to it?
This insect’s poison attacks the central nervous system, causing madness and death.
There are many insects we still don’t know much about.
This is one of them.
A young man named Joji Akiyama sent it to me from Yatsushima.
This is from him.
He’s been arrested for murder!
Dr. Nagumo!
-I got your telegram.
-Please help us.
Joji’s innocent.
I believe him.
There’s no one we can turn to here on the island.
I’ll do all I can to help.
Joji... thank you for the poisonous insects.
They’re a previously undiscovered species.
You mustn’t lose hope!
Hang on for Yukari’s sake.
Or did you really kill those men?
No, I didn’t kill them!
When I was on that island,
I saw the plane explode and the parachutes open.
Then I...
I thought I’d sell the watch and buy something nice for Yukart
You were alone at the time.
Is that right?
Tell the truth.
Or would you rather be tried for murder?
I was with a girl named Annabelle.
Annabelle?
There’s a reason for that,
I presume.
Don’t ask me to tell you more.
-Chief.
-Dr. Nagumo!
Please help me!
Don’t give up, no matter what.
Got that?
I’d like to see the pilots’ bodies.
I’m sending them to the base.
Make it quick.
They’ve been badly bitten by insects.
Cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage from blunt trauma.
But the wounds to the jaw aren’t from being struck.
Hard blows with a sharp rock could have caused those.
I’d like to see the black airman.
Your friend’s guilty.
You’re wasting your time.
-He’s still unconscious?
-Yes... but at times he mumbles deliriously.
“Insects, insects...”
“Insects”?
Insects.--
If he comes to, he may be able to help prove
Joji’s innocence.
I agree.
Who are you?
Dr. Junko Komuro.
The Red Cross sent me.
Pleased to meet you.
I know Joji well.
He wouldn’t kill anyone.
Hey, sweetie.-- how about waiting on us?
Dr. Nagumo!
Joji’s doing fine.
I asked the police chief to let you visit him.
Hey, Doc, welcome!
Thank heavens for that plane crash!
Tourists weren’t coming here, and I thought I’d have to close the bar and hotel.
Hey, flyboy!
Was the plane that crashed a fighter, or was it —
No comment.
And the cause of the crash —
Oh, I bet that’s a “no comment” too!
-It isn’t safe to go out anymore!
-Shut up!
“Shut up”?
Come on now, these guys are Japan’s allies.
We all gotta get along.
-And now for foreign news... locusts have been destroying crops and forests, spreading rapidly across all the states in India
Assam’s food supply has been devastated
-That’s odd.
-Dr. Nagumo... it’s not that unusual.
Don’t India and Africa often have outbreaks of locusts?
But this isn’t locust season.
This is the first I’ve heard of an outbreak out of season.
What a pleasant surprise!
What brings you here today?
What will you have?
-A brandy.
-A brandy?
Coming right up,
Miss Annabelle.
Charly!
Insects! Insects!
Insects are nothing to be afraid of.
Insects!
Insects!
I can’t stand them!
What’s the matter?
A big man like you, afraid of a bug!
But I’m glad you finally woke up, Charly.
Charly?
Who’s Charly?
Colonel, Charly’s regained consciousness.
-I see.
-But he’s lost his memory.
Lost his memory?
He must have hit his head falling down that cliff.
In that case, it’ll be hard to continue with Operation Broken Arrow.
Do all you can to help him get his memory back.
Yes, sir.
Operation Broken Arrow...
-Annabelle?
-Who are you?
I’m Dr. Nagumo.
I’ve come to prove Joji’s innocence.
Joji’s innocence?
Why won’t you testify in his defense?
Testify?
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
He told me he was with you when it happened.
I do know Joji.
I asked him to collect insects for me.
-You too?
For 20-odd years, these islands didn’t belong to Japan, so they reverted to a natural state.
It’s a rare environment.
You could say it’s an insect paradise.
But people will soon return in large numbers and disturb the natural balance.
What will become of the insects then?
We can already see that people will destroy them.
Are you a biologist too?
No, I just love insects, because they never lie.
I don’t trust people.
-Why not?
You’re Japanese.
Can you have forgotten what happened here two decades ago?
Of course not.
No Japanese person can forget that.
One of the Pacific War’s fiercest battles was fought here.
Human beings are about to repeat the mistakes of that time.
Annabelle... the world is indeed filled with chaos and danger, but we’re not about to wage a final war of annihilation.
Are you that naive?
No, I just have faith in people.
Well, I don’t!
I take it the war took its toll on you.
It left deep scars, scars nobody could ever forget.
Scars nobody should ever forget.
One should fan the flames of such hatred.
Here.
I’m going to have a baby.
-We’re going to have a baby.
-Are you sure?
Yes. Dr. Komuro examined me.
She says I’m three months’ pregnant.
What’s the matter?
It’s your child.
Aren’t you happy?
What’s going on?
I’m going to be a father... and be tried for murder.
What’s going to happen to the baby?
Why didn’t you tell me sooner?
You were away on Kojima for so long.
I wanted to tell you the happy news as soon as possible.
Leave them alone.
Insects have babies too.
That’s why I asked you not to capture them.
That’s the only way we can earn a living!
I’m being sent to Tokyo to be tried for murder.
I’m done for!
Joji, don’t lose hope!
Dr. Nagumo will save us.
I’m sure of it.
Charly’s amnesia isn’t improving.
Colonel Gordon, why do you need him to get his memory back?
Is it to prove Joji’s innocence?
I doubt it.
Joji’s no more than an insect to you.
What’s your point?
You want Charly’s memory back to figure out where your H-bomb landed.
Are you a spy for the Eastern bloc?
Can’t you people see things any other way?
You divide everyone into East and West!
Don’t dodge the question!
I’m just trying to prove a young man’s innocence!
I’m sorry. I take that back.
But how did you know about the H-bomb?
I’d heard that
Operation Broken Arrow is U.S. Air Force code for nuclear weapon-related accidents.
Please keep that confidential.
But what if plutonium from the H-bomb irradiates the surrounding area?
H-bombs are equipped with 40 fail-safes.
No radiation will leak out.
Then why are you so anxious to find that bomb?
I don’t have time to argue with you.
In any event, though our goals differ, we both want Charly to recover his memory.
Don’t worry.
There’s nothing to fear.
We’re ready, sir.
Then let’s start.
Hold Charly down.
Please begin.
Stop!
The insects are coming!
They’re gonna kill me!
Where are the insects?
No! No!
Whyd you go in that cave?
Did something terrible happen?
Charly, try to remember.
It’s dark.
I can’t see a thing.
-Where? In the cave?
And then?
What did you do then?
Light...
There was a light in the darkness.
Insects!
So insects killed those men.
It was a hallucination.
He’s a drug addict.
A drug addict?
He started taking drugs to ease his fear of combat and got addicted.
That’s why I think he’s describing hallucinations.
-Poor guy.
-We’re fighting for freedom!
We’re spilling our blood for freedom and independence!
Can you be certain your war is just?
Nagumo!
I’m going to go see that cave for myself.
I’ll show you the way.
Where’s that bomb?
Where did it land?
Answer me!
Where’s the H-bomb?
If we don’t locate it before the world finds out, we’ll look like fools!
Now tell me!
Insects attacked our plane!
They made us crash.
Damn fool!
You’re hallucinating again!
It’s true!
Insects brought us down!
-Colonel, we found the plane.
-And the bomb?
We’re still searching for it.
That’s strange.
There are no insects anywhere.
So it was a hallucination after all?
I don’t think so.
I’m afraid.
The insects are gone.
This is used for raising poisonous insects.
It’s recent.
Someone’s been here.
Dr. Nagumo!
It’s just a scratch.
Somebody’s been up to something in this cave.
If we figure out what it is, we can prove Joji’s innocence.
Joji! Don’t go yet!
Please wait until Dr. Nagumo returns!
Yukari!
I’m resigned to it now.
-What are you saying?
-That’s enough.
Let me have one last look at the sea.
I may never see such a beautiful sight again.
It’s so beautiful.
I’m going to escape.
I’ll be damned if I just let them kill me.
For your sake and the baby’s,
I’m going to make a run for it.
Stop!
-Stop or I’ll shoot!
-No, don’t!
He’s getting away!
Stop!
No, don’t!
-Why all the commotion?
-The bastard got away.
Joji escaped, the cocky bastard.
Annabelle... help me, please!
It’s Charly.
His memory’s returned.
-Where’s he going?
-That’s none of your concern.
It is. He’s a witness in a murder investigation.
We can’t prove Joji’s innocence without his testimony.
We have questions for him too.
Go on.
Now!
Don’t shoot!
Please don’t shoot me!
There’s a bug.
Annabelle... what do you do with the insects I catch for you?
Joji, just do as I say.
You can’t run away from me now.
If you leave, you’ll be arrested and hanged for murder.
No reason to get so startled.
Oh, Dr. Nagumo...
Charly’s got some guts, killing those MPs like that.
Charly?
Charly’s ill.
I don’t think he has that kind of willpower.
He’s a wild beast.
He’ll turn savage if left unchecked.
You’re the beast for thinking that way.
Lay a finger on her again and you’ll be sorry!
I get the picture.
Help us out here.
Don’t just stand there!
Hold him down!
You’re going to answer my questions.
What kind of plane were you in?
Come on... talk!
Out with it!
A bomber.
And what was that bomber carrying?
Son of a bitch!
Stop it!
Who the hell are you?
Why are you asking these things?
-Shut up!
The U.S. Air Force is frantically searching for that plane.
It must have been carrying a pretty important payload.
Now.., tell us what it was!
Hold it.
That won’t make him talk.
Annabelle, what are you going to do?
-Annabelle —
-Back off!
-Annabelle —
-Just shut up and watch!
When these insects bite... within minutes your cranial nerves are paralyzed... and you go crazy and then die!
-Stop! This is too cruel!
-Get back!
No human being would do this!
That’s right, a human being wouldn’t... so I’m letting the insects do it for me!
Are you out of your mind?
Who did this to me?
Who tattooed these numbers on me?
You know what these numbers mean?
They marked me for death at Auschwitz!
My parents and siblings all died in Nazi concentration camps during the war.
They suffered more than any soldier.
They were tortured to death!
Nazi soldiers made me their plaything, then branded me for death!
Now you tell me to trust in people?
I don’t trust human beings anymore.
Help!
-What was that plane carrying?
-An H-bomb.
An H-bomb?
Please, quickly!
-Where is it?
-I don’t know!
Tell me where the bomb is!
Take the bugs out.
I’ve got more questions.
Not so fast!
Get away from him.
You got what you wanted.
Now it’s time for my little experiment.
Hey, let’s go tell the boss.
The old man already went to bed.
-What do you want this late?
-A shot of whiskey.
Whiskey?
You’re a pain in the butt.
I thought I heard a shortwave radio.
I couldn’t sleep.
I was fooling around a bit.
I exchange messages with a foreign lady friend.
It’s my one hobby.
A fitting hobby for you.
Good night.
What is it?
The door’s unlocked.
“Colonel Gordon: There are
Eastern bloc spies on the island.
They’re after the H-bomb.”
Call the base. Tell them to step up our underwater search efforts.
Get out!
He’s gone totally nuts.
Things will get interesting now!
I don’t know if having the baby is such a good idea now.
You mustn’t try to get rid of it.
But I’m afraid it won’t have a happy life.
You mustn’t lose hope.
Yukari... the baby isn’t just yours.
Joji’s happy about the baby, isn’t he?
Yes, but he’s —
-What are you doing?
-Let me go!
Yukari, run!
Don’t you recognize me?
Please.., drop the gun.
Dr. Nagumo!
Charly’s got a gun!
-What?
He’s dead.
Genocide.., genocide... genocide
Genocide.-- the extermination of mankind.
The insects are singing about destroying humanity.
He’s been bitten.
The bites are festering.
What’s this about?
He depended on me.
I feel I let him down.
It’s unbelievable.
I don’t understand any of this.
Insect eggs.
The insects laid their eggs inside his body.
Their eggs? That’s bizarre.
Unbelievable!
Insects don’t lay eggs in human bodies.
The pilots in the cave looked exactly the same.
They might have been filled with eggs as well.
Their bodies were flown home.
We could have a problem here.
We’d better bury the body quickly.
We found poison in Charly’s blood.
A poison we’ve never seen.
Here’s the analysis.
That’s poison from an insect on this island.
I’ve analyzed it in my lab in Tokyo.
That reminds me:
Charly said something odd.
He said a swarm of insects brought down the bomber, but that’s impossible.
Insects can’t fly at 30,000 feet.
Perhaps... but something abnormal is going on in the insect world.
Why did Charly mention genocide?
Genocide...
The extermination of mankind.
Annabelle!
Are you listening?
Our government wants those poisonous insects at once!
Not yet.
You’re not sending a single one until I’m satisfied.
You’re delusional.
Who do you think is paying for your research?
Don’t forget that the Eastern bloc is paying for all this.
We’re taking them.
I don’t care whether I live in a free society... or a communist one.
What?
I just want to breed vast numbers of insects that drive people mad... and scatter them all over the world.
You’re crazy!
Who’s the crazy one?
Your plans for germ warfare are just as crazy.
Go and see.
Joji!
If he tells Colonel Gordon, our work is ruined. Catch him!
It’s me!
It’s me — Jojil
I’m so glad you’re safe.
I’m sorry I made you worry.
-Are you hurt?
-No.
Those two men from the fishing boat came looking for you.
What’s wrong?
Joji, where have you been hiding all this time?
At Annabelle’s house.
I was afraid of that.
No! No!
We’re going to have a baby, and yet you —
You knew about her?
I was wrong.
Please forgive me.
But I don’t love Annabelle.
I hate her!
-You’re lying.
-I’m not!
She’s not even human.
She’s insane.
She keeps poisonous insects and injects their poison into other insects to breed poisonous new species.
She’s the one who made Charly go mad.
If we don’t stop her, she’s going to kill everyone on the islands.
I have to let Dr. Nagumo know, but they’re watching, so I can’t get near him.
They’re here.
Open up!
Open the door!
-Where’s Joji?
-I don’t know.
-Where’d he go?
You bitch!
If you don’t tell us —
-Tell us!
-Check over there.
My baby will die!
Lying bitch...
Where did Joji go!
Tell me, you bitch!
Quick!
Come here, you!
Go tell the old man.
I’ll take his wife hostage.
Shit! She got away!
Where’s Joji now?
He uses huts around the island when collecting insects.
He’s probably in one of those.
He may get hurt in his haste to get away.
We’ll get Dr. Komuro and set out at dawn.
I need to wrap it.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Annabelle used Charly as her guinea pig.
He was writhing in agony... screaming and on the verge of death.
So she used him as her guinea pig.
He spoke of exterminating mankind.
It was a strange thing to say.
Insect behavior has been abnormal all over the world.
The damage they’re causing is spreading.
Planes everywhere are flying into swarms and crashing.
Genocide... the annihilation of mankind, the screaming of the insects.
I can’t believe it’s all coincidence.
But Charly was a drug addict.
We can’t imagine the hallucinations he might have seen.
Was it all his imagination, or was there something else to it?
I want to find out.
But how?
I’m going to let those insects bite me.
I’ll hallucinate just like Charly did.
Dr. Nagumo!
But you’ll go mad and die like Charly did!
Dr. Nagumo, you mustn’t!
No, I have to try.
If this is injected within ten minutes, it should neutralize the toxin.
Are you sure?
It works on guinea pigs, but I don’t know about human beings.
We don’t have much time.
Joji, get that chair.
Tie my legs tight.
Make sure they won’t come loose.
What time is it?
6:50 p.m.
Joji, put one on my chest.
Quick!
Hurry up!
Give me the antidote at 7:00.
Go on.
I feel dizzy...
I feel like throwing up...
Not yet!
In exactly 10 minutes.
Between my bones.., the insects...
They’re wiggling between my bones.
They’re coursing through me...
The light... it’s coming...
They’re running...
Insects...
The insects are singing.
They’re talking.
“The Earth doesn’t belong to human beings alone.
We don’t care if mankind destroys itself with nuclear weapons, but we refuse to let you take us with you.
Destroy the human race!
Genocide.
Exterminate all humans!”
Dr. Nagumo!
Dr. Nagumo.
It’s hard to believe.
I heard insects’ voices.
Yet we have to believe it.
They’re sensitive creatures.
They fear nuclear destruction more than we do, so they’ve turned against us.
Downing that bomber was their first attack on mankind.
So the three crewmen, including Charly, were the insects’ first victims.
Another one may be dying somewhere.
Weren’t there just three parachutes?
No, I’m pretty sure I saw... four parachutes.
Four?
Wait a minute.
One of them came down really fast, and it glistened in the sun!
Now I get it.
That’s what Colonel Gordon and his men are after.
The H-bomb.
One of those parachutes was the H-bomb.
We should tell
Colonel Gordon right away.
No, we have to stop the insects first.
I’ll take you there.
Doctor, call my lab in Tokyo right away.
Have them make large quantities of antidote.
All right.
Take me with you.
I’m tired of being alone.
Son of a bitch!
Hold it!
Hold it right there.
You’re coming with us.
You’re going to take us to the H-bomb.
-I don’t know where it is.
-Don’t give me that!
Go on!
Wait!
Dr. Nagumo.
I’m right here.
Care for a drink?
No, thanks.
Go ahead.
It’ll be your last drink on Earth.
What?
I hear you did an experiment on yourself.
I want you to do it again, but without the antidote.
Anabelle!
Genocide.
The extermination of man.
That’s what I’ve been waiting for!
-Why?
The human heart holds nothing but hatred.
Our history is a cycle of hate and war.
We know nothing of love.
We only know hatred!
Annabelle!
You don’t know what hell those camps were or how I feel.
Pull out the bed!
-Listen to me!
Don’t move.
I keep my poisonous insects in the basement.
You’ll be my fourth living subject.
Fourth?
It was you who killed those airmen?
That’s right.
I was hatching eggs in that cave.
The two of them showed up, so I used them as guinea pigs.
But that experiment was a failure.
The poison acted too quickly, so their suffering was brief.
I’m also the one who shot at you in the cave.
You’re as toxic as your insects!
Hurry up and move the bed.
Open the trapdoor.
Hurry it up!
What is it?
There it is!
The H-bomb!
They’re getting away!
Stop where you are!
Stop or we’ll shoot!
Too late!
The insects are gone.
Still don’t believe it?
I don’t care about insects.
I just don’t want those spies to find the bomb.
This is all happening because both sides persist in your senseless arms race.
Don’t you understand?
-Shut up!
Burn this house down!
Everyone out now!
I’m afraid.
The insects are killing the monkeys.
Oh, no!
Don’t look.
What’s going to happen to us?
We haven’t done anything wrong, but we’ll be killed anyway.
Maybe I deserve to die, but you —
-Don’t talk like that.
-Yukari...
I’ve caused you nothing but worry.
I’ve done nothing for you.
Please forgive me.
If I were reborn into this world,
I’d marry you all over again.
I know you’re a spy, you bastard!
You’re a disgrace to Japan!
Where are Joji and Yukari?
Tell me!
Okay, I’ll tell you. Please stop.
They’re one island over, near where the H-bomb came down.
Is that the truth?
Yes, Matsunaga contacted me by radio.
Matsunaga, Yokol, come In.
Answer me!
Matsunaga, Yokol, come ini
/f you can hear me, respond!
Insects.
Over there too.
And there too!
Are you all right?
We have to do something!
Don’t try to stop me!
Matsunaga, Yokoi, answer me!
Answer me!
Joji, Yukari!
Answer if you can hear me.
Dr. Nagumo, have you located them?
There’s no answer.
Did you contact Tokyo?
Yes, but nobody would believe me.
Humanity’s facing extinction, and now this!
We’ll leave for the island at dawn.
Joji, Yukari! Answer me!
Get inside here.
What about you?
I have to protect you.
I’ll fight them off to the end.
You have to survive no matter what!
Joji, I want to die with you!
What are you saying?
You’re carrying our baby!
You wanna kill the baby too?
Have our baby, all right?
Get in!
Once it’s safe, get off the island as fast as you can.
Hurry!
Watch out!
Stay down there!
Yukari, you must survive!
Live on without me!
This is the aftermath.
There’s a hut over there.
How did this happen?
How?
Yukari!
Yukari, hang on!
You survived.
Where’s Joji?
Don’t look.
It’s better not to look.
Don’t look.
Dr. Nagumol
Come with me.
What is it, Colonel Gordon?
Look at that.
-Is that a tornado?
-No, insects.
Insects?
You still don’t believe me?
It’s the revenge of the insects.
I understand now.
Nagumo, we need you.
Come with us to the base.
-I don’t have time.
I have to evacuate the islanders and destroy the insects.
Stop!
You’re coming with us!
What are you doing?
Nagumo, we need you.
Get in the jeep.
-Dr. Nagumo.
-I’ll be back.
-Evacuate the island right away.
-WhatlI happen to us?
Can we destroy the insects?
I don’t know, but we have to try.
Hurry up!
I promise I’ll be back.
Yukari.
Yukari, where are you going?
To have my baby somewhere without any insects!
To have Joji’s baby!
It’s too dangerous!
In your condition you’ll die out at sea!
Nagumo.-- have a seat.
-I don’t want to kill you.
-What do you mean?
You’re an expert on insects, aren’t you?
You want the antidote.
You catch on quick.
That’s right.
You aren’t the only ones who need it.
The islanders do too!
Not anymore.
Why not?
They’ll be dead in a few minutes.
The H-bomb’s about to detonate.
When we send a signal on the detonator’s frequency, it’ll explode.
It’s our last resort to keep it out of enemy hands.
That’s crazy!
Thatli kill everyone on the islands!
It’ll rain radiation on the rest of Japan.
What will the Japanese do?
Certain sacrifices must be made in war.
Detonating it will wipe out the insects before they can spread and keep the bomb out of enemy hands.
It’ll also protect our military secrets.
It’s a small sacrifice to save the whole world!
Superpower arrogance is what it is!
All ready, sir.
-No, don’t!
-Don’t interfere!
Try that again and I’ll shoot.
-Don’t do it!
-Back off!
Hold it!
What the hell are you doing?
I refuse to be responsible for destroying the world.
I’m not going to trigger a nuclear war!
Colonel, watch out!
Insects!
We’ve flown into a swarm!
THE END
An evil old house, the kind some people call haunted...
is like an undiscovered country waiting to be explored.
Hill House had stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more.
Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House.
Whatever walked there walked alone.
Scandal, murder, insanity, suicide.
The history of Hill House was ideal.
It had everything I wanted.
It was built 90-odd, very odd years ago...
by a man named Hugh Crain as a home for his wife and daughter...
in the most remote part of New England he could find.
It was an evil house from the beginning.
A house that was born bad.
Hugh Crain's young wife...
died seconds before she was to set eyes on the house.
She was killed when, for no apparent reason...
the horses bolted, crashing her carriage against a big tree.
Mrs. Crain was carried...
lifeless is the word, I think...
into the home her husband had built for her.
Hugh Crain was left an embittered man...
with a small daughter, Abigail, to bring up.
Fortunately, for me, that is...
Hugh Crain did not leave Hill House.
He married again.
The second Mrs. Crain's death was even more interesting...
than her predecessor's.
I've been unable to find out how or why she fell...
although I have my suspicions.
Hugh Crain left Abigail with a nurse and went to England...
where he died in a drowning accident.
Marvelous!
I mean, the way the history of Hill House follows a classic pattern.
For some reason...
Abigail kept that same nursery room in Hill House where she grew up...
and grew old.
In later years, she became a bedridden invalid.
She took a girl from the village to live with her as a paid companion.
It's with this young companion...
the evil reputation of Hill House really begins.
The story goes that the old lady died calling for help...
in the nursery upstairs...
while the companion fooled around with a farm hand on the verandah.
The companion inherited Hill House and occupied it for many years.
The local people believe that, one way or another...
she had murdered her benefactor.
She lived a life of complete solitude in the empty house...
though some say that the house was not empty...
and never has been since the night old Miss Abby died.
They say that whatever there was and still is in the house...
eventually drove the companion mad.
We do know she hanged herself.
After her death...
the house passed legally into the hands of a distant relative in Boston...
an old lady, Mrs. Sannerson, who I very much wanted to see.
All my life I've been looking for an honestly haunted house.
In the interests of psychic research, you must let me have it for a few weeks.
No one who rented Hill House ever stayed for more than a few days.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
I don't believe it.
Dr. Markway is a trained anthropologist... a respected member of a university faculty.
We should welcome such a man to investigate Hill House.
Perhaps.
As an old woman due shortly to enter the next world...
I'd like to know if there is one.
I'm sure his report will give Hill House a clean bill of health.
How will you go about conducting your investigations, Dr. Markway?
I shall occupy the house with a group of carefully selected assistants...
- Assistants?
- My dear Mrs. Sannerson...
I am a scientist conducting an unusual experiment.
A haunted house. Everyone laughs.
So I must have specially qualified help... to take notes and document any evidence of the supernatural I may find.
- Who are these assistants?
- I haven't made my final choice yet... but they're from a list of names
I've been assembling over the years.
- We don't want any publicity seekers.
- Of course not.
These people have only been selected after painstaking research.
They've all been involved before, one way or another, with the abnormal.
I don't like the sound of that.
- Are any of the people women?
- Some.
- Are you a married man?
- Yes.
Then your wife will be accompanying you.
I'm afraid not.
My wife disapproves of my experiments with the supernatural.
She wants no part of Hill House.
To make sure that everything is as it should be... suppose your nephew goes along with Dr. Markway?
Luke?
Our young Lochinvar from out of the Midwest.
I haven't much confidence in that branch of the family.
In this case, I think you can.
Luke expects to inherit Hill House... and he'll make sure that his property is well taken care of.
His property?
Still, it might be rather good at that.
Luke hopes one day to live off Hill House.
But he never dreamed to find himself living in it.
Harper, give Dr. Markway his lease.
Thank you, Mrs. Sannerson.
A word of warning:
Don't play gin with Luke.
He's a cardsharp.
Good. That indicates a strong instinct for self-preservation.
Exactly what do you and your assistants expect to find at Hill House?
Maybe only a few loose floorboards, and maybe...
I only say maybe... the key to another world.
You've just got to let me have the car.
There's no other way of getting there, and I'm expected.
- Calm down.
- I've even bought some new clothes.
Please, Bud.
Carrie drives the car all the time and I never even take it out of the garage.
- Mother...
- Mother what?
Nothing.
Auntie Nell is blinking.
Quiet, Dora.
Let's talk this over without anybody getting emotional or nervous.
Why shouldn't I be nervous?
My first chance for a vacation in my life and you won't let me take it.
There's a good reason Mother was afraid for you to go anywhere... and it still applies.
We're not going to dig up the family skeleton again, are we?
I think you should have a vacation, Nell.
Nobody knows better than me what you went through during your mother's illness.
Dirty laundry, the smell of that sickroom...
Talk about mean old ladies!
Let the dead rest in peace.
It's half my car.
I helped pay for it and I mean to take it.
We don't know where you're going.
You haven't seen fit to tell us anything, have you?
No, you may not have the car.
What beats me is why you're playing this thing so cozy... like this was a jailbreak.
In any case, I'm sure I'm doing what Mother would have thought best.
Although I don't suppose poor Mother's wishes mean much to you.
Get out. Get out, both of you.
Now just a minute, young lady.
You happen to be in my living room.
I happen to be in my bedroom, and I pay a good part of your rent for it.
Now get out before I show you what my nerves can really do!
Besides, how do I know you'll bring back my car in good condition?
Come on.
I want my car. I mean to take it.
- Which?
- The Fredericks' car.
- You ain't Mrs. Fredericks.
- It's half mine.
- Who are you?
- Her sister, Miss Lance.
Look, here's my driver's license... here's my library card... and here's a blood donor card.
All the same address as my sister's.
I live with her.
- Front row, left of the far pillar.
- Thank you.
"Very happy that you'll be joining us in Hill House.
"Take US 50 from Boston...
"and watch for the turnoff onto Route 238."
Route 238.
At last I am going someplace where I'm expected...
and where I'm being given shelter.
And I shall never have to come back.
I hope...
This is what I've been waiting for all my life.
I'm going. I'm really going.
I've finally taken a step.
By now they know the car is gone...
but they don't know where.
They would never have suspected it of me.
I would never have suspected it of myself.
I'm a new person.
Someday...
Someday I'll have an apartment of my own...
in a house with a pair of stone lions guarding the gate.
I might just stop anywhere and never leave again.
Or I might drive on and on...
until the wheels of the car are worn to nothing...
and I've come to the end of the world.
I wonder if all homeless people feel that way.
I wonder what Dr. Markway is like.
I wonder who else will be there.
I wonder what Hill House is like.
- What do you want?
- I want to come in, please.
- Please unlock the gates.
- Who says?
I'm supposed to come in. I'm expected.
- Who by?
- Dr. Markway.
- You better come back later.
- Please.
I'm one of Dr. Markway's guests.
He's expecting me in the house.
Please listen to me.
He can't rightly be expecting you... seeing as you're the only one who's come so far.
Do you mean that there's no one in the house?
No one you'd want to see.
- What did you say your name was?
- Eleanor Lance... and I am expected in Hill House.
- Unlock those gates at once.
- All right.
Suppose you know what you're asking for coming here.
Suppose they told you, back in the city.
You seem to be the one who's afraid.
You'll be sorry I ever opened the gate.
Out of the way, please.
You've held me up long enough.
- Are you Dudley, the caretaker?
- I'm Dudley, the caretaker.
I shall report you.
Think they can find anyone else to stay here?
Think we can't have things the way we want, me and the wife... as long as we stay around here, see to the house... for all you city people think you know everything?
It's staring at me.
Vile.
Get away from here. Get away at once.
It's my chance.
I'm being given a last chance.
I could turn my car around and go away from here...
and no one would blame me.
Anyone has a right to run away.
But you are running away, Eleanor...
and there's nowhere else to go.
It's waiting for me.
Evil, patient...
waiting.
Mrs. Dudley?
I'm Eleanor Lance. I'm expected.
Can you take me to my room?
I gather I'm the first one here,
Mrs. Dudley.
You did say you were Mrs. Dudley?
I met your...
Talk about being scared of your own shadow.
Pull yourself together.
Here.
This is your room.
How nice.
I can't keep the rooms the way I'd like... but there's no one else they could get that would help me.
How very nice.
I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at 6:00.
I clear up in the morning.
I have breakfast for you at 9:00.
I don't wait on people.
I don't stay after I set out the dinner.
Not after it begins to get dark.
I leave before the dark comes.
- Your husband?
- We live over in town, miles away.
So there won't be anyone around if you need help.
I understand.
We couldn't hear you... in the night.
- Do you have any idea when...
- No one could.
No one lives any nearer than town.
No one will come any nearer than that...
I know.
...in the night, in the dark.
I'm like a small creature swallowed whole by a monster...
and the monster feels my tiny movements inside.
Now, Eleanor Lance, you just stop it.
There's no one else they could get.
I set dinner on the...
Thank heavens somebody's here.
My name's Eleanor Lance.
I'm so glad you're here.
I'm Theodora. Just Theodora.
What about this crazy house?
I'm right next door.
We have a connecting bath.
This used to be the embalming room, I bet.
It was terrible being here alone.
I set dinner on the sideboard at 6:00...
Where's Markway?
I thought he'd be here first.
Serve yourselves.
I clear up in the morning.
- Have you known Dr. Markway long?
- Breakfast is at 9:00.
- I've never met him.
- I don't stay after 6:00, when it gets dark.
Our only contact is our correspondence about the "experiment."
I leave before the dark comes.
So there won't be anyone around if you need help.
No one can hear you if you scream in the night.
Isn't that so, Mrs. Dudley?
No one lives any nearer than town.
No one will come any nearer than that... in the night... in the dark.
- You're frightened, Nell.
- No more.
Just when I thought I was all alone.
But how did you know my nickname is Nell?
That is the affectionate term for Eleanor, isn't it?
Yes, I suppose it is.
What a nice way of putting it.
The affectionate term for Theodora is Theo.
We're going to be great friends, Theo.
Like sisters?
There's no need to hang around our rooms.
- Let's go exploring.
- I'd like to.
Why don't you put on one of your new things? Something that'll stand out.
I think it's a good idea around here to always remain strictly visible.
Be ready in a jiffy.
How did you know I brought new clothes?
You wear your thoughts on your sleeve.
Anyway, that's better than my heart.
How did I get into this? Why am I here?
What nightmares are waiting?
Damn it! I still say one of these doors should lead to the main hall.
Any lights near you, Nell?
It helps if you make a game of it.
Pretend this is hide-and-seek.
But we're still lost.
Yes.
That passageway.
We haven't tried that one yet.
What's the matter?
There's something with us.
I don't see anything.
- Can't you feel it?
- No.
I feel a chill.
- It's moving.
- It's just the air rushing past our ears.
Then who?
What?
The house, it's alive.
She didn't hear that.
Nobody heard it but me.
It wants you, Nell.
The house is calling you.
I've waited such a long time.
Is this what I came so far to find?
Don't let me go! Theo, stay with me!
You won't believe this, but five minutes ago I left this door open... so you could find your way.
It closed by itself.
Welcome to Hill House. I'm Dr. Markway.
Thank goodness.
I thought you might be a ghost.
- How do you know I'm not?
- Don't be ghoulish.
You mustn't confuse ghoulish and ghostly.
The word "ghoulish" is used to describe a feeling of horror... often accompanied by intense cold.
It has nothing to do with ghosts.
Ghosts are visible.
- Enough of that. Get us out of here fast.
- What's the matter?
Let's just say we're scared of the dark.
I, too, go in mortal terror of the dark.
- I'm Theodora.
- You must be Eleanor.
I'm unsure at the moment.
If it turns out you're not,
I'll be disappointed.
All right.
It's Theo who's wearing velvet, so I must be Eleanor in tweed.
Good.
Follow me through the uncharted waste of Hill House.
Dinner's waiting.
- Do you like it?
- Lovely. What do you call this?
The Purple Parlor.
We're going to use this as the operating room.
I mean the center of operations.
- It's not very cheerful.
- I don't know.
There's nothing more cozy than an old gargoyle... except maybe a whipping post or two.
This house does have its little oddities.
The man who built it was a misfit... who hated people and their conventional ideas.
He built his house to suit his mind.
For instance, all the doors are hung slightly off-center.
Probably explains why they keep swinging shut by themselves.
Watch.
Now watch this.
What did I tell you?
Anyway, all the angles are slightly off.
There isn't a square corner in the place.
No wonder it's impossible to find your way around.
Add up all these wrong angles... and you get one big distortion in the house as a whole.
Clever, Eleanor. You catch on fast.
I'm hungry.
Let's go.
Sorry. In the psychic world we're apt to forget... that food is still the main concern of poor old homo sapiens.
You see? Closed by itself.
To the right, ladies.
Now, which door?
- That one.
- Wrong.
I've studied a map, it's this one.
- This proves it, one of you is a witch.
- A broom closet.
If you can't find your way around, how will we ever?
All these doors, it makes me think of the lady and the tiger.
Let's see if there's a tiger behind this one.
That's funny.
- No tiger?
- Listen.
What's wrong? Too much vermouth?
Nothing that serious... and, please, no cracks about my passion for spirits.
If you two are the ghostly inhabitants of Hill House...
I must confess I'm glad I came.
It has taken 60 million years... to develop the carnivorous biped you see before you.
Luke Sannerson.
Let's see what kind of martinis it makes.
They should be pretty good.
I majored in them at college.
Are we to expect any more carnivorous bipeds?
Originally, there were six committed to the experiment... but one by one the others dropped out.
I suppose they were frightened by the various unsavory stories about the house.
You're the only ones left.
What stories?
You didn't investigate before you came here?
So much the better.
You should be innocent and receptive.
- So let's drink to our success.
- Success?
And just how do you reckon success in a junket like this?
I'd like to drink... to just us, good companions.
Excellent.
To my new companion.
Except I don't drink.
- I think I'll have some more salmon.
- Palissy.
- Yeah? How much is it worth?
- Plenty.
Haven't seen Palissy outside of a museum.
I'll take a pair of Kastle skis for them any day of the week.
I wonder how much I'll get for this New England fossil.
Don't let Mrs. Dudley hear you saying that.
At the moment she's giving us the best.
I'm a simple fellow myself, easily satisfied by the best of everything.
Including, I hope, some startling events to come.
Exactly what do you expect to happen, Dr. Markway?
Yes, what is the matter with Hill House?
What's going to happen?
Why are we here?
Like so many people through the ages,
I've been intrigued by the supernatural... or rather the possibility of the supernatural.
I'm here in hopes of proving its existence.
You're here to keep track and take notes for an authenticated record.
- Okay. But why us?
- It's no accident.
You're what's left of a select company chosen with great care.
I combed the records of psychic societies... the back numbers of newspapers, reports of parapsychologists... hoping to find people who've been touched in some way by the supernatural.
It's my belief that the very presence of people like yourselves in this house... will help to stimulate the strange forces at work here.
Charming thought, to be used as live bait.
I'm here because
I'm a wolf in ghost's clothing.
I'm not really running a psychic beauty contest.
You're here, Theo... because of your remarkable powers of extrasensory perception.
ESP? Don't believe in it.
Theo's a champ.
Her name shines in the annals of Duke University Psychic Lab... where she identified 19 out of 20 cards... held up out of sight and hearing.
But I've never had anything to do with the supernatural.
Yes, you have, Eleanor.
Your poltergeist experience.
What's a poltergeist?
- A playful ghost, isn't that right, Nell?
- I wouldn't know.
According to the records of the International Psychic Society... showers of stones fell on your house for three days when you were 10 years old.
That's ridiculous.
It was witnessed by your family... the neighbors, sightseers and the police.
In fact, it's the only case ever officially recorded by the police.
It never happened.
Perhaps not, if you say so.
I only mention it because that's the reason I wanted you in Hill House.
Doc, level with us.
I mean, you're a college prof.
A man with a PhD.
You can't really believe there's such a thing as a haunted house.
I wish you'd stop referring to this desirable property as haunted.
There's that word "haunted" again.
Makes me expect to find a disembodied hand in the sauce.
Nobody knows even why some houses are called haunted.
What would you call this place?
Fun-o-rama?
Diseased, sick, crazy if you like.
A deranged house isn't a bad way of putting it.
Your aunt thinks that maybe Hill House was born bad.
Such houses are described in the Bible as leprous.
Or before that, in Homer's phrase for the underworld:
A house of Hades.
Come off it, Doc.
Really, the local mayor makes more sense to me.
He says the disturbances are caused by subterranean waters... electric currents, atmospheric pressure, sunspots, earth tremors, et cetera.
Sure, people always want to put an easy label on things... even if it's meaningless.
"The trouble with Hill House is sunspots."
There's an explanation you don't have to think twice about.
And it has a scientific ring.
That was the neighbors.
They threw the rocks.
Mother says they were against us because she wouldn't mix with them.
Mother says...
Oh, dear.
That's all right, Eleanor.
- Go on. What does your mother say?
- Nothing.
I must be more tired than I thought.
My mother died two months ago.
You weren't sorry when it happened... were you?
No, she wasn't very happy.
Then I won't say I'm sorry now.
If I'd known,
I'd never have asked you to come here.
But I'm grateful you did. I had to get away.
- Perhaps you should...
- Please, let's talk about something else.
Oh, dear.
Doc, see that? Now what about that?
Does salt work against the supernatural?
The Montusi bushmen thought so, but they're extinct.
You see, you haven't a ghost of a chance.
I have a place in this room.
These people are my friends.
I'm one of them. I belong.
Gin!
- That's the fifth time, five times in a row.
- $12, please.
- I hope your skirt isn't stained.
- That's all right.
But the upholstery on the couch.
I've cleanser upstairs.
- Do you think I'm a sucker?
- Pay up. Cash on the line.
Over my dead body.
You knew every card I had in my hand.
- There's a name for that.
- If you mean cheating, I don't have to.
Okay, Miss ESP, go dream yourself up the $12.
Pay up, you welsher!
I won fair and I want my money.
- What was it?
- I had a feeling.
- I'm sure it was just my imagination.
- A feeling you were being watched?
Yes, I did.
The house.
It watches every move we make.
- That's your imagination.
- Don't be so cocksure of everything.
A closed mind is the worst defense against the supernatural.
You think you're too civilized to need to protect yourself against evil spirits.
But even prehistoric man had a dozen practical methods of warding them off.
Some of your theories strike me as prehistoric.
Besides, they downgrade property values.
I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen.
Yet it does happen.
Ghosts make the papers along with celebrities every day of the week.
If it happens to you... you're liable to have that shut door in your mind... ripped right off its hinges.
Look, Doc, we're buddies, but don't try to convert me.
I'm trying to prepare you.
There's something going on in this house or I wouldn't be here.
What?
Don't ask me to give a name to something which hasn't got a name.
I don't know.
Tomorrow we'll see all the place.
Now let's go to bed.
Unless anyone wants to clear out now... and not have anything more to do with Hill House.
I hope to have plenty to do with it someday, moneywise.
We couldn't leave now even if we wanted to.
- You mean I'm holding you prisoner?
- I mean Dudley keeps the gates locked.
We could always break out.
I have a key to the gate anytime you want it.
- I wouldn't dream of leaving.
- Thank you.
Adventurers all.
But you mustn't expect every night to be Halloween.
Psychic phenomena are subject to certain laws.
And just what are these laws?
You won't know until you break them.
At the end of each day, you have to fill out these forms I've had mimeographed.
Very scientific, aren't we?
The really scientific phase won't start for a while yet.
First of all, we have to get orientated.
What's this? Looks like "psy-kookiness."
Nothing like that wrong with me.
Psychokinesis is just the technical form... for what you'd call objects moving by themselves.
Actually, they don't... but are moved by a force from somewhere which we call psychokinesis.
I see.
About this ghost
I can expect in my room tonight... tell me, is it male or female?
Good night, ladies, Doc.
I just thought of something.
Nobody locked the front door.
Won't make any difference.
I see.
- Good night, Dr. Markway.
- John.
Good night, Theo.
Get a good rest, Eleanor. Sleep well.
I'll turn the lights off below, in case you wonder who did it.
If you feel in the least bit nervous, just run right into my room.
Thanks. Good night.
I'll come in for a second.
You've been thinking of changing your hair. I know just the style for you.
Why, yes. I was. But I'm awfully tired.
- Thanks anyhow.
- Okay. We have a date for breakfast.
Good night, Theo.
Funny. Everything's so ugly and yet so comfortable.
Like drowning, I guess.
Now I can think about them. I'm all alone.
Alone.
He won't know I locked it.
Against what, Eleanor?
All right, Mother.
Just a minute. I'm coming.
What, Theo?
Nell, in here!
I'm here. What is it?
I thought it was you pounding.
It was. I mean, I did.
But now it's down near the other end of the hall.
It's not at all like Mother knocking on the wall.
It's only a noise, and the room is terribly cold.
Terribly, terribly cold.
It must be Luke and Dr. Markway.
Why should they be knocking on the walls?
Something is. Anyway, it's only a noise.
Earth tremors?
Maybe it'll go down on the other side of the hall.
- No!
- Go away!
Now I've done it.
It was looking for the room with someone inside.
You big baby.
Whatever it is, it's just a noise.
- I'm cold.
- So am I.
- Where's Luke? Where's Markway?
- I don't know.
- Warmer now?
- No.
In a minute
I'll go out in the hall and call them.
Are you all right?
Oh, God, Nell!
It's against the top of the door!
It's found us.
Now I know why people scream, because I think I'm going to.
Is the door locked?
You can't get in!
It's over.
- How do you know?
- Can't you feel it?
Aren't you warm again?
That terrible cold has gone.
Why, yes.
Intense cold is one of the symptoms of shock. My mother...
Intense shock is one of the symptoms I've got.
Where have you two been?
What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Did anything happen?
Nothing in particular... just something knocked on the door with a cannonball... then tried to get in and eat us.
I'm with Nell.
Miss ESP and Bridey Murphy, some combination.
- There isn't a scratch on the wood.
- Or anywhere else.
How nice, it didn't mar the woodwork.
Where were you, Dr. Markway?
Chasing a dog.
At least, we assumed it was a dog.
We followed it outside.
You mean it was inside?
I thought I heard something run past my room.
I woke Luke. We went looking for it all over the house... and finally out in the garden.
But let's face it, girls, we didn't get very far from the house.
Then you must've heard that ungodly noise.
No, there wasn't a sound from the house.
At least, nothing audible to us.
- We'd better take precautions.
- Against what?
When Luke and I are decoyed outside... and you two are bottled up inside... wouldn't you say that something, somehow, is trying to separate us?
Good morning, Dr. Markway.
'Morning, and please call me John.
- This curious life seems to agree with you.
- Thank you.
- Tea or coffee?
- Tea, please.
How is it you look so pretty after last night?
That was last night.
There may have been a little noise.
One has to expect that in these old houses.
I give up. I was sure you'd be packed and on your way.
Not likely.
This is my first vacation in years and I'm going to enjoy it.
That's the point. You need a real vacation.
This isn't the place for one.
I mean to stay. Period.
Unless, of course, you want to get rid of me.
No, you mustn't think that.
Till last night you were just a name on my list.
I scarcely know Eleanor Lance.
- She's horrible.
- No, you mustn't make fun of me.
You're sweet and pleasant and everyone likes you very much.
I want to know more about you.
I dislike lobster, crack my knuckles when I'm nervous... save buttons, and sleep on my left side.
Why on the left side?
I read someplace it wears the heart out quicker.
That's a depressing thought.
For the past 11 years I've been walled up alive on a desert island.
I thought you might be hiding some dark romantic secret in your past.
Romantic?
I've spent all my adult life taking care of my invalid mother... until she died.
No, it wasn't romantic.
Now that you're free at last, you shouldn't be wasting your time in Hill House.
- It's a mistake.
- But it isn't, don't you see?
The only thing that kept me going... was that someday
I knew something would happen.
Something truly extraordinary, like Hill House.
Yes, it's extraordinary.
What'll you do when you get back?
Do you have a job?
No job, nothing.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
You wouldn't send me back, would you?
That depends on what happens.
We may all have to go back.
But I won't give up easily.
How did you get so interested in the supernatural?
I didn't want to become what my father called a practical man.
I come from one of those respectable English families... that dragged all the Victorian virtues into the 20th century.
In a Gladstone bag, of course.
Everything had to be practical and conventional.
So my first reaction as a kid... was to choose something useless and unconventional. Like ghosts.
But you're an anthropologist now.
When I refused to read law at Oxford as my father had... there was a terrific row.
I took off for America, without my Gladstone bag... and worked my way through college.
I decided on anthropology because it seemed... to be a short step from the study of dead souls... to the study of dead men and dead civilizations.
I'm not very practical, either.
But it didn't occur to me till I was hooked... that my combined knowledge of anthropology and psychic phenomena... had led me on to something very practical.
You see, if ghosts, which are pure spirit, come from man... then perhaps it's possible some day to have individuals... whose spiritual caliber far surpasses anything humanity has yet known.
Human nature could certainly stand some improvements.
However, my idea remains pure theory... until somebody proves definitely the supernatural exists.
Anyway, that's enough about me.
Now tell me about last night.
Thank you.
I've been trying to remember.
I can remember knowing I was frightened... but I can't remember actually being frightened, or how I felt.
I think it's because it was so unreal.
Still could be subterranean waters, you know.
I hope not.
That wouldn't be nearly so exciting.
Not good, this feeling of excitement.
It's the first sign you've fallen under the spell of the house.
Maybe it isn't just the house.
Then what else?
Let's blame it on sunspots.
Well, it wasn't sunspots last night.
If anyone gets hurt, it's going to be your fault, Markway.
No ghost in all the long history of ghosts ever hurt anyone physically.
We weren't in any actual danger at all, isn't that right, John?
No, not entirely.
Fear alone can do the damage to the victim.
Prehistoric man, for instance, could die of fright during an eclipse.
- Poor sap.
- You mean poor homo sapiens.
A modern man can react with the same unreasoning terror... to a supernatural event.
Especially if he doesn't believe that the supernatural exists.
I've always been more afraid of being left alone or left out... than of things that go bump in the night.
What are you afraid of, Theo?
Of knowing what I really want.
- Good morning, fellow earthlings.
- Luke, what are you afraid of?
What I just saw in the hall.
- Is there something?
- You mean you haven't seen it?
The show's just getting good. Come on.
Right here.
It's writing?
Writing.
Chalk.
Or something like chalk.
- Can you read it?
- No.
What?
No.
Wipe it off, please. It's crazy.
Crazy is the word for it, all right.
- Get something and wipe it off, Luke.
- But it's crazy. Why?
Why all the fuss?
It spelled her name right, didn't it?
- Those letters spelled out my name.
- Take it easy.
It's my name!
It belongs to me and something is using it.
Writing it and calling me with my own name!
- Just because your name...
- That's it!
It knows my name, doesn't it?
- It knows my name!
- Simmer down, Nell.
It could have said any of us.
It knows all our names.
Did you write it? Please tell me.
I won't be angry or anything.
I just want to know so that...
Maybe it was only for a joke to frighten me.
You know none of us wrote it, baby.
- She's lying, I could swear she did it.
- Easy.
I clear breakfast at 10:00.
- Why should I write your name?
- I set lunch at 1:00.
Because I didn't wait to have breakfast with you.
- You're way out.
- You don't know Theo as I'm beginning to.
- I clear up at 10:00.
- Mrs. Dudley, please!
- No one blames you for being upset.
- It's 10:00.
Why me? Why should I be the one chosen?
Maybe something in the house finds you a kindred spirit.
Maybe it thinks you have more understanding and sympathy than we do.
Maybe you wrote it yourself.
Sure, I'm just the kind to want to see my name...
- scribbled all over this foul house!
- It's one way to attract attention, isn't it?
You think I like the idea
I'm the center of attention?
Why are you all done up in that new hairstyle?
- You were the one who suggested...
- That's enough.
How dare you?
Can't you see Theo's just trying to get a rise out of you... so you won't be frightened anymore?
I'm sorry.
Take Eleanor to her room.
We'll postpone the tour of the house.
Okay, but don't forget.
I don't want to spend another night... wondering what's over my head or underneath me.
You wouldn't leave me behind, would you?
No one will leave you behind.
Holy cow! Mount Rushmore!
- It's not there. I don't believe it's there.
- How?
I thought you'd get a kick out of it.
It's supposed to be St. Francis curing the lepers.
I'd say it's a family portrait.
A composite.
The tall, draped, masculine type... that's old Hugh Crain... pointing out all the great treasures in this creepy house he built.
The dame on the end down there and this one must be his two wives.
His daughter, Abigail.
- Now the dog...
- The dog you were chasing last night.
Yeah, very good.
Now that one, she's got to be the companion.
The one who's supposed to have murdered Abigail.
No, that was much later.
When Abigail was an old lady.
I wonder how this statue got here.
It wasn't on the original inventory.
Maybe I'll break it up and sell it for tombstones.
The companion reminds me of you, Nell.
Oh, no!
She does at that.
A natural beauty, I'd call her.
What does he think of me, really?
Am I being a fool?
Don't let me know too surely what he thinks of me.
This could be a family portrait of us.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- You're the companion.
I'm Abigail, grown up.
And Markway could be old Hugh.
- Where do I fit in?
- The dog.
When are you going to show me your ESP?
Keep your hands to yourself.
What's going on?
More than meets the eye.
You know, this wouldn't be such a bad room without the statue.
Ideal for the zombies' annual ball.
Why don't you dance with Hugh?
I believe he has his eye on you.
- That's not funny.
- Don't be chicken.
- Leave her alone.
- I bet she doesn't know how to dance.
I do, too.
Hugh Crain, will you dance with me?
I believe he's going to accept.
- He moved.
- Of course.
Haven't you noticed how nothing in the house moves till you look away... and then you just catch something out of the corner of your eye?
She stepped on my toe.
Let's go out this way before somebody gets hurt.
Come over here, I want to show you something really unique.
A library complete with ivory tower.
I can't go in there.
- My mother...
- Yes?
That smell...
- It's just stale air, Eleanor.
- No, that other smell... Awful.
Smells sweet to me, honey.
At 25 cents a book,
I should do all right with this room.
I don't think I'll do much reading while I'm here.
- Not if the books smell like the library.
- I didn't notice it.
No, that's good, Eleanor.
It's just what we're after.
Try and remember your reaction and describe it exactly...
- when you write your notes tonight.
- That's what I'm here for.
Only, do you mind if I skip the library for now?
No, do just what you want.
We'll only be a minute.
- You're sure you're all right?
- Yes.
I want to show you something really interesting.
You remember that companion, the one that Abigail had... when she was an old lady?
See that little balcony... clear up at the top there, right up there in the shadows?
That's where the companion hanged herself.
- It would have been easier to jump.
- Without a parachute?
They say she tied the rope on to the railing and then...
Thanks, we get it.
I just had a great idea.
You know what I'll do with this room?
After I inherit the house, of course.
I'll turn it into a nightclub.
Tear out these bookshelves and put a band in there.
Now comes the best part.
A line of beautiful chorus girls dancing down these stairs.
Can't you see it?
- Are you all right?
- I think so.
- Quick thinking.
- Instinct.
My strong instinct for self-preservation.
And it's telling me right now loud and clear to get the hell out of here.
Vile. Hideous.
I wonder what it would be like looking down from there.
That's where she did it.
From that window.
Climbing out through the bars...
hanging on for an instant, hanging on...
Eleanor, you'll fall!
Didn't you hear me calling?
This house, you have to watch it every minute.
I didn't realize you were so nervous.
I think I should send you home.
- No, please, I can't go home.
- It's no reflection on you.
An atmosphere like this might break anyone down.
But I'm not breaking down.
I did hear noises last night.
Something was trying to get into the room.
You realize that if even one event is proved to be a hallucination... then this whole experiment will be questioned.
I'm not crazy, you know.
After all, Theo was there, too.
Is it my fault it just didn't make sense?
We'll let it go for now.
- Maybe I'm just being selfish.
- Selfish?
Keeping you here for the sake of the experiment.
Of course, for the sake of the experiment.
You do seem to be the main attraction... for whatever's in the house.
- But I'll send you back the minute...
- No, please. I'm all right. Really I am.
Well, don't you two look cozy.
She was halfway off the verandah when I caught her.
I was leaning back to see the top of the tower.
- I got dizzy.
- Dizzy like a fox?
Poor Nell.
You look like death. Let's go inside.
I think you'd better move in with Eleanor.
- You're the doctor.
- But that's my room, my very own room.
I wouldn't want to risk either of you spending another night alone.
Don't get all hung up, Nell.
We'll have fun. Like sisters.
- It tickles.
- Of course.
Your toes are tickled pink.
I knew my shade would suit you perfectly.
Have another drink.
It will keep the chill out.
Just a teensy one. To keep the chill out.
- I don't really like whisky.
- This is brandy.
By the time I'm through with you, Nell, you'll be a different person.
It's wicked.
I mean, on my foot.
You've got foolishness and wickedness mixed up.
Maybe.
Haven't had much chance to learn the difference.
Know something?
Even when I'd play solitaire in my room... she'd bang on the wall and make me feel guilty... for leaving her alone just that little bit.
- She'd always...
- Your mother?
My mother...
Story of my dull life.
What's your apartment like?
It's an old place we furnished ourselves from stuff we picked up in the junk shops.
We both love fixing over old things.
Like me.
You married?
No.
I'm sorry.
I'm stupid and wicked and untrustworthy...
- and not good for anything at all.
- I don't think so.
Maybe just a little tight at the moment.
Tell me something about where you live.
I haven't had it long enough to believe it's my own.
It's a little apartment.
Smaller than yours, I'm sure.
I live alone. I'm still furnishing it.
Buying one thing at a time to make sure I get everything right.
Took me two weeks to find the little stone lions I keep on the mantel.
Brush their teeth every night.
I've got a hunch I better get you back to your apartment as fast as I can.
- Don't say that.
- I only mean...
Why do you all pick on me?
Am I the public dump or something for everybody's fear?
I don't want to leave Hill House ever.
I've been waiting all my life for something like this to happen.
Hey, everybody, come here.
I've found something.
What's wrong with you, Doc?
Stand there, go on.
You, too, girls. Stand there.
A genuine cold spot.
I guarantee it won't register on any thermometer.
Bunk. It's just a draft, that's all.
- Coming from somewhere.
- A draft? In Hill House?
Not unless you can make one of the doors stay open.
No, I found it. The heart of Hill House.
You mean where we're standing?
Behind these doors.
- What's in there?
- The nursery.
Abigail Crain grew up and died there.
- Just the place to chill our beer.
- No, don't go in there.
We'll keep the lid on the pressure cooker a while longer, then.
Now don't give me that, Doc.
It's like the doorway to a tomb.
Bless you.
Now, that's enough, girls.
You'd better run along to bed before you catch cold.
Yes, teacher. Bless you.
Come on.
No. There's got to be a draft.
The floor's solid.
Look, Doc, don't give me any of that supernatural jazz.
This is something I can feel. And see.
Maybe there's a pipeline to the North Pole.
Why won't you accept it for what it is:
A supernatural phenomenon?
You knock on wood, don't you?
Yeah, what's that got to do with it?
It shows that even you, despite yourself... feel that there are forces beyond nature able to help or hurt us.
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me that belief in a superstition... is the same thing as believing in the supernatural?
It's food for thought.
Frozen food for thought.
You know what I think?
Markway has us all so edgy, we're getting the cold sweats.
The temperature needn't drop to make you feel like that.
That's right.
Music gives me goose bumps.
Still, there was that awful smell in the library.
Here we go again. You know very well... what you thought you smelled in the library. The sickroom smell.
Let's discuss me some other time.
I'm tired.
- Turn out the light.
- I'd like it on. Have you seen this?
I told you. I just want to go to sleep.
Good night!
Why be mad at me?
I don't think you killed your mother.
Leave me alone.
Go to sleep!
Good night, Nellie my Nell.
Are you awake?
Don't say a word, Theo. Not a word.
Don't let it know you're in my room.
Hold my hand.
And for God's sake, don't scream.
Is it over? Do you think it's over?
You're breaking my hand.
This is monstrous. This is cruel.
It is hurting a child and I will not let anyone...
anything hurt a child.
I won't endure this. It thinks to scare me.
It has, and poor Theo, too.
Honestly, it feels like she's breaking my hand.
I will take a lot from this filthy house for his sake...
but I will not go along with hurting a child. No, I will not.
I will get my mouth to open right now, and I will yell.
Stop it!
What, Nell?
Oh, God!
Whose hand was I holding?
- Eleanor, too bad. You just missed it.
- What?
The Hill House Concerto for Harp.
Were you playing the harp?
It was playing itself.
Naturally. How do you explain it?
Subterranean waters? Earth tremors?
As a matter of fact,
I don't think it is anything supernatural.
The self-starting music.
More likely it's in the realm of the preternatural.
Something we don't have any natural explanation for right now... but probably will have some day.
The preternatural of one generation becomes the natural of the next.
Not so long ago, scientists laughed at the idea of magnetic attraction.
They couldn't explain it, so they refused to admit it existed.
Life is still full of the preternatural.
My mother...
Go on. Say it.
You've been trying to since you got here.
I don't know what I was going to say.
I'm still so terrified from last night.
You shouldn't be.
It's silly to be frightened.
You haven't been through it.
This horrible unknown thing.
Unknown. That's the key word.
When we get involved in a supernatural event... we're scared out of our wits just because it's unknown.
The night cry of a child.
Face on the wall, knockings, bangings.
What's there to be afraid of?
You weren't threatened. It was harmless, like a joke that didn't come off.
- But the child...
- There was no child.
- Just a voice.
- Worse.
Look, let me put it this way.
When people believed the Earth was flat... the idea of a round world scared them silly.
Then they found out how the round world works.
It's the same with the world of the supernatural.
Until we know how it works... we'll continue to carry around this unnecessary burden of fear.
Supposing it is in my imagination... the knocking, the voices, everything.
Every cursed bit of the haunting.
Suppose the haunting is all in my mind.
You can't say that because there are three other people here.
We all resist the idea... that what ran through the garden the first night was a ghost... what banged on the door was a ghost, what held your hand was a ghost.
But there's certainly something going on in Hill House.
We're getting close, Eleanor, very close to finding out what it is.
I could say all three of you are in my imagination. None of this is real.
Sure. That's the easiest way to dismiss the supernatural... by pleading insanity or accusing others of it.
Maybe I am insane.
The night my mother died... she knocked on the wall.
And I didn't come.
Eleven years of looking in on her after every small noise.
That night... my back hurt and my hands.
It wasn't fair.
We could've afforded a laundress.
I ought to have brought her the medicine.
I always did before.
This time... she called me... and I never answered.
- Is that how a normal person acts?
- Yes.
You were tired and disgusted. 11 years!
You're human.
Stop trying to be either a saint or a martyr.
You probably like thinking it was your fault.
My sister says I wanted Mother to die.
I've wondered ever since if I didn't wake up in the night... and hear her just go back to sleep.
It would have been easy.
- I've wondered about it.
- No, you're not capable of that.
You're a fine person, Eleanor.
Sensitive and honest and thoroughly good.
- Do you really think so, John?
- I do indeed.
Goose bumps.
There isn't by any chance a cold spot in this room, too, is there?
No, there isn't.
"Journeys end in lovers meeting."
All I want is to be cherished.
And here we are listening to that ridiculous harp.
"Lust. Daughter, preserve thyself.
"Hold apart from this world, that its lust corrupt thee not.
"Could you but hear for a moment the agony...
"the screaming..."
Oh, now, get this, congregation.
"...the dreadful crying out of the lustful...
"damned for eternity in everlasting flame!"
- What have you got there?
- I found it in the library.
He made it himself.
Look.
"Memories for Abigail Lester Crain:
"A legacy for her education and enlightenment.
"From her devoted father,
Hugh Desmond Lester Crain...
"Hill House, October 21, 1873."
- But that's today.
- Tomorrow and 90 years later.
Some nursery book, huh?
"Honor the authors of thy being, daughter.
"Thy father and thy mother."
Just the thing to give a child at bedtime.
No family should be without one.
I can see him now spitting out the words so they take root in her little mind.
Hugh Crain, you were a dirty man and you made a dirty house.
If you can hear me,
I'm telling you to your face...
I hope you spend eternity in that foul, rotten book... and never stop burning for a minute.
- Don't be a bore, Nell. Sit down and we'll...
- Leave me alone.
You are a bore.
I've got it. I'll tear out the pictures... and send them as Christmas cards to my New England relatives.
I think it's funny. "Dear Uncle Ned:
Merry Christmas, may your soul..."
Close that book.
It's enough to set anyone's nerves on edge.
It's not the book that's making our Nell nervous.
She's worried about her apartment.
I didn't know.
Is there anything I can do to help?
She thinks she's being funny.
Tell me, Dr. Markway, are you fond of stone lions...
- the kind you keep on the mantel?
- Shut up, Theo.
Do you long for a tiny home, something smaller than Hill House?
There's room for two, isn't there, Nell?
You're a monster, Theo.
You're the monster of Hill House.
- You'd better go with her.
- Wouldn't you rather?
I said go with her.
She shouldn't be left in that room alone.
Here you are. Okay, Isolde.
- Tristan wants you inside.
- Leave me alone.
Stop trying to be the center of attention.
- Come inside.
- You revolt me.
Can't you take a joke?
I didn't know you were serious about Markway.
Of course you did.
But he shouldn't be allowed to get away with it.
Get away with what?
- You're making a fool of yourself over him.
- Suppose I'm not, though.
You'd mind terribly if you turned out to be wrong for once.
- You poor stupid innocent.
- I'd rather be innocent than like you.
Meaning what?
Now who's being stupid and innocent?
- You know perfectly well what I mean.
- Is this one of your crazy hallucinations?
- I'm not crazy.
- Crazy as a loon.
You expect me to believe you're sane and the rest of the world is mad?
Why not?
The world is full of inconsistencies.
Unnatural things. "Nature's mistakes," they're called. You, for instance.
A reporter's been telephoning all day.
He's on your track.
- He's heard about you renting this place.
- How?
The Dudleys, I bet.
They must've blabbed in town.
Come back with me now, please.
If they find out why you're here, the papers'll have a field day.
Who are you?
Grace Markway.
Didn't John tell you he's married?
- I tried to warn you.
- Welcome to our party.
Who are you?
We're researchers in the field of psychic phenomena.
Please go.
You couldn't have arrived at a worse time.
Stop this insanity, John, and come back with me.
I can't. Not now.
I'm convinced we're on the verge of a breakthrough.
Here you are, driver, that'll be all.
But I had to come. I had to.
I've waited such a long time.
I've earned my happiness.
I was afraid this would be your attitude.
I'm not leaving here until you've got sense enough to leave with me.
I hope no one minds if I join the ghost hunt.
All right, I'll put your things in my room.
I'll be very disappointed if I don't see a ghost.
Hadn't you better put me in the ghastly dungeon... or the mysterious secret chamber?
There are no dungeons, no secret chambers in Hill House.
In fact, nothing romantic at all.
It's a deadly serious place.
- Not even a treasure buried in the cellar?
- There's the nursery.
Thank you, my dear. The nursery it is.
You must listen to me.
Certain things have happened here.
You may not believe in the supernatural, but these are physical facts.
Mrs. Markway, please...
Don't sleep in the nursery.
I didn't realize what I was saying.
You insult my intelligence.
You don't think I'd believe anything you ghost hunters might tell me.
Even so, you shouldn't sleep in that room.
It hasn't been opened since we've been here.
I agree with you about the spook bit,
Mrs. M, but it's true, the air might be bad.
Oh, poisonous.
I've just remembered. No problem.
I don't have the key to the nursery, and the Dudleys have gone for the night.
Incidentally, how'd you get through the gate?
Very supernatural. With a key.
Your Mrs. Dudley is quite human,
I assure you... and not at all averse to a $5 bill.
Hey, look.
From your expressions,
I gather that is the dreaded nursery.
And as for the bad air, it's quite the opposite.
There seems to be a draft.
Wait a minute, Doc.
This is ridiculous.
Nobody opened these doors.
That's right, Luke.
You're beginning to see the light.
I haven't seen a damn thing.
I just don't like the way it looks.
Now I know who your fiend of Hill House is.
The interior decorator.
Evidently Mrs. Dudley doesn't get in here very often.
Looks the same as the rest of the house to me.
It's no use, Grace. The air in here is stale.
I can take care of that.
Only one way to argue with a woman, Doc. Don't.
Good night.
My mother...
This room is the cold, rotten heart of the house.
Since you're so foolish, I'll stay with you.
But you're not to be in this room alone tonight.
I can't go on watching you waste your life on all this nonsense.
If there is such a thing as a haunted house, this is my chance to find out.
All right.
John, my bag.
At least leave the door open.
Don't worry.
I've brought a special ghost trap with me.
What if he does have a wife?
I still have a place in this house.
I belong. I want to stay here.
It's the only time anything's ever happened to me.
He can't make me leave, not if Hill House means me to stay.
Go away, Eleanor, we don't want you anymore, you can't stay.
But I can.
He doesn't make the rules around here.
Nell, I'm talking to you.
- I'm sorry.
- What's the matter?
Didn't you hear Markway?
He doesn't want us to stay here.
He wants us to spend the night downstairs in the parlor.
Luke and he will take turns watching on this floor.
For Pete's sake, snap out of it.
- Why aren't you upstairs?
- I needed a drink.
- Grace.
- Wait a minute.
It's nowhere near the nursery, it's down here.
It seems to me we've been on this kick before.
Next vacation
I must really go somewhere else.
It knows my name.
This time it knows my name.
- I'll have to go out there.
- No!
- It hasn't hurt me. Why should it hurt her?
- She might try to do something about it.
Is it over, Theo? Is it?
No, I'm so cold.
It's going to start everything all over again.
It can't get in. Don't let it get in.
Oh, God, it knows I'm here.
Doc, I'll let you have the house cheap.
It will go on and on and come back again until it finds me.
On and on until it finds me.
It's at the nursery.
- You must be crazy!
- I'm going out there!
Not with that thing out there.
- We have to, Luke. She's there!
- Don't be crazy.
I've got to find out if Grace is all right.
I don't know what it is, but I don't want to find out...
I've got to get out of here.
I've got to find out if Grace is all right.
- No, don't.
- Cut it out!
I'll come.
Whatever it wants of me it can have.
The house is coming down around me.
The house is destroying itself.
It's in the nursery.
Mrs. Markway?
Please.
Grace, are you...
Where is she?
- Where is she? What did you see?
- Nothing.
She wasn't here.
- What happened?
- She's gone.
Where? How?
Good God!
Markway, if this is your idea of a joke... if living in a haunted house has done this to you...
We'll start here, then the whole house.
- Even if we have to tear the place apart.
- You can't do that.
If we don't find her, the police will be around.
I'm coming apart, a little at a time.
Now I know where I'm going.
I'm disappearing inch by inch into this house.
We killed her. You and I, Hugh Crain.
She must be around this house somewhere.
Maybe this whole thing is a bad joke.
- She isn't the kind who makes jokes.
- You find her, she's your wife.
I'm taking Nell and I'm clearing out of here.
Where is Eleanor?
I want to stay here.
I want to stay here always.
I will not be frightened or alone anymore.
Has anyone checked outside?
Please, Nell, where are you?
Here I am, inside.
It's not cold at all and the smell is gone.
I've broken the spell of Hill House.
I'm home.
No stone lions for me. I am home.
I will not look back...
because then they will know what I am thinking.
Eleanor, turn around and come down.
Now, be very, very careful.
Come down.
All that is gone and left behind.
Eleanor, for God's sake!
- Wait a minute. This thing will collapse...
- It can't possibly hold the both of you.
Just turn around, Eleanor.
Keep hold of the rail and start down slowly.
Stand still! Don't move!
Stand perfectly still!
Nell, do what they say, please!
I'm coming on the platform.
Now come along.
Are you sure, Eleanor?
It was Mrs. Markway.
Just before I fainted, I looked up, and there she was above the trap door.
What's more, she's still around.
I don't know who or what you really saw, Eleanor.
But whatever it was, we can't risk letting it happen again.
- That's why you're leaving now.
- But I can't leave now.
- I brought the car round front. She ready?
- She's all packed. Take her suitcase.
No, please, Luke, let me stay.
I'll help Mrs. Dudley.
All it will cost you is just my keep.
Sorry, honey, but you're not the type I keep.
- I can't leave, I tell you.
- I can't take any more chances.
I realize now what a terrible thing
I was asking of you all.
You're leaving as quickly as you can.
Then we'll find Grace or go to the police.
It isn't fair.
I'm the one who's supposed to stay here.
She's taken my place.
Don't worry.
Luke will see you get there safely.
- Get where?
- Why, home, of course.
Go back to your own little apartment where all your things are.
I haven't any home.
I made it up.
No apartment, no things...
Everything in all the world that belongs to me... is in that suitcase and a carton in my car.
So you see, there's no place you can send me.
I have to stay here.
You must have lived somewhere before.
- You had an address where I wrote you.
- My sister's.
I sleep on a couch in the living room.
I'd be much happier here.
I can't go back to my sister's.
Yes, you can, and immediately.
This is a mistake. Don't you understand?
The house wants me.
Mrs. Markway can't satisfy it.
No one else can.
Forget about this house as soon as you can.
No, please. I'm fine now. I'm not afraid.
I was happy here.
- I don't think Mrs. Markway will be.
- Put the bag in the car, Luke.
Nell is right. Grace is around somewhere.
- You see?
- Please, there's no time to waste.
Please, let me stay. I'm the only one who can call Mrs. Markway back.
I was wrong. I should have sent you home the first night.
This is the only time anything's ever happened to me.
I'm the one it really wants.
Can't you feel it? It's alive.
Watching... waiting...
Waiting for me.
I won't go away.
You will go away. Right now.
- No, come on.
- I'll drive. It's my car.
At least, half mine.
All right, let her.
I can't stand here arguing.
Thank you for rescuing me in the library.
That was wrong of me, I know, but I'm all right now, honestly.
I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry, really.
Goodbye.
Let's get moving.
I thought you weren't going to say goodbye.
Nellie my Nell, be happy, please be happy.
Everything's going to be all right.
I'm sure Grace is here and we'll find her.
So don't worry.
She has my place. It isn't fair.
Goodbye, Eleanor.
I'll write you. Drive carefully.
Goodbye.
Who do I thank for a lovely time?
Oh, hold it. Markway!
The key.
- To the gate.
- Yes, of course.
What fools they are.
The house tricks them so easily.
Just by telling me to go away, they can't make me leave.
They can't shut me out.
Not if Hill House means me to stay.
- Eleanor.
- Wait.
So now I'm going.
But I won't go. Hill House belongs to me.
I knew it.
Hill House doesn't want me to go.
Stop it. Please. What are you doing?
Let go.
What are you doing?
Why don't they stop me?
Can't they see what is happening?
But it's happening to you, Eleanor.
Yes. Something at last is really...
really happening to me.
She's dead.
I didn't want any of this to happen.
You must believe me, John.
What were you doing? What happened?
That terrible house.
I woke up and I was frightened.
So I tried to find your room, but I got lost.
Almost as though the house were doing it on purpose.
And I ended up in the attic.
I was only trying to find a way out when I opened the trap door.
I wasn't trying to frighten her.
- Didn't you see me?
- No, but Eleanor did.
The shock of seeing you almost killed her.
She did kill her.
Seeing her is what made Eleanor lose control of the car.
No. She only saw me the very last instant.
The same time I saw her.
I don't even know how I got out here.
It wasn't your fault.
Eleanor did it to herself.
It looked to me, anyway, like she... deliberately aimed the car at this tree.
Where the first Mrs. Crain was also killed in an "accident."
Here's the mark.
There was something in the car with her,
I'm sure of it.
Call it what you like, but Hill House is haunted.
It didn't want her to leave, and her poor bedeviled mind... wasn't strong enough to fight it.
- Poor Eleanor.
- Maybe not "poor" Eleanor.
It was what she wanted, to stay here.
She had no place else to go.
The house belongs to her now, too.
Maybe she's happier.
You wait here, Grace.
I'll go and get your things and call the police.
No one must go in that house again.
Whatever is there might...
I'll be all right.
The house has what it wants... for a while.
It ought to be burned down and the ground sowed with salt.
Hill House has stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more.
Within, walls continue upright, bricks meet...
floors are firm, and doors are sensibly shut.
Silence lies steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House.
And we who walk here walk alone.
SHINDO: This is the susukigrass
This place was difficult to find
First we went to Adachigahara...
...where there is a legend of a she-demon...
...but the area had been developed
One of the assistant directors...
...travelled right around
Mt. Fuji looking for a place...
...but the grass fields were either being used by the military...
...or had been split up
He finally decided to look near the marshes...
...and went to Inbanuma in Chiba where he found this place
He wanted me to take a look...
...so I went to see
It was just what we were looking for...
...so we decided to film there
We had problems later with the stones and the bogs...
...but I didn't see any of that then
I just saw the grass rustling in the wind and thought this is perfect
Ever since we made Ningen...
...we'd always lodged together when filming...
...but there was no suitable place to stay nearby...
...so we decided to build...
...a prefabricated house at the site
The susukigrass is like having a black background
There is nothing to get in the way
It also provides a symbolic setting...
...for the Civil War period...
...and I wanted the grass swaying in the wind...
...to express the psychological nature of the film
We were also working to a small budget...
...so we needed to use the minimum number of people...
...and this place was perfect for that
SATO: I hear the production budget was 15 million yen. Is that right?
SHINDO: About that
In today's terms that's about 300 million yen
That's Kaji Kentaro
JY: They're father and son...
...aren't they?
SHINDO: Yes. That's his son-in-law
JY: The susuki grass is beautiful and...
...it's very effective...
...psychologically
SHINDO: Taro Okamoto also said...
...that the grass made a fine background
I'm glad that we decided to use the grass fields...
...but it made filming very difficult
SATO: I read the production notes again the other day
They say how you had a flash of inspiration...
...about the hole which helped you to write the script
SHINDO: I felt that the hole signifies...
...the process by which people survived
History tells us that during...
...the Civil War period...
...the civilian population clung on precariously...
...at the edge of existence...
...which means that we are here today...
...because they managed to survive
It shows the strength of the people...
...at the bottom of the social heap
I thought of depicting the harsh everyday life...
...of people who put...
...food on their plates...
...by murdering others
I don't mean that the hole is connected directly to this in any way...
...but I wanted to use it as a metaphor...
...for this way of survival
SATO: The hole was like a disused well, wasn't it?
SHINDO: Yes
How old were you when you made this, Jitsuko?
JY: I think I was about 19
SHINDO: You were brimming with vitality then
JY: It was only my third film.
I didn't know anything
SATO: You look as fresh as a daisy
JY: I watched the film the other day after many years
I really enjoyed it
The clothes we wore in the film were supposed...
...to have been stolen, too
You gave us two sets of clothes...
...and asked us to make sure they looked old...
...so I slept in mine
I expect Nobuko did the same
SHINDO: The clothes were linen
I designed them myself...
JY: Really?
SHINDO: And had them dyed
Nobuko's outfit had a crab design
JY: Mine was a fan motif
That was almost 40 years ago
I've forgotten so much
SHINDO: The reason the film is still so clear...
...is because it was shot in black and white
If it had been colour, the colour would have faded by now
JY: In black and white...
...it's more impressive
SHINDO: I'm still nostalgic about black and white now
When they invented film...
...they couldn't do colour at first...
...so they started with black and white
But there are actually seven shades of grey in black and white
It represents colour in the same way...
...as an Indian ink drawing
It has that depth
SATO: It is much better than badly used colour
The susuki grass, too
JY: Absolutely
SATO: It stirs the imagination
JY: That's right
SHINDO: In that sense, black and white is superior
It should have been...
...invented after colour
All you have to do with colour is film it as it is
We built this set ourselves
SATO: It was tough for the assistant directors
SHINDO: They had it tough
They were covered in cuts and bruises
We had eight assistant directors
There are usually four
We wanted them to gain...
...a wide range of experience
We were an independent production company...
...so we didn't rely on any outside people
We wanted to do everything ourselves
That's how we did things
JY: Eight AD's?
SHINDO: That's right
SATO: Some were straight out of university, weren't they
SHINDO: Some out of university, some were amateurs, some were veterans...
They were all mixed together
It was an interesting blend
We did everything there on location
It all took time and effort
SATO: If I remember right...
...you used about
30 kilowatts of lighting
SHINDO: That's right
We used about 30 kilowatts
We didn't use lights in the day
Just when we filmed...
...in the evening or the morning
SATO: Living on location gave you plenty of time
You could be very flexible
You could snatch a single cut...
...when the wind or the light was just right
SHINDO: That's right
It was like living and sleeping on the set
We could be very versatile
It's an interesting way of doing things...
...but it's stressful because you're shut in
But when you have a job to do, I think it's best...
...to keep people captive at the place they're working
JY: Oh, really?
SHINDO: If you don't do that, people can't commit themselves
I think everyone wants to be kept captive...
...so that they can get on with their work
JY: I think it's only you who thinks that
We got to go to Tokyo once every three weeks
Or was it every 2 weeks?
SHINDO: Every 3 weeks
JY: One thing I remember clearly...
...is that you didn't go back to Tokyo at all
Why was that?
SHINDO: I wanted to stay at the location continuously
I felt that I needed to stay there...
...to maintain my feel for the place
JY: Really? I didn't know what you were thinking
I just thought yahoo! A holiday!
I think it was two days and one night
I was so happy
I suppose there were taxis, but...
SHINDO: You wouldn't have got taxis out there
JY: We all piled into two trucks
It was about 10 minutes to the station wasn't it?
SHINDO: It was 4 kilometres
JY: So it was about 10 minutes
We went to the station to catch the train to Tokyo
We were all so excited
We stayed one night and then came back the next evening
We arrived at the station and the trucks were waiting for us
Then it was back to work
SHINDO: This is a canal, but it looks like...
...a continental river because there's no flow
JY: It was beautiful
SATO: It's man-made
It was built to take...
...the overflow from the marshes down to the river
SHINDO: There's a dam a little further along
This is where Kei appears
The reason I made him a monk...
...was that he wouldn't have to wear a wig
It would just appear that his hair had grown
JY: You were lucky, Kei
SATO: And the clothes would have kept me safe
SHINDO: That's right
With monk's clothes...
...he would have been safe on the road
JY: Nobuko and I both wore wigs
SHINDO: But it was mostly your own hair
We just added a little
It was hard work rigging the lighting here because the roof was so low
SATO: It caught fire once
SHINDO: That's right
SATO: You were the first one to escape when the fire started, Jitsuko
JY: Was I really?
SATO: You were the first out of the door
JY: Because I was young
SHINDO: It was hard going for everyone
But because you were all held captive in one place...
...there was nowhere to escape to and we had plenty of time
JY: Yes, we had lots of time
SHINDO: Because we had so much time... it felt as if we could be relaxed about things... mind you, it was hot
SATO: God, it was hot!
SHINDO: Not only that...
The reeds and the scenery may look cool...
...but the hot, stifling smell of the grass was terrible
I remember Kei saying that...
...we ran the risk of catching a nasty disease from the mites if we filmed there
We were lucky though...
...because no-one got sick
SATO: When Masaki Kobayashi was filming The Human Condition...
...up in Sarobetsu in Hokkaido...
...the locals warned him about the danger of disease from mites
When they had to go into the swamp...
...they wrapped themselves in plastic underneath their clothes
They were worried, but they didn't catch anything
SHINDO: It would have been quite natural to get sick in a place like that
SATO: That's right
SHINDO: I didn't know it until later...
...but the area where the marsh meets the reed beds...
...is a very primitive environment
It was like that tens of thousands of years ago
It looks as if you could walk along quite easily...
...but it's so boggy you would sink in up to your waist
SATO: Does it belong to the Water Agency?
SHINDO: Yes, it's managed by the Water Agency
We got permission to use it...
...and built the set there
Because we did it here we didn't have to worry about onlookers
We basically had a cast of three
It was good because we could focus that way
You wouldn't have been able to appear in anything else...
...with a beard like that anyway
It was lucky for us
Mind you it was rough for the actors, wasn't it?
SATO: I wasn't much in demand anyway
SHINDO: That's not true
SATO: I arrived at the set about one week...
...after shooting had started
There was a bath and a toilet by then
JY: There were separate toilets for men and women
SATO: I remember these small, yellow...
...poisonous moths appeared once
One of the crew was sitting in the bath...
...with a rash all over his body
SHINDO: Talk about moths to the flame
The insects would emerge in swarms in the evening
SATO: It was amazing
SHINDO: I thought there were only...
...one or two types of insect that come out at night...
...but there were scores of different types
JY: Were there that many?
SHINDO: One type would arrive en masse...
...stay for a week and then disappear
Then a different type would turn up
The insects were terrible
They would drop to the floor...
...and the crawfish would come to eat them
SATO: We used a light trap and caught hundreds of them
SHINDO: They came pouring in and dropped down dead
SATO: We burnt them all with gasoline
It was crazy
When we filmed at night the insects would...
...come flying into your mouth when you tried to say your lines
SHINDO: That's right
But the daytime was a hard grind, too
SATO: The ADs had it tough
SHINDO: There wasn't much to do at night...
...so we passed the time cremating insects
SATO: You would go to bed early because you don't drink
But a few of us would sit out on the embankment...
...drinking till midnight
JY: You drank on the embankment?
I didn't know that
SATO: If we had sat outside, it would have been too noisy
SHINDO: It's slightly cooler out there by the river, too
Sitting and drinking on the riverbank
It's not something you get to do every day
JY: It was a priceless experience
SHINDO: If we'd had the money...
...we could have provided all sorts of facilities...
...but I think it was better this way
This sort of primitive style is better, isn't it?
SATO: I think so
SHINDO: Our primitive lifestyle matched the film itself
Simple food and cheap dried fish
You'd think we'd have all kinds of fresh fish...
...staying next to a swamp
But we didn't
SATO: There were grass carp
JY: Were they big?
SATO: About one metre long
SHINDO: Grass carp were introduced from China
There were snake head mullet, too
They can actually come onto the land for a while
They look a bit like snakes
SATO: The grass carp ate up all the small fish in the area
They built a fish pen for them on the bank...
...but they were still wiped out
SHINDO: They caught the small fish and put them in a fish pen
SHINDO: Didn't you have moxibustion treatment on your stomach...
...to increase your weight when we were doing Ningen, Kei?
You have plenty of meat on you here
SATO: Ningen was two years before this
I only weighed 48kg at the time
After six months of treatment
I was up to 73kg
Onibaba was only two years after that
SHINDO: You were a bit chubby then
SATO: I'd lost a bit of weight then
I was about 70kg here
SHINDO: Yes, I thought you were quite big then
JY: Is that a snake head mullet you're holding?
SHINDO: No, it's a crucian carp
SATO: A big one
There wouldn't have been any grass carp or snake head mullet...
...in those days
They were only introduced after the war
SHINDO: 19 years old?
You're just brimming with youth
SATO: Your skin is glowing
JY: I watched the film again a few days ago...
I could hardly believe I was so young once
It made me happy to see
SHINDO: Of course
That's natural
The mud beneath the reeds was like a quagmire
It was very unpleasant, but we were lucky...
...that no-one got sick
JY: We were very lucky
SATO: We didn't take any precautions either
SHINDO: We didn't have any medical facilities
Our budget didn't stretch to that
JY: We didn't have any inoculations
SATO: We didn't do anything like that
SHINDO: None of the ADs got sick either
JY: That's right
SHINDO: When the ADs got stressed out they would...
...run marathons to the railway station in the evening
SATO: Did they do that?
SHINDO: They wanted to burn up their energy
JY: I didn't know that
SHINDO: The day after a holiday...
...I would sometimes go up and wait on the embankment...
...and would watch as people came trickling back in ones and twos
I was relieved to see them
They returned but they'd been thinking
SATO: Did you think they'd escape?
SHINDO: Yes. I thought some people would run away
JY: But no-one did?
SHINDO: No-one did
Maybe they just didn't have the time to think of escaping
SATO: That was the year of the Tokyo Olympics
Even when you got away to Tokyo, it was noisy and crowded
SHINDO: You don't get many opportunities...
...for a group of people to focus...
...on a single task like this
SATO: The samurai over there is Hiroshi Tanaka
He became famous doing that ham commercial
He was a stand-in for Mifune, wasn't he?
It was the boneless ham
SHINDO: He's actually quite small, but he's wearing armour
It's not funny...
...but he almost drowned
I could have filmed the scene in separate cuts...
...but I wanted to film the whole scene to give it power
That's why we did it this way
That's how we did it, but it was serious
SATO: I was really worried
SHINDO: You were impatient
SATO: No I was worried
SHINDO: In the film, I mean
You were impatient waiting for him to arrive
You spear him here
JY: After all that effort to swim across
SATO: The water was dirty
SHINDO: It looks clean, but it was dirty
SATO: That's Yamaguchi
Tanaka was Mitsugu
Terajima's son, wasn't he?
SHINDO: I think he was related to the wife of the cameraman
That's how he came to be with us
I used him because he also did some stunt work
There was no point in rehearsing this
They just had to react as they went along
They turned this into a ballet in America
An American production company...
...is interested in buying the story
It's a simple story
It's a very traditional folktale...
...and this folktale has...
...the man and woman relationship
It's simple
SATO: It was about this time that
Tonoyama stopped drinking
SHINDO: That's right. He shouted out,
'I'm giving up drinking from today! '...
...but nobody paid a blind bit of notice
Why did you used to call
Tonoyama-san...
...by the nickname oyabin?
SATO: It comes from the words oyabun
[meaning 'the boss']...
...and hagechabin [meaning 'a bald person']
[Short discussion about etymology]
JY: I worked with Tonoyama...
...on films after this
He was very shy
I remember if I teased him...
...he would just look down and grin sheepishly
SHINDO: He was a cultured man
SATO: He was intelligent
SHINDO: Yes and he was a humble man
He was a cultured man and intelligent...
...and a funny person
He was an interesting fellow
JY: I think everybody had times..
...when they were stressed out...
...and wanted to go home
I had that feeling at times...
...but Nobuko looked after me
I can only remember the happy times now
SHINDO: You were young...
...and everyone was eager l just let people do their thing
You were all enthusiastic
JY: Did we rehearse?
SHINDO: No
SATO: We just did a camera test
JY: The set was only about five minutes from where we stayed
I thought we did a bit of rehearsal...
...but it's over thirty years ago and I can't remember
SATO: Maybe you did some practice by yourself
JY: I wasn't that serious
SHINDO: There was no point in rehearsal
There's no way to rehearse how to bite into a chunk of meat
It wasn't a specific type of acting
We were portraying humans reduced...
...almost to the level of beasts
There's no way to rehearse that
Simply staying in that place together...
...was a sufficient rehearsal
JY: That feeling that we were all in it together...
...was very different from the two films I'd done before that
SHINDO: I went to Montreal last year [1999]...
...and screened Onibaba and The Naked Island
The people I met in the cafés knew Onibaba
When we met, they would all say 'Ah, Onibaba, Onibaba'
You could hear them:
'Onibaba, Onibaba'
It's very simple and straightforward...
...and people overseas appreciated it as well
It was very popular
'Onibaba, Onibaba' they said!
I took four prints and they screened them two at a time...
...at the main venue
Film made its appearance in the 20th century...
...and now you can see
Nobuko like this...
...even though she's no longer with us
In some respect the viewpoint of life and death has changed
The voice remains...
JY: When I saw the titles at the beginning...
...I was shocked to think that so many of those people...
...have passed away
We might be the only three left
SHINDO: Kuroda, the cameraman...
...the lighting man...
...Shige who did the makeup...
JY: Uno, Tonoyama, Tanaka...
...and Sonesho are all dead
It's just the three of us
And you're the fittest of us all
SHINDO: I think not.
I'm 89 years old
SATO: How old where you when you made Onibaba?
SHINDO: Fifty-five
I was fit then
Breath is important for...
...acting and for directing
If you have no breath...
...left in your lungs after you have breathed out...
...you lose your power
When your breath is used up and doesn't come out anymore...
...it is useless
JY: You've gone crazy here, Kei
SHINDO: The film doesn't look at all dated
JY: That's right
SHINDO: I added the cooing of pigeons...
...to the scene when you are running
I heard that pigeons are known for their fecundity...
...so I added the sound to the scene where Jitsuko...
...is running through the grass in the grip of desire
I added it for effect
JY: I didn't know that
SHINDO: Hikaru Hayashi also came to the set
JY: I ran like the wind then
I was covered in scratches
If I tried that now...
...I'd have a heart attack
SHINDO: We could make it appear...
...to be night...
...because we filmed in black and white
If you adjust the contrast...
...use a red filter..
...and emphasize the black...
...then you are able to...
...turn day into night
This technique was developed for black and white film
I'm not sure who invented it
SATO: Can't you do it with colour?
SHINDO: No, not with colour
The picture would be dark
It just becomes darker
There's an effect that occurs
If you increase the contrast in black and white film...
...it has the effect of accentuating the white...
...so the image becomes clearer
The effect can be quite strange
It's very effective
We filmed the susuki grass...
...with and without lights
If the lights are switched on...
...the sky becomes dark...
...and the grass appears white
Without light, the grass becomes black and the sky white
The two can be used as a montage to create an interesting effect
I took this shot at about 3.5 times speed
They usually shoot running giraffes...
...and other animals at between...
...3.5 and 5 times normal speed
From the start, I wanted the swaying of the susuki grass...
...to express the psychological nature...
...of the film
JY: Neither Nobuko nor I had names...
...but Hachi and...
...my dead husband did...
SHINDO: I used you as symbols...
Why was that?
...to represent people
As a person who would be able...
...to represent the populace
You can only get this kind of effect with black and white film
We couldn't film on cloudy days
You don't get the effect of black and white film...
...unless you have clear blue skies
In the old days, we would wait for clear weather to film
Nowadays you can get vivid colours regardless...
...of whether it's cloudy or not
There's no need to fear the clouds...
...you can shoot to your heart's content
On the other side of the coin...
...people now take less care...
...in composing their shots
SHINDO: How long did you stay on location?
SATO: Was it June we started?
JY: I think I was there for three months
SHINDO: It took a long time...
...because we had to wait for the weather
SATO: According to these records...
...filming started 30June 1964 and I joined in July
We finished up on 9 September
Shindo, Kuroda and Shirota...
...left on the two o'clock train...
...on 9 October
It says that they departed under leaden skies with heavy hearts
SHINDO: Whenever I start...
...a new project...
...it feels as if I'm beginning a new life
And when the time comes...
...when the work ends...
...it feels as if one life...
...has come to an end
SATO: When an actor has played his part he goes home
When the sound man and other crew have done their jobs, they go home
The director stays till the end
SHINDO: That's right
I suppose it's mentally...
...and physically tiring
But it's the actors...
...who do the running...
...and all the director has to do...
...is watch them perform
I admire actors
JY: Thank you
Mind you, I suppose they do it...
...because it's interesting...
...so I shouldn't worry too much about them
But actors are a breed apart
SATO: I always have a bit of...
...a guilty conscience as an actor
Whether it's film or stage...
...the actor works to a script...
...and has someone to direct him
...and yet he plays it as if it is all his own work
It's like he's cheating the audience and the director
JY: Because I'm impudent
I don't feel like that
SATO: It's shyness
SHINDO: I can understand that
A director also has a feeling of impotence
Because he doesn't actually do it
He orders people about, but doesn't actually do it himself
He leaves everything to other people
It's like there's a glass wall...
...in front of you
It's frustrating
SATO: Yes, it must be frustrating for a director
Especially when the actors can't get it right
SHINDO: No, it's not that
If the film turns out well, the director gets the credit...
...but he didn't really...
...do it himself
It's funny, when I speak to actors...
...who do stage work...
...they still find it interesting...
...even when they are performing...
...the same role...
...day after day
SATO: Not me
I like a one-off performance
I don't mind rehearsing for two weeks...
...or a month
That's necessary...
...to understand the script
But I just want to do one performance
SHINDO: It's a different audience every day
SATO: That's true
But I like to do it just once
SHINDO: I'm the same
As a director, I only want to shoot a scene once
I don't want to go back and do it again
It doesn't work well if I do
Even if you see something that's not right...
...in the rushes and you decide to retake it...
...it's not good enough
If you retake it, it never looks right
It's as if you have painted over the top of it
You need to start with a blank sheet
It's all or nothing
SATO: First time is best for acting as well
JY: There is a tension in it
SATO: From the second try onward...
...you are aiming for safety
SHINDO: Actors are artists
They are creative
They create something from unknown spaces within...
...using their bodies...
...and their actions
They work from morning to night...
...but that doesn't mean they do it best...
...at the end of the day
Kenji Mizoguchi said the same thing
He would sometimes do test runs for a whole day...
...and he said that people often got worse the more they tried
JY: Maybe because they were tired
SHINDO: We burned tyres to get the smoke here
It was really hard work just getting over there to do it
Not for me, but for the ADs
We just watched it
It was the little things like that...
...which took time
That's why we were there three months
For example, if a clump of reeds fell down...
...we would have to bring some more in and prop them up
They look beautiful...
...but there are plenty of shots where we had to prop them up
It was all hard work
JY: The reeds were so high
SHINDO: They are about twice the height of a person
These are reeds
There were two types of reed...
...as well as the susukigrass
JY: Someone said that it's scary to run through...
...the susukigrass, but it wasn't just grass
There were reeds, too
SHINDO: We built a well to film...
...but it was destroyed...
...in the typhoon
All kinds of things like that happened
He's imitating the barking of a dog
JY: It's so many years since I saw the film
There were so many love scenes
SATO: It's surprising
JY: I was surprised how many
SATO: They were necessary to show...
...Nobuko's jealousy
JY: I was so young and Kei had had his...
...moxibustion treatment...
...we both had magnificent bodies then
[They are laughing at their Japanese wordplay]
SHINDO: Are you still doing it?
SATO: Not anymore
But the clinic's still there
I mentioned it on the TV...
...and I still get letters...
...asking me where it is
SHINDO: Does it really work?
SATO: If you do it seriously
You can't do it half-heartedly...
...it will have the opposite effect
You have to follow the instructions exactly
It takes one year
It won't work if you give up halfway
You must be determined to change your condition
I gained weight...
...and it felt as if...
SHINDO: That's true for everything
Not just improving your health
It felt as if my cells themselves had changed
SHINDO: Your cells?
Was your brain the same?
SATO: No, that got worse!
I ate five meals a day
Mostly rice
I don't know why...
...but rice was easy to digest
It took four hours to digest completely...
...and so I had to eat every 4 hours.
JY: Even during shooting?
SATO: Yes
JY: I didn't notice
SHINDO: Not Onibaba
SATO: That was when we shot Ningen
SATO: If you don't eat at the right time...
...the treatment will have...
...the opposite effect
Because of the effect on the intestine...
...unless food is eaten properly...
...you will get an upset stomach
It can cause an abnormal gas...
...which can fill the stomach...
...and cause diarrhea
JY: So you ate...
SATO: So I had to eat every four hours
SHINDO: It was good for us, Kei-san...
...because you lost that civilized look
SATO: If I hadn't put on weight,
I wouldn't have been hired
I have moxibustion to thank for that
SHINDO: And slowing your brain down was just right for the part
SATO: I was always slow witted
SHINDO: So you became more savage
SATO: I couldn't get much slower
SHINDO: Fundamentally, you are the scientific type
You had the treatment just in time then
The swaying grass is very effective
SATO: It's very effective
JY: I think I must have ran away
JY: I must have run all the way back to Tokyo
SHINDO: We could see the night sky in the distance illuminated by Tokyo
There was lightening, too
We all watched it...
...and it made us want to go home...
...back to Tokyo
But we kept on going
SHINDO: Hayashi's music is dynamic
The mask was made...
...by a famous mask maker in Kyoto
We had two made...
...because one needs to be broken later
The mask maker is dead now, too
He made us a magnificent mask
The story is based on 'The Mask of Flesh' story
The monk, Rennyo, was the 8th Patriarch...
...of Shin Buddhism
Until then the teachings of the sect were not well known...
...so Rennyo set about to change that...
He was a great communicator...
...and had enormous vitality...
...and, since there was no printing at that time...
...he wrote hundreds of pages...
...of stories every day to distribute to the people
One of the stories he wrote...
...was the simple tale of 'The Mask of Flesh'
A daughter-in-law regularly attended the temple
Her mother-in-law didn't like it and tried to stop her...
...by donning a mask to frighten her away from the temple
The Buddha punished her by making it impossible...
...to remove the mask
When the daughter-in-law heard what had happened...
...she prayed to the Buddha and the grip of the mask was released
In those days, daughter-in-laws were often...
...treated badly by their in-laws
But they were important to produce the next generation
Rennyo thought that he could recruit followers by targeting these women
He wrote the story to warn in-laws...
...against maltreating their daughters-in-law
SATO: I heard that story when I was young
I'm from Aizu in Fukushima
My parents were in the Nichren sect I think
SHINDO: It's a famous
Buddhist story
SATO: I heard it from my grandmother
SHINDO: The story was written in Yoshizaki
...in Fukui
The Shin Buddhists were being persecuted by another sect...
...and Rennyo escaped there
He would return to challenge his persecutors later...
...but while there he wrote powerful tales...
...such as this one as a means of attracting followers
It's easy to understand for farming folk It's a simple story
SATO: It was no longer a religious story
It became a folktale
SHINDO: It's been handed down over many years...
...because of its simplicity...
...and its universal...
...human theme of the difficult relationship...
...between a bride and her mother-in-law
It resonates to this day
As for the mask being used...
...to hide the ugly face of a General...
...that was my idea
I interpreted the story in a contemporary way
But that was the original story
A mother goes to the temple in the evening
She listens to the sermon...
...and falls asleep...
...because the sermon is boring
The priest knows that...
...and there is a tacit agreement between them
The priest makes his sermon boring...
...so that the woman can sleep
She is tired from her day's work...
...and comes to the temple...
...in the evening for a rest
She can't leave the children at home...
...so she brings them to the temple, too
At the temple they are given...
...a sweet bun...
...so the children want to...
...go to the temple to get the bun
As this is happening their mother sleeps
Rennyo's stories are like this
He appeals to the people's instincts
They are clever stories
These old folktales remain...
...because they're so powerful
The stories that had no power have long gone
It was a lot of trouble to make this hole
The ADs made it
SATO: Yes, I saw them
SHINDO: That's why they weren't around the set when we were shooting
But I let them know that they were still...
...contributing creatively to the film
Ah, this was the problem cut
JY: I was shocked when I saw the rushes
I asked you to cut it
SHINDO: It was you who decided to strip off
JY: No. I was wearing skin coloured tights...
...and you said they were visible
You were using a telephoto
I didn't know anything about the technical side of things
I assumed you wouldn't see from such a distance...
...so I did it in the nude
When I saw the rushes...
...you could see everything...
...and I asked you to cut it
I can't remember how you responded
I said they wouldn't be able to show that in the cinemas
Then I was suddenly nominated...
...for a Blue Ribbon Award for best supporting actress...
...and I couldn't say anything more
SHINDO: I did cut a little
We started shooting...
...in the morning...
...but it was too muddy to run properly
We laid boards down to cover the mud...
...for you to run on
People were working in mud up to their waists...
...and chests to solve the problem
You were inspired by their selfless efforts...
JY: Really?
SHINDO: So you stripped off
Really? I can't remember it
SHINDO: Really. That was why...
JY: I thought it was because of the tights...
...and because the camera was so far away...
...and you wouldn't see
I thought it was the tights and the camera...
SATO: No. I was right behind you
The camera was over on the left
You were responding to the way people had worked...
...up to their chests in the mud
You were impressed by that
JY: I'd forgotten
SATO: I remember Shindo-san...
...he was calling out to you...
...and you stripped off boldly
We were all impressed
SHINDO: It was hard getting that shot
I thought that shot was going to be easy...
...but it wasn't
We put three layers of board down
The actors waited all morning while we prepared it
There's a sequel to this tale
When we screened the film for Toho...
...Fujimoto cornered me and asked...
...what I was going to do about the censors
I said not to worry...
...but I did end up...
...cutting a little bit
There was never any call for cuts...
...and the few we made settled the matter anyway
We actually got on well and he helped out...
...with the film's distribution
Incidentally, I received the Fujimoto Award yesterday
SATO: Congratulations
SHINDO: I mentioned it because...
...we talked about this story
The story of the pubic hair
JY: Two friends of mine...
...saw the film at the theatre and told me...
...that the scene didn't look at all obscene
I was relieved
They thought it was good
SATO: Some people who saw the film in the theatre...
...said they could see my private parts...
...when I was running
They must have had good eyesight...
I was wearing flesh coloured pants
It's not so easy for a man running naked, is it?
They wouldn't believe me though
When it works well the audience believes it's real
SHINDO: That scene was essential...
...for the overall atmosphere of the film
JY: When I saw it, it wasn't obscene
It was invigorating
SHINDO: That's down to your refreshing personality
JY: Your graciousness
SHINDO: Yes. That's the right expression
SATO: It was about what had been done...
SHINDO: Yes. We'd worked hard from the morning
We'd been laying the boards...
...and that's why you did it
JY: I'd forgotten
So it was that everyone...
...had worked so hard...
...and the fact that you could see the tights as well
SATO: He didn't say anything about tights
He just called out,
'Hey Jitsuko'...
...and you got the message and stripped off
I was only 30cm behind you and I remember it
JY: I thought that it was because...
...you said the tights were visible
SHINDO: Anyway, it was good that you were so brave
It doesn't look at all lewd
JY: It's good that I didn't think too much
It was only my third film...
...and I didn't know anything
In the end, you made it into an invigorating scene
SHINDO: You had youth and vitality
It worked well
JY: I would have been embarrassed if it was in the studio...
...but there was no-one around and the camera was far away
SHINDO: It was a telephoto lens
JY: I didn't know that
I didn't know about the camera
SHINDO: The telephoto was hard to move around
But in the end, it was effective
Everyone did their bit
There's a scene where...
...Nobuko embraces the tree
When I took a train from Abiko on the Narita Line...
...I saw this dead pine tree...
...at the side of the track near one of the stations
I thought it made an impressive sight...
...and decided to bring it to the set
The townspeople were happy to let us take it...
...as it was already dead
The ADs couldn't handle it on their own...
...so the lighting and sound crew helped them...
...to chop it down...
...and to load it onto a lorry and bring it to the set
No-one complained...
...about doing that sort of thing
Everyone mucked in...
...and no-one complained
Felling and transporting trees is a job for a professional
People would have been...
...within their rights to refuse...
...but no-one did
There are good and bad sides to it...
...but this kind of group mentality once existed in the Japanese film world
SHINDO: We had to wait for the sun...
...to set here
You can't do that sort of thing...
...unless you have the time
JY: Nobuko was young then, too
SHINDO: She was full of life, too
It's seven years now since she died
SATO: Yes, it was 1994 wasn't it
I met her at the Tennozu Art Sphere theatre just before she died
They were doing an English play and the director had come over
Nobuko came to see it
Haruko Togo was in the play
Afterwards I thought it was as if...
...she had come to say goodbye...
...because she died right after that
SHINDO: She was relatively fit up until her death
She went to the theatre...
...and to discussion meetings
SATO: It was after Gogo no Yuigonjo, wasn't it?
SHINDO: Yes
JY: She was already sick then, wasn't she?
SHINDO: That's right
She was told she had
18 months to live...
...and she did what work she could during that time
In the end she ran out of strength
She didn't suffer for too long
The doctors are usually right about cancer
It was the same for
Mizoguchi and Ozu
They died when the doctors said they would
SHINDO: You saw where the demon appeared there
The choreography for that scene was arranged by Hideo Kanze
It has the feel of a scene from a Noh play
I wasn't confident about choreographing that scene...
...so I asked Kanze to help
You can hear the intense percussion...
...and the voice yelling
That's Kanze's voice
SATO: Hideo Kanze
And what a voice!
It's astounding
SATO: It would make the window panes vibrate
SHINDO: It's as if a banshee appeared
The cry is drawn out...
...leaving a long trail behind it
SATO: It's a terrifying sound
The rapid beat of the drum...
...and then the voice
Hayashi composed it like that
SHINDO: Shige did the make-up
He was famous
JY: I remember when...
...he went back to Tokyo
His assistant did
Nobuko's eyebrows...
...but she didn't like it
She waited till he came back...
...to make her up before...
...she would do a scene
SHINDO: That's because he...
...because he was a veteran
He made people up based on how they would look on screen...
...not how they looked there and then
You need experience to do that
Mind you, he was a difficult person
He wouldn't do anything, if he didn't feel like it
But we worked together well...
...for a longtime
He would stay on location and make the hair...
...and the beards and everything
He would do things like...
...adding that patch of white...
...to Nobuko's hair
SATO: It's fashionable these days
SHINDO: It wouldn't have been any good...
...if the hair had been completely white
JY: This is before the typhoon, isn't it?
SHINDO: Yes. We were able to shoot the wind as soon as it arrived...
...because we were there
It was the same with the birds
JY: They were ducks and herons, weren't they
SHINDO: If you're not living there...
...you can't film this kind of thing
If you have to travel to the location to catch the typhoon...
...you'll miss it
If you're there, you just film it when it happens
When the wind blew from the south...
...the water level...
...on the north side of the marsh rose by one metre
That's because the sea was to the south
When that happened...
...the prefab...
...we were staying in would often flood
There were lots of crayfish there and they would come...
...into the house when the waters rose
JY: I remember we dug a hole at night...
...and would find crayfish in there in the morning
We'd take them out and fry them
SHINDO: You have to get the mud out of them first
JY: We caught lots
SHINDO: They used to eat crayfish tenpura after the war
SATO: There was an elderly couple...
...who used to go out in a boat on the water...
...they would come back...
...with a bucket full of crayfish
I assumed that they sold them to the local noodle shop
SHINDO: They use them to make soup
When you've rinsed the mud off, they're beautiful
About the time we finished filming...
...lots of tiny little crayfish hatched out
SHINDO: This was hard work
SATO: We couldn't shoot this in the swamp...
...so the ADs had to plant all these reeds
That was quite a job
SHINDO: They were driven to despair at the end
The wind wouldn't blow so we used a large fan
We had to make the wind and make the lightening...
That was tough work
And it was pouring with rain
The field was deep...
...and there were plenty of reeds
SHINDO: What was this fellow's name?
I can't remember it
JY: That was the end of Hachi
SHINDO: They still used this method to make fire...
...in the countryside when I was a boy
When they got cold in the fields...
...they would collect pine needles...
...use flint to light a fire
SHINDO: Do you smoke, Kei?
SATO: Yes
SHINDO, How much?
SATO: About thirty a day
Although I cough at the same time
SHINDO: Do you need to smoke now?
SATO: No, I'm fine
SHINDO: We had two masks made
I went to Kyoto to order them myself
I explained the situation...
...and had them made...
...at a good price...
...because of the film's low budget
JY: It's an excellent mask
It has expression
It has real expression when Nobuko wears it
SHINDO: Hideo Kanze praised it as well
He tried it on one time...
...and performed for us
SATO: Do you still have it?
SHINDO: Yes, I have it at home
The broken one, too
I took it back and had it joined together again
The maker was very attached to it, so he fixed it for me
SATO: This was all post-recorded, wasn't it?
SHINDO: That's right
SATO: The love scenes, too
And the kisses...
My arms were black and blue...
...by the time I'd finished recording
You have to get the timing just right
You said that dubbing the sound would be easier...
...as we could repeat if required
That's not what the actors thought
SHINDO: Well I had to persuade you somehow
I had to get you to do it
It's impossible to synchronize things...
...with the grass swaying and the ground below all muddy
Yes, that's impossible
SATO: It was the same with Ningen
SHINDO: Ningen too, with the sea
It was impossible to synchronize
JY: You remember so much, Kei
You never fail to impress me
SHINDO: The make-up is good here...
...when the mask is stripped off
The skin looks worn
JY: Ah, is that Kanze's voice?
SHINDO: That's right. That's his yell
The point here is that when the film ends we know...
...that Jitsuko leapt across, but we don't know if Nobuko made it...
Nobody knows
JY: So I was the only one left?
SHINDO: That's right
The susukigrass is like having a black background

Crash dive!
Crash dive!

Enough.
- Sighted her, sir!
- I see.
- It's dangerous during the day, sir.
- I imagine so.
Even at night, if it takes too long...
What is it that they want us to take?
A human being, perhaps.
Hitler?
Hardly.
Germany has reached the end of her line.
We'd appreciate it, if it's a powerful secret weapon!
Standing by to take over delivery!
Surface!
Is it so important?
They sent it all the way from Germany and even sacrificed a submarine for it?
HIROSHIMA ARMY HOSPITAL
Salute!
Thank you for your trouble, but I'm afraid you were a bit late.
Why, sir?
I mean we aren't ready, nor do we have the time for further research work.
Here.
The key, sir.
You want to see what is inside, don't you?
Yes, sir.
The thing you risked your life to bring back.
It's Frankenstein's heart.
Frankenstein?
Is it a living heart?
It will never die.
Never die?
Have you ever heard about Frankenstein?
Yes, I have, but not in detail.
A long time ago, a German scientist named Frankenstein sewed up...
...a corpse that had been cut into little pieces...
...and used electric shocks to revive it.
Is this for an important research?
To make soldiers who will never die from getting shot.
Are you trying to pull my leg, Doctor?
I really mean it.
If we could solve the mystery of this heart as well as...
...the activities of the cell bodies...
...80 to 90% of the soldiers who die in wars could be saved.
AUGUST 6TH, 1945
15 YEARS LATER
Take care of yourselves.
I'll come again.
How do you feel?
Please take this, Doctor.
For me?
Yes.
Thank you very much for everything.
It's very beautiful. Thank you.
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.
That's fine.
She knows her end is near.
Perhaps so. She is a bright girl.
Yes.
That's why she hurried to finish this embroidery for you.
Please look, Dr. Bowen.
The cells that have been exposed to twice the lethal dose of radiation have...
...become active.
Did she die?
Tazuko Towoi in Ward No.11...
It's worse than death.
She lingers on, wondering from day to day when she'll die.
It's a shame that our research work...
...hasn't reached the point where we can save her.
Her parents were also killed by the A-bomb, weren't they?
All alone since she was a baby...
How can we describe her life'?
The story of Hiroshima is too tragic.
But it's also a fact that it has given us...
...the opportunity to study the cellular tissues of the human body.
We must work to turn tragedy into eternal peace and happiness in the future.
Did you see a strange-looking boyjust now?
- Yes, he ran in that direction.
- Would you believe it'?
He killed our dog and took it with him.
I think he's going to eat it.
Is he a waif?
There were lots of them just after the war. Please be careful.
- There's no telling what he'll do.
- Yes.
I'm the first!
- Second!
- Third!
What's up?
A rabbit!

Your kimono is very becoming, Doctor.
Thank you.

~ Oh! ay t° Y°u.
Thank you very much. Please come in.
This way, please.
Thank you.
Please sit down.
Thank you.
I'm afraid it's a very modest meal.
Thank you.
It's good, isn't it?
How do you make this soup'?
- First I put dried fish in...
- No...
That's second. First, you scoop up some dried fish.
It takes time to learn to understand American humor.
Japanese humor is very hard to grasp too.
Please.
Thank you.
Are you going to remain in Japan to carry on your research work?
I am afraid not.
But what about your research?
Sueko, I came here after the war, because I was one of the people...
...concerned about the A-bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima.
I wanted to spend my life rehabilitating mankind, not in destroying it.
But...
But?
But the more research work I do, the more I am troubled by doubts.
So I'm thinking of returning to
America to start all over again.
Drop dead!
You're not hurt'?
That boy.
That boy'?
The waif I told you about the other day.
Wait a minute.
Working on Sunday?
Doctor...
They don't have any Sundays either.
Do you remember Tazuko Towoi?
Yes. Today is the anniversary of her death.
Don't squint at bacteria all the time.
How about driving out to visit Tazuko's grave?
Yes, I'd love to.
Thank you, Doctor.
Her grave is up on the mountain in back.
Let's go.
There's a waif!
Come on. Hurry!
Waif?
Let's go.
It's dangerous, Children. Stay away.
Come out!
He's the boy from that night?
I can'tjust shoot him.
Does he really eat dogs and cats?
Yes. Chickens and rabbits too.
He's just like a wild beast himself.
He's gone farther inside.
Go around to the back.
Say, don't try to run away! Come out!
Hurry, come out!
Come out!
No use trying to get away!
Come out!
We'll bring him out, so please send everyone away.
- No, it's dangerous.
- I've fed him once.
Too many will only upset him.
Leave us alone.
Please be careful then.
Come out.
There's nothing to worry about. Come out.
Come out. No one will hurt you.
Please don't use a flash.
We don't want him to go on a rampage.
Drink this.
Strange to say, this boy's a Caucasian.
- A half-caste abandoned by a prostitute?
- No, he is a full-blooded white boy.
He received radiation when he was a baby.
And the important point is that he did not develop radiation poisoning.
Instead, his body is building up strong resistance to radiation.
Radiation?
I can't believe a white boy was abandoned just after the end of the war.
Wasn't he born much later than that?
In any case, he's very important from a scientific point of view.
I'd like your help in finding out who his parents are, where he was born...
...and in what sort of environment he grew up.
AKITA OIL FIELDS
It says there's a boy in Hiroshima who shows a strong resistance to radiation.
VICTIM OF A-BOMB? A WAIF HAVING
STRONG RESISTANCE TO RADIATION
Hundreds of thousands of people were killed.
I wouldn't be surprised if a child like that was born.
You said you saw a heart in Hiroshima that will never stop beating, didn't you?
Yes.
It's a silly story.
So many peculiar things happened around the time the war ended.
An earthquake?
It seems like a big one.
Run for it!
Run!
Run to the mountain in back!
Hurry! Run!
Are you all right?
Hurry!
He doesn't show any signs of recognizing words.
He has strange blue eyes.
Could it be caused by anemia?
No.
Why are you so violent?
Eat quietly.
Miss Togami.
He won't harm me.
Now, sit down.
Anyway, we'd better put him in a cage or chain him...
He grows with amazing speed. ls it due to radiation?
If we only knew that, we could say we'd half succeeded in our research work.
As far as we know, radiation is detrimental to human beings.
I'm back.
How was it?
There were four hundred letters, including those sent to newspapers...
...and TV stations.
I went through all of them, but none were of any help.
I see.
However, one of the letters says he may be the boy that used to be...
...seen playing in the ruins of the Army Hospital.
- At the Army Hospital?
- Yes.
I went to see the sender, but I couldn't find out anything about his parents...
...just that he'd been seen playing in the ruins.
- Alone?
- Yes, always alone.
But even if the story is true...
...how could he have grown up there from the time he was a helpless baby...
...if he were all alone?
He has become so big we had to put him in here.
He still grows like a baby.
Why is that?
We don't know.
- Is he ever violent?
- No, he isn't.
It'sjust a precautionary measure.
I'd like to go in and take some pictures.
Please do.
Is it safe'?
Yes, while I am with him.
Wait a minute. I'll bring you something to eat right away.
We don't know when he will become violent.
We can't keep him here any longer.
We've decided to build a place for him with the laboratory budget.
So only until it is completed...
- I'm afraid I can't give you an answer alone.
- What do you suggest then?
How about asking the Zoo to keep him?
He's a human being!
He's precious. There's no one like him in the whole world.
Dr. Kawaji and Dr. Togami, please return to the laboratory at once!
I don't know if I'll be of any help or not, but...
I couldn't forget the news of the boy who had grown up in the...
...ruins of the Army Hospital.
Just after Berlin fell, we received
Frankenstein's heart from a German submarine...
...and delivered it to the
Army Hospital in Hiroshima.
I heard then that the heart would never die.
Did you see it?
Yes.
Was it alive'?
Yes.
It was preserved in liquid.
It was beating regularly.
But how the heart...
Why did they bring it to Japan?
I was told that they'd make soldiers who'd recover instantly from bullet wounds.
It was a study on the activities of the cell bodies that...
...would never die as long as you replenish protein to them.
Let's find the scientists in Germany who were involved in this at that time.
FRANKFURT, GERMANY
What you would like to know is...
...whether the creature in Hiroshima is Frankenstein or not, isn't it'?
Yes, sir.
Dr. Frankenstein's monster that you are talking about...
It is said the monster died many times, but always came back to life.
However, its heart has never died.
Not even once.
If the protein supply is sufficient, the active cells will quickly mend the body.
Even if the arms are cut off, new ones will grow on again.
When you return to Japan, cut off his arm or leg.
If he is Frankenstein, he will grow new ones.
Moreover, I'm sure the arms or legs that have been cut off will also live on.
Here's your food.
Doesn't it hurt'?
But it's eating into your wrist.
I'll order a larger chain at once.
You must be tired.
Is anything wrong?
It's nothing.
Let's ask Sueko's opinion too.
Dr. Togami's certain to oppose it.
What are you two talking about?
I met Dr. Rissendorf in Frankfurt.
He said that...
...the only way to prove whether he's
Frankenstein or not is to cut off...
...his arm and leg.
If a new arm or leg grows in again, he's Frankenstein without a doubt.
I'm absolutely against such a cruel thing!
There's no other way to find out.
What if no new arm or leg grows back on?
He's not a human being anyway.
You refused to let him be sent to a zoo by insisting he's a human, didn't you?
But just as gorillas aren't human beings, right now he's...
N0! He's a human being.
So was Frankenstein.
He wasn't an ordinary human being.
- He was man-made.
- Even so, a human beingjust the same!
Let's think it over carefully. lt would be terrible if we made a mistake.
It's good.
Thank you. Thank you.
I cook mine too long.
It's simple. First, be sure to get good meat.
No, that's second.
First, you lasso a big cow, don't you?
Dr. Kawaji's late, isn't he?
He said he had some work left, but I'm sure he'll be here soon.
Say, be careful! Steps here!
Camera here!
- Listen, who's in charge here? Are you?
- We're from a TV station.
The hospital official gave us the go-ahead to take pictures.
It's okay to take pictures.
But he's really in a bad humor although he seems quiet enough.
I wish he'd cut up a little.
He's not worth filming as he is now.
It's no joke.
Ready?
Lights okay.
- Ready! Start shooting!
- Stop!
- Stop it! Stop, I tell you!
- Please don't come out!
Is it safe'?
Turn off the lights! Turn them off!
- Lights off!
- Amazing.
Run! Run!
The monster's become loose!
The phone!
Call the police!
Hello!
Hello! Get me the hospital official!
The hospital official, please!
Hospital official? ls anything wrong with the Boy?
He's cut his chain and has become loose! ls Dr. Bowen there?
Yes, he is.
- Please ask him to come over at once!
- Yes!
I'll go too.
No, it's dangerous!
The boy will listen to me. He needs me.
He's no longer a boy.
We're in terrible trouble.
What can we do?
Gather all the fire extinguishers!
We'll blind him! And get ropes!
Bring all the fire extinguishers!
Hurry, hurry!
It's dangerous! Don't go too near!
Go!
Don't kill him!
Don't kill him!
At 7:30 tonight, the giant that was being kept at the laboratory of the International...
Institute of Radiotherapeutics became wild and has suddenly disappeared.
Emergency orders have been issued.
AII the police force and firemen are requested to return to their positions...
and wait for further orders.
I will repeat...
What is it?
Wait!
You can't escape!
Wait!
Come back!
Over there! Over there!
Regardless of all the sacrifices, you believe that he shouldn't be killed?
Yes!
He is very important scientifically!
It is not for us to decide whether he should be killed or not.
But as scientists, we can only say we hope that he will not be killed.
- Weren't those deaths due to negligence?
- Yes.
The problem is what sort of chain was used on him.
Let's check and see!
It's very strange.
Was the handcuff too big?
That's it! It must have slipped off.
They should be held responsible for it then.
I don't see anything.
It was here! I'm sure it was!
It's strange!
Doctor, it's Frankenstein!
There's no doubt about it!
Frankenstein, did you say?
The movement seems to have become slower.
Yes.
I'll make the protein culture solution at once. We must keep the hand alive.
What a surprise!
Now, we can't shoot him, can we?
- Are you going to kill him'?
- ls there any other way of killing him?
I don't think he'll offer any resistance if I go.
Can you stay with him 24 hours every day all year round?
Hello.
For you.
Thank you.
Hello.
There was trouble at a hog ranch in Okayama!
What about it?
A hog ranch! Five hogs were killed!
Are you telling me that
Frankenstein went to Okayama?
What else can we think?
Ate everything except the bone and skin!
All right! I'll be right back!
He's escaped to Okayama!
It's out of our hands then, sir?
Don't look so relieved yet.
OKAYAMA
An emergency announcement!
An emergency announcement!
It has been confirmed that Frankenstein is somewhere in the vicinity...
of Okayama City.
According to the Hiroshima Police...
he hunts for food mostly during the night...
and remains in the mountains and valleys during the daytime.
Anyone who sees him, please report it...
to the nearest police station or to the city office.
Be sure to listen in on all news about him from now on.
Eyewitnesses say that he is four times bigger than a human being.
He's grown bigger since he left Hiroshima.
He's so big and you haven't found him yet?
Our patrol cars are of no use.
And he can think like a human being which makes it even worse.
Yes.
What I would like to say, sir, is that he's always a jump ahead of us.
What do you want me to do?
We need tanks more than patrol cars.
That's being considered already at a higher level.
- Will they be in time for tonight?
- You're...
It's imperative that we take every precaution tonight.
- Okay.
- Yes.
- A success, isn't it?
- Yes, it's a success!
Has it been revived?
Look closely, the nails seem to have grown longer too.
The hand will be able to remain active now...
...without the aid of the electro-magnetic device, won't it?
It only needs nourishment now.
HIMEJI CASTLE
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
This place is right in the middle of the city, so I guess he wouldn't come here.
I guess not, but I'd like to get a look at him if he's so big.
Scared, but you want to see him?
Help!
OSAKA
OSAKA POLICE HEADQUARTERS
Yes?
Oh, they are here.
- Hello.
- Thank you for coming. Hello.
How do you do?
We're sorry to trouble you, but we decided to request your presence...
...in case something completely unexpected came up.
Please sit down.
Thank you.
I hope we can help you.
Do you think Frankenstein has any purpose in coming to Kyoto, Osaka, or Kobe?
Not particularly, since he does not know the cities you mentioned.
You insisted at first, did you not, on not having him killed?
As a scientist, I still do.
But as you know, we have preserved his hand...
...so if you decide that he must be killed after all the harm he has done...
...we will bow to the inevitable...
...and will not try to prevent it.
Hello.
What? Lake Biwa'?
Something 500 meters ahead!
- Slow speed ahead!
- Slow speed ahead!
- Hard starboard 15°.
- Hard starboard 15°.
Captain!
Calm down! Calm down!
There's nothing we can do but go home.
He's right.
But we have his hand.
We can still continue our studies with it.
HATO
- ls anything wrong?
- Yes...
The hand's gone!
What?
When'? When did it happen?
I noticed it when I came to work this morning.
There's not a single drop of fluid left...
Look for it again, all of you! Hurry!
Dr. Bowen!
Find it?
It's dead!
But it's grown very large!
We made a great mistake. The larger it became, the more protein it needed.
MT. IBUKI
HEIKE-DAKE
DAINICHI-DAKE
SHIRAKA WA VILLAGE
- Thank you for coming.
- Glad to be of help.
Where did you see him?
This morning at the w00dcutter's hut.
It was destroyed by a big log that flew through the air, they say.
How about the village?
Nothing seems to be wrong there.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, sir!
It's a boar!
Is it cold in the Japanese Alps?
Yes.
People can ski in the snow valleys there even in summer.
He instinctively seeks a climate like that of Frankfurt.
That is, a cold place.
I imagine the coolness of the
Japanese Alps has pleased him.
Yes, Frankfurt's situated in latitude 50°N.
Why did he return to the warm lowlands again then'?
There isn't enough food containing protein in the mountains.
He moves along the railroad tracks because there are towns and villages...
...where he can get food easily.
Poor thing, he'll be hunted down and killed in the end, won't he?
No, he must not be killed!
- But...
- We must appeal...
...to the scientific world and to the public and save him.
When he reaches a place that satisfies him...
...we must give him food, so that he will settle there.
I believe he will stop next at some place half-way up Mt. Fuji.
SHIRANE HUTS
Let's dance.
Yes.
What's the matter?
Did you hear anythingjust now?
No.
Don't worry. Don't worry.
This is terrible.
Why is it that there's no one around not even the employees working here?
We can only think that
Frankenstein became violent again.
Please.
Thanks.
Are you still of the opinion that
Frankenstein must be protected and kept alive'?
We are not certain yet whether he caused all that destruction or not.
- You don't think he did it?
- No.
Judging from his former movements,
Mt. Shirane is too far away for him.
He was seen to the north of Shizuoka last, so...
...if he's been moving he would be somewhere near the foothills of Mt. Fuji now.
He hasn't harmed anyone of his own accord even once.
- Are you of the same opinion, Doctor?
- Yes, I am.
N0 one has seen
Frankenstein at Mt. Shirane.
Everyone that saw him was killed.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
It's hard to make them believe us, isn't it?
I wonder.
A cave-in!
This is terrible!
Shimamoto!
- Mr. Kaneshima!
- Miyaguchi!
Let's
Are you all right?
- Done for.
- What?
Let's go in.
Wait. It's dangerous if it's filled with poisonous gasses.
Oh! What's that?
It's moving!
It's moving!
It's an animal!
The food that we threw down yesterday hasn't been touched.
It wasn't him at the
Shimizu tunnel, was it?
Frankenstein doesn't eat people.
I know he's around here somewhere.
Our home's smashed to pieces!
Mother!
Daddy!
Mommy said she'd be at the south quarry today.
Yes.
Mother!
Daddy!
Advance!
This place was used as a powder magazine during the war.
It's over a mile long in there.
We'd like to go in too.
Well, if you do, please be very careful.
Yes.
Standing by!
All right!
We're all ready, sir!
All right!
There he is! Fire!
Did they find him?
Fire!
Stop firing!
It will only make him angry!
Go back! Go back!
Get back!
Stop it! Get back!
Retreat! Retreat!
- Get back!
- Hurry!
Hurry, Sueko! Hurry!
Hurry! Run!
Help!
Cease firing!
It was Frankenstein after all, wasn't it, at Shimizu tunnel?
So it seems.
We can't possibly keep him alive now.
No...
Shall we leave the rest to the authorities and leave?
I wish we could have a finger of his.
Yes?
- Why, Mr. Kawai.
- It's been a while.
Please come in.
Excuse me.
I saw the papers and came.
- All the way from Akita?
- Yes.
Please sit down.
Thank you for coming.
There's something
I would like to tell you.
I believe there's another monster beside
Frankenstein that's doing all that harm.
WhY d0 you say that?
These newspaper clippings of the Shimizu tunnel...
...and village cases mention that a strange light went on and off.
Which part of Frankenstein's body glows like that? His eyes?
No, they don't glow.
Then what is it that glows?
There's a reason for my believing it to be different from Frankenstein.
During the earthquake in Akita, I saw a mysterious light that went on and off.
It happened during the blackout.
I think the light came from a very low position.
I told myself that the violent earthquake...
...had upset me so much that it had made me imagine things.
Frankenstein walks on land, so how could he travel...
...from Shirane to Mt. Fuji without being seen by a single person?
However, this monster can travel underground.
Doctor!
Frankenstein must not be killed!
Would you tell your story to all the newspapers?
Yes.
It burrows underground, so it dislikes the rays of the sun.
It did appear in the daytime at a quarry in Shizuoka...
...but that was probably due to the thick fog.
- Like a ninja, huh'?
- What?
It's nothing.
If we only had a picture of the monster or something, we could write it up.
But I'm afraid just your words haven't enough news value.
Some deep-sea fish are bioluminescent.
Yes.
This monster lives underground all year round, so...
It wouldn't be strange if it is bioluminescent.
However, when it comes to burrowing itself beneath the ground...
...it is so huge that it's quite a difficult thing to do.
The way I look at it is like this...
In the Mesozoic Age, mammoth reptiles vanished from the earth...
...because the earth's surface cooled off. Am I correct?
Yes.
Some of them escaped to the deep underground and may have...
...continued to multiply and lived until today.
I won't say it is impossible to happen...
...but I can't agree with you either...
...since such a thing is highly improbable.
No one would believe my story.
They all treated me like a mad man.
We're very grateful to you.
Thank you for coming all this way.
N0, yours is the hard work.
I hope you find Frankenstein very soon and save him.
- Please.
- Thanks.
The best of luck.
Good bye.
When I have enough time and money, I'll come again.
Good bye.
I'm afraid we're running out of time and money too.
Did the hospital in Hiroshima send word'?
They said to drop this futile search and return to work.
We can't depend on the scientific world to help us any more either.
How about money'?
The hotel will wait for payment, but...
...it costs so much to hire the helicopter every day.
Come on...
Yesterday's food is all gone!
Throw more down in the same place!
0K3)'-
Circle the place once more!
Do you think he remembers me'?
- I'm not sure.
- We can't decide anything now.
The thing is to find and take care of him somehow.
Boy!
This way.
My compass doesn't work.
Let's go on anyway.
Yes.
The weather has become very bad.
It's impossible to find him, isn't it?
Yes.
It's not safe. Let's come again.
Please go ahead.
Dr. Kawaji!
- I'm quite safe alone.
- N0, Dr. Kawaji!
Dr. Bowen!
Even if Frankenstein remembers
Dr. Togami, we don't know...
...if she can tame him now.
I agree with the public opinion that says to kill him!
But all our hard work up to now would g0 to waste if he were shot to pieces.
I'd like his heart intact, and some of his flesh too.
It would be easier for us to take care of it.
But you can't do it alone!
I think he is most vulnerable...
...here, his eyes.
I brought something to blind him.
If he's blind, he will be in my hands.
That's crueler than killing him outright!
He's doomed to be killed anyway.
If we can keep his heart intact...
...it's the only way to save
Frankenstein's life, don't you see?
I don't know how you intend to do it, but if you fail...
...and anger him, it will be very dangerous.
We'll never be able to get near him again.
I can't fail.
Stay back!
The underground monster!
Hurry! Run!
Sueko!
Sueko!
Sueko!
Sueko!
Sueko!
Dr. Bowen!
Dr. Togami!
Dr. Bowen!
Dr. Togami!
Frankenstein!
Dr. Kawaji!
Dr. Kawaji! Dr. Kawaji!
Are you all right?
Hurry!
Watch where you go...
Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry! Hurry!
- Is there a first aid kit?
- Yes.
- Baragon's about 2 miles from here.
- ls that true?
Head for the hills! Head for the hills!
Head for the hills!
Head for the hills! Hurry!
Watch your feet!
Watch where you walk.
- Are you all right now'?
- Yes.
That monster dives underground so fast.
Frankenstein's no match for him.
As Mr. Kawai said, the oil fields, hot springs and volcanoes...
...may have something to do with underground passages.
The deepest place under the earth... we don't know so many things about it.
The forest is burning!
You're all safe?
Yes, there's another monster beside Frankenstein!
What?
- Are all the men in their positions?
- Yes, sir!
- Report the current status!
- Yes, sir!
What's that?
That's a giant octopus!
- Isn't the main force here yet?
- Orderly, step out!
Move Platoon 5!
Yes, sir!
- Move Platoon 1 to Area A!
- Yes, sir!
He'll lose! He can't win!
That octopus!
Did Frankenstein die?
N0, Frankenstein will never die.
I think he'll return again somewhere, sometime.
Perhaps, the best thing would be for him to die. After all, he's only a monster.
All platoons clear out!
Clear out!
Clear out!
Clear out!
THE END
Your husband was a wonderful man.
Death is very sad.
Sad?
Mr. Bentley.
I'm very pleased to see you.
Thank you very much.
Will you have tea. or would you prefer a drink?
I really haven't time.
It won't take any time at all if you have your refreshments while we conduct our business.
Tea will be fine.
- I'll pour. Albert.
- Yes. Miss Marrable.
I ordered tea brewed because
I was expecting Mr. Honigger.
Avid tea drinker.
But I suppose the reading of the will is usually left to the junior partner.
Will you have cream.
Mr. Bentley. or brandy?
Brandy lends an elegance to tea.
Neither. thank you. and no sugar.
The actual reading is a formality we can dispense with. and I can give you the salient points.
After all. you're the only person mentioned in the will.
Well. I shouldn't be surprised to find that Joseph had left me everything.
After all. there's no one else he could've possibly included.
Will you have a piece of hazelnut cake?
No. no. thank you.
Of course. I'll depend on you to fill me in on the details of Joseph's enterprises.
I suppose they're terribly involved.
Actually not that much.
To sum up. Mrs. Marrable. your husband was not as solvent as you probably assume.
You must be referring to that dilapidated apartment house he bought.
Joseph mentioned that that turned out to be an unprofitable venture.
Yes. He disposed of that some time ago.
Oh. did he?
Well. he wasn't always able to keep me up on all his ventures.
His oil holdings. though. must be doing very well.
His oil holdings are unexercised options.
They must have some value.
Well. Joseph invested in so many companies.
They're so numerous. I can't even remember all the names!
Mrs. Marrable. there are no assets. only liabilities.
Surely you know your husband borrowed the money to pay the surgeon for the last two operations. and the hospital bill has yet to be settled.
You are overlooking the insurance. which amounted to 200.000 before he increased it!
He cashed out all his policies.
Well. certainly there's the house... with the furniture and the rugs.
How many of these pieces have been in Joseph's family for generations?
They don't belong to me either.
I'm afraid not.
I have the documents here.
Of course. Mr. Marrable bequeathed his personal possessions to you. including his watch. his gold cufflinks. his briefcase with all its contents.
He lost his cufflinks!
The watch disappeared between trips to the hospital!
But I have his rusty dagger... his stamp album that he hasn't looked at in years... and his boyhood butterfly collection.
All this is mine. is it. to keep?
Plus the shirt on my back.
I suppose!
What am I going to do?
You must have relatives.
No. I have a nephew in Arizona... or is it New Mexico?... but I haven't laid eyes on him since he was a child.
I have no one.
I'm sorry. but I'll need your signature on these...
Nothing. Nothing.
Mr. Bentley. all I have left is my personal savings account.
That ought to help.
To live on for the rest of my life?
It's something to keep you going for a while.
It won't last any time at all. and you know that. and Joseph Marrable knew that.
How am I to live?
I'll need your signature.
What am I going to live on?
What shall I do?
What shall I do?
Your signature.
Mrs. Marrable.
I'll take the flashlight.
Do we have to do it now?
Oh. yes. The soil's too dry in the daytime. and the hot sun can burn the roots.
Pick that up. will you?
Miss Tinsley.
Miss Tinsley. will you fetch the mail?
Here's that sample of tea you sent for.
Want it for your lunch?
There'll be plenty of time to taste it.
Just store it for the present. naturally without opening the lid.
Hindus have taken great pains to teach us that tea loses its aroma unless properly sealed.
Oh. well.
That's flattering.
I have been invited to join the museum building committee.
Lunch is almost ready.
I have to talk to Juan first.
Has he made one of his usual blunders?
I'll never know why you put up with him.
Miss Tinsley.
Oh. do remember to leave ample room for the roots.
My gardening magazine says it never hurts to make the hole too deep.
I make it good.
But when they bring the tree?
Well. the nursery delivers in the late afternoon. but as you know.
I like to attend to it myself.
You have a very green thumb.
Yes.
Your pine trees grow good.
Very good.
Don't spill it.
Obviously you haven't the remotest idea how much a bottle of Grand Marnier is worth. or you'd be more watchful of every drop.
You've never tasted it. have you?
No.
I'm afraid
I don't care for liquor.
When referring to a cordial. we use the French pronunciation... liqueur. Miss Tinsley.
I shouldn't try to teach you any more. considering how little you've absorbed under my tutelage.
Will you turn that off. please?
It's one of your favorites.
Is it indeed?
I believe we can do without music this evening.
May I see the financial page?
You may.
What do you expect to find there?
Your stocks are unlisted. as they were the day you placed your order.
But how are they doing?
Are they going up. or are they going down?
How would I know?
Well. I thought your broker would keep you advised.
He has more pressing business than to render daily quotations of your gigantic investment.
I know it doesn't seem much to you. but it represents my savings. practically all of it.
It was at your request. my dear Miss Tinsley. that I handed your massive capital over to my broker.
Well. yes. When you told me your stock had doubled and was still going up. I...
You wanted to hitch onto a star without any awareness of how treacherously it can become a falling comet.
However... no more of this.
I'll call my broker in the morning and instruct him to sell your securities. at a loss if need be.
Oh. no.
I can't afford that.
No. I don't want to sell now.
Don't call him. Mrs. Marrable. not on my account. Please.
I won't. if you'll kindly stop wringing your hands over your money.
I think I'll go to my room.
Good night.
You promised to help me plant my pine tree.
You want to do it now?
Go on. I'll join you in the garden in a moment.
This would be much easier in the light of day.
Well. the soil's too dry in the daytime.
Besides. hot sun can burn the roots.
I think this hole's too big for that little tree.
Oh. I don't think so.
Oh. what a nuisance.
My watch dropped off.
- I don't see it.
- It's over there.
Down there.
Look at Aunt Claire charming the men.
Who wouldn't. with that fabulous necklace you and George gave her?
I wouldn't have my own mother to a cocktail party.
Elva. George and I are very fond of Aunt Claire.
We know. dear. That's why you asked her to come live in Arizona.
She's got so much money that somebody has to keep an eye over.
You aid and abet them.
Well. Aunt Claire believes in the underdog. don't you?
Wait till the underdog starts building across the road from you.
If the Indians are rich enough to build there.
George won't mind a bit.
That's the measure of aristocracy nowadays. isn't it. George?
It isn't every day I can get away from my dull husband for a matinee.
I went there. my darling.
I waited over half an hour.
You should never miss an appointment with me. oao o oo g vo o oo a o
Pity. too.
You've escaped.
What's wrong with our party?
Nothing. It's lovely.
Maybe I've been to too many in the East.
And this is the reason I came to Arizona.
The rocks or the snakes?
The open spaces.
No kidding.
Well. there's a lot more desert out there.
I could take you for a drive.
They won't miss us.
Least of all my wife.
No. thank you. I'd like to take my time discovering the desert.
I confess that's what I had in mind.
On my own.
Your brother-in-law asked us to look out for you.
He went too far.
The whole family did.
They wanted to be nice to the widow.
And so do you?
Harriet. I'm sorry your husband was killed.
I...
Let's go. huh?
Well. well. well.
Mrs. Vaughn. I don't believe you've met George's aunt. Mrs. Marrable.
Mrs. Vaughn's brother-in-law is a stockbroker. too. in the East.
I hope he gives better advice than George.
Those stocks I bought for you went up. Aunt Claire.
Up and down. up and down.
Never enough to matter.
I should be going.
It's nice to meet you.
Mrs. Marrable.
I'd completely forgotten you had a child to take care of.
I'm so glad you had time for a breather.
Bye-bye.
Can I get you another drink. Aunt Claire?
No. I have to steer this vehicle of mine.
I hope you find a new housekeeper soon.
It's a pity you had to fire Miss Tinsley.
She was the nicest one you ever had.
You know. I still can't picture her drunk.
Oh. she was though. horribly.
Otherwise I wouldn't have discharged her.
The help problem is getting absolutely impossible.
I hope you didn't give
Miss Tinsley any references.
She knew better than to ask for them.
You've had such rotten luck with your housekeepers. Aunt Claire.
Have I?
Actually. I think
I've done rather well.
What makes this valley so rip-humming popular?
Prettiest part of the county. but it is kinda remote.
Well. there's one neighbor.
No one's lived there for some time now.
I gave up nursing on marrying a doctor. but when he left me... by dying... a few years ago.
I took it up again.
Of course. my knowledge was pretty dated to return to full-fledged nursing. so I became a sort of combination housekeeper/nurse/companion.
Have you any references?
Three. I-I had four positions. but one of my people died... quiet. natural death at age 95. and I haven't been able to reach her son.
You mustn't be misled by my confinement to this chair.
It's purely temporary. and I shan't require any nursing. however adept you may be in that field.
Well. you don't object to it as a bonus. I hope.
I can cook a grand meal... everything from buttermilk pancakes to a very good beef bourguignonne.
I've always kept a neat house.
I assume there's an underlying reason for your desire to offer your services.
What is it?
In other words. why do I want to work?
Well. I applied for the job. so I guess I want it.
Do you require better reasons than that?
My dear woman. you don't expect me to buy a pig in a poke. do you?
Well. uh...
I want to work because...
I don't think anyone should be idle.
It's bad for your morale.
Besides. I don't like to live by myself.
I can't come up with more reasons. but I'll keep trying.
I know it isn't easy to pick one out of all the people who answer your ad.
I assure you not every applicant who contacts me by phone is invited to appear in person.
Should I. however. decide on you. the terms must be quite clear.
I provide room and board and the stipend indicated in my advertisement.
There are to be no increases.
Well. the salary's very satisfactory. or I wouldn't have come out here.
Well. it wouldn't allow you to save much. and I would like to know that you're covered in case of illness.
Oh. I do have savings of my own.
You don't drink. do you?
Why are you hesitating?
Well. I'd hate to miss out on the job because I enjoy an occasional glass of sherry.
Well... one more thing.
I've had abominable luck with housekeepers who went dashing off to family weddings and to nurse ailing grandchildren.
But who would I dash off to?
I have nobody... nobody in the entire world.
Mrs. Dimmock...
I hope you will be very happy here.
Well.
Before you leave. would you transplant the geranium?
Mrs. Dimmock.
Yes?
Bring me that new pamphlet on deep rooting. will you?
In a minute.
It's in the library with the government publications.
It came yesterday.
Can't you find it?
I have it.
I don't consider that broadminded.
Well. I think you're a saint.
Stuck with that brat for months.
How can you stand it?
Don't you think your husband's family took advantage of you?
Nope. I volunteered.
Gave me a chance to get away from the relatives. both Ken's and mine... and from the small talk. gossip. pressures.
To become one with nature.
M ao
Does. um...
Does that apply to men. too?
I'm sorry.
I suppose it's too soon.
Don't be sorry.
It's a good question.
I just don't have the answer.
Well. you couldn't have come to a better place if you want a good roll in the hay.
Help yourself.
- Even with George.
- No. thank you.
I think you're the kind that plays for keeps.
- If that's your...
- Excuse me.
M ao
Yes.
I knew I couldn't be wrong. but I can't pinpoint where we met.
M ao o avo
We must've.
I knew your name.
Mine's Mike Darrah.
Mind if I sit down?
Please. You don't mind?
No.
Have you also met
Mrs. Vaughn somewhere?
No. I haven't.
You don't live in Tucson.
No. I'm from Phoenix.
I'm only here for the day to see a customer.
Let's see who can tell what Mr. Darrah sells.
I say... real estate.
Your guess?
Mrs. Vaughn doesn't play games.
So says my husband.
Some games I do.
I don't know what you sell. but some of your work is done with your hands.
Hey. you're warm.
I take your ordinary automobile and I turn it into a snappy racing car.
- You go to the racetrack?
- Yes.
She's here taking care of a sick nephew.
The poor little thing has asthma and takes up all of her time.
He is improving.
Well. you told me...
No boy of ten years old likes to be cooped up in a hotel. especially when he's been promised a great adventure in the West.
Look. I know this isn't exactly typical of the West. but I bet he likes fast cars.
He wouldn't be the only one.
I'd love to see what a souped-up motor would do for my car.
I'll be glad to demonstrate.
Well. it's been very nice seeing you again.
- Please call us.
- I will.
Let me take care of the check.
Well. thank you.
I'll call you the next time
I'm in the village.
To demonstrate my engine.
Well. bye. you two.
What's the matter?
I was ready to laugh.
Why don't you pour yourself one. too?
M a
Please do.
Lovely.
Take a look at my calendar.
What do I have to do this afternoon?
Well. you have a note here
I can't make out.
Oh. I have to write to my broker in Chicago.
He's a marvelous man of the old school.
He's not much given to correspondence. but he has yet to be wrong about a stock.
But your nephew is a stockbroker?
Oh. nothing like my man in Chicago.
He's a delight.
He's made a fortune for me.
Sure.
You wouldn't know the word for parrot fever. would you?
Psittacosis.
How marvelous to have an encyclopedic knowledge.
You wouldn't know how to spell it. would you?
P-S-l-T-T-A...
Whose dog is that?
Chloe!
Get away from there!
Don't you hurt that dog!
Who are you?
James Vaughn. and where's your property line?
Jim!
Oh. I'm awfully sorry.
Jim's been reading about all the lands the Indians had. and he...
We moved into the cottage for three months.
I don't think you remember me.
We met at the Lawsons'.
My name is Harriet Vaughn.
I was not informed that the cottage was available for renting.
Ask her if Chloe belongs to her.
Chloe?
Well. that's what she called the dog.
Chloe is a tramp.
Then we can keep her. Harriet.
You will do nothing of the kind. and if the dog is so misfortunate as to appear again. you will not encourage her to stay.
I hope that wasn't an order. Mrs. Marrable.
If you don't want the dog around. we'll work it out. but...
I have not taken loving and diligent care of my garden to have it wrecked by this vagrant bitch.
Neighbors don't always warm up to each other right away.
Mrs. Marrable hasn't had any for years.
Can we keep the dog?
Keep the dog out of this garden or we'll have the sheriff after us.
She doesn't even know what kind of dog it is... you know. male or female.
Rose Hull was forever petting and feeding Chloe.
Rose...?
Hull. She used to live in that cottage before she became my housekeeper.
It's a wonder she didn't take her dog with her.
It wasn't her dog!
I have told you. Chloe is a tramp.
At least she was clever enough not to come around after Rose Hull left.
Well. did Rose Hull...
George. someone has moved into the cottage.
You had a chance to buy that cottage when Rose Hull stopped making payments.
Tle bark owrs it row.
Well. I had no idea anyone would want to live there.
I must have my privacy. George.
Use your friends at the bank. can't you?
Didn't you tell me you're one big club. one for all and all for nobody?
Come here. Let's go.
Come on.
Hello.
Hi.
...explain myself.
I'm entering the same contest as Mrs. Marrable.
I can't let her know... she wouldn't like that at all... so I was mailing my card from your box.
A blank card is all that they ask for.
The first hundred entries get a portable makeup mirror that lights up all over.
How will they know where to send it?
There's no return address.
Am I getting absent-minded!
Oh. dear.
May I have my mail. please?
That is. unless our captivating neighbor requires you further.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were up and about.
She seems to be a pleasant young lady.
Would you prefer to be in her employ?
I was just being friendly. that's all.
Oh. I'm convinced of it.
Soap manufacturers put more scent in their samples than they do in the product they sell.
Put that in the closet. will you?
We have so much stored up in there. we could open up shop.
Are you suggesting that I give it away to your newly acquired friend across the way?
I won! I won!
I am the winner of the...
Well... it's only the third prize.
Nevertheless. feast your eyes on that.
$25! What was the contest?
In 50 words or less.
I gave an inspired account of how I allured my most recent boyfriend!
I am going to proceed to enter every teenage contest in the country.
I didn't expect...
I should have told the mailman there's no one here by that name.
Post offices have been known to make mistakes before.
It's not a serious one.
This was her address at one time.
Your breakfast is ready.
Thank you.
How long are you gonna stay?
Certainly another couple of months.
We took a lease on the cottage.
But you know that.
Are you happy with the place?
Great for Jim. Me too.
I'm so glad you told me about it.
I'm sure the lease can be extended.
Oh. I might stay longer.
I just might.
Look what I have for you.
Come on.
Come on. Chloe.
Come on.
Come on. Chloe.
Delicious!
Come. come.
Come and get it.
Come on.
Chloe. are you coming?
Come on. Chloe.
Come and get it.
Come on. come on.
Are you coming?
That's a good dog.
Are you aware that the cocktail hour has come and gone?
Has it? I have your margarita right here.
I'm a bit slow today. Haven't had much experience with pheasant.
When I engaged you. you led me to assume that you were a highly proficient cook who wouldn't be thrown off schedule by a new variety of fowl.
I'm only running a few minutes late.
Punctuality is essential to a gracious way of life. which I do not intend to give up on account of you.
Well. I've been trying to prepare a lovely meal. and that cannot be done with all the complaints and interruptions... a o o o a o o vo o
I would like to be heard for once.
If you want to live like some duchess or maharani. you better learn to behave like one!
I must have known this would be my reward for being far more considerate and patient and generous to you than I have been to any of my former housekeepers.
And how long did they stay with you?
Not one of them walked out on me.
Are you threatening to?
Well?
Are you?
No.
No. I wasn't threatening to walk out. no.
I wouldn't blame you if you fired me on the spot.
Oh. well...
I must admit that I was tempted to. but I soon realized that what at first seemed disrespect. if not mutiny. was simply an uncontrollable outburst of temper.
My temper will do me in.
Oh! I've been told and told.
If I keep on flying off the handle.
I'll have no friends left.
Well. I've been so disgusted with the procession of humdrum. mealy-mouthed yes ladies who have paraded through this house that a touch of fire is a welcome change.
I've been wondering about those others.
We nurses tend to do that.
If you learn where your predecessor fell short. you're less likely to make the same mistakes.
There's no danger.
Miss Tinsley was a tedious woman. endowed with an astonishing lack of taste.
Is that why you got rid of her?
No. No. it was... it was her devotion to alcohol which brought about the parting of our ways.
You mean she drank a whole lot?
Well. I wouldn't have made an issue of an occasional highball.
What I had to go through to cleanse her room of that pervasive odor of gin.
And once she stumbled into this table. knocking off all the china. and the glassware. and then proceeded to put her fist through the windowpane.
At times like that. the filth that came out of her mouth!
Why. it was worthy of a man who'd spent his entire life at sea.
Well. undoubtedly she learned it from just such men.
Men?
Oh. at her age. she was carrying on with strangers who would call in the middle of the night. write letters to her.
Yes. I'd prefer to forget that she was ever here. my dear.
Well. you've certainly had your share of strange experiences.
Of course... hiring women from an ad could be a risky business.
How do you make your choices?
Well. I take into account their experience. their references.
Could be dangerous. though. living way out here in the desert. no protection to speak of.
Oh. I've never been afraid.
Not of people.
My. isn't that nice.
You don't think it has a bitter taste?
Does it?
Well. I'm afraid so.
Distinctly bitter flavor.
Did you get this at the market?
Pheasant is hardly an item you'd expect to find on supermarket shelves.
These birds were brought to me by George.
What's the matter?
Aren't you going to eat it at all?
Why not play it safe.
Mrs. Marrable?
I've seen enough in my years as a nurse to scare me. especially where there's money...
You didn't finish your sentence.
I've been taken off a case when the patient showed the first signs of improvement.
Doctor wanted me to stay on for a while. but not the family.
When the patient died...
You blame me for wondering if it wasn't a bit... unnatural?
George and Julia.
What an absurd notion!
You are far too permissive with your fantasies.
People don't go around murdering each other.
May not be as difficult as you think.
It's not very perceptive of you to minimize the courage that it takes to kill.
Courage?
Why. it's just nerve with a dash of cruelty.
You're mistaken.
It takes extraordinary courage born of inner fortitude.
My father told me that. and he was an authority. having spent his life in the military establishment.
It takes extraordinary courage.
Well. if you're not afraid. why don't you eat your pheasant?
I've lost my appetite.
Mrs. Dimmock.
Sabre Irdustries.
This is Mrs. Claire Marrable calling from Tucson.
I believe you wrote a letter of reference for Mrs. Dimmock. who is now in my employ.
I would like to verify that she worked for you and that you found her satisfactory.
Sure. She worked for my mother for over two years.
A wonderful woman.
I'll tell you this. though... she's got an Irish temper. and if it shows up. you'd better watch out.
Thank you.
Sure. Ary time. Mrs. Marrable.
You're lucky to lave ler.
Good-bye.
You're shaking like a leaf.
Take it easy. will you?
The queen of spades won't be back for a while.
I don't like to take unnecessary chances.
You said they went out to dinner.
I didn't want you here today.
I told you I'd stay in touch with you.
I've had it with the blank postcards and this whole damn mystery bit!
You're getting out of here and going home with me right now.
You can't go on playing this part.
I haven't been found out yet. and I won't. if you don't give me away.
You don't have the strength...
- Never felt stronger in my life.
...or the training.
You don't appreciate my talent.
I have to stay here.
Now. you're entitled to think that
I'm playing with the squirrels. but don't ask me to leave.
Just don't!
Those blank postcards were your idea.
I had to know you were all right.
If they're piling up too high for you.
I'll stop sending them.
Let me take the statue.
Aunt Claire.
You've got to stop blaming yourself for Miss Tinsley.
How can I?
It was my fault.
Of course I didn't mean the things I said. but say them I did.
I'm not going to give up until I find out where she is.
My instincts tell me something happened to her. here.
You just can't jump to conclusions.
Not just the Bible.
Mrs. Marrable's housekeepers seem to vanish.
And you haven't heard her talk about the courage to kill!
Let's get out of here.
There's one thing that I want you to do for me.
Help you pack.
Go to the First National Bank in Phoenix.
Find out if Edna still has money in her savings account.
You just can't walk into a bank...
You'll find a way.
Oh. please.
After that.
I'll do whatever you say.
I'll leave this house.
Is that good enough?
And I also want... her forwarding address!
Go. Go!
- Where's your shoes?
- Wait a minute! My shoes!
Won't you come in for a drink?
Well. thank you. Aunt Claire. but we should be going.
Very well.
And thank you for entertaining me so regally.
Will you call me before long?
We will.
Good-bye.
Forgot to say good-bye.
You're sure you wouldn't be interested in the polo match at the Bennetts' on Saturday?
Aunt Claire doesn't like polo.
You know that. George.
Well. thank you anyway.
George. Good-bye.
Thanks.
Oh. my.
I must have dozed off.
Did you have a pleasant time at the fair?
Why did you let her pick the most expensive statue they had?
It's a good long-term investment. Julia.
Yes. George. but are we so sure that Aunt Claire is a sound stock?
You mean because she never pays for anything when she's with us?
She thinks we're loaded.
Well. we're so smart. we've fooled her. haven't we?
But she might be playing the same game.
We can give you the information. Mr. Darrah.
Miss Edna Tinsley's current balance is $32.83.
She withdrew $9.000 on March 5th?
Yes. She took out the entire amount in cash.
You have her latest forwarding address?
Yeah. it's right here on the card.
"Care of Marrable.
Route 3. Tucson."
- Thank you.
- Right.
Oh. yes. Mrs. Marrable is terribly rich.
However. I doubt that auto races will appeal to Aunt Claire. but she'll take to you.
Well. if all the proceeds are going to her Indian charity. she ought to go for it.
Even if she doesn't.
I'm enchanted that you called me.
Hey. Harriet! Come here!
Come here!
Look over there.
If I could use your phone.
Mrs. Marrable.
I could call the manager of the racetrack and check on available dates right now.
Oh. please do.
Yes?
Thank you.
My housekeeper will show you the phone.
Mrs. Dimmock. this is Mr. Darrah.
He would like to make a phone call.
Certainly. This way. please.
Mister... I didn't catch the name.
Darrah.
How is that you've never introduced me to Mr. Darrah before?
Well. we've only met recently.
Actually. George hasn't even met him yet.
Would you tell dear George to call me this evening. Julia?
Certainly.
I must talk to him about those stocks. which do nothing but go down.
Mr. Johnson. please.
They've both been dropping points every day. causing me great concern.
- Well. that's just...
- Pack up. Aunt Alice!
I mean it! You're going back to Phoenix with me now!
...stocks sometimes dip...
You promised if you...
You promised if you got this information...
Stop whispering.
What are you going to do exactly?
I want to know!
...tip on those stocks.
I'm sure.
Stocks do go up and down so rapidly sometimes.
Well. that's the market for you. Aunt Claire.
I told George to sell before I took a loss.
He procrastinated until it was too late.
You're leaving with me!
I'll meet you at the market on Route 4.
9:00 tomorrow morning.
You'd better not let me down.
Aunt Alice. I mean it.
Yeah. I see. No. that's all right.
I'll call back.
Yeah. thank you.
I mean it!
- Would you pour?
- Love to.
It's better to perish than fail to maintain appearances.
That's a trait George inherited from his grandfather. my father.
Very few of us understood Papa.
He was a gentleman of style. of true style.
That's the word that I've been trying to think of. "style."
That's what you have.
Mrs. Marrable. style.
I thank you.
I should hope so.
And a flair for things.
I wish I had.
I wish I had your flair for money.
I don't believe I ever heard you mention money before.
But it's hardly a flair. dear Mrs. Dimmock.
I'm not a greedy woman. but it irks me to see how little my money earns in the bank.
When you talk about your stocks. they sound fabulous.
Yes. All except those George recommends.
Don't you have a stockbroker in Chicago. too?
Yes.
Would you be willing to speak to him about me?
I'd like to invest my money. and I need good advice.
And you shall have it.
The stock market is one thing if you can stand the loss without being hurt. but if it's your life savings you're speculating with. don't dream of doing anything so foolish.
I wouldn't have the nerve to bother you if I wanted to invest a mere dribble.
Now. this won't sound like much to you. but I've amassed a goodly sum.
Have you?
How much. Mrs. Dimmock?
Well...
I must admit. in my wildest dreams...
I never thought such an amount could be accumulated by serving as a housekeeper. even companion.
My husband left a generous insurance policy.
Even so. 46.000 could provide a handsome livelihood for a woman for quite a few years.
You're extremely fortunate.
Now will you speak to your broker?
We'll see.
We'll see.
You have to let me sleep and think on it.
May I have another cup?
Get out of my garden!
Get out of my garden. you...
Harriet!
You get that dog out of my garden at once!
What happened?
I'm awfully sorry!
You deliberately enticed that dog here to destroy my grounds.
It's impossible to keep him out of your garden.
Maybe if we put up a small fence.
Are you taking it upon yourself to tell me what to do with my property?
I was suggesting a way to protect your garden.
You've had no compunction about taking the time of my companion. poking into my affairs. and overtly displaying your hatred of me.
What do you want from me. Mrs. Vaughn?
I don't want anything from you.
You really expect me to believe that?
Please go back to the cottage.
Seems I'm powerless.
I wouldn't let her upset me.
She's like crabgrass... never really quelled. only cropping up secretly and victoriously in another spot.
Well. I do not intend to sit here and wait while she thinks up a new way to harass me.
I won't have to.
We will go to the Indian
Music Festival in Tortugas.
It's only a day's drive. and I've been wanting to hear their chants and see their dancing.
We'll leave first thing in the morning. Mrs. Dimmock.
You don't dislike traveling. I trust?
No.
If I'd known. I'd have bought stockings in town this morning.
These are gone... they're my last pair... and I'm out of toothpaste.
I know you don't like to lend yours.
I want to leave first thing in the morning. Mrs. Dimmock. without delay.
Do you mind if I drive into town now?
The new market has both nylons and toothpaste.
Very well.
You may take the car.
And get a roadmap at the service station. will you?
Don't be too long.
I'll get it.
Hi.
We saw you with that other broad.
Harriet. you've got the wrong idea.
If you'd just let me tell you something.
Are you gonna let him. after what he did to you?
Shut up. Jim!
Look. we can't talk here.
Come with me.
All you have to do is listen.
All right.
But I hope you have something to say.
I'm back.
I'm back.
I must've dozed off.
I found everything I needed.
Would you like to study the roadmap?
Thank you.
I think I ought to start dinner.
Let's have a very light supper this evening. since we want to retire at an early hour.
Would you write a letter to Juan reminding him to cover the roses with burlap?
I certainly will.
Will you do it now. please?
It's the kind of last-minute detail we might overlook.
I forgot.
Juan's taking a week's vacation.
It'll be his helper who attends my garden.
What is his name?
Alfredo? Alberto?
You'd better just put "Al." and then we'll be correct in any case.
I'll take care of it.
Just leave it on the table.
Turn that off. will you?
I think we can do without music tonight.
Will you have your liqueur?
Is there any particular reason why I shouldn't?
Did I tell you to help yourself?
Well. I'm very sorry.
I hate a sticky bottle.
I told you.
I made a promise.
I'll tell you the whole story tomorrow. and you'll see it's got nothing to do with you and me.
Vow of silence again?
Suppose I have nothing to say.
Well. I said something.
Did you hear me?
I said I love you.
I didn't ask for that.
I know you didn't.
But I know if I lie.
I'll lose you.
I don't want to lose you.
Harriet.
Do you still want to go home?
No.
Do you believe me now?
I'm not sure. but I don't want to go home.
I'm going to leave the note for the gardener.
Please forgive me for not knocking.
I forgot my manners in my anxiety to see that every window in the house is tightly closed.
If it should rain. my floors would turn into soaking sponges.
Yes.
The weather report is ghastly... high winds. terrible drop in temperature.
We may have to postpone our trip.
The sun will be shining for us when we get to New Mexico.
I promise you.
Have a good sleep.
Mrs. Dimmock.
It's a coincidence. isn't it?
I couldn't sleep either.
Yes.
I never can sleep through the night before a trip.
I guess it's because
I haven't traveled much.
Sleeplessness can be brought on by any number of apprehensions.
In your case. I daresay even I can diagnose the cause.
You've been too preoccupied about your money.
Oh. no.
It's the last thing on my mind.
I think I'll have some hot milk.
Perhaps it will help me sleep.
When I turned on the light. you were on the verge of making a phone call.
Yes.
I was checking with the weather bureau.
I thought you might be calling the market to order new toothpaste and stockings.
What a fraud you are!
You come into my house in the guise of a faithful companion.
You want to utterly destroy me.
- I didn't come here to destroy.
- You did. however. lie.
So did you.
Edna never left this house. did she?
What was Edna Tinsley to you?
For many. many years she lived in my house.
We ate together. and shopped and traveled.
She was my companion.
Do you expect me to believe that...
I don't care what you believe!
I shared bread with my companion. not crumbs.
- I never humiliated her.
- She left your service?
Yes. she did. and that was my doing.
She was ready to come back to me.
She told me so over the phone. her voice shaking she was so frightened of you!
Where is she?!
When you left the house this afternoon. you went to meet someone. didn't you?
That girl across the way.
How many women have you killed?
You could have lasted quite a few years.
You expect me to be flattered?
I expected a little loyalty.
It isn't often that I find someone whose company I enjoy. truly enjoy.
I saw many happy years ahead for both of us.
You are the only mistake I made.
Didn't you ever think you'd be found out?
No! And I won't be!
You've given yourself away.
To you?
You are a dead woman.
Oh. no.
I'm alive. see?
I'm very much alive. and I'm not going to be your next victim!
Dead.
It was dead all the time!
Good morning. Your nephew called a few minutes ago.
Your phone hasn't been answering. and he's concerned.
Won't you please come in?
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting in that awful wind.
Would you call George and assure him we have survived the storm?
Of course. poor Mrs. Dimmock went out early this morning in spite of all my warnings and received a terrible blow from a tree branch.
Oh. will you excuse me a moment?
- You go ahead. Help yourself.
- No. thank you. l...
I wish you wouldn't try to get up.
At least not yet.
I do insist that you continue resting.
She wants to drive into town to get my sinus prescription filled.
It's a touching gesture. I must say. but I shan't allow her to do it.
Well. maybe I could.
I wouldn't think of it. Mrs. Vaughn.
My sinus isn't that serious.
Well. maybe I can get Mrs. Dimmock a doctor.
She's recovering very nicely.
However. if you could report my phone. we'd be able to communicate with the outside world again.
I'd be glad to.
Thank you so very much.
Mrs. Vaughn.
We will pretend that you are loyal to the bitter end. running off to fill my prescription no matter what the weather. or your own health.
How is Mrs. Marrable?
Fire. except for
a sirus leadacle.
Sinus headache.
I'll tell him.
I imagine we'll be out to see her after a while.
All right. then.
Yeah. Bye-bye.
Hey. Harriet. I thought you said
Mrs. Dimmock was sick.
Come here. Iook at her.
I'm surprised she got her way.
What are you trying to tell me?
I told...
Who did you tell?
Who?!
Was it the girl across the road. your friend?
Who?!
Tell me this instant!
Tell me who!
If they were up early this morning. how come nobody's answering?
I don't know. Mike.
Mrs. Dimmock went off in the car.
- How long ago?
- About a couple of hours.
- You live here?
- No. my aunt does.
I hope you've got a key.
No one's opening the door.
Aunt Claire. are you all right?
What?
What's going on?
Ma'am. your phone's out of order. I have to check it.
Yes. of course.
Please come in.
- Where's Mrs. Dimm...
- Isn't she here?
Oh. She must have gone to the drugstore after all.
Nothing would satisfy Mrs. Dimmock. but she had to fetch my medicine. and I took two pills. and she...
Must've been quite potent!
I still feel rather groggy.
Mr. Darrah. how nice to see you again.
And won't you come in. too. Mrs. Vaughn?
You haven't seen
Mrs. Dimmock. have you?
I saw her drive away a while ago.
Isn't she back yet?
Well. it seems she's not.
Phone's working fine.
By the way. there's a call for you. Mrs. Marrable.
Would you get it. George?
What drugstore did she usually go to?
I don't know. Why?
I thought we might call and find out if she'd been there or when she left.
Aunt Claire?
I'm afraid this is going to come as quite a shock to you...
Mrs. Dimmock was found in your car.
It went off the dirt road into the lake.
Yes?
And Mrs. Dimmock?
Well. I'm afraid she's dead.
M o o a o
I trust you.
Why can't you trust me?
You said she was hurt.
Yes. by a branch.
- Mrs. Marrable said she was...
- Are you quoting me. Mrs. Vaughn?
I'm sorry.
She shouldn't have been driving if she felt sick.
Is the car wrecked?
Oh. Julia!
It's not unfeeling to be practical.
Why was she so eager to drive off this morning?
If I were you. Aunt Claire. I'd check and see if everything's all right.
I don't understand you people!
You blame her. you suspect her. and no one has a kind word to say.
Fate has dealt me a cruel enough blow without your compounding it.
I don't understand you either.
Mrs. Marrable.
- Nobody seems to care.
- Well. I care.
M o o a o
I've got to go to town.
I'll be back.
Yes?
This is your very distressed neighbor.
I'm dreadfully lonely.
Will you and James join me for cocktails?
I'll have something different for him. of course.
I'm afraid
I have some errands.
I would be ever so grateful if you would come to see me this afternoon.
Won't you please?
Please.
All right. I'll come.
Wonderful. Wonderful.
Will 5:30 suit you?
Fire.
When are you gonna talk to Mrs. Marrable?
Why are you picking on her?
You're not from around here.
You don't know her like we do.
Is she above suspicion. Sheriff?
You're crazy.
You're sure that eggnog is all right?
Yes. it's fine.
You know. Mrs. Dimmock and I used to sit here every evening before dinner.
I'm sure we shall both miss her.
Isn't that true. Mrs. Vaughn?
Yes. I'll miss her.
I didn't know her that well.
You didn't?
Nevertheless... she told me that she was so pleased to have found a neighbor she could confide in.
Confide?
I'm afraid that we have to go now.
Already?
I haven't had a good look at these stamps yet.
You may take them with you.
Yeah? The sword. too?
Of course. You may have the whole briefcase.
For good?
I really don't think you should.
I insist.
James. you haven't finished your eggnog.
We really should be going.
I'll help you carry your briefcase home.
You'll never have a case against Mrs. Marrable. so why am I wasting my time with witnesses?
This is the first and the last.
Juan. come in.
Juan. this gentleman wants to talk to you... about Mrs. Marrable.
Mrs. Marrable.
But why didn't you tell me?
I thought it was something bad.
Come in here!
They've torn you out by your roots.
This is my garden.
This is my house.
This is my land.
And you trespassed!
You trampled my flower bed. and you killed my pine trees!
You had no right!
You had no right!
Who gave you the right to do this. to deprive me?
Who?
I'm still alive. Mrs. Marrable. in spite of your eggnog and your fire.
I've got to be grateful to Mike for that.
Harriet says
I've gotta return this even though you gave it to me to keep.
These stamps are worth a whole lot.
Mr. Darrah says they're worth over $100.000.
Joseph...
Marrable.
He must've hated me more than I hated him.
Would you kindly drive me into town?
Since I'm all alone. it seems fitting that
I should apply for a position.
I think I would make a most acceptable companion. don't you agree?
I have savings of my own... and I have no one left in the world.
After all...
I'd make a very handsome pine tree!
Katya...
Don't, you mustn't. It was all such a long time ago, Georgia.
Not for me, Katya.
Not for me.
It's the blood of m y daughter on that blade.
I cling to m y hatred as I cling to this dagger.
Before I die, I swear I'll see this dagger plunged into his throat.
As I saw it in Tanya's because of him.
Crying won't help now.
He's back. Kurt is back.
Georgia.
Yes... Kurt is back. You can't stop the hand of fate.
My lord! My lord! Kurt is back!
What did you say?
Kurt is back.
Yes, Losat, I'm back.
I told you never to come back.
Who are you trying to frighten,
Kurt?
No one... I came back because I heard of your marriage.
Good luck.
My compliments, Nevenka.
Thank you, Kurt.
Tell the truth, Kurt. What do you want?
Brother, I came back to compliment you on your choice of a wife.
You must be tired, Kurt.
Kurt, you're not m y son. You're a serpent. You like to make others suffer.
You seduced Tanya, and then abandoned her, causing her to kill herself.
The same old story.
Father, you promised.
He didn't come back to seek m y forgiveness.
You're so wrong, father. I also came back for that.
No, I don't believe you.
Are you afraid of me,
Christian?
That which was once mine is now yours. Now, it is you who are the favorite son.
I've never been afraid of you.
As far as I'm concerned, you can stay if you want to.
All right, Kurt, you can stay.
I've never had a warmer welcome.
It's wonderful to see things being born, to see them born and to see them die.
Let me go.
My pretty little cousin. You're still in love with m y brother. You wouldn't exactly refuse him if he...
You miserable wretch.
You always wanted to marry him. And instead? Christian's marriage was bitter for you too.
Poisoned?
No, that's not the way it'll be, Kurt
Menliff. You'll die the same way you made m y daughter die.
I obtained forgiveness from the masters. I would not presume to that of the servants.
Ah, here are the masters.
I see you've already had your tea, Kurt.
Yes, I'm not in the habit of waiting.
Nobody asked you to.
You did well to remind me.
You shouldn't treat him like that.
You'll only make things worse.
You don't know him well, if you think he could be worse.
Father. There was a time when you weren't so afraid when I came to say goodnight.
You showed me the way. I've never forgotten it.
What do you want?
I have your forgiveness, but I must have m y rights restored to me, m y title and patrimony.
I shall soon be dead. I have not enough time to put you to the test.
Whatever was yours, you forfeited, forever. You did it yourself with your infam y.
Be careful, father.
Get out of here! Get out, I tell you.
I think you've got something against me. Isn't that true?
You're wrong. I've nothing for or against you.
Are you afraid of me?
You were fond of me once.
Yes, once.
You haven't changed, I see.
You always loved violence.
You two, search the grounds.
Where is Nevenka?
And how should I know?
And that whip?
This? I found it on the road a few yards outside the gate. I've been looking at m y estates.
It'll soon be night. It'll be harder to find her.
She's right. You'd better hurry.
Let's go.
They make quite a couple, but
I have the impression that Katya isn't so eager to find Nevenka.
You don't agree? You're an old fool, Georgia.
Let's light a lantern. I want to have a look in the moats.
Kurt...
Kurt...
My lady. My lady. Georgia,
Georgia. I found her. My lady.
God be praised. I thought she was dead. Let's take her home. Come, help me carry her.
She'll come around very soon now. It must have been fear more than anything else.
She must have been thrown from the saddle.
Where is Kurt?
Go call him.
Yes, sir.
Losat.
Losat.
What's wrong with her?
Only some welts on her back as though... as though somebody has whipped her, m y lord.
Go, go on.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Kurt? Mr. Kurt?
Kurt!
Father, don't look.
I had to stand the sight of him alive. It... it can't be any worse now.
Look. Look. The dagger.
The dagger. It's Tanya's. He's died the same death she did.
Tanya. Tanya. Rest now in peace.
God. Dear God. Thank you.
Thank you.
Have mercy on me, oh, God, according to Thy great mercy.
Block out mine inequities.
Wash me from mine inequities and cleanse me from m y sins, for I acknowledge mine inequity and m y sin is always before me. Against
Thee only have I sinned and done evil before Thee. For behold, I was conceived in inequities and in sins that m y mother conceived me. Turn away Thy face from m y sins.
Cast me not away from Thy face and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. Eternal rest, grant unto him, oh, Lord, Absolve the souls of the faithful departed from every bond of sin and by the help of Thy grace, may they be enabled to escape the avenging judgement. Oh, God, by whose mercy the souls of the faithful find rest, bless this grave. Release the souls of all those buried here that they may rejoice with Thy saints forever through Christ our Lord, Amen.
Now, our son, Kurt Menliff, is ready for the last judgment. Let us pray for him.
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Ghost, amen.
Who is it?
It is I, Christian.
What do you want?
I want to speak to you, father.
I'm listening, son.
I... I wanted to speak to you about Kurt. It is hard for me to ask this, but I've got to know.
What?
Everybody was away. There was only you in the castle, you and Kurt.
You... you dare ask if I...
I've always obeyed you, father, as you well know. I have never dared to question you.
Get out!
Out of obedience, I married the woman you had once intended for m y brother. But now I must know.
What do you want to know?
If it was you who killed him, it's an act of justice.
Get out. Get out.
Thank you, Georgia.
What's wrong? Tell me.
I saw Losat. He said he saw a shadow moving in the chapel and a light.
Losat is crazier than you. It was obviously only the reflection of the moon.
- Kurt.
- Nevenka.
Kurt.
Nevenka, what's the matter?
It was Kurt. He was watching me. I saw him.
You mustn't be afraid. It was only an hallucination. If you want, I can stay with you tonight.
No, go to bed. I want to be alone.
All right, dear. I'll leave m y door open. Call me if you need anything.
Kurt.
Kurt. Oh, oh...
No. No. No. No. No.
Nevenka. What's wrong?
Tell me. What happened?
Kurt was here, alive. And he had his boots full of mud, as though he had climbed out of the grave.
Calm down, please, you've had a nightmare. There's no one here but me.
Look. He was the one who did this to me. And besides, there are the footprints.
What footprints?
They were there.
Nevenka, it was only a bad dream. There's nothing there.
Look for yourself.
No, no, it wasn't a dream. He was here, I tell you, he was here.
I saw the footprints and his hand.
Oh, m y God, his hand. It came out of the shadows like a spider. Oh, help me, Christian, help me.
Are you afraid? You always loved violence. You haven't changed and you never will.
My lady, you. I heard noises and
I came down to look. I thought...
What did you think?
Nothing. The dead can't move from their tombs.
Maybe they do, if they don't find peace.
Yes, we were happy then. Now, m y life is empty and meaningless.
Do you remember that lake we used to go to, that one up in the mountains?
You used to said with me in m y boat. You were just a little girl then.
Yes, I used to follow you everywhere.
Christian, why did you do that?
Katya, listen. We can still be happy.
No, it's too late now. It's too late.
No, no, dear, don't say that.
I've always loved you. And you love me, don't you?
Yes, Christian, I love you and
I'll always love you, but you're married now.
No, don't... don't touch me.
Call him. Call him and tell him you've always been mine.
No, I don't want you. I don't want you.
I've come back for you and to get m y revenge on all those who hate me.
You better leave, Georgia. Besides, there's nothing you can do now.
Just like Kurt.
The dagger has disappeared.
The count told me that... that it was here.
It's his revenge. He'll kill us all because we're all to blame.
Stop talking nonsense, Nevenka.
Are you trying to drive us crazy?
Someone will pay for this, father, be it man or ghost,
I promise you.
Christian, I've been looking for you.
What for?
I don't know. I thought perhaps if I was near I could help you.
No, dear, the only thing that will help me now is to be able to get revenge.
Leave me alone now, please. In a while, I'll come back to you.
Ah, it's me, Losat. I didn't mean to frighten you, miss. I've been watching Christian.
I'm worried about him. Listen, I've been wanting to ask you something for some time.
What?
The night when we were searching the motes for Nevenka.
Yes.
Did you stay all the time with Christian?
Yes, I think so. Why?
Are you sure that he never left you, never for a moment?
No. But, why do you ask?
You don't think that Christian...
Why, I don't think anything.
That's absurd.
Why the old count too? Why?
Georgia. You're the one who's got the dagger in your hand.
You can tell me everything, Katya.
I don't pretend to condemn you.
Oh, stop it. Where did you get that dagger?
You know very well, Katya, don't force me to say it.
Oh, stop it, please. You had a reason to kill Kurt, not I. Tell me where you found that knife.
Under the mattress of your bed, Katya.
No!
Christian.
Christian, I know who killed your father.
What?
Yes. I could have killed Kurt. Oh, you bet I could. But, the count, no.
I'd never kill him, you understand?
If you found that knife there, then you or somebody else put it there.
It wasn't I, Katya, not I.
Throw away that cursed knife.
I don't want to ever see it again.
Throw it away.
No, Katya, no. It's not possible.
You don't believe me. You think I'm lying. Answer me.
I don't know. I don't know. I can't possibly imagine that one of us is a murderer. No, it's absurd.
But, still, somebody here killed him.
But, now we know, Christian.
No, Katya no.
You're a coward. You're afraid to face the truth. Kurt in your place...
Kurt. Kurt. It's always him,
Kurt instead of me. He's the one you've always loved.
That's not true. That's not true.
And you've always wanted to marry him. I've always known it.
If that's why you killed him, it was a useless crime. I hated him. I've always hated him. I hated him.
Novenka!
I heard screaming. I thought it came from your father's room.
She's not here. Let's look in her room.
The footprints lead toward the garden. Someone carried her off.
You'd better wait here.
Christian, don't go alone.
Katya, come inside, Katya.
Please, come inside.
Losat. What are you doing here?
Oh, it's you, me lord.
Where have you taken
Nevenka?
Me?
There were footprints from boots just like you have.
I was making m y rounds at the castle when I thought that I saw somebody in here.
Don't lie to me, Losat.
Oh, no.
There was no one else in here but you.
My lord, you don't think that...
Quiet. Come along.
The footprints are coming from the secret passage.
Help me.
But, who could have put her in there?
Nevenka, Nevenka.
Kurt.
How is Nevenka?
Delirious. She said it was Kurt who carried her there. She also said that he whipped her,
He carried her to the crypt and put her in the tomb. We've got to help,
Katya, do something.
This time I even heard Kurt's laugh.
But, I still can't bring m yself to believe in ghosts.
I know it's difficult to understand, but what do we know about what happens after death?
I almost believe he's alive.
Alive? But you saw him too. You saw him when he was placed in the casket.
With our own eyes, we both saw him buried. I don't really believe that
Nevenka saw him out there.
No, no, there's no other possible explanation. Kurt's still alive and hiding in the castle.
I've got to find him. I'll go crazy. For a moment, I've suspected you... I've suspected m yself.
Then, if what you say is true, he could have hidden the dagger in m y room. I'm afraid, Christian.
Katya.
Oh, Christian, there was someone here.
Calm down, Katya, it's all right.
I'll go and look.
There are the footprints.
They're the same.
What are you going to do?
Open the coffin. Help me.
Carry it over there.
Nevenka.
They're opening m y tomb. This is the last time I can be with you.
Why do you torture me?
Because you belong to me, only to me.
What do you want?
We've got to go away from here forever right now.
I can't do that.
Yes, you will. You love me. And your love for me is greater than anything in this world.
I hate you. I hate you.
I hate you. I...
It's not recognizable. It could be anybody.
The clothes are Kurt's. Let's put it back in the tomb, for
God's sake.
No.
What are you doing now?
I'll destroy it.
Where are you, Kurt?
I'm coming, Kurt. I've never been afraid of you.
Nevenka.
My lord. Oh, sir, what happened? Are you hurt?
Come on. It's not important.
Hurry. It's locked from the inside. We'll have to go by way of the chapel.
Yes, you're right.
Why? Why did I do it, Kurt?
Why?
I love you, Kurt, only you.
You were right. I love you, Kurt, only you. But, there's an end to everything, Kurt.
No, no, Nevenka, no.
Nevenka.
Forgive me. I had to do what... what Kurt told me. I killed him again, this time for good.
He hated you. I love you. Christian.
So, she was the one. She killed your brother and your father.
Yes. Perhaps she was possessed.
She was convinced Kurt was alive.
She killed herself thinking she was killing him. Let's hope she's free of him forever.
Good afternoon, Miss Gault.
Good afternoon, Judson.
I'd like to see...
Hello, Kate.
What do you want?
Will you tell Guy that
I would like to see him?
I'm afraid he doesn't wish to see you.
I shall have to hear that from Guy himself.
Oh, really, Kate, don't you think... at least I deserve an explanation?
Very well.
Will you please wait here?
I'm sorry.
Guy does not wish to see you.
I told you I'd have to hear that from Guy himself.
Guy?
Emily.
Emily, you... you shouldn't have come here.
So I understand.
But, Guy, don't you think
I deserve something... a little more than a letter?
Look at me and tell me you don't love me.
My darling,
I do love you... very much.
That's why I sent you that letter... because I do love you.
Now, darling, please go away and forget you ever met me.
I know what happened, Guy.
My father told me.
Did he tell you why?
Despite what he thinks...
I didn't run away from what was inside that coffin... but from what I knew to be inside me.
I... I don't understand.
I'd hoped to spare you this.
If you do understand, then you'll realize...
Why there can never be a marriage between us.
Come with me.
Where does this lead?
Below.
Are you all right?
Yes, I... I think so.
Do you want to go back?
No. No.
You've often expressed a wish to meet the rest of my family.
Well, here they are... all my ancestors, famous and infamous... laid here to... what is the term?
To rest.
From the beginning, death has come... to the Carrells like an assassin... but the least fortunate of all was my father.
How did he die?
Like a single candle in a dark and airless room.
Emily, my father...
Guy.
Kate, why are you here?
It's time for your medicine.
Oh, yes. I'd forgotten.
I'm sorry. Thank you.
What medicine?
Laudanum.
Guy, is this the cause of...
No. Not a cause. An effect.
Without it, I couldn't sleep.
Guy, tell me.
I should never have gone with your father... and those other doctors that night.
I'm interested only in private research.
I can never forget that poor wretch...
Whose grave they robbed.
His staring eyes... his clutching hands... his fingernails broken and bloody... from the vain attempt to claw away... the lid of that coffin.
You see, all this has a special meaning for me, Emily.
For years,
I've lived in dread... of being buried alive.
Can you possibly conceive it?
The unendurable oppression of the lungs... the stifling fumes of the damp earth... the rigid embrace of the coffin... the blackness of absolute night... and the silence... like an overwhelming sea.
And then, invisible in the darkness... but all too hideously real to the other senses... the presence of the conqueror worm.
Guy!
I'm sorry.
These are just morbid fantasies.
I'm afraid not.
Every member of my family... has met with a violent and horrible death.
I now wait my turn.
How did your father die?
Catalepsy.
Do you know what that is?
When it strikes... the victim gives every outWard sign of being dead.
But he's not dead. He's alive.
I was barely 13 when my father was stricken.
Doctor said it was a heart attack... and there was a funeral... and he was sealed in this vault.
That night...
I heard him crying out... a pitiful, desperate cry.
I begged with them.
I pleaded with them.
"He's alive.
He's alive", I said... but no one would believe me.
Because it wasn't true.
It was!
I heard him.
In your mind.
No, Kate.
It would be easier for me to accept that.
But I know the truth.
God help me,
I know the truth!
My father's inheritance and my wedding gift to you... catalepsy.
Now you know why
I asked your forgiveness.
There's nothing to forgive.
But you must understand...
I understand that I love you... and that I want to be your wife.
Miss Gault...
My brother is ill.
Then I shall nurse him back to health.
Emily...
Guy, if you love me... if you really love me... you won't shut me out of your life.
You'll let me share it with you.
You want that?
After what you've heard?
More than ever before.
Tell her, Guy.
Tell her.
Kate... you've been most considerate... and you've always thought of my welfare.
That is true.
But in some things,
I must make my own decisions.
Of course.
Then I take it you have made your decision?
I have.
Then let it be on your own head.
Do you, Guy... take Emily to be your lawful wedded wife... for better, for worse, in sickness and in health...
So long as ye both shall live?
I do.
Do you, Emily, take Guy... to be your lawful wedded husband... for better, for worse... in sickness and in health...
So long as ye both shall live?
I do.
If there be any here who know just cause...
Why these two should not be joined together... in holy matrimony... let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
The ring, please.
Repeat after me.
With this ring, I thee wed.
Then I do pronounce you man and wife.
Champagne, Lady Catherine?
Thank you.
Oh, yes, a beautiful ceremony.
A toast... to the most beautiful bride... and the most fortunate groom who ever lived.
May they be happy to the end of their days.
No, Guy. Not in front of everyone.
Well, then, you'd better go and play something... before I lose control completely.
Isn't she beautiful?
Very.
Are you enjoying yourself, father?
Hmm?
Don't stop playing, Emily.
It's lovely.
I want to wish you every happiness.
Thank you, Miles.
You're going to Venice... for the honeymoon, I understand.
What was that? I... I'm sorry.
I inquired if you were going to Venice for your honeymoon... and I'm not accustomed to people...
Carrell!
Forgive me, please.
What the devil's the matter with the fella?
- Emily.
- Yes, darling?
That melody you're playing... what is it?
"Molly Malone".
Don't you like it?
No. Please stop playing.
But it's a charming melody.
I said please stop playing it!
I'm sorry. I...
Is there anything I can do, Guy?
No, nothing.
I'll come with you, Guy.
No. Please leave me alone!
All of you, leave me alone, please!
Guy. Guy, darling.
Please wake up.
They've all gone now.
Yes, Emily.
Are you feeling better?
I think so.
What's the matter, Guy?
What happened to you down there?
I can't remember, exactly.
I was talking with your father, and then...
And then what?
The music.
Something about the music you were playing.
What was it about the music?
It was the tune he was whistling that night.
Who was?
There were two of them.
Sweeney and Mole were their names.
Oh, filthy, disgusting creatures.
They were the ones who opened the grave... and all the time whistling that loathsome tune.
Darling...
Now we're alone.
Alone.
Just the two of us.
Together.
What was that?
I don't know.
It sounded like a scream.
Stay here.
King.
King, old fellow.
He is dead.
It must have been the lightning.
We'll bury him.
As you wish.
Now let us go in out of the rain, Guy.
Why, he was only stunned.
I was going to bury him.
Guy.
I was going to bury him... alive!
Sketching? Out here?
No, not sketching, really.
Making plans.
For the house?
You're very inquisitive.
Well, I'm married now... and wives are supposed to be inquisitive.
And husbands are supposed to be secretive.
However, I'll tell you one of my secrets... a very closely guarded one.
I possess the ability to kiss a woman without touching her.
Oh, Guy, really.
You don't believe me?
I'll wager you a shilling.
All right.
I'll accept your wager.
Come on. Show me this miracle.
With pleasure.
There you are.
What about your wager?
Oh, I lose the wager.
Here's your shilling.
It was worth much more, believe me.
Guy.
Yes, dear?
What about our honeymoon?
You promised you'd take me to Venice, remember?
Aren't you happy here?
Oh, yes, of course... but, well, you're on your own so much... and I worry about you.
You must be patient with me.
All right.
In the meantime...
I'll brighten up that dreary old house.
There.
Look. Aren't they lovely?
Take them away!
Guy, don't be so ill-tempered.
I can't bear living in a house without flowers... and neither should you.
Just throw them away!
I loathe flowers.
You must promise never to bring... those sickly funeral decorations into the house.
Guy, I was only...
You must promise!
All right.
I promise.
Milady?
Yes, Judson.
Dr. Archer has arrived, milady.
Oh. Show him in, please.
- This way, sir.
- Thank you, Judson.
Emily.
Miles, dear, how kind of you to come.
I came directly.
I received your message.
Is something wrong?
Yes.
Guy is ill.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
I suppose it's the Italian climate.
But we didn't go to Italy.
But I thought...
We've been here in this house... ever since the day we were married.
I don't understand.
Neither do I.
All I know is that Guy is ill... and you've got to help him, Miles.
My dear, surely your father... has done everything that can be done.
My father has done nothing.
To him, Guy is a perfectly healthy man... but that isn't true... and you must do something to help him, Miles.
If you don't, something terrible will happen.
He's a completely changed man.
I don't even recognize him.
Well, I'll do whatever I can.
Why don't you take me to him?
Thank you, Miles.
I'll just get my wrap.
Your wrap?
It's chilly on the moors.
Emily...
Where is he?
There.
He started building it a month ago.
Guy?
Yes?
Let me in.
Go away. I'm busy.
Guy, please open the door.
Emily, didn't you understand me? I said I...
Hello, Guy.
Hello, Miles.
I'm glad to see you.
I must apologize.
I was very rude.
Yes, Guy, you were.
Very rude.
You see, I've been quite ill.
So I understand.
Guy, I have brought
Miles along... to see if he can help you.
That's very solicitous, but quite unnecessary.
I'm helping myself now.
How, Guy?
How?
Come inside. I'll show you.
This is it... my grand plan.
What shall it be?
Some liqueur, brandy, amontillado?
Guy, I brought...
Now, let us drink to something appropriate...
To death.
Not drinking?
What a pity.
It's really quite good.
Guy.
Yes, my dear?
You wish to say something?
No.
Well, in that case... let me tell you about my latest addition.
I thought of it the night before last.
Of course, it's highly unlikely I shall ever use it... but one never knows, does one?
Permits of easy egress... and it's completely impassable from the outside.
A simple arrangement,
I grant, but effective.
Guy, this is madness.
Madness? It's the only
Sane ansWer to my problem.
I'll show you just how mad I am.
I suppose she's told you my father was a cataleptic?
No, but that doesn't mean that...
And I am prone to the same affliction.
Very well.
Let us consider the following.
Apropos of nothing at all,
I have an attack.
Let us say it happens during dinner.
Emily sends Judson to fetch a doctor.
The doctor arrives, he examines me... and pronounces me dead.
I am, of course, alive.
You know the nature of catalepsy.
But to the rest of the world, I am gone... passed on, deceased.
So a funeral is held... and I'm brought down here to this vault... and placed in this coffin.
The mourners have departed... the doors are both locked... and I'm alone.
Now, pay close attention.
Now, the slightest movement of my finger... caused that to happen.
I am now free of the casket... but I'm still capable of only slight effort.
So...
"But", you say, "supposing no one hears the bell"?
The departing mourners lock both the doors.
But is that really foolproof?
What if the gate should stick?
You see?
But, of course, it's barely possible... that all these methods might fail.
So...
But tools break, too, don't they?
A recent invention by a Swedish chemist named Nobel.
It's called dynamite.
It's an explosive.
But how can one be sure the stuff will work?
One can't, of course.
So... one has a bit of food...
Something to drink... every five or ten minutes or so... rings the bell.
Reads a periodical or perhaps a book.
In the event the strain becomes too great... one can avail oneself with the soothing effects of music.
And then one simply waits.
Rather well thought out, don't you think?
But no plan is ever perfect.
So now comes the "piece de resistance"... or perhaps one should say the "coup de grace".
What is it, Guy?
What is it?
The cure for all suffering.
The answer to all problems.
The key, my darling, to heaven... or to hell... or to nothingness.
Poison.
Thank you, Judson.
Tea is ready in the dining room, milady.
Thank you.
How do you explain it, Miles?
Well, I don't just yet.
However, I venture to guess... that the episode at the cemetery... changed the general fear into a specific obsession.
Then... you don't think it's catalepsy?
He's never had these attacks before, has he?
I mean, fainting spells, dizzy spells?
No. No.
But his father...
To the best of our knowledge... catalepsy is not an inherited affliction.
And there's a new line of thought... among some of us... myself, Cargrave, and a few others... that may shed some light on Guy's case.
You see... most people tend to think of the body... and the mind as being totally different... two separate entities...
Whereas, in point of fact... they're actually linked.
No sugar.
Do you follow me?
Yes, I think so.
You see, physically...
Guy may be perfectly sound now.
However, this constant fear... that gnaws at him night and day... may actually bring about a condition of catalepsy...
Where no such condition exists now.
I see.
Well, what can be done?
I am not sure.
I'm not sure at all.
However, I do know this... that Guy's mind is like a keg of gunpowder... and the smallest thing might set the fuse... the most innocent reminder of death... corpses, graves, anything at all.
That's the first thing you must remember.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
Oh, Miles, I wish you could come and stay with us.
Well, I was just thinking.
The laboratory downstairs.
What about it?
Well, you may know that Guy offered me the use of it... in order to further my researches.
If I accepted his offer...
I might be able to come here from time to time.
Oh, Miles, that would be absolutely wonderful!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Well, I must go now, but I'll be back.
And remember, the smallest thing.
Don't forget.
I won't forget.
Dear Emily.
Frog, please, Judson.
Yes, sir.
Your frog, sir.
Oh, put him down here, please.
Now, if we place one terminal of the galvanic battery... in contact with the nerve... and the other in contact with muscle...
We cause a contraction of the muscle.
There.
You see?
Now, if you could control the responses... of the human mind as easily as you control... the muscles of a frog...
I might have some faith in your work.
Someday, we may be able to... if we continue our research.
And if you were to continue your work...
No, no, no, no.
You know, I think you should make an effort... to take your mind off your fears.
You should get away from this place.
Take Emily to Venice.
Then when you return... most of your problem would have disappeared.
Perhaps you're right.
I'll think about it.
Don't think about it. Do it.
I may. MeanWhile...
I'll leave you to your little friends.
Do you wish to continue, sir?
Hmm?
Oh, yes, Judson.
You and Miles were right.
I do have to get outside occasionally.
I told you.
All we need is each other.
We need nothing else to be happy.
How true.
How true that really is.
What is it?
Listen!
What's the matter, Guy?
That whistling.
I don't hear anything.
Listen, I tell you!
Guy!
Guy, don't run away!
Guy!
Guy!
Darling! Darling, what's wrong?
I saw them.
You saw whom?
Those two filthy grave robbers.
They were coming for me.
Ask Emily.
She saw them, too.
No. I saw no one.
But you must have.
They passed right by us.
Surely you heard them.
Guy, you're overwrought.
I... please.
They were coming for me.
No one questions your word, Guy.
Don't humor me! I'm not mad!
I saw them as clearly as I'm seeing you!
Darling, let's go back to the house... and you can rest, and... well... then you can talk.
Come on.
You didn't see them?
No.
It was dark and foggy.
I'll join you downstairs in a little while.
I just want to rest some more.
All right, darling.
We'll all be waiting for you.
How is he, Emily?
Well, he's better, I think.
- He's resting.
- Good.
What do you think he saw, Miles?
Exactly what he said... the two grave robbers.
Well, then why didn't I see them?
Because they weren't real.
You mean, they were
Something supernatural?
I don't deny the possibility of the supernatural.
However, I do believe... that there's a more logical explanation.
You see, Emily, the human mind...
Well, it's a remarkable instrument.
It can create something out of nothing... and that's probably what happened.
Well...
What you're trying to say is that...
Guy is mad.
No. Nothing of the sort.
He's disturbed, and there's a difference.
If his father was prematurely interred...
He wasn't.
How do you know?
I know because
I went to the crypt... and saw for myself.
My father rests in peace.
It's the wind.
- Guy!
- He's there!
There's nobody there.
But you must have seen him!
I saw only you, Guy.
Miles, what are we going to do?
Ever since that night on the moors, he's been...
Well, I just don't recognize him anymore.
Have you asked him to go away with you?
How can I?
He won't come out of that terrible place... and won't let me in.
All he wants to do is just sit and brood.
Miles, you've got to do something.
Emily, I'm afraid
I've done all I can.
Someday, treatment of the mind...
Will be a science... and they'll be able to cope with such problems.
But at this present stage...
Emily, there is one thing we haven't tried.
Well, just tell me what to do.
Guy?
Guy, let me in.
Well, this is quite a surprise.
Is there any purpose to this visit... apart, that is, from interrupting my work?
Yes.
I thought you'd given up painting.
It's merely portraiture.
Let us say I'm entering a new period.
May I see it?
I don't think you'd find it very pleasing.
Surely I should be the one to decide that.
Very well. Don't say
I didn't warn you.
I call it "some sonsummations devoutly to be wished".
But why?
Think.
All these dreadful tortures you see depicted here... the rack and the stake... the whole ghastly catalog... are they not indeed devoutly to be wished... preferred to that fate which is the most terrible of all?
That fate has already come to pass, Guy.
What are you talking about?
About you.
You don't fear burial alive... because you are already buried alive.
What is it you're afraid of?
Being locked in a tomb?
Why, you've been locked in a tomb for months.
This tomb!
And I've been your widow... and I don't like being your widow, Guy.
And what's more, I'm not going to be much longer.
Emily!
No, Guy. I'm here to give you a choice.
You can have this... this living death... or you can have me... but you can't have both.
Emily, please.
I love you, Guy.
I love you very much... and I want to take care of you... but as long as you're here, I can't.
No one can.
I realize that, but...
I'm so afraid.
Oh, you needn't be, my darling.
I promise you.
Look at me.
I promise you that no matter what happens...
I'll never let them take you down to that... that horrible crypt.
Trust me to take care of you.
I do trust you, Emily, but it isn't that.
Guy, if you do choose me... then you must destroy this evil vault.
Wipe it off the face of the earth... and out of your mind forever!
If you don't... then I shall never see you again.
Well, which is it to be?
Death by yourself... or life with me?
Emily!
Please forgive me, darling.
I wouldn't lose you.
I just couldn't.
Not for anything.
Oh, Guy, I love you.
Guy, that took great courage.
No. Once again,
I was motivated by fear... fear of losing something more valuable than my life.
You'll never regret it.
I pray God you're right.
I want to thank you both for asking me to the ceremony.
I suppose that now you'll be having that honeymoon, huh?
Yes, but first there will be a small party Friday night.
You will be with us,
Miles, won't you?
If your father doesn't take it into his mind... to keep me working at the hospital.
Oh, he won't, because we shall invite both of you.
Well, then, of course, in that case.
Lady Catherine?
Milord?
Thank you, Judson.
My friends, to life.
Dr. Gault, would you like a cigar?
Oh. Thank you. Yes.
- Join us, Miles?
- In just a moment.
It's extraordinary,
Lady Catherine... but he looks the picture of health... don't you agree?
Looks can be deceiving,
Dr. Archer.
Thank you.
Well, permit me to offer my congratulations... on your lordship's recovery.
I think you should offer them to Emily and to Miles.
They are responsible.
Well, Father, are you enjoying yourself?
I never enjoy myself.
I merely experience greater and lesser... degrees of tedium, that's all.
It's just the cat, darling.
Yes, I know... but why should
She cry like that?
Hungry, I expect.
Where is she?
I don't know.
Sounds as if it's coming from over there.
Poor little thing must be stuck.
Wait a moment.
Down here.
Look at that.
It's down here.
Down here.
There it is.
All right, old girl.
We'll have you out in a moment.
However could she have got behind there?
It must have crawled through.
Let me have the poor wee thing.
There, now.
What a thing to happen.
There, you see?
No harm done after all.
There. She's all right.
Guy, are you all right?
What if we hadn't heard her?
But we did hear her.
You haven't put these thoughts... out of your mind after all, have you?
Oh, of course he has.
This is just a sort of...
You haven't, have you?
Guy, you've got to put it out of your mind.
I've tried.
I've tried everything.
Not everything.
Guy, your fear of catalepsy is based on your belief... that your father was prematurely buried.
Isn't that correct?
I heard him. I heard his voice.
You think you heard it.
I heard his voice!
All right, then prove it.
What do you mean?
Just that... prove it.
Take me down to the crypt and show me his body.
I can't.
Because you know it isn't true.
- No!
- Yes.
Why else do you think you've avoided it?
Because you're afraid... afraid that this fear... is nothing more than a trick of your mind.
I'd give anything to find out if that were true.
All right, then take me downstairs.
All right.
I will.
No. Guy, don't you think you should rest?
Emily, Miles is right.
I've put this off long enough.
The key to the crypt... it's gone.
Who has access to these?
No one but myself.
But do you keep it locked?
No, but...
Guy, did you come down here and take the key?
I don't think so.
Is it possible for someone to do... a thing like that and not remember it?
It's possible.
You admit to doing... many things lately that you don't remember.
Well, it's unimportant.
We'll break it open.
Follow me.
Which one is it?
Over there.
I can't.
You must.
It's your only chance.
If you fail now, you'll be haunted forever.
Kate, bring me a mirror.
You're wasting your time.
He's dead.
No. No, he can't be.
He can't be.
He's finished. Heart attack.
Oh, no!
Are you sure, Dr. Gault?
Of course I am.
No, there's no sign of life, but to be absolutely sure...
We should make one more test.
Foolishness, Archer.
The man's dead.
Judson, help me with the galvanic battery.
No, don't do this.
Listen to me. I'm alive.
Can't you hear me?
I'm alive! I'm alive!
Uh, Kate, you and Emily had better leave the room.
Miles.
Miles! In the name of heaven!
Well? Is he dead or isn't he?
He is.
No. I'm not dead.
I'm alive!
Judson, help me with the battery.
We may as well take him back to the crypt.
No. I promised him that no matter what happens...
I'd never let them take him down to the crypt.
Nonsense, Emily.
Oh, well. It's your decision.
Man that is born of woman... hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery.
He cometh up and is cut down like a flower.
He fleeth as it were a shadow... and never continueth in one stay.
In the midst of life, we are in death.
Of whom may we seek for succor but of thee, dear Lord...
Who, for our sins, art justly displeased?
Yet, oh Lord God most mighty...
Oh holy and most merciful savior... deliver us not into the bitter pain of eternal death.
Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts.
Shut not thy merciful ears to thy prayers... but spare us, God most mighty.
O most merciful savior, thou most worthy judge eternal... suffer us not at our last hour... for any pains of death to fall from thee.
Suffer us not.
Pains of death.
Oh, please, help me!
Someone, help me.
Help me!
Amen.
You may say farewell now.
Good-bye, my darling.
Emily.
Emily, come back.
Come back!
They'll see me.
They'll look at my eyes.
They're not taking me to the crypt.
But... Where are they taking me?
Where? where?
Why can't I move?
Oh, God, why can't I move?
O merciful God...
We consign the soul of Guy Carrell... son of Gideon and Agatha Carrell... to thine eternal care.
Amen.
Look at me!
Someone, look at me!
Oh, for God's sake, please!
You can't bury me alive!
Can't you see I'm alive?
God, why can't I move? why can't I move?
No. No!
Help me.
Someone, help me!
I'm alive!
Can't you hear me?
Can't you see my eyes?
I'm alive! Alive! Ali...
You'll be leaving, I suppose... after the reading of the will.
Why should you say that?
No reason. I merely thought that under the circumstances... you might find this house rather disturbing.
To your conscience, I mean.
Kate, are you implying... that Emily is in any way responsible for Guy's death?
No one is responsible.
He died of a heart attack induced by shock.
Don't you understand?
Yes. I understand.
The fact is, he brought on the shock himself.
The episode in the crypt and all the others... they were planned, contrived.
Don't you see?
Planned? By whom?
By Guy himself.
In a strange way, he wanted to die.
Stop talking about him!
That's a bit much,
Mr. Sweeney.
What is, Mr. Mole?
The old gentleman sending us out here to dig up this one.
I mean, his own son-in-law!
Well, one stiff's pretty much like another.
Oh, we've struck wood.
Now, where's the bloody crowbar?
I believe I left it up on top.
Well, Mr. Mole, would you do me the kindness to fetch it down?
Yes, I will, Mr. Sweeney.
I found it, Mr. Sweeney!
Huh? No!
No! I never did nothing to you!
Please! Please!
I've never done nothing to you. Please!
Sweeney! You blithering idiot! what did you...
I told you to take him to my quarters.
Oh, well. May as well have a look at him now.
Yes.
Ironic, don't you think?
And rather fitting, really.
In life, Guy Carrell contributed nothing to medical science.
In death, he shall
Serve it admirably.
Sweeney?
No! You're dead! No!
Emily, there's nothing whatever wrong with you.
Well, not physically, perhaps.
Then why did you send
Judson for me? Hmm?
Well, I was afraid to be alone.
Well, I can understand that.
Perhaps you shouldn't be here.
Oh, Miles, don't you see that...
Please come and sit down.
Please?
Now, just for a moment, and then you must go to sleep.
Miles, you must know... or at least you must sense that...
I've been very worried today... that I'm in need of something or someone to give me solace.
You and I were very close once, Miles.
You remember that, don't you?
I can remember a medical student...
Who was poor as a church mouse... and a girl who wanted to be a great lady.
I was very foolish.
Oh, Miles... maybe it's not too late for us.
But, Emily...
I made a mistake.
Is that so very wrong?
Come in!
Dr. Archer.
What is it, Judson?
It's... excuse me, milady.
It's something I'd like you to see, sir... if you would.
- A medical matter?
- Yes.
Then certainly Dr. Gault could take care of it.
I think Dr. Gault would want you to come... as quickly as possible, sir.
Perhaps you had better go, Miles.
Now, come along, Judson.
Judson, why are you behaving so oddly?
I heard a sound from the laboratory, sir... just a bit ago, and...
Yes?
See for yourself, sir.
Who's that?
Miles?
No welcome?
No rejoicing?
No kiss?
He's been killed by electrical force.
Dr. Archer!
That's Sweeney.
Emily.
Emily?
Guy.
Now...
Guy, you've got to listen to me.
To what? More lies? More deceit?
More treachery?
No, no. That's not true.
Oh, but it is.
You were very clever, Emily.
Very clever.
In a way, I'm sorry to spoil your plans.
Oh, I had no plans.
It was Kate.
You... you wouldn't kill me, would you, Guy?
No, darling, not at all... just as you didn't kill me.
You wouldn't soil your pretty hands with murder.
No, you just stood aside and let them bury me alive!
No, Guy! No!
And so... I shall not kill you.
That sorry task I shall leave to the earth... and the darkness... and the terrified pounding of your own heart.
Guy, no! Not that!
Yes, my beautiful, my perfidious... my treacherous love... that.
No, Guy!
Guy!
Stay precisely where you are, Miles.
I've no desire to harm you.
What have you done, Guy?
Paid a debt of long standing.
No!
This has nothing to do with you.
I found that out earlier this evening.
In heaven's name, Guy!
Yes... in heaven's name.
Give me that shovel!
She's dead!
Thank God.
Kate, what are you saying?
Are you so blind?
Can't you see?
That's the key to the crypt.
She had no time to replace it.
I can't believe it. Not Emily.
Yes. Emily.
Sweet, beautiful, gentle Emily.
Once you told her how easy it would be... to use Guy's fear to kill him, she went to work.
First, the hiring of the grave robbers... to torment him... the cat in the wall... and finally the desecration of our father's tomb.
Oh, Guy!
I knew what she was doing... and I wanted to tell you... but you wouldn't have believed me.
I had to wait for proof.
You can see that, can't you?
But I waited too long.
I was too late.
Too late.
SHOCHIKU COMPANY, LTD
What's this all about?
I've never seen the sky this colour before.
It's just like flying through a sea of blood.
Ladies and gentlemen, this plane will pass Oshima and Suzuka and reach Itami Airport at 5:40 p.m.
A drink?
No thanks.
"BRITISH AMBASSADOR
ASSASSINATED WITH RIFLE"
Mr. Mano, Japan's becoming like America, isn't it?
What do you mean by that?
Using a rifle to kill people.
It's a pity to have lost such a fine man.
The Ambassador was trying his best to find a way to settle the trouble in Southeast Asia.
Tokuyasu, do you really mean what you're saying?
What...?
Your company exports weapons.
Won't you be in trouble if peace comes to Southeast Asia?
Isn't that so, Mrs. Tokuyasu?
Yes.
What are you talking about, Noriko?
I'm no match foryou, Mr. Mano.
The world's in a terrible shape.
Trouble between nations grows worse with terrorism breaking out all overthe place.
Everything's gone crazy!
You should get yourself a bodyguard, Mr. Mano.
You must take care.
You can't tell who your enemies are.
Nonsense! I'm not afraid to die.
A politician who fears his enemies would end up a nervous wreck.
Flight JA 307 here. Over.
We just received a report that there may be a bomb on the plane.
The suspect may try to commit suicide.
He wrote to Police HQ saying he would blow up the plane.
Return to Haneda Airport at once.
I repeat. Return at once!
Roger!
Check everyone's bags.
And quickly!
Yes, sir!
Ladies and gentlemen. We have to perform a check of your bags.
Please have your bags open and ready for inspection.
Please.
Thank you very much.
Why are you checking our bags?
The control tower contacted us.
It seems that the bag of a passenger taking the next plane was loaded on here by mistake.
What sort of bag?
We aren't sure. They didn't tell us.
Have you the right to open other people's bags?
This is Mr. Mano of the Kenmin Party.
It's extremely ill mannered!
I don't mind. Go ahead, if you must.
But...
Thank you.
Excuse me, sir.
Were there important papers or something in the missing bag?
Or was it a bomb?
What?
It's the fad nowadays to plant bombs on planes or trains to blow them up.
Isn't that it?
There's no bomb!
In that case, everything's alright.
Is what he said true?
No, sir.
It's not true? It's a mistake?
Yes. Important company papers are in the bag. That's all.
Please cooperate with us.
Don't talk nonsense!
What's so funny about frightening people?
I'm a psychiatrist, my friend.
I like to study the reaction of people driven to the limit of their endurance.
You should get your own head checked out.
Please.
The suicide of a bird.
So it's not just human beings?
Do birds lose the will to live?
No. It's not that at all.
The birds are frightened.
I wonder why.
Something extremely unusual is happening.
Extremely unusual?
Birds are sensitive creatures.
I can't think that this is a natural phenomenon.
Thank you.
Your bag, sir?
I don't have any.
What?
Mr. Sugisaka.
Get me a screwdriver. I'll open it.
But if it's a bomb, when you open it, it might...
We can't leave it as it is.
It's a rifle, not a bomb.
Whose is it?
Only one man didn't have a bag.
It must belong to him!
You shouldn't meddle with things.
Who told the police about a bomb?
Dunno.
What'll you do now?
What're you doing?
Now, you can't contact anyone.
Change your course to Okinawa.
I refuse!
You can't refuse.
The lives of the passengers are in my hands.
Change your course.
A flying object has been sighted.
There is every indication that it intends to invade Japan's airspace.
The Japanese Defence Force and the US Air Force are in pursuit.
A warning has been issued to all planes to avoid its flight path...
What's that?

Miss Asakura!
Miss Asakura!
Are you okay? We're alive.
There may be more survivors.
Let's check.
Yes.
Mr. Tokuyasu. Are you okay?
Mrs. Neal!
Mrs. Neal!
Are you hurt?
Anything broken?
Just stay calm.
Mr. Mano! Mr. Mano! Wake up!
You're safe. You're okay.
Are we the only ones alive?
How's your wife?
Um... I haven't checked yet.
Fool!
Mrs. Tokuyasu! Wake up!
Mrs. Tokuyasu!
Mrs. Tokuyasu!
Mr. Mano!
How do you feel?
Are you hurt?
Are you hurt?
What're you doing out there?
Damn. He saw me!
It's dangerous outside!
Come back at once!
It's dangerous! Come back!
Come back!
Wait for me!
Wait!
Wait!
Watch out!
Are you trying to kill yourself?
It was you, wasn't it?
Where's the bomb?
Dunno.
You know.
Tell me.
Where is it?
I never had a bomb in the first place.
It was just a joke...
I lied in my letter to the Police.
There's no bomb.
Why did you do it?
Why?
There's no fun in this world.
Are we the only ones alive?
You! Contact the Haneda
Control Tower at once.
I'm afraid I can't.
That gunman wrecked the radio.
What's that?
Where are we, anyway?
I don't know.
You don't know?
We started to return to Haneda, but he forced us to change course.
So I've no idea where we are.
Listen, I'm a busy man!
Do something about it!
What're you going to do?
Don't you have any bright ideas?
We can't waste time.
The General Election is coming up.
I understand, but we'll have to wait forthe rescue team.
And what are we supposed to do in the meantime?
Now look. Are you sure a rescue team will be here by tomorrow?
I hope so.
That's not good enough!
Not one plane has passed over while we've been here.
But a rescue party's bound to come.
I'm sure of it.
I don't believe it.
Don't just stand there.
You caused the plane to crash.
Now find a way out of this mess.
It wasn't our fault.
The gauges went wild, that's why we crashed.
Faulty gauges?
What rubbish!
Birds acting strangely... faulty gauges...
We saw something. A weird light.
A light?
It flew right over the plane.
It was blinding.
Then the plane crashed after that?
Yes.
Don't try to get out of it.
You're responsible for the crash.
It's true!
Who's going to believe such fantasies?
No, we can't write it off as fantasies.
There are things in this universe that mankind does not understand yet.
You can't deny that.
What planet are you from?
What line of work are you in?
I'm a researcher in space biology.
No wonder you've got such weird theories.
It's hot.
Where's the water?
That's the only water we have.
There's nothing else to drink?
No, there isn't.
You used all the water?
I'm crazy! Need water!
Stop it!
It's all becoming very interesting.
As a psychiatrist, I should benefit a great deal from what happens next.
What are you talking about?
No water, and nothing to eat.
What happens to people in times like this?
Everyone wants to live, so we shed our civilised veneer.
Then we cease to be human beings.
We become beasts!
The weak become the victims of the strong - the law of the jungle.
In the end, everyone dies.
We can't hang around here.
Mr. Mano, let's get going.
Please wait! It's dangerous outside!
Move aside!
Wait until morning!
We're going. You can wait if you want.
Mr. Mano, isn't it important forthe nine of us to cooperate?
If we keep bickering, we'll ruin our chances of survival.
Please understand what I'm saying.
Shut up and stand aside!
Stop it!
Move!
No!
Move, I said!
Please understand!
Move when I say so!
Move!
If you're going to shoot, shoot.
What are you waiting for? Shoot him!
If you don't, he'll kill us!
Give me the gun!
Drop the gun!
What are you?
"BRITISH AMBASSADOR
ASSASSINATED WITH RIFLE"
Then you killed the Ambassador?
Who paid you to do it?
I don't know anything about it!
What's that?
Miss Asakura!
Miss Asakura!
Miss Asakura!
Miss Asakura!
Miss Asakura!
What happened?
I'm afraid!
What did you see?
Miss Asakura!
What do you want?
Mr. Mano, you must be tired.
I found some whisky. You have it.
Mr. Tokuyasu, we're digging graves for the dead.
Why not dig your own grave too?
Gasoline! It's dangerous!
Where was she?
Where did he go?
Isn't that his rifle?
I found it on a ledge but he wasn't around.
He wouldn't run away leaving a hostage and his gun.
Could he have fallen off the cliff?
Tell me, what happened to him?
Where is he?
Tell us! Where is he?
What're you doing?
...next the news.
The jetliner that vanished today has still not been found.
Rescue planes found no traces of the missing plane.
It is feared that there may be no survivors of this strange incident.
When we have any further news' we'll broadcast it without delay...
The fool!
How dare he say we're all dead!
Damn it!
Okay. The rescue party isn't coming.
We can't stay here. Let's go.
There's a murderer outside.
He's hungry for blood.
What'll we do then?
In order to save ourselves, we must first find out what's become of him.
We don't even know where he is.
She's so frightened she can't speak.
There's nothing we can do.
Make her talk.
Make her talk? How?
Go to sleep.
Into a deep sleep.
Deeper.
Just relax.
Keep looking into the flame.
You're so tired and the flame brings you sleep.
You're sleeping deeply now.
Just remember what you saw.
Tell me what you saw.
So, try to remember what happened.
You saw something which frightened you.
Tell me everything about this terrifying thing.
What was it?
You're remembering?
So, tell me. Will you?
What happened to that man?
Now, open your eyes.
You can answer my questions.
Try to remember what happened to the man who took you off the plane.
What did you see out there?
It shines!
It's blinding!
It shines. What is it?
The light makes a noise?
And then what?
It went out.
Where? Where did it go out?
It shines! It's blinding!
I know that.
What happened after that?
Did the man go into the light?
You saw something.
What did you see?
What happened when he went into the light?
I'm afraid!
You saw it?
Now, tell me.
Tell me.
What is it that you are so afraid of?
Wound!
Was he wounded?
Inside the wound!
Miss Asakura! Is that true?
It's a lie!
I don't believe it.
She's lying!
That's right. It must be a lie!
I don't want to believe it, but it's true.
What blinding light? Impossible!
No, it's possible.
The light she saw... I imagine it could have been a flying saucer.
Flying saucer?
I see.
So that's what that light was.
The same thing that caused our crash.
Nonsense!
Flying saucers don't exist.
There's no evidence for them.
You're wrong.
What?
What you say is a mistake.
People have seen flying saucers in many parts of the world.
We can't deny it.
So what?
Since the A-bomb was dropped in Hiroshima, there has been an increase in the number of flying saucers.
It seems that while man destroys, slaughtering his fellow man in senseless wars, space creatures plan to invade.
What's she saying?
She says war's absolutely unacceptable.
Her husband, who's been fighting in Vietnam, died a week ago.
She was on her way to the US base in Iwakuni for her husband's remains.
What're you doing?
Why'd you have to go and do that?
To find out what happened.
Shut up! We were better off not knowing! You shouldn't...
It's too late to say that now.
You all agreed to it, didn't you?
Tell me. What she said was all lies, wasn't it?
It's the truth!
All lies! They have to be!
Tell me they're lies!
What she said is true. It's the truth.
What?
You scum!
What're you doing?
You pushed him off, didn't you?
No! I didn't do it!
Liar!
Let's lock the murderer up!
No! I didn't do it!
Listen to me!
Open the door!
I didn't do anything! I didn't do it!
Let me out of here!
Open the door!
Let me out!
I can't stand it I here!
I'll go mad!
What's all that noise?
Something really frightened you?
Something happened to me?
Yes. You had a nightmare.
Forget all about it.
Don't let it get you down. Be strong.
We're going to live no matter what happens.
Is it morning yet?
Water! Isn't there a drop of water?
Mr. Mano. You're not the only one who wants water.
Please hold out until morning.
Stop it!
Whisky will only burn your throat.
Is it the wind?
No, it's not the wind.
It may be Mr. Momotake.
He can't be alive. Don't open it.
Mr. Momotake!
Mr. Momotake, is that you?
What's she saying?
She says she can't let him lie there.
What?
His wound reminds her of how her husband died.
A napalm bomb ripped open her husband's face.
Sugisaka, are you out of your mind?
Please move aside.
There's no telling what he'll do if we let him in!
Look. He came back to ask for help.
And he doesn't have a gun, now.
He's wounded.
Saga. Please help me.
He's dead.
A deep wound like that, and yet no blood.
What's the reason?
I've got a bad feeling.
Find anything out?
No.
Something inconceivable is about to happen.
Birds killing themselves, that strange light, flying saucers and now that gaping wound on his face.
Something we can't imagine is in control.
Stop pretending to be a prophet!
Water's more important!
Give me water!
Mr. Mano. There's still a drop of whisky left.
What?
That's what you get for drinking too much whisky.
Tokuyasu!
You knew drinking whisky would only make you thirstier, didn't you?
Well, you'll just have to bear it.
You offered Mr. Mano whisky on purpose?
You wanted to enjoy seeing him suffer, didn't you?
Bastard!
Stop it!
If we keep on quarrelling like this, we'll never get out of here.
Somebody, get me some water!
Before I die!
Tokuyasu, get me some water, and I'll seriously think about giving you that government contract.
Seriously?
Then you weren't really considering giving it to us before?
I see.
I thought as much.
I wanted to know what you really thought.
That's why I offered you the whisky.
You rat!
The only reason you approached our company in the first place was to get us to give you money.
Tokuyasu, this is no place to say such things!
I don't give a damn who hears it.
You've accepted nearly one billion yen from my company!
I gave you plenty in return!
Your company was going bankrupt.
Now it's one of the richest in Japan.
Who do you have to thank for that?
Don't make it sound like you did us a favour.
You owed us much more than that!
Tokuyasu. You'd be nothing without me!
Tokuyasu!
Give it to me! Please!
Give me that water! Please!
Mr. Tokuyasu, give him the water.
Please! Don't be so cruel, give it.
Do you want this, Mr. Mano?
If you want it, you'll tell everyone the reason you were going to Osaka.
But that's...
I approached you to make money.
I even threw in my wife as a treat.
Now tell them your half of the deal.
Come on, speak!
You tricked me and now you'll pay.
Stop it! Don't do that!
Now, Mr. Mano. Tell them.
Now. Say it nice and loud.
Stay where you are!
I'll say it then.
You were coming with me to Osaka to receive thirty million yen from my company.
That's the truth!
And in return you were to pressure the government so they would buy all their weapons from my company.
It was all a pack of lies.
You had no intention of keeping your word to us.
Wouldn't the voters laugh if they saw you now?
Tokuyasu!
When we get out of here, you're through!
I'll see that you're ruined for life!
You see if I don't!
Mr. Tokuyasu, don't be foolish!
Don't move!
Outside!
Don't be foolish!
Shut up!
Go!
Get out!
Out!
Okay.
You too!
Get out!
Stay back!
What're you going to do?
Stop it!
Stop it, I say!
Tokuyasu!
Tokuyasu!
Don't look.
Please go back to the cabin.
The blood's gone.
It's all been drained from his body.
What?
Mrs. Tokuyasu.
It's his punishment.
He sold his own wife, just to get ahead in business.
He deserved to die like that.
You despise me, don't you?
No, that's no true.
I don't care what anyone thinks.
After all these years,
I've escaped from his grip forever.
I'm free at long last.
Now I can do whatever I want.
It's hot, isn't it?
Shouldn't it be dawn soon?
He caused me such pain.
He shouldn't have had to die in this terrible way.
Saga.
Saga, you know what caused this.
Please tell us.
No, I don't.
I have no idea.
You do.
You're keeping something from us.
Just a guess.
Only conjecture.
I'll most likely be proved wrong.
If I say what I think, it'll only upset everyone for no reason.
I see. I still want to know.
Why was he killed in that way?
To be drained of blood. Tell me why!
Noriko!
Mrs. Tokuyasu!
Noriko!
Mrs. Tokuyasu!
Noriko!
Mr. Mano, did you find her?
No.
Let's search over there.
Hey, Noriko!
Noriko!
Noriko!
Noriko!
Noriko!
Noriko!
Wait there.
Earth people.
You cannot understand us so we are talking through her.
We are the Gokemidoro people.
We live in a universe far from Earth.
We've marked Earth for a long time and we have now raided it.
Our plan is to wipe out all of mankind.
The end has come and mankind is on the verge of destruction.
It is your own fault that we have chosen you for annihilation.
You have already turned your world into a monstrous battlefield.
Noriko!
Noriko!
How terrible.
She was brainwashed.
Nonsense!
The aliens brainwashed her to convey their will to us.
That's enough!
You're lucky to be so blind.
You saw that terrible thing happen, and you still don't believe it.
Saga. Don't hide the truth.
Tell us.
Explain what happened to Noriko.
I believe in the existence of aliens.
You think there are such things?
There are theories about these creatures.
They possess a high intellectual standard, that much we know.
They're also scientifically advanced.
Or else they'd never have crafts capable if interplanetary flight.
They've been seen in many parts of the world.
I think they've been gathering in preparation for their attack.
Now they've chosen the moment and begun their attack.
That's absurd!
Even with proof, mankind refuses to believe in them.
They prefer to ignore this threat from alien invaders.
Instead, they fight each other.
The space men must be pleased.
We've made it easy for them.
These creatures know that their best chance is when men are preoccupied with killing each other.
Mankind doesn't stop to think before it takes action.
He was right. The Gokemidoro said we'd be destroyed.
But we don't need any outside help to bring it about.
What rot! Talk some sense!
Mano!
You saw what happened out there.
Death caused by a vampire.
Aliens have taken over his mind.
And yet you still don't believe it.
Listen.
Intellectuals always try to mislead people by talking loads of rubbish.
Mr. Mano. How can we make you understand?
I'll believe it when I see a vampire with my own two eyes.
But even then...
I'd like to see one suck blood too.
Eh?
I'll never get a chance like this again.
As a scientist, it would be invaluable.
I must see it.
Well, that's interesting.
Let's experiment and see.
How can we?
There's an easy way.
Pick a victim.
That's crazy!
One will die to save the rest.
Human sacrifice has gone on for centuries.
I agree with Mr. Mano.
I want to see it.
Sacrificing human lives?
Have you both gone mad?
Science and governments make progress at the cost of many lives.
That's a fact that can't be denied.
Mr. Saga!
Tell Mrs. Neal that she can join her late husband.
No! I won't let you murder her.
She's a foreigner.
No trouble later.
I won't tell her.
Mr. Mano, you call yourself a human being?
Then you be the victim.
Water! Please!
Please. Give me water!
We'll throw him out.
Get away, watch out!
Mrs. Neal!
Mrs. Neal!
Get in the cockpit.
Hurry!
Get in.
Get in!
Sugisaka!
What're you doing?
Hey! Let me go!
Don't leave me!
I can't believe it.
I can't believe in anything any more.
Sugisaka.
Mrs. Neal is afraid.
I know that.
Still, there are limits to what a person should do.
Let me in!
Let me in!
Let me in!
The bomb!
So.
The bomb's been there all the time.
Open up!
If you don't, I'll blow up the plane!
Stay away!
Stay away!
Stay away!
Watch out!
My legs!
My legs are hurt!
Saga!
We can't waste any more time.
Let's get going!
What about Mr. Saga?
We'd better leave him behind.
What?
Let's get out of here.
Please stay.
My friend. Don't worry.
I won't leave you here.
Thank you.
You go. I'll make a stretcher.
We'll follow you.
You're fools!
Mano!
Hurry!
Ah! It's him!
Well now, we can leave pretty soon.
I'm sorry to be a burden to you.
It serves me right.
I did the worst thing a human being could do.
No wonder I was punished for it.
You go on. I'll only slow you down.
What are you saying?
We're not going to let those creatures get you.
You know, I'd lost all faith in my fellow man.
But by being with you two,
I feel there's still some hope left for humanity.
Listen.
Don't lose hope.
Otherwise life would be unbearable.
Yes, that's true.
We must believe in each other.
Help me, please!
Please help me!
Someone, help!
Help me!
Mano!
What're you doing?
Mr. Mano!
Mr. Mano!
Mr. Mano!
Mr. Mano!
What kind of a beast are you?
Miss Asakura, run!
Miss Asakura!
Mr. Sugisaka!
So he's dead now.
I'm safe at last.
If we stay here, I'll be too late for the general election.
Let's go.
Hey.
Say something.
What are you mad about?
What's bothering you, anyhow?
You're not going to tell everyone when we get back are you?
I suppose you think that you can ruin my entire political career.
Now see here.
This was an abnormal situation.
It's only natural we act strangely.
You were no different to anyone else.
Do you really think that you'd be able to finish my political career?
Who would believe anything that you have to say?
Hey. For god's sake speak up!
Say something!
Say something!
What're you doing?
Let him go.
Hands off!
Hurry, run!
Mr. Mano!
Run!
I don't want to die! Let me live!
He's after us!
Run!
Watch out!
Mr. Sugisaka!
Mr. Sugisaka!
Run! Go on alone!
Mr. Sugisaka!
We're safe, aren't we?
Let's go.
Mr. Sugisaka!
I can't make it.
You must live.
Live no matterwhat happens.
They're dead.
What's happened?
Hey. Excuse me.
Listen now.
We are the Gokemidori from a distant planet.
So beware.
We are going to destroy your entire world.
You are through.
You have arrived at your final day of judgement.
Meet your doom, for not one of you shall survive.
It is too late to wish you had lived differently.
Why did this have to happen?
It's too late.
Mankind is through.
It's too late to repent.
THE END
Grandmother.
Come closer.
Take this to your village... and tell the people... the day of their deliverance is at hand.
Make way for
Prince Prospero!
Get back there!
According to my custom...
I have come here personally... to thank you for the year's harvest...
To make sure we'll starve on what is left.
And to invite you to a feast... to be held in a fortnight... when annually
I gather about me... the nobles of the countryside.
When you'll throw us the scraps from your table... as if we were dogs.
Exactly.
But these dogs have a loud bark... and show their teeth.
Why?
An old woman met a holy man on the hill.
He made a prophecy.
He said the day of our deliverance was at hand.
From your tyranny.
Well, then, shouldn't you be on your knees to give thanks?
Garotte them.
No! I beg of you.
Mercy! Mercy!
Mercy in the name of...
The girl was addressing me.
What is your name?
Francesca.
What do you want of me, Francesca?
Forgive them!
Forgive them!
That is not possible.
They have defied me.
If my hound bites my hand... after I have fed and caressed him... should I allow him to go undisciplined?
Forgive them.
I beg of you.
How innocent you are.
However, I am disposed to temper justice with mercy.
So I will leave it up to you, Francesca.
One must die.
Which one?
One is my father.
The other, the man I love.
You promised me entertainment... but I never hoped for this.
Can such eyes ever have known sin?
They will, Alfredo.
They will.
However, this is not for your entertainment.
Even so, Francesca, you must choose.
One will live, one will die, or both will die.
Silence that.
Well, choose, Francesca.
Which will die?
Choose.
Must I take care of everything myself?
Well, what is it?
Look, sir. Look.
The Red Death.
That old woman was told the prophecy?
- Yes.
- Did you touch her?
- No.
- Or you or you?
Take them to the castle.
- I'll take the girl.
- No!
They may provide us... with some entertainment after all.
To your horses, friends.
Burn the village to the ground.
Why do you burn their homes?
Winter comes.
This is your day of deliverance... remember?
Come on, there.
Come on, hurry up.
Come on, quick.
Come on.
Over there.
Come on, then.
Come on.
Get moving, there.
Quickly, get along.
Come on.
Hurry up!
Couriers, you are to go to my intended guests... to the Duke of Verga, to Verona, Florence... tell them that they are to come here... to my castle without delay...
And if they wish admittance... to avoid the village of Catania... but to come at once.
You will wash.
In my own time.
The prince says now is the time.
I will do nothing until I know about Gino and my father.
Modesty, but no humility.
Gino and my father, where are they?
Why do you hide yourself?
It's not right that you should look at me.
You may go.
That cross you wear around your neck... is it only a decoration... or are you a true
Christian believer?
Yes, I believe.
Truly.
Then I want you to remove it at once... and never to wear it within this castle again.
This peasant girl, is she always to be bathed in my bedroom?
We'll find you another room, Juliana.
Meanwhile, you will dress the Lady Francesca in one of your finest gowns.
I don't...
Later, you can instruct her... in the ways of the court.
Please, my father...
Oh, yes. Your father.
Your father and your lover... are being quartered... in a warm and safe place.
Now I must join my guests.
You may think that... you've impressed the Prince Prospero, but you can count on little help from me.
You will do as he told you.
Yes, as we all must do.
I will do what I must to save my men.
But if they are killed...
I will die and so will Prince Prospero.
Let me speak to you about the anatomy of terror.
Terror?
What would you know of terror, Alfredo?
Your senses are much too blunt.
What is terror?
Come.
Silence.
Listen.
Is it to awaken and hear the passing of time... or is it the failing beat of your own heart?
Or the footsteps of someone who just a moment before... was in your room?
But let us not dwell on terror.
The knowledge of terror is vouchsafed... only to the precious few.
And now may I present for your entertainment... the dancers Esmeralda and Hop Toad.
Wherever did you find her?
Pretty toy, isn't she?
Delightful.
I wonder...
I'm sure you do,
Alfredo.
I'm sure you wonder about every female... in my household... every one with the appearance of innocence.
You seem to take great pleasure... in corrupting it.
I'm not corrupting
Alfredo, no.
Instructing.
If the wench were full-size, she'd drown us all in wine.
Well, my first novelty seems to have failed.
However, on the Sabbath at midnight... for your amusement... there will be a masquerade.
The wardrobes of the castle... are yours to use.
But I beg of you, even for the humor of it, do not wear red.
You go too far.
I am not without influence and power.
Against the Red Death?
Yes.
Yes, it came to the village.
Even now, it lays waste to the countryside.
So you can count yourselves fortunate... that you are here in this castle... under the protection of Prince Prospero.
May I present the Lady Francesca?
Meanwhile, continue with your merrymaking.
Act according to your natures.
Senor Veronese... you do little but eat and swill... and dream of other things.
How like a pig you are.
Be one.
You, Senor Lampredi... you laugh at this poor pig... while you are small and insignificant... no more than a worm.
Can you be a worm,
Lampredi?
Senorita Escobar... do you hear how she laughs?
It is like nothing so much as a braying jackass.
Be one.
You, Senor Rimini, ride that jackass to market.
Giddyap!
As for the rest of you, use your imaginations.
Show me the lives and loves of the animals.
See if we cannot make something... more exotic of her that will appeal to me.
Francesca?
My father imprisoned a friend of his... in this room for 3 years.
When he was released... he could never again bear to look at the sun... or even a daffodil.
How cruel.
Cruel?
It was simply a test... to prove how easily a man's mind... can be controlled and twisted.
My family have always been interested... in such things.
Somewhere in the human mind... my dear Francesca... is the key to our existence.
My ancestors tried to find it... to open the door that separates us... from our creator.
You need no doors to find God.
If you believe...
Believe?
If you believe, my dear Francesca, you are gullible.
Can you look around this world... and believe in the goodness of a god who rules it?
Famine, pestilence, war, disease, and death... they rule this world.
There is also love and life and hope.
Very little hope,
I assure you.
No.
If a god of love and light ever did exist... he is long since dead.
Someone... something... rules in his place.
No.
No, that room is not open to you.
Not yet.
What's in there?
You look as though...
Is there something to fear in that room?
For the uninvited, there is much to fear.
This has been a trying day for you.
You must sleep.
You must sleep.
Tomorrow you may see
Gino and your father.
Prince Prospero.
Why do you roam the late night corridors?
Sleep eludes me.
You have disturbing thoughts?
And you, Juliana... what keeps you awake?
I think my thoughts dwell... on the same subject as you... the peasant girl.
She has a perfect faith.
So do I... in you and in what you believe.
I've been an eager student, but I've held back from the final ceremony.
And now I'm ready to join you at the invocation.
How truly realistic women are.
Finally you are ready to dare... the most terrible rites and incantations... to secure your position here.
I wonder...
I wonder if she is ready to dare... as much or anything for the sake of love.
Did I startle you, my dear?
Watch.
Do you know how a falcon is trained, my dear?
Her eyes are sewn shut.
Blinded temporarily, she suffers the whims of her god patiently... until her will is submerged... and she learns to serve.
Thus your god taught and blinded you with crosses.
You had me take off my cross because it offended...
It offended no one.
My master and his followers look about with open eyes.
No. It simply appeared to me to be discourteous to... to wear the symbol of a deity long dead.
Your master?
Satan.
The lord of flies.
The fallen angel.
The devil.
Come.
Who seeks entrance to Prince Prospero's castle?
Prospero's invited guests.
Open the gate at once.
It is the prince himself... who speaks to you,
Scarlatti.
You are no longer welcome here.
Really?
I know your whims, but...
The village is full of the Red Death.
The Red Death.
Prince Prospero,
I beg you, allow us haven.
I beg sanctuary.
This is no church.
By any god... in all the gods of time,
I beg you.
My wife... you've always thought her beautiful.
And you... you desired her.
I've watched your eyes follow her.
This Scarlatti thought of himself... as a good man in many things.
And he thought of his wife as pure and unassailable.
I give her to you to do with as you please.
I've already had that doubtful pleasure.
Prince, spare me the Red Death.
I beg you in the name of friendship.
In the name of friendship!
No!
For you, friend.
Madam... spare yourself the Red Death.
Pick it up!
We've been ordered to teach you the use of arms.
I will not learn to fight my friend.
Now, don't be a fool.
One of you could survive.
If you fight well, the living one... might be given his freedom.
To live like you?
Like one of
Prospero's pet dogs?
Kill me and Prospero will see you dead... for spoiling his entertainment.
I won't kill you.
I'll just cut you a bit.
Stop them!
Gino knows nothing of fighting.
He learns rather fast.
It is a true fact... that the greatest swordsman in Italy... would not fear the second greatest... but would fear the worst, for that one would be unpredictable.
Francesca!
Are you unharmed?
Yes, Gino. And you?
Scratches given to taunt me to fight... but I will not fight my friend.
You may force me to discipline you... in some other way.
Do what you will.
We will not fight.
And I don't think... you'll give us up to simple torture.
Because if you did... then in a way, you would have lost.
You surprise me.
However,
I'm pleased to find that you've given me a puzzle to think about.
Somehow, you two will challenge death together.
You may be certain of that.
No. This way, my dear.
It would be better.
I understand.
Life is often ugly.
But to torture men!
Is this what your master Satan... demands as worship?
These cells are very old.
A hundred years ago, an ancestor of mine... was a Christian monk.
He was made examiner of an early inquisition.
He tortured over 600 men, women, and children... in order to save their souls... for your god of love.
I cannot answer.
I have no learning.
But then is Satan a god of hate?
Oh, no.
Of reality, of truth.
The world lives in pain and despair... but is at least kept alive... by a few dedicated men.
If we lost our power, chaos would engulf everything.
Sometimes that power must be used... to teach harsh lessons.
But I don't want to learn.
I'm afraid.
I do not want to hurt you, my dear.
Can't you understand?
I want to help save your soul... so you can join me in the glories of hell.
No! Never!
The way is not easy,
I know... but I will take you by the hand... and lead you through the cruel light... into the velvet darkness.
Lord Satan... he who is known as
Belial by the ancients... demon lover, of all those... who wish to live in your eternal night... here in your hour of deepest dark... in your temple and before your altar...
I twice bind myself to thee:
As your handmaiden and your betrothed.
And with this symbol of your lasting victory...
I inscribe the final mark and offer myself to thee.
Oh, Lord Satan, send me a demon... so I may know
I'm to be your wife.
What are you lurking about for... you grinning, twisted devil?
Not only am I afflicted with this body... but with sleeplessness as well.
Losing your sleep because of the tiny dancer?
She's nothing to me.
I prefer a full-sized woman.
Do you, now?
How do you set about getting such a woman?
My Master Prospero provides me... with companions from time to time.
A good master.
Yes, I suppose so... but I imagine there are better.
You'd like to leave
Prospero's service?
I fear for the security of his reign.
If I could find a strong protector...
I might dare a change.
And what special service have you to offer... that might persuade someone else... to take you under his protection?
All manner of things.
I've a crafty and inventive mind.
Indeed?
For example?
The masquerade.
I would devise something startling, novel... something that would be the talk... of the entire revel.
Have you told Prospero of this novel thing?
I fear the Prince is much too austere.
Will you tell me?
Everyone will dress as usual.
A harlequin, a Chinese, a soldier, or a princess.
They will all either be beautiful or humorous.
But all will be obviously human.
I will come as a demon.
Why not come as a great ape?
When the guests are gathered... you would enter... arms swinging... advancing toward the screaming lady... with lowered head and grinning jaw.
It'll be more than a costume.
It will be a performance... by the cleverest man at the court.
Where would I get such a disguise?
There is one... in the room of stuffed animals.
Another toy Prince Prospero never bothers with anymore.
I'm sure it's forgotten.
You really think it would cause a sensation?
Oh, yes.
And there is more to the game.
Oh, Juliana.
Thank god.
I thought...
Yes?
I don't know.
What's that?
Satan's mark.
Prospero did that to you?
No.
I did it to myself.
It marks me as one of Satan's handmaidens.
Are you ill?
No.
It was a difficult ceremony.
Veils of ignorance were lifted from my eyes.
And now there's only
1 more rite to perform... and I will be wed to Satan.
You've given away your soul.
Yes. Gladly.
Soon all the innocence will be gone... and then I will have immortality... and I shall have Prospero.
But I must be certain.
And if you were gone...
Gladly!
If there were a way.
Would you dare to leave the safety of this castle?
There is no safety for me here.
This key will unlock the cell.
The guard on the north wall has been bribed.
Take your Gino and your father and go.
But the guards...
The way through to the dungeons?
You've been to the armory and to the dungeons.
You must make your own way.
Now go. Quickly.
Gino?
Gino?
Gino.
Francesca.
How did you...
Juliana.
Quick, we must hurry to the battlements.
The guard there will help us.
I think I heard something.
Oh, sit down and play.
Guard.
Juliana betrayed us.
She betrayed me.
What can you want of two men... who've done you no harm?
They killed 3 of my guards.
Three human beings.
According to your faith, they have sinned greatly.
And tomorrow at the feast before the masque... at least 1 of them must pay for those sins.
Hear me.
Hear me!
Soon you will be costuming yourselves... for the masque.
A celebration, my friends.
A celebration of victory over death... of evil over good.
Senor Scarlatti and his wife will not be joining us.
He failed to obey my orders.
But because of me... through my mediation with my master... the lord of flies... you, all of you... unworthy though you may be... will be safe from the Red Death.
We promise you.
Unless, of course, you incur our displeasure.
For some of you are guilty of acts against us.
Acts of faith, perhaps.
And all of you,
I suspect... still harbor some... sacred thoughts.
But no more.
The fallen angel will protect you.
And now for a small entertainment.
Guards!
These 2 men are true believers.
They believe in a god... who preached
"love thy neighbor."
Therefore they refuse to fight each other... in order to save one of their lives.
However, I have devised a plan... whereby each may have the honor and glory... of saving the other's life.
There are 5 daggers here.
One of them is impregnated with a poison... that kills in 5 seconds.
Each man, in turn, will cut his forearm.
Begin.
Would you not lay down your life... for your brother?
Next.
Five seconds.
Five seconds.
Five seconds.
Father!
The game was not played properly... so both will die.
- No.
- You're a madman.
And yet I will live and you will die.
Where is your god now in the hour of your need?
I will see Him... in Paradise.
In the role of a martyr.
No. I will not have you killed.
I will set you free instead.
Free to go back to your village... and the Red Death.
I beg you.
I am only giving him a further glorious chance... to test his faith, my dear.
Out.
I'll come back for you,
Francesca.
Somehow, I'll come back.
Prince Prospero, let me go with him.
- You?
- Please.
You?
Oh, no, my dear.
I could not bear to think of...
No.
You will go to your rooms now... and prepare for the masque.
You will not appear in your costumes until midnight.
Why do you follow me?
Bring Gino back, and...
I will do whatever you wish.
You would destroy yourself for him?
Yes.
You almost cause me to doubt.
Prospero.
My prince.
I'm ready.
My son.
Tell me of it.
My god.
My god.
Who is your god?
The true one.
Yes.
Tell me.
I have sinned.
I have killed.
- For yourself?
- No.
Now I'm afraid.
- For yourself?
- For Francesca.
And for me.
I must go back for her, but I don't know how.
What weapon can I use against Prospero?
Love.
In the air, through the trees...
I found myself loving only myself.
I'm afraid of the town where the Red Death walks.
I'm afraid of Prospero in his castle.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid.
I give you a sign.
What does it mean?
Mankind.
Won't this thing become uncomfortably hot?
It will become a little warm.
But it won't be for long.
After the unmasking... you can take it off... because the game will be over.
True enough.
Get on with it.
Perfect.
Perfect.
See yourself.
Now crouch low.
And swing your arms.
Back, mighty animal.
I am your keeper... brought from deepest Africa... to control your great strength.
Back!
Back!
Where do you go?
The burial ground's beyond the hill.
We go to the castle.
Why?
To beg forgiveness of the prince.
Forgiveness?
For what?
For however we have sinned.
You'll beg forgiveness at the house of Satan himself?
Better than the Red Death.
Stop. Stop!
My master...
Satan.
Prospero?
Prospero?
I am betrothed... of the devil.
And I have seen the terrors.
Not all of them.
I have survived my own sacrifice.
There is more.
And I am stronger in the devil's favor... than you are.
Together, on Earth, we shall live as man and wife.
And when he calls us... you will be Satan... and I still your wife.
I have tasted the beauties of terror.
Hush.
Listen.
The passing of time... the beating of a heart... the footstep of an assassin.
Destiny.
I beg you, do not mourn for Juliana.
We should celebrate.
She has just married a friend of mine.
Let the masque begin!
Officer of the night watch.
Who are you?
All that is left of the village of Catania.
Then go back to it.
We beg mercy of the lord
Prince Prospero.
Inform the prince.
It might amuse him.
Don't grovel to him.
Don't let him delight in the destruction... of your souls.
I wish to save our bodies.
The few left to us.
Do you expect any plea to move his heart?
If we must die, let's die like human beings.
You have not seen the Red Death.
You've not seen the dungeons of Prospero.
Don't be frightened.
Come with me.
This is Gino.
This is my child.
I must give her every chance.
Where does the rabbit run?
That one fears Prospero more than the Red Death.
What do you want?
Mercy, great prince.
This is all that is left of us... and the winter... it comes on the freezing wind.
- There is no shelter.
- Dig a burrow... as the fox and rabbits do.
But the wells and the streams... they'll be frozen over.
There's no food.
Then store up nuts, like the squirrels.
Mercy.
Give us the sanctuary of the castle walls.
Give me an end to your pleading.
Go back from whence you came.
We will die.
If you refuse to go, then... die here.
Archers.
But not the child.
It will perish anyway.
Not the child.
Fire.
Fire.
Gifts!
Gifts for everyone!
Diamonds, rubies, emeralds, pearls for my friends!
For my guests!
Look at them.
Look at them all scrambling... like starving men for a crust of bread.
All wealthy, and all greedy for more.
I give you reason... for real rejoicing, my friends.
The only survivors of the village... have just come to the castle walls.
Only 6.
The Red Death has claimed the rest of them.
But as I promised you... all of you within these walls under my protection are safe.
So rejoice!
And the 6 who lived?
Dead.
But they demanded to enter the castle.
You killed them.
It was a kindness, my dear.
Can't you see that?
The Red Death brings pain and terror and madness.
I spared them.
Tonight, after the masque...
I will initiate you into understanding.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Gently, my son.
Remain here.
Shortly after the stroke of 1:00...
I will send
Francesca to you.
I must get to her now.
You have recovered your courage.
Now prove your wisdom.
There is nothing you can do.
There are too many.
Wait, as I tell you.
The guards will discover me.
Look there.
Yes?
Oh.
Forgive me for startling you.
It's only Hop Toad... made more ugly than even he is.
You're not ugly to me.
I've come to tell you... that there's no need for you to appear... at the masque tonight.
I don't understand.
My plans are made.
If you will trust me and believe in me... we'll leave this monstrous castle tonight.
Do we dare?
The Red Death...
It can be no worse than life here.
Believe in me.
I do believe in you.
Have a warm cloak and be ready.
The game is almost over.
Have no fear!
I can control this monster.
He only wants a game.
He is too playful.
I will tie him up and make him helpless.
Help!
Help!
Let me down, you fiendish dwarf!
Let me down!
Better let me down.
Look, my dear,
I believe Hop Toad is playing... some sort of a joke on Alfredo.
I will set you to tortures unimagined!
You have already tortured... by your cruelty to my Esmeralda.
Hold this!
The great African ape says he wants some brandy.
Let me down.
Let me down!
Help! Help!
Help! Let me down!
Help! Help! Let me down!
I see you no longer turn away... from the cruelties of life.
I no longer care.
My life is done.
What's left
I give to you tonight.
Guards, clear that out of the way.
How can my guests... be expected to dance around that?
And when you find Hop Toad... give him 5 pieces of gold as a reward... for his entertaining jest.
You've pleased me very much, my dear.
What was that?
What is it?
A costume
I haven't seen before.
Someone wearing red.
And I forbade them to wear red.
Come.
There he is again.
Come.
Wait! Wait!
Wait!
I command you to wait!
Prospero.
Prospero.
You command me to wait?
Very well.
I wait.
Condotti?
Rimini?
Who are you beneath your mask?
Is my costume such a disguise... that you don't recognize me?
Your voice is familiar.
Dr. Bernelli, that's who you are.
Bernelli, you dog, thinking to...
You are not Bernelli.
No.
The doctor dances in the white room.
But I passed close by him.
Truly, Prospero, you don't know me?
So you've come.
Yes, Prospero.
On your knees.
- Prospero!
- On your knees.
The Prince of Darkness.
I would like to see your face.
There is no face of death... until the moment of your own death.
And I am only 1 of many messengers.
Who do you come for?
Many.
All?
Not all.
I knew I was right.
I knew it.
I've won.
The time of unmasking.
They begin to show their naked faces.
It's time for a new dance to begin...
The dance of death.
Our master will be pleased.
I brought all of these souls to him.
I taught them his worship.
I corrupted them for him.
I knew he was supreme when no one else did.
I built a chapel to Satan, and I prayed to him, and I made a pact with him.
And these, all of my friends,
I promised them safety.
You presumed too much.
I know. I know.
But it does make a fine jest... the kind of jest that would amuse Satan.
Would it?
Your Excellency... this girl... in all my life...
I've never met anyone whose faith rivaled mine.
Spare her to me.
A charitable request?
A rare thing with you,
Prospero.
Go to the battlements.
Go now.
Yes, Francesca.
Yes, go, and I will join you... when this is over.
Thank you, your Excellency... for the girl.
I have no title.
Why do you call me Excellency?
Well, I thought as the ambassador of Satan...
He is not my master.
Death has no master.
But Satan rules the universe.
I made a pact with him.
He does not rule alone.
And your pact with him will not save you.
There is no other god.
Satan killed him.
Each man creates his own god for himself... his own heaven, his own hell.
Let me see your face.
Your hell,
Prince Prospero... and the moment of your death.
No.
No!
No!
Why should you be afraid to die?
Your soul has been dead for a long time.
Morning, brother.
You've come far?
From Cathay and beyond.
100,000 perished at my passing... this last night.
This eternity of wandering...
10,000 sleep where I walked.
I am very tired.
The weariness of those... to whom we bring rest burdens you.
What of you, brother?
I called many... peasant and prince... the worthy and the dishonored.
Six only are left... young man and woman... dwarf and tiny dancer... this child... and an old man still in the village.
Sic transit gloria mundi.
Annette!
Bonjour, Janiello.
Janiello!
Hey, ferry!
I want to come across.
We were like this, he and I.
As close as I'm standing to you now.
He had this pick axe, understand?
He was going to brain me with it.
What did you do then, Monsieur Salon?
I went for help.
What else could a man do in a situation such as that?
What else indeed?
Oh, the ferry?
I'm sorry. There is some trouble with the motor.
How long will it take?
I don't know.
It's difficult to say.
Give me a cognac, will you?
It is not good to drink cognac, monsieur, in the heat of the day.
Headache.
Monsieur already has a headache.
Your health.
And yours, monsieur.
Another.
Monsieur is a tourist?
Monsieur is not a tourist.
But you are English.
No, American.
You have no car.
I have no nothing.
How did you get to St. Gironde?
I walked
How long is monsieur staying in St...
So, this is where you're hiding.
Lucky I found you.
Lucky for who?
If you've finished sulking, perhaps we can get on.
- Have a drink, Grace
- I don't want a drink.
- Are you coming?
- No.
I'll leave without you.
That's the basic idea, Grace, or hadn't that got through to you?
You can't stay here, miles from any damn place.
How are you going to get anywhere without me?
I'm a big boy now, Grace.
Then start behaving like one.
Oh, I'm trying to.
That's why I'm not coming any further.
Not with you, anyway.
Besides, I like it here. I've always wanted to visit, um...
- St. Gironde.
- Yeah, St. Gironde. Jewel of the Provence.
All right, if you want to be pig-headed, you can.
But I warn you, this time I'm really leaving.
I don't believe you.
I shan't be waiting in Nice when you come looking for me.
Give my regards to your father.
Ah, but
I'm a very big boy now.
That's life.
Do you have rooms here, mademoiselle?
Yes, but you'll have to ask my stepmother.
Where is she?
She's out at present.
But she'll be back shortly.
I'll wait.
I'm going, Annette.
The young lady will be quite safe, Officer.
I'm a confirmed misogynist, as you must have gathered.
Well, in that case... Good day, monsieur. Annette.
Good-bye, Mr. Salon.
Are you going to paint?
I'm going to try.
There is nothing much to paint around here.
Oh, on the contrary.
From what I've seen of it, it's very beautiful, but in a stark sort of way.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Monsieur was enquiring about a room.
I told him he would have to see you.
Oh. I'm Madame Beynat.
I understand you were asking about the room.
Yes. Do you have one free?
Will your wife be coming back?
She's not my wife.
She won't be coming back.
No, I'm quite alone.
Oh.
Well, yes, we have a room.
But it's not here, it's on the other side.
All right.
Annette, monsieur will be staying.
Will you excuse me?
The jukebox really out of order?
Yes.
Like the ferry.
Monsieur would like another drink?
No, thank you.
Um...
I'm going to be needing somebody to show me around.
You know, the local beauty spots and things like that.
Are you really a good painter?
No. Will you?
I knew a painter once.
He wasn't very good either.
You're avoiding the question, mademoiselle.
What was the question?
Well, I was asking your stepdaughter if she'd be able to show me around St. Gironde.
Annette, uh, Giles has the ferry ready.
Would you go across and fix monsieur's room?
All right, Eve.
Did I say the wrong thing?
Oh, no.
No, it's just that the...
Annette never does anything without asking me first.
But of course she can show you around.
We'll both do it.
Would you like a drink?
Yeah, I'll have a beer.
Mmm.
Will you join me?
No, thank you.
Not now.
If you, uh, give me a screwdriver, I'll fix this thing.
I'm an electronic wizard.
She was very angry, that one.
My compatriot told me she drove through the village at a formidable speed.
That's my girl.
Ah, she's very beautiful for an English woman.
I agree.
Monsieur did not mind her taking the automobile?
It was hers,
Monsieur Salon.
Ah! She's rich, too.
Yes, she is very rich.
Beautiful and rich.
As you said, monsieur, that's life.
Let's dance.
It's a long time since we've seen
Annette so happy, eh, Madame Beynat?
Annette!
Will you come and help me, darling?
Can I buy you a drink,
Monsieur Salon?
Oh, no, thank you, monsieur, I'm on duty.
And when on duty I allow myself three drinks only.
It is better.
Ah, well,
I must go now.
I think I'll get some air, too.
Good night, Monsieur Farrell.
Good night.
No, don't. I brought you a nightcap.
Oh, well, thank you.
He wanted to lock you up this morning.
He thought you were a little mad.
And now?
Well, you're an American, so everything is explained.
Is your room comfortable?
Oh, yes, thank you.
And, uh, was your dinner all right?
My dinner was excellent.
Do you worry about all your guests this way?
You're the first one we've had since...
For four years.
Maybe that'll change now that I've fixed the jukebox.
Uh, could I borrow Giles for a couple of minutes?
Yes, of course.
Oh, Annette!
Yes?
Will you please tell Giles that monsieur would like to cross?
All right.
Good night, Annette.
Good night, monsieur.
Thank you very much for the dance.
Uh, Monsieur Farrell...
Yes?
You wouldn't think that Annette was already 19, would you?
I hadn't given it any thought.
She's such a child, really.
Impressionable, you understand?
Yes, Mrs. Beynat, I think I do.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I hope you manage to sleep in this heat.
Hello.
I, um...
I couldn't sleep.
Why are you awake?
Well, it's hot.
It's always hot here at night.
Would you like a drink?
Yes, all right.
Cognac?
Yes, thank you.
Are you going to stay here long, Mr. Farrell?
I don't know. Why?
I was just wondering.
Tell me.
What do you do around here?
Don't you find it dull?
Oh, no.
My work keeps me busy.
And then there's riding, swimming.
Alone?
It does get lonely sometimes.
There must be something seriously wrong with the young men of St. Gironde.
What?
Excuse me, please.
I'll only be a moment.
That's 40 francs you owe me, Geoff.
I know.
- One more game?
- Okay.
What about tomorrow?
I don't know, Geoff.
Look, I'm not asking you to elope with me.
I just want you to come on a picnic.
All right.
Annette.
What are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep.
Suppose you go back to bed and try again.
All right, Eve.
Thank you for keeping me company, Geoff.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Good night.
I'm sorry about this,
Mr. Farrell.
Don't be.
I couldn't sleep either.
I saw a prowler.
I think Annette did, too.
She was nervous and she wanted somebody to sit up with her till you came home.
- A prowler?
- Just after you went out.
Oh.
Well, there are a lot of
Gypsies here on the Camargue.
They're harmless.
Mr. Farrell...
You shouldn't let Annette take advantage of your good nature.
Shall we?
Okay.
Hello there.
Hello.
I brought your lunch.
Where's Annette?
She was busy. She asked me to apologize.
You shouldn't have bothered.
It was no bother.
Feels like there's enough in here for 10 people.
Will you join me?
I should be getting back.
All right then.
But not here.
I know a much better place.
Up there.
More wine?
No, thank you.
This is a beautiful place.
Mmm-hmm.
We used to come here a lot.
I'm not surprised.
Annette loved it.
Her father would...
Go on.
No. It's not important.
No, Annette's father...
Well, stop me if I'm being nosey, Mrs. Beynat, but there is a Mr. Beynat?
Oh, yes.
There is a Mr. Beynat.
And, uh, he won't mind you renting me this room?
We're a registered pension, Mr. Farrell.
Why should he mind?
Well, just you and Annette there.
He won't know.
Oh, he's not coming back soon?
You must have read about it even in the American papers.
They called it,
"The Acetylene Killing. "
Acetylene...
It's Beynat, Georges Beynat.
He's my husband.
Annette's father.
Wasn't it something to do with her?
Mmm-hmm.
That man he killed,
Janiello.
He picked up Annette on her way home from school.
She was 15.
He assaulted her.
Georges got hold of him before the police did.
You see, people here believe that a man should be able to settle his own differences without interference from the law.
Georges was a hero in their eyes.
It was the Janiello family that had to leave.
Pretty bloody crime.
Mmm-hmm.
It was so terrible that they found Georges insane.
Was he insane?
Well, at the moment he must have been.
But it was an insanity of rage.
Now I think he's as sane as you are now.
Where is he now?
He's in an asylum just outside Avignon.
I go and see him every fortnight.
That can't be a very pleasant experience.
It's horrible.
He just sits and looks at me.
He never asks about anything.
Except about Annette.
He just sits there and looks.
He hates me, I think, for being outside while he's locked up.
Well, it's no good talking about it.
The situation exists and there's nothing that can be done.
I must be going home now.
I really enjoyed our picnic.
I can't tell you how much.
Then we'll do it again.
I'd like it.
Very much.
Do you ride,
Mr. Farrell?
If I have to.
Because I'd like to show you the
Camargue as it should be seen.
From horseback.
How are you getting on with your painting?
Oh, I'm still waiting for inspiration.
Well, like most things if you wait long enough, it will happen eventually.
See you tonight.
More coffee?
Yes, thank you.
That was one of the best meals I've ever eaten.
You're an incredible cook, Annette.
Thank you.
Eve taught me.
Where is Eve?
I don't know.
She often goes away like this without telling anyone.
May I ask you something, Geoff?
What?
When you first decided to stay here...
I mean, without having made any plans, was there anyone who might wonder where you are?
Worry about you?
The only person who worries about me is me.
But you must have some relation, a family.
No. No family, no relations.
Well, what about that girl?
G race?
Are you lovers?
You mean are we in love, or are we lovers?
I'm sorry. I'll tell you about Grace.
She has a very rich father.
Anything he wants he buys.
And she was brought up that way.
She sees a thing she wants, she asks the price and most times she gets it.
But not this time.
Me? Oh, it's not as dramatic as that.
She wanted to go to Nice, I didn't.
That seems a small thing to disagree on.
Well, I used it as an excuse, really.
In London, Grace blinded me with her reflected glory.
Oh, I thought
I was in love with her.
Probably because everybody else was after her.
But a week of Grace exclusively is too much, I'm afraid.
And I wouldn't have minded going to Nice, as it happens.
But not with Grace.
Definitely not with Grace.
What are you going to do now?
Stay here for a while.
Oh, I really am a painter.
At least, that's how
I make my living.
I'd like to paint you.
Why?
Because you're a very beautiful young lady.
Where are you going?
I must clear away.
I'll help.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Oh.
Annette has cooked you dinner.
Yes.
She's a wonderful cook.
Aren't you, dear?
She said you taught her.
Oh. She flatters me.
I promised to show you the
Camargue from horseback.
What about tomorrow?
Yes, I'd like that.
Good.
Good night,
Mr. Farrell.
Good night.
Thank you, Annette, for the dinner.
You're a wonderful rider.
I've had a lot of practice.
There isn't much else to do over here.
I'll race you to the sea.
Come on!
Come on, it's wonderful.
Oh, you're a coward.
What didn't you join me?
I would have, but my horse had other ideas.
You've come prepared.
But of course.
Is this where you come on those occasions when you disappear?
Yes.
It's wonderful, isn't it?
Miles and miles without another soul.
Meaning you, um, like to be alone?
Sometimes.
Don't you?
Not very often.
Bearing that in mind, am I invited again?
Of course.
If you make yourself useful.
Here.
Do you want a drink?
No, I don't think so.
I'm going to bed.
Then I'll come up with you.
Darling, I love you.
You know that, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it makes me so happy.
I feel I've come alive again thanks to you.
If only...
If only what?
No, nothing.
Nothing really.
Hey, come on, tell me.
It's tomorrow.
How I dread tomorrow.
What about tomorrow?
I have to visit Georges.
Oh, I see.
Oh, darling.
You don't know how awful it's been.
Oh, I can guess.
And now it's going to be so much worse.
Because of me?
Yes, but it's not your problem.
Well, I want your problems to be mine now.
Oh, it may sound selfish, but I love you to say that.
Just someone to worry about me again.
To think about me.
I'd like to come with you tomorrow.
I would like that very much.
How was it, darling?
The same.
Do you want to talk about it?
No. Not now.
You want to go home?
No.
But let's get away from here.
Okay, come on then.
You drive.
Geoff, please, let's not talk about it anymore.
Don't be silly, Eve.
It's the only way. We've got to do it just that way.
If I had thought you were going to take it seriously,
I would never have told you what he said.
But you did tell me and I am taking it seriously.
But we're breaking the law, apart from everything else.
Well, the law's been broken before.
The only considerations are moral ones.
But they count.
Of course they do.
Isn't this whole thing one of morals?
You won't come away with me as long as your husband's locked up.
L, on the other hand, am not going to give you up.
And he won't give you up unless we help him escape from prison.
It is not a prison.
It's an asylum.
And he isn't insane.
You told me yourself the doctors were considering transferring him to a regular prison.
They wouldn't do that if he wasn't all right.
If we were contemplating turning loose a homicidal maniac,
I'd agree with you, but we're not.
We're helping a man to start a new life.
You make it sound the only thing to do.
Well, that's because it is.
Now, where is he going to go?
I don't know and I don't care.
Well, what about Annette?
He wants her to join him as soon as he's settled.
And all we have to do is pick him up as he comes over the wall.
Mmm-hmm.
He's got everything arranged inside.
One of the male nurses is going to help him escape.
We just have to take him to the boat.
Then I really don't see what we're arguing about.
Unless you don't want to be free.
You know it's not true, darling, don't you?
Yes, of course I do.
All that's left is to see if Annette will agree.
Of course I agree.
I'll go with him wherever it is.
I wasn't going to stay here anyway.
Do you think I have enjoyed watching you two?
You're married to my father.
What you have been doing is a crime against him and against God.
Whichever way all this comes out, you'll have to pay for it.
Eve is young,
Annette.
It isn't right for her to spend the rest of her life alone.
Why not?
Wasn't father supposed to?
When is it going to happen?
Your father will tell me next time I go to see him.
As soon as he's safely away, he'll send you a cable to tell you where to meet him.
What's going to happen to this place?
I think I'll sell it.
It's not yours to sell.
But it will be.
Your father's going to make it over to me.
When I sell,
I'll keep half the money, and the other half I'll send to you and to him wherever you are.
We don't need the money, Eve.
You can send it all to them.
You take a man's wife,
Mr. Farrell, but not his money?
I haven't taken anything, Annette.
Your father and Eve have nothing for one another anymore.
These things happen.
It takes a man like you to start them.
Don't worry.
She'll be all right, I think.
No, darling, not tonight.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I'm just tired.
I think I'll go to bed.
He's well over an hour late.
What could have happened?
In there, anything.
We can't stay here any longer, come on.
Just a few more minutes.
Eve, I don't know very much about these things, but one thing I do know, they work to a timetable.
And when something goes wrong, that's the end of it.
He'll tell you all about it when you see him again.
Come on.
What could have happened?
Nothing happened.
Georges, what happened?
Where the devil have you been?
We thought something had gone wrong.
Let's go.
Where to?
Marseilles, Pier 5.
How long before they miss you?
The morning.
You'll be at sea by then.
Yes.
Do you know yet where you are going?
Yes.
Where?
You will hear from me as arranged.
Is this all right?
Mmm-hmm.
Good-bye, Georges.
Good-bye, Eve.
Good luck.
Have we done the right thing, Geoff?
It's too late to worry about that now.
Then there is absolutely nothing more you can tell me, Madame Beynat?
Nothing, Inspector.
When you last visited your husband, he gave you no sign that he planned anything like this?
No.
Good morning.
Ah. You're
Mr. Farrell?
Yes, I am.
Inspector Etienne from Marseilles.
How do you do?
I would like to ask you, Mr. Farrell, if you saw or heard anything unusual last night.
Unusual in what way?
Unusual, anything that was not customary.
No, I don't think so, why?
A dangerous man escaped from a mental asylum last night.
We have reason to believe he may come here.
Here?
What on earth for?
Why do Americans always answer questions with questions of their own?
Simply, Monsieur Farrell, did you or did you not notice anything unusual last night?
- No, I did not.
- Ah.
Madame Beynat, you will tell me if you see or hear from your husband?
Oh, yes, of course, Inspector.
And you, mademoiselle?
Yes.
Oh, there's one more thing which may be of importance.
I have been asking about one man, Georges Beynat.
In fact, there are two men in whom we are interested.
One of the male nurses at the asylum disappeared last night also.
It may be that he assisted in the escape.
It may be that he is merely absent without leave.
In any case, you will keep me informed?
Oh, yes, Inspector.
Thank you. Madame.
Monsieur.
He didn't say anything about anyone else last night.
Well, maybe the man just ran away.
Yeah. Maybe.
Where are you going?
I'm going into Aries to do some shopping.
Well, I'll drive.
All right.
Oh, look at these over here.
Aren't they sweet?
I want to get some things over here.
A kilo of those, please.
Tell me, what would you have done if I hadn't come along?
Strange as it may seem to you, I always can find someone to carry my parcels.
- Here.
- I'm just a work horse.
Take these to the car.
I'm going to buy a present.
What?
You'll see.
Quick. Get in the car.
What is it?
- Get in. Please, get in.
- Geoff, what is it?
But the shopping... Forget it.
I'll explain later.
That's why he didn't moot u: at the place he was supposed to.
He had to get that in the car without us seeing.
What are we going to do?
Oh, I don't know yet.
The police?
We can't.
We're accessories.
We helped him escape, and this is a direct result of what we did.
What then?
Got to get rid of it.
- Where?
- Here.
Geoff. Look.
Get in the car quick, you drive.
What about... I'll get rid of him tonight.
I found the key.
It's very rusty.
I'll get the car.
I'll go and see what he wants.
Geoff.
Oh, Geoff.
What is it?
No, he's the only one who could have sent them.
The driver said they were ordered by phone this morning.
That means he couldn't have got on the boat.
Maybe there's something he wants more.
What? Annette?
- That was arranged.
- No. You.
He agreed to let me go.
Yeah, so we'd help him escape.
But if he stays around, he's bound to be caught eventually.
Yes, but he might not care.
That's silly.
Why should he want to escape if he doesn't care?
- Revenge.
- On who?
You and me.
How do we know what went through his mind when you told him about us?
Locked up in that place with nothing else to think about.
He might have planned this whole thing just to get even.
Oh, Geoff.
- That's crazy.
- Yes, exactly.
Make up your mind, Eve. We're dealing with a homicidal maniac.
Do you want me to help?
No.
This makes us as guilty as he is.
Yes, I know.
What's happening? What are you doing here, Annette?
I heard a noise.
Then I saw this light.
I came to see what it was.
You shouldn't touch that.
It's dangerous.
I didn't.
I told you, it was burning when I got here.
Are you sure, dear?
Of course I'm sure.
What will I do with that?
Come on, darling. We better go back to the house.
So, what do we know?
We know Georges
Beynat escaped.
And we know that he enlisted the Id of one of the stff.
Without that aid, he could not have reached the wall.
Now, when these two men climbed the wall, it was necessary that there should be a car waiting for them.
They get in and drive, or are driven.
Where?
The docks.
And why do you say the docks, monsieur?
It's natural if they wanted to get away.
You're thinking like a sane man, but remember,
Beynat is insane.
He still wanted to get away, or he wouldn't have escaped.
Ah. But why did he want to get away?
A model inmate by all accounts.
Insane, yes.
But obeying the rules, behaving himself.
Apparently quite contented within his mental limitations.
What happened after four years that should suddenly make him want to escape?
You visited him frequently, madame?
Inspector, I told you all I know.
Hmm.
Something happened.
Something that made it necessary for him to be on the outside.
We must search for this something.
Then we shall know where to find him.
I don't know why you're telling me all this, Inspector.
This would be the last place where he'd come back to.
I have learned long ago to look in the last place first.
It saves time.
But there's nothing here for him.
Nothing?
His wife, his daughter, his home.
You call this nothing?
He's given them up four years ago.
No, madame. He did not give them up.
They were taken away from him.
Remember that, please. They were taken away from him.
And now, perhaps, he would like something back. Eve, it's...
Inspector.
And you were going to say?
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
Please, go on.
But remember, madame, Georges
Beynat is completely mad.
I have spoken to his doctors and they have told me.
He is without doubt the most dangerous man I have ever searched for.
Please remember this.
And should he try to contact you,
or you, mademoiselle,
I implore you, let me know.
We will let you know, Inspector.
Thank you.
You are staying long in St. Gironde, monsieur?
Why?
Just that it is necessary, after a while, to register with the local police.
I'll remember that, Inspector, if I stay that long.
Good day.
It came. The telegram from Father.
Show me.
From Arles?
Let me see.
The arena at
Aries at 11:00.
Well, you're not going.
Of course I'm going.
Isn't it what we have all been waiting for?
Well, you can't go, Annette.
Who are you to tell me what I can or cannot do?
Eve, tell him.
Tell him he can't order me about.
Annette,
I think you should do what he says.
You might have to, but I don't.
What happened?
Why have you changed your minds?
Darling.
There are some things about your father we didn't tell you.
No, I don't want to hear them.
I'm going, and there is nothing either of you can do to stop me.
I'm going to pack.
Annette.
I don't see how we can stop her.
Oh, I'll take her in to Aries tonight.
At least I can see him, ask him some questions.
I'll decide about her later.
No, Geoff.
I think it's better if I take her.
Darling, I'll be all right.
But he'll be less suspicious, he'll talk easier, and I'll know if there's anything wrong.
You stay here, in case it's some kind of a trick, or if the police call again.
Believe me, it's the best way.
All right.
I'll go and tell Annette.
- Darling.
- Mmm?
You know that I love you and I need you.
Be careful tonight.
I aimed at him.
Twice I fired.
Twice I missed.
And twice the inspector from
Marseilles has been here, and twice
I have missed him.
He'll be back.
Do not misunderstand me, Monsieur Farrell.
I have no desire to see him.
He'll tell me my buttons are dirty, my uniform is not neat enough, and my record of arrests is non-existent.
I don't think he's that kind of Inspector.
All inspectors are the same, monsieur.
This is the tenth time you've looked at that clock.
You are worried about the time?
No.
The ladies, perhaps you are worried about them?
Ladies?
Madame and
Mademoiselle Annette.
Oh, I'm not worried.
Why should I be?
Why indeed?
There's no one here.
It's open.
Can you see anyone?
No.
What time is it?
It's well over 11:00.
But he said 11:00.
Eve, I'm frightened.
I do not know who is the bigger fool, Farrell.
Eve, or you.
Her for thinking that I would stand by while she went off with another man, or you for helping her.
I am a wanted man.
Everywhere I go, I shall be looking back over my shoulder for the rest of my life.
This I do not like.
So I have arranged that I shall die.
Here.
Now.
This way I will not be looking back over my shoulder any more.
But I am supposed to be mad, so I must behave like a madman.
Hmm?
This person here, he helped me to escape from the asylum.
We came here to hide.
We quarreled, we fought.
He was killed, but I am mad!
So I do not just bury him,
or throw him in the canal, as you did, monsieur. No, no.
My diseased mind won't allow me to do that. No, no.
I'll recreate the same crime that I committed four years ago. Eh? Hmm?
This way, the police will nod their stupid heads and say it is a typical pathological pattern.
These things can be very dangerous.
If they are not handled carefully, then these cylinders, they can explode with devastating effect, which is what they are going to do.
But later on, after I have used them.
They will destroy this place completely.
Nothing will be left except the wreckage and the remains of two bodies.
The police will arrive, and they will try to put these two bodies together.
They will throw their hands in the air and they will say,
"He has done it again.
"The mad Beynat has done it again.
"But this time he was too smart.
"The equipment blew up in his face.
"He's dead.
"No longer do we need to look for him. "
Eh? You see?
Two men missing from the asylum, and two bodies found here.
What makes you think
I won't be missed?
Oh, Eve will get a letter.
You found the whole thing too much and went back to America.
I think I would have killed you anyway, Farrell.
I don't like people who take from me what is mine.
Now at least your death will serve a purpose.
And now to set the scene.
First,
I think we will burn him a little, and then we will arrange the explosion.
I am afraid I will have to keep you tied to the cylinders for a while, but it won't be for long, I promise you.
You needn't watch if it upsets you.
What happened,
Inspector?
We found two bodies in the debris.
Your husband, I'm afraid, was one of them.
The other, the male nurse who helped him escape.
It seems as though your husband was attempting to recreate the crime he committed four years ago.
A typical pathological pattern.
Then suddenly, the equipment must have blown up in his face.
He's dead?
One of them is still alive.
Burned very badly, but still alive.
I'm sorry, madame.
It is impossible to tell which one it is.
Where did they take him?
The small hospital at St. Lucien.
But it would be pointless.
But please, Inspector.
It might be my husband, you just said so.
If you wish. I shall leave instructions.
Now it would be better if you both go inside.
Inspector, they are calling you on the radio.
He was my father.
But if he did kill that man that helped him, then it's for the best.
It is, Eve.
Eve?
Eve, what is it?
It was Geoff.
What are you talking about?
One of the two men in there was Geoff.
Why do you say that?
Because I know it.
The police think that those two men escaped from the asylum.
Those must be the two.
But I know that the male nurse who helped your father escape is buried out on the Camargue.
We did it ourselves,
Geoff and I.
Miles away.
So, if there were two men in that workshop, then one of them must be Geoff.
Then how did the male nurse die?
Your father killed him.
And Geoff too, but why? Why?
Because he's insane!
I must go to the hospital.
I must find out.
But you don't know which one it is who's still alive.
It might be father.
Thank you.
Geoff.
I know it's you.
It can only be you.
Just as my husband and I had planned it.
The other one was already dead, wasn't he?
Georges brought him back from where you buried him on the Camargue.
It was the only way he and I could be together.
Now he's officially dead.
No one is going to look for him any more.
He can go wherever he wants.
You know what I have to do now, Geoff.
I'm sorry I have to do it myself.
I didn't want to.
I may keep it, madame?
If you wish.
I don't suppose Mr. Farrell will be returning.
It is strange, him leaving like that, without a word.
I saw him that night.
Oh, you did? When?
While you and Miss
Annette were in Aries.
He seemed worried, I remember. He kept looking at the cafe clock.
Mmm. Well, I suppose he was worried about his train.
Strange.
Without a word to anyone.
I hadn't thought of it with all that happened.
Oh, of course not.
Such tragedy.
But for the best, madame, I feel.
I suppose you're right, Mr. Salon.
Yes. Well, I must go now.
Good-bye, madame.
Good-bye.
This can't go on, Eve.
What can't?
This deception.
We must ring the police.
And tell them what?
Everything about Geoff and that poor man being buried out there on the Camargue.
There's too much being left unsaid about the whole thing.
Listen, Annette.
Do you think I'll ever be able to forget about Geoff?
I really loved him, you know.
But it's all finished now.
What good would it do to tell them about the body out on the Camargue?
They've accepted the fact of his death.
Why resurrect it all?
No, Eve.
I'm going to tell the police.
Very well.
I think you're right.
But not on the phone.
You go over to the cafe and lock it.
I'll ring Inspector Etienne and tell him you're coming over to see him.
Thank you, Eve. I'm sure it's for the best.
I'll tell Giles we won't be back till this evening.
It's a long drive to Marseilles, darling.
How'd you like to spend the night there?
We can do some shopping tomorrow morning.
I'd like that very much.
All right, then tell Giles we won't be back until tomorrow evening,
...at the earliest.
- Okay.
All right?
I told him to expect us when he sees us.
Fine.
Yes?
Yes, thank you.
Etienne here.
The car has left.
Report to me as soon as contact is made.
They left home.
Was that Giles?
Yes, Giles.
You know, he isn't as simple as I thought he was.
That night he dragged me out of the workshop after Beynat left all the equipment set to explode, he told me I wouldn't have been in this mess if I'd minded my own business.
And he was right.
Fortunately, he did not mind his business either.
If he had not seen what he did that night, they would have got away with it.
But remember, none of this would have happened if you had not conspired to help a criminal lunatic escape.
I've already paid my penance for that, by allowing myself to be wrapped in bandages and stuck in a hospital.
How did you know what method Eve was going to use to get rid of me?
She could have slit my throat for all you knew, or cared.
But it worked, did it not?
Yes.
Good.
- They're heading for Les Baux.
- May I come, too?
Yes, of course.
Why are we going this way?
I have something to do first.
Will it take long?
No.
What are you doing?
You'll see.
What's happening, Eve?
There's someone who wants to see you.
To see me?
What about?
Shut up and get out.
You heard her.
Get out.
- Eve, please!
- Out!
Eve, who is this man?
Don't you recognize your father, my dear?
My father?
You're mad!
Who is he?
I am the man who helped your father to escape, my dear.
Then what happened to my father?
I killed him.
He was dead before we even came over the wall, my dear.
Now come on.
What are you going to do?
Anything I may have to do will be your own fault, my dear.
Eve and I had the whole thing planned down to the last detail.
We talked about it now for two years, every tlme she me to vlslt that mdmn who was your father.
If you had been content to let things lie, this wouldn't have been necessary.
Eve would have joined me in a week or two and everything would have been all right.
Wouldn't it...
She can't get out that way.
Good.
Annette!
You won't get away!
I've got you now.
Be careful, Henri.
It's a long way down, Annette.
Henri.
Geoff! Geoff!
Annette, don't move.
I'm coming up.
Pack the books tightly, Mark, we don't want to leave any behind.
Mark! Stop that!
It is what men say, Miss.
It's not true.
Nothing like that can happen to you.
They're just trying to wear us down.
This continual noise...
Come on, let's get the other things.
I don't think anything can happen to us now.
As a matter of fact I know it can't.
They probably know that help is on its way as much as we do.
Oh, more books, Mark.
Oh dear, but...
There's... so much to pack and so...
Come on, get some desks.
No good, Miss. He come now.
They're just trying to terrorise us, that's all.
That his sign.
That say he come.
No, he'll eat your soul.
Nothing can eat your soul.
Adam! Mark!
Come back here!
Don't...
Adam!
I wonder, are there any messages for me?
I'll check, Sir.
Would you come this way, please, Madam?
Your coat, Madam?
- Miss Gwen Mayfield?
- Yes.
- How do you do? I'm Alan Bax.
- How do you do?
- Please sit down, won't you?
- Thank you.
- Er... waiter!
- Sir.
- We'd like some tea.
- Please.
- And anything to eat?
- No, thank you.
No? Just tea then.
- It was good of you to come.
- It was good of you to ask me.
We had a lot of replies to the advertisement.
- Oh?
- But there was something about yours.
Exceptional.
That's why I suggested meeting.
Your background sounded more interesting, your work in Africa.
Yes, well, er... my letters told you all about me.
I've been teaching since I came back to England.
Yours is a church school?
Er... no, a private school.
Just for the village.
My family founded it many years ago.
- Private?
- Oh, the salary's good.
Oh, I didn't mean...
Well, I know about private schools, but ours is well-endowed.
We're a rich family, I'm afraid... or used to be.
Not quite so rich now, and that's just my sister and myself.
And we both felt... someone who's worked abroad might stimulate the children's minds.
- Was it a mission school in Africa?
- Yes.
Now, you mentioned a breakdown in health.
Well, I did have, but I'm perfectly all right now, thank you.
Well, I'm sorry to have to...
Well, of course you do.
I understand.
- When 0ne's dealing with children...
- Mr Bax, I'm completely well now, I...
Well, I mean, there were special circumstances, you see.
A tribal rebellion, and things got out of hand.
It wasn't the people's fault, the...
It was the witch-doctors who led them.
You see, they wanted us out, and they used horrible ways, I...
I can't, I mean...
Well, what happened, ljust can't...
You'll like Heddaby,
Miss Mayfield.
It's a remarkably attractive village, though I've known it all my life, of course, but it really is.
We've taken care of it, you see.
And the schoolhouse - you'll like that, too, I know you will.
- Do you mean... I've got the job?
- If you want it.
- Goodbye.
- See you tomorrow.
- Erm...
- Can I help you, Miss?
Yes, please.
Which way is the schoolhouse?
- Just round the corner.
- Round there. Hm, thanks.
- You the new head teacher?
- Yes, I am.
- Pleased to meet you, Miss.
- Thank you.
(Girl) Miss Mayfield.
Oh.
- Welcome to Heddaby.
- Thank you.
They told me to say that the very first.
- I'm Valerie. Valerie Creek, that is.
- How do you do?
- Er, can I take your bags?
- Oh yes, please.
- Afternoon, Miss.
- Good afternoon.
I'm Dowsett.
I look after your garden for you.
It's lovely.
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Mmh.
They do look after it.
Old Miss Westleton, what I was here till now, she never had to do a thing.
They wouldn't let her.
Mr Bax, he says to me this morning,
"Now, see everything's perfect for Miss Mayfield when she comes."
Mind you, I...
I didn't expect you so soon, like...
I would have had tea all ready.
Still, I'll er...
I'll make it in a minute.
Here's the bedroom.
You all right then?
More than all right, thank you... Valerie?
Yes, Valerie.
I come in every day.
Er... do you want to see it all right away?
- No, you make tea. I'll explore.
- All right.
Ah...
Hello, puss. Hello.
Does the cat belong here?
Oh... no, he don't.
But he's hung about all day.
Maybe he's looking for a new home.
Pretty boy.
You like it here too, do you?
How far is the rectory?
- The rectory, Miss?
- I thought I'd pay my respects to Mr Bax.
Oh, you mean the Bax's house.
Is it far from here?
Why, it's just up the lane and around.
I'll show you after tea, Miss.
(Gwen) I'm Miss Mayfield.
(Woman) Please come in.
Miss Mayfield?
I'm Stephanie Bax,
Alan's sister.
- How do you do?
- I've been so longing to meet you.
Will you come into my study?
Excuse the mess.
I'm in the middle of an article.
- Sorry I Interrupted you.
- Not a bit. It deserved interrupting.
It just won't jell.
Well, perhaps it will tomorrow, you never know.
- Will you have a drink?
- Please.
Gin? Or there's er... oh dear, gin again, or...
Oh no, it's not possible - more gin.
Well, let's call it a very dry Martini.
- Will you sit down?
- Thank you.
Er, are you the Stephanie Bax?
"The"? Oh dear!
I knew your name straight away, but I wasn't sure it was the same person.
I read your articles in the Sunday papers - I really do.
And agree with every single word?
- N0.
- That's better.
- Do you often disagree?
- Sometimes. Violently.
I think you'll like it here.
It's primitive, septic tanks and all that, but it's real.
- The church...
- What about it?
I looked for it on the way -
I couldn't see it.
Well, there isn't any.
- But surely...
- Alan?
- Isn't he the rector?
- The Reverend Alan Bax? No.
But the collar?
It's all perfectly harmless, really - you'll see.
Alan. Visitor.
Miss Mayfield. I'm sorry,
I didn't know you were here.
I was running a new tape.
Nice to see you again, Mr Bax.
At first I thought it was the real thing.
Well, it is the organ of Salisbury Cathedral.
Just as well we have no neighbours.
What a fascinating room this is.
Alan's the collector, not me.
I have no visual sense.
Actually, most of it belonged here, didn't it, Alan?
- This lovely lady...
- From the old church.
But I thought you er...
- Oh yes, there was once.
- I'd like to show it to you.
Well, what there is left of it.
Why don't you stay to supper?
Oh, I'd like to, but there's a meal waiting for me.
Oh... well, next time.
And soon please, because we're determined to see lots of you.
- That's very kind of you, Miss Bax.
- May we drop the formality?
Gwen, Alan, Stephanie.
Thank you both.
I know I'm going to love Heddaby.
I'll see you home.
How long has it been like this?
- Almost 200 years.
- Hmm.
It was damaged.
They didn't try to rebuild it.
Just let it go.
Did a storm do it?
Did Stephanie tell you about me?
About my not being a priest?
I rather wish she had.
There's nothing wrong in it, you know.
I don't try to officiate or persuade anyone, but...
I wanted to enter the church, but I failed.
Somehow it's just the collar, just sometimes it...
...gives a feeling of security.
Mr Bax?
Alan?
Well, I'll say good night, then.
- Miss Westleton...
- Not so fat either.
How can I get you all sorted out if you talk at once.
Let's start with you.
- What's your name?
- I'm not in your class.
- Whose class are you in?
- Hers!
Miss Mayfield?
I'm Sally Benson.
I bet you thought you'd have to start term without me - tinies and all.
I am sorry - I just got back from France, and the boat was held up in fog.
Never mind, we'll have a proper talk later.
Come along my lot.
Come on through, come on.
- This one belongs to you, too.
- Yes.
Come on.
Come on through, come on.
Come on, hurry.
- Maureen Crovvther.
- Present, Miss.
- Ronnie Dowsett.
- Present, Miss.
- Mary Parker.
- Present, Miss.
- Gordon Parker.
- Present, Miss.
Linda Rigg? Linda?
Present, Miss.
Linda, what have you got there?
This, Miss.
A doll. Don't you think you're a bit big for that?
You put it away.
Now I shall try very hard to remember all your names, but it's going to be easier for you because you've only got one to remember, and that's Miss Mayfield.
Yes, Miss Mayfield.
You sit there while you drink your milk.
I'll be back in a moment.
How he's wept - have you heard him?
- His first day, too.
- Yes.
Are you getting them sorted out?
I'm trying to, but they all look alike.
That's the Heddaby face.
Inbred for centuries. Appalling.
- All except that rather darker one.
- Who? Ronnie Dowsett?
They're very thick those two.
Well, good luck to them.
- Do you like Heddaby?
- Yes, don't you?
Mmh, not to live in.
My boyfriend lives in town.
Still, it's very restful.
Good for the soul, as they say.
It's a nice place to get over things.
I mean, well, it's unhurried, among nice simple people.
Well, all good fresh meat here,
Miss Mayfield.
None of that frozen stuff.
Leave that to the Eskimos, I say.
It chills good hot blood - eh, my dear?
(Chuckles) Speak for yourself, she says.
How much?
Six bob. (Laughs)
Six shillings.
Oh, he's a right good 'un, this one.
He'll jug out fine.
Just remember now and do him good and slow.
There!
That's all.
Thank you.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Mayfield.
Hello.
- Good morning, Joe.
- Good morning, Miss Mayfield.
Good morning, Linda.
Good morning, Ronnie.
Good morning, Miss Mayfield.
- Here's your tuppence ha'penny change.
- Thank you.
- Oh, Miss Mayfield.
- Valerie.
A right old squash in there, eh?
Every Saturday.
Oh, give me your order, look, and I'll bring it round later.
- Are you sure?
- I was going to finish off that bit of ironing.
- Oh, that's good of you, Valerie.
- l'vejust got to help my mum out first.
Hello there, Miss Mayfield.
- How's she making out?
- Oh, she spoils me.
- Won't let me lift a finger, Mrs Creek.
- That's right.
My Val was brought up to hard, work.
Eh, girl?
Oh, you're a terror, mum.
I can wind her round my little finger, really.
- You give the game away.
- (Val laughs)
Mum.
Did you see anything like that?
Linda Rigg, your granny was in here looking for you not half an hour since.
- Granny?
- Left to run her own errands.
You better go and find her.
- Oh, I expect she just forgot.
- No, she never.
You tell her you're sorry.
And you, boy...
You let her go.
Did you see that then?
Courting!
Well, they were just looking at the things.
Mere kids.
They'll take watching.
Oh, don't you worry, mum.
Miss Mayfield'll keep an eye on 'em.
- I'll do what's right.
- Course you will. You lay it on.
- I'll bring these round later.
- Thank you.
- Ronnie.
- Yes, Miss?
Are you going my way?
I'd like to have a word with you.
About that essay you wrote yesterday.
Oh?
It turned out to be more of a story than an essay, didn't it?
- I suppose it did.
- Oh, don't worry about it. I liked it.
It was really quite remarkable in its way.
And you didn't need me to tell you it was good, now, did you? (Chuckles)
- Gordon Parker.
- Present.
Linda Rigg.
Lin... Does anyone know why Linda's absent today?
All right, then.
Er... geograPhY-
Sandra, how long did you spend on your homework? Three minutes?
- N0, Miss Mayfield.
- Less than that?
Ronnie, did you write this?
It isn't my writing.
N0, and it's not your spelling either,
I'm glad to say, butjust the same - did you?
Ronnie, tell me.
Is this some kind of bad joke?
No. It's true.
That Linda's grandmother is cruel to her?
- Now, did Linda tell you that?
- I saw it.
You saw what?
They were in the wash house, and she thought I'd gone.
I looked.
She stuck Linda's hand in the rollers and turned the handle.
- What?
- She put Linda's hand in the mangle.
Mrs RiQQ?
- Hello?
- Mrs Rigg?
- Yes, that's right.
- I'm er...
Oh, I know who you are.
You're the new teacher.
- (Chuckles) Come in my dear.
- Thank you.
- Ah, Linda. Good afternoon.
- Hello, Miss Mayfield.
- Look what Gran gave me.
- Hmm. How nice for you to have.
Well, I'd half promised her, and with her feeling a bit poorly like ljust run over to Cogham for it.
Well, we were rather wondering why Linda hadn't been to school today.
Tell your teacher.
I hurt myself with the mangle.
I was wringing out some dolls clothes, see?
I dunno -
Gran says I'm cack-handed.
Clumsy that is, Miss.
She is too sometimes, bless her.
Well, I couldn't find no bones broken, so I just gave her a herb brew to give a good night's sleep.
Slept right through, I did.
Gran's a wonderful one with herbs!
The old ways, Miss.
They served when there were no doctors, and they serve still.
Ever had a poultice made of mouldy bread?
No, I don't think I have.
But you've had this penicillin though, haven't you?
- Oh yes.
- It's the same thing.
She makes wine and all.
Give her a glass of your cowslip, Gran.
Won the Women's Institute prize.
Anything Gran put in for she always wins.
Except the chutney, love.
Don't forget the chutney.
Is Ronnie all right?
Yes, he is, but he's worried about you.
- Did he tell you about this then?
- He's mentioned it.
He shouldn't have.
He shouldn't have been hanging around here at all.
We don't want anything to do with him, do we, Gran?
That Ronnie Dowsett?
No, we do not, and that's a fact.
He's no good, that boy.
He's going right ahead to be another layabout like his father.
Now...
- Miss Mayfield.
- Thank you.
- Just a drop for you, pet.
- Looks delicious.
There.
Ronnie Dowsett - he seems like a bright, decent boy.
Ah - "seems".
They're both getting to a certain age, and I won't have him messing about with my Linda.
- Oh, but...
- No, it's all right.
I've had it out with her.
I won't have her go the same way as her mother.
I've had it happen once.
Never again.
She understands.
- Of course. You have a right...
- I have, and I must use it.
Well...
I must go.
Thank you for the wine, Mrs Rigg, and Linda - hope to see you in school tomorrow.
Oh, here's my cat.
He must have followed me here.
- Yours, Miss?
- Mmh, he's adopted rne.
I haven't a name for him yet, but I think I'll call him Smokey.
(Chuckles) You're mistaken, Miss.
I've had him five years.
He's my Vesper. My lovely boy.
Aren't you, love?
But he comes to my house.
D0 you Vesper'?
Bad boy. You never told me.
- Well... bye, Mrs Rigg.
- Goodbye, Miss.
(Whispers) Go after her.
- (Gwen) Finished?
- Yes, Miss Mayfield.
Right, then bring it here and the pamphlet, too.
Did you find, it difficult?
Well, no, just a bit different from anything I've done.
What's it for?
Well, it's a... a kind of test.
That's all I'll tell you for now.
Good night, Ronnie.
Good night, Miss Mayfield.
Oh, Miss Mayfield.
I'm so very, very grateful to you.
But surely you knew he was clever?
Yes, but... well, I thought maybe that was just a mother's pride.
But now you've proved it's really in him.
Our boy's going to have his chance.
We'd better be practical.
- Oh, yes... yes.
- Not count our chickens.
I'm afraid he's very far behind, and he'll have to make it up.
Now, there are two possibilities.
One is the suggestion of Mr Bax that he go to a cramming school, a good one.
Oh, there'd be nothing to pay.
Mr Bax will see to everything.
It's a very generous offer.
He'd er... he'd have to live away from home?
- Yes, it's a boarding school.
- Leave Heddaby?
Just because you never would?
We're talking about the boy's whole career.
Yes, I know, but er...
Well, what do you say, Miss?
I mean, you know him.
Frankly, I think he'd be miserable.
He'd find himself so far behind that he might lose heart.
- And if he stayed here?
- Then I'd coach him myself.
Could you?
We'd have to work hard, both of us, but he'd be taught, not crammed, and he wouldn't lose confidence,
I'd see to that.
He'd have to have a lot of homework, and you'd have to be sure that he did it.
I mean, it's really up to all of us.
Perhaps you'd like to think it over?
Oh, I reckon not, Miss.
If you take him on, us'll help.
Fine.
I hope Mr Bax won't think that we're ungrateful.
No, I'm sure he won't.
- Good night, Mr Bax.
- Good night, Sir.
- Good night, Miss Mayfield.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr Dowsett.
- Good night, Miss.
What is it?
It would have been better if he'd gone.
Thank you.
Ooh.
Aah.
About the essay.
I want your very best effort, mind you, not just something you can get away with.
All right, Miss Mayfield.
And you do understand you're going to have to work very hard?
Intensive study, no distractions.
- You mean Linda?
- Mmh, for one.
D0 you want me to stop going around with her?
Well, it might be better.
- For my work?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, Alan.
Go on, say it.
'None today, thank you.'
- (Chuckles) What's all that?
- Just some stuff for the pageant.
- The what?
- The school pageant.
- There's always one in June, isn't there?
- Yes, Sir.
Nobody told me. Am I supposed to make costumes and things?
And write it and produce it.
Traditional duty of the head teacher.
As they say,
"That's show business."
Well, I'll try. After all, there's always a first time.
Good night, Ronnie.
Good night, Miss Mayfield.
Good night, Sir.
Alan, there's something
I wanted to ask you.
Why did you say it would be better for Ronnie to leave?
I meant easier.
- Easier for whom?
- Well, for you.
Well, I was going about it too, but rather in a gentler way, yet it doesn't seem to be for Ronnie's sake.
It's really to keep them both apart, and yet it's not for Linda's sake either.
Why, Alan?
Why is it so desperately important?
- Hello there! How's it going?
- Oh, it's chaotic.
This is supposed to be the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
Does it lean enough?
(Laughs) It looks most dangerous.
- Want to come and watch?
- Dogs. Not to be put off.
- Well, see you later then.
- Right. Bye! Good luck.
Now then, where's erm...
Where's Galileo?
- I'm Wilbur.
- Where's Linda?
- (Ronnie) What have you done with it?
- It disappeared.
- Don't be stupid. It can't just disappear.
- Well, it did.
- I know: you slung it away somewhere.
- I never.
You are mad because
I didn't turn up yesterday.
- I lost it!
- But where?
If I knew where it wouldn't be lost, stupid.
What's all this about?
- She threw away that boy doll I gave her.
- I never.
Now come along, Linda.
You're Signor Galileo, remember?
I don't want to be in it, Miss.
Please!
- Oh, nonsense. Everybody's in it.
- I don't want to be a man.
There are hardly any girl's parts because hardly any girls invented anything.
Now get up there and try it.
I've written you a jolly good part now, and you'll feel better when you get your moustache on.
Here it is.
Come on, here are the props.
Now then, "l, Galileo, here am bent."
I, Galileo, here am bent.
"On a scientific experiment."
On a scientific experiment.
All men do bicker about which falls quicker - a pound of feathers or a pound of lead.
Look out below there, mind your head.
Linda, give me that moustache.
- What about your homework?
- I dodged it.
- Miss Mayfield'll be mad.
- Oh, let her.
She'd be madder still if she knew.
- What?
- That you were here.
She don't like me.
- What's the matter?
- Shh...
(Gwen) Ronnie Dowsett.
Does anyone know what's the matter with Ronnie. Linda?
No, Miss Mayfield.
- Mrs Dowsett, what is it?
- I can't talk now. I got to go with him.
What happened?
He was took bad in the night.
It didn't seem like anything.
Bit of a headache, touch of fever, that's all.
This morning he seemed to be sleeping peaceful enough, but the wife would have the doctor along, see, and...
He took one look at him and he said,
"That boy's in a coma."
- A coma?
- Sort of... unnatural sleep he meant.
Well, he didn't waste any time after that.
I told him yesterday I'd fix this.
I didn't go along.
His mum's along, that's enough.
- What do they think it is?
- They don't know yet.
But my wife, she's got some funny notions.
She's a Welsh woman.
Last year she took shingles all round here, you know - very painful, and she got it into her head that it was done to her.
- Done to her?
- Mmh.
That somebody had done it, you see, on purpose.
- Just because she'd had a row with her.
- A row?
Mmh... about Ronnie that was.
- With whom?
- Old Granny Rigg.
(Sally) Don't go too far ahead!
(Gwen) No nettles here now.
(Sally) Come along, you stragglers, or Mr Curd'll be after us.
Come along, Sue.
(Gwen) Oh, look there - lovely shade.
Shall we go over there?
(Sally) Not too much noise now.
You'll frighten the sheep.
(Gwen) All right now, let's start with first things first, shall we?
Erm... the man and the wheel and the dinosaur.
Who's the dinosaur?
You're the din... you are.
All right. Here we go...
NOW!
I know what you want.
All right again!
All my life
I've sat here in this swamp.
It's very muggy and extremely damp.
And when I get depressed
I can only roar.
What else can I do?
I'm a dinosaur.
All right. Roar!
Who's this?
What's he rolling round and round...
- (Girl) Look, Miss Mayfield...
- What's the matter?
There's something up there.
- I can't reach.
- What is it?
- That's Linda's doll.
- It's got no head!
Ooh!
- Look!
- Look at that!
I'll give it back to you later, Linda.
But look at this - stuck full of pins and its head missing.
- What do you think it could possibly be?
- Witchcraft?
- Hmmm
- Somebody having a little dabble?
Yes, I would think so.
Or did you think I was going to say,
"No, no, no, it can't happen here?"
I bet there are lots of remote spots where remnants of witchcraft are still practised.
Places like Heddaby in fact.
I've often wondered.
- What are we going to do?
- Do? Ah...
Well, I'd like to start by removing those pins.
Yes, we could...
Oh, no. Emphatically not.
Do you see why?
Well, that would mean admitting belief in it - to ourselves, I mean.
- Oh, I see.
- I did some articles on witches once.
No, not witches - damn them - people who thought they were witches.
The psychology of it.
It's a sex thing deep down of course.
Mostly women go in for it- older women.
Like er... Mrs Rigg for instance?
Yes. They relish the idea of a secret power, especially when their normal powers are failing.
Now, they may believe in it.
The point is do we ?
What are we giving in to if we admit the possibility that a healthy young kid can be put in hospital by mere ill will?
- That's where it gets fascinating.
- I see.
What we admit we believe and what we believe, I suppose, could destroy us.
Oh, beautifully put.
Did you ever write anything?
- Well, I...
- I've got it.
Why don't we collaborate on an article together?
- You... 0h, I couldn't.
- You could!
Nobody better.
About these very things.
Fetish men in Africa, witchcraft in England.
There may be more in common than people think.
It's very good for a Sunday magazine, too.
- Oh, I'd love to!
- Good. It's settled. We'll split the fee.
Really, we could help each other.
Writing's good, you know. It heals.
And right now Ronnie Dowsetfs probably responding fast to penicillin.
But we'll hang on to this for the illustrations.
Miss Mayfield!
- That thing... how did it get here?
- What thing?
Oh, this little duster?
I've been wondering where I put it.
Kind of a feather duster...
Did you buy it?
No, it's one of the things
Mr Bax had sent.
Oh. Took a pill, did you?
No wonder.
I had a cousin of mine who used to take pills - made her walk in her sleep.
Fancy!
Nowjust you wait -
I'll get you a nice cup of tea.
Oh, Mr Dowsett.
I didn't expect you this morning.
I just thought I'd do a bit... keep my mind off things.
- Any news?
- Just the same.
It's three days now.
They're making tests, they say.
Yes, I know,
Miss Benson's been calling.
His mum's been up the hospital all the hours that's in.
I went there yesterday myself.
Did you see him?
He didn't know me.
Mr Dowsett...
Well, these things take time.
He's in good hands.
They're bound to find the trouble.
- Er, Valerie...
- Yes, Ma'am?
Could you make Mr Dowsett some tea and some breakfast?
Thank you.
- Oh, I took him that bat.
- Good.
- Mrs Dowsett.
- What do you want?
I was going to the hospital to see how Ronnie was.
They won't let you - only me, because I'm his mother.
- I only wanted to know how he was.
- They won't tell you anything.
They don't know anything.
Them and their tests.
- He just lies there.
- ls he worse?
He's as well as can be expected.
That's what they say.
Expect!
What do you expect then?
He'd be sitting up, laughing and chatting...
God, I wish I knew.
- Let me give you a lift home.
- No, I can go by bus.
Oh no, the car's just here.
You'll be home in a minute.
Come along.
What do you think is the trouble with Ronnie?
How would I know?
But you're his mother.
You must have an instinct.
Perhaps.
Do you think it's a natural illness?
I always took good care of him.
Always.
Why shouldn't it be?
Mrs Dowsett, I don't know if this means anything to you, but yesterday
I found a doll in the fork of a tree.
- Doll?
- Hmm.
It was stuck full of pins, and the head was missing.
I... I don't know what you mean - talking about dolls.
What... what kind of silly talk is that?
Well, last year you had the shingles.
- Shingles? I don't remember.
- Your husband told me.
Shingles. Dolls.
You're just trying to mix me up, that's all.
You're trying to upset me.
- Put me down.
- But I...
Just put me down here.
But I'm only thinking what's best for Ronnie.
You only want to interfere.
He could have gone away to that school.
He'd have been out of it by this.
But oh no, you had to butt in and do things your way.
- Believe me, it's for Ronnie's good.
- His good?
Do you call it his good where he is now?
Who's that?
Oh, Mr Dowsett.
I... I seen your light.
- Can I come in?
- Please do.
You've heard?
About Ronnie?
Yes, isn't it wonderful news?
Hmm.
You've been celebrating.
When is he coming home?
- They've gone.
- What?
Both of them.
She packed up her things.
Said she was taking the boy straight off to her folks in Wales. See?
Your wife said that?
The boy must never come back here, she said.
It'd finish him, she said.
So, that was it.
She said to me, she said, you can come with us or stay, just as you like, but we're off.
- It means his life, that's what she said.
- Of course.
I... I can't just go like that.
All my life I lived here.
- I didn't forbid her. Should I have?
- No.
What can have happened?
I... think I can tell you.
What?
Well, go on then... go on!
Last evening your wife went to visit old Mrs Rigg.
- Did you know that?
- No.
And together, lthink, some sort of bargain was struck.
What bargain?
I don't know. I'm not sure.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to find out.
I'm going to see old Granny Rigg.
- I'm going to find out!
- Mr Dowsett...
Let me past.
I got to phone the police.
- It's West Dowsett. He's dead.
- Mr Dowsett?
Yeah, I found him up in the sheep field there, in the pond. Drowned.
Drowned?
But I saw him last night.
He must have fell in drunk.
- Did you see him in here last night?
- He was well away.
Where did you see him?
He came by the school house last night.
We had a word.
That must have been late.
Didn't he come to see you?
Me, Miss? Come to see me?
Oh, I only wish he had, poor soul.
I'd have helped him.
Sent him home sober - not like some people.
Gwen, my dear.
Dodo! Thatcher! Come here!
Come here at once!
You bad dogs. Sit!
They broke away and wouldn't answer - they've never done it before. Are you hurt?
- No, it's nothing. I'm glad you came.
- Let me help you.
No, there's something
I wanted to show you.
- Oh, what?
- Well, there were footprints.
Oh, the sheep...
They're gone.
Well, the man who found poor Dowsett probably left marks.
N0, there were others.
Bare feet.
Mr Dowsett wasn't here alone last night.
He went from me to old Mrs Rigg.
Suppose he interrupted something, and they...
They brought him here to the pond and drowned him.
- They? Who?
- There were lots of them there.
I saw it on their faces this morning.
They knew that I knew.
Well, how many do you think there were - judging by the footprints you saw?
- Ten? A dozen?
- Mmh. Easily.
A coven - that's the technical word for it.
Yes, maybe he did happen on a little witchcraft session. It's possible.
- Then you agree it could happen?
- lt has to be taken seriously.
There'll be an inquest, there'll have to be.
I'll go to it and tell them all I know about Mr Dowsett's drowning and the bargain made to keep the family out of the village.
What they did to the boy.
- Why... why was it?
- What do you mean?
- To keep Ronnie away from Linda.
- It looks like it.
Yes, but witchcraft doesn't work that way.
Quite the opposite.
There's only one reason they'd want to keep her untouched...
To be a ritual sacrifice!
Gwen. You must be careful.
You must be sure what you're saying, or they'll laugh at you.
Not these people, the others - the papers.
"School teacher alleges witchcraft ritual."
- Are you Miss Gwen Mayfield?
- Yes.
I think you might be able to help us.
I'll say all I have to say at the inquest in public in front of everyone.
Look, Miss...
That's enough.
Until then I'll take care of her.
Yes, that's all right now -
I was right.
No need for a stitch, that's going to heal perfectly.
Now, you may get a slight lowness from the anti-toxin, but that's better than tetanus.
Now you take that and get a good night's sleep.
They work.
I'll take this to be repaired straight away.
I'm sure they can do it.
Thank you.
When is the inquest?
The day after tomorrow, Monday.
Now you get some rest.
Stephanie!
Stephanie, where are you?
What's happened?
Where is this?
- It's all right.
- I was in the mission hut.
Just lie quite still.
There's nothing to worry about.
- Lie still.
- ls this Africa?
You're English.
Are we on the coast? Where?
Fully conscious just now, Doctor.
- First time?
- Yes, Doctor.
Doctor?
Do you remember me?
I've been looking after you here for a while.
- It's a nursing home.
- This isn't the coast, it's too cool.
No, no, no, you're in England,
Miss Mayfield.
Safe home in England.
You had a rough time, but you're recovering nicely.
I can't remember since the mission hut.
Oh, that's all over.
It's a long time ago.
Long? How long?
Days? Weeks?
It's over a year,
Miss Mayfield.
A Year?
Now, you must rest again.
Well, if I have been here over a year,
I must have had work to do,
- I must have friends.
- Yes, you have friends.
Are my friends paying for me to stay here?
Yes.
Who are they? What's their names?
I have a right to know!
Please, Miss Mayfield, relax.
Let me explain.
You had a recurrence of the breakdown you had in Africa, all right?
And you're still fragile.
You mustn't force things.
You simply must not strain after the names of people and places.
Your memory will come back if it wants to.
At the moment
I don't think it does.
But that happens.
There are much worse things. (Chuckles)
Nowjust rest assured that you have friends, and they will look after you - always.
Come along.
We have someone new today.
This is Miss Mayfield.
This is Mr Glass,
Mrs McDowall... and Miss Walkinshaw.
You're the one that lost her memory.
I've got veins.
- Yes?
- Oh, Miss Mayfield
I saw you at the window.
All right, are you?
- Who was that with you?
- A friend.
- Another doctor?
- No, just a friend.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Like to see her? You can.
- No.
Anyway, you heard.
She saw you, but...
It seems to be total, whatever caused her relapse.
Yes, whatever did.
Well...
Future plans -
I think in the circumstances we'll...
Mr Glass.
- Miss Walkinshaw.
- Oh, there it goes again.
Oh, wretched thing.
We really will have to get this fixed.
There you are.
- (Nurse) Mrs McDowall.
- Yes?
Look who's come to visit you!
Your little granddaughter.
Oh Julie, how lovely to see you!
Oh my, what a beautiful dolly.
(Julie) Yes, she's new.
I only got her today.
I call her Susan.
What a lovely name.
She is nice, isn't she?
(Whispers) Heddaby.
- What did you say'?
- Oh. l-l'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
It's all right, it's all right.
It's only cake. Don't worry about it.
You're a little bit tired I think.
We'll get you back to your room.
(Whispers) Inquest.
Inquest.
Drowned footprints in the...
Girl.
The girl.
Keep her a virgin, because...
But do you still remember nothing about your life in England?
There's nothing... nothing at all comes to mind?
Well, what I've come to say is this: it's time for you to leave here.
Your friends have suggested it.
This place is expensive as you've no doubt gathered.
But luckily I've connections with another rest home.
- Where?
- Cornwall. It's a farm, really.
You'd do simple work there.
In effect look after yourself.
Be far healthier for you than here.
A natural life without any strain or pressure.
- You'd stand the best chance.
- I'll think about it, Doctor Wallis.
You've never spoken my name before.
Oh, I knew it soon enough.
One of the nurses has a crush on you.
All right.
Well, shall we say tomorrow morning?
Here you are, Miss Mayfield.
Your clothes.
Don't you recognise them?
They are yours, you know.
Now, let's see - you have to be off at ten o'clock.
I should put them on now if I were you.
You'll find they do fit.
Could you give me a lift, please?
- Dr Wallis wants this mended right away.
- Yeah, jump in.
Oh, thank you.
(Man) Look out there!
What do you think you're playing at?
Why, Miss Mayfield! (Chuckles)
Are you going to Heddaby?
Well, can I give you a lift?
Now come 0n now, you needn't be shy with me.
Well, fancy running into you like that.
Ooh, what am I saying?
I nearly made a job of it, didn't I?
But you're the last person
I expected to see.
- You've been ill, haven't you?
- Yes, I was.
Ah, people in the village were very sad to hear about it.
In hospital, were you?
- A nursing home. It wasn't very serious.
- Ah, good. Well, that's good to hear.
You're still a little pale though, but you get out in the sunshine in this lovely weather.
Well, I've just got to stop off at the shop a minute. I shan't be long.
Hello, Miss Mayfield.
Nice to see you again.
Now don't you get talking to any strange men now. (Laughs)
I heard you were in hospital.
- Nice to see you back, Miss Mayfield.
- Thank, you.
- Oh, Mrs Curd.
- They've got the girl.
I just got to drop this off at the Bax's.
They'll be surprised to see you all right.
Doctor Wallis, you've got here quickly.
Oh, my dear.
I'm so relieved.
I was worried when he told me you'd gone.
You must be tired.
Come in and rest.
Which way did you come?
Well, I had to hitch rides.
I had no money, you see.
I see.
Well, you must be perished.
What will you drink?
No, no. No alcohol.
I wouldn't advise it.
Really, Doctor Wallis, your advice.
Some food then. ls that allowed?
Did they feed you in that place?
- Yes, quite well.
- Well, that's something.
From what I've been hearing...
Now, what was all this about her going to Cornwall?
Well, it seemed to me, as she wasn't progressing, that would be the best place for her to go.
But she was progressing the whole time, only you didn't spot it!
All you did was to warn me not to go near her for fear of upsetting her.
- Professional advice.
- Oh really, Miss Bax.
And that nursing home needs looking into.
- Stephanie!
- I mean it.
Liz, some food for Miss Mayfield please - tasty and hot. I leave it to you.
And coffee.
Lots of it. Quick.
- We let you down.
- Oh no, I owe you...
We owed you more care than you evidently got.
Ever since that night here.
Do you remember?
Alan found you.
- He did?
- In the doorway of your room. Flat out.
He called for me.
All I can remember is having a horrible nightmare, I...
Take it easy now.
Let it go, relax.
I must have been on the verge of a nervous breakdown for a long time.
I kept imagining wild things, that people were witches...
She's staying here.
She's still convalescent, you know.
She needs care.
She'll get it here.
Ring me if I'm needed.
Was there an accident to a man?
- Dowsett. He drowned.
- Oh.
But there was an inquest.
That's when you were ill.
The verdict was misadventure.
This isn't the room you were in before because of... well, associations.
Couldn't be better, thank you.
Now, don't worry.
I'm just next door.
And Liz'll bring the rest of your things up in the morning.
- Thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Pleasant dreams.
It's good to have you back again, Gwen.
It's good to be here.
Mrs Rigg. Mrs Rigg.
Mrs RiQQ?
~ Uh?
' M's Rigs?
On! on, it's you.
I didn't expect to see you.
- Have a glass of my wine.
- No. No, thank you.
It's good.
Yes, I know it is.
I had some the first time I came here.
A lot's happened since then, hasn't it?
I mean...
Well, I came to enquire after Linda.
My Linda?
Oh, if onlyl knew what had happened to...
Well, she... she's on holiday, Miss.
Gone to her cousin's in Great Yarmouth.
Yes, the sea air'll do her good, you know.
L-l'm just finishing a dress for her, ready for next term.
- Well, I came to see how Linda is.
- Ah, yes.
Oh, here you are, Sir.
It's all ready for you.
Linda.
You did this?
- I had to.
- Why?
Come away from here.
Stephanie!
I willed you to come, and you came.
I came...
You came to join us, and you shall.
Alan, leave us.
Get down on your knees.
Bow down. Bow down.
(Curd) Now you're one of us.
I'm sorry about all the drama up there.
It's necessary, you know.
A sort of group release.
I can go to the police.
You'?
Straight out of a nursing home.
That place was quite genuine by the way, dear Doctor Wallis and all.
I'd take my chance.
No, I don't think so.
You're much too vulnerable in every way.
Is that why you chose me?
Yes, of course.
And now that you're one of us
I can tell you everything.
I shall enjoy that.
Come along.
Where does this lead?
The house. Escape route for the priests in the old days.
Was it witchcraft then, too?
Oh, yes.
It's an old local custom.
I got on to it years ago through Granny Rigg.
Mrs Rigg?
She made the Dowsett boy sick?
Correct.
That's about her level.
But I have studied it as a science.
Come on.
Poor Alan - he's so loyal.
He knows.
But he can't bear it.
What does he know?
All my life I have tried to push my brain to the limit.
To get all the ideas and the reach out of it, and put them at the service of mankind.
Do you believe that?
- Yes.
- Oh, you must.
Because only now that the end of my life is in sight do I feel that I am really learning.
If only I could live a second lifetime - just another fifty years...
All the things I could do for the world!
A second lifetime - that isn't possible.
But it is.
And I have found out how.
What's that?
The only existing copy of the works of Brother Johann of Wilrzburg.
Fourteenth Century.
- Do you read Latin?
- I used to, er...
Good.
No.
Yes.
It's what you think it is.
And I have translated the rhyme.
Grow me a gown with golden down
Cut me a robe from toe to lobe
Give me a skin, for dancing in
Of course it won't be pleasant, and I loathe the idea of it, but it's the necessary ritual.
But she's only a child!
Of no value at all.
Gwen, how can you compare us?
That little idiot...
...with my brain and my intelligence continuing into the 21st century.
Now, you understand, don't you?
Gwen, you could help me.
Someone intelligent- as fastidious as I am myself, and there's just time for you to learn the rites.
When is it going to happen?
Lammastide. Tomorrow night.
Tomorrow.
There are two men up on the hill.
I think they're watching the house.
That's right.
I set them there.
Do you mean they know what's going to happen tonight?
No, they're expecting a Sabbath.
A meeting.
A little orgy perhaps.
- They'll stop you when they find out.
- They won't be able to help themselves.
And neither will you.
D0 you really believe you could make this work?
I know it.
- Summon up the devil?
- Now, don't try to cheapen it with words.
Call it a power or a force that we are going to release.
Perhaps it's in yourself - something in you.
What does that matter?
You could touch an H bomb and say,
"l know what's in there, uranium and stuff... that is all."
But when it is triggered off...
This is a trigger mechanism, too.
Now, through it again - check every word.
(Tape) 'First let the seeker after life be solemnly warned,
'all things must be without stain.
'The maiden shall be pure, not above five and ten years of age.'
Fourteen years and nine months.
Verified by birth certificate.
- Where is she?
- Don't keep saying that.
You have to let me see her. ls she in the house?
You got her away from her grandmother, I know that.
How could she have let you?
Didn't she realise?
About this? Granny Rigg?
It's not in her league.
I think she does now.
Now she can't do a thing.
(Tape) 'Until the very moment of sacrifice, let all be kept pure.
'Let no single drop of blood be spilled in that place,
'nor other defilement, neither human nor any beast soever
'lest the whole dread power do turn against the seeker
'and destroy him utterly.
'Let the blade be one that has been much used for such purposes
'and has practice in it.'
You haven't one, you can't have.
From ancient Mexico.
A sacrificial knife.
D0 you know how many this killed on the altars?
Seven thousand!
So, what does one more matter?
It did the other duty, too.
After the blow be struck, give me a skin for dancing in.
Alan, where is the girl?
Alan, your sister's insane.
For her sake as well we've got to stop her.
Alan, you must help me.
Alan, where is Linda?
Stephanie, you can't hurt her.
She'll know nothing about it.
And remember to let her come up when it's time.
Or I'll send them for her.
Wake up, quick.
Quick!
Blood!
At the moment of sacrifice let no blood be spilled.
No!
My Linda.
It was there in her - all the time.
Oh hello, how are you?
Nice to see you.
Come along, little one, get ready. Good.
Now you all remember, I hope, your seats from last term.
Would you like to take them.
And you? Hello.
You go to Miss Benson's room, just the way you used to.
You too, darling.
- How's that?
- Oh, that's fine. Wonderful.
Sorry, ljust made it.
What's been happening?
Curd gone away, the general store's a supermarket...
Tell you later.
Has everybody been moving out or something?
The one who matters didn't.
Sir, are those loudspeakers?
Yes.

This is the beat of a human heart.
Sit very still and listen.
Is your heart beating in this same rhythm?
You are experiencing the heartbeat of a dying man.
And it is with death and dying that we concern ourselves.
What happens at the point of death.
What happens afterwards.
What happens after death
to someone who does not choose to... stay dead?
Someone like... Morella.
Whoa.
Ma'am... I have to get back to Boston.
Yes. Leave the trunk here, then. I'll have one of my father's servants carry it in.
Yes, ma'am.
Giddap.
Is anyone there?
Father?
Father?
Who are you?
Father?
- What?
- It's Lenora, Father.
You... are my father?
Yes.
What do you want here?
Shocked?
Disgusted?
No.
Are you all alone here?
I was... until you came.
- Father, I came to see you.
- Now you've seen me. Are you content?
That's all? That's all you have to say to me after 26 years of separation?
- Father, I came all the way from...
- I know.
I know you don't love me, father, that you put me from your life, except for 21 years of board and tuition money.
But I had hoped that we'd enjoy one brief visit together before I left your life entirely.
I have no way of getting back to Boston at the moment. May I stay?
Do as you wish.
Morella, my beloved wife, your murderer has returned.
Get away from her.
Father, has she been lying here all these years?
Do you hear me?
- Why did you come here?
- Don't touch me!
I'm not a helpless baby this time.
I'll go when I... when I choose.
When I...
Oh, my God! My God!
Why did I come here? Why?
- Try to understand.
- Oh, I understand.
No. You understand nothing.
You understand nothing!
When she died, I died with her.
All that remained of me was this... this walking corpse, this shell, this ghost of flesh.
She was my life.
And... I killed her.
- That's it, isn't it?
- Yes!
Oh, no.
No. She thought you did.
She said so on her deathbed.
She was so young.
So alive.
To die just a few months after giving birth to you - she couldn't accept it.
I hated you.
Oh, dear God, how I hated you!
I wanted to kill you.
I went into your nursery and I took you out of your cradle and I almost hurled you out of the window!
I wish you had.
What?
You're ill.
I have a few months left to live.
We're both dead now, Father.
I'm sorry.
In my 26th year, my father is finally concerned about me.
Did you ever stop to wonder just once in all those 26 years:
"Where is my daughter?
What is she doing? Is she happy?"
No.
Why should you wonder that?
After all, I'm only your child.
- I'll be leaving very soon.
- Lenora.
- No! No!
- Forgive me. Forgive me.
- No. No.
- Forgive me.
How long have you been alone?
I don't know, Lenora.
Go on, please. What happened then?
There's not much more to add.
It came as no surprise to me that my marriage ended in failure.
I'd failed before in my relationships with men, many times.
Many times.
I... cannot give, you see.
Yes.
How did she die, Father?
How did she die?
There was this party, and...
I knew that she was too weak to withstand the strain of it.
Yet she insisted.
She had to have this party.
She had to dress up in her finest gown and dance and sing.
Less than an hour after the party had begun, she collapsed.
I picked her up in my arms and I carried her up to her bedroom.
I put her on her bed.
Her face was white.
Oh, dear God, how white!
She was enraged, furious!
Even dying, she was enraged.
"It was the baby," she said.
She swore she'd avenge herself.
"It was the baby." She kept saying it over and over again. "It was the baby!"
And then... before even the doctor could arrive, she was dead.
Why did you not bury her?
I did, but I could not leave her there.
I could not.
The thought of imprisoning her beauty in a box, of putting her underneath the ground...
I was deranged, Lenora. Insane with grief.
I only wanted to kill myself.
I almost did kill myself, a dozen times.
I'll never know what kept me from it.
No, I... I could not bury her.
And now?
There's no reason not to do it now.
Will you stay for a while?
Please.
I know it's too late to make amends, but perhaps together we could find some sort of an answer.
Perhaps.
- Then you'll stay?
- If you really want me to.
Yes.
Then you've come home at last.
At last!
Help me!
Go away... Leave me...
Lenora, what is it? What can I do?
- Lenora, what's wrong?
- Let go...
Lenora!
Lenora!
Oh, no!
No!
How I envy you.
Sleep.
Now you are released.
Come back, Lenora. Come back.
Lenora?
Lenora?
Morella! Oh, my God!
Where's Lenora?
What have you done to her?
All these years I've waited to return.
All these years
I've waited to avenge myself.
And what is it that happens just before death
which leads inexorably to that death?
Our second tale provides one roguish answer to that question
in the story of a man who hated a cat:
The Black Cat.
Why don't you watch where I'm going?
♪ Who dat... knocking at the door?
Montresor?
Montresor?
Come down here.
And keep that beast away from me or I'll kick his head in!
I want some money.
There is none, Montresor.
"There is none, Montresor."
Always lying, it's a fact.
As if I wouldn't know you had more nest eggs than a chicken.
Get away from me, you repulsive creature!
And stay away from me!
Where's my money?
There is none, Montresor.
All right.
I'll find it.
Oh! Montresor!
If you don't give me the money,
I have to find it myself.
Oh.
Oh, I know where it is.
I know.
If I ever catch you again, you mangy, insufferable brute, I'll... I'll...
I'll tear your head off!
By the root!
Oh, you won't bite me.
Give me my money!
There is none, Montresor.
You haven't worked in 17 years.
Will you?
Has it been that long?
Oh, stop your silly tactics.
What about your sewing money?
- We need that for food.
- Food!
That's exactly what I want it for.
I drink my food!
Give me the money.
Thank you for looking into your heart.
We will starve now. That's all we have.
You've got a lot of money hidden all around the whole house. I know that.
He was so romantic... once.
I said get out! And stay out!
You pig, you. You... you dog!
How dare you throw me out!
If only I had a pistol.
If I had a pistol, I'd...
I'd probably sell it and buy myself more wine.
Oh, but really...
After all I've done for her, she should have given me more money.
There's just no gratitude.
Sir, would you help a veteran of the Revolutionary War?
Out of my way!
Pardon me, ladies, but could you spare a coin for a moral cripple?
Disgraceful!
Do you have some money for a dying man?
Go sleep it off.
No gratitude.
Hey.
I want money!
- Scum!
- You dirty money-grubber.
Just no gratitude.
No kindness.
Top of the morning, everybody!
My, what a nice bunch of gentlemen!
Look.Look.
Beautiful.
One moment, please.
Gentlemen. Quiet, everybody.
As we promised before, a treat for everyone.
A demonstration in expert wine tasting by none other than...
Mr. Fortunato Luchresi himself.
Bravo! Bravo!
As you know, gentlemen,
Mr. Luchresi is without doubt the foremost wine taster in the civilised world today.
Huh?
That's nonsense!
I can tell the taste of any wine just as well as he can.
Liar!
If we may proceed...
I said, I can tell the taste of any wine... just as well as anybody!
Afraid to try me, huh?
You coward!
You poseur.
I say call the police!
One moment!
Please.
Sir, unless you are intent on mere rabble-rousing, you have just made a most grave and serious accusation.
An accusation which I am prepared to follow up with action.
That is, if you care to take the risk.
We will take the risk.
- Oh?
- Oh, yes, yes.
My name is Fortunato Luchresi, at your service.
Montresor Herringbone!
What are we waiting for?
Bring on the wine.
Bring on the wine.
Pinot Noir, Burgundy,
Clos de Vougeot.
Vintage... 1838.
- Quite passable.
- Correct!
Give me more. Don't be so stingy.
Burgundy. Volnay, 1832. And... it's from the better slopes of the vineyard.
It's... it's very good.
Correct.
I don't believe it.
Mmm.
Mmm... Bordeaux... Cabernet...
Chateau Margaux.
Vintage... 1837.
A bit heavy for a Margaux.
Correct!
Mmm. Mmm!
Château Petit-Village...
It's very good.
Correct.
Well, I must say, you seem to know your wine, sir.
I should, I should.
However, I feel I must comment on your most unorthodox method of tasting.
Huh?
The accredited procedure is, of course, to partake of a small mouthful, like this, whoosh it around in the mouth like that, and then inhale like this, thus releasing the aroma...
You do it your way and I do it my way.
Châ...
Château...
Châ... teau...
Savignon!
It's very good.
♪ Who dat... who dat...
- ♪ Who dat... who dat...
- Please, sir.
- ♪ Knocking at the door?
- Please, sir. Please.
Am dat you, Sam?
- Couldn't you walk a bit more upright?
- A little upright?
- Yes.
- ♪ A little bit more upright...
♪ Who dat... who dat...
Am dat you, Sam?
Please, sir.
♪ Who dat...
Hey, why... why don't you sing with me, Sam?
- My name is not Sam.
- But sing with me!
- ♪ Who dat...
- Shh, shh, shh.
I know the way. Follow... follow me.
Here I am, young and handsome.
- Oh!
- Oh.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
A very good friend of mine.
The best friend I ever had in the whole wide world.
What was your name, friend?
Luchresi.
Fortunato Luchresi at your service, ma'am.
I am Annabel Herringbone.
I was just trying to help my friend home.
He had too much to drink!
Asseyez-vous, Sam.
No, really, I must be going.
Asseyez-vous, Sam.
Thank you.
Come on and sit down, friend.
Siddown!
- You... you live in the city, Mr. Luchresi?
- Yes. Yes, I do, Mrs. Herringbone.
My, what a lovely cat!
Well!
- You like cats?
- Oh, I adore them, yes.
I have several of my own at home.
He's... resting.
Yes, he's... resting.
Oh.
I think he's ill.
Oh.
I tell you this: With women... with women you have to assert yourself.
Take my case, for instance.
I tell my wife to give me some money.
I want to go out for the evening.
Well, sir, it used to be that she gave me trouble.
Argued with me and tried to withhold what was rightfully mine.
But now she just gives me all the money I ask for, and I can stay away the entire night doing exactly as I please - which happens to be drinking.
- Since when?
- Since when?
Huh?
Seems to me... since that day I went to that wine sellers convention and met...
And he assisted me home and I...
I introduced him to my wife.
- Good night, my treasure.
- Good night, beloved.
Let me look at you again.
Until tomorrow night, heart of my heart.
Oh!
Good evening, dear.
You gave me such a start.
- Why?
- I didn't expect you home so early.
You didn't?
I thought it would be nice if I came home early and we spent some time together.
But I see you've already gone to bed.
Oh, yes. I... I was very tired.
Exerting yourself?
Exerting?
I had a very strenuous day.
And a more strenuous evening, I assume.
I beg your pardon?
- Isn't it a little too late to beg my pardon?
- I... I don't know what you mean.
You lie! You dirty, faithless little trollop, you!
You lie!
So you know.
How long has this been going on?
Long enough for me to realise that our marriage is a farce, a mockery!
You can no longer wound me with your cruelty.
I have found, at long last, love.
How touching.
Mock me if you will, but this is the end.
You and I are finished.
I'm going to leave you and become Mrs. Fortunato Luchresi!
You are?
Congratulations.
Good afternoon, Mr. Herringbone!
- How very nice to see you again.
- And how nice to see you again!
- And how well you look.
- Thank you, sir. And yourself as well.
- Thank you. Come in.
- Thank you.
- After you, sir.
- Oh, thank you.
And how nice of you and Mrs., uh...
Mrs. Herringbone to invite me for dinner.
Oh, we're enchanted to have you, sir.
Most delighted, I assure you.
- Please.
- Thank you.
Ah, the cat!
The cat. What a charming fellow he is!
- Yes, isn't he?
- Yes. And is Mrs. Herringbone about?
Oh, yes. She's very, very busy preparing our dinner.
- May I offer you some sherry?
- Oh, I'm delighted, sir. Delighted!
- Amontillado?
- That's correct, sir.
Ah, but what an amontillado!
A wine to conjure memories of taste buds in transport.
I'm terribly happy you like it, sir.
To your health.
- And to yours, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
- A draught from paradise.
- That it is, that it is.
Let me fill your glass.
Look, mine is always empty.
- Well, I cannot resist.
- That I've noticed.
- I beg your pardon?
- No, nothing, nothing.
To your long life.
And to your long life, sir.
Right now I have a better chance than you have.
- You spoke, sir?
- No, no. Nothing.
- Let me fill up your glass.
- Well, just a bit more.
Where did you get this...- pardon me - this excellent wine?
Oh, I've had that in my cellar for a long, long time.
- Indeed?
- Saving it for a very special occasion.
- Oh, today?
- Yes, sir.
- What occasion? Surely not my presence.
- That's part of it.
And what is the other part?
Your death.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I'll give you three guesses.
- Surely you can't mean to?
- Wall you in, yes.
- But why?
- Ask your treasure, your heart of hearts.
- What?
- Ask Annabel!
Annabel? I...
Ann... a... bel?
You... you killed her.
You notice everything, don't you?
Help!
Please, let me go. Help!
Don't make so much noise. I don't like it.
- You're insane!
- That may be, but... very clever.
The way I put that drug in your amontillado with the consummate skill of a Borgia.
And this whole arrangement.
- They'll never find you behind this wall.
- You can't mean it. You can't mean it!
Haven't I convinced you of my sincerity yet?
I'm genuinely dedicated to your destruction.
Help! Help!
Help!
What kind of a man are you, anyway?
Make love to my wife and doesn't even talk to me!
It's an excellent jest, sir.
We'll have many a good laugh about it in the future.
I Will. I Will.
God...
For the love of God, Montresor...
Yes.
For the love of God.
Nice professional job.
She must have it hidden somewhere.
Eureka!
Everybody back to the counter!
Montresor is buying again!
Gentlemen, let's have a toast, huh?
To my precious wife, without whose money this most splendid evening would be impossible.
Where she is now, she won't need it anyway.
♪ Who dat knocking at the door?
Is dat you, Sam?
Argh! Argh!
Aaargh!
Give me back my head!
Keep that cat from my head, will you?!
Keep that cat from...
Give me back my head!
Aaaaargh!
Huh!
Go away!
I said... go away!
- Mr. Herringbone?
- Yes.
- We knocked, but no one answered.
- The door was ajar, so we looked in.
Then when we found the house in such a state...
In such a state?
Oh, yes. I...
I remember I was searching for something last night.
We thought there'd been some trouble, so we came right in.
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm all right!
We've received a report from a Mr. Wilkins.
He's the bartender at the Red Lion Tavern.
You know Mr. Wilkins.
Claims you spent a rather large amount of money last evening.
Well, it's my own money.
Can't I spend my own money?
Further, that you said that your wife wouldn't need the money where she is.
Might I ask, sir, where your wife is?
She's gone. She left with her lover.
I don't know where she is, nor do I care.
Are you ill, sir?
No, I... No.
You don't happen to have a little whisky on you, boys, huh?
No, sir.
You see, I've had hallucinations lately.
Been drinking a little bit too much last night.
I see. Do you mind, sir, if we search the premises?
No. Where do you want to start?
I think... the cellar.
The cellar.
Oh. Are you coming down, Montresor?
- Did you hear anything?
- No.
- No.
- I didn't think so.
Well, here we go, gentlemen.
Yes. Come on down.
I...
I think I'll drink a little less in the future.
Now he decides.
- Shut up.
- What?
Nothing, nothing.
I just keep mumbling.
I had too much to drink.
- We had better make a thorough search.
- Search?
Don't you find everything all right and in order?
Go ahead, search everything you want. I don't care.
Montresor! What a thing to say.
Naughty, naughty, Montresor.
Keep quiet!
Whoo-ooh!
Whoo-ooh!
Right behind here, Mr. Policeman.
We're right behind the wall! Right behind it.
Are you blind, Mr. Policeman?
Whoo-ooh! You're not paying attention. You're getting cold. This way.
Now are you satisfied?
What do you think?
I buried them down here?
That's exactly what he did. Exactly!
Where would I have hidden them?
Under this floor?
Or... or maybe in that wall, huh?
Look! Look how solid it is!
Look at it! Look!
What in the name of God?
- You can hear it too?
- Hear it?
What's behind there?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Well, we'll see.
What exactly is it that occurs at the moment of death?
Especially to a man who, in that moment, is not permitted to die.
As in the case of Mr. Valdemar.
There is no pain.
No...
Dairy.
You are at peace, mind and body at peace entirely.
Yes.
Then listen to the sound of my voice.
Carefully.
Pain vanished.
Mind and body in a state of peace.
You understand this, Valdemar?
I... under... stand.
Then sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
When my hand passes across your face, waken.
- Are you all right?
- Perfectly, my dear.
- The pain, it's gone?
- Vanished!
What is your finding, Doctor?
- Well, you seem to be in good condition.
- Seem to be? But I am!
Oh, come now. Admit the truth of it:
Mesmerism works! It works.
I've never doubted that it works, sir.
Only its advisability in certain cases.
It would certainly seem to be advisable in the case of Mr. Valdemar.
Or would you have me suffer untold agonies of pain in order to observe strict medical protocol?
- Ernest!
- My sweet Helene.
Forgive me, both of you, for my most untimely sense of humour.
But this is a joyous moment.
Smile!
Come. Let us drink.
Let us drink to mesmerism, the ministration of the gods.
I'm sorry, I can't drink to that.
Then drink to the health of my beautiful wife.
- To the very good health of you both.
- And to Mr. Carmichael.
Sir.
How blessed to be free of pain.
For that part, sir,
I am truly happy. Please believe me.
It's for the other aspect of mesmeric influence that I feel concerned.
- Which is, Doctor?
- Perilous toying with the human mind.
But, my dear Dr. James, what is perilous about it?
Mr. Valdemar has received nothing but advantage from its applications.
And, as we all know, he is dying of an incurable disease.
- I wish you'd stop refer...
- Helene, Helene.
The issue must be acknowledged.
Within this skull - as well you know, Doctor - there is tissue which is dying even as I speak.
I am physically doomed.
I do not say this out of bitterness or despair.
However, there is one favour I would ask:
To escape a pitiful and painful decline to death through the auspices of Mr. Carmichael.
- Would you deny him this, Doctor?
- No, sir.
And yet, you know, he will accept nothing for this blessing, save some trifling favour on my deathbed.
- Sir?
- Favour, Ernest?
I should not even have mentioned it. It's so slight.
No, please. I want to know.
Well, my dear, it's simply...
You tell them, sir. You can explain it so much better than I.
Mr. Valdemar has consented to be mesmerised in articulo mortis.
- Which is to say...
- At the point of death.
I fear it sounds more dreadful than it really is.
What does it mean?
Ernest, why?
To ascertain just how long the actual moment of death can be forestalled.
A momentous experiment.
Momentous? Monstrous would be more the word!
Sir, I appeal to you, withdraw this offer.
The deathbed is no place for lunatic experiments.
My dear young friend, what can it matter whether I die 10 or 20 minutes beyond that point when I shall die at any rate?
What could be less important?
I owe this gentleman a great deal.
A great deal.
I could not dream of refusing him such an insignificant request.
As you say, sir.
- I fear I must leave now.
- So soon? I am sorry.
Good night, Doctor.
Thank you for attending me.
My dear, show our friend to the door, will you?
Yes, of course.
A bit more wine, Mr. Carmichael? Hm?
Oh! Thank you.
Elliot, this experiment...
Do everything in your power to dissuade him from it, Helene.
I've no proof that it's dangerous, no proof whatever. I only sense that it might be.
What is it, Elliot? Why is it that since that man entered our life
I can't think, I'm uncertain...
Oh, he helps Ernest.
I can't argue with that.
He seems to relieve him of all pain. To see him suffer is more than I can stand.
- But at the same time...
- You distrust Carmichael?
Yes, I do.
Still, it's true that he asks for nothing.
Perhaps he asks for nothing because he desires everything - including you.
You can't be serious.
- You haven't seen him looking at you?
- Yes, but...
Of course I've no right to say this, really, for I too look at you.
Elliot, please.
You know how I feel.
I love my husband and respect him.
- No more than I do.
- I know that.
So let us think of nothing else but Ernest and our respect for him.
- Good night, Helene.
- Good night.
Ernest.
Hm? Oh. Yes, my dear?
Won't you reconsider?
- Regarding the experiment?
- I fear him.
Fear Carmichael? But, my dear, think of the pain he has spared me.
If only you could see the change in him when you're under his control, Ernest.
All the fawning ceases. He no longer calls you Mr. Valdemar. It's just Valdemar.
- He tells you what to do, what to think.
- Please, my dear. No more.
Let us forget it.
It is established and of no importance.
What is important is you.
I wish with all my heart that following my death you would marry our good Dr. James.
No, no, no. Please, my dear. Let me finish.
I know that there is a bond between you.
All honourable. I know that too, and I love you both for it.
But I... I am going to die soon, Helene, and it would make me very happy to know that you would not be alone, that you would marry again.
Oh, my dear. Your happiness means more to me than anything.
Anything!
But I refuse to die until that happiness has been assured.
It... it approaches, does it not?
No pretence, please.
It approaches.
No, my dear. No sorrow. I...
I am content, believe me.
Have you informed Mr. Carmichael, as I requested?
- He is below, sir.
- Then fetch him, if you will.
Quickly. Go quickly.
Have a care, sir.
So... the time has come, Mr. Carmichael.
It will be to you, sir, I promise, no more than sinking into a dreamless sleep.
Best hurry, Mr. Carmichael.
Now, no despair, I implore you.
It is peace I go to.
Freedom from this ghastly pain.
Your hand, Doctor.
I charge you this... upon your soul:
Watch over my Helene.
- Swear to it?
- I swear to it. Rest easily, sir.
I do now.
With all my heart I thank you... for having added to my life one great, sweet measure of devotion.
No...
You may proceed, Mr. Carmichael.
Look at the turning wheel, at the changing of the colours, and sleep.
Deep... deep sleep.
Your body losing all sensation.
Your mind enveloped in darkness.
Nothing can disturb you now as you drift ever deeper into darkness... and sleep.
Sleep...
Sleep...
Valdemar.
Do you hear me? It is my voice.
I... hear.
Are you asleep?
I... am... asleep.
Valdemar, raise your right arm.
Lower it.
Is there any pain?
No... pain.
I am... dying-
Oh!
Please... do not wake me.
Let me... die.
I will not wake you, Valdemar.
Deep... deep sleep... from which there is no waking... unless I say.
- You understand, Valdemar?
- I... understand.
You may examine him now if you wish.
Do you so fear me?
I have but released your husband from his pain once more.
- Would you have had me do otherwise?
- No.
- Then do I... personally offend you?
- Please, Mr. Carmichael, not now.
Valdemar, return to your sleep.
Return to your sleep, Valdemar!
- I command you!
- Stop it!
Valdemar.
Do you hear me?
Do you hear the sound of my voice?
Are you asleep now?
I... have been... asleep.
But now... I am... dead.
You are asleep, Valdemar.
No.
Yes, yes, yes. You do but sleep.
Raise your right arm.
Raise it, Valdemar!
I command you! Raise your right arm!
He does not. He does not.
He is dead.
Yes, he is dead.
But still aware.
- Release him.
- Release him?!
Valdemar, do you hear me?
I hear.
Tell me, where are you?
Darkness.
- Stop it!
- That will do, Mr. Carmichael.
Where, Valdemar? Where?
Stop it!
- End the control, Mr. Carmichael!
- No!
Valdemar, tell me what you see.
- Your surroundings, what are they?
- That will do!
Are you insane?! Do you not comprehend the import of what has happened?
His body is dead, but his mind lives on, controlled by me!
- Which control will now end! Let him die!
- No!
Be gone!
Where am I?
What place is this?
I see only darkness.
People.
Multitudes of people.
No...
No-o-o-o!
No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!
Valdemar, be still.
Help me.
Be still, Valdemar.
I will let you go when I am finished.
Your whisky, sir.
Leave it there.
Get out!
Valdemar.
Valdemar, do you hear me?
Be still.
Be still!
Release me.
Release me.
Give me peace.
Be still!
Release me.
Let me go.
I will release you when I am ready.
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Good evening.
- Is Mr. Carmichael upstairs?
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Come. I promise you an end to it, Helene.
HOW?
Come.
Now, tell me this.
Come in.
- What can I do for you?
- I'm here to order you, Mr. Carmichael...
Not request, but order. You will end the mesmeric control immediately.
- Will I, Doctor?
- You will.
And how do you propose to enforce that order?
With this.
- You wouldn't dare.
- Do you choose to take that risk?
If you kill me, Valdemar will remain in the same state indefinitely.
- Perhaps for ever.
- No!
- I shall count to three, then I shall kill you.
- Elliot!
- You must be out of your mind.
- One.
- No.
- Two.
- Elliot, no!
- Wait a minute.
- I want you to hear something first.
- Nothing from you, sir.
Did I say it was from me?
If you will, come with me.
Valdemar.
Tell them what you told me just now, about Helene.
I do not wish for her to marry Dr. James.
I wish for her to marry Mr. Carmichael.
- No!
- You heard him, madam.
- You control him. His words are yours!
- That is a lie!
- Is it?
- Yes!
Elliot, please, you must leave now.
- What?
- I want you to go.
- But that was not your husband speaking!
- It was his voice.
- But not his will!
- I don't know that.
- Helene, in the name of God!
- Elliot, please go.
There's nothing more to be said or done.
I just want you to go now.
Very well. But I shall be back.
And God help you if you do her harm in any way.
- Well, madam?
- I believe Dr. James is quite correct.
It is not my husband who would have me marry you.
- You heard him with your own ears.
- It was not him.
However, I will make a bargain with you, Mr. Carmichael.
I'll marry you... upon the stipulation that you set my husband free.
I need make no bargains with you, madam.
- What?
- You will marry me in any case.
No. Not unless you end his torment.
Edicts, madam? Orders from you?
Allow me to enlighten you.
I am in command here.
You will do as I say, or I will leave Mr. Valdemar exactly as he is and never, do you understand me, madam?, Never let him go.
I've coveted you these many months, hungered for you.
And now you shall be my wife.
I shall take what I desire.
- Your body and your soul, if I demand it!
- I've heard enough!
No! Stop it! Let me go!
Let me go! You're hurting me!
Help! Help me!
Let me go! Help! Help me!
No!
Argh!
Helene! Helene!
Ugh!
Come on, give me a little...
Aww go away.
You shouldn't have done that!
I told you to keep your filthy hands off me.
If it wasn't for your sister, Carmelita,
I never would come around this dump.
You couldn't buy enough booze to make me go for you.
Why don't you try some of those sideshow freaks?
You dirty, filthy pig!
So, I belong with the freaks, huh?
I'll fix you so even the freaks will not look at you! Ortega!
Take him and make him like my other little pet!
You pig, I'll make you look like... [inaudible]
Ortega, look at him!
- What's wrong?
- That cat, get him out of here!
Alright, but why get all shook up about a cat?
I can't stand them!
Every time I get near one something strange happens to me.
Why don't you lay off that stuff?
Why don't you lay off the father routine?
Look, honey, I'm just trying to give you a friendly bit of advice.
Those mistakes in your routine last night almost cost you your job!
Okay... I'll give it a try. Just for you.
Look, I'd rather you did this just for yourself.
Maybe so... maybe not.
I think it's about time you left,
Harold. What do you think?
I dunno, Jerry. What do you think?
Well, if we're late, Angie's just liable to blow her top.
Yeah, and her mother wouldn't like that, would she?
Her mother doesn't like anything...
...especially me.
Well, if you get a job or something she might change her mind, ya know?
A job?
Be a little discreet about that, Harold.
Somebody's liable to hear you.
You gotta do something, ya know?
The world's here to be enjoyed... not to make you depressed.
That's what work does, Harold, it makes you feel... depressed.
So, instead of being in that state of depression, why don't we cut out, okay?
Swingin'.
No...
No, I'm sorry, Phil, I can't.
No, I made other plans for the day.
Uh huh.
Okay...
Bye bye.
Who was that?
Oh, Phil. He wanted me to go to the beach with him today.
Well, why don't you go?
Um, I can't. I have a date with Jerry.
I don't see how you can prefer Jerry to Phil, when Phil is such a nice boy.
I like Jerry. Phil just isn't my type!
You're fascinated by Jerry because he's different.
He isn't like any of the boys you know.
Oh, Mother. Jerry is fun, exciting.
We go places I never dreamed of before!
You're right at the age where you could make a terrible mistake.
And you think Jerry would be a mistake?
- Yes I do.
Jerry has no education. He'll never be able to make a living. - Oh, Mother.
If you try to build a life with him, you'll be miserable.
Really, Mother. You're way ahead of me.
I just have fun with Jerry, that's all!
Does he always have to honk that horn and drive like a maniac?
All the boys do, Mother.
That's the way they are.
Hey, are things that bad, you gotta wash your own car?
Things are rough all over.
Yeah, the world's in a state of depression.
Angie, please don't go.
But I like Jerry so much.
Some day he's going to meet a girl that is just his type.
- And you'll be hurt.
- I don't think so.
He didn't even come to the door for you!
It wouldn't be Jerry if he did.
Angie, baby!
How's college?
Fine. You should try it sometime.
No, thanks! The world's my college.
Let's go! See you later, Madison.
Get your tickets here! Get your tickets!
Get your tickets! Get your tickets here!
Hey, Harold! Let's go! Come on!
Oh, Harold! Don't do that!
My first night on the floor was a real spectacle.
That's the last time I'll drink before a performance.
The manager wanted to fire me but he's a friend. I talked him out of it.
But my wife did say... now she's really something...
If I didn't stop drinking, she was gonna leave me.
Boy, I'm sure gonna miss her.
But ya know, with my wife, there are two sides to every argument...
My wife's and her mother's.
But they're really wonderful.
Miss Marge Neilson and Mr Bill Ward.
Let's have a big round of applause.
Hey, Marge, are you alright?
Just leave me alone, will you?
Okay, okay!
Look, I warned you last night to lay off that stuff!
I know. I'm sorry.
I can't run a nightclub with a drunken star. Now you take the next show off...
And if you're not back in time for the third show, and sober, you're fired!
Here you are, folks, the biggest bargain to hit the midway.
They'll thrill you, they'll kill you.
You'll even ask for more!
20 beautiful girls, supple as a serpent, twisting, writhing and winding.
The most spectacular show ever to hit the midway.
The Garden of Eden, folks, and none of the trees have leaves.
Adam and Eve never had it so good...
[inaudible]
...see everything for only 50 cents!
The biggest bargain to hit the midway!
It's not on film, folks.
It's a living, breathing, vibrating show right here on our stage!
You say that isn't enough?
You say you want more?
Alright, after the show, we raffle off one of the girls.
So you may be the lucky one. Yours will be the pleasure of a private show!
Welcome, my dear! Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
You wish to have your fortune told?
Yes, please.
It is a thing one must be sure about.
But it is a grave responsibility to learn one's future.
I'm willing to take the chance.
From the expression on your face, it would seem to me you are searching for something.
I'm not sure what it is. I only know something evil lies ahead for me.
Do you feel that your life might be in danger?
I only know that something will happen. I have to know what.
Then we must consult the cards.
The cards will tell us if we are in danger.
What did you see?
I'll look for myself.
- That's the death card, isn't it?
- Yes.
I knew it. I knew it!
No! Not that way!
Never mind, folks. Just one of the many attractions we have going at all times.
What's wrong with her?
Well, whatever she's running from must be in there.
Come on. Let's go in there and get spooked, okay?
Yeah, Jerry. Come on.
Let's get our fortunes told.
I can find a lot better ways to spend my money. - Come on!
Don't tell me your feet are starting to freeze.
Oh, I'll try anything once.
Ugh. It's dark in here.
Look, Jerry. A crystal ball.
- How about that. Let's have a seat, huh?
You wish your fortunes told? - What do you think we came here for, to eat?
I'd like my fortune read.
Cards my palm will deal her.
- Okay, how much?
- Fifty cents.
Thank you. Give me your palm please.
You are a very fortunate young lady.
You are going to be lucky in love.
I see only one husband for you.
This is a remarkable [inaudible].
You are going to be rich, if you are not already so.
I see that your mother will not approve of the man you pick for a husband.
Okay, when are you gonna use the fishbowl?
I use both the crystal and the palm for my readings.
The crystal shows the immediate future.
The palm shows the indication of one's entire life.
The use of the crystal is very dangerous.
Why do you say that?
Sometimes, the crystal sees things it is better we do not know.
What is this?
What do you see? - I see much unhappiness for you in the near future.
Someone near to you is going to die. - Oh come on, now.
The crystal does not lie!
What the crystal sees...
It reveals.
I see... someone...
Yes...! It is you!
By water... Now...
I see a man...
I can no longer see you...
Now the man moves...
Yes... you are now on the ground...
By water...
I can no longer see anything else.
Well, now that you read her fortune, why don't you tell me mine?
There is nothing I can tell you!
- Why can't you read mine?
There are some who cannot be read. Their life is but a shadow in the crystal.
You are such a person.
Come on, now. Tell me mine, will ya?
I cannot tell you anything else now!
I think you clouded up her crystal ball.
Clouds affect only the cloudy.
Never the image.
Why don't you come back some other time, Jerry?
Sure, I'll come back again.
You can bet on that.
I will charge you only for the young lady. - You bet you will.
Which is the way out of here?
That way.
Come on.
Boy. I don't wanna get lost in this place.
Alright, folks. Step up and see our show. We have girls, girls and girls!
Now that you've had your fortune told... what do you say we go over there, go inside and look at the girls, huh?
I'd rather not, Jerry.
Let's go to the funhouse instead.
Come on, Angel. Let's just stick around a little while, huh?
- Yeah, that's a good idea, Angie.
- Alright. Just for a few minutes.
Ortega!
Tell my sister, Carmelita, that the time is coming!
Stella, step forward and give the folks a little sample.
That's it. Take it easy.
We have twenty beautiful girls and only ten beautiful costumes.
I wanna give you a glimpse of our star, that exotic gypsy dancer, Carmelita!
This is Carmelita. The one and only.
Just look at those dark, dreamy eyes, those lips and that body. What a body!
It's covered out here but on the inside you will see that body au naturel.
Doing her original, exotic dance as only she can do it. Don't miss her!
Come inside and see the one and only woman of mystery.
That's just a glimpse of our big attraction we have on inside.
We have twenty beautiful big acts in one continuous show.
Now, step right up, get your tickets and enjoy yourself!
Come on, Jerry. Let's go.
You know, I think I'd like to go inside and see the show, Angel.
Well, I don't!
I thought we agreed that what I say, goes!
It's not that, Jerry. I didn't like how you were staring at that Carmelita.
Come on. Let's go inside.
It'll be fun. - No!
"No"? What do you mean, "No"?
- If you go in, you go in without me!
What are you trying to do? Force me to choose between you and that girly show?
It's not the show you're interested in. It's that stripper!
Look, I'm going to go in there with or without you. So, make up your mind!
Okay! Go without me!
You're gonna let her go?
I don't like anyone tellin' me what I have to do.
Harold, why don't you be a buddy, take the car and see that she gets home okay?
- She'll cool off tomorrow.
- Okay, Jerry. That suits me fine.
See you later!
Hey, Stella!
How about a date tomorrow night?
- Okay. Should be fun.
How does 7 o'clock sound?
- Great! Where are we going?
Oh, I thought we could spend a quiet, little evening at your place.
I could bring up a couple of steaks and you could broil 'em.
That's your idea of a big evening?
I should slave over a hot stove cooking dinner for you?
Why not?
Who is going to wash the dishes?
- Oh, I'll wash the dishes.
It only hurts when I kiss...
Kiss someone new.
Someone that's not you.
It hurts when I embrace his smile
Because I know all the while
It's not you.
I was pretending
That our ending was just one of those things.
Now I'm laughing through all the tears that losing you brings.
It only hurts
When I touch... touch someone new.
Someone that's not you.
It hurts because the touch is cold
Until the one I hold is you.
The pain gets worse and it just plain hurts.
Now we'll give you our exotic, beautiful gypsy dancer, Carmelita!
Take it off!
Hey, is Carmelita here?
- What are you doing here?
- Get out!
- The nerve of some people!
- It's a peep show he wants.
He thought he could probably get some real, fast action before the show!
Carmelita?
I am here.
Your note said you wanted to see me.
Yes... follow me.
Jerry
You feel yourself slipping into a deeper sleep.
It is as if you were in your own bed.
Surrounded by warm covers.
Nothing will bother you.
Nothing will waken you.
You will hear only my voice.
See only that which
I choose to show you.
Open your eyes, Jerry.
Look at the wheel!
Look at the beautiful, spinning wheel.
See how it spins?
See how the light travels from the wheel... to the center... to the edges... and back again...
It is a deep, spinning hole...
You feel yourself falling...
Falling into that hole...
Deeper... deeper...
Deeper into the spinning hole...
You will hear my command... and obey!
When you awake you will have no memory, no knowledge of the fact you were here.
You will do only that which
I have commanded you to do!
I don't have to do this for a living.
My father and mother have an iron and steel company.
You've heard it before?
My mother irons and my father steals.
And now The Hungry Mouth... takes great pride and pleasure in introducing a young, new singer.
Let's have a big hand for Mr Don Snyder!
How do I stand with your heart?
Tell me, please, so I can know
I'm walking blind through this wonderland
Just because I love you so
I have to know how you feel
I can't living like this
My heart's aflame and I can't really tell
The meaning in your tender kiss
Tell me, darling
Speak straight from your heart
If you love me
A beautiful romance will start
What's wrong, Marge? That fight you had with the manager still getting you down?
It's not that.
It's something that happened on the midway tonight. - What do you mean?
Tell me, my darling, how you really feel
We're on. I'll tell you after the show.
How do I stand with your heart?
Thank you very much.
And now we take pride in presenting our main attraction
The very talented
Miss Marge Neilson and Mr Bill Ward
Let's have a big round of applause
Obey! You must obey!
You must do as Madame Estrella says!
- Obey!
Kill!
- You must kill!
Kill!
- You must obey!
Kill!
Jerry!
Jerry
Over here, Jerry! Over here!
I can help you, Jerry.
Only I can help you.
[inaudible]...no!
Help! Help!
Hey! It's about time you got up.
Boy, I had a restless night last night.
I know. I heard you talking to yourself last night while you were sleeping.
It was just about the craziest dream I've ever had.
It must have been about that crazy chick, Carmelita, huh?
Come on, Jerry. Tell me, what happened last night.
I don't know.
I just can't seem to quite figure out exactly what did happen.
I don't even remember coming home last night.
Sometimes, when I get a load on, I can't remember things like that either.
I wasn't drinking.
- Oh, sure. Sure.
Say, how about you and Angela.
Everything okay?
She made me take her right home.
Here's your keys.
Thanks. Was she mad?
Not as mad as her mother.
Who cares about her mother.
I kind of like her myself.
Maybe so. Look, I gotta go.
- I'll go with you.
I wouldn't be able to get this piece of junk running anyhow.
No, you stay here.
Don't leave town...
Say, Madison. Where's Angie?
- She's over there by the pool.
- Thanks.
So, you finally decided to drop by?
Angie, I'd like to explain about last night.
It's okay. I understand.
I can tell by your voice, you're still mad at me.
Why shouldn't I be after the way you acted? - You know...?
I'm a little confused about that too.
I can't understand what you saw in her.
Look. Can't we change the subject?
- Alright.
But I sure would like to know what happened after I left.
We interrupt this program to bring you a special announcement.
Police are still searching for the bizarre murderer of Marge Nielson...
Exotic dancer at
The Hungry Mouth nightclub.
Miss Neilson was stabbed to death last night during a performance of her act.
Her partner, Bill Ward, was fatally wounded while trying to apprehend the murderer.
Police have no description of the killer
But they are, at present, checking all transients in the area.
Stay tuned to this station for further developments.
We now return you to our musical program.
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Step right up!
Join the show! One thin dime, one thin tenth of a dollar... will get you in to see some of the most exotic looking ladies on the midway!
This time it's Miss Carole Kay and the girls of the midway...
joining forces to bring you song and dance "Shook Outta Shape"...
When I come home and it's after twelve
Momma's waitin' up to give me welts
She gets a-shook outta shape she gets a-shook outta shape
She slipped a disc when she does the twist
She gets a-shook outta shape
Then she says little girl
"Where you been?"
"You shoulda been home about half past ten"
She gets a-shook outta shape she gets a-shook outta shape
She slipped a disc when she does the twist
She gets a-shook outta shape
Her feet start to tremble and she shakes her fist
Oh Momma's windin' up to do the twist
The room starts to quiver and the house starts to shake
Momma's done twisted up an earthquake!
She says "Little girl
You may as well know"
"You'll do as I say or you'll Go go go!"
She gets a-shook outta shape she gets a-shook outta shape
She slips a disc when she does the twist
She gets a-shook outta shape
Her feet start to tremble and she shakes her fist
Oh Momma's windin' up to do the twist
The room starts to quiver and the house starts to shake
Momma's done twisted up an earthquake!
She says "Little girl
You may as well know"
"You'll do as I say or you'll Go go go!"
She gets a-shook outta shape she gets a-shook outta shape
She slips a disc when she does the twist
She gets a-shook outta shape
She slips a disc when she does the twist
She gets a-shook outta shape
Yoohoo!
Hello?
If you're looking for my sister,
Carmelita, she's not here.
I wasn't looking for Carmelita.
I was looking for you.
Why?
- Have you seen this?
What about it?
She was in your tent last night!
- Was she? I don't remember.
I wouldn't have remembered either.
If it wasn't for the way she looked when she left.
She seemed terrified!
Did she?
- Yes...
Something happens, it happens.
Here today, gone tomorrow.
Just out of curiosity, what did you predict the future held for her?
Nothing... because she wasn't here last night!
If I didn't know you better, I'd almost say you had something to hide.
Well, I've got to get home.
I've got a date.
And now we give you the girl with the golden voice, Miss Kerry Randall!
Choo choo ch'bootchie
I love you baby yes I do
Choo choo ch'bootchie
I need you baby the whole night through
Choo choo ch'bootchie your lips are as sweet as cherry wine
Choo choo ch'bootchie
I gotta have you baby all the time
Choo choo

Choo ch'bootchie kisses drive me wild, drive me wild
Choo choo

Wha wha wha!
Choo choo ch'bootchie you [?] me with the slightest touch
Choo choo ch'bootchie
I love-a you baby oh so much
Jerry? What are you doing here?
- I've come for a few answers.
I'm not sure what happened last night behind these curtains.
But I think you know.
- Do I?
It's like I've been having a nightmare!
After this afternoon with Angela,
I'm beginning to believe it.
Have you been drinking?
- No, I haven't been drinking.
Everything's been kinda mixed up but...
After hearing that news broadcast a while ago...
I'm beginning to think things are a little different.
Try new things.
Last night I killed a girl and I think you know why!
So, tell me. What happened last night behind those curtains?
If you really must know what happened behind those curtains... why don't you go behind them?
- I think I will.
Come on in, Harold.
I got here as soon as I could. I had to ride the bus. My car wouldn't start!
Harold, we've just got to find him and help him!
I still think you should call the police instead of trying to find him yourself.
But he's my roommate! I know the guy!
I know he's not like that!
Would you please give us a chance?
Don't call the police, okay?
You're right, Mother, but let's wait awhile.
Harold, on the phone you said he was upset. Upset about what?
I thought he was upset about last night.
I didn't realize he was on the verge of going psycho!
He acted as if he was going out of his mind. Sort of dazed...
If he's in a daze, wandering around the streets, then we've got to get to him before the police pick him up!
Do you have any idea where he might have gone?
Do you think he could have gone back to that carnival and that girl Carmelita?
That sounds like something he'd do.
We've got to get to him before the police pick him up!
Please give us a chance.
Alright, Angela. You can go.
As long as Madison goes with you.
But if you're not back in the next two hours, I'm calling the police!
Okay, then! Let's go!
Stella. Stella!
Stella?
Welcome, my little pet.
You have done so very well.
This time, I think you ought to get your reward.
Ortega! Bring me the acid!
It is too bad that remembered so much!
Now you have left me very little choice!
Take him back and put him with the rest of the little pets!
One more!
Ortega! Ortega, I...!
Estrella?
Come on! Let's get through!
My balloon!
Look!
Jerry!
Come back! Please, come back!
Wait, please, Jerry! Don't!
Come back, Jerry!
Come back!
- Jerry!
He's here! Don't!
Jerry, please!
What's the matter with you?
Stop!
Stop, Jerry!
Oh, no!
No, Jerry! Please, no!
Please, stay!
Stay for me, Jerry!
Go back! Angie, go back!
Go back! Get away!
Go back!
Go back!
No!
Jerry!
What is life?
It is the beginning of death.
What is death?
It is the end of life.
What is existence?
It is the continuity of blood.
What is blood?
It is the reason to exist!
AT MIDNIGHT I'LL TAKE YOUR SOUL
I wish you a terrible evening, my brave little friends.
Remember these words:
Those of you who have been watching a funeral, and seen the pale face of a corpse.
Those of you who don't believe in wandering ghosts when you leave this theatre... and have to walk in the dark streets... alone...
There is still time.
Don't watch this movie!
Go home!
Too late.
You've not believed.
You want to show a courage that doesn't exist?
Then, stay!
Suffer!
Watch...
"At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul!"
Oh, Carlos, why did you leave me? Why?
Be brave, Mrs. Joana.
My condolences, Mrs. Joana.
You can be sure that I provided the best of my services.
Excuse me...
Bring my lunch, Lenita.
Coming, Zé.
That funeral made me hungry...
I'm thinking of doubling my fee to follow the burial.
I'm sick and tired of all that crying.
It's your job, Zé. You should take care of your clients.
Look, I'm tired of all these people
Hey, where's the meat?
Not today. Did you forget that today is Holy Friday?
What do I care if it's Holy or Evil Friday?
I'll get what I want and no religious fanatic will stop me.
I'll eat meat today, even if it's human flesh!
Watch out, Zé!
The devil may be tempting you!
If I meet him,
I'll invite him for dinner.
Oh, what a pleasant surprise!
What do you want?
Terezinha insisted on visiting
Lenita and invite her to the procession.
I think it is no use... But...
I will talk to her.
As you wish.
- Where are you going, Zé?
Well... I want to buy a lamb.
Save for Easter?
No, to eat today!
I'll go downstairs a little, Lenita.
I know who you saw!
It's that little woman.
You think I didn't notice the way you looked at her this afternoon?
You know that I hate melodramatics!
I'm not a woman to be treated this way, Zé!
And stop bothering that girl.
At least have some respect to your friendship with Antônio.
You have talked enough.
Antônio will be there soon.
I don't want to stay there too long.
Good evening.
Good evening.
- Good evening
Where are you going?
I'm taking Terezinha to Clemencia and Antônio will pick her up later.
What a coincidence!
I'm going there too.
Don't worry. I'll take her.
Antônio may not like that, Sr. Zé.
Well... Antônio is my best friend, right?
So it seems.
You decide, Terezinha.
Well, if you have another appointment...
Ah, but he does.
Don't you, Aristides?
You have a very important appointment.
Isn't truth?
Yes. Now I remembered.
I do have an appointment, yes.
I'll appreciate if you could take her.
Good night, Terezinha.
Good night.
- Good night.
Thanks for allowing me to walk with you.
I don't see a reason to thank me.
Will Antônio take long to pick you up?
Not, he said that he would come soon.
Lucky man.
You know that I suffer with
Antônio's luck having you as his fiancée?
I think you're exaggerating.
I think I'm a happy woman for having the love of Antônio.
Eitheryou are silly, or want to play with me.
You know you aren't the woman forAntônio.
You are the woman for me!
Take your hands off me, Zé!
You're hurting me!
I want to see if your lips are so defiant as your words!
You have the fangs of a snake... and the face of an angel.
Antônio wouldn't know about this.
But I ask you for not let thisscene happen again
Very well, I'll go with you.
Thanks.
I'd rather go alone.
Bring some wine, Maria.
Ranulfo.
Yes, Mr. Zé!
Go to my house and ask Lenita to send me the lamb.
I'll be back soon.
It looks like a good game.
Very good.
There's room for one more?
Thanks! You're very kind.
Maria, more wine.
That man scares me, Mr. Francisco!
Don't let him see it, or things gonna be worse.
I pass.
I double.
The bet are too high for me, too.
Looks like... just you and me.
Will you go on?
I double.
Brave man.
A real man got to be like this:
All... or nothing.
I pay a thousand to see your cards.
But, I-I... d-don't have any more money.
No? Then show me your cards.
It's... three kings.
Bad luck, my friend.
- Four aces.
- It is not possible!
Let go of the money, man!
I can't. I need the money!
Let go of the money!
My hand, my hand...
As I said: I like brave men!
Call the doctor.
I'll pay for the bill.
To.
Ah, you're my witnesses:
It was an accident.
Here's the meat, Mr. Zé.
Excellent, just in time.
Ascene like that can make everyone hunger, right?
You, Bonifácio. You look hungry.
Have a piece of this lamb.
No, thanks, I don't want it.
Come here, boy!
Have a bite... It's very good.
- Today is a holy day, Mr. Zé.
I can't eat meat. - Eat it!
Please...
Eat it!
Ah, the doctor is here!
What's happening here?
An unfortunate accident, doctor.
The victim is Zerequiel.
Take good care of him and I'll pay all the bills.
Your kindness knows no bounds, Zé.
Thank you.
More wine, Maria!
Better take him to the hospital.
Very well.
You act as if you're afraid of me.
No, Mr. Zé.
I have othercustomers to take care.
Leave them to Chico, heh?
Tonight you work only for me, what do you think?
What does he want with my niece?
Is no one here brave enough to face this man?
- Then why don't you?
- That's what I'll do!
Zé, leave the girl alone!
And who's going to make me leave her?
I am, you emissary ofSatan!
Stop, Zé, stop!
You're going to kill the poor man!
Have mercy, Zé! Mercy...
I have enough work with those who die of natural causes.
You can be sure:
I'll charge double to bury anyone I kill!
- Let's go home, Zé.
- Let's go.
Oh, I'm going to the crossroads by the graveyard...
Anyone wants to follow me?
I was passing by with Terezinha when I heard the screams.
What happened, Antônio?
- It's all right now.
- Thank goodness.
By the way, Antônio, let's take a raincheck on that fishing.
It's up to you.
I'm going to take Terezinha home.
Want to come along?
But, Antônio, he has to go home.
Lenita is all alone.
Awoman who can't bear a child needs no care.
We'll talk tomorrow, Antônio.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Terezinha rejects me because the existence of Lenita.
Is life worth living if there's no son to continue the bloodline?
What's one mistress among so many women?
Lenita has to die...
Lenita has to die...
I'm so sorry about what happened.
Will you forgive me?
Tell me you aren't angry with me...
It's all right, Lenita.
You make me so happy!
I can't help but feeljealous.
I want to make you happy, my love!
Your wish will be fulfilled.
You're going to make me very happy.
This will be a very amusing show!
Awoman must belong to only one man.
Since you're of no use to me,
I'll do you a favor and spare you of the sin of needing another man.
Is your life worth living if you can't bear a child... to continue your bloodline?
You wouldn't be an obstacle to the only truth of the existence.
Terezinha will be mine... and from her womb my lineage will continue.
I'll have the honor of seeing you die before my eyes.
Pity... You seemed so unique
Now there you are, in the painful affliction of death!
You suffer, because you can't scream!
Lenita, now you leave me and become the death's mistress.
It was a great show! Thank you!
Let's make sure the doctor takes good care of you.
There's nothing more to do.
She was bitten by a spider.
Poor girl. It must have been so painful.
I'll file the report for the police officer.
Very well, doctor.
I'll take care of the rest.
Well, goodbye.
I want to go home, I want to go home...
- Be quiet, boy, or I'll beat you!
Quiet!
- Ah, you...
- I want to go...
Don't abuse your child!
He's the continuity of your blood.
A real man doesn't cry.
Take your son... but don't hurt him.
It's been fifteen days since Lenita died.
I miss hervery much.
Of course you do.
Lenita loved you very much, and I know that you loved her too.
Yes. One day everything comes to an end.
We are born... and then die.
That's life.
We have got to accept that.
Ah... What ifwe go fishing tomorrow?
Okay.
Oh, Zé, one more thing.
- What?
- Do you want to visit the gypsy with us?
Do what?
Terezinha insisted.
She wants to know her future.
You know, women about to get married...
- And you, do you want to go?
- Well, we always have some doubt, right?
I'll go.
It'll be fun to see two superstitious under the spell of a witch.
- Good evening!
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Come in, my children!
Make yourselves at home.
Have a seat.
- I'd like to know...
- Say no more!
Look into my eyes, and I'll tell you your future.
Beware, my child! Beware
Happiness is yours.
But don't forget who you love, and everything will be right.
Otherwise there will be death... misfortune...
Read my future now.
Who knows, it may be a little better
Your lifeline ends right here!
Don't think of your earthly life, and everything will go well.
Fulfill your soul.
Don't allow the earth to receive your body in broad daylight.
Your salvation demands that you be buried at midnight!
Stop that nonsense, you old witch!
Forgive me, but I can't stand this foolishness.
In your eyes I see your fate.
You'll pay for your sins, and when the time comes, you'll suffer the horrors of hell!
You go to hell!
Let's go home, Terezinha.
How much?
You don't have to pay me.
The laws of the supernatural forbid me to accept money when death is foretold.
Go, my children. Beware.
Well, Terezinha, let's forget that gypsy woman and think about what to do tomorrow.
I know. The hard work will be all mine.
You'll have a good night's sleep, and want me to wake you up, right?
So, it's all set? Let's go, Antônio.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.
Good night.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I feel restless.
A good bath will cure that.
- Come over, and have a drink with me.
- Very well.
Try this wine, Zé.
I think you'll like it.
Drinking is the best way to ward off the evil spirits.
As if you believed in such things...
If I believe it or not, in fact
I must agree with the believers.
Frankly, I don't understand you, Zé.
Where does all your disbelief came from?
It's like a rebellion. Against what?
You have a lot to learn, Antônio.
I can't disbelieve, when I never had any belief.
To believe in what? In a symbol?
In an non-existent force created by ignorance?
Yes, I'm a rebel... against fools like you, who fear what you don't see, and become slaves to that which really exists: Life!!
I don't know why I should fear life.
Because it's life that makes your flesh throb.
Life feeds your feelings, and if you aren't strong... not to fight it, you'll be dominated, and will suffer.
Take a look at your people
Why do they fear me?
Because I use black clothes?
Because I believe in myself?
Because I laugh at their beliefs?
No. Because I'm stronger than then, and I have brain... enough to dominate whoever that it is.
They're weak, because they're enslaved by what they don't know.
I'm free.
Therefore, I'm stronger.
You may have your reasons, but I'm happy the way I am.
I love Terezinha and I know she loves me.
I don't have any innerconflict.
I want only to marry her, and I know that will happen soon.
We like the same things.
I feel good believing in God.
I can't be a rebel against everyone.
You know, Terezinha is like an angel.
We're going to remodel this house... and live here together for the rest of our lives.
That is my biggest desire.
What was all that faith good for?
I'm stronger than you!
Antônio! Antônio!
Antônio? Antô...
I don't know, Barretos.
It was quite a shock to me.
Believe me, I would give my own life for Antônio's.
Don't think that I'm accusing you.
But you were the last person to see him alive, so you must remain a suspect until we have an autopsy
Excuse me...
Commissioner, the doctor needs you.
Excuse me.
I must go to the morgue.
I'm going to my funerary, and later I'll meet you there.
Very well.
"In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit".
Antônio! Antônio!
Antônio!
Murderer!
Damn you! Murderer!
Calm down... Take her outside.
You killed Antônio! Murderer!
Try to calm her down.
Close the casket.
So soon we won't forget
Antônio's funeral.
They say he was buried at midnight to save his soul.
He must have something wrong with him, because he was Zé's friend.
We should run that man out of town!
He's got an eye forTerezinha...
And the girl is at home all alone.
Her father went to the city to see his wife at the hospital.
Look who's here.
Maria, bring me a bottle ofwine.
Hey, did you change your name to Maria?
Leave the bottle there; put there, old man! Leave it!
I asked her to serve me.
I'm waiting, girl.
Come here.
How much for the bird?
But, it's not for sale.
What's the price?
Well, I don't know. I don't know.
Is two thousand enough?
Great... great!
I'll take the bird.
We'll talk some other day.
What now?
You never seen a little bird?
Or shall I take the measurements for your coffins?
Oh, what do you want here so late?
Don't be afraid. I brought you a present.
Thank you. Good night.
Hold on, girl. Show some manners.
Please, Zé. What will the neighbors think?
Don't worry.
They will not think anything.
This people don't have the guts to go out in the streets at this hour.
What are you going to do with the bird?
Throw it away.
You don't want to accept my present.
Oh, no! Poor thing!
He must be hungry, poor one.
I knew you had a kind heart.
Please, you're hurting me!
- You...
- Have mercy...
- You wouldn't treat Antônio like that.
- Go away!
Don't talk about Antônio. Go away!
After all I did to rid you of that fool, you tell me to go away?
Don't touch me!
Respect me, Zé.
- You ain't easy. But I like the hard way.
- No! No!
I want you to be mine.
And I always get what I want.
No! Help!
No! No!
Snake from hell.
You'll be very quiet.
Help!
No! No!
Help! Help!
No! No!
Mercy!
That's right, this is the way I like it.
You'll give me the son I want.
You've ruined me, Zé.
I can't go on living.
I'm going to kill myself.
It's always like that...
All women say the same thing.
Later they regret it.
Life is good, it's not worth trading for death.
I'll be back some other time, Terezinha.
I'll kill myself, Zé, but I promise you'll not have any peace
You killed Antônio and he was buried at midnight.
And at midnight, Zé, you'll know fear, because I'll come to take your soul!
Whereveryou take me, if there are women like you,
I'll be happy to go!
Excuse me...
Today is my lucky day.
The devil himself is here, right?
Spirits!
Spirits!
Do you hear me?
Which of you is going to take my soul?
Behold... I'm waiting!
Arise! Out of your graves... and take me straight to hell!
Can't you hear me?
Can't you hear me?
Take me straight to hell!
Antônio!
I possessed Terezinha.
What will you do to me?
Nothing!
Because you no longer exist!
You're dead!
Dead!
Your hour is coming.
Your end is near.
You'll feel the burden of your sins.
Shut up, old witch.
I'll make your coffin.
Scom the living!
Mock the dead!
You'll live the horrors from hell!
With these few lines, I ask my parents for forgiveness, for my condemnable act.
There's nobody to blame in this tragedy,
I couldn't support the weight on my shoulders.
If must have a sentence for the reason of my death,
I'll be the judge, and wherever
I may be, justice will be fulfilled. Terezinha
How can we charge him, if she left a note explaining why she did it?
There's something strange here.
I can't figure why she didn't put the blame on Zé do Caixão
Idiot!
She had the courage to kill herself.
Strange... she didn't blame me.
Let his soul rest in peace.
Her father insisted she be buried next to Antônio.
Through this letter,
I came to the autorities... to request urgent autorization... to proceed a new autopsy on Antônio's corpse.
Thinking about the last events occurred in this city,
I came to believe that we are dealing with... homi...
Good evening, doctor
Did I frighten you?
Hmm... savior of mankind!
But the people doesn't care for that.
The report is only a formality.
Sorry I'm so curious to read your work, but...
As they say, eyes are made for seeing.
What are you trying to do, Zé?
Nothing.
Just making sure your eyes don't see what they shouldn't
Sorry, doctor.
You make me so happy!
I can't help but feeljealous.
I want so much to make you happy!
We're going to remodel this house and live here together for the rest of our lives.
At midnight, Zé, you'll know fear, because I'll come to take your soul!
- What are you trying to do, Zé?
- I want to make you happy!
Together, for the rest of our lives.
I'll come to take your soul!
- What are you trying to do, Zé?
- Make you happy!
I'll come to take your soul!
- What are you trying to do, Zé?
- Make you happy
For the rest of our lives.
I'll come to take your soul!
- What are you trying to do, Zé?
- Make you happy!
Lenita!
Antônio!
Rodolfo!
You're all dead.
I did it foryou, Terezinha.
You've forsaken me.
You didn't give me a son.
You've doomed my bloodline to extinction.
I want a son!
Damn you! Curse your faith!
Terezinha!
Come out of nowhere... and punish the crime of my passion!
Torture my flesh!
Take my soul!
Why don't you come?
You're a ghost from the past.
Yet, I feel the blood boiling in my veins.
I'm alive!
Alive, understood?
You are dead!
Rotted!
Eaten by worms!
HEAVEN!
HELL!
REINCARNATION!
The power offaith!
Symbol of ignorance!
Where are you, Satan?
Lies! Lies!
May the earth crack open!
May the skies be torn!
I want the end of the world!
I challenge your power!
I deny your existence!
Nothing exists. Only life
Nothing's stronger than my disbelief
Destroy me! I have no faith.
I want the proof of the punishment!
Lies!
What an unfortunate accident.
Asad loss for our town.
Such is life. Excuse me, gentlemen.
Evidence! Evidence, my friends.
Well, it's nine o'clock.
Today is Day of the Dead.
Time to go home.
Yes. The night is pitch black.
I should be going, too.
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow
What's the hurry, fellas?
Today is the Day of the Dead.
We shouldn't be out.
To believe such ridiculous nonsense.
It's not nonsense, Mr. Zé.
Last year Gumercindo scoffed, and had the punishment.
He saw the wandering ghosts.
It's true, Mr. Zé.
You shouldn't make fun tonight.
Oryou'll may watch the Procession of the Dead
Procession of the Dead...
It's a bedtime story forchildren.
Everyone has a right to their own beliefs.
Okay then, you win!
No more talk of that.
Now you won't go home.
Stay and have a drink with me, right?
Anyone turning me down?
Not at all, Mr. Zé.
I like men with strong opinions.
Chico, drinks for everyone.
Don't you want a drink, fellas?
Come, have a drink! Drink!
Maria.
Here's a small gift for being so kind to me.
No, Mr. Zé, I can't accept it.
Look, my uncle is coming.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
I'm here to pick you up, Maria.
It's very late.
I was just about to leave, if Bonifácio can follow me.
Were you paid today?
No, uncle, Mr. Zé gave it to me as a gift.
Take your money back!
My niece will take no gift from you.
I gave her the money, and I want her to have it.
If you'll not take it back, it stays right here.
Let's go, Maria.
Old man.
Pick up that money!
Pick up that money! NOW!
Enough! This man has pushed us around for too long!
Time to settle it for good!
I'll not pick up that money!
I'll not pick up that money!
What will you do to me now?
What will you do to me now,
Zé do Caixão?
What will you do to me now?
What will you do to me now?
I'll not pick up that money, do you undertand, Zé do Caixão?
I'll not pick up that money!
Uncle, uncle...
Pick up that money!
I'm going to count to three...
One...
Two...
THREE!
Give it to your niece.
Good evening, gentlemen.
It's all closed in this town.
This is the only place I found open.
There was nowhere
I could go for information.
How can we help you, ma'am?
I'd like to know where the Queiroz family's house is.
I'm here to visit her, but there was no one to pick me up at the station, because I missed the afternoon train.
But, lady, Mrs. Matilde lives far from here...
Her house is beyond the cemetery.
But could anyone of you take me there?
Not tonight, you'll not find anyone.
I'm willing to pay.
No money in the world would be enough.
Today is Day of the Dead, and no one goes out at this hour.
What am I going to do?
I don't know anyone in town and, for what I saw, there are no hotels.
Don't worry.
If you'll allow me,
I'd be honored to escort you.
I'm at your service.
I appreciate it, gentleman.
I don't know how could I thank you.
My reward is to walk with such a beautiful lady.
You are very kind.
You could stay at my place tonight and I'll take you tomorrow.
Thanks. But I'd rather go tonight.
Any other question, gentlemen?
If any of you think yourselves brave enough
I'll gladly step aside.
Let's go?
Ah, by the way...
If I meet a corpse along the way,
I'll send him your regards!
I noticed that the people here are very superstitious.
They try to cover their fear, they're all a bunch of cowards
- Aren't you afraid?
- Of spirits from beyond?
I may fearsome of the living, but I can protect myselffrom them.
Well, you'll have to admit that the night is really cold and dark
A night like any other.
How many births and deaths are happening this very night?
You're right;
I don't believe in this nonsense, either...
Don't be frightened. It's the old witch!
Beware!
Beware of the DEAD!
Go to hell, sorceress!
When you hear the wind blowing over the trees, it'll not be the wind... but the wandering ghosts.
Don't wait until midnight.
When you see a black cat in your path, it'll be the Devil.
When you hear footsteps and there's no one behind you, it'll be the damnation of your soul.
When you hear the death call of the owl, it'll be the harbinger of your end.
Don't wait until midnight.
When you see light in your path, it'll be the candles of the Procession of the Dead.
RUN AWAY!
Because they'll come for your soul!
My God, what a horrible laughter!
I'll take care of you on my way back, witch!
Let's go, my dear.
Well, here we are, and now I bid you farewell.
But why? Would you like come in?
Thank you.
I don't get along with your aunt, and I'd rather not be seen by her.
Well, I hope to see you again before I go.
Don't worry. I'll make sure of that.
My name is Marta Queiroz.
I am Zé... to my friends.
Hmm, looks like someone is coming.
I should go.
- So long, Marta.
- Good night, Zé.
She's pretty.
If I play right, she won't escape me.
When you hear the wind blowing over the trees, it'll not be the wind... but the wandering ghosts.
When you see a black cat in your path, it'll be the Devil.
Don't wait until midnight.
Who's following me?
Who wants to play with me?
Look out! Look out! I'll shoot!
When you hear footsteps and there's no one behind you, it'll be the damnation of your soul.
Don't wait until midnight.
I must be impressionable tonight.
It was only an owl.
When you hear the death call of the owl, it'll be the harbinger of your end.
Don't wait until midnight.
A light?
I'm safe! I'm safe!
It'll be the candles of the Procession of the Dead.
No, no... it can't be real!
It must be an hallucination!
No, no... no!
Lies!
No, no...
They are dead! DEAD!
I know it... I KNOW IT!
No... I must see them.
I must see them!
I must see them.
No... I don't believe it!
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!
Lies! Lies! Lies!
There was a terrible noise.
I was too frightened to go alone.
Something must have happened here.
THE END
Now, look right.
Left.
They're both fine.
Retina's clear, muscles are perfect.
How is my vision, Doctor?
Excellent, Doctor, as we previously tested.
Let's sit over here.
Why are you really here, James?
As I told you, to get my eyes examined.
Let's have another look.
You had the same examination three months ago.
What makes you think your eyes have changed in three months?
Nothing. Nothing yet.
Then this has something to do with your research.
You're planning to experiment upon yourself, aren't you?
All right.
You're a fine doctor.
You know what you're doing.
But you only have one pair of eyes.
And with them I want to see.
You see fine.
Sam, what's the range of human vision?
- Distance?
- No, wavelength.
Between 4,000 angstrom units and 7,800 angstrom units.
You know that.
Less than one-tenth of the actual wave spectrum.
What could we really see if we had access to the other 90%?
Sam, we are virtually blind. All of us.
You tell me that my eyes are perfect.
Well, they're not.
I'm blind to all but a tenth of the universe.
My dear friend, only the gods see everything.
My dear doctor,
I'm closing in on the gods.
Go ahead, Doctor, make a diagnosis.
Foreign object.
Bullet, it looks like, in the chest cavity.
All right. How about this one?
Lesion in the heart area, maybe in the lungs.
Might be carcinoma.
Or a clot. Or just a fog on the plate.
Could be any number of things.
But what is it, really?
Just a shadow play.
A pattern to be used for intelligent guesswork.
A slight help towards saving the life of the man who made those shadows.
Immense help, Dr. Xavier.
When you have nothing better, anything is an immense help.
That's light.
Waves of energy that excite the eye.
And the nerve cells transmit this energy to the brain.
And with the brain, we see.
But there are other forms of energy with different wavelengths.
Dr. Xavier, I've read your report.
Yes, but do you understand it?
Have you any idea what I'm trying to accomplish here?
Dr. Fairfax, I'm developing a way to sensitize the human eye so that it sees radiation, up to and including the gamma rays and the meson wind.
Yes, I understand.
I understood your objective when I first read your report.
Then why are you here?
Because the report in question was dated nine months ago.
Because since that time, you have drawn over $27,000 of the foundation's money and we haven't had a word from you.
- Well, there have been problems.
- Then report them.
To whom, a group of businessmen who can't tell one quantum jump from another?
No, to me.
The foundation found your research worthy of support.
They also appointed me as liaison to these special projects.
Listen, Doctor,
I've given up my own research to help the foundation and I won't be talked to as if I were a child in kindergarten.
I knew of your reputation, but I hadn't heard about your temper.
- Now, Doctor...
- You want a progress report?
I'll give you something better.
A demonstration.
Come with me.
Doctor Morgan...
You can be of some help.
Put these on.
Now, these are hormones, enzymes.
Their megalostructures have been slightly altered.
Prepare that one in number two, the second cage down.
He won't bite you.
It's all right.
Now, this compound, when used in the eye, increases receptivity.
The sensitivity is enormously increased.
- Well, you've tried it?
- No.
Well, you're blunt, Doctor.
The monkey's been conditioned, standard pleasure-pain technique.
Come on.
Come on.
All right, bring him here.
Put him there.
Now, when he sees the white, he'll pull the corresponding switch and the light will go on.
When he sees the blue, he'll do the same thing and the blue light will go on.
And the same thing with the red.
Now, watch.
Nothing up the sleeves.
White, the one he normally sees.
But he can't see the blue.
It's covered by the white screen.
But he does see it.
And the red. He sees the red.
Well, they're both covered.
But don't you understand yet? He sees through them, as if they were glass.
What did he see?
What did he see?
Thanks, Doctor.
Can't find a thing.
The tissues are fine.
The autopsy?
Heart failure, nothing else.
I'd call it shock.
Because of what it saw?
No, because it couldn't comprehend or adjust to what it saw or saw through.
That's all.
No pathology, no degeneration, tissues perfectly healthy.
Dr. Fairfax...
I think after tonight's work, you can call me Diane.
Thank you.
I'd like to buy you a cup of coffee.
That's the best experiment
I've heard all night.
You're on, Doctor.
Do you take it black?
- Yes.
- Good.
Now, you're a pretty good worker.
Why did you give up research and take to moneylending?
I don't lend it, I give it away.
A million dollars before breakfast every morning.
How do your eggs taste then?
Flat.
You didn't answer my question.
I did, in a way.
When the foundation picked me for the job,
I didn't want it, and then I did.
Why?
Because it needed somebody who cared, somebody who would support some of the...
Well, more untraveled paths.
Like mine?
James, why do you want to see so much?
Well, why do you want to go on breathing? To stay alive.
It's much the same thing with me.
I'm curious, intensely curious.
No, I mean the purpose.
How can you use your new vision?
There are thousands of ways.
You're sitting right on top of probably the most important one right here.
In this hospital, there are people I can help.
Help by seeing inside them, as if they were windows.
By seeing their sicknesses with a clarity that would make X-rays a tool fit only for witchdoctors.
Your foundation doesn't like my work, does it?
They want you to appear before them the day after tomorrow.
I'll be there, and I'll bring them much more than a report.
No, it's too dangerous.
Then who is going to try it?
Some student? Some intern?
Yes. Or better yet, some convicted murderer.
Anyone who has less to lose than you.
And how are they going to report it?
"My eyes feel funny"?
"Gee, Doc, I've got a headache"?
That monkey died.
It was a monkey, not a man.
- I tell you, no.
- Yes.
I won't be a party to it.
All right. I'll proceed without you.
Sam.
Sam, I need you.
- All right. When do you want to do it?
- Now.
August 14th, notes on experiment designated "X."
Experimental subject myself,
James Xavier.
Assisting in experiment,
Dr. Samuel Brant.
You ready, Doctor?
Ready, Doctor.
The compound fully described in a written report has been prepared.
Dr. Brant will administer one drop into each eye of the subject.
One drop. Any choice?
Yeah. One in the middle.
Tilt your head and look directly up.
Well, here it goes, James. Good luck.
How long?
Eight to 10 seconds.
All right, open your eyes.
James?
It's like a splitting of the world.
Vision is fragmented.
More light than I've ever seen.
Filled with light.
I have to close them.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I'm gonna try again.
Everything is normal.
Wait.
Sam, I can see through it.
Right through it.
"The exact combination of hormones and enzymes
"is to be determined by analysis."
Good Lord, Jim.
You can!
Sam, your lab coat.
My coat?
There's a pen in your shirt pocket.
And there's a button missing under your tie.
Sam, it works.
It works!
I still have just penetrated the surface.
My eyes are not quite conditioned yet.
But it's a start.
Sam, another drop in each eye.
Not now. There should be tests.
There might be side effects.
All right, I'll do it myself.
The light!
The light!
Well, that's the tape, gentlemen.
And, of course, the reason
Dr. Xavier can't be present today.
I've asked Dr. Brant to represent him here.
Dr. Xavier has been unconscious since yesterday, when this experiment took place.
I've been asked by Dr. Fairfax to speak on his behalf about the continuation of his research funds.
Now, you read the reports, you heard the tape of Dr. Xavier's first experiment.
I think, gentlemen, you will agree that a fantastic breakthrough is possible.
Unbelievable might be a better choice.
Dr. Xavier is unable to speak for himself, but his work speaks for him.
It can and will be repeated by others besides himself.
It is up to this foundation to finance the further work that is necessary.
I must confess to you, Doctor, that I don't believe in the continuance of this work. I mean...
Well, there still is nothing positive that has come out of it.
But, Mr. Bowhead...
I'm very sorry, Dr. Fairfax, but I believe our foundation can no longer channel its funds into this work.
And that's all. They voted against you.
I tried. Dr. Brant.
- Sam and I, we've tried.
- Everything.
They decided to withhold the funds.
So, they cut me off like an arm with gangrene.
- Maybe they're right.
- No, they're wrong.
And I'll show them just how wrong.
We better leave now. He needs rest.
James, I'll order the bandages removed tomorrow.
Bandages?
Yes. I hardly noticed them.
Hardly noticed them at all.
- You'll get your chance again, James.
- Yes, I will.
I think it's for the best, in any case.
You need a rest from research.
A return to doctoring will be just the right prescription.
- Maybe the hospital could...
- No, we've been through it before.
We need all our funds just to keep this place going.
Well, that's it.
I want you in surgery tomorrow.
You'll assist me.
Why, thank you, Dr. Benson, thank you.
It's nice to have you back with us.
You might look in on a patient named Stanton in Ward three.
I've left the reports and the diagnosis on your desk.
Right.
May I help you, Doctor?
Yes, a patient named Stanton?
Yes, right over here.
- Thank you. That'll be all, nurse.
- Yes, Doctor.
He's wrong.
The diagnosis is wrong.
Doctor?
Your eyes.
Go back to sleep, dear.
Pretty, isn't she?
Yes, very.
Doctor, I want you to reconsider this operation.
Why?
You say she has a stenosis.
You're wrong.
It's a tumor directly in the auricle attached to the valve.
Nonsense.
The X-rays were taken from every angle.
Dr. Benson, I know what I'm saying.
You'll be cutting into the wrong area of the heart.
Doctor, I shall expect you in surgery at 6:00.
I will perform the operation exactly as I outlined it.
Thank you, Doctor. Yes, right away.
Doctor, someone...
Are you all right?
Yes, just a temporary headache.
- May I get you something?
- No. No, thank you.
- There's someone waiting for you, Doctor.
- All right.
I was waiting for you.
James, what's wrong?
It's nothing. It's just a readjustment.
Your eyes.
- You're continuing to use the...
- Yes, I am.
The vision comes and goes.
But tonight I saw very clearly, very deeply.
And what the devil are you doing here so late?
A surprise for you.
Bo, not another one.
My life's too full of them.
Come along.
Where are you dragging me?
I have young friends who have a cure.
For what disease?
Intense doctors.
Dr. Holmes...
About 10 ccs, Doctor.
- Exactly.
- Beautiful. Beautiful.
Be my guest.
Here you are, perfect martinis.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Ethyl or gin?
Well, in deference to your high standings,
Doctors, gin.
I think I got formaldehyde.
- It's been nice talking to you.
- It's all right, I love it.
Well, are you enjoying yourself?
Well, who couldn't around you?
My, you're almost romantic.
Well, it's just a passing symptom.
I don't think
I want you cured after all.
My dance, Doctor.
As one of your ex-students,
I have rights.
- That'll be all right.
- Excuse us.
Hi.
Hi, I said.
Hi.
I saw you clear across from over there.
Gee, you've got sharp eyes.
When I use them.
I want you to dance with me.
I like the way you look, kind of urgent.
I like men who look urgent.
- I'll remember that.
- Come on.
Headache?
Headache?
No, it's just my eyes.
You like the way I dance?
It's fine. It's just fine.
Jim? My turn, now.
- Did you find that fun?
- Yes. Yes.
- You know, you're quite lovely.
- Thank you.
Matter of fact, you're very attractive.
Well, one drink certainly makes you a different man.
Well, you could say I'm really seeing you for the first time.
And that's the most interesting birthmark you have above the third rib on your left side.
But how do you know that?
Why, you can see me.
And your backbone's a sheer delight.
But remember, I am a doctor.
Well, you remember that I'm a woman.
I can hardly forget it.
Come on, I'm getting you out of here.
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning, nurse.
Good morning, James.
Good morning, Doctor.
Are you all right?
Yes. Perfectly all right.
Why do you want me here?
I don't know. I think I'm afraid.
Diane, what do you know?
Only that he's been using the drug again.
Ready.
Doctor, you must reconsider the procedure.
Scalpel.
Let go of my hand.
Doctor, I shall perform this operation.
James, have you gone out of your mind?
No, but I want this girl to live.
Second blade. I'm going to continue.
It seems, Doctor, you are now unable to continue.
James, you've gone mad.
No.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
More exactly than any other doctor's ever known before.
You think I'm mad?
Well, watch. All of you, just watch.
You know of my experiments.
Dr. Benson knows.
What I'm doing is a direct result of those experiments.
I can see the heart and the lungs and the internal structures quite clearly.
Doctor, we could stop him.
No.
Swab.
All right.
You see, Dr. Benson, no stenosis.
- Take the patient into recovery.
- Yes, Doctor.
Dr. Xavier, are you finished?
Yes. I'm sorry, there was nothing else I could do, but the girl will live.
Dr. Ryan, will you write the postoperative orders?
You know what you did was unethical.
I had no choice.
You realize that news of it has probably spread through the hospital, perhaps even reached the papers.
You saw what I've accomplished.
I don't know what I saw.
But this I do know.
You will be tried for malpractice.
- Jim.
- Diane.
- You've got to get away from here.
- You're coming with us.
Yes, I'm very tired.
L, T, N,
U, E,
X.
James. James.
Yes, it persists.
The effect is cumulative.
I see veins, organs, the blood rushing through your heart.
I look at Diane, and she appears a perfect, breathing dissection.
But, Jim, there must be some way to control it.
Of course.
Ask your foundation for the money to discover it.
We don't need the foundation, any of them.
- We'll work together. We'll find a reversal.
- No.
That's just what I don't want.
I'm going on.
You can't. I won't permit it.
The drug works upon the eyes.
- They're the direct route into the brain.
- I don't care.
What is happening is beyond my hopes.
A cumulative effect.
Soon, I'll be able to see what no man has ever seen.
And, Sam, I want you with me.
With new eyes, we'll explore all the mysteries of creation.
With knowledge there is power.
The power to learn, to create, to do.
I proved it today.
Jim, who knows what other parts of your mind are affected by this thing.
Sam.
Jim, it's the only way.
Someone has to care for you.
Now, push up your sleeve.
No!
You killed him.
- Yes.
- Jim.
- He was my friend.
- You've got to get away.
But you saw what happened.
They won't believe me, not after the operation.
They'll think you're insane.
Insane?
Insane?
Diane, do you...
The police.
Jim, you've got no time.
They'll blame you no matter what we say.
One of the most fantastic performances ever to appear here in the carnival show.
And you'll enjoy the fabulous things he can do with his fantastic eyes and mind.
Hey, you boys over there.
You two fellows, step right over here, you're embarrassing the girls.
Come on over here and see a show.
We're gonna present to you one of the finest shows on earth.
Big deal.
Hey, buddy, how would you like it if I step on your hands?
Nobody likes a wise guy.
This man, ladies and gentlemen, he can read your mind.
Tell you what you're thinking.
Can he tell me where my wife is?
Yeah, buddy, on a broom flying around the pier.
That's where your wife is.
I need guys like you.
Come on, you people, he's ready to begin.
The man they call Mentallo.
The Mentallo, the man with the miraculous mind.
Step right up, folks.
You're in for one of the greatest, exciting evenings of your life.
Good crowd.
Yes, I know.
All right, everybody. All right, gang.
Here he is, Mentallo.
Write your thoughts down here and he will read them to you just by pressing them against his forehead.
Anything you wanted to write, anything at all.
How about my mother-in-law's will?
I hope she leaves a picture of your wife, smart guy.
Ask him where you get those clothes.
The same Army & Navy store you bought yours. Okay?
Here's a pencil. Come on, gang.
He's a fake. I know how they do this.
The first paper he gets is a phony.
When he opens the second one to check on it, he's really reading the first.
He's one ahead the whole time. Smart.
Smart? I heard that, too.
Everybody, let's feed the monkeys, so we can go on with the show.
All right, pal?
You got a thought, or do you wanna sit there and play with your blocks?
I could play with your blocks.
Here, give him this.
Real smart kid.
I love those kind of guys.
We meet them every time here, but doesn't phase Mentallo.
He'll answer every one of them.
Here we go. Here you are.
This is from a lady who wants to know if
I wear this outfit to pin tails on donkeys.
See? That's the ringer.
That's the ringer, smart guy?
What are you, Dick Tracy?
How about that, folks?
That's exactly what the young lady said.
That's right.
If the lady will step forward,
I will demonstrate.
This is from a man who wants to know how much money he has in his pocket.
- There it is.
- I spent it all to get in here.
If the gentleman will stand up,
I will tell him.
Judging from your appearance,
I would say a quarter.
This is from a young man who says I am a fake.
Would you like a further demonstration of my powers?
- It's a trick.
- Is it?
Your name is John Trask.
You've come from Phoenix.
You're 27 years of age, you're unmarried.
Your social security number is
You have a watch on your person, a gift from your father.
How do you know that?
You also have a letter in your pocket from a girl you deserted.
A girl who loves you.
Shut up.
This is your trick, ain't it?
I have no trick.
You gotta. Everybody does.
It's in the mask.
Can you see through it?
No.
There's a switch or something.
No switch.
Then, how?
Look, you can trust me.
You've been on the pier a month now, and nobody's caught on.
You've got something great here. Great.
Thank you.
In fact, it's so great,
I sometimes wonder what you're doing here on the small-time hustle.
What do you mean?
I didn't mean nothing.
Except, I wonder, what do you want, Mr. Mentallo?
Please leave.
I didn't mean nothing.
Come on, get out.
September 19th, the fluid is almost gone.
I use only the smallest amounts now, but the effect seems to be cumulative.
But how can I work without a laboratory, without equipment, without money to buy what I need?
There's so much undone, so much I don't understand.
He drove them off today like they were scared.
I saw them run from his show.
Said he saw too much.
He's all right, does his job.
He keeps to himself.
Why not? He's got a right.
Does he? We all live and work together.
He gives me the creeps.
Maybe we give him the creeps.
Did you ever see his eyes?
He always wears those glasses and that mask.
Now, Crane hustles for him.
Crane, he thinks he's real.
Real? What do you think, he's a ghost?
Well, what he does is real. No tricks.
- Coffee?
- Sure, you bet.
Two coffees.
He sees not through your mind, but through things like paper and cloth.
- He's got a good act, that's all.
- No.
Yeah, an act. What else could it be?
A man that could really see through things, he wouldn't be here. No, he wouldn't.
He'd be something big, powerful.
He'd be something special.
What would he be?
He'd know secrets. Secrets he could use.
A hold on people, that's what he would have.
Something to make them listen to him.
That what you think?
I never think. I eat.
Maybe he could help keep people from hurting each other.
How?
By telling everybody everything.
No secrets, what's anybody got to fight about?
Same things they've always fought about.
Ideas, thoughts, differences.
I'd stop them.
If I had your power, I'd stop them.
I'd make them do things my way or I'd hurt them all, if I had your trick.
Trick? I thought you said it was real.
Man was real, he wouldn't be here.
Maybe this is all he could be.
This, and nothing more.
Nothing more than just a man.
Fake. Cheap fake.
Don't pay them no mind.
Me, I know what you got is real.
And you, what do you want to see?
All the undressed women my poor eyes could stand.
And you?
What about you, Mr. Mentallo?
First, money.
And then, to be able to open my eyes.
A wonderful performance.
- Green, go get a doctor, quick.
- Right.
She's got a broken leg.
Crane, get some wood for splints and some rope.
She's also got two broken ribs.
How do you know?
Never mind.
Take hold of her, it's gonna hurt.
Take it easy.
- These are all I could find.
- They'll do.
- The doctor's on his way.
- Good.
I also saw two broken ribs.
Hang on to this while I immobilize this leg.
You've got the power, the power to see inside.
Shut up.
- Here he comes now. Here he is.
- Here comes the doctor.
Good. He can take over.
- You ain't no mind-reader.
- No?
But I know what you are.
What am I?
You're a healer. A healer of the sick.
I watched you over there.
You looked right through that girl and you knew what was wrong.
A broken leg shows.
But not broken ribs.
I couldn't see nothing.
Don't you understand?
It means money, more money than you could make in 10 years working on the pier.
You can heal them just by laying on your hands.
You're out of your mind.
But you can look right through a guy and see what's wrong with him, can't you?
You said you wanted money, didn't you?
We could set up a place in the city.
Nothing fancy, no advertising.
Just through word.
When you're poor, the word gets around about a man that can heal just by looking.
And we don't charge them a thing, not one penny.
What about your money then, Mr. Crane?
Donations, Mr. Mentallo.
Everybody gives what he can.
Just what he can.
Here it is.
It ain't much, but you said it don't matter.
Any other rooms?
Two, the bedroom and another storage room about half the size of this one.
- Let's see them.
- Right.
The one in the back is the storage room.
Wait. I'll tell you this once, and that's all.
You will never enter these rooms.
Never, under any circumstances.
All right, all right.
Whatever you say, Doc.
He's there.
It's just like I said, honest.
I'm afraid, Mr. Crane.
Now, you come along.
Maybe he will, maybe he won't.
- He's asleep.
- It won't take a second.
Healer, I brought you someone.
Who are you?
It's me, Crane. Don't you remember?
Yes. Crane.
I didn't mean to wake you.
I brought Mrs. Mart. This is her.
She says she's pained and sick to death.
I thought you might be willing to tell her something.
I have this pain in my back.
It's tight, like a fist. And it grows.
I think it's a cancer come to eat me.
It's nothing. Nothing.
Just tiredness and age, and nothing.
And the pain?
It'll be gone soon.
I was afraid, but you are a good man.
She's going.
She's beyond my help.
She said you were a good man.
I guess she knows.
She's a smart old woman.
She'll pass the word.
What?
You're a healer. You can heal.
I can't heal. I only look.
And I tell what I see.
Sure. I know what you mean, Doc.
But that's enough.
You wait and see.
In one week's time, this place will be so packed you'll be turning them away.
The effects of the compound are still unpredictable.
At times,
I can see through walls, through stone just as easily as I can see through the air.
At other times, I can hardly penetrate the first layer of a man's skin.
Sometimes I wonder why I keep on searching.
I don't want power or fame or...
I told you never to set foot in here.
Yeah.
You got quite a setup here.
You got people waiting, lots of them.
I'll be with them in a minute.
You better come now.
Here he is now.
Here he is.
All right, everybody, just take it easy.
The healer will see everybody in a few minutes.
You, miss.
Hey, hey, you ain't in line.
I'm his friend.
I never saw you before.
I've never been here before.
Hey!
Sit down.
There's nothing wrong with you, young lady.
You're perfectly healthy.
Why are you here?
To see you, Jim.
- Diane?
- Yes.
How did you find me?
I left the foundation, took up my practice again.
Patients. First one, then others.
They came to me for treatment knowing exactly what was wrong with them.
Only one man could tell them that.
It took me more than a month to find you, but I knew who I was looking for.
I didn't want to see you again.
But I'm here now.
Yes. If what I'm seeing is really you.
No, don't. It's worse without them.
- The "X" effect?
- Yes.
Double. Sometimes triple.
And sometimes, when I look up and I see all those people above me, pressing down upon me, the whole of humanity.
And at night, while they sleep,
I close my eyes and I can still see through my own eyelids.
Oh, Lord.
I'd give anything, anything to have dark.
I've come to help, if I can.
You can't go on like this.
They're bound to discover you.
You've got to go away somewhere where it's safe.
No, no. You ain't going nowhere.
I'm not letting you go.
Not when things are just starting to pay off.
Haven't you had enough out of their misery?
Only my share.
My share for keeping you out of the hands of the cops.
I've got my power over you,
Mr. Mentallo.
Dr. James Xavier.
I've known about you for some time.
Ever since we hit this town.
But I don't care.
As long as I get my share.
Get out of my sight.
Get out of my way!
You leave now and I'll turn you in, that's what I'll do.
I'll see you hang, you murderer!
No, you're not gonna get out of here.
I'll tell you that.
You're not gonna get out.
You won't get away!
He ain't no healer. He ain't.
He looks inside you and he gives you the sickness. And you die! Killer!
- Murderer!
- Watch out!
Murderer! Police, police!
What do you see?
This city, as if it were unborn, rising into the sky with fingers of metal, limbs without flesh, girders without stone, signs hanging without support, wires dipping and swaying without poles.
A city unborn, its flesh dissolved in an acid of light.
A city of the dead.
Diane, I'm sorry, but I've got to get away.
I must go somewhere I can work, where I can solve this thing,
- learn to control it.
- Where?
Anywhere. Across the border, anywhere where I can work.
- It'll take money.
- I know.
Would you come with me?
Yes.
You know, across the desert is a place where they have more money than I'll ever need.
And I can get it.
As a matter of fact, I'm the only man in the world, probably, who can get it and get away with it.
You wait here. I'll be back in a moment.
You've taken the drug again.
I had to. The effect is wearing down.
Are you all right?
For what I have to do, yes. Come on.
- Are you nearly finished with this machine?
- This machine's nearly finished me.
It's set to jackpot in two plays.
Here.
- I don't gamble.
- This is not gambling.
Well, what next?
Over there.
Eighteen.
Can't win them all, darling.
Hit me.
Fine.
Twenty. Pay the point.
Twenty-one.
You don't seem very worried.
It's the house's money.
Ain't mine, win or lose.
Blackjack.
Blackjack pays one-and-a-half times.
Hit me.
- He can't lose.
- Again.
Once more.
Fine.
Twenty.
Twenty-one.
This table is closed.
All right,
I'll play over at that table, then.
Give me your bag.
Jim, you've got enough, nearly $20,000.
I could go on winning forever.
They can't stop me from winning.
I'll show you how to win.
Now, wait a minute.
- Deal.
- Cut.
I believe you.
I stand.
Don't draw. Don't draw.
Why not?
Because you've got 16 there.
The next card's a face card.
Jim, please, we'd better cash in and get out of here.
All right. Pay me.
Pardon me, sir,
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Questions?
You won a lot of money.
I'd like to make sure you won it honestly.
- What's it matter to you?
- Jim.
Look! Look!
- No.
- Look at his eyes.
- What's the matter with him?
- No!
No!
Look at his eyes.
No!
Something's real wrong with this one.
Harry, you better go for the sheriff right now.
Jim, they're calling the police.
It's free. It's free.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Attention, James Xavier.
This is the California Highway Patrol.
Attention. You can't escape.
I repeat, you can't escape.
All forces have been alerted.
Give yourself up.
Stop and give yourself up.
All roads are blocked.
Let me sing hallelujah
When he comes, hallelujah
Let me sing hallelujah
Let me sing hallelujah
Let me sing hallelujah
Let me sing hallelujah
Let me sing hallelujah
On that day
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
The children of God.
Amen.
For we are truly God's children.
Hallelujah.
He will guard and protect us against the ravages of sin.
Amen.
Now tell me, whom do we love?
The Lord!
Yes, we love the Lord.
And what do we hate?
Sin!
Yes, we hate sin. We must destroy it.
Hallelujah.
And how shall we save our souls?
Go forth.
Then come forward and save your soul.
Come forward and save your soul.
Are you a sinner?
Do you wish to be saved?
Saved? No.
I've come to tell you what I see.
There are great darknesses, farther than time itself.
And beyond the darkness, a light that glows and changes.
And in the center of the universe, the eye that sees us all.
No!
You see sin and the Devil.
But the Lord has told us what to do about it.
Said Matthew in Chapter Five,
"If thine eye offends thee,
"pluck it out."
Pluck it out! Pluck it out!
Pluck it out!
Pluck it out?
Pluck it out! Pluck it out!
Pluck it out!
Pluck it out! Pluck it out!
Pluck it out!
In a hurry, aren't you?
What are you running for?
You're covered in blood.
How did you get covered in all this blood?
Now, the blood. Now, whose is it, and where did it come from?
Now, come on, come on.
The old Herzeg house.
Outside town.
Yes, yes, the Herzeg house.
Yes, yes.
Cellar.
A man in a glass case...
Head...
Head.
What do you think you're doing?
I'm sorry, sir. One of our men found Dr. Heidecke in his doorway.
His head's been cut off.
- Do you see anything?
- No, sir. I can hear water though.
Well, inspector, I'd say you have the crime of the century.
If that's what you want.
I wouldn't like to have to find the reasons for it.
Well, whoever left this amount of evidence is a fool.
I'll soon find him.
Inspector, I know doctors.
Very few of them are fools.
Oh, so it was a doctor, was it?
Thank you.
Doesn't it look like it?
You can't buy equipment of this kind over a counter.
When I want your diagnosis,
I'll ask for it.
Doctor.
No one's been living here.
There's some rotting furniture, but that's all.
Thank you, sergeant.
Tomorrow I want your men to check all suppliers of surgical goods...
...laboratory equipment and drugs.
- Yes, sir.
I want the names of all their purchasers for the last year.
- Yes, sir.
- And, sergeant.
- Yes, sir?
I want the names of all...
Of all persons listed as missing.
Yes, sir.
The mortuary attendant, sir.
All right.
Now, I understand you've lost a body.
Dr. Herman Streich, I believe.
Can you tell me for certain when he was last in there?
On the day he was taken in there.
We don't keep going back to look.
They're not expected to walk, are they?
I advise you to be careful.
You have just lost a body.
And that's no cause for funny remarks.
I last saw him when
I slid him into the drawer.
Has anybody recently made inquiries as to who you had lying in there?
- No.
- You're sure?
Not a man with a pockmarked face, for instance. Think hard.
No one. Not with pockmarks, warts, pimples or hairs growing out of his nose.
- We don't have visitors.
- Oh, get out!
Give the duty sergeant a statement on the way.
Damn fool.
Dr. Streich could've been the body in the cellar, I suppose.
Yes.
Yes, it ties in, doesn't it?
Yes, but why?
For what reason, eh?
There's one absolute certainty.
We are looking for a doctor.
Nothing is absolutely certain until it is proven.
At the moment, I believe...
...that we're looking for a mad and highly dangerous medical adventurer.
Whether it's a doctor or not remains to be seen.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
You are advertising vacant accommodation?
Yes, that's right.
Please come in.
Thank you.
- It's a cold evening, isn't it?
- Yes, it is indeed.
I'll show you the rooms that are available.
That won't be necessary.
I'm sure any of them will suit me perfectly.
- Well, if you'll sign the register.
- Of course.
Thank you.
Will you be staying long?
Indefinitely.
Thank you, Mr. Fenner.
My name is Anna Spengler.
- How do you do, Mrs. Spengler?
- Miss.
- I beg your pardon.
- Now, may I show you to your room?
Of course. Thank you.
- Do you run this house alone?
- Yes, I'm afraid I do.
That's quite a task, if I may say so, for one so young.
It belongs to my mother, really.
- She's very old now, and she's retired.
- I see.
I only have four other guests, so...
...you'll find it very quiet here.
- She really wailed that time, Dr. Holst.
- It's the worst she's ever been.
- Spiders again?
- Yeah.
Get on with it.
Hold her legs still.
You can take the jacket off when she's asleep.
Good evening, Professor Richter.
Good evening, doctor.
- How is she?
- Not at all good, sir.
I've given her a few hours' sleep.
And what is your opinion of Dr. Brandt, sir?
I sometimes wonder if we're not all wasting our time.
A man has an abscess, we cut him open, see the abscess.
But a sick brain...
We open the skull, all we can see is the brain.
Of the sickness, there is no sign.
I suggest you tell Mrs. Brandt there's no point in continuing to visit her husband.
It is my opinion that he can never be cured.
What a terrible waste.
Madness is always sad.
But for such a brilliant man to drive himself mad...
...what a terrible waste.
A terrible, terrible waste.
Not very talkative, our new resident.
Damn surly, if you ask me.
Only just about managed to say good evening.
My move, I think.
Oh, yes.
Dreadful business, this Dr. Heidecke getting his head lopped off.
The world's full of maniacs.
Ever cross your mind that you never know who you're standing next to in the street?
Funny you should say that.
Today I stood next to probably the worst madman of the decade.
- Who?
- Dr. Frederick Brandt.
Remember him?
Yes, I do.
But where did you see him?
Not in the street, surely?
Of course not. I had to call at the asylum to discuss a new plumbing installation.
I passed him in the exercise yard.
Name rings a bell, but I can't place it.
He's the doctor who caused an absolute furor in the medical world...
...about five years ago with some...
...fantastic and devilish notion he had about transplanting people's brains.
You know, putting them from one person into another.
And he claimed that anyone undergoing such surgery could survive.
Absolute claptrap.
I seem to recall that another fellow had the same idea at the same time.
A foreigner.
- Oh, dear. What was his name, now?
- Frankenstein.
Baron Frankenstein. Lived in Bohemia.
That's the one.
They were both run out of the medical profession, right?
That's right.
And Frankenstein was run out of his country as well.
The church, in particular, pilloried him.
The devil's disciples, the pair of them.
Of course, it was the work that Brandt was engaged on that sent him mad, you know.
- Well, it must have been.
- Excuse me. I didn't know that you were doctors.
- Doctors? We're not doctors.
I beg your pardon. I thought you knew what you were talking about.
You're damn rude, sir.
Stupidity always brings out the worst in me.
- Stupidity?
- Yes, stupidity.
It is fools like you who have blocked progress throughout the ages.
You make pronouncements on half-facts that you don't understand.
I find your tone and manner highly objectionable, sir.
But if you wish to involve yourself in an argument about it, pray...
...explain the word "progress" in this context.
You wouldn't understand it.
I will give you a parallel that you may just appreciate.
Had man not been given to invention and experiment...
...then tonight you would have eaten dinner in a cave.
You would've strewn the bones about the floor...
...then wiped your fingers on a coat of animal skin.
In fact, your lapels do look somewhat greasy. Good night.
- How was your day?
- Terrible.
But a kiss and a drink will help me forget all about it.
- I think the drink can wait.
- If you want to go to the theater tonight you'd better have that drink.
- Come here.
Anna, you're looking very beautiful tonight.
- Thank you, Dr. Holst.
- So let's put the tickets on the fire.
Karl, it took me two hours to get ready this evening.
And I would like to go to the theater.
- I'll get you that drink.
- Right.
Darling, I had a letter from Mother this morning.
She sounds so much better,
I can't believe it.
Darling, I've told you before not to set your hopes too high.
As yet, there's no cure for her, just temporary relief.
I know.
I heard from the hospital treasurer as well.
The fees are going up again.
It's... It's dreadful that you have to buy a life.
Yes.
So long as nerve specialists are in short supply, we'll have to pay a high price.
- Luckily for us, that's no problem.
- But I worry in case you're discovered.
- It's dangerous, isn't it?
- It isn't dangerous, darling. I promise you.
I've been getting away with it for a year, so stop worrying about it.
- But if you're caught...
- I won't get caught.
I'm in charge of the drugs department,
I add a figure here, subtract one there.
It's all right, Anna. Really.
It's the only way to get the money to keep your mother where she is.
The illegal drug market is one source where money never dries up.
Lock this packet in a bureau,
Anna, will you?
There's no point in taking it to the theater.
Where the devil is it?
- Where did I take my coat off?
- On the doorstep.
It must have fallen out there, or in the hall.
Good evening.
I found this on the doorstep.
It appears to have come from the Holburg Mental Hospital.
- Would it belong to anyone in the house?
- Yes, thank you. It's mine.
Good evening, Mr. Fenner.
This is my fiancé, Dr. Karl Holst.
How do you do?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
How do you do?
- The box, please.
- Oh, yes, of course. I'm sorry.
- It's cocaine. Isn't it?
- Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
We've tickets for the theater this evening, and we're already a little late.
- Do you work at the asylum?
- Yes, I do. Now, if you...
Dedicated men, mental health doctors.
Not a very pleasant job, I should imagine.
It isn't. Get your coat, Anna.
We'd better go.
I trust your mother is not too ill, Miss Spengler.
Doctor, is the Hippocratic oath no longer taken in the profession?
- What do you mean?
- What I said.
- Of course it's still taken.
- Oh, I see.
Then I fancy you do not number yourself among the dedicated men?
Mr. Fenner, forgive me, but I can't stand here all night talking gibberish with you.
- Come along, Anna.
- Neither of you are going anywhere tonight.
- How dare you? What right...?
- I have every right.
You're both engaged in highly illegal business.
Illegal business?
What do you mean?
Come now, Miss Spengler.
You know what I'm talking about.
All right, so you overheard a conversation. Prove it.
The Narcotics Bureau would prove it in no time at all.
It's uncanny how they discover irregularities in their record books.
Haven't you noticed?
What do you want?
The penalties for drug trafficking in this country are the harshest in Europe.
As a medical man, you would get not less than 20 years.
And you, my dear Miss Spengler, would get at least 10.
Can you imagine what you would look like after 10 years in prison?
I'm sure you can, doctor.
- How much do you want?
- Oh, I want no money. I want your help.
What sort of help, for God's sake?
Don't invoke the Almighty. I should think he's very angry with you at the moment.
Sit down.
Both of you, and listen to what I have to say.
I can tell you if there was an official body to complain to...
...I would have you closed down.
We've lived here long enough to regard the place as home.
To be thrown into the street without reasonable warning is utterly disgraceful.
And I think in our own small way, we've been very kind to you over the years.
This is an appalling way to treat us.
It makes a mockery of all trust and standards of decency.
Goodbye.
Thank you, Anna.
Thank you very much.
You sent for me, inspector?
Yes, pack your bag.
You're going up to Altenburg for a while.
- With you?
- Yes, with me.
For how long?
Until I say we come back.
Might I be permitted to ask why we're going?
Yes, you read that.
In the Altenburg area, there've been four robberies in the last two weeks.
All from manufacturers of surgical or laboratory equipment.
And enough stuff has been taken...
...to equip something very similar to what we saw in that cellar.
You've killed him, doctor.
Please, tell me!
What happened tonight?
Tell me.
Karl hasn't spoken since you got back.
- What's wrong with him?
- Why don't you ask him.
Karl.
Don't sit here like this.
Say something.
Please.
I killed a man tonight, Anna.
I killed the night watchman.
I didn't mean to.
Oh, God, I didn't mean to.
I panicked.
Anna, I want you to go away from here.
- You must leave this house tonight.
- Not unless we go together.
We can't go together.
He'll put the police onto us at once.
He says he needs me, and after what I've done tonight he has me completely trapped.
But he doesn't need you.
- You must get away from here tonight.
- No.
Anna, my love...
...if we get caught, you'll go to prison for the rest of your life.
Don't you realize the position you're in?
You're harboring a murderer and an accessory to murder.
I won't go without you, Karl.
I'm as much to blame for all this as you are.
It's my fault you took the drugs.
Even if we escape the consequences of this...
...there's no longer any future for you and me, Anna.
I'm a murderer.
I'm not leaving you, Karl.
No matter what happens.
Such loyalty is most touching.
The plan, Karl.
I trust you didn't forget it.
Who are you?
Did you get the plan?
I'll do no more until you tell me who you really are.
What you're involved in.
Stay where you are.
I am Baron Frankenstein.
Frankenstein.
I thought the world had seen the last of you.
So did a lot of other people.
I have work to do, and you will both give me every assistance.
The plan. Where is it?
- In that case on the table.
- Thank you.
Show me Dr. Brandt's cell.
Well, it's here, but he's a raving madman.
- What do you want with him?
- I intend to get him out, with your help.
Then I shall cure his insanity.
You're as mad as he is.
It's utterly impossible.
Your medical education is soon to be vastly improved.
I tell you, it isn't possible.
We had Professor Richter see Brandt and he says he's a hopeless case.
You can take whatever Richter says as an absolute fact.
Richter. Yes, he's a clever man, up to a point.
But he's not progressive.
You mean you're going to bring a madman to this house and operate on him?
Anna, go and make us some coffee, please.
- You don't need her. Let her go.
- I need her to make coffee. Anna.
- Now, explain the layout of the asylum.
- You're wasting your time.
- You'll never get him out.
- Of course I will.
Remember what happens to you...
...and Anna if I don't.
I find it very hard to accept that there's no hope.
No hope at all?
I most sincerely wish there was better news I could give you, Mrs. Brandt.
But I think it best that you should know the truth.
- Truth?
- Yes.
For the last three months, we've had to take the precaution of sedating him...
...every time you came to visit him.
He's suddenly developed the most violent and murderous rages.
He's drugged at this moment.
And his condition does nothing but deteriorate.
We fear...
...that there is nothing more we can do for him.
Are you sure?
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Absolutely.
And I'm going to suggest to you, Mrs. Brandt...
...that you cease to visit him.
For you, it can only be terribly, terribly painful.
And as for Dr. Brandt...
...he doesn't even know that you're in the room with him.
I couldn't do that.
I couldn't just walk away.
Well, I won't press the point, but I do ask you to consider it.
It can only be upsetting.
Come.
There's a woman in cell six who thinks she sees spiders.
When she does, her screams will wake the dead.
See that she's under sedation the night we go there.
I can't guarantee that.
I don't make out the duty roster.
Then find some way to alter it.
Why are you doing all this?
Brandt has a secret that I must know.
In order to learn that secret...
...I must cure his insanity.
- What secret?
We were involved in the problems of transplanting the human brain.
We both achieved it.
Utterly impossible.
I assure you, it isn't.
We both found a way of making a transplant from one body to another.
We corresponded on the subject.
Our next step was to find a way of freezing brains without destroying the living cells...
...so they could be stored for future use.
My research went badly, but Brandt discovered the technique.
He wrote to me.
And we arranged to meet for the first time.
He was to tell me the secret.
Unfortunately, two days before we were to meet, he went mad.
The pressure of his work had broken him.
He disappeared.
Shortly afterwards,
I was hounded out of the country.
It's horrifying.
But it doesn't explain why you were doing it.
We were seeking to preserve for all time the great talents and geniuses of the world.
When they die, their brains are at the height of their creative power.
And we bury them underground to rot because the bodies that house them have worn out.
We want to remove those brains at the instant of death and freeze them...
...thus preserving for posterity all they contain.
It's frightening.
I shall need Brandt's case history.
Get it for me. Good night.
I beg you.
- Let Anna go.
- Perhaps, when my work is finished.
Thank you for the coffee, Anna.
Yes, all right, all right.
Take him away. Take him away.
Here.
What's been taken?
Surgical knives of various kinds, saws, hypodermic syringes and the like.
- Yeah.
- I'd say for certain, your man is a doctor.
Oh, would you really? I'd be most surprised if you tell me what he looks like.
- How tall he is and his weight.
- I'm sorry. I think...
Look, I do the thinking.
You check the stores.
You'd be well-advised to get younger men to patrol these premises.
That last old chap was 70 if he was a day.
Well, what about this knife wound?
Well, whoever did this knew exactly where he was putting the knife.
- Oh, yes.
- Too exactly to be lucky, I think.
Yes. Oh, yes, yes, yes.
We better start by making a tour of all the derelict and empty properties in this area.
Well, come on.
Come on. Come on.
- Which door, doctor?
- Six.
Dr. Holst!
What the devil do you think you're doing?
I'm putting her under sedation, sir.
She's been having a bad time lately.
I had noticed that, doctor.
I will tell you when to give patients extra sedation.
Inexperience I can excuse, but lack of basic procedure I cannot.
Now, come out of there.
I couldn't sedate her.
The principal caught me in her cell.
Then we'll just have to trust to luck.
Be careful, now.
He can turn savage in a second.
He doesn't like injections.
Don't be afraid, Dr. Brandt.
We're not going to hurt you.
There. Don't be afraid.
No!
- Just relax.
- Watch it!
Hold him! Hold him!
- Hold him. Back in you go!
- I've got him!
Hold him! Hold him!
Hurry.
The dogs, Frankenstein!
They'll get the dogs!
Anna.
- Karl.
- I must get back.
You haven't finished!
Now, Mrs. Brandt, there is a most worrying aspect about all this, you know.
Your husband did not escape from the asylum.
He was taken out.
- Taken out?
- Removed.
Somebody removed him from his cell.
How is that possible, inspector?
Now, Mrs. Brandt, I can lay before you the absolute facts.
But we shall proceed more quickly if you'll take my word for it.
Who'd want to do such a dreadful thing?
And for what reason?
Now, at the asylum we learned that your husband was a doctor...
...who achieved a certain notoriety about five years ago.
- Yes.
- In the line of researchhe was engaged upon, he had a collaborator.
A Baron Frankenstein.
That is correct.
Oh, inspector, I've often believed that it was he who drove Frederick mad.
- My God! You don't think he...?
- Mrs. Brandt.
Don't tell me what I am thinking.
Listen to what I'm saying.
- And please answer my questions.
- Inspector.
Now...
...in connection with other inquiries we're making...
...I would very much like to meet this Baron Frankenstein.
Or at least to discover what he looks like.
Now, do you know his whereabouts?
And did you ever meet him?
Mrs. Brandt, I am asking you, did you ever meet him?
Do you know where he is?
No... no.
Thank you, Mrs. Brandt.
I will keep you informed.
- You're late.
- I couldn't get away.
The police have been there all day.
They know he was taken.
They're pretty sure someone inside must have helped.
They're not utter fools.
Our friend is in trouble.
- He's had a very severe heart attack.
- I'm not surprised.
I massaged the heart. He won't live more than two or three days.
If I operate on him in his present condition, he'll die instantly.
Then it's all been a waste of time.
- It's over, isn't it?
- Not in the least.
Just made things more difficult.
But there's nothing you can do now.
On the contrary, I can transplant his brain.
If I don't, it'll die through lack of oxygen.
I must therefore transfer it to a healthy body to keep it alive.
When the recipient has fully recovered,
I shall operate again...
...to cure the insanity.
You can't mean any of that. You can't.
- I mean every word of it.
But that would mean you'd have to remove someone else's brain to do it.
Of course, Karl. How else?
But that would be murder!
You're used to that by now.
Aren't you?
Remember, Dr. Knox had Burke and Hare to assist him.
Think what they did for surgery between them.
Now, I have you.
If I were to put Dr. Brandt's brain in the body of another surgeon...
...he'd be the living proof of everything we were striving for.
Karl...
...Professor Richter would be ideal.
Anna!
It's me, Karl.
- Who is it, Karl?
- Anna!
- What are you doing out here?
- I came down for some fresh air.
- I saw the light on and I came...
- Go back to bed.
Go to bed, Anna!
You must get back to the asylum.
Everything's ready.
Help me carry him down first.
Come on.
Karl?
- Where's Karl?
- He's gone back to work...
...at the asylum.
We've done everything you asked.
Please leave my room.
Give me that key.
No!
No! No!
No!
No.
Gentlemen...
...Professor Richter has been forcibly removed from his home.
It happened last night.
Now, if I might be allowed to finish!
Thank you.
Now, I have reasons for believing that he is in very great danger.
I also have reasons for wishing that the matter receives no publicity in the press.
Now, if you cannot guarantee your cooperation...
...then I should be obliged to take out an enforcement order against your newspapers.
Now, I want no speculation on what the police may be doing.
And more important, I want no comment...
...on what, in fact, I am going to do.
Put the towels there.
Ready, Karl?
Concentrate.
Hold his head. Rigid.
Lower.
All right, same procedure as before.
Speed is essential.
Good night!
Quickly.
Utterly fantastic.
Not fantastic, Karl, advanced.
The transplanting of all human organs is a logical branch of surgery.
But you and your pigheaded contemporaries refuse to recognize the fact.
And now we must bury Brandt's body.
I shall be down for breakfast at 6:30, Anna.
I should like two lightly boiled eggs.
I don't know what they're looking for.
They've been to all the houses in my street.
The police, they're searching all the houses.
This one's a boarding house,
Miss Anna Spengler.
- Miss Spengler?
- Yes.
We have authority to search your premises.
May we come in?
- What are you looking for?
- Can't tell you that, miss.
- Please.
- Very well.
You've come at an awkward moment,
I'm afraid.
I'm having the hall redecorated.
You take the upstairs, you, Keller, take the garden.
- How many people staying here, miss?
- Only one.
A Mr. Fenner.
He's out at the moment.
I see.
I'll look around down here.
Dr. Holst?
Oh, Sergeant Brenner.
What are you fellows doing crawling all over the town?
Can't tell you that, sir.
Bit out of your line, isn't it?
Yes, it is a bit.
I've got a couple of days off.
I'm just helping out my fiancée.
Nothing out there, sergeant.
All right. Wait outside.
- Isn't there a cellar in this house, miss?
- A cellar? No, I don't have a cellar.
I have to put all the junk in the garden shed.
You can hardly get in it.
Nothing up there, sergeant.
Thank you.
He's a better doctor than he is a painter.
Yes, he's mending nicely.
The insanity was caused by pressure on the motor area of the brain.
That pressure must be removed.
And the cells that have been damaged must be destroyed.
Back.
Heart.
Hold his head.
This must be held still.
Absolutely still.
Right.
See to the dressings and bandage him.
In two days...
...I shall wake him just enough to elicit response.
If I'm satisfied...
...then for you it's all over.
He'll have to rest for a short time.
Then I shall take him away.
Ella, why don't you take a holiday?
But you've been under so much strain lately.
- A change would do you good.
- I couldn't.
Someone has taken my husband away.
I wouldn't have a moment's peace un...
Something wrong, Ella?
That man over there buying a buttonhole...
...I seem to know his face.
Hello, Anna. Lovely day.
I'm going shopping.
- Is there anything you want me to get?
- No, thank you very much.
My goodness! A main's burst.
I'll go to the Water Board and get some help.
They'll be here soon.
Anna! Anna, are you all right?
You look...
Go away!
For God's sake, go away!
Leave me alone!
I'll help you again, young lady.
- What happened?
- Oh, water main broke, sir.
- Devil of a mess, isn't it?
- Yes, it is indeed, sir.
It'll soon be done.
We've capped the hole.
It's happening all the time. Old pipes, you see.
- Ruined my plants.
There's nothing more to be seen here. I'm sure you have your own affairs to attend to. Excuse me.
Christina.
Look.
Well, I suppose it could be, Ella.
There's certainly a likeness.
Yes. Yes, it could be.
This will restore him to minimum consciousness.
I only want him to respond.
Can you hear me?
If you can, raise your hand.
Answer me each time by raising your hand.
You are Dr. Frederick Brandt, are you not?
I am Baron Frankenstein.
Do you remember the name?
Good evening.
Are you the owner of this house?
I am.
Could you tell me, is Baron Frankenstein staying here?
- There's no one here of that name.
- Please, don't close the door.
Well, you see, he might be using another name.
Please listen!
My name is Mrs. Frederick Brandt.
My dear Mrs. Brandt, how nice to meet you.
It was my intention to call on you, but you have saved me a journey. Please.
I am Baron Frankenstein.
I beg you not to be afraid.
- Your husband is here.
- Here?
Yes, and he is safe.
You will see him shortly.
I'm sorry I had to take matters into my own hands, but I had no choice.
It was the only way I could save him.
Save him? What do you mean?
- Where is he?
- Now, please, let me explain.
Had I come to you and asked for your permission...
...to have him removed from the asylum and put under my care...
...I do not think you would have granted it.
And under the circumstances, that would have been understandable.
But once I discovered where he was,
I could not leave him there...
...when I knew it was in my power to help him.
Help him?
When it was you who drove him out of his mind.
Even now, you can't leave him in peace.
Where is he?
What have you done to him?
He is downstairs. He is sane.
- Sane?
- Come, let me show you.
Please don't be frightened at what you see.
The apparatus is merely a method of feeding him...
...until he is capable of taking nourishment in the normal way.
- God, what have you done to him?
- He is simply asleep. Asleep and sane.
- He is cured.
- But that's impossible.
- Mrs. Brandt.
- What have you done to him?
Do you think I'd allow you to see this if I were not telling the truth?
Let me go!
Oh, help me! In the name of God, somebody help me!
There is no one in the world who can help you, except me.
And that I have done.
What did they tell you at the asylum about your husband's condition?
- They said there was no hope for him.
- Yes, and they are the very same people...
...who said your husband and I were evil...
...because they didn't understand what we were doing.
They did not wish to understand, and so they condemned us both.
They pilloried your husband...
...and declared to the world that he was mad.
And at last, they drove him mad.
Now, when he was ill, how much did he remember?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
His whole past life had disappeared.
Come with me. Please.
Watch his left hand.
Use your left hand to answer me.
You are Dr. Frederick Brandt?
- Why is he covered? May I not see him?
- Not yet.
The scars of his operation have not healed.
I'd rather you waited until they have.
Your Christian name is Ella, I believe.
Brandt, your wife's name is Lily, isn't it?
Is it Ella?
Is your wife's name Ella?
He's just on the edge of consciousness and cannot speak.
Ask him any question you wish very softly...
...and watch his left hand.
Frederick, do you recognize this voice?
Is it the voice of your wife?
The color of my hair...
...is it black?
Auburn, then?
That's enough, Mrs. Brandt.
We mustn't tire him.
- How? How?
- How is not important.
What is important is that you never speak of this to anyone.
I have seriously broken the law.
He must have complete rest for a whole week.
You can come visit him anytime, if you so wish.
And at the end of a week, you can take him away...
...and start a new life together.
You helped, Dr. Holst?
Thank you.
Thank you.
- What can I say to you?
- Nothing needs to be said.
Remember, don't mention this to anyone.
Goodbye, Mrs. Brandt, and please don't worry. There's no cause.
Pack. We're leaving.
Straight on, then turn right at the next crossroads.
I must have been out of my mind not to come to you at once.
That was very stupid of you, Mrs. Brandt.
- You say that he recognized you?
- He knew his name.
He knew my name.
He knew the color of my hair.
Inspector, up here, quickly.
No!
No! No!
No! No!
What are we going to do, Karl?
They'll be coming for us soon, won't they?
What is it, Karl?
Stay here.
It won't be long before the police discover where we are, old friend.
So you and I must have our little talk sooner than I anticipated.
One hour.
And we shall talk of things long overdue.
- What's happened, Karl?
- No questions, Anna.
I want you to go to the stables, harness the horses and stay there.
But, Karl, I can't. I don't know how.
He's waking Richter tonight.
He'll discover what he wants and leave without us.
And without that carriage, we can't get anywhere.
Anna, by Richter's right hand there's a tray with a hypodermic and a file in it.
I must have them.
When I say, "Why don't you get some rest, Anna"...
...I want you to get them and bring them to me in the stable.
But what do you want them for?
I'll know from the amount used what time he's waking.
When Frankenstein goes downstairs, we take the carriage.
I'd like some coffee, Anna.
- How much longer must we stay here?
- A few days yet.
Well, I think I'll try to get some sleep.
Why don't you have a rest, Anna?
What time in the morning?
Seven. Sharp.
No.
Please.
I mean you no harm.
Frankenstein...
...where is he?
What are you doing, Karl?
What happened?
What have you done to him?
What have you done to him?!
He was awake.
- I stabbed him.
- You...?
No.
No.
Anna.
Anna.
I had to come here, Ella.
I had nowhere else to go.
The letter was the only way of introducing myself to you.
For God's sake, who are you?
I buried my husband days ago.
Who are you to contemplate such a dreadful joke?
I am your husband, Ella.
You'll not recognize my voice...
...because it is the voice of a different person.
No.
No. Who are you?
You asked me, did I recognize your voice...
...and what was the color of your hair?
And I answered by raising my left hand.
I have become the victim of...
...everything that Frankenstein and I ever advocated.
My brain...
...is in someone else's body.
I cannot leave here, Ella.
There's nowhere else for me to go.
Frankenstein will know I could only come here, and soon he will come for me.
I know why he did this.
I must have been at some point where I was very close to death.
He had to keep my brain alive.
He wants the formula...
...that I was going to give him.
I cannot risk your going to the police before he arrives.
I will release you when the time is right.
I didn't want you to see me, Ella.
Please.
- Don't be afraid.
- Don't touch me.
I wouldn't harm you, Ella.
I'm your husband.
Don't say that.
You're not...
You're not anything human.
You'd kill me?
Yes, I'd kill you.
I've been driven almost insane.
Why have you come here? Why?
For revenge.
Do I not deserve revenge?
You may leave now.
Go by the back staircase, and move quietly.
I fancy...
...that I am the spider and you are the fly, Frankenstein.
I know why you did this.
And what you've come for.
Brandt, our work.
Our research, remember?
We must continue together.
Better you had killed me.
That would be my wife on her way to the police.
What you want is on a desk in my study.
The game is for you to try and get it.
Wrong door.
You must choose...
...between the flames and the police,
Frankenstein.
You haven't got long to get those papers.
Only one door left, Frankenstein.
No! Brandt, no!
No! Brandt!
No! Brandt! No!
No! Brandt!
No! Brandt! No!
Some 200 years ago...
a beggar came to the little town of Santa Vera...
in search of charity.
Although a simple man...
he was not so simple that he did not know...
when it was a weekday and when it was Sunday.
And although the church bell was sounding...
and all the little shops were closed...
and there was no one in the square, he knew...
this was not a Sunday.
Señor.
Forgive a poor ignorant beggar, señor... but today is not Sunday.
They're ringing the bells and... there is no one in the streets.
Can't you read?
No, señor.
Well?
Señor. Today is not Sunday.
I am aware of that.
There is no one in the street.
I'm aware of that, too.
And the church bell is ringing.
And you want to know why, is that it?
Yes.
Well, I'll tell you why.
Today is a holiday.
A public holiday.
A day of rejoicing.
And we're all rejoicing today, aren't we, señores?
Do you know why we're rejoicing?
Because our beloved Marques is getting married today... and we have to rejoice.
By order.
By order.
Landlord, get me a drink.
Isn't that a good thing?
And who will have to pay for this wedding?
We shall.
And who's paid for the bride, poor child? We have.
Yeah.
Who's paying for that feast that's going on... at this very moment up at the castle?
We are.
I haven't seen you here before.
What are you, a beggar?
Yes, señor.
If, from the deep charity of your good heart...
We've nothing to spare, my friend.
That's where all our charity has gone.
Yeah.
If you want some of it, you'd better go there.
And God knows,
I wish you luck.
The beggar took the man at his word...
and climbed the long road to the castle...
where, as he had been told...
the Marques was celebrating his wedding day with a feast.
Stop.
What's the matter, my dear?
It... it looks so...
Don't you like goose?
Why have you prepared goose... when the Marquesa doesn't like goose?
My lord, I didn't know.
Oh, why didn't you know?
Why didn't you know?
Have mercy, my lord.
Pick it up.
Well?
If, from the deep charity of your noble master's heart...
Go away, man, before he sees you.
Who is it?
No one, my lord.
Just a beggar.
Well, bring him in.
Welcome.
I'm afraid you were so late that we started without you.
Noble lord.
If, from the deep charity of your good heart...
If only you'd let us know.
If you could spare a little bread...
A little earlier... a whole goose would have been yours.
But now, as you see, everything's gone.
Not a crumb left.
Don't tease him.
Why not, my dear?
He's a man, not an animal.
Oh, is he?
Yes, I suppose he is.
Would you like to have him, my dear...
As a pet?
How much do you want for yourself?
Two pesetas? Five? Ten?
Ten pesetas, my lord?
Done.
Now, he's yours, my dear, your very own pet.
What would you like him to do?
Give him some food and wine.
Excellent.
Wine for our new guest.
And food.
Later.
Wine, wine.
More.
Not in that piddling cup.
Here, fill this.
Yeah. Go on, give him more.
Uh-uh.
Food. I must have food.
Oh!
You must sing for it first.
Yeah.
Come on, sing, sing.
I can't sing.
Dance, then.
I can't dance.
Anyone can dance. Music.
Dance.
Dance.
Please.
Give him something to eat.
Here, dog.
Here's your bone.
Come on, come and get it like a good dog.
Time for us to retire, my dear.
My bride and I bid you goodnight.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Thank you, señor.
Have a good night.
You insolent...
Don't forget, he's mine.
A wedding gift from my husband.
I don't want my gift to be damaged.
You're quite right, my dear.
He must be looked after.
You, see he's looked after.
And so the beggar was imprisoned...
in the castle dungeon.
Time passed.
And he was forgotten.
The only people he ever saw...
were the jailor and his little girl...
a serious child who could not speak.
Here, you give it to him.
He's your friend.
The years passed.
And the beggar remained a prisoner.
Now, completely forgotten by the Marques.
The old jailor died.
His daughter grew up.
But still, she could not speak.
The vile temper and foul tongue of the Marques...
had sent his wife to an early grave.
And lost him the few friends he possessed.
Now he lives a recluse in his own rooms.
And what's your name, my dear?
Don't be frightened.
Just tell me your name.
Your name, my dear.
Your name. Your name.
Ah! No, you don't.
You are a lively one, aren't you?
Why don't you show me just how lively you can be?
You come here tonight and show me, huh.
The little vixen.
I'll show her.
Who was that girl?
My lord?
The one that just went out, idiot.
Just a servant, my lord.
Used to work below, my lord, in the dungeons.
Used to work below, did she?
In the dungeons, huh?
You're to stay there until you've learnt your manners.
And to be a bit friendlier.
Come to your senses, have you?
Somehow,
I thought you would.
You know where you got to go now, don't you?
Who is it?
My dear.
The girl hid in the forest for some months...
where she lived like an animal.
It was here that I found her.
There. That didn't take long, did it, señor?
This will soon put some color... back into her cheeks, poor mite.
Fancy you finding her like that.
The angels were certainly watching over her.
You should take some of this before you catch a chill... getting yourself all wet like that.
Well,
I suppose if you hadn't... she would still have been lying there.
Instead of tucked up snug in your spare bed.
I'll make some for you when I come down.
Do you much more good than that stuff.
It's a lucky thing she didn't lose her baby.
Her baby?
Here you are, my little one.
Drink this.
It'll soon put you to rights.
No. Now don't try to speak.
Just take a sip or two of this.
And you can go back to sleep again.
That's a good girl.
A little more.
Good.
There.
Now you go right back to sleep and let my herbs... soothe away your aches and pains.
What did you say about...
Shh.
A baby?
In a few months there'll be a little baby in the house... if the good Lord spares her.
What's your name, my little one?
Oh, come now, you needn't be shy with me.
You haven't spoken a word since you've been here.
Nobody is going to hurt you.
Now tell me, what's your name?
Oh, my poor child.
You poor little thing.
You poor lonely little thing.
Teresa's new interest...
gave me the peace
I needed for my work.
At least, it did, at first.
Here's your nightcap, señor.
Leave it there, Teresa.
Señor, I'm beginning to be a bit worried.
What about?
Of course, you may think me superstitious.
I think...
You may think me superstitious, but...
I've seen a good deal more of the world than you have.
The real world, not what you read about in your old books.
You know, it will soon be the 25th.
25th?
Of December.
You know what that means.
The 25th is always on Christmas Day.
Well, then? Christmas Day is always on the 25th.
Of course, if you're going to make fun of me...
No, I am not making fun of you.
I don't understand.
What's the matter?
What's worrying you?
What worries me is that the girl upstairs is about to have her baby.
And as like as not... it will be born on the very hour of our Lord's birth.
Surely that should be a reason to rejoice?
For an unwanted child to be born then...
is an insult to heaven, señor.
That's what I was taught.
In the village where I come from... the girls stay away from the men in March and April... just in case.
Let's pray the little child is born too soon.
Or too late.
Otherwise...
Don't worry.
We'll have it born exactly to suit you.
Oh.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Hello, what's this, then?
Nasty, that is.
Very nasty.
Dominique, you lost any goats?
No.
Why?
There's a dead one up here with his throat torn out.
Very nasty.
That dog of yours been behaving itself?
Now, listen... if there's a dead goat up there... with its throat torn, it can't be him.
It'll be a wolf.
A wolf, eh?
Yes.
And you're paid by us... to keep things like wolves away.
A wolf, eh?
Hello, Pepe.
Where are you off to so early in the morning?
Uh, got to see the mayor.
Got to report a dead goat.
While you're about it, you better report a dead kitten.
Kitten?
Yes, I found a kitten dead in my garden this morning.
Horrible state it was in.
Throat torn out.
Oh.
Little Leon's kitten, too.
It'll break his heart when he finds out.
Yeah.
I think there's been a wolf about.
Well, whatever it was, it certainly made a mess of that kitten.
I didn't dare let the little fellow see it.
No.
No. He can't stand the sight of blood, can he?
No.
I remember the day he came hunting with me.
Nearly fainted when I shot a squirrel.
Cried his little heart out.
Well, I better not keep the mayor waiting.
Goodbye, Pepe.
Oh, there you are, Leon.
Ready for your breakfast, my angel?
I'm not hungry,
Aunt Teresa.
Oh, no lunch yesterday, and hardly any supper last night.
This won't do.
Come, I've made some of my hotcakes for you.
You like those, don't you?
You seem to be falling down on your job, Pepe.
You're employed as a watchman... not to loaf about all day, letting a pack of wolves come up to the town... stealing our goats from under our noses.
But I've always tried...
If it hadn't been for Dominique here, the goats might never have been discovered.
But it was I who...
However, I have no wish to be unduly harsh.
I'll overlook it this time.
Now get on with your job.
I want those wolves dead within 24 hours and... delivered to me here at the town hall, do you understand?
Yes, señor.
24 hours.
Not a minute more.
You may go.
There, rest quietly.
You'll soon be better now.
Try to sleep, my little one.
I did shoot it, I tell you.
It was a young wolf.
I saw it and I shot it.
Where is it now?
Disappeared into thin air,
I suppose?
Yes.
I lost three goats last night. And I lost two.
I can't help it if things won't die when I shoot them.
Want to get yourself a new gun... or a pair of spectacles.
Or stick to water.
Come on, let's report this to the town hall.
I did shoot it.
I did.
He must have got up during the night.
It's the only explanation.
He must have got up... come downstairs... and gone out.
But if he'd come through here,
I'd have heard him.
You'd be asleep.
I'd have woken up.
He never came down those stairs.
You mean he climbed out of the window?
I just mean he didn't come through here.
Oh.
There's only one way of finding out.
Now.
I want you to tell me everything, Leon. Promise?
I promise.
And truthfully.
Yes.
Where did you go last night?
Go, Uncle?
Yes.
I know you went out.
Where did you go?
I was in bed all night,
Uncle.
Oh, Leon, you promised to tell me the truth.
I am telling the truth.
Then how did you get hurt?
I don't know, Uncle.
You couldn't have been hurt like that in bed.
I know I was in bed, Uncle... because I woke up in the night.
I had a bad dream and woke up... but then I went to sleep again.
What did you dream?
I don't really remember,
Uncle... not very clearly.
But it was like the other nights.
Other nights?
I have bad dreams every night now, Uncle.
I see.
Tell me, Leon, when did these dreams start?
I think it was after
I went out hunting... with old Pepe.
He wanted to show me how to shoot.
He wanted me to shoot a squirrel, but I wouldn't.
So he shot it for me.
He pulled the trigger... and the little squirrel squeaked and dropped.
It was horrible.
I picked it up and tried to kiss it better.
I kissed it, and I tasted something warm.
It must have been the blood, but it tasted sweet.
I wanted to keep on tasting it, but Pepe took it away.
I did wrong, didn't I, Uncle?
No, no,
I don't think so, Leon.
Ever since then
I've had bad dreams, Uncle.
What do you dream?
I dream I'm a wolf, like in a picture book.
I dream I'm a wolf, drinking blood.
Help me, Uncle.
Please help me.
Yes, I'll help you.
Yes, it's one of his, all right.
Where did you find it,
Teresa?
I-it was embedded in a tree trunk up near the pastures.
Oh, so he did miss.
I won't breathe a word about it.
Ah, thank you, Teresa.
It would break his heart.
He's been so upset as it is.
Will you have a glass of something?
No, thank you. I must go.
There are elemental spirits about us... at all times, my son.
Spirits without bodies... of creatures that have never lived.
Some say it is to prevent the invasion... of these roaming spirits... into the highest creation of God's sculpturing hands... the body of man... before whom all beasts must kneel.
Some say it is to prevent this invasion that... man's body stiffens into rigor mortis... at the moment of his death.
Roaming spirit entering the body then finds only a... dry, unwelcoming shell.
But, Father...
And you're wondering... what this has to do with little Leon?
Yes.
I'll tell you, my son.
Sometimes, it so happens that... the spirits of one of these beasts... finds entrance into a body... while it yet lives.
Usually at the moment of birth.
Then, the soul and the spirit war with each other... to gain mastery of the body.
But if the soul of the man is strong and clean... we'll generally exorcize the spirit of the beast... before it is many years old, but... if for some reason, the soul is weak... an inherited weakness... an accident of birth, then...
I see.
A werewolf.
That is what he is, my son.
A werewolf is a body with a soul and a spirit that are constantly at war.
The spirit is that of a wolf.
And whatever weakens the human soul... vice, greed, hatred, solitude... especially during the cycle of the full moon... when the forces of evil are at their strongest.
These bring the spirit of the wolf to the fore.
And in turn... whatever weakens the spirit of the beast... warmth, fellowship, love... raise the human soul.
Now... little Leon has no real father or mother.
And yet he needs their love and care far more than any normal child.
I understand, Father.
And I shall do my best to replace that love.
I know you will, my son.
But is there no cure?
Only love.
When he is older... he may meet a young girl... whom he will love very deeply.
But what is more important... she should love him very deeply.
Then he may be saved.
It was no ordinary wolf... gentlemen.
No ordinary wolf... would tear out the throat... and drain blood.
Drain blood?
Every last drop.
Well, if it wasn't a wolf, what was it?
Last night... was the night of the full moon.
And do you know what that means?
What?
Here.
Who's going to pay for all these drinks?
Give it to him.
It means that... things are abroad.
Things?
What sort of things?
Strange things... that should not be spoken of.
Good day, señor, señora.
Well, whatever it is out there... my husband will get rid of it.
Won't you, my dear?
Just gonna give this a clean.
Ah.
That should keep your nightmares away.
Yes, Uncle.
I'll have a wolf steak and potato.
Now, listen all of you.
I've had just about enough of this.
If any one of you makes another insulting remark... about my good husband... he goes out of that door.
I hit that animal, fair and square.
Must be dead. I...
Pepe, you might have lent me a hand.
Oh, what's happened to my crucifix?
I had to do it.
It was the only way.
But that crucifix was blessed by the Archbishop himself.
So much the better, my dear.
Leon.
Leon.
So it was you all the time.
Leon grew into a fine lad...
and the care and affection that Teresa and I gave him...
seemed to cure him completely of his terrible sickness.
Now, if you don't like the place, you come straight back.
Promise?
I promise.
Why you can't stay here and work with your father, I don't know.
Now, Teresa, it's only natural he should want to make his own way in the world.
I admire him for it.
Thank you, Father.
Oh, but working in the vineyard...
Oh, Teresa.
Goodbye, Father.
Goodbye, my boy.
Oh, your money, have you got your money safe?
It's here, Aunt Teresa.
Well, Teresa?
We must thank God, señor.
He has given
Leon back to us.
Who are you?
Oh, I'm Leon Carido.
Señor.
Señor.
Are you strong?
Oh, yes.
You look strong.
Do you like work?
Yes.
When I'm paid for it, señor.
You better come in.
This is where you'll work.
The hours are 7:00 to 10:00, with a half hour for lunch.
And the pay's six pesetas.
You sleep in there.
Jose here will tell you what to do.
My name's Leon.
You heard mine all ready.
Jose. Welcome.
He, uh, said you'd tell me what I had to do.
Oh, it's easy.
There's the wine, you see?
Red in there, white in there.
There's the bottles... and there's the labels.
You put the wine inside.
You put the labels outside.
Who's that?
Well, uh,
The old misery is
Don Fernando, but you know that already, don't you?
Uh, the young misery is young Gomez... his father owns this place.
And, uh, the pretty one... the one you really want to know about.
That's Fernando's daughter.
And to start you asking your next question, they're engaged.
That makes Daddy Fernando very happy.
Does it make her happy?
Well, what do you think?
I mean, just look at him.
Drive on.
Wave, child, wave.
Really, Cristina, I think you might try and be more gracious to your future husband.
She's coming this way.
Well, it's not to see you.
So don't get yourself excited.
I've, um, come to apologize, señor.
Apologize?
It was you we splashed, wasn't it?
With the carriage?
There's no need for you to apologize, señorita.
If I don't,
I'm sure no one else will.
My name is Cristina Fernando.
Señorita.
And you?
Leon.
Leon Carido. I've, uh, just started work here.
I know. I, um, hope you'll be happy here.
Thank you. I'm sure I shall.
Yes,
I'm sure you will, too.
It's very unfair.
This is the third evening running you've had a headache... and we've had to come home early.
I can't help having headaches, Rico.
No, but it's beastly inconvenient, all the same.
And I was winning, too.
100 pesetas,
I stood to win...
If it's the money...
No, it's not the money.
What is it, then?
Well, it-it's very unfair, that's what it is.
Hey.
Look.
Oh, well.
Wish you were real, darling.
In the absence of anything better to do...
I'm for bed.
Don't wear your eyes out. And don't use up all that candle.
I've got better things to spend my money on.
Hey, talking about money, you know what tomorrow is, don't you?
It's Saturday.
We must celebrate.
Celebrate?
It's payday.
Music and dancing.
Don't forget that candle.
Good night, Rico.
Thank you.
Good night.
Is that you, Cristina?
Yes, Papa.
You're back early.
Enjoy yourself?
Yes, Papa.
Good. Straight to bed, now.
Yes, Papa.
Oh, I thought you were never coming.
I thought I'd never get here.
This is just a dream.
No, no, this is real, Cristina.
What if my father finds out?
Come away with me, Cristina.
If it were only as simple as that.
I love you.
I know.
I want you to marry me.
I can't, I can't, you know that.
It's all been arranged for me.
I'm to marry Rico Gomez.
Marry me, Cristina.
Oh, my father would never let me.
I'll speak to him.
Let me speak to your father.
Oh, you mustn't.
Promise me you won't?
He'd send you away.
We'd never see each other again.
He'd see to that...
Anybody there?
He must have heard us.
Tomorrow?
I can't tomorrow.
Sunday, then?
Sunday.
I've never heard anything so ridiculous in my whole life.
Staying in on your own on Saturday night.
Pay night.
It's unthinkable.
In fact, come to think of it, it's downright immoral.
All right. I give in.
Now, that's better.
Where do we go?
Oh, do you like good food, wine... fine music, wonderful dancing, and... beautiful girls?
There's this place I know, just outside town.
It's quiet, mind, very respectable.
You all right?
What's the matter, dear?
You are not feeling very well.
Why don't you get some fresh air? Come on.
Go out on the terrace.
Wishing on the moon?
Did I make you jump? Sorry.
Anyway, it's a new moon you wish on, isn't it?
What?
You are slow, aren't you?
Don't you feel very well?
No.
No, I don't.
What you need is a little lie down.
You can come up to my room, if you like.
Oh, don't worry about her in there.
We can slip up the back way.
Your friend wasn't feeling very well.
He's gone for some fresh air.
Oh, doesn't he look pretty?
Charming.
Waiter, more wine.
You don't care what you spend, do you?
Money is no object, my dear.
Bravo.
This will make you feel better.
Not very talkative are you, dear?
Still...
I like a man who doesn't chatter.
I get enough of that from the other girls.
Here... why don't I make you more comfortable?
There.
That's better, isn't it?
What's the matter, dear?
Worrying about your girlfriend downstairs?
She won't miss you, dear.
Not for just a few minutes.
You all right, dear?
Careful.
Here.
What's the idea?
If that's what you came for, you came to the wrong place.
I've a good mind to...
How much longer does your friend expect me to sit here by myself?
I shall personally supervise his immediate return, my dear.
Don't speak to any strange men.
Really.
Leon?
Leon, where are you, my little friend?
Leon?
Come on.
Every night for the past 13 years... you've been on about that dog of yours.
Now keep quiet about it.
I've had enough.
The best dog that I ever had.
You had to shoot him.
Yes, I had to shoot him.
He was a killer, that's why.
He keeps the bullet around his neck to remind him, round his neck.
I keep the bullet around my neck because it's made of real silver.
The best dog I ever had.
Ah, go home.
Leon?
Leon? Leon?
Leon?
In God's name, what happened?
Your clothes, you...
You can't...
No! No! No!
It's the truth, my son.
I won't believe you.
I can't.
There, there.
Leon?
I must ask you once again.
Can you remember anything you did?
Where you went to last night?
No.
But try, please try.
I can't, I tell you.
I can't remember anything.
The blood.
There was blood on my hands.
Where did I get blood on my hands?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Perhaps it's the blood of some animal.
A sheep, maybe.
You mean,
I killed it with...
With...
There, there.
You knew about this all the time, Father?
But you didn't tell anyone?
Thank you.
What am I going to do?
Tell me, what am I going to do, Father?
I think I can obtain permission for you to enter a monastery... under special supervision.
But... until then you must be... chained, and watched night and day.
Oh, yes, that's right, isn't it?
You chain up wild animals.
That's all I am. An animal.
Hey, you.
Sargento.
Why, that's him.
Are you Leon Carido?
Yes.
A friend of
Jose Amadayo?
Yes.
I understand that you were both at a certain establishment last night.
Owned by a Señora Zumara?
Yes.
According to a Señorita
Yvonne, you left early.
Is that right?
Yes, yes, I think so.
You think so?
Well,
I had a lot to drink.
Where did you go then,
Señor Carido?
Home.
Home?
Are you sure?
Yes, I've just left there.
You just left there?
I see.
Why... Why are you asking me these questions?
Just making some inquiries.
Good day, señor.
Good day.
Señor.
Well, I hope you feel ashamed of yourself.
Señor?
Going to a place like that.
Getting drunk. Disgusting.
Don Fernando?
Tell me.
Has anything happened to Jose?
I neither know nor care.
Probably in jail.
You're very fortunate that you're not there with him.
Help me.
Leon?
Get away! Get away!
Get away!
Leon, what's wrong?
No.
Get away.
Leon?
Leon?
I must go.
Before father finds out
I've been with you all night.
All night?
All night.
Careful.
You've been here with me all night?
Yes.
Tell me, I must know.
Did... Did anything happen to me?
You hurt your leg.
You were frightened and screaming...
No. No.
Did I change?
Did my face change?
My hands.
Did anything happen?
No, Leon.
You have saved me.
Oh, God, thank you for sending her to me.
We must go away.
Now, today.
You must marry me, and we must go away.
Leon.
We'll start a new life.
A wonderful life, Cristina.
We'll be together every minute of the day and night.
Tell me what's wrong.
Cristina... do you love me?
Will you marry me, Cristina?
You say you love me, will you marry me?
Yes. Yes, I will.
My darling, this is terribly important.
But you must trust me until I have time to explain better.
We must go away. Now. Today.
Please don't ask anymore questions.
Will you come?
Yes.
Yes, I'll come with you.
Are these your clothes, señor?
Yes.
Leon Carido, I must ask you to accompany me.
But why?
I'm arresting you on a charge of murder.
In God's name, listen to me, will you?
You must send for my father.
You must, don't you understand? You must!
Listen to me,
I tell you! Listen!
My boy... there is only one thing he'll listen to.
Look, I'll pay you.
I'm willing to pay you.
What do you want, señor?
I want you to send somebody...
to fetch my father,
Señor Don Alfredo Carido.
How can I possibly leave here?
Must be somebody you can send.
Well, there is.
Send somebody to tell him I'm here.
I need him.
Señor Don Alfredo Carido.
He lives at the outside of the square.
The big house at the top of the steps.
Well? What do you wait...
Here. Now, hurry, please.
Leon?
Leon, where are you?
Leon?
You all right?
What do you think you're doing?
Where were you going?
Come on, where were you going?
You were going with him, weren't you?
You were going to run away with him, weren't you?
Oh, I say.
You were, weren't you?
Yes, I was.
What?
And I still am.
You ungrateful little...
Where is he, Father?
Please, where is he?
He is right where he deserves to be.
Where is he?
I must go to him, Father, he needs me.
Needs you?
I'll bet he does, the debauched young...
Will you please tell me where he is?
He's in jail.
That's where he is.
Prison?
Yes, prison.
Why? What for?
What do they say he's done?
I'm not interested in what he's done.
I just know they have taken him away.
And good riddance.
Rico... will you please take me to him? What?
I want you to take me to the town.
I shall do no such thing.
Well, then, will you lend me your carriage? What's that?
Certainly not.
Then I shall have to take it.
Cristina?
Come back here at once.
Come back.
You're to drive me to the town.
It's an order from Señor Gomez.
And hurry, please.
Cristina? Come back.
I have already killed three people,
Father. Can't you understand this?
Strangled them with my hands.
Savaged them with my teeth.
That has yet to be proved.
Proof.
They'll prove it, all right, because it's true.
And if they make me stay here tonight, it's going to happen all over again.
Don't think these are going to stop me.
What can we do?
We must go to the mayor.
Appeal to him.
No, not appeal.
Tell him... tell him what I am.
Tell him I have confessed to everything. What?
Tell him I have confessed.
That you must have me executed.
Now.
My son...
Yes, now. Before sunset.
And, Father, you must tell him how it must be done.
Burned.
Burned...
Burned alive.
No, this is too much.
It's preposterous.
It's too much to expect me to believe.
Nevertheless, it is true.
How long have you known of this, Father?
Since he was a child.
And you did nothing about it?
I wasn't certain.
Then why are you certain now? Why?
You have only to ask my son, and he will tell you.
Your son, a murderer.
Yes.
What is it you want me to do, then?
Please, hand the boy over to me, so that I may take him to a monastery... where he'll be looked after.
No. That's impossible.
No, the boy will have to stand trial.
If he is kept in this town until after sunset, he can't be responsible for his actions.
What do you mean? I mean that he'll break out of prison and kill.
Kill wantonly and savagely.
Like an animal.
And you... you will be responsible.
There he is, señor, that's the one.
You there. Stand up.
Let me look at you.
Let me see your hands.
Now your teeth.
Open your mouth.
Come on.
Señor, I beseech you.
Don't make me stay here.
Now, I shall require other witnesses.
There's Teresa.
Teresa?
Yes, my servant.
Your servant?
I'm afraid I cannot...
Let me in. Let me in.
Let me in.
Cristina.
Silence!
You must let her in. She can help me. She's the only one.
I wish to see Leon Carido.
Leon.
Señorita.
What are they doing to you?
Help me, Cristina.
Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Cristina Fernando, señor.
You know the prisoner?
Yes, señor.
Well?
We are engaged to be married, señor.
You are engaged to be married, are you?
So you know all about him?
Señor?
You know all about his affliction.
Affliction?
So far as you know, this is a perfectly normal young man?
Yes.
Thank you.
The prisoner will remain here and stand trial.
Gentlemen.
Come, my child.
Leave her with me.
For God's sake, have pity.
Leave her.
Come. Come.
Please my child, come.
What are they doing?
What's happening?
Father, the bullet.
Pepe the watchman has a silver bullet.
Get it and use it.
Use it on me, Father.
You must use it, do you hear?
You must use it. You must!
I don't believe you.
But you must, my child.
It's the truth.
It's not true.
It's not true.
Please tell me it's not true.
It's getting dark.
Pepe?
Pepe?
Pepe Valiente.
Hey.
It's a beautiful evening.
The moon is just rising.
The full moon.
It will soon be as bright as day.
Ah, Teresa... this young lady has nowhere to stay.
She is a friend of Leon's... and I thought, perhaps...
Come in, my dear.
Well, I must go back to the church.
I will come here after service.
My dear, you're shivering.
Come and sit by the fire, and I'll get you a warm drink.
Leon.
Guard! Guard!
This will soon put some color into your cheeks.
I can't think where
Don Alfredo has got to.
There was something about a silver bullet.
Pepe's silver bullet.
So, it's come to that at last.
Come to what?
What is this bullet?
A silver bullet... made from... a crucifix.
The only bullet that will kill... a werewolf.
What is it?
What happened?
What you said.
Where is he?
I don't know, señor.
There he is, up on the roof.
Did you see anything?
No, what's happening?
There he is.
Surround the house.
Just guard it.
That's it, guard it.
You stay here.
I know how to get him down from there.
Another day to live through, better get started.
December, 1965.
Is that all it has been since
I inherited the world?
Only three years.
It seems like a hundred million.
Yeah, I own the world.
An empty, dead, silent world.
More of them for the pit.
Every day there are more of them.
They live off the weak ones and leave them for the pit.
K-O-K-W calling. Come in.
K-O-K-W calling.
I'm on international frequency. Come in.
They can't bear to see their image.
It repels them.
I need more mirrors.
And this garlic's lost its pungency.
There was a time when eating was pleasurable.
Now it bores me. Just fuel for survival.
I'll settle for coffee and orange juice this morning.
But first there is my life to consider.
I'd better replace that garlic.
I need more, lots more.
Better stop off and get them.
I can't afford the luxury of anger.
Anger can make me vulnerable.
It can destroy my reason, and reason is the only advantage I have over them.
I've got to find where they hide during the day.
Uncover every one of them.
Now, where did I finish off yesterday?
Madison Street to 31st Avenue.
Eleven kills over three years.
And there's more than half the city I haven't searched.
They're perfect.
Just wide enough to keep the flesh apart so their body seal can't function.
How many more of these will I have to make... before they're all destroyed?
They want my blood, it's their lives or mine.
But, I still get squeamish.
Wait... that garlic.
I'd better put it back where it belongs.
I can't live a heartbeat away from hell and forget it.
I'm out of gas. That means one more stop I'll have to make.
I can get rid of them later.
Right now, I'm out of gas.
They're still fresh.
But I'll take only what I need.
They've got to last.
They can wait too.
I've got my life to worry about.
Those mirrors have to be replaced before dark.
Square blocks to search.
How many of them still exist?
How long will I have to keep up this search?
I haven't much time left.
It'll be dark in an hour.
And now 12 long hours before the sun will rise... and drive them back to darkness.
Morgan, come out.
Come out.
Morgan, come out. Come out.
Robert, help me!
Another day.
Another day to start all over again.
Virge.
Virge.
God, how I miss you.
The sun's already set. They'll be everywhere!
It's Morgan. Get him!
Do you hear?
Morgan.
Do you hear, Morgan?
Morgan.
Do you hear, Morgan?
Three years.
Three years.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Hey, Virge? Virge?
Yes? Oh, no! My makeup. My hair!
Hey, where is everybody?
- All I can see is...
- Hi, Ben!
I can hear children, but I can't see any children.
Uncle Ben!
Uncle Ben!
Look at Uncle Ben!
Ben! Uncle Ben! Uncle Ben!
- What did you bring me?
- Open them and see.
- Come. Come.
- Go on and open them Kathy.
Take a look at this.
- It's highly theoretical, Ben.
- Theoretical?
Do I have to remind you that theory is the beginning of solution?
"Is Europe's disease carried on the wind?" Is it, Ben?
- It could be.
- And if it is?
It isn't, Virge.
Is that what you really think, or just what you'd like to think?
I cannot accept half-baked theories that sell newspapers.
I'm a scientist, not an alarmist.
You're whistling past the graveyard.
Is that a commentary on my work at the lab?
- We both know how hard you've worked.
- I'm sorry, Ben.
I just can't accept the idea of universal disease.
Uncle Ben, you promised us card tricks.
All right, Kathy. Who can resist that face?
All right. Card tricks. Card tricks.
Robert...
Is it possible this germ, or virus, could be airborne?
Anything is possible, Virge.
The best brains in the world have been running through this thing... with a fine-toothed comb.
The germ is visible under a microscope... but it's not like any bacilli
I've ever known.
In what way?
It can't be destroyed by any process we've been able to uncover.
But with the whole world trying, there must be a solution.
Mommy, when are we gonna cut the cake?
Right now our problem is to cut that cake.
- Hey, Mommy. Mommy!
- Coming. Coming.
The wind wake you up?
It always does.
- How do you feel?
- I'm all right.
- Don't get up, honey.
- I'm not sick, Bob.
- I'll make your breakfast.
- You don't have to.
I'll be all right. Go on and read your paper.
All right.
Sweetheart, look, if you don't feel well, please go back to bed.
I'm just a little tired, that's all.
I wish somebody would find a vaccine.
It's all we're working on at the lab, Virge.
Maybe you better not send her to school today.
All right.
- Do you think you should go to work?
- I have to.
Bob?
Bob, I'm so frightened.
Everything's going to be all right, sweetheart.
- Well?
- The bacilli are multiplying.
That kicks the bone marrow theory in the head.
This specimen shows a higher white count... than when I put it on the slide.
Those cells are still living,
Dr. Mercer, off one another.
There has to be an answer.
You've heard that all communications are ended outside the continental limits?
Yes, I heard.
That leaves it in our laps.
So we keep trying. Where's Cortman?
Well, he should be here by now.
You two stay on this virus theory until I decide it's exhausted.
Right.
- Yes, sir?
- Morgan will fill you in.
All right, sir.
And what did the great man of science have to say today? More of the usual?
Oh, he's trying, Ben.
Just like the rest of us.
And nothing works.
The streets are swarming with truckloads of bodies... that they're throwing into that God-awful pit.
And the dedicated Dr. Mercer goes on... with his plodding, unimaginative approach.
- You have a better idea?
- Maybe.
- At least it involves imagination.
- Ben, it's as simple as this.
An unknown germ is being blown around the world.
It's highly contagious, and it's reached plague proportions.
And you don't believe some of the dead have come back?
Let's get to work.
And why are they burning the bodies?
Why don't they bury them?
Because it's the best known way to control the contagion... to keep the germ from spreading.
That's what we've always believed, at any rate.
- You'd prefer us to believe in vampires?
- If they exist, yes.
There are stories being told, Bob.
By people who are out of their minds with fear!
Maybe, but there are too many to be just coincidental.
Stories about people who have died, and have come back.
They're stories, Ben, stories.
And why are the infected people always so tired in the daytime?
Why can't they stand the sunlight?
Why are they only seen at night?
Come here.
- Look.
- I know as well as...
Look!
- Now, is this bacilli or isn't it?
- It doesn't alter...
And this bacilli is found in the blood of every infected person, or isn't it?
To show me germs is not to refute these stories, Bob.
The point is, if there are vampires, they exist in spite of these germs.
Come on, let's get to work.
Until further notice this station... will continue its around-the-clock coverage of this national disaster.
And now we switch you to the state capitol... where His Excellency, the Governor is speaking from the executive mansion.
Further, I have in conjunction with the Federal Government... declared this state to be a disaster area.
The public health is dependent on the bodies of the deceased being burned.
You must notify the Health
Department immediately... if you have a plague victim in your home.
Under no circumstances should you gather publicly.
In view of the dire emergency that exists, I intend to...
Anything new?
No, nothing new.
Nothing.
Mommy, where are you?
Mommy, I can't see.
Mommy...
- I'm going to call the doctor.
- I said no.
Virge, there's nothing they can do.
- But we can't just let her lie there.
- Well, this way she has a chance.
If you call a doctor, he'll report it.
Do you want that?
Mommy, help me.
Mommy...
Mommy, please help me.
Mommy, help me.
- How can you be so sure she's...
- Blindness is one of the symptoms.
You're not to call a doctor under any circumstances.
No one is to come into this house.
Now remember that.
Mommy... Mommy...
Mommy, where are you?
I've got to pick Ben Cortman up on the way to the lab.
No one is to come into this house.
Now remember that!
No! No! No! Please!
Please don't let him be buried in the pit.
Please, for God's sake.
Don't take him away like this.
You can't! You can't!
- Who's there?
- It's me, Ben. We're late.
Ben, what's the matter with you?
Nothing. And I'm going to keep it that way.
- Ben! Look, let's talk about this.
- There's nothing to talk about.
You think I'm out of my mind.
You laughed at me and my theory.
You might be one of them.
Ben, look, you're ill.
You ought to see a doctor.
No doctors.
You take care of your life.
I'll take care of mine.
Now get away from here.
You understand? Get away from here!
If you're looking for anybody but me, forget it.
- Are they all gone?
- That's right.
Is there any hope from the latest reports?
No, not yet.
But believe me, Morgan, we'll find an answer.
When, Doctor?
We need it right now. I need it!
You're the only one who wasn't afraid to come here today.
What's going to happen, Dr. Mercer?
Is everybody in the world going to die before someone finds the answer?
No, I don't think so.
I don't deny that there's some strange evolutionary process going on.
But mankind won't be destroyed.
The fact that you and I are working here today... is evidence of that.
All right. Let's roll.
When?
When?
I called a doctor. I had to.
I told you not to call anyone.
Bob, she was blind.
She couldn't see.
She kept reaching out her hands, and groping for me.
And all of a sudden she was gone.
And they came... and I tried to stop them. They took her.
I saw a truck out there.
Was that it? Was it?
Yes.
I'm sorry, lady. There's nothing I can do.
Let that truck through. Get out of the way.
Get back, folks. Nobody's allowed out there.
Please, all of you. Get behind those lines.
Look sharp there. Move. Move along.
Make way for that truck. This way.
Hey, you, mister! Come back!
Did this truck just come in from Market Street?
I said, did this truck just come in from Market Street?
Mister, I don't know.
Hey, you don't belong in here. Get out.
- I said get out!
- I want my daughter.
Mister, a lot of daughters are in there, including my own.
Bob, I can't see!
I can't see!
Virge!
Virge.
No.
I won't let them put you there, Virge.
I promise.
I won't let them put you there.
Let me in.
Let me in.
Let me in.
Let me in.
Let me in.
Let me in.
Who is it?
Who's there?
Robert.
Robert.
Robert.
Morgan.
We're going to kill you, Morgan.
Morgan? Do you hear?
Morgan.
Morgan!
Do you hear, Morgan?
Morgan? Do you hear, Morgan?
If Cortman thinks he can get to me by destroying my car... his wits are getting dull.
This convertible would be nice.
Probably handles well.
But I can't think of comfort.
There was a time when I shopped for a car... but now I'm looking for a hearse.
This station wagon will have to do.
Alive.
It's alive!
Wait. Don't run away!
Come back here.
Don't run away!
Come back. Come back here!
Wherever he is, I've got to find him.
If I have to search every street, every house, every alley... every inch of this town,
I've got to find him.
Come back!
Hey, boy, where are you?
Where are you, pal? Come here.
They're dead.
They've been staked!
But these are made of iron, not wood like mine.
Someone else is alive in this world.
But where are they? Where are they hiding?
How many are there? Where did they come from?
Why haven't I seen them?
This is Robert Morgan.
If somebody can hear me, answer me.
For God's sake, answer me!
This is K-O-K-W calling.
K-O-K-W calling.
Answer me.
So you finally decided to come back.
It's alright boy.
Good boy.
Oh, no.
Don't worry, boy.
You're going to be all right. Yes, you are.
There now, we've got you all cleaned up.
You're gonna feel better.
Gonna put you down here now and you can rest.
Got you all cleaned up.
You know they're out there, don't you?
You poor driven thing.
Everything's going to be all right.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
Everything's going to be all right.
All right.
You're going to get better.
We're going to have lots of happy times together.
You'll see. Everything's going to be fine.
What's the use?
Wait, I'm not going to hurt you.
Can't you understand? Wait!
Wait.
I'm not going to hurt you. Wait.
I couldn't be out here in the daylight if I was one of them.
You know that they can't come out until sundown.
Do you want to come with me, or do you want to face them?
- You feeling better?
- Yes.
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Thank you.
- You seem very well organized here.
- Yeah.
My name is Ruth Collins.
I was married.
I lost my husband.
You are alone?
- You were married?
- Yes.
Children?
A daughter.
What are you doing?
Please, stop! Stop it, please!
You're making me sick.
Why do you turn away? Why do you turn away?
- You are infected.
- No.
Infected systems are allergic to garlic.
- You think I'm one of them.
- You will be.
You've made up your mind just because I...
You can't change the facts by talking.
Facts? What facts?
That I got sick?
I've had a sensitive stomach all my life.
I saw my husband killed. Torn to pieces, right in front of our house.
I've been wandering ever since.
Hiding at night. Not eating more than scraps.
Sick with mourning, sick with fear, unable to sleep.
Then you shout at me.
You chase me across the field, hit me... drag me to this house, and to top it all... when I get sick because you shove a piece of reeking garlic in my face... you tell me I'm infected.
- Where are you going?
- Let me go.
You can't go out there. It's almost sunset.
- Let me go, I said.
- You can't go out there now.
In a few minutes the streets will be full of them.
- I don't care.
- At least let me give you a blood test.
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
You must be hungry. I'll fix you some dinner.
- You know, you should eat.
- I can't.
- You seem used to them.
- As much as anybody could be.
I'm not frightened of them anymore, if that's what you mean.
I protect myself against them, but only because there are so many.
Individually, they're weak.
Mentally incompetent, like animals after a long famine.
If they weren't... they surely would've found a way of breaking in here a long time ago.
Come out, Morgan.
Hear that?
That's Ben Cortman.
- He was my friend.
- Your friend?
He was like a kid brother.
If I could find him and destroy him...
But you said he was your friend.
When I find him I'll drive a stake through him, just like all the others.
But you lived through all this.
Do you know why?
Perhaps I was chosen.
That's a laugh.
Or perhaps it's because a long time ago when I worked in Panama...
I was bitten in my sleep by a bat.
My theory is that the... the bat had previously acquired the vampire germ.
By the time it entered my blood... it had been strained and weakened by the bat's system.
As a result, I have immunity.
It's only a guess, but it's all I have to go on.
You don't think that I'm immune, do you?
It's a simple matter to find out whether you are or not.
What will you do if I am infected?
Cure me?
You don't have to answer.
I know as well as you do... it's incurable.
There might be a way.
If not of killing the germ, at least of containing it, keeping it from spreading.
If I had the equipment, the time.
Which you don't.
You are one of them.
I was. And without that injection,
I'll be one again.
What do you mean?
- You found a solution?
- That's right.
Exactly as you said it could be.
I take that for it.
What is it?
Defibrinated blood, plus vaccine.
The blood feeds the germ... the vaccine keeps it isolated... and prevents it from multiplying.
We've had it for some time now.
We?
We?
There are quite a number of us.
And I thought you were alone.
I was going to cure you.
- Does that amuse you?
- No.
Now, I want the truth.
I want all of it. Why are you here?
To find out if you know any more than we do.
You know far less.
We're alive. Infected, yes. But alive.
We're going to reorganize society.
Do away with all those wretched creatures who are neither alive nor dead.
Start everything all over again.
And you want me to join?
You can't join us.
You're a monster to them.
Why do you think I ran when I saw you?
Even though I was assigned to spy on you.
Because I was so terrified of what I'd heard about you.
You're a legend in the city.
Living by day instead of night.
Leaving, as evidence of your existence, bloodless corpses.
Many of the people you destroyed were still alive.
Many of them were loved ones of the people in my group.
I didn't know.
- Is there any way you can get out of here?
- What do you mean?
They're coming after you tonight.
That's why I was sent here.
To prevent you from resisting them.
I'm supposed to keep you here until they come.
- To kill me?
- Yes.
Your new society sounds charming.
The beginning of any society is never charming or gentle.
And you pretended to be shocked at my violence.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Why don't you go on and use it?
Get it over with. Use it!
Get it over with!
Now you know.
What are you going to do?
- What are you doing?
- It's already done.
What?
Look.
Look!
You see? It worked, Ruth.
The antibodies in my blood worked.
My blood has saved you, Ruth.
Do you know what this means?
You and I can save all the others.
We won't be alone.
We'll never be alone again.
You are sure?
Wait.
Don't be afraid.
- Where are you going?
- I have to get out of here...
- and tell them you're not a threat to us.
- You can't go out there.
You can save all of us.
When they come here there won't be time... for questions and answers.
They'll come to kill.
For God's sake, Robert, let me go.
Oh, Robert, please.
Ruth, look. Tomorrow.
Please. Robert.
Tomorrow, Ruth. Tomorrow will be all right.
Robert, no.
- Robert.
- Yes, Ruth?
- What if this doesn't last?
- But it will.
I've already checked it under the microscope.
Wait, I'll show you.
I'll prove it to you. I'll check it again.
Ruth, just take a look at this.
This'll prove it to you.
Ruth, there's no change.
I've double... checked.
- Robert!
- Ruth.
- Ruth!
- Robert!
Ruth!
Get away from her.
Ruth, are you all right?
Are you all right?
Run, Robert! Robert, run!
Run! They've come to kill you, Robert.
Run! Run!
Up there!
There he is.
Wait, you don't understand. Wait!
Get him! Get him!
Wait!
Surround the block. Move! Move!
This way. Hey, over here.
This way. Cover all sides!
Stand back.
There he is! In the church!
Over there!
Hold your fire!
Freaks!
All of you.
All of you, freaks. Mutations.
Hold it.
You're freaks.
I am a man.
The last man.
Robert!
They were afraid of me.
They were afraid of me.
They were afraid of me.
They didn't know.
Don't cry. There's nothing to cry about.
We're all safe now.
All safe.
Is life everything, and death nothing?
Or is life nothing, and death everything?
This film begins where
"At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul" ended!
Zé do Caixão, obsessed with having a perfect son, killed many people, and the ghosts of his victims returned to haunt him in hallucinations...
He's still alive!
He had luck, and probably will be able to see again.
The defendant Josefel Zanatas, known as Zé do Caixão, is absolved by this court.
The evidence against him wasn't enough to condemn him.
THIS NIGHT I'LL POSSESS YOUR CORPSE
Zé do Caixão! Zé do Caixão!
Jesus Christ!
People are always the same.
Ignorant...
Superstitious...
Inferior!
But they will accept the truth, even if I must... make their eyes shed tears of blood!
How is everything, Bruno?
There's the most perfect creation of nature: Children!
Pity that they grow up to become idiots.
In search of nothing.
Lost in a labyrinth of egoism... and dominated by a non-existent force:
The faith in the immortality of the spirit.
Man in his stupidity doesn't comprehend the only truth of life:
The immortality of blood.
He's crazy!
Come on, it was nothing.
The danger is over!
I'm scared.
Come on, don't cry, my boy!
Listen... Do you like music?
Carlinhos...
Are you all right?
So good nothing happened.
It was a miracle...
God must have sent you.
God? Why not the Devil?
Stupid fanaticism!
A child, any child, is the most precious creature in the universe!
Take care of them, otherwise not even your
God will save you from Hell!
So, you're the famous Zé do Caixão?
I liked to see your act of courage.
You're a true hero.
Congratulations. Congratulations.
Who is she?
She's the heiress of the Morani family.
She's been living alone in a house across the street... since she arrived here two months ago.
I must find the woman that will immortalize my blood.
Do you need anything?
Are you hungry?
So let me drink.
Leave me alone!
Miguel, if not for me, think of our son. He'll be born soon.
So, first let him born.
I'll think about it later.
Ah, go to hell!
I'm leaving you.
That's enough of this humiliation!
Well, here we are.
But father isn't expecting us until after tomorrow.
Gosh, the night is so dark.
Yes... it is.
Your medicine, Mrs. Márcia.
Thank you.
See if he's still out there.
Yes, he is.
Persistent!
- Are you finished, Luiza?
- Yes, Mrs. Márcia.
You may go now.
- We can stay, if you want.
- Thanks, it's not necessary.
- Good night.
- You can go, don't worry.
- Goodbye, Mrs.
- Goodbye.
There's no need for violence.
I've been waiting for you.
I'm innocent! I was near
Márcia's house when she disappeared, but this wasn't the first time.
My intention was only to see her.
Nobody is guilty!
However, six women had disappeared.
All the evidence points to you, Truncador.
Homero, I vouch for Truncador.
If he's proven guilty, you can arrest me as his acessory.
Well, Colonel, if you vouch for him, that changes things.
We'll continue to investigate.
Because this is a serious problem, it would be better to ask the government for help.
I'll go to the capitol immediately.
We still haven't obtain official help, but God will bring our wives and daughters back.
- We must do something!
- We must find the responsible for this!
- Where's my fiancée?
- I want my daughter back!
Zé do Caixão is guilty!
He looks like the Devil!
I don't doubt it.
He's the only one in this town who doesn't seem to care... about the great misfortune that fell on us.
Let's arrest him before he runs away!
Zé do Caixão is guilty.
Why?
Because I'm different?
Because I don't have the same beliefs as you?
I'm as guilty as any one of you!
You! Who can say that you're not guilty?
Maybe your wife left because she wanted to, huh?
And you! Could you be guilty?
Not, not you.
The Colonel's word vouches for your innocence.
And why not any one of you?
Are you all innocent?
No! The children are the only innocent.
Only instinct is absolutely pure.
You aren't certain.
You can't be sure.
So, how can you dare accuse me?
I'll bring the criminal in at any price.
Then you can make your justice!
Good evening, sweethearts.
What's the reason to exist?
Good?
Evil?
Pain?
Pleasure?
No.
Only life.
And what comes after death?
Nothing!
So, immortality is in the blood!
How does man achieve his fulfillment?
And what is this fulfillment?
Ason!
Blood of his own blood!
Man is only immortal through the fetus!
A fetus that one of you women, imperfect as you are, will give me.
But I'll have to choose the most complete among you.
The one that'll give birth to the pure man, the immortal race!
The healthy mind in the perfect body.
When I decided to bring you here,
I made sure that all of you...
...had no faith. Splendid!
Four are materialists, daughters of atheists.
You, Jandira, I don't know if you believe in anything, but I know that you didn't marry in a Catholic church.
Why? No faith?
Good, very good.
You, Márcia... still uncertain, and everyone says that you are a Godless woman.
Magnificent!
Religion: A stupid invention created by men in order to forget their misfortunes.
When he is born with the perfect instinct, he can leave his mark of what he really is, and set free from all this foolishness.
Nothing more than the ruin of the superior animal, man.
This man can only come from the union of two perfect beings.
In exchange, I offer... fortune!
And also, the immortality.
I don't know for sure the fate of the ones I don't choose.
Maybe life.
Maybe death.
The test is over.
A little scare to measure your courage.
Cowards!
Fools!
Bruno will tend to your wounds.
Wait for me... in my bedroom.
So...
Everything's perfect?
What do you want?
To be fair... and generous... to spare you from an unfair life.
I want to be sure that your beauty won't be destroyed by time.
And that you won't give birth to a greedy and cruel race.
We accept your advice, and we thank you.
But, please, leave us alone!
No!
What's the use of life to those who don't believe in it?
What's the use of life, when it's filled with war, hatred and the triumph of lies?
I prefer liberation.
And I, with my superior wisdom, with my superior mind,
I'll offer you peace, fortune and supreme happiness.
I don't understand you, make it clear.
What are you going to do to us?
Kill all of you.
No, I can't believe it!
I always keep my promises.
Don't worry, sweethearts, in a few hours, I'll send you to the mansion of the Gods of Olympus.
Bruno, if I'm not wrong, I've promised you a birthday present...
Yes.
For your good service, you'll get your present ahead of time.
You may choose the one you like best.
That one!
She's yours!
No! No! No!
Let her go, for God's sake!
You're a sadist! Let her go...
I don't like dramas!
Her luck isn't really all that bad anyway.
Dirce, oh, Dirce...
You know, boss... she screamed... so I grabbed her neck, slowly...
But it was thin, very thin...
I'm sorry, boss.
She was your gift, anyway.
Monster!
I can imagine what will happen to us.
Oh, Dirce, my sister!
My sister!
Enough! I hate dramas!
Choose...
This door will bring you a surprise worthy of the feast of kings...
Or... do you prefer Bruno?
You also can choose.
Look well. Look well.
Dirce!
Decide!
I will count to three.
One...
Two...
Three...
No, open the door!
I want to go out!
- Damned!
- Crazy!
My child will grow in the womb of a superior woman...
Get me out of here... for God's sake!
Stop, stop! I can't stand this cruelty!
Can you save them?
Get down and try it...
No, I can't.
Damn you!
Damned are all those who, like you, destroy human lives!
Damn you!
Even if you hide in the mysteries of time, my curse will get to you!
You'll never have the son you desire so much...
In all incarnations, you'll search for this crazy and impossible dream...
And... before you imagine...
I shall return to... avenge my death...
How are you going to kill me?
Come. I don't fear your sadism!
Not sadism, my dear...
Science!
The deaths of those women weren't a sacrifice.
Just a contribution to a superior race.
A race that'll become immortal through the control of instinct.
I study human behavior.
Those women hated me, but during their slow death, they showed all their hypocrisy.
Well, you can go.
You're free. You showed courage.
You're going to free me knowing that I can report you to the police?
You'll never do that.
You love me.
Those who love are weak, because love corrupts the mind.
So, it's a bad feeling.
It was sad to see love in your eyes. Very sad.
If it wasn't for this weakness, you could be the mother of my child.
Clean up this mess!
I don't know anything.
I had to go on a trip.
I have nothing to say about the missing women.
Yeah.
Things are complicated.
I can't see why.
There was only a coincidence between Márcia's trip and the disappearance of the ladies.
We still don't have a clue.
So long, gentlemen.
I have to go too.
Are you staying, Cláudio?
No, I have things to do.
Goodbye, father. So long.
Any news about my daughter?
Does Márcia know anything?
I don't know, ask the officer.
Márcia, we are having a party tonight.
My daughter is arriving, and we're going to announce her engagement.
I hope you can join us.
I'll be there, Colonel.
Thanks.
Let me through.
Try it!
Let me through!
There's nothing stopping you.
Was he invited?
I don't know. Nobody likes him, including your father.
Truncador, there's no time for this now.
But, Mr. Cláudio...
The Colonel will speak with you tomorrow.
I think you'd better go.
Papa wouldn't like to see you around here.
Why? It's a pleasant way to amuse myself.
It's better to you go away.
Tonight we're having a party in your honor.
You can't go in.
You need an invitation.
Will this do?
Funerary Josefel Zanatas
Flowers, Crowns and Coffins of All Kinds
How bold.
Calm down, Colonel. It's alright.
Tomorrow, at midnight, I'll wait for you... at the Alley of the Red Flowers.
What did that man said to you, Laura?
That I play well.
Alley of the Red Flowers
Midnight.
You are punctual.
When I want to be.
You aren't afraid of me?
No.
They say that I am cruel, and a sadist...
Don't you fear me?
If you kill me now, you would only bring on the single truth of life... which is death.
What do you believe in?
You!
What superior force is there between life and death?
You!
What do you want from life?
A child born from two perfect beings!
Your father hates me.
The world condemns me.
I want to be yours!
You'll be mine when the time comes.
And when the time comes,
If you show yourself worthy, you'll be the superior woman... and mother to my son.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Is Laura still upstairs?
She won't take long.
I'll be right back. Excuse me, father.
What a mess.
I know everything, Laura.
So what?
You can't do that. This man is the incarnation of Devil.
I'm a different kind of woman, brother.
I don't mind being the mistress of the Devil.
You...
What are you waiting for?
I know what I must do.
You mean...
I'll buy all your properties for twice what they're worth.
But you must leave town immediately.
In fact, that's a great idea.
I want you to leave today.
You have a deal.
In a few of hours I'll bring you all of your money.
Did you come here to kill me?
No. On the contrary.
I need your precious help.
I like punctuality.
Does anyone know that you're here?
No one. Now let's make one thing clear.
Great.
That makes my job easier.
Stop joking. This is a serious manner.
Here's your money!
But the problem is more complicated than you think.
We can't waste any time.
Bruno! Now it's your turn!
Did you like that?
You're so strong, Truncador.
You look like Hercules.
Your muscles make me feel... safe.
I like you too.
I want you for myself, only myself.
I want you too, but I need comfort, luxury and more money.
I'll get a lot of money, a lot of money.
I like a man with a strong will.
Go buy something to drink.
We must celebrate.
Okay.
My boss challenges anyone of you to a game of poker.
Does anyone accept, huh?
I accept the challenge.
Be here in an hour.
- I'll be here.
- Yeah...
Tell your boss to bring a lot of money.
Everything set?
Let's go.
Look!
There's no difference between a mouse and a human being.
We are all animals.
Look. This is the end of life.
And your end will follow.
No, you're not brave enough.
Coward!
Inferior!
Prepare him!
No, I'm not insane.
Or even perverse.
On the contrary,
I am the salvation of you and of all humanity.
The only creature that fights without asking for anything in return... for the survival of a race that isn't awake.
They wait in vain for God.
If He existed, my friend,
I would be there and you would be here.
So, it's proven.
There's no invisible force.
But something has to rule the Earth.
A perfect force.
Oh, Nature?
No!
It's proven, how long would these nails grow if I didn't cut them?
Till hold my fingers.
But, there's a superior force:
The mind of the perfect man, free of feelings, guided by Instinct.
And I shall immortalize him!
I leave you in the hands of your God.
If he extinguishes the fire, you are safe.
If not... have a good trip.
Ah, one last favor...
If you go to Heaven, say hello to the angels.
But if you wind up in Hell,
But if you wind up in Hell,
Interesting, Truncador.
Great. You'll beat Zé do Caixão.
I'll even take his funeral parlor.
I've played poker since I was a child.
The only way he can beat me is if he really is the Devil.
You will win.
Show that you know more than him.
Everybody will admire you.
Nobody likes that man.
I'll give you luxury and money.
A lot of money.
And kisses!
It's time. Hurry. And later... you can celebrate a double victory!
The money... and me!
You lose again.
It's not possible!
Do you think I'm the Devil?
My luck will change.
We can raise the bet.
Yes, we can.
Okay.
Cards?
- Two.
And you, how many?
One.
Show me your cards.
Today is my lucky day!
I hope you won't take long to pay what you lost to me.
I'll pay soon, demon!
What happened?
He's been after me for a while.
He said he would've money for me if I gave him love.
- She's lying, lying!
- Shut up!
I didn't kill anyone!
I didn't kill anyone!
We'll see that later.
Mrs. Márcia, you're free to go.
Thank you.
By the way, what about the Colonel?
He's shocked because of his son's death.
I see.
Well, at least the guilty man is behind bars.
- Good night.
- Good night.
My son, my son!
Oh, Cláudio, my son!
My son...
You'll be mine when the time comes...
Has the time come?
I killed your brother!
I want to be yours!
Yes, you are the superior woman.
You'll be mine!
You'll be the mother of my child!
Damn her!
Damn her for she humiliate us by living with that disgusting gravedigger!
She didn't even respect her brother's funeral and her parents' suffering!
Calm down, my son.
God knows what He does.
If we forgive her, Father Ramiro, she'll come back home.
She's right.
We shall have mercy on her.
NEVER!
I won't kill them, but Laura will never step foot in this house again!
It's not possible!
Truncador escaped! Escaped!
I want the best gunmen... don't save efforts.
Zé do Caixão must be eliminated.
He's responsible for all these crimes.
I'll hire brave men, boss.
I'll kill that damn gravedigger!
The criminal escaped.
Yes, and I still don't have any news about Jandira.
I feel guilty.
She was so sad when she left, and what... makes me more sad is knowing that she was pregnant.
I'm so miserable.
Look... she was so beautiful!
You'll be afraid, because this night I'll possess your corpse!
What did you say about a child?
She was pregnant, Mr. Zé.
Pregnant.
She was pregnant?
Aren't you lying?
She was going to have a child?
Yes, Mr. Zé. A child.
A child...
A child...
A little one...
What is it, Zé?
Something wrong?
Talk to me, don't let me worried!
What happened, Zé?
Talk to me! What happened?
Talk, Zé! Tell me what's wrong!
ENOUGH!
I'm sorry, Laura.
If you acted like this, you had a reason.
Laura, one of the women
I killed was pregnant!
I killed a child!
I understand, but you don't have to be worry.
You only destroyed an imperfect creature.
I... can't avoid this thoughts.
I hear Jandira's curse.
Madness. Nothing more than madness!
All the lies about reincarnation.
Those lies will be destroyed by the force of your wisdom.
Wisdom...
The superior being...
But I didn't even plant the seed of my legacy.
You will.
My womb will take the seed that'll immortalize the perfect man.
No! No!
No! No!
Laura! Laura!
No! Laura!
No! No!
Laura! Laura!
No! No! No!
Laura! Laura!
No! Laura!
Let me go!
Laura!
No!
Let me go!
Laura! Laura!
I don't want to, I don't, I don't...
No!
No!
Let me go! Let me go!
It's a lie! It's all lies!
No! I don't want to go!
No, no...
Please, spare me from the suffering!
Too much misery!
Life has its laws...
Law, law... LAW!
Get me out of here.
Too much suffering... too much.
Get me out of here!
It's a lie! It's a lie!
NO!
No, that's not possible! No!
Law, law, law!
I don't believe in laws!
I only believe in the strength of man!
Now I know where I am!
You brought me here to tell me that
I'm doomed to the tortures of Hell!
NO!
NO!
Lies!
I don't believe!
I am eternal! Eternal, do you hear me?
I'll never be tortured!
My life is eternal. Eternal!
- I'll possess your corpse!
- Laws...
- I'll possess your corpse!
- Laws...
- I'll possess your corpse!
- Laws...
- I'll possess your corpse!
- Laws...
- I'll possess your corpse!
- Laws...
- No! Not this punishment!
- I'll possess your corpse...
NO!
NO!
Hell is a lie! It doesn't exist!
Sure, Zé, there's no Hell.
I saw it, I was there!
Calm down, Zé, it was only a nightmare!
But I was there!
I heard my victims promise revenge.
No, there's no Hell.
Yes, I know. It doesn't exist.
It must be my tormented mind.
Visions of Hell trying to destroy me.
Never! You're strong and invincible!
I can't deny the imperfections of my parents.
The obsessions and stupid legacy of a mediocre race.
Moral, tradition of people.
Just tradition!
These imbeciles try to justify their own incapacity.
All this still lives inside me.
Laura, Laura...
I need a son, Laura!
So he can keep the traits of the superior man!
Thus shall be.
Fine. You'll be rewarded.
Now go on with the mission.
They were the very best I could find.
I want the grave digger alive.
I want him alive!
We'd better go.
Truncador brought the bad men!
They're going to kill the gravedigger.
Things will get ugly today.
We better stay out of the way.
Nice of you to visit, doctor.
I came to see Laura.
Has something happened?
She will tell you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Zé! Zé! I'm pregnant!
Your dream came true!
Ason...! Ason...!
Ason...! Ason...!
My blood will be immortalized!
Ason, Laura!
I have to tell the people.
Everyone must know, Laura.
Everyone must know!
I can hear. It'll be a boy!
Yes Zé, it'll be a boy!
My blood will be eternal.
The perfect man will be born... born with the knowledge of instinct.
Then, his instinct will dominate with superior mind.
His mind will reign, and he'll be immortal!
Everyone must know.
The people must know.
Zé do Caixão will have a son, a perfect son, Laura.
Let's drink!
Ungrateful people!
They don't want to drink with me.
They're envious of my superiority.
Ah, it doesn't matter!
Tell them, Henrique:
Zé do Caixão will be a father!
A father!
A child...
The most precious thing in life. A child...
A perfect child.
Good night.
My mission is accomplished.
I don't need to live anymore.
I've already have my son to make me eternal.
No! He isn't yet born!
And if anything happens?
I can't die.
I must defend my son from the inferior men!
No! No! No!
Let me go! Let me go!
No!
Son of Belzebut! Today you're going to meet your father!
Calm down, Cadavérico.
The Colonel wants him alive.
Besides, his death isn't going to be so pleasant.
I understood, but I want to kill him myself!
I promise you.
- Tatuado, prepare the wagon.
- Right now, Truncador!
And you, Omulu, get out of the way.
I'll take the man.
No! No!
Come on, guys!
Make yourself comfortable, man!
Eya! Eya! Eya!
So, this little thing is the one terrorizing the town, huh?
And think, Truncador, that you've hired us just for this!
I won't rest until I see the buzzards eating his flesh.
Tomorrow you'll be satisfied!
This place is strange, huh?
Not only strange, but dangerous also.
We must take care.
The ground isn't safe.
We'll walk.
I can't die.
My son isn't born yet!
I can't die.
My son isn't born yet!
I can't die.
My son isn't born yet!
Devil!
- Damned!
- Go after him!
- Come on, hurry!
- Damned!
- Come!
- Faster!
Hurry, everybody, run!
Where are you hiding, man?
Show your courage!
Don't hide like a frightened armadillo!
Show yourself!
Your wish is my command!
It was Cadavérico!
You were right, Truncador, that man is the Devil!
I won't rest until I see him sweating drops of blood!
We'll find the demon!
Don't look any further, friends!
I'll make your job easier.
Here I am.
You'll regret this courage.
Get him!
Damn you! Damn you!
- It's a swamp!
- He fooled us!
Damn you!
Help!
Damn you! Son of the Devil!
Help me!
In fact, Zé do Caixão had nothing to do with those men's disappearance.
It's proven that was an accident.
They didn't know the area, and...
Zé do Caixão won again.
There's no doubt:
That man make a deal with the Devil!
I can't stand having this on my conscience!
We found her this way, doctor.
I must talk...
Zé... Zé do Caixão committed all those crimes.
I was his accomplice in the murder of the Colonel's son.
The disappearing women were all killed... brutally.
Madam! Madam! My madam!
Well, doctor?
Unfortunately, there was nothing I could do.
Hurry up, doctor.
Madam Laura isn't feeling well.
- I'll go with you!
- Hush, doctor.
She told everything.
She said before dies that Zé do Caixão murdered the women and the Colonel's son.
I knew it...
I just wasn't sure how to avenge myself.
Now the people will be on my side, and we'll have our own justice!
Well, doctor?
There's a small chance, and If it works, only one life can be saved:
Laura or the baby.
Save the child, doctor!
Yes, doctor, save the child!
Save my son!
Only God can decide.
We can't waste any time.
I need some hot water.
You can't star here.
Get out! Come, get out!
My people, we can't wait any longer.
Terror has struck our town.
One man only is the cause of all this tragedy. Zé do Caixão.
That's true!
I tried, Zé. Don't hate me!
Forgive me!
Unfortunately, science can't perform miracles.
She didn't resist.
No! No!
Laura isn't dead.
Her womb is sacred.
She carries the son of the superior man, the man that'll save the human race.
Laura!
Laura!
Laura!
My son!
My son!
LAURA!
You can't die!
You can't, Laura!
Our son isn't born yet!
You didn't give me a son, Laura!
No! No!
Our son, Laura!
Our son.
Damned!
Damned! Weak!
Slaves of nothing!
Your false belief will never defeat my power!
It doesn't matter, search the roads and the swamp!
Colonel, Laura is dead!
Damn him! He destroyed us.
His madness about the immortality of blood... only brought us tragedy!
I'll drive the Devil from our land!
Let's kill Zé do Caixão!
Let's go! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
You'll rest here, Laura.
Nobody will disturb your sleep.
They'll never come here.
They're afraid! Afraid!
You'll fear this moment, because I'll possess your corpse, avenging the life you've destroyed!
You've not beaten me yet!
My son wasn't born but I'm not destroyed!
You aren't real!
Reincarnation doesn't exist!
You're an image from my tormented mind!
You're in the lake, rotting and disgusting!
You are only a lifeless vision!
I'll prove that you don't exist!
Instinct!
Supreme force!
Supreme force!
To whom does the Earth belong?
To God?
To the Devil?
Or to spirits of the dead?
Come, forces from beyond!
Untrue forces!
Which come from the twisted imagination... of an inferior race, that remains static since the beginning of time, without knowing the origin of its suffering.
Come, spirits, if you exist... and change my mind!
Show me the truth!
This doesn't convince me!
It was only an accident!
An accident of Nature.
Only the weak would convince themselves with such false proof!
A truth that doesn't exist!
I'm still the strongest!
The man superior to all the weakness in the world.
And to thy, elements of life...
To show you the truth!
Zé!
What do you want!
To save you!
You're crazy! I am strong and invincible. I don't need your help.
Zé, they all want to kill you.
Listen... they are coming!
Rats!
Take this crucifix and shout:
"I believe in God!".
They believe you've make a deal with the Devil.
Prove them wrong.
I'm not weak. God doesn't exist!
It's a lie!
Go to them and try to destroy me!
Come on, destroy me if you can!
I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD!
There's the damn murderer!
Don't try it, father. The people are with me. Zé do Caixão will be destroyed.
Let's kill the murderer!
I am immortal!
Stop! Careful in the swamp.
He can't get far!
You won't escape this time!
This is for my son!
Stand up!
Rise!
I am invincible!
Rise!
Nothing exists!
NOTHING!
It's all lies!
It's all lies!
I am indestructible!
If You've prevented the birth of my son, convince me!
Here I am, and here is my body.
If You exists, possess my corpse!
But You don't exist!
I alone exist, because
I am invincible... and I believe only in the power of blood, In heredity.
I want the truth!
The truth!
God! God!
Yes, God is the truth!
I believe in Your force!
Save me!
The cross! The cross, priest! The cross!
The symbol of the Son!
Man will only find truth when he searches for truth...
THE END
Transylvania...
Land of dark forests...
Dreaded mountains and black unfathomed lakes.
Still the home of magic and devilry as the nineteenth century draws to its close.
Count Dracula, monarch of all vampires...
...is dead.
But his disciples live on...
...to spread the cult and corrupt the world.
Not so fast, please.
Not so fast.
Easy, there. Steady!
What happened?
Hang on there. Hang on, my beauties.
There is nothing to be scared of, nothing to be afraid of.
Mother of God, it's a corpse!
I thought you were a corpse.
What's the matter?
Why have you stopped?
Just movin' this log out of the way, miss.
It was right in the middle of the road.
There, now.
Now we can get on our way.
Won't take long, miss.
We'll make good time now, I promise you.
Now, my beauties, let's
Get out of here. Come on.
Get a move on. Hup! Hup!
Good evening, miss.
- Welcome to The Running Boar, Fräulein.
- Thank you.
Our menu is simple, but I think you'll find it good.
Hot goulash, a dish of sauerkraut and our own red wine from the valley.
Will you be eating alone or with the rest of the passengers?
Alone, if you please. You see,
I am the only passenger, so I must.
- What? You're travelling alone?
- Yes, to the Academy Badstein.
It is not very much further on, is it?
I come from Paris and I am due tomorrow at the latest.
Look, if you are travelling alone, you better get back to the coach.
My lads will have fresh horses between the shafts in a trice.
What I mean is
You don't want him to go without you.
But he won't. The coachman knows I'm here.
I know he does, but he will want to get away as soon as possible.
Ho!
Stop!
- What did I tell you?
- But he had no right to leave without me.
I don't know what right he had or hadn't, he's gone and that's all there is to it.
What can we do?
Very well. I shall have to stay here tonight.
- For the night? You can't. I have no room.
- But what else I can do?
Johann, go to the farm at once and ask to borrow their cart.
Get along with you.
Just you sit down here and let me fetch you something good to eat.
We'll get you away tonight.
- We must.
- But...
Not having a room, you understand.
There.
This will put some warmth into you for the journey.
- Yes, Johan?
- I have got the cart in the back.
- Come on, we've no time to lose.
- But...
Johan is right. You must go.
Is that the stagecoach coming back?
- Don't open it.
- I must.
Wine.
For your journey
- Thanks, but I've already...
- Another glass.
This Tokaj is the twin brother to the rest of the Emperor’s cellar.
Rather different from the wine of the valley you were drinking.
- What a very wild night.
- Yes, isn't it?
I hope you have not far to go.
I am on my way to the Ladies Academy at Badstein.
The Lang School? I know it well.
But I thought I passed the stagecoach as I came down here.
Left me here, I'm afraid.
Forgive me but...
...I was wondering if, by any chance, you might be going that way.
They can't put me up here and I don't know what to do.
If you'll excuse me, my husband was mistaken.
We have a room if you want.
So you're going to the Langs of Badstein?
Yes.
I've got my first appointment there as a student teacher.
I start tomorrow and I did not want to give a bad impression by arriving late.
You needn't do that.
I can't take you over tonight...
...but I shall see that you get there early in the morning.
Meantime, you cannot stay in a poor place like this.
- There is nowhere else.
- Indeed there is.
I'm the Baroness Meinster.
My castle is in the hills, just above the village.
Please give me the pleasure
Of being my guest tonight.
- I shall be more than grateful.
- Let us waste no more time, then.
Come.
- You are very kind, Madame.
- I'm nothing of the sort.
I am a very lonely old woman who often longs...
...for the company of someone with a little breeding.
A rare thing in these parts.
Let me introduce myself, Madame.
My name is Marianne Danielle.
Thank you, Mademoiselle Danielle.
Greta, this young lady is staying the night with us.
See that she is comfortable.
We will have dinner in 10 minutes.
Can you be ready by then?
Yes, Madame.
Madame la Baronne is very kind, but still I'm intruding most terribly.
I had no idea she was expecting a guest.
Nobody is expected.
The Baroness always has a second place laid in case somebody should come.
And I have come, haven't I?
Yes.
Ten minutes.
Please do not keep Madame waiting.
You'll see more by daylight.
Madame is waiting.
Greta, you said she wasn't expecting anyone.
A guest, I mean.
But I saw a man on the balcony below.
He didn't look like a servant.
I am the only servant left at castle Meinster.
I felt sure I saw a young man.
- Madame is waiting. Are you about ready?
- Almost.
Aren't you having any soup?
I have very little appetite.
Greta tells me that you saw someone in the balcony below your room.
I thought I did.
I thought I saw a man, a young man.
- But I must have been wrong.
- You were not wrong. You saw my son.
- But I thought...
- You thought what I wanted you to think.
That I was an old woman living here alone.
Now you know that I'm not alone.
I have a son.
- Please, I don't wi...
- My son is ill.
I'm so very sorry.
His illness has destroyed my peace of mind in these last years.
You may not believe it, but we've had gay times here.
Balls, dinners...
- ...life.
- I'm sure.
People used to come from all over Europe, even from Paris to be my guests...
...until he ruined it all.
He ruined it all? How?
It hurt me too much not to be able to present my only child to my friends.
To have to keep him locked up.
Is he ill in his mind?
I never see him myself.
Greta looks after him.
She is his old nurse.
- You never see him yourself?
- He has made me suffer so appallingly.
He has his own rooms apart from the rest of the castle...
...only reached through that door.
But all that is nothing.
The vital thing is that you discovered its existence...
...and I have explained the situation.
But, Madame, are you sure he is happy there?
Are madmen happy?
Surely something can be done.
- Is there no doctor?
- We pray for death, he and I.
At least, I hope he does.
The people around here think he is dead already.
So I am told and I encourage that belief.
Encourage?
I see you are passing judgment on me, my child.
Sleep before you pronounce sentence.
I am feeling very tired.
May I say goodnight?
Of course, Madame. Good night.
Thank you and may I say...
...God bless you.
If only he could.
No. Don't do that.
Who are you?
Who are you?
- Why have you come here?
- I called to you from my window.
I've come to help you, if I can.
Help me?
Have you?
Come here, will you?
No, don't be frightened.
I want to look at you.
You are very beautiful.
So you have come to help me, have you?
Well, no one can do that,
Mademoiselle. No one can do that.
I was terrified you were going to throw yourself over the balcony.
I assure you I wasn't.
I can't.
Come closer.
Please, come closer.
You see, I...
I can't come to you.
But... it's inhuman!
My mother thinks of me as inhuman, doesn't she?
I suppose she's told you that I'm mad.
That I have to be locked away like this for everybody's sake.
Well, why shouldn't she?
And why shouldn't you believe her?
- I don't know what to believe.
- You see, Mademoiselle, this castle...
...the mountains, the dark acres of forest...
Even the valley below, belong to me.
They are my inheritance. I am Baron Meinster.
But my mother is a vicious, evil, jealous woman.
She's let people believe that I'm dead.
She wants them to think that the castle and the grounds have devolved upon her.
They might just as well have done so.
I'm more than half dead, already living shut away like this as I am.
I mustn't talk like that.
I promise to help you.
If you confide in me, I'm sure I can.
- Only tell me what to do.
- Could you...?
Could you, I wonder, find the key that fits this.
Where does your mother keep it?
Greta tells me it's in the locked drawer of the bureau in her bedroom.
- That's the room next to yours.
- I'll find it.
Will you? There are grave risks, you know.
- Do you think you dare?
- Yes, I dare.
- Monsieur Baron.
- Yes! Yes!
- I have found a key.
- Good. Throw it to me.
One moment.
Now you must get dressed at once and meet me outside, will you?
- Yes.
- But hurry.
Give me back that key.
- But, Madame, I...
- You have taken a key from my room.
Give it back to me. Do you hear me?
- I assure you, Madam, I have no key.
- You must have it.
- Give it to me! Give it to me!
- Leave me alone.
You haven't taken it to my son?
You little fool, you don't know what you have done!
- Help me. Help me.
- Easy. Don't worry.
She can't harm you now.
You have nothing to fear.
Go to your room and wait there.
Mother, come here.
No.
No, my son.
Mother!
Come here.
Now, mother, come along with me.
He's free. He's gone.
Oh, my God.
He's gone. Oh, God.
Oh God, help us. He's free.
He's free. Oh God, help us.
He's gone. He's gone. He's free.
He's Gone. Oh, my God.
Oh God, help us. He's free.
He's free. He's gone.
What's the matter?
He's free. The cunning devil.
Why was he locked up?
He's not mad.
No, he's not mad.
You know that much, don't you?
Who got him the key?
Was it you? You?
- Did you?
- Where is he?
Gone.
Out into the night.
The bats are about.
Listen.
There's a wolf howling down there.
He'll get them all astir, trust him.
You don't know what you have done, but I know.
Are you mad or what?
- Where is Madame la Baronne?
- She's not far away.
You want to see her?
Would you like that?
Would you?
Look!
You needn't be afraid. She's dead.
- What have you done?
- She's dead and he's free.
Don't blame me, mistress.
It was none of my doing.
No.
I've always kept faith with you.
Twenty years since I first saw you come to the castle here...
...with the old Baron and your little son.
A fine, handsome imp he was, too.
But you spoiled him. Oh, yes.
He was always self-willed and cruel and you encouraged him.
And bad company you kept, too.
You used to sit and drink with them, didn't you?
Yes, and you laughed at their wicked games.
Till in the end, one of them took him and made him what he is.
You have done what you could for him since then, God help you.
Keeping him here a prisoner, bringing these young girls...
...keeping him alive with their blood.
But the powers of darkness are too strong. They've beaten you.
He's free.
But he'll come back here.
That's certain.
He'll come back to his old Greta.
He'll come back.
He's got to come back here before cockcrow.
- Carl, let's have the travelling rug, will you?
- Yes, sir.
Good. Put it around her.
- She's not dead, is she?
- No.
Bad case of shock, I should say.
Exhaustion.
Now don't worry.
How far are we from Badstein?
Three or four kilometres.
You've been badly frightened, haven't you?
But there's nothing to be afraid of now.
I am a doctor. Dr. Van Helsing.
Now you just sit down here.
Landlord?
Coffee and cognac, please.
- I'm very sorry, sir.
- Please, this girl has been unwell.
Miss, I am glad to see you safe.
I'm afraid we are closed to customers this morning, sir.
Father Stepanek booked me a room here.
I'm Dr. Van Helsing.
- Oh yes, of course. I'm sorry, sir.
- I'll go and get you some coffee.
There's been a death in the village.
Hans's daughter, such a beautiful girl.
She was found dead in the forest.
- They are holding a wake there now.
- How did she die?
No one really knows.
But she's dead alright.
Her father Stepanek is away.
They're going to bury her in the churchyard without him.
- May I see her?
- You could see her, of course.
They probably would like you to, being a doctor.
But there's nothing that can be done.
I won't be long.
Wild garlic?
Yes, it's supposed to be a protection against evil. Vampires...
...and such. You must humour these local superstitions.
After all, who knows how she came by her death?
There's usually a good reason for all these old customs.
There's her father.
- He's a doctor.
- I'm so very sorry.
She was a good girl.
I can't believe she's dead.
If only the priest was here.
The whole night was like a bad dream.
- I can hardly believe it happened.
- Then don't talk about it.
The Baroness seemed so kind at first.
- But her son...
- Her son?
But... surely he's not still alive?
It's such a long story.
Do you feel well enough to travel?
- Yes.
- Goodbye and thank you.
- We'll be back later.
The next thing I remember was seen you.
I am afraid I have put you to a lot of trouble.
Not at all.
What was the name of this chateau where you stayed?
The chateau of Meinster.
- Do you know it?
- I know all of it.
And you are on your way to school for young ladies at Badstein.
I am to teach there French and deportment.
- I'm sure you'll do very well at both.
- Merci.
- What about your luggage?
- I left it behind at the chateau.
- I shall have to send for it.
- The chateau Meinster?
- I don't think that would be very wise.
- But...
Please let me explain.
I have been asked to make a study of a strange sickness.
Sickness partly physical, partly spiritual.
And may I know what it is?
Have you heard of the
"cult of the undead"?
- The undead?
- Yes.
- Have you hear of it?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure.
It is most prevalent in Transylvania and the Lower Danube.
And could it spread?
Unless it is stamped out.
That's why I'm here.
And you can help me.
I want you to tell me everything that happened in the chateau Meinster.
- But...
- Everything, in detail...
...leaving nothing out, however trivial it may seem to you.
- Will you do that?
- Yes.
And when you have told me,
I want you to forget it.
Forget it completely and never mention it to anyone.
- If that is what you wish.
- That is a promise?
- Yes.
- Good.
This is Mademoiselle Danielle.
She has come to take up her appointment.
Will you come in?
I'll tell the principal you are here.
I'll see to it, Elsa.
You must be Marianne Danielle, are you? I'm Frau Lang.
- Welcome to the Academy.
- Thank you.
This is Dr. Van Helsing.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
He has been kind enough to accompany me from the last village.
- Her coach broke down.
- There was an accident?
You are alright, aren't you, my dear?
No bones broken or anything?
- Thank you. I'm quite alright.
- But she lost all her luggage.
How unfortunate.
We can fix you up with anything you want until it's retrieved.
Come along and meet Herr Lang.
He'll have heard you arrive and he doesn't like to be kept waiting.
Between you and me, he's rather a stickler.
- I must get back to my...
- Oh no, please come too, Dr. Van Helsing.
You can help explain everything.
Mademoiselle is a little late and Herr Lang is so very punctilious.
A wonderful man...
...wonderful but just a little terrifying.
Now, girls, don't stand there staring.
Christina, you'll catch a fly in that mouth if you don't shut it, dear.
Let me do the talking.
Otto, my love...
- ...Mademoiselle has arrived.
- So I heard.
- Late.
- I'm sorry.
Mlle., punctuality comes next to cleanliness.
- But, Otto, the poor girl...
- Excuses, always excuses.
I assure you, sir, that this was unavoidable.
- And who might you be?
- A friend of Mademoiselle's.
I've made it a rule, sir, a rule of the Academy.
The staff are allowed no followers. No followers.
I'm a doctor.
Lydon University?
Almost a colleague.
My dear Dr. Van Helsing, you had only to tell me.
Heavens. How could I be expected to recognize...
...a doctor of philosophy, doctor of theology...
...professor of metaphysics by the cut of his trousers?
I trust, Herr Lang, that you will allow me to visit Mademoiselle during her stay?
My dear doctor, the rule is already rescinded in your favour.
Thank you. Now if you'll excuse me.
Dear sir, your most obedient servant, always.
Come along now, dear.
I'll show you your room.
Come along now, girls. No more dawdling.
You heard what I said.
Gina, I shall want you in a moment, dear.
How can I thank you enough for your kindness?
- By keeping your promise.
- I'll try.
And don't let that ogre in there frighten you.
Please call again whenever you may be passing, doctor.
Frau Lang.
- Goodbye, Mademoiselle.
- Au revoir.
Please, I can see myself out.
- Such a charming man.
- Yes, a kind man.
Yes. Gina.
She's a student teacher like you.
Gina, Mademoiselle has only just arrived and she doesn't know anybody.
I want you to show her to her room.
- Yes, Frau Lang.
- Room number 14.
I always feel strange when
I arrive in a new place, don't you?
You'll settle down. Come along.
Why, Father? Why should it happen to her?
She was like a mother to her two little sisters.
Why should God in his wisdom permit these things?
Where is she, my son?
Where is she, Hans?
You know I must go to her.
You're too late, father. She is buried.
Where?
In the churchyard, where else?
In hallowed ground?
Well, isn't that the right of every man and woman?
May God forgive you.
She's dead, isn't she? Why can't she lie in peace like all the rest?
Because she is not like all the rest.
You know how she died, my son.
I know how your heart bleeds but she can't lie there.
Please, father.
Please let her stay.
Even if you can't give her the blessing of our holy Mother Church...
...please let her stay.
My son...
...you must pull out of your mind the idea that she ever was your daughter.
She is no longer like the living.
Not even, God help us, the dead.
No.
Please drink this.
Poor man.
- And I am powerless. Powerless!
- Perhaps I can help.
- Who are you?
- You sent for me.
- Dr. Van Helsing.
- Thank God you've come.
Thank God.
There.
- Will you unpack yourself, sir?
- Thank you.
What is this... vampirism, should I call it?
It's the survival of one of the ancient pagan religions...
...in their struggle against Christianity.
And the first I suppose, the vampire?
The undead.
- And that passes on?
- Yes.
The vampire, by its kiss, taking the blood from its victim...
...makes it another vampire.
So, the cult grows.
Infinitely slowly, but it grows.
The vampire rests in the day, usually in his tomb...
...issuing as a living form only at night.
That means they need the help, the protection...
...of a human being during the hours of daylight.
For instance?
A mother who may hide an infected son or daughter.
Or a servant...
...either hypnotized or so devoted to the master...
...they don't realize the evil they are doing.
- A lost soul?
- Possibly.
If it wasn't for this protection...
...vampires could be tracked down during the day and destroyed.
How can they be destroyed?
By driving a wooden stake through the heart or by burning.
The tormented soul is then released to return to the peace of death.
These colonies, such as you have here, must be wiped out.
Only then will this bondage of hell be lifted from the world.
Are there ways of telling these undead from the living?
They are repelled by holy things and Christian images.
They are thin.
They have an air of hunger about them.
- They cast no reflection.
- Not in water?
- Not in a mirror?
- No.
And some have the power to transform themselves into bats.
- Is that the girl's grave?
- Yes, it must be.
There's still time. The sun's not down yet.
She won't be active until then.
Is that sacrilege?
No, father. It's, as I told you, an act of healing.
She'll be in God's hands again and can lie in consecrated ground.
I pray that it may be so.
If I don't stop her now, she'll rise again as an undead...
...and a new cycle of evil will begin.
Remember, they are my people.
I am their priest.
Then pray for me.
I will, my son.
And please...
...will you take this with you?
It contains holy water.
It may be of service to you.
Thank you, Father.
Wake up. Wake up.
Wake, dear, wake up.
It's time to awake you.
The master's waiting...
...waiting to see you.
Come on, wake up.
Wake up.
Wake up, my dear.
Are you about ready?
No, I can't help you.
You've got to be strong.
What?
Yes, I know it's dark, but you've got to push.
Yes, push.
That's right, push.
Now, just one little effort more.
You'll soon be here.
Come, now. Come, my precious.
That's right. Come, my little love.
There, the master is waiting.
There she is.
There she comes. There's my little beauty. A clever one.
There's my clever one.
Stop!
- In the name of the Almighty...
- Get away.
Get away from here.
Go, little one, quickly.
- I'll tear your eyes out.
- Hurry, my son, before the girl gets away.
Who is it that is not afraid?
Only God has no fear.
- Why do you come here?
- To find your son.
- Then you know who I am.
- I know who you were.
- He's escaped?
- Yes.
You'll never catch him.
He's too clever.
- He has taken the blood of his own mother.
- It was all my own fault.
I loved his wildness. I encouraged it.
And when this monstrous thing took possession of him...
...I didn't send for a priest or a doctor.
I hid him and helped him to live.
And now there is no release from this life...
...which isn't life or death.
And I know I shall have to do whatever hideous things...
...he asks me to.
There is one release.
Come in.
I am sorry, Frau Lang.
I did not know it was you.
It's perfectly alright, my dear.
I thought I'd better come with the news myself.
You know how the girls chatter.
- Well, my dear, he's here.
- Who?
Why haven't you told us you expect him?
Luckily, Herr Lang's gone down to the village.
I don't know what he'd say if he knew.
- But who is...?
- Come along, my dear...
...you mustn't keep him waiting.
- Monsieur Baron.
- See? Didn't I keep it to myself?
I wanted so much to meet you again...
...so I took this opportunity of bringing the luggage that you left behind.
- I thought that you might need it.
- How kind of you.
Your mother, Madam la Baronne, is she well?
I regret to have to tell you...
...she's dead.
Oh dear. Why, I'm sorry.
So now you are all alone, up in that great house?
- Exactly.
- Oh dear.
Now Monsieur, I should leave you entirely to yourselves...
...for 10 minutes.
Well, Marianne.
What are you doing?
Keeping an eye on things.
Trust me.
Keeping an eye on what?
- A pair of turtledoves, bless their hearts.
- Who?
Mademoiselle Danielle and a young man, dear.
What?
Stop. What do you think you're doing?
- Shameless little hussy.
- Herr Lang.
You know it's a rule, my rule.
The staff are allowed no followers.
What the devil do you think you are doing here?
I was placed here by a most charming lady.
In fact, your wife.
Don't you try to be impertinent to me, sir...
...or I shall have the privilege of throwing you headfirst out of that window.
You'll find it a most interesting way of making my closer acquaintance, Herr Lang...
...but hardly necessary under the circumstances.
I've long wanted to meet you, an old and valued tenant.
I'm no tenant of yours, you young jackass.
- I'm a tenant of the Meinster estate.
- Exactly, and I'm Baron Meinster.
I must apologize for not having called before...
...but I've been recovering from...
...a long illness.
I wouldn't have come today except that
I had some pressing business...
...to discuss with Mademoiselle Danielle, who has just consented to become my wife.
Wonderful.
I shall be grateful if you would allow
Mademoiselle to stay here for a few weeks...
...whilst I make arrangements for the wedding.
Of course. We should be more than honoured.
Oh, yes, indeed.
May I take this opportunity of congratulating you and Frau Lang...
...on having the most charming house and grounds.
- Mein Herrschaft.
- At so low a rent.
I'm so proud for you, Marianne.
What's it feel like to be a Baroness?
Not so fast. We are only engaged.
- Isn't he handsome?
- I think he is.
So he should be marrying you.
He's just like I imagined
Prince Charming was to look at.
So noble...
...and with such wonderful eyes.
Such tenderness in them and humour, too.
I must be careful, or I'll be falling in love with him myself.
I shan't allow that.
The toast!
- What a terrible smell!
- I'm so sorry.
Never mind. I'll go down for some more bread.
Frau Lang won't mind.
I wish it had been me.
- Thank heaven you're safe.
- Father.
What happened to that woman?
I'm afraid she got away from me soon after you'd gone.
I tried to follow but lost track of her in the dark.
- How did you fare?
- I went to the chateau.
You remember when you wrote to me asking me to come here?
You told me of your suspicions about the Baron and his mother.
- I do indeed.
- They were well founded.
The Baroness had become the victim of her own son.
- Oh, no.
- She's dead now and at peace.
God rest her soul.
But her son escaped with the girl.
My son, we have a great deal to thank you for already...
...but I'm afraid your work is not yet finished.
Must be tired. You should have some food.
I'll join you presently.
Is it well and truly boiling?
- Straight out of the kettle, doctor.
- Good. That's fine.
Might have been chest...
...bronchitis or pneumonia.
You never know.
Extract of Benzoin.
Yes, tincture of myrrh.
Only want a drop of that.
Just a drop.
Yes, liquor of capsicum, plenty of that. Ad lib.
Now, my very good woman, the towel.
Right, right over my head.
Don't you pay any attention to anything I may say.
Here we go.
My very dear, kind Frau,
I can't breathe. You're killing... Mercy.
I can't breathe!
Very well, there you are.
What the devil?
I told you not to pay any attention to anything I said.
- Let's have another try, shall we?
- You see off to yourself, thank you.
I've got my living to earn.
What we doctors have to put up with.
First it's you clericals, father...
...with your monolithic superstitions.
Then peasants like her with their troglodyte indifference.
Of course, she may have died of heart failure.
I mean the heart may have just...
...slowed down and stopped.
That's clearly a case for nux vomica.
Or perhaps it galloped itself to a standstill.
In that case, digital.
And of course, always and all the time...
...valerian to quiet my nerves.
I wish I haven't drunk you out of house and home.
But if the patient is dead, what's the use of all these concoctions?
Precaution is better than cure, father. By doing this...
...I have survived a vast number of other people's deaths.
I mean to survive a great many more.
- But who's dead?
- One of the young girls at the Academy.
She died quite suddenly in the night.
Dr. Tobler, this is Dr. Van Helsing.
Are you sure it is one of the pupils and not one of the staff?
That I can't say.
Doctor, if you're going to see her...
...it would be better for you to take Dr. Van Helsing with you.
He's one of the most eminent medical men in Europe.
- Would you come for nothing?
- Certainly.
Splendid.
I might put your specialist's fee on my own little account.
Worth trying, anyhow.
Would that be all right with you?
- Why not?
- Thank you. Shall we go then?
Thank you.
- You say the door was locked?
- Yes, on the inside...
...but the window was open.
- Open?
- Yes.
We found her lying on the bed.
What did she die from?
- I'm not sure.
- But I must know.
Such a thing, if we can't say what it is...
- ...might mean ruin for us.
- I shall have to make a further examination.
Perhaps you and Frau Lang will leave us.
What should we make the verdict?
Have you ever seen anything like this?
- That's a bite, isn't it?
- Have you ever seen it before?
Very seldom.
Once or twice in the forest villages.
You know, that's probably a pet animal, a dog or a cat.
The villagers fondle 'em, you know.
It's a very unhealthy practice.
We can't stop 'em.
This is the mark of a vampire, sometimes called the seal of Dracula.
- See how it cuts through the vein?
- A vampire?
No, I'm afraid not.
Well, the peasants are always going about...
...all about werewolves and vampires.
I'm a scientist.
- I always laugh at those ridiculous legends.
- I shouldn't if I were you.
I don't want these people to know it.
You'll leave everything to me?
By all means,
I'll leave everything to you.
Except the fee, of course.
- Her death was due to a fever.
- Yes, a fever.
It is very contagious. I've locked the door to her room. Here's the key.
What else must we do?
The undertakers came this morning.
They'll be back again tomorrow.
Now listen, these are my instructions.
Are there any outbuildings here?
- The stables, of course.
- Good.
Let her lie there in her coffin until the burial.
No, Dr. Van Helsing, the poor dear child...
Two responsible people...
...must keep watch over the coffin until nightfall.
I'll be back by then.
In the meantime, you must lock the house, keep all the doors and windows shut...
....and let none of your pupils be alone at any time.
- Is that understood?
- Of course.
We can organize this right away.
Excuse us, doctor.
Marianne will see you out.
Come, Helga.
I'm so sorry, my dear.
All this upset, so soon after your arrival.
But don't let it spoil your personal happiness.
- Have you told Dr. Van Helsing?
- Helga.
Coming, dear.
May I have a glass of wine?
- Did you have something to tell me?
- You have been so kind to me.
I would like you to know
I am engaged to be married.
I'm so very happy for you.
Congratulations.
- May I know who is the lucky man?
- The Baron Meinster.
- What?
- What is the matter?
- He has been here?
- Yes.
- Did you let him kiss you? Tell me, please.
- Only my hand.
Why do you do that?
- Are you in love with him?
- Yes, I am.
I see.
- Aren't you going to wish me well?
- Of course.
- When are you seeing him again?
- I am not sure.
Tomorrow, I hope.
- Are you ready, Dr. Tobler?
- Of course. Coming.
- If only they'd keep quiet.
- Saw a poor young lady yonder.
No horse can abide a corpse nearby.
Marianne!
I have come to see if I may relieve you till Dr. Van Helsing comes.
Oh, have you really, my dear?
How kind of you.
I won't say no.
Oh dear, I'm almost as jumpy as those poor horses.
- Good night, Severin.
- Good night, madam.
- Thank you again, Marianne. Good night.
- Good night.
- Admiring the brasses?
- You keep them so bright and clean.
You know, all these remind me of the seasons of the year.
This set here...
...reminds me of spring in the...
Picnics, bathing in the streams...
- ...drying in the sunshine.
- And that?
Autumn.
Gypsies...
...galloping along grass ridges in the roads...
...fine boys, fine girls.
- And this?
- Winter.
Look at that now.
You and I...
...sleep sound in a nice simple coffin of elm or oak.
They have to have cedar and all this brasswork.
It's locked.
This one is tight enough.
Severin, will you please go and fetch Herr Lang?
- I will if you wish it.
- I do wish it. Please.
Well then, but I warn you he won't like it.
Pay no heed to the horses.
Stop, will you?
Marianne, my darling Marianne.
You haven't forgotten your little Gina?
Put your arms around me, please.
I want to kiss you, Marianne.
Please be kind to me.
Say that you forgive me for letting him love me.
We can both love him, my darling.
He's up at the old mill now.
We can go there together.
Come with me, Marianne.
- Bring some brandy and hot water.
- Yes, doctor.
Marianne...
...did you see who it was?
- It was dreadful.
- You know, don't you?
She looked exactly like Gina...
- ...except...
- It was Gina.
- But it couldn't have been. She's dead.
- Gina is now an undead.
She is the third victim since the Baron was set free.
- The Baron? You mean the Baron Meinster?
- I do.
Oh, no. I won't listen to you....
You must know I wouldn't say such a thing unless I was absolutely sure.
I've got to find him, Marianne.
Do you know where he is?
- No.
- Where is he, Marianne?
If you know, you must tell me.
Marianne, where is he? Tell me.
The mill. The old windmill.
Marianne, wear this rosary.
It will protect you.
And when I'm gone,
I beg you to lock yourself in...
...and answer the door to no one.
You must obey me in this.
- Look after her.
- Yes, doctor.
Go on, catch him.
Obey your master, take him.
Take him!
I brought someone to see you,
Van Helsing.
Beautiful, isn't she?
What a pity such beauty was to fade...
...unless we preserve it.
She's going to join us, doctor and you are going to watch her initiation.
- Marianne, don't look at his eyes.
- Marianne, look at me.
Marianne!
Well, that's a novelty, your refusing anything with alcohol in it.
I'm not used to seeing you sober this time of day.
If you're trying to humiliate me, you did that years ago.
Everybody knows I drink.
I don't try to hide it.
Drinking and my feelings for you are both bad for me.
I know that.
What can I do?
I can't reach you without crawling into the bottle.
When I'm there,
I can at least pretend that you love me and that our marriage is what a marriage is supposed to be.
It's interesting to watch a bottle baby defend her weakness.
One thing I can say for you, your approach is always different.
Today it's complete submissi髇.
I can't even get a rise out of you.
You know, I think I like you better when you're sloppy drunk and violent.
That's the real you and that's the one I like, the one that hates me and gives me a chance to hate back.
Ah!
Now, that's when we're at our best, when we cut through the superficial surface and get down to the fact that we're a cruddy pair.
The only difference is
I know what I am, and you...
You try to hide what you are in the fumes of whiskey.
Did you say whiskey?
Here's to you, whiskey, the guardian of all frustrated wives.
Now, be a good girl and take your guardian and go home.
I've got some experimenting to do.
You know I don't like to be distracted when I'm working.
Unless, of course, you've changed your mind about helping me with my experiments.
You need more than me to be successful in whatever you do.
Just go on butchering your guinea pigs.
They can't put you in jail for that.
As a doctor, I resent the word "butchering" almost as much as I resent looking at you.
I don't know why you came here today, but whatever it was, speak up and then get out!
You know something?
I've just decided to do you a big favor.
I'm going to give you that divorce, so you won't have to look at my face any longer.
I tried making it over for you.
Plastic surgery can't bridge that 10 years between us.
Only love could make you look at me differently, and you never had that, not even in the beginning.
You're...
You're getting sloppy.
Another couple of drinks and you're liable to forget about the divorce and we'll be right back where we started from.
Go on home.
Call Neil and tell him to start the proceedings.
Tell him to use any grounds, whatever he wants.
Just let him get on with it.
You've got what you want.
Why can't I have a little one for the road?
Just enough to make me numb.
I think that did it.
I can't feel anything, inside or out.
I beg your pardon.
Doctor, there's someone in the office to see you.
That's all right, Sally.
Mrs. Talbot was just leaving.
Yes, l...
I was just leaving.
Finally.
Well, I know you advertised for old women, but the one in the office looks like she came right out of a mummy's tomb.
There's something peculiar about her.
She gives me the creeps.
Old women always give me the creeps, but remember, it's worth millions if I can ever find a way to make them young again.
Shall I show her in?
Yes, but first get rid of that glass and that bottle.
Neil?
I'm on my way home now.
Can you meet me there in about 30 minutes?
No.
No.
No, everything's the same.
I'm afraid it's all over.
Yeah.
Goodbye.
Mrs. Talbot, you will never divorce your husband.
You won't have to. He will die.
His death will give you life, a new way of life.
You may run away but you're gonna never escape me.
You are the one in my dreams of blood.
There. That's all.
It's remarkable.
Corpuscle count, blood pressure, teeth, all indicate extreme old age.
Would you help her up?
I'd be tempted to believe you if you had a birth certificate.
That is my birth certificate.
The brand of the Arab slaver who stole me and my mother from Africa, and sold us across the sea
140 years ago.
140 years ago?
I was more fortunate than most.
My mother comforted me.
I learned much from her, things that you'd want to know.
What things?
When we are alone,
I will speak.
Sally, would you mind?
Now, what did you learn from your mother that you think could be of value to me?
I am of the Nando people who once lived in Tanganyika, beyond the Kalambo Falls.
I thought they were all dead, but now I hear that many of my tribe still live deep in the wilderness.
I want to go to them.
You will give me the money to go.
And why should I do that?
Are you not trying to find a way to make the old young again?
Only to make them younger.
Nothing can reverse the aging process.
Nothing that you would know about.
Help me down, please.
This is all that remains of my inheritance, a few pinches of the life-giving Nipe my mother left me.
Nipe? What is it?
I don't know.
All that I know is that it has kept me alive many years beyond my time.
And if I would be young again,
I must return to my people.
Are you saying this powder will make you young again?
No. That slows the approach of death.
There is another substance that must be mixed with it to make one young.
I don't know what it is. It's the secret of the high priest of Nandos.
I'm a man of science.
I don't pay for mumbo jumbo.
I won't take any more of your time.
You can get your coat.
Then return the Nipe.
There are other scientists.
One might even ask for a demonstration before he tells me to go.
A demonstration?
Get me a glass of water.
Now we must wait a few minutes and then you can examine me again.
Then you will see for yourself if the Nipe hasn't slowed the aging process.
All right. I'll run the tests again.
If this powder does as you say, you'll have all the money you need to return to your people.
Mrs. Talbot, I know this is painful, but it's one of those things that have to be done when you plan a divorce.
Now, you and Paul own everything jointly.
Is that right?
Then let's start with the furniture.
Could you set a value on it?
It's trash. Everything's trash.
It'll make a difference to you later on, believe me.
Nothing makes a difference.
It's all old trash.
Like me. Old trash.
I think you've had it for tonight.
You get some sleep.
No.
I'll take you up to your room.
No, I don't want you to go.
Mrs. Talbot, please...
Don't, please don't leave me alone.
Mrs. Talbot.
No, no.
You know something?
You know what she said?
She said, "You are the one in my dreams of blood."
That's what she said.
I'm gonna get you a doctor.
No.
You're drinking yourself into the DTs.
No, I don't want...
Now, come on.
I don't need a doctor.
Sit down here while l...
I don't want a doctor.
Neil, I'm glad you're here.
You're just the man I wanted to see.
Well, since I'm representing your wife, don't you think it would be more ethical if you got another attorney?
What for?
Your divorce.
Divorce? Who said anything about a divorce?
Come, both of you. Let's go to the bar.
I've got a story to tell you that's fantastic.
Come on, June, sit down.
You're looking at the most powerful concentrate of hormone known, a hormone that retards aging.
Now, a similar hormone was first discovered in insects by a British biologist
20, 25 years ago.
Common silkworm produces it.
The only trouble with that hormone is it works only in insects.
This works in humans.
It's kept a woman living more than twice her normal span of life.
She's 152 years old, Neil.
She was in my office this afternoon.
152 years old?
I've confirmed it.
Where did she get this?
A plant that comes from Africa.
Now, she also mentioned another substance which, when mixed with this, will actually make old people young again.
Paul, you talk as if you believe this were possible.
I do. Enough to go to Africa to try to find the source.
June, I want you to come with me.
That is, if you can forgive all those awful things I said to you this afternoon.
June, I need you. You've got to help.
I can't do it alone.
You mean you don't want a divorce?
Of course not.
I'll make it all up to you.
What an idiot I've been not to realize how important you are to me.
Just think.
The trip together, the new country, the jungle, it'll be so exciting.
Oh, Paul. You're my life.
You've just pulled me out of the bottom of the pit.
Honey, if you ever let me go again, it'll be the end of everything for me.
Darling, don't think of such things.
Just think of our being together and how much I love you.
Yes, I know of the Nando people.
They're a savage, proud race.
They refuse to accept anything from our so-called civilization.
They have an undying hatred for Europeans.
The government has issued orders to respect their territory and leave them strictly alone.
So I was told at the consulate.
Then why come to me?
I've heard you're a gambler.
What a great gamble.
If I don't get killed by the Nandos,
I lose my license as a guide, so what's to win?
$5,000 now and $20,000 more if I find what I'm after.
Doctor, that's a lot of money, but I'm afraid I cannot do anything for you.
No one can.
How do you know what I'm looking for?
It's obvious.
You haven't said a word about guns or wildlife and you're not the first scientist to ask me about the Nandos.
That can only mean one thing, Doctor, the legend that they have a secret process to retard age.
Dr. Talbot, as much as I would enjoy earning your money,
I cannot help you find something which doesn't exist.
I'm not asking for your advice or opinion.
I'm merely seeking your services as a guide.
Your insistence does not impress me, but your money is most persuasive.
Doctor, you've got yourself a guide.
Now, come to think of it, about three days ago an old Nando woman came through here and hired bearers to carry her back to her tribe.
Did you see her?
No. She was in a litter behind curtains.
Never showed herself.
But I heard she was old.
Very old.
Must be Malla.
Do you know her?
Yes, yes.
And if we could overtake her,
I'm sure we could get a friendly introduction to her people.
Well, that means starting at once and traveling fast.
Take a look. See them?
Now, that's the Kalambo.
We'll cross over and make for the falls.
Now, we should be right about...
Right about there?
That's right. Another half-day's journey will bring us to the falls, right here.
We'll cache most of our supplies there and leave Ladu with a guard.
The rest of the carriers we'll send back.
We three go on.
Well, have a good night's rest.
Good night.
Ladu.
Another long day tomorrow.
You'd better get some sleep.
Are you angry with me?
Should I be?
You haven't been civil to me since we started this trek.
June, don't start imagining things.
I don't have to.
This time I know it's not my fault.
I've done everything I could to please you, and still you avoid me.
You seem to take a sadistic pleasure out of making me miserable.
Don't leave me like a wounded animal to suffer.
You're gonna tell me why you've been acting like this.
Look, I didn't ask to come along here with you. This was your idea.
Now, you tell me why you're torturing me.
I wasn't aware that I was torturing you. I'm sorry.
Sorry's not enough.
I'm leaving tomorrow with the carriers,
Paul. I mean it.
June, June.
You can't do that.
You don't know how important you are to me.
Why, you... Your leaving would spoil everything.
Why can't you always be like this?
I love you so much, Paul.
There's nothing in the worid
I wouldn't do for you.
Paul, I'd even die for you.
What good would that do?
I want you to live for me.
We'll work together and when we discover the Nandos' secret of rejuvenation,
I'll make you young again.
You'll be beautiful.
Just as beautiful as you were when we first met.
How stupid I've been.
Of course
I'm important to you.
And you really do need me, don't you?
Where else would you get a guinea pig who can talk?
Who can tell you how she feels?
How desperate I must have been to listen to your lies.
And believe them!
June, June...
You keep your hands off of me!
I'll see you dead before I let you touch me again.
Ladu. Where'd she go?
Go get her.
Bring her back.
What's the matter?
It's June. She's run off.
Now, now, now, now, it's all right.
Now, try and get hold of yourself.
Look, the leopard's killed and you are safe.
Come. Come.
There's only one trouble with running away.
You always meet yourself when you get there.
Now, come on.
Let's get back to camp. Come.
I think we'd better take a look.
Get your gun.
Ladu.
Hey, what's that?
It's Malla's.
She had this cane in my office.
Ladu.
Nandos.
Looks as though your friend Malla met a welcoming committee.
Yes, but her body isn't here.
What worries me is why these bodies are still here.
There are plenty of hyenas and vultures around.
What do you mean?
Something's been frightening the scavengers away.
Ladu?
Ladu.
Ladu.
Ladu.
Ladu!
I think we'd better get back to camp.
Ladu.
Ladu.
What do we do now?
I don't think we're going to have much choice.
That man isn't alone.
We'd be dead already if he wanted to kill us.
Give me your gun.
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm all right.
They're working themselves up for something.
Maybe we're the "something."
You don't know how right you are.
I think we're about to have company.
It's Malla.
She'll help us. You'll see.
I hope you're right.
We'll need it.
Dr. Talbot, we meet again.
I've been expecting you.
Then tell your people to set us free.
We're not here to do harm to anyone.
I've come to help...
I know why you've come.
You're searching for the source of the sacred Nipe.
I will show it to you.
An orchid.
A species that grows only in this region of Africa.
Look, the pollen.
A rare plant.
It takes years to harvest even a few ounces of the pollen.
Then it is aged five years more.
That flower, the plant, they're still alive.
It is too valuable to destroy.
I must have it.
For that one plant and permissi髇 to go,
I'll give your people whatever they want, money, cattle, guns, anything.
Why in such a hurry to depart?
Didn't I tell you that there was even a greater secret?
Don't you want to see me made young again?
Of course I do, but I never dreamed it could be possible.
I came here to die, Dr. Talbot, but before the old women of Nandos die, they receive the final gift of youth again, a few days of happiness and love before they wither to dust.
You're a scientist.
The greatest gift that I could give you would be to let you witness this.
Yes. If I could see it,
I would believe it.
Tonight, you, your wife and guide will share the Nando secret.
Then you will sell me the orchid and let us go.
For you, white men, and you, white woman, you are about to witness that which none other than the Nandos has ever seen before.
For a man, old age has rewards.
If he is wise, his gray hairs bring dignity and he's treated with honor and respect.
But for the aged woman, there is nothing.
At best, she's pitied.
More often, her lot is of contempt and neglect.
What woman lives who has passed the prime of life that would not give her remaining years to reclaim even a few moments of joy and happiness, and know the worship of men?
For the end of life should be its moment of triumph.
So it is with the aged women of Nandos, a last flowering of love and beauty before death.
He's drugged.
He's lanced the pineal gland deep in the cerebellum.
He's adding the pineal hormone to the Nipe.
It's a trick.
It's another woman.
No, no, it's Malla.
It's impossible.
It can't be the same woman.
I believe it is.
They took a man's life to do it.
Now you have seen the secret of the Nandos as I promised.
How do we know you're Malla?
Do you remember the mark of the Arab slaver that I showed you in your office?
I knew I was right.
Malla, you've got to help me take your secret back to the States.
It is the one secret that will never leave my people.
When I die, you, too, shall die.
Enjoy the night while you can.
Until morning, I grant anything you may wish, save freedom.
Malla, could you make my wife young again?
Yes, but she must choose the man for the sacrifice.
I could never do that.
Think well before you refuse an opportunity as rare as this.
I will be outside.
When you have made your decisi髇, call me.
June, you've got to do this for me.
If you can divert their attention, we may get a chance to escape.
We could get help and come back for you.
You mean you'd actually leave me here?
But, darling, Garvay and l can be back tomorrow, now that he knows the exact location.
I see what you mean.
Malla?
I'm ready.
Come, choose a man for the sacrifice.
You have your choice.
Any man I wish?
Any man.
Then I choose him.
June.
You have made an excellent choice.
You will have beauty and revenge at the same time.
Mrs. Talbot, now that Malla has given you the precious gift of youth,
I think it only fitting you show your appreciation and give her your beautiful gold necklace.
Don't you remember?
The expensive gold necklace you asked me to keep safely for you?
Oh, yes, I remember.
Malla, would you accept this gift from me?
Since vanity has no regard for time,
I will wear your necklace.
Garvay knows exactly where it is.
May he bring it here?
Malla.
Malla?
Mmm-hmm.
Malla.
Is it true?
Here. Look.
I'm young.
I'm young again.
Yes, and you're going to stay young.
We're getting out of here.
Come with me.
Get out there.
Your youth will not last long.
Do not waste it.
This night is yours.
The coming day brings you death.
Enjoy it well, both of you.
June.
Come on. Quiet.
Come sit down.
We're safe as long as we stay away from the river's edge.
Do you know where we're going? Mmm-hmm.
Yes, I do.
The river runs north all the way to Lake Victoria.
That's where the railroad is.
It will take us quite a while to get there.
Look at them.
And Malla said it wouldn't last.
You know, David, sometimes I can't sleep at night, thinking of the way I was.
I'd rather die than go back to that.
There won't be any going back.
I took care of that.
Young lady, you're in the company of a man who's going to be very rich once we get back.
I have here the elixir of sudden wealth and beauty.
You got away with them.
Wasn't that the whole purpose of the expedition?
David?
David! You've got to help me.
June!
June, no!
I need help.
June, take your hands off me.
Help me!
June, don't touch me.
Give me the Nipe.
Don't touch me.
I want the Nipe!
June, get...
Give me the Nipe!
Get away from me!
David! Don't leave me!
David!
David, please don't leave me!
David!
David, don't leave me!
I can't get out!
Help me out!
I'm sinking, June!
Give me the leather pouch.
Help me out first!
I'll give you the leather pouch!
You give me the leather pouch first.
June!
Help me! June, come on, quick.
I can't get out! Hurry up!
What're you waiting for?
June, what's the matter? June!
All right!
All right, here. Grab on.
Pull, June!
Pull more!
Little more! Little more!
That must be June's plane now.
What an awful thing to go through.
She was crazy about the doctor and he treated her just terribly.
Maybe he had the right idea.
It sure worked for him.
Well, don't you try anything like that if you wanna stay in one piece.
Do you see her?
No.
That's funny.
Her wire said flight 16.
Maybe she missed the plane.
Are you Neil Foster?
Yes.
I beg your pardon, but have we met?
No.
How do you know my name?
Mrs. Talbot described you in detail.
I'm her niece,
Terry Hart.
Well, how do you do?
Your aunt never mentioned you.
Is she with you?
No, June came down with the flu.
But she...
She asked me to come ahead and open up the house and get things ready.
Oh, you'll...
You'll be staying with her?
Yes, now that she's alone.
Oh, would you mind getting my luggage for me?
Then we can go.
Of course. Glad to.
I'm Sally Howard.
I used to work for your uncle.
Yes, I know.
Then your aunt described me to you, too.
Yes, she did.
Then she told you that Neil and I are engaged.
No, she didn't mention it.
Why should she?
Oh, I don't know.
Just thought I'd mention it.
That's everything.
Oh!
Thank you.
I hope you'll be comfortable.
Thank you.
If you need anything, why, just call me at the office.
All right.
Goodbye, Miss Hart.
Goodbye.
Neil?
Yes?
Do you know where my aunt keeps the liquor?
The liquor?
Mmm-hmm.
Yes.
She keeps it under the bar.
What'll you have?
Well, you're the bartender.
How about a little vodka over ice?
That's fine.
Only there isn't any ice.
Next time you come, there will be.
To your new home.
Cheers.
I better go.
Thanks.
Just one more thing.
Yes?
Would you mind taking my bags upstairs?
No, glad to.
Which room?
Put them in my aunt's room for now. I...
I don't know what room I'll be using.
All right.
It's a little stuffy in here.
It's been...
It's been closed up for so long.
There. That's better.
She's getting impatient. I...
I'd better go.
Sally is outside, waiting.
She has years to wait.
My time is much shorter.
What?
I can't explain that.
You think I'm attractive?
You know you are.
And perhaps a little aggressive?
I don't know you well enough to answer that.
Would you like to?
Uh-huh.
Get out of here.
What?
Get out! Go!
Terry! Listen!
Terry! Terry, what's wrong?
Terry!
Just go.
Terry, are you all right?
Yes, I'm all right.
Just go.
I don't think an explanation will help. Do you wanna try?
No, l... I don't.
I had a drink with Terry and took her bags upstairs.
Look, her aunt's an important client and a good friend.
I... I couldn't just run out.
Now, don't start imagining things.
Yes?
Mrs. Talbot?
Yes, of course.
June.
Why didn't you call me?
I could've met you at the airport.
I didn't want to bother you.
I... I can't tell you how sorry I was to hear about Paul.
Let's not talk about that.
It's been a nightmare.
Please sit down.
Now what can I do for you?
I want to hear all about your trip...
Shocking, isn't it, what three months of tragedy can do to a woman?
June, I'm...
I'm sorry.
Well, I didn't come here for sympathy.
I need money until Paul's insurance can be settled.
Why, of course. Will $500 be enough for the time being?
$5,000 would be better.
Miss Gregg, will you make out a check for Mrs. Paul Talbot for $5,000? Thank you.
Now, may I please have my jewelry?
Certainly.
It's right here.
June, if there's anything I can do for you, please don't hesitate to call.
Thank you. I appreciate that.
Oh, l... I almost forgot.
Thank you for being so kind to my niece.
She'd... She'd like to see you again, if you have time.
I had a different impressi髇.
I know. She told me of her awful behavior to you.
She'd like you to excuse her.
She's... She's gone away somewhere to brood.
When will she be back?
Tonight, I hope.
If not, she may never return.
I don't understand.
If I see Terry, would you like me to tell her to call you here?
Yes, no matter what time it is.
I... Well, I want to know if she's safe.
Thank you for being so concerned.
I know she'll appreciate it.
Oh, I'll pick up the check on my way out.
Oops!
Lady, I'm sorry.
Let me pick it up, lady.
I just wanna find out if I can bend over without falling down.
You're carrying quite a wad, lady.
It ain't safe in this part of town.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
Are those real rocks, lady?
Mmm-hmm.
May I buy you a drink?
No, thanks.
I'm on the wagon.
You like music, honey?
Mmm-hmm.
Real hot music?
Isn't this a beautiful view?
Yeah.
Just like Tiffany's.
You dig young guys, honey?
I like young men very much.
Sure you do.
Where do you come from, honey?
Does that matter?
I'm here now.
Yeah.
Got any relatives?
No, I'm all alone.
Nobody to worry about you or miss you, huh?
No. That's why I appreciate your company so much.
That's nice.
You married?
I was once. He's dead now.
That's too bad.
Yes.
He was like you in so many ways.
How's that, honey?
He was so understanding of older women.
So considerate.
I'm very understanding of you, honey.
Especially in all this beautiful jewelry that you're wearing.
Sally! What are you doing here?
Well, it would be more to the point if I asked you, considering we had a date two hours ago.
I... I'm sorry.
I... I forgot.
Is that all you have to say?
Well, l... I got to working on some briefs, you know.
Oh, yes, you've been working.
Very interesting work.
All right, l... I won't lie to you,
I was waiting for a phone call.
From Terry?
Sally!
Sally!
Hello?
Terry. Your aunt had me worried.
Are you all right?
Sure, I'll be there as soon as I can.
In about an hour.
All right.
Goodbye.
Come in.
The door's unlocked.
All set for a lovely evening, aren't you?
Champagne, soft music...
Very nice.
You don't miss a trick.
I try not to.
Now, why don't you be a good little girl and go on home?
You wouldn't want Neil to find you here like this, would you?
That's for sure, but you missed the most important thing.
I wouldn't want Neil to find you.
So you're coming with me.
I'm putting you on the next plane to New York.
Don't be ridiculous.
Now, why don't you get out of here and leave me...
This is a most persuasive little instrument, and if you don't want me to use it, you'd better hurry.
You don't mind if I take my purse along, do you?
And I'll need a coat.
It's in the hall closet.
Get it.
You're being awfully foolish, you know.
Even if I did go, I could always come back.
By that time, Neil and I'll be on our honeymoon.
You know, you can get in an awful lot of trouble this way,
Iittle giris that play with guns.
I... I told Sally how I feel about you.
She didn't take it very well.
Everybody can't win.
I'm just lucky that you want me.
I'm the lucky one.
Just thinking about you is exciting.
If this is love,
I never loved Sally.
Terry, will you marry me?
No, Neil, I can't.
Why not?
There are reasons.
What reasons?
Don't you love me?
Well, it's because I love you
I can't marry you.
Now, let's not get so serious.
Let's enjoy each other while we can.
There's no time like the present, you know.
I'll get it.
Yes? What is it?
Police.
Mrs. Paul Talbot in?
No, she isn't. She's spending the night with friends.
What's the trouble?
Mind if I look around?
Now, just a minute.
This is a private residence.
Unless you have a search warrant.
This do?
Neil, make them go away.
I'm afraid he has the right to be here.
This is a search warrant.
Officer, I'm
Mrs. Talbot's attorney.
If she's in any trouble,
I have a right to know about it.
Did I say anything about trouble?
If I knew what Mrs. Talbot is accused of, maybe I could... Maybe I could help.
She isn't accused of anything.
We just want her for questioning about a murder.
Murder?
That's impossible.
Just doesn't figure.
Woman who owns a house like this getting mixed up with a guy like Jerry Lando.
Who's he?
Small-time con man.
He was found murdered in his car earlier tonight.
He was seen in the presence of an elderly lady.
There are witnesses.
Witnesses that could identify Mrs. Talbot?
No need to. Lando had her calling card in his pocket.
This address.
Mrs. Paul Talbot.
This is unbelievable.
Well, maybe...
Maybe he kidnapped her.
Well, we won't know till we find her.
Lando probably planned to rob her.
That was his specialty.
She got the drop on him.
He was killed with a peculiar sharp instrument.
My aunt couldn't do a terrible thing like that.
Your aunt?
Funny.
There was a murder exactly like this one a week ago.
Then it couldn't have been Mrs. Talbot.
A week ago she was in New York.
So was the murder.
Joe, I guess we'd better exercise that search warrant.
See if there's anybody upstairs.
Right.
The witnesses said your aunt was wearing a large diamond necklace tonight.
Oh, well, that proves it.
Mrs. Talbot's diamonds are right here.
Neil.
All that proves is that your aunt's been here since the murder.
All right, where is she?
Well, l...
I don't know.
Anyone upstairs, Joe?
Nobody up there.
I won't let you search this house in my aunt's absence.
Sorry, miss.
Get away. Get away. No!
No, don't open that door! Don't! Don't...
No.
She tried to kill me!
I had to kill them!
It was my only chance to stay young!
We really did find the secret of...
Rejuvenation.
I'll show you. I'll show you.
I'll become beautiful again.
I'll show you.
Come on, open up!
It's not working.
I killed Sally for nothing.
Hit it!
Oh! Oh!
No! No!
Extra, extra!
Read all about it!
Love slayer insane!
Lucy Harbin was declared legally insane today.
It all started on a hot, sticky Saturday night.
Lucy's husband, Frank Harbin, had gone to a roadside tavern
to meet a former girlfriend,
Stella Fulton.
His wife was away.
Frank was seven years younger than his wife.
He'd married her because she owned property.
But she didn't own him.
At least, that's what he kept telling Stella.
He persuaded the girl to leave with him.
Harbin's farm was just a short distance.
He took Stella there, knowing his wife was away,
and not expected to return until the following day.
Come on, baby.
Come on!
Come on.
Let's go in the house.
- I don't want to.
- Yeah, go on.
It'll be all right.
Come on.
There was no one else in the house but young Carol,
daughter of Frank and Lucy Harbin.
They made one mistake, in thinking that the child was asleep.
They made another mistake, too.
Frank's wife, Lucy,
had decided to come home on the evening train.
Lucy Harbin.
Born and raised on a farm.
Parents, poor.
Education, meagre.
Very much a woman, and very much aware of the fact.
All aboard!
Lucy's first husband had been an older man,
chosen by her parents.
When he died, she picked Frank herself.
At last, she had what she wanted out of life.
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
I'm not guilty! I'm not guilty!
I'm not guilty! I'm not!
It was a mistake!
No! No!
Oh, God, no!
No! No! No!
No!
My mother, a murderess.
And now you know.
Carol, don't you see?
It doesn't matter.
Uncle Bill and Aunt Emily adopted me, and they moved out here, where nobody knows who I am.
Michael, do you realise I haven't seen my mother for twenty years?
- The doctors wouldn't let me.
Carol?
- Carol.
- Yes, Aunt Emily?
Bill just called from the station.
- They'll be here in a few minutes.
- What's all this about?
- You say Bill's at the station?
- It's all right. He knows.
Bill went back to the Midwest, to talk to the doctors at the Institution.
They asked him to come.
They'd been sending reports.
- About Carol's mother?
- Yes.
They've been using some... some new methods of treatment.
And they thought perhaps she was ready to... well, to face the outside world again.
The outside world?
- You see, that's why I had to tell you.
My... my mother has been released.
From an asylum.
She's coming home.
Today.
There they are!
Now, Carol, don't you worry.
- Everything's going to work out just fine.
- I hope so.
Of course it will.
Why, after all these years, it'll be just like meeting a stranger.
I'll get it.
I'll, er... put these bags in your room.
Right in here.
I know she's dying to see you.
Come in, dear.
You see? Now you know where your eggs came from at breakfast.
I never thought my brother would end up running a farm again.
He started it right after we moved out here.
Twenty years ago.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
I just hate to see anything caged.
Oh, it's not for long.
We butcher them at sun...
Come on.
There's more to see.
That's Leo Krause.
He's the hired hand.
Not very tidy, is it?
But necessary.
You fatten them up for the slaughter.
Let's... let's look at the locker-plant, shall we?
No... no sense going inside.
It's just a big old deep freeze.
You sure are pretty.
Must be very lonely around here for someone like you.
Not at all.
I've lots of friends.
Come on.
I'll show you.
Won't you come in?
Well, what do you think?
This is what you do?
A sculptor?
Sculptress.
- You like it?
- Oh, yes.
I've been puttering around here for years.
Uncle Bill turned this guest house into a studio when I got out of school.
- Do you sell your work?
- Mm-hm. When I'm lucky.
Some of the art shops along the coast take my pieces, and Michael says
I should have an exhibition.
Michael?
You have a young man?
Yes. I didn't have a chance to tell you, but... well, we're practically engaged.
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not rushing into anything.
We haven't even told his parents yet.
You'll like the Fields.
You'll meet them soon, and...
Michael is coming to dinner tonight.
I'm not ready to meet strangers!
Not... not just yet.
He... he's no stranger.
Everyone's a stranger.
I almost forgot.
I have a surprise for you.
I hope you like it.
You made this?
You see, Mother?
I've... I've never forgotten.
- ls something the matter?
- Nn-nnn.
No, it... it's just such a wonderful surprise.
I think it's the best thing
I've ever done.
Oh, lam so proud of you.
And I'm proud of you.
I've changed, haven't I?
Twenty years.
It's a hell of a long time.
We all change, Mother.
Look what twenty years has done to me.
Pretty swell, I'd say.
I... I have something else
I want to show you.
Do you remember?
Where did you get those?
I... I saved them.
I still remember how they used to jangle, when you'd pick me up to kiss me good night.
And I saved this, too.
- Photograph album.
- Would you like to look at it?
- After a while.
- All right.
You know, I did some modelling, too.
Dr Anderson let me work with some clay in the hospital.
He says it's good therapy.
Mother!
Maybe we'd better go back to the house.
Come on.
Michael will be coming soon.
I won't be long.
Looks good, doesn't it?
Oh, Bill?
- Did you get out the ice cubes?
- All set!
- Bill? All right?
- That's perfect.
Mother, what do you think?
You look wonderful.
I'm talking about the flowers.
Oh, I forgot about the napkins.
Oh, the good ones.
They must be in the linen closet.
I'll get 'em, if I can fight off the moths!
- Isn't there something I can do to help?
- No, thanks.
I'll tell you what you can do!
You could fill the water glasses.
I'll get the pitcher for you.
- Where's Aunt Emily?
- Fixing her hair.
Here, now just fill it from the tap.
We'll get the ice cubes from Bill.
There's Michael!
- Everything all right?
- Of course.
Come on.
I've told her all about you.
She's dying to meet you.
Mother, I want you to meet Mi...
Well, she was just here.
It's all right, darling.
Mother's just a little shy.
You understand, don't you?
Well, perhaps she just stepped out for a moment.
I think I know where she is.
She's not here.
- What is it?
- Nothing. Just an old photograph album.
- Michael, I gave it to Mother...
- Carol, let me have it.
- I'm sorry about last night.
- But you were so right.
I understand why you didn't want to meet Michael.
After all, we girls have to look our best.
I'm not a girl any more.
But you will be, as soon as we finish shopping.
Just wait and see.
It's been so long since
I bought anything new.
Then it's about time you had a chance.
We really have some very nice little shops here.
Come on.
We're going to have some fun.
- Did it look all right?
- It looked wonderful on you.
Well, shall I wrap them up?
- Do you really think I should?
- Definitely. I think they're lovely.
Yes, but not very practical.
Look.
Just what I wanted.
I thought you'd like it.
Do you think these would go with my new outfit?
- Not that pair, this. Aren't they pretty?
- I think they're perfect.
We're spending an awful lot of money.
Don't be silly. We said,
"head to toe", remember?
Which reminds me: we've got one more stop to make.
Hurry, will ya?
I don't know. Don't you have to have an appointment to go to a beauty parlour?
It's all arranged, Morn.
You don't really think they can do anything with me?
- Of course they can.
- My hair's such a mess.
Well, I wasn't thinking of a permanent.
Oh, no, I... I couldn't.
But Mother, it's the latest thing.
Everybody wears them now.
But I'd feel so foolish.
Let's try it. Just for fun.
I just know it wouldn't be right for me.
Are you ready?
Hurry up. I can't wait.
How do you like it?
You look lovely.
Isn't she beautiful?
If you're sure it doesn't make me look too young...
You look just like you did twenty years ago.
Just as I've always dreamed of you.
Is that what you want?
That's what I've always wanted.
Things are going to be so wonderful for us from now on.
You'll see.
Lucy Harbin took an axe,
Gave her husband 40 whacks.
When she saw what she had done,
She gave his girlfriend 41.
# London Bridge is falling down
- # Falling down, falling down #
- ls there something wrong?
- I heard them.
- Heard what?
Those kids.
# My fair lady
# London Bridge is falling down #
It's only a nursery rhyme.
You're tired out. I'll get your things and we'll go home.
# My fair lady
# Take a key and lock her up

Lucy Harbin took an axe,
Gave her husband 40 whacks.
When she saw what she had done,
- She gave his girlfriend 41.
- No.
Lucy Harbin took an axe.
- Gave her husband 40 whacks.
- No!
When she saw what she had done,
She gave his girlfriend 41.
Lucy Harbin took an axe,
Gave her husband 40 whacks.
When she saw what she had done,
- She gave his girlfriend 41.
- No!
Lucy Harbin took...
...40 whacks. When she saw
what she had done, she gave his girlfriend 41.
Took an axe, took an axe, took an axe!
Bill!
Bill!
Bill!
Bill! Bill!
- Bill, Bill, Bill!
- What? What?
- Lucy, Lucy. Now, calm down.
- What happened?
- Help me, please!
- Lucy...
- Lucy, tell us what happened.
- Oh, Bill.
I... I saw them in my bedroom.
I... I really did.
But there's nothing to be afraid of.
Mother!
Are... are you all right?
That's what we're trying to find out.
Th... there was something in my bedroom.
- Let's... let's go look.
- No!
- Not you, you mustn't.
- We'll all go.
Come on.
Come on, Lucy.
Now, come on.
- Carol! Don't you go in that room.
- Lucy! Lucy!
No, she's right. I'll go.
There is nothing here.
Come on. Come on, and see for yourself.
There's nothing wrong.
Bu... bu... but, I saw...
Just what did you see, dear?
It... it was like a dream.
Oh, Mother...
Yes.
It... it must have been a nightmare.
Yeah.
Bill, I don't know.
Maybe you should put through a long-distance call to Dr Anderson.
There's no reason to make such a fuss about it, just because Mother had a bad dream.
Oh, everybody dreams, Emily.
Remember when Carol was a little girl, the way she used to wake up screaming?
- That's right.
- You're forgetting one thing.
- Lucy is not a child.
- Please.
If you only know how much it means to me to have my mother here with me again.
I know I can help her.
We can all help her.
Carol, are you sure you're doing the right thing?
Please, let's try it.
Just for her sake.
All right. All right.
You are the doctor.
And let's not have any more talk about doctors.
All Mother needs is just a little patience and understanding.
Bill, I can't help worrying.
You can just stop worrying, because it's over and done with.
I wish I could be sure of that.
Good mornin'.
What's the matter?
What you lookin' at?
I'm just butcherin' a chicken, that's all.
Sorry if I disturbed you, lady.
You didn't disturb me.
I was raised on a farm.
Maybe you'd like to... try it yourself?
Michael!
- Darling!
- Michael!
- Mmm.
- Well, this is a switch.
- What?
- Usually, the boy calls for the girl
- when they have a date.
- Don't you worry, we're going in my car.
Then why did you lure me out here?
I was hoping you'd stop in for a moment, and say hello.
- Mom and Dad haven't seen you for weeks.
- All right.
- Well, Carol. How's my girl?
- Fine.
- What do you mean, your girl?
- It's all in the family.
- Carol, how good to see you.
- Good to see you.
Well, come in.
Sit down.
- Can I get you something?
- No, thanks. We're on our way to the movies.
- We'll have dinner later.
- Glass of milk?
Oh!
You and your milk!
Why not?
I get it wholesale.
After all, it's my dairy.
What movie are you going to see?
We hadn't decided yet. There's a murder mystery down at the drive-in.
Nice and gory.
Pay no attention to him.
He has the instincts of a killer.
- Inherited from his mother, no doubt.
- Oh, Raymond!
And speaking of mothers, didn't I hear you had a visitor, Carol?
It's not a visit, really.
My mother has come home to stay.
- She lived back East, didn't she?
- That's right.
I hadn't seen her for twenty years.
- Twenty years, my.
- Carol's mother's been an invalid.
Oh! I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.
She's completely recovered now.
Just, er... what was her illness?
Dad, I hate to interrupt, but we'd better be going.
- Right, darling?
- Yes, if you'll excuse us.
Now, you promise to bring your mother over for dinner. We'd love to meet her.
Of course.
Thank you.
- Goodbye.
- See you soon.
Michael's really serious about her, isn't he?
If you ask me, they make a very handsome couple.
Did you notice how nervous she seemed when you started asking questions about her mother?
Why not?
It really isn't any of our business.
Anything that concerns
Michael is our business.
Why don't you have some milk?
Calm you down.
I'll feel a lot calmer after I find out a few things about Carol's mother.
You've been awfully quiet this evening.
You mad at me?
Not really.
I still think you should have let me tell them.
Let them meet your mother first, then we can tell them.
After they get to know her and see she's all right.
- She is all right, isn't she?
- Why don't you see for yourself?
I'm sorry. Michael... why don't you stop by for a drink tomorrow afternoon?
- He's late.
- Are you sure I look okay?
Of course you do.
Mother, I'm...
I'm so proud of you.
You've no idea how different you look.
Th... there's nothing to be nervous about.
I guess it's the... the record, and... oh, I don't know!
It's just like it was twenty years ago.
Look.
You promised, remember?
You don't talk about the past.
Only the future.
And I think my future has just arrived.
- Hi, sweet.
- Darling.
Bill and Emily won't be joining us.
They're getting ready to go out for dinner.
Come along.
She's waiting.
Well!
Hmm. You didn't tell me he was that good-looking.
Come on. I bet you could use a drink.
Now, don't tell me.
Let me guess. Um...
- Bourbon and water.
- Scotch on the rocks, please.
Oh, one of those!
- That'll be fine, thank you.
- Really?
Just a minute.
Well, Carol, I'd almost forgotten about you.
Your young man is quite a charmer.
Really, Mrs Harbin, I'm just a... country boy.
And I'm just a country girl.
You don't have to be so formal with me.
Why don't you just call me Lucy?
Mother!
- Carol, you want a drink?
- Nothing for me, thanks.
- But this is a celebration!
- No, thank you, Mother!
I'll tell you what.
You just come right over here, and you sit right down there with Carol, because you see, I wouldn't like my little girl to think
I was trying to take her fella away from her.
Michael, if you'd have seen her when she arrived, you wouldn't believe it.
Why, she's like a different person now.
- Hello?
Is this the Harbin residence?
Who?
Yes she is. Just a minute.
- Mother, it's for you.
- Who on earth...?
He didn't give his name.
Probably one of my secret admirers.
Hello?
Lucy? yes?
- Who is this?
- Dr Anderson.
- Where are you?
- In town.
I'd like to come and see you, Lucy.
You mean, now?
Yes, I'll be right out.
Mother, what is it?
- Why did you send for him?
- Who?
He just called from town.
He's on his way here, now.
Mother, what are you talking about?
Bill!
Bill!
Michael, I don't know what this is all about, but please believe me, she isn't like this.
Something's upset her.
Perhaps it would be better if I stopped back some other time.
No, Michael.
I'm sure it's nothing serious.
I think it would be better for you if I go.
Michael.
You do understand, don't you?
Of course, darling.
I'll call you later.
Did Emily send for him?
Lucy, please believe me, nobody sent for him.
- Well, then, what's he doing here?
- I don't know!
Look, are you sure that it was
Dr Anderson that you spoke to?
Don't you think I'd recognise that voice after listening to it for twenty years?
Well, stop worrying.
I'm going to try to find out what this is all about.
- You promise, Bill?
- I promise.
There. That's a girl.
- Good afternoon.
- Why, Dr Anderson.
You'll have to excuse my appearance.
I'm playing hookey.
- Well, you come right in.
- Thank you.
Driving up to Oregon on a fishing trip.
Thought I'd stop in on my way and say hello.
Oh, then the, er... the Institution didn't send you?
Oh, no.
No, it's not an official visit.
As long as I was in the neighbourhood,
I wanted to see how things are going.
Well, they're, er... they're all right, I guess.
Then it was you that Lucy spoke to on the telephone.
Yes, she seemed a little...
Lucy!
It's good to see you.
Why did you come here?
Oh, it's just a coincidence, really.
I was telling your brother.
Yes, I know.
I heard.
I have no secrets from you.
- Do I, doctor?
- I hope not.
Bill? I'm all ready.
Where are you?
We're going to be late if you don't...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Emily, this is Dr Anderson.
- Oh, Dr Anderson.
From... from Lucy's hospital?
- I hope I'm not intruding.
- Oh, no.
No, not at all.
Bill and I have a dinner engagement in Riverside.
- I'll just go and cancel it.
Please, not on my account.
I'll be running along in a few minutes, anyway.
- Doctor, perhaps we should...
- No, no. You two go ahead.
Lucy and I will visit.
Well, if you insist.
I do.
Nice seeing you, Mrs Cutler.
- Goodbye, Doctor.
- Have a good trip.
- Thank you, Bill.
- Emily.
I hope you'll be all right, Lucy.
Nervous?
Why don't you sit down?
All right, Lucy.
How are you?
- How do I look?
- Quite different.
Feel different, too.
When I look in the mirror, it's hard for me to believe that
20 years have passed.
But they have passed, Lucy.
You've got to remember that.
I don't want to think about it.
All that matters to me is now.
That's just what I'm talking about.
You can't turn back the clock.
Don't you approve of the way I look?
It's the way you feel... that's important.
The place is in such a mess.
We were entertaining here this afternoon.
Usually, it's very quiet.
Lucy?
How do you spend your time?
Knitting.
I... I... I do a lot of knitting.
Remember, they taught me that in therapy.
- What are you making?
- I don't know yet.
I have to find a pattern.
Lucy...
Ever feel lonely?
No.
Nn-nnn.
Um, you see, there's Bill and Emily and Krause. He works here.
I sometimes help him in the yard.
- What about your daughter?
- Oh, she's out back.
You two get along well together?
Oh, yes, she's been wonderful.
She brought her fiancé over to meet me this afternoon.
Why are you asking me all these questions?
Don't you believe me?
- I just want to be sure.
- Sure of what?
You can see I'm all right.
Lucy.
Oh, my knitting.
It's all unravelled.
It's coming apart.
Lucy... have you had any dreams?
Who told you about my dreams?
Who told you about my nightmares?
Who told you? No!
Leave me alone!
- Looking for somebody?
- Did Lucy... er, Mrs Harbin... happen to come out here just now?
- I ain't seen her.
- Thank you.
Where could I find her daughter?
Carol? I saw her go into her place a little while ago.
- Over there.
- Thank you.
Doctor, how is my mother?
I was hoping you might be able to answer that question.
That's very lovely.
- Have you finished with it?
- No, no. Not quite.
It's hard for an artist to tell when anything is finished.
It's hard for a doctor to tell, too.
Carol, I've known your mother for more than twenty years.
So have I.
You were only a little girl when she was sent away.
But you're wrong, Doctor.
There are some things you just don't forget.
That's true.
But that doesn't affect our relationship now.
It's just that, well,
I've never forgotten.
- Neither has your mother.
- What do you mean?
She's perfectly all right.
You released her.
Today I saw a different Lucy, a woman who's trying to look and act as if those 20 years had never existed.
A woman who's trying to recapture her past.
But for her, the past is dangerous.
Doctor, I...
I wanted to tell you.
It's probably all my fault.
She... she did it to please me.
I'm the one who suggested the clothes, and the wig, and...
Oh?
Well, you see, at first, when she came here, she was so depressed.
She didn't want to meet anyone.
Everything bothered her.
And I thought, if... well, if she was more confident about her appearance...
- Perhaps you made a mistake.
- But she is sane now.
- Isn't she?
- Sanity's a relative term.
The Board recommended your mother's release.
Frankly, I had my doubts.
So we decided to put her on probation.
When I took this vacation, the Board suggested I look in on her.
I wanted to test her reactions under stress.
Are you saying that my mother might...
With what I've seen today,
I feel there is a danger.
Something could happen that would trigger her.
- Please don't!
- You're right.
If the Institution sent someone out, it would only upset her.
- I'll take her back myself.
- But you're on a vacation!
That can wait.
I'd better tell her.
- Doctor?
- Yes?
You will make her understand, won't you?
I'll try.
Mother?
Mother?
Mother?
Give it to me.
My knitting. I dropped it.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
- Where were you?
- Right here in this chair.
Sitting in the dark?
I must have fallen asleep.
You've changed your clothes.
I can't wear them.
I've tried to do it.
Just to please you.
Carol, I'd do anything in the world for you, you must know that.
But I can't go back twenty years.
It's wrong.
You've got to understand.
When I put those clothes on, something happens to me.
Something... frightening.
- You... you saw the doctor?
- Yes.
What did he say?
Nothing.
You mean, he didn't tell you?
Tell me what?
Where... where is the doctor?
Well, he must have left hours ago.
His car!
Something wrong?
It... it's still outside.
Where is he?
- Where is he?
- The doctor's gone.
- Mother...
- The doctor's gone.
Mother!
- The doctor's gone.
- Tell me!
Oh, my God!
Okay, okay. I'm all set.
Well, hurry up, Bill. This load has to be in the freight office in 20 minutes.
The way egg prices are dropping, it hardly pays to bring 'em in.
Talk to the hens.
Maybe they'll organise a union.
Oh, is Carol up yet?
She's having coffee.
Drive carefully, Bill. Remember, they're not buying scrambled eggs.
Carol?
Carol?
- The doctor's car is gone.
- Yes, I know.
But that means everything's all right, isn't it?
Please. We're not going to talk about it.
But we've got to talk about it.
I have to tell you something.
- I don't want to hear it!
- But you've got to listen to me.
- Please!
- You let go of me!
Listen to me!
It's about the doctor!
I lied to you last night.
I didn't really see him go.
I was talking to him, and I ran outside.
He got me so upset.
I don't know.
The next thing
I remember was... sitting there in the darkness, when you came in.
I thought it was the doctor, coming to take me back to the hospital, so I hid in the corner.
Hello?
The Cutler residence?
- Yes, this is the Cutler residence.
Long distance calling.
Long distance?
What hospital?
Oh.
And you couldn't reach him at the fishing camp this morning?
Well, why did you call here?
Oh, I see.
He said he might stop here?
Well, perhaps he meant he'd stop on his way back.
No, I'm sorry.
Dr Anderson is not here.
Don't worry, Mother.
I won't let them take you back.
It's all right.
What are you doing?
What does it look like?
I'm painting my car.
Your car?
It's nice, huh?
Where did you get it?
Well, let's just say
I picked it up...
- Last night.
- Last night?
Ain't no law against a fella ownin' a car, is there?
Course there's laws against other things.
What are you talking about?
- You ask too many questions.
- I want the truth!
Hmph. Okay.
Okay.
This the kind of truth you're looking for?
You're fired.
Sure. Take the car and go.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Get out of here!
You want to tell me about the doctor first?
Never mind.
You don't have to.
I can guess.
Your mother's a looney, ain't she?
Come on, honey. Let's go!
Better run along, "honey".
I want you out of here before tonight.
No. I'm going to stay around a while...
"Honey."
Here.
Want to help me?
- Wish you'd tell me why you're so upset.
- I'm not upset.
It's just that I realise we mustn't announce our engagement now.
It wouldn't be fair.
- Fair to whom?
- Michael, you've got to think of your parents.
They've got such a big future planned for you.
- I'm thinking of our future.
- So am I.
But we've got to consider the way they feel.
Michael, your father's wealthy. He's got his position in the community to consider.
Is that the real reason?
Par': of it.
I think you'd better tell me the rest.
Hey, you still love me?
Yes, I love you.
Then, what's the matter?
Just that I love my mother too.
When we made our plans we didn't know she was coming back.
Michael, I've got to help her.
She needs so much love and affection.
It's going to take time.
If I deserted her now,
I'd never forgive myself.
- You saw how she was yesterday.
- She did seem a little...
You don't have to say it.
Your parents will.
Believe me, Michael.
They'll never accept her.
If they don't, we'll run off and elope.
Running away won't solve anything. I know.
I've been running away all my life... from that town we used to live in, kids who used to... make fun of me at school.
That's why we moved out here.
I can't run any more, not now.
Don't you see?
I'd be...
Well, I'd be running away from my mother.
- Just when she needs me the most.
- She needs to feel at ease.
Let me help you when you bring her to dinner tonight.
No. I don't think it would be wise for us to come.
My folks are expecting you.
Michael, it... it... it'd just be embarrassing.
For them, for Mother.
If anything went wrong,
I'd... I'd blame myself forever.
It's only a simple dinner just for the family.
I want to help your mother too.
The best way is for both of us to show her she is accepted.
- Do... do you really think we could?
- I'm sure of it.
Then you'd better take me home.
We'll have to get ready.
Remember, darling, we're expecting you at six.
Bill and Emily are coming too.
So don't you worry about a thing.
Bill, for heaven's sake, get out of the way.
Oh, come on, Emily.
We've got plenty of time.
- Where are Carol and Lucy?
- What?
What wrong with your ears?
I asked you where...
What's wrong with your eyes?
Was that my name I heard dropping just now?
- Yes.
- Just wondering if you were ready.
I was just about to get dressed. ls your mother ready yet?
I don't know. I was out with Michael.
Haven't you seen her?
No. We just got back a little while ago.
Hey, er, Carol.
Now that we're alone, how is Lucy?
Well, she seems perfectly all right.
What did the doctor say yesterday?
He said she's going to be just fine.
- Good.
- Lucy! Where have you been?
- I went for a walk.
- But you knew we had a date tonight.
- I'm not going.
- What?
I won't go.
I've made up my mind.
Perhaps she's right, Carol.
- If your mother feels she won't be comfortable...
- But they're expecting us.
Why don't we take a rain check on this whole deal?
- You run over there alone.
- But it's Mother they want to meet.
That's the whole reason for going, and Michael and I had it all planned.
But I don't want to make a spectacle of myself again in front of your young man.
How long do you think he'll be my young man if you keep acting like this?
Hiding in corners as if you were ashamed?
I'm not ashamed, Mother.
Don't you realise that?
Don't you realise how much tonight means to me?
- Oh, honey, I...
- Please, say you'll come.
For my sake.
- Emily, quit squirming.
- I can't help it.
What's the matter?
Your girdle too tight?
Bill!
I think it's exciting.
- We're going to have such rich relatives.
- Oh.
Hey, you two, why all the silence back there?
Well, just remember.
We're going to a party, not a funeral.
- Bill, do I look all right?
- Yeah, you look great.
Mother?
Mother?
I'm sorry, Carol,
- I... I just can't.
- Please, I need you now.
Let me out!
Come on, let me out of here!
I gotta get out!
I gotta get out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out! Let me out!
Here you are.
I think I got most of it out.
Thank you. You never can be sure about coffee stains.
Put it on.
I'm sure it won't show.
I'm sorry I made such a fool of myself.
How can I ever go back in there and face them?
Now, Mother, really.
There's no harm done.
People spill coffee every day.
- Come on. Put it on.
- But I'm so embarrassed.
I want so to make a good impression for your sake.
Mother, they realise it was just an accident.
They're such nice people.
They can tell I don't belong in a place like this.
I knew I shouldn't have come out here tonight.
Mother, it's just your imagination.
Oh, you're doing fine.
Just keep on talking, honey, will you'?
Come along.
Ahh.
How do you like this liqueur?
- Well, it tastes different.
- Yes, it probably does.
Oh, here you are.
We were getting worried about you. ls everything all right now?
- Yes, thank you.
- I want to apologise.
- Nonsense, it was nothing.
- Well, now, you're just in time.
Yes, Michael's going to show us the new addition to the dairy.
I thought Bill and Emily would like to see it.
- Carol, would you like to come along too?
- Sure.
I'll, er...
I'll come with you.
Now why don't you just stay here and be comfortable.
- Nothing exciting about visiting a cow barn.
- Good.
This will give us a chance to get acquainted.
Have fun.
Do sit down.
Is there something
I can get you?
No, thank you. I... I was just looking to see if this spot showed.
Your daughter did an excellent job.
They say cold water is very good if you use it right away.
It even works with bloodstains.
Now, there's a morbid little household hint for you.
- Raymond...
- Um, yes, dear.
There.
Now, we can talk.
Michael has told us quite a bit about you, Mrs Harbin.
- Has he?
- Mm-hmm.
- He's a charming boy.
- Well, we think so.
You know, I liked him the moment I saw him.
I'm so glad that he and Carol are going to be married.
Oh. Oh, I... I... I'm sorry.
I... I thought you knew.
I wasn't aware any decision had been made in the matter.
- But they love each other.
- Oh?
Sure.
Anybody can see.
Carol's a very unusual girl.
Don't you think so?
Oh, I'm so proud of her.
She's a very fine artist.
Oh, I'm... I'm sure we're both very fond of your daughter.
But, er, when it comes to considering marriage...
It's absolutely out of the question.
But why?
I don't understand!
I think you do.
I see.
You're ashamed, aren't you?
- Because I was in the sanatorium.
- Sanatorium?
Is that where you were?
No reason for us to go into that now, is there?
- Suppose I fix us all a little drink?
- Wait a minute.
I want to hear the truth.
Why were you in a sanatorium?
- Well... well, I was... it... it was...
- Answer me! Why?
- I... I was ill.
- Alice, don't you see you're upsetting her?
It wasn't just a sanatorium, was it?
- Was it!
- No!
No, it wasn't!
It was an asylum!
And it was hell!
Twenty years of pure hell!
But I'm not ashamed.
I paid for anything I did.
You'll never know how much I paid.
I'm all right now.
I'm all right.
You see, it... it's all over with.
That's... that's why they let me go.
- I'm all right.
- Let me go.
- L... I'm all right, I tell you. You must listen.
- Let me go.
- Carol and Michael can be married. I'm all right!
- You're insane!
Stop it,
Both of you!
My girl is going to have what she wants out of life.
She is.
I was cheated.
But she's not going to be.
Not my girl, not Carol!
Carol and Michael are going to be married!
And nobody's going to stop it!
- You'll see!
Now, now, now, now.
Let me go call Bill.
Perhaps he ought to drive you home.
Let me alone!
I don't need Bill.
I don't anybody!
Perhaps I'd better go after her.
Anything wrong?
We thought we heard some shouting.
- Where... where's Lucy?
- She left.
I'm afraid she was upset.
She ran out before we could stop her.
Mother?
Mother!
Where did she go?
Michael, we've got to find her.
Don't worry. We'll find her.
She can't have gotten far.
- I'll take my car.
- Right, I'll get mine.
No. Now, there's no sense in both of us going.
I think you ought to take the girls.
- No!
- He's right, Carol.
You wait here
I'll bring the car around.
Don't you worry.
I'll find her.
But I want you two at home when I bring her back.
Be careful, now, Bill.
- You sure you'll be all right?
- Of course.
I'm sorry
I made such a fuss.
I'll head back and contact Bill.
He's probably already found her.
- Thank you, Michael.
- Don't you worry.
We'll bring her home safe and sound.
Good night.
Why haven't we heard anything?
- Where could she be?
- Now, just calm down.
I'm sure everything's going to be all right.
- I should be out looking for her myself.
- Carol!
You'll do no such thing.
Now, you just listen to me.
You're going to get undressed and go to bed.
- B... but I've got to see her.
- I don't think anyone should see her tonight.
She'll be upset too. Let Bill bring her home and put her to bed.
We can talk things over sensibly in the morning.
Now, I want you to get into your pyjamas and go straight to bed.
Promise?
- If you need me just call. I'll be right here.
- All right.
Good night, dear.
Oh, Raymond, how can you at a time like this?
What's wrong with the time?
I always eat before I go to bed.
The way I feel now.
I couldn't sleep a wink.
Well, stop pacing.
You're wearing out the carpet.
Oh, really.
Raymond.
- Yes, darling, I'm listening.
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?
- There was a noise.
Oh, you're imagining things.
There it is again!
Raymond, there's someone outside that front door.
- Why don't you open it and let them in?
- Oh, Raymond.
All right, dear.
I'll go.
Be careful.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Nothing but your imagination.
Well, maybe it's someone at the back door.
Michael might have left it open when he took them out to see the dairy.
- Where are you going?
- It's bedtime.
- Well, please don't leave me.
- Then, come along.
- Not until Michael comes home.
- Oh, he's a big boy now.
I don't care.
I won't rest until he's home.
I want to know what happened.
Raymond, aren't you even interested?
All right. I'll wait with you.
Just let me get into my pyjamas first, hmm?
- Promise me you'll come right down.
- Only take me a minute.
SIGHING
SIGHING
Raymond?
Raymond?
Raymond, what are you doing in the study?
Raymond?
Operator,
I want the police!
This is an emergency!
Mrs Harbin.
Where have you been?
We've been looking everywhere for you.
Thank God you're here, Michael.
You've got to stop her.
She tried to kill me!
She tried to kill us all!
You've got to stop her!
It doesn't matter, darling.
Don't you understand?
We can be married!
They can't stop us now!
We'll have the money!
We'll have everything!
I planned this from the beginning,
- when I knew she was coming back.
- You planned?
Of course, I knew your parents would object to the marriage.
But we're rid of them now.
Everyone will think that
Lucy is the murderess.
Don't you see?
She's insane!
She's insane!
She's insane! She's insane!
She's insane!
I hate her! Insane!
I hate her!
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Please, no,
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Please, I love you.
I hate you!
I love you. I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I hate you!
Goddamn it, I hate you!
I hate you! Insane!
Insane!
All I did was insane!
You see, this was all part of Carol's plan: the heads on my pillow, the axe.
She probably made these heads right here in her studio.
Well, she must have put these in your room.
When you ran out, she removed them.
She also slashed all the heads off the photographs in the album, and made sure that
Michael saw them.
I remember staring through the window.
I couldn't understand why
Michael was so upset.
Well, she... she had to convince everyone that you were still... unbalanced.
She almost convinced me, too.
Bill, she must have started the day I came back.
Even when she took me to the beauty shop, it was all part of the plan.
Lucy Harbin took an axe,
and gave her husband 40 whacks.
When she saw...
I thought I was hearing voices.
She had to have hidden this in her purse.
Boy, she had everything worked out, didn't she?
Modelling your head, so she could make a mask from it that looked like you.
Even dressing like you.
Carol's whole plan depended on keeping me here, until she could kill the Fields, so I could take the blame.
Then when the doctor came to take me back, she killed him to prevent it.
When Krause began to suspect, she murdered him too.
Well, when did you realise what Carol was doing?
I didn't. I just went back to the Fields' to apologise.
Oh, Bill, how she must've hated me all those years.
Oh, those figurines, you're sending them to Carol?
No...
I'm putting them away forever.
- I'm going to Carol.
- You... you're going to Carol?
- Lucy, Carol is in a place like you were.
- I know.
Carol needs me.
She's needed me for a long time, but I was never there to help her.
Maybe now, I can help her.
SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
Hey, Joe, drag your foot, boy.
Look what we got here.
Hey, you wanna drag, huh?
Sure.
Come on, man. Get ready.
I'll show 'em how to drive. Just watch me.
Sir, as high as this river is right now, and with all the mud and sand it's carryin', they may never find that car.
Uh-uh.
Right there.
All right, let's hear your story about how it happened.
- It wasn't our fault, sir.
- Yeah?
We were the first ones on the bridge, and coming a-along following the tracks, and they wanted to get around us,
I guess, and they lost control...
You sure you didn't crowd 'em off?
Three hours.
Yeah? Not sure I wanna find that car now.
With this sand and with that current, we may never find 'em.
About all I guess we can do is keep tryin'.
Look.
Come on. Let's get down there.
Why, it's Mary Henry.
Are you all right?
How'd you get out?
Here, put this on.
We'd better get you back to town.
What about the other girls?
I don't remember.
Is this like the one
I'll be playing in Utah?
It's quite similar.
I supervised the installation myself.
The accident won't delay your going, will it?
No. I'm leaving this morning.
- There's nothing I can do here.
- That's right.
Well, Mary, you'll make a fine organist for that church.
Be very satisfying to you, I think.
It's just a job to me.
Well, that's not quite the attitude for going into church work.
I'm not taking the vows.
I'm only going to play the organ.
Oh, you want more than that.
Of course it doesn't pay much, but, well, at least it's a start.
Are you driving by Benton to see your folks?
No, I can't. I... I must hurry.
I... I've got to leave.
I'm going to drive straight through.
Mary, it takes more than intellect to be a musician.
Put your soul into it a little, okay?
Good luck, Mary.
Stop by and see us the next time you're in.
Thank you, but I'm never coming back.
Can I help you?
- Fill it up.
- All right.
Be anything else, lady?
Could you tell me what that big structure is back a few miles by the lake?
Oh, you mean the old bathhouse.
Yeah, that used to be a pretty ritzy place in the old days.
Then the lake went down and they made a dance hall out of it.
Then they put those buildings up out there and made some sort of a carnival there for a while.
Ah, that's years ago though.
Just stands out there now.
I see.
Uh, I have an address here of a rooming house. Could you direct me?
Oh, sure. Why, that's just right over here a little way.
Been savin' it for you since I got your letter.
Could've rented it yesterday if I'd wanted.
Oh, it... it's fine.
I-It's just about what I expected.
I knew you'd like it.
This ain't no regular roomin' house, you know.
I only got you and Mr. Linden across the hall.
Each room's got its own private bathroom too.
You can take all the baths you want.
I'm not one to fuss about things like that.
Thank you.
I think I'll be quite comfortable.
Well, hope you'll stay a while.
I'm downstairs in the back part of the house, so if there's anything else you need, guess it'll have to wait till morning.
Night.
Good night, Mrs. Thomas.
And this, Miss Henry, is our pride and joy.
This was made in the same town where I've been studying.
Of course.
That's where we heard about you.
You have found a place to stay?
- Yes, I have a room.
- Good.
Well, we hope you're going to like it here.
We're not the largest church in this area, of course, but we have a nice congregation.
We'll have to have some sort of reception.
They'll want to meet you.
- Couldn't we just skip that?
- Skip that?
I don't suppose it's an absolute necessity.
I don't know what some of the ladies will say.
If they say I'm a fine organist, that should be enough, shouldn't it?
Well, yes, of course.
We'll let it go at that for the time being.
But, my dear, you cannot live in isolation from the human race, you know.
- Mind if I try this now?
- I want you to.
You go right ahead.
I'll be next door at the manse, if you need me.
We have an organist capable of stirring the soul.
What do you see?
Oh. Nothing. Nothing at all.
I've practiced all afternoon and it's gotten me in a mood.
You need some fresh air.
I've got to make a call out past the lake.
Would you like to come along for the ride?
- You know that old pavilion out there?
- Mm-hmm.
- Will we pass it?
- Go right by it.
- Stop and look at it if you like.
- I would, with you along.
Good.
This used to be quite a place.
- It's been deserted for a long time now.
- Will you take me in?
Goodness no.
It isn't safe out there anymore.
That's why they put up this barrier.
Be very easy to step around it.
What attraction could there be for you out there?
I'm not sure.
I'm a reasonable person. I don't know.
Maybe I want to satisfy myself that the place is nothing more than it appears to be.
- Would you take me out there?
- No.
The law has placed it off-limits.
Wouldn't be very seemly for a minister to break the law, would it?
No. Maybe I can come back some other time.
Shall we go along now?
Ah, I thought that'd be you.
Good evening.
That organ playin' must take a long time.
You've been gone most the whole day.
I went for a long drive in the country with my new boss, an elderly minister.
Oh, ho.
That must have been a kick in the head.
I learned that from my other boarder, Mr. Linden.
Did you get your supper?
Oh, I forgot.
Well, this ain't no boardinghouse, but I got some coffee and sandwich makings left.
I could bring you some up after a while.
Good. I'll be taking one of those baths you're so generous with.
Take as many as you want.
I ain't one to make a fuss about a thing like that.
Come in, Mrs. Thomas.
Oh, uh, just a minute.
I thought you were Mrs. Thomas!
Yeah, I, uh...
I wondered when you asked me in.
I'm John Linden.
I'm your neighbor across the hall.
- Nice to meet you. Would you excuse...
- Hey, I, uh...
- I was just wondering...
- Just stand right there.
I forgot to introduce myself.
I'm Mary Henry.
Yeah, I know.
I, uh... I heard you tell Mrs. Thomas you haven't ate anything yet, huh?
I just thought, bein' neighborly and all...
I haven't eaten anything either.
I just thought I'd ask you out to dinner.
That's very thoughtful, but I can't accept.
I know we haven't met or anything yet, but I just thought...
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse me.
Look, there's a real nice restaurant right down the street, and I thought...
I'm the kind of guy who doesn't like to eat by himself.
I've made arrangements to eat in my room tonight.
Hey, if, uh, you change your mind, just holler.
Looks kind of lonesome in here.
Good night, Mr. Linden.
Miss Henry?
It's Mrs. Thomas.
Hmm.
Who's the man in the hall?
The...
Oh, you must mean Mr. Linden.
He has the room across the hall.
No. I mean the other one.
There is no other.
Me and you and Mr. Linden.
Us three is all there is in this house.
B-But you must have passed him out there.
You're needin' this food.
Goin' without eatin' makes you jumpy sometimes.
Maybe you heard the boards pop or somethin'.
These old houses creak worse than my knees.
I didn't hear him, Mrs. Thomas. I saw him.
Now, don't talk that way.
I don't sleep so good as it is.
It's these old houses. They...
They're big enough so that you could hide a man in every corner.
You just gotta not let your imagination run away with you.
- Are you going out there?
- Well, of course.
There's nobody there.
Now you just go and eat that sandwich I made for you.
Don't drink the coffee if coffee keeps you awake.
It won't.
Coffee never keeps me awake.
Well, good morning.
I heard your alarm. I knew you'd be up.
- Guess what I got.
- I can't imagine.
Oh, just what it takes to start the day off right.
I make it in my room.
It saves me havin' to get dressed up.
I guess I had to get dressed to come over here anyway.
Oh! It looks just like what I need.
Well, then two cups of coffee comin' up.
Say, uh,
I guess you took it wrong last night about me comin' to your door and all.
I'm not a very sociable person ordinarily.
How can I resist an inducement like this?
A what?
Come on. I don't know all those big words.
I'm just an ordinary guy who works in a warehouse, that's all.
I make pretty good money though. Hey.
I got a couple of shots left over from last night. Want a little bit in yours?
No, thanks. It's not the recommended breakfast for a church organist.
Oh, is that what you do?
You mean they pay somebody to play the organ in church?
Some churches do.
Hey, I hope you don't mind about this.
I just didn't know you were a church woman.
To me a church is just a place of business.
- Well, that's a funny way to look at it.
- Why?
People seem shocked because
I took a job in a church, and I regard it simply as a job.
I'm a professional organist and I play for pay, that's all.
Thinkin' like that, don't that give you nightmares?
Strange you should say that.
As a matter of fact... not for that reason, mind you... but I had the strangest feeling last night.
Yeah, I had kind of a lost night myself.
That's funny.
The world is so different in the daylight.
But in the dark, your fantasies get so out of hand.
But in the daylight, everything falls back into place again.
Let's have no more nights.
Or let's make them more interesting, huh?
Say, how'd you get to be a church organist?
I studied it in college.
I could've gone to college.
I used to play pretty good football, but they wanted me to take a lot of classes and things.
- They're that way.
- I'm just as smart as the next guy.
But I just didn't dig what they were teachin' in school.
And the thing I hated most was "principal products."
Principal products?
You know, like, uh,
"The principal products of Brazil are..."
Oh, geez.
Coffee beans, snake oil.
You know, like that.
When I was in school,
I couldn't care less.
The only thing I cared about was girls.
Didn't they offer a course in that?
If they would've done that,
I would've graduated.
What's the matter?
Can you still taste the coffee?
Come on.
What do you think, I'm an alcoholic?
I just like to start the day off in a good mood, that's all.
You must be hilarious by noon.
I'm just the kind of a guy employers want.
You know, the happy worker.
Come on.
Didn't I make your morning happier?
This morning you're exactly what I needed.
You're gonna need me in the evenin' too.
You just don't know it yet.
I'll rinse off these cups.
Ah, no, no.
Just spoils the flavor for tomorrow.
Well, thank you for the coffee.
It was unsanitary, but delicious.
Well, uh, should've put some of the germ killer inside.
Well, I hate to leave so early.
Think you can get through the door?
You got the wrong impression of me.
Well, I meant because you have so many things to carry.
Oh. Like I said, I hate to leave.
It's been a pleasure, Mr. Linden, but I'm sure you have to get to work.
- Don't you?
- Nope.
I have the whole day free for shopping.
Does the hem hang right in back?
We might change the hemline a little.
The drape is just fine.
Otherwise it looks very nice.
I'm sure it isn't very chic to take the second dress, but I like it.
We alter it a little here to make it straight all the way around.
Do you want to go back to your dressing room?
I like it fine. I believe I'll have you deliver the dress, if you don't mind.
I did say I'd take it.
What's the matter with her?
What's the matter with everyone?
Why don't they answer me?
- What is it?
- That man!
I didn't mean any harm.
I just stopped to get a drink.
No. No.
It was that man.
That man!
There was someone else there!
That strange man was there!
Now, look. You've had a fright.
Hysteria won't solve anything.
Now control yourself.
Look, I'm Dr. Samuels.
My office is right across the street there.
You've had a shock.
If you would like my assistance,
I'll be glad to offer it.
Thank you.
- Could I come with you now?
- Certainly.
I'll take her over to my office.
We'll see that she's all right.
My purse.
It was more than just not being able to hear anything, or make contact with anyone.
It was as though... as though for a time I didn't exist.
As though I had no place in the world, no part of the life around me.
And then you saw this... this man?
Yes.
You'll excuse my back, but I wanted to get some of that written down.
I must have been talking for an hour.
Anything else?
Anything you haven't told me?
That's all there is.
That's the whole story.
He's been following me.
That's all there is to it.
It isn't that simple though, is it?
What do you mean?
He couldn't have been in the park this afternoon, or one of us men would've seen him.
And that night in the hallway, you said yourself the landlady came up a minute later, and she didn't see him?
What are you driving at?
It's been less than a week since you were in a car that crashed into the river.
How you got out of that no one seems to know.
But that experience must have been a serious emotional shock.
You think I imagined all of it, don't you?
You think I'm insane?
I didn't say that. I don't mean that.
I'm a competent person.
If anything, I'm a realist.
I'm not given to imagining anything.
Hogwash.
All of us imagine things.
Have you ever heard two men talking behind your back and imagined they were talking about you?
Have you never imagined you saw someone you knew, and walked up to them and found they were a perfect stranger?
- I don't see what this has to do with it.
- The point is this.
Our imaginations play tricks on us.
They often misinterpret what we see and hear. Do you agree?
I suppose so.
If that can happen in ordinary times, go a step further.
Look what can happen in a high fever, or following a serious emotional shock.
It doesn't seem possible that I could have imagined all of it.
Does this man, this figure, resemble anyone you've ever known?
- An acquaintance, or your father?
- No.
- Have a boyfriend here or back home?
- No, no desire for one.
- Never?
- No.
I'm surprised to find myself saying that, but it's true.
I have no desire for the close company of other people.
Have you always felt this way?
I... I don't know.
Don't you want to join in the things that other people do, share the experiences of other people?
I don't seem capable of being very close to people.
I do feel that perhaps I'm trying to reach out for those other things.
Do you feel guilty wanting them?
I don't understand you.
I'm not a psychiatrist, and perhaps
I'm being clumsy at all this, but I am suggesting that perhaps this figure represents a guilt feeling.
Oh, that's ridiculous!
Maybe. Frankly, I don't know.
Well, I know one thing.
If my imagination is playing tricks on me,
I'm going to put a stop to it.
You're a very strong-willed person, aren't you?
I survive, if that's what you mean.
That old pavilion out by the lake.
Somehow you associate it with all this, don't you?
I could go out there.
I could put an end to that too.
- I could go out there...
- Now don't be hasty.
If it is all in my imagination,
I could put a stop to it.
Maybe. But at least someone should be with you. I can't possibly...
As you say, Doctor,
I'm a person of strong will.
And the time to go out there is now.
And if I have to, I can go alone.
Say, uh,
I don't wanna get turned down again.
I was thinkin' of askin' you out to dinner.
I stopped for a bite to eat on the way.
Anyway, I have to practice at the church this evening.
Look, uh, how's about if
I pick you up afterward?
We'll go someplace and dance or somethin'.
I'm sorry. I'm not much for dancing.
Uh, hey, uh, you mind if I ask you a question?
I won't know until I hear it.
What, are you afraid of men?
No, I'm not afraid of men.
Well, you seem sort of cold.
This morning when I brought you the coffee, you were friendly.
This morning I needed company.
Well, maybe you'll need company tonight.
It's better than walkin' home alone.
Yes, it is.
I should be finished around 9:00.
- Will that be all right?
- That's okay by me.
Say, uh, I'll see you in church, huh?
Profane! Sacrilege!
What are you playing in this church?
Have you no respect?
Do you feel no reverence?
Then I feel sorry for you and your lack of soul.
This organ, the music of this church, these things have meaning and significance to us.
I assumed they did to you.
But without this awareness,
I'm afraid you cannot be our organist.
In conscience, I must ask you to resign.
That does not mean that I am abandoning you, nor should you turn your back on the church.
There is help here, and I urge you to accept it.
Well, hi there. I've been waitin' an awful long time for you.
My car's over there.
I know the right place to go.
What's the matter? Don't you drink either?
- Not really.
- Not really.
How else is there if you don't drink really? Answer me that, hmm?
Now me, I not only drink really,
I really drink.
What's the matter?
Don't you like the music either?
- I like it fine.
- You don't like it.
You don't like to dance, and you don't like to drink.
You don't like for a man to hold you close. That's it, isn't it?
- I didn't say that.
- You haven't said anything all evening.
Why don't I go play that song again, you like it so much.
Hey, Johnny, who's the doll?
Nobody you know, Chip.
Oh, come on now.
You been holdin' out on me.
That's not the kind of pig you usually drag around.
You quit lickin' your chops.
She's outta your class.
You wanna bet?
Lay off, huh?
- I got somethin' on the stove there, man.
- I'll help you put it over.
I don't want her to think
I even know creeps like you.
Good luck.
Meet someone you know?
Yeah.
He's a... college fella.
He told me about this girl that's been wantin' to meet me.
- Wanted me to meet her.
- What'd you tell him?
I said, how could I?
You're my date, you know.
Said you, uh, didn't seem to enjoy my company much.
Oh, that's not true.
I really appreciate you taking me out this evening.
I'd had a miserable night if you hadn't.
Ah. Forget it. Come on, here.
Join the party. Drink up.
I paid good money for that stuff.
It ain't poison.
I'm sorry if I annoy you.
You know, I don't get you.
First you stand me off.
Well, that's okay. That's class.
Figure you got somethin', you're just holdin' back.
Now everything I say is okay.
You're a mouse.
Yesterday I didn't care.
Tonight I wanna be with you.
With me, or just with anybody?
With you.
Why don't you thaw out, hmm?
- You wanna be alone. I'll leave you alone.
- No, I don't. No, I...
I like being with you, really I do.
I don't want to be alone tonight.
I want to be near you.
- Do you mean that?
- Yes.
Why don't you and me get outta here, huh?
You know, my room's only a couple of feet from yours.
Ain't likely to get very far from me, are ya?
- Oh, geez.
- Shh!
- You'll wake Mrs. Thomas.
- Ah, that old girl lives in the back.
She won't hear nothin'.
Honey...
You don't wanna go in there all by yourself, do you?
It's dark, and it's lonely in there.
You don't have to be alone tonight.
Just let me come in a while.
Let me stay with you, huh?
Look, you don't wanna be alone, do ya?
No.
- I'm sorry, I...
- Look, look, honey.
Honey, you asked me in.
You must like me a little, huh?
Hey, what's the matter with you?
What's goin' on around here?
What's the matter with you?
That man's after me.
You gotta stop him! He's after me again.
- I'm gettin' outta here.
- You don't have to go!
Not me, sister. That's just what I need, gettin' mixed up with some girl that's off her rocker!
I don't wanna be left alone!
What'd you find out, Doctor?
Not very much, I'm afraid.
I am sure glad you just happened around.
I was gonna call somebody, but I was afraid I'd have to pay the bill.
I came on purpose.
I've been thinking about her ever since she left my office yesterday.
What's she been up to?
Only the devil knows that.
I heard her movin' things all around that room all night.
Never heard such goings-on.
And she wouldn't let me in her room this morning.
- She's a strange one.
- Mmm.
She absolutely refuses my help.
I can't say that I blame her.
There's something about her that completely baffles me.
I've urged her to call upon me if she feels she needs help, and I hope she will.
I can't let her stay in this house.
You won't have to worry about that.
She's determined to leave the city, and she wants to get away as soon as possible.
I hope she does leave.
I hope she can.
Decided to leave, did ya?
Where ya goin'?
I can't refund none of your week's rent when you go off like that.
Sounds like your transmission.
Can you pull it up on the rack?
Okay, fine.
- Will it take long?
- Well, I have to check it first.
Would you like to get out?
- May I just sit here?
- Sure. Suit yourself.
When is the next eastbound bus?
When does the next bus leave?
I must get on it!
I want to get out of here.
I want to get away from here.
Eastbound bus, now loading, gate nine.
Don't close it! Wait! Wait, wait!
Let me in. You've gotta let me in.
I gotta get on that train.
I gotta get away from here.
Please! Please!
You hear me. You can hear me.
Why can't I hear anything?
Will you help me? I need your help.
J-Just a moment, please.
Why can't anybody hear me?
I... I came to you, Doctor, because you're my... my last hope.
I-I-If you don't help me,
I... I have to go back there.
He's... He's trying to take me back somewhere.
Doctor, you've got to tell me what to do.
Her car's still over there, and then there are footprints leading up to here.
And then nothing.
Okay!
The Buick's right down there.
Bring it on up.
Mother Joan Of The Angels
Bells
Why are they ringing?
That's the custom here.
For lost travellers
Bishop's orders
For people lost in the forest
It is dangerous to be in the forest
- What's your name?
- Juray
Going back tomorrow?
Yes. The monks want me
- Are you far from here?
- A whole day's journey
What thin slices you are cutting, Father
That way, you won't even know you're eating bread
That's how we always cut bread at the monastery
Why?
Why?
It's greed and gluttony to devour large pieces
As I am a Wolodkowicz
You must be an extraordinary glutton, Father
May God repay you
How about telling the Father's fortune, Awdosia?
Why not? Priests too have fortunes
Many a maiden or woman...
...seeks her advice before entering a convent
He'd like to...
He'd like to see his future too but he can't
Tell him something about it
- What should I tell him?
- Everything
Whether his journey will be successful...
...and who he'll meet
He'll meet a maid who will be a mother
That's common enough in Poland
You poor, poor lamb
Poor, poor lamb
You'll love a crooked one
Blessed be the Lord
For ever and ever
The holy maids are waiting for you,
Father
And very impatient they are too
But no one knew I was coming
They know everything
But they tell lies sometimes
So you too have to come to see the holy maids, Father?
Do you know what's going on there?
What kind of holy maids they are?
Don't say such things
Leave it to the theologians.
You just pray and be silent
Sister Porteress even left the gate open last night...
...for the priest who is to save them
How do you know what's going on in the convent?
I do odd jobs there
Are men allowed in there?
What good is a woman at chopping up big logs?
Or slaughtering a bull or a ram?
Surely the sisters do not eat meat
They do.
They say the devil tempts them
Guard us from malice, oh Lord!
I do believe in our Holy Catholic Church...
...as I'm a Wolodkowicz
There's a village, Father...
...where everyone's a Wolodkowicz
The soil is poor there.
We grow just flax and oats
The apples are sour.
The flax is knotty, full of weeds
But the booze is as strong as anywhere
Your health...
...Canon
- I'm not a Canon
- Then you will be
- To your heath
- To your health
It's time
I must go
You go to sleep, Juray
Get up early
Father Provincial wants you back at once
Kaziuk
I must go to the convent
- Kaziuk will accompany you, Father
- May God repay you
Blessed be the Lord
For ever and ever
- He did have some vodka
- Not such a saint after all
They're all alike. All of them
Do your holy maids eat pork like us?
What for?
They have another kind of life
Don't talk so much.
You'll bring some mischief on us
In an evil hour
As I'm a Wolodkowicz, tell us what's going on in that convent?
Are the devils at large among the holy maids?
Stop that, sir
It's no joking matter
People are spying on each other
And reporting to the priests
Are there many priests in the convent?
Four. To do the exorcising.
This one's the fifth
In Father Garniec's case...
...there were 12 of them who sentenced him to the stake
They had no reason to burn Father Garniec
How about the holy maids?
Still dancing?
They're up to some better tricks
Is it true that Father Garniec was a sorcerer?
Are you really sorry for him?
Not sorry but it's a pity just the same
Even if he were the worst
What kind of man was he?
He was no saint
And he sizzled on the stake like a pig
How can they burn a man like that?
Go on, eat
How did they do it?
They just dragged him to the stake?
Did they take his clothes off?
The clothes catch fire first
So the man is left naked
Father Joseph
Welcome, Father Joseph
I'm Father Brym's housekeeper
Splendid, Krysia.
Now leave me alone with our guest
A priest is no guest
No. Go and play, children
Kaziuk
Poor lambs. They're my only comfort
- Orphans?
- Their mother is alive
Their father was burnt
They're Garniec's children
What future can they hope for?
The children of a priest and a sorcerer
Do you believe he had bad intentions?
I may doubt his sorcery but not his bad intentions
Did Satan get into him?
You'll have a hard task here, Father
I fasted and mortified myself the whole autumn
I prayed and keep praying.
Yet I'm afraid of him
- Of whom?
- The Evil One
I never set foot in the convent
I have my parish and church
Father Garniec also kept away but the women...
...I mean the nuns, were his undoing
True, he was young and handsome
While I'm old I won't come to
Mother Joan of the Angels in her dreams
Did Father Garniec come to her?
He apparently came right through the convent walls
That's just the women's tales
You think so?
I do, but that's between us
The nuns wanted Father Garniec to come to them
These maids or the demons in them...
...tell such things at the top of their voices, in public
Saying where the devils sit in them
In church too. During exorcising
Such a shame. In church?
Tell this to the exorcising priests
They say if the people see the devil...
...their faith in God and the Church grows
That's why they show such things to the people
Like tricks at a fair
Can you bring God to a man through the devil?
Who knows, Father
It may not be such a bad way
Maybe saints are made that way
Unless...
Unless there are no devils in there at all
Every woman is naturally inclined to fall
And to be a saint
It's enough to look at the world
I don't know the world
I couldn't say
My mother became a Carmelite.
My sisters were nuns
I grew up among women who were almost saints
It is well, dear Father, that you're pious...
...and that you don't know women
I fear you'll have some hard moments here
Pray for me, Father
What's worth the prayer of a sinner?
But pray I shall
Give me your blessing, Father
Come on, children. Let's go home
I'll see you to the convent, Father
Don't bother
It's more dignified for a priest that way
- I don't care
- But we do
I'll always accompany you, Father.
We're good people
- All of you?
- Perhaps not all
Who knows before evening what the day will bring?
Here we are
One of the sisters will open the gate
Sister Margaret
Mother Superior's been expecting you since yesterday
Welcome, Father. It's good to see you
We've been longing for your help
Our common prayers will help us
Won't you sit down, Father?
For months we've been beset by great miseries
The priests who are staying with us...
...have no power over them
Our only hope is in you, Father
I've been sent to take care only of you
The other priests will look after the sisters
If the spirits leave me, they will leave the sisters too
It all started with me
I'll try to free you from your demon
Eight of them!
Behemoth, Balaam, Isacaaron...
...Gresil, Aman, Asmodeus,
Leviathan and Dog's Tail
Do not listen to them, my daughter.
Evil has many shapes and faces
How long is it since you've been to confession?
Since we were first possessed, half a year ago
That's a long time.
Why did you put off penance?
We didn't
The demons keep us away from the holy sacraments
The demons keep you away?
Hasn't perhaps your spiritual laziness...
...taken the shape of those demons?
You don't believe I'm possessed,
Father?
I have to, my child, though unwillingly
Satan enters our souls in many ways
Oh, he's very powerful
We know little about the nature of demons
And what they make the possessed say is not to be trusted
You know they're the sons of falsehood
What is falsehood, Reverend Father?
And what is truth?
Every Christian's conscience...
...should tell him the difference between black and white
Was it evil that Father Garniec perished because of me?
Ask your conscience
If I told you what horrors this man did to me
What abominable things!
I will tell you. I must
You have to know my inner life...
...all my torments, past and present...
...if you're to save me from the pit of solitude where God has cast me
Calm yourself, my daughter
No one is alone on earth. No one
I saw him by my bedside
My Guardian Angel
He looked like Kaziuk from the inn
But he had such long hair, down to his shoulders
He bent over me and touched my breast
There were five drops of fragrant balm on my gown
Forgive me. I've no one to tell of my misery and horror
Defend me
Defend me, Reverend Father
All right
Go to your duties, my daughter.
I'll pray here
Then we'll think of our sins and failings
Don't think it will be so easy...
...to drive me out of this sweet body
- Mother Joan!
- I'm not Mother Joan
I'm no one
Don't think we're afraid of your Latin
You filthy priest!
What is happening to you?
May God be blessed, Sister Margaret
- For ever and ever
- I thought you weren't coming today
There's so much work with those exorcisms
The nuns pray while you do all the work
I'm out of breath
I like it here
It's nicer among people
I'm very happy to see a representative of the famous convent
You must have some exciting tales to tell
What can I tell?
You come from the great world
But for you and your convent...
...we wouldn't be here at all
The exorcisms brought us here
The demons leave me alone
I seem to have a hard soul and an undesirable body
The new priest will do some real exorcising
He's too weak for our convent
He was as pale as death after talking to Mother Superior
And she only did the trick with the sooty door handle
Does Mother Joan cheat?
No. It's the devil who tells her to blacken the handle every morning
- That's not cheating
- She mustn't cheat
She mustn't cheat. It has to be real!
We should have gone to the fair to see the tightrope walkers
I don't like these fiendish nuns
A pity the demons don't lift their skirts
Sometimes they take off their clothes
Before Father Garniec was burnt...
...they used to run naked in the garden and call him
Let's teach the nun to drink
Let's go
Sister, as I am a Wolodkowicz
Have a glass of mead, Sister
- Gracious, you're just like Tartars
- Take your chance, Sister
- No
- You have to sin at least once
- Drink, Sister, drink
- Dear God, what a brute
- Here's to the convent
- And to Mother Joan
Oh, my dear, dear mother
I would take the veil, please
Rather than a husband, who would be a brute, please
Rather than a lover with a stick to beat me
Rather than a thrashing
I would take the veil, please
I would rather sing with the nuns in the convent
Than take me a husband and much trouble with it
I would not mind singing Matins at cold daybreak
If this could but save me from a husband's beatings
Father Joseph is coming
What are you doing here, my daughter?
I only came to see this woman
Go and sin no more
The devil is there and here too
That's how it is in this world
What do you know of the world?
- Do you, Father?
- Not much either
I have spent all my life in a monastery
Watch your step, Kaziuk
To hell with this axe
I know how you abhor my coming to fight you
Here is your kingdom but I've been sent in the name of God
I belong to another kingdom, the Kingdom of Light
As you to the Kingdom of Darkness
I belong to Good and you to Evil
Kaziuk
- Do you believe in the devil?
- I do
- Have you seen him?
- I have
- With horns?
- Stupid
With wings
And with Mother Superior's face
- What did he look like?
- Don't be so curious
Tell me
I've never seen the devil
Nor have I
I didn't see him properly
But I saw him torment the sisters
Particularly our Superior
Mother Joan of the Angels
- Is that what she's called?
- Yes
Mother Joan of the Angels
She ought to be called
Mother of the Devils
It's awful to be alone in the world
What if the devil gets into me?
Devils don't care for the likes of us
You're only saying so
Sometimes I hate my dad so much
I could kill him
And if you kill your dad, the devil will never let you go
Why kill your dad?
He'll die some day anyway
If he dies, he dies
But before he dies he'll go on being bad
He beats Mother and me too
Pray for him
To hell with him
Say, "In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit
"God, guard my father"
That I can say. God guard my father
Now go to sleep
In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit
I am asleep
Good night
Satan!
I order thee to leave the body...
...of the most reverend
Mother Joan of the Angels
Leave her!
Leave her, Satan!
I won't! Whatever you do
I won't. I don't want to.
I don't want to
Balaam, Isacaaron, Asmodeus...
...Gresil, Aman, Leviathan
Speak, which of you is it?
It's Dog's Tail, at your service
Answer me, Dog's Tail
Wilt thou leave the body of this woman if I order thee?
I will at once but what about my brothers?
Balaam is in my head,
Gresil in my belly...
...and Asmodeus...
Satan, I order thee to leave her!
Dog's Tail has left me
I'm not Mother Joan
I'm Satan! My name is Gresil
Gresil. Satan
Thou didst not enter this woman against God's will
Thou owest obedience to those who speak in God's name
Wilt thou be obedient?
I will
Show us, Evil Spirit, how Seraphs worship the Lord of Hosts
How do Seraphs worship the Lord of Hosts?
Gresil...
Now show us how kings praise the Almighty
I order thee in the name of God...
...to pay homage to the sign of our salvation
Don't order him to do it, Father.
He'll torment me
Pay homage, I order thee!
No, I won't!
I won't pay homage
No earthly or heavenly power can force me to do that
Humble thyself!
No. No!
Accursed be God the Father and the Son and the Ghost...
...and the Blessed Virgin and all Heaven!
Oh, Holy Cross. Oh, Holy Virgin
Forgive me all my blasphemies
Oh, God!
Oh, Lord, defend me from Satan
- Sister
- You frightened me again
- No more exorcising in church?
- There will be more
But Mother Superior is to be kept in solitude
In solitude
Kneel down, Mother Joan
Kneel down, my daughter
Let us pray together
I'll say the prayers...
...and you try to communicate with me in the spirit
May peace come upon you
Love drives Evil away
Fill yourself with love
Is it possible not to give love for love?
Our Father who art in Heaven
Hosanna
We cleaned up the place nicely...
...but the pigeons are a nuisance
Tell Odrym to patch up the holes in the roof
Yes, Mother Joan
There are so many of those sweet birds
No one will disturb you here
Thank you, Sister
In solitude you may get rid of your pride
Your greatest sin
Mother Joan, when you're among people...
...you only think of your superiority
Who am I but a poor servant of the Lord...
...who worships Him in a remote convent?
I'm only a nun
What if my father is a prince of an impoverished branch?
He sits in his Smolensk marshes.
No one knows him
Is it my fault that I'm possessed by eight powerful demons?
Be good like a child.
Be happy like a child
God loves us very much
What if Satan leaves me and takes possession of you?
God have mercy upon my sinful soul
There's no truth on earth
You utter words of despair again
After so many days of prayer, so many nights of humility
Don't!
The devils are rising up in me again
You yourself are becoming a devil
Let go. Let go!
Father
- God be with you
- Father Joseph is out
I've come to see you
You have no idea what's going on in the convent
No one is to move a step outside the gate
They're making bars for Father Joseph
Mother Joan's been worse than ever
It looks as bad as with Father Garniec
Shut up!
It may be an evil hour
The squire too keeps coming back to our muddy village
They say he's borrowing money from local Jews
Stupid
Squires don't do such things
You know nothing about it
Don't I? When it started with Father Garniec...
You must be surprised to see me back
But something drives me here
Are you so curious about the convent?
It's here, Father
What's the good of my coming here?
Who knows? He's a wise man
He always says,
"Don't ask for trouble
"It comes uninvited"
Please, come in
The rabbi is expecting you
You must be surprised
Not at all. I've been expecting to see one of you here
- You know?
- I do
What are they?
A priest asking a poor rabbi...
...what demons are?
Don't you know?
Maybe the trouble is not demons but the absence of angels
Mother Joan's angel has gone and now she's alone with herself
Maybe it's only human nature
Stop this mockery, Jew
You sit over your books by candlelight...
...and you don't care that people suffer
That women...
Do women suffer?
Let them. That's their fate
No one can escape his fate
What do you know of demons?
Sit down, priest
Say, what's an evil spirit, where does he abide?
What is he, where does he come from?
Who made him? Adonai?
God. Who else could have made him?
What if Satan created the world?
Enough!
For if the Lord created it...
...why is there so much evil in it?
Death and sickness and wars
Why are we Jews being persecuted?
Why are our sons being slaughtered?
Our daughters raped?
- Original sin
- Original sin
The fall of the first parents?
How many times did man fall and rise?
How many times has patient Abel been killed by Cain?
All the evil man commits...
...is no measure of the evil that torments him
The fall of the first man, the fall of the first angel
Why did angels come down from heaven...
...to beget giants on earthly women?
Tell me why, Father?
Angels...
...are mysterious beings
Your Mother Joan calls herself 'of the Angels'
But what does she know of angels?
What are angels, Priest?
God sends them
And who sends the devil?
Unless God wills it,
Satan cannot possess a man's soul
When can he possess it?
When man loves him very much
Can man love Satan?
Love is at the root of everything on Earth
We had a young squire here who loved a Jewish girl so much...
...that when he died he took possession of her soul
She was brought here and stood where you stand
And I called on this spirit to leave her
Did he?
He would not be driven out
You see!
He said to me he would not leave her
He took her soul
And she died
Love is as strong as death
I shall learn nothing from you
You'd like to learn everything at once
What my great grandfather taught...
...and his great grandfather
All that was written in the scrolls, in the Zohar and the Temureh
You want me to give it to you in three words
Just like some business receipt
One, two, three, then done?
You want to hear about all demons created by eternal Adonai?
And those born of countless angels and earthly women?
Those that have risen in you...
...to obscure your reason...
...and to take away your wisdom
And those that are now in your heart
You want to know all about demons?
Let them enter your soul
My demons are my business and my soul is my own
You are me and I am you
Oh, God. What are you saying?
You know nothing, Priest.
You walk in darkness
Your ignorance is like the black cloak of night
I can teach you nothing.
My teachings are not your teachings
You are me
Be gone!
Be gone
I too know nothing. Nothing at all
Sister, tell Mother Superior to come to the attic
- To the attic?
- Tell her there will be no exorcisms
Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth...
...and called thee from the chief men thereof
I have chosen thee and not cast thee away
Fear thou not for I am with thee
- Why have you called me?
- I desire your salvation
Where is salvation?
It's so difficult for me to speak my heart
Speak, I'll take it upon myself
I shall absorb your sins
The most terrible thing is that I like Satan
It gives me joy being possessed
I'm proud this fate has befallen me
That the demons torment me more than the others
You commit the sin of pride again.
Pray for your humility
- I am lost
- I too thought I was lost
But now I don't believe it.
I am strong, powerful
Mother Joan, I shall lead you
Where to?
What way are you showing me?
You only want me to be calm, colourless, small
To be just like any ordinary nun
All right. Listen
I myself open my soul to the demons
But you want me to be like the thousands...
...who have no aim on earth
You want to see me at prayer all day long
To see me eating beans every day
Do you promise me salvation for this?
I do not want such salvation
If one can't be a saint, it's better to be damned
Oh, if only you could make me a saint.
I want nothing else
Do you know what it means to understand everything?
It means to be one with light eternal and yet remain on Earth
To stand on altars with candles and incense
To return in prayer to all lips
Oh, that is life
That is life eternal
If not...
If not...
I'd rather be with the devils
Joan, calm yourself
Calm yourself
All redemption is in love
Love is as strong as death
Make a saint of me
That I cannot do
- Don't crush the grain
- I'm scaring off the wolves
Wolves, right
Why is the child crying?
She's wet herself, Father
Take her to the kitchen or she'll catch a cold
And you wanted to scare off the wolves
Good
Well, yes
I think I'm being tempted to this sweet beer...
...by some lesser demon
For if evil exists, it can be great and small
The great devil is called Behemoth
And the small one, Beer, perhaps
Yes
Go home, Father Joseph. Go at once
The journey will calm you
You'll go back to your cell, see your books...
...and the demons may leave your body and soul
No, no!
I don't want them to.
Let him stay in me
He is me and I am him
The devil who possessed her soul and body
Bells
For those who are lost
You can hear them far away
I like these bells
They ring every day
It's terrible in the forest, isn't it?
The wolves howl
The Evil One is at work
So?
She has changed already
Remember, we leave before dawn
Hold it
Hold it
Stop
Oh, my dear, dear mother
I would take the veil, please
Rather than a husband who would be a brute, please
Rather than a lover with a stick to beat me
Rather than a thrashing
I would take the veil, please
I would rather sing much with the nuns in the convent
Than take me a husband and much trouble with it
Why have you stopped singing?
Go on dancing and enjoying yourselves. God will forgive you
For you know not what you do
Man is a queer fish
What will become of your Mother Joan?
She'll stay a nun
And the devil?
The devil will always find work
The devils left Mother Joan and possessed Father Joseph
Sister Margaret too it seems
Has the squire come for her?
He's possessed too. She's so ugly
I like her
She's big
What about your dad?
Drinking and beating
- Do you pray for him?
- No
Pray with me
Say, God guard my father
I don't mind if I do
- God, guard my father
- And everybody
And everybody
Now go to sleep
Good night
Good night
You've come so soon
So soon
Go away!
Don't torment me
Stay!
I know that if you leave me you'll go back to Mother Joan
Don't go!
Let her be free. Let her be a saint
Take me
And don't ever go back to Mother Joan
Don't ever leave me!
What must I do?
No! Don't order me to do that
Stay!
Yes, I remember where the axe is
I remember
The stable smells of blood, Squire
Don't talk nonsense
- The horses sense something
- Mount!
- And the lady?
- Come on!
The squire's gone
The squire has deserted me
It's all your fault.
You talked me into sin
Sister Margaret!
The squire has deserted me
You, son of the devil, to hell with you
Kaziuk!
The grooms have been killed
Kaziuk and the others have been murdered
Killed
I'll call the priest. Father Joseph
Father Joseph!
They were innocent
They went to heaven
Father Joseph
Oh, God.
Now I'm in Satan's power for ever
Father Joseph, the squire has deserted me
- Go back
- No
I won't go back to the convent
I can't
I do not want to
Go and tell Joan I did it for her
For her good. To save her
To keep the devils in me.
They wanted to go back to her
Tell her. Don't forget
Tell her
I did it out of love
We're on our way to Nashville,
Been traveling quite a spell.
The road's been mighty bumpy!
Yeah, and I don't feel too well!
We've got to get to Nashville!
Yes, it's really quite a spot!
You're going to like old Nashville.
I still don't feel so hot!
It's Jamboree time!
Jamboree time!
I can hardly wait to meet up with the crowd!
It's Jamboree time!
Jamboree time!
Come on, let me hear it, clear and loud!
We're on our way!
We're on our way!
We're on our way to a swinging Jamboree!
Yeah! We're on our way.
We're on our way!
We're on our way to
Nashville, Tennessee, 000eeee!
Drop it!
It's okay. Sorry you got caught in the middle!
What's goin' on?
- Spies!
- Spies!
That's right! Over in
Acme City, and these hills.
- They're all over the place!
- Let's get out of here!
Jeepers, you have to relax!
You're headed for a nervous breakdown
If you don't unwind a little bit!
Well, don't worry ma'am, they won't bother you,
Uh, unless you're carrying some secrets in this guitar!
- You entertainers?
- Yes, sir.
We're on our way to Nashville.
We're doin' a Jamboree there!
- Well, good luck!
- Thank you.
The road's clear.
You can pass on.
Thank you.
Woody, we have to do something about Jeepers!
Yeah, I know!
He's been working night and day,
And I think his nerves are on edge!
- Jeeps.
- What?
Now Jeepers,
You know we appreciate what you've done for us.
We sure do, Jeep!
And, I realize you've worked awfully hard
To try to get the show lined up
So we could appear back in Nashville.
That's right!
And, the show isn't
- until tomorrow night.
- That's right.
And, Woody and I are going to find a nice,
Quiet, restful place for you.
We'll see that you relax.
Yeah, relax. That's what
Jeepers needs, relax.
Howdy!
Hi! Thought this place was closed!
Well, it should be!
- Nobody ever comes this way!
- Where are we?
- Sleepy Junction.
- Sleepy Junction.
- Where are we?
- Sleepy Junction.
Oh!
Hey Woody! We're in
Sleepy Junction!
Sir, we're looking for a nice, quiet place to spend the night.
- Uh, a motel.
- No.
- A hotel.
- No.
A boarding house?
Ma'am, there just ain't nothin' around here!
What happened to this place?
Everybody moved out!
Moved over to Acme City!
They got a big missile plant there,
And the people go where the work is.
Jeeps, I'm sorry buddy.
But, we'll find a place for you, so you can rest and relax.
Aw, that's okay.
I feel good now.
I'm not nervous or anything.
- Thunder?
- Thunder!
Yeah, it looks like a storm's coming up!
It don't look too good, does it?
Hey! I just thought of something!
There's the old
Beauregard mansion!
Oh, it's quiet alright!
At least you'd get in out of the rain, and have a place to stay!
- Well, where is it?
- Just follow this road.
Thank you.
Hey! Wait!
I forgot to tell
'em it's haunted!
Hurry up! That rain's going to be coming down any minute!
Wait! Listen! Listen!
Jeepers! Come on!
- You're not afraid, are you?
- Oh no!
Well, come on!
What are you two waiting for?
I'm waiting for my courage to come back!
Come on, let's go!
I think my courage just left again!
Oh Jeepers! It's just a shutter that fell!
Listen, I don't like this place one little bit!
Heehaha! Heeha!
I said, put that monkey back in the cage!
- Alright, alright!
- I want him to stay in the cage!
If he comes out once more, once more, I'll kill him!
Oh Anatole, you get in there, be a good boy.
Be a good boy. Ahnananana!
- Be quiet!
- (GORILLA) Ohohoh! Ohohoh!
You shouldn't talk to Anatole like that! He's sensitive!
(GORILLA) Euch!
Euch! Euch! Euch!
Stay away from that monkey!
Well, it's not exactly a Hilton hotel!
Oh!
Jeeps, go get the television set!
- Let's start a fire!
- Okay!
Hey, I'd put the top up on the car, but I know it don't work!
Hey! This is kind of fun, you know? Sorta like camping out!
I'd like to explore this place once we get settled down!
Woody?
There's something out there!
- What?
- Calm down, boy.
Listen, I saw uh, uh, a thing out there!
Jeepers, you're a nervous wreck!
Now you're seeing things!
- I am?
- Boy, you in bad shape!
What you need is to relax!
Now, I want you to know
Jeeps, no matter what happens,
That you've been one of the best
Little business managers anybody could have.
But, you need to unwind!
Come over here and sit down in this comfortable chair,
And just relax man!
That's what I'll do. I gotta relax!
Sing him a song Woody, that always relaxes him!
Alright!
Jeeps, this is one I was telling you about I wrote the other day.
Called uh,
What was the name of that?
Oh, uh, 'Livin' in a Trance'.
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah!
Yeah, let me begin here.
You cast a spell on me,
The first time we met.
Bewitched and enchanted at first glance.
I didn't know then,
The spell that I was in.
Now I'm living in a trance.
Living in a trance.
In a world of lost romance,
I never had a chance.
Living in a trance.
Living in a trance.
Duhhh, duh-deh-duh...
Shhh! He's sleeping like a baby!
Is he asleep, or is he hypnotized?
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Who's there? Wait a minute, I'll see who it is!
Who's there? Come on, speak up, who is it?
- Nobody!
- Well, come on in then!
You a ghost?
Not yet, but, you durn near scared the life out of us!
Me too!
What are you doin' here?
We were just passing by,
And we thought we heard guitar music coming from this place!
Oh! That was me!
You live around here?
Just over the hill.
We figured, if it was a ghost,
It must be friendly if it plays the guitar!
What makes you think it was a ghost?
'Cause, this place is haunted!
Nobody comes near here!
Well, we've been here for quite a while,
And nothing has happened!
Huh! You're one of the lucky ones.
Oh, I don't think nothin' will happen!
Come on in and warm yourselves by the fire.
Okay?
Yup. There's all kinds of strange lights
And strange sounds always comin' on around this place.
Somebody comes in to see if they're real, leaving just like that!
Well, let's leave, just like that!
Oh Jeepers! Don't be a baby!
We haven't heard a thing!
Say! Aren't you
Woody Weatherby?
I'm guilty.
I knew it! He's a big star!
Thank you very much. I'm proud you heard of me!
This is Boots Malone.
- Hi!
- And, my manager, Jeeps.
Heard of you folks, too.
We play and sing a little.
How about singin' one for us?
We'd like to!
I feel like we're auditioning an act!
Well, you never know where you'll find good singers!
There is one song that we sing about this mansion,
And 'Old Tom Cat', one of the ghosts here.
Years ago, this song was made famous in these parts.
Now, old Uncle John had troubles of his own,
He had an old yellow cat that wouldn't leave home.
He tried everything he knew to keep the cat away.
He even gave it to a preacher and told him to stay,
But the cat came back...
The cat came back.
I thought he was a goner, but the cat came back.
'Cause he wouldn't stay away!
Now, he gave the old cat to a man in a balloon.
He told the man to leave him with the man in the moon.
The balloon, it busted, and everybody said,
Ten miles away they picked a man up dead,
But the cat came back.
The cat came back.
I thought he was a goner, but the cat came back,
'Cause he wouldn't stay away.
Bum-de-dum, bum-bum-bum-de-doo
Now the cat was a terror, and they thought it was best,
To give him to a feller that was headed out West.
The train went around a corner, and it hit a broken rail,
Not a soul aboard the train lived to tell the tale,
But the cat came back.
The cat came back.
I thought it was a goner, but the cat came back.
'Cause it wouldn't stay away.
Bum, bum, bum-by-um, bum.
Now the farmer on the corner's gonna kill the cat at sight,
He loaded up his gun with nails and dynamite.
Well, he waited in the garden
'till the cat came around,
And seven little pieces of the man was all they found!
But, the cat came back!
The cat came back!
I thought it was a goner, but the cat came back.
'Cause he wouldn't stay away!
Bum, bum, bum, bu-de-bum.
Bum, bum, bum, bah-bum.
Rrrrrrrarr! Bum!
- Oh wonderful!
- That's fine!
Really, that's good.
Can you sing any love songs?
- Sometimes.
- Would you sing one tonight?
The minute you're gone, I cry.
The minute you're gone, I die.
Before you walk out of sight,
I'm like a child all alone at night.
I stare into emptiness,
I'm filled with such loneliness.
The world goes from right to wrong,
The minute you're gone.
The minute you're gone I see,
How lonely a man I'll be.
My life would be oh so-blue,
If I couldn't be with you.
The minute you're gone,
I pray.
The minute you're gone,
I say,
Please don't stay away too long.
The minute you're gone.
Doo-doo-doo-doo.
The minute you're gone I see,
Oh how lonely a man I'll be.
My life would be oh-so-blue,
If I couldn't be with you.
The minute you're gone, I pray.
The minute you're gone,
I say,
Please don't stay away too long.
The minute you're
Gone, gone, gone.
Gone. Gone.
Oh! That was just wonderful!
(CRACKLING NOISE OF
BONES AND EERIE MUSIC)
Ah!
Why! There's nothing there!
You suppose, maybe it's mass hopitism?
- That's hypnotism!
- That's what I said!
Maybe we've all been working too hard!
Well, I for one, do not believe in ghosts!
And, I think we ought to investigate!
Isn't anyone coming with me?
(CREAK OF STAIRS
AND EERIE MUSIC)
- Arrrrhhh!
- Ahhhh!
Ahhhh!
What was it?
- Didn't you see it?
- See what?
That horrible looking thing!
Are you sure you saw it?
I think so! Oh, I don't know!
I heard a sound, and
I was so frightened!
Look, maybe we better get out of here while we can!
It could've been my imagination!
Well, between the three of us,
There's sure a lot of imaginating going on!
One thing for sure,
There's something funny about this house!
Well, I don't think it's so funny!
And, I'm not laughing at all!
(SOUND OF BONES
KNOCKING TOGETHER)
Oh! Maybe it's an owl!
An owl! Doin' what?
Draggin' a chain to his nest?
Look, I do not believe in ghosts!
And, there must be some explanation for all of this!
Where are you going?
To continue the search!
Look Boots, this is an old empty house.
I know there may be a few ghosts in here,
But I think we've searched long enough!
I think we ought to get out of here myself!
I'm with you!
- Wooodddyy!
- What's wrong now?
- I saw a, uh, uh...
- What? What?
- I don't know what it was!
- Well, I'll go check the car.
Come on!
Poor Jeepers! This isn't a very relaxing place for you, is it?
No!
My dear Dr. Himmel,
We have more important things to settle
Than your concern with that monkey.
- It infuriates me!
- Of course it does!
But, we've little choice in the matter!
I knew from the beginning, that it was a mistake!
That was not your decision to make!
Maximillian is my man!
Yes, of which you so consistently remind us!
From the moment we began this project.
You forget that I am the contact with Dr. Fu! Without me...
Without you, we might be much safer!
Indeed we might!
You've been warned again and again to use the secret entrance
Yet tonight, you walked right into the house
As if you were some neighbor on a social jaunt!
I saw a strange car,
And I decided to make an investigation.
Such foolish investigation endangers the whole project!
No matter what your authority,
You've no right to take such risks,
Especially since we're so close to achieving our goal!
You know perfectly well that we often have visitors
Who are curious to discover if this is really a haunted house.
The simple fact is, that if you had contacted us by radio,
We could have notified you of our visitors.
What is done, is done!
So, we are no longer safe.
You have always known this was not a safe business to be in.
But, tonight is our last night!
It's foolish to endanger the entire project!
Don't worry! Everything is going to be alright!
Bad news.
- Why? What happened?
- The car won't start!
- Oh no!
- Yippee!
Well, I guess we'll just spend the night here.
Jeeps, you can help me build the fire up some.
We'll bake it so it will last until morning.
And, I think we ought to stick real close together.
- Good thinking!
- Boots, I want you to...
Boots?
- Boots? Boots?
- Oh boys!
Here I am.
Come and see what I've found!
Where are you?
What do you mean runnin' off?
Well, I was just down this hall!
Well, we've got to stick together!
- Yeah! We got to tick together!
- I'm sorry!
We don't know what's goin' on in this house!
- Anything could happen!
- Okay!
Come on and see what I found!
When I open this door, you won't believe what's inside!
By now, I'd believe anything!
You're right! I don't believe it!
Isn't it beautiful?
Oh, I could spend forever right in this one little room!
It's so elegant!
Maybe this is the room of the great lady of the house,
That's been kept exactly as she left it!
Way back in the Civil War days, when she was a southern belle!
Gowns! Gowns! Beautiful gowns,
Satin, and lace from across the sea.
Gowns! Gowns! Beautiful gowns,
Bring back a precious memory.
Of summer nights,
Twinkling stars above,
A night so right
For people in love.
As we dance, dance,
I realize,
The gown I was wearing,
Hypnotized.
So I gaily
Danced through the night
In my lovely gown of white.
Loo, loo,
Loo-loo-loo.
Loo-loo-loo-loo,
Loo-loo, loo-loo.
Loo, loo,
Loo-loo-loo.
Loo-loo-loo-loo,
Loo-loo, loo-loo.
A summer night
Twinkling stars above,
A night so right,
For people in love.
As we dance, dance,
I realize,
The gown I was wearing
Hypnotized.
So, I gaily
Danced through the night,
In my lovely gown of white.
Ooh, ooh-loo-loo-loo-loo.
Loo, loo-loo-loo-loo.
Dream girl, we got to get out of here!
Oh, but it's so beautiful!
I could stay here forever!
Well, let's go.
Let me in! Is someone there?
Yes Madam Wong!
There are three of them.
What beautiful trespassers!
Ah, who are you?
I'm Woody Weatherby,
Boots Malone, and Jeepers.
Delighted! Now, tell me what are you doing in my house?
Oh! We didn't know it was your house!
I bought the
Beauregard Mansion,
So that I could restore it to its original beauty.
We didn't mean to trespass!
Well, never mind. Just tell me, what are you doing here!
Well, it looked like a storm was comin' up,
And we needed a place to stay.
Come! Let us leave this room.
Of course, you cannot stay here!
Haven't my ghosts bothered you?
Well...
- Are they real ghosts?
- Of course they are!
I told you we should have gotten out of here!
Ma'am, if you'll just let us spend the night.
You see, we're entertainers,
And we're on our way to
Nashville, Tennessee,
To do a Jamboree there.
And, I'm afraid our car won't start.
And uh, well, we're gonna have to wait until morning.
Tell me, what kind of entertaining do you do?
I'm a singer.
And, I pick a guitar.
How charming.
And, what do you do my dear?
I sing, and dance.
Ah, that's nice, nice.
Are you an entertainer?
Uh, no. Not exactly.
What are you exactly?
I are exactly his business manager.
What's goin' on?
I don't know, but, it looks phony.
They seem real nice to me!
I have decided that, uh, you may stay, at least for tonight.
- Well, fine!
- Let me warn you.
Stay in that room.
You'll be much safer.
We'll stay right by the fireplace.
Good!
We sure do, hey, they've gone!
- Where'd they go?
- They didn't go out that door!
You think, maybe she was a ghost too?
Sure seemed real to me!
Well anyway, she was nice
Letting us stay here and all tonight.
Well, let's settle down and try to get some rest.
All right.
Woody? Hey Woody!
- Hmmmm.
- You asleep?
Eyeah!
Boots? Boots?
Hmmm? What's wrong?
I can't sleep!
Oh, for heaven's sake!
Well, let us sleep anyway!
- For crying out loud, Jeeps!
- Watch T.V. or something!
Yes Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, for a terrific used car buy,
Hurry on down right now to Acme City Sales!
And now, for a full hour of country and western music,
Here's Merle Haggard!
I played a brand new record on the juke box.
And, I scarcely could believe the song I heard.
It told of how you left me for another.
It was almost like I'd written every word.
Someone told my story in a song.
The lyrics told that happiness had gone.
They told of how you done me wrong.
Someone told my story in a song.
The writer must have seen the way you left me,
For he told it all and never missed a line.
He told of swinging doors and a juke box.
He even knew I almost lost my mind.
Someone told my story in a song.
The lyrics told of happiness that's gone.
Then it told of how you'd done me wrong.
Someone told my story in a song.
Now, we give you Jim Kent.
Hi there shoes,
Are you the ones she wore last night?
Was she with him?
Did he hug and hold her tight?
Or, was she just out walking
Like she said,
Down by the sea.
Tell me shoes,
Was she stepping out on me?
Oh say there telephone,
Did he call here and talk to her?
Did he say, he'd meet her
- at their rendezvous.
- Woody?
Woody! Boots?
Did you hear her say,
She couldn't wait
To be with him.
Is that why she wasn't here
To answer you?
Hi there pretty dress.
Are you the one that she would choose?
While I called here,
Were you out with one or with two?
Did he put his arms around you,
As he held her tenderly.
Tell me dress, was she stepping out on me?
Woody?
Woody wake up!
Boots!
- Boots!
- What's going on?
For crying out loud, Jeeps!
Look at the T.V.!
Look at the television!
That's very nice, Jeepers.
Yeah, he picks a mean guitar.
Now, let's go back to sleep!
No! I saw these two weird faces on the television.
Ah hell, you're watchin' the late, late, show!
What late, late show?
Listen, I saw that
Chinese lady and her friend!
- Well, so did I!
- I mean on the television!
Jeepers, you're in bad shape!
You need a long, long, rest!
If you don't stop seeing things,
You're going to end up in the 'funny farm'!
Well, I saw something!
And, it looked like 'em!
Now, I'm hearing things!
They are entertainers.
- Oh really!
- Of course they are!
You take their word unconditionally?
They were carrying guitars, weren't they Matt?
Yeah! Two or three of them!
Anyone can play a guitar!
That doesn't make entertainers!
In fact, it could well be a cover disguise!
I believe, they're from the master organization
To halt enemy resistance!
M.
O.
T.
H.
E.
R.
Oh!
- He's right!
- Oh come now!
They are not 'Mother' agents.
I'll take care of them!
The torture wheel!
The rack! Hehehehe!
And, the iron maiden!
Effective, but primitive!
We have other methods.
Quicker and surer!
No! We must not waste time eliminating three,
Who are obviously nothing more than what they appear!
Then you still think that they're entertainers?
You don't want us even to question them?
I thought we had resolved that problem!
Well, I suppose we must bow to her judgment in this matter.
As long as I am in charge, you must!
I wish I could be as sure of them as you are.
Dr. Himmel will continue to observe them,
While I attempt to contact headquarters.
- Yes?
- Who are you?
Agent Ming Toy.
Thirty-eight, twenty-four, thirty-six.
Oh!
Let me speak to the Chief.
One moment, please.
Good evening, Dr. Fu.
Kreagar, have you the rest of the formula?
No, but Maximillian is leaving
Almost immediately with Madame Wong.
Let him make contact tonight
With the agent at the
Acme City Missile Plant,
At which time they'll receive the balance of the formula.
Excellent.
When we receive the balance of the formula,
We'll report back to you at once.
I will be expecting your call.
Meantime, may I suggest
That you have everything in readiness for the test.
Of course.
Well, now it's up to you.
I suggest that you keep in close radio contact with us.
We will. Come Max.
Anatole, I've got it!
He, he, he.
- Max!
- Huh?
Don't you realize we have important business?
- Yeah.
- Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Gentlemen! This is no time for disagreement.
Max, here's your laboratory smock, your identification card,
- and your badge.
Good luck.
- Yeah.
Woo! Woo!
Hi there! Working kind of late, aren't you?
Yeah.
You scientists really work hard.
Yeah, that's right.
Hey, you're new here, aren't you?
Yeah, sure.
I thought so. I didn't recognize your face. What project you on?
It's top secret. No comment.
Ooooh, that's alright,
I know all about them.
I been workin' here for five years.
The things I know, and the things I've heard,
You wouldn't believe!
I tell you one thing, if anybody wanted to be a spy,
The thing to do is become a janitor.
Janitor knows everything that goes on.
I ain't got time for conversation,
- now, let me by will ya?
- Sure. Sure.
I see you're cleared for top secret.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Hey, that's pretty good.
Of course, I'm cleared for top secret too.
Janitors have to be.
Well, I told you I ain't got time for conversation!
Now, let me by, will ya?
Locked out, huh?
It looks like it.
That's okay. Don't worry, I've got the key.
As long as you're cleared with security.
- Huh, huh, thanks a lot.
- Glad to help.
Hey, uh, ain't you forgettin' something?
Oh, that. Thank ya.
- Are you George?
- Yes.
- Do you have the formula?
- Yes.
Give it to me!
If you'd betray your country, you'd betray us.
Augh!
Oooooh! Owuoh!
Oooh!
No, no, don't try to say anything.
I'll, I'll get help for you.
Yeah, Chief? This is Jim.
My partner's just been shot.
Yeah. You'd better get an ambulance over here right away.
No, he hasn't said anything yet.
I'll follow through. You'd better hurry! Okay, will do.
- Now don't try to say anything.
- Ooh!
- Ooh!
- Take it easy.
The old Beauregard mansion.
Ooh!
The mission is completed.
- Do you have the formula?
- Yes.
That's what we've been waiting for.
I'll be glad to get out of this cold, damp cellar!
We both need a vacation, Kreagar.
- Um-hum, Florida.
- The Caribbean.
- Wait a minute.
Um, Mexico.
- Puerto Vallarta.
Ah, marvelous! Come on.
Let's call the Chief!
Just to let him know our mission was successful,
And we'll be calling with the formula soon.
I don't believe in ghosts.
I don't believe in ghosts.
I don't believe in ghosts.
I don't believe in ghosts.
I forgot about that door.
It looks as though he's waiting for someone.
Or, he may be initiating an investigation,
Whatever Madame may think.
Madame is not always right.
We may be making a grave mistake.
I don't think they're entertainers.
- They're not in costume.
- True. Quite true.
Yes?
It looks like we are being followed.
- Can you lose them?
- Of course we can.
- Are you alright?
- We lost them.
Imagination, that's probably what it was.
I wonder, perhaps we should question one of our visitors.
Hmmm?
What'd you say?
- You awake?
- Awake!
How do expect me to sleep,
With you rollin' around half the night?
Sorry about that chief.
It's a bad sign, Jeeps.
What were you talkin' about?
I don't know. That's the first time I heard it.
Well, when you figure it out, tell me all about it,
When I'm wide awake.
I'm telling you,
There's something goin' on in this house.
Sure, it's your uh...
Well, I can't be imaginating all of this!
I don't know. You've been doin' pretty good at it.
- Now, go back to sleep.
- I can't go to sleep!
You hear that?
That all depends on what it sounds like.
It sounds like somebody's moaning or somethin'.
- Yeah, the wind.
- Oh.
- What's that?
- I don't know. Let me see.
- Shutters?
- I don't think so.
Maybe nothin', huh.
It may be the branches
Hittin' up against the side of the house.
Yeah.
Help! Help me!
Naw, that sounds like somethin'.
- Imagination.
- No, that sounded like...
Boots?
- She's gone!
Well, don't panic!
- I'm not! I'm not!
Don't panic! We would have heard the door by the way it squeaks.
Let's try the hall!
Boots?
Boots?
Where are you, Boots?
Check the closet.
Anything in there?
Just a wierdwolf. A wierdwolf!
- Wait a minute.
- Well, what?
- We can't forget Boots.
- Oh, yeah.
What am I running for?
I didn't see anything!
Come on.
That stupid gorilla!
- (GORILLA MAKES NOISES)
- Oh shut up!
Don't pick on poor old
Anatole all the time!
He's not so bad.
Don't you remember,
I said just now that
We ought to question one of our visitors?
Yes.
Well, he must have heard us talking and he wants to help us.
The only smart thing he's ever done.
Huh, ha, ha, ha.
Jeeps, we've got to separate.
I'll go upstairs. You go outside and look around.
Okay.
- Say, Woody?
- Yeah.
You know, after really thinking about it
For three or four seconds,
Don't you think we ought to stick together?
You're not afraid, are you?
Well, I never won any bravery contest.
Why don't you take that hat off. It might be bad luck.
Oh, okay.
And, I thought the front was bad!
Man, it's spooky out here!
Boots? Ooh! Boots!
Hey, honey.
Boots, where are you?
Well, she's not out here.
- Let's go back in.
- Hold it.
I don't see anything.
Me neither, let's go back!
- They're getting too close!
- Then do something!
Did you hear something?
- Must be wind.
- Yeah, I guess so.
Move the ghost a little closer.
Alright.
Jeeps, I think something's behind us.
- You sure?
- I think so.
- You think we ought to look?
- I'm almost afraid to.
I'll count to three, then we'll both turn and look.
One, two,
Two and-a-half.
Three. Heahhh!
Come on Jeeps, hurry!
Jeeps!
- Jeeps, where'd you go?
- Woody! Help!
What're you doin' down there?
Well, I ain't lookin' for new talent!
They seem thoroughly frightened.
You should get rid of them once and for all.
If it doesn't work, we'll have to take drastic measures.
Should we question the girl now?
Let's wait, at least until Madame returns.
Are you afraid of her?
We're all dependent on each other in this operation.
Hmmm, we could still question her.
George, my dear friend, without Madame Wong,
We get no payment for our services.
I think it's imperative that we wait until she returns.
We could start questioning.
I have no intention
Of jeopardizing our position with Madame.
I suspect she'll be angry enough when she sees the young lady.
- It's not our fault!
- Yeah, I know, the gorilla.
Hey Woody. Man, I'm putting this hat back on!
I wonder where she went to.
Stand right where you are.
I suggest you raise your hands.
Very high. Higher!
- You idiot!
- The gorilla did it!
I told you to leave them alone.
Never-the-less, I decided that we should question one of them.
Perhaps you are right. Hmmm.
Do not scream, dear.
Maximillian has a nervous finger.
Perhaps you'd better answer a few questions!
We don't have time to answer questions.
Our girl singer is missing.
How long have you been contact agents?
The only agents we know get ten percent.
What does that mean?
That means, we're entertainers.
Now look, I've got to find my girl singer.
Hold it! What proof do you have that you're an entertainer?
My guitar?
Play!
Look, that girl may be in trouble!
If you're an entertainer, you can play any time, now go on!
Well, perhaps you are entertainers.
Now, would you mind telling' me what's happening?
Have you ever heard of M.O.T.H.E.R.?
M.O.T.H.E.R., that spells mother!
I know 'Mother McCree', and some other songs about mother.
M.O.T.H.E.R. is,
Master Organization To
Halt Enemy Resistance.
'Mother', hey that's clever, huh?
My name's Jim Meadows.
'Mother' agent number thirty.
We're after an organization whose sole purpose
Is espionage and counter-espionage.
They will contact and sell to anyone.
I thought that you were contact agents.
We wouldn't know a contact agent if we saw one!
Tell me one thing.
How did you get here?
Well, it's a long story.
Yesterday, we were driving down the highway
On our way to Nashville.
Alright, let's begin.
What's your name?
- Boots Malone.
- Boots Malone.
Her name is Boots Malone.
Is that all the information you got from her?
- That's all we asked.
- I'll kill her.
Oh Max, shut up!
It's my opinion that
Boots Malone is a code name.
Quite possible.
- Boots. Boots.
- What could that mean?
I don't know. Ahhh, Malone!
- Ma-lone.
- Ma, ma, that's it!
Ma is a colloquialism for 'Mother'!
She's a 'Mother' agent, just as we thought!
Now, lone,
Lone, I, o, n, e.
Got it! L-1.
She is 'Mother' agent L-1!
What are you talking about?
My mother's in Las Vegas!
You leave the interrogation to us.
You go make contact with headquarters.
And, Max give them the formula.
We have been waiting.
We have the balance of the formula.
Dr. Himmel will read it to you.
C-three, H-five, radical, 0-number-three.
- Is that all?
- No. There's more.
It would be much simpler if you'd talk.
Talk! Talk about what?
Four, immedasoli-bi-tholomaine.
Beta-ameno-thexalaine.
Could you repeat that please?
We have ways of making people talk.
H-five-radical,
0-number-three.
- Four...
- Come on.
Immedasoli-bi-tholomaine.
Beta-amenothexalaine.
Heh, heh, he, huh-huh. We have waited so long for someone.
- Heh, heh, hee.
- Help me! Somebody!
I don't know any of this. Aaaaahh!
Aaaaahhhhh!
Aaaahhhh!
Aaaaahhhh!
Aaahhh!
Now, I think perhaps you had better answer a few questions!
- Alright!
- Did 'Mother' send you?
I told you, my mother's in Las Vegas!
This is the bedroom of the lady that lives here.
Nobody lives here! This place has been for sale for years!
Well, there is somebody living here.
Maybe it's a ghost.
I'll have to see that before I believe it.
That's where we saw that wierdwolf, over there.
- In that closet there.
- I want to take a look.
Here's your werewolf.
Come take a look.
Here he is!
Well, that's sure going to a lot of trouble just to scare a guy.
This whole house is rigged!
We've got to get out of here.
Let's go find that girl.
Put her in there.
That'll make her talk!
Oh! Oh! No! Oh! Ahgh!
Help! Help! Help!
Help!
Help!
Help! Help!
We may have some trouble relocating all this
Equipment on our new assignment.
Well, let's start dismantling it.
No, we'd better wait until we get a report from Dr. Fu.
We should have heard from him by now.
There's no need to be anxious.
It'll take some time to put the formula through.
There are some elaborate tests to be made.
And, there are two parts to the formula.
Could you determine what the ingredients were?
No. Of course, I didn't have time to examine, it carefully.
There's some strange and unusual components.
Maybe something entirely new in atomic research.
Hmmm, let's see.
No. There's nothing here I recognize.
Do you think that maybe we should split up?
Well, alright.
Why don't you take upstairs.
I'll take the outside.
- What about me?
- Why don't you go with him?
Oh by the way, what does she look like?
Blonde, blue eyes, very beautiful.
You have been tricked!
This formula is a fake!
You gave me the formula for
Nitroglycerin and an antihistamine!
- How can that be?
- Are you certain?
We are certain!
Our contact must have been a 'Mother' agent!
It is too dangerous to stay there.
Move quickly to your next assignment!
Well, what about the girl?
Poor Max! How you would love to dispose of the girl!
- The girl can identify us.
- We can leave her here.
No one will ever find her.
No one will even hear her!
Help! Help!
Our next assignment is in Allamagoridore.
Oh! I'm looking forward to that!
The dry climate will be wonderful for my sinuses!
- But, I'll miss this house.
- It has been fun, hasn't it?
Perhaps, we could create another haunted house.
No!
Could we try the ghost just once more?
- No!

How can we be strangers, completely strangers,
When we were so in love just yesterday.
On the night that we met,
It was true love at first sight.
You held me in your arms,
And your arms felt oh so right.
Our love seemed to blossom,
As the days grew windy, dear.
And, you went away and filled my heart with fear.
And now, we're strangers,
Completely strangers.
I just can't believe you'd take your love from me.

This old smoke-filled bar is something I'm not used to.
But, I gave up my home to keep you satisfied.
I just called to let you know where I'll be living.

And a juke box, and a barstool.
My new home has a flashing neon sign.
Stop by and see me anytime you want to.
'Cause I'm always here at home 'till closing time.
I've got everything I need,
To drive me crazy.
I've got everything it takes to lose my mind.
And in here, the atmosphere's just right for heartaches.
Thanks to you I'm always here 'till closing time.

Now, I'd like to introduce somebody to ya,
That I've known for a few years. As a matter of fact,
We worked together when she was about eleven years old,
Out in California.
She was real cute then, now, she's even more beautiful.
Let's make her welcome,
Miss Molly Bee.
Heartbreak U.S.A.
The harbor's empty.
My love has gone.
With aching heart I face
The cold and lonely dawn.
Until the trade winds
Bring him home to stay,
I'll live in heartbreak U.S.A.
Don't let those geisha girls
Get your heart in a whirl.
And, if you meet some sweet frauline,
Remember, you're mine.
Don't forget your sweetheart
While you're away.
Back home in heartbreak U.S.A.
U.S.A.
Sometimes I'm lonely,
And time stands still.
And, I wonder if you feel,
The way I always will.
So darling write me,
Letters every day.

Don't forget your sweetheart
While you're away,
Back home in heartbreak U.S.A.
In heartbreak U.S.A.
Back stage while ago,
Cricket Stone and myself were talkin' about
Singers and all that, and we tried our best
To get this next fellow to sing a song.
We finally talked him into it.
Make him welcome, the good Jeepers!
And they got into the wrong house again last night.
I bought myself a house a few months back.
And, it's a darlin' little house, that's a fact.
How-some-ever, there's a certain seven others there that's exact.
And, would you believe, I got in the wrong one again, last night!
My neighbor's got a dog about two feet high.
Cutest little dog, wouldn't hurt a fly.
One day, I stumbled in their house by mistake,
This mornin' about five.
And, that cute little, stupid dog nearly ate me alive!
I came in last night, and felt like I had two heads.
And, I was sneakin' in the house,
When this sweet voice yelled out and said,
Oooh Bill darlin',
Put out the kitty cat, and come to bed.
And I said, Oooh, surprise, my name's Fred.
I went to the next house, and knocked on the bell.
And, this guy about eleven feet tall answered the door and said,
What the... And, I said, well
I was just sorta in the area,
And I thought maybe you'd like to chit-chat for a spell.
But, he threw me out the back door, and called me some names.
So I went to sleep in the next house,
And I saw it looked about the same.
I woke up this morning with my arms around a great dane.
Some silly kid lookin' in the door, yellin' Gravy Train.
And, I got into to the wrong house again, last night.
Sure am glad I'm me!
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Here's somebody that needs no introduction,
But, I'm going to introduce her anyhow.
My part time lover,
Boots Malone!
- Kill them baby.
- Thank you.
Well now, on Monday
I'm your darlin',
On Tuesday I'm your baby,
But on Wednesday you don't get around to me.
I don't want a part time lover.
Can't take a part time lover.
Won't have a part time lover, no siree!
I need your huggin',
I need your kissin'.
It's your huggin' and your kissin' I've been missin'.
Now, if I'm not your one and only,
I'd rather go on feelin' lonely,
'Till the day the right one comes my way.
I must refuse a part time lover.
Can't use a part time lover.
Got to have a full time lover every day.
- I need your huggin'.
- Need your huggin'.

Okay Red, take it off.

                GOOD MORNING.
OH, GOOD MORNING, LOUISE.
   IT'S NICE TO SEE HER ENJOYING
          HERSELF FOR A CHANGE.
      THE MOOD AROUND THIS PLACE
            ISN'T GOOD FOR HER.
AH, SHE MAY BE RIGHT.
                  ESPECIALLY
              AN AMERICAN GIRL.
  YOU CAN TELL SHE'S BEEN RAISED
                 ON PROMISES.
           WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
                 ABOUT THAT?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
     ABOUT THAT?
             I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
[ CHUCKLES ]
 I SAW YOU SQUIRMING
WHEN MOTHER READ THE WILL.
YOU GAVE JOHN ENOUGH DIRTY LOOKS
TO GIVE HIM A HEART ATTACK.
          DON'T JOKE ABOUT THAT.
                   YOU KNOW
             HE HAS A BAD HEART.
                 [ CHUCKLES ]
      BUT I KNOW YOU DIDN'T MEAN
               ANYTHING BY IT.
     YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU OUGHT
              TO SPEND MORE TIME
           WITH YOUR WIFE-TO-BE.
YOU'RE AN INTELLIGENT WOMAN,
       LOUISE.
  YOU NOTICE THINGS,
   SIZE PEOPLE UP.
YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE HAPPY
AND KNOW WHEN SOMETHING'S
   BOTHERING THEM.
 I WANT YOU TO DO ME
   A LITTLE FAVOR.
                  OF COURSE.
KEEP THAT MICROSCOPE YOU'VE
GOT BUILT INTO YOUR EYE
      OFF OF ME.
    I'LL SEE YOU.
        [ BIRDS CHIRPING ]
          THIS WILL TAKE YOU IN,
                  ALL RIGHT.
      OH, THERE'S PLENTY OF VIEW
                FROM UP THERE.
        MUST BE VERY INTERESTING
              TO KNOW ABOUT ALL
         THE SECRET PASSAGEWAYS.
 OH, I KNOW THEM ALL.
I'VE BEEN HERE 20 YEARS.
                  20 YEARS?
                HOW WONDERFUL.
      AH, WELL,
 YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.
YOU GET USED TO A FAMILY
AND YOU GET TO LIKE YOUR ROOM
AND YOU GET TO KNOW THE RUN
    OF THE HOUSE.
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
THERE YOU ARE -- 20 YEARS.
                YOU MUST HAVE
               BEEN HERE, THEN,
                  WHEN, UH,
              THE LITTLE GIRL...
       AH, YES.
THAT WAS A SAD THING,
      THAT WAS.
     LORD HALORAN
WAS A MUCH-LOVED MAN,
AND HE INVITED ONE OF
 THE COUNTRY FELLOWS
UP HERE FOR HIS WEDDING.
  OH, A BIG WEDDING
     THAT WAS --
    A BIG BANQUET,
AND EVERYONE INVITED.
SHE WAS ALL DRESSED UP
  AS THE BRIDESMAID,
RUNNING ABOUT TO HER HEART'S
CONTENT ALL OVER THE PLACE.
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A WEDDING
     HERE SINCE.
               WHAT ABOUT KANE
                 AND RICHARD?
WELL, IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS,
BUT I WOULDN'T BE BETTING
YOU'D SEE ANOTHER WEDDING HERE.
 WELL, I MUST GO BACK
       TO WORK.
        [ FROGS CROAKING ]

 Kane: BILLY? BILLY?
BILLY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
               OH, HELLO, KANE.
OH, SURE, SURE, I'M -- I'M FINE.
          I WAS JUST REMEMBERING
               ABOUT KATHLEEN.
      KATHLEEN?
OH, YES, THE LITTLE GIRL.
   RICHARD TOLD ME
    ALL ABOUT HER.
        WE USED TO PLAY TOGETHER
                 RIGHT HERE.
   SOMETIMES I THINK I CAN STILL
              HEAR HER LAUGHING,
               JUST LIKE THEN.
    IS -- IS THIS
  THE POND WHERE...?
                     YES.
      SHE WAS MISSING ALL NIGHT.
            MOTHER WAS FRANTIC,
          ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLE.
              THE NEXT MORNING,
      WE FOUND KATHLEEN FLOATING
  IN THE WATER RIGHT OVER THERE.
  I'M SORRY, BILLY.
            NO, KANE, I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT ALWAYS SO MORBID.
IT'S JUST THAT THE FUNERAL
  CEREMONY IS TODAY.
                 IT'S A VERY
               BEAUTIFUL POND.
      YOU KNOW, THIS IS ALL JUST
         EXACTLY LIKE I IMAGINED
              IRELAND WOULD BE.
  IT RAINED THE DAY
   OF THE FUNERAL.
WE STOOD AROUND HER GRAVE
UNDER BLACK UMBRELLAS,
AND THEN WE THREW FLOWERS
UNDER HER LITTLE HEADSTONE.
    MOTHER LOOKED
   AT THE FLOWERS,
AND THEN SHE COLLAPSED.
      EVERY YEAR
IT'S BEEN THE SAME --
THE UMBRELLAS, FLOWERS...
AND MOTHER'S COLLAPSE.
         BUT THAT WAS YEARS AGO.
 WHY DO YOU KEEP HAVING THE SAME
  CEREMONY OVER AND OVER AGAIN?
 THERE'S SOME THINGS
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, NOT YET.
MOTHER'S PROBABLY WAITING.
   IS RICHARD READY
  FOR THE CEREMONY?
                I DON'T KNOW.
     I THINK HE'S IN HIS STUDIO.
                HE SAID HE HAD
           A SUDDEN INSPIRATION,
        SOMETHING ABOUT WANTING
    TO FINISH A STATUE BEFORE --
  ALL RIGHT, SIMON,
    I'VE SEEN YOU.
COME OUT OF THERE NOW.
   [ Irish accent ] I GIVE UP.
  YOU CAUGHT ME FAIR AND SQUARE,
          MASTER BILLY.
        I GIVE MESELF UP.
SO, IT'S POACHING AGAIN,
   ARE YOU, SIMON?
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU --
YOU JUST ABOUT SCARED THE WITS
OUT OF POOR MISS KANE HERE.
 SHAME ON YOU, SIMON.
    SHAME ON YOU!
            'TWAS ONLY
    OLD BUSHY TAIL I'M AFTER,
        MAY HIS SOUL ROT.
     I SWEAR BY THE SHADE OF
    FINN McCOOL, MASTER BILLY.
         I'M NOT POACHING
         YOUR LEGAL GAME.
       NO, 'TWAS ONLY THAT
   NO-GOOD RABBIT-STEALING FOX
      WHICH BRINGS ME HERE.
      PLEASE, MASTER BILLY,
        FOR THE MEMORY OF
    YOUR LATE, GREAT FATHER --
       GOD REST HIS SOUL --
DON'T TURN ME OVER TO THE BULLS.
OF COURSE NOT, SIMON,
BUT DON'T LET ME CATCH YOU
RUNNING AROUND THROUGH THE BRUSH
   AGAIN LIKE THIS.
  NOW OFF WITH YOU.
    OH, GOD BLESS YOU, MY BOY.
  IT IS A TRUE SIGN OF THE LATE,
    GREAT LORD OF THIS ESTATE,
             YOU ARE.
        FORGIVE ME, MISS.
   THE LAST THING IN THE WORLD
    OLD SIMON WOULD WANT TO DO
          IS TO FRIGHTEN
     A FRESH YOUNG BEAUTY...
          LIKE YOURSELF.
                 BYE, SIMON.
OLD SIMON LIKES TO THINK
      OF HIMSELF
AS THE LAST OF THE GREAT
   IRISH POACHERS.
   ISN'T THAT DANGEROUS, RUNNING
   AROUND WITH A GUN LIKE THAT?
I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN FIRED
    FOR 30 YEARS.
  I'M NOT EVEN SURE
     IT'S LOADED.
    WELL, THEN HOW DOES HE CATCH
          ANYTHING, OR DOES HE?
WELL, HE SETS OUT SNARES
     FOR RABBITS,
     AND WHEN HE
  FINDS THEM EMPTY,
     HE BLAMES IT
  ON OLD BUSHY TAIL.
OLD BUSHY TAIL'S A FOX,
     OR AT LEAST
   SIMON THINKS SO.
  NOBODY'S EVER SEEN
   OLD BUSHY TAIL,
 AND I DON'T THINK
 SIMON HAS, EITHER.

        WHY DON'T YOU GO TO BED,

 I WILL IN A MINUTE.
  YOU'RE GONNA GET ALL DEPRESSED
      SITTING HERE BY YOURSELF.
   DID YOU EVER SEE
  WHERE MY ROOM IS?
 YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN
      A CORRIDOR
 WHERE NOBODY'S LIVED
FOR THE PAST 50 YEARS,
THEN UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS
    WHERE MY GREAT
GRANDUNCLE OR SOMEBODY
TRIPPED AND BROKE HIS NECK...
AND THEN PAST THE SPOT
 WHERE MY GRANDFATHER
DIED OF A HEART ATTACK.
I'D RATHER BE DEPRESSED HERE
    THAN IN THERE.

 THEY'RE MORE STRANGE
    THAN TERRIBLE.
I'M ALWAYS A LITTLE BOY,
 AND I'M IN MY ROOM.
      IT'S LATE.
I HEAR SOMEBODY OUTSIDE MAKING
A KIND OF A SCRAPING SOUND.
  I GET OUT OF BED,
LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW,
  AND THERE'S A MAN
CLIMBING UP THE WALL,
    COMING CLOSER
  TOWARD MY WINDOW.
I YELL FOR MY MOTHER,
AND SHE COMES INTO THE ROOM
JUST AS THE MAN IS COMING IN
 THROUGH THE WINDOW.
I HOLD ON TO HER LEGS,

     I'M SO SMALL
I ONLY COME UP TO HER WAIST.
       THE MAN
  IS IN THE SHADOWS.
YOU CAN ALMOST RECOGNIZE HIM,
   BUT NOT REALLY.
HE SAYS THAT HE'S INSANE
AND THAT SOMEONE ELSE
IN THE ROOM IS INSANE ALSO
 AND THAT HE'S GOING
   TO NOD HIS HEAD,
  AND WHEN HE DOES,
THAT OTHER INSANE PERSON
 WILL NOD THEIR HEAD.
      HE NODS...
    AND I LOOK UP
    AT MY MOTHER.
  AND SHE'S NODDING
      HER HEAD.
     AND THEN...
 SHE STARTS LAUGHING
        AT ME.
 AND SHE PICKS ME UP
     IN HER ARMS,
AND RUNS OUTSIDE AND...
THROWS ME INTO THE POND.

Thank you, Mrs Hudson.
My God!
A member of the medical profession caught red-handed, Dr Watson? What?
Your indignation implies familiarity.
My dear Holmes, you cannot think me familiar with a maniac who stabs a woman in the street in Whitechapel!
What was the name of the prostitute? Polly Nichols. ..How did you know she was a prostitute?
Where is my damn pipe?
You haven't seen a newspaper!
The stop press of the third edition of the Times is printed at 3.30am.
The news must have come in at about 3am.
In the street, her body cannot have remained undiscovered for long, so I deduce that it happened about 1am.
It doesn't explain how you knew she was a prostitute.
No respectable woman would be out alone in Whitechapel at that hour, so she was not respectable.
You make it seem so simple.
Holmes.
There was an identical murder of a woman in Whitechapel three days ago. A second murder!
That IS interesting. Why?
Because it IS the second murder.
Now, would you mind standing up? Why?
Once the impossible is eliminated, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the solution.
And? Therefore, you are sitting on my pipe.
Incredible! Elementary, my dear
Watson. And now...Whitechapel!

It's me - Annie Chapman!

"Police baffled. Jack the Ripper vanished into thin air."

They're here! But not running.
The person who rang does not desire entry. He is deliberately slow.
"He"? It might be a woman.
The British postman is not a woman.
A parcel for you, Mr Holmes.
Incredible, Holmes!
Thank you, Mrs Hudson.
Postmarked "Whitechapel".
Surgical instruments.
Who sent those? What is missing?
The large scalpel.
The postmortem knife.
There's no greater satisfaction than to have a theory confirmed.
Do they tell you anything?
First, the obvious.
A medical man has fallen on hard times. Is that obvious?
Instruments of one's trade are pawned last. How do you know they were pawned? This fleck of white.
Silver polish. No surgeon would clean his instruments with it.
Someone else was concerned only with appearance. This is substantiated by these chalk marks.
This is the ticket number.
They were stolen, then pawned.
The pawnbroker would not have put them in a window. It faces south in a narrow street. Business is bad.
The pawnbroker is a foreigner.
I cannot see... On the contrary! You see everything but observe nothing.
This faded when the sun was at its height, able to shine over the roofs opposite.
A narrow street, facing south.
Business is bad. The case lay undisturbed. How can you tell the pawnbroker was foreign?
The 7 is crossed, Continental-style.
The address is scrawled with difficulty - the writing of a woman who seldom puts pen to paper.
A woman? Undoubtedly a female hand.
Ah, but I am slow! This has more secrets! Where are my tweezers?
The velvet on the lid has been added recently.
The coat of arms of an elder son of a duke. Bring Burke's Peerage. Yes.
Wait here, cabbie. Right, sir.
This way, gentlemen.
His grace will be with you in a moment. Thank you.
To what do I owe the dubious pleasure of this visit?
No doubt you will recognise this coat of arms, your grace.
Where did you get this? I believe it to have come from a Whitechapel pawnshop. Pawnshop.
No more than I predicted for him.
For whom, sir? My elder son Michael.
Do you know his present address?
He is dead.
Oh. Of what accident?
Disobedience. From the day he left, against my wishes, he has been dead.
You mean disowned.
Was he a doctor, your grace?
No, but that was his ridiculous ambition.
The medical profession is honourable.
To a certain class - not to one of the Osborne family, a man who would have become the 10th Duke of Shires.
- Any trade must be dishonourable.
- A TRADE, sir?!
- The servants will show you out.
Pompous ass!
Trade, indeed!
Did not Burke's Peerage say there were two sons? Yes. Give me that.
How clumsy of me!
Allow me.
This belongs to Michael!
Where is he?
I'm afraid I don't know, Lord...
Lord Carfax. Sherlock Holmes.
My colleague, Dr Watson.
Why have you got my brother's instruments?
They came into my possession in a singular fashion. Your father...
My father is still very bitter.
When did you last see your brother?
Two years ago. He went to study in
Paris. These were my gift to him.
He wrote a couple of times, then...
You tried to trace him? I went to
Paris but he'd left and returned to
England. And you've heard nothing?
No. ..No.
Or seen him? Of course not.
Thank you. Good day, Lord Carfax.
Come, Watson. May I?
Good day.
Whitechapel, cabbie. Yes, sir.
Why Whitechapel?
To find the pawnshop.
The instruments were sent after the murder of the third prostitute.
A woman wishes to interest me in the crimes. I find that provocative.
Give us a penny, Mister!
Here.
A narrow street facing south.
Observe, Watson - a foreign name.
Uncanny.
Gentlemen, can I help you?
I want information on an article you had in your possession.
No, I don't think...
Come, Mr Beck.
Your face reacts faster than your brain. You remember.
I would like to know who pawned this.
Who are you, to demand information?
Sherlock Holmes.
Who pledged this case?
The pawn ticket number was 872.
Well...
The name given to me was...Osborne.
Osborne? That's the name that...
Angela Osborne.
Did the lady leave an address?
"Lady"! Two years ago. Yes.
The Montague Street Hostel. It's a soup kitchen run by Dr Murray.
When did you sell this case?
A few days ago. Yes, yes.
It was last Saturday.
Ah - the night of the...
Of what, sir?
To whom did you sell it?
A man. I never saw him before.
Was the missing instrument here when you sold it? I think so.
You are sure?
Of course!
I have reason to assume a connection between this and your local murders.
Murders? You don't think I have...?
That's slander. Talk like that can get you sued.
No, sir. It can get YOU hanged!
Accessory before the fact.
Supplying a weapon for murder.
A very good day to you, sir.
Holmes! Where are you rushing to? To examine the body of Annie Chapman.
The dead girl? Why?
To confirm that the instrument used was a surgeon's scalpel.
Give us a penny!
Lestrade! Mr Holmes - what are you doing here?
The Inspector will help us through officialdom. Hmm. What do you want?
To look at Miss Chapman's body.
Out of the question.
I will not argue. I hoped to help prevent the fourth murder. Watson.
Just a moment. What makes you think he'll do it again? I think he will,
Lestrade. I think he will.
All right.
May I?
My God! Could a human being have done this?
You see, Watson. Hmm.
We are right in assuming that two weapons were used?
That's correct, Mr Holmes.
A long, bayonet-type knife and a sharper, more meticulous instrument.
A razor, or perhaps a surgeon's scalpel?
A scalpel would be more probable.
I agree. You know my name, although
I do not believe we have met.
I heard your lecture to the Royal
Society on forensic medicine.
Brilliant. My name is Murray.
Dr Murray.
You run a soup kitchen nearby.
A hostel for the destitute. There's plenty of them in Whitechapel.
I also overwork as a police surgeon.
Did you say a bayonet?
I think so.
Without a doubt. ..I was a military surgeon in Afghanistan.
Oh, aye.
The idea of a bayonet appeals to you. It narrows things down.
Soldiers have bayonets, don't they?
Plenty of soldiers come down to
Whitechapel for fun with the girls.
I would hardly refer to this as fun.
Before you arrest the entire garrison of the Tower of London, remember a scalpel was also used.
You can't arrest all the doctors.
Discount the military theory. Why?
The killer would be covered in blood.
A soldier would be detected at once.
No - look for someone living alone close to the scene of the murders, who can either return home quickly, or hide his outer clothes safely.
Prepare yourself for more murders.
You keep saying that!
There is no motive for the murders so there is no reason to stop.
That is only conjecture.
All circumstantial evidence is conjecture. It is often right.
Mr Holmes is usually right.
221b Baker Street, please, cabbie.
Someone should have sent for us.
Someone has - the woman who sent the case.
Why isn't she in the open?
She uses a woman's art - intrigues us to Whitechapel.
There is a small service
I would like you to do for me. Yes?
Visit Murray's hostel to see Angela
Osborne. They will say she is not there. Say she is. Create a scene.
Create a scene? What do I do then?
Then, Watson, you leave, of course.
Guide me, O thou great Redeemer
Pilgrim through this barren land
I am weak but thou art mighty
Hold me with thy powerful hand
Bread of heaven
Bread of heaven
Feed me now and evermore
Feed me now and evermore.
You have to sing for your supper here.
...the verge of Jordan
Bid my anxious fears subside...
Be told, mate. If you don't sing, they don't give you no grub.
...and hell's destruction
Lead me safe on Canaan's side...
Go on!
If you don't know the words, make a noise.
Songs of praises
I will ever give to thee
Give to thee
I will ever give to thee. Amen.
You won't get no soup.
I did not come to partake of the soup.
God has sent you down his manna!
We'll fit you in somewhere.
Will you please stop this unwarranted interest in my diet!
I do not want any soup!
Can I help you?
Yes, I'm sure you can.
Sorry. My name is Watson.
Dr John Watson of Baker Street.
I am looking for a woman who is staying here.
Her name is Angela Osborne.
There's no-one of that name here.
She IS here.
I am certain of it.
You'd better speak to my uncle. Mary!
This way.
Hello, Watson!
What are you doing here?
Come to help us? Good!
Dr Watson is looking for someone called Angela Osborne.
I said I've never heard of her.
What makes you think she is here?
She gave this hostel as her address in a business transaction. When?
About two years ago.
Names mean nothing here, Watson!
Girls change their names as often as they change their clothes.
I can't help.
I'm certain she's here.
I'M certain she's not!
You saw the people outside.
I'm their only doctor.
I haven't time to answer questions about lost women.
I know she is here.
I demand to see her!
"Demand" be damned!
Will you leave my surgery?! But...
Please, Dr Watson!
Well!
Forgive my uncle. He works even at night. His work IS these people.
I insist on seeing Angela Osborne!
I will not be put off!
Please!
Something is very wrong! Saying you haven't heard of Angela Osborne!
You haven't seen the last of me!
I will not rest till I have found out what you have done to this girl!
Dear, dear...
What are you doing? I've come to converse, not for fisticuffs!
Who the devil are you?
Sherlock Holmes. You may remember we met yesterday.
Sherlock Holmes? Wouldn't we be more comfortable in here?
What's all this about, Holmes?
How did you get here? I followed this young lady. I saw no-one.
That happens when I follow people.
Why did you follow Miss Young?
She left when Angela Osborne was mentioned, as I expected.
YOU sent Dr Watson!
You'd better tell me the whole story. It's none of your damned business. There's nothing to hide.
As I said, I went to Paris and found my brother had thrown up his studies and returned to England.
For weeks I tried to find him, but...
Then, one night, a man came to see me. He said that Michael had married a prostitute.
Blackmail.
He threatened to tell the papers?
He was far cleverer than that.
He threatened to tell my father, who had just suffered a severe heart attack.
You've met my father. The family name is the meaning of his life.
Surely he is a man of the world?
The OLD world. The shock would kill him. So you paid?
Are you still? The blackmailer came back three times.
I refused to pay until he told me the whereabouts of my brother and his...
That woman he married.
He said if I visited the hostel,
Michael would be waiting.
Was he waiting? No. But I met
Dr Murray, and...I met Miss Young.
I told them my story.
Michael had been helping Dr Murray.
He gave me the address of his lodgings but I found that he'd left.
No-one has seen them since. And your blackmailer? He bought himself a tavern - the Angel and Crown.
Did YOU know Michael Osborne? He left the day before I came to the hostel. It's a wretched story.
The good thing was that Edward -
Lord Carfax - became interested in my uncle's work.
His money has kept the hostel going.
I saw Dr Murray's fight against the poverty and sin.
It was the least I could do.
He bought this house, to be near.
I'd be grateful if you would mention none of this to my father.
There is one more thing.
What branch of medicine was your brother studying?
His ambition was to be a surgeon.
Food is dear, rent is dear
Love is cheap for the time of year
So grab the nearest miss
And whisper while you kiss
In...these hard times
You've got to put up with anything
In these hard times
You mustn't pick and choose
# If you'renice and squeeze her tight
She'll ask you round tomorrow night
If you don't mind sitting without a light
In these hard times
Farmer Brown came to town
To the cattle show
Went to wet his whistle
In the Hotel Cecil
Lady fair saw him there
All her neck and shoulders bare
Said Farmer Brown, "Alack!"
As he saw her dainty back
In...these hard times
You've got to put up with anything
You mustn't pick and choose
This dress you wear
Leaves your neck and shoulders bare
Lucky to be dressed up to there
In these hard times
Mrs Green, rather mean
Went out last Saturday marketing
And saw right in the gutter
A codfish on a shutter
Felt its gums, poked her thumbs
All round the fish
And said, "Oh, crumbs!
It don't look nice at all!"
Then the coster had to bawl:
In...these hard times
You've got to put up with anything
In these hard times
You mustn't pick and choose
The codfish there's a sacrifice
And, Ma'am, would YOU look nice
If you had been torpedoed twice?
In these...hard...times.
Come on, out you go.
I've had enough of you. Out!
Holmes, you delight in embarrassing me! You invite me to dine then bring me to a low East End pub!
You'll bring light into their drab lives.
Welcome to the Angel and Crown. This way.
Sit down, please. We have always a warm welcome for guests.
So I see! What would you have?
Cognac.
Coo-ee!
You see the interest you're causing in the fair sex.
Here you are, gents.
Will you join us in a drink, Mr...?
Steiner. Max Steiner. Dick - a glass.
A bad night. Everyone's scared off the street after dark.
These ladies come in for safety?
Here is always a selection - if you're so inclined.
A selection.
A selection? We did not come here for this reason!
Then I can do nothing.
You can give us some information.
Information? What about? About the disappearance of Michael Osborne.
What did you say your name was?
My name would alarm you, Mr Steiner.
You're a copper.
Consulting detective.
My friends at Scotland Yard would be interested in you.
Watch what you say. Answer me or my friends will put you in the dock!
Who are you? Sherlock Holmes.
Seen Lord Carfax, have you? You know
Angela Osborne well, I take it?
How did you know? You had to have an accomplice in blackmail.
Compensation. I could have opened my mouth and collected from the press, or kept it shut and collected from Lord Carfax.
I did the nobility of England a service.
Lord Carfax compensated me for my loss of business from the newspapers.
The governor of Brixton Prison will not call it compensation.
Angela was on the streets when you met her? Born to it. Loved the game.
Most of them start because they have to. Not Angela.
Met her at the gangway when my ship tied up. I took up with her.
And again when she returned from Paris with Osborne? His wife!
I always said she got her face and name from the angels and her heart from the devil.
You don't know what happened to her? Disappeared from the face of the earth.
Well, gentlemen...
That's all I can tell you.
What possessed Michael Osborne to marry such a creature?
Because she got her face from the angels.
One of the most attractive women I ever met was hanged for murdering three children for insurance money.
What do you think became of
Angela Osborne? That scoundrel said she disappeared from the earth.
And yet... And yet...
Do you think Michael Osborne is dead? I never theorise without evidence, Watson.
It puts the estate in a mess - if the duke should die with no proof the elder son was alive or dead.
Watch your back. I saw movement in the shadow a moment ago.
Brisk work, Watson! Brisk work!
Upon my soul, Holmes! When you take a guest out for the evening you really do it!
My apologies. Next time I'll take you to a quiet table at the Cafe
Royal. I should jolly well think so.
Nothing like a piece of cold steel, eh, Holmes?
'Ere we are.
Here's one.
Two legs, even!
Wotcher!
Cor! Sailor's rest!
We've walked a mile for that.
Working up an appetite.
The girls are indoors.
Scared to come out!
Must've known we was in port!
Don't worry. Jack and me, we'll look after you!
'Ere, don't fight over it, lads!
You girls were told to clear off the streets.
I've got to earn a living!
Clear off, lads - go on.
Miss - don't you live that way?
You coppers are ruining everything!
Push off!
Thanks to Jack the Ripper - yes, thanks to this brutal killer - the world is watching Whitechapel.
It's not the killings by a demented hand that the world finds horrible.
It's the murder by poverty.
The murder by misery, the murder by hunger!
In Whitechapel...
Whitechapel... the cry of the starving, the moan of the sick!
We've tried to get one paragraph in the papers to expose what happens.
I've been myself to editors, hat in hand. It's not news, they said.
Pah!
Well, now it is news!
One man has made us news!
We'll have a riot. He's putting up this murderer as a deliverer of Whitechapel.
To seize a defenceless female, to stifle her cries and then...
How can anyone do this?
Someone does.
Why? Why?!
A motive, sir? I'll tell you.
His motive is the punishment of Whitechapel, as God destroyed
Sodom and Gomorrah!
I'll have to shut him up.
No - you'll have to rescue him.
It is the social and moral crimes that must be ended in Whitechapel, not just the killings!
Yes! It is the dealers in vice and the purveyors of sex that the police must throw their force against, not just the killer!
I tell you there can be no peace in Whitechapel while licensed dens like the Angel and Crown... cater to the dissolute and the debauched!
Prime Minister - the Home Secretary.
How's the battle?
The Leader of the Opposition has found the culprit. You.
Gladstone is in form.
I was afraid of that.
I could see you were in for trouble.
Not just me. He'll demand that the Commissioner of Police resigns.
If he calls for a vote of no confidence, he might get it.
You mean YOU might have to resign?
Not I - just some of my ministers.
Should we go down? As you please.
I'm expecting a visit from Mr Holmes.
That charlatan! Mr Mycroft Holmes is an valuable servant of the Crown.
As long as he doesn't bring in his brother Sherlock. I shall ask him to.
Why not approach him direct? Your department has antagonised him.
HE has antagonised THEM.
He has been grossly offensive.
Mr Mycroft Holmes. Show him in.
Please try to be discreet.
It isn't going to be easy.
Mr Mycroft Holmes will wish to take charge of the investigation.
Prime Minister.
You know the Home Secretary.
And I will soon know your successor, unless the police do a better job.
I have confidence in them.
There are none in the Commons.
I sent for you because you have the tidiest brain in the Civil Service.
I cannot deny it.
Knowing that you are engaged on the most delicate negotiations about the Peruvian copper concession...
You wish me to ask my brother to help apprehend the Whitechapel murderer.
- How did you know?
- The early hour of the summons suggested a personal matter.
The Home Secretary's presence suggested a connection with the murders.
The fact that the Peruvian matter has been settled for three days made me suppose you wished to consult my brother, so I have arranged to meet him.
You mean you had anticipated my request? That, Prime Minister, is my business.
My Indian vase! Just look at it!
I wish you'd find some other way of solving cases!
My dear Mycroft! This is a surprise! Watson, some sherry.
I expected you to ask me about the
Manor House case. I thought you'd be out of your depth. No, I solved it.
It was Adams, of course? Yes.
I knew that from the start.
Thank you. Mycroft, is this a social call? Oh, yes. Purely social.
How are you? Very well.
Now the social call is over, let's get to business. I see you have come from the Prime Minister. Why?
You are not at your desk. You are dressed for Buckingham Palace but the Queen is at Balmoral.
This must be urgent.
What does the Prime Minister want?
To find the Whitechapel murderer before he brings down the government.
But... Any government which allows such poverty deserves riddance.
Nor will I be engaged in political manoeuvres.
Another glass of sherry? Thank you.
Inspector Lestrade must have urgent news.
He's written to us! A letter!
Try to be coherent.
Who has written? Jack the Ripper!
You're already involved!
A case of detection means more than any politician's career. Read it.
"Dear Boss, I keep hearing that the police have caught me.
"They won't fix me yet.
I have to laugh when they talk about being on the right track.
"I am down on whores and won't rest until I do get buckled.
"I love my work.
My knife is sharp. I want to get...
"to work right away. Good luck.
Yours truly, Jack the Ripper."
It was sent to the police? A news agency. It will be in tomorrow's papers. No - orders from up top.
Every crank in the country would write to the papers. If it does not appear, there will be more killings.
Why do you suppose he sent it to the news agency? For publication.
Perhaps he's sickening of his crimes. Is he bluffing? No.
If his motive is to create fear, he's trying to achieve it without further killings.
If we publish it we add to the fear.
The government wants to avoid that.
You are asking them to aid him. If it does not appear, he will return to the knife. They MUST publish!
Orders - it cannot be published.
Then put every man you have on the streets of Whitechapel.
We've come to view the body of Miss Elizabeth Stride.
With your permission. Be careful.
Her head is almost severed.
Have you found any clues yet? We've scoured Whitechapel, but nothing.
He left no bloodstained garments?
No - if it is a he. A woman?
The constable who found the body saw a woman... Correction.
He reported seeing a woman's shape.
What difference?
What he said is not what you said.
A woman's shape in the fog could be a man in woman's clothes.
I hardly think it likely...
There is no pattern of behaviour in a deranged mind.
What can you tell us, Dr Murray?
Each murder is by the same hand.
What about of the knifework? What?
Does it not show surgical skill?
It's the work of a doctor?
Anyone with a modicum of medical training could do it.
A medical student, perhaps?
These murders are the work of a madman, but with medical skills, intelligence and education.
Intelligence? Education? This?
Yes. Take that letter. The grammar and syntax, though concealed, were the work of an educated man.
The writing was deliberately scrawled. We must not take the mask for the face.
If you're right, Mr Holmes, it brings us back to the doctors.
Don't be too sure, Lestrade.
Oh, well, I'd better be off.
I suppose he'll arrest the entire staff of the London Hospital.
Would YOU look for a doctor,
Dr Murray?
There is one medical student who will soon be under suspicion. Oh?
Michael Osborne.
What's he got to do with it?
Medical student who lived locally, had good cause to hate prostitutes, and has vanished.
He has nothing to do with the murders. That may have to be proved.
The newspapers will relish the heir of the Duchy of Shires denying he is Jack the Ripper.
Consider his family and tell me what happened.
I have every consideration for his family, so I must say nothing.
I should have refused the request to call in my brother.
He was already engaged, with what result? Stalemate.
I should have realised only one person could solve this - myself.
I should have ditched the Abyssinian detente and the Nigerian loan. I...
Stop sawing away on that! It was a sad day when Mother gave it to you.
A sad day for all of us!
It's his method.
Method?!
This butcher boy has us all on the edge of a knife! This morning three more men were attacked in the street.
Carrying bags?
Carrying Gladstone bags!
They say he's a Russian.
Rubbish...!
Military intelligence has found no truth in the rumour.
How long has this been going on?
Hasn't spoken since yesterday.
How long does it usually last?
Sometimes days.
I'm wasting my time!
I shall never understand why you've had that violin so long but never learnt to play it!
Act, Sherlock, act! Go to the scene of the crime! Use your powers!
Interview people! As Mother used to say, stir your stumps!
Don't bother to see me out, Watson.
Remind my brother he has never had so great a chance to serve his country, or seemed so unaware of his responsibilities!
Or of the intention of the composer when he wrote that tune!
He's quite right.
You've rejoined the human race!
I should be in Whitechapel. There will be another murder tonight. Eh?
Come. We will scour the streets.
What for? The detail that matters.
This is hopeless, Holmes.
If he were ten feet away, we wouldn't see him.
Fog to the murderer is like jungle to the tiger.
It conceals him until he pounces.
What do we do? We must continue.
Jack the Ripper will not allow these conditions to go unused.
He is out now, Watson.
'Ello, love!
You look like a sport.
Do you fancy coming up?
Couple of shillings'll do it.
'Ang on a minute.
I'll throw you down the key.
Catch!
Shut the door behind you.
Can't take no chances with Jack the Ripper about.
You know something? I ain't been out in the dark for a month cos of him!
Come on in, then!
Come on.
'Ere.
That's a lovely coat you've got on, innit?
Could you make that ten bob for a special, Mister?
I do want to please you.
I haven't had a real gentleman like you since I started.
Don't think
I've been on the game that long.
I'm proper new, I am!
Holmes! Quickly, Watson.
Lemon Street Police Station.
Tell Inspector Lestrade to cordon off the area.
Hello! What are you doing here?
Chasing a shadow. How long have you been here? Since midnight.
No-one's passed through here?
Here?
Hello, Edward. Sorry I'm late.
Mr Holmes? I came to see your uncle.
Dr Murray is in the surgery. He asked not to be disturbed. Did he?
I'll take you home.
Just a minute.
Dr Murray?
Oh, Holmes!
I'm sorry. I had a long postmortem on a poison case. I'm a bit tired.
What are you doing here?
Following Jack the Ripper. Here?
He eluded me in the mortuary.
The mortuary?
He could have got into the hostel. He did.
We will wait here for the police.
What makes you think they are coming here?
You are the police surgeon.
They will bring the body.
Another prostitute?
I would welcome the opportunity of a little chat. What about?
About Michael Osborne. I told you before... He wasn't wanted under suspicion of murder before.
What do you mean? It all leads to his knowledge of surgery.
He could not have murdered anybody!
Prove it!
Tell me about the night he found out his wife and Max Steiner were blackmailing his family.
You know about that?
Michael Osborne was one of the finest young men I've ever met.
In the six months he was here,
I came to respect him as I've respected few other men.
You've heard about his wife - vicious, depraved creature!
He stayed with her in spite of everything.
One night, she brought Steiner here, to this very room.
Michael heard from his wife's mouth their plan of blackmail. He was to be part of it. What happened?
Michael refused to have anything to do with it. There was a quarrel.
Steiner attacked him.
He had no chance.
The sight of her husband being beaten wasn't enough for that woman.
She was about to throw a bottle of acid at Michael. She didn't?
It's hard to know what happened.
Maybe Steiner flung out an arm.
But the acid... went into her own face.
When Steiner saw the horror of it, he rushed out to get me.
Her angel face was a diabolical sight.
I did the best I could for her.
A week later, Steiner took her away.
I've not seen or heard of her since.
Michael Osborne got away?
Then why weren't the family, the police informed?
He didn't die, Holmes. Not quite.
Go on. Finish your story, Dr Murray.
Come and see, Holmes.
Finish the story yourself.
You wanted Michael Osborne.
Here he is.
Whether it was Steiner's blows to the head, or whether his mind could suffer no more of the world, I don't know.
This is how he's been since that night.
How can Lord Carfax let his brother remain here in that condition?
He doesn't know, Holmes. Nobody could recognise that poor creature.
Why keep it to yourself? You should inform his father! What father?
He disowned him for wanting to do good instead of wasting his life in the pleasures of the aristocracy!
He had a right to know. What about
Michael? He must be happier here than in a padded cell!
No - his life is over.
Let the world leave him in peace.
That may not be possible. Why?
You can't suspect that poor lunatic! All possibilities have to be considered.
Dr Murray? Yes? Inspector Lestrade sent me for you, sir.
Lestrade, my dear fellow!
Are you not well?
You'll see nothing like it this side of hell.
What animal could have done this?
Prepare yourself for a shock,
Dr Murray.
Come, Watson.
Aren't you going to examine the body? There is a more important examination.
I'm coming! Stop!
Always these drunk people!
What the hell do you want?
You're asking for trouble!
No. We're giving it!
I want to see the owner of this doubtful establishment.
You've got a nerve, coming to see me at this time in the morning!
The owner, not the hired help! Tell
Angela Osborne I want to see her.
You are not going upstairs.
Now there are several things
I may do, Mr Steiner! All right.
But give her a chance.
Let me warn her.
Warn her?
You can't just walk in on her.
Not the way she is.
Come up.
Please sit down, Mr Holmes.
Dr Watson.
You will forgive the inconvenience of the hour.
Night and day are indistinguishable here. A lamp turned down is my morning sun.
What do you want, Holmes?
Out with it.
Excuse Mr Steiner's lack of hospitality. We never receive guests.
Mr Steiner's hospitality is noted for the lengths he will go to to provide comfort for his guests.
It is profitable. I hope you won't spoil it. It is of no interest to me.
Then why are you here? To ask the lady what she did with the knife.
Knife? The one you removed from the set of instruments you sent me.
You are all I expected of you.
Give it to him, Max.
It is a limited life in these rooms and I spend hours reading your cases.
I am grateful for the excellence of your narrative, Dr Watson.
Can you tell an admirer, Mr Holmes, how you knew I sent the instruments?
Someone wanted to interest me in Michael Osborne.
The writing on the label was that of a woman with little education.
How did you know I was here?
I was told that you had been...
Mutilated.
Made odious to myself and to the world. It was obvious why you'd gone into hiding.
Why remove the scalpel from the case?
- To intrigue Mr Holmes.
- We have only your word for that.
I believe the doctor thinks
I am Jack the Ripper.
Why should Angela murder those women?
Of course, Dr Watson is observant.
I hate all women. He knows why.
They're all prettier than I am.
That's why.
The woman with the ugliest face in the world. Want to see?
But I WAS beautiful.
Eh, Max?
Ja. You were.
You can say it, Mr Holmes, that I hate women.
But I am not your killer.
As you can see, I am incapable of even stepping into the street.
Why did you hate your husband so much? Who told you that?
Dr Murray.
To him, Michael was a saint.
To me, a man who tired easily.
He seemed unbalanced.
He couldn't take the discipline of medical study, or marriage.
He tired of me and sent me back to work. You mean on the streets?
His father had cut him off.
I didn't earn enough. He thought up a way to get money from his brother.
His was the blackmailing scheme?
Who else?
He sent Max to Carfax because his father would never give him a penny.
Michael's father knew him for what he was - a vicious, worthless libertine.
Vicious? If you call a man who throws acid into his wife's face vicious, because she can bear him no more and is leaving him. Wasn't that vicious?
By God, Holmes, there's a woman of great character.
I'm afraid you're not probing deeply enough. Her scars extend beyond the surface.
What do you mean? She may well believe her story to be the truth.
Now let us pick up Michael Osborne.
You know where he is?
Come along, Watson.
Father, Mr Sherlock Holmes is here.
I was not aware I had an appointment. You must prepare yourself for a shock.
Mr Holmes has brought Michael back.
I have forbidden your brother this house, Edward.
I have not altered that.
But... Do not argue.
Your grace. You were shown out of my house on your last uninvited visit, Mr Holmes.
I have come to save your family name. Tell him to get himself out of the mess.
I cannot do that, your grace.
He is not capable of understanding.
Of course he can understand!
Your son is a pathetic imbecile, incapable of understanding the smallest action.
He has suffered for his sins.
He is outside that door.
I have brought him home.
Edward. Yes, Father?
Have Michael put into his old room.
Of course.
Do it yourself. It's better.
Not the servants.
And tell him...
I shall come and see him presently.
Mr Holmes. Your grace.
How did you find him? His identity was revealed by a doctor in a hostel for the destitute, his mind by a lady in a public house, the Angel and Crown.
I am indebted to them both.
Thank you, Mr Holmes.
Holmes... you know, don't you?
You know who Jack the Ripper is.
Who is he?
I must keep that from you a little longer. Won't you arrest him?
Knowing is not proving.
We can't let him roam the streets.
No. We have work to do before the final curtain can be brought down.
We have been setting the scene for the last act of Jack the Ripper.
I wondered what we'd been doing.
- Anything?
- No, nothing.
Good evening, Lord Carfax.
Max!
Angela!
How did you get out, Holmes?
I am well-known to be indestructible.
I would not miss this excellent partridge. How did you know...?
How did you know it was Carfax?
Oh, Holmes!
His medical knowledge.
When I dropped the case of instruments in his father's house, he picked it up. Natural politeness.
He put the instruments into the right niches. How odd, I thought.
A layman might ponder for a moment.
Carfax did not hesitate.
But isn't it obvious Dr Murray...?
Nothing is more deceptive than an obvious fact. The letter was obvious AND revealing.
That harum-scarum diatribe in red ink - revealing?
Precisely. The writer described his murders as his work -
"I love my work".
He was obviously a man of means who had no need of ordinary employment.
Dr Murray, who works hard, might have put "pastime". I ruled him out.
You make it sound simple. It was.
In the Osborne family, I found insanity through four generations.
Carfax's reason hung on a thread.
That his brother should give the
Osborne name to a common prostitute broke that thread.
Carfax was protecting the family name.
He'd never seen Angela but thought he could kill her by elimination.
He searched for her with his knife.
But Lestrade and the police...?
They do not know the identity of Jack the Ripper.
We need not disclose it.
The Osborne family have suffered enough.
Lestrade has three buckets of ash but we will keep the name.
Parcel for you, Mr Holmes.
Postmarked "Nottingham".
A-ha, the game's afoot again.
This is three years old. The flat brim with curled edges came in then.
It belongs to a man who has suddenly gone down in the world.
He is middle-aged, goes out little, with grizzled hair which has been cut in the last few days. Also...

Destroy All Monsters
United Nations Science Committee
Space Port II
The 10th century is nearing its end.
The UNSC has established an exploration base on the moon.
Rockets depart for it every day from this base on Iwo Jima.
Moonlight SY-3 ready for takeoff.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero!
The UNSC has also constructed a giant undersea farm in the vicinity of the Bonin Islands.
All manner of fish are cultivated here, and on the surface is Monsterland, a research habitat of fearful giant monsters.
Godzilla is there.
Along with Rodan.
Anguirus is also present.
Mothra and Gorosaurus live in peace here as well.
If they attempt to leave, it activates a restraint system.
In other words, a variety of scientific walls tailored to their instincts and traits contains them.
The reason Rodan can't fly beyond a set boundary at sea is that a perimeter of magnetic barriers has been set up.
Moreover, enough food is cultivated here for the monsters that they can each eat their fill.
Monsterland and the undersea farm are controlled automatically from a control center built deep underground.
Yes, CHX should work fine.
Everything is in order.
Don't the monsters look rather cute from above?
Yes, very.
That's a relief. I feared you'd run away, this being your first encounter.
Oh no.
I hope you'll help us as we closely study them.
Yes, sir.
Long-distance call for Kyoko Manabe.
Please go to box 4.
Hi.
Oh, Katsuo!
Where are you now?
The moon base.
This is an expensive call.
Yeah.
I was worried when I heard.
But I'm doing fine, as you can see.
I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about how you'll treat Godzilla.
Oh.
As it turns out, a monster lives on the moon too.
Really?
Just joking.
We're not sure what it is, but we're concerned. I'd like Dr. Yoshida to come.
The director is in
Tokyo for a conference.
Then once he's back...
Hello? Hello?
What's wrong?
Hello!
Hello!
Power station! Power station!
This is the operator.
Power station, what's wrong?
We have no idea.
Look, every control system is down.
Inconceivable.
Perform a thorough systems check.
How's the incident-analysis circuit?
It's not running!
What happened?
I don't know.
Doctor!
It's gas!
Come on, this way!
Having suddenly lost contact with Monsterland, the UNSC in Tokyo immediately launches an investigation headed by Dr. Yoshida, using communication satellites.
Number 006 is now showing the Bonin Islands.
Zoom in.
Yes, sir.
We can't. We're still being jammed.
Try again. Don't give up.
This is deliberate sabotage.
Deliberate sabotage?
But who? And why?
Doctor, we got through.
That's Monsterland, but I hardly recognize it.
Did new volcanic activity cause this? l doubt it. Zoom in more.
Yes, sir.
What's happening?
What is that?
This was definitely a planned attack. l doubt any of our staff survived.
This is the Moscow broadcasting office.
This is an emergency broadcast.
Rodan has attacked Moscow.
Rodan?
At 11:25 AM today.
It appeared above the city and is even now continuing its rampage of destruction.
This must of course be the same Rodan from Monsterland on the Bonin Islands.
Rodan is in Moscow?
What's going on here?
This report is coming to you from Paris.
A subterranean monster has just appeared from the Arc de Triomphe.
The pride of Paris...
No, the world's treasure is about to be destroyed by this monster.
The monument is collapsing. lt's been destroyed. Paris is being destroyed by this subterranean monster.
The world's major cities are being destroyed one by one by giant monsters.
Rodan is in Moscow,
Mothra is in Beijing,
Manda is in London, and Baragon is in Paris.
We've just received a new report.
Godzilla has appeared in New York.
Godzilla is in New York.
How do you explain this, Doctor?
How did the monsters escape?
Weren't they all contained before this?
Gentlemen, we regret that people suspect we are concealing information about these monster attacks.
What about you, Dr. Yoshida?
All I can currently do is give a warning, as if this were a natural disaster.
The monsters will keep rampaging, so everyone must remaim fully alert.
Silence please! What I mean is
I'm as ignorant as you right now.
I have the same questions you do.
I have no answers right now.
One question, Doctor. Why hasn't Tokyo been attacked when it's closest to Monsterland?
I'd very much like to know why myself.
If anyone can tell me, please speak up.
Moonlight SY-3.
Moonlight SY-3!
This is Moonlight SY-3, over.
Return to base.
Has something happened?
You'll see. Hurry back.
Hey!
Follow that!
Yes, sir.
It won't get away today.
But we need to get back.
This is more important.
That's a UFO out there.
It's dangerous to get any closer.
What is that?
Moonlight SY-3!
Moonlight SY-3, what's wrong?
Damn it. Go.
This seems completely backwards.
I don't know what's happened on Earth, but it's absurd to ask us for help.
They didn't ask.
What then?
It's a recall order.
We'll guide you once you enter the atmosphere.
You'll land at Monsterland on the Bonin lslands.
Proceed directly underground.
Only you and your ship can do this job.
And all of you should be armed.
Armed?
Yes. Be very carefuI.
Understood.
Trajectory good.
Receiving guidance beam.
Roger that.
Stand by for atmospheric entry!
Reverse thrusters, check.
Entering atmosphere!
This is Moonlight SY-3. We've just arrived at the control-center entrance.
Good. Someome may have commandeered it.
Ascertain their identity and objective.
Be careful. They may resist.
Roger.
No sign of radioactivity or sulfur dioxide.
All right, let's go.
Look sharp.
Yes, sir.
Look!
Systems are up.
What's going on here?
Welcome.
Kyoko! Doctor!
Hello again.
Why are you here?
I didn't expect you to come.
What's all this about, Doctor?
Let's relax and talk this over.
We want you, our young scientists and engineers, to understand and cooperate.
Cooperate?
Cooperate nothing. You let all the monsters free while Director Yoshida was away.
They're not running free.
We have them under remote control.
Remote control?
Take a look.
Mothra is currently near Beijing.
Godzilla is in the Pacific.
Rodan is over the Urals.
We can call them back to this island anytime we want.
I'll introduce you to the inventor of this remote-control system.
Follow us.
Welcome, gentlemen.
I imagine you have lots of questions.
I am not your enemy.
With your help, I want to establish a new scientific civilization on this planet.
How does destroying our cities establish anything?
You should listen to everything she has to say, Katsuo.
Kyoko!
We will establish our new civilization.
Some degree of sacrifice is unavoidable.
What?
Where are you from?
Kilaak.
Kilaak?
It's not on Earth.
There are countless asteroids between Mars and Jupiter.
She's from one of them.
You believe that story?
Belief doesn't matter. I admire her scientific knowledge and creativity.
It should be obvious from the monster remote-control system.
Her science is far superior to ours.
Okada, stand down!
Now do you see?
That barrier is completely unbreakable.
What are you doing?
Getting you out of here.
Where's everyone else?
They're all well, and happy to keep working.
Call them.
Don't you see? 
It's no use resisting.
All right, fine. We'll just take you two with us for now.
We'll carry you out if we have to.
Now walk!
Gas! Hurry!
Stop right there!
What are you doing?
Get off me!
Hurry!
It's closing!
Hurry it up!
Move!
Captain!
C'mon.
Hurry up!
We have masks!
Don't let her escape!
Take him to the ship!
Yes, sir!
Kyoko! Kyoko!
Captain! Captain!
Fall back!
Fall back!
Captain! Captain!
Captain!
Okay, let's move!
Was it brainwashing?
Is that what they did to you?
You're not giving us any answers to our questions.
Listen, Otani.
The only way we can help is if you answer.
Don't you get that?
"I don't know" isn't good enough.
Major cities are still being destroyed!
We sent in some UN troops, but the island was already deserted.
Where's their new base?
Please, tell me.
We can't continue to hide you from the UN's secret police.
Our friendship won't make any difference to them.
What shall we do?
Doctor!
Hands off.
It's you!
Are you Kilaak underlings now?
You'll understand soon enough.
We've come to get you.
You too.
There's no point in moving him now!
Stay still.
We should handcuff him.
It's the secret police.
Retreat.
We need to go!
Halt!
Scalpel.
Was he hard of hearing?
No.
Then it isn't a hearing aid.
It's some kind of metal I've never seen.
There must be some kind of radio receiver inside it.
But why was there a receiver implanted in his body?
Doctor. Isn't this how they're controlling the monsters?
I agree. Dr. Otani was being controlled the same way.
Yes. They came to get him for fear we'd find this.
There must be a transmitter somewhere.
If we can detect the signal, we can jam it.
Contact the commumications lab.
I'll search from the air.
This signal's fishy.
Figure out where it's coming from!
Yes, sir.
It's coming from Japan's central mountain region.
Look, I'm busy.
However rare this is,
I don't have time to look into it.
Yeah, but still...
Officer!
Something's flying up there.
Over there.
Where?
There!
It's that!
What is that?
R-Rodan!
No, it's not. Let me see.
Over there!
That's the moon rocket SY-3.
SY-3?
We went to the moon with Takeshi that time.
That's right.
Is he doing well?
Yeah.
Can I help you?
We're investigating a signal.
Go right ahead.
Excuse us.
What's that?
It's a radar.
Please observe this object, which appears to be a stone.
The UNSC has confirmed it as the Kilaak monster-control device wreaking havoc upon our world.
What's more, they're being discovered in the most unexpected places.
The cliffs of Dover.
The steeple of a church in Spain.
One appeared to be a clump of ice in a ravine in the Alps.
One was even discovered in a coconut on Guam.
Dr. Yoshida will now explain its capabilities.
This is a transceiver with an incredibly complex computer built in.
We estimate its effective broadcast range to be about 2,000 km.
So the monsters are likely being controlled by devices in their respective areas.
Regarding the Kilaaks and their prisoners from Monsterland...
They've likely returned to their countries to carry out their plans.
We ask for everyone to assist us so we can find them quickly.
Former Monsterland technicians
Mimoru Kudo, age 35.
Tetsuo Ise, age 30.
Shin Kuroiwa, age 28.
Kyoko Manabe, age 23.
All Japanese citizens.
Technician Michael Dawson, age 32, British citizen.
Elmer Hughes, age 19.
Thank you, miss.
You can go.
We beg your pardon.
Thanks, you can go.
Excuse us.
Thanks, you can go.
Please take shelter!
Rodan is circling over areas VII and VIII.
It's finally come to this.
The evacuation seems smooth.
It does.
New target sighted.
Godzilla has appeared in area I.
What?
Manda!
Manda has appeared.
Prepare to attack.
Prepare to attack.
All right.
Open fire.
I didn't expect Tokyo alone to stay safe, but Rodan, Godzilla, and Manda all at once?
Indeed.
New York, London, Moscow... It's been one monster for each city till now.
Emergency update, emergency update.
Mothra has appeared in area V.
Integrated Defense Headquarters
Liaison Conference Center
We really got hit hard.
Tokyo is in ruins.
There were four monsters. But the Kilaaks are more interested in the Izu peninsula.
Izu?
We've lost contact with merely every hot spring in Izu.
Just like what happened at Monsterland.
Do we have proof the Kilaaks are behind it?
There's a subterranean monster at Amagi.
Baragon?
Do you know why every major city except
Tokyo was attacked in the first place?
They were diverting our attention from
Japan while they set up a base under Izu.
No wonder. They must be using a new control device now.
Yes, and we must locate exactly where they are.
I want you to perform a focused underground survey with your SY-3.
Then find a breach we can launch a subterranean attack through.
Good to see you again.
Thank you, Doctor. Good to see you.
It's Kyoko Manabe.
Why are you here?
Let's talk elsewhere.
No, I want to talk to all of you here.
I know what you have to say. Don't tell me again!
Even if you don't want to hear it, the others will.
Especially the reporters.
Where did you come from?
From the Izubase.
What base is that?
A base the Kilaaks established as a foothold on Earth.
You're here as their messenger?
Yes. lf you recognize their residency rights and negotiate toward coexistence and coprosperity, they will return all the monsters to the Bonin Islands.
Amd if we don't, they'll destroy us with the monsters.
That's coercion, not negotiation!
I'm talking to everyone here. You be quiet.
Come here.
What are you doing?
Calm dowm!
You're being manipulated!
Stop fighting me!
Doctor!
She was being controlled with these.
They controlled the Monsterland employees and monsters, and killed Dr. Otani with this.
Doctor.
This is another new type.
We'll investigate them immediately.
Kyoko! Kyoko, wake up!
Kyoko!
Good, you're awake. It's me.
We'll get you patched up in no time.
It's all right.
Miss Manabe, this is urgent.
We need you to tell us about the Kilaaks and where you've been.
Kilaaks?
That's right.
In which part of Izu is their base?
I...
I...
Yellow poison gas!
She has no memory of when she was being controlled.
All right then.
Now entering target zone I!
Ground troops are in position!
Okay.
Prepare to attack.
Here we go, men!
Yes, sir!
SY-3 has begun its decent!
Good.
Godzilla's in our landing zone!
Halt descent!
Emergency ascent!
Emergency ascent!
Emergency ascent!
All right.
Open fire!
Hey, what's wrong?
We're being jammed!
It's Anguirus!
What?
Damn...
Operations halt! Operations halt!
Damn it.
Back to base.
What a shame.
They outwitted us again.
Hey.
Do we follow?
Yeah.
It's descending near Mt. Fuji.
Looks like it's tied to the Kilaaks.
Determine where it's landing.
Yes, sir.
Rodan's behind us,
15 degrees to our left!
Captain, running away sucks. Let's fight back.
It's not time yet.
It won't follow us where there's no air.
Prepare to leave atmosphere!
Preparing to leave atmosphere!
Main engine, full throttle!
What an escort Rodan makes.
Now we've lost our target.
No, we have a rough idea.
I'm sure they'll find the Kilaak access point if they search all over Mt. Fuji's western side.
Advance!
Keep advancing!
Third platoon, keep advancing!
Godzilla!
S-Spread out! Spread out!
Fan out!
First platoon, take the left forest road!
Second platoon, to the right!
Third platoon, follow second platoon!
This way!
What's wrong? Get up!
You okay?
I'm all right.
Let's go.
Must go pretty deep.
Let's go in.
Damn it...
It won't budge.
I bet it's a Kilaak cave.
Our only choice is to move forward.
All right.
Okay, get back. I'll shoot it.
It's no use.
It's good to see you again, Mr. Yamabe.
Welcome, Major Tada of Defense Command.
We summoned you here today on important business.
Summoned?
I knew it.
They're here, all right.
That's them!
Yes, that was our spaceship you saw on the moon.
Do you believe now that we're aliens?
So what's the important business?
A proclamation.
Proclamation?
Please listen carefully,
Major Tada in particular.
Earth doesn't belong to humans alone.
The area beneath the Mt. Fuji volcanic chain now belongs to the Kilaaks.
Invaders will be driven back by force of arms. Understand?
What?
Damn it.
Let's go.
Yeah.
Meanwhile, at Monsterland on the Bonin
Islands, the control center was running again.
The staff was hard at work analyzing the monster-control devices that had been gathered from around the world.
So it is the moon.
That's the true source of the signal!
We'll send SY-3 to the moon.
Don't land!
And don't take off those spacesuits till you deal with the Kilaaks.
Proceed to the target.
Understood.
Take a look at your chart.
Yes, sir.
I'll indicate your destination.
41 degrees north, 4 degrees west.
The Cassini crater, south of the Vallis Alpes.
Watch out for UFOs and approach from a low altitude.
We'll be on our way then.
Our approach vector is 45 degrees to port.
From the Sea of Tranquility to the Sea of Vapors.
Down the western side of Montes Apenninus, then north from palus Putredinus.
That'll bring us to the Casaini crater.
Roger.
There's a UFO 45 degrees to our starboard aft.
We've been detected?
It'd be surprising if we weren't.
What do we do?
We either do this or turn around.
Either way, circumstances won't get any better than this.
Okay, let's do it. In an hour's time we'll either be successful or dead!
One minute to target!
Full stop.
Full stop!
Prepare to descend.
All right, here we go. Descend!
Descending!
Full stop!
Full stop!
Prepare the rover!
Preparing the rover!
Close the fuel valves!
Fuel valves closed!
Activate cooling system!
Activating cooling system!
Temperature still climbing!
Hurry!
Coolant pressure?
At max!
What? Max?
Yes, sir!
What's wrong?
It's no use. At this rate, the fuel tank will explode!
Should we launch?
No time. We'll attack from the rover!
Yes, sir!
Halt!
Halting!
Prepare to fire maser cannon!
Masercannon, ready to fire!
Fire!
Commander.
SY-3 is in combat on the moon.
We detected a flare at Cassini.
All right, get in touch with the moon. I hope this works.
We still don't know if it worked or not!
I'll report as soon as they come back alive.
This is the moon base, over.
Ignore it!
Yes, sir...
If they fail, we'll be the next to die.
We might get vaporized along with this base before long.
Let's just relax amd have some coffee.
Yes, sir.
Let's get out.
Yes, sir!
Okada, Yoshikawa, Arima, come with me. Fujita and Tani, stand by.
Come on.
Arima and Yoshikawa, inspect the equipment.
Dismount and disable anything important.
Understood, sir.
I didn't expect the maser to be this effective against them.
Even the most advanced science will have some weak point.
Hey.
Over there too!
It's the Kilaaks.
They can nearly survive in high temperatures.
When we destroyed the wall, the temperature dropped.
Are they dead?
I'm not sure.
Captain! Captain!
Gather them up.
Yes, sir.
This is the control device's core.
Damn thing's still running.
Let's dismount it.
We'll take it back to Earth.
Yes, sir.
Moon base. Moon base!
No answer?
None at aIl.
The base won't answer, and the signal's still there.
Did they fail?
Do you think they failed?.
Damn.
It's not working.
Time for the final option.
Let's detach the excavator!
Yes, sir.
What's going on?
Detach the maser.
Right.
Get a high-voltage cable!
Okay. Open it.
Yes, sir.
Screwdriver.
Okay.
Let's go!
Hurry!
Given how long it's been since that irregularity was observed on the moon,
I think our only choice is to assume they failed.
Okay, switch it on!
What's wrong?
The circuit caught on fire!
I don't care! Turn it on and up!
We can't go back if we do!
Don't think about that! 
Turn it on!
Yes, sir!
It worked!
The KiIaak signal vanished. Hurry!
It's our turn to control the monsters.
Yes, sir.
Hurry! You can bet the Kilaaks on Earth noticed this!
Is it still alive?
Yes, it is.
But it needs a temperature in the thousands to become active again.
Is it living metaI?
Yes.
Now we know why they were after the Mt. Fuji volcanic chain.
Their scientific prowess far surpasses ours, but they're very few in number.
It probably takes thousands of years to grow to this state.
Thousands of years?
Don't they have a life span?
No. At constant high temperatures, they can probably live forever.
Forever?
That's right.
But at low ones, they quickly become like this.
Now we know how to attack them.
Heavy use of freeze rays.
Major Tada, draw up a plan.
Yes,sir.
Godzilla!
Again?
Doc!
You're there?
Yes.
Excellent. You've done well.
Doctor, this is no time for that!
Godzilla just showed up!
What? Are you serious?
Godzilla has appeared in Tokyo?
Yes.
You don't say. Our control device is complete, so we thought we'd test it on Godzilla.
So he's back in Japan.
Then, Doctor...
The monsters are on our side.
They'll obey humam commamds.
We'll mobilize them all in the Mt. Fuji region ao they can trample the Kilaak base!
There isn't a cloud today over Mt. Fuji.
It and the primeval Aokigahara forest are silent, as if awaiting the impending full-scale giant-monster attack against the Kilaak base.
The defense forces are already in position.
There are still no monsters to be seen.
Will the first to arrive be
Godzilla? Rodan? Anguirus?
We still don't see them.
We still... Oh, there's one!
It's GodziIIa, far off in the lower right, beyond the Yoshida Asama Shrine forest.
No, it's Minilla.
Minilla is the first to appear.
Following him, we have the king of monsters, Godzilla.
Now Mothra has appeared.
Mothra is approaching from the same direction as Godzilla.
Next to appear is Anguirus. It's Anguirus from the Asagiri Plateau on the left.
Truly a sight to see.
Following Anguirus are Manda,
Baragon, and Gorosaurus.
Kumonga's here too.
One after another, they're bearing down on the Kilaak base here in Aokigahara.
Rodan is too. Flying over Lake Motsu with the Southern Alps in the horizon.
Rodan's now over Lake Kawaguchi.
He's landing near Godzilla and Mothra.
Will Godzilla lead the opening charge?
He seems to be deciding where to attack.
The Kilaaks underground have still shown no reaction.
This force of giant monsters with Godzilla at its head is truly a sight to behold.
UFO approaching.
What?
It's King Ghidorah.
He's no Earth monster.
The Kilaaks summoned him.
We can't control him. 
What do we do?
We'll make Godzilla and the Earth monsters fight together.
King Ghidorah is a monster from space.
Earth's monsters are mo match for him.
Contact me whenever you're ready to talk.
Damn it.
It's King Ghidorah, the space monster.
He's taking aim at the Earth monsters from the air.
The monsters are ready.
King Ghidorah is swooping down savagely!
This is an amazing struggle!
Hear for yourselves the cries of these dreadful monsters!
A burning monster is fIying south toward Izu.
A burning monster?
I've never heard of such a thing!
Space creature or not, it can live while on fire?
It's heading straight for us!
Evacuate!
The Kilaaks are signaling us!
Fire Dragon destroyed
Dr. Yoshida's control system.
Won't further conflict simply result in more losses on your part?
What now? Do we attack?
Fire Dragon can reduce Tokyo to ashes in two to three hours.
Is that Godzilla?
It is. He's found the Kilaaks' underground stronghold.
The monsters are on the offensive.
They're still fighting, even without the control system.
They know by instinct who the true enemy is.
The KiIaaks didn't manage to see that coming!
Get away from here. G!
Thank goodness.
It's to soon to celebrate. Fire Dragon's coming back from the Bonin Islands.
We'll ambush him with the SY-3!
Katsuo!
Fire Dragon,
15 degrees ahead to port!
Prepare to fire freeze-ray missiles!
Fire!
We can't! The tracking system isn't working!
It's being jammed.
All right, use manual aim.
Yes, sir!
Let him fly past and stay on him!
Yes, sir!
Ready to fire!
Firing!
We've got to shake him!
Look!
A Kilaak flying saucer...
I get it!
Fire Dragon was just a machine!
We aren't being jammed amymore. Do we fire?
Yeah.
Fire!
We've done it!
Captain!
The End
Are you able to see anything at all, Burt?
Nothing, captain.
Only a surface of clouds.
This planet seems to be made of fog.
Not even infrared rays get through.
Well, keep trying.
I've got the laser on infrared, it may penetrate.
There, the strange signals are continuing.
Now the localization is sharper.
15 degrees, felcar coaxial alfa vacuum..
Right.
This is our sixth orbit around this planet, and that signal always comes from the same point.
If a man-made transmitter does exist, that's the spot, all right.
MARK: 2 more meteors.
Yes, sir. I'll check on the total.
Eldon, Tiona, Kell, we just rejected 2 more meteors.
What's our total now?
999, Wess.
1 more and I'll bake you a little birthday cake
with 1,000 candles.
Without this rejector,
we'd look like a piece of Swiss cheese.
Our ship would be down in less than a minute.
Let's prepare for a landing, Brad.
Okay.
Attention. Attention, all crew members, prepare for landing.
In 60 fractions of megon, we'll start the landing maneuver.
The intensity of the gravitational field
will be maintained
at the wave moment of force G 7.
Synchronize the meteor rejector
on the electro-magnetic control device.
Apply neuro-vascular tension.
Suppress cortical areas X, Y, Z.
Insert the automatic controls.
We will keep a distance of 2 parsecs
from our sister ship Galliot.
Respond when command received.
Command received.
Sanya, get me the captain of the other ship.
Spaceship Argos calling spaceship Galliot.
Spaceship Galliot, we're receiving.
Captain Salas is wanted on the ionoscope, please.
All right, mark, he's standing by.
You were right, mark.
It's not cosmic radiation.
It's a reality,
a reality that we'll see at first hand.
Glad to hear you admit it,
Salas. It's never too late.
We were never as crazy as you seemed to think.
You certainly had us worried, though.
Oh, you've put a spy on board? Huh, huh.
Anyway, you'll have to agree it was just luck.
You can't chase after all the sounds in the universe.
All right, so it's not a cosmic cloud.
But what about life?
Who can say yet that there's any life on aura?
Who can assure us that it's not a natural source of emission?
We'll find out soon enough.
Right now, get ready to land.
Synchronize on gravitational wave moment of force G 7.
Shall I put us on the automatic control?
Yes. When you're
2 parsecs from us.
1 minute.
Mark, wait.
Your younger brother is here
and he has something else to tell you.
Mark, I want to warn you.
This will be the first and only trip...
We've lost it.
Sanya, the reserve channel.
Zinex impulse, quickly.
Hello. Hello, Galliot.
Hello, Galliot?
Hello! Contact's been broken, mark.
The zinex impulse channel, throw it on.
The signal's been interrupted, mark.
The planet stopped transmitting.
SANYA: Galliot.
Sanya, what about the Galliot?
SANYA: Galliot, hello!
I'm not getting anything, mark.
The zinex impulse channel, try it again.
Hello, hello. Hello!
There's nothing, mark.
The radio communications are blocked.
Try it again,
Sanya.
Hello.
Hello, Galliot!
MARK: The automatic alarm.
MARK:
Emergency! Emergency!
The gravitational force is increasing rapidly.
Wess, where are we at?
Give me a reading.
20, mark. 20 G.
Seal bulkheads. Got to activate them now.
Brad, the automatic control, disengage it.
I'm switching to manual.
What happened? Why did she attack you? Is she crazy?
What happened?
Don't you remember?
Wess!
BURT:
Mark. Try to get hold of him.
Mark!
Are you out of your minds?
What's wrong with everyone?
Where are you going? Mark!
MARK: Tiona.
Tiona!
WESS: Stop!
DR. Karan! Stop!
Carter. Carter!
Mark, what was
I trying to do?
Mark...
WESS:
In here, Mark!
Mark, now Karan's gone crazy.
I was just coming to when he attacked Brad.
I rushed him, but he escaped through there.
Burt, you stay here.
Wess, come with me.
He's activated the security lock.
There's nothing we can do.
They open only when the sensors touch the ground.
The helmets! We'd better get the helmets.
What happened? How did
I get out of the ship?
What are you looking at me like that for?
We don't know what happened, Karan.
Only some of us have been behaving strangely with no memory of it afterward.
Do you feel all right now?
I guess so.
You're sure?
Yes, yes,
I'm sure.
All right, go inside.
Some of the men seem to be hurt, doctor.
I want you to take a look at them.
He doesn't remember anything either.
What's happened?
What's going on?
I wish I knew.
MARK:
I can't see anything.
Not a sign of the Galliot.
Yet we don't seem to be damaged at all.
Come on, let's get in the ship.
I can't see a scratch on the radar guidance arms.
Let's check the underside.
There's no damage.
It's as if we made a practice landing at the space academy.
Come on let's get in.
All right, all right.
Quiet down. Quiet down.
Stay calm.
Let's all try to stay calm and figure out what happened.
Now, the automatic controls went completely haywire.
Maybe we can find out why after Wess has had a chance to check over his recordings.
Without warning, the force of gravity increased like mad.
And it went up to 40 G.
A force which only a planet with a mass 1,000 times superior to ours could've put out.
That's not all.
While you were all unconscious and I was expecting the ship to crash head-on, the force suddenly stopped and we set down gently.
And then...
You all went crazy.
BRAD:
And if you hadn't held out,
I hate to think of what would've happened.
Yes, it is pretty puzzling.
What do you think, professor Karan?
I don't know. I don't know what to think.
I've always known that any force greater than 25 G's kills every living thing in a few seconds.
Urgent. Urgent.
Emergency!
Be quiet.
Emergency!
Conditions desperate.
Little chance of survival. Help us.
We can't hold out much longer.
Repeat.
Conditions desperate.
Sounds like capt. Salas.
They must be in trouble.
Sanya, keep trying.
Burt, take a look on the infra-ray, see if you can spot anything.
They must be fairly close.
Urgent. Urgent.
Help us.
Hello. Hello. Argos calling Galliot.
Argos calling
Galliot.
We're receiving you.
Continue on this frequency.
We'll try to get a fix on you.
What is your position?
Argos calling Galliot.
Argos calling Galliot!
Mark, look!
What have you got?
The Galliot.
MARK: The red's cut through.
Can't tell how far it is.
Get me a fix on this right now.
We'll do a low-altitude takeoff and search.
They can't be too far away.
Wess, Brad, control.
All our solar batteries have been short-circuited.
Any visible reason?
Another mystery?
Wess, what can we do about it?
I checked the temperature.
Second lavic stage.
I'm not interested in the temperature.
Can we get across it or not?
Well, it's pretty dangerous down there.
The rocks appear to be fused and they're solid enough.
If they continue across the marsh, and if we're lucky...
Let's try it.
Clear.
It's obvious.
They fought.
They fought and killed each other off.
Just as we were about to do.
None of this... this madness that has touched some of us, none of this is coincidence.
This was planned.
By whom?
By what?
And what about the others?
We can look for them.
Poor Toby, on his first trip...
The chamber's locked from the inside.
We'll need a torch to break through.
I counted 4, what about the others?
They don't seem to be inside.
Let's take a look around.
WESS: There isn't anybody in the upper chambers.
MARK: And what about the control room?
It's empty.
Look in the dome's secondary corridors.
All right.
In the meantime, we'll look in the sections of the automatic circuits.
Now, in case of any emergency, we meet in the atomic generator room.
MARK:
Find anything?
WESS: No. The energy section is deserted.
Let's continue.
The 3 that are missing can't disappear into thin air.
Shh.
Listen.
It's coming from the generator room.
Turrell.
And Salas, mark?
The meteor rejector is out of commission.
It can't be repaired, either.
The Galliot won't fly again.
Neither will her crew.
What about this bulkhead?
We've got to get through.
I'll take care of it, mark.
I'll get the cutting torch from the Argos.
No, you'd never make it alone.
No. We'll bury Derek and the others and then we'll leave you on guard, Eldon.
We'll go for the cutting torch and I promise you, we'll get back just as fast as we can.
Sanya, I know how you feel, but don't go to pieces now.
Just be thankful we were spared.
Come on. We've got to keep moving.
We'll get back as fast as we can, Eldon.
Keep a sharp watch.
MALE VOICE:
Eldon...
Eldon...
Eldon...
Eldon...
MARK: Eldon?
Eldon, where are you?
Eldon, where are you?
Eldon?
Eldon!
Maybe he's inside the ship.
Tiona, you stay here.
If anything moves, shoot first, ask questions later.
MARK: It's weird.
There's no one here.
WESS: But we left
4 bodies here.
How could they have disappeared?
Eldon?
Eldon!
Kir! Salas!
Where are they?
They're gone.
All of them.
Eldon, too. I left him on guard.
Listen, mark, maybe you imagined it.
Maybe the bodies really weren't in here, you just thought you saw them. Hallucination.
I don't suffer from hallucinations, Karan.
I saw the bodies.
Maybe our senses react in a strange way on this planet.
I saw the bodies.
I saw my brother, dead.
What happened to Eldon, then?
He wasn't a ghost, a hallucination.
Let's take it easy.
There must be some logical explanation.
KARAN:
That's right, Mark.
Mark.
What is it, Wess?
We weren't dreaming.
Those bodies really existed.
Look, blood!
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
What happened?
Tiona, what did you see? Tell us.
Come on, let's get out of here. Hurry!
There seems to be several things completely unexplainable.
For 2 years, we heard the electronic signals coming from this planet.
Now that we're here, nothing.
Yes, but we did hear voices.
A strange tongue, but voices.
There were intelligent beings here.
You could've fooled me.
I never felt so all alone.
Maybe we're not alone.
Somebody or something could be watching us here, right now.
If there are any intelligent creatures on this planet, they're our enemies.
Wess, you've been taking sightings and adding figures, what does it come out to?
How long can we stay here?
3 days, mark.
Another 3 days before this planet's orbit will have swept us so far away, we may not get back home at all.
What do you think?
Can you boost the solar batteries by then?
I'm trying to hook up some other way of starting us.
What are our chances?
We have 3 chances in 10 to make it, or be blown to smithereens.
All right, Wess, tomorrow morning, you get to work.
Take whoever you need to help you.
Right now, I think we should all get some sleep.
I think we need it.
A captain should not be afraid.
And I confess now, to whoever may hear this, that today, now,
I am experiencing fear.
I must not let my crew know this,
I must keep them busy.
I must not let them know that the situation appears more hopeless with each passing day.
Dictated by capt. Mark markary, of the spaceship Argos on the planet aura...
Wess!
Wess!
More trouble?
He was trying to disconnect the meteor rejector.
Disconnect the meteor rejector?
I don't understand.
I assure you, I don't understand it either.
Wess, you knew what you were doing.
Yes, I knew.
I was fully aware, all the time.
What?
I couldn't help myself.
I fought it with all my power.
But, it was no use.
I had to disconnect the meteor rejector.
But why,
Wess, why?
I don't know!
It was like...
Like another will fighting my own, in my mind.
Trying to take over control.
Dr. Karan, have you got any thoughts on this?
The only conclusion
I can make is that each one of us is his own worst enemy.
But how?
Why?
I'm afraid
I know.
Whatever unseen beings are out there, they apparently have the power to influence our minds when we're unconscious.
They tried it during the landing and just now when we were sleeping.
If what you say is true, Karan, we mustn't give them any more chances.
From now on, we'll put a guard on anyone who's sleeping.
Who's there?
Burt!
Burt!
What's up?
I... I don't know. I thought
I heard something.
Did you see anything?
I don't know what I saw.
I don't even know if
I saw anything at all.
Mark said to sing out if we saw anything not in the book.
If we saw any thing at all.
I'm going to report.
Emergency. Guard post 3.
Emergency.
Wess, you come with me.
The rest of you, be careful.
What is it?
I thought I saw something.
What?
Out there.
Well, like luminous globes.
I saw them out of the corner of my eye.
But when I looked, they were gone.
Where's Burt?
He's gone back to post number 2.
Keep your eyes open, but don't get carried away.
Who's out there?
Hold it!
Burt, what happened?
Tell me, who did it?
It was... Captain, captain Salas.
What's out there, mark?
What's happening?
That's what we have to find out before they kill us all.
Come on, let's get him into the ship. Give me a hand.
1 entire crew lost and 2 of our own crewmen gone.
Burt dead,
Eldon disappeared.
And this unknown enemy keeps getting closer.
KARAN: The enemy is also becoming visible.
What do you mean by that?
Well, you saw something.
Something not quite identifiable, out of the corner of your eye.
As if it were composed of little globes of light, something fleeting, nothing definite.
The minute I looked at the things directly, they were gone.
SANYA: How can you explain it?
MARK:
I don't know.
It's possible they're an alien form of life.
DR. KARAN: That's true. Their form here could be based on a different plane of vibrations.
Flesh-and-blood men can't see them, except obliquely, as you did, mark.
WESS: Those strange wails we heard could be their voices.
That's right.
Well, we'll bury
Burt tomorrow.
Another tomb we have to leave on this dangerous planet.
Sanya?
I'll be right with you, mark.
First, I want to remove
Burt's nameplate.
Sanya.
Sanya, come on.
They need you.
Oh, I still have
Burt's nameplate.
Give it to me.
I'll finish the records.
You've done enough today.
Thank you.
Aah!
Rest well, Burt.
I'm sorry we weren't around to help you.
I promise we'll try to see that you didn't die in vain.
All right, let's not stand around, we've got work to do.
Feeling better,
Tiona?
Better, mark.
I swear it, mark.
I didn't imagine it.
Wess?
I think we'll make it, mark.
I'm beginning to get energy traces across the inductors.
How much longer?
We might be ready by tonight.
Good. We're making a little tour of inspection.
Carter says he saw something in the valley, something shining.
Let's go take a look.
CARTER: Mark!
Come here.
Look down there.
That's what
I saw shining.
MARK:
Finally, something tangible.
That doesn't disappear when I look straight at it.
SANYA: Looks like it's been here for a long time.
Look how pitted and scarred the hull is.
MARK: Doesn't look like any ship I've ever seen.
SANYA: Do you think it belongs to the Aureans?
CARTER: I doubt they ever built any spaceships.
If they had, we would've...
Look, Mark.
MARK: It's 3 times the size of us, and judging by the deterioration of the calcium, it must've been here a long time.
Probably belonged to an ancient civilization.
Carter, you stay here.
Keep your eyes and ears open.
Right.
Sanya and I will take a look around inside this thing.
Oh, uh, if he moves, just call out.
Right.
(HIGH-PITCHED BUZZING,
SANYA GASPS)
Sanya, what is it?
Oh, I...
I got a shock.
How?
Touching that.
Ouch!
That must be over 200 volts.
I wonder what they used it for.
Possibly it's an electric torch. They...
Held it in their hands and it became luminous.
Beings as big as they seem to have been could have held it without feeling any kind of shock.
Carter.
Carter!
Carter!
Carter!
Car... Ter!
Mark, look what I found.
What is it?
Looks like a tuning fork.
Why didn't we think of that before?
Of what?
The locking device could be a Sonic one, a lock designed to open only to a certain sound, to a certain frequency only.
Mark, it's strange in here. I can't breathe.
Something's drawing the air out through this vent.
We've got to find a way to get out of here.
If only we could find the secret of that lock.
Ooh!
Quick, get out!
Carter!
Carter, where are you?
Maybe he's gone back to the Argos for help.
Yes, you could be right. Come on.
Let's go.
Let's get back.
Carter?
Yes.
No, mark. He's not with us.
He was with you, wasn't he?
Has he disappeared as well?
I'll tell you what happened later.
Mark?
Tiona, she's in shock.
What happened?
She was standing guard and all of a sudden
I heard her scream.
When I reached her, she could only point and whisper,
"Danny, Toby."
There was nothing, mark.
Absolutely nothing.
She simply broke down.
We'd better talk to her.
I saw them, aah.
I saw them, aah...
I saw them.
I looked right at them.
Who did you see,
Tiona? Who?
They were there, in the fog.
All mutilated and bloody.
Who, Tiona, who?
Tell me.
I looked right at them.
They didn't go away.
They were humans, not ghosts.
Who, Tiona, who? Tell me, who did you see, Tiona?
Empty faces.
Dead faces.
Post number 1.
Post number 1.
Reply to call.
Post number 2, post number 2.
Post number 2.
Call received. All ok.
Here's post number 3.
Post number 3.
Post number 3.
Everything fine here too.
I'm passing back to number 1.
Machinery room.
Machinery room.
This is post number 1. Wess?
I'm anxious to know how you're doing.
Standing guard here makes one
even more impatient for the blast-off.
Is there much more to do
before the batteries will be ready? Well?
I understand.
You're worried.
But I don't think it'll be too much longer.
We're practically there, mark.
Another 8 circuits to go and then...
And then we either take off or we...
Or we blow up.
Right now, I'd welcome either one.
Post number 3 alarm!
Who's there?
Who's out there?
No! Don't fire.
Salas.
Kir.
Yes, mark.
It's us.
It's us.
We're so exhausted it's hard to concentrate.
We remember descending for a landing with all conditions perfect.
Then nothing.
Until we found ourselves fighting our way out of unconsciousness somewhere out there.
Well?
That's about it, mark.
Go on.
We walked around some, looking for the Galliot.
But we didn't find her.
It was a miracle that you found us.
All right. I'm glad you made it. I sure can use you.
Now, go and get some sleep.
Thanks, mark.
I forgot. If one of you sleeps, the other must stand guard.
That's an order.
I'll explain it later.
Very well, mark.
What do you make of it?
I don't know what to think, mark.
Shock? Temporary or partial amnesia?
By now, nothing should surprise us.
Anyway, you can't argue with the fact that they're here.
And very much alive.
Or so it seems.
TIONA:
Mark.
You said "seems", mark.
How many strange things seem and then are ever since we got on this planet?
I really saw them, the 3 we buried yesterday.
I know they're dead.
And I saw another one, mark.
Who, Tiona?
Burt.
Burt?
Even though we buried him yesterday.
I saw him, mark. I saw him.
I saw him, mark!
If only I could be certain of what you're saying.
There's a way to be certain.
You see?
It's intact.
TIONA:
Open it. Mark.
Ah!
Wess!
Dr. Karan!
Salas and Kir are not in their bunks.
Have you seen them?
No.
Have you?
Salas!
Salas!
Salas!
No, it's not Salas.
Just his body.
I inhabit the body of your late captain.
And I'm just one of many beings on this planet.
Many beings who are desperate.
We've been in trouble many years now, and we're fighting to survive.
We arranged for several of you to kill each other so that we could take over your bodies.
You are our last chance.
It's imperative that our race continue to exist.
At our expense?
If you were in our place, you would understand.
On your planet,
I know you humans have fought and killed for centuries.
Do you really expect us to be any different?
We cannot be wiped out.
We'll stop at nothing.
We must fight, no matter how.
We are a race that exists on a vibratory plane different from yours.
Our limitations are entirely different.
Our technology, we cannot build anything, spaceships like this.
We need ships to get away.
Perhaps our survival is possible somewhere else.
Our sun's been dying, as you can see.
And that means the end of our species as well.
We have been attempting to summon you here for centuries.
Just as our sun had no more energy, you heard our message.
We never expected you to actually respond.
You mean, it was nothing but a lure.
You wanted us here.
That's why you sent that message.
Have you tried this trick before?
Yes.
The strange ship from another system.
And I suppose you need our dead bodies?
No. They must be willing only to submit.
Lose their bodies as well as lose their will.
We'll never submit to a breed of parasites.
Our relationship would be symbiotic.
In effect, we would be 1 body.
It would in no sense be parasitical.
You've got no choice.
Either all of us go back together or none of you, nobody will go back.
You will never get there.
You'll see. We will get there, mark.
A certain rejector, vital to you, has been taken away.
You can't leave without it.
We'll return it to you, only if you agree to take us back with you.
All right, you've heard all of the facts.
And you'll cooperate.
No, never.
We'll give up our lives to save our own race.
Quick, the generator room!
Wess, you have the red key to the atomic detonators.
Here's the green one.
I want 3 pounds of plutonium.
What are you going to do, mark?
The Galliot's going to be blown up with its entire cargo of living dead.
But first, I've got to get back the meteor rejector.
Wess, how long will it take you to get ready?
I have to finish the photonic ignition.
The rest is all set.
Good. I want you to stay here.
You 2 come with me.
Wess, as soon as we're out, close the doors and the bulkheads, but keep the screens turned on.
As soon as you see us coming back, turn on the ignition.
We'll worry about replacing the rejector after we're out in space.
That's taking a terrible risk.
Yes. I wish it were the only risk we'd have to run before taking off.
But there's no other solution.
Go on, get the detonators.
Tiona, you stay here.
Cover our retreat.
Don't move for any reason.
And remember, the danger is not only in front of you.
15 seconds after the Galliot explodes, if we haven't come back, you run to the Argos and take off, understand?
Mark, I can't let... that's an order, Karan.
Let's go.
There's nobody here.
Now, I want you 2 to stay right here.
No, mark. You won't go alone.
Listen, Brad, I'm not trying to be a hero.
We each have
1 charge.
If I don't make it, it'll be your turn.
If he fails, you try it next.
You stay here,
Brad. Cover us.
My brother.
He's turned into 1 of them.
Take the count.
Ready? Now.
Go ahead.
Quick, in the generator room.
Sanya, give me the countdown.
TOBY:
All right, you can stop now. throw away your gun.
Leave the meteor rejector.
You'd better get used to the idea, mark.
You've reached the end.
You have lost.
Toby, if you have anything left in you of what you were, let me go on.
Fortunately, there's nothing of what I was left.
Only the body's the same and now...
No use, mark. You can't harm me with violence.
Sorry, Toby, but this is the only way I can prevent you from stopping me.
Ah!
Time's running out. Hurry.
Ah!
Ah!
There they are.
They're being followed.
We'd better help them.
Karan, Brad, Tiona:
Dead.
Dead?
I'd better replace the meteor rejector right away.
Sanya, you take the controls until we come back.
It's sad, mark.
Out of 18 people, there are only 3 of us left.
I'm ashamed to be alive.
They died to save our planet.
Can you imagine?
Our world invaded by those horrible creatures?
Just thinking about it, seems a nightmare.
Mark.
Yes, it is sad, Wess.
But it was only luck that brought us here.
Wess, you need some sleep.
You haven't slept for 2 nights.
Yes.
Sanya and I will keep watch.
I need some sleep.
Who's there?
Mark, is it you?
Sanya?
If I wasn't so wide awake,
I'd swear I was dreaming.
What happened, Wess?
I was about to fall asleep, when I heard footsteps out in the passageway.
They approached my cabin.
Then what happened?
Then, the door opened, slowly.
As if someone were debating whether or not to come in.
And did they?
No, Sanya.
Then you didn't see anything.
Yes, I did.
He was holding his field ray gun.
He was mirrored on the metal wall.
Are you sure you saw him?
I know you won't believe me, Sanya.
I certainly wish I was wrong, myself.
But it was really him. Mark!
It was mark, Sanya.
Why did he come to me so...
Furtively?
Maybe he wanted to kill me.
Well, then what are your conclusions, Wess?
Unfortunately, there's only 1 conclusion.
Even mark is controlled by one of them.
Oh, it's impossible.
Let's go see.
Wess?
Wait a minute.
Mark.
Wess has found out about us.
Don't be afraid, Wess.
Nobody wants to harm you.
Nobody wants to kill you.
You...
You're one of them.
And you too, Sanya.
It's horrible.
You.
Both of you.
You must become one of us.
All you have to do is want it.
Just let one of us join you.
It'll give you this wonderful new complexity.
No. No!
Our world will never fall into your hands!
Maybe not, but you won't be the one to stop us.
Yes, I will!
Ah!
Sanya, without the meteor rejector, we'll never be able to reach home.
What do we do?
We'll have to land now, on that planet.
I've done an analysis with a special probe.
We can exist in the atmosphere.
It's the third planet of the star we call sol.
It's so small, it's not even marked on the astro-navigation charts.
But will it be possible to live there, for us and those who follow us?
It's most likely a young, primitive world.
But I think it'll be all right for us.
SANYA: I'll activate the long-range telescopic lens.
Yes, I was right.
It is a puny civilization.
Their buildings are still made of stone and iron.
How will they accept us?
I hope, well.
For them.
THE ARTIST JOHAN BORG
DISAPPEARED SOME YEARS AGO
WITHOUT A TRACE, FROM HIS HOME
ON THE ISLAND OF BALTRUM
IN THE FRISIAN ISLANDS.
HIS WIFE ALMA
LATER LEFT ME JOHAN'S DIARY,
WHICH SHE HAD FOUND
AMONG HIS PAPERS.
THIS DIARY AND ALMA'S ACCOUNT
ARE THE BASIS OF THIS FILM.
Can someone move that chair?
And lower that a little...
HOUR OF THE WOLF
A FILM BY
INGMAR BERGMAN
Have you been...
Listen, we're not quite finished yet.
No? All right.
Quiet, all!
Rolling!
Take!
Camera!
And begin.
No...
I have nothing more to tell.
I've given you the diary.
And you wonder why
I choose to stay on here?
We've lived in this house together almost seven years.
Come winter,
I can move to the mainland, work at the store as I have done before when money was short.
The baby is due in a month, the doctor has said.
He examined me in May, before the very last time we came out here.
It was on a Friday, I remember.
It was quite late... about 10:00, I think.
But it was still light out.
We'd planned to stay here until August.
We were going to be completely alone.
He didn't want to see another human being here.
He was afraid.
He liked that I was quiet.
He liked...
We got here at about 3:00 in the morning.
We found a wheelbarrow in a shed on the beach.
When we got here, we were happy to see the apple tree in blossom.
Then we discovered footprints under the kitchen window in the flower bed.
It annoyed Johan, but we forgot about it, because...
Yes, we were happy.
We were happy to be home in our own house again.
Johan was uneasy.
He always grew anxious when his work did not go well, and it had not gone well for some time now.
And he became sleepless.
He was frightened, as if he was afraid of the dark.
It had gotten worse in the last few years.
- I know what.
- What?
- I'm going to draw you.
- No!
- Yes!
- Oh, no.
- Please let me!
- No.
- Yes, if you sit over there.
- No.
Oh, come on now.
Go on, Fatso!
- Here?
- A little farther back... there.
- Are you cold?
- No.
I knew that.
So sit, just sit like you always do.
Don't straighten up.
And pull the coat down a little over your shoulder... just like that, and pull your hair up so I can see your neck better.
Fine, that's right.
And where are my glasses?
And the damned bow is broken again.
There, can you sit just like that a moment?
If day after day,
I patiently drew you...
Hello!
Now, look...
I haven't shown these to anyone.
You see,
I made sketches of them!
This is the one who turns up most often.
And he's almost harmless.
I think he's homosexual.
And then there's the old lady, the one always threatening to take off her hat.
Do you know what happens if she does?
Her face comes off along with it, you see.
And here...
He's the worst of the lot.
I call him the Bird Man.
I don't know if it's a real beak or only a mask.
He's so strangely quick... and he's related to Papageno of The Magic Flute.
And the others!
The meat-eaters, the insects... and especially the spider men.
Here, the schoolmaster, his pointer in his trousers.
And then all the cast-iron, cackling women.
You must stay awake a little while longer.
In just an hour or so it will be dawn... and then I can sleep.
A minute is actually an immense space of time.
Wait, here it starts.
Ten seconds.
These seconds...
You see how long they last?
The minute isn't over yet!
Ah, finally.
It's gone now.
Say something.
Talk to me, Alma.
Hey, you... there's something
I've thought about for a long time.
Are you listening?
We've lived together for seven years now...
No, that's not what I was going to say.
Now I know.
Isn't it true that old people who have lived a lifetime together start to resemble each other?
They finally share so much, their thoughts and their faces take on the same expression.
Why do you think that is?
I hope we will get so old that we... think each other's thoughts... and we get little, dried-up, identical wrinkled faces.
What do you think about that?
Are you sleeping?
Come now.
Let's go to bed now.
Okay.
Don't look so frightened, child.
I'm not dangerous.
Give me your hand.
Well?
Can you feel my hand now?
My fingers, the veins under my skin?
At my age, the hands can get a little cold.
I am, after all, 216 years old.
No, what am I saying?
Seventy-six, I mean.
No, I had better be on my way now.
Now, what was it
I was going to say?
Now I remember.
In his black satchel under the bed, there's the sketchbook with drawings...
Tell him not to do that.
And then one more thing.
He hides his diary in the same satchel.
Read it!
No, no!
DIARY
Wednesday, July 22nd.
I have recently been ill.
Not seriously, but unpleasant enough.
Pardon the interruption, but I have pondered for days how most appropriately
I might approach you.
I deemed it most polite to get directly to the point.
My name is Von Merkens,
Baron Von Merkens.
Borg.
As you may know,
I own this island.
I live in the old castle on the north side.
Would you and your wife care to join us for a simple family supper?
That's kind of you.
It will be very simple, but I'll give you a good wine.
And our salmon fishing is renowned.
Good-bye.
I should also say that my wife and I are among your admirers, your... fondest admirers.
Thursday, July 27th.
A very warm, hazy day.
I am still sickly after my illness.
Do you see this mark?
Be more careful, my love, or it will end in disaster.
Don't you remember?
I was leaving for a party, and I was wearing my green brocade dress.
Afterwards, I had such trouble putting my hair up again!
And then I forgot my gloves.
I have something
I must speak to you about.
I've received a letter that I must show you.
It was sent yesterday.
And here is what it says...
"You do not see us, but we see you.
"The most horrible things can happen.
"Dreams can become unveiled.
The end is near..."
"The wells will run dry,
"and other fluids will moisten your white loins.
Thus is it decided."
I almost became ill reading it.
How hot your hands are.
Do you have a fever?
Before I see you,
I always get so wound up.
Can you understand that?
I wander as if in a dream the whole afternoon.
All my chores become so unreal and meaningless.
Be so kind as to help me with the zipper in my dress.
It always gets caught.
A strong wind indeed!
But magnificent, is it not?
This place must be a painter's dream or what?
I've lived here for quite a while.
One returns to the scene of the crime, so to speak, and commits new crimes!
You appear to be tired.
Don't over-exert yourself.
I mean, at our age, a certain caution is to be advised.
Youth is of tougher mettle.
I happen to know.
My name is Heerbrand, psychiatric curator.
I finger people's souls and turn their insides out.
What do we see then?
I hardly need to tell you.
As an artist, you know the human heart.
What don't you see in your facial studies, not to mention in your self-portraits?
Why do you look at me like that?
Did I anger you?
Your nerves out of sorts?
Something plaguing you?
Shut up!
Shut up!
I think I need to ask you for more money.
What you gave me this month is almost gone.
We must pay the store next time we go to the mainland.
The bill is 176.50, and then there's the milk.
Don't just shovel over money like that.
You have to look at my accounting!
It's quite important, at least to me.
I received 500 on the 3rd.
You bought me that blanket, rather expensive... 35.
But it's warm and lovely when I lie alone.
And here's the previous bill from the store.
It's high because we had to buy flour, sugar, and canned goods.
Comes to over 200 kronor... 219.
And there's pocket money and stamps and a chain for my bicycle and new radio batteries... and the potato peeler... then soap, washing powder, a nail brush.
You need a new toothbrush.
The one you have looks horrible.
- No.
- Well, it does.
Then 50 kronor for your boy's birthday.
And postage... 75 öre.
That's about 500 kronor.
You can count it to be sure.
We're invited to the castle on Friday.
I know.
How do you know that?
Good evening.
My wife Corinne.
You're very welcome.
Welcome.
My mother Countess Von Merkens.
My brother Ernst.
A pleasure.
A pleasure.
Here is Archivist Lindhorst.
Delighted. I am one of your fondest admirers.
And this is Curator Heerbrand.
A pleasure.
I believe we've met already.
Would you like a drink?
- May I serve a little...
- Yes, by all means.
The summer heat makes you so thirsty.
So how long have you been there?
I thought you had been living here for months, we've been hearing about you for so long!
Time flies so quickly!
Delighted you could come.
Damned awful housemaid.
But she's cheap, of course.
My brother cannot afford better.
I would like you all to observe that the reason the soup...
We live in one place now.
We used to travel a lot.
Do you enjoy travel?
Nothing is as stimulating.
Alma is an unusual and beautiful name.
I'm completely incapable of feeling aggression.
I can muster bureaucratic vengefulness...
Here, we're used to humiliation.
We find it pleasurable... our fangs have remained intact.
Nowadays I want to be loved.
I once bought a painting from a well-known artist.
No comments now, Ernst!
Then I hung it upside down in my salon and invited the artist over, along with a lot of people who appreciated a good joke!
What a laugh we had then!
My God, how we laughed.
What do you say, sir Artist?
Wasn't that a fine joke?
The sores never heal, the pus never ceases to flow.
The infection is constant... worse, faster, or slower towards the end.
The resistance of the heart decides the outcome.
I am constantly losing weight.
I travel the world over consulting specialists.
Sometimes the loss just stops, as it did this summer, but then it starts again.
My husband says it's psychological, that it all began when we lost our money.
I embezzled the family fortune!
- I am the guilty one!
- We've heard this...
Why is Lindhorst sitting at our table?
Can't we just sell and leave?
My fault, my fault, all this suffering.
My fault!
And then I shouted,
"To hell with your medicines!
"It won't go away.
It will never go away!
"You must operate it away.
You must just slice it off!
I am an old hag.
There must be a limit!"
And then he laughed and said,
"No, madame Countess,
I have never heard of any limits at all!"
Yes, we have children, two boys.
Oh, no, not here.
They live with an uncle... whom I believe is an acquaintance?
I understand you know
Veronica Vogler.
And very well, after what I've heard.
An extraordinarily beautiful woman.
Veronica Vogler is charming!
Have you also met her?
Truly very charming.
No?
Such hatred in those eyes!
Fredrik, the cacti you planted need to go!
I mean, I don't enjoy them at all.
Actually, I am allergic to them.
You shouldn't drag them along...
All right, then! We shall take coffee in the library.
- Help me a little.
- Yes...
Ladies and gentlemen!
Your attention!
May I offer a small puppet show to divert us?
Can we extinguish the lights?
There. Good.
Our guests of honor.
Come, come.
There.
Music.
The Magic Flute is the greatest example.
One moment.
I shall prove this presently.
Tamino's guides have just left him in the dark courtyard outside the Temple of Wisdom.
The young man cries in deepest despair,
"Oh, eternal night, when shalt thou pass?
When shall the light find my eyes?"
The fatally ill Mozart secretly empathizes with these words.
And the reply from the chorus and orchestra is also,
"Soon, soon, youth..."
"or never."
The most beautiful, the most shattering music ever written.
Tamino asks,
"Is Pamina still alive?"
The invisible chorus answers,
"Pamina, Pamina is still alive."
Hear... the strange and illogical but genial rhythm...
Pami... Na.
This is no longer the name of a young woman... but an incantation, a sorcerer's formula.
A name text...
In short, a commission... and yet the highest manifestation of art.
Would you not agree, sir Artist?
Pardon me.
I call myself "artist" for want of a better term.
There is nothing self-evident in my creative work except the compulsion to do it.
Through no intent of my own,
I have been pointed out as something apart, a five-legged calf, a monster.
I have never fought for that position, nor do I do so now to keep it.
Yet I may well at times have felt the winds of megalomania sweep across my brow.
But I believe myself to be immune.
I need only for one second remind myself of the utter unimportance of art in the human world in order to cool myself down again.
But that does not mean the compulsion does not remain.
- So speaks a true artist!
- This is a real confession.
Magnificent!
What courage! What clarity!
I suggest we raise our glasses to our artist...
Not only a genius but a thinker, too!
I'll be damned.
I never would have suspected.
A flowering rose for your hair.
I must have scratched your cheek with my fingernail.
Let me see.
I think it's bleeding!
My handkerchief...
No, it is clean.
- Our artist is wounded.
- I'm so clumsy.
Stay calm now.
You've had too much to drink.
Come, stay by me for a little while now.
He doesn't sleep at night.
That's why he can handle so little.
Come, let's you and I get some fresh air.
The core of the castle dates from the 14th century.
It's been in our family since the late 16th century.
We got a little over-excited.
We live in such isolation.
We gave you a scare, but you won't leave us now, will you?
See there, Corinne, our castle is rather beautiful at night.
Yes, and that would be only at night.
My garter!
Look away now, Mr. Heerbrand!
- Where has Ernst gone?
- Ernst, friend, where are you?
I just went off on my own a bit.
I'm ashamed that the grounds are so unkempt.
Imagine ten years ago...
A paragon of garden art.
We never kiss.
Have you thought of that?
I can almost count our kisses.
There is something that frightens me almost to insanity.
I meet an unknown man in the road.
We converse.
Suddenly he turns and lands a vicious blow on my cheek!
His face is corpse white and his eyes are full of hatred.
And I understand nothing!
I only feel nauseated.
My nose is bleeding,
I stammer some silly excuses, horribly shaken, and I ask myself, when the man has disappeared,
"Is this how it is?
Is this how it must be?"
I can never forget the man's eyes.
- The worst thing was...
- Nothing to worry about.
The blow, that blow...
The worst of all was the man's eyes...
Are you leaving already?
No, before you leave you must see where I've hung your painting of Veronica Vogler.
Alma, dear, come along, too.
She's sleeping.
We won't disturb her.
- I'm not sleeping.
- Of course we'll go along.
Come, then, both of you.
Won't take a moment.
Alma, you are about to see something very beautiful your husband has made.
Here is the painting, directly in front of my bed.
I can see it each morning and night.
It has become like a part of my solitary life.
I love her.
How long did you live together?
Pardon my asking something so personal.
- Five years.
- Really?
So he's told you?
He loved her, didn't he?
I didn't need to ask that.
It was a first-class scandal at the time.
But so romantic...
- Jealous?
- I don't believe so.
My husband is quite jealous.
Well, he's an excellent lover.
Look at this mark, by the way.
It's a scar from another man's, shall we say, advances?
A never-ending spring of renewed desire.
It's all very trivial, of course, but it's stimulating for me.
I need to come up with something new soon.
That mark can't evoke fascinated admiration forever.
Can you help me?
Alma, little dear, don't get angry.
It was only in jest, of course, but it was a stupid joke.
Come, let's go down to the others.
I have, in any case, bought a considerable piece of your husband... have I not?
I have to confess that I have read your diary.
It makes me sick with fear!
Wait. Hear me out.
I need to tell you what I've been thinking these past few days.
Here's what I've been thinking.
I see that something is going to happen, something evil, but I don't know what to call it.
But if you think
I'm going to run away, I won't!
I won't run away no matter how frightened I am!
And one more thing.
They're trying to separate us.
They want you for themselves.
As long as I'm with you, it's much harder for them.
I won't run away, no matter how much they try!
I'll stay right where I am!
Johan, answer me!
- Do you hear how quiet it is?
- Yes, it is quiet.
There was a time when nights were for sleep... deep, dreamless sleep.
I cannot sleep.
I wake out of fear.
- Are you tired?
- No, not so terribly.
I have held vigil each night until daylight.
But this is the worst hour.
- Do you know what it's called?
- No.
The old people used to call it the "Hour of the Wolf."
It's the hour at which most people die and most children are born.
It's now that the nightmares come to us.
- And if we are awake...
- We are afraid.
We are afraid.
What is it?
Nothing. I just thought of something from my childhood.
It was some sort of punishment.
They threw me into a closet.
They shut the door.
It got quiet and dark.
I was horribly scared.
I kicked and pounded, because they had told me that a little person lived in that closet... who gnawed the toes off naughty children!
When I stopped pounding,
I heard something rattling, and I knew my hour had come.
And in a kind of... silent panic,
I climbed onto some shelves and tried to heave myself up by my hands.
Clothes tumbled around me.
I lost my grip and fell.
I swung my fists through the air to shield myself from that little creature.
All the while I wailed in fear and begged to be forgiven.
Finally the door opened and they let me step out into the daylight.
My father said,
"Mother tells me you're sorry."
I said,
"Yes, please forgive me."
"Prepare the divan, then," he said.
I went to the green divan in my father's room, took some cushions, and stacked them.
Then I fetched the cane, unbuttoned my trousers, and leaned forward onto the cushions.
He said, "So how many strokes do you deserve?"
And I answered,
"As many strokes as possible."
And he struck me with the cane, hard enough but not more than I could bear.
When the caning was over,
I went to Mother and asked,
"Mother, can you forgive me now?"
And she cried and said,
"Of course I forgive you."
Then she offered me her hand.
I kissed it.
Alma, are you listening?
Are you asleep?
No, I'm awake.
My back aches.
To think it's pitch black out still.
And so quiet...
Strange, how the sea is never still.
Frightening somehow.
- Are you crying?
- No, I'm not crying.
I'm thinking of the child and this great, quiet darkness.
Maybe it will never get light again.
Poor dear.
Give me your hand.
That's much better.
Remember that day
I said I'd been snake bitten?
Yes.
It wasn't a snakebite.
Not a snakebite?
I thought I'd never tell a soul.
I don't even know if...
You have to tell me!
You must never tell anyone else.
No, I promise,
I'll never tell anyone.
Remember that place by the cliffs?
We were there early this summer.
Yes.
Is the door locked securely?
I checked twice.
Good morning!
Forgive my intrusion.
A thousand pardons.
Looks like a storm coming!
I thought I'd stop in for a moment.
I do also have an errand.
May I sit down?
This won't take long.
I am to convey an invitation from the castle.
We had thought a little party...
No, not a big gathering.
Just something to distract those poor people stuck in the castle year round, gnawing on each other!
As I said, not a large party.
But it will interest you that Veronica Vogler will be there.
And you will come too, yes?
All right, then it's agreed.
Incidentally, Von Merkens and I discussed the other day your possible need to defend yourself.
I mean, from all the small game on the island.
That is all for the moment.
Good morning, dear friends.
Hope to see you at our little party.
Shouldn't you lock that weapon away?
No, why?
And what do we do now?
You can tell me about Veronica Vogler.
What do you want me to say?
That it went on for five years?
You know that already.
We were discovered.
It was a huge scandal.
The story was quieted down... and then it ended.
That's not what it says in your diary.
"My attachment to Veronica finally was painful for us both.
"I followed her in the streets, jealously spied on her.
"I believe my passion stimulated her,
"but she was always passive and indecisive.
"We often ended in frightening confrontations
"far from any semblance of reason.
We traveled from town to town evading relatives or lawyers."
No!
"We incarnated the words of the Bible, that man and woman shall be of one flesh."
"Then her husband came and fetched her.
"I was sent to the hospital.
We did not see each other for several years."
You said once that what you liked about me was that God had made me in one piece... that I had whole feelings and whole thoughts.
You said it was important that there were people like me.
It sounded so lovely.
It made me so happy.
I was wrong.
I don't understand a thing.
I don't understand you!
You're nothing but frightened!
And you want to stay here and possibly be killed!
Do you think I want to see you run after that woman, talking to those ghosts, guarding myself all the time?
Do you think I want that?
But I'll stay.
Get up from the table now.
Now walk towards the door.
Now walk through it.
You go down the steps.
It's not dark anymore.
You can find your way.
How delightful!
Welcome!
Carry the tray, please.
Thank you.
It's my supper, you see.
Old Lindhorst, who is worldly, says that old harlots have an unhealthy desire to fill their mouths and stomachs.
You really don't care for anything?
Wasn't there to be a party here this evening?
Not as far as I know.
No, don't leave!
Please help me off with my stockings.
You don't like to touch me.
I sense it clearly.
I don't understand.
Veronica Vogler has come... and I'm the only one who can tell you where she is.
Look closely at my feet, Artist.
Have you seen younger, tighter arches?
Look closely.
Look at my heel, how smooth and fine it is.
Such strong toes and beautiful nails.
Kiss my foot.
Yes, go ahead.
Yes, there!
You've been sweet, and I'll tell you where she is.
Try the west gallery.
She was there five minutes ago.
- Pardon me, I thought...
- You're always welcome, dear friend.
You come, you go, you stay.
You have complete freedom.
Let us speak openly as well.
You have come to find Veronica Vogler.
I should perhaps mention before you see her that Veronica has been my mistress for several years.
She has kindly related in detail your common past.
I can assure you I suffer.
I shall be by your bed tonight.
Every word, every kiss, every movement across your bodies...
Nothing will be spared me.
Come, I'll show the way.
Oh, it's only my jealousy.
Please go away.
Yes, of course.
Of course.
It's Conductor Kreisler playing.
Conductor Kreisler is a master at his instrument.
Don't you think Veronica has waited long enough?
She began preparing for your visit already this morning.
She has become even more beautiful.
My husband is suffering.
He is jealous.
And your touching little companion...
Three shots, one of them fatal.
Wonderful music.
I think I must take off my hat so I can hear better.
It really smells of glue!
Though she insists it is all synthetic.
Plain old glue is what it is.
She can't fool me.
We have our tricks, don't we?
Let's see now if we're presentable.
How pale you are, dear friend.
What a sight!
Your lips are as blue as if you'd eaten blueberries.
We must do something.
Sit down here.
Let's see what we can do.
Right.
A lovely cupid's bow...
A sensual lower lip is always titillating.
Your eyes are swollen and bloodshot.
This will soothe them.
Well, dear me.
And so, a few lines on the eyelids.
There now!
Some fresh color to your skin wouldn't hurt.
Well, what next?
Yes, borrow my robe.
There and there... and there.
And see there.
It suits you, it suits you!
Wait, beautiful pajamas are called for on occasions such as this.
A nice perfume? No?
You prefer to smell of yourself, of course.
Each to his own scent, but a little... gives a scent anyway.
I knew it.
See yourself now in the mirror.
Now you are yourself and yet not yourself, the ideal state for a meeting between lovers.
Come now!
This way!
There is her door.
You see what you want to see!
Veronica, no!
No, them...
Don't pay attention to them!
I thank you... that the limit has finally been transgressed.
The mirror has been shattered.
But what do the splinters reflect?
Can you tell me that?
Yes, he fired three shots.
One scratched my arm.
I still have a little scar.
I fell over from sheer terror.
I thought it best to lie still.
I heard him pace back and forth, behind and around the house... then he ran toward the path.
I stood up, went inside, washed off the blood, and put on a bandage.
Then I hid the pistol and sat down to wait.
He was gone some minutes, then he came running back.
I hid myself to be on the safe side.
He looked absolutely insane.
He walked around the cottage talking to himself... then he got out the diary and began to write.
He wrote for hours.
Then by mid-morning he packed his satchel and headed off toward the woods.
I thought it best to follow him.
He might harm himself.
Don't you see me?
- Where is he?
- I know where you can find him.
Come.
Call to him, then.
Well, there is one thing
I've wondered.
Are you in a hurry?
I'd like to ask you something.
It's like this.
Isn't it true that when a woman has lived a long time with a man... isn't it true she finally becomes like that man?
Since she loves him and tries to think like him and see like him.
They say that it can change a person.
Was that why
I began to see those ghosts?
Or were they there anyway?
I mean, if I'd loved him less and not bothered about everything there around him... could I have protected him better then?
Or was it that I didn't love him enough that made me so jealous?
Was that why those "cannibals," as he called them... was that why we came to such grief?
I thought I was so close to him.
Sometimes he said he was also close to me.
One time he said it with certainty.
If only I could have followed him, all the time.
There's so much to keep pondering... so many questions, sometimes
I don't know which way is which, and I get completely...
Don't crowd ! 
Hello! 
What? 
Don't shoot 
Don't shoot 
Why do you act like this? 
Don't shoot 
Captain 
Stop! Don't shoot 
Don't shoot 
Yangzi 
Unlock me 
Oh 
No 
The dear one 
It is boring 
The dear one 
Ask you 
Let's rescue that person! 
Have asked you 
Have asked you 
Have asked you 
He is a kindhearted person, he is a confident person 
He is a strong person too, everybody has got his kind consideration 
He is a person with principle 
Hope he can get the liking of God , amen. 
Amen. 
Let him remove the smoke of gunpowder of this world, resume the life carefree , amen. 
Amen. 
Soul of letting that of his purified, 
Come back to god side, amen. 
Wish him to be full of good mood , amen forever. 
Wish him to live calmly in the world without smoke of gunpowder 
Wish God will be your daughter as soon as possible ….
Oh, I am sorry 
Caizi 
What? 
Are you tired? 
It has been already very late, what are you doing? 
Priest gentleman 
I …
My memory is a bit fuzzy ….
There are various difficulties in life 
There is not anything that can not be stood 
Stand? 
Needn't worry 
Forget 
Let's go to have a meal together 
OK. 
Express gratitude to God for granting us food, amen 
Obtain the award 
Priest 
Have just caught two fish 
Will cook with them this evening 
They are very beautiful 
Catch recently 
See my craftsmanship 
It seems I pray to God 
Fault that God forgave me 
Such has a share of mine too 
Why? 
That is colored my money 
Or all of us needn't pray 
What if we eat the raw sliced fish ? 
Give to me! 
Then has requested you 
I ate a moment later 
Very heavy 
Oh, Jonny 
Wait and eat for you a moment later 
Whether can lend Caizi to me 
Go to outside to relieve boredom? 
Borrow? 
I will have a rest tomorrow 
How about it? 
Since noon 
Half a day 
OK 
Mr.Tongxue 
I am sorry, I am late 
It doesn't matter, let's go 
Let me have a try of 
Good stimulus 
I talk about a thing to you 
You mustn't say to the priest 
You seem to like the priest very much 
Is what you said the thing taught together? 
Hey? 
The priest is my benefactor 
Without the priest, how I now have not known that will turn into 
Then when do you plan to get married? 
Wait for me to put down the burden in the heart 
Father died when I had not been born in yet 
Mother died too when I am little 
My only elder sister. Three years ago ….. 
Don't say 
You should not be always cranky 
Why do not you always think they has died ? 
Don't be angry 
You should catch the happiness at the moment 
Get married at once 
Petty fellow 
See later 
What do you want to do? 
Disagreeable 
This fellow of yours 
I love you 
Needn't worry 
Here's me 
We will play together tomorrow, you are not unhappy , heartily …
A pair of appearances that will cry, haha, 
Where did the elder sister die? 
How did your elder sister die? 
Three years ago, it was at the port of Yokohama too 
There was such rain too at that time 
Perhaps it is because of the reason of the typhoon 
Without evidence, no one sees 
And 
The elder sister's corpse is not found either 
Don't draw a conclusion first 
Don't go to Legend either 
Often in such weather 
How is the elder sister in the sea 
I always feel that there is a sound that is saying 
Her life is in privation 
This kind of feeling is very strong 
There are too much ones that don't think 
Those are all illusion, don't worry oneself needlessly again 
No, 
In the childhood , there was soul reaction between us 
What kind of feeling does elder sister has 
I can feel the feeling of the elder sister 
Glad, or sad 
May not have such a thing 
Even if you are the twins 
But she had already died 
So, are not in charge of ? 
The ship? 
It is a freighter 
The ship? Not rare! 
Caizi, what do you do? 
I will get the ship to get on 
Caizi, what's the matter? 
Caizi 
Caizi 
We lay up for west along the course according to schedule 
When our honeymoon trip will reach the destination soon 
I suddenly had one kind of ominous premonitions 
When will arrive soon inshorly as expected 
The pirates emerged in another side at last 
The pirates have strengthened and taken precautious 
Laijian, Fujin, all of us have resisted 
But ….
Oh 
Elder sister 
Heartily …….. 
Caizi may have met the accident 
Must believe God 
Let's pray together 
Caizi 
Caizi 
Caizi she believes God 
So long as believe in God 
God is sure to help her 
Bat 
Elder sister 
Caizi 
Come slowly , don't worry 
Caizi 
Caizi 
What do you do? 
It is not Caizi 
Zhenxia 
What? 
Dubian? 
Yes 
In my view not so good as asking the police to get hold of him 
Hey 
Anything that you talked nonsense here just now! 
Really cherish the memory of over very much 
I do not want to run into you 
What do you do? 
Hello! 
Unlock me, unlock me 
Why catch me? 
I am inclined to do it in this way 
Because those words you said just now 
Stand up! 
Tell you not to come to my shop 
Are your ears deaf ? 
If I saw you again, I would kill you! 
Come with me 
Do not use it like this? 
I have a thing to tell you 
I have seen your wife 
Where? 
LONGWANGWAN 
Wretch 
It is true, is really your wife 
I saw her at the station yesterday 
That woman is still alive 
Don't say again 
Unlock! 
If it is such 
I will certainly not miss you 
Please listen to me having a word 
We are all on a ship 
Everyone can not run 
These three years, I lived in the fear 
Can be outstanding 
Must pay 
Oh ….
Not forgetting you talked about originally 
But you were voluntary at that time 
I have seen her, I have seen her 
Youli 
I beg your pardon, It's nothing 
Wine. Wine. Wine ….
Give me wine 
Give me wine 
Remember it is the last time this time 
Afterwards don't be coming 
Very unhappy appearance 
Already very careful 
Don't always keep a straight face 
Mr.Zhenxia has not seen others yet till now 
I like you for your sample 
Oh …Still lovely 
Mr.Zhenxia, don't pretend the appearance of the man of moral integrity 
Reconsider 
What are you doing? 
What a shame! 
Please go back tonight 
Why? 
Uncomfortable 
I order you 
Disagreeable 
Go back 
You have come back 
But you seldom come back once! 
Your face is not good 
What happened? 
Too tired 
The dear one 
Tongxue 
Welcome 
Some things want to talk to you today 
Have you found Caizi? 
Have a look at one here first 
Priest gentleman, 
Suddenly walk 
I want to explain it 
But even I myself am unable to explain 
Even you have not seen that go to one side , Caizi 
Hou we can meet and then when what does it wonder 
Really very sorry 
In order to revenge 
I have to be like this 
Now, I can not explain to priest in person 
Priest 
When that can be said 
I must all tell you 
Tongxue 
Hopeless 
Let's try to pray to God 
See whether can persuade her 
If it is the grass 
Always have one day injured 
Priest 
Hello, Mr.Zhinan 
It will rain soon 
All right? 
Do not have! 
With great difficulty , have chosen the place 
Don't fish 
Should be careful! 
Meet again 
Go ….
Roll.. Get away 
Please have tickets checked 
Do you also want the stub? 
What is done? 
Be quicker! 
If have made mistakes 
Where to go to look for the wife! 
What is said? Your discredited boy 
You are a changeable fellow 
Changeable 
Hey hey …Beautiful wife 
It is really regrettable, the wretch 
Don't say the dirty word 
You are very disagreeable ! 
You do not say again either, well ...
I just see the card 
Have not reached you yet! 
Hope this is a good card 
This card is too small 
It seems that I will fail! 
Fail …Heartily ….
Drop dead! 
Who lose the words, would lose 50 million soon 
See what card has appeared 
Hey hey ….. 
Peng! 
Why won yet the wretch? 
The same as you said 
Someone won for a moment 
Win …Who won? 
Hey hey ….
Two people fight, 
Certainly is it the onlooker that has won 
No matter who he is to win, 
Anyway it is not you that win 
Wretch 
Tricker! 
Why is so centralized ? 
There is no reason! 
You are going mad again! 
I WIN! 
Hey hey ….. 
I am sorry 
The chance has come 
Oh ….. 
Have used a piece of odd and married a wife 
Owing first 
I fly like bird 
Water flows like air 
The time of today is not wasted 
I, during the age like you 
It is peerless early 
On LONGWANGWAN in that year, 
I am the first too 
Even it is now, I am still very strong, hey hey 
Move about, continue playing 
Don't play mahjong again 
Enormous discredited mouse hiding in the wall is sewn 
Person flowing like water 
Comfortable 
Leave from here when it is dark 
If it is such, 
We have to search the straits 
Why? 
For a long time 
Don't play mahjong again 
What is he doing? 
Oh ….. 
Hello, Jitian 
You are rich, different as expected 
It seems to be to play abroad 
Liked by the woman as expected 
If you looked for trouble again, 
I call the police 
In no mood, let's go back 
Don't lie 
You had better be a bit more careful 
You mustn't talk nonsense again 
Why is not there confidence in this way? 
Explain the focal point 
Already unable to live at home, here is terrified 
Whether sister-in-law, stay at home 
You should consider attentively! 
Hello ….
There are no sports for a long time 
Always work desperately for the previous period 
According to your present health 
Don't go 
Wretch 
Are you Mr.Tongxue? 
And there is work today 
When 's thing? 
Please wait a moment 
OK 
Really hope you can often come as yesterday 
What happened? 
The accident happens 
I go to send for a doctor 
Human bones 
Axe 
Well …Feel blue, 
Go back 
Hello …How 
Help 
Oh …
Oh 
Caizi 
Caizi 
I will never unlock you 
Do not unlock 
Caizi 
Don't be continuing, 
Understand? 
You seem very uncomfortable 
Go with my Islam hall 
I beg your pardon, what on earth is the matter? 
Why do not you come back ? 
Caizi 
Have asked you 
Don't force me again 
Force you 
The person who forces you is not me. 
I am sorry 
Do not you like me? 
Not just 
Why is that? 
Why not make it clear? 
Can't say 
Can't say 
Caizi …
Priest 
I am a terrific woman 
As a person, I have a task 
In order to finish that task 
Priest gentleman 
There are main threads to wait for the thing. Being sure to come back, I ask God's pardon 
Well …If you continued like this 
God will not forgive you 
All bad persons or clean person 
God will punish they are or clean to return they 
Why will you take action secretly? 
Because my elder sister is really suffering hardships 
I want to let those insult person of the elder sister , taste the bitter pill 
Are they that you said pirates robing without restraint in those sea area nearby? 
The elder sister has told me the characteristics of those five people 
Is your elder sister on that ship too? 
She has rested in peace on LONGWANGWAN 
Your elder sister return, OK? 
What's the matter with you? 
Do not know 
But 
I can see her clear 
Can hear her voice 
Even if my elder sister deceives me 
I would rather too be deceived by her 
Priest gentleman 
Elder sister and I are the twins 
From beginning in the childhood 
No matter what happened to the elder sister, 
Even not say 
No matter what kind of feelings elder sister has, 
What I can feel will come out 
Mine, when being uncomfortable 
The elder sister will be uncomfortable 
If elder sister has been injured 
My chest is known the shouting pain, 
Bleeding 
But 
She is hurt by the base person 
Suffering hardships 
Only there is myself left in life now 
God 
When can remedy the wound in your heart 
I ask you to forgive them from the heart 
Priest gentleman 
God's good news can not save them 
Do not then make them stay 
The so-called arrangement, is probably this meaning 
I can't stop , 
This seems very difficult 
I do not know either how many people they have 
But …
I do not make them revive 
Even if flow and try the blood best , 
I want to remove them all too 
Such a evil person, we should have spacious mind, go to forgive them 
Give them a chance even if a sinner 
Don't laugh at and rub , 
If accomplish like this, 
You are doing the good thing 
Such a person, wake the intuitive knowledge in their heart up with the love 
To retaliate against them better with the severe means 
Those die-hard devils , 
The means to use reprimanding and violence is of no use 
God will go to punish them at this time 
Don't give up , love common people with your love 
God will try the contribution and fault of common people 
The sinner will get the due punishment finally 
There are a lot of frustrations on the way of leading to correctly, 
You want the brave climbing upwards 
Let's cry out 
Let's put down the burden in the heart 
Let's cry out heartily 
Can't be put down without anything 
Thing 
Relax as at ordinary times , 
Don't be struggling 
You have been covered the eyes by the devil 
Only eliminate the devil in your heart. 
Let that devil get away 
All right, having a rest hard of this evening 
Have thought of nothing 
Like me 
Your rest hard 
I will pray for you 
Priest gentleman 
Caizi 
Caizi 
Who? 
We have met again 
Me 
Cunning partner , 
Unexpectedly has become a priest 
What is said? 
I do not know what you are saying 
Take off 
Boss 
Very good, you understood at last 
Except the boss 
The others all died 
Even my wives all died 
But, boss, what she even people in Europe can feel arrives, 
This is too difficult to manage 
Has not changed yet, have you forgotten? 
You have been trained by strict physical power in China, have superstrong physical power 
We ...
Ones that will not meet accident 
There are skills that must see who rivals are too 
However, the eldest 
The ghost is not what we can deal with 
The ghost ? 
A wife of Xiwu 
The eldest, Heiye their capital is killed 
Heartily ….
That can not be stood by them 
But ….
Her younger sister 
The twins 
Twins? 
Very lovely child 
Actually she went to school in Tokyo, 
But there is very wonderful soul reaction between she and her elder sister 
She comes here to revenge for her elder sister 
Your wife has died, give her to you 
This evening 
It is your festival 
Don't joke ! 
I am not such a person . 
Even children do not miss 
Say that pass 
You became strong again at last 
Hey hey …
I have doubt 
But ….Is not that our thing? 
Listen to me saying the general process, 
You know 
General process 
Don't joke again 
It seems to be a sound of LONGWANGWAN? 
LONGWANGWAN? 
Caizi 
Caizi 
Caizi 
Priest 
Qiao Ni 
Careful 
Oh. 
Oh …….
Your women have all died, 
You are still really amazing 
Who? 
Oh ….. 
Oh ….
Mali 
Eldest 
Detian? 
Have disappeared? 
Oh ….
Xiwu? 
Heartily ….
It is the eldest that Mr.Lv is not lost 
You will really try to give a false impression ! 
Not only will disguise but also run into China 
Was what has been escaped lost you think? 
Three years ago , committed the fault that can't be forgiven 
It's time to finish at last now 
Zhinan, Xiaolin and Caoda 
Have already turned into the material of the experiment 
Even you …Become my experiment material 
Xiwu 
Have set me free 
I have known by mistake 
I do not want to try to be a good fellow 
I will be gentle to yours. 
Really want to eat the meat 
Is it here? Really prove to be and known as the wretch 
Caizi? 
Hold the good fortune of the elder sister, 
I have a lot of trouble to find the chief instigators of the backstage 
Priest gentleman 
Unexpectedly are you 
That blood …
Those blood, what meaning you see? 
You have killed the elder sister of Mr.Xiwu and me 
Unexpectedly has also pitched and on my elder sister's heart 
Priest gentleman 
Do not know the person who you like together most 
Who is it on earth? 
If …
Person you like go from you far because of crime constantly 
The person that you loved has made baits because of you 
Don't be noisy 
Can not stand 
The person that you love and died for justice? 
So 
The devil should go to die 
Talk nonsense! 
No …
No …
Oh …
Elder sister 
Elder sister 
The devils have been all punished dully 
Have all disappeared 
Don't think again . 
It was very good that you did 
Leave …
Let's go back 
I love you 
I love you 
The dear one 
Caizi.. 
Go back quickly 
Leave …
Fast …
Oh …Oh ……
Tongxue,
I am sorry 
Caizi

- Mornin'. Taxi?
- That's right.
- American?
- How d'you figure it out?
Your clothes don't fit proper!
- Maybe you can recommend a tailor.
- Too much responsibility.
Tailoring's personal.
You here on holiday?
Sorte. I'm going to the Witley place.
You're not.
- Something wrong?
- Nothing wrong.
- Can you tell me how to get there?
- No. Sorry, mate.
- I wonder if you could help me.
- Possibly.
I'm anxious to get to the Witley place.
Sorry. I can't help you.
Can you help me?
Excuse me. This man following me.
He's asking for the Witley place.
Here he comes.
Hello. Is there any place around here where I can rent an automobile?
No. Bicycle, maybe.
Where are you going?
- The Witley place.
- You're wasting your time.
- How d'you figure that?
- The Witley place!
He wants to go to the Witley place!
Anything wrong with wanting to go there?
- Is there anything wrong with that?
- Well, is there?
- Bicycle shop's down the street.
- "ls there?" he asks!
- Hello.
- Something you want?
I'd like to rent a bicycle for a few days.
Where would you be riding it?
I'll pay for it in advance.
- I asked where you'd be going.
- To the Witley place.
- I'd need a bicycle, wouldn't l?
- Yes.
And more than that.
You'll not be using one of mine.
Why? You've got loads.
I don't see anybody waiting.
- No bicycles for rent.
- What about the motor?
I've nothing for rent.
What will it cost to get to the Witley place?
More than anything you have to offer.
Why? What's the matter with everybody in this town?
Nothing's the matter. Here.
Just what's that supposed to mean?
It means the only way you can get to the Witley house from here is on your own two feet.
Hello?
Hello?
How do you do? There was no answer so I took the liberty of entering.
The signs clearly say to keep out.
You must have seen them.
Oh, yes. I saw them.
By what right have you entered this house?
- I've come to visit the Witleys.
- Oh? I am Nahum Witley.
Well, sir, actually it's Susan
I came to visit.
Susan? My daughter's not receiving visitors.
I must ask you to leave.
- This the way you treat your guests?
- Guests? Guests are invited.
- I don't remember inviting you.
- Oh, I have been invited.
By Mrs Witley.
"Stephen Reinhart".
You are Stephen Reinhart?
Uh, yeah. That's right.
My daughter did mention your name.
She met you in America at university?
- We were in the same science class.
- Science!
It would disturb Mrs Witley to see you.
Again, I must ask you to leave.
- It isn't her I've come to see.
- Quite impossible.
I will have Merwyn take you to the village.
Steve!
Susan will ask you to stay.
But for reasons I cannot go into,
I must insist you tell her that you have to leave at once. Merwyn!
Get the car.
Steve!
Susan!
- You look great!
- I thought you'd never get here.
- It's only been a month.
- Is that all?
- Father, this is Stephen Reinhart.
- I know.
- I must speak to you alone, Susan.
- I'll take him to meet Mother.
It's forbidden for your mother to have visitors.
Only for a minute.
Mother's been waiting to meet Steve.
I had no idea you lived in a house so, uh... sumptuous.
This is my great-grandfather, Elias Witley.
He built this house over 150 years ago.
This next one?
It's my grandfather, Corbin Witley.
Oh? What did he do?
He went insane.
We must get rid of him, Merwyn.
He must not stay.
Steve, you must understand about Mother. She's not well.
Mother?
Come in and close the door.
Mother, this is Stephen Reinhart.
We have been expecting you.
I'm, uh... I'm sorry you're not feeling well, Mrs Witley.
It will pass.
You are a welcome guest in this house, Mr Reinhart.
- Thank you.
- My husband will protest.
- But I shall speak to him. Susan?
- Yes?
I would like to speak to Stephen alone.
Yes, Mother.
Please, sit down.
I am glad that you have come at this time.
Merwyn!
Merwyn, are you all right?
Yes, sir.
I'm going to need your help.
You can trust me, sir.
- About what, Mrs Witley?
- Come here.
Closer.
That box, Mr Reinhart, there.
Open it.
- It's an earring.
- Yes.
It's an earring.
Take it out of the box. Examine it.
- Looks like gold.
- Yes. It's gold.
But its importance doesn't lie in the metal it is made of.
- I'm afraid I don't understand.
- Why should you?
You probably think this whole house is obsessed with mystery.
I tell you, that single earring you are holding is surrounded by mystery.
It... It belonged to my maid, Helga.
She was a nice simple girl and completely devoted to me.
Well, about a month ago, she went down with some terrible disease.
I begged her to go to the doctor in Arkham.
- Did she go?
- No.
No, I don't think she did.
Chains for devils!
Whatever it was, she seemed to be overcome by... by something, well... Well, it almost seemed like self-loathing.
She took to wearing a veil as if to hide herself from prying eyes.
Why, um...
Why is the earring so important?
About a fortnight ago, she came here to see me.
She was crying.
She said she was... she was frightened of what was happening to her.
- What was happening to her?
- I don't know.
I'm not sure.
Anyway, she left, and she dropped that earring.
Stephen, I haven't seen her since.
Well, perhaps Mr Witley knows.
My husband says he knows nothing.
Stephen, it's because of all these things that I had to be sure of you.
You are my one hope for Susan.
Take her away from here as soon as you can. Tomorrow. The next day.
You must promise me. My husband may not allow me to speak to you again.
I must have your promise now.
- What did you talk about?
- What? Oh! You.
I want you to know,
I have the parental blessing.
Well, half of it, anyway.
- My room's supposed to be down here.
- I'll show you.
This is the room. I'll have Merwyn bring up your case.
Susan, how long has your mother been like that?
Ill, you mean?
Well, that and the uh, darkened room, shaded bed.
Not long.
She's been worse the past few days.
And the doctor's forbidden her to have any visitors?
No, she hasn't seen a doctor.
Father wants to look after her himself.
- And what about Helga?
- Helga?
Why all these questions?
Your mother's very concerned about her.
She's disappeared.
Susan, what's going on here?
I don't know, Steve.
What else did you and Mother talk about?
Come here.
Your mother did ask whether my intentions were honourable.
- Are they, Steve?
- What do you think?
You shouldn't have invited Reinhart here.
You're a difficult woman, Letitia.
No. Not difficult.
Only afraid.
Oh, so that's it, huh?
The sins of the fathers, huh?
Well, let me warn you, nothing is going to deter me from my purpose.
- Yes, that's what Corbin said.
- He's dead, Letitia.
He's been dead for a long time.
If there was evil, it's buried with him.
All that remains of Corbin is a few harmless objects in the cellar.
- No! You know how light pains me!
- Why persist in this delusion?
Please, Nahum, close the curtains. Please.
I wonder if you realise how like Corbin you've become.
There's no similarity whatsoever.
I've uttered no incantations.
Neither have I cried out to any of the other so-called... creatures of evil.
- It's only your methods that differ.
- And do you know why?
Because I don't believe in it.
I never have believed in it.
It is you who would perpetuate these blasphemies, these absurdities.
Nahum, I saw your father change from an upright God-fearing man into an old man possessed of the devil.
Whatever happened to my father will not happen to me.
It's already happening.
I could see it happening to you,
Letitia, not to me.
It's happening to all of us.
There's evidence of it all around us.
There is nothing to do with Corbin Witley.
Corbin was invoking the dark powers when he died.
Now, his call is being answered.
So that is why you sent for Stephen Reinhart.
I sent for him to take Susan away.
- What have you told him?
- Nothing.
- Are you sure?
- I don't need to tell him anything.
- He can see for himself.
- I don't want him here.
- One way or another, he must leave.
- He is a guest here, Nahum.
I will not have him interfering.
Would you prefer that I went into the town and showed myself?
The once beautiful Letitia Witley.
Very well.
A day, perhaps, but no more.
Then he must leave.
Well, perhaps by then you will have seen the truth.
The truth?
The truth is that I see the future, and all that I've planned will fill it with a richness we've never known.
Yes, that is what you see.
All that I can see is horror.
Horror!
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a very large room.
Big enough for a king's banquet.
There used to be many parties here in my great-grandfather's time.
- But none since?
- None that I remember.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
Perhaps the name of Witley no longer commands the affection and respect it once did.
Is that why no one in the village would drive me out here?
- You had to walk all that way?
- Mm.
The villagers have no use for us,
Mr Reinhart. The feeling is mutual.
- Merwyn.
- Yes?
Has Mrs Witley had her dinner?
I placed a tray before her, but she didn't want it.
I'll take her up something a little later, Father.
What was that?
Uh, Mr Witley, I um... noticed a strange blackened area on the way to the house.
What happened there?
- There was a fire, Steve.
- A fire?
- Why do you say it like that?
- Well, did you see it?
No, but Father did.
- Why are you so curious?
- Everything is dead in the area.
Nothing grows.
I touched a branch and it fell to ashes.
My daughter had already told you.
There was a fire.
But, Mr Witley, no fire leaves a place like that.
Father's never allowed me to go on the heath.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
After the fire, some villagers disappeared there.
No one's ever explained what happened.
I think, Susan, you're inclined to exaggerate.
I would suggest that you both...
Merwyn!
- What's the matter with him?
- This has happened before.
- But he's unconscious.
- It's perfectly all right.
I know exactly what to do. Susan.
Come on, Steve.
Steve.
Mother? I've brought your dinner.
It's your favourite.
- Take it away.
- You must eat.
Sh.
Quiet, child.
Listen.
- What is it?
- Sh! Quiet.
Yes. Yes!
- Steve!
- What's wrong, honey?
- I saw something outside the window.
- What? Who?
I don't know, but something was staring at me.
Are you sure you weren't imagining it?
- Oh, I don't know. It's this house!
- What about this house, Susan?
There's something in it, something smothering.
- I'm taking you away.
- I wish I could...
- Tonight!
- I can't.
- Why?
- I can't leave Mother how she is.
First she couldn't stand the light.
Now she won't eat.
It was your mother who made me promise to take you away.
- I want to go.
- We're leaving right away.
- It's impossible.
- Tomorrow morning, then.
I'm afraid she won't be any better in the morning.
Oh, Steve. I wish I knew what to do.
- Steve!
- What?
The window!
- Nothing. It's your imagination.
- I'm not imagining it.
We'll discuss it tomorrow.
Now, you have to get some rest.
Oh, Steve. I love you.
And I love you.
Everything's gonna be all right.
It came from downstairs.
- Where does this go?
- It leads to Merwyn's room.
- Father!
- You shouldn't come here.
But the screaming and the noise.
It's Merwyn. He's dead.
It was terrible.
Please go back to your rooms.
Nobody can do anything to help now.
Now, wait a minute.
What's this all about? How did he die?
- He's been ill for a long time.
- Where's the body?
- That's none of your business.
- I think it is my business.
- No, Steve...
- You don't realise what's happened.
This is my house. I ask you to allow me to run my own affairs my own way.
- But a man is dead!
- Steve!
- Get dressed. We're gonna leave now.
- I can't leave now, Steve.
Please don't make trouble.
Good night.
Good night.
- Yes?
- Is the doctor in?
- Did you have an appointment?
- No, but I'd like to speak to him.
- Is it an emergency?
- It's important that I speak to him.
Come inside.
This way.
- You wanted to speak to me?
- Dr Henderson? Steve Reinhart.
I had to talk to you.
Nobody in the village recommended me,
I'm sure.
- I found you in the phone book.
- I've been out of practice for some time.
I didn't come to see you in your professional capacity.
I... Something funny's happening.
The family I'm staying with may be involved.
- Why come to me? Oh, drink?
- No, thanks. It's a little early.
I thought someone objective could help me, give me some information.
- About what?
- About the people I'm staying with.
Why was everyone frightened when I said where I was going?
Frightened? You're talking about the Witley place.
Only "Witley" could bring out that reaction.
- Can you tell me why?
- Sorry, I can't tell you anything.
An old man died out there last night.
I don't give one damn what happened there, neither does this village.
You're scared. You're a doctor, don't you have pride in what you are?
- I may have seen a murder.
- Murder?
- That's right.
- I'm sorry, I can't help. Go away.
You too. What's happened here?
Why is there that fear when "Witley" is mentioned?
Miss Bailey.
Will you show Mr Reinhart to the door?
You asked the doctor about the Witley place.
Can you tell me anything about it, anything about the Witleys?
Only this. Dr Henderson was a good doctor, a wonderful man.
Corbin Witley died in Dr Henderson's arms.
Dr Henderson returned from that visit and he's never been the same.
- What did Corbin Witley die from?
- It's never spoken of.
On the death certificate it said cerebral haemorrhage, but there was no autopsy because there was no funeral, and I'll tell you why.
With the exception of Dr Henderson, no one in the village saw the body.
I've said enough.
I've said more than I ought.
Mother?
Mother, please let me in.
- Susan, dear.
- I heard her moving about.
- Mother, please open this door.
- It's all right. I'll talk to her.
- I've tried to...
- I know, dear. Now, you go along.
I'll talk to her.
Letitia, I must speak to you.
It's very important.
Letitia!
But no one ever goes to the greenhouse at night.
If there was no one inside, why was there a light?
- A light?
- The entire greenhouse... the only word I can think of is glowed.
I've seen a glow like that before, in a radiation lab.
I don't understand. What were you doing outside last night?
- I was watching your father.
- Father?
- What was he doing?
- Burying Merwyn.
- Something else has happened, too.
- What?
I was attacked on the heath.
I'm sure it was Helga.
Oh, Steve.
What's happening?
- Why is the greenhouse locked?
- It never has been before.
- Well, it is now.
- Well, it shouldn't be.
- Have you been in it lately?
- Not since I've been back.
Come on.
Letitia, now listen to me.
It's very important.
I should have done this before.
I'm going to take you to the village, to see the doctor.
Letitia.
How long have these windows been whitewashed?
- They've always been whitewashed.
- There.
- I've never seen that lock before.
- Is there any other way in?
Steve, I don't think we should.
The answer to what's going on may be inside. We've got to get in.
I know a way.
When I was a child, I'd hide from
Merwyn when Mother sent him for me.
I used to get in somewhere here.
Here it is.
- I see it, but I don't believe it.
- How could plants grow like this?
It's fantastic!
Yeah.
How can this happen?
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Remember the cry we heard at dinner last night?
I heard one just like it this morning.
What's in there?
It used to be a potting shed.
Oh, come on, Steve!
It's dark in there, except for a kind of glow.
Oh, Steve! Please come away!
We can't. There's something going on that's affecting all your family.
We shouldn't.
If Father finds out he'll be furious.
Let him. We're not leaving with questions unanswered. Stay here.
No.
- I'm coming with you.
- OK. Come on.
- What is it?
- Those flickering colours.
It must be some kind of energy.
Uranium!
This room is being exposed to some form of radiation.
It's horrible.
It looks like a zoo in hell.
Oh, come on, Steve! Come on!
It's all right!
A menagerie of horrors.
What were they?
Genetic mutations, probably caused by radiation.
It's a scientific fact that exposure to radioactive energy can change characteristics of living things.
It's what happened to these plants, to those creatures.
The scent in here. It's so sweet.
It's sickening.
It's the effect of decay.
- Steve, what is it?
- There's something down here.
This stone's like the ones in the potting shed.
What is it, Steve?
I don't know. I've never seen anything like it before. I wonder if it's an element.
It's giving off heat!
Looks like it's been cut away from some larger stone.
There's one under every plant.
This is the answer. No doubt about it.
- The stones?
- Yeah.
They make everything in here grow this way?
Yeah, and in there, too.
Oh, but Steve!
If it does this to plants...
Exactly, if it affects plants this way after hours and days of exposure, what would it do to a human being?
Mother and Helga.
They worked in here.
Merwyn must have come in contact with these stones, or the larger one from which they were cut!
I wonder where the larger stone could be.
I don't know. In the cellar, perhaps.
- The cellar!
- There are many rooms down there.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yes.
Letitia.
Letitia!
That's the door.
- You stay here.
- You won't find the way.
- I will. Now, go upstairs.
- Oh, Steve. Be careful.
Don't worry.
Where's Reinhart?
I've been looking for him.
- What happened? Where have you been?
- The greenhouse.
- I put a lock on.
- I knew another way in.
- You had no right.
- Why have you kept it a secret?
- Was Reinhart with you?
- Yes.
- Is he still there?
- No.
Where is he? Where is he?
- You're hurting me!
- Tell me where he is.
- He's in the cellar.
- The cellar!
- Father!
- Stay there!
Get out of this room.
I said, get out.
No. Not until you listen to what I have to say.
- I'm in no mood for words!
- Would you prefer death?
- Don't threaten me.
- Everything in this house will die.
Get rid of that stone and the smaller ones, or this house will become like the burned-out area, those monstrosities.
- You don't know what you're saying.
- It destroyed Merwyn.
You want it to destroy your wife,
Susan, destroy you?
- No.
- Listen to that humming sound.
Look at the way it glows.
- It's only a stone. It's harmless.
- You don't believe that, Mr Witley.
You know what it can do.
You know Mrs Witley needs a doctor!
Susan. Are you all right?
- Susan!
- Oh, Steve.
What happened?
It's all right. I got you now.
Susan, are you all right?
- What happened to your mother?
- I don't know.
I heard her smashing things.
I tried to get her to come out.
And then the door burst open and I screamed.
I don't remember anything after that.
Can you get up now?
- I think so.
- Come on.
- Are you OK?
- I'll be all right.
I must find Letitia.
- I must help.
- No. Come on.
Letitia!
Letitia!
Come on.
Letitia!
Let's try this way.
Letitia!
Father?
It's only the wind. Come on.
Letitia.
Steve!
No!
Reinhart, get my daughter out of here.
Please take Susan away.
The evil that Corbin created has finally come to root here.
I refused to listen to her entreaties.
Now Letitia's paid with her life for Corbin's blasphemies.
And my own, too.
Mr Witley, blasphemy had nothing to do with it.
In my heart, I must have known that she was right.
It is as she said.
A curse is set upon this house.
How could I have been so blind as not to know that stone was sent from the other side by the hand of Corbin, reaching out from beyond the grave?
- A curse?
- What do you know of this house?
- Or the people who've lived in it?
- The stone was not sent by anyone.
It's easy for you to say that, but you didn't see it that Sunday morning, screaming out of the heavens to crash and bury itself in the heath.
It fell from the sky!
Then it was a meteorite.
I thought it was a gift from Heaven.
The people from the village came to see, but they wouldn't come near it.
They knew because the fear of Corbin was still in them.
The next morning, the heath was covered with a lush vegetation that should never have grown there.
Why did you bring it into the house?
Why?
Because I thought, as Corbin knew I would...
I thought I'd found a way to turn the wasteland into a place of beauty.
Great vineyards, gardens.
That was my dream.
I thought the name of Witley would mean something once again, and Corbin's iniquities would be atoned for.
Everyone he came in contact with was touched by it.
Father, please come back into the house.
Susan! Stephen, will you take Susan away, please?
What about you?
I will stay here to destroy this monstrous thing.
If you go near it, there can only be one result, and you know what it is.
You seem to forget this is my home.
I live here.
And l, like my father and his father before him, was born here.
I'm an old man and if I'm to die,
- I will die here.
- I'm not leaving without you, Father.
Susan, there's nothing we can do.
Let's go.
Something dreadful's going to happen.
Now, please!
Susan, go with Stephen.
Go away! Go away!
Come on. Let's go and pack.
Helga!
That'll do. Come on.
- Father!
- Stay here.
Mr Witley!
Susan! Get back!
Come on.
Get over there. When I say run, head for the door. Go ahead.
No!
Come on!
- Run, Susan! Run!
- Steve!
Susan! Susan! Hold on!
Oh, Steve.
We're going and we're not gonna look back.
I don't understand, Steve.
Why did all this have to happen?
I don't think it had to happen.
In scientific hands, your father's discovery could have been beneficial.
He used it to fight the only way he knew, for his house and the Witley name.
It was his choice and he made it.
Come on, let's get outta here.

It'll be two quid.
Shut the door.
No!
- What's going on here?
- Murder.
- No.
- One of the girls.
What paper are you from?
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, what paper are you from?
- Oh. The Observer.
- Oh.
Come on. Let's take a photograph of you.
- I can't help thinking of that poor girl.
- Shocking, isn't it?
- You're late.
- Sorry, sir.
Hold on, Mark.
I've got a question for you.
Which magazine sells the most copies?
Those with girls on the front covers... and no front covers on the girls.
Exactly. 
It's just the same with the work you do for me.
Look busy.
- The Times, please. Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else, sir?
- And the Telegraph.
Anything else?
I'm told by a friend that you have some views for sale.
- What sort of views, sir?
- Hmm?
Well...
This sort, sir?
Yes, thank you.
Yes.
- Morning, Mr. Peter.
- Morning.
- Can I have a Crunch, please?
- Help yourself, my dear.
Thank you.
- How much each?
- They're five shillings each, sir.
Oh, well, I'll have that one. 
Yeah.
Oh, and that.
- How much would the lot be?
- To you, five pounds, sir.
- Five pounds.
- Well, uh, I'll tell you what, sir.
I'll make it four pounds ten.
And I'll throw in the Times and the Telegraph. 
How's that?
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome. Let me wrap it for you, sir.
- Shall I... Shall I put you on our mailing list?
- Oh, no.
No. No. No.
I'll- I'll look in again.
Very well, sir.
Thank you.
- Oh, uh, your papers, sir.
- Papers?
- Times and Telegraph.
- Oh, yes. Of course.
Silly of me.
Thank you very much, sir.
Well, he won't be doing the crossword tonight.
Well, look who's here.
Cecil Beaton.
Her name is Lorraine.
Well, come on, sonny.
Make us famous.
Did you read about that girl that was murdered last night?
Same thing nearly happened to me.
- Oh? When?
- Last night.
I went out with my boyfriend.
Getting married next month.
Trouble was my fiance saw us.
Can you fix it so the bruises don't show?
- Well, can you?
- I think so, Milly.
Be quick about it, sonny.
I'm melting.
There he goes again. 
What have you got under there? A girlfriend?
I suppose you have a girlfriend.
- No, Milly.
- Hear that, Lorraine? He's available.
Raise your head and look at the sea, please.
What sea?
What sea?
- I just wanted that puzzled look.
- Oh, did you?
Well, if you want it again,
I'll think of you.
- Hold it.
- You're a puzzle and a half.
- This is a spare-time job for you, isn't it?
- Yes, Milly.
Well, what do you do for a living?
- Take pictures.
- This sort?
No, Milly.
- On the house.
- Some house.
Hope it falls on his ruddy earhole.
It's your turn now, love.
It's her first time.
Come on, love.
Don't be shy.
He said you needn't photograph my face.
I want to.
Maybe you can fix my bruises too.
- I want to.
- What about the customers?
Don't be shy... of me.
It's my first time too.
Yours?
In front of eyes like...
Eyes as full of...
Twenty-one!
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Helen
Happy birthday to you
- Thank you.
- Come on, blow! One, two, three!
What's that?
- You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mmm.
I say. Look.
It's that chap from upstairs.
Hello. I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs, but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you, so, hello.
I'm Helen Stephens.
I'm having a party, and the other tenants are there and a few friends.
We'd like you to join us.
- I'm Mark.
- Pardon?
- I am Mark.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
Please come in. 
You'll meet the others who live here and...
Sorry, but... work.
Oh, well, 
I hope to keep it going for ages yet, so when you finish, why not look in...
- Mark?
- Come on, Helen. The cake. Everyone's waiting.
Hap- Happy birthday.
A minute.
Oh I... 
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I knew you wouldn't come down, so...
I brought you this.
Thank you... very much.
Well, I- I musn't keep you from your work.
- Oh, would you...
- Oh, thank you.
- I'd like to offer you a drink.
- Oh, thank you.
- I haven't got one.
- Oh, well, I'd adore some water.
You see, a hostess can't drink water at her own party.
It looks like a hint to the guests.
- There's milk if you'd like some.
- Oh, very much, if you can spare it.
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you very much.
This is a nice room, and is there another inside?
- Yes.
- How long have you lived here?
- Nearly all my life. I- I was born in this house.
- Oh?
- It's my father's.
- Do you mean at last I've found out who our landlord is?
Your father?
Well, no. He- He's dead.
I'm the landlord.
- You?
- Yes.
But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
- I haven't.
- Oh, I- I meant...
I know.
It's his house, and I'll never sell it.
But I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms.
If I charge you too much, please tell me, and I- I'll tell the agents.
The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others... or you'll have no peace.
- Peace.
- Mark, what do you do?
- Oh, thank you.
- Most of the time, I work in a film studio.
On the photographic side I'll bet.
- I hope to be a director very soon.
- Oh, how exciting.
When I came in, were you looking at some films?
- Yes.
- Of yours?
- Yes.
- I'd like to see them.
Oh, I know I'm being rude, but I really would like to see them.
It would be a birthday present from you to me.
- Would it?
- Mmm.
- Oh.
- But I'm- I'm sure you're too busy and...
Will you...
- Would you like to see them now?
- Oh, thank you.
I'll go first.
Oh, it's dark.
Is that better?
But it's enormous.
Oh. Terribly sorry.
- What are these?
- Chemicals.
Oh.
This is, well...
It's so many things, but... above all, it's so completely unexpected.
- These all yours?
- Yes.
I mean, did you do all this?
Mark, tell me about this room.
- It- It belonged to my father.
- Oh?
- What was he?
- A scientist.
Oh. Then this equipment was his?
No, I- I sold his to buy it.
- Sit down.
- Oh!
This all seems so, well, terribly technical.
If this is where you work,
I can't wait to see what you work at.
Mark?
- Don't know what to show you.
- Well, what were you looking at when I interrupted you?
All right.
Helen, this is the first 21st birthday present
I'll ever have given.
And it's the first I've ever asked for.
Thank you.
Mark, what a beautiful little boy.
- Who is he?
- Me.
Of course it is.
- Then who took this film?
- My father.
What a wonderful idea.
You'll be able to show it to your own chil...
Oh, you must've had a bad dream.
What was the light in your eye?
Camera, I suppose.
Whatever are you after?
Naughty boy.
I hope you were spanked.
Mark, what a strange thing for your father to photograph.
- Switch it off?
- No.
No.
Again?
Mark, this isn't some sort of a joke, is it?
No, Helen.
What's that?
- Mark, what are you doing?
- Wanted to photograph you watching.
No. No. 
Please help me to understand this thing.
That will do, Mark.
Dry your eyes and stop being silly.
All right now, Mark.
What was all that about?
That was a lizard, wasn't it, or a...
A li...
Well, how'd it get there, Mark?
How did it get there?
Was it a pet?
- Not mine.
- Won't you try to explain?
- You better go.
- I'd like to understand what I'm shown.
What was your father trying to do to you, photographing you at night?
You better go.
Mark, what's this?
I'm saying good-bye... to my... mother.
He photographed that?
Yes.
And this: her funeral.
And this: her burial.
- And this.
- Who's that?
Her successor.
Successor?
He married her six weeks after the... previous sequence.
She filmed what comes now.
It's out of focus.
Is that your father?
The morning he left for his honeymoon.
But what's he doing?
Giving me a present.
What is it?
Can't you guess?
The camera.
Switch it off, Mark!
Mark, switch it off!
Let's get out of here.
Mark?
So, he was a scientist?
What kind of a scientist, Mark?
- Biologist.
- What was he trying to do to you?
Mark, what was he trying to do to you?
Watch me grow up.
He wanted a record of a growing child, complete in every detail, if such a thing were possible.
And he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me at all times.
I never knew the whole of my childhood one moment's privacy.
And those lights in your eyes and that thing.
He was interested in the reactions... of the nervous system to... to fear.
Fear?
Fear.
Especially fear in children and how they react to it.
I think he learned a lot from me.
I'd wake up sometimes screaming.
He'd be there taking notes and pictures, and I'm sure good came of it... for some people.
- He was brilliant.
- A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed, and good comes of it?
Excuse me, but...
Oh, there you are, Helen.
The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if...
Oh, I'm coming.
I wish you'd join us.
Thank you.
Work.
I hope that you... have a sweet tooth.
Thank you for my present.
Good night, Mark.
Good night, old boy.
Cut!
Look, I tell you, Mr. Jarvis, this picture is a commercial proposition, and that's why I want you to do it because I know it's the type of thing you handle.
Look, you know I've talked to Johnnie already. 
I've talked to him, and he's crazy to do it.
These are the figures you wanted, Mr. Jarvis.
Oh, it's terrific, Mr. Jarvis.
This script is gonna...
- Still behind schedule.
- ... way back where it belongs.
And you know that Paramount want it.
Yeah. Paramount want it.
MGM want it. Columbia want it.
- But is it commercial?
- Anglo want it.
Send me a memo.
We'll discuss it next week.
Now, Miss Simpson, take a memo:
To all producers and directors.
In light of the new economy drive, if you can see it and hear it, the first take's okay.
Slate 99, take 49.
Clappers on end.
And darling, just this once, will you please make an effort to forget that you're stunning, and just try to look stunned?
One kind word and I would be.
All right.
Positions, everybody.
Cut.
Roll once again, please.
No, no, no, dear.
Cut. Cut. Cut it.
- Slate 99, take 53.
- We'll run it once more, please.
Cut it!
Once again, please.
If I have to faint once more,
I will faint.
- Slate 99, take 57.
- All right. Quiet, everybody.
All right. Action!
No, no, no, no, no. Cut it.
Cut it. Cut it. It's hopeless.
- Oh, miss.
- Cut!
Cut! How was it? Phil? Sam? Mark?
Print it!
Hold take one.
- Okay. Alex, that's it.
- All right, boys and girls. Wrap it up.
8:30 in the morning. 
You're wonderful, darling. You were really feeling it.
- Catching the bus?
- Not tonight. Meeting someone for a drink.
Oh. I wanted to discuss that film at the Everyman.
- Tomorrow then?
- I hope so.
- How's my favorite stand-in today, huh?
- Standing it.
8:30 in the morning.
Viv, how about having a drink with me on the way home?
I've got a date, Mr. Tate.
Good night, Miss Vivian.
Yeah, Sergeant, who's working late tonight then?
That Indian picture,
The Elephant with Two Tails.
- A bit crowded, aren't you?
- She'll take eight at a pinch.
- Which is what we'll probably get.
- Go on.
Well, I don't mind. 
Might as well get pinched in a car as squeezed in a bus.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark!
Well, are you there?
- Well, where are you?
- Here, Viv.
Oh, you frightened me.
Now listen.
They're working late on the lot.
I know. They've branched off this stage.
- We're using their power.
- We must call it off. They're bound to see us.
They might, but they won't interrupt us while we're filming.
- I've put the red light on.
- You've what?
- I've put the red light on. Would you...
- But...
Would you please stand over there?
But then they'll know someone's here.
- They won't come in.
- Well, they'll wait outside. What's the difference?
The difference is a perfect film.
I've waited a long time for this and so have you.
- No one must interrupt it.
- We'll be caught.
- What does that matter?
- Oh, matter!
- You stand to lose a job as an extra.
- Extra? Stand-in.
I stand to lose nothing.
The result must be so perfect... that the risks don't count.
So perfect... that even he... even he would say...
- Who's he? Don Jarvis?
- Hmm?
- Hmm.
- Oh, he'd say, "Sign on the dotted line, kiddies.
You can use my pen, but bring your own ink."
Well, if you're sure it's worth it.
It's time to find out, Viv.
Do you mind if I warm up?
Go ahead.
You belong there.
Oh, I do feel alone in front of it.
- I suppose stars never do.
- They feel alone without it.
And the great ones... feel alone all the time.
Then I'm great, boy.
What is it you want me to act?
Being frightened to death?
You remembered?
Yes, and I have a go.
- What are you doing?
- Building us a set.
Well, why don't you pull down the studio while you're about it?
They can only hang you once.
Exactly.
If only Don Jarvis could see me now.
If only I could see Don Jarvis now.
I warn you, Mark. I'm hysterical.
I'd rather act dying of laughter if it's all the same with you.
I'll be a little lovelier each day with fabulous pink.
- What are you doing?
- Be patient, Viv.
It's going to be worth it.
Oh, well. 
I've stood alone in front of a studio camera.
That's more than most have.
Ever stood behind one?
- No.
- Help yourself.
- Oh, I can see you, Mark. Perfectly.
- Good.
Yes, sir. 
I bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business.
Now what are you doing?
Photographing you photographing me.
Oh, Mark, you're brilliant.
Oh, I've lost you.
Ah, welcome, stranger.
- I've lost you again.
- Never mind.
I'm ready now, Viv.
Will you... go and stand on your cross, please?
Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir.
Am I supposed to imagine someone's gonna put me in there?
- Yes, Viv.
- Oh, Mark, I...
I hope I won't let you down.
I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me, but... well, I just don't feel frightened, that's all.
Oh, wouldn't it be better if I just did my number?
Later.
The trouble is I feel so relaxed.
That's due to you.
You're so at home with that camera, you make me feel at home too.
You have it in you, boy.
Ready, Viv?
Oh, well, I'll try.
What would frighten me to death?
Oh, set the mood for me, Mark.
Imagine... someone coming towards you... who wants to kill you... regardless of the consequences.
- A madman?
- Yes.
But he knows it, and you don't.
And just to kill you isn't enough for him.
- But how does that...
- Stay there, Viv.
You're just right.
But I can't imagine what you've thought of.
Imagine... this... would be one of his weapons.
That?
Yes.
- That.
- Mark.
Yes, that would be frightening.
There's something else.
Well, what is it?
That?
Mark.
Mark, no.
Take it away.
Take it away.
Mark!
Mark!
And that, darling, is the end of the news.
- Oh, unless you want the football results.
- Hm.
- What are you looking at?
- The ceiling.
- Wondering if that young man is home?
- Yes.
Well, he is.
I heard him come in four paragraphs ago.
He's late tonight.
- Do you like him?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Well, he has a quality.
I wish this had.
And I think he could help me with my book.
- Helen?
- Yes?
- Doesn't matter.
- Mother, what's worrying you?
- The price of whiskey.
- What else?
- What else matters?
- Don't you like Mark?
Haven't met him.
You don't like him.
Why not?
I don't trust a man who walks quietly.
Well, he's shy.
- His footsteps aren't. They're stealthy.
- Now, really, Mother.
- You going up to see him?
- May I?
We both have the key of the door.
Mine needs oiling.
- Yours needs exercise. Off you go.
- Thank you.
- Remember you lost the draw.
- Mm-hmm.
- Helen?
- Yes?
If you're back in five minutes,
I won't even finish this.
Done.
Who is it?
- It's Helen.
- Oh.
Come in, Helen.
Would you just wait in there?
Developing.
Mother heard you come in, so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed.
Are you sure this is convenient?
Won't be long!
I wish to express my gratitude to the following people... for their valuable contributions:
Professor A.D. Smith of New York University,
Mr. Edward Paton of the Belgravia Institute of Nervous Diseases... and Mark Lewis, my son.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
I- I hope you don't mind.
I'm sure I'm being a nuisance, but, Mark, I very much want to...
- Happy birthday.
- Mark, that's very sweet of you, but really.
It isn't much.
I- I don't know anything about...
21st birthday presents, but I saw it this morning, so...
- Please.
- Mark.
Thank you.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I liked it.
- More milk?
- More?
- Milk?
- Oh, no thank you.
I'm gonna put it on now.
There or... or there?
- Uh... first place.
- Yes, I think so too.
- Oh, I am keeping you.
- Oh. Oh, no.
I... I promise.
Mark, I'm here for some advice.
- F- From me?
- Please.
You see, I work in a public library in the children's section.
I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me.
- In my spare time, I write.
- What's embarr...
I write short stories for children, but so did Grimm, Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.
- Had any published? I'd like to read them.
- Some short stories.
I learned today that my first book has been accepted for publication in the spring.
- But... But Helen, th- that's wonderful.
- Yes.
- What is it about?
- A magic camera and what it photographs.
What... Whatever made you think of that?
I'll tell you one day.
I promise.
- W- What does it photograph?
- I'll tell you that too, but Mark, this is the problem.
The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes, but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and they suggest drawings.
- But you see, I don't agree.
- Oh, no. Nothing's impossible.
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that.
There must be photographs, however difficult to take,
- And Mark, I was wondering if...
- Oh, yes.
- You'll discuss it with me?
- Take them.
Well, I can't ask you to do that.
I mean, the publishers mightn't agree.
- I'd like to take them for you.
- But the money.
There are some things which I...
- Photograph for nothing.
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- Offend?
- Then you'll talk it over with me?
- When, please?
- That's up to you.
- Are you free tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- I hope I am.
- Well, I'll understand if you're not.
I'll try.
I'll try my hardest to be.
Thank you for listening... and for my present.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Looking for a trunk?
- Uh, yes. I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, Madam.
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
We must have some comedy in this scene.
- We'll retake it today.
- Very good, sir.
The thing about this scene is
I must have some comedy in it.
Now you do understand, darling, don't you? You see, that instead of taking the first trunk,
I want you to ask to see a red one.
And when he brings that,
I want you to look around...
- And ask... excuse me a second, darling...
- Sorry. for a white one, then when he brings the white one, then you ask for a different one... this one, the blue one.
And you, Michael, bring the trunks one by one, getting more and more fed up.
- I'll keep it light.
- I'm sure you will.
Then we'll end up on some sort of a gag 
I'll think of in a minute.
- Understand? What?
- I don't feel it.
- Don't feel it.
- Don't feel it, just do it!
- All right. Positions, everybody.
- Anyone seen Viv?
- Who?
- Oh, Diane's stand-in. I want to light the set.
- No, Phil. I want to run it first.
- All right, quiet.
All right. Ready? Action.
- Here we are, Madam.
- Oh, I'd like to see one in red.
Certainly, Madam.
Do you remember doing it?
Right. Ready for you, and back you go.
- Play for a close-up there.
- Um, do you have one in white?
Certainly, Madam.
There's a white one there behind you.
Right here. Again.
Good, Michael. 
Excellent.
All right.
Back again.
- Oh, um, do you have one in blue?
- Certainly, Madam.
That's it, and back you go.
That's it. 
Just take what you can without overdoing it.
Play it lightly, Michael.
Right. When it's in position, keep it tight, enter him there.
Very good.
The silly bitch.
She's fainted in the wrong scene.
- Excuse me, Chief?
- Mmm?
Um, we pass my place at the end of the bypass.
Do you mind if I drop in for a moment?
- To collect your kid's autograph book?
- That's it, Chief.
- If the nipper finds out where I've been...
- All right, Dawson.
Anything to help the sergeant.
It's about time the sergeant helped me. 
We're not getting anywhere with this Soho murder.
Well, what about that chap the landlady passed on the stairs?
She couldn't describe him except to say that he was carrying something she couldn't see.
- Oh, that's a help.
- Sergeant, I've been on the force 30 years, and I've never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's.
- What was it she saw?
- Well, surely, a man coming at her with a sharp weapon.
Mmm. I'm familiar with that kind of terror.
This is something new to me.
But what?
That's the one, sir.
- Chief, the expression. It's exactly...
- I know.
Don't say anything.
Well, sir, we shall probably have to interview everyone, so we better plan a campaign that won't interfere too much with your productions.
Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.
If you knew what even a single day's delay could cost.
Oh, uh, we do, sir.
- Hello, Mark.
- Hello.
- Hey, I don't think you ought to do that.
- Sorry, sir.
- Do what?
- Make me famous. Some chap's giving me a screen test.
Gerry, you're next. 
Don't look so scared. They can't eat you.
Looks as though it's going to be an early night tonight.
- I've been watching you.
- Oh.
- Have you been filming those policemen?
- Hmm.
I have a few quite interesting shots of them.
- It's a chance I never expected.
- Chance for what?
To photograph an investigation... or as much of it as I can get.
What on Earth for?
It will complete a documentary.
- Documentary, huh? What's it about?
- Mmm.
- Hmm?
- What's it about?
I'd rather not tell you till it's finished, and it will be soon.
- Suppose they catch you?
- Oh, they will. They look very efficient.
- Don't you mind?
- No.
- Mark, are you crazy?
- Yes.
Do you think they'll notice?
- Mark, you're next.
- Don't get into trouble for heaven's sake.
I want to discuss that film at the Everyman.
Oh, yes, I'd like that.
Come in!
Mr. Lewis?
Ah, my photographer.
I brought you the camera in case you wanted to take the film away.
- Chief?
- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.
As long as we don't appear at the local next week in place of the cartoon.
I'm Chief Inspector Gregg.
This is Sergeant Miller.
Grab a chair.
Well, now, have you anything to tell us?
- I don't think so, sir.
- Did you know the girl?
- Yes, sir.
- How well?
- Mainly by sight.
- Mm-hmm.
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.
- Did you speak to her?
- I called out good night.
Don't know if she heard me.
- What'd you do then?
- Oh, taking some shots.
I'm making a film.
- Oh? Where?
- Oh, all over the place.
It's a documentary.
Mm-hmm.
Anyone with you?
No, sir. 
Just my... Just my camera.
Sergeant Miller.
Right. I'll tell him.
The doctor's finished his examination, and he wants to see you.
- Right. You'd better go on first.
- Right, sir.
Got ya.
- Nice job.
- Thank you, sir.
What time did you arrive home last night, 
Mr. Lewis?
About 10:00, 10:30.
- Anyone see you?
- Yes. The people who live downstairs.
I see.
Right. That's all.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.
Wait a minute!
Direct me to that set of yours, would you?
I'd probably end up on location.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
I warned him.
Well, I think I can find my way now.
Thanks for the escort.
- No doubt at all. Wounds caused by the same instrument.
- Mm-hmm.
Both women subjected to the most violent shock.
- What sort of shock?
- Up to you to find out, Inspector.
Not my department.
- Can we move the body?
- Yes. I- I have finished.
That's all fellows.
Hello.
What's this she's lying on?
- Oh, a tape recorder.
- Give me a handkerchief.
Baxter!
Get it tested for fingerprints.
- Get all the reels played back.
- Right.
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet!
I taught I heard a putty tat.
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands.
And if we don't get him quickly, there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the commissioner.
So let's hurry things up.
Shall we?
"She was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film...
The Walls Are Closing In, starring Pauline Shields.
A spokesman at the studio said that her performance in the film showed such promise... that her role was to have been built up."
- Oh, the prime minister...
- Mark is in films, isn't he?
- Yes, darling. "Sir Lav..."
- I wonder if he knew her.
- I'll ask him tonight.
- Oh. Is he taking you out?
- Yes, if he's free.
- Hmm. That's very chivalrous of him.
- Where is he taking you?
- I have no idea, and I don't suppose he has.
Which studio does he work at?
- I don't know. I'll ask him.
- If he's free.
Shall I bring him in and introduce you?
- I feel as if I know him.
- Now, darling.
He's here.
Why don't we make him a present of that window?
He practically lives there.
How did you know he was there?
The back of my neck told me.
The part that I talk out of.
Hello.
- Free? Good. So am I.
- Yes.
I'd like you to come in for a moment and meet my mother.
Yes, please.
Darling, this is Mark.
H- How do you do, Mrs. Stephens?
Hello, Mark.
Have you been running, young man?
Yes. Didn't want to be late for Helen.
Thank you.
You deserve a drink for that.
- What would you like?
- Uh, nothing. Thank you very much.
- Hmm. Tell me, young man,
- Mother, I've left your supper... which studio do you work at?
Chipperfield Studio.
That poor girl, where did she work?
- Brookwood, I think.
- Hmm.
We were wondering if you knew her.
No.
No.
I didn't know her.
Pity.
I do like firsthand information.
Darling, may I tell you about your supper?
No.
Go and be told about yours.
Good-bye, Mark.
I expect we shall meet again.
I hope so, Mrs. Stephens.
Mother, we forgot to cut the cards.
Your supper's laid out in the kitchen.
If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it.
- We'll be early. Bye, darling.
- Night.
- Mark, I want to ask you something rather personal.
- Yes?
- How long is it since you've gone out without that?
- Without what?
That camera.
Oh. I... I don't think I know.
Exactly. I don't think
I've ever seen you without it.
But are you going to need it tonight?
Well, are you?
And if so, shall I bring some work with me too?
- I'm not going to need it tonight.
- Good, then give it to me.
- Well, I'll put it away for you. It'll be quite safe.
- No.
Then take it upstairs if you can't trust me with it.
I trust you.
Then let's put it in here.
Come in and see for yourself.
We'll put it in there and lock it.
This was my... my mother's room.
- Was it, Mark?
- Hmm.
I am being tactless, aren't I?
It's just that I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and I...
But bring it with you, if you want to.
- You.
- Thank you.
- I feel...
- Yes?
I can't describe it.
Could only photograph it.
- Shall I tell you what I feel? Famished!
- Hmm. Good.
I know a small place around the corner.
- It's awfully good on Christmas Day.
- Is it?
- Yes. There aren't too many open then.
- No.
Sounds fun.
- Helen?
- Yes?
Come on.
This way.
- What does your magic camera photograph?
- People.
It's owned by a little boy, and it sees grown-ups as they were when they were children.
I was hoping you'd be able to when you were...
Where is this restaurant?
- Around the corner.
- Come along then.
Thank you.
There isn't a single face in the crowd that doesn't look like a child.
- Don't say that.
- If you catch it at the right moment.
Oh, Helen. 
I would like to find those faces for you, with you.
Well, let's try.
Oh. Mother must have gone to bed.
- Oh, Mark... it was a wonderful evening.
- Eh...
That's what I was going to say.
It was a wonderful evening.
And you made it wonderful... without your camera.
I'll get it for you.
It's still here, you're magic camera.
I wonder how this sees grown-ups.
- Me, for instance. Now that I am one.
- Not you.
Why not?
- It will never see you.
- Mark.
Whatever I photograph,
I always lose.
I don't understand.
Oh, he'll wake Mother.
Thank you again for my evening.
Will you go to bed now, and not stop up watching those films?
Well, I...
I've got some work to do.
Then I'll go to bed, and try to find your faces.
Faces which I...
Faces which...
- Good evening, Mark.
- How did you...
The young man bathing himself brought me to your door.
I managed the rest of the adventure alone.
This is one room
I expected to find locked.
I was never allowed keys.
Can't get used to them.
I brought her home early.
Thank you.
- Is there something you...
- A talk.
- Next door would be more...
- I...
I feel at home here.
I- I visit this room every night.
Visit?
The blind always live in the rooms they live under.
Every night you switch on that film machine.
What are these films you can't wait to look at?
What's the film you're showing now?
Why don't you lie to me?
- I'd never know.
- You would know at once.
- Take me to your cinema.
- Yes.
What am I seeing, Mark?
Why don't you answer?
Oh!
It's no good.
I was afraid it wouldn't be.
- What?
- The lights fade too soon.
- They always do.
- I...
I have to try again.
What do you think you've spoiled?
Opportunity.
Now I have to find another one.
What are you doing?
Mark?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Why are you putting that light on my face?
Mark?
Please let me finish.
It's for Helen.
What do you mean, "It's for Helen"?
She wanted to see something I photographed.
My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs.
Please, don't- don't be frightened.
Not frightened.
Hot.
So put that camera away!
Yes.
In rather a hurry, aren't you?
Must be tired.
It's late.
You...
You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.
I- I won't be selfish.
You- You can take some more pictures, if you want to.
No, thank you.
Why not?
I ran out of film.
Can't you find some more to please Helen?
No. No.
You... 
You don't trust yourself... to take any more, do you?
Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it, Mark?
A pity it can't be photographed.
If I'd listened to it years ago, I...
I might have kept my sight.
I wouldn't have let a man operate 
I had no faith in.
So, I'm listening to my instinct now.
And it says all this filming isn't healthy, and that you need help.
Get it, Mark.
Get it quickly.
And until you do, 
I don't want you and Helen to see each other.
I will never photograph her,
I promise you.
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark.
And if you don't listen to me, one of us will move from this house.
It would be a pity, because we'll never find a cheaper place.
You'll never have to move because of me.
I... I promise.
Good boy.
The stairs are the difficult part.
That's far enough.
Thank you.
Taking my picture?
Yes.
It's a long time since anyone did.
Mark, what's troubling you?
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
You'll have to tell someone.
You'll have to!
Now over here.
Swing over on me. Good.
All right. Here we go. 
First positions, everybody. Absolute quiet.
- Ready to turn, Phil?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Hey! That sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist.
Heard it on the grapevine.
All right, boys and girls.
First positions, everybody.
Now, take it easy, and I know you'll be absolutely wonderful, darling.
- It's simply just... Do you mind standing...
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Who is this, Alex?
- It's the detective, sir.
Oh- Oh, yes. Of course it is. 
Everybody's here just to help you, darling.
Now, take it easy.
It's exactly the same as it was before, only one or two slight changes.
This time it's hats instead of... of, um, of trunks.
- You will help, Michael, won't you? You know.
- Yes, sir.
Now, darling, be very brave. 
You're wonderful, and we shall all be with you.
- Just as... Oh, please!
- All right. Clear the set! Please, makeup.
- Now, take it easy, darling. Just relax.
- All right.
All right.
And camera!
Hat, madam?
Yes. I- I'd like to see that one.
Certainly, madam.
Thank you.
Oh.
Uh, have you one in red?
Certainly, madam.
In red? In red?
Have you one in blue?
In blue. In blue.
Ye gods!
- Break for half an hour, sir?
- No. Break forever!
All right, boys and girls.
Break it up. Back in half an hour.
Hmm?
Yes.
- Could you, uh, suggest something?
- Oh, it's jolly interesting.
No. I mean to help her... psychologically.
Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.
Half an hour is useless.
Yes.
Thanks very much.
Psst!
What's your job?
I'm... a focus puller.
Oh. So am I, in a way.
- I wonder...
- Hmm?
I wonder if you knew my father, 
Professor Lewis?
- A...
- A. N. Lewis.
Oh, of course I knew him.
He lectured to me.
An extraordinary man.
Brilliant!
Quite brilliant!
Do you know what he was interested in... before he died?
No. Tell me.
Tell me.
I- I don't remember what he called it, but it has something to do with what... what causes people to be Peeping Toms.
Scoptophilia, that would interest him.
Most fertile mind.
- Scopto...
- Philia. The morbid urge to gaze.
Coined since his day. 
Now tell me, are there any of his manuscripts left?
- I thought it could be cured.
- Usually. Yeah.
- Now about his manuscripts.
- Quickly.
The cure. Oh, very quick. 
A couple of years' analysis three times a week, an hour a time and soon it's uprooted.
Now, are there any of his papers left?
I should be most grateful if I could see them.
I- I'll give you my address.
Yes, Doctor.
- I wonder what all that's about?
- I don't know.
We'll find out afterwards.
Hey, Mark.
Can't wait to show you this.
I should charge ya.
You don't get that in Sight and Sound.
Oh, she's terrific.
I got some more, if you're interested.
You've given me... an idea.
Hey, I'll bet I have.
He asked me if I knew his father, which I did.
- Brilliant man.
- Is that all he wanted?
I think so. 
Oh, we had a little chat about scoptophilia.
- And he's going to... Voyeurism.
- About what?
- Eh?
- What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, and...
Peeping Tom?
Interesting boy.
He has his father's eyes.
You don't suspect him, do you?
I suspect them all.
- Action!
- What about you?
I'm interested in this fantastic extrovert who brought the girl in.
There's something on his mind.
No wonder.
He's the director.
Can't manage Saturday, sir.
But... 
But they're letting us off early today.
This afternoon after work... might be my only chance.
Well, uh, be here at 6:00, Mark.
I'll have Milly waiting.
- On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.
- I'll be there.
- You'd better be.
- The last shot of the day. Make it a good one.
- Okay.
- You got your list, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
I want to see how some of them spend their spare time.
- Which ones?
- Exactly, Sergeant.
- Oh, there you are. Now, don't make a habit of this.
- I won't, sir.
- Milly's upstairs.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, I've got to go out.
If you finish before I'm back,
Lock up and put this through the letter box.
What are you looking at?
Haven't you seen a key before?
The till will be empty, if that's what you're smiling about.
Now, remember what I said.
No more of this fancy stuff.
You've spoiled my whole evening, you have.
- And I had a date with my new boyfriend.
- Sorry, Milly.
Well, what's the idea?
I may not be here tomorrow.
Why? Going on maneuvers with the Boy Scouts? 
Now what are you doing?
- I thought so.
- Come on. We haven't got all night.
There's all that nude stuff on the bed to finish.
Well, of all the...
Have you gone completely crazy?
I'm just completing a documentary.
You're a documentary and a half, you are.
I didn't stand up my gentleman friend... and come back here and take my clothes off for you to start filming the street.
I might as well talk to a zombie.
Is it safe to be alone with you, I wonder?
Might be more fun if it wasn't.
Drive straight on.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Tony.
- Where are you going? You...
- To leave something for Mark.
- You haven't much time for me these days.
- Oh, Tony, I...
It's all right.
I'll be here if you want me.
Oh, by the way, your mother was yelling out before you came in.
Something about Mark photographing her.
Photographing Mother?
You must be mistaken.
- Of course. Uh, see you sometime.
- Yeah.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark.
I don't know what to make of it, sir.
He went to a public library, and then to a newsagent's shop.
For private photography, if you ask me.
Shall I hang around outside the house, sir?
No. I don't think so either.
All right, sir. 
I'll give you the details when I get back. Bye, sir.
Don't let me see you are frightened.
- So, leave. Hurry up!
- No!
Leave!
Not till I know.
- Now.
- That film...
That film is... just a film, isn't it?
It's horrible.
Horrible. 
But it's just a film, isn't it?
No.
No.
I killed them.
You'll be safe, as long as I can't see you frightened.
So stand in the shadows, please.
Please.
Inspector Gregg.
What?
Put him on the line.
Peters here. Yes. 
I went upstairs to look around, and I found her lying.
What's the address?
Newsagent's shop!
Your mother is right.
Must tell someone everything.
Sorry it has to be you.
This was his workshop.
And you know some of what he did, but not all.
Aged five.
Aged seven.
All the rooms were wired for sound, and they still are.
Your room.
- Happy birthday.
- Here. Open this one.
Your mother's.
- Tony's.
- No one will come in, honestly, darling.
- I don't care.
- But, darling.
- Tony, stop it!
- The door is locked.
I don't care. I'm scared.
Turn it off.
- Look at me, Mark.
- Not if you're frightened.
Look at me!
What did you do to those girls?
- No.
- What did you do?
If you want to torment me for the rest of my life, then make me imagine.
What did you do to those girls?
I... I can't.
Show me.
But if you're frightened...
Show me, or I'll remain frightened for the rest of my life.
Show me!
Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is?
It's fear.
So I did something very simple.
Very simple.
When they felt the spike... touching their throat, and knew I was going to kill them,
I made them watch their own deaths.
I made them see... their own terror as the spike went in.
And if death has a face, they saw that too.
But not you.
I promised I'd never photograph you.
Not you.
Frightened for you.
- Got the men all right?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, let's go.
- Look out!
- It's only a camera.
- Only?
- Give yourself up, Mark!
- I've been ready for this for such a long time.
- What are you doing?
- That's all right.
All right. He's there!
All right. Come on, then!
I can beat that.
Give yourself up, Mark!
Watch them, Helen.
Watch them say good-bye.
One by one.
I've timed it so often.
I wish I could have found your faces for you.
Helen! Helen!
I'm afraid.
No. No. Mark.
And I'm glad I'm afraid.
Girl's alive.
Go get an ambulance.
All right.
All right. Don't be a silly boy.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Good night, Daddy. Hold my hand.
Yes.
Yes, I think I can start painting in the morning.
I think you're one of the most selfish men I've ever met.
Dedicated.
Are you going to marry me?
I've told you. Yes.
As soon as I've got rid of a few debts and some money in the bank.
- Bruno.
- Oh, now, for heaven's sake.
- We can't wait any longer, Bruno.
- Why not?
Because I...
Well, tell me, tell me.
Oh, come on now, it's not as bad as all that.
- Just tell me why you have to get ma...
- I just do.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on now, what's happening to you?
Tell me.
I'm going to have your baby.
That's what's happened.
When did you know?
A week ago.
- Where are you going?
- To see your father.
- Why?
- I'm not going to evade my obligations.
I want him to know that.
Your obligations?
Yes, I'm afraid that's how he'll look at it.
Bruno!
Don't go to him, Bruno.
Bruno, wait.
- Well?
- He'll kill you if you go to him.
I doubt it.
Oh, Bruno!
Bruno!
What is it, Carla?
They're bringing the body in now, Doctor.
- I want it in here.
- Very well.
And Inspector Kanof is waiting to see you.
Thank you.
Well?
The girl is the daughter of Janus Cass, landlord of the Saracen Inn.
This may not be the same as the others.
- You mean you hope it isn't.
- Naturally.
Seven unsolved murders in five years is hardly good for my prestige here in Vandorf.
You think the young man did it?
Lovers sometimes quarrel.
He's still missing.
The young man's name is Bruno Heitz.
He comes to Vandorf every year, and rents the old mill house by the forest.
He's an artist, son of Professor Jules Heitz at Berlin University.
- Doctor of Literature.
- I know him.
We were students together.
- You'll be getting in touch with him?
- Immediately, Doctor.
I suggest not immediately.
Wait until they find the young man.
As you say, Doctor.
Thank you, Ratoff.
Wait here.
Madam.
Ratoff.
- How did this happen?
- She pounced on me, Doctor.
- As soon as I got through the door of her cell.
- This is the second time.
- Put her in a straitjacket, and keep her in it.
- Right.
- Sister, get those cuts attended to.
- Yes, Doctor.
What's the matter?
Doctor, you'll perform an autopsy?
On a body that's turned to stone?
Inspector.
Listen.
They've picked up the scent.
We're getting too close to the castle for my liking.
- Afraid?
- Yes, I am. I don't mind admitting it.
There are 20 men within a radius of a quarter of a mile.
You've got a gun, use it if you have to.
But remember, I want the boy taken alive.
Continue, Inspector.
When I broke the news of the girl's death to her father, he said it was no surprise to him.
What did you deduce from that?
That he knew of Bruno Heitz's bad reputation.
Which you, personally, had experienced?
Yes, sir. There were certain incidents.
- Describe them, please.
- Drunkenness.
- Bad behaviour in public.
- Thank you.
- Call Janus Cass.
- Janus Cass.
Mr Cass, you are the father of the deceased girl, Sascha?
Yes, sir.
- And the landlord of the Saracen Inn?
- Yes, sir.
Would you please tell the court what you know of the relationship between your daughter and this young man?
My girl loved him, unfortunately.
He took advantage of her and didn't want to face the consequences.
When you say "took advantage of her", do you mean she was pregnant by him?
Yes, sir. He was a thoroughly bad lot.
I told Sascha to have nothing to do with him.
- But she disobeyed you.
- I'm afraid so.
Did you personally observe this man's addiction to alcohol?
Well, sir, he came frequently to the Saracen Inn.
And in his cups, a tendency to violence?
- Well, sir, I...
- Thank you, Mr Cass.
You may stand down.
- Call Dr. Namaroff.
- Dr. Namaroff.
Now, Doctor, will you tell us what, in your opinion, was the cause of this girl's death?
Her death was undoubtedly the result of violence.
I observed deep abrasions around the forehead, and there were indentations in the skull, which may have been caused by some metal instrument.
Thank you, Doctor.
Call Professor Heitz.
Professor Heitz.
You are Professor Jules Heitz,
- father of the deceased man, Bruno Heitz?
- I am.
- You've heard the evidence before this court?
- I have.
- Did you know the girl?
- No, sir.
From the evidence I've heard,
I have the impression that your son was somewhat of a bohemian.
- Would you agree with that?
- He was a talented artist.
His life was of his own choosing.
I also have the impression he was a libertine.
No.
He had a number of girlfriends.
Possibly. However, that does not make him a libertine.
And one girlfriend in particular whom he betrayed?
I cannot believe that.
You are his father.
- Have you anything you wish to add?
- Yes.
I read the newspapers, and I am also a student of human nature.
I have read about the unsolved Vandorf murders.
I have also listened to the evidence and opinions given in this court.
In my opinion, everything I have heard has been generated by fear.
Proceed.
Evidence so obviously circumstantial, prejudiced and contrived, making one innocent man a scapegoat.
So obviously, indeed, that I can forecast your verdict now:
Murder and suicide.
My son's innocence stained to bring this witch-hunt to a smug and satisfactory close.
That is all I have to say, Mr Coroner.
But, believe me,
I shall not rest until I have cleared my son's good name.
If you have finished, you may stand down.
I find that the dead woman was murdered by her fiancé, Bruno Heitz, who then, in a fit of remorse took his own life.
Court is adjourned.
There have been seven murders committed in the forest of Vandorf in the past five years.
Every victim bore the same marks.
Each body turned to stone.
Why didn't you speak of this at the inquest?
Why is everyone in Vandorf trying to evade the truth?
- Including you?
- Carla.
I expected Kanof to make a scapegoat of that poor innocent boy, but not you.
Why are you so certain he's innocent?
Because she has come back.
She's here.
Somewhere.
In this hospital. I know it.
Come in.
Professor Heitz would like to see you, sir.
Show him in.
Professor, this is my assistant,
Miss Carla Hoffman.
How do you do?
That'll be all, Miss Hoffman.
I shan't need you any more today.
I'm so very sorry about your son, Professor.
You have my deepest sympathy.
- Thank you.
- Do sit down.
No, thank you.
I want to ask you a simple question.
Please.
You were once a guest at my house in Berlin.
You met both my sons, Bruno in particular.
- You talked to him at some length.
- I believe I did.
What impression did you form of him?
Well, I thought he was...
Normal?
Why, yes, of course.
Yet capable of murder?
My dear Heitz, that is hardly a fair question.
Given a certain set of circumstances,
I believe almost everybody is capable of murder.
Naturally, you are prejudiced.
I have been in Vandorf exactly two days.
I have asked questions and received evasion.
I have called at police headquarters and been refused admittance.
Everywhere I go
I find a conspiracy of silence.
Oh, I'm sure you exaggerate.
Oh no, there's an explanation somewhere.
It lies in the past.
Some horrible occurrence, which has been suppressed.
To the people of Vandorf, this thing, whatever it is, is real.
Something they cannot mention, because they dare not.
They want to believe that it doesn't exist, because the very admission of its existence only increases their fear.
That's why my son was branded a murderer.
He at least was human, tangible.
Doctor,
I need your help.
I can add nothing to what I said in court.
Let me ask you one more question.
Have you ever heard of Megaera?
- Megaera?
- She was one of three sisters.
They were known as Gorgons.
Two of them were slain.
According to the legend, the third, Megaera, fled to these parts.
It's said that when mortals looked upon her face, they were turned to stone.
That legend is 2,000 years old.
So I believe.
We are men of science.
I don't believe in ghosts or evil spirits, and I don't think you do either.
That's one of the most unscientific remarks I have ever heard.
I believe in the existence of everything which the human brain is unable to disprove.
Or prove?
That is why I'm remaining in Vandorf.
At least I intend to prove that my son was not a murderer.
One moment.
A word of advice.
What is it?
Leave Vandorf before it's too late.
What is it you're afraid of?
- I'm afraid for you.
- Or of what I may discover if I remain?
Let's get to the house!
Come on, let's get him out!
Get out of Vandorf, Heitz!
- Go home, Heitz.
- Sir, don't you think we should...
We want you out of this house, mister, now.
Get out of my house, all of you.
Oh, so that's how it is.
Police!
Come on.
I hope you're not too badly hurt.
No.
If there is a repetition of this,
Inspector, I shall hold you responsible.
I'm sorry. My police force is very small.
We have other duties besides giving protection to unwelcome visitors.
Your business here is over. Why don't you go?
My business is not over.
Very well.
I've warned you.
That's the best I can do.
If you should change your mind, Professor,
I'll see you have safe conduct to the station.
I want you to send a telegram to Professor Meister at Leipzig University.
Come in.
Oh, Paul, this telegram has just arrived.
It's from your father. He wants you to go to Vandorf immediately.
This is the first I've heard of my father since Bruno was reported missing.
You'd better go, hadn't you?
There's a train that leaves at nine in the morning, I believe it is.
Yes, sir.
Hope you find everything all right.
Let me know if you want any help.
Oh, and give my regards to your father, won't you?
Yes, thank you, sir. Yes, I will.
Hans!
Hans!
- What's happened, sir?
- For God's sake, don't come nearer.
Your face.
Listen carefully.
I haven't much time, Hans.
I have to write a letter to my son, Paul.
He should be here tomorrow.
In the morning, take the letter and give it to him.
No one else must see it but Paul.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.
Leave me now.
There is nothing you can do.
Goodbye, Hans.
Yes, you may see a copy of the death certificate if you wish.
But as far as the body is concerned, that is entirely up to the police.
They have refused permission for me to see the body.
- Why?
- This is a police state, Mr Heitz.
They don't have to give reasons.
- Doctor, did you examine the body?
- Of course.
And in your opinion, there was no doubt as to the cause of death? Heart failure?
No doubt whatsoever.
Then how do you account for this?
"I am agonised by pains in my chest.
I am turning to stone."
- May I see that letter?
- I'm sorry.
My father gave instructions that I was to show it to no one.
- I see.
- He knew he was dying when he started to write.
He was able to write three pages.
Now that doesn't sound like heart failure.
You don't go on working through a heart attack.
You know that as well as I.
He refers to "this terrible thing
"stalking amongst the people of Vandorf.
"It turned Sascha to stone and others before her,
"The conspiracy of silence and the fear."
And he mentions "Megaera".
Does the name mean anything to you,
Dr. Namaroff?
You're not suggesting there's any connection between a character from mythology and your father's death?
When he wrote this letter, he knew what was happening to him.
He knew how he was dying and why.
It wasn't heart failure.
That is your opinion.
No doubt you'll have an opportunity to express it at the inquest.
When will it be held?
I don't know.
But I'll see that you're informed.
Goodbye, Mr Heitz.
Please forgive me for intruding.
The door was open.
Who are you?
I'm Carla Hoffman.
Dr. Namaroff's assistant at the hospital.
You are Paul Heitz.
Can I help you?
I would like to help you if I can.
Does Namaroff know you're here?
He'd be very angry if he did.
Oh, please believe me,
I only came here to see if I can help you.
This afternoon, you spoke to Dr. Namaroff?
- You spoke about Megaera?
- Yes.
Did Dr. Namaroff tell you that the spirit of Megaera roams this forest and it has also been known to enter this house?
No, he didn't.
For the simple reason that he doesn't believe in it. Or says he doesn't.
- But you do.
- I don't know.
I only know that something very terrible is happening here in Vandorf.
Megaera does exist, Mr Heitz.
- Have you seen her?
- No one has seen her and lived.
Do you really think that
Namaroff believes in her?
- I know he does.
- Well, then why doesn't he admit it?
Because he's like all the rest.
He tries to deny the existence of something he cannot explain.
Megaera is inexplicable and terrifying.
But you must believe in her.
If you don't, you'll see no reason to leave here.
And one day, you'll...
You'll be found like all the others.
Well, thank you for warning me.
But I have to find out things for myself.
I can't leave.
In less than one week,
I've lost my brother and my father.
I'm not really very concerned about what happens to me.
I am concerned.
Thank you.
I'm very grateful to you.
I must go now. I'm on duty in half an hour.
Goodbye.
I hope we'll meet again.
"Herbert Spencer once said that every legend and myth known to mankind
"is not entirely without its authentic foundation.
"Presupposing he is right,
"we must go to the very source of this legend,
"to a time over 2,000 years ago, to Ancient Greece."
There were three hideous monsters.
Sisters.
They were called Gorgons.
Their names were Tisiphone,
Medusa and Megaera.
Their heads were crowned with living snakes, and each snake was a tentacle of the hellish brain from which it sprang.
So hideous was the Gorgon, that anyone who looked upon her was petrified.
The proper word is "gorgonised" which literally means "turned to stone".
Go on.
I'm sorry.
He came in just then.
That's all I had time to memorise.
I want you to trust me, Carla.
Why is this letter so important?
Because Professor Heitz was a great student of mythology, and, had he lived, he could have provided a complete answer.
I had hoped to find it in that letter.
Has it helped you at all?
A little.
I can tell you that...
That devil. She's out.
Look for her. Don't come back till you've found her.
- If I do find her, I'll kill her.
- Ratoff!
You'll bring her back alive.
I was about to tell you that Megaera has taken on human form.
Human?
Don't try to talk.
Everything's all right.
Ratoff.
- Where is Dr. Namaroff?
- He's in the laboratory.
Would you ask him to come here, please?
Miss Hoffman would like you to go to Mr Heitz's ward.
Very well.
Ratoff.
Yes, sir?
You said she was not quite dead when you found her?
Not quite.
She had enough strength left to spit in my face.
And then she died.
Thank you.
What happened to me?
Miss Hoffman had some sort of presentiment that something was going to happen to you.
We found you lying beside the pool in your garden.
How long have I been here?
Five days.
- Five...
- Lie still.
Can you remember what happened before you fell?
Fell?
Don't you remember?
I remember...
I remember seeing something reflected in the pool.
What was it?
A face.
It was horrible.
It was the most horrible thing
I've ever seen.
You must rest now.
I'll talk to you again in a day or two.
- In a day or two?
- You're in a very weak condition.
I don't want you to overtax your strength.
For pity's sake, I must know about this...
This thing!
- Whatever it was.
- I'm speaking to you as a doctor.
You're suffering from shock.
It's essential that you should rest.
I tell you I'm all right. Please.
I've got to know.
I want you to look at yourself.
Now please do as I tell you.
It's all right. It's all right.
She was here. She came into the room. I saw her.
You were dreaming.
No one's been here, I promise you.
She was leaning over me. I could see the snakes' heads lunging forward.
I tell you, she was here.
It was a dream. It was only a dream.
Try and rest.
Try and rest.
Mr Heitz is ready to leave.
He'd like to see you before he goes.
Ask him to come in.
Mr Heitz.
Sit down, Mr Heitz.
I understand that the inquest on my father was held a week ago.
Yes. He was buried the day after you were taken ill.
Miss Hoffman took the liberty of sending a wreath on your behalf.
I'm very grateful to her.
You'll be leaving for Leipzig now?
No.
- Are you staying in Vandorf?
- I'm going back to the house.
Doctor, I think you would like to unravel this mystery as much as I.
- Why can't we work together?
- I don't understand you. What mystery?
Oh, for Heaven's sake! Don't treat me like one of your neurotic patients.
You know perfectly well what I'm talking about.
I'm afraid I don't.
- Good day, Mr Heitz. Good day.
- But, Doctor...
You're afraid of her like the rest of them, aren't you?
Well, I intend to find this creature.
- Indeed?
- And destroy it.
Come to my office, will you?
- Yes, sir?
- There's a full moon tonight.
Don't let her out of your sight.
I feel I have the right to ask you a question.
What is it?
Is she in danger?
She may be close to death.
Somehow I knew you'd be here.
Why did Namaroff issue a false death certificate?
Who is he trying to shield?
I know it's almost beyond belief, but there's the evidence in that coffin.
A man who looked on her face and was turned to stone.
Herbert Spencer once said that every legend and myth known to mankind is not without its authentic foundation.
You've read my father's letter.
Yes.
I lied to you.
Dr. Namaroff wanted that letter.
I memorised part of it.
Why did he want it?
He was hoping it would throw a new light on Megaera.
Please don't hate me for this.
Why? Why are you telling me this now?
I'm afraid.
- Of Namaroff?
- Yes.
In a way.
But why?
Well, go on. Tell me.
You asked me just now who he's trying to shield.
I don't know.
He won't tell me.
Is Namaroff in love with you?
And jealous?
Yes.
Then why don't you leave him?
I wish I could.
Carla?
I'll take you away with me now.
- Paul, I can't leave.
- Please don't be afraid.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- Then leave Namaroff.
- I can't, Paul. I just can't.
- But why, if you love me? Why not?
- I don't know.
- I don't know why.
- Carla.
Paul.
Please, don't ask me again.
Well, do you propose to keep me standing out here all night?
Professor Meister.
Oh, I can't tell you how glad I am to see you.
Good heavens, Paul.
What's happened to you?
Well, I've been ill.
Ill?
You look as if you've been in your grave and dug your way out.
- Where have you been?
- Here, in Vandorf.
I hadn't seen you for some considerable time, so I thought I'd come and see what you'd been doing.
It's a long story.
I've come a long way to hear it.
Could I offer you some refreshment? Coffee?
No, nothing like that, thank you.
I ate on the train.
Now, tell me your story.
Were you out tonight, Carla?
Yes.
Where did you go?
For a walk.
Were you alone?
Yes.
It isn't a pretty sight.
It never ceases to amaze me why the most noble work of God, the human brain, is the most revolting to the human eye.
Do you remember when we found Paul Heitz?
I do.
It was the night Martha escaped, and you told me that Megaera had taken on human form.
Well?
Was it Martha?
No, Carla, it wasn't Martha.
You suspect somebody.
It's too early to say.
We work so closely together.
I have a right to know.
Please tell me.
Not until I'm sure.
Good night, Carla.
So you only saw her reflection?
It was enough.
When Perseus beheaded Medusa, he guided his blow by looking at her reflection in the shield that he carried.
If your story is true, the girl, Sascha, must have looked directly at the
Gorgon and so did your father.
What spared you is the fact that you only saw her reflection.
- This much we know.
- Then you believe me?
I'm not saying that Megaera exists.
Unquestionably, you saw something.
Hallucination or not, it was certainly real enough to you.
- She was not a hallucination.
- No, of course not.
Oh, Professor, please don't try to humour me.
Is the idea of Megaera any stranger than the theory of reincarnation, which admits to a dead person's spirit inhabiting a human body?
Probably not, Paul, but that particular theory has yet to be proved.
- Do you believe it?
- I neither believe it nor disbelieve it.
Now, as to your own story, let us start with the assumption that Megaera, in some form or another, has indeed returned.
Have you met many people since you've been here?
Very few.
Any women?
- Only the one I told you about.
- Oh, yes, Carla. Carla...
Hoffman.
What's she like?
Very beautiful.
I see.
You're in love with her?
- I didn't say so.
- You didn't have to.
I'll have that drink you offered me now.
Under no circumstances will I permit such a thing. There is no precedent.
Don't use long words, Inspector.
They don't suit you.
If you don't wish to be of assistance, that's entirely your affair. I'll go higher up.
- Higher up?
- I presume that even you, Inspector, acknowledge the existence of a superior?
- How dare you?
- The Foreign Secretary, for example.
- I would like to point out...
- A friend of my dear brother.
But don't bother about it, Inspector.
I'll go and see him myself.
- It will not...
- Yes, you were saying?
It will not be necessary, Professor.
It was just that your request startled me for a moment, but no doubt you have a very good reason.
Now, let me see. You wish to inspect the photographs and records...
Of all the women aliens registered here within the last ten years.
Well, I'll go and get the files.
Visitors to Vandorf are only required to register if they wish later to become citizens.
This is, of course, a very democratic state.
That's a lovely girl, Professor.
This look like her?
- It hardly does her justice, but...
- It looks like her.
How long has she been here?
Well, the information is on the back.
Seven years.
- When did these murders start?
- Murders?
The ones which you failed to solve, and which your democratic state so carefully concealed, Inspector.
When did they start?
- Approximately...
- Not approximately. Exactly.
Five years ago.
Thank you.
Oh, incidentally, I understand some of your democratic citizens tried to eject the late Professor Heitz.
You'd better warn them not to attempt that sort of behaviour with me. Good day.
Dr. Namaroff.
- What is it?
- Mr Heitz is on the telephone.
He wants to make an appointment to see you with Professor Meister.
- Meister?
- From Leipzig University.
I can't see them. Tell them I'm busy.
Mr Heitz was very insistent.
Carla, please.
Do as I say.
Carla.
When you went for your walk last night, you said you were alone.
You lied to me.
Do I have to account to you for everything I do?
You were with Paul Heitz, weren't you?
- Why don't you ask Ratoff?
- I'm asking you.
I am tired of being treated like a criminal.
Why does Ratoff follow me everywhere I go?
Why are you spying on me?
I'm trying to protect you.
I don't believe you.
I've told you before. There are times when you shouldn't be alone.
Tell me about those times.
Tell me what happens to me.
I can't yet.
- Because it's all an invention.
- No.
- You're trying to frighten me.
- I only want to take care of you.
Frighten me, so that I'll submit to being treated like a prisoner.
I've had enough.
I am sick of your jealousy.
I am sick of you.
Paul?
I'm sorry, Dr. Namaroff won't see you.
- Well, why not?
- He says he's too busy.
Paul, meet me tomorrow morning at the Castle Borski at seven o'clock.
Hello?
Hello, Carla?
Well?
Namaroff refuses to see us.
Paul.
Why did you want to come here?
They're less likely to follow me.
No one dares come near the Castle Borski.
When was it last inhabited?
Fifty years ago.
Except for her.
Her?
Megaera.
Why did you want to see me so urgently?
Have you changed your mind?
Oh, yes, Paul.
I will come away with you.
You will?
I don't feel chained to Vandorf any more.
I'm not afraid any longer.
I'll go with you, Paul, but it must be now.
Not immediately, Carla.
- Why?
- Professor Meister is trying to help me.
Do what?
Find Megaera.
Oh, Paul. Oh, Paul, don't stay.
If you love me, take me away from here while there's still time.
- Just as soon as I can. I promise you.
- Now, Paul, now.
It won't be long, Carla.
It'll be too late.
I must go.
I may never see you again.
Carla.
Oh, Paul.
Carla. Carla, listen to me.
Paul.
Did you recognise him?
It was Ratoff.
One of the attendants at the hospital.
Perhaps in future, you'd be good enough to tell me where you're going.
- But why did Ratoff try to kill me?
- I suggest you ask Dr. Namaroff that.
Carla?
Ratoff, have you seen Carla?
Went to her room.
"Carla Hoffman.
"Probationary nurse here in 1903.
"In 1905, believed to be suffering from loss of memory."
In other words, amnesia.
That was five years ago.
"In 1906, underwent intensive treatment and was apparently cured.
"Meanwhile, continued to work in her profession."
Now, let's put some of these pieces together.
The first of the Vandorf murders coincided with these attacks of amnesia.
A condition of which Namaroff was well aware.
Ordinarily, this would have put an end to her career as a nurse, but Namaroff, as you've told me, is in love with her.
- For heaven's sake.
- Just a minute.
In 1906, Namaroff closed the case and stated that she was cured.
But was she cured?
- I don't think so.
- For what possible reason...
Just a moment. I'm coming to that.
She told you that she was being watched.
- Because Namaroff is jealous.
- Possibly.
And possibly also because she still loses her memory around the time of the full moon.
How do you know that?
It's all here, Paul. All the dates, when the amnesia occurred and reoccurred.
Then you seriously believe it?
- You seriously suspect that Carla is...
- Why shouldn't I?
- I'm not in love with her.
- Oh, you're mad.
A young girl as beautiful as Carla?
I'm not making any physical comparisons, Paul, between her and Megaera.
Megaera died 2,000 years ago.
It's her spirit we're concerned with today.
It's found a resting place in somebody.
- Not Carla.
- In the cemetery, you begged her to go away. She refused. Why?
She was not ready to leave.
She couldn't leave, Paul.
It was the full moon.
The spirit of Megaera was too strong.
And then, today, she asked you to take her away.
- Didn't she? Immediately.
- She was frightened of Namaroff.
- Did she say so?
- Yes.
I'll tell you why she was frightened, Paul.
Because tonight is the first night of the full moon.
Oh, this is guesswork.
It's monstrous, circumstantial, utterly without reason.
I should've taken her away. I only stayed because I thought you needed me.
I do need you, Paul.
Oh, no, not after this.
All you need is somebody to agree with you.
And what are you trying to do to me? To Carla? Destroy us?
Paul!
Paul!
I had to see you again.
It's all right. We're going away today.
It's too late.
Why?
Why is it too late?
I don't know.
I could have gone yesterday.
But now I just can't go.
It seems we have visitors.
You had better take her upstairs.
Come on.
I wish to see Mr Heitz.
Will you tell him, please?
- I take it that you are Dr. Namaroff?
- I am.
Come in.
My name is Meister, Karl Meister.
I've been looking forward to meeting you, Doctor.
I'd like to make this brief, if you don't mind.
In the early hours of this morning, a young woman was seen in the grounds of this house.
Indeed.
I have reason to believe she is here now.
Is she a patient of yours, Doctor?
I am responsible for her.
Yes. Yes, of course, an amnesia victim is a great responsibility.
What did you say?
One never really knows what they're capable of, does one?
They might even commit murder during one of their lapses.
And no one would be any the wiser.
Where is Carla?
She is not here.
You're lying.
Search the house.
I warn you not to obstruct the law.
I have a search warrant.
Mr Heitz, if she's not found,
I shall charge you with her abduction.
On what grounds?
I can produce the evidence.
Speaking of evidence, Dr. Namaroff, perhaps you'd be good enough to return this to Mr Ratoff with my compliments.
He left it behind him when he attempted to kill Mr Heitz yesterday.
- What are you insinuating?
- I'm not insinuating anything, Doctor.
You sent Ratoff to follow Carla to the Castle Borski, where she met Paul.
When she left, Ratoff attempted to kill Paul with this knife.
Why do you want Paul out of the way, Namaroff?
Is it because you're afraid he'll take Carla away from you?
Or because you think he'll find out the secret that you share with Ratoff?
Answer me.
How dare you?
Take your hands off me.
Professor Meister.
If you don't release the doctor this instant, I won't hesitate to shoot.
- Well?
- She's not in the house.
- Have you looked in every room?
- Everywhere.
- The attic. Have you searched the attic?
- She's not there.
Where is she, Paul?
I told them the truth.
Where has she gone?
In about an hour's time, there's a train for Leipzig.
She will be on it.
You arranged for somewhere for her to stay in Leipzig, Paul?
She will be at the Hotel Kramer.
And you will be joining her there?
When we've found Megaera.
You should have gone with her.
I was very tempted.
Well, why didn't you?
You came here because of me.
When we've found Megaera, then I shall join Carla in Leipzig.
I shouldn't depend on that, Paul.
She won't reach Leipzig.
She won't even be on the train.
Are you persisting in this preposterous theory?
If they find her before she reaches the station, I shall have proved nothing.
If, however, she does reach the station, she will be in Leipzig this evening at five o'clock.
In which case, I suggest you telephone the Hotel Kramer about five thirty.
Come in.
- Any news?
- No, sir.
- Police will be giving up in an hour.
- Giving up?
They won't search after dark.
It's a full moon, Dr. Namaroff.
The second night of the full moon.
You haven't forgotten it's the night Megaera usually strikes?
Get out.
Carla.
Carla.
You're quite sure?
Yes, thank you.
She hasn't arrived.
They must've caught her before she got to the station.
I doubt it. I hope for your sake, Paul, that
I'm wrong, but we're looking for the truth.
The fact that she hasn't arrived proves nothing.
Nothing at all. But do we discard my theory because it upsets your scheme of things?
Or do we go on looking for the truth?
She's out there somewhere. I'm going to look.
Wait, Paul. In an hour's time, it'll be dark. Wait until the morning.
Paul. Paul, you won't find Carla.
Get out of my way.
I am sorry, Paul, but I can't let you destroy yourself.
What the devil do you want?
I have a warrant for the arrest of Paul Heitz.
- On what charge?
- The abduction of Carla Hoffman.
Oh, that's ridiculous. You saw for yourself that she wasn't in the house.
Will you please inform Mr Heitz?
I'll give him five minutes to get dressed.
He's not there.
- Well, where is he?
- I haven't the slightest idea, Inspector.
Professor, you will accompany me to the police station.
- I shall do no such thing.
- Bring him along.
Carla?
Carla!
I am waiting for Carla, Mr Heitz.
Carla.
She's free now, Paul.
She's free.
Lieutenant!
Good morning.
Boy, with a good-looking nurse like that on board, I wouldn't mind running a fever.
Just remember, sailor,
I've got lots of castor oil in sickbay.
And you, too.
Yes, sir... Ma'am.
Lieutenant!
Thanks.
Oh, a gorilla.
Are we going to make surveys of animals on this trip, too, Commander?
No, this is just for our own amusement.
This has nothing to do with our report to the UN.
Well, I don't see how you can be amused by gorillas.
I think they're dull.
Well, this one is 60 feet tall.
What do you think of him?
Sixty feet?
That's right. This is Kong.
The strongest living creature on earth.
Oh, yes, I remember.
A legend.
And yet, underlying that old legend is some truth.
Are you saying that Kong is not just fictional?
Yes, I'll show you.
I've devoted a good many years to research on Kong.
Data I've obtained... shows that a giant anthropoid had lived on an island in this area.
It still may be there.
It may. See this picture?
Right here.
These are steps from some ancient stone ruins.
I thought so, too, when I first saw it.
But those steps are each 10 feet high.
No human can climb that high in one step.
What do you think, Commander?
What I'm trying to figure out is... who built it?
And for what purpose?
Do the islanders really think this was done by a giant ape?
The natives of the Java Sea most definitely believe in Kong.
And, Susan, look at this tunnel.
This is also Kong's work.
Which island is it?
The island is Mondo.
Right there.
Just a little way off our course.
Cdr. Nelson, take us there for a look.
Sorry, we have no time to spare.
We're here to seek oil, you know.
We have our orders from the United Nations Research Council.
I wish there were some way, but...
He's exactly like the original Kong.
With this, the world is ours.
It's still not the original.
- You sure you just didn't build a giant toy?
- A toy?
That's an insult.
How can you say that?
It is the strongest thing there is in the world today.
Need I remind you how I feel about that?
How does it help my government get Element X?
This robot can do anything I program.
You can see that I had it constructed exactly as Carl Nelson planned it.
This man, Nelson, is interesting.
Will you get on to the point?
Most certainly.
The giant Kong was Nelson's model.
This famous scientist researched the legend... and he reconstructed the strongest creature on earth.
You stole it.
Mmm-hmm.
I took his drawings... and my genius translated them into a robot Kong... that can certainly do anything the original Kong would have done.
That ego is showing again.
Remember, my country buys results.
Doctor, we do not underwrite your precious ego.
I quite understand.
I shall soon let my Kong show you that he can certainly do the job.
Obtain Element X, Dr. Who, and you succeed.
My government insists you succeed.
You understand that?
I do, Madame.
We are all ready to start.
You'll observe my creation doing now what's never been done.
We'll go outside.
Forty-two thousand.
Mark!
The rays of Element X are strong.
You are aware the entire world has unearthed... the total of only three ounces of this rare element.
No one could mine, until now, this crater.
Down there is a deposit of tons.
My robot Kong is in position.
After all these years of labor, success has come.
He will bring out
10,000 tons of X, this robot.
We are ready, Doctor.
Test results?
Excellent, sir.
Shortly, your country is going to gain nuclear domination of the universe.
America and the Soviets can never catch up.
Shouldn't we count on this taking years, Doctor?
A hundred days, Madame.
That soon?
Element X is unparalleled.
You'll create a nuclear arsenal fast.
I predict you'll rule the entire world in time.
This is an historic day.
It's quite a treasure you turned up at the North Pole, huh?
Shall we get under way?
All right, you may start.
Right.
That robot is extraordinary.
The real Kong couldn't do what it can.
What's happened?
It's nearly there now.
You did that?
No, sir!
Get out.
What's wrong?
The magnetic mass has destroyed his circuits.
We will start again.
I want you to redesign this circuitry and shield it.
You are to work day and night.
We shall start right now.
Where are you going, Madame?
Don't you know, Doctor?
Don't desert us now.
It's only going to take us a short while longer.
Do what you want to. Our country is withdrawing all aid, Doctor.
You can't do this.
I must ask that you reconsider.
You force me to delay the new construction, and the source of Element X is mine.
Only I can take it.
What if another country gets it, not yours?
Should I take that as a threat?
Your country already has a huge stake in the robot.
I don't suggest you quit.
All right, I'll request that we grant you the extra time you want.
Dr. Who,
I should mention this: more of your blundering, and you're through.
Control Guard.
Control!
Turn it off!
Hey, get him out. Hurry!
Come on, give me your hand.
Up you go. Come on.
Secure the engine.
All stations, report your damage.
How does it look down there?
Hey, something's wrong with the rudder.
Water pipe on the port side broken.
- What happened?
- Rockslide down the canyon wall, sir.
Commander, we should take a look at the rudder.
All right.
Surface for repairs.
Control!
Aye, aye, sir.
Surface, 15 degrees.
We'll have to check the nuclear reactors.
Sir, we're getting the repairs under way.
Thanks.
That rockslide was made to order.
There's a perfect bay for anchoring on that island.
Let's take advantage of it while the ship is being repaired.
You're hurt.
Why didn't you come for treatment right away?
- It's nothing.
- I wish you would do as you're told.
First chance I get to do my job as a nurse, and you...
Oh, my.
What are you laughing at, sir?
I can't help it.
You've got your wish, and I'll get mine.
We'll be landing on Mondo Island.
That's funny.
There are no villagers here this time.
Was the island inhabited?
Do you understand?
Yes. It's a Javanese dialect.
He's warning us not to enter.
He says that it's taboo, and that it must not be broken.
Kong?
Wong. That means, "king."
The natives call him King Kong.
He says we're trespassing on Kong's home.
Do you mean he actually exists?
We'll soon find out.
Let's get hold of the old one and see what else we can learn.
- Susan, you'd better wait here.
- Alone?
You're safer here.
Watch yourself.
This way.
Over there.
No, don't shoot. Wait.
Kong!
Look.
Put me down, Kong.
Put me down!
Down!
Kong, put me down!
Please, Kong. Down.
Susan!
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait. We can't leave him like this.
It's our only chance.
Now come on.
Hurry. We're lost if he catches us this time.
Look, starboard.
He jammed the controls.
Look, there's Kong.
I think we stabilized it.
Hang on. Here we go.
Take the controls.
Stop firing!
Stop firing!
Hold it, men.
This is your commander.
We're coming aboard.
Give the order to dive.
Prepare to dive.
Rig to dive.
All right, sir?
Yes.
Stand by for emergency dive.
We can't, sir.
The rudder's not working yet.
Well, then, we'll just have to make...
Hey!
How are you doing?
Are you through?
Not yet, sir.
- How much longer?
- Should be about 10 minutes more.
That long?
All right. Hurry.
I don't think he means to sink the ship.
Is he playing a game with us?
No.
I don't think he is.
What do you intend to do?
He wants us to get out there, so I'll go out and quiet him down.
Commander, I'll go out.
I won't let you.
Kong let me go when he had me in the palm of his hand.
Commander, let me go, please.
He wants me.
Is there any other way?
All right.
See if you can win some time for us.
We've got to get out of this inlet.
Make preparations to dive.
Make emergency repairs.
Aye, sir.
Susan.
You okay?
Take care.
Kong, please!
Don't shake the ship.
I sleep and I eat on this ship.
Engine rooms, A-okay.
You'd better stand watch outside.
When we're ready to dive, call Susan in.
Put me down. Please!
No. No, Kong.
Take me back.
Take me back to the ship, Kong.
Let's go to the ship. Please.
I don't want to go with you.
Thank you, Kong.
Susan, we're all ready.
Goodbye, Kong.
You gave us quite a scare out there.
Your attention, please.
We're dropping everything and heading directly for UN headquarters in New York.
Our report will create a sensation among the world's scientists.
And you'd better get out of those wet clothes.
Kong is back on shore.
This is Mondo Island, the home of Kong.
And in addition to Kong... there are mammoth reptiles living on the island... that have long since become extinct on other continents.
This island could be called a living museum of the prehistoric age.
This concludes my report.
Are there any questions?
At the meeting of the scientific committee this morning... it was decided to send the Explorer out again.
Is this for the purpose of capturing Kong?
No, not to capture him, but to study him in his natural habitat.
It would be, to say the least, difficult to care for him here in New York.
Will you be accompanied by the same crew?
Yes. Essentially the same crew will go on the expedition.
Especially Lt. Cdr. Nomura and Miss Watson, sitting here beside me.
They are very well-known to Kong.
Kong was apparently gentle with Lt. Watson. May I ask why?
Miss Watson, do you know a reason you can tell me?
It's very easy for us to understand.
You see, as ridiculous as it may sound...
Kong is a male and Miss Watson is...
Well, see for yourselves, gentlemen.
If there are no further questions...
I will now turn the meeting over to the Chairman of the Council.
Thank you very much for your kind attention.
Code signal, LCM3.
Go ahead.
My country is going to grant you more time.
Nelson sold you on the Kong, huh?
We can now use his Kong to do the digging for us.
The real Kong's a mammal.
Could he stand the radiation, Doctor?
Kong can resist it better than anything.
He cannot stand it forever, though.
We will only need the big beast a day or two, you know.
I think that, that will have to do.
I agree.
Now I shall go after him.
Can you get Kong to obey you?
You should consider that,
Doctor.
You should know that I do.
You should also know, we can't go on without your aid.
You can do this without additional aid.
You can control Kong as Nelson did.
A woman is the secret.
Susan Watson got Kong to do anything she asked.
Might I ask, what do we do with Watson and Nelson when we're through?
That is quite easy.
Merely a dirty detail.
I'll support you
30 days more.
How you do it is your concern.
I want you to succeed.
I should hate to hear that you had died.
Must proceed quickly.
The Explorer, with Nelson, will be here any day.
- Your copters should be ready right now.
- Yes, sir.
There he is.
- All right, get ready.
- Ready, sir.
Away.
That's good. Let's land.
Excellent.
Hook up to him.
Yes, yes. Kong's mine now.
Ready to go, sir.
That's good.
Prepare to land.
This proves Kong's still on the island.
Yeah, I think he's still here.
Had a recent rendezvous.
He must be near here someplace.
We don't want to excite him, so just the three of us will go on from here.
Aye, sir. Let's go.
Kong's opponents were human beings.
It smells like ether.
Lieutenant... have the men collect samples of these shell casings.
Then let's spread out and search for Kong.
We should be able to find him easily enough, if he's lying around someplace.
Okay, get going.
It looks like Kong escaped after putting up a terrific battle.
Yes. Still, I don't know.
Carl! Carl!
Here.
He's been shot.
Is there any chance?
What did he say?
He said that an Oriental skeleton... a devil with eyes like a gutter rat... kidnapped Kong and took him away into the skies.
- Lieutenant, see that he has a decent burial.
- Yes, sir.
Was he the only one here?
It looks that way.
Wish we could have talked to the old one sooner.
He told us enough.
I have an idea who the kidnapper is.
It must be my old friend... that international
Judas, Dr. Who.
Send this rush to New York.
Aye, aye.
"Proceed immediately to Station 6318, north.
"Start investigation at the nearest field office."
Right here. That's Tokyo.
It looks like an
Asiatic country is tied in.
A check in Tokyo will tell us where this came from.
I don't know.
Do you really think we can locate Kong?
Sure. We'll find him.
As long as they haven't taken him to the North Pole.
All right.
Come down.
Knock before you enter next time.
All right, state what it is you want.
New York, huh?
The UN has begun to ask a lot of questions about us.
The members of the UN Science Council already know this name.
Don't worry about them.
You sure you removed all evidence?
Yes. Worry not.
I can outwit the UN any day and anytime.
Did you see our giant ape?
My thought is that under ether he won't be much use.
You underrate what a genius I am.
I can control the ape.
Will he do as you order?
Hypnotic susceptibility.
That's the secret.
Hypnosis?
A creature with Kong's intelligence is easily handled.
That's another little thing
I learned through Carl Nelson.
Recall, Doctor. You agreed that you would get Carl Nelson's crew... so that they could handle
Kong, yes?
Nelson and his crew will be on their way soon.
This is their last trip.
They will aid us as needed, then we will just do away with them.
A Japanese aircraft
is calling the Commander.
I will connect you, sir.
Roger. Put him through. Over.
An emergency has arisen.
I have been sent
from the UN Field Office...
to transport you to Tokyo
as fast as possible.
Cdr. Nelson, Lt. Cdr. Nomura,
and Lt. Watson...
are requested to immediately collect
all pertinent evidence...
and transfer to this aircraft.
Over and out.
Right here.
What is this emergency situation?
The Kong has gone ashore at Hokkaido, sir.
Hokkaido?
Yes, early today.
We're under orders to take you and your crew there right away.
I don't trust the pilot.
And I don't think they're Japanese.
Release him.
Is it all right?
He'll do whatever I say.
Kong, you are to obey these orders.
Listen. Element X is in the crater.
You will go out there and dig it up.
That tunnel will take him right into our crater.
Let's hope that nothing goes wrong now.
Kong, you must dig faster.
Kong!
Continue.
Go ahead. Remember, you're to dig it up.
My Kong could never dig like that.
Kong, what's the matter?
You're slowing down.
Wake up!
Dig!
Kong, you must do
as I order. Dig.
Continue to dig. Kong!
Wake up.
You shall not sleep.
Wake up!
Dig!
Dig, Kong. Dig.
Can't you hear?
Go on, you idiot ape.
Kong. Kong, wake up.
I command you.
Dig, you dumb beast.
Out. Get away.
Let's go again.
Kong, once again. Dig!
The beast has escaped.
Close the tunnel, quick.
Right.
Just as I thought. Kong could very easily stand the radiation.
Unluckily, we couldn't maintain the power that we had.
- Now what?
- Sir, Nelson's in the laboratory.
Oh!
Carl Nelson is here now?
Aye.
They constructed a robot just like ours.
Looks like Dr. Who wasn't satisfied with a robot.
He wanted the real Kong.
Carl, glad you could come.
Nomura, you, too.
Been a long time.
Obviously, not enough years to suit me.
What is this all about?
Is Kong here?
Yes.
That's where he is usually kept.
What do you think of this Kong?
Do you recognize your brainchild?
You'd steal Niagara Falls for a drink of water.
But... you want the real Kong to do something the robot can't do.
Right?
I'm after X, Nelson.
Element X?
Mmm-hmm.
Under the ice here is all I want.
Only Kong's muscle can get it all out.
You know what we can get from him.
You can't use the robot, huh?
And Kong won't do what you want him to do.
- That's why you brought us here.
- You are so right.
You think we'll agree to help you?
I predicted you would not.
Will you, Lt. Watson?
I won't help you, either.
We shall see.
Come.
Well, this is great.
It's a pretty odd lab.
So this is Dr. Who's guest room.
With no color television.
At least we can joke a little.
Actually,
I'm awfully afraid.
We all are, Susan.
If Who manages to extract the Element X... there'll be no object in keeping us alive.
Nelson, you are to come.
Hello there.
Won't you sit down?
Would you like a drink?
Yeah. Why not?
You know,
I'm slightly confused.
You take your typical
Oriental Mata Hari, now...
What are you saying?
Let me put it this way.
If you'll excuse the corny cliché... what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
My answer is a corny cliché.
Did you ever hear it?
Don't judge a book according to its cover.
Or a snake, by its color.
That's well-put.
What's your connection with Dr. Who?
Business.
But you should know that I don't really want to go on in it.
Tell me one thing first.
Do you work for him, or does he work for you?
Does life here in the North interest you?
My dear, we can easily get all the world capitals.
London, Paris...
I can arrange it so this lab is yours.
Please stay here with me.
You can run the whole thing, Carl.
If the money holds out.
What if there's no country to buy Element X... once you mine it?
You don't have to be worried about that.
You're not Japanese. Chinese?
Thai? Vietnam? Burma?
You're getting warm, Carl.
Getting too warm.
All right.
He's a hard one to handle.
Nelson's an unusual man.
He is not the kind of man that you are used to.
That's why he appeals to me.
An idealist.
But I know how to make him do anything we want.
Susan. Look at it this way: it can only get better.
Because it certainly can't get any worse.
Carl, look.
Carl, may I see you outside?
What is it this time?
Torture?
It's been too long since we've had a game of chess together.
Your two friends are quite affectionate.
They could be happy, if you don't interfere.
Susan.
Now the cell temperature is zero.
You know they can't stand the bitter cold.
You know what will happen, unless you rescue them.
Only a little cooperation will do it.
Susan, here.
This will...
No, Jiro.
It's better this way.
If you'd just cooperate... those young people could be enjoying a little hot tea right now, Carl.
Kong will listen more to those two than to me.
Check.
Those walls are being turned into ice.
Why won't you save them?
Why should you endure this when it is not necessary?
Nelson cannot aid you any longer.
He's been cancelled.
You dog.
I am a realist, and I need you.
So I am going to be generous.
I will let you go without a bit of trouble and with lots of cash.
You just have to do one thing for me.
You think I wouldn't kill you?
I could and I would.
Susan!
Susan!
Jiro!
Jiro!
Do you think you can change your ideals now?
Are you ready with an answer right now?
Susan, don't do it.
Shut up.
Let's see how your hero likes you when you're disfigured a little bit.
Let's see what the ice will do to your lovely skin.
No. Susan!
It's Kong.
It's Kong.
Kong's escaped.
Get the keys.
Hurry, Susan.
Kong's escaped!
Look out!
The robot is ready.
Go get that ape.
- You're still alive.
- How did you get out of the chamber?
- Dr. Who left the keys on the desk...
- Talk later. We've got to go.
This way.
Don't worry, there's no poison in this.
It looks like we have all failed.
Let's forget Element X and enjoy a drink.
Stand up.
Can Kong stay in the water a long time?
Yes, he can swim a little.
More than you can.
He travels from Mondo to other islands as he pleases.
Don't you realize that you are through, Doctor?
We're all through.
We are all leaving now in pursuit. Get ready to go.
You're a failure.
Not a chance of that.
You'll see when I get Kong, and this girl will do what I say.
Get going.
Ready. Lower.
Let it down.
The radio just had some interesting news.
Kong swam ashore, near Tokyo.
Don't go. Don't take that robot into Tokyo.
I cannot permit it.
Wait. It could be our last chance to get Kong.
At sea, our robot Kong cannot get him.
On ground, the machine will take the real Kong without any doubt.
I'm not concerned about which one wins.
There's too great a risk.
It just can't be.
Why are you so highhanded,
Madame?
If those two fight in Tokyo... thousands would get killed, and you and I know it.
Suddenly, you're such a moralist.
Tell us, how come?
Element X is a real killer.
Not millions, not 10 millions...
100 or so millions would get killed this time.
It's just that my country...
We can't stand an international incident right now.
Dear Madame, let's talk inside.
The giant Kong has swum ashore...
and he's approaching
the center of Tokyo.
The Defense Agency urgently requests
all citizens to take shelter immediately.
Take shelter immediately.
Please, we should hurry.
Why are you helping us now?
My work now isn't so important, but you are.
Something happen between you and Dr. Who?
I can't tell you.
When you get to shore, lead Kong outside Tokyo.
Otherwise, thousands will get killed.
You're coming with us.
Sorry. I can't do it.
You can't stay behind, you'll be alone.
You don't know what Dr. Who will do.
Don't worry about it.
The things you're going to need are in the next cabin.
We just can't let you stay here.
You should know that I represent a certain country.
I'll take full responsibility for you.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry my country wasn't right.
Now hurry.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Good luck.
Hey, you!
Where are you going? Hey, you!
Don't use that gun.
You'll get the whole country out here.
Don't do it! Don't!
Here's where he came ashore.
He first appeared in the bay, here.
Stop your attack immediately.
If you force Kong to fight, he'll destroy the city.
- Who are you?
- I'm... Well, I'm out of uniform... but I'm Cdr. Carl Nelson, captain of the UN submarine, Explorer.
Yes.
Now, we'll do everything we can to try and calm him down.
But you must hold off your troops.
Hey!
Let me go.
Please, don't.
He'll get angry.
Then he'll destroy the city.
Headquarters.
Turn off lights. Fall back.
Fall back.
That's right, sir. Hold it!
Hey!
It's all right.
Kong!
The UN?
Yeah.
Take this. Here.
Kong!
Kong!
Is she insane?
She's all right.
Kong is always gentle with her.
Calm down, Kong.
We're your friends.
Hey! Look at that!
Oh, no.
Come on, take shelter.
Hurry!
Where can we go?
Look at that.
No, Kong, run away.
You mustn't fight him.
It's not alive, it's a machine.
You can't defeat him, Kong.
Kong! Run away! Run away!
The real Kong seems quicker.
My Kong won't tire.
Behind you. Get the girl.
Kong! Kong!
Kong, listen!
You will return quietly
to the ship.
If you don't,
I'll drop the girl.
Help me. Kong!
We will get him now.
Prepare to dock the ship.
You each know your job.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well?
My plans were really correct.
We're a success.
A gun, Madame?
You're going to die.
Step back there and turn around.
What did you do?
Nothing.
I'm Nomura with the UN.
Yes, sir.
- I need a ranger unit, order it.
- Right.
On the double!
Susan, wait.
Wait there.
Jiro.
Hold on.
Go on. Easy.
Go get them a rope.
Susan, don't worry.
We're just about there.
Kong.
Susan!
Jiro!
There they are.
Susan.
Quick, the other control.
Stop it, let her go.
Hey, get out of here.
Let's go!
Go!
- Susan!
- Commander!
Thank God, you're alive.
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all over now.
Weigh anchor right away.
What's wrong here?
Shouldn't we wait till Kong is brought here?
Moron! The real Kong is lost to us.
Kong's coming!
He's here, on the docks.
Kong's on the docks?
Yes.
We have to go.
You said we were here... to get Kong and the girl.
No, get us out of here now.
Now! Do as I say.
Kong, stop that ship.
Get the ship, Kong.
Sir, hello.
Will he catch it?
Yeah. I think he will.
On deck. Let's go.
There he is.
Let's get him.
Keep firing.
Let's go.
Kong! Kong!
King Kong!
Don't call.
Yeah, let him go.
But he's going...
He's going home.
I think he's had enough of what we call civilization.

Once drawn by that merciless wind...
...the fair youth of morning is at dusk naught but bones.
In the end, all must die.
Numberless are the sins committed on the way to death.
For those sins, there may be punishment in the law.
Some may slip through its net...
...but the awareness of sin cannot be escaped.
Religion imagines...
...a world after death, dealing punishment in place of the law.
That world is Hell.
'This is a tale of things...
'... not of this world...
'A tale of the "Sai no Kawara"...
'... the bank of the river...
'... where stone is piled on stone at the boundary of Hell.'
Concepts of Hell
This concept of hell is not unique to Buddhism.
Zoroastrianism, Christianity,
Islam, all these religions...
...posit this world after death.
In India the concept is thought to have arisen with Hinduism...
...linked with reincarnation.
With the rise of Buddhism came the concept of 'naraka'...
...the Sanskrit word for 'hell', which means 'abominable'...
...or 'tormenting'.
This word exists in Japanese as NARAKU.
I'll bet that guy died.
You think so?!
And if he did?
Tamura!
Anyway, congratulations.
You're engaged to Yukiko.
I heard something...
...about Prof. Yajima, your future father-in-law.
In Japan, the concept of Hell most commonly imagined...
...is the Eight Great Hells of the Buddhist sutras.
There are many sutras that take up the subject of Hell.
He talks like a saint, but he's got a dark secret...
...something he feels guilty about.
It was during the war... in Malaya.
Who is this guy Tamura?
I know I don't like him.
Can't I get away from him?
Last night would have been the happiest of my life...
... but for that damned accident!
Hello.
Professor... Mrs Yajima... thank you very much.
I'll try to make Yukiko happy.
Take good care of her.
Yes, sir.
I'm so happy, Yukiko!
Thank you, Mother.
Mr Shimizu...
...Yukiko's our only child, and she's a bit spoiled.
But with you, we can rest easy.
Please look after her.
Study hard, and be a scholar in my husband's footsteps.
I will.
Congratulations.
Tamura!
Surprised to see me?
I'd rung the bell, but I didn't want to be turned away again.
Anyway, congratulations.
We should have a drink to celebrate your engagement...
...but uninvited guests shouldn't stay too long, so I'll be going.
I'll return this.
I'll give you a lift.
Mrs Yajima... your clock's stopped.
They say that's a bad omen.
'Night.
Take it. You're behind on your rent and your tuition.
I like you, man.
I know everything.
I know you've been sleeping with Yukiko.
What if she's pregnant?
Can you turn there?
It's a bad road.
There's a stop I want to make.
Look out!
You hit me, you bastard!
Hey! Goddamn you!
I'm Tiger Kyoichi of the Gondo Syndicate!
Kyoichi!
Kyoichi! Are you all right?!
Get up!
Kyoichi! What's wrong?!
Stop the car! You hit that guy!
I'm not stopping. No one saw us.
That drunk jumped in front of me!
That doesn't matter. We hit him!
What?
This only happened because you took me out of my way.
The man might be dead.
If he is, we're both murderers!
Is something wrong?
No, nothing.
I didn't sleep last night.
Don't overdo it.
Yukiko's expecting you tonight.
Kyoichi!
Mother...
Are you sure you didn't see who did it?
Shut up! I said I don't know!
If I ever find out who it was...
'Last night on a road in Kamiuma, Setagaya Ward...
'... Kyoichi Shiga, 34, of the Gondo crime syndicate...
'... was struck while inebriated by a passing vehicle...
'... and died of brain hemorrhage.
'The driver of the vehicle remains unknown.'
So you want to stick a manslaughter charge on me?
We're the ones who killed him.
We caused it.
We'll both go. Come with me.
That might satisfy you, but not me.
It'd be stupid.
He was drunk. He walked into the road. It was suicide.
And he was just some yakuza scum.
He's not worth the best years of our lives.
Going so soon?
I've settled your fate for you.
If you go down, you go with me.
In Memory
The Gondo Syndicate
The syndicate paid for the funeral, but how will we live now?
You must have seen the car that hit him.
You were out there!
No, I didn't.
But Yoko... what would you do if you knew who it was?
Find the guy and kill him.
Look what he's done to us!
I didn't tell the police, but I saw the car.
Ten years ago...
...a truck hit my husband.
He got killed, and the driver didn't even go to jail.
It's no use telling the police.
Yoko... you and me, we'll get even for this.
No one will know it was us.
We'll kill him!
Yukiko!
I've been waiting!
I just had to see you!
Shiro...
I'm...
Is something wrong?
Yukiko... I...
...killed a man.
Listen...
...there were two of them.
We can trace the license number.
No matter how long it takes, we'll get them.
OK?
Let's talk to my father.
He'll think of something.
I can't think. It's like something's chasing me!
Shiro! You've got to stay calm!
There's no taxis...
A taxi?
Let's walk to the station.
I don't feel like taking a taxi.
The faster I get there the better.
Please! Forget the taxi.
I really don't want one.
You're acting like a child!
Get in...
Where to?
The police station.
Don't go too fast...
Yukiko!
Yukiko!
Shiro... I don't want to die...
I don't want to die...
Yukiko!
Yukiko!
Shimizu... don't blame yourself.
It was fate.
Professor...
...I insisted on the taxi.
It's like I killed her!
Dear...
Mrs Yajima...
You shouldn't have come here.
Go away, please.
Go away, please!
Mrs Yajima!
Give back my daughter!
Give back my daughter!
Fumi!
Give back my daughter!
That's right... suffer.
Your conscience almost won.
You were about to sell me out.
Are you going to win?
Or am I?
Stop it!
Take it easy, will you?
Have a drink with me.
I'm a mess.
Let's dance.
My name's Yoko. What's yours?
Why don't we go somewhere else?
I'm going.
No!
Hotel Yoshino
'Shiro Shimizu'....
It's him!
He's the one who killed Kyoichi!
Can I see you again tonight?
Sure.
I'm glad.
9 o'clock at the bar, OK?
Don't forget.
It's him. No mistake about it.
Yoko, you've got that stuff, don't you?
Yeah.
Kyoichi... it won't be long.
I'm going to even the score.
Once I finish them,
I'll be coming to join you.
Mother ill. Come immediately.
Father.

Oh, you're Shiro, from Tokyo!
Yes.
I'm Kinuko. I came here last year.
Oh.
This way.
Mother?
It's Shiro.
Shiro!
Mother!
Mother...
...how's Father?
You silly thing!
Your son's very good-looking.
He's got lovely eyes!
Maybe I'll cheat on you.
I want to go back to Tokyo!
Don't talk nonsense!
It's no surprise, sick as I am.
Auntie!
You're Shiro, aren't you.
Yes.
I'm Sachiko. I sent the telegram.
How nice that he came!
Thank you.
Her father paints. Last year they moved into the next room.
He's an old friend of your father's.
The next room?
Father...
Shiro... you're here...
Hello, Father.
Your mother's better.
I'm having a painting of Hell done for Jiganji Temple.
This is Ensai Taniguchi.
He can paint, but he ruined himself with drink...
...and ended up here.
Aren't you taking your walk this morning?
'Morning.
You're up early, Detective.
It's almost finished, huh?
So, Sachiko... is this where all the bad people go?
Ensai... have you thought about what I asked you?
The answer's no.
I won't have Sachiko marrying a man like you.
No?
You're wanted for fraud in Osaka, aren't you.
The Prefectural Police called about a case of art forgery.
Are you going to arrest me?
They'd make a fine couple!
It'd be good to have a policeman in the family, too.
Let's do this...
When the picture's done, we'll all have a little talk.
Dr Kusama!
The old man's getting worse!
OK.
Hurry!
Yeah, yeah...
Quickly, Doctor!
I know!
The doctor's here.
It's not just him, Doctor.
We're all weak.
It's the food here!
You're skimming off the food money!
Who's skimming?!
The Welfare Office gives us Yen 62 a day.
We spend Yen 70.
The food's fine!
Sachiko...
You're going to marry me.
Let go!
Please!
You like Sachiko, don't you.
Shiro!
Don't do that!
You almost got hit!
I did?
I saw you wandering along the tracks like that...
You've been here four days now.
Your mother's better.
I'd given up hope.
She said when she got better she'd take me to Tokyo.
That's all I think about.
Tamura!
How's it going?
I thought I'd take a trip and see how you were.
What's happened?
Excuse me.
She looks exactly like Yukiko, doesn't she.
The Yajimas are a bit better.
He's on a lecture tour right now.
He said they might stop here.
Tamura, please!
Go back to Tokyo, will you?
Stay away from me!
I'll put up at that inn over there.
I'll be here a while.
See you.
Shiro!
Shiro!
Your mother's taken a turn for the worse!
Wait!
If she dies, you're going back to Tokyo, aren't you?
Take me with you! Please!
Mother!
'I bow in homage to the divine Buddha.

Professor... Mrs Yajima...
Shimizu... there's no need to say anything.
We're all starting over.
Yukiko!
Yukiko!
Yukiko!
Dr Kusama...
...I'm still a reporter.
What did Gozo's wife die of?
A heart attack.
Hmm...
What does 'hmm' mean?
Are you suggesting my diagnosis was wrong?
Apologize!
It was wrong.
Who the hell are you?!
Tamura!
Mrs Shimizu died of medical malpractice.
You knew that, and you made sure she didn't see another doctor.
What?!
That's not true!
It was Gozo who killed Ito!
Father!
Living with a mistress while his wife lies sick in the next room!
A long time ago,
Ito and I were lovers.
He stole her from me!
I what?!
Everyone knows that!
You freeloader!
What?
Fool!
You've got no shame!
Father!
Damn him!
Idiot!
It's all right, Doctor. Relax.
You're not the only killer here.
What do you mean?
Silence!
Everyone here has killed.
What does that mean?
Even you, Detective.
Last summer you took a bribe and framed a man for it.
He couldn't face people.
He killed himself.
Mr Akigawa, you killed a man with an inaccurate article.
No!
I went to him and apologized!
After he was dead.
And then there's this fine figure of a man...
...the God-like Director of this shabby old place...
...the Tenjoen
Senior Citizens' Facility.
Not content with this pretty mistress, he has another in town...
...the Missus of the Tonchuken tavern.
That's enough!
And your comrades in Malaya,
Dr Yajima?
Sir!
Old Tome's dead!
You two killed him!
All you think about is the damn tenth anniversary festival!

They look good!
Can we eat these things?
At least they're cheap, Doctor!
And they're fresh.
Well, we don't want food poisoning.
Who cares?
These are for the old folks, not us!
That's big of you!

...my father insists I go to town and buy him some paint.
I'll be back tonight. I hate to leave when it's so busy...
Has Mr Tamura gone?
Yes.
And I'm leaving with Prof. Yajima tomorrow.
Back to Tokyo?
I wanted you to take
Father and me hiking!
You're no fun!
Is this a love scene?
Here I was planning to sneak off somewhere alone with Shiro!
You like him, don't you.
Me, I love this man!
Shiro, which one of us do you like?
Sachiko...
Excuse me.
'Bye.
Let's go on a date, Shiro.
I forgot this when I brought the fish. Are you Mr Shimizu?
This is for you.
Who's it from?
'I had to see you.
I've come all the way here.
'Meet me at Tsuribashi Bridge.
'Yoko.'
How are you... 'Shiro'?
How do you know my name?
I know your name...
...I know everything.
I was Kyoichi Shiga's woman.
The man you hit and killed.
His mother saw you.
We found your names right away.
And I...
...came here to kill you!
I was in love with you till I found out who you were.
I'm sorry!
Don't do it. There'll be lots of time to die.
I thought this would happen.
I know everything, don't forget.
Tamura! Who are you?!
If not for you...
Just do what I tell you and you'll be fine.
Tamura!
Tamura!
Tamura!
It's not an elaborate meal, but we hope...
...you enjoy this celebration.
You're too modest, Mr Shimizu!
At least the heads are still on the fish!
Congratulations!
The Tonchuken Tavern
Congratulations!
A gift of fried pork from the Tonchuken Missus!
And I'll sing for you, too.
Poor singer that you are!
Why, thank you, Missus!
Your attention, please!
'All along the slopes...
'... of this mountain...
'... the scything...
'... has all been done.'
Special tonight:
A kiss for everyone!
Great! Take it off!
No!
Don't we get any of the fish with the heads on?
Yeah, where's my head?
What would you rather have?
Rotten fish or fried pork?
Fried pork and good liquor!
Shaboom!
I'm sorry, Professor!
Come out here with us.
Do you know where Shiro is?
I'm afraid not.
You don't?
Fried pork and good liquor!
Shaboom!
Shiro?
Is anyone in here?
Shiro!
What are you doing here?
Shiro! I won't let you go!
Shiro!
Sachiko!
Kinuko!
Kinuko!
I knew it!
I'm sick of being a plaything out in the middle of nowhere!
You are?
I'll kill you both!
Father! It was all my fault!
Damn you!
Stop it! He didn't do anything!
It's my fault!
Damn you!
Father!
Whore!
Shiro... keep your mouth shut.
Go back and sit down as if nothing's happened.
Ah, Professor...
Thank you. If we leave now, we can catch the last train home.
I see.
Professor!
Yukiko!
It's time to go.
SAKE! Bring more SAKE!
If it's SAKE you want,
I've got some.
And who would you be?
A relative of someone unlucky enough to end up here.
I came to help celebrate.
How about a drink?
It's not poisoned, is it?
How can you say such a thing!
I'll gladly drink some to show you it isn't.
I'll have some.
Allow me.
'And with the dusk...
'... will come death...
'... even to those safe in their homes.
'Tonight they lay their heads...
'... on their pillows...
'... but when morning comes... '
If you will permit,
I'll test this for poison.
Well, one final drink.
Cheers!
Tamura!
Shiro! The Yajimas jumped in front of the train!
Shiro!
Tamura! You bastard!
You killed my son Kyoichi!
You pushed Yoko off that bridge!
I know everything!
I know everything!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
They gave us...
...fish that were caught dead!
Shiro...
Tamura!
Where is this?
Here?
This is the river to Hell, the border of life and death.
The 'Sanzu no Kawa'.
You and I, together...
...are going to Hell!
Shiro! Can you hear it?
That crying?
Listen... there's a baby crying...
It's calling you!
Is it calling me?
Why? Why is it calling me?
Tamura, tell me!
Why is it calling me? Tamura!
Where am I?
I am the great King Enma!
Lord of the Eight Hells of Fire and the Eight Hells of Ice.
I am judge of the sins of all who pass into this underworld...
...and he who passes sentence for those wrongs.
Shiro Shimizu! Recall your multitude of sins!
Look into this magic mirror!
You hit me, you bastard!
You will face the torment of the Eight Great Hells!
'The first stone in the pile...
'... is for your father.
'The second stone in the pile...
'... is for your mother.
'The third stone in the pile...
'... is for your brothers and sisters at home.
'By day you play alone, piling up stones.
'By night the demons come to knock them down.
'When at last your pile is done it will turn to the Bodhisattva Jizo...
'... come to carry you away to paradise.'
A baby's crying...
It's calling me!
Where's it coming from?
Where am I?
The 'Sai no Kawara'...
...the bank of the river of death, where children are punished...
...for the sin of dying before their parents.
Yukiko!
Shiro!
Yukiko!
Forgive me!
It's the same as if
I'd killed you myself.
The baby's crying!
The baby we made.
Our child?
I meant to tell you that night.
The crash killed our child along with me.
Yukiko!
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
Give our child a name.
It's a girl.
The poor thing needs a name!
Can I name her?
We'll call her 'Harumi'.
The characters for 'spring' and for 'beauty'.
It's a pretty name...
'Harumi'...
'Harumi'?
Harumi!
So we had a child...
Oh, no!
I couldn't raise a child alone.
I put her on a lotus leaf in the river.
She'll be swept away!
She'll be swept away!
Hurry and save her!
Harumi!
Harumi!
Harumi!
I can't go any further.
You stay with her!
Yukiko! We go together! Forever!
The baby's being swept away...
Put my grave right next to yours.
Where a father and mother should be.
Shiro!
Yukiko!
Yukiko!
Harumi!
Harumi!
Here meet the Six Destinies.
You who dwell no more in the Three Worlds of time...
...must wander lost on these six roads...
...for your sins in the world of the living.
Harumi!
Would you know where my child's gone?
Professor!
Mrs Yajima!
Shimizu!
We had a child!
Where's she been carried away to?
My daughter...
Yukiko!
Professor... Mrs Yajima...
...forgive me.
If not for me, none of us would be...
...in this misery.
Forgive me!
Give back my daughter!
Fumi! Stop that!
Shimizu... we've fallen into Hell, too.
Professor!
Yukiko's death drove my wife mad.
We chose to die!
Professor! We meet again!
It was your fate to fall into hell.
Here's another reason why!
In Malaya, you stole a comrade's last sip of water.
You killed him.
It's true!
He's right!
That's my canteen! It's mine!
I killed a man!
Yamaguchi!
Water!
Give me water!
Water!
Water!
You who are dead... you may drink if you wish so much to do so.
This is the pus wrung out of your festering carcasses...
...and a cesspool of your foul wastes.
Drink all you wish!
You bastard! You hit me and drove away!
I'm sorry!
I'll strangle you!
Die!
Die!
Die!
Harumi!
Harumi!
You hit me and drove away!
I'm sorry. Forgive me!
Forgive me!
Spare me your excuses!
You who are dead...
This is the First Great Hell of Fire.
Here flesh is peeled, bones crushed, eyes plucked and limbs severed.
For each time you cry out in pain...
...you are returned to life to to face the torments of Hell again.
Kinuko!
You neglected your duty as a doctor.
You erred in judgment, yet felt no shame.
You were a slave to money and debauch.
You will be sawn in pieces.
A policeman serves the public.
You thought only of yourself.
An innocent man was blamed for your wrongs.
Your hands will be cut off.
You were the worst of all, immorality without limit.
Your sins are more than the stones of the 'Sai no Kawara'.
You will suffer each and every torment of Hell.
First you will be flayed.
Take me away from here, Shiro!
I loved you the minute
I saw you!
Kinuko!
Father!
Kinuko!
Whore!
No!
Let go of me!
Bitch!
Father!
Shiro!
You come with me.
You will dwell with me in this dark hell forever.
No! I want to live!
My baby's crying!
She's calling me!
Are you still lost?
You're a fool.
Loving someone...
...and suffering for them... what's the point of that now?
You meant to sell me out for those things...
...and for them you committed one sin after another!
Because you were there!
Because you took me with you!
Do you really think you can escape from Hell?
Try it, then!
This is the Lake of Blood...
...the lake into which fall those guilty of immorality...
...adultery, lust, license and lechery.
Shiro!
Shiro!
I won't let you go!
I won't let you go!
Let go!
Shiro! Shiro!
Yukiko! Harumi!
Shiro!
Help me!
Yukiko! Harumi!
Shiro!
Yukiko! Harumi!
Sachiko!
Sachiko! Sachiko!
Father!
Shiro!
Mother!
Shiro!
Shiro!
Sachiko!
Shiro!
Sachiko!
Sachiko!
Shiro!
I can't see anything!
Have I gone blind?
Sachiko!
Have you seen my father?
Your father?
I think I saw him...
...but where?
Why are you suffering, Shiro?
If only we'd met sooner in life...
Now it's all too late.
It's not! I'm going to live!
You're right. It's not too late.
Even now you want her.
There's still time.
Put your arms around her!
Kiss her! Then you'll be one of Hell's vermin!
Just like me!
No! You mustn't!
Mother!
Shiro! You're about to make love to your sister!
Your younger sister!
Sachiko, Shiro's your elder brother!
These hands! The blood that flows in them is cursed!
When I went to live with your father...
...I was already pregnant with Ensai's child.
Ito!
So Shiro is my son?
Yes.
All these years I've lied to you both.
Ito!
This was all your fault, Gozo.
If only I'd known!
I wouldn't have ended up a drunken derelict!
This is fun! I like you guys more all the time!
Let's go.
Shiro!
'Big Brother'... wait!
Sachiko!
Your baby... hurry and save your baby!
I hear her!
Shiro!
Wherever you go, you go with me!
You can't escape me!
What do you want my brother to do, Mr Tamura?
You're a demon!
You're the very spirit of death!
Leave us alone!
That's right. I'm a demon.
The very spirit of death.
Shiro! Come with me!
Leave my brother alone!
Shiro...
You come with me!
Come on.
Tamura! You have sold the most beautiful thing a man has.
You have given your conscience over to evil!
Those who sign away their conscience...
...suffer all the torments of bottomless Hell.
Shiro!
Harumi!
Harumi!
Shiro! Shiro! Help me!
Harumi!
It hurts!
Hear me!
You who in life piled sin upon sin...
...will never leave this lowest depth of Hell!
Suffer! Suffer!
This vortex of torment goes on forever!
Harumi!
Harumi!
Help me!
Help me!
Harumi!
Harumi!
Shiro!
Harumi!
Harumi!
Harumi!
Save me!
Harumi!
Shiro!
Save your child now, or she must do endless penance in Hell.
This is the last chance you are given.
Harumi!
Harumi!
Hell! This is Hell! This is Hell!
Harumi!
Harumi!
Shiro!
Harumi!
Shiro!
Yukiko!
Shiro! Save Harumi!
Yukiko!
Shiro!
Brother!
'A life...
'... is merely...
'... two-score years and ten... '
Harumi!
Harumi!
Shiro!
Brother!

RAJOMON GATE
Who are you?
A wandering spectre out so late at night?
No, no, I am no such thing
I am returning from Nobleman
Fujiwara's mansion...
...but I am afraid...
...of the bamboo grove ahead
It is dangerous at night with highwaymen and robbers
Please help me
Will you see me to the end of the grove?
What if I were a robber?
A fine samurai could not be a robber
Are you one of the distinguished Raiko's...
...renowned warriors?
Please help me
Very well
It's out of my way and late already, but a little delay won't matter
Thank you
Woman
You're very fast
It is a familiar road
A cat?
What is it?
There you are. I wondered where you'd gone
I heard a cat
Nothing to be afraid of
My heart is pounding
They are starving too
At the Kamo River bed...
...crows peck at the bodies of those who starved to death
Thank you
It's a secluded place
We have nothing to offer you...
...but I would be happy if you came inside
Well , let me see...
Mother and I live alone
Shall I accept your kindness, then?
Please do
This way, please
A fine residence
Much better than my home
Like a nobleman's abode
Is anything wrong?
It seems cold
We only use it...
...when we have guests
I think your being here...
...will soon fill the room with warmth
Strange things happen in a war-torn land
Hail fell in Summer
Then it became so hot, birds fell from the sky
My mother
Thank you for being so kind to my daughter
Not at all , I enjoyed the night breeze while I saw her home
I have a feeling we've met somewhere
You're joking!
Isn't he, Mother?
I believe we have but
I cannot recall where
Serve him sake
A cat?
A homeless stray cat
Please have some more
Excuse me, but how old are you?
What?
I also have a son
He is about your age
I am twenty-two
My husband is twenty-one
Where is he?
Serving the Emperor?
He went to war
To war?
Yes, three years ago.
He has not returned
Who is his leader?
We do not know
We had planted
Spring seeds
Seeds?
Yes
We must plant seeds in an age of war to keep from starving
Suddenly , soldiers passed by
My son was taken, plough still in his hands
Do not worry
He'll be a successful samurai somewhere by now
Somewhere?
Far away to the north in Ezo or south in Tsukushi
The whole land is up in arms
He must be so great he has no time to come home
Don't worry. He was lucky to be taken to war
It's a samurai's world now!
Noblemen cannot fight
So the samurai will rule the land
The time will come when even the Mikado must yield to our leader
I used to be a farmer, too
But since the war,
I've risen to this
Do not worry
Wars keep us in food and everything else
Everything is ours for the taking
Your mother?
She is being tactful
I am drunk. It is very good sake
Please make yourself at home
I am glad you came
It's good sake
Please feel at home
Excuse me
RAJOMON GATE
An official is coming!
You are Raito Minamoto, the leader of the samurai
It is not like you at all
Are you doing nothing about the spectre that appears at Rajomon Gate?
Samurai means men who are proud of being strong warriors
The spectre may well appear at any time in the Palace
I cannot sleep peacefully at night
He told me in his august voice:
I cannot sleep peacefully at night"
Who's running all over the land fighting?
It's me, Raiko Minamoto!
In the Palace, they kick balls, play games
They write songs and love women
Don't say I said this
It's frustrating
The monster's not a supernatural being
Just an animal or night-prowler!
Call Kintoki!
He went west with his troops
Call Tsuna Watanabe!
He took his troops east
Fool! I know that!
I'm just trying to stiffen your morale !
Is there anyone who will kill the monster?
EZO, NORTHERN JAPAN
You cut off
Kumasunehiko's head?
Let me see it
Is it really his head?
He told me so himself !
He wore fine armour and had an iron club
Good! It's really Kumasunehiko's head. It's a great prize
General Takemaro Fujiwara?
He died in battle !
My army of two thousand men?
They all died.
The enemy too!
Give me a detailed account of it!
It was all muddy.
Rushes grew there
The enemy lured us into the rushes!
The battle began at dawn and ended at night!
He and I were alone by then
He was hairy all over like a bear! I was frightened!
Kumasunehiko, I thought!
I was right! He told me so!
He asked my name.
I was going to say "Gintoki"...
Too simple , so I tacked on Yabu and said I was Yabu-no-Gintoki
He said my name sounded strong
Asking me if I were a general he challenged me to a fight
Was he strong! Like Atlas given an iron club!
I thought his club would kill me!
I didn't want to die, so I fought!
I finally cut off his head!
I will call you
Yabu-no-Gintoki
I will add you to my big "Four".
My big "Five" now
Jimbei, it's me!
I'm Hachi, Yone's son
You're...
What happened? My home's burned!
My home's gone!
Yes, you're Hachi all right
Your clothes?
Never mind that!
What about my home?
My mother and wife?
It was last Summer.
Kyoto burned for three days and nights
Conquerors and conquered alike burned things
Fires everywhere in war
Sparks fell even here
We fled into the mountains
When we came back your home had burned. It was just ashes
Did your mother and wife burn to death or run away...?
We haven't seen them since
We don't know how the house burned down
Mother! Oshigi!
Where did you go?
You've won great distinction
Your valour is known all over the capital
Even beggars say you're a strong samurai
Yes, young girls especially make much of him
They hope for a glimpse of him
The bravest man in the capital must act accordingly
My orders:
Get rid of the monster that kills samurai by biting necks
Do not fail since it will affect my prestige
I offer you my cup
Pour for him
How about women, Gintoki?
Do you think they're beautiful
Yes, I do
Very well
When you have killed the monster,
I will give you a woman
Any you want...so don't fail
What is the matter?
Afraid to walk alone at night?
Are you passing through the dark grove beyond here?
So am I.
I will see you home
Thank you
Thank you
This is your home?
Yes
I live with my mother
My home's far away yet.
May I rest a bit?
Will you let me rest?
Welcome
It was nice of you to come
Please
Are your names Yone and
Shige, by any chance?
Excuse me if I were rude
You look exactly like my mother and wife but are dressed differently
Where are they?
Three years ago, I was taken east by the army to fight
I was working in the fields
I left my mother and wife
I wanted to return to my mother and wife, so I fought as hard as I could
I could not die
I made a name for myself instead
Leader Raiko named me
Yabu-no-Gintoki
But when I went home, my house was gone
My mother and wife were gone too
It's very strange
You two look exactly like my mother and wife
I do not know where they are
But just as you fought day and night in order to see them...
...your mother and wife must have waited for you too, day and night
You have returned a fine man
I wonder what has happened to them
My home was at the edge of a bamboo grove
About here
How long have you lived here?
For three years
After I left for war?
Yes, I think so.
Is there a reason you are living in such a lonely place?
A poor mother and daughter, we live quietly and inconspicuously
If you came three years ago, did you see my house?
If not, the charred ruins?
Who are you?
Reveal your true selves!
Monsters!
Why have you taken the image of my mother and wife?
RAJOMON GATE
Woman!
Are you here?
Woman! Come out if you are here!
Where are you, woman?
I did not come to kill you!
I came to see you!
Woman!
Are you here?
Are you here?
You must want to see him
I want to see my son too
Our vow is to kill samurai and suck their blood
So we invoked the evil gods
If only he were not a samurai...
I beg you...
Bear it
Endure it
Be content to see him...secretly
It's him!
Are you here?
Are you here?
Where are you?
What has happened to you?
You're here?
It is nice of you to come
We have nothing to offer you
But permit us to celebrate your safe return home
Serve him
I will not ask you who you are
I just wanted to see you, so I came
You look like my mother
You look like my wife
This is enough for me
I am glad to see you again.
I missed you
We also wished to see you
It will not be dawn for a long time
Please relax and be comfortable
I missed you
You have a cat?
No, it is a stray cat without an owner
That reminds me. When I was taken to war we had a black kitten at home
Never mind. I will forget about my home
Excuse me
It will be dawn soon
Please leave before then
I will come again
Will you wait?
Returning empty-handed every night...seen the monster?
Yes, I saw it but...
Why didn't you kill it?
It's...
You couldn't?
No...
You look bad
You look like a monster yourself
Have you been bewitched by the monster?
Your breast, your legs are like Shige's
You are Shige
You are my wife
Shige, you are good enough to eat
I'll chew you up and make you part of me!
Hold me tighter!
More! More!
There you are
Where is she?
She is not here anymore
What? Not here?
Why? What happened to her?
She was permitted to see you and love you for seven days
Please count and see
Last night was the seventh
She shortened her life to seven days...
...to pledge her love to you
Are you not living human beings?
So how could she shorten her life for seven days?
I know not what you are!
Evil gods or ghosts- supernatural powers can make you look human?
So you could not die!
She could not die!
I want to see her once more
Bound by a vow, I cannot tell you who we are
We promised the evil gods
Gods of hate who wander between this and the netherworld
Promising revenge by sucking blood, we took human forms
She broke her promise
Our love?
Yes
You are my mother!
She's my wife!
Tell me who killed you!
We promised
So we cannot reveal what we are or why we became like this
What did you promise?
To suck the blood of samurai
To suck the blood of all samurai
You too, are one
Instead of killing you...
...she gave herself to you
So she fell headlong into hell
She was glad to
Can I not see her anymore?
Is she gone?
Instead of sucking hateful samurai blood...
...she preferred to love you and go to hell
Hateful...?
Tell me why!
If only I could...
Bound by a vow,
I cannot tell you
Forgive me
Mother!
What happened to you?
You saw the monster?
If you saw it, I should think you'd destroy it
I'll take that up later
Tell me what the monster was like
Vengeful ghosts murdered by samurai
So they hate samurai and suck their blood
The ghost told you that?
Fool
We fight so nobles and the masses can live without worry!
So how can anyone hate us?
Nobles may benefit from it...
...but the fleeing farmers starve to death!
They are weak!
The weak always starve!
We risk our lives to fight -it needs courage!
Isn't that why everyone respects us?
Take yourself !
A farmer’s son once, but Gintoki now!
Who'd respect or think a farmer to be a human being?
A samurai, so women make much of you!
No ghost is going to hate us!
No ghosts can make fools of us!
With a samurai's authority
I order you...
...destroy it!
One has been destroyed
What? One has been destroyed?
How many were there?
Two
You destroyed one?
The proof?
Well ?
It will never appear again
Tell me why
It disappeared!
There was nothing I could do!
It disappeared from my sight!
One more left?
Yes!
Destroy it
- Let someone else...!
- Fool
If this one gets away...
...I will kill you
It is to uphold my samurai honour!
RAJOMON GATE
Why did you not go away?
You sucked blood every night? Why?
Why can't you rest in peace?
I wished to see you
I wished to see you just once more
I have lost my honour and will be killed!
I have been driven to the point where I must destroy you or die!
After seeing you, I was ready to follow her to hell
Satisfied now that you have seen me?
Please come to my abode
Will you read the sutra to me there?
Then I can rest in peace
Please. I have an edifying sutra
If you read it, my deep-rooted grudges will fade away
A puddle . Please be careful
What is it?
It's nothing
Something...?
It was a black cat?
I think so
Didn't you just pick it up?
Cat's legs aren't just lying around!
Don't be angry.
Just a thought
Why would a cat hate samurai?
They said demons appeared on
Mount Oe so I went for the Mikado
There are no demons
It was Shutendoji, a bandit
No glory in killing a bandit, so I said a demon
Now, you've destroyed a cat as big as a cow and one thousand years old
To purify yourself, pray for seven days
It's important to make it the talk of the capital
Do it grandiosely .
Purification. Prayers
Mother
Are you a cat?
Are you my mother?
Return it to me
Return it to me
Return it to me
Mother! Are you a cat or a ghost?
My mother couldn't be
Mother! Please come out!
If you are my mother, please come out!
The sword that protects you...
...is in the way
Mother, please rest in peace!
I cut off your arm, thinking an apparition had taken your form!
Take the sword away
Return my arm to me
What will you do then?
My arm is my weapon
Without it, I cannot suck the blood of samurai
Will you wander forever as a vengeful ghost, Mother?
Yes, I will
For the hate I bear the samurai
For warring samurai
Excuse me...
Excuse me...
Who is it?
Please open the door
Tonight ends the seventh day of solitary purification
I cannot open it until dawn
I know that very well
I am a medium in charge of divination at the Imperial Palace
I cannot break the rules for anyone
The Mikado is very troubled about you
Tonight is the last night
So evil spirits may appear to thwart your plans
The Mikado sent me here...
I am to seal them in so that you may complete your seven day duty
Inform the Mikado...
...that I am a match for any evil spirit!
You do not understand at all
Disobey him...
...and not only you but your leader...
...will be punished too
It will only take a little while
Please open the door
Just a little while then
Excuse me for calling so late at night
Is that the arm you cut off the ghost?
Please divine or purify the room
No, no, I cannot go near it
You offered it to your god there
I divine by the positive...
...and negative principles
Please show me the arm more closely
Please be so good as to bring the arm to me
Very troublesome
May I take it in my hand?
Please do
Your left arm?
I have it back!
Mother!
Spectre!
Mother!
Mother!

MARIO BAVA
What's got into you?
Why did you come here?
Don't you realise that Isabella could see us?
- Have you got any?
- No.
I can't take this any more.
If I don't get some soon
I'll go crazy.
Don't be like that, Franco.
Have you tried asking lsabella?
We had an argument.
She even stole what I had, damn her.
Try to hang on in there.
When I've finished work we'll find some.
Trust me. I'll help you.
Now go.
I'm counting on you.
Thanks. I'll be waiting.
Bye.
Isabella.
Your scarf.
Thank you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
What's wrong?
The sign's fallen off again.
- Do you want me to go and fix it?
- No, not tonight.
You can do it in the morning.
Same old story...
Isabella's late again.
I don't know what's wrong with that girl.
This is the third time.
There's no need to get angry, just give her a hefty fine. l certainly will, and I'll fire her if she's as late as she was yesterday.
- Good night, Madame.
- Good night.
Nicole.
Look at this dress.
Try to take more care of the clothes.
There's another show tomorrow.
Look at this.
- I'Il be more careful. sorry.
- You're always rushing off out of here.
You're all the same, that's all you think about.
What does she expect? she's so annoying.
It's not easy being a widow.
Isabella!
No, thanks.
- How Iong were the lights off?
- Ten minutes.
How long had the girl worked for you?
About two years.
What was she like?
Very lively.
A bit unruly, but there's nothing bad I couId say about her.
As far as you know, did she have a lot of friends?
Inspector,
I'm not going to be much help here.
I'm the managing director.
You should ask the two girls who lived with her.
I can't believe it. Such a terrible thing.
I still can't get my head round it.
Poor thing, she was always so cheerful, so...
Come on, stop crying.
It's not going to do any good.
Inspector silvestri, this is Countess
Cristiana, the owner of the company.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Haven't I met you before, madam?
Or am l mistaken?
Yes, we have actually met before.
Because of my husband's accident.
Exactly.
It was a car accident.
I imagine you'Il be able to help me.
You must know alI about your girls.
Inspector, this isn't a boarding school. l don't know or care about what they do when they're not here.
All right,
I'm going to be in the studio.
- Will you excuse me?
- Of course.
Come on, Peggy.
Stop crying.
What good is it going to do?
Come on.
What time was it when you went out to fix the sign?
About seven. It was banging and the noise was irritating Madame Cristiana.
I went out and fixed it as best I could.
I protest!
Mr Morlachi,
I demand an expIanation.
I'd only just come through the gates when these men grabbed me.
- Ask the inspector.
- Inspector?
Calm down and tell me why you're here.
- I'm Marquis Riccardo MorelIi...
- All right, but answer my question.
He's come to pick me up.
He's my fiancé.
Fiancé!
- Why are you laughing?
- Because we live together.
Did you know Isabella?
Isabella?
You introduced us once, didn't you?
Yes, I guess I knew her, but only by sight.
I see.
Come on, Peggy.
Be strong.
Stop crying. lt looks like she's the only one who's upset.
They were very good friends.
- Did she live with you two?
- Yes.
Who had she gone out with?
Who was the last person to see her?
I don't know.
Leave her alone. Everybody knows who Isabella's lover was.
- Who are you?
- Cesare Lazzarini, fashion designer.
- Will you tell me his name?
- Whose?
The lover's.
Scalo. Franco scalo, the famous antique dealer.
- Police. Where's the inspector?
- ln there.
I can assure you
I don't know anything.
- Excuse me a second.
- sure.
It's confirmed.
ShalI I go?
- Yes, go.
- All right.
So...
Tell me, what kind of relationship did you have with Isabella?
- We were friends.
- Or lovers?
I'm going to admit to something, but you mustn't be shocked. l don't believe in permanent and everlasting relationships.
I understand.
Do you know what this is?
No, I don't.
- What is it?
- Cocaine.
It was found in your friend Isabella's house.
In Isabella's house?
- so you didn't know about this?
- No.
Never mind.
But I must ask you to remain at my disposal.
I'll see you again.
Autumn Evening.
Turn around.
AlI right, you can go.
Quickly.
- What's wrong, Cesaretto?
- lsabella was supposed to model this.
- You're right.
- Who should I give it to?
Let's see...
- Peggy...
- Not me, please. I can't.
For heaven's sake don't cry or you'Il ruin your make-up.
- Greta, you model it.
- No, l'm sorry, I can't wear it.
- Don't be silIy.
- lt'll bring me bad luck.
- someone's going to have to model it.
- l will.
Good. Come on, hurry up.
Why doesn't that surprise me? she's so cynical.
AlI right, you can go.
Turn round. Good. Walk.
Hold on a second.
Something's missing.
The brooch!
The green brooch.
We can fix that now.
Where is it?
Isabella brought her own.
She kept it in one of these boxes.
Here it is.
Look what l've found.
Isabella kept a diary.
It'll be an interesting read.
Listen. "He's a man who arouses deep and desperate feelings in me.
"I'd be prepared to die for him."
Let me see.
- I don't think we've got the right...
- What are you doing? Are you all mad?
Does this seem like the right time?
Go on, off you go. Get ready.
I think we should give this to the police.
I found it and I'd like to hand it in myself, if you don't mind.
As you wish.
Ray of MoonIight.
- Ηello?
- HeIlo. Hello, Franco.
Why didn't you come?
I was on my way out but I'm not feeling well. You know why.
Sure, I understand.
Try to come right away.
I've got some.
Listen, Franco.
I've found a diary.
- lsabella's diary.
- What?
Isabella's diary?
Who else knows about it?
Everybody, unfortunately. l realised too late that there could be something compromising about you in it.
I kept it and said I'd hand it in to the police.
Good. We'll have time to take a look at it.
- I'll come straight over.
- You don't sound well at all, Franco.
Franco!
Franco, can you hear me?
Yes, Nicole.
Sorry, I can't even breathe. But now you've got some I'll feel better. Bye.
I'll see you soon.
Hurry up, girIs.
Greta, you're on next.
- Everything all right there, Marco?
-Yes, Madame.
- Cesaretto, where were you?
- I'm here.
I looked everywhere for you.
Why do I have to do everything myseIf?
- Nicole?
- What is it?
Telephone call.
- For me?
- Yes, for you.
- Hello?
- Hello. Nicole, is that you?
- Yes. Who's speaking?
- It's Franco.
I can't make it over there.
I feel too ill.
You come over. Please. Now.
I feel like I'm suffocating.
How am I supposed to get away?
AlI right, I'll do my best.
I'll try to come right away.
There, it's all right now.
Peggy, Franco's sick.
He needs me.
I need to rush over and see him.
Will you lend me your car?
But the show's not over yet.
I don't care. Give me the keys but don't let anyone see you.
Hold on.
- Peggy, what are you doing?
- Nothing, just getting my handkerchief.
The alarm switch is hidden in the gIove compartment.
AlI right.
Thank you.
ANTIQUEs
Franco?
- Have fun but don't come home too late.
- Don't worry.
Marco!
I want to keep you company till Tao-Li gets back.
Aren't you scared of being at home on your own?
I'm actually very tired and I'd like to go straight to bed.
But you'lI have to stay up till Nicole brings your car back.
PIease.
AlI right. As you wish.
Come in.
Thank you.
I didn't want to leave you.
I'd have worried about you being alone in that house.
- Clarice, are you still here?
- Good evening, miss.
Yes, I've only just finished.
Didn't Miss Τao-Li come back with you?
She's gone to a party. she'll be home Iater.
Clarice Iooks after us.
I'll be off, then. I left your dinner in the oven to keep it warm.
If Miss Tao-Li wants her concoction, it's ready. she just needs to heat it up.
Thank you, Clarice.
Good night. l'll see you tomorrow.
Good night.
Peggy...
- You always refuse to Iisten to me.
- I listen to you.
You don't. And I'm tired of telling you the same thing over and over.
I've told you a thousand times.
Sadly I've fallen in love with you.
But you don't care.
Why not?
Calm down and come here.
You see...
I'm not well.
I know you think I'm besotted, and that drives me insane.
I'm sick, unhappy...
Don't be like that. l understand you.
I'm your friend. Come on, cheer up.
- l'll have one of your cigarettes.
- No! stop! Leave it.
What is it? I just wanted a cigarette.
What have I done?
I'll get it for you.
You'lI mess up my bag otherwise.
Here.
Hello?
Good evening, it's Inspector silvestri.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm calling about your car.
We found it unlocked and abandoned.
Had it been stolen?
No, I lent it to my friend Nicole.
Yes.
Yes, she asked to borrow it so she couId visit a friend who wasn't well.
Has something happened?
I'd rather speak to you about this in person.
I'll come over to your house.
AlI right, I'll be here.
What's going on?
They've found my car but not Nicole.
Oh, God, what's happened to her?
- Is the inspector coming?
- Yes, he wants to speak to me.
I'll be off, then. I'd rather the police didn't find me with you.
Yes, it's best if nobody knows you came here.
Yes, it is best.
Especially for you.
- I'm sorry.
- l'll see you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
"I caught Peggy trying to steal
1 00,000 lire from my bag.
"She started crying and told me she needed it.
"She's pregnant but can't deal with the scandal.
"I lent her the money because I felt sorry for her.
"Tomorrow I'll ask the bastard for 200,000 lire."
WHERE Is THE DIARY?
I burnt it...
I burnt it...
I burnt it!
Miss Peggy?
Good evening.
Sorry, I know it's late for visiting, but this is an urgent matter.
Don't worry.
PIease, have a seat.
What's it about?
Charles, you can go.
I got back a short while ago and found Nicole in my shop... murdered.
My God!
I'd gone to the studio to pick Nicole up.
Remember?
We bumped into each other.
I looked everywhere but I couldn't find her.
So I went back home.
Believe me,
I'll never forget what I saw.
Sorry, but why did you come here instead of going to the poIice?
Nicole was my friend.
She was kiIled in my shop.
The poIice are bound to blame me.
I need an alibi.
- You've got to help me.
- Me? What have I got to do with this?
You're in as much trouble as I am.
We need to say that we were together at the studio until we left.
I'll vouch for you and you'll vouch for me.
- lt's in both of our interests.
- You're insane.
The poIice have no reason to suspect me.
You're the one who's in a fix.
Maybe you really did kill her.
No. Call the police right now or I'll do it.
Go on, then, and you can tell them about the lOUs.
What lOUs?
The IOUs you signed to guarantee a seven million lire loan for lsabella that you couldn't pay.
Is that true?
Riccardo, you didn't telI me. Is it true?
Oh, my God.
My dear Marquis, you haven't got a penny to your name.
You're compIetely ruined and afraid of the scandal.
That's a pretty good reason to kill Isabella and maybe Nicole too, to make sure the police didn't get hold of the diary.
Who knows, maybe all the expiry dates were written in it.
What diary?
I don't know anything about it.
Don't lie, Riccardo. I told you
Nicole had found Isabella's diary.
As you can see, we're tied to each other by a strong thread.
If you don't want the police sticking their noses into your business, you'd better do as l say.
I'll go back to my shop now and call the inspector.
I'll tell him that we were together all the time. All right?
Good night.
Why won't you believe me?
I burnt that diary. lt contained things about me that I didn't want people to know.
I burnt it.
I swear I burnt it.
Believe me.
Believe me!
No!
How did that girl get in here?
- she had a key.
- How come?
I'd given it to her.
- she used to visit me sometimes.
- Her as well?
You mustn't think that I...
I'd left IsabelIa for Nicole.
How many other people had keys to that door?
Nobody else.
- Except me, of course.
- Of course.
Did you take drugs with her too?
- What are you saying, Inspector?
- Come on, scaIo!
Who are you trying to kid?
You've got a drug habit.
It's written all over your face.
I can even teIl you where you get your drugs.
And... as for the girls who, shall we say, keep you company, or who try to fight your habit, like lsabella did, or who take drugs themselves,
Iike this one...
That may welI be the case, but it doesn't mean that I'm a murderer.
Besides, I have an alibi. l was with...
I haven't asked you about that... yet.
We'll talk about it in good time.
- When?
- Right now, in my office.
- Do you recognise it?
- Yes, that's the one.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Hold on. l wrote down the first few numbers.
Here we go... 4, 5, 3.
What did I teIl you?
Did you see if a man or a woman was driving?
A man, definitely.
He was all in black and he didn't seem to have a face.
Maybe he was wearing a mask.
Maybe, l don't know. I looked at him because l heard a horn.
- What horn?
- The car horn, Inspector.
It beeped, but not for very long.
Then suddenly it stopped.
Could there be an alarm connected to the horn, Zanchin?
Hold on, I'll check.
Yes, there is one. It's at the back of the gIove compartment.
- How Iong did it beep for?
- I don't know.
- Not very long, like I said.
- Tell me how long.
That's it.
Pretty much that long.
If you didn't know where it was, you'd take a while to find it.
Right.
But if you did know where it was hidden, you'd only need a few seconds.
Come through.
After you.
Have a good look at these men.
Did you ever see any of them in Miss Peggy's car?
- HeIlo, Mr Morlachi.
- Hello, Clarice.
You know him?
You've seen him in the car?
Of course she's seen me.
In the car and walking, Iots of times.
All perfectly normal.
I didn't say it wasn't.
Let's keep going.
- Him. l saw him in the car.
- Of course. Big deal.
What's the point of this?
It's all a farce.
Be quiet.
You didn't just see me, did you?
Open your eyes, you idiot.
Him, for instance.
You saw him too, didn't you?
Do you only want to know who went in the car with Miss Peggy?
Why?
Because that gentleman came to the house last night.
He came with Miss Peggy.
At Iast we're getting somewhere.
You bastard! What are you trying to insinuate? Do you want to ruin me?
That's enough.
Bloody murderer!
Damn you!
Own up to it. You're the murderer.
Inspector, have him examined.
He's impotent.
That's why he hates women. He'd kill them aIl because he can't have them.
Why don't you tell the inspector that that's why your wife left you?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I'm suffocating.
- HoId his shoulders.
- Calm down.
Take him to the infirmary.
No!
Let me go!
Let me go!
- None of you knew he had epilepsy?
- I didn't know.
You can go.
Goodbye, Clarice.
I'm very sorry but I'm going to have to keep you here, Mr Morlachi, and you too, Mr Lazzarini.
- What does "keep you here" mean?
- It means l'm legally detaining you.
Excuse me, lnspector, but you need a good reason to do that.
Nicole's murderer had been in Peggy's car before because he knew where the alarm switch was hidden.
- Can I go?
- Can I?
No, you'll stay here too.
This is absurd.
I've provided an alibi.
- The marquis confirmed it.
- lt's true. We were together.
Don't worry, gentlemen,
I haven't forgotten.
You were together until gone 1 1 .
Nicole was kiIled after 1 0.
- so why do you need us?
- Well...
When I called Peggy to tell her that we'd found her car, it was about half past 1 1 .
I got to her place a quarter of an hour later, but she was no longer there and the house was in a complete mess.
Maybe they killed her too and hid her body somewhere.
As far as this last event is concerned, gentlemen,
I'd say your aIibi was pretty useless.
It's already nine o'clock.
Why do we have to sit in the dark?
As if we weren't scared enough already.
Do what you want, but try to stay calm.
How can we stay calm?
Aren't you worried about everything that's happened?
I'm scared too, I admit it.
But there's no point in panicking.
I wish some of the men would come back.
We're the only ones left at the studio.
Hello?
Mr Morlachi, at last.
What's happened?
What?
That's ridiculous. Why?
What right do they have?
Oh, yes.
I see.
AlI right.
Of course.
Yes, don't worry.
AlI right.
- They've detained all five of them.
- Why?
Clearly the police believe that one of them is the murderer.
I knew it.
Madame... can we go?
Yes, please go.
Be strong.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I really envy those three living together.
At Ieast they can keep each other company.
- l'm going too, Madame.
- Yes, of course.
Wait... Why don't you come and sleep at my house tonight?
What?
I just live round the corner.
Why should I go all the way to yours out in the country?
I could come and sleep at your house, then.
No, I'm sorry, but I'd rather be on my own.
And I think you'd feel even more afraid at my house.
Aren't you scared on your own?
They lived with you.
Isabella's been killed, and Peggy...
Yes, I know.
But I'm certain that nothing will happen tonight.
AlI the men have been detained and I'm sure one of them is the murderer.
- Good night, Madame.
- Good night.
Madame, I don't want to go home, l want to sleep here.
No, my dear. You need to go
Iike the others. Good night.
But I'm frightened.
I live out of town in a house on its own.
Don't be a baby, Greta.
We've got a big day tomorrow.
Work must go on.
Listen...
Isabella and Nicole were mixed up in a nasty business that doesn't concern us.
We've got nothing to be frightened of.
Do you understand?
Off you go.
Don't worry.
- Good night, Madame.
- Good night.
Good night.
Miss...
Miss, the marquis called to say that something came up and he's stuck in town.
I know.
Can you make me some tea, please?
Right away, miss.
Hello? Hello?
I've brought your tea, miss.
Just a moment, please.
Come in.
Leave it up there, Charles. l can do it myself.
Good night, miss.
Did you see how the murderer attacked that poor girl?
He must have used a red-hot iron.
We're dealing with a madman here.
Or a homicidal sex maniac.
- Who only kills beautiful girIs.
- Exactly.
Perhaps female beauty makes him lose his head and kill.
We're going to have to start again from scratch. lnspector, Forensics are outside if you want to see the footprints in the garden.
The footprints start over there.
The murderer drove up here on this road, got out and walked down the slope to the house.
Τhe prints match the ones found in the studio gardens.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, we took casts of them.
I could have sworn the culprit was one of the five men we detained.
- We'll have to reIease them at once.
- Of course.
This time they reaIly do have a cast-iron alibi.
And I provided them with it.
Riccardo Morelli.
Make sure everything's there.
Massimo Morlachi.
Come in.
Mr Morlachi, I'd Iike to speak to you for a moment if I may.
Yes, dear. Come in.
Mr Morlachi, I'm a caIm woman, l'm not at all nervous.
But I find the thought of a sex maniac prowIing around our studio really very disturbing.
I've decided to take some holiday.
I've booked a seat on the flight to Paris tomorrow.
Paris?
- All right, Tao-Li.
- Thank you.
By the way, are you still living in the countess's house?
- Yes. Why?
- Nothing. Just memories.
When the count was alive
I'd often go and visit them.
It's a beautifuI house.
I remember being able to see all over Rome from the terrace.
Yes, but right now
I'd rather see the rooftops of Paris.
- l don't doubt that. Have fun.
- Goodbye. search as much as you like. I burnt everything that could compromise you.
When I heard you'd been arrested
I got rid of Peggy's body.
They couId have found it.
And I killed Greta to give you an alibi.
Perfect.
Perfect but horrible.
I don't know how I did it.
I'd never have thought
I'd have the strength to kill.
But I did it for you.
I can imagine what it cost you.
But tell me, how did you manage to take Peggy's body to Morelli's house?
I didn't take her there myself.
I just put her in the boot... and Greta did the rest.
Why did you decide to use Greta?
Well, l knew she'd be on her own at home.
- That made everything easier.
- Well done.
The police are convinced they're dealing with a sex maniac.
Isabella, Nicole...
Peggy... and now, with Greta, that makes four.
Stop it.
Sweetheart, what's wrong?
Kiss me.
Are you worried, darling?
What a mess. lt's all because of that stupid idiot Isabella.
Her blackmail had become unbearable.
Money, money and more money.
PreciseIy because she unfortunately found out... that my husband's death wasn't an accident, she should have realised that it was both foolish and dangerous to push it.
But no... No...
The more we gave her, the more she wanted.
- she asked for it.
- she thought she had us on a string.
She felt like she was the only witness to a perfect crime.
Her death wouId have been perfect too, if onIy that bloody diary hadn't cropped up.
But it's all over now.
We've got nothing to worry about now, darling. Nothing at aIl.
No, that's where you're wrong.
Very wrong.
The two of us will never have any peace until we give the police a culprit.
Peace!
Listen to me.
We'll never get away with it unless we put a face to their sex maniac.
UntiI they catch him they'll be watching us.
AlI the girls who were killed worked at the studio.
They've got no proof against us but the case has become a sensation.
It's all over the papers.
The scandal's raging.
We need to find a solution.
So what do you want to do?
I know, darling.
We should go away to the moon.
We need to kilI one last time.
And you'll be the one who does it.
- No.
- Yes.
They're definitely watching me.
Don't worry, darIing,
I'll create a perfect alibi for you.
Stay caIm.
No, Massimo.
You can't ask me to do a thing like that.
I refuse. l can't do it.
Do you understand?
You've done it already.
Yes, you're right,
I've done it already, but I had a very different motive then.
You were in danger.
I had no choice.
I knew that if I didn't do it
I'd have lost you forever.
My love for you gave me the strength to do it.
But it was horrible.
Horrible!
Don't cry. Listen to me.
You need to do what I say.
You have to kill Tao-Li.
You have to make it look like suicide.
Do you understand?
They'Il find the mask by her side and think that she was the culprit.
If we don't do it, everything we've done so far will have been pointless.
You're surprised to see me alive, aren't you, Massimo?
Your plan was certainly very ingenious.
It was going to be perfect, just the way you like it, but you didn't reckon on the shop awning breaking my fall.
PIease...
Be quiet.
I know very well what you'd like to say.
You'd like to deny it.
But I saw you with the jewels.
You planned everything.
Only you knew that I'd use the ledge if I was in danger.
Remember? You were the one who suggested it. It was your idea.
Cristiana,
I swear it was an accident.
Do you really still think that you can fool me?
Yes...
Yes, it was a very ingenious plan.
They'd have found me dressed like this and everything would have been clear and you'd have been free.
Now I understand why you wanted to marry me in secret and in such a hurry.
You were so in Iove with me. so in love.
You were, but with my villa, the house, the studio, my money...
You wanted to get your hands on everything I own by killing me.
Cristiana, I beg you...
You're wrong, darling.
It's not true.
It's not true.
You're imagining it all, darling.
Believe me.
I swear, Cristiana...
It was just an accident.
I didn't mean it to happen.
How could you think that?
I love you, darling, so much.
We'll go away.
We'll be together forever.
I'll never leave you.
Police...
Get me...
Get me Inspector silvestri...

Read, Rector!
Rector!
Now that you're going home, just try to stay out of mischief!
On last vacation, two seminarians, disguised as devils, were caught stealing chickens.
Zozulia and Lemesh, I mean you!
The other three had gotten a deacon drunk, and then goaded him into singing bawdy, indecent songs!
For shame!
And now, let us pray together.
Lord, let the Light of Thy wisdom shine down upon us.
And bestow on our hearts
Thy tender mercy.
Preserve us from all evil.
And Heaven and Earth will resound with glorious songs of praise.
Amen.
Be sure you return in time for the
Feast of the Immaculate Conception!
We should've spotted a farm long ago.
The devil would lose his way too, in this darkness.
- Where did the road go?
- There is no road.
Look, Khaliava, you go that way.
And I'm going over this way.
And Gorobetz...
Hey, Gorobetz!
Damn it, I took a rotten stump for your head.
- What did you find?
- Just fox-holes.
- Well, what do we do?
- Let's sing at the top of our lungs.
Quiet! I know...
Let's sleep under the stars.
No, Khaliava, that won't do.
We have to keep looking. Someone might give us a glass of vodka.
Sure, it's better than sleeping under the stars.
There's a farmhouse ahead!
Come on!
It's our last chance, brothers, to find a place to stay.
- Open up!
- Hello?
- Who is it?
- Khaliava, the theologian.
- Brutus, the philosopher.
- Gorobetz, the orator.
No, the house is full of people.
Where would I put you?
Have mercy on us, my good woman!
It's unforgivable to let Christian souls perish in the night.
- Just somewhere to sleep...
- And if we do something wrong...
All right, but each of you must sleep in a separate place.
Whatever you wish.
- Listen, good woman...
- We're ready to drop with hunger...
It's been so long since we've eaten.
There's nothing in the house to eat.
I haven't lit the stove all day.
Tomorrow we'll see that you're rewarded handsomely.
You couldn't get a crumb out of the old skinflint. The hell with her!
- Boy, I want you to come here.
- Who? Me?
You can sleep in the house.
And you, the tall one, up in the loft.
- Well, where do I stay?
- Come with me.
What do you want, granny?
No, it's the time of lent.
And not for all the gold in the world would I let you tempt me.
You're not in the flower of youth, you know.
What's wrong with you, granny?
For the love of God!
Good Lord, she's a witch!
Shameless witch!
Put me down! Let me be!
In the name of God Jesus Christ, put me down! Let me be!
If I'm not making you fly, it must be Christ, and his apostle, Thomas!
Oh, you're killing me!
Khoma!
Scat!
- What we need is tar.
- I know that.
Hey, Khoma, the Rector sent me to get you. Someone came for you.
Ah, it's you, brother Khoma.
The daughter of one of our richest Sotniks is dying.
The one who owns the estate just twenty miles outside Kiev.
Yesterday, the girl returned home, beaten almost to death.
She expressed a wish that in her final agony, the last prayers for her salvation be said by you, Khoma Brutus.
Why me? I don't even know how to do that!
Don't argue with me.
You will leave immediately.
The famous Sotnik was good enough to send his men and a wagon.
You'll have to get somebody else to go, 'cause I'm not leaving!
No one asked you if you wanted to go or not.
Thank your good master for his gift of the honey and the eggs.
And tell him I shall send the books as soon as they're ready.
And as for you, I suggest you learn to control that tongue of yours.
Otherwise, I shall have you lashed before the whole school, so you won't be able to sit down for a week.
The Lord be with you.
And with your good master.
Yavtukh, see that our friends have some vodka before they leave.
Well, don'tjust stand there.
Be off with you!
And if you know what's good for you, you'll mend your ways!
You'd better tie up the philosopher, so he won't be tempted to run off.
- Good day, my brothers.
- Good day, brother philosopher.
I've been ordered to travel in your company.
- A splendid carriage!
- Yes, a spacious one!
We could hire some musicians and dance with all the room there is.
I wonder, if it were filled with a heavy load, say you loaded up the wagon with salt or metal poles, can you tell me how many horses it would take?
It would take a lot of horses, if you have a lot of salt.
Can you tell me what sort of illness the girl is cursed with, that requires such solemn prayers to deliver her soul?
Sit down, brother philosopher.
We're not there, yet.
- Stop!
- An inn! Stop!
Whoa, girl, whoa! We're there.
Let's go in, brother philosopher.
Spirid, don't forget to water the horses.
Welcome, my friends. Please go inside.
- Do you have vodka?
- Yes, step inside.
My friends, I propose a toast to the health of the Rector.
Here's to the health of the Rector.
Drink, my good friends.
Oh, the Cossack drinks on someone else's money...
Another round!
Another round!
Serve another round!
I'd like to know one thing. Just what are you seminarians taught?
What the deacon says when he's in church, or other things?
- What a great scholar.
- I want to be a seminarian too.
Do you think I'm not clever enough?
I can learn anything!
Oh good Lord! Lord have mercy on us!
The Cossack drinks on someone else's...
- I just want to know one thing...
- Will you leave me alone, you pest?
Don't ask him.
Only God knows everything.
I just want to know what's written in those books.
- There could be other things in them.
- How can you talk that way?
- Let me go.
- Why not let him go?
Philosopher.
Don't be afraid, come here.
The master will never know.
- Don'tjust stand there. Come on.
- Let me go home, my good brothers.
Let me go home!
The young woman is dead.
The girl is dead.
Be quiet! The young woman is dead.
- The girl is dead?
- Dead? Already?
Quiet, Serko! The young woman is dead!
Why don't we let Khoma go now?
- Of course we'll let him go.
- He can do as he wants.
Leave him alone...
The young woman is dead.
Come on, you silly pig!
Brother philosopher, you're wrong to try to get out of here.
It's not the sort of place you can escape from.
You'd better go to the master.
He is waiting for you.
Why not? I would love to meet him.
It is not so much the pain of losing you, my dearest daughter, in the flower of your youth, that makes your loss more than a father can bear, as the torment I suffer at not knowing what monster was the cause of your death.
Who are you? What is your quality, and where do you come from?
From seminary. My name is
Khoma Brutus.
- And who was your father?
- I don't know.
- Your mother, then?
- I never knew her, either.
Of course, I must have had one like anyone else, but who she was, or what she was like, I never knew.
How did you make the acquaintance of my daughter?
I never met your daughter, sir.
I know nothing of girls.
I swear I've never known one.
Why did she name you, then?
Only God knows why.
The rich people fancy things that don't make sense even to a scholar.
As the saying goes: When masters fall out, their men get the clout.
You're not lying, are you, philosopher?
God strike me dead if I'm lying.
If she had lived a minute longer,
I would have known everything.
"Let no one say prayers for me, father, but send men at once to Kiev Seminary and tell them to bring here seminarian Khoma Brutus.
And let him pray for three nights for the salvation of my soul.
He knows."
And what he knows, that I hadn't time to hear.
Have you been known for your chaste life?
Could she hear about you from someone?
Me? Chaste life?
For heaven's sake, sir!
I visited a baker's wife on Maundy Thursday.
Nonetheless, she named you, that's all that counts.
As of tonight, you will start reciting the prayers for her soul.
Yes, but certainly you want to do the best thing...
Of course, anyone versed in the Scriptures could do it...
But the best thing would be to have a deacon, or even a sub-deacon.
They are well-trained and will do what's necessary.
I haven't got a suitable voice. Also,
I don't have a good appearance.
I'll do as my dear child had wanted it.
I don't care what it may cost.
You will start your vigil tonight, and recite the prayers for three nights, and I shall reward you handsomely for it. Otherwise...
How could our dear mistress abandon us?
Oh, dear child, tell us what made you leave us?
Come back! Come back, beloved!
May God the Father have mercy on her soul
May God the Son have mercy on her soul.
May God the Holy Ghost have mercy on her soul.
Give the philosopher his dinner.
Then bring him back to the church.
Tell them how the witch cast a spell on the huntsman.
It's a shame, brother philosopher, that you didn't know Mikitka.
Even his dogs adored him.
He was a fine huntsman.
Only recently he had the misfortune to fall for the young mistress.
- Either he fell in love with her...
- Or she bewitched him...
No one knows for sure.
But the man was lost.
One day the girl appeared in the stable and said:
"Mikitka, let me put my foot on you to help me onto the horse."
The poor man was so overjoyed, he said:
"I'd rather you yourself climbed onto my back."
And the fool took her onto his back, and went galloping away!
It's time we take the philosopher to where the corpse is lying.
We'll leave you now.
- Just pray in earnest.
- The best of luck to you.
Forgive us, but we must lock you up in. By order of the master.
That's all right. It's no more than three nights of work.
And then the master will fill both of my pockets with gold.
There's nothing to fear.
She won't rise up out of her coffin.
Even corpses fear the word of God.
Am I right? Absolutely.
You better stay there.
Don't you know that a Cossack doesn't fear anything?
There's no way for anyone to come in.
And from corpses,
I have prayers to protect me.
As soon as I speak the holy words, no demon can possibly harm me.
They'll never touch me!
What am I scared of?
I just had too much to drink.
Ah, candles... That's good.
Lots of candles... to chase away... the gloom from the church... and light it up.
It's nothing, only three nights.
The church should be full of light.
Cheerful and bright.
There's nothing to fear.
She won't touch me now, will she!
Ow! Oh, Satan!
May God forgive me, poor sinner.
Lots of light, now.
Well, let's begin.
Blessed are... O Lord...
Blessed are they that fear the Almighty.
And they that live according to Thy Word.
I wish it were not prohibited to smoke in the House of God.
They that honor Thy commandments, walk in the path of righteousness.
They that praise Thee in the hope of eternal...
What's wrong with some snuff?
A good sniff, to clear the brain.
Merciful Father! Thou art my strength...
She's a witch! A witch come to haunt me!
Sacred circle, save me!
Sacred circle, protect me!
Oh, my God.
Sacred circle, save me!
Sacred circle, protect me!
Away, Satan! Away!
Blessed are they that fear the Almighty...
Away! Away with you!
God in Heaven, I call on Thee for help...
Stay away!
- There's the philosopher!
- He's finished.
It's a lovely place to live!
You could fish all day in that river.
Old man!
I'm not going inside.
I'll sleep right here.
It's not allowed, philosopher.
I have my orders.
- Have you got some borsch for us?
- We have, you old devil.
- How does it taste?
- Ask the philosopher.
- Well?
- What did go on?
Nothing much. Just some noises.
A Cossack doesn't fear anything in this world.
Let's go, Yavtukh.
A Cossack is never afraid of anything.
It's true, the first time, you really are afraid.
But after a while, you're not so afraid.
And after that, you're not afraid at all!
Because there's nothing that can do me any harm.
Lord God! Let not Thy divine Angel be turned against me.
I ask Thee to spare me
Thy terrible wrath.
Have mercy upon Thy servant.
I know my spirit's weak.
God, save me from my weaknesses, preserve my heart from sin, my soul from evil...
Strengthen my spirit and protect me from the temptations of evil.
Have mercy on...
God Almighty, save me!
Heavenly Father, save me!
O Lord!
Save me from the demon!
O Lord!
Save me from the demon!
God, give me strength!
Holy Father in Heaven!
Save me from the evil one!
Khoma!
Khoma!
By the shades of night, may he go blind, turn his hair white.
Bewitch him.
Cover him with snow.
Hey, philosopher! On your feet!
I want music!
I want to have music right now!
From the looks of it, he'll dance all day, that fellow.
Yes, he can dance for a long time.
- Hey, philosopher, what's wrong?
- Don't you see? I'm dancing.
Oh, your hair has turned white!
As white as milk.
Just like good old Yavtukh.
I must talk to your master.
I'll explain everything.
I don't want to pray there again!
What? It's all going well?
Were you able to stay awake?
Yes, I was able to stay awake.
The devil lives in this house. I want to skip out while I'm in one piece.
- What do you mean?
- It's your daughter, sir...
She may have noble blood in her veins, no doubt about that, however, may God have mercy on her soul...
- What about my daughter?
- She's in league with the devil.
She won't let me read the Scriptures in front of her.
You will read, since she summoned you.
She did not wish to bear a spiritual burden to the grave.
The only way to assure her salvation was to have the prayers said.
Release me, I beg you!
Don't make me go through with it.
You will read!
There's just one more night.
You'll do godly work, and I will reward you.
For all the gold in the world...
I wouldn't read another prayer.
That's enough!
Philosopher...
You're wrong if you think you can trifle with me.
That sort of thing is fit for the seminary, but I'll not tolerate it.
I'll order the guards to lash you.
There's nothing so excruciating as as the leather lash on raw flesh.
I know that.
More than half a dozen are unbearable.
However, what you don't know is how expert my men are at it.
They lash you, then we give them some vodka and they begin again.
You may go.
Go back to your duties.
If you fail to do them, you'll have a thousand lashes.
And if you do them, one thousand gold pieces.
A thousand gold pieces!
The old miser was surely lying.
Never mind, good master,
I'll run away from here so fast that even your dogs will never catch up with me.
You should know better than make such a detour.
You nearly ruined your fine robe.
That would've been a shame.
How much did you pay for one yard?
Why don't you keep your mouth shut, dear old Yavtukh?
Foolish dog.
Not hungry? Then let's go to the church.
Are you scared? That witch will give you the time of your life.
Scared of a witch?
Nothing scares a Cossack!
I stood it for two nights.
With God's help, I'll make it three.
She's haunting me because she's got the Devil inside her.
I'd hate to think what sin she's guilty of.
Brother philosopher, it's time to go.
Let's go to the church, dear.
- Think of the torment she's in.
- He was fated to go through it.
I'll read for the third night, and I'll get a thousand gold pieces.
I'll have a ball then, won't I,
Yavtukh?
Go say your prayers, philosopher.
I won't be afraid. I swear,
I won't be afraid.
Lord God! From the depths of hell,
I cry out to Thee.
I pray Thee, have pity on me.
Take heed of my cries.
Drive out the terror that dwells in my heart.
Let me not yield to the temptations of the evil one.
Lord God, help me...
Thou art my Fortress...
My Redeemer, and my Savior...
God Almighty!
Smite her with lightning!
Send down Thy wrath!
Strike her down with Thy fury!
A curse upon you!
With the wings of a bat!
With the blood of a serpent!
I shall curse you!
Curse you!
I summon the vampires!
I summon the werewolves!
I summon the vampires!
I summon the werewolves!
I summon Viy!
Bring Viy here!
Get him! Get him!
Raise my eyelids.
I cannot see!
Don't look him in the eye, or you're lost.
A cock.
I see him!
Get away from me, you fiends!
Help!
- The Fates were unkind to Khoma.
- It was the will of God.
Let's drink to him, may his soul rest in peace.
Khoma was a fine young man.
The kind of man I admire.
- But his life was wasted for nothing.
- I know where he went wrong.
If he hadn't been afraid, the witch couldn't have harmed him.
He should've spit on her tail, and make the sign of the cross.
If anyone should know, I do.
In Kiev, the women who run stalls in the market are all witches.
He wouldn't be dead if he hadn't been afraid.
- No one can prove he's dead.
- That's what everyone says.
Maybe they imagined it.
That stuff about how he died, because of the witch.
After I've had a flask of vodka, even I begin to see witches.
Suppose he wasn't dead?
Suppose that the one walking this way now... was him!
Now that's a good one!
- Are you working?
- We're working.
Keep on working then.
The End
Ladies and gentlemen!
And now the only act of its kind performing without a net.
The most death defying tight wire act,
Gaspar the Great!
Hand me tonight's receipts, Dorando.
Your hands are trembling.
Monica, how can you sit there so calmly and check box office receipts after that horrible catastrophe?
How can you be so cold-blooded?
Realistic is the word.
It's a good thing I took control when it happened.
If I depended on you, we would have had a panic on our hands.
Yes, it's a good thing you're inhuman.
We're running a circus, not a charm school.
And most important, people have to be entertained.
- Yes, yes. "The show must go on."
- Always.
No matter what the cost?
Mmm. Like in a war.
Troops are expendable.
Privates and generals alike.
Expendable.
Are you aiming that at me?
You think you can do without me?
Not yet.
What if I insist?
I'm fed up.
All you have to do is buy me out.
I'm not ready for you to leave.
You know very well I can't afford to buy you out.
You'll just have to wait.
I want out now.
I'm leaving.
Oh, you miserable, gutless adding machine!
What are you trying to do?
Ruin my circus?
- And you have the nerve to want to...
- (KNOCKING)
Come in!
- Miss Rivers?
- Yes.
I'm Detective Sergeant Hutchins.
This is Detective Constable Bradford.
How can I help you, gentlemen?
Well, first I must tell you that none of Gaspar's equipment must be moved or touched until it's been checked by our experts.
Of course.
Now just a few questions.
Who built the apparatus that was used in the high-wire act?
Gaspar himself had the units hand-constructed.
- Did anyone else handle it?
- Yes, our labour crew.
He always checked it personally, though.
If you like, I can give you the names of the helpers.
Well, we shall need more than that.
Please have all your performers and workers assembled at ten o'clock tomorrow morning for routine questioning.
Yes, yes, of course.
You understand this investigation might take a few days?
And until then, nobody is to leave the circus.
Nobody.
Good night.
- Good night.
- (CAR DRIVING AWAY)
Well, Dorando, you heard the law.
Nobody leaves.
That'll keep you from deserting me while I still need you.
You always win, don't you, Monica?
If you had a brain in your head, you'd see that you win, too.
What do you mean?
Well, so far we've had a bad season.
And now with the accident, the splash publicity, it's going to be great for the box office.
People have a morbid curiosity about death.
Especially a violent one.
That's why I'm sure that we'll be jam-packed tomorrow night, with people hoping they'll see a repeat performance of death.
It really excites you.
I haven't seen you in such high spirits since we started the tour.
Poor Dorando.
Why are you always so depressed?
What can I do to cheer you up?
You know what?
I just may let you tuck me in tonight.
But first, there are a few things you have to attend to.
I want you to get photographs of Gaspar and send them to all the newspapers.
It'll dress up the story.
Then I want you to wire all the agents in London, Paris and Berlin.
Get a top act to replace him.
But that will take me most of the night.
So what's the difference?
I'm a light sleeper.
I've got a great equestrian act for you, Miss Rivers: The Gorraras.
The last time they performed, two of their horses dropped dead in the ring of old age.
What about the Fabulous Glen?
He's still the best trick cyclist in the business.
When he's sober, which isn't often.
Look, don't waste my time with these broken down has-beens.
Some of them are as old as my elephants and twice as wrinkled.
I want something fresh.
A new face with an exciting act.
I'd like to talk to you, Miss Rivers.
- What about?
- My act.
- Frank Hawkins is the name.
- I never heard of you.
Well, I'm new in this part of the world.
But I overheard you tell them that you wanted something fresh and exciting.
- And you, of course, fill the bill?
- I certainly do.
Don't you have an agent?
I do better handling myself.
You see, Bruno, we have a double daredevil.
Agent and artist all rolled into one.
After you've seen my act, you'll agree with me.
I must say you certainly are the shy type. What do you do?
- High wire act.
- That's a bit of luck.
You know, of course, what happened to our last one, Gaspar the Great.
I caught his act last night.
Saw him hanging around.
Leave the comedy to Bruno and the rest of the clowns.
I haven't time for your grisly jokes.
Just give me the details of your act.
- High-wire. Sixty feet up over a...
- I know, over a safety net.
No, not quite.
Why don't you see the act for yourself?
One performance.
You can make up your mind.
And if I like it? How much?
I'll leave the money up to you.
See my act tonight, and if
I'm not worth top money, well, this place is loaded with exits.
On those terms, you got a deal.
Mr Hawkins!
You're a bit jumpy, aren't you, Mr Hawkins?
I don't like being touched.
Especially by a stranger.
Well, we won't be strangers for long.
My name is Harrison Liston.
I specialise in the representation of circus acts and novelties.
I don't care what you do.
We haven't met, but I know you, Mr Hawkins.
- What the hell do you want?
- I want to help you.
I listened to you selling yourself just now.
Wonderful, quite wonderful.
Up to a point.
And then you kill your case by leaving the money up to Monica Rivers.
I handle my own affairs. Now, why don't you mind your own business?
You need me in other ways.
After all, you're a foreigner in this country.
I can, er... smooth over some bothersome details for you.
Look, I don't want anything from you, so why don't you leave me alone?
As I said, I can smooth over some bothersome details
Like, er... getting you a labour permit.
After all, you wouldn't want the authorities to know about what happened in Canada, would you, Mr Hawkins?
It might make getting that labour permit a bit difficult.
All right. All right!
Don't ever come near me again.
And now, it is my special privilege to give you that daredevil of the high wire,
The Magnificent Hawkins!
Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to see the only act of its kind in the entire world.
The Magnificent Hawkins performs without a net sixty feet above the steel bayonets and wearing a blindfold.
He defies death with every step.
I now call your attention to the arena directly under the wire.
Ladies and gentlemen, in his walk of death,
The Magnificent Hawkins!
Here's your contract.
Thank you, Mr Dorando.
You'll find everything in that agreement to your satisfaction.
You should, with that salary.
It's the biggest bite any performer has ever taken out of this circus.
You're older than I am, Mr Dorando, but I'm sure you'll agree in this world you only get what you deserve.
No more, no less.
You can keep your little gems of wisdom to yourself.
What about my private caravan?
- Miss Rivers promised me that I...
- I don't care what Miss Rivers promised.
On business deals, my decision is final.
Besides, we don't happen to have an extra caravan.
Unless of course you'd like me to give up mine.
No, thanks.
It's not nearly comfortable enough.
Thank you for letting me keep it.
Next season, if you're still with us, and continue to draw, we'll think about your private caravan.
Maybe I won't have to wait that long.
That's, er, Hawkins.
I-N-S. Frank Hawkins.
Looks pretty good, doesn't it?
Don't get carried away, son.
I've painted many names on these caravans, and I've painted many out.
And I've yet to come across a name that could outlive the paint.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, we give you the world's greatest elephant act.
MONICA: And now, Jody, the wonder elephant, weighing over five tons, will walk over six girls lying on the floor of the arena.
Sure beats eating in the canteen.
We ought to do it more often.
I'm crazy about you, Monica.
- I'm fond of you, Frank.
- No more?
Why should there be more?
You're still a stranger to me.
Actually, I know very little about you.
You... well, you don't talk about your past.
That's because I'm only interested in the future.
Our future.
Ha-ha. Not so fast, Frank.
I like you, but I don't want this to mushroom.
Why not?
What are you scared of?
Long ago...
One day I'll give you all the chapters.
Long ago, I lost the capacity to love.
Let's enjoy what we have.
It makes this crazy circus life more bearable.
You sure know how to put out a fire.
If you want me to spell it out for you, I will.
To me, what we have is no more important than a greeting card.
Sometimes maybe not as friendly.
I'll make you change your mind.
- You'll try, and you'll fail.
- Why?
- Too many obstacles.
- Like Dorando?
He's just my business partner.
Well, I hate the old lecher!
The way he drools over you.
The way he watches me all the time.
- He stinks of jealousy.
- Stop it!
That's just what I mean.
You get all worked up and spoil everything.
Now look, Frank.
What I do with my life is strictly my own affair.
I'll remember that.
And now...
I need my sleep.
Good night, Monica.
- (CLANGING THUD)
- (SCREAMING)
BRUNO:
Miss Rivers! Miss Rivers!
Just a minute.
Miss Rivers, please come quick.
Something terrible has happened.
It's Mr Dorando.
Listen everybody, I know how terribly shocked we all are.
There's no point in you staying up any longer.
Please go back to sleep.
Please.
"Go to sleep"!
That's her remedy for everything, as if we were children.
If you listen to me, we do not go to sleep.
Not yet.
It is clear to me there is a killer loose, and none of us is safe until the murderer is caught.
I'm really frightened.
After what I just saw, I'm so scared
I can hear me bones rattle.
Even I admit it.
For the first time in my life, my nerves bother me.
I am stronger than two horses, you all know that when I bend an iron bar with my teeth, it is for real.
Iron!
But even I cannot fight what I cannot see.
Exactly.
That is why we must find out who is behind these killings.
These killings?
You don't think Gaspar was an accident, do you?
Only a fool would swallow that.
Who are you?
The Chief of Police?
Well, how do you know what's what?
That's right! I say we do what Miss Rivers told us.
Go to bed.
Leave police work to the police.
And entertaining to us.
You! You wouldn't stick your neck out to save your mother.
Oh, why don't you shut up?
Look at her. She can't wait to get back to the caravan and her bottle of booze.
Who do you think you are?
Why don't you two go and fight in your own caravan?
Well, I'm not afraid to come right out and say it.
We all know that Miss Rivers has lost no sleep over these murders.
With my own ears I heard her say that murder is good for business.
Doesn't that tell you who's behind them?
I ask you, when did we ever play to such capacity crowds?
The circus has never done such good business.
I tell you, she's behind the whole thing.
Matilda, you're crazy!
You're a hothead. A lunatic!
BRUNO:
That's what I say.
We all know it can't be Miss Rivers.
You speak for yourself.
We all know you're her slave.
Give the others a chance to talk.
You! You advertise yourself as a clairvoyant. You tell fortunes.
Who do you say is responsible?
About murder?
Leave me out. I know nothing.
All you're interested in is having your palm crossed.
- Why don't you speak up?
- Yes, this is most urgent.
So, tell us. What do the stars and your tea leaves and your crystal ball tell you?
They tell me to mind my own business.
You're not only a fake but a coward!
You see! We have to take things into our own hands and stop these killings before we're all murdered one by one.
And I say once again, it's the boss!
You hear the lions?
They smell blood.
They're very sensitive.
Last night, they were restless.
Ahh! Before you get carried away, let me ask some questions.
- You, Emil.
- What about me?
I refresh your memory.
Last year in West Berlin, you told me that Dorando promised you a raise.
So what?
But he never gave it to you.
So you held a grudge against him.
I wouldn't kill over money!
- No?
- I wouldn't!
You always walk alone at night.
Yeah, that's right.
I myself have seen you.
Then it could be you.
What are you doing walking alone in the middle of the night?
Me, I walk for fresh air.
Fresh air? Who believes that?
You told me you hated Dorando.
And you once told me you hated Gaspar because he made fun of your whiskers.
Maybe you did it.
You fool! How could I ever get away with murder?
I'm the easiest one in the whole circus to identify.
You see my beard before you see me.
But you! I heard you tell Gaspar to keep away from your wife.
That's true.
I warned him to stay away.
Look, I may be all bones, but I can still use a gun.
Anyway, she still left me.
She couldn't take the bruises.
Hold it! Hold it, everyone!
We'll never get anywhere fighting among ourselves.
Take my word for it.
It's the boss!
MONICA: You're right.
You'll never get anywhere, period.
You slut! You miserable ingrate!
When I picked you and your lover
Lazlo up, you were starving.
I advanced you money for your act, gave you billing.
And how do you repay me?
By stirring up trouble behind my back!
- You can't frighten us. I still say...
- Cut your tongue out first.
I can still get a dozen acts like yours.
And you! If it weren't for me, you'd all starve to death.
- We're frightened.
- We're nervous.
I know what you are.
Look, let me do the worrying.
Now get back to your caravans.
We're sold out for tomorrow's matinee, and I want a great show.
Lazlo!
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
Let's say that you just got carried away.
But that loud-mouthed Matilda, you'd better control her, shut her up, or I'll cancel your act and toss you both out of here.
Ah! You sent for me, Commissioner?
Brooks, I hate to mar the picture, but you'll have to remove that boutonnière.
- You know how allergic I am to pollen.
- Oh, I'm very sorry, sir.
Tell me, Superintendent, when you were a little boy, did you ever want to run away and join a circus?
No, sir. Not at all.
No, I had a very happy life, with love on both sides, plus a liberal allowance and two doting aunts.
Well, spare me the details, because you've just joined a circus.
I have?
May I ask in what capacity?
Well, certainly not as a performer.
I want you to go to Liverpool.
- The Rivers Circus?
- Exactly.
And I'm glad to see you read something besides the society page.
Well, I guess I'm like most people, sir.
Reading about murder gives me a thrill.
Yes, well your job is to stop it.
It's a little bit late for that, isn't it?
At least for Mr Dorando, with a spike through his head.
I saw some pretty gruesome pictures downstairs.
Sir, I understood, that, er... you were bringing your suspects here.
What suspects? The murderer didn't leave a single clue.
Anyway, Brooks, you hunt a wild animal in its native habitat.
You don't bring a tiger up from the jungles of Asia
- to shoot it in Hyde Park.
- I quite agree, sir.
Did the local police come up with anything?
Nothing. From the report, the killer must have worn skin-tight gloves, and the ground around had been trampled on by too many people to get any footprints.
This circus is rather accident-prone, isn't it?
I recall there was another gruesome death.
Mmm.
That's item two on the agenda.
Three weeks ago in Leeds, their star performer, a high wire virtuoso called Gaspar the Great, was hung to death by his own wire when it broke beneath his feet.
Was that an accident?
Well, the death of the second man makes it look like murder, doesn't it?
I'll be ready to leave in an hour, sir.
Before you go, Superintendent, just a piece of fatherly advice.
- Always ready to receive that, sir.
- That suit you have on, it looks new and expensive.
- Savile Row?
- Of course.
And hand-made shoes.
Dressing smartly is a fetish of yours.
- Well, sir, I don't drink, or gamble.
- I know, your only passion, apart from your work, is your wardrobe.
- Yes, sir. Your advice?
- Just this:
Leave your expensive feathers in their moth-proof containers.
You'll find this circus a rather untidy place.
Brooks, concentrate on the job.
I know you're the man for it.
That's why I'm letting you handle it alone.
There's one more city on their itinerary before they arrive here in London.
Stay with them.
MATILDA:
Very nice!
You've got knuckles on your hands.
Use 'em next time you enter my caravan.
Sorry, but as you can see, my hands are full.
Why don't you make yourself at home?
Thanks. I thought you might like a little company, so I brought round a bottle.
I don't drink.
In that case, you can watch me.
- Do you make a habit of this?
- Drinking?
Coming to men's caravans at twelve o'clock at night.
Only if I like them.
I'm flattered, but you could have waited for an invitation.
Well, I realise you're the elusive type, Frank.
Women have to chase you, so here I am.
And now that you've caught me?
Isn't this a little dangerous?
Doesn't it worry you that Lazlo might find out?
At this moment,
Lazlo is snoring away in bed.
That's all he ever does do in bed.
As much as I would like to, honey,
I'm afraid I have to show you the door, and bid you good night.
What's the matter, Frank?
Don't you like me?
I find you very attractive.
It's just that you're peddling your merchandise at the wrong booth.
You wouldn't say that to Monica Rivers.
What the hell does she have to do with you?
No need to be so rough, Frank.
I was just trying to be friendly.
Well, I hope your timing in your act is better than it is here.
My timing is very good.
You knock me out, Matilda.
You really do.
I get it. You're not worried about
Lazlo finding out, are you?
What do you mean?
It's Monica you're afraid of.
You've got to be kidding.
Why should Monica worry me?
I know all about you and her.
- Who cares?
- I do, for your sake.
Well, that's nice of you.
She's dangerous, Frank.
Very dangerous.
You may think you'll last forever, but you're wrong.
- Just remember Dorando.
- What are you getting at?
He thought he was the only one in her life, too, and when she had no more use for him, she got rid of him.
You'd better watch your mouth, Matilda.
It could get you into trouble.
I don't care. I'm not afraid of Monica, and she knows it.
I say she killed Dorando, and one day I'm going to prove it.
- You're crazy!
- Am I? Just you remember what I said.
And the next time she puts her arms around you, make sure those loving hands aren't carrying a knife.
You loud-mouthed broad.
Get out of here!
Ohhh!
Matilda, darling, you must be more careful of leaving like that.
You'll damage your brain.
You cow!
I'll teach you to laugh at me.
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, you...
GUSTAVO:
Wanda!
Wanda!
You cow!
And you!
You'll get yours, too!
Trouble-maker!
All you do is make trouble.
Wait till I get you to the caravan.
RADIO: And now we play the new record from the Kenny Glen Group.
Quite a party.
Did you enjoy it?
What are you talking about, Monica?
Don't get any wrong ideas.
Wrong ideas?
Just because you've been entertaining a woman in your caravan in the middle of the night, dressed like that?
Now use your head. You don't think
I invited her in here, do you?
- Yes!
- Well, you're wrong.
Matilda came in here unasked and uninvited, and I threw her out.
After two hours!
Right away. That's what the ruckus was all about.
- Why?
- Why what?
Well, you're certainly no saint, and, er... she's attractive, in a common sort of way.
Why did you throw her out?
She started shooting her mouth off.
About me?
She's crazy.
She thinks you murdered Dorando.
And you?
What do you think?
You can trust me, Monica.
- BRUNO: It's supposed to be lucky.
- I hope you're right.
All the same, I shall watch where I walk in future.
This your first time at a circus?
Backstage, so to speak, yes it is.
Thought so.
You don't look like a circus man.
And a circus man would never have trodden in elephant's...
Yes, quite, quite.
I'll try not to do it again.
Are you looking for something?
Yes, I am, as a matter of fact.
Perhaps you can help me.
- I want Miss Monica Rivers.
- What for?
- I beg your pardon?
- You're not another reporter, are you?
No, no, I'm not a reporter.
We've been told to chase them off the lot if we see any.
- I'll take you to Miss Rivers.
- Thank you.
Surprised, eh?
Can't tell the difference when I'm behind that door.
Do it all the time.
Come on.
What's your name?
Well, I have to introduce you, don't I?
Can't just shove you through the door.
No, of course you can't.
I'm Detective Superintendent Brooks.
- You're a detective?
- Uh-huh.
But we've had detectives here.
I thought they'd finished.
I'm from Scotland Yard.
- (KNOCKING)
- MONICA: Come in.
Miss Rivers, there's a man to see you.
Detective Superintendent Brooks.
Well, show him in, Bruno.
He's from Scotland Yard!
- Good morning, Miss Rivers.
- Good morning.
- Bruno?
- Yes?
- Who's that?
- You'd like to know, wouldn't you?
- That's why I asked you.
- Well, I'm not going to tell you.
It's confidential.
Don't give me that.
You don't know who he is.
You're just a messenger boy.
Me, a messenger boy?
I don't know, don't I!
Well, I do, see?
He's a detective from Scotland Yard, see!
A Detective Superintendent.
Sorry, Bruno, you did know, didn't you?
But is all this questioning necessary?
I've told the local police everything I know.
And they've called in Scotland Yard,
Miss Rivers.
You'll agree there is still some areas that can stand clearing up.
Like who the murderer is, for instance.
Yes, yes, of course.
Well, anything I can tell you.
How long was Albert Dorando an associate of yours?
- Seven years.
- In what capacity?
- Business manager.
- Just business manager?
What do you mean?
Well, it sometimes happens that when two people work together for seven years, something more than a business friendship develops.
Well, naturally, as you say, we did become good friends.
Intimate friends?
If what you are trying to find out is whether or not I slept with Dorando, the answer is no.
BROOKS: I'm sorry I had to press the point, Miss Rivers.
You'll understand that we cannot rule out a sex motive for the murder.
Did Mr Dorando have any financial interest in the circus?
None whatsoever.
I own the circus, lock, stock and barrel.
It's belonged to my family for fifty years.
BROOKS:
Has it always been successful?
No, no.
No, no, there's nothing certain in show business.
We've eaten caviar, and we've eaten sawdust.
But I understand that since the death of Gaspar, business has been brisk.
That's right.
So it would be correct to say,
Miss Rivers, that the circus, and therefore yourself, have gained financially from Gaspar's death.
What are you insinuating?
I'm not insinuating anything.
I'm simply trying to establish a few facts.
Now, is it true or not?
Now, can you think of anybody...
Why don't you come inside?
I'm sure you'll find it warmer, and much more comfortable.
Superintendent Brooks, may I introduce Frank Hawkins?
Ah, yes, of course! You took over the Great Gaspar's spot, didn't you, Mr Hawkins?
How opportune, as what I was about to ask Miss Rivers was:
"could you think of anyone
"who benefited from either of the two deaths?"
You don't pull any punches, do you, Superintendent?
Well, for your information,
I wasn't even with the circus when Gaspar was killed.
- Where were you, then?
- On a train.
- BROOKS: On a train.
- FRANK: Travelling up to Leeds to see Miss Rivers, to ask about a job.
That's rather strange, isn't it?
You came to see about a job in a circus that already had a high wire act.
Could anybody prove you were on that train?
Then there's no proof that you didn't travel up the day before?
Why should I lie?
Whoever interfered with
Gaspar's apparatus, Mr Hawkins, knew all about the rig.
Knew just what to do, and how to do it, and he could climb up to the heights of the tent to carry out his work.
Well, it wasn't me.
Anyone could have climbed up there.
That's right.
Every man, woman and child in this circus has been trained to climb ropes and ladders.
When the Big Top is raised, everybody helps.
I see.
Now if you've finished with your questions and decided not to arrest me yet, I'll go.
I have a matinee to get ready for.
There is one more question,
Mr Hawkins.
On the night that Dorando was killed, where were you?
In my caravan. Asleep.
I suppose there are no witnesses to that, either?
I was alone.
Where were you, Miss Rivers?
I... I was here.
I knew nothing about it until Bruno pounded on the door and woke me up.
All right, Mr Hawkins, that's all for now.
Don't plan any long trips away from the circus, for the time being.
Will you want me any more?
I, too, have a matinee.
That's all, thank you, Miss Rivers.
For the moment.
Will you be here long?
Until I find the murderer, and that brings me to my final request.
Have you anywhere I could stay?
Here on the circus grounds?
Oh, no, there's very little available space.
There is one place.
Dorando's caravan.
Do you have the keys?
Thank you, Miss Rivers.
MONICA:
And now, ladies and gentlemen, presenting Phyllis Allen, and her intelligent poodles.
- (DOGS BARKING)
- (CHILDREN LAUGHING)
- You're late.
- I'm sorry. Can I see you later?
- Too busy.
- I have to see you.
Look, I have a million things to do.
Payroll has to be made up, bills to be paid. Sorry, no time.
Then you've got to make time.
I've got to see you.
Smile. You're on!
Bruno, will you come in now, please?
- MATILDA: What did you tell him?
- My lips are sealed.
"My lips are sealed"!
You stupid bag of bones!
Well, I'll tell you one thing: mine aren't.
Tell me, Bruno, after you heard the screams and the commotion, what did you do?
I ran as fast as I could and woke up Miss Rivers.
She was asleep, then?
Oh, yes. I mean, I think so,
'cause I knocked five or six times.
Where were you when you heard the screams?
On the way back to my caravan from the canteen.
I always have a late snack.
Did you see or hear anything of a suspicious nature
- before you heard the screams?
- No, sir.
Bruno, you must circulate a good deal round here.
Can you think of any reason why anyone would want to murder Dorando?
No. No.
He really was a very nice manager.
I could always get a little advance from him when I was short.
- I mean, when I was short of money.
- Yes, of course.
Now you called Dorando the manager.
Wasn't he also one of the owners?
No, don't think so.
Well, thank you very much, Bruno.
That's all for now.
Now, don't forget, if you see or hear anything that might help solve this crime,
- you'll let me know, huh?
- Oh, yes, Superintendent.
Will you come in now please, er... madam?
And what did you tell him?
Or are your lips sealed, too?
When you deal with the law, you should be careful and dignified, both of which you will find beyond your capabilities.
I told you I was busy.
I don't have time for eavesdroppers.
I'll say one thing for you, Monica, you sure put on a clever performance for that detective.
I put on a performance?
What about you?
You told him you were on a train the night of Gaspar's death.
That's right. I was.
Well, then, why did you tell me the first time we met that you saw Gaspar killed?
I was only kidding.
Don't you remember, you told me not to make any grisly jokes?
But what about you?
Didn't you tell me that
Dorando was your partner?
Yet I overheard you tell the Superintendent you owned the circus, lock, stock and barrel.
What the hell has that got to do with you?
With you, a man never knows where he stands.
First you give, and then you hold back.
I know you like to let men dangle.
Well, that might have worked with
Dorando, but it doesn't with me!
You've got Dorando on the brain.
He was my manager, and nothing more.
- Oh, I know he was...
- You know nothing!
Monica, you're playing a dangerous game.
Every lie is a trap.
When Dorando was killed,
I heard you say you were asleep.
Well, I was in bed.
Who should know that better than you?
Well, after you eased me out, that must have been your shadow
I saw run into Dorando's caravan.
You're crazy!
Don't deny it. I saw you.
Frank, what do you really want?
I want a share in your circus.
Let's say whatever Dorando owned,
I want.
Well, at last it's out in the open.
I want us to be partners, Monica.
Real partners.
- So you want a share in my circus, huh?
- That's right.
All right, Frank, you've got it.
- (KNOCKING)
- Come in!
- Angela!
- Hello.
Miss Burrows?
Regrettably, Miss Rivers, I've had to bring back your daughter and deliver her right to your door.
Oh, please don't be angry.
I can explain.
Excuse me, darling.
Mr Hawkins, as you can see, an unexpected visit from my daughter and the head of her school.
Of course. We can settle our business any time.
And now, Miss Burrows, what exactly happened?
- Please Mother, listen to me first.
- Be quiet.
You've always had a knack for causing trouble.
Yes, Miss Rivers. You've just summed it up: trouble.
Angela resists all discipline and supervision, and this is something we simply cannot tolerate.
As you know, the
Fenmore School for Young Ladies stands for character building, education and good breeding.
Our reputation goes back seventy-five years.
I'm well aware of your school and its reputation, Miss Burrows.
That's why I enrolled Angela.
Now, what exactly did she do?
Broke all the rules.
Refused to study.
No obedience whatsoever.
I myself have caught her smoking cigarettes, imitating her teachers in a most unflattering manner.
Besides smoking cigarettes and a few harmless pranks, what else did she do?
She upset the morale of other students.
- Quite, quite distressing.
- What do you mean?
On one occasion, she stuffed pillows into her bed, rumpled up the blankets so that it looked as if she were asleep.
And where was she?
Later, she was found in a closet, giggling away.
It was only a joke.
You had the whole school in an uproar looking for you.
If you had these problems with Angela, why didn't you contact me sooner?
Miss Rivers, you're rather difficult to pin down.
Your circus is constantly on the move.
What is the position now?
Your daughter has been expelled by the disciplinary board of the school.
I'm sorry, Miss Rivers.
We tried, but we failed.
Angela is now your responsibility.
I hope you have better luck.
Good afternoon.
Good day.
Angela.
Angela, what am I to do with you?
Just let me stay here.
I simply couldn't stand being away from you and the circus.
I wanted you to have a fine education, meet people outside the world of the circus, make other friendships.
It didn't work.
I just don't belong with that group.
Coming from the circus,
I'm different from other girls.
They made me feel like an outcast.
Nobody really wanted to be my friend.
You're just as good as they are.
I was different.
And on holidays when the other girls' parents came to visit them,
- where were you?
- I'm sorry, Angela.
- I did try to get away, but I...
- I know. You were too busy.
I was lonely and miserable.
I just wanted to die.
I had no-one.
I know.
Please don't make me go away again.
Let me stay here with you.
With the circus. It's where I belong.
After all, it's in my blood like it's in yours.
Oh, darling, you certainly picked a bad time.
You read, of course, about all the terrible things that have been happening here.
I know. It's awful.
I had nightmares thinking something might happen to you.
Can I stay?
All right, we'll try it for a while.
I'll find somewhere for you to sleep and then, tomorrow, we'll look for something for you to do.
And I mean work.
Hard work.
Thank you.
You'll see, I'll work hard.
- And a tomato, please.
- Certainly.
It's Angela!
Bruno! Mmm. Hello.
Romy! Mmm.
How nice to see you.
How well your beard looks.
It's a new shampoo I use.
Very successful.
- When did you get back, Angela?
- Today.
- And how long are you staying?
- Oh, for ever, I hope.
- But what about your schooling?
- I've left school.
- Angela, darling.
- Oh, hello Matilda.
Did I hear you say you'd left school?
Yes. Mother's giving me a job in the circus.
What a shame you had to return at a time like this, when we have a homicidal killer amongst us.
Matilda, darling, it's time we went.
Good night, Angela.
Try not to worry too much.
After all, you have no cause to be afraid.
What did she mean by that?
Don't pay any attention to what Matilda has to say.
I don't, but she's always been a troublemaker.
I don't understand why you keep her here.
They have a good act, but I may have to get rid of them if
Matilda keeps on causing trouble.
Coffee for me.
I'm sure you'll be all right in the girls' quarters.
Oh, of course I will.
Good night.
Angela?
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Good night.
Good night, darling.
Bruno!
I hope I didn't frighten you,
Miss Rivers.
Why you fool, you scared me half to death.
- I didn't mean to.
- You didn't mean to.
I was on the way back to my caravan after seeing Miss Romy home,
- and I saw you come out of the canteen.
- So you followed me.
Flitting from shadow to shadow like Jack the Ripper.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Don't be ridiculous at this time of night. Go to sleep!
Ladies and gentlemen, I now give you
Ingemar the Fearless.
- (GROWLING)
- (WHIP CRACKING)
Matilda!
I left instructions for you to report to me in my caravan before you went on.
- I was resting.
- Not all of you.
Your poisonous tongue, as usual, was very busy.
And I know that you've been talking out of turn to the Superintendent.
He asked me if I knew anything or saw anything, so I came right out and told him I suspect you.
My mother has enough on her hands running this circus without you causing trouble for her.
Angela, you're a very sweet child, but really, this is none of your business.
Miss Rivers, my job makes it necessary for me to interrogate everyone who might be involved.
Of course, I questioned Matilda, as I did you and many others.
I'm not complaining about that, but I just won't have anybody in my circus filling you with a pack of lies.
You ready, Matilda darling?
Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness one of the most dangerous and mystifying acts ever performed anywhere.
Before your very eyes,
Lazlo the Nonpareil, will saw a woman in half.
Ladies and gentlemen, now that you've had the pleasure of meeting me, let me present my beautiful and brave partner, Matilda.
Maybe she is too dumb to be frightened.
Or maybe she trusts me completely.
Anyway, every time she steps into this box, she whispers in my ear,
"Lazlo, my life is in your hands."
And believe me, it is!
And now I need the assistance of two gentlemen from the audience.
May I have some volunteers?
Thank you, gentlemen.
Er... you, sir and you, sir.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Now may I ask you to tell the audience truthfully,
- have I ever seen either of you before?
- No.
In other words, you are complete strangers to me.
Yes, that's correct.
Would you be kind enough to open up the doors on top, and in front?
Matilda, darling, would you be reckless enough to step inside?
You will observe, ladies and gentlemen, that she occupies the full length inside.
Now, in full view of the audience, would you close the doors of the box.
Thank you. Thank you.
Bring down the saw.
Would you examine the teeth of the saw?
So, you see, sir, after the two men from the audience had opened the box,
Matilda climbed inside.
The box was shut.
The rotating saw was brought on, and applied to the centre of the box.
Now at this point Matilda should have pressed this spring down here.
Oh, what does that do?
It operates this trap in the platform, which allowed her to sink her middle section so that, although her head and her feet were still exposed, her body was out of the way of the saw and free from danger.
Well, what went wrong?
The mechanism failed to work.
Two screws had been removed from the hinges, here.
The trap wouldn't operate, she couldn't sink her body, and, before she could signal to Lazlo, it was all over.
So it couldn't possibly have been an accident.
Definitely not.
Have you questioned Lazlo?
Well, he's in a state of shock and under heavy sedation.
The doctor would only allow me three minutes with him.
But from what he says, and from his record, he's performed this trick for eleven years without mishap.
It was his custom to inspect the box personally before it was brought on.
- Did he do so last night?
- He swears he did.
- Do you suspect anybody?
- There's no lack of suspects, sir.
For a starter, Miss Rivers.
I heard her quarrelling with Matilda last night just before the wretched girl crawled into this coffin.
They hated each other.
Enough to murder?
Your car's here to take you to the airport, sir.
Thank you. I'll be right out.
What about this Rivers woman?
- Her husband was killed six years ago.
- Killed?
Yes, he was a trapeze artist here in the circus.
There was an accident, and...
This circus has a history of violent death.
I checked up with the local police where the accident happened.
They say it was a clear case of accidental death.
However, I don't think
Miss Rivers grieved for too long, because soon afterwards she cast off her widow's weeds and took up with Dorando. Now, she's involved with Frank Hawkins.
Serious?
I don't think so.
She's a cool one.
I'm sure she can seal off her love life if it gets in the way of her career.
Her main drive is to run a successful circus.
There's no doubt these deaths have given it a morbid glamour.
Recent box office returns have been spectacular.
Fill me in on this man you mentioned, Frank Hawkins.
He, too, is definitely worth watching.
I checked on his past.
Found out he'd killed a man in Toronto, Canada two years ago.
- Oh?
- At the inquest the verdict was justifiable homicide. Self defence.
Is there any evidence to connect him with what happened last night?
- No, none at all.
- What about Lazlo?
Now that's a bit of a puzzle.
Although there was no formal marriage, and Matilda was a bit of a flirt, they seemed to be a happy couple.
And yet I found out that Lazlo had been gambling away their joint earnings.
Maybe they quarrelled over that.
I've had no time to check on that yet.
Maybe one way to find out about all of them is to close down the circus.
Er, if I may suggest... at this stage, we'd gain nothing by doing that.
Shut the circus, and all my suspects scatter.
This way, they all remain together, under my eye.
All right, Brooks, I'll go along with you.
Do you need any help?
I'd rather work it alone.
Very well. It's only a matter of two more days before the circus opens in London.
Stay with it.
All right, driver.
See you in London.
Monica, have you decided on my share yet?
After we open in London, I'll have my lawyer draw up a contract.
But the way I feel at the moment, you're only sharing trouble.
Frank, I have an urge to get rid of the circus.
Leave it and get rid of it.
You can't do that.
And, no matter how difficult things are, you've got to get a grip on yourself.
I can't help it.
I've got the jitters.
I'm not made of stone.
Look, all eyes are on you, Monica.
How you act affects everybody.
I always admired the cool, sure way you ran things.
Well, it's getting to be more than I can handle, what with the police hounding me, and the performers scared and griping, and suspicious of each other.
If you crumble, everything you've worked so hard to achieve will fall apart.
You know, for the first time, it isn't enough.
This circus is jinxed.
It's becoming a nightmare.
I keep wondering and thinking "who's next?"
What's going on here?
Mother!
Gustavo's taking me into his act.
I'm sorry my knife frightened you,
Miss Rivers.
Frightened? I'm furious!
Who gave you the right to make decisions around here?
Where's Wanda, your regular partner?
She's been drinking again.
There is no stopping her.
More and more, it is dangerous to work with her.
Without a reliable partner,
I shall have to cancel or...
Not so fast!
Then what should I do?
Angela volunteered.
I considered myself lucky.
- I wanted to surprise you.
- That you did.
I want to work.
You told me to.
Maybe that's not a bad idea.
Well, with Lazlo and Matilda out, you certainly are going to need Gustavo's act.
Oh, please let me do it.
You're not lying about Wanda?
Go see for yourself.
She'll barely make it today.
About the future,
I let you make the decision.
All right.
I'll check details with you later.
And I want to see this act before we open in London.
Thanks.
Just one warning, darling.
The hazards of the act are nothing compared to the dangers built into Gustavo.
He thinks he's a throwback to Casanova and Don Juan.
You flatter me, Miss Rivers.
But believe me, nothing is further from my mind.
Keep it that way.
You look beautiful, Romy.
I always dress up for the big party.
I remember how you looked last year.
You absolutely sparkled.
One thing I like about coming to London is the celebration
Miss Rivers gives us.
All you can eat and all you can drink.
Yeah, we can forget all our troubles and concentrate on having a good time.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go.
Monica. Excuse me.
To you. Here's hoping you banished the jinx.
I'll drink to that!
You were certainly right not to cancel the party.
Everybody's enjoying themselves.
When people are troubled, give them a celebration.
You know, the French Revolution could have been avoided if Louis XVI had done that.
Don't forget what happened to Marie Antoinette.
But I have you to protect me.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, a big surprise.

- Would you dance with me?
- I'd love to.
Monica, I don't want to pressure you, darling, but... did you talk to your lawyer?
It's all arranged.
You'll have 25% of the circus, and 100% of me.
...and for the last part of our vacation, we'll visit
Copenhagen, Berlin and Madrid.
I'll help you choose the acts for our next season.
It sounds wonderful.
They make a handsome couple.
I think she's too old for him.
Well, he doesn't think so, and that's what matters.
Your mother will never grow old.
She has the gift of eternal youth.
I'm famished.
- Would you get us some food?
- Sure.
Angela, you're not dancing.
Aren't you enjoying yourself?
You seem to be doing it for the whole family.
Ha. Anything wrong with that?
I heard what your plans are with lover boy Frank.
I was hoping that we could go away together when the season ends.
Just the two of us.
Angela, may I remind you that you made the decision to stay here.
Yes, I wanted to stay, because
I still hoped I had a mother.
But it's funny, all my memories of "mother" are of teachers and other people who brought me up.
I was shunted around from place to place like a piece of baggage with the wrong address pasted on it.
But you certainly never lacked anything.
No, except what I needed most.
You.
- (BAND FINISHES NUMBER)
- (APPLAUSE)
May I join you?
Please.
Superintendent...
I hope that you're aware that we're all still jittery and under tremendous tension.
I have an eerie feeling that the killer will strike again any moment.
That's quite understandable, particularly in a place like a circus where everyone has freedom of movement.
Two elements govern a killer: motive and opportunity.
Here, there are all kinds of opportunities.
What about motives?
You have to have a reason for killing.
Of course. Some are obvious, aren't they?
Like immediate gain or revenge.
Some are strange, subtle, difficult to define.
What steps have you taken for tomorrow night's opening?
I'll show you, Miss Rivers.
On special instructions from Commissioner Dalby, your opening night will be covered like this.
We'll have Scotland Yard men stationed all round the grounds at strategic points.
At the animal pens, the caravan lines, the canteens, all the exits and entrances.
And of course, we'll have men mingling with the audience and also backstage.
Believe me, Miss Rivers, every precaution possible, to prevent anyone or anything marring the performance, will be taken.
But your men backstage, they won't...
You ready, Angela?
I can guarantee that.
Good luck to you.
To both of you.
Ladies and gentlemen!
It is my extreme pleasure to introduce the first appearance together of Angela and Gustavo.
Two incomparable artists with nerves of steel.
And now, a spectacular act that has been thrilling audiences everywhere on our tour.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my special privilege to give you that death-defying daredevil, the Magnificent Hawkins!
- (BLOWING WHISTLE)
- (APPLAUSE)
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Magnificent Hawkins will perform one of the most incredible feats ever seen in a circus arena.
He will stand on a chair while balancing on the wires sixty feet above the steel bayonets.
I had to kill him.
I had to kill them all.
I had to destroy your circus.
It murdered my father, and now it's taking you away from me.
Kill! Kill! Kill!
That's all I feel inside me.
Mother, I gave you one last chance, but now you've turned against me.
I've got to kill you!
MONICA:
Angela! Angela!
Get those cables out of the way.

All I want to do is save the children... not destroy them.
More than anything,
I love children.
More than anything.
They need affection... love... someone who will belong to them... and to whom they will belong.
Miss Giddens, may I ask you a somewhat personal question?
Do you have an imagination?
Oh!
Oh, yes,
I can answer that.
- Yes.
- Good.
Truth is very seldom understood by any but imaginative persons... and I want to be quite truthful.
I'm a bachelor... but not, I might add, a lonely one.
I spend a great deal of time abroad.
And as for my London life, well, it amuses me... but it's not the sort of amusement that one could suitably share with children.
In brief, Miss Giddens...
I am a very selfish fellow... and the last man alive to be saddled so suddenly and so awkwardly... with two orphaned infants.
It's most unfortunate... for I have no room for them, neither mentally nor emotionally.
Does that seem quite heartless?
Honest, but not heartless.
Then the children do not live with you?
No. They are at my country estate in Bly.
A rather large, rather lonely place.
Still, I'm sure you'll agree, the country seems the proper thing for children.
I see from your letter that you are, yourself, the daughter of a country parson... and, um- oh, yes, here it is-
"More than anything,
I love children."
- Yes.
- How remarkable.
For several years now... little Miles and Flora-
Charming names, don't you think- have had only me.
Well, poor brats, they need more than a distant uncle.
Well, of course they need more than a governess.
They need affection and love... and someone to whom they can belong and who will belong to them.
You, Miss Giddens.
I feel that you are that person.
Sir, you- you do realize that this would be my first position.
What does that signify... if I trust you, if you trust me?
You see, Miss Giddens, the person whom I engage... must solemnly promise to accept full and complete responsibility.
She must never trouble me.
Never. Never.
Neither complain nor appeal nor write.
Simply take the whole thing over and... leave me alone.
What do you say, Miss Giddens?
The children, uh-
- Have they had a governess before?
- Unfortunately.
Not that there was anything wrong with Miss Jessel.
She was an excellent governess and a most respectable woman.
The children quite liked her, especially little Flora.
Oh, which reminds me, be careful not to broach that subject to Flora.
She was so fond of Miss Jessel, and... it did come as an appalling shock.
- I'm not certain that I understand you, sir.
She died.
Yes,just when I thought
I'd got the whole situation settled... and everything running smoothly... the confounded woman died.
It was all very odd.
I was in Calcutta when it happened... and have only now been able to seek a replacement.
Meantime, my nephew had to be sent off to school... and the little girl, Flora, is being chaperoned by my housekeeper...
Mrs. Grose.
Help me, Miss Giddens, for truly I am helpless.
Give me your hand.
Give me your promise.
Well, sir... if you are really sure-
Quite sure, and very grateful.
Only remember, you're in supreme authority.
Whatever happens, you must handle it alone.
Yes, I'll try.
I promise you that.
I'll do everything I can to keep the children happy.
Oh, stop. Please stop.!
- Whoa there.
- If you don't mind, I think
I'd like to walk from here.
As you wish, miss. Whoa.
Thank you.
Flora.!
Flora.!
Flora.!
Didn't you hear?
Someone is calling your name.
No, I don't think so.
I didn't hear anyone.
Isn't your name Flora?
I'm Miss Giddens.
Yes, I know.
You're my new governess.
I've been watching the road, waiting for you.
- Are you afraid of reptiles?
- That rather depends. Why?
Because I've got one in my pocket, and he's very eager to meet you.
Well, in that case, by all means.
- His name is Rupert.
- Oh, a tortoise.
- We love each other.
- Yes, I can see that you're very close.
- Very.
There, now you've met Miss Giddens.
But Rupert isn't the only one.
I mean, ever since my uncle wrote... we've all been waiting and waiting for you to come.
Oh, we have been excited.
So have I.
I've been very excited indeed.
Not as excited as we have.
And not as excited as Mrs. Grose.
She's cleaned and cleaned and had all the windows washed.
Just imagine-
1 34 windows!
- All that for me?
- Yes. And I helped!
- Oh, we will have fun together, won't we?
- Yes, we will, dear.
Oh, Mrs. Grose, she's here!
And she isn't afraid of reptiles.
And that's more than can be said of me, isn't it? 
I walked from the gate.
I- I wanted to see it all.
I'm glad to see you, Miss Giddens.
Really, I'm glad.
Oh, do please come in.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
- Oh!
- Now, I expect you'd like a cup of tea.
- Thank you.
- But not you, Miss Flora.
Now, you know you're not allowed in the house with that toad or turtle... or whatever it is.
- Go on. Run along. Off you go.
- Oh, all right.
I had no idea.
I never imagined-
Oh, I'm so sorry.
That's all right, miss.
It's always happening.
I never imagined it would be so beautiful.
Well, we do our best.
Though half the rooms are empty now- locked and empty.
All the same, it's too big, a job to keep clean.
But what I always say is, it's a heaven for children.
Oh, yes, a heaven!
And what an enchanting child she is.
There's not another like her.
Though, mind you, she has her ways.
You have your work cut out.
I don't doubt.
But she seems-
Well, she certainly looks angelic.
Well, she is too.
But she does like to wander, to go off by herself.
- We're always hunting her.
- Oh, yes. I heard you.
Just now, as I was coming through the garden,
I heard you call her name.
Oh, not me, miss.
Perhaps it was Anna or Cook.
Well, someone.
Sit down, miss, and have your tea.
Mmm, it'll be dark in here soon.
I'll get Anna to bring some lamps.
Miss Giddens?
Miss Giddens! Has she gone?
Yes, for the moment.
You don't mind Rupert sharing a bit of your cake, now, do you?
Watch out.
He'll grow too fat to fit your pocket.
- I have a pony too.
- Oh.
He isn't really mine.
He belongs to Miles.
Miles is my brother, you know.
He's away at school.
You must miss him very much.
Well, he'll be coming home soon.
Not, I should think, until the holidays.
Time you went upstairs and got ready for your bath, Miss Flora.
Promise, now, you won't go away.
I expect to be here for a very long time.
And to think what qualms I had.
I was so afraid.
- Afraid, miss?
- I couldn't make up my mind.
Should I accept this post, or shouldn't I?
Well, miss, I'm sure
I'm very glad you did.
After all,
I didn't have much choice.
Their uncle is most persuasive.
And don't I know it.
Many's the time he's worked his magic on me.
Even when he was a boy he could twist you around his finger... and the children are the same way.
He doesn't come down here very often?
Well, he likes the town life.
He always was a very popular gentleman.
And what's the good of being popular down here... with only the children and the pigeons and me?
- Mrs. Grose?
- Yes, miss?
- What was she like?
- Who, miss?
The other governess.
The one who died.
Who, Miss Jessel?
Oh, she was a young woman.
Some thought her pretty, and, well, I suppose she was.
But not as pretty as you, miss.
Not by half.
He seems to prefer them young and pretty.
He did. He had the devil's own eye-
I mean, that's his way, the master's.
- But of whom did you speak first?
- Why, the master, of course.
There's nobody else, miss.
Nobody at all.
Be careful, dear, or you'll splash
Miss Giddens!
And is the other one just as remarkable?
Is he too as enchanting?
Well, if you like this one... you should be quite carried away by Master Miles.
Miles is coming!
I seem to be carried away quite easily.
That's what happened to me in London.
Miles is coming!
Miles is coming!
Stuff and nonsense.
You know very well Miles is at school.
- Now, hold still.
I've got a little bed in your room.
It's got curtains.
- How nice.
- Yes.
Mrs. Grose wanted to give you a big room... but I said,
"She'll only be there when she's asleep."
- Big rooms get bigger at night. Do you know that?
- Do they?
Mrs. Grose doesn't know.
She shuts her eyes in the dark.
I think that's silly.
- I always look in the dark.
- Do you?
And what do you see?
There are a lot of empty rooms.
I said, to Mrs. Grose, "I wish there was some way of sleeping in several rooms at once."
Mrs. Grose was quite startled by the thought.
- I don't wonder!
- "Stuff and nonsense," she said.
"Stuff and nonsense."
Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep-
Why can't Rupert sleep with me?
Because you might roll over and crush him.
Crush a tortoise?
Now finish your prayers, dear.
If I should wake before I-
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
Amen.
Miss Giddens, where would the Lord take my soul to?
- To heaven.
- Are you certain?
Yes, of course, because you're a very, very good girl.
But I might not be.
And if I weren't, wouldn't the Lord just leave me here to walk around?
Isn't that what happens to some people?
Whatever was that?
- I'm sure something's been hurt.
An animal.
We must pretend we didn't hear it.
That's what Mrs. Grose says.
- Pretend?
- Then we won't imagine things.
Sometimes one can't help... imagining things.
[ Sighs,
Moaning Continues ]

- You should be outdoors on a day like this.
I was just practicing, Mrs. Grose.
- Have you seen Miss Giddens, my lamb?
- I'm out here, Mrs. Grose.
Oh!
There's some letters for you, miss.
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, please, can I help you read them?
- Yes, if you like.
- Which first?
Now, how can I tell?
- Then I shall choose.
- All right.
Here.
This one's from my sister.
Oh, look, dear.
Here's a picture of me and my family together.
- Am I in it?
- How could you be? It's of my family.
Oh.
- Now this one.
- It's from London.
- Is it from my uncle?
- Yes, I think it is.
You do look pleased.
Is he coming to see us?
No, dear. He's sent me a letter from Miles's school.
- Flora?
- Yes, Miss Giddens, dear?
Didn't you say last night that Miles was coming home?
Oh, look.
It's a lovely spider... and it's eating a butterfly.
Mrs. Grose?
Here's a letter their uncle has forwarded without opening.
It's from Miles's school.
He just wrote on the envelope,
"Am off to Italy for the summer.
This is from Miles's headmaster.
Deal with it without bothering me."
- That's just his way, miss.
- But how am I to deal with it?
Miles has been dismissed from school.
- Dismissed?
- Sent home.
Expelled.
But what has he done?
What do the gentlemen say?
They go into no detail.
They simply say-
Here. Read it.
Read it for yourself.
It's no good, miss.
I never learned.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize.
They say that it is impossible to keep him.
Why?
That he is... an injury to the others.
Master Miles?
Him, an injury?
Oh, stuff and nonsense.
You might as well think ill of Miss Flora, bless her.
- You've never known him to be bad?
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
You mean you like a boy with spirit.
Well, so do I, but not to the degree to... contaminate.
To what?
To corrupt.
Master Miles?
Oh, miss, are you afraid he'll corrupt you?
Miles is coming.! Miles is coming.!
Miles is coming.!
Bly.! Bly station.!
Miles! Miles!
Miles.
- You're Miss Giddens, aren't you?
- Yes.
How do you do?
Oh, thank you, Miles.
She's our new governess, Miles, and she's awfully nice.
I hope Miles will agree.
- Come on.
Nothing's changed.
Oh, I've been longing for these holidays.
Holidays?
Longing to see Bly and Mrs. Grose and Flora.
And you. Flora wrote and told me you were coming.
Did you have a good term at school?
Look, Miles!
There's the lake!
Oh, it is nice to be back.
I hope you won't be lonely... with just Flora and Mrs. Grose and me.
Were you happy at school?
May I tell you something?
Yes, Miles, of course.
I think you're far too pretty to be a governess.
And I think you're far too young to be such a deceitful flatterer.
- Dearest Mrs. Grose!
- It is nice to be home.
- Stop! Stop! You'll have me out of breath!
It's all just the same.
Somehow- I don't know-
I was afraid it might be different.
Oh, nothing ever changes here,
Master Miles.
You look a bit thin, though.
We'll have to fatten you up.
Oh, Miles, you haven't seen the pony!
- May we?
- Yes, of course!
Come on!
Well, miss?
It's just as you said.
Charm seems to run in the family.
And that cruel letter?
It must be a misunderstanding, a mistake.
Yes, a mistake.
So, uh, what will you say to Master Miles?
I shall have it out with him later on.
That can't be avoided.
But not now.
I'm not going to spoil his homecoming because of some silly schoolteacher.
Oh, yes, miss.
Oh, I- I'm so thankful we're not to have trouble.
Dear Mrs. Grose, what a comfort you are.
Why don't you come in, Miss Giddens.
How did you know
I was there?
This is a very old house.
Things creak.
And anyway, I saw the light from your candle under the door.
You should be asleep.
- I'm much too excited.
- Excited?
By being home. By seeing Flora.
And meeting you.
Besides, I like to lie awake.
That's a very bad habit, Miles.
- Is it?
- Yes.
What do you think about while you're lying awake?
Oh, a world of different things.
And tonight... were you, perhaps, thinking about school?
Oh, no. All that seems very far away.
Miles... you do know that you will not be allowed to go back.
You realize that it is a very serious matter... for a boy to be expelled from school.
I can't think what your uncle will say.
Can't you?
I can.
He'll say, "Don't bother me.
I'm too busy."
- Miles, that's not true.
- Isn't it?
You've met him, haven't you?
You know what he's like.
He doesn't care about me or Flora.
He doesn't care what happens to us.
Miles, dear, you mustn't believe that.
Your uncle has-
Well, he has... a great many responsibilities and not enough time-
To waste any on us?
I understand.
It's a bit sad though... when people don't have time for you.
Oh, I have, Miles.
I have time.
And I care.
And, Miles, if there's something wrong about school... if there's something you want to tell me-
Miles, dear Miles... can't you see that
I want to help you?
Trust me.
The candle's gone out.
Don't be frightened. It was only the wind, my dear. The wind blew it out.

Miles.
How long have you been here?
I don't know-
20 minutes, half an hour.
- Oh, then you must have seen him.
- Who?
The man who was standing here on the tower.
I've been quite alone, except for my greedy friends.
Well, that can't be true.
Not two minutes ago
I saw a man standing exactly here.
Perhaps it was me.
No, no, it was a man.
He was looking at me.
I expect you imagined it.
Or else- Oh, dear.
I hope you won't have to wear spectacles.
You're much too pretty for that.
Oh, yes, I expect I'm tired.
I haven't been sleeping well.
I know.
Flora told me.
She says you make little groans and moans all night.
Of course, one can never believe Flora.
She invents things, imagines them.
You mean, like poor, silly Miss Giddens?
Miss, would these, by any chance, be yours?
Scissors. The gardener brought them up.
He said he found them in the garden.
I must have dropped them this morning when I-whilst I was cutting roses.
And just left them there.
I'm afraid today isn't altogether my day.
I seem to be at sixes and sevens.
Well, miss,you've never been away from home before.
A strange place, new responsibilities.
- Takes a bit of getting used to-
- Mrs. Grose.
Is there anyone living here that I don't know about?
- Living here?
- In the house, I mean.
I've met the two maids, the cook and her husband, the gardener... and I was just wondering if there was someone I hadn't met.
Bless you, miss, I wish there were.
We could use another pair of hands.
- Oh, hurry.! Do come.!
- Oh, hurry.! Do come.!
You must see!
Miles is giving an "expedition!"
Oh, come! You must see!
He's awfully brave!
Miles!
Flora, watch me.!
- Miles!
Miles?
I didn't know you were watching.
That was very clever, Miles.
Do look, Miss Giddens.
I can draw too.
Miles isn't the only one who can draw.
Oh, yes.
Now I see.
It's lovely.
A vase of flowers.
Goodness, no.
It's a thunderstorm.
- See the clouds and the lightning?
- Oh, yes, dear.
Yes, well, I'm sure it's very original.
- Perhaps you'll grow up to be a famous artist.
- Did you hear that, Miles?
Yes, dear. But Miss Giddens is merely being polite.
Tell me, Miss Giddens, what do you think
I might grow up to be?
Anything you want.
There's nothing
I want to be... except what I am- a boy living at Bly.
Oh, if only everything could go on just as it is now.
I love this house.
Don't you, Miss Giddens?
It's very beautiful.
And so large.
I expect it's the biggest house in England.
The whole world, actually.
Oh, hardly the whole world, Flora.
Your house, where you used to live- was that a big house too?
No, it was very small,
I'm afraid.
- How small?
- Very, very small.
Too small for you to have secrets?
Well, secrets were a bit difficult.
 But possible?
- Not for long.
Secrets require a privacy that our little home did not provide.
- Did you play games in your house?
- No.
We had to be quiet, usually, because my father was preparing his sermon.
But if he went out, we'd play hide-and-seek all over the house.
Oh, lovely!
- Let's do that!
- All right.
You hide, and I'll seek.
We can go all over the house, can't we?
- Everywhere, I mean.
- Yes, I should think so.
Oh. Where are the children going?
It's their bedtime.
Yes, I know.
But I thought,just one little game and then right to bed they'll go.
Oh, they've won you over, miss, already, I can see.
They have indeed.
 We're ready.!
- I'm coming!
Anna?
Miss Giddens.!
# 
- You'd never have found me if I hadn't pounced on you!
- Did I frighten you?
- Yes, a bit.
- Now you're my prisoner.
- Oh, Miles!
- Let me go.
- Why?
- You're hurting me.
- Am I?
- Yes, Miles. Please let me go.
- But why?
- I told you. You're hurting me. Miles, I mean it.
- Do you?
- Oh,you've found it.! I've missed it so.
- ##
Mrs. Grose must have hidden it here.
- Now it's your turn to hide.
- Hurry! Run!
All right.
Now where?
- Oh, where shall I hide?
- Wherever you like. We'll count a hundred.
One, two, three... four, five, six, seven, eight... nine, 1 0, 1 1-
Miss Giddens.!
Where are you?
Miss? Miss Giddens?
Whatever are you doing there, miss?
Heavens, child, you're white as milk.
I saw him!
Don't tell me I didn't, because I did.
- I saw him staring.
- Who, miss?
- The same man- the man on the tower.
- The tower?
But now,just now, he was staring past me into the house... as if he were hunting someone.
- What's he like, miss?
- He had dark, curling hair.
- And the hardest, the coldest eyes.
- Is he-
- Would you say he was very handsome?
- Oh yes. Handsome and obscene.
But I've seen him before.
Yes, he-
I know where I've seen him.
A picture. There's a picture of him.
A miniature in a cracked glass in the attic.
- I'll show you.
- It can't be.
- It can't be? You know him.
- Quint.
- Peter Quint, the master's valet.
- But you said-
Yes, miss. You see, he's dead.
Quint is dead.
Dead?
- ##
Your pencil does have the most terrible squeak, Flora.
It does, doesn't it?
But I can't help it, you know.
Can't you? I thought you were doing it on purpose.
She is.
- Stop it! Stop begging!
- I'm not begging!
Yes, you are!
You're begging for attention!
- There you are, begging again.
First for attention, now for affection.
- Stop it, Flora!
- Now, Miles. Hush, Miles.
Oh, darling.
Oh, poor darling Flora.
There, now.
Look, I've made you cry.
Oh, what a hateful, what a grumpy old governess you have.
You're not grumpy at all.
Of course you're not.
Though I wouldn't wonder if you were.
Nor would I, with everything so horrible.
- Horrible?
Why, yes.
You know, the rain.
Not being able to go out in the garden.
My squeaky pencil and me-
I wasn't even trying to be good.
Oh, but you are good.
You both are.
I know what.
Let's put away our books and let's pretend it's Flora's birthday.
- Oh, yes!
- All right, Flora, it's your birthday.
- What would you like to do?
- Have a party.
- A costume party.
- That's a splendid idea!
- Miles and I'll go get all dressed up.
- May we?
- Yes, of course you may.
- Come along then, Flora.
Oh, good.!
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- Where are you going?
- To dress up! You said we might!
- Well, I'll come with you.
No! Then there'd be no surprise!
You wait downstairs! We won't be long!
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.!
I've let them go.
- Go where, miss?
- Oh!
Oh, I've let the children go.
Upstairs, to the attic, perhaps.
- Alone.
- Is that all? They'll come to no harm.
- I can't.
I can't leave them alone, not after the other night.
As for the other night, miss, put it out of your mind.
- Pretend it was part of a dream, which perhaps it was.
- A dream?
Don't you think
I want to believe that?
That it was just the darkness, a nightmare?
But it's no longer dark.
It's daylight. And I know I saw him.
A man, or something that once was a man... peering in through the window, looking for someone.
And if it isn't true, if I didn't see him... how could I have described him so accurately?
Well,you had seen his picture.
Really, miss, you're upsetting yourself over nothing.
You said he was the valet?
Yes, but when the master left...
Quint was alone with us, in charge.
Tell me, how did he die?
Quint?
Out there, miss, on those very steps.
It was winter.
The coldest, blackest winter's night.
The steps were icy.
Quint, he came home late, after we were all abed.
Late, and full of drink.
There was a wound on his head, as if he'd slipped... as if he'd fallen out there in the dark.
I can't forget his eyes.
They were open, filled with surprise... with pain, like the eyes of a fox
I once saw- a fox the dogs had hunted down.
But it was an accident?
He was a peculiar man.
There were things in his life that could account for violence done him... vicious things-
Well, it doesn't do to speak ill of the dead.
The children never mention him?
Oh, no, miss, and neither must you- not to them.
You see, miss, it was Master Miles that found him.
Oh, that poor little boy.
If you could have heard his screams... seen the way he clung to him and begged him to speak-
That poor little boy worshipped Quint.
Worshipped him?
That man? Miles?
You didn't know Quint, miss.
Such power he had over people.
You can't blame the child.
A lonely boy with no father.
Quint took advantage, that's all.
It made me sick to see
Miles trotting after him like a little dog.
They were always together.
- ##
 Quiet, everyone.
- ##
 Quiet, everyone.
The entertainment is about to commence.
Oh, look, miss.
I borrowed your pin cushion.
I hope you don't mind.
Miss Giddens, dear, would you sit there?
And, Mrs. Grose, would you sit there too?
And now Miles will recite to you.
A poem.
What shall I sing to my lord from my window?
What shall I sing, for my lord will not stay?
What shall I sing, for my lord will not listen?
Where shall I go, for my lord is away?
Whom shall I love when the moon is arisen?
Gone is my lord... and the grave is his prison.
What shall I say when my lord comes a-calling?
What shall I say when he knocks on my door?
What shall I say when his feet enter softly... leaving the marks ofhis grave on my floor?
Enter, my lord.
Come from your prison.
Come from your grave... for the moon is arisen.
Welcome, my lord.
Look at that.
- What, miss?
- I was afraid for them.
But what if he knows?
What if Miles knows?
Knows what,
Miss Giddens, dear?
You think I'm imagining it... and yet just now you yourself saw and heard Miles-
Playing a game.
You told me
Quint and Miles were always together.
But Master Miles wasn't to blame for that.
- Yes, but couldn't you have stopped it?
- I wasn't in charge, miss.
It wasn't for me to question the master's arrangements.
The master put Quint in charge here.
Besides, no one could go against Quint.
You were afraid of him?
But what of Miss Jessel?
Couldn't she have done something?
Or was she afraid of him too?
Not at first.
At least-
In the beginning, when she first came here, she was always happy and smiling.
Very fond of music she was... and dancing.
She and Miss Flora used to dance together, dance by the hour.
But she changed.
Oh, yes, she changed.
'Twas hard to believe... her being an educated young lady and Quint being...
- well, what he was.
Stop it, Miles.! Stop it.!
You see? I knew they'd be overexcited.
It's long past their bedtime.
Yes, but what did you mean about Quint and Miss Jessel?
Look, miss, they're dead, gone.
There's no point in telling tales of what's over and done with.
Over and done with?
Yes, but is it?
Let go, Flora. You'll fall in.
But I want to row the boat.
Silly.
You know you can't.
Miss Giddens, tell Miles to let me row.
I will, when you're a little older.
But it's too heavy for you now.
I don't care.
I've got a boat of my own anyway.
Heavenly, warm sun.
It's almost hot.
I like it when it's hot.
- Do you know what Miles told me once?
- No, dear. What?
He said that once, when he was on the lake, he could see a hand waving on the bottom.
But Mrs. Grose said,
"Stuff and nonsense.! Stuff and nonsense.!"
Miss Giddens, can tortoises swim?
No, dear.
I thought perhaps they couldn't.
# # 
# # 
Flora, where did you learn that song?
I don't think I remember.
# # 
It's the song from the music box, isn't it?
Isn't it?
# # 
Flora.!
Who is it?
Over there.
Oh, goodness, miss, you gave me quite a turn sitting there in the dark.
- And where are the children?
- Upstairs with Anna.
I wanted to be by myself for a while, to think.
Well, miss, I'm sure a little light will make your thoughts more cheerful.
Mrs. Grose?
There are two of them.
I beg your pardon?
Two of those abominations.
Today, down by the lake... there in the broad sunlight...
I saw the other one.
- The other one?
- A woman dressed in black.
- Miss Jessel.
- Oh, but Miss Jessel's dead.
She died, why, almost a year ago.
Huh. Almost a year ago.
Almost a year.
Flora saw her too.
- Did she tell you so?
- No, of course not.
She lied to me.
Well, it amounted to a lie.
Oh, now, miss, I've never known either of the children to tell lies.
- Why would they?
- Why?
Because they are both playing... or being made to play some monstrous game.
I can't pretend to understand what its purpose is.
I only know that it is happening.
Something secretive and whispery... and indecent.
I tell you, believe me, the children are in dreadful peril.
Well, what are we to do?
Then you do believe me?
You don't think I'm imagining it?
- I believe you, miss.
- Oh, thank God. Thank God.
I've been so frightened.
I've felt so alone.
But together, with you to help me-
Oh, yes, miss, I'll help you.
Only tell me how.
Yes.
We must try to learn what it is these horrors want.
Think, Mrs. Grose.
The answer must lie in the past.
Were Quint and Miss Jessel in love?
They were in love, weren't they?
Love? Oh, I suppose that's what she called it.
But it was more like a sickness... a fever that leaves the body burned out and dry.
There was no cruelty she wouldn't suffer.
If he struck her- Oh, yes, and I've seen him knock her to the floor- she'd look at him as though she wanted the weight of his hand.
No pride, no shame.
Crawl to him on her hands and knees, she would.
And him laughing at her.
Such a savage laugh he had.
Oh, it hurts me to remember.
Bad she was, but no woman could have suffered more.
Aperson ought to keep quiet about it.
You must tell me.
Oh, miss, there's things
I've seen I- I'm ashamed to say.
Go on.
Rooms... used by daylight... as though they were dark woods.
They didn't care that you saw them?
And the children?
I can't say, miss.
I-I don't know what the children saw.
But they used to follow
Quint and Miss Jessel... trailing along behind hand in hand, whispering.
There was too much whispering in this house, miss.
Oh,yes, I can imagine.
Yes, I can imagine what sort of things... they whispered about.
Quint, Miles.
I can hear them together.
But there was nothing wrong in Master Miles wanting to be with Quint.
Quint taught him to ride and took him walking.
- The poor lad needed someone to-
- To corrupt him?
But Master Miles is a good boy, miss.
- There's nothing wicked in him.
- Unless he's deceiving us.
Unless they're both deceiving us.
- The innocents.
- Innocents they are, miss.
It's not fair.
You have no right to accuse them of-
Oh, forgive me, Mrs. Grose.
I'm not accusing.
I'm just trying to put it together, to understand.
Tell me, were the children happy?
Oh, they seemed to be.
The same as now.
But sometimes I used to wonder if they really cared for them, those two... or if they weren't just using them.
Using them?
Yes, of course they were... and still are.
And in the end, what happened to her,
Miss Jessel?
Oh, that was pitiful.
When Quint was found, she went into blackest mourning.
Her, that should have hated the man.
She grieved till there was something crazy in her eyes.
Never slept.
Never ate.
I used to hear her wandering about all over the house, sobbing.
Couldn't go on.
Finally she died.
Here? At Bly?
But of what did she die?
Well, I suppose you might say a broken heart.
Excuse me, miss.
They're in bed now.
All scrubbed and nice and waiting for you to hear their prayers.
Thank you, Anna.
I shall be up in a moment.
- One thing more before I go.
- Yes, miss?
- Our local vicar, what sort of man is he?
The Reverend Fennel?
Oh, he's a very fine sort of gentleman, miss.
Oh, but, miss,
I wouldn't do that.
I-I mean, if you were thinking of discussing with the vicar what we have been discussing... oh, I wouldn't, miss.
- Why not?
- Well, it might cause talk, a scandal.
Haven't we worse to fear than a scandal?
But what good would it do, miss, telling the vicar our secrets? He can't help us.
He's perhaps the only one who can.
What good would it do, miss, telling the vicar our secrets?
He can't help us.
Only remember, you are in supreme authority.
Shh. Flora, it's a secret.
You must remember it's a secret.
Watch her.
Watch her.
- Flora, it's a secret. It's a secret.
It's a secret.
A secret.
# # 
- I've made up my mind.
Right after church, I shall take the next train to London and see their uncle.
- He must have returned.
- But why, miss? Why now?
Because I-
We can go on no longer without help.
I know you're almost sick with worry, but accept for odd times... you can't say the children haven't been good.
But they haven't been good, merely easy to live with.
Because they are not living with us.
We have no part in their real life.
Dear Mrs. Grose, I know it's hard for you to think wrong of those children... but there are things that I haven't told you... that I can't bring myself to tell even you.
- Look at them.
What do you think they're saying?
Well, I don't know, miss.
Just children's talk.
They're talking about them.
Talking horrors.
So far these monsters have kept their distance.
Only been seen in high places... through windows, across the lake.
But they intend coming closer.
And if they do-
- What will you say to the master?
- Well, what can I say?
That his house is being poisoned?
That the children are a pair of calculating liars?
That they have friends who would frighten them out of their lives... if they weren't deeply and forever bound to them?
Oh, yes, I know, he'll think I'm insane... or that it's some stupid trick to get him to notice me.
Oh, I wish there was something I could do to help.
There is.
Have you told me everything?
If I am to convince their uncle,
I must have the truth.
All the truth.
How did Miss Jessel die?
Please, miss, we'll be late.
How did she die?
# #
In wickedness.
She put an end to herself.
She was found in the lake, drowned.
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.
I-I should never have told you.
I'm glad you did.
Oh, go in, Mrs. Grose.
I'll follow you in a moment.
# #
# #
Flora.
I do wish you wouldn't go, miss. It seems wrong somehow, your hurrying off like this.
I'm left with no choice.
Thank you, Mrs. Grose.
There's nothing else to be done... except to go to their uncle, tell him everything and force him to understand.
- Did you order the carriage for me?
- I did, miss.
I'll go and see if it's come around.
I'll get someone to take your luggage down.
Thank you.
I shall be in the schoolroom.
Miss Giddens?
Miss Giddens?
Are you ready, miss?
I'm not going.
Everything has changed.
Are you ill?
- Where are the children?
- Anna's giving them their milk.
The carriage is ready, miss.
From now on, we must never let them out of our sight.
We can't take the slightest chance.
Of what?
She was here.
She was waiting for me.
Who?
- She spoke.
- She spoke?
It came to that.
Oh, I could feel pity for her... if she herself were not so pitiless.
And hungry.
Hungry for him.
For his arms... and his lips.
But she can only reach him... they can only reach each other by entering the souls of the children... and possessing them.
The children are possessed.
They live and know... and share this hell.
Then surely you must tell the master.
I can't leave them now.
I shall write to him and insist upon his coming down here.
But even if he chooses to ignore me... with or without his help,
I think I know how we can save them.
- Yes, miss?
- They must be made to admit what is happening.
One word, one word of the truth from these children... and we can cast out those devils forever.
I pray to God you're right, miss.
# #
Shh.
Softly. The children are listening.
He had a wound on his head as ifhe'd slipped.
I can't forget his eyes- they were open.
What shall I say when his feet enter softly... leaving the marks ofhis grave on my floor?
Kiss me. Kiss me.
Kiss me. Kiss me.
Kiss me.
Look at the children.
Look at the children.
You're hurting me.
The children are watching.
- The children are watching.
The children are watching.
Haven't they taught you?
Knock before you enter.
Knock before you enter.
Knock before you enter.
[ Overlapping,
Echoing Intensify ]
Love me.! Love me.! Love me.!
Love me.! Love me.!
Quint is dead.
Flora!
Flora!
Somebody's walking in the garden.
Miles.!
Oh!
Miles, what were you doing?
- When?
- You were looking up at the tower.
- You saw something.
- Of course I did.
- What did you see?
- Only you, Miss Giddens.
- I was waiting for you.
- Waiting?
Oh, I knew you'd look out.
But don't you want to know why?
- I'll tell you the real, true reason.
But I wonder if you'll understand.
I'll try.
Well, put me back to bed then, if you're not too cross.
- Are you cross?
- Yes, I am.
I thought you would be.
Come on. I'll tell you when I'm in bed.
- Well, now-
- Yes?
- I wanted you to think me bad for a change.
- For a change?
Well, I thought I might be becoming a bore.
Miles, tell me the truth.
But I am. I mean, good children do get a bit boring, don't they?
So I thought, why not go out tonight and wander about in my bare feet?
It was a shocking thing to do, wasn't it?
Yes, very shocking.
Well, that was our plan.
Flora and I arranged it together.
But we giggled so.
I was sure you must have heard us.
Yes, I-I did hear something.
I told her to go over to the window... then you'd be bound to look out and see me.
Flora's been bad as well.
Miles, what are you hiding under your pillow?
I'm not hiding it.
I'm keeping it warm.
I found it this morning, one of my pigeons.
I couldn't, could I, leave it out there alone?
But, Miles... its neck.
- It looks as though-
- Someone had broken it.
Yes, poor thing.
I'll bury it tomorrow.
Kiss me good night,
Miss Giddens.
# #[ Piano:
"O Willow Waly"]
Are you writing to your sister, Miss Giddens?
No, Miles, to your uncle.
I knew you would finally.
Did you?
I suppose you're telling him what a wicked boy I've been.
It concerns you, in part, yes.
Well, do be sure and give him my love.
Miles, isn't that the tune that Flora's always singing?
- Do you like it?
- ##
Where is Flora?
Isn't she here?
Shall I play you something else?
- Flora!
- ##
Flora!
- Flora.!
Mrs. Grose! Mrs. Grose!
Flora, she's gone!
Miles planned it beautifully. Oh, yes, it was very clever. Quick, we must find her.
- Where?
- By the lake where we picnic.
Where we saw Miss Jessel!
- You see? She's taken the boat.
- All alone, that child?
She's not alone.
And at such time, she's not a child.
- She's an old, old woman.

- Flora?
- Oh, there you are.
I thought someone was watching me.
And who did you think it was?
Why, Miss Giddens, you came out without your hat.
- So did you.
- How did you get here, dear?
- In the boat.
Miss? Miss Giddens?
And when did you learn to row, Flora?
Miles taught me.
Why did you come here?
I always come here when I want to dance, when I want to be alone.
And who gave you that music box?
- I don't think I remember.
- Miss Giddens?
Oh, yes, I do.
It was Mrs. Grose.
- No, it was not.
- Wasn't it, Miss Giddens, dear?
And where, my pet, is Miss Jessel?
- Where is she, Flora?
Miss Giddens?
Where is she?
You know you can see her!
- Miss?
- Look, Flora, look! There!
- You know you can see her.
- I can't! I can't!
Admit it! She's there!
You know you can see her!
- I can't! I can't!
- But look! She's there!
- Stop it! I'm frightened!
- Stop it, miss.
- But you can see her. You must!
Hush, hush, dear. She isn't there.
How could she be?
She's dead and buried.
Hush, little lamb.
I can't see anything! I've never seen anything!
You're cruel! You're wicked!
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!
- Flora!
- Take me away from her.
She's cruel! Take me away!
Please take me away!
Don't look at her! Don't look at her!
She frightens me so!
- Hush, dear. Come on.
- Mrs. Grose!
Come along.
I like it when the fire does that. Don't you?
Shh. Hush, my love. Anna will stay with you.
I've never known the equal.
Never. It's beyond nature.
Now do you believe me?
Now that you've seen?
Now that I've heard.
In all my years- and I've known a vile tongue or two in my time- never have I heard such obscenities.
- That pleases you?
No, of course not, but it justifies me.
It's proof.
Perhaps it is, but to hear such filth from a child's mouth...
I don't know where she could have learned such language.
- I know.
- I never heard her speak like it before. Never.
- Till you came.
- You saw who taught her.
- You saw that woman.
- I know what I saw.
Has she mentioned it?
Mentioned Miss Jessel?
- Only to say there was no one there.
- You pretended to believe her.
I didn't have to pretend.
Well, how can you say that?
As though you-you too were a complete innocent?
Well,you lived here.
You knew those two.
You knew them when they were alive, and what influence they were on the children.
And it frightened you.
When I came here, you were still frightened.
Oh, you were.
I sensed it. And why?
Because you felt they weren't really dead.
And now, despite all that, you turn on me.
You blame me.
And all I want to do is save the children, not destroy them.
- Don't you know that?
- All I know is Miss Flora was a sweet, innocent child... a happy child, until you made her face that-
- That woman! Say it!
- That bad memory!
It may have been the saving of her.
But you must take her to her uncle.
You must both go away tomorrow.
Away from me, away from them, the servants- everyone must go.
Leave you here all alone?
Except for Miles.
We were together this afternoon... sitting in front of the fire.
He didn't say anything... but he wanted to.
It was like a pendulum... and I could feel it swinging my way.
Slowly, slowly.
Oh, yes, he wanted to reveal himself and ask for my help.
And we must give him that chance.
Don't you understand that?
After today, miss,
I doubt I shall ever understand you.
It was a cruel thing.
And if you're planning another cruelty-
But to wake a child out of a bad dream, is that a cruelty?
If you were my age... and had cared for as many children as I have... you'd know that waking a child can sometimes be worse than any bad dream.
- No.
- It's the shock.
And then being suddenly deprived.
No, you're wrong.
You're talking nonsense.
As you say, miss.
You and Flora will leave tomorrow.
It is my decision.
I shall send the servants away.
He put me in charge- in sole charge, Mrs. Grose.
Tomorrow
I must be alone here with Miles.
Miss, may I ask what I am to tell their uncle?
The truth.
The truth?
Yes, miss.
Thank you.
Mrs. Grose, have you got my letter?
- What letter, miss?
- To their uncle. I left it on the desk.
Oh, I haven't touched it, miss.
Well, I wonder who-
Oh, of course- Miles.
- You're accusing him of stealing?
- Well, what matter.
It's just one thing more for us to talk about when we're alone.
- Where is Master Miles?
- He went out early this morning.
But I shall wait for him.
He'll come to me.
Well, I-I suppose
Miss Flora and I had best be on our way.
Give her my love... when she's better.
And, Mrs. Grose, please, wait till you see Miles again... before you judge me.
I can'tjudge you, miss.
A body can only judge themselves.
May God be with you, miss.
So, here you are.
I say, are we having tea in here?
- Yes, Miles.
- How very grand and grown-up.
Yes, and we can talk together now, like adults.
Jolly nice, I call it.
I feel quite the master of the house.
Where are the servants?
They've gone home.
Oh, did you send them, or did they take fright and run away?
What do you mean?
Well, you're afraid, and perhaps you made them so.
And of what- assuming you are right- of what am I afraid, Miles?
I'm not a mind reader, my dear.
I've told you that before.
But I do sense things.
Don't worry.
There's a man in the house.
Is there?
Yes, me.
I'll protect you.
I say, it is fun.
We've got the whole house to ourselves.
More or less.
There are still the others.
Poor Flora.
Is she awfully ill?
I mean, is it serious?
Has she gone to hospital?
No,just to London.
I think Bly didn't agree with her anymore.
- This house upset her.
- Suddenly?
Oh, no, I had seen it coming on.
Did you?
Then why didn't I?
I love Flora, and I know what she feels before she feels it herself.
She loved this house.
She was as happy here-
As happy as I am.
Are you?
- What?
- So very happy.
Are you, Miles?
If you'll excuse me.
- Miles, you haven't-
Poor Flora. She must have been upset to have forgotten Rupert.
Why did you want to be alone with me?
I think you know very well.
What do I know?
Or rather, what is it that you want to know?
Well, for one thing, why that night when you were supposed to be in bed...
- why were you in the garden?
- I told you.
The real reason, Miles.
It's beyond me why you go on asking a fellow questions... when every time he answers you you tell him it isn't true.
Because you are not telling the truth.
Don't shout.
Don't be so angry.
It does something to your face.
It makes you look ugly and cruel.
Miles. Miles, listen to me.
I'm not a cruel person.
I'm sometimes very foolish and I make mistakes... but I'm not cruel.
My father taught me to love people and help them.
Help them even if they refuse my help.
Even if it hurt them sometimes.
And that's the only reason
I'm here is to help you.
Whatever you've done,
I'm not against you.
- I don't think it's your fault.
- But I haven't done anything.
Then why were you sent home from school?
It must be because I'm different.
But you aren't.
You're like any other boy.
Ah, now who isn't telling the truth?
If you really thought that, we wouldn't be having these conversations.
No, my dear, you don't think
I'm like any other boy.
That's why you're afraid.
If I am, it's for you.
And I am afraid for you, Miles.
- If you don't tell me now-
- There's nothing.
Isn't there?
Why did you take my letter?
You did take it, didn't you?
Yes, I took it.
Why?
To see what you said about us.
- Us?
Well, about me.
- And what did you discover?
You thanked my uncle for trusting you.
You apologized for troubling him... for asking him to come down.
Go on, Miles.
What else did I say?
That's all I read. I heard footsteps.
I threw it on the fire.
And did you take other things?
Is that what you did at school?
No, I'm not a thief.
Then what did you do, Miles?
I-Well, I- I said things.
Yes, Miles?
Sometimes I hurt things.
And sometimes at night... when everything was dark-
- What?
- They screamed.
The masters heard about it.
They said I frightened the other boys.
And when... did you first see and hear of such things?
Why, I- I made them up.
Who taught them to you?
I told you, they just came into my head.
What were they?
Shall I tell you who taught them to you?
I won't ever again.
I promise.
Shall I tell you who taught you the things you've done, the things you've said?
- Shall I tell you his name?
- You don't fool me.
- I know why you keep on and on.
It's because you're afraid.
You're afraid you might be mad.
So you keep on and on, trying to make me admit something that isn't true.
Trying to frighten me the way you frightened Flora.
- Miles.
- But I'm not Flora. I'm no baby.
You think you can run to my uncle with a lot oflies.
But he won't believe you, not when I tell him what you are- a damned hussy, a damned dirty-minded hag!
You never fooled us. We always knew.
- Miles?
- Forgive me.
Hush, darling, hush.
- There.
- I didn't mean it.
Oh, it wasn't you.
That voice, those words... they weren't yours.
Forgive me.
Oh, Miles.
Dear Miles, say it now.
Now, while I'm holding you.
Say his name... and it will all be over.
Who?
The man who taught you.
The man you've been meeting... that you've never stopped meeting.
You're wrong!
You're insane!
- You're insane! You're insane!
- His name, Miles!
His name, Miles.
Tell me his name!
- You must tell me his name!
- He's dead!
- Look! Miles, look!
- Look.!
- No!
- He's here! For the last time, he's here!
- No, no, he's dead!
He's here, and you must say his name!
Quint! Peter Quint!
Where? Where?
Where? Where, you devil?
Where?
- He's gone, Miles.
You're safe.
You're free.
I have you.
He's lost you forever.
Miles?
Miles!
Miles.!
Oh!
Oh, no.
That night, penetrating deep into the heart of Transylvania...
...Professor Abronsius was unaware that he was on the point...
...of reaching the goal of his mysterious investigations.
In the course of which he had journeyed throughout central Europe...
...accompanied by his one and only faithful disciple, Alfred.
A scholar and scientist whose genius was unappreciated...
...Abronsius had given up all to devote himself body and soul...
...to what was, to him, a sacred mission.
He had even lost his chair at Kurnigsburg University...
...where for a long time his colleagues used to refer to him as "The Nut. "
Welcome!
Welcome!
Professor.
Quick, quick!
- Hurry, hurry!
- Here!
- No, no, over here.
- Don't push me!
Not against the stove, because of gangrene!
Hot beer!
Hot beer and cinnamon!
Gently.
It will break like glass.
- A mustard bath for his feet!
- His nose as well. His nose as well.
- No! Not the nose!
- Stand him up! Stand him up!
No!
Rebecca! Where is the bikos for the gentlemen, no?
It's ready, it's ready!
We drive on a little further until we get to Bubuski...
Now we get to Fulidnish...
Garlic.
Garlic, my boy. Garlic.
You think...
Without a doubt.
Here.
Here.
Is it finished?
- Yes, it's finished.
- Wait, wait. We don't go to Brevarsky?
To Brevarsky.
- No, no, no.
- We don't go to Iski?
No, no, not to Iski, no.
The whole winter, if need be.
Indeed, the summer as well.
It's a home away from home, no?
- Tell me...
- I'm telling you!
- Listen, you've got-
- The garlic.
- Garlic.
- No, no, no.
- What is all the garlic doing here?
- Where?
Here.
Not garlic, professor.
Please, not garlic.
Is there, by any chance, a castle in the district?
By any chance a castle in the district?
On the word of Yoyneh, there's no more a castle here than a windmill.
Does anybody here know a windmill in the district?
No? You see? And a castle, anybody know a castle?
- There's a castle just over-
- You see?
No castle, no windmill.
Eat, eat, eat.
The bikos is good. You like?
Eat! Look, the little one, he's eating.
There. You see?
You have the best room in the house.
With its own bathroom. Come.
You'll be very warm, nice, comfortable.
Please, just take a look.
I'd forgotten Sarah!
I mean, this bath will be free when this-
I promise, it will be free tomorrow.
Tomorrow, professor.
Use the conveniences in the corridor.
Last door on the left.
Good night, gentlemen.
Dear boy!
All these signs!
All these signs!
We are nearing our goal at last!
We are nearing our goal!
Last door on the left?
We are nearing our goal.
No!
I told you to stay in your room!
- But you always take a bath!
- No!
- I'll give you that bath!
- I won't! I won't, Papa! No!
- I told you, every day you are having baths!
- I won't!
I told you, no bath!
No bath! No bath! No bath!
Now you satisfied. Now you got it.
Incredible.
Read this.
"According to Elibori...
...they cast no reflected image.
Thus, for example, one cannot see them, nor can they see themselves, in a mirror.
In a mirror.
Mirror. Nor in any other object serving the same purpose...
...like water, windowpanes, etcetera."
Water, windowpanes...
What's next? What's next?
Someone is walking in the corridor.
Quickly, take them off! Take them off!
Always singing.
What's my good little fairy up to?
What's she doing?
Your good little fairy is mending your nightshirt.
This nightshirt is mine?
No. Yes?
Right, good. It's perfect as it is.
I'll try it on.
If you try your nightshirt in my room, I scream.
Yoyneh! Yoyneh!
Hurry, hurry!
Forget about the buttons.
That hunchback, Alfred.
That hunchback. Did you notice?
Revolting.
Why were you under the table?
I think we have a clue!
I want you to follow him.
I am not completely daft, you know.
I'm telling you.
Someone last night bashed me on the skull.
I don't see a bump.
I'm not disturbing you, am I?
Not at all. Not at all.
I just don't know what to do with myself.
I get so bored. You can't imagine how bored I get.
Don't know. I'm just not used to being locked up the whole time.
You mean you're always locked up?
At school...
...we had fun there.
We used to skip over the wall.
- Did all kinds of things.
- Yeah?
You know what I mean.
Then Papa...
Don't know what happened to Papa.
My room is full of garlic.
He says it looks pretty.
Pretty.
- I brought it back from school.
- Oh. It's a...
...good one.
- Soft.
- Soft.
Listen.
I adore it.
I got into the habit of it at school.
He's funny, Papa.
You just can't change your habits in a couple of months, can you?
Besides...
...it's good for your hair.
Once a day is the very least.
Don't you agree?
Yes.
Do you mind if I have a quick one?
I don't mind at all, but-
Thank you. You're being very nice.
Could you get me some hot water?
- Where are you going?
- All right, dear, I'm not going!
Thank you.
What about the umbrella?
Are you crazy?
I saw him! I saw him! He's there! There!
Sarah!
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency Von Krolock!
Give me back my daughter!
Give her back to me!
Your Excellency!
Little Sarah! Excellency!
- Shagal, Shagal!
- My little girl!
- Shagal.
- I beg you!
Careful. Take care. Careful.
Careful.
What?
Yoyneh!
Look, Alfred.
They have drained him in the twinkling of an eye.
They are mighty fierce this winter, the beasts.
- We ought to organize a beat.
- Found one in the forest...
...with his throat ripped!
Now they have taken to devouring each other. Poor Shagal.
- To end in the jaws of a wolf.
- A wolf.
A wolf! You blind wretches!
Open your eyes!
You know perfectly well who has been at work.
- Ripped.
- Ripped.
You poor victims of your own cowardice!
Stick it where?
Madam Shagal,
I have already explained...
...the body of Mr. Shagal is destroyed, but one can save his soul...
...by sticking it in.
- Sticking it in?
- Yes.
- Where?
- In the heart.
According to the works of Elibori and my own research...
...it is the only way.
Like this, in one go.
- Not.
- Yes!
The works of Elibori.
In whose heart?
Sticking it in...
...in my Yoyneh's heart?
Stick in my Yoyneh's heart?
You hear, Yoyneh?
This swine wants me to stick this shank in your heart!
You stupid old goat!
Stick it?! I'll stick this...
... right through you, you old fool!
- I will!
You one-eyed, blind...!
One, two, three!
- Great.
- He's gone?
Not bad, this little wine.
Have you got the wrong vampire!
There. In there.
I thought so.
Madam Jackal- Shagal.
We must all get down to work.
Of course we shall need your assistance.
First we must block up the window.
Good. Good. Next, garlic.
Plenty of garlic everywhere.
And some crucifixes.
I'll lend you some.
Tomorrow I will see to the transfusion.
Is everything clear?
Well, let me repeat.
The garlic, window blocked, crucifixer...
...here, there, there.
Professor, the other way around.
Other way around.
- I can feel something soft.
- Where are you?
Here.
Here.
It's a curtain.
There is a door behind it.
I have a funny feeling we are being watched.
Oh, since you are here, my friend, perhaps you could tell me-
So this is how one worms one's way into my castle.
- Well, to be precise, sir-
- Count Von Krolock.
"Professor Abronsius.
Kurnigsburg University."
This alters everything.
I have had the opportunity of reading your work:
The Bat, its Mysteries.
- No, really?
- Remarkable.
I must have a copy somewhere.
I would like you to inscribe it for me.
I- Well, Your Excellency is too kind.
- So you lost your way?
- No. Actually, we were running after-
You were running after...?
A pteropus. Yes, we were running after a pteropus.
Fancy that.
I thought bats fell into a deep sleep throughout the winter months.
Not always, Your Excellency.
Nevertheless, that is what
I read in your book.
Precisely, so you can understand the amazement of my assistant and myself.
We could not believe our eyes.
Isn't that so, Alfred?
- No, we couldn't. It was like-
- Now, imagine, a chiroptera...
...flitting about in December? Incredible.
What's more, it was as big as this.
Wasn't it, Alfred?
- Like...
- Of course, the case is not unique.
In my second volume, actually at the printer's...
...I site several analogous cases supplied to me by reputable colleagues...
...such as Falkman at Munich,
Dr. Athener of Prague.
- Curious.
- Curious, yes, but in no way inexplicable.
I think we can look for the cause in the purely mechanical need...
...to fight against the torpor of hibernation...
...to restore circulation by primary motion...
...to cause the vital limbs to work without thinking.
This, in consequence, makes them fly...
...without being aware of it.
Of course, I only refer to the very rare species...
...not conforming to the laws of hibernation.
Rather like sleepwalkers?
Yes.
Let us say, they fly in their sleep.
I had an aunt who was a sleepwalker.
At night she frequently ran about on the battlements...
...without causing me any surprise, because there was actual contact.
But the walking isn't flying.
How is it possible to avoid an obstacle when flying...
...while being simultaneously asleep?
Your Excellency is a very great authority.
The natural sciences greatly interested me...
...when I was a young man.
My library.
It's at your disposal.
To fly in one's sleep, you say.
How is it possible?
The rays.
- Rays?
- The rays.
Gentlemen, Koukol informs me that your beds are prepared.
Your Excellency, we have kept you up very late.
I'm a night bird.
I am not much good in the daytime.
Their little heads contain a fantastic mechanism, sort of...
Anyway, this mechanism emits the rays, the nature of which escapes me...
...but one thing is absolutely certain, that these rays...
...come into contact with every obstacle in the way and rebound off that obstacle...
...back into their little heads and warn them.
That would explain why they can fly in utter darkness.
Exactly!
Herbert, my son.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Good evening.
Here is your room.
And this one is for you.
- What?
- The rooms...
...communicate.
Good night, gentlemen.
The fellow is no fool, you know.
Did you hear how he held his own on the subject of the bats?
Really sound arguments.
Not like those morons from Kurnigsburg.
- You see, my boy?
- Yeah.
Professor?
Aren't we going to barricade?
No, I don't think that will be very good tactics.
I thought we were going to barricade.
No, the best thing is to sleep with one eye open...
...or to take the watch in turns.
What is it? What is it?
What are you doing?
I'm going to bed.
What has come over you?
Go to your own bed.
- Alone?
- Go.
We can keep the door open.
At the slightest alarm...
...we call out.
Mr. Koukol, I'm not disturbing a soul here.
There's plenty of room.
People can pass over here.
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?
Mr. Koukol, please.
Mr. Koukol, what are you doing to me, please?
I beg of you-
Look, I-
Please, it's not comfortable here.
It's dirty here. Look, the day's coming.
There's too much light here for me. Mr. Koukol...
So now you are satisfied?
What can you do with such people?
Hunchback swine.
What does it cost?
Does it cost him anything?
He should leave me in there.
Why does he bring me here?
Sarah.
Sarah.
He's got a nerve.
- A nerve?
- Von Krolock, he's brazen.
You remember last night?
" I am a night bird.
I am not much good in the daytime."
- That's what he said.
- Yeah? So what?
It's obvious.
During the daytime he rests, he reposes.
- Reposes?
- In the crypt with his fellows.
Maybe there is no crypt in this castle.
Don't be foolish. A castle without a crypt is like a unicorn without a horn.
You're not going to start arguing with me like my colleagues from Kurnigsburg?
Oh, first-rate, this bed.
Did you sleep well?
I heard singing.
Well, that's no reason to look so worried.
I'm sure it was Sarah. Sarah, yes.
- And who is Sarah?
- Sarah, Shagal's daughter.
Oh, yes, of course.
I must confess I rather enjoy luxury.
All these years running uphill...
...and down dale, debating with morons.
Trying to convince a pack of fools.
Oh, and the expense, perpetual expense.
I'm sure it was Sarah.
Do you know what that robber Shagal charges us for board and lodging?
- Her father?
- Four dollars, my boy.
Yes, by Jupiter. Four a day.
Bed without breakfast. The ruffian.
- Do you feel in good shape, at least?
- Yes.
- We've got a lot on our plate.
- To find Sarah?
Now, keep calm. The crypt comes first.
- But what about Sarah?
- We mustn't put the cart before the horse.
- What's he up to?
- He's woodworking.
But it's a coffin.
- Footprints.
- She's dead.
- Eureka!
- Dead. Dead.
Who is dead?
- Sarah.
- When?
- What "when"?
- Sarah's death.
Oh, my God.
- Where is she?
- I don't know.
What are you driveling about? How can you tell me she's dead when you don't know?
- The coffin, it's for her.
- No, no, no, no. They are still working on it.
If she were dead, she would already be in it like one of them, screened from the light.
- She's not dead?
- Work it out for yourself.
You may be sure they'll make her last as long as they can.
It's their idea of fun.
In that case, who is the coffin for?
Oh, for her or...
Don't look at him. Behave naturally.
Recite for me the 12 signs of the Zodiac.
Leo, Virgo...
...Gemini, Cancer, White Boar.
What are you talking about?
No panic.
This lout guards the crypt like a Cerberus.
We must think of a stratagem.
Just whistle as if nothing has happened and let's turn back.
Not so fast.
I'm stuck.
You'll have to help me, my boy.
Imbecile!
I can't get a grip.
You will have to operate on your own.
- Operate on my own?
- Yes.
What has to be done?
The stakes, my boy.
The stakes?
- These stakes?
- What other stakes could there be?
They must be driven in.
- By me?
- They're not going to drive in on their own!
- Not that, master. Please, not that.
- Come on, my boy, show some guts!
I'm here.
First you must remove the lids.
Oh, Mama. Remove the lids?
It's an order.
Go on.
Open it, for heaven's sake!
I can't, master.
For the sake of Shagal's daughter, open it!
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!
Who is it?
- His Excellency.
- Good.
Now, the other one.
And this one?
His Excellency's son.
And...
And what?
- And what?
- Shagal!
He's there?
Very well. Open the case.
Pick up a stake...
...and a hammer.
Now...
...go do the count.
Search for the right spot, in between the seventh and eighth on the left. Don't forget.
Place the stake over the spot.
Not upside-down!
That's it!
Raise the hammer...
...and...
...strike!
Strike!
Oh, mutiny, is it?
I will take an oath if there is mutiny.
Come on, my baby. Hit.
There's a good little scout.
Are you going to hit it or not, you good for nothing-
All right.
Everything back in the case.
It's no use.
You will have to pull me out.
From the other side, dumbbell!
Mind he doesn't catch you.
- Sarah!
- It's you!
Sarah...
I'm going to save you.
We'll go away together.
Where do you want us to go?
I don't know.
To your parents', perhaps.
They said Papa will be coming to see me soon.
They said that?
Yes. You- You've seen my dress?
Beautiful, isn't it?
Very beautiful.
They gave it to me for the ball tonight.
Ball?
The midnight ball.
This evening, here? A ball?
At midnight?
They'll all be there.
But we can still have a dance together, you know?
Sarah, you must follow me.
Follow you?
I beseech you.
Well, tomorrow, perhaps.
But tomorrow will be too late.
Turn around.
Sarah?
May I turn around?
My head is swimming around.
I'm no longer the age for this sort of activity.
Look! How wonderful nature is.
Yes. Wonderful.
The sun is setting.
Glorious! Magnificent!
The sun is setting and they are going to rise.
It's in the order of things.
Oh, what a pity not to have the time.
Once I get stuck into it,
I am engulfed for a week!
This way, master.
Wait.
Pretty well-equipped.
Professor...
Here is Orion!
And here is Saturn, with its ring!
Come. Come and have a look, my boy.
There it is.
Courage, my good woman, courage.
Bless my soul.
Shiver my timbers!
Unless they barricade thoroughly...
I know what I am talking about-
Sarah?
Are you ill?
How pale he is!
I'm not pale.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
I assure you.
You are as white as a sheet.
- No!
- Yes, Alfred.
You must have a rest.
Have a little rest and you'll feel much, much better.
I don't like to see you in this state.
There, now. Feeling better?
Isn't there a ball tonight?
How long they are.
They look like golden threads.
Your lashes.
My lashes?
Golden...
Who told you there's going to be a ball tonight?
Nobody. I'm just guessing.
With a great castle like this, it's possible.
He's just guessing. But it's true.
You've guessed correctly with your pretty head.
Yes, Alfred, there's going to be a ball, and you will be able to dance.
What is it you're clutching there like a little treasure?
Here. Show me.
Alfred, show me.
So that's the big secret.
Somebody is in love.
Somebody's little heart is beating around in their bosom.
Pitter-pat, pitter-pat, pitter-pat, like a rat in a cage.
"Seventieth way:
Place the left arm around the shoulders of the loved one.
Put the left hand on her left shoulder...
...like a little birdie alighting on a branch."
Good. Excellent.
"Then let an angel pass."
Shall we allow an angel to pass?
"Once the angel has passed...
...bend the face towards the locks of the loved one...
...and brush them with the lips."
Close the door!
- Playing games?
- Close the door!
He went berserk.
Did you provoke him or what?
No.
- He got excited all on his own.
- On his own. On his own.
- Oh, I meant to tell you-
- What?
- Elibori's theory is correct.
- Which one?
The one to do with the reflections.
- In the mirror. I was-
- Explain yourself more clearly.
I was in front of a mirror, sitting on the edge of a bed and...
And, well, I was alone...
...yet he was by my side, but nothing from him.
No reflection. Nothing. Blank.
- Not even his clothes?
- Not even his shirt.
I'd love to have seen that.
One doesn't see a thing.
You found something to eat?
I? No.
There is a smell of garlic sausage.
Good gracious!
I'm frightened.
It's quite impressive.
- You think they are all-?
- Undoubtedly!
- Oh, my God.
- You should never have come here.
- So why did we come?
- Ask the professor.
Oh, so you're here. You're here.
If you have no objection,
I'm not hibernating.
- You don't seem very pleased.
- I am surprised.
Keep your surprise for later on, you'll need it.
You didn't foresee this in your second volume, still at the printer's.
It will be my pleasure to fill in the gaps in your learning.
When you attain my spiritual level...
...we shall then have the long winter evenings before us for our discussions.
The long evenings...
...of many winters.
Your young assistant will make an excellent companion for my son.
He's already quite fond of him.
He's told me so. He's a gentle...
...sensitive youth.
In the course of the centuries, they'll learn to know each other better...
...just as we shall.
As brooks flow into streams, streams into rivers...
...and rivers into the sea...
...so our adepts flow back to us and swell our ranks.
Soon we shall be victorious and triumphant!
We shall then hold sway over this Earth...
...which awaits our coming as autumn awaits winter.
Look at him, almost an old man...
...with his flabby stomach and spindly legs...
...bring, with dog-like devotion, a fresh adept...
...who only a few nights ago was under his protection.
Look well at this man who secreted another girl more closely...
...than a miser hoarding his gold.
- Sarah!
But tonight he's happy.
See how he frisks and capers.
I must leave you now.
See you later, gentlemen.
Meditate while awaiting your turn...
...for it would be extremely difficult for you to get away from here.
Unless, of course, you have wings.
Like a bat.
He displeased me as much this evening as he impressed me the first time.
What they deserve is...
...a good cannonball right in the-
Quick, help me turn it around!
A little more.
More.
Would you mind giving me a hand? Good.
Put the wood under the cannon!
Under the cannon, under the cannon.
Takes me for a nincompoop.
That necrophile.
A year ago...
A year ago, exactly on this same night, we were assembled here in this very room.
I, your pastor, and you, my beloved flock.
With hopefulness in my heart,
I told you then...
...that with Lucifer's aid we might look forward to a more succulent occasion.
Cast back your minds.
There we were, gathered together, gloomy and despondent...
...around that single meager woodcutter.
A year has elapsed...
...and although travelers turn up more and more seldom in these parts...
...in spite of this,
I have this evening a great...
...a wonderful surprise for you!
Dearly beloved brethren...
...come closer.
This isn't all.
This isn't all!
Yet another human is at this very moment being groomed.
And!
And! And!
Two more humans are in our hands!
Go on, go on. Have your bath now.
Then turn your back to me.
All those ladies and gentlemen are awaiting you. Listen!
Listen to the music.
Come on, take it off!
- Don't you look.
- I'm not looking, I'm not looking.
- Will I be seeing His Excellency?
- Yes, you'll see His Excellency.
It's for me, this lovely dress?
Yeah, for you, this lovely dress.
And so are the shoes.
I wonder what His Excellency's like.
Look here, what are you doing? Oh, no!
Now, listen, I'm old enough to be your-
I'm still your boss, my girl.
If you do that again,
I'm telling His Excellency.
- Forget your precious Excellency a minute.
- Shagal!
What? Who spoke?
I did!
Who is speaking, who?
How dare you ask questions, you letch!
Please! Forgive me!
I didn't mean to ask questions.
You understand. Thank you.
Have you unhitched the horse?
Horse? Oy. I'll go. I'll go at once!
I'll need it harnessed, you idiot!
- Oh, and Shagal, about that girl...
- Yeah?
- Don't you touch her again!
- I'm not touching! Who's touching?
You're pulling my leg.
You wouldn't do a thing like that to Yoyneh.
Hey. Answer me.
If they had listened to me, all this would never have happened.
Can't we do anything for her?
She's one of them already.
And Sarah?
Quick, professor, quick!
The case.
That damned case.
Why did you have to lose it?
It is I.
Life has a meaning once more.
We are going to save you.
You spoke to her?
I had a word with her.
After a good transfusion...
...and a few days' rest, you will be as right as rain, my child.
We've got a congress in Venice.
The palaces, the sky.
Venice, Sarah, Venice.
The gondolas. The sun. The sea.
At the next turn, we make for the door.
- Light. Life. Love.
- When I say "hop," we make for the door...
... and run for it.
- Our love.
Snatch the girl from them!
Sharpen your teeth!
The bats!
I've never come across such remarkable specimens.
- We haven't got the time!
- I would have to examine them in detail...
...but here and now I can assert we are dealing with Pteropus Poliocephalus.
We haven't got the time.
Go. One, two, three, four. Good.
Go! Go, Koukol, go!
Give them a little hell, fire and blood!
Go! Catch them!
Go on, sleep.
Your...
Your tiny hand. It's frozen.
Professor, she's...
Tiny hand is...
I thought that...
My little hand, my pretty hand.
Soon I will be sleeping-
That night, fleeing from Transylvania,
Professor Abronsius never guessed...
...he was carrying away with him the very evil he had wished to destroy.
Thanks to him, this evil would at last be able to spread across the world.
- What for you want to bury yourself in that island?
Nobody visits Blood
Island, except this ship.
And that is once every six months!
- Why that's a very good question, Captain.
I suspect my husband thinks of it as an act of atonement.
Mostly for me.
- This is something I've been looking fon/vard to doing for a long time, believe it or not.
- Well this is absolutely your last chance.
The search is fine, but they'll find it.
- You know, ljust might take you up on that.
You know you just might have a mutiny on your hands Captain, and I can't say I'd blame the crew.
Gallantry from the Peace Corps?
Why I'm overwhelmed.
Any mutiny, I can handle.
- Maybe I could help the captain keep the crew happy.
I better see to my gear.
Me too.
Would you like me to help?
If you like.
Isn't that what a good wife is for.
Get out of my way.
You can stop that, now get in there.
- Aren't you growing up a little fast, little boy?
You tell me.
Captain, thank you.
- Don't worry about the ship, I'll take care of it.
Carla?
I've never seen so many sad faces.
Sad and frightened.
Then maybe you should remain on board and take up my offer.
- Perhaps if you were a little bit younger, Captain.
Oh Paul don't be tiresome.
Here comes the local rotary club.
Let's go meet them.
This is where you dwell.
My granddaughter and I, we stay there.
- Arcadio, what did those women really die of?
I told you, accident.
What kind of an accident Arcadio?
Oh, here's my granddaughter now, Alma.
Hello Alma.
She's very lovely.
Alma has studied in the mainland, she will be your interpreter.
Besides myself, she's the only one that speaks English on this island.
Not the only one Lolo, you're forgetting Mr. Powers and Goro.
We know that you have come to do us good,
W68T6 your SGFVGHtS.
- Well I'm supposed to say at this point that uh, we're here to serve, not to be served.
I only hope it works out that way.
I too.
- I'm Jim Farrell, this is beside us Dr. Henderson, his wife.
- You're most welcome, it will give me great pleasure to do what I can, to help.
- Well I'm afraid Paul won't be very much help to you in the pleasure department dear, now young Farrell here, maybe you and I could?
Carla.
After a rather hectic morning I had hoped you could manage to forget the subject for the rest of the day.
Well let's get this stuff inside huh?
Oh light, oil lamp?
N0, petroleum.
- Last year when the authorities in the mainland instructed me to provide food and shelter for you, conditions were different.
In what way, Arcadio?
This place was a little paradise.
Last year would have been the time to come.
- I was led t0 believe that we were welcome here, this year or any year.
You still are Mr. Jim.
We are ashamed.
- Alma, we didn't come here expecting to find laundromats and supermarkets.
- We wish we had asked you t0 return where you came from.
Why the ship was still here.
I don't understand.
We have gone back to primitive ways.
There are things which we do now, that we did not do before.
How have you returned to primitive ways?
- It is as my grandfather says, we have returned to the ways of our ancestors, and we are not too proud of it.
- They want t0 know if you're a carpenter Jim.
- N0 I'm classified as an instructor in community action.
In Colombia were I first served they called it uh,
Explain to your people that I'm hereto help them improve their village, not to run it, now this is a health center we're making, next a schoolhouse, maybe even an irrigation system!
But they've got to do the work themselves.
That's the weirdest looking plant I've ever seen, what is it?
Something wrong?
- Made any earthshaking discoveries yet,
Dr. Henderson?
- I won't know until I get this under a microscope.
What time is it?
- It's about 4:30, it's too early for a sunset, but there it is.
Ah, it's so peaceful here.
I'm not one of your specimens Paul.
N0 you're not.
Sometimes I think it would be a lot simpler for me if you were.
Yes I guess it would.
Let's go back before get lost in the dark.
What's the matter?
That thing...
What is it?
Some kind of a land crab I think, but...
Paul, I'm frightened let's go back now.
Paul that sunset.
A trick of the atmosphere.
Is that all it is?
Why is everything so still?
- It's just your imagination Carla, come on.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
I don't know if I want t0.
Come 0n let's get outta here.
Welcome t0 Blood Island.
I bring greetings from my master, Mr. Esteban Powers.
He has a table prepared for you.
Please, follow me.
Well you've gotta admit, he's got style.
- The master regrets the lack of transportation, this way please.
Isn't that some kind of a banana tree.
The bark is definitely.
But that growth there,
I've never seen anything like that before.
Paul, it's moving.
Yes...
Please, hurry.
- Come on we'll have time for a closer look in the morning.
Must be over a hundred years old.
Master, your guests.
Fellow Americans.
I'm Esteban Powers.
Esteban.
Jim Farrell.
- The Peace Corps man?
- Right.
- And Dr. Henderson?
- How do you do?
Mrs. Henderson.
Carla to my friends, and enemies.
- I hope never to belong t0 the second category.
- I don't think you'll ever have to worry about that.
- I must apologize for not having been able to meet you.
I would have wanted to bring all of you here directly, but if it's not too late, I would like to invite all of you t0 stay here for the duration of your visit.
Well I don't know about Paul and Carla, but uh, I really can't even begin to do my work unless I live with the people.
- You don't have to be that democratic do you doctor?
- Well I uh-
- We accept.
Paul you know you'll do much better work after you've had a nice, hot shower and slept in a honest-to-goodness bed.
- Well under those circumstances, how can I refuse?
It's settled then, shall we?
I must warn you doctor that you'll find rne an incurable dilatant,
I'm afraid you'll find me breathing down your neck, Mrs. Henderson.
Jim.
Doctor.
What's that?
Stop it Goro.
This belongs to Dr. Henderson.
It's your flare gun Paul.
I must've dropped it somewhere.
- And the poor fellow happened to pick it up.
You didn't give Bulon a chance t0 return it, Goro.
I hope G0r0's unfortunate display of temper hasn't spoiled your appetite.
Well he is a little different.
He's not as sinister as he seems t0 be.
Fact is, I wouldn't know what t0 do without him.
Appearances t0 the contrary, he would be a top overseer in any plantation.
Your property sir.
Thank you.
I didn't really expect t0 get lost on the island, but ground rules are ground rules.
- Just what do you expect to find here, doctor?
- This island was on the fringe of the atomic radiation area during the bomb tests in the late '40s.
Declared safe, then, as now.
- That's why I didn't expect to find any effect of the bomb tests on the flora and fauna of the island.
Didn't expect?
- I found a crab, an ordinary land crab that had undergone some kind of mutation, and also manifested a very high degree of radioactivity.
- Well couldn't it have migrated from Bikini or one of the other islands to the test area?
- Well assuming that it survived the bomb blast, that would seem like the logical explanation.
Migraine.
Have you found high radioactivity in any other creature on the island?
N0, not yet.
- Then Jim's explanation is probably valid.
- The trouble is, if any other living thing on the island has been affected by atomic radiation, only the crab would show evidence of strontium-90, not any other creature.
Why?
- When a crab molts, it eats its own shell, thereby reabsorbing its own radioactivity.
Well what about the other creatures?
- That would depend on inference or other evidence.
What other evidence Paul?
- You got me there, I really don't know, mutation, possibly.
Mutation?
- Inexplicable organic variations in animal of plant life.
- How long will it take you to determine whether any other creature besides the crab have been affected?
- A day, a month, depends on a lot of things.
- Could this mutation infect humans as well?
I don't know.
- Theoretically, doctor, would it be possible?
Theoretically anything is possible.
- Paul, Paul get it off of me please, Paul!
Paul!
Paul, Paul, help me!
- Come on, come on!
Oh Paul, Paul...
This way.
- Return to your homes there is nothing you can do for them.
Earthquake?
NO-
Paul.
- It's a tropical variety of the.
It's changing shape.
" Ow!
Paul!
Carla first aid kit, quick!
Take it easy I'm not hemorrhaging.
Paul, what's happening here?
- It seems that some living organisms on this island, are undergoing drastic mutation.
Please Mr. Farrell.
- We can't leave those women out there to be murdered.
There's nothing anyone can do for them.
They are dead even now.
- Please Jim, what my grandfather says is true.
- I'm prepared to stop you at all costs, Mr. Farrell.
Listen.
It stopped.
- Must be some way of stopping that animal.
It wasn't an animal Jim.
Well it wasn't a man either, so maybe it was an evil spirit huh?
Please don't be angry.
Are you serious?
Can anyone here be happy or okay, even resigned, to the idea of having himself and his entire family just wiped off of the face of the earth?
- The men survive this because it needs only women.
What do you mean?
What the devil do you mean?
He does not devour his victims.
He merely satisfies himself on them.
But they get torn to pieces.
It is his way of satisfying himself.
- Well come 0n.
- N0!
Can't say that I blame them.
- Paul, if that thing came out of the jungle, aren't we taking an awful chance that...
Well I'm even afraid to say it.
Powers' place is built like a fort, it'll be safer there for you, besides he isn't likely to go out of his mind with fear.
Come on.
Paul.
When we are, if we ever get back-
- Carla, you'd rather scare yourself into a fit if you don't watch out.
I'm not frightened now.
I was thinking of you.
About me?
Now that certainly sounds like a classic hysteria symptom.
- Paul haven't you ever thought of getting a divorce?
Have you?
I, what would I have to gain?
Wouldn't change anything for me.
A divorce would get me off your hands for good.
I don't think I'd contest it.
I just hate t0 feel that
I owe anybody anything.
Don't feel that way then.
- Oh Paul you're such an unbelievable stoic.
Why do you put up with me?
- I wouldn't lose any sleep over that if I were you.
I gave up on you a long time ago.
Sometimes I wish that were true.
What's the point of all of this?
You wanna see me wallow in self pity?
- It could be that, it could also be that in spite of what
I am there's a part of me that's still in love with you.
You couldn't possibly believe that could you?
It isn't easy for either of us, is it?
Paul.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I am sent to escort you, your bags.
- That's the same tree we saw here yesterday, but it didn't look at all like that.
Sometimes Dr. Henderson, the nighttime 0n this island is different to the eyes.
- It could be a lot easier to practice crop rotation with this new irrigation system.
I will tell them.
Sedition in the ranks?
- N0, a private joke, it has nothing to do with the work.
- Okay, let's get this work done huh?
Tomorrow we cut the closed poles for the bamboo network.
The bamboo poles for the closed network.
- However I did send a report through Captain Macbee.
- D0 you offer any opinions in these reports?
They expect me to.
What was your opinion?
That the recent killings may have been committed by a maniac.
A maniac?
A crazed, murderous sadist.
Also a man.
Assuming it was a man, possessing an unnatural degree of physical strength.
Those women were literally torn limb from limb.
Paul.
- Master, I am on my way to the wine cellar.
How about a little sherry before dinner?
- I'm sorry, I suppose I'll get used to him eventually.
- Come, we'll have a better view of the sunset over there, unmatched by any other sunset in the world.
It's beautiful.
I'm puzzled by this, Esteban.
Today's sunset is well, breathtakingly beautiful of course.
But otherwise, it's quite normal.
Yesterday the very air we breathed seemed to have a gloomy atmosphere.
- Like a mortuary light reflected from a corpse.
I'm sorry but that's the way I felt yesterday.
All in the eye of the beholder.
I've lived here practically all my life and I assure you
I've never felt that way, there as I said, unmatched by any other.
Alma?
Alma, Alma!
Look listen to me, look we can fight this thing, whatever it is, we can destroy it.
Look, just trust rne huh?
Just let rne go, I promise you you won't regret it, ljust wanna help you, ljust wanna-
Mr. Farrell, no!
- I don't wanna fight you Arcadio, but I will.
Jim, you'll endanger the village.
Jim!
~ Jim?
It's over you're safe now.
But you don't understand...
It's all right, come on.
Open up, open up, it's Alma!
Jim, they won't let us in.
Here.
They're gone.
They don't like what you've done.
Here put this on, hurry.
It's awful quiet.
- The evil has lifted, We can go to the jungle now.
You mean run away?
We'll both be killed if we remain here.
By who, your own people?
- They believe that the evil one will come back and that it's angry on the entire village.
- Then we gotta make
'em realize how foolish and dangerous it is to believe that.
Jim?
Stand back.
~ Jim?
I'm afraid.
- Why?
You'll be safe in that house, safe from the evil one, safe from your own people, come on.
- Welcome to the master's house, Mr. Farrell.
- We've come to accept your master's hospitality, if his 0ffer's still open.
Of course, this way.
Please, sit down.
- Hello Carla.
- Well hello indeed!
This isn't a social visit, is it?
Have you been a naughty boy Jim?
We defied the wicked spirits, we got the whole village chasing us, where's Esteban?
- He's not feeling well, he had some type of an attack last night, he calls it migraine.
Paul thinks it's epilepsy.
Is Paul asleep?
- Oh no, he'll be awake for the next three days, he's quite excited about the little monster he's captured.
- Hey Jim, wait till you see what I've got, come here, you've never seen anything like this in your life.
Carla tells me you caught a monster.
A cockroach straight out of H.G. Wells.
Well, a cockroach all right.
You should've seen this little beast, had horns and fangs, and even tried to attack a lizard.
You saw it, didn't you Carla.
Jim I did see it.
- Could somebody have substituted this one for the one
You've got?
- What on earth for, I was here all the time,
I only left the room just now to call you in here.
- Well maybe it mutated itself back to its original shape?
If that's possible.
I've seen it happen to a banana plant, even t0 the very air we breathe around here.
- If you do not mind sir, I shall show you t0 your rooms.
What about Alma?
There's a vacant room, next to yours.
Good come on, good night Paul, Carla.
Uh Goro what do you want?
- The master is not to be disturbed Mrs. Henderson.
- I uh, just wanted t0 know if he was awake.
- You're Arcadia's granddaughter aren't you?
Yes sir.
Please forgive me for intruding Mr. Powers.
You're most welcome here, Alma, for as long as you care to stay.
Thank you sir.
- Goro tells me that the villagers are after you, is this true?
- Yeah I seem to have offended the evil one when I cut her loose last night.
This is really quite terrible.
It's idiotic of me not to have a radio transmitter.
As it is we're completely cut off.
- Well what about those fishing boats out there?
The?
It's over 300 miles of rough and open sea t0 the nearest large island.
We haven't got big enough to make the crossing.
So we're trapped?
In the meantime this beast just continues t0 wallow in an orgy of blood.
Has anyone ever seen him or it?
I don't know of anyone alive who has.
I fainted just before he could get to me.
- I'm thinking of setting a trap for our monster, with the villagers' help.
- I doubt if you can even get them t0 come out of their homes right now.
- When I am ready I will just have to make them.
- Paul, please don't stray too far away from the house.
- Don't worry there isn't a monster a live who can outrun me, but I'll stay close.
I could keep you company if you're sure
I won't be in the way.
- Well I wouldn't wanna take you from your work.
Oh there isn't that much for me t0 do.
- Oh but Esteban you said you were gonna show me your wife's mosaics.
They'll still be there when we get back.
I do need to get out of house, Paul.
- Well I won't pretend
I wouldn't feel better having you around.
- You know I haven't used one of this in a long time.
Let's hope we don't need it.
And that, if we do need it, it can help.
Now here's another one that died before it had a chance t0 revert back to its original nature.
In your long experience Paul, have you run across anything like this before?
Never.
Even in circumstances exactly like this.
I can't even begin to form a theory until I have a pattern, for one thing, why haven't the people on this island been affected by mutation?
That's easy, they weren't on this island when the bombs were exploded on Bikini.
- You mean they were evacuated and then returned when the island was declared safe?
- N0, they'd never set foot on the island before the test.
They were sent from resettlement centers after the explosions.
- Then they couldn't possibly have been affected by the bomb tests.
- So you do tend to favor the notion that the tests had something to do with causing this mutation?
- For the time being, yes, but we don't have enough evidence t0 support the wildest theory.
She was an extremely gifted woman.
Strange, there's a very strong Spanish influence in her work.
Not so strange, she was a Spanish.
I'm half Spanish myself you know.
My mother's forebearers were the first Europeans t0 come to this island, first to settle here.
They established a rather important trading base, built this house, then my father came along and met my mother who was an only daughter, end of Spanish regime.
- But you were educated in the States weren't you?
- Not really, a couple of years of college.
Then I went t0 Spain, the
Royal University of Barcelona.
That's where I met Beatrice, my wife.
We were both very young.
But when the war broke out, everything seemed so-
- Wait a minute are you talking about the Spanish Civil War?
Yes.
That was 30 years ago.
So it was.
- But uh, that'd make you closer to 50 at least.
You're right again.
But that's incredible.
You don't look a day over 30.
Welcome to Shangri-La, my friends.
- If you'll excuse a rather indelicate non-sequitur,
Esteban what did your wife die of?
N0 one knows for certain.
She developed a fever, we flew her back t0 the mainland, but the doctors there couldn't do anything for her.
And then her complexion suddenly changed.
Changed, in what way?
Discolored.
She grew darker by the day, almost by the hour.
In spite of the fever, which she couldn't shake off, she seemed quite well otherwise.
Then one day, suddenly, she died.
She died in, in terrible pain.
The pain came all at once and simply overwhelmed her.
Forgive me my stupid curiosity.
- N0, please don't apologize,
I want to talk about it.
- Did your wife die within a year of the bomb tests?
I knew you'd ask me that.
It was our 15th anniversary when Beatrice talked rne into taking a vacation.
A cruise among the islands.
We had a 30 foot boat, no radio.
And we learned much later that we had come within range of radiation area.
But you weren't affected in any way.
I suspect all I got out of it, was this, this schoolgirl complexion.
Master?
It is time again for your medicine.
Esteban!
Jim, Jim wake up!
- What's the matter?
- Carla's missing!
Did you look around the house?
- Yes I've looked all over the house, I'm going out.
- Wait a minute wait a minute, look before we go stumbling out in the jungle in the middle of the night, did y0u-
I've looked in Esteban's room, he's not there neither is she.
- Is anything wrong?
- Carla's gone.
Sorry I woke you Alma.
You need not be, Mr. Henderson.
My flare gun's missing.
Here take this.
Stay close t0 me huh?
' Carla?
Carla!
- She can't go on any further, let's go back.
But what about Carla'?
- We don't even know where t0 start looking for her, we're just running in a panic.
" Jim!
Carla!
- Paul wait!
- Jim!
Carla, Carla?
Carla answer me it's Paul, Carla?
Carla!
Paul?
Dr. Henderson.
Where's Carla'?
- Return to the house, Dr. Henderson.
What have you done with my wife?
What have you done with her?
It is no use, you are too late.
He's coming back.
~ Jim?
Esteban?
I had an attack.
Epilepsy.
Woke up in the middle of the jungle and...
Who is that?
Paul, Goro killed him.
Goro'?
Are you sure?
We saw it happen Mr. Powers.
- I think I wounded him, he couldn't get very far.
I didn't expect this of Goro.
But now we've got to stop him before he can harm other people.
It's all right Jim, I think
I can manage by myself now.
_ Qkay-
Esteban!
I can't find my flare gun.
I slipped, hurt my arm,
I'm afraid we have to wait till morning.
Esteban we can't!
Look there's no telling what
Goro might do, even now.
I'm sorry.
Well let me take a look at it.
- N0, no!
- Jim...
_ Qkay-
Jim wait.
It seems to be coming from the house.
Yeah.
Well we can't stop now, at least Esteban's armed. we gotta figure out some way of reaching the village.
~ Jim?
Jim!
Alma?
Alma!
Leave me Jim, it's me he wants.
We're almost there, get up!
Master you are safe now.
The sickness will pass away as always.
Arcadio, Arcadio!
Lolo, Lolo open up!
Lolo we need your help.
- You have endangered your people twice already.
I must return you to your place at the altar.
" N0!
Now you listen to me, if we fight this monster together we can defeat it!
You say that once before!
Yeah!
And you did nothing.
You preferred t0 quake like frightened women here in your homes.
What can we do now?
Alma's in there, we gotta stop it!
Alma!
- Yes?
- I wish to see don Medina.
- My name...
- I'm sorry.
Don Medina is not receiving visitors at present.
You will announce that
Mr. Francis Barnard...
...has come from England to see him.
What do you think you're doing?
Remove your hand, sir.
Maximillian.
What is it ?
This gentleman demands to be admitted, Dona.
- I've told him...
- You are Dona Medina?
I am.
I am Francis Barnard,
Elizabeth's brother.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Won't you come in, Mr. Barnard?
Please forgive me.
I'm Catherine Medina.
Dona.
Would you not spend the night
Mr. Barnard?
I am certain my brother would wish it.
Perhaps Dona. May I see your brother now?
He is resting.
He has not been well since the death.
I see. When may I see him?
Perhaps at supper...
...if you will do us the honor.
I will... supper.
May I visit my sister's grave, now?
Grave?
I presume there is one.
Not as such, Mister Barnard.
She is interred below.
A family custom,
Mr. Barnard.
I see.
If we may go there then?
Please follow me.
When did she die?
Your brother's letter made no mention of the day.
About three months ago.
Three months? Why wasn't I notified sooner?
I'm afraid I...
How did she die?
I know very little of the details, Mr. Barnard.
This is no longer my home, you see?
I left it several months before...
...Nicholas married your sister.
Meaning you don't even...
Damn Heaven!
What's that noise?
Please follow me, Mr. Barnard.
Not that way, Mr. Barnard!
Who are you?
This is Mr. Barnard, Nicholas.
Elizabeth's brother.
Oh, yes.
You are welcome, mister.
Resting, dona Medina?
Sir?
I told Mr. Barnard that you were resting, Nicholas.
I thought that you were.
That noise, sir.
This is an apparatus...
...that must be kept in constant repair.
What brings you to us?
Elizabeth was my sister, don Medina.
I received your report of her untimely death...
...the report that was utterly devoid of detail. what should I have done, remained in England?
Yes, you are quite right.
My apology, sir.
Shock and grief...
...restrained me from more adequate communication.
You have every right to be provoked.
Perhaps you will show me my sister's place of interment now.
I told him it would be alright, Nicholas.
Yes, of course.
Now perhaps you'll be good enough to tell me how my sister died.
In the illness of some duration, sir.
And was this illness diagnosed?
- Yes.
- By whom?
Dr. Leon, the physician of repute.
And he decided?
Something in her blood.
Yes?
That's all?
Just something in her blood?
I'm afraid so.
And I'm afraid that does not satisfy me, sir.
Follow me.
May we go now, Mr. Barnard?
This is very painful for my brother.
And for me...as well.
This form of burial...
...is our family custom,
Mr. Barnard.
Will you stay the night with us?
The night...
...and more, sir.
Until I know exactly what has happened to her.
Thank you.
Yes?
I trust that you will be comfortable here.
Is this you?
No.
No, that is my father,
Sebastian Medina.
Sebastian Medina, yes.
The resemblance is remarkable.
Yes.
And the other is my uncle Bartholomew.
Mr. Barnard, I am aware, painfully aware...
...of your distrust regarding
Elizabeth's death.
Her death was, and is, anguish to me.
I beg of you do not add to it...
I'm sorry, don Medina, but your word is not enough.
Too many things need fuller explanation...
...before I can be satisfied that what you say is true.
Fuller explanation?
Yes.
Come with me.
Please, come.
The atmosphere is heavy in here.
Why have you brought me here?
It is her room, sir.
I've had it kept exactly as she left it.
Look around you sir.
This room was furnished and arranged with dedicated love.
Every article of furniture every decorative detail...
...is the work of a master craftsman...
...of Italy, of Spain or France.
Indeed every country in the civilized world...
...is represented here.
It is unique room.
I did it all for her.
I wanted her to have something that...
Maria
I beg your pardon, sir.
I was just cleaning up.
Oh, yes, yes of course.
You may go now.
Is this all you meant to tell me?
You are an unyielding man,
Mr. Barnard.
I am forced to be, sir.
God is my witness
I worshipped your sister
I worship her still.
Without her, life is meaningless.
She was that substance of loveliness.
I tried to capture it...
...but it was the way she walked and moved...
...her smile, her voice.
She sang like an angel.
And she could play the harpsichord...
...as no other woman I've ever known could play.
Every night after we have dined...
...she would play for me.
Please, forgive me.
I have not intended to so display myself.
I pray...
...I pray you leave me for awhile.
Please, go.
Do you live in London, Mr. Barnard?
Yes, and you?
In Barcelona, with an aunt.
And have you been here long?
A little over a week.
I came to be with
Nicholas because I...
Who would that be?
Nicholas.
How are you, my friend?
You look pale.
Slept badly, have you?
Charles, we have a visitor.
Well, splendid, splendid.
- Exactly what you need.
- Charles.
It's Elizabeth's brother.
- You mean...
- Yes.
Dr. Charles Leon at your service, sir.
Doctor.
You are I understand it
Elizabeth's brother.
The resemblance is clear.
The coloring, the same configuration.
Beautiful woman your sister.
- Doctor.
- Ah, dear.
I interrupted your meal, I see.
Proper timing was never my fault.
We have just finished. Won't you join us in a glass of wine, Charles?
Delighted.
So, young gentleman, you've come all the way from England, then? 
That's right.
Terrible tragedy your sister's death.
Appalling business.
How are things in Baztan, Charles?
What?
Always, always, Nicholas...
...buying and selling living and dying.
The weave of life.
Why did my sister die,
Dr. Leon?
Have you not been told?
- Of course he has.
- Well then?.
I want to hear it from you doctor.
Her death was inevitable,
I fear...
...under the circumstances.
This castle, this odious atmosphere.
What has the castle to do with it?
What has the castle...?
It's too late now, Charles.
I did not want him to know.
Know what?
Your sister's death was caused by failure of the heart, sir...
...due to total shock.
Literally, she died of fright.
- Why did you not tell me?
- I thought to spare you, sir.
You thought to deceive me!
- That is not true.
- What is all this?
Show me where it happened.
- Very well.
- No, Nicholas.
There is no other way, my dear.
We were wrong, very wrong to have kept the truth from Mr. Barnard.
Now we are doubly suspect in his eyes.
Suspect?
Come.
Nicholas, you should not be doing this, you know.
- You are not well.
- It cannot be avoided, Charles.
Come.
Well?
Torture chamber?
Yes, Mr. Barnard.
It was my father's.
Sebastian Medina.
One of the inquisition's most infamous, degrading...
- Sir, that is enough.
- Mr. Barnard, can you not see?
What was my sister doing here?
She could not keep herself away.
That noise I heard, is that what was...
No, sir. That particular device...
...was not in operation at the time.
Which device?
It's in the adjoining chamber down there.
Please, Mr. Barnard, do not go there...
I do not wish to discuss it.
The story, sir.
In detail.
This was my father's world,
Mr. Barnard.
Spare yourself at least this, Nicholas.
How can I spare myself?
Was he not my father?
Am I not the spawn of his...
...his depraved blood?
His depravity is not yours, Nicholas.
Why scourge yourself because of it?
You have not answered me, don Medina.
I shall not dwell upon the history of this...
...this blasphemous chamber.
Suffice it that the blood of a thousand men and women...
...was spilt within these walls.
Limbs twisted and broken!
Eyes gouged from bloody sockets...
...flesh burned black.
Why are you telling me these things?
What do they have to do with my sister?
She had never been brought here.
She was too sensitive, too aware.
Aware of what?
The malignant atmosphere of this castle.
It destroyed her.
My sister was a strong and willful woman...
...not subject to the influence of atmospheres.
You have been here only a matter of hours, Mr. Barnard.
You cannot know what it is to live here...
...month upon month, year after year...
...breathing this infernal air...
...absorbing the miasma of barbarity...
...which permeates these walls...
...particularly this chamber.
But it did not bother her at first either.
Our life was good...
...rich with the shared pleasures of our love.
Each morning I would bring her breakfast.
In the afternoons, she usually sat for me while I attempted all in vain...
...to capture her beauty on canvas.
I did that portrait which you saw on her room before...
...but it is all inadequate to what I called the loveliness of her.
We dined, sometimes alone, enjoying intimate conversation...
...sometimes with the doctor.
And every night
Elisabeth would play for me.
Life was simple, quiet, richly pleasurable...
...and then the darkness began to fall.
More and more entering her room in the mornings...
...I would find her awake and discover that she had not slept all the night.
I tried to find out why, but she had no explanation.
Her appetite began to fade.
She began to lose weight and color.
I tried to make her eat...
...but something kept her from it.
I would come upon her wandering in the corridors at night.
I tried to find out what was wrong...
...but she never had an answer...
...except to say that... that something was oppressing her.
Oh God, help me for my blindness.
I should have known...
Then one day she disappeared.
Frantic, I searched the castle for her.
And then I knew.
The castle and its awful history had obsessed her.
These very instruments of torture...
...which were my birthright and my curse...
...now tormented her as well...
...infecting her with a kind of haunted fascination.
And watched her drawn to one and then another...
...as if the aura of pain and suffering which surrounded them...
...was luring her to sickness...
...and to death.
Immediately I made my plans to leave the castle with her.
We would travel for a while, restore her spirits...
...and then make our home elsewhere.
Then on the very eve of our departure...
...we heard her scream from below...
...the most hideous blood-chilling scream...
...I have ever heard in my life.
Just before she died, she whispered a name.
Sebastian.
Sebastian.
Mr. Barnard.
Dona.
May I speak with you?
Yes, of course.
How is your brother?
Better, thank you.
Dr. Leon is staying with him.
I have come to ask you to please believe him, Mr. Barnard.
He has told you the truth.
Has he?
Yes. And not telling you before...
...he only meant to spare you pain.
He is a good man, Mr. Barnard...
...a kind and gentle man...
...and I know that he adored your sister.
I would like to believe him,
Dona Medina...
...but I find it very difficult to do so.
There is something about him
I cannot help at sense...
...kind of fearful tension that...
I am sorry...
...but an air of definite guilt.
Of course he suffers from guilt
Mr. Barnard...
...because of what our father did...
...because of what happened to
Elizabeth.
Perhaps it will help you to understand...
...if I tell you something that happened to Nicholas...
...when he was just a boy.
One day, while Nicholas was playing...
...in a lower corridor...
He had been forbidden by our father...
...to enter this chamber at any time.
The curiosity of youth, however...
...overcame his fear of challenging our father's discipline.
He had to see the chamber.
Suddenly, there were footsteps.
It was our father.
With him were our mother and our uncle Bartholomew...
...who was our father's brother.
At first it appeared that for some inexplicable reason...
...our father was actually...
...conducting them on a tour of his ghastly chamber.
Nicholas could see that both our mother and our uncle...
...were uneasy, frightened.
Our father's smiling affability...
...as he described the workings of these hellish instruments...
...turned Nicholas' blood cold.
He watched them with a mounting sense of premonition.
Something was wrong, most terribly wrong.
Even he, no more than
10 years of age...
...could sense it like a darkening vapor in the air.
There was no reason...
...for our mother and our uncle to have been there.
As he struck, he kept on screaming at his brother...
...one word, over and over.
"Adulterer! Adulterer!"
And then he turned on her.
Accusing her of vile debauchery with his brother...
...cursing her as faithless...
...promising her the agonies of hell...
...and payment for her infidelity...
...and then before my brother's very eyes...
...our mother was tortured to death.
Ever since then...
...Nicholas has been unable to live as other men.
Always he is haunted by the memory...
...of that terrible day..
Your sister's death...
...came very close to driving, him insane, Mr. Barnard.
I beg of you...
...have pity on him.
Help him by believing him.
I will try, dona Medina.
Well, I know you must be very tired from your journey.
Good night.
Dona.
Who is that?
I'll see.
Where's Nicholas?
He is gone?
I must have dozed off in that chair...
...and I heard...
I don't understand.
It is surely your brother.
No, Nicholas has never played the harpsichord in his life.
Maria.
I heard the playing, sir.
Go back to bed, child.
Nicholas!
It was Elizabeth.
You saw her?
I did not have to see her.
I know her playing
Locked?
Yes.
Is there another door?
There is not, sir.
My sister's?
Easy, easy.
It was she.
Up, take this.
Thank you.
Hers?
Yes.
You will sleep in a minute or so.
Doctor, will you stay please?
Yes, of course, my dear.
Until the morning, at any rate.
My dear Lord.
It is hers, isn't it?
- It is.
- But how?
Let us not talk yet.
May we use your room, sir?
Yes, of course.
Sit.
What I am about to tell you...
...no one in this world except
Nicholas and myself knows.
That is, I thought that no one else knew.
Take this.
No, thank...
Drink it.
To be absolutely blunt about it...
...Nicholas believes that Elizabeth may have been interred prematurely.
What?
I hasten to assure you both...
...that such is not the case.
Elizabeth was quite dead.
I would stick my reputation on that fact.
Then why...
...does he believe it?
Because of what happened to his mother many years ago.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I told mister Barnard what Nicholas saw that day.
No, my dear. Your mother was not tortured to death...
...as you were told.
But...
She was tortured, yes...
...but not to death.
Do I make myself clear?
Do you mean to say that...?
Your mother was walled up in her tomb while yet alive.
Oh, no.
From that day forth...
...the very thought of premature interment...
...was enough to drive your brother into convulsions of horror.
Nicholas broods about it constantly.
Already he has told me he has heard Elizabeth's walking the corridors...
...even that he has heard her speaking his name.
- Dr. Leon.
- Sir?
You seem to forget that we all heard the harpsichord playing.
No, I have not forgotten that, sir.
It is why I said before that I thought...
...that no one but Nicholas and myself knew about this.
What do you mean?
Someone, I fear, has discovered
Nicholas' secret...
...and is using it as a terrible advantage
The servant, perhaps.
I could almost more easily believe that...
That what, Dona Medina?
Nothing.
I spoke without thought.
I want to know one thing, sir.
Are you absolutely positive...
...that don Medina's dread is unwarranted?
If Elizabeth Medina walks the corridors of this castle...
...it is her spirit, not her living self.
- Where did it come from?
- Elizabeth's room.
What is it, child?
Easy, child. Easy..
But tell us what happened to you.
I... I... I heard her.
Heard?
The mistress.
I was cleaning up the room...
...and she spoke to me.
She called me by my name, Maria.
She said, "Maria, leave this room".
My wife spoke to you?
-My wife spoke...
-Nicholas!
No one will ever enter that room again.
- Mister Barnard, I...
- No need explaining, Nicholas.
Mister Barnard knows everything.
Take care of the girl, will you Catherine.
I'll see to it, dona Medina, if you want to go with your brother.
Thank you.
Come, Maria, let me help you downstairs.
Perhaps I should bring some food to Nicholas.
He will not eat it, my dear...
...any more than you are eating yours. 
I am not hungry.
You need your strength, nonetheless.
If I may interrupt this fascinating conversation for a moment...
...how long, may I ask, you intend to accept these occurrences...
...face value?
I should have thought, mister Barnard that a man of your investigative zeal...
...would have already solved the mystery.
And have you, doctor?
I am not certain.
But you remember that no one actually heard Elizabeth's voice?
We have only Maria's word for it.
We proceed on similar lines, doctor.
On questioning Maria, I asked her to describe the voice she heard.
- And?
- She could not describe it, doctor...
...because it only whispered to her.
This point seems of vital import to you, doesn't it?
Don Medina!
Don Medina!
The key to Elizabeth's room..
The key, I said!
Again?
Do not go there, Nicholas.
I must, Catherine.
Nicholas!
Come.
What I have dreaded all these months...
...has come to pass.
You are wrong, Nicholas.
No. She haunts me...
...because of the terrible thing
I did to her...
Mister Barnard!
What in the name of heaven?
And have you nothing to say, don Medina?
I don't understand, sir.
Do you not, sir?
Then, with your permission, I will enlighten you.
What is the meaning of this?
The meaning, doctor, is this: only one person in this castle...
...could have caused all these inexplicable occurrences.
That person is don Medina.
- What?
- You are mad, sir.
Am I?
Mister Barnard, I swear that I...
The secret passage, sir...
...how convenient for you.
Enabling you to whisper to
Maria without being seen.
Then after the door to Elizabeth's room had been...
...locked by YOU, enabling you to return there and...
...at your leisure demolish everything.
- You are wrong, sir. I swear I...
- You are lying, sir!
When Maria screamed, where were you?
When Elizabeth's room was being torn apart, where were you?
How you are not investigating that?
I was afraid.
You lie!
Both times you were in
Elizabeth's room yourself!
Both times your own door was locked...
...protecting you from discovery.
No, that's not true! It's not true!
Why should Nicholas do these things?
Why!?
Is it possible?
Is it possible I am doing these things unaware?
To punish myself?
No, Nicholas!
One of the servants was responsible
Most likely Maria.
Could I have kept that ring without knowing it?
Play the harpsichord without knowing it?
Destroy Elizabeth's room all without knowing it?
My inner mind...
...creating evidence of Elizabeth's vengeful return....
...because that mind knows...
But I don't know!
I will find out.
No.
It's the only way, Catherine.
And it's the only way I...
I must be sure!
I must be sure.
Can you not stop this?
I do not believe I wish to stop it, my dear.
If this is the only way of convincing Nicholas...
...that he did not bury his wife alive then
I say by all means- do it.
This groundless dread...
...must finally be put to rest.
We will exhume Elizabeth.
True.
True!
I swear to you I thought she was dead.
On my honors of physician I thought she was dead.
I swear to you!
True.
True.
True
It's true.!
No, Nicholas!
It's true.
Nicholas!
I killed her.
I killed her.
No, Nicholas.
I killed her. I killed her.
Nicholas.
I would suggest, Nicholas, that you leave this place.
Your remaining here cannot help Elizabeth now.
Try to understand, Nicholas.
I am a doctor of medicine.
Never in my career have I seen a condition which so completely...
... paralleled the physical appearance...
...of dead.
You cannot feel responsible, Nicholas.
While we were up here mourning...
...and she was alive, struggling to be free.
I am responsible.
If it were not so...
...she would not want to haunt me
She does not haunt you, Nicholas.
Can you not see that? It is you punishing yourself.
I must leave in the morning.
Already I have been grossly negligent...
...of my other patients.
I beg of you- leave with me.
I can never leave.
I must accept whatever vengeance...
...Elizabeth chooses to inflict upon me.
Dona Medina? Dona Medina?
What is it, Mister Barnard?
May I speak with you?
- Certainly.
- I came to apologize.
Apologize?
But everything you said...
I know that my suspicions were justified...
...but not as I had expected.
I realize now that my sister's death...
...was an accident.
I do not blame your brother.
I feel only sympathy for him.
What I did was, I assure you, only because of Elizabeth.
I think I understand.
I am sorry that our meeting...
...should have taken place under such unhappy circumstances.
Had things been otherwise...
Perhaps we should meet again...
...in Barcelona.
I hope so.
Good night, Dona.
Good night.
- Doctor.
- Where are you going, sir?
- To apologize to don Medina.
- I wouldn't speak to him just now.
He is much overwrought.
In the morning, perhaps.
- You will be leaving then?
- Yes.
Will you accept the hospitality of my carriage?
Thank you, doctor. Good night.
Good night, mister Barnard.
Nicholas.
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
Nicholas.
Nicholas.
Elizabeth?
Where are you?
Elizabeth?
Where are you?
Nicholas?
Is my brother with you?
- No. Is he not in his room?
- No.
He must be with Dr. Leon then.
Nicholas.
I will check below.
You two search this floor and the one above.
All right
Nicholas.
Is that you?
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
Nicholas!
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
Nicholas.
Nicholas.
Nicholas!
I told you to wait.
I couldn't.
He is gone.
What about my brother?
He is supposed to leave in the morning..
...but now...
Why couldn't you wait one more day?
I've waited too long already.
Oh, my darling Nicholas...
...we've broken you at last.
Elizabeth, there is no time for this.
I've waited an eternity for this moment.
There has to be time.
And now, my dear Nicholas...
...I have you exactly as I want you...
...helpless.
Elizabeth.
Is it not ironical, my husband?
Your wife, an adulteress.
Your mother, an adulteress.
Your uncle, an adulterer.
Your closest friend, an adulterer.
Do you not find that amusing, dear Nicholas?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes!
Yes!
What's happening to him?
Happening?
What should be happening, lsabella? lsabella?
You, Bartholomew, my brother...
...how do you like my little workshop?
Dear God!
What ails you, brother, huh?
And you, my dear, why are you so pale?
Does this place disturb you?
I thought the two of you would enjoy...
...the novelty of it.
Come, let me show you about a bit.
Where are you going, lsabella?
Bartholomew!
Are you leaving me?
Don't you want to see my...?
I am going to torture you, lsabella.
I am going to make you suffer for your faithlessness to me.
Before this day is out...
...you will be begging me to kill you...
...to relieve you of the agony of hell..
...into which your husband is about to plunge you.
Harlot!
You will die in agony!
Die!
Now, Bartholomew, my brother...
Bartholomew!
Bartholomew!
Where are you?
You cannot hide from me, you know.
Don Medina?
Don Medina!
There you are, Bartholomew!
Ah, there you are, sir.
We've been searching all over for you.
And now for you Bartholomew, my beloved brother...
...while you are still alive...
...my ultimate device of torture.
Are you ready now, Bartholomew?
Bartholomew?
Now we are ready to begin, Bartholomew.
Do you know where you are, Bartholomew?
Don Medina, I am Francis Barnard.
I will tell you where you are.
You are about to enter hell, Bartholomew.
Hell!
The Netherworld.
The infernal region.
The abode of the damned.
The place of torment.
Pandemonium.
"Abbadon, "Tophet", "Gehenna".
"Naraka", the pit!
And the pendulum.
The razor edge of destiny.
That's the condition of man.
Bound on an island from which he can never hope to escape...
...surrounded by the waiting pit of hell.
Subject to the inexorable pendulum of fate...
...which must destroy him finally.
Nicholas?
Nicholas, are you in there?
Catherine, help me!
Nicholas?
Nicholas!
Maximillian! Maximillian!
We must break into the torture chamber. Quickly!.
Maximillian!
Don Medina- he thought that
I was...
It's over now.
Nicholas.
No one will ever enter this room again.
"...THE AGONY OF MY SOUL
FOUND VENT IN ONE LOUD, LONG,
AND FINAL SCREAM OF DESPAIR"...POE
- Miss Appleby?
- Yes.
My name's Robert.
I'm your father's chauffeur.
I'm afraid your father couldn't come.
Oh, I'll do that.
Do you know why my father didn't come to meet me?
- He's away, miss.
- He's not at the house?
- No, he went away four days ago.
- Where to?
I didn't even know he was going until your mother told me he left.
She's my stepmother.
I've never met her.
Oh, you haven't?
What's she like?
- Well, miss, it's hardly my position--
- Please.
- She's my employer's wife, miss.
- What's she like as a person?
I don't know her as a person.
You must know something about her.
You drive her.
Only occasionally. She usually drives herself or has Dr. Gerrard drive her.
- Who's he?
- He's your father's doctor.
- He's always up at the house.
- I didn't know my father was ill.
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't--
- What's wrong with him?
- I thought you'd have known that.
- No, I didn't know anything.
Oh, he's been ill for some time now.
That's what surprised me when--
- When what?
- Oh, it doesn't matter, miss.
You haven't been to France for a long time, I understand.
Ten years.
What's wrong with my father?
I don't know, miss. But whatever it was, he must be all right now.
- Otherwise, he wouldn't have gone.
- When will he be back?
Mrs. Appleby didn't say.
Hello, Penny. Welcome home.
- Jane?
- You sound surprised.
- Aren't I as you imagined?
- I'm sorry. I must sound rude.
Not a bit. Oh, take it through to the hall, Robert...
...and then come back for Miss Appleby.
- Was your journey terribly tiring?
- Not very.
It must've been a strain.
You haven't travelled much, have you?
- No, I haven't. But it was exciting.
- Good.
Careful, Robert.
The steps are quite a problem,
I'm afraid.
But we put ramps down wherever we can.
I didn't think you'd want to use the front door much.
We've put you in one of your father's rooms.
He uses it as a sitting room and a study. Fetch the cases, Robert.
It's very convenient, though.
It has its own bathroom.
UP We go.
It looks nice.
I made your father buy new curtains and a couple of extra chairs.
You've no idea how dark everything was.
Men always want to furnish their studies like Victorian mausoleums.
Jane, where is Father?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, darling.
It was unavoidable.
He simply had to go away on this business deal that he's working on.
I tried to stop him, but you know what your father is.
No, I'm afraid I don't.
I haven't seen him for 10 years.
I don't know if I'd recognise him.
Well, I've taken care of that.
Look, taken a month ago.
- Yes, I would've recognised him.
- Of course you would.
Oh, bring the cases in, Robert.
- Where do you want them, darling?
- On the bed, please.
- Would you like me to unpack for you?
- No, I can manage myself, thank you.
Is there anything more, madam?
No, that will be all, thank you.
I shan't need you again.
Well, I expect you want to be alone now.
Dinner's at 8. I'll come and fetch you.
Oh, and, Penny, if you want anything...
...this bell here rings down to the kitchen and up to my room as well.
Wonderful having you here.
Means so much to me.
Then when Mother died, there was only Maggie Frensham.
I know she was just my nurse, but she was much more than that really.
We were the same age, like sisters.
People said we even looked alike.
I think I loved her as much as I did my mother.
Is that why you didn't come home after your mother died?
This isn't my home.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound rude.
It's just that--
Well, I'd never met you, and I hadn't seen Father for 10 years...
...ever since Mother took me to Italy to live after they were divorced.
Well, Italy was my home.
I was brought up there.
As long as Maggie was with me,
I was happy.
And what actually happened?
She drowned.
Nobody knows how.
She was a good swimmer.
They said she must have gotten cramped.
I nearly killed myself, Jane. I didn't know what to do, who to turn to.
For two years since Mother died,
Maggie was all I had, everything...
...and then suddenly she just wasn't there anymore.
It seems like yesterday it all happened.
These things take time to sort themselves out, darling.
After all, it was only three weeks.
You can't have got over it yet.
No, of course not.
Then, when Father wrote asking me to come here to live, I--
But of course he did.
You're his daughter.
But this is your house, and I wasn't sure if you--
But it was I who suggested that he write to you.
Believe me, having you here makes me very happy.
- You're very kind.
- Nonsense.
Did you expect me to be like the wicked stepmother in the stories?
Honestly, I don't know what I expected.
It's a pity Father couldn't be here.
I was so cross when he said he had to go away.
He was ill.
The chauffeur, Robert, he said that Father was ill.
Well, I wonder why he said that.
There was nothing wrong with him, nothing at all.
He said something about a doctor. Doctor...?
Oh, yes, he meant Pierre Gerrard.
He's the doctor in the village.
He comes up and plays chess with your father.
- I must speak to Robert. He shouldn't--
- No, please.
Don't let him get into trouble on my account.
All right, if you want it that way.
Do you want some more coffee?
No, thank you.
Jane, would you excuse me if I went to bed now?
Of course. You must be dead.
Look at me, behaving like an old hen with one of her chicks.
Jane, thank you.
Thank you for everything.
I hope you can sleep, Penny.
The crickets make rather a noise.
- That's all right, I like crickets.
- Sometimes they're deafening.
Father?
Help! Help! Help!
Help!
- My darling, how do you feel?
- You're all right now.
Relax, young lady, there's nothing to get excited about.
Pierre. Pierre.
It's all right, Jane.
Now, Penny, you've had a fright.
But you must realise that everything is all right. You are safe.
What were you doing out there?
How did you fall in?
L-- I fell into the swimming pool.
Yes, Robert heard you.
He managed to get there in time.
- Father.
- Father's away. You know that.
He isn't. He's in the summerhouse.
I saw him.
- But he can't be, Penny.
- He was dead.
Penny, you had an accident, but you really must try--
- Who are you?
- Dr. Gerrard, darling.
He was dead. He was in the summerhouse, sitting in the chair.
- And I went in and I spoke to him.
- I'm going to give you a sedative.
In the morning, everything will be all right.
But don't you understand what I'm trying to say?
My father is dead.
His body's in the summerhouse.
Please, darling.
Please, you must--
Don't treat me as if I were a mental defective.
- What are you doing?
- I want to go to the summerhouse now.
Very well, if that makes you feel better.
- Where's my chair?
- It's at the bottom of the pool.
Robert will get it out in the morning.
Would you carry me, please?
- Go on, open it.
- But it's always kept locked.
- But it was open.
- It's always locked, Penny.
There was a candle.
There's no need for a candle here, Penny.
Take me back now.
We won't want you anymore tonight, thank you, Robert.
- Good night, doctor.
- Good night.
- Well, how are you feeling now?
- I'm sorry.
The imagination is a very funny thing.
It plays very unkind tricks at times.
It was probably the strain of the journey.
Now I'm going to give you a sedative.
- Sleep's the best cure for your trouble.
- If you say so.
You take this one now.
And in one hour, if you still can't sleep, this one. All right?
- Good night.
- Good night.
There.
- I'm sorry, Jane.
- Don't worry, darling.
Try and get some sleep.
Good night, Penny.
Good night.
Come in.
I'm bringing you some petit-déjeuner.
My name is Marie.
I don't think I saw you here last night.
I do not live here, mademoiselle.
I have a house in the village.
Would you please see what's happening to my chair?
- Your chair, mademoiselle?
- My wheelchair.
Good morning, darling.
How did you get from the bed?
I crawled.
You crawled, Penny?
What on earth for?
I couldn't sleep.
Did you take the other pill that Pierre gave you?
- No, I didn't.
- Why not?
I didn't want to.
Jane, when will my chair be ready?
I'll find out, shall I?
Garage.
Oh, good morning, madam.
- Yes, ma'am, in about 10 minutes.
- Thank you, Robert.
He's cleaning it up.
He'll bring it around when it's ready.
Thank you, Jane.
- Are you feeling better this morning?
- A little tired.
I was so worried.
- Your father told me--
- Told you what?
- Oh, nothing.
- Please, Jane.
Well, he told me how you were when you were a little girl.
Imaginative, fanciful, slightly...
- Neurotic?
- No, I didn't mean that.
I was, though.
I was afraid of everything.
Dark, wind, thunder, lightning.
- Most children are.
- They grow out of it.
Jane, what is that summerhouse used for?
Penny, darling, whatever you thought you saw last night...
...you must realise you imagined it.
Oh, I know that.
I'm just curious what it's used for.
Well, we keep old furniture there.
It's not used for anything nowadays.
Penny, darling, I've got to go out this morning...
...and I've asked Robert to show you around.
Won't you need him?
No, I can drive myself. We can't leave you alone your first day here.
- Oh, Jane, I'll be all right.
- No, nonsense.
Well, I--
I've got to go and get dressed now.
Jane?
Did Father say when he was coming back?
Not exactly, but I don't think it'll be today, darling.
It's lovely here. It's so peaceful.
Yeah, it's my favourite spot.
We swim from here in the summer.
I don't swim.
Because of your legs?
- Have you tried?
- No.
You'd probably find you could manage very well.
You're not one of those characters who can't talk about their--
- Their afflictions, I think they call it?
- I don't think so.
Meaning that other people don't talk about it in case it upsets you.
I guess you're right.
Why do people have to make a big thing out of it?
- How long have you been like that?
- Nine years.
- You were on a horse, weren't you?
- The horse was on me.
You know, I bet that's the first time you've joked about it.
I think it is.
Why do you hide behind those things?
- Hide?
- That's why you wear them, isn't it?
Like a person who sits with his back to the sun while talking to you.
- Is that what it looks like?
- It's true, isn't it?
I don't know.
I never really thought about it.
I feel more secure when I'm wearing these.
I can watch people's eyes and I know that they can't see mine.
- Well, why should you feel insecure?
- My legs, I suppose.
Being physically dependent on other people...
...doesn't build up your self-confidence.
You seem a pretty self-reliant person to me.
My behaviour last night wasn't very self-reliant.
Too much wine at dinner.
- Beginning to think you're right.
- Of course I am.
Alcoholic hallucination?
I didn't thank you for last night, did I, Bob?
- Well, what for?
- You pulled me out of the pool.
All part of the service.
How long have you worked for my father?
- Oh, two years.
- Do you like it?
It's the only way I get to drive expensive cars and live on the Riviera.
- Do you like working for my father?
- Oh, I don't see much of him.
Mrs. Appleby uses the car most of the time. He hardly ever goes out.
It's funny he didn't use you to drive him. When he went away.
That's not the only thing.
He used the small car.
- What's funny about it?
- He doesn't like the small car.
- Maybe the other wasn't there.
- It was.
They were both in the garage the night he left.
I wonder why he left at night.
Bob, would you take me back up now, please?
Back to the house?
Summerhouse.
- What are you looking for?
- Something, anything.
I thought you agreed it was just your imagination.
I did, but there must be something...
...that will tell me why my imagination acted the way it did.
Like a dead body?
Oh, I'm sorry, Penny.
Penny!
Come into the house.
I've got a surprise for you.
- What is it?
- Come and see.
I'll take it, Robert.
- What kind of a surprise?
- Wait and see.
It's for you.
- Hello?
- Penny, this is your father.
Penny, can you hear me?
What's the matter, darling?
- Penny?
- Yes.
Oh, I thought you'd gone.
Can you hear me all right?
Yes.
I'm sorry I wasn't there when you arrived.
Jane told you I was away on business?
Yes.
I'll be a couple more days yet.
Look after yourself and have fun.
All right. Thank you.
Let me speak to Jane, will you?
Yes? Hello.
- Is Penny all right?
- Yes, she's fine.
- Tell her I'll be back soon.
- Yes, I'll tell her.
- Do you miss me?
- Yes. See you soon.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
There. That makes you feel better about last night, doesn't it?
Oh, Penny, I-- I shouldn't go to the summerhouse again if I were you.
It was a horrible experience.
We don't want to repeat it, do we?
I can manage now, Jane.
Oh, darling, Dr. Gerrard is coming to lunch. You don't mind, do you?
No, of course not.
- May I come in?
- Yes.
It's about what I said just now in the summerhouse.
- Am I forgiven?
- Yes, of course.
- Well, what was the big surprise?
- My father.
He wanted to talk to me on the phone.
- No more worries, then?
- I suppose not.
Shall I take you for another walk this afternoon?
Dr. Gerrard's coming for lunch, and he may stay the afternoon.
- Oh, then I'd better get dressed.
- Why? You have to go out?
Well, if he's coming,
I've got to go pick him up.
- Doesn't he have a car?
- He has, but it's in dock.
He smashed it up last week.
He's a terrible driver.
- Did you bring him out here last night?
- I was to, but--
No, I didn't.
I took him home, though.
- How did he get out, then?
- I don't know.
I was only unconscious 20 minutes, wasn't I?
Yeah, about that. He just seemed to be here. I didn't think anything of it.
- Was he here to dinner?
- No.
Anyway, if he had been, you would have had to pick him up.
Yeah, that's funny.
I don't understand what's happening here.
One minute I think I was imagining everything...
...and the next
I'm just not sure anymore.
Even now that I've talked to my father,
I'm still not sure.
What, you mean it wasn't him?
I haven't talked to my father for nine years. It could've been anyone.
- Why?
- I don't know. I just don't know.
Now I'll tell you something.
You said last night a candle was burning in the summerhouse.
Everyone says, "Nonsense, there's an electric light there, why use a candle?"
What is it?
I scraped it off the floor just now when
Mrs. Appleby brought you indoors.
It's candle grease.
No, thank you.
- You haven't eaten anything, Penny.
- I'm not hungry.
You really should try to eat something.
You're a little run-down, you know.
Why do you say that?
A reasonably healthy person would never have experienced...
...what you did last night.
- You should be particularly careful.
- Why me?
Your father said that when you were a child, you were over-imaginative...
...and inclined to be frightened of your own shadow.
Then your accident, and all those weeks in hospital...
...it's hardly surprising that your mind is a little confused, is it?
You must be very careful. Shocks such as the one you had last night...
...whether the cause is real or imaginary...
...can deal the mind a very serious blow.
A blow which could affect it permanently.
You mean I could go mad?
I didn't mean to imply anything as drastic as that.
What did you mean to imply?
Well, it's just that if the imagination starts to wander...
...one has to try and drag it back to reality before--
Before it becomes permanent, you said, Dr. Gerrard.
- Pierre meant--
- I know what he meant.
He meant I'd better watch myself or I'll go insane...
...and have to be locked up.
Bob?
- Miss Penny.
- Would you get that key down for me?
I can't. Mrs. Appleby's got it.
I thought it was kept up on the ledge.
It was, but she asked for it before lunch.
- Why?
- I'm sorry, I don't know.
That candle grease you were telling me about--
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
It doesn't tell anything.
It helps prove what I was saying.
It proves a candle's been burned in there. It could be months ago.
- The place is never used.
- I saw it last night.
Yes, miss. So you said.
You don't believe me either, do you?
I believe you think you saw something.
First Dr. Gerrard and Jane.
And now you.
Now, listen. Believe me, I'd like to help, but can't see what I can do.
Robert? I'm ready, Robert.
Will you bring the car around to the front?
Sure you don't want to come, darling?
The drive will do you good.
Put colour in your cheeks.
No, thank you.
Can I bring you anything from Cannes?
No.
All right.
I'll be back just after dark.
Come in.
If there is nothing else, mademoiselle,
I should like to go now.
- Oh, is Mrs. Appleby back yet?
- No.
Robert told me she had shopping to do in Cannes.
They will not be back until half an hour more, I think.
All right. Thank you.
Good night, Marie.
Bob?
Bob? Is that you?
Bob?
Father?
Bring the things in here, Robert.
Hello, darling. Why didn't you tell me you wanted to use the sitting room?
Marie could have lit the fire.
Jane, who uses the piano?
Your father. Nobody else in the house can play.
He keeps it locked.
He doesn't like people tinkling with it, says it ruins the tone.
- What kind of car is the small car?
- What do you mean, darling?
The small one.
The one Father went away in.
It's a white Simca.
He's come back.
It's in the garage.
Miss Penny, I just--
That'll be all, thank you, Robert.
You can go.
I saw the car. It was in the garage.
We've just came from the garage.
There was no car there.
But I saw it. I was there and I saw it.
- But you couldn't have. Otherwise--
- Leave me alone.
Penny.
Bob?
- There wasn't any car.
- There was a small white sports car.
How did I know my father had that car if I didn't see it?
You didn't. I just told you in the living room.
But I saw it, I tell you.
It was there. I heard it arrive.
And someone started playing the piano.
- The piano is locked.
- I know, and there was no one there.
But someone was playing that piano.
I know it doesn't make any sense but--
Garage.
Yes, madam, she's here.
Yes, I'll tell her.
Mrs. Appleby asked me to tell you that supper will be in half an hour.
Look, try not to worry too much.
There's bound to be a reasonable explanation for all this.
We'll try and work something out together, shall we?
Thank you. Good night, Bob.
Good night, Miss Penny.
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob! He was there.
- Penny, what is it?
- In my room.
What is it?
What is all the noise?
Miss Penny. She came out screaming about something in her room.
- Poor child. Where is she now?
- I'm here.
What happened, darling?
What frightened you?
I'm sorry. I thought I saw something.
But what? What did you see?
I seem to have caused a lot of fuss about nothing.
- My imagination again.
- You frightened me to death.
- Are you sure you're all right now?
- It won't happen again.
I hope not, because your poor head won't stand many more shocks.
Would you like me to bring your dinner in here? Would you like that?
- I'll be all right now.
- Good.
Oh, Penny, I hope you don't mind,
I've asked Dr. Gerrard to dinner.
Why?
Well, I could put him off if you'd rather.
Don't bother because of me.
That'll be all, thank you, Robert.
Well, good night, ma'am.
Miss Penny.
- Good night. I'm sorry if I--
- Don't mention it.
- Penny, you're sure you're all right?
- Please, I feel bad enough as it is.
- Don't make it any worse.
- No, of course not.
Well, I'll see you at dinner in about 20 minutes.
Thank you.
Bob.
I was hoping you'd come back.
You weren't imagining things, were you?
No.
Tell me what you saw.
My father.
He was sitting there, in that chair.
And he was dead.
And...
...he moved his head.
It was horrible.
You were outside the room?
I went to the summerhouse to see alight.
The same light that was there last night.
- That was very brave of you.
- I had to know what it was.
And when I was there,
I saw a light go off in here...
...so I came rushing back.
And, Bob, he was sitting there waiting.
What is it?
It's wet. Soaking wet.
What does it mean, Bob?
Your father's a very rich man, isn't he?
- Yes.
- Any idea what's in his will?
- How do you mean?
- If he dies, who gets the money?
- I do.
- All of it? What about Mrs. Appleby?
There's a trust fund.
She gets the interest.
Are you sure?
Could the will have been changed?
You haven't seen your father for a long time.
It couldn't have been.
The money was my grandfather's...
...and he didn't approve of second marriages.
Are there any conditions?
Well, if I'm dead or incapable,
Jane gets the money.
Incapable?
You know, unable to handle the estates...
...legally incompetent, insane--
They want you out of the way before it's discovered that your father's dead.
- That way you won't collect the money.
- Jane will.
Bob, that means that they killed my father.
They may have, but not likely.
If they had, they'd have no qualms about killing you too.
No, the trouble they're going to to drive you insane...
...makes it look as though your father's had an accident, perhaps...
...and all they're doing is keeping quiet about it.
Then when they can get you out of the way, they'll rig the accident...
-...so it looks as if it's just happened.
- What can we do?
We're only guessing. We'd better look around for some sort of evidence.
But what?
It's not very pleasant, I know, but somewhere here is your father's body.
We've got to find it.
Bob, I'm frightened.
I'll look around after your stepmother's gone to bed.
I wanna go with you.
All right.
Look, draw your curtains when I go.
When she's gone to bed, open them up again. I'll watch for the light.
Bob?
Thank you.
- Pierre?
- Thank you.
Penny?
- Penny--
- What do you want?
- Pierre only wants to help you, darling.
- Please, Jane.
If it's about my mental health,
I'd rather not hear it.
It's about your legs.
When was the last time that you saw a specialist?
- Why?
- Tell me, please.
Three years ago.
Well, that's why I want you to see another one now, in Zurich.
I have seen specialists all over the world...
-...and they all said the same thing.
- Yes, I know.
But the last time was three years ago.
Penny, do you know what is meant by hysterical paralysis?
Well, it happens when, because of a fright or an accident...
...a person can lose the use of a muscle or a limb.
There is no tissue pathology to account for this.
There are no physical symptoms to account for this...
...but the fact is inescapable.
The person is completely unable to--
Well, for example, to walk.
The reasons for this are mental.
They're not physical.
There's no physical reason why this person should not get straight up...
...out of her chair and walk with the rest of us.
It's only this self-created mental block that prevents her.
You're trying to tell me that I'm not a cripple?
- That it's all in my mind?
- I'm saying that could be the case.
Was the horse that fell on me in my mind too? Did I imagine that?
No. No, that was the basic cause,
I admit.
But since then the physical damage could have been repaired.
It is only the mental side that refuses to accept this.
That is why I'm, well, seriously worried about your mental state.
After all, with all this confusion going on...
...you can hardly expect your mind to behave rationally.
Dr. Gerrard, I am a cripple.
My back was broken in two places.
If you want the technical diagnosis...
...I sustained a multiple fracture of the first lumbar vertebra...
...and a simple fracture between the fifth and sixth cervical.
I can show you the x-rays if you'd like.
But I didn't imagine it and I'm not imagining it now.
Do you think that I like being tied to this chair...
...dependent on anyone who can spare me a moment?
Do you think that I like not being able to--?
To dance and swim and ride...
...or just walk like anyone else?
I don't like it. I hate it.
I loathe and hate and despise it.
You say that my mind is affecting my legs. You're wrong.
It's my legs that are affecting my mind.
I'd rather not talk about it anymore.
- I think what Pierre meant, Penny--
- I said no more, Jane. I mean it.
- Is she in bed?
- She went up about 20 minutes ago...
...but I thought it'd be better to wait a little longer.
- We've got the place to ourselves.
- Where are we going to look?
I've been thinking since we talked.
The weather's not very cold.
The body..
Well, I mean, it's not going to keep.
- There's only one place it could be.
- Where?
Deep freeze.
A week ago, Mrs. Appleby asked me to fit a new lock on it.
Shall we go?
Okay?
Yes.
What will we do now?
- Keep looking.
- Where?
I don't know.
We can't do any more tonight.
I better take you back to your room.
- What about the lock?
- I'll fix it later.
I don't see why we just can't go and tell them what we know.
But that's it, Penny.
We don't know anything.
We can't just march in and say your father's met with a fatal accident...
...and your stepmother and
Dr. Gerrard are trying to conceal it.
- Why not?
- Because without proof...
...they wouldn't believe us.
No, we've got to find the body.
But where?
You yourself said that a body won't--
Won't keep. Where could it be?
Somewhere close to the house.
It has to be.
I'm not much help to you there.
I can't even get up the stairs.
It's how it should be. I don't want you wandering. Anything might happen.
Leave it to me. I'll think of something.
I'll get you back to the house for lunch.
Why are you doing all this for me,
Bob?
I don't like to see anybody get the sharp end of the stick.
I liked your father. I don't like your stepmother or that Gerrard character.
Because you're pretty.
It's not sympathy?
Sure, there's sympathy there.
But not for the reasons you think.
You're a nice person who's in trouble.
I sympathize with you for that.
Not because of these?
Like I told you before, it's hard luck.
There's plenty of people worse off than you are.
There's another reason too.
Shall I tell you what it is?
I didn't mean to do that until all this was over.
I'm glad you did.
Hey, if I keep you out any longer,
I shall be looking for a new job.
Penny, you're not getting too friendly with Robert, are you?
Too friendly?
Well, I've been watching you when you're together, and you seem...
Cheerful is the word, Jane.
We want you to be happy, darling, don't misunderstand. But not Robert.
How would you like me to give a party and ask the local people?
- Like Dr. Gerrard?
- Don't you like him?
- Not especially.
- Well, you must talk to your father.
Because he's his friend, not mine.
No, I was thinking of Monsieur Gaston.
He lives on the other side of the bay.
He has two sons about your age.
Then there's John Blakeman--
Please, Jane, thank you, but I'd rather not.
All right, Penny.
I know it can't be much fun for you at the moment, darling.
But in the summer, it's lovely here.
We might get the pool cleaned out, and then perhaps you could swim.
Madame Latour, madame.
My dressmaker. I should have seen her in Cannes this morning.
I won't be long.
- What's the matter, Penny?
- Matter? Nothing.
You looked strange for a moment.
I've got to go out this afternoon.
I won't be back till 10 tonight.
- Will you be all right?
- I'd rather not be alone.
No, of course not.
I'll ask Marie if she can stay.
Don't bother. If I know that Robert's in his room, I won't be worried.
I can drive myself.
Are you sure you want to?
Oh, it's just the cold.
Let's get it over with.
Well, here we go.
Anything?
No, it's black as pitch down there.
Maybe it would be better if--
He's there, isn't he?
What shall we do?
- Go to the police.
- Now?
Well, there's no point in waiting.
We've found what we were looking for.
- What about--?
- We must leave him there.
We'll fetch the police back and show them.
I'll come with you.
Okay. I'll go and get dressed, and meet you around the front.
Can you manage?
Five minutes.
- You don't want your chair, do you?
- No, I suppose not.
What if they find the chair?
It doesn't really matter, does it? Once we get back, nothing matters anymore.
How long will it take to get there?
It's no good going to the village police station. The old chap there's useless.
We'll go straight through to Cannes.
It'll only take us half an hour.
- It will all be over soon, Penny.
- I was thinking about my father.
I never knew him really, not as a daughter, but I know that he was kind.
Even after Mother divorced him, he was always doing things for her.
Little things, like--
He always remembered my birthday.
How could this have happened, Bob?
How?
- Greed.
- She was his wife.
She must have loved him once.
Can it die so completely?
Not die, no. But it can be killed by--
By another love. By somebody else.
Dr. Gerrard.
I suppose so.
What's that?
- It's your stepmother.
- Don't stop. I'm frightened.
She'll recognise the car. I'll have to stop. You sit tight. I'll speak to her.
Will she be dead?
She's a cripple, isn't she?
She's dead.
It worked, Bob. It worked.
The accident will be discovered.
There will be a coroner's inquest.
- But it will be all right?
- Yes, it'll be all right.
Turn it off, Bob, please.
I rather like it.
It makes a good requiem.
Please, Bob.
To us.
What's the matter?
Having to kill her.
But we agreed we'd have to if it didn't work the other way.
If only we could have done it without killing.
I thought when her father had the accident...
...everything would be all right.
It seemed that things...
Well, what is it, Bob?
Why are you smiling?
You never believed your husband had an accident, did you?
- Did you?
- Bob, don't.
- Did you?
- Don't, Bob. Don't.
The old man could swim like a fish, and you know it.
Do you know what I did?
I dragged him under and I held him there.
- Bob, don't.
- I watched his stupid face...
-...while he tried to hold his breath.
- Please, don't.
Then there were a lot of bubbles.
And he stopped struggling.
Your telephone call reached me this morning...
...at the same time as this report.
A break in the cliff fence.
An automobile upside down in 30 feet of water.
It is likely that the two things are the same. I am sorry.
Your stepdaughter had not been with you long, I understand.
Four days.
- And Monsieur Appleby?
- He arrived home last night.
They went for a drive together...
...because they wanted to get to know one another again.
They hadn't seen each other for 10 years. I was an outsider, really.
It must have been difficult for you.
It was, a bit. But it would have been all right. I know it would. And now this.
You have my deepest sympathies,
Mrs. Appleby.
You will be at the house if we want you?
- Want me?
- The bodies will have to be identified.
- Oh, do I have to?
- I'm afraid so. It's the law.
Your husband's solicitor has been informed.
He will be coming from London this morning.
He will go straight to the house.
No doubt there will be a number of things to attend to.
Your husband was rich, wasn't he?
- I suppose so.
- And now everything comes to you.
I believe so.
It would have gone to Penny.
Quite so.
You'll ask the solicitor to contact me?
Yes, I will. Thank you, inspector.
You've been very kind.
I will arrange for a car to take you home.
Mrs. Appleby has her own car.
I know. But I'd like you to accompany me to the scene of the accident.
We'll need you to identify the automobile.
- It's all right, Robert.
- Well, if you say so, ma'am.
- Goodbye, inspector.
- Good day, Mrs. Appleby.
- I'll wait for you outside, inspector.
- Thank you.
You can identify the automobile from here?
Well, hardly, inspector.
Of course not.
The frogman will attempt to ascertain...
...the colour, the make and the number of the car.
Then we will know.
I shall go down to talk with the frogman.
Oh, there's plenty of time.
You will wait here, please.
You have my deepest sympathy,
Mrs. Appleby.
- Such a tragedy.
- Thank you, Mr. Spratt.
I've tried to keep the papers down to a minimum.
You must understand that in such cases...
...there is an amount of legal work which must be taken care of.
- Yes, of course.
- Before anything becomes official...
...we must wait for the verdict of the coroner.
But if in the meantime there's anything that you require, please let me know.
Your husband's will is most clear and explicit.
Everything he has is to go to you...
...with no attachments or codicil whatsoever.
Now if you'll please just sign...
...on the papers where I have left a cross in pencil.
The will allows you to draw money from the estate pending settlement.
There's just one thing, Mr. Spratt.
I understand in a case of common accident when both parties die...
...there's sometimes a dispute as to who legally was the first to die.
That's quite so. But I fail to see that it has any bearing on the matter in hand.
- Well, this was a common accident.
- What was?
Both my husband and my stepdaughter were in the car together.
Your stepdaughter, Miss Penelope?
Oh, didn't they tell you?
I thought the police--
I'm sorry, Mrs. Appleby.
I just don't understand you.
Well, both my husband and Penny were in the car. They--
They were killed together.
No, that's quite impossible.
I don't know why you say that,
Mr. Spratt. It's a fact.
- They went for a drive and--
- Mrs. Appleby, surely you must know.
Your stepdaughter,
Miss Penelope Appleby...
...committed suicide three weeks ago in Switzerland.
Are you all right, Mrs. Appleby?
Can I get you anything?
- Mrs. Appleby?
- I'm sorry.
Obviously your husband didn't tell you.
His daughter went for a holiday with her companion, a Miss Frensham.
She drowned herself, apparently.
She was always of a delicate mental state.
It was due to her paralysis,
I understand.
Really, you must allow me to get you some brandy.
Come down here a moment, please.
My apologies for asking you to come down all this way.
It was easier than for me to go up.
We'd only have to come down again immediately.
Climbing I do not find agreeable.
- Is it the car?
- It is a Rolls-Royce, silver and black...
...with the number 278EMO6.
- Is it the car?
- Yeah, that's it.
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.
Strange.
There's only one person inside.
- A man.
- The girl? The daughter?
Of her, I'm afraid, there's no sign.
I shall have to leave you now,
Mrs. Appleby.
I must report to the local police for news of the recovery.
Yes, of course.
Are you quite sure you're all right?
- I'm all right, thank you.
- I shall show myself out.
Is your friend quite safe out there?
Friend?
The young lad)'-
Good day, Mrs. Appleby.
Good morning, Jane.
Why so silent?
- Who are you?
- Maggie Frensham.
Frensham? The companion.
That's right. Penny's friend.
But I don't understand.
I spent three years watching
Penny die, Mrs. Appleby.
Little by little. When her mother died, she was all alone.
For a girl like Penny, that was unbearable.
Finally I couldn't stand it any longer, so I wrote to her father.
- You wrote to him here?
- Yes.
He answered. He said that she couldn't come here then...
...because something strange was happening.
But he didn't say anything to me.
He'd hardly have told you,
Mrs. Appleby.
It was you that he was disturbed about.
Penny finally stopped struggling against life.
She slipped out of the cabin one night and drowned herself.
Two weeks later,
I opened a letter that arrived for her.
"Please come home, Penny.
I have always wanted you here.
Signed, Father."
Penny was dead, Mrs. Appleby.
And her father knew it.
But how did he know?
I told him myself. I spoke to him on the phone the night that Penny died.
You spoke to him here?
Yes. That's when he told me about his friend.
What friend? Who?
Can't you guess, Mrs. Appleby?
- Pierre.
- That's right. Dr. Gerrard.
Then when this letter arrived with your husband's signature on it...
...I knew something must be wrong because he knew Penny was dead.
So I contacted Dr. Gerrard, and he and I decided what to do.
- You're not crippled.
- No.
I'm not.
That's why I'm still here.
I opened the car door last night and jumped out.
It was Robert. He told me to--
- What are you doing to do?
- Need you ask that, Mrs. Appleby?
Is it money?
No, no, I don't want money.
I have more than enough.
Penny and I were very close.
She left me well provided for.
- Are you Robert, the chauffeur?
- Yes, sir.
I'm Spratt, Mr. Appleby's solicitor.
I've left Mrs. Appleby.
She's not feeling well.
Keep an eye on her. There doesn't seem to be anyone except the girl.
- The girl?
- The cripple in the wheelchair.
I'll be at the Grand Hotel if anyone wants me.
Please, isn't there anything--?
There's nothing, Mrs. Appleby.
On, Bob.
Bob!
Monsieur Robert, will you come with me, please?
Come away, Maggie.
There's nothing more for you here.
- Morning, Johann.
- Good morning.
Morning.
What is it? What is it, boy?
Dear God, when shall we be free?
When shall we be free of his evil?
A year has passed since Dracula...
perpetrator of these obscene evils, was destroyed...
and I, Ernst Muller...
Monsignor of the Holy Catholic Church in the province of Keinenberg...
decided it was time I paid a visit to the little village in the valley...
to see that all was well.
Giddap.
Boy.
Boy, come here. You need not fear me.
Where is the Reverend Father?
Can you understand me?
Where is your priest?
Why is he not here saying Mass?
Poor boy.
Then show me where he is.
I have just inspected your church.
But for this boy here, it was empty.
Why was it empty?
Why were you not there saying Mass?
I was there, Monsignor.
I have said Mass.
You have said Mass already into an empty church?
- Yes.
- Then why was the church empty?
Well?
I think you know, Monsignor.
No, I do not know.
I know that your church was once vilely desecrated.
But the perpetrator of that ghastly deed... was destroyed some 12 months ago.
Is that not so?
Was he not sent to his doom in the waters of your mountains?
And was he not, therefore, destroyed forever?
Is that not so?
Then why were you not there in church this morning?
It's the shadow, sir.
- Shadow?
- The shadow of his castle, sir.
It touches the church.
In the evenings it touches it.
Whose castle?
Count Dracula? Is that who you mean?
Why do you not speak his name?
He cannot harm you anymore.
He is destroyed, is he not?
And he is dead.
Is he dead or not?
- Yes, he is dead.
- Well, then.
But the evil is still there.
We can feel it in the shadow, even in the church.
There is no evil in a house of God!
Landlord...
I wish to talk to my priest in private.
Now then, perhaps you'd better tell me all about it.
It's as they say, Monsignor.
The castle is still evil.
You can feel it.
You can't imagine what it's like.
I am not unacquainted with evil.
The question is, what are we going to do about it?
I don't know.
Has anybody been up there since that time?
- To the castle?
- Yes.
- Have you been?
- No. Never.
Then you should have gone to prove there is nothing to fear.
Me?
I will come with you.
- When?
- Tomorrow, first light.
You will be ready.
Otherwise I shall have to go alone.
That would not be easy for me.
You know the mountains well. I do not.
I will go with you.
Thank you, Father.
I never doubted you.
Dawn will be about 6:00 tomorrow.
We will meet at 5:30.
Please do not be late.
All ready, Father?
Let us pray together.
Dear God.
Come.
No, I can't.
You must follow me.
- There is nothing to fear.
- There is.
There is.
It will soon be dark.
- I'm not coming.
- I tell you, there is nothing to fear.
- Have courage.
- Please.
Please.
Very well.
You need not come with me.
But you must wait here until I return, you understand?
Yes.
You'll be quite safe here.
When I return, we will go down again together.
I understand.
- Wish me well then.
- I do.
I do.
And may God protect you.
Father!
Father!
Open up!
A brandy. Give him a brandy.
Bar the door.
It's done.
The evil is destroyed forever.
- You went there to the castle?
- Yes.
I read the service of exorcism... and sealed the door with a cross.
His spirit will never leave there to trouble you again.
It's a miracle.
You have the thanks of everyone here.
- Has your priest not returned yet?
- The priest?
I had to leave him.
He came down before me.
Yes. The priest was here, Monsignor.
Thank God. Where is he now?
He went off by himself.
He said he wished to be alone.
- I don't know where he's gone.
- I see.
I understand how he must feel.
When he returns, please tell him what I have done... and that I wish him Godspeed.
- Then you're leaving now, sir?
- Yes.
There's nothing more to be done here, and I must go home to Keinenberg.
Who has done this thing?
Who has done this thing?
Monsignor.
It was the Monsignor.
Anna.
Ernst. You're back. That's good.
I wasn't expecting you.
You look tired.
Yes, Anna, I am tired.
- I traveled through the night.
- Not only tired, but worried.
- Did something happen?
- Yes.
Can you tell me about it?
Not just now, Anna. Later, perhaps.
Later will be best.
Now you sit there and rest a moment.
I'll fetch your slippers.
These long journeys are too much for you at your age.
You should speak to your superiors.
If you don't, I shall.
There are plenty of younger men who could do your work.
Young men whom you have trained.
You should be allowed to stay here in Keinenberg with us.
There are six churches here. Or near here.
Enough for you to keep your eye on... without all this journeying around the countryside.
Let me take your boots off.
I'll put these slippers on.
- You're as good as a wife to me, Anna.
- Not quite, Ernst.
I shouldn't joke about such things to you,
I know.
There. Off you go and rest.
- Plenty of time for joking tonight.
- Tonight?
Yes. We're having a little dinner party.
It's Maria's birthday.
Did you not remember?
Of course.
- How is she, Anna?
- Maria?
She's as happy as ever.
Why should she not be?
A fine education, a beautiful home.
You're very good to her, you know, Ernst.
I owe it to my brother.
Yes.
Anyone can give charity.
You give us more than that.
You give us your love.
Now off you go and rest.
I'll wake you in plenty of time for the party.
Try not to worry so.
I'm sure whatever it was that was wrong, you will have put it to right.
God knows I hope so, Anna.
- You rested? You look much better.
- I feel much better.
- Who is our guest to be?
- Maria has invited a friend.
A young man, Ernst.
And Ernst... be gentle with him.
He's very precious to her.
He works in the Cafe Johann in the bakery.
That's just to keep him while he studies.
He's a clever boy, Ernst.
He's going to be a doctor, or professor, or something.
Good.
Making ourselves pretty, are we?
You're going to meet her mama for the first time tonight, aren't you?
Now, you take a good look at her mama, my boy... because that's exactly what your girl's going to look like after you've married her.
- That is, if her mama lets you marry her.
- And why shouldn't she?
Why shouldn't she?
Why should she? What are you?
Young, hard-working, good-looking, abstemious.
You're a second-class pastry cook.
And if you work hard... you may in time become a first-class pastry cook.
And who will want to marry you then?
Up every morning before dawn.
- That's not for me, Max.
- No?
- No. I'm ambitious.
- I see.
Those books of yours.
Where are they going to get you?
Away from here for a start.
- So, you don't like it here?
- I didn't say that, Max.
I do like it here.
It keeps me fit.
And I have time off to study.
- And the food's good?
- And the food's good.
I'm grateful. Really, I am.
Funny way to show it.
What I don't understand is what you hope to get out of these books of yours.
What life's about, something of the truth.
The truth. What do you want with that?
Look, if you want to be a success in life, forget the truth.
I can't just forget it.
Then stay a pastry cook.
That way it doesn't matter.
Do you want any money?
Not tonight, Max.
Mind your manners.
And don't go telling her mother the truth about the way she looks... and what her cooking tastes like.
That truth she can do without.
Come on, out of the way, all of you.
Move along.
Your dumplings are boiling over, Zena.
And your fly's undone, but I didn't want to mention it.
Teach you to be cheeky.
Hello. You're looking pretty.
Yes, that's what I thought.
Maria here?
Always Maria.
What about giving me a chance?
Zena, you've got more boyfriends than you can remember.
I've always got room for one more.
Come on, Paul. Come on, join in.
Very good, Paul.
Here, take this glass. What now?
What indeed.
It's my best suit.
- Zena, I'm going out tonight.
- Not with me, you're not.
I'm meeting Maria's mother.
I want to make a good impression.
I don't want to go through soaked through smelling of beer.
Now please!
Paul!
Oh, God.
Maria, I'm afraid your boyfriend's a bit wet about the ears.
Hello, Maria.
Look, I'm sorry about this, but I...
Look at you, and tonight of all nights.
- Don't worry. He'll dry out in the night air.
- Come on, you'll have to come as you are.
Mother hates me to be late, especially tonight.
Yes, Paul, don't be late for mama!
- Am I forgiven?
- Yes, I suppose so.
- But we must hurry.
- Does it still smell?
- Yes, a bit.
- Do you think your mother will notice?
She'll notice all right, but she won't say anything.
- Good job your uncle isn't home yet.
- Paul.
Come on, I'll race you home.
Maybe it will dry you out.
Mother.
Mother, this is....
Happy birthday, Maria.
That's a fine way to greet your uncle.
Uncle Ernst, it's lovely to see you.
- I just didn't expect you, that's all.
- So I gathered.
Paul, I'm terribly sorry.
Mother, this is Paul.
I've told you all about him, haven't I?
Yes, you have, frequently.
- How are you, Paul?
- Frau Muller.
And this is my Uncle Ernst.
So you're on your best behavior.
Sir.
Just the way to make the poor boy feel at his ease.
Pay no attention to her, Paul.
Make yourself at home.
- Ernst, give Paul a drink.
- Certainly. A glass of wine?
Paul doesn't drink. Do you, Paul?
No, sir. That is, only beer.
I haven't any beer, I'm afraid.
That's all right. I had one before I left.
Only one?
You noticed.
It was rather noticeable.
It was the students at the Cafe Johann.
They played a trick on Paul and spilled beer all over him.
It was a sort of game, you see... where the glass was on the end of a stick... and I went around with another glass of beer.
I had to drink, and there was beer in the....
- Would you accept these, Frau Muller?
- Thank you.
Anna, when I'm on my travels, there's only one thing I dream about:
Your cooking.
Your mind should be on higher things, Ernst.
- Give Paul a cigar.
- Would you like a cigar, Paul?
No, thank you, sir. To be truthful, they make me feel a little sick.
You know, I like that in a man, Paul.
Not enough people say what they really mean these days.
Many people speak only to impress... not stopping to think if what they're saying is really true.
Happens in the church, too, you know.
I hear it only too often on my rounds.
- There are six churches here, you know.
- Yes, sir.
Which one do you attend?
Paul doesn't come from Keinenberg, Uncle.
- This isn't his home.
- I know...
He works very hard in the bakery.
He doesn't have much time.
- But on Sundays?
- I don't go to church, sir.
- You don't go to church?
- No, sir.
- You're not a Protestant, are you?
- No, sir.
Thank Heaven for that.
I'm an atheist, sir.
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm an atheist, sir.
You mean you deny the existence of God?
I don't deny it. I just don't believe it.
It's my own opinion, sir.
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes, sir.
And you come here to my house, speaking this blasphemy?
You asked for my beliefs, sir, and I've given them.
It was an honest answer, sir.
You said you liked people to be honest.
Don't be impertinent.
Would you like me to leave, Frau Muller?
Yes, I think it would be best.
I'm sorry, Frau Muller.
Thank you very much for your hospitality.
Maria.
Good night, sir.
- Paul...
- Maria, you will stay here.
Oh, Mama.
- Night-night, Zena.
- Good night. Go on, go home.
Come on, girl. Let's go and have a party.
- Give me a schnapps, Zena.
- Back so soon?
Give me a schnapps. A large one.
- You don't drink schnapps.
- Well, I'm starting now.
No need to ask you if something went wrong.
No, it did. Her uncle turned up.
And you had a row with him.
He asked my opinion.
And you gave it.
- I only told him the truth.
- When will you learn?
- How can people enjoy that?
- They don't. They just like the effect.
- I don't feel any effect.
- You will.
I'll have another one while I'm waiting.
Go to bed.
You coming with me?
You want to be careful what you're saying.
What have you done with my legs?
Come on.
Up to your room before Max gets back.
- Zena.
- Come on.
- What are you doing, Zena?
- I'm undoing your jacket.
You can put me down now, Zena.
Hello, Zena.
What are you doing in my bed?
- You may well ask.
- Yes.
Well, I am asking.
Does she kiss you like that?
I bet she doesn't.
Might as well make you comfortable.
- Zena.
- Hello.
What's going on?
- Nothing.
- What happened?
Three large schnapps.
That's what happened. He's not used to it.
You better help me get him into bed.
Zena, don't....
Well, he's your boyfriend.
You tuck him up.
Maria.
What are you doing in my bedroom?
I feel sick.
- I think I'll have a glass of water.
- I'll get it.
That's better. Have some. It's delicious.
- I can't think why I drink anything else.
- Nor can I.
- I spoiled everything at dinner, didn't I?
- I'm afraid so, Paul.
It's because I always have to go and tell the truth.
Why can't I make a lot of polite conversation... like everybody else?
What do I have to take things so seriously for?
Because you're you, I suppose.
Fat lot of good it does me.
That's why I love you, Paul.
Do you love me, Maria?
In spite of everything?
Do you still love me?
Yes.
I think you must... otherwise you wouldn't be here like this... with me.
Zena, you still here?
- Is Paul back yet?
- He's upstairs studying.
- He's a good boy. He'll go far.
- Not too far, I hope.
Well, I.... What are you doing here?
I've locked up and you've got a long way to go.
Do you want to stay the night or something?
No, thanks.
I've had enough trouble with all those students, without you as well.
Besides, a walk's good for my figure.
- Off you go, straight home.
- Good night.
Don't come with me.
- Are you sure?
- I'm quite sure.
- Shall I see you tonight?
- I'll try.
Goodbye.
You gave me a shock.
What are you doing here?
I didn't go home last night.
You've been here all night? But why?
I just didn't feel like going home.
Do you want some coffee?
- Hey, what's the matter...
- I'm all right!
Now do you want some coffee?
Yes, please.
Serve the priest, will you, Zena?
You want something, Father?
Breakfast, hot rolls, chocolate?
I wondered if perhaps there was a room... which I could rent for a few days?
- Sorry.
- We do have a room.
The one next to Paul is empty.
If I could have it.
It's a very small room, Father.
You couldn't swing a cat in it... and it's right at the top of the house.
I don't care what it's like or where it is.
If you'd be so kind.
You can have it for a few days.
Paul, show him up, will you?
Do you have any baggage, Father?
- Just this.
- I'll take it.
You're very kind.
Zena, what's come over you?
I don't want a priest here.
Is this your first visit to Keinenberg, Father?
Yes.
I'm here on church business.
Do you know the Monsignor by any chance?
We have met. I know his niece better.
His niece?
Paul, get me some more glasses. Please?
- Paul!
- Coming.
Would you take over for me for a minute?
I don't feel very well.
I said you didn't look well.
- Just for a while.
- Yes, of course.
What's the matter? What have I done?
- There is a girl.
- A girl? What girl?
- The niece of the Monsignor.
- Maria?
Bring her to me.
What do you want her for? You've got me.
Bring her to me!
Hey, now, Paul.
Come on, that's not enough.
Paul.
Hello. You feeling better?
Yes, I'm fine now.
You can go back to your studies.
Thanks. You sure you feel all right?
Yes. Back to your dreary old books.
Paul, is Maria coming in tonight?
- I hope so, if she can get away.
- I'll call you when she comes.
Thanks, Zena. You're a good sort.
Some more beer, Zena. Hurry up.
I'm dying of thirst.
I'll give you a hand, Zena.
- Zena, hurry up.
- Come back, Zena.
We'll never get a drink now.
- Hello, Zena.
- Hello, Maria.
- Where's Paul?
- He's downstairs in the bakery.
Thank you.
- Hello, Maria.
- Hello, Max.
Lovely girl, that.
Paul.
Paul, come on.
No!
- What have you done with Maria?
- Maria?
She was looking for you.
Stop messing about.
You know she's not here.
Where is she, Paul?
- Who?
- Maria.
What have you done with her, Paul?
- Is she really here?
- She went down there to find you.
Maria.
- Where's Maria, Paul?
- He can't find her.
She's not down there, Max.
You'd better go and try upstairs, but I'm sure she went down to the bakery.
Sneaked her up to his room.
That's what he's done.
Maria.
Are you hurt? What happened?
- Don't leave me!
- I won't.
But how did you get here like this?
I don't know.
I came to look for you, and then I....
It's all right, darling.
- You have failed me.
- But I....
- You must be punished.
- Forgive me.
I wasn't to know. I tried. I tried.
But what do you want her for?
You've got me.
Well, you've got me! You've got me!
Here, have a drink of this.
It will do you good.
- Now what was it?
- She went down there to find me... and the next thing she knew, somebody had attacked her.
Something about a man with burning eyes staring at her.
I saw him. I know I did.
No, love. It was in your mind.
You just thought you saw him, that's all.
She may have fainted.
Do you think she should go to bed?
Yes, come upstairs and rest.
No, I can't. I must go home.
Mother will be wondering where I am.
Just until you feel a little better, Maria.
I can't understand it.
Now come on up.
Destroy her.
It's all right, darling.
There's nobody here.
Paul?
I must have been dreaming.
Here, drink this.
Then I'll take you home.
No, you can't. My mother will see.
But if you tell her what happened....
No, how can I?
I don't even know what happened myself.
She'd be furious if she knew I'd come here.
I could explain.
No, I don't suppose that would help much either.
I'm all right, really.
When shall I see you again?
I don't know.
I'll try and come tomorrow.
If not, I'll get a message to you.
I'll come with you part of the way anyway.
- Where have you been?
- Mother....
You've been with Paul?
I know it looks like...
What does it look like?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Maria.
Ernst!
Maria, my darling.
Ernst!
Girls. Unreliable, the whole lot of them.
Come and go just as they please.
No sense of responsibility.
That's what I like about you, Paul.
I can rely on you.
That Zena hasn't turned up all day.
- Went off and never said she was going.
- She was here last night.
Last night. I know all about last night.
What's the matter with you today?
Off with some student, I suppose.
Come back again in about a fortnight and want her job back.
Father.
Will you do something for me?
Will you go and find out how Maria is?
Go to her home?
Yes, she lives with her uncle, the Monsignor.
You must know him.
Will you go and find out how she is and give her this note?
- Very well.
- Thanks.
- I brought you some soup, Maria.
- Thank you, Uncle Ernst.
Sit up now.
Drink it while it's....
I've forgotten a spoon.
It doesn't matter, Uncle Ernst.
I'm not hungry.
Uncle Ernst... please forgive me.
There, there.
Do you love him, Maria?
- Yes, I do.
- Do you want to tell me about it?
Not now.
All right. When you're ready.
Sleep now.
God bless you, Maria.
Father, what happened?
Maria. How is she? Is she well?
Did you give her the note?
- Yes.
- And?
- And?
- She is well.
- When can I see her?
- Not yet.
Later she will come here to see you.
- When?
- As soon as she can.
- You are still working here, are you?
- Sorry, Max.
Come on. I need you.
She was lying here just like this.
Not moving and scarcely breathing.
She's sick. She's very sick.
- Was the window open?
- Yes.
Yes, it was open, just like this.
I didn't touch it.
You think she's caught a chill, is that it?
Possibly.
The night air can be treacherous at this time of year.
- Possibly.
- Ernst, shouldn't we call the doctor?
If she's not better tomorrow.
Tomorrow, yes.
- How is she?
- Sleeping like a child.
Did you close the window?
- Yes, but on such a warm night.
- Good.
Don't stay up too late, Ernst.
Good night, Anna.
You.
Maria.
There, my love. Tell me, what is it?
Maria, tell me what happened. What is it?
Anna.
Anna, help me!
Oh, dear God!
Here, lean on me.
Anna... you must go.
You must get him to come here.
- You should rest.
- No, Anna.
Listen to me.
You must fetch that boy.
- The one who was here.
- Paul?
- Bring him here to me.
- Why Paul?
Because he loves her. He will help her.
- I'll go now, Ernst.
- No. Anna.
Perhaps it is better you do not go until daylight.
Count Dracula is alive.
During the hours of darkness... she must never be left alone.
You understand that?
Not for one moment must you leave her side.
Protect yourself as best you can.
There are devices which may be of some effect:
Charms, herbs.
You will find it all here.
You are a scholar of sorts, I understand.
- Well, I....
- They are all in Latin.
Do the best you can. What little time....
- I'll get a doctor.
- No time.
You must swear to do what I have told you.
- I promise.
- You should swear by almighty God... but you have denied yourself this.
You have my word.
I know I have.
Thank you.
Anna, the boy must stay here.
Yes, of course. Hurry. Get your things.
Come back quickly.
There is much to do before dark.
- What on earth are you doing?
- Keep my job open for me.
I'll explain later.
Father, I need your help. Hurry up.
Come with me, please. Please hurry.
What happened?
"The flowers of garlic should be placed...
"on either side of the head of the one to be protected.
"No more than a hand's breadth away from the throat.
"The oil from the clove of garlic...
"should be smeared around the edges of any aperture in the wall...
"doors and windows...
"lest the vampire try to gain ingress."
He meant to give it to her for her birthday.
It's all right, Frau Muller.
You go and rest.
I promise you,
I'll call you if I need you.
Why don't you go and rest, Father?
No.
Yes. You go and lie down. I can manage.
I can't!
What are you trying to do?
- He told me to do it.
- He who?
- Who told you?
- Dracula.
Dracula?
How could he tell you? You, a priest?
- Where is he?
- He willed me to do it.
I cannot disobey him.
Now I'm willing you. Do you understand?
Now I'm willing you. Do you understand?
- First you'll tell me where he is.
- No, I can't.
- Second, you'll take me to him.
- No.
You will take me to him, now!
Quickly, before he wakes.
Quickly.
You must do it now!
Pray! You must pray!
- I can't!
- You must.
- You must, or he won't die.
- You pray! You're a priest!
You pray!
He won't die!
He isn't going to die!
Maria!
Maria, get away from here!
Now my revenge is complete.
- What's the matter, lad?
- Max.
It's Maria.
Good evening. It isn't often we see strangers in these parts.
There's a castle somewhere in the mountains here... belonging to a Count Dracula.
- Do you know him?
- We know who you mean.
I have to go there.
- Why? It's empty. There's no one there.
- Not for long. He's on his way here.
- Dracula? Impossible.
- It's true. It's true. I swear it.
- He's dead. He died months ago.
- No, he's alive.
- He's alive, and he's coming here.
- Then you brought him. You brought him here.
Why can't you leave us alone?
Why must you meddle?
- Please listen to me.
- Quiet!
Let me by!
- I must get by!
- Be silent!
Please, I have to follow.
If you take my advice, you'll go straight back to where you came from.
Will someone show me the way to the castle?
You won't get anyone to go up there with you, son. Not even in daylight.
Will someone just show me the way then?
Surely one of you has got the courage to do that.
- Come on then.
- You're not going anywhere!
We're sick of people interfering with our lives.
And if we leave things alone, then maybe he'll leave us alone.
But he's evil, and while he's alive, none of you will be safe.
Take him upstairs and lock him up until he cools off.
No, let him go.
He'll be sorry.
Get that thing out of my sight.
Throw it away!
Maria!
Paul!
Amen.

I go to that house, to call the police.
You two stay here . 
April should be back any minute.
You're right, but I'll wait near the fire.
Maybe I 'll call . I hope you have a phone there.
If no , take a flashlight and illuminate several times.
Gritare high enough that the police 4 counties heard.
One more thing .
To perfect neck line 
. Turn around for me.
I'm tired . 
I loose . This is ridiculous .
Do you say to me, \"ridiculous\" ?
I never heard of anything like this before . This is not a way of painting .
Put me down !
You will be immortalized in a fabric Sorg , like it or not .
Turn around !
Do what I ask . 
Turn around.
- Count to twenty and open ended 
- . What ?
Stay that way . 
No! Do not turn !
For the love of ... 
Once. Twelve.
I'm not having fun, sr . Sorg . 
Tell one to twenty.
Thirteen . Fourteen .
I can use ... 
April !
- What the hell 's going on here 
- What are you doing with that ax ?
I'm just working with an idea.
That's her young boyfriend . 
Invite them to happen.
I'm already inside . 
Where is your phone ?
I have no phone . 
You're tough , young man.
You also would be rude if see her tied girl.
And a man with an ax in hand and blood in the other.
- And a corpse on the beach 
. - A corpse ?
- April , do not you're doing here ... 
-Stay away from her!
Quiet ! If arriving come flying your head.
Well , that ... Girl the beach ... it was a misunderstanding.
- Nothing about it 
- . I do not believe that.
First, not say it was a girl.
And how would know that is a girl unless you 've killed ?
Young man, is making a mistake .
And let ...
If you approach this weapon , le delivery head.
And that girl on the beach ... it was nothing .
He could live or die , and it would not matter.
But now , she will live forever, in my fabric.
She is immortal 
. She will live forever.
That beach thing ... is just an empty shell. Just that.
But life and blood it is what lives .
That keeps it alive . 
She's alive in my painting .
His life, his blood ... people 's admired forever.
Does her blood ? 
You use it as ink?
Now , young man , get away from that weapon or your girl dies now.
Stay away from that gun and stay aside. Stay away from that gun !
Hey , man, is just a crazy game over !
Stop !
Oh , my God !
Oh , no!
I do not buy a painting for some time.
You must have courage , my friend, to destroy a painting worth millions .
Mr. Gregorovich , I'm not burn a painting.
I 'm lighting the pyre 
Funeral Adam Sorg .
You could , at least , have saved the molding.
Let me die.
Let me die.
I should've known he was as good as dead when they wheeled him in.
You did everything possible, everything you could, Dr. Cortner.
Everything?
Everything except save my patient.
Everything in the books.
Now, Dad, do I have permission to take over and try things my way?
The operating room is no place to experiment.
He's dead, I can't do any harm.
Very well.
The corpse is yours.
Do what you want to do.
All right.
Make an opening into the chest cavity.
Apply 100 milliamps of current directly to the heart, then massage by hand.
I'll handle the brain area.
- By yourself?
- By myself!
I've got to work fast, if it isn't too late.
You talk as if he's still alive.
He is!
I just picked up a faint pulse beat.
Keep massaging the heart.
I am, I am.
These electric shocks should stimulate the motor area enough to enervate the heart again.
Then he won't need any external stimuli.
Keep away from the motor area.
You'll paralyze him for good.
Which would you rather be:
Paralyzed or dead?
Don't try to play God.
Some choices are not yours to make.
When the obstetrician has to decide which to save, the mother or the child, who plays God then?
- It's part of the game.
- The game?
The human body is not a jigsaw puzzle to experiment on.
Still playing it safe like the other doctors, hmm?
Might as well save my breath.
Keep massaging the heart.
You've already lost your patient, doctor.
I'm going to save mine.
His pulse is coming back stronger than ever.
It's unbelievable.
Nothing is unbelievable if you have the nerve to experiment.
I've been working on something like this for weeks. In your laboratory?
I knew this would work, if only I had the opportunity...
You don't conduct experiments on people.
You should be sure of the results first.
I am now.
Stop massaging the heart.
Let's see if it can take over by itself.
All right.
Close up the chest.
I'm about finished with the cerebral area.
How's his pulse?
Strong and steady.
Yeah, you did perform a miracle.
I may not approve of your methods but...
I am proud of your results.
That was an amazing...
Even an extraordinary operation, son.
But it still is too risky.
Too uncontrolled.
Saved his life.
And the aftereffects, what about them?
You've lost the urge to experiment.
To explore.
You don't explore on people.
Before you put a scalpel to one, an operation like this needs testing under every condition.
Over and over again.
Rabbits, mice, monkeys!
Not people!
That man who should be dead now won't think so.
There's more to surgery than just being a carpenter to patch up walls.
Or a plumber to drain pipes.
Our bodies are capable of adjusting in ways we've hardly dreamt of.
If we can only find the key.
I'm so close now, so very close.
The key to what?
Complete transplantations.
To be able to transplant limbs and organs.
To be able to replace diseased and damaged parts of the body as easily as we replace eye corneas now.
So that the new parts will join together as though they were born there.
It can't be done!
It can be done!
With my new special compound
I've created, I'll do it, I know I can do it!
Sure, sure, that's what you say!
That's what I know!
I know I'm close!
Darling, I'm so proud of you
I could kiss you!
Promises, huh? Always promises.
Careful, your father is liable to report us.
And stop the floor show?
When you two are married it won't be fun to watch anymore.
Well, I can promise you one thing.
Your grandchildren won't be test tube babies.
You better hurry if you wanna catch that plane to Denver, Dad.
And you know that medical convention can't start without you.
Um, Jan, you'd better check about my reservations.
Oh, yes, I'll call the airport.
I'll be right back.
Bill.
The line between scientific genius and obsessive fanaticism is a thin one.
Now I want you on the right side of it.
If I don't experiment, how can I hope to perform operations like the one you almost messed up?
But I can't cover up for you anymore.
The superintendent had it out with me.
He thinks it's you who's been stealing those limbs from the amputee operations.
So what if it is?
I've got to have limbs for my transplant experiments.
Well, you said test and experiment, test and experiment!
Yes, but limbs and organs taken from people!
I've got to have them to work with.
Sure, I've made a few mistakes.
But I've learned from them, I've learned!
Your reservations are all set,
3:30 take off.
Well, what have you two planned for the weekend?
Oh, nothing much.
Just a quiet weekend.
Are you sure you're not going up to the country house?
You're always sneaking off up there.
That place gives me the creeps,
I should've sold it when your mother died.
You can't sell that place!
I mean it's nice to get away from the city,
I can work without anyone snooping around.
You spent too much time up there.
All right, I'll see you both in a few days.
I've got to clean up and get out of here.
Fine operation or not, Bill, you're walking on thin ice.
But don't go too far!
Oh, every time you touch me,
I go out of my mind.
I wanna kiss you.
Bill, I wanna get married,
I can't stand not having you!
You've been wonderful!
Oh, I'd rather be a bride.
In a few more weeks.
Then nothing will keep us apart.
We'll be together.
Dr. Cortner!
I'm so glad you're here.
I was afraid you'd gotten away.
There is a very important phone message that came to you, it sounded quite urgent.
I have been looking everywhere.
It was from a man called Kurt.
He called from the country place, and he said something terrible had happened, and he wanted you to come right out.
Thank you.
Well, you've always wanted to know what's kept me away from you so many weekends.
Have you got the keys to your car?
Why haven't you ever taken me up here before?
Because the things I'm working on don't need an audience.
That telephone call, what about it?
All right, all right, hold off the questions.
Why the mystery, Bill?
What's this all about?
We'll be there soon enough, you'll see.
I've got to hurry.
Kurt? Kurt!
- All right, all right!
- For God's sake open the door!
I'm coming!
What's the matter?
- What's happened to you?
- There's been a terrible accident.
I've got to save her,
I've got to save her.
What is it, what have you got there?
Kurt, please! Sterilize the tubes and instruments, quickly!
Well, what are you going to do? Aren't you going to have a look in the closet first?
- Oh, I can't now, this is more important.
- But you don't understand!
For God's sake, Kurt, this is urgent, do as I tell you before it's too late,
I can't waste precious time arguing with you!
The eyelids!
I saw them move!
It can't be!
My eyes are deceiving me.
What you see is real.
What's done is done and what I've done is right.
It's the work of science.
I remember...
Fire.
Burning.
Let me die.
Let me die.
I've had success with transplants, now I can do it for her.
Transplant her onto what?
I brought her back, she'll live, and I'll get her another body.
I can make her complete again.
Only a madman can believe that she could ever be like before!
Don't argue with me.
I love her too much to let her stay like this.
I'll restore her as before.
You'll see.
Can't you realize?
Can't you see?
There's a pattern to all that lives!
An order, an arrangement.
She had a heart, and a brain, and her spirit was in both, not in one or the other!
No.
I'll give her a brain and a heart.
Yes, and what of her soul?
You say you love her and... you can remember her love for you.
Then how can you make of her an experiment of horror?
All the skill and science
I possess was meant for this.
Life has a pattern.
The whole pattern of my life is shaping itself to save her now.
- Then you intend to go through with it?
- Yes.
Sleep, my darling.
Rest and grow stronger.
How long do you think we can keep her alive under these conditions?
48, 50 hours at the most.
Yes.
And you really believe you can work a transplant on her?
Successfully?
Yes.
Like my arm?
Withered and deformed.
Yours was an early experiment that failed.
With her I'm using my new Adreno-Serum.
It must work.
I... I've got to go now.
If the police, or anyone, call, tell them you don't know anything about it.
I don't think anyone will trace us here because her body was burned in the wreckage.
Yes, yes, of course, of course.
Look, Bill, before you go, do have a look in that closet.
It's the reason why I called you up here.
Keep it locked!
Last night it go so violent, it almost broke out!
Oh, no, not through that thickness.
Keep it closed.
I've got to think about her now.
I've got to find her a body.
How are you going to go about getting one?
Bill, how will you do it?
There are ways.
There are ways.
What took you so long?
What made you think I'd come?
You know a good thing when you see it.
Yeah, there was plenty to see.
I liked your act.
Is that all you liked?
Well, your costume, what there was of it, was interesting.
Is that all?
The rest of the equipment is standard.
But, uh, the arrangement is pretty special.
You're no tourist just looking at the sights.
What are you doing here, slumming?
Oh, I get my allowance once a week.
Okay, if you're so loaded, you pay for the drinks.
I already did.
Are you hustling for the house?
I hustle for myself.
I'm the leading lady around here,
I can sit with the squares out front or I can relax back here with my friends.
I'll bet you you don't have an enemy in the world.
Let me die.
Let me die.
Where are you from?
Oh, around.
Just looking around.
When you get done looking, then what?
I operate.
I get your message, you're coming across.
You could flip any chick in the house, why me?
Well, like I said, I'm looking.
Well, you don't have to look any further.
I'm not gonna fake it for you.
When do you go on again, huh, when?
Relax, I got another show yet.
But it could be for you.
Oh, I was just asking.
Try taking.
Are you getting nervous?
I'm over 21.
Oh, it isn't that, it's...
I've just got things to do.
Things to take care of.
Well, if that's anything that makes you sick what could be more important that could be taken care of right now?
Oh, I've, uh, I've got to see about helping somebody.
Somebody who needs my help very badly.
You can't cut out on me now, baby.
Not when you've got me feeling so good.
I'm so warm all over.
I'm good for you.
I know I'm good for what you want.
You may be just what I'm looking for.
You've got your nerve.
Oh, look who's talking.
Why don't you haul your beat-up body back to the bar with the rest of the flies?
Keep your g-string on.
I only came in here to change my clothes.
I got admission.
Now I'd like to see the rest of the show.
Come back in half an hour and maybe you will.
Get lost.
Hi, loverboy.
I see you've met the queen.
Hey.
Come here, don't hide.
You know you've got the kind of face a girl doesn't mind looking at.
Even out front all the other girls were asking about you.
Get out of here.
Two's company, three's a crowd.
Who's to tell me to blow if I don't want to?
This here is my dressing room too, remember?
It kills her to see me make time.
You're the only thing that's going to be made around here tonight, honey.
Eat your heart out.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
Yeah, well, uh, I'd better be going, hmm?
What for?
Look what you've done! You come busting in here with your two cents.
Let me see you later.
I'll make everything up to you,
I swear I will.
Yeah, come on back later.
I'll remember you.
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
You lousy tramp.
Once in a blue moon I latch onto a guy with class and you mess it up.
Eh.
What makes you think you had him?
He wouldn't have you on a bet.
- Says who?
- Says me.
What's a guy like that want with leftovers for?
Leftovers?
Why, you cheap third-rate stripper!
Let go!
- There.
- No!
I'll mash you like a bug.
- Don't you cry.
- Watch out.
You.
Inside the closet.
What has he done to you?
I know there's someone there.
Knock once if you hear me.
Then I'm not the first.
Knock twice if I'm not the first.
He should've let me die.
I hate him for what he's done to me.
If he only knew what it's like being like this.
Do you know what it's like?
Together we could have revenge.
You want revenge?
Yes.
You the thing inside, and me the thing out here.
My brain is still untouched.
And his keeping me alive has given me a power he didn't count on.
A power that you can feel.
Across this room and through that door.
Can't you?
Together we're both more than things.
We're a power as hideous as our deformities.
Together we'll wreak our revenge.
I shall create power and you will enforce it.
You, the thing inside.
Me, the thing out here.
What's locked behind that door?
Horror.
No normal mind can imagine.
Something even more terrible than you.
No, my deformed friend.
Like all quantities, horror has its ultimate.
And I'm that.
No.
There is a horror beyond yours, and it's in there.
Locked behind that door.
The paths of experimentation twist and turn through mountains of miscalculation and often lose themselves in error and darkness.
Behind that door is the sum total of Dr. Cortner's mistakes.
He had no right to bring me back to this.
Perhaps not. Who knows?
But you should know... that before he injected the serum into that, it was but a mass of grafted tissues.
Lifeless.
It just lay there, weighted down with its transplants of broken limbs and amputated arms.
But with this serum, it began to breathe.
That's impossible.
Would you have thought possible what he has already done?
Take yourself.
He has brought you back.
You live!
And only a few years ago, all transplants were impossible.
That's what he's been doing up here where no one could see his work?
Yes.
Experimenting with transplants on that... and on me.
Letting him tear away my flesh time after time, test after test.
My hopes shattering with each grafted arm he fastened to me.
Watching it wither and warp.
Instead of strengthening.
Now you see, he's learned from his mistakes.
And you stayed with him.
Helping him in his grotesque work that he claims is for science.
Was there a place for me on the outside with this?
In a world where eyes would look upon me with pity and people would turn away from me in disgust.
No, the alcoholic has his bottle.
The dope addict his needle.
I had my research.
I used to be a surgeon. It was my life.
Then one night in the laboratory, there... there was an accident.
They had to amputate my arm.
And...
He has used you, too...
I had no choice.
He was my only hope.
A surgeon needs both his arms, not just one.
Well, you see, my transplanted grotesqueness stayed, and so did I.
I live only for the day he can work a successful transplant to my body.
That is why I stay.
Transplant... my head onto another body?
Yes.
And he's insane with the belief he can do it.
But the tissues of my body would reject the tissues of another.
Reject it as the foreign substance it is.
The transplant would never take, it would never stay in place.
My blood's antibodies would attack it as they attack any invading matter.
Yes, but his new discovery, this new serum, may change all of that.
This serum, injected into the bloodstream, affects the lymphoid tissues.
Here in the neck, the lymphoids that provide the antibodies for the blood that detect foreign transplanted matter.
It was untested, untried.
Until we used it on you.
So that liquid in the blood that's being pumped through what's left of me... is what makes me feel the...
He may produce results he didn't ask for.
Results?
You mean, like this?
Results more terrible than your arm of relative beauty.
Results of power.
Of magnitude.
Power?
What power?
Can't you see that you're at the mercy of every element of the universe?
How can you speak of power?
I have a power.
This liquid that's he's pumped into me, my brain burns with it.
That thing inside and I are in touch.
Want me to prove it?
Oh, you can prove nothing.
You're powerless!
I'll show you how powerless I am.
You.
Behind that door.
Let me know if you hear me.
Whoever, whatever you are...
I command you.
You understand me?
I'm only a head and you're whatever you are.
Together we're strong!
More powerful than any of them.
What are you running from?
What's wrong with you?
Oh, it's you.
There's something wrong, something beyond control in that room.
There's nothing beyond my control.
She's alive and I'll keep her alive until I find her a body.
I can't talk anymore, I'm tired,
I've got to go to sleep.
Then you... you didn't find her a body?
Well, I've got to be careful.
I can't afford to be identified as the last person seen with a girl before she disappears.
Do you think you'll get one?
There are many things left for tomorrow.
Hi, I was about to call a cop the way you were looking me over.
How have you been, Bill?
Oh, just fine, Donna.
I haven't seen you for quite a while.
Too long, I'm still waiting for that call you once promised me.
Ah, you know how it is with interns.
All work.
All work and no play even makes for dull doctors.
You're gonna lose that bedside manner of yours.
Say, how about a little side course in anatomy?
- Yours, anytime!
- No, not mine.
A Body Beautiful contest, you know, bathing suit models, plenty of females on the hook.
Your eyes will have a field day, interested?
Oh, why not?
You're just what the doctor ordered.
Come on, jump in.
Ah, on second thought...
I just remembered I've got to stop by my place and take care of a few things.
It'll only take a minute.
You don't mind, do you?
I always follow the doctor's orders.
Anything you prescribe, I'll take.
That's what I like about you, Donna.
Always so obliging.
Hey, Donna, where are you going, what's the hurry?
Hey, Jeannie, we're going to look for some bodies.
- You mean the contest?
- Yeah.
- Got any room for me?
- Oh, sure, plenty.
Bill, this is Jeannie Reynolds.
Jeannie, this is Dr. Bill Cortner.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Hop in, first we gotta stop off at his place.
- Sure.
Well, as a matter of a fact, that can wait.
Now that there's two of you, it will have to wait.
Guess he thinks there's safety in numbers.
Oh, this time there is.
We promise not to hurt you.
And I promise not to hurt you.
- Oh, Bill, there's a seat.
- Oh, there looks fine.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Well, it looks like we're about ready to go.
Backstage are five of the girls who have reached the contest finals, and we are here to choose
Miss Body Beautiful.
Now we've eliminated everyone except the five finalists and they will be judged solely by your applause. So let's bring them on.
First... Helen Appleton.
Betty Brockton!
Terri Lund!
Peggy Howard!
She has the second nicest body
I've ever seen.
- What, second to you?
- No, another girl, a figure model.
You remember that one in school, years ago. The one who had the accident.
Oh, yeah, yeah, Doris, uh...
- Doris Powell.
- Yeah, is she still around?
Few people see her nowadays.
She just stays in her studio posing for art classes and camera bugs.
A figure model.
Poses for art classes.
The nicest body she's ever seen.
The nicest body.
Maybe this is the one. She's got to be!
I can keep Jan alive only for a few more hours.
I've got to find her a body.
He... he intends to kill somebody.
To rob them of their body.
Do you hear me?
Yes, you hear me.
You know how Bill's egotism drives him on and on.
To infamy upon infamy.
How can good ever be born of evil?
Yet he claims his work is for science.
For humanity.
To be joined to flesh not your own.
What's human in this?
Of how you must exist?
Locked behind that door.
We've got to stop him!
- Okay, boys, I've had it for today.
- Come on baby, one more.
- Just one more, please!
- Another five minutes, baby!
- Time's just about up anyway.
- Okay.
Say, Doris?
Would you like to have a drink with me?
Just you and me, away from everybody, some place where nobody will butt in, where you and I can really be alone.
No, thank you.
How about posing for me, private-like?
I'll pay you real money, real good money.
The kind of money they don't throw at you everyday and for doing hardly nothing at all.
I do my posing for classes only,
Wednesdays and Saturdays 8:00 to 10:00.
- Yeah, I know, but we can...
- Goodnight.
See it all, mister?
The show's over.
Next time bring a camera and buy a ticket.
I'm not running a charity!
You don't remember me, do you, Doris?
Every guy on the make gives me that same tired line.
I'm Bill Cortner.
Bill Cortner.
Long time ago, that fight.
- You almost tore that wise guy apart
- for making fun of me.
After my accident.
Look, uh, can't we go somewhere and talk?
No, I don't date men.
Because I pose like I do, your mind works overtime.
You get ideas.
You're all alike.
No, not all of us.
I'm not on the make for you.
Okay, so maybe you're better than most.
Maybe not. I still hate all men.
I hate them for what one did to me once.
Have you forgotten?
Well, have you?
No, I haven't forgotten.
Well, neither have I.
I carry the memory around with me.
Yeah, but you can't hide yourself away here forever.
Posting bare in front of a bunch of neurotics.
Listen, Galahad.
I trusted a man once, all the way!
What did it get me? He gets his head full of jealous lies and I get...
- You've got to forget what happened!
- How can I forget?
I carry the memory around with me.
Permanently!
Am I so appealing to you now?
Still so interested?
Doesn't it make you sick?
You don't even turn away from me, like everyone else does.
To me you're not ugly.
I see only beauty in you.
You have a lovely body and a face that can be made beautiful again also.
Yeah.
I've heard that song before.
I'm a doctor, I know. My father is one of the leading plastic surgeons, if anyone can help you, we can, I know I can.
I've been to doctors, it's no use.
The scar tissue's too deep.
No one can help me!
Ah, ah, that was a few years ago.
Today nothing is hopeless.
Yeah, we can graft scar and skin tissue that...
Why we can even freeze areas of the skin, and sand away damaged skin tissues.
The way you say that, that look in your eyes.
I almost wanna believe you.
I almost wanna believe you!
Well, then start believing, hmm?
Even if your father could help me, I couldn't pay him the kind of money it would take.
Oh, don't talk about money, he does a lot of work without any charge.
Why should you wanna do this for me?
What's in it for you?
I'm gonna make your face beautiful again, cut it off and give your body away.
I'm sorry.
Bill...
I have been knocked around so many times...
I've lost count!
It's tough living with this.
I don't mean to sound ungrateful.
Well, because you've been battered around, don't go sour.
You shouldn't lose your trust in people.
Not all of us.
I believe you, I want to.
Do you really think something can be done?
Only my father knows.
Look, we have a country place just out of town.
He's visiting for the weekend. I could take you there now for a consultation.
You mean tonight?
Well, if you'd rather wait till he comes back, if he comes back.
No, no, I mean, he wouldn't be annoyed, being bothered with me so late at night?
Well, you let me do the worrying, huh?
I'll do anything that'll help me get rid of this face.
Well, that's where I come in.
Remember the last time I helped you?
Where are you going?
Who are you calling?
My girlfriend,
I want to tell her the news.
Before you know what the verdict is gonna be?
You're right, I shouldn't talk until I know what's going to happen.
My girlfriend, she's supposed to drop in later,
- I'll have to leave her a note or something.
- Well, just tell her you'll see her later.
Otherwise she'll ask a lot of nosy questions.
We wanna be sure first.
- Just throw something on, huh?
- I'll be with you in a minute.
Just tell her you'll keep in touch.
I'll leave it on the table, she'll see it.
Had to go out with old friend Bill Cortner.
I'll call you tomorrow, Doris.
Here.
I'll leave it on the lamp.
She'll see it, won't she?
That's the first place she'll look.
I'll leave the lights on for her.
Hmm.
I have waited so long for this.
So have I.
Again!
Hit it again!
I've got to see your hideousness.
And you've got to see mine.
I wonder which of us is more awful.
Nothing you can be is more terrible than what I am.
A head without a body.
A head that should be in its grave.
I hate him.
I hate him for what he's done to me.
Can your horror match mine?
Quiet, someone's coming.
I have come to feed your friend.
While you feed yourself with hate, it prefers food.
Your former sniveling fear becomes you more.
Eh.
What makes you think
I'm afraid of what's in there?
Or of you?
A mere head in search of a body.
People fear what they don't understand.
And what they can't see.
Oh, what are you talking about?
You're nothing but a freak of life!
And a freak of death!
Why should I be afraid of a few knocks on a door?
But last night you ran.
You were afraid of what you imagined lay behind that door.
I?
Imagined?
It was I who helped graft together the bits and pieces that were stolen from the hospital.
An amputated arm, a leg, a torso.
It was I who helped piece 'em together like a monstrous jigsaw puzzle!
And that same medicine that he's fed to me to activate my lymphoid tissues.
Has he fed it to that?
No.
No, on that he used an earlier formula.
It wasn't as successful as the serum he's using on you.
But it was enough to allow the transplants to take.
If your experiment is successful... oh, then it'll be my turn.
And what else has happened to it?
What do you mean, what else?
Well, it's...
It's mutated some, of course.
It's changed considerably.
Why don't you open the door?
Then we'll both see how it's changed.
Listen, you. I warned you.
You better stop pestering me, do you hear?
I'm getting fed up with you and your insidious talk.
He should've cut out your tongue while he was at it!
Afraid?
Afraid of whom? Of you?
No. Not anymore.
But of it?
Nor of it.
He only keeps it locked in there so that... it will be safe, that's all.
Safe?
From me?
Oh, you beast.
I hope he prolongs your existence into a lifetime of agony.
Then we'll see who's laughing at whom!
You miserable fool!
Get him!
- Get him!
- Oh, my arm, oh!
Kill him!
You and your father live here?
Only on weekends when we wanna get away from the city.
This place certainly is lonely.
Well, the further from prying eyes the better.
I mean it's nice and quiet here, we can get away from the noise and telephones.
Oh, I guess it is.
Well, sit down, sit down,
I'll fix us a drink, huh?
My father should be back soon.
You mean he's not here now?
Oh, come on now, Doris.
Do I look like a maniac who goes around killing girls?
Now, you've got to learn to trust people.
Well, people like me, really.
Oh, I'm sorry. I trust you.
I trust you with my life.
Well, I can't ask for anymore than that.
I'll be right back.
Oh, I was beginning to think you'd forgotten about me.
Forgotten you? Oh, Doris, you've become very important to me.
Very important. I put a little water in it, so it wouldn't be too strong for you.
Fine, I'm not a very heavy drinker.
Neither am I.
Well, um, here's to your future.
Whatever it may be.
I'll drink to that.
Oh, it's getting awfully warm in here.
I feel kind of funny.
Bill?
You put something in my drink!
Didn't you?
I told you I'd bring you a body.
A beautiful one.
Soon it will be yours.
Bill, you can't!
Yes, I can!
I want you as a complete woman, not part of one.
Is it a crime to wanna keep you alive?
Is it a crime for science to jump ahead by years?
This kind of thing must be done.
When it's over, you'll see.
I've got to hurry now.
The drug will wear off soon and she'll be awake.
When she does come to, it will be your head consciously awakening for her.
You must be stopped!
You must!
And who's going to do it?
Now it's got to be quiet here.
You can't stop me.
Very well.
I told you to let me die.
Still feel like you're on a ship?
A little.
I'll drop this film off, then we can go back to my flat and you can have a rest before dinner.
Tonight I'm gonna show you London.
Pat, if you're worried about staying in my flat, we can book you into a hotel until we get married.
Oh, no, it's not that.
- It's Stephen's mother.
- Mrs Trefoile?
I've been meaning to tell you something since we left New York.
Just before we sailed I received a letter from her asking if I was coming to England.
And?
Well, I wrote her back saying I was.
- On a holiday. I didn't mention you.
- That's nice.
Well, I didn't see any point in upsetting her.
All right. You wrote back, and...?
- Now, don't shout.
- I'm not shouting.
I told her I'd go see her.
I want to go before we get settled.
Alan, I want to start a completely new life with you.
I don't want any part of that other life hanging over us.
And it will if I don't see
Stephen's mother now.
- Now?!
- Ah-ah. You're shouting.
Come on, out of the car.
You're going to meet my producer, Oscar.
Alan, you're not listening to me.
I'm not listening, because you're talking nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.
- Would you mind taking my briefcase?
Alan.
Alan, I was engaged to her son.
And after the awful way he died,
I think it's only fair that I...
It's only fair to you to forget all about him.
I don't think I can forget all about him.
At least not until I see his mother.
- Alan, hello!
- Hi!
Great to see you back.
Let me help you with - 0h!
Hello, you must be Patricia.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
- You haven't lost your eye, old boy.
- Come on, love.
Alan, I told you...
- Darling, please.
- I'll just take the stuff up.
What are you trying to do?
I told you I'm going to visit Mrs Trefoile.
Now if you'll give me the keys to the car,
I'll visit her for an hour and be back this evening.
But it's too far.
You'll have to stay overnight.
All right, I won't even stay with her.
I'll get a room in a pub or something.
I'll be back tomorrow noon, then.
And if I order you not to?
Are you going to give me the keys to the car, or do I take a bus?
- You can drive?
- As well as you can.
It is not automatic. Use the clutch!
Oh!
- I'm Patricia Carroll.
- Come in.
Miss Carroll's here, Mrs Trefoile.
Mrs Trefoile?
My dear Miss Carroll.
What a pleasure to welcome you.
- Thank you.
- Had you any trouble getting here?
Not really.
People were very kind.
I trust your companion and your servant have been accommodated?
- My...?
- Anna, see to it.
Really, Mrs Trefoile, I'm quite alone.
Alone? My dear, how dangerous.
And foolish. Tea, Anna.
It was very kind of you to come and pay this visit to me.
Yes, I am pleased with Stephen's choice.
I see that you are obviously the type of young woman he would properly choose.
We have so much to discuss, my dear. So much.
My poor Stephen.
L...
I can only rejoice that he died unblemished.
A virgin soul.
So much more beloved by the Almighty.
Yes.
I have prayed for him.
And I know you have done so too.
And I have no doubt that he was at once transported to glory at his passing.
Being the unstained soul that he was.
We shall go to church together tomorrow and offer up a token prayer.
- I'm afraid I...
- Milk?
Please.
We will not pray at the regular service, however.
I do not approve of the new rector.
- Oh.
- Tell me about yourself, my dear.
Young, good family. Travelling all the way across the Atlantic without a companion.
Did you not find it lonesome?
No.
- No, I was all right.
- Do you attend church regularly?
Well, not too regularly.
Not as often as I'd like.
Not as often as you'd like?
What a strange thing to say.
If you like going to church, why do you not attend regularly?
Well, I mean... often, there isn't time.
Not time for prayer? Not time to sing the praises of the Lord?
One's duty to the Lord must take precedence, must it not?
Patricia, I'm surprised at you.
But you must want to rest after your tiring journey.
Anna! Come with me, my dear.
I will conduct you to your room. Anna?
Yes, Mrs Trefoile.
- The tea dishes to be washed at once.
- Miss Carroll will be staying for dinner.
- Yes, Mrs Trefoile.
- We shall be eating at the usual time.
- Yes, Mrs Trefoile.
- I wasn't planning to...
- Come along, my dear.
I must confess myself disappointed in your church attendance.
My late husband.
He was a truly religious man.
More so than some who wear the cloth.
- When did he...?
- He died the year Stephen was born.
- Harry.
- Yes, ma'am?
- Put Miss Carroll's car away in the shed.
- Yes, ma'am.
This was his room.
His?
Stephen's.
And this is your room, my dear.
I trust you will be comfortable, my dear.
I keep a modest establishment.
One must be careful with one's money these days.
But, if there's anything you desire...
My poor Stephen's love.
- Mrs Trefoile...
- Rest now. Rest.
We will talk at dinner.
All right, Alan, I know.
Don't shout.
I brought it on myself.
Stephen.
Stephen.
She's here, in this house, my darling.
But, of course, you know.
You know.
Mrs Trefoile?
One moment.
Come in.
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- Not at all. I was, erm...
Something you require?
- Yes, I wondered if you might have a mirror.
- A mirror?
Is it to adorn yourself, to observe yourself?
Mirrors are naught but tools of vanity, Patricia. I know.
Vanity, sensuality, Patricia.
The Bible speaks of our vile bodies.
Oh.
I knew you would understand.
Oh, how lovely.
What is that, a costume?
Mrs Trefoile, were you an actress?
God was good.
He led me from that evil.
- Evil?
- Yes.
A pit of evil.
A place for the lost and the damned.
The devil's entertainment.
God's anathema.
It is a painful memory to me.
But by the grace of our Lord, and the inspired inspiration of my late husband, no more than a memory.
I keep it as a harsh reminder of what I was.
Of what I escaped.
I think I will take that rest now.
It was a long drive.
I'll see you at supper, Mrs Trefoile.
All I asked for was a mirror.
Sheesh!
- What?
You're wanted at service, miss.
Service?
All right, I'll be right down.
Pretty.
You can leave that now, Joseph.
Pretty.
You are late, Patricia.
You must learn to be more punctual.
I shall read from Deuteronomy.
Chapter 1, Verse 1.
"These be the words which
Moses spake unto all Israel.
"On this side of Jordan in the wilderness in the plain over against the Red Sea.
"Between Paran and Tophel and
Laban and Hazaroth and Dizahab."
Verse 2. "There are eleven days' journey from Horeb.
"By the way of Mount Seir, unto Kadesh-barnea."
Amen.
Praise ye the Lord.
Verse 3.
"And it came to pass in the 40th year,
"in the eleventh month of the first day of the month
"that Moses spake unto the children of Israel
"according to all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them."
Verse 4.
"After he had slain Sihon the King of the Amorites which dwelt in Hesbon
"and of the king of Bashan."
Verse 5.
"On this side of Jordan, in the land of
Moab, began Moses to declare this law,
"saying: The Lord, our God spake unto us in Horeb..."
Verse 20.
"Thou shall eat it before the
Lord thy God year by year
"in a place the Lord shall choose for thou and thou household."
- Praise ye the Lord.
- Verse 21.
"If there be any blemish therein as if it be lame
"or blind or have any ill blemish thou shall not sacrifice it unto the Lord thy God."
Verse 22.
"Thou shalt eat it within thy gates
"the unclean and the clean shall eat it alike as the roebuck, and as the hart."
Verse 23.
"Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof.
"Thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water."
Anna! You may serve the meal.
My foot fell asleep.
We thank thee, Lord, for this good food by thy grace is set before us.
We thank thee for the beneficence of thy everlasting grace and the constancy of thy dominion over heaven and earth and all that lie within.
Thank ye, Lord our God.
Aren't you hungry, my child?
Mrs Trefoile.
Do you have any salt?
We use no condiments of any kind in this house, Patricia.
God's food should be eaten unadorned. We are vegetarian.
For instance, this meat loaf is synthetic.
Compounded of bread, oatmeal and wheat germ.
How nice.
- Anna! Come here at once!
- Yes, Mrs Trefoile.
You have not washed up properly.
There is a mark on Miss Carroll's glass.
Oh, it's just my lipstick, Mrs Trefoile.
It will come off even though they guarantee.
Anna.
Go upstairs and wash it off immediately.
- Mrs Trefoile, I'm sorry, I...
- Go and remove that filth at once.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, this is ridiculous!
Lipstick!
All right, all right!
But just for this evening.
Oh, and then...
Come here, my dear.
Ah, that's better. Good.
But I detect scent.
I can't wipe that off, Mrs Trefoile.
You mustn't be angry with me for trying to instruct you in the error of your ways.
My darling, Stephen's love.
Mrs Trefoile, I must explain to you about Stephen and me.
Oh, how I feared for him, prayed for him.
He should not have left home.
He should not have left home.
He knew what temptations beset him away from home.
He knew what sin was in its many guises.
Yet, despite this, to leave me here alone.
He would not have died had he remained with me.
Now I must fear for his soul as well.
To have chosen you, so deep in error, yet looking so innocent.
Mrs Trefoile, just because I wear lipstick,
I can hardly be considered "deep in error".
Well, I shall labour to reclaim you for Stephen.
I must believe that he was not contaminated, that he died pure.
But we will start tomorrow.
It is late now.
Mrs Trefoile,
I'm afraid I can't stay.
- You see, I...
- You were expected for a lengthy visit.
I know, but I made arrangements to meet a friend of mine in London.
- A girlfriend.
- I see.
I must keep my appointment.
Very well, but not before tomorrow morning.
You must come to church with me and pray for Stephen's soul, and for yours.
Indulge me, my dear, just until tomorrow.
All right.
But I must phone my girlfriend and tell her.
I'm afraid you cannot do that, Patricia.
There is no telephone here.
You will not regret staying.
I promise you.
- Patricia?
- Yes?
You are a virgin, aren't you?
You are, aren't you?
Well, yes, but...
Thank God!
Am I a virgin?
Service at seven, miss.
You are not to be late.
Service at seven, breakfast at ten probably.
Good morning.
What are you wearing?
The devil's colour.
Go upstairs immediately and put on something proper!
- Yes, Mrs Trefoile.
- It's almost seven o'clock!
We must not fall behind the day's routine.
And Patricia, as I was telling you, even though that deluded rector has in literal effect closed the church to me,
I have, as you know, contrived to maintain proper service to the Lord in my own home.
As is said in Matthew, Chapter 20:
"Where two or three are gathered together
"in my name, there am I in the midst."
I read a book of Scripture each night and morning.
And when the entire book has been read, I begin anew.
This, naturally aside from my private prayer.
Naturally.
Since I've stopped attending regular services at the church,
I've read the Bible through nine, no, ten times.
Most earnestly have I prayed for the rector to be given understanding.
But he remains obstinate, proceeding in darkness.
Good morning, Mrs Trefoile.
A lewd man. I have had occasion to complain to the local magistrate.
He will allow Harry to drink to excess.
But then the magistrate is scarcely better.
I have forbidden Harry to enter the place. He claims he does not.
But of course he lies.
I would have discharged him years ago, were he not a relative of my late husband.
And I may do it yet, however.
I have many things to contend with,
Patricia, but I do not flag.
Make certain that your head is covered. Well covered.
Yes, ma'am.
We shall most earnestly pray for Stephen's soul and yours.
Come.
- We must go.
- You really needn't go, Mrs Trefoile.
- Evil man. Evil man.
- What did he do?
- Forswore his marriage vows.
- Really?
- And they let him stay on?
- Yes.
That is the depth to which this church is fallen.
He remarried, Patricia.
Two years after his first wife died he married again in this very church.
Is that what you meant?
When you said he forswore his marriage vows, you meant he remarried?
- You don't approve of...
- Approve?
How monstrously inconceivable.
On the day of Resurrection, to meet two wives!
Mrs Trefoile, there isn't a church in the world that doesn't allow second marriages after death.
- Well, some even allow...
- You condone this evil, then?
- Evil? People marrying twice?
- It's against God's law.
You have fallen into deeper error than I imagined.
But innocently so, I must believe, so as not to contaminate
Stephen beyond redemption.
- And you, a wedded woman?
- Wedded?
You cannot mean you do not realise you are, my child.
You are Stephen's wife.
A betrothal, a marriage, it is all the same in the eyes of God.
- Wife?
- You are Stephen's wife.
You should be grateful that you have been permitted to escape any gross parody consummation of that marriage.
And can live out your life as a virgin until it shall please God to call you to Stephen's side.
Mrs Trefoile.
Not only do I not consider myself
Stephen's wife, but I feel I must tell you that if Stephen hadn't died,
I wouldn't have married him anyway.
Would you get my car out, please?
Now, miss?
Right now.
Mrs Trefoile.
I know you're there.
Unlock this door.
Do you hear me?
Mrs Trefoile.
Open this door at once.
I don't know what you think you're doing.
She's insane.
Joseph!Joseph!Joseph!
I've got myself locked in.
Locked in.
Look, I only want you to...
Now, you listen to me,
Mrs Trefoile.
You are not going away.
I must save you from your baser self for Stephen's sake.
I understand you now, Patricia.
You never intended to remain true to dear Stephen.
So I must keep you.
Mrs...
Mrs Trefoile?
Hey, mister!
Will you let me out of this room, please?
Mrs Tref0ile's locked me in.
Now, I don't want to call the police or make any trouble, but if I don't get out of here immediately...
Will you, please?
Hey, didn't you hear me?
You're all going to be in a lot of trouble if you don't...
They are insane.
All of them!
Mrs Trefoile!
Mrs Trefoile!
Mrs Trefoile, I've been very patient with you, but if you...
PAT".
Help!
Get me out of here!
Get me out of here!
This is a most disgraceful situation.
I couldn't agree with you more.
Now, if you'll just be kind enough to stand back and let me out of this madhouse, I'll...
It is necessary that you stay, Patricia.
I cannot tell you how grieved
I am that it must be this way.
If you were not so firmly in the grasp of ignorance it might not be.
This gun is dangerous,
Patricia.
You know, of course, you're committing a crime?
Anna.
Anna!
Come on, miss.
Don't you touch me!
Anna, what do you think...?
Don't do this!
Anna!
Why are you doing this to me?!
Stop!
Stop it! Anna! Don't!
Please, don't!
You're hurting me.
Mrs Trefoile, I've put her in...
Mrs Trefoile?
Oh, yes.
Take her handbag and her luggage upstairs.
Yes, Mrs Trefoile.
You should wear pink more often, Anna.
It suits you.
You can take these things up to her.
- Where is she now?
- Upstairs. Back room.
- Who took her up there? You?
- I didn't notice you volunteering to help.
You watch it now. Don't want no trouble with the police.
You think they're gonna bother about you?
Don't you think they don't remember Harry?
What, after sixteen years?
Over a forged cheque?
No.
No, it's this.
It's the girl.
What's gonna happen if the police find out?
They mustn't find out.
But how are you gonna stop them?
She can't keep her up there forever.
What's she want to keep her there for, anyway?
For the good of her soul.
What? That's what she said.
- My God, she is barmy.
- And if she is?
That's her lookout.
Naturally.
Look! I haven't let her keep her foot on the back of my neck for sixteen bloody years just to throw it all down the drain now.
I'm her only living relative.
When she goes, all she has is mine.
Ours.
You can take these things up to her now.
You're in this as much as I am.
You're my wife.
Yes, I'm your wife.
Don't forget it when you're up there.
I brought your baggage, miss.
You people don't seem to realise the position you're in.
Miss?
I'm being held against my will.
That's a criminal offence.
Is it?
I suggest that you let me...
- You'd better let me out of here.
- Just like that?
- When the police find out...
- Miss, I only work here.
It's the old lady that locked you up.
You knew about it.
That makes you an...
A what, miss?
An accomplice.
A what, love?
Look, I'll...
I'll pay you to let me out of here.
In what way, love?
Don't!
You're not bad-looking, are you?
Not bad at all.
I just, er, brought in her luggage, ma'am.
Anna told me to.
- I shall return shortly to speak to you.
- I'm leaving now!
Strange, not to have been in my husband's room for 24 years.
What now?
A lecture on primitive religion?
Tobacco too.
Put it out.
Shall I have Anna put it out?
I am correct in my instruction from God.
I see more clearly every moment how right it is that I do this.
So sunk in error.
Anna, open her bags.
Leave my things alone!
You will remain where you are, Patricia.
This is needful and overdue destruction.
I pray that you will accept it as the first step to your salvation.
Scarlet again.
Destroy it!
Patricia!
Leave my...!
Hug?
I did not want you to be hurt.
But you must be brought into the fold, you understand.
You must be saved.
It is the duty laid upon me for Stephen.
Sacrifices.
It is necessary to make sacrifices.
Sometimes it is the only way.
Is that all?
Mrs Trefoile, I haven't had anything to eat in almost 24 hours.
Not because nothing has been offered you, child.
But because your palate is corrupted.
What do you intend to do?
Starve me into repentance?
If necessary.
To fast is excellent for the strengthening of the spirit.
I shall read from the Book of Judges.
Chapter 1.
Verse 1.
"Now, after the death of Joshua it came to pass
"that the children of Israel asked the Lord, saying:
'Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites..."'
Anna?
I'll give you a thousand pounds if you let me out of here.
It's not an idle offer, Anna.
My father is a very wealthy man.
You're speaking foolishness, Patricia.
Sit still and listen.
You'd have the money within a week.
I warn you, child, the more you fight against acceptance, the more...
2,000 pounds.
2,000 pounds, Anna!
Within a week.
How long would you have to work for Mrs Trefoile to earn that much?
You don't have to be afraid.
Can you see it, Anna?
Harry with 2,000 pounds at his disposal.
Daresay you'd never see the man again.
Would you?
Now, sit still and listen.
Verse 3. "And Judah said unto Simeon his brother:
'Come up with me into my lot that we may fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot."'
Very well.
I'll save my father's money.
Forget it, Anna.
I don't know why I offered it in the first place. It really isn't necessary.
I told you I was supposed to meet a friend of mine in London last night.
Well, when I don't show up, he'll know somethings wrong.
He?
That's right.
- He!
- You told me that it was a...
I lied, Mrs Trefoile.
Lied. It's not a woman.
It's a man.
A man.
It's the man I'm going to marry.
Marry, Mrs Trefoile.
And have there been others as well?
Did you lie to me about your virginity?
I am not by nature a vindictive person, Mrs Trefoile.
But believe me,
I'm going to take intense pleasure in seeing all of you arrested and put in jail.
Did you lie to me about being a virgin?
Guess.
Remove the tray, Anna.
There will be no tea or food until you show respect and answer me.
That's too high a price to pay,
Mrs Trefoile.
I'd rather starve.
Starve, then.
And what will you do when Alan comes to get me?
Beg for mercy,
Cry? '
No one is going to find you here, Patricia.
No one.
Stephen! Stephen!
There is another man.
Oh, my darling.
- Where do you think you're going?
- You know where I'm going.
- The work's done.
- Mine isn't.
Well, mine is.
I'm gonna have a few beers.
I suppose you're going to the Three Horseshoes?
Since that's the only public house in this bloody town.
- Yes, that's where I'm going.
- You're gonna see that girl, aren't you?
Supposing I tell Mrs Trefoile?
You're not gonna tell her, are you, Anna?
You love me, don't you?
Harry!
I'm not stopping you.
Go on, go on.
# Here we go round the mulberry bush #
Go on!
I can't run any faster.
Please stop!
You persist in being obstinate, child.
Do you not realise that
I mean you only good?
Well, you shall learn respect, Patricia.
No matter how long it takes.
No matter how long it takes.
Alan.
Please come, Alan.
Please come.
Harry.
Stay close to the house.
I have a job for you.
Come out here, child.
There's something I want you to do.
Give me something to eat then.
- We must feed your spirit first.
Even if my body dies?
- A little fasting will hardly be a cause of death.
That is neither here nor there.
This further wickedness you have confessed.
About my fiancé?
Worries you, doesn't it?
Not at all.
You will write him a note giving some plausible excuse for not meeting him.
You are insane if you think
I'd do such a thing.
You will do it, and at once.
Now, come out!
Go ahead! Shoot!
Then I'll never be redeemed for Stephen, will I?
Then he'll be contaminated for eternity.
Well?
What are you waiting for?
Anna, help Miss Carroll to decide.
Don't!
Will you write the note?
No!
Please, miss, you must write it!
No!
Damn you, no!
Shall I slash your face, child?
Shall I cut it up?
No man will ever have you then.
You will be safe for Stephen.
Please, no.
Please.
Then write the note.
Want the car, do you?
Want to go home, do you?
All right, love.
I'll let you go.
You know what the price is, though, don't you?
You know what it is, all right.
You know the price, all right!
That's naughty!
You thought you'd fooled me, didn't you?
You thought old Harry's drunk.
His brain's all fuddled.
- He'll never know what hit him.
- Don't!
We don't want to wake the old lady.
We don't want to make a lot of noise, do we?
She was trying to escape again, ma'am.
I was just...
Silence!
- Get out of here.
- Yes, ma'am. Right away.
I left the message where you said, ma'am.
- Go downstairs and pack your things!
- Ma'am, I know you think I...
- Don't even speak to me!
- Ma'am, I told you...
You have twenty minutes, not a moment more.
This isn't fair! I don't deserve this kind of treatment. Mrs Trefoile, listen!
- Get your hands off this door!
- We've got to talk about this!
I will have you thrown in jail for this!
Oh?
Oh, will you?
Maybe they'd be interested to hear about your little guest, then.
Now, ma'am,
I didn't mean that.
Slip of the tongue. All I want to do is stay here and serve you.
Get out of here.
- Get out of here!
- Sixteen years, eh?
Sixteen years of working me for pennies, and my wife!
And now you think you'll get rid of us just like that?
Well, I'll tell you this, old woman.
You won't...
All right.
Watch it!
Easy, ma'am. Don't!
I'm going! I'm going!
Be careful, now!
Don't do something you'd regret!
Stephen!
Stephen!
What am I gonna do?!
My God!
She is barmy!
The old hag.
The bloody old hag!
Sixteen years, eh?
Sixteen years!
And I'm chucked out.
He who sheddeth man's blood, so shall his blood be shed.
Stephen!
Why did you ever leave me?
Oh, Stephen, don't look at me!
Don't... look at... me.
Anna.
Anna, I neglected to mention that Harry will not be back for three to four days.
- Three to four days?
- Yes.
I decided that as he had to go to London
I would have him stay on and pick up some things I need.
You'd best do your weekly marketing now, Anna.
I'll take the oatmeal up to Miss Carroll.
Yes, Mrs Trefoile.
Yes.
You may eat now.
I've decided to forgive you.
You may eat.
Are you so frightened of me, child?
Do you not realise that my concern for you is genuine?
That I wish you only God's acceptance.
And my son's.
God's plain food is to your liking now, I see.
Good. Good.
I shall return in half an hour, at which time we shall begin anew.
Where you go, Anna?
- I'm going shopping, dear.
I go?
You buy chocolate?
No. You finish your work, and then you can come in.
Soon?
Yes, as soon as I finish shopping.
- Harry not here?
- No, he's gone to London for a few days.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Joseph!
Would you do a favour for me?
I'd like to send this postcard to a friend.
Give it to the people at the post office.
Oh, and here's some money, Joseph.
For the card.
Pretty.
So!
Within minutes of my forgiving you, of my feeding you, you do this!
This!
You will not learn, will you?
You simply will not learn.
Well, there will be no food today or tomorrow or the day after!
You shall repent!
If I have to starve you into repentance, I shall do so.
It's not my repentance you're concerned with, it's your own revenge.
Revenge is what you're after.
I took Stephen from you.
At least you think I did in that twisted mind of yours.
Do not tax my patience, child.
Well, I have news for you, my dear Mrs Trefoile.
Nobody had to take Stephen from you.
You drove him away.
Oh, God!
I see.
I see exactly why he killed himself.
Exactly why he what?
Exactly why he what?
You didn't know?
I never mentioned it in my letter because I couldn't, but...
Lie. Lie!
It's not a lie.
He killed himself!
He died in a car accident!
Which he caused himself.
Downstairs.
Downstairs!
- Excuse me.
- It's all right.
Anna, my dear. How are you?
You heard my news, of course.
- Two and eight.
- I wonder if you can...
- ...tell me where I can find...
- In a moment, sir.
- Does the missus owe you any money?
- No, she doesn't. How is she?
She's feeling a bit queer, you know?
But she's getting better.
I hadn't seen her so lovely and relaxed since the summer we spent in Bognor.
- You come out...
- I wonder, could you...?
One moment, sir.
Just a moment.
Now, let me see.
You owe me...
And you know what bad arthritis she had. Her hands. But not afterwards.
They were beautiful.
And her face too.
That's it.
- Now, sir.
- I'm trying to find Mrs Trefoile.
I really must get back.
You know, dear, I've got to admit that I was expecting the worst.
But Mummy looked just the picture of health and happiness in her grey dress.
Well, I don't know.
- Mrs Trefoile?
- Yeah.
- I think she lives down by the river.
All right. Thank you very much.
And the coffin looked lovely too.
I'm sorry to trouble you. Could you tell me where Mrs Trefoile lives?
Did you see that woman? She walked away as I was telling her about my poor mother.
- I lost her last week, you know?
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Oh, thank you.
- I wonder...?
It wasn't as bad as I'd expected.
I've never seen her so lovely and relaxed since the summer we spent in Bognor.
There is evil in your blood as there was in his.
You had best consider your repentance, child, lest the same fate come to you.
Now, listen.
"Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee
"and shall pursue thee and overtake thee
"till thou be destroyed..."
"...because thou hearkenest not unto the voice of the Lord thy God,
"to keep his commandments and his statutes
"which he commanded thee."
"And they shall be upon..."
He's here,
Mrs Trefoile.
- What?
- He's here.
I saw him in the shop.
He was asking where your house was.
Alan!
Gag and bind her.
Anna, why are you doing this to me?
- Don't you know that Harry's...?
- Use your scarf.
- Oh, good morning. Mrs Trefoile?
- Yes, I am Mrs Trefoile.
I'm looking for Patricia Carroll.
She was staying here.
She was, but she left.
- You must be...?
- Alan Glentower.
Her fiancé, of course.
Won't you come in,
Mr Glentower?
Thank you.
Patricia left yesterday.
We were so sorry to see her go.
Such a nice girl.
Well, did she say where she was going, Mrs Trefoile?
All I got was this note.
I'm so sorry not to be able to help you further, Mr Glentower.
I'm sure it's just a lovers' quarrel.
And she will turn up again in a few days, asking your forgiveness.
Anna.
You remembered.
Dear Patricia.
She left this behind.
- Perhaps when you see her you could, er...?
- Yes, of course. I will.
Goodbye, Mr Glentower.
And when you do see Patricia, please give her our love.
Thank you, I shall.
Alan!
Filth.
Corrupter.
Stephen.
Yes.
Leave her to me.
Go back to your work.
I've just heard Stephen's voice, and I know what I must do.
I had hoped to cleanse your soul before releasing you.
But now it's too late.
That man will be back here, perhaps this very day.
Therefore you and Stephen must be reunited now.
You must die.
Die, my darling.
He's here.
Waiting for you, child.
Waiting for you.
Last service.
"To thee will I cry,
O Lord, my rock,
"be not silent to me, lest if thou be silent to me
"I become like them that go down into the pit."
I shouldn't worry about her, sir.
She's probably just hiding from you, just to tease you.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
The fellow here says that his girlfriend was visiting Mrs Trefoile's.
Mrs Trefoile's?
Well?
Well, how should I know what goes on at Mrs Trefoile's?
Oh! Come off it, Gloria.
What about that, then?
Well, if you must know, Mr Nosy,
Harry didn't say.
That's all I asked.
Thank you very much, sir.
Your girl giving you trouble?
What?
I said, your girl giving you trouble?
Don't they all?
Yeah, but they're worth it, aren't they?
You're cheeky, you are.
"Let the wicked be ashamed.
"Let them be silent in the grave.
"Let the lying lips be put to silence.
"Which speak grievous things,
"proudly and contemptuously against the righteous."
Pat?
Pat!
No afraid.
No hurt Anna.
Where is she?
- Where is she?
Don't, please!
What's the matter with you?
Where is she?
No hurt Anna.
- What I do with him, Anna?
- I don't know.
Put him in the garage.
- No. Can't. Nice lady car.
- No.
- Might scratch.
- No. No, Harry's got the car in London.
No, car in there this morning.
So you and Stephen must be reunited now.
- Pat! Pat!
- In here.
Oh, my God!
No!
I'll send for a doctor.
And the police.
Keep her in there.
Stephen.
They hurt me.
They hurt me.
Stephen.
Stephen.
They hurt me.
Stephen.
They hurt me.
They hurt me.
Alan?
Don't shout at me.
Why don't you shut up.
We're going home.
SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
Do you read me?
Do you read me?!
Someone, please come in!
My god, my god!
Dr. Weitzberg, contact range officer.
Paging system now secured for emergency use only.
46 hours, 20 minutes,
0 seconds.
Space Operations,
Florida division.
Hold on.
It's the press.
What do we tell them,
Steve?
I'll tell you what to tell 'em.
Tell 'em we sent our second man to the Moon...
And looks like he's not coming back, either.
I'm sorry, Donna...
I shouldn't have said that.
We can release no statement at this time.
Oxygen countdown.
Mr. Curan would like a countdown on the oxygen...
Every 15 seconds.
2 minutes, 30 seconds.
No contact for 9 full hours.
Same thing all over again!
Same thing all over again.
Yet the whole rig is clicking like a dream.
2 minutes, 15 seconds.
We licked every problem...
Put a man on the Moon.
No, we got him off.
Everything worked fine, but Lockhart.
What happened to him?
2 minutes, 0 seconds.
Mr. Curan's desk.
Yes sir, one moment.
The White House.
No, not now.
No.
- 1 minute, 45 seconds.
- Mr. Curan feels certain that there's...
No hope for capt. Lockhart.
Yes sir.
1 minute, 30 seconds.
You alright?
- 1 minute, 15 seconds.
- How's our boss holding up?
Barrenger?
Well, as usual he's not said a word.
I wouldn't get too close to him, if I were you.
I was figuring on giving him a sedative.
60 seconds.
Ready?
Who isn't?
- It isn't over yet.
- Will be in about 60 seconds.
Well...
We've done it your way, twice.
Well, now, we don't pretend to know all the answers.
Apparently, no one does.
For every frontier that's been explored...
- Men have died.
- 45 seconds.
We've only lost 2 men on the strangest frontier of all.
There are millions of people in this world, Dr. Weitzberg.
But there are only 4 men left who can handle the lunar rocket.
We've lost 1/3 of the men we had.
It's like a conveyor tube to oblivion.
- Mr. Barrenger...
- 30 seconds.
The situation that happened to those first 2 men...
Was not only duplicated but widely exaggerated in their training.
Those men did not have a mental crackup.
I'd stake my life on it.
There is no duplicate for the solitude of space!
If those men could've looked in their viewing screen...
And seen 2, 3 or more sister ships alongside...
- 15 seconds.
- Out there... they wouldn't have panicked!
You heard those tapes.
Those men did not panic!
- The next time, we do it my way.
- 10, 9...
- 8, 7, 6...
- The remaining 4 men in mass flight.
- 5, 4...
- Well, then, do it without me.
- 3, 2...
- The mass flight takes place next month.
- We'll talk about it!
- 1, 0.
Oxygen, depleted.
Damn!
I'll see you in Washington... tomorrow.
Steve...
Think he knew about
Don and Mel Lockhart?
I don't know, doc.
If he did, I doubt if it'd make much difference.
Steve, might as well write off 4 more men.
I can't take much more of this, doc.
I wonder how he can justify it?
Our boss is the secretary of Space Operations.
And that cabinet post...
Entitles him to be a very daring man.
Well, we gotta stop him, doc.
Alright, Steve, before you go see him tomorrow, stop by my office.
I don't get it.
I just don't get it!
The pattern is the same as before.
Perfect take-off.
Clear contact all the way.
Perfect landing.
You heard Lockhart when he was on the lunar surface.
Lift-off from the Moon, perfect!
1 hour later, nothing!
And we had him right here, doc!
If he wanted to talk to us he didn't even have to push a lousy button!
Do you read me?
Do you read me?!
Lockhart...
X-20 approaching ionosphere.
Someone, please, come in!
My god, my god!
X-20 to Moon blat.
Do you read me?!
Lockhart?
This is Moon blat.
Curan, Steve Curan.
Come in, X-20.
Steve...
It's coming on again.
My god...
My god!
Kill.
Kill!
Doc... what's wrong with that man?
I don't know, Steve.
This is doc Weitzberg.
How long have you been without oxygen?
15, maybe... 20 minutes.
It's impossible!
Why did you break contact?
Wouldn't let make contact. Please...
Kill...
No, no! Oh, don't...
- Steve...
- I... I can't make it...
Lost control.
Push red...
Push the red...
I can't push that red button, that'll blow him up.
Way off course.
Can't make it.
No, no!
Something... makes my arm move.
Makes me... do things.
Kill, kill!
Doctor, we've got to help him.
I'm 200.000 feet!
Push the red...
Something in me...
Push the red...
Why do you want us to push it?
You can push it, if you want to.
Won't let me.
I can't move my arm!
Kill!
Kill!
165.000.
Push the red...
No more time!
What's his position, where is he?
Inland.
Populated area...
California.
140.000.
Push the red!
Kill!
My god!
My god, Steve, help me!
Help me!
Push the red...
Push it...!
My... my god!
God, Steve, help me!
Help me!
Push the red...
70.000!
Push it!
Well, that's one tape we don't want Donna to transcribe.
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.
How can a man continue to function without oxygen for 20 minutes?
Can't.
Lockhart did.
So, we know...
Something kept him functioning.
A substitute for oxygen?
I don't know, Steve. But ever since we lost Nelson...
An idea's been buzzing around in my brain, like a fly.
A very persistent fly.
After hearing Lockhart the buzzing stopped.
Ya know, I think
I've hit on something.
Wanna hear it out with me?
Go ahead, have at it.
Well, I think what kept
Lockhart going, was life.
An independent vital force...
Something... living.
Well, that's pretty wild, doc.
Well, "living" covers a lot of territory, Steve.
And I don't think
Lockhart was alone...
On his return flight any more than Nelson was.
Oh, now, doc...
I'm not talking about little, green men.
As a matter of fact, I may not talk at all unless I get some encouragement.
Well, what do you need, uh, a drink, maybe?
No... time.
And you're the one that can get
Barrenger to give it to me.
Time? For what?
Time, to prove that this force, this...
"new life" was born on the X-20.
Go ahead.
I need you with me all the way, Steve.
Alright, I'm with you.
What makes life?
A certain, particular combination of molecules...
Or carbon, or silicone, or nitrogen.
Or any number of these things.
A certain temperature.
Mix well, call it what you will, but this mass...
Swirling together in tiny orbits, fuses these things into a...
Precise energy relationship which we call "life."
Ah, now, wait a minute.
What you're saying is that, uh... in space...
Life might mutate, or...
Even fully evolve in a matter of hours, or... even minutes.
What happens when we send a man up there?
You see, see... we don't just send a man in a rocket.
We send up living cells, molecules, bacteria, germs.
We throw in radioactivity.
We introduce all these to cosmic rays.
Do we upset this balance?
Do we start a cycle?
Does a living cell from Earth romance a cosmic ray...
And give birth to an illegitimate monster who makes his nest in...
In Lockhart and Nelson?
It's beginning to add up, isn't it?
Perhaps it was weakening, maybe dying...
Anything evolving so rapidly couldn't live very long.
Well, Steve?
Quite a chunk.
Ah, throw out the logic pills when you swallow it!
This theory can't be measured by anything we already know.
- Sounds like a good case.
- I was hoping you'd say that.
Barrenger won't. He won't go for a theory even if it's true.
Then lie to him!
But buy me the time.
No dancing. No dancing!
Not allowed.
No dancing! No dancing, not allowed.
No rats, not allowed.
Marta, how can you stand those things?
And you are gonna be a nurse, Patsy?!
Well, what are you doing with them?
I picked them up at the
Express Office for grandpa.
They're for the lab at school.
Well, maybe your grandfather's a biology professor...
And your boyfriend's a pre-med student...
But my father's the sheriff and rats and the law don't mix.
Voilà!
No rats.
Hey, you didn't bite!
When I said "boyfriend."
You mean, Paul?
Then he isn't just a mutual interest in hives and chicken pox!
He's very nice.
But how did you hook him?
I know a dozen girls who tried.
The "lone wolf," they call him.
Well, I'm not saying you're not stacked, but he's just not with it.
We're just good friends.
Eat, drink and be merry... for tomorrow you die.
You think I'm kiddin', huh?
Didn't you see that thing last night?
No!
I didn't see anything.
Well, I phoned your father.
Why, there was a fireball in the sky as big as a house.
He didn't see it either.
Well... what do you think it was?
Didn't I tell ya?
Eat, drink and be merry...
Tomorrow you die.
And now, for your local news here at Palms, California.
The traffic commission has decided...
Hi!
- Hi Paul.
- Hi Paul.
Come on, sit down beside me.
Come on, finish your milk, let's get going.
Can we stop by my house?
What for?
It's getting late.
I gotta pick up my bathing suit.
But I told you I'd meet you here, you said you'd have your suit with you!
I forgot it.
I just can't get used to going swimming at Christmas time.
Well, I can tell you one thing...
What's that?
It's for real... you sound like a married couple already.
Come on, finish your milk, let's go.
Alright!
Ok?
I gotta take... drop things at home for grandpa, anyhow.
Ok, let's get a m-move on.
- Bye, Patsy.
- Bye Patsy.
Goodbye, you two lovebirds.
Hey, Paul...
What are they sayin' over at the school about that thing in the sky last night?
Nothin', why? Everybody said it was a meteor.
Hey, come on! Don't tell me you're still scared of them flyin' saucers?
Eat, drink and be merry.
Hi, children.
Hi.
Picked it up for you at the Express Office.
- Thank you, thank you, dear.
- I love you, grandpa. Gotta run!
Hello there, mr. Farnstrom.
I never will understand how you do it.
What's that, sir?
It's 15 minutes past the last bell...
And already, you're off somewhere with my granddaughter.
Well, we have a system, sir.
A secret system.
Secret...
Paul... you keep things too much to yourself.
In science, you must learn that you have to share.
To work together, to accept help.
Not me, professor.
When I make it,
I'll make it on my own.
All the way.
What did I tell you?
Breaking the speed laws!
Going swimming! I'll be back in time to make dinner.
Swimming? Where ??? swimming?
That's our secret, sir.
Our secret place.
You can't object to go swimming, grandpa!
That's ???
You look at me like this,
I can't object to anything this safe.
Bye.
- Bye, bye.
- Love you.
Got your suit?
- Bye!
- Bye.
Bye...
I wonder if they will come to good to science as much as you will.
Are you hurt?
Only my pride!
Poor boy!
The sensitive male ego... so easily wounded.
I think I know now the secret of how to be successful with a woman.
You do? Tell me!
You have to be weak, pathetic.
Then they feel sorry for you.
I think you discovered it.
I know I have.
I always wondered why some spindly, little runts had the girls chasin' after 'em.
Because they felt sorry for 'em.
Of course.
But you were fooling me!
You're not weak.
Darn right.
Now I've got you.
Paul...
I guess I'm not like those other women.
I don't like weak men at all.
Listen... will you once and for all give me a serious answer?
What about?
Are you going home, to Sweden... after the semester's over?
Why not? I only planned to come to California for a year.
To see grandfather... to go to an American school for a while...
Nothing has come up to change my plans.
Whaddya mean?
What about me?
No... I planned there would be a boy, too!
Why you little...!
Don't come any closer!
I've nothing on.
Faker! You haven't had time to undress.
Maybe I didn't...
But I have now!
Ok!
You win.
You know...
I don't think your grandfather approves of me.
You're wrong!
He considers you the best student in his class.
I meant as a member of the family.
What do I have to do, say it in Swedish?
Paul?
What does it mean
I'm "stacked"?
And you're "not with it"?
Stacked?
Where'd you hear that?
Patsy.
This afternoon.
She must've seen you in that suit!
Is something wrong?
Yeah... I'm having non-clinical thoughts.
??? me or not?
How do you say it in Swedish?
Say what?!
Nothin'... let's hit the water.
You know something?
American men marry much too young.
You know something?
It's because of
Swedish girls like you.
But Donna, I've called everywhere and haven't been able to find him!
Didn't he say where he was going?
No... he was quite upset when he left.
He banged on the typewriter for a while... he was in a mood.
I've gotta talk to him right away, it's urgent!
When he acts like this, he wants to be alone.
Well, this is the one time he shouldn't be alone.
Doc, you've got me worried.
I didn't mean to scare you, this is a matter of the gravest importance.
I'll try.
I'll be here until I hear from you.
And Donna... everything alright?
- Yes, doc.
- Good.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
Boy, that water was cold!
Alright... now!
Now what?
The answer.
- Answer?
- That's right.
What answer?
You gonna stay here?
Well, why should I do that?
So I can marry you, stupid!
Marry me? Oh, good!
Paul, Paul!
Take me away, please!
Sure, baby, sure.
Marta...
Let me go back for it, I'll lock it in the trunk of the car.
No, no,
I couldn't stand it!
Let's go right to the sheriff, this is a murder!
- No, not a murder...
- A human hand, not a murder?!
Listen, please... you've just got to trust me.
If it's what I think it is, it could be very important for me, please!
No, no, just take me away from here!
Put your hands up or I'll shoot!
Mrs. Hotchkiss, it's only me...
Paul, what are you doing here? You said you wouldn't be home until late.
Well I just remembered this old pile of papers...
So I thought I'd come back and look something up.
Well, what'd you come in the back door for?
You know how jumpy I am about noises in the house!
I got mr. Hotchkiss' old gun out...
I thought they'd carry a burglar outta here tonight.
I'm sorry, I guess
I just didn't think.
Well, it's a good thing I did...
I was gonna shoot and ask questions later.
This thing's got a hair trigger, too.
Well... as long as it's you, it's ok.
How 'bout some supper?
No thanks, I...
I have some stew leftover from last night.
I could heat it up for ya.
No, I found what I was looking for...
I'm not hungry, really.
I guess I'll just go up to my room, if you don't mind.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Yeah, Steve... it's positive.
There is a reading.
I said there was a positive reading.
This may be all the evidence we need to convince Barrenger.
Oh, really?
Well, snap out of it, would you, Steve?
Don't you understand
I'm giving you the ammun...
It's too late, doc!
- What's that?
- It's my resignation.
You talked to him.
No, not quite, he talked.
He said either get on his wagon or get out. Well, I'm getting out.
Well now, wait a minute.
Tear it up, you don't need it!
This is the gauge I've been telling you about.
It measures the results of cosmic rays.
Or the presence of something associated...
What is the
"something," doc?!
Well, I... I don't know but I did make a very important discovery about Elmer, here.
Has he got it?!
- Very definite...
- Though, how did he get it?
I see... you're not aware of... Elmer.
He's a very distinguished rat!
He was a passenger on our last space probe...
Before we launched our first manned rocket.
In the beginning we thought he was completely unaffected.
But he wasn't?
By no means, you see, he's in that cage alone because I can't trust him...
I don't know when he'll turn on the other rats and kill 'em.
Now, he can unlock an ordinary cage, that's why I had that padlock put on there.
Everyone else around here seems to think that...
What he does is in the range of...
An exceptional rat's capabilities.
But I don't, I think...
Elmer has thoughts.
- Are they human?
- Not necessarily.
Like this "something..."
The same "something" that was in our pilots.
Well, Steve, there's a possibility!
Jackson...
Have you been makin' this noise out here?
Come on, get down.
You know better than that!
What is this doing out here?
What a mess!
That boy!
Said he wasn't hungry and then he comes downstairs...
And knocks these jars off to this shelf!
The last time he'll get around here in my jelly, I'll tell you that!
Cleaning after this kid. God!
That boy!
Wait till I get a hold of him tomorrow.
Why the shower curtain?
Child wakin' me up in the middle of the night...
I have had enough of it!
Empty.
That oughta do it.
Mrs. Hotchkiss!
Mrs. Hotchkiss!
Operator... give me the sheriff, quick!
Sheriff Townsend.
Who?!
Paul?
Paul Lawrence?
Will you stop talking so fast?
I can't understand a word you're saying.
And stop shouting!
Yes?
Mrs. Hotchkiss?
Now, don't touch anything.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Now look, Paul...
I know how you feel, son.
But I'll get there as fast as I can.
Lawrence boy says she's been murdered.
Try and raise the county coroner, Earl.
And call my wife.
Tell her I'm liable to be up all night.
We'll have to make prints of the place.
Sure thing, Ted.
Operator, I'd like to make a long distance call, please.
Never mind, operator.
- Sheriff...
- Paul, where is she?
In her bedroom.
I... I heard a shot.
I ran down from my room,
I found her like this.
No signs of a bullet.
Did you hear anything else, like a door closing or somebody running?
No...
No, nothing.
Looks like she's been strangled.
You can see the marks on her throat... no doubt about it.
Now, tell me boy... did you ever see this gun before?
It belongs to mr. Hotchkiss...
She told me that... it had a hair trigger.
Yes, it probably fired when it fell off the table.
Now I know this is hard on you boy, but...
Anything you can remember will help. Anything at all.
Now, do you recall... did she leave any valuables around the house?
Any sizable amounts of money?
N-n... she never mentioned it to me.
Not that I know.
Well, that isn't the way rumor has it.
That is if you can believe my wife, Edith.
And you can't always do that.
That'll probably be Earl.
I'll get the door.
That should do the trick.
At least that's what my wife
Edith says... usually does for her.
2 of those and a glass of warm milk and she's out like a light.
We'll go over the routine questions in the morning.
Now Paul, just one other thing...
Maybe you don't wanna stay here in the house.
I could drive you over to my house and we'll find you another place tomorrow.
No... no, I'll be alright.
Don't worry about it.
Soap and water'll take that ink off.
You better go upstairs and try and get some sleep.
All through downstairs,
Ben...
Think you got anything?
Well, most of the prints were pretty small...
They seem to match the ones we got off the gun and the flashlight.
A... woman's prints?
Yeah, I think so but I can't tell yet...
There was one that might be interesting...
Got it off a medallion she was wearing.
How soon can we get a report?
Well, I'll tele-photo a set of these to Washington...
And run a make on 'em here, we oughta know something in... 5 or 6 hours.
What about the kid?
Earl, I don't know.
I don't like to guess on a case like this.
I just don't understand why he wants to stay in the house.
I should think he'd want to get as far away from here as possible!
He's a medical student, he's used to being around dead bodies.
Yeah, I suppose.
Now come on... we got a full night's work ahead of us.
- Let's go.
- Yeah, mayb... maybe if we're lucky...
We'll get an hours sleep, huh?
Space medicine...
Dr. Weitzberg...
Weitzberg, Weitzb...
Operator, long distance please.
I'd like to call...
A doctor Max Weitzberg.
In Washington D.C..
No, no operator,
I don't have the number.
Listen, operator... this is an emergency.
No, no, I'll hold on, ok?
No, uh... Weitzberg.
W...
E...
I, T, Z...
B...
E...
R...
G.
No... G.
B, E...
R...
G.
Thank you.
Ring him for me.
Boy, I sure could use a beer.
Who couldn't?
But we can't stop now.
But there's some in the kitchen.
Not me, not here.
Not even for a nice, cool beer?
Listen, whoever got her is probably hundreds of miles away, by now.
Just think of that long, tall, foamy brew.
You could talk a snake out of its skin.
Ok, let's take a look. With my luck, she won't even have any.
Dames likes her always keep beer around.
I told you there'd be beer in the refrigerator.
Holy...! Come here!
What's the matter?
What is it?
I don't know but I'm gettin' outta here!
Wait a minute, he might still be alive.
With a face like that and those marks on his throat?
Listen, buddy, we were supposed to collect the dame and that's all.
This guy's on his own!
He is alive, let's get him outta here.
Get the other stretcher, hurry up!
- Morning, Donna.
- 9 o'clock, right on time.
Did you get any sleep?
A little, not as much as I shoulda.
How do you do when you slip apartment?
I'm alright, Steve.
Really.
There's... this thing's gonna be a bug.
This race from the space...
You know how I feel about
Lockhart, how we all feel.
But it's more than just his loss, could be the loss of the whole human race.
- Doc and I are ???
- I understand, Steve.
What about Barrenger?
Well, ???
No...
Well, he will.
Donna... did you figure out a good excuse for me to get out of the office?
I don't wanna see him just now.
I'll do better than that...
A mr. Meidel from Security called...
Wants you to see him as soon as possible.
It sounded in a very polite way like an order.
Well, I wonder what he wants...
I have no idea.
Well, anyway it's a good excuse for to get out of here, isn't it?
I'll tell you what...
I'm going down to pick up Doc...
Gonna meet the crime committee and see what it takes us to blame.
Goodbye.
This print is quite distinctive.
Notice the scar running directly through the loop...
Makes them impossible to mistake.
Now, the one on the left was tele-photoed last night...
From the sheriff's office at Palms, a small town in California.
So?
We just thought you'd be interested in the fact...
That this print belongs to a man connected with your department.
Who?
An astronaut... by the name of Lockhart.
That's very interesting,
Mr. Meidel...
Would you tell me what Lockhart was doing, in California?
He's suspected of murdering a Mrs. Hotchkiss.
Now, Mr. Curan... would you care to tell us where we can find Lockhart?
Well, to be perfectly honest with you, Mr. Meidel...
I haven't seen Lockhart in over a week.
But if I do get some information
I'll be sure to pass it on to you.
I see...
Well, we'll leave it at that, for the moment.
Now, I don't have to warn you that this is a police matter.
And beholding information could be serious.
Even for a person of your position.
Well, I'm very much aware of that, Mr. Meidel...
And I don't wanna get mixed up in your department along with my troubles, thank you.
Meidel?
Ok, I'll be right there.
If you excuse me, gentlemen...
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Well, we can find the way out, thank you.
Well doc, would you mind telling me what that was all about?
I can't.
I think we should stop it and see Barrenger.
I always thought that fingerprints didn't lie.
Now we know Lockhart wasn't in California.
We don't know anything of that kind, Steve.
I got a call this morning at 4 o'clock from Palms, California.
There was no one on the line.
Of course I don't believe it, who could?!
And don't think I'm gonna let some fantastic story about a ghost...
Fingerprints or no fingerprints,
Stop me from carrying out this project!
- Now, wait a minute, Lee...
- I'm not waiting for anything!
Look, when I took this job...
I was given a goal and a time limit.
And the time limit has just about run out.
Lee, I think we're forgetting the facts of the situation.
I know it may all sound rather trivial, with all of your problems here...
But the fact of the matter remains that a murder has been committed.
And the prime suspect in this case happens to be one of our men!
That's right, Lee.
I gathered from the attitude of Mr. Meidel of Security...
That it won't be long before he applied real pressure, right here.
We may find ourselves right in the middle of an investigation.
However, you do have an alternative, Lee.
When Meidel calls you can gain time by simply stating that...
Lockhart had no authorization to be in California.
And at the present time, you haven't the slightest idea of where he is.
An absolutely true statement.
One, which you can't possibly be criticized for.
Steve and I can fly to Palms and investigate this... "ghost story."
May hold up the project a couple of days...
Practically nothing to lose.
Well, what do you say, Lee?
Alright, you win.
Go on, take off.
Barrenger speaking.
Yes, Mr. Meidel.
Paul?
Sheriff!
You alright?
Sure.
Where have you been?
I... just took a walk.
I... woke up, I... I guess this thing bothered me a little more than I thought. I...
I just took a walk.
But you're filthy, dirty.
You're all sweaty.
You must'a walked awfully hard.
Now, look, Paul, I'm here because an ambulance driver called me.
He told me a strange kind of a story.
Have you got anything to tell me?
No, sir.
Alright, I'll tell you what I want you to do.
I want you to stick close to the house.
I wouldn't go out at all, if I were you.
I don't care what you do, but stick close to the house. You understand?
Why don't you just go ahead and arrest me...
- And get it over with?!
- There's no charge against ya, boy!
Not yet.
I suggest you go up and get some sleep. You had a hard night.
Yes sir.
I'm telling this... really... for you...
Professor Farnstrom... and Marta.
I know you will both realize... that it is the truth.
That I am not out of my mind.
You were right, professor.
I... shouldn't... keep things to myself.
I... I... I tried to be a lone wolf and...
I guess... I wanted all the credit for myself.
Marta and I were swimming...
And up on the sand... we found something quite... interesting.
It was an arm... just an arm.
Had a... strange... covering.
I... guess...
Probably must've been...
From...
A... space suit!
When'd this thing arrive, Earl?
- Why, what is it?
- It's from Washington.
We asked for a confirmation on those fingerprints at the Hotchkiss house.
Well, they say they belong to a guy
I never heard of, Lockhart!
- Who?!
- Melvin Lockhart.
Do you know a Melvin Lockhart?
Anybody in this town by that name? Never heard of one.
It isn't the half of it.
- They're movin' in.
- Who's movin' in?
Washington!
Great Caesar's ghost!
Can you tell me why they want in on a case like this?
A widow lady get's herself killed...
A prime suspect...
The only possible suspect
I've got right here in my hands.
I was gonna make an arrest within a couple hours!
- Kid?
- Most certainly the kid.
- Thank you.
- You know the way he's been acting!
The only one that could possibly have done it.
Now they come up with a man named Lockhart.
And they're taking over.
Earl, I'll tell ya what's happened.
They've got so many fingerprints in Washington they've got 'em all mixed up!
Well, what's the use?
We can't buck 'em, not yet.
They also wanna have us put a guard on the house.
"Nobody gets in."
Want me to go over and sit on the place?
Yeah, you better.
And while you're there... keep an eye on young Lawrence.
I s'pose I shoulda picked him up long before this, but I...
Just didn't want him to have a record until I was 100% sure.
And then after those Washington boys get through fooling around...
I'm afraid he's still gonna be it.
Now, I'd bet $100 on it!
Ok, I'll get right over there.
Right.
- Yes, what can I do for you?
- Afternoon, sheriff, I'm Steve Curan.
This is doc Weitzberg and we're from Washington D.C..
Well, boy! You government boys really work fast!
You got here in a hurry, let me get you some coffee.
- Well, thank you, no...
- No, thanks.
Say, tell me... who's this man, Lockhart?
Wait a minute, let's not get started off on the wrong foot here, sheriff.
Yeah, I know.
You ask the questions, I don't.
Well, you boys are from the Bureau, aren't you?
Well, that's just it, sheriff.
We're from... Space Operations.
Spa... Space Operations?!
Now, wait a minute, boys.
This is Palms, California.
Population: 2.306.
A woman gets knocked off and...
We know all about that, sheriff.
We just want to ask you a few questions, is all.
About this very man, Lockhart.
Has he been seen?
Well, I don't know who you boys are or why you're here.
As far as I'm concerned, you've got no authority at all to ask me questions...
Now, wait a minute, we didn't come out here to get pushed around, sheriff.
Now Steve, just a minute... sheriff?
As a matter of fact, all we want is your permission to go through the house.
Nobody goes through the house. Not till the boys from the Bureau get here.
And I've got an armed guard that says nobody does.
- We just talked to the sheriff...
- Yeah, he called me.
Didn't change his mind, did he?
Nope!
Well, uh... do you mind if we just look around outside?
Nothin' to see, but help yourself.
Do you have any theories?
Yeah, somebody killer her.
That's my theory.
Well, Steve, I guess we might as well be own our way.
Doc, you notice they don't build houses like this, anymore.
Go to rear
No, they... they sure don't, do they?
Well, we'll see you around.
- See you later.
- Yeah.
Whatever we gotta get done, we better get done fast.
That cold fish gonna be around here any second.
Could you distinguish whether it was a man or a woman?
Well, it was a pretty quick glance doc, I'm not sure.
Look, Steve.
"Come back tonight after dark.
The back door will be unlocked."
"I have something important to tell you."
"Be careful of the deputy."
No signature.
Well, I didn't have a date tonight, did you?
Well, it looks like we both have now, doesn't it?
Hey!
Paul?
Paul, are you here?
Paul!
What are you doing here?
Get out.
Paul, are you alright?
I read in the paper about poor Mrs. Hotchkiss.
- Such a terrible thing!
- Never mind.
Get out of here.
Paul...?
That thing on the beach...
Just can't get it out of my mind.
- Have you told anyone about it?
- No.
Get out!
Why are you staying here?
It's no good!
You can come to our house!
Marta, please!
Marta, what are you doin' here?!
Harrison, get her out of this house. Just get her out!
You just get back to your room.
There's no one allowed in here,
Marta, you'll have to leave.
Now wait a minute...
I've a right to see Paul!
I'm a friend of his!
Get her out of this house!
Come on, Marta, out.
Come on!
And don't let her come back!
Mortuary
Hope
I didn't know she had any relatives back East at all!
I know she used to speak of an uncle, but he was in England or some place.
Where'd you say you were from, again?
- Pennsylvania.
- New York.
- He's from New York.
- And he's from Pennsylvania...
We heard about the tragedy and flew out here.
I see... well, uh... here she is.
You can take a look, if you like.
Really looks very well...
Of course, we got the body quite soon after the, uh... crime.
And there weren't any, uh, marks... except the ones on her throat.
You know, sometimes, in cases like this...
Yes, we... we know.
Looks, uh... very well, I think.
Yes, Steve. Yes!
What's he doing?
What is that thing?
That wards off evil spirits.
I see.
There's absolutely no doubt.
Ah... thanks very much.
We're satisfied.
And you're absolutely right, she looks very well.
Hello?
Hello?!
Anybody here?
- Looks like we're alone.
- Yeah...
Wonder where our little friend is?
I think he was watching alright... he'll be down any minute, don't worry.
If we could only turn on a light!
We do and that deputy'd be here in a second.
Yeah, that's right. I gotta keep this flashlight away from the windows, too.
- Steve!
- What?
Give me the light.
Put it on the gauge.
- Yeah...
- What do you see?
Well there's an indication, it's... it's faint, but it's... definite.
Yeah, so I see...
Steve! Keep it over here.
Yeah...
Well, what's it read?
- This is very strange!
- What's that?
Well, there's a very strong reading right here on top of the shelf...
Nothing above, or below.
Well now, that's ridiculous, doc.
No man could get up on that shelf, it would never hold him!
Doesn't have to be a man...
Lockhart's fingerprints... remember?
Yeah...
Well, perhaps we can trace the trail back to where it came from.
- Keep the light on the gauge.
- Alright.
Yes... look!
Stronger.
Look, Steve!
It's right up the wall.
Steve...
It's on the ceiling!
Doc... what man do you happen to know that walks on the ceiling?
Turn off the light!
Alright, let him move first.
Hello?
Hello?!
Come on, say something!
Put the light on him.
Alright! Back into the house...
Come on! Back up.
No...
What are you two doin' back here?
Well, don't bother about us, go after that maniac!
Well now, you must've seen him, he rain right past you!
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Into the house,
I'll call the sheriff.
Look officer, you're wasting time.
Go after that man!
Shut up and get back into the house!
- But I...
- Alright, doc...
Nothing we can do about it right now...
I know I'll never remember this stuff!
Ibsen, O'Niell...
If I just get a D,
I'll be happy!
Do you understand it, Marta?
What's the matter, pal?
You collapsed?
Hey... kid!
That exam's tomorrow and you've got to pass.
You know they expect twice as much from foreign students.
It wasn't the sleep...
It's just that...
I know, you're concerned about Paul.
But he'll be ok.
Patsy...!
I just don't understand it, what's happened to him? It's just terrible!
He screamed at me... why is he staying in that house?
Gee, I don't know...
Pop hasn't said a word about it at home...
Well, there's no use me asking him...
He just won't tell me anything about stuff like that.
They're keeping him a prisoner!
Well, he... may be a suspect.
Paul didn't kill anyone.
That, I'm sure of.
Pop always says you can't be sure what anyone is going to do...
In certain circumstances.
He didn't kill anyone...
I'm sure of that!
I thought it's perhaps time for a little rest and refreshment.
You know studying at such a furious pace without pause can be very exhausting.
I'm afraid that's not the case.
- At least not for me...
- No?
Any case, there are sandwiches and coke...
And I've made quite a tempting, little snack.
You've sold me, professor.
Lead the way.
And you, Marta?
Forgive me, grandpa...
I'm really not hungry.
I haven't been studying and I better start,
I'm afraid, if I don't want to flunk tomorrow.
Well... as you wish.
Patsy and I will have to eat extra portions, then.
And I'm just the girl who can do it, too.
Be back in a few minutes, pal.
Paul!
Could I talk to you for a minute?
Yes, of course.
Come inside.
Paul, I've been so worried!
I know...
Listen.
I'm going away.
Away? When?!
Now.
Just as soon as I get rid of something that...
Must be destroyed.
I just could go without saying goodbye, first.
Paul... what's the matter?
What are you afraid of?
Tell me!
I can't!
Just one thing I wanna tell you...
I didn't kill Mrs. Hotchkiss.
I know that, Paul.
You couldn't have!
But there are people who think I did.
Sheriff Townsend...
What's the difference? If you didn't, everything will be alright.
Grandfather will help you.
He loves you very much, Paul.
Don't touch me.
Listen...
I... I can't explain it, but...
I... I'm all mixed up.
And then, and there's something terrible that's happened to me... and I... I... I... and I...
There's only one person that I could have relied on in this world, and...
I almost killed him a few minutes ago!
What do you mean?
Never mind, it would take too long to explain... I don't have the time, I...
There are times when I'm alright, and then I'm not, and then I'm...
And then when I'm myself and I'm not.
And the periods when I'm myself I...
Are getting shorter, and shorter, to wh...
- Do you understand?!
- No...
Well, then don't try!
I gotta get outta here.
Leave me alone.
No, Paul. I'm not going to let you go.
If you're ill, we'll help you.
You can come and stay with us. And we'll take care of you until you're well.
Listen, Paul...
Do you remember when you asked me that question?
Whether I was going back home after summer was over?
I was only teasing you!
I never meant to go!
I want to stay here.
I want to be here with you!
- I love you, Paul!
- Oh, no, Marta... you don't understand.
I won't... I won't let you run away!
No... no!
No, get away from me!
Paul?
Paul, what's the matter with you?
What is it?
What's the matter with you?!
Marta?
Marta?!
Sheriff, we're sorry.
We shoulda listened to you.
We had no idea the boy was so dangerous.
You 2 should've thought of that when you helped him escape.
I'm bookin' both of ya.
Be reasonable, now.
Look, if he does any harm to that Farnstrom girl I'll show you how unreasonable I can be!
Earl, take the shortcut down Payne Avenue.
My daughter's at the Farnstrom place, too.
Paul...
Paul's face...
It was white.
It was horrible!
There was an arm... lying in the sand.
May I speak with her, professor?
For a moment.
Marta... it was Paul Lawrence, wasn't it?
Paul...?
Paul?
Not... not really Paul.
It was in the sand.
It was an arm.
Lying in the sand...
A human arm.
It was Paul Lawrence, wasn't it?
Hey, his car's gone! It was parked right there at the curb.
Put a call out on the car...
I'll make a double-check inside.
Unit 1 to Control...
Paul?
39-A, code 7...
Spotted him heading down the county dump road but he gave 'em the slip.
Well you stick close to the house, just in case. We'll check with you later.
39-A, clear.
What's this?
Metallic cloth, it looks like.
I've never seen anything like that.
It's the material used for outer space travel.
Lockhart's.
I could bet my life.
I'll circle around this way.
There he is.
Wait a minute, you're not gonna gun him down, are ya?
He's a killer. If he doesn't come quietly, I'll have to shoot him.
But he's just a kid!
Sure, he's just a kid!
I know all about kids like him.
The county jail's full of 'em!
Paul!
Paul, don't do anything foolish!
That's right, Paul...
I don't wanna hurt ya.
Now put that bottle down and come over here quietly.
Come on now, boy...
I wouldn't wanna use this gun!
Now, put the bottle down so we can get back into town!
Paul... listen to me!
You didn't hurt her.
Marta is alright.
Paul... come on, now.
Are you gonna put that bottle down or am I gonna have to take it away from ya?
We better get him to a hospital right away!
Come on.
Doc!
Doc, come over here!
Fingerprints don't lie.
34, clear.
Ok you two, let's go!
Not a trace.
Not a solitary trace.
What have I got, doc?
Nerves, my boy.
Just hypertension, now.
What you had is an entirely different matter.
We'll talk about it when you get well.
What I had?
What happened to it?
Let's just say that life can exist under different temperatures and...
A fever of 104 was enough to finish it off.
Fortunately for you... and for us.
I just talked to Barrenger, he wants to see it immediately.
Good.
I'm glad he does. The sooner we get rid of it, the better.
Marta! Come on in.
Is he alright?
For a little while, I think it'll do him more good than harm. Excuse me.
Are you sure you got that thing fixed so it won't ever get away again?
Don't worry about it, sheriff, it's in a metal box and it's locked.
And in about 2 minutes it's gonna be on an airplane and no one will ever see it again.
Well, that'll be alright with me.
- Goodbye.
- Sheriff.
Come on, tell me.
Did you mean what you said last night about staying here?
Now, don't play games.
I'm too weak.
How can I help myself?
You know women can't resist weak men.
Then you're gonna stay?
Just you wait.
Just wait till
I get out of this bed.
Just you...
Wonder what all of the secrecy's about this time?
There ya go, stickin' your nose into somethin' that's none of your business.
All we're supposed to do is deliver it to the airport.
Yeah, but those people inside got me curious.
You know that fella from Washington, the way he kept looking at it...
Asking me if I was sure it was locked?
I'd give anything to take a look inside.
Not me, I don't care what's in it.
Come on, let's get movin'.
That's your trouble, no curiosity.
You'll never get any place without curiosity.
- You gotta find out about things.
- Yeah?
Well, I like it that way.
What harm will it do to take a look? I've got the key.
It might be dangerous.
What do you think, it's alive?!
You don't see any holes in the box.
You think it'll bite you, or something?
You're always talkin' me into doin' somethin' I don't wanna do.
Have I ever steered you wrong?
The end
-That's enough for tonight.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-How do you feel?
-Tired.
-Margaret, please
 give me a hand.
Your husband must rest now.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[STARTLED GASP]
[RELIEVED EXHALE]
MEDIUM: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
-That's Sanskrit, The black
 sign of death is on this house.
Is on this house.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-A little under the
 weather; aren't you?
Take my advice and
 stop these seances.
You get excited,
 your strength goes.
And that isn't something you can
 afford to squander so lightly.
-I'd ask you to preach, Charles.
They're my only
 interest in life now.
By means of these seances, I can
cross the border-- the border of the spirit world
 to which I belong.
-You'll never get better
 if you go like that.
-Better?
I'll never get better.
All I can hope for
 is a quick death.
-No.
-John!
John!
Are you mad?
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-It's useless.
The poison does its
work too quickly for it to be effective now.
-You must drink this antidote.
Drink it!
Drink it!
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Why?
Why?
-You really had me
 worried that time.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Don't you realize
 you must get well?
You must.
It isn't only your life.
It's your theory, your cure.
That wonderful
inspiration that'll save the lives of
 millions of poor cripples.
Us
-Yes.
I mustn't forget the
 efforts that you've made.
It's a heavy
responsibility for a doctor to give lethal poison
 to a wealthy patient.
-These two poisons
will stimulate your limbs back to life.
I know it.
-Thank you.
Give me faith.
And If you change
your mind, Charles, it would be simple
 to put me away.
Drop more poison, too little
 antidote, and it is natural.
You've a declaration,
signed by me, which limits you to carrying
 out of my preparation.
-All right, John.
That's enough.
You must try to get some rest.
I'm off to the hospital.
See you tonight.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
JOHN: Come here, Catherine.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Get me a glass of gin.
Over there.
It's in the bookshelf.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-More!
-Sir, you really shouldn't.
The doctor will be angry.
-Damn the doctor.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-You are late.
You were an unusually
 long time in the garden.
-I'm sorry, darling.
But don't be cross.
It was such a lovely day.
-Don't say that.
It makes me feel even
 more of a cripple.
-John.
[SIGHS] Why do you
 talk like that?
-Because it's true.
I was watching you down
 there with Charles.
You were so remote,
so far away from me tied to this wheelchair.
And you seemed so happy.
-I, I was happy because
Charles was telling me you were getting better--
 slowly, but surely
-My friend Charles, the
 suave Dr. Livingstone.
He is the exemplary,
 faithful friend.
-If you're jealous of him,
 why don't you send him away?
He isn't the only
 doctor in Scotland.
-I know.
But he is the only
one who has dared to practice my cure on me.
-Then what are we arguing about?
Doesn't my being near
you, my loving you, help or mean anything
 to you at all?
-I am sorry.
My apologies.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
MARGARET: You may go, Catherine.
I'll get it.
You know I want to be the one
 who takes care of my husband.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[DRINK BEING POURED]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-There you are.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Is that all?
-That's all.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-John!
No!
No!
-You ought to have let me do it.
I'm just a living corpse.
-No, John, no.
Don't talk like that.
-One day you might
regret that you stopped me from killing myself.
-Who gave you the revolver?
Was it Catherine?
-No.
It's been hidden in here
 for years, among the books.
-May I help, Ma'am?
-Thank you.
I'll manage alone.
[JOHN MAKES SMALL SOUNDS OF PAIN
 AS HE'S HELPED TO BED]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Charles.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Charles.
Stop.
Stop.
I can't go on living
 this part anymore.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't go on being the devoted
 nurse and the loving wife.
You've got to put an
 end to it, Charles.
I can't even bear to touch him.
I hate him.
Help me.
Help me.
I beg you to put an
 end to it, Charles.
-It's impossible.
You know that as well as I do.
-I thought you loved me.
I thought you would do
 anything in the world for me.
-Anything?
Yes.
Not that.
-But don't you see
 he's getting better?
-No, he's not.
The cure is a stimulant.
It gives him occasional
shots of vitality, but it doesn't alter the
 nature of his disease.
Believe me, darling.
We won't have to
 wait much longer.
-You're lying.
You said yourself
a cripple can go on living for years and years.
You are lying; aren't you?
I can't stand it, I tell you.
I can't stand it, Charles.
I can't.
You can just abandon
 it all and leave it.
You can leave him.
You can leave me.
You can do anything you like.
-I'll never leave you.
-Then free me.
Charles, if you don't
 do it, I'm going to.
Do you hear?
-No.
No, Margaret.
-Charles.
I will.
I swear it.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[TURNS ON MUSIC BOX]
-We heard it at a
 restaurant in Copenhagen.
It was the first time
 I met you, remember?
So long ago.
Nearly 13 years.
The waiter insisted
on presenting us with a bottle of Dutch gin.
I was a real man then, a
 doctor building a reputation.
Yes.
And you?
A beautiful, penniless
young thing without a care in the world.
[MUSIC BOX PLAYING]
How happy we were then.
As happy as two
 children on holiday.
-Don't move, darling,
 or I'll cut you.
[MUSIC BOX PLAYING]
-Pour me some gin.
-You know you shouldn't.
-It brings back memories.
[MUSIC BOX PLAYING]
-You have some too.
[MUSIC BOX PLAYING]
Good evening, Canon Owens.
You look the picture of health.
-Good evening Mr. Hitchcock.
You too, my friend, are looking
 very well, I'm happy to say.
-Yes.
I owe it all to my
dear, devoted wife and our good Dr. Livingstone.
To the Dutch gin
and to the memories evoked by a Viennese waltz.
-Then since you are in such
good spirits, Dr. Hitchcock, perhaps you will have patience
 enough to listen to me.
Oh no.
Thank you.
I never drink.
What I have to say is
 not altogether pleasant.
-Out with it, Canon Owens.
Have you come to tell me that
the people are still gossiping about the devilish
rites being conducted in the house of evil,
 crippled Dr. Hitchcock?
CANON OWENS: Please,
 Dr. Hitchcock.
You shouldn't treat
 this matter so lightly.
What I mean to say is,
the townspeople are saying that your experiments
are directly connected to black magic.
And you ought to
remember that not very long ago they were victims.
And they are also
saying, Dr. Hitchcock, that the devil has
 set his mark on you.
-So you also believe
that I'm actually in league with the devil.
Is that right, Canon Owens?
-The devil is more real a
person than our modern world would have it, Dr. Hitchcock.
Come.
Can't you forget
 these experiments?
I appeal to you as
 a-- a man of science.
Surely you should be the first
 one to despise superstition.
-It is not superstition, Canon.
I assure you.
It is all basically scientific.
-Well then, I warn
 you, Dr. Hitchcock.
You are playing with forces
 which are best left alone.
I entreat you.
Confine yourself to
your scientific studies like these here.
-Don't touch that.
That vial holds curare, one
 of the deadliest poisons.
If even the slightest
scratch on your hand were to be touched
by it, you might have ended your days in
 a wheelchair like me.
Usually curare kills, but
 in small doses it paralyzes.
CANON OWENS: Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-I love you.
Never forget that.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Just a minute, Charles.
The queen moves to H7.
-Checkmate.
-Exactly.
-If it weren't for the doctor
 with the injection hypodermic,
I'd ask for my revenge.
-I'm afraid, Dr. Hitchcock,
it's getting late, and I think we ought to go now.
Or else we'll have all the
people in the town saying that the chief constable
is neglecting his duties and the criminal activity
 is increasing in the county.
And we wouldn't want that, now.
Would we?
-Don't forget that.
-No, no, no.
No fear of that.
I'll see you tomorrow.
JOHN: -Tomorrow?
Who knows if I'll see tomorrow.
When I was in Africa, a
witch doctor said to me, the day will surely come
when the bright sun will no longer shine over the forest.
-Your medicine seems to
 put you in a bad mood.
Why don't you give it up?
Don't believe in
 medicine myself.
As far as I'm concerned, I think
 it's an awful lot of nonsense.
Not to me.
I think that scientists
should believe in their power to
 heal even cripples.
CHIEF CONSTABLE:
 Perhaps you're right.
Good night.
-Good night, Dr. Hitchcock.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Be quick.
Be quick.
Give me the antidote.
What's the matter, Charles?
Give me the antidote.
Please.
Please, Charles.
Please.
I'm suffocating.
[BELL TOLLS SIX TIMES]
-It's been an hour since
 I gave the injection
It should be over now.
[FOOTSTEPS]
CATHERINE: If you are
waiting for Dr. Hitchcock, he's not coming.
It's my fault.
I'm sorry.
He told me to say he was
 dining in his room tonight.
[FOOTSTEPS]
[BELL RINGING]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-He's dead.
He's been dead for
 more than an hour.
CANON OWENS: The Lord is my
 shepherd, I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie
 down in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside
 the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me in the
paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
Yea, though I walk through the
 valley of the shadow of death,
I shall fear no evil.
For thy rod and thy
 staff, they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table
before me in the presence of mine enemies.
Thou annointest
 my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely, goodness and
mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.
And I will dwell in the
 house of the Lord forever.
Amen.

[DOG BARKING THEN HOWLING]
-Oh, Charles.
Please, not now.
-It's all right now.
We've nothing more to fear.
It's all over.

I wish he'd go away.
-Margaret, what are
 you thinking of?
You mustn't lose control.

Margaret.
Margaret.
Margaret.
MARGARET: [SOBBING]
-Madam apologizes.
She'll be down in a--
-How is she?
-She's not too well, sir.
It's changed.
I wouldn't have thought
 her so sensitive.
The master's death
 has upset her.
And if I may take
 the liberty, sir?
I don't think you should
 leave the house now.
Madam needs your care.
Please, Dr. Livingstone.
Stay with her.
She's taking it hard.
-Yes, I'll stay.
-Good morning, Canon Owens.
Good morning, Dr. Fisher.
-The last time I
saw our poor friend was to say the night
 before his demise.
He seemed strangely excited.
Before our usual chess
game, he insisted on dictating his last testament.
Dowbridge.
November 4, 1910.
I, John Hitchcock,
sound of mind, am dictating this-- my
last will and testament-- to my solicitor, Mr. Albert
Fisher of Fisher, Markley, and MacNab of 10 High
 Street, Dowbridge.
Item one.
I bequeath my house
with all it contains and the land on which it stands
to my wife, Margaret Hitchcock nee Whiteman as a
token of gratitude for her affectionate assistance.
On condition that she keep in
 her employment my governess,
Catherine Wood, to
 the end of her days.
Item two.
2/3 of the contents of my
safe, bond shares, currency and jewels-- which is to say all
that I have been able to save during my existence--
should be given to the home for orphan children
 directed by Canon Owens.
In the recognition of the
several instances in which his words as a
friend and clergyman have brought balm
 to my troubled soul.
The remaining third
of my belongings shall become the
property of my wife, who shall use them in any
 way she thinks fit.
Item three.
All the books and documents
 pertaining to the studies
I have conducted
during my lifetime will be denoted to the Institute
 of Psychic Research in London.
That's all.
Now Mrs. Hitchcock,
if you would kindly proceed to open the
 safe in my presence.
-The key is in the drawer
 of that desk, Mr. Fisher.
You'll find it
 yourself by opening it.
-There is no key
 here, Mrs. Hitchcock.
-Strange.
Catherine, do you know
 where the key might be?
-No, ma'am.
But I remember the master
 always kept it in that drawer.
-There's no hurry,
 Mrs. Hitchcock.
You can take your time.
And if you think it
necessary, Canon Owens and I can have the safe sealed.
-Oh, good heavens.
I wouldn't dream of it.
FISHER: In that case, Mrs.
Hitchcock, will ya kindly inform me as soon
 as ya find the key?
Should it really
be lost, we shall have to apply to the
magistrate's for authority to have the safe forced.
-Well?
-Nothing.
-And yet it must be.
It's bound to be somewhere.
-Damn!
[MUSIC BOX BEGINS PLAYING]
-No!
-What is it, Catherine?
-There's something I've
 got to tell you, ma'am.
The master sometimes kept the
 key to the safe on his person.
I saw him myself put the
key in his vest pocket, a few days before he died.
-Well, in that case it
 must still be in his coat.
-Oh yes, ma'am.
But it's the coat
 he was buried in.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Well, you see?
John has the last laugh.
-Bet 150,000 pounds
in shares and jewels in that awful safe of John's?
60% of which is to go
into the greedy hands of dear, Christian-minded,
 charitable Canon Owens.
It's so funny when you think
what we've risked together for the benefit of those poor
 orphans and dear Canon Owens.
[LAUGHS] So terrible.
Don't you think it's funny?
-Stop it, Margaret Margaret!
Margaret!
Oh, the key's buried with him.
Buried with him.
Buried.
-We can't force the safe.
They'd find out.
-Of course, not.
-All we need is the key.
Charles, I want that key.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[CRICKETS CHIRPING AND MUSIC

 of the injections.
They hasten decay.

Margaret.
We've got it.
That's, That's all that matters.
Let's open it.

CATHERINE: Ma'am!
-Darling, you must stop her.
Don't let her come in.
Go on.
CATHERINE: Ma'am!
Ma'am, excuse me.
I was wondering--
[EXCLAMATION OF PAIN FROM
 MARGARET]
-Oh!
Did you hurt yourself, ma'am?
How terrible.
What happened?
-No, it's nothing.
What do you want?
-Is Dr. Livingstone upstairs?
-Yes.
Why?
-They're asking for
 him at the hospital.
It's very urgent.
-All right.
I'll tell him.
[EXCLAMATION OF PAIN]
-Can I help you, ma'am?
-It's all right, Catherine.
-Let me help you.
-No.
Charles, they want
 you at the hospital.
What's happened?
-There's nothing there.
CHARLES: I tell you
 there's nothing there.
No money.
No-- just papers and documents.
[MARGARET SCREAMS AND SOBS]
-Margaret.
Stop it.
Margaret.
Margaret.
Don't shout.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Calm yourself.
Stop it.
Come on.
Get up.
It'll be all right.
We'll find it sooner or later.
Sit down.

 key into the lake.

I'm frightened.
[MUSIC PLAYING]

-Excuse me, ma'am.
Canon Owens to see you.
He is waiting for
 you downstairs.
-What's he want?
CATHERINE: I don't know.
He didn't tell me.
[FOOTSTEPS]
-Good morning, Mrs. Hitchcock.
-Good morning.
Please sit down.
-Oh, excuse me.
Uh, we missed you in church
 today, Mrs. Hitchcock.
Surely you haven't forgotten.
-What?
-The memorial service
 for your husband.
You know, we live in
 a small community.
And uh--
-Will you come to the
 point, Canon Owens?
-Well, Mrs. Hitchcock,
Dr. Livingstone's presence in this house was necessary
during your husband's life, in view of the
 state of his health.
But now-- you will understand--
 a young, widowed lady.
Alone in her deceased husband's
house-- a man, even though he is a trusted friend
 of the family.
-You mean the town
 would have it that Dr.
Livingstone is my lover?
-Oh, dear me, Mrs. Hitchcock.
The thought never
 entered my mind.
But I thought it my duty
 to warn you that gossip--
-Let them gossip, Canon Owens.
I have other things on my mind.
-I only meant well,
 Mrs. Hitchcock.
-No doubt you did.
Good day.
-Good day.
-Have you gone crazy?
-What?
-First you forget
to attend a service in your husband's memory.
Then the Canon comes,
 and you put his back up.
You practically insulted him.
-Charles, you seem to forget
that it was he who insulted me by suggesting you were my lover.
-The fact is it's
 the truth, my dear.
And we don't want people
 to find out the truth.
Do we?
-I'm sorry, Charles.
But what could I do?
-You should have
 thought about it first.
We're playing a
 dangerous game, Margaret.
You know as well as I do what
one more stupid move like that will bring us.
-Darling, please don't
 turn against me now.
-I'm not turning against you.
If I would do that, I'd have
done it a long time ago-- long before you dragged
 me down to this.
-I dragged you?
It was you who killed him.
-Don't you ever say that again.
Never.
-Charles, you're hurting me.
Stop it.
-You wanted him dead.
You pushed me into this.
Margaret, forget it.
My nerves must be going too.
It's jarring coming back
 like this to these walls.
He's much more between us
 now than he ever was alive.
He's always here.
I always feel him
 just over my shoulder.
Sometimes I turn to try
to catch him face to face, and he's not there.
No one is.
Hmmm.
Oh, well.
We're in this together.
That's all that matters.
-I'm going to go upstairs
 and try to get some sleep.
-Remember, we must
 be very careful now.
We're being watched.
You, uh, you better
go up and visit your husband's grave
 this afternoon.
Take him some
flowers, and be sure that someone sees you do it.
-Just as you say, Charles.
-I'm only saying it
 for our own good.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[MUSIC FROM MUSIC BOX CAN BE

-You really should try
 and eat something, ma'am.
It's not good for
you to go on day after day without
 having any food.
-I don't want it.
[MUSIC FROM MUSIC BOX CAN BE

-Shall I stay up and wait
'til Doctor Livingstone comes, ma'am?
Do you want me to wait for
 Dr. Livingstone, ma'am?
-Don't you hear it?
Don't you hear it?
-Hear what, ma'am?
-You know perfectly well what.
It's coming from upstairs.
-I can't hear anything, ma'am.

You're lying to me.

-Why are you spying

-Somebody got to
 it before you did.
-Who is doing these tricks?
Who is it?
Who is it?
-That's not hard to understand.
Who lives in this house
 besides you and me?
It's very clear.
Isn't it?
-No.
-There's no one else; is there?
-Charles.
-Margaret, I'm leaving here.
-Why?
-Because I finally
realized that everything we hoped for is being
 gradually destroyed.
Even if we found that money
and could get away from here, we'd be too late.
We would only go on
 destroying each other.
I'm sorry, but--
-No.
What's done cannot
be undone, you said so yourself
 not very long ago.
-That's right.
But I can get out before
more evil is done-- before we complete
 destroy each other.
-Why these silly qualms of
 conscience all of a sudden?
-I feel like a man
 waking from a dream.
And I realize now, for the very
 first time, what we've done.
-Charles, please don't go away.
-I'll do what I have
 to do, Margaret.
-Charles, everything I've done
has been to have you with me forever.
That's all I've ever
 wanted out of life.
Don't leave me alone, Charles.
-We are both alone
 now, Margaret.
Perhaps forever.
Don't you understand that?
Being together would be
 like living in a nightmare.
-But I love you, Charles.
I can't live without you.
-It's too late for
 love and feeling.
You once loved your
 husband; didn't you?
Well, that's all over
 and done with now.
But you'll forget me, just like
 you've forgotten the other.
-But that's not true!
I love you!
No, Charles!
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-And I didn't believe her.
I didn't believe my own eyes.
-Margaret, I didn't
 know about this.
-Yes.
-You don't think that I--
-What should I think?
What should I think, Charles?
It's all quite clear now.
Ever since the very
 first thing when
I left you alone with the safe.
-Are you crazy?
I'm not a thief.
-Oh, yes, you are a thief!
You've deceived me!
-What are you talking about?
-You're a liar!
-I've got to know what
 you're talking about!
I swear I didn't take them!
Margaret!
-No!
Leave me alone!
-Stop it!
No, Margaret!
Stop it, will you?
You crazy?
I swear I didn't take them.
I didn't know they
 were in my bag.
So now you'll be convinced
 it's best we split up.

-Margaret, you're trembling.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
-Perhaps you weren't
 expecting me.
You should be accustomed
 to my materializing by now.
MARGARET: Oh.
-But this time it's really me,
 Margaret-- alive and kicking.
[MARGARET IS BREATHING HEAVILY]
-Just feel how
 strong my grip is.
But I won't kill you.
No.
It would be too easy,
my dear, for you to escape your
 punishment that way.
When you were in the
tomb, you cut yourself when you opened the
 jewel case; didn't you?
Well, I smeared the
 hasp with poison.
Curare.
It paralyzes, you know.
And now you'll be tied to
 that wheelchair like I was.
And I'll be far away
enjoying my wealth, which you and that
poor idiot Charles were looking for so desperately.
[CHUCKLES] I had
 it all the time.
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
You were wrong about Charles.
He didn't take the jewels.
Catherine put them in his bag.
[CHUCKLES] He really loved you.
I planned it all.
It was Catherine who loaded the
revolver with blank cartridges when you shot at my "ghost."
But when you so kindly
fainted, she shot a few bullets into the wall, and you
 went crazy with fear.
You know, it all
 started when I realized
I was really getting better.
I wanted to bring
you the good news, and I found you in the arms
 of Charles, on the floor.
You decided to get rid of me.
But I replaced the curare
with a liquid which produced apparent death, putting
 another corpse in my coffin.
Causing you to look
 feverishly for the estate.
Persecuting you
 incessantly, night and day.
[RINGS BELL] Appearing to you
as a psychic materialization was all very simple.
Wasn't it, Catherine?
Have you prepared everything
 for our departure, Catherine?
-Yes, sir.
-Perfect.
Thank you for all
 you've done for me.
You've been a great help.
-Thank you.
-Go now.
[FIVE GUNSHOTS]
-Oh.
Oh.
-I had to do it.
There will be no witnesses.
Margaret, one last
 favor, darling.
Your fingerprints on the
 revolver butt, thank you.
Now you'll be accused
 of her death too.
[LAUGHS] Poor, Catherine.
When she called
the police for me, she didn't realize she was
asking them to come here to investigate-- not
 Charles' death-- but her own.
[LAUGHS] Amusing; isn't it?
Soon, my darling, you will
 be completely paralyzed.
[SOUND OF CLOCK TICKING]
 The police.
They've arrived.
I shall have to leave you,
 my dear, before I expected.
I apologize.
I apologize profoundly.
Ah.
My faithful Dutch friend, gin.
I see that you're
 cultivating my habits.
You've poured yourself a glass.
Your good health.
Or rather, your ill health.
And to our memories
 of Copenhagen.
[CHUCKLES] Ah.
Pity you didn't know there was
 a secret passage in this room.
We would have met, quickly.
[LAUGHS]
[MARGARET BEGINS TO LAUGH]
-[GASPS] I'm suffocating.
[GASPS FOR BREATH SEVERAL TIMES]
-That bottle there,
 on the table.
Give me that bottle.
It's the antidote.
We can still save ourselves.
Help me.
Margaret, please.
Give me the-- the
 antidote, Margaret.
-Oh.
There.
-We'll save ourselves.
We'll save ourselves.
Give it to me.
-There.
-Ah!

EYE OF THE DEVIL
From the novel "Day of the Arrow" by Philip Loraine
Come along and sit down.
I am sorry, Monsieur le Marquis.
Along to bed, darling.
Darling?
Philippe?
Darling, what is it?
Is something wrong?
I have to go home, Catherine.
Home?
Oh, you mean to Bellenac?
Why?
Grandec was just here.
The vineyards are failing again.
Oh darling, I am sorry.
How long would we going to be there?
I mean... we must make plans about the children's school and everything.
Catherine, I'd rather you didn't come.
During a vineyard failure it's not very pleasant.
They resent outsiders.
Outsiders?
Please, try to understand...
Please!
Well..
How long will you be away?
I don't know.
Well, if it's for a very long, darling, please, will you send for us?
We'll see.
Oh, I love you, my Catherine.
I love you very much.
Maman, Jacques's spitting those things at me again.
Jacques, you'd better not let papa catch you with that awful thing.
You don't understand, mama.
You see, Antoinette is Marie Antoinette, actually, and I am the spirit of free France.
It's my duty to capture her and bring her back to justice.
Well, so... your papa will free France you, if you don't stop teasing your sister.
Maman, why don't you and papa put Jacques in the army?
Morning, children.
- Good morning, papa.
- Good morning, papa.
Papa, please will you take me to Bellenac with you today?
Papa, I want to know if I'm going to Bellenac today with you.
I'll sleep in a car and I promise
I won't ask you any silly questions.
Darling...
Philippe?
Jacques is talking to you.
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.
I'm terribly sorry.
I haven't quite shaken the cobwebs yet.
Well, I want to know if I'm going to Bellenac with you today.
I'll sing those songs you like to hear while you drive.
I love your songs and the trip will be quite unbearable without them, but not today.
Maybe next time.
Monsieur le Marquis has arrived, sir.
He has come back.
Put another log on the fire.
I'm cold.
I always seem to be cold these days.
Make me some more tea.
But first lock the door in case my nephew comes up.
Not that I think he will.
I would think madame would be anxious to see Monsieur le Marquis.
In my own good time, Marianne.
Has the priest come?
Yes, madame.
Pere Dominique.
God be with you.
Well, Rennard?
I... I wish to say we are all proud you've return, Monsieur le Marquis.
Did you think I would not?
Some thought you would not.
I knew that you would.
How about you, Father?
I never doubt in the path you have chosen.
What makes you think I've chosen it?
You came back, didn't you?
I think you have chosen it,
Philippe, my son.
Haven't you?
I didn't know you'd ever been to Bellenac.
Oh yes, half a dozen times or so, when Philippe and I were at school together.
We went there just after we were married.
I thought it was the most frightening place.
Almost as all we were back in the Middle Ages.
You know, I'm worried about Philippe.
He's never been like this before.
I remember even as a child
Bellenac seemed to have some terrible fascination for him.
As though he would obsessed with finding some diabolical secret of the place.
Jacques, darling!
What are you doing down here?
Mama...
I want my motorcar.
But darling, you ought to be in bed.
I want my motorcar.
So I can go and see papa.
- Is he...?
- Yes.
But he's never done that before.
Now talk to him quite naturally, and you won't wake him up.
There's your motorcar, darling.
That's it.
Now, we'll going to see papa in your motorcar, first thing in the morning.
Now let's go upstairs, get back into bed.
She's come with the children.
- Welcome to Bellenac, Madame la Marquise.
- Thank you, Rennard.
Madame.
- I hope you had a pleasant journey.
- Yes, very pleasant, thank you.
Come, Jacques.
Where is papa?
Where is Monsieur le Marquis?
I'm sorry madame, he's gone to Lapiton.
Your telegram was late in arriving.
Did he say what time he would be back?
He said he will not return until late tonight, madame.
Christian de Caray is a very wicked boy.
And his sister Odile is no better.
But... why should he do such a thing?
You may ask Philippe to speak to him about it.
Yes, I certainly shall.
Now, if you will excuse me,
I have a terrible headache.
Marianne, would you fetch me an aspirin, please?
I'm sorry that you're feeling unwell.
I shall try not to trouble you any more.
Don't let her in here again.
This time I can't...
I can't be involved.
Rennard.
Madame?
Didn't Monsieur le Marquis just get back?
No, madame.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, madame.
Because I saw two men riding to the courtyard.
Who were they?
I'm sorry madame,
I neither saw nor heard anyone.
- Thank you, Rennard.
- Good night, madame.
Take your children. Drive out to the valley.
Never turn back.
Jacques, why aren't you sleep, darling?
What's the matter, darling?
I do love it here.
Oh mama, please let us stay here.
Don't let as leave here.
Oh please, let us stay here forever.
Now darling, you must go to sleep.
It's very very late.
You will be a good boy, eh?
Darling, I am sorry.
Rennard said your telegram arrived just after I left this morning.
When did you get back?
Oh, just a while ago.
I've forgotten how long that ride takes in the dark.
I had dninner with old Conier and his wife.
They send their best regards to you.
Oh darling, I'm sorry
I didn't came up right away, but I had one or two things in the office to attempt to.
I saw some lights on, in a tower room.
I went to see who is there, and...
Philippe... it really was horrible.
Those de Caray children were carrying in a dead dove.
And there were men in robes...
Darling, the people of Bellenac have always been steeped in strange rituals.
I never tried to understand them.
Neither should you.
You broght the children of course.
Yes.
Yes, of course I did.
You know... every time we've been apart,
I'm surprised all over again how beautiful you are.
- How are the children?
- Oh, very fine.
They've missed you. And so have I.
I had Jean-Claude in for drinks the other night.
Did you?
He's very worried about you.
Can the vineyards be saved?
In time... maybe.
Well, there's... not really very much you can do about, it is there?
Catherine... my family has lived here in Bellenac for over a thousand years.
Somehow here the years seem to shrink.
I find myself thinking in... generations and centuries.
What are you seeking, Philippe?
Am I seeking... or am I being sought?
Oh darling...
- I just want to help you.
-You can't help me.
I have great responsibilities here, and they can't be shared.
But Philippe, what are those responsibilities?
Do the people here think that you're some kind of a magician...?
Or... a god?
Catherine, you shouldn't have come here.
I asked you not to.
I want you to go back to Paris.
Take the children and leave first thing in the morning.
But darling, the children are unhappy without you, and so am I.
Even now you... you don't seem to need me anynmore.
Of course I need you.
I just want you to leave here.
Yes, but why, Phillipe?
Alright.
Stay then, if you must.
But please, don't ever question me about this anymore.
- She kept asking me questions.
- What questions?
She implied I was keeping things from her.
- Did you enlighten her?
- Don't be a fool, Philippe!
I'd rather died than speak of that to anyone.
I think I'll go away from here.
As you wish. You know these rooms are always kept ready for you.
This is no place for a woman, it never has been.
I sometimes believe you're all mad.
All the men of this family, from the very beginning.
She loves you.
She's a fine girl, a beautiful girl.
Take her away from here, Philippe.
Take her away and the children.
Put a thousand miles between you and this place.
Hello.
Hello.
What's your name?
I'm Odile.
Odile de Caray.
And you're Jacques, aren't you?
And this is your sister Antoinette.
How did you know?
We met when you were both very young.
What's this?
Tell me, do you believe in magic?
Do you, Jacques?
Do you?
In magic?
Oh yes, I do.
Do you see that toad, there, on the lily pad?
Sitting very still.
All by itself.
I can see it, but you have to look.
Exactly where I tell you.
No, Jacques.
Not there.
Just over here...
All by itself...
Do you see it now?
Yes, yes! I see it!
Well, shall we change that toad...
- ...into a dove?
- Yes!
Alright.
There!
- Look! Look!
- Where? Where is it?
There, there it is! Can't you see?
Flying up in the sky!
Look! I can still see it!
You're being silly.
Now come along inside children.
It's starting to rain.
If it does, the rain will not last, madame.
Mama, she changed the toad into a dove!
Why won't it last, Odile?
These are not life-giving clouds, madame.
Now, just exactly what are you doing here, Odile?
My brother and I come here often.
Well, you may tell your brother he is no longer welcome here.
I will not stand for him killing the doves.
Madame la Marquise.
- Hello, Jacques.
- Hello.
- Antoinette?
- Hello.
You like it here, Jacques?
Oh yes, I love it here.
I want to live here for always.
What lovely children you have.
I hope you overheard, what I said just now.
I will not permit your killing the doves on this property.
Killing doves?
Madame must surely have misunderstood.
My sister has just created a dove.
A white dove from a toad.
Mama, it stoped raining.
She said it would.
I warn you, Christian... if there's any more foolishness with that bow and arrow,
I shall report it to the police.
Come along, children, come along.
Run and wash your hands,
I'll be along in a moment.
Philippe, you must do something about Odile and Christian de Caray, immediately.
They are devils.
What did they do?
Well, that boy Christian, that bow and arrow of his is a lethal weapon.
He's just managed to frighten me half to death!
The day I arrived he shot a dove right in front of me.
And just now he was actually aiming at me.
- He must have been joking.
- Oh my God, darling, joke or not, the thing might have slipped, it might have hit me or one of the children.
He wouldn't have slip, he's far too good for that.
Philippe, that is not the point.
The point is the boy is dangerous and he shouldn't be allowed here.
Catherine, his family have had a hounting rights here at Bellenac for centuries.
I show you he's quite harmless.
Both of them are.
Strange? Yes, but harmless.
I'm sorry darling, but I don't believe that.
- Believe it, Catherine.
- I just told you I don't.
Believe it...
Believe it...
Believe it... or leave here.
What?
Philippe!
But what does it mean?
What does it mean, Father?
Has the world reached such a past, we must ask what it means, when a man chooses to pray?
Father, you know as well as I do, that Philippe is not a religious man.
My poor child, you're upset.
Bellenac has this effect on you.
I know that.
Perhaps you should go away, generate for a little while.
Yes, but why should I?
I only want to help him.
But you're in no position to help him, my child.
Your husband is one of the few really great landowners left in Europe.
For three years now the vines are born no fruit.
If it were not for Philippe's personal generosity, half of the families in his demain would have gone hungry.
Isn't it just possible in these circumstances of the men might to turn to Almighty God?
Yes. Yes, I suppose it is... but... what was that ceremony, up there, in the tower? 
That... that wasn't part of any church ritual.
You should not concern yourself, my child, with things you know nothing about.
The people of Bellenac are deeply rooted in the past.
Their traditions of worship are... ancient.
Some of these traditions may seem strange to an outsider, but I think you agree they should be respected.
Oh, it isn't that I lack respect, Father.
It's just that I...
I want to understand.
Understanding is not always necessary.
Indeed sometimes it is not possible.
Now go to bed, my child.
You're tired.
Jacques!
Odile!
- Mother is angry.
- I think we should go down.
Must you always do as your mother says?
Mama saw you on the parapet, so she'll tell papa.
Now you know perfectly well you're not suppose to be up here!
Now go downstairs at once!
- But mama, we only play...
- Don't argue with me, Jacques!
Go downstairs immediately, both of you!
How could you let Jacques do that?
How could you!
He might have been killed.
You know as well as they do, that they are not allowed to play up here.
Christian and I were playing on the roof at home.
And here we may were far younger than they are.
Because nobody cared enough to stop you.
But I do care about my children, and I don't want you seeing them any more.
But don't you think that kind of ultimatum should come from Philippe?
Well... has Philippe said nothing to you?
About Christian and the children?
Did he say he will?
Did he lie to you?
Oh, but you must be used to that by now.
Men always lie.
Personally...
I have no use for them.
Except for Christian.
But then he's different.
Catherine...?
What's the matter?
Is the sun bothering you?
Are you alright?
Would you like to go in?
You're getting very tired.
Would you like to go in?
Your eyes are heavy.
Very heavy.
You must go to sleep.
You must go to sleep, Catherine.
To sleep...
Careful Catherine, you might fall.
Take my hand.
Odile...
Help me.
I am helping you, Catherine.
I am helping you.
Just a few more steps... then you'll be save.
And you can hold my hand.
Take it, Catherine.
Take it!
Odile!
Poor Philippe.
You're mad.
Quite quite mad.
Then all the men in your family are all mad.
But of course you know that, don't you?
I told you to frighten her, not to kill her.
My child, where is your conscience?
What a hypocrites you are.
What stupid hypocrites!
I don't... I just don't know what happened. I...
One moment I was talking to her and the next moment I was lying on the roof.
Get killed her of what she tried to do to you.
Yes, I can believe it.
In fact, it's about the only thing I can believe.
What exactly does that mean?
Oh no... it's just... in spite of everything I'm... I'm sure... that you personally... don't wish me any harm.
But darling, of course
I don't wish you any harm.
I love you, you know that.
Yes, I do know it.
That's exactly what keeps me here, Philippe.
Is it Jean-Claude?
Yes, how did you know?
I telephoned him.
I wish you hadn't done that.
I don't want anyone staying here at the moment.
Oh, he's not going to stay, darling.
He is just on his way to Spain.
Well I can't see him.
You got to explain him
I had to go to the vineyards.
You say Philippe is in some kind of torment.
But then he won't confide in you nor shed any light on what has been happening here.
These are Philippe's ancestors, aren't they?
Who is that?
Oh, that? I think is...
Yes, that is Edouard,
Edouard de Montfaucon,
Philippe's grandfather.
Philippe's grandfather, eh?
Philippe's father, as I remember it, was drown, wasn't he?
Yes.
It looks almost medieval.
12 men dancing round the 13th.
Those men in robes... they yook like the men I saw in the tower.
In the library I seem to remember some kind of family history.
Records documentation.
Yes. Yes, I think there is.
In fact, I'm sure there is.
Do you realize how many of Philippe's ancestors have died under, what the police will call: mysterious circumstances?
Here is a list of 22 Montfaucons,
22 heads of the family, who have died in veriest extraordinary ways.
Gillaume, 1262, murdered on the way back from the crusades.
Jehan, the same in the year 1310.
He was only 19.
Gerard, 1437, killed while out hunting.
Jules, 1509, the same, and so on, and so on.
Catherine, you're in danger.
Your son maybe too.
- No, you're trying to frighten me.
- Yes, I am.
Have you forgotten already how that girl tried to kill you?
No, but... that I can think of at the moment is Philippe and what's happening to him.
I shouldn't have dragged you into all of this.
I'm sorry.
- I'm not leaving here...
- No, no, please, it would only...
I can manage. But... thank you.
Odile, what are you doing here?
I'm waiting for Christian.
Odile, where is the grave of Edouard de Montfaucon?
It's in the forest, madame.
Where in the forest?
Madame should take the lower road, to cross the white bridge, take the path to the right.
The path is steep, very steep.
It leads directly to the place.
Thank you, Odile.
- I beat you. I said I would?
- I let you beat me.
You always get so bad temper, when you loose.
I saw madame riding into the woods.
Where was she going?
To La Bosse, Monsieur le Marquis.
Madame wishes to see the grave in the forest.
"I would be saved, and I would save.
"The Twelve dance on high.
"Whoso danceth not, knoweth not what cometh to pass.
No!
I thought...
I thought I heard voices.
You were just regaining consciousness.
There was nobody here.
You knew, didn't you?
I knew from certain things
I was told what might happen.
I warned you you should be in great danger, if...
You were lucky.
It's only a surface cut.
You won't even have a scar.
Now you must rest.
This will help you.
Dr. Monnet prescribed it.
Remember dr. Monnet?
He says that you'll be perfecly alright.
You're just suffering from shock.
- Philippe...
- Yes, my darling?
- Please, don't leave me.
- You must rest now.
Sleep.
Oh, Philippe...
Come back...
Please, come back...
I can help you.
No one can help me.
Not even you.
You don't understand.
You could never understand.
"Whoso danceth not,
"knoweth not what cometh to pass.
It's in the painting, isn't it?
Is that it?
Is that it, Philippe?
"Whoso danceth not,
"knoweth not...
Good bye, Catherine.
Good bye, my darling.
Open this door!
Open it!
Philippe!
Philippe, where are you?
Oh, please, somebody open this door!
Double two.
You got to go back to the bottom.
No! It's not fair!
Come on young lady, ride back to the bottom.
- Your throw, Jacques.
- Estelle, see it!
Yes! See it, Estelle!
See it!
Estelle, see it! You must see it!
Nine!
It's not fair. You won again.
One, two, three.
Estelle, help me!
Help me!
What is that, auntie?
It was only a reflection from a piece of glass.
It's your go, auntie.
Shall I go for you?
It's there! See it! Its there!
I thrown three!
You've got to go back too.
Go on, auntie, go back.
Marianne?
- Marianne, where are you?
- Yes, madame?
I want you to go down to my niece's bedroom.
Mama is ill.
We're not allowed to go and see her yet.
That's true, madame.
I don't thing Monsieur le Marquis would like...
Monsieur le Marquis doesn't pay your wages, I do.
Go down there please, at once.
Dr. Monnet is here.
Of course I didn't come.
For the very good reason they never call me.
But they told me, that you'd come...
Is it one of old Mother Blossac's concoctions?
Yes, what is it?
Belladonna.
My friends who practice witchcraft call it by other names.
Generates a potent narcotic.
And it can induce sleep, as in your case.
And occasionally it's used for move states of trance.
Trance?
Visionaries, religious seekers have been using it since the Middle Ages.
Supposedly it induces states of religious ecstasy, a spiritual purgative, one might call it.
The user is cleansed, prepared.
But... prepared for what?
Who knows? Ehm, glorious pilgrimage of the soul, I suppose.
Now, you come along back to bed.
That's it.
Doctor, what's happening down in the square?
The flags and the bells...
It's "Les Treize Jours", madame.
The thirteen days.
Is there something special about it?
Does it have some symbolic meaning?
It's just a fair, madame.
A simple country fair.
No, it's more than that.
I attend of the bodily needs of these people, not the spiritual ones.
Now, come along back to bed and promise me you'll take no more this silly witch's brew.
Now I'll stop by.
See you again tomorrow.
Philippe!
Welcome friends and neighbourd to Bellenac.
And to "Les Treize Jours".
Let the earth bring forth vines, yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth.
And the word was God.
No!
Oh, Estelle, please, you must tell me now.
What was it, that you swore to keep to yourself?
I swore on the Bible.
But surely God will forgive me.
Surely he will.
I think of your little Jacques...
He won't have to do that terrible thing Alain did.
You... You mean...
Destroy himself.
Then your brother... wasn't drown by accident.
He killed himself... to escape from Bellenac.
From whatever it is, that's happening here now.
He escaped, yes.
But it was neither an accident nor a suicide.
It was a plan.
He is still alive.
He's in the tower.
Above here.
Estelle?
Where is Catherine?
Leave me alone, Philippe.
You told her.
Yes.
Philippe...
Even before you were born
I prayed that you would...
Shirk my responsibilities, as Alain did?
Alain is your father.
Yes, but is not one of the men of this family.
Jacques is.
Philippe, I beg you.
If it is now beyond your power to prevent this terrible thing, at least spare your own son.
- Marianne, bring my son to me.
- No.
Bring him!
Madame?
Fetch him, Marianne.
Monsieur! Monsieur Alain!
Oh please, please!
Your sister Estelle sent me.
Oh, Philippe, Philippe...
Isn't there anything anyone could do to?
It was you!
In the hall that night.
What has my sister told you?
Only that you are alive.
And that if anyone can help Phillipe, it is you.
Sometimes I believe that on that afternoon in Antibes
I really did drown.
Where did you go?
Oh, for years I wandered, and in the end I came back... to this shame.
Do you know the meaning of the words: "Les Treize Jours"?
There is here not an amusing play on one word.
"Les Jours" meaning "The Days" easily becomes "Les Joueurs", meaning "The Players", meaning...
Dancers.
The thirteen dancers.
The Twelve dance on high.
Amen-amen.
Amen.
The Twelve who were dancing are the twelve of apostles and the thirteenth in the midst is...
Christ.
Long before Christianity there existed religions in which twelve men danced.
The twelve... and the one.
The Whole on high hath part in our dancing.
Amen.
Amen.
When you entered the cathedral of Bellenac, you have the impression that you are listening to an ordinary mass.
Nearly all round you there are people who hear.
But you do not hear, because it is the Black Mass.
And when once a year on that square you watch the dance of the twelve men, there are people who see in the midst of the twelve... thirteenth: living god.
Those people are not Christians and never have been.
And Pere Dominique?
He is a part of it.
No, more than the part.
He's all of it.
Pere Dominique is a pagan.
Bellenac is a fortress of heresy.
But what of Philippe?
Men like Philippe, Pere Dominique, of course they realize that what these people believing is heresy, and they realize too what heresy is capable of.
The people of Bellenac issue a command, that has to be obeyed.
But... a command that do what?
The earth has to have sacrifice.
There has to be blood.
I would save and I would be saved.
But someone must stop them!
They must be stopped!
There is nothing we could be done.
When he embraced his son...
The Kiss of Peace.
That meant that Philippe was elected to die.
I will go to the police.
Inspector!
I was just on my way...
Why are you here?
I thought you might want to see me.
Then you know.
We have all been worried about you.
Worried about... me? No.
You don't understand.
My husband is...
You need rest, madame.
It was a bad fall.
Apparently the horse kicked her head.
Serious complications can arise, madame, if you don't rest after that kind of an accident.
- Let me take you to your room.
- You stay away from me.
Philippe wishes to see you.
Because of the children.
The children...
Jacques... Where is Jacques?
The children are perfectly safe.
They're locked in the great-aunt's appartment, just as you must be locked in here.
Philippe, you can't do this!
In a sense it is already done.
But it's meaningless.
Darling, you can't do it.
Catherine, you can't stop this.
Neither you, nor anyone else.
And... when it's all over... don't try to make a fuss, because no one will believe you.
No one will come forward to support what you say.
No one ever has.
You must be mad.
You must all be mad!
All of you!
You're dying for nothing.
I'm dying for what I believe.
For me people and for my faith.
You believe in all this primitive nonsense?
Yes, I do.
Philippe, you are my husband.
I am your wife.
We have two lovely children.
And once we were also happy, but here at Bellenac you get sick.
Philippe, listen to me, please...
Please, listen to me.
Leave here now, with me and with the children.
That's all you have to do.
Just walk away from this... this stupidity. This... this evil.
Alain, your father, was right.
He told me once: drive out of this valley and never come back.
Oh Philippe, my dearest, let's do that!
Let's do that now!
Catherine...
It's our belief in something, that makes that thing
- for a moment, or forever - divine.
It's time, my son.
Alain! Alain! You must help me!
You must help me!
Alain, in a few moments in a very few moments
Philippe will be dead.
Philippe, who you once loved so much, and who I shall love always will be murdered.
Sadistically murdered in cold blood.
Alain, you're alive because you couldn't believe in all this vile hypocrisy, this... this heathen mumbo-jumbo, these sadists...
And because you weren't ill, in a way that Philippe is ill...
Alain, I'm a prisoner here!
But you can help me.
You told me you came back secretly.
Tell me how?
While there is still time.
You can't be a part of your own son's murder!
Oh, Alain!
We must save him!
You and I, we must save him!
We've got to, we've got to!
Help me, Alain!
Help me!
Oh no!
"And asked, if it did not strike him this surprising
"that the fatal shot had been fired with, of all things, a bow and arrow,
"the Coroner replied, that he was not in the least surprised.
"He understood from those who knew about such things,
"that this ancient weapon
"had recently had something of a vogue among the young."
People don't want to hear the truth, Catherine.
I shall never come here again.
Not again.
I want to seat by the window.
Oh, my watch!
I forgot my watch!
I left it in my bedroom!
Did you think I'd forgotten?
No, my son.
I knew you would come.
Did you find it?
Yes. subtitles - Orion1

Want to see it again little girl? It shouldn't frighten you.
Sorry. Nothing until matinée tomorrow.
Lady, would you mind taking off your hat?
Excuse me.
Show'em how.
Alright. Thank you folks. Thank you very much.
One final request, alright?
I've written a Letter to Daddy!
Alright, alright. I've Written a Letter to Daddy!
I've written a letter to daddy!
His address is heaven above.
I've written dear daddy we miss you,
And wish you were with us to love,
Instead of a stamp I put kisses,
The postman says that's best to do
I've written this letter to Daddy,
Saying I love you.
I've written a letter to Daddy saying I love you.
Thank you very much.
Well what do we have here?
All for you.
Jane, isn't that a beautiful doll?
Thank you, young man. That's a gorgeous doll.
Folks, have you ever seen such a lovely doll?
Alright children, thank you.
Now folks, please, please, don't forget...
There's a genuine Baby Jane doll waiting for each and everyone of you...
...out in the foyer. All you have to do is go out there and collect her...
And kids, remember, you can tell your moms that every one of these dolls is an exact replica of your own Baby Jane Hudson. Thank you.
Baby Jane dolls. Only three and a quarter...
Very beautiful. Natural hair. Very beautiful. Only 3.25.
I won't. I don't want to go back to the hotel.
I don't want to take a nap and you can't make me!
Now Jane, don't act up. You've got to take your nap, you know that.
No I don't and I'm not going to!
Now Jane, you don't want all these nice friends to think you're a bad little girl, do you?
I don't care! I want an ice cream.
Now Jane I told you...
I want it! I make the money so I can have what I want!
Jane, that's enough.
Leave me alone. I need an ice cream!
If you need an ice cream, I guess you'd better have some.
I mean, it's pretty hot and all. But remember, this is the last time this week.
Alright daddy. Blanche wants some too. We gotta have some ice cream for Blanche.
I don't want anything.
What do you think you're trying to do?
Sure is a hot day today...
You're the lucky one, Blanche, really you are.
Some day it's going to be you who'll get all the attention.
And when that happens I...
I want you to try to be kinder to Jane and your father than they are to you now.
Do you know what I mean?
I hope you'll try and remember that.
I won't forget. You bet I won't forget!
The Excelsior Agency sent you...
Uh-hum. Is there any chance for me?
That depends if Mr Webber likes you.
What type does he like?
Oh, not a personality...
I'll catch on... Watch me.
Oh boy, oh boy...
My money and I should make a picture like that.
Good morning. Mr Webber. I'm Miss Brent.
Oh, yes. Won't you come a little closer, please?
She's got a Southern accent like I got a Southern accent.
Yeah. I know it's 11 o'clock. I'll be there when I get there.
Yes, what is it?
Mr Gravner is here for you.
Gravner? I'll come out.
I'll be right back Miss Brent.
Help yourself to some cigarettes. Make yourself at home.
Then the job is mine?
Didn't you ask?
Oh boy, oh boy...
Cut it!
What do you think Bernard ?
What's thinking have to do with it?
She stinks, doesn't she?
The end is pretty good. Maybe we should have seen it too.
Oh please.
Are you gonna want that picture again today, Mr. Colden?
I don't think anybody's ever gonna want that picture again.
When the old man hired the Hudson sisters how come he had to hire the back end of the act too?
Boy, what a no talent broad that Baby Jane is!
Why can't she stay sober?
Jane's got her pride. She's a very sensitive girl.
Listen. Your very sensitive girl doesn't do away with 6 cases of scotch and slug two studio cops, not to mention one or two other less savory items of publicity. before we got that so-called epic in the can.
Anyway, you don't have to talk to Jane.
If Blanche won't let us out of that clause in the contract which says that we have to make a picture with Baby Jane for every picture that we make with Blanche then Baby Jane's contract won't be any problem.
That's what we pay lawyers for.
Possibly. Somehow I can't see Blanche doing that.
You know, I don't get it. Blanche Hudson is the biggest thing in movies today she can write her own ticket. She's got script approval... she's got more money than she knows what to do with...
Hi...
You know, she just bought that tremendous place Valentino used to have.
It's going to take a year to fix up the place before they move in.
Well I guess they can manage to struggle on where they are now.
But my point is she ought to have sense enough to know that she can't make a star out of Baby Jane again.
Blanche doesn't have any illusions like that.
She's a very fine person, Van.
She's never going to forget those early years. what her sister did for her. She told me that herself.
I tell you she's not doing Baby Jane any favor.
Some day sooner or later that girl's gonna end up in a home.
You're going to be at the party at The Globe tonight, aren't you?
Did you ever try refusing one of Blanche's invitations?
Do me a favor, Marty. You talk to Blanche.
Try to make her understand
I'll do my best.
Thanks.
Remind me to send you one of those Baby Jane dolls for Christmas.
I've got mine for this year.
I don't get it Marty.
Why do they make monsters like this for?
For Blanche Hudson!
That's our problem.
You go to bed.
Hi mom.
Hi dear.
Isn't she great?
Sorry to break in on this fine old Blanche Hudson movie folks,
But you'll be glad I did when you see what I have right here for that favorite pooch of yours.
And Illiad means quality.
So, when your dog says "Whoof, whoof", feed him Illiad.
Oh shut up!
Oh my goodness, I remember the first time I saw that picture.
I thought it was just wonderful.
When was that?
Let me see now. As I recall, your father took me to see it at the old Majestic.
Before we were married.
She must be 150 by now...
As a matter of fact, I think Blanche Hudson is just a few years older than I am.
Really?
Yes, dear. Really.
Well how come we never see her around?
We've been living next door to them for 6 months now.
And the only one I ever see is that fat sister slouching around.
Don't they ever have company?
I mean, it must be awful.
You know, Julie says that sister is kind of peculiar.
Did you ever notice that?
No, I never have.
Well, that's what Julie told me.
She said that she was supposed to be responsible for the accident that crippled her sister Blanche.
Well that all happened a very long time ago, dear.
And maybe you shouldn't pay too much attention to everything that Julie tells you
There's too many people in this town with nothing else to do but talk.
Maybe so. But Julie's folks have lived here a long time so I guess she should know.
Turn up the volume. We're missing the picture.
Oh, he should have held that shot longer...
I told him that when we were rehearsing and also in the shot.
He wouldn't listen.
Still a pretty good picture.
Enjoying yourself?
Jane, what are you doing? I was...
I was watching!
Then you're an idiot.
I won't have you speak to me like that.
Ah, poor thing.
Poor baby. Quiet darling.
Good morning Miss Hudson. I hope I'm not intruding.
I just couldn't resist cutting these flowers for your sister after seeing her show yesterday.
You must be very proud of her new success.
On television, I mean.
Yeah.
I can't tell you how nice it is to be seeing all her old pictures like this.
I'll tell her you said so.
You know, my daughter and I would just love to meet her one day.
Perhaps she could...
Mrs. Bates my sister doesn't ever go out.
She's not fit to receive visitors.
Oh, I am sorry to hear that.
I had no idea that...
Well, I hope she likes the flowers.
Thanks.
You miserable bastard...
Oh Jane, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to ring for my breakfast.
I was just wondering who all those people were at the back door.
It wasn't anything.
Just that nosy Mrs Bates going on about your picture last night.
Oh, really ? Did she like it ?
Oh, really ? Did she like it ?
She liked it.
I remember when it first came out it had a tremendous reception.
The critics described it as brilliant.
Remember what year you made that picture ?
But of course.
You must too, 1934. Right after I did "Moonglow".
I made a picture that year too.
Oh, yes. It was that comedy directed by Lloyd, wasn't it ?
No, it wasn't. It was a love story.
"The Longest Night". Marty MacDonald said it was the best thing I ever did.
They never even released it in the United States.
Feldon was very upset. He told me the company had a very bad year and
No they didn't. They had a great year. They didn't want to show my film.
They were too busy giving a big build up to that crap you were turning out.
I'll clean the cage.
Oh, that would be Elvira.
Yeah.
Come in Elvira.
How are you today ?
Fine.
Oh, you've seen Jane.
Uh-huh.
I don't think she´s feeling very well today.
Did you speak to that Dr. Shelby about Miss Jane like you said ?
No, I haven't yet. It's rather difficult.
I don't want to upset her again if I can help it.
She'll be upset anyway, Miss Blanche.
And the longer you leave it, the worse it's gonna be.
I know.
But I was just hoping it wouldn't be necessary.
I think she seems much better lately.
It's none of my business, but she's been drinking again. You know that, don't you ?
No, I hadn't noticed.
Oh, I don't think it does her any real harm.
I think I understand her.
Oh, you do ? Then you ought to take a look at this.
What are these ?
I guess it's what you call fan mail.
Oh, how kind people are.
You'd better look at them and then you can tell whether or not you've seen them before.
Did you read them ?
No.
But they've been opened.
That's right. They all have.
And there's one in here marked "personal".
The other night my husband and I watched that lovely old movie of yours,
"Last Honeymoon".
I remember saying to my husband at the time that seeing you again was just like meeting an old friend.
Oh, that's charming. It's really charming.
The point is you never saw them before, did you ?
No.
I thought that.
I'm sorry. I thought you ought to know.
But I don't understand.
Where did they come from ? Where did you find them ?
In the trash barrel, that's where.
They're from that television station that's been running your old movies, aren't they ?
Yes.
You mean Jane...
Who else ?
She must have thought they were advertisements.
Then why would she open the one marked "personal" ?
And what about this. You might as well see this too.
Writing those dirty words.
I can't even remember the last time I saw words like that written down.
Why would she do a thing like this ?
You know what makes her do things like this.
She's sick and she's not getting any better.
In fact, the last month she's been getting a lot worse.
If you don't believe me, why are you selling this house and planning to move out ?
You said this last month she's been a lot worse.
Do you think she knows ?
About selling the house ?
How could she ? You don't have anything in writing.
We're sisters, Elvira. We know each other very well.
I just think she's jealous because of those old movies of yours they're showing on television this week.
Anyway, in 6 weeks you'll have to hand over the house and she'll have to know.
How do I tell her ? How ?
Well if you just speak to that Dr. Shelby. Maybe he could tell her.
No.
No, it ought to be me.
I can't let a stranger tell her.
But he's a doctor, Miss Blanche. And she's a sick woman.
Elvira, you didn't know her when she was a little child.
When she was young...
I've seen those pictures she keeps.
Oh, no. It wasn't that she was just pretty.
She was different. She was so alive.
I was cleaning the cage.
The bird got out.
But where is it now ?
It flew out the window.
You let that bird out on purpose Miss Jane.
I just told you. I was cleaning the cage and the bird flew out the window.
I'm sorry.
She did that on purpose. Believe me, she did it on purpose.
Never mind. Maybe he'll come back.
Elvira. You won't change your mind will you ?
I mean, about coming to live with me ?
You know I don't go back on my word Miss Blanche.
But you've got to make up your mind about finding somewhere for Miss Jane.
Where they can look after her properly.
I have. I have made up my mind.
I'm going to call um Mr Shelby today.
I know, Miss Blanche.
It's just that I have to be sure that I'm doing the right thing for her.
Hello, this is Johnson's ?
I want to order some liquors. It's Jane Hudson.
What do you mean you can't fill any more orders for me ?
My sister did ?
Well...
Wait a minute, I'll put her on.
Blanche. Would you speak to this man from Johnson's ?
Hello. Who is this please ?
Oh, yes Mr Carson.
Yes, this is Blanche Hudson. What seems to be the trouble ?
I'm afraid there's been some misunderstanding.
I certainly didn't mean to suggest that you shouldn't fill any oders for her.
After all we do pay our bills, don't we ?
Yes, fine.
Would you, please ?
I'll put her on.
Ok then ?
Good. I'd like to order 6 bottles of scotch and 3 bottles of gin.
The same brands.
And as soon as possible.
I just told Miss Blanche.
I'm going downtown to see a man about jury duty.
I'll be back tomorrow.
Hello.
Hello.
I've written a letter to daddy...
His address is heaven above.
I've written dear daddy we miss you...
And wish you were with us to love...
Instead of a stamp I put kisses...
The postman said...
The postman says that's best to do
I've written a letter to daddy...
Saying I love you.
Now when I'm very good and do as I am told...
I'm mama's little angel and papa says I'm good as gold...
But when I'm very bad and answer back and sass...
Then I'm mama's little devil and papa says I've got the brass.
Now I wish that you would tell me
'Cause I'm much too young to know...
Alright Blanche, I heard you. Miss big, fat movie star!
Miss rotten stinkin' actress!
Press a button, ring a bell and you think the whole damn world comes running, don't you ?
Lunch, Miss Hudson! Why certainly, Miss Hudson!
I'm sure we can find something appropriate for you Miss Hudson!
Oh, you brought my lunch. A bit early, isn't it ?
What were you ringing for ?
I wanted to tell you something's wrong with the telephone.
Mabe it's been left off the hook downstairs.
Is that so ?
Who did you want to call, Blanche ?
Well, actually, I wanted to call Bert Henley.
Oh, our business manager.
Yes.
There's something I've been meaning to discuss with you.
Well ?
You see, the point is Bert thinks we'll probably have to sell the house.
Why should we have to sell the house, Blanche ?
Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
Our financial position is such that we just can't afford to...
We got plenty of money invested, I know.
Yes, that's quite true. But... some of those investments aren't paying much.
When did our business manager tell you all this ?
Early last week, I think.
He didn't call here last week. I know that too.
We didn't actually speak on the telepone.
He wrote me a letter.
He didn't write you any letter either.
There hasn't been a letter from his office...
Jane there has...
You're a liar. You're just a liar. You always were.
Bert never wrote any letter or called you on the phone telling you to sell the house.
You called him 4 weeks ago and told him to sell it.
I did nothing of the sort.
Don't you think I know everything that goes on in this house ?
You've been spying on me.
What do you think ?
You are disgusting.
After all I've done for you you spy on me. When all I'm trying to do is help.
Who are you trying to help Blanche ?
What are you planning to do with me when you sell the house ?
What did you have in mind ? Some nice little place where they could look after me ?
Better not tire yourself out using the phone anymore.
If there are any calls, I'll take them downstairs.
Eat your lunch. It'll get cold.
Jane. Please wait.
Jane.
Jane I want to talk to you. Please.
Jane I want to talk t...
Telephone, mother.
Alright dear.
I need your help...
I called this morning and placed an ad.
Did we give you a reference number ?
Oh yeah.
Alright, here it is.
Do you want to check the copy ?
That's fine.
Do you want this in the personal columns or in the want ads ?
I always think the personal column is nicer, don't you ?
Yeah...
An eight-line ad... that'll be $6.30.
And uh... who's placing this ad ?
We have to know.
I am.
Yes, I know. But who for ?
You see, when you're placing an advertisement for someone to do a job for you we have to have your name for the record.
My name is Jane Hudson.
Maybe you remember me. I'm Baby Jane Hudson.
Oh... sure...
Thank you. This will be in the paper tomorrow.
Who the hell was Baby Jane Hudson ?
Please call Dr Shelby at 0L61656 and ask him to come here to the house immediately.
Please... under... no circumstances... let... my sister see... the... contents of... this note.
Blanche Hudson.
Oh, Miss Hudson. How nice to see you.
I was just going to call on you.
Why ?
I just wanted to ask you about the flowers I brought over for your sister.
I'm afraid they don't last very long this time of the year and perhaps you'd like some more.
Well you saved yourself the trouble.
Oh. it is no trouble at all. I'd been cutting some, that's why I came over.
I always think it's so nice to have flowers in the house...
Mrs Bates...
I guess if my sister needed flowers we could afford to buy them.
What's the matter mother ? You look as if you'd been in a fight.
I'm not sure that I haven't been.
Jane Hudson makes me so mad I could kill her.
Gee! That's a good idea. What'll we use ?
Did you have a nice drive ?
What are you talking about ?
Nothing dear. I ...
So long since you were out of the house that I thought you had gone out for a drive or something.
I was thinking. It's ever so long since we had a talk... you know, real talk. About the future and everything.
Jane. I didn't want you to be worried about the house.
Even if I have to sell it we will still be together.
Blanche, you're not going to sell this house.
Daddy bought this house and he bought it for me.
You don't think I remember that, do you ?
You're wrong, Jane.
You've forgotten. I bought this house for the two of us when I signed my first contract.
You don't think I remember anything, do you ?
There are a whole lot of things I remember.
You never paid for this house.
Baby Jane Hudson made the money that paid for this house, that's who.
You don't know what you're saying.
Blanche, you aren't ever going to sell this house.
And you aren't ever going to leave it.
...either!
Jane.
Jane.
Do you remember when I first came back after the accident ?
You promised you wouldn't ever talk about that again.
I know I did.
But I'm still in this chair.
After all those years I'm still in this chair.
Doesn't that give you some kind of responsibility ?
Jane, I'm just trying to explain how things really are.
You wouldn't be able to do these awful things to me if I weren't still in this chair.
But you are, Blanche. You are in that chair.
And tell me. What are these awful things I'm supposed to be doing to you ?
I mean... you wouldn't have to work so hard.
And I was thinking maybe... maybe Elvira could come in more often.
Maybe she could even live with us.
We don't need Elvira.
But you get so tired. You...
There's so much to do and you're not well.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I should get a check-up or something.
That would be wonderful.
Perhaps we could find a really good doctor.
Yeah, we could get hold of that nice Dr. Shelby, couldn't we ?
Yeah... let's see.
What's his number again ?
And under no circumstances tell my sister the contents of this note...
It's not me that needs a doctor, Blanche.
Hello lovey!
Don't stop for me.
What did the doctor say ?
He says it's no use my going back to work for another 6 months.
Didn't he even give you anything new to take ?
He always says it's arthritis.
And the only thing for me to do is not to cry and work until it clears up.
Did he suggest what we're going to do for money in the meantime ?
No dear. Oh, but he's ever such a nice man.
Now laddy, never you mind anyway
You know, we still got a bit of savings.
You're my little worrier.
Oh, that's nice. You've found something, have you ?
You don't have to get excited if you haven't even seen what it is yet.
No dear, but it's a possibility, isn't it ?
I mean, there aren't that many jobs that would be suitable for someone with your qualifications.
What qualifications ?
Well... you know... serious music.
This sounds like just the ticket, doesn't it ?
You're gonna call ?
Call who ?
These people.
Might as well.
Now ?
Well it wouldn't be a lot of bloody use calling next week, would it ?
No dear.
Mom, I'll tell you what. Why don't you call for me ?
Tell them you're my secretary or something.
Alright dear, I'll do that.
Now listen. I won't let on who I am. I'll just tell them I'm Mr Flagg's secratary
SECRETARY.
Secretary...
What do you know?
I do believe your old mom would be a jolly good secretary at that.
Don't you think ?
Hello.
This is Jane Hudson.
Oh, about the ad.
Who is this ?
This is Mr Flagg's secretary.
Oh, his secretary.
Yes, Mr Flagg is very interested and he'd like to know if he could have an appointment.
I think you'll find he's very well qualified.
Yes, I'd be glad to give Mr Flagg an appointment.
Well now, let me see, umm...
How about 4 this afternoon ?
I think that would be fine.
I'll be expecting him then.
Thanks.
It's all fixed lovey. Oh, your old mama's man has everything, hasn't she ?
Oh, shut up !
What do you want this time ?
Who was on the telephone ?
None of your business. What were you ringing for ?
I'm hungry Jane.
Of course you're hungry. You didn't eat your dinner. That's why you're hungry.
But you forgot my breakfast.
I didn't forget your breakfast.
I didn't bring your breakfast because you didn't eat your din din...
You know, we're right back where we started.
When I was on the stage you had to depend on me for everything.
Even the food you ate came from me.
Now you have to depend on me for your food again.
So you see we're right back where we started.
Why are you doing this to me ? Why ?
Doing what ?
Making me afraid to eat. Trying to make me starve myself.
Don't be silly. If you starve you die.
I don't know what you're talking about. You really must be sick.
Jane.
Did you ever stop to think that... if anything happened to me... I mean anything bad... there wouldn't be any money for you ?
I wouldn't be here to sign the checks.
You wouldn't even have pocket money.
Did you ever think of that ?
Yeah, I've thought about that.
Why didn't you eat your dinner ?
Because I'm afraid. You made me afraid.
I thought you were supposed to be the big girl in this family.
Nothing wrong with it.
You're just a neurotic, Blanche.
You know what ? You're just a neurotic.
Good morning Elvira.
Good morning.
Oh, please Jane. I'm so hungry.
I have to go now.
But just a little, please.
No. You didn't eat your din din so you'll have to wait til lunch time.
Oh, Jane please. Don't do this to me. Jane, please.
Good morning Elvira.
Good morning, Miss Jane.
I want to talk to you.
I want to apologize.
Apologize ?
Yeah. I wasn't feeling so well yesterday.
So I was unkind to you.
I want to make it up.
I got up this morning and fixed the house.
So you can have the whole day off.
Here's your 15 dollars.
Well thanks. But does Miss...
What I mean is, does Miss Blanche know about my taking the day off ?
Oh sure. She knows.
Alright, if you say so. See you next Tuesday then.
Yeah, have a good time.
Bye.
Bye.
Who was that at the door earlier ?
Elvira.
Where is she now ? In the kitchen ?
No. I gave her the day off.
She has a pretty hard time considering.
I told her to come back next week.
Oh, Blanche.
You know we got rats in the cellar ?
Good afternoon.
Mr Flagg ?
Yes, I'm Edwin Flagg.
I have an appointment with a Miss Hudson for 4 o'clock.
I'm Jane Hudson.
You're right on time, aren't you ?
Yes, I believe I am.
Come in.
We can talk here in the living-room.
Oh, I say, what a perfectly charming room.
So you're Edwin Flagg.
Yes. That's right.
I'll bring in some tea. You like tea ?
Oh, yes. I'm quite fond of tea.
You must have guessed that I am English.
Oh really ? How nice for you.
Oh, here let me help you.
It's a terribly big burden for such a little girl.
Thank you. You're very kind.
It's so hot today. Did you drive here in your car ?
Well, actually, I took a cab.
A bit of a nuisance, but I had to put my car in for servicing.
Cream or lemmon ?
Cream.
Sugar ?
My, looks good.
I always think it's nice to break bread with strangers, don't you ?
Oh, yes. Yes indeed.
I don't think you actually mentioned the exact nature of...
Well I've been retired for some time now and I've been taking care of someone in my family who is sick
And now you're free to return to your profession...
Yes
And what exactly... I mean, I take it you're a soloist.. some instrument... ?
I wonder if you can guess who I am.
Can you give me a hint ?
Well it's not really fair to make you guess.
I'm Baby Jane Hudson.
Oh.
Do you mean you're really the Baby Jane Hudson ?
Yes I am. And I'm going to revive my act exactly as I used to do it.
Of course some of the arrangements will have to be brought up to date...
Music changes so much, doesn't it ?
And they're desperate for new acts. Television, Las Vegas and all the clubs. There are a lot of people who remember me. Lots of them.
I don't see how you could fail.
You know I have a kind of a feeling... the minute I opened the door and saw you standing there.
I just knew we were going to be friends.
I've been thinking about costumes.
Costumes ?
Yes. I took some of my old ones down to be copied.
Do you think that's a good idea ?
Of course.
But I don't quite remember...
How silly of me, Edwin.
How could you. But I do want your opinion. I really do.
All my scrapbooks and stuff are in the rehearsal room where you can look at them and tell me what you think.
You'd like to see them, wouldn't you ?
Why, of course.
Oh, I wish daddy could be here right now.
You can never lose your talent, he used to tell me.
You can lose everything else, but you can't lose your talent.
Come on.
I think you'll find these clippings very interesting.
Daddy saved them for me from the very first.
He used to put them in special books.
I always liked that picture. It's so...
... so sad.
You always spoil everything.
No, Jane. I just wanted to know...
Who is down there. I'll tell you.
I got a friend down there. Someone who's come to see me.
He doesn't even know you exist.
And you don't like that, do you ?
You're wrong Jane. I've always wanted you to have friends.
That's what I've always wanted, really.
Then how come I never had any ?
Maybe you weren't... I mean... Maybe you were just too independent.
No, that's not why. You always stopped me from having friends. That's why.
Not any more, Jane. Not any more.
I'm pleased that you have a friend.
That's what you need.
Oh, sure.
I was just hoping I could meet him and we could have a nice talk.
Just the three of us.
Yeah. You'd like that, wouldn't you.
Then you could tell him a whole lot of lies about me.
Scare him off... or maybe have him for yourself.
I've written a letter to daddy
His address is heaven above
It's wonderful !
I've written a letter to daddy
His address is heaven above
I've written dear daddy we miss you
And wish you were with us to love.
Instead of a stamp I'd put kisses
The postman says that's best to do
I've written a letter to daddy
Saying I love you
I've written a letter to daddy
Saying I love you.
Edwin, you certainly can play, can't you ?
And you certainly can sing.
Oh, thank you. I can see you've done this kind of work before.
No... not really. Actually I spend most of my time on serious music composing and that sort of thing.
You mean this will be your first contact with show business ?
Not exactly.
You see, my father was quite well known as an actor.
In the movies ? Maybe I worked with him.
I shouldn't think so...
He's been dead quite a long time now.
I lost my daddy when I was quite young too.
Of course he was more in the classical tradition...
I mean as an actor... Shakespeare and that sort of thing...
People used to say daddy could have been a star in his own right.
He was a musician too.
What instrument ?
Piano and banjo.
Oh...
That's very interesting. The banjo is a very native American instrument.
My father was British.
But he never really got a chance out here in Hollywood.
That's too bad.
It's funny really, because actually he came from a rather distinguished family, socially I mean...
Yet nearly all the parts he had were playing menials... butlers and such.
Oh, really ?
Yes.
I don't think my mother ever really appreciated what he was trying to do.
Oh, I know what you mean.
It's very hard for an artist when people don't understand.
I remember when...
I sometimes try to explain to her that if you're going to produce anything decent in the way of serious music you must have the right atmosphere.
But of course, Delia can't understand that.
Delia ?
Who's Delia ?
You might not think it to look at her, but she's my mother.
For a minute I thought you had a wife or a lady friend tucked away somewhere.
Oh, no. No...
Nothing like that.
How much were you actually thinking of paying me ?
Paying ?
Well, what do you think ?
How about $100 ?
A week, of course.
Alright. I think that would be fair.
Then that's settled.
I don't like talking about money, do you ?
No. It's not that important, is it ?
Not like relationships between people
But the thing is if I'm going to move out and give up my pupils
I will have to know for sure.
When do you think of starting ?
Just when would you let me have some money ?
Well...
I've got some family matters to take care of... that should take about a week or so.
I don't see why we couldn't start rehearsing right away.
Tell you what, Edwin. I'll pay you first thing Wednesday.
A month in advance.
It's done.
How about going to dinner somewhere... somewhere nice ?
It sounds fine...
I'll tell you what. Why don't you come with me now
I've got to go down and pick up my costumes and we can go on to dinner from there.
I... promised my mo... Delia I'd be home for supper.
Oh.. I'll drive you home then.
I'm so excited.
You know, I know everything is going to go just marvelous...
I have to go up and change. I won't be a minute.
This is really a rather charming neighborhood.
Yes, I've always found it very pleasant.
I just can't wait to get started. We're going to be a great team the two of us.
I'm sure we are. I'll see you Wednesday.
Bye.
Bye.
This is Blanche... Blanche Hudson. I need your help.
Is the doctor there ? I must talk to him.
He's with a patient right now.
But I have to talk to him. I've got to.
Hold on, please. I'll see if I can interrupt him.
Dr. Shelby ?
Yes, Blanche. Miss Hill tells me you're a little upset.
What seems to be the trouble ?
You must help me. I need you here.
No, it's about my sister. I need your help.
I need you here. At the house.
No. It's nothing like that.
It's the way she's behaving.
You've got to come over right away.
Please. Before she comes back.
I don't quite understand.
Is this some kind of emotional disturbance you're talking about ?
Yes. She's emotionally disturbed.
She's unbalanced.
I don't know doctor. I mean...
Are you trying to tell me she's violent ?
Yes! Yes she is!
I'm not sure...
I... I don't...
Very well. We aren't getting anywhere like this.
I'll come over right away.
That was...
I know who it was.
No, Jane. It really was.
And I know what you're trying to do.
I'm not trying to do anything.
Honestly, Jane.
This is Blanche Hudson again.
Could I speak to the doctor ?
Oh yes, certainly. Hold on. I'll try to catch him.
Dr. Shelby.
Hello, Blanche. I'm on my way now.
Oh, I'm so glad I caught you in time.
Dr. Shelby, we're noy going to meet you after all.
I know.
But Jane has gone to another doctor.
Another doctor ?
Yes, another doctor.
Well, of course if she's chosen to go to someone else.
After all, we really can't interfere, can we if Jane's chosen to go to another doctor.
I'm very sorry.
Goodbye, doctor.
I thought I told you not to come back until next week.
I know you did, but I had a free day today so I thought I'd come by and see if there was anything needed doing.
Well there isn't anything so you could have saved yourself the trouble.
I was going to write you a note but now you're here I might as well tell you.
We're not going to be needing you any more.
But I don't understand.
We're closing uo the house.
Blanche wants to take a smaller place at the beach.
The doctor thinks that's best for her, so that's what we're going to do.
Oh, don't worry. You'll be paid for today. I'll send you a check.
I'm not worried about any pay. I'd just like to see Miss Blanche before I go.
Well you can't.
She's asleep.
That's alright. I don't mind waiting.
Well I do, I gotta leave so just give me the keys to the house.
I'm sorry I don't have the keys. I must have left them at home.
Anyway, go. You're fired.
Miss Blanche !
Miss Blanche !
Miss Blanche. Are you awake ?
Miss Blanche ! Are you alright in there ?
Wait there and I'll go find the key.
Good morning Miss Hudson.
Good morning.
How's Miss Blanche these days ?
She's just fine.
Do you have a deposit slip ?
Well, Blanche wanted me to get it all in cash this time.
I guess she has some special reason.
Yes, but doesn't she normally... I mean... if she isn't going to deposit her monthly check... she usually gives us a call and tells us what she wants us to do, doesn't she ?
Didn't she call ?
I don't think so.
Well I guess she must still be asleep. She gave me that check last night.
I see. Just a moment please.
I guess that will be alright, Miss Hudson.
50s and 20s are alright ?
Yes, please.
There you are.
Thank you.
Bye, now.
Miss Blanche, I'll tell you right now.
If that sister of yours has gone and given you sleeping tablets just to keep you quiet while she's out doing I don't know what
I'm sure as hell going to call the police on her.
Oh Miss Hudson.
I'm glad I caught you
I hope you don't mind but there's something I've been meaning to ask you.
What ?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm kind of short of help around the house
I was wondering if you would mind my asking your cleaning lady if she could give me a couple of days a week.
Well, as far as I'm concerned, you can have her as often as you want.
My sister and I are moving so we won't want her anymore but you have to call her. She isn't here. I've already sent her home.
But I just saw her.
Yes, but I sent her home.
But that's impossible. I saw her go in the house a few minutes ago.
In the house ?
Yes.
So you finally decided to come back ?
What are you doing here ?
I told you you were fired.
Never mind all that.
I wanna know what's going on around here.
You said you didn't have your key.
It just so happens that I did.
So now you can tell me what you mean by locking Miss Blanche in her room.
This isn't Blanche's house. It's my house and I can do as I like.
Doesn't make a difference whose house it is.
You've got to act like a grown woman, the same as everybody else.
Suppose there had been a fire with Miss Blanche locked up in her room like that.
Well, there wasn't.
You open that door and stop all this nonsense !
No !
Then give me the key.
No !
She's asleep. I gave her a pill.
You did ? Then you'd better give me that key and be quick about it.
I won't and you can't make me.
I'm not afraid of you.
Alright, Miss Hudson. I'm not going to fool with you.
If you won't give me that key I'll go right down and call the police.
You'll be sorry.
Give me that key.
I didn't mean her any harm.
Better not have done her any harm.
My God, Miss Blanche. What has she done to you ?
I'll get you off in a minute, Miss Blanche. Don't worry, Miss Blanche.
I'll get you down from here.
You just rest easy...
Going out, are you dear ?
You know I am.
Having dinner with her ?
Uh-huh
I'm forgotten. You won't be back too late, will you lovey ?
Who knows ?
You could have been better in all of them.
But they didn't want that.
They just didn't love you enough.
You know that they just didn't love you enough.
Edwin ?
Miss Hudson ?
I'm sorry, Edwin. I can't let you in. Not now.
Oh, to hell with it !
I can't let you in.
Not now.
What am I going to do ?
Oh, Miss Hudson... I thought... I didn't know there was anyone in here.
I just came home and I saw a light and I thought you had left the lights of your car on.
You know, I've had that happen to me.
That's alright, Miss Bates.
I've had that happen to me once. It was no joke.
Wake up in the morning and find you have a dead battery. No joke.
Well, as long as everything is alright I guess I'll just say good night.
Good night.
That doesn't prove anything.
Now what do you think you'll do ?
I'll manage, lovey.
I suppose you think I'm making all this up.
I wouldn't know.
Well, Hazel should know, shouldn't she ?
She worked in the same studio and that's where it all happened.
Just after one of those studio parties and right in front of her own house.
Jane Hudson drove her car straight on her own sister and crippled her for life.
Oh come on. You mean she tried to kill her ?
Yes, she did. She tried to murder her own sister.
How is it they didn't arrest her then ?
They would have. But the studio had it all tapped because of Blanche Hudson's career.
That sounds very likely.
Yes, so the fine woman you've chosen to run around with has got to be broke.
And a murderer as well !
I see !
Well it's true !
If it's true I'll ask her about it when I see her again. How's that ?
You wouldn't see a woman like that again.
Why not ? You just told me she's got a rich sister.
You haven't heard the worst of it yet.
You mean there's more ?
Yes there is.
After she'd run down her own sister your precious Jane Hudson ran off and left her there to die like some poor animal. She ran off and disappeared for 3 whole days.
What happened then ? Don't tell me they couldn't find her.
Oh, they found her alright.
They found her in some hotel room with a man she had never even seen before.
Why should that upset you ?
Isn't that how I was conceived ?
Hello.
Yes this is Miss Hudson.
She left.
About a week ago.
We have a report here filed by her cousin listing her as a missing person.
Did she tell you what her plans were or anything like that ?
No, I don't know a thing.
Well, we have a couple of other addresses to check. Maybe we'll come up with something.
Otherwise, we'll probably be getting in touch with you again.
Meanwhile, if you do hear from her we'd appreciate you letting us know.
Blanche !
Blanche !
The police are looking for Elvira.
It wasn't my fault. She wouldn't leave me alone.
I don't know what to do Blanche. What am I going to do ?
What am I going to do ?
If they find her, we'll have to run away.
That's what we'll do. We'll just go away.
Oh, but then I wouldn't see Edwin anymore.
He wouldn't like what I did.
It wasn't my fault, but he wouldn't like what I did.
I don't care. We'll go to the beach. We'll live by the seashore all the time like we used to.
When I was little and daddy was there.
And maybe we'll have friends...
People would come and see us...
Oh, I'd like that.
Blanche.
Blanche, listen to me.
You know I always wanted everything to be nice, don't you ?
I don't see how Elvira could make me do a thing like that.
I just don't understand.
It was like that time in the hotel room when they came and told me you were hurt and that I'd done it.
And there was a big man there... a policeman... and he hit me and he slapped me and I tried to tell him that
I couldn't do a thing like that. Not to my own sister...
Jane.
He said I was a liar.
The accident...
No, it wasn't an accident.
I did it. You told me so yourself.
I must tell you...
I don't want to talk about it.
Everytime I think of something nice you remind me of the bad things.
I only want to talk about the nice things.
Remember when daddy and I used to rehearse at the beach ?
I'd be dancing on the sand. And all the people would come and watch.
All crowd around to see Baby Jane Hudson.
What'll I do ?
Let them in...
The police ?
It may be Edwin.
Of course. It's Edwin.
Edwin !
You aren't gonna tell on me.
No Jane, please...
There !
Edwin !
Edwin.
Wait for me.
Miss Jane Hudson ?
Yes.
I'm sorry, Miss Hudson,  but we just picked up this young man in front of your house.
Says he's on his way in to see you. Is that right ?
I don't understand.
They're trying to say I'm drunk.
Let's just say you're a little happy, ok ?
Who's happy ?
I'm not happy.
So now you know.
That's right. So now we know.
Sorry to have bothered you Miss Hudson. Good night.
I have the money. Really I have. But don't be mean to me.
You promised me.
I know I did, and I have the money.
Look, let's go in the kitchen and have a drink together.
It's nice there, and then we can be friends again, and everything.
I've got something else for you too.
What ?
It's a surprise.
Would you like to have a...
You're gonna like your present.
You're really gonna like it. Drink your drink, Edwin.
I'll go get it for you.
This is my very own. It's a genuine Baby Jane doll.
I used to give them to all my really good friends.
The people that I worked with.
They made them for me.
Marvelous.
...specially...
Very lifelike.
Now Jane, you talk to nice Mr Flagg and nice Mr Flagg will have his money in a minute.
Oh, you're not comfy like that, are you ?
Let's go bye-bye.
Here comes the superchief !
Edwin ! Edwin ! Stop it !
What was that ?
Nothing. I didn't do anything.
Edwin. Edwin. Please...
She'll take you away from me !
Please. Help me.
Please. Help me.
She's dying.
For God's sake ! She's dying.
Get away from me !
Edwin ! I've got your money !
Edwin ! Do come back ! Your money !
He hates me...
He hates me.
Stop !
He's going to tell...
He's going to tell !
Blanche ! Blanche !
You've got to help me.
We've got to leave.
Please, please, Blanche.
Help me.
I like this place.
We can just sit here for awhile and pretty soon the sun will come up and it will be nice.
You should look at the sea.
It has all lights on it.
You used to like that.
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.
At 11:25 this morning all local law enforcement agencies have assigned special details to the kidnap slaying mystery that surrounds the famed Hudson sisters.
It is beleived that Blanche Hudson. film great of the early 30s, has been forcibly abducted by her sister
Hey Ernie, get a load of this... from the family home on North McGavin in Hollywood some time between the hours of 10 p,m. and 10:30 p.m. last evening.
With the exception of one witness who reportedly saw the Hudson car, a 1940 or 1941 black convertible heading West on Wilshire and Santa Monica no report has been recieved to date...
So they found that colored woman ?
Yeah, they found her alright.
Sure is a rotten way to get your picture in the papers.
You reckon they'll ever find that Baby Jane or whatever her name is ?
Yes, we'll find her. But I guess maybe it'll be too late.
Oh, Officer. There's a car down there parked right on the road.
I almost got stuck in the sand when I tried to get around it.
You mean that old Lincoln convertible ?
That's right.
It was parked over there when we opened up this morning.
The keys are there, but I didn't want to move it. I thought maybe...
What do you figure ?
Cops ? How do you figure cops ?
This is it.
You must be hot.
Jane.
Help me.
I'm afraid...
Find someone. A doctor.
I can't.
If I die... you'll be alone.
But they'd be mean to me like they were before.
I don't want to hear.
Jane, I'm dying.
There's no time.
You must listen.
I made you waste your whole life
Thinking you had crippled me.
Please stop.
You didn't do it, Jane.
I did it myself.
Don't you understand ?
I crippled myself.
You weren't driving that night.
You weren't driving.
You were too drunk.
I wouldn't let you drive.
I made you go open the gates.
I watched you get out of the car
You had been so cruel to me at the party.
Imitating me... making people laugh at me...
I watched you get out of the car
I wanted to run you down. crush you... But you saw the car coming.
I hit the gates snapped my spine...
Then you mean... all this time we could have been friends ?
You were frightened.
You ran away.
I managed to crawl out of the car up to the gates...
When they found me they assumed it was your fault.
You were so drunk... confused... you didn't know any better.
You weren't ugly then.
I made you that way.
I even did that.
There's a place up there that sells things.
You like ice cream.
I'll get you some.
Yeah ?
Do you have ice cream ?
Yes, what flavor ?
Vanilla, coffee, strawberry, lemon...
Strawberry, strawberry, please. Two big strawberries, please.
That'll be 40 cents !
Thanks...
Right. You'd better send some more help.
Miss Hudson !
We've been looking all over for you Miss Hudson.
I'm sorry, but we must find your sister.
Is she down here in the beach with you ?
Yes she is.
I'll take these for you.
Oh no, they're mine.
They're for my sister Blanche.
She's going to be a movie star, you know ?
That's right, Miss. We want to find your sister because I think maybe she needs help.
I think maybe she's in trouble.
Would you show us where she is, please ?
Won't you take us to her ?
Please, Miss Hudson.

My dear wife, as the ancient saying goes...
"In wine is truth!"
Insincerity, the mark of a drunkard!
If you could or would for one brief moment... shut that vast, resounding chasm... of a mouth, I should be grateful, madam.
What care you for the deprivations...
I have suffered in the name of marriage?
O mariage de convenance.
O cant, O guile, O mockery!
Oh, shut up.
Oh, how can you insult me so?
Very easily, madam.
I have but to listen to your fatuous brain.
Do you hear his churlish insults, Father?
Father!
Huh? What? What?
Sugar? Yes, here you are.
Oh, whatever possessed me to marry you?
That is a question I oft inquire of myself, madam... to which there is no satisfactory answer... save one, perhaps, and that is that no one else would have you.
Only a man who drinks could talk like that.
We escape the unendurable however we can.
How I despise you!
Poor, abused Amaryllis.
You never cared a fig for me.
You only courted me to gain control of father's business.
What other reason could there be?
Oh! Did you hear that?
Does he ever?
Father!
Huh? What? Huh?
I gave the sugar to you once.
There!
Shall I give him some medicine?
Pretty close.
Merely for purposes of enlightenment, Mr. Trumbull.
I could have been the greatest opera singer in the world.
What world?
Would the vocal emissions of a laryngitic crow... be qualifications?
Yes, then, perhaps, you could have been.
What know you of art and beauty?
Tosspot, soak, inebriate!
Your mouth, madam.
Shut it!
Anybody could be proud to rest in this coffin.
You can't even keep our heads above water!
Why, you've only had one customer in the past 9 months.
My father had a thriving undertaking business... until you proceeded to get ahold of it... and run it into the ground!
Where else?
A thriving business.
The receipts of which he used... to cram this house with monstrosities!
If my father chose to spend his hard-earned profits... in the collection of curious objects...
He did more than collect curious objects, madam.
He also fathered one.
I despise you!
Demon rum will get you yet!
I look forward to that day with keen anticipation, madam.
Oh, what I wouldn't do to get her down here as a customer.
Good afternoon, Mr. Tremble.
Trumbull!
Will you learn to pronounce my name correctly?
I said Mr. Tremble.
What in the name of all that's holy is that thing?
This?
This is the new coffin.
I don't like to see anybody buried naked.
I don't... I just don't...
No one in their right mind would be caught dead in that thing.
My coffin.
How gratifying, Mr. Gillie... to have a master craftsman in one's employ.
Well, I'm going out and drink myself... into a state of stupefaction.
Mr. Trumbull.
Oh, how do you do, Mr. Black?
How nice to see you, sir.
That remains to be seen, sir.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a singularly pressing...
A boon, sir.
A trifling matter of a year's rent in arrears.
Has it been a year?
Each and every unpaid day of it.
Well, what do you know about that?
And much as I regret to dun you, dear sir... it is unhappily incumbent upon me... as owner of these premises... to regard your monetary dereliction as... shall we say, inconvenient to my purposes.
Oh, well, now I...
So vastly inconvenient, one might add... that should the debt remain outstanding... for as much as 24 hours more...
I fear that... legal machinery must... perforce, be set in motion.
And Messrs. Hinchley and Trumbull... face the incommodious prospect... of taking up residence in the street.
In the street?
Have I expressed myself with clarity, Mr. Trumbull?
With extreme clarity, Mr. Black.
Then we are of one mind...
Our mutual interests in accord.
24 hours, Mr. Trumbull.
Good day to you, sir.
Good day to you... you penny-pinching old pig.
Mr. Trumbull?
And as for you, you sniveling...
To forego the glories of an operatic career for him.
No, no, Cleopatra.
No, no, sweetheart.
Oh, I came up here to... to get a glass of water. lf... if he continues mistreating you like that, I'll...
I wouldn't know what to do.
Beautiful.
Will you stop that ungodly caterwauling!
Must have been an earthquake.
Mr. Gillie!
In the parlor.
Drunk again, huh?
John Barleycorn and Hinchley.
They're the partners in this business.
Time for your medicine, old man.
Oh, thank you.
Father!
Do you really think I'm going to let you poison my own father?
Hope springs eternal in the human... yes.
Why do you always take my medicine away?
Don't you care nothing about my health?
Yes, sit down, Mr. Gillie.
Comfortable, Mr. Gillie?
Well, Mr. Gillie...
I am afraid that it is... decision time.
Decision time?
Yes, Mr. Gillie.
Business being, once more on the trembling verge of ruin... it behooves us to acquire a bit of income.
Therefore, Mr. Gillie, it is necessary that we... venture forth tonight.
Not so soon again!
Yes, so soon again, Mr. Gillie.
What if I refuse?
If you refuse, Mr. Gillie... which possibility
I find most remote... however, if you refuse,
Mr. Gillie... the local constabulary shall forthwith be apprised... of sundry illicit peccadillos... in which one Mr. "G" has been involved.
Peccadillos?
What if I tell them the truth?
And tell them that it was your idea in the first place?
Mr. Gillie...
Felix...
Friend...
I put it to you.
Who, in your discerning estimation... do you think they're most likely to believe?
Mr. W. Trumbull, respected citizen... and entrepreneur of death... or Mr. Felix Gillie... wanted fugitive and confessed bank robber?
I've never confessed!
They just proved it.
One of these days...
One of these days, I...
One of these days what, Mr. Gillie?
Nothing.
Exactly, Mr. Gillie.
Nothing.
Shall we say...
Midnight?
Midnight it is.
All right.
You are most accommodating,
Mr. Gillie.
Until midnight, then.
He's a perfectly delightful old gentleman.
Owns a fleet of merchant vessels operating out of Boston.
He and I enjoyed a most delightful afternoon... of conversation together at the White Bull Tavern.
Later on, I walked him home.
Lives in a marvelous old house out there on Winkle Road.
Wait till you see it!
Well, come on.
- I have an idea.
- What?
I'll wait for you right here.
Mr. Gillie, without your cunning fingers... how should I gain entrance?
Come on!
All right.
Get to work.
You know, the next time they catch me with these tools... it can be 30 years.
It's no wonder they caught you the last time.
You're probably the most inept... house breaker in all of New England.
That's true.
Did you try the knob?
No, why?
Quiet.
Quiet, quiet.
Pardon me.
Quiet!
I didn't mean to do it.
If they didn't hear that... they must all be as deaf as old Hinchley.
I didn't mean to.
Come on.
I don't like this.
What are you doing?
- Quiet. Get up.
- My foot...
- Get up.
- Your foot, my fingers.
Get up.
Come on.
If you make one more sound...
Now, you sit there,
Mr. Gillie... and don't you make a sound, Mr. Gillie.
As a matter of fact, don't you even breathe, Mr. Gillie.
Do you understand me?
Exactly.
I shall return presently.
Fait accompli, Monsieur Gillie.
The stream flowed, lapping, lapping... and the leaves stirred, tapping, tapping... and the ancient belle dames napping.
Dreamed of gently rapping, rapping.
Rapping gently with a hammer on a baby's skull.
Asleep yet, Mr. Gillie?
How can I sleep when
I know what you've done?
A little medicinal nip?
No, thank you.
More's the pity.
And a white brooch...
Well, thus we end our lonely vigil, Mr. Gillie.
Forward!
Dear child.
Dear child, what is amiss?
Oh, sir, my master has, to all appearances... succumbed in his sleep, and I must run to fetch the doctor.
Oh, cataclysmic circumstance.
Perhaps I can be of assistance.
Oh, sir, could you?
Well, I believe I could.
Take me to your mistress.
Oh, yes, sir. Thank you.
Oh, not at all, my dear.
Not at all.
It is my pleasure to help.
Hinchley and Trumbull are always at your beck and call.
I am afraid, madam, that he has made... his final crossing to that Gidgeon shore.
What?
He's dead.
Allow me, madam, in this moment... of your most desolate bereavement... to lift from your sorrow-laden shoulders... the burdensome tasks of exequy and sepulture.
What?
I'll bury him for you.
For by the most coincidental of vicissitudes, madam...
I happen to be the owner and director... of a local funeral parlor.
You are?
Yes, indeed.
As we like to say to those we serve...
"When loved ones lie on the lonely couch...
"of everlasting sleep...
"let Hinchley and Trumbull draw the covenant."
How tender.
Yes, isn't it?
Remove the carcass.
Where in the name of blue blazes is she?
Play! Go on.
Now?
No, not now, you old fool!
We have to wait for the damned widow to get here.
Huh, what?
Oh, yes, yes.
He does look very natural.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
Never mind.
Is your mistress here?
No, sir. No one is.
What?
What's happened?
Where is the widow Phipps?
Gone to Boston, sir... with everything.
She's going to live in Europe.
Europe?
Yes, sir.
She's discharged all the servants.
They've all gone home but me.
And she left nothing?
- Sir?
- No money?
Not a penny, sir.
Well, what about my fee?
Oh, sir, I don't know.
She didn't even pay me my wages.
Is there no morality left in this world?
Don't you think you've had eno...
Shut your mouth.
Women!
As soon put your trust in them as put a pistol to your head.
- You really...
- Be still!
Old Ben Johnson, buried standing up.
Can't trust anybody these days.
The world is full of knaves and felons.
Don't you think that you're being overly...
Be silent!
Edward III... buried with his horse.
Just because one customer...
Are you gonna shut your mouth or not?
- Mr. Tremble.
- Trumbull!
I said Mr. Tremble.
Well?
Pardon me.
Alexander the Great, embalmed in honey, so they say.
Egyptians used to hollow 'em out and pour 'em full of resin.
Will you shut the old goat up?
Don't you dare refer to my father...
And you shut up, too.
Egyptians used to bend 'em in two... and stick 'em in a vase of salt water.
Father.
And give 'em false eyes.
Father, please.
- Medicine old man?
- Don't you dare!
Yank their brains out with a hook.
- Father!
- Huh? What? Huh?
Oh, there you are.
You're eatin' much too much sugar.
You know that, don't you?
My medicine!
I'll have you arrested.
Mr. Gillie?
In the parlor.
Excuse me.
Of course.
There you go, keeping my medicine away from me again.
I don't believe you care... whether your poor old father lives or dies.
- Do you want me?
- Yes, Mr. Gillie.
We are going out again tonight, Mr. Gillie.
- Tonight?
- Yes, I said tonight.
- Tonight?
- Don't try to argue with me.
- I said tonight!
- Tonight?
What if the same thing happens... that happened to us the other night?
Well, it's never happened before, has it?
But what if it does happen?
Are we going to go out another night and another night... and look for another man and another...
We'll pick someone who isn't married, Mr. Gillie.
And how are you going to do that?
Wake up everybody before you do that horrible thing to him... and ask him whether he's married?
Or are you just going to kill off any old man... that comes your way?
Mr. Trumbull, sir,
Mr. Black wanted...
"Dear sir...
"If total payment for the past year's rent...
"is not received by morning...
"I shall instigate proceedings for eviction.
"Signed John F. Black, Esquire."
Mr. Black.
Precisely, Mr. Gillie.
To paraphrase the venerable adage... we shall kill 2 birds with one pillow.
We just can't go on like this forever.
Oh, nonsense, Mr. Gillie.
This is a sizable community... with more than an adequate supply of... of customers.
Take Mr. Black, for instance.
He's a widower and therefore no risk of a mercenary widow bolting with a plunder of inheritance.
And besides, with him, there's a double profit.
The only thing that bothers me... is why I never thought of it before.
There must be a little more honest way... to conduct a funeral business.
I might expect that kind of talk from a criminal.
Stop.
Whoa! Whoa!
Having a little trouble, Mr. Gillie?
This dirty lock was never made for picking.
Then why don't you take an ax and chop it open?
Nobody, but nobody, tells
Gillie what to do with locks.
No, I take it back.
What you need is a keg of gunpowder.
Hey, I have an idea.
Maybe there's a bolt on the inside.
There's a bolt on the inside of your head, Mr. Gillie, and it's loose.
But that has nothing to do with doors.
Then what about the front door?
Certainly that has a bolt, too.
Then try the windows.
All these windows?
That is not my specialty.
It's an order, Mr. Gillie.
All right. I'll try.
Well?
It's impossible to get inside.
Even the windows?
Every one of them has a bolt.
Why, of all the distrustful...
Well, I will not be denied.
Mr. Tremble...
Trumbull.
Mr. Tremble, I know, but what are you going to do?
Fly down the chimney?
None of your sauce, Mr. Gillie.
Thinks he can keep me out, does he?
You're positive about the front door?
Positive.
And the windows are all bolted?
Bolted.
You refer, of course, to the downstairs windows?
What?
What do you mean by "downstairs windows?"
Are you thinking of...
I think you are thinking of...
- No.
- Yes.
No, no.
Ascend, Mr. Gillie.
Well, don't caress it,
Mr. Gillie. Climb it.
We're not doing very well, are we, Mr. Gillie?
I told you I was not very good in climbing.
You're not very good at anything... are you, Mr. Gillie, unless it's bungling.
Get up!
It's not my fault... that all the doors and windows are closed.
Shut up!
Here.
Thank you, Mr. Tremble, thank you.
What did you step in?
Well, clean your boots off, for pity's sake.
I tried.
Couldn't you get somebody else?
No, I have my heart set on Black.
Now, come.
Let's try again.
All right, I'll try, but I can't promise.
Now grab the roof.
What do you think I'm...
I'm trying to do?
Well, do it before you break my back.
Here I go.
Well, go then!
Planning to spend the night up there, are you?
Definitely not.
I don't think this is a good idea.
Go on!
Go on, get on up there.
Why did I ever escape from prison?
It was so peaceful there.
You're gonna open that door for me if it takes you all night.
"Turn, hell-hound, turn!
"Of all men else
I have avoided thee:
"but get thee back;
"my soul is too much charged with blood of thine already.
"I have no words: my voice is in my sword:
"thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out!
"Thou losest labor:
"as easy mayst thou the intrenchant air...
"that thy keen blade impress as make me bleed:
"let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
"I bear a charmed life...
"that must not yield, to one of woman born.
"Despair thy charm;
"and let the angel whom thou still hast served...
"tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb untimely ripp'd."
"Accursed be that tongue that tells me so...
"for it hath cow'd my better part of man!
"And be these juggling fiends no more believed...
"that palter with us in a double sense..."
Come on, go to sleep.
"And break it to our hope.
"I'll not fight with thee.
"Then yield thee, coward, and live to be the show...
"and gaze o' the time:
"we'll have thee as our rarer monsters are...
"painted upon a pole and underwrit...
"'Here may you see the tyrant.'
"I will not yield...
"to kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet...
"and to be baited with the rabble's curse."
Crazy as a bedbug.
"Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane...
"and thou opposed, being of no woman born...
"yet will I try the last.
"Before my body I throw my warlike shield.
"Lay on, Macduff, and damn'd be he who first cries...
"'Hold, enough!"'
Have at you, sir!
Who are you?
Gillie is my name.
Help! Help!
Get up. Get up!
Where am I?
Outside of Mr. Black's house.
- Do you know what happened?
- No. What?
He recited a hymn or something.
Then he chased me with a big sword.
Ow.
You rang, sir...
Sir!
Get up! We've got to make a run for it.
You've bungled it again.
It wasn't my fault.
Oh, no, it's never your fault, is it?
It's always...
Is that Black's servant?
Where's he going?
I know where he's going.
- Where?
- To the police.
Well, follow him.
Stop him! Go on.
A fine mess you've made of things again.
Servant, where are you going?
To fetch the doctor, sir.
My master's unconscious on his bed.
- He's dying.
- Dying?
Dying.
I wanted you to stop him.
Why did you let him go?
Why? Because Mr. Black is dying.
Oh.
Oh, how sad.
This man is dead.
Are you positive, Doctor?
I beg your pardon.
No offense intended, sir.
It's simply that
Mr. Black has been... subject to catalepsy for several years now.
- Oh.
- Oh, yes.
Several times he's presumed to have died... only to revive some hours later.
I see. Well, I'm quite surely positive he's dead.
But if you wish, I'll apply a few more tests.
Oh, if you would, sir, if only to be absolutely certain.
All right.
He left the window open.
I'm sorry, but your master is quite dead.
Up, down.
Up and down all night long.
Up and down and up...
He has departed the earth, tenderhearted his soul... no longer by grief invaded, and music lingers from...
Yes?
Good evening.
Mr. Black and I have an appointment.
Pick up your end, Mr. Gillie.
You're dragging.
My end must be heavier than... than your end.
You're going too fast, Mr. Tremble.
Butterfingers.
He's... he's pretty heavy for such a skinny bird.
He probably has all his gold sewed up inside of him.
All right... 1, 2, 3...
There.
Well, how nice to see you here, Mr. Black.
We are not going to embalm him tonight.
We haven't embalmed anybody in 6 years.
Why should we start now?
- I just thought...
- Well, don't!
You don't do it very well.
Me for bed.
And me for getting the horses to bed.
Honestly, if it... if it weren't for poor Amaryllis...
I don't think...
Did you speak?
Now what in the name of heaven is wrong with you?
Well, what about him?
I don't... I don't think... he's quite dead enough yet to bury.
You don't think he's quite dead enough yet to...
What... place is this?
You.
Not me!
Mr. Trumbull...
This man...
W-what am I doing here?
You're here because you're dead, Mr. Black.
The hell I am!
Oh, yes, you are.
Everybody else knows you're dead, Mr. Black... except apparently you.
What jiggery-pokery is this?
Not jiggery-pokery, Mr. Black.
Hinchley and Trumbull
Funeral Parlor.
You wouldn't dare.
Have we a choice, Mr. Black?
Dead, huh?
That's what the doctor said.
Well, he's dead now.
Let's put him in the casket.
I don't even want to see him anymore.
You're not going to bury him in it, are you?
In our one good casket?
Are you out of your mind?
Here we go.
Well.
Me for bed.
Me, too.
What, by...
Oh, no.
What place is this?
Shut the lid!
What are you trying to do?
Break my hand?
Come on, come on.
Be a nice boy and stay in there where you belong.
No! No! No!
What's the matter with that idiot?
Doesn't he know when to quit?
Let me out of here!
We most certainly will not let you out of here, sir.
Confound you, sir!
Confound you, too, sir!
Will you kindly have the goodness to die?
Never!
Help!
Let me out!
For a man in his condition... he certainly has a lot of energy.
The stubborn crackpot.
I could have sworn he was dead.
It's about time.
I've never had such an uncooperative customer... in my whole life.
I regard your actions as inimical to good fellowship.
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Oh, yes.
- Leave me alone.
- Oh, yes, we do.
He bit me!
The son of a bit me!
- Let me out of here!
- Hand me that mallet.
Let me... out of...
Get me a gag and some chain.
- Mr. Tremble.
- Trumbull.
I said Tremble.
Everybody's here.
All right. Tell them we'll be ready in a minute.
Is he dead?
Yes. Now, get out of here.
Ungrateful employer.
He is not dead but sleepeth
He is not dead at all
His eyes will open and he will see
The beauties of eternity
He is not dead but sleepeth
He is not dead at all
I wish she would have picked another song.
I wish her vocal cords would snap.
He is not dead but sleepeth
He hath not left our side
For constantly
Could we but view
He watches everything we do
He is not dead but sleepeth
He is not dead
At all
Huh? What? What?
You know, if Mr. Black wasn't dead already... that note would kill him.
My friends, we have gathered ourselves together... within these bog-grieved walls... to pay homage to the departed soul of... what's-his-name... whom the pious and unyielding fates have chosen to pluck... from the very prime of his existence... and place in the bleak sarcophagus of all eternity.
That's pretty good.
Very good, huh?
And so, my friends, we find ourselves... gathered 'round the bier of Mrs...
Mr. You-Know-Who.
This litter of sorrow, this can, this cromlech... this dread dokhma, this gut, this mastaba... this sorrowing dope, this unhappy cumulus... this... this... what is the word?
This... coffin.
Never could think of that word.
Requiescat in pace,
Mister... Mister...
The memory of your good deeds... will not perish with your untimely sepulture.
In the hearts of those who love you, you will live on.
Of all the tricky, underhanded deceitfulness... not to even tell us that this thing... is going to be put into a crypt instead of into the ground.
Now we're gonna have to buy another one... for the... for the services.
I'll be very glad to build a new one.
It's like parting from an old friend.
Good-bye, old friend.
Maybe someday we can exchange it.
And do what with the body?
Same as we always do, take it out of the box.
But they'd see it.
No, I'm afraid we're just gonna have to buy another casket... and after having used this one for only 13 years.
Only 13 years?
You know, I wonder what idiot... ever thought of putting bodies in a crypt... instead of in the ground where they belong.
Yeah, and they fertilize plants, too.
What a terrible thing to say. Shut up.
At least we have some money coming in.
Yes, we have.
Did I say "we"?
No, never.
A good day to thee, sir.
And a good day to thee, sir.
Have thee a good sleep.
What place is this?
Ouch!
Oh, you're my angel.
- You're my angel.
- Well, ain't you classy.
I must. I must, I must.
Forbear, Felix.
Forbear, forbear.
I don't know what that word means... but I can't take it any longer.
I... I can't take it!
I'm so sensitive.
Mr. Trumbull?
Waldo?
Aren't you coming to bed... husband?
Get outta here.
Waldo, don't be like that.
Get away from me!
Am I so repulsive?
That's the word, yes.
Couldn't you find it in your heart to love me, Waldo?
- Well?
- Get up!
You're sittin' on my money.
Then you reject me?
As long as there's liquor in the house.
Oh?
Very well.
Then I shall not answer for the consequences then.
Very well.
"Then I shall not answer for the consequences then."
What... what... what... what?
What is it?
He's so cruel, so thoughtless.
All he thinks about is his bottle.
Never of me.
Pardon me.
Better take him upstairs.
Him?
Upst...
Felix...
Oh, Amaryllis!
Oh, darling!
Please, run away with me.
Be my wife. Be my love.
I'll let you study opera.
I'll let you study music, anything, anything.
Oh, Felix. Oh, mon amour.
Everything is going to be so magnifique.
Rain, rain, goeth thee away
Come thee again some other day
What manner of cry be that?
Do... do... do thee not choose to sleep, sir?
Well, if thee insist... perhaps thee have a reason not to sleep, sir.
I'll ask thee.
Have thee patience, have thee patience.
I'm comin'.
It's not customary that I waken in the middle of the night.
For that, be grateful.
"Is this a dagger that I see before me?
"The handle toward my hand?
"Come, let me clutch thee."
Now, we... we must have a little talk, sir.
For thee too must sleep, like all the others.
Out!
"Therefore Macbeth shall sleep no more.
"I have done the deed.
"Didst thou not hear a noise?"
"The time has been that when the brains were out...
"a man would die and there's an end.
"But now..."
Felix, you've stolen my heart
Felix, we'll never part
Felix, Felix
Dites moi, dites moi
Dites moi, mon amour
Just like a nightingale.
"And therefore, Mr. Tremble..."
"Amaryllis and I have fled into the night...
"driven onward by the madness...
"of our all-consuming passion.
"Felix."
Come in.
I said come in!
That's not the front door.
All right, all right,
I'm coming!
Don't be so impatient!
Someone there?
Anyone here? Come on out!
What are you grinning about?
You old goat.
Now, I'm sure that that door was closed.
Something's been opening doors around here.
But what?
Nice Cleopatra.
Dites moi...
C'est vous, Monsieur Gillie?
"Blood will have blood, they say."
Get up.
"The devil damn thee black...
"thou cream-faced loon!
"Thy bones are marrowless, and thy blood is cold!"
Wait for me.
Wait for me!
"Sleep no more!"
"Macbeth doth murder sleep!"
I thought he was dead.
He'll never die.
Oh, good work.
It's a little better in the dark.
What is, decapitation?
"Painted upon a pole!"
"And underwrit!"
Would you let go of me?
Let go of me!
Go and find your own hiding place. Go on.
"Lay on, Macduff!
"And damn'd be he who first cries, 'Hold, enough! '
"Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits!"
"The flighty purpose never is o'ertook...
"unless the deed go with it!"
Thank heavens he's gone.
You!
"Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
"creeps in this petty pace from day to day...
"to the last syllable of recorded time."
"And all our yesterdays..."
"Have lighted fools...
"the way to dusty death.
"Out...
"out, brief candle."
"Life's but a walking shadow..."
"A poor player...
"that struts and frets his hour upon the stage...
"and then is heard no more."
That I'll believe when I see it.
"It is a tale... told... by an idiot."
"Full of sound and fury..."
"Signifying... nothing."
Well, if it was anyone else...
I'd think he was dead, but I...
Oh, Felix!
- Oh, mon coeur.
- What?!
- Oh, you've killed him.
- Me?
You've taken the one really beautiful thing...
And you've killed this poor man.
Poor man? He tried to chop your head off.
Monster!
- Go to bed.
- Go to bed?
I'll tell you where I'm going.
I'm going to the authorities.
I'll see you hang for this!
- Amaryllis, go to bed!
- Never!
- Go to bed, Amaryllis.
- You wouldn't dare!
Oh, no, of course not.
Well... who's next?
Amaryllis?
You. You...
You killed her.
My rose and... and she sang like a nightingale.
And I stilled the voice of the nightingale.
You... you dirty man!
With my... with my bare hands,
I'll kill you! I'll...
I've had enough for one night. Go away!
Oh, put that down.
"An eye for an eye,"
Mr. Tremble.
- Trumbull.
- I said Tremble!
"And a tooth for a tooth!"
Give no quarter!
Take no prisoner!
Forward!
March!
Amaryllis!
Ouch! That hurt.
Oh, what a night.
May I?
Mr. Trumbull?
Oh, Mr. Trumbull,
Mr. Black was seen walking through the streets!
Police!
Oh, to hell with it.
Police!
Well, if you can't lick 'em, join 'em.
What a blow.
Amaryllis, I...
I thought you were dead.
And I thought you were dead.
Isn't that funny?
I... I thought you were dead, and you thought I...
You will sing for me... often.
Anybody there?
Speak up.
Everything seems to be in order.
Bedtime. What? What's that?
Trumbull?
What are you doing on the floor?
Drunk again?
Not feeling well.
What you need is a good dose of your own medicine.
Keep it in your waistcoat, don't you?
There we go.
There.
That ought to take care of you nicely.
Not here to stop me.
Empty.
Whoa, you're feeling better already, huh?
Oh, no good reaching for it.
It's all gone.
You took every last drop of it... and me an old man that needs it more than you do.
That's the way it goes, though.
Let the old man go without.
Stick him in the battle.
Might as well go up to bed.
Nothing going on, as usual.
Nothing ever happens here.
Every day, the same old thing.
No change, no variety.
When I was young... we knew how to live.
See you in the mornin'.
What place is this?
Is there no morality left in this world?
Huh? What? What?!
Husband?
"Out brief candle."
My God!
Who could have done this evil thing?
Baron Frankenstein?
I am Baron Frankenstein.
I've brought it.
So I observe.
And so will half the county if you don't hurry up and get it inside.
Put him down there.
Go on.
Still warm. Excellent.
It ain't been gone long.
My assistant will pay you.
Thank you.
The head ain't much good.
I gave it a fair bit of a knock when...
I don't need the head.
So long.
What's he you going to do now?
Cut out his heart.
Cut out his heart?
Why not?
He has no further use for it.
Sure this is the man?
Stop!
Do you know who I am?
Yes, Father. Good night.
Just a minute.
I want a word with you.
Start the wheel, Hans.
Come on, man!
Hold it.
Now!
Good luck, sir.
Get rid of them, Hans.
Out of my way.
Look here...
In the name of God, out of my way.
Blasphemer!
Foul desecrator of graves!
You realize that you're trespassing?
This is my parish.
This is my property.
So will you please leave?
How dare you?
You are interrupting my work.
Your work?
The work of the devil!
Hans.
Please, Father.
You cannot...
The fiend's servant!
He'll be back... with help.
Destroyed.
You'll have to get away, sir.
Now!
They always destroy everything.
I'll get the carriage.
Hans?
Hans?
We're nearly there.
Where?
Karlstaad.
Karlstaad?
Didn't you tell me you could never go back there?
They have short memories,
I hope.
But it's less than
10 years ago.
Where else can I go?
I need money to buy new equipment.
Where else can I get it?
Have you any?
You know I haven't.
In my house, there are paintings worth a fortune.
Carpets, furnishings, all priceless.
I can sell them.
That's why I've come back to Karlstaad.
You'll be seen.
The chateau is empty.
As we go through the village.
It's nearly noon.
There won't be anyone there.
They'll all be working in the fields.
Nothing ever happens in Karlstaad.
There's a fair in the village.
The place is packed.
It's a feast of carnival.
What a stroke of luck.
Luck?
But you can't go through there.
On the contrary, Hans, the crowd will give us cover.
So many people about, they won't be curious about us.
Slowly, now.
There you are, Hans.
What did I tell you?
You were right, as always.
Not always, Hans. Frequently.
Not always.
We should see the chateau any time now.
There. There it is.
I can promise you a comfortable bed tonight.
Why can't they leave me alone?
Why can't they ever leave me alone?
Would you like to tell me about it?
What?
About what happened here that night... and why you can never come back to live here again.
Yes, I'll tell you, Hans.
I'll tell you what happened.
You've been with me long enough to know the direction my work has been taking.
It is my wish to disprove the old theories concerning the evolution of life... and the origin of the life force, and to restate them... simply in terms of biophysical chemistry... as chemical action and reaction... controlled by the external impulses.
I realized long ago that the only way to prove my theories... was to make something in my laboratory that actually lived.
I never told you, Hans.
I succeeded once.
It was a crude sort of success.
A hotchpotch of half formed ideas built into a half-formed being.
But it worked, Hans.
At least, I think it did.
I was never given time to fully assess my achievement.
They destroyed it.
What happened then?
There was a storm that night.
A storm such as
I've never seen before.
It had been building up for some days and at last it had broken.
There in the heavens was all the energy
I'd ever hoped for, Hans...
I could ever dream of, there for the taking.
All I had to do was harness it.
I was fully prepared.
I had been for weeks.
I even had a body preserved in ice, in readiness.
But until then I had not found a way to generate sufficient electrical energy... to create the spark of life.
That storm was the solution...
answer to my years
of dreaming.
Get away from him.
We've heard what you've been up to, Baron.
You're under arrest.
I was arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer... and working against God.
They ordered me to leave the town and never return.
I had no money.
I walked from the frontier.
How did you exist then?
I worked. I worked as a laborer, anything.
I worked and I saved.
I saved every penny until I could start again.
And you know the rest, one failure after another... and always hounded by these disbelievers.
But I'm not beaten yet.
It's only a matter of time.
I'll prove my theory.
I think you will.
This is madness.
Would you rather starve?
We'll eat over there at the inn.
You think it's safe?
What? The food?
You know what I mean.
You may be recognized.
Nonsense.
You think they care who we are?
Still, if it would make you feel any safer...
Thank you.
Landlord?
Landlord?
All right.
I want you to take my order.
Can't you see I'm busy?
That's nice for you.
I'd like two glasses of wine, some fresh bread and hot soup.
We're not serving meals.
You're licensed, aren't you?
It requires that you serve food as well as drink.
You have my order.
Just fill this up properly before you go, will you?
Thank you.
What's the matter with him?
He's busy and it obviously doesn't agree with him.
Drink up.
Well...
My old friend, the Burgomaster.
And the police constable.
He's Chief of Police now.
It's easy to see how he got his promotion.
That ring!
What of it?
That ring the Burgomaster is wearing, it's mine!
You cannot do anything about it now.
He's stolen it!
Keep your voice down.
What's the trouble here?
Nothing, officer.
Arrest that man!
What man?
Your Burgomaster.
He's a thief.
Are you drunk?
Either you arrest him, or I shall take action myself.
I know you.
Get after them!
Now you are a hen.
Oh, dear, now I think he's laid an egg.
Enough!
I wonder if any dear lady in the audience would be so kind as to lend me a hatpin.
Thank you, madam.
And now...
Now... you are the monster of the wicked
Baron Frankenstein.
Stop!
Come to me.
Look at me.
Look me in the eye.
Now...
Wake up.
Thank you.
Now, if you'd kindly join your friends in the audience... and let them tell you of all the things
I made you do.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
And now for my next experiment, ladies and gentlemen...
I shall require the services of two gentlemen from the audience.
Two gentlemen volunteers.
There we are!
In the corner there, the two gentlemen in the masks.
If you would kindly step this way.
We are most honored, ladies and gentlemen.
Most honored.
I assure you gentlemen, no harm will come to you.
On the stage, please.
Thank you.
And now, for this experiment, ladies and gentlemen... we must have absolute silence.
Absolute silence, ladies and gentlemen, so that I may exercise... the full force of my fantastic will power.
Now, gentlemen...
Stop! Stop the performance.
Everybody to leave by that doorway there.
How dare you break in here like this?
You have no right to come here.
How dare you interrupt a public performance?
I shall report you!
I shall report you to the Burgomaster.
Do you have a license to perform here?
License? What license?
I take it you do not hold a license.
What do I need with a license as I'm a great artist?
Universally known.
Right! You're under arrest.
Ach!
Outside.
You'll pay for this.
Coming to bed, my dear?
Yes, my little one.
I won't be long.
You can't go in there.
I said, you can't get in.
You can't go in.
I tried to stop him,
Your Honor...
What do you...
I've come for my property,
Burgomaster.
My ring, for instance!
I don't know what you...
My chairs, my desk, my carpet.
Even my bed!
Hark! My clothes!
How convenient for you that we're both the same size!
You have no right to be in this town, let alone in my house!
You had no right to enter my house and take what you please!
Your property was confiscated.
Confiscated? Stolen!
Be quiet, woman!
I'll send for the police.
There won't be any need.
I thought
I recognized you earlier,
Baron.
Arrest him.
It's a pleasure, sir.
You're going to be very sorry you ever came back.
Good night.
Frankenstein!
Come on.
Back to the chateau?
No, the police will be there before we could reach it.
We're getting out of this place altogether.
Where are we going?
Up there.
Up there?
It's the only way out.
I have to stop.
I can't go on.
Why do you stay with me, Hans?
To tell you the truth,
I often wonder that myself.
You get nothing but misery with me.
No. There is something else.
Knowledge.
You could get that at the university.
Not the knowledge that you have.
I think you have discovered what all the others are searching for.
I think you have found the true secret of life.
Thunder.
There's a storm coming up.
A sudden burst could start an avalanche.
We must find some shelter.
Look, sir.
Let's follow her.
The storm's building up.
We may have to stay here for some time.
Better get some rest while we can.
Thank you.
But have you enough for yourself?
She can't hear you.
Hans.
Hans, come here!
Hans, come on!
What is it?
Perfectly preserved.
He must have fallen into the glacier.
It's as if he was waiting for you.
Waiting.
Waiting for my return.
I'll restore the life that belongs to him.
We must get him back.
Back where?
To the chateau, of course.
Where else can I work?
That's it.
Stand clear.
Get up on the roof, Hans.
All right?
I hope so.
Switch off, quickly!
Switch on.
Let's have some chloroform.
No response.
There's no response, Hans!
Those blundering idiots destroyed his brain with their bullets.
But you repaired the brain.
I patched it up and put the pieces together again, but the life spark, Hans... the life spark has been destroyed.
He's alive, but his brain is dormant.
Anything they don't understand... anything that doesn't conform to their stupid little pattern... they destroy!
They have to destroy it.
Is there nothing you can do, sir?
So near...
But they haven't beaten me.
I won't let them beat me.
The brain is intact.
I know that.
The cellular structure complete, the whole metabolism is as it should be.
Then why will his brain not function?
Once it starts, it will continue.
I'm sure of that.
But how?
Some kind of physical shock?
I've just passed the full force of a bolt of lightning through his skull.
Isn't that shock enough? No.
It needs some direct mental shock.
Some direct contact with his mind.
Hans. That man at the fair.
Can't you leave me alone?
I'm doing the best I can.
All right, I'm coming.
All right!
May I come in? Thank you.
You were expecting someone else?
Yes. The police.
They've been plaguing me all day. What's it got to do with you?
It might have a great deal to do with me.
I know you.
The other day at the fair.
You came up on the stage the day I was run in... for not having my license.
You're nothing to do with the police, are you?
I am Baron Frankenstein.
You've got a nerve, haven't you?
How do you mean?
Coming here.
You're not supposed to be here.
I heard you've been thrown out.
I've been kicked out, too.
And you're going?
You're right, I'm going.
If I'm not out of here by sundown,
I'm to be done for 20 crowns.
That's what his honor, the Burgomaster, said at the trial.
Trial.
I've come to offer you a challenge. A challenge for your professional skill.
If you accept, you will be safe in my house.
And welcome.
You want me to hypnotize someone.
Is that it?
Exactly.
Who?
Not a girl.
I'm in enough trouble already.
A man.
If you can.
If I can?
I've not failed yet.
Who is he?
You can meet him now, at the chateau Frankenstein.
Up there? You're mad.
I've got to be out of this place by sundown.
You'll still have time if you fail.
Fail? Me fail?
There isn't a man born or woman that
I can't put under.
Then this experiment should prove very interesting.
Come in, man.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Hans, you remember
Herr Zoltan?
Professor Zoltan.
Is this the...
No, over here.
There's your subject,
Professor.
My God!
That's not human.
That's a monster.
Nevertheless... he has a good brain and excellent eyes.
I won't tell you where I got them, but I can assure they are perfect.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to stimulate his brain.
Start some train of thought.
Anything to act as a catalyst.
What?
Accelerate a reaction in his brain.
You haven't much time.
I shall need a strong light and a mirror.
There's no response.
You will sleep now.
You will sleep.
When I awaken you... you will do as I say.
Now... sleep.
There.
What did I tell you?
What did I say?
Remarkable.
Wake him.
What, now?
Yes, now. Wake him.
Very well.
Wake.
Wake up.
Stop him.
He may injure himself.
Get a hold of him!
He was in agony.
I had to operate on the brain.
It hasn't healed yet.
I'm grateful to you,
Professor. You've made the brain function again.
Before you leave, may I offer you some refreshment?
Only brandy, I'm afraid, but it's a good one.
You're going to leave him here?
Yes, he'll be asleep for some hours now.
Come this way.
It should really be champagne to celebrate such an occasion.
There isn't any there, by the way, is there, Hans?
I'm sorry, sir.
Never mind.
I'm sure the Professor won't.
You'll be able to have as much champagne as you want now anyway.
What do you mean?
You'll make your fortune out of him.
Your friend down there.
You'll be able to show him all over the world.
Show him?
Circuses, funfairs, places like that.
I have no intention of showing him.
What are you going to do with him, then?
Use him for my research.
Now, if you've finished your drink...
That's not good enough.
Not for me.
I don't understand you.
No. I don't suppose you do.
I'll have another one of these.
Will you please explain yourself?
Certainly.
That creature of yours... he won't do as you tell him, you know.
He has a brain.
He'll learn to understand me.
He'll understand you all right.
He just won't obey you.
That's all.
If you care to wait until he comes to,
I'll show you.
All right.
Now, young man...
I'll have another one of these.
Listen carefully.
I want you to do exactly what I tell you.
You need have no fear.
No one is going to hurt you.
Now, stand up.
Did you not hear me?
Stand up.
Do as he says.
Walk across the room.
Stop!
Turn around.
Come back.
Sit down.
Close your eyes.
Now, do you believe me?
What is it you want?
I won't be greedy.
A partnership in our handsome friend here.
Three ways:
You, the young one... and me.
I agree.
Sir...
I have to agree, Hans.
I have no choice.
Let's shake hands on it, then.
No need. I have given my word.
Boo!
Look at me.
Look at me!
Look into my eyes.
You are to go down to the village.
Do you understand?
You are to go down to the village and find gold.
Do you understand?
And I'll tell you where to find it.
Come on, outside.
You've had enough.
I really don't know what you're up to.
I mean you've had too much.
That's what I mean.
I do not, I assure you.
Don't bother.
Just go home.
Oh, my God.
In heaven's name, open up, will you? Open up!
I told you to go...
Please!
For God's sake, please!
Hans?
Have you seen the Professor this morning?
He's still asleep.
When he wakes, tell him I wish to see him, will you?
Sir.
Yes, Hans?
What do you intend to do?
About what?
About him, the Professor.
How do you mean?
Are you really going to let him stay?
For the time being, yes.
As long as he's of use to me.
Why do you ask?
I just don't like it, that's all.
Neither do I.
But we need him.
Don't forget, Hans, when he wakes, send him to me.
What's your story?
You're never going to believe this.
Probably not, but I'll do my best.
What do you do about breakfast?
It looks as if you're having yours now.
What, this?
We'll have to do better than this, you know.
I want to carry out these tests today.
He might be tired.
Tired? Why should he be?
After last night.
Last night?
He's had a good rest since then.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
All right.
What do you want me to do?
This thing comes...
Thing?
This creature comes striding...
What are you talking about?
This man.
Ten foot tall, he was.
No, more like 12.
Go on.
Listen to me.
Listen carefully.
There are people in the village
I want punished.
Do you understand?
They are bad men.
They must be punished.
You must do it quietly, carefully... and not be seen.
The Burgomaster.
Punish him first.
Then find the chief of police.
Punish him, too.
Good.
Now, go.
Good thing you can't hear what I say, isn't it?
You are a pretty thing, aren't you?
You won't complain if I touch you, either.
Because you can't talk.
Why should I waste my time on trash like you?
I'll be able to take my pick soon.
Certainly, Burgomaster.
Make way for the Burgomaster and his bride.
All clear for the Burgomaster...
Can't you tell me anything about the man who did this terrible thing?
Not a man.
It was horrible.
Not a man, it was a monster.
It was horrible.
Gods!
I didn't mean to kill.
I didn't mean...
Get out!
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you for this.
Hans.
Start packing our things.
We're leaving.
Here.
Here.
Come here!
Look up here. Let me in.
Open this grating.
What are you trying to tell me?
Stop!
Get out of his way, you fool!
Go back and kill him.
Go back and kill him!
Hans, he's escaped. After him.
Don't lose sight of him, whatever you do.
Baron Frankenstein,
I'm arresting you for murder.
Let me go.
For the murder of the Burgomaster, for the murder of my constable... and for the murder of this man.
The village is in danger.
Shut him up.
Take him away.
But I've just seen him,
I tell you.
I was close to him.
As close as me to you.
He was coming up that mountain like nothing I've ever seen.
All right.
Now tell me, what was he like?
Tall like a house, and hands as big as sheep.
But his face was all patched up and scarred.
Now, will you believe me?
Yes.
I believe you all right.
And now we're going to find your monster.
And when we've found him, we'll burn him.
Do you understand?
We'll burn him.
Come on.
Hans, did you find him?
Yes, I've got him downstairs.
Get her out of here.
Go on!
No.
Baron Frankenstein, can you hear me?
Open the door, please.
Get away! Get away from here.
Do you hear me? Get away!
They beat him, after all.
MATANGO
This is probably the psychiatric ward.
No... I'm sure that it is.
Everyone thinks I'm insane... but I know I'm not crazy.
They're all dead... every one of them.
No... I'm the only one dead.
It's true, the others are still alive.
Well, why didn't they return, you ask?
If you listen to what I tell you, it will probably convince you that I'm insane, huh?
It's so good to feel a breeze like this.
It let's me forget about everything.
Everything?
All of the garbage
I put up with in Tokyo.
You shouldn't say things like that.
Why not?
Tokyo is my favorite city.
All of my important things are there!
Oh, you!
What... ? Oh, no!
Hey, Yoshida!
You better forget about work!
Damn! This was going to be my best story yet!
That's what you always say.
Is this her first time on a boat?
It's alright.
It seems like she's not enjoying it.
Hey, it's my first time too!
You're different.
His girl won't even let him kiss her.
I don't see what's so funny!
What's the matter?
Teacher...
Are you feeling ill?
I'm not good at this.
I'm not very comfortable around them.
They're a pretty good bunch.
Give yourself a chance with them.
Do it for my sake.
Hurry it up. You can still work while you're listening to her.
She's a great sight for the eyes, huh?
That's so pretty!
So, that's Mami...
I wonder how she got into radio and television.
Someone's daughter... or wife?
Not exactly.
Maybe she's someone's mistress!
Well, cheers!
Just a moment.
This is bigger than a simple toast!
At this moment, we're on the open seas, far from the troubles of mankind.
- There is...
- Here you go again!
Aren't we part of mankind here?
I think it's quite clear that we're an exception to what I'm saying.
I'm going topside to take a look.
Hey, just a minute...!
I'm under orders. I'm the captain.
Well, here's to our new member, Akiko. Cheers!
Cheers!
We're going to have some rough seas tonight.
It's on the radio?
Yes. There's a low-pressure system heading west from the Kyushu area.
I thought we were going to have good weather.
The sea is already churning!
No, it's not that strong yet.
We should turn this boat around.
They want us to stay on this course.
We won't be able to go much further.
We're going to stay on course.
People act like children regardless of how old they are.
That's just the way the world works.
I'll take over if you don't want to go any further.
I'll continue on your course.
Well, you don't seem too confident about it.
I'd like us to keep sailing as we planned.
It should be fun going through some rough weather.
You're forgetting about the two women.
Don't worry about me.
I'm not against it.
Akiko...?
I'm alright.
Hey, it will be okay.
This yacht is the best you can buy, and it can weather any storm.
Captain! Captain! Come here!
What's wrong?
Alright... ready the sails!
Hey! Everyone on deck!
- Man the front sail!
- Right!
- Go!
- Go!
It's alright. Kasai told you so!
He said this is the best yacht money could buy!
Do you know how much he paid for it?
•40,000,000! I think he's crazy!
But anyway... he's going to take me to Europe in it!
Paris... Rome... Vienna...
It's wonderful!
I'm going to visit all of them!
Alright... we should be able to manage this.
The sea is pretty rough.
How are you feeling?
Not too bad, right?
Yes, really?
Well, I think we've had enough too.
Lower the main sail!
You're a professor of psychology, right?
About women... is it true that if a guy treats them bad... then acts sympathetic toward them...
They fall for him immediately?
That's the way all men think!
It's not psychology!
Hey! I'll be alright!
Switch places!
Are you okay? Don't worry.
Come on, relax!
Kasai! The engine, start it!
- The anchor! Throw the anchor!
- Right!
The mast is gone! Hey, get below!
Everyone, get below! Get below!
It's alright!
This yacht is too tough to sink!
I'm sure of it!
Hey, the radio's out! It blew up!
Hey captain!
This is all your fault!
The engine won't start!
How in the world are we going to fix it?!
What?!
Hey, where's Yoshida?
That idiot!
Damn!
Yoshida!
Yoshida!
Are you alright? Come on!
Hang in there!
Are you alright?
- Is he okay?
- Yoshida! Yoshida!
It's finally over.
It shouldn't be too long before they start searching for the yacht, right?
Naturally.
- We're drifting?
- Yes.
- South, I'd say.
- South?
Hey, where are we now?
Our direction-finder is damaged.
We're lost?
It seems so.
- How can a skipper like you...
- Skipper?!
If I'm the skipper, we would have returned to port the first time I said to go back.
You became the skipper then!
There must be something we can do.
Don't waste the energy!
We're not sure if we're going to need it!
It's time for the news.
the yacht was reported missing after a heavy storm.
The 7 people believed to be on the yacht are Masoko Kasai,
owner and current president of the Kasai-Sankyo Co
Etsuro Yoshida, a famous mystery novelist,
Mami Sekimuchi, radio and television star,
Kenji Morai, assistant professor of psychology at Yonan University,
Akiko Soma, a student of the university,
Aoyuki Sakuda, the skipper of the yacht,
and a sailor by the name of Senzo Yokoyama.
Because of the experience of the captain of the ship,
the Marine Bureau feels it may have survived the storm...
The batteries weren't very new.
A ship!
Hey!
Look out! Look out!
Look out!
What's wrong?
Hey, Yoshida! Yoshida!
Hang in there! Hey!
When is this fog going to go away?
Hey, how much water do we have left?
Be quiet!
You'll wear yourself out gabbing!
My head hurts!
What's going to happen to me?
What?
It's nothing.
Shut up!
Everyone knows... they all know what you're after.
They know why you didn't want to go back when the weather got worse.
No wonder why a woman is taboo on a ship... it's not because the gods are jealous of them!
It's more because they drive guys crazy in the head!
An island...! An island!
An island! An island! I see an island!
Hey, wake up!
Is it Japan?
I wonder if it's the Bonan Islands?
Is it deserted?
Well, let's find some food first, then we can look around the island.
It's getting foggy.
We better hurry and find something before the fog gets too thick.
Hey! Why go up there?
You don't have to come if you don't want to.
What's up?
Water!
Don't tell me that you can't hear it?!
It's water!
Hey! We found water!
Water!
Water?
These stones.. this island isn't deserted!
Someone built this by hand!
Hey, shouldn't we be heading back?
We think this path was man-made.
Let's go to the other side of the island.
We may find houses over there.
Hey, are we going to climb up there?
Be careful.
We're at the edge of a cliff.
Look over there!
It's a ship!
Hey, let's go down this way.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Hold it!
It's only a shipwreck.
Look at it. The sails are rotten.
I'd say it was beached well over a year ago.
But we should still go.
We don't know if anyone is still alive.
Hey... let's go, okay?
It's in terrible shape!
There won't be anything here but rotting bodies.
Don't say that!
I'll wait here. They would have eaten all of their food before they died.
Yoshida!
You girls wait here.
We'll take a look.
Let's go.
It looks pretty beat.
Someone could be living on board.
What happened?
The stairs are slippery. It's moss.
There's nobody here.
There are no bodies.
What unusual moss!
What was that?
What's with you?
I can't find a speck of food anywhere.
I'm going to see what's happening.
I can't stand waiting here.
That's a sea-water pump.
There's a geiger-counter.
This must have been a research ship.
The moss in this cabin is a different color.
It has no eyes!
It's an example of mutation caused by radiation.
Maybe the ship was studying the effects of a nuclear explosion.
I wonder why the moss hasn't covered these shelves?
Perhaps they're disinfected.
This alcohol lamp is clean too.
Chemicals seem to stop it.
This is carbolic acid.
If we scrubbed the cabin with it, it would be a perfect place to live.
What's this?
It's some kind of giant mushroom!
Matango... a kind of mushroom.
It's probably a new species found on this island.
We're in luck if this thing is edible.
Nothing else is written here.
What happened to the mirrors?
It looks like they were removed.
Hey... let's go.
This is the captain's cabin.
What's wrong?
What happened?
Stay out!
This is the captain's cabin.
We don't know if the logbook is in here somewhere.
Yokoyama.
Yokoyama!
You've found something to eat!
Who is it?
Don't look at me like that.
We found the food, and it's first come, first served around here.
Anyway, this logbook is all I found.
We can't determine what country this ship is from.
I have a feeling it was deliberately concealed.
The equipment is different as well.
Some is communist countries... the free world... and Japan, too.
Secret research, huh?
Involved in some kind of nuclear studies.
This certainly wasn't an ordinary research vessel.
We better figure out what we're going to do.
Just a moment! We should get Kasai.
He's had enough preferential treatment, huh?
What brings you to my door?
Hey, Kasai.
All of our provisions won't last more than a week at this rate.
You can't stay shut in this room all the time.
What do you expect me to do?
We need to plan for living here a month or two.
We're talking about that now.
We think you should come over to discuss it with us.
Oh, so you think I'm wasting my time?
I've been cleaning this up.
It should come in handy.
It should be able to get us some meat.
I think it will help us to stay alive.
Everyone, what's the matter?
Let's get started.
According to the logbook, this island is deserted.
There's hardly anything edible on it, so that puts us in a difficult situation.
Anyway, until we can leave here... we have to eat.
The canned goods will only last a week, so we have to look for food.
Fish... seaweed... turtle's eggs... anything we can eat, including snakes and lizards.
However, the mushroom should not be touched.
You mean it's poisonous?
We don't know for sure.
There seems to be a substance in them that damages nerve tissue.
That's all the records indicate, but there is other evidence.
It's unlikely that they would have left the ship, if they had an ample supply of food.
What we know from the log is that,
"Every day, several men went out
"to search for foods to add to their diet".
None of them ever returned.
Perhaps it was due to the mushrooms.
They grow in great abundance on the island.
Now, we should try to move the yacht to this side of the island in order to fix it.
This island is covered in fog most of the time.
Even if a ship passed by, we'd be lucky if they saw us.
So we should ready it for sailing.
Fix that thing?! Sorry, I'm out.
It just needs a little repair!
You won't get me on it.
If we're near the equator, that means Japan is far away, and I don't think we'd make it.
Japan is pretty far away, but I'm sure we would be rescued by a ship on the way.
On a ship, you're the skipper... so you give the orders, which is fine by me.
This really isn't a ship anymore... just a house on land.
Yoshida!
It's time you two stop running things!
Who are you to judge?
If you have a better idea, why don't you tell us?!
We shouldn't argue!
Everyone will have to do their share so we can get out of this.
The women will get the water.
You can go hunting if you want.
Whoever doesn't work on the boat should make an S.O.S. fire on top of one of the mountains.
I understand.
You take an awful lot of notes.
I'm glad I don't work that hard.
I use the thoughts of those I hire.
That's what takes talent.
There's nothing wrong with borrowing talent.
It takes ability as well as intelligence.
You're right.
Civilization has progressed by borrowing.
Each generation takes an idea and improves it.
Novelists do the same thing, right?
Your table is over here.
She's decided to come with us.
I'd like to come along.
We've walked a distance and haven't seen anything yet.
Weren't all the mirrors on the ship missing?
I wonder why they would bring them up here to break them?
There must be a reason.
Why'd he do that?
Do you think he saw us?
No. It seemed like he was avoiding the island.
Hey, that's not good.
The birds won't come near this island?
Sakuda!
Over there!
This island is a ship's graveyard.
Maybe it's the current.
It drags them off course, and they smash against the rocks.
Idiot!
Don't call me an idiot.
I came over here to help you.
Let's go.
Mushrooms.
I'd take a chance with them if i was starving.
Hey...
Hey, it was around here.
I'm sure I saw something.
Did we imagine it?
What? There's nobody here?
Hey!
What?
Someone's looking in here.
Who is it?
You can't trust any of the men around here!
This will fix him if he tries again.
What's the matter?
Something's wrong with the batteries.
Who is it?
You heard it?
Yokoyama.
Yokoyama!
Was that you?
I don't know.
Where did you go just now?
I don't need your permission to use the bathroom!
Who's there?
It's us.
What is this?
We're sure someone's walking on the deck.
Could it be Kasai?
Who are you?! Stay away!
What happened, Kasai?
What happened? What's the matter?
Hey!
Yokoyama! Yoshida! Wake up!
What's wrong with all of you?
In Tokyo, you guys know how to get around.
But on this ship you've become idiots... seeing ghosts in your head and believing it's haunted!
There's a reason for this, and I know what it is.
It's these women.
They're on your mind all the time and you can't do anything about it!
That's what's wrong with everyone.
It gets to me too, and drives me crazy!
Tonight,
I may just do something with you.
Are you men going to let him behave this way?
None of them seem to give a damn.
Damn!
- I'll kill you!
- Come on!
- Stop it!
- Let go!
That's enough of this!
Something else about her... she goes into the jungle with the writer quite a lot.
Seems they're carrying more than just water.
What do you know of my affairs?!
Hey... she's not denying it!
I know what woman Mami is.
I don't need you to tell me.
He's right.
I used you to get one thing.
Europe is what I wanted, not you.
I've always found you repulsive.
What?
Stop This !
Yokoyama, are you sure we saw a ghost?
What do you think?
Come here.
Yoshida, you too.
I suppose that's our imagination.
Let's stop fighting each other.
We have to find food and fix the yacht so we can get away.
Is that all you've got to say?
All he's done is carry that gun around, and what can he show for it?
- Hey!
- Yeah, let me finish!
There's a lot of grass growing around here.
You can eat the roots!
You can eat the roots of a lot of plants!
You never thought of that, did you?!
What have you brought back for us?
You!
In Tokyo you use your head to make money... but it's not worth a damn here!
Here you have to work, so get to work if you want to eat!
Hey!
College professor... writer... you have to go out searching regardless if it's raining or not!
A miracle won't fall out of the sky!
Just because it's raining doesn't mean that we stop working!
You don't mind getting wet when you're swimming, this shouldn't be any different!
Akiko... Akiko!
Akiko... it's mother.
I'm stopping.
Even if we fix the ship, we can't leave without food.
I'm going to look for some.
What are you looking at?
What are you doing?
What's it look like?
I wonder who stole the food from us the other night?
I suppose the ghost stole the key and got into the locker.
Oh, that. It's too bad
I couldn't hold on to him.
You liar!
Where did you get the idea to show us empty cans and claim some ghost did it?
We knew it was you who did it all along, but we wanted to stop another argument.
You're pretty good at finding fault in others, but you better watch your own steps.
What are you doing?
Don't worry.
I'm going to hunt down the monster that everyone saw.
Yoshida, you can't do that!
We don't know if it's a man!
He could be a survivor of the ship!
I hope that it is a man so I can have a talk with him.
I'll be very interested to hear what he says.
A man thinks strange things when he's out of his mind.
His reality may be more interesting than ours, and it wouldn't matter what he ate.
Yoshida!
We didn't get much after working all day.
But we worked hard and did as much as we could.
You're right.
Sakuda!
Knock before you come in.
I'll hold onto these.
We can't trust you.
You'll sleep with the rest of us tonight.
I sleep better when I'm alone.
You're going to work like everyone too!
Bastard!
Who in the world helped you when your brother was ill?
I put you in college and gave you a job in my company!
That's right.
I thought you were my friend, but you were just using me too!
Great!
Then how about these?
What eggs are those?
Turtle, the top of the line.
There's two for each, 14 in all.
You don't get any if you're empty-handed.
I don't care,
I'm not hungry anymore.
Hey, did you eat some of those mushrooms?
Well, I wonder...
Anyway, don't make anything for me.
Alright, I'll give you •10,000 each.
It's not enough.
Yesterday you charged •5000 each!
The market for eggs won't last for long.
Alright... •200,000, okay?
It's a gamble.
Will I be able to use it or not?
I'll do my best to get off this island, even if I have to kill everyone here to do it!
So that's your game, you bastard!
You bastard!
I'll kill you!
- Come on!
Sakuda!
Hey! Stop it!
- Stop it!
- Yoshida!
Stop it now!
He was with her.
Is this about jealousy?
We agreed to leave them alone.
You had no right to fight!
All of them want me.
I'll kill you all.
He's mad!
I ate some mushrooms. Now you know.
I read a long time ago that mexicans ate them in order to increase their perception and gain a sense of well being.
Don't move!
Japanese legends mention laughing mushrooms, so I'm in good company.
The people who gathered them danced in high spirits on the mountains and were in touch with the gods.
Matango, according to your thinking, means a person no longer human.
That's fine by me.
Because when I kill you,
I won't be commiting any crime.
I understand.
We won't stand in your way.
Do anything you like.
I will.
The truth is...
I like Akiko better than Mami, so after you're all dead...
Let me go!
Get up!
Move!
What's wrong?
Get in!
Hey!
What's the matter?
You're going to start living with the rest of us!
Sakuda!
It looks good.
You've done a lot to the yacht.
- Isn't it ready to go yet?
- Are you going to help?
Yes, in any way.
The truth is, can I talk to you?
What do you plan to do now that everything is different?
Hey, are you listening to me?
Yes.
There's 24 cans of food left.
Not much.
But for two people... maybe ten days.
Hey, how about the two of us leaving?
If we had potatoes and seaweed, we could last for weeks!
There's plenty of water.
I'm sure the two of us could stay alive for at least three weeks or so!
We could be found by a ship, or maybe find another island.
Get out!
I see.
The weak restraints of society disintegrate in the face of the will to survive in harsh circumstances.
The worse things get here, the worst we behave.
Is there a way to change everyone's feelings?
They made a mess here, huh ?
What happened, Kasai?
It's Sakuda!
He stole the canned food and left!
Damn!
Damn! He's gone!
I guess he didn't think any of us were worth saving.
I don't think he ever had a high opinion of us, but now that doesn't make any difference.
It's my turn to do something.
Mami, bring the girl over here.
- Bastard!
- No! Let go! Let me go!
I'm going to kill you both.
Start walking down the deck and don't try anything funny.
Teacher!
I wonder how many times I wrote something like this in my novels?
Yokoyama!
Get out of here!
- Kasai...
- You too!
Please, I beg you!
You wanted to be with him, get going!
I bet this didn't happen in your damn books!
Stop it!
It's been raining for a week now.
It must be it's raining season.
If you're right, we won't be able to live here very long.
Do you know anywhere else we can go?
We'll have to find a place.
Maybe we can find a cave.
Morai...
I'm finished... I can't go on.
Kasai, no matter how we feel, we can't give up.
How can we live if we do nothing?!
Stop it!
I wish you'd hurry and kill me.
I don't even have the courage to kill myself.
Don't say such things!
Anyway, relax for today.
He's right.
You rest here while we go out.
We're tough enough to survive, and so are you.
Let's go.
Mami!
You're still alive! How did you do it?
I haven't been hungry since I left.
Mami... help me! I beg you!
I've waited a long time for that... you begging for help.
Now you know how it feels to be desperate for help.
I'll help you... we'll go together.
The rainfall is making the mushrooms big and strong with each pitter-patter.
Where is the food?
A little further.
Walk this way.
It's delicious.
We should have eaten them sooner.
I should have told you that once you eat the mushrooms, you become a mushroom.
That's why all of the mirrors on the ship were removed.
But once you eat them, you can't stop.
Yoshida!
Kasai!
He's not here.
Teacher!
We're not beaten. We're not beaten!
Hey!
Sakuda!
Masoko Kasai, Kenji Morai,
Etsuro Yoshida,
Senzo Yokoyama,
Mami Sekimuchi, Akiko Soma...
These people are stranded on a deserted Island.
I went out on this ship to try and find some help, but I couldn't make it and died out at sea.
Captain Aoyuki Sakuda.
Damn!
I found the yacht.
The yacht?!
Then, Sakuda came back ?
Sakuda died at sea.
The yacht drifted back here.
Then no one has ever left this island, huh?
Is this all you could find this morning ?
I couldn't find anything !
Hey... we could eat these mushrooms.
You'd turn into a mushroom!
But...
- Mami and Kasai seem to...
- Idiot!
They're already half-mushroom!
That's alright.
If there's a way off this Island, perhaps it's the only way to live...
I shouldn't have done that.
Teacher... I can't do it!
I can't behave like you!
I can't! I can't do it!
I wish I were dead!
Akiko... we're not going to become mushrooms!
Teacher...!
We'll do it... right?
We'll spend the day... no... we'll get all the food that we can carry and get off this island!
Teacher!
Akiko!
Teacher!
Where are you? Akiko!
- Teacher!
- Akiko!
- Akiko!
- Teacher!
They're delicious! It's true!
Idiot! Let's go!
Teacher!
Then, the night came... and the morning came... and the night came again...
I don't remember when i was rescued.
But, now I'm sorry that I was.
If I was really in love with Akiko,
I should have eaten the mushrooms with her and become one.
At least we would have been together.
Isn't that it?
If I really wanted to live,
I shouldn't have been so stupid and eaten one.
With all the pain... all the suffering... all my sadness... would have disappeared by eating them!
How in the world can i face myself?!
No, no. You should consider yourself fortunate.
You were found and brought home.
Is that so?
Tokyo is not very different from that island.
People in the city are just as cruel, aren't they?
It's all the same.
I would have been happier on the island.
Transcript/Timing : aRKhaNe
EYES WITHOUT A FACE
The professor?
No, not yet.
I'll tell him, once he's finished.
Is not the greatest of man's new hopes that of physical rejuvenation?
This hope comes with the heterograft.
But the heterograft - in other words, the transplanting of living tissue or organs from one human being to another - has only been possible until now when both subjects in question were perfectly identical from a biological standpoint.
This means biologically modifying the nature of the host organism.
One method involves using heavy X-ray irradiation to destroy the antibodies that create resistance to the heterograft.
Unfortunately, this irradiation requires such a high level of intensity that no human being can survive it.
So we resort to exsanguination.
We drain evevy last drop of blood from the subject exposed to radiation.
- You just had a call, Professor.
- From whom?
The medico-legal -
You know, the morgue.
They want to see you right away.
- Oh, Professor, your lecture was so invigorating.
Thrilling, wasn't it, Carlo?
What a wonderful future you've shown us.
The future, madame, is something we should have started on long ago.
He's changed so much since his daughter vanished.
He says such strange things.
It's a strange business, but that's how it looks to me.
When Génessier's daughter vanished from the clinic, her face was an open wound.
True, the missing facial tissue confirms your theovy.
The car accident, the facial burns, the long immersion in the river.
And the rats, Doctor.
Don't forget the rats.
True.
Still, the drowning victim's description also fits that of Simone Tessot.
I called the Tessot girl's father down.
Something doesn't quite make sense.
What's odd is the body was fished out naked... in a man's coat.
Why should Génessier's daughter, distraught at her disfigurement, feel the need to strip naked in mid-winter before drowning herself?
And that large open wound where the face should be - it's strange.
The edges are as smooth as if someone had taken a scalpel to them.
Here he is.
Dr. Lherminier.
Detective Parot, of the Missing Persons Bureau.
I'm so sorvy we had to meet under such unfortunate circumstances.
Let's hear it.
This morning, bargemen fished a girl's body out of the Seine.
The time of drowning coincides with that of your daughter's disappearance.
The description also fits.
The damaged face...
Only the eyes are intact.
IDENTlFlCATlON ROOM
It's her.
Christiane.
Mr. Tessot is here, Doctor.
Tell him she's been identified beyond a doubt. It's not his daughter.
I called him in, in case...
Of course.
Excuse me, Professor.
I'm Henri Tessot.
I'm also here about my daughter.
The custodian said she was yours.
Are you really sure, sir?
Are you vevy sure?
Sadly, sir, only too sure.
It was such a shock when they phoned.
I thought I'd go mad.
It's been 1 0 days since we last saw Simone.
Something must have happened to her.
How odd I should have to comfort you.
You still have some hope, at least.
She's looking for a room.
With age, he looks more and more like his father.
Remember Génessier, the attorney?
No beanpole, either.
He sure has had a string of bad luck.
Losing his wife four years ago... now his daughter.
Paris, fame, fortune - what's it all add up to?
Who's the young man?
The girl's fiancé.
A doctor.
He works with the professor.
And the woman?
His secretavy, it seems.
A foreigner.
She looks deeply affected.
Go home, son.
No, let's go.
I like order.
Let's go!
I can't take any more of this.
Shut up!
TO MY BELOVED DAUGHTER
DR. GÉNESSlER'S VlLLA
NO ADMlTTANCE BEYOND THlS POlNT
Where did you find this?
I don't like your snooping around.
I have no time to explain it to you just now.
Sure, you see your name with a black border around it.
What can you possibly be imagining?
I don't have to imagine a thing.
I see horrible things.
I'm living them!
What have you done now?
What had to be done.
For your own good.
Always for your good, Christiane.
An obituavy notice.
Names were simply substituted.
Since that girl died after the operation,
I took an additional risk.
I made evevyone believe it was you.
Evevyone thinks you're dead.
They won't look any further.
They won't come around asking what happened.
Christiane, your mask!
Get into the habit of wearing it.
Where did you hide it?
The habit...
I only meant the habit of wearing it until we succeed.
Please don't cvy, darling.
I'll succeed, I promise you.
I don't believe it anymore.
There's no reason for you to doubt me.
I know my abilities, don't l?
You'll have a real face.
I promise you.
They've removed all the mirrors. but I can see my reflection in the glass when the windows are open.
There are lots of shiny surfaces... a knife blade, varnished wood...
My face frightens me.
My mask frightens me even more.
Have faith, Christiane.
Look at me.
Didn't he succeed with me?
But you had a face.
Damaged, maybe, but not destroyed like mine.
He's lying to me, because he knows it was his fault.
His fault?
It was a car wreck.
It was an accident.
Accident? He has to control evevyone, even on the road!
He drove like a lunatic.
The crash nearly killed me.
Why did he tvy so hard to save me?
I wish I were blind.
Or dead.
Who is this?
Say something!
I see you're alone, miss.
I have an extra ticket.
My friend didn't show up.
I'd be delighted, madame, but I planned to buy an inexpensive seat.
Don't worvy.
I'm not asking you to pay.
Sorvy I'm late.
My class ran overtime.
It's all right.
I was so anxious to give you the good news.
I found you a room.
I can't believe it! I'm so glad.
How can I ever thank you?
First take a look at the room.
I think you'll like it.
What neighborhood?
A lovely neighborhood.
The same for the young lady.
I'll drive you there.
The owners are friends.
It's surrounded by trees.
It seems vevy far.
I took the long way.
The traffic's heavy at this time of day.
That's the train that will take you to Paris.
In less than 20 minutes.
Don't you feel lonely, so far from your family?
A little, sometimes.
Those dogs...
How many are there?
You see?
You'll be well protected.
Miss Edna Grüberg.
Mr. Dormeuil.
Delighted.
Some port to refresh you after the drive?
No, thank you, sir.
I don't want to stay too long.
Come now, there's no hurvy.
I'll show you your room.
It looks out over the trees.
I'm sure you'll like it.
I don't know.
I have to think it over.
First, you really must see the room.
Of course, at night it's hard to judge.
It's not that, but the suburbs aren't vevy convenient for me.
What do you mean?
The suburbs are vevy convenient.
Vevy convenient.
Maybe so, but...
I don't want to get back to Paris too late tonight.
I'm meeting a friend.
I'll let you know tomorrow.
Tomorrow will be too late, my dear.
Open up, quickly.
I'll start after dinner.
This time...
I must tvy removing a larger section.
In one piece.
Not in sections.
Pencil.
Scalpel.
Wipe my brow.
Pencil.
Scalpel.
Forceps.
Here we go.
People are all the same.
They love pets when they're young.
When their pets grow up and eat too much, they abandon them in the woods.
I say you should never do things halfway.
Especially since the second half is by far the easiest part.
Calm down!
Shut up!
Did she eat normally?
Yes, vevy well.
She'd been wasting away.
She's happy this time.
She has faith.
Finally.
I showed her how nicely it's healing.
I changed the bandages.
It looks fine.
Much better than yesterday.
I'm so afraid.
Don't be.
I have faith this time too.
All I can do is hope.
If this were a success... God!
You couldn't put a price on it.
I've done so much wrong to perform this miracle.
I've done you a lot of wrong, too.
I know, but I'll never forget that I owe you my face.
I sometimes forget that myself.
With good reason.
There's hardly any trace now.
What have you decided about Edna?
Look after her. Feed her.
I'll decide later.
Edna! She's escaped!
That way.
No other details that come to mind?
Well, no.
Yes!
Edna said the woman always wore a thick pearl necklace.
See what I mean?
She wore it high around her neck, like a choker.
That doesn't help us much.
Please sign.
That'll be all, young lady.
Pretty, isn't she?
The same series of blue-eyed girls.
All students, all the same age, all the same type of beauty.
And all mysteriously missing.
This one's Swiss. You can imagine - the embassy, the phone calls...
Speaking of blue-eyed girls, what do I do with mine?
She was caught shoplifting.
Give her a stern lecture and let her go.
But get her address.
It might come in handy.
This is how you end up in prison.
It was the first time.
I don't know what got into me.
Next time, you'll go to court.
Let me have your address.
1 2 rue des Pyrénées, in the 20th arrondissement.
Now get lost.
I knew I would succeed.
To think that you didn't believe in me.
Now you have your lovely face.
Your real face.
You can start life over again.
True.
But I also have to come back to life for others.
How can l?
You can start by taking a trip, a long trip.
I'll get you new papers.
You can choose yourself a name.
Won't that be fun?
A new face, a new identity.
You're more beautiful than ever.
There's something angelic about you now.
Angelic?
I don't know about that.
When I look in a mirror,
I feel I'm looking at someone who looks like me, but seems to come from the Beyond, from the Beyond.
What about Jacques?
Obviously, that does pose a problem.
I'll explain it to him.
He loves you so much.
He'll be vevy happy.
Smile.
Smile.
Not too much.
Give him a shot of Pentothal.
I'll be right down.
Another emergency.
Will you come with me?
Sorvy, darling.
You're not wearing makeup, I hope?
Why?
No reason.
You have rosy cheeks, that's all.
See you tomorrow, darling.
I won't be long.
I'll come up to say good night.
You looked anxious examining her.
You're imagining things.
Why are you lying?
I've known you long enough to read your face.
Tell me the truth.
I've failed.
February 15.
February 20.
A week after healing, spots of pigmentation appear.
Later, palpation reveals small subcutaneous nodules.
On Day 12, necrosis of the graft tissue is apparent.
Day 20...
The first ulcerations and signs of rejection of the graft tissue.
The necrotic graft tissue must be removed.
With any old dog, everything's possible.
I 'll have to settle for this beastliness.
I 'm listening.
Say something.
This is infuriating!
Say something!
Jacques...
Are you mad?
Who were you calling?
No one.
Do you realize how reckless you're being?
I know.
The dead should keep quiet.
Then let me be dead for good.
I can't stand it anymore!
I don't dare look at myself.
I can't touch my face for fear of feeling the furrows and crevices in my skin.
It feels like rubber!
Calm down, my dear.
Trust in him.
I'm sure he'll succeed.
He never will.
He'll keep experimenting on me like one of his dogs.
A human guinea pig.
What a godsend for him!
You have no right to say that.
I want to die... please!
There are those injections he gives the dogs when things go wrong!
Stop talking like that!
You have to kill me.
I can't stand it anymore!
Come up, quickly!
I'm sure of it.
I heard Christiane's voice.
You thought you did.
Over the phone.
Did you mention it to Professor Génessier?
Of course. But he insists he identified his daughter's body.
I know. I was there.
What can I say?
Maybe it was a practical joke.
Still...
Well, Doctor, I deal in facts.
These files are filled with testimonies.
"I think that..."
"My feeling is that..."
A lot of vague descriptions. Here:
The red taxi picking up a girl.
The handsome woman with a pearl choker who was seen with the other girl.
A pearl choker?
That ring a bell?
Hold on.
Yes, it reminds me of someone.
But the other day you said
I was off the hook.
I hoped so, Miss Paulette Mérodon, but the case went higher up.
They say I was too easy on you.
So that means I'm done for.
Does that mean prison?
- There's the trial first.
The trial!
My parents will never get over it.
I've been thinking.
There may be a way to avoid all this.
Obviously, it would involve a great deal of discretion.
And some intelligence.
I can be vevy discreet.
And as for intelligence... if it's not too complicated.
You'll see.
You just have to do us a little favor.
- What do I have to do?
- Bleach your hair, for starters.
- You're kidding.
- That's not our style.
You have to be much blonder.
- It won't suit me.
- It doesn't matter.
Then a doctor will have you admitted to a clinic.
- But I'm not sick!
- You'll say you are.
Brief her on the details.
At the clinic, you'll complain of migraines.
I'll write it all down.
I'll give you a note for Dr. Gleize.
He'll give you a letter for Dr. Génessier.
Speaking.
What's that?
Wait, I'll write it down.
She can be admitted tomorrow morning.
Don't worvy.
I'll keep an eye on her.
Sure, it's just to check out a hunch.
If anything happens,
I'll let you know immediately.
You're coming along fine.
Just fine, Doctor.
The young lady was admitted this morning.
- The attending physician?
- Dr. Gleize.
Here's his letter.
You're in great pain?
Yes.
At times.
Do a funduscopy and an electroencephalogram today.
Are you going to shave my head?
I hope not, anyway.
That would be a shame.
An e... Iectro...encephalogram...
Don't be afraid.
We're friends.
Don't touch your forehead.
Tell me how many fingers
I'm holding up.
Three.
And now... how many?
Three.
No... two.
What do you think, Doctor?
I'm hopeful.
Tell me, Doctor.
Can you save him?
Of course we can.
Trust me.
Your prognosis?
And yours?
We agree.
Close your eyes.
Open your eyes.
That's it.
You can open your eyes.
You'll feel a slight electric shock.
It won't hurt.
Don't move.
Close.
Continue.
Open your eyes.
Close them.
Bring me the chart as soon as you've finished.
Nothing seems to be wrong with this Paulette Mérodon girl.
Bed 1 5 is hemorrhaging, sir.
Take care of it, Jacques.
Here's the chart, sir.
No abnormalities.
Release her tonight.
It will free up a bed.
We may have an emergency tonight.
- Do I give this form to you?
- That's right.
- May I make a call?
- To Paris?
What number?
Mom? It's Paulette.
Everything's fine.
I'm coming home.
See you in a bit.
What do I owe you?
- There's no charge.
How can I get back to Paris?
By bus. Turn left as you leave.
It's a 1 5-minute walk.
Can I give you a lift, miss?
I'm going your way.
With pleasure, madame.
Inspector Parot?
It's Jacques Vernon.
What's that, Doctor?
She left already?
They don't drag their feet at your clinic.
They sure don't keep them locked up.
What did I tell you?
But we'll check to make sure she got home safely.
Thanks for letting us know.
There are two men asking for you at the clinic.
You know I don't have time.
Tell them to come back tomorrow.
Sorvy to disturb you at this hour.
We want to know if Miss Paulette Mérodon checked out earlier.
How did you know she was checking out?
She called home to say she was on her way.
She never arrived.
So we came down to check.
Easy enough.
I gave the order to release the patient.
Has Paulette Mérodon been released?
- I'll see.
So, interested in this young lady, are you?
She's mixed up in a case we're on.
We wanted to talk to her tonight.
I have a feeling that you're a little late.
Paulette Mérodon. Here it is.
I remember now: a girl with blue eyes.
She made a call from here.
I told her where she could catch the bus.
You see?
I'm sorvy, but once they walk through those doors, my patients are no longer my responsibility.
I understand.
Again, sorvy to disturb you.
Don't mention it.
Well, good night, Professor.
Since you're leaving, Jacques, please show these gentlemen out.
I'm sorvy I wasted your time.
It's nothing.
We're used to following up bum leads.
And I put myself in your place.
You start getting ideas...
It's all these coincidences.
I wanted to put my mind at ease.
So we've put our mind at ease.
As for your heart,
I'm sure things will work out for you on that end.
You're young, Doctor.
You have your life ahead of you.
Put that down!
Why?
Turn it off!
- Who are you?
- Put that away. I'm not the enemy.
I don't know who the enemy is.
- What's your name?
- Jeff Nolan.
Watch your hands!
Get his wallet, Peggy.
- Sorry.
- That's all right.
- Hmm. You're an American?
- That's right.
- I'm Quinn Taggart. This is my wife, Peggy.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- I have to be careful with her along.
A farmer fired at us with a shotgun.
None of us know who our friends are.
- You seen anyone else?
- No one.
- Where did you come from?
- The south. It's the same all over.
- Do you know what's happened?
- No, I don't.
I took a plane up this morning for a shakedown flight... and when I went up everything was normal.
When I came down, everyone was dead.
I drove all day.
You're the first folks I've seen alive.
What's an American doing testing planes here?
It's sort of a joint project...
Britain, Canada and us.
A vertical-rising jet. I sit in for our team.
Where were you folks when everything stopped?
I was in a hospital... in an oxygen tent.
- What was the matter?
- I'm all right now.
But when nobody came, I got up by myself... and everyone was dead.
I think I'll just have a look round the back here.
Could I have a drink, please?
Hmm? Oh, sure.
What'll you have?
Oh, whiskey will be fine.
That's fine. Thank you.
Here's to you, Mrs. Taggart.
I'm not Mrs. Taggart.
He said it would be safer if we told people that.
- You're not married?
- Mm-mmm.
I was married. My husband died last year.
My name's Peggy Haddon.
- You never met Taggart before then.
- No.
Yes, I could do with a drink.
What's north of here?
Same as south... nothing.
- What are your plans?
- Well, there must be some people left... accidents like ourselves... and they'll head for the nearest town.
I thought I might hang around for a day or so and see if anyone showed up.
- Why?
- If we intend to survive,
- we'll need all the help we can get.
- You're kidding yourself, Nolan.
What happened earlier this morning, that was no accident.
Whoever did it has won the war.
All they've got to do is to move in and take over.
And then it's every man for himself.
Cheers.
Small world, my friend.
I thought you were dead!
Maybe... Maybe we all are.
Vi!
Vi, we've got company.
- I'm Ed... I'm Ed Otis.
- Jeff Nolan.
This is Vi... Violet Courtland.
Oh, I am pleased to see you.
Eddie and I didn't know what to do.
We were scared to death.
That's why we hid in the grocer's.
- I said, "At least we'd be able to eat."
- Let's get to the hotel.
- There's some others there too.
- Then it is just a local thing.
- I knew I was right.
- We'd better go. Come along.
- Here we are.
- Thank you. You're a dear.
Now then. Now Otis is buying.
What is your pleasure? Vi?
No more, Eddie love.
Can't I sweeten your tea for you, love?
Oh, it's not like you to turn down a drink. Oh, well. Cheers.
You know, I haven't a thing to wear.
I hope things don't go back to normal until I can get a proper wardrobe.
I don't think things will be normal for quite a while.
Then you do know something about it. I thought you did.
Let me ask you a question.
Where were you when all this happened?
At our company party...
25th anniversary of Chempex Limited.
Oh, and nothing happened to anyone else at the party?
You see, Vi and I, we kind of sneaked away.
She was feeling a bit under the weather.
So we went into one of the labs where they have a sofa there... in case any of the staff want to stay overnight.
- He didn't ask for your life history, love.
- In the morning they were gone.
- What kind of a lab?
- Oh, just a lab... cultures.
Well, then the air is treated to prevent contamination.
Well, I don't see what business this is of yours.
Just this: You and Otis were in a lab with treated ventilation.
Peggy was in a hospital under an oxygen tent.
I was in a plane on an altitude test. That...
- Where were you, Taggart?
- What you're trying to say is
- it was a gas attack, right?
- That's right, a gas attack.
Then why weren't we all killed when we came out into the air?
Well, it rained yesterday quite heavily.
If the gas was soluble in water then that could've saved us.
Oh, there was a funny smell... mushrooms.
Can't get anything else on this whole damn dial!
Otis, you're familiar with this area.
Did you ever hear that sound?
No.
It seems to be in all the bands at that frequency... even the television.
But who spread the gas?
Surely you could get them on that.
You're welcome to try, my dear lady.
I can't get any other country.
Not even a ship. Nothing.
- What's the matter?
- That's a lie! The ships are all right!
Now... Now don't... don't worry, Vi.
Don't worry.
- He's all right.
- Take your hands off me.
- Her son's at sea.
- Take your hands off me, Eddie!
What's the use of an army or an air force?
I haven't seen a plane since... since it happened.
Oh, they've come!
Oh, thank God! I'll go and tell them we're here. It's the air force.
Vi! Vi, come back here! Vi!
Stop!
Stop!
Please don't go away!
There's more of us over at the hotel.
Oh, please, don't go away.
Stop.
They're space suits.
I don't recognize 'em.
Stop! Stop!
We're over here. I'll show you.
You better stay here. Come on, Taggart.
She's dead.
- She's dead.
- I'll help you. Better get her inside.
You and I made a bargain.
Staying in a crowd's no good.
The sooner we get out of here the better.
I'm not going with you.
- You better park this.
- Is that an order, sir?
Over by the sports car.
I'm Jeff Nolan.
I'm Lorna Brainard, and this is my husband, Mel.
We better get to the hotel.
It's warmer inside.
- Nice car you're driving.
- Yeah. Found it.
Come on in by the fire.
Now look. We've got to get cracking.
I'm taking her to her mother's.
- Where's that?
- Liverpool.
- Where'd you come from yesterday?
- London.
I don't think you'll find it any different.
You think there's something out there?
We know there's something out there.
That's all we need... a cheeky kid and a pregnant girl.
They're probably the most important people on earth right now.
Where were you yesterday when it hit?
We don't even know what it was.
I just don't understand it.
- Look, what difference does it make?
- Well, I don't mind telling you.
- Lorna!
- Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of.
A year ago, Mel and I ran up to London. We got married.
We weren't doing very well. My mother wrote and told us we could go and stay with her... at least till the baby was born.
All right, if you want everyone to know our business.
We started north without any money.
The first night we, uh, broke into this air-raid shelter and slept there.
When we came out the next day, everyone was dead.
We think it was a gas attack.
This air-raid shelter was probably equipped to prevent air contamination...
- from fallout and radiation.
- I wouldn't know.
If it was a gas attack, who did it?
- How about that, Professor?
- We don't know.
We can't raise anybody or anything on the shortwave... and as far as we're concerned, it's no country on earth.
Oh, maybe those little men from Mars are back again.
They're real enough and big enough!
They killed Vi!
Look... You mean you've actually seen these things?
- Two men in space suits.
- Yeah, but at least they're men.
I emptied this in one of them, and he walked away.
Have you got men like that where you come from?
Well, why are we all standing here talking?
Vi's dead upstairs, and those things are still outside.
We're gonna get out of here.
You'd be better off if we stick together.
Otis, you know this area pretty well.
Where can we find some weapons to defend ourselves?
Well, there's a drill hall east of the village.
I don't know what you'll find there.
They use it mainly for meetings and civil defense and so on.
Let's go see what they have.
We'll go in my car.
- Now mind how you go, Lorna.
- Oh, dear.
That's it. Out you come.
Ooh.
- Well, maybe you could break the lock.
- No, we may need it.
- There must be another way in.
- Now let me try it.
Here.
That does it.
- Be my guest. It's worth a chance.
- Let's have a look around.
- Just a few cots.
- They're only drill rifles. No firing pins.
Mel, toss me a rifle.
You find any rifles?
No rifles, but they've got some workable automatics here.
- Here's some ammo.
- One, two, three, four. Testing.
- One, two, three, four. Testing.
- Mel. Mel.
- Otis. Otis, come on.
- I don't even know how to use these things.
- Just put the bullets in here like that.
- Hmm?
Close the breech.
Safety catch. Now you know.
Maybe you were right, Mel. Perhaps we should try and get back to Liverpool.
We can't walk out on them now, can we?
- Let's get back to the hotel.
- But, Mel, we...
- Hmm.
- Thank you.
And if you had gone back to the States, what would you have done?
Oh, I had a lot of problems that I thought were pretty important then.
I passed the age for flying, and the company wanted to give me a desk job-test planning.
- You didn't want a desk job?
- Mm-mmm. No, it wasn't that.
I just reached one of those turning points... where I thought I might take some inventory of myself.
Those problems were solved the hard way.
Ooh, time for the changing of the guard.
I better get Otis. See you both later.
Oh, honey.
Aw, there.
Somebody might get killed if you don't stay awake.
My doctor says I'm taking the same chance with this.
- Why drink if it's gonna kill ya?
- Well, I don't normally.
Just occasional drink at a party.
What difference does it make now?
Makes all the difference in the world.
You're needed now.
You know, I think you're whistling in the dark, Nolan.
We're never, never going to get out of this wretched village.
- Who's that?
- Taggart.
Getting a bit nippy out there.
- See anything?
- No, all quiet.
There's an old stable which might keep off some of the wind.
Well, I'll... I'll get my coat.
I'll take over for Mel.
Hmm.
I've got your dinner warming in the oven. I'll get it for you.
Good. I could use it.
- What's the matter with Otis?
- Oh, he's just plain scared.
Trying to drink himself to death.
- Can't really blame him.
- I can.
- As long as there's a chance.
- Maybe he thinks there isn't.
- Haven't you ever felt that way?
- No, and I don't think I ever will.
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Well, maybe I'm just lucky.
What have you got in there?
I'll show you.
- Mel!
- Where'd you get those?
At the bank. They've got a special today.
All you want for nothing. Help yourself.
Oh, Mel, you shouldn't take it... even if it isn't worth anything.
Why not?
Absolutely useless.
You can't eat it. You can't wear it.
You can't even write on it.
You know, it's funny.
Three days ago, I'd have done anything for that much money.
Anything... blown up a building, committed murder.
Oh, yes, I would. You don't know.
I wanted money so bad I could taste it.
This would've been for a house.
This would've been for a car.
Decent clothes for you. Clothes for me.
A telly, a washing machine, furniture... good furniture.
A place to go on a holiday. Cruise.
That was a week ago.
When I needed it, I couldn't get it.
What the devil's the use of it now?
Don't do that!
Wha...
- I... I don't understand.
- She came at me. I shot her. They all saw it.
You didn't have to shoot her! Aah! Aah!
Let him alone!
- You said that she was dead.
- She was.
She was alive enough tonight... except her eyes.
Well, what was the matter with them?
She hasn't got any eyes, just gray blobs.
She walked right at me.
She couldn't have been alive.
How do you think she got down here?
Anybody carry her?
She walked, my friend.
She was alive, all right.
When I shot her, she fell down and she bled just like anybody else.
- What do you think now, Professor?
- Hmm?
We better get back to the drill hall for tonight. We'll head south in the morning.
Those of us who want to go south.
- What do you want to do? Vote on it?
- Oh, forget the votes, Nolan.
And majority of rule, law and order.
There aren't any rules.
There aren't any orders.
We can make any kind of world we like.
What are we arguing for?
Let's get out of here.
All right. Mel, you and Otis get some food. We'll take all the cars.
- Peggy.
- Yes?
- Take care of Lorna, will you?
- Yes, I will.
It'll be daylight in about an hour or so.
Better all try and get some rest.
We'll leave as soon as we can.
- I'll finish out the watch.
- Let me help you with it.
- Suit yourself.
- How about me?
You better stay with your wife. Oh, Mel, take that radio back in the storage room, will you?
Sure.
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.
Which side do you want?
- You take the back.
- Anything you want, Professor.
Well, where is Jeff?
- What's the matter?
- Well, he's tucked away safe enough.
We're leaving. They're going south.
We're going north.
- No, we are not!
- Oh, yes, we are.
- You haven't killed him, have you?
- No, not yet.
One peep out of you, it could be arranged.
- Go to that car.
- But I...
Oh, get on!
- You all right, Jeff?
- I don't know.
Let's get you inside.
Ooh, my head.
Where do you think you're going?
You must get me a coat or a sweater.
I'm absolutely freezing.
Stay in that car.
I'll get you something further up.
Stay here.
Peggy!
Peggy!
Peggy.
Peggy.
Peggy! I have no time to play.
You're just making it rough on yourself.
- Ooh.
- There. Almost as good as new.
- Ooh.
- Thanks, Lorna.
Look, if you feel up to it,
I think we ought to get out of here.
I'm going back to the village first.
But they're miles away by now.
There's a chance they might have stopped there.
Get everybody ready to go, and if I'm not back in 30 minutes... leave without me.
Stay where you are! Stay!
What happened to Taggart?
He's gone.
It's a machine, a robot.
A few things begin to make sense.
Well, nothing makes any sense to me.
What about them?
What are they? What did they want?
They're human slaves to these machines.
Violet was dead, wasn't she?
This must be some sort of a shock attack.
They paralyze all the bodily functions and then reactivate them.
Sightless and mindless slaves.
What would they do if they got away?
I don't know. Without any mind or any intelligence at all, uh, they'd be worse than animals.
We'd better be the ones that get away.
Come on.
We'd better go in.
What if they've left?
I told them to go without me if I wasn't back in a half hour.
Oh, thank God you've come. Lorna needs you.
- Jeff, I don't know what to do.
- How is she?
- She's in a lot of pain.
- Jeff, you'd better get in here.
- What can I do?
- Come here.
Soon as the baby's born, we've gotta get out of here as fast as we can.
Mel, you and Otis drive down to the village... and get everything you think a baby might need.
- Be as quick as you can, but be careful.
- But, Jeff...
Relax, Mel. It isn't the first time this has happened.
Get me some safety pins. Get me some diapers.
Come on, Otis.
Oh, Jeff, I... I don't know anything about delivering a baby.
- You soon will.
- I wish I had your confidence.
I do too.
- How is she?
- Oh, she... she's coming along fine.
Oh. My goodness.
All that for one small baby.
You better keep it outside.
- Thanks for the help, Otis.
- All right.
I wouldn't go back there... not for all the tea in China.
Well, we can't stay here. It isn't safe.
Well, she can't be moved.
- Where she goes, the baby goes too, you know.
- I know. I know.
- She might be all right tomorrow.
- Tonight is what I'm worried about.
- Well... did you meet your daughter?
- Yeah. She snubbed me.
- Look, I don't know how to thank you.
- Oh.
When I look at that baby,
I should thank you for letting me help.
Hey, Jeff, did you see that thing in the village? It's some sort of machine.
Yeah. Yeah. We... We saw it.
- By the way, uh, where's Otis?
- Oh, he turned chicken.
I think he's in the storeroom.
Otis.
Otis. Where...
Otis. Come on. Wake up.
Otis. Come on, boy. Up and at 'em!
- Dead drunk.
- That's a great help.
Get the radio, Mel.
- I'll go check up on Lorna.
- All right, Peggy.
You didn't get a chance to hear it, Mel, but that's the same sound that the robots give off.
You mean, you think they're being directed by a transmitter?
You see, our own space program has robot devices designed for use on the moon and Mars.
They'll telecast their findings back to us and send pictures.
They don't look like, uh, spacemen, but it's the same principle.
Yeah. But how could they land a transmitter here?
I don't think they did. I think they're using one of ours as a booster.
Phew.
If we could wreck it, we could put them out of commission... at least round here.
Without the beam they'd just be dead hunks of machinery.
That's right, if the, uh, theory's correct.
And how do we find the transmitter?
With this and a piece of copper wire.
Well, you better pick up that walkie-talkie so we can keep in touch with Peggy.
Sure.
When you reach the lowest volume... the transmitter should be in a direct line with the plane of the antenna.
You take a reading and enter it on the map.
Then you drive a ways and take another reading.
Then a third about here.
Where the three lines intersect should be our transmitter. See how it's done?
Yes, it's the same way they used to track down amateur wireless sets...
- that were causing interference, isn't it?
- That's right.
- Jeff.
- Here. Let me have it.
- Jeff.
- We've just taken the first reading.
Everything all right there? Over.
It's quiet as a tomb here. Lorna's sleeping.
How long will you be, Jeff?
We'll be back as soon as we can.
Over and out.
If my readings are correct, the transmitter should be down that road.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Jeff.
Jeff!
Jeff.
- Jeff.
- Peggy. Peggy!
- The robots.
- What?
Peggy!
Let it go.
Taggart!
- Oh, Jeff!
- Peggy. Are you all right?
- Yes.
- I don't understand how you stopped them.
We blew up the transmission tower. Without the signal they're just so much machinery.
Do you think it's safe now?
- Maybe there are other towers.
- I don't know. Maybe there are.
But the main thing is we know how to stop them now, wherever they are.
Unless they try to use gas again.
There's always been that chance, and there always will be.
Let's see the baby. Come on.
Have you seen my baby daughter?
She slept through everything.
She's a very important young lady.
All of a sudden people mean something again.
When can we leave? We might find a doctor.
As soon as you're up to it. We'll drive to the airport and take one of the planes.
Whatever people are left will see the plane and... follow it south.
After a reign of hideous terror spanning more than a century the king of the "undead" was finally traced to his lair high in the Carpathian Mountains
Through the decades, many had sought to destroy him. All had failed.
Here, at last, was an adversary armed with sufficient knowledge of the ways of the vampire to bring about the final and absolute destruction.
This then was his fate.
Thousands had been enslaved by the obscene cult of vampirism.
Now, the fountainhead himself perished.
Only the memory remained of the most evil and terrible creature who ever set his seal on civilization.
There, there, Frau Koenig. Calm yourself.
Stay with me.
Frau Koenig. You know this is for the best!
The risk is too great to allow for any other way.
You do understand.
You must understand.
- Frau Koenig - tell me you agree.
- Hurry, Father. It'll be dark soon.
Please, Frau Koenig!
So be it. Then it must be done without your consent!
No, you mustn't do it! You can't!
She's my daughter! My baby! No!
Barbarians!
This is none of your concern!
Would I ride 50 km in this filthy weather if it were none of my concern?!
You shame the cloth you wear.
- We can't take any chances!
- Chances? What chances?!
This child died. You understand that
"Man of God"?
She died. Nothing more!
- You can't be sure.
- Of course I'm sure!
Take her to the churchyard.
She will be buried properly.
- I will read no service over her.
- I will bury her.
Now, do as I say.
Do as I say!
You're out of your jurisdiction.
I'll complain to the bishop.
You?! And tell him that I stopped you from performing an act of blasphemy?!
Or would you prefer that I told him?
Well... we have to be sure.
You are an idiot, Father.
Worse than that - you are a superstitious, frightened idiot!
Take care I don't have cause to ride this way again.
That's right - take it steady!
No time for a breather, though!
Very good.
- That's as much as I can manage.
- Very good, sir!
- Drinks all 'round again.
- Thank you, sir.
- He just bought drinks for everyone.
- I know.
- Charles is far too extravagant.
- A few shillings - we can afford it.
But that's not the point.
You've got your disapproving expression on again, Helen. What is it this time?
Well, I know it's none of my business, but that was the 3rd time you supplied everybody with drinks.
I know!
They don't appreciate it - they just think you're a fool.
Helen, what I do I do for my own satisfaction.
What about you, Alan - do you disapprove of your younger brother's generosity?
- I gave up approving of what you do.
- There's a sensible fellow.
You see Helen, Alan knows that I'm incorrigible.
He accepts the fact. Why don't you?
Foolishness is foolishness.
And now, as we all have to get up early, I suggest we go to bed.
I think that's a very good idea.
- What can I fetch you, Father?
- Mull me some claret.
It's not fit for a beast out there tonight.
Well, what are you all looking at?
Garlic - to keep out the Boogy man.
There is no Boogy man, and if there was this wouldn't keep him out.
Can't you get it into your thick skulls it's been over these past 10 years?
- May I warm myself by your fire?
- Of course.
- Charles, let him sit by the fire.
- I prefer to stand, thank you.
It's easier to warm one's self this way.
Ah! That's better.
Fortunately, my calling still allows me the luxury of a warm posterior.
One of the few pleaures left in life.
You strike me as a man who takes his pleasures seriously, Father.
I do, my son - indeed I do.
Pleasure in this life is important.
What are the alternatives?
Hellfire and brimstone.
No, I'm sure the warming of one's backside before an open fire and mulled claret aren't part of the Grand Design.
No, these are earthly pleasures we enjoy while one is able.
And what, may I ask, are four charming
English people doing in the Carpathians?
My name is Charles Kent.
This is my wife Diana, my brother Alan and his wife Helen.
Father Sandor, Abbott of Kleinberg at your service.
Please, be seated.
Father...
Kleinburg must be a dangerous journey for you to go armed like this.
Another of my earthly vices.
Each time I leave the monastery,
I bring this with me.
The bretheren think it's a bundle of prayer books for the heathen.
I'm sure they truly believe that the venison I bring home drops dead by the divine Will of God.
- You too are hunting?
- No, no. Some climbing, some sightseeing.
- Travel broadens the mind.
- Admirable.
But I question your choice of locale. You won't have your mind broadened by this lot.
You don't seem to have a very high opinion of your flock.
Not mine - dear me, no.
I wouldn't tolerate them.
I wouldn't tolerate them!
You will find things very different in Kleinberg
I hope you will visit us there.
You can stay at the monastery.
- The brothers will make you very welcome.
- Thank you Father - that's a fine idea.
Our programme won't allow for it.
Tomorrow, we go to Carlsbad.
Well, I suppose we could change our plans.
I suggest that you do so.
It's very kind of you to invite us, but...
...as my wife points out, we do have our programme to stick to.
I don't care whether you go to Kleinberg or not,
I'm just saying you shouldn't go to Carlsbad.
- I've heard it's very beautiful.
- So is a drop of belladonna.
Deadly nightshade.
- We're all experienced climbers, Father.
- Climbing's got nothing to do with it.
You may think me an eccentric old cleric and not much credit to my cloth.
Perhaps I enjoy shocking people's susceptibilities, but I can be serious. and when I tell you not to go to Carlsbad, I want you to take note.
- Landlord?
- Yes, Father?
Have my horse brought 'round.
Well, I'm delighted to have met you all.
And if you disregard my advice, at least stay well clear of the castle.
Castle? But there's no castle marked on the map.
Because it is not on the map doesn't mean it does not exist.
Stay away from it.
Ladies.
- Very strange.
- The Father made a mistake.
If there was a castle, it would be marked.
Well, right or wrong - we'll find out tomorrow.
I don't care how much money you give me. I ain't going to go no further.
Don't be ridiculous. You contracted to drive us to Carlsbad.
You can walk. It's bare 2 kilometers.
- Walk?! You must be mad!
- You're the ones that are mad.
- Come on, man - it'll be dark soon.
- Aye, it will. That's why I'll go no further.
It's not our fault that you slipped a wheel and we're 4 hours late.
I'm not saying it is. I'm just saying I'll go no further.
Look. Up there. The castle.
- What's that place?
- What place?
- The castle.
- I don't see no castle.
That's because you're not looking, idiot!
Alright - you've had enough argument. Get the women out!
Now! Get 'em out!
You'd better do as he says.
Leave it, Charles. He's a highway robber. He just wants our luggage.
I'll be back here 2 hours after dawn tomorrow.
If any of you are here then,
I'll take you on to Carlsbad.
Hyah!
He wasn't a robber. We should be grateful for small mercies.
- Why did he say he'd be back after dawn?
- He's frightened of the dark.
- You don't mean that.
- Of course not.
- He should be reported to the authorities.
- We're not in England now, Helen.
I doubt that there are any authorities to report him to.
And it wouldn't help us if there were, would it?
Why wouldn't he look at that place?
Well, Sandor was right in any event.
But why does everyone else deny the existance of the place? Even the map?
- Maybe we could stay there.
- No - let's stay away from there.
I agree with you.
Well - there's the alternative.
I prefer that.
So would I.
Very well - let's take a look.
There's no driver!
- Can we stop it?
- We can try.
- Charles, be careful!
- Watch it, Charles!
Well - you're the most welcome horses I've ever seen. Both of you.
This is a bit strange, isn't it?
Haven't you heard? Never look a gift horse in the mouth.
Especially when there are two with a coach.
- Alan's right. The whole thing is strange.
- I agree.
Well, all I can see is, we won't have to spend the night in that hut.
All aboard?
- Alright.
- Let's see to the luggage.
Helen, hold the horses, will you?
Diana, you hold them.
Alright, Darling.
- Carlsbad?
- Carlsbad.
Gitup!
Whoa! Whoa! Come 'round!
They're taking the wrong road!
Come back! Whoa! Whoa!
- What's wrong?!
- They're going the wrong way!
I can't turn them!
Come back! Whoa!
Come back! Whoa! Whoa!
Alright, my beauties, you're calling the tune!
He can't control them!
Well!
Let's see if your master is as hospitable as you are.
What do you think?
I don't think they're horses at all, but St Bernards in disguise rescuing travelers who are stranded at the crossroads.
We made enough noise arriving - you'd think somebody would come out if not to welcome us, to chase us away.
Well, it's no good standing here debating the situation.
Let's pay our respects.
Ladies?
No, Charles.
Surely, it can't be as bad as spending the night in that hut.
It's eerie.
Well, let's find out just how eerie.
It's open.
Well?
Hello?!
Anybody there?!
You're right Helen - it is a bit eerie.
- I don't think we should go in.
- We've got to now. Come on!
Hey! Stop!
- What now?
- I don't know.
If you'd listened to me back at the crossroads we wouldn't be in this state now.
If we'd listened to you, Helen, we'd still be in England.
- Would that be bad?
- You wanted to broaden your mind!
I suppose you call this educational, now?
I'm sure it would be very educational if we knew what it was all about.
Stop it, both of you.
I'm sorry, Helen.
Look at this!
What is it, Darling?
The table is set for four persons.
Don't you see? First the coach brings us to the castle, and now the dinner table.
We're expected.
- Ridiculous. How could that be?
- I don't know - but we are.
No, Alan's right, Darling.
Any moment now, four perfectly normal, respectible people are going to come down those stairs for dinner.
Well, if there's anybody up there, they must be stone deaf.
There's one way to find out.
No!
No. We can't stay here.
We must leave this place now.
- Steady, Darling. It's alright.
- It isn't!
It isn't.
Come... sit down.
Charles!
- Charles, you mustn't go upstairs.
- He's only going to see if anyone's home.
I'll be back before you know it.
Charles!
It'll be alright, Helen. You'll see.
Hello?!
Alan!
Come up here, will you?
- Someone's bedroom.
- Come here.
Whose cases are these?
They're yours, aren't they?
I'm going to look next door.
Alan!
Our things are in there.
Sorry if I startled the lady, sir.
It was unintentional.
Why didn't you make your presence known sooner?
I was unpacking your cases.
I trust the rooms are satisfactory.
Yes, admirable. But I don't understand - none of us do.
My master's hospitality is renowned.
- But...
- If you are ready, I will serve dinner now.
Thank you, sir.
- I still don't understand it.
- Please, let's leave here.
- Dinner sounds like a splendid idea.
- I agree.
- Diana, you can't.
- But why not?
Ten minutes ago we were stranded in the cold miles away from anywhere.
Now we're warm - we're going to be fed,
If that man's master is anything like I think he is, we're going to be entertained as well.
Yes, Diana's right. Let's get down.
What's your name?
Klove, sir.
Well, Klove, isn't your master joining us for dinner?
No, sir. I'm afraid not.
- Is he indisposed?
- He's dead.
I'm sorry if we appear a little dense - perhaps you could explain.
- Explain, sir?
- Yes, you seem to have expected us.
This dinner, our rooms, the carriage, everything.
Well sir, my master is dead, but instructions were left that the castle should always be ready to receive guests.
- I am merely carrying out his wishes.
- I see.
Who was your master?
His name was Count Dracula.
An old and distinguished famlly.
That is the coat of arms, over the fireplace.
Does no one hold the title now?
My master died without issue, sir...
...in the accepted sense of the term.
Now if you will excuse me.
The soup's delicious.
What a marvelous man he must have been, to keep the castle always ready for travelers
- Perhaps we'll get a bill tomorrow.
- No, surely not.
No, no. I didn't mean it.
If only that coachman knew it, he did us a favor when he deserted us.
I think it's frightening.
The unexplained is always a little frightening.
Even you must admit, this is preferable to spending the night in a woodcutter's hut.
I'm still frightened.
I don't know why.
I'm just frightened.
I admit it was a little strange at first, dear, but now it's all been explained.
Father Sandor tried to warn us about this place.
- Helen.
- He tried to warn us!
That's because he wanted us to go and visit him in Kleinberg.
It's my belief that we're all extremely lucky.
Now, I think we should take advantage of the late Count's hospitality, and enjoy ourselves!
Here's to him.
May he rest in peace.
- Count Dracula!
- Count Dracula!
- Guess who.
- Horace Peabody.
Right first time.
Did you enjoy your port, cigars, and man's talk?
No, not very much, but then it takes female company for me to...
- Who is Horace Peabody?
- An old beau of mine.
Before your time, Darling.
There was no before my time.
You were a schoolgirl in pigtails.
Even schoolgirls have their moments.
Hurry up. I'm cold.
- Is the bed comfortable?
- Not really. Lumpy.
Maybe you've got Horace Peabody in there somewhere.
He was far too much of a gentleman.
It is lumpy.
Fine, that'll give Helen something else to complain about.
Funny about Helen.
Darling, she's always the same - 2 miles outside London and nothing is ever right.
She wasn't complaining.
She really was frightened.
- She hardly touched her dinner.
- It was a damn fine dinner, too.
Did you notice how she kept looking over her shoulder all the time?
Klove frightened the life out of her.
He's not a particularly comforting person to have around, I'll grant you.
I'm glad you noticed it.
I thought it was just Helen and I.
What was it about him?
I don't know. I suppose he's a bit like the castle - sort of dusty.
He's not particularly clean, either.
- You suppose he cooked the dinner?
- I haven't the faintest idea, Darling.
The place isn't exactly swarming with servants, is it?
Yes, Klove?
Is there anything further you or Madam require, sir?
No, thanks.
Then I wish you goodnight.
- He's a strange one.
- He's frightening.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
I can't get through to any of you that it is frightening. Everything about this place is evil!
You're tired dear. We've all had a most trying day.
It's not that.
This whole situation is like a bad dream.
I expect any moment to wake up and find it didn't happen!
- Oh, Helen.
- It's true!
The worst part of it is that
I'm the only one that can see it.
- Oh, Alan, let's go. Please!
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I mean it!
- I know you do.
You'll forget about all of this in the morning. You'll see.
There'll be no morning for us.
What's the matter?
- You called me.
- No. Go to sleep.
- You said "Helen".
- I did not.
- Something called my name.
- You dreamt it.
Alan... what is it?
Well?
- It's Klove.
- Klove?
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.
Seems as if he was pulling a trunk down the corridor.
- Let's find out.
- Alan!
Don't leave me.
I'll only be a moment.
Lock the door.
Madam... your husband.
Will you come quickly?
I'll wake the others.
Klove?!
Klove!
- Have you found them?
- No.
- All their luggage is gone.
- They must be here somewhere.
We've looked everywhere.
- I want to leave.
- Darling, we can't leave without them.
Please, Charles. I'm frightened.
Alright, come on.
- No, Charles, I won't allow it.
- Darling, I've got to go back there.
At least go to the village first and get help.
What help? As far as the villagers are concered, that castle doesn't exist.
- Then, I'm coming with you.
- No. I want no argument.
You stay here, I go to the castle.
That's all there is to it!
Is that clear?
Alright.
It's 2:30 now.
I'll be back before 6:30.
- It's dark by then!
- You're not frightened of the dark.
- I am here.
- You'll be quite safe in there, Darling.
I'll try to be back soon.
Take care.
Yes, of course I'll take care.
Klove?!
I hope I haven't startled you, Ma'am.
Klove - what are you doing here?
Your husband sent me to fetch you in the carriage, Ma'am.
- Why?
- He will explain everything to you.
He's been waiting for you, Diana.
He's been waiting for you.
Helen!
Where is Charles?
There's something wrong, isn't there?
- Where is Alan?
- Nothing's wrong.
Come, sister.
Where's Charles?
You don't need Charles.
Stop!
Let her go!
Dear Charles. Let me kiss you.
- Charles!
- Diana! Get away!
Charles!
Diana!
Charles!
I warned you not to go anywhere near the castle, Mr Kent.
I read about vampires years ago.
I always thought it was the product of an over-fertile imagination.
Would that it were, Mr Kent.
Here in the Carpathian Mountains, vampirism was an undisputed fact.
And the fountainhead of this obscene cult was Dracula himself.
I hoped we had seen the last of him.
The last record we have of him is...
...here it is... ten years ago.
From what you tell me, it was your unfortunate brother who provided the life force for his resurrection.
Then...
...I must kill him.
Not kill... he is already dead.
He is "undead", Mr Kent.
He can be destroyed, but not killed.
- How... destroyed?
- There are a number of ways.
He can be traced to his resting place during the daylight hours and there staked through the heart.
He can be exposed to the direct rays of the sun.
Running water will drown him.
The cross will burn him.
He is not invulnerable.
You make it sound comparatively simple.
To skin a cat - first catch it.
It is not simple.
To the contrary, it is a difficult and dangerous undertaking.
You see, there are people who help him.
Apparently normal human beings. who are not vampires themselves but who, for reasons we don't understand are in his power.
This Klove is such a man - spending his life at the castle, waiting for such an opportunity as you gave him last night...
...a chance to resurrect his master.
- How is she?
- Admirable. Another 24 hours and she'll be as good as new.
Ludwig would like to see you, Father.
Come with me Mr Kent.
Ludwig should interest you.
He was a traveler, like yourself.
I found him one night near Castle Dracula.
Something he had seen or heard unhinged his mind.
He lost his memory completely.
We brought him here. And here he has remained these past 12 years.
Oh, he's a contented enough soul, and a brilliant craftsman.
- Good day, my son.
- Good day, Father.
- What can I do to help you?
- I seek shelter for the night.
I'm sorry, my son, but I have orders to let no one in tonight.
You are welcome to rest here.
I'll have the kitchen send you out some food.
Thank you, Father.
Exquisite. Magnificent.
Fly away, Peter. Fly away, Paul.
Flies, Ludwig?
A small aperitif, Father Sandor.
It will soon be dinner.
- You wanted to see me?
- I finished the cover of the third folio.
I wanted your opinion on it.
Is it exquisite or merely magnificent?
- Exquisite, eh, Mr Kent?
- Beautiful.
Good.
You may go now!
- Goodbye, Ludwig.
- Yes, I'll send for you when I want you again.
- Why the security?
- He's a harmless enough soul, but he has been known to erupt.
Come, we have things to discuss.
We are in agreement, then.
As soon as your wife has recovered sufficiently we will send her home to England.
Then, you and I will do what has to be done.
We will pull that castle down stone by stone if necessary.
We will find him wherever he is.
I still don't see why we can't start immediately.
No, it is better to wait until
Mrs. Kent is safely away.
Last night Dracula was robbed of his prey - your wife.
He has seen her and touched her.
He considers that she belongs to him already.
He will want her badly.
- He won't come here?
- It is unlikely.
And even if he does, he will not get in.
What the inhabitants here don't realize is that a vampire cannot cross a threshhold unless he is invited by someone already inside.
And if he is, all the garlic flowers in the world won't keep him out.
Yes, master, yes.
Darling, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.
- Are you alright?
- Yes, of course.
You're the one we have to worry about.
The important thing is to get you well enough to go home.
Home... that sounds marvelous.
When do we leave?
I won't be coming - not just yet.
Why not?
There's something I have to do here first.
Oh, Charles - you're not going back to that castle.
- I have to, Darling.
- No you don't!
Please Charles, promise me that you won't.
- We'll talk about it in the morning.
- No... now.
- Darling.
- I'm not leaving here unless it's with you.
Now Mrs Kent, no more talking.
It's important that you rest.
Father, you tell him. It's madness to go back to that place.
I think your husband is right, my dear.
We'll talk about it in the morning.
Now, Mr Kent, please.
Diana!
Good night.
Charles!
She'll be alright in the morning.
She'll understand what has to be done.
I hope you're right.
I think you will find everything you need. Goodnight, my son.
- Goodnight, Father, and thank you.
- God be with you.
Diana!
- Helen.
- Please let me in. It's cold out here.
So cold.
Everything is alright now.
I got away from him.
Oh, please, Diana, let me in.
I'm freezing.
Darling, what's wrong?
What's wrong?
Alright. Alright.
What happened?!
Tell me, what happened?!
Get her down.
Hold out her hand.
For pity's sake, enough!
Brother Mark.
Bring some salve and bandages.
- Well?
- We were just in time.
Are there any strangers in the monastery?
Only a tinker, Father. He's spending the night outside the main gate.
Why wasn't I told this before?!
Spread some salve on her wrist, bandage it and remain with her.
Come with me, Mr Kent.
She'll be alright now. Come!
That will prevent them from returning here at daylight.
If we haven't caught them by that time, they will be exposed to the sun and destroyed.
We have caught the woman.
She was hiding in the stables.
- Dracula?
- No.
Take her to Ludwig's cell.
If you wish to see the destruction of the horror spawned by Count Dracula come with me. But I warn you - it is not a sight for the sqeamish.
Take Ludwig out.
Go with Father Peter, Ludwig.
It will be alright.
Now, bear in mind that this woman is not your sister-in-law.
She's dead. This is a shell, and what it contains is pure evil.
When we destroy it, we destroy only the evil.
Mr Kent... have a look.
Ludwig? What are you doing out of your room?
My room is being used for most important matters.
Father Sandor sends his compliments, Madam.
Would you do him the honor of joining him in the study?
- But...
- Everything is under control, Brother.
There's no cause for concern.
Diana!
Diana!
Diana!
No!
- Horses! Quickly!
- We will go after them.
- But my wife!
- Not in panic!
Come.
Take him back to his cell.
Come, Mr Kent.
Come along now, Ludwig.
Come along. Come with us.
He will head for the castle.
Once there, he will be safe, and your wife will be lost forever.
We must stop them before he gets there.
- It's more than a day's ride.
- I know. This is to our advantage.
How?
It will be daylight soon. Already he will be thinking of returning to his coffin.
Your wife will be safe until sunset tomorrow.
Here.
It would be better if you kept it.
It's your rifle. You're used to it.
No. We will not be shooting animals, Mr Kent. Klove is a human being.
I may bend the laws of my office at times, but there is a limit to what even I will do.
Come. We must saddle the horses.
We've a hard day's ride ahead of us.
He's making for the castle.
- Will we be in time?
- We've got to be.
- We'll never make it!
- No.
We'll cut across country!
That's far enough!
Get down from there!
Get out of the way!
Come on Mr Kent!
Hurry, Mr Kent!
Diana!
God be praised.
No! You look after her.
I'll take care of him.
You must hurry! The light's going!
It's too late, Kent!
Get away from there!
It's too late!
- Why don't you shoot him?
- It would do no good, my dear.
Running water.
Mitsuki, don't cry.
He's our only son.
He's just a boy.
Remember, Mitsuki, you haven't lost a son, you've won a daugther.
My only daugter, and I hope the boy will be a good husband to her.
I'm sure he will.
Dry your tears.
And when will the lovely
Soon-a be married?
I don't know, but I'm in no particular hurry, thank you.
I hear rumors about you and Il-woo.
That would be like falling in love with a computer, almost.
Excuse me.
I must be going.
Oh, must you?
We were expecting you for lunch.
Another time.
Il-woo, I'm afraid I've been rater nasty to you.
You couldn't be.
I do have a lot of research still to do, tought.
Te familiar apology of te dedicated scienthist.
But you have to draw te line somewere, you know.
Your father was equally dedicated, but he died of overwork.
Neverteless, I must go.
Excuse me.
He's going to be as famous as is father was.
Why do scienthists act as tough the only important work in the world is what they're up to?
All he ever talks to me about... is is stupid work.
And I must say I don't get alf of it.
I think he makes it up on is own.
But he doesn't know I'm not always impressed by scienthists anyway.
I think that boy's going to go crazy, and very soon.
Soona, don't be unkind.
Il-woo's very talented.
One of these days you're going to see
Il-woo at te head of his profession.
He's a wonderfully gifted lad.
Why must you always stand up for him like that?
Your father's decided to like Il-woo, just in case
- He becomes one of the family later.
- Oh, mother.
- Shall we go eat?
- Yes, let's.
Good idea.
I wonder why little Ico didn't come?
Oh, well, you know how children are.
He's forgetful, all right.
All boys are.
But he wanted to show us that little surprise he had for us.
He will.
What is it?
I don't know.
My skin, it's hitching so.
Hum?
What the...
Well, this is one hell of a way to start a honeymoon.
- What got into you two?
- I don't know.
This light started to shine on us and we just started to hitch all over.
- You started to hitch?
- From over there.
- I think I know what's going on.
- Well, what?
- Come on out.
- Who are you talking to?
Come out of there, Ico!
- Well, I'll be...
- Ico, What a surprise.
What have you got behind your back, young man?
- It's nothing.
- Here, give that to me.
- What is it?
- Just a toy.
Hey, you two are going to be late.
You'd better hurry.
You're right. Let's go.
Bye.
Monster.
Have fun.
Come on, Ico.
- Where'd you get that, as if I didn't know?
- In your lab, as if you didn't know.
Didn't your mother ever teach you not to shoplift?
Sure, but it was my surprise wedding gift.
Well, quite a surprise.
Don't you realize they almost scratched temselves to death?
Yeah, but you gotta admit it was kinda funny.
Yes, Ico, I guess it was.
My boy, that ligth ray is experimental.
That's What I thougt it was, Il-woo, so I experimented.
Now you can put in your notebook that it works perfectly on newlyweds.
Thank you, Einstein, but I was serious.
You mustn't play around.
We've found out that the ligth ray causes severe hitcing.
But there can be side effects.
Understand?
We've been investigating it.
I'll bet you never realized you could harm your sister and her new husband.
So, from now on, just leave things where you find them, all right?
All right.
All right.
Over there.
- There.
- Now, come here.
Look, you can play with these instead.
Hey, those are terrific.
I must've dozed.
Boy, I'm really tired tonigth.
You can sleep afterwards.
You're not going to be a nagging wife, now, are you, my dear?
I bore you already.
Looks like our marriage is doomed.
No, that happens wenever I get married.
I get tense.
You were smiling.
And, really, I don't know ow you can be tense and smile all at one time.
It's easy at weddings.
Especially when marrying the world's loveliest girl.
Let's not talk politics now.
Now, sweeheart...
If that subject doesn't interest you, this might.
That's just my father at the control center.
I'm sure he thinks he's very funny.
- Yes, sir?
- This is headquarters, son.
Do you need me, sir?
That's right, and immediately,
I'm afraid.
Reconnaissance job, my boy.
A rocket is being readied.
What is it all about, sir?
There seems to be... some kind of nuclear test somewere in te Middle East.
We want a monitor on it.
We'll need you here within an hour.
Very well, sir.
Please get someone else, can't you?
He's supposed to be here tonight.
I'm sorry, dear. It's a pity.
He's te only one who can handle it.
It'll last two days.
We'll get him a two-week vacation when he returns, all right?
I guess so.
There's apparently no choice.
Nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two,
one, zero l'am now over the target area.
Good. fire retro-stabilizers and commence reconnaissance.
Would you come here, sir?
I can't get trough to te capsule.
Something's gone wrong with the radio.
Capsule, capsule, come in, capsule.
Hello?
Come in, please.
Control tower, come in, please come in.
- Come in, capsule. Capsule...
- Oh, please, can't you do anything?
We're doing all we can, dear.
Capsule, capsule...
Here is the latest news bulletin
reports from korea's rocket control center indicate
that after a perfect takeoff and a flawless entry into orbit,
our rocket number 7-x,
at present on a routine reconnaissance flight,
has developed some radio trouble
this, however, is not causing too much worry
and the experts are in hopes of clearing it ap momentarily
Capsule, capsule, capsule, come in.
Come in, please. Capsule, come in.
Capsule, come in.
What do you think is the matter with him?
Where is he?
If it's only someting wrong with is radio, don't worry too much.
He'll have little difficulty landing the craft.
Te only problem will be that we won't know where.
He migth even land in the ocean.
We'll do all we can.
Control tower, do you read me?
Over
Control tower, come in, please.
Reading you loud and clear, capsule.
Go ahead, capsule.
Capsule, we read you.
Where've you been all this time?
Listen.
I'm so glad he got through.
Prepare rocket for landing.
Use manual de-orbiting.
Position yourself with the rear stabilizers.
Time retro-rockets for landing zone two.
Roger, re-entry at landing zone two.
Very unusual, an earthquake in that area.
An earthquake?
I thought they were just in Japan.
Not true, Ico.
In any case, we do have a large earth movement here.
Sir, there's someting a bit unusual going on here.
Would you take a look, please?
Sir, we have triangalated...
the epicenter of the earthquake.
The epicenter is shifting.
It's moving rapidly in a straight line.
How?
And if we extend this line in the direction of movement,
it points directly to the heart of Korea. we have no choice but to call an alert.
Get me H-Two.
Capsule, come in!
This is capsule.
Land your craft immediately.
Change perspective for zone 10.
Oh, look! There!
He's coming down.
He made it. It's all right.
Let's go.
A perfect landing.
- That's te best one yet, I think.
- Yes, it was.
We'd better get over there.
B Post, B Post, this is 6-M.
This is 6-M.
The capsule is on te ground.
The landing was successful.
Welcome. Welcome.
- Good landing.
- Congratulations.
Oh, darling.
I'm here, too.
I think you were just wonderful.
Te eartquake's moving, sir.
I thought so.
In what direction?
- To te norteast.
- Well, now what?
It looks like everyone is agreed on one important point, gentlemen, and that is that this earthquake, or earth movement, is defying every natural law that man knows.
It seems to me you're exaggerating. this is nothing more than a tremor.
I don't agree with you.
We ave an earth movement.
We don't know how it started, and we don't know how to stop it.
I hope, gentlemen, you will allow me a word.
I admit that my point of view is strictly military.
Consequently,
I believe in having cards on the table.
The moment for teorizing, I think, is over now.
We're positive of one thing only.
There's an earthquake heading towards the center of our country.
That's why we're here.
And when this heartquake gets here, it's going to bring disaster.
That is, unless we can get ourselves ready for it.
Well, there you have it, as clear as day.
Now, What are we going to do about it?
A clear statement.
However, I greatly fear that science cannot help.
We're as mystified as everybody.
But we cannot just sit and wait.
Now, we must start in preparing.
At least we have a few hours' time to try to minimize te danger, and the damage that we know are bound to occur soon.
We must declare a state of emergency and martial law.
I'm sure you're right, General.
So we'll begin all preparations and be ready for trouble, but I think it better that we call no alert until we're sure te earthquake will it.
- This came trough just now, sir.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen, the United Nations as just announced that they will help us.
An expert team of scientists as been ordered to come to Korea.
They sould be here within a few hours.
It's Hwangae.
According to the board, the heartquake is now hitting close to te Hwangae province.
There's no time for speaches.
Well, it's beginning to look like you were right, General.
I autorize you to impose martial law immediately.
This is an emergency announcement.
this is an emergency announcement.
An earthqaake is imminent in this area.
Stop whatever you are doing and return home.
Martial law has been declared.
Return to your homes at once.
I repeat, return to your homes at once.
listen to your radio for further instructions.
- An earthqake will be hitting this area.
- An earthquake.
We'd better go.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is an emergency announcement.
An earthqaake is expected in this area.
Do not panic repeat, do not panic.
Mother, I'm so scared.
I know. Just don't forget your father.
He'll find something.
- There. Do you see it?
- Another degree. More.
Down one, and across...
About five.
Hurry! Hurry up!
What could that thing have been?
What does it want?
Where'll it it next?
It migth stop before it gets any closer.
That would be very pleasant, but don't count on it.
You know, this earthquake reminds me of someting I heard a long time ago.
When I was a child, my grandparents used to tell me fables about a monster.
He was connected with earthquakes.
- Yongary?
- That's te one.
Sir, we found this man three miles from the earthquake center.
Look, please...
- What's that?
- It's Yongary.
The mysterious moving earthquake...
has been identified as being caused by a gigantic reptile
this monster, Yongary, has already been responsible
for several deaths and great damages
all citizens are advised to stay in their homes
our armed forces are making
all necessary preparations to deal with the monster
This is Patrol Six.
Come in.
You see anything over there?
Not yet.
At ease, men.
- Anything to report?
- No, sir.
Headquarters. Headquarters.
This is Car Two. Do you read me?
There's a strange disturbance here at Inwang.
I don't understand what's going on.
An explosion at high altitude.
The mountain is going to blow up!
It looks like Yongary wasn't a myth after all.
So, General, I suggest you get a few tanks over tere.
Yongary's coming out!
So, we must now alter all our plans and evacuate.
I want to see every single living human out of this town by sun up tomorrow morning.
And furthermore,
I want several brigades out on te streets.
They're going to aid the people.
And the rest of the army on tank maneuvers.
Good. I think we have three tank divisions available.
The monster yongary has been reported in the Inwang area.
All citizens are ordered to evacuate the city.
Number 13!
Battalion, withdraw tanks!
Il-woo, where are you going?
Il-woo, What are you going to do?
I'm going to see that monster.
- You can't.
- Oh, no.
The warning's out.
You've got to stay away from there.
You know it could be terribly dangerous.
Now we've got to get out.
- Come on, Il-woo!
- No, just a minute.
Nobody knows what to do this time.
Neither the generals, nor the so-called politicians.
If I can help,
I've got to see him first.
Well, in my opinion, you're just committing suicide.
Anyway, you were never a hero before, so what makes you think you have to be one this time?
She's right.
Please don't go, Il-woo.
Don't you worry.
I have to go. I'll be all right.
I'll go, too.
- Ico!
- Ico, no, come back! Please!
Ico, where do you think you're going?
I'll bring them back.
You wait here.
Ico. Il-woo.
Repent! All you sinners, repent!
The Lord say's repent!
The Lord say's repent!
Seek ye repentance and ye sall be saved!
Repent, you sinners!
- Pass te beer.
- This is good.
Try some soy sauce.
Down the hatch.
Haven't you heard?
The monster's heading this way.
We'd better all run to te hills now!
And what are we supposed to do if the monster comes to the hills?
Head back to town?
- Go get yourself a cab.
- I don't want to meet that monster.
And I'm sure he won't die of a broken heart if he doesn't get to meet me.
Goodbye, everybody.
- Why, you miserable...
- You know someting, Ito?
What this place needs is a couple of waiters who know how to draw beer.
Ico! Il-woo!
Ico, get back here!
Il-woo, Iook!
He's pretty big, he?
Come back!
You could get killed here! Hurry!
Ico, get up.
- Come on, Soona!
- Come on, come on!
Please, Il-woo.
- Are you all right?
- I think so.
Where's Ico?
- I don't know.
- Where as he gone?
- What do you think?
- We've got to find him.
Gentlemen, the reports all agree on one point, the monster's power.
Not even tanks, it seems, can make a dent in him.
Very well, General.
Now, let me ask you What's next, if I may.
It's hopeless unless we start with the missiles.
Please, General. I've been thinking a lot about those missiles.
You know, they migth do more damage than Yongary.
And I'm very much afraid of one thing.
If those missiles go, they could destroy... one of te truly great landmarks of old Korea.
Gentlemen, as far as I am concerned, the time as come when we must discuss Korea's future and forget about Korea's past.
If he goes north, he'll hit the Pavilion of the Moon.
It seems to me that one ancient landmark is a lot less important than millions of lives.
Come in, Tower, this is Helicopter One.
We are flying above Yongary this minute.
All of his movements are slow at this time.
He as turned completely around and appears to be headed back the way he came.
All right, let's move.
What was it?
Why sould a monster drink oil?
I've got it.
Hum?
What's that?
Gentlemen, we've been observing Yongary.
He just drank a wole storage tank of oil.
He just drank What?
Mother, please.
Uncle Il-woo!
It's him, it's Ico.
- Hey!
- Ico.
- Ico, we thougt you were dead.
- Ico, where have you been, Ico?
Hey, Uncle Il-woo.
- Where were you?
- Watching Yongary.
- Really?
- Yes, and how about this?
- He eats oil and gasoline.
- You mean it?
Yes. I was standing near te main valve.
I shut it off so that he wouldn't be able to get any more to drink.
Boy, was he mad. He started screaming and pawing up te ground.
And guess What?
There was this one tank there.
His tail touced it and it blew up.
That's when he changed.
He started dancing around, itching and scratching.
Why do you think e did that, Uncle Il-woo?
- What kind of tank?
- I don't know.
Wait. There was a terrible smell and lots of ice.
What? A smell? And ice, too?
Uh-uh.
Show me where, Ico.
Il-woo, wait a minute.
You can't go anywere like that.
You're hurt.
I'm not just going to sit around.
- I'd better go with him.
- Soona, please...
Ico, no!
You have to stay here.
- Sorry, Il-woo needs my help.
- Oh, no, Ico. Ico...
Hello. I'm Professor Il-woo Nami.
I've got to get a closer look at Yongary.
Will you please let me in?
You got here a bit too late, sir.
They're going to hit Yongary any minute.
They'll be using guided missiles.
You'd better go.
They're going to it Yongary any minute.
They'll be using guided missiles.
You'd better go.
Missiles? Really?
They'll be no use.
Well, let's hope they are.
Anyway, I have my orders.
Then I guess we'd better go to headquarters.
I'm sorry. Father?
Soona, you know you souldn't...
Il-woo, What's wrong with you?
It's noting to worry about.
I believe you're planning on missiles as a way of attacking te monster.
- We have no choice.
- I wish you wouldn't.
Why?
It was Ico, here.
His reports on the monster gave me te first clue about it.
- Ico?
- Boy, you should have seen it.
Drank three big tanks of oil.
Gentlemen, there's a definite pattern here.
He consumes eat energy material.
He drinks gasoline and fuel oils.
Now, if eat nourises him, exploding missiles will do nothing more than add energy in larger amounts.
Tey will not destroy him.
All this on a child's story.
It is just a little ridiculous, you'll admit.
So, we've had our little joke.
Now we've got to move.
We've drawn plans.
We had better prepare all the missiles and set the launching in a short time.
- I say ten minutes.
- No, please.
Those missiles are really going to be dangerous.
Why not lure the monster away from te center of town?
You've got to get him in another area.
I mean, if you must go ahead and fire those missiles...
Sounds like a good idea.
Can it be done?
There's only one problem, tought.
How to move te monster away?
Use temptation.
Well, open the fuel tanks.
I mean, the ones at the Namsan depot.
You know,
I really can't take all this seriously.
Now, hold on, wait a minute. this as possibilities.
I say we open te depot.
If this scheme can save one human life, it's whort it.
He's right.
- I'll be in touch with you later.
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye.
- Good idea.
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi.
Well, Il-woo, do you need anything?
Well, yes, as a matter of fact.
A helicopter.
I can get you one.
Why do you need it?
Watch this.
When Yongary was at the refinery, he had a bad reaction from a chemical.
A chemical?
Uh-uh.
And if I'm not completely wrong, well, I think we can get him by using it.
Well, what's it made of?
A precipitate of ammonia.
- What?
- Ammonia?
Uh-uh.
All right.
Let's get it all open now.
Open all fuel vents.
I don't believe it's working.
- What's wrong, then? Not enough?
- Who knows?
- Get a helicopter.
- Yes, sir.
Hello, Six. Right.
Get me a helicopter.
Right. Here you are, sir.
Thank you. To Crew Three.
I see te monster won't move.
Climb two hundred feet up.
You're flying too close.
Acknowledge, please.
- I wonder where Ico is.
- I don't know.
Helicopter crew three reporting.
The monster seems to be reacting to some stimulas, which we cannot see.
He is starting to move, and his horn seems to be turning red.
Hey, it's working!
The monster is moving toward the refinery.
He is now at the refinery.
Time for the missiles.
Yes, sir.
Prepare the missiles.
Prepare the missiles.
- He seems to have slowed down.
- Yes.
This could be only temporary.
I think the solution, the ammonia, needs more work.
The missiles worked, I knew they would.
It happened, see? It's wonderful.
The monster is no longer a menace to our people.
- I knew they'd do the trick.
- Yes.
Let me see...
This migth work.
That's it. It's beautiful!
Hu?
I should have had more faith. this is the answer.
I just knew I was on the right track with that ammonia.
All we need now is a furter refinement of this precipitate.
That'll put him out of business and it's about time.
Il-woo, congratulations.
I'm sorry.
Il-woo, you know, I'm so proud of you.
You must be a genius.
What's wrong with you?
Hey. He's dancing!
Go, Yongary, go!
Hey, What's that?
- Come here.
- Hey, leave me alone.
What do you think you're doing?
Leave me alone, will you?
- Get your big mitts off me, will you?
- Come on.
- Get that kid out of here.
- Come on, let me go!
- Stop kicking, you little brat!
- Control Tower. Control Tower.
- It looks like he's still standing.
- What? Yongary's not dead?
Do you hear me?
- He's still alive, sir.
- That is correct. That is correct.
Area Eight, will you confirm please?
Thank you, Area Eight. Over and out.
- The missiles.
- Yes, sir, immediately.
Platoon.
Get moving!
- It's Yongary! He's alive!
- What?
Look, look! Yongary! Yongary!
Come on! Yongary!
Come on, all of you! Hurry!
Stop crawling! Come on! Yea!
Nothing seems to work.
We'd better head back.
- It's working, look!
- It's working!
Il-woo, you were right.
How wonderful.
He was.
- Oh, my!
- You see?
Stop, please.
No, don't do it anymore.
What is it?
Does he have to be killed?
Does he really?
Please, Uncle Il-woo.
I mean, you should have seen him last nigth. He was dancing.
Uncle Il-woo, we just couldn't have let him stay alive like he was, could we?
Ico, I know how you feel and I'm sure we all do.
Anyway, we have no choice about this.
Il-woo, in a way, you know,
I'm sorry, too.
I wonder if he really meant to hurt us.
Well, who's to say?
You know, we'd better be going.
Yes. We're finished here now. this is one time I don't mind going on record.
Hey, look.
Sir, do you have a statement for the press?
After all, it was your office that was responsible for defeating Yongary.
Well, no, I wouldn't say that.
I really think the first credit goes to Dr. Il-woo.
It was his analysis that gave us the key we needed.
There he is.
You'd better talk to him.
Sir, a moment please.
Do you have a statement for the press, sir?
We'd Iike to know how you did it.
How did you find te monster's weakness?
First of all, I'd Iike to thank the Minister very much.
For the rest of it, I'm gratified that science was able to be of help, but truthfully, that's only part.
Te very first clue was found by Ico, here.
I didn't do anything.
Ico, Ico, tell me how old you are?
About eigth.
Well, acting as scientific advisor to a whole nation is quite a job for an eight-year-old. without your work, we migth all ave been destroyed.
How do you feel about that?
Well, then, perhaps a word from your sister. Miss?
I'm no good at words.
Your brother's pretty special, isn't he, Miss?
Only special about getting himself in trouble.
Apart from that I'd say he's just an ordinary brat of a brother.
I think little brothers are supposed to act like brats, but, anyway, my sister's nice.
What would you like to be wen you grow up, Ico?
I want to be a great scientist, a biologist.
What would you like most in the world?
What wishes?
Let's see.
Well, one wish is about my sister and Uncle Il-woo.
I wish that the two of them would hurry up and get married.
Tey're just standing around doing nothing.
You miserable brat.
- Anything else, Ico?
- Yes, someting about Yongary.
I saw him play and dance.
I think all of you should realize it wasn't is fault.
You call im a monster just because of the things he did.
He was just looking for food and we had to kill him because he got in our way.
He migth have destroyed te entire Earth if we hadn't stopped him.
Of course I know.
I know that we had to kill him, honest.
But my other wish would be that he could be here now.
You're a fine young man.
We're all very proud of you.
Hey, let's get started, can we?
Well, now, then, about tat first wish of Ico's...
I must say we've been waiting for this.
Il-woo, What a wonderful idea.
- I think you should.
- Do you?
And What about Soona?
That sounds like a proposal.
You should take it.
Stop that.
I'd hate to disappoint Ico in all his wishes.
All right, I accept, in front of witnesses, too.
Hey, Soona, just think.
In a month or two, you may ave a little brat like me.
A month? Oh, you.
A lot of corrections: Kilo
I am Criswell!
For years I have told the almost unbelievable, related the unreal, and shown it to be more than a fact.
Now I tell a tale of the threshold, people, so astounding that some of you may faint.
This is a story of those in the twilight time, once human, now monsters, in a void between the living and the dead.
Monsters to be pitied, monsters to be despised.
A night with the ghouls, the ghouls reborn, from the innermost depths of the world.
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.
Let's turn back.
No, it's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
You wouldn't understand.
Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
But there's so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Sure there are, and
I've tried them all; plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.
Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
But horror stories, why all the time horror stories?
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
My monsters have done well for me.
You think I'd give that up just so I could write about trees, or dogs, or daisies?
(chuckles) Daisies.
That's it, I'll write about my creatures who are pushing up the daisies.
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
That's life, my kisses are alive.
Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
All of my books and stories are based on fact, or legend.
That's perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're gonna find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.
I can't see a thing.
Let's turn back.
There's an old cemetery on this road.
I've been there before.
I'm getting the jitters.
Let's turn back.
Okay, just as soon as I find a place wide enough to turn around.
Not so fast.
Not so fast!
It is said on clear nights, beneath the cold light of the moon, howls a dog and a wolf, and creeping things crawl out of the slime.
It is then the ghouls feast in all their radiance.
It is on nights like this most people prefer to steer clear of, uh, burial grounds.
It is on nights like this, that the creatures are said to appear, and to walk!
The day is gone, the night is upon us, and the moon, which controls all of the underworld, once again shines in radiant contentment.
Come forth, come forth, oh Princess of Darkness.
Time seems to stand still.
Not so the ghouls, when a night of pleasure is at hand!
If I am not pleased by tonight's entertainment,
I shall banish their souls to everlasting damnation!
And who is to be first?
One who loved flames.
Her lovers were killed by flames.
She died in flames.
(drum banging and crickets chirping)
One who prowls the lonely streets at night in life is bound to prowl them in eternity.
[Criswell] Ahh, the curiosity of youth, on the road to ruin.
May it ever be so adventurous.
I'm so frightened.
Well we certainly can't stay here, come on.
Where?
In there.
It frightens me.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Then, then what's that music?
That's what I wanna find out.
We have to get help.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
Well, something's making that music.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
All right, don't worry,
I'll be right beside you.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Not dead, in a cemetery?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.
They'll have a telephone.
Come on.
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.
Nothing alive looks like that.
Can't we get out of here?
I'm not sure.
What do you mean?
I'm not sure of myself.
It's just a feeling I've had since the crash, like, like I feel a cold chill all over.
Now this.
I would see for approval, the one who in life worshiped gold above all else.
- Look!
- Be careful, they'll see you.
Throw gold at her.
More gold.
More gold!
More gold!
For all eternity, she shall have gold.
And both couldn't help but remember a line from one of Bob's stories, a sudden wind howls.
The night things are all about me, every shadow, a beckoning invitation to disaster.
I know I should think of other things, of pleasant things, but I can't.
How can I think of other things, of pleasant things, when I am in a place surrounded by shadows and objects, which can take any shape, here in the darkness, any shape my mind can conceive?
Bring 'em in!
They are live ones?
[Mummy] Yes, Master.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
[Mummy] Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
You shall both be rewarded.
My dear empress of the night, put these intruders to the test.
But they are not yet one of us.
A situation easily remedied.
'Fe them that they may watch.
Fiend, fiend!
To love the cat, is to be the cat.
(Playful music and whip snapping)
A pussycat is born to be whipped.
It will please me very much to see the slave girl with her tortures!
(whip snapping and woman groaning)
Torture, torture, it pleasures me!
Torture, torture, it pleasures me!
Torture, torture, it pleasures me!
I'm so frightened.
You've got a right to be.
We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
Those creatures!
Don't let them hear you.
What can we do?
I don't know.
I just don't know, but don't give up.
We're not finished yet.
Easy Shirley, easy!
Panic won't do us any good!
Let me think.
We've got to stall for time.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
Whatever you do, don't do that.
Hold!
Let her continue to learn.
The time is not yet right that they should join with us.
And what is this?
A symbol, Master.
What kind of symbol?
She loved the bull ring and the matador.
She danced to their destruction.
Now she dances to her own destruction.
Her dance is of skulls.
She came to us on the day of the dead.
El dia de los muertos, a celebration in her country.
Her dance has pleased me.
With the loss of her lover, this one cast herself into the volcano's fire.
She was?
As I said, a worshiper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
It would seem so, Master.
[Mummy] I don't like snakes.
I remember the one
Cleopatra used.
Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.
You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
[Wolfman] Argh, hurt her?
[Mummy] Hell it killed her!
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt, slimy, slinky things.
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
She pleases me.
Permit her to live in the world of the snakes.
Now, I will talk to the
Wolfman and the Mummy.
As you wish, Master.
[Mummy] He wants us.
Ah, what do you suppose for?
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
Uh-uhn
[Mummy] I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
Come!
[Mummy] We better go before we make him mad.
We are your servants, Master.
Of course you are.
[Mummy] Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
[Criswell] You know better than that.
We don't know of anything, Master.
[Criswell] Then why do you shake so?
It's not often an emperor like you calls on creatures like us.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Ah, then it is some service you desire of us.
You are the keepers of the damned.
You two know them all, and I am tired of this usual type of entertainment.
I want a decided change.
The moon, is soon gone!
There is little time left for the remainder of the evening's pleasures.
Yes, yes, yes I know all that.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgment until after the next full moon.
It would seem so, Master.
Ah, but I declare there is still time for something.
[Mummy] There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master.
Ah, good.
Then I will see them, dismiss the rest.
[Mummy] Yes, sir, Master.
The ropes are coming loose.
[Shirley] Be careful!
I am, it's our only chance.
Nothing is worth your life.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
I'm frightened,
I'm so frightened.
[Bob] Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
Be careful, oh please be careful.
We'll never get out of here alive,
I know it, I just feel it.
You do?
Yes I feel it in my bones.
You're talking nonsense.
Oh, no I'm not.
These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave.
Or would they?
[Shirley] I should hope not, I hate you!
That sudden?
[Shirley] Yes, that sudden.
If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.
It's all your fault.
And I thought you loved me.
Not yet, I perhaps have other plans for such a pretty one.
No matter, I will tell you when and if you may have her.
The Wolfman informs me that the next one is the woman who murdered her husband on their wedding night.
Now she dances with his skeleton.
Have you not enjoyed the evening's festivities?
Ah, that will soon change when you become one of us.
It would seem that the Wolfman would have you for his own.
I have promised both the Wolfman and the Mummy a reward.
It could be that you are that reward.
You need not worry, not just now anyway.
Leave her alone, you fiend!
Fiend is it!
You will not be so fortunate.
Your existence will cease within moments.
No one wishes to see a man dance.
And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
If I could get my hands on you!
Oh, you could do nothing!
I can save you much pain.
Leave her alone, I tell you!
[Criswell] I do not joke in my proposals.
She is to be mine, it is so spoken!
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.
Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient.
I have but to touch you with my finger and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly.
No, no, no!
I repulse you?
Very well, it seems you have chosen your own fate.
Live with it, I should say die with it!
I've got the ropes loose now.
I've got my hands free.
Be careful, don't change your expression too much.
They must not catch on.
What can we do against them?
I don't know, yet.
We'll just have to watch our chance.
When it comes, I'll know what to do.
I hope I'll know what to do.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
All right, put it on heavy.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.
At least he's got brains.
Him!
I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
Maybe so.
[Mummy] I could make her another Cleopatra.
[Wolfman] Argh ha ha!
[Mummy] Without the snake, of course.
- Well?
- Ah, she will be yours.
- When?
- At your discretion, but first, I desire more entertainment.
The moon is almost gone!
Ah, there is yet time.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light.
I know the laws of the night.
I state there is still time for yet another.
I would have time for my own pleasures!
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it.
I am the sole ruler of the dark world.
There is no one to challenge my authority here.
My word is the law, all powerful.
No one is to challenge that authority, no one!
Is that understood?
It is my command.
I understand, Master.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of everlasting despair.
Now are there others?
There are others.
Well then let us proceed.
[Princess] She lived as a zombie in life, so she will remain forever a zombie in death.
Easy, Shirley, easy!
The moon sinks lower into the hills!
We must hurry to the finish.
I will decide the conclusion.
You had the Mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
Then cancel my order.
The moon is almost gone!
There is yet time.
Don't you want your own pleasure?
Oh, if there is only time!
Ah, there is always time!
All in good time, there is always time.
You shall have your pleasures, that I decree!
All others were but infinitesimal bits of fluff, compared to her.
This one would have died for feathers, furs, and fluff, and so she did.
- The time, is short.
- For what?
Your pleasures of course!
- You mean?
- You may take her now.
Is there time?
You better hope there is.
Thank you, Master, thank you!
Now hurry, hurry,
I will watch!
Your desires may be my pleasure also, our fitting climax to an evening's entertainment.
You must hurry now.
Easy, Miss, everything's gonna be all right.
Bob, Bob?
He's right here beside you, he'll be all right too.
Where are they, where did they go?
They tried to kill me.
What's this you say?
Who was going to kill you?
The ghouls, they all turned into skeletons.
Take it easy, Miss.
What she needs is a good rest.
It's true, I tell you, it's true!
They all turned into skeletons.
She, she cut me here.
Probably was bruised in the crash.
You know, you two were very lucky.
I love you Bob, I really do.
Forgive me?
There's nothing to forgive, it was all a dream.
You love me then?
Of course I do.
Quick, quickly.
Easy does it, careful.
That's pretty bad there, sure enough.
As it is with all the night people, they are destroyed by the first rays of the sun, but upon the first appearance of the deep shadows of the night, and when the moon is full, they will return to rejoice in their evil lust, and take back with them any mortal who might happen along.
Yes, they were lucky, those two young people.
May you be so lucky.
But do not trust to luck at the full of the moon.
When the night is dark, make a wide path around the unholy grounds, of the night people.
Who can say that we do not exist, can you?
But now, we return to our graves, and you may join us soon!

SPIRITS 0F THE DEAD
Hughes!
Hughes!
Are the horses ready?
Whenever you wish, Madam.
Get them, now!
Your guests are still in bed,
Milady.
I slept badly last night!
Wake them! I need fresh air!
I want to ride, to forget this dream I had!
Are you sure it was a dream?
Sometimes you need me... to tell you what you did was real.
Get out!
You're always lurking about!
At the age of twenty-two,
Frederique,
Countess of Metzengerstein
inherited the entire family fortune.
Rarely had a noble of this land
come into such a legacy.
She ruled over it capriciously:
Both night and day
according to her whim.
That morning, haunted by her
nightmare of the dawn,
she decided to take her guests
to the castle
where she had spent
her childhood.
Marquis!
Give me something to drink!
Blood!
Swine!
Milady!
What! Can't I enjoy myself?
Surely one can still laugh.
I love this place.
It's beautiful!
You have ten finer castles.
Finer than childhood?
Fool!
Is that boy still annoying you?
Shall I throw him out?
And supposing he flies...
It would be a pity!
Shoot straight and true!
The cord must break!
Shameful debaucheries,
flagrant treacheries,
unheard of cruelties soon taught
her vassals
that nothing
could guarantee them security
against the remorseless fangs
of this petty Caligula.
Come!
Come on!
Give me the necklace, boy!
- Is this our room?
- I have a surprise for you.
What is it?
There she is.
Don't be silly!
I knew him long before you did!
The other way!
All encouraged her in her whims,
not only her depraved friends,
but many others who feared
her displeasure.
The sole exception to this rule,
was the less well to do branch
of their related Berlifitzing
family,
who were traditional enemies
of the Metzengersteins,
and openly critical
of Frederique's behavior.
These two families had been
locked in discord for centuries,
and their deadly enmity
reaching so far back
that none could remember
its origins.
At this time the young
Baron Wilhelm of Berlifitzing
lived alone in his family's
castle.
Although he was her closest
neighbor,
he had never spoken to his
appalling cousin,
Frederique of Metzengerstein.
For her part, Frederique, if
by chance she caught sight
of her cousin from afar,
would mock at him and openly
show her scorn.
But Wilhelm seemed not to
notice her.
His lively intelligence would have
made him a great success in society
but nothing interested this
young misanthropist
who divided his life between
hunting and his stables.
Help me!
Quickly!
If I find the idiot who set this trap, he'll be flogged for two hours and I'll apply the vinegar myself.
Hurry!
And stop staring!
When a vixen gets caught, she plays dead.
0pen the trap, and she runs off, even if she's injured.
Does it hurt?
Chance alone brought Frederique
and Wilhelm together.
The girl would have preferred
to hate this face
that she knew not, but instead
she was unable to forget it.
Something within her had changed.
Haunted by the memory of
a gloomy, mocking glance,
she had but one desire- to see
Wilhelm again.
Hunting the vixen,
Wilhelm Berlifitzing?
Sultan!
Sultan!
He'll be back.
I'm cold!
A Metzengerstein offers his cloak to a lady.
You don't, apparently!
You never speak, Cousin.
My ankle still hurts from the trap.
Prince!
Do you only speak to animals?
Come this evening.
You'll find what you need.
Most of my guests are boars, buzzards and bears.
It should amuse you.
I won't be part of your collection.
I'm not accustomed to being refused.
- Do not keep bad habits.
- Who do you think you are?
A happy man.
Frederique!
Wilhelm!
Rejected and ridiculed when
she'd never been so sincere
Frederique angrily suppressed
the emotions
that had drawn her towards
her cousin.
Hughes!
Her only thoughts were
her vengeance.
Hughes!
Yes, Milady?
How did he come here?
He galloped here through the flames.
- Whose is he?
- Nobody knows.
Not even the Baron Wilhelm's servants.
No one knows this horse.
- No one can approach him!
- I'll try.
Milady...
The Baron Wilhelm is dead!
What?
He tried to save the horse he loved and died.
Everything went up in flames.
Everything.
Hughes!
Hughes!
Hughes!
Yes?
You will repair this... as it was before.
But that's impossible, Madam!
You will, because I wish it!
Find the best tapestry-maker.
Frederique had ordered the stables
to be set on fire
without imagining that
Wilhem would perish in the flames.
His death satisfied neither her
love, nor her bitterness.
She felt a dark foreboding.
Terror took hold of her.
What are you thinking?
Nothing. Go on.
From that time forth, a marked
change took place
in the outward behavior
of the young libertine.
She no longer left her estate,
excluding all companions.
Qr could the wild, unearthly
horse that she rode constantly
have claimed some mysterious
right of friendship...
Frederique remained faithful
to him.
In the glare of noon,
at the dead hour of night,
in sickness or in health,
in calm or in tempest,
Frederique seemed riveted to the
saddle of that colossal horse,
his audacities so well
accorded with her own spirit.
0ld man, will it take long?
I don't know.
Some days, the threads sing.
0n others, they resist and tie themselves in knots.
I asked you how long.
Weeks... months perhaps.
This spell, which she accepted
with all her being,
reached even
into her solitary moments.
She would spent hours before
the tapestry
that was slowly taking shape.
Fascinated, she watched
the agile hands of the old man,
bringing back to life
the great black steed.
His fingers, so deftly knotting
the threads,
seemed to be weaving with
a fatal logic,
her own destiny.
Help me now, my hands.
You always served me well.
Do not betray me.
Have you worked it out?
- Is it blood?
- No, fire!
Frederique had accepted
and now desired her own end.
She rushed toward the flames.
Like Wilhelm, with Wilhelm,
she will die by fire.
- I want to confess!
- After Mass. People are waiting.
- No! Right away!
- Please...
- After Mass.
- Now, I said!
Proceed.
I don't know how.
Tell me what to do. Help me.
I'm not a Catholic.
In that case, my son, we'll talk after Mass.
I want to confess, you must hear me!
Do not shout.
You're in God's house.
I don't care about God!
I need to understand.
I want to talk.
I've killed a man.
Someone from this town?
I don't know...
I don't think so.
- Ah, a stranger?
- Yes.
Well... no. I know him.
I have always known him.
You're drunk!
Listen to me!
It's your duty.
Why did you kill him?
I'll tell you everything, from the beginning.
Franz von Lowenstein.
William Wilson!
It's from Italy.
It must be from your Mother.
Attention!
At ease.
Silence! Stop that!
Wilson did it!
Wilson!
Down.
Up.
Down.
Up.
Down!
Who's that?
He's the new boy.
- What is your name?
- Wilson. William Wilson.
- What's your name again?
- William Wilson.
His name was Wilson?
The same as yours?
Same name, precisely.
- A coincidence.
- Unacceptable.
Power cannot be shared.
Suddenly I had a rival.
A rival, or rather a companion who beat me in everything, but who watched me from a benevolent distance.
He exasperated me but I felt extremely curious about him.
Good God!
Wilson!
You again, as usual!
We were both expelled.
It took me a long time to forget.
0bviously this childhood incident has always haunted you.
- Before you leave...
- Let me finish!
Several years later
I enrolled in medicine, out of curiosity.
I remind you that a doctor is also a sorcerer.
We shall seek life in the depths of matter.
And now I have the pleasure of dissecting before you a human body which has always been the dream of priests, poets or philosophers.
To be precise, I shall open a human heart.
If we were dealing with a live body, we'd process in this fashion.
Going laterally from the sternum, between the 6th and 7th rib, we'd find the apex of the heart.
But in the present case, we shall section all the ribs of the sub-auxiliary region on the left and the right as far as the sternum.
Then we will separate the diaphragm and fold back the rib cage.
This will reveal the contents of the thoracic cavity.
The heart, gentlemen, is a hollow muscle composed essentially of a firm ventricular mass and a softer auricular mass.
This pump which gives forth as much as it receives, has come to be seen as a symbol of courage and generosity.
Does Mr. Wilson have a comment?
No. In that case, we may proceed.
Thank you!
Even in dealing with a corpse, always be sure of the cleanliness of your instruments.
It is said, gentlemen, that the heart is the seat of the emotions, the passions.
Indeed.
But experience shows that it is the seat of our cares, our sorrows.
Its only generosity lies in the suffering it gives.
So, when we have cut the ribs, separated the diaphragm and folded back what is commonly called the rib cage, we can deliver our patient from the source of her woes.
The doctor is a benefactor.
We will thus bring her relief.
Along with the heart...
No!
We'll remove despair and the pain of love.
Gentlemen, we shall restore her her pristine purity, the peace of paradise lost.
Even if it's a living person, make sure your instruments are perfectly clean.
Here, put this on!
Cover yourself.
Did she die?
Forget about the girl!
It's him, don't you see?
I had to leave the University, and I joined the Austrian Army.
To fight.
But no one fights anymore.
The twin garrison is infamous.
Thanks to me.
People have told me all about the trouble. The poor women.
All was well... until that night.
Don't. It's Wilson!
You recognize me?
I'm flattered.
There were many of us the other night.
It was dark, and you were so busy.
Good evening, Mr Wilson.
- Is that Wilson?
- Be careful, Tonina.
This Wilson is surely not the lover you dream of.
He's made his reputation from men... not from us.
He loves parades, the theater, dressing up.
He needs an audience.
But in private, he puts on a poor show.
- Have you met him before?
- No... and I don't want to.
I hate wasting my time.
- Are you referring to me?
- You... you.
You are not the only man alive, Wilson.
Are you taunting me?
Are you threatening me?
I'm challenging you.
Ace.
She loved cards. But I could always keep my hand up.
I decided to teach her a lesson.
Court card!
Two hundred.
Double.
I'll see you.
Ace, Jack.
Wilson has lost.
Are you sure?
Ace, King.
I thought you were bluffing.
Bluff and window-dressing...
That's you, Wilson.
Ezra, come and sit down.
Nothing's going to happen on a night like this.
Drink up, man.
No. That's what he wants.
Can you not see that?
- But the storm...
- Damn the storm.
Come on, Micah.
Come on and have a drink with us.
Look!
Fetch our hats.
Tell the others to wait.
Quick, man!
Come on.
Do you believe me now,
Micah Smith?
Now that you've seen with your own eyes... do you believe me when I tell you... that's the home of Satan himself?
Aye, aye.
Then come.
Somebody get hay!
Make sure it's dry!
And bring some oil!
Come on, let's go!
Kill the warlock!
Open this door!
Open this door!
Curwen!
Well?
- Where is she?
- Who?
You know who. The Fitch girl.
Do you deny she's here?
Certainly not.
She visits us frequently.
Don't you, Miss Fitch?
Don't you?
Yes.
Of your own free will?
Yes.
- There now, Mr. Weeden...
- Just a moment.
What's your name, girl?
- Really, this is outrageous!
- Quiet!
Your name, child.
You see?
He's taken her mind, her soul... the good Lord knows what else... just like the others.
What do we do about it?
Let him go on with his black magic... or send him back to the hell he came from?
- Send him back!
- Then let's be about it!
No, not the woman.
Leave her be.
She's been hexed.
It'll be right with us again... when he's gone, Hester.
You'll see.
- Send him back to Hades!
- Burn him!
Back where he comes from!
Burn him! Burn him!
Have you anything to say, warlock?
Only this...
As surely as the village of Arkham... has risen up against me... so shall I rise from the dead against the village of Arkham.
Each one of you!
Ezra Weeden,
Micah Smith...
Benjamin West...
Priam Willet...
Gideon Leach... all of you and your children and your children's children... shall have just cause to regret the actions of this night.
For from this night onward... you shall bear my curse.
Burn the devil.
Burn him!
"And travelers, now, within that valley...
"through the red-litten windows see...
"vast forms, that move fantastically...
"to a discordant melody."
Whoa, horse.
There you are, ma'am. Careful.
Thank you, Mr. Carmody.
It was a most enjoyable trip.
Aye.
Thank you.
It isn't often I get passengers for Arkham.
Begging you pardon, sir... did you say you were going to be staying here long?
Why do you ask?
Arkham is an evil place.
The village is cursed.
Don't tell us you're superstitious.
Not at all.
And I'm not a coward, either... but you couldn't pay me to spend a night in this place.
Why not? Ghosts? Spirits?
Perhaps.
I'm sorry, sir... but we don't happen to believe in the supernatural.
And I don't think you do, either. Good-bye.
- Good-bye, sir.
- Good-bye.
And good luck.
It looks cursed.
I'll give it that.
Where are the people?
I can't imagine.
Look. The "Burning Man."
Isn't that quaint?
Yes, very quaint.
It is.
Where else would you find a tavern with a name like that?
We were trying to find a certain house here in town... and we thought perhaps you could help us.
- Whose house is it?
- Ours.
I know that sounds silly.
It belonged to the Curwen family.
We inherited it.
- Curwen, you say?
- Yes, that's right.
I don't know of any such house.
All right. Thank you anyway.
Just a minute.
Why do you want to know about the Curwen place?
Because it belongs to us.
Your name is Curwen?
No, our name is Ward.
Then...?
Joseph Curwen was my great-great-grandfather.
Can you tell us where the house is?
I can, but I won't.
That's what I like about you New Englanders... you're so friendly.
Come, Ann.
We'll find it oursel...
Mr. Ward! Don't go there.
It isn't a house. It's a madman's palace as old as sin.
Palace? In America?
Brought over stone by stone.
Brought over from where?
Europe somewhere. No one knows.
No one wants to know.
But if you value your lives, don't go there.
Why not?
What Edgar...
Mr. Weeden means is... that place is a ruin.
It hasn't been occupied in over 100 years.
Is that what you mean?
- What a strange man.
- Yes.
He has had a bit, but what he says is right.
Mr. Ward,
Mrs. Ward, please... do yourself a kindness.
Go back to wherever you came from... and forget you ever heard about Arkham.
And what do you recommend
I do with the deed?
- Just tear it up?
- Yes.
Just tear up the deed to a palace I've inherited... and forget all about it... without so much as laying eyes on the property.
- Is that your advice?
- It's more than advice.
Come on, Ann.
Mr. Ward...
Take the road out of town about a quarter of a mile.
At the post road, turn left past the cemetery.
You shouldn't have too much difficulty finding it.
Here, I'll show you.
There's the Curwen palace over there on the cliff.
We certainly want to thank you for being so nice, Mr...
Willet. I'm a doctor.
My office is down the street, in case you need me.
I don't think we'll be staying very long, doctor.
You've decided that already?
It seems to have been decided for us.
Thank you, anyway.
Come, Ann.
Thank you.
What do you think?
It's him, right enough... the devil himself.
Nonsense.
- And you helped him.
- As I'd help any stranger.
He's no stranger, and you know it.
I don't know anything of the kind, and neither do you.
Are you blind?
Or do you tell me you've never seen that face before?
I'll admit there's a strong resemblance... but that's a matter of heredity, not magic.
Call it what you will.
One thing is certain...
Joseph Curwen has come back to Arkham.
- Why did you say that?
- What?
That we wouldn't be staying long.
Do you want to stay in a town full of fools like that?
I don't think
Dr. Willet was a fool.
All right, so Dr. Willet wasn't a fool...
The poor thing.
Yes.
Let's get this over with.
Charles, it's you!
It's absolutely fantastic!
Dear, is something wrong?
No.
No. Let's see what the rest of this mausoleum looks like.
Kitchen's over there.
Wait.
That doesn't lead anywhere.
This way.
- How would you know that?
- Just a guess.
I'll let some light in here.
Good evening.
- Who are you?
- My name is Simon.
What are you doing here?
I'm the caretaker.
I was preparing your room.
In the dark?
One becomes accustomed to the darkness here.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ward, if I startled you... but I didn't know you'd be here so soon.
Just a minute.
How is it you expected us at all?
Your attorney,
Mr. Hutchinson, contacted me.
Since then, I've been preparing the palace for your arrival.
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go fetch your bags.
No! No, that won't be necessary.
We're not staying.
But where would you spend the night?
After all, Mr. Ward, this is your home.
Get the bags.
Very well.
Dinner will be served at 8:00, if that's convenient.
Thank you.
You don't really want to spend the night here?
No, of course not, but...
But the old fellow was right.
We have to spend the night someplace. Don't we?
Quiet! Quiet I say!
Is it food you want?
What's wrong with him tonight?
Not him, woman, it! Lt!
How many times must I tell you?
It knows.
That's what's wrong.
It knows who's come back to Arkham.
I'm all packed.
You ready?
- I have decided to stay.
- What?
Just long enough to fix the place up.
With a little work, it could bring a good price.
Don't you think?
I should imagine. I don't know.
I estimate two weeks, perhaps three... to get things started, anyway.
Do you mind?
No, not exactly.
I can't say it pleases me.
Then you go home.
I'm sorry.
It's just that I...
I can't leave now until I... find out... some things.
Nightmarish, yes, but not a nightmare.
They're quite real,
I'm sorry to say.
But what are they, doctor?
Human beings.
Very unfortunate human beings.
They were born mutated.
You see, Mrs. Ward, it requires an extraordinary combination of elements... to form a normal person.
In their case, the combination was wrong.
They were gathered by Weeden, of course... for the purpose of frightening you away.
But why, doctor?
Why should we be treated as though we have the plague?
Because you do.
To these people, at any rate.
Understand, Mr. Ward,
Arkham is a strange community.
You see, it's haunted.
Not by ghosts, but haunted nonetheless.
By fear, by guilt... and by the memory of a particular night.
Particular night?
But what has this to do with us?
You see, 150 years ago... a man named Joseph Curwen moved to this village... and built this palace.
His first wife died in childbirth, so he selected... the most beautiful woman in the village... and took her for his mistress.
Unfortunately, she was engaged to marry... an Arkhamite named Ezra Weeden.
No, thank you.
You spoke with his descendent yesterday.
- The man at the inn.
- Yes.
According to legend, a number of strange things... occurred when Curwen moved into the village.
Terrible noises were heard in the night.
Thank you.
Young girls were said to have disappeared from their homes... to be gone until dawn... and then reappear with no memory of their whereabouts.
Weeden wasted no time... in placing the blame directly on this doorstep.
He and his coterie of friends... claimed that Curwen was a warlock.
Warlock?
Yes. One who conjures up the dead.
They demanded punishment.
And one night the people of the village... marched on the palace... dragged your ancestor into the yard, and burned him.
Burned him?
The "Burning Man."
That explains the guilt.
What about the fear?
Curwen put a curse on the village.
He vowed that he'd return.
You can see the resemblance yourself.
I'm sure that every warlock or witch... who died in America left a curse.
Why should Curwen's be taken so seriously?
Why should it be remembered after all these years?
I can't say.
He was a strange man.
There were terrible rumors about him.
Such as?
It was thought that he had gained possession... of a book called the Necronomicon.
Have you heard of it?
No.
It obviously never existed... except in the minds of the superstitious.
But they claimed it held enough secrets... to give a man absolute power.
Of course, every mythology has such a book... but the Necronomicon supposedly contained formulas... through which one could communicate with... or even summon the elder gods... the dark ones from beyond who had once ruled the world... and now are merely waiting... for an opportunity to regain that control.
Cthulhu, Yog-sothoth.
Dreadful rubbish, I know.
Still, the people of Arkham believed it.
They claimed that Joseph Curwen and two other warlocks... were trying to open the gates to these dark gods.
Open the gates? How?
They claimed that
Joseph Curwen was trying... to mate those beings with humans to create a new race... through which the gods could regain their control.
That's how they explained the mutated births... unsuccessful experiments passed on... from generation to generation, carried in the blood.
What's your explanation, doctor?
I don't have one.
I advise you to leave this village.
I advise you to flee it... as you would from a madman with a knife... who feels compelled to destroy you... before you can destroy him.
It's a cold night, sir.
You'll need your coat.
Thank you.
You seem troubled, sir.
Is something wrong?
You didn't hear them?
Beg your pardon?
The voices? People?
No, sir.
Must have been the wind.
Perhaps you should ask
Mr. Curwen.
- Curwen?
- Yes.
Maybe he could tell you.
Welcome, Joseph.
Simon. How long?
110 years.
110 years?
And whose body is this
I'm now occupying?
His name is
Charles Dexter Ward.
My great-great-grandson.
Perfect.
All the others were useless.
You would not accept them.
No matter.
- Where's Jabez?
- Here, Joseph.
Jabez, my old friend.
We three... together again.
But... briefly, I fear.
I shan't be able to hold him much longer.
He fights me.
When will you have full control?
Soon, Simon.
Keep him here for a while longer... and he will be all mine.
He has my blood.
I can feel it.
The book.
The book!
Good.
Good.
Now leave me, my friends.
He fights me.
He fights to leave me.
What is it?
What's the matter?
Dear, what are you doing down here?
I don't know.
I must have walked in my sleep.
Please, dear, let's leave here now, tonight.
I want to, but... I can't.
Why not?
Why not?
Over a whole week he's been there... and what's he been doing?
That's what I want to know.
What's he been doing?
Getting ready, that's what.
And meanwhile, we sit here like sheep.
Willet, I thought you said he'd be gone.
I thought he would be... but you made him feel so welcome... he's probably decided to stay for good.
Go on, sneer.
You can afford to.
You have no halfwitted thing locked in your attic... and no woman to worry about, either.
I've got this whole town to worry about.
The man you fear is dead!
Can't you fools get that through your heads?
He died over 100 years ago.
He can't harm you or your women.
Don't you forget, doctor... that the man who died over 100 years ago... he did this!
And now... he's back with us again.
He'll be doing more.
Unless we stop him.
- Where have you been?
- Out walking.
- At this time of night?
- Yes, at this time of night!
Must I report my movements to you like a schoolboy?
- No, of course not...
- Then mind your own business.
- What's happened to you?
- Nothing whatsoever.
No, you've changed.
I've never seen you like this.
If you won't go back to Boston, at least let me call Dr. Willet.
No.
I shall be calling on Dr. Willet personally within the week.
Now, are you satisfied?
- Yes.
- Then go back to bed!
What will you be doing?
That is not your concern.
Good night.
Good night.
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!
I will never leave you alone.
Your blood is my blood, your mind is my mind... your body, my body.
It will do you no good to resist me.
Your efforts grow weaker every day.
No. No!
You cannot keep me out.
My will is too strong.
Too strong for you.
Too strong for you.
- Why are you spying on me?
- I heard voices.
Tomorrow you must leave.
Is that understood?
- Yes.
- Now go to your bed.
- You lost him?
- For a time.
He has a strong will, stronger than we thought.
But you did well.
He has the Curwen strain.
Hester.
Where are you?
Is that you?
Mrs. Ward.
I heard sounds.
Thought we had prowlers.
- It was his wife.
- Where is she now?
- In her room.
- Did you lock it?
Yes.
Stupid woman. She doesn't know what it is to love.
It has been too long.
No, we will continue trying.
Yes, as you say.
We'll continue trying.
- Help me upstairs quickly.
- Yes.
Quickly.
I've been so afraid.
What is it? What's happened?
Tell me.
I don't know. It's this house.
I think I must be going out of my mind.
Where have I been tonight?
Don't you remember?
No. I'm so confused.
We've got to get out of here before it's too late.
Yes, dear.
Tomorrow morning.
Yes, we will.
- Leaving so soon?
- That's right. Any objections?
Certainly not, sir, but I can make no plans... until I know what you want to do with the palace.
- We're selling it.
- I see.
Sir, could you issue a check for the week's expenses?
- All right. How much?
- I'll get the receipts.
No, that won't be necessary.
How much? We're in a hurry.
It'll only take a moment, sir.
You go out to the coach.
I'll join you in a minute.
Mrs. Ward.
Doctor, you almost missed us.
We were just leaving.
Very wise decision, particularly under the circumstances.
What do you mean?
Did something happen?
I'm afraid so.
In fact, I was on my way to warn you... but it doesn't matter now.
Doctor, please,
I'd like to know.
There was a rather ugly occurrence last night.
- In Arkham?
- In the cemetery.
A grave was dug up and a body stolen.
Nobody knows who did it, but the people... as you might well imagine, are blaming it on your husband.
Why?
The grave that was opened was that of Hester Tillinghast...
Joseph Curwen's mistress.
And they think Charles...
What's wrong with those people?
They're stupid to the marrow of their bones.
You know who robbed that grave, don't you, doctor?
- No.
- They did.
They?
Weeden and his dirty little friends.
- Why would they do that?
- Why? Isn't it obvious?
To frighten me.
To drive me away from my home.
It's a possibility...
But you don't think I did it, do you, doctor?
No, but it's a good thing you're leaving, all the same.
But I'm not leaving.
Charles, you promised.
You can go back to that village, doctor.
You can go back and tell those people... that Charles Dexter Ward has decided to stay.
How long has he been like this?
It started the first night... just for a little while, and then he was himself again.
But it kept happening.
What kept happening?
This... change.
I'm so afraid.
I've never seen him like this.
Mrs. Ward, I want you to tell me exactly what has happened... since your arrival in Arkham.
- I have him now.
- Are you sure?
Charles Dexter Ward is dead.
- Then we can begin our work.
- Not quite yet.
There are a few little things
I must do first.
Can't you forget what happened?
Forget?
Forget that my flesh was burned from my bones... while I was yet alive? No.
No, this village will pay for its crime, just as I vowed.
- But the work.
- The work?
There can be no work without my knowledge.
We've waited 110 years.
We can wait a bit longer.
I'm not an alienist... but there can be little doubt as to what's happening.
Your husband is reacting to the legend of his ancestor.
The attitude of the village, the remarkable resemblance... between him and the figure in the portrait... the atmosphere of the castle are all working together... to cause this aberration.
Then I've got to find a way to help him.
You're not going back in there?
Yes. What else can I do?
Leave him?
I would advise it.
But, then, of course, you can't.
No.
Promise me one thing... that you'll contact me if things get out of hand.
Yes, I will, doctor.
Thank you.
Why have you returned?
Because you need me.
Perhaps you're right.
Come here where I can see you.
Do you love me?
Yes.
Then kiss me.
Why do you hesitate?
Surely a husband has certain rights.
I demand that you kiss me!
What delights we'll share, we two!
What tender, intimate delights!
Maybe it was a leprechaun.
It's nothing to laugh at, Bruno.
I say, who but the devil would do such a thing?
He couldn't have lifted it alone.
Sure not, but remember the two that worked with him.
They was never caught.
Aye, or maybe it was Dr. Willet gave them a hand.
No. Willet's a fool, all right, but he's one of us.
Remember... it was his great-great-grandfather... who helped with the burning.
And yours that held the torch.
And it was yours that did the burning... and don't be forgetting that!
Forget it? I'm proud of it!
In fact, I've been thinking along the same lines myself.
I'll be no part of murdering!
Who said murdering?
Me? Did I say murdering?
What are you talking about?
Self-protection.
That's what I'm talking about!
A man threatens your life and you have... the means to stop him, what do you do?
He's done no threatening.
Not yet, but he will!
First this unholy business at the cemetery.
Next, our women will start wandering out late at night... eyes all glassy, bellies filled with God knows what.
Then you'll see!
I say this to you, all of you.
If we do nothing but sit around and talk about it... then we deserve whatever we get!
Now, good night to you!
Get away!
Get away, you damned thing!
Get away!
The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.
Blessed be the name of the Lord.
In this veil of tears...
We suffer much and sin mightily.
Yet we take solace in the promise... of thy eternal forgiveness.
Amen.
Have you not gorged yourself enough on revenge?
You do not know the extent of my appetite.
I will not have my fill of revenge... until this village is a graveyard... until they have felt, as I did... the kiss of fire on their soft, bare flesh.
All of them.
Have patience, my friends.
Surely after all these years...
I'm entitled to a few... small amusements.
What do you want?
What do I want?
Merely to exercise my husbandly prerogative.
Is there anything so strange about that?
- Please...
- "Please"?
Please what, my dear?
I know.
You're upset because
I've neglected you.
That's it, isn't it?
I've been very busy, but I'm back now.
We have the whole night before us!
Stop it! No!
Stop! No!
You fool!
You stupid, weak little fool!
It is useless.
No... I will try again!
Doctor! Thank God you've come!
- Why? What's happened?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
Something terrible!
- Where is he?
- I...
Look, Mrs. Ward, you must calm yourself.
Then you must tell me everything, sparing no detail.
Your life and your husband's may depend upon it.
Yes, doctor.
We were up in the bedroom a short time ago.
And then, all of a sudden, he...
Doctor, you've got to help me get him out of here!
This place is killing him!
Joseph Curwen... he's killing him!
Look at him.
That filthy, horrible old man! I hate him!
Mrs. Ward!
I'm sorry, doctor.
It was a stupid thing to do.
Yes, it was.
How are you, doctor?
Excellent, thank you.
Glad to hear it.
This is a pleasant surprise.
- What brings you here?
- Nothing in particular.
- Just looking in?
- That's right. Do you mind?
Mind? No. On the contrary.
I'm delighted... and so is my wife.
Aren't you, my dear?
Here. A little glass of wine will make you feel better.
I don't want any.
The doctor and I are going to have a little chat.
So you will just stay here and rest, eh?
There you are. Come, doctor.
- She sent for you, of course.
- No, as I was...
There's no need to lie, doctor.
In a way, I'm glad. I've been terribly upset about her.
This house has a strange effect on her.
How do you mean?
You saw how she acted a moment ago.
That sort of thing.
Fits of depression, anger, hallucinations.
I hoped it would pass, but she gets worse every day.
I see.
I suppose she told you how... l've begun to change?
Yes.
Part of the pattern.
I scarcely recognize her anymore, doctor. My own wife.
What do you want me to do?
Take her back to Boston.
Get her out of this house.
Why don't you?
She wouldn't permit it.
She fears me.
Can't you understand?
Yes, I think I can.
- Then you will help?
- I shall try.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
But remember... discretion.
She mustn't guess that you know the truth.
My dear, I have a surprise for you.
You won't have to stay in this place any longer.
The good doctor is going to take care of you.
Dr. Willet!
Yes, it's all arranged.
He will see you to Boston.
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.
Doctor, you don't understand!
Come along, Mrs. Ward.
No! I won't go!
Please, Mrs. Ward.
All right.
You needn't bother to pack.
I'll send your things along.
Good-bye, doctor.
Good-bye, my dear.
We'll be together again soon.
I promise.
- What of his woman?
- We're rid of her.
- Did you...
- No, it was not necessary.
I convinced the good Dr. Willet... that she had begun to lose her mind... to imagine strange things... even that her own husband had turned against her.
They'll lock her away.
But if Dr. Willet should return?
He will learn that Charles Dexter Ward... has retired to his New England estate.
Do you know of any law prohibiting a man... from residing on his own property?
Now, let us begin again.
You can see what happened to poor Gideon.
What are we going to do about it?
Let's do something!
Let's get him!
What's happened?
Don't you really know what happened, Mrs. Curwen?
My name is Ward.
No, I don't know.
- We came to see Gideon.
- Then come and see.
There's Gideon... and each and every one of us... unless we do something about it.
Just a minute. Do you know how this happened?
It didn't just happen, doctor.
It was caused to happen.
By whom?
Do you know who did it?
- Aye, and so do you.
- Who?
The man who swore to do it.
The man you call
Charles Dexter Ward.
My husband would never do such a thing!
She's lying!
They're all in this!
Mrs. Ward, you better come along with me.
- Where are we going?
- Back to the palace.
We've got to get him away from there before these people... decide to take matters into their own hands.
Whoa!
Doctor, I'm going with you!
Don't be foolish!
Wait here until I come back!
- I'm going with you!
- Then we must hurry!
- Lucien, you got the ropes?
- Here!
- Elijah?
- Aye!
All right, then!
Let's be about it!
Mrs. Ward!
- Did you find him?
- No.
- What about Simon?
- Who?
- The caretaker.
- I didn't see anyone.
I know Charles is here!
Is there any more to the place than we've seen?
I don't know.
Wait a minute.
When you tried to destroy the picture... suddenly he was in the room.
Did you see him come in?
- No.
- Neither did I.
Charles Dexter Ward!
Are you down here?
Don't!
It's only a book.
It's much more than a book.
My God!
- What did you see?
- What a pleasant surprise.
Now that you've seen all of the palace...
Dr. Willet, what do you think of it?
It's quite old, you know... older than you might imagine.
Torquemada spent many a happy hour here a few centuries ago.
- It was old then.
- Mr. Ward...
I'll admit the furnishings do leave something to be desired... but it has a lived-in quality, don't you think?
After all, home is where the heart is.
Isn't that so, my dear?
Listen to me!
I'd be happy to, doctor, but my friends grow impatient.
Please forgive me.
May I present
Miss Hester Tillinghast...
Mr. Simon Orne, and Mr. Jabez
Hutchinson I believe you know.
They are my associates.
You see, we began a project a few years ago... but, unfortunately, it was interrupted... and we're most anxious to take it up again.
What sort of a project?
The most important ever attempted of humans... more important than you can ever imagine... and therefore, I fear, beyond your understanding.
As a matter of fact, we don't fully understand ourselves.
We obey. That is all.
We obey.
Come!
Come, I said!
No! Stop!
What are you doing to her?
Honoring her, Dr. Willet.
Honoring her.
Maybe we'll just smoke him out!
Poor Ann!
You traitor!
Dr. Willet, get her away from here!
Get her away from here,
Dr. Willet!
Take her away!
Get her away from here!
- Quickly! Quickly!
- What about Charles?
I'll come back for him!
They're finished.
Are you all right?
Yes... thanks to you and to my wife.
I don't know how I can ever repay you... for what you've done,
Dr. Willet... but I intend to try.
Are you sure you're all right?
Perfectly sure, my dear.
Perfectly sure.
Hey, hold it. Whoa. Whoa!
Here, look at this.
- Why, it's a skull.
- You mean off some dead fella?
- It looks like stone to me.
- Hey!
Look at those dead eyes.
- Get a load of those gnashers.
- Eh!
Hey! Careful with it. It's a fossil.
It may be worth money, you know that.
I've known things dug out that have fetched a fortune.
Ah, nix. Right!
POLICEMAN: Come along now, please.
Unless you're passengers or press, keep the entrance clear.
Come along now, please.
RONEY: The London Transport people very sensibly ordered all work on the site to cease.
And, at that point, the Nicklin Institute was called in and we started digging.
We made our first dig about there, you see, and that's where Square Five is now.
- We think that's another scapula.
- WOMAN: Huh?
A shoulder blade. How is it, Miss Judd?
It seems to be better than the others.
There appear to be six bodies here at least.
Now, if you'd all just step up this way.
What's that?
Don't worry, gentlemen, the train won't come through here.
No rails.
Now, gentlemen, this little press conference hasn't entirely met with official approval.
Uh, may I say that?
The fact is I need your help.
In the last two days, my assistants here have done wonderful work and we've unearthed a lot of valuable stuff.
- Valuable?
- How valuable, Dr Roney?
To science? I can't tell yet, but I do know this is one of the most remarkable finds ever made.
Now, what I want to say to you is this...
The London Transport people have halted their extension work for the next few days.
But it isn't days we need here, it's weeks.
I know, and you all know, they'll soon be under pressure to start again, to stop wasting public money.
That's where I need your help.
Tell the public why we should be allowed to stay.
Dr Roney, what actually makes this find so remarkable?
These fossils prove, I firmly believe, that creatures essentially resembling mankind walked this earth as long ago as five million years.
Isn't that much further back than has been supposed?
- Yes. A good deal.
- That's tremendous.
Can you actually prove it?
No, not until I've got every scrap of evidence out of here and made full tests.
It's just my personal conviction based on what we've found so far.
And what actually have you found so far?
Parts of two skulls, fragments of upper and lower limbs.
Gosh! And can you actually tell what these, what, ape men looked like?
Hardly, at this stage.
Yes, I think I can.
At least I'm prepared to take a chance.
Uh, Bert. Excuse me.
This is my attempt at a reconstruction.
The modelled parts show what we've found up to now, filled out with imaginary flesh.
He wasn't very big. He had the face of an ape.
He had a big brain and he stood like a man.
- Miss Judd.
- Miss Dobson, what is it?
I've struck what seems to be a buried pipe.
RONEY: What we must have now is time.
We've got to get public support or there'll be tube trains running over this site, bones and all, before we can get everything out.
Whatever it is, it's big.
- A main water pipe perhaps.
- LT INSPECTOR: Not here.
A sewer then?
That would be awkward, wouldn’t it?
Good thing I wasn't using a pickaxe.
There shouldn't be anything.
BARBARA: Dr Roney.
- Anything wrong?
- You'd better have a look.
There is just one possibility.
- Good morning. This way please, Captain.
- Good morning.
- This is Dr Roney.
- Where's the bomb?
Here.
That's right, tear it all up!
What would you say it was, sir?
Uh, looks like a big one.
Maybe a Satan.
Yes, sir, except I've never seen a Satan with bumps.
POTTER: Mmm.
POTTER: Strange.
Won't hold.
No ticking.
Odd though.
The mike doesn't stick, so it can't be steel, and there's no corrosion of the surface.
Feel it.
We'll dig down a bit.
Let the dog see the rabbit, mmm?
Corporal Gibson, two men with shovels.
Right, Sergeant. All right. Webster, Jenkins.
Right, Sergeant, five minutes.
Five minutes.
You know, I don't think this is any kind of metal.
Then what, sir?
Captain Potter, can you tell me yet how long this is going to take?
I realise it must be difficult.
Look, sir, I advised you to leave.
Yes, I know.
But you'll appreciate I have a special interest.
- How long would you say?
- I don't know, yet.
You're a young man. You can't possibly have had the wartime experience that would...
I should call in a second opinion. Is that it?
- Well, yes.
- Well, don't worry. I intend to.
GM2.
Just a moment, sir.
It's for Colonel Breen.
Oh, I'll take It. Scrambler?
No, it's blue. It's clear.
Hello? I'm afraid
Colonel Breen is not available.
What's it about?
A bomb?
But surely you realise he's no longer connected with...
How big?
Good God.
Give me the details.
I'll get the message to him as soon as he's free.
What is there to argue about?
The purpose is quite clear.
Colonel Breen, my Rocket Group has been intended all along for peaceful scientific research.
Professor Quatermass, your Rocket Group?
Yes, mine.
I brought the whole thing into being.
But it is, after all, a government project.
And now the government has had a change of policy.
Change of policy!
You're going to take it over and pervert it to this... This...
Listen. Within 10 years, there will be permanent bases on the moon, perhaps even on Mars.
- Military bases.
- BREEN: Of course.
The present world situation makes that quite clear.
Whoever plants them first will be able to police the Earth with ballistic missiles.
So, we must be in the race.
Well, of course.
The ultimate weapon. It always is.
Gentlemen, don't you see?
We're on the edge of a new dimension of discovery.
It's a great chance to leave our vices behind, war first of all.
Not to go out there dragging our hatreds and our frontiers along with us.
Frankly, I'm surprised and disturbed to hear such naive views still being put forward...
- Naive? You've lost touch with humanity.
- There is nothing to be gained...
You've been shut away too long in this ivory fortress of yours.
That's your trouble.
HOWELL: Well, he'll be out of it soon.
Colonel Breen is joining you at the Rocket Group.
- What?
- HOWELL: At the end of the week.
I think you'll agree that someone with experience of military rockets, missiles, will be of considerable value.
I'll fight this right at top-level!
HOWELL: I shouldn't. It came from there.
It'll work out. For the good of the Group.
And now, gentlemen, if you'll both excuse me,
I have another meeting.
Nose to the grindstone.
I won't resign, if that's what you want.
Of course not.
I'm sure we'll get along quite well.
Why not have dinner with me? My club?
Come.
Oh, I can't possibly... Who's this from?
Oh, I see.
Do you ever find your early career catching up with you?
I never had a career. Only work.
What was yours?
Enemy missiles.
Do you mind stopping off on the way for a couple of minutes?
Lead on, please.
Captain Potter, sir.
- I hope you didn't mind my...
- Any sign of the mechanism yet?
None, sir. We've found this cavity, but there's only impacted clay inside.
- Stand down for a moment, Briggs.
- Yes, sir.
Any guesses?
- Possibly a German V weapon.
- Why?
A flying bomb? A V-2 Rocket?
- It's not either of them.
- Obviously.
But they weren't the only surprises they cooked up in the war.
There were more than anyone knew.
- Sir!
- What is it?
I don't know. It may just be a stone.
CLEGHORN: It's another one of them skulls.
- Corporal.
- CORPORAL: Sir.
- Is Dr Roney still here?
- Yes, sir, I'll fetch him.
- POTTER: It's a skull.
- Let me see.
- Thanks.
- Who is this man?
- Potter, is he attached to you?
- No, sir, that is...
Let me go! Thank you.
Don't you know?
Dr Roney's the man of the moment.
This place is news.
He has no business here now.
Hasn't he?
Thank you. It's absolutely marvellous.
Oh, it's magnificent!
Better than anything we've got so far.
It's almost intact.
- Intact?
- Yes, yes.
This proves everything. It's all I needed.
- No, no, leave it to me.
- You might drop it. It's slippery.
- Drop it? Not on your nelly!
- Here.
How do you think it got inside there?
Oh, it was here in the clay, when the missile struck, it got rammed through.
(SCOFFING) Unbroken? A fragile fossil?
Dr Roney, my name's Quatermass.
Are you one of these bomb experts?
- Not exactly.
- Miss Judd here will look after you.
- QUATERMASS: How do you do?
- Hello.
RONEY: I've got to get this skull under treatment.
That skull seems remarkably well-preserved.
Yes, isn't it? Far better than the first.
What do you think protected it?
Huh? Oh, it was inside the... Inside that...
Good Lord!
I was so concerned just now, I didn't realise.
It was inside. That's no bomb.
Whatever is it?
How old is this fossil skull?
About five million years. It could be more.
Excuse me.
And these are all the Civil Defence records of the area?
- That's right, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Breen, I'd like a word with you.
- Just a moment.
Now, you're quite certain?
There were no HE bombs on the street above here, sir.
Just a few incendiaries, and they only did damage because the houses were empty.
Empty?
Evacuated. Thank you, Sergeant.
Come on, Potter.
Let's have another look at this thing.
Excuse me, sir, but that's not quite right.
Oh? Why?
Those houses were all abandoned years before the war.
- What on earth for?
- Well, people just wouldn't live there.
Some kind of scare.
- Scare?
- Superstition.
A lot of nonsense, I dare say.
There, that's done.
Now, I do think you ought to get a breather.
The air's terrible down here.
All right, but just for a minute.
ELLIS: These are the houses, sir.
Or what's left of them.
- They really are derelict.
- Mmm.
Give me that torch, will you? Thank you.
I must warn you, these buildings aren't safe.
Nevertheless...
I've been reckoning it up.
They must have been empty 40 years now.
- Are you a local man?
- Yes, sir.
- Do you remember what happened?
- Yes, I do.
Oh, it was in all the papers.
Of course, I was only a nipper at the time, but I knew a kid that lived in one of these houses.
Things got so bad they had to clear out.
What got bad?
Noises, bumps, and even things being seen.
You mean ghosts?
(STAMMERING) I said it was a lot of nonsense, sir.
But, you know how these tales run wild once they get started.
Those marks. What could have made them?
Kids, sir.
Kids playing around made 'em.
Sorry about that, sir.
Must've been a bit warm inside there.
Yes. Thank you.
BREEN: Everything in order?
POTTER: Yes, sir.
Ah, Quatermass, I've decided to stay on this case for a day or so,
- if you're agreeable.
- Of course.
You go back to the Rocket Group.
I'll join you there later.
As a matter of a fact, I'd like to hang on, too.
- If you're agreeable.
- As you wish.
I've arranged for an extra squad to work all night.
The entire missile should be exposed by the morning.
- Can I?
- Oh, no, thanks. I'll find my own way.
Sorry about the dinner. Some other time.
Miss Judd!
We'd better get down and give your boss a hand.
He'll be expected to get his gear away.
BARBARA: Hob's Lane.
QUATERMASS: They've changed the spelling.
New one's like Hobbs the cricketer.
But the old one...
Hob was once a sort of nickname for the Devil.
Oh, Quatermass, come in. Come in.
- Well...
- QUATERMASS: Hmm.
Our daily work. Business as usual, no matter what happens at Hobbs End.
- Electronics?
- We don't just dig with trowels, you know.
Not all the time. Would you like some coffee?
- Thanks.
- Have you had a cup, Mr Johnson?
- Yes, I have, thanks.
- Don't nod.
Mr Johnson's kindly obliging us for some tests.
You see, some of his skull dimensions happen to match those of our friend here who died in the second ice age.
- I'm real primitive.
- (LAUGHING) We all are, Mr Johnson.
- Now, are you ready for another run?
- Yes, sir.
Right. Recorder on.
Oh, Mr Johnson, proceed with this puzzle, will you?
That hook up, something special?
RONEY: It can locate the minutest areas of the brain.
We take readings and analyse them in the computer here.
We're gradually building up a picture of what that ice age man might have been able to think and do.
The Roney Analysis. I like it.
I'm hoping to apply it next to the Hobbs End skulls.
Of course, they're so much older.
They'll have even fewer points of resemblance to...
Well, to Mr Johnson, but we hope enough to...
Roney, were they of this Earth?
Ah, I see. That's what brought you here.
Were they?
I'm sorry to disappoint but the answer's only, "Yes, they were".
They were earthly creatures as much as you or I.
They were our remote ancestors but they themselves had ancestors going back as far as 30 million years.
Well, how can you be sure?
They fit into the known pattern of evolution.
The only odd thing about them is the great size of the skull.
I've got it all charted somewhere.
Where the devil does she keep everything?
QUATERMASS: Your Miss Judd?
Yes. I told her to take the day off and get some rest.
Well, I must be getting along.
- To Hobbs End?
- Yes.
Look, I can't seem to lay my hands on it at the moment.
I'll show you next time, for what it's worth.
Next time, I'll have a lot more questions.
Yes. They're piling up, aren't they?
- Are you coming?
- RONEY: I've been told to keep out of it.
Your colleague doesn't like my face.
- Colleague?
- Your Colonel Breen.
- Oh.
- Anyway, it's mutual.
I'm sorry, Quatermass, he's a type I loathe on sight.
Full marks, Dr Roney. Well, it's a long story.
I'll tell you sometime.
Ah, Professor Quatermass.
I've something to show you.
I thought you were taking the day off.
No, I was having these made.
I'm sorry, I'm due at the excavation.
Please read these first.
- Photocopies.
- From old newspaper files.
"May 19th, 1927.
"Hob's Lane spook.
Figure that walked through a bedroom wall. "
Why did you do this?
Well, you seemed curious, too, last night.
I've slept on it since.
Look, read this one.
"The figure was small, " said Mr Parker.
“Like a hideous dwarf. "
No, my dear, we're both scientists.
We simply can't pay regard to stuff like this.
- The supernatural!
- Professor Quatermass!
"August, 1927.
"Curious crowds at Hob's Lane became so large
"that work was held up on the new underground railway station. "
Station. That's when they built it?
They were digging near the same spot.
- BREEN: Ah, good morning.
- Good morning.
You've been busy.
You've cleaned out the inside.
- Yes.
- Find anything?
- Only impacted clay.
- Nothing else?
No, it's been cleared inch by inch and finally hosed out with water.
- So far, it seems to be just an empty shell.
- Hmm, let me see.
- Now, just a minute.
- What's going on?
A test.
All right, Potter, that's got to be enough.
- No effect, sir.
- There's got to be.
I don't understand that at all.
The heat's been on that for a full five minutes and it's not even warm.
POTTER: Do you want to try again, sir?
No. There's no chance of cutting a hole through that.
We've found what seems to be a sealed compartment.
What?
You'd better put some gloves on, sir.
Why?
The sergeant's got a touch of it, too.
Like frostbite, mild though.
Thank you, Sergeant.
- From touching this?
- I don't see how, sir.
It's not cold, but...
What's this?
Oh, it's only our pump.
We had a bit of a flood when we washed it down.
Careful! It's like glass in here.
I see. Blocked right across.
Yes, sir.
So, unless it's solid, there's something on the other side of that.
It could be a warhead.
(SCOFFING) Says Colonel Breen.
- Hello, what made these marks?
- Marks?
Not us. This stuff's harder than diamond.
We've tested.
Well, there seem to be...
Have you got a cloth?
Something to wipe it down with.
- Good grief!
- They form a pattern.
More exactly, they form a pentacle.
One of the cabalistic signs used in ancient magic.
I suppose I'd better mention this to the colonel?
No. It wouldn't fit in with warheads.
Sergeant, get this pump out of the way, will you?
Sir. Right. Two men to shift the pump.
West, inside and clear the hose.
Look sharp, West.
Resistant to heat of 3,000 degrees.
Harder than diamond.
Why, it's the material every rocket engineer's been looking for.
What are you trying to say?
That the Germans didn't make this and then lose the secret.
You ask Von Braun.
If I can get through that bulkhead,
I won't need...
Try Borazon.
It's a lot harder than diamond.
Can you get hold of a Borazon drill?
It would mean getting hold of a civilian operator.
POTTER: West!
(STAMMERING) It was... It was a figure.
It went through.
It went straight through the wall!
I saw it! I saw it.
Horrible. Horrible.
BREEN: Is he ill?
QUATERMASS: He may be.
CLEGHORN: All right, West. Take it easy, lad.
I thought it was the wall shining and then it came straight at me.
- Horrible!
- Come on.
Westie's got the horrors.
- What did he see, sir?
- Nothing. The confined space affected him.
A man like that should never have been on this job.
- Now pull yourself together, West.
- Sergeant, that's not the way.
- What did you see?
- I don't know.
You... You said a figure.
Yes, sort of crooked.
It went straight through.
Here.
It was horrible. Horrible!
With its head tucked underneath its arm?
Oh, shut up!
I did see something, sir.
I did, honest. It was little.
"The figure was small, like a hideous dwarf. "
Yeah, that's it.
Here, what made you say that, miss?
How did you know?
It's all right. Here.
Get him away from here. He'd better go sick.
Yes, I'll write a note to the MO.
Captain Potter, he'd better not talk to the other men.
POTTER: Come on.
Do you mind?
Normally, I don't before noon, but...
Thanks.
BREEN: Is that pump clear yet?
GIBSON: Yes, sir.
- Get rid of the oxyacetylene cutter.
- Sir.
Don't make any attempt to drill that bulkhead until I get back.
- Where are you going?
- To find something out.
May I? I think we should follow this up.
"Alarming noises and spectral appearances.
September, 1 763. "
Listen. "Our informant further states
"that grievous sounds emanating from the very earth
"have so affrighted certain fellows employed in the digging of a well
"that one is like to die mad. "
Digging a well?
Do any of the others mention that?
Not so far.
Stories, wild rumours.
They believed in those days.
I suppose it's possible for...
For ghosts, let's use the word, to be phenomena that were badly observed and wrongly explained.
Listen.
"One inhabitant of Hob's Lane doth assert
"he hath oft espied the apparition of a hideous goblin.
"And once, several. "
"Several"?
"And that this place is long notorious for weird happenings. "
Where next?
(SIGHING) The archives of Westminster Abbey, I think.
Uh, "In the winter of the year 1341,
"the religious of that region
"did strive against
"an outbreak of evil at Hob's Lane. "
Oh, please go on. My Latin's not up to it.
Yeah. (CLEARING THROAT)
"Imps and demons did appear.
"Foul noises
"sent by the Devil
"did sorely afflict
"the charcoal burners that had lately come there. "
- Charcoal burners?
- Yes.
Yes, yes, that's right.
They'd be felling trees.
Big, heavy ones.
In 1763, a well was being dug.
In 1927, the underground station.
And now the extension.
All disturbances of the ground.
"This has well been known as a troubled place.
"It is said that, in the time of the Romans... "
I'd better go.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, I have to leave now, but Miss Judd will stay on.
Find out everything you can.
Then collect Dr Roney.
I think he should be in on this.
Uh, many thanks.
Hang it on the grille there, Sergeant.
Ah, Professor,
I've orders to let no one down there.
- What's he doing?
- He's got that drill set up, sir.
The one you suggested.
I asked him to wait.
Powered from this, I suppose.
Yes, sir. Better than the public supply, just in case.
In case it blows up?
That's why he won't let anyone down there, sir.
Oh, very considerate of him.
Oh, I reckon this little beauty would cut through anything.
I did steel armour plate with it.
Six inches thick.
(WHISTLING) Just like that.
Oh, it was legal.
The bloke got shut in a strong room.
But I got him out.
It was a secret job, like this one.
Then I'm glad you don't talk about it.
Ah, Quatermass.
Breen, I think we should hold everything for a time at least.
I can explain.
We're going ahead now.
Hello, Potter?
Right, sir.
All clear!
-Right.
You can get clear if you want to.
There's still time.
Welcome aboard, mate.
Have they started?
That's it.
Do you know what's inside there?
Are you insured? I'm insured.
It's a good thing to be insured.
At least, it cheers you up.
Okay, sir?
Right, here we go.
Try again.
Try once more.
Get back!
The generator, knock it off!
It wouldn't... It wouldn't...
QUATERMASS: The best thing.
You're shaken up. We all are.
It was the vibration in there.
Some sort of freak vibration. Must have been.
- All right, Sladden?
- Hmm.
The drill, it wouldn't work.
Roney, this sound, everything here, just like the old accounts.
- Did she tell you?
- Yes.
- And there's a pentacle drawn inside there.
- What?
See for yourself.
BREEN: As soon as you can.
Thank you, Sergeant.
I'm all right now, sir, if you want to have another bash.
- Good man.
- Breen, wait.
We ought to have time to consider this.
I have.
We'll blanket down the sound with sandbags.
I've ordered them down.
I will cover up the polished surface.
But it isn't as simple as that.
RONEY: Quatermass.
I thought you said the drill had no effect?
Well, I never made that.
What? But you must have.
SLADDEN: I can't have done.
That's much bigger than my drill bit.
It doesn't look as if it was drilled at all.
Looks more like melted.
All right, Sladden, get out of here.
Look out!
The demons.
QUATERMASS: Wait!
It's all right. They're dead.
They've been dead for a long time.
RONEY: What are they?
Whatever they are, they're decomposing fast.
This is a job for you, I think.
Yes. Barbara!
Phone the Institute.
Tell Klein... No, there isn't time.
Just tell him to keep everybody standing by for the biggest job they've ever had.
Phew! The stench! It is like rotting fish!
Or locusts.
I don't think I dare wait.
They're corrupting so fast. Potter!
Catching up on lost time.
What do you mean by that?
They were sealed in there till our atmosphere got in a few moments ago.
Filthy London air.
They might have stayed unchanged for a year, or a million years.
And as quickly as you possibly can.
Yes, Doctor.
- CLEGHORN: What is it, sir?
- Explanations later, Sergeant.
They want planks and empty sandbags.
- As many as you can find.
- Right, sir.
Give me a hand.
- I can't guarantee my stomach.
- Steady.
Easy now. Got him.
Oh, my God.
Throw down something to put this on.
And a sandbag.
Easy.
Take it up to the platform, will you?
I'll fix it there.
Don't just stand there. Give a hand!
Hold it level. It's leaking.
God.
- What is it?
- They don't know.
Where can it go?
Oh, there.
I'd better take a photograph of it.
- What are you using?
- Number Four sealer.
- Is it safe?
- I'll have to risk that.
If I can just save the shells and some body fluids for analysis.
These shapes suggest some kind of apparatus, instruments.
- Your imagination is running wild.
- Isn't yours?
What?
They don't seem to lead through anywhere.
If there were once any external propulsion units,
I don't see how they were controlled.
Unless...
Unless the missile itself did some of the thinking.
You're mad!
This substance isn't inert. Far from it.
We know that.
Don't tell me what I know!
There's been enough nonsense talked about this... this thing.
Dead for millions of years!
I know the smell of death, believe me, and how short a time it lasts.
- Have you got an explanation for all this?
- Yes, I have.
Then why not share it?
When I choose.
Gauze, quick!
I want you to get some photographs of the compartment they were in.
- Of course.
- It's all dropping to powder.
Soon, there'll be nothing to prove we ever saw it.
Do you classify them as insects?
Arthropods.
Nice, general term, covers all the crabs and spiders, too.
Except that no Earthly ones ever had that tripod leg arrangement.
The horned demons in those old prints.
- Roney, this image...
- Rather pretty.
It's like a gargoyle. I mean, in fact.
Haven't you seen it carved in walls in a dozen countries?
Hidden in the depths of all our minds, a race memory.
RONEY: Got it!
Look at this.
A cave painting of 30,000 years ago.
A man in a ritual mask.
I wonder where he dreamed up the idea of that.
Thanks.
Hmm.
You know, I think these are old friends we haven't seen for a time.
Weight and structure point to low gravity environment.
A thin atmosphere.
Perhaps a world that's dead now, but a few million years ago could have been teeming with life.
I wonder.
A name that's been nearly worn out before anything turned up to claim it.
Was this really a Martian?
ATTENDANT: I'm sorry. The Institute's closed.
It's the same round the main door.
They got us in a state of siege.
Miss Judd, can you do something about this?
Get Dr Roney to call 'em off, or we'll be needing the police.
I'll see what I can do.
And there were how many of these ape creatures?
Seven. Well, six at least we found.
Apes with oversized craniums.
Some faculties had developed in them, or had been developed.
What?
The will to survive. It's an odd phenomenon.
Roney, if we found that our Earth was doomed, say by climatic changes, what would we do about it?
Nothing. Just go on squabbling, as usual.
Yes, but if we weren't men?
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Is it possible to give out a statement of some kind?
The crowd outside's getting huge and a bit ugly.
Are those the photographs you took?
Yes.
Right. Let's show them.
Good idea.
NEWSREADER ON RADIO: "The discovery might have some astounding implications, " added Professor Quatermass.
But, for the moment, he could not say what these were.
You can't go down there, sir, but you can read all about it.
Professor Quatermass, sir.
The Minister's waiting.
He's not pleased.
HOWELL: Hello, Minister's Office.
Good afternoon, sir.
Professor, what you've done appals me.
It's the PM's private secretary.
Sorry, still not available.
Try again in 20 minutes.
Now, it's the PM and the Home Office badgering about cordons and special police action.
- (PHONE RINGING)
- Kill that thing!
HOWELL: Sorry, the Minister is not available.
Now, before they pull a special cabinet meeting on me,
I should like to have just a few answers ready.
How much do you know?
Something from Colonel Breen and what I've read in these.
- Why did you do it?
- People wanted to know.
So you talked.
Without authority or consultation.
Whose authority?
This department's.
It didn't seem to me to concern the Ministry of Defence.
We'll see about that.
Now,
"Astounding implications. "
- (PHONE RINGING)
- Cut that off!
HOWELL: No more calls till further notice.
What did you mean by that?
Dr Roney and I are satisfied that these arthropods are not of this Earth.
So I gathered.
You've been busy hinting at Mars.
Mars is dead.
Nothing there but a few scraps of lichen.
Five million years ago it may have been very different.
Suppose, at that time, there were living beings on it with techniques that enabled them to visit the Earth.
At a time when the most highly-evolved creatures here, our own ancestors, were only a type of Pliocene ape.
Go on.
They may have wanted to found another colony when their own world was doomed, but couldn't endure our atmosphere.
- So they experimented.
- Experimented?
The man apes found beside the missile were abnormal.
Oh, and the insects were responsible.
QUATERMASS:
There's clearly some connection.
My guess is that those were ape mutations being brought back for release on Earth.
BREEN: And you really believe that this was possible?
That apes were systematically taken from this planet to another and...
Altered by selective breeding, atomic surgery, methods we can't guess.
And returned with new faculties instilled in them.
High intelligence.
Perhaps something else.
In effect, a colonisation.
It'd be a way of possessing the Earth.
Only a colony by proxy, but better than leaving nothing at all behind.
Surely, it would have had to be carried out on a huge scale?
Yes, if I'm right...
If I'm right, we've just come on a single instance.
Probably an accident, a landing that went wrong and they all died.
The Thames Valley was swamp then.
You realise what you're implying?
That we owe our human condition here to the intervention of insects!
I suppose I am.
So that's your great theory?
And for that we've had all this splutter and alarm and...
Well, at least we can let the Home Secretary off his beat now.
- Get him?
- Yes.
I wanted to hear you first.
Ministry of Defence here. Howell speaking.
- Give me the Home Secretary.
- Breen, tell him.
Tell him!
I told you I had an explanation.
The Germans in 1944.
Breen, you can't be still hanging on to that.
Professor Quatermass.
You are an expert in certain fields, I in others.
One of my specialisations is weapons, and another, military propaganda.
So, kindly allow me my opinion without interrupting.
I think that when the Germans were losing the war, they tried a propaganda scare.
They sent over an experimental V weapon in order to produce exactly the effect it has produced, thanks to your help.
Though, a little late for their purpose.
- And what about the arthropods?
- Fakes.
Put there as a circumstantial touch.
Like fairground mermaids, made up of old scraps of skin and bone.
It's the oldest trick in the business.
- MINISTER: Hello, John.
- No, sir, wait.
You must hear expert testimony.
I have. Is that missile safe?
Thoroughly checked.
- MINISTER: No danger to the public?
- None, I'm certain.
Hello, John?
I'm sorry you've been led such a dance.
It's all over now.
Well, it was nothing but a gigantic false alarm.
LOUDSPEAKER: Move along. Move along.
This is an official statement.
In spite of incorrect news stories published earlier, the missile found here is believed to be a German propaganda weapon of the last war.
It has now been dealt with and is not dangerous.
Repeat, there is no danger.
A full statement will be issued shortly.
Now move along please.
REPORTER: Inspector, can we go down there and take a look?
Tomorrow. It'll be wide open to all you boys then.
Press, TV, the lot.
These bloody sacks.
Couldn't we have forgotten them, Sarge?
No, Army property, very precious.
Well, you might have let me know you were packing up.
I told you, I was only round the caff.
Very sorry, sir.
I didn't want to interrupt your tea break.
Oh, that's all right, my man.
I'll overlook it this time.
Well, I'd better get my stuff out then.
Hey, come off it. My tool box.
- Bloody Army!
- Right, let's go home.
Uh-oh, where was Moses when the lights went out?
In the flippin' dark.
Excuse me.
Uh, sorry, miss.
The station's closed till tomorrow.
But I must go in. I left a microscope and a box of slides down there.
There's only the emergency lights left on now.
I won't be a moment.
Please, I must have them.
All right, miss. I'll wait for you.
Thank you.
Hey, what's going on here?
Hey! What's going on?
Professor Quatermass? He's in here.
SLADDEN: Hello, miss.
Hello.
- Have you called a doctor?
- No.
When I heard those sounds,
I asked Mr Edwards, the choirmaster, to go and to dismiss the choir.
I knew I must stay alone with this man.
I felt sure he had been in contact with spiritual evil.
I'll have to question him.
Perhaps tomorrow.
No, there may be danger, in waiting, to others.
Sladden?
Can you say what happened tonight in the excavation?
You remember being there?
Well, you stayed to dismantle some equipment.
You were hurt by something flying through the air.
Do you remember objects doing that?
Moving by themselves?
I had to run, to get away. They were coming.
Who? What were?
Them. Them!
No more, please!
I remember it started and then I could only see them like you found down there.
With the eyes and horns and...
He saw the creatures.
SLADDEN: (WAILING) And they were alive!
Alive?
Hopping, like very fast, and hundreds and hundreds!
And I knew I was one.
How did they move?
Jumping, leaping.
- Let him alone!
- Where?
In and out. Them big places.
In and out of them.
Oh, huge! Right up in the sky!
The sky? What colour is it? Blue?
No.
Dark.
Purple.
VICAR: You should have left him alone.
He isn't free of it yet.
- Perhaps it was always in him.
- What do you mean?
In all of us.
An inheritance of dormant faculties.
Clairvoyance, telekinesis.
Scientific terms to explain it all away.
On the contrary, I agree with you.
What's been uncovered is evil.
As anciently diabolic as anything on record.
I think what he gave us just now was a vision of life on Mars five million years ago.
That and the unconscious ability to cause movement.
They're old powers that can be awakened somehow by the thing in the pit.
Shouldn't we tell the Ministry? Warn them?
They wouldn't listen.
We're going to need proof.
- Have you the keys to the Institute?
- Yes.
Good. We'll work from there.
QUATERMASS: Is that the Rocket Group?
Right. It's Quatermass here.
No, no, no.
This is Professor Quatermass speaking.
Now put me on to Mr Watson.
I know he's in bed. Just stir him up.
What's all this about?
Oh, thanks for coming.
I'm afraid I've been grubbing about in your workshop already.
There's something we can do.
Oh, Jerry? Well, wake up.
Now, listen, I want you to bring some gear to London right away.
The special video signal stuff.
As follows. Yes. Now, better take notes.
- (MACHINE HUMMING)
- QUATERMASS: Well, Jerry?
Not a sausage.
No wonder, after bumping the stuff over half the roads in the country.
It's delicate.
Miss, are you sure we're still locked on to those settings?
BARBARA: Quite sure. The signals are still coming through here all right.
I'll check the positive feedback.
Maybe it's Roney.
What do you want me to do?
Ah, just go to sleep. You've been saying for hours how tired you are.
You should have got our friend Johnson.
You can practically read his mind without gadgets.
Are you still hopeful?
He thinks it might work.
Your apparatus to locate the brain centres, ours to translate signals.
If it does, you're...
You're going to try and repeat what Sladden went through?
Experimentally.
You said these faculties may be in all of us.
Poltergeist outbreaks. Second sight.
They've been recorded the world over, throughout the ages.
Myths, magic, even witchcraft.
Perhaps they all came from there.
So as far as anybody is, we're the Martians now?
The unconscious vision centres.
Better shut the grille.
Keep any nosy parkers out.
When the light flickers, switch off.
Right.
It seems to draw energy from any source.
But more so from that generator.
Perhaps by induction.
RONEY: Hold still a minute.
Right.
Now you'll do exactly what Sladden did.
- Once the generator goes off, I use this.
- Yes.
Now, back here for you, my dear.
But if there's anything to photograph...
It'll keep. Right.
Now then, let's get a true reading.
All signals spot on.
- Hmm. When the generator cuts...
- We run on the batteries.
No, I mean, when it cuts, there may not be much time.
I see.
Ready?
Not a thing showing, not a damned thing.
But it's started. Listen to it down there.
- Shh!
- QUATERMASS: Roney!
I'm getting no visual impression.
I'll try a bit longer but I don't think it's operating through me.
Quatermass, try...
Did you get that?
- Yes, yes.
- Wait.
- Now.
- Yes, Quatermass.
It's getting too much for me.
We're not getting you. Shout louder.
I'll have to come out of here.
It's getting too much for me.
I'm coming out!
Let me.
- I can see.
- Barbara!
Quatermass, what's happening?
Roney, it's Barbara. She's the one!
Get down here, quick.
I can see.
Try this.
I can see. I can see!
I can... I can...
I can see.
She's getting something!
Hold me!
Hold me! Hold me!
You're all right. You're all right. Well done.
Well, did you manage to get it?
Yes. I saw them too, on the monitor.
Good. I think now we may have something to show Colonel Breen.
What you're about to see is a memory.
Stored for millions of years in the very substance of that hull, and now picked up by the susceptible brain of this young woman here.
Highly receptive, like the man Sladden.
- More than most of us.
- And what do you claim this will show?
A race purge.
A cleansing of the Martian hives.
Tape ready?
Yes. (CLEARING THROAT)
Most curious.
Those were like the creatures you found?
The same.
You saw that they were killing and being killed.
I think we may have witnessed ritual slaughter, to preserve a fixed society, to rid it of mutations.
Good heavens!
That's the way they lived.
And it's the way they intended their substitutes on Earth to live.
Not again!
My concern is, sir, that this stored memory of killing should be coupled with another power that thing in the pit seems to possess.
The power to redirect human energy.
MINISTER: A power to...
QUATERMASS: Into force beyond control.
- Nonsense!
- Well, we've all felt it.
- You have yourself.
A few vibration effects.
Now, now, gentlemen.
There's no need for this.
We're looking for rational explanations, and there is one.
This truly remarkable apparatus of yours was surely set to detect, was it not, hallucinations?
BREEN: Hallucinations. Exactly, sir.
All right, then, call it a mental image.
Now this young lady certainly has an imagination and she's overwrought.
She's seen the creatures that Colonel Breen insists are fakes.
So, what could be more natural than...
No, sir. You mustn't dismiss it like that.
You prefer that I dismiss
Colonel Breen's theory?
But if you'd been there, if you'd witnessed it all!
Professor Quatermass, I don't believe that you're right in this matter.
You are ridiculously wrong.
You're going to admit people to the excavation?
Yes, tonight.
The press, radio and television.
No, sir. You must not!
My duty now is to quieten public alarm.
And you, up to now a government officer with the same duty, you'll keep your damned paws out of things!
There's a heck of a lot of stuff down there.
Far more than I expected.
All those lamps and TV cameras.
Our generator will take all the load they can put on it, don't worry.
The cameraman want to take some shots inside the thing.
Can you fix them up?
Light the inside? Why not?
I'll get them to run out a further extension.
Right.
And the West German Federal Government has kindly agreed to make a further search of existing wartime records with a view to finally identifying this missile.
HOWELL: Copies of
Colonel Breen's statement are available for those who haven't one.
Now, before we take you down to see for yourselves, any questions?
Yes. Are you sure it's safe?
(CHUCKLING) Quite safe.
Any more questions? Otherwise...
Yes. I've got a question.
Is Colonel Breen just a fool or a coward?
What do you mean by...
- How...
- Just one second.
Professor, I thought it was clearly understood...
Is the Colonel afraid?
So afraid that he resorts to the thinnest rationalisation?
I say what I know to be the truth!
Well, tell them what you've seen down there.
Potter, you were a witness. You tell them.
Sir, we found...
My mate, he's in there!
Potter, be careful.
It's safe. The power's been cut.
I didn't mean that.
- What happened?
- He had the live cable.
He must have slipped!
Right, stand back, please.
Keep clear! Stand back!
He's dead.
It was an accident.
I couldn't help him.
There was nothing I could do.
- I know.
- He was fixing the junction box.
All right, all right!
- It was an accident.
- It may not have been.
What did you say?
Are you trying to make out it was my fault?
Get those lights on!
Hey, put the breakers back in.
Yeah, all except the line to the hull.
What's she doing there?
What is it?
It's coming alive.
It's glowing.
I don't see anything.
I did. Before the lights came on.
Breen, you've got to send everyone out of this place.
What, just because there's been an accident?
No, there's some new activity starting in that thing!
Listen, I'm advising you all to leave.
There may be grave danger.
What's the matter? What's wrong?
Well, you've seen what's happened to the electrician, haven't you?
Gentlemen, gentlemen, the official arrangements will proceed as planned, whenever you are ready.
And now we're taking you over to Hobbs End Underground Station.
Three streets away and we got to see it on the telly.
I tell you, people don't believe nothing nowadays unless they've seen it on the telly.
Edgar, do you believe in these Martians?
Be your age, Kitty.
Good evening. I'm standing just a few yards from where the mysterious missile was dug...
Colonel Breen, perhaps you should...
I'm sorry. Something's wrong here.
MAN: Now they've gone and mucked it up.
KITTY: Funny noises.
EDGAR: Vision on sound that's all.
Have another drink.
KITTY: Yes, I will.
I'm sorry, something seems to have gone wrong with our vision.
You must get away from here.
I tell you, this could be dangerous. Get back!
Get back!
Constable, get these men back from here.
Get back! Get back!
What's he doing there?
Constable, get that man out of here!
Stop panicking! Pull yourselves together!
For God's sake, don't panic!
Got to make a report.
Sir! You must get away from here. Sir!
Quatermass! Quatermass!
Don't you know me?
Roney.
That's better.
Go on, sit down.
Here. It's no way to serve decent whisky, but we're a bit low on glasses.
Now get that inside you.
You stopped me?
That's right. I stopped you.
You were being carried along, so I thought I'd better.
Were they... people?
What?
Of course they were.
- Don't you feel it?
- Feel what?
- Here. Anything?
- No.
Perhaps some are immune. Some few.
I...
I was just leaving the Institute,
I heard shouting in the distance.
It was what I was afraid of.
The thing got a huge intake of energy.
The very substance of it seemed to be coming alive.
And then...
Then you can't see this world any longer!
It's like that now?
No, not so bad now.
Quieter.
Was there anybody left there?
Breen.
It's changing. I can feel it.
It's getting stronger.
Quatermass! No!
Quatermass, no!
It's taking possession of you.
Fight it.
Fight it!
Can you hear what I'm saying?
Think, man, think.
Use your brain. Your memory.
Keep hold.
Yes.
My name is Bernard Quatermass, professor of physics, controller, British Experimental Group.
At present, engaged in...
Engaged in...
I wanted to kill you.
I could have done without moving.
Without trying.
I knew that. And I would have done.
Why? Did you know why?
Because you are different.
I could feel that. You had to be destroyed.
Destroyed.
Listen!
Animals! They're killing the animals.
No, not only animals.
This is the image that was buried in the hull.
The compulsion to preserve their colony.
Destroy all that didn't belong to it.
Draining the whole energy of London to turn it into a Martian colony.
They can't possibly, after so long.
They can. I can feel it. See it. See them.
Resist it. You must!
Come on. We've things to do that maybe nobody else can.
It's the Devil. The horned Devil.
Don't look at it!
Over there.
RONEY: Mass into energy.
The focus of all that's happening.
The cause. Oh, God!
God!
What can we do? Roney, what can we do?
Mass into energy. The fundamental law.
It must be.
- What?
- The Devil’s enemy was iron.
It might make sense if it were possible to project a mass of metal into it, connected to the ground.
Discharge it to the Earth?
- Yes.
- No, it's too simple.
But it's what they'd never allow for, even that scrap of knowledge in minds that were free to use it.
That crane.
I'll try.
- No.
- Yes!
You'll have to go round and stop her.
Huh?
You'll have to go round and stop her.
Barbara!
Roney!
Roney.
