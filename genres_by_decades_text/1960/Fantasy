- Hello.
- [Woman] Long distance for Scott Campbell.
- This is Scott Campbell.
- One moment, please.
Scotty, this is Joe. Joe Schiller.
How you been?
Fine, Joe. Fine.
- How's Nancy?
- She's fine. She's in bed.
Oh.
I guess I got you up, huh?
I was gonna call you tomorrow, but I have to go out of town.
I'll get right to the point,
Scotty.
- Would you be free to do a job for me right away?
- Maybe. What kind of a job?
Well, it's, uh, sort of a survey, but it could lead to something.
You know the Rochester Castle up in the hills, off the coast highway?
- I've read about it. I've never actually seen it.
- Not many people have.
Anyway, my firm represents the Rochester estate.
The castle's been out on lease about 10 years.
The lease has run out.
They've got a white elephant on their hands.
They want an architect to go up there and make a survey... condition of structure, possibility of conversion or remodeling.
- Maybe demolition.
- When would they want me to start?
You and Nancy drive up tomorrow.
You should be able to get there by late afternoon.
There's a real estate office about two miles from the turnoff... run by a guy named Quimby.
Get the keys from him.
You'll be better off staying at the castle.
It's quite a ways to a motel.
I'll be out of town tomorrow, but Loy and I will drive up and join you on Saturday.
- Hey, that's right. You haven't met Loy, have you?
- No. No.
Well, good.
We'll have a celebration.
Thanks. I just had one.
Today's our anniversary.
Congratulations.
So, we, uh... we got a deal?
We got a deal, Joe.
And thanks.
Ah, what are friends for?
See you Saturday.
- Good night, Scott.
- Good night.
[Line Clicks]
[Handset Settles In Cradle]
You can come out now.
I answered it.
- Who was it?
- Joe Schiller.
Joe Schiller?
What's he doing here?
He's not here.
He's in Los Angeles.
Just called to wish you a happy anniversary.
I'll bet.
It's kind of funny, isn't it?
I mean, we haven't seen him since... since we got married.
Must be that fine legal mind of his.
But that's not why he really called.
He offered us a job.
What kind of a job?
It's an architectural survey of a place up the coast.
An old pile called the Rochester Castle.
- You mean the one that crazy heiress built?
- Uh-huh.
Actually, it's, um, more early
Hollywood Spanish than a castle.
But she was supposed to have built some dungeons down in the basement or something.
What do they expect to do with it?
That's what they want us to find out.
Joe asked us to drive up tomorrow.
Tomorrow? You mean, like in a couple of hours?
Pretty long drive.
We'll never make it.
Good night, Frank Lloyd Campbell.
Well, it doesn't look quite the same... but I'm sure this is the road that leads up to the place.
If I could just see the lake,
I'd know.
Even if it is, we don't have the keys to get in.
I don't want to be a spoilsport, but why don't we go back and find the real estate office.
We didn't pass it on the way up, so it must be north of here.
About two miles, Joe said.
Let's take a ride up this road and see if I'm right.
Oh, come on.
Where's your spirit of adventure?
It's not my spirit of adventure
I'm worried about.
It's your sense of direction.
Live dangerously, huh?
I'm pretty sure this is the place.
I think we'd better walk it.
You said the lease had just run out.
Doesn't look like anyone's lived around here for years.
All I know is whatJoe told me, honey.
Let's have a look.
There's a lake.
This has to be it.
How did you know there was a lake, Scott?
Have you been up here before?
No, but there were pictures in the paper when they put Priscilla Rochester away.
What had she done?
Never really came out, honey.
Family declared her incompetent and put away.
Then they cleaned up whatever was going on before anyone could check it.
They must be quite a family.
Onward and upward, Mr. Campbell.
[Scott] Now, why would anyone build
a thing like that in this godforsaken spot?
- Locked.
- Is that the only door in?
As far as I know.
Supposed to be an elevator in here that goes to the top.
And that's the only road in.
She built this thing like a fortress.
What's in there?
Can't see a thing.
Well, I guess we'd better go back... and find that real estate office.
[Clears Throat]
It's a funny thing... airline hostesses, department store buyers, secretaries... they look all pretty much the same when you come right down to it.
- What can I do for you folks?
- I'm Scott Campbell, and this is Mrs. Campbell.
Oh, of course, of course.
Mr. Schiller called about you. I'm Mr. Quimby.
Come on.
Sit down, won't you?
Now, I suppose you came by for the keys to the Rochester place?
Yes.
Well, I'm glad you got here during daylight...
'cause it gets spooky up there at night if you don't know the way.
- Mr. Schiller said that you might be staying up there.
- That's right.
Well, there's a store a little ways down the road.
You can get groceries there.
Gas and lights still on.
No phone though.
- You're welcome to use mine
if you have to make a call.
- Thanks very much.
You, uh, don't happen to be superstitious, do you, ma'am? l-I don't think so.
You count 'em.
Go ahead.
Count 'em.
Thirteen.
You see? You see?
Fifty doors in the place, and only 13 keys.
Of course, they'll open everything.
Uh, Mr. Quimby...
I understand someone was leasing the castle.
That's right... for the past nine years.
- The lease ran out last month.
- Who was it?
Well, an old screwball... an old fella named Arbuckle.
Captain Sam Arbuckle, he called himself.
I understand he made his money in tent shows.
He retired up there.
- Why'd he leave?
- Search me.
Haven't seen much of him lately.
Never did see much of him.
Last two months of the lease he paid in advance.
And then he just up and walked away from it.
Didn't even turn in his keys.
That's a duplicate set you got there.
- Didn't anyone ever try to find him?
- What for?
Captain wanted his privacy the same as old Priscilla.
Well, we'd better get going.
- Thanks for the keys.
- Glad to oblige.
Anything I can do for you, just let me know.
You don't have a picture of Priscilla Rochester, do you?
After what Scott told me,
I just wondered what she looked like.
If I had one, Mrs. Campbell,
I'd be happy to show it to you.
As far as I know, there are no pictures of Priscilla Rochester.
Let's see. The last time I saw her was about four years ago.
I thought they had put her away.
They did.
She got out a few times.
Those fancy rest homes are not exactly Alcatraz, you know.
- Yes. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Quimby.
- You're welcome.
Scott, you just moved it an hour ago.
Somebody put it back.
[Engine Off]
Let's take a look at the place first.
I'll bring the stuff up later.
This is gonna be a real guessing game.
[Sighs]
You don't have to be polite.
I'll follow you.
Uh-huh.
[Chuckles]
Well!
Come into my parlor.
Scotty, isn't this really something?
If you like early Dracula.
I wonder what's up here.
I don't know.
- Let's find the elevator.
- Don't you want to try the stairs?
Tomorrow, hon.
It's getting late.
Even our own elevator.
- Ours?
- Well, there's nobody else here. Come on.
Isn't that terrific?
Wouldn't children love it?
Well, I don't imagine there's ever been a child in this house.
Shall we have a look?
[Cat Meowing]
Do you hear what I hear?
- Sounds like we have company.
- [Meowing Continues]
[Meowing Continues]
Ohh.
The poor thing must be half starved.
He looks pretty well-fed to me.
Oh, Scotty!
Okay, bring it along.
There's some milk in the car.
[Whispers]
It's okay, kitty.
So many beautiful things from all over the world.
Yeah.
There's supposed to be a warehouse full of stuff they took out of here... somewhere in L. A... if it hasn't been sold off.
Hey, what time is it?
About dinnertime.
You hungry?
I'm just beginning to get interested... after last night.
Well, why don't you wait here... and I'll see if a key on here will unlock a bedroom we can use.
- Then we'll go down and get our things.
- Okay.
Don't be long now.
[Crash]
[Crash]
[Twig Snaps]
Scott?
Scotty?
Where are you?
Here I am, honey.
Come here.
Wanna show you something.
[Gasps]
What do you think of it?
It's like something out of Dickens.
Well, you ain't seen nothin' yet.
And how do you like this?
Oh!
I thought we could make it our headquarters while we we're here.
Office, home, dining room, bedroom, all in one.
- I can set my board up over here.
- It's very cozy.
We'd better get to bed before you fall asleep.
[Moans]
- You awake?
- Mm-hmm.
Up we go.
- I'm not asleep.
- Well, prove it.
Care for one more day-after-our-anniversary toast?
Mm-mmm.
I'm for bed.
If you drop that, the estate'll sue.
Scott, one of the statues fell on the patio while I was upstairs.
- Did it break?
- All over. It's a mess.
Don't worry about it.
We'll clean it up in the morning.
Now, um, which bed do you want?
- [Click]
- [Meows]
[Yowls]
[Moans]
[Sighs]
[Meows]
[Shuffling]
Scotty!
- What is it? What's the matter?
- The door... it moved.
You stay here.
The lights are out.
Scotty, don't go out there.
Can't see a thing.
Oh, it's, uh, probably just a fuse.
I'll throw another log on the fire.
That'll do us for tonight.
Scotty, I think we ought to lock the doors.
I'll get the keys.
- I'll do it as soon as I fix the fire.
- No, I'll get them.
Fine watchdog you are.
Scott.
The keys are gone.
Honey, they weren't in the kitchen.
I couldn't find 'em anywhere.
Well... we're gonna look like darned fools... but I think we'd better, uh, go see if old Quimby's got another set.
- He said the ones he gave us were the duplicates.
- But what else can we do?
You don't suppose the police would help.
Honey, I'm not about to go tell the police...
I think someone snuck in my bedroom and took a bunch of keys.
They have a lot of trouble with kids breaking into old places like this.
They said anything, they'd just say it was a bunch of teenagers.
Well, under the circumstances...
I don't imagine the Rochester family... would like the police prying around here anyway.
That you can say again.
They have their own police.
Literally.
Oh, well, I think we'll get you a sweater and go see Quimby.
Okay.
Honey, I can get it.
Do you need anything?
- No.
- Okay.
Scotty!
Where'd you find 'em?
On the floor, under the night table.
Do you suppose they could have been there all the time?
Scotty, you know they weren't.
You looked yourself.
Wouldn't be the first time I missed something right under my nose.
Well, I doubt you could miss a ring of keys like that.
Okay then.
While we were out on the patio... somebody or something walked in here and put 'em back.
Is that what you want me to say?
What's the matter?
Scotty, count them.
That's old man Quimby's line.
Count them!
Eleven?
There were 13 when Mr. Quimby gave them to me.
You saw me count.
Well, this is... this is probably just some sort of prank, honey, some joke.
But if there is any danger,
I don't want you to stay here.
- What about the survey?
- It'll keep. We can come back later.
What if we can't?
What if they get somebody else?
Well, then... we've lost the job, that's all.
I think we oughta stay, at least untilJoe gets here.
Oh, honey, we've waited too long for a chance like this.
The Rochesters are the most creative builders in California.
You could have a ball designing for them.
- We could have a ball.
- You said it. I didn't.
Should we get our tape and start measuring?
All right, but, uh,
I wanna try something first.
There are two keys missing out there.
Let's find out which two rooms someone doesn't want us to see.
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Sighs]
Looks like we found one of them.
Are you sure you tried all of the keys?
One place down here we haven't tried yet.
What now?
[Doorbell Rings]
Hello.
- You're Scott Campbell?
- Yes.
Where is Joe?
How do you do?
Uh, where's Joe?
Isn't he here?
Oh, you're Mrs. Schiller.
- I thought you and Joe were coming together.
- So did I.
- You haven't seen him then?
- No.
Oh, excuse me.
This is my wife Nancy.
How do you do again?
I'm Loy Schiller, Joe's wife.
How do you do? Would you like to take your things upstairs?
I don't know. lfJoe isn't here...
Oh, he'll be along.
He had to go out of town on business.
Yes, that's what he told me also.
Well...
Thank you.
Isn't this nice?
Just like being home. Almost.
Well, we like the fireplace, and it is big enough for Scotty's things.
Oh! I forgot.
You're the, um... architect, no?
- Yes.
- Am I keeping you from working? Sorry.
Oh, no need to be.
We've just come to do a little measuring.
- Haven't even started yet.
- You help him with this?
Well, let's just say
I hold one end of the tape.
- It must be nice working with your husband.
- You'll have to ask him that.
Oh, I don't have to.
Not you two.
Go do your measuring.
[Gasps]
Is this your cat?
No.
She comes with the house.
Perhaps I should find you another room, if you're staying.
I don't know if we're staying.
You'll have to askJoe.
- Well, we'll be close by if you need anything.
- Thank you.
[Sighs]
Sounds likeJoe needs a marriage counselor more than he needs an architect.
Well, all he's got here is an architect.
I'm keeping my nose out of it.
Where do you suppose he is?
I was wondering that myself.
Six feet, 11 inches.
Let's get this one.
- Well, hello down there.
- Hi.
- Oh, I borrowed a towel. I hope it's all right.
- Of course.
I decided to sunbathe while you're working.
If I'd known you were coming,
I'd have arranged for a swimming pool.
To tell you the truth,
I swim on the bottom.
- How do you say? Like a rock.
- [Laughs]
I don't imagine you get too many complaints.
Thank you.
Well, there's a chaise lounge right on the patio.
[Door Opens]
- Let's leave the foreign aid to Washington, hmm?
- [Door Closes]
[Door Closes]
- Can I fix you some lunch?
- Oh, thank you.
It's late.
I won't have lunch today.
So I won't be... how do you say it?
Like a barn door.
[Nancy]
I think I'll diet with you.
America is the only place where people worry about eating too much... instead of not enough.
Well, now that lunch is over...
we might as well get back to work.
Six feet, four and one half inches.
[Groans]
If I do much more bending, my knees are gonna give out.
Just one more measurement, and then we'll have the floor done.
[Loy]
Are you finished?
It's getting cold.
I think I'll change.
What are you doing with all those numbers?
Well, you see, before I can make my survey...
I have to make the floor plan of each level.
- Oh. You draw that on the board downstairs?
- Later on.
You haven't seen Joe yet?
- Mm-mmm.
- Ooh!
Somebody's going to catch it.
- Just think... you might have married him.
- [Door Closes]
Now, really, lover. I just wanted some people I know to think that.
Touché.
And on that note,
I think I'll fix us some drinks.
Oh.
- We never did finish the other measurement.
- Let's save the knees, shall we?
We didn't find that other room either.
There were two keys missing, remember?
Honey, by the time we finish this measuring, we'll find it. Don't worry.
- Now, are you ready for that drink?
- I guess so.
[Gasps]
[Exhales]
Oh, it's you!
- You made me jump.
- Hello, Nancy.
Well, Joe!
How are you?
Fine, Scotty.
Good to see you.
We've been waiting for you.
- How did you get in?
- Well, the downstairs door was open.
Look, uh, why don't you two go ahead and sit down. I was gonna get some drinks.
Good.
I could use a drink.
Where's Loy?
I, uh, saw her car outside.
Well, she went down to our room to change.
She's been waiting for you too.
Yes, I know. I was supposed to pick her up, but she'd already left.
Well, perhaps she misunderstood.
Was she, uh, all right?
I mean... how did she feel?
Well, she seemed very nice to me.
She's been sunbathing most of the afternoon.
Well, it's getting dark.
What do you say we turn on some lights?
- Oh, uh...
- What's the matter?
The lights went out last night.
Scotty was going to fix them.
Oh?
[Chuckles]
- Looks like he already did.
- Well, he couldn't have. I've been with him all day.
- Anniversary wine.
- [Joe] Oh, fine.
Scott, did you, uh, fix the lights?
Lights? No. Why?
Well, it must have been a power failure.
Well, let's sit down and have some wine in the country.
I got a couple of jugs in the car.
I'll get them later.
Must have been spooky around here last night without any lights.
There have been a lot of little spooky things around here, Joe.
I wanna talk to you about 'em.
Well, here's to crime.
Or to old acquaintance.
I'll drink to that.
How very nice.
Old school friends.
You, uh, want to explain where you've been?
- I told you I'd pick you up.
- You're so polite, Joe.
- Such a gentleman.
- I asked you a question.
You're very good at asking questions.
Always the little lawyer.
- Sit down, Loy.
- I will not sit down.
You tell me you go to Santa Barbara, so I call your room.
- Loy, I told you...
- I call your room, and who answers?
I tell you who answers.
A girl!
Some kind of a girl.
- Sit down. Let's talk this thing...
- I will not sit down.
Loy.
- I'm sorry.
- Joe, do you want me to go down and talk...
No, no. Thanks, Nancy.
She's like a Roman candle.
I'll do it later.
She's right, in a way.
There was a woman in the room.
An ex-girlfriend of one of our senior partners who'd like to be single again.
You see, our firm doesn't like divorce cases, so I was...
I was asked to handle it quietly.
Well, I don't see anything so wrong with that.
The last one was pretty messy.
I promised Loy
I wouldn't take any more.
You didn't have to do it, did you?
No.
But let's face it... that's one way junior partners eventually become senior partners.
Why don't you run down and talk to her?
Because that's just what she wants me to do.
[Whimpering]
[Screams]
[Screaming]
[Buzzing]
I'll get her.
If she'd gone, we'd have heard her car.
We're six stories high.
You can't hear anything up here.
Come along then.
Maybe it'll help.
It's locked. I must have snapped something when I came in.
If it's locked, how would Loy get out?
If she slammed it, it probably locked by itself.
Well, if I know her, she slammed it, all right.
Well, her car's still here.
She, uh, must be in the house somewhere.
If she found the door locked, she must have gone up the stairs.
- Where do they lead?
- Just up to the top floor.
Well, back where we started from.
Scott, I'm worried.
Loy's angry with me.
She's probably just trying to get even.
She does things like that.
No, no, Joe.
There's been something wrong ever since we got to this place.
Who put the barricade back up? Who took the keys? Why the locked room upstairs?
I say, let's get the police up here
and open that door.
Now, wait a minute, Scotty.
The Rochesters spent a fortune trying to keep the police out of here.
Do you realize what fools we'd look like if Loy should walk in and say, "Surprise"?
Mm-hmm.
What about the locked room?
What about it?
It's probably empty.
But if we call the police in, the whole thing will be reported.
I'd like to try explaining that one at the office Monday.
- Joe...
- Scotty, it's all right for you to play independent.
You probably got a dozen architectural jobs waiting if you blow this one.
But I'm committed.
Joe, you know I don't.
But there's something wrong around here... whether Loy is playing hide-and-seek with you or not.
Let's start with the old man...
Uh, Captain what's-his-name... Arbuckle.
- What do you know about him?
- Not very much.
Supposed to be a colorful old character.
Liked his privacy.
I don't understand why nobody's ever looked for him.
Why should they? He paid his rent, left the place in good order.
How do you know he left?
And what about the old lady, Priscilla Rochester?
Don't worry about her.
They've got her locked up.
But Mr. Quimby said she'd escaped before, and that she came here.
All right.
Now, what do you want me to do?
[Chuckles]
Look, Joe.
I know how you feel about publicity...
I don't want it any more than you do.
But if we can't call the police...
I think we oughta start investigating... the various possibilities ourselves.
For a starter,
I'd like to call the sanitarium... and see if our Priscilla Rochester is present and accounted for.
Well, I suppose the smart thing for us to do would be to leave.
Can't very well do that till we find Loy.
They wouldn't talk to you at the sanitarium.
Want me to do it?
- There's no phone here.
- I know, but I can run down and use Quimby's.
I wish you would, Joe.
Well, I guess the least I can do is try to keep peace in your family.
Oh, incidentally, Joe...
still a secret, what the old lady did
to make 'em put her away?
It's still a secret.
But there's no harm in telling you, I suppose.
She killed a man with a shotgun she kept to scare off trespassers.
- Who was it?
- I don't know.
Some man who wandered up here.
Some bum nobody ever heard of.
He never was identified because she, uh... she blasted his head off.
[Engine Starts]
Operator, would you get me the number of the Brady Sanitarium in DeJur?
Thank you.
Yes?
- [Operator: Faint]
Thank you.
Oh, uh, could you get the number for me?
If you would, please.
You think the old lady flew the coop again, eh?
[Rings]
Brady Sanitarium.
[Phone: Joe, Faint]
- Well, who are you?
- [Joe Continues, Faint]
I see.
Well, you don't have to worry.
I checked her myself less than an hour ago.
I wish you'd check her again.
It's quite important.
- [Nurse, Faint]
- I know that, but these aren't the customary conditions.
I don't want to send someone out there at this time of night.
All right, Mr. Schiller... if that's what you want.
I'll be right back.
She's gone to have a look.
I'd, uh, like to keep this between you and me.
If she's there, there's no need for anyone to know about this call.
I got you.
You don't have to worry about me.
Spying! I caught you spying!
[Screams]
Always spying!
[Screaming Continues]
What do you suppose she's doing?
Spying! Spying! Spying!
I'll get you!
You don't have a thing to worry about, Mr. Schiller.
Miss Rochester is in her room, in bed.
I see.
You're absolutely sure?
[Nurse, Faint]
Good night.
[Doorbell Rings]
Did you hear something?
- [Doorbell Rings]
- Oh, Joe must be back. Front door's locked.
Scotty, what are you going to tell him?
What can I tell him?
We've almost searched the whole house and haven't found her.
He seems to be taking it rather calmly so far.
Yeah.
Well, maybe he found out something. l... I'll wait here.
I'd rather you told him.
All right.
But you stay put.
Okay.
- Did you find Loy?
- No.
I checked with the sanitarium.
The old lady's in bed in her room.
What the devil could have happened to Loy?
She must be in the house somewhere.
Nancy and I have been looking ever since you left. There's no sign.
Let's get back.
I don't want to leave her alone.
[Screams]
Honey. What's the matter?
What happened to you?
[Trembling]
It looked like Loy.
- Did you see her?
- [Gasping]
Where did you see her?
Huh? Honey, tell me where you saw Loy.
[Stammering]
In... In the last room at the end of the hall.
Is this the door?
Are you sure that's the room?
There's nothing in there.
It's empty.
Honey.
Honey, are you sure you didn't make a mistake?
Nancy, how did you see Loy?
I mean, what was she doing? l-I don't know. l-I thought I did, but I just don't know.
It's all right.
All right.
Here, sit down.
Give her a few minutes, Joe, and then we'll find out what it's about.
- Oh, Scott, did you check all the rooms?
- Yeah.
- What about the one upstairs, the one that was locked?
- Not that one.
- Still can't get in.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, what do you say you and
I have a look before we call the cops?
I've already kicked in one door tonight.
One more won't hurt.
All right.
Honey, come here.
Come on.
Honey, I want you to lie down until we get back... and I want you to lock the door from the inside with this key.
- Leave the key in the lock. Okay?
- Okay.
We won't be more than a couple minutes.
[Lock Clicking]
Scott, what do you suppose...
I don't know, Joe.
Let's get it over with.
I wanna get her out of here.
- How's your shoulder?
- All set.
Scott.
My God.
Must be the old man...
Captain Arbuckle.
Murdered in bed.
There's nothing we can do, so let's go.
Scott. Scott.
Do you suppose Loy is...
The police'll find her, Joe.
Now, come on.
[Knocking]
Nancy, it's me, Scott.
Unlock the door.
Come on, honey.
We're gonna go to the police.
We just found the old captain upstairs.
He's dead.
You two go ahead.
I'm gonna keep looking for Loy.
All right.
We'll be right back.
I'd feel a lot better if you had a gun.
Lawyers don't carry guns.
Their clients do.
- The 13th key.
- What?
Honey, we have one more place to look.
GetJoe for me, huh?
- Oh, Scotty, I don't...
- Look, nothing's going to happen to me.
Now, please getJoe.
I think I know where Loy is.
Come on.
That's enough!
Leave him alone!
It's all right.
Go now.
Why, you're... you're all a...
You can say it, Mr. Campbell.
Freaks.
No. I was gonna say carnival people.
Captain Arbuckle owned a carnival.
A circus.
A small one, but it was a circus.
But you...
You mean, he hid you here... when he retired?
I was his housekeeper, cook.
We took the others in when they needed help.
But we never let anyone know because of his lease.
[Woman]
You can come down now.
- Oh, Scotty!
- What have you done with my wife?
We haven't done anything with your wife, Mr. Schiller.
That's why you're here.
He'll show you.
But you must be lying.
I saw her.
What you saw... was a combination of two old sideshow illusions... the Locked Room and the Headless Woman.
The captain has others stored down here... a mermaid, spider-girl.
It's all done with mirrors.
You've probably seen them dozens of times.
- What have you done to her?
- Just a sleeping pill.
She's very excitable.
Is that the way you killed Captain Arbuckle?
Mr. Schiller, the captain was the only friend we had.
We didn't kill him.
He died one night in his bed, peacefully.
As you can see,
it isn't easy for us.
The captain took us in many years ago... when the sideshows began to break up.
When he died, we just locked the door.
We didn't know what else to do.
Well, you, uh... you could have called a doctor.
You didn't explain to them.
We had nowhere to go.
We needed time to think, to plan.
When you came, we hoped to scare you away.
Where will you go?
Can we go?
The police will probably want to ask you a few questions.
What will they do to us?
Well, under the circumstances, I, uh...
I don't imagine anything.
Uh, as far as we're concerned...
you can go.
Come along.
It's time for us to leave.
Where will we go?
We'll have to find a carnival again.
It won't be so bad.
- The faces...
- Oh, come along. Come along.
We've all been looked at before.

All belief possibly could be said to be the result of some conditioning.

We Greeks, we know everything.
No, no. I just happened to be here.
I guessed.
Myrivilis. Also teacher of English.
I hope you'll call me Meli.
That's Greek for "honey".
My nickname.
Uh, you must be tired.
The school is not far from here.
- Did you have a nice journey?
- Yes.
I'm sorry you are here in such sad circumstances.
- They told you in London?
- Yes.
We are very lucky to have you on such short notice.
I wanted to get out of England.
Why did this chap,
Williamson, kill himself?
A complete mystery.
After Christmas, he was a little strange, moody, but nothing.
About a month ago, he went to Athens for the weekend.
And the next thing we hear, he's dead.
A whole bottle of Seconal.
I hope you like simple pleasures.
Nothing to do here except swim... walk, drink ouzo.
No women.
- Good.
- Good?
Good.
It's not much, I'm afraid.
It'll do.
- Was this his room?
- I'm sorry. It was the only one-
Forget it.
- What's "The Waiting Room"?
- An evening duty perhaps.
Who knows?
Uh, the headmaster would like to see you later.
I've been hearing that sentence all my life.
He is going.
We are going.
You are going.
They are going.
Now, once through, on your own.
I am going.

You need this more than I do.
What's wrong?
I don't love you.
Deep down.
Deep, deep down in you...
There's somebody totally different.
That's who I love.
Nicholas, meet Anne.
My quite but absolutely favourite air hostess.
- And what's Nicholas?
- Now Nicholas is one of the new elite.
Impeccable background.
His father was a bus driver.
A bus conductor, actually.
Scholarship to university.
Cracked up. Bad degree.
Huge chip on his shoulder.
- Now classless, rootless.
- And jobless.
All the symptoms of contemporary genius.
I may even publish him one day.
I may even let him.
- He deserves it.
- Are you a writer?
I've got everything a poet needs... except poems.
I've got everything an air hostess needs... except illusions.
Twin spirits.
"We shall not cease from exploration.
"And the end of all our exploring...
"Will be to arrive where we started...
"And know the place for the first time".
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
I found this on the-
I chose well?
I built on the site of a medieval chapel.
Very nice. I came to return this.
You came hereto meet me.
Please, life is short.
My name is Conchis.
My name is Urfe.
From the school.
I find life long.
- Oh, tea is ready.
- How did you know-
There is a poem of the Tang Dynasty.
"Here on the frontier there are falling leaves.
"All of my neighbours are all barbarians.
"And you, you're a thousand miles away.
There are always two cups on my table".
Full of China tea?
The best darjeeling.
I believe you knew Williamson.
Oh.
My housekeeper, Maria.
My manservant, Andreas.
Please.
You did know him, didn't you?
Enjoy your tea, please.
Do you live here alone?
What some would call alone.
What was it?
Nothing.
I must go.
And you have a long walk.
Do you mind telling me now what the game is?
- The game?
- Yes.
I don't understand.
That's my line.
How did you know
I was coming over here today?
I am psychic.
I should like you to come next weekend and stay with me.
I think we have many things to discover.
- "We shall not cease from exploration".
- You read the passage.
- Wasn't it left for me to read?
- Until next weekend.
Thank you.
Tell no one over there you have met me.
Believe nothing they say.
They understand nothing.
They know nothing.
They mean nothing.
- How long have you known Conchis?
- Who?
The old nutcase who lives in the villa over on the south side.
Oh, come on.
It must have been you who told him I was going over there.
- But...
- Like Williamson.
Williamson? He never set foot out of the school.
You never met this man, Conchis?
Someone's been pulling your leg, my friend.
That villa belongs to a man from Athens - a Dr. Lambros.
- Just a minute, Meli-
- I remember now.
Yes, there was a man named Conchis, but he died years ago.
"Death is..."
Death is, like, not true.
- A lie.
- A lie.
Some people say he helped the Germans in the war.
But no one knows.
The truth-
I was admiring your gravestone the other day.
You have heard of a marriage of convenience?
There are also deaths of convenience.
- The war?
- Mm-hmm.
Aren't you taking a risk, telling me who you are?
Aren't you taking a risk coming back?
Knowing my name is Conchis is not quite the same... as knowing who I really am.
Do you like Modigliani?
Mmm, very impressive.
Bonnard.
Do you play some other instrument?
Of merely sentimental value.
These were done by some Byzantine.
Fra Angelico.
Oh. Same period.
It belonged to her.
We were once to be married.
She died during the first World War.
- I've missed you.
- Careful. You'll be in love next.
I never use four-letter words.
- Did you send out your application?
- Yes.
And you told them you're bringing your French mistress?
Of course.
How was the flight?
If one more dirty old man asks me to show him around swinging London-
But, darling, we need the money.
Honestly, if I didn't know you'd be here-
I must have a bath.
- Cigarettes?
- In my bag.
Why exactly do you carry a paperweight around?
Please put it back.
It's rather nice.
I think I'll keep it.
Please.
Another man?
It's... It's a sort of...
I never fly without it.
So...
About two years ago, I... had to have an abortion.
I wanted to kill myself.
One day I saw this in an antique shop.
It seemed to say something I needed.
Still need sometimes.
Go on.
It says... that right at the very heart of things... there's something not spoiled... un-betrayed.
Everything I'm not... and the world's not.
It's... what does an apple have?
A core?
It's the core.
- The core of what?
- Of everything.
It's the one thing
I shall never give away.
If I ever lost it,
I think I would die.
Is something wrong?
No.
It reminded you of someone.
Being psychic, Mr. Conchis?
One does not have to be that to see you are not the happiest of young men.
I am just a child of my century.
Now, I will show you something.
The ultimate reality.
Not the hammer and sickle, not the stars and stripes... not lysergic acid, not the sun... not gold, not yin and yang.
But...
the smile.
And what have you got in store for me now?
Shall we leave it to chance?
Let us see what the, uh, cards say.
The tarot.
You must cut three times.
Oh. The Hanged Man.
He stands for selfishness.
The High Priestess.
She stands for mystery and wisdom.
The Magus, or the Magician.
He stands for- for many things.
Oh. I think we need more brandy.
Who was that?
Who's just gone round there?
Questions are wasted on Andreas.
He's a mute.
- Who was it?
- Won't you sit down?
If you won't answer any of my questions... you could at least explain why.
I will explain many things if you pass the test.
Nicholas, how highly do you...
Value your life?
There's a fairly widespread impression...
Which I share, that it's not worth much.
Then you would risk death without any qualms?
Why not?
All men feel the need to risk death at least once in their life.
War is a very unscientific answer to that need.
If I had my way, all young men would go to a clinic... and throw a dice.
Numbers two to six would mean life.
Number one, death.
A painless death.
No mess, no cruelty... no destruction of innocents.
One throw of the dice.
These were issued to certain special agents during the war...
In case of interrogation.
Prussic acid.
Death is immediate.
A war in one second.
Wouldn't a corpse be rather embarrassing for you?
Not at all.
Another suicide.
If you mean what I think you mean... you go first.
I am not playing at make-believe.
Swear to me that if the number is one... you will take the pill.
Yes.
I congratulate you.
You have passed the test.
You refused to die on the throw of a loaded dice.
Many years ago, so did I.
I was an only child.
We lived in London.
I, uh...
I had the misfortune to be a musical prodigy.
No time for games or friends.
Instead...
Endless hours of practicing, practicing, practicing.
When I was 17...
In the year 1913...
We had new neighbours.
Her name was Lily.
It seemed as if we were destined.
She, too, was an only child.
She, too, was musical.
The happiest year of my life passed.
We became engaged.
There seemed no cloud on our horizon.
But a terrible cloud was forming...
In a little town called Sarajevo.
We were on the brink of the first World War.
The great majority of those who volunteered were like sheep.
They simply conformed.
I'd been brought up outside the flock.
So when Lord Kitchener pointed his finger at me...
I shook my head.
In short, Nicholas...
I decided as you decided a few minutes ago.
Of course, there was a difference.
On the table in 1914... these were real.
Not just kirsch... in coloured candy.
I tried to make Lily understand why I refused to enlist.
I poured out my feelings to her.
All the arguments, the reasons...
Why she must go with me to America.
But I was condemned.
Not by her, but by her idealism.
That look.
That last look, it will never be past.
It's in my every second till I die.
I selfishly thought there was always time on my side.
I would return.
I was young and I was wrong.
She died?
In the early hours of February 19, 1916.
There was a typhoid epidemic.
She was working in a hospital.
Poor girl.
Hmm. The dead live.
How?
By love.
No, no.
Nice work.
Ah, Nicholas.
I trust you slept well?
Very well.
It must have been the "Kleine Nachtmusik" that you and your friend provided.
You saw her?
Mr. Conchis, you don't expect me to believe-
I knew I was right the moment I saw you.
You cannot believe you are psychic.
That's normal.
Believing doesn't come into it.
I am not psychic.
I saw a girl, not a ghost.
Once bitten, twice shy.
She must like you.
Where is she?
I am not psychic.
Yours is a characteristic reaction of your century to disbelieve, to disprove.
You are like a porcupine.
When it has its spines up, it cannot eat.
If you do not eat, you will starve.
My dear Lily.
Oh, may I present Mr. Nicholas Urfe.
Miss Montgomery.
It is very warm.
Yes, it is.
Mr. Urfe is the young schoolmaster
I mentioned.
Teaching must be a most interesting profession.
Is there any news from Flanders?
Nothing of importance.
Maurice has told me of your weak heart. I am sorry.
I ventured to explain to Miss Montgomery why you were unable to volunteer.
I see. Thank you.
They also serve who only stand and teach.
Excuse me.
Been here long?
I've not been anywhere long.
I meant, uh, on the island.
Island? What island?
Excellent return of service,
Miss Montgomery.
- Come on.
- Come on where?
Which delightful old English county do you hail from?
Massachusetts?
California?
My father works for the Times.
Until two years ago, he was their American correspondent.
- I was brought up there.
- Two years ago being?
I'm surprised, Mr. Urfe, that a person of your education... is unable to subtract two from 1915.
Game and set.
Smoke? May I?
It cannot be very good for your heart.
I can pinch your bottom... or kiss you.
- Which shall it be?
- Mr. Urfe!
Do you love Maurice?
We all love him so deeply.
- We?
- His other visitors and myself.
You mean there are more ghosts?
Maurice does not like the word "ghost".
Or "actress"?
We're all actors and actresses,
Mr. Urfe.
You included.
Of course.
On the stage of the world.
Mr. Urfe is very understanding.
Understanding?
Nicholas, would you care for a cigar before you go?
- Thank you, yes.
- Would you, dear?
Your cigar, Mr. Urfe.
What is this?
What is what?
Okay.
I'll play-
I'd just enjoy it more if I knew what it was all about.
Man has been saying that for the last 10,000 years.
But the one common feature of all the gods he has said it to... is that not one has ever returned an answer.
- But why me?
- Why anyone?
Why anything?
I said I'll play, but not unless I know the rules.
Then, my friend, this world is not for you.
All right.
You win.
But you might tell me whether I'm your guest or your victim.
You are neither.
Is there any news from Flanders?
Nicholas? Nicholas?
Nicholas, wake up.
- What time is it?
Where were you last night?
I was just wandering about and I got lost.
What a shame.
Nicholas, I congratulate you.
She is charming.
She?
Anne.
Anne?
Last evening: She had just one hour before the boat went back.
What did she want?
Not forgiven.
Not forgotten.
Take it easy.
It's not the end of the world.
Just the end of the affair.
One day you'll meet someone much better.
By which you mean you think you will.
Somebody respectable and English.
On a remote Greek island?
You're running away.
That's all it is.
Look, in this country
I am the typical nowhere man- belonging nowhere, going nowhere and wanted nowhere.
Oh, Nicko, this is life, not an existentialist novel.
- We've discussed it.
- We've evaded it.
You'll miss your flight.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
That's what I can't forgive.
You're not sorry.
You are glad.
I don't love you.
Deep down.
Deep, deep down in you... there's somebody totally different.
That's who I love.
How would he behave?
- Marry you?
- Just take me with him.
I'll have to postpone my flight.
I can get back by Wednesday.
Okay.
I don't need it anymore.
Reservations, please.
Oh, my name is Nicholas Urfe.
And I have a seat to Athens... on Olympic Flight 063... for Wednesday.
I want to change it.
That's right.
Can you get me on tomorrow?
Fine.
Thank you.
She's flying the Middle Eastern route now.
She'll be in Athens the weekend after next,
Friday, 6:00, at the airport.
Thanks.
There was no one at the house.
Where are they?
You may sit down, but you must not wet my dress.
- Where are they?
- Give me your hand.
I'll read your fortune.
Your happiness line is very broken.
Bull's-eye.
And your soul line is very crooked.
I fear you are deceitful, Mr. Urfe.
What are you?
- His mistress?
- That is most rude.
Most ill-bred!
I want to be your friend.
You make it all so difficult.
I've never been in a lunatic asylum before.
How dare you!
How dare you!
Let me go!
It was only a joke.
Nicholas, it tolls for thee.
- Let it toll.
- You must go.
Come with me.
It doesn't toll for me.
Please. I'll wait here.
If that's a promise,
I want a guarantee.
Mr. Urfe, are you asking me to commit osculation?
From the Latin, osculum, meaning "mouth".
Where's Mr. Conchis?
Nicholas.
My apologies.
I was delayed on business in Athens.
Or just getting out of your costume.
So... well, sooner or later, it had to happen.
Of course Lily is no ghost.
And I am no more psychic than you are.
What are you doing to that girl?
My name is really Lambros.
I'm a psychiatrist.
This is my clinic.
This film shows her before she came under my care.
She was then at a clinic in Zurich.
This advanced type of schizophrenia... is usually considered hopeless.
And yet, look.
Here she is today.
And in great part because of you, Nicholas.
Still far from normal, God knows.
But not the terrible nothingness you saw in the clinic.
The fast developing is a contribution... of one of my most gifted students,
Dr. Soula Androutsou.
How do you do, Mr. Urfe?
You see how much Julie has improved under Dr. Lambros's care.
That is her real name - Julie Holmes.
But you must under no circumstances reveal that you know it.
Many of my colleagues find my theory highly suspect.
You see, it involves not checking...
But pandering to the patient's fantasies.
By turning monsters into play things, she escapes her condition.
Therefore, this morning's little trick.
- And all that 1915 stuff?
- Pure fantasy.
We are always trying to stimulate her invention.
We make a search for new ways to surprise and deceive.
What I can't understand is... how you could let anyone come blind into this.
I had no reason to discuss my patient with you before this... morning's episode.
Dr. Lambros fears a repetition of the Williamson affair.
So he was here.
Oh, yes.
And he fell in love with her.
I must tell you. Young female schizophrenics are often highly sexed.
He ran away with her.
Of course, we had to bring her back.
The shock could have killed her.
It killed him.
Didn't he realise she was a mental case?
Did you?
We are taking Julie to Zurich for some clinical tests.
We'll be back in about two weeks, perhaps sooner.
It'll give you time to decide if you wish to continue.
- I think I have decided.
- Hmm.
Then I must warn you.
No emotional involvement.
You see, Nicholas, you have been neither my guest nor my victim... but my colleague.
Catch me.
It's all right.
They want it to look as if we're falling in love.
Oh, for heaven sake, don't tell me you believed all that schizophrenic nonsense.
Come on.
Now listen.
They won't give us long.
First of all, I may be mad to be here, but I'm not here because I'm mad.
- Why then?
- There isn't time.
Anyway, you wouldn't believe anything I said.
- But my real name is Julie Holmes.
- I know. They told me.
Oh. I might have guessed.
Did he tell you his medical name?
Check that: Check anything about him that you can.
All I want you to realise is it's not just you who is the victim here.
We both are.
- Come away with me now then.
- We wouldn't get 50 yards.
Oh. Armed guards with Alsatians.
Of course not.
I could get away.
It's like being halfway through some fantastic book.
And now that you're part of it...
You must believe me.
- Is this how the script goes?
- The what?
You could be working for him.
- Bonjour, l'Angleterre.
- Bonjour, la France.
I thought you missed your plane.
I didn't think you would come.
Curiosity.
Just couldn't think why you'd wanna see a bastard like me again.
How are the dirty old men?
No younger and no cleaner.
And you?
Some lovely Greek peasant girl?
She gave me the weekend off.
Good. I want to do something mad.
The next time you say mad... remind me to remember that you mean it.
Hey!
Tell him we are dying of thirst.
You've got to drink.
It's an insult to refuse.
Finish it.
He's gonna get more for me.
I'll never be the same.
Just a minute.
Uh-
I told him I'd love a drink, but it's against doctor's orders.
Oh, you traitor.
Hey!
- What is it now?
- It's a cheese.
You take it.
Nicholas?
Right!
No!
- Mm.
- Now... for a long passionate kiss.
Water.
- It's freezing!
- Yee-haw!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Do you know how many men
I have slept with this year?
Fifty?
If I had slept with 50,
I'd just be an honest professional.
I suppose to you
I'm just like all the others.
I don't compare birds in the hand with birds in the bush.
But you are that sort.
- What sort?
- Just after bird.
You're not still a Catholic?
But I'm not just bird either.
Nicko?
I know what we are today... but what about tomorrow?
I have to go back.
I didn't mean that kind of tomorrow.
I know you didn't.
Still living that existentialist novel?
I've been trying to find a way to tell you.
It's a whole group of people I've met.
- But there is a girl?
- It's not as simple as that.
This thing, it's like being halfway through a book.
You can't just throw it in the dustbin.
- So you throw me instead?
- I'm trying to be honest.
Honest?
It's just like in London.
You haven't changed.
I'll always be that French girl who slept around.
A human boomerang.
Throw her away and she'll always come back for another week of duty-free sex.
- That's below the belt!
- Your natural territory.
Or so you think.
But let me tell you something.
If all I needed you for was that...
I'd have left you after the first night.
I'll walk out of my job tomorrow.
Or?
You say no, and for the last time.
- You can't just finish it like-
- Yes or no?
- Anne, if you'd only lis-
- Yes or no?
- You can't decide these things-
- Yes or no?
No.
Don't be so stupid.
Anne, let me in.
You'll never see me again.
Never!
Never again!
Anne!
Miss?
Please, I must speak to you.
We want to help you.
We arrive at Phraxos in a few minutes.
Father?
Do you remember telling me that Conchis helped the Germans during the war?
What did he do?
That beach - you see it?
That is where it started.
- Zigarette?
- Nein. Danke.
Achtung!
Because of that in your school, a great killing...
80 hostages, they say it was Conchis.
It was because of him.
Ah, Nicholas!
I told them you would return.
Oh, this is Dr. Anton Meyer from Zurich.
He is, uh, observing my methods.
Dr. Lambros has told me how valuable your assistance can be.
Anything to further medical knowledge.
How is the patient?
We feel very optimistic, provided we're all careful.
Well, you can depend on me.
Nicholas is very intelligent.
I think we can rely on his good judgment. Can't we?
Implicitly, Dr. Lambros.
You've come back!
Thank God.
- Did I ever say I wouldn't?
- No. But they did.
They said you'd gone back to England.
They told me you'd gone to Switzerland.
I've just met one of the doctors who treated you there.
Anton? He's no more a doctor than I am.
Did you check the name Lambros?
I knew I'd forgotten something.
You did.
Then you know everything
I've said is true.
Here. I wanna talk to you.
Isn't it time you stop making a fool of me?
It's my profession.
I'm an actress.
I studied in America.
But nothing happened for me, so I came to Europe.
I got one or two small parts in French pictures.
And then I had this offer to do a film on location in Greece.
You don't have to tell me the producer's name.
And the director was Anton.
We spent a week here on tests.
My dear Lily.
May I present Mr. Nicholas Urfe.
Miss Montgomery.
Anton played your part.
It is very warm.
We're surely not going to talk about the weather.
Mr. Urfe is the young schoolmaster
I mentioned.
That first meeting.
What happened then?
That's just it, absolutely nothing.
I never saw a script.
All the equipment vanished, all the crew.
And then one day...
Of course we intend to make the picture... but in a completely new way.
The leading actor, whom we have already selected, will not realise he is acting.
He'll have absolutely no idea what's happening.
- But surely he must see a script.
- Ah, on the contrary... we will not write a script until we have watched his reaction... to the role we will ask you to play.
- The days of set plots are over. Finished.
- Of course.
Julie, surely at drama school they taught you to improvise.
Julie, please.
Trust me? Hmm?
It seemed fun.
You came, I improvised, they were excited by your reactions.
But I don't understand what's going on anymore.
I even think they know you've guessed what I really am.
There's still no script, still no preparation for any kind of filming.
Well, haven't you asked him,
"What happens now?"
Of course, a thousand times.
My dear Julie, be patient.
Answers kill.
In a way,
I know what he means.
Do you remember being here before?
That day you disappeared.
I'll tell you when you're warm.
I don't know.
I give up.
Julie?
Julie?
Good Lord.
Did he have this built?
The Germans.
They were here during the war.
Maurice only had to make this.
Wasn't I more fascinating as a ghost?
The wardrobe department.
You know he's already taken film of us.
He can't have.
I've seen it.
- You and me on the jetty together.
- But it's impossible.
The cameras and the crew all disappeared before you came.
It was shot with a telephoto lens.
It's weird.
It's what I keep on feeling.
He's some kind of voyeur, and we're his puppets... his toys.
You are frightened.
Sometimes.
And sometimes...
I love every minute of it.
Nicholas, I can't.
Not here.
It's this feeling that he sees everything.
But you can never get away.
Well, as a matter of fact,
I think I could.
At night.
Not for long, but-
- Long enough?
- Mr. Urfe, are you asking me to commit-
I'll go into details of the crime when we meet.
There's a chapel in the forest.
Follow the path, okay?
Midnight. What day?
I'll send you a sign.
Fruit from the Garden of Eden.
Nicholas, I wonder if you would help me fell a dead pine.
And, dear, it's time for your treatment.
I don't want to go.
Come, come.
You will soon see Nicholas again.
I see she's revealed one of our little tricks to you.
Which of her fantasies has she been regaling you with this afternoon?
The incredibly innocent film actress... or something less far-fetched?
Nothing quite as far-fetched as Dr. Lambros... who doesn't appear in any medical register.
Well, how could he?
My name is Dr. Maurice Conchis.
Ah. I think when I marry,
I shall pray for daughters. And you?
I'll just pray for myself.
This was handed in at the gate, sir.
Oh, and there's a letter, sir.
You know what's wrong with marriage, Meli?
It kills the fun in life.
It's the timid, little people who can't gamble... who always want to know where they are.
It's for mice, Meli, not for men.
What is it? Nicholas?
Julie?
Julie, stop mucking about.
- Did you find a boat?
- What?
This way!
Hey, hey, what's going on?
Who the hell are you?
- Enjoying yourself?
- Good. Thank you.
Traitor!
Freedom!
Take them away.
My dear Nicholas.
Has something happened?
You know damn well what's happened.
I went to the chapel.
Chapel? What for?
I am sick of your mysteries.
Sick of pretense.
You are right.
Nothing here is what it seems.
- You have entered the Metatheatre.
- The what?
A theatre with no set plot, no set dialogue and no audience.
Our play is for the actors alone.
Some Greek millionaires find their pleasure inviting famous people on their yachts.
I... I prefer less banal amusements.
Amusements?
I hoped at least you would find them entertaining.
- Where's Julie?
- Ah.
A very promising actress, is she not?
She did not feel like performing this evening.
And you're the bloody director?
Directors do not appear on the stage.
What am I, the unpaid clown of the production?
You will not go unpaid.
I assure you of that.
Fine. Well, take a look at the latest bill for your amusements.
- Who was she?
- A girl I knew.
And if it hadn't been for you and your damn game, she'd still be alive.
She loved you?
I never realised how much.
- If I...
- My dear Nicholas.
Oh, if I'd only known.
I am most profoundly sorry.
Another death to add to your collection.
Wait!
What I said before is partly true.
But it is not true that we do what we do just for fun.
The chapel was to set the scene for something that proves that.
Something that may help you come to terms with this tragedy.
I beg you to sit down.
Please.
During the war here...
I, too, was cast as the clown of a production... in the theatre of real life.
I hated my role.
But it taught me the greatest lesson life holds.
In 1941, after the fall of Greece...
they sent a small German garrison to Rhraxos.
They set up an observation post here at the villa...
And took over your school for the headquarters.
One day, I was ordered to report to the garrison commandant...
- Captain Wilhelm Dietrich Wimmel.
- Ah, Herr Conchis.
He told me I was to be mayor.
I was given no choice.
For two years, nothing happened.
It seemed we were to be spared the worst horrors of the occupation.
Then one day in 1943...
One typical, calm
Aegean summer day...
The Germans had a system.
For each German killed by the Resistance...
20 civilians had to be executed.
We, therefore, owed them 80.
You know they were from... from Crete.
We have no partisans here in Phraxos.
But they were Greeks,
Herr Bürgermeister.
One of them, who had relatives in the village, went for help.
The other two hid.
Their comrade was unfortunate enough to be captured alive.
Gut. Danke schön.
Rrodotis!
Eleutherial!
Eleutheria is the noblest word in the Greek language.
It means "freedom".
The Greek for "traitor" is prodotis.
Herr Bürgermeister,
I wish certain information... from the leader of these murderers.
And he's being obstinate.
You, as mayor, will order him to speak.
Under Occupation Law,
I'm not obliged to be-
The only law on Phraxos now, lieber Herr Conchis, is my law.
Now, speak.
If you make him talk,
I will give you 80 lives.
Wimmel told me to ask him the name of his superior...
The methods by which partisans were smuggled from one island to the other...
Why they had come to Rhraxos...
What their real mission was.
As much as I hated asking him to cooperate with the Germans...
I was certain no information he was hiding could be worth 80 lives.
Eleutherial!
Well, I could make you watch the dialogue... between my men and this animal.
- No, thank you.
- Do you think I'm a sadist?
No, I'm a realist.
My purpose is a German historical purpose.
To bring order... into the chaos of Europe.
Hmm.
Herr Bürgermeister?
Order.
We will meet tomorrow.
Herr Bürgermeister.
The responsibility for the fate of these peasants rests with you.
I will change the sentence of death to deportation... on one condition.
That is...
That you yourself carry out the execution of these three murderers.
It's forbidden for Greeks to have loaded weapons.
But I don't understand.
Well, you have 15 seconds to understand.
Ten seconds.
Eleutherial...
Eleutheria.
Fire!
You see what he had condemned me to.
Alive, I could be only one thing...
a collaborationist.
That is why Maurice Conchis had to die.
What would you have done?
- God knows.
- God never has to choose.
You and I do.
You have one death on your conscience.
I have 80.
More than 80.
No, no more, my friends.
Our activities for this year must come to an end.
Madame Catherine Fougere of the French National Theatre.
Enchantée, monsieur.
Mr. Andreas Paskalis, who has made a specialty of servants' roles.
Thank you.
Why was I cast as the traitor?
We are all cast as the traitor for one simple reason:
We have all failed to love.
The comedy is over.
I can't stand any more.
I'm never going back.
- But you knew all about it.
- I thought I did.
You weren't the only one who was told not to get emotionally involved.
I'll never be able to make you believe me now.
Try.
Try harder.
- Julie?
- I'm frightened.
Frightened?
In case you do to me what you did to Anne.
Anne? To hell with Anne.
No.
- To hell with Nicholas.
- Julie!
There is no Julie.
What?
What the hell-
All gods.
Ancient gods.
If it hadn't been for you and your damn game, she'd still be alive.
I fear you are deceitful, Mr. Urfe.
Marriage is for mice,
Meli, not men.
Why did you cast me as the traitor?
You'll never see me again.
Never.
Never again.
To hell with Anne.
Rrodotis.
And this is the latest God.
Into it, we have fed all the known facts about you.
Now we shall proceed to instant analysis.
The subject is devoid of interest.
Except as a familiar type of male parasite.
His only law is his own pleasure.
His only morality is his own good.
He is a machine for self-gratification.
Not a human being.
I recommend that he be sterilised.
- Is there no hope for him?
- He is shallow.
He is vain.
He is egocentric.
He is a liar.
There is no hope for him.
Except as an actor, of course.
This is a trial, my friend...
but you are not the prisoner.
You are the judge.
And now... we come to the case against the accused.
You are not only the judge...
You are also the executioner.
- Yes or no? Yes or no?
- Anne, if you'd just listen.
- You can't decide these things!
- Yes or no?
This isn't my room.
You are in Athens.
You have been very ill.
But I think you have recovered.
Due to your expert treatment?
Due to your excellent cooperation.
Aw, come on.
How long is this game going on?
Are you so sure it's a game?
- Well, good-bye.
- Answer one question.
What you do...
Is it for us or for yourself... because of what you did in the war?
Just once... the truth.
What is truth?
Anne!
Anne.
Anne.
Anne!
Anne!
Anne!
"We shall not cease from exploration.
And the end of all our exploring"...
"Will be to arrive where we started...
And know the place for the first time".
"Mothra" (Mosura)
Typhoon number eight...
Just passing the Caroline Islands
...has developed into a more powerful storm.
Its center winds are calculated at 60 meters per second with gusts of 80 meters per second!
It's traveling at 50 km per hour on a northerly course towards the Japanese mainland!
Attention all stations! Attention all stations!
The 5400 ton vessel, Genyo-maru...
...is caught near the center of Typhoon number eight!
Please standby for distress signals!
Navigator, what is our present position?!
We are about four miles east of Infant Island!
What? Infant Island?!
- Are you sure?.
- Yes Sir.We're drifting hat way quickly.
Damn...
The typhoon will push us into the radiation!
Captain! Hold on!
We've hit a reef!
We're taking water!
Are you alright?
Abandon ship!
Right! Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
They went down around this radioactive area.
Hey, our fuel is getting low.
This is helicopter JH-20 calling.
We've just made our first pass, over.
There doesn't seem to be any survivors. We are returning to base.
Look?
They're humans!
Helicopter JH-20 calling from sector K in the test area, over.
We are flying over Infant Island and have discovered four survivors.
Hey! We're here! Hey!
Just a moment please!
Just a moment please!
You will be given a chance for an interview soon enough!
Will we get a chance for an interview?
Let us take some pictures! That isn't asking too much!
Wait!
Let us in!
Dr. Harada...
...we've just completed the tests.
We didn't find radiation on any of them.
According to my calculations, this is scientifically impossible.
None of you have had any physical problems recently?
Do you know what I'm saying? None of you have any pain or inflammation of the joints?
Yes, we're all fine.
Excuse me...
What is it?
The truth is...
...I am a little hungry. That's because they let us eat a lot on the ship.
Hey, hey!
I'm with the Nitto Newspaper.
Nitto Newspaper?
Photographers are not allowed in here.
I'll have to ask for your camera.
Ten-chan!
I'm Fukuda from the Nitto Newspaper.
Who are you? Don't you know the radiation...
But there's no emergency, that's what you said.
I'm right, aren't I?
I'm Fukuda, pleased to meet you.
Since he's here, we may as well let them stay.
He's our''snapping turtle''.
Snapping turtle?
Oh, sorry...
What she means is when I get a hold of a story for the newspaper, I never let go.
About these guys...
Well, it's big news when they manage to survive radioactive counts of three million.
You'd think they'd be dead, huh?
So, the first thing you want to know is how they survived a radioactive count of three million?
Yes. This time I would like to ask them myself...
...how they managed to stay healthy in that radioactive area.
I want to be sure I fully understand what happened.
How could all these men survive in an area so polluted by radiation?
That's it. It was the red juice they gave us.
Red juice?
What is that?
It's what the natives there gave us.
The natives...
Did you say natives?! On Infant Island?!
This will put us on top!
The headline will read, ''The Mysterious Natives of Infant Island''.
What? That seems a bit overdramatic.
Be quiet. Put in what the Rolisikan ambassador said.
The Rolisikan government assures you...
...that we've thoroughly investigated Infant Island for natives.
We're not sure where they were...
...at the exact time of the atomic blast.
Ambassador, are you going to send an expedition?
The Rolisikan government has no plans at this time.
I wonder if anyone is an authority on those islands?
Dr. Chuzo should be able to assist us.
Chuzo?
He's an anthropologist.
He led the Polynesian expedition several years ago.
Good. Let's set up an interview right away.
I've already contacted him and sent Misgi to get a photo of him.
That was stupid!
What does it look like?
It's terrible! -How is it?
What the heck is this?
That's a great shot!
He doesn't like being photographed.
What a problem...
I have a feeling this is really big!
Hey, Chuzo...
Why won't you tell us all about the expedition?
You are the leader of the group, right?
You can hear all about it from the Rolisikan government.
Take his photo when he looks up.
I understand, I understand...
We won't try to take your photo.
At least let us see your face.
I don't have to show you my face.
What is it?
What's going on?
Sorry about that.
Hey, Shinji! Shinji!
Yes!
I told you to keep your pets in your room!
I was looking all over for it!
Chiro! Come here, Chiro!
Chiro! Chiro!
Just a moment...
I'll go and get it, alright?
Don't hurt yourself!
I'm fine...
Did you find it?
What's the matter?
What is it?!
Here.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Let's discuss the island. You are going on the expedition?
I haven't heard of one yet.
I'm sure you'll hear from them.
Isn't it amusing?
This has got to be an incredible discovery for someone like you.
It should open a new field of study for you.
Well, it should be interesting.
All of the Polynesian islanders share...
...a basic language structure and culture.
Does that mean that they are similar to the people of Hawaii or Tahiti?
Legends say...
...that the Polynesian people were the descendants of the ancient continent of Atlantis.
Do you believe what I'm saying?
I only believe what I see through the camera.
Then believe only in what you see.
The sound of a shutter reminds me of the sound of a guillotine.
A guillotine? That's a good one!
Please be careful...
Just like a guillotine, you'll never know when you're hit with a photo.
Wasn't that Dr. Harada? He's the leader of the Japanese expedition.
Hey, Michi!
Out of the way please. Out of the way.
What? The reporters have been shut out from the expedition?
Who was it that made such a demand?!
I'm sure you're all curious as to why reporters won't be allowed on this expedition.
There's no particular reason why.
We just want the mission to be successful.
Then you're saying that the press would just get in the way?
No, no, no... You and I see things differently.
This mission is my responsibility.
I won't need the services of the press.
It's a good thing you're out here.
I don't think reporters were allowed in there!
Hey, who is this Nelson guy?
Oh, he's the leader of the expedition.
I know that, but who is he really?
I don't think he's a scientist.
Why doesn't he want reporters?
Does he have something to hide?
Don't you think so?
I do.
Then he is suspicious.
He's suspicious.
Hey, is that what you think?
Then what do we do about it?
You must be joking!
Good luck!
Good luck!
Ten-chan!
Ten-chan!
Oh, Dr. Harada...
Is your meeting over already?
It's a good thing that you're taking it easy.
What was the meeting about?
Nelson is not a friendly man.
Nelson told me that he wants to see the expedition's data before it's released.
That's crazy!
He doesn't have any scientific background and he wants to have the reports?
I wonder what kind of business he's in?
Come out!
What are you doing here?
I'm just cleaning.
You were using that to clean?
I found it.
What is it anyway?
A Nitto Newspaper reporter doesn't make a good cabin boy.
I thought I was good.
Oh, well...
Just a moment.
You don't think I'm just going to let you walk out of here?
What are you doing here?
What is the meaning of this?
I just wanted to ask...
...if my research has to be passed on to you as well?
Of course.
Then, it's an order from the Rolisikan government?
It's my requirement for this expedition.
Then I'm ignoring it!
Let's go.
We will be approaching the site of the expedition in a short while.
You should you now put on your safety gear to shield you from the radiation.
Dr. Harada, how was it? Did you talk to Nelson?
I convinced Nelson to let him come with us...
...as long as he agreed not to do any reporting.
You could say I'm your cabin boy. Excuse me.
I'm Fukuda, with Nitto. Here...
Thanks.
Here...
Dr. Harada...
Why hasn't anyone decided to stand up against Nelson's control?
Even Dr. Roth reports to him, huh?
Is that what you say? Then, if Dr. Roth...
I'm a cabin boy. Sorry...
It is now time for us to go ashore.
I hope each and every one of you does your best...
...to make this expedition a great success.
Now, if any of you encounter any problems...
...the button on your right shoulder is a silent alarm transmitter.
Do not use it unless you are in urgent need of assistance, and we'll go to your location.
Please be patient in your research. Dismissed.
Chuzo!
What do you think you're doing?!
I'm lost.
What?
I am lost!
I have been looking for Chuzo.
What in the world did I step into?
This isn't normal growth.
They all look like fungus.
That's it, they're all giant fungus.
The survivors must have drank their juice...
...in order to stay alive.
I'm not sure which direction we should go from here.
It's amazing...
Doctor! I can't seem to find Chuzo.
That way!
Chuzo! What's wrong?
Chuzo! Chuzo!
Chuzo!
Hang in there!
Chuzo!
Chuzo!
Chuzo... Chuzo...
Hello.
Don't say that! What happened?
A blood-sucking plant attacked me.
That's it...
And then I was saved by two small women.
Small people? You're sure you didn't see children?
No.
I thought they were about 30 centimeters tall.
I could swear they were girls no larger than dolls!
What? Doll women?
You sure that you didn't imagine this?
No! They were real!
Well, we can't go back tonight.
We'll have to go back first thing in the morning.
Hey, how did these beauties come by to help you?
Beauties?
Oh, it's a journalist term.
You had a vision of two young ladies.
We like to call them beauties.
I got it!
Huh? What is it?
That's it!
Well, good night.
How's that for gratitude?
How can I interview you this way?
Jeez, I must be slipping.
What's the matter?
Chuzo!
-What's happening?
I think this has gone too far.
I'm not playing games.
I was wondering how they found me last night...
...when I figured that they were attracted to the sound of my alarm.
A song! They're communicating by song!
No, that's not a song.
It's their way of speech.
I'm not sure how they're doing it...
...but it's an unusual form of language.
Can you understand what they're saying right now?
It sounds like they want us to leave their island alone.
Oh, of course!
They want us to take our atomic tests somewhere else!
There will definitely not be any more nuclear tests.
You're very rude!
What do you think you're doing?!
I know movie producers who would want these girls.
Release those two girls this instant!
Doctor!
Nelson...
Natives!
They're coming!
They're over here too! Retreat! Retreat!
Release them now.
I have what we came here for!
Well, don't expect us to fight for you. Sentries put down your weapons.
Put down your weapons!
Boss, what do we do?
Are you sure?
Give them to me.
Let's get back to the ship!
Return to the ship! -Fall in!
Hey, doctor...
I wasn't sure what to think at first...
...but I think we're lucky to come to this island.
The ship has finally docked.
The investigative team...
...led by Nelson, the meteorologist, traveled to study the mysteries of life.
What amazing stories will they have to report?
A special event? It wasn't just a special event.
They went to an island hit with three million counts of radiation!
What happened to Fukuda? I want you to find him!
Ten-chan!
Welcome back!
Welcome back. Thank you for going there.
Is this what happened to you all this time?
I was very worried about you! The desk editor is furious!
Come on.
Was this your only trip to the island?
Why didn't we receive more reports?
Hey, wait a minute!
You can't leave without telling us anything!
Clark Nelson.
Date of birth and birthplace, unknown. Pre-war history is unknown.
In 1954, he traveled to the Amazon in search of a native tribe there.
Although the mission was a failure, he was praised for a job well done.
I'm thinking...
...doesn't he seem like an international art broker to you?
An art broker?
Sure... The type who seeks out ancient art and steals it to sell.
It's a profitable business!
Doesn't that seem like a far-fetched idea?
Right. But this guy...
Guess what map I found when I was caught in his room?
Infant Island.
Fukuda, I found something strange on the island.
Fukuda, here it is.
What is it?
What is this?
I found this on a rock beyond a cave I discovered on Infant Island.
A cave? Did you say you found a cave?
It was an unusual cave.
I would have told Dr. Harada about it...
...but Nelson was always around.
The same symbol is all over this thing.
I think the message is a reference to it.
Through the use of my manuals on all of the Polynesian dialects...
...I think I know what it is.
Then what does the symbol mean?
Mothra.
Huh? Mothra?
What could that mean?
I don't know.
You're both very cute girls. I'm glad that I could see you again.
Boss! The natives!
Fire! Fire and then retreat!
Mothra...
Mothra...
Mothra...
How long have you been our''snapping turtle''?
Five years, three months.
What?!
And you saw these girls on Infant Island?
Don't say that! Why didn't you file the story?!
Well?
Well, we didn't want them to get hurt.
Damn! That's your problem to deal with!
The scientists are human.
What?
The entire expedition group agreed to it...
...but we didn't expect this guy to put them into showbiz!
These girls are human!
We didn't want them to get hurt!
I'm a human, too!
Welcome, everyone.
We are living in the atomic age.
But people, does that mean there are no mysteries of life?
Have all of its wonders become obsolete?
No! Life is not without its mysteries! -Let's go up front.
This mystery is not a dream.
Tonight you will see the original life, the original mystery...
It is what I've discovered in my journey to the South Pacific.
I hope you enjoy the two lovely fairies.
Did you come alone?
No, my father is somewhere in the back.
I spoke with Dr. Roth earlier today.
It seems the Rolisikan government wasn't too enthusiastic about our expedition.
Oh, they were having financial difficulties, huh?
All of the financing was provided by Nelson.
So, he was your sponsor?
No wonder why he wanted to come along.
That melody...
Well, stop your meddling. Please go home.
I'm not meddling. I want an interview!
Well, that's enough for me.
I don't want you to know anything more about my mysterious ladies.
Hey!
What are you doing? No! No!
I'm not leaving! -You're going now!
What's going on?
Ten-chan!
Nelson!
It's been a while, huh?
I need to talk to you.
Talk?
Stop this inhumane show.
Return the girls to their island.
Inhumane...? You're crazy!
We make sure they get the best of everything!
These two mysterious girls aren’t just human beings, they're genuine treasures.
What are you saying?
My paper will tell all about what you're doing here!
You do and we'll sue you for slander!
Then why don't you tell me how much this fiend...
...profits from using these girls like slaves!
Slaves...? Don't be ridiculous! Do you think we use them like that?
My mysterious girls wouldn't sing if they weren't happy.
Then where are the girls?
Well, I don't know if this is right, but I'll let you see them for just 3 minutes!
If you're wondering if the girls are happy, you can see for yourself.
Miss, the camera, please.
I have all the advertising I need.
You're so rude! You can have it!
Please don't be worried.
Oh, they're pretty!
Do you understand me?
I'm the one you saved from the blood-sucking plant.
Hey, they look so frightened and scared.
Why don't we try to free them?
No.
We don't want Nelson to realize what we plan to do just yet.
But I don't like that guy.
We all feel the same way about that!
Hey, I hope you're doing well.
We don't think anyone in the world has the right to hold you like this.
Thank you.
The two of us do not wish to be here.
You finally understand what we're saying?
We do not have a use for words.
We understand through feelings and ideas.
Telepathy, huh?
Telepathy, right!
We truly want to return home as soon as possible...
But...
But, what?
She will come to rescue us...
...regardless of what happens to your country...
...and that fills us with great sadness.
Great sadness?
What's happening?
Mothra is coming.
Mothra?
Mothra is coming here...
...to rescue us.
Mothra...
...open your eyes. Mothra...
...your people are in need of you.
We need you to awaken for us now.
Look at this story! I want a retraction!
Anyway, you're paper had no right printing this story.
It is my newspaper's responsibility to report the truth.
Alright, you won't retract it for me, huh?
I'm going to the Rolisikan ambassador.
Your company will have big problems then.
Editor, this just came over the ticker-tape machine.
A large object...
...unidentified, floating in the South Pacific.
What does it mean?
Mothra is coming.
Mothra.
What the hell is a Mothra?
Infant Island has a legend, about a huge protector!
It's coming to rescue the girls!
That's just a load of garbage to sell newspapers.
I heard it directly from the girls!
What?
He's not lying.
Mothra is coming to rescue the two girls.
Everyone, what you are hearing, is one of the great wonders of life.
The only way to enjoy this spectacle is to hear it for yourself.
Hard to port! -Hard to port!
Shut up! All of you just shut up!
You want us to shut up?!
I'm not the one responsible for destroying the Orion!
This has no relation to me.
That's how it is.
We have nothing to do with an attack that was caused by a monster.
Is that so?
If you weren't holding onto the girls, Mothra wouldn't be coming here!
Coming to Japan! To Tokyo!
Think of the destruction!
Stop spreading lies! Your opinion is wrong.
Nelson!
Be quiet!
Regardless of what you say, it's pointless.
If you push this any further, we'll report you to the Rolisikan embassy.
You don't want to be indicted by them, do you?
Indicted?
Fine by me! Arrest us if you can!
Chuzo, it seems hopeless.
I hate to say it, but it looks bad for those two.
But, if we saw them once more...
Once more?
Let's go talk to the girls.
What is it?
We want to talk to the girls.
You can't!
No one goes in without the boss' approval!
I understand.
You think I'm joking?! You...!
Stop it.
Stop it!
I wish you would just cooperate!
What's going on here?! Damn you!
This can't be helped. I'll take care of these guys.
Hurry... Go talk to the girls.
Thank you.
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go, I said!
You're dealing with the Snapping Turtle! I'm not just a simple fast-talker!
Is there no way that you two can prevent this from happening?
Don't you have a way that you can control Mothra's strength?
Mothra has no way to understand.
Mothra is coming to us through her own instincts.
Really?
There's really no way you can control her?
We're very sorry...
...but there's nothing we can do.
That's it! Once more!
It's telepathy!
Can telepathy be stopped?
Can you do it?
We're testing something now that might be able to help us.
This material was designed with the hope...
...that it could prevent radio waves from affecting the oscilloscope.
I see...
If we could put them in a box made of this, Mothra may not know where to find them.
I've found it! It's about a hundred meters long!
Position? Okay, 137 degrees, 2 minutes north. 23 degrees, 10 minutes east.
Its current speed is 11 knots, heading for Tokyo!
Scramble our first air squadron.
We're right on top!
What? The lawsuit against us?
Oh, that's just a distraction.
Well, we'll be there to cover the Mothra battle.
Alright.
Well, I feel sorry for Mothra.
What?
It's all Nelsom's fault! If he would just release...
Damn!
What's the matter?
The Rolisikan government is supporting Nelson!
What?
The Rolisikan government states that it is obliged...
...to protect the rights of its citizens abroad.
Head to the defense office. Find out their plans!
Target sighted. Open bomb bays!
Bombs away!
Bombs away!
Everything you've tried was useless.
Are you certain that Mothra is really dead?
Of course, but I'm not worried about that.
I'm not so sure that she is gone...
...so take the box with you as a simple precaution.
Yes, yes... In case I'm wrong.
It's certainly not for your sake!
Hey!
Excuse me. We're only interested...
...in protecting others from your selfishness.
That's why we're giving you this box to stop them using their telepathy.
It's to prevent any misunderstanding.
I'm here!
Thanks for coming.
I am very lucky!
You're kidding.
What? Between god, prayers and my friends...
...I'm not chivalrous enough to go against Mothra for this pay!
Well, you're not alone there.
Is that an earthquake?
It doesn't feel like one.
Thank you, thank you.
Well, I don't think that I'll need it, but I'll use the box as you suggest.
How about it? The show is about to start.
No.
Oh, you won't need any money.
You can all be guests on my behalf.
Mr. Nelson, it's the phone for you.
Just a moment, please.
Hello? This is Nelson.
Huh? What? Cancel it?!
The Japanese Police are cruel!
Why should I cancel it?
Then go ahead and get it!
How rude!
Ten-chan!
You don't know what happened!
I know, I know... Nelson was called to cancel the show.
You're wrong! Something happened at Dam number three!
The dam?
Incredible...
Mothra!
It may destroy it! Let's hurry!
Let's go!
What's that?!
It's breaking! Run! Run away!
Stop it!
Alright!
I don't know how, but your pet is not taking you back to your island!
Be quiet!
I won't tell you any more!
In the case.
Get away!
Halt! Halt! Halt! Halt!
Halt! Halt! Halt!
Stop! Stop!
Doctor, it has to be Mothra! -Here, hold this for me.
How did she get here?
You can't do this! You must leave the bridge!
It's no good! Leave! Leave!
Hurry! Hurry!
Look out! Hurry! Hurry!
Ten-chan!
Mothra is angry because...
...Nelson is holding the two small girls against their will.
For their sake, I am taking them from him.
I hate Nelson.
Where could he have gone?
What's the matter?
A kid managed to get in the building.
He was wearing a red cap.
That kid could be a problem.
Damn that Mothra!
Anyway, we have to get rid of that kid for our own sake. Hurry!
I'm going to let you go.
Thank you...
...but Mothra is coming for us.
You should hurry and get away!
I'll be alright! When I get you home...
...my brother will return you to your island.
You bastard! How could you let him get away?!
Idiots! What's going on here?!
Well, a kid broke into the building and...
Go find that kid! Find him now!
There he is!
Hey! -Wait!
Hey, you! Wait! -Get back here!
Did you find him?
We can't find him anywhere!
Damn! Where did he go?!
Boss! Here he is!
Idiot!
Editor! The Rolisikan government is backing down!
The Rolisikan government is afraid of losing its ties to Japan...
...and is ordering Nelson to release the girls!
Alright! You're the top!
I'm going over to the theater! I want to see the look on Nelson's face!
It's terrible!
I know, I know! Wait for me here!
Hey!
Chuzo! What brings you here?
What's going on?
Nelson's about to be spooked!
My little brother said he was coming here to free the two girls.
Huh...? Hold this!
Fukuda! This is Shinji's!
You don't suppose...
Shinji!
Shinji! Shinji!
Hey! -Shinji!
Shinji!
Shinji! Shinji!
Brother!
You're safe now.
Are you okay?
Brother, I let you down!
It's alright!
Don't worry, Nelson will get what's coming to him.
Hey, it's terrible!
I know. Nelson, right?
What are you saying?! Mothra's on her way here!
What did you say?
Mothra? Where?!
She's making her way toward Tokyo!
Mothra's passed Mount Fuji and is heading for the city where Unit 2 is waiting. Roger.
Yes, Unit 2 is ready. Waiting for orders.
Unit 3 is moving into position within the city.
With Mothra approaching...
...residents of the Shibuya ward are asked to evacuate to the emergency shelters.
All residents of Shibuya...
...please evacuate your homes and make your way to the emergency shelters.
Fall back! Fall back!
Boss, this way is no good!
Perhaps it would be better if we went toward the sea?
Turn around. I have an idea.
...Ameike, Akasaikami. Those areas have just been evacuated. Let's try to stop it there.
It's currently at Goma 2-1. Mothra is making its way toward Tokyo Tower.
All of the local population there has been evacuated.
Ready to fire!
Ready to fire!
Wait for the commander's orders!
Yes, sir. Our unit is ready to attack. Roger.
Stand by!
What's that?
Base, base! Mothra is building a cocoon!
Mothra will grow in the cocoon until it's ready to leave.
That's probably how they'll return to Infant Island.
General, has Nelson been found?
He was last seen at the theater, but no one has seen him since then.
Boss...
You're George Walker, with the Rolisikan ambassador.
Alright?
Excuse me.
Editor!
I'm not paying you to sightsee!
How about Mothra making a cocoon?
What about Nelson?
I haven't found where he is.
Do I have to play ''G-Man'' for you, too?
This Mothra in front of us isn't a story!
Your behavior is disgraceful!
There hasn't been any sighting of Nelson up to now!
The first thing Nelson would do...
...is to get on jet bound for Rolisika either tonight or tomorrow.
How would that be possible?
I'm sure he could pull a few strings.
He'll do anything to keep the girls away from Mothra.
Let's go to Hanada Airport!
Excuse me.
The military command of the Rolisikan government...
...is willing to loan you its best offensive weapon.
These atomic heat cannons...
...will they be here in time to assist us?
Please relax. They will be here within ten hours.
With Mothra cocooned on Tokyo Tower...
...the army intends to surround the creature while it's dormant.
They hope to launch an attack while it is asleep...
...to end this confrontation without a large assault.
The Japanese and Rolisikan governments hope the atomic heat cannons will do the job.
In front of us, Mothra is not moving. The attack will begin shortly.
Hey!
Incredible...
We will begin our attack at 10:00.
Your attention please! Your attention please!
The military will begin its attack at 10:00!
When the atomic cannons begin firing...
...it is recommended that you wear your protective glasses!
Attacking in sixty seconds!
Ten-chan, your glasses.
Thirty seconds!
Twenty seconds!
Ten seconds... 9... 8... 7...
There is no doubt everyone, that the cocoon was...
Boss, with no one to follow us, we should be alright.
You're right. We're not in Japan anymore.
This is my home in Rolisika.
Mothra would never figure out that we would hide on a farm.
It appears that the monster...
...known as Mothra has been defeated.
A military commander is heading towards a microphone.
Everyone... everyone in the entire world, please wait.
Mothra has been confirmed dead!
Boss, boss! We're safe now, huh?
Well, sing! Keep singing!
You'll sing a long time before Mothra shows up!
Chuzo!
Look! Mothra seems to be heading for Rolisika.
Right, doctor?
Well, Nelson won't be safe in Rolisika.
Rolisikan patrol jets are in the sky searching for Mothra.
On that matter, public opinion of the Rolisikan people...
...have turned against Nelson as this continues.
The Rolisikan police have been instructed to arrest Nelson on sight, and they are actively...
Boss, this won't work!
If we go out there, we'll be picked up for sure!
Hey, I have something important to tell you.
What are you doing here?
I've been asked to help the Rolisikan government.
Don't tell me...
...that they want our help in trying to speak to Mothra?
You're right.
I'm right?!
Sure... What could we possibly say to it?
No, our problem is the girls.
We're the only ones that they've spoken to that they seem to trust.
I see...
But where do we find the girls?
First of all, we find Nelson...
...and they'll be happy to return to Infant Island.
Your attention please.
We've just learned...
...that Mothra has been sighted in the Newkirk City area.
Boss, I don't like this plan.
Chuzo, what do we do now?
Should we open it here?
No!
How would Mothra react if she knew they were here?
We shouldn't put these people through that!
Newkirk City is in bad shape.
Chuzo...
Do you remember this?
Oh, the symbol on Infant Island?
That's right. Look up there!
I get it!
That symbol must have some special significance with Mothra.
Right.
Hey, those bells... They remind me of the girls songs.
Chuzo, is there any way...
...that we can use this mark and the sound of the bells?
Mothra and the sound of prayers...
And songs...
Alright, let's do it.
We need you to have this symbol drawn as large as possible on the airport runway.
This?
Yes. We need it as soon as possible.
We'll do it.
And then, can you get the church bells of every town to ring at 3:00?
You want them to ring at 3:00?
Yes.
Okay, I'll see what I can do.
Do you think it will work?
Well, I don't doubt the power of prayer.
It's not so mysterious, but it's all up to god, now.
Well, we better get going.
It's 3:00.
I'm not sure... But it seems to be quiet.
It's coming this way!
Is it okay?
Alright. It's landing.
Thank you, everyone.
We pray that our land and yours will live in peace and harmony.
Thank you.
We promise not to disturb the peace of Infant Island.
Thank you.
Mothra is waiting for us. Goodbye!
Take care.
I'm not sure if we'll have peace and harmony, but we'll do fine.
Goodbye.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
That's it!
I've got to call the editor! It's a top story!
Oh, no! -Huh?
I didn't get a picture!
It's alright!
The path of peace...
...is yours to discover for eternity.
Once upon a midnight dreary...
while I pondered, weak and weary...
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore...
while I nodded, nearly napping...
suddenly there came a tapping...
as of someone gently rapping...
rapping at my chamber door.
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered...
"Tapping at my chamber door...
"only this, and nothing more."
Distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December...
and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow...
vainly I had sought to borrow...
from my books surcease of sorrow...
sorrow for the lost Lenore...
for the rare and radiant maiden...
whom the angels name Lenore.
Nameless here forevermore.
And the silken sad uncertain rustling...
of each purple curtain thrilled me...
filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before.
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating...
"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door.
"Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door.
"This it is...
"and nothing more."
Lenore.
Come back to me, Lenore.
Come back to me.
I brought you your goblet of warm milk, father.
Yes, thank you, my dear.
She's been dead for over two years now, father.
You're young, Estelle.
The young do not understand grief.
To you she was only a stepmother, but to me, she was...
My life.
I'm sorry.
- Good night.
- Good night, my dear.
Come in.
Enter!
Well, upon my soul.
Do you want to come in?
I believe it does.
Well then, come on.
Who sent you to me?
Are you some dark, winged messenger from beyond?
Answer me, monster. Tell me truly... shall I ever hold again that radiant maiden... whom the angels call Lenore?
How the hell should I know?
What am I, a fortune-teller?
Oooo, I'm chilled to the bones.
Why don't you give me some wine?
Well, don't just stand there gaping at me.
That voice, I...
Will you give me some wine?
Yes. Yes!
Here's some nice hot milk.
Milk! How vomitable.
Surely this is a dream.
Hurry up, will you?
There you are.
What do you expect me to do... hold it?
With what?
Oh, never mind.
I like that.
Upon my soul.
Never mind your soul.
Start concentrating on getting me back to my rightful form.
Your rightful form?
Well what do you think?
I was born this way?
Well I... I have it.
You are under an enchantment.
Took you long enough to find that out.
Let's get to work.
Well go ahead. Do something.
But what?
Restore me to my rightful form.
I just don't know how.
Oh no... Well...
You got some dried blood of a bat in the house?
I beg your pardon.
Bat's blood.
Dried or evaporated bat's blood.
No.
How about some chain links from a gallows bird?
Jellied spiders? Rabbits' lard?
Dead-man's hair?
No. We don't keep those things in this house.
We're vegetarians.
And that calls himself a magician.
Honestly, this is too much.
- Just a moment.
- Yes?
Perhaps there are some of those staples... down in my father's old laboratory.
Well don't you know?
No. I haven't been down there... since he died, over twenty years ago.
Well, let's go and see.
I don't care to remain like this... for the rest of my life.
Oh, these feathers itch!
Do you mean to say that these things you requested... are going to turn you back into...
- What were you?
- Never mind.
Come on. Let's go.
Strange to be down here again, after all these years.
- How much further is it?
- Just a little way.
Now what is it you need?
Dried bat's blood.
Chain links from a gallows bird.
Rabbits' lard. Essence of...
Slowly, slowly.
One thing at a time, please.
Now what is it?
Nothing.
What's that?
Entrails of troubled horse.
No, no, put it back.
- What's that?
- I can't read it.
Well, look inside then.
What is it?
I'd rather not discuss it, if you don't mind.
You did say dead-man's hair?
Yes. That's one of the prime ingredients.
All right, let's get on with it.
All right, all right, that's enough stirring.
Now the tongue of a vulture.
Come on, come on.
You're the slowest magician I've ever seen.
It's a very difficult recipe.
Is that all there is of it?
You've got the jellied spiders in there?
Yes.
The eye of a white weasel?
Yes.
You didn't forget the dead-man's hair?
No.
Well that should do it, then.
Hand it over.
You're not going to drink it?
What did you think I was going to do?
Take a bath in it?
That's not so bad.
Dr. Craven?
Dr. Raven...
Dr. Bedlo.
Bedlo?
Don't you remember me? We met... at a sorcerer's convention lunch several years ago.
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Well, in any case, everything seems to have gone all right.
Yes.
Look! Look what you did to me.
Look what you did to me...
What I did to you?
Who else?
You made the potion, didn't you?
Yes, but it was your recipe.
My recipe was right.
There just wasn't enough of it.
Then all I can do is to make some more of it.
Well then go make some more!
All right. All right.
Let me see, now.
Jellied spiders... yes.
Here we are.
Evaporated bat's blood.
Or do you prefer dehydrated?
- I don't care.
- OK.
What a night. What a night!
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
- What is it now?
- Dead-man's hair.
- What about it?
- We're out of it.
- Well go get some more then.
- More? Where?
- Where?
In a graveyard. Where else?
Enter a graveyard at this time of night?
Despoil the dead?
No, you would rather see me go through life like this, would you?
No, of course not.
Oh, I am sorry.
Let's go to the graveyard.
That won't be necessary, you see... my father is in the family crypt... and I don't think papa would mind... if I took just a snip or two... in a good cause.
Why should he mind?
Yes, you're right.
Let's be on our way.
How did you... come to find yourself in this awkward state?
It's a little embarrassing, but...
You've heard of
Dr. Scarabus, of course?
Scarabus? Heaven help us.
Was he the one who did this to you?
Who else?
How did it come about?
I invited myself to his castle for dinner.
Of course, as a member of the brotherhood... of magicians and sorcerers... and Scarabus is the grand master.
You have heard of the brotherhood?
Oh yes.
Yes.
My father was its grand master for twenty-seven years... with Scarabus a rival for his power... every moment of the time.
I didn't know that.
Yes. It's precisely because... of the painful memories of those years that... well, that I never saw fit to join the brotherhood.
Tell me, if your father was grand master... then by direct line of ascension... you could claim the mastership for yourself.
Oh, no. Heaven forbid, no.
No, I prefer to practice my magic quietly at home.
But you were telling me how it happened.
Oh, it was the result of too much wine.
I became abusive and... then I became critical of his abilities.
Yes?
And then I challenged him to a duel.
Of magic?
Well, the whole thing was completely unfair.
I was just getting my magical equipment ready, and then... all he did was a few gestures in the air with his hands.
You mean, he... only used his hands?
Yes. What of it?
Then his skill is far greater than I ever had dreamed of.
Far greater? He was cheating.
Oh no. No, Dr. Bedlo.
Magic by gesture of the hands is the most advanced sorcery.
I don't agree with you at all.
I can't agree.
If I would have been sober... which I admit doesn't happen very often, but... it would have been an entirely different story... entirely different.
And I'll get my revenge on him yet. You'll see.
With all my heart, sir, I tell you... do not go back there.
Hard place to keep clean, huh?
Yes. I very seldom get down here.
Thank you.
Ouch!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Forgive me, papa.
Beware.
What did he say?
He... He told me to... to beware.
- Of what?
- I don't know.
I suggest we'd better leave here.
Yes.
Don't forget my hair.
Come on, hurry up!
Come on.
Beware!
A little unexpected, what happened down there.
Yes, it was most unexpected.
I just don't understand.
Why should my father return from the dead... and then tell me to beware? Of what?
I wish I knew.
I-I-I wish I knew.
Yes.
That milk.
Oh, I am sorry.
In any case, I have to return... to the castle of
Dr. Scarabus tonight.
No. Sir, please, I beg you.
I implore you.
Do not go back there.
But he has confiscated all my magical equipment.
- And I want revenge.
- But he is too powerful.
Then come with me.
No. No, I want nothing to do with him... nothing at all.
No?
What's the picture of that woman doing here?
That woman?
That woman, sir, was my wife.
- Left you, huh?
- Certainly not.
Then what was she doing with Dr. Scarabus?
What?
But that's impossible, sir.
She's been dead for over two years.
- I saw her there.
- When?
- This evening.
- No.
Oh, no.
I keep her here.
Where else? May I?
Thank you.
But I'd...
I'd swear I saw her there this evening.
No.
No, you saw someone else.
It was her.
No. That's not possible.
Unless...
Unless what?
Unless Scarabus has gained control of her spirit.
But why?
To take his revenge on the house of Craven.
No. This profanation must be ended.
Then you're coming with me?
Yes, I must go with you... for the sake of Lenore's tormented soul.
And don't forget my magical equipment.
No.
- You rang, sir?
- Yes, Grimes.
Prepare the coach for immediate departure.
Yes, sir.
And you're going to need something... to protect you from the cold.
No, I meant clothes!
Oh...
In here.
I think this one will...
No, I despise black lately.
Oh, yes. Sorry.
What about this red one here?
Well it's a little gaudy, but...
I like that.
That's beautiful. Thank you.
It's a little long, isn't it?
Yes. I'm sorry.
Here, let's try this.
Yes, that's nice. Thank you.
The sleeves are a little long, but...
Yes, but I can hold them.
It'll keep you warm.
- That's nice. I like that.
- There you are.
You really should wear a hat.
Thank you.
That's very considerate of you.
But I can't see through that.
That's meant to be a scarf, doctor, you see? There.
But I don't want to be...
I don't want to be choked to death by a head...
I'm sorry. Here, try this one.
I don't like the material.
Well, then this?
That's nice. That matches this green, doesn't it?
A little too large, isn't it?
Yes. Here, try this one.
Really, anything will do.
That's fine.
Father?
Yes, my dear.
You're going out at this hour?
Yes, I am, my dear. Doctor.
Dr. Bedlo, this is my daughter, Estelle.
Dr. Bedlo.
Enchante, m'selle.
- Where are you going, father?
- Well, I can't tell you, Estelle.
It's something dangerous, isn't it?
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Shall we go, doctor?
- I'm going with you.
- No, you most certainly are not.
- But, father...
- Don't worry, my dear.
Nothing too bad is going to happen.
Just trust me.
Doctor!
Father!
Father!
Father!
Father, wake up!
Don't leave us!
It's every man for himself!
Erasmus, wake up.
- Why aren't you doing something?
- Why don't you do something?
Without my equipment...
- Are you all right, my dear?
- Father.
Tell me, how did you do that?
That? Oh, it was nothing worthy of note.
What do you mean, nothing worthy?
It was the most spectacular thing I've ever seen.
Thank you.
No, Dr. Bedlo.
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened, you... you maniac! You idiot!
What did happen, Grimes?
I was on my way to the stable.
How did I get in here?
You don't remember coming in here?
Last thing I remember was something burning at my head.
- Burning?
- Burning.
Never mind, Grimes.
It's not important.
You go and prepare the carriage.
What do you mean, it's not important?
He almost killed us.
- That will be all, Grimes.
- Yes, sir.
You're letting him go?
But can't you see? He has no idea of what happened.
Clearly, he was the victim of some diabolic mind control.
That's nonsense.
- Scarabus?
- Scarabus?
Yes, my dear.
Yes, it is to his castle that I must go.
I am going with you, then.
But she can't help us.
But what other choice do I have?
What if Scarabus should attack again?
Well I... I better get something, too... because I don't want to catch a cold.
Hold this for me.
This is my son Rexford.
This is Dr. Craven... and that's his daughter...
What's her name?
- Estelle.
- Mademoiselle Estelle.
Enchante, ma chere.
Doesn't he speak beautiful French?
- Yes.
- Now get out of here.
But, father, I've been looking for you.
That's all right, but leave now because we are in a hurry.
- What about mother?
- What about her?
- She wants you home.
- Why?
I don't know, but she gave me strict instructions... that once I found you, not to let you out of my sight.
Don't do that, Rexford.
Dr. Bedlo, we must be on our way now.
Yes, we are in a hurry.
If you do that once more...
I'll smash you one right in the face!
- Dr. Bedlo, please.
- He's my son!
Yes, I know, but we must go.
- Then I must go with you.
- Yes, certainly. Certainly.
Maybe you want to bring your friends with you?
Maybe you want to have a family outing, huh?
Bring your own mother.
I'm sure Dr. Scarabus... would be delighted to have your mother.
- Dr. Scarabus?
- Yes, that's where we're going.
You are not going to let him drive.
I don't like to, but if he doesn't, who will?
I'd be glad to drive, sir.
That's very nice of you, young man.
- Grimes, you can stay here.
- Yes, sir.
Estelle?
Father, mayn't I ride up there?
You know how ill it makes me to sit inside.
Yes, yes, of course.
Good-bye, sir.
That's a fine boy you have.
Does he favor his mother?
She favors him.
Thank you.
"I'd be glad to drive, sir."
Idiot!
What was that about your coachman before?
Oh, when he went out to the stable to prepare the coach... something happened to him.
Father said that he was obviously the victim... of some diabolical mind control.
Whatever it was, the look on his face was hideous... his eyes glittering like those of a maniac... his lips drawn back, and his teeth clenched tight... his breath harsh and rapid.
Don't you think we'd better go a little slower?
Father!
Now what is this idiot doing?
What's the matter with you?
I'm talking to you, Rexford!
Help!
He looks as crazy as your coachman did.
What?
Why don't you do something?
Some magic or something?
And leave the coach without a driver?
Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Are you all right?
There it is.
What?
Shouldn't we better go in there alone?
To what avail, sir?
Obviously Scarabus' powers of magic... are not confined within the walls of his castle.
That's right.
Why don't you go in?
R-R-Rexford, you go ahead.
There's no one here.
Hey!
You do something!
Let's get out of here.
No.
No, we haven't come this far to... retreat at the first obstacle.
Dr. Scarabus?
Dr. Scarabus?
A cozy little place, huh?
I'm afraid. Father, I...
Afraid, my dear?
There's nothing to be afraid of.
I bid you welcome, one and all.
You are Dr. Craven, are you not?
How happy I am to meet you after all these years.
The son of Roderick Craven in my home at last.
Your father and I were great friends, you know.
Friends?
But who is this delightful creature?
Well, she...
No, no, no. Tell me nothing.
Of course, I can see the lineage is clear.
She is your daughter
Estelle, is she not?
Yes.
Thrice welcome to the home of Dr. Scarabus, my child.
How enchanting you are.
And this fine young fellow... surely not your son, dear doctor?
I am Dr. Bedlo's son.
I am sorry.
Yes, the resemblance is quite uncanny.
But what happy circumstance brings you to my home... dear doctor?
The spirit of my late wife.
The spirit, sir? Late wife?
I'm afraid I do not understand you.
Dr. Bedlo has informed me that...
Very discreetly.
That he saw my wife Lenore within these walls.
Is it true, sir?
Have you her soul in bondage?
Dr. Craven, I am shocked... truly shocked that you should harbor... such an appalling thought about me.
You've wounded me to the heart.
But if it is not true... then why did you try to prevent our arrival?
I did not try to prevent your arrival.
But, sir, we thought...
What are you doing?
Summoning forth the truth.
Lenore.
Lenore!
You rang, sir?
That's not my...
There is your spirit, sir.
You may go.
My apologies, Dr. Scarabus, for having wronged you.
How can I express my sorrow at this gross misunderstanding?
But please, sir, join me at the table.
A little food and wine and conversation.
Let us not part on such a somber note.
You will make this kindly gesture... for an old man's sake?
Yes, yes. Of course.
My gratitude knows no bounds.
Dr. Bedlo, young sir.
On my right, Dr. Craven, if you will.
Your lovely daughter next to you.
Dr. Bedlo, on my left, if you please.
All right.
But don't think I have forgotten... what happened earlier this evening.
But, sir, I hoped you had forgotten.
That you turned me into a raven?
A raven?
But, sir, you tried to kill me.
So what?
Well, under the circumstances...
I feel I behaved with great leniency.
I knew that presently... you would find some way to restore yourself... and, lo, you have, and all is well again.
And you didn't try to stop us from coming here?
Have I not yet convinced you of my sincerity?
Come. Eat, drink.
Let me enjoy one full hour of fine conviviality... with the son of my old friend.
I'm sorry, sir... but my father never gave me the impression... that you and he were anything but mortal enemies.
Oh, doctor. Competitors, yes.
Contestants if you like, but enemies? No.
I admired him more than any other man.
Oh I... I see.
And yet, it...
It always appeared that...
Appeared, dear doctor.
You and I of the occult dedication... know only too well the deceptiveness... of what appears to be.
Yes, that is true.
That is quite true.
But tell me now, tell me something... of your miraculous hand manipulations... of which I've heard such wondrous accounts... and yet have never witnessed.
But I have already seen that you, too... possess the gift of magic by gesture.
I have my humble means.
Humble?
Humble he calls it... turning people into birds.
Are you still talking about that?
The incident is closed.
It is not!
Where is my bag of magical equipment?
- In a safe place.
- Give it back to me.
Gladly, doctor... if you will but give me your promise not to...
I promise nothing! I challenge you!
Again?
Dr. Bedlo.
Shut your mouth!
I know you.
You're afraid to face me when I'm sober, huh?
Are you sober?
Sober enough to make a fool of you, you cheap faker, you.
Father.
Dr. Bedlo.
That I did not hear.
We will proceed with our present conversation.
Yes, you are afraid, you miserable coward.
- Father, in the name of...
- Shut your mouth!
Yes, afraid.
Afraid of an honest duel in magic... you pitiful old goat.
- Enough, sir.
- You shriveled-up old...
Enough, sir. What am I to do?
Can't you decide for yourself?
Proceed.
Now!
Now we shall see who is the master of all magicians.
Can you not stop him?
I will do what I can, sir, but... as you see, he seems bent upon revenge.
Now!
Father, you mustn't do this.
Who are you to talk to me like that?
Father, you are in no condition...
Get back to the table!
Father, suppose he turns you into a raven.
That's none of your business!
Now...
Veni... Vedi...
Vici!
Ow!
You're defending yourself, you coward, huh?
All right, take this.
Oh you... You dirty old man.
All right...
I'll give you my Promethean magic.
In that, I am unexcelled.
Be easy on him.
I'll do my very best.
Caveat canem!
Caveat canem.
Oh, dear.
He really shouldn't have tried... for that particular experiment.
It requires such enormous concentration.
Oh, dear.
Raspberry jam.
If I might suggest,
I think perhaps your daughter... should lie down and rest awhile, dear doctor.
- The shock of all this.
- We must leave now, father.
Leave? Oh, no.
The storm is much too violent.
Wait till morning, dear child.
Then leave... refreshed.
Good night, Estelle.
Keep your door locked.
I will. Good night, father.
Good night.
I was afraid you'd scream.
Is anything wrong?
Don't be alarmed... but I'm afraid Dr. Scarabus killed my father.
Killed him?
Yes, during the dueling...
I observed Dr. Scarabus making furtive gestures... with his fingers.
Now we must speak to your father.
But I already have.
He trusts Dr. Scarabus.
We'll have to try it.
It's locked.
What will we do?
What are you doing?
This ledge leads to your father's room.
But you might be killed.
I hope not.
Lenore!
Lenore?
Lenore!
Did you have to make the weather so cold?
Did you have to see him?
Well I was curious.
I wanted to have a look at him as long as he was here.
As long as you couldn't kill him on the way.
How was I to know that you wanted Erasmus here?
You never tell me anything.
Besides, I thought he might find out about me... and make an unpleasant scene.
Would you undo me, please?
Your hands are so cold.
I'm always fascinated by your utter lack of scruples.
You knew what you were getting.
Did I ever pretend that I came here... because of your charm?
I came here because of your wealth and your power... and in return I gave you my company.
And if you insist on anything more... you will only succeed in boring me... whereupon I shall leave you as I left Erasmus.
How, my darling treasure?
By making me think that you have died?
Hardly.
Tell me, my... precious viper... how did you know that he was coming here... since, as you pointed out so petulantly...
I never tell you anything?
I didn't, at first.
I only guessed... after you turned that dismal little fat man into a blackbird.
A raven, my love.
Whatever.
I knew he wouldn't go for help... to a magician who was in the brotherhood.
Of course!
And that left only Dr. Craven.
How deftly nimble is your mind.
Why were you so sure that Bedlo would see... a portrait of me in Erasmus' house?
If you wanted Erasmus here... wasn't it a rather farfetched way of bringing him here?
After more than two years with me, dear Lenore... do you still think I make my plans in a farfetched way... leave anything to chance?
What do you mean?
Come with me and see.
Let go!
And don't sit on my chest, you...
I'm not an armchair, you idiot!
Come on, help me up.
Help me.
Don't look at me like that.
- What am I, a ghost?
- But I saw you killed!
Can't you speak quietly, you idiot?
I just wanted Scarabus to think that I was dead... so I could help if he moved against any of you.
- He already has.
- Has what?
Just now, I almost killed myself coming from Miss Craven's room.
She's locked in.
What are you doing in a lady's room?
Father, that's beside the point.
I decide what's beside the point!
All right, I went there to warn her... if you must know.
Dr. Scarabus has imprisoned her.
Imprisoned her?
Then we must get her out.
But what about her father?
Never mind!
I'll take care of her father!
Let's hide there.
Now, you wait here... and as soon as Scarabus passes, get the girl out of her room... and get her out of here.
But what about you?
Never mind me. Do as I tell you... for once in your life.
Well...
I think it's very rude to keep your guests waiting.
Thank heaven you're all right.
- Quickly, Estelle.
- Where are we going?
- Out of here.
- Without my father?
- Estelle, we have to leave.
- Not without my father.
You sly old thing, you.
And what was his price?
Mine? A double value... superior magical knowledge... and through my death by lightning... freedom from overbearing women.
Well worth the cost of being turned into an insignificant bird.
To say nothing of luring
Dr. Craven to me.
Don't forget that, my love.
I can't imagine why you want him here.
It's not Craven I want.
It's his magic.
Father? Father, we must leave.
Leave?
Yes. I've been locked in my room.
Rexford had to let me out.
- What is it, father?
- I saw Lenore.
Please, my father said we had to go as soon as possible.
- Your father?
- Yes. He's still alive.
His death was a trick.
Now, please, we must go.
Very well.
Come along, Bedlo.
You're wasting time.
One moment. One moment.
I don't think you quite appreciate what I went through.
You should have warned me... that feathers are a very inadequate protection... for a poor raven on a cold December night.
I don't even want to mention the pin feathers.
They itch!
But you should have warned me about the hawks!
- Hawks?
- Yes, the hawks!
On my way over to Dr. Craven,
I was attacked three times.
And then when I got there I had to discover he didn't even know how to turn me back into a man.
A man?
If I wouldn't have known the formula myself...
I would still be a raven.
I liked you better that way.
Oh, I must find Dr. Bedlo.
But, sir, he told me not to...
And to top it off...
I'm nearly chopped to pieces by that insane coachman... and nearly killed by my own son!
Have you quite finished? You have.
It's time to separate
Dr. Craven from his secrets.
Are we going to have some torture?
That won't be necessary.
I have his daughter.
Daughter?
That's a... That's a very good idea.
You really think so, do you?
What are you going to do?
Come.
Hurry, father!
Congratulations, Dr. Scarabus!
What are you doing now?
Hey, what are you doing with your cheap tricks?
Is that how you reward my services to you?
You ungrateful hellhound!
Fear not.
You will receive your just reward.
Not quite ready.
Can't you get your hands free, father?
I'm afraid not, my dear... what with Dr. Scarabus having turned me into a statue... and then binding me like this.
I know I...
I know I'm a disgrace.
I had a somewhat stronger word in mind.
But, son, you know that... that everything I've tried in life...
I was a failure.
Only...
Only the day I joined the brotherhood of magicians.
Oh I... I was the happiest man on earth.
I still remember how happy I was.
And then when Dr. Scarabus offered to teach me... superior magical knowledge for luring Dr. Craven here...
I just couldn't resist that magnificent award.
But, Erasmus, believe me... with all my heart,
I regret what I did to you.
You are not alone in guilt, sir.
I, too, have failed at the task of living.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes. Yes.
Instead of facing life,
I turned my back on it.
I know now why my father resisted Scarabus... because he knew that one cannot fight evil by hiding from it.
Men like Scarabus thrive on the apathy of others.
He's thrived on mine, and that offends me.
By avoiding contact with the brotherhood...
I've given him freedom... to commit his atrocities unopposed.
You sure have.
I'm sorry.
Bravo, Erasmus.
A splendid dissertation.
Lenore!
Well... You still look the same.
So does the girl.
You're alive!
Very much alive.
Yes, so I see.
That was someone else's body in the casket.
I left you for Scarabus.
No.
What has Scarabus done to you?
Are you under a spell?
Spell.
It's nothing but greed.
Speak to me, Lenore.
Speak to me, my beloved.
Erasmus, you're still just as much a bore as ever.
Well now, gentlemen,
I think we are ready to begin.
I'm not ready.
No? You disagree?
Dr. Scarabus...
I'll do anything you want.
Just don't hurt me.
Father!
Come on, let me go.
But what about the others?
What others? I don't care what you do with them.
Dr. Bedlo...
I don't care if you turn me into a raven.
I don't care if you send me out into the cold night.
I don't care about the hawks and pin feathers.
Anything!
Anything is better than death!
Might be more amusing.
You really don't care what happens to your friends?
No. Why should I?
Such perfection of treachery fills me with admiration.
Since Dr. Craven will never have the opportunity of helping you again.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So farewell to Dr. Bedlo... as he flaps away to his well-deserved oblivion.
Gort.
Now, dear doctor... we'll take your charming daughter outside.
No! Father!
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
I wonder.
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Estelle!
Estelle!
Scarabus, you maniac!
Father! Father!
Somebody help me!
Estelle!
Dr. Craven...
Oh, for my hands. My hands!
Now, dear doctor,
I offer you a choice.
The secret of your hand manipulations... or this against this.
Don't tell him, father!
I'd rather die than have you tell him!
Is that your wish, too, dear doctor?
You didn't run... I mean, fly away?
Is that what you thought?
What else was I supposed to think?
All right, all right. Never mind.
You always did think like your mother.
We're wasting time, doctor.
Perhaps the sight of your daughter's flesh being seared... will clarify your thinking.
Now do something right for a change.
Your final...
Enough. This is no answer.
Is there an answer, then, Dr. Scarabus?
Yes.
A duel to the death.
Reconcile yourself to it, doctor.
One of us must perish.
Very well, then.
A duel to the death.
Erasmus!
Erasmus, darling!
The moment you defeated him...
I felt as if a great cloud had been lifted from my mind.
I'm free from his control.
Take me home.
- Well I...
- Father.
Personally, I think...
And that's enough out of you.
Yes, you're right, Estelle.
We can go home now.
Come along, young man.
Erasmus, what is it?
No, Erasmus, you don't understand!
Scarabus had me under his control!
I didn't know what I was doing!
No! Erasmus!
- You can't do this to me!
- Lenore.
So the grand master's been defeated.
Look at my dress!
Can't you do anything right?
All right, darling, hold still.
I'll attend to that for you.
Now, hold still.
Now look what you've done!
You've destroyed it!
I'm afraid I just don't have it anymore.
Thank you, my dear.
Good night, children.
Erasmus.
Now that Scarabus is out of the way... we've got to make immediate plans... for your assumption of the grand mastership.
I'll be glad to act as your liaison... so you won't be bothered having to present your case... personally to the brotherhood.
Later on, I'll be happy to assume the post... of supernumerary, secretary and dispenser...
- Dr. Bedlo.
- Yes?
Do you really think that such treachery... can be so easily forgiven and forgotten?
Treachery?
I saved all your lives.
After having put them in jeopardy in the first place.
That's beside the point.
Very well.
If that's the way you feel about it... kindly return me to my rightful form, and I'll leave.
Well, I'll...
I'll take it under advisement.
Take it under advisement?
Well, really.
Who do you think you're talking to, anyway?
- Up.
- What's that?
- Up.
- Now wait a minute, Erasmus.
- Up!
- Really!
I never heard of such ingratitude in my entire life.
It's getting so you can't trust anybody anymore.
I'm just too sweet and gentle.
That's my trouble.
- Dr. Bedlo.
- What is it?
Shut your beak.
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."

- Want gas, mister?
- Yeah, fill it up.
Help yourself, will you, please?
I gotta close up.
To you know how to get to Blackbeard's Inn at Godolphin?
I'm goin' there myself. I'll show you the way if you'll give me a lift.
- You're on.
- Thanks.
- Stayin' at the inn?
- Yep.
Mostly old ladies live there.
Salesmen goin' through like to stay in Ye Jolly Roger down in town.
Got more of a chance to kick up their heels.
Well, I'm not a salesman. I'm the new track coach at Godolphin College.
Coach, I'm glad to know you!
My name's Gudger Larkin.
I'm on your track squad.
I'm captain.
Well, well.
Small world, isn't it?
Let's see now, Captain.
I'd guess you were a sprinter, huh?
Golly, no, sir. I'm-I'm as slow as molasses in January.
- Can you give me a hand, Coach?
- Oh, yeah.
- Say, what is your event, Larkin?
- Oh, I'm the shot putter, sir.
Shot putter? Well, the weight man's usually the strongest man on the team.
Yes, sir.
That's the inn, Coach.
That's Blackbeard's Inn.
- Did the old pirate really build it?
- Sure.
He got killed in a battle right out there in the bay.
I guess I'll have to brush up on the local history.
Wait till you meet the little old ladies who run the inn.
They're all descendants of Blackbeard's bloody crew, and they're proud of it.
"Buccaneer Bazaar tonight.
Help save Blackbeard's Inn."
- What does that mean?
- Some guy's trying to have the inn torn down... but the old ladies are putting up a pretty good fight.
You sure they haven't started to tear it down already?
Well, I'll tell you, it's built mostly of odds and ends.
Timbers of ships that got wrecked in the bay.
- You can park over there.
- All right.
What's that all about?
Hey, buddy, l...
That's Silky Seymour.
He runs the gambling around here.
- I wouldn't fool with him.
- What's he doing at the old ladies' bazaar?
He's the guy that bought up their mortgage from the bank.
If the old ladies don't come up with the loot, out they go.
- This fellow Seymour gets everything he wants around here, huh?
- Just about.
Miss Jeffrey, have you seen Miss Stowecroft?
This gentleman has a room reservation.
She's outside in a tent telling fortunes.
- Dean Wheaton.
- What is it?
Sir, l-I'd like you to meet our new track coach.
Steve Walker, sir. Just arrived.
I believe I'm to report to you in the morning.
- Uh, Welcome to Godolphin, Mr Walker.
- Thank you very much, sir.
I don't want to seem negative, but I want to be frank.
I was not in favour of replacing our former track coach when he left so informally.
- Oh?
- For some years now, the track team has done precious little... to add lustre to the name of Godolphin College... so there didn't seem any point in going on with it, you see?
- Well, I'm sorry to hear that, sir...
- Howsoever, we have competed... in the Broxton Relays for the past 63 years... so the alumni insisted on one more try.
Well, of course, sir, there's not much time left before the relay is here... but I hope I can restore your confidence in the boys.
Mr Walker, I never had any.
Well, mmm, before the warmth of the dean's reception goes to my head...
I think I'll find Miss Stowecroft and get a room.
I've been on the road since 5:00 this morning.
- Okay, Coach. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Gudger... uh, what did happen to the other track coach?
I don't know.
He got to actin' real weird.
Talkin' to himself, real down in the chops.
And one day, he just disappeared.
Just... and he was gone.
- Good night, Gudger.
- Good night, Coach.
Oh, Mr Walker.
This is Mr Purvis... our football coach, whom you undoubtedly know by reputation.
Well, I certainly do.
Who doesn't?
We're very fortunate in having the services of Mr Purvis.
He produces winning football teams... which in turn produce gratifyingly large grants and endowments from proud alumni.
Mr Walker is the new coach of what we refer to as the track team.
The track team.
Oh, Walker, you won't last three weeks.
Take my word for it.
Well, if you don't mind, Mr Purvis,
I'd like to find that out for myself.
A word of advice, friend.
At, uh, Godolphin, the name of the game is football.
- That's what makes the mare go around here, so, uh...
- Football.
Don't get any big ideas.
- Wouldn't dream of it.
- Oh, well, come along, Mr Purvis.
I'm sure that Mr Walker will acclimatize very quickly.
Track team!
- Miss Stowecroft?
- Sit down, Ishmael.
No, my name's Steve Walker,
Miss Stowecroft.
I believe a room was arranged for me here through the college.
- You know, living accommodations?
- We accommodate the living.
But who shall accommodate the dead?
Give me your hand, Ishmael.
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't want my fortune told.
Just a room, Miss Stowecroft.
There's a revelation here.
Dark deeds and violence.
Things roused up that were better left to rot.
If you'll tell me where the keys are, Miss Stowecroft...
- I'd be happy to...
- Hold. There's more to the revelation.
- We see good here too.
- Oh, well, that's good.
Happiness. Happiness and content for the people of Godolphin... delivered from an ancient evil, and gratitude to you, Ishmael...
- Oh.
- Who have sacrificed your own life... in their delivery.
Now the light fades.
That is all.
- Now, about the room, Miss Stowecroft...
- That's all.
- Yes, but...
- You may leave an honorarium... for the care and welfare of the spirits in the bowl on your way out.
Oh, thank you. Come again.
Hi.
Hey! What's the big idea?
Well, kisses, one buck, right?
But I don't work here. Can't you read?
I'm executive committee.
I work here.
Well, now, so you do.
Well, that is what I call a real good dollar kiss.
- Plenty of value for the money.
- Would you hold this a minute, please?
How would you like to try the five-dollar special?
Five-dollar special.
May I have my badge?
Thank you.
Oh, no, I'm terribly sorry.
Only one to a customer.
Excuse me.
Oh, Miss Stowecroft.
If I could get that room now, please?
Oh, Ishmael! Come along, please.
The auction is about to begin.
Ladies and gentlemen of Godolphin and neighbouring community... you all know the purpose of this bazaar.
Our good friends, the Daughters of the Buccaneers... took over this old ruin many years ago and turned it into a cultural landmark.
They serve tea, cooked chicken dinners... even turned part of it into a boarding house... anything to keep it going, but that's not enough.
And unless enough money is raised tonight... this place that has been their home for so many years... will pass into the hands of strangers.
So, when Miss Stowecroft begins to auction off... the treasured mementoes, the fine antiques and the family heirlooms... that these good ladies have so generously donated to the cause...
I beg you to search your hearts and to bid cheerfully... boldly and very, very generously.
Thank you. Miss Stowecroft.
Thank you, Professor Baker.
Lot number one.
A fine antique pistol... which has been in the immediate family of Miss Emily Jeffrey... past president of the Daughters of the Buccaneers... for many, many years.
- Now...
- Uh, one dollar.
Oh, can't we do better than that?
Who'll give me $20?
Do I hear $20?
Oh, the gentleman in the back just waved.
The gentleman in the back says, "$20."
Who'll give me $30?
- Thirty dollars.
- Thirty-five dollars.
- Forty.
- Fifty dollars.
- Sixty dollars.
- Seventy.
Do I hear $80?
- Eighty dollars!
- One hundred dollars!
One hundred dollars bid!
Do I hear 110?
Professor Baker, how about your nice young man in the back?
Oh, I don't think so.
He just backed into his shell.
Very well.
One hundred dollars once.
One hundred dollars twice.
Sold!
All right, move in.
- One hundred dollars.
- Thank you.
- Lot number two. A genuine antique...
- You got taken, buddy. This is a fake.
- Copper-bottomed bed warmer.
- Take my advice.
Don't bid on anything else.
- I think well over 250 years old.
- You mean the warming pan is fake too?
That's tourist junk.
- And Mr Seymour don't like to see you throw your money away.
- Ladies and gentlemen... this bed warmer is believed to have been the property of Aldetha Teach... tenth wife of our dear
Captain Blackbeard.
- And now, what am I bid?
- If you want to bid, go ahead, but, uh,
I don't think Mr Seymour would like it.
Mrs Starkey, how about starting the bidding for us?
N-No, thanks.
I, I don't think so.
- How about you, Mr Finch?
- Oh, uh, no, no, thank you.
Uh, Mr Harrison, you'll open the bidding for us, I know.
This pistol's enough for me.
Oh. Will no one open the bidding... on this magnificent item?
- Five dollars!
- Well, thank you.
- Ten dollars.
- Mr Virgil Purvis... our football coach, bids $ 10.
- Fifteen.
- Twenty dollars.
- Twenty-five.
- Thirty dollars.
- Thirty-five.
- Fifty dollars.
- Fifty-five.
- Sixty.
- Sixty-five.
- Seventy!
- Five!
- One hundred dollars!
- As we all know...
Mr Virgil Purvis, our football coach, doesn't like to lose.
He very generously bids $ 100.
Just an opinion, but I wouldn't bid any more if I were you.
- Are there any other bids?
- Well, now, why is that?
- No reason. I just don't want you to.
- One hundred dollars going once.
- Oh.
- One hundred dollars twice.
- Two hundred dollars.
- Two hundred dollars once.
Two hundred dollars twice. Sold to the nice young gentleman in back.
Now we're really rolling!
- Excuse me.
- Lot number three.
Here we have a fascinating piece from colonial times.
The clock in the gentleman's stomach keeps perfect time.
- Now, what am I bid?
- New around here, aren't you?
- Yeah.
- Do I hear $20?
- Just passing through?
- Nope.
- Thirty dollars.
- Might stick around a while, huh?
- Thirty-five dollars.
- Might.
- Thank you.
- We'll see each other again.
- Fifty dollars.
- Good night.
- Eighty dollars.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How'd you make out?
- Fine. Much better than we expected.
- Thank you.
- That's good. No problem, then?
Oh, I wish that were true.
We still have another $38,000... to give Mr Seymour before the first of the month.
Say, why is Mr Seymour so anxious to get his hands on this property anyway?
Here, I'll show you on the map.
You see, this is... this is the island we're on.
Well, in Blackbeard's time, the river flowed this way.
And the inn wasn't on an island at all.
It was part of the mainland.
Then about, oh, 80 years ago, we had this terrible flood and a storm... and the, uh, the river changed its course... isolating the inn from the mainland.
As a result, nobody's ever been able to clarify... what the legal jurisdiction of the island really is.
- Th-That's where Mr Seymour comes in?
- Sure.
He can tear down the inn, put up a big, modern casino...
- and the law can't bother him.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, uh, well, I'd like to thank you for what you did tonight.
You know, without you, we wouldn't have had much of an auction.
Well, I just kept bidding because it made you smile.
I like that smile.
Jo Anne, aren't you re...
I've been waiting to drive you home.
Excuse me. Good night.
Good night.
I'm going to put you in his room.
I'm sure he won't mind.
- He?
- Captain Blackbeard.
- Oh.
This looks out to the river and to the upper bay.
Oh, the captain used to stand here for hours with his spyglass... studying the ships moving in and out.
He'd pick out the one he liked... then he'd come here to this very table... and with his men, he'd plan how to seize it.
Well, thank you, Miss Stowecroft.
I know how anxious you must be to get to bed, so...
Sometimes when he's in a bad mood or feeling Ionely... we hear him thumping around, breaking glasses and bottles... trying so hard to communicate with us.
I suppose we should all be very angry with him for all that noise.
But, you know, it isn't his fault, poor man.
Then, whose fault is it?
- Aldetha's, of course.
- Who?
Number ten.
The captain's last wife, but one.
Oh, the one your warming pan belonged to.
- Oh. Well, good...
- Aldetha was a witch, you know.
She never forgave the captain for denouncing her to the authorities.
When they were burning
Aldetha at the stake... she put a terrible curse on him.
As the flames crept higher and higher... she screeched her dying words:
"Edward Teach, sometimes known as Captain Blackbeard...
"when you come to die, may your body and soul...
"be racked between this world and the next...
"always to be alone.
"May this curse hold fast and true.
"May you dwell forevermore in limbo...
"or until such time as there be found in you...
"most wicked of all villains... some spark of human goodness."
Well, good night, Mr Walker.
Sleep well.
The dining room will be open for breakfast at 7:30 a.m.
Oh, please be prompt.
Oh, no.
Two hundred bucks.
"Aldetha Teach."
Well, so the thing did belong to her.
"Her book of spells and conjurations."
Well, now.
"A spell to turn your enemy into a spotted toad."
"A spell to turn mercury into gold."
I wonder if there's a spell to make a track team out of a pig's ear.
"A spell to bring to your eyes and ears... one who is bound in limbo."
Well, how about that? Limbo.
Curses. Pirates. Malarky.
Blackbeard himself was a phony.
He was probably some chicken-livered little pipsqueak... that built up a reputation scaring old women and children.
Chicken-livered pipsqueak, is it?
A remark spoke slighted like that... could raise a man's blood now, could it not?
I've been on the road since 5:00 this morning. I'm just tired.
Nothing to eat. Miss Stowecroft gassed me up with pirate stories.
I'm all right. I'm just tired.
Boy, am I tired!
I don't think you're real.
I don't think that sword is real!
And I'm gonna walk right through it and go to bed!
Try it, mate.
- It's real.
- Who called me out?
- What?
- Who invoked me?
Aldetha's writing. No!
Aldetha done it.
"Beware," cried me shipmates.
"Sheer off. That girl, she be a true witch."
And I paid no heed.
Oh, Aldetha.
To do that to your legal spoke husband. Oh!
The story is,
Blackbeard had her burned.
Burned? I never put a taper to her. Never.
Oh, I own that down in the horse latitudes, on a dull day...
I might've keel-hauled a wife or two, or else walked one off the end of a plank, yes.
But I never did it for spite.
Funny thing about me.
Never did it for spite.
I might've done it out of, uh, jest... to keep the spirit of me shipmates up.
And now to real business.
Where'd you stow it?
- What? What?
- Your rum.
- I don't drink.
- Don't drink?
Ship's stores.
Have to seek succor there.
Ah, Mrs Stowecroft, your humble servant. Servant.
A bottle of rum
No glasses are left
I'll drink from the bottle with you, sir
You don't know what you're missing, son.
- She didn't see you.
- Aye?
- She didn't even hear you.
- Oh, why should she?
I'm a kind of a ghost, you know.
In limbo, caught twixt this world and the next... beholden to that spell which brings me to your eyes only.
You mean, no one can see you except me?
That's about the shape of it, son.
And that's why I'll be sailing alongside of you, see?
Wheresoever thou goest, there also will I go.
So let's drink to that. Are you sure you don't want to freshen your spleen?
Now, let's get one thing straight!
I want nothing to do with you!
I'm go...
I'm gonna go to bed... and you can go back into the woodwork or wherever it is you came from!
Belay that tongue! One thing old Blackbeard don't take kindly to... it's them sort of "insinuendos."
Come to think of it, I don't care for the cut of your jib, neither.
If I were to lay this course,
I'd choose myself a companion... a hearty companion, with a little blood on his sleeve... and a predilection for rum, for song... and for the occasional wench.
But what have I got? Hmm?
I've got a shindly little beanrake.
- Now, wait!
- Yes, I have. With the shakes and the whimpers.
- What do you mean the sh-shakes and...
- Doesn't even want to join me in a drink.
We're stuck with one another, you and I.
The cruise may well be a long one, so you'd better make the best of it.
And I take this opportunity of bidding you a very good night.
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!
Get off of my bed!
- Your bed?
- My bed!
"My bed"? I captured it from a Portugee trader at the sack of Cartagena!
- I spitted him clean and sweet against the headboard!
- Well, l...
Don't rush me.
There it is.
There's your Portugee, what's left of him.
Well, if you think
I'm gonna sleep on the floor, you've got another thing coming!
Oh, well then, welcome aboard and drop your hook.
Devil is the man whoever said that old Teach was inhospitable.
All I ask is to be able to get to sleep, because I know... because I know that when I wake up tomorrow morning, none of this will have ever happened.
Nine men... Down!
Oh, when nine and twenty Spanish lads
You pull it on the sheets, my boy
Up! The Jolly Roger!
Wind freshening, aye, Mr Bellamy.
El Portugee, it's your daughter
I'm after, senor, not your bed.
Don Mendoza, we meet again.
Pick up your weapon, sir.
Take my regards to the king of Spain!
Bellamy! Oh!
That's it!
That is absolutely it!
Figment of my imagination or no figment, he can have his room.
He can have his bed!
I don't need it.
I'm going to the Ye Jolly Roger Motel where the salesmen go.
Well, nothing like a little fresh air to straighten you out.
For a while there, I almost believed there was a pirate.
Oh, no. You're back! Right?
That be about the measure of it, lad.
I fear there's no way of being rid of dear old Blackbeard.
Well, that's great.
That is just great!
I couldn't have an ordinary ghost on my hands! I got a rummy!
- A big, ugly, booze-soaked rummy!
- Hold on there!
There be no call to put the fuddler's name on your new-found shipmate.
Uh, look, lad...
I've been very Ionely, see.
I'm just an old hulk, wrecked on a lee shore.
All my shipmates gone, no one to listen to me no more.
You don't care for me, that's plain as print.
- Shut up, will ya? Shut up.
Ju-Ju-Just shut up.
- Aye. Aye, aye.
You wouldn't have such a thing as an handkerchief...
- on your person, would you?
- I don't have a handkerchief.
- Oh, you must, do you?
- Keep your hands to yourself!
No!
What manner of craft be this we're cruisin' in?
- What?
- This craft.
- Oh. It's an automobile.
- Aye?
- An automobile!
- Oh, is it? Yes, "automotonees."
- Yes, "autosomonees."
- Hey, sit down!
It's propelled by some kind of animal under the hatch, is it?
No, it isn't! Sit down now.
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
- I've a mind to have a hand at the helm.
- Well, you've got another mind coming!
- You're gonna kill us, you idiot!
- Take your hands off the spokes... or I'll bend a marlinspike around your loaf!
- I'll take that wheel.
- I haven't finished my turn yet.
- Wait!
- Get away from there! It's my turn.
- Get your hands off the wheel!
- Feels like a weather helm, don't it?
- I'll show her who's master!
- No! No, no! No, no! No, no!
No, no, no!
- We're in the breakers, boy!
- Get out!
Back the main braces!
Stand by to wear ship now!
Take your foot off of my gas!
- Look out!
- Read about. Hard alee. Hard alee.
Avast, ya lubber!
What are you doin' in the main channel?
Oh, no, not a policeman!
Let... Let go! Let go!
Look, I'll give you the wheel later.
Right now, l...
You've done it now, you dumb ox!
Steer out of the whirlpool!
Man overboard!
Your driver's licence, please.
- Who's the popinjay?
- Will you stay out of this?
Well, Mr Walker, I see we've been out getting our nose wet somewhere tonight.
It so happens, I don't drink.
And what is that on the seat beside you?
- It looks like a bottle of rum.
- May I have it, please?
I believe you're right, Mr Walker.
It is a bottle of rum.
Let the swab find his own rum, I say!
Will you give me this bottle and stop maying a nuisance out of yourself?
I'll take charge of that bottle, if you don't mind.
You let go of the bottle, you idiot!
No need for epithets, Mr Walker.
I'm only trying to do my job.
I'm afraid destruction of the evidence isn't going to help you any, Mr Walker.
Now this be the foulest crime of all... wasting good spirits.
By thunder, this raises me blood!
No, don't do it!
There's no need for you to get emotional about this.
You've had the fun.
Now you can take the consequences.
All right, lad, all right.
I shan't harm him.
But this gentleman needs a lesson in manners.
It's plain to see that you're starting to come apart at the seams.
All itchy, twitchy, talking to yourself.
- Cut it out, will you, Blackbeard?
- All right, get out of the car!
Hey, watch that thing! It's probably...
Hey, look out, will you!
Five balls in one load, mate.
Five!
Many's the time off the Maricaibos...
I could've done with a prime little darling like that.
Give way, you landlubber!
The key, you idiot!
The key!
Turn off the key!
Think you can get away from me, do you?
Calling Patrolman 9, we're at the corner of...
Hey, lad, that be better sport than riding a humpback whale in a hurricane!
Hey, care for a drench, son?
It'll brighten your scan.
- You're still here, huh?
- Aldetha's testament, I see.
Studying some way to get rid of poor old Blackbeard, are you?
- How'd you guess?
- I have been observing thee... and I note that you have a bent for getting yourself into trouble.
I get into trouble?
Oh, that is really rich!
Who do you suppose put me here?
Well, do you think I like this mortal life of yours?
Aye, there doesn't seem to be any honest joy any more.
Your modern life of yours seems to have got small.
Everything's puckered up.
You call this a four-poster bed?
Clear the way there!
I'm down.
You won't get no comfort out of that.
If it's Aldetha laid that spell, you can mark it a good one, without no loophole.
Now, wait a minute.
Mrs Stowecroft told me that curse.
Something about you having to dwell forevermore in limbo.
- Limbo.
- Then something, something, something...
Until there be found in you some spark of human goodness.
- What's the matter?
- Aldetha was bright as brass.
She knew me like a book.
Well, you must have done something good.
Did you ever...
Did you ever pat a dog?
- A dog?
- Yeah.
- Pet it?
- Yes.
- No, I never did pet it.
- Did you ever help an old lady across the street?
- That's silly.
- Anything?
- No.
- No.
No, we're sunk, you and me.
Dead as pork. Might as well... face up to it.
Hey. Hey, the little old ladies, the Daughters of the Buccaneers.
Your own kith and kin, some of them.
Give them your treasure.
- My treasure?
- Yeah.
The one that people have been talking about for so long. It's hidden somewhere around here, isn't it?
- Never mind.
- Eh?
- Why should I give them my treasure?
- Why, you great ape?
Because you can do some good with it.
You can help them.
In helping them, you might help yourself. You might break the curse.
- You thinks this, does ye?
- Yes, I thinks this.
If you help those little old ladies save their home... they'll name public schools and bridges and highways after you.
Can't you see it?
Teach Park.
Teach Highway. See?
The Edward Teach, uh, Memorial, uh, Free Day Nursery.
- Free?
- For babies.
- Oh, for babies.
- Yeah.
- Named for me, a wicked old pirate?
- Yeah.
And for nothing more than a few chests of doubloons and a few strands of precious jewels?
- You bet they will.
- And in spite of the fact... that I've got the blood of a thousand gallant lads still on my hands?
Will you forget the blood!
I mean, I'm trying!
Look, crack loose with the treasure, huh? It's the only way.
- Well, it don't sound right to me.
- Of course it doesn't sound right to you!
How would a creep like you know the difference between right and wrong?
That's why the curse held on so long. Now, come on.
- Where's the treasure?
- Well, I suppose I must trust you.
- Yeah. Where is it?
- The treasure?
- Yeah.
- Want to know the treasure?
- Yeah.
Hmm? Where is it?
Where's the treasure?
- There ain't no treasure.
- There ain't... What?
No! Not a penny. There's not a doubloon.
There's not a bent or damaged peseta.
That is one of the most outrageous things that I have ever...
Do you realize people have been searching for that treasure for over two centuries? Huh?
Poor, unfortunate souls grubbing and digging in the dirt!
I'm not good for nothing!
I'm not, I'm not!
Grubbing in the dirt, old poor people there...
Oh, don't start crying again.
Look, you must have saved a few coins somewhere. Something?
- No, no.
- I did have a treasure.
- Yeah?
- I had a big treasure.
- Yeah?
- Lovely, I did.
- Yes.
- I spent it all in one week... among the fleshpots and gambling halls of Port Royal.
- Oh, it was a glorious week, that was.
- You know what you are?
You are a 100% total loss.
You're not even a respectable ghost!
You're a phony!
- Aye?
- A phony!
Oh, I've run aground.
If you ask me, the guy was stoned.
I say get rid of him.
The police report said they released him for lack of evidence.
It says, "Although the atmosphere at the police station... reeked of cheap rum, the test showed no trace of alcohol in his system."
Oh, he probably figured some cute way to neutralize the booze.
Pills or something. Science is doing all kinds of stuff like that these days.
Well, there's a corollary.
It says that Mr Walker spoke loudly to someone in his cell all night long.
Well, there's nothing wrong with that.
It happened there was on one in the cell with him.
So he's either stoned or he's nuts.
Either way, who needs it?
Professor, I left last night before the auction.
Did you notice anything unusual in Mr Walker's behaviour?
- Yes, I did.
- There. You see?
When Silky Seymour and his cheap hoodlums scared the daylights out of everyone else... he is the only one that stood up like a man.
Now, wait a minute, Jo Anne.
That's not fair.
If I may remind you, Dean, the
Broxton Relays take place next month, and our team needs its coach.
- They need Mr Walker.
- I still say we ought to saw him off.
This guy's not gonna come up with anything.
Just a minute, Mr Purvis.
Now, we have fielded a team in the
Broxton Relays for the past 63 years.
We'll carry on the tradition as best we can with Mr Walker.
Well, I'm sure you won't regret it.
- Oh, Professor?
- Yes?
I realize that your field is child psychology... however I'd appreciate it if you'd keep an informal eye on Mr Walker's behaviour.
Oh, certainly.
It's the least I can do.
Thank you.
Mr Purvis, does it strike you as odd... that sooner or later, all our track coaches seem to crack up?
I can understand the others, but this one hasn't even seen the team.
Say, why has Fellspahr got his fingers in his ears? That's...
- It's on account of the starter, sir.
- You mean he's...
Yes, sir.
Fellspahr is afraid of guns.
Th-The way I figure it,
Coach, is we need more time to whip these boys into shape.
You don't suppose they could postpone the Broxton meet, do you?
No.
Okay, fellas, that's it for today.
Hit the showers.
Right, Coach. Let's go, fellas!
You all go now! Lots of spirit!
How fares your day today, eh?
As if I don't have enough troubles.
For a short, wonderful while there,
I thought I'd lost you.
You know where I've been?
I've been in Godolphin Town... roaming the streets and shores of my young manhood...
- Yeah.
- Soaking myself in nostalgia.
I know. I can smell it!
And you know, as fate would have it...
I went down to one of these here gambling establishments...
- by name Silky's Place.
- Hey, take off, will you?
- I've got a lot to do.
- And I overheard what some of the natives are saying... on this here subject of gambling, see?
- Go away! I mean it!
- Now, if there's been one abiding passion in my life... it's been the pleasure of gold or silver coin upon a wager.
So when I heard that I could get 40 or... listen to this... 50 to 1... on the forthcoming enterprise of your young rabbits...
- Ooh, with all that...
- What?
You want your lads to win, don't you?
I can teach you how to do it.
- Forget it!
- Why should I?
I was a good hand at teaching young crews.
'Twas no accident, by thunder,
I was known as the finest pirate... ever to sail the Spanish Main.
Or the Portugee Main either, for that matter.
Now you'll be asking yourself with some impatience, "Why was this?"
I'll tell you why.
I trained my men to win!
Win! Always win!
By fair means or foul, by soft words and hard deeds... by treachery, by cunning, by malpractice... but always win.
You mean you have the unmitigated brass to ask me to let you train my team?
I'm not doing this for myself, believe me. No.
I'm doing this for those dear, sweet old ladies.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes, I am.
The little lavender-scented ladies,
I like to call them... that stagger up their rickety staircases of the night... their lanterns held aloft when the lights got too bad for knitting by... and say to one another,
"Ellen, where is our ship?"
Of which Blackbeard is captain.
"And which may never now come to port at all."
Never mind the snow job!
I feel just as sorry for those old women as you do, but that doesn't...
- No.
- Yes, I do. That doesn't give you leave to put your bloody paws onto my team.
Now, you stay away from those boys, you understand me?
If we win anything, which I doubt, we're gonna do it without cheating.
Without cheating? Ha-ha!
You've never lived, boy.
You don't know what life is like.
Just go away! Go maroon yourself somewhere, will ya?
- Let me help you.
- Go on! Go on!
You don't know what life is made of!
Little old things...
You see?
There he goes again.
Well, I don't know what his problem is.
But whatever it is, it's a beaut.
I take it your observations so far have been inconclusive.
Well, I can't tell if he's all keyed up over the track meet... or if there are outside pressures we don't know about.
L... Well, I just haven't been able to get a close-range view.
- Pity.
- Oh, I am having dinner with him tonight.
Ah, he asked you to have dinner?
Well, not exactly.
I asked him.
Do you think that's wise?
Well, it's entirely within my discretionary power... as head of the committee to welcome new faculty and students to Godolphin College.
Professor Baker, we don't have any such committee.
- Well, we do now.
- Oh. Oh, yes.
Hello, Professor.
Nice to see you.
Mr Walker, so we meet again.
- Looks that way.
- Tell you what.
Let me buy you a good lobster dinner.
Afterwards, we'll drop into the back rooms and have a whirl at lady luck, huh?
Well, thank you, but, well, that's not likely.
Suit yourself. There's no harm in asking, is there?
Leon, these are friends of mine.
See that they get a nice table.
Yes, sir.
This way, please.
Enjoy your dinner.
- What's he doing here?
- Mr Seymour owns this place.
I'm sorry, but it's the best restaurant in town.
How's the action?
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this.
- Appreciate what?
- Your suggesting dinner tonight.
That's perfectly all right.
The committee stands ready... to advise, counsel, and extend a helping hand to the newcomer at all times.
Yes, that's very nice. Actually,
I do need someone I can talk to.
I've had a problem for a couple of weeks now... and I've been afraid to talk to somebody because... they might think I was silly.
- Well, please go on.
- Thank you.
You see, it started the night of the auction.
I sat down on the bed to remove my shoes.
I was tired. I wasn't paying too much attention to what I was doing... and I sat right down on that antique bed warmer.
- I broke the handle right off.
- Oh, well, you mustn't let that bother you.
- Oh, no, it wasn't that.
- No, l-I think I have th-the address... of a little shop down on Main Street where we can get it fixed.
No, Professor, wait a minute.
Wow!
What's the matter?
Aren't you afraid to carry all that around with you?
Oh, well, I'm... I hate to leave it in the apartment.
I'm-I'm taking it to the bank in the morning. It belongs to the Daughters of the Buccaneers.
Oh, oh, yeah. The little old ladies and their mortgage.
I hope they're gonna make it.
Mr Walker, this is only $900.
Unless $37,000 or a miracle, preferably both... turn up by tomorrow night, midnight, those little ladies are gonna lose their home.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Say, uh, can't you borrow the money from the bank?
Well, not at the moment, but, uh, then we were talking about your problem.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, my problem.
- Mr Walker?
- Yeah?
- Are we looking for somebody?
- Yes, my problem.
Look, I know your first inclination is gonna be... boy, is gonna be not to believe this.
- Hear me out, please.
- Certainly.
Well, as I said, it was the night of the auction.
- When I sat down on my bed warmer, that's when he first appeared.
- He?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was because of him
I spent the first night in jail...
- and I haven't been able to get him off my back yet.
- Well, is, uh, is he here now?
No, no, no, no.
I don't see him around now.
- But I smell him.
- Smell him?
Yes, he's got a breath that would stun a horse.
He's a booze-guzzling old cutthroat, and he's latched onto me as his buddy-buddy.
Well, uh, does he have a name?
Well, I mean, who does he claim to be?
Blackbeard's ghost.
- Blackbeard's ghost?
- Yeah.
Well, how can you be sure he's the real Blackbeard's ghost, the ghost of Captain Teach?
Well, you ought to see him.
He's got whiskers, he's got a cutlass, he's got the whole bit.
- That must be who
I saw you talking to today.
- Yes, yes, yes.
That's what I've been afraid to tell anybody.
I mean, they'd think I was nuts.
Oh, well, I don't think anybody would think that.
But you certainly do have a problem.
- I've got a problem.
I've got a problem.
- Oh, yes, you...
- Will you order now, sir?
- Uh, yes, yes, thank you.
- Madame.
- Oh, thank you.
Our shore dinners are very good this evening, sir.
Well, that sounds... sounds good to me.
How about you, Professor?
- Oh, the shore dinners are excellent. Yeah, that's fine.
- Fine, fine. Uh, two shore dinners.
Very good, sir. Now, would you like our special dressing on your salads?
- That's fine.
- Thank you.
- Oh, please, go on.
- Oh. Oh, are you sure you want me to?
- I mean, I don't want to bug somebody else with my problems.
- Oh, no, no. I want to hear.
- Okay.
- Uh, you were telling me how you first met Captain Blackbeard.
Right.
- Where was I?
- Well, you were sitting on your antique bed warmer.
Right. The handle broke right off.
Do you know it turned out to be hollow?
I thought nothing of it for a moment, then I noticed... there was something rolled up inside... a dusty old paper.
I thought it was gonna fall apart right in my hands.
It gave me kind of a funny feeling.
Oh! Oh, you poor man.
- Waiter, did you hurt yourself?
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, that's quite all right.
It's just a little water.
- No harm done.
- Will madame please forgive me?
- Certainly.
- Hi, Danny.
- Hi.
You just missed the first race at Green Meadows.
Godolphin... to win...
Nine hundred dollars.
They're in the starting gate now.
There's the rabbit, and they're off!
Coming past the grandstand is Pilsen leading the field.
- Hello Baby is second...
- Come on, Baby!
Rainy Weather, third and Daddy Dumpling is fourth.
At the first turn, it's Pilsen by two lengths...
Rainy Weather moving into second,
Hello Baby and Daddy Dumpling.
- In the back stretch, it's Pilsen...
- This your bet, Danny?
- Daddy Dumpling is second, coming up.
- What do you think I'm standing here for?
Rainy Weather is fading.
Hello Baby is fading.
- I hope you know what you're doin'.
- Let me worry about that, will ya?
- It's Pilsen...
- Be right back.
Hello Baby.
Oh, Mr Seymour, take a look at this.
- Godolphin to win? Who's the patsy?
- Danny Oley. Okay?
Listen, his money's as good as anybody else's.
- Uh, what price are you making?
- On this one? Anything.
For an old customer like Danny, let's make it interesting... say, 50 to 1.
At the three-quarter pole, it's Daddy Dumpling.
Aunt Pavla is second. Pilsen is third.
Dandy Andy moving into fourth.
- It's Daddy Dumpling...
- Okay, Danny.
Into the stretch it's Dandy Andy and Aunt Pavla...
Daddy Dumpling and Snow Queen.
At the finish, it's Snow Queen,
Aunt Pavla and Daddy Dumpling.
Winsome Lass to win in the second.
- What's the matter?
- You just made a bet.
Something closing in on you, Pops?
This is my bet.
- Fifty on Winsome Lass to win.
- Danny, don't you remember?
You bet Godolphin $900 to win the Broxton Relay.
I bet... Come on, will ya?
I wouldn't bet on Godolphin to start with the letter "G."
Well, skipping all the-the technical language and getting down to the point, uh... l-I would say, if you'll ignore him, he'll go away.
And may I tell you something?
He's not so easy to ignore.
Oh, please try.
I know you can do it.
You know, Professor, sitting... sitting here with you like this...
I almost believe you're right.
- I will try.
- Bravo!
Now just say, "Farewell, Blackbeard.
Bother me no more."
Farewell, Blackbeard. Bother me no more.
I like the sound of that.
But just in case that it doesn't work, may I feel free to call on you at any time?
Somehow, you give me a feeling of security.
Oh. Well, certainly.
L... Well, there's no point in being the head of a committee... unless you intend to do your job properly.
- How true.
- Yeah.
Oh, no.
Sorry about the ice cream, madame.
Oh, it's quite all right... but, uh, I think I'll skip dessert.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, just the check, please.
- Here we are. Uh, keep the change.
- Thank you.
Shall we?
- Oh.
- Come along.
- Excuse me.
- Good night.
- Good night, madame.
- Good night now.
- Thank you.
Uh, good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.
- Good night.
- Good night.
How do you do, ladies and gentlemen?
Mel Willis here.
And welcome to Sports Spectacular... coming to you this week from Broxton Field... home of the famous national track and field event... the Broxton Invitational Relays.
Now, as you sports fans know... there are some four college teams represented here tonight.
At least three of these squads are numbered among the outstanding teams in the nation.
As for the fourth, little Godolphin
College from across the river...
Well, in the old days, the Godolphin track squad took a back seat to no one.
They had a great tradition.
But those good old days seem to be gone forever.
I want you to look at this event not as an ordinary track meet... but as a preparation for life.
Now, some of you are gonna be graduating soon.
You're gonna find the world out there full of nothing but trouble... frustration and... and strife.
And I tell you right now that nowhere will you find a better preparation... for that world outside than to be a member of this particular track team.
All right, it's time to go.
But I want you to know, no matter what happens out there tonight... in my heart, each and every one of you is a champion.
Let's go!
Oh, pardon me, Professor.
Oh, Jo Anne. Nice of you to come.
We can use all the good wishes we can get.
Well, I certainly do wish you and your team good luck.
- However, that is not why I'm here.
- Oh.
You may recall that, uh, last night
I placed the sum of $900 in my bag... and when I opened it this morning...
I found this in its place.
"$900 on Godolphin."
Jo Anne...
I appreciate the gesture of confidence, but you shouldn't have done it.
Mr Walker, in the first place,
I do not bet.
And in the second place, if I did,
I certainly would not embezzle funds... that have been placed in my trust to do it.
Well, then how did it happen?
Well, I believe you were the only person to know that I had that money in my purse.
It's that rotten pirate.
He did it!
Can you imagine, taking money meant for those little old ladies?
- Well, someone took it.
- Now I remember. Now l...
Your purse went off...
You don't think I did it, do you?
Well, you can't expect me to credit that story.
Well, Jo Anne, that's exactly what happened!
Besides, didn't you say you believed in the pirate?
Well, not $900 worth!
Besides, I believe in him as... as a-a metaphysical image... not some stupid, sticky-fingered goop.
Well, that's exactly what he is!
- Hurry up, Coach. It's beginning.
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.
- Mr. Walker, l-I shan't bother you any more.
I want you to know that I understand perfectly.
Your motives were good, even though your reasoning was perfectly idiotic!
With the captain and the bottle
You regard me strangely, son.
Something amiss?
- You took that money.
- Money? Money.
Oh, the odd flimsy I removed from the purse of your, uh, bookish wench.
Why should that stir your ire?
Because it belongs to the little old ladies!
Now, lookee here.
You know as well as I do I replaced that money with a piece of paper... what will bring great wealth to them small old ladies.
Money in fifty-fold!
Oh, I can't trust no one.
- I'll deal with this matter personally.
- Wait a minute.
Just how do you figure to do that?
By bringing a victory in this sport event... which is taking place out there this moment.
- Aha! I told you once to keep...
Give me that rubbing alcohol!
- Hey! Oh!
- That's a dangerous move, me hearty.
- That's not to drink, you idiot!
- What are you trying to do, kill yourself?
- Little late to think about that, isn't it?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Let's get one thing straight between you and me right now.
You're to keep your grubby paws off of my boys. You understand that?
I don't know what you're trying to do out there, but you are not gonna do it.
My team may not win out there, but whatever they do... they're gonna do it honestly.
Come on, Coach, will ya? We've come in last in two events already.
Hands off. You got that?
"Come on, Coach, will ya? We've come in last in two events already."
Another bean rake.
All right, play it whatever way you like, ya puppy.
Get no help from me.
You'll come crawlin' back, you will.
I'll bring my boot to you, and I'll grind your mealy-mouthed jib... into the dirt!
I will.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's going just about as I predicted.
Broxton has won the first three events, followed by Tidewater Tech and State... and lastly, little Godolphin College... which has not scored a single point... nor, in my humble opinion, seems likely to.
The discus throw. LJ Sewell of
Broxton College, the first contestant.
Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like a new meet record!
In the discus throw,
Sewell of Broxton College...
210 feet and 11 inches.
Now, you're gonna do fine, Bagwell.
Just remember to let go on the second turn, huh?
- Let go, second turn. Right, Coach.
- Okay.
Bagwell of Godolphin College ready on the discus throw.
Oh, how I dread this.
Let go!
Bagwell, let go of the discus!
- Bagwell of Godolphin College fouls.
- You know, Dean, this whole thing bugs me.
You take the profits made by my football boys, then go right out and blow it... on sweat socks and stuff for this crummy team.
- Excuse me.
- Would you be good enough to spare me your usual soliloquy on sweat socks?
Mr Seymour, may I speak with you for a moment, please?
Why, certainly, Professor, anytime.
Run along, fellas.
Now, Professor, what can I do for you?
Well, yesterday, uh...
I shan't explain how, but...
$900 belonging to the Daughters of the Buccaneers... was bet on Godolphin.
Say, now.
So the bet was all your doing, huh?
Well, l... I was wondering... if you would be kind enough to cancel the bet and give us back the money?
Professor, as you know,
I'm a man of principle.
And man and boy, my guiding principle has always been a bet's a bet.
But look at those poor old ladies.
What's gonna happen to them?
You know they have nowhere to go.
I've been thinking about those dear old girls... living in that drafty inn, working their fingers to the bone... living from hand to mouth... cluttering up that valuable piece of real estate.
Now, do they know about this?
Of course not.
I wouldn't dare raise false hopes.
Then you won't give it back?
Sweetness, what do you take me for?
Oh, Professor, you'd better hold onto this.
That may become very valuable someday.
I know your sort.
Ready for the start of the mile run.
Contestants will take their positions.
My great, great granddaughters.
By thunder!
There be a time for action!
Old ladies, Blackbeard's coming.
Up the Jolly Roger!
Well, let's see where we stand now.
The mile run is in its second lap.
Leading at the moment is Broxton.
Over at the high jump,
Shockley of Godolphin.
- What was that?
- Unusual jumping style there.
Hey, Coach, Shockley just cleared 6' 11 "!
- Our Shockley?
- And they're trying for seven feet!
Shockley of Godolphin jumping.
- He clears the bar at seven feet.
- Great stuff, Coach.
Where did you find him?
Well, we never know, do we?
It only proves that nothing is certain in the world of... Just a moment.
Here's the final lap of the mile run coming around now.
- Where did you find him, Coach?
- Get out of there! Excuse me.
- You idiot! Get off the track!
- What's going on over here?
Hey, fella, come back here!
I don't need these, of course, but just for a moment there... it looked as though they were running backward.
- Come on back!
- They are.
Keep going! Keep going!
Come join the mollies dance, lad!
'Twill raise your reedy spirits.
I'm telling you to get off this field... right now!
If you ask me, he makes a better pom-pom girl than he does a coach.
It's Chulay of Godolphin, ready with thejavelin throw.
- Stop! Stop!
- Where do you think you're going, Coach?
270 feet, 4 inches for Chulay of Godolphin.
The shot put event. Wilkins of
Broxton College, the first contestant.
What do you mean, you want to enter a protest? Didn't you win those last three events?
That's just the point.
It wasn't us, it was...
Look. Now, look. Look.
He's at it again.
Okay, I'm looking.
Wilkins, a little off form tonight.
That comes to 5 feet, 11 inches.
Now, did you see that?
Okay, he flubbed one.
What's the big problem?
And now, Gudger Larkin of Godolphin is ready with his effort.
It's really not much of a...
It seems to be coming this way.
Impossible.
72 feet, 3 inches... a new shot put record for Larkin.
Excuse me, but I have to see some sweet old ladies about a bet.
Godolphin to win?
Have you gone out of your mind?
Not yet, but the evening's still young.
Mr Seymour!
- Why don't you stop your babbling and get out of here?
- Well, if you'd just listen to what I have to say.
- We're under pressure too!
- The pole vault bar is set at 17 feet, 5 inches.
First contestant,
Carson of Broxton College.
- I knew he'd go too far!
- Nail him!
Mr. Walker, one more disturbance, you'll be ruled off the field entirely.
- Now, is that clear?
- Second contestant on the pole vault.
Neilson of Godolphin College... sets a new record of 17 feet,
5 inches in the pole vault.
- Go, Godolphin, go!
- I never saw you get this excited at a football game.
Yea, Godolphin!
May I tell you something, Mr Purvis?
Yea, Godolphin! Go!
I hate football.
Yea, Godolphin! I've always hated football! Go, go, go!
Well, lad, what do you think of your old matey now, eh?
They could hang me for what I think of you know! Didn't I tell you... to keep your hands off of my boys?
Oh, you do, do you?
Well, let me simply say you are the lowest, most underhanded... miserable excuse for what used to be a human being that's ever been my misfortune... to be in any shape, way or form connected with!
- I thought I was helping you.
- Helping? Well, that's a yuck for ya!
Didn't you say yourself that if
I helped them old ladies... that that would contribute towards me own salvation?
You haven't helped them.
You haven't helped anybody.
Haven't helped anybody?
I perceive now how difficult it is... to do a good deed in this dirty world.
Just go away. Just go away.
Just get out of my life.
- No, no, no.
- You mean nothing but trouble.
You mean... I can see now... why the very mention of your name used to give everybody the creeps.
Well, I'm gonna find a comfortable place.
I'm gonna rest there, somewhere.
- And I'm gonna stay out of your affairs.
- Great, great.
That's the best news I've had in years.
Go disappear yourself.
I'm gonna disappear myself, that's what I'm gonna do.
Mr Sanctimonious Scupperlout!
Sink me if I raise so much as a finger to help you in the future.
I'd rather spend a winter of eternities in limbo... than knock knees a tick longer... with a nit like you.
- There, I've said it.
- The final event of the evening, the relay races, are about to begin.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I had to do that. You see what he's trying to do, don't you? Hmm?
Well, the rotten pirate wants to make me as-as crooked as he is.
Well, I don't buy it.
I'm standing on my principles.
Why, sure, Coach. Where'd any of us be without our principles?
You betcha.
You betcha.
Tiny Godolphin College, perennial underdog for two decades... has come back with the biggest bang you've ever seen.
Coach Walker of Godolphin, the man of the hour.
Throwing in an attack of dazzling new techniques... his inspired team of star performers... has slashed its way up into a tie with Broxton.
Now victory hangs in the balance as we come to the final event of the evening.
The question... What is going to happen as Godolphin faces...
Broxton's mighty relay team?
Gentlemen, take your marks.
Set.
Come on, Broxton!
Run, you punk!
Go, Godolphin! Come on, team!
Come on, team! Yea!
At we come to the end of the first lap in this crucial race... the first three runners are closely bunched.
Now they pass the baton for the start of the second lap.
It's Broxton first,
Tidewater second, State third...
Yes, and there's the Godolphin man, labouring along in the rear.
Easy now, Coach.
You're tensing up again.
Maybe I shouldn't have yelled at him that way.
I mean, how's a poor, dumb pirate supposed to know what principles are, huh?
But I do. I've gotta shave this face every morning.
- I know, Coach. I shave too.
- You bet you do.
You gotta look at yourself.
You've gotta live with yourself.
- I gotta go with my principles.
- Sure, Coach. You do that.
- I will, I will.
Well, folks, it's just about all over but the shouting.
Middle of the second lap, Broxton is already half a lap ahead of Godolphin.
Do we win something for fourth place?
I'm afraid not.
You see those little old ladies up there?
Well, I'm gonna let those little old ladies get tossed right out on their ear.
- How's that for a principle?
- Well...
Beginning the third lap,
Broxton is in first place... followed in order by Tidewater,
State and Godolphin.
Who says you can't win 'em all?
Come on. Let's get out of this folk festival.
Look at Silky and his boys.
All they wanna do is squeeze every loose nickel out of this county.
Well, just because I have a chance to cut their water off doesn't mean...
I have to get mixed up in it, does it?
Well, don't just sit there now, you coldhearted creep!
Yes, you! Get up!
Do something!
Oh, don't give me that!
I know you can hear me!
What are you going to do about them?
Your own kith and kin! So, Bob, you gonna let 'em get pushed around because of my principles?
Don't you have any pride?
Come on! You started it.
Finish it.
Come on! Move it!
Someday I'm gonna strangle him.
Come on! Hurry!
- Pour it on!
- Hurry up!
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!
As we approach the last lap,
Dewey of Broxton is well in the lead.
He passes the baton to...
No, he didn't.
He still has it.
The Broxton anchor man is running the last lap... with a hot dog?
Tidewater makes their pass.
State makes their pass, and...
I believe, yes... the State anchor man seems to have a bottle of...
The Godolphin man, who was half a lap behind, approaches the passing zone.
Come on, Godolphin!
- Come on!
- Ahoy, there!
A perfect change! Friends,
Gudger Larkin of Godolphin... is the only one of the four anchor men to have completed a clean pass.
Now he streaks past the other contestants... who are on their way back to retrieve their batons!
We seem to have a slight hang-up in the passing zone.
Dewey of State has got a hold of
Broxton's baton. Let's check that.
No, it's the hot dog.
Carver of Broxton... a real head's-up performer, has got a hold of two batons.
No! One is snatched away by Wilson of Tidewater!
Come on, Broxton, stop foolin' around!
Gudger Larkin has taken advantage of the rhubarb... and has forged almost a third of a lap ahead of the field.
Catch 'em! Catch 'em!
- Come on!
- Gudger Larkin of Godolphin is still in front... but he's beginning to run out of gas and the others are hot on his heels!
Stop him! Stop him!
Not that, you meathead!
Go, Godolphin, go!
Get up. Get up!
Get up, Gudger!
Get up!
A one-of-a-kind relay team.
Get away from me, you old bats!
We-We won! We won all 45,000 lovely smackeroos! We won!
Technically, maybe we won, but actually...
- You did it, boy! You did it!
Brilliant work!
- Sir, I think when you hear what I have to say...
Say? What is there to say?
The scoreboard says it all!
We thank you, we thank you, we thank you, we thank you!
No rough stuff, old ladies.
You be nice to him.
- Miss Stowecroft?
- Oh, Professor, we're so happy.
Mr Ainsworth from the bank is coming over, and you can give him the money.
And at the stroke of midnight, we'd like Mr Walker to have the honour of burning the mortgage.
- He's done so much for us.
- Well, where is Mr Walker, who's done so much for us?
Well, I believe he's up in his room.
- Is anything wrong?
- Excuse me.
But why go now?
I mean, the lads have triumphed.
The wager's won.
Your wench is happy.
There's enough money set aside for the old ladies.
I fail to divine your reason for leaving.
- Well, don't strain your brain.
- Furthermore, when the mortgage... is consigned to the flames tonight, there is a very good chance... the horrible curse may be lifted off my good self... in which case you may be able to settle down to a serene... albeit somewhat dull... life without me.
Look, frizzface, you think I can stay around here... after what happened out there tonight?
What am I supposed to do for an encore?
No, I'm bailing out.
I've got to go somewhere...
I can make a fresh start... honestly, this time.
Very well.
It be no concern of mine.
I just think it may be a little early for you to be striking your colours!
Stri... Come in!
Oh. Hi.
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
After taking my money and-and stirring everything up... you're running off and leaving us in a lurch?
- No, you don't!
- What are you squawking about?
You got it back, didn't you?
No, I didn't.
Silky welshed on the bet.
- He what?
- Well, he...
He just laughed and said he wasn't gonna pay off.
He's throwing Miss Stowecroft and the others out first thing in the morning.
Under normal conditions, if I can remember such a time...
I have a sweet and a loveable nature.
- Well, you-you know what I think?
- If I may proffer a suggestion...
Shut up!
Both of you!
- Both of who?
- I am sick and tired... of people thinking and suggesting and giving me a lot of cheap advice.
What I am gonna do,
I am gonna find that happy hoodlum... and I am gonna wring that money out of his crooked little neck!
- Steve-Steve, you can't, not in your condition.
- What condition?
Well, anyone can see you're hallucinating again.
Steve, you can't fight
Silky and his men.
She's right, son.
This be a job what takes innards.
Innards? Oh, well, you just sit here and contemplate yours.
- I've got a job to do.
- Permission to come with you, sir?
Oh, no, buddy boy.
No more of your big ideas.
- I'm calling the shots this time.
- Proud to serve under you, sir.
You mean that?
My word, sir, is the ultimate warranty.
All right, shipmate, let's go!
- Make ready the boarding party, Captain.
- Thank ye, Admiral.
Cutlass. You might need that.
Uh-huh. What?
Oh, it's on the bed.
Oh, Steve.
You really have flipped.
Beat, two quarters, drummer boy.
Come cheer up, my lads
'Tis to glory we steer
With heads bearing high
We will banish all fear
To honour we call
You are free men, not slaves
- Free men!
- For who are more free than the sons of the waves
Hearts of oak are our ships
Jolly tars are our men
Eyes right!
We'll always be ready
- Steady, boys, steady
- Steady!
- We'll fight and we'll conquer
- We'll conquer!
Again and again
Together now!
- Hearts of oak are our ships
Jolly tars are our men
- Steve!
- We'll always be ready
Steady, boys, steady
- Steve, wait!
I'm not letting you go to that place alone.
Hearts of oak are our ships
Jolly tars are our men
We'll always be ready
Steady, boys, steady
We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again
Once more, lad.
Sing out. Don't mumble!
Come cheer up, my lads
'Tis to glory we steer
With heads bearing high we will banish all fear
- Steve, wait!
- To honour we call
You are free men, not slaves
For who are so free as the sons of the waves
Hearts of oak are our ships
Jolly tars are our men
We'll always be ready
Steady, boys, steady
We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again
- Oh, you again?
- We'd like to see Mr Seymour.
Look, sister, I'm telling you once and for all...
Mr Seymour don't wanna see...
Come on.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Now, what can I do for you?
We're here to collect the money you owe Professor Baker.
The money I owe her?
You gotta be kidding.
Mr Seymour, you're gonna pay every cent of that money, or l...
Or what, Mr Walker?
Or we might have to get tough.
Now, do I get some action, or don't I?
Mr Walker, I have got to admire your style.
I really do.
I'll tell you what.
You know, there's no use beating up a guy who's the town hero tonight.
It's bad for my image.
You know what I mean?
Professor... here's the $900 you put down on the bet.
- Go ahead, take it.
- Oh, no!
You know very well we need the full amount you rightfully owe us.
Professor, let me level with you.
If I pay you back all that loot, then you'll give it to the old ladies... who'll pay back the bank, right?
And bingo, there goes my childhood dream... namely, running one of those class gambling joints... like they have out west.
I'm sorry, no dice.
But I'll tell you what.
We have a very nice roulette wheel here.
Why don't you forget this phony bet?
Take the $900. Go out there and win some money honestly.
I'll guarantee you, sweetie, you'll sleep a lot better tonight.
Mr Seymour, come up with the full amount, or I'm gonna take this place apart.
- Yeah?
- You have exactly 15 seconds... What?
I said, take the money, lad.
Let the wench try her luck.
Let her what?
Suppose she loses?
You sure it'll work?
- Okay. We'll take it.
- What? We most certainly will not take it!
Mr Seymour has made a very meritorious suggestion.
You know, Mr Walker,
I do not understand you.
One minute, you are a-a-a knight in shining armour.
- And the next minute, you are a...
- Well, we all make mistakes, right, Mr Seymour?
Mr Walker, it's a smart man who knows when to crawfish.
Come along. I'll show you to a nice, quiet room... reserved for our more valued-type customers.
- But I don't know how to gamble.
- This is a good place to learn.
Harry, these are friends of mine.
Take good care of them, will ya?
- Okay, Mr Seymour.
- Good luck, folks.
- Uh, $900 worth, please.
- Yes, sir.
Now, don't worry about a thing.
Just let me handle this.
I'll take the chips, please.
Yellows are a dollar... the reds are five... the blues are 25, the whites 100.
- Don't you have any 50-cent chips?
- Not in this room, lady.
- Make your bets, please.
- It's 28 minutes to midnight.
Now hurry up.
- Oh! Oh, 29 is a good number.
- No, no, no, no. Bet 'em all.
- We don't have time to fool around.
- Mr Walker, are you trying to lose my $900 from me again?
No more bets, please.
The number is 31.
Oh, that's not my numb...
- Oh, how nice.
- Make your bets, please.
Ride, ride. Let it ride.
Let the whole thing ride.
- Oh.
- No, no.
You can't win that way.
Put it on one number.
Would you please just let me do it my way?
No more bets, please.
Number 32. And we ha...
And we have $36 on number 32?
- I won! I won! I told you
I had a talent for this.
- Okay, okay.
- Pay me! Pay me!
- 35 times 36...
Evening, folks.
- What goes on here?
- You tell me.
We're doing fine. We're doing just great. Now let's see.
- Let's put 'em all on...
- No, no. Don't tell me! Let me do it!
- No, let me try one!
- Steve, have you ever played this game before?
- No, but I can tell ya...
Then leave my chips alone, because I have a system.
- A system? What system?
- Woman's intuition. That's what.
- Will you put 'em all on one number.
- No! Steve!
- All right?
Don't you understand?
Time's running out.
Spin the wheel, please.
Watch the board. Whatever happens, watch those chips on the board.
One more like that and we're home.
35 times 36...
Well, now we let it ride.
- Don't fool with it any more.
Go to the gaff.
- Gotcha.
- Would you spin the wheel, please?
- Yes, ma'am.
Everything rides on number 20.
Oh! Oh!
Oh, we did it! We did it!
- What?
- Number 15.
So very sorry, ma'am.
You know what I think?
I think this is a stupid game.
I don't understand.
Something must have gone wrong.
I'll say something went wrong.
We lost almost everything.
All right. Don't panic.
Relax, relax.
We've still got half of the chips we won the first time.
Scurvy cheat.
Look, put 'em all down.
Put all the chips down.
If we put all the chips we've got left onto one number... and it comes up...
- Yeah. We're still in business.
- Make your bets, please.
- The only question is...
- The only question is, what if it doesn't come up?
Don't worry.
Everything is go, all on 11.
- Steve, that's all we have!
- No more bets, please.
Everything goes on 11.
Relax.
We did it! We did it!
- We won! We won!
- Yeah, we did great.
Now, come on. We got enough.
Enough? Enough? What? Are you out of your mind? We're on a winning streak!
Think of those dear old ladies!
Think of what we could buy them.
We could buy them warm coats and cars and polo ponies.
Are you kidding? We gotta get out of here. We barely have time to make it.
- Hey, pay up, will you?
- Wait. Let me place one-one more.
- Pay up. We're in a very big hurry.
- A small bet. $ 100? Maybe 20... 25?
- Hey, fella. Hey.
- A dollar. A dollar.
Pay up, yes.
- That's enough.
- We thank you, the Daughters of the
Buccaneers thank you, and good night.
- Enough?
- Let's go.
- There's still more. Maybe we should take it for good luck.
Not yet.
I just put down a new carpet.
- I hear you've done very well.
- Not bad.
May I see?
Please.
My, my.
That's very nice, indeed.
I'm very happy for you.
See? You made out all right.
You took Silky's advice, right?
Now, why don't you take Silky's advice again and let me keep this for you?
- No, you don't.
- You know, this is an awful lot of bread... for you to be carrying around here, honey.
This is a very dangerous neighbourhood.
Okay, Professor, give me the bag.
I've been very patient with both of you and very civilized.
Okay, boys.
Go on over there, Jo Anne.
Go on.
Make with the muscle.
All right, boys, make your play.
Missed me.
What's the matter with you?
Get up and get him!
And now for Mr Seymour.
- Steve!
- Get his guns!
Get-Get the gun!
- Steve!
- Shoot him! Shoot him!
- I shot him.
- Don't point that thing over here!
- All ashore what's going ashore!
- Come on!
Steve!
Oh, quite nice, lad, yes.
- There's a boat down here. Come on.
- Proceed, lad. I'll just tidy up bit.
Have fun.
Help! Help!
Come on. Stop fooling around!
Get him any way you can!
Got any idea who we're fighting?
It ain't "who' I'm worried about, it's "what."
Are we winning, Mr Seymour?
- Who-Who's that?
- It's me, stupid.
- It's around here someplace.
- Yeah, well, if you think that thing scares me...
Stop 'em! Stop...
Can't you give us just a little more time?
I'm very sorry, ladies, but I'm always precise in these matters.
According to the terms of this document... unless you produce the required payment at midnight of this date... which is just
11 seconds from now...
Eight, seven... six...
Thank you, Mr Ainsworth.
It's a pleasure to do business with you.
Mr Walker, this is the moment that most of us... have been waiting for all our lives.
Will you burn the mortgage?
Miss Stowecroft, thank you very much, but that honour's not for me. L...
Knock their heads together
Here comes the fella you really should thank.
A green-eyed maiden too
And a green-eyed maiden too
Knock them in the head and drop them in the river
With a green-eyed maiden and a...
Oh, no, she said
Oh, yes, I said
Oh, no, you don't again
She said
Hello, old buddy.
I'm glad to see you.
Ladies, all of you repeat after me, please. You too.
Allow me to present your real benefactor.
Captain Blackbeard!
My respects, ma'am.
Good ladies, your welcome has touched me deeply.
Loathe as I am to play the gallant...
I am bound to say... that I've never beheld a concourse of fair creatures... which has stirred me more.
Oh, yes. Thank ye for your esteem.
Thank ye.
And yet you cannot know what it has been like for a person of my disposition... to have been still of tongue, to have had no one to talk to... for 200 accursed and dusty years.
Yet now, my voice is heard once again.
Oh, I do thank you.
Yet stay.
It is not my wish... as a person... as generous as my good self... to seek to take the lion's share of the glory.
No, no.
Oh, no.
This young... rooster, my good friend... he played a modest part... in your delivery from disaster.
- Well, I'd only...
- Not now, son.
Our heart is too full to hear more.
Now, if I might have that vile document.
Aldetha... the time is here.
I go now... to a distant... and I hope, hospitable shore.
I beg of you... take notice of this.
I, Edward Teach, captain... affectionately known... as Blackbeard... was not all bad.
Look after this boy.
He needs help.
Fare thee well, lad.
- Good-bye, Captain.
- We will not meet again.
Beware all wenches.
For he's a jolly good fellow
He's a jolly good fellow
He's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Share this one amongst you, me beauties.
You know something? I think
I'm gonna miss the old scoundrel.
You know something?
I loved you even when
I thought you were nuts.
Look!
- Captain, proud to see you again, sir.
- Where have you been?
You're a sight for sore eyes, you are, sir. Where are we off to now?
Now, you lazy swabs, stir yourselves!
Lift anchor.
Shake out the main.
Lively now, or I'll carve your gizzard... and fry it for me supper!
the day of the dead is celebrated in
Mexico in a unique way, because...
...Mexicans have a rooted sense of the dead. they make toys, bread and sugar
...skulls. they place an offering at their homes with flowers... and food, so they can eat and drink. the worship of the dead...
...comes from the natives, but during the 16th and 17th...
...centuries, their customs and believes were mixed with those...
...of christianity, so their rites and practices are a combination of...
...both cultures up to this day.
MACARIO
For whom is that candle?
For your goodmother, Rosa.
May she rest in peace.
She was always very kind with us.
And there won't be a candle for my dad?
No, my child. thanks God your father is alive. this is only for the dead.
At Mr. Narciso's they're mounting a big offering...
As usual... they're so pretentious, even with the dead...
..we aren't. this is what we eat, this is what our dead eat.
Are you back, Macario?
Yes, I'm back.
Please give these flower to your woman, for your offering. thank you.
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day, Macario. dad is coming!
What did you bring to us?
Later, later.
I brought nice things. children, what are you doing? dad, dad!
- Give me one, give me one.
- Easy, easy...
I brought lots of things for everybody. the baby first. there you are.
Me, me.
- A little bird.
- It's so nice!
- Is it to eat?
- Not at all.
Look, it's so nice.
Our Father, who art in heaven, we thank you...
...for our food today. May we have it tomorrow.
In the name of the Father...
...and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
I have finished, mom. that's not true. His mouth is full yet!
I want more.
- I want more.
- So do l. can I have more?
- Me too.
- Give me more.
- Please give some more?
Eh, look! come here, it's so beautiful!
Lots of food! the dead are going to eat everything?
If I die, can I come to eat here?
No, only rich dead people eat here.
Ours eat at our offering. then, I'd better not come!
Mom, can we go out to see the market?
Yes my children, you can go, but behave...
...I'll be with you in a moment.
Mom, if they don't behave, can I beat them?
No, you can't.
Good morning, chona.
Good morning. It's 3 real.
And why is that much? they sent many lace shirts from
Mr. Ramiro. It's more expensive.
You always find a way to overcharge.
We'll hear Mme. Eulalia.
Hey, tell her not to forget my dead's tip.
Mme. Eulalia was saying that dead people are not pretext for money.
Ask her anyway.
- Good morning.
- Hi Macario. come in, the sir is here.
How do you do, Macario?
Wait a moment.
Because dead is giving us a lot of work today.
So many candles, uh?
And you see, they're not enough for today. dead are more than these.
Aren't you going to buy yours? they're cheaper for you.
No, thank you. that's too bad,
Macario.
We've got to be nicer with the dead...
...because we spend more time dead than alive.
Anyway, we all are born to die.
What do we earn here?
A bust, and sometimes, no even that.
Lots of work...
...many troubles.
When we're born, we're carrying our death in the liver...
...or in the stomach...
...or here...
...in the heart, that one day will beat no more.
It can also be outside...
...sitting under a tree...
...that hasn't grown yet...
...but that will fall on you when you're old.
When we're born, we're carrying our death in the liver...
...or in the stomach...
...or here, in the heart...
...that one day will beat no more.
It can also be outside...
...sitting under a tree...
...that hasn 't grown yet...
...but that will fall on you when you're old. dad, look at my skull. dad, I also want one. can you buy me the big one?
I also want one, dad.
I want many!
I will buy them for you. they gave me my dead's tip.
Wait for me at the cloister. I'm going to deliver the firewood.
I prefer a sponge cake.
- I want this one.
- I prefer this one.
- You want to many things.
- I prefer this one. choose whatever you want.
- Good morning.
- How do you do, Macario?
Hey, Mr. Alfredo...
...it's very late and I haven't got my bread yet!
My dead are waiting since very early.
It's delayed, please excuse us.
But here we have a very special order from Mr. Ramiro.
Bet not from Mr. Ramiro!
He's got his own oven, so he has tasty home bread.
But his oven draws bad...
...so he brought six turkeys to be cooked.
He has important guests.
So my bread won't be ready!
It'll be ready later. Honest.
O.K.
What do you think of our turkeys, my friend?
Our? Are they yours too?
You'll see...
...those of us working with Mr.
Ramiro, eat the same as him.
We have very important guests today. dou you know who's coming? canon cristino
Alatriste.
Who is that one?
Everybody knows him!
He's...er..
Be careful, you're going to throw the juice.
Get it in!
Are going to give us the wood for free?
What happens to him? He didn't even ask for a dead's tip.
Be careful!
Be very careful not to drop them because you'll have to pay. don't finish them. Leave me one. Leave one for me!
What happens, Macario?
Nothing. Go back to sleep.
Macario...
Macario, won't you eat anything?
Kids have already eaten your part.
But I reserved just a little when
I noticed you weren't having lunch.
If you don't go, they'll eat it as well.
Let them eat it!
Aren't you hungry?
Hungry?
Hungry?
It's the way I've been all my life.
Like you. Like my children.
My only thought were to eat.
We've been starving all of our lives.
You saw those turkeys yesterday.
I won't be starving slowly anymore.
I'm going to die at once.
I won't eat anything until I can...
...eat a turkey by myself.
...without sharing it.
Not staying hungry to let others eat.
Although the others...
...be my children.
I want to eat by myself.
All for me...
All of it, and if not,
I will never eat.
I want to be full...
...not hungry...
...with the turkey's flavor in my mouth...
...not wanting another piece.
Give the kids what you reserved for me...
...because I'll never eat again.
Here you are,
Macario come on Macario. take it.
Give it to the children.
- First me.
- Me! the younger first.
You wait here.
Hasn't chona told you that I like skirts?
Look at this! this is impossible!
I ran out of starch....
...and at the moment I had no money to buy more. don't expect to pay for them like this. take them away and bring them back properly.
Mariquita, the last one...
...will go and see...
...if they live or die, to run away!
She's dead!
Run!
Mariquita, the last one...
...will go and see...
...if they live or die, to run away!
He's warm.
You turn around, and run this way...
...and you see Milano eating parsley...
...he's not here, he's in his place...
...the rose is coming up and the carnation is fading away...
She's dead!
Macario! take this.
You said you wanted just for yourself.
I understand, Macario.
I have also wanted something for myself.
So I won't need to share it.
Not even with you.
But go away right now.
Because if the children see it, they will want their part, won't they? come on... come on, Macario... take it now.
Hey friend... the turkey you're about to eat looks so good.
Are you going to invite me?
I'm not your friend.
And I'm not going to share it.
Hey my friend...
...that animal looks so tasty...
Let's make a deal.
If you give me one leg, nothing else...
...I'll give you my silver spurs.
What do I want a spur for?
I don't have a horse.
Well...
...I can give you some other thing... can you see the buttons on my trousers? they are made of gold.
If you give me a slice of the breast...
...just a slice of the breast...
I'll give you these coins.
And what am I going to do with them?
If I went to exchange them, they'd cut my hand for thief.
A guy like me doesn't pay with gold coins.
Go away, leave me alone!
Well Macario, this deal is going to be a lot better.
If you give me a wing...
...just a single wing...
I'll give you this whole forest.
All these trees will be yours...
...What do you say?
What would I gain if
I were the owner?
I'd have to cut, carry and sell the wood, as I do today.
Besides, you cannot give me this forest, because it's not yours...
It's from God, our Lord.
Hey man, do some charity for me.
You, sir...
...want a piece?...
Just a bite...
...if you want to share it.
Why sir?
Why?
You're not interested on this bite.
You're interested in a gesture...
...an action...
...you know that I hadn't wanted anything for me alone in my whole life. then this desire...
...for you is a dead animal.
It's just an excuse to behave well.
It's everything for me.
All the hunger of my life.
All that I have given. All that I haven't received.
Forgive me.
I know that you can forgive me if you want.
I don't want to share it with you. I don't want to.
But if you really want a bite...
Friend, all that turkey is just for you?
I'm very hungry.
I've been hungry for quite a long time.
It's been thousands of years since I last ate. can you share a bite with me?
I knew that this couldn't be true...
It was too much to ask.
I'm going to share it with you.
I'm going to cut it in the middle.
Pick the one that you prefer. thank you very much.
Some water?
No, thanks.
Very tasty!
I can say that your wife cooks great. does it bug you if we talk?
I speak so rarely to men.
Rarely.
We meet an instant and there's really nothing to say nor time to spend... can I ask you something?
Why did you invite me?
Because you were very hungry.
It was quite clear.
More than l, ever. that's why you invited me?
Well, yes.
Mainly because of that.
And the first one who asked you...
Why didn't you invite him? that one? Of course not!
He wanted to fool me.
Above all, if I didn't invite my children nor my wife. do you think that some spurs or some coins...
...worth more than my family's satisfaction?
But, you know...
...the second one?
Why didn't you invite him?
He's the owner of everything that exists...
...of you...of everything.
He only wanted a gesture from me.
After inviting him, I'd have run full of repentance...
...to invite my family, and
I had eaten almost nothing.
And to me, why did you invite me?
You said that mainly because of my hunger...
...or is it there any other reason? the truth...
...when I saw you I thought I wouldn't have time even for a bite.
When you show yourself, there's no time for anything. then I estimate that if I gave you a half and we ate at the same time...
...while you ate, I'd ate too.
You have invited me...
I've been in the company of you...
...and I have even laughed a little.
So I'm indebted to you and
I'm going to reward you.
I'm going to pay for your invitation at such a price as you never dreamed of.
Now empty you container.
Give it to me.
Macario, this water can cure any illness.
As long as I have no reason to impede the health of the sick.
I give it to you.
And think that no man has got the power I deliver in your hands.
Watch the way you use it.
If you visit a sick man, I'll always be by his side.
When I'd be at the foot of his bed, give him a drop.
A single drop of the water I'm giving you.
Because that'll be enough to cure him.
But if I'm at the top end... try nothing. He'll die.
You don't believe me, do you?
It's all right.
I'll make that very soon... today, you'll have the chance to believe me. today?
And be careful. don't spill a single drop, because
I'll never give you more.
And remember...
If you see me at the foot of the sick...
...with a drop you'll give him health.
...and if I'm at the top end... try nothing. that person belongs to me.
See you later, Macario.
We may not talk again, but we'll see us often.
And remember.
Use my gift wisely.
And be worthy of my friendship. there he is!
Oh my God, he's cold. touch him!
Please cover him!
- He's already cold. Save him please.
- Oh my God.
My son...
Son.
My son...
I saw him walking straight.
As if he were conducted. and although I shouted, and ran...
Poor mother.
My son. talk to me son. talk to me. talk to me.
We ought to get vulture broth...
...it's very good for this!
No way! that's only good for rabies.
Macario's coming!
- Parents can predict things.
- Yes, of course.
He'll be able to close his eyes.
Yes. Oh my God.
- dad!
- dad!
My brother fell on the pit
Go out!
- I told you to go out!
- No Macario!
Leave me alone with him!
Wait for me outside.
Please don't move.
Stay there.
Mom, my dad's back!
Are you going to serve the food?
Waait for me at the cloister. I'm going to deliver the firewood to the bakery.
So here's the woman of the healer. they have told me. things that people make up.
When there's a gossip...
Is it true that he only touched him and he cured him? there are people that have those gifts.
But I haven't met any of them. tell your husband to cure
Mme. Eulalia. She's so ill.
She doesn't even shout nor tell off.
She's really sick.
I'll bring you the dirty clothes in a moment.
Macario, now we know that you have healing gifts... tell me, is it true that you cured your son?
- things people tell.
- But why do they tell them? there's all the wood.
You keep to yourself, don't you?...
Mother, if you save Eulalia...
...I promise you a gold medal.
And look, well...
I promise you the medal...
...and a little gold crown, a little one, for your son...
...but save her.
In the name of the Father...
Macario, someone's coming.
You're Macario, aren't you?
- to serve God.
- do you know me?
- You're Mr. Ramiro.
- I'm rich, Macario.
My wife is ill. I don't believe stories, but the doctor has done all he could...
My wife is covered with suckers...
...a hundred leeches sucked her blood, but she stays the same. they say you can cure and
I don't believe it.
Is it true that you can cure?
It is true that I can sometimes cure... come with me to see her...
If you cure her, I'm going to give you whatever you want.
O.K. Wait for me there.
I need to be alone with her, Mr. Ramiro.
Alone?
It's the only way that
I can do something.
I have to object as a doctor that this man obstructs the work of science.
Please doctor, come this way.
Mr. Ramiro!
I can cure your wife.
How much are you going to charge me?
How much do you think her life worth?
Well...
...I'll give you...
...I'll give you... ten gold ounces. that's the value of her life for you?
I pay one ounce to the doctor.
But I'm going to cure her.
And how much do you want?
I want...
One hundred ounces.
One hundred ounces!
It's all right.
I'll give them to you.
But when she's completely cured. do you hear me?
What time is it?
It's..It's the dawn, sweet heart.
Why are you awake?
I'm very sleepy.
You cured her!
I told you I would.
Well...
I've got to pay. Of course.
We've said...
...it was pretty expensive...
Give me ten ounces. that'll be enough.
I don't want your enmity, but your gratitude. take it. Here's your money.
What are you doing, my husband?
You haven't slept all night long.
I'm planning business.
Hey...do you remember who else is sick among our friends?...
...besides the ones
I'm going to name...
Mr. Manuel centeno de la Barrera,
Mr. Josè Luis torres Salazar....
...count Francisco de Valderrama.
Our Father, who art in heaven...
...thank you very much for our food today.
May we have it tomorrow...
...the same!
In the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
How nice to see you.
Please come in...
I hope your father is not seriously ill.
He's not my father. He's my grandfather. He feels very ill.
But...
...you think he can be cured, of course.
You praised your doctor so much that...
Yes, but there's a limit.
Of course, it is possible.
Let's get him in. thank you.
Boys!
Be careful.
He took my job away, and now you have it!
What is his size?
He needs to be alone.
Please.
What are you doing here? Who are you?
Who the hell has got me in here?
Why isn't here anyone from my house?
Where the hell is everybody?
Why do you look at me with such a stupid face?
Get out of here! Get out right away!
MAcARlO dO HlS BUSlNESS HERE. dON RAMlRO'S GUEStHOUSE.
Ladies and gentlemen, open your eyes...
...and listen carefully
...pain, discomfort and groans are over...
...discomfort and groan....
... they come quickly in carriages...
...because everybody is in a rush...
...if they want a place to be cured by Macario...
... to be cured by Macario.
He 's cured many rich people, but at God's willing...
...money worth nothing....
...rich people also die, rich people also die.
Thhe doctor and the carpenter win...
Thhe widow cries afflicted, she 's going to lose all her money...
...she 's going to lose all her money.
Macario doesn 't allow it, because he 's an honest man...
He gives it back to the widow, and it's well done
...it's well done.
Look at Macario's wealth.
He's won my boss.
Well, not that much, but you can see the change.
How much would he paid?
Of course, he cures only rich people! that's not true. Macario cures everybody.
And he charges whatever they want to pay. My grandfather had only a pig...
-...and that's all he paid.
- that's true...
...I gave him only a dozen eggs...
I would have given him the hen, but he didn't want her.
He accepted my goat. I didn't have another, and he ate it in barbecue.
But you can see
I'm good as new!
Not that new! thank you boys. the one in the corner.
So Macario cures miraculously.
He's a sorcerer, isn't he?
He's not a sorcerer.
It happens that Holy
Virgin guides him...
...tells him how to cure.
No Virgin at all. It's the archangel Gabriel.
You think Holy Virgin would bother to come? that's what archangels are for...to help her.
I haven't smell incense when Macario passes by.
Furthermore, the opposite.
And what's the smell? Sulphur?
He smells like a person, like sweat.
Very funny, isn't it?
- the last rites.
- the extreme unction.
Who is going to die? those rites are for an old lady that came ill yesterday.
But Macario has already told her that she's a hopeless case.
So he also knows who's going to die and who doesn't.
He does.
- He's very wise, isn't he?
- Fortune-teller!
- Who are those men in black?
- they've been sent by the Holy Office. the lnquisition!
Mon, mom!
She's not here. Let's go!
Mom, mom.... dad, dad! dad, dad... dad... this is abundance.
So many things!
You've been thinking well, very well...
You've got to have a stock.
I didn't think about it. It was Macario.
Very well done. Well done.
You never know, and since
God is helping you.
Yes. I hope it's God.
Of course it's God. Who else?
Mom, mom!
I'm here.
Mom, we didn't find my dad, nor anybody. Help us find him.
Yes children.
Let's go.
- I'll be back soon, chona.
- Go on, don't worry about me.
I prefer the other house because we didn't get lost there.
Where are you, my woman!
- Where is everybody?
- Here.
- Why do you hide?
- We don't hide, we got lost. dad, dad! take it. I'm going to see the sick.
I'm so afraid! Let's go with mom!
- I'm afraid.
- We'd better go with mom and dad.
Let's go.
Mom, I'm so afraid!
Mom!
I'm not opposed that you arrest him and take him to the city.
But Macario has brought wealth and health to town...
...there will be a riot to defend him!
We can wait and ask for forces.
How big can that riot be? the whole town!
It may be the whole country, we'd crush it!
Beating and killing people?
It seems that you don't agree the Holy Office.
No, no, never...
It's only that he's just been accused, and he can be innocent. that man out of hell is guilty with no doubt.
Out of hell? Maybe...
But the church never had so many candles...
...and alms as today.
Well, if you need to arrest him, it would be wise to do it in secret. catch him carefully, by surprise, to avoid a slaughter.
Wife!
Wife!
Keep this.
But keep it safe.
What is it?
It's our family health.
Macario.
Why you have you never told me who taught you how to cure?
Where do you get the water from? All of this...
...the house, so many things.
I'm afraid, Macario.
You watch your children...
...and do the house work.
Everything else is your husband's.
Macario...
Why don't we go back to the other house?
MAcARlO dld BUSlNESS HERE
Easy!
Why are you doing this to us?
So you'll learn what's the authority.
You two keep on searching.
Get out!
Open it!
But sir, what have we done?
You are sorcerers, blasphemers and heretics. come on.
But sir, why do break it? Here's the key.
Law doesn't need keys. come on, open it!
Break those bottles.
It doesn't seem sane what you're saying, Macario.
Remember that if you're discovered lying by this court...
We can get the truth by means of torture.
I swear sir that I have told the whole truth.
When did you start to cure the sick?
I have already said so, sir. the first one was my son...
How did you know how to cure him?
When you walk on the mountain, you learn many things.
If we went to the mountain with you, would we learn to cure too?
It would depend on you and not me what you learn, sir.
Isn't it the devil who taught you how to cure, Macario?
No, sir, it's not the devil.
I'd say that it was
God, our lord.
And maybe even the
Holy Virgin.
And how could you know who is going to die and who isn't?
You learnt that on the mountain too?
I'd say that I learnt that with the sick themselves.
When you practice, there's no possible mistake.
Where do you notice it? In the eyes?
In the feet and in the head, sir.
Officer! the prisoner must wait outside!
We're going to deliberate.
If this man is a charlatan...
...the punishment will only be to cut his tongue...
...and pillory him for one week.
But if he has a pact with the devil...
...the torment and he'll be burnt at the stake. that's why I believe it's very important to clearly define...
...if he's a charlatan or a sorcerer. there's a test that has come to my mind...
A test?
- What is it about?
- It's very easy.
Some of our prisoners are ill, aren't they? true. the blasphemous
Jewish is dying.
Well, let's put all the sick in a cell...
...and we'll put in there a healthy one as well.
A soldier or the executioner...
...the executioner is very healthy.
And Macario should tell us what is going to happen. that way we'll know if he's either a charlatan or a sorcerer.
Very good idea.
Excellent, isn't it?
We can also include the condemned person that will be executed tomorrow. that's true.
Give the instructions.
- Are here all the sick?
- All of them.
Well, I have reserved these two beds.
One is for the condemned person.
Get him here.
You are going to be on the other. don't make me lie here!
I want nothing with sorcerers. come on, don't be stupid.
What can he do to you?
If I knew, I wouldn't be afraid.
Please leave me in my job.
I only know how to torture and hang people, and I do that well.
If you want it, I can fill the sorcerer's ears with lead...
...but I don't want to be lying here, alone with him
Stop your sobbing! take that hood out an lie down!
Let them know that everything is ready.
I'm sweating...
...and my heart is beating as if it were to explode!
Please don't do this to me!
Shut up and obey!
You're shaking, sweating and you're pale... that's good. You look sicker than the other.
Have mercy on me!
If you're keep on like this, you'll have a reason to cry.
He's asked to be alone with the sick.
It's the only way his wisdom comes out.
We'll please him. Let's leave him alone.
Not this one?
Nor this one that looks so bad?
Not anyone?
Anyone what?
Anyone what? this one!
I will.
Me, what? What about me?
Sirs, I can tell you, sirs.
Well Macario, we're waiting for your diagnosis.
- We'll see the surprise!
- Let's see.
Everybody is going to live, but one.
I've already said so! charlatan!
Of course the dying one will die.
Everyone will live, except that one.
See who he's chosen.
You'll lose your tongue, Macario.
We won't need to burn him.
Even the condemned person will live? tell the dying one to get up!
He's dead! His heart stopped beating. this is heavy!
I bring a pardon from
His Excellency. the condemned person will only be in prison for life.
A pardon.
He's given a pardon so he can pray from his cell...
...for the health of the son of
His Excellency the Viceroy...
...who is very ill.
Out of hell! truly from hell!
He is a sorcerer with no doubt.
He knew it exactly.
And the dying one was pretending to avoid torment.
He was healthy.
It's strange.
It's a miracle, sir.
Miraculously, the
Holy Virgin!
I trust the power of the Holy Office. the works of the devil are false. that's what they are, hoaxes.
My husband...
I'm impressed. they have told me about a miraculous man with powers over life and dead.
You too, my wife?
It's too much!
I would have believe from a peasant, but..
I'm a mother and l see my son dying.
My lady, Viceroys can't have anything to do with devil's sorcerers.
Our prestige is jeopardized.
I don't care about prestige!
I care about my son's life.
We must bring that man.
He won't come. then I'll look for him to his cell wit my son in my arms...
...and will see how prestige is endangered more.
Oh my God!
Macario.
Macario, why are you in chains? this cell...
How did you manage to get in and see me?
I took what we had hidden...
...and I've given to these people.
And our children? they are at chona's.
Because...
...the soldiers broke into our house...
...they destroyed everything...
...they spilled your medicine...
It doesn't matter any more. they are going to do the same to you?
Well, you see...
...you mustn't believe that they'll burn me...
...that won't be true....
...nor that I'll be tormented.
It is sure that it won't happen.
No, Macario, no.
Macario, come with me. the
Viceroy's son is very ill.
You'll have the chance to cure him.
If you cure him, you'll be very lucky.
You can be the doctor at the court.
How am I going to cure him if l don't have any more medicine?
You spilled it.
If that boy could be saved...
...there's no medicine
You'll find a way. Follow me!
Macario...
...our health you said,
I brought it with me.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Where is the ill boy, sir? can't you hear the mother's sobbing? come on, get in at once!
Excuse me, sir...
...I've got to see him alone.
As you wish.
But remember, you'll be pardoned if you save him. torment and fire if he dies.
My friend...
...this cannot be...
...you can't take this one away...
...don't you know that I'll be tortured and burnt if you take him?
What are you doing there?
Go to the other side!
I ask it remembering that turkey.
Go to the other side...
Let him live...
But you got me into this.
I didn't ask for it!
I can do nothing. It's a Supreme Order. think on my children when they see me burning.
And think on me!
...Still alive, but burning and screaming!
Let me cure him.
Please, my friend.
You have called me friend.
..show me that you are.
Let me cure him.
Let him live.
Open the door, please.
Is the boy cured?
Open the door!
Help me!
Help me!
How do you do, Macario?
You're just in time.
And as usual, I'm ready to help you.
See how mistaken you were about your guest.
If I were the invited one, nothing would have happened to you. come, and I'll show you how to be a winner. come on, hurry up!
I've already told you that
I don't want your help!
Go away, leave me alone,
I've had enough!
And besides you!
It's again you, my lord... don't leave them reach me, my lord.
It's you who pull them, Macario.
Your deeds follow you... don't run anymore and face them. think about saving your part that doesn't die. think about you. think about your deeds.
Weight them and judge them.
I've got to run, my lord.
I've got to run.
Welcome to my cavern, Macario.
Hide me. they're going to reach me.
Why did you betray me?
I haven't betrayed you...
And I'm with you more than ever. this is a place that no man has seen yet. there are things here that you should learn. come.
Look Macario. this is mankind...
You can see lives burning quietly...
Sometimes the winds of war or the winds of plague blow...
...and lives extinguish by milliards randomly... the high ones...
...the small ones...
...the right ones...
...the twisted ones.
Now there is peace.
Look at them burning.
Each one is made of different wax.
Each one is unique. they last depending on the material the flame is burning... can you see this stub of a candle? this is the life of the Viceroy's son.
You can see it here. A life.
You can see how fragile, how delightful and how brief it is.
Like a butterfly from eternity.
And you've been playing and trading with this...
...and you never understood the significance of the gift I gave you.
Look at this flame! the Viceroy's son is dead now.
Why did you do that?
It was the time. there's a supreme order.
..there are laws. there are many things that you don't understand.
And what about my candle?
Where is my candle?
I want to see it.
- It's extinguishing!
- Yes.
Aren't you going to do anything?
Are you going to let it extinguish? there's an order,
Macario.
But you can! there are many candles extinguished! don't let it extinguish.
Everything has its end and its place.
We can't do nothing. don't touch it!
I know what you're going to do.
It's in vain, Macario. Who do you what to escape from? From me? From you? come back!
It's the moment to rest and be judged.
A story ends, and another one starts.
When the deeds of mankind finish...
It's because the judgement is going to begin.
Macario, don't run anymore.
What for?
Macario, Macario, Macario!
Macario!
He's never back this late.
Always at sunset.
He went out so happily today.
Macario!
Macario!
Macario!
Macario!
He's here!
He's sleeping.
Macario.
Macario.
You were like a child.
With your whim.
I am so glad. to have given you that whim.
Life wasn't easy, Macario.
But it was good to have lived it together.
Macario...
I'm going to make our children to be like you.
Good men.
He couldn't even finish his turkey. the End. translated by:

ORPHEUS'S WILL
OR DON'T ASK ME WHY.
The film producer can
make many people dream
the same dream together.
At the same time he can show realistically...
unreal fantasy.
In short, an admirable vehicle for poetry.
My film is just a strip-tease show
where I take off my body
to reveal my soul.
For there is a vast shadow public
avid for the truth
which will one day be the sign of this era.
Here, then, is a poet's legacy
to the youth which has always supported him.
As for my mortarboard
I'll send it to the time
from which I managed to escape.
The professor, please.
What are you?
Are you his son?
My father was an architect.
I'd like to be a professor but I can't be yet.
Very well then...
I'd forgotten my gloves.
I'd have to frighten him again.
Excuse me.
How charming!
This was my second meeting with a person
whose destiny I was illogically complicating.
Don't be afraid.
I'm wearing this for a bet.
Is that the professor in the invalid chair?
Yes, sir.
Can you explain...
Impossible.
May I ask him something?
The professor can neither hear nor speak.
When he was small his mother had a shock... and knocked him on his head.
He never suffered from it... but one day...
A mistake!
The professor's life hung on a thread.
It broke.
At last I had the box which was to set me free.
I caressed it lovingly.
It's nothing.
I'll close my eyes... then we can go on.
An injection, professor?
No, just leave me alone.
I'll be better in a moment.
It's because of that fall.
You never know what will happen on account... of these stupid accidents.
The baby professor ought to have had another fall
but the eternal had made me responsible for it.
Don't you recognize me?
It seems to me...
Try hard.
Didn't I see you in my youth?
That's it.
I was only 13 but I remember.
I was frightened to death.
I'd like to understand...
Professor... you're probably the only person in the world who wouldn't try to understand and who's capable of understanding the incomprehensible.
I wanted to know too much.
I was foolish and I'm paying for it.
I wandered off into space-time.
I was looking for you.
This is the costume of the period where a dangerous adventure took me.
What year is it?
Hell! If I've worked it out right... we should be in 2209.
I won't be living then.
Professor Langevin...
...was naïve like all scientists.
Only the 19th century believed in exact sciences.
Professor Langevin didn't know that time obeyed the same laws as space.
250 years have passed since you left but your return cancels them.
And those 250 years don't concern either of us.
Might I ask how you've managed to travel through time?
Poets know a lot of things.
Perhaps more than we do.
Professor, it's not easy to explain the eternal... much less live in it.
It's complicated.
I've just seen you several times... not in chronological order at different ages.
Only a minute ago
I saw you very old.
Your feeble hand dropped... this box.
I took it.
And I think I did you... and myself a service.
It's wonderful to know... that you are not just a humbug and that I'll overcome my difficulties.
Alas, I shall not be able to reveal my discovery.
But for you it would die with me.
Am I wrong?
That's fine, then.
Tell me, my dear sir... as man to man... did I die in your presence?
I have a very bad memory for the future.
You recognize these?
I think so.
Only powder counts.
It's because of them I am looking for you through time.
I believe they travel faster than light.
Let me be your guinea-pig.
It's my salvation.
My only way back.
Have you a gun?
Only a crossbow.
I have a pistol in my drawer.
A scientist has to.
- You smoke?
- Certainly.
So as to smoke in 1770...
I had to invent the cigarette.
They told me it was ridiculous and would never catch on.
You know that for my experiment...
I must first kill you.
Relatively...
Sure you'll succeed?
No doubt at all.
I shall unfold time.
All your experience... will be wiped out.
Oh yes?
You're not afraid?
Ready?
Fire!
The professor fully understood
that a mere change of clothes was not sufficient
to ensure a change of time.
Good luck!
I owe you all!
But I'm not responsible for what happens.
I'll take the risk.
I had recognized the photo of Cégeste...
from my film Orpheus.
I didn't like him.
I suspected he was trying to track me
and I'd better not follow.
Fate let me think
I was being imprudent...
throwing away his picture.
Cégeste!
You named me.
Hardly recognized you.
You were blonde.
In a film.
But this is real life.
You were dead.
Like everyone.
Why come by sea?
Why! Always why.
Don't try to understand.
I've heard that before.
You wrote it.
Take this flower...
This flower is dead.
Aren't you a phenixologist?
What's that?
The science of dying and being born again.
I don't like that.
Come, let's be going.
Where to?
Don't ask questions.
Judith has cut off the head
of Captain
Nebuchadnezzar Holofernes.
A servant waits at the door of the room
where it happened.
Judith is no longer the daughter of a rich banker.
She is the sarcophagus
containing her own legend.
That is how she passes by moonlight
before the sleeping guards.
Now... listen please, everybody!
Who was it who wove tapestry and unwove it again?
Penelope.
And who was she?
Penelope was the last trial
Ulysses had to undergo.
Very good.
What does this tapestry show?
Judith and Holofernes.
And who made it?
Jean Cocteau.
Who is Jean Cocteau?
A violinist?
That's right.
And what sort of violin does he play on?
A Stra...
A Stra...
A Strad...
A Stratagem?
No, not a stratagem.
A Stradivarius.
Now let's clap hands for our little candidate.
Hurry up! The cock's crowing.
Turn night into day.
We'll see who gives orders... and who obeys them.
Yes, works of art make themselves.
They hate their parents.
They existed before the artist
discovered them.
But always Orpheus and Oedipus...
I thought when I changed castles I'd change ghosts,
and a flower would drive them away.
Don't insist.
An artist paints his own portrait.
You'll never paint this flower.
Blast and hell!
Aren't you ashamed?
It's up to you.
Show us what you can do.
"On our way."
"Where to?"
"The goddess."
"What goddess?"
"Some call her Pallas, others Minerva.
So be careful."
And if I refuse?
Orders!
I don't advise you to disobey.
And the flower?
Give it to her.
Goddesses are women after all.
I won't go.
"You left me alone where the dead aren't dead."
"Obey."
"I obey."
Hello!
Hello what?
Please excuse me.
I must be the victim of an hallucination.
What are you doing here?
I ask questions.
We are a court of inquiry before which you'll have to explain your activities.
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?
Read the charges.
You are accused of innocence... which is to say you're capable of any crime instead of just one and liable to fall under our jurisdiction.
You are also accused of trying to enter illegally a world not your own.
Guilty or not guilty?
Guilty in both cases.
I'm haunted by crimes
I have not committed.
I've often tried to jump over the mysterious wall on which men write their loves and their dreams.
Why?
Through boredom and dislike of habits.
Also through disobedience and that spirit of creation which is the acme of contradiction inherent is us.
If I am not mistaken...
Disobedience is a religion with you.
Without it what would children, heroes... and artists do?
Count on their lucky stars.
We are not here to make speeches.
Put that flower on the table.
Where did you get it?
Cégeste gave it me.
Cégeste?
Isn't that a temple in Sicily?
It's also the poet in my film.
Before, it was the name of an angel in my poem.
What is a film?
A film is a petrifying source of thought.
It brings dead acts to life.
It makes it possible to give... apparent reality to the unreal.
What is unreal?
What is beyond our limits.
So there are people like a sleeping invalid dreaming they are healthy.
Excellent definition of a poet.
And what is a poet?
One who, by making poems... uses a language neither alive nor dead which few people speak... and few understand.
And why do they speak this language?
To get in touch with their peers in a world where exhibitionism consists of revealing one's soul and is carried on by the blind.
Who are you?
His adopted son.
My real name is Edward.
I'm a painter.
He says you're a poet and your name is Cégeste.
Is Cégeste a nickname?
Pen name would be nearer the mark.
Your French language is very subtle.
A few minutes ago you used... an idiom you have no right to use in this world.
True enough.
I did so in a moment of anger.
Don't do it again.
Who gave you the right to appear to this man... and give him this flower?
This flower was dead.
I was ordered to give it him so he could revive it.
Can you give proof of your powers?
Disappearing won't convince us.
Disappearing's not nice.
No more than... the phenomenon which makes men who love free the loved one.
You're mad!
Sorry! It happens to me too.
I advise you not to make heavy humour... about things which may reveal human vanity.
Have no fear on that score.
We want proof of your powers.
I share his opinion... that what can be proved is vulgar.
You must take my word.
Trying to teach me?
That's the end.
I've noted that.
I'm listening.
Did you write...
"This body which holds us does not know our being.
"That which inhabits us is inhabited.
"And these bodies inside one another are the bodies of eternity."
Yes, I wrote it.
And who told you this?
What?
These things you say.
No one.
You lie!
All right, if you agree we are subject to a force which guides and dictates to us.
It's possible he's mad.
Or an intellectual.
Leporello pretended to be his master.
The poet's like that.
Stop chattering.
And listen to me.
I was humbly explaining.
You don't have to be humble.
Just reply to our questions.
You're just a mixture of forests and swamps and rivers populated by enormous beasts which eat one another.
Don't try to be clever.
Your address?
I live here with a friend whose host I am.
What's that?
There aren't any here where we are.
We're nowhere.
And yet I've just seen a tapestry decorating the house...
I'm speaking of.
You may well have seen this tapestry... but that's because we wanted you to see it.
We can't help your credulity.
Bring the witness.
Where am I?
That is question unworthy of a man of science.
It's the sort of thing a pretty woman would say on waking.
I was asleep in bed...
You still are asleep, professor.
You just don't dream us.
You're occupying one of those folds in time which you have been the studying.
Research which honours your intelligence... but of which we disapprove.
When you wake up... you'll remember us as if we were people in your dream.
You know this man?
You've a short memory, professor.
Of course, you're asleep.
You've just destroyed my Louis XV chrysalis, cape, boots, jabot, white wig, whip, spurs and all.
I don't complain.
You warned me you couldn't be responsible.
Why are you here?
Here, gentlemen, it is I who give orders.
So be quiet and answer my questions.
How... did you meet this man?
- Quite simple.
- So you say.
Silence!
I was giving up hope of completing my methods of resurrection and I'd have given up if this man, endowed with powers of which I know nothing had not left our continuum to make a journey through eternity and returned from my future to my present proving I had succeeded.
I made the experiment on him.
I'd add that for fear of losing my colleagues' esteem
I threw my discovery into the Seine which flows past my window.
So you succeeded in restoring a man lost in time?
Only just.
I saved him from his own trap where he had felt.
And made me fall into another... the sort of twilight in which I move since I left your laboratory.
I'm sorry about that.
It's possible my discovery is not perfect.
I'm glad I destroyed it.
What form... does this discovery take?
A box of bullets that travel faster than light.
It was the box I threw away.
Let's hope there'll be no ill effects.
It was the wise thing to do.
By proudly disorganizing... even the unsuccessful measures... taken throughout your world's history... men run the risk of breaking a chain... and call it progress.
But you are condemning all of science.
What you call science!
There is one of the soul which is more important.
I beg of you...
Excuse me.
What could you say if you had to defend this man?
That he is a poet, which makes him indispensable though I don't know what for.
May I now ask you a question?
We'll see if I can reply.
Mere curiosity of a man of science...
Here it is... what time is it?
There is no time, professor.
Go on sleeping.
You are free.
Thank you.
I seem to have difficulty... a sort of fatigue...
Sleep.
Sleep, professor.
I want you to.
My respects to you, madam.
I'm sleeping.
Pleasant dreams.
I'm well aware that your road is a labyrinth far distant from ours... although the two overlap... and though you might discover someone to correct your disobedience of terrestrial laws... this was not due to a distraction of the unknown... but a sort of supreme indulgence... which you sometimes abuse... and which you may lack one day.
If I exceed my responsibilities... it is because I wanted to warn you... before consulting your guide on his privileges... and responsibilities.
I don't understand.
You don't have to.
Don't play the village idiot.
I think you understand very well but are playing the fool so as not to own up.
But, madam...
Silence!
Consider yourself lucky that the court is being indulgent.
Come here.
Yes... you.
Are you sure you didn't take the initiative in merging these personalities because having two annoyed you?
Weren't you tempted to make only one at the service of this man who is not only... your father but your adopted father?
Madam, you must be informed regarding the infinity of reigns and orders which makes it difficult to know what persons should obey others and who should be obeyed.
Quite so.
What strange road did you take in order to appear?
Through fire and water.
The result, I presume... of laws of which I am the slave and must obey.
Since you persist
I would at least like to know what is the extent of your power of metamorphosis.
Don't look astonished.
I'm speaking of the change of an orchid into a death head.
This macabre masquerade corresponded, I suppose, to phenomena of a resurrectional nature.
Was it just to impress this man... or in some way to warn him?
No, this is a ceremonial rite of which I can say no more.
The accused refuses to reply.
Take a note of that.
Have you anything further to say in your defence?
If I deserve punishment there is none worse than living between two elements.
Or, in your terms, between two reigns.
In film language, "false colours".
I'd give anything to walk the earth again instead of losing myself in the universe.
Outside our competence.
The court will decide.
The rogatory commission condemns you... to the sentence of life.
The minimum.
And at your age.
Your flower.
And the princess...
You know that she claimed to transgress the laws of time.
And Orpheus?
He didn't survive.
And Eurydice went back to hell.
A great human voice said...
"Don't spit against the wind."
Take the flower.
I don't dare to.
It's not the first time or the last I take this flower and give it back.
This time I understand the courage of your act and the risk you run... she and you.
We can't be worse off.
What have you been condemned to?
To judge others.
To be judges.
Not amusing.
I find this rogatory commission suspect.
Our works kill their authors and get away.
But... the creatures of our imagination are still suspicious about their origins.
I wonder...
Best not to.
I wonder if you yourself...
It's possible.
Sometimes I'm annoyed with you.
Sometimes I'm glad I live outside the world where I was.
But I'd like to save you from your situation.
But we know nothing of yesterday and tomorrow you humans are subjected to them, and to succeed I must guide you or rather follow you through obstacles after which I shall obtain what I want.
Couldn't you enlighten me as to the obstacles?
I don't know them myself.
I'm at sea.
The only thing I know is that this flower is made of your blood and follows your destiny.
I've already told you too much.
Just obey.
I'll obey.
Your Ladyship?
Who's the murderer?
I don't know, My Lady.
Incredible!
You're making me read right through a book which will only be published in 70 years.
Excuse me, My Lady.
Damn your excuses!
Who are these gentlemen?
What gentlemen, My Lady?
These two strangers who walk in my house.
I see no one, My Lady.
You think I'm mad?
Oh, My Lady!
You can go.
What times we live in!
Everything's going badly today.
Is it she?
Don't be ridiculous.
She is just out of date.
You should know that can happen.
Very odd dogs.
PRIVATE PROPERTY
TRAPS
Is it she?
No, that's Isolde.
She's on every boat looking for Tristan.
I think I went with Cégeste
past the Saint-Pierre Chapel that I painted in 1957
as my own coffin presented to the Beaulieu fishermen
in memory of my past youth
and to the fishermen of Villefranche, where I lived.
Well, what is it?
Didn't you see him?
Just as I see you.
He ignored me.
You said if you met him you'd cut him.
He hates me.
He has reason to.
He's taken your insults.
I'll kill him.
You may be immortal, but if you do you'll find nobody else.
Where was he going?
More questions!
He's probably going where you come from.
You spend your time trying to be.
That turns you away from life.
Mustn't keep the gods waiting.
I am the key to dreams...
the sad column...
the Virgin in the Iron Mask.
Is that she?
Your fault, Peleponnesus.
Other dangers threaten for at night statues are dressed in black and murder travellers.
I myself am not a bust...
I've enough sea spume in my veins to understand wave language.
Washing their linen on their knees they're insulting you, making fun of you.
Intellectual lovers.
Autograph, please?
Who is the idol who is eating autographs?
A machine for making you famous in a minute.
Afterwards?
One must be known... Uneasy!
In advanced countries, the working days are short.
What's coming out?
Novels, poems, song, and so on.
The machine stops till autograph hunters feed it.
Then it digests, meditates and sleeps.
Six eyes and four mouths.
Don't ask me why.
Well, I must leave you now.
Sorry, it's orders.
Who gives them?
Even if I knew I wouldn't say.
Stay with us, Cégeste.
You think you can live with men for they condemn to death?
Don't leave me.
Anyhow you must have a mirror to disappear.
Mirrors reflect too much.
They think they are profound.
How will you go?
Close your eyes.
Open them.
Where are you?
Very far and very near.
On the other side of the medal.
I've said it often enough.
"Aren't you tired of trying to understand for 70 years?"
Where are you, Cégeste?
"Where you put me."
"Where you put me."
I was so tired
I though I could hear the women kneeling
making fun of me at their washing.
If you'd be kind enough to wait a minute, the Minister will receive you.
I waited.
I waited.
I waited.
In a few minutes... the President will receive you.
I waited...
I was still waiting.
If you would be so kind to wait a few minutes...
His Serene Highness's first secretary will receive you.
There were a lot of minutes and I waited still.
If you will wait a few minutes...
His Majesty will receive you.
Ifyou wait long enough...
you change into a waiting room.
Give up all hope.
I was afraid of it.
Should I sign my name?
Not necessary.
Go straight in.
Lazarus did not smell too good either.
There is even a picture with Martha and Mary covering their noses...
Excuse me...
How horrible!
How horrible... how horrible!
Pretend to weep, friends,
since the poets are only pretending to be dead.
The Sphinx, Oedipus...
what we wanted to know...
it is possible to meet him, one day
without seeing it.
From this walking sleep
I awoke on a road
and as I was wondering which way to go
I thought I heard the motorcyclists of my film Orpheus.
I knew theirjob.
I had to suffer the same fate
as Cégeste.
But I was wrong...
They were speed cops.
- Your papers?
- Why?
A man on foot is normally suspect.
Hurry! Follow me.
The earth, after all, is not the place for you.
Ask him for a signature.
Well, what d'you know!
So there we are.
A joyous wave has just swept over my parting film.
Ifyou didn't like it, I'm sorry
for I put all into it
like all the workers of my team.
My flower is a hibiscus flower.
Ifyou recognized one or two famous actors,
they weren't in the film because they are famous
but because they suit their parts
and are my friends.
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo
Good luck will rub off when he shakes hands with you
Chim chiminy chim chim cheree
Chim cheroo
All right, ladies and gents.
Comical poems suitable for the occasion, extemporised and thought up before your very eyes.
All right, here we go.
Room here for everyone
Gather around
The constable's responstable.
Now, how does that sound?
Hmm...
Hello, Miss Lark
I got one for you
Miss Lark likes to walk in the park...
- Grrrr.
- ...with Andrew!
Arf! Arf!
- Hello, Andrew.
- Arf! Arf! Grrrr! Grrrr!
Ah, Mrs Cory
A story for you
Your daughters were shorter than you, but they grew.
Dear Miss Persimmon...
Yes?
Wind's in the east
Mist comin' in
Like something is brewin'
About to begin
Can't put me finger on what lies in store
But I feel what's to happen
All happened before
Arf! Arf! Grrrr!
I'm sorry. Where was I?
Thank you, one and all, for your kind support.
Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.
Crikey.
Bless you, guv.
Generosity itself, that's what you are.
No charge.
Oh, it's you. Hello.
Number 17 Cherry
Tree Lane, you say?
All right. Come with me.
This here's Cherry Tree Lane.
Nice little spot, you might say.
Number 17 is just down a bit.
Now this imposing edifice what first greets the eye is the home of Admiral Boom, late of His Majesty's navy.
Likes his house shipshape and
Bristol fashion at all times.
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.
- Three minutes and six seconds.
- Aye, aye, sir.
What he's famous for is punctuality.
The whole world takes its time from Greenwich, but Greenwich takes its time from Admiral Boom.
What cheer, Admiral?
Good afternoon!
Where are you bound?
Some parties want to see number 17.
- Enter that in the log.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Some advice, young man.
Storm signals are up at 17.
Heavy weather brewing there.
Thank you, sir.
I'll keep an eye skinned.
Here we are.
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, residence of George Banks, esquire.
Hello, hello, hello.
The admiral's right.
Heavy weather brewing at number 17, and no mistake.
Leave her alone!
Don't you be trying to stop the wretched creature!
Let her go and good riddance.
I never liked her from the moment she set foot in the door.
But who'll get stuck with the children? Me, that's who!
Her and her high and mighty ways.
And that face of her that would stop a coal barge, it would.
Indeed, Mrs Brill!
I wouldn't stay in this house another minute for all the jewels in Christendom.
No, Katie Nanna, don't go!
Stand away from that door!
What'll I tell the master about the children?
It's no concern of mine.
Those beasts ran away from me.
They must be somewhere.
Did you look around the zoo?
You think the lion got them?
They're fond of hanging around the cage.
I've said my say.
I've done with this house forever.
Hip, hip, hooray!
Don't stumble on the way out.
No, no, Katie Nanna!
Mrs Banks. She's home.
Our daughter's daughters will adore us
And we'll sing in grateful chorus
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"
Good evening,
Katie Nanna and Ellen.
The meeting was glorious!
Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained herself to the prime minister's carriage.
You should have been there!
And Mrs Ainslie was carried off to prison.
Singing and scattering pamphlets all the way!
Madam, I've always given my best...
Thank you, Katie Nanna.
I knew you were one of us.
We're clearly soldiers in petticoats
And dauntless crusaders for women's votes
Though we adore men individually
We agree that as a group they're rather stupid
Mrs Banks...
Cast off the shackles of yesterday
Shoulder to shoulder into the fray
Our daughter's daughters will adore us
And they'll sing in grateful chorus
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"
I don't wish to offend, but...
From Kensington to Billingsgate
One hears the restless cries
From every corner of the land
Womankind, arise
Political equality and equal rights with men
Take heart, for Mrs Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again
No more the meek and mild subservients we
We're fighting for our rights militantly
Never you fear
If I may have a word...
So cast off the shackles of yesterday
Shoulder to shoulder into the fray
Our daughter's daughters will adore us
And they'll sing in grateful chorus
"Well done"
Mrs Banks!
"Well done"
Mrs Banks!
What is it, Katie Nanna?
I have something to say to you.
Where are the children?
The children, to be precise, are not here.
They've disappeared again.
That's really careless of you.
That's the third time this week.
The fourth, madam.
I've had my fill.
I'm not one to speak ill of the children.
When do you expect them home?
I couldn't say. If you'd compute my wages...
Oh, gracious! You're not leaving?
What will Mr Banks say?
He'll be cross when he finds the children missing.
Put these away. The cause infuriates Mr Banks.
I beseech you, please reconsider.
Think of the children.
Think of Mr Banks. He was just getting used to you.
Posts, everyone!
Fire!
- I do beseech you...
- My wages, if you please.
Bit early tonight, Admiral?
Nonsense. Bang on the dot, as usual.
How's the world of finance?
Never better.
Money's sound, credit rates are moving up,
- and the pound is admired everywhere.
- Good.
How about you?
Bit chancy, I'd say.
The Wind's up.
The glass is falling.
- Don't like it.
- Good. Good, good.
Banks, you're steering into a nasty piece of weather.
Banks!
Do you hear me?
Hello, Katie Nanna. That must be heavy. Allow me.
Hmph!
What a very pretty hat.
I feel a surge of deep satisfaction
Much as a king astride his noble steed
Thank you.
When I return from daily strife to hearth and wife
How pleasant is the life I lead
- Dear, the children...
- Yes, yes, yes.
I run my home precisely on schedule
At 6:01, I march through my door
My slippers, sherry, and pipe are due at 6:02
Consistent is the life I lead
George, they're missing.
Splendid, splendid.
It's grand to be an
Englishman in 1910
King Edward's on the throne It's the age of men
I'm the lord of my castle
The sovereign, the liege
I treat my subjects servants, children, wife
With a firm, but gentle hand Noblesse oblige
It's 6:03, and the heirs to my dominion are scrubbed and tubbed
And adequately fed
And so I'll pat them on the head and send them off to bed
Ah, lordly is the life I lead
Winifred, where are the children?
They're not here, dear.
Of course they're here.
Where else would they be?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
They're missing. Katie Nanna has looked everywhere.
Very well. I'll deal with this at once.
The police station.
Quickly, please.
We needn't bother the police. The fact is...
Facts cloud the issue.
One fact alone is clear.
Katie Nanna's faltered.
She's disappointed us.
I shall bring her to book...
Oh.
- She's left us, hasn't she?
- Yes, only just.
George Banks here.
17 Cherry Tree Lane.
It's a matter of some urgency.
Please send a policeman.
The policeman's here, George.
What? Oh. Very prompt.
Wonderful service.
Thank you so much. Good night.
Come in, constable.
While on duty across the park,
I noted some stray valuables.
- I believe they're yours.
- Valuables?
Come along now.
Jane.
Michael.
Winifred, don't be emotional.
I wouldn't be too hard on them, sir.
They've had a long, weary walk today.
Children, come here at once.
Well?
- Sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.
- It was windy...
And the kite was too strong.
The kite ran away, sir, not the children.
Thank you. I'll manage this.
It wasn't a good kite.
We made it ourselves.
Perhaps if you helped us...
That's the ticket.
Kites are skittish things.
Only last week...
I'm very grateful to you, constable.
The cook will find you a plate of something.
I shall now return to my duties.
Thank you, constable.
Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am. Good night, sir.
"Cook will find something."
I'm awfully sorry about this, George.
You'll want to discuss it.
I would, indeed.
Ellen, take the children upstairs.
Yes, sir.
I knew it.
Who bears the brunt of everything?
Me, that's who.
They don't want an honest working girl here.
They need a ruddy zoo keeper.
Sorry.
When I chose Katie Nanna,
I thought she'd be firm.
She looked solemn, cross.
Never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint.
I'll do better next time.
Next time? You've engaged six nannies.
They've all been unqualified disasters.
I quite agree.
Choosing a nanny is a delicate task, requiring insight, balanced judgment, and an ability to read character.
Under the circumstances, it might be apropos to select the next person myself.
Would you, George?
I'll do this properly.
I'll advertise in The Times.
- Take this down, please.
- Yes, of course.
Wanted... No, required...
Nanny.
Firm, respectable, no-nonsense.
A British nanny must be a general
The future empire lies within her hands
And so the person that we need to mould the breed
It is a nanny who can give commands
- Getting this, Winifred?
- Yes, every word.
A British bank is run with precision
A British home requires nothing less
Tradition, discipline, and rules must be the tools
Without them disorder, catastrophe, anarchy
In short, you have a ghastly mess
Splendid, George. Inspirational.
The Times will be so pleased.
- Father.
- Yes?
We've discussed everything, and we're very sorry about today.
I should think so.
- It was wrong.
- Indeed.
We'll cooperate with the new nanny.
I'll be glad for your help.
That's why we wrote this advertisement.
Advertisement for what?
The new nanny.
- You wrote an...
- George, let's listen.
You wanted our help.
Oh, very well.
"Wanted, a nanny for two adorable children."
"Adorable." That's debatable, I must say.
"If you want this choice position
"Have a cheery disposition"
Jane, I don't...
"Rosy cheeks, no warts
I wrote that.
"Play games, all sorts
"You must be kind
"You must be witty
"Very sweet and fairly pretty"
- That's...
- George, please.
"Take us on outings, give us treats
"Sing songs, bring sweets
"Never be cross or cruel
"Never give us castor oil or gruel
"Love us as a son and daughter
"And never smell of barley water"
I wrote that, too.
"If you won't scold and dominate us
"We will never give you cause to hate us
"We won't hide your spectacles so you can't see
"Put toads in your bed or pepper in your tea
"Hurry, nanny
"Many thanks
"Sincerely
"Jane and Michael Banks"
Thank you. Most interesting.
We've had enough of this.
Please return to the nursery.
- They were only trying to help.
- I'm aware of that.
I congratulate myself on stepping in.
"Play games, sing songs, give treats." Ridiculous.
No question in my mind.
Now is the time for action.
The Times, please.
I don't know the number.
Oh, George, you're always so forceful.
The Times? George
Banks, Cherry Tree Lane.
I wish to place an advertisement.
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.
I'll take the report, Mr Binnacle.
Wind's coming from a new quarter.
So it is.
- Sir.
- What?
Something taking place off the port bow.
Ghastly looking crew, I must say.
There's a queue of nannies outside.
Shall I show them in?
I said 8:00, and 8:00 it shall be.
12 seconds to go.
- Posts!
It is now 8:00.
Yes, sir.
I have told you repeatedly, Ellen,
I dislike being hurried into things.
I don't understand.
They're nothing like what we advertised for.
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Michael, look!
- Perhaps it's a witch.
- Nonsense. Witches have brooms.
It's her. It's the person. She's answered our advertisement.
Rosy cheeks and everything.
- Show them in, one at a time.
- Yes, sir.
- Come in, one at a time.
- Thank you.
You are the father of
Jane and Michael Banks?
I said, you are the father of
Jane and Michael Banks?
Yes, of course.
You brought your references?
I never give references.
I believe it very old-fashioned.
We'll see about that then.
Now then, the qualifications.
Item one, "A cheery disposition."
I am never cross.
Item two, "Rosy cheeks."
Obviously.
Item three,
"Play games, all sorts."
They'll find my games extremely diverting.
Where did you get this paper?
I tore it up.
Excuse me.
Item four, "You must be kind."
I am kind, but extremely firm.
Have you lost something?
That paper. I thought that I...
You are George Banks?
And you did advertise for a nanny?
George Banks.
Very well, then.
Tore it up, turned it over, threw it in the...
Are you ill?
I hope not.
About my wages...
- The reference is obscure.
- Obscure.
We must be clear on that.
- I require every second Tuesday off.
- Every Tuesday.
Perhaps a trial period would be wise.
Hmm... I'll give you one week.
I'll know by then.
I'll see the children now.
Close your mouth.
We are not codfish.
Don't stand there.
Best foot forward.
Spit spot.
George?
- Aah!
I thought you were interviewing nannies.
I was, I was.
You've selected one already?
Yes, it's done.
- Where is she?
- In the nursery.
- I put her to work straight-away.
- How clever.
I'd have muddled everything.
Is she everything that we hoped she'd be?
It all happened rather quickly.
I mean, I... I, uh...
Will she be firm and give commands?
Will she mould our young breed?
Winifred, I think she will.
I think she Will!
In that case, perhaps Ellen should dismiss the others.
The others?
- Ellen!
- Yes, sir?
Tell the others the position's been filled.
- The others, sir?
- Yes, the others.
How many nannies does this house need?
The position has been filled.
I'm afraid the nursery isn't very tidy.
Rather like a bear pit.
- That's a funny bag.
- Carpet.
- To carry carpets?
- No, made of.
Your room has a lovely view.
Hmm...
It's not exactly
Buckingham Palace...
Still, it's clean.
Yes, it will be quite suitable.
Just needs a touch here and there.
First things first.
The place to hang a hat is on a hat stand.
Oh!
This will never do.
I much prefer seeing all of my face at once.
But there was nothing in it.
Never judge things by their appearance, even carpetbags.
I never do.
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever."
Hmm... A little more light perhaps.
We'd better watch this one.
- She's tricky.
- She's wonderful.
Much better.
Now, let me see.
That's funny. I always carry it.
It must be here somewhere.
- What?
- My tape measure.
- What for?
- To see how you measure up.
That's the funniest thing I ever saw.
Ah ha ha ha. Here it is.
Good.
Come along, then. Quickly.
Head up, Michael. Don't slouch.
Just as I thought. "Extremely stubborn and suspicious."
- I am not.
- See for yourself.
- "Extremely stubborn and susips..."
- Suspicious.
Now you, Jane.
"Rather inclined to giggle.
Doesn't put things away."
How about you?
Very well. Hold this for me.
As I expected.
"Mary Poppins, practically perfect in every way."
Mary Poppins.
Is that your name? It's lovely.
I've always liked it.
Shall we move?
In your advertisement, did you not request games?
Yes.
First we'll play
"Well Begun Is Half Done."
That sounds suspicious.
Otherwise entitled,
"Let's Tidy Up The Nursery."
I told you she was tricky.
Shall we begin?
It is a game, isn't it?
Depends on your viewpoint.
You see, in every job that must be done, there is an element of fun.
You find the fun, and snap, the job's a game.
And every task you undertake
becomes a piece of cake
A lark, a spree
It's very clear to see
That a
spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way
A robin feathering his nest has very little time to rest
While gathering his bits of twine and twig
Though quite intent in his pursuit
He has a merry tune to toot
He knows a song
Will move the job along
For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way
The honeybees that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb
Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro
Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip
And hence
And hence
They find
They find
Their task is not a grind
Their task is not a grind
Aaah
Cheeky.
Don't be all day.
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out!
Well...
Thank you now.
When you've quite finished!
Thank you.
That's quite sufficient.
Hats and coats, please.
It's time for our outing.
Let's tidy up the nursery again.
Enough's as good as a feast.
You're not as well turned out as I'd like.
Still, there's time.
Spit Spot.
And off we go!
For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In the most delightful way

What I do
Hello, art lovers.
Today I'm a screever
And as you can see
A screever's an artist
Of highest degree
And it's all me own work from me own memory
Not Royal Academy.
Still, they're not bad, are they?

Wait!
Don't move.
Don't move a muscle.
Stay right where you are.
I'd know that silhouette anywhere.
- Mary Poppins!
- Hello, Bert.
You know Jane and Michael.
Well, I've seen them here and about.
Chasing a kite last time, weren't it?
We're going to the park.
To the park?
Not if I know Mary Poppins.
Other nannies go to the park.
When you're with Mary Poppins, quick as you can say,
"Bob's your uncle," the most unusual things happen.
What are you talking about?
It's not my place to say, but she probably has in mind a jolly holiday.
Something along these lines.
That's always good. Here we go.
How about a lovely circus?
Lions and tigers.
World famous artistes performing death-defying feats of dexterity and skill.
Ta-da!
Ta-da!
Oh, that's lovely.
I'd much rather go there.
A typical English countryside done by a loving hand.
Though you can't see it, there's a little country fair down that road.
I don't see any road.
What? No road?
Just wants a bit of something here and a bit of something there.
There.
A country road suitable for travel and high adventure.
May we go, Mary Poppins, please?
Don't you think it's lovely,
Mary Poppins?
Now's the time. No one's looking.
Oh, please. Please.
I have no intention of making a spectacle of myself.
All right. I'll do it myself.
Do what?
Bit of magic.
- Magic?
- It's easy.
Let's see.
You think.
You wink.
You do a double blink.
You close your eyes and jump.
Is something supposed to happen?
Bert, what utter nonsense.
Oh.
Why do you complicate things?
Give me your hand, Michael.
Don't slouch.
Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.
- Do you really think so?
- Cross my heart, you do.
You look fine, too, Bert.
Isn't there a fair?
Down the road and behind the hill.
I hear the merry-go-round.
- Tell them hello.
- Don't smudge the drawing.
Ain't it a glorious day
Right as a mornin' in May
I feel like I could fly
Now, Bert, none of your larking about.
Have you ever seen the grass so green
Or a bluer sky
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary
Mary makes your heart so light
You haven't changed.
When the day is grey and ordinary
Mary makes the sun shine bright
Oh, honestly.
Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her
The daffodils are smiling at the dove
When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand
Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band
You are light-headed.
It's a jolly holiday with Mary
No wonder that it's
Mary that we love
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary
Mary makes your heart so light
When the day is grey and ordinary
Mary makes the sun shine bright
Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her
The daffodils are smiling at the dove, oink, oink
When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand
Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band
It's a jolly holiday with Mary
No wonder that it's
Mary that we love
Thank you.
Our pleasure, Mary Poppins.
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert
Gentlemen like you are few
A vanishing breed.
Though you're just a diamond in the rough, Bert
Underneath your blood is blue
Common knowledge.
You'd never think of pressing your advantage
Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed
A lady needn't fear when you are near
Your sweet gentility is crystal clear
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert
A jolly, jolly holiday with you
Waiter! Waiter?
Now then, what would be nice?
We'll start with raspberry ice
And then some cakes and tea
Order what you will
There'll be no bill
It's complimentary
You're very kind.
Anything for you, Mary Poppins.
You're our favourite person.
Right you are.
It's true that...
Mavis and Sybil have ways that are winning
And Prudence and Gwendolyn set your heart spinnin'
Phoebe's delightful
Maude is disarming
Felicia, Janice and Lydia
Charming!
Cynthia's dashing, Vivian's sweet
Stephanie's smashing,
Priscilla a treat
Veronica, Millicent,
Agnes, and Jane
Convivial company, time and again
Dorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts
I'll agree are three jolly good sports
But cream of the crop, tip of the top is Mary Poppins and there we stop
When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand
Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band
Woo!
It's a jolly holiday with Mary
No wonder that it's
Mary that we love
No wonder that it's
Mary that we love
No wonder that it's
Mary that we love
Yahoo!
Yahoo!
Yahoo! Yahoo!
Our own private merry-go-round.
Nice. Very nice, indeed, if you don't want to go nowhere.
Who says we're not going anywhere?
Oh, guard!
Righto, Mary Poppins.
Thank you.
They're off!
Mary Poppins leads by two lengths, Jane's second by...
My horse is the fastest.
Hear that, mate?
Want to put up with that?
Is that the best you can do?
Hurry up, boy!
Not so fast, please. Michael.
Bert, you're just as bad.
Sorry. Whoa, boy. Whoa.
Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa.
Just a bit of high spirits,
Mary Poppins.
Please control yourself.
We're not on a racecourse.
Follow me, please.
- Good morning.
- Oh, yes, quite. What?
I say.
Have you...
Ever?
Never!
View halloo.
Oh, yes, definitely. A view halloo.
View halloo?
Faith and Begorra.
'Tis them redcoats again.
Oh, musha, musha.
Poor little bloke.
Let's give him a hand.
Saints preserve us.
Yikes!
Tally ho! Da-doo da-doo!
Up you go. Now hang on.
Would you look at this?
An elegant merry-go-round horse.
Come on, you dirty omadhauns.
I'll lick all of you.
Faster, me beauty. Faster!
Riders, would you be kind and let me pass?
Certainly, ma'am.
- Thank you.
- Not at all, ma'am.
Excellent time, gentlemen.
- Quite.
- Perfect day for it.
Ahem.
Oh, how nice.
Hooray! Yay! Yay!
Hold still. Watch the dickie bird.
- How does it feel to win?
- Well...
- Gaining fame and fortune.
- Yes.
- Your picture in the newspaper.
- Actually...
Extreme good looks, may I say?
No words describe your emotion?
Gentlemen, on the contrary, there's a very good word.
- Right?
- Tell them.
Right.
It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
'Cause I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad
Me father gave me nose a tweak and told me I was bad
But then one day I learnt a word that saved me aching nose
The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes
Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
He travelled all around the world
And everywhere he went
He'd use his word and all would say,
"There goes a clever gent"
When dukes and maharajas pass the time of day with me
I say me special word and then they ask me out to tea
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious

You can say it backwards...

- Bit too much?
- Indubitably.
So when the cat has got your tongue
There's no need for dismay
Just summon up this word and then you've got a lot to say
But better use it carefully or it could change your life
For example, I said it to me girl.
Now me girl's me wife.
And a lovely thing she is.
She's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

Jane, Michael!
Stay close now.
Oh, Bert, all your fine drawings.
There's more where they came from.
Meantime, I'm changing businesses.
This is hot chestnut weather.
Come along, children.
- Bye, Bert.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

No, I won't take your nasty medicine!
Do we have to, Mary Poppins?
People with wet feet must take their medicine.
I don't want it.
Oh!
Lime cordial! Delicious!
Strawberry! Mmm!
Rum punch.
Quite satisfactory.
You won't ever leave us, will you?
Do you have a handkerchief?
Will you stay if we're good?
A pie crust promise.
Easily made, easily broken.
Whatever would we do without you?
I'll stay until the wind changes.
How long will that be?
It's time to go to sleep.
We couldn't possibly go to sleep.
So many lovely things happened today!
Did they?
We jumped into Bert's picture.
The horses fled the carousel.
And we went riding!
Tally ho! Tchunga!
Tally ho! Yoicks!
Really?
Don't you remember?
You won the race.
A respectable person like me?
How dare you.
I saw you do it.
Another word and I'll summon a policeman.
I saw it happen!
- Go to sleep.
- I don't want to.
We're much too excited.
Very well. Suit yourselves.
Stay awake
Don't rest your head
Don't lie down
Upon your bed
While the moon
Drifts in the skies
Stay awake
Don't close
Your eyes
Though the world
Is fast asleep
Though your pillow's
Soft and deep
You're not sleepy
As you seem
Stay awake
Don't nod and dream
Stay awake
Don't nod
And dream
Glorious day,
Mr Binnacle, glorious.
Nobody sleeps this morning.
Put in double powder.
A double charge? Aye, sir.
Shake things up a bit, what?
- Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.
- Indeed it is, ma'am.
- You packed the spoiled eggs?
- Yes.
After our meeting, we're all going to throw things at the prime minister.
How distinguished you look today.
What's all that fearful caterwauling?
It's cook singing.
- What's wrong with her?
- She's happy as a cricket.
Since you hired Mary Poppins, the most extraordinary thing has come over the household.
- Ellen hasn't broken a dish all morning.
- That is extraordinary.
She and cook fight like cats and dogs, but today...
- I'll hold the door.
- Thanks ever so.
Ellen, stop making that offensive noise.
And shut the window. That bird's giving me a headache.
Yes, sir.
Quiet! You're giving the master a headache.
I'm sorry you're unwell.
Who said I'm unwell?
I just don't understand why everyone's so confoundedly cheerful.
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
How lovely. Thank you, my darling.
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Stop, stop, stop!
- Good morning, Father.
- Morning.
Mary Poppins taught us...
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
What are you talking about?
Supercali...
Whatever it is.
It's something to say when you don't know what to say.
Yes, well, I always know what to say.
- Yes, hurry along, please.
- Yes, Father.
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Winifred, will you explain this unseemly hullabaloo?
I don't think there's anything to explain.
The children just came in to make you feel better.
I should like to be quite clear.
I am not out of sorts. I'm in a perfectly equable mood.
I do not require being made to feel better!
You're always saying you want a cheerful and pleasant household.
I should like to make a differentiation between cheerful and...
Excuse me, dear.
Posts, everyone, please!
I have no objection to cheerfulness.
I expect certain decorum.
I don't propose standing idly by and letting Poppins undermine the discipline...
There's something extremely odd about this household since that woman arrived, and I've noticed it.
Yes, dear.
One thing more.
Yes, dear?
Have this piano repaired.
I like to have it in tune.
But, George, you don't play.
That is entirely beside the point!
Now, let me see.
We must go to the piano tuners, then to Mrs Cory's shop for some gingerbread, then to the fishmonger's for dover sole and prawns.
Michael, stop stravaging along behind.
Ahoy, there!
Ahoy!
- Good day to you.
- Good morning, Admiral.
What fine adventure are we off upon today?
Going to fight the Hottentots?
Dig for buried treasure?
We're going to buy fish.
Very good. Proceed at flank speed.
Aye, aye, sir.
Let's put our backs into it.
More spit and polish.
That's what's wanted.
Andrew.
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Slow down. I can't understand a word.
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Again?
The poor man.
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Woof! Ah-choo!
Bless you.
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Why, yes, certainly.
I'll go straight-away.
- Thank you very much.
- Woof!
- What did he say?
- "You're welcome."
- And?
- He didn't say anything.
You know best.
I thought we were buying fish.
There's been a change of plans.
Come along, please.
Don't straggle.
Andrew, worrying won't help anyone.
You should go home and rest.
Woof!
- Bert, I'm glad you're here.
- I came right away.
How is he?
He's never been worse.
How about them?
It's contagious, you know.
- We'll get spots?
- Unlikely.
Ohh! Hoo hoo hoo!
Oh, Uncle Albert.
Bless my soul.
It's Mary Poppins.
I'm delight... Ha-ha!
I'm delighted to see you.
Uncle Albert, you promised.
Ha-ha! I know.
I tried, really, I did. I... Ho ho!
But I so enjoy laughing. Ah ha ha!
When I start, it's up with...
Ha ha ha!
That's what happens.
I love to laugh! Ah ho ho!
Oh, my! I can't help it.
Ha ha ha!
I just like laughing.
Ha ha! Ha ha!
Don't you dare.
You'll only make him worse.
- It's quite serious.
- Keep a straight face.
Last time, we took three days to get him down.
I love to laugh
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!
Loud and long and clear
Ha!
I love to laugh
Ha ha ha ha!
It's getting worse every year
Ha ha ha!
The more I laugh
Ho ho ho!
The more I fill with glee
You're no help!
The more the glee
Ha ha ha ha!
The more I'm a merrier me
Hoo hoo hoo!
It's embarrassing.
The more I'm a merrier me
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Some people laugh through their noses
Sounding something like this
Mmm-hmm hmm hmm!
Dreadful.
Sss-sss-sss!
Some people laugh through their teeth Goodness sakes
Hissing and fizzing like snakes
Sss sss sss!
Not at all attractive.
Some laugh too fast
Hee hee hee hee!
Some only blast
Ha!
Others they twitter like birds
Hee hee hee hoo! Hee hee hee hoo!
You're as bad as he is.
Then there's that kind what can't make up their mind
Hmm hmm hmm, ha ha ha!
Hee hee hee, ho ho ho!
Hee ha ho huh?
When things strike me as funny
I can't hide it inside
And squeak, hee, as the squeakelers do
Ha ha ha!
I've got to let go
With a ho ho ho ho
Ha ha ha ha!
And a ho ho ho, hoo!
How nice!
I was hoping you'd turn up.
We always have a jolly time.
We love to laugh
Ha ha ha ha!
Loud and long and clear
Hoo hoo hoo!
We love to laugh
Ha ha ha ha!
So everybody can hear
Ha ha ha!
The more you laugh
Don't you start. Come back here.
We fill With glee
Hee hee hee!
And the more the glee
Ha ha ha ha!
The more we're a merrier we
Welcome, children. Welcome.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Pull up a chair.
I say, you're a sight.
Speaking of sight, it reminds me of me brother.
He works in a watch factory.
What's he do?
He stands about all day and makes faces.
Makes faces in a watch factory!
You made that up.
That's good.
Such behaviour.
It's disgraceful or my name isn't Mary Poppins.
I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.
What's the name of his other leg?
Wasn't that funny?
What's the name of...
Children, it's tea time. I won't have schedule interruptions.
Please stay.
Look, I have tea ready for you.
And it's getting cold.
I had hoped that maybe you would...
Splendid! Thank you very much.
Mind the bread and butter.
Now watch, children.
I knew she'd do it... A proper tea.
I suppose you'll want me to pour.
If I must, I must.
But stop behaving like laughing hyenas.
- Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
- Yes, please.
- Bed?
- None for me.
I'm glad you came.
It wouldn't be fun otherwise.
Pour some milk for
Michael and yourself.
- Nice weather we're having.
- Yes.
The other day when it was cold, a friend bought long underwear.
The shopkeeper said,
"How long do you want it?"
My friend said,
"From September to March."
Jane! Control yourself!
Children, please sit up properly.
- Your tea, Uncle Albert.
- Thank you, dear.
I'm having fun.
I wish you could always stay here.
We'll have to. There's no way down.
Oh, there is a way.
I hate mentioning it because you must think of something sad.
Do it, please.
Let me see.
I've got the very thing.
Yesterday, when my neighbour answered the bell, a man was there.
The man said, "I'm terribly sorry.
I just ran over your cat."
- Oh, that's sad.
- The poor cat.
Then he said,
"I'll replace your cat."
She said, "Okay, but can you catch mice?"
I started out saying...
I try. Really, I do.
But everything ends up so hilarious. I can't...
I can't help...
That will be enough of that.
It's time to go home.
Oh, that is sad. Oh, no.
That's the saddest thing I ever heard.
Come along, children.
Must you really go?
People come to see me all the time, and we have such a lovely time.
Then they go home, and I'm very, very sad about it.
Don't worry. We'll return soon.
It was lovely.
- Keep an eye on him, Bert.
- I'll stay a while.
Thank you.
Uncle Albert,
I got a jolly joke I saved for just such an occasion.
- Want to hear it?
- I'd be so grateful.
Righto. It's about me granddad.
One night, he had a nightmare.
So scared he chewed his pillow to bits.
Next morning, I says,
"How do you feel?"
He says,
"A little down in the mouth."
There's nothing like a good joke.
No, and that's nothing like a good joke.
Bit late tonight, aren't you?
I say, Banks!
Is anything the matter, Banks?
Banks!
We're so glad you're home!
We had the most wonderful afternoon.
I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.
We don't know anyone called Smith.
The second chap says,
"What's his other leg's name?"
And a party on the ceiling.
Children, be quiet.
Mary Poppins says we'll go again.
Oh?
Oh, Mary Poppins said that?
Please return to your room.
Mary Poppins, will you come with me?
As you wish.
Mary Poppins, I regret what I must say.
Good evening, George.
Is anything the matter?
I'm afraid so.
I have to dress for my rally.
- I'd rather you be present.
- Of course, George.
Mary Poppins, I confess
I'm disappointed in you.
She's for it.
I've heard this before.
I don't deny I'm partially responsible for allowing the children's worthless frivolity.
But they must learn the seriousness of life.
But they're only children.
In light of what's happened...
George, are you certain?
I believe I am.
A British bank is run with precision
A British home requires nothing less
Tradition, discipline, and rules must be the tools
Without them disorder, chaos, moral disintegration
In short, you have a ghastly mess
I quite agree.
The children must be moulded, shaped and taught
That life's a looming battle to be faced and fought
I'm disturbed to hear my children talking about popping into pictures, consorting with racehorse persons, fox hunting...
I don't mind that. It's tradition.
But parties on the ceiling?
Having tea parties on the ceiling?
And other highly questionable outings...
If they must go on outings
These outings ought to be fraught with purpose, yes, and practicality
These silly words like
Superca...
Super...
Supercal...
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
Yes, well done.
And popping through pictures have little use, fulfill no basic need
They've got to learn the honest truth
Despite their youth
They must learn
About the life you lead
Exactly.
They must feel the thrill of totting up a balanced book
A thousand ciphers neatly in a row
Quite right.
When gazing at a graph that shows the profits up
Their little cup of joy should overflow
Precisely.
It's time they learnt to walk in your footsteps
My footsteps.
To tread your straight and narrow path with pride
With pride.
Tomorrow, just as you suggest
Pressed and dressed Jane and Michael will be at your side
Splendid! You've hit the nail...
At my side? Where are we going?
To the bank.
- The bank?
- Yes.
Tomorrow's an important day.
I'll see they have a proper night's sleep.
Did I say I'd take the children to the bank?
It sounded that way.
And why not?
Capital idea.
Just the medicine they need for all this sugary female thinking they get here.
Quite right. Good idea.
Quite right.
Mary Poppins, we won't let you go.
What do you mean?
Weren't you sacked?
Sacked? I am never sacked.
- Oh, Mary Poppins!
- Hooray!
Neither am I a maypole.
- But...
- Goats butt.
Birds fly.
Children going out with their father get some sleep.
An outing with Father?
He's never taken us on an outing.
He's never taken us anywhere.
How did you manage it?
You gave him the idea.
How impertinent!
Me giving ideas to people? Really.
- Where's he taking us?
- The bank.
Michael, the city! Father can point out the sights.
Most things he can.
Sometimes people, through no fault of their own, can't see past their nose.
Past their nose?
Yes. Sometimes a little thing is quite important.
Oh, look. The cathedral.
Father passes that every day.
Early each day to the steps of St. Paul's
The little old bird woman comes
In her own special way to the people she calls
Come buy my bags full of crumbs
Come feed the little birds
Show them you care
And you'll be glad if you do
Their young ones are hungry
Their nests are so bare
All it takes is tuppence
From you
Feed the birds
Tuppence a bag
Tuppence, tuppence
Tuppence a bag
Feed the birds
That's what she cries
While overhead, her birds fill the skies
All around the cathedral
The saints and apostles
Look down as she sells her wares
Although you can't see it
You know they are smiling
Each time someone shows
That he cares
Though her words are simple and few
Listen, listen
She's calling to you
Feed the birds
Tuppence a bag
Tuppence, tuppence
Tuppence a bag
Though her words are simple and few
Listen, listen
She's calling to you
Feed the birds
Tuppence a bag
Tuppence
Tuppence
Tuppence a bag
Now, remember. Be on your best behaviour.
Isn't it your bank?
As a younger officer, it is, sort of.
Michael, look.
It's her!
- Who? It's who?
- The bird woman.
Just like Mary Poppins said.
You see her?
Of course I can. Do you think
I can't see past the end of my nose?
Listen, she's saying it.
Feed the birds.
Tuppence a bag.
Of course she's saying it.
- May we feed the birds?
- Whatever for?
- I have tuppence.
- Just this once.
Waste your money on birds?
Certainly not.
But Mary Poppins...
I'm not interested in Mary
Poppins nor in hearing her name.
But it's my tuppence.
Michael, don't throw your money away!
At the bank, I'll show you what to do.
It's extremely interesting.
Hello, Banks.
What's all this about?
My children.
Why are they here?
They're opening an account, sir.
How much money do you have?
Tuppence. I want it to feed the birds.
Tuppence!
Tuppence...
Precisely how I started.
That's the elder Mr Dawes, a giant in the finance world.
A giant?
Father, these are Banks' children!
They want to open an account!
Do they, boy? Excellent. Excellent.
We can use more money to put to work for the bank.
You have tuppence?
May I be permitted to see it?
It's for feeding the birds.
Feed the birds and what have you got?
Fat birds!
But...
If you invest your tuppence wisely in the bank
Safe and sound
Soon that tuppence
Safely invested in the bank
Will compound
And you'll achieve that sense of conquest
As your affluence expands
In the hands of the directors
Who invest
As propriety demands
- May I, sir?
- Carry on, Banks.
You see, Michael, you'll be part of railways through Africa!
Exactly.
Dams across the Nile.
- Talk about the ships.
- Fleets of ocean greyhounds.
Tell them more.
Majestic self-amortizing canals.
It fires the imagination!
Plantations of ripening tea
All from
Tuppence
Prudently, thriftily, frugally invested in the...
To be specific
In the Dawes, Tomes,
Mousley, Grubbs
Fidelity Fiduciary bank
Give me the money, boy.
I want to feed the birds.
Banks!
Yes, sir. Now, Michael...
When you deposit tuppence in a bank account
Go on!
Soon you'll see
Tell him more!
That it blooms into credit of a generous amount
Semi-annually
And you'll achieve that sense of stature
As your influence expands
To the high financial strata
That established credit now commands
You can purchase first and second trust deeds.
Imagine the foreclosures, bonds, chattels, dividends, shares.
Bankruptcies.
Debtor sales.
Opportunities.
Private enterprise.
Shipyards.
- The mercantile.
- Collieries.
Tanneries.
Corporations, amalgamations.
Banks!
While stand the Banks of England,
England stands.
When fall the Banks of England,
England falls!
You see, Michael?
All for the lack of...
Tuppence
Patiently
Cautiously
Trustingly invested in the...
To be specific
In the Dawes, Tomes,
Mousley, Grubbs
Fidelity Fiduciary Bank
Welcome to our joyful family of investors.
Give it back!
Give it back!
Michael, behave...
Give it to him.
Give me back my money!
Give me back my money!
The bank won't give someone their money.
I'm getting mine.
Come along, every penny!
And give me mine, too.
Stop all payments.
Stop all payments.
Give me my money!
Children, come back!
- Stop those children!
- Jane! Michael!
Come on!
Stop those children!
Stop those children!
Aah!
Come with me.
Granny will hide you!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Here, half a mo.
Leave my sister alone.
Your friend won't hurt you.
Bert, it's you.
In the flesh and at your service.
You're filthy.
Perhaps a smudge.
It so happens today
I'm a chimney sweep.
Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.
Don't take on so.
Bert will take care of you.
Like I was your own father.
Who's after you?
Father.
What?
We went to his bank.
We must have done something dreadful.
The police and army were after us.
Michael, don't exaggerate.
There must be some mistake.
Your dad loves you.
No, not with the look he had on his face.
He doesn't like us.
That don't seem likely, does it?
It's true.
Let's sit down.
Begging your pardon, but my heart goes out to your father.
There he is in that cold, heartless bank, hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless money.
I don't like seeing living things caged up.
Father in a cage?
Cages come in all sizes and shapes, even bank-shaped.
Father's not in trouble, we are.
Sure about that, are you?
You've got your mother to look after you, and Mary Poppins and
Constable Jones and me.
Who looks after your father?
When something happens, what does he do?
Fends for himself, he does.
Who does he tell?
No one.
Don't blab his troubles.
He pushes on at his job, uncomplaining, alone, and silent.
He's not very silent.
Michael, be quiet.
Bert, does Father really need our help?
It's not my place to say.
But fathers can always do with a bit of help.
I'll take you home.

I'm dreadfully late.
Yes, mum.
I'll be leaving.
Please stay till Father comes home!
Father will feel better if you shake hands with him.
It's the children, mum.
I thought they were with their father.
You haven't been running off, have you?
They haven't exactly been running away, mum.
They've been frightened and should be looked after.
Oh, of course,
Mary Poppins will...
Oh, no, it's her day off.
Ellen, would you...
No, mum. I haven't done me brasses.
Ask Mrs Brill...
Not for 100 quid.
It's baking day, and you know how cook is.
What about you, sir?
You've been so kind.
Me, mum?
Lord mayor's got a stopped-up chimney.
How clever of you to know.
Our drawing room chimney is in the most ghastly condition.
Thank you so much.
Besides, it will amuse the children.
The lord mayor's going to be terrible put out.
Thank you so much.
I do appreciate it.
I must hurry.
Our gallant ladies in prison are waiting for me to lead them in song.
Good-bye, my darlings.
I choose me bristles with pride, yes, I do
A broom for the shaft
And a brush for the flue
It's awfully dark and gloomy up there.
You see how wrong people can be?
That's a doorway to a place of enchantment.
Up where the smoke is all billowed and curled
'Tween pavement and stars
Is the chimney sweep world
When there's hardly no day
Nor hardly no night
There's things half in shadow
And halfway in light
On the rooftops of London
Coo, what a sight
I wish we could go up there.
I like chimneys.
Rightly so. A chimney is a wondrous thing.
It's built tall up there on the roof.
The wind blows across her top and draws the smoke right up the flue.
Feel the pull on the end of that brush.
It's like you've got a whale at the end of the line, isn't it?
Michael, be careful.
Things happen around fireplaces.
Oh, bother.
Michael!
Michael, come back down here!
Michael, Michael, where are you?
That's a bit awkward.
Stop putting ideas in their heads.
There goes another one.
Shall I go after them?
They can't gallivant up there like kangaroos.
Michael, everything's going to be...
Will you put your things on?
Hurry up. Spit spot.
Thought you'd left.
We didn't mean to.
No harm done.
Truth is, this is a fortuitous circumstance.
Look there.
A trackless jungle just waiting to be explored.
Why not, Mary Poppins?
Oh, please, Mary Poppins.
Oh, well... If we must, we must.
Fall in.
Look lively. Look lively.
Jump to it. Get in line.
Attention!
Slope arms!
Right turn!
Quick march!
Hello there!
It's just good clean soot, Michael.
Far as we go, right?
Not at all.
What did I tell you?
The world's at your feet, and who sees it but the birds, the stars, and the chimney sweeps?
Quite nice, but we've had enough night air. Follow me, please.

Father, every sweep shook your hand.
You'll be so lucky!
Come along, children. Spit spot.
One moment, Mary Poppins.
What's the meaning of this?
I beg your pardon?
Will you explain all this?
I'd like to make one thing clear.
Yes.
I never explain anything.
Yes? Banks here.
Mr Dawes...
I'm dreadfully sorry about what happened today.
I can assure you that...
Tonight, sir?
Yes. We'll expect you at 9:00 precisely.
Without fail.
Without fail.
Why, yes, Banks.
It's extremely serious.
We regret this action.
We regret this action.
You've been with us many years...
You've been with us many years...
As was your father.
As was your father.
Yes, Mr Dawes.
I shall be there at 9:00.
A man has dreams of walking with giants.
To carve his niche in the edifice of time.
Before the mortar of his zeal
Has a chance to congeal
The cup's dashed from his lips.
The flame's snuffed aborning.
He's brought to wrack and ruin in his prime.
Life's a rum go, guv'nor.
That's the truth.
I think it's Mary Poppins.
Since she's come, things have happened to me.
Mary Poppins?
Yes, of course!
My world was calm
Well ordered...
Exemplary.
Then came this person
With chaos in her wake
And now my life's ambitions go
With one fell blow
It's quite a bitter pill
To take
That Poppins woman did it!
I know the person... Mary Poppins.
She's the one what sings...
A spoonful of sugar
That is all it takes
It changes bread and water into
Tea and cakes
That's it exactly!
Changing bread into cakes, indeed.
No wonder everything's higgledy-piggledy.
A spoonful of sugar
Goes a long, long way
Have yourself a healthy helpin'
Every day
A healthy helpin' of trouble.
You know what she did?
I realise it now. She tricked me into taking Jane and
Michael to the bank.
That's how the trouble started.
Tricked you into that?
Outrageous!
A man as important as you?
Shameful!
You're a man of high position, esteemed by your peers.
And when your little tykes are cryin'
You haven't time to dry their tears
And see them grateful little faces
Smilin' up at you
Because their dad
He always knows just what to do
I mean, look...
Like you say, guv'nor...
You've got to grind, grind, grind
At that grindstone
Though childhood slips
Like sand
Through a sieve
And all too soon
They've up and grown
And then they've flown
And it's too late for you to give
Just that spoonful of sugar
To help the medicine
Go down
The medicine go down
Medicine go down
Well, goodbye, guv'nor.
Sorry to have troubled you.
Father.
We're sorry about the tuppence.
We didn't know it would cause you so much trouble.
Here, Father. You can have the tuppence.
Will that make everything all right?
Thank you.
Come in!
Take your hat off, Banks.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Get on with it. Go on.
Yes, Father.
In 1773, an official of this bank unwisely loaned a large sum of money to finance a shipment of tea to the American colonies.
Do you know what happened?
I do. As the ship lay in Boston Harbour, colonists dressed as Red Indians boarded, behaved rudely, and threw the tea overboard.
This made the tea unsuitable for drinking, even for Americans.
Precisely.
The loan was defaulted.
Panic ensued within these walls.
There was a run on the bank.
From that time to this, there has not been a run on this bank.
Until today!
A run, sir, caused by the disgraceful conduct of your son.
Do you deny it?
No, sir.
I shall gladly assume responsibility for my son.
Why are you waiting?
Get on with it.
Yes, Father.
No, not that!
Steady on.
Do you have anything to say?
Sir, they do say that when there's nothing to say, all you can say...
Confound it, Banks!
Do you have anything to say?
Just one word, sir.
Yes?
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
What?
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
Mary Poppins was right.
It does make you feel better.
There's no such word.
It is a perfectly good word.
Do you know what there's no such thing as?
With due respect, there's no such thing as you!
Impertinence, sir!
Would you like to hear a marvellous joke?
A real snapper.
Joke? Snapper?
Jane and Michael meet one day on the street.
Jane says, "I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith."
Michael says, "What's the name of his other leg?"
The man's gone mad.
Call the guard!
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
I'm feeling better!
Don't strike my father!
There's the tuppence, the wonderful, fateful, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious tuppence.
Guard it well. Good-bye!
Where are you going?
I might pop through a chalk pavement picture or seize a horse off a merry-go-round or fly a kite.
Only Poppins knows.
- Poppins?
- My nanny.
She sings that ridiculous song.
A spoonful of sugar
Makes the medicine go down
The medicine go down
The medicine go down
The medicine...
Mad as a March hare.
A wooden leg named Smith.
A wooden leg named Smith.
A wooden le...
Father.
Father!
Father, come down!
Daddy!
Daddy, come back!
Wind's come around, blowing dead on from the west.
She doesn't care what happens to us.
She only promised to stay till the wind changed, right?
Bring my hat stand, please.
Mary Poppins, don't you love us?
What would happen to me if I loved all the children
I said goodbye to?
That's right. George W. Banks,
17 Cherry Tree Lane.
About 6'1", I'd say.
Yes, we rang up his bank first thing.
We discovered he'd been discharged last night.
No telling what he'll do in a fit of despondency.
Wouldn't hurt to drag the river.
There's a spot popular with jumpers.
Really, Ellen!
He seemed to have been a fine, stable gentleman.
No hanky-panky.
Regular habits, as far as anyone knows.
The medicine go down
Just a spoonful...
It's him!
Or something similar.
A little less noise on the premises.
I can't understand the inspector.
Just a spoonful of sugar
Makes the medicine go down
You didn't jump in the river.
How sensible of you.
It's all right, sir.
He's been found.
No, alive, or so I presume.
He's kissing Mrs Banks.
What happened at the bank?
I've been sacked, flung into the street.
A spoonful of sugar
Makes the medicine go down
Gone off his crumpet, that's what he's done.
Dotty as you please.
What were you doing in the cellar?
First, where are the children?
Jane! Michael!
Your father's calling.
It doesn't sound like Father.
Jane! Michael!
Run along. Spit spot.
You won't go,
Mary Poppins, will you?
Spit Spot.
He mended it!
It's wonderful!
However did you manage it?
With tuppence for paper and strings
You can have your own set of wings
With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in flight
With your fist holding tight
To the string of your kite
Oh, oh, oh
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height
Let's go fly a kite
And send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite
A proper kite needs a proper tail.
That's what I said.
Go fly a kite.
No, sir. I don't mean you personally.
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height
Let's go fly a kite
And send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite
When you send it flying up there
All at once you're lighter than air
You can dance on the breeze
Over houses and trees
With your fist holding tight
To the string of your kite
Oh, oh, oh
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height
Let's go fly a kite
And send it soaring
There you are, Banks.
Congratulations.
Capital bit of humour.
"Wooden leg named Smith," or Jones, whatever it was.
Father died laughing.
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
Nonsense. Nothing to be sorry about.
Never seen him happier.
He left an opening for a new partner.
Congratulations.
Thank you very much indeed, sir.
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go
Fly a kite
Awk! That's gratitude for you.
Didn't even say goodbye.
No, they didn't.
Look at them.
They think more of their father than of you.
That's as it should be.
Don't you care?
Practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their thinking.
Is that so?
Mary Poppins, you don't fool me.
Really?
Really. I know how you feel.
If you think I'm keeping my mouth shut...
That will be quite enough, thank you.
Goodbye, Mary Poppins.
Don't stay away too long.
Oh, oh, oh
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height
Let's go fly a kite
And send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go
Fly a kite

PITFALL
Here.
Oh, what are you making?
Hey, I brought food. You eating?
We're coming
It's hot.
It's hot!
It's getting tough, so close to the bedrock.
You think we'll hit pay dirt?
Yeah, I do.
The ground's gettin' nice and sticky.
Is that so?
Well, sticky or not,
I can feel something.
Gramps, if we hit coal, you'll be a big mining boss.
Stop kidding around.
- Look at this.
- What's that?
Smell it!
That's the smell of coal, nice and rich.
Time to eat.
Come over here.
Wash your hands.
There's nothing like white rice.
Sorry I can only pay you in food.
We're out of work anyway.
Besides, if you paid us, we'd owe you if we didn't hit coal.
Want some tea?
You definitely leaving in the morning?
Yeah.
Catching the first bus.
Where are you going?
The boardinghouse in town.
Something'll work out.
The old hick hasn't caught on to us yet.
But he will.
I'm getting out while the getting's good.
Yeah.
I hear there's bounty hunters around looking for deserters like us.
What'd you do that for?
What's it to you?
We could've made dog stew.
You should've told me sooner!
Hey, doggie, come back here.
Come back.
Shit.
He's gone.
Dogs and miners are both better off running away.
Even if I run from here now,
I'll probably just end up at another mine.
Who knows?
Could even be more hellish than the last.
Everyone knows they bait the line.
Give you 1, 000 yen, then eat you up.
A slow tailspin to the depths of hell, where you crash and burn.
What do you wanna be in your next life?
Forget it.
One life's enough for me.
Me, I wanna work somewhere where there's a union.
A union?
Yeah.
Just once...
I'd like to have my say and give my boss a good kick in the ass.
I'd like to be reborn as a demon.
A demon?
Yup.
I'd be reborn in hell anyway, and demons have it easier there.
Yeah.
A demon's a good choice.
Want a caramel, kid?
Take it.
Hey, look!
They're hiring.
Hello?
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
The Marusan warehouse at 8:00.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Stand there like a telephone pole and a dog's gonna piss on you.
Couple of new guys.
Sorry, we don't need any more men.
You came from a mine?
You have any proof of address?
That's all right. I don't need it.
Let's see you jump.
Jump up and down!
Fine.
You're not crippled. We can use you.
Hey!
What's going on?
A deserter.
Next, 280 yen.
Next, 300 yen.
Next, 250 yen.
Hey, you.
Me?
- Come here.
- What is it?
Isn't this your picture?
Looks like it.
But what's it doing here?
Don't worry. It's about a job.
Just follow this map to your new boss.
I'll give him a call about you now.
Is this some kind of trick?
Don't worry. Just be glad it's work.
That's right. You're lucky.
I've got work!
I'm no cripple.
Isn't anyone here?
Hello!
Hello!
There's nobody here.
Hello.
Is that the mailman?
Finally!
Excuse me...
I just wanted to ask directions.
So you're not the mailman?
This is where I want to go.
Let's see now.
You should go that way.
I thought so too.
The map doesn't show a fork in the road.
That must be the hill over there.
What a ghost town.
The mine was closed. They said it could cave in.
The men all ran away in the night.
They owed me 7,000 yen.
That's a tough break.
You can say that again.
Aren't you gonna leave too?
I'm no stray dog. I can't leave with no place to go.
A friend of mine's gonna send for me as soon as he gets himself settled.
Well...
I should get going.
Sorry for the bother.
Stop that!
Thanks.
Why doesn't he write?
Was he lying?
You saw all that, didn't you, ma'am?
It's quite all right.
I'd like to ask for your cooperation.
If the police ask, tell them...
"The killer looked like a miner.
He wore split-toed work boots, so the footprints will be easy to spot.
He threw the knife in the marsh.
Then he came and threatened to kill me if I talked.
Then he left and hurried north.
He looked...
35 or 36.
He had a round face and a bald spot above his right ear. "
That's how it was, right?
Am I dead?
Where the hell did he go?
What did he have against me?
Pops, did you see a guy with white gloves?
Hey.
Little boy.
Lady, did you see a man with white gloves?
Please tell me!
Can't you hear me?
What's the matter?
You can't hear me, can you?
I guess not. I'm dead.
The living can't hear ghosts.
She probably can't see me either.
I guess she can't.
Being invisible might have been useful when I was alive, but this is unbearable.
Lady, I'm telling you, this is really terrible!
Hey! Your daddy's dead!
Go ahead, take it. I paid for it.
Wait for me right there!
Who are these people?
Yes, sir.
He had a round face, and a bald spot right here.
Bald spot?
Right ear?
How big was it?
Well... about this big.
He was dressed like a miner.
Must've been two miners in a brawl.
You bitch!
Why is she spreading these filthy lies?
A quarrel... two miners.
All right.
Give me the details later.
Hey, shut the kid up!
I'm busy right now.
- Did you touch the corpse?
- Of course not.
Hello.
We've got a murder.
Yes, sir.
Here's the information.
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.
This way.
That's the crime scene.
Please go ahead.
I was looking out my window, and I saw them heading in that direction.
They started scuffling, and one was killed.
You were looking from that house?
Get a shot of the whole scene with the body.
Describe the body's position in detail.
The killer ran this way?
Place a marker here.
Careful not to disturb the footprints.
Where shall I stand?
Over there's fine.
Morning. A murder, huh?
Looks that way.
Any leads?
That's what they're looking for.
I heard there's a witness.
- A woman from a candy store.
- I see.
No pictures.
Here... and here.
The fatal wound was to the heart.
Could you pull that up a bit more?
That's fine.
What about there?
- The carotid artery?
- Right here.
Get a shot of this.
- Got it.
- Man, he really got worked over.
Is that your corpse?
You can see me?
Of course. I'm a ghost too.
What happened to you?
A cave-in.
Can't you straighten your neck?
The dead stay forever as they were at death.
Did you eat just before dying?
No, I didn't.
That's really rotten luck.
You'll be starving forever.
Too late now though.
That woman! Why'd she lie like that?
Who cares? It's not worth getting upset about.
They can't nab the killer unless she tells the truth!
The dead only upset themselves by worrying about the living.
Let's go. Forget about them.
I've got to know why!
I wanna see that guy in white gloves get caught and confess.
Why did I have to die?
Why you gotta know that?
I can't rest in peace until I do.
The newly dead all talk like that.
They think it'll let them rest in peace.
But it never works that way.
The more you find out, the deeper the mystery, and the more you suffer.
Give it up. Let's go.
When you die, it's best just to accept the mystery.
But I can't rest in peace until I know!
The new ones all talk like that.
I'm warning you, the more you know, the worse it'll be.
He was the chief of Union
No. 2 at the Hirakawa Mine.
The chief?
This might be a big scoop.
Investigators may be back to search for the knife, so don't let anyone on the property.
This is horrible.
I should move away from here soon.
I'll come around tonight on patrol.
You're a witness, and the killer might come back for revenge.
Let me know if anything happens.
Thank you. I will.
Hello?
Is this Union No. 2 at the Hirakawa Mine?
This is The Nishikuni Times.
Is the chief in?
Yes, the union head.
Is this Mr. Otsuka?
It is? So you're alive?
No, pardon me.
What'd you expect?
It ain't that easy to get a scoop.
Damn, it's hot!
I found it!
What?
The ghost is alive.
Alive?
What do you mean?
He came to the phone in person.
I felt like a fool.
That's impossible! Look at this!
What?
They look almost alike.
No, they look exactly alike.
It's the same guy for sure.
This is no place for a woman on her own.
I've got money.
Now's the time to run.
Horrible...
It's just horrible.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
Hey, what're you doing?
You're a material witness, you know.
I have to get out of here.
I guess you do.
This is no place for a woman alone.
No one else showed up?
Nobody at all.
It's really secluded out here.
It's awful. I can't stand it anymore.
Yeah, you must've been scared.
What's the matter? Come here.
I said come here!
We're all alone.
- What're you doing?
- Don't be shy.
I don't want this. Stop!
What are you doing?
No, don't.
You must be lonely, huh?
Nishikuni Times. We just called.
- What is it?
- We'd like to see the union head.
Hey, you seen the chief?
He's at the dressing plant. I'll get him.
So this is what a union office looks like.
What a huge mine!
You had something more to ask?
Can you spare a moment?
We'd like to hear what you have to say about this.
It looks like me.
Looks like you're asleep.
You're sure it's the chief?
Yeah, must be.
This man is dead.
I'm the one who's dead!
Stabbed in the chest?
Those are bloodstains.
He was stabbed in the side, neck and heart.
- So?
- Do you have any brothers?
No.
And of course this isn't you.
So it's just a chance likeness?
I'd say so.
But what a striking resemblance!
One more picture.
Does this scene look familiar?
Isn't that the abandoned pit at the Takaoka Mine?
That's right.
- You know it?
- Yeah.
We ought to. It's on the way to the New Pit.
I see.
So you've passed by there.
You mean that's where he was killed?
The white line marks the spot.
- When was it?
- Between 7:00 and 8:00 this morning.
It was a trap!
The chief was to pass by there around 8:00 this morning.
He was?
That was the schedule, but we changed it half an hour before leaving.
Then it's reasonable to suspect a trap.
You were the intended victim.
Your plans changed unexpectedly, and your look-alike, who happened to be there, was killed.
Yes, that must be it.
It was no accident!
The police didn't find the map I was carrying!
It must've been a gang.
You mean you have someone in mind?
Someone from Union No. 1, for example?
Yes, that's likely.
Shouldn't you call the police then?
Yes.
But how would we explain it to them?
Just a minute.
I still can't believe it.
They may hate me, but enough to try to kill me?
They'd only be hurting themselves.
You're right.
Maybe it was a warning to anyone defecting to your union.
Yeah! They're fighting to rein in the Old Pit faction.
Old Pit faction?
Our mine has an Old Pit and a New Pit.
We at the Old Pit broke off and organized Union No. 2.
But we've tried not to step on anyone's toes.
I was supposed to visit the New Pit, since eight of their men wanted to join our union.
I was going to stop them.
Stop them? Why?
The guys at the New Pit call us traitors and company stooges.
But it isn't that simple.
Before the split, the New Pit was the mainstay, since we were small.
We had few workers.
We were like a subunit.
We all belonged to the same union, so we pretended to get along.
But then the company moved in to divide and conquer.
It all began like this:
The company decided to lay off some of our men.
The union didn't put up a united front.
The New Pit guys didn't care what happened to us.
That's how the union started to crack in two.
I see.
The company exploited our weakness and took an even tougher stance.
How could we fight back with the New Pit selling us out?
I see your point.
A confrontation between us and the New Pit became inevitable.
I see. But in that case -
Just then the company baited us with the promise not to lay us off if we split off and formed a second union.
Is that ruthless or what?
We debated three full days and nights.
Break off and betray the union, or let them betray us?
We were in tears when we finally decided to split off.
It was hell having to do that to our fellow workers.
But are you saying things aren't tense enough to come to murder?
No, they are!
The New Pit's facing job cuts now.
One wrong move and the union will be split forever. Right?
Yes, it's possible.
By the way, do you know a man with a bald spot above his ear?
- Would that be Toyama?
- Toyama?
Second-in-command at Union No. 1.
I see.
Did Toyama do something?
- He's about to be arrested.
- Arrested?
There's a witness.
A woman, a nearby candy vendor, saw the whole thing.
She told the police the killer had a bald spot above his right ear.
That's bullshit!
I can't believe it.
Chief, you're too trusting.
So it seems Union No. 1 will be disbanded as planned.
Serves 'em right. Violence gets you nowhere in a nation of laws.
- Thanks for your trouble.
- Yes, thanks.
Wait!
You just said "as planned," didn't you?
"As planned"?
Did I say that?
What did you mean?
I don't remember saying that.
A slip of the tongue, I guess.
We have to call the police.
- We can't!
- Why not?
That reporter suspects me.
Of what?
It's a trap.
Soon the police will be suspecting me too.
Why do you say that?
Union No. 1 had nothing to gain from the murder, but we did.
Besides, it's too great a coincidence that a man looking like me was on that road just then.
Yeah.
That seemed odd to me too.
Any fool can see it was a setup.
What about the witness?
That's a good question.
She might've been pressured.
But would they go that far?
Who is it?
Sorry to bother you again.
What is it? Did you forget something?
- Who are you calling?
- Toyama.
Get me the New Pit union office.
Be careful!
It could be a trap.
Union office? Is Mr. Toyama there?
Yes, Toyama.
This is Otsuka of the Old Pit.
Mr. Toyama.
Mr. Otsuka at the Old Pit is calling.
Otsuka?
What the hell?
We have nothing to talk about.
Toyama speaking.
Is this Toyama?
What is it now?
Something urgent has come up.
A reporter just left here for your office.
A reporter?
Why's he coming here?
I don't believe it myself, but you're suspected of murder.
Murder?
Of course I don't believe it for a second.
It can't be.
What murder?
I have an alibi.
I've been with my men day and night since the strike.
Don't waste my time!
Listen, this is serious.
I can't give details over the phone.
There's some terrible plot brewing.
Can't we meet?
No need. My hands are clean.
But there's a witness.
The candy vendor in the ghost town told the police you did it.
What a load of crap!
This "load of crap" is gonna do you in!
Even a tiny leak can sink a ship. DOUBLE-CROSSER
Let's go see her together and get to the bottom of this before it's too late.
All right. Where?
Hold on.
T ell 'em I'm not here.
Don't answer any questions.
What is it?
We're from The Nishikuni
Times, here to see Mr. Toyama.
- What for?
- Isn't he here?
No. We're on strike.
You can't just barge in like this.
This is important.
You want Toyama?
Sorry, but he's out now.
He'll be back in a few hours. Wanna wait?
Fine.
I'm dead.
I'm a ghost.
I'll never know what it says, but it's too late anyway.
What a monster!
How cruel! I did what he told me.
Why'd he kill me?
Filthy rat!
And that cop!
Excuse me! May I have a word?
How am I supposed to answer you?
I'm dead.
Excuse me!
Anyone home?
I'm home all right, but I'm dead.
You better not come in.
Is she out?
You!
It's not my fault! I got killed too. Please forgive me.
Even if I'd refused his money, you'd still be dead, right?
Are you... still alive?
She's dead.
You're alive!
Damn it! I was too late.
I'll say!
You raise a ruckus pretending to be dead, but I'm the one who really got killed!
Why me?
Who could've killed her?
You two were in cahoots!
It's a trap!
Daddy.
Come here.
Hey, stop!
Is that him?
No, it's not.
What's he up to?
He wouldn't answer me anyway.
The union chief!
So it was you!
You let me die for you and then killed the woman!
Vicious scum!
Must a man become a demon just to survive?
Hey! I saw everything!
So it's you!
I saw her.
I had nothing to do with it!
I saw it with my own eyes!
Wait, hear me out.
Listen, will you?
- What for?
It's too late for excuses.
I didn't do it, I tell you!
I don't believe you!
...and then I called you...
Did he kill you?
So... you're dead after all?
I was killed in that guy's place.
We look alike.
Son of a bitch!
No, you've got it all wrong!
Some trap you lured me into!
He's not the one who killed me.
Then who did?
The same guy who killed you.
He came back?
The guy with the white gloves and leather briefcase.
Who the hell is he?
I have no idea.
Then why did you lie for him?
I'm sorry.
I wanted the money.
Well, then... why did he kill you?
I don't have the slightest idea.
He killed me without a word, took the money back, and left.
Who the hell had anything to gain by murdering the likes of me?
Double-crossers like you always have a good story!
Double-crossers?
You're the one who betrayed the Old Pit, a spineless dog who barked when the company told you to.
Fine! We'll let others decide who the real criminal here is!
You stupid shit!
One murder led to another, is that it? You're gonna hang!
We're both gonna hang, you stubborn fool!
Who'll believe nobodies like us?
Murder, huh?
You don't stop at anything, do you?
A great example for our members!
Son of a bitch! Where do you think you're going?
Stop, you bastard!
Stop, damn you!
Come back!
You don't understand a fucking thing!
They're really going at it.
That's some fight.
Fuck you!
UNITE
Who are you?
Why did you kill me?
Tell me!
Who the hell put you up to it?
Why did you kill me?
Who stood to gain from my death?
Exactly as planned.
What's that?
Look here! Tell me!
There has to be a reason to kill a man!
Why did you kill me?
Say something! Speak up!
You have to tell us!
You can't do this, you son of a bitch!
We don't understand!
Why don't you tell us?
Why did you kill me? Who was it for?
I'm so hungry!
Oh, shit!
THE END
Not yet, Colonel.
Wait till you get a clear shot.
You damn fool!
I said wait!
That's not some clay animal in a fairground you're shooting at.
I'm sorry, old man.
I thought I could make it.
[SPEAKS NATIVE LANGUAGE]
What's the matter, Marchent?
It will be dark in an hour.
Can't leave it to suffer all night.
Let's go after it.
- You'd better go back to camp.
- Wouldn't you like me to come with you?
You're dead right I would. I wanted to catch one of the most dangerous animals there is.
Might teach you something.
- Marchent? I realise that while I'm on this safari, I'm your responsibility, but I think I'd like to go.
Whatever the danger.
I'm sorry, Colonel Hammond.
I had no right to shout at you like that.
But the animals in this country are part of my life.
And I hate to see them abused in any way.
You go back to camp.
Your daughter should be arriving tonight.
You must be there to meet her.
All right, David. If you think it's best.
Good luck. See you later.
Right. Come on. Let's hurry.
Release the antelope.
Bwana! Look here.
- We can't be far behind.
- Look!
What is it?
It is the sign of the sacred
White Rhino, that guards the entry into the lands of the Kunaka.
Wait bwana!
You would enter their lands?
Well, we haven't come this far to be turned back by a primitive tree carving.
But here the Devils of Darkness are all about us!
The Deils of waht?
The spirits of the past that protect the forest lands, from the desecration of unworthy eyes.
- They won't come with us?
- They dare not.
And you?
Do you believe in this?
Then wait here.
Malinga. Peace to you.
You are on the hallowed hunting ground of the Kunaka.
No hunter is allowed her.
I only came to end the suffering of this wounded beast.
Your presence has disturbed the spirit of the White Rhinoseros.
He who watches over you would understand.
Can you not also forgive me?
That is for our leaders to decide, but it is written, that whenever the pale ones return, they must die.
Come!
[CHANTS IN NATIVE LANGUAGE]
You who have entered the sacred lands and disturbed the tormented spirits, must die.
- Is there no defence I can offer?
- None.
For your fate was sealed in the dark days of the past, when this area was the domain of the rare White Rhinoseros.
In that time, tribes of the primitive white races came from the far north.
And having no fear of and no respect for our religion, entered this area and senselessly slaughtered the sacred beasts.
Instead of falling upon them and killing them for this sacrilege we of the Kunaka accepted their false idol and entered into a hideous pact with them.
In this, we displeased our gods, who placed us in spiritual bondage, until the White Rhinoseros itself reappears!
Or until the false idol shatters.
Until such time as either of these signs from the god appears, all who enter the sacred land must die!
Don't be afraid.
Let me help you.
I was trying to help her.
Who are you?
The White Rhino.
Your clothes are different. You are different.
Can you speak our tongue?
Yes.
Where do you come from?
A land far from here.
- Why did you come?
- I...
I can only believe the Fates brought me here.
Then they brought you to me!
Take him!
I'm sorry I had to hurt you.
- What is your name?
- They call me Saria.
- Mine is David.
- You came to help us?
If I can.
Tell me something about this place, Saria.
It is our prison...
This room will be yours.
So when we met out there in the jungle, you were trying to escape?
Yes.
But there is no escape from Kari.
We are her slaves.
Slaves?
How long has it been like this?
- For as lomg as I can remember.
- Why not rebel?
You make it sound so easy.
She's not only protected by the timeless ones, but beyond...by the devils.
Devils?
Yes. They are everywhere.
Who are they?
They are our guardians.
They shield us from the cruel world outside.
In return, at each new moon, one of us must wed them.
The bride is never seen again.
It is our fate.
No one must accept such a fate, Saria.
Are there no men here to help you?
- But you said you had come to help us.
- But your men, where are they?
They are no longer men.
Take her!
I did not save you for others, strange one.
You're mine, and mine alone.
Think on this.
Bring the stranger to me.
Now there are two mouths that eat before we get ours!
We are hungry, also!
If you choose to have your food upon the ground, then let it be so.
Now you may eat.
- I will tear the heart from her!
- Now is not the time.
Look at her! She eats upon a throne while we grovel in the dust.
We are not beasts of the field.
We are women, equal to her!
You are wrong.
You are my slaves.
Let her go.
Let the dancing continue.
Permit me, my queen, to speak.
Speak slave.
The women are sad, and when the heart is heavy the feet are not light.
Let there be no more dancing.
You heard my command. Dance!
- You refuse me!
- What else can you expect?
Your heartless cruelty is sickening.
You'd have me otherwise?
What makes you so cruel?
Cruelty has made me cruel.
I was once their slave.
Before the Devils came we dark ones were in bondage to the fair ones.
You would have pitied me then, a meek, cringing creature.
You would have pitied me, but you would not have wanted me.
- I don't want you now.
- Why not?
Must a woman always be subservient to a man to be wanted?
No.
You suggest we should be equals?
Yes.
Then I offer you equality.
Share my throne and my kingdom with me.
If you abandon the harshness of your regime, yes, I could accept your offer.
You see!
Already you want to impose your will!
You want to dominate me.
I'd be a fool to let any man do that again.
But you will want me- and on my terms1
Never.
I am queen here.
I will not be denied.
You will never rule me.
Then like the others, you will become my slave.
Take him!
Tomorrow you will learn what happens to those who try to master me.
A devil!
Poor Saria. She's too young to have sufferred so.
The let this be your lesson.
Many more of us will have to suffer if you persist in this seneless search for freedom..
There is no escape.
Lie still, little one.
- Is he safe? Have they hurt him?
- Who?
The stranger.
The one that came to help us.
Don't expect too much from him.
Kari has taken him for her own.
He has not resisted.
I don't believe you.
He wouldn't betray me.
Do you still refuse me?
Let us see what a visit in there will do to weaken your resolve.
You- on the bellows!
Who are you? Where are you from?
How did you come here?
Silence, you senile old fool.
The sooner you join your ancestors and your stupid tongue is silenced forever, the happier I shall be!
Work!
- He hates yoy. Why?
- The man he used to hate died last week.
He needs someone new.
They all hate.
It keeps them alive.
- You do not hate?
- I am too old.
Even for hatred.
Silence! Quiet!
Work.
Let the ceremony of selection begin.
It won't help.
The selection has been made.
The bride will be...
Amyak!
No!
Do not look upon us with such disgust.
We too were once a civilised people.
It's hard to believe now.
It was so when we first came to the sacred land of the White Rhinoseros.
Even where I have come from,
I have heard much of this legend.
Tell me, how did it begin?
Our forefather's brought us here.
We were not superstitious like the others.
We hunted the White Rhinoseros until it finally became extinct.
Then we erected a false image to make others believe that it still lived.
In this way we offended the gods, and the legend was born.
They sent us a tribe of dark people, who came here looking for sanctuary.
For our protection...
They were less intelligent people, and instead of nurturing them, we made them our slaves.
This easing of our daily burden made us soft and thoughtless to the well-being of others.
One day, a young slave girl escaped.
She went to the most barbaric of the neighbouring tribes, those who call themselves the
'Devils of Darkness'.
She betrayed our secrets.
No longer fearing the spirit of the
White Rhinoseros, the devils fell upon us.
Our women were enslaved.
The men put in here... and that young slave girl was made our queen.
A more evil woman could not have been chosen.
How could she know better?
The evil within her was put there by us!
Our own selfishness and greed had grown tenfold on fertile soil, and had turned against us.
These false doctrines that we have created will be washed from the minds of men.
No. You're wrong.
The legend will not die.
Then we can only pray for the forgiveness of the gods.
For the legend is that we must all remain in spiritual bondage,
Until the White Rhino itself reappears, and the false idol rent asunder.
They must not take Amyak away from us now.
- We must rebel.
- Let us rise up.
Without Amyak, we are lost.
- She is our leader...
- No!
You must take no action!
You're not ready yet.
You must only choose a new leader.
Let Saria lead you after I am gone.
Any form of resistence means death.
- Then you won't join us?
- We must all be bride someday.
It si our destiny.
Only the gods can change one's destiny, and you are not gods.
We must go to the stranger.
He will help us.
How can he help you, little one?
He's imprisoned with the other men.
- He's not like other men.
- To you he isn't.
He's not like other men, and it is Kari who desires him!
If he were to become her man, he could use his position in helping us destroy her.
And could you agree to allowing this stranger to become- Kari's man?
I must agree, for all our sakes.
- Are you not afraid?
- Yes, little one. I am afraid.
- Don't wake the others.
- Why are you here?
The women are ready to rebel, but we need your help.
How can I help?
Kari must be watched by somebody close to her.
- You could be that person.
- Me?
It is known that you have refused her, but, if you would change your mind?
- Do you know what you're asking?
- Yes.
Yes, I know what, but you must help us.
Please, promise me that you will.
How can I refuse you?
Don't be sad.
When this is over, we'll be together.
No, when this is over, you will leave us.
I will never leave you.
The legend foretells, that when the stranger comes to free us, and his task is done, he will return to his own land... alone.
I won't leave you.
I must go.
That woman... is she your special woman?
Yes.
I had forgotten about such things.
- On my terms, completely?
- Yes.
- You will run my household?
- Yes.
- Look after my clothing?
- Yes.
- Mix my perfumes?
- Yes.
In fact you will do everything that I ask?
Yes.
Fetch me my robe.
Why do you hesitate?
It will take me a little time to...
You must learn that each command must be obeyed at once.
Come.
My body hungers.
Bring food and drink to my chambers.
No!
I release you from your promise.
What promise?
There is no promise.
He fulfills your desires only because
I made him promise that he would.
Is this true?
She is confused.
She doesn't know what she is saying.
- Is it true?
- He did it for all our sakes!
Take him to the cavern, and never let him see daylight again!
Never! Never! Never!
Bring her!
Never! Never! Never! Never!
Look at her. Look!
For you'll never see her again.
Never! Never!
The Devils are here.
They've come for a bride.
Why did you stop him?
I couldn't bear to see him humiliated any more.
And yet to save him you've condemned yourself- and us.
While he and the other men still live, you must not lose hope.
The men! What use are they?
Better they were dead.
They've become beasts.
You must think of the men, not as enemies, but as friends.
Then together you will conquer.
It is the only way.
No! Nobody can stand it!
He's right.
Pain won't last long.
Let us try again.
- You must stop!
- No!
Not until we are free.
Are we free?
Yes.
The gods are kind.
My one prayer was to die free.
Am I free?
I... I am free!
I am...free.
Quickly! There is work to be done!
After them!
Victory is ours. Stop!
You don't have the time to go in there!.
The jungle is their home.
- Kill her!
- After them!
Kill them all! They dare to rebel against me! Kill them all!
Kill them all!
- David! David!
-Saria!
Look!
Stop!
He is our god.
He will not harm us.
We won't need them any more.
You don't think they'll come back?
No. The legend...
It's partly fulfilled.
I don't care what the legend says.
I won't leave you.
My world is not yours.
This much I understand.
- How can you know that?
- You came to help us and your task is finished.
And now you must leave.
Saria!
Are we never to be together?
Not until the gods who watch over us wish it to be so.
I love you.
And my love for you will last forever.
It is fulfilled.
The legend of the White Rhinoseros is fulfilled!
At last we are free.
Our souls are no longer in bondage.
We are free!
Free! We are free! Free!
Our gods chose you to free us from this burden that has tormented us through the ages.
The Kunaka will be eternally grateful.
The temple of the false idol must be destroyed!
What happened, bwana,
I thought you were in danger?
- Jakara, how long was I in there?
- Only for one moment.
One moment...
What happened?
I'm not sure.
There was a sheet of lightning.
What has happened to them?
They are not as fierce a tribe as you would have me believe, Jakara.
I think it safer we get back to camp.
Pity David didn't get that leopard, m'dear.
The skin would have made a nice present for our daughter.
John... Did you notice anything strange about Mr. Marcheant when he came back?
Can't say I did. Why?
He had a sort of farawy look in his eye.
- Almost as if he...
- Excuse me, bwana.
- The others are coming.
- Splendid. Tell Mr. Marchent.
Wonder if they've got some
English newspapers.
The others have come, bwana.
Thank you.
I'll be out in a moment.
John!
- David.
- Hello. Good journey?
Fine, David. Fine.
Hope I haven't missed any excitement here?
No. Not really.
Come on then.
Come and meet the new people.
Mr. and Mrs Perkins, from London.
Mrs. Perkins. Mr. Perkins.
And Mr. Peter O'Donnell.
Mr. O'Donnell.
Please make yourselves at home.
My head boy will show you the sleeping arrangements.
There's another one here, somewhere.
Ah, there she is.
Oh, Sarah, I'd like you to meet
Mr. David Marchent.

(BOTH IMITATING
CAR ENGINE)
Hang on, we're coming to a bend.
You're going too fast!
No, I'm not. Hang on!
What's this heap of old iron doing here?
Old iron?
I'll give you
10 bob for it.
Don't be daft.
This was once a great car.
Won the Grand Prix three years running.
So it's a car, is it?
Certainly it's a car.
It's a racing car.
And we're winning.
And you're in the way.
And you're in the way for a right belt around the ear, young man, if I have any more of your lip.
All right.
I'll give you
15 bob for it.
Make it 30 bob, and she's yours.
Mr. Coggins, you're not going to sell her, are you?
Of course he's gonna sell her.
What do you think he's running here, a children's playground or something?
All right, 30 bob.
I'll pick her up Wednesday.
But, Mr. Coggins, you promised we could play in her.
Well, I'm sorry, my dears, but she ain't any use to me.
Times are hard.
But you can't take her away.
She's not just any old car.
She's ours.
Not anymore, she ain't.
I'll see you tomorrow, Bill.
Giddy-up!
What're you going to do with her?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do with her, we're gonna put her in the clapper and we're gonna crunch her up till she's one solid piece of metal.
Then we're gonna put her in a fiery furnace, and we're gonna melt her down till she's liquid iron.
That's what we're gonna do with her.
Now look what you've done.
You've frightened her.
She shivered.
See? She's a very special car.
If you put her in the fiery furnace, you'll be guilty of murder.
Yeah, and if you don't get out of it,
I'll be guilty of two more murders.
Now go on, out of it.
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!
Please, Mr. Coggins, you can't sell our lovely car to that nasty man.
Well, I'm sorry, children, but I'm afraid
I already have.
I know!
Daddy will buy it for us.
Won't he, Jemima?
Of course he will.
Mr. Coggins, promise you won't let her go until we come back.
Well, 30 shillings, mind.
Not a penny less.
Please promise.
Please.
All right, I promise.
Come on, Jemima.
Well, that's a clever thing to do!
We're very sorry, miss.
I'm sure you are.
Well, just look at my car.
And just look what a mess I'm in, too.
Oh, no, I think you're beautiful.
And I like your car.
Hmm.
Just the same, you shouldn't be rushing across the road like that.
You know, you might have been killed.
Anyway, why aren't you in school?
It isn't a holiday, is it?
No, miss.
Do you live around here?
Yes, we live just down the road.
Come on, get into my car,
I'm taking you home.
Gosh, just wait till
Daddy hears we've been for a ride in a motorcar!
Yes!
What's your name?
I'm Jemima.
And I'm Jeremy.
What's yours?
Truly.
That's a very pretty name.
Now, where is your house?
Oh, we don't live in a house.
We live in the castle on top of the hill.
A castle? I didn't know there were any castles around here.
Well, it isn't a castle exactly.
That's what
Daddy calls it.
He says King Alfred used to live there hundreds of years ago.
And does your daddy know you aren't in school?
Oh, he won't mind.
He never does.
Anyway, he's awfully busy.
Is he?
Well, he'll have to find time to see me, because I have a few things to say to him.
JEMlMA: Edison! Edison!
JEREMY: Come here, boy!
Good boy, good boy.
That's Daddy over there.
JEMlMA: Hello!
JEREMY: Hello!
Hello.
You're just in time.
What on earth is he up to?
JEMlMA: That's his latest invention.
Rockets.
Rockets?
Stand back!
Keep clear!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Does he know what he's doing?
Of course he does.
Whoa!
Well, I don't see anything funny.
Somebody should do something about it.
Hold on! Hold on!
Wait! Wait there.
Oh!
Thank you!
I should hope so.
You might have gone up in flames.
Madam, I took that into consideration.
This suit is completely flameproof.
Oh, dear.
You have just succeeded in ruining my propulsion unit.
But how was l to know that you were. . .
Don't be cross with the lady, Daddy.
JEREMY: She gave us a ride in her car.
JEMlMA: She was only trying to help.
How very kind.
Her name's Truly.
That's nice.
Do you realize,
Mr. Potts, that I nearly knocked down your two children?
Well, we do seem to be accident-prone, don't we?
But it wasn't my fault.
You see, they came rushing out. . .
Oh, well, it was very, very nice of you to apologize.
Apologize?
Tea time, children.
Bye-bye, Truly.
Thanks for the ride.
Just a moment, you two.
Don't you have something to tell your father?
Yes, we have.
Daddy, Mr. Coggins promised us. . .
But she didn't mean about that.
Daddy, we didn't go to school today.
Oh-ho.
Well, it'll give the other children a chance to catch up, won't it?
Run along, children.
Goodbye.
Goodbye. Bye, Truly.
Come on, Edison.
But, Mr. Potts. . .
Good day!
But, but. . .
Unstable.
Definitely unstable.
Good afternoon, miss.
Sorry I can't stop.
I'm off to India.
Going to have a cup of tea with the Maharajah. Cheerio!
Mr. Potts.
I'm sorry to persist about this, but perhaps you simply aren't aware that your children were running about in the road.
And after all, you know, it's not a playground.
It's very. . .
Would you mind just pressing that switch there?
Switch?
Yes, just behind you.
On the right.
The right.
The right?
Thank you.
You really ought to try and exercise more control over them.
Yes, I suppose I could chain them up, couldn't l?
On a nice long chain, of course, so they get plenty of exercise.
Mr. Potts, don't your children go to school?
Oh, I have it now.
You're the truant officer.
No, I'm not the truant officer.
Well, didn't you ever play truant?
I mean, just once?
No, I most certainly did not.
I bet you didn't.
Would it be too much to ask what this is, this, um, thing?
A little invention of mine, cleans carpets by suction.
All that to clean carpets?
Away with sweeping, and away with brushing, and away with dirty carpets.
Is that all you do,
Mr. Potts? Invent things?
Is that all I do?
And what's this gadget?
Well, that's not quite right yet, but eventually,
I hope to transmit moving pictures by wireless.
Oh, really?
Yes, really.
That's my. . .
And this?
This, madam, is a sweet-making machine.
And is this one of the sweets?
Yes, it is.
And is it supposed to have all those holes in it?
No. Actually, I think that the problem is. . .
The boiling point of your sugar is too high.
Oh, we're an expert on sweet-making, are we?
Well, as a matter of fact. . .
And an expert on child welfare.
I was only trying to help your children.
Well, maybe my children like running wild in the street.
Did that ever occur to you?
I do not see any cause to. . .
And in any case, how my children behave is frankly no concern of yours.
I was merely trying. . .
So, if you'll be so good as to take yourself off in that fancy automobile of yours and go do good somewhere else.
Well, I've never been. . .
Spoken to that way before?
Well, maybe it's about time.
Good afternoon, madam.
Mind the cable!
Vicious, interfering. . .
If women are going to drive motorcars around, they should learn to operate one correctly.
Well, I suppose it wouldn't occur to you to offer to help me.
Get in the car. Please.
Well, for a mechanically-minded man,
Mr. Potts. . .
Try switching it on.
Oh.
Hmm!
Open the throttle!
And keep it open!
Women!
Confounded woman!
Who does she think she is?
Coming in here and telling me how to raise my children.
Do I need somebody to tell me how to raise my children?
Do l? Hmm?
No, of course not.
Of course not!
Where's my cardigan?
Under your jacket.
Under. . . Yes.
Self-righteous busybody.
She won't be bothering us again.
But I liked her.
So did l.
She was very pretty.
She certainly was.
Do you think your father's a crackpot?
Your cardigan's inside out.
Oh.
Do you think
I'm a lunatic, wasting my time on a lot of silly inventions?
But they aren't silly.
They're wonderful.
Nobody else could think of them.
That's right. That is right.
Nobody else could think of them.
Yes. After all, what makes the battle worth the fighting?
What makes the mountain worth the climb?
What makes the questions worth the asking?
The reason worth the rhyme?
(SINGING) To me, the answer's clear
It's having someone near
Someone dear
Someone to care for
To be there for
I have you two
Someone to do for
Muddle through for
I have you two
Someone to share joy or despair with
Whichever betides you
Life becomes a chore
Unless you're living for
Someone to tend to, be a friend to
I have you two
Someone to strive for
Do or die for
I have you two
Could be we three get along so famously
'Cause you two have me
And I have you two, too
BOTH: Someone to care for
To be there for
I have you two
Someone to do for
Muddle through for
I have you two
Someone to smile once in a while with
Whenever you're lonesome
I've a happy lot
Considering what I've got
But I couldn't do more
Than you do for your poor father
Daddy!
Daddy!
Things go asunder
And I wonder why you bother
ALL: Could be we three
Get along so famously 'cause
BOTH: We two have you
And I have you two
Too
Jeremy.
Oh, good.
Do I smell food?
Bring the bread, will you, Grandpa.
Yes, sir! Sir! Sir!
And pepper and salt, please.
Right away, sir!
Oh!
Sausage and egg, my favorite!
How was India?
India?
I'll tell you something.
I got up this morning, and I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
How he ever. . .
ALL: Got into my pajamas,
I shall never know.
You've heard it before.
Now, I wonder how that could have happened.
Daddy, could we ask you something?
It's about Mr. Coggins.
Mr. Coggins.
You see, the junkman wanted to take it away.
But Mr. Coggins says if we asked you first. . .
Asked me what first?
He's a horrid, mean, old man.
Mr. Coggins?
No, the junkman.
He's going to take it away and put it in a furnace.
And burn it all up.
It's terrible.
What are you going on about?
BOTH: Our car!
Yes, well, what about it?
Mr. Coggins is selling it to the junkman.
And the junkman's going to put it in the fiery furnace.
And squidge it all up till there's nothing left.
Oh, well, that's terrible.
That is terrible.
We can't let that happen, Grandpa.
No, definitely not.
We knew you wouldn't let them, Daddy.
So we made Mr.
Coggins promise we could have it if you gave him
30 shillings.
Uh, 30 shillings.
JEREMY: You can give
Mr. Coggins the money in the morning, Daddy.
Yes, well, I suppose we can work something out somehow.
Good!
Hooray!
Are you all finished?
Yes, Daddy.
Yes, thank you.
Well, I think, maybe, you should go run up to bed.
Good night, Grandpa.
Good night, my boy.
Sleep tight.
Good night, Grandpa.
Good night, my darling.
God bless you.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night.
Good night, Daddy.
Yes, well, you've done it now, haven't you?
You think Coggins might do a deal?
So much a week?
Coggins? What, him down the road? Sure.
He's so mean he wouldn't light your pipe if his house was on fire.
Did you hear that?
You know what that means, don't you?
I'll be up all night, rain pouring through my bedroom roof.
Grandpa, why don't you sleep in the workshop?
It's nice and. . .
The workshop?
You promised, faithfully, to fix my bedroom roof.
I will, Grandpa.
It's just. . .
Caractacus, please.
My boy, listen.
It's time you woke up.
When I was your age,
I did a day's work. . .
For a day's pay, polishing the Colonel's boots.
I was the smartest batman in the British Army.
So you've been telling me.
When my Brigadier went into action, the fuzzy-wuzzies were so blinded by the shine on his boots, they couldn't see to fight.
Catch me death of cold.
He doesn't care.
Nobody cares.
Me own son!
She was right.
Who wants sweets with holes in them?
Oh, Edison, stop that whistling.
Edison, hey, do that again.
Edison, you're a genius.
The employment office is in the rear.
Thank you. Oh.
You see, I've invented these sweets.
Really?
Name?
Uh. . .
Whistling Sweets.
Mr. Whistling Sweets.
Not Mr. Whistling Sweets.
No, I'm Potts.
Hmm.
May I see the managing director?
Lord Scrumptious sees no one without an appointment.
CARACTACUS: Well, how do l get an appointment?
Why, hello, children.
JEMlMA: Jeremy, it's Truly.
Hello, Truly.
Good morning,
Miss Scrumptious.
How nice to see you.
Good morning, Phillips.
Please tell my father that I'm here.
But of course,
Miss Scrumptious.
Are you here on business, Mr. Potts?
Yes, Miss. . .
Father?
Truly Scrumptious.
You're his. . .
His daughter.
Mmm-hmm.
Come on, children, let's go.
But, Daddy, you haven't shown anybody your invention.
Somehow, I don't think that'll do much good.
Just a moment,
Mr. Potts.
Exactly what was it you. . .
You've seen them.
Oh, those.
But they whistle.
Whistle?
Those holes.
You just blow through them.
They're very ingenious.
Kind of a novelty.
Please go in,
Miss Scrumptious.
You can come back in three weeks' time.
Show Mr. Potts in,
Phillips.
Now?
Now.
But his Lordship said. . .
Now.
Very well.
Please follow me.
Maybe I should come back in three weeks.
Oh, Daddy!
Go on, Daddy.
All right.
And don't let him bully you.
Yes.
Mr. Potts, milord.
Potts? Who's he?
Where's me daughter?
She insisted on
Mr. Potts seeing you.
All right, don't just stand there.
What's it all about?
Sweets, sir.
I hardly thought it was nuts and bolts.
Let's have a look.
Yes.
Hurry up, man!
Yes, sir.
If I may be allowed to explain, sir.
You have exactly
20 seconds.
Yes.
Well, the fundamental novelty of these particular sweets is their musical quality.
Not only are they remarkably tasty, but due to the unique positioning of these little holes, they are capable, when blown through, of rendering a tuneful whistle.
Place your fingers over the holes and blow thus.
Tasting time, milord.
Too late. Had your chance.
Muffed it. Good morning.
Go on. Follow him.
Milord?
CARACTACUS: Sir?
Excuse me.
Sir, if I may be allowed to demonstrate.
You see, by blowing air through this hole in the center of the sweet you get a wonderful-sounding. . .
Raspberry?
No, no.
It's more like a toot, really.
Not enough fruit, too much sugar.
Yes, milord.
Prepare the peppermint.
Beautiful. Would you care to try it, sir?
Under no circumstances.
Prepare the lemon!
He's not doing very well, is he?
You know, another remarkable feature about these little sweets is that by sucking on them. . .
Throw it away!
Will you get rid of this idiot for me?
Milord. You.
. . .in perfect pitch.
They also come in strawberry, raspberry. . .
Are you still here?
. . .lemon and. . .
And pineapple.
(MOUTHING) Go on.
Don't waste your pucker on some all-day sucker.
And don't try a toffee or cream.
If you seek perfection in sugar confection, well, there's something new on the scene.
A mouthful of cheer, a sweet without peer.
A musical morsel supreme
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The candies you whistle
The whistles you eat
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The eatable, tweetable treats
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The toot of a flute with the flavor of fruit
Toot sweets, toot sweets
No longer need candy be mute
Don't waste your pucker on some all-day sucker
And don't try a toffee or cream
If you seek perfection in sugar confection
Well, there's something new on the scene
That mouthful of cheer
That sweet without peer
That musical morsel supreme
That musical morsel supreme
BOTH: Toot sweets, toot sweets
A bonbon to blow on at last has been found
Toot sweets, toot sweets
With tweetable, eatable sound
No! Take it away!
Father, please.
He likes it!
(SINGING) Their value is intrinsic
Surpass any mint stick
BOTH: Or marshmallow mouthful you munch
Though licorice is chewy
And gumdrops are gooey
And chocolate is charming to crunch
That savory fife
That sweet of your life
It's clearly the best of the bunch
Toot sweets, toot sweets
That savory fife
That sweet of your life
Is clearly the best of the bunch
Toot sweets, toot sweets
A bonbon to blow on at last has been found
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The treat that's so tweetable
Lusciously eatable
With that unbeatable
Sound
Get out of here!
Go away!
What's going on?
Get those dogs out of here!
Edison, no!
Edison! Edison!
Children!
JEMlMA: Edison!
Edison!
It's entirely your fault.
I'll send for the police.
Daddy.
Now, why aren't you two asleep?
Don't be sad,
Daddy.
It wasn't your fault.
It was all those mean, old dogs.
Children, about the car. . .
You see,
30 shillings is pretty hard to come by.
And when I do get any money,
I need it for my inventions.
Well, there isn't any left.
Jeremy and l have been thinking.
It's our treasure chest.
These things are enormously valuable.
Look, an ivory tusk.
JEREMY: That must be worth a fortune.
JEMlMA: And diamonds.
And a golden crown.
It's probably
King Alfred's.
Of course, it needs cleaning up a little.
Take them, Daddy.
You can sell them.
And never mind about the car.
You can spend it all on your inventions.
Thank you, children.
All these wonderful things, they're very precious.
But I'm afraid other people wouldn't appreciate them.
Why not, Daddy?
Because other people don't see things the way you do.
Come on, now.
Let's go to bed.
And don't you worry.
Things are going to come right somehow.
(SINGING) A gentle breeze from Hushabye Mountain
Softly blows o'er Lullaby Bay
It fills the sails of boats that are waiting
Waiting to sail your worries away
It isn't far to Hushabye Mountain
And your boat waits down by the quay
The winds of night so softly are sighing
Soon they will fly your troubles to sea
So close your eyes on Hushabye Mountain
Wave goodbye to cares of the day
And watch your boat from Hushabye Mountain
Sail far away from Lullaby Bay
(CIRCUS MARCH
PLAYlNG DlSTANTLY)
All the lovely colors.
Two for the price of one.
Get your balloons here!
MAN: Hurry, hurry, hurry along now.
Don't miss these lovely toffee apples!
Hurry along now!
Get your toffee apples at 8p each.
Thank you very much, young man.
Any more for any more?
Which one of you lovely ladies and gentlemen would like a splendid, automatic haircut?
I've stood in this marketplace for 25 years.
I do not profess to make dead men talk!
(LOUDLY) Hey, now, here you go then. Who's for an automatic haircut?
Only three pence a time.
You may have long hair, you may have short hair, sir, you may have straight hair, it makes no difference to the Potts automatic and hygienic, electronic hair-cutting machine!
Come on.
You could do with a haircut.
Cut me hair?
That's where me strength is.
Excuse me, sir, you look like a man who could do with a haircut.
Bah!
Yeah, go on! Go on.
Come on, sit down.
Hold that, then.
My word, you have a lot of hair.
Would you like an estimate, sir?
Very funny.
Go on, get on with it.
You just sit tight, sir, while I lower this hair-cutting machine.
There we are.
You just relax, we'll have you finished in a bit.
I feel like a real right nana sitting here.
No, you look lovely, Cyril.
It's going to be smashing.
You keep your eyes on that geezer.
Yeah, all right, then.
What's going on?
It's all right,
Cyril, it's all right.
Nothing to worry about, sir, a little friction to start.
It tickles!
Oh, you always say that, Cyril.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Cyril, you're smoking!
I'm on fire!
Stop it!
Oh!
Excuse me!
Me head's on fire!
It's all right, sir.
What you done?
Give me a mirror.
Let's have a look.
A mirror?
I'll go home and get you one.
Me hair! Look at me hair!
Where is he?
I'll kill him!
There he is, mister!
Cyril!
I'll smash your teeth down your throat!
You!
Come on, you're too fat to catch him!
Oi! Big bonce!
Get out of here.
There he is!
Get out of my way!
Oi!
Here, hurry up.
We're on.
Get out of the way!
Get out of it!
(SINGING) A gentleman's got a walking stick
A seaman's got a gaff
And the merry men of Robin Hood
They used a quarterstaff
On the Spanish plains, inside their canes
They hide their ruddy swords
But we make do with an old bamboo
And everyone applauds
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Me old bamboo, me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother with me old bamboo
When punting on the beautiful Thames
You use a sturdy pole
To protect their fair complexion
Ladies use a parasol
It's useful in the underbrush
To have a hefty spear
Right!
But what we do with an old bamboo
Makes everybody cheer
One, two, three
Me old bamboo, me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother with me old bamboo
Have a go, mate!
A flier in an aerial plane
He steers it with a stick
He does?
A collier in the pits of Wales
He leans upon his pick
That's right
Now every wheel of an automobile
Revolves around a shaft
But what we do with an old bamboo
Makes everyone go daft
And one, two
Me old bamboo, me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother with me old bamboo
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
And a-one, two, three, four
And a-five and six and seven
Me old bamboo, me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother with me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
Thank you.
Here, thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
CHlLDREN: It's Daddy!
It's Daddy! He's got the car!
Look! I've got it!
He's got the car!
He's got the car!
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Hello!
BOTH: The car!
What do you think of this?
Isn't she a beauty?
Oh, Daddy! Oh!
That's a nice pile of junk you got there, my boy.
Well, it needs a little work, but there's a fine engine under here.
GRANDPA: It doesn't go, though, does it?
No, not yet, but it will. It will.
You can make it go, can't you, Daddy?
Well, I'm gonna give it a try.
All right, come on, everybody, put a hand to the wheel.
George, give us a hand here, will you?
Yes, sir.
Okay, heave!
JEMlMA: We're off!
We're off! Hooray!
Comfortable, Grandpa?
Won't work, of course.
Another catastrophe.
Left hand down.
JEREMY: Come on,
Grandpa, push!
Watch it, Jeremy.
Mind the bicycle.
JEMlMA: Push.
Good. Keep coming, Jeremy.
That's it. Keep coming.
Look out, Edison.
Watch out, Edison.
Look out, Edison.
That's it.
Keep coming.
Good. Whoa! That's it.
Whoa!
All right, governor.
Many, many thanks, George.
Right.
Now. . .
Can we stay and watch, Daddy?
Yes!
No, come on, my dears, we'd better go.
You know what your dad's like when he's working.
JEMlMA: But, Grandpa, we wanted to stay and watch.
GRANDPA: Come back in the house, darling.
I'll make you a nice cup of tea.
Don't overdo it, will you, my boy?
Right, Grandpa.
You might exhaust yourself.
Come on!
"And the big brown bear
"came lolloping over the mountain.
"'No, no,' the princess cried.
"And the big brown bear came lolloping over the mountain."
It's awfully quiet in there.
Come on, children, breakfast is ready.
He's been there for days!
Will you please come and have your breakfast?
But Daddy said the car would be finished today.
Darling, you'll be waiting a month of Sundays before he's finished that.
Come on.
Be good children.
Come on.
That's Daddy!
The car.
He's finished the car!
Gosh!
Oh!
Well, what do you think of her?
JEMIMA: She's the most beautiful thing
I ever saw in my life!
It's wonderful! Oh, Daddy, you're so clever.
Oh, yes.
Can we go for a drive?
For a drive?
A drive. A drive.
I have a better idea.
How about a picnic?
BOTH: Hooray!
A picnic! A picnic.
All right?
Let's get cracking.
You get the basket out of the workshop.
Get in, Jemima.
Hooray! Hooray!
Hurry! Mind the woodwork.
Mind the woodwork.
Don't touch.
Don't touch the horn.
Here's the basket, Daddy.
Oh, yes.
Just put it on the back.
All right.
Now. Don't touch that.
BOTH: Grandfather! Come on.
We're going on a picnic.
Get aboard, Grandpa.
Come on, come on.
It'll never go, my dears.
Not if he's had anything to do with it.
But it is going!
Hooray!
Then it'll never stop.
Anyway, it's far too hot.
Where are you going?
Me? I'm off to Alaska, me boy. Cheerio!
BOTH: Goodbye, Grandpa!
Come on, Daddy!
All right.
Come on!
Come on!
We're off!
Hooray!
We're off! We're off!
Sit down, Jemima, sit down.
Are you ready?
Yes!
Here we go!
Hooray!
Mind your back, Grandpa.
Bye, Grandpa.
Nasty, smelly things, motorcars!
What a funny noise it's making!
It's talking to us.
All engines talk.
What's it saying?
It's saying, chitty, chitty, chitty, chitty.

You'll find a slight squeeze on the hooter an excellent safety precaution,
Miss Scrumptious.
Never mind about that.
How am I supposed to get out of here?
Well, looks to me as if you have to walk.
Or swim.
What? In this dress?
Oh, don't be ridiculous,
Mr. Potts.
Come on.
(STAMMERING) What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna carry you.
Oh, dear, must you?
Well, unless you'd rather ride piggyback.
All right.
You may carry me.
Good.
Wait, wait, wait.
My handbag. Oh!
Whoa! Oh!
It's all right.
Thank you.
Not at all.
We're going to the seaside.
On a picnic.
Come with us.
Please.
Well, I'm hardly in the mood for a picnic just now.
Well, you needn't worry about your car.
I can have Mr. Coggins tow it out.
Well, I. . .
We've got sausage tarts.
And marmalade rolls.
I'm afraid I got 'em a little mixed up.
What an unusual car.
Daddy made it.
Oh. And it actually goes?
It's called
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
That's a curious name for a motorcar.
But that's the sound it makes.
Listen.

I'm so glad you came.
It's much more fun with two grownups.
Truly Scrumptious.
You know, even if we didn't know your name, we could have guessed it.
Oh?
You had to be called something lovely.
Like Yum Yum!
Or Angel Cake.
Or Toot Sweets.
Yes. Toot Sweets.
(LAUGHS) Toot Sweets?
Oh, no.
(SINGING) Toot sweets sound like what they are
So do lollies in a lollipop jar
Gingerbread men have a gingerbread sound
We've found
Sugarplum, cinnamon, and lemon tart
Tell you what they are right from the start
And your name does the same for you
By coincidence,
Truly Scrumptious
You're truly, truly scrumptious
Scrumptious as a cherry peach parfait
When you're near us
It's so delicious
Honest, Truly
You're the answer to our wishes
Truly Scrumptious
Though we may seem presumptuous
Never, never ever go away
Our hearts beat so unruly
Because we love you truly
Aw!
Honest, Truly
We do
CHlLDREN: Daddy! Daddy!
Boo!

You two are truly scrumptious
Scrumptious as the breeze across the bay

You two are truly scrumptious
And I shan't forget this lovely day
My heart beats so unruly
I also love you truly
Honest, truly
I do
Come on.
Hey, wait for me!
Mr. Potts.
Somebody call?
Oh. (GROANS)
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.
That's all right.
What are you doing?
Oh, just tinkering.
Oh.
You know, Mr. Potts, you have two wonderful children.
Why, thank you.
I must agree with you there.
Isn't it beautiful?
Lovely. Just lovely.
Jeremy, it's not nice to peek.
I'm not peeking,
I'm looking.
Do you think they like each other?
Of course they do.
Do you think they're going to get married?
Has he kissed her yet?
Not yet.
Well, just as soon as he kisses her then they'll have to get married.
JEMIMA: Jeremy, what are you doing?
JEREMY: I'm keeping a lookout for pirates.
There aren't any pirates around here, are there, Truly?
Oh, I'm sure there are.
Hundreds of them.
'Course there are.
This is where they bury their treasure, isn't it, Daddy?
Mmm-hmm.
Tell us a story about pirates, Daddy.
A story about pirates, huh?
Well, let me see.
A boat!
I can see a boat!
A boat?
Did you say, "a boat"?
That isn't just any old boat out there.
No?
No?
(lN GERMAN ACCENT) No.
That is a private yacht of the notorious Baron Bomburst.
Baron Bomburst?
Baron Bomburst?
You have never heard of Baron Bomburst, ruler of Vulgaria?
The most evil man in the world!
CHlLDREN: Oh!
Yeah.
And he has sailed all the way to England because he has heard tell of a fantastic motorcar built by that brilliant inventor
Caractacus Potts.
Hooray!
Hooray!
Yes, hooray!
And he has come to steal the car and take it back to
Vulgaria with him.
CHILDREN: No!
Yeah.
MAN: (EXCLAIMS) Yes!
That car!
MAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I want it! I want it!
I want it! I want it!
But, Your Excellency. . .
Are you giving me an argument?
No, Your Excellency.
Stand by the boats!
Stand by the boats!
Man the grappling hooks.
Man the grappling hooks.
And load the cannon!
Load the cannon!
He's awful.
He's terrible.
Not only that, he isn't even nice.
But he can't steal our lovely car!
You won't let him, will you, Daddy?
Look!
They're getting closer.
We've got to get away!
Start the car.
Quickly, Daddy, before they get here.
Well, now, that's easier said than done.
But why, Daddy? Why?
Well, I'll tell you.
What none of us have noticed is while we've been sitting here, the tide has been coming in.
Now, we're completely cut off.
What are we going to do?
Do hurry, Mr. Potts!
Now don't panic.
Everyone, stay calm!
Quickly, Daddy.
Quickly. Hurry up.
Look! They are completely cut off by the tide.
They will all drown!
I haven't seen a good drowning in years!
Is there anything
I can do to help?
The throttle.
Push the throttle lever.
JEREMY: Hurry, Daddy! Hurry!
Quickly, Daddy, before they get here!
No, not that one, the other one!
It's no good.
It won't start!
We're gonna have to swim for it.
Come on, Jemima.
We must. Come on.
Come on, Jeremy.
We have to.
Come on, everybody over the side.
Quickly! (GASPS)
It's starting to change!
CARACTACUS:
Everybody, hold on!
TRULY: It's unbelievable!
Mr. Potts, it's so clever!
This is impossible!
But you built it!
It's a magic car.
You always said it was a magic car.
I did?
JEREMY: Yes. Look, it's like a boat!
I knew Chitty would save us!
Hang on, everybody!
We're off!
A floating car?
What do you think of that, Chancellor?
Yeah, Baron.
A car floating, floating on the water.
This, in my whole life long, it never could be seen, never, never.
It's uncategorical!
A fuel-burning oracle.
Phantasmagorical machine!
(SINGING) It's more than spectacular
To use the vernacular
It's wizard
It's smashing
It's keen
Oh, Chitty, you Chitty
Pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you
And, Chitty, our Chitty
Pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang loves us too
High Chitty, low Chitty, anywhere we go
On Chitty Chitty we depend
Bang Bang,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
Our fine four-fendered friend
They're firing at us!
All right.
We'll show them something.
Follow that car!
Follow that car!
My word!
I want the car!
I want that car!
I must have it!
Follow the car!
Stop that car!
After them! Faster!
I want the car!
I must have it!
Action stations, everybody.
We're going ashore!
Get out!
Where are my two spies?
Ah, there you are.
Now, then, I have a secret mission for you.
You will go ashore, and you will capture that motorcar, understand?
Good.
But if you fail,
I will cut off your heads.
Out.
I want that car!
Now, then, where are we?
I have here a map.
I know where we are, stupid!
We are in England!
And when we are in England, what do we do?
We play cricket!
We play. . .
No. We dress like Englishmen.
BOTH: A-ha!
Remarkable weather we are having for the time of year.
Do you not think so, Cuthbort?
Indubitably, Basil.
You know, Mr. Potts. . .
Caractacus.
It's a pretty silly name, isn't it?
Oh, I don't think so.
You know,
I really owe you an apology.
You're more than just a father to those two children.
Oh, yes.
Nursemaid, private tutor, chief, cook, and bottle washer.
Everything.
Except what they really need.
Well, it's been quite a day.
Yes, certainly has.
Thank you, (WHISPERING) and say goodbye to the children for me.
Yes, I will.
I hope we'll see you again.
I hope so, too. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
(SINGING) This lovely, lonely man
I've only known a day
I look at him
And cannot look away
Oh, what a love
Oh, what a lovely, lonely man
I've met so many men
So easy to forget
I thought I'd grown immune to them
And yet
He's such a love
He's such a lovely, lonely man
How did he touch my heart?
How did this feeling start?
This glow that feels so warm inside
This sudden summer storm inside
My life now has a plan
To someday make him see
That I need him as much as he needs me
Oh, what a love
Oh, what a lovely, lonely man
My life now has a plan
To someday make him see
That I need him as much as he needs me
Oh, what a love
Oh, what a lovely, lonely man
Oh, how I love this one and only man
Quickly! Quickly!
They're coming!
They're coming!
Hurry! They're coming!
Quickly! Quickly!
Come on. Hurry.
Come on! Come on!
They're coming!
Get ready.
Get ready. Fire!
Stop, stop, stop!
This way.
No! Stop! Stop, stop.
They're trying to get past, Daddy.
Fine.
Go on.
Get over, you half-wit.
It's Father. And he's in one of his tempers.
Oh, that'll be a change.
You'd better let him pass.
I can't.
There isn't room.
Get out of the way.
Move over, you idiot!
Turn off here.
What do you think you're doing?
We've got him!
Drive away from here.
Whoa!
LORD SCRUMPTIOUS:
You nincompoops!
I'll have you sent away for the rest of your natural lives.
I suppose you blue-faced baboons have some explanation for this outrage.
You stupid fool!
Why? What have I done?
What have you. . .
Ah, ah!
I have an idea.
Now, remember, we are supposed to be
English gentlemen.
So let us try and behave like
English gentlemen.
So open the door!
Caracatacacus Potts.
Inventor.
Typical English eccentric.
That must be the inventor.
Hmm.
Pardon me for protruding, but have I the pleasure of addressing Herr...
(CLEARS THROAT) Mr. Potts?
Yes, that's me.
What do you want?
You selling something?
I don't want nothing.
Excuse me.
I'm off to Africa.
Africa. (CHUCKLES)
That was a ruse to put us off the scent.
I know where he has gone.
Where? Where?
He has gone into his laboratory.
Quick! The portable wireless transmitter!

Hello!
What's your game, then?
What's going on?
Oi, I'm flying!
Look!
JEREMY: What's that?
JEMlMA: It's a big balloon.
JEREMY: It's a zeppelin.
What's that underneath?
That's. . .
That's Grandpa's hut.
But what's it doing up there?
Well, I don't know.
Help me! Caractacus, my boy.
I'm being kidnapped!
Grandpa, what do you think you're doing?
You come down here!
Caractacus! My boy, it's me, your own father!
Caractacus!
They're not getting away with that.
Grandpa!
Hold tight, back there.
Sit down, Jeremy.
Quickly, Daddy, quickly!
Hurry, Daddy.
Caractacus!
Grandpa!
CARACTACUS: Hold on, Grandpa!
We're coming!
Help!
JEMlMA: Come back, Grandpa!
Hey, Grandpa, come back.
What do you think you're doing?
I'm being abducted by foreigners! Caractacus!
Hey!
Grandpa!
Faster, Daddy, faster.
Where do they think they're going?
(GASPS) Look out!
JEMlMA: Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!
(CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG
PLAYING)
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Where do they think they're going?
(GASPS) Look out!
JEMlMA: Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!
What's happening?
Look.
Look at that.
It's fantastic.
Oh!
You're a genius.
It's nothing, really.
Look! There they are!
JEREMY: Come on, Daddy, after them.
Right, we'll catch them up.
Oh!
Oh, we've lost them.
We'll find them, all right.
But what about Grandpa?
Don't worry about Grandpa.
Grandpa can take care of himself.

This is elegance by the mile

We're still losing height?
There must be something else we can throw out.
But there's nothing else we can throw out.
There's nothing else we. . .

Start swimming!
I don't swim.
Then start drowning!

P-O-S-H, posh
Hello.
Where are we?
Somewhere over the North Sea, I think.
Don't you know where we're going?
No, I don't, but Chitty does.
I think we're in pretty good hands.
BARON: Good morning.
This is your
Captain speaking.
We hope you had a pleasant trip.
In a few moments we will be landing in Vulgaria.
Where?
Vulgaria.
Oh.
So, please, fasten your seat belts.
And no smoking.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Speed, four and a half knots, sir.
Wind, east-southeast, sir.
Brigade, attention!
Present arms!
We have a guest.
Welcome him.
Jawohl, your Excellency.
Order arms!
Ah, Professor Potts.
Please, to walk this way.
Present arms!
On behalf of
Her Majesty The Queen,
I'd like. . .
Oi! (WHISTLES)
Excuse me.
You're early!
Oh!
Down the table and in the pocket.
Cheat, cheat, cheat.
Ah, Professor Potts!
Professor?
Vulgaria welcomes the brilliant
Professor Potts, inventor extraordinaire.
Excuse me, sir.
There seems to be some sort of mistake.
What?
You are not Professor Potts, the inventor?
Well, l. . .
Executioner!
ALL: Executioner!
What would you like me to invent, sir?
I will show you. My horse!
MAN: Get the horse for his Excellency.
Giddy-up.
How proud you look on that fine horse.
The most beautiful toy you ever bought me, my darling.
But who is this?
This is Professor Potts from England.
How do you do, madam?
And I think we have a surprise for you.
Herr Professor, come on.
(BIDDING FAREWELL
IN FRENCH)
Well, what do you think, professor?
Everything you need.
And these will be your assistants.
And here, this is the Baronial car.
Can you make this car float?
Float?
Like amphibial
English moty car, float over the cresty wave of the water.
Yes, sir, but you see, it's not that easy without my laboratory.
Oh, I have already thought of that.
Here is your lavatory.
If you succeed in making the car float,
I will make you privy councilor.
But if you fail,
I will stuff your head with sauerkraut and feed you to the dogs!
Feedy dorribles, snarly (SNORTS) horribold.
You have got 24 hours!
Twenty-four hours and worky nosy grindstone.
Proper card he is.
Odd sense of humor.
Stuff me head with sauerkraut.
The Baron never makes jokes.
Look at us.
We've been here for years and years.
I came here to repair the telephone.
That was 24 years ago.
They have terrible tortures.
The thumbscrew and rack.
They stretch you and stretch you!
When I first came here,
I was a midget.
Come on.
Me? Floating car?
Well, that's impossible!
Nothing's impossible.
Now, that's what my son's always saying.
We'll help you, won't we, lads?
Nil desperandum.
We'll succeed. You'll see.
Courage, man, courage.
(SINGING) Every bursted bubble has a glory
Each abysmal failure makes a point
Every glowing path that goes astray
Shows you how to find a better way
So every time you stumble, never grumble
Next time you'll bumble even less
For up from the ashes
Up from the ashes
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Grow the roses of success
Oh, yes!
Grow the roses
Those rosy roses
From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success
Yes. I know, but he wants it to float.
It will!
For every big mistake you make
Be grateful
Hear, hear!
That mistake you'll never make again
No, sir
Every shiny dream that fades and dies
Generates the steam for two more tries
There's magic in the wake of a fiasco
Correct!
It gives you that chance to second guess
Oh, yes!
Then up from the ashes
Up from the ashes
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Grow the roses
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Those rosy roses
From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success
Disaster didn't stymie Louis Pasteur
No, sir
Edison took years to see the light
Right
Alexander Graham knew failure well
He took a lot of knocks to ring that bell
So when it gets distressing, it's a blessing
Onward and upward you must press
Yes, yes
Till up from the ashes
Up from the ashes
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Those rosy roses
From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success
Start the engine!
Success!
Batten the hatches!
Success!
Man the shrouds!
Lift the anchor!
Success!
Oh, Daddy, we'll never find him.
We must keep looking.
Look, look!
What's that down there?
CARACTACUS: A-ha!
Let's have a look.
Look!
The zeppelin.
JEREMY: We've found Grandpa!
CARACTACUS: No, not yet, we haven't.
BARON: What's that?
No, no, no.
What's happening?
MAN: Remarkable.
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency!
We're being attacked!
Attacked?
Attacked!
That was that terrible Bomburst.
It certainly was.
Where are they going?
Where did they go?
Look, it's a car!
Look, that car's flying!
Floating in the heavenly abode, four peoplebodes.
There they are!
Fire!
What's the matter with you?
Do you want to destroy my beautiful car?
They're firing at us.
Children.
There are children up there.
Children!
We'd better get away from here.
Now, hang on, everybody.
We're coming in to land.
Your Excellency, it's landing in the village.
In the village.
Call out the guards!
Everybody, charge!
And call out the child catcher.
Charge.
Charge! Charge!
Oh.
Let me in!
JEMlMA: Hooray!
We've landed! Hooray!
We've landed!
Hooray! Hooray!
Isn't Chitty wonderful?
Aren't you clever, Daddy?
Yes, he certainly is.
All right. You all stay here.
I'm going up to that castle.
We want to come, too.
We want to help you find Grandpa.
Don't you think we ought to stay together?
Maybe you're right.
All right, come along.
Come on, children.
TRULY: I wonder where we are.
CARACTACUS:
I don't know.
Come on.
Pardon me, sir.
The castle?
What's the matter with him?
Come on.
What are they staring at?
I don't know.
It seems to be the children.
What's the matter with them?
Haven't they seen children before?
Haven't you noticed?
There aren't any children.
Not one.
What's going on?
What's happening?
What's. . .
Hey, you. What's happening?
What's going on?
What is it?
Soldiers! Soldiers!
Hey, you there.
Get those children in here.
Would you mind telling me what's happening?
Quickly, before the soldiers get here.
Soldiers?
Come, Fräulein.
Quickly, quickly.
Get inside.
Just a minute.
Would somebody mind telling me what's going on?
Please don't talk.
We must get those children out of sight.
Jeremy!
If the soldiers find them, they will take them away.
But why? What for?
It's the law.
Nobody's allowed to have children in Vulgaria.
Not allowed?
What about these toys?
The Baroness, she hates children.
Who could hate children?
Quickly, down there!
Whatever you do, don't make a sound.
I want every house in this square to be searched from top to bottom!
Jawohl, Captain!
The first section, step out over there and search!
The second section, over there and search.
Quick!
Section three, over there.
Quick! Search!
Search everywhere!
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!
There are children here somewhere.
I can smell them.
A-ha!
Captain,
I think we've got them.
Lieutenant.
You two men, break down this door.
Quick! Quick!
Yes, sir!
Get this door open.
Quickly!
All right! I'm coming!
I'm coming!
Open the door!
Break the door down!
Quickly!
You have no right to come into here.
You've no right.
Search the place!
Search! Search!
A-ha!
They are here somewhere.
I can feel it in my bones.
There are children here somewhere.
Children?
In the toy shop?
Such a notion.
I mean. . .
What do you think you're you doing?
That's something special for the Baron's birthday.
Let me tell you, toymaker.
This nose of mine has never failed me, and if there are children here, my friend, you will die.
A-ha!
Quick! Open it up!
Get down there and search the cellar!
The Baroness will have your teeth for a necklace and your eyeballs for earrings.
Nobody down here, sir.
Fool! ldiot!
Out of my way!
You have to know where to look.
Like cockroaches, they get under the floors, in the cracks in the walls, in the woodwork.
I don't trust a man who makes toys in a land where children are forbidden.
Every toy I make is exclusively for his
Excellency, the Baron.
SOLDlER: Captain, Captain, the flying car!
We've captured the flying car!
CAPTAlN: Come on!
Let's go!
Uh-huh!
Take this car to the castle!
They can't take
Chitty, Daddy.
Daddy, do something.
They can't take
Chitty away.
What are you going to do?
Well, I don't know, but I'm not just gonna stand here.
Are you mad?
Are you going to take on the whole Vulgarian Army single-handed?
What kind of a country is this?
No children!
Everybody terrified out of their lives.
My friend, take some good advice.
Take your children and your good lady and get out of Vulgaria.
And leave Grandpa up in the castle?
Oh, no.
We came to get him out, that's what we're gonna do.
Just tell me how to get there.
Look, I'm only a toymaker.
And if I don't finish this in time for the Baron's birthday tomorrow,
I shall be a dead toymaker.
All right. I'll go myself.
Truly, you stay here with the children.
All right. All right.
You don't know what you're letting yourself in for, believe me.
Here's one for you, one for you.
Thank you.
Thank you, toymaker.
Keep them out of sight, please!
You be good children.
And you do what
Truly tells you.
Yes, Daddy.
We will.
TOYMAKER:
Well, are you coming?
(SOFTLY) Come.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.
There isn't a scrap of food in the place.
I'm so hungry, my tummy hurts.
Mine's making funny noises.
I simply must find something for you.
Now, if you promise me not to move from here until I come back. . .
We promise, don't we, Jemima?
Yes.
Now, you remember, you stay right here.
To get in that way, you would have to be a mouse or a magician.
We should go down now before a sentry sees us.
Come. Come.
Ah, the flying car!
At last it's mine!
Send for the inventor!
Then, fly!
Fly.
Yes, fly.
Come on, fly.
Fly, fly, fly. Oh.
I command you to fly!
Bring him over here.
Over here.
Hello.
What's this doing here?
You're the inventor.
Make this car fly.
Make it fly. Go get in.
Stand back, everyone!
We are going to fly.
Stand back.
Yoo-hoo, Bombie!
Wait for me!
No, every time I want to have a little fun, she turns up.
There you are. Get in.
My darling, we're going for a fly.
How exciting.
Fly. How thrilling.
Very well. Come on.
Hurry up.
Yes, yes,
I'm doing my best, sir.
Now just a minute.
Here's one that we haven't tried yet.
Here we go, my beloved.
Hold on!
Isn't it exciting, my dear?
Oh!
You're a genius.
My guns! Bring my guns!
Don't worry.
I'll get you down.
I've been waiting for this for 20 years.
Hold on, my love.
Are you still there, my love?
Don't move.
There she is,
Your Excellency.
Oh! Oh! My God.
My diamonds.
Are you all right, my dear?
I'm all right, my dumpling.
Good.
Never mind.
I'll get her the next time.
Here we are, children.
Come and get your lollipops.
Lollipops.
Come along, my little ones.
Lollipops.
Ice cream, chocolate, all free today.
Listen.
Come along, children.
Lollipops.
What's that?
Children, where are you?
I know you're here somewhere.
I've lots of lovely goodies for you.
Jeremy, you mustn't.
Lollipops.
And all free today.
Cherry pies. Cream puffs. lce cream. Treacle tarts.
Treacle tarts!
And ice creams.
And all free!
Come along, kiddie-winkies.
Come on!
But, Jeremy,
Truly said we mustn't. . .
We'll get Truly some as well. Come on.
Mr. Man!
Hey! Wait!
Children!
Come back here!
Wait! Wait!
Come along, my little dears, my little mice. Come to me.
What will it be? lce cream?
Yes, ice cream!
Strawberry, chocolate, vanilla?
Strawberry! Chocolate!
It's all inside.
Yes, strawberry!
Come along, my little dears.
Goodie! Come on. Yes!
Come inside.
Not a penny to pay.
Yes, come on.
Get in.
Go inside, my little dears!
No. Help, help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Children! Children!
CARACTACUS: Truly!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
What is it?
What's happened?
The children!
He took the children!
Your Excellency!
Let us out!
Let us out!
Silence!
Children,
Your Highness.
Foreign children.
Unique specimens.
You're sure they can't get out?
No, Your Highness.
Perhaps Your Highness would care to examine them.
Nasty little creatures.
Very, very treacherous.
Foreign.
Just you wait till our daddy hears about this.
He'll come and blow up the whole castle!
Take them away to the tower.
To the tower!
Nasty, horrid, mean old lady.
And very ugly.
Oh, she's going!
She's going!
Two hundred feet above us through that solid rock is the castle of
Baron Bomburst.
These are our children.
For 12 years, we have hidden them here.
Look at them.
They don't know what a tree looks like or what it is to run or to laugh in the sunshine.
Do you, eh?
Food!
Get the food here.
Come on!
There's bread for everyone.
Look at them.
Like little rats, they run up and down the sewers, stealing food from the kitchens.
. . .potatoes.
Here, catch!
Son! Son!
I'm looking for my children.
I think they're up there in the castle with their grandfather.
Have you seen anything of them?
No, sir.
A little boy and girl?
Yes.
They're locked up in the tower.
And the grandfather?
He's in the dungeon under the castle.
Sir, have you come to help us?
Are you going to take us out of here?
What's your name, son?
Peter, sir.
Well, Peter, you shouldn't be afraid, even in a terrible place like this, because there's always hope.
That's what I always tell my children when they're afraid.
(SINGING) A gentle breeze from Hushabye Mountain
Softly blows o'er Lullaby Bay
It fills the sails of boats that are waiting
Waiting to sail
So close your eyes on Hushabye Mountain
Wave goodbye to cares of the day
And watch your boat from Hushabye Mountain
Sail far away from Lullaby Bay
Is that the only advice you have to offer, my friend? Hmm?
It's a beautiful dream,
Caractacus, but I don't see how it's gonna help them.
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna get up into that castle.
It is impossible!
Well, we'll see.
Now, everybody listen to me.
You want to get out of here, don't you?
ALL: Yes! Yes!
Tomorrow is
Baron Bomburst's birthday, yes?
Well, we're gonna give him a birthday party he'll never forget.
I want everybody to gather around here.
I have an idea.
Yes, come in closer.
All right, quiet!
(SINGING) Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday, dear Bombie...
Don't move. What a picture!
Such memories it brings back.
My little dumpling!
(SINGING) You're my little chu-chi face
My coot-chi, coot-chi woot-chi little chu-chi face
Every time I look at you
I sigh
And you're my little teddy bear
My lovey lovey dovey little teddy bear
Yoo-hoo!
You're the Apfelstrudel of mein eye
Your chu-chi woot-chi nose
Your chu-chi woot-chi eyes
They set my heart aflutter
Your oot-chi, coot-chi ways
Your oot-chi, coot-chi gaze
Wilts me down like melting butter
You're my little chu-chi face
And you're my teddy bear
Together we're a chu-chi, woot-chi, oot-chi, coot-chi pair
Whatever you may ask becomes my happy task
I only live to serve you
I never will divine what magic made you mine
I only know
I don't deserve you
You're my little chu-chi face
And you're my teddy bear
Together we're a chu-chi, woot-chi, oot-chi, coot-chi
Chu-chi
Woot-chi
Oot-chi
Coot-chi
Chu-chi, woot-chi, oot-chi, coot-chi pair
Oh, what a rotten birthday party.
Never mind, my little Bombie.
I have a surprise for you.
Surprises?
Oh, I love surprises!
Sit down quickly.
Summon the toymaker!
Come on! Come on! Hurry up!
Don't waste time!
Your Excellency, may I be permitted to wish you all you wish yourself on this happy occasion.
Never mind all that.
What have you made me for my birthday?
What have I made you?
Such a toy!
Such a work of mechanical perfection.
Well, well, well, where is it?
Bring it in!
Right away.
I'll just get it for you.
Bring in the Baron's birthday present!
TOYMAKER: Here, here, here.
This year, Your Excellency,
I have surpassed even myself.
Put it down there.
Careful! Careful with it!
For months,
I have been working night und day perfecting every little detail to bring you this!
Dolls? Dolls?
I have hundreds of dolls!
(CRYING) No dolls.
But this is not just an ordinary doll,
Your Excellency.
You see?
(SINGING) What do you see?
You people gazing at me
You see a doll on a music box
That's wound by a key
How can you tell
I'm under a spell?
I'm waiting for love's first kiss
You cannot see
How much I long to be free
Turning around on this music box
That's wound by a key
Yearning
While
I'm
Turning around and around
(SINGING) What do you see?
Truly Scrumptious
You people gazing at me
You're truly, truly scrumptious
You see a doll on a music box
Scrumptious...
That's wound by a key
How can you tell
I'm under a spell?
I'm waiting for love's first kiss
Honest, Truly
You're the answer to my wishes
You cannot see
Truly Scrumptious
How much
I long to be free
Though I may seem presumptuous
Turning around on this music box
That's wound by a key
Yearning
My heart beats so unruly
Yearning
Because I love you truly
While I'm
Honest, Truly
I do
Turning around and around
Just a minute!
Oh, I'm so happy,
I could jump for joy!
Come on!
Follow me.
Children! No! No!
BARON: No! No!
No!
Let me down!
Call out the cavalry!
Let me down!
TRULY: Jeremy!
CARACTACUS: Jemima!
TRULY: Jeremy!
They could be anywhere.
You look down that way.
I'll go this way.
Jeremy! Jemima!
Jeremy and Jemima!
Jeremy! Jemima!
It's Truly!
Truly! We're in here!
Don't worry.
We'll get you out of here in a minute.
Here! Here, quick.
Quick, they're in there.
Children, are you all right?
CHlLDREN: Get us out of here!
We found them.
They're in there. Come on.
Help me break the door down.
Children, get away from the door.
Children!
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Let me down!
Ow!
My Liebchen, are you hurt?
My back is broken.
We must escape through the cellars.
Very well. Come on.
Come on!
Daddy, look at the children.
You stay here.
JEMIMA: Daddy!
What are you doing?
Where are all these children coming from?
I thought we had passed a law against children.
Quick. This way.
Where are we going?
Quickly. We'll go down here.
(GASPS) No, no.
I'll get my clothes dirty.
Don't argue.
Oh, my crown.
I lost my crown.
Oh, never mind, my little pumpkin.
Here.
Attack!
No! Daddy!
Look! There's Chitty!
Chitty's come to save us!
Hooray!
Hello, a motorcar.
What's that doing here?
There's Grandpa.
Grandpa!
Caractacus! My boy!
Are you all right?
Oh!
Stand back from the propellers.
Keep clear.
Bye!
Bye! Bye!
Bye! Bye!
CARACTACUS: And so, after that, Vulgaria became a free country, and all the children laughed and played in the sunshine, and they were very, very happy.
And Chitty flew high over the mountains back to England, everybody safe and sound.
And Daddy and Truly were married.
And lived happily ever after.
Yes.
Is that how the story ends?
It's getting late.
We better get back.
Well. . .
Goodbye, Jeremy.
Goodbye, Jemima.
Goodbye, Truly.
Will we see you again?
Oh, I expect so.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Truly.
I'm sorry about the children.
I hope they didn't embarrass you.
In what way?
Why, that silly joke about us getting married.
Well, you know what kids are like.
Yes, I understand.
I mean, I don't think they realize how ridiculous that would be.
Ridiculous?
Well, yes.
You live in that big house, your father, the factory and all.
It's a different world, Truly.
You know, if I said something like that, you'd call me a snob.
I didn't mean. . .
Goodbye.
Well, don't you want to ride up front?
Well, that was a fine picnic, wasn't it?
Shall we have another one tomorrow?
With Truly?
Yes.
Well, Miss Scrumptious has a lot of social engagements, you know.
Are we ever going to see Truly again, Daddy?
Well, we'll see.
JEREMY: Look, that's Lord Scrumptious' car.
CARACTACUS:
Why, I believe it is.
JEMIMA: I wonder what it's doing here.
CARACTACUS:
Well, I don't know.
Come on.
Excuse me.
Good afternoon.
Are you. . .
Boom! Boom! Boom!
That's wiped out your dashed cavalry.
Yes, sir.
But I have my 2nd
Infantry battalion attacking here from the rear.
Attacking from the rear?
That's dashed unethical.
Artillery, prepare to open fire.
Fire!
GRANDPA: Number one battalion, prepare to advance!
What's going on here?
There you are, young Potts.
Been waiting for you.
And that wiped out your artillery!
You're a cad, Potts.
Would someone mind telling me what's going on?
Fancy you being old Bungie's son.
Bungie?
Bungie Potts, best batman I ever had.
Weren't you, Potts?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
You mean that you were. . .
My boy.
Allow me to introduce to you my Brigadier.
Your Brigadier?
Potts. . .
How about some more tea?
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
As for you, young man, there's a very good chance you may be very rich.
CARACTACUS: Very rich?
What do you mean?
Those confounded sweets of yours.
Useless for humans, wonderful for dogs.
Woof Sweets, that's what we'll call them.
Woof Sweets?
Canine candies.
Dogs love them.
Make a fortune.
Daddy, Daddy!
You've done it, Daddy.
You've done it!
Have l?
It's the posh life for us all now, my boy.
We're all going to be rich!
Hooray!
Do you mean to tell me
I invented something that actually works?
Of course they do.
Wouldn't be offering you a contract unless they did.
Sign here, please.
Wait. Don't go away.
I'll be right back.
LORD SCRUMPTlOUS:
What about the contract?
But, Daddy, where are you going?
Daddy!
What's the matter with the fellow?
Well, he's a bit of an eccentric, sir, a genius, of course, but definitely an eccentric.
Can't imagine where he gets it from.
Truly, you'll never believe it.
I just got home. . .
This is beginning to be. . .
. . .and your father was at my house.
. . .a hazard.
I know! I know!
They told me at the house.
We're rich.
You know, more than that,
I have succeeded.
I always knew you would.
You know something else?
The kids were right.
There's nothing so ridiculous about the idea of getting married.
Well, whoever said there was?
Well, Mr. Potts.
What's the matter?
Now you'll have to marry me.
So dreams can come true.
Yes, they can.
Yes, they can, but you have to be practical, too.
You have to face the facts.
Man has to see things as they really are.
After all, a man with responsibilities can't walk around with his head in the clouds all the time.
A man should keep his feet solidly on the ground.
Oh, a man should have his dreams but a man has to learn to put those dreams to some practical use, not just sit around and think about them all the time.
BOTH: (SINGING) Oh, you, pretty Chitty Bang Bang

A fuel-burning oracle
A phantasmagorical machine

To use the vernacular
It's wizard
It's smashing
BOTH: It's keen
Oh, Chitty, you Chitty

When Columbus discovered America, a series of mysteries arose to confound the scholars of Europe.
Here, are two continents, completely isolated from each other.
Yet they simultaneously developed similar cultures.
For example;
The Mayans measured time, on the same principle as the Gregorian calendar of Europe.
They used the same signs of the zodiac.
The same decimal, and mathematical system.
They valued silver and gold.
Using both for jewelry and barter.
Another mystery was the banana plant.
A native of Asia, that cannot be grown from seed.
Yet, Columbus found it thriving, in the New World.
Elephants at that time, did not exist in the Americas.
Yet there likenesses were cleaved on the walls of prehistoric caves in Peru.
The pyramids in Mexico, and in Egypt, were built on identical architectural principles...
Then there was a striking resemblance of a witch of Spain...
...and the witch depicted in the New World.
But the most significant of all...
Mayan, and Aztec legends, shared with Greek, and Hebrew and Assyrian literature...
... an account of a terrible deluge.
A deluge, many believe, had destroyed the link.
The mother empire...
...that had spread her civilization, to both sides of the Atlantic.
The Greek scholar Plato, recorded this theory first, over two thousand years ago.
There was once, another continent.
I have a bite.
Look father, there.
Damn.
What?
Come back.
Demitrius, come back.
It's a trickery of sirens.
Be careful, don't touch her.
By the trident of Neptune.
A mermaid.
The flask.
Who are you?
Who can she be?
She's not one of our people.
I don't know, but no fisherman of our village, ever came home with the catch like this?
Father.
Where is this miserable hovel, and why do I wear the garb of slaves?
You are in Greece, this is our home.
The robe is mine.
You dressed me?
Someone had to.
Where are my robes?
This cloth offends my skin. they were wet, I hung them to dry.
Our fare is simple, come.
Break bread with us, and tell us your story.
Your food tempts me not.
As you wish, my little mermaid.
I am not your little mermaid!
I'm a Princess.
Princess?
Princess Antillia, the daughter of King Kronos.
And where, is this kingdom of yours, Princess?
In the great sea, beyond the Pillars of Hercules.
Pillars of Hercules!
There is nothing beyond.
The world ends there.
You doubt my word, fisherman?
Have you ever been, beyond them?
Had we, we wouldn't be here.
Do not touch me!
You smell of fish.
We should...
We are fishermen.
Now listen.
And listen well, Princess.
In our land, we have no Kings...
No Kings daughters, no slaves.
We are all free men.
Treating one another, as we would be treated ourselves.
My son and I, rescued you from the sea.
Deliver you to safety.
Our humble best you shared.
Yet we receive insults in return.
If our home is a hovel, our weave to coarse,
Our food tempts you not Royal Princess, bestow the honor of your presents on someone else.
You may help me now.
You may help yourself.
Come, Demetrius.
There are fish to be caught.
Good evening, Petros.
You're right, Antília?
Of course, why?
Your face, so pale you look sick.
Where is Demetrius?
Spreading the nets to dry.
I will help him.
She is sick.
Demetrius...
Now neither you nor I, have anything to hide.
Will you hand me my robe, or shall I come aboard as I am.
Why, you...
Beyond the sunset, is Atlantis my home.
A land of wonders beyond compare.
Take me to it, Demetrius.
My father will shower you with riches.
Antillia, all the riches I desire,
I already possess.
All save one.
The one you will never possess, fisherman.
Antillia.
Antillia!
Stand back!
- Sit down!
- Oh!
You must be mad.
There a law against stealing a boat.
I'm going home, and no law will hinder me.
Many men have tried.
Many good seamen have sailed into the sunset.
But none has ever returned, Antillia.
Not one!
- Are you afraid?
- Yes!
And rightly so, endless terrors, lurk beyond the great Pillars.
I would rather chance it and die, than live in your village another day.
Ah, forget this foolishness.
I will not let you go.
Very well, take me back.
There are other men, braver ones, who would beg for the privilege of doing my bidding.
Put me ashore, and watch me choose my traveling companion.
Listen, Antillia.
I will take you, but only on my terms.
Before the space of one moon,
I do not sight your land...
We will return to my land.
But wait that's not all.
And when we return...
You will become my beautiful wife, forever more.
As you say, Demetrius.
Antillia!
I can no longer tell east from west, north from south.
We must shore the sail and wait awhile.
No need for that.
This will guide us.
It points always to the north.
My father would call it sorcery.
It's not sorcery it's, science.
Demetrius.
It's time we ate.
No food.
Just some wine.
'Twas only a fish.
Let me fill it.
Shh!
These are cursed waters, we're turning back.
A dolphin moans, and my
Captain regrets his bargain.
It's not the bargain, it's not the dolphins, it's everything.
The fog, the silence when the wind goes.
It's voice, when it returns, whispering to me...
Turn about.
Turn about, or you'll never moor you're lonely ship.
Listen to my lips, Demetrius.
They too whispers.
But not of doom.
Tonight will bring the full moon, and there's still nothing ahead but sea.
I shall hold you to your promise?
I will keep it.
We turn back then?
Not yet.
Our bargain is for one moon...
...no more, no less.
Demetrius.
Yes?
Is the edge of the world at the Pillars of Hercules?
No.
And have you found unknown terrors, lurking behind every wave?
Well...
Well?
Well, I did see King Neptune.
But you did not truly see him.
Perhaps not.
Have I then earned your trust?
Forever.
Then believe me now, my love.
Before the full moon dies, you shall gaze upon Atlantis. I promise.
No, Demetrius.
We're not in danger.
We rejoice, Princess.
Our Gods are kind.
They bring you safely home.
With his help, Sonoy.
A guard, take him aboard.
- The name is Demetrius?
- It is.
- Fisherman?
- I can handle the net.
Could it be then, that you were born under the sign of Pisces?
- Sign?
- When were you born?
What stars control your destiny?
The stars are but for guiding seamen across the seas.
A man who speaks with a voice of a true seaman.
My name is Zaren.
This is Sonoy, who reads the stars.
With a ship like this, I would be the greatest fisherman in Greece.
You have no ships that sail under the sea?
Ah, Princess...
Your in time.
We're about to surface.
Why isn't my father here, to meet to me?
Didn't you send word to him?
The moment we discovered you.
But he is not well...
...he's waiting for you at the palace.
- Pull him off!
- Into the dungeon!
What is this?
Let go of me!
Let me go!
Let go!
Father.
Father?
- Oh.
- Antillia.
My child.
They told me you were ill.
Ill, I have been my dear with grief and worry.
Even though the stars foretold, you're safe return.
Did the star also foretell, that a stranger would return with me?
A stranger you say?
Yes father.
A wonderful stranger.
To whom will you give my hand in marriage.
But, but I had hoped that, you and Zaren...
I have never loved Zaren,
I never will.
But wait child.
We're forgetting the law.
For me, you will change it.
Don't worry my dear, It may take a little time.
Until then, it is best you not see each other.
But now...
Now I have a thousand questions.
Thank you.
Thank you for saving my life.
Your face...
I've not seen it before.
I'm Demetrius, the fisherman.
I'm Xandros, the sailor.
Xandros.
- From my homeland?
- Yes.
And the others?
All these strange men.
Where are they from?
From land I never knew existed.
Mostly seamen like you and I, blown off course, ship wrecked, washed a shore.
We sought sanctuary...
...but found instead, whips, and chains.
How long ago?
A lifetime of suffering ago.
One loses count, of time here.
I will not be here long enough to lose count.
Those were my very words, when I was first brought here.
To your feet!
There's work to be done.
Come...
Come.
Once they were men, young and strong like you.
But how could it be?
They are monsters.
How it is done, I do not know.
But in this fowl land, there are cruelties beyond belief.
Time and again, some of us are taken away without warning.
Where?
The house of fear.
Never seen again they are the beasts of burden.
Show him what to do!
Learn well and learn soon!
Or you'll feel the bite of this!
What is that?
The crystals born in the crater, capture the energy of the sun.
The little ones, are used for heat, and light.
The big one, could destroy the world.
- Fill it, I said!
- No, no, no, no, no...
One moment, your Highness.
Clear these slaves out of the way.
Into the ditch, all of you.
Get back, move along.
Forgive this your Highness, they'll have the filth, cleared from your path in a moment.
A gift, for the Princess.
You insolent slave!
Release that chain!
Your trusted Zaren, has lied to us.
He put the man who saved my life in chains.
I want him punished.
But was I, who gave the order to enslave the Greek.
You.
His Majesty, had no alternative.
By what right do you speak for your King.
What does he mean?
The law.
The law compels us to enslave foreigners.
And you my Princess, raised in the shadow of the throne, must certainly respect the law.
But what of my promises?
And what of your word, do they no longer mean anything?
But he is a foreigner, and all foreigners are dangerous.
Indeed Princess, I've consulted the stars, they do not favor him.
- You see my dear.
- In fact the Greek should have been put to death.
Yet I spared him.
Surely this is in no way to show gratitude, to the man who not only saved my life...
...but risked his very own.
Princess, you are unduly alarmed...
... He can always gain his freedom, through the ordeal of fire and water.
He wouldn't survive, you know it.
Father, please.
You enslaved him.
Free him now!
You have changed.
When I left, you were strong.
You were a King!
It's you, who have changed.
I wish I could help my child, I...
The law must be obeyed!
How dare you presume to speak for your King!
One would think you wear his crown!
In deed you do.
Oh, Azor!
Tears are of little use, Centurion.
What has Zaren, done to my father.
And what have I done to Demetrius.
I know, little one.
Come with me, your prayers are wasted here.
These Gods are false, with hearts of stone.
Azor...
Such talk is heresy.
It is the truth.
Come.
Up their my child, there dwells the one true God, who created all living things.
The true God is the moon?
No Antillia.
His hand, fashioned the moon...
And sent it spinning, through the galaxy’s of stars.
That same hand, molded the earth, with its high mountains, and deep seas.
He gave life to you, and to me.
Pray to him, Antillia.
He will listen to your prayers.
- The earth moved again last night.
- And gave us more work to do.
Remove his chains, he will come with me.
Wait here.
My orders are not to let him out of my sight.
Only nobles, may pass through these doors.
Well this Greek, is no noble.
Neither is he an Atlantean.
The Gods do not recognize the presence of barbarians, and he is one, is he not?
- Yes, but I...
- Do you argue with your Gods?
No, holy one.
Wait.
Wait, Demetrius.
Why?
You must listen to me.
I listened once, and awoke in chains.
Isn't that enough?
It wasn't my doing.
Zaren, told me you chose to return to Greece, and I believed him.
Till I saw you yesterday.
Then set me free, now.
I can't.
Why not?
Your father is the King, who will shower me with riches, remember?
He is not the same King I left here...
Zaren, has become the power in Atlantis.
Then ask Zaren.
He would have you killed, if he knew I loved you.
Subtitle created by,
Dandysubs and cryinoutloud.
Love...
You lured me to this miserable country, by lies and trickery.
You accepted my bargain, then made me believe you loved me, to keep from turning back.
And all the time, knowing I would soon be enslaved...
... is this love, Princess?
I thought my father was above the law.
You lie.
You do not think beyond your own selfish desires.
At first, true.
But when you took me in your arms...
...my heart was yours.
Your heart, comes dear Princess.
It is not worth the price I paid.
Give it to Zaren. Give him your love, and buy back my freedom.
Even your words, smell like fish.
Stay, Demetrius!
I prefer the company slaves.
Drink.
Drink.
Now, you will close your eyes.
When you are commanded to open them again, you will be a bull.
Every day, and every way, you will become more and more, like one.
Strong, strong, strong.
Take him away.
Now bring me the Greek.
And what shall you be?
Part mule, with long ridiculous ears?
Here?
Or a...
...a buffalo, with great horns.
Here, here?
But you, unlike the others...
...will be able to remember who you are.
Perhaps this would be appropriate.
Think how it would amuse the Princess, to see you as you really are.
A filthy pig.
Yes.
I have orders my Lord, Zaren.
He allows the Greek, a chance to gain his freedom.
Why do they always, take my best specimens, away from me.
But he must face the ordeal, of fire and water.
Alright.
Take him.
I will enjoy, seeing you slowly roasted alive.
What troubles you, Azor?
The doves, look at them.
In the past, they always circle the coliseum, and then return to their cages.
Now the whole flock is winging out toward the open sea.
Father it's Demetrius, you must stop this.
I will, my dear.
But Your Majesty, you can't disappoint your faithful subjects.
Of course.
I must not.
There's nothing we can do.
By his Majesty the King...
Demetrius, is a slave no more.
Here, in the middle of our vast ocean...
...is Atlantis, our mighty empire.
But no ocean is vast enough to contain our might, our power, our ambitions.
In the past, this one great crystal was enough to supply energy for all our needs.
But we cannot live in the past.
If we are to survive, we must live in the future.
And as a monument to the future, I have cause...
...to be readied another, a greater crystal in the belly of the crater.
A weapon so powerful, that with it, Governors of Atlantis, we can become, masters of the world.
You speak of wicked things, Zaren.
Do not listen to these words of war.
It's the destiny of Atlantis, to rule the world.
Do not the Gods themselves call us, the race of masters?
And isn't it also written, conquer or be conquered?
Conquered by whom?
I shall answer you.
One country alone, may not be an enemy worth fearing.
But united with other countries, could present...
...a strength that would endanger our very existence.
No!
Atlantis, can not take that chance.
We must attack them one by one.
Our only assurance of survival, is to attack and attack soon.
No. No. No.
Let Azor, be heard.
You have arms, that can repel any invasion.
Any imaginary invasion you can conceive.
More important, we have erred, in deliberately isolating Atlantis, from the rest of the world.
We should have shared, our advancements with all mankind.
The mankind you speak of, is good for one thing.
Slavery.
A country that depends upon slavery for its existence... must perish.
Your Majesty.
Noble Governors of Atlantis.
Long before he came, it was written in the stars...
...that a Greek fishermen would reach our shores.
That prophecy has been fulfilled.
It was also written, that with his arrival, the downfall of Atlantis would commence.
The fact, that a barbarian, was able to survive the ordeal of fire and water...
...is a warning nobleman, that we will be conquered by barbarians.
Unless we conquer first.
I call for war.
We of the mountains, say war.
And for the sea.
War for the rivers.
And for science.
And the animals.
War.
War.
You, priest?
Let it be war.
Empty?
Just as all the others.
The bees have deserted us.
Strange.
Each morning of my life,
I have awakened to the singing birds.
Now only silence, greets the day.
Perhaps it is instinct, call it what you will.
But they sense something, something evil.
A strange breeze now rises, with every outgoing tide...
Blowing dead leaves, out toward the open sea.
The humblest insects, seem to know it carries them...
...not to destruction... but to survival.
Even the seeds, forsake their mother soil.
All nature senses, that the end is near.
Man alone, turns deaf ears to natures warnings.
The Princess would speak to you, Demetrius.
I have no wish to speak to her.
It is best that you do.
I'm here to repay the debt I owe you.
Tonight at moon rise, the fishing fleet sets sail from the north harbor.
Be there.
One ship bears the Kings crest.
The captain will be waiting for you.
He will take you aboard, and set you ashore, at the Pillars of Hercules.
You must find your own way from their.
Antillia.
If you suspect treachery, set your mind at rest.
The words I spoke when last we met...
...they were words of anger.
Forgive me.
Thank you, Antillia.
You owe thanks to no one.
Your farewells, were said quickly.
She loves you.
I wish it were true.
I'm leaving.
Antillia, told me so in trust.
Do you want me to stay?
To remain in Atlantis, is to die.
None will be spared.
And doomsday is not far off.
But no one can foretell the future, not even a holy man.
I was not always a priest my son.
In the days when Atlantis, was a just, and noble land, I was well versed in sciences.
But I hid my eyes, when she began to use her great knowledge for evil.
And fashioned Gods, after her own scientific achievements.
For this, we will die.
The true God, will destroy Atlantis.
But why do you stay, Azor?
Because, guilt rests heavy on my heart.
We created wonders for the good of mankind.
Then turned them into monsters.
The crystals capture the rays of the sun, the base stores the energy.
They seem identical yet, vary greatly in function.
Now, this is a model, of the original invention.
It's purpose...
Provides warmth, and light, comfort.
Feel it.
Now see what they have done with it.
That urn...
Zaren, now builds one that has a thousand times more power.
Within a moon, it will be ready, and with it, he will subjugate the world.
Why are you telling me this?
You can warn the world, your own people, when you reach home.
But what defense, have we?
None.
And if I stay...
What can I do, to halt Zaren's, plan.
Nothing now, but tomorrow may bring a chance.
I can not wait til tomorrow, my ship leaves tonight.
Demetrius...
Dawn this seamen's garb, it will make your boarding easier.
Farewell, Azor.
God, shield you my son.
All my calculations, add up to the same conclusion.
On the next full moon, you must depart for conquest.
It'll give me little time, to finish the crystal.
It is the only date, the stars favor.
It'll be ready.
One man, Demetrius, wishes to see you my Lord.
 Let him enter.
You need my help.
Why would I need the help of a slave?
Forgive my stumbling tongue, a free man.
I'm also a fisherman, who knows the waters, and lands you do not know.
I can lead your ship safely, through the
Pillars of Hercules, into the hidden sea.
I can add color, to the darkness of your chart.
Why this change of heart?
Other slaves would rather face death, than give us guidance.
I have tasted luxury, and groomed an appetite for it.
Your friends in the dungeon, will call you a traitor.
Let them.
I can find comfort in, silver, and beaten gold.
Well?
Are we to bargain with the slaves?
He will bring us disaster.
You must excuse, our impetuous astrologer.
A bargain it is.
Proceed, Demetrius.
Let me see you change, the face of the world.
What do you think, map maker?
Well my Lord is aware, that none of our ships has ever returned, from the hidden sea.
They must have perished in the, treacherous reefs, or in the shifting currents, of the Pillars of Hercules.
We therefore possess virtually, no knowledge, only speculation.
The chance, favors this, being a trustworthy guide.
I'll wager, not one detail is correct.
We'll soon see.
Guard.
You, traitorous dog!
You traitor!
Remove him.
You stinking, filthy, traitor!
You filthy traitor! You swine!
You stinking traitor!
I'll take my pay now.
Of course, Demetrius.
This is only a sample, of my generosity,
I may have need of your services again.
I would never trust this Greek.
He lies with every breath
Dwell with your stars, Sonoy, and let matters of importance, rest in my hands.
I Trust men, who put wealth, above honor.
Another warning.
I measure the lava, every day.
It rises steadily.
A sea of boiling devastation, below Atlantis.
Straining at the throat of this sleeping volcano.
Waiting for the beginning of the end.
When is the end, Azor?
Soon after the next full moon.
Soon after Zaren, and his warriors, have set sail to, conquer the world.
But if Zaren, is delayed, this conquest can never take place.
My Lord Zaren, waits impatiently.
You should have been here before this.
Look.
Another delay.
There's little time left, and the slaves, grow lazier by the hour.
They can't help me.
You must help me.
What can you do?
Nothing.
But you, a man of wisdom, must surely know a way.
There is a limit to mans endurance.
These men have reached that limit.
They must rest!
Our Priest, has a splendid remedy.
Indeed.
I have an even better one.
Captain!
A score of them, to the gallows.
That will cure, the others.
The gallows, is not the answer, Zaren.
Listen to a man, that was once a slave.
What is your remedy?
Put me in charge here.
Then, what would you do?
Put up a camp near by, the dungeon is far away.
The slaves weary, before they begin their daily tasks.
Remove their chains, discard the whip, give them decent food.
Ridiculous, why should I grant such insane demands?
You have no choice.
Very well.
Of course, my services are not without a fee.
You have sampled my generosity.
You can rely upon it again.
But if you fail...
I will succeed.
I'm awake, Xandros.
The others are waiting.
They believe as I, that Demetrius, did not betray his friends.
We're all eager to help you with your plan.
I've been thinking.
Wishing I could do something to help you.
There's nothing you can do.
Nothing anyone can do.
It slowly eats its way, through the will, of the mind...
Till I'm no longer human.
In the end, I must be locked up, with the others.
Come, we must be on our way.
I want to help you, while I still can.
Remove the wedge.
Hurry, hurry!
- Set the bit deeper.
- Hurry, hurry!
- Volcano will wake!
- Hurry, hurry!
- Destroy the crystal.
- Hurry, hurry!
- Before the full moon.
- Hurry, hurry!
- Before Zaren, sees us.
- Hurry, hurry!
- Come up lava.
- Soon, soon!
- Crystal be damned.
- Damn, damn.
- Zaren, shall not conquer.
- No, no!.
Hurry, hurry!
Hurry, hurry, hurry...
I want to be your wife, Demetrius.
I love you.
Take me away.
I can't.
Your boat waits in the secret cove.
Let's leave Atlantis, and never return.
I have wronged you Demetrius, I know.
No that's not it Antillia, believe me.
What is it then?
I can't tell you.
Not yet.
Very well, leave me behind if you will.
But you must leave Atlantis, at once.
As soon as you finish your task,
Zaren, will kill you.
That's a chance I must take.
Please Princess, leave now, the sun will soon rise and he needs rest.
Trust me Antillia.
- Volcano will leak.
- Covering more, covering more.
- Come up lava.
- Covering more, covering more.
- Our days are numbered.
- Hurry more, hurry more.
- Destroy the crystal.
- Hurry more, hurry more.
- Before the full Moon.
- Hurry more, hurry...
- Come up lava.
- Now, now.
- Crystal be damned.
- Shh!
There, there!
No, this way.
Quick, cover the entrance!
They mustn't find the shaft.
There they are!
Go get them!
We'll, kill every last one of them!
- There!
- Don't let them get away.
Where is the Greek?
He can not be far.
Find him!
Free yourselves!
The end has come.
To the harbor!
Board the ships!
Insolent gravel!
Dare them, enter my palace.
Follow me!
No. No. No.
Antillia!
Antillia!
Antillia!
Antillia!
The water's rising, we are trapped!
No escape there, the harbor is sealed, it's flooded with the lava!
Here, this way!
Damn you.
Atlantis is gone.
But free men, wiser men...
...carried the culture, from the mother empire...
...to the four corners, of the earth.

The legend of Jack the Giant Killer was born more than a thousand years ago in Cornwall, England near Land's End.
There was a time when the kingdom of Cornwall lived in fear and trembling of the black prince
Pendragon, master of all witches, giants, and hobgoblins who ravaged the land.
But at long last, Herla the wizard drove Pendragon and all his witches from the kingdom and exiled them beyond the reaches of the known world.
Here, on a misty isle uncharted and unknown
Pendragon schemed and waited for the day when he would return to power in Cornwall.
Then, after many years, the day came.
It was a day of great rejoicing in Cornwall and kings and princes bearing gifts came to celebrate a special occasion.
Know then, Princess
Elaine that as you are by the grace of God the only child of our noble king therefore I now place upon your head this ancient coronet of the house of Cornwall.
May you wear it in honor as befits our future queen.
Rise, Elaine.
Trumpeters, proclaim the festivities.
Let the bells ring.
Health and happiness to the princess Elaine.
May she live to be a hundred years.
For the great Elaine's birthday.
Come on, move aside.
For your country.
As the people of Cornwall celebrated, Pendragon arrived.
Make way.
And now the presentation of gifts.
His Highness Vallons, Duke of Normandy.
His Excellency, the prince of Tarquin Isle Elidorus.
It is exquisite, King Meliodas.
Elidorus?
Know you this prince, Chancellor?
Never have I heard the name yet there's something faintly familiar if I can but recall.
Your most gracious majesty King Mark.
I apologize for the lateness of my arrival.
Prince Elidorus?
I cannot seem to remember.
When was it that we met?
We never have, Your Majesty.
Yet you honor my daughter's birthday?
I have always admired the crown of Cornwall.
Therefore I took the liberty of bringing
Her Royal Highness a small, but unique gift.
If you please, Garna.
Certainly, master.
Thank you, Prince.
May I see what's inside?
- Allow me, Princess.
A music box.
He walks.
Why, he could almost be alive.
A nation merchant of whom I acquired him spoke of a curious talent.
Look, Father, what an unusual gift.
I believe he wishes this dance.
Certainly, my cavalier.
Oh, you were wonderful.
What an enchanting gift, Prince Elidorus.
Enter.
More gifts.
Bring them over here.
Put them on the table.
Careful, now.
You were lovely today, Princess.
Your father was proud of you.
I think my father is slightly prejudiced.
It was nice to be remembered by so many people.
One day, it'll be a crown you'll be wearing, the queen of a mighty kingdom.
My father still has many good years ahead of him.
I don't like to think about that day.
Of course not.
When you're young, it's only today that counts.
Into bed with you.
Good night, Princess.
Sleep well, Lady Constance.
A pity to shatter your innocent dreams, Princess Elaine, but the throne of Cornwall is to be mine and only you can give it to me.
Garna, quickly.
Cormoran will meet you at the place appointed.
Be assured, Master, all will be as you wish.
No, no!
No!
- Princess.
It's the princess.
Something's happened to the princess.
Guards, guards.
The princess.
No!
No!
My daughter.
Elaine.
Elaine!
Make room.
Break it down.
Elaine, Elaine!
Elaine!
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.
A giant is running off with the princess.
Alarm, sound the alarm.
Guards, guards, stop him.
Stop him, men!
Lower the gates!
Drop the portcullis.
Get him.
Repair the bridge, men.
Axes and poles.
Guards, lend a hand.
We can't let him out of our sight.
It's been years since giants were banished.
Why would they return now?
Why?
Come on, Jonathan, Tom.
It's a beautiful day.
Whoa, oh.
OK, Tom, come on, back.
Back, back.
Oh.
Come on, Tom.
Come on, oh.
What's the matter with you two this morning?
We have to get that feed to town whether you like it or not.
Now come on, no more nonsense, back.
What's going on around here?
Well done, Cormoran.
Leaving so soon, Princess?
Why, your voyage has just begun.
No, no, no.
Let me go, please, help.
Who's to hear you, Princess?
- Please.
- Now quiet.
Please let me go.
The master has planned a nice long voyage for you...
- Please.
- In honor of your birthday.
Don't.
Cormoran!
Look out!
Cormoran!
Cormoran!
Cormoran!
Cormoran!
Cormoran!
Cormoran!
Cormoran, after them!
Head them off.
Bring them back.
Quick, the loft.
Look out, run!
Are you all right?
You've done it.
You killed him.
It was nothing.
I kill a giant every morning before breakfast.
Starts my day right.
I think you'd better put this on.
You, farmer.
Have you seen the princess?
Your Majesty.
Kneel, girl, it's the king.
The princess, Your Majesty?
Elaine.
Young man be good enough to come down from there with my daughter.
Oh, I'm sorry, Princess.
I didn't know.
Well, young man?
We mustn't keep the king waiting.
- Elaine.
- Father.
The Lord has been merciful.
Oh, father, this is the young man who so bravely rescued me from the giant.
- Rise, my boy.
- Jack, Jack.
Oh, Jack.
You're safe.
When I saw that horrible monster...
Mother, this is the king.
Your Majesty.
Rise, madame.
Forgive me, I was so thankful to see my son alive.
I'm so thankful to see my daughter alive.
Oh, poor child, I have some hot porridge on the fire.
She'll need warmth and rest before she returns to the castle.
You've done a most remarkable deed, young man.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I'm proud to serve the king as my father did.
Your father served the crown?
Yes, in the royal archers.
He fell at the Battle of Land's End.
A noble battle then, a noble battle now.
Your father would have been proud of you this day.
Come, let's have a look at your giant.
Hideous creature.
The boat.
The strange boat that was taking the princess away.
Hurry, Your Majesty.
But it was...
There it is the small black craft.
And there was a strange, dwarf-like man, Your Majesty.
- The servant, Garna.
- You know him, Sire?
I know him and his master.
Master.
Master.
Master Pendragon.
What happened?
Calamity, O Prince.
Most fateful disaster.
The princess where is she?
Cormoran is dead, slain by a young farmer.
By now the princess is back in her father's castle.
Impossible, you're lying.
I tell the truth, Master.
I swear it.
He took her from me at the boat and then killed the giant.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Blundering fool.
A fury take you to your torment all of you.
I scheme a thousand nights put the princess in your very hands.
And you, imbecile, idiot allow a mere farmer, a mortal, to defy me.
We have failed, Master.
We have failed.
But only for a moment.
I shall have the princess, and the farmer shall die.
By all the powers of darkness, he shall die.
For returning to us the princess alive and well as by a miracle and so delivering us from the ravages of our enemies we dub thee Sir Jack protector of the realm.
Rise, Sir Jack.
May you serve this court with honor as did your father before you.
- So be it.
- Amen.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
- What is it, Chancellor?
We must talk privately at once.
- Can't it wait?
- This is very important.
Very well.
Attend Sir Jack, daughter.
I'll return presently.
Congratulations upon your knighthood, Sir Jack.
- I'm so proud of you, Jack.
- Sir Jack now.
I'm honored to shake your hand, Sir Jack.
At long last, a hero in the court who is young.
And handsome.
It's a bit warm here.
Would you mind seeing me to the terrace, Sir Jack?
Certainly, Princess.
Thank you for rescuing me.
You saved my life once, remember?
Hail to Sir Jack1
To Jack the Giant Killer.
Hail, Sir Jack, hail, Sir Jack.
I think my rescuer has acquired a new name.
I seem to have acquired more than a new name.
It's a great honor.
I only hope I can be worthy of it.
That's my father's way of thanking you.
This is mine.
I shall immediately go out and find another giant to slay.
Before breakfast?
Know also that these ageless giants with horns and satyr-like features who roam our Cornwall countryside destroy and plunder at the bidding of their master, Pendragon.
These records were lost among the archives of your father's reign.
I've only just uncovered them.
Then this Prince Elidorus is really Pendragon in disguise.
The prince of witches.
But why would he want to seize the princess?
Why?
If we knew that, we'd know what to do.
There's only one thing we can do.
We were fortunate this time, but Pendragon is certain to make another attempt.
I'm going to entrust you with the most important mission ever given to a Cornish knight to protect the life of the princess until she's safe.
I will certainly try to be worthy of your trust, Sire, but is one guard enough?
Our only defense is secrecy.
There aren't enough men in all Cornwall to protect the life of the princess should her whereabouts become known to Pendragon.
At dawn, you and Elaine, disguised as peasants will travel to a convent in Normandy.
When the princess is safely within its walls you will return here.
That means I'm to live in exile.
It won't be easy, Father.
Believe me, Elaine, it's the only way.
Very well, Father.
I'm ready to do whatever's best.
Go now.
Prepare yourself for the journey.
Good night, Father.
Good night, my dear.
We have plans to make and the dawn comes much too soon.
You'd better go now.
It's getting late.
Is there anything more I can do for you, mistress?
No, nothing more, Lady Constance.
I shall miss you.
And I shall pray for your safe journey.
We'll send word as soon as it's safe to return to Cornwall.
Take care of her, Jack.
No one will harm her while I live, Your Majesty.
Quiet, Gaunt, quiet.
We have a mission for you at last a most interesting mission.
Patience, patience.
Patience.
Fly straight and true, Gaunt.
Our master will be most eager for your message.
Master.
Master, Black Prince.
Look, it has come from the castle.
So you finally decided to visit us, eh, Gaunt?
Bringing a little present.
She sails with the morning tide.
What kind of a voyage is it to be, eh, Tubo?
Smooth and tranquil?
All right, lads, bear a hand on that halyard.
You, man, lay a hand there.
Heave.
Heave.
Lay your backs into it, lads.
Heave.
Heave.
Heave.
How goes it, Captain?
Fair skies and a sparkling breeze.
No man could ask for better.
I haven't seen miss Elaine since mid-morn.
Nor I.
She's not in her cabin.
Probably with the helmsman.
Come on, mind the wheel, Jack.
Peter!
Aye, Father.
Have you seen our lady passenger?
Aye, she's here with me.
Well, come up and lend a hand, lad.
We've got a landfall to make.
Aye, Captain.
He's a fine lad, your son.
That he is and smart as paint.
And he can haul a jib as proper as any man aboard.
Here you are, son.
Take over the helm.
I'll get a bite to eat.
Jack, you can give Miss Elaine her first glance at the continent.
Thank you, Captain.
Oh, you can see much better from up there, off the larboard.
Helmsman, keep her teeth in the wind.
Aye, Captain.
I didn't realize we were so close to shore.
This makes it even closer.
Do you want to look?
It's already too close.
Soon I'll be in the convent, and you'll be going back.
I'll be alone.
The sisters will take good care of you.
It's been such a wonderful voyage just the two of us.
I wish I didn't have to go into hiding that I could stay as a make-believe peasant girl.
I wish I were a genie to make your wish come true.
Suppose you were?
What would you do?
I would turn myself into a great prince and I would search every farm and village of England until I found you.
Then I would hold you and tell you that I love you.
And I would answer that I love you.
But it wouldn't be make-believe,
Jack, because it's true.
And then we'd fly away on my magic carpet and live happily together forever after.
Jack.
All right, lads, heave.
Heave.
- Ho.
- Heave.
- Ho.
All right, lay your backs to it, lads.
Heave.
- Ho.
Pipe the captain.
All hands lay to.
What happened?
Captain!
Rocks, Captain.
We've run aground.
- Mid-channel?
There are no rocks here.
- All hands lay to.
- Are you all right, lad?
- Aye.
- What did we hit?
I don't know, look at the sky.
It's turning dark.
- And we've stopped moving.
- It's unnatural.
Captain, look aloft.
Witches.
Who is it, Captain?
This voyage is accursed.
- It's the work of the devil.
- It's the devil himself.
Devil or witch or whatever you are, you may have the wind on me now, but you'll not scuttle my ship.
Witches.
We're doomed.
- Run for you lives.
- Witches, witches.
Witches.
Come with me.
Peter, up here.
- Witches.
Father, here.
Lock the door and let no one in.
- Witches.
- Witches, witches.
Witches.
A witch.
Captain, Captain.
More witches on the quarter deck.
Witches.
Sail across my bow, will you?
Father.
Father.
Jack.
Jack, Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Look.
Jack.
Jack, Jack!
No.
No.
No.
No!
No!
Elaine!
The witches, they're going.
Father!
- We're moving.
- Look, it's getting light.
Captain.
Let's head for home.
They mustn't turn back the ship.
Captain.
Back to England it is, lads.
Make ready to come about.
Bosun, I'm taking command of this ship.
Oh, you are?
You hear that, lads?
Our passenger's taking command of the ship.
- In His Majesty's name.
- In His Majesty's name.
And where would our Royal
Highness wish us to sail him?
We're going to save the girl.
His Majesty can have this blasted tub as soon as we're safe ashore at Cornwall.
As for me, I'll not sail in the wake of those accursed witches.
Turn to, we're going go.
Listen, you men.
Sail to England and you'll all swing from the gallows.
Elaine is the royal princess of Cornwall.
Aye, and I'm the caliph of Baghdad.
Well, then, throw him overboard.
Over the side.
Over the side.
I'll get you.
Jack, Jack!
Jack!
O Isis, keeper of the magic flame, behold thy shrouded minions, demons of the dark assembled to prepare before the altar of thy eternal flame a neophyte to serve thee in thy mystic labyrinth.
Behold O Isis the eye of ancient Egypt.
Awake, Princess of Cornwall.
Open thine eyes.
Gaze deep within the sacred orb of egypt.
Bathe your innermost soul in the magic flame.
Now let the blood in your veins intermingle with the blood of the ancient spirits of the dark nether world.
Behold yourself in the mirror.
Now are you one of the mystic coven of witches.
The court of His Exalted Majesty
King Mark of Cornwall is now in session.
Let the stranger approach the throne.
Pendragon.
You dare to come here?
Guards!
I detect a chill in your hospitality, but perhaps Your Majesty does not wish to hear of the whereabouts of the royal princess?
He couldn't possibly know about Elaine.
Approach the throne.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Speak forth, Black Prince.
I merely wish to inform Your Majesty that your daughter did not reach the convent as you planned.
What have you done with her?
Where is she?
Only I know that.
I don't believe you.
You're lying.
Do you think so?
Behold.
Elaine.
Elaine.
Do you really think I am so stupid as to bring the girl herself?
That illusion was merely to prove to you that I have her in reality.
My daughter is she safe?
Perfectly, at my castle.
What is it that you want of me?
My terms are simple.
Merely that you abdicate within a week.
You may take your chancellor and any aides that you require and leave
England, never to return.
But who will rule my country, govern my people?
You?
On the contrary.
The next in legal succession will ascend the throne.
Her coronation will take place immediately after your abdication.
You mean my daughter will become queen?
You see?
My terms are generous, are they not?
With you by her side to advise her?
That may be as may be.
You have one choice to make, King Mark.
Your daughter or your throne.
In a week, I shall return for your answer.
You hold my daughter, witch, but we hold you!
Seize him.
One week, King Mark no more.
How could he have known of our plans?
Outside of the two of us?
Lady Constance!
Except for the princess and Jack only we three knew we were sending Elaine away.
Surely, you don't think it was I?
Look into that mirror.
No, no.
According to legend, if you're a witch the mirror will reflect your true soul.
All right, it was I who told the master.
Break the mirror.
Break the spell.
Oh.
Oh, forgive me.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Forgive me, forgive me.
We do not blame you, Constance.
- Forgive me.
- We pity you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Ahoy on board!
Help!
Ahoy!
Help!
Strange fish in the sea today.
Ah.
Here, drink.
All of it.
It's good, Sigurd, after it's down.
We were trying to remember if you'd ever seen these witches.
Oh, the witches.
Yeah.
Ah, I sailed these waters under Eric the Red.
Sailed in 50 ships, we did, to conquer Ireland.
Oh, it was wonderful the fighting, the plundering.
Yes, but did you ever see the witches?
Oh, the witches, the witches.
These old eyes have seen many strange sights.
Once when Eric the Red and I were sailing south we saw a school of dragons in the sea.
Yes, but these witches were in the sky and their leader had three horns on his head.
And he carried a pitchfork.
- A pitchfork?
- That shot blue flames.
Blue flames?
Sounds like
Tubo the warlock to me,
Pendragor's witch from across the sea.
Yeah?
What was that?
The imp of the bottle.
I fished him up in my nets one day.
He claims to have great powers, but he will do nothing for me.
Have a care.
Just a moment.
You ugly mean devil.
Couldn't you wait?
I asked for nothing.
And nothing you'll get, you murderous Viking.
Me power's reserved for one to me liking.
A little toy man.
Insulting a leprechaun.
A toy, you say?
Oh, for that there'll be the devil to pay.
Now hush up and listen.
Jack here is a good and true lad with with a just cause.
There's a princess to be rescued from the witches and I need help.
A noble aim, if spoken true.
Pick up the bottle I dare you to.
A caution if you've told a lie the glass will glow, and your hand will fry.
Faith, and after a thousand years at last an honest man appears.
Have you been in there that long?
He was imprisoned by the king of elves for dabbling in the black arts.
I'd finished me work, me shoes heeled and sewn.
All I did was to make me these boots out of gold.
Not just boots, seven-league boots.
Made out of the old pot of gold, you baboon to go around the world and over the moon.
You'll help me, then?
These magic coins will aid your mission if you'll agree to one condition.
When they're gone, there are only three you'll smash the glass and set me free.
It's a bargain, then.
♪ For his island we'll sail to twist Pendragor's tail ♪
♪ And the princess we'll save from that horrible knave ♪
♪ I'm off on a fling, I'll get out of this thing ♪
♪ A free man I'll be, oh, tralura tralee ♪
At least we're here, thanks to the imp.
Now to find out where he's hiding Elaine.
You think it wise for you to go alone?
I think there's less chance of being discovered.
Suppose you're caught, Jack?
We'll see if our little friend here is as good as he says he is.
Who led you safely across the brine?
You do your part, I'll do mine.
Ah.
I'd put my trust in that sword.
We'll see.
Remember to put some fresh water aboard.
Be careful, Jack.
Good luck.
We don't often have visitors.
A clever lad.
How would he fair, do you suppose against our castle's defenses?
It would be a most diverting spectacle to see.
You cannot fight these men with stone.
Look about you, seize a bone.
A bone, to fight them?
A bone to fight their magic might.
A bone to get a fairer fight.
Don't be asking questions, dunce.
Seize the bone now, at once.
Thanks, imp.
Thank me later, on the ship.
Right now, get cracking with that whip.
A magic whip.
This alters things.
He must be dealt with differently.
Enter, lad, enter.
Don't look back in that direction.
I'll take care of your protection.
Welcome to castle Pendragon.
I had a sample of your welcome outside.
I must compliment you on your valor, young man.
First you vanquished Cormoran, my giant.
Then you found your way to this island, a feat in itself.
And just now you lashed at and destroyed my dragon men with your magic whip, a stroke of genius.
A real tragedy to have come so far only to suffer failure.
You're so sure I have failed?
I am, indeed.
For you see, if you take one step toward me horns will sprout from your head.
A second step, and you will develop cloven hooves and walk on all fours.
A third step and the transformation will be complete.
You will have become a black ram.
So, you see?
Your sword can be an antidote to give you a cashmere coat.
Hold it 'fore you as you go, hilt above and point below.
No horns.
No hooves.
No wool.
Defeated, did you say, witch?
Please, let us dispense with theatricalities.
My powers are obviously completely without effect against your own.
Therefore, I yield to the inevitable.
I'm curious, how do you acquire such potent forces?
The princess.
- She is not here.
- Produce her, or die.
- She's not in the castle.
- Then where?
On the other side of the island there are the ruins of a little Roman temple.
She is imprisoned there.
Have her brought to me at once.
If you wish to free the princess you must go there.
How do I know I can trust you?
Aren't we rather forced to trust each other?
There seems no other way.
Very well.
But make no attempt to trick me.
Master, your magic what's happened?
Princess.
Out of my way, you yelping dogs, and let me think.
Never have I failed to turn a mere mortal into a cringing beast.
But he was able to withstand the strength of my magic.
It was the sword, Master.
The burning sword.
It was not only the sword, you fool.
Have you forgotten the magic whip?
He has a strange power, perhaps some ancient talisman of the black arts.
We must find the secret of this power.
Perhaps I can help.
He doesn't know I'm one of you.
Perhaps you can.
Garna.
- Yes, Master?
Take her to the ruined temple.
Yes, Master.
There you will appear to him as the princess Elaine.
- Princess, it's all right.
- Jack.
You're safe now.
Dear Jack, I prayed you'd come.
I have a boat on the beach waiting to take us back to England.
Can you walk?
I'll be all right.
Ahoy, Sigurd, Peter.
The cask is gone.
They must still be looking for water.
Well, they'll be returning soon.
I'd better make ready to sail.
I never thought I'd see you again, Jack or that I'd ever leave this island alive.
We had the luck of the Irish on our side.
Surely it would take more than luck to defeat Pendragon.
Luck and the secret of my magic weapon.
- You mean this?
- The sword?
No.
That's just Sigurd's rusty old blade.
I was talking about my friend, the imp of the bottle.
He's a leprechaun, imprisoned in the bottle by a magic spell.
We both owe him everything.
Oh, such pretty words you'd better stay till we are safe and far away.
Is there something wrong, Princess?
I guess being chained out there for so long I'm cold.
We can wait in the cabin.
This'll warm you.
Is there anything, some hot tea to drink?
Well, this brew of
Sigurd's isn't exactly fit for a princess but it is warming.
I'll pour it.
Get another cup, Jack.
We'll drink together to our escape from this island.
That I will gladly do.
I wish Peter were here to celebrate with us.
Yes, and Sigurd, too.
You'll like him.
Thank you, Princess.
To a safe voyage home.
And to us.
To a happy future.
You and I together, Jack, for the rest of our lives.
To us.
To us.
All right, to us.
Oh, it's strange to feel happy at a time like this, but when we set...
What's the matter, Jack?
I don't know.
Suddenly I feel strange, as if I were going to...
Fresh air.
She must be evil, the bottle's hot.
She pretends to be what she is not.
Watch it there!
Don't rock the ship.
Saints preserve us, I'm going to slip!
Ahoy on board.
Sigurd!
Jack, Jack.
Sigurd, come here, quick.
Your imp stands between me and the throne of Cornwall.
Where is he?
You have great magic powers.
Find him yourself.
Yes, I will.
Only twice in my existence have I been thwarted, once by Herla the wizard and this second time by you.
Herla is dead.
Yes, and I will die, too, rather than betray my king.
I shall hope to make you change your mind.
Garna.
- Yes, Master?
Peter, Sigurd.
For the last time, where is the imp?
Release the Viking.
I am afraid you were not sufficiently impressed on your first visit.
I'll give you a new demonstration of my powers.
Sigurd.
Now the boy.
Look at me.
Stop it.
Jack!
Peter!
Wait.
Jack, tell him, please.
I can't.
Look at me.
Peter, Peter!
And now, my dear, you are next.
What do you suppose would be most fitting?
A serpent?
Or perhaps a toad?
Or would you prefer to tell me where you have hid the imp?
Your loyalty to your king is touching, but your allegiance to the princess is another matter.
You have...
You have until these sands run out to convince your knight that he is being most unwise.
Garna.
I advise you, consider carefully.
Please, Jack, tell him where you hid the imp.
You've got to to save us all.
Is that why you drugged me, to get the imp?
I did it to save your life.
He threatened to kill you if I refused.
He was watching every move.
He'll kill you now if you don't tell him where you hid the imp.
Then I'll have to die because I don't know where the imp is.
You really don't know?
It's the truth, Princess.
I don't know.
You were a fool to come here, Jack.
Your fate was sealed the moment you set foot on this island.
The only thing that kept you alive was the imp.
As soon as the master returns, you die, all of you.
Princess, you are bewitched.
Break the mirror before it's too late.
Break the spell he cast over you.
Untie me!
Help me before it's too late.
And what would you save me from,
Prince Charming, my reflection?
Look at me.
Gaze upon my true self.
Am I not beautiful?
Why be the princess of Cornwall when I can be queen of all England?
Think of it.
How exciting.
A witch on the throne of England.
I forgot.
Pity you won't be there.
Peter, Peter.
That's right.
Come over here and untie me.
Over here, untie me quickly.
No!
No!
No!
Get away from there.
Get back in your cage.
Please, let him be.
Master!
Pendragon, help!
Help me, Pendragon.
Master.
Help me!
Help.
Master, no, no.
No, Master.
No, please.
No!
- Sorry, Princess.
Master!
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Garna, quickly.
Pendragon.
Master, the cage it's empty, too.
This would explain it.
Flaming gauntlets live.
Fight.
Wait.
There's a secret passage out of the castle this way.
Hurry.
No matter.
They cannot reach the boat.
Jack, Jack, come back!
The boat is just beyond those rocks.
Run for the rocks!
It's a matter of a few moments now.
At least we're safe in here.
Not at high tide.
Ahoy there, you, whoever you be, get me out of this boiling sea!
The imp.
Peter, give it to me, quick.
Hurry, imp, your last good deed.
Do it now.
- Please, hurry.
Beware of her.
She'll change your features like she did those other creatures.
She was under Pendragor's spell, but it's broken now.
Hurry, your magic.
In all the kingdom under the sea there's just one creature might set you free.
Well, throw the coin.
Call him.
Master, they're making for the boat.
Out of my way.
Master, they're escaping.
Give me room.
Can't you help us, just once more?
Oh, I would if I could, but you've had your three.
Look at me purse.
It is empty, see?
No, Jack!
Jack!
Jack, help!
Jack, Jack.
Help!
Jack!
Jack.
Jack.
Peter.
Sigurd.
How wonderful.
- Jack, come on.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Come on.
Sigurd.
Ah, Peter, you're restored, too.
When you killed Pendragon, it broke the spell over us.
And look at his castle.
Destroyed forever.
You'll find dry clothes in the cabin.
Just a minute.
I have a promise to fulfill.
You got a hammer?
Here, see?
Be careful, don't hurt him.
Will you be still and calm your fears?
I've been waiting 10 hundred years.
Now, watch the glass.
Just a minute.
Have a care.
The bottle turn it, give me air.
- Sorry, I was only...
- Never mind the lame excuse.
Break the glass and then let me loose.
Little imp, you're free.
Free at last, to breathe and bend thanks to you, me noble friend.
For you, Elaine, some sound advice.
Opportunity knocks, but never twice.
So if it's happiness you'd woo marry Jack.
He's the lad for you.
I intend to.
The little people are waiting for me in Ireland there, across the sea.
Ah, it is a beautiful place, the fairest of fair and me seven-league boots will get me there.
So bless you all and have no fear.
Your course for home will soon be clear.
He's gone.
What did he mean about our course?
Look, over there, in the sky.
If your homeward way you'd wend follow the rainbow to its end.
- Goodbye, imp.
- Goodbye, imp.
- Good luck.
- He was a loyal friend.
I'll miss him.
Come boy, we must get on our course.
She doesn't answer to the helm very well.
Oh, she will do to get us back to England.
To England and home.

THE BLACK HAlR
In old Kyoto there was a young samurai who had been reduced to poverty by the ruin of his lord.
He decided to leave his home and take service with the governor of a distant province.
Goodbye.
Stay well. I can't live here with you. I have a future.
For men, advancement is the most important.
I can't give it up just because of you.
I can't bury my future here.
Must you leave Kyoto?
I'll work harder than before.
I'll weave day and night.
I'll slave for a better living.
If I lose this chance,
I'll be finished.
Don't try to stop me. The new post will bring me fortune.
If you can remarry a man of some distinction, you'll have fortune too.
There's nothing more to say.
I've had enough of poverty!
You're going to leave early in the morning.
So you better go to bed now.
Take her to the bridal chamber.
My daughter is finally married.
I feel relieved now.
I'm glad to have you in my family.
Thank you.
He knows his obligation.
He'll serve her well.
Please, take care of my daughter.
Yes.
The samurai could not understand the value of love.
He divorced his good wife and married the daughter of a noted family to gain position.
And he took her to his new post.
It was the thoughtlessness of youth and the experience of desire.
His second marriage did not prove a happy one.
His new wife was selfish and callous.
He soon found every cause to recall with regret his Kyoto days.
Then he discovered he still loved his first wife -
Ioved her more than he could ever love his second.
And he began to realise how unfair and how ungrateful he had been.
Memories of a woman he had wronged - her gentle speech. her smile. her pretty dainty ways. her impeccable patience...
... continuously haunted him.
I quit!
The same old game!
I'm tired of it!
Girls, you're dismissed.
You better go to bed now.
Your husband is still reading.
How ungrateful you are!
You've gained position because of my family's social prestige.
You only used me.
You're always cherishing your old memories.
You're walking out on me!
The dew won't help.
Please, go to your bedroom and nurse her ladyship.
Nurse her? That's your duty.
Don't say that.
She may return to her parents tomorrow if she wants to.
I can't stand seeing her dissatisfied look any more.
Tell her so.
After all, I was young and thoughtless.
I'll find my ex-wife whom I deserted and make amends for my sinful act.
The years went by.
And his official term expired.
It was September 10th when he reached the street of Kyoto where his first wife used to live.
It was midnight and the city was as silent as a cemetery.
When did you come back to Kyoto?
Now. Just now.
How did you find your way to me, through all those black rooms?
Stay seated.
Don't bother.
I'll get supper.
I don't want it.
You haven't changed a bit.
You look just like you did before.
Your face that I couldn't forget for a moment... and your voice that was so dear to me!
Forgive me.
I was cruel. I was a fool.
I deserve your hatred.
Until the day my official term expired, how I longed to come back to you!
How deeply I regretted my selfishness!
How wretched I was without you!
How I loathed myself for divorcing you!
How long I've hoped and planned to make amends!
As soon as I became free.
I wanted to come back to Kyoto and find you.
I hurried here in the dark.
It's very kind of you thinking about me so much.
Forgive me.
Please forgive me.
I was such a fool!
Don't reproach yourself.
It's wrong to allow yourself to suffer on my account.
I always felt that I wasn't worthy of being your wife.
Don't...
I knew that, but I couldn't help trying to be near you.
Anyway, it was very cruel of me to have divorced you.
It was because of poverty.
While you lived with me, you were always kind.
Why should I think ill of you?
I prayed for your good fortune every day and night.
I'll make amends.
Forget it.
You came a long way home.
What greater happiness than to see you again... even if only for a moment?
Only for a moment!
Make it the length of seven lifetimes!
Unless you forbid it,
I'll live with you always... always!
Nothing shall ever separate us again.
Your fragrant hair!
It's the same as before.
The same glossy hair... dark eyes...
Iovely nose... soft cheeks... and...
I've forgotten my sorrow.
Many things have happened in Kyoto since you went away.
I imagine so.
I can't tell you everything in a night.
Soon it'll be dawn.
Yes. This room is very dear to me.
It was our bridal chamber.
We spent several nights here.
I don't want to sleep now.
I want to talk of the past and the present and the future with you and feel as happy as I am now.
I also feel as if this were a dream.
I don't want to sleep for a moment so I can keep you forever.
THE WOMAN OF THE SNOW
In a village of Musashi Province there lived two woodcutters:
Mosaku and Minokichi.
Mosaku was an old man and Minokichi. his apprentice. was a boy of eighteen.
Everyday. they went to a forest a few miles away from the village.
One cold day. a great snowstorm overtook them on their way home.
The boatman had left his boat on the other side of the river.
It was no day for swimming.
I intended to treat you like the other man.
But I couldn't help feeling pity for you because you're so young.
You're a handsome boy.
I will not hurt you now.
But if you ever tell anybody - even your own mother about what you've seen tonight,
I'll know it.
And then I'll kill you.
Remember that.
Understand?
I'll be going now.
We sell wood for a living.
You can't work for some time, not before spring.
The terrible cold night made you ill.
Eat the porridge.
Take care of yourself, son.
Or you'll be frozen and dead like that old Mosaku whose blood was all gone.
If this happens to you again, you won't survive.
Are you listening?
You've said nothing about that night.
A year passed.
As soon as he got well. he resumed working.
Every morning. he went to the forest alone and returned with bundles of wood after sunset.
Where are you going in the evening?
Edo.
Now?
Yes.
I lost my parents.
My relatives in Edo might help me find work as a servant.
Brothers?
None?
You'd need connections to find work in Edo.
Is it so hard to get work when you don't know anyone?
You could get married...
With you?
Come!
That's my house.
Why don't you take a rest?
There's nobody you have to mind.
But...
Only my mother and I live there.
Come!
Your name is Yuki?
I see, I see.
Going to Edo alone sounds very dangerous.
People are not always kind.
Young girls must be careful not to be bothered by bad men.
Come eat while it's hot.
And Yuki bore him three children. handsome and very fair of skin.
She acquired a fame for being a good wife among the villagers.
T ake a moment to reflect on Grandma's grave.
Show her you've grown up.
Give her your flowers.
It seems she never gets old.
Really.
She's as young today as on the day she first came into the village.
She's a wonder.
Were you at the grave?
Yes. It's my mother-in-law's memorial day.
That's good.
She must be pleased to see her nice grandchildren praying for her.
She's happy.
She died praising her son's wife.
It's not very common.
No.
Usually, a mother-in-law talks ill of her son's wife.
No matter how good the wife is.
That's not true.
Thanks to you, I'm happy.
What a happy couple, you and your husband!
He must be happy.
He has such a good and beautiful woman for a wife.
Naturally.
What a young wife!
Most peasant women age early after having three children.
She still looks like a girl.
She's a wonder.
Put them on.
Is it too small?
And the children's?
I made them.
How nice! All ready... the sandals for the holiday season!
If the thongs are too tight,
I'll fix them.
Now try them on.
Yes.
How beautiful!
Why the red thongs?
You're still young.
I'm a mother of three children.
Red is still your colour.
Your feet look beautiful.
It fits well.
Not too tight, not too lose.
It's exactly my size.
Your sandals look beautiful and sturdy so people come to you for special orders.
This pair is exceedingly good.
I made them so that they'll match your kimono.
As if I were going away on a journey!
I can't buy you a new kimono, so at least you have sandals.
With your sandals and my kimono our children will have a wonderful holiday.
How is it going?
A few more stitches.
Why are you watching me so intently?
I just remembered that night ten years ago.
It's strange to recall it now after so many years.
You're sewing with the light on your face and I'm looking up at you like this.
That's why I remembered that night...
What night?
A strange thing happened that night.
I can remember it well as if it happened yesterday.
I was eighteen then. I never told anybody about that night.
I'm not sure it was real or a dream.
It was the night that old Mosaku was frozen dead as if his blood were all gone.
I saw with my own eyes a woman who was bending over him.
And she was blowing her breath like a white smoke upon him.
Then he became stiff and couldn't move.
That woman stooped over me, too.
And I got almost numb.
Then, the eyes of the horrible woman
Iooked very, very beautiful.
She was so beautiful and white like you.
Yes!
You looked exactly like her just now.
That's why I remembered.
Once the memory haunted me day and night.
I became sick after that.
I tell you, it was when I spent the terrible snowstormy night in the ferryman's hut.
I saw very clearly the weird woman who killed old Mosaku.
I've never seen in my life a woman as beautiful and white as her except you.
Of course, she's not a human being and I was afraid of her.
She was the Woman of the Snow who was hungry for warm blood...
...or a dream.
...or a dream.
Not a dream.
I...
It was me.
Me!
Me!
It was Yuki.
You promised that night you'd never tell anybody.
You finally broke the promise.
It was a pledge for life for both of us.
I told you if you broke it,
I would kill you.
You betrayed me!
Ah, if it were not for those children asleep there
I would kill you this moment!
From now on you'd better take good care of those children.
If they have any reason to complain about you
I'll treat you as you deserve!
HOlCHl, THE EARLESS
The time had come.
It was dawn on March 24th in Year 1 of the Genryaku era (1 1 85)
The armies of the Genji and Heiké clans were determined to fight one last time at Dan-no-ura, off Kyushu in the Shimonoséki Strait.
Procurator Kanzo from Kumano had hoisted the Kongo-Doji flag and placed on the frontline the boats belonging to Kawanano Michinobu, inhabitant of the Province of Lyo.
He'd decided to side with the Genji with his warriors, on board two hundred ships.
Once upon a time... or maybe twice, there was an unearthly paradise called...
Pepperland.
80,000 leagues beneath the sea it lay, or lie, I'm not too sure.
Pepperland is a tickle of joy on the blue belly of the universe.
It must be scratched.
Right, Max?
- Yes, Your Blueness.
- What?!
We Meanies only take no for an answer.
Is that understood, Max?
No, Your Blueness.
That's better.
Are the troops in readiness?
No, your Blueness.
- The Bonkers?
- No.
- Clowns?
- No.
- Snapping Turks?
- No.
- Anti-music missiles?
- No.
- The dreadful Flying Glove?
- No.
Splendid!
Today, Pepperland goes bluely!
Fire!
The Meanies are coming!
The Meanies are coming!
Glove, Glove, come here, Glove!
Look out there, and what do you see?
- Tell him, Max.
- Someone running, Glove.
Well, you'll soon put a stop to that, won't you, Glovey?
Go, Glove, point!
And having pointed, pounce down!
I haven't laughed so much since Pompeii!
What?! What?!
The Glove is losing his touch.
Do your worst!
Explode them!
It's not polite to point!
Thing of beauty... destroy it for ever!
Sir, Sir, the Blue Meanies are coming!
Not here, Young Fred.
They wouldn't dare.
They would. They are.
What are you going to do?
Finish the quartet.
Fire!
Trio, sir?
Duet, sir?
Duet?
Solo!
Young Fred, the Blue Meanies are coming!
4 scores and 32 bars ago,
- our forefathers...
- Our quartet?
- And foremothers...
- Another quartet?
Made it in this yellow submarine...
- What, that little thing?
- To Pepperland.
Climb aboard, Young Fred.
But, sir, I can't even make my soap float.
I'm appointing you Lord Admiral.
Lord Admiral?
In that event, yes.
Hurry, Young Fred.
Go! Get help!
Where should I go?
No time for trivialities.
Woe... is me.
Liverpool can be a lonely place on a Saturday night.
And this is only Thursday morning.
Compared with my life,
Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl.
Nothing ever happens to me.
I feel like an old, splintered drumstick.
I'd jump into the River Mersey, but it looks like rain.
Nothing ever happens to me.
Puss, puss-puss.
Puss, puss, puss. Here, pussy.
Here, pussy, pussy, pussy.
Here, pussy, pussy.
Ahem, er...
Would you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a yellow submarine?
No, I would not.
Oh yeah, I didn't think you would.
I could have sworn there was a yellow submarine.
But that isn't logical, is it?
It must have been one of them unidentified flying cupcakes or a figment of my imagination.
But I don't have an imagination.
Help, help, help!
Thanks, I don't need any.
Help! Won't you please, please help me?
Be specific.
...Blue Meanies!
What you need is...
'H' for hurry, 'E' for ergent,
'L' for love me and 'P' for p-p-please help.
Hiya, baby!
Your story has touched my heart.
Jump in, we'll get my friends.
- Bless you!
- Did I sneeze?
- Just park it here.
- I'll just park it here.
What would your friends be doing here?
Displaying.
- Displaying what?
- Displaying around.
Can't we take one of these?
No. I only work with my mates.
Frankenstein?
I used to go out with his sister.
- His sister?
- Yeah. Phyllis.
Hey, I wonder what would happen if I pulled this lever.
You mustn't do that.
Can't help it.
I'm a born lever-puller.
Ringo, I've just had the strangest dream.
I warned you not to eat on an empty stomach.
Now listen to Old Fred.
...Blue Meanies!
What do you think?
I think he needs a rehearsal.
When do we leave?
Let's get the other two, John.
- What day is it?
- Sitarday.
Then George will be here.
George, what are you doing up there?
Now, what is it, Ringo?
Is there a matter you'd like to take up or down?
This chap here...
...Blue Meanies!
You're nuts, the pair of you.
Wait a minute, that's my car.
- How do you know it's your car?
- I'd know it anywhere.
- What's it look like, then?
- It's red with yellow wheels.
I mean, blue with orange wheels.
It's all in the mind.
- Move over, I'm driving.
- I got here first.
- I'll drive, if you like.
- No, you sit in the middle.
- I'm sitting in the middle.
- You said you were driving.
- I am driving.
- I'll get in the back, then.
Do you think we're interrupting something?
I think so.
We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?
It's all in the mind.
Try one of those doors.
Yes, they do look very nice, don't they?
Yes, they do.
- They do, though, don't they?
- Yes, they do.
- Don't dey, dough?
- Dough?
- Don't ask.
- Dat's dough.
What's the matter, fellas?
Blue Meanies?
Well, lads, what do you think?
I think that...
Remember, there'll be rough seas ahead.
So, what do you think?
Well, then, um...
Pounding, overwhelming waves.
What do you think of that?
- Well, I think that...
- As a matter of fact, I...
I think...
- Well?
- I've forgotten.
Right, then, let's get this vessel shipshape.
I kind of like the way it is, submarine shape.
So, this is a submarine.
Soft, isn't it?
Not if you're on the bottom.
All right, lads, time to stow the gab and turn to.
Groovy. How do you start this thing?
It starts with a Blue Meanie attack.
Supposing there's no Blue Meanies in the neighbourhood?
Then you start looking for a switch.
Perhaps this is it.
What time is it?
It's time for time.
Look, the hands are slowing down.
- Do you ever get the feeling...
- Yeah.
That things aren't as rosy as they appear to be under the surface?
What's happening, John?
In my humble opinion, we've become involved in Einstein's time-space continuum theory.
- Relatively speaking, that is.
- Of course.
- Maybe time's gone on strike.
- What for?
- Shorter hours.
- I don't blame it.
It must be very tiring being time, mustn't it?
- Why?
- It's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it?
- You surprise me, Ringo.
- Why?
- Dealing in abstracts.
- Just because I'm a drummer...
- I don't half feel funny.
- You're not half the lad you used to be.
Look, everything's getting bigger.
It's not.
It's us that are getting smaller...
- I want my mam.
- And younger.
There you are, lads.
Old Fred will get you out of all this.
Look at that!
- It's all a load of Father Xmas's.
- It's not. It's Father Time.
- How do you know?
- I read it in a book.
I don't want to alarm you, but the years are going backwards.
What's that mean, Old Fred?
If we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we'll all disappear up our own existence.
- What are we gonna do, then?
- We could always try a few buttons.
I want my mam.
Time's fast running out for us,
I'm afraid.
- Can't we do something to the clock?
- What do you mean, John?
Move the hands forward, see what happens.
Clever lad.
Something strange is happening.
It's speeding up now.
Funny... a submarine remarkably like our own.
Uncannily.
There's someone in it. Look.
- And they're waving.
- It's a group of fellas.
Wave back.
Maybe we're both part of a vast yellow submarine fleet.
There's only two of us.
Then I would suggest that yonder yellow submarine is ourselves
- going backwards...
...in time!
Look at Ringo.
Oh dear, we're all the same.
Senile delinquents.
And I can hear my beard growing.
We'd better do something.
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen, but would you agree that we have been passing through the Sea of Time?
That would explain a few things.
I'm glad I'm not young any more.
Or was it old?
- What kind of a sea is this?
- The Sea of Science.
Oh, yeah.
- He looks wrong.
- He doesn't look at all well.
In fact, he's horrible.
He's so ugly.
Really ugly!
Somebody push a button.
- There's a Cyclops.
- Can't be. He's got two eyes.
Then it must be a bi-Cyclops.
- There's another one.
- A whole cyclopedia.
There's a school of whales.
- They look a bit old for school.
- University, then.
- University of Whales.
- They look like dropouts to me.
You've got to steer clear.
- Steer clear?
- Yes, steer. Clear?
Yes, dear.
Now, whatever you do, don't touch that button.
- Which button?
- That one.
This one?
That was the panic button.
- Poor Ringo.
- Poor lad.
Never did no harm to no-one.
Lads, now Ringo's gone, what are we gonna do?
Learn to sing trios.
No, let's save the poor devil.
I see footsteps.
- It's a pair of kinky boot-beasts.
- Preparing to attack.
- I don't half miss Ringo.
- He's far out there.
Always was.
- Here comes Ringo!
- 'H' is for hurry!
There goes Ringo.
It's seen us.
Find a boxing button.
Whoever heard of a boxing button?
Who cares? Find one.
Fire one!
Uh-oh, wrong one.
That.
There goes Ringo again.
- Rides well, doesn't he?
- 'E' is for ergent...
Oh no, not the dreaded vacuum flask again.
- We'll be sucked into oblivion.
- Or even further.
Put her in reverse.
So long, sucker.
- Too much.
- Too soon.
Reverse! Reverse!
- Ringo time.
- 'L' is for love me...
Indians!
Help! Help!
'P' is for please...
So, press a button.
- How was it, Ringo?
- 'Arrowing.
Look who's back.
Full speed ahead.
- Oh, no.
- The motor's packing in.
By all the sea nymphets, we're losing power.
We're being swallowed.
What shall we do?
- Serve tea.
- Lovely.
By Neptune's knickerbockers, she's puttered out.
- Maybe we should call a road service.
- Can't. No road.
And we're not sub-scribers.
Subscribers!
I know something about motors.
Let me have a look.
- Here.
- Is that the motor?
Can't you tell one when you see one?
Of course I can.
Let me peruse it.
- What do you think?
- I think I burned my finger.
Here, lads. Look at this.
- What do you think it is?
- Nothing.
Looks like nothing.
It's a local inhabitant.
He's probably one of the nothings.
At least that's something.
- Let's show him our motor.
- Steady on.
You don't want to show your motor to just anybody.
But this is a nobody.
Medic, pedic, zed oblique, orphic, morphic, dorphic, Greek.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
Can you tell us where we're at?
A true Socratic query, that.
And who the Billy Shears are you?
Who? Who indeed am I?
Jeremy?
Hillary?
Boob?
- Ph. D?
- Who?
Eminent physicist, polyglot, classicist, prize-winning botanist, hard biting satirist,
- talented pianist, good dentist, too.
- Lousy poet.
Critic's voice, take your choice.
- Must be one of them angry young men.
- Or a daffy old creep.
I, daffy old creep?
- Do you speak English?
- Old English, middle, a dialect, pure...
- Well, do you speak English?
- You know, I'm not sure.
He's so smart, he doesn't even remember what he knows.
Why don't we show him our motor?
Should we really... show him our motor?
He may not have seen one before.
Turbo-prop, super-combustible spring.
Metrocyclonic and stereophonic, this motor, I see, has a broken down thing.
- He fixed it.
- He fixed it?
Great. Let's go.
I must complete my bust, two novels, finish my blueprints, begin my beguine.
Must you always talk in rhyme?
If I spoke prose, you'd all find out,
I don't know what I talk about.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
Hey, fellas. Look.
The footnotes for my 19th book.
This is my standard procedure for doing it.
And while I compose it,
I'm also reviewing it.
- A boob for all seasons.
- How can he lose?
Were your notices good?
It's my policy never to read my reviews.
There must be a word for what he is.
Okay, men, all aboard.
Let's go somewhere.
What about him?
He's happy enough going around in circles.
Poor little fella.
I don't know.
Ringo's just a sentimentalist.
Look at him.
Can't he come with us?
Mr. Boob, you can come with us, if you like.
You mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man?
Come on, we'll take you somewhere.
Okay, Booby. Down the hatch.
Down the hatch.
A quite curious phrase.
The middle South Midlands
Victorian phase.
Its usage undoubtedly on the increase.
I must work it into my New Statesman piece.
- That's the hatch, friend.
- Indeed.
Steady now, crew.
Prepare to go forward.
- Forward.
- Forward.
Forward!
It's awfully quiet.
What shall we do, Jeremy?
Repair, revive, revamp, renew.
Ipse dixit, just turn the screw.
- Log sign, clog sign, big thingamabob.
- What's he saying?
- What's he doing?
- Chewing gum will do the job.
A turn of the screw, and all is...
...and all is new.
I can't stop her.
'H' is for hurry, 'E' is for ergent,
'L' is for love me...
'P' is for... goodbye?
- That was lovely, Jeremy.
- We've lost the sub for good.
- Or for bad.
- Or for worse.
- I'm sorry about that.
- But he did fix the motor.
- Where are we?
- It looks like the foothills.
- The foothills of what?
- The foothills of the headlands.
- Carry on, lads, carry on.
- Certainly was carrying on.
- I feel a draft.
- We must be near the Sea of Holes.
Don't you think we should ask somebody for directions?
Excuse us...
Can you tell us the way to Pepperland?
Thanks.
Gosh, look at all this dust!
Where did it come from?
A chemical error and quite imprecise.
This is a condiment...
- Condi...
- A spice.
- He's right, you know. It's pepper.
- Pepper?
Pepper.
John?
Paul?
George?
Is anybody home?
- Where are we?
- A holey sea.
This place reminds me of Blackburn, Lancashire.
Oh, boy...
How many do you think there are in all?
Enough to fill the Albert Hall.
Didn't Old Fred mention something about the Sea of Holes
- just before the Sea of Green?
- Yeah.
Through one of them slots must be the Sea of Green.
But which? Which one?
Thesis, antithesis, synthesis, causes of causal causation.
Jeremy, what do you know about holes?
There are simply no holes in my education.
You mean you haven't composed a whole book?
Great. What shall we do?
Be empirical. Look.
The booby's making more and more sense.
It's getting better all the time.
Great. Come on, let's all look for the Sea of Green.
The Sea of Holes... into the Sea of Green.
Hydrolate, verdant chrysodine.
I think we're near the Sea of Green.
I've got a hole in my pocket.
Where's Jeremy?
He was over there.
- He's not here now.
- He must have jumped ship, then.
He wouldn't do that.
He's our friend.
Booby, Jeremy, Hillary, where are you?
Pepperland.
A bit salty around the edges.
- Looks all dingy.
- And drab.
And quiet.
Safe at last.
And none the worse for our adventures.
Reminiscent in many ways of the late Mr. Ulysses.
There's an eye in the apples.
There she blows!
Lord Mayor, sir...
I've made it, I'm back.
- Who's this?
- Our Lord Mayor.
He's been bonked.
Lord Mayor, sir... unbonk yourself.
Even a little snatch of a tune might get him up again.
All right, let's sing.
Do I hear music?
Do I see... Young Fred?
You do, Lord Mayor.
Bless my metronome.
And did you bring help?
Yes, yes. Look.
Holy pizzicato, Young Fred.
It's quite uncanny, your faces...
We're quite cute, really.
You could pass for the originals.
We are the originals.
No, no... Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band.
They couldn't be much with a name like that.
Sergeant Pepper?
You could impersonate them and rally the land to rebellion.
Where are your instruments?
- Lost in the Monstrous Sea.
- Sea of Monsters.
We'll get other instruments,
Lord Mayor.
Not a chance.
The Meanies captured everything that maketh music.
They hate music that much, do they?
They shrink at the very sound.
Okay, you guys.
It's shrinking time in Pepperland.
Aim, fire!
He reminds me of my old English teacher.
Look, if you must shout, shout quietly.
- What do we do?
- Coagulate with the crowd.
Cut-outs at the ready.
Then let's cut out.
What a grand bandstand.
That's where the gear's kept.
Come on.
Cavey, cavey.
All right, the coast is clear.
Now's our chance.
- But how'll we get over?
- Easy. Follow me.
A-ha! You fools!
It's not very light in here, is it?
Shh! Keep the noise down.
- Look what I found.
- It's their uniforms.
- Nice bit of gear, that.
- They'll look great on, eh?
- Dey will, won't dey?
- Won't dey, dough.
- How do I look?
- Groovy. How about me?
- Bad scene, lads. We're surrounded.
- Oh, heck.
A million billion Meanies.
They're coming this way.
Hide!
- Do you think they heard us?
- I hope not.
- What did you say?
- Shh!
Good plan.
Look. They're all asleep.
They look cute when they're asleep.
Almost human.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- On tiptoe.
- Tiptoe through the Meanies...
- Shh!
Let's exude.
Relax, lads.
Not a Meanie in sight.
- Not even a teeny Meanie.
- Not even a teeny-weeny Meanie.
- Look. Breakfast.
- I'm dying for a bit of brekky.
Look out.
Sound off, one, two, three, four...
- One, two, three, four...
- Five.
Five?
- Sound off, one, two, three...
- Four.
- One, two, three...
- Four.
- One, two...
- Three.
- Three?
- Two.
- Two?
- One.
One?
Are you Bluish?
You don't look Bluish.
Run for it.
Right, men. We've made it.
- Instruments at the ready.
- Okay, on the beat.
A-one, a-two, a-three, a-four, a-five, a-six.
- Can't you make it three?
- All right.
On the beat of three...
A-one, a-two, a-three...
It's wonderful to be here, it's certainly a thrill.
You're such a lovely audience, we'd like to take you home with us.
We'd love to take you home.
- The hills are alive...
...with the sound of music.
Who is responsible for this?
Rimsky Korsakov?
Guy Lombardo?
My dear friend... let us not forget that heaven is blue.
Tomorrow, the world!
Bring in my Bloobers.
- Who?
- Who?
There you are, my little Glovey-dovey.
Go get thee hence and destroy yon upstarts.
Smash them! Squash them!
Crash them!
Oblue-terate them!
Here, your Blueness, have some nasty medicine.
The Glove, the Glove, the Glove!
- Glove?
- Glove?
He's a clever lad, isn't he?
Open your mouth, it won't hurt.
John, you haven't half got a big mouth, haven't you?
It's easy.
All you need is love.
Go, Glove, lovely Glove.
You took the words right out of my mouth, John.
Hey, wait, and watch.
It's all in the mind, you know.
Hey, that's a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl.
In Pepperland, all things are possible.
- It's not a goldfish bowl.
- Just a big glass bowl, then.
- It's blue glass.
- It must be from Kentucky.
There's something inside.
- Four fellas.
- What are they doing there?
They're not having a ball, that's for sure.
- It can't be.
- It's us.
- But we're here.
- It's Sgt. Pepper's...
- Lonely...
- Hearts Club...
Band.
The resemblance is truly striking.
If I could come in here...
I think the theory put forward by Einstein could well be applied here.
The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking two eggs...
- John!
...beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper...
- John!
- George?
- How do we get them out?
- Break the glass.
- We can't. It's Beatle-proof.
- Nothing is Beatle-proof.
Have you got your drumsticks with you?
A drum break might shatter it.
- No, I haven't.
- Have a look in your pocket.
I've got a hole in my pocket.
I wonder if...
Yeah, it still works.
Ringo, we take back all we said.
You're a genius, a sheer genius.
I know, I know, I know.
- Like coloured telly.
- Like crystal.
They're decanting.
Hello, brother.
Yeah, without a doubt.
- We're the spitting image of each other.
- Golly, yeah.
I'm led to believe that you're an extension of my personality.
- Yes, I'm the alter-ego man.
- And I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob.
I'm glad you asked me that.
Because as a matter of fact there's a war on.
Then, brothers in war, to the skirmish must we hence.
Shall we hence?
Let's not waste time sitting on the hence.
Beatles to battle. Charge!
- We're surrounded.
- Nice dog, though.
What do you say?
Sing it.
Do you know any more?
Play it!
Jeremy, can it be you?
Can it be me? I think you'd better inquire of the guards, for when I was captured, they took all my cards.
Shh, that's enough, Jeremy.
- The whole world's being attacked.
- What do you want me to do?
Do you recommend fisticuffs versus the guard?
Oh, guard!
Blue Meanio!
Left to the nostril, right uppercut, right to the eyebrow, left to the gut.
Jeremy!
Come on, Ringo!
Get back! Get back!
Once more unto the breach, dear Meanies!
You're advancing the wrong way!
Retreat backwards!
Get back there now!
My kingdom for a horse!
I think I'll tear him up into little pieces.
He does, does he?
Yes, I think I'll make a blueburger out of him.
Ha-ha, I don't care what you think.
You don't, eh?
We'll soon see about that.
He does in truth seem quite annoyed, some reference material before I'm destroyed.
Where ground is soft most often grows,
Arise, arise, arouse, a rose.
A rosy nose?
Speak your last piece!
Peace, peace, supplant the doom and the gloom.
Turn off what is sour, turn into a flower and bloom, bloom.
Ha-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom, bloom, bloom...
First time I saw that Nowhere Man, that nobody,
- I knew he was somebody.
- You're right.
Hello there, blue people.
Won't you join us?
Buck up, and otherwise go mingle.
- What do you say?
- Max?
Your Blue...
I mean, your Newness!
It's no longer a blue world, Max.
Where could we go?
Argentina?
Are you with us?
Will you join?
- Shall we?
- No!
Yes, your Newness!
- Yes, Max...
- Yes.
Oh, yes is a word with a glorious ring,
A true, universal, euphonious thing.
In genders embracing and chasing of blues, the very best word for the whole world to use. Ha-ha!
Yes, let us mix, Max.
I've never admitted it before, but my cousin is the Bluebird of Happiness.
- Catchy tune, that.
- I can't seem to get it out of my head.
- Then shake it.
- That's what we've been doing all night.
Yeah, it was a great party.
And we brought back lots of lovely souvenirs.
- Here is the motor.
- And I've got a little love.
- And I've got a hole in my pocket.
- A hole?
Half a hole, anyway.
I gave the rest to Jeremy.
What can he do with half a hole?
Fix it to keep his mind from wandering.
Look at John, will you?
What's the matter, John?
Blue Meanies?
Newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre.
There's only one way to go out.
- How's that?
- Singing.
One... two... three... four
Gentlemen? Gentlemen, it's quite true.
The weather continues to defy nature.
Overnight the temperatureat the Arctic has risen 4.9°F.
Gentlemen! Another five degrees...
...and Haifa Harbour is completely under water!
It's true. New York, San
Francisco, NewOrleans,
Marseilles - every port's in danger.
Who is doing this? And why?
- It's the work of madmen.
Mad, sane...
They're brilliant.
They're demonstrating thatthey can control the weather!
Turn wheat belts into deserts, put icebergs in the Mediterranean.
Control the weather, you control the world. - What do they want?
Why haven't they contacted us? - Oh, they will.
But we're not going to wait for them. We've just had our first break.
According to this dispatch I just received, our team of agents has them cornered!
At any second...
It was a trap.
We just lost another team of agents.
They know every move we make! - They have a superb intelligence unit.
How can I find that laboratoryif
I keep losing manpower?
How about 0008? - Unfortunately he is not available.
International narcotics. -
Please. We can't use 0008.
They have a file on all our personnel. Wehave...
...to recruit from outside the organisation.
Well, ifyou'll write down the qualificationsyou believe necessary for the assignment, our computer'll give us the ideal man.
Stand by computers.
Derek Flint! My country awarded himthe Croix de Guerre!
Flint's wrong for this job. - Wasn't he under your command in the war?
Forget it. He can't take orders. - Derek
Flint! Three promotions in a month!
And our Medal of Honor. - I said forget it!
Excellent chap, expert frogman. Name's Derek Flint.
We need a man who can follow regulations!
We need a man who's disciplined!
Flint.
I don't care what these computers say. I know this man. He just...
Yes, sir?
Yeah? Well, uh...
Well, how did you know, sir?
Very well, sir.
Yes, sir. Well, of course, that's your privilege, sir.
Well, ifthat's your wish.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Very good, sir.
Very well, gentlemen, uh... Derek Flint.
Mr Cramden wants...
Mr Flint? General Hawkins.
Mr Cramden wants...
What do you mean, he said no? I sent you...
Yes, sir?
But I sent General Hawkins himself, sir.
Yes, sir. I'll contact Flint personally.
Yes, sir. It'll be a pleasure, sir.
Sir?
Flint...
Lower your hand slowly and smile.
What? - If he senses hostility, he'll rip you apart.
Smile, sir.
Thank you, Caesar.
Well, sir, this is a surprise.
Let me take your hat and coat.
Perhaps nudes aren't your dish oftea.
Have a cigar, sir.
No, thank you.
Breakfast, sir?
I had lunch two hours ago. - Oh,
I must still be on Moscow time.
Moscow? Business? - No. Ballet, sir.
You travelled to Moscow to watch a ballet? - No, to teach.
Do you mind ifwe talk while I shave? - After you.
Flint, I'm here because...-
You want something.
Don't be clever. I came here on orders. - Bonjour, cheri.
Bonjour, baby.
Maybe my office is a better place to talk...- I doubt it, sir.
Well, once you realise the importanceofthis project, I know you'll be interested...
You know the high regard I havefor you and your organisation.
Thank you. - But I think your file on me needs updating.
You see, as of late my interestsare less governmental than personal.
All right for today?
Excellent, carissima.
Later.
Now, Flint, in the pastyou and
I have had our differences of...
Well, discipline is a vital factor...
...that every citizen has got...
Don't wave the flag in the bathroom. Just come to the point.
Excuse me.
Flint, the government needs you.
Yes, well, it's good to be wanted, sir.
This is the most important assignmentever offered!
I hope you find a good man for your project.
Ohayo gozaimasu, Derek.
- Ohayo gozaimasu, honey.
Man does not live by bread alone.
Later.
Now, Flint, every computer designated youthe best man for the job.
That must have pleased you. -
Look, I don't bear a grudge.
I know we've had our disagreements...-
Sir, you know it doesn't work between us.
Later, baby.
Do you want a shave, sir? -
Flint, the world's in trouble!
It usually is, but it managesto extricate itselfwithout my help.
You're still the same old selfish, arrogant...!
Sir, you're getting edgy. - Don't tell me...!
Later!
Yeah?
But l...
Good evening, Monsieur Flint.
Paul, table number one.
Thank you, Maurice. - The pleasure is mine, Monsieur Flint. Merci.
Stand back, folks. Please stand back. Give the man some air. Thank you very much.
Give me that candle.
Why would anyone want to kill Mr Cramden?
I think that dart was meant for me.
It seems I have ajobwhether
I want one or not.
Gentlemen, the new head of ouroperations team, the man you selected,
Derek Flint.
Thank you, gentlemen. I accept this assignment.
Oh, I'm sorry about that crude incision, sir.
Thank you, gentlemen. We'll now have a private briefing.
I owe you my life. The medics said four more seconds...
Three, sir. - Dammit, is there anything you don't know?
A great many things, sir.
Now, ifyou'll excuse me, I'll need a few hours to prepare.
It worries me when he stops his heart.
It's over three hours, isn't it?
Yes, but it does relax him.
Must be a dangerous assignment.
Ladies.
Sakito?
You call Eddie and confirmour seats for the concert.
Gina?
Venison's almost ready to be hung. You'll take care of it?
Leslie.
Call Freddie and postpone my fitting. - Till when?
Wednesday will be all right. - Are you sure?
Of course.
Your code book. - Ifyou don't mind, I'll use my own code.
I'd rather you used this. - Mine's a mathematical progression.
40, 26, 36. It's based on...- I can imagine what it's based on.
Walther PPK with silencer. High velocity, extreme penetrating power.
Yes, it's a very fine weapon.
Tempered steel. Very effective at close range.
But I have no need for these. They're crude.
Dammit, these are the most...
Stopwatch, please.
When I nod, you start the stopwatch.
When I indicate 'stop', stop.
This needle is dipped in curare. How long did it take?
Three tenths of a second.
Now, this contains 65 weapons.
This has 82 different functions.83 ifyou wish to light a cigar.
Chemical analysis ofthat dart.
That's odd.
In addition to the poison, there were traces of garlic, saffron and fennel on the feather.
What proportions, sir? - Propor...? Here.
Marseilles. Bouillabaisse.
Huh?
Throughout the world in thepreparation of bouillabaisse, the proportion of garlic to saffron and fennel...
...is two cloves of garlic to a pinchof saffron to a dash offennel.
Now, only in a certainsmall section of Marseilles...
...are these three condimentsprepared in these proportions.
Whoever handled that dart was inMarseilles within the last 24 hours.
Goodbye, sir.
Hold it, hold it.
These are the men under your command. - I don't need anyone, sir.
You said you'd join the team.
- The team isn'tjoining me.
Dammit, man, for once you'll follow orders!
- This is my mission, sir. I work alone.
Your mission? The US Government isinvolved too, not to mention the world!
It's my show now.
You're under arrest, Flint!
I'm glad to see you kept up your karate, sir.
These men wore Battle ofthe Bulge ribbons.
There's no ribbon for the Battle ofthe
Bulge. - Exactly. They're impostors.
Gridley? He's been with us... That's Gridley!
Sir, ifyou look around the eyes, you'll see some scars.
On the bridge ofthe nose. Plastic surgery.
You've cracked. All this high living - you've cracked.
In here! They're dead! ln here! They're dead!
Gridley! - This one's gone.
Excuse me, sir. - What are you doing? What are you doing!
We still might save him.
I've got a beat.
I, uh... I'll arrange for yourtransportation to Marseilles.
Oh, no, that won't be necessary, sir. I have my own jet.
Yourattention, please. PagingMrDerek Flint.
Yourplane is ready, sir.
You said nine o'clock, Mr Flint.
Yes.
Thank you.
Mmm. Yes.
Check, please.
Finest bouillabaisse in
Marseilles, monsieur.
Merci, monsieur.
The shipment went as scheduled.
I had some free time, and only here do theyreally make bouillabaisse. I thought...
You thought? It is your musclethat thinks, not your brain.
And this in plain sight of everyone.
A harmless jar of cream. A little gift for one's wife.
A harmless jar of cream? Someone in thisden ofthieves stole it and examined it.
Well, I thought...- You will leave at once.
Look slowly to your right.
Yeah! More! Come on, baby, come on.
Come on, let's see you work hard.
Come on, baby!
Hello, Flint. - 0008.
I wanted a word with you.
- Yeah, my pleasure.
Narcotics. A new, powerful drug. Hear anything?
No. SPECTRE involved? -
It's bigger than SPECTRE.
Who is it?
GALAXY.
GALAXY? ls that all? - That's it.
So long, 0008. - So long, Flint.
Hans Gruber, Hitler Youth Movement, escaped during the Nuremberg trials.
I'm a much nicer person now.
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
Appenine-Tuscan kaolin.
Water from the Pontine Marshes.
Cold cream.
Rome? Why the hell is he going to
Rome? - I don't exactly know, sir.
'To buy ajar of cold cream.'
Cold cream. Cold cream, eh?
The world is crumblingand he's buying cold cream.
Yourreport? - Mr Flint will cause no more trouble.
An interesting statement, butnotfactual.
The explosion. I heard it myself.
The explosion was live, and unfortunatelyso is Mr Flint.
Thanks to Rodney's desire forproof, we discovered there were no remains.
Why didn't you tell me? - That you were unsuccessful again?
Rodney, you mustlearn patience.
Gentlemen, forgive me. You are scientists.
As such, you are accustomed to failure.
It merely increases your desire for success.
But in my business, failure is inexcusable.
We've treated Flint too lightly.
He's too dangerous to live.
Yes. We've lostseveralgoodmen, anda valuedfriendin Gruber.
Gentlemen, I'd welcome the opportunity...-
We have notyetlost confidence in Gila.
Mr Flint will cause no more trouble. I...
...havejust received the information I requested.
You mean the impregnable Mr
Flintdoes have one weakness?
No, Dr Schneider. Four.
Madam? - Yes, would you unzipper me, please?
Thank you.
'Am walking into... trap.'
'Heading for the Exotica Beauty Factory.'
'If lucky, will lead to laboratory.'
'If not, please send flowers.'
I'm leaving for Rome immediately.
You can contact me at the embassy.
Gila? Our visitorhas arrived.
Good. Now I can silence him permanently. - Put away the gun.
Violence hasn't worked. You have proof...
...ofthat. Besides, how do you know he is alone?
All right, Gila. But you'd better be right this time.
It is my responsibility to deliver Flint.
Buongiorno. Do you have an appointment?
Well, not really, but I would liketo see the manager, if at all possible.
My card.
Please, I couldn't think of accepting this.
Yes?
There's a man here. He's very insistent...- My name is Flint.
I didn't...- Thank you very much, my dear.
You have a very charmingand efficient secretary.
Mr Flint, do you alwaysbarge into people's offices?
No, I'd rather be invited.
Come in.
I've a feeling I was expected. Have we met before?
Twice before, Mr Flint. Once in
New York and once in Marseilles.
Oh, you must have been the blond harpist.
And Gruber's friend.
And you left me a little present. Ajar like this, right?
May I look inside? - Some ofthem are harmless, Mr Flint.
You were right. We were expecting you.
Well, here I am. Now, shall wetalk about the weather?
About what? - The weather.
Of course. But not here.
Personal matters require privacy.
Oh, you have some little place in mind? A... a trap?
You are prepared to take some risks, no?
I'll answer all your questions. Is that a deal?
It's cold cream. - Cold cream.
Yes, it's a deal.
How romantic. Rome at night.
A sky full of stars.
It is marvellous, isn't it?
You can almost see a whole galaxy from here.
Shall we discuss it further?
I thought we were gonnatalk about the weather.
You won't believe me. You're too shrewd, tooexperienced to pay attention to our secret.
You try me.
They are controlling the weatherfrom inside a volcano.
Right. Inside a volcano.
Where? Where is this volcano?
Not so fast, Mr Flint.
There are many other details.
Get some brandy.
Now, tell me more about that volcano.
He took the key. He's on his way.
You say you speak English? - Yes, sir.
This man you described, you took him to this address?
Yes. He was the one who was sitting therefiguring out the lottery numbers.
Mm? Oh. Yeah.
There's the building...
What's the trouble? - There's no building.
Will someone tell this idiot to make sense? - All right, now what happened?
Do you think he...? - General,
I didn't have anything to drink.
Now, just a minute. Nobody's accusing you of anything.
We both know there was a building there.
And buildings can't disappear into thin air.
So what happened to the building?
- It disappeared into thin air.
Great intelligence work. Your next post will be Peyton Place!
You talk about discipline.
Why did you stop me from killing Flint?
- Are you questioning my loyalty?
No, no.
I merely thought you might have felt...
...certain stirrings.
You are romantic yourself, Rodney.
There's verylittle air in thatsafe.
Flint will die of suffocation.
Your way wouldhave been kinder. - Myapologies, Gila.
How very thoughtfulyou are.
'Have discovered locationof enemy headquarters.'
'Advise you send fleet thereat once and destroy it.'
Congratulations on the capture ofFlint.
You have done well, Section Four.
You willbe pleased to knowFlint's fourplaymates have arrivedatheadquarters, andare nowin the proc essofbeingprogrammed.
Get him back! We gotta find that location! - Yes, sir.
That's it. That's... What's the message?
'Will give you location later.'
'Am headed for...
...a family reunion. Regards, Flint.'
A... family reunion?
Well, you were right. He's dead.
You will arrange for the coffin.
- I've already arranged it.
It's on its way. - You were very sure.
Yes. Weren't you?
Send it.
This photograph arrived minutes ago.
It speaks for itself.
He was the best.
Undisciplined, but the best.
He was a legend.
Yes, sir? At once.
Gentlemen, your attention, please. The television screen.
I don't know, sir. It's on all channels.
Who are they?
People ofthe world, there is no need to panic.
Please do notbe alarmed.
We are yourfriends.

Gila, we're approaching the island. Do you want to go on deck?
Oh, no. Why force themto turn offthe waterfall?
What nonsense. As iftherecould be a man like that.
I believe your friend in the box therewas brought up on stuff like that.
Poor heroic Mr Flint.
Report, please. - Section Four reporting. Mission successful.
You have proof?. Afterall, you havemade quite a few unsuccessfulattempts.
That's true, Dr Wu, but...-
Valuable time has been wasted.
Several colleagues have been lost, and all through sheer negligence.
Had I been in charge, Dr
Wu, things wouldhave...
...been different. Flint was only a man.
Mr Flint was no ordinary man!
We have his body with us. - How unfortunate there was no other way.
Report to headquarters. And congratulationson the elimination ofFlint.
No! Help!
Absolutely no one is getting through, sir.
Gentlemen, I give you Mr Flint.
Come on.
Say, why does that eagle attack me?
He's been trained to recogniseand attack Americans.
An anti-American eagle.
It's diabolical.
Come on. We can't keep 'em waiting.
Mr Flint,
I am Dr Krupov.
Doctor.
I am very happy to meet you in person.
Thank you, sir. - And this is Dr Wu and Dr Schneider.
How do you do? - Dr Schneider.
Dr Wu.
Gentlemen... I have not hadthe pleasure of meeting Mr Flint.
I am Malcolm Rodney.
Oh, yes.
How very smart you lookin your
GALAXY uniform, Mr Flint.
Don't you think so, Gila?
We found this in his pocket, sir.
The Americans' fondnessfor marvellous toys!
A weapon too, perhaps?
You are obviously anextraordinary fellow, Mr Flint.
That you have come this faris a great tribute, Mr Flint.
Well, thank you. - I would say it's more of a tribute to Gila.
To Gila? - Yes.
Or rather to her individuality.
She has allowed self-interestto supersede her loyalty to GALAXY.
If Rodney had shown me more loyalty...- I carried out your orders.
We were unsuccessful three times.
I could have disposed of Flint!
- Gila, Rodney is right.
As head of Section Four, you wereresponsible for every mission.
But I have given my life to GALAXY.
Gentlemen, it seems to me...
...that what it comes to is this: ln a moment of extreme decision, our dear Gila made an instinctive choice.
But that choice was not for GALAXY.
Her conditioning is incomplete. It is our mistake.
We made a sentimental misjudgment.
True, Dr Schneider. True. You understand,
Gila. Now, you will be taken to the...
No. It's not fair.
Gila, GALAXY may be served in many ways.
As a woman, there is one wayin which you may best serve GALAXY.
Gila! Gila!
Take her to Preparation.
Take her to Preparation.
How often woman's animal nature triumphs!
Perhaps now, Dr Wu, you'll admit that I was correct.
Strength has its merits, Rodney, but I value intelligence higher.
Gentlemen, Mr Flint's seemingly limitlesstalents can be of value to GALAXY.
Of course. - Yes.
I think Mr Flint has outlived his usefulness.
- We will be the judge ofthat, Mr Rodney.
Mr Flint, we welcome you to GALAXY.
To GALAXY!
Gentlemen,
I thank you very much for your kind offer, but you must know that
I came to GALAXY...
...not to join the organisation, but to destroy it.
You see, gentlemen?
He's not worth saving.
When something is deadly, you kill it!
- It is a new world we offer, Mr Flint.
Gentlemen, your priceis much too high for me.
You are wrong, Mr Flint.
Hear us, Mr Flint.
We seek no master race. We are the friends ofthe common man.
Surely you must have noticedthe absence of guns here in our paradise.
Violence is a last resort.
It was only the unenlightened resistance ofa...
...decadent world that triggered our actions.
Under our guidance you willbecome a useful scientist.
Take him to Preparation.
Wait!
Gentlemen, I'm sorry.
But all my instincts tell me that
Mr Flint's archaic sense of independence...
...mayeventually re-emerge, with disruptive results.
Dr Krupov is right.
Flint will never conform.
It may be best to return him to his elements.
The electro-fragmentiser.
I wonder what it is that always makesthe Rodneys choose the wrong side.
Enjoy your defiance.
It'll be the last pleasureyou have on this earth.
You're a foolish man, Mr Flint.
Gentlemen, the temperature in the Arcticis still rising, and so is the water level.
Sir? It's unanimous.
Capitulation.
The fleet is in readiness?
Yes, sir.
Request permission to joinAdmiral
Davenport in my old unit.
Thank you, sir. I'll leave at once.
Thank you, sir.
Repeat: Mysole purpose in lifeis to bringpleasure to my companions.
My sole purpose in life is to bringpleasure to my companions.
All thatis asked ofme I willperform.
All that is asked of me I will perform.

It is an honour to offer my bodyto the service of GALAXY.
Repeat after me: I am not a pleasure unit.
I am not a pleasure unit.
I am not a pleasure unit.
I am not a pleasure unit.
We have to get up to thatcommunications room. My lighter...
Our lighter has been fragmentised.
They are expecting me in the reward room. - Reward room? What's that?
Never mind. You'll love it.
Brand me.
What?
It's our only chance.
Go ahead.
Present the unit, please.
- Pleasure Unit 504.
Present the unit, please.
Pleasure Unit 736.
Unit 736 is welcome here.
Enter, 736, andgo to the firstrobing room.
It's me, Anna. You're not a pleasure unit.
You're not a pleasure unit.
You're not a pleasure unit.
Now listen, girls. You stay right herewith
Gila. I'll be back for you all shortly.
Where are you going?
I'm going to put GALAXY into orbit.
Ladies andgentlemen, the president ofthe United States.
My fellowAmericans, whatlhaveto say does not come easily.
Butl cannotshirk myresponsibility, nor can lkeep from you the gravityofthe crisis we are nowfacing.
Itis with a heavyheart thatlmakethe following announcement:
People ofallnations, all ofyou knowsomething ofthe events ofthe pastfew weeks...
Flint?! - It can't be!
Of course it can. That's why he's Flint.
Purple alert!
We have allbeen witness...-
Purple alert. Purple alert.
All units, air and naval. The mountain island, latitude 18 degrees 9 minutes north,
Iongitude 11 degrees 3 minutes west. Destroy! Destroy!
Commander, the bridge.
Are you there, sir? Sir, stall!
Stall, dammit! Flint is alive!
Uh, no, uh...
No great decision...- 54, 22, 37.
Does anyone know this code? - No.
No. - Well, it must have some meaning.
Communications room, Dr Wu speaking. Come in, please.
Communications room? Dr
Krupov. Come in, please.
Come in, please. Dr Schneider calling.
- Rodney, check communications room.
Communications room? Dr
Schneiderspeaking. Come in.
Communications room, come in...
Attention. Attention.
Flinthas escaped. Findhim.
Findhim.
There he is! Get him!
Get back! The wheel! - The steam!
Somebody kill the steam!
I'll get it...
Get Flint!
Up there!
Don't, Mr Flint! You will destroy the...
...potentialof all of mankind, organised for good.
Not for my good, Dr Wu. - Mr Flint!
It would mean an end for all time topoverty, disease, doubt and frustration!
Mr Flint, we have the power to doaway with excessive heat and cold!
To turn wastelands into Gardens of Eden! -
All I have to do is take a bite ofyour apple?
No, thanks. - No, Mr Flint!
Mr Flint! No!
Ours would be a perfect world! Why?
Because it's your idea ofperfection, gentlemen, not mine.
It is better to surrender than todestroy this great work. Agreed?
Yes! - Agreed!
All right, Mr Flint. The power is yours. Take it.
Please, take it, Mr Flint. There has been too much violence.
It is senseless to take more lives. - It is not senseless to take one more life!
Hey! Come on!
You people out there, pay attention!
Lower a boat. - Aye aye, sir.
Blankets.
Bring them up to the bridge.
Sir?
Yes, sir?
Yeah! Over a waterfall, sir. Yes, in steel drums.
Yeah, that's right. In drums!
D-r-u-m-s.
Yes. Oh, he wrecked the whole island!
He had no drum, he dove offthe topofthe island. Gotta be a world record!
No, sir, I don't know his political affiliation.
He is young enough to be a senator, yes, sir.
I believe he's aboard, sir. Wouldyou like to speak with him? Yeah.
Flint? Flint, our commander in chiefwould like to...
The commander in chiefwould liketo congratulate you and your friend.
Flint!
I'm sorry, he's indisposed at the moment, sir.
What?
I can't hear ya!
"The chastity of a woman is a sty in the eye of the Devil."
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Alas, I have a message from Hell.
Hell is horn-shaped.
At the bottom are sinners whose sorrows are ending.
Then other hells, and close to the ground, ours, imagined by the strong heads of Christianity.
This inverted ministry is run by a Satan who has become increasingly powerful through the ages, eternally rejuvenated, evolving, and increasingly human. even spiritualized.
Our play starts here.
Satan has something wrong with his eye - perhaps a sty which must have come from a draught of air
- unbelievable in Hell - or from some drama that has taken place on Earth.
This is why he has called his advisers
Count Armand de Rochefoucault and Marquis Giuseppe de Maccopazza.
Let us mention that the Count was a politician and a famous poisoner, a great lover of plainsong whereas the perversions of the Marquis made the wings of the archangels quiver with delight unto the very depths of Hell.
If the problem were not so serious,
I would find it stimulating.
Let us then go to the root of the evil, to the sty of the Master.
Absolutely, my dear Marquis.
You mean...?
The chastity of a young woman.
What a challenge to Hell!
20 years old. As beautiful as a rose.
And intelligent too.
Perfect health and teeth. Engaged to be married. and still a virgin.
Yes, still.
Unbearable situation.
If she marries as she is, the consequences will be disastrous.
Heaven will exalt, the archangels will sound their trumpets and will make an infernal din.
This must be avoided!
I stress the danger of setting a precedent.
What would happen if others started to follow her example?
The result? Order and submission,
- monogamy, happy marriage.
- let us not exaggerate
Mrriage will remain the solid basis of Hell, our masterpiece.
Exactly. What would Hell be without marriage?
Dear Sirs, I an sick.
Something must be done.
Certainly, Master.
Something must be done.
Yes, something must be done.
Satan has his moments of genius.
Admit it!
When innocence reigns, evil is not far away.
We do not lack weapons to fire at this young heart.
Francesco da Pisa, who raped two thousand nuns, the Count Zum Felsenstein whose virility doubled the Silesian population.
And all this is nothing for the artist, the fanatic, the dreamer... the great
Don Juan.
Greetings, Lord.
Are you well?
Yes, since you have given me back my sleep.
And your dreams?
I endure them.
- Apart from that, you are content?
- Yes.
Except that I feel a little fragile, as if my insides have been burned and my skin covered nothing.
There is still much time.
Yes, Lord, I know.
And your punishment?
I find it tedious, almost unworthy of me.
Painful like a toothache, but not intolerable.
Please excuse me.
Of course.
Pablo!
Yes
Do you have a cold?
It is the smoke, Master.
Give me the powder and my purple dressing gown.
- The first sorrow of the day awaits.
- You recognized her?
Not, but you will recognize her by taking off her skirts.
You have been telling me that every day for
300 years. And you cannot change.
Because nothing must change.
I forgive you.
Let the beautiful one enter. I am ready.
Was she crying?
Cried? Devil, yes!
Women are bathed in tears.
Their tears stream everywhere.
A man could drown in all this salt water.
But it is curious in this dry air.
Hell has its whims.
The tears of a woman can weigh more than lead.
I kitted you out like an old trollop.
So you will enjoy your sorrow in beauty.
You were not waiting for me so early...
Your servant, sir.
Surprising not to find you in the arms of some girl.
I assure you...
Your servant had to make her leave by a secret door.
Darling! How can you...?
I come to kill you.
You are brave and you play a tight hand.
You spare me a delicious frisson.
My chest will open to your dagger as your thighs opened to the dart of my love.
Give us this ultimate ecstasy, the only one that our bodies did not taste.
I offer my death to you as I offered you my life.
Consume this sacrifice to purify our love for ever.
My vision is troubled, Don Juan.
Silver flames from your mouth burn me. Your arm...
My treasure, come and rest for a moment.
Drink this wine to recover your hatred.
That I may help you to release your breasts.
Let kiss your neck.
Keep your dagger and your hatred, my love.
Oh, I am burning, Don Juan!
I want to calm you, to release you from your clothes.
I love you, Don Juan.
The play is finished.
The play is finished.
The next woman will arrive and the scene will be repeated.
The same scene, the same ending.
The old demon is coming to sound the end of the play.
I have a proposal to make to you.
You can accept or refuse.
Only Hell practices free will.
I am listening.
Look at this portrait.
I propose that you go up to Earth and corrupt this girl from her virginity, her purity and her faith in love.
What will the celestial powers say?
The angels are so naive when it is a question of girls.
You should know.
Earth, Don Juan.
One evening, one night and one morning.
All the power of Hell will be with you.
What does the virtue of a young woman weigh?
I reduce your punishment by 300 years, Don Juan, and give you a serene sleep without the knowledge of Heaven.
A sleep without dreams.
Will Pablo accompany me?
Yes.
Do you want to see the Earth again?
What a question, Master!
The terrestrial paradise is my paradise.
I will enjoy it like a fool.
We will be alive.
Exactly!
I will suck out life, benefit from life, wallow in life.
Then it will be done.
My eye is already better.
The Marquis and I studied various methods of seduction applicable to this Scandinavian country. ll appears that a sudden attack is preferable to a prolonged siege.
The seducer will use tenderness and the firmest resolution not leaving any doubt to the object.
That is understood.
A Mediterranean liveliness in his tone, purity and moderation in order to inspire confidence.
We have adopted an elegiac tone, a mere nothing of sorrow overcome in order to exalt the imagination and sympathy.
In this, we are experts.
Any declaration suggesting coldness or perversion is strictly prohibited.
For what do they take us?
A bit of cynicism stemming from wounded idealism is authorized - even recommended.
The young Scandinavian woman is receptive to a refined speech tinted by a foreign accent.
A virile attitude is an advantage, although not essential.
She is not used to compliments and one must praise her charms and her clothes, but with prudence.
If the seducer is too enthusiastic, she will think that he lies and the game is lost.
Summary:
The Scandinavian woman is impassioned, surprising, independent loyal and romantic, but absolute in her passion.
She often gets cold feet.
To take her immodesty for frivolity would be to underestimate her.
Inexperienced, but curious.
Easier to access in summer when she has less clothes.
She is seldom aware of her femininity thus she is easy to capture.
Her morality is impenetrable, she is thus difficult to keep.
Some think that God has died or does not exist, empty sky and inaccessible eternity.
They say that evil is one of the implacable laws of nature, that good is a perversion inexplicable by man.
This is certainly the basis of a tragedy.
But this is a comedy, so your host must act differently.
Hell is underground,
God and his angels populate the seven skies and in the middle, Earth in all its splendour.
Don Juan and Pablo emerge in the autumn sun at one of these dried up wells which go down into the infernal labyrinths by secret elevators.
Blind and staggering, they contemplate the terrestrial paradise.
Trees! Flowers!
Clouds!
More trees! Grass!
Water! Birds!
Look at the grass, the flowers!
What am I doing? I’m taking care of your safety, my lambs.
In agreement with Satan?
Completely.
I am one of the oldest and more malicious demons of Hell.
To such a degree that the Master often says:
“I have finally had enough of you.''
But he says it in a friendly way.
Now what did I want to say? Ah yes!
I must take care that these gentlemen fulfill their mission.
Indeed,
Satan particularly insisted on the fact...
Satan especially charged me to keep an eye on Pablo.
“No jokes with the women'' he said.
My sense of humour too is limited.
I will be able to find a way to deceive you.
Always try.
Here is what men call so lightly “the game of chance”.
Pasteur arrives in his car.
I disappear to create the breakdown.
I have always said it: the Lord helps his own!
My first breakdown and two angels appear as if they have come from on high!
My life is a series happy misfortunes.
It is as if the Devil and his minions retracted their tails when I arrive.
You are unmarried, Pasteur?
On the contrary.
My wife is intelligent and beautiful.
I have less sense, but I have a good heart and I am easy to deceive.
I imagine that all that balances out.
Do you have any dau... children?
Only a girl.
She is the apple of my eye.
A rose of Saron.
She is of an age to marry.
A nice guy, graduate agronomist.
He is taking the fields to farm.
So the young couple will become our neighbors.
Thanks be to God.
You will dine with me at the presbytery?
We cannot decline.
You are heartily welcome, sirs.
My dear, I have guests.
Renata is not very well.
Her health is poor but she wants to see you.
Here are my friends and benefactors.
They will stay to dine.
It will be a pleasant evening.
We are not disturbing you?
On the contrary, I was dying of boredom.
You see, my husband cannot stand the sadness of our life.
My wife writes poems.
A pastime.
I hope we will be able to hear some.
There is no question of that!
We must spare ones hosts.
I must show you my daughter.
You will like her.
I am convinced of it.
We will return soon.
Love
One of my predecessors, of whom this is a portrait, who was very original and extremely versed in all matters accepted one evening the offers of service of a evil as ordinary compensation.
And what did Pasteur do?
He pulled the unsavoury individual into this cupboard and closed the door.
The doors turned reddish brown on the inside.
And what do you have there?
My wife doesn’t like me to have a glass...
Do you know why I say that?
I would also like to lock up a devil.
I would make it speak.
Forgive me, Renata.
But it is good and cleans me out.
Let us go and see Britt-Marie.
Get out of my bed or I will call my husband.
Please, think of my reputation!
The scandal!
The servants!
I will not leave my bed simply because a lout has taken possession of it.
Why do you blow at my neck?
Your neck is one of the most delicious I have seen and I draw aside the hair from it to admire it.
I am dazzled by the striking beauty of your hair.
Your nose is particularly large and ugly, whatever that means.
And your mouth is special, whatever that means.
Moreover, your smell drives me insane.
Wait before doing anything.
Resist a little, to increase our pleasure.
Do not say anything, I know all.
I read it in your eyes.
Your wisdom, your character, your femininity, your fragile health all, absolutely all forbids you to yield to passion.
Really?
But in your heart, hides a weak point, Renata.
A flood of sensuality restrained too long.
Your dreams alone leave it free course.
- You think so?
- Resist still a little.
Where was I?
- In my dreams.
- Ah yes.
In your dreams, you taste a pleasure without equal, at the limit of shame.
How do you know?
One picks these things up over the years.
And you are a great example.
But only the inspiration counts.
I am inspired, I will not keep it up.
You are tired.
Yes, my legs are on fire and my stomach does not feel right.
Come in, come in!
Greetings.
I bet Jonas that everything would be painted by tomorrow.
He does not believe it.
They did all the decoration themselves.
Welcome to my house.
Enchanted.
A true hostess!
You are its first host.
A good sign.
I break down, and as if ascended from the very bowels of the earth...
Father! The usher has been waiting for you since 3 o’clock!
My God, you have made me forget!
I must hurry.
Stay well, dear friends!
Jonas wants to put the dining room there.
Myself, I would like to see it as the children’s room. Come and see.
It faces full south, ideal for the children.
But he wants his dining room.
Who will win?
He will, until the little ones arrive.
Will there be many?
Jonas wants at least four of them but twelve do not frighten me.
Do you have any?
- Why do you smile?
- Because you are watching me.
I was comparing you to Jonas.
Favourably?
Naturally.
May I see the kitchen?
It is almost finished.
Not bad, eh?
That comes from my grandmother.
The old clock too comes from her.
And on the floor we have put tiles - very easy to maintain.
And these wall cupboards!
Jonas did all the carpentry.
Bravo Jonas!
Yes, he is only twenty-five years old, but he is calm and masculine, almost like a father.
- ll must be marvellous.
- Yes, it is.
And intelligent. He calculates everything with a slide rule.
And if he forgets it?
He never forgets anything.
- And you love him!
- Yes.
We were promised in marriage when I was 13. He was 18.
And you marry him.
It is so comforting to have a strong man at one’s side.
Never an argument?
Sometimes, I am annoyed.
Then he explains my reactions and calms me down.
He knows human nature.
He has no faults?
He eats noisily and does not wash his feet.
Those are not really faults.
I congratulate you.
Thank you. I am so proud of him.
You will be happy.
Absolutely.
Let us see the bedroom.
No, not that.
Do as I say.
Close your eyes.
Describe me.
Blue eyes, fair hair, pretty nose, a mouth for kisses, high breasts, rounded hips.
As if made for love...
Silence!
You are wounded?
We hardly know each other and you speak to me already about love.
Doesn't Jonas speak about it?
You pose too many questions.
Oh, forgive me.
I forgive you.
He is the only one that you have embraced?
Of course not. What do you imagine?
May I kiss you?
Of course.
The real Don Juan.
Quite so.
It was very innocent.
It’s my turn to kiss you.
You are the thirty-seventh.
The thirty-seventh?
I want to reach fifty before my marriage.
You know the women?
A little.
Of course you know them.
And I, who do not know anything,
I make you tremble.
I know one thing.
What is that?
I love Jonas.
Nothing will stop this love.
- And all others?
- It was a joke.
You kissed me.
I wanted to know.
I wanted to kiss you to see.
And then?
I felt without stopping your voice, your way of looking at me, then the kiss.
That does not change anything.
Nothing?
I love Jonas.
I love his kisses, his gestures, his way of holding me.
You like to play with fire.
Life would be quite sad if one never lied.
And people believe you!
Me, for example.
Yes, for example. But perhaps this is bad to play like that.
Jonas reproaches me for it.
He finds it cruel.
But it is too tempting.
Men want others to lie to them.
They promise to believe all that people say to them.
Does nothing touch you?
“Touch me”?
I never lie to Jonas.
Naturally, Jonas would see clearly.
You are being ironic about Jonas.
And you enjoy it.
You live according to principles which are the most sacred of life.
Coarse and stupid.
No, I understand you.
- I do not believe in them.
- It is true.
My principles are not to have any.
Vice is my virtue, debauchery my asceticism, impiety my religion.
Basically, we are like each other.
You are afraid?
Yes, but not of you.
Then of yourself.
I know one thing.
You are not an ordinary man and you can wound me with death.
It is my dearest desire.
Strange.
What?
At the bottom of my heart,
I want this wound.
But one should not.
You must think of your little Jonas.
I must safeguard my love.
Which is only of words.
Self-conceit of a young woman.
Your vanity, your air of any knowledge drape themselves in a show of love. ll is necessary to love in order to know love.
You speak like a believer.
But God only exists for believers.
You neither believe nor know anything.
Do not be so sure.
I am perhaps incapable of love but I have seen it at close quarters.
It is a rare gift?
Yes, a rare gift.
Few are capable of love. and they suffer infinitely.
You believe that they are close to God, and that they illumine with His light those who wander in darkness.
It is possible that you are right. I don’t know.
I have chosen another road: contempt and indifference.
I do not understand.
Not, you do not understand.
You do not hope for anything?
I do not hope for anything.
You do not dream?
Not, I do not dream.
Then you are dead.
It is true.
What do you want of me?
To hurt me?
To poison me?
To kill me?
Jonas only had to come tomorrow.
This is the end of the first act.
They was the first movements of this rather frivolous quadrille.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I forgot one thing.
As you suspect,
Hell governs time.
Satan has just unleashed a storm.
Pasteur requests his hosts remain for the night.
They accept, for obvious reasons.
What else do I have to say to you?
The black cat is part of the circle and feasts in the kitchen.
Thus Pasteur nurses three vipers.
The autumn is early.
In the south, where I come from, the autumnal storms are announced by an immense crimson cloud which sits on the horizon for seven nights.
People said that it was a goatskin full of divine tears poured over our sins.
The seventh night, when the cloud bursts the rain is one of salt and bitterness.
All the bells ring out.
How very interesting!
Let us see if God cries on us from above.
Do not be foolish.
Can I have the cream?
Ah yes, the pigs will arrive.
They will have to marry quickly.
Jonas, we could...
I have an exciting way.
Not now.
The rate of births will be enormous. That will make...
Change this rule.
- Why?
- It is not funny.
It is you who are not funny.
Thank you.
You telephone me.
To tell me to come immediately with a funny voice.
Then I got cut off.
- Someone played a joke on you.
- The joke of a cretin!
Have the children finished arguing?
Jonas is acting boorishly.
You want to leave the table, do you?
Thank you for Your gifts. Amen.
You are ridiculous.
It is rather you who are ridiculous.
- I will forgive if you forgive.
- What generosity!
I am annoyed.
Then be annoyed.
You are badly raised and insolent, insolent and badly brought up, without good manners, you are... badly brought up.
And you, you are...
Go on, say it!
Selfish and spoiled.
Do not restrict yourself.
You are selfish and spoiled.
Why argue?
I am going.
Stay.
Not, he will get us out of other horrors yet.
Go ahead, say it to me!
You did not kiss me when I arrived.
Did that annoy you?
It wounded me.
Is that better?
Not at all.
Then leave!
It was one autumn evening, the moon was full and the air cold.
Don Juan, escaping, climbed a wall and found himself in a cemetery.
He then saw rising the statue of the governor - a distinguished man that he had killed in a duel.
Our guest is writing a biography of Don Juan.
Thus...
Seeing this white colossus under the moon, he was taken over by an irresistible feeling of gaiety.
He invited it to dinner.
To his astonishment, the statue bowed to him.
As if accepting.
That evening, Don Juan dined alone.
Pablo served at table.
Suddenly, someone knocked at the door.
The noise resounded throughout the house.
Don Juan told Pablo to open it.
The statue started to speak:
Do you regret your life?
Don Juan shouted '”no'' at his stone guest.
Its terrible fist sent out a stream of fire and ice and Don Juan felt his flesh melt.
He clutched at the inhuman foot which was crushing him.
Then he was pressed right through the ground, down to the bottom of Hell.
Very, very interesting.
But why this history?
Because we have spoken of our experiences.
Experiences! That does not mean anything to me.
My day is filled with experiences, small and large, beautiful and ugly. Sometimes too many for me.
Renata, my little one, be calm.
Leave me alone!
Calm yourself.
You do not understand.
It is ridiculous.
Can't I help you?
Not, nobody can.
All this is too idiotic.
Thank you for today, dear God.
And one more thing….
Help me to understand my wife.
She suffers and I don’t know what to do.
Yet another thing...
Dear God, open my eyes.
Show me the hidden sufferings of men.
Take away my frankness and give me another view, clear but charitable.
Thank you. Amen.
I frightened you? You were sleeping?
I do not believe you. You are sick?
Not especially.
What do you have?
I come only for...
For what?
Nothing.
To look at you.
Sit down on the bed.
- Thank you.
- Tell me.
You would be sad if I died?
Where do these ideas come from?
Answer me.
My sorrow would be terrible.
Why?
Strange question… I love you.
I am just a weight for you and Britt-Marie.
That is not true.
We have all our defects.
You do not understand me.
No?
I would like to understand you so much, to really understand you.
It is a comedy.
Each of you sees me in a different role.
Nobody sees the truth.
We must be honest.
You are so right, Pasteur.
Honesty.
- Did I say something wrong?
- No, not at all.
Good night, my friend.
Sleep on your big ear.
Wake up in your beautiful world, with your good people and with your experiences.
Goodnight.
And if I were unfaithful?
Unfaithful.
What?
If I slept with another.
What an idea!
What would you do?
What would I do?
I would... I don’t know.
You would drive me out?
What an absurd question!
You would still love me?
I must love you no matter what happens.
Love will not cease for such a thing. lt still exists.
You know that I would like to shout?
No, I didn’t know.
Goodnight, my husband.
Forgive me if I frightened you.
I will not start again so quickly.
If something touched your heart,
I could sympathize.
That would be good.
I don’t know.
I will think about it.
Good night, Renata.
God bless you.
How did you get in?
By the door.
Before you closed it.
And I hid there.
And now, I show myself.
Here I am.
Leave!
Our time has come.
We have waited long enough.
Like all men, you chatter, but after...
I am an impassioned man.
Be quiet and leave.
I am a great big ridiculous ninny, but do not wake me up.
Leave me in peace.
I have had enough of it, enough.
You do not want to sleep with me?
Not, I do not.
Three hundred years in Hell,
I languished for love.
For 300 years,
I remained the same man but I had to endure the torment of continence because I died in the arms of my nurse.
For 300 years I kept everything inside me, Renata.
You don’t see that every day.
Do not judge me according to my clothes.
You come from Hell!
You want me to believe you?
Yes!
Heaven or Hell, what does it matter?
You do not risk anything.
You can live unforgettable moments.
Unforgettable.
It will be a dream.
Yes, a dream.
But it will not be a dream with me.
- Let us pretend!
- I am too old.
Fake it.
That is all that I do.
You see me in Hell?
Naked, thin, senile and gray, breathing dust.
Day after day, always the same sad tasks. lmagine me...
I am not one of these great swindlers, only one who is half-damned, without joy or hope.
If I get to Heaven, it will be also sad.
Then I was granted one day and one night on Earth and I meet you!
You are the masterpiece most beautiful, most marvellous, softest, finest, most extraordinary that Pablo ever knew.
Oh, I know that I annoy you.
No.
You are amusing enough.
I do not have anything any more to say.
I turn over to my daily grind.
Think of poor Pablo.
I also had a mother who cried over my sins.
At least she was tender with me.
Come here.
You do not have shame to awaken the mother in me?
No.
You succeeded in touching my heart.
That is good.
And in giving me an experience.
Thank you.
You are entitled to a reward.
Thank you.
You may kiss me.
It is forbidden! Do not forget!
- You do not obey?
- As you see.
A pity for you. And for her.
- What is the matter?
- I am a demon.
A devil from Hell. Do you understand?
Very, very interesting.
But I am dreaming.
Heavens no, I am awake!
What do you want?
Troubles, Pasteur.
I am not one of these merry devils who haggle over hearts.
I am a spoilsport.
I am honoured nevertheless that this has happened to me!
- Thank you, Lord!
- Enough of that!
Even a devil has right to a little respect!
Forgive me. I was not paying attention.
What do you have in your heart?
I have no heart.
Your wife is going to bed with one of your nice guests.
What do you say?
Are you deaf?
Your wife is sleeping with another man.
Is it clear?
You want to say that Renata
Is getting ready to...
Dear little devil, you should find something else.
I do not require that you believe me.
I want you to get up and go to the door of Renata’s room.
It is closed.
Here’s the key.
Go ahead!
- And if I refuse?
- You will be alright.
Nothing is more attracting than evil.
You are a true devil.
I flatter myself for it.
Then you will open it?
And finally, you will know.
You will be able to see clearly, to understand, to see the loathing, the animal desire, to expose your heart to the poisonous bite, to become more human.
You who have feigned your life and believed in human kindness.
Open the door.
Contemplate the stinking flower of adultery.
You and your experiences!
Here is an experience which will tighten your throat.
Shall we have a drink first?
Yes!
Good idea.
Let us fortify ourselves in evil.
I am so nervous I can’t find the bottle.
You are smaller. Help me.
- I can’t see anything.
- On the left. Lower down.
I will get a chair.
That’s it.
- You see it now?
- I have it!
Here it was and you took it...
Then keep it, my brother.
You will need it before you set out again to your place.
I have a devil in my wall cupboard!
How are you?
Your gin goes down nicely.
I am glad.
Thank you. Will you go and see your wife?
That notion would not come into my head.
You are a wet chicken.
Keep talking, brother.
I will benefit from your knowledge.
I will not make use of it to do evil, but good.
Devil!
It is useless to make a scene, to be sad or to shout.
If you are nice, I will request that you go to Heaven.
What spite, coming from a priest!
You flatter me.
Sleep now. We will speak again tomorrow. Goodnight.
Report on the devil in my cupboard.
End of the Second Act.
Here begins the Third.
One moment of patience please.
The author added a description of nature a sort of weather report that I must transmit to you.
The night is black, full moon, complete silence.
Various scents - of the dew,
There is still a full moon, etc.
Let us jump all that and come straight to the facts.
Do to me what you will.
I cannot bear your suffering.
It overpowers me more than anything I know.
Set me free by your suffering.
My suffering!
I do not love you, your body does not disturb me.
You are strange and intimidating, but you do not frighten me any more.
My love for Jonas will remain intact.
You will wound only me, and yourself.
Did you sleep?
I slept and I dreamed.
Do devils dream?
Nightmares, Pasteur, for others.
Do you want me to tell them?
It would be very interesting.
You have a girl, a rose of Saron, a virgin among the ground pots.
Be quiet!
As you wish, Pasteur.
No, tell.
While one of the guests slept with your wife, the other seduced your daughter.
All that is your fault because you asked them to stay the night.
Then, what do you say? lmpossible.
This is what it is like to have a devil in the cupboard.
Too late!
You always arrive too late!
Excuse me.
What is the matter?
I don’t know,
I must have lost my head.
I have a devil in the cupboard.
He dreamed that you...
You sleepwalk?
Not any more.
Before, yes and that disorientates me.
One sees things under another light...
Are you alright?
Yes.
Did you cry?
Goodnight, father.
Goodnight, my little daughter.
I will go and dig the garden and sit on the grass in the rain.
I will feel good, in the open air.
For my breakfast,
I will eat some of these green apples, which grow close to the metal grid.
Then I will set out again for Hell.
But I will be grateful.
Do you understand?
And now, Renata?
He touched my heart.
It was not the hardest heart.
What was it then?
I thought unceasingly of you.
Of me?
I felt pity for you.
And now?
I do not know.
You will stay with me?
Where would I go?
Can we start again?
Not, I don’t think so.
Will we change?
We can try.
Go back in and lie down. It is chilly.
I looked for you everywhere.
Jonas has arrived.
I have to prepare to meet him.
But first I have something to say to you.
I love you.
Yes, I am going away.
Have pity on me.
I beg you.
Please, let me believe that you have a certain feeling for me.
Lie, and I will believe you blindly.
I beg you.
I humiliate myself.
You say that you love me.
But your love is indifferent for me.
I do not understand.
Yesterday, I was a little girl who liked to play.
I was fascinated by your cold violence.
I wanted to be hurt.
I was afraid, but not much.
I thought that my love for Jonas protected me from everything.
Tonight, I understand my mistake.
My love does not protect me from anything.
Your suffering had burned me.
Suddenly, I wanted to hold you against me, to give you everything.
A lie too.
I know it now.
They was dangerous dreams surrounding my desire - a desire of which I was unaware.
Tonight matured me.
The performance is over.
Those on high have deceived us.
Our spite is put to evil work by their icily calculating kindness
I have had enough, I will withdraw.
Heaven will manage without Hell.
It will see whether it is easy.
Our best weapon against a young girl.
And the result is?
The unfeeling one has returned, sick with love!
Curtain, curtain!
It is not finished!
A priest, whom Hell took for a simpleton, changes, wakes up, lock up my best demon in its cupboard!
In short, it becomes a power upon which we may count.
And that is not all.
A woman of a competence that Hell would not disavow opens her eyes on herself and feels pity for her husband.
She will perhaps even become a good wife.
Nor is this all…
As for this dog of Pablo’s, it defies my will and its punishments.
Whoever was it who had the foolish idea to send Don Juan to Earth?
It is true...
It was my own idea.
This trade of mine starts to nauseate me.
It is sad and inelegant to admit the victory of love and the complete defeat of evil.
I am getting old.
Leave me.
Don Juan, keep me company a little longer.
I cannot say that I love you, and surely you have enough love, but without you, my life would have been absurd and I will be faithful for you until the end of damnation.
That is all.
- Don Juan?
- Yes, Lord.
Before, did you suffer from jealousy?
Yes, Lord.
Then allow me a small, mean action.
You, over there, what is your name?
I forgot, monseigneur.
Your hearing is famous.
That is true.
What has happened to our virtuous girl?
That will interest our sentimental friend.
I have heard something… very unpleasant.
... bells…
A horrible noise.
“Will you take as your lawful wedded wife…?”
“Will you take as your lawful wedded husband…?”
- The girl says Yes.
- Continue!
She said it so loud, Sir. The noise hurt me.
What else?
A great festival... No, the young woman is not there.
Where can she be?
Not, not there. Oh, I can hear it!
She is laughing.
A young man is breathing heavily on her.
She tries to speak, but he stifles her with kisses.
And afterwards?
Silence.
I hear a bed, a rustling of clothes...
Perhaps an auditory illusion.
She is breathing strongly, like this...
What can you hear?
She is breathing heavily… then silence.
Complete silence.
Now she is shouting, but not with grief.
I cannot describe this cry.
These gentlemen will perhaps understand.
Oh! she is crying, but not with sorrow.
- Then with happiness?
- I don’t know.
My eye should heal.
But the sty is still there.
Very strange.
Two young people are speaking with each other.
I can hear what they are saying.
'”Do not hold me so tightly”
Then he says: “Why not?”
She says: “I have an abrasion on my lip.”
He says: “But how did you do that?”
He laughs and says:
“someone else kissed you.”
And she says: “How stupid you are!”
I never kissed another man.
I hear that she lies!
By the rotten tooth of my grandmother...
The sty has disappeared!
Hell finally won a victory!
Can I leave?
Of course. Good evening, sirs.
Does that hurt?
If it pleases you, yes.
But I am not complaining.
You are ridiculous with your punishments
You, Satan, and He up there.
And I despise you.
Don Juan will never submit even if you crush him in terror.
I remain Don Juan, scorning both God and Devil.
And I allow myself to spit at your feet.
Good evening, My Lord.
May you and He up there succeed in your cheap trade!
Let Don Juan sleep.
With or without dreams?
With, naturally.
Which kind of dreams?
Terrestrial paradise.
And especially of love.
Isn’t that too cruel, monseigneur?
Nothing is too cruel for those who love.
Ladies and Gentlemen, our play is drawing to a close.
Heaven triumphed, there can be no doubt.
But Hell has gained something too.
As the author of our comedy says:
A small victory for Hell can be worse than a great success for Heaven.
But to help you forget these painful, even suspect truths, here is a final scene of true love in all its splendour.
You will see the young couple plunged in magic from their wedding night.
Very interesting, as Pasteur would say.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you for eternity, amen.
I can kiss you?
Yes, but gently.
On the day I was born
Said me father, said he
''I've an elegant legacy
Waiting for ye
'Tis a rhyme for your lip
And a song for your heart
To sing it whenever
The world falls apart''
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
'Twas a sumptuous gift
To bequeath to a child
For the lure of that song
Keeps me head runnin' wild
'Tis a rhyme for me lip
And a song for me heart
And I sing it whenever
The world falls apart
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
So I bundled me heart
And I roamed the world free
To the East with the light
To the West with the sea
And I searched all the earth
And I scanned all the skies
But I found it at last
In my own true love's eyes
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Eureka!
-Sharon, come quickly.
-What is it now, Father?
We're here. lt's journey's end.
Our destination at last.
Thank heaven. Now l can sit down.
No, you can't sit you down. lt's the hill beyond yon hill. l've been hearing about the hill beyond yon hill ever since we left Ireland.
Keep your distance. Don't crowd around.
Clear the way.
-Step aside.
-What's going on here?
-They're gonna have an auction.
-A what?
They're gonna have it today.
You gonna get this auction started now or ain't you?
Hear ye! Hear ye!
Now, wait a minute!
You can't have an auction without first talking to Susan Mahoney.
-Why not?
-Henry, go get Susan.
Because her brother owns this property, that's why not.
I beg your pardon.
The law states this property belongs to anybody who can pay the back taxes.
-And that's me.
-You mean, Senator Rawkins has it.
-You're just his stooge.
-And Woody don't like stooges.
-Who's Woody?
-He's Susan's brother.
He's nothing but a troublemaking con man.
He is not. Woody's president...
...and general sales manager of the
Rainbow Valley Tobacco Cooperative.
Incorporated.
-What's that?
-Us!
-They're sharecroppers.
-Sure are.
That's how we'll all get rich together.
Woody promised me personally.
-Susan's trying to tell you something.
-I'm listening.
-What she say, Henry?
-She says Woody's coming.
-Woody.
-Woody?
-l didn't hear her say anything.
-Naturally, she was born silent.
One of the few women ever was.
Sure, mister. She don't do ''talk'' talk.
She does foot talk.
Foot talk? That's ridiculous.
-What's she saying now?
-She says you gotta wait for Woody.
He's bringing the money.
Quiet!
-Tax sale gonna start now.
-lt's all right. Woody's coming.
Woody's coming.
Woody's coming. Woody's coming.
Woody's coming.
It's my duty to protect the people of Rainbow Valley.
-Who from?
-From the people of Rainbow Valley.
Hear ye, hear ye.
We can't be bothered with the mortgage man--
This time of the year!
You'll be sorry interfering with the law.
For spring don't care
About the mortgage man
This time of the year
I'm giving you your last chance to get back your land.
The dandelions in the dusky dell
Don't give a hoot in hell
-They're gonna smell without collateral
-This time of the year
-This time
-This time of the year
-Sweet merry buds and elderberry buds
-Don't give a good ding-ding-dang
Corn's shooting up
Fruit trees a-fruitin' up
Go tell Rawkins to go hang-hang
Don't mess around here
This time of the year
You'll get it in the rear
This time of the year
Magnolia's are sentimental
Persimmons are queer
Keep your distance, now.
Give way, there.
You hear me? l said, keep your distance.
Don't easily skeer
They sprout without real-estaters
This time of the year
That choo-choo's comin'
And it's mighty clear
Woo, woo, Woody's here
He's up there ridin' with the engineer
Yes, Woody's here
Just look at that choo-choo puffin'
Let's give it a mighty cheer
Just look at that engine huffin'
Dang blast it all, Woody's here
Woody's here!
Get a load of that whistle blowin'
That whistle is good to hear
It's wantin' you to be knowin'
Dang blast it all, Woody's here
Woody's here!
Woody's here!
And to think l let you whisk me out of lreland...
...across an ocean and down a continent...
...in the sweet, green month of April.
And for what?
For a beautiful new life in a beautiful new land.
-We came here to cure your arthritis.
-Aye, that too. That too.
Well, it's me that's cured of your arthritis. lt's all mythical, and so is that cure place for it called Rainbow Valley.
Now you've gone just a bit too far.
Here l have it on me map, witnessed and endorsed by Rand and McNally. l don't know who Rand is, but l could never trust a McNally.
But you can always trust a McLonergan.
Behold, that mythical land called Rainbow Valley.
Sharon, shake hands with a millionaire.
-A millionaire?
-A multimillionaire.
-Now what's happened to your arthritis?
-That's for the poor. l knew you were up to something. Now, will you stand still and listen to me? l can't. l can't. Oh, no.
Ever since l was 2, you've been seeing leprechauns...
...and rainbows over your whiskey jug.
Now, what pixified fancy of yours has really brought us to America, huh?
You'll love it here. You'll have everything you left behind in Glocca Morra.
You hear that?
What did l tell you? The same skylark music we have back in lreland.
-Aye, a Glocca Morra skylark.
-Aye.
I hear a bird
A Glocca Morra bird
It well may be he's bringin' me
A cheerin' word
I hear a breeze
A River Shannon breeze
It well may be
It's followed me across the seas
Then tell me please
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leapin' there?
Does it still run down to Donny Cove
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that willow tree still weepin' there?
Does that laddie with the twinklin' eye
Come whistlin' by
And does he walk away
Sad and dreamy there
Not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow
And each brook along the way
And each lad that comes a-whistlin'
''Too-ra-lay''
How are things in Glocca Morra...
... these fine days?
Oh, now, Father, why are you crying?
Oh, it's that cheap lrish music.
Where is everybody?
-Hello?
-Hello?
Where are all the children?
What the devil?
He's up there ridin' with the engineer
Yes, Woody's here
Someone's coming. You better get up in that tree and take a look.
Don't easily skeer
They'll sprout without real-estaters
This time of the year lt's only the folk who live here.
America's full of gangsters, you know.
You said it was full of millionaires.
Don't argue.
Can't be bothered
With the mortgage man
This time of the year
Here. Take this.
The spring don't care
About the mortgage men
This time of the year lt's-- lt's gold.
-Aye. lt's a pot of gold.
-And you stole it.
-l never stole it. l borrowed it.
-But...
...who did you borrow it from?
-Why do you want to know?
-So we can lend it back.
-lt's impossible.
-Why not?
Because he's not mortal.
-You killed him.
-Of course not.
He never was mortal. He's a leprechaun.
A leprechaun?
Aye. Who else would have gold in lreland?
They sprout without real-estaters
This time of the year
Now that Woody's here
Now that Woody's here
Now that Woody's here
Now, don't think that this is gonna stop the auction.
You gonna pay them off?
Hey, Howard. You watch me.
Hear ye! Hear ye!
You ain't making a burlesque of the law.
Why not? That's where the law spends most its time.
Seen him in the front row last Monday night, Woody.
-Bet you did.
-Ain't true! Ain't true!
Quiet! This is an unlawful assembly.
Then this unlawful assembly is gonna have to come to order.
All right.
Read it.
Read it.
''Rainbow Valley parcel lot seven...
...is hereby up for auction for default of back taxes...
...in the amount of $ 777.''
-$ 777 going once!
-Yes!
-$ 777 going twice!
-Yes!
-$ 777 going three times!
-Yes!
Sold! To the Rainbow Valley Tobacco
Cooperative lncorporated.
Yeah. That's old Woody.
This covers it, except:
''Service charges, notary services...
...penalty and penal points, convertible debentures...
...miscellaneous and sundry add-on interest.''
Another $ 77.
No, it never said nothing about this in that bill you sent to my sister Susan.
Well, that's how it is with interest.
Don't make a sound.
-Just keeps compounding.
-Ain't you got the balance of the money?
-l figure l'm good for it.
-Cash.
All right, come on, sheriff.
Wait a minute.
Give me a chance to get my money back on this guitar. lt's too late for that.
Money don't grow on trees, you know. lt does for Woody.
Hey, Buzz, say hello to Rawkins!
Rawkins hears about this, we'll both be looking for new jobs.
Come on, sheriff!
Well, now. What do we have here?
-lt's an angel.
-Shame on the frivolous likes of you. lt's an lrish angel.
Your kith and kin pinning their hopes on you...
...and you go squandering your money on a music box. l did it for them. lt's a community guitar.
Aye, and l'm sure that's how you'll use it...
...on every girl in the community.
Daughter, that's no way to be talking to me future business partner.
Partner?
You accepted me money for back taxes, didn't you?
-l intend to pay you back.
-l don't want you to. l just want me property rights.
How much land you think you're entitled to?
An acre or so. All l really need is a parcel of land as big as me bag...
...on the closest point to Fort Knox.
We are in the vicinity of Fort Knox, are we not?
About two miles. ln fact, on a warm night, you can smell the gold.
Have we a deal?
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
-lt's a deal.
-Then give me your hand, son.
-Welcome to Rainbow Valley...
-Hi.
...home of the most prosperous tobacco company...
...in this state.
And l'll wager that.
What's your name?
Sharon McLonergan.
-Mine's Woody Mahoney.
-Mahoney. lt's fate.
How'd you get so pretty...
...and so rich?
You see, back in Glocca Morra where we come from, there's an old legend.
And it says:
You'll never grow old
And you'll never grow poor
If you look to the rainbow
Beyond the next moor
-That's a lovely legend.
-Aye.
-Wonder who thought it up.
-Me father.
Finian McLonergan.
On the day she was born
Said her father, said he
''I've an elegant legacy waiting for ye
'Tis a rhyme for your lip
And a song for your heart
To sing it whenever
The world falls apart
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream''
So I bundled me heart
And I roamed the world free
To the East with the lark
To the West with the sea
And I searched all the earth
And I scanned all the skies
But I found it at last
In my own true love's eyes
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Follow the fellow....
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Bye.
Father?
Now, what would you be doing up at this hour? l'm taking care of you.
Any time the moon is full, a McLonergan will be too.
You go back to bed.
Where are you going with that bag and shovel?
Now, will you leave me be if l tell you?
Aye.
Then let me ask you this.
What do you think makes America different from lreland?
Has more lrishmen. lt has more money.
Everyone in America is rich.
But, Father, are there no poor in America?
No ill-housed and no ill-clad?
Of course. But they're the best ill-housed and the best ill-clad in all the world.
Why? Why, l ask.
And there's no man with wit enough to tell me.
So l'll tell you. Quote me self, quote.
Didn't the Americans rush to dig gold from the ground in California in 1849?
So l've heard.
And didn't they plant it in the soil at Fort Knox later?
-Granted.
-Well, that's it!
You see, there's something about the soil in and around Fort Knox...
...that gives a magical quality to gold.
-Father--
-The gold radiates a powerful influence...
...throughout America. lt activates assembly lines in Detroit...
...it makes skyscrapers sprout from the gutters of New York...
...and it produces a bumper crop of millionaires. And that...
...is the McLonergan theory of economics.
And that's why we came to America?
Aye. To bury me pot of gold.
Now, you go back to bed. lt's a witching night.
Aye. Very scary place. l'll.... l'll.... l'll....
One, two...
...four, five, six, seven, eight.
Green is the color of the shamrock
And the grass on Blarney Hill
Oh, the darlin' green of Ireland
And the good old dollar bill
God be with you.
God and Mary be with ye?
God, Mary and St. Patrick be with ye.
God, Mary, St. Patrick and St. Ozymandias be with ye.
-Ozymandias? l never heard of him.
-He was a special saint.
He's the patron saint of all the leprechauns of Glocca Morra.
-My name is Og.
-Og from Glocca Morra?
-Me native heath.
-Right.
You're an imposter. You can't be a leprechaun, you're too tall! l know, and l'm getting taller! l need your help, Mr. McLonergan.
-Me help?
-Aye.
That calls for a toast. l rise to welcome you to America.
-How are things in Glocca Morra?
-Alas, alack and willy-wally. l weep for Glocca Morra and all lreland.
You weep? Why, what's happened?
A blight has fallen over lreland.
-The British are back.
-Never seen such a curse befall a folk...
...in all me 459 years.
Alas, poor lreland.
-Poor lreland.
-Poor lreland!
-Suffering lreland.
-Suffering lreland!
-The native land!
-Oh, me native land!
A fine lot of fairyfolk you are, letting all this happen.
Why don't you wish it away.
We lost the power.
You mean you've gone and lost the power to make wishes?
-Aye.
-What has lreland to live for now?
-Answer me that.
-Doom and gloom!
Doom and gloom!
-Who's the author of this foul outrage?
-A monster.
-A monster?
-Aye.
You mean the old flame-breathing type, with the head of a dragon?
Oh, no. This is a tiny, wee monster.
He's about...
-...your size.
-Who is he?
Who is this monster?
Excuse me for pointing,
Mr. McLonergan, but it's you.
-Me?
-You brought the blight on yourself...
...when you stole our crock of gold!
The little crock that gives us all the power to wish.
Don't be superstitious, it's bad luck!
-Give it back, Mr. McLonergan.
-How do you know l've got it?
Me magnetic feathers pointed you out all the way from lreland.
Feathers, who's the culprit?
Oh, me arthritis!
Give it back, Mr. McLonergan, before a great evil befalls you.
Can't you postpone your wishing a couple of months?
Gold was never meant for mankind. lt's a fairyland metal that only fairyfolk can use. ln the hands of a mortal, it can only bring...
...doom and gloom.
Doom and gloom!
Doom and gloom.
Stop your wailing, leprechaun. l've come to a decision. l deny your existence.
-You're a figment of me imagination.
-l am?
To prove it, l'm going to walk through you.
Step aside. There, what did l tell you?
This is dreadful.
-l don't exist.
-Of course not. l'm always seeing things.
Ask me daughter.
But if l don't exist, how is it l'm gradually becoming mortal?
-The saints preserve us. You are.
-Aye.
So are all the other little leprechauns ever since you stole our crock of gold.
Look at me. Look! lt's crept past me ankles already.
-Can't you hold out until the winter?
-l don't know. l got a peculiar human feeling in me thighs lately.
Your thighs? Don't let it go any higher, man.
-Mary and Joseph, lreland's ruined.
-Father!
-Someone's coming.
-Me daughter.
And now that you're half mortal, you're indecent. Here, here, take these.
Now, you heard me, now.
You take those clothes and--
Father!
Father!
Sharon!
Mr. McLonergan!
-Father!
-Sharon!
-Father!
-Sharon!
Mr. McLonergan!
-Father!
-What fools these mortals be.
-Mr.--
-Father--
Father!
Now, what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
Oh, it's you, Mr. Mahoney. l was looking for me father.
Not too long ago...
...they find a girl in the forest in the middle of the night...
...they'd think that she was...
...a witch. ls that so? Well.... lf you'll excuse me, l-- l'll be saying good evening to you.
You're not afraid of the werewolves?
Werewolves?
Our valley has its legends too, you know.
Haven't you noticed how strange the sky looks? lt is a trifle strange.
And look at the moon. lt is a cold, full moon.
The legend of the valley:
When the sky is strange...
...and the moon is full...
...the werewolves prowl.
-Unless....
-Unless?
That's a complicated part, and l know you're in a hurry.
Oh, no, Mr. Mahoney. l'd like to know the complicated part of the legend. lt's how to make yourself immune from the werewolf.
Well, how would l be doing that?
Well...
...you have to stand very, very close to the nicest, handsomest fellow around.
That must be you.
Must be.
Then you make yourself comfortable on the grass.
Now, you blink your eyes twice...
...and keep them closed.
Now you say...
...''petrified parsley'' over and over, real fast.
Petrified parsley, petrified parsley, petrified parsley....
-Feel immune yet?
-No.
Petrified parsley, petrified parsley, petrified parsley....
That's a lovely legend.
Who made it up? l did.
I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon
In your eyes
You and your glance
Make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle
You got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
I wanna cry
Wanna croon
Wanna laugh
Just like a loon
It's that old devil moon
In your eyes
I look at you
And glory be
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon
In your eyes
You and your glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night blazin' their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle
You got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
I wanna cry
I wanna croon
I want to laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon
In your eyes
Just when I think I'm
Free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with...
-...love
-Yeah
-Howard, old buddy!
-Hey, Woody!
How's the Luther Burbank of the swamp?
-Mr. Moneybags.
-How you doing? l've been waiting for you.
Where you been?
Sharon, meet Howard.
Howard, this is Sharon.
How do you do? Nice to meet you.
Woody, l'm glad you're here. l got the list all made out.
Fifty feet of styrene tubing, quarter inch,
250 pounds of nitrogen tripalminate--
The voice you hear is the voice of the greatest research botanist today.
He's gonna change our whole way of life...
...and he's gonna do it with these little flowers right here.
-They're all his babies.
-We're doing it together.
Woody thought it up, and l'm growing them up. l ain't nothing but a suede-shoe boy peddling tobacco.
But Howard--
Howard is the first man in history...
...to mate the mint plant with tobacco.
You realize what that means.
No.
You are looking at the mentholated tobacco plant.
Here, smell.
Smell the mint-julep nicotine.
That's nice. Really smells lovely. lt's a whole new form of tobacco life.
-lt only has one drawback.
-What's that?
Well, it doesn't burn. lt doesn't burn? lt's worse than asbestos. lt actually puts fires out.
We're working on it.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
Now that you're all back, fat with cash...
...gotta get to work.
Once l rig the styrene tubing...
...l'll take the nitrogen tripalminate in powdered form--
That's what l've been meaning to talk to you about.
What's that? The styrene tubing or the nitrogen tripalminate in powdered form?
-The cash.
-Yeah, what about the cash? l got some great things going. l made some contacts you wouldn't believe.
Wait, wait. Contacts? No cash?
Not a dime.
Well, you didn't bring back any cash, l'll go out and get some.
How? l'll get a job. Yeah.
But you've got a job, Howard.
That's to make it burn. Make it burn! ls that dedication?
Mr. Mahoney?
You're going to make plenty of money for everyone?
You bet.
Without doing a stitch of work for it?
Why not?
And is that what you call the''Mahoney theory of economics''?
No, but that's a pretty good name for it.
Why don't you grow ordinary tobacco that does burn?
Never get rich that way.
See you soon, Sharon.
Hey, Howard, buddy!
Don't take that personal. He's trained to do that to anyone what ain't white.
-You're the new boy from the agency.
-Yeah.
Okay, Stonewall.
Ain't l seen you somewhere?
-You worked here as a butler, didn't you?
-Oh, no, no.
No, sir.
Well, you'll like working here, boy. l've hired all of the senator's butlers for the past 10 years.
Hundreds of them. Of course, he's a little intolerant at times...
...but that's his blood pressure.
-What's your name?
-Howard.
Let me see you serve that julep.
Rawkins won't like that. That's no way to serve a julep. lt's too fast.
Get some shuffle into it.
You've seen some of the new movies, like Birth of a Nation...
...and Gone With the Wind, haven't you?
-Here, George, like this.
-Howard.
Yeah, okay, Jackson.
Your julep, sir. Master Rawkins, sir.
All frosted and minty....
You see, George?
Why do l have to shuffle?
Now, l don't have to explain that to you. lt makes for kindly feelings between employer and employee.
Once more, now. Try it again.
And not so fast this time.
How did you do that again? l don't understand you, Jackson. l mean, you don't walk or talk like you're supposed to.
You don't know how to serve a julep like you're supposed to.
You educated or something? l'm working on my master's.
Working on your master's what? lt's a college degree.
Now, don't mention the word''college'' around the senator. lt upsets him.
But that's beside the point.
Do you want a job here, or don't you?
Yes, sir, l do. l needs the money.
Well, that's all the more reason for you to make good here.
Then when you get your college degree, why, you got a job here for life.
-Buzz!
-Oh, l'll speak to you later.
You go around back and keep practicing, hear?
-Buzz, where are you?
-l'm over here, senator.
-l can't seem to see you.
-lt's these columns, senator.
-They sort of get in the way.
-Nonsense.
Those columns haven't moved an inch in a hundred years.
Meet me down by the glider.
Yep. Fine job you done yesterday, Buzz...
-...buying up all that land.
-Yes, sir. Bought up the whole valley.
Except one little parcel.
That'll teach them bureaucrats to stay where they belong, in Washington.
Cheap electric power.
Why don't they build their dam on the Potomac...
...instead of desecrating this heaven-given valley...
...with a lot of copper wire.
Electrocuting innocent bullfinches and sparrows.
Gentlemen...
...the festering tides of radicalism are upon us.
But before l yield up our glorious South...
...and her sister commonwealth, the U.S. of A...
...l will lay down my life. l will do more than that. l will filibuster.
Back, you crackpots. Forward, America.
Forward to the hallowed principles of our forefathers.
Forward to the sweet tranquility of the status quo.
Forward to yesterday.
Get this dog off-- Get him off me.
Caught him dead to rights, senator.
Spank on your property.
Oh, damn it, sheriff, can't you arrest a couple of chicken thieves...
...without disturbing the whole countryside?
Worse than chicken thieves this time.
These are geologists from Washington.
Geologists?
Two?
-l only see one.
-Senator.
This is a geological survey of the soil in this area in connection with the dam. l don't need nobody to tell me what's on my land.
Especially one of his kind.
Look, l read the findings on this meter. lt detected gold on your property this afternoon.
You found what on my property? lt located an amazing concentration of gold.
The meter reacted so violently, it broke the needle.
We're sorry about that needle, but we'll reimburse you. Now....
Just where did this unfortunate needle-breaking accident occur?
Parcel lot number seven, right outside Rainbow Valley.
-Oh, my God.
-What are you mumbling about, Buzz? lnvite these gentlemen up on the veranda. lt isn't every day we're honored with the presence...
...of two distinguished scientists from Washington, D.C.
Sorry, senator, we've got more ground to cover.
Gentlemen, l wish you'd accept my hospitality.
Senator?
That was the strip l told you about.
-What strip?
-The one we couldn't buy.
Well, gentlemen, l'm sorry you gotta rush off like this...
...but you hurry back real soon, now, hear?
We couldn't buy it? Who bought it?
We found out it was a man named Finian McLonergan.
Yankee brain!
Why weren't you prepared for him? l never saw him before.
He's an immigrant.
My family's been having trouble with immigrants...
-...ever since they come to this country!
-Don't you get excited!
You'll feel better when you've had your julep.
To hell with my julep!
Get me a Bromo, quick.
Howard!
Howard! Bring the senator a Bromo-Seltzer, quick!
And call my lawyer.
Tell him to find a loophole.
Where's that Bromo?
-Where's that Bromo, Howard?
-My loophole's choking me.
Where's that Bromo?
Coming, master. Coming. l'm coming all in there, yes, sir.
Yeah, l'm coming.
Will you hurry up on that Bromo?!
You're gonna enjoy it once l get to you.
-Get him his Bromo!
-Coming in there fast as l can.
-Will you hurry up with it?!
-Coming right there, fix your head good.
Mercy, sure gonna make you feel like you flying.
-Please, please hurry up with the--
-Come on, Howard!
Come on!
Howard, come on!
-Please bring me my--
-Howard!
Oh, Lord, l'm coming in.
Howard! Come on, bring that!
Get over here!
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that willow tree
Still weepin' there?
Does that laddie
With the twinklin' eye
Come whistlin' by
And does he walk away
Sad and dreamy there
-Sharon!
-Aye?
-Haven't you laundered my shirt yet?
-lt's coming, it's coming.
Not to see me there?
Not so hard. You'll be wringing the lrish out of the linen. lt is the neck of the Mahoney l'm wringing.
Oh, good, good, good. Lover's quarrel.
Healthy sign.
Are you sure? l know true devotion when l see it. l know a fine, upstanding darling of a man when l see one.
He's leaving for parts unknown this morning.
He's what? He's running out on you?
He's off to sell tobacco that doesn't burn. He's a schemer.
-You're well rid of him.
-An impractical dreamer.
-lt's deplorable.
-Total no-good bounder.
Get the wretch out of your mind.
-He's just like you.
-Aye, a darling of a man.
Now, look. Now, just a minute.
Now, don't you be crying.
A special rose...
...for your hair. lt has magical properties.
Beautiful bride you'll be.
All by myself, or is there a man involved?
Aye, there is.
He doesn't know it, but before sundown...
...Mr. Woody Mahoney will find himself betroth-ted to you.
''Betrothed.''
Betroth-ted!
How are things
In Glocca Morra
This...
...fine....
Well, this is a pretty bucket of fish.
How would you explain these shenanigans?
-lf you won't speak, back into the well.
-Oh, no! No!
So you've found your tongue.
Speak up for yourself.
-Why were you hiding in that well?
-l wasn't hiding.
Someone set me on fire, and l had to put myself out.
Oh, l see. Who was it put the torch to you?
A sunbeam.
-A sunbeam?
-Sunbeam disguised as a fairy queen.
But you can't fool me. l know a sunbeam when l see one.
Thank you.
-You're very poetical.
-Don't come too close! l'll have to jump again! l'm beginning to understand. l've known that feeling myself.
-You have?
-Well, only recently.
Came over me this morning, as you were sunning your hair by the brook. ls it a warmish...
...kind of glowish, kind of peculiarish sensation?
Oh, no, it's sort of a shiverish, kind of quiverish, flibbertigibberish sensation.
-Do you feel hummingbirds in your heart?
-Butterflies in my feet.
-Bees in your bonnet?
-Stars in my britches.
Does it make you want to dance?
-l hadn't noticed.
-And sing?
Oh, it does, it does.
Something sweet
Something sort of grandish
Sweeps my soul
When thou art near
My heart feels
So sugar-candish
My head feels
So ginger beer
Something so darish
So''I don't car-ish''
Stirs me from limb to limb
It's so terrifish
Magnifish, delish
To have such an amorish
Glamorish dish
We could be
Oh, so bride-and-groomish
Skies could be
So bluish blue
Life could be
So love-in-bloom-ish
If my ish-es
Could come true
Thou art sweet
Thou art sort of grandish
Thou outlandish cavalier
From now on
We're hand-in-handish
-Romeo
-And Guinevere
Thou art so adorish
Toujour l'amourish
I'm so cherchez la femme
Why should I vanquish
Relinquish, resish?
When I simply relish
This hellish condish
I might be mannish or mouse-ish
I might be a fowl or fish
But with thee I'm Eisenhows-ish
Please accept my proposish
You're under my skin-ish
So please be give in-ish
Or it's the begin-ish
Of the finish of me
What was that splash?
'Twas me, singing a duet.
A duet? By yourself?
Well, it could be, you know.
After all, l'm a witch, remember?
Train's pulling out soon. l wanted to say goodbye.
Well, goodbye.
-What kind of a goodbye is that?
-The best kind. Short, sweet and final.
How come l feel you're losing interest in me?
-Losing? Losing?
-l'm going away so l can come back...
-...and make everybody rich!
-Lost!
Sharon.
We're having a party
We're having a party
Oh, Finian's party we're having today
We're having a party
We're having a party....
Hey, what's going on?
-What's the occasion, Mr. McLonergan?
-What? Haven't you heard the gossip?
Me daughter Sharon's getting betroth-ted today.
Singing a duet with herself!
Sharon's getting betroth-ted
Sharon is getting betroth-ted today
Sharon is getting betroth-ted.... l hope you won't be taking it too hard, son.
-But then you'll be leaving town anyhow.
-l got a deal cooking, Mr. McLonergan-- l understand when a man's got a deal cooking.
He's got to cook it, or it won't get cooked.
On the other hand, many deals are cooked at home in your own pot...
...of gold.
-Gold?
-But then again...
...what is the cold, hard metal compared to the golden hair of the girl you love?
-Nothing.
-You're right.
Then tell me, why are you gallivanting all over the countryside...
...promoting and cooking deals when the lady you fancy is to be betroth-ted?
Well, who's she gonna marry? l hope you won't be after taking it too hard.
Why should l? lt's only love.
-That's a sensible attitude.
-Right.
Wait a minute! Who's the guy?
Now, who is he?
Now, if l tell you, you won't be making any trouble? l promise.
Very well. lt was last night she met him in the forest...
...and they sang about the moon.
Mr. McLonergan, that was me.
-Well, was it, now?
-Yeah.
Are you sure?
Of course! lt was me all along.
Well, that's a blessed relief.
Therefore, it's you that's getting betroth-ted today.
-''Betrothed.''
-Oh, yes, betrothed.
Finian McLonergan.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Susan's trying to tell us something.
-What's she saying?
-l can't tell. lt's a secret.
-Woody, you tell them.
-Okay.
A secret, a secret
She says she's got a secret
A secret, a secret
A secret kind of secret
She's achin' for to shout it
To every daffodil
And tell the world about it
In fact, she says she will
-She says
-She says
If this isn't love
The whole world is crazy
If this isn't love
I'm daft as a daisy
With moons all around
And cows jumpin' over
There's something amiss
And I'll eat my hat if this isn't love
I'm feeling like the apple
On top of William Tell
With this I cannot grapple
-Because
-Because
You're so adora-bell
If this isn't love
Then winter is summer
Give in to summer
-If this isn't love
-If this isn't love
-My heart needs a plumber
-It needs a plumber
I'm swinging on stars
And ridin' on rainbows
I'm bustin' with bliss
And I'll kiss your hand if this isn't love
If this isn't love
There's no Glocca Morra
If this isn't love
I'm Zsa Zsa Gabor-a
If this is a dream
And if I should wake up
Will you hear a hiss
Will my face be red if this isn't love
I'm gettin' tired of waitin'
And stickin' to the rules
This feelin' calls for matin'
Like birds and bees and other animules
If this isn't love
We're all seein' double
If this isn't love
We're really in trouble
-If she's not the girl
-And he's not the hero
A kiss ain't a kiss
It's a crisis, man, if this isn't love
If this isn't love
He's happy to shout
And to tell the world about it
And I'll kiss your hand
If this isn't love
McLonergan!
How dare you come back here? Didn't l tell you you're an optical delusion? l was ready to believe you yesterday, but not today.
-Today l've got proof.
-What proof?
Does an optical illusion feel such a hungry yearning, burning inside of him?
Does an optical illusion feel the beat of the tom-tom...
...in the roaring traffic's boom in his lonely room?
You flying high and wide on a magic-carpet ride...
...full of butterflies inside?
Aye, and what's worse, smoke keeps coming out of me eyes.
You go round like an elevator lost in the tide?
That's the feeling!
Day and night, night and day!
Give me your daughter.
-What's she got to do with it?
-She's the one under my skin.
-Leprechaun, you're playing with fire.
-l know, and the fire's winning! l don't wanna be human. l don't wanna be human.
-lt's too inhuman.
-You're neurotic.
-Who's forcing you to be human?
-You are, by keeping my crock of gold! l'm only lend-leasing it. Give me a few weeks and l'll return it with interest.
Five and a quarter little crocks. l hope you're not using it to make wishes. ln the hands of a mortal it's only good for three, and after it becomes dross.
The way you talk, anyone would think l never had a pot to wish on. l'm sorry, Mr. McLonergan. l'm being a nuisance.
You're damn right you are!
You're worse than that!
You're the nemesis on me premises.
You're endangering me whole project.
-Where's your passport?
-What's that? l thought so. How dare you come into a free country without a passport? l'm legal, all right. l came in as a Christmas tree.
But l'm not leaving till l see me crock!
And l'm seeing me congressman,
Senator Rawkins...
...and l'm having you deported!
You're a member of a subversive, underground group...
...taking its orders from Dublin!
Woody's gettin' betroth-ted
Woody is gettin' betroth-ted today
Hey, mister, did you see our rooster? l got enough troubles of me own, thank you.
What kind of a rooster was he?
-He had pink--
-Green feet--
-And a yellow--
-Wait a minute. Wait!
-How many roosters did you lose?
-One!
-One rooster, all those colors?
-Yeah!
Well, now, let me see, now.
-Would this be it?
-Yeah!
-He must be magic!
-That's right! You get the prize.
-Do you do other magical things too?
-l do, but we'll have to act very quickly.
-l need your help. Will you help me?
-Yeah!
Now, listen. Somewhere hidden in the ground around here...
...is a little yellow crock. lf any of you find it for me, you can pick anything you like...
...here in me little magic book.
That's nothing!
We all have one of those.
Yes, but the difference is, from mine you can have anything you choose.
-Can l have a banjo?
-Can l get a fishing rod?
-Can l have an elephant?
-You can have anything you like...
-...that's made in fairyland.
-Without money?
There'll be things
Plenty-ish for all-ish
Wonderish toys
And magic tricks
Electrish trains
And basketball-ish
Mintish drops
And licorish sticks
Life will be keen-ish
All Halloween-ish
And jelly bean-ish too
With ice cream and cake-ish
And soda to sup
And no bellyache-ish
To wakish you up
There will be
Such delicious dishes
And we'll end
This daffish plot
For we'll go
From rags to rishes
When we find
That goldish pot
There'll be chocolate custish
With hot dogs and mustish
But Shears and Robustish
Must firstish come through
You folks belong here?
Yeah.
You mean you all live here on this property together?
-Yeah.
-This is my property, Your Honor.
McLonergan.
Now, Mr. Lonergan, l understand you got stuck...
...with this here arid, gopher-infested property a couple of days ago.
How would you like to unload it for, say, a profit of 30 percent?
-lt's the McLonergan theory giving birth.
-What do you say? l couldn't consider any propositions for six months.
You see, l'm conducting certain experiments.
Now, let me ask you, sir, just what kind of experiments?
Well, you see, Father is a mineralogist from the old country.
He can make gold sprout out of the ground.
Gold? There ain't no gold in lreland. l myself discovered a vein our countrymen have been searching for...
...since the reign of Alfred the Thoughtless.
Who?
You never heard of Alfred the Thoughtless?
Well, he was King of Erin, following his father, Thomas the Temporary...
...who in turn was the only son of the virgin queen, Serena the Spotless.
Are you willing to sell this land or ain't you? l'm willing and l'm wanting, but l'm waiting. l'm sorry you said that. lt'll put me to the trouble...
...of issuing a writ of seizure on all this land.
-Here's the writ, senator.
-Now, don't be crude, Buzz. l hate to do this to you...
-...but you've been violating the law.
-Since when?
This afternoon. l just finished drafting this.
''Local ordinance number 7428.
Be it known that in the county of Rainbow Valley...
...it is a felony for members of the
Caucasian and Negro races--'' lt would seem to me that this law could not be a legal law.
Of course it's legal! l don't know where you immigrants get these foreign ideas.
From a book the immigration officer gave us.
-Called the United States Constitution.
-Haven't you read it? l don't have time to read it, l'm too busy defending it! l rest me case. l wish you folks would understand our traditions. l wish--
Now, don't get in the habit of making wishes on me property! lt's not your property. l'll thank you to get off it.
And take your black friends with you.
-l don't wanna go!
-Shush, Henry.
You're saying you're taking this land from these people because they're black?
-Don't let them chase us!
-Shut this kid up.
He's making me look like a bully.
Sheriff, get them out of here!
You heard the senator. You folks better start packing your things. ls Henry the wrong color?
No, of course not.
He's the right color.
But there's something wrong with the world.
-l wish--
-Sharon! Sharon!
There's something wrong with the world you've made for people like Henry! l wish you could know what that world is like. l wish to God you were black! l'm a son of a biscuit.
Oh, my God! What happened?
-Stonewall!
-Somebody get a doctor!
Father, what have l done?
You shouldn't go around me property making wishes.
Hey, sorry, buddy, but it's that great come-and-get-it day!
-What's going on?
-The senator tried to take our land away.
Then l lost me temper with him, and l shouted at him...
...and he turned black!
Don't worry. That happens every time he meets somebody he disagrees with.
He sees red, turns purple with rage and yells himself black in the face.
But we don't need to worry about him anymore.
We don't have to worry about anything anymore. We got good news!
-A telegram for Finian.
-For me?
-Let me see it!
-Oh, no.
This is a singing telegram.
''Dear sir, after investigating your standing in the community...
...and finding you to be a citizen of high character...
...we have taken the liberty of opening an unlimited charge account...
...for you and your associates.''
Signed,''Shears Robust Company.'' lt says,''P.S. We hear gold...
...has been discovered on your property. Congratulations!''
Gold?
-Must be a mistake here!
-Mistake?
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, what about this here?
Hey, come on, hurry up!
Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Didn't you hear the telegram?
We got credit! Wait!
Credit! Hold it, you're gonna dig up this whole valley. l've waited all my life for a break like this.
Yeah, but....
Don't you see, don't you know what credit means?
Credit means we can buy ourselves a tractor.
We can get ourselves a new planting machine, some tools...
...we can get laboratory equipment for Howard.
We can get our mentholated tobacco burning.
We're gonna make more money than you could get from digging up gold!
-He's right, you know.
-All right, Woody, when?
We want it now, Woody!
We want it right now.
Yeah. When?
When, Woody? When?
-When?
-Yeah, Woody. When?

Come-and-get-it-day
Great day
Won't it be fun

-Money is hay

Come-and-get-it day
When the idle poor
Become the idle rich
You'll never know just who is who
Or who is which
Won't it be rich
When everyone's poor relative
Becomes a Rockefellertive
And palms no longer itch?
What a switch!
When we all have ermine
And plastic teeth
How will we determine
Who's who underneath?
And when all your neighbors
Are upper class
You won't know your Joneses
From your...Astors
Let's toast the day
The day we drink that drinkie up
But with the little pinkie up
The day on which
The idle poor
Become the idle rich
When a rich man
Doesn't want to work
He's a bon vivant
Yes, he's a bon vivant
But when a poor man
Doesn't want to work
He's a loafer, he's a lounger
He's a lazy good-for-nothing
He's a jerk
When a rich man
Loses on a horse
Isn't he the sport, ho-ho!
Isn't he the sport?
But when a poor man
Loses on a horse
He's a gambler, he's a spender
He's a low-life, he's a reason for divorce
When a rich man chases after dames
He's a man about town
Oh, yes, a man about town
But when a poor man
Chases after dames
He's a bounder, he's rounder
He's a rotter and a lot of dirty names
When the idle poor
Become the idle rich
You'll never know just who is who
Or who is which
No one will see
The Irish or the Slav in you
For when you're on Park Avenue
Cornelius and Mike
Look alike
When poor Tweedledum
Is rich Tweedledee
This discrimination
Will no longer be
When we're in the dough
And off of the nut
You won't know your banker
From your...butler
Come on, Finian!
-Yay, Finian!
-Yeah, Finian!
Go, Finian!
Let's make the switch
With just a few annuities
We'll hide those incongruities
In cloaks from Abercrombie Fitch
-When the idle poor
-When the idle poor
-Become the idle rich
-Become the idle rich
When the idle poor
Become the idle...
...rich
What a mess!
Well, l'm busy.
You gotta clean this place up, man. lt's a firetrap. l wish....
Do you see that?
You think this--?
-Are you sure?
-l think....
Are you sure?!
-No.
-Let's try it, come on. l gotta admit something to you, Howard. l never really thought this day would come, you know.
Come on. lt burns! lt burns!
You did it, Howard.
You did it! You did it! lt burns! lt burns!
-lt's gone out. Here.
-No, no, no. Still burning. lt burns, Howard...
...but it doesn't smoke.
You're kidding me.
Woody, quick!
The sheriff is down by the brook!
Come on, you got lead in your pants?
Doesn't smoke?
What's going on here?
This is the DA, Woody.
You better talk respectful.
How does this concern you?
-This is my fiancée.
-Well, how nice. l'll ask you. What do you know about the whereabouts of Senator Rawkins?
Nothing, and neither does she.
There's 50 witnesses saw her do her mumbo jumbo.
And the split second she did,
Rawkins turned black, disappeared.
-That's crazy talk!
-Folks around here are getting nervous.
Could be dangerous.
You're supposed to keep law and order around here, not this white suit.
That's why we're conducting this preliminary investigation...
...on charge of witchcraft.
Witchcraft?
-You gotta be kidding.
-Concludes Tuesday.
By which day, Rawkins had better be produced in the flesh. l'm sorry, but we're gonna be busy on Tuesday.
-We're getting married.
-Don't count on that...
...or anything else if Rawkins isn't back.
Bye!
Oh, Woody, you're grandish.
You've made me deliriously happy.
Happy?
Trouble makes you happy? Come on.
No, you make me happy.
-You don't know why, do you?
-No, why?
Because you said it.
And you said it all by yourself.
You volunteered it without me, without magic, without me father...
-...twisting and tricking you into it.
-What'd l say?
That l'm your fiancée, which is to say...
...l'm your love. lt is grandish!
And we're gonna get married on Tuesday. lt's grandish.
Didn't know what l was saying.
Something came over me, like a spell come over me.
Hey, wait a minute, now. lt ain't true, is it?
Ain't what true?
About you being a witch.
Of course it's true.
Me and my glance
Make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To my razzle-dazzle
-Oh, you got me flyin' high and wide
-Yeah
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
I wanna cry, wanna croon
I wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon
In your eyes
Kiss me.
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little stream
Still a-ripplin' there?
Does the lassie
With the twinklin' eye
Go whistlin' by
And does she walk away
Sad and dreamy there
Not to see me there?
So I ask
Each weepin' willow
And each brook--
Give me that, boy!
You don't have to grab, mister.
There's plenty of apples around.
-Well, l don't see any.
-Because you're mortal!
You're mortal! Mortals can never see all the apples there are to be had.
An apple here. An apple there.
Little red apples everywhere.
You must be very hungry.
Would you like a sandwich?
Yeah.
Nice Virginia ham.
This is cheese! l ordered ham!
Forced to eat cheese.
-Forced to hide out like a hunted possum.
-Who are you hiding from?
My associates, my people, my dog...
...my whole way of life.
-l can't show myself like this.
-What's wrong with you?
Are you blind, boy?
Can't you see l'm black? l think it's very becoming.
Well, it isn't! l'm a white man, damn it! l'm a white man!
At least l was until a couple of days ago.
Well, that's a coincidence. l was green a couple of weeks ago!
Don't you find the change of color interesting?
No, l don't!
And they won't get away with it.
They won't get away with it!
Don't have to get so excited. l think it's just ridiculous making such a fuss about a person's color.
Well, you don't realize what it's like being black here.
But you're human!
A rose is a rose is a rose
Despite the color of your nose
You don't understand, boy.
-You're nothing when you're black!
-Nothing? Who says so?
-The law says.
-Well, it's a silly law.
But is it a legal law?
Of course it's legal. l wrote it myself!
-Change it back.
-How am l gonna do that?
-You said you had it changed days ago.
-l said no such thing.
-Some witch wished it on me.
-A witch! A witch!
-l can help you. What sort of a witch?
-l didn't look her up in Who's Who!
She's bound to be in Which Is Witch. lt lists their curses and cures--
Boy, go away, will you! l see your trouble now, mister.
You're too unfriendly. l'm in no condition for friendship!
That witch's fault!
She gave you a new outside...
...and she should've given you a new inside.
-That's very incompetent.
-Will you go away!
This will give witchcraft a bad name. lt'll set the entire profession back 100 years. l'll have to do something about it.
Me reputation's at stake. l'll have to alter your personality.
Stand up, please.
-Why don't you leave me alone.
-This won't be too hard.
All we have to do is to broaden out that narrow mind a little...
...reduce some of that bigotry...
...and your pomposity won't show through at all.
Wait till they see you in your new spring psyche.
People will say you're in love.
Now....
Fiddle, foddle
Foil and fiddle
Cure this fuddled individual
Whirl, ye waters, and unwind
This tangled, medieval mind
Breath of bee and bluebird's wing
Make this scowling spirit sing
Balm of briar, sandalwood
Season him with brotherhood
Magic vapors, make this person
A better person
Not a worse one
He sleeps!
The cure is beginning to work!
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Golden slippers I laid away
Can't touch'em till my wedding day
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Golden slippers I laid away
Until my wedding day, oh!
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Oh--
Brother!
Brother, you're the voice in the wilderness.
Allow me the honor of shaking your hand.
Well, thank you, friend. lt's nice to be able to talk to somebody again.
Just whom, may l ask, do we have the unexpected pleasure of meeting up with?
Just call me Bill.
You folks from around here?
-We're from around everywhere.
-Yeah. We travel and we sing.
Haven't you ever heard of the Passion Pilgrim Gospeleers? l've been out of touch with the gospel recently.
We're the prize-winningest,
Gospel-singingest quartet...
...east of the Rockies!
Quartet? Why, there's only three of you.
Well, you see, brother, we suffered a casualty last night.
Yes, there was our number-four man,
Russ, suddenly taken with temptation.
And in desperation, he cries out:
-''Get thee behind me, Satan!''
-And Satan got--
-Satan pushed--
-He pushed him--
Right into the arms of a bouncing
Babylonian Jezebel...
-...from Biloxi, Mississippi.
-Oh, the soul was strong...
...but the flesh was weak.
And that's why divine providence led us to you.
You may be Bill...
...but that voice inside you is Russ. l wouldn't be a bit surprised. l had a lot of shuffling around lately.
Well, your shuffling days are over.
With your voice, we can go right on being a prize-winning quartet.
-l can make a living singing with you?
-There's a handful of ways.
Either tote that barge.
-Lift that bale.
-Shine that shoe.
-Or sing.
-We sing.
But before we do, somebody's either gotta get buried or get married.
Over in Rainbow Valley, there's a couple just aching to be spliced.
And a $20 bill just aching to be split.
Will you join us?
Brothers, you are now a quartet!
Well, good!
Now, in preparation for this ceremony...
...we take our text from Genesis, wherein it says:
Adam and Eve begat Cain and Abel.
From thence on, the history of the world is just the history of who begat who.
-Well, what do l sing in that?
-You carry the big theme of this song.
You stress the word''begat'' and keep stressing it.
Can you remember that? l got it!
-I got it
-I got it
I got it
We got it
The Lord made Adam
The Lord made Eve
He made them both
A little bit naive
They lived as free as a summer breeze
Without pajamas and without chemise
Until they stumbled on the apple trees
Then she looked at him
And he looked at her
And they knew immediately
What the world was fer
He said,''Give me my cane''
He said,''Give me my hat''
The time has come
To begin the begat
The begat
The begat
So they begat Cain
And they begat Abel
Who begat the rabble
At the tower of Babel
-They begat the Cohens
-They begat O'Rourkes
And they begat the people
Who believed in storks
Lordy, Lordy
How they did begat
-How they be-be-begat
-Even more than that
When the begat
Got to gettin' under par
They begat the daughters
Of the D.A.R
They begat the Babbitts
Of the bourgeoisie
Who begat the misbegotten VIPs
They begat
They begat
It was pleasin' to Jezebel
Pleasin' to Ruth
It pleased
the League of Women Shoppers In Duluth
Though the movie censors
Tried the facts to hide
The moviegoers up and multiplied
Lordy, Lordy
How they multiplied!
-How they multiplied
-How they multiplied
-Soon it swept the world
-Every land and lingo
-It became the rage
-It was bigger than bingo
The white begat, the red begat
The folks
Who shoulda stood in bed begat
The Greeks begat
The Swedes begat
Why, even Britishers in tweed begat
And Lordy, Lordy
What the seeds begat!
-The Lats and Lithuanians
-Begat
-Scranton, Pennsylvanians
-Begat
-Strict vegetarians
-Begat
-Honorary Aryans
-Begat
-Startin' from Genesis
-We begat
-Heroes and menaces
-Begat
-Fat filibusterers
-Begat
-Income tax adjusterers
-Begat
-'Twas naturaler and naturaler
-To begat
-And sometimes the bachelor
-He begat
It didn't matter which-a-ways
They begat
Sons of habitués
Begat
-So begats them all
-So bless them all!
-Who go to bat
-Who go to bat
And heed the call
Of the begat
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
'Twas a sumptuous gift
To bequeath to a child
For the lure of that song
Keeps my head runnin' wild
So I searched all the earth
And I scanned all the skies
And I found it at last
In my own true love's eyes
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today--
Stand back, everybody!
-Don't want any trouble.
-Just what do you want?
Miss Sharon McLonergan.
Mrs. Sharon Mahoney in a few minutes, if you don't mind.
Dearly beloved...
...we are gathered here today to join this man and this woman--
No, no, no, no, no, no!
-l got a warrant for your arrest.
-On what charge?
The People v. Miss Sharon McLonergan.
-The charge is demoting!
-''Demoting''?
Demoting a member of the white race,
Senator Rawkins...
-...down to a member of the Negro race.
-By means of witchcraft.
There's a law against witchcraft in this state.
Yes, l know. lt was passed in 1690! l think it's about time we repealed that law. Right now!
Yeah!
Hold it! Hold it, l said!
Arrest that witch.
All right, Bill.
-Do your duty.
-Sure thing.
All right, come and get me, then!
Arrest her, Sam! Arrest her!
-Arrest her, Sam.
-Well, l'm only a second deputy.
-You're the first.
-Sheriff, quit stalling. Arrest her!
Turn them into pumpkins, Sharon.
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
Don't you try any hocus-pocus.
You can't goofer us now.
That there's lizard dust.
Lizard dust?
Witchcraft?
-You don't really believe l'm a witch?
-Arrest her!
Wait a minute, now.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, don't let her bedevil you.
A witch she is, and a witch she's always been.
Finian....
-He doesn't know what he's saying.
-Oh, yes, l do.
By the age of 10, she'd already developed her uncanny powers...
...and was changing me good whiskey into milk. lt was a crisis!
From then on, one change led to another...
...and now you're witnesses to this unhappy climax.
-She's changed a white man into a black.
-Let me talk to you.
Leave me alone. l'm doing the right thing.
All right, let's go.
Wait a minute!
You know, being a witch, she can also change a black man into a white.
She can make Rawkins white again?
-Or any color that Your Honor pleases.
-All right!
Turn him into a white man now.
-Just a minute! l got something to say.
-By God!
-Senator Rawkins.
-Calm yourself, senator.
You're in no position to have opinions right now.
Who's in a better position? Boy, can l see both sides of this question!
How much time will she need?
Well, for a bit of a thing like that, l would say until the crack of dawn. l will not be used as evidence...
-...in any witchcraft trial!
-Yeah!
Take him, boys! He's Exhibit A!
Her too!
Now, now, now...
...for your own safety's sake...
...if l were you, l wouldn't be trying to move her or him.
All right.
The crack of dawn...
...or it'll be the crack of doom, you hear?
Sheriff, move them all out but these two.
Clear everybody out!
Come on! Move!
Sit down!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute! Wait a....
-Sit down.
-Get out of here, boy!
Get that boy out of here!
The crock's in the ground, and all's well with the world. lt's gone! lt's gone. lt's not here.
Leprechaun! Og!
Nemesis! Og!
Og!
Sharon!
Sharon McLonergan!
Sharon?
Sharon.
Look at me, Sharon. l'm 90 percent mortal now.
And 100 percent miserable. lt's a frenzy, a frenzy.
And the only cure for it is you.
Sharon? l feel better already just being near you.
The scent of your hair...
...the touch of your hand.
Oh, the miracle of it, the miracle of it, the sweet, sweet miracle of it.
She loves me.
Her hand fits me cheek.
Oh, Sharon, you're the only one, the only one!
You're not Sharon at all.
You're Susan the Silent.
Yet l still feel the same frenzy for you. ls this what it's like to be mortal? ls every girl the only girl? l'm beginning to like it.
Oh, my heart is beating wildly
And it's all because you're here
When I'm not near
The girl I love
I love the girl I'm near
Every femme that flutters by me
Is a flame that must be fanned
When I can't fondle
The hand I'm fond of
I fondle the hand at hand
My heart's in a pickle
It's constantly fickle
And not too''partickle,'' I fear
When I'm not near
The girl I love
I love the girl I'm near
Sharon! l mean, Susan.
Susan!
What if they're tall and tender?
What if they're small and slender?
Long as they've got that gender
I surrender
Always I can't refuse'em
Always my feet pursues'em
Long as they got a bosom
I woos'em
I love the girl I'm near
When I'm not near
The girl I love
I love the girl I'm near
I'm confessin' a confession
And I hope I'm not verbose
When I'm not close to
The kiss that I cling to
I cling to the kiss that's close
As I'm more and more a mortal
I am more and more a case
When I'm not facing
The face that I fancy
I fancy the face I face
For Sharon I'm carin'
But Susan I'm choosin'
I'm faithful to whos'n is here
When I'm not near
The girl I love
I love the girl...
...I'm near
So there you are!
The wrath of Ozymandias on you!
From dusk to sunup, l've searched forest and hill...
...and l find you philandering with a woman in your arms.
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong!
At a moment like this?
-Have you forgotten me daughter?
-l have not!
She's the woman l love...
...present company excepted.
The shamrock of her eyes, and her voice like the bells of St. Mary's....
-Has anything happened?
-lndeed, it has.
This is her last sunrise.
Twenty minutes from now, at dawn...
... the glory that was Sharon...
...and the boy that was her beloved will perish in smoke and flame. l told you the gold brings doom and gloom.
Gloom and doom!
Don't blame the gold!
You're the culprit!
-l?
-Aye. lf you weren't a leprechaun...
...you'd have had no gold. lf you had none, l wouldn't have borrowed it. l wouldn't have come, and me daughter wouldn't be burned for witchcraft! lt's my fault. lt's all my fault.
Oh, the merciful saints forgive me.
Her broken father will forgive you too, if you'd just spare a little magic for her.
Oh, anything, Mr. McLonergan.
I'd do anything!
Turn the senator white again
and save Sharon's life!
Og, we've only 20 minutes!
Well, Sambo.
You don't look like you lightened up a smidgen. l could do it in a minute and have 19 left.
Thank heavens. l knew you wouldn't fail me.
Why not wait 19 minutes...
...and leave it all to the last minute. lt's more dramatic.
Now, Og, now!
-lt's a matter of life and death!
-Very well, Mr. McLonergan.
-l just need one thing from you.
-What is it?
-Speak up, man. What do you need?
-A crock of gold.
Give me strength to resist me own strength to keep from choking him!
You stand there and pretend you haven't got it?
-But l haven't got it!
-Then why can't l find it? l dug more holes this weary night than all the gophers in Christendom!
Think back to when you buried it.
What were you doing? l don't know! How would l know? l.... l had a jug of whiskey in one hand and the crock of gold in the other--
You might've buried the jug and swallowed the crock.
You Machiavellian, half-pint pirate, stealing me property! l want it back.
-Please, Mr. McLonergan, l wish l had it.
-Where is it?
-l haven't got it.
-l'll throttle it out of you! l want it back!
Where is it? Where is it?
You perfidious little wretch....
-l'll throttle it out of you.
-l don't know where it is!
Where is it? l wish l....
-Where is it?
-l wish l.... lt's almost dawn.
They can't do it to her.
It'll be one of me or 100 of them!
Og...
...if you have a mite of merciful magic left, help me save me daughter's life.
Will you, now?
Oh, Susan, it's a crisis.
A crisis.
They're gonna burn Sharon for a witch.
She's not a witch.
She must've been standing by the crock when she made the wish.
Susan...
...you must've been there.
Where was Sharon standing?
Where was she...?
Oh, it's no good asking you.
You can't hear me. l'll have to ask somebody else.
There's no time.
Susan, come here.
Sit down. Look...
...l'll dance you the questions, and you dance me the answers, you see?
Questions, answers, right? l'll put it another way.
Susan, Susan, Susan....
You're a darling girl...
...and l love you very much...
...but l just wish to God you could talk. l love you. l love you.
Beautiful new words.
Will you say them again? l love you.
She loves me.
She loves me!
You're talking, Susan!
Where was Sharon standing?
-l love you!
-Oh, l know that.
But you're talking.
That means l must've wished you into it.
Which means l must've been standing over the crock.
The crock, the crock.... lt looks like you are permanently a black man.
Oh, my heavens.
What have l done?
The crock.
There's only one wish left.
The last one. lf l use it to wish the senator white...
...l'd never be a leprechaun again.
-We gotta sound the alarm.
-Yes.
Mr. Rodgers, sound the alarm.
Fire.
Fire.
Fire.
But l don't wanna be mortal. l wanna go back to fairyland.
Fairyland was never like this.
Where is she?
Rawkins, you blackguard, l wish you white!
-She turned him white.
-He's done it!
Thank you, Og.
Release those prisoners!
Come on! Keep that water coming in here!
-Keep the water coming!
-Keep the water coming.
-Keep the water coming!
-Keep the water coming!
-Keep the water coming!
-Susan is talking!
-Susan's talking!
-Susan's talking!
-Susan's talking.
-Susan's talking.
-Susan's talking.
-Susan's talking.
Susan....
Susan's talking?
Woody!
-Susan's talking!
-What?
-Susan's talking!
-ls it true?
Well, say something, will you? l've been waiting 20 years! lsn't it grandish, Woody?
You used the crock to wish back
Susan's tongue.
-Aye.
-And you used up the last wish.
And now the crock has turned to worthless dross.
Aye. Right, Mr. McLonergan.
Dross, worthless dross.
Hey, Woody! Over here!
The lab's going!
Four years of sweat and work, and it's all going up in smoke. lt's all right, Howard. We'll put it out.
No! No! lt's smoking!
Homegrown mentholated smoke!
I searched all the earth
And I scanned all the skies
And I found it at last
In my own true love's eyes
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over the hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream l now pronounce you...
...man and wife.
Father...
...are you leaving us?
Aye. l've had Fort Knox. l see.
Things are indeed hopeless.
Hopeless...
...but they're not serious.
But where are you going?
To find me a rainbow...
...Finian's Rainbow. lt never fails to come up when a McLonergan is down.
Sure, there may not be a pot of gold at the end of it...
...but there's a beautiful new world under it.
Make it shine on Sharon.
Goodbye, me darling.
Goodbye, me friends. l'll see you all in Glocca Morra.
Sharon, where is Glocca Morra?
Well, you see, it's always somewhere...
...over there.
So to every weepin' willow
To each brook along the way
To each lad who comes a-whistlin'
''Too-ra-lay''
May we meet in Glocca Morra
Some fine day
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook
Still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny Cove
Through Killybegs,
Kilkerry and Kildaire?
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that willow tree
Still weeping there?
Does that laddie
With the twinkling eye
Come whistling by
And does he walk away
Sad and dreamy there
Not to see me there?
So I'll ask each weeping willow
And each brook along the way
And each lad
That comes a-whistlin'
''Too-ra-lay''
''How are things in Glocca Morra...
... this fine day?''

Se駉r Don Pedro,
I 'v e found the answer.
Le漵 have some wine.
Perhaps this midnight oil will mark our vigil for the last time tonight.
Come, se駉r, please,
I 'd like to show you something.
You're sad.
Le漵 drin k this fine wine.
We'll all soon come to rest in the eternal night.
How could you be so careless?
If he had read the end, the events which are to follow would ma k e no sense.
Luckily,
I arriv ed in time.
Strange things are happening here, se駉r.
I 'v e seen it with my own eyes,
I even had it in my own hands.
It must be all due to the e vil spirits.
I understand, se駉r, that your mind is rebelling against inexplicable phenomena, but be so kind as to explain in detail.
What are you looking for, se駉r?
There was a book here.
I saw the gallows.
Where has it gone?
Here?
There's never been a book like that here.
Demons again? they are tiring,
I admit.
U nfortunately, the world is full of them.
I ncantations stop their mischief.
Nonsense.
Don't you believe in incantations then?
No.
What if I prove it?
Only if I can perform them my self.
Go on, se駉r.
This is not the place for philosophical disputes.
I am so glad to see you, brother.
When did you get back?
This is Alfonso Van Worden, captain of the guard.
Captain, my sister Rebecca.
Don Pedro Velasquez.
Se駉ra.
I will do my best.
I am glad to con vince you of the power of the supernatural.
Of course.
From Aristotle came the principle that in the mind...
Se駉r Alfonso, I implore you to tell me what you thin k of everything you'v e experienced since arriving here.
I wouldn't know where to start.
I must have been put to sleep with a potion and ta k en to the gallows.
Then you got under the Z ota brothers' gallows?
And found them both hanged?
Do they, byanychance, have the habit of coming down?
Very often, usually at night.
Your hand shows that you are possessed with love for the demons.
Such people have no fear of humans.
I am afraid of nobody.
I am afraid for you.
I am so glad they came.
Gaiety and fun will prevail now.
I am sorry, se駉ra, but I have different plans.
Whatever your decision, you won't refuse to spend a few hours in our compan y.
Your brother is greeting a gypsyso warmly.
A gyps y?
You'll see in a while what a gypsyhe is.
Welcome, Se駉r Alfonso.
How do you know who I am?
Our camp moves from one place to another, and my daughters k eep their eyes and ears open.
An enchanted place.
The people of the Sierra are afraid to go near.
I have no reason to tell them they're wrong.
It is better that most of my retinue was left outside.
Se駉r Av adoro, in this errant life you must have encountered manyunusual adv entures.
I have.
Then tell us, and Se駉r Velasquez will teach us how to experience poetry without the help of ghosts.
I do not succumb to ghosts, but I fear your magic power, se駉ra.
I reck on that from one end of the world to the other, the story of love is always the same.
I thin k you will enjoyhearing about my youthful adv entures.
Some are surprising,
I could even sa y, miraculous.
Whenever I go back to those long gone times of my life,
I hear the noise of avariety of passions and a mix ed roaring of storms.
You seem wiser than others, and I have a delicate problem.
Will you follow me?
I am the lover of a certain young person.
She tends, I thin k, to be fickle.
When you see a woman whose dress suits this, you'll see whether she goes to church, or in another direction.
Here.
You'll get another if you do well.
You're her husband, not her lover.
I 'm pa ying you to discover treason, not who I am.
Sharpen your sight, i漵 time forvespers.
I 'll wait at the inn.
Of lovers.
Of lovers.
What is this?
Your beauty troubled me.
Somebody suspects you of betra ying him.
Follow me.
You will giv e this to Caballero Toledo.
Noble caballero.
My conscience forbids me ta king pa yment from both sides.
What is my fortune?
We'll get married under a big chestnut tree.
Nature will accept ourvows.
The rosyglow of dawn will bless us.
I 'v e lost Caballero Toledo 's address.
He in vited me to a grand feast.
On the other side of the square.
U ntil we meet again.
Ma ybe.
Se駉r Toledo, a lady wanted me to giv e you this little tok en.
I appreciate your wit, my friend, and honor.
Would you like to become one of my serv ants?
Tha漵 impossible,
I was born a nobleman.
I chose the position of beggar as it does not dim a nobleman's jewel.
An answer worth y of a Spaniard!
Le漵 have a drin k.
H uman life is fragile.
Whythese dark thoughts, se駉r?
I am a sinner.
I used to leave one mistress for another, but I concluded that
I was losing too much time that wa y, so I started a new affair before ha ving brok en off the last, and while planning a third.
Spanish women have something... insistent.
I swore love to each.
The punishment for brea king oaths is terrible.
I ndeed, in the other world.
Yesterda y, a friend from Malta visited.
H is name is Aquillar, a noble person and a good Christian.
I cannot understand how, being endowed with such contradictory characters, we have liv ed in such friendship.
Aren't you drin king?
I 'v e nearly finished the bottle.
You haven't touched your glass.
What are you thin king about?
I was thin king of the sun which I saw toda y, whether I would see it again tomorrow.
You doub tless will, if there is no mist.
I maynot liv e to see tomorrow.
Are you planning a duel?
I could act as your witness.
You are the last man
I would as k for this favor.
Good heavens!
You took up your old squabble with my brother?
Shall I lose my friend or my brother in one duel?
I have an ominous feeling... wait until midnight.
If I die, I will come to warn you about the penalties a sinner faces after he dies.
I didn't want to see you, but avoice from heaven ordered me to come.
Were you killed?
I was.
I s there a purgatory in the other world?
There is one.
And tha漵 where I am!
Who died?
Tell me, who died?
Toledo fell unconscious.
I 'm sorry, but my duties are calling me.
At such an interesting point!
Doses of suspense are the sign of a master.
All that has made me confused.
I 'v e lost the feeling of where reality ends, and fantasyta k es over.
You meant to saypoetry.
I do not know what you are aiming at.
I will tell you something that is based on the principles of geometry.
Wanting to define an infinite number,
I write a horizontal eight and divide it byone.
If I want to express infinite smallness,
I write a one and divide it b y the horizontal eight.
All these signs giv e me no idea about what I want to express infinity... greatness...
I n the cosmos, infinite smallness is an infinite root of the smallest part of an atom.
So I am defining infinity, but without comprehending.
Well, if I do not comprehend but I can define it,
I am getting near poetry, which seems to be nearer to life than we suspect.
Empirical science leads to lack of faith.
Only an uneducated man who sees a thing every da y thin k s he understands it.
A true researcher proceeds among riddles.
He errs, but he gets nearer his goal every da y.
Se駉r Av adoro, will you finish Toledo's story?
I remember he was disturbed byavoice from the other world.
Yes.
H is tender soul was very sensitiv e.
So he was in deep despair.
What will you do?
I want to rethin k my life.
Se駉r Caballero, let me ma k e one comment.
Thevoice you heardyesterda y said what you could find in anycatechism.
Do not burden oneself with premature worries.
My friend, he who once heard thevoice of the dead, will surely not spend much more time among the living.
Farewell, my friend.
Tell the lady everything without getting into detail.
I have chosen you as I have a delicate problem.
I would be glad to help, but I am afraid to leave my client.
I can substitute for you, it won't be long.
Listen.
I warn you, he is a prattler and a bore.
You can find something interesting in every story.
You remember the se駉r with whom I dran k wine at your inn?
He is the husband of a young noblewoman.
Discreetly hand this little jewel over to her.
Se駉r Lopez Suarez? like fortune telling, love has its magic.
This tells me you'll see me again soon.
Ma ybe.
You are kind, but the medicine is awful.
I would giv e you a more tasty one, but the medic won't let me.
Sit down.
Sit down, when I tell you to.
I have one soft spot and you will do me a favor.
Ta k e this instrument in your hand... and now listen carefully.
I am the son of Gaspar Suarez, the richest merchant in C 醖iz.
You're wasting time again on romances.
I 'm listening, Daddy.
I漵 time you departed for Madrid.
You have to get to know the world.
Daddy, I want to get married.
First, pass your ex amination in life.
These are the rules you have to follow.
I forbid you to get into discussions with noblemen.
The lords honor us while actually they just want credit, but cannot repa y, understand?
I forbid you to use the title of " Don".
You are Suarez and tha漵 that.
And I also forbid you to use your sword.
The habit brings more discredit than good.
Last but not least, under no circumstances mayyou enter into anyconnections with the house of the ban k er, Moro.
Moro.
And I will reveal to you wh y.
Though I am related to the greatest ban k ers in Spain, seeing how well you are trading with the Philippines,
I will deposit a million with you for a limited partnership.
I am honored.
I 'll try to double your deposit as soon as possible.
You do not need to hurry, se駉r.
Too bad
I didn't hurry.
I am Moro, the royal ban k er, as you know.
My relativ e, Se駉r Liv ardez, has passed awa y.
I n his accounts, there is your cheque for a million.
Will you please return the capital?
I have legally ta k en over his estate.
The million was invested.
It will be doubled in the future, ma ybe even...
I am very sorry.
All right.
Here is your late relativ e's share.
And now listen carefully.
Years later, my ships returned, ha ving tripled the fortune, so I wrote to the ban k er Moro that I had his two million.
My principal receiv ed your letter and begs to inform you that the Liv ardez capital was entered into the book s.
He will not claim anymore.
I owe him two million!
My principal does not even want to hear of it.
This is an insult!
I do not need his generous donation!
He is insulting me!
I began to claim my rights, considering my good name and that of my profession.
I started proceedings.
The tribunal of Se ville pronounced Moro right.
We are to paycourt fees of 600, 000 piastres.
We got no justice.
Sixyears wasted.
And the two million is supposed to be mine?
Tha漵 vile!
You will appeal.
So you see, my son, I have good reasons to forbid you anycontact with the house of the ban k er Moro.
And then?
I said goodbye and, filling my carriage with love stories I had bought in C 醖iz,
I left for Madrid.
Pour me some more of this good mixture, good man.
I feel my strength returning.
These sentimental stories had softened my soul so much that arriving here
I was madly in love, although I didn't know the object of my desire.
Oh, sorry.
Who is that?
Come on in, se駉r.
Se駉r Don Lopez Suarez.
I came to pa y my respects.
I am generally known under the name of... under the name of...
Don Roque Busqueros, a family from Old Castile.
My father has forbidden me to use the title of " Don", and to get involv ed with noblemen.
Senor Don Lopez, my father, in turn, ordered me to giv e the title of " Don" to all prominent merchants, and to seek their compan y.
I also respect my father's will.
Your attitude and the elegance with which you got out of your carriage impressed me.
I s it yours, Don Lopez?
Mine.
Luckycoincidence!
This is what
I passionately collect.
Here, I 'll be glad to oblige.
A real collector always has copies, should one get lost for un known reasons.
And the third could come in handy, when the chance arises.
Don... Roque, I just got out of the carriage.
I am tired and hungry.
Ex actly.
Well, Don Lopez, it isn't becoming that we eat off one plate and use the same spoon and fork.
He y, bo y!
He y, bo y.
Get another set!
Heybo y, get another set!
Busqueros entertained me with gossip from Madrid, while I was impatiently looking forward to getting back to Buen Retiro.
This depopulated park is famous in our romantic stories, and I don't even know what was telling me
I would enter into some tender relationship there.
Se駉ra, I probably found what you are looking for.
I lost my lock et and gold chain.
Was an ything written on it?
You read my name was I nez, and that the original of the portrait is mine.
MayI comment, lovely lady, that the finder usually gets a decent prize?
You're forward for a first meeting.
Congratulations!
You'v e met the son of C 醖iz's richest merchant.
I did not giv e anyreason to have strangers tal k to me.
Lopez Suarez.
Be kind enough to return my lock et.
Begone!
Se駉r Don Lopez,
I 'v e refused twenty in vitations to come and see you.
Well, you have to admit
I did you a favoryesterda y.
Feigning unwittingness,
I told the lady you were the son of one of the richest merchants.
Though she pretended to be angry, it was only to con vince you she was not at all impressed bywealth.
Believe me.
You are young, reasonable and handsome, but remember gold is never an obstacle to love.
How shall we spend the afternoon?
I want to see the town... alone!
You see there was no wa y out of this situation.
Go and sayprayers, then!
It was a lock et from my brother.
Don't as k about an ything else, unless you find something else belonging to me.
Then you'll be able to demand a reward.
We shouldn't be seen together.
Lopez Suarez to...
What?
To I nez.
There is charm in my eyes, comma and you, lady, are the only reason for it.
I would like to put my thoughts in this letter, but they seem... they seem tovanish.
Don Roque, giv e it back!
Where?
Don Roque!
Don Lopez!
Stop, wait!
Well, a letter has to be deliv ered.
You should be grateful to me, se駉r.
Se駉ra.
Whydid you use a man whose impertinence
I already disliked, to bring me your letter?
I wrote that letter for my own pleasure, and that imp stole it.
Ev er since I got to Madrid, he has haunted me like an e vil spirit.
I don't thin k I can be bothered with this nonsense.
And what would you like to know now, se駉r?
Se駉ra, I wish I knew who you were and what your name is.
The daughter of a man who is as rich as your father, the ban k er, Moro.
The curse of my life.
I cannot thin k of you under the threat of my father's curse.
He crossed manyseas to set up as a merchant in C 醖iz.
I n C 醖iz.
Don't believe him and don't lose heart.
Those little heirs are hard to get hook ed, but sooner or later, their turn will come.
You'll scare my dog, meddler!
Now only death is left for me.
Lightning, stri k e me!
Do not be afraid.
I nez loves you more than her life.
Me?
She wants to meet you at the same spot tomorrow at sunset.
I understand that at your age, you don't feel like marriage.
However, I find your ex cuse very strange.
Your father crossed manyseas to set up as a merchant in C 醖iz.
You're luck y,
I 'v e fix ed everything.
Se駉r Don Roque, do one more thing for me:
Do not go to Buen Retiro.
Fair I nez won't be there, but I must sit once more on the same bench and weep over my misfortune.
There's something very offensiv e in your words. they seem to infer some lack of appreciation on your part.
Se駉r.
Jasmine breathes the balmyfragrance, the trees grow greener as you pass under them.
What will happen to a heart which you honor?
I could let you cry in misery alone, but fair I nez maycome, and who will repair your nonsense?
Wha漵 this?
To kill time, I suggest
I tell you a story, in which you will find manyinstructiv e events.
I always had a talent for the law.
I wanted to know people and life.
What is it?
Wha漵 the matter?
Oh, fearsome head!
I thought it was one of my relativ es with whom I was to have an important tal k.
I don't know you or the reason for this unexpected visit.
I had no intention of entering your room.
I just wanted to know who liv es here.
I am a lawy er, studying people's liv es.
Tha漵 different.
Nothing's more pleasant than knowing what people are doing.
Before you wok e up, se駉ra, your husband honored me bythin king my face was a fearsome head.
And she
Se駉r Don Roque, time is passing.
Don Lopez, when a decent man is telling you a fascinating story, you should not interrupt him.
No, no explanations!
This woman
Let me explain everything.
I am the daughter of a brave officer.
My name is Frasquita Salero.
I attracted men, even when
I was a young girl.
Frasquita, Frasquita, be modest!
Be reasonable, Mama!
How can I be bad with such elegant caballeros? haven't you dropped something?
Too bad for me.
If you had dropped that little cross,
I would have pick ed it up and k ept it as a dear souv enir.
Frasquita, get awa y from the window.
U nfortunately, the young man never showed up again.
My beautiful wife.
My sweetness.
Do you love your hubb y?
I do.
And nobody else?
Nobody.
What do you have there, son?
A letter for Se駉ra Frasquita.
Giv e it to me.
I am her father.
Here.
A ring?
What ring?
" I am waiting for you and y earning for you, Pe馻 Flor. "
Frasquita, do you love me?
I do.
Then there are no obstacles to our love.
Perfect, Don Ramino!
If you go on like that with the noble Count Pe馻 Flor, he won't be a nightmare to husbands anymore.
What if I put an end to his conquests?
I 'm afraid of the effects of such a duel.
If I could have
100 doubloons,
I would wait out in the islands.
I 'll gladly offer you 100 for such a noble cause.
The count was murdered last night.
Pe馻 Flor!
From the letter we found on one of the criminals, we know that you offered 100 doubloons for the crime to be carried out.
I have never set eyes on Se駉r Pe馻 Flor.
Yesterda y, two men came with a promissory note for 100 doubloons which I signed ayear ago.
Shall I show you?
No, I am a member of the criminal court, and I am not interested in trade.
That will be all.
Ex cuse us for the inconvenience.
Did you really order this se駉r to be killed?
Whyshould you care?
Do you know him?
I would go on a pilgrimage to St. James of Campostela and even a greater distance, if I believed it could help me.
A wonderful story.
Yes.
Since then, strange things have been happening in the house.
Here are your 100 doubloons back!
Don Diego!
I like it.
Needless to sa y, Count Pe馻 Flor was only made up to upset my husband and ma k e him go on a pilgrimage!
The justice clerk s, as well as the thugs, were all paid off.
Now I understand
"the fearsome head".
And you understand whyI thought you were somebody else.
I haven't finishedyet, se駉r!
Later!
My duties are calling me.
Do you want to offend me, se駉r?
Yes, as there is no other wa y to get rid of you.
Your daddy will surely be glad.
Now.
Where was I?
That same night,
I found my self in entirely different circumstances.
You are luckyonly to be injured, not depriv ed of life.
Eas y, eas y.
I 'v e ta k en things into my own hands.
Things will work out ok ayfor you.
But i漵 too bad you interrupted my story at such an interesting point.
So, listen.
That same night...
I found my self in entirely different circumstances.
Well, and what next?
Se駉r... Don Lopez.
You shouldn't strain yourself, se駉r.
I漵 so long.
Who is it from?
A child, a complete child.
From fair I nez, of course.
I漵 done.
But what is it?
You are supposed to be at her place tonight.
The wedding is tomorrow!
I sn't it enough?
What place?
Moro's house?
Tell me how.
The simple wa y.
But the house is guarded.
The old, well known wa y.
Ta k e it eas y.
I 'll ta k e care of it.
I don't know.
What would you do without me, se駉r?
Which window?
First, second, third.
Which one?
Third!
The window of fair I nez.
My heart is pounding.
I am moved, and please, do not bring anyshame on me.
My gratitude, se駉r, but now we have to use the ultimate means.
When I clap my hands, go up to heaven!
Ready?
Ready!
Well.
Balm breathes.
Jasmine does not.
Oh God!
Did you die?
I did!
I s there purgatory in the other world?
There is one and I am in it!
Was it storm y that night?
Lightning like in hell... it must be whyhe got the wrong window.
Se駉r, I found a purgatorial soul.
Where?
What are you tal king about, man?
Se駉r Toledo.
Listen, se駉r.
So it is the end of my penance.
But how did you find out about it?
Lopez Suarez told me.
The merchant from C 醖iz.
But how did it happen?
Busqueros got the wrong window.
Busqueros?
Ah, Busqueros!
I don't know him, but as k him to come b y.
I 'd like to know more.
What do you thin k?
The lady who gave you a hand k erchief...
I s she still faithful to me?
U ndoub tedly.
Farewell then.
I made up my mind to find that intruder, known all over
Madrid.
Please, don't stop now.
Allow me, se駉ra, to giv e a few moments to this man.
Frasquita told her story to Busqueros, he told it to Lopez Suarez, who in turn told it to
Se駉r Av adoro.
I漵 enough to driv e you craz y.
All these adv entures begin simply.
The listener thin k s i漧l soon be over, but one story creates another, and then another.
Something like quotients which can be divided infinitely.
I 'm a captain of the guard, not a philosopher.
Your math is just dead numbers.
Se駉r, this zero, plus and minus one, gave Archimedes and Newton power equal to the gods.
Very noble men.
But wha漵 the point of it?
We are like blind men lost in the streets of a big city.
The streets lead to a goal, but we often return to the same places to get to where we want to be.
I can see a few little streets here which, as it is now, are going nowhere.
New combinations have to be arranged, then the whole will be clear, because one man cannot invent something that another cannot solv e.
I no longer follow.
Then le漵 k eep listening.
Caballero Toledo regained his former gaiety and balanced soul, and I went to look for that impossible man.
I happened to meet him that same da y.
I like you,
I 'll ta k e you as a serv ant.
Giv e than k s to heaven that unlimited possibilities are opening up to you.
I suppose you haven't met manynoblemen.
I can easily prove that I was brought up as a gentleman.
The fact that I 'm a beggar is down to fate, not birth.
Tha漵 fine.
Le漵 go, se駉r.
At first, your duties won't seem very attractiv e, as you won't be paid or have proper clothes.
As for board...
Are you byanychance the Don Busqueros to whom Lopez Suarez owes so much?
Yes, tha漵 me.
I 'd have ended this whole thing successfully if he hadn't got the wrong window, but le漵 be patient.
Caballero Toledo wishes to get to know you.
Toledo?
I漵 a great honor for me.
I found out that Lopez Senior travelled from C 醖iz, and waited at the house, but ha ving missed his son, went to town.
Where to?
Where can a pro vincial man go?
To see the church.
Wrong, you noble tramp.
To the tavern.
But which one?
The nearest.
But se駉r, what nonsense.
You must admit, C 醖iz is a more important city than Madrid.
Wha漵 more, Suarez, who was short of cash, was trading, than k s to his contacts with Liv ardez.
Moro, in order to retrieve the mone y, had to start a case, which is still unfinished.
Suarez sued Moro to ma k e him accept not a million, but two million from the investment.
The Suarez family is the greatest in Spain and you are an ill informed big mouth.
Than k you for your compan y.
I can see, se駉r, that you're an honest negotiator.
I 'm honored bywhat you'v e said.
I 'm Gaspar Suarez from C醖iz.
My name is Moraredo.
You are heaven sent.
I deduced from your talk that you're a true connoisseur of life.
At your service.
I sent my son here,
I forbade him to use the title
"Don" or frequent nobles.
Very wise.
Or draw a sword.
Understandable.
Just imagine, my Lopez is now
Don Lopez, and the only person he is close to is a nobleman called Busqueros.
U nbelievable.
And he fought him and was thrown out of the window.
I've decided to have him married immediately.
Do you know a young lady from a spotless family?
I do.
What a luckycoincidence.
A reputable merchant also got angry and said he'd closet her in the monastery if she doesn't choose a husband this week.
I 'd love to tal k to her.
You'll meet her toda y.
What in an inn?
A lady from a good family?
I ncognito.
We should hurry.
He's pa ying.
Farewell.
Toda y, more than ever, you'll understand thevalue of my friendship.
You know, Don Lopez, such complex tas k s are my specialty.
From what I gather, you know the merchan漵 life well.
But ex cuse me, Se駉r...
Moraredo.
Your name is not known in merchants' circles.
You know, se駉r...
I presume the situation hasn't allowed you, so far, to try your hand at a business conduciv e to your abilities.
The reason for my beha vior, se駉r, is not impertinence.
I came here only because my father's rage forces me to seek salv ation.
I respect the name of Suarez.
Dear lady,
I 'm honored.
So you intend to marry Se駉rita Moro.
Se駉rita Moro?
Are your intentions not serious?
There's a misunderstanding!
If you can kneel in front of my sister, you're not too old to duel.
Draw or go out the window!
What?
Your honor is at sta k e.
I forbid you to have an ything to do with nobility.
I only got close to the one standing next to you.
You shouldn't have duelled.
Mind, se駉r, you'v e got a sword in your hand too.
Oh, Lopez, whyon earth did you choose Se駉rita Moro?
But you yourself were kneeling at her feet not long ago.
The punishment, Se駉r Gaspar
Suarez, always fits the crime.
If your son ta k es my daughter's hand, it would be an honor.
Although he chose to introduce himself through the window, his actions were undoub tedly due to the grudge over the two million.
I 'll accept it then, pro vided
I can add another two million, and giv e it all to your son, along with my daughter's hand.
You'v e done a good job.
Well done, well done, se駉r.
I漵 not hard to see how i漧l turn out.
Lopez was ta k en to his future father in law's house, and with I nez's care, he'll soon recover.
And now I 'd like to hear more about the other affair.
Was this woman, Frasquita, so charming then?
I told the story you just mentioned to a young gentleman.
Yes,yes, and Lopez Suarez passed it on to my friend, who introduced me to her.
You have an incredible memory, se駉r.
Since you already know
Frasquita's story,
I should tell the story of her husband, and how he got to meet an unfortunate young man.
Go ahead.
That very night,
I found my self in entirely different circumstances.
Who are you?
This sign shows
I 'm in the De vil's power.
Reprobate, stop persecuting me!
Persecute.
What of the doubloons you paid for Count Pe馻 Flor's head?
What do you want of me?
You recognize me?
As you can see, the count, before his death, raised the sta k es.
Don't! Don't!
You'v e giv en us a pleasant hour, se駉r.
You have not disappointed me.
Ex cuse me for telling of things which is a sin in itself, but it is a very instructiv e story.
What happened to
Se駉ra Cornandez?
She became a widow!
Then she married her lover, and ever since, has led a model life.
Here she is!
Well?
But this is Do馻 I scariz.
Frasquita.
What can I do?
I couldn't.
Nor could I! The only wayis
She said
I was her first lover.
There are other women in the world.
Toledo?
Se駉r Toledo!
Run!
Don't panic!
I must thin k it all over again.
More carefully this time.
Se駉r I
Farewell, my friends.
Your sword.
He leads an exhausting life,
I must sa y.
There should be a ladder under every window.
J ust in case.
Wha漵 up?
The officers of the guard are sorting out a problem.
Must have been a dilemma.
There were other reasons too.
I s what you said true?
I never back down.
If I 'm not mista k en, that brave officer was your father.
The chronicles of his duels mention those events.
I n order to avoid an argument, he duelled twice that da y, wounded fiv e in the afternoon and six more in the evening.
He did right, or there'd have been an unnecessary argument!
And this is the end of the story.
You wanted me to tell of my adv entures, and I don't thin k you regret your curiosity.
We must part.
The hour of parting...
I 'm very sorry... also has its sweetness.
I mportant affairs are calling you.
But you said...
I don't thin k, se駉r, you'v e got much time left.
Alfonso Van Worden, we're waiting for you.
Who are you?
My name will tell you nothing.
Welcome to
Gomelez's land.
You must recognize the hermit in me, and thus guess that
I am the Shei k of the Gomelez.
You are here because you have not disappointed us.
Well, I 'm a captain of the guard.
I漵 time for me to reveal our secret.
The Prophet has blessed your love. they will both soon be mothers and continue the family line.
We'v e been to ying with you long enough to ma k e sure that your first night in Venta Quemada will be fruitful for the Gomelez family, as you are the only male heir to ourvanishing line.
Everything you have been through was a planned game, meant to test your honor and courage.
Your men were the ghosts and spirits?
And the Cabalist?
Yes.
So was Pashek o.
He is a Basque acrobat and he lost an eye performing some dangerous acrobatics.
If you sayVelasquez was also involv ed, I won't believe it.
Yes.
This heretic caused us a lot of trouble and we are putting our hopes in Rebecca's hands.
I n this book is everything you saw and experienced.
Ma ybe I can put it all in some order at last.
The rest you can write yourself.
MayAllah send the dew of happiness on your head.
Kiss him, Zibelda.
I will be happyseeing him in your arms.
Whenever I see you, I am always afraid I won't see you again.
Perhaps we won't meet again.
But we want to liv e in your memory forever.
The hour of parting also has its sweetness.
But now I know everything, so tell me really who you are.
Close your eyes.
And when you hear your name, follow us.
Now?
Can we ma k e it before dark?
We can.
This time we can.
For sure.
Where have you been?
The mules have escaped.
Off we go on our wa y.
And hurry!
You must see to him.
A nice room and some peace are the adv antages of our inn.
For a long time, they thought I was missing.
Everybody was overjoyed to see me.
Only the shei k was saddened to see me wea k and my health damaged.
A meal for the se駉r, quick.
Two foreign ladies, who are spending the night at this inn, would like to in vite you for supper.
Wha漵 that?
Where?
The End
Holifart whatastink!
Don't these people ever wash?
The papers say under 11% of Paris apartments have bathrooms.
Okay, but people could wash all the same.
This bunch doesn't make much of an effort.
They're not even
Paris's prize stinkers.
No, they're gathered here by chance.
People at the East Station can't smell worse than those at the Lyons Station.
No reason they should.
Still, what a stench!
Who stinks like that?
That, little lady, is "Bodyguard," a perfume by Fior.
There oughta be a law against fouling the air!
Jeanne!
I'm Zazie. You my unc?
Me in person. I'm your unc.
- You smell funny.
- It's "Bodyguard" by Fior.
- Dab some behind my ears?
- It's for men.
Hi, little bro.
You're sweet to baby-sit.
She's in good hands.
I'll meet you right here day after tomorrow for the 6:60 a.m. train.
NatÃ¼rlich!
How's your wife?
Fine. Come see us?
No time!
When Mom's got a new squeeze, it's so long, family!
Bye, honey! Bye, Gaby!
Bye, Mom!
She's got it bad.
Let's get going.
We taking the metro, Unc?
Whaddya mean?
- I mean no! We got Charlie's hack.
I got a confession stuck in my craw.
It's confessionitis.
I'll say nothing of my youth.
It ain't free, I tell ya!
I'm waiting for my pal.
Here's my pal, Gabriel. See?
Hi there, kid.
What a crummy old heap!
If you don't like it -
- Get in and don't be snotty.
- Snotty, my ass!
Your niece is a hoot.
Oh, damgoddit!
ON STRlKE
Bastards!
To pull this on me!
- It's not just you.
- Don't care!
I was all excited to ride the metro!
Hell and damnation!
- That's life.
- When's the strike over?
- Dunno. I don't do politics.
It ain't politics.
It's about bucks.
- Mister, you ever go on strike?
- Gotta, to get fares hiked.
You oughta pay people to ride in this stinking crate!
Ah, Paris! What a beautiful town!
Look, Zazie!
The Panthéon.
- Come off it!
That's not the Panthéon?
No, that is not the Panthéon!
- Then what?
- Dunno, but it's not the Panthéon.
- We'll ask a passerby.
- They're all morons.
That's for sure.
I got it!
That was the Madeleine.
Maybe, but it's ancient history now.
Now there's a swell piece of architecture!
The lnvalides.
You're way off.
It might be the Gendarmerie.
Say, Unc, when you guys spout crap, you do it on purpose?
All the better to make you laugh, my child.
Truth is, sometimes it's on poipose, sometimes not.
Pull my leg, will ya?
You're two old farts!
- Hear that?
- It's the new wave!
Take your new wave and -
Zazie, if you really wanna see the lnvalides and the true tomb of the real Napoleon, I'll take you.
Napoleon, my ass!
That dumb cluck and his stupid hat!
- Whatcha wanna see, then?
- Yeah, what?
The metro!
There's your metro!
The metro's underground!
Who ya tryin' to kid?
- That's the el.
- Then it's not the metro.
Lemme eggsplain.
Sometimes it comes up, then it re-returns under.
- Bull. You never tell the truth.
- The truth?
As if you knew what truth was.
As if anybody knew.
It's all a lot of hooey.
The Panthéon, the lnvalides, the Gendarmerie, the Madeleine - all a lot of hooey!
What a shame!
A crying shame!
What's that?
Search me. lsn't she a doll?
So, kid, glad to be in Paris?
Well, I never!
Mr. Charles, you're a melancholic.
Melancholic, my ass!
Goddammit to hell!
I won't stand for a little bitch who spouts
"obscelenities" like that!
She'll corrupt the neighborhood!
Yackety-yak!
All you do is yak!
Dinner's ready.
Consommé!
Don't let's exaggerate.
So, child... aren't we tired?
Aren't we sleepy?
Who's we?
You, naturally.
When's bedtime at home?
Home and here are two different things, right?
You just saying yes, or do you mean it?
Hear that, Albertine?
See how kids her age reason?
Why send 'em to school?
I'll go to school till I'm 65.
Sixty-five?
Sure, I'll be a teacher.
Not a bad job.
You get a pension.
Pension, my ass.
It's not for the pension.
Then why do you wanna teach?
To drive those brats nuts.
The ones who'll be my age in 10, 20, 100, 1,000 years!
I'll make their lives hell!
Make 'em eat chalk!
Jab compasses in their rear!
I'll kick their behinds!
I'll wear boots with spurs to tear their butts to shreds!
From what the papers say, the trend in modern education is more towards gentleness... kindness... understanding. lsn't that so, Albertine?
They treat you bad at school?
Just let 'em try!
In 20 years, there won't be teachers anymore.
They'll all be replaced by movies, TV, electronics, stuff like that.
That was in the paper the other day too.
Wasn't it, Albertine?
Yes, it was.
Then I'll be an astronaut.
That's more like it.
I'll drive the Martians nuts!
The kid's got ambition.
- Take me to the Cinemascope?
- Can't. I start work at 11:00.
- I can go with Auntie.
- I say no.
She never goes out without me.
You got soft skin.
She dropped right off to sleep.
But tomorrow -
She'd better not wake me.
Kids get up early, but I need my beauty sleep.
Ten hours minimum is essential.
Yackety-yak!
All you do is yak!
Yackety-yak, my ass!
Wanna repeat that?
I said, "Yackety-yak, my ass!"
What are you insinuating, if I may ask?
I'm insinuating that
I don't like that kid here!
Whether you like it or like it not,
I don't give a crap!
Don't you start talking like your niece!
How can anyone be as unintelligent as you!
Know what "unintelligent" means, you moron?
- Here we go!
- Go where?
You've become real foul-mouthed!
He's starting to get on my nerves.
I won't have a brat like that in my house!
How's that?
I won't have that little bitch in my house!
Can't a body get any sleep?
What's all this mess?
Yackety-yak.
All you do is yak.
It's ruined.
- I'll buy you a new one.
- That's sweet.
But not pigskin.
What would you like? Box calf?
Shagreen?
Russian leather?
Lizard?
Alligator?
That's expensive.
But durable and smart.
See your aunt?
She's kindness itself.
What's he doing here?
He's the landlord.
A great landlord. A real pal.
He's kindness itself.
- Kindness, my ass!
- I heard that "my ass"!
Move it, and no "obscelenities"!
It's not me, it's her!
Tattletale!
You forgot your lipstick.
Hey, kid!
Zazie!
Come back here!
Come back here right this minute!
Where are you off to?
Get down here right now!
I said get down here!
Help! Help!
Don't let that nasty man take me!
I don't even know him!
He said things to me!
- Like what?
The child is a runaway.
I'm taking her home.
Tell me what the naughty man said.
I'm afraid to.
What did he want?
Scum!
What did he want?
That's a new one on me!
Can you believe it?
A real bastard!
I don't get it.
One day my husband wanted me to -
I don't know where he got that idea.
So I says, "If you expect me to... go take a flying -"
Damgoddit!
I just got the fright of my life!
Quit playing the St. Bernard.
Damgoddit!
Well, they didn't kill you.
Damgoddit!
The kid skedaddled.
The kid skedaddled?
- They took me for a lech!
- Scared?
More than during the air raids.
Air raids never scared me.
British bombs weren't meant for me.
I rooted for the Brits.
They didn't scare me either.
No, so they never hit me.
I went out to enjoy the fireworks.
Wham! Bull's-eye!
A munitions dump up in smoke!
- A station blown sky-high!
- A factory in smithereens!
The whole town in flames.
A helluva show!
The good old days.
What is it, little girl?
Somebody hurt you?
Is it that bad?
- Oh, yes, sir!
You poor, poor child.
Tell me what's wrong.
Your parents beat you?
Lose something you'll catch hell for?
Tell me all about it.
You can trust me.
Why should I trust you?
Because I love children.
Little girls and little boys.
You're a dirty old man!
Not at all.
During the occupation, the black market got me nothing but trouble.
I got hit with everything: fines, inspections, requisitions.
Just my luck!
But I inherited this joint.
Then stop whining.
You've got it made.
- What's this?
- The flea market.
This where you buy
"rembrans" cheap, peddle 'em to Yanks and go home loaded?
Not only Rembrandts.
Soles, lavender, nails too.
- And US army surplus?
- Sure.
And good French fries.
Made the same morning.
- I like army surplus.
- They got mussels, too.
That don't make you sick.
- And blew-genes?
- Sure. Compasses too.
- Screw compasses.
I want blew-genes.
Let's go take a look.
You're subtle as a bulldozer.
Got any blue jeans for the kid?
Sure do.
SECONDHAND
I got everything here... from rubber dinghies to fishing rods.
Here's a pair she'll never wear out.
So what?
She'll outgrow them by next year.
- Then her kid sister?
- She's got none.
Next year she might.
Don't joke.
Her poor momma's dead.
If I understand correctly, these are US army surplus blue jeans?
NatÃ¼rlich!
The Yanks had little tykes in their army?
Sure they did.
It takes all kinds to fight a war.
How much are these?
I'll throw 'em in free with the blue jeans.
MUSSELS AND FRlES
Hungry?
Want a bite to eat?
Some mussels? Or fries?
Both.
A glass of white wine. lncredible!
What a slowpoke!
My Pop would've downed ten glasses by now.
- Your Pop drink a lot?
- He did. He's dead.
Were you sad when he died?
No time, with all that was going on.
Like what?
Hey, my mussels!
Remember the dressmaker from Saint-Montron who hit her husband over the head with a hatchet?
Don't you read the papers?
Pathetic! And you wanna have a conversation?
The dressmaker was Mom.
And the husband, naturally, was Pop.
It made a big stink.
Mom hired a hotshot lawyer from Paris.
Someone who don't talk natural.
A real asshole.
But he got her off, easy.
They even gave Mom an ovation.
Almost paraded her through the streets.
Not interested?
- Not particularly.
You're a shifty one.
Don't sulk.
I'll tell you my story.
I'm all ears.
Well, Mom couldn't stomach Pop.
It got Pop down, and he started hitting the bottle.
You following me?
Good. I'm getting there.
It happened last year.
One Sunday in October.
I remember it well.
I was just back from soccer.
Pop was alone in the house.
All alone, waiting.
Not waiting for anything in particular.
Just waiting.
Î—e was all alone, just waiting.
So I come in.
Pop is drunk as a skunk.
He starts kissing me.
Why not? He's my Pop.
It was terrific.
Suddenly, the door opens softly.
You see, Mom had told him,
"I'm going out to buy spaghetti and pork chops."
But it was to trick him.
Smart cookie, eh?
So she slips in, real quiet.
Pop's mind is elsewhere.
And that's how he ended up in heaven!
Still, Mom got off scot-free.
They congratulated her.
Don't that take the cake?
Don't it?
- Oh, sure!
Help! Help!
Don't let the nasty man take me!
- What'd he say?
- Things.
You little thief!
She swiped these blue jeans from my shop.
- Little crook!
- Disgusting!
Didn't she ever learn property is sacred?
What if I take you to the police?
You'll end up in jail!
Sir, have pity on the child.
She's not responsible for the bad upbringing she likely had.
Perhaps hunger drove her to it.
Do not be too hard - not too hard - on her.
Haven't you ever been hungry?
Hungry?
Lady, I was an orphan.
We'll see what your parents say.
Unc, a cop wants to see you.
So you're a cop?
Not on your life.
I'm just a simple peddler.
They call me Pedro Surplus.
Don't believe him.
He's a cop.
The child is joking.
Don't talk without your lawyer.
She thinks I'm dumb.
Kids today!
No respect for their elders.
The crap you have to listen to.
I'd rather leave.
- So you exploit little girls?
- Me, sir?
Yes, you.
She was working the flea market.
Well, I'll be!
What's your line of work?
Entertainer.
The kid said you were a night watchman.
I told the kid a white lie.
What kind of entertainer?
Spanish ballerina.
- So you're a -
- Not at all.
Okay, so I dance in drag in a nightclub. That means nothing.
Strictly for laughs.
With my build, you see -
How do I look, Albertine?
...and hormosessuality, to boot!
What's a hormosessual?
A man who wears blue jeans.
You're spoofing me.
- Take those off.
- No way. They're mine.
Throw him out.
- Suppose he's a cop?
That a reason to be scared?
Love can bloom in a gaze.
Ma'am, we'd like some information on you too.
Like what?
Occupation?
- Housewife.
- Which involves?
Which involves, for instance, throwing out the garbage.
One steak, pronto!
Hello, you!
- Eating with us?
- Wasn't it planned?
Just reminding you.
I didn't forget.
Then I'm confirming my invite.
No need. It was all set.
Okay, hurry up.
23 MlNUTES LATER...
- So what'd this guy say?
- Nothing.
- Is he eating?
- Shoveling it down.
Did he start with the sardines?
Same as you.
- What did he drink?
- Red wine.
- How much?
- He downed half a bottle.
Hey, my plate!
What's on your mind?
I was thinking of Charles.
He's a decent fellow.
He's got a job. A good one.
Taxi driver.
Not too old, not too young.
Healthy. He saves his money.
Not too old, not too young.
Healthy and strong.
Must have a nest egg.
He's got what it takes.
Only thing is, he's too romantic.
Oh, Mr. Charles!
Would you have a shoelace?
I just broke mine.
- I'm out to lunch. Come back at 2:00.
- Aren't those laces?
Hands off, mister!
It's like refusing bread to a starving man.
Don't give me a sob story.
Cop! Lecher!
The thanks I get for returning a child to her folks. And what folks!
Whatcha got against them?
- The uncle is a -
- I forbid you!
Don't tell me what to do.
Gabriel is an upright citizen.
He's well-liked.
A vamp!
You and your haughty airs.
I tell you, Gabriel is -
Prove it.
It's simple. He's married.
That proves nothing.
Henri lll was married too.
- To who?
- Louise de Vaudemont.
If that dame was queen of France, we'd know about her.
Give me the other one.
What are you doing here?
Returning a lost child to her parents.
Now I'm the one who's lost.
The metro's that way.
You don't understand.
It's me I lost.
- I don't get it.
- Just ask me something.
My name, for example.
Okay, what's your name?
I don't know.
- What?
- I never learned it by heart.
Why learn your name by heart?
- What's yours?
- Gridoux.
- See, you learned yours by heart.
- You're right.
Worse - I don't know if I ever even had one.
That can't be!
What do you mean,
"that can't be"?
You know how old you are?
Of course not.
That's awful.
So when people ask me what I do,
I'm not just being difficult.
I get you.
The metro still that way?
That way... or this way.
But the metro's on strike.
On strike!
What a swell town!
I wonder why Paris is always pictured as a dame.
Shpritski nai ekerch!
I didn't know you spoke
Black Forest talk.
I didn't mean to.
It was a sudden stroke of genius.
Us artistes are like that.
Paris will always be Paris! lsn't this gorgeous, Zazie!
The Panthéon.
The lnvalides.
The cabaret.
The metro.
Damgoddit, it makes me dizzy.
It isn't all that high.
But still.
I can see your taxi!
My glasses!
I got a confession stuck in my craw.
It's confessionitis!
I'll say nothing of my youth.
As for my upbringing,
I had none.
Of my education, there's little to tell.
On this score, there's no more to say.
Now I come to my military service on which I won't dwell.
A bachelor from early on,
I am what life has made me.
Rise, descend, descend, rise, come, go - so does Man until he finally vanishes.
A taxi bringeth him.
An elevator taketh him away.
Neither the Tower nor the Panthéon take any note.
All Paris is a dream,
Zazie is a reverie, and all this is a reverie within a dream... a reverie within a dream...
I haven't been up here in 20 years.
How old are you?
How old d'ya think?
You're no spring chicken... 25?
Plus 10.
You don't look too old.
And Uncle Gabriel?
- He's 32.
- He looks older.
Don't tell him or he'll cry.
Why?
'Cause he's a hormosessual?
- Where'd you hear that?
- The guy said that.
- It ain't so.
- No, he really did.
I mean, it ain't so about Gabriel.
What makes him a hormosessual?
'Cause he wears perfume?
You got it.
- That's no crime.
- Of course not.
- Are you a hormosessual?
- I look like a fruit?
- No, you're the driver.
- You see?
See what?
So why aren't you married?
Can't find my dream girl.
You're a snob.
Do you like me?
- You're just a kid.
- Some girls marry at 12.
- Do you like me?
- 'Course not.
- You got screwy ideas.
- Wonder where I get 'em.
And there, way out yonder, the cemetery is piled high with former Parisians... who went up and down countless steps, to and fro along endless streets, until in the end they went and were no more.
Pleasure bringeth them, a hearse taketh them away.
Meanwhile, the Tower rusts, the Panthéon cracks, quicker than their bones rot...
...and melt away in the humus of the woeful metropolis.
But I am alive!
And there my knowledge ceases.
For of the cabbie and my niece,
1 ,000 feet up in the air, and of my sweet spouse,
Albertine, back at the hearth, at this precise moment,
I know only this:
They are almost dead since they are not here.
Created in a flash... animated in a splash... negated in a dash.
Get a move on!
Schnell , schnell!
Well, well!
- Hi, Fedor!
- Gabriel, you here?
What's keeping my Gretchens?
Want a lift to Sainte Chapelle, that jewel of Gothic art?
I'm with Charles.
S'long, Fedor.
Good-bye, my Gretchen ladies.
Hey, answer me!
You wear me out!
What questions!
They're good questions.
You just don't know the answers.
Where were we?
I'm not the marrying kind.
Not all women ask questions like me.
"Women"! You're just a kid.
- I'm developing.
- Don't get dirty.
- Dirty? That's life.
- Life's clean.
You oughta know, in your racket.
Whaddya mean?
I read that cabbies see all types of sessuality.
Cut it out!
That all you can say?
You must be repressed.
Wait for me.
Tell me about your hang-ups.
Scared of women, huh?
There she goes again!
Sessuality all over the place, all the time!
Excrementation! Putrefaction!
People have such one-track minds!
- Where you going?
- I'm splitting.
- What about us?
- Take the metro.
I've had it with that brat.
Unc, I want an ice cream too.
- Where we going?
- I've got a rehearsal at 6:00.
- Take a taxi.
- During a metro strike?
Look at this.
- Why'd Charles take off?
- No reason.
- That's no answer.
- He just did.
- You won't tell me?
- You talk too grown-up for him.
- What if I talk grown-up to you?
- Try me.
Okay. Are you a hormosessual?
Is that too grown-up?
Poor Charles!
Yes or no?
Dearie, you're hurting the poor man.
One mustn't mistreat grown-ups.
He won't answer me.
That's no reason.
We must never resort to violence in human relations.
It is eminently reprehensible.
My ass!
Did I ask you the time of day?
- Leave the child alone.
- Some educator you are!
- Educator, my ass!
What a foul mouth she has!
Mind your own ass!
I have my own ideas on education.
- For instance?
- First, understanding.
You gonna answer my question?
Shit! That wasn't funny.
Be understanding.
Quit making eyes at my uncle.
He's married, you know.
I'm a real young lady, and a widow, on top of it.
My rehearsal!
I'll never make it in time.
- Unc, will you answer me?
- What?
- Is he a hormosessual?
- No doubt about it.
- There's no talking to you!
- That was mean.
You don't educate children by not answering.
She's right.
So you gonna tell me, yes or no?
- What?
- What's a hormosessual?
Damn! To do this to me!
Help!
Kidnappers!
Albertine?
Tired?
No, disappointed.
Officer, a fine gentleman has just been kidnapped!
It's my uncle!
- Who's she?
- Nobody.
I've got a car.
Get the kidnappers!
- She's not so dumb.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
- It's sweet of you.
- You finished?
- Who asked you?
Dames! You asked me!
Words don't make sense!
- You coming or not?
- That's a cop for you!
Judges are even worse.
- Bastards all.
I've seen you somewhere.
- I doubt it.
- Why not?
Maybe the child's right.
- Thank you, my dear.
- A pleasure, my dear.
- Too kind.
- All right, all right.
They're putting me on.
- Come on!
- The kidnappers!
Just look at this.
I don't believe it!
A fine officer like you must know tricks.
Within the limits of the law, of course.
You'll see what stuff
Trouscaillon's made of!
His name's Trouscaillon.
My name is Mrs. Mwack.
Like everyone.
Christ! My rehearsal!
He's terrific!
- He's a clod.
- lsn't he cute?
First it was my uncle.
You want 'em all!
- Is Sainte Chapelle far?
- A jewel of Gothic art.
Of my education, there's little to tell.
Never mind.
Come with us!
This is Captain Fedor Balanovich welcoming you aboard.
We are now cruising over the Trocadéro, famous for its cheeses.
We're flying at an altitude of 5'11".
Speed: six knots.
On your left, the Social Security building, apex of our civilization.
Step on it, Fedor.
I can't take anymore.
I'll take a shortcut.
O madam, could you perhaps have lost your way?
'Tis the wind and the breeze have led us astray.
And here is Sainte Chapelle, a jewel of Gothic art.
Let's move it, gentlemen!
Before it closes.
- He's growing on me.
- She's wacko!
- It's a joy to watch you drive, madam.
- Really?
Hello, Mr. Gabriel!
So there you are!
Rehearsal was at 6:00!
Traffic.
Did my wife bring my new dress?
Your wife?
That's a new one.
Put this call on my tab.
Î—ello, Turandot?
The number you dialed is not in service.
Oh, it's you!
Put Turandot on.
It's Gabriel.
Mado? Go tell Albertine -
I'm all alone.
Throw any customers out!
I can't throw Charles out.
He's proposing to me.
About time! But move it!
So is it yes or no?
This is all so sudden,
Mr. Charles.
I have to think it over.
- So it's no?
- So it's yes.
Gabriel?
Mado Pettifoot and me just got engaged.
Yep, we're marrying.
It won't change nothing, except when we bang away, it'll be legal.
We gotta celebrate.
Come to the club tonight to see my new number.
But tell Albertine to hurry with my dress.
Say, did the kid get back?
Enough is enough!
I'll fire you!
Thanks for ditching me!
Leaving me with that old bag!
Ready?
One, two, three.
You're all flustered.
I just got engaged.
Are you pregnant?
Not yet... but we're getting married anyway.
This calls for a drink.
You mustn't refuse a drop of grenadine.
You sure talk good.
It comes natural.
You've hardly touched it.
It goes to my head.
Oh, I nearly forgot!
Gabriel says to hurry with his dress.
He's invited all of us tonight.
Fire!
My club's on fire!
At their age!
I can't just now, on account of the uniform.
I must be out of my mind.
Aren't we all?
You saw us?
You two make a wild pair.
Not wild to other eyes.
The hell with the "not wilds."
Say, Madame Albertine,
I simply must get dressed.
What should I wear?
You don't look naked to me.
Anyway, it's just us girls.
- You alone?
- Out for a stroll.
A little girl out alone at this time of night!
I'm waiting for the others to go see Uncle dance.
- That elephant dances?
- In a tutu, too!
Mind if I walk with you?
I feel so alone.
Mind if I walk with you?
Do be understanding with grown-ups.
Ah, love! If you only knew.
Some day you'll know love.
You'll see.
More dirty talk? Keep it clean or I'll call another cop.
Heartless child!
Poor old hag.
Still, a cop! Yuck.
He just happened by.
If only your uncle had -
Lay off my uncle.
I told you he's married.
Auntie beats you any day.
Trouscaillon suits me - or he will suit me.
Ah, love!
Can't you change channels?
Then see ya!
For an engagement, a medium white is indispensable, with a touch of virginal silver.
I'll skip the virginal part.
What about that green-and-yellow skirt you wore on Bastille Day?
- You noticed?
You looked exquisite.
That's really sweet.
So you notice me sometimes?
I do.
Because I think you're beautiful.
Do you?
Oh, I do! I really do!
I think you're swell-looking.
You're so well-stacked, and so elegant on top of it.
Don't let's exaggerate.
But you are!
You're real swell.
Why don't we see more of you?
I'd like to see more of you.
Yes, why don't we?
You, the very picture of health, which I dare point out, and so beautiful on top of it.
I'm not one to flaunt it.
Leave it at that, dearie!
Watch this one!
Why did you ask us here tonight?
You who hide behind a veil of ostracism.
You who never wanted our "admirassation" for your art.
We don't understand the hic of this nunc.
So, cabbie, you're engaged?
- I hate parrots!
- See a "psicky-analyst."
I've tried dream analysis.
- What do you dream of?
- Wet nurses.
Something wrong, Mr. Gabriel?
I have stage fright.
Gabriel, you're on!
I have stage fright.
- On account of me?
- Nay, Mr. Pedro.
Why Mr. Pedro?
That was your name this morning.
Really? I forgot.
Aren't you gonna ask me why I'm here?
No, I'm not.
That's really disgusting.
Well, I have some questions for you.
Ask away, but I won't answer.
You have to.
I'm lnspector Bertin-Poirée.
My card.
A fake, obviously.
Never seen gangster movies?
I could have you busted.
No search warrant, violation of privacy.
- And violation of something else?
- Excuse me?
I got you under my skin.
The minute I saw you,
I knew I had to bang you into bed.
Better sooner than later.
I can't wait.
I'm the impatient sort.
I've got it bad.
You must be joking.
Admit you're a phony cop.
And you think a cop can't fall in love?
See my daisy?
- Then you're a real jerk.
- Some cops can't cut it.
But my personal charm won't leave you -
My personal charm won't leave you cold.
Tell me another one!
My sex appeal.
A few words and my sex appeal will go to work.
And if it doesn't?
Then I'll jump you, just like that!
Earlier, it was Zazie.
But a real dish like you -
- Not with the others?
- They bore me.
I'll go get your bag.
I'm the fickle type.
This morning it was the kid from the sticks.
At noon, you, baby-doll.
After lunch, it was that society broad, the Baroness Mwack, a widow.
In less than five minutes, her life was turned upside-down.
You must think me a snob, my lovely.
Still not under my spell, my divine Albertine?
Getting dresseded?
- "Dresseded"? You mean "clothed."
- You can't fool me.
Check the dictionary.
An egghead, too! Let's see.
"Dreck, dredge, dregs..."
All household words.
Here it is: "dress"!
"I dress, I dressed, I am dressed."
She was right!
"Undo, undreamed, undress..."
Opposite of "dress"!
So undress, my lovely!
Take it off, take it all off!
There's nothing in town to top Gabriel's number.
But he's in a rut.
Entertainers are like that.
Once they find a gimmick, they stick to it.
But don't we all?
Not me.
I keep changing mine.
Because your act's no good.
You keep trying stuff.
So far nothing's worked.
You look like a flop.
- Even in uniform?
- That doesn't help.
It's the lech!
Recognize him?
This calls for an explanation!
- Where's the mustache?
- I left it at home.
- Leave him alone!
- Disturbing the peace!
- Moonlight rowdiness!
Mezzanoche madness!
Look again. I'm a cop.
See my wings?
- Where's Albertine?
- Vanished!
Onward to some onion soup!
I hereby proclaim and declare, my dear Gabriel, before all present, that you are the greatest dancer in town.
And here's to you!
Cheer up.
An old hag like you is sure to find another sucker.
Onion soup, Muscadet wine -
This is the life.
Dinner with friends, sincerity, purity.
Not eating your soup, Zazie?
Let her sleep. Let her dream.
That old crock still here?
Pity the unfortunate.
Right, old witch?
You're so kind.
Unlike her.
Children are so heartless.
How long's she gonna bug us?
The old wreck has a broken heart.
You ladies don't like
Alsatian sauerkraut?
No, they don't!
Who gafe zeez foreigners ze right to talk kooking?
- You know what that costs?
- I sure do. I'm in the trade.
The old hag's guzzling all the wine.
This stuff isn't bad.
She has no class.
She'd never try that with me.
People are all jerks. lncluding you.
Is it the price?
It's fair enough!
If it weren't for the taxes!
Don't push!
A spoonful for the parrot!
And for Mado!
Revenge!
Kill the cops!
But God is dead!
What?
Never say die!
Yes, it is I,
Haroun el Arachis, prince of this world... whom you have known yet little recognized.
Trouscaillon! My king!
What a shame!
And me with a private income!
Crooked arm of the law, nocturnaut shyster, tormentor of widows and orphans,
I take pleasure in donning the mask of confusion and error.
Go home to bed.
I'll take her to the train.
The strike's over!
And he's so stupid too.
If he insists, I may not refuse, but I won't chase after him anymore.
Good-bye, sir.
Did you have a good time?
So-so.
Did you ride the metro?
Then what did you do?
I got older.

{4186}{4279}That's right. You're the only outsider here.
{4282}{4307}But...
{4340}{4445}We shouldn't have let you record our messages.

{9458}{9632}Princess Maas Doulina Salno, |is coming to Japan unofficially.
{9680}{9745}I want you to be her bodyguard.
{9786}{9815}Me?
{9837}{9956}It's an unofficial visit. They don't want any protocol.
{9967}{10065}What's she here for? Sightseeing?
{10080}{10219}According to our sources, there is a plot to assassinate her.
{10224}{10296}She's the heir to the throne.
{10309}{10403}That's why she's leaving Selgina.
{10429}{10537}Sounds like a big job. When is she arriving?
{10544}{10601}Her plane's already left.
{10626}{10660}Already?
{10684}{10726}That's her.
{11556}{11658}- Has the princess left?|- Yes sir.
{11663}{11698}The device?
{11699}{11833}Carefully planted. She'll never come back alive.
{11853}{11886}Good work.
{12376}{12476}What are you looking at, your highness?
{12548}{12629}I feel as if I can reach the stars.
{12657}{12721}You should go to bed now.
{12732}{12877}Not yet. I want something to drink first.
{13195}{13307}Standup. Leave this place.
{13338}{13412}You must leave now.
{13470}{13514}Escape.
{13592}{13631}Escape.
{13714}{13748}Escape!
{13936}{13968}Your highness!
{15464}{15649}Kurobe Dam. The terminal.
{15978}{16067}Professor Murai from the Geological Institute?
{16073}{16119}Yes, how do you do?
{16122}{16177}Welcome. We've had many shooting stars lately.
{16205}{16340}The one last night was enormous.
{16357}{16480}It fell over Mount Kurodake at a 60-degree angle.
{16484}{16640}Never seen anything so bright.|Lucky it didn't hit the dam.
{16700}{16785}- Where did it fall?|- Here.
{16810}{16887}- Around Kasumizawa?|- That's right.
{16890}{17032}The air currents are bad here.|Helicopters can't fly to the valley.
{17070}{17222}The only way is over the bridge and|through the mountain trail.
{18399}{18440}There it is.
{18717}{18763}What is it?
{18777}{18869}It's supposed to point to the south-east.
{18874}{18940}That's because the sun is there.
{18941}{19000}My compass points north.
{19004}{19054}Must be a cheap compass.
{19116}{19180}What? Mine is the same.
{19188}{19252}What does it mean?
{19786}{19852}Professor, there it is!
{20949}{21017}It's so impressive!
{21353}{21405}Let's camp here.
{21410}{21447}Unload your rucksacks.
{21710}{21765}We can get water there.
{22148}{22216}When is the princess arriving?
{22232}{22270}Forget it.
{22276}{22315}Why's that?
{22324}{22411}Her plane exploded in mid-air.
{22439}{22530}Exploded? Was it the work of the assassins?
{22537}{22568}We don't know.
{22576}{22626}Any clues?
{22629}{22740}Not even the Foreign Ministry has any clues.
{22896}{23024}It's tragic that she should become the|victim of a power struggle isn't it.
{23042}{23072}Here.
{23141}{23320}"But you must admit some strange|things have occured lately."
{23494}{23530}Hey, Naoko!
{23555}{23608}- Hot news!|- Hot news?
{23614}{23649}A prophet has appeared.
{23649}{23685}- A prophet?|- Right.
{23691}{23799}Great stuff for 'Myths Of|The 20th Century'. Go now!
{23810}{23945}Here. Take these two tapes to Central Park.
{23992}{24037}Everyone!
{24049}{24187}Everyone! Have you ever thought|about the expanding universe?
{24217}{24459}The time has come for all Earth people to awaken|to their duties as citizens of the universe.
{24467}{24533}Are you a boy or a girl?
{24538}{24593}Do a striptease!
{24733}{24806}She suffers from megalomania.
{24812}{24933}No wonder. We're having a heatwave|instead of snow this winter.
{24949}{25079}The Earth is on the brink of destruction.
{25108}{25264}But you still refuse to take me seriously.
{25272}{25302}Listen to me!
{25480}{25543}Where are you from?
{25680}{25790}Space? Aren't you Japanese?
{25831}{25902}I come from Jupiter.
{25957}{26030}Is Jupiter in Africa?
{26066}{26117}Jupiter is up in the sky.
{26178}{26213}Are you?
{26216}{26342}So one can travel in space now? We should go.
{26416}{26542}You were talking about the destruction of the Earth.
{26607}{26730}First, a diaster will occur at Mount Aso.
{27479}{27636}I don't think Mt. Aso has suddenly|become more active.
{27650}{27721}Nothing will happen there.
{27757}{27988}Whether she's from Jupiter or not, her|predictions are totally unfounded.
{28414}{28471}Thanks.
{28512}{28562}Thank you very much.
{29209}{29227}I'm back.
{29238}{29323}Welcome. Naoko's just home.
{29337}{29404}I think she has a new boyfriend.
{29407}{29440}You think so?
{29441}{29495}No, it's just a hunch.
{29499}{29560}That's alright then.
{29621}{29689}Welcome home. You're home early.
{29695}{29770}- I saw something very interesting.|- What?
{29775}{29872}Girl falling for a man with a nice car. Who is he?
{29890}{30016}Oh, him! Don't be so rude about Professor Murai.
{30032}{30118}Is Professor Murai your boyfriend?
{30177}{30297}No way. He's a professor at the university.
{30303}{30334}That's nice.
{30396}{30547}Mother, Professor Murai has been to the mountains.
{30555}{30701}He's investigating the meteorite. He told me about it.
{30712}{30830}It's a very strange meteorite. Look.
{30839}{30916}'Myths Of The 20th Century' again?
{30937}{31029}You're always talking about work.
{31063}{31196}I need to get lots of stories|before the programme starts.
{31340}{31405}Turn to Channel 7.
{31407}{31430}The news.
{31433}{31560}It's mothers favourite programme.|It's for housewives, but funny.
{31586}{31601}Hey!
{31610}{31693}Keep mother happy.
{31718}{31792}"We present 'What Are They Doing Now?'"
{32035}{32159}Ladies and gentlemen, welcome|to 'What Are They Doing Now?".
{32166}{32208}The programme which...
{32212}{32464}...give the public the opportunity to meet|the celebrities who have caused a stir in the past.
{32469}{32516}Now to make their request...
{32516}{32558}Here are our first guests.
{32612}{32720}A couple of nice little boys. Come here.
{32851}{32882}How old are you?
{32887}{32918}Five.
{32923}{33031}How cute! He's the same height as you.
{33052}{33094}Cut it out.
{33114}{33219}Now, who would you like to see again?
{33225}{33254}Mothra!
{33393}{33493}Now that's a surprise! Not easy to arrange.
{33496}{33522}Impossible?
{33530}{33626}No... but Mothra...
{33630}{33660}Liar!
{33728}{33793}I never tell lies.
{33795}{33839}Why not call the fairies?
{33848}{34012}They live with Mothra on Infant Island. Here they are!
{34786}{34961}I believe you all know these pretty little fairies.
{34967}{35067}They live with Mothra on Infant Island.
{35082}{35202}Good evening everyone.|Good evening, boys.
{35207}{35244}Good evening.
{35253}{35362}You wanted to ask about Mothra. Go ahead.
{35369}{35400}Big sisters.
{35402}{35454}Yes, what is it?
{35468}{35526}How are the Mothras?
{35532}{35628}Thank you. However, one of them is dead.
{35635}{35693}And the other?
{35697}{35857}He's fine. He's still a baby, but keeps peace on the island.
{35864}{35918}Would you like to see him?
{35956}{36033}Then we'll sing his song.
{36039}{36173}Shut your eyes and you'll see Mothra.
{36180}{36236}Shut your eyes.
{40131}{40209}This would make a good story. Don't you think?
{40228}{40272}Not interested.
{40279}{40405}Big brother, you must have a dream, otherwise...
{40413}{40474}He thinks everyone is a thief.
{40543}{40593}Leave her alone.
{40610}{40717}Think about your age. You're behaving like children.
{40862}{40920}"PROPHET PREDICTS DIASTER"
{41289}{41325}You sent for me, sir?
{41385}{41426}Look at this.
{41586}{41761}Latest news from Japan. Are you|sure the princess' plane was destroyed?
{41790}{41850}I'm positive. I swear.
{41858}{41938}Then why is she in the paper?
{41991}{42041}This is impossible.
{42083}{42186}This girl is not wearing the royal bracelet.
{42254}{42352}It could be anyone in this picture.
{42355}{42490}Go to Japan immediately and find out.
{42497}{42600}I will. And if she is the princess?
{42604}{42656}Kill her of course.
{42705}{42815}And if you fail, you'll be killed.
{42867}{42889}Go!
{42921}{43094}We've decided to make a|programme about this Jupiter girl.
{43104}{43244}Especially her predictions for the future.
{43256}{43355}That should make an interesting programme.
{43381}{43469}Does that mean the previous stories|will be shelved?
{43477}{43526}I didn't mean that.
{43535}{43628}But we'll start the series with|the girl from Jupiter.
{43641}{43723}But, we don't know where she is.
{43729}{43851}Then go and find her. You have eyes and legs.
{43878}{43931}What do you think?
{44024}{44133}I think it should be an exclusive.
{44139}{44170}That's right.
{44233}{44371}She always appears among the|crowds. Look for her there.
{44438}{44495}She looks very similar.
{44505}{44749}But, the ambassador said the Princess of Selgina|wears a bracelet on her arm.
{44763}{44882}Maybe that's why she's in disguise|and says such silly things.
{44891}{44976}To hide from the assassins.
{45031}{45064}We must protect her.
{45076}{45245}We don't have the authority.|Legally, we can't do anything.
{45267}{45396}Chief, let me do it. I can't|stand this situation.
{45427}{45516}OK, but you'll have to do it alone.
{45703}{45812}I'm in Shibuya. Haven't seen her yet.
{45817}{45902}No sign of her anywhere else?
{45919}{46030}OK, I'll call you later. Bye.
{46086}{46157}Brother! Are you loafing?
{46171}{46208}I'm not like you.
{46213}{46272}Why, I'm pursuing someone.
{46276}{46358}That's not very ladylike.|Want to get a drink?
{46362}{46461}OK. I'm waiting for someone.
{46691}{46719}Not here yet?
{46723}{46859}No. You have ten minutes. Then pay and buzz off.
{46867}{46914}I'm not paying.
{46944}{46991}Sorry, I was talking to her.
{47002}{47039}What will you have?
{47043}{47065}Blue Mountain.
{47073}{47105}Blue Mountain, please.
{47159}{47202}Who are you pursuing?
{47206}{47301}I can't reveal our plan...|not even to my brother.
{47329}{47374}Sorry I'm late.
{47431}{47464}May I sit down?
{47470}{47542}Please! This is my brother.
{47546}{47601}I'm Professor Murai, Geological Institute.
{47607}{47635}Nice to meet you.
{47650}{47755}My brother thinks you're my boyfriend.
{47755}{47796}Oi, shut up!
{47806}{47839}My pleasure.
{47842}{47906}You look like you're on duty.
{47912}{47980}I'm going to the mountain again.
{47989}{48042}To investigate the meteorite?
{48050}{48089}Did you find anything?
{48098}{48193}We've discovered it has a strange attraction.
{48206}{48307}A kind of magnetism or gravity.
{48319}{48373}Just right for 'Myths Of The 20th Century'.
{48381}{48402}Blue Mountain.
{48425}{48514}More interesting than the girl from Jupiter.
{48526}{48733}"The prophet from Jupiter appeared|yesterday on the crater of Mount Aso..."
{48738}{48811}"...warning sightseers to stay away."
{49134}{49230}Everyone, please listen to me.
{49239}{49479}Leave the volcano immediately. You are not aware|of the danger your are in. Please leave.
{49483}{49531}Is it going to erupt?
{49540}{49610}I'm not talking about eruption.
{49626}{49764}Inside the crater, Rodan is reviving.
{49826}{49890}I'm scared. Let's go home.
{49899}{50012}Don't listen to her, she's crazy.|I'm here with you.
{50291}{50333}You've lost it now.
{50339}{50430}I gave it to you. I don't want you to lose it.
{50447}{50515}I can't go down there.
{50541}{50689}I'll get it for you! 700 Yen!
{50747}{50792}No, 500 Yen.
{50821}{50891}All right, how about 200?
{50933}{50960}It's a deal.
{50964}{50989}Good.
{51210}{51293}Stop! Come back here!
{51346}{51431}Shut up, crackpot! You'll ruin my business.
{51496}{51528}Come back here!
{52403}{52443}Help me!
{52462}{52497}Help me!
{55694}{55758}Nobody knows we're here?
{55763}{55843}No. I've reserved a quiet hotel.
{55845}{55977}Good. Where is the princess?|No, I mean the prophet.
{55988}{56102}She's been missing since Rodan revived.|But she'll be back.
{56113}{56172}Are the police looking for her?
{56178}{56273}They're too busy to bother with her.
{56315}{56438}"Police have evacuated the area around Mount Aso."
{56445}{56550}"All climbers and sightseers must stay away."
{56575}{56772}"Police are also warning that the|meteorite in Kasumizawa might explode."
{56780}{56909}"Only the research party are allowed on the mountain."
{56917}{56985}"The public must stay away."
{57032}{57060}I'm going.
{57073}{57100}Wait a minute.
{57125}{57219}Professor, the light is getting brighter.
{57226}{57330}How strange. There is no magnetism today.
{57567}{57645}We shouldn't ignore the signs.
{57660}{57720}We should get out of here.
{57723}{57818}This is our only opportunity.
{57864}{57960}Aren't you interested in extra-terrestrial objects?
{57966}{58103}Of course. But my interest is losing out to my fear.
{58110}{58220}Professor, it seems to be growing.
{58228}{58306}Meteorites don't inflate like a balloon.
{58314}{58358}Let's investigate.
{58685}{58770}Anything to say before you leave?
{58781}{58899}We thank you all. We're going back to Infant Island.
{58918}{58999}If we call you again, will you come?
{59015}{59066}With pleasure.
{59075}{59189}But, we wish you'd receive us without a fanfare.
{59195}{59264}What do you think about Rodan?
{59266}{59352}Can you tell us where he is?
{59420}{59536}Our telepathic powers can't prophesy.
{59559}{59637}But Rodan will appear again soon.
{59801}{59857}Everybody, goodbye.
{59865}{59923}This ship must not sail.
{59968}{60016}It must not sail.
{60029}{60064}The girl from Jupiter!
{60125}{60196}Captain, the prophet is on board.
{60200}{60284}What? I didn't give authorisation.
{60289}{60331}She says not to sail.
{60336}{60413}I give the orders. Get rid of her.
{60430}{60585}Why can't you understand?|This ship must not sail.
{60596}{60639}Come with me.
{60646}{60684}Who are you?
{60689}{60729}A friend.
{60734}{60797}Excuse me, let me through.
{60811}{60857}Get off the ship.
{60858}{60973}Wait, I'll take her with me.
{60977}{61034}Naoko, wait!
{61206}{61259}Chief, I've found it!
{61266}{61310}She's the princess.
{61314}{61333}What?
{61633}{61673}How did you get it?
{61683}{61729}A man was trying to sell it.
{62215}{62255}Where did you get this?
{62267}{62415}I didn't steal it. I'm an honest fisherman.
{62437}{62515}I just want to know how you go it?
{62517}{62658}I swapped it for my cap, jumper and trousers.
{62692}{62725}Where?
{62743}{62810}At sea, that's the truth.
{62825}{62853}At sea?
{62861}{63019}On my way back from fishing,|I found a girl adrift.
{63023}{63177}I only wanted to help her, that's the honest truth.
{63185}{63224}Didn't you suspect her?
{63238}{63490}I meant to take her to the police as soon as we|got into harbour, but she was already gone by then.
{63632}{63715}Which is the one with the bracelet?
{63909}{63965}That's my cap!
{63974}{64079}She's the one I met at sea. That one too.
{64195}{64264}You'll stay here. Take him.
{64281}{64326}I didn't steal it.
{64331}{64422}We just need a statement.
{64606}{64665}Chief, What do you think?
{64734}{64860}Well, she was in the plane that exploded in mid-air.
{64879}{64960}How could she survive?
{64970}{65014}You don't believe it?
{65023}{65101}Children don't either. What about you?
{65107}{65244}I don't know. I've asked a lot of people, no one believe it.
{65261}{65347}But the UFO society's chairman said something interesting.
{65402}{65567}She was saved because she fell|in the gap between the dimensions.
{65579}{65841}You may not be aware of it, but there's|a world of dimensions different from ours.
{65865}{65983}The big explosion created a gap between the two worlds.
{65992}{66056}She fell into the gap and survived.
{66491}{66594}I'm from Toyo TV. Is the usual room available?
{66604}{66720}Sorry, miss. Maybe the one across the corridor?
{66735}{66819}Room 384? All right.
{66873}{66936}Are you reporting on vagrants this time?
{67848}{67881}That's her.
{67928}{67956}Isn't it?
{67964}{68055}Not sure. It looks like her.
{68062}{68120}- Let's do it.|- Wait.
{68133}{68249}She saw me, but didn't react. Maybe it's not her.
{68264}{68352}Can I speak to the editor?
{68378}{68399}It's Naoko.
{68427}{68586}I'm here with the Jupiter girl.|Yes, we're in the hotel.
{68606}{68677}That's OK. Can you do me a favour?
{68681}{68852}Will you bring her some clothes? OK. Bye.
{68920}{68976}You should relax tonight.
{68999}{69055}There's someone in the room.
{69115}{69217}There's no one. We're here alone.
{69500}{69529}Good evening.
{69538}{69589}Weren't you aboard the ship?
{69619}{69645}What's wrong?
{69660}{69753}We understood what she meant.
{69762}{69800}What was that?
{69804}{69861}Don't go aboard that ship.
{69978}{70055}Please tell me, why not?
{70187}{70265}What's wrong with that ship?
{70287}{70329}It's too late.
{71844}{71927}Professor, that must be a monster.
{72002}{72089}It's grown another 0.8m since the other day.
{72099}{72199}How odd. Meteorites down grow.
{72205}{72316}But this one does. How is the magnetism?
{72321}{72411}No reaction at all. It's dead.
{72445}{72560}We should leave. It's getting too big.
{72662}{72741}Hey! It's starting again.
{73342}{73393}It fits you nicely.
{73536}{73578}Where are you going?
{73584}{73739}My duty is to warn people about|the danger the Earth is in.
{73745}{73915}Wait! You can tell everyone in|Japan without leaving this room.
{74326}{74484}Hello. Oh no, don't send him up. I'll come down.
{74564}{74644}Wait a minute. Stay here.
{75381}{75421}What do you want brother?
{75477}{75600}Don't pretend. I know you've got the princess.
{75616}{75709}Princess? What you're talking about.
{75712}{75740}Princess.
{75849}{75901}It's been a long time.
{76067}{76121}I am from Jupiter.
{76147}{76274}Nonsense. You're the Princess of Selgina.
{76287}{76338}I've never heard of her.
{76356}{76497}First of all, you must leave here at once.
{76534}{76631}Don't listen to her. Why don't we kill her?
{76636}{76671}Wait!
{76676}{76731}We're not in Selgina anymore.
{76758}{76865}If she's forgotten, I'll remind her.
{77243}{77289}See this dagger?
{77315}{77404}I killed your father with it.
{77410}{77518}Brother, give me back the key. Don't do that!
{77520}{77678}How many times do I have to tell you?|That girl is the princess.
{77682}{77769}I know she's with you. Give me the key!
{77794}{77893}Stop it, or I'll call the police!
{77924}{78006}Stupid! I am the police.
{78021}{78090}I could have you arrested.
{78096}{78190}No. What will you do to the princess?
{78194}{78242}Protect her of course.
{78250}{78359}Then send her back when she comes to her senses.
{78376}{78452}Alright. Come on up.
{78513}{78639}Princess, what did you do with the bracelet?
{78662}{78696}Bracelet?
{78702}{78741}Yes.
{78781}{78948}You wore the royal bracelet on your right arm.
{79014}{79131}Yes! On your right arm, remember?
{79162}{79277}I am from Jupiter. And yet...
{79284}{79349}And yet?
{79398}{79436}What?
{79461}{79546}I may have worn a bracelet.
{79567}{79630}Where is it now?
{79640}{79791}Those things are worthless.|Why can't humans realise this?
{79798}{79854}Where is the bracelet?
{79896}{79981}I gave it to a poor fisherman.
{80319}{80421}What's happened? Turn on the light!
{80477}{80539}Watch out! The killers!
{80837}{80895}Naoko! Hit the alarm!
{81687}{81748}Naoko, turn on the light.
{81847}{81949}Little fairies! Thank you.
{82092}{82134}Princess!
{82359}{82581}'The Symptoms Of Chronic|Amnesia And Delusions'?
{82590}{82722}What's she doing?|You can read in the dark?
{82735}{82807}I am from Jupiter.
{82813}{82894}Let's go. It's too dangerous in town.
{82897}{82920}Where to?
{82928}{83021}I've asked a doctor to examine her.|Come on, quick.
{83502}{83542}It's Godzilla!
{88033}{88105}Where are we going, brother?
{88111}{88162}Doctor Tsukamoto's laboratory.
{88170}{88201}A laboratory?
{88212}{88324}He's an expert in psychology.
{88342}{88407}He often helps the police.
{88681}{88725}Fifteen.
{88927}{88960}Twenty.
{89138}{89177}Good.
{89481}{89558}Doctor, can she be cured?
{89569}{89602}Cured?
{89613}{89819}There's nothing wrong with her.|She's perfectly normal.
{89901}{90012}Doctor, then why does she|say she's from Jupiter?
{90015}{90091}Is she really an alien?
{90134}{90255}I doubt it. I'll make her tell us what she is.
{90286}{90424}I have a new treatment,|a kind of sleeping drug.
{90462}{90491}Look.
{90520}{90601}Why can't you understand?
{90606}{90702}The Earth will perish if we don't act.
{90707}{90806}King Ghidorah will turn it into a dead star.
{90834}{90890}King Ghidorah?
{90895}{91114}One hundred years ago, a monster|destroyed Jupiter's culture and science.
{91129}{91312}Jupiter had once progressed far ahead of Earth.
{91323}{91525}But, because of the space monster|King Ghidorah, it is a dead planet.
{91598}{91680}Will King Ghidorah come to Earth?
{91684}{91783}Yes. He already has.
{91855}{91968}The Earth is coming to an end.
{92040}{92095}You don't believe me?
{92205}{92278}I can see it in your eyes.
{92321}{92415}I feel as if we are the ones being examined.
{92423}{92496}Doctor, you must do something.
{92516}{92616}Right, lie down. Go to sleep.
{92656}{92874}"Attention! Godzilla and Rodan are|moving from Hakone to Mount Fuji."
{92883}{92978}"Get ready to evacuate at once."
{94170}{94230}Hey, get up!
{94366}{94427}Professor, look!
{94501}{94541}Follow me.
{95091}{95180}Professor! Quick! Quick!
{96945}{97012}Look! It's taking shape!
{97382}{97577}"Attention! The monster discovered last night|has been identified as King Ghidorah."
{97584}{97720}"This is an emergency! All citizens|must leave the area!"
{99600}{99903}Gentlemen, Professor Murai has told us how|the space monster King Ghidorah appeared.
{99945}{100050}We had Godzilla and Rodan.
{100054}{100157}And now we have, King Ghidorah!
{100168}{100352}"How will the government deal with this crisis?|The people want to know!"
{100397}{100465}"I call upon the Defence Minister..."
{100468}{100569}...to give us a responsible answer.
{100601}{100639}General Wado.
{100764}{100941}All National Guard units have been put on the alert.
{100961}{101103}They'll be watching the movements|of Godzilla and Rodan.
{101110}{101370}As for King Ghidorah... we're in contact|with the international allied forces.
{101380}{101462}We're doing our best...
{101471}{101582}"...to destroy this monster as soon as possible."
{101586}{101649}We don't want excuses.
{101653}{101774}We want to know how you'll destroy them!
{101775}{101815}General Wando.
{101886}{102002}This is not just our country's problem.
{102017}{102098}The entire world is watching us.
{102134}{102354}Do we have the courage to use atomic|weapons against Godzilla and Rodan?
{102402}{102516}I don't have to explain any more.
{102527}{102682}We can only do our best|and prepare for death.
{102686}{102748}"FUJI NATURAL SCIENCE GARDEN"
{104378}{104508}Gentlemen, I've taken the liberty of|of bringing some people here.
{104519}{104625}As the general said, we need help.
{104630}{104704}Will you listen to them?
{104722}{104752}By all means.
{105197}{105251}Oh, it's that girl!
{105274}{105393}This is Miss Naoko Shindo from Toyo TV.
{105405}{105527}And these are the fairies from Infant Island.
{105663}{105767}I thought you'd returned to the island?
{105776}{105862}No. We're with the prophet now.
{105866}{105908}The prophet?
{105926}{106046}Ah, the girl from Jupiter.|Where is she now?
{106069}{106145}Dr. Tsukamoto's laboratory at Mt. Fuji.
{106159}{106204}Let's go and find her.
{106228}{106366}As you know, Mothra and Godzilla fought once.
{106373}{106673}It may sound primitive and unscientific, but through|the fairies, we could ask Mothra to help.
{106699}{106772}Would you ask her, girls?
{106889}{106926}What is it?
{107006}{107133}We're afraid not even Mothra can|beat King Ghidorah.
{107154}{107283}You mean Mothra can't defend|Infant Island against King Ghidorah?
{107296}{107444}No, that's the problem. But...
{107443}{107533}But? But what?
{107542}{107597}There is a way.
{107600}{107664}How? Tell us.
{107676}{107787}For Godzilla, Rodan and|Mothra to co-operate.
{107873}{108012}If they unite, they may be able|to overcome King Ghidorah.
{108072}{108175}But, who'll persuade Godzilla|and Rodan to co-operate?
{108186}{108282}Mothra might. We'll ask her to.
{108364}{108526}But, if Godzilla and Rodan refuse,|it will be the end.
{110335}{110498}We don't have much time! Call|Mothra immediately, we beg you!
{110508}{110559}Please, call her now!
{115341}{115421}Doctor, is she in a coma?
{115496}{115546}Draw the curtains.
{115581}{115668}All of you, get ready to evacuate.
{115919}{116096}Now, maybe we'll find out who she really is.
{116178}{116304}You're sleeping, but your brain is awake.
{116401}{116487}Tell us who you are.
{116518}{116609}I come from Jupiter.
{116734}{116786}Is that so?
{116790}{116955}But, people from Jupiter|don't live on the Earth.
{116971}{117014}How did you get here?
{117028}{117229}I'm one of the people who escaped Jupiter|on the last day of the planet.
{117250}{117281}When was that?
{117289}{117344}Five thousand years ago.
{117348}{117470}Five thousand years ago?|How could you live so long?
{117473}{117573}Of course I couldn't.
{117606}{117856}When our ancestors reached the Earth,|they integrated with Earth people.
{117873}{118105}Our excellent talents degenerated and|we inherited only some of their instincts.
{118117}{118156}What instincts?
{118162}{118253}To foresee the future.
{118296}{118338}Doctor!
{118648}{118751}Do you believe she is the princess?
{118755}{118836}Of course she's the princess.
{118896}{118969}Let's try shock treatment.
{118978}{119022}Shock treatment?
{119087}{119267}"Godzilla and Rodan are approaching!|Evacuate this area immediately!"
{119275}{119384}Let's get her. Know we know where she is.
{119563}{119614}Doctor, what shall we do?
{119617}{119702}We can't stop the process now.
{119706}{119748}It's Godzilla!
{120474}{120560}Increase the voltage to 500.
{120574}{120629}No more, or she'll die.
{121310}{121347}Now what?
{121350}{121438}We don't need to dirty our hands to kill her.
{121794}{121834}3,000 volts?
{121856}{121900}She won't survive.
{121938}{121983}Let's check it again.
{122009}{122094}Go away! Godzilla is coming!
{123021}{123098}- It's OK.|- Good. Let's start.
{123288}{123343}Are you sure it's at 500?
{123346}{123375}Yes.
{123612}{123724}- The power's gone off.|- Let me check it.
{123954}{124009}Doctor! The assassins!
{124144}{124174}We're in time.
{124272}{124308}Stay here.
{124548}{124582}Go to the front door!
{125215}{125262}Doctor! It's alright now!
{125602}{125633}Anyone here?
{125858}{125899}Oi, wait!
{126057}{126090}Brother!
{126107}{126167}Stupid! What are you doing here?
{126175}{126217}Mothra is coming!
{126219}{126237}What?
{126239}{126299}Don't just stand there. Help us!
{129894}{129971}Doctor! Where are your staff?
{129976}{130032}They're right behind us.
{130038}{130099}- You said Mothra was coming?|- Yes.
{130102}{130175}- Why?|- To fight King Ghidorah.
{130177}{130294}Leave this place quickly before it|become a land of death!
{130311}{130378}What did you find out?
{130382}{130432}She really must be from Jupiter.
{130596}{130700}Stop the car! Mothra! Mothra is here!
{130746}{130787}Get out of the car.
{130864}{130933}Quickly, quickly! Let's go up.
{134771}{134807}Take this.
{135286}{135349}Mothra is talking to them.
{135511}{135583}What are they saying to each other?
{135609}{135725}What do I know? I don't speak|monster language.
{135780}{135824}What is she saying?
{135862}{135984}She is trying to persuade them.|But they don't agree.
{135996}{136191}She says, "Let's stop fighting each|other and unite against King Ghidorah."
{136196}{136254}Do Godzilla and Rodan agree?
{136259}{136451}No. Godzilla and Rodan say it's none of|their business. They don't care.
{136455}{136544}Damn them.
{136558}{136823}Godzilla says he has no reason to help humans.|Humans always make trouble.
{136852}{136933}Rodan says he agrees.
{137049}{137100}Get out of the way!
{137115}{137184}Fool! Selfish dog!
{137320}{137357}Ghidorah!
{138302}{138431}Mothra is saying "Don't|fight anymore. It's no use."
{138436}{138606}But Godzilla and Rodan|both want an apology.
{138826}{138926}But, Mothra is still trying.
{138932}{139061}Damn them! I thought only humans|could be so stubborn!
{139619}{139684}Hey, see if the trail is clear.
{139723}{139748}What is it?
{139755}{139813}The road is blocked.
{139847}{139911}There's only one way left.
{139920}{139960}Follow us!
{140021}{140085}Haven't they agreed yet?
{140102}{140157}They're still talking.
{140192}{140258}We should move up higher.
{140440}{140540}Come on, let's keep moving!
{140899}{141036}Mothra is telling them that the Earth|doesn't just belong to humans.
{141041}{141246}It's theirs too, so they should defend it.|They're almost convinced.
{141401}{141452}No, they're not.
{141458}{141510}What will happen now?
{141515}{141592}Mothra is going to fight alone.
{141630}{141673}That's impossible!
{141934}{142078}Godzilla, Rodan! Go!|Fight with Mothra!
{142082}{142133}Mothra! Good luck!
{143838}{143927}Godzilla and Rodan are going to fight!
{143946}{144041}Hey! The princess has disappeared!
{144091}{144114}Look that way!
{144214}{144246}I'm going this way.
{145565}{145678}Go back! The fire has cut the path!
{148746}{148838}O God, creator of the universe!
{148843}{148947}Save this planet from the evil monster.
{148963}{149050}Save it from becoming a dead star.
{149248}{149273}Princess!
{149492}{149549}Princess! Get down!
{151777}{151869}Malness! You traitor!
{151962}{152008}You've recovered your memory?
{152021}{152068}Who are you?
{152070}{152166}I'm a Japanese police officer.|I'm your bodyguard.
{152365}{152397}I'm alright.
{153568}{153592}What's that?
{153604}{153652}My brothers raincoat!
{153831}{153889}Brother!
{153890}{153950}Hey, Shindo!
{153976}{154017}Hey!
{154021}{154121}Go to the hut on the pass and bring a rope!
{156313}{156353}Good.
{158653}{158810}Doctor! Doctor, doctor.|What's happening? What shall we do?
{159339}{159402}It's the end of our village.
{159495}{159547}Look! A landslide!
{162075}{162123}Anything to say?
{162137}{162303}I wonder... did I really say|I was from Jupiter?
{162310}{162418}Yes, but you had your wits|about you all the time.
{162425}{162564}And your predictions were right.|No human could have done that.
{162571}{162662}But, how did I recover my memory?
{162678}{162878}You had a real shock.|You were shot here. It worked.
{162882}{163034}Could I ever have these powers again?
{163037}{163280}Well, I couldn't say.|It's still beyond my ability.
{163812}{163870}Thank you, Shindo.
{163892}{163979}You saved my life three times.
{163991}{164034}Three times?
{164079}{164139}At the hotel.
{164165}{164226}At the laboratory.
{164271}{164323}And when I got shot.
{164329}{164428}You remember what happened at|the hotel and laboratory?
{164483}{164568}I don't remember anything else.
{164581}{164695}Only that you saved me.|I don't know why.
{164869}{165014}I won't ever forget what you did.
{165019}{165161}Princess. I wish you a long and happy life.
{165465}{165518}Thank you so much.
{166648}{166808}Goodbye everyone! We're going|back to Infant Island.
{166821}{166956}Goodbye! Goodbye!
{167025}{167150}"THE END"

Zotz?
What's Zotz?
(INHALING DEEPLY) One.
Two.
Three.
Uncle Jonathan.
CYNTHIA: Morning,
Uncle Jonathan.
Morning, darling
Poison. Slow death.
Yes, but what a way to go.
Straight sauerkraut juice!
How do you do it?
Very bracing.
You must try it sometime.
How's the wheat germ?
Sounds good.
Superb.
Oh, that must be the mailman.
No, I'll get it.
I'm expecting a journal of the
American Etymological Society.
Anything for me?
Just a postcard from your vacationing parents. 
Hey, Venice, very pretty
Nothing from Eddie?
Eddie? Who's Eddie?
You know very well who
Eddie is. Eddie Prentiss.
One of your brightest pupils last term.
Prentiss. Prentiss.
The boy who won a fellowship and went on an archaeological expedition to Uk... Uk...
Uh, Ukranistan?
Yes. That is from Eddie.
Only teasing you, darling.
Oh, look, a present.
It's a charm bracelet.
Mmm, it's very pretty.
What does Prentiss have to say?
Just a lot of personal stuff. You know.
I know.
But he says he'll be home soon.
They found the ruins they were looking for.
Mmm. Excellent.
In fact, the charm on the bracelet is some ancient coin he found in a temple they uncovered there.
It was attached to the right hand of a gigantic stone idol, he says.
It's a relic from some ancient civilization.
Isn't that exciting?
Mmm.
"Shesh, shash."
Shesh, shash.
Jones!
Morning, Kellgore.
You almost ran me down.
Oh, I'm very sorry.
But I didn't, did I?
No, but you ca me awfully close.
Please accept my apologies, old man. Shesh, shash.
Uh, what'd you say?
What? Say? Oh, nothing,
Kellgore, nothing.
Well, it sounded like you said "shesh, shash."
Oh, yes, I did.
Quite right.
Yes. Shesh, shash.
Morning, Kellgore.
Morning, Jones.
Good morning.
STUDENTS: Good morning,
Professor.
Yesterday, we considered the transmutation of certain words from the Assyro Babylonic.
And we noted that the Assyro 
Babylonic word for house, bitu, appears in the classical Hebrew as...
As what, Mr. Crane?
Uh, bayeth.
Well, almost right, Mr. Crane.
Thank you.
The correct pronunciation is bayeth.
And who can tell us what form the word takes in Aramaic?
Yes, Miss Blakiston?
Baytha
Quite right, Miss Blakisto
Thank you.
You could build a tremendous edifice of error based on the fact that the Hebrew and
Sanskrit words for "six" are almost identical, although wholly unrelated.
They are, if I may remind you, sheshand shash.
Shesh, shash?
Uh, yes, sir. Right in the middle of the campus, this morning. Shesh, shash
Professor Kellgore, I don't think we need worry ourselves.
Professor Jones is a very brilliant man in the field of ancient Eastern languages, as you are brilliant in the field of modern
European languages.
I think we can allow him a few little peculiarities, hmm?
Sir, I'm sure that
Professor Jones is excellent in the classroom.
Well, then?
But his executive ability...
Could Saracen Valley have a dean of language who goes around muttering "shesh, shash"?
Hmm. Well, I haven't retired yet, Professor, nor have I named my successor.
It's still a choice between you and Professor Jones.
Then you haven't decided yet?
Not yet.
Then you'll take this
"shesh, shash"matter under consideration?
Oh, I will, I will.
Thank you, Professor.
Good morning.
Good morning, Dean.
Good morning.
Shesh, shash.
Uncle Jonathan?
Yes.
How was your day?
Oh, fine.
What's for dinner?
Filet of eggplant?
Filet of eggplant.
Medium rare?
Of course.
Ah!
(SNIFFING) Mmm.
Oh, pass the monosodium glutamate, please.
Thank you.
Say, you know, dear, he really shouldn't have sent this to you.
That's rightfully the property of...
Why, it's Astyparaean!
Asty what?
Hey, that's mine.
Yes, yes, I know.
But if you don't...
It's from Eddie.
It's like a fraternity pin or an engagement ring.
But you don't understand, darling.
That inscription is in the ancient
Astyparaean language.
Am I supposed to know what that is?
It's a language that's been dead for over 5,000 years.
Why, there are only 10 men in the world who can identify it, much less translate it.
And I can.
But...
Now, look, dear, maybe this inscription is an ancient love poem.
Something Eddie would want you to hear, hmm?
Well...
Ah, yes, of course.
"First graspeth thou the sacred disk in thy left hand.
"Now cometh the letting of, letting of..."
Letting of...
Blood, of course.
"Letting of blood.
"And the drinking.
.. Drinking of blood."
"Now remaineth only the pronouncing
"of the sacred...
"Sacred name of the great god, Zotz!"
No! Please! Please!
Let me in!
Please! You can't leave me out in this storm. Not like this.
Put this on quickly!
Oh. Thanks.
You're welcome.
Now, please go.
Like this?
Well, you can't stay here.
But I have to.
It's the most amazing thing that's ever happened to me.
I'm not going to embarrass you by asking you how you got into this condition.
After all, I'm a man of the world.
I was struck by lightning.
You were what?
Well, I was hurrying along, trying to beat out this sudden storm, when...
Well, I think I was struck by lightning.
Mmm. I have heard of cases where people were struck by lightning and had their clothes torn off without hurting them.
Usually these people were branded by the mark of the bolt.
I seem to be all right.
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.
But you can't stay here.
I mean, I'm a bachelor.
I don't have a wife.
I'm not married.
Well, what can I do?
(STAMMERING) Do? What can you do? I don't... My niece!
I'll wake her up. Uh, no.
She might think...
I mean, not that she'd have any real... I mean...
I'll go upstairs and get some of her clothes.
They'll probably fit.
I think you're about the same size. Anyway, you wait right here.
Oh, I will. I will.
Uncle Jonathan?
Oh, it's all right, dear.
Go back to sleep.
Well, what...
(STAMMERING) Nothing. 
Just let it go.
There. Now, please go!
Well, can I put them on first?
Oh, oh, yes, of course.
I'll, uh, turn my back.
Oh, thanks.
You haven't asked me my name.
No, I haven't.
Uh, I thought it was better that way.
I agree.
Do they, uh, fit?
Most of them.
The shoes are a little big, and the...
Something else is a little small, but I'll get by.
What? Oh, yes.
You can turn around now.
(LAUGHS) Will I do?
Well, at least you won't be cold.
I want to thank you.
Not only for what you did, but for what you're going to do.
Going to do?
Forget about this.
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Of course.
Oh, you'd better take this with you.
Oh. Oh, no, it's stopped.
It has?
Why, so it has. Odd.
"So foul and fair a day I have not seen."
That's Shakespeare.
Macbeth,Act One, I know.
You do?
Uh-huh.
Well.
Good night.
Uh, good night.
Macbeth.Act One.
And there are other basic affinities in the languages of this group.
For example, in all of them, ancient and modern, masculine nouns take a feminine number, and vice versa, from three to 10.
Who can give us an example of this grammatical idiosyncrasy?
Yes, Mr. Crane?
Are you all right,
Mr. Crane? Would you like to be excused?
Uh, no. I'm all right now.
Uh, it must have been something I ate.
Uh, an example.
The word for "goat," for instance, is masculine, but three goats is feminine.
Oh, very good, Mr. Crane. 
That's quite right.
And now, who can tell us in what parts of the modern world the Turkish language is spoken?
Yes, Miss Blakiston.
Actually, although it's not generally known,
Osmanli is the head of a large family of tongues.
The Turkish language in its several dialects is spoken from Central Persia to...
Is something wrong,
Professor Jones?
Uh, wrong? Oh, no, no,
Miss Blakiston.
From Central
Persia to Siberia.
The dialects sometimes differ greatly.
For example...
Uh, that's fine,
Miss Blakiston, thank you.
But I haven't finished.
Class dismissed.
"Thus is gained the ancient threefold power,
"the first part of which is that
"of the pointing finger,
"known as the power of the sudden pain."
The sudden pain.
My goodness.
"The second part of which is that
"of the uttered name,
"known as the power
"of retarded movement."
Zotz!
Mercy sakes.
"The third and last part of which is that of the
"pointing finger and the uttered name together."
Well...
Zotz!
The silent death.
"He who holdeth this sacred disk shall be
"imbued with this dreaded threefold power
"only so long as it remains in his possession.
"And should it pass into the hands of another,
"that other will hold the power
"for a short time only."
Hmm.
Zotz!
Good afternoon, Jones.
Oh, hello, Kellgore.
Uh, what have you got ther
It looks like a lizard.
Lizard? Where? Oh, this.
Oh, this lizard. Oh, yes.
Yes, a remarkable example of saurian life.
Yes, direct descendant of the dinosaur.
Is that so? I didn't kno w you were interested in that sort of thing.
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.
Fascinating subject.
Mmm. You don't say.
Oh, incidentally, Jones,
I suppose you've met our new colleague, Professor Fenster?
No, I haven't.
What's Professor
Fenster's field?
Modern European languages, or so I'm told.
Why, that's your field.
Yes, it is. One might almost think they're considering, what do you call it? 
Kicking me upstairs.
Yeah. Or downstairs.
Yes. Well, toodle-oo, Jone
Have fun with your dinosaur.
Toodle-oo.
Zotz!
Extraordinary!
Zo...
Professor Jones, are you feeling all right?
Yes, sir, never better. Yes.
I understand you dismissed your class early today?
Why, yes, yes.
I gave them a heavy assignment for the weekend.
I thought I'd better let them get to the library before it closed
But the library is open until 8:00 tonight.
8:00? Oh, yes, so it is.
Yes. Hard to keep up with these new rules.
That rule's been in effect ever since 1918.
But no matter.
I'm glad I ran across you.
I want to invite you for cocktails this evening in my lodgings.
Oh, how nice.
I want you and the other members of the faculty to meet a new colleague.
Oh, Professor Fenster?
Oh, then you've met?
No, no.
Oh, well, in that case, may we expect you at 6:00?
Oh, yes, yes, indeed. 
Yes, sir.
Excellent. Splendid.
Oh, and, Professor?
Yes, Dean.
Don't work too hard.
JONATHAN: Zotz!
Amazing.
Uncle Jonathan.
Better hurry if you're going to make that cocktail party at 6:00.
Yeah. Would you get me that package on my bureau, darling?
What's in it?
Oh, just some things
I bought downtown.
Thank you.
I won't be here when you get back, so don't wait up.
You have a date?
Uh-huh. Jimmy.
Jimmy who?
Jimmy Kellgore.
He's not much, but he' ll do till Eddie gets home.
Jimmy Kellgore!
Horatio Kellgore's boy?
Yes. Oh, it's not serious or anything like that.
It's just a date.
Not a date, date.
But Kellgore's son.
Oh, Jimmy's all right.
Kind of a wolf, but I can handle him.
Zotz!
Zotz!
Zotz!
You'd better hurry,
Uncle Jonathan.
All right, I'm coming.
Cynthia, baby.
Well, are you all ready to go?
Anytime you are.
Okay.
Ah, Professor Jones.
How nice of you to come. 
Will you have a martini?
Oh, no, thank you, sir.
Uh, I don't suppose you have any sauerkraut juice?
Why, no, I don't think.
Uh, my... Persephone?
Yes?
Do we happen to have any sauerkraut juice?
Sauerkraut juice?
I don't think so.
Oh, perhaps we could get you a soft drink, Professor?
That would be fine,
Mrs. Updike.
Take Hercules for a moment, please, Joshua.
And get rid of that pipe. 
You know it makes
Hercules ill.
There we are.
Thank you, Mrs. Updike.
Get rid of that pipe
Uh, yes, thanks.
Will you take Hercules?
Thank you so much.
Professor, if you only knew how much the dean and I admire your abstinence from strong drink, your sensible diet, your devotion to exercise.
As the ancients said,
Mens sana in corpore sano.
Oh, yes, indeed.
I think of you as one of the great and classic educators of yore.
Plato, Aristotle, in flowing robes, stately, sober, dignified.
Roaming the groves of academe, dispensing wisdom and knowledge.
And now, please come and meet the new member of our faculty.
Professor Fenster,
I'd like you to meet
Professor Jonathan Jones ancient Eastern languages.
Glad to meet you,
Professor Jones.
(STAMMERING) I...
Charmed.
Joshua.
Yes, my dear.
Please take Hercules.
Yes, a pleasure.
There we are.
Now you'll excuse me, please.
Oh, certainly.
Yes. Of course.
By George, that's a beautiful cat.
Yes, isn't it?
He loves strangers.
Would you like to hold him?
(CHUCKLES) Uh...
Dean?
Let me get this straight.
You are Professor Fenster?
Well, my friends call me Virginia.
And to think you're the famous Jonathan Jones.
Oh, well, not so famous.
Not so famous?
Why, everybody in the field is familiar with your doctorate thesis on the transmutation of the Latin "F" to "B" in Teutonic languages.
Well, that was quite a while ago.
And I simply devoured your latest book.
Really?
The Semantics of
Dionysius of Halicarnassus?
Yes. I could hardly put it down.
Well. But I thought your field was modern languages, like Professor Kellgore's.
Oh, well, it is.
Oh.
But I've also studied ancient Eastern languages.
Like me.
Like you.
I see.
Very interesting. Very.
Uh, tell me, of these two specialties, 
Professor Fenster...
Virginia.
Virginia.
Of these two specialties, 
Virginia, which will you utilize here?
Well, I wish I knew. The dean told me I was to prepare myself for either course.
He said he has an important decision to make.
But really, Professor Jones...
Jonathan.
Jonathan.
Really, I think it's so fascinating to meet the author of those wonderful books.
You can teach me so much.
I warn you, you're going to see a lot of me.
Yes, well, I've already seen a lot of you, Virginia.
You were going to forget all about that, remember?
Ah, forgive me.
I stand corrected.
Then those charming translations of the French fabliau were yours?
Yes. I loved doing them.
I loved reading them.
Been hunting any dinosaurs lately, Jones?
Not lately.
What on earth did he mean by that?
I haven't the faintest idea.
What's she hanging around there for?
Oh, what a kook. If...
(SHUSHING) Quiet
You wouldn't be afraid to be in that house alone with old Jim here, would ya?
Jimmy, you promised.
Oh, come on.
Jimmy! Stop it!
Oh, well, you're safe with me.
That's what you think.
What's the matter?
I don't know
I'm okay now, though.
Are you sure?
Let's just wat ch the movie, huh?
Gladly.
At Harvard, I was a history major, actually.
Then I narrowed my specialty to the Asianic cultures.
Under Professor Sandor?
Yes. A wonderful old man.
He stimulated my interest in ancient languages.
Sanskrit, Hebrew, Astyparaean.
Astyparaean!
That reminds me.
Excuse me for a moment,
I must speak to the dean on an important matter.
Sir?
Oh, hello, my boy.
How are you getting along with Professor Fenster?
Oh, fine, sir.
Splendid.
A most talented young lady.
Yes, she is.
But I have something I want to discuss with you
Oh? Very well.
Yes, sir. I had to tell someone.
It's so important, and, well, you're the only one to whom I could turn.
Then by all means, my boy.
Well, sir, it's this power I have.
Power?
Yes, sir
The power to disable, even to kill.
Kill?
I know it sounds fantastic, and it's going to be very hard for you to believe, but...
Well, I really don't know where to begin.
May I make a suggestion?
Please do.
Begin at the beginning, go on until you come to the end.
Then stop.
No, I think it would be better if I begin at the end and work back.
In fact, that's why
I brought these along.
I knew I'd have a hard time convincing you without proof so on the way over
I stopped in at a pet shop.
Great Scott, Jones.
Those are mice, aren't they?
Just white mice, sir.
But...
They're absolutely essenti to my demonstration, sir.
What demonstration?
The demonstration of the power of Zotz
Zotz?
Yes, sir. Zotz.
And if you will allow me
Well, I most certainly will not allow you.
Do you mean to tell me you intend to let these creatures out here?
Yes, sir.
Have you taken leave of your senses? d,
Trust me, sir. Within one split second after those mice are release they will be motionles s, harmless, lifeless.
Zotz! Zotz! Zotz!
Jones!
Ellen Mae, what a lovely cake.
It's beautiful.
I just can't wait to taste it.
Zotz!
Zotz! Zotz!
Zotz! Zotz!
Zotz! Zotz!
Zotz! Zotz!
Zotz!
Zotz!
It's all right, dear.
Everything's all right.
(SIGHS) Thank you very much.
Zotz, I said! Zotz! 
Z-O-T-Z, Zotz!
Jones! Come up.
Why have you done this?
I don't understand.
It worked before.
I simply pointed while the coin was in my pocket.
What coin?
This one
The coin that I...
I'm sure I have it.
Oh, no! Cynthia!
She must have taken it.
What about Cynthia?
Why, this is terrible.
She's going out tonight. 
She doesn't know the power she possesses.
Jones! I...
Excuse me, sir.
I must stop her.
I demand...
Check.
Cynthia? Cynthia? Cynthia?
Cynthia? Oh.
Hello, Virginia.
Jonathan.
Is something wrong?
Yes, something is terribly wrong.
Well, what is it?
Can I help?
No, nobody can help.
Wait a minute.
Have you got your car?
Yes.
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go.
Where to?
I don't know.
First Street, I guess.
And keep your eye peeled for a hot rod containing a very pretty girl and the son of Horatio Kellgore.
What is this all about?
Well, there's this little...
You wouldn't believe it.
You wouldn't believe it.
Say, I know a cozy, little spot where we could...
Just a soda, please.
Just a soda.
Yeah, I get the message.
There they are.
Where do you want to go?
How about the Sip and Dip?
Let's see, the Sip and Dip. That's north of here, isn't it?
No. It's south.
No, no. No, no, no!
I'm sure the ice cream parlor is that way.
Okay.
Follow that car!
Cynthia!
Hi, Uncle Jonathan.
What are you doing here?
Cynthia, come home at once.
What?
Come home at once.
Never mind.
Stay right there.
I'll get you.
It's all right, darling.
Come along with me.
But Uncle Jonathan!
No arguments.
Well, we were only going over to the...
Stop!
Excuse me.
Don't do that.
Why?
Because it's not polite to point.
Huh?
Come along, darling. You'd better let me have this, too.
And after all that, he say
"It's not polite to point."
Uh, that's all?
That's all.
What a kook!
Yeah, very interesting.
Well, thank you, my boy.
Run along to bed.
Okay. Good night, Dad.
Good night.
Good morning, darling.
Good morning.
Poison. Slow death.
Uncle Jonathan.
Yes.
All that stuff you said last night about the coin...
What were you drinking at the dean's party?
Soda pop, of course.
What are you implying?
Well, it's all a little hard to swallow, you know.
That stuff about ancient magic and the pointing finger and...
What was that word again?
Never mind.
Uncle Jonathan, have you been feeling all right?
Of course I have.
I'm in the pink of condition.
Well, then, why do you have an appointment with the doctor this morning?
Doctor? I have no appointment with a doctor.
Yes, you do. At 9:00.
Miss Carruthers of the medical staff phoned to remind you when you were in the shower.
She said the dean made the appointment.
Really? That's odd.
Ah, it must be the annual physical checkup.
Good idea, actually.
Mens sana in corpore sano, you know.
What?
Sound mind in a sound body.
9:00, you said?
I'd better be on my way. 
Bye, darling.
Bye.
Uh, good morning.
I'm Professor Jones.
Oh, good morning, Professor.
You can go right in.
Dr. Kroner's expecting you.
Thank you.
Good morning, Dr. Kroner. 
Pleasure to meet you.
I'm Jones, ancient Eastern languages.
Sit down, Professor.
It's a very sensib le thing, checkups.
As I was saying to my niece only this morning,
Mens sana in corpore sano.
Quite.
I think you'll find me in top condition.
Exercise, a sensible diet, don't drink, don't smoke.
Professor Jones,
I think perhaps...
These are my own. 
Every single one
Hearing, perfect. 
Vision, 20/20.
Blood pressure..
Sir!
...seven. Yes?
Please put your clothes back on and then make yourself comfortable on the couch.
Put my clothes...
Put them back... Oh!
Very well, if you wish.
I simply thought that I...
Couch?
Yes. Just lie down and relax.
You mean you're that kind of a doctor?
Now, don't worry about a thing, Professor.
The dean sent me to you? 
He thinks I'm crazy?
Now, now, now, now.
Crazy's an unfortunate word, don't you agree?
I certainly do! And if you think I'm going to submit to an examination by a...
Do you always react so violently?
Violently?
Why, no. Not at all.
In fact, I'm a quiet man
Studious.
Oh, I see, quiet and studious sometimes and violent at other times.
Almost like two different people, hmm?
Now, look here.
If you're trying to say
I'm schizophrenic...
Oh. Do you feel that
I'm persecuting you?
No!
It all began when my niece received a charm bracelet.
Oh, Professor Kellgore.
Professor Fenster.
Do you know where I might find
Professor Jones this morning?
I have a little translation problem
I'd like to discuss with him.
Jones? Jones?
No, I haven't seen him since the cocktail party yesterday evening.
(LAUGHS) Behaved very peculiarly, didn't he?
Perhaps I can help.
Well, I'm afraid it's in t field of ancient languages
Professor Kellgore.
Call me Horatio.
Well, I must run. 
Thanks, anyway.
Please continue, Professor.
That's all there is to tell.
Yes.
Now, if I understand you correctly, you say that you're actually able to destroy living creatures by pointing your finger at them and speaking this word, "Zotz."
Yes, but only if the coin is on my person.
Don't you see that all this is mere delusion?
Delusion?
Why, I've seen it with my own eyes.
A line of people on the sidewalk, mown down as if by a machine gun.
Hallucination.
It was not hallucination
And there was the moth and the cat and the ships and the squirrel and the dinosaur
The dinosaur, Professor?
I mean, the lizard.
Just a little lizard, you know.
Yes. Yes, of course. It was a baby dinosaur, wasn't it?
Yeah, it was...
No, no, no.
Professor Jones, you're an intelligent man and I won't try to humor you
But surely you can understand that these delusions of yours are merely a result of your repressed hostility, your aggressive feelings toward society.
I have no aggressive feeling toward society, Dr. Kroner.
I must confess, at this moment, however,
I have aggressive feelings toward you.
(CHUCKLES) Well, that's a perfectly normal reaction.
As a matter of fact, you're a classic case.
I will not be referred to as a "classic case!"
Sir, this power of yours does not exist.
It does exist!
Then show me.
What?
Show me. Convince me.
Demonstrate this horrible force, this power you have over life and death.
Very well. But what shall 
I demonstrate it on?
Me.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Why not?
Well, it would cause you pain.
Well, now why should that concern you?
You've already said that you have aggressive feelings toward me.
Here's your chance to unleash them.
Oh, I can't.
Of course you can't.
Because this power is not real.
It is.
It's imaginary.
It's not.
Not what?
Not real. I mean imaginary.
There, you see?
You can't distinguish between reality and imagination.
I'm sorry, Doctor, but there's no other way
(LAUGHS) You put on a good act, Professor.
Remember, you brought this on yourself.
Go ahead. Take out your hostility on me.
It will do you a world of good.
I was doubled over, like this.
It was very painful.
Perhaps he hypnotized you.
Well, I know a bit more abou hypnosis than you do, Dean, and I can assure you
I was not hypnotized
Then, how do you explain it?
Very simple.
Appendicitis
I shall enter the hospital the first thing in the morning.
No, no.
Of course not, my boy.
It's simply that I think you need a rest.
Sir, I'm in perfect health.
Go away for a few days.
A week.
Please, sir, if you'd only listen to me
Go someplace to relax.
Take a trip.
A trip?
Yes.
A trip.
Well, I think you'd better try
Lieutenant Stefanski, sir.
He may be able to help you.
You don't understand
I don't want him to help m
I want to help him.
Yes, sir.
But you'd better see the lieutenant anyway.
You'll find him in 3C-4L-3-S-19.
Three C...
It's very simple, sir.
You see, this building has five sides,
A, B, C, D and E.
Now 3C means the third floor of side C. That way.
That way.
The next number tells you what corridor to take.
Four.
That's right over there.
Over there.
The second three means the third court, then, S-19 is the 19th stanchion on your left.
You can't miss it, sir.
Thank you. What was that floor again?
Third floor, sir.
Third floor.
You see, Lieutenant Stefanski, they sent me in to see you, but...
Professor Jones, I'm afraid the army isn't interested.
There are many such suggestions that come across my desk every day, and we are not interested.
Now you listen to me...
Oh, now be reasonable, Henry.
I handled the last one.
That screwball with the steam-operated machine gun.
It's your turn now.
What do you mean, you've got a stomach ache?
What about
Lieutenant Stefanski?
Captain Byron? Major Foulger?
They've all got stomach aches?
I tell you, it's that lousy food they serve in the cafeteria.
All right. All right, send him over.
Yes?
General Bullivar.
Yes.
There's a Professor Jones who wishes to see you.
I know. I know.
Tell him to wheel it in.
Wheel what in, sir?
A death ray, or whatever it is he thinks he's invented.
He doesn't have anything with him, sir.
Not even a briefcase.
Oh, one of those quiet ones, huh?
Well, I guess there's no use delaying it. Send him in.
Yes, sir
Professor Jones, sir
Hello there, how are you?
So you're the fellow that's come all the way from
California just to talk to us.
Yes, sir.
I'm delighted to meet you, Professor.
Thank you, General.
Sit down. Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.
(CLEARS THROAT) Well, thank you very much.
Well, did you have a pleasant trip?
Most pleasant, thanks.
And how are you enjoying your visit to the capital?
Well, I only arrived this morning...
Now, take my advice, don't miss the Lincoln Memorial.
It's a very moving experience.
It brings tears to my eyes every time I see it.
Well, I'm sure it's most impressive.
Have a cigar.
What? No, thank you. 
Do you mind if I get right to the point?
Oh, yes, of course.
The colonel mentioned something about a new weapon.
Well, it's not exactly a weapon
Oh? Well, what is it?
A gun, a bomb?
Would you be interested in a method to immobilize, even destroy, as you choose, every living thing within range of vision?
Ships, tanks, planes
How do you intend to go about this?
Light rays?
Sound vibrations?
Black magic?
Yes.
Yes, what?
Black magic. You see, 
I'm a human weapon.
Now, look, Professor,
I do not have the time to stand around making jokes.
I'm not joking,
I assure you.
A human weapon!
Are you serious?
I've never been mo re serious in my life
You see...
I see. I see.
You're some sort of a magician, huh?
What?
Look, I'm afraid they've sent you to the wrong department.
Now what you want is the Entertainment Division of Special Services.
I'll make one little phone call and settle this whole thing for you.
No! Wait! Wait!
Now, get me Colonel...
General! I can prove it.
Never mind.
All right, prove it.
Excuse me.
Look. That airplane up there.
Uh-huh.
Now watch this.
I'm watching
You see?
Wonderful! Marvelous!
Now watch this.
Uh-huh.
There. And the secret lies in this ancient coin.
In that coin?
Well, well, well
And you see, this makes it possible to...
You know, this is a marvelous little inventi you have here, Professor.
Well, it's not exactly an invention...
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.
I'm going to have my secretary help you fill out form number W5A16, in quadruplicate...
But, sir...
This will be filed and duly considered at the next meeting of the Chiefs of Staff.
How long before
I hear from you?
Well, the next meeting is sometime in December.
December!
Yes, yes.
Of course, anything suggested at that meeting will have to be forwarded onto higher echelons.
But this power of mine is immediate...
Well, of course,
I believe that if you leave your name and address, you can expect to receive some sort of communication from us after the first of the year.
What sort of communication?
Well, now...
General, don't you think the state of world conditions today demands that you take immediate...
I think that you're absolutely right, and we are wasting time standing here talking about it.
Yes, we are.
I'm glad that we see eye to eye.
And I will start the wheels in motion right now.
Corporal, I want you to drop everything and help Professor Jones here fill out form W5A16.
Thank you, Professor.
No, sir, but, General...
Please sit down, Professor.
This may take a while.
Well, thanks, but don't bother.
But what about form W5A16?
You tell the general that he can...
Oh, never mind.
I beg your pardon.
Don't I know you?
No, I don't believe so.
My name is Hugh Fundy.
What is that, may I ask?
This? This is a death ray.
Oh. Well, good luck.
Uncle Jonathan, I didn't expect you home tonight.
Well, I decided to cut my trip short.
Hey, you're all dressed up. How come?
For the farewell dinner for the dean, you remember.
Gee, it's nice you returned in time for it.
Yeah, I'd better change.
I won't be five minutes.
Well, I'll meet you at the country club.
Can't you wait while I change?
Well, gee, Uncle Jonathan,
I expected you to be out of town tonight, and I told Jimmy I'd go with him. And there he is.
Bye, see you at the club.
There's sauerkraut juice in the fridge.
I'm coming!
Virginia!
Hello.
Oh, hello, Virginia?
Jonathan.
Oh, Jonathan, you're back.
So soon?
Yeah, I got homesick,
I guess.
Say, the reason
I'm calling, I...
I thought I might escort you to the farewell dinner tonight.
Well, I'm awfully sorry, but I was sure you'd be away and I...
Well, I accepted an invitation to go with Horatio.
Horatio. Kellgore?
Well, yes. You see...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Now, please try to understand.
Oh, I understand.
I understand perfectly.
Oh, Jonathan.
Bye.
Well, here we are.
Dean Updike, of course, and Mrs. Updike,
Professor Adams, the principal and, Virginia,
I want you to sit there, and of course, I shall occupy the speaker's chair.
Is everything satisfactory,
Professor Kellgore?
Oh, yes.
Yes, it seems to be.
Of course, this is a very special occasion, you understand.
I want everything exactly right. I've made myself personally responsible.
Of course.
Perhaps I may have the waiter bring you a cocktail before the others arrive?
No, no. It might relax me too much.
(LAUGHS) Have to make a speech right after dinner.
Yes.
Good evening.
Hello. Hi, Dad. Hello,
Professor Fenster.
Hello, Jimmy.
Hello, Cynthia.
Just in time, James.
Good evening, Cynthia.
I'm so sorry your uncle won't be able to make it tonight.
Better check the wine.
Oh, but he's back.
I told him to meet us here.
I know, dear, but when I talked to h im on the phone just now, he said he was too exhausted from his tri p, that he wouldn't come.
Virginia, would you check the guest list?
It's a good thing, if you ask me.
What do you mean?
Well, we all want everythi to be nice for the dean's farewell dinner, don't we?
Are you implying that my Uncle Jonathan...
Look, don't get be nt out of shape.
Your uncle's okay.
I guess. But everybody kno he's a little bit kooks.
Kooks!
Yeah.
Well, like that night he chased us in
Professor Fenster's car.
And, well, you heard about those mice, didn't you?
Jimmy Kellgore, if you...
Oh, forget it.
Let's sit down, huh?
James?
Yeah, Dad?
Would you come here?
Excuse me.
Yeah, Dad?
Now, James, I want to caution you about the way you behave tonight.
No raucousness or ungentlemanly behavior.
Oh, sure, Dad.
This is a very important evening, you understand.
The dean still hasn't named a successor, and his decision could stand or fall on the impression that I create at the dinner.
Understand?
I dig.
Don't... Speak English.
(LAUGHS) Oh, dear.
Good evening, my dear Dean.
Professor.
Good evening... Oh!
Mrs. Updike. May I say that you look dangerously lovely this evening?
Professor Kellgore, you say the most awful things.
It was very nice of you to preside tonight, Kellgore.
Well, when I heard that Professor Jones would be absent,
I felt that someone had to take things in hand.
Yes, quite so.
Poor Jones.
Excellent man, really, but...
I'm sorry, my dear,
I didn't mean to...
That's all right, sir.
Shall we sit down?
The others should be along presently.
Dean, the chair of honor, of course. There you are
Get out of the way, will you?
Mrs. Updike, would you grace our table with your radiance?
Charmed.
"When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
"I all alone beweep my outcast state."
Here's how.
"And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
"and look upon myself, and curse my fate."
Oh...
And speaking of our beloved dean's regretted departure from our midst
I would like to borrow an aphorism from the works of the great La Rochefoucauld.
The...
Hello, everybody.
Sorry I'm late.
Accept my apologies, Horatio.
Yes, yes. It's good to see you, Jones. Most unexpected.
Did you have a nice trip?
Fantastic.
I hope you didn't miss the Lincoln Memorial, a very moving experience
Brings tears to my eyes every time I see it.
Yeah, well, if you don't mind, just sit down, please.
Yes.
Traitor.
Jonathan, you... n.
Don't bother to explai
My dear friends...
Friends?
My dear and true friends, although I usually abstain from intoxicating spirits,
I would on this occasi on like to indulge in sort of a token sip of this ceremonial champagne
It is indeed fitting that I propose a toast to our beloved dean.
And put into words the true feelings in my heart...
JONATHAN: Zotz!
(DISTORTED) Your knowledge has been a guiding hand for all these many years building towards dedication to something recognized the whole world over in the tremendous force of the noble language.
And so on this emotional occasion...
It's disgraceful.
The man's making a drunken exhibition of himself.
I know, my dear, but what can I do?
Assert yourself.
...hold this party in recognition...
Yes, yes, Kellgore.
Very nice indeed of you.
Thank you.
But I haven't finished yet.
Thank you, Kellgore.
That will be all.
I'm sure what my colleague, Professor
Kellgore, means to say is something which all of us feel in our hearts, but find very difficult to express
Simply ave atque vale.
Hail and farewell.
ALL: Hail and farewell.
Hail and farewell.
Hail.
Thank you, Jonathan.
Thank you very much.
It's good to have you among us again.
And now, for heaven's sake, let's enjoy ourselves.
Professor Jones?
Yes, I'm Jones.
A gentleman to see you, sir, just inside the main entrance.
To see me?
Yes, sir.
Oh, very well. Excuse me.
Who is kooks now?
Here, sir.
Thank you.
Professor Jones?
Yes.
Jonathan Jones?
That's right
(SIGHS) Well, I'm sure glad I was able to find you so quickly.
My name is Bates,
Josh Bates.
What can I do for you,
Mr. Bates?
Well, it's more a question of what we can do for you.
I'm with the government,
Professor.
Ah...
And I've been sent to bring you back to Washington.
I see. Well, perhaps first thing tomorrow morning.
No, sir. Now.
Now?
Yes, sir. Nobody knows better than yourself, sir, how important this matter is.
Yes, but I...
And how timely.
Well, that's true.
However, my friends and family in there...
And how secret, Professor.
Why, if you were to tell the that you were flying back to Washington tonight, word might leak out.
You have a point, Mr. Bates.
Still, if I could just have a few seconds with my niece, I...
There isn't time, Professor.
Please, sir.
The plane is waiting.
Well, you can phone your niece later.
All right, Mr. Bates. 
Let's go.
Very powerful plane.
Only the best for you, Professor.
Yes, very interesting.
I don't know what happened, but I had a feeling like I was floating.
Cynthia, where's your uncle?
I don't know.
I must get a checkup, you know. I'm sick,
I think. Really.
Excuse me.
Where are you going, 
Professor?
Mr. Bates.
Yes?
You are, you said, with the government?
That's right, Professor.
What government?
You will learn the answer to that question very soon.
I was afraid of that.
Oh, you need be afraid of nothing, Professor.
You are to be our honored guest.
But not in Washington?
Not, as you say, in Washington.
But this is preposterous! 
Why are your people interested in me?
Something about an ancient coin.
What coin?
The one with the secrets.
What secrets?
(LAUGHS) I neither know nor care.
Atomic secrets, I suppose, hidden inside it, or something of that nature.
I will relieve you of that object.
You will not do that again.
Oh, no? Why won't I?
Because we have taken certain precautions.
What kind of precautions?
I will tell you.
I see.
That's right, Professor.
If anything happens to me, or to this plane, my comrade, Igor, has orders...
I understand.
That is good
When we reach our destination, you will reveal to us the secrets of this coin
Until that time,
I will take charge of it
What?
The coin!
Oh. Oh, yes, the coin.
Give it to me.
You don't think I carry a thing like that around with me, do you?
What?
It's in a hiding place back in Saracen Valley.
Back in...
You'll have to turn the plane around.
Why, I don't know if we can...
It will be dangerous for us to return.
Dangerous for your niece and Professor Fenster, since we are expected at our destination at a specified time, and if we do not arrive, certain instructions will be radioed to Igor.
Therefore, I assume that you will allow me to search you in order to make absolutely sure that a return is necessary.
You're right.
The coin is not on you.
Now, then, where is this coin? At your home?
No.
Then, where?
First, you must take me to the place where my niece and Virginia Fenster are being held prisoner.
Before I give you anything,
I must make sure they're unharmed.
Capitalist pig!
It is I who make the bargains here, not you.
Now, remember this, Bates, or whatever your name is.
If those two ladies are hurt you'll have no threat to hold over my head.
And you will no longer be able to force me to co-operate with you.
Now, where are they?
The cellar of an office building in your city.
What building?
The Consolidated Building.
Then I suggest you instruct your friend to step on the gas.
Oh, and one more thing, Mr. Bates
Yes?
I hope you realize that if we don't get there in time, and your friend receives his radio orders to harm those two ladies, there will be absolutely nothing to prevent my using that secret weapon on you again, do you understand?
I understand.
No! No!
Cynthia. Virginia.
Are you all right?
Thank God.
Well, Professor, are you satisfied that the ladies are unharmed?
We will go now and get that coin.
Yes, I am satisfied the ladies are unharmed.
And it is now my pleasure to inform you that you are completely within my power.
What?
I withheld that power only to save them.
The hands.
But now...
Something about the hands.
Igor!
Let me...
Ow!
I don't know what this secret weapon of yours is, or how you operate it.
I suppose it's some mechanism concealed in your clothes, but I did observe that in order to activate it, you had to raise your arms.
And unless I'm gravely mistaken, I have now rendered you powerless.
It's no use, Professor, that tape is very strong.
Now, shall we go and get that coin?
All right. You win.
Very sensible.
After you, sir.
May I say goodbye to my niece?
I'm a civilized man.
Of course you may.
Thank you.
Uncle Jonathan.
(SOFTLY) Listen, if you and Virginia make a run for it, they won't follow.
They're more interested in me. Get to the police and bring them back here.
But...
Do as I say.
All right, Jones.
That's enough.
You and I will go for the coin.
Igor will remain here with the ladies in the event that...
Run! Hurry! Run!
Don't you want that coin?
I've got it!
It's in my pocket.
I've had it all the time.
You're lying.
Am I?
I've searched you.
Not well enough.
Well, if you really have i throw it to me.
With my hands like this?
Uh-uh. If you want it, come and get it.
Zotz!
Jones, I warn you.
I want that coin!
You'll have to take it!
May I remind you that you are now powerless?
Jones, I want that coin.
I'll give you till the count of three.
One...
Bates, listen.
No discussions, please.
Just the coin. Two...
I... I...
Three!
Zotz!
Amazing phenomenon,
Bates, isn't it?
Zotz!
Take your time, Igor.
Just take your time.
Wouldn't you know it?
Not a cop in sight.
Stop this silly game, 
Professor.
Give me the coin and no harm will come...
No!
Professor, don't be ridiculous!
You'll fall.
Don't worry about me.
Zotz!
Stop! Stop, I say!
Zotz!
That's it.
Zotz!
It's no use.
You are powerless without that coin!
Bates, I warn you.
(WHISPERING) The slightest noise or vibration...
What are your plans no w, Professor Zotz?
The name is Jones, young man.
Jonathan Jones.
And my plans are to return to Saracen Valley College on the next plane and begin my duties as the new dean of languages.
General Bullivar, do you think the coin will be recovered?
Well, it's hard to say.
It might have floated all the way out into the Pacific.
Needle in a haystack.
However, we're using maximum effort, radar, sonar, loren, submarines...
The newest type of magnetic devices.
Oh, modern science is a wonderful thing.
My personal opinion is that we stand an even chance of regaining the coin for the good of humanity.
What do you think, Professor?
Well, I agree with the general
I think the chances are excellent that the coin will be found.
Bye, General.
Thanks again for your hospitality
Thank you for overlooking the unfortunate circumstances of our first meeting.
That's a private joke, gentlemen.
Our congratulations again.
I know that you two are going to be very happy.
Goodbye, sir.
Come, Mrs. Jones
We have time for just one short visit before we catch the plane.
Visit? With whom?
Someone that we both should meet, I think
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye.
Gentlemen.
Goodbye, General
Bye-bye.
JONATHAN: Bye.
For once, Horatio Kellgore and I see eye to eye.
Zotz all!
I'd like another shot at that prize money.
Okay for next Sunday?
No, Jim. It ain't okay.
- Now, look, Bice, I know...
- No, you look.
All of my drivers are 18, 19.
You're too old for these kid snorts.
You're liable to get hurt in there.
You used to be a big track driver.
Ain't you got no pride?
I ran out of pride when
I ran out of cars.
Jim, you gotta look at yourself.
Okay, you start out all right.
You win a couple of tracks, you think you're on your way.
But it didn't work out, did it?
Much obliged.
You need any money?
Nope.
Hey...
What do you do with this stuff?
It's for a friend.
Hey, how'd it go?
Okay.
- I brought you something.
- Oh, thanks.
Oh, the poor thing.
I'll find a good spot for it.
You got hurt again.
- So?
- One of these days, you're gonna get wiped out entirely.
Why you gotta be a driver?
Maybe that's not your thing, racing.
How about all those car agencies down on Van Ness?
I bet that a top mechanic there gets a lot of good bread laid on him.
What is the matter with everybody?
Can't you understand?
I'm not a mechanic.
I'm a driver.
I know just how you feel, Jim.
Hey, I used to think that I was happy painting flower seeds.
Then one day, inside me, there was this little voice, says,
"Tennessee Steinmetz."
I said, "What?"
It said, "You ain't happy." Well, I...
Tennessee, would you tell me something?
Why is it the only thing we ever have in this house is parrot food?
I mean, we don't have a parrot.
Hey, eat that. That's good.
That's pressed kelp.
That aerates your liver.
Then this voice inside of me continued as follows...
"This is nowhere. You gotta make a new scene.
"You gotta change your bag."
That's when I split.
I went to Tibet, to a mountaintop with swamis and monks.
I discovered my real self.
It was wonderful.
I don't have to go to Tibet.
I know who I am.
I know what I want.
Hey, there are dirt track races at a carnival near
Bakersfield this week.
If I can get over there, I can pick up a couple of bucks.
Okay to use your wheels?
Yeah, okay, but I'm afraid you're gonna have a little trouble getting it started.
Where's the beast?
You didn't cut up the Edsel?
Came over me all of a sudden.
It was the only decent thing to do.
Believe me, Jim. It'll be happier up there.
Are you all right? Are you dizzy?
Oh, no. Well, there's a slight racking pain in my head.
Oh, I think you'd better sit down.
I'm really terribly sorry.
Well, it's not your fault.
I didn't mean to startle you.
Looks like you've been running into all sorts of things lately.
Yeah. Oh, oh, this is just a little...
Oh, lady.
Oh, really, sir.
Excuse me.
Over 400 cubes...
Dual quads, all synchro box, zero to 60 under five.
All right, Miss Bennett, I'll see to this gentleman myself.
May I be of service, sir?
I see that you're a person who appreciates fine things.
You're no doubt aware that this is the celebrated Thorndyke special.
And allow me to say, sir, that I think this car would suit you very well.
Yes. Yes, it would.
Yes, may I offer you a glass of sherry and a biscuit?
Go right ahead.
I take it that the question of price does not greatly concern a gentleman like yourself.
Oh, I wouldn't haggle, if that's what you mean.
What price range did you have in mind?
About $75.
I could go 80 in a pinch.
What do you have in the way of cheap, honest transportation?
Cheap, honest transportation.
I will bid you good day, sir.
Good day.
Hey.
Havershaw.
Now, where did this come from?
Mr. Thorndyke, yes, sir?
What is this thing doing in my showroom, may I ask?
Oh, I believe Miss Bennett may know something about this.
Yes, you remember when Mrs. Van
Luit purchased her new Bentley?
Well, she also requested us to buy a small used car for her upstairs maid.
Then why isn't her upstairs maid in her blasted vehicle?
The car was returned this morning, Mr. Thorndyke.
She was having some kind of difficulty with it.
- Get it out of here.
- Yes, sir.
What's that for?
I beg your pardon?
Why don't you let the little car alone?
Are you presuming to tell me what to do in my own establishment?
Okay, I'm outta line.
It just bugs me to see somebody abusing a decent piece of machinery.
Fascinating.
Well, now that we've had the benefit of your point of view, shall we regard our relationship as terminated?
Havershaw.
Get this eyesore out of my showroom.
And if ever I find it here again, someone is going to find himself in a great deal of trouble.
Yes, sir. Watch your knees there, boys.
Here we go.
Sorry. None of my business, is it?
Perfectly all right.
Goodbye.
Oh, goodbye.
Good morning.
Good morning. What do you want?
Police.
Right. What do you want?
Forgive me for pointing, but have you ever seen that car before?
No. No, I haven't.
Hey, he's a cute little fella.
Hey, wait a minute.
I think I saw that car at an agency yesterday.
Now permit me to inform you of the following.
First, say nothing that would jeopardise your constitutional rights.
Second, the minute that you get downtown,
I would advise that you get a good lawyer.
Shall we go?
Go? What for?
On suspicion of grand theft.
Look, now, wait a minute. There's something cock-eyed about this.
How did that little car get here?
I share your curiosity.
Shall we go?
I'll do it. Okay.
I'll do it, but I just want to go on record. I have seen some crummy stunts in my time used to sell cars, but this beats everything.
To plant this bug in the possession of an innocent man and then to accuse me of stealing it.
How dare you, sir.
Are you suggesting that I would stoop to such tactics?
That's exactly what
I'm suggesting.
In the first place, it might interest you to know that under normal circumstances,
I would never sell a car to someone with whom I'm not, well, shall we say, socially compatible.
Socially compatible?
Please, please, let's not go through that again.
I think we've worked it out very well.
Mr. Douglas needs a car, and for a very low amount down, and the usual monthly payments, the car will become his.
Very well, even though my personal inclination is to have Mr. Douglas tapped into jail, and this four-wheel contrivance dropped into the bay.
I think Mr. Thorndyke is being very fair.
Fair? It's not fair.
I'm being muscled.
I just want you to know that I know
I know it, and I don't like it.
I'll draw up the papers. Would you come with me, please?
Then get Mr. Douglas and his acquisition out of here before
I lose my temper.
What the...
What's the matter? You from LA or something?
Fine. I thought we'd run over to that new restaurant...
Have you gone mad?
Okay, what's the joke?
What do you mean?
I don't know how you rigged it, but I'm sure that car's a real cutup when a convention comes to town.
If I wanted a trick car, I would've bought one in a joke shop.
Allow me to say that I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
You come blithering up in that beastly little car, and assault my personal Rolls-Royce.
I brought it back.
I want my money,
I want the papers I signed, and then I'll get out of here, and you two clowns can have your little laugh.
Mr. Douglas, if there is anything wrong with the car, would you be good enough to tell me what it is?
There's nothing essentially wrong with the car.
It's just that it wants to go one way, and I'd like to go the other.
Whatever it is, none of it is covered in our gilt-edged guarantee.
Oh, I'm sure of that.
If you examine paragraph 12...
Excuse me, Mr. Thorndyke, but if I sold this gentleman the car,
I feel a certain responsibility.
Do you mind if I try it?
Miss Bennett.
Our dinner engagement.
I won't be a minute.
Seems to be acting all right now.
Sometimes new car owners have a tendency to exaggerate their problems.
We get that all the time.
Believe me, when I was in this car alone, it was...
Just treat it gently at first.
It really is quite a fine little automobile.
Have you had much experience with cars?
Look, lady, by profession,
I'm a racing driver.
Oh, that Jim Douglas.
What do you mean,
"That Jim Douglas"?
Let's see. Two years ago at
Laguna Seca, you spun out, and hung a beautiful Buick
Special on the back fence.
At Willow Springs... Was it a year ago last February?
You sprayed a Lotus all over the infield.
How do you know all that?
I have trouble with names and faces, but I never forget a car.
I like good machinery.
Now, why don't you give this little car a fair chance?
You bought it. Enjoy it.
You can drive me back now.
How about it, Dad?
Want to give that doodlebug a workout?
I'll go easy on you.
Be serious, will you?
Did you see this thing take off?
One of your showboat tricks, Mr. Douglas?
I tell you, I had nothing to do with it.
Hey, we were turning.
Out of sight, man.
I wouldn't have believed it.
Groovy, Pop. Groovy.
Well, as long as the customer finally seems pleased,
I'll just step out and find myself a taxi.
Will you stop the car, please?
I'm trying. Look.
It's just like I told you.
This thing's starting to act up again.
How very odd. When I was driving, there was no problem whatsoever.
I can't seem to do anything with it.
Mr. Douglas, I'm asking you nicely to pull over to that kerb and let me out.
Look, I'm sorry about your date. I really am.
I didn't want you to miss your dinner engagement.
What's the rush, tiger?
We got all night.
Goodbye, Mr. Douglas.
Here, I'll help you.
I can get out, thank you.
What'll it be, chief?
Oh, hey, look, we have a little problem here.
Would you mind helping the young lady get her car door open?
Look, I'm busy.
And furthermore, I ain't no mechanic.
All I do here is sell food, and that ain't too good.
You want something, or don't you?
- Help.
- Two hamburgers and a coffee.
Help.
Can you help me, please?
Help. I'm a prisoner.
I can't get out.
We all prisoners, chickie baby.
We all locked in.
A couple of weirdos, Guinevere.
What... Wait a minute, now.
Hold it, hold it.
Let me open the door.
Hey, knock it off, will you, sis?
I ain't saying this is the classiest joint in town, but we gotta draw the line somewhere.
Come on, back in your seat.
Why don't you go up to Seabreeze Point?
Fuzz don't bother you much up there.
Thanks.
I wish there was some way I could make up for those hamburgers.
Mr. Douglas, please don't go on about it.
I'm quite sure that if I were driving, none of these things would've happened.
It's all yours.
Now I think you'll see what's what.
This is very embarrassing.
Yes, it is.
I would've preferred knowing you a little longer first.
Just a minute.
You don't for one solitary instant dare to think that I drove you here on purpose?
Oh, don't try to explain.
The point is, you brought me here.
I did not bring you here.
It's this nasty little car.
But you said yourself earlier, it's a very nice little car.
And as you said before, it does have some peculiar traits, and I agree with you completely.
As a matter of fact, bring it in tomorrow, and I'll find a replacement for you.
I don't want the car replaced.
As a matter of fact, I'm beginning to like it.
Oh.
Don't panic, don't panic.
There must be some place
I can call a taxi.
Hey.
You know, for a moment there, I thought you weren't going to stop.
What's the matter now?
Hey, look, this is ridiculous.
Let's get back in the car, huh?
Hold it. Hold it, everybody.
Just a moment, please.
Something the matter?
Is this man bothering you?
No, not exactly.
It's okay, we're together.
Is that your car?
My...
Well, yes. Yes it is.
Okay, then. Move along.
- Hey, bud.
- Yeah?
Not too smart wandering around the park at night.
Right.
I'll drive.
She'll drive.
I should've given you a citation.
You ought to have enough sense to put your brakes on while your car is stopped.
Well, then if everything that you say about this car is true, it's already starting to happen.
What's starting to happen?
Us human beings.
We had a chance to make something out of this world.
We blew it. Okay.
Another kind of a civilisation is gonna take a turn.
Give me an 11 mil wrench, will ya?
I'm sitting up on top of this mountain, right?
Right.
I'm surrounded by these gurus and swamis and monks, right?
- Right.
- I'm looking at my stomach,
I'm knocking back a little rice wine.
Got some contemplation going.
I see things like they are.
I could have told you all this was coming.
What's coming?
Jim, it's happening right under our noses, and we can't see it.
We take machines, and we stuff them with information, until they're smarter than we are.
Take a car.
Most guys spread more love and time and money on a car in a week than they do on their wife and kids in a year.
Pretty soon, you know what?
The machine starts to think it is somebody.
I'm not saying that a mechanical thing, it can't be a friend.
Like, when I was broke one summer, there was this giant claw machine in the Sutro Amusement Park.
And it would grab cameras and watches, and drop them down a hole to me.
And I would hawk them and buy lunch.
- You follow me?
- Yeah, yeah.
I think you were up on that mountaintop too long.
Contrariwise, the traffic light down the street hates my guts.
I don't know why, but in the last six weeks,
I haven't caught anything but a stop signal.
And it makes me wait six seconds longer than anybody else. I timed it.
There's things like that happen to lots of other people, too.
But the other people, they don't tell no other people, because the other people would say,
Tennessee, that traffic light is a lot of nuts and bolts.
This little car, lot of nuts and bolts.
Everything explains itself one way or the other.
You're not listening to me.
Don't lose your grip, old buddy.
This little car didn't do one thing tonight that can't be explained in terms of short circuits, sprung doors, grabbing steering, worn knuckles...
Maybe some advertising gimmick.
I'll fix it.
I don't think you got the picture.
I got a beautiful picture.
This baby happens to have an extra turn of speed, which is the only thing I care about.
You don't understand what happens, do you?
They make 10,000 cars, they make them exactly the same way, and one or two of them turn out to be something special.
Nobody knows why.
I know why.
I may be kidding myself, but I think I can make something out of that sad little bucket of bolts.
Save these. They'll be famous someday.
I'm your friend.
Want to take a ride?
I want to check those adjustments I made last night.
- Okay.
- Be right with you.
Hey. Come here.
All right, you guys, get out of there.
Out. Come on.
Who do you guys think you are?
Stop clowning around, will you?
Play it straight.
Don't give him any trouble.
You could have a good home here.
What's all that racket?
- Nothing, nothing.
- Oh. Hop in.
What'd I tell you?
Now it handles good.
All the bugs are gone.
Herbie's all right.
Who's Herbie?
This little car, named after my Uncle Herb.
He used to box middleweight.
Preliminary mostly.
Gradually his nose got shaped more and more like to remind me of this little car.
Do you mind?
Whatever you say, Tennessee.
Herbie.
I'll take them.
Thank you, sir.
What's that for?
An oil job.
Huh?
I got a small knock in my conscience.
Thanks.
Now we get down to business.
You gonna race?
What do you think?
Oh, boy, won't Herbie love that.
Le Mans, Monte-Carlo, thrills, glamour, the roar of the crowd.
He really does drive.
If you could give me one good reason for bringing me down to this ridiculous desert...
Isn't that the scruffy little car we had in the shop?
Now we're going.
You're doing terrific, Herbie, but don't make it look too easy.
Play it smart.
Okay, Jim, go ahead.
You're raring now.
So who cares? I'll tell you one thing,
I certainly don't intend losing any sleep over that absurd car.
Come on. Come on.
Now, Herbie, now. Now.
The winner, number 53,
Jim Douglas, driving a class D special.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
- Good race, Jim.
- Thanks, Ray.
Oh boy, was Herbie ever great today.
Hey, I was out there, too.
Wouldn't you say that was a fair piece of driving?
Hey, I'm not trying to take anything away from you, but you gotta admit that this little guy backed you all the way.
Yep. It's a nice little car.
You know something else?
For the first time in a long while, I felt my real self out there today.
I mean, a sense of authority, like the top drivers have, you know?
I kind of felt you felt that.
Tennessee, I wouldn't admit this to anybody else, but I was beginning to think
I'd never be anything more than a piston-happy, lead-foot punk.
Then this starts to happen.
I'm glad for you, Jim.
You know that.
Well, hello.
I see you finally learned how to handle this car.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
What have you done to this thing?
Oh, an adjustment here, an adjustment there.
Do you want to sell it back?
I own most of it anyway, you know.
Still 23 payments to go.
Well...
I'll tell you what
I'll do. I'll take the car and give you $1,000 clear.
Now what do you say to that?
No. You don't want to do that.
It's all right, Tennessee.
I know what I'm doing.
I think Mr. Thorndyke is a little mixed up as to who or what won that race.
And what does that mean?
Someday I'll teach you not to confuse the car with the driver.
I should welcome the opportunity.
Mr. Thorndyke, I think that's a very good idea of yours.
What is?
You're racing in the Libra Open at
Riverside the end of the month, right?
Yes.
I'm sure that Mr. Douglas would like to get the remainder of his payments off his back.
No doubt.
But why should I think that's such a good idea?
Well, if Mr. Douglas entered the race, he could bet his share of the little car against the remaining payment.
What do you say, Douglas?
Winner to become the sole owner of the car.
A moment ago you mentioned teaching me a lesson.
Do I now detect a note of timidity?
Racing.
That's the name of the game, isn't it?
Win or lose, put up or shut up.
You got yourself a deal, Thorndyke.
Splendid.
The drivers' meeting is over.
Now the third race of the afternoon will get underway here at Riverside.
You keep your eye on your friend in the bug, my dear.
I'm going to squash him.
Clear the grid.
Clear the grid, please.
Can't help feeling yippie.
If anything goes wrong, we lose Herbie altogether.
I thought you were the guy with all the faith in this car.
Yeah, I got it, yeah.
And now the starter has his flag in the air.
The engines are started, and in just a moment we'll have the start.
All the cars looking very smart on the grid.
Drivers signify that they're ready to race with their hands extended in the air.
The flag is up, and there they go.
All cars getting off to a very nice start.
Off the grid on the way to turn one.
We'll see how they shape up as they go into turn one.
Cars stretching out now.
All cars off the starting grid and through turn one.
To the open now.
Down the backstretch, all by himself now.
Here is the number
14 car of Thorndyke going into the sweeper turn.
The rest of the field all stretched out as they charge down the backstretch.
Not yet, Herbie. Not yet.
The standings at lap 23...
Thorndyke still leading,
Lesser running second, and Erwin in third place.
Now, Herbie, now.
Now car number 53, Douglas, starts to make a move.
Picking up cars as he goes by car number 20, into the sweeper very hard and fast.
Going through traffic, passing number 23 now, is car number 53, Douglas.
He has just come alive and is making a challenge in this race.
Passing cars as he goes down the back-straight.
Car number 53, Douglas, making his bid.
Into the straight now is
Thorndyke, car number 14.
Now the pressure's on.
Douglas, number 53, is drawing close on Thorndyke in the number 14 car.
Douglas has just come alive and is pressing the leader now.
Now making his bid to pass but he can't get by.
He's being shut off by Thorndyke in the number 14 car.
Goes slightly off course, takes out some oranges, and apparently is out of control.
And goes crashing into the number four shut off card.
Thorndyke continuing on as the number 53 car left...
Now he's making his re-entry.
Look out.
Hey, nice going, champ.
Thank you very much.
Hey, what a champ. Way to drive.
Just a moment, Mr.
Thorndyke, you don't have...
I demand that this thing is impounded and checked.
I tell you, there's more going on here than meets the eye.
Mucha luck, señor.
Thank you.
A usted también.
You don't look well in these pictures lately.
How could I look well?
I haven't been able to sleep.
That rotten car is driving me piffy.
Has it occurred to you that it may not be the rotten car?
Perhaps it's the way
Mr. Douglas drives.
Balderdash. There isn't a driver in the world who can get that speed out of a car like that.
No, he's done something to it, and I've got to find out what.
You've become obsessed by this whole thing.
There are other cars, other races.
Why don't you just forget it?
My dear child, how little you know me.
Yes, Mr. Thorndyke.
Carole?
How long have you been with us?
A year and a half, almost two. Why?
You know, I'm afraid I've been a little remiss in not telling you long before now how very well you've proved in all your duties.
Well, thank you.
And Carole?
As I realise you have the best interests of this organisation at heart,
I want you to accede to a somewhat unusual request.
Oh?
Peter Thorndyke.
It's for you.
All right, you can take it here.
Thank you.
Yes, good afternoon.
Oh, I think that should be quite all right.
7:30 will be fine.
Yes, bye.
I think I'll...
I'd like you to see this Douglas fellow.
Get to know him.
Who knows? If he has the talents of which I believe him capable, perhaps we can give him the opportunity of joining our organisation, racing under our colours, but first we must know something about him.
- How about tonight?
- Very good.
At 7:30?
Very good. Why waste time?
Oh, and, Carole, another thing.
Leave your car.
Take the special.
He likes that one.
Thank you.
I think I ought to tell you that that was Mr. Douglas who just called.
Excellent. Strike while the iron is hot.
In all honesty, I should like to point out that I agreed to have dinner with him before you suggested it.
Well, I salute your honesty, my dear.
A quality not necessarily to be despised.
Thank you.
A very loyal girl.
Got Herbie all polished out for you.
Carole Bennett called back.
She's gonna pick me up in the special.
You mean you're not taking Herbie?
He's looking forward to some relaxation just like you are.
The car is...
See you later, Tennessee.
Some thanks after what
Herbie did for you.
Don't let it get you, Herbie.
Jim didn't mean it.
Don't forget, he isn't the first guy ever to lose his head over a bucket seat and a paint job.
He'll come to his senses.
Good evening.
Sorry, the other rats are out for the evening.
No, no, please.
I didn't come by to see Mr. Douglas.
I just came by to pay my respects to that gallant little car.
Huh?
There it is.
What a marvel it is, indeed.
I don't get you, fella.
Oh, come, come, sir, I know a rare bit of machinery when I see one.
And after all, who should know it better than I?
I, who have been trounced time and again by this paragon.
You will forgive me for saying so, sir, but it does take class to know when it has been defeated by class.
You know something, Mr. Thorndyke,
I may have misjudged you.
Well, thank you.
I've been misjudging a lot of people lately.
Would you like a drink?
Some Irish coffee?
Speciality of the house, my own mother's recipe.
That's very kind of you, I'd love it.
I'll be back in a jiffy.
Well, that's most kind.
Thank you so much.
It's just incredible, isn't it, to think that this innocent-seeming object is capable of such great deeds.
How, indeed.
The trick is, always remember to have asbestos gloves when you make coffee this way.
Definitely, yes.
Yes, quite fascinating.
Here we go.
Ooh. Oh. Oh...
How very refreshing.
Well, thank you.
Up the Irish.
To the little car, a gallant adversary, and may the best car win at Riverside.
- May the best car win.
- Yes.
Oh, that's very good, isn't it?
Very good, indeed.
Like it?
What do you think?
I can't stand that hungry look any longer.
Take over.
You know what I said to myself the first time I saw you?
What?
I said to myself, now, there's a real lady.
This is how it ought to be.
Me and these kind of wheels.
Excuse me asking, but aren't you doing all right with the little car?
Sure.
But can you imagine how I'd make it with equipment like this?
Is it so important to you?
Without a real car,
I'm only half a man.
What part of Ireland did you say your mother came from?
Coney Ireland.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I'm gonna make some more coffee.
Well, would you like a spot of this?
I like a spot of anything.
I'm so sorry.
Then we're gonna drink to Herbie.
Greatest little car in the whole world.
Yes, quite right. Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.
To Herbie.
To Herbie. I'm so sorry about your hand.
I do apologise.
Herbie.
What do you know?
The engine stalled.
How about that? Door's stuck.
That's how it is with cars sometimes.
Yes.
Guess we'll have to wait and see what happens next.
Well, as someone very wisely once said,
"That's how it is with cars sometimes."
I just said that.
Oh.
I wonder if your reputation is altogether true.
What's my reputation?
Oh, I've heard that Jim Douglas is only interested in fast cars and easy money.
Not true.
Oh?
You know something else?
What?
When the light hits you just right, you're as beautiful as General
Grant on the $50 bill.
Oh, dear me.
You want to know the secret of the little car?
I do, indeed.
I'll tell you the secret of the little car.
No, just a minute.
All right, tell me.
It's heart.
That's what it is... Heart.
Heart.
Yes, well, I'm certainly going to make a note of that.
Headache gone?
All gone.
Anticipation of victory is the purest form of aspirin.
This is my day.
Clear the grid.
Clear the grid, please.
You seem very confident.
You know, I believe I am.
There is some passing as they leave the starting grid.
Going for turn one.
Field stretching out now.
Everybody into the turn went very nicely.
Very fine field of cars here, and coming through traffic now, making a move is Peter Thorndyke in the number 14 car, picking up a few cars in that turn.
Now he comes by and picks up three more cars, going into the lead now.
Thorndyke leading this race in car number 14.
Now making a move is car number 53, Douglas, who also picks up about three cars as he goes charging into the traffic, and is in hot pursuit of
Thorndyke in the number 14 car.
As they go down the back-straight, coming on very hard to pass now and Douglas, number
53, making the pass.
Attaway, Jimmy boy.
Go, Jimmy. Ha, ha, ha.
So far Jim Douglas seems to have everything pretty much to himself.
He comes through the S's into turn six well in control.
As we come down the back-straight,
Douglas is slowing down and Thorndyke goes rocketing by into the sweeper turn.
It looks as though the Douglas car is having trouble.
Yes, number 53 is fading fast.
It is developing a problem of some kind.
Come in. Come in.
Come in.
Irish coffee.
I'll be here all night if necessary. Ha, ha, ha.
I can take any amount of this.
Right, there we are.
Don't worry, little guy.
You'll be home soon.
There we are.
Right, right you are.
Do you mind standing clear?
They want me on my own.
I'll see you in a minute.
Poor little fella.
You got a temperature.
Don't worry, Jim will be back soon.
He never would have left if it hadn't been something important.
I know, nothing worse than an Irish coffee hangover.
That you, Jim?
Mind if I come in?
Sure, come on.
I wouldn't blame you if you threw me out.
On account of what Thorndyke did?
How can I blame anyone?
Thorndyke ruined the little car right under my nose.
- Where's Jim?
- Don't know.
He went out as soon as we got back.
Didn't say a word.
Left Herbie and me flat.
Doesn't he take care of his car after a race?
Can you do something?
Like what?
Well, help the little car.
I'm not a mechanic, but
I think it's suffering.
Suffering?
Please.
Mind if I use those coveralls?
Right.
Oh, look, I want to tell you so you don't have to worry.
I'm not with Peter
Thorndyke any more.
I don't think his way.
Oh, I know that.
How do you know?
Well, Herbie wouldn't like you, otherwise.
Herbie wouldn't like me?
Miss Bennett...
I gotta level with somebody.
I can't talk to Jim.
Oh, it would destroy him.
You don't know what it was like before the little car came along.
Jim was defeated. It was murder.
He couldn't get a job.
He got into trouble.
Everybody was on his back.
Then Herbie came into his life.
You remember that day?
I remember.
Well, Jim started winning races again, he got his self-respect back.
What am I gonna do?
Tell him that it was Herbie winning those races, not him?
Was it Herbie?
Well, I...
You fix the little car.
I'll tell you what's going on.
I didn't know nothing.
Then I went to Tibet.
I plugged into this contemplation thing...
How's that sound?
Like the song of a bluebird.
Well, the fuel lines are clean, plugs are clean, wiring checks out.
Looks like we're in pretty good shape.
Herbie and I sure appreciate it.
You don't believe a word I said about this little car, do you?
Well, there's always a first time.
I imagine Adam thought woman was a pretty funny piece of equipment when he met Eve.
Well, that's a start.
You can't believe it all right away.
It takes time.
- Well, hello there.
- Hi.
What's this?
You ever see anything so beautiful?
Very nice.
What's the big idea?
You already got a car.
Not after what happened today I don't.
Ah, shut up. You want
Herbie to hear you?
Now don't start that again, Tennessee.
Look, the El Dorado is coming up.
There are real cars lined up in there.
I need something that can cut it.
Herbie's cut it so far, hasn't he?
Of course he has.
Now, hold it, you two.
I've done great with this little car so far, thanks to a few changes I made and, if you don't mind, some pretty fair country driving.
But I gotta stop kidding myself.
I need a big, strong car.
Now I got it.
Don't pay any attention.
Don't even look at it.
Hello?
Peter Thorndyke here.
Well, well.
Yeah, yeah, Thorndyke, I know what you did to my car.
You need your brains kicked out.
Well, you can imagine how I must feel.
You see, I'm simply not responsible when I've been drinking.
You know how it is.
Forget it. And goodbye.
Wait, wait, wait.
I understand from a friend of mine that you purchased a new Lamborghini today.
So?
I'm also informed that you owe a great deal of money on it.
Now, myself, for sentimental reasons, I like the little car, and I'm perfectly willing to increase my previous offer and give you $1,500 for it.
Now, immediately.
I'm in the vicinity.
Thorndyke, I don't like you.
But I can use your money.
You got yourself a deal. Come and get it.
What do you mean you got yourself a deal?
- I'm selling the little car.
- You're what?
Don't make a fuss.
I need the money.
You crumb. You can't do that to Herbie.
Carole, will you tell him how it is?
Out in the real world?
Me? Ha.
Well, near as I can figure it,
I'm not too smart either.
I get rid of one heel just in time to find another.
Well, now, what happened to you?
I thought you'd be on my side.
Not when you do something like this to Herbie.
Has everybody gone nuts around here?
I can understand how
Tennessee feels.
He's just in off a flying saucer. But you... I thought you made sense.
Something tells me it's very, very wrong to sell that little car.
Well, thank you for your opinion, but what am I supposed to do?
Now, I need the money.
Tennessee, if I don't sell...
Don't talk to me.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have butted in.
You're absolutely right.
As a matter of fact,
I don't know...
What are you doing here?
I wish I knew.
I really wish I knew.
If I weren't so young and innocent, a certain thought might enter my mind.
Such as?
Such as you went out with me last night so that Thorndyke could get a shot at the little car.
Is that what you think?
You gotta admit it's tempting.
Okay. Okay, you want to know what I was doing here?
Well, I felt sorry about what happened today.
So I quit Thorndyke and came over here like a full-grown idiot to find out if I could make up for it in some way.
Well, isn't that a beautiful thought for the day?
Very touching. Makes me glow.
I think it's just about time someone told you what the score is.
You see, Tennessee's too tender-hearted.
You really think it was you winning those races?
Yes, I think it was me winning...
What do you mean it wasn't me winning...
Pardon me.
All right. Do you want me to tell you something, my windbag friend?
I admit, I didn't believe it when Tennessee told me before, but now I see it makes all kinds of sense.
What?
That thimble head of yours has gotten all swelled up.
You're not winning any of those races.
You couldn't win a game of marbles from a 12-toed myopic rhinoceros.
Let me... Will you knock it off out there, Tennessee?
Can't hear myself think.
I'm not out there, crumb, I'm here.
Well, hold it down. I'll...
Well, then what's this noise?
No.
Stop it. Stop it. You don't know what you're doing.
Look. Look what it did to my car.
Okay, okay, maybe it was a little jealous.
Of course it's jealous.
It's always been jealous because I get credit for winning those races.
Go on. Realise what you're saying?
At a time like this, whatever kind of time it is,
I always say that money serves to ease the pain.
Good evening, my dear.
Here you are, sir.
$1,500 for the small car, just as I promised.
I note it's not in mint condition, but I am nothing if not always a man of my word.
What about 2,000?
It's the least I can do to help a fellow human at a time like this.
Shall we consider it a deal?
Yes.
$2,000 for that little beat-up car. Why?
Well, I suppose you could say I have a warm place in my heart for the dear little thing.
You don't have a warm place on your whole body.
What do you want it for?
You don't want it. I do. Take the money.
- You. You, too.
- There's no need to be abusive.
I'm simply trying to give you some money.
I don't want your money. What do you want the car for?
Well, I...
You believe it. You believe it, too.
Believe what?
Jim, it don't matter whether you believe Herbie or not.
Herbie don't believe in you no more.
What?
Well, where'd he go? Where is he?
Took off. What do you expect?
Well, come on, let's find him.
This is a private thing between the two of you.
Good luck.
Herbie.
Herbie.
A rum lot you've taken up with, my dear.
You better find that car before I do, my friend.
Operator.
Mobile KQX2942,
I want 567-3998.
Havershaw? I shall require the personnel of both our day and night shifts.
We have a small task to perform.
Herbie.
Herbie.
That's it.
Herbie.
Excuse me.
Havershaw, tear it apart.
All right, boys, you heard Mr.
Thorndyke. Tear it apart.
I'm gonna find out what makes it tick.
- After it.
- After it.
Go on, grab the brute.
Hang onto it, you fools. Hang on.
Herbie.
Give me police station.
Hello. Police station.
Herbie.
Hey, you.
Did a little car come by here?
Yeah, just did without paying the...
No, Herbie. Don't.
Herbie.
Herb. Back up.
Herbie?
Come on, baby, it's gonna be a beautiful day tomorrow.
Oh.
Herbie, give me some help.
Herb?
I can't hang on much longer.
Boy, was he lucky.
This little car saved his life.
What do you mean, the car saved his life?
That's what it looked like for a moment there...
You know how funny things can look in the fog sometimes.
I think you've been up on that
Haight-Ashbury beat too long.
Swing that light over here.
Aha.
- What's that thing?
- It's a dried squid, Sergeant.
- Here's the damages.
- Can you pay it?
I'm sorry. I have no money.
Then your car will be impounded.
My guess is, the judge will order you to sell it at auction and the proceeds given to Mr. Wu.
Wait a minute.
May I please speak to the gentleman, please?
I spent some time up on a Chinese-type mountain teaching English to some of them.
You taught English?
Let's don't get personal. It's a matter of talking their language.
You have a little feel for tradition and some courtesy, you'd be surprised.
You can unscrut the inscrutable.
Go ahead.
Ah...
- Herbie?
- Herbie.
Oh.
Oh. Things are shaping up.
He's a car buff.
Good, good.
Wow.
- What's the matter?
- We just got a new problem.
He likes the car so much he wants to keep it.
Okay, the car is his, but he has to let me drive it in the El Dorado.
Now, if I win, tell him he gets to keep the prize money, but he has to sell Herbie back to me for a dollar.
Now you speak my language.
Attention, drivers and owners, report to Mr. Granatelli at the president's headquarters.
Further, you must remain on the secondary roads, which have been posted for this race.
Other than that, we've tried to reduce the rules to a minimum.
Instead of all this technical mamby-pamby there's so much of today, we're putting the emphasis on speed, endurance, and courage.
The way it used to be.
As you know, this is open formula racing.
Anything goes.
Any style of car and crew you wish.
The object, gentlemen, is to win.
I wish you all the very best of luck.
Tang Wu, I understand that you are the new owner of the Douglas car.
As I, too, am interested in the vehicle,
I took the liberty of looking you up.
Thank you.
You will therefore forgive me, sir, when I say that you are perhaps not quite as naive as you look.
In point of fact, you are a very shrewd operator, one who has managed to acquire, by one means or another, legitimate means, of course, a number of varied enterprises.
It is truly written, one cannot lose them all.
In the light of this, would you entertain a sizeable wager on the outcome of the race?
Wager?
The goddess of fortune will always find me her most ardent suitor.
Splendid, splendid.
Shall we step in here?
A little more private.
You're Mr. Thorndyke. I've always wanted to meet you.
You've heard of me? How charming.
Are you not the gentleman who originated the idea of small print on bottom of automobile sales contract?
The very same.
A most worthy adversary.
You are most kind.
And now, sir, the terms of our wager.
What would you like?
What have you got?
Ahem.
Okay, let's mount up.
How's our little friend?
I hope it holds together.
Holds together?
It was so beat up, I had to cut the frame to straighten it out.
Excuse me.
Is this the morning bus to Fresno?
Thorndyke, this little car goes so fast, we need three people inside just to hold it on the ground.
Well, you certainly picked the right crew.
Toodle-oo.
Break a leg, Thorndyke.
Havershaw, I trust you've not been wasting your time.
Spent a few useful moments with the small car?
Yes, sir.
Based then on what you now know, what would you say are the chances of victory for the Douglas car?
I would say that they range from slight to impossible.
Havershaw, you are a rat after my own heart.
Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
You're giving it a nice ride.
Okay to uncurl my toes now? We past everybody?
Everyone but Thorndyke.
Let's go to work.
They're coming up on us, sir.
Well, we're not too concerned, are we?
Now, Havershaw, aren't we coming to that rather dangerous, oily spot in the road?
Coming right up, sir.
Come on, push.
Push, you worm.
Jim, that's water.
Here we go.
Mr. Thorndyke, that isn't me.
Give me something to wipe my goggles.
Havershaw, did you ever think of having a manicure?
There they are.
Now watch me blow them off the road.
Who's the guy in the fur coat?
This is no time for eating, you fool.
Where are we? How far is Chinese Camp?
What's the matter with you?
Don't you even know how to open a map?
At the moment, the leaders of the race are approaching the historic mining towns of the mother lode.
In first position, as he moves past checkpoint three, is Jim Douglas.
Peter Thorndyke, in the special, has regained his relief driver and is rapidly making up lost ground as the two pacemakers near the famous old mining community of Chinese Camp.
- Now what?
- I don't know.
We can't be out of gas this soon.
Here.
Wait a minute. I got a suspicion.
What's the matter?
Just as I thought... Water.
They did it again.
Now what do we do?
Give me the map.
All right, it looks like Chinese
Camp's about three miles from here.
Now, if we come down the...
Hey.
What goes?
No sweat, man.
This is Uncle Wu's car.
You don't think he'd let anyone put it down, do you?
Easy, fellas.
The Jim Douglas car appears to have run into trouble.
There has been no sign of him past checkpoint nine.
Peter Thorndyke is refuelling at Chinese Camp.
Come on, come on, will you? I'm in a hurry.
Sure thing. I tell father.
My father say hurry is waste.
Waste is cracked bowl, which never know rice.
I don't care how cracked your father's rice bowl is.
What I want...
Hey. Some of you people get over here right away.
Okay, you're on your way.
Hooray. Hooray.
I'm getting out of here.
Not full. Can't go yet.
Oh, just you watch me.
As we come to the midway point in the first day's racing,
Peter Thorndyke, after a delay at Chinese Camp, is beginning to catch up with the rest of the field.
That knocked him off the
Christmas tree, sir.
This is our kind of terrain from here on out, all downhill.
How true it is that the best ways are the simplest ways after all.
That's what I always say, sir.
Oh, shut up.
We should be coming soon to what is either a rail tunnel or a bridge.
Oh, here's a tunnel.
That must be it.
What are you doing?
It's an elevator.
But Herbie doesn't fit.
Everybody out.
No sign of them.
You may open the wine now, Havershaw.
It's chilled the way you like it, sir.
All right, give me a hand.
Altogether now.
To you, sir. My unbounded admiration.
Thank you.
You know something about champagne, sir?
Havershaw, if you tell me that the bubbles tickle your nose,
I shall probably kill you.
Eek.
Get rid of that slop.
Shouldn't that wheel have come off by now?
It's long overdue, sir.
I'm terribly embarrassed by the delay. I don't know what...
Stop whimpering.
I'll just give them a friendly nudge.
Hey, where'd that wheel come from?
Hold it.
All right, don't do anything sudden.
Is it all right if I just cry real soft?
Carole, put your feet back here on the bumper.
Now give me your hand.
Let go, let go. Give me your hand.
I'm trying, but my mind don't get the message.
Come on, come on.
Now come right over the top.
Atta-boy.
All right, let's get the spare wheel on and get Herbie back on the road.
Thorndyke again.
He made a pizza out of it.
And now, here in Virginia City, the terminal point for the first day of the El Dorado, we're all looking down the road from the west.
And, actually, at any moment now, we should be seeing the car that will complete the first half of the El Dorado, the run for the gold.
Up in the judges' stand, the judges and the timers are ready.
Just a moment.
The first car is coming in sight right now.
He is really flying down the road.
And there he goes by us.
You making it all right, Tennessee?
Waah.
Whoa.
Stop, Jim, will you?
Waah.
Now, don't anybody breathe.
Ready?
Actually, at this hour, only one car is unaccounted for.
There's been absolutely no word of the Douglas special, which figured so very prominently in the early stages of the race today.
Well, I see the judges are closing down for the night, and, by golly, so are we, but we'll return to the El
Dorado at 7:30 tomorrow morning to bring you the start of the second and the final lap back to Yosemite Valley.
Good night, everyone.
A little bird's nest soup never hurt anyone.
Thanks.
Oh, thanks.
I hope this holds together. I'm putting welds on top of welds.
Mr. Wu, the wiring is mostly all burned off.
The cylinder walls are scored.
The carburettor is a mess.
The body's sprung.
This little car ripped itself to pieces trying to get us here.
It gave us everything it's got.
Now, maybe we could patch it back together,
I don't know, but...
How can I send it back into that rat race tomorrow?
It's got nothing left to give.
It's your car.
What do you say?
A wise man once said...
"When you come to last page,
"close the book."
You let that little car get under your skin, didn't you?
I don't know.
There's a lot of gloop been written about it.
The bond between a man and his automobile and how he hates it sometimes, mostly, how he loves it.
Showers gifts on it in the way of accessories and all that.
He gets hysterical if somebody scratches the paint or makes it lose face on the freeway.
Maybe some of those feelings got into the machinery, I don't know.
Tennessee thinks so.
Don't you?
There is something real about that little car, something that doesn't even have a name.
What I don't understand is, out of the millions of people in the world, why it picked a dog-eared second-rater like me.
You stood up for it once.
I guess it thought you were worth belonging to.
I understand that.
Ah, Douglas.
Didn't mean to disturb you.
We'll just take the car and go.
Take the car? What are you talking about?
I understand that you are out of the race.
What does that have to do with you?
Speaking as the new owner of the car, I regard your question as impertinent.
I'm going to hoist it up and drag it out.
Hold it.
Who said you were the new owner of the car?
Perhaps Mr. Wu would like to explain how he wagered the car on the outcome of the race.
Even as you, I believed in the little car.
I thought it would win.
More honestly, I could not resist the odds.
Thank you.
Good sir, would you say that this is a compact car?
You do not answer.
Well, let me tell you that you have never seen a compact car until you see what I'm going to do with this.
Mr. Douglas, I have a friend with a claw and hook auto wrecking company in San Francisco, and he's going to work on your car.
Maybe he'll transform it into a birdbath.
Or what about a nice doormat so I can wipe my feet on it every day?
Well, it's too bad this thing doesn't have the gumption to get up to the starting line this morning.
I should've enjoyed beating it.
Oh.
Why, you...
Take your hand...
Get your hands off.
Ooh.
Stop. Herbie, stop.
Hey, you know something?
Small car very angry.
And very strong.
The strength of 40 horses.
What do you think about that race coming up?
You know... I think now is chance to remove egg fu Yung off face.
Well, this morning, the second and the final lap of the El Dorado, from Virginia City to Yosemite, the run for the gold.
Out there, we see in first position and all ready to go,
Peter Thorndyke in his
Thorndyke special.
Don't worry... Hey.
Whoa.
These mechanics have done a real fine job in keying these engines up.
Come on, baby.
Come on, save it for the race.
One more foul-up like this,
Douglas, you're disqualified.
It seemed to be trying to get at us, sir.
Of course it was, Havershaw.
It's no use trying to blink the fact.
It's either us or it this time.
We're now getting reports from our checkpoint number 14, and this one tells us that the Thorndyke car is still holding first position at this time.
And while here in Virginia City, we're preparing to dispatch the last of our contestants.
That would be the Jim
Douglas special.
Hang tight. This may be a fast take-off.
Now.
Good stuff, Herb.
No more shortcuts like that last one, Jim.
Oh, this won't be anything like that last one.
Thorndyke.
Nice going, Herbie.
We've almost got him.
Hooray.
What fool laid out these streets?
But you're driving superbly.
Hey. You got something against driving on the streets?
Any sign of them?
Not a glimmer, sir.
Very well, then.
Now I've finished being generous George.
He's moving up.
There are times like this when I really don't like myself very much.
What happened to it?
I'd say it's gone for that last big lube job up yonder.
Ow. Ow.
Whoa.
Here it comes again, sir.
Havershaw, I am not a cowardly man, but I am beginning to sense that that thing is out to get me.
Now, none of that, sir.
We're not losing our nerve, are we?
Blast you, Havershaw. How dare you patronise me.
I am not losing my nerve.
No, sir. No, sir. Of course not, sir. No, no.
I think Herbie did something to himself that last fall.
What do you mean?
Well...
Like maybe he won't hang together much longer.
Yeow.
What happened to Thorndyke?
I don't know. It was like he disappeared.
Do you hear something?
Sounds like one of the cylinders.
That's impossible. The cylinders are in the back.
That's a point I find puzzling.
Get me out of here.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Get that side.
Oh. Ooh.
Here. Turn him around.
Okay, on your way.
Let's go.
Havershaw.
The leaders have now passed the final checkpoint.
We're now moving outside and we should be seeing them at the finish line in a very few minutes.
The word is the Douglas car is in the lead, but the Thorndyke car is moving up.
Oh. I think we got a problem.
Carole, turn around.
Grab hold of that strap and pull.
Ooh.
You okay?
Fine.
Look. There's another one.
I got it.
What goes on?
Just keep driving.
Try not to think about what I'm doing.
Well, that's that.
Yaah.
I can't weld that.
Give me your hand.
What are we gonna do, jump?
- No, pull.
- Why?
Whoa.
Whoa. Jim, help.
I think you better stop before someone gets hurt.
No dice. Herbie doesn't want to stop.
There it is.
I'll bomb the thing off the road once and for all.
Rotten sportsmanship, if you ask me.
Here at the finish, we're still waiting for our first glimpse of the leaders.
Yes. Yes, there they are.
The Thorndyke car now seems to have a slight edge on the Douglas car, which is hanging right in there.
You have him now, sir. Don't falter.
I'm not going to falter, you dimwit.
Good-o, sir, good-o.
You can't lose.
You can't possibly lo...
- We won. We won.
- Ha, ha, ha.
The little car takes first...
And third place.
Whoa.
Come on. Give us a picture.
Beautiful. One more.
What? Kiss? You better believe that.
- Oh.
- Come here.
"Couldn't lose," I think you said.
I don't like to remind you, sir, but if only you'd read the terms of that stupid wager you made with Mr. Wu.
Havershaw, you're despicable.
Havershaw, I shan't pretend I don't know what you're thinking.
However, I pride myself on being a good judge of character, and when I ask myself,
"Could this man be capable
"of such an act of pettiness and base...
"Base ingratitude." I accept that as your answer.
Ha, ha...
Thanks, Herbie. So long, Mr. Wu.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Wu.
- Bye, Tennessee.
- So long, Jim.
It's none of my business, but where are you going on your honeymoon?
We don't know. Herb hasn't told us yet.
Let's go, Herb.
Goodbye, Herbie.
The lowland gorilla, the largest and most powerful primates
Survives deep in some jungles of Tropical Africa
Confined to the most isolated and inaccessible places.
His outstretched arms reach a length of 2.5 meters
And their average weight round 270 kilograms.
The gorilla in its natural state is remains an enigma for us.
Know, yes, living grouped in family clans...
And they spend most time on the ground.
At night climb trees
Whose leaves and branches construct a kind of very comfortable nests.
Despite what could make us believe their dentures large canines...
Gorillas are strict vegetarians.
Their habitat provides them with abundant food.
They especially like the wild fruit, wild berries
And the most tender parts of tropical plants ,
Extracting smoothly thanks to his deft hands.
The adult gorilla has no predator preys or to any species.
The babies stay with their mother for many years ,
What constitutes the best protection against potential predators
.
The image of an angry gorilla is a truly terrible sight.
The predator is opposite a mass of muscle and teeth
Throwing terrifying growls and swats his powerful chest.
Leonie!
Hi, Leslie.
Leonie, sit next to your father.
You know you do not like to drive.
- You're not nervous. true?
- Does not matter.
Leonie?
Leonie!
Leonie!
Delt Lady, could you explain to the court did exactly what her husband?
- Shaved my dog.
- He shaved your dog... How?
- Drew on his back the hammer and sickle.
- The hammer and sickle...
- And what breed was the dog?
- A poodle.
Is it necessary to enter into these details?
Well, somehow her husband trying to offend you...
And so, undoubtedly mistreated the poor animal
Who obviously he hated.
Morgan loves animals!
It was me who was angry.
I hope the court realize that it is a desperate woman.
- Leonie, you remember Wally?
- Oh yeah. The great champion wrestler.
Wally is a good friend.
Meet Morgan since I was a kid.
- Yes Since I was so...
- was sure to come
And would face, but I've seen it continues as usual.
Morgan has not yet assumed the divorce...
I know my son. I want it.
Why he not come to me?
I have you prepared your room, you know?
- Are you all right?
- Only he sent a postcard from Greece.
I wonder what he has lost in Greece
To you loves you, Leonie.
You're the only one who can control
That says it.
His only true love.
Today Morgan is not right.
Is worse than yesterday...
Man is born to suffer.
Come on. Hurry, Leonie...
I tried to do everything what I could.
Yes... I'm sure.
Come see us at the bar always you like, okay?
Yes, I will go.
- Leonie...
- I'm coming!
- Goodbye, Wally.
- Bye dear.
These people are not used to waiting.
- I wish I had followed with Leonie.
- Of course.
Do not even occur you away, Wally...
These bourgeois bought their car by the sweat of the workers.
Good.
Morgan!
What?
- Hello.
- What are you doing here...
-... Instead of being in Greece?
- I returned yesterday.
Do not you remember our agreement
? You promised!
Bah... In Greece there was more a heap of ruins.
And I think I know why you insisted both it was there.
It was like a coded message.
As I arrived I realized.
I had to be here with you
To prevent your life from becoming also in disaster.
Is your own insecurity which infuriates you.
But quiet... Still, I love you.
You said you'd be out until everything was over.
You wanted to keep me well away while you were wearing forward
The separation process putting the law on your side.
Well, no... Lucky for you.
I decided to go back with you.
Why are you doing reforms in our house without consulting me?
It's my home.
I'll turn it into two apartments
And I'll rid of thousands of junk.
Beginning  so there.
I think I also have a say here.
It's too late, Morgan.
Did you know that someone has tried to demolish my study?
We have divorced this afternoon.
- And how have things gone?
- It was all very simple.
In just twenty minutes they have passed sentence.
Charles Napier is living here with you?
Leave me alone once, Morgan.
Why?
God!
And take your damn things!
There are two brushes his teeth in the bathroom!
And one of them is not mine...
Not even yours!
And since when you use hair pomade
Or is that Napier has wanted to mark their territory
Rubbing his greasy head off the walls?
I can smell it!
Today I went to see a psychiatrist.
If you want money, I think that I
20 pounds in the bag.
She was fat. And very hairy.
Hairy hands... furry furry clothing...
All.
That reminds me I'll shave and to take a bath. Salt, please.
Do they have the body filled with festering sores?
Or is the feeling of guilt?
Why such modesty? We are married.
What we were.
It occurs to me leave trip a few days
And you miss you in my arms a dirty art dealer.
I get bored.
Get bored! Here is the confession of a shattered soul of a ruined life...
My life... My life is fine.
May be yours, dear.
I think not started to love myself really
Until told you not want to live with you.
Do you know that the use of violence in relations between husband
And woman is not well seen?
Look... There's my duck.
We bought in Camden Town.
Is a duck Camden Town.
It is full of water.
No quacks well.
When are you going to leave me alone?
Come on, get in here.
Who's stopping you?
Well... you asked.
Damn treacherous wife!
Here I go!
I'm waiting for Charles!
It will come in a minute!
It is about to arrive.
- We can not...
- Why not?
- We're divorced.
- I disagree.
And Charles...
Charles Napier, besides being physically unpleasant
Is a moron
And useless from the genetic point of view.
Morgan...
The bathwater! doing to the idea.
I'm back with you to stay.
I do not want you.
I like seeing you like this...
Hot, moist and rosy as a cooked lobster.
Everything returns to normal.
I'm not so sure.
Already you not remember what happened in the studio?
No witnesses.
Witnesses do not lack.
- I want to go with you.
- Do not?
Is useless... You want me.
And I feel good.
Do you really going to go with that slicked little guy?
Really?
I like this house.
- It is the place where I live.
- Where you lived.
What about my work?
What work? Eighteen months ago pints or not a damn picture.
This time you'll go forever.
Do I have nowhere to go.
I'm living in the car.
My lawyer will contact you to me it back.
- Is our car.
- Bought with my money.
I told you I've been psychiatrist now?
He has advised you to give me back the car
No... I'm talking about something very serious.
Yes... Also you seem serious until you know.
I said that I am very ill.
Go...
So that still makes it easier to live with you.
My fantasies...
What a novelty!
The truth is that I perfectly fine.
You know?
I have the impression that my mental state is
Clearly illegal.
Morgan...
What the hell?
What are you doing?
Morgan, what are you doing?
My God!
- You're spoiling food...
- It's food Napier.
I do not care what happens to you...
I want you out of here now!
Please, get me
Mr. Wood... It's very urgent.
Tell him called Leonie Delt.
I need to talk to him.
Hello, Mr. Wood...
'm Leonie Delt.
Oh yes, yes... Thank you.
The judge behaved beautifully.
I'm calling because my ex-husband is here and refuses to leave...
Yes, here still... When I returned home this afternoon I found me inside.
I would like someone to come...
- I told him that the court...
- I'm ready...
Clearly it stated that he could not return to the house.
Now... This is something that can only be done
With great care and great skill.
Yes, I understand.
But I do not just...
Send the police!
Yes! Send in the police!
It's trashing the house!
I need police protection!
Why not?
The court's decision is perfectly clear...
Yes, thanks...
Goodbye.
Morgan...?
Morgan...?
Freeze! I wear a gun!
Charles Napier,
I will not allow you to sleep with my wife!
I do not like.
Forming makes strange images in my head.
Hello, Morgan.
I see you're back.
I do not know the
Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert...
How are you?
I'll blow your head that slicked!
- And I'm going to talk business...
- Business?
Excuse me... There are people willing to pay thousand pounds for a painting of yours.
And now collects this...
Come with me.
Geoffrey...
Anyway, I am determined to kill cruelly
Of course, Morgan.
Is a friend of Mr. Napier.
I imagined you would not hold out long
Take a brandy.
Come... We are civilized people.
I do not like civilization ..
It makes us lose the instincts.
- Your ex-wife has already decided.
- I warn you... I'm dangerous.
I'm determined to kill you!
Nonsense!
Well, as I was saying... When begin to paint again?
I can not do it.
You're overreacting, Morgan.
I was loaded!
Feel a kind of bitter aftertaste in the throat , right?
It's scary...
When you get so aggressive
I can not possibly take seriously.
Where has led me love?
Where kindness?
You know? In a man in love, the violence has a certain dignity...
And I'm full of love.
So I'll break face with a lot of love...
Where do you prefer to receive my love?
Between the eyes or teeth?
The Gilbert are interested in you, sir
. They thought I heard a shot.
This has been...
I'll be right there.
No more toys wear these, right?
Okay... Have another drink.
Trust me, you could use out with some girl.
What are you doing?
Geoffrey You scare.
Just missing that over reputation perjudicases my gallery
It is ridiculous to come here to talk about Leonie
Besides, you're the reason she left you and come with me.
She is faithful by nature.
True you say? A little more and it would be...
You're talking about women with which I'm going to marry!
- You marry her for her money, admit it.
- Sure, of course.
You do not understand Leonie.
He married me because I brought him insecurity, uncertainty...
You can never give that and she will end up hating you.
Look, Morgan, it's all much simpler
Leonie loves me.
Let's get married.
You need to take it.
She has left you.
Now is my girl.
Where the hell is he?
Charlie, Jack!
Look in the basement!
Quick!
It has to be here somewhere...
Here it is!
That back!
Here!
Now I have you!
Get out!
I'll go for you!
You are done!
Your father placed the red flag on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.
- Are the potatoes?
- Yes
It was something memorable.
- Right, Wally?
- Of course.
- Do you remember?
- Of course.
He even went and mounted police mounted a fat well...
- I was with him.
- In front...
In the forefront.
Workers, with workers.
Remove this.
But you do not...
You wanted to find a rich woman
And live luxuriously, as an operator bourgeois.
Leonie is my wife, mom.
Your father caló you perfectly that day drowned the kittens...
Know we could not have them, they were a useless burden.
But you did not want to kill them.
That was a cruel thing, you said.
Your father looked at me and said , very seriously...
I said, "I know that the child has given birth is mine"...
"But I have the impression that has given birth to a bourgeois cursed".
When I think of me working here as a mule...
And you, while...
Look at me!
Gorda as a whale...
I'm a worker.
These are not the hands of a marquise.
Why do you say that Leonie still your wife?
She said you were divorced.
He told your mother.
One of these days you will see me with a straitjacket.
For him, divorce no great importance.
It's like a game...
Look at me... I'm a poor man.
Do you know what a straitjacket, Mom?
Course.
I have lived all these years in a tucked.
Oh, my son...
These feet are killing me.
Already having age
'll stop working, Mom.
I'll come back here with you.
And I'll get a job.
So you can rest from one once and for all, Mom.
It will not happen!
Someday you'll be a famous painter, Morgan.
If you persevere...
In any case, I no longer live long time.
Come, now eat it all.
Come on.
- Wally...
- What?
- Have soiree tonight?
- Not because?
I'm taking the car
Leonie.
You'll end up forcing her to report you to the police.
I have to keep ahead, Wally.
- Until something stop you...
- Quiet, Wally.
I have to move on.
- This is not the way out.
- You forgive.
- Gorilla...
- What does it say?
- There is nothing to fear...
- But what the hell...?
Gorillas are good.
Big, yes... But good.
Do you keep ticket?
Good morning...
It's 6:30. We give way to George
Chalbert with Agricultural News.
Good morning.
Data do last weekend
That price developments oscillate depending on the sector.
So while the price of beef cattle no variation,
The pig has dropped to 27% in the auction of Newcastle.
In rashers of...
What is all this?
This car is an island of sanity
Amid a world of pain and madness
I am an exile who only expects a coup ice ax.
Know who I mean with ice ax beat, right?
Here it is... Trotsky.
I got right here.
The birth of the scalp
Leon Trotsky...
One of the architects of the Russian Revolution
Creator of the Red Army.
Great revolutionary ideologue !
Right there it nailed!
Joe Stalin
Trotsky started outside the Motherland.
He spent 17 years in exile.
But that was not enough for the old Joe
He wanted Trotsky killed.
Note ...
This is Trotsky.
This is the ice ax.
Mexico, on a hot day...
Stalin's agent is introduced
Trotsky's house
Impersonating one of his friends.
Enters the office where the great man is.
Trotsky is sitting at his desk...
Stealthily, the murderer
Is located behind him and...
Now how the hell I'm going to boil?
You can take Poached.
- Is your car, sir?
- No.
Oh... I see.
I rented, borrowed or stolen?
It Is my wife...
You can ask her.
- Lives there.
- Take note.
Although it is now out.
With her lover.
No... I do not care about tomorrow.
Because I love you, I love you...
How I love you...
Do not like how I sing?
... Thank you
Very friendly.
Are you wonderful.
I am very happy.
Our love is like a hurricane...
ROARING...
Leonie! Sit down!
Let's see... What he did before
With shaving brush
It could be considered contempt for authority, technically speaking.
Is there anything in life that is not contempt for authority...
Technically speaking?
Birth... Sex...
Work... Life...
Death.
- Will you give too many turns.
- Yes, I know.
But no use.
Shit!
- Come in, quickly.
- Is there?
I do not see...
We will not allow that encamp in the door of your house. No.
- Of course.
- Dammit!
- A I do not care...
- But not me!
Come, come inside.
It's there!
I'll crush that greasy head, Napier.
- And carries a mace truth!
- What? due to be waiting all night.
If you want you stay with me before you must fight with him, you know?
Fight?
Sure... And the winner will stay with me
. I am the prize!
I'm waiting for you to decide , Napier!
Come on! Be hard on it!
Prove who is stronger!
- Damn!
- You will end up hurting Morgan
This time I'll finish you, Napier.
- Is that your wife's lover?
- Yes...
And it has been my club.
Get back here!
I'm back...
Morgan, this is not right.
Why?
I can not take anymore.
I do not want to be with you.
I made a decision.
Stay the car if you want.
But leave me alone once.
You know I do not know how to drive.
- But I know what you need.
- What?
A cup of coffee.
- Yesterday I saw my mother.
- If?
- How are you?
- Still no "desestalinizarse".
I also saw the other day.
Still soldiering, in their bar Tinsley Road...
I'm a bad son.
What do you think?
Is it genetic?
Or is England?
Only you.
You know?
Having a garden is fine...
To fill it with flowers,
... And small bottles of whiskey children.
Nothing  small Napier!
Only small Delt!
- Actually it's like Stalin.
- Who?
Napier.
Insidious Cunning ...... ready to pounce on its prey.
Smiling politely as sharpens the knife will stick.
I calé from the beginning.
Always on the lookout to catch.
But I do not think leave into exile, you know?
No...
I not want to end up with an ice pick nailed in the head.
Send his assassins after my tracks
Because while I live, never be sure of his victory.
Do not you realize that I being alive, you will never be yours at all?
No...
What you have not thought about my children?
Who are you going to have my children
Would you be able to let a
Napier grow in your stomach?
Really?
I'm going to marry him.
I notice something here.
The words also are stuck...
I'm tired.
- I'm going to bed.
- With me?
Good morning, ma'am.
- Can we get married again?
- No way!
Good morning.
I'm going to make that damn car here are worn.
What? Do you believe Me Now?
That's my car!
Stop right there!
For you it's just a car...
But for me it is a home!
Right back!
I'm here!
I'm back!
I told you coming back.
- For the record, you asked...
- What is this?
... And violence is met by violence.
Is there anybody home?
Hello, Morgan. Pretty flowers!
They are for me?
Hello, Morgan.
What are you?
I'm pulling.
Under that shell, you're being a good boy, Morgan...
What are you talking about, Mom?
- I have agreed.
- Yes
- You always were taking free this afternoon...
- It's the great anniversary.
- And we were both at the cemetery.
- You see, Alice?
Your father always said the same thing...
Just have to wait...
Wait and be patient.
Until the great collapse and our opportunity.
And we, Morgan, we live to view it.
- To see what, Mom?
- Oh, Morgan... Revolution!
Let me flowers.
You sit and rest.
Your father loved come here.
Always he dreamed of spending by arms to the Royal Family
Abolish the institution of marriage and ensure that the children of workers
They had an equal education than the children of the bourgeoisie.
Yes... It was an idealist of good, your father.
Yes... I remember.
To me they are a very beautiful ideas , Morgan.
- Also me, Mom.
- Sometimes it does not.
Philosophers have always tried to understand the world
But the real problem is how to change it.
That is very true, Morgan.
Morgan!
Have some respect!
What?
Sorry, Mom.
I'm not disrespecting you, Mom.
Already more to continue doing those things, Morgan.
Accursed feet!
- You're not happy, are you, son?
- Leonie No, no.
- Yesterday I went to see a psychiatrist.
- Are you serious?
Yes. That's what I need.
A specialist in mental illness.
- What did he say?
- You need treatment.
What kind of treatment?
Electroshock and all that?
No... I just lie down me and tell me what is happening.
- See if you become a man.
- I hope so.
Accursed feet!
I will never have a minute of peace in this filthy life...
And to top it off,
I not even believe in the other.
I know... You're not going back to touching the ground anymore.
I'll take you home.
- Let's go!
- No... Put me down!
Run horse
Run without stopping...
What with my lady
You have to carry me.
Long live the revolution!
Well...
Everything is ready.
And I said... Madam, there is only to wait until the artist dies
And will you made the best investment of your life.
And it's true.
These are the arguments that to use this kind of people.
And it it worked.
Bought for 3,700 pounds...
- What is that?
- A sickle and a hammer.
Do you find funny?
- What's so funny?
- It's a matter of Morgan.
- Morgan... I'm sick of Morgan!
- He's sending me a message.
Why do not you write a postcard , like everyone else?
We can only do one thing...
- What?
- Leave this house!
- Why?
- Because Morgan is an immature!
The real world does not have any sense for him
You shalt thou change them to my house.
Your mother will not like it, but explain it best...
What we're getting married soon and that this is an emergency.
What do you think?
Charles...
Dear, I'm not sure yet.
Of me?
Or our wedding?
The two things...
- Not so easy with Morgan...
- Is there something easy with Morgan?
I know that idiot awakens in you a kind of protective instinct.
But in a marriage, the role of the child occupy the children,
Not one of the spouses.
I also scares me a little of the children...
Because with Morgan feared your children were like him.
But you're no longer with him.
Is not it true?
Poor Morgan !
- Has begun to go to a psychiatrist...
- I'm happy for him.
But I can not help feeling, somehow responsible...
Stop worrying about it.
Trust me... You do not have guilty of anything.
Oh, Charles...
With you I feel so sure.
Where it is?
I'm up.
Not up here.
I know where it is!
Here!
Listen, Morgan!
I will not call the police.
We're just going to ignore you, as if they were here.
As if you did not exist...
Neither you had never existed!
Now
Leonie and we go to his room...
We will close the door... And we'll get into bed!
Leave us alone!
Pathetic turned out, yes... But I love
I'm a superior form of life
I move Me!
I like flowers...
Children... animals...
Even  I help the poor police to cross the street.
What more do you want?
Here we are again.
Back to your old house...
When things go wrong.
Yes, go... Look out the window.
Do you see something new, Morgan?
Nothing!
- I like trains, Mom.
- Yes of course.
Also your father liked.
He worked as a donkey from 15 years
Until he got to be a machinist.
Russian locomotives carry a red star in front, right, Mom?
You have denied the working class...
Your own class, Morgan.
That's harsh words.
We gave you an education and teach you venerate
Lenin...
Marx... Harry Pollitt.
At 16 you were all a promise...
And so smart! In meetings
Party colleagues told me:
"Your son is a true intellectual, Mrs. Delt".
"So far the bourgeois had a monopoly on intelligence,"
But educated and intelligent men like Morgan make possible"
"That the working class ends ruling in this country."
Yes...
And look at you now.
I do not think you are capable of govern you or yourself, Morgan.
- Still great things in me, Mom.
- What is inside your head
Is a mystery to me.
Come on, you have the bed prepared. Lay down.
You're so funny as well, in pajamas.
... Come to bed.
- Hey, before you were clean, Morgan.
- I'm not so dirty, Mom.
I'll wash this right now.
Well? Are you comfortable in your room forever?
The truth is yes.
You're still very young.
In addition, Leonie can change your mind.
I'm on it, Mom.
Well... Good night, my dear.
- Good night, Mom.
- Have sweet dreams.
Sure yes.
- Do you love me?
- If!
- That's okay!
- And you? Still I hope do I have?
Where are you?
Charles has had a detail that to celebrate the wedding in style.
- Chest: eighty one...
- Finally we can invite
People as God intended.
Not like your previous marriage.
Like this?
No.
What Morgan has finally taken?
Long ago I do not see it.
Come on...
This is no longer a good place for you
I'll find you a new home.
All these sizes low and that kind of cuts
Fashion remind me times of the Great War.
A dreadful fashion, by the way!
Oh, no!
- That crackpot has done that?
- Of course... Who else?
If you are in this house
I think will be best to call the police.
No, Mom, stay here.
I'll find...
Do not sit here!
Morgan, come out!
- Leonie...
- Where is Napier?
Do you think find here
Leonie's bedroom, right?
Right here it is where you find it... thought
I know that does not sound very decent... but things are as they are.
- We made a mistake letting loose.
- Wait there, Morgan. I'm coming
You are absolutely right.
- Do you call the police or shall I?
- Mom, please... Let me.
I suppose you know that you can lock him in contempt
-... To the court ruling.
- Yes Yes. Now go, Mom.
- Crazy Old!
- How you...?
It has escaped me.
I did not mean it.
- I'll call your father.
- Oh, Mom, no...
Then you apáñatelas by yourself!
You have to go.
Step cold sleeping in the car.
And fear, too.
I need music, electric light...
Women!
Young Women!
When they come for me, may be confused
And take her to you thinking that is not human.
You're not well.
Do not you realize?
I'm perfectly.
My heart beats, my bowels are functioning normally...
're So funny, Morgan...
I'm not going back with you but...
I have very fond of you.
Thank you for your "honey".
I wish you could understand.
- I want to Charles.
- Why?
I want a normal life, like was mine before I met you.
I see... But why?
Because that's how I am.
I'm so...
I can feel the gaze rapacious your mother
Spying on us through the eye of that lock.
Because you do nothing, I to call the police right now!
Mrs. Henderson... Are you a grotesque bourgeois prejudiced.
The police will not serve anything.
Accept Me as I am.
No false gratitude or compassion.
O
I will make you fly through the air.
Under conditions where is he is capable of anything.
Please Morgan.
Come on... Come on...
Tic, tac, cuidadito mom...
You're sitting on a time bomb
Yes, I am Mrs. Henderson.
Tell my husband get on the phone.
Hello? With whom I speak?
Tell him to put now!
What do you mean by that is met?
All you have to do is tell
What.?
I do not care who is the Prime Minister
! Do go get it!
Miss Cartwright...
Thanks to God who has you put...
This is very important.
Tell me the favor of Mr.
Henderson when we got to...
He has flown!
My gorilla!
Leonie! Leonie!
- Where you are?
- Mom... What happened?
- Are you okay?
- Do you think I am?
My gorilla!
He has set fire to the house!
Save my gorilla!
And he tried to kill me!
- What is this?
- Is your gorilla.
Well... I'll shoot!
- I'll throw right now!
- Somebody save my gorilla!
Morgan Delt,
I will do everything in my power
To get you locked up!
Who the hell is my wife?
And is fuming!
Stop!
Follow him, quick!
Stop! Get back here!
Stop! High!
Hit me...
- Hello, Wally.
- Morgan... What are you doing here?
- Come on, Wally.
- See you later...
- I want to make him wait.
- Come on, you have to go back.
Zest.
That you would be a kidnapping, you know?
We'd get in trouble.
Yes, of course. I know.
- But it is illegal.
- Yes, of course... Do you mind?
- No. What about you?
- No.
I am willing to do, the end of the day your wife...
That's what the law does not take into account
Morgan... The human element
Your father and I took some strokes, in the old days.
Nothing important... And it was for political reasons.
To explain crime must address the human element, he said.
And I knew what he said.
Although I think your wife not like it.
I was born in a wrong kind, believe me.
If I had paired with a female chimpanzee
-... None of this would have happened.
- You can swear.
No...
Come on. I'm with you, Morgan.
When passing through the street,
They all turn to look.
No wench like her, Ni never ever be...
Are you comfortable there?
No.
I always love you...
She always want me...
We are five years for this...
It recognizes that this time I have tried. Do not you think?
No... I see.
I will always be yours.
She will always be mine.
And even if it is far away, I know she will wait me.
I'm going to sleep for a while.
When I remember, I begin to mourn
I will always be yours,
She will always be mine.
Top lovebirds... have arrived.
Here we are.
Go out and look at this.
- Where are we?
- In Paradise. Did not it say?
Like this?
Because this is where we live!
- It is high time to rest.
- Wait s end this, Wally.
Tomorrow is another day.
- What are we going to do now?
- We will live here, I told you.
- This is not a good hiding.
- We'll see.
Yes, we'll see if ended up in jail.
- Wally?
- What?
I do not want to be here.
Give him a chance.
Do not make pricked my conscience...
At the end conseguiréis
I finish a headache.
I go to sleep.
Goodnight.
The first thing is to try.
Right! Do what you want!
We'll be here a few weeks!
Try  we are closer.
This time you'll end up in jail
's In your hand help it.
Not a chance.
You will not let me locked, right?
I have no choice. Only when you enclose
I can marry Charles.
Suddenly, I have fear.
There is only one thing in this world better than my fantasies...
And you.
In addition to the incidents described,
Your Honor, Mrs. Delt added:
"On 13 April this
Morgan Delt came to my house and insisted that should accompany it."
Noting a strange and aggressive tone in their attitude
I agreed not to provoke a backlash
"On several occasions I tried go home. But he stopped me."
"My ex-husband has a friend named Wally Carver professional wrestling known as The Gorilla
"That man led us to
Wales, where we camped for two days."
"During that time, my ex-husband prevented me from telephoning my parents or anyone who had able to help me."
"He made it clear he did not recognize the court ruling divorce
"And was determined to make me stay with him."
"I was a little scared and very uncomfortable in that place, so I tried to convince Wally to warn my parents."
Thank you, Mr. Fredericks.
Does the defendant mean something?
Do you have something to say?
I do not recognize this court.
That's irrelevant.
And then there is the added difficulty have ignored an earlier judgment.
Therefore sentenced him to enter prison
- The official present?
- Honor...
Hey you... Come on.
Come on. Are you kidding.
Okay.
Remind me in when we get back to London.
- Leonie...
- Harry...
See.
Jimmy, I'm glad to see you.
What, dear?
- And then the guy goes and...
- Let me give you my congratulations, sir
- May you be very happy.
- Thank you, Geoffrey.
I'm so glad to see you...
Attention, gentlemen, please... Just a moment...
It is a minute...
I think it is time to lift the bow swords for the couple.
Just have to go under, say a few words and cut the cake.
Prepare yourselves, gentlemen.
I will convince Mr. Henderson to speak.
I am very happy that Charles is the guiding hand of Leonie
To cut this cake.
Ladies and gentlemen: all my friends know I'm a shy guy.
In fact, I really struggled
Leonie ask her to marry me.
I think it was she who did everything
So, before cutting the cake
I express my hope, that this is the first and last time.
See a knife hands of my wife.
- Do something!
- Do not let you get closer!
No! Can not be!
- Damn crazy!
- Hit it hard!
Get him out of here!
It's there!
It's there!
It's burning!
Do not take it personally...
- But I have come to wear it.
- Sure... I understand.
- Well, here it is.
- I had not noticed.
First, that arm, sir...
That's perfect.
I feel fine. Very good.
Please, sir...
So, that is.
That's it, Charlie!
You can take it!
Let's do it!
Hurry up, Mr. Delt.
Come on, hurry.
Perfect.
When everyone comes you can not speak, so
If you have something to say is better than tell you now.
- Do you have anything to say?
- Yes
Or I have become deaf suddenly, or you have not said anything.
I do not remember what I was going to say.
A continuous revolution in the means of production.
Uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions
Old certainties and traditions disappear.
And new become old before their time.
All the old conventions and estates dissolve.
Everything was sacred is profaned
.
Everything was sacred is profaned
The men at last are forced to consider their living conditions
And their relationships with their peers.
Amen.
Is everything to your liking, sir Delt?
- Could you give me a ride, agent?
- Of course.
We still have some time. Hold on, sir.
Well, here they are. I'm leaving.
I have to be on time for dinner, sir.
Sure.
Prepare... Weapons!
Aim!
Fire!
I have dreamed he was dead.
- Really?
- Yes
I have become hairy.
- What beautiful flowers.
- Yes, I like flowers.
The child is mine?
Come on now, out of the way!
Michelangelo! Good dog!
Welcome back, my lord
What are you trying to tell me?
Antonio, what is this on Michelangelo's head?
Just a scratch, my lord. I put some ointment on it
Poor Michelangelo! We'll take a look at it later. Get up now, let me pass
- Antonio...
- Yes, my lord?
- Has the lawyer gone?
- No, sir, he's still waiting
What a bore!
Look at all these telegrams!
Will you be needing me again, my lord?
No, you can go
This must stop, they've gone too far
When the press take this kind of attitude
We can't go on ignoring
Ottavio! At last! Welcome back. How are you?
I thought it was advisable to consult a few colleagues
Professor Verardelli...
Mr. Simone... and my most valuable assistant the shrewd, perceptive, indispensable Mr. Alcamo
Pleased to meet you
The situation is so serious, I felt their opinion would
Who is that?
Why, he's one of the top lawyers in Milan!
Here are today's papers, sorted according to political stripe
- You saw them, I hope?
- Yes, on the plane
Here are the French ones. All tripe!
Hardly, if I felt it necessary
Turn the lights on in the library, please
Where were you? I tried to reach you in London,
Paris...
Where on earth have you been?
I'll tell you later
Professor, would you step into the library, please?
You too, Mr. Simone. And you, Mr. Alcamo, come along
We haven't decided on a line of action yet but we were thinking about...
Mr. Alcamo! We're in the library
As I was saying, this is no easy case
It's lucky you called in the end, or what could we do?
Did you call because you heard I was looking for you?
No, because I needed money. Would you please instruct the
- I'll tell you later
- Whenever you like
"We're just good friends" says Count Lech
This rag here... The pigs!
You've only seen yesterday's papers. I thought as much!
If you'd bothered to glance at this morning's you'd have seen they carry the story on the front page
See for yourself, Professor. We're the news of the day
I filed a libel suit at once, of course after consulting with Professor Verardelli and Mr. Alcamo but, in the circumstances, with no power to bring evidence
That was the worst thing you could have done
If there was ever a time to buy the press off, that was now
What a thing to say!
We were negotiating, but after the police raid the press got hold of the story and things came to a head
And of course the price went sky-high
Could I be responsible for negotiating a sum like that?
- Do you want to know how much?
- I don't want to know anything!
You could have asked my wife for the money!
Talk sense! Your wife?!
Sure, why not?
Oh yes, just like that. Where is your wife anyway?
How should I know? Where is my wife?
That's what I'd like to know. Your wife's vanished
Vanished?
- There, see
- See what?
You don't realize how serious the situation is
Wait a minute... Your wife went out yesterday afternoon to go to the hairdresser's. She never came back
Her father has called four times to ask her to join him in Burgenstock at once
But she hasn't arrived in Switzerland yet
In fact, I can assure you beyond a shadow of doubt that your wife hasn't crossed the border by car, by rail or by air
Understandably, in view of my concern on the advice of the Professor and Mr. Alcamo
I thought it best to call the police
As a matter of fact, we actually went to Police Headquarters ourselves where the inspector, a real gentleman, wasn't he?
He was very kind and...
Speaking of which, we were supposed to call him
Why do you have to ask him where my wife is?
Ask Antonio, ask Franz!
Antonio and Franz! Whatever next!
You don't realize how serious the situation is
I do realize! And I thought you were a genius, whereas...
Hello, Police Headquarters? This is Mr. Zacchi
Put me on to Chief Inspector Pizzi, please
He's out? But we had an appointment!
Tell him I'll call again
"The flames of young Count Lech"
Ottavio, calm down. Don't be so childish
Leave the domestics out of it
We have to stop the scandal, not spread it around
I'll ask Antonio to bring us a drink then
But if you had worried less about my wife and more about keeping the press quiet...
I worried about your wife for reasons you should understand
Out of humanity, for one thing
- You called, sir?
- I've been calling for an hour!
Go and ask the gentlemen if they would like a drink your wife is young and foreign
She may be distraught by the scandal...
My lord? Right away, my lord
Move!
Because let's face it, it is a scandal
- You should have prevented it
- How?
I'll try to save you from the consequences on all sides
- Including the tax man
- The tax man my hat!
You're not being sensible!
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you
I'll have some coffee
Franz, coffee! And a Martini for me
Cocktails, huh?
I'll have plain water with lots of ice
We need that here... ice
Listen, if we thought it was essential
Don't raise your voice, please
Let's have no arguments, no digressions
If we thought it was essential for your wife to be here it was for a good reason, as the professor will agree
Oh, I quite agree, Mr. Zacchi
Mr. Alcamo and Mr. Simone? We all agree
A gesture by your wife would have made an impression
Her sympathy, her support, her...
But what do we have? Nothing!
You know your father-in-law has frozen all your bank accounts?
Yessir, yesterday morning. It's within his power due to that unfortunate minor detail whereby the property is all in your wife's name in Switzerland.
- We did it for tax purposes. So?
So we're in your father-in-law's hands
That's fine provided we all get on well together
But if there's talk of a divorce, it's a...
It's a disaster
Not that you can really blame your father-in-law
If you will get mixed up with expensive call-girls it's the least you can expect
But apart from the money, I can shrug at his moral concern
What worries me is your wife's attitude
She probably doesn't want to help you if she's gone
What is it?
Her ladyship is in her room
In her room? Since when?
She came back just after his lordship. When she heard the gentlemen were here, she didn't want to disturb you
- Go on, Zacchi, call the police
- You can laugh!
Ask them for information
Now where are you going?
To see my wife
You want me to talk to her, don't you?
Yes, that's right
You know what to say
Expect her to be hurt and miserable, but you work on her
We need a statement for the press
Money, if we have to move in the jungle!
She must make a supportive statement
Gentlemen, I'll do my best
Ottavio, there's one more thing...
Every one of those girls named you to the police
Are you sure?
Well, it's not surprising. My advice is, deny everything
Or admit the absolute minimum if there's no alternative
But be careful, a wife is always... you know what I mean
We'll wait in the library and hope for the best
- Ottavio! Easy now...
- Go away!
Just a minute, dear
Where have you been?
I was getting worried
Answer me
You've seen the papers, huh?
What?
More lies than anything, you know
I'm sorry for your father, he takes everything seriously
Yes, he does... He really does
What really gets me is the tone of these articles
They sound like something out of "The Merry
Widow". Filth!
Well, Pupe?
What's the matter with you?
Nothing. I want you to listen to something, then we'll talk
I'm too tense to listen to music right now
It's not music. Wait a minute...
You still haven't told me where you've been
They looked for you everywhere, even the police
I went around... I saw a lot of things...
I thought... I made some important decisions...
I stood and gazed at a wall for a long time
A big white wall... all white...
It was there that...
Listen...
"I love you, oh cypress tree"
"for your melancholy is like me"
- What's that?
- A poem, stupid
I wrote it. Do you like it?
Say you like it... I love it
Maybe I didn't hear it right
"I love you, oh cypress tree, for your melacholy is like me"
The idea is good but it sounds wrong somehow
You don't know Italian well enough to write poetry
I don't think you can say "your melancholy is like me"
Why not? It's a poem
So what? Grammar has rules
- What is the rule then?
- I don't know
I can't remember, but it's wrong!
What a time to pick anyway!
Write it in German, it'll turn out better
It won't. German is my language but I never studied it
I went to school in France and England
Write in French or English then
But my Italian's much better. Anyway, it came to me like that
Poetry has to do with inspiration
- That poem sounds wrong
- You mean it's ugly?
I have no talent? I'd better stop? I'll stop then
I'm very sorry because it's so important for me, for you...
It sounds wrong to me, but I'm no expert
I know. You're only an expert in... call-girls
Come on, I told you there's no truth in what the papers say
Almost no truth
My lawyers will deny everything
What little truth there is unimportant
You're too smart not to know how to rate these things
The rate is exactly what I didn't know until today
The money, you mean? Surely you don't think
I don't think, I know. The girls told me
What?
I was with them all afternoon yesterday
First Mirella, then Lilli...
They're all out on bail
I made the most of it. I wanted to get the picture
I spoke to the organizer too... Imola
That's her name, isn't it?
- How could you?
- What's so strange?
The phone... go on!
- What?
- It's your father
Tell him I'll be right there
Antonio, ask my father-in-law to wait a second
Yes, put him on... Oh, Antonio, I'm a bit hungry
Yes, of course, for his lordship too
Tell him it's all a political ploy
I can't hear!
Why have the accounts been frozen?
You wanted to speak to him? I'm sorry.
I wanted to know why he instructed...
Daddy sends his love
It's Antonio. Your visitors are waiting, what should they do?
They're to wait. Thank you, Antonio
They're my lawyers. Your father has to know there's a lot of trouble here!
Don't ask Daddy for money. He's furious with you
You have a good time at my expense
Who's having a good time?
And when have we ever quibbled about what's yours and mine?
Have I ever said this house is mine? The estate is mine?
No, since they don't yield a cent
Let's sell them then! You want the house and the estate
Isn't that why we got married?
But there's no point in talking about it
I wouldn't give a dime for this stuff now
I told you, I made some very important decisions
Either we separate, which is what Daddy would like...
Oh, so that's what your darling daddy wants?
Well, you know...
Daddy was happy we got married because of the prestige but he never liked you much
He doesn't believe you're tormented
He thinks you're just stupid and crude
Does he now? That's nice to know
Would you like to hear what I think of him?
- Don't bother, I know
- That's good
There's no help for it. Daddy's a blunt, simple man
You can't blame him for that
To him, anyone who spends 700 dollars to sleep with a girl does it to have a good time, not because he's bored
You should know me better than to think that
Listen, I'll tell you how it all started
It was all for old Imola's sake
She was about 30 when I was a kid
You could say we all started out there
Alberico... Giorgio... me...
Then the years went by and Imola vanished
One day we heard she was back in business again and we felt the urge to look her up
Like, you know, going into the loft to look at the toys you played with as a kid
And the girls? How do they come into it?
I told you, we wanted to give old Imola a gift
Big deal! You gave her 700 dollars and she gave 400 to the girls
You could have given Imola 300 dollars and saved the other 400, since the girls meant nothing to you
I doubt that though, seeing as you benefited them eleven times
Still, they're pretty girls. Especially... Lilli
You admit it then? You liked her?
What is this, Pupe? Don't say you're jealous?
Are you crazy? We're both free to go with whoever we want
That was what we agreed
The marriage is between you and Daddy
He's the one who's angry
- Yes, what is it?
- Your dinner, ma'am
Come in, Antonio!
Put everything on there
Franz, the champagne
You didn't say what you wanted, ma'am, so I...
- That's fine, Antonio
- Thank you, ma'am
- Mr. Zacchi is...
- Okay, okay, I know
Bear with me, honey...
Zacchi's still waiting
The lawyers feel that if you make a statement to the press
The lawyers, you say?
Let them state what they like, I'm not interested
Isn't that what we pay them for?
Antonio, Franz, please take the cats downstairs feed them and get their baskets ready
I may leave tonight, so I'll take them with me
- You're hungry?
- No!
- Franz, the cats
- Yes, the cats!
Must you get the cats right now?
Of course. It won't take a minute
The lawyers are still waiting. What are you going to do?
You're talking about leaving... a separation...
The lawyers want a statement of moral and tangible support
I mentioned a separation because you may not appreciate my plans for the future
Your call-girls forced me to think things over
Think what over, Pupe?
I want to get a job
The phone! Hurry, darling
My hands are full, I can't get it
Hello? Yes... For you, my lord... Mr. Zacchi!
Sorry, Zacchi. Yes, I'll be right with you
My wife? You've no idea how understanding she's been
Yes, yes... She has agreed... in principle to issuing a statement
Yes, she's been wonderful! Yes, of course...
Hello... hello?
Excuse me, Zacchi, there's a long-distance call
Your father again, from Burgenstock!
Put him on
Now what does he want?
We made a bet. 100,000 dollars!
Daddy thinks I'm not capable of earning a living
Oh no, he wet me!
Franz, take the cat... and see to the others too
Yes, I'll have to start from scratch as if I owned nothing but this dress
Well, a clean one maybe.
How about you?
Don't you think it would be fun to start working?
What fun is there in that?
The notion that work isn't boring went out with the ark
Ask Antonio...
Yes, sir?
You're bored, aren't you?
But surely you're not terribly bored?
I mean, you're not bored to distraction?
You have some little worries, like, say...
Oh yes, our pay! You promised me...
All in good time! You may go, Antonio
Did you have to ask him? I can judge for myself!
Sure, since when?
And even if Antonio is bored he won't end up in the gossip columns like you!
What nonsense!
If Antonio has it off with a woman in the park and then gives her two dollars, nobody cares
They certainly don't turn it into headline news on the front page! Whereas the very same thing...
It's not the same, dear
The difference is if Antonio, after a day's work, goes and...
Oh, you don't understand. And don't think you can put me off
I'll start working, that's definite
I'd like to write, but at some future time
There are so many other jobs that have more to offer
Not the phone again!
Yes, what is it?
Oh, it's you, Mr. Zacchi! Where are you calling from?
You're still waiting, poor man?
Professor who? How kind of him!
He must be starving!
Yes, of course, I already told Ottavio
Do as you think best about those statements
Call my maid, please
No, not a denial, we'd look ridiculous. It's all true!
I'm surprised at you
Your lawyers say the papers printed lies
They want you to believe that because they think you're upset
Mr. Zacchi, do you really think
I have a middle-class outlook?
Even middle-class women are more open-minded these days
Yes, they are. People read, they go to the movies
Everybody does exactly the same things
Aristocrats, intellectuals, teen-agers...
I agree with Ottavio there
This is no scandal, this is just a banal little thing
I told my father that too
What did you say?
Yes, don't worry, the accounts have been unfrozen
Daddy knows quite well this is one time Ottavio won't do anything rash
Pay what has to be paid, and that's that
Erminia, would you run my bath, please?
Hello, Mr. Zacchi? I warn you you'll have to ask Ottavio for money now
I won't withdraw another penny
I've stopped living on an income... Yes, that's right
I'm going to work
Starting tomorrow, and I'm very happy
No, don't say that. Do you ever get bored?
But... not to distraction?
There, see!
No, believe me, it's because you work
Excuse me a minute...
Erminia, take the phone, would you?
Are you still there?
I'm sorry, I have so much to do
Believe me, I gave it a lot of thought
No, don't say that, it's not a sudden decision
No, I couldn't say... We'll probably split up
I'll try to explain by telling you what I said to someone yesterday afternoon, while I was trying to work things out
Yes, a street vendor I stopped to talk to on my walk
Then you try to explain it to my husband
Where is my husband? Right here
I don't know how to make him understand these moods of mine
Right away, hold on
Zacchi asks you to go to him in the library
Yes... of course not!
Don't think that when I got married
I had any illusions of being able to communicate
I knew quite well I would be horribly lonely
I only married my husband so our property could marry
I respect money so much that I've decided to earn it!
I want to become an ordinary woman with a concrete job and a lot of real worries, like yours
Yes... a physical attraction is not enough to make a marriage
It comes... and then it goes
Goodbye, Mr. Zacchi
Take care of everything and keep me informed or I'll be completely in the dark
I won't even have the money to buy a newspaper now
It's all taken care of the family side, anyway!
Which is important, isn't it?
The family is a masterpiece of nature, as Saint lala said
- Who said?
- I'll tell you later
Would you mind signing this power of attorney?
Then as a reward I'll tell you who Saint lala was
Excellent, thank you
Thank goodness, that's settled
Are you sure the bank accounts have been unfrozen?
Mr. Alcamo! We're still here
I'm sure, Pupe told me
If you'd told me, I'd be worried. Because as a lawyer you're worth...
She said some strange things... What's this about working?
A sudden whim?
Not that I disapprove, it could make quite an impression
I'll mention it at the press conference, it'll help you
Stick close to your wife. She says it doesn't matter, but...
I think it'll help if you're seen around a lot together
Don't you agree?
Go everywhere! The opera, the theatre...
- Goodbye
- You've been invaluable
Well done, dear Ottavio
He's a good lad really, don't you think?
- Done everything?
- He just wanted a signature
I wanted to thank you. You've been very kind, as usual
Yes, I know
Just one thing...
I'm drying myself, give me a hand!
What is it?
Listen, there's just one thing I didn't like
You told Zacchi ours was a marriage of convenience but I wouldn't have married you if I hadn't liked you, not even if you'd been a
Rockefeller
That's nice to know. A Rockefeller!
Starting tomorrow I'll be a typist! No, not that
I can't type. I'd better do something else
Maybe I'll be a stewardess
Are you busy tonight?
No, not that, it's dangerous
Like to go out?
Planes crash, I'd be crazy to do that
- Let's go to the Rock
- No, I'm going out
- On your own?
- Yes
Oh, okay! May I ask where you're going?
I have to call in at La Scala
- How come?
- To see Valli
But it's nothing you'd be interested in, sweetheart
It's about my plans for a job
What has Valli got to do with your job?
He promised to introduce me to Gianni
You want to model for him? Why not start your own business?
That takes a lot of money and I have none
The belt, Erminia
Sorry then, I get the message. I'll go out on my own
I'll go to the club
Have a good time!
Brush and hat, Erminia!
My jewellery!
Stole and purse, please
Tidy up and turn the lights out, I'll be back very late
Good night, ma'am
Clear the table in my room, Antonio
Good night, dear
Franz, please ask Mario to get the car out
The Jaguar, ma'am?
No, the Fiat. I want to drive
Right away, ma'am
I thought you were going out?
No, I want to read for a while
There's no light here
- Forgotten something?
- It's all wrong
This outfit, can't you see? Just look at it!
What's wrong with it?
It's too chic for someone who's looking for a job
What would you wear?
You're going to La Scala, aren't you?
But I'm not going to see an opera!
When did you ever go just to see an opera?
Listen, Pupe... I'll give you a hand
- I don't trust you
- I have very good taste
Well? What do you think I should wear? Tell me
Go just as you are, you look wonderful
You're very pretty, honestly
That's the main essential when it comes to finding a job
There, see, you don't understand!
You judge by the same yardstick you use with
Speaking of which, I'd like to know one thing
Say when you went to see dear old Imola
I had been there with the other girls who would you have picked?
Careful... you must tell the truth
I'd have picked you
Well, well... I'm glad
Can you picture it? Me there, and you...
I'm going to die laughing!
- Are they going out or not?
- My guess is, not any more
Lay off the champagne!
Turn the lights out and close the shutters
I'll just make a call
You're always on the phone!
Hello, Gina? Can you hear me?
I can't make it
They were going out but they changed their mind
Come on, hurry it up!
Yes, I know, but I can't
Tomorrow night? Yes, okay
I'll take you to the movies
Yes, sure... All right...
What do you want?
That's not a kiss, you're cheating
You're so funny! Do you know what I was thinking?
How often have we been to bed together since we were married?
I don't know, what a question!
It's already 13 months. If we say an average of...
Hold on...
- At least 150
- 150 what?
Us two, together
At what your girls charge, you know what you owe me?
Sixty thousand dollars!
I can buy a penthouse and open a boutique
You're nuts!
You said you would have picked me
I calculated the flat rate
I mean 400 dollars, without Imola's commission
No, no, too easy
I don't want to make any mistakes
I'd better not go tonight
I don't trust Valli anyway. And you're right about
Gianni
Yes, a boutique is better
Or antiques. Everybody does it
It's easy. Or an art gallery. Yes, just the thing!
What's that? New?
Chanel... It's ever so old, I've had it a month
- Never seen it before
- You don't look at me
You may be right, but I can see you now
- No, none of that...
- I feel like it
- Just a physical urge?
- That's right
You know what then? Go to Imola's girls
That's what they're for. It's their job
- But I want you!
- Do you? Pay me then
- 400 or 700?
- 400 dollars!
Are you on? It's a fair price, isn't it?
I wouldn't think twice if I were you
You'll save the extra charge
You realize you have to earn it?
- Take Lilli now...
- Oh, I know, don't worry
Where did you learn?
That's none of your business
Come here, come here!
Tell me... please!
I got Lilli to explain it to me
What?
I'll pay you, you know
I don't trust you, dear
In advance!
Okay!
Who? My father?
Tell him I can't speak to him now because... I'm working
And please tell him
I've found a job
Yes... a job... Thank you
Pupe, may I come in?
Hey there, Turazzi.
It's me.
It's me.
- Sure, I remember. What you doing here?
- Wherever there's a fair on, I'm around.
- You'd better see to it that I pick out a winner.
- This is your lucky day, my friend.
Well, give me two then. The 90 and the 5.
Well, give me two then. The 90 and the 5.
That's 6,000.
- You raised the price too, you little chiseler!
You think you'd pay more for a laxative. And if you win it you won't have any complaints.
Alright, let's have another, the 13.
Alright, let's have another, the 13.
Er, would you maybe have a friend? Someone I can trust, you know?
- Not someone too young.
- Come here a second, I got a good thing.
Don't yell! It's the kind of thing could get us in hot water.
Don't yell! It's the kind of thing could get us in hot water.
You just hang on. I'll sell them all for you.
- Hey, boys! Listen to me!
- Oh now look, Turazzi! Please.
I will not be an ostrich, my friends!
- That's what they said on the radio.
- Well, as long as it's said on the radio...
- That's what they said on the radio.
- Well, as long as it's said on the radio...
There's a great danger of war. Why attempt to conceal it? Don't imitate the ostrich!
I declare I won't be an ostrich!
War? What war? It's you who'll talk us into a war. Ivo!
- Maybe they'll ask your permission to begin.
- This time it's a question of who gets to the
- Maybe they'll ask your permission to begin.
- This time it's a question of who gets to the button first. There's not much to be done.
- Yes, but who'll want to assume such a responsibility in the pages of history?
- You're the veterinarian. You're soft- hearted.
Don't bother with all this nonsense, I say. If you want to enjoy life, I'll show you how! Ivo!
What have you got, Turazzi?
A raffle, a lottery. Call it what you like, the drawing's tonight.
- I never yet made anything that way.
- You'd do better to look at a newspaper!
When I follow the news, things are just as bad as now. Ivo, come on!
When I follow the news, things are just as bad as now. Ivo, come on!
There's no catch here, nothing shady. It's based on the winner of the national lottery.
If the first number is 62 and you got 62 then you're the winner. It proves you're naturally lucky. Born under a lucky star. You'll weep tears of joy and a prize you'll never forget.
Lucky. Born under a lucky star. You'll weep tears of joy and a prize you'll never forget.
Please, lower your voices! Alright gentlemen, that'll be 3,000.
- Three for all of us?
- For one. It's a bargain price too, I swear it.
What do we get, a palace?
- The most precious thing in the world!
What do we get, a palace?
- The most precious thing in the world!
What's the most precious thing in the world?
- Please! You'll have me arrested...
- Are you the one who sells tickets?
- I said don't yell! I'll be there in a second.
Will you explain it? Don't bawl it out, will you!
- How many numbers in the national lottery?
- So that's why he's selling 70 tickets.
70 tickets? 70 times 3 means 210,000 lire!
- You've seen her, of course?
I have seen her. Take a chance. At six she'll be yours, or someone else's.
I have seen her. Take a chance. At six she'll be yours, or someone else's.
- Six o'clock precisely.
- You sit down in front of your television, open those ears of yours and listen. Bari, nothing.
Milan, nothing. Cagliari, nothing...
Naples? Naples, you stop there. The very first number on the wheel, that's the winner.
Naples? Naples, you stop there. The very first number on the wheel, that's the winner.
- Naples, because she's a Neapolitan.
- Who!?!
Explain to them 'under your breath. We're among gentlemen. How many?
The whole block of tickets. And if I were richer I'd buy them all!
The whole block of tickets. And if I were richer I'd buy them all!
You're right. You all come with me. We'll go look over the merchandise.
- Give me number 14.
- Which one?
Alright... Explain to these fellows that it's a delicate matter, will ya?
Alright... Explain to these fellows that it's a delicate matter, will ya?
Don't worry, I'll bring them back here. We're going off to have a look at the goods.
Those guys'll get me thrown into jail with their shouting. Number 14.
- And 13!
- It's sold already.
Bravo, bravo! All the fire-crackers. You're the sharp-shooting champion.
Bravo, bravo! All the fire-crackers. You're the sharp-shooting champion.
People of Lugo... aim at the balloons. No more of those fire-crackers.
Come on, onwards and upwards, there is more fun here and more kicks!
You're a real champion. Aim at the balloons, it's easy.
No pushing now. You know you don't like getting pushed while you shoot.
No pushing now. You know you don't like getting pushed while you shoot.
People of Lugo, be an example. Aim at the balloons now.
That's enough now, hmm? Aim at the balloons, it's easy.
...it's easy.
Come on, see if you can hit the string. Break the string that holds the bottle of the world-famous wine produced in the hills of
Frascati.
Try and break the string. People of Lugo don't push now...
Hey, you play on this side! You there.
Finished shooting? That's three loadings...
Thank you, sir
Thank you, sir
Ah, you old letchers.
Aim at the baloons, it's easy. You get one shot for 10 lire.
People of Lugo, try for the balloons, it's easy.
People of Lugo, try for the balloons, it's easy.
Do you want to reload gentlemen? Don't you want to reload?
I must have a look at this wonder.
Pistol or rifle?
- Why, she's never seen you before.
- The police must not got wind of this deal.
- He's pulling wool over your eyes. It's a trick.
- Well I swear it's alright.
I hope I drop dead right now if I told you a single lie.
I hope I drop dead right now if I told you a single lie.
Aim at the target, gentlemen.
Oh, what a target!
...Well, I'm going back for a ticket, or ten!
Alright, but why do you need this lottery? No more than 20,000 and you could have her.
You're wrong. Listen, I've tried it. Here you can only see her head.
Come on, we can do better than that.
- Papa, take a look at the new target!
- And what do you think you're doing here?
Supposing when you win she says: 'Sorry, you're not my type, sir'. Supposing she says:
'You're too darn small'.
- And you're too darn stupid.
'You're too darn small'.
- And you're too darn stupid.
Come on, can anybody break the string?
Just break the string for one bottle of fine Albano wine from Frascati.
Step right up, people of Lugo. One bulls-eye wins the wine...
Step right up, people of Lugo. One bulls-eye wins the wine...
Break the string, break the string. Folks, it's easy!
Just break the string...
Let's have a big hand for the champ now, people of
Lugo.
Let's have a big hand for the champ now, people of
Lugo.
The prize is one bottle of Albano wine from
Frascati...
Don't you tempt me, you pig!
Zoe!
- You can try those tricks on your sister.
- I haven't got one!
- You can try those tricks on your sister.
- I haven't got one!
All the better for her. Stay away until you learn some manners. That's 5,000.
- Are you crazy?
- Can't you count, you cheapskate?
Shut up and pay the lady...
Aim at the balloons, it's easy, onwards and upwards, people of Lugo...
Aim at the balloons, it's easy, onwards and upwards, people of Lugo...
Mamma mia, a bull!
Mamma mia!
- He's looking straight at me!
- It's you red blouse! Take it off quick!
- He's looking straight at me!
- It's you red blouse! Take it off quick!
Go on, get him!
Bravo! You're a hero!
- Don't put it on again!
- Yeah, don't put it on again!
- If you're shooting stay, if not you can go.
- Hey, I've got the 13, the 5 and the 90.
- If you're shooting stay, if not you can go.
- Hey, I've got the 13, the 5 and the 90.
So long.
If I could just pay just a little a time, you'll see, then
I'd buy 20 of them.
Can't do that, 'cause we're always on the move.
Today we're here, tomorrow there.
Well, that's a pretty high price. That's two days' work...
Well, that's a pretty high price. That's two days' work...
Oh please, let me win! If I will, I'll walk without shoes until the sanctuary of Saint Luca!
Oh please, let me win! If I will, I'll walk without shoes until the sanctuary of Saint Luca!
- Well, when do we get the results?
- When the stands close up for the night.
What's you opinion?
- Let's form a corporation! I got 1,500 lire.
- No, no.
- What's your objection?
...I'm absolutely sure of winning.
- I'll be around later.
- So long... How can you make a company
- I'll be around later.
- So long... How can you make a company where profits can't be shared?
- What about playing 'odds and evens'?
Alright, Saverio, you sing sweet music. From here on we're partners in lust...
What do you want?
Please, could I join you? I'd like to.
- Ah, go ring your bells, little man.
- This isn't for you, sacristy.
I dreamt of her the whole night through. She was going to bed
I dreamt of her the whole night through. She was going to bed and she was taking off her petticoat. But after that there was another, and I kept saying:
'Hurry, take it all off, would you? Take it off now! '. But she kept stripping off things.
Always more petticoats! Well she must've had on
Princess Teodoli has left on her yacht for the
Balearic Islands, accompanied by Hyacinth of Belmonte, Dame Maria
Gonzales, the Marquis of Valfaruta, the Commissioner of
Labour Orlandini,
Duke and Duchess of Pontesemolo, Mina and Totó di Regalis, Giotto and Consuela
Barotti, Cris and Giulio di Mont-sant, the Count of
Caprari, and Hh... this is full of aitches. See if you can pronounce it. I can't.
- Seems like a 'b'.
- No, that's an aitch.
- So then he's a Turk.
Nadine di Orsandor, Pupe Crionovesti, Gigi de Príía,
Toni Morgandis, the Countess of Solmi. They'll finish their cruise next month, stopping at Palermo.
...the poorer is a duke.
Ah, what a fool I was not to learn how to read! If I'd just finished first grade even!
- If you spend one day at it, you can write.
- So what!
Now I've got to worry about making a living. If I could only save up 6 million lire. Seven.
Better make it eight, and then I'll be independent.
I'll marry whoever I please, just like Countess Solmi and the rest.
Money, money, money makes men bolder.
Especially if you're older.
- Zoe!
- What do you want?
- I want a look! Then I'll buy a ticket.
Morons! What a pair of fat-heads! I'd like to slap their faces.
- Zoe, let's have a little look at your legs.
- How I'd like to beat some manners into you!
- Don't get all hot and bothered little girl.
- Be polite, you two ignorant peasants!
- Listen to her, will you?
- I want to see Naples before I die!
Take off your hat, boy, when you mention Naples.
Before I'd go with those two, I'd take charity. They make you want to forget all these lotteries. Vilma, this is the last one.
Money's the root of all evil...
I want to get a carriage for the baby, lined with pink silk.
Let's pay our taxes. How'd they locate us? We never leave any address around.
- Ten years taxes, they want it all...
- Now, don't get upset, it's bad for you.
We'll give it all back to you, If you're not sure of us we'll sign over the caravan, the shooting gallery, all we've got.
- Hah! Take it, spill and spend it...
Ah, that's better, they took the hint.
You can't even put on a red blouse. There was a bull who didn't like the color?
If you die, we'll be ruined.
Cicci...
Must've come into the world with a craving for grapes!
I've just sold the last raffle tickets.
- Who to?
- Two fellas.
- The two out there?
- Yeah.
But you can't just sell tickets, you have to look at the faces!
- A bit of good taste is needed in business.
- I got lots of taste, but I'm no woman.
You'd deal in white slavery if it paid you!
- Should I ask for a certificate of morals?
You'd sell me to that French Marquis! What's his name, Vilma?
I think his name begins with an 'S'.
- If one of those two wins, what do you plan to do, huh? You sleep with them.
I'll slip out on the first train, my boy.
- We always behaved in the right way
A fine lot of sentiments, on my skin I'll just say 'so long',
I got an other offer to manage 3 stands. I'll say so long!
- You should show a little of gratitude...
...for your percentage on every sale?
You think it's easy peddling chances on a raffle?
Those prices are high.
They gave more than a million in Rome. It was in the news.
- But that's the capital. It's a very chic crowd.
- Maybe you think I'm not chic enough!
- Well then, so long! Ciao, ciao!
- You're crazy! I'll have to refund the tickets.
So return the tickets! Enough, enough!
- Zoe, stay here! Don't abandon us.
- And talk to him! I'm not his slave-girl!
I won't end up like my mother. That's all, ciao!
- I feel terrible, I feel awful.
- Wait. Wait a second. Vilma.
Vilma I was kidding, I'll stay, I won't leave you. Get some water right away. Vilma,
Vilma open your eyes, say something. I'll buy you a television set, anything you want.
They'll take away all we've got, all. They'll confiscate our little caravan.
- Calm down now. Take it easy.
- They've increased the booth area rates.
- What are booth area rates?
- A tax for your standing area.
- 16,000 per square yard.
- Never mind, Vilma, I'll fix it for you.
I swear. But you can't get upset like this. This little creature will be terrified.
...Listen, it's already moving.
...it's really moving...
- You still got some tickets?
- Sorry, sold out.
That will be 4,000 lire.
How is the bull doing?
Good evening. Come for a ride.
Sorry, I'm on duty.
- Well tonight, when you're through work.
- I would like to.
- Fine! It's a date.
- No, not tonight.
- Oh, why not?
- Because I got... well, I'm busy.
- Doing what?
- Why should I tell you?
- Oh, come on! Tell me.
- Will you load this pistol I payed or not?
Hey, hey! If you're in such a hurry, go!
- I paid! I couldn't care less!
- He's right, he paid.
- What business are you in, anyway?
- What about the customers rights?
- This won't end here...
Want to shoot this? So practice.
- Hey, have you got a boyfriend?
- Me?
Well then?
Caspar, where have you been?
What on earth are you doing there? Get on!
Don't you know someone has to ring the bells for the procession?
We've got a block of 50 raffle tickets out of 70. The stud's got to be out of this stable.
Hey, listen. The winner's got to come across with the story, all the details, the whole truth!
- The whole truth, and nothing but the truth!
- Watch the screen.
They take so long!
38? I got 38! Hey I got it!
Let's have that door shut...
- Tell the bishop to make less of a racket!
- You'll never come to any good.
The second number is 22.
- Have you read the declaration of Kruschev?
- Oh, stop bothering us!
We repeat the results of the drawing at Rome: 38,
- Well boys, what's new?
- We're waiting for the drawing.
Don't forget works of charity.
- Sorry, I have to go.
- Come on, you can stay a little while longer.
- Hey!
- Where did they hit you? Here?
- Yes.
- I'm going to choke them...
Are you crazy? Where are you aiming?
- Aim at the target, cross-eyes!
- I won't play, then.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Time for Naples.
"THE DRAWING FROM NAPLES"
Eighty-nine!
Our first draw is number 68.
Who's got 68? 30,000 cash for the 68!
Wait a minute... Wait.
Who is the winner?
A nice guy, the 68.
- Who is he? What's he like?
- His real name's Formini, Caspar.
He's a decent sort of fella. He goes to church
- Amen!
- Who's got the 68?
- The 68? How should I know?
- Well, where's Ivo, and where's Zoe?
- Are you here for the taxes?
Now what do you think of this? They say I look like my mother.
- Yes, look at the mouth, the forehead.
- Oh, I've got a lot of others too.
Just a second.
It's all under control, gentlemen, and the winner's already known in the person of
Signor Formini, called Caspar!
- Caspar?
- The sacristan?
- The sacristan?
- Here.
- See the nose? Yours is even finer.
But look here. You see this? He's much handsomer, don't you think?
- Do you have the 68?
- Yes. That's how old my mamma is.
- I'll buy it off of you for 35,000.
- 48 cash! You won, Caspar!
What's wrong, Caspar? Just a second, look out now!
I'm going to let go, help me!
42,000 for it, Caspar! Come on, Caspar!
- Good night.
- Good night, Irina
- We're through, come on we'll go dance.
- Oh, it's impossible. I've got a headache.
...she's got a headache. Good night, Geno. See you tomorrow.
- Lovely tune, eh?
- Yes, but I happen to have a headache.
- Oh. Don't worry, it'll go away.
- Cha-cha-cha.
- We'll really have fun.
- Ciao, Geno. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Oh, come on! Just one dance.
- She can't, she's got a headache!!
- Lets do a cha-cha-cha.
- Zoe!
- What do you want me to do?
- It'll make your pains disappear. Just watch.
Zoe, come back! Come on Zoe, it's time!
- I told you to let go of him!
- It's not my fault! He won't let go!
- What do you want from me?
- Just one dance and we'll all go to bed.
- Zoe!
- I've got to go, ciao, ciao!
Ciao.
Bet he doesn't have the nerve. It's one o'clock.
It's 12 minutes to.
That's 40,000 lire, what more do you want? I was the first one to give you the news.
Hurry, my son. It's already 10 minutes to one.
45! With that kind of money you can go to Bologna and marry a countess.
Word of honor, you'll marry a countess!
50,000 lire!
Came on!
Don't let yourself be bullied, Caspar.
Enjoy yourself! Enjoy yourself!
Bad thing!
Good bye now, Zoe. We'll be coming back after...
You see that girl just isn't your type and never will be.
- And besides, hard cash is hard cash!
- No, no. It's no use.
This guys crazy! He's refused 60,000.
- I'll make it 80,000!
- Caspar, you've never seen such wealth!
Listen to a friend.
- Think of your mother.
- Yeah, think of your mother!
- It's all over tomorrow morning!
- Life is long, Caspar.
- You've got the future to think about.
Caspar, you ate cabbage an hour ago. It's difficult to digest, you might faint in there!
And besides, you get emotional, Caspar. Chances are you can't take the strain!
- Look at that imbecile!
- He's gone crazy.
- What's he think he's going to accomplish?
- Nothing!
- 80,000! In 3 months.
Ah, go to the devil, then!
- What's he think he's going to do!
- Imbecile!
Come right in.
Good evening.
The door, please...
If you want to sit down.
Er, 68.
- It's not fake, is it?
- No.
I've such a bad headache.
Oh, I'm sorry about that...
Stop it!
Stop it, will you please?
What's the matter with you?
They were headed toward Vigna Cavallo...
- Have you seen a caravan?
- Just follow along this way.
- Oh, yes papa.
- Hey, what are you doing up at this hour?
Watch out!
Water melon!
Geno! Hey! What's the big idea? Hey! For God's sake...
Where are you going? Come here...
What do you use for a brain?
Are you finished so soon? Did you get tired?
Did you hurt those big hands of yours? Big and dirty, they smell like a stable.
What do you take me for? I'm a respectable girl, don't you forget it!
And for your information my father was respectable too.
And I'm free to go where I please, and when I have a debt, I pay it.
Understand that, you fat-head.
You are a fat-head.
What do you think I am? And who do you think you are?
I'll bet you never toured Italy! Ignorant lout!
You'll always be an ignorant lout! I'll fix you.
And you? Do something! What sort of a man are you?
Come on, let's see...
We'll show him a thing or two! I'll even take off my shoes!
Do something!
Sit down here...
- Why are you called Caspar?
- So was my grandfather.
Here. Here's the money...
Just take it all, and we'll forget about it.
- But, why?
- Can't you count?
You've never seen so much fortune.
- But, actually I have the right to... what I mean is... the law says...
Look now, Caspar. Think how much you'll buy with it. Let's have a smile.
Smile!
You can have your tooth replaced or go out to one of those big good dinners.
With coffee and ice cream, once a week for a whole year.
And afterwards you can give a present to your wife, to your children.
- I haven't got a wife.
- And is that my fault?
Come on, don't be so difficult. Good bye now,
Caspar. Ciao.
Ciao
- Couldn't I? Maybe?
- What?
Supposing we split it?
And what would you get for it?
We'll think of something.
Why don't we just forget it, Caspar?
At least a kiss?
- At Lugo, may I say?
- What?
- You can say whatever you want.
- You see, they make fun of me.
Hooray! Hooray for Caspar! You're a real man.
How was it?
Oh, money, money, money when you've struck it, you know that you're in luck It's the battle of the buck that's all
When you got dough the boys will love you for that
And when it's gone they leave you flat.
Hooray for Caspar! You're a hero!
You're a swine!
Hey Adelmira, you're too old to appreciate such things!
Swines!
Every one of you, you're all swines!
Once upon a time...
a long, long time ago...
there was a mystical city, Tar.
And at that time...
all the cities were intact...
and flourishing.
Because the final war had not yet begun.
When the great catastrophe occurred...
all the cities crumbled...
except Tar.
Tar still exists.
If you know where to look for it, you will find it.
And when you get there...
you will be presented with wine and water...
and play with a gramophone.
When you get there, you will help harvest grapes...
and you will pick up scorpions hidden under white rocks.
When you get there...
you will know eternity.
You'll see a bird that drinks one drop of water...
from the ocean every hundred years.
When you get there, you'll understand life...
and you'll become a cat, phoenix, swan, elephant, baby and an old man.
You'll be alone and accompanied.
You'll love and be loved, sharing the same space...
and yours will be the seal of seals.
As you approach the future, you'll find...
Ecstasy.
It will overwhelm you and never abandon you.
The Tree Sought Refuge
In The Leaf
Let's play.
Okay, I'm a famous pianist.
If you're a famous pianist, and I cut off your arm... then what will you do?
I'll become a famous painter.
And if I cut off the other one, what will you do?
I'll become a famous dancer.
And if I cut off your legs, then what?
Then I'll become a famous singer.
And if I cut off your head, then what?
Once dead, my skin will become a beautiful drum.
What if I burn the drum?
I will become a cloud and take on any shape.
And if the cloud dissolves, what then?
I will become rain and produce a harvest of wars!
You win.
I'm going to miss you when you're gone.
If you ever feel too lonely... search for the magical city ofTar.
To Tar... To Tar...
So close and yet so far
To Tar... To Tar...
So close and yet so far
What a misfortune to be paralyzed.
It doesn't matter if you're paralyzed.
I'll take you everywhere.
How kind, Fando.
Fando, remember your letters when I was in the hospital?
I felt so special when
I received such long letters.
They were so tender.
And when you had nothing else to say... you sent me newspaper clippings to keep me from being alone.
How happy I was!
The tree disguised itself as a leaf, the house as a door... and the city as a house.
The same scene over and over.
The tree became a leaf, the house a door... and the city a house.
It was hard to see all that and not seek refuge in my hands.
Leave him alone!
Let me show you my world.
Come, follow him. Enter.
Sign here!
You'll stay here forever.
Here's the contract!
We'll run strings through your hands and feet
Here. All this money, it's yours.
Let me do that.
Let me go.
I can't remember anything.
I don't know what's wrong.
Please stay here with me.
What matters is where the wind comes from.
No, what matters is where wind goes to.
No, what matters is sleeping.
You're worrying about things that aren't important!
But this is important!
Who do you think you are to say what's important.
Look.
What a cute little girl.
What are you doing down there?
No! No!
Lay down with us.
Get away from me!
Let go!
Ha-ha. Look at her.
She can't move.
Nice legs.
Fando.
Hey!
Thanks for entertaining us.
When you're in the city of Tar, you'll know love...
and you'll ride on a horse with a falcon on your shoulder.
When you're there,you'll never see snow on the streets.
And you won't die... alone.
I will die
And no one will remember me
I will die
And no one will remember me
Yes, Lis. I'll remember you.
I'll visit your grave with a flower and a dog.
And at your funeral,
I'll sing in a low voice...
" How beautiful is a funeral. "
How beautiful is a funeral
How beautiful is a funeral
I'll visit your grave
With a flower and a dog
With a flower and a dog
Do you really love me, Fando?
Yes, Lis.
I don't want you to die.
End of the First Chant
And Tar Was Inside His Head
Is this the right way?
Let's see.
We're here.
To advance a mile, we only have to take a step.
IfTar doesn't exist, we can invent it.
You're right.
Lis, I want to do a world of things for you.
How many?
As many as I can.
Then you have to fight for life.
But, Lis,
I don't know why I should.
And if I knew, I don't think
I'd have the strength.
And if I had it, I don't know what good it would do anyway.
Try harder, Fando.
Everything seems so difficult, but you always have an answer.
No, not always.
Sometimes I pretend to have one.
But this isn't a game, Lis.
Yes, Fando.
I know it's no game.
There's no way out.
I think that's enough for now.
Hey! Come this way!
Ouch, it hurts.
You want to know who that is?
She's a beautiful child.
Is this the way to Tar?
If you think it is, then it is.
This is the way to Tar!
Look around.
There and there.
You'll see there's no day or night.
When you hear the beat of an immense drum... it'll be night.
Now those who sleep will get up and walk.
Here, try some.
It stinks!
- I'll put you in.
- No, I can't.
I know you can't walk, but you can stand up.
Don't leave me here, Fando.
Good-bye!
Come back, Fando.
Look how scared you are.
I am coming to get you.
Did you see that?
I'll buy you a boat when we get to Tar... and take it on the river.
Can you imagine, Lis?
Yes, Fando.
And I'll try to cure your sickness.
I don't want to see you suffer.
I want to have many children.
You're the best, Fando.
Do you want to hear a beautiful fable?
Like the one about a man and a paralyzed woman... on a little cart, and their journey to Tar.
Help me down, please.
Yes, Lis.
Look how beautiful it is here!
Do you like it?
Yes! I love it!
Look at the rocks!
Yes, Fando.
They're beautiful.
They're the most beautiful stones
I've ever seen.
Look at the flowers, Lis.
I don't see any, Fando.
It doesn't matter.
Look at them!
But there aren't any.
Don't cry.
I told you to look at the damn flowers!
Yes, Fando. I'm sorry.
What a crybaby!
It's beautiful here with all the flowers and trees.
Where do you see trees?
Right there on the path by the flowers.
You're too heavy.
There are flowers but no trees!
Yes, there are flowers and trees.
You're starting to be a pain in the ass.
You're hurting me.
I'm sorry, Fando.
I wish I could walk.
You want to walk?
There! You still haven't seen the flowers!
Have you? Have you?
Yes, I've seen them.
They're pretty, right?
Don't cry.
I'm not crying.
I'm sorry. Put me in the cart.
Fando, please.
I do so much for you, and all you do is cry!
I'm sorry, Fando.
One of these days I'll leave.
No, Fando.
Please don't leave me.
I have no one but you.
I'm leaving!
I'll never see you again.
Faggot!
Father. No.
Father.
Father.
Father.
End of the Second Chant
The Solitary Man
Is Always Accompanied
You're so smart, Lis.
But what good is that if you keep making me suffer?
No, Lis. I don't make you suffer.
On the contrary.
You're always telling me that.
But then you say you'll chain me down... so I can't move.
You make me cry.
Yes, Lis, you're right.
But I swear
I won't do it anymore.
You say you'll cure me when we get to Tar... but I don't believe you anymore.
I know. Kiss me, Lis.
This time I promise it's true.
I believe you.
A little blood for the love of God.
A bit of blood. for the love of God.
Have mercy on this poor blind man.
How nice of you.
Here, hold your arm out.
What about me?
Here you go, my son.
Lick it clean!
Have pity on the poor blind man.
A bit of blood for the love of God.
Kiss your mother. Come on.
She's about to die.
Here, my son. Eat!
Eat! You need to eat!
Eat!
Your mother will feed you until you explode.
You'll explode, but you'll be well fed.
Kiss your mom for the last time.
Do it.
I'm dying.
I don't have much time.
My admirers are waiting to see me die.
I belong to my fans.
I dedicate my death to my fans.
I perish for you.
Bravo! Bravo!
She's the best.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.
She's the best at dying.
What a performance.
Come and feel my body getting cold.
I've got a piece!
This is my final gift.
Watch.
When I wanted to, you couldn't.
When I didn't want to, you could.
Father! Father!
Kill me, my son.
Good-bye. Thank you for killing me.
Mama.
Careful. Watch your step.
Thank you...
Fando.
End of the Third Chant
And When I Wanted To Separate Myself
From Her...
She Told Me We Formed One Body
With Two Heads.
The feather was on the bed
The bed was on the feather
The feather, the feather...
The feather was on the bed
Look. She's pretty, very pretty.
It's true she's very pretty.
Stupendous!
Don't be afraid, miss.
It's okay.
Her skin is so soft.
No fatty tissue.
It's truly magnificent.
Unique. Touch her all over.
Exceptional body tone.
The best of all is when you kiss her.
Like this. Watch.
Caress her using both hands.
From head to toe.
Look at her beautiful toes.
And now, is she worthwhile?
Very much so.
Who is she?
She's my fiancée.
Hey! Don't leave like that!
Come back!
They're worthless!
All of them!
Don't cry.
I said don't cry!
You're the most useless girl in the world! Get dressed!
To Tar... To Tar.
Off we go to Tar
Take me off the cart.
Fando, I don't feel well.
You don't want to die now, do you?
I feel bad.
It seems like we're still in the same place.
We haven't gone anywhere.
Once, my mother forced me to lay down.
A priest made a hole in my head... and took out the stone of madness.
Sick, sick, ill...
- To chew, to command.
- To love.
- To masturbate...
- Mama...
You always lie to me.
Are you going to handcuff me now... even though I'm chained to the cart already?
No, I won't.
Kiss me, Lis.
You think you can fool me with a kiss?
Whose mouth am I going to kiss?
Look at my drum.
How beautiful.
- Round and beautiful.
- Yes, round and beautiful.
I only need it to sing you songs.
Sing the "feather song. "
The feather was on the bed
The bed was on the feather
I love it. Once we're in Tar, sing it to me all the time.
What did you take from your pocket? Show me.
I knew it.
You want to put me in handcuffs!
Don't try to deny it.
I knew it! I knew it!
I just want to play.
You've been playing all along.
No.
- Then get rid of them.
- No.
No, don't cry.
I love you.
Don't leave me, Fando.
I don't have anyone else.
- Oh, no, I won't leave you.
- Don't hurt me.
Hold me tight.
How cruel I am to you.
Give me your hands.
I said your hands.
I command you!
Damn, they're broken.
It's your fault!
The other hand! Now!
They're broken.
It's your fault.
Come here! Come here!
Crawl!
I can't go on...
My drum!
My drum!
You broke my drum!
You broke my drum!
No, Fando. I'm sorry.
Don't blame me.
Don't hate me.
Fando, don't hurt yourself.
Don't hurt yourself, Fando!
When you arrive at Tar...
you'll wear a golden crown upon your head.
And you'll possess the key...
that opens all the labyrinths.
I will die
And no one will remember me
No, Lis. I'll remember you.
I'll visit your grave with a flower and a dog.
During your funeral, I'll sing...
" How beautiful is a funeral. "
I'll do it for you, Lis.
Speak to me, Lis.
Speak to me, Lis.
When The Reflection
Faded Away In The Mirror...
It Gave Way
To The Word " Freedom. "
The communion of saints...
forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body...
and life everlasting.
Amen.
Let us pray.
Lord, have mercy upon us.
Christ, have mercy upon us.
Lord, have mercy upon us.
Amen.
Our Father.
Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed...
Dear God, there's something
I want to ask you.
Of course you know what it is... because you know everything that's going to happen before it happens... so there's really no need to ask you.
But I thought I'd ask you in any case.
Now, you know that I believe in you.
But I was wondering if you could give me just a little sign.
I mean, I'm not saying that if you don't give me the sign... that I won't believe in you... I'm not threatening you or anything like that.
But please, please give me enough courage...
to speak to Margaret Spencer and get to know her.
O God, make clean our hearts within us.
And take not thy holy spirit from us.
Miss Spencer...
I wonder if I could have a word with you.
There's something
I've got to tell you... something I've got to bring out into the open.
I've been bottling it up inside me too long... and there's no point in hiding it anymore.
For six years now, ever since you came to Wimpy's...
I've been in love with you.
I only live to hear your voice.
One cheeseburger, one shanty, one portion french fries.
Each time you speak... it's like a thousand violins playing in the halls of heaven.
I-I love you, Miss Spencer.
I love everything about you... the way you walk, your sweet smile, your easy grace and charm.
Wimpy Burgers twice, one M.R., one well, heavy on the onions.
I wish I could take you away from all this.
I'd like us to start a new life together... a little house of our own, a car, the two of us against the world... joined forevermore in holy wedlock.
Miss Spencer!
What?
Nothing.
Good evening.
I couldn't help noticing that you were making an unsuccessful suicide bid.
What are you doing in my room?
What do you want?
I'm here to help you, Mr. Moon.
- I don't want any help. Please go away.
- Oh, all right.
I just thought you might be interested in a little matter of a million pounds.
A million pounds?
Don't let me interfere with your doing away with yourself.
What's this about a million pounds?
- May I come in?
- Yes, please do.
Thank you. I wonder if you'd mind taking my cloak.
Hang it somewhere dry, would you.
- Might I sit down?
- Oh. Do.
Thank you.
- It's a very nasty little place you've got here.
- Oh. Thank you.
What's this about a million pounds?
Oh, a million pounds, yes.
You remember your great-great-great-grandfather?
Well, I never even met my father.
- How very sad.
- Excuse me.
In all events, your great-great-great- grandfather, Ephraim Moon... sailed for Australia in
1782 on a ship of the line.
Set himself up as an apothecary.
The business flourished... and by the time he died it was worth something in the region of £2,000.
A large amount in those days.
Yes.
Your great-great-grandfather,
Cedric Moon... by skillful management and careful husbandry... increased that sum a hundredfold.
This, in turn, was inherited by your great-grandfather, Desmond Moon... who expanded, diversified... and built up a personal fortune of well over a million pounds.
Oh. That's a lot of money.
A great deal of money, Mr. Moon.
And this gigantic sum... was inherited by your grandfather, Hubert Moon... who returned to London and frittered it away on wine, women and loose living.
Uh, where does that leave me then?
Penniless and on the brink of suicide.
You get out of here before I call the police.
Before you call the what?
The police.
You realize that suicide is a criminal offense.
In less enlightened times they'd have hung you for it.
Look, exactly what do you want?
I told you.
Seriously, I want to help you.
Unburden yourself. It does you good to share your problems.
What interest is it to you?
Please go away!
I'm interested in everybody.
Please tell me. What drove you to this desperate act?
All right, I'll tell you.
I'm miserable.
I've got a boring job, no money, no prospects...
I haven't got a girlfriend, I can't get to know anyone, no one wants to get to know me... and everything is hopeless.
All right? Satisfied?
And if you really want to help me, you can get me a sock for this pipe.
Oh, yes. They're in the top left-hand drawer, aren't they?
Yeah.
But suicide, Mr. Moon?
Really, really, really.
That's the last thing you should do.
Don't you think it's taking the easy way out?
Easy way out?
What's easy about it?
Look. The bleedin' pipe's broken.
Can't even manage to kill myself.
Let's face it, Mr. Moon... you're a complete failure.
Yes... Oh.
I'll fix that.
You know that million pounds I mentioned?
Yes?
I wasn't joking.
I could give you that and more.
Everything you've ever seen in the advertisements... fast, white convertibles... blonde women, their hair trailing in the wind... wafer-thin after-dinner chocolates.
If you had all that, would you be any happier?
What are you on about?
Would the words Prince of
Darkness mean anything to you?
Beelzebub? Mephistopheles?
The horned one?
I know. You've escaped from somewhere.
No, I haven't, Mr. Moon.
I'm the horned one, the devil.
Let me give you my card.
Oh, yes, the devil. Of course.
Silly old me.
Cor blimey!
I left my hankie at Wimpy's.
I wonder if you'll excuse me.
Don't rush away, Mr. Moon.
You're a nutcase.
You're a bleedin' nutcase.
They said the same of Jesus
Christ, Freud and Galileo.
They said it of a lot of nutcases too.
You're not as stupid as you look, are you, Mr. Moon?
What can I do to convince you that I'm the devil?
Supposing I granted you your dearest wish here and now?
What about that girl at Wimpy's?
Margaret Spencer?
Yes.
How do you know about her?
And how do you know so much about me... where my socks are and who my grandfather was?
I told you.
I've been taking an interest in you.
Look, well, supposing I, um... gave you a trial wish.
No obligation on your part.
Just to get acquainted.
Is there anything in the world you really desire?
Margaret Spen...
Aside from Margaret Spencer.
We'll save her till later, when you sign. Anything else?
Um... a Frobisher and Gleason raspberry-flavored ice lolly.
Very well, Mr. Moon.
Conclusively to prove that
I am indeed the unholy one... a Frobisher and Gleason raspberry-flavored ice lolly... shall be yours... in a trice.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Oh, um, have you got sixpence?
I've only got a million-pound note.
- Thank you.
- Ta.
Convinced?
Do me a favor.
I could have done that myself.
I thought you were gonna conjure it up.
You're just like all the rest, aren't you?
No proof is good enough.
I want a miracle.
A rain of toads or something.
All right then. Which of the cheap tricks is it gonna be?
Wine into water?
Stick into serpent?
How about flying through space at the speed of light?
How about you checking in to the nearest loony bin for a few weeks' holiday?
O ye of little faith, Moon.
You're not wearing nylon underwear, are you?
Why?
It disintegrates at high speeds.
Prepare yourself.
The magic words: I.B.J.
Here, my ice lolly's melted.
You really must be the devil.
Incarnate. How do you do?
Oh. How do you do?
Where are we? Is this hell?
Just my London headquarters.
That's not your name, is it?
George Spiggott?
Come on in. It's one of my many earthly pseudoplumes, or nom de nyms.
I thought you were called Lucifer.
I know. The Bringer of the
Light, it used to be.
Sounded a bit pouffy to me.
God keeps changing his name too, you know.
He used to be called the Word.
Yeah."ln the beginning was the Word."
"And the Word was God."
Was there just a word hanging about in space then?
I suppose so.
I wasn't there.
What's it mean,"the Word"?
What does"Stanley Moon" mean?
Evening, Anger.
It's all right, Anger.
He's with me.
Come in, Mr. Moon.
I'd like you to meet Anger.
He works for me.
How do you do?
Pleased to meet you.
Watch it, that's all.
This is the, uh, Club Room.
It's, uh, quite nicely decorated and painted. Early Hitler.
Now, what about my little proposition?
All I want from you is something you probably don't even realize you have.
I'm talking about your soul.
My soul?
Yes.
Like you collect moths...
I collect souls.
I'd like to add yours to my collection.
What are you doing?
Just a bit of routine mischief.
Now, then, what about your soul?
Well, uh, I don't know where it is or how to get hold of it.
Exactly.
And all I want from you is the exclusive global and universal rights to it.
But if you took it out, wouldn't it hurt?
It's a painless operation.
And afterwards, you won't feel a thing.
Besides, it's been no earthly good to you, has it?
Like to look at the contract?
Yes, please.
There we are.
Your soul's rather like your appendix... totally expendable.
There was a time when it did have a function... but nowadays the vast majority of people never use it.
Looks a bit complicated.
It's a standard contract.
Gives you seven wishes in accordance with the mystic rules of life... seven days of the week, seven deadly sins, seven seas, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.
Look, if you're not interested...
I'm sure there's thousands of others who'd jump at the opportunity.
No, it's just a bit sudden, that's all.
Read it through on your own time.
"I, Stanley Moon...
"hereinafter and in the hereafter... to be known as the damned..."
The damned?
It's a form of words. Legal jargon.
"Do warrant that I am the sole owner of my soul."
But what about Margaret? Do you promise that I'll have her all to myself?
Sign that... and Margaret Spencer... will be yours.
"Dear Miss Spencer, this is just to say cheerio.
"Yours sincerely, Stanley Moon.
P.S. I leave you my collection of moths."
Just how well did you know Mr. Moon?
Not at all, really.
I used to see him at Wimpy's.
Well, it does seem that, of all the people in his life, you were the closest to him.
Why else would he leave you that note?
I suppose that must be true.
How awful.
Have you any idea why he contemplated this rash act?
Can't say, really.
At work he always seems so calm and quiet.
Sorry to be so blunt,
Miss Spencer... but are you sure you're not concealing your relationship with the would-be deceased?
Wasn't a relationship.
I scarcely knew the man.
What are you doing all that measuring for?
Eh? Oh, we always do this, Miss Spencer.
You'd be amazed how often it pays off.
Now, did you say anything that might have upset him?
Can you remember your exact last words to him?
I think it was...
"Wimpy Burgers twice, one M.R., one well, heavy on the onions."
Yes, I think I'm beginning to get the picture.
- It all seems to be quite straightforward.
- Good.
All we need do now, then, is get it witnessed.
Sloth would be best. He's a lawyer.
Come on now, Sloth!
Wake up, you idle, great slob!
Here, are all your staff like this?
That's the trouble. I can't get any decent help these days.
God's laughing, of course.
All he has to do is raise his little finger... he's got a thousand sycophantic, prissy angels at his beck and call.
I'm lumbered with Anger and Sloth.
Wake up, you lazy, legal layabout!
Get up! Wake up!
Here, well, this is Stanley Moon.
He's selling me his soul, and I want you to witness it on this document.
I want you to do some writing.
That's your forte, isn't it?
Writing.
Where it says,"ln the presence of," your signature.
Your name. Remember that one?
Y... Yeah.
Sloth.
S... I...
S... I...
O... T...
O... T...
T... H.
Right. Very nice.
Now it's your turn.
Um... there's just one thing, though.
You're not having second thoughts, are you?
No. But shouldn't I sign in blood?
Blimey, you are a traditionalist.
All right then.
Let's use some of his.
He'll never notice.
There we are. Help yourself.
Well done.
Welcome to the club.
- When can I get started on my wishes?
- Soon as you like.
And if, by any chance, you become dissatisfied... all you have to do is go...
Just go...
You just go...
This'll terminate your wish and bring you back to me, wherever I am.
Here we are. "M."
Let's see, um...
Machiavelli, McCarthy,
Masoch, Miller, Moses...
- Moses?
- Irving Moses, the fruiterer.
Here's Moon. S. Moon.
That's you filed away.
Now then, what would you like to be first? Prime minister?
Oh, no, I've made that deal already.
Um, I don't know, really.
It's just that I'm not very good with words.
I didn't have very much of an education.
And... And I'm a bit, um...
Uh...
Um, I'm just a bit...
Inarticulate?
Yes, that's it... I think.
And you'd like to be the sort of person who can use words like "inarticulate"?
Yeah! I'd like to be able to talk to
Margaret and tell her how I feel.
An intellectual who can get his ideas across to the one he loves.
Yes, that's it.
Easily done.
Now then, you just stand over here by the bird... put your right hand on its left claw.
Okay, lights out!
Take this!
Ooh! Ooh!
Am I gonna explode?
No, no, it's quite safe. I just put it there for a bit of visual excitement.
It's not gonna hurt, is it?
Not a bit.
Hold tight!
The magic words:
Julie Andrews.
I could stand and watch them for hours.
They've such beautiful hands.
Mmm.
Such fantastic delicacy, you see... but combined as well with this almost preternatural strength.
Doesn't it make you sad to see animals caged up like this?
Well, in a way, but, uh... quite honestly, they're really no worse off than most of us.
How do you mean?
Well, metaphorically speaking... and in a very real sense... society creates its own cages.
You know, cages of the mind.
Yes. Yes.
A curious kind of cerebral captivity.
Buy a flower, madam?
Oh! Um, what's it for?
Depraved criminals.
You see, civilization... has had the effect of... inhibiting our deepest... natural animal instincts, you see.
Mmm.
The conventions of an ordered society... have made us lose what Freud calls our urmenschgefuhnaturlichkeit.
Well, it's a bit of a mouthful, isn't it?
Must have been a marvelous man.
Oh, yes. One of the seminal forces.
Um, as Rousseau said... we must learn to unlearn... because only by unlearning can we really learn to be.
Your ideas are so exciting!
Oh!
What a... fabulous room!
It's marvelous!
Do you like it?
Oh, I love it.
It's so right.
I mean, it's you!
The moment I walked in, everything about it says Stanley.
Well...
This room is you.
It's a bit untidy, bit of a mess... but we bachelors have to fend for ourselves, you know.
Brahms! I can't believe it!
You too?
Mmm.
Ohh.
Absolutely adore him.
Mmm.
He has a... virile romanticism that
I find irresistible.
Oh, Brahms is just so fantastic!
Whenever I feel tense or anything...
I put him on, just sprawl on the carpet and let him flow all over me.
- Would you like a little taste of him now then?
- Please!
Not that I'm tense or anything.
It's just that it would make me even less tense.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm!
Go on.
Lie down.
Oh, uh, I didn't mean...
Whew!
Let it happen.
Oh.
Mmm.
I love the way he brings the flute in there.
That is a French horn, actually.
Oh. How silly of me.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Goodness gracious.
The French horn can sound incredibly like a flute, you know.
In fact, not many people notice... the flute-like qualities of a French horn.
It's so sensual and evocative.
Mm-hmm.
One can almost see the trees... and the sunlight dappling through.
And a little brook.
Mmm.
And what's that?
A powerful, young stag... darts into the clearing... raises his antlers... and edges closer to his doe.
Oh, that record was new this morning.
Where did you get that fantastic thing?
It is nice, isn't it?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Mmm. I got it off a stall, actually.
Just saw it there and had to have it.
I'm rather like that, you know.
I see something I want... and that's it, boy-o.
Have to have it.
Me too.
Yes, you too.
Mmm.
Have a look at it.
Oh, thank you.
Oh!
Bit of a weight, isn't it?
Oh, it's so smooth... and cool.
Yes, that's the extraordinary thing about marble.
It's always 11 degrees cooler... than the air that surrounds it.
Fahrenheit, of course.
Do you like feeling things?
Oh, yes,
I'm a very... tactile person.
I love touching things.
Sometimes...
I go into the forest... and shut my eyes... and just wander around touching trees and grass and boulders.
Y-You should try it.
Do it in here!
Go on. Shut your eyes.
Now feel something hard.
Oh.
Ohh!
Oh, I'm feeling something terribly hard. It's fantastic.
Oh, now feel something soft.
Oh.
Oh, my goodness gracious me.
Oh, it's unbelievable.
Oh, the contrast.
I've never felt anything so exciting in my life.
Yeah. I love it. Feel my tie.
Oh!
Mmm.
Oh. It's delicious!
Yeah?
Velvet.
It's so wild.
It really does something to me.
Oh. Uh...
Hmm.
I suppose after all that touching you could do with something to drink.
Please!
What would you like?
Cinzano.
Cinzano? Fantastic.
One sip of Cinzano, and I'm in Italy.
Mmm.
The freedom of it.
The sun beating down.
Mmm.
The incredible thing about the Italians is the way they touch each other.
Have you noticed that?
Yes. Cheers.
The Anglo-Saxons have lost the art of touching each other.
I mean, if someone wants to touch somebody else... then they should go right ahead and touch them.
I mean, it's a healthy, human thing to do.
Y-You're so right.
There's a tribe in... in Africa who never say a word.
They just touch each other.
That's how they communicate.
Life is far too complicated.
I think we should get down to basic elements.
Mmm.
I mean...
For example, if you were a girl, and I...
I am a girl.
Well, of course!
All right, but if... if you were a girl... which, of course, you are... and if I were a man, which, for argument's sake, let's say I am... and I wanted to touch you, well...
I wouldn't feel restrained.
I mean, I'd just go right ahead... and... touch you.
You see? That's how I am.
I feel the same way.
I mean, if two adult human beings want to touch each other... they should go ahead and touch each other.
Why hold back?
Yes.
This afternoon has been... so perfect.
The Cinzano. The zoo.
The music. The touching.
And you're so right about the animals.
I mean, that's what we are... deep down, underneath our sophisticated civilization... and we should behave like they do.
Of course.
I mean, the fact that it's... seven minutes past 3:00 in the afternoon wouldn't make any difference to a goat.
I mean, Old Billy wouldn't stop to think what time of day it was, would he?
No, it just goes right ahead and does what it feels like.
I mean, really, what are people waiting for?
I want to live!
That's what matters... living.
I want to do everything, be everything... feel everything...
Rape! Rape!
No, no! Margaret! Margaret!
The animals! The goats!
The touching!
Rape! Rape! Rape!
What's going on in there? Open the door!
Aah! Ohh! Ooh!
Owwww!
Rape! Aah!
Hello, Stanley.
I won't be a minute.
- Get me down from here.
- You're quite safe.
It's only a 300-foot drop.
What am I doing in this costume?
I thought you ought to dress for the occasion.
Come on, my darling.
Out you come.
There we are.
What did you say?
I just said...
- What's that mean?
- It's pigeon talk.
I'm just issuing instructions.
I'm going for a double tempt, actually.
Like to come and watch?
- No.
- Come over here.
No need to be frightened.
You won't fall. I'll hold on to your belt, if you like.
Up you come.
There we are.
Now, you see that man over there?
Yes.
And do you see this pigeon?
Yes.
Well, this is a classic double tempt situation.
With a bit of luck, I can get two sins for the price of one... spite from the perpetrating pigeon and anger from the victim!
It's terrific!
Are you trying to tell me you want that pigeon... to do his doo-dahs on that man's head?
That's right.
All right, birdie, remember what I said.
Target in range.
All systems... go!
Release your doo-dahs
What a pathetic thing to do.
If you're the devil, why didn't you go for that vicar down there?
Oh, no. He's one of ours.
Is this your idea of having fun?
Tempting pigeons?
Banal as it may seem,
Stanley, it is my job.
I don't know.
If it hadn't been for you... we'd still be blissfully wandering about naked in paradise.
You're welcome, mate.
The Garden of Eden was a boggy swamp just south of Croydon. You can see it over there.
Adam and Eve were happy enough.
I'll tell you why... they were pig ignorant.
Come on, my darling. Out you go, and do something really nasty.
Oh, how'd you get on with Margaret Spencer?
I was wondering when you'd ask me that.
It was terrible.
I was so frustrated.
I had all these words and ideas... and she listened to them and agreed with them... but when I touched her she screamed.
Let me tell you something, Stanley.
As far as sex is concerned, patience is a virtue.
I wanted her so much
I just couldn't wait.
Let me give you a tip. Come here.
In the words of Marcel Proust... and this applies to any woman in the world... if you can stay up and listen with a fair degree of attention to whatever garbage... no matter how stupid it is... that they're coming out with... till 10 minutes past 4:00 in the morning, you're in.
Ten minutes past 4:00 in the morning, and you're there?
It never fails.
Oh, that Margaret's such a... gorgeous girl.
Isn't she lovely?
I'd like to know what she's doing right now.
Well, that can be arranged.
Let's just get this out.
What's that?
Galileo's wonderful little invention.
Have you got sixpence?
Yes.
Have a peer through that.
There we are.
Wha...
Come on, Roberts.
Put your back into it!
It's very good of you to spend so much time on this.
Shh. Oh, that's why we're here,
Miss Spencer... to help people out.
Or fish people out, rather.
Excuse me, Miss Spencer.
People get the wrong idea about the police.
We're all human beings as well, you know.
No, we like the public to think of us as their friends.
I'm sure we all do, Inspector.
Why don't you call me Reg?
All right, Reg.
And you must call me Margaret.
Here, she told him to call her Margaret.
I think she fancies him a bit.
Shut up!
Oh, I do hope they don't find Stanley down there.
He was such a...
Quick, it's run out!
Give me another sixpence.
Ooh-ooh! Ooh-ooh! Ah! Ooh-ooh!
I haven't got one!
Ohh!
Oh, I know she was gonna say something nice about me.
Oh, let me have her now.
I must have her now. Please!
Just tell me who, where, when, under what circumstances.
Margaret is who, of course, but I don't want to go through courting again... that was awful.
Why not be married to her? Then you'll be absolutely certain of having her.
Yeah. A-And I'd like to be powerful,
'cause I'd like to give her lots of things.
Rich. Influential. Millionaire.
Multi.
Multi. Good thinking.
Multimillionaire. Yachts, servants, country estates, a phone in the lav.
Yeah, but I don't want her to be like she was last time... you know, timid.
I want her to be... physical.
I'll make her very physical, indeed, for you, Stanley.
Stiffen yourself.
The magic words: Jackie Kennedy!
Oh, well. Julie Andrews.
Randy!
Afternoon, Seed.
Hello, everybody. How are you, Peter?
Sorry I'm late, darling.
Mmm! Hello, Randolph.
Hello.
Brought you a little something from town.
Do you like it?
Yes. Isn't it lovely, Randy?
Yes.
We're playing croquet.
Why don't you and Peter go away... and discuss your affairs?
True enough.
I suppose we ought to... tie up this Venezuelan business.
Yes.
Lord Dowdy, I wonder if you'd be so kind as to take over my blue ball... and double up with Daphne.
C-C-C-C-C-Certainly.
Who is that young Randy fellow?
What?
Oh. Randolph.
He's an awfully nice chap.
He's, uh... He's teaching
Margaret the harp.
Oh, yes.
She's terribly artistic, you know.
Is she?
Yes. Terribly.
Artistic?
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes.
We met Randolph, actually, when we were in the Bahamas... forming Margaret's mother into a limited company.
Very shrewd move.
You ever thought of making Margaret into a charitable institution?
What a cracking wheeze!
Yes, and then I could get a depreciation allowance on her.
Exactly. I think the revenue boys would buy that one.
Yes.
You could probably get her clothes taken off as well.
Yes, I'm sure they'd be deductible.
Properly handled, I think she could be a wonderful little asset.
Yes.
I was shopping around for a wife, actually, the other day.
Mmm. Daphne?
Or something along similar lines.
But my accountant said that in my bracket it really wasn't on.
Oh, yes... Oh, yes... Come on!
Yes. Excuse me.
I forgot to give you this, my precious!
Oh, you doll!
There we are. Do you like it?
Oh!
Well!
Feel the fur, Randolph.
Mmm. Beautiful.
How is the old harp... harp coming along?
Oh, splendidly.
Your wife has extraordinary sensitivity.
She has, she has. Extraordinary.
Oh, I'm so hot and sticky and...
Randy, we must have a dip!
Your wife has a very beautiful body.
It is nice, isn't it?
You must be a very happy man.
Yes.
Yes, I must be.
I find her... fantastically attractive.
Hmm.
Thank you.
You don't mind my saying that.
My dear chap. Good Lord.
Not at all. Not at all.
I imagine everybody does.
I imagine they do. Yes.
Sex is a terribly thorny subject, isn't it?
Mmm. Tsk-tsk-tsk.
Terribly thorny.
Very thorny subject.
I don't really need it.
Yes, please.
I always think it very ironical... that the male of the species reaches his sexual peak at the age of 14.
Mmm.
Whereas the appetite of the female... continues to increase with the passing years.
Yes.
Hmm.
It is ironic, isn't it?
Bloody ironic.
Ah.
Of course, monogamy isn't a natural state for any animal.
Good Lord, no.
Goodness gracious, no. No.
When I say "animal," I mean man.
Yes.
- And when I say "man," I mean woman, of course.
- Of course.
You see, he... or, for that matter, she... is, um... fundamentally promiscuous.
Now.
Yes.
Yes, she probably is.
How does that feel?
Excuse me.
Darling! Darling!
Mmm?
I forgot to give you this, dear heart.
How exciting. What is it?
Boo-boo-boo-boo!
You shouldn't have.
Is it the original?
Yes. I thought it might appeal.
Thank you, dear. You are sweet.
Oh, good!
And now we must go and get out of our wet things.
Come along, Randy.
Beautiful collection of books you've got here, Stanley.
Must be worth a packet.
Yes, I caught a rather nasty cold in blue chips last week... and my broker's advised me to switch to first editions.
They're going up all the time.
Yes.
That one's worth about £10 more than it was when we came in.
Forgive my ignorance,
B-B-B-Bagshot... b-but what are y-y-y-you in?
Missiles and munitions, mainly.
Mmm.
How's the market holding up?
Well, we've been very badly hit by this peace scare.
We fell four points yesterday.
Luckily, I managed to off-load... a lot of obsolete rubbish... on the freedom fighters.
Yet things still look rather dodgy.
S-S-S-Surely i-i-i-i-it's... only a t-t-t-temporary... s-s-s-s-setback.
That's very easy for you to say, Lord Dowdy.
But it only takes two lunatics... to sit down and sign a piece of paper... and we could be plunged into a nuclear peace so devastating... that my company, for one, would be wiped out completely.
Where's that harp coming from?
It's probably Margaret playing with Randolph... in the music room.
They're very good together, aren't they?
Yes, they certainly are.
I often wish I'd been forced to take up an instrument myself when I was young.
I must say, I, uh, admire the way... you allow her such freedom.
I think most husbands would object to their wives... being alone in a room with a handsome... virile young man.
Well, it is the 20th century, after all, old boy.
Can't expect to possess anyone body and soul.
Huh.
Wonder why the... music stopped.
They've probably come to the end of their first movement.
Your shot, Stanley.
Yes. Yes.
Um... Ah-ta-ta-ta.
Uh, l-l-I'll just pop along and, uh, uh... see if they need anything before, uh... they start their, um, next... movement.
Oh.
Uh, hello, Randolph.
Have you seen anything of my wife at all?
Not recently.
I thought she was with you.
Yes. Probably is. Probably is, yes.
Yes.
Probably... with...
Probably with me.
Oh. Um, where's Peter got to?
H-H-He said s-s-s... s-s-something had c-c-c-c... come up.
Come up?
Something come up? Yes.
Y-Y-Your sh-shot.
My shot. Yes. Yes, my shot.
Yes, you're certainly right there.
Gosh. My shot. Yes.
Oh, blast!
Gosh.
Seem to have broken me cue.
Um... won't use any of those.
Rubbishy old things.
I'll just... just go and get my special one.
Um, Margaret'll know where to lay her hands on it!
Margaret, my darling! My precious!
My sweet? My love? Margaret!
Seed!
Sir?
Oh. Uh, have you seen
Lady Margaret, Seed?
Her Ladyship is in the bathroom, sir.
In the bathroom, Seed.
Jolly good.
Oh. Hello, Peter. Hello, darling.
Uh, s... sorry to butt in like this, Peter... but, um, uh... about this Venezuelan business...
I thought we ought to get it, uh, tied up one way or the other.
Um, uh... do you want me to come in with you on it... or, um, do you... do you wish to pull out... or shall we just call the whole thing, um...
Aaah!
Hello, Stanley.
Just tap this for me, would you?
What are we doing up here?
Trapping a few wasps.
Wasps? Blimey!
Come on, my darlings.
Come on, my beastlies.
Out of the nest, into the jar. Come on.
How'd it go, Stanley?
You know perfectly well how it went.
That Bagshot bloke looked exactly like you.
Well, there's a lot of me in everyone.
It was even worse than the last time.
I've never been so miserable.
Wasn't she physical enough?
She was physical, all right.
She was too physical.
She was physical all over the place, except with me.
Oh, don't be too hard on her.
Fornication's such a puny sin.
What she did to me was unforgivable.
You're just like all my clients.
Absolutely typical.
If Margaret had come in and told you she'd murdered the gardener... you'd have forgiven her, shielded her from the police.
Just because she has a bit of harmless fun with some young man... doesn't do anybody any damage... you want to strangle her.
You're a complete hypocrite.
I thought you were gonna make me happy.
I never promised you that.
That's up to you.
I just gave you seven wishes for one measly little soul.
I'm only doing me job.
Your job?
Making people miserable?
No! Giving them the chance to be happy. It's God's idea.
Don't confuse me with religion.
You see, his theory... and I'm not knocking it... is that in order for people to be really good... they have to make a free choice between good and evil and choose good.
Look.
I'm a vital part of his plan.
I provide the evil.
Wasps!
Wasps! Wasps!
Oh, you rotten, nasty-minded troublemaker.
Ohh!
Those nice, gentle flower people grooving along quietly... and you had to mess it up.
You could do something about it.
How?
Why don't you give them one of your wishes?
Well, because they're mine, and
I've only got five of 'em left.
Not falling for any more of your tricks, thank you very much.
Well, just as you like.
Let's go. More work to be done.
What a dreary thing to do.
I hope you're proud of yourself.
It was pride that got me into this.
I used to be an angel, you know, up in heaven.
- Oh, yeah. You used to be
God's favorite, didn't you?
- That's right.
"I Love Lucifer" it was, in those days.
What was it like in heaven?
Very nice, really.
We used to sit around all day and adore him.
Believe me, he was adorable.
Just about the most adorable thing you ever did see.
Well, what went wrong then?
I'll show you.
Here we are.
Give me a leg up, would you?
Now, then...
I'm God.
This is my throne, see.
All around me are the cherubim, seraphim... continually crying,"Holy, holy, holy"... the angels, archangels, that sort of thing.
Now you be me, Lucifer, the loveliest angel of them all.
- What do I do?
- Well, sort of dance around praising me, mainly.
- What sort of things do I say?
- Anything that comes into your head that's nice.
How beautiful I am, how wise, how handsome, that sort of thing.
Come on. Start dancing.
You're wise, you're beautiful You're handsome
Thank you very much.
The universe
- What a wonderful idea.
Take my hat off to you.
- Thank you.
Trees, terrific.
Water, another good one.
That was a good one.
Yes! Sex... top marks.
Now make it more personal.
A bit more fulsome, please.
Come on.
Immortal, invisible.
You're handsome, you're, uh, you're glorious.
Thank you. More!
You're the most beautiful person in the world
Here, I'm getting a bit bored with this.
Can't we change places?
That's exactly how I felt.
I only wanted to be like him... and have a few angels adoring me.
He didn't see it like that.
Pride, he called it. Sin of pride.
Flew into a monumental rage, chucked me out of heaven, gave me this miserable job.
Just 'cause I wanted to be loved.
I had no idea.
It's a very sad story.
I suppose he had his reasons.
Oh, can't you stop?
It's a compulsion!
I'm compelled to. His orders.
Pathetic.
He moves in a very mysterious way, you know.
Here, that's terrible!
But apart from the way he moves, what's God really like?
I mean, what color is he?
He's all colors of the rainbow... many-hued.
But he is English, isn't he?
Oh, yes. Very upper-class.
Course his son had a lot of problems, having such a famous father.
I always felt sorry for Jesus having his birthday on Christmas Day.
Just one lot of presents.
That's a bad day's work.
Oh, no. He's in here again.
Come on, Vanity, you worthless old sin!
Stop preening! Get back and tidy up your men's room!
How could he see where he's going?
He can't.
What rotten sins I've got working for me.
I suppose it's the wages.
Anyway, enough of my problems.
Sit down.
Thank you.
You must be exhausted after all that business with Margaret.
Jealousy really takes it out of you, doesn't it?
Think things over before you decide on your next wish.
Don't rush into it.
Have a bit of kip.
Things'll seem clearer in the morning.
You can use my bed if you like.
Slip into this.
Oh. Where will you sleep then?
Oh, don't worry about me.
I never do.
I had a fitful doze in the Middle Ages.
Since then, nothing.
- Go on. You can change through there.
- Thank you.
It's very kind of you to lend me your room and your bed like this.
You're the first person who's ever shown any concern for me... and you're the devil.
I mean, God's never taken any interest in me, as far as I can see.
Of course not. He never pushes himself forward. Prefers to work subliminally.
It's the oldest trick in the game, your soft-sell technique.
Well, I wish he would push himself forward and help people a bit... and prove he was there.
Well, in God's view, for what it's worth... this would interfere with your freedom of choice.
Freedom of choice?
What sort of freedom of choice did
I have about where I was born... and what size I was... and what a bloody awful job I landed myself in?
If we really had freedom of choice... we should be able to decide who are parents are, what we look like and everything.
- I couldn't agree more.
- Then why the hell doesn't he do something about it?
God knows.
Well, that's very handsome, I must say.
- It's a bit long.
- Suits you down to the ground.
Looks very good on you.
Actually, um, red's not really my color.
I'm normally a bit more conservative.
But it's very nice though.
In you get.
You know, Mr. Spiggott... you're really the first person who's ever taken the trouble to talk to me.
I like you... but you keep on doing these terrible things.
It's nothing personal.
Well, if you say so.
Good night, Stanley.
Good night, Mr. Spiggott.
Call me George.
Oh. Good night, George.
Good... morning, Mr. Moon.
- Morning?
- I've brought y'all somethin'.
To eat.
Thank you.
It's so hot in here.
Whew!
Would you, uh, help me with my buttons?
I seem to be all thumbs this mornin'.
Oh!
I find clothes so constrictin'.
We must allow our pores to breathe.
That's better!
Can you hear my pores breathe?
Listen.
Would you like a nibble?
Why, you must be ravenous.
Would you like orange juice?
Um...
Or... a succulent, sun-ripe, whole... pineapple?
But you have to be careful of the prickles.
Oh, I will.
Do you like it in bed?
Uh, uh, yes.
Good. So do I!
Look up there.
Don't we make a pretty pair?
Yes.
Coffee?
Um, yes.
Strong, black and sweet.
Two mountainous spoons full.
Hot toast or buttered buns?
- Either.
- Oh, I love a man who knows what he wants.
Do you crave marmalade or honey?
Honey.
Ohh!
I do so love the smell of honey on a man's lips.
Come on now, Lily.
Up you get.
Pick your clothes up. You're due down at the Foreign Office.
Good-bye, Mr. Moon.
Let's get together soon.
Um, who was that?
Didn't she introduce herself? That's
Lilian Lust, the babe with the bust.
Oh. She's quite nice, really.
She's a very sweet, warm, wonderful human being. I'll say that for her.
Mmm. You know, I...
You're quite right. I do see things much more clearly this morning.
Thought you would.
I was... thinking about that girl Lilian.
You know, she's...
Shh! Stanley.
I wouldn't mess around with married women if I were you.
Oh. She married?
Yes. Tragic business.
Completely incompatible.
You met the husband... Sloth.
So that's it then? She's out?
Afraid so.
But can I... can I be someone who women... yearn after and crave for and lust after?
You'd like to be young and sexy and dynamic... and have beautiful women hurl themselves at your feet.
Yeah, that's it. But most of all, it's gotta be Margaret.
I want Margaret lusting after me.
I'll tell you what people go mad for these days. That's your pop stars.
I can just see you, Stanley, standing there in your skintight pants... the music pounding, the women screaming, Margaret laughing... the drums throbbing out with their incessant animal beat!
Let me have it!
Julie Andrews!
Oh, Stanley!
Stanley!
Oh!
I love you, Stanley!
Oh, Stanley!
Oh!
And now, this year's most exciting discovery...
Drimble Wedge and the Vegetation!
Oh!
Oh, hello, Stanley.
Nice to have you back so soon.
I won't be a moment.
Hello. You've just cut me off.
I was talking to Tokyo.
Do you really love me?
Of course I do, you jerk!
Get off my line!
I thought you were supposed to be my friend.
All that talk.
Your bed and that girl this morning.
You just put her there to get me all excited and confused so I'd make the wrong decision.
What happened?
What happened.
It finished before it started.
That's what happened.
They're like that these days, your pop fans, aren't they? Very fickle.
Mrs. Fitch?
Speaking.
Abercrombie here.
I work with your husband.
Oh, yes?
I thought you'd like to know he's just checked in to the Cheeseborough Hotel, Brighton... with his secretary, Fiona.
- Good-bye.
- What a putrid thing to do.
Why did I get myself into such a mess?
Let me answer that by asking you a question.
In the words of the great
Zen master, Li Kwi Kwat...
"If you were hanging from a cliff by your fingernails...
"and above you was a raging tiger baring his fangs...
"and below you was the tiger's mate, baring her fangs... what would you do?"
What a stupid question!
Cliffs and tigers. I wouldn't get myself into such a ridiculous situation.
Oh, of course not.
You've got the secret.
You're far better off.
Here you are, halfway up a pole in Berkshire... damned in the hereafter for eternity, half your wishes gone.
You've nothing to learn from Li Kwi
Kwat and his tigers, have you?
Hello. Mrs. Phelps?
Hello. Yes?
Mrs.Jonathan Phelps?
Yes.
Mrs.Jonathan Phelps of 8 Puseley
Rise, Hounslow, Middlesex?
Yes.
Did I get you out of the bath to answer the phone?
Yes, you did.
Sorry. Wrong number.
Your tricks are so bloomin' dismal.
I know, Stanley. Don't rub it in.
I've lost me spark.
There was a time when I used to get lots of ideas.
I was creative, original.
I thought up the seven deadly sins in one afternoon.
The only thing I've come up with recently is advertising.
Blimey! We're due at Mrs. Wisby's.
Hurry up. Let's get changed.
You're so dull, the way you go about things.
Everything you do is third-rate.
Pass me over me britches.
There's a good chap.
"Pass me my britches." The Prince of Darkness changing his britches in a G.P.O. van.
What's the matter with you? Where's your style? Use your magic powers.
I daren't waste those. I've got to save all that up for my struggle with him.
I thought you were supposed to be his equal.
Huh! That'll be the day.
For a start, he's omnipresent.
What do you mean?
I only mean he's everywhere, all over the world, at the same time.
That's all I mean.
I'm just highly maneuverable.
So he's in here right now.
Of course he is.
He's in the van. He's in the can.
He's up the trees.
He's in the breeze.
He's in your hair. He's everywhere.
Spying on you, peering at you, listening to everything you say.
There's no privacy for anyone. Get out of here while I'm changing, can't you?
You won't get anywhere by shouting at him, you know.
You're quite right, of course.
I'll try the humble approach.
Excuse me, Your
Ineffable Hugeness.
I wonder if you'd be gracious enough to step outside for a moment... while we miserable worms get our drawers on.
I can't say you sounded very sincere, mate.
Here! What's your game?
I wanted to give him a bit of a turn.
I saw him nestling in your trousers.
Good afternoon, madam.
We're the Froony Green Eyewash men.
Have you, by any chance, got 10 bottles of Froony Green Eyewash in your house?
Oh, no. I'm afraid I haven't.
Oh, what a pity, 'cause if you had and could answer a simple question... you'd have won a beautiful silver tea service... and a night on the town with Alfred Hitchcock.
Oh, what a shame.
Never mind.
Look, I'll tell you what.
Nobody will ever know the difference.
Why don't you nip down to the shops, buy 10 bottles of Froony Green Eyewash... come back here as quickly as you can... and I'll pretend you had them all the time.
You're very kind.
Hurry back now.
Let's get something to eat.
Let's see what we've got.
Very nice.
Raspberries, cream, sugar.
Ideal combination for a lovely summer afternoon.
Oh, leave her a few.
I need them more than she does.
I'm so depressed.
This job, it's really getting me down.
What have you... What have you got to be depressed about?
I mean, look on the bright side.
Think of all your successes.
Sodom and Gomorrah.
Short-lived, Stanley. Short-lived.
Besides, as soon as I get a really swinging scene going... he butts in with his fire and brimstone.
He's a very destructive, unpredictable person.
Is that why you can't insure against acts of God?
Exactly. As if that isn't enough, I've got last-minute repentance to contend with.
- That doesn't sound too much of a threat.
- Not much of a threat?
Do you realize I can spend 50 or 60 years working on a client... making him vain, greedy, lustful, slothful, the lot... and then just when he's breathing his last, he goes and bloody repents?
- I lost Mussolini that way.
- Really?
At the moment they're putting the noose around his neck, he says, "Scusi. Mille regrette."
Up he goes. Psst!
Here they are. Ten bottles of Froony's Green Eyewash.
I just got in before they closed.
Well done, Mrs. Wisby.
Now all you have to do is answer one very simple question.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
How tall is the Duke of Edinburgh?
Oh, dear.
Let me see. I saw it somewhere.
Six foot one, is it?
Alas, no.
The correct answer is six foot two... and this means you've lost £10.
Terribly sorry, Mrs. Wisby.
Better luck next time.
Come on, Stanley. Off we go.
Good-bye!
That poor old lady.
How can you be so mean?
That grasping, greedy old bag?
She didn't mind the idea of cheating Froony's.
Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you something about Margaret Spencer.
What's that?
She's dead.
- No, she's not.
- No, she's not.
She's not?
No, she's alive.
Then why did you say that?
Malice. I'm a liar. I do it the whole time. I can't help it.
Are you telling me that everything you've ever said is a lie?
Everything I've ever told you has been a lie, including that.
- Including what?
- That everything I've ever told you has been a lie.
That's not true.
I don't know what to believe.
Not me, Stanley. Believe me.
Listen, you tell me one thing, and it better be true.
What is Margaret Spencer doing right now?
Scout's honor, Stanley.
She's with that powerfully built Inspector Clark.
She's very concerned about you.
Oh, I'd like to be in the room with them.
Wish I was a fly on the wall.
Julie Andrews!
You rotten bas...
You've tricked me again!
That wasn't meant to be a wish!
I only did what you said.
Blow a raspberry.
Not yet.
I want to see what's going on.
And why are you here with me?
I want to protect you, Stanley.
I like you.
I'd hate to see you swatted.
Shut up. Here she comes.
Lovely weather we've been having.
Lovely.
Of course, we've been kept pretty busy.
It's the summer frocks. I've had three rapes on my hands this morning.
- Is that a lot?
- Oh, round about the seasonal average.
That's a nice dress you're wearing.
I don't like his attitude.
I've always had mixed feelings about rape.
I mean, half the time, it's the, uh... the girls... that have led things on.
I agree with you.
They bring it on themselves, you know. They really do.
I'm so happy he's not here.
But we must find him before he kills himself.
She noticed me! She noticed me!
Well.
Thank you, lads.
Not him?
Oh, it's cold in here.
He seemed a cut above the others.
There was something different about him.
A special quality.
He put so much into those cheeseburgers.
He was a real artist.
Yes, but like so many of your artistic types... unable to cope with life, he took the coward's way out.
He called me a coward!
The vice squad is having a bit of a do tonight.
Would you like to come along?
Will I be allowed?
An outsider?
Of course!
They asked us to bring along a girlfriend.
You'd soon feel at home.
I'm gonna break this up!
But you've never flown before.
You can't go up alone.
Oh, yes, I can.
I'll take him first. You follow.
The Vice Squad is usually having a first-class get-together.
Flap them, Stanley!
Not your legs, your wings!
You've got lovely lips.
Very tempting and alluring.
"Lorelie lips" is what I call 'em.
Has anyone ever said that before?
No, never.
Here I come, Stanley!
I don't want to alarm you... but I'd say that lips like that would be a magnet to sex maniacs.
Really?
Oh!
Oh! Oh!
Damn flies!
Oh, it's a whopper!
Oh, let's get out of this fly trap.
Blow your raspberry.
I can't, with these terrible fly's lips!
Quick, blow your raspberry!
She noticed me, George.
She noticed me.
I must have her before she goes to that terrible vice party with the police.
- That's what I'm here for.
- I want her to be in love with everything about me.
Madly in love with me!
Look, Stanley.
I feel terribly bad about the way
I've tricked you in the past.
I want to be nice to you this time. Really nice to you. I mean it. I'd like to help you.
I've been thinking about your problem.
What I think you need is the simple life.
How does this strike you?
You and Margaret are both warm, tender, loving people.
Picture a little cottage in the country.
Two beautiful children are playing in the sunlit garden.
Margaret's in the kitchen, preparing the anniversary dinner.
She hears you drive up in the car.
She's madly in love with you and you with her.
She's bursting with the anticipation of seeing you at the end of the day.
By George, you've got it.
I think you've got it.
Julie Andrews
Darling! Mmm!
Hello, darling. Mmm.
Hello, darling.
Hope you don't mind me bringing Stanley along.
Oh, he's always welcome.
Would you like a drink, Stanley?
Please.
I'll do that. You sit down.
You've been coping with the kids all day.
Go on. Have a good sit-down. Relax.
What are you going to have? Your usual?
Yes, dear.
Right.
You know that, um... that book I was reading?
The Spinoza Reassessment?
Yes.
I was thinking Stanley should have a look at that. Fascinating.
Absolutely fascinating.
Here we are. Old Mr. Wine will soon set you on your feet again.
What for you, Stanley?
Oh, I'll have the same as Margaret.
Same as Margaret. Wine.
I bet you thought I'd forgotten what day it was.
How awful of me. I forgot.
Don't be silly.
You've got so much on your mind.
Who cares about a silly old anniversary?
What matters is we love each other.
Do you know, Stanley, we've been married seven years? It's our wooden wedding.
Incredible.
I got a little something for you.
Oh!
From my heart.
Darling. Oh.
Here's to our marriage.
Here's to all of us.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
I'll go and get that book.
I forgot our wedding anniversary.
Don't be upset.
I feel so dreadful!
Oh, darling...
Here we are.
See what you make of it.
We can discuss it at next week's tutorial. Fine.
I must get on with the cooking.
Don't you do a thing.
You sit down, relax and enjoy your drink.
I'll do the supper tonight.
I feel a bit of an intruder, your anniversary and everything.
You're not an intruder.
You're very welcome. Isn't he, Margaret?
Well, I ought to be off anyway.
I want to catch the Giotto exhibition.
What time's the next bus to Oxford?
Are you going to that?
I've got a great idea.
Margaret, why don't you drive Stanley?
You can see it together.
- You've been longing to see that.
It's the last day.
- I can't.
- There's the supper, the kids to put to bed.
- I'll do all that.
It'll be your present to me. Really.
You are sweet, darling.
- Go on. Enjoy yourself and come back for supper.
- Are you sure?
Absolutely positive.
Hello, darlings!
Up into Daddy's arms.
Bye-bye.
Say bye-bye to Mommy. Bye-bye.
Look after Daddy, darlings.
Look after Margaret, Stanley.
I will. Have a good time.
Blow a kiss to Mommy.
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!
Do you think he knows?
It would never occur to him.
Oh.
He's such a marvelous man.
The way he brings philosophy to life.
Oh, he couldn't be a better husband or father.
Or teacher. He's a saint.
He's the only man I know... who actually lives up to his ideals.
He's such an example to us all.
The children worship him.
He's more of a god than a human being.
If only he weren't so good.
If only he had one tiny flaw.
We must stop thinking about him... and think more of ourselves!
But it would kill him if he knew.
I feel as if I'm being torn apart.
My darling.
My precious darling.
We c... We can't...
We can't keep on denying ourselves.
All these years we've been married... he's never said a cross word.
When I was ill... he came to my room... and he gave me some soup... he made!
Oh, Stanley!
How can we do this to him?
I love you.
And I love you.
It... It can't hurt him if he doesn't know.
I... I want... I want...
I want to give you my love... in the best, most... most beautiful way.
Oh. Oh.
Ow!
What? What is it?
It's his pipe. His favorite pipe.
But, Margaret, don't be upset, please.
And we were going to...
On his favorite pipe!
The whole thing's impossible!
No, Margaret!
Go. Just go!
We must never see each other again, for his sake.
Margaret, please.
Please, Margaret! Oh!
Margaret, please!
Margaret, I beg of you!
Wh...
Ohh.
Hello, Stanley.
Hold this.
Whatever you say, George.
You sound down in the dumps.
Why not?
You painted a beautiful dream and shoved me into a nightmare.
You should never believe the ads.
Shine the light up a bit.
What are you doing now?
Just putting a tiny little ventilation hole in this oil tanker.
Up we go.
That Nicholas was so sickening... with all his blasted sweetness and... ugh!
I know what you mean, Stanley.
Most of the saints throughout history have been a pain in the neck.
Give me a hand with these bottles, would you?
I'm due down in Fleet Street.
You can't stop, can you, eh?
As a matter of fact, I will very soon.
My job's almost done.
What do you mean?
I was up in heaven a few thousand years ago, having a summit conference with God.
I was putting forward a few new proposals.
You go up there every now and again?
Yes.
We were having a giggle about Job actually.
That poor bloke you gave all the boils to and burnt his home and destroyed his family?
That's right. God thought it would be a good idea if I tested Job's faith... with a few diseases and disasters.
You didn't win, though, did you, eh?
In spite of all you did to him, he still believed that God was good.
Well, Job was what you'd technically describe as a loony.
But as I pointed out to God at the time... for every job or soul that he lands, I get two.
I was two billion ahead already.
You make it sound like a blooming game.
That's precisely what it is... and the first one to reach a hundred billion souls is the winner.
He doesn't stand a chance actually.
I've only got six to go.
What happens when you get them?
Oh, when I've won... when I've won... the world will be in such a rotten, stinking mess... that it can get on without me.
I'll go back to heaven, sit on God's right hand and be his favorite angel again.
It must be very nice for you to go back to heaven, but... what will happen to me?
Don't worry, Stanley.
Your future's assured.
Um, George...
I don't want to go on with the rest of my wishes.
I can't find happiness like this.
You're always too clever for me.
So, um, I'll be running along... and, uh, I'll see you sometime, eh?
Stanley, I can't let you go in this mood.
Let's cancel my appointment.
I'm ahead of schedule, in any case.
No, I can't interrupt your work.
What are friends for?
I'll round up Avarice and Gluttony, two lovely girls. The afternoon's on me.
Whee!
Oh, eat up, Stanley!
Come on, Stanley. Stick one in
Jane Russell and win a goldfish.
No.
You have a go, Gluttony.
Chuck 'em. Don't eat 'em.
This is how Garibaldi lost his life.
Enjoying yourself, Stanley?
You know I can't stand heights, George.
Up, up, up, up!
Having fun, Stanley?
Bang!
Another 10 shillings gone.
Don't worry about that, Avarice.
Whee!
Enjoying yourself, Stanley?
That's three pounds-seven and nine pence without Gluttony's sweets.
George, take me out of here, will you?
Enough, George, is enough.
We didn't need to take a taxi.
Nothing's too much for my friend Stanley.
Thank you very much for this afternoon, George, but, um...
I don't think it's really helped, you know.
I still don't want to go on with it.
But you were so nearly there.
She loved you, you loved her.
You just left me one little loophole.
I had to take advantage of it.
Doctor's orders.
Next time you must specify, really spell things out in detail.
I can't think straight anymore.
Take your time.
Have another lie-down in my room.
Yeah, and then you put Lust in the bed just to confuse me.
I promise you, Lust won't be there.
Hello.
Oh, excuse me. I thought this was Mr. Spiggott's bedroom.
How right you were. It is.
Oh. Well, he must have made a mistake.
He said I could use it.
Oh, you're his new little favorite, are you?
I'm Stanley Moon. Who are you?
They call me Envy.
Not a very attractive name, is it?
I always wanted to be called Vanity.
Never mind. I'm stuck with it.
How is Mr. Spiggott these days?
Quite well.
He may be leaving soon.
Charming.
I'm always the last to be told.
It's funny how he's always too busy for me... but he's never too busy for Lust, ducky.
He's at her beck and bloody call.
Look, what are you doing in George's bedroom?
Oh, it's "George," is it?
Good friends, I suppose.
If you want to know why I'm in his bedroom, go and take a look at mine.
What's wrong with it?
What's right with it?
For a start, it's half the size of all the others.
Wallpaper's peeling off, and it's miles from the nearest convenience.
Of course, Lust and Gluttony are right next door to the bathroom.
Nothing's too good for them.
Well, I suppose Lust and Gluttony... really have to be rather near the bathroom.
You're on the seven-wishes bit, aren't you, dear?
Yeah, but it doesn't seem to be doing me much good.
Although George said if I really specified the personality, I'd be all right.
Don't you believe it, cherub.
He may think he's the cat's whiskers... but there's one person who can run rings round him.
Who do you mean?
God?
Old creepy drawers can't hold a candle to him.
I think you've got me this time, Stanley.
Let me get it quite clear.
I want to be a warm, loving, tender person... and Margaret exactly the same.
I want all the fun of meeting her for the first time and falling in love with her.
I love her, and she loves me.
We're in love forever.
Surroundings?
Serene and far removed... from the false glitter... the raucous music and the neon lights of this modern world.
We're both young, white and in perfect health.
Stanley, I've gotta hand it to you.
That's real specifying.
You've come up with the one formula that I, as the devil, really dread... mutual love and spiritual values.
I want peace and quiet... and... and no other men in her life.
Julie Andrews.
Shh!
Welcome to the Berelian
Order, Sister Luna.
Until you are initiated, you will wear the habit of a novice.
We must speak no more.
The order of the Leaping
Berelians is new...
and nondenominational.
Our patron, Beryl of Sussex, was a simple shepherdess.
One afternoon she saw a vision in the sky which beckoned her.
Dropping her crook, she leapt towards the vision...
which, ever receding and ever beckoning, urged her upwards...
until she disappeared into the clouds.
This miracle was witnessed by a two-year-old child...
who ran to the spot and picked up Beryl's shoes that had fallen to the Earth.
That child founded this order...
whose Sisters have taken a vow of silence...
until such time as Beryl of Sussex is canonized...
and recognized by the people of the world for her tremendous feat.
What is this feeling that overwhelms me?
It is something new and strange.
It is love, oh, my most cherished.
I see it in your eyes.
This is love profane. Must be sin in me that so confounds my senses.
There is no sin in love, my darling.
And I love you for all eternity.
Margaret.
You know my name.
What magic is afoot?
Our love is written in the book of fate. There is no escaping it.
This can't be right... and yet, within my breast beats such desire.
Don't be afraid. Just trust in me.
Allow your heart to speak.
You must go through with the initiation ceremony to show your faith.
But I'm afraid of heights.
Show your courage in your leaping.
I didn't go to vespers.
I had to see if you were all right.
Oh, Margaret, my precious.
At last we're alone. We can speak.
But only this once.
Whatever it is that draws us together we must cast out.
It is unnatural and wrong.
How can it be wrong if we love each other?
It is wrong... and I'm so ashamed to break my vow.
I came here to find peace and quiet... and faith.
And have you found it?
Not yet.
However hard I try...
I can't believe that God exists.
But he does exist.
I know that for certain.
How can you be so sure?
Because I've met the devil.
The devil?
Yeah.
Let me tell you what happened to me.
I used to be a man.
My name was Stanley Moon, and I was a short order cook.
I was very much in love with you, but I was too shy to tell you.
I've never seen you before today.
I got so miserable that
I tried to kill myself.
And then George came along and offered me seven wishes for my soul.
Who's George?
Well, he's the devil.
We're very good friends. He's not so bad when you understand his problems.
That's why I keep going...
'Cause I usually disappear when I go...
I find that as hard to believe as all that about Beryl and her leap.
But it's true, and I've got one wish to go.
I can't think what's happened to George. Look.
You see? Nothing.
I just hope it's not too late.
I love you, Margaret.
And I love you, Sister Luna.
And my love will last forever.
But it can never be... fulfilled.
I must find George before he goes to heaven.
Good evening, Sister.
We gave already!
Let me in! Let me in!
Take that, you great git!
Huh. Sorry, Father.
Can I be of any help? Oh!
Wake up, George!
George, wake up.
Thank goodness you're still here.
I was just having a bit of a nap before the party.
I've done it.
I've got me hundred billion.
Oh, congratulations.
Look, what went wrong?
I blew my raspberry hundreds of times, and nothing happened.
I still got one more wish to go, you know.
How'd you figure that out?
I was the intellectual, I was Sir
Stanley Moon, the businessman...
I was the fly, the pop singer, the student, and this one makes six.
What about the Frobisher and Gleason raspberry-flavored ice lolly?
- That didn't count!
- Of course it did.
It was a wish, wasn't it?
That reminds me.
I owe you sixpence.
Here we are. Now we're even.
Then I'm stuck as a woman?
As a nun.
You should have specified the sex.
You've won, haven't you, George? Well, if
I can't have Margaret, I'll kill myself.
Sorry, Stanley. It's out of the question.
Whatever you are on your last wish you remain forever.
Isn't this a terrific party?
Terrific for some, ducky.
Look at the lousy table I've got.
Come on, sweetie. Let's dance.
No, thank you.
You're going now, George?
Yes, Stanley.
I thought I'd just sneak away quietly.
I don't want to spoil the party.
Well, um, I hope you get back in... you know, upstairs.
Thank you very much.
Apart from Margaret, you're the only person I've ever enjoyed talking to.
Now you're going, and, well, I can't talk to her.
Um, I'll rather miss you.
I'll miss you too, Stanley.
You know, looking around the party at everybody... all of them trying to be something they weren't in the first place... all I want to be is me, what
I was before I met you.
But that's impossible.
You can't be that without your soul.
Being me didn't seem like very much at the time.
Well, it wasn't very much, but it's a good deal better than the alternatives.
I'd give... anything to be myself again.
But I don't have anything to give, really, do I?
Look, I'll tell you what, Stanley.
I've got me hundred billion souls and a few to spare.
I don't really need yours. It's not much of a catch. I can give it to you back again.
Is it possible?
It's never been done before.
It's a very magnanimous gesture.
In fact, it's a glorious gesture.
Part of my new image. Here we are.
I knew you weren't all bad.
Of course not. I've just been thoroughly misunderstood.
Now, then take this, burn it up, and when it's all gone... you'll be Stanley Moon again... short order chef,
Caucasian, 28, male.
And what about Margaret?
She'll be at Wimpy's as usual.
Nobody will know that any of this has ever happened.
You're an angel, George.
Here's hoping.
Do me a favor, Stanley. Look after the party for me. See everybody has a good time.
When that's done, it's over to you.
I'll do my best.
Bye, George.
Bye, Stanley.
Hello, my good man. Are you Saint Peter?
Yes.
I'd like to see God, please.
Who shall I say is calling?
Oh, come on. You know me.
Beelzebub, Lucifer,
Prince of Darkness.
Have you an appointment?
He's always got time for me.
I'll just see if he's...
Don't say you'll just see if he's in.
Of course he's in.
Blimey, how did you get this job?
Would you wait here, sir?
Hurry up then!
If I were you wanting to get in,
I should try being a bit more humble.
Oh, would you really? Yes.
I dare say you would.
You're quite right, of course.
I'll throw a bit of filth over meself.
That should please him.
He'll see you now.
Oh, thank you very much.
Hello!
God!
It's me.
Where are you?
I wish you'd manifest yourself a bit.
It's so hard just talking to thin air.
On thy belly shalt thou go!
Oh, blimey. You're not still on about that, are you?
All right.
Dust shalt thou eat!
Oh, naturally, yes.
Dust, of course. What else?
Mmm. Delicious. This is very good. Num, num, num.
Speak!
It's a bit difficult with all this dust in me mouth... but I've come about readmission.
You know, I'm ready to come back in again and join you.
Hast thou, in thy purpose, swayed or wavered?
Swayed or wavered?
Just take a look at the world.
It's never been in such a mess.
I've done a wonderful job.
People are killing each other, lusting after each other's wives... worshipping false idols.
I've done a marvelous job. It's never been so sinful, miserable and perverted.
You should be very happy.
Oh, don't go forming yourself into a whirlwind... just 'cause I got to a hundred billion souls first.
Somebody's got to lose. Oh, I'll tell you something that'll really please you.
I've done a good deed. I gave that little twit his soul back.
Wasn't that generous?
Made me feel marvelous!
Well, come on. Am I in?
Hello. Where are you?
This way, please.
What's happening?
One moment he was talking to me, the next moment he was gone.
I'm afraid you failed the entrance examination.
I can't have failed. I've done everything he asked of me.
And to show how repentant I was,
I even did a good deed.
Made me feel marvelous, just like I was in the old days.
There you are. It sounds as if you made a good gesture for the wrong motives.
What do you mean, "wrong motives"?
For your own joy, to make you feel better than someone else.
Oh. Well, I can fix that.
I'll get Stanley to give me his soul back, then return it for the right reasons.
I won't be proud. Tell God not to go away.
I'll be back in a minute.
Stanley! Hold everything!
Stanley! Stanley!
Where are you?
It's me, George, your old friend.
I want your soul back just for a second.
Then I'll give it to you back in a better way. I promise you. Where are you?
Stanley!
Are you in there? It's not a trick.
Stanley!
Stanley, wait!
Stanley!
I'm gonna do it.
This time I'm...
I'm going to do it.
I've got to do it.
I-I know I can and I know I will.
Here... Here I go. Now!
Miss Spencer!
What is it, Stanley?
I wonder if you'd like to come and have dinner with me tonight.
Sorry. I'm already doing something.
Another night perhaps.
Stanley. Stanley.
She could make it tonight. I could fix it.
Tonight and every night.
I've got a new deal for you.
No, thanks, George.
I'd like to try it my way.
What a triumph.
Very funny.
All right, you great git.
You've asked for it.
I'll cover the world in
Tastee-Freez and Wimpy Burgers.
I'll fill it full of concrete runways, motorways... aircraft, television and automobiles... advertising, plastic flowers and frozen food... supersonic bangs.
I'll make it so noisy and disgusting... that even you'll be ashamed of yourself.
No wonder you've so few friends.
You're unbelievable.
Thank you.
Tonight, we celebrate with dancing and wine.
Then I'll ready my boat.
And between breakfast and readying your boat...
...I want you to kill everyone on Blefuscu.
But Lilliput is safe.
- I said, kill them!
- We've won. Isn't that enough?
Then force them to open their eggs at the little end.
No, I will not degrade anyone.
We don't need vengeance.
I need it!
On to the banquet.
How dare that man disobey you!
He didn't disobey.
His Majesty didn't insist.
I never had to insist before.
It's unheard of.
- Disgraceful.
- Humiliating.
I'm never humiliated.
But it was disgraceful.
- He won the war.
- He shamed the army and navy.
What's war without death?
Where's the sacrifice beyond the call of duty? The heroism?
I move the prime minister suggest a way...
...to dispose of this freak.
Well, Reldresal?
If we kill him, there would be a danger of an epidemic.
- The navy could float him out to sea.
- Too big. Cost too much.
I have it!
We'll send him to Blefuscu and have them kill him.
Superb idea, Your Majesty.
That way, he's their problem.
It may not be nice, but it's legal.
What if they decide to use him against us?
Shame! Shame! Shame!
How can you plot against Gulliver?
Now, dear, don't get excited.
Nobody's plotting.
You can't fool me. Criers are out proclaiming your kindness.
That means someone will be executed.
- Gulliver wouldn't do my bidding!
- That's no excuse for killing him!
Listen.
Such a sweet, gentle song...
...for such a big, powerful man.
- But I sing, and much better.
- Be quiet!
If he'd made a fool of you, you wouldn't be swaying like a maiden.
- You'd be spitting nails at him.
- Such vanity. Such vanity!
Nothing he does can offend me.
Fire!
Put out the fire!
Stay where you are. I'll put it out.
The uncouth, vile, filthy, evil, dirty spitting and spewing animal.
As I said, madam. As I said.
Destroy him. He's ruined my dress.
Destroy him!
- Precisely the way we all feel.
- Execute him.
Brilliant!
You're a man of action, Flimnap.
You're accused of treason. Flee!
- The emperor's mad.
- Executioners are coming.
Treason? But I saved Lilliput.
I was even decorated.
You made Galbet jealous. The admiral hates you for scuttling the fleet.
The empress is furious.
You ruined her dignity and her dress.
I stop wars, put out fires, feed people...
...give them hope, peace and prosperity. How can I be a traitor?
Treason, man, treason.
The emperor hates you because you're more important than he is.
Petty ambition, selfish people.
Go to freedom and eggs the way you want them.
- I never eat eggs.
- Neither do I. It's the principle.
You caused trouble, endangered your daughter, to win a point?
You promised the giant would solve our problems.
He will. You're the biggest.
Make everyone open eggs your way.
No one's big enough to stop your bickering.
It poisons everything.
Make them think like you.
That will end bickering and war.
Don't you see?
Then I'd be just like the emperor.
And so would you.
Using my strength to oppress others.
- Treason!
- False pride and vanity.
They destroy everything for lovers.
Elizabeth was right.
The only safety is in being obscure, in being nothing.
- Down with force and power.
- Kill him!
Call the guards!
Please, I need your help.
Halt!
- I must show this to the king.
- See the king's chamberlain.
- Welcome to Brobdingnag.
- Don't be frightened. You're safe.
Is that his name? Gulliver?
Yes, my dear. He belongs to Elizabeth.
She's told us all about him.
Now they're the prized possessions of your king.
I know how highly you value these little people, but I must warn you.
Little people are shrunken people, and shrunken people are dangerous.
Makovan, shrunken people are little and little people are toys.
And no one in the entire land of Brobdingnag has them except me.
Take your Gulliver inside.
He needs food and rest.
And the court tailor will make him new clothes.
You're going to be very rich, my girl.
Very rich.
- What did you say your name was, dear?
- Glumdalclitch.
There you are. That will keep your family happy for years.
I don't wanna sell him.
I brought him because law says:
" Little people should be brought to the palace at once."
That's quite right.
Only the king can own little people.
But he's mine. I found him.
My dear child, I've got a surprise for you. Come along with me.
What do you think of these?
My collection of the tiniest animals in the world.
- They're very nice.
- Nice?
It's the most unusual collection ever.
Come see my favourite.
See this tiny crocodile?
He's the fiercest fighting flesh of his size in captivity. Watch.
See how he snaps at it?
That's why we keep him alone.
He'd kill the others instantly.
Now, as a reward...
...l'll give you any of these animals, except my crocodile.
I don't want any. I want my Gulliver.
Come now, girl. Don't be stubborn.
Your king knows best.
He's a king for grownups. Children don't have a king to protect them.
I'm everybody's king.
You take things from children, like all grownups.
They never ask. They just take.
Why not let her stay here? She'll be an excellent guardian for them.
All right. Then I'll decree...
...that your parents let you live here. See? I'm your king too.
Thank you.
I'll protect them with my life!
I'll show you your room, and we'll get you a lovely new dress.
Pages, bring the castle.
You never saw anything of Pritchard or the crew?
After the Antelope sank,
I washed ashore here.
Let's hope that they were saved too.
I never stopped believing you were alive. Not for a moment.
When I think of what those little people might have done to you!
They were vain and selfish.
You're so right.
Wanting to be important and powerful is meaningless.
Our being together is all the importance we ever needed.
- Wait!
- Are you all right?
It's Glumdalclitch, the little girl who found you.
- How do you do? And thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'm going to sleep now, but if you want anything, just call.
Good night, dear.
Isn't this a beautiful place?
And no mortgage, either.
It's a paradise compared to Wapping.
I don't care where we are as long as we're together and safe.
- You got your strength back fast.
- Giant food agrees with me.
No, don't. We're not married yet.
Elizabeth, open the door.
Elizabeth!
Glumdalclitch, wake up!
- Wake the king. We want to be married.
- Now? But everyone's asleep.
Fetch the king, please.
All right. Stop shouting.
Grownups are silly. And little grownups are sillier than anybody.
Wake up in there! Wake up!
Why arouse everyone?
They want a simple ceremony.
If I have to be up in the middle of the night, so does everybody.
- You forgot your slippers.
- I want to do this and go to sleep.
Don't be so grumpy, dear.
Remember carrying me off by moonlight?
How impetuous you were!
How the fires of passion stirred you!
I wish they'd stir now.
It's cold in these halls.
- Please, Your Majesty.
- Yes, all right.
- Where are they?
- There, King Brob.
Pages, get the fire going.
These stones are cold.
They'll be a delightful couple.
Charming!
Forgive me for disturbing you.
Quite all right.
You sure you know what you're doing?
None of your jokes.
You're making them nervous.
They're supposed to be nervous.
Where's the licence?
Where'd they go, the little lovers?
For shame! Shame on all of you!
Stop this nonsense.
Marry them at once.
You're right, dear.
I'd better marry them at once.
I pronounce you man and wife by the authority vested in me, by me.
Live happily, long life, lots of children, that sort of thing.
He should kiss the bride.
He is, dear.
And now, can we go back to bed?
Wake up. Wake up, sleepyheads.
It's morning.
"On our honeymoon. Be back soon.
Love, Elizabeth and Lemuel Gulliver."
Oh, dear. No!
Darling, if we're gone too long,
Glumdalclitch might get into trouble.
She's a big girl. A very big girl.
She can take care of herself.
No more cares. No more worries.
Not a one. I only have to keep you happy, and I'll work hard to do it.
Work? What for?
- To get money to buy food.
- We get all our food free.
- Then, to pay taxes, at least.
- But there are no taxes on us.
- Then to save money for our family.
- The king will give us money.
Yes, but... I guess so.
I don't have a thing to worry about for the rest of my life.
Gulliver? Elizabeth?
Where are you? Answer me!
Elizabeth, here I am!
Down here!
Glumdalclitch, hurry. Over here.
- There you are. Where's Gulliver?
- Here I am!
Down here.
Down here!
- Don't run away again.
- Thank you for saving me.
- Why did you run away?
- We didn't run away.
When you're grown up... become an adult, you'll understand.
- You could have been killed.
- We won't do it again.
I love you both, but you must do what I say.
You must behave, or the king won't let me stay with you.
I have to take you back right now.
The queen is terribly worried.
You upset the queen.
- You cannot leave without permission.
- Where did you go?
On our honeymoon. Your country is as beautiful as England.
- We won't go out alone again.
- Sensible. She will take care of you.
- I can take care of Elizabeth.
- Good! I like little men with spunk.
There. Let's see the alchemist find a formula to get him out of that.
A clever move, sire.
He'll take your rook if you move there.
- I beg your pardon?
- I shouldn't have interfered.
You play chess?
- Quite often.
- He's very good.
Let's see how good he is.
Take over Makovan's game.
- May I study the board?
- Of course.
I'm ready, Your Majesty.
That's a strange move.
Really? I'd like to know more about him.
- What were you in your little country?
- I was a doctor.
A witchery doctor.
No, Makovan. A bodily doctor.
Baying at the moon or waving a cat won't cure a bladder ailment.
Stop that jabbering. It's my move.
Ridiculous. Impossible.
I can take your...
No, then you could take my...
This isn't a judging game.
You'd better let him win.
You win.
He can't help it if he's a bright man.
It isn't like you to be a bad loser.
He didn't lose. A witch tricked him into making false moves.
But I couldn't have been beaten by such a tiny witch.
Maybe he wasn't always small.
A witch can make himself any size he wants.
Have you seen the way he kisses that woman of his?
Witches aren't interested in that sort of thing.
Precisely.
Do married people kiss so happily?
Always, all the time?
You have a point there, Makovan.
My stomach!
Oh, it hurts!
Makovan, get me some herbs quickly.
They're angry with us.
Teatime's past, and they always invited me.
Is that the price? Loss of dignity?
- Losing the game isn't losing dignity.
- It's pretending to be stupid.
- You could try to humour them.
- I could educate them.
They're backward, they're in the Middle Ages.
Don't change them. That'd spoil everything. We're happy here.
- We can't be when we're nobodies.
- Try to be equal, they'll hate us.
If I don't, they'll laugh.
They laugh enough, they'll get bored.
Then they'll stop laughing.
Since that's all we're here for, they'll get rid of us.
- The queen is ill.
- When? We just left her.
I saw them carry her to her quarters.
- Who's caring for her?
- Makovan.
- She needs a doctor.
- No, please.
- She's healthy. She just eats too much.
- Please wait!
Take me to Makovan's laboratory.
I can't do that. The king won't allow it. It's forbidden.
Do as I say!
It's an evil place filled with Makovan's magic.
- I'll turn his magic into medicine.
- No! You'll be killed.
Don't worry. It's our best chance to live happily ever after forever.
Take me there.
This will soothe you. My special formula made of spirits of theriac.
- It's too hot, you fool!
- It must be hot, Your Majesty.
It's not helping her, Makovan.
Try another formula.
King Brob? Please, King Brob.
Let Dr. Gulliver help her.
What are you doing here?
Go away, child.
Just relax. I'm a physician, a doctor. I'll help you.
I'm dying.
You're not dying.
You merely have an upset stomach.
But it aches so.
I have prepared a solution of laudanum, a paregoric.
- Drink it and you'll feel better.
- Are you sure?
I know it will cure you.
I'm staking my life on it.
As a physician, I wish I could take madam's hand and soothe her.
Yes, doctor.
The medicine is on the table.
Drink it down like a good girl.
Yes, doctor.
She's calling for him.
She's losing her mind.
No, he's going to help her.
He's a doctor.
Help her? That little witch?
Where is he?
- Put it down! No, no!
- Away.
- All of it, madam!
- Yes, doctor.
He's poisoned her.
She needed help on the inside, not the outside.
There he is!
Catch him!
Stop it!
I feel better already.
- Are you sure?
- The pain's completely gone.
You gave me the scare of my life.
All of you leave.
I wish to consult with Gulliver.
You may leave too, dear.
Gulliver will be safe here with me.
I said I'd like a few minutes alone with my physician.
- Your what?
- My doctor.
Dr. Gulliver.
I can care for you.
Get rid of that man.
You didn't save my life. He did.
- I'm your husband.
- I want my doctor.
All right then. I'll take my doctor.
Dr. Makovan, come with me.
I told you he was a witch, sire.
Shall I burn him?
It's not fair to burn a witch without proving it.
Do you want me to burn him, then prove him a witch?
Or shall I prove it, then burn him?
I don't want the queen upset.
That's what I want.
Then I shall prove him first, and then burn him later.
Is that what you wish?
Must I always tell you what to do?
Show a little initiative.
- Can I watch you make him a witch?
- I'm not making him a witch.
- Can I watch you make him a witch?
- I'm not making him a witch.
He is one, I'll just prove it.
Can I watch? Are you going to burn him afterward?
Witches are always burned at midnight, after your bedtime.
- I was told to bring Gulliver.
- Yes. Just put him on the table.
Not with that cat here.
I'd better keep him in my basket.
The thing's a doll!
- You sent for me? Can I be of service?
- Perhaps.
This is my daughter, Shrike.
Darling, this is Glumdalclitch, guardian of this...
He's not a doll! He's my little man.
I'm not big enough to be your father, but I'm old enough.
He's silly looking and squeaks like a mouse.
You're jealous because you don't have one.
Now, girls. You both go outside and play.
King Brob told me never to leave Gulliver.
Out, I said. There'll be honey cakes and milk for you later.
It's all right. We have grownup scientific matters to discuss.
- What substance is that?
- Air, water, fire and earth.
Plus the spirits of alchemy?
- Mercury, sulphur, arsenic.
- You know those?
- Chemists know our debt to magicians.
- You know magic?
They called it magic when trying to change iron into gold.
- We call it chemistry now.
- You know how to make gold from iron?
It's easier to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.
You can do that?
How did you know?
Stop that! Girls!
Stop that. Stop that, I say!
Easy. Daddy loves his little baby.
There, there.
He'll put you in the tanks! You'll turn blue! Lt'll prove you're a witch.
- He'll kill you.
- Don't worry. I can handle it.
Everyone he says is a witch, they turn blue in those magic waters.
What did you do?
You're not a witch, are you?
No, Glumdalclitch.
There, there, my sweet.
Leave her alone, you bully.
Sit here and watch me turn him blue.
Then can I stay up late and see the fire?
Turn blue? An innocent man?
A shrivelled man who beats the king at chess...
...cures the queen and makes a silk purse from a sow's ear must turn blue.
Climb down into that pan.
That's enough.
Get in the next one.
- Climb out, Gulliver.
- Yes, sir.
He didn't turn blue!
- Incredible!
- Merely a chemical reaction.
This contains lichen, which eats algae.
Anyone stepping into lichen and then into an alkaline, must turn blue.
- But you're red.
- Of course.
I changed the alkaline to acid.
Acid will then turn anything red.
Amazing witchery.
It's still colourless.
It's the same as your experiment.
It will turn you red.
Never!
Gulliver, the cat!
My cat! You've turned her red.
There, there, my sweet.
Daddy didn't do it, the witch did it.
Your hair will turn red!
Sure as science, and I'm not a witch.
It's turning!
It is, Daddy. It's red.
Your hair.
Little witch, you'll make a short but colourful flame.
Where does he get such power? To turn my hair red, to cure the queen?
Where does he get such power? To turn my hair red, to cure the queen?
I say destroy the witch, sire, before he destroys us.
- It wasn't magic!
- He's not a witch!
Invisible spirits. Evil spirits.
You turned Makovan's hair red.
- Only because I know chemistry.
- There's no such thing, or I'd know.
- No one knows it all.
- What he doesn't know, doesn't exist!
Brobdingnaggians are the wisest people in the world.
And I'm their king, understand?
Admit you never beat me at chess.
By fair means, I mean.
If I deny what I know, what I see and what I hear...
...then I deny all knowledge.
- And if the queen gets another ache?
- That has nothing to do with this!
Get that through your little thick head!
Deny anything they want, say anything! Save yourself.
I can't live without you.
Open the cage.
I'm ready to confess everything.
Confess, then.
I confess that the sun goes round the Earth.
I confess that the world is flat.
I confess that there is no such thing as...
...medicine or science.
And it would take a witch to beat me at chess.
It would take a witch.
Now he's more guilty than ever.
There was no medicine, so he cured the queen with nothing.
Only a witch could do that.
We must burn him.
I'm afraid we must. I'm sorry.
You promised I would be spared.
You lied!
You wear an ignorant's fear.
What you don't know, you destroy.
- Burn him!
- No!
Wait. I have a better way to destroy a witch.
Remarkable idea, sire.
There won't even be an ash remaining.
Go back to bed, child.
She must be spared.
She's done nothing.
- They are both alike.
- On with it!
Leave her there for now.
Open the door of the cage.
Dr. Gulliver! Take this!
- That's it! That's it!
- Come on!
Kill him! Get him, get him!
Hit him again!
- Kill him!
- Finish it!
Come on, kill him!
Come on, get him!
See what powers he has? The strength of a dozen his size. Burn him.
Gulliver! Elizabeth!
- After them!
- Come on!
- Don't let them get away!
- Stop them!
They're coming.
Where shall I hide you?
You can't stay here.
Animals will eat you.
You can't do anymore. Save yourself!
Where are they?
Where did you hide them?
I don't know!
Leave the child alone.
They're somewhere here. Find them.
They must be somewhere here.
- We can't let them escape.
- Set light to the brush!
We're going to die here.
If only I'd listened to you!
If only I hadn't tried to make you live my way.
If only I hadn't wanted everything my way.
There, at the stream.
Hurry! Into the basket.
Where are we?
I don't know.
Was it a dream?
As real as anything we think.
But the giants.
What if the giants come back?
They're always with us, the giants and the Lilliputians.
Inside us.
Their terrible world waiting to take our lives...
...waiting for us to make a mistake.
To be selfish again.
How can we bear it?
How can we live with such fear?
With love.
The way Glumdalclitch did.
Glumdalclitch. What happened to her?
She's waiting to be born.
Yes.
We're back in our world!
Pardon me. We're lost.
Perhaps you've heard of our country from a soldier or sailor.
- We come from far-off England.
- A town called Wapping.
Are you barmy? This is England.
And Wapping's just beyond that wood.
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

THE LEOPARD
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord be with thee...
What is that disturbance?
What has happened?
Excuse me, Your Excellency.
A dead soldier has been found in the garden.
What?
There's rioting in the city, everywhere.
This letter has arrived.
It's urgent. From the Duke of Malvica.
"Dear Fabrizio, read the terrible news in the paper."
"The Piedmontese have landed.
We are lost."
"My family and I are taking refuge in the English ships anchored here."
"I'm sure you'll do likewise."
"God save our beloved king."
The coward!
"An act of piracy was committed on 11th May..."
...when armed men landed at Marsala."
"Reports say there were about 800, led by Garibaldi."
"The brigands carefully avoided any clash with royalist troops..."
"...and made for Castelvetrano..."
"...threatening peaceful inhabitants and causing pillage and devastation."
Paolo, you'll go to the house in Palermo.
Empty houses are lost houses.
No, please, Fabrizio. It's dangerous.
This is war.
Francesco Paolo, call Mimi.
It's the revolution.
Drink this, you'll feel better.
He's just coming, father.
Pardon, Excellency.
In the garden we've found...
Mimi, tell Don Antonio to harness the horses to the carriage.
I'll go to Palermo after our meal.
Father Pirrone...
...you'll accompany me, won't you?
May the Lord protect us.
But with the streets full of soldiers, bandits...
You'll spend two hours with your colleagues.
We'll return at eleven.
We eat in half an hour.
All of you.
What are we going to do?
Save us, Queen of Heaven, mother of mercies...
These swines stink even when they're dead.
Salvatore, did you alert the barracks?
Excellency, we've told them to come and remove him.
What terrible times, Excellency.
Look at all the fires on the mountains.
- They're the rebels' camps.
- I see them, Father.
Perhaps Your Excellency is worried about Don Tancredi.
Tancredi should guard against certain friendships...
...certain dangerous acquaintances.
Father, the fault is not Tancredi's.
The fault is the times.
A young nobleman cannot even play cards without making dangerous friends.
That's enough now.
Still, a little prudence...
Halt! Villa Airoldi road-block.
Good evening Your Excellency.
Excuse us.
Let the Prince of Salina through.
What a beautiful country this would be if...
If there weren't so many Jesuits.
I'll come back for you in two hours.
Pray well, Father.
- Where can we go?
- To the tavern, by the port.
Good evening, handsome.
Melina, that's not for you.
Mind your own business.
My big prince.
Good day, uncle.
Tancredi. What were you up to last night?
Nothing at all, uncle.
I was with friends, a virtuous night.
Not like some I know, who went to amuse themselves...
...down in Palermo.
And who would they be?
You yourself, uncle.
I saw you talking to the sergeant at the road-block.
A fine thing, at your age.
And with a reverend father, too.
Such libertines.
Well, after all, it's true.
Why are you dressed like that?
For a masked ball in the morning?
I'm going soon, uncle.
I came to say farewell.
Why? Where are you going?
Not a duel...
Yes. A great duel, uncle, with the king.
I'm going to the mountains, to Ficuzza.
Great things are beginning and
I don't want to stay at home.
They'd seize me here, anyway.
You are mad to join them.
They're mafiosi, all swindlers.
A Falconeri should be with us, for the king.
Certainly, for the king.
But which king? You've said it yourself, uncle.
If King Ferdinando were still alive...
But Franceschiello? No, uncle.
You think the Piedmont man they call
"The Gentleman" will be much better?
A Turin dialect instead of Neapolitan, that's all.
Then what about the republic of
Peppino Mazzini?
If we weren't here, that lot would soon foist the republic on you.
If we want everything to remain as it is, everything has to change.
Have I explained it?
Good-bye, uncle. I'll return with the tricolour.
The tricolour!
You soil your lips with that word.
What is it compared with our golden lily banner?
What do you hope to gain from those colours?
Wait, uncle, you're deluding yourself.
Good-bye, uncle.
I'll see you soon.
Tancredi! Wait!
What are you doing?
Subsidising the revolution now?
Thank you very much, uncle.
Kiss my aunt for me.
Concetta, I'll be back soon.
Has Your Excellency come for confession?
Confession? It's not Saturday.
Excellency, listen to me.
Make confession.
Father, there is no need.
You know everything already.
Confession is not the telling of facts, but the repentance of sins.
I know!
What do you expect of me?
I'm a vigorous man.
Can I be content with a woman who in bed crosses herself before an embrace?
And who afterwards can only say:
"Jesus Mary".
I've had seven children by her...seven.
And, Father, I've never seen her navel.
Is that fair?
Is it, Father? She is the sinner.
I was too brusque.
Do not lose your goodwill towards me.
But listen to me: confess.
I haven't any intention of confessing.
At least, not today.
I've made some important political discoveries.
Do you know what's happening in our country? Nothing.
A barely noticeable substitution of ruling groups.
The middle class doesn't want to destroy us, but to take our place...
...more politely, and even put thousands of ducats into our pockets.
And then the rest can stay as it is.
Father, ours is a country of compromises.
In short, you nobles will come to an agreement with the liberals...
...even with the Masons...
...at our expense. Yes, at the expense of the church...
...because it's clear that all our wealth...
...the patrimony of the poor, will be divided among the insolent ringleaders.
Who then will feed the unhappy people whom the church still supports?
What will be done to placate that desperate horde?
They will be given one piece of your land, then another, finally all of it.
Our Lord healed the physically blind, but what about the mentally blind?
We're not mentally blind, dear Father.
Just human beings in a world of radical change.
What must we do?
The church has been given an explicit promise of immortality.
We, as a social class, have not.
A palliative that promises us another hundred years is the same as eternity.
Beyond what we can caress with our hands we have no obligations.
The church must have obligations, because it is destined not to die.
In its disappearance there might be some solace.
Do you believe, Father, that if one day the church...
...could save itself by sacrificing us it would hesitate to do so?
It wouldn't hesitate, and it would do well.
You'll have two sins to confess to me on Saturday.
A carnal sin last night and a spiritual one today.
Look, Father, how beautiful.
It will take more than King Victor
Emmanuel to change this magic view.
Long live Garibaldi's men!
Help me!
- He's a policeman, a murderer!
- We dealt with him ourselves!
The cavalry!
Hold your fire!
Platoons, forward march!
Hey, nurse, come here!
Where have they gone?
By now they'll be at the port.
What do you say, Father?
Will these glorious new times give us better roads?
Well, the government...
Clear the road!
Nobody can pass. It's blocked.
The road to Bisaquino is closed.
I'm sorry, it's forbidden to pass.
You can't go any further.
Evidently our permit is no good.
I'm not saying that. We've been told all civilian permits are suspended.
If I tell you to turn back, you have to turn back!
Clear the road so the carriages can proceed.
Nobody gets through here!
I'm Captain Prince Tancredi Falconari.
I fought at Palermo with you.
Captain, I have my orders.
This is an order, too. Clear the way!
You live among the nobility.
What do they say about this huge conflagration?
What does our fierce, proud Prince of Salina say?
The nobility, as you call them, aren't easy to understand.
They live in a world apart, not created by God...
...but by themselves, during centuries of very special experiences...
...of troubles and joys - their joys.
They get upset or are fascinated by things that to you and me...
...don't matter at all, but which for them are vital.
I don't mean the nobles are bad, on the contrary.
They're different.
They don't care about certain things which are very important to us...
...and maybe they have fears we're ignorant of.
The Prince of Salina, for example.
He couldn't give up his holiday in
Donnafugata. That's where we're going.
But if you ask him what he thinks, of the revolution...
...he says there's no revolution, everything will go on as before.
That's the last straw.
Let's read the breviary. It's better.
Let's see...
Psalm 45.
My heart overfloweth, I speak of the things I have made touching the king.
My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the children of men.
Grace is poured into thy lips,
God hath blessed thee for ever.
Quickly, lads.
Spread it neatly. You fetch the bottles, and you the glasses.
We hope that everything is just as you want it.
I'm delighted to see you again, Excellency.
Now we'll just rest a little.
You can eat beneath the trees.
We'll leave for Donnafugata in an hour. Tell me about the soldiers...
It's worse than in Algeria.
It's different from Algeria, my dear.
Wouldn't you like to refresh yourself?
Try bathing your temples.
Let's join the others, or we'll find nothing left to eat.
Aren't you hungry?
I told everyone: "His Excellency won't leave Palermo this year."
"How do you expect them to travel in times like these?"
"Who knows what will happen to
His Excellency? May God protect him!"
But you're all safe and sound.
I thank God.
What did you expect to happen to us?
It was all very simple.
In fact, a few days after Garibaldi's entry into Palermo...
...Tancredi brought home a nice Tuscan general...
...who wanted to admire the frescos at the villa...
...and he proved useful in obtaining permits for Donnafugata.
We are most happy to receive you in our home, General.
Thank you, Excellency.
He called you "Excellency".
He's never broken Garibaldi's orders before.
General, my nephew has told me that you would like to see the frescos.
- Very much, Excellency.
- Let's do it at once.
In the centre, Jupiter and Juno,
Mars, Venus and Mercury.
On the other side, Tethys preceded by a group of tritons and dryads.
Apollo surrounded by clouds, and all exalting the house of Salina's glory.
Would you like another mint caramel?
Thank you, they're just the sort I like.
I brought them especially for you.
How pale you are.
Was your wound really not serious?
Pardon?
It's worth being wounded to become promoted on the battlefield.
The carriages are coming!
I am happy to welcome your excellencies.
Don Onofrio! How are we?
Excellency, I hand you back the palace...
...in the exact state in which it was left.
I am proud to shake the hand of the hero wounded fighting at Palermo.
Wounded? They made me a captain because I got a gnat in my eye.
You've done much for the cause,
Don Calogero.
Crispi speaks very highly of you.
Dear Teresina, what a pleasure to see you again.
And you, of course, Don Ciccio.
What news?
News? I haven't any, Excellency.
Will you excuse me now?
Remember to invite them to dinner tonight, with their wives.
- Why the wives?
- It's better.
Invite Don Calogero and tell him to bring his wife.
The lawyer with his wife.
Don Ciccio, who thank God hasn't a wife.
All the others to come after dinner.
- What is it?
- It's Mimi, Excellency.
Father Pirrone asks to see you at once.
All right. Show him in.
I beg your pardon, Excellency.
I didn't know.
Don't be shocked, Father.
You're used to souls being bared.
Bare bodies are much more innocent.
Just give me the towel.
Go on, be brave, Father.
Brisker, Father.
Take my advice: take a bath yourself now and then.
Take a seat, then.
Tell me why you wanted to talk to me so urgently.
I have been entrusted with a very delicate mission.
A person very dear to you wanted to open her heart to me, to tell you...
She has faith, perhaps mistaken, in the esteem with which you honour me.
Can't you be more concise?
Who are you referring to?
The Princess?
No, Excellency. The Princess is very tired and she is resting now.
It concerns signorina Concetta.
She is in love.
Signorina Concetta? But how...
Oh, such foolishness.
I regret having disturbed you.
I did not think...
At forty-five a man may still think he's young...
...until he realizes his children are old enough to fall in love.
Then old age suddenly comes crashing down on him.
You haven't asked me who the young man is, whom Concetta...
There's no need.
Why didn't that stupid girl come to tell me?
Well, in your opinion, what should I say?
The desire to found a Christian family is most welcome to the church.
The presence of Our Lord at the wedding in Cana...
Let us not digress, Father. I intend to speak about this marriage...
...not the wedding in Cana, nor marriage in general.
Has Don Tancredi made a definite proposal? When?
Well, Excellency, not actually a proposal
But Concetta has no doubts.
His attentions, his looks...
...certain words... she is sure he loves her...
...and feels he will propose at any moment.
Don't worry, Father, there's no immediate danger.
These are the fantasies of a romantic schoolgirl.
But why "danger", Excellency?
Can you imagine her as an ambassador's wife in Vienna, or St. Petersburg?
I love Concetta. I like her.
So placid, so submissive.
But Tancredi has a great future before him.
How can Concetta, so passively virtuous, so shy and reserved...
...help an ambitious husband ascend the slippery steps of a new society?
Tancredi will find money useful.
Concetta has her dowry, of course.
But the Salina fortune will have to be divided into seven parts.
I repeat, seven parts.
Tancredi needs something else entirely.
One of the Sutera girls, perhaps?
Yes, I know. They're so ugly, poor things, but so rich.
But what? Love?
Of course, love. Fire and flame for one year, ashes for thirty.
I also know what love is.
Excellency, which clothes will you wear for dinner?
Father, you'll tell Concetta
I'm not at all annoyed...
...but we'll discuss it when we are sure it's not romantic fantasy.
What suit? One for evening wear.
Papa! Don Calogero's coming up the stairs - in tails!
This news has impressed you more than the landing at Marsala.
Don Calogero in white tie.
The sign of the revolution on the march.
Yes, it's true, in tails. But look at them.
And the shoes.
- My wife is unwell. A slight cold.
- I'm very sorry.
I hope you will excuse me if my daughter Angelica comes in her place.
But certainly. Come in.
For a month she's talked of the pleasure it would give her to come.
I remember her well as a very pretty little girl.
We shall be happy to see her again.
She will be here in a moment, she wasn't quite ready.
Our house is just over the road, as you know.
Yes, Don Calogero. We'll wait for her.
As I told you, the church is really in a sorry state.
Lovely.
My Angelica.
I haven't seen you for so long.
You have changed... and not for the worse.
We are very fortunate, signorina Angelica...
...to welcome such a lovely flower into our home.
I hope we shall have the pleasure of seeing you very often.
Thank you, Prince. You are as kind to me as you have always been to Papa.
How do you do, signorina Concetta?
Angelica, as children we were never so formal.
Your Grace, allow me to present my daughter Angelica.
Dinner is served.
Several layers, as tradition demands.
- Was the journey very tiring?
- Not unduly.
They haven't served you yet,
I'm sorry.
- A beautiful daughter.
- Yes, Concetta.
The villa I'm having built outside the village will be modest, but...
...very comfortable.
How hungry we are.
A good thing we didn't start with soup.
Unforgettable days, I tell you.
Only one word of command, from mouth to mouth: arms and soldiers.
The General realized that when
Sicilians get going, they do it well.
Why did you join Garibaldi?
"If Garibaldi is your brother-in-arms he wants only to fight at your side."
Those are his own words. I did not think it would be so strenuous.
I've never walked so much.
Oh, the night march to Gibilrossa...
Did you meet Bixio?
What a determined man.
All of them determined and extraordinary.
The scene between Bixio and La Masa, at which I just happened to be present.
And I was briefly at the taking of Termini.
I enjoyed myself enormously, believe me.
We had the biggest laugh on 28th May.
The General needed a lookout post in the Origlione monastery.
We knocked, we swore - nobody answered the door.
It was a convent for a closed order of nuns.
By the way, Reverend...
...tomorrow we'll pray at the tomb of the reverend mother Corbera.
Excellent. Those good nuns...
...have already been informed to expect your excellencies.
They're in a flurry of preparation for your visit.
We've never missed going there the day after our arrival.
And then? What happened?
I'll tell you.
Tassoni, Aldrighetti and I and someone else...
...tried to break down the door, to no avail.
So we ran to get a beam from a shelled house nearby.
Finally, with an infernal din, the door gave way.
We entered. Everywhere was deserted.
Suddenly we heard desperate twitterings...
...from around the corner of a corridor.
Taking refuge in the chapel, the nuns were piled up against the altar.
Who knows what they feared from those ten fed-up young lads.
It was comic to see them, old and ugly as they were...
...with their black habits, startled eyes, all ready and willing...
...for martyrdom...
...whining like bitches.
Our handsome Tassoni yelled:
"We've no time, sisters. We'll return when you've got us some young novices."
All the boys fell about laughing.
We left the disappointed nuns and went to fire on the king's troops.
Ten minutes later I was wounded.
How I wish I'd been there with you all.
If you'd been there, there would have been no need to wait for novices.
Tancredi. Such crude stories should be told to your confessor.
You do not tell them to young ladies at table.
At least, not when I am present.
He's right, I agree, and I'll help him, too.
But it can't be denied he's a little ignoble.
Oh, the lovely Gigogin.
At fifteen she made love.
Take a step forward, darling of my heart.
At sixteen she got married.
Take a step forward, darling of my heart.
At seventeen I left.
Take a step forward, darling of my heart.
Long live Italy! Long live Garibaldi!
Don't be so sad, Father.
We aren't following a funeral.
The wind... this dreadful wind.
Thank the Lord.
Without wind the air would be fetid.
You must vote in an orderly fashion.
The first to arrive vote first.
The Cavour of Donnafugata.
Excellency, this is a great honour for me.
No. Father Pirrone is not resident here.
Voting is suspended for a few minutes.
May I have the honour...
...of inviting you for modest refreshment?
I think the white will be lighter.
A late homage to the Bourbon flag.
I really cannot drink today.
I have a most aggravating stomach upset.
That's of secondary importance on such a day.
Thank you, I never drink.
Don Calogero, for my part
I accept with pleasure.
I'd like to say a few words...
...but great joys, Prince, are silent.
It is with great emotion that I perform this task.
I have the very great honour...
...to announce the result of the plebiscite of our community.
In the year 1860, 22nd October, in Donnafugata...
...at six p.m...
...the municipal electoral committee met...
...to examine the votes given in the plebiscite...
...by the population of this community.
The Sicilian people want Italy to be one and indivisible...
...with Victor Emmanuel...
...as constitutional monarch, and his legitimate descendants.
All the votes having been taken and due...
All the votes having been taken and due scrutiny made...
...the following results have been obtained.
Electors registered: 515.
Votes cast: 512.
Voting YES: 512.
Voting NO: zero.
And you, Don Ciccio, how did you vote on the 21st?
What are you afraid of?
There's only us, the wind and the dogs.
Excuse me, but your question is pointless.
You know very well everyone in
Donnafugata votes YES.
It's even said that you advised waverers to vote that way.
That's very true.
So you voted YES?
No, Excellency. I voted NO.
No, a hundred times no.
All right, I know what you told me.
For necessity, unity and opportunity.
Perhaps you were right.
I don't understand politics and
I leave these things to others.
But Ciccio Tumeo is a gentleman.
A failed artist, poor and miserable, with worn-out trousers...
...but I hadn't forgotten benefits received, you know that, Excellency.
It was Queen Isabella, the Spanish one...
...who then was Duchess of Calabria - she made me study...
...and allowed me to be where
I am today...
...organist at the Holy Church, paid by the kindness of Your Excellency.
In the years when our need was great, my mother sent an entreaty to Court...
...and financial assistance arrived, as sure as death.
If those kings and queens looked down from heaven, what would they say?
That the son of Leonardo Tomeo betrayed them? No!
No, Excellency.
Thank goodness, the truth is known in paradise.
I admire your loyalty and devotion.
But understand that people are over- excited by this Garibaldi's victory.
The plebiscite was the only and urgent remedy against anarchy. Believe me.
For us it's only a lesser evil.
The Savoyards, basically...
...are a monarchy.
The interests of the people you love, to whom you are devoted...
...emerge from these events thwarted,
I agree...
...but still alive, still valid.
Something had to change...
...so that everything might remain as it was before.
The revolution's work is done.
Let's hope new Italy can live and prosper.
But I voted NO.
The town hall pigs swallowed my opinion and shat it out as they chose.
I said "black" and they've made me say "white".
I was a "loyal subject" and I've become a "foul Bourbon".
Now, they're all Savoyards.
Savoyards! I eat them for breakfast!
Tell me something.
You see so many in the district.
What do you really think of Don Calogero?
I thought I'd shown my opinion clearly enough.
I'd be quite interested to know the truth about him and his family.
The truth, Excellency, is that Don Calogero is very rich...
...and also very influential.
Avaricious, and fiendishly intelligent, too.
You should have seen him in April and May, swooping about like a bat.
In a carriage, riding a mule, or on foot, rain or shine.
Wherever he went, secret groups were formed...
...preparing the way for those who were to come.
A scourge of God, Excellency.
We've only seen the start of
Don Calogero's career.
In a few months, he'll be a member of the parliament in Turin.
In a few years, when the church's property is auctioned off...
...for a handful of coins...
...he'll pick up their land at
Fondacello...
...and become the biggest landowner in the province.
There, that's who Don Calogero is...
...an example of the new man.
It's a pity he has to be like that.
And the rest of the family?
What are the others like?
Nobody has seen Calogero's wife for years.
Except myself, perhaps.
She comes out only to go to first Mass, at five, when no one's about.
Once I got up early specially, just to see her.
Word of honour, she's as beautiful as the sun.
You can't blame him, cockroach though he is, for keeping her from other men.
But even from the best-guarded houses...
...word trickles out, servants talk.
It seems that Donna Bastiana is a kind of animal.
Illiterate, can't tell the time, she hardly knows how to speak.
She's incapable, too, of loving her daughter.
Good for bed, and that's all.
Besides, it can't be otherwise.
Do you know whose daughter she was?
One of your share-croppers at Runci.
Peppe Giunta his name was.
He was so foul-smelling and uncouth, everyone called him Peppe Shit.
Excuse the word, Excellency.
Two years after Don Calogero ran off with Bastiana...
...Peppe was found dead with twelve shotgun pellets in his back.
And I hoped that Tancredi would marry Concetta.
He's a traitor, like all such liberals.
First he betrayed the king, and now us.
He with his false face...
...with his words dripping honey and his actions dripping poison.
This is what happens...
...when you take into your house people not of your own blood.
I always said so, but nobody listens to me.
I never could stand that dandy.
You alone were enamoured of him.
And now he has the effrontery to ask you, his uncle, Prince of Salina...
...father of the girl he's deceived, to take his proposal to that rogue...
...the father of that trollop...
Fabrizio, you shall not do it!
You don't know what you're saying.
Angelica is not a trollop.
She may become one, but now she's like any other girl, only more beautiful...
...who simply wants to make a good marriage.
Maybe she's a little in love with our
Tancredi, as they all are, after all.
And she has a lot of money, Stella.
Our money, largely, administered well, too well even, by Don Calogero.
Tancredi needs that money.
He's a nobleman, ambitious, spendthrift.
He needs a lot of money.
As for Concetta, he's never said anything to her, so he's no traitor.
He moves with his times, that's all.
Both in politics and in private life.
Besides, he's the dearest young man
I know. Even you know that.
I want no whimpering in my house, either in my room or in my bed.
No more "You shall not do it".
I make the decisions.
I decided this long ago.
And now no more about it.
Now let us sleep.
Tomorrow I am getting up early to go hunting.
You've told me about them all: wild mothers and faecal grandfathers...
...but nothing about what interests me, about Angelica.
There's nothing to say.
She speaks for herself.
Her mother's beauty without her grandfather's stench. A real lady.
When she returned from college she played me the old mazurka I wrote.
She played badly, but to see her was a delight...
...with her black hair, those eyes, that skin, that bosom.
Some difference from the stink of goats.
Her sheets must have the fragrance of paradise.
Calm down, Don Ciccio.
From now on you'll have to speak of Angelica with all due respect.
This very day I'm asking Calogero for her hand for my nephew Tancredi.
You're the first to know, but you'll pay for this privilege.
You'll be locked up in the gun-room with the dogs...
...until after Calogero's visit.
I want nothing to leak out in advance.
This is disgraceful, obscene.
He can't marry the daughter of your enemies.
They've always opposed you.
If he seduced her, that would be a conquest, but this is pure surrender.
It's the end of the Falconeri family and the Salinas.
The marriage is not the end of anything, but the start.
And it's in our best traditions.
These are things you can't understand.
Let's go home.
And we're agreed, aren't we?
Let there be no misunderstanding, or a big fuss over a little kiss.
Remember, it was I who asked you to come here.
I wish to tell you about a letter written by my nephew...
...received this very night, in fact.
In it he declares his love for your daughter...
...and asks me to ask you...
...officially, for Angelica's hand.
Now it's your turn to declare your intentions.
Excuse me, Prince.
This lovely surprise has robbed me of speech.
I know well what Angelica feels in her heart and mind...
...and I think that Tancredi's feelings, which honour us all...
...are sincerely reciprocated.
We ask for God's protection for this wedding.
Your joy is mine, Excellency.
It's turning stormy.
No need for me to tell you how illustrious the Falconeri family is.
It came to Sicily with Charles of Anjou, flourished under the Aragons...
...the Spanish kings and the Bourbons, if you'll allow me to mention them.
They were peers of the realm, grandees of Spain, Knights of St. James.
But if there's no need to tell you of the history of the house of Falconeri...
...I need not tell you, alas, because you already know...
...that my nephew's fortune does not match the grandeur of his name.
My brother-in-law was not what one calls a provident father.
The sumptuousness of his life impaired my nephew's inheritance.
But, Don Calogero, the result of all these troubles...
...of these heartbreaks, is Tancredi.
The two of us know these things.
Perhaps it is impossible to be as distinguished...
...sensitive and charming as Tancredi...
...unless ancestors have squandered fortunes. That's how it is in Sicily.
I know all this, and more besides.
But love, Excellency, love is all...
...as I know well.
Now listen
I'm a man of the world and
I'll put my cards on the table, too.
These young people must know what they can count on.
In the marriage contract,
I'll assign to my daughter...
...the deeds to Settesoli.
One thousand and ten hectares.
All wheat fields, first-class land...
...cool and airy...
...and five hundred hectares of vineyards and olive groves...
...at Gibildolce.
On the wedding day
I'll give the bridegroom...
...twenty bags, each with 10,000 uncias.
My family means everything to me.
Nobody has seen Calogero's wife for years.
Except myself, perhaps.
She comes out only to go to first Mass...
...at five, when no one's about.
Once I got up early specially, just to see her.
Word of honour, she's as beautiful as the sun.
You can't blame him, cockroach though he is...
...for keeping her from other men.
Of course, it leaves me a beggar, but a daughter is a daughter.
And after all, Prince,
I know what I'm telling you...
...won't impress you, a descendant of
Emperor Titus and Queen Berenice...
...but the Sedara family, by a title granted by Ferdinand the Fourth...
...is also nobility.
I've all the papers in order. One day it will be known that your nephew...
...has married a baroness, the Baroness Sedara del Biscotto.
Don Pirrone, I've all the papers in order. Just one seal to get.
I'm sorry, Don Ciccio, but I had no choice.
I hope at least that all went well.
Yes, perfectly.
It couldn't have gone better.
We'll meet again soon. And forgive me.
It was a cold January day.
The atmosphere seemed even heavier when the biting north wind dropped.
For many hours it had been snowing great white flakes.
On that deserted road, a poor old horse, a rough blanket on its back...
...wearily dragged a two-wheeled cart.
"Oh, you damned beast", cried the peasant...
...who habitually talked to his horse.
Excellency, Don Tancredi has arrived.
He is in the courtyard having his luggage unloaded.
Not too close, uncle.
I'm as wet as a sponge.
How pleased I am to see you again.
Tancredi, think how happy
Angelica will be.
Forgive me, but my emotion caused me to forget.
My friend, Count Cavriaghi.
He came to the villa with the General.
And there is my orderly, Lancer Moroni.
We were expecting you, but in this weather...
They arrived in this storm.
I'd heard it never rains here.
For two days it was like being in the sea. Really.
Aunt, here's Count Cavriaghi from Milan.
You met him in Palermo.
You thought it never rains in Sicily.
As you've seen, it pours.
And don't think there's no pneumonia here, or you'll end up in bed.
Light fires in Tancredi's room and in the visitor's room.
Get the next room ready for the soldier. Hurry!
I don't understand, boys.
Last time you were lobster-red.
What do you mean?
Don't you Garibaldi fellows wear the red shirt any more?
Garibaldi fellows be blowed!
We were, but now that's over.
Cavriaghi and I, thank heaven...
...are officers of the regular army of His Majesty the King of Italy.
When Garibaldi's army was disbanded we had the choice: either return home, or stay in the royal army.
We and many others decided to join the proper army.
We couldn't stay with that lot, could we, Cavriaghi?
What rabble!
Assault troops, good for firing guns, that's all.
Now we're proper officers.
People no longer fear we'll steal their chickens.
When we came here from Palermo...
...we had only to say: "Urgent orders for His Majesty" to get fresh horses.
Tell me everything later.
Now go and change and have a bath.
First I want to show you the ring for Angelica.
I'm no judge, but it looks valuable.
Beautiful, isn't it? Do you like it?
Did you pay a lot for it?
I used your money well. I confess
I haven't used all you gave me.
- There was even enough to buy...
- Some parting gifts? I understand.
Our lieutenant is back. What is that?
A small present for signorina Concetta.
"The Poems of Aleardi". I hope she likes it.
They are poems by Aleardi, my favourite poet.
I brought it as a gift.
I've had your monogram inscribed here.
"Always deaf"? What does it mean?
I hear perfectly.
Deaf to my sighs.
Excuse me, but I was told...
A gift for you from your Tancredi.
You can thank my uncle, too.
Angelica! Tancredi! Where are you?
It's mouse-ridden.
Come along.
Angelica, where are you?
Tancredi, where are you?
How frightening.
Do you know there are mice here?
I'm sure, in this house.
But where is Tancredi?
I can't find him.
Tancredi! Angelica! Where are you?
I frightened you, didn't I?
There she is again. Let's run away.
No. Where are we going?
I'm dead tired.
How big the place is.
How many rooms are there?
No one knows, not even my uncle.
He says a palace where you know all the rooms isn't worth living in.
- Come on, the poor thing is alone.
- What about the others?
Concetta has gone back to the garden.
Francesco Paolo was sent by your uncle...
...to welcome a guest.
- Who is he?
- I don't know. He's from Turin.
Then let's go.
No, I don't want to see anything else
I'm leaving. What am I doing here?
Concetta doesn't love me.
Have you spoken to her?
It's useless. I feel that for her...
...I'm just a worm. So I must find a lady worm who'll be happy with me.
Talk to her. There'll be time later to decide. Maybe it's all for the best.
I'll explain: Concetta's a pure Sicilian, she's never left the island.
How would she cope in Milan, where it takes a month to find real macaroni?
I'd have got her crates of your macaroni, bigger than this.
We'll make our way separately, then?
Poor Count, it's useless.
Concetta does not want to know him.
She's foolish.
After all, what does she want?
Cavriaghi is handsome, has a good name, owns land in Brianza.
He's what's known as a good catch.
Concetta is still in love with you.
That's why you brought him here.
Yes, that's what I think.
No, I'll tell you.
Then listen carefully. Concetta's right.
Marrying someone like him after loving you would be like water after...
- After what?
- Let's say Marsala wine.
Strange rooms. How could anyone have lived in such apartments?
No one has ever lived here, my love.
My ancestors came here to commit their little breaches of the rules...
...and obtain special memories so different from ordinary mortals.
Breaches of the rules?
They were bored, my love.
Are you the Chevalier Aymone
Chevalley de Monterzuolo?
I am.
I am the Prince of Salina's son.
My father sent me to invite you to stay with us at the palace.
That's very kind of you.
Do replace your hat. Our sun is strong.
Thank you. You, too.
I did intend to leave as soon as
I had talked with the Prince.
In any case, to talk to my father you'll have to come home.
Is that the palace up there?
Where are Tancredi and Angelica?
Not upstairs.
They must have returned to the garden.
It's terrible. You know I must chaperone Angelica.
Do you think I won't love you any more?
You're afraid.
I desire you, but I won't possess you until you are my wife.
My poor leg, I'm afraid.
Here's the guest.
What does he want from you?
I don't know. He's travelled round
Sicily for a month. He must be forlorn.
The oil in our cooking must have sorely tried his insides.
He fears a brigand's knife in the stomach, which he still cherishes.
I'd like to suggest we play whist.
What do you say to a game of cards?
Excellency, if I could have the honour of a talk. I must leave tomorrow.
Leave tomorrow?
Are you not comfortable here?
Yes, certainly.
My dear Chevalley, you are in my house...
...and I'll hold you hostage as long as I please.
Beware of Father Pirrone, he's a terror. He always wins.
Please be seated. I'll be your partner.
I'll keep the score.
Excuse me, are you really from Milan?
However did you end up down here?
Although I abuse the Prince's hospitality,
I feel much at home here.
Let me be your guide in Donnafugata.
I'll show you Baron Mutolo's house.
Francesco Paulo, don't start that.
It's empty. The family lives at Girgenti...
...since brigands held the Baron's son for ransom ten years ago.
When I think what they must have paid to free him.
They paid nothing. They had no ready cash, like everybody here.
The son was returned, anyway, but in installments
In installments? What are you saying?
Yes, installments: piece by piece.
First came the index finger of his right hand.
Then, a week later, his left foot.
Finally, in a basket under a layer of figs...
...they sent his head.
That's enough of those stories.
I never saw it because I was a child, but my father told me.
I'd say the Bourbon police were incompetent.
Without doubt, Chevalley.
We had incidents in our region.
My father was an overseer...
...a risky job, at least until a while ago...
...for him and for his family.
When our carabinieri come here, all this will end.
So, contrary to certain propaganda...
...respect for the church will be restored and defended as it once was.
Let us hope a little better...
...because five years ago a curate was murdered while he conducted Mass.
How horrible. A shooting in the church?
Shooting, my dear Chevalley?
We're too good Catholics to do anything so sacrilegious.
No, they simply put poison in the communion wine.
More discreet, almost liturgical,
I'd say.
But who did it? The curate was an excellent person who had no enemies.
Very interesting, Prince, really amusing.
You should write novels.
You tell these stories so well.
Yes, they're all stories.
Believe me, I'm from Milan.
Sicily is a great country.
After the happy annexation...
...that is, after the happy union of
Sicily and the Kingdom of Sardinia...
...it's the intention of the
Turin government...
...to nominate certain illustrious
Sicilians as Senators of the Kingdom.
Of course, your name was among the first.
A name made illustrious by its long history...
...by the prestige of its bearer...
...his erudition and the dignified and liberal action taken in recent events.
Before I send the list to Turin...
...my superiors thought it proper to inform you yourself...
...and ask if you find the proposal acceptable.
The government hopes very much that you will agree.
This is the object of my mission...
...which has given me the honour of knowing you and this fine palace.
Explain to me, Chevalley...
...what does it mean to be a Senator?
What is it? An honorary title, like a decoration?
The Senate is the Upper House of our kingdom.
In it they examine and debate...
...approve or reject laws proposed by government for the country's progress.
When you are a Senator...
...you'll make heard the voice of your beautiful land...
...which now faces the panorama of the modern world...
...with so many wounds to heal, so many just desires to satisfy.
Listen, Chevalley.
I'm grateful to the government for thinking of me for the Senate.
If it were a simple honorary title to put on my visiting card...
...I'd accept with pleasure.
But as it is... no, I cannot accept.
I am a spokesman of the old class...
...fatally compromised with the past régime...
...bound to it by bonds of decency, if not affection.
My unhappy generation straddles two worlds and is uneasy in either.
Moreover, I am completely without illusions.
What would the Senate do with me, an inexperienced legislator...
...who lacks self-deception, which is essential when seeking to guide others?
No, I wouldn't put one finger into politics. They'd bite it off.
Prince, I can't believe it.
Are you seriously refusing to do whatever possible to alleviate...
...the material poverty and blind moral misery in which Sicilians lie?
We are old, Chevalley, very old.
For twenty-five centuries we have borne magnificent civilizations...
...all from abroad, none made by us, none which started here.
For 2,500 years we've been nothing but a colony.
I don't say that to scourge myself.
It's our fault.
But we are very tired, empty, burnt-out.
But all that is finished now.
Sicily is no longer a land of conquest, but a free part of a free state.
The intention is good, but it arrives late.
A sleep, my dear Chevalley.
A long sleep is what the Sicilians want...
...and they'll always hate those who want to wake them...
...even if it is to bring them marvellous gifts.
Between ourselves, I doubt if the new kingdom will have many gifts for us.
With us, every demonstration, even violent, is a longing for oblivion.
Our sensuality is a desire for oblivion.
Our shootings and our stabbings are the desire for death.
Our laziness, the penetrating sweetness of our sorbets...
...are a desire for voluptuous immobility, which again is death.
Prince, aren't you exaggerating?
I've met Sicilians in Turin.
They seemed anything but sluggards.
I haven't explained very well.
I'm sorry.
I said Sicilians, I meant Sicily.
This environment, the violence of the landscape...
...the cruelty of the climate, the continuous tension in everything.
But the climate can be mastered, the landscape can be modified...
...the record of bad governments erased.
Of course, the Sicilians will want to improve.
I don't deny that some, away from the island, can succeed in awakening.
But they must leave very young.
Even at twenty the shell has been formed.
The man you need...
...must know how to temper his private interests with vague public idealism.
Might I give you some advice to pass on to your superiors?
There's a name I'd like to suggest for the Senate.
The name of Calogero Sedara.
He deserves much more than I to be elected.
The family name, I'm told, is very ancient - or will be soon.
He has more than what you call prestige. He has power.
He may not be learned, but he has almost exceptional practical merits.
His activity was most useful during the May crisis...
...as far as illusions go.
I don't think he has more than I have...
...but he's clever enough to create some himself. He's the man for you.
I've heard tell about Sedara.
But if honest men like you withdraw...
...the road will be open to people without scruples or perspective...
...like Sedara, and for centuries to come all will be as it was.
Listen to your conscience, Prince, not to the proud truths you spoke.
I beg you to collaborate.
You're a gentleman and I consider it a privilege to have known you.
You are right in everything.
Except when you say the Sicilians will want to improve.
They'll never want to improve because they think themselves perfect.
Their vanity is stronger than their wretchedness.
Sit down for a moment.
I want to tell you something.
A few days before Garibaldi entered Palermo...
...some English naval officers...
...asked me if they could go on the terrace of my house...
...where they could see the ring of mountains around the city.
They were enthusiastic about the view...
...but confessed their amazement at the squalor and filth in the streets.
I didn't explain, as I did with you, that the one derived from the other.
One of the officers asked:
"What are Garibaldi's men coming to do here?"
I replied: "They're coming to teach us manners."
"But they won't succeed, because we're gods."
They laughed, but I don't think they understood.
It's late, almost time for dinner.
We must go and change.
If you wish, you can leave tomorrow at dawn.
Even if you don't believe me, this state of affairs won't last.
Our efficient, modern administration will change everything.
This state of affairs ought not to last, but it always will.
The human element, certainly.
A century or two.
Later, perhaps everything will be different, but it will be worse.
We were the leopards, the lions.
Those who replace us will be the jackals, the hyenas.
And all of us, leopards, lions, jackals and sheep...
...will continue to think we're the salt of the earth.
I don't quite understand.
What did you say?
Nothing.
What did you say? I didn't hear.
You've arrived early. Don't worry, there's no sign of your guests yet.
Tancredi's here. We're expecting
Pallavicino, the hero of Aspromonte.
Thank you again, aunt.
It was essential to invite them.
You understand. This will be
Angelica's real début in society.
What about Calogero's tail-suit?
It's not the one he wore at Donnafugata.
I took him to the best tailor.
It's Don Calogero who lacks style.
- Mamma, may I go and dance?
- Of course. Tidy yourself a little.
You are very beautiful, like a flower.
I don't care for these balls, but one had to come for the girls.
Colonel, I am most honoured to see you.
I have the honour to present you to Colonel Pallavicino.
I am proud and happy to receive the victor of Aspromonte in my house.
How kind, Princess.
It is I who am happy on this occasion.
I hope you and your officers will spend a pleasant evening in our home.
It really is an honour for us.
All Palermo is at your feet, Colonel.
The Princess of Lampedusa.
Countess Sutera.
The Princess of Salina.
I'm going to see if Angelica has arrived.
Colonel, but tell us, is it really true?
I was crying, Countess, like a child.
How moving.
But what was Garibaldi like?
He was handsome and serene as an archangel.
Magnificent, a hero. A real hero.
Isn't he extraordinary, my dear?
The Colonel is trying to reassure them after his men fired on Garibaldi's men.
Those shots were really most opportune.
You're late. I was waiting for you.
You are very beautiful.
Come and greet the Princess.
Permit me to present my fiancé,
Angelica Sedara.
My dear, let me look at you.
Yes, it's true.
You are more beautiful than they say.
- What's this?
- Knight's Cross of the Italian Crown.
It's out of place here.
I've never doubted your good taste.
My father-in-law, the Chevalier Don Calogero Sedara.
- Nice here, isn't it, Princess?
- You like it?
Tancredi, don't you want to present me to your fiancé?
Allow me to present a friend,
Gioacchino Lanza.
And this is Fulco...
Tancredi may protest, but may I have the honour of the next waltz?
All right, boys.
Don't hurry, there'll be time later.
I'm sorry, I'm not to blame.
The lady has to choose her partners.
It's a waltz. Shall we dance?
- I haven't greeted your uncle yet.
- Do it later. Come and dance.
You are very beautiful, as always.
It's the truth.
Bored, Fabrizio?
All these marriages between cousins do not improve the beauty of the race.
They look like monkeys, ready to climb up the chandeliers...
...where they'll swing by their tails, exhibiting their behinds.
Eleonora Giardinelli...
...a white swan in a pond full of frogs.
My compliments on your nephew's engagement.
The girl's a beauty.
Many will soon follow his example.
What did you say?
I said it's hot, too hot here.
Yes, it is hot. I should not have come.
I'm somewhat tired, but now I'm here and I must stay.
It would be discourteous to leave now.
Good evening. Tina, I have four dances booked with Giovanni.
Princess, I'd be most happy if you would do me the honour...
Colonel, it's years since I danced... so many lovely ladies are here...
Nice, Prince, really beautiful.
Places like this aren't made nowadays, with the current price of gold.
Yes, very nice, truly beautiful.
But nothing equals our two young people.
Angelica wanted to greet you.
But why are you here alone?
Are you flirting with death?
You're really magnificent.
Isn't it odd that Don Diego keeps this morbid picture?
If Don Diego enters this library once a year, it's a miracle.
Yes, you're right.
I wonder if my death will resemble this.
The linen will not be so spotless.
The sheets of the dying are always so soiled...
...and I hope that Concetta and the others will be more decently dressed.
But I think all in all it will be the same.
What are you saying, uncle?
What are you thinking of?
I often think of death.
The idea doesn't frighten me.
You young people cannot understand such things.
For you, death does not exist, it's something for other people.
We must have repairs done to our family vault.
Give me your handkerchief, please.
We knew you were here and we came for a rest...
...but also to ask you something.
I hope you won't refuse me.
I wanted to ask you to dance the next mazurka with me.
Don't be lazy. Everyone knows you're a good dancer.
I've never had such an attractive proposal, but I must refuse.
Please, Prince.
You make me feel young again.
I accept, but not the mazurka.
That would make me feel too young.
Grant me the next waltz.
See how good your uncle is.
He doesn't have tantrums like you.
He didn't want me to ask you.
He's jealous.
When one has a handsome uncle like him, it's natural to be jealous.
But this time I'll make an exception.
A waltz, without even having to ask the orchestra. Do you like it?
It's a waltz. Or perhaps you have already changed your mind.
No, of course not.
They're all so kind and I'm so happy, uncle.
Tancredi is a darling, and so are you.
It's as well Tancredi can't hear you.
I know I owe everything to you.
So does Tancredi.
Because if you had not wanted...
He'd have married you, anyway.
You owe everything to yourself.
No, it's not true.
It is true, Angelica.
No man like Tancredi would ever have resisted your beauty.
I'd heard that you were a good dancer, Prince.
I'm sorry to have disappointed you again.
You're much more than a good dancer, you're a really delightful dancer.
Yes, it's my father.
- The next dance.
- A mazurka, then.
They're all looking at us, Prince.
What a beautiful girl that is, dancing with your father.
The applause was muted, because a lion commands respect...
...but you deserved an ovation.
And now come to our table.
No, my memories of my youth are still vivid and I know very well...
...how boring it would be for you to dine with an old uncle.
That's not true.
It is. Lovers wish to be alone.
Anyway, I am not very hungry.
Go with Tancredi and don't think of me.
Fabrizio, you're still a good dancer.
Fabrizio, how are you?
Fabrizio, aren't you eating?
You seem a little uncertain.
The choice is too great.
Donna Margherita knows how to do things.
All this calls for stomachs other than mine.
How marvellous these candelabra are.
From Madrid. A gift to Don Diego's grandfather when he was ambassador.
How much land would they be worth, eh?
The utmost emotion of my life.
What a great bore.
Prince Salina. Will you do us the honour of sitting at our table?
Now the left wants to crucify me, because...
...in August I ordered my lads to open fire on Garibaldi.
But, Prince, what else could I do, with the written orders I had?
I must confess, though...
...when at Aspromonte I faced those hundreds of Garibaldi's men...
...some hardened veterans...
...others who looked like professional rebels...
I was happy those orders were so close to my own sentiments.
Then, I'll tell you in confidence...
...my short burst of shooting helped Garibaldi above all.
I liberated him from the gang that had attached itself to him...
...who were using him for ends desired perhaps by Paris or Rome.
Yes, it's true.
Individuals very different from those who landed at Marsala two years ago.
People who thought Italy could be created with revolutions like in 1848.
He... I mean General Garibaldi, as you know...
...at the moment of my now famous genuflection, he shook my hand.
Do you know what he said to me quietly?
"Thank you, Colonel."
"For what?" I asked. "For laming you for the rest of your life?"
No, but for making him understand, to see with his own eyes the swaggering...
...the vile behaviour and perhaps worse of his dubious adherents.
Please excuse me, dear Colonel.
Don't you think your bows and compliments overdid things a bit?
No. Certainly no.
You should have seen him, that poor, great man...
...lying under a chestnut tree, suffering in his body...
...but even more in his spirit.
Pitiful.
Didn't he say himself, when landing again in Sicily:
"We are going towards the unknown."
It was difficult to resist emotion.
Besides, why should I have resisted?
I kiss the hand of ladies only.
But then, Prince, I also kissed the hand of the salvation of the kingdom...
...which is also a lady to whom we military men must pay homage.
I ask your pardon. Diego, excuse me.
Three balls in one week, it's too much.
I can't wait for it to end.
I can't think why everybody is so merry.
Give me a hairpin.
How boring.
Until we've finished with all these invitations, we must stay in the city.
I can't wait to return to our villa at San Lorenzo, to our quiet life.
What are you saying? I'd like this ball to go on for ever, it's lovely.
What will the Trabias' ball be like?
I've ordered a green dress.
Bright green.
How about you?
I'm so happy. Tancredi is so sweet.
You are all so sweet to me.
I wish you were happier.
What can I do about it?
I've never liked being among people.
I don't even like dancing.
I've never been able to dance well.
It depends on your partner.
Find a partner you like.
No, I'm not interested.
Do you know how many young men would be happy to court you?
You discourage them all.
Like poor Cavriaghi, remember?
How you treated him, poor man.
There you are.
I couldn't find you anywhere.
We're tidying ourselves. Anyway,
I couldn't find you, you had vanished.
I went to hear what the Colonel was saying.
He's no genius, but he says many very sensible things.
It's true, the new kingdom needs order, legality, laws.
It needs to stifle, first of all...
...any attempts at anarchy.
No more adventures or disorders.
Even if that entails severe or painful methods...
...like shooting those hotheads who deserted to go back with Garibaldi.
Do you think they'll shoot them?
Didn't you know? This morning at dawn.
And it's right. They were deserters.
You would not have spoken like that once.
My dear, you are mistaken.
I've always spoken like this.
Therefore, these are things you cannot understand.
Concetta, wait.
Let me go!
I think I understand very well.
I said you wouldn't have spoken like that once. That's enough for me.
She's so sweet, especially when she becomes angry.
Poor Concetta. The truth is, she's still in love with you.
- And are you still in love with me?
- Yes.
Have you seen the Prince of Salina?
Don Calogero, it's time to go.
Pull yourself together.
Coffee, please. Hot coffee.
Thank you for this unforgettable evening.
Must you go already?
We're going straight to the barracks, as tradition demands of us soldiers.
Our duty obliges us.
Moreover, our tasks for this night are not yet over.
Tidy up a little and extinguish the candles.
Dear Margherita, thank you so much for the wonderful evening. Magnificent.
There you are.
Aunt is looking for you everywhere.
Angelica, Concetta and Carolina are ready to leave.
Can you do me a favour, my boy?
I've already said my farewells.
Will you call the carriage for your aunt? I'm walking back.
- Walking? At this hour?
- I need some air.
Don't you feel well?
A slight headache. Fresh air will help.
Everything went very well, don't you think?
Marvellously, uncle. You know,
I'll soon have some good news for you.
I just spoke to Finzori.
It seems that at the next elections...
You'll be the candidate.
You knew about it?
Excuse me for a moment.
O star, O faithful star!
When will you decide to give me a less fleeting appointment...
...far from everything, in your realm of perennial certainty?
An excellent army.
They do things properly.
Just what we needed...
...for Sicily.
Now we can take it easy.
Man: GET THIS ON THE TWIX,
WILL YOU, NELL?
I'VE SAID IT ONCE,
I'VE SAID IT A HUNDRED TIMES!
I KNOW, D.J.
NOW, ABOUT SEATTLE --
DON'T MISS THE MEETING
ON THE 23rd.
Woman: MR. MULROONEY,
- THE BOSTON PLANE IS ON TIME.
THEN I'D BETTER BE GOING.
CAN'T KEEP THESE PEOPLE WAITING.
HOW ABOUT
THE HENDERSON DEAL?
I WANTED YOU TO OKAY THIS,
D.J.
OH, NOT ANOTHER ELECTRONICS
COMPANY, PAUL.
WELL, WE CAN PICK IT UP
FOR A SONG,
AND SINCE WE'VE GONE
INTO PLASTICS SO HEAVILY --
PLASTICS, TOYS,
ELECTRONICS -- WHAT NEXT?
THERE'S ONE THING
YOU YOUNG FELLOWS
SEEM TO FORGET --
WE ARE IN THE LUMBER BUSINESS.
WE STARTED OUT IN LUMBER,
AND LUMBER IS STILL NUMBER ONE.
OF COURSE, D.J.
BUT IF IT'LL MAKE YOU HAPPY,
GO AHEAD AND BUY IT.
WELL, THANK YOU, SIR!
OH, NOT THAT ONE, GREGG --
THE ROLLS.
THE ROLLS -- RIGHT, SIR.
MAY I HAVE YOUR UNDIVIDED
ATTENTION FOR 30 SECONDS?
YES, RALPH.
I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH
THE SUCCESS
OF THE SEATTLE DEAL
DEPENDS ON YOUR BEING THERE.
WELL, I'LL DO MY BEST
TO MAKE IT,
BUT IN CASE I MISS,
YOU'VE GOT ALL THE FACTS.
THEY DON'T WANT ME
OR LOGAN OR WINKLER!
THEY'VE BEEN PROMISED
D.J. MULROONEY.
THEY WANT THAT 50,000 ACRES
OF TIMBER! THAT'S OUR BAIT!
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT
IN SEATTLE,
THE WHOLE DEAL
GOES DOWN THE DRAIN.
I'LL BE THERE, RALPH.
NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE
STOP WORRYING?
AH, THERE SHE IS --
AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE DAY
I FIRST BROUGHT HER HOME.
WE HAD JUST PUT TOGETHER
THAT SAGATUCK LUMBER DEAL.
AND ALL THE PROFITS
WENT RIGHT INTO THIS CAR.
I REMEMBER PERFECTLY.
THAT WAS IN THE DAYS
WHEN I ONLY HAD $1 MILLION.
YOU STILL
HAVE TO IMPRESS PEOPLE.
I'LL BE DOING MY OWN DRIVING.
YES, SIR.
SPECIAL OCCASION.
I'M MEETING
SOME VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE.
YOU'VE ONLY GOT A HALF AN HOUR
TO GET TO THE AIRPORT.
DON'T WORRY, I'LL MAKE IT.
I ALWAYS DO, DON'T I?
[ TIRES SCREECH ]
FIVE MINUTES EARLY!
WHY DON'T YOU RUN
YOUR PLANES ON TIME?!
IT WAS THE TAIL WIND,
MR. MULROONEY!
WELL, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT I SHOULD BE HERE
TO MEET THEM.
WHERE ARE THEY?!
WHERE --
GRANDFATHER!
HI, GRANDFATHER.
HI, RODNEY.
MY GOODNESS,
BUT YOU'VE GROWN!
AND ELIZABETH...
YOU LOOK MORE LIKE YOUR MOTHER
EVERY TIME I SEE YOU.
HOW IS SHE?
FINE. SHE TOLD ME
TO GIVE YOU HER LOVE.
AND DAD SAID HE'LL BRING YOU
CHAMPAGNE FROM PARIS.
THAT'S THE SORT OF
SON-IN-LAW I LIKE.
HOW WERE THESE PASSENGERS?
WELL BEHAVED, I HOPE?
THE PERFECT TRAVELERS.
IT WAS A PLEASURE TO HAVE THEM.
GOODBYE, ELIZABETH.
- GOODBYE.
GOODBYE, RODNEY.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WHERE ARE WE GOING,
GRANDFATHER?
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE'D
HEAD UP THE REDWOOD HIGHWAY.
I USED TO TAKE YOUR MOTHER THERE
WHEN SHE WAS YOUR AGE.
THEN WE'LL FOLLOW OUR NOSES
ON UP TO SEATTLE.
SEATTLE!
CAN WE GO ON THE YACHT?!
I'VE GOT A NEW ONE NOW --
4,000 HORSEPOWER DIESEL.
DOES 25 KNOTS
IF SHE'S PUSHED.
OH, BOY!
COST NEARLY
$1 MILLION DOLLARS.
WELL, HOW COME
IF YOU'RE SO RICH
YOU DRIVE A FUNNY OLD CAR
LIKE THIS?
FUNNY OLD CAR?!
I TELL YOU, YOUNG MAN,
THIS IS A FINE CAR!
YOU WON'T FIND ITS LIKE
ANYMORE.
WELL, IT'S CERTAINLY
A PRETTY CAR.
YES, BUT HOW FAST
DOES IT GO?
OH, FAST ENOUGH
TO GET US THERE.
WHEN I GET A CAR,
IT'S GONNA BE A MASERATI.
RODNEY, YOU'RE ALWAYS
TALKING SO BIG!
THERE'S NO HARM
IN THAT, SON.
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG LAD
IN IRELAND,
I ALWAYS DREAMT OF OWNING MYSELF
A JAUNTING CAR.
A JAUNTING CAR?
NEVER HEARD OF THAT MAKE.
WELL, RODNEY, MY BOY,
IT WAS THE MASERATI
OF ITS TIME -- REAL COOL.
HOT STUFF -- ONE HORSEPOWER.
ONE HORSEPOWER?!
YES, SIR!

[ LAUGHING ]
LUNCHTIME.
GREAT!
WHERE'S THE RESTAURANT?
RIGHT HERE -- I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE FUN
TO HAVE OUR FIRST MEAL TOGETHER
IN THE OPEN AIR!
LOOK, RODNEY!
"MULROONEY GROVE."
GRANDFATHER, ARE THESE
WONDERFUL TREES ALL YOURS?
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM --
MINE, YOURS, EVERYBODY'S.
WHAT DID YOU DO,
BUY 'EM?
ALL THAT SIGN MEANS IS
THAT I HAD THE PRIVILEGE
OF SEEIN' THAT
THEY'LL ALWAYS BE HERE.
JUST FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AT?
EXACTLY.
MY, THEY'RE BIG!
MUST HAVE TAKEN
A LONG TIME TO GROW.
4,000 YEARS
FOR SOME OF THEM.
TUNA...
HAM...
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL...
LIKE BEING IN FAIRYLAND.
NOW, DON'T GO
TOO FAR AWAY NOW.
RODNEY'S HUNGRY,
AND THERE MIGHT NOT BE
ANYTHING LEFT
WHEN YOU GET BACK.
THERE'S NO PEANUT BUTTER
AND JELLY.
OH, DIG DOWN.
THEY'RE PROBABLY
DOWN THERE IN THE BOTTOM.
YOU KNOW, SHE --
SHE COULD BE THE ONE.
I WOULDN'T IF I WERE YOU.
DON'T DO IT.
WELL, BUT OF ALL OF 'EM
I'VE SEEN,
SHE'S THE ONE
I THINK I COULD TRUST.
YOU CAN'T TRUST ANY OF 'EM.
THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT!
BUT I HAVE TO TALK
TO SOMEONE.
TALK TO ME...
ANY TIME.
AND US --
JUST AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE.
I HAVE TALKED TO YA --
ALL OF YA --
AND THERE'S NOT ONE OF YOU THAT
CAN HELP ME WITH MY PROBLEM!
DON'T DO IT, JASPER.
ONLY MEAN TROUBLE.
WHAT TROUBLE?!
GNOME HUNTERS, THAT'S WHAT!
GNOME HUNTERS
ALL OVER THE PLACE!
OUR WOODS WILL BE FULL OF 'EM!
AND NONE OF 'EM
CAN KEEP THEIR MOUTHS SHUT!
BLAB, BLAB, BLAB!
NO PEACE FOR ANY OF US
ANYMORE.
NO PEACE AT ALL.
NO PEACE AT ALL.
MY MIND'S MADE UP.
AAH!
I, UH, DIDN'T MEAN
TO FRIGHTEN YA.
OH, YOU DIDN'T.
BUT I'LL BET YOU'RE SURPRISED
TO SEE A GNOME.
OH, NOT REALLY.
I WAS JUST THINKING
WHAT A LOVELY PLACE
THIS IS FOR GNOMES.
ARE THERE MANY OF YOU
LIVING HERE?
WELL,
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT,
I WOULDN'T BE SHOWIN' MYSELF
TO A DOO-DEEN.
A DOO-DEEN?
THAT'S WHAT WE CALL
YOU BIG PEOPLE.
AM I THE FIRST DOO-DEEN
YOU'VE EVER SPOKEN TO?
YEAH, YEAH.
ALL MY FRIENDS
ADVISED AGAINST IT,
BUT I HAD TO TALK
TO SOMEONE!
IF I'M THE FIRST DOO-DEEN
YOU'VE EVER SPOKEN TO,
HOW SHOULD YOU SPEAK
SUCH GOOD ENGLISH?
UH, ENGLISH?
THE LANGUAGE
WE'VE BEEN TALKING!
WELL,
DON'T THAT BEAT ALL?!
AND HERE
I'VE BEEN WONDERIN'
HOW YOU SPOKE
SUCH GOOD GNOMISH!
AND ME FATHER NO MORE THAN TOOK
HIS EYES OFF THE LEPRECHAUN
FOR LESS TIME
THAN IT TAKES TO SAY,
"SEANNY O'SHANNON'S SHILLELAGH,"
WHEN WOOSH!
THE LITTLE CREATURE
UP AND DISAPPEARED ON 'EM.
YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
IN THAT SILLY STUFF,
DO YOU, GRANDFATHER?
THERE'S STILL
NO PEANUT BUTTER.
OH, THEY PROBABLY
GOT THE LABELS MIXED.
GRANDFATHER, COME QUICKLY!
I PROMISED HIM WE'D BE BACK!
PROMISED WHO?
THE GNOME!
- THE WHAT?!
THE GNOME, AND HE'S GOT
A SIMPLY AWFUL PROBLEM!
OH, NOT JUST A GNOME,
BUT A GNOME WITH A PROBLEM!
NOW, THAT IS SOMETHING!
HEY, I FOUND ONE!
GRANDFATHER, HE'S WAITING
TO TALK TO YOU!
BUT WHY ME?
BECAUSE I TOLD HIM
IF ANYONE COULD HELP HIM
WITH HIS PROBLEM, IT WAS YOU!
HE'S WAITING!
WELL, COME ON, RODNEY.
WE GOT TO GO TALK
TO A GNOME.
NOW, ELIZABETH...
ON THE POSSIBILITY
THIS FELLOW ISN'T THERE --
ABOUT 6 INCHES HIGH?
TALLER THAN THAT.
LITTLE YELLOW CAP
AND BUCKLES ON HIS SHOES?
HIS HAT WAS GREEN.
IN ALL THE STORIES
ABOUT LEPRECHAUNS --
I DIDN'T SAY
HE WAS A LEPRECHAUN!
HE SAID HE WAS A GNOME!
OH, A GNOME!
WELL, THAT'S DIFFERENT!
THAT'S THE PLACE!
I'M HERE -- I'VE BROUGHT HIM!
YOO-HOO!
JASPER!
HIS NAME'S JASPER.
OH?
JASPER!
JASPER!
JASPER!
JASPER!
JASPER!
JASPER!
THE GIRL -- ALL RIGHT.
I MAYBE COULD GO ALONG.
BUT HOW ABOUT HIM?
YOU EVER SEEN
A FIERCER-LOOKIN' CRITTER?
HE, UH --
HE DOES LOOK AWFUL SHIFTY
ABOUT THE EYES.
JASPER! JASPER!
MAYBE THIS IS
THE WRONG PLACE.
FORESTS CAN FOOL YOU.
BUT, GRANDFATHER,
THIS WAS THE PLACE!
IT COULD BE
THE LITTLE LEP-- GNOME
HAD SECOND THOUGHTS --
ON SEEING ME, I MEAN.
NOW, A LITTLE GIRL --
THAT'S ONE THING,
BUT AN OLD CURMUDGEON
LIKE MYSELF...
[ CRYING ]
AND IT COULD BE
IN HER IMAGINATION, TOO.
I DIDN'T IMAGINE HIM!
I DID SEE HIM!
OF COURSE YOU SAW
A GNOME, DARLING,
BUT NOT WITH THESE EYES --
THESE UP HERE.
THAT'S WHERE
ALL THE LITTLE FOLKS LIVE,
LIKE GNOMES, ELVES,
LEPRECHAUNS.
BUT, GRANDFATHER,
HONEST, I TALKED TO HIM!
JASPER, JASPER!
They're makin' her into a fool, and all on account of me!
COME ON, DARLING,
WE BEST BE GETTING BACK.
NOW, YOU MUST BE
REALLY HUNGRY --
BUT HE WAS RIGHT THERE!
HE WAS RIGHT THERE!
I can't let it end like this.
HEY, YOU!
SHE DID, TOO, SEE A GNOME!
WHO SAID THAT?!
I THINK IT'S HIM!
Uh-oh.
Now you done it!
COME ON OUT
AND SHOW YOURSELF!
DON'T DO IT, JASPER,
DON'T DO IT!
WHAT KIND OF A TRICK IS THAT
TO PLAY ON A LITTLE GIRL?!
COME ON, DARLING.
OH, GRANDFATHER.
HOLD ON, YOU!
JASPER!
SEANNY O'SHANNON'S
SHILLELAGH!
THERE, GRANDFATHER, YOU SEE?
WHY, UH...
YES...
A GNOME.
YOU SEE HIM, RODNEY?
I STILL THINK
IT'S ELIZABETH'S IMAGINATION.
JASPER, THIS IS
MY BROTHER RODNEY
AND MY GRANDFATHER.
GLAD TO SEE YOU, JASPER.
SAY HELLO TO HIM, RODNEY.
HI.
IS THIS THE WIZARD --
THE ONE WITH ALL THE SOLUTIONS?
SO, YOU'RE THE GNOME
WITH THE PROBLEM.
TELL HIM WHAT YOU TOLD ME!
WELL, INSTEAD OF THAT,
SINCE SEEIN' IS BELIEVIN'
WITH YOU DOO-DEENS,
FOLLOW ME!
COME ON!
WELL, THERE'S MY PROBLEM.
MY OLD GRANDPA JUST LIES THERE
GROWIN' MORE SEE-THROUGHISH
WITH EVERY PASSIN' HOUR.
WHAT'S MAKING HIM
SO SEE-THROUGHISH?
WELL, I'M NOT
AN AUTHORITY ON GNOMES,
BUT IF THEY'RE ANYTHING
LIKE LEPRECHAUNS,
THEY LIVE ON AND ON...
BUT ONLY IF THEY WANT TO.
YOU MEAN
THEY JUST FADE AWAY?
JASPER, HAVE YOU ANY IDEA
WHAT MADE HIM LOSE
HIS WILL TO LIVE?
[ SIGHS ]
GRANDPA'S GIVEN UP ALL HOPE
OF EVER SEEIN' ME MARRIED
AND HAVIN' YOUNGUNS
OF MY OWN.
WHY IS THAT?
WELL...
GRANDPA AND ME,
WE'RE, UH...
WE'RE THE LAST OF THE GNOMES.
THERE'S NO GNOME MAIDENS
FOR ME TO MARRY UP WITH.
WELL, NOW, THAT IS
A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
JASPER...
JASPER, BOY...
IS THAT YOU I HEAR?
I-IT IS, GRANDPA.
I'M, UH -- I'M TALKIN'
WITH SOME FRIENDS.
OH...THAT'S NICE.
THAT'S NICE.
I'M HAPPY FOR YA.
T-THEY'RE, UH...
DOO-DEEN FRIENDS.
MMM, GOOD, GOOD.
NOW, GO A-- DOO-DEENS!
NOW, GRANDPA,
THEY MEAN TO HELP US!
YOU GONE PLUMB
OUT OF YOUR SENSES?!
IT'S DOO-DEENS THAT'S BEEN
THE CAUSE OF ALL OUR TROUBLE!
THESE BIG ONES
ARE DIFFERENT!
THERE AIN'T NO SUCH A THING
AS A DIFFERENT DOO-DEEN!
THAT'S WHY
IN ALL MY 900 YEARS,
I NEVER LET ONE OF 'EM SO MUCH
AS LAY AN EYE ON MY BOOT!
NOW, GRANDPA, IF I MAY --
NOT ONE STEP FURTHER!
AILIN' I MAY BE,
BUT NOT ENOUGH
TO LET YOU GET AHOLD OF ME
WITHOUT PUTTIN' UP A FIGHT!
BUT MY GRANDFATHER
JUST WANTED TO HELP.
HELP?! SAYIN' YOU COULD HELP,
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO?!
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM,
AND MY GRANDFATHER IS GOOD
AT SOLVING PROBLEMS.
WELL, YOU DON'T SAY.
JASPER TOLD ME THAT THERE
ARE RUMORS ABOUT GNOMES
LIVING IN OTHER FORESTS.
AH, IDLE CLUCKIN'
OF GOSSIPY ANIMALS!
AND GRANDFATHER'S GOT
A WONDERFUL CAR,
AND HE'LL DRIVE YOU ANYWHERE,
WON'T YOU, GRANDFATHER?
NOW, JUST A MINUTE, DARLIN'.
AND WHAT ABOUT THE YACHT?!
OH, PLEASE, GRANDFATHER!
WELL, DEAR, I DO HAVE TO BE
IN SEATTLE.
SUPPOSIN' I WAS
TO GO WITH YOU --
I HEAR TELL HOW YOU BIG ONES
TREAT FREE THINGS
IN THE FOREST --
HOW YOU PUT 'EM IN CAGES
AND SELL 'EM AS CURIOSITIES --
EXHIBIT 'EM
TO OTHER DOO-DEENS!
OH, WE'D NEVER DO THAT,
WOULD WE, GRANDFATHER?!
WE'LL GIVE YOU OUR WORD
WE WON'T MENTION
YOUR EXISTENCE
TO ANOTHER SOUL!
NOBODY'D BELIEVE US, ANYWAY.
IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE,
GRANDPA.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
NOT THAT I GOT ANY HOPES
OF FINDIN' GNOMES, MIND YOU,
BUT YOU DO GOT SOMEWHAT OF AN
HONORABLE LOOK ABOUT YOUR EYES.
YAHOO, WE'RE GOING!
YAHOO!
OH, GRANDFATHER,
YOU'RE WONDERFUL!
YIPPEE!
WE'RE GOING!
WELL, IF I MAY COIN A PHRASE,
HE'S JUMPIN' OUT OF
THE FRYIN' PAN INTO THE FIRE --
YES, SIR, SMACK INTO THE FIRE.

WELL, I MUST SAY,
JASPER WAS RIGHT FOR ONCE.
YOU DOO-DEENS ARE DIFFERENT.
THANKS, GRANDPA.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
KEEP CALLIN' ME GRANDPA.
THE NAME'S KNOBBY.
KNOBBY, JUST CALL ME D.J.
EVERYONE DOES.
D.J. -- DON'T COME
MUCH SHORTER THAN THAT.
GRANDFATHER, WHERE DO WE START
THIS GNOME HUNTING?
I FIGURE THE MOST LIKELY PLACE
WOULD BE A VIRGIN FOREST.
NOW, I HAPPEN TO KNOW
OF A 50,000-ACRE PATCH OF TIMBER
THAT'S NEVER BEEN TOUCHED BY --
BY DOO-DEENS.
IS IT VERY FAR?
WE CAN'T MAKE IT TONIGHT.
WE'LL HAVE TO STOP OVER
SOMEWHERE.
BUT WE'LL MAKE IT EASY
IN THE MORNING.
JASPER, WHAT HAPPENED
TO ALL THE OTHER GNOMES?
WELL, I WAS TOO LITTLE
TO REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT IT,
BUT I'VE HEARD IT SAID
THAT THEY MIGRATED.
WEREN'T THAT AT ALL!
WHAT ABOUT
THE FOOD GETTIN' SCARCE?
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU HEARD!
I WAS THERE!
IT WAS THE CHOPPIN' DOWN
OF THE TREES
THAT MADE
THE GNOMES DISAPPEAR!
I REMEMBER IT
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY!
EVERYTHING WAS SO PLEASANT
AND PEACEFUL --
EVERYBODY MINDIN'
THEIR OWN BUSINESS.
THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
"TIMBER!"
TREES STARTED
A-COMIN' DOWN, A-FALLIN'.
AND A-CRASHIN' LIKE GIANTS,
THEY COME DOWN!
IT WAS "TIMBER!" ON THE RIGHT
AND "TIMBER!" ON THE LEFT,
AND THE GNOMES A-PANICKIN'
AND A-RUNNIN'
AND A-FALLIN' DOWN
AND A-BUMPIN' INTO EACH OTHER,
AND COMIN' RIGHT BEHIND 'EM
ALL THE TIME
WAS THE BIG AXES A-SLASHIN'
AND A-CUTTIN' AND "TIMBER!"
GRANDPA, I REMEMBER --
YOU DON'T REMEMBER NOTHIN'!
YOU WEREN'T NO BIGGER THAN THAT!
I GRABBED YOU
AND STARTED TO RUN!
AND RIGHT BEHIND ME I HEAR,
"TIMBER!"
AND I LOOKED BACK
OVER MY SHOULDER,
AND HERE COME ONE OF THEM GIANTS
FALLIN' RIGHT AT ME!
HOW DID YOU ESCAPE?
I DIDN'T!
IT LANDED RIGHT ON ME!
DID IT KILL YOU?!
NOPE. I DUCKED
DOWN A RABBIT HOLE.
BUT I WAS UNDER THAT TREE
FOR 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS!
AND WHEN I FINALLY
DUG MYSELF OUT,
THERE WERE DEAD TREES
EVERYWHERE
AND NARY A GNOME IN SIGHT!
HOW AWFUL!
OH, THE CARNAGE!
AND THEM INFERNAL
AXE-SWINGERS --
THEY WOULDN'T GIVE UP!
THEY KEPT A-COMIN' AND A-COMIN'!
AND THE WORST OF 'EM ALL
WAS THAT MULROONEY OUTFIT!
MULROONEY!
- BUT, GRANDFATHER!
SHH! DON'T INTERRUPT
WHILE HE'S TALKING!
I NEVER SEEN
THE BLACKGUARD HIMSELF,
BUT I SEEN THEM HENCHMEN
OF HIS OFTEN ENOUGH --
A-SLASHIN' AND A-CUTTIN'
AND A-DESTROYIN'!
"MULROONEY'S MARAUDERS"
WE CALLED 'EM!
NOW, JUST A MINUTE!
IT SO HAPPENS
THAT MY GRANDFATHER IS --
IN COMPLETE ACCORD
WITH YOU, KNOBBY!
ANY VANDAL WHO CUTS DOWN TREES
INDISCRIMINATELY OUGHT TO BE --
WELL, HE OUGHT TO BE TAKEN OUT
AND HORSEWHIPPED!
YES, SIR,
THOROUGHLY HORSEWHIPPED!
WELL, HERE WE ARE.
EVERYTHING SECURE
IN THE GNOME DEPARTMENT?
OH, PLEASE KEEP DOWN,
KNOBBY!
YOU DON'T WANT THE OTHER
DOO-DEENS TO SEE YOU!
PACKED US IN HERE LIKE WE
WAS A COUPLE OF SANDWICHES,
AND ME AT MY AGE!
I'LL TAKE THIS.

HANDLED CASES LIKE THIS BEFORE?
ONE AFTER ANOTHER.

AS FAR AS CEDAR CREEK.
THAT'S WHERE
THEY WERE KIDNAPPED.
WHERE THEY DISAPPEARED --
I SAID KIDNAPPED,
AND I MEAN KIDNAPPED!
YES, YES, YES...
DURING THE TRIP,
DID ANYBODY SEE THEM
BESIDES YOU
AND YOUR GRANDCHILDREN?
SOMEONE ELSE
HAD TO SEE THEM, OF COURSE,
OR HOW WOULD THEY
HAVE GOTTEN KIDNAPPED?!
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
AND THAT'S ONE THAT YOU
HAVE TO FIND THE ANSWER TO!
EVERYTHING YOU SAID THUS FAR
LEADS ME TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU DID SEE GNOMES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'M DOING HERE?!
BUT NOT WITH THESE EYES --
WITH THOSE UP HERE.
THAT IS WHERE
ALL THE LITTLE PEOPLE --

Yes.
Yes, I think I can start painting in the morning.
I think you're one of the most selfish men I've ever met.
Dedicated.
Are you going to marry me?
I've told you. Yes.
As soon as I've got rid of a few debts and some money in the bank.
- Bruno.
- Oh, now, for heaven's sake.
- We can't wait any longer, Bruno.
- Why not?
Because I...
Well, tell me, tell me.
Oh, come on now, it's not as bad as all that.
- Just tell me why you have to get ma...
- I just do.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on now, what's happening to you?
Tell me.
I'm going to have your baby.
That's what's happened.
When did you know?
A week ago.
- Where are you going?
- To see your father.
- Why?
- I'm not going to evade my obligations.
I want him to know that.
Your obligations?
Yes, I'm afraid that's how he'll look at it.
Bruno!
Don't go to him, Bruno.
Bruno, wait.
- Well?
- He'll kill you if you go to him.
I doubt it.
Oh, Bruno!
Bruno!
What is it, Carla?
They're bringing the body in now, Doctor.
- I want it in here.
- Very well.
And Inspector Kanof is waiting to see you.
Thank you.
Well?
The girl is the daughter of Janus Cass, landlord of the Saracen Inn.
This may not be the same as the others.
- You mean you hope it isn't.
- Naturally.
Seven unsolved murders in five years is hardly good for my prestige here in Vandorf.
You think the young man did it?
Lovers sometimes quarrel.
He's still missing.
The young man's name is Bruno Heitz.
He comes to Vandorf every year, and rents the old mill house by the forest.
He's an artist, son of Professor Jules Heitz at Berlin University.
- Doctor of Literature.
- I know him.
We were students together.
- You'll be getting in touch with him?
- Immediately, Doctor.
I suggest not immediately.
Wait until they find the young man.
As you say, Doctor.
Thank you, Ratoff.
Wait here.
Madam.
Ratoff.
- How did this happen?
- She pounced on me, Doctor.
- As soon as I got through the door of her cell.
- This is the second time.
- Put her in a straitjacket, and keep her in it.
- Right.
- Sister, get those cuts attended to.
- Yes, Doctor.
What's the matter?
Doctor, you'll perform an autopsy?
On a body that's turned to stone?
Inspector.
Listen.
They've picked up the scent.
We're getting too close to the castle for my liking.
- Afraid?
- Yes, I am. I don't mind admitting it.
There are 20 men within a radius of a quarter of a mile.
You've got a gun, use it if you have to.
But remember, I want the boy taken alive.
Continue, Inspector.
When I broke the news of the girl's death to her father, he said it was no surprise to him.
What did you deduce from that?
That he knew of Bruno Heitz's bad reputation.
Which you, personally, had experienced?
Yes, sir. There were certain incidents.
- Describe them, please.
- Drunkenness.
- Bad behaviour in public.
- Thank you.
- Call Janus Cass.
- Janus Cass.
Mr Cass, you are the father of the deceased girl, Sascha?
Yes, sir.
- And the landlord of the Saracen Inn?
- Yes, sir.
Would you please tell the court what you know of the relationship between your daughter and this young man?
My girl loved him, unfortunately.
He took advantage of her and didn't want to face the consequences.
When you say "took advantage of her", do you mean she was pregnant by him?
Yes, sir. He was a thoroughly bad lot.
I told Sascha to have nothing to do with him.
- But she disobeyed you.
- I'm afraid so.
Did you personally observe this man's addiction to alcohol?
Well, sir, he came frequently to the Saracen Inn.
And in his cups, a tendency to violence?
- Well, sir, I...
- Thank you, Mr Cass.
You may stand down.
- Call Dr. Namaroff.
- Dr. Namaroff.
Now, Doctor, will you tell us what, in your opinion, was the cause of this girl's death?
Her death was undoubtedly the result of violence.
I observed deep abrasions around the forehead, and there were indentations in the skull, which may have been caused by some metal instrument.
Thank you, Doctor.
Call Professor Heitz.
Professor Heitz.
You are Professor Jules Heitz,
- father of the deceased man, Bruno Heitz?
- I am.
- You've heard the evidence before this court?
- I have.
- Did you know the girl?
- No, sir.
From the evidence I've heard,
I have the impression that your son was somewhat of a bohemian.
- Would you agree with that?
- He was a talented artist.
His life was of his own choosing.
I also have the impression he was a libertine.
No.
He had a number of girlfriends.
Possibly. However, that does not make him a libertine.
And one girlfriend in particular whom he betrayed?
I cannot believe that.
You are his father.
- Have you anything you wish to add?
- Yes.
I read the newspapers, and I am also a student of human nature.
I have read about the unsolved Vandorf murders.
I have also listened to the evidence and opinions given in this court.
In my opinion, everything I have heard has been generated by fear.
Proceed.
Evidence so obviously circumstantial, prejudiced and contrived, making one innocent man a scapegoat.
So obviously, indeed, that I can forecast your verdict now:
Murder and suicide.
My son's innocence stained to bring this witch-hunt to a smug and satisfactory close.
That is all I have to say, Mr Coroner.
But, believe me,
I shall not rest until I have cleared my son's good name.
If you have finished, you may stand down.
I find that the dead woman was murdered by her fiancé, Bruno Heitz, who then, in a fit of remorse took his own life.
Court is adjourned.
There have been seven murders committed in the forest of Vandorf in the past five years.
Every victim bore the same marks.
Each body turned to stone.
Why didn't you speak of this at the inquest?
Why is everyone in Vandorf trying to evade the truth?
- Including you?
- Carla.
I expected Kanof to make a scapegoat of that poor innocent boy, but not you.
Why are you so certain he's innocent?
Because she has come back.
She's here.
Somewhere.
In this hospital. I know it.
Come in.
Professor Heitz would like to see you, sir.
Show him in.
Professor, this is my assistant,
Miss Carla Hoffman.
How do you do?
That'll be all, Miss Hoffman.
I shan't need you any more today.
I'm so very sorry about your son, Professor.
You have my deepest sympathy.
- Thank you.
- Do sit down.
No, thank you.
I want to ask you a simple question.
Please.
You were once a guest at my house in Berlin.
You met both my sons, Bruno in particular.
- You talked to him at some length.
- I believe I did.
What impression did you form of him?
Well, I thought he was...
Normal?
Why, yes, of course.
Yet capable of murder?
My dear Heitz, that is hardly a fair question.
Given a certain set of circumstances,
I believe almost everybody is capable of murder.
Naturally, you are prejudiced.
I have been in Vandorf exactly two days.
I have asked questions and received evasion.
I have called at police headquarters and been refused admittance.
Everywhere I go
I find a conspiracy of silence.
Oh, I'm sure you exaggerate.
Oh no, there's an explanation somewhere.
It lies in the past.
Some horrible occurrence, which has been suppressed.
To the people of Vandorf, this thing, whatever it is, is real.
Something they cannot mention, because they dare not.
They want to believe that it doesn't exist, because the very admission of its existence only increases their fear.
That's why my son was branded a murderer.
He at least was human, tangible.
Doctor,
I need your help.
I can add nothing to what I said in court.
Let me ask you one more question.
Have you ever heard of Megaera?
- Megaera?
- She was one of three sisters.
They were known as Gorgons.
Two of them were slain.
According to the legend, the third, Megaera, fled to these parts.
It's said that when mortals looked upon her face, they were turned to stone.
That legend is 2,000 years old.
So I believe.
We are men of science.
I don't believe in ghosts or evil spirits, and I don't think you do either.
That's one of the most unscientific remarks I have ever heard.
I believe in the existence of everything which the human brain is unable to disprove.
Or prove?
That is why I'm remaining in Vandorf.
At least I intend to prove that my son was not a murderer.
One moment.
A word of advice.
What is it?
Leave Vandorf before it's too late.
What is it you're afraid of?
- I'm afraid for you.
- Or of what I may discover if I remain?
Let's get to the house!
Come on, let's get him out!
Get out of Vandorf, Heitz!
- Go home, Heitz.
- Sir, don't you think we should...
We want you out of this house, mister, now.
Get out of my house, all of you.
Oh, so that's how it is.
Police!
Come on.
I hope you're not too badly hurt.
No.
If there is a repetition of this,
Inspector, I shall hold you responsible.
I'm sorry. My police force is very small.
We have other duties besides giving protection to unwelcome visitors.
Your business here is over. Why don't you go?
My business is not over.
Very well.
I've warned you.
That's the best I can do.
If you should change your mind, Professor,
I'll see you have safe conduct to the station.
I want you to send a telegram to Professor Meister at Leipzig University.
Come in.
Oh, Paul, this telegram has just arrived.
It's from your father. He wants you to go to Vandorf immediately.
This is the first I've heard of my father since Bruno was reported missing.
You'd better go, hadn't you?
There's a train that leaves at nine in the morning, I believe it is.
Yes, sir.
Hope you find everything all right.
Let me know if you want any help.
Oh, and give my regards to your father, won't you?
Yes, thank you, sir. Yes, I will.
Hans!
Hans!
- What's happened, sir?
- For God's sake, don't come nearer.
Your face.
Listen carefully.
I haven't much time, Hans.
I have to write a letter to my son, Paul.
He should be here tomorrow.
In the morning, take the letter and give it to him.
No one else must see it but Paul.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.
Leave me now.
There is nothing you can do.
Goodbye, Hans.
Yes, you may see a copy of the death certificate if you wish.
But as far as the body is concerned, that is entirely up to the police.
They have refused permission for me to see the body.
- Why?
- This is a police state, Mr Heitz.
They don't have to give reasons.
- Doctor, did you examine the body?
- Of course.
And in your opinion, there was no doubt as to the cause of death? Heart failure?
No doubt whatsoever.
Then how do you account for this?
"I am agonised by pains in my chest.
I am turning to stone."
- May I see that letter?
- I'm sorry.
My father gave instructions that I was to show it to no one.
- I see.
- He knew he was dying when he started to write.
He was able to write three pages.
Now that doesn't sound like heart failure.
You don't go on working through a heart attack.
You know that as well as I.
He refers to "this terrible thing
"stalking amongst the people of Vandorf.
"It turned Sascha to stone and others before her,
"The conspiracy of silence and the fear."
And he mentions "Megaera".
Does the name mean anything to you,
Dr. Namaroff?
You're not suggesting there's any connection between a character from mythology and your father's death?
When he wrote this letter, he knew what was happening to him.
He knew how he was dying and why.
It wasn't heart failure.
That is your opinion.
No doubt you'll have an opportunity to express it at the inquest.
When will it be held?
I don't know.
But I'll see that you're informed.
Goodbye, Mr Heitz.
Please forgive me for intruding.
The door was open.
Who are you?
I'm Carla Hoffman.
Dr. Namaroff's assistant at the hospital.
You are Paul Heitz.
Can I help you?
I would like to help you if I can.
Does Namaroff know you're here?
He'd be very angry if he did.
Oh, please believe me,
I only came here to see if I can help you.
This afternoon, you spoke to Dr. Namaroff?
- You spoke about Megaera?
- Yes.
Did Dr. Namaroff tell you that the spirit of Megaera roams this forest and it has also been known to enter this house?
No, he didn't.
For the simple reason that he doesn't believe in it. Or says he doesn't.
- But you do.
- I don't know.
I only know that something very terrible is happening here in Vandorf.
Megaera does exist, Mr Heitz.
- Have you seen her?
- No one has seen her and lived.
Do you really think that
Namaroff believes in her?
- I know he does.
- Well, then why doesn't he admit it?
Because he's like all the rest.
He tries to deny the existence of something he cannot explain.
Megaera is inexplicable and terrifying.
But you must believe in her.
If you don't, you'll see no reason to leave here.
And one day, you'll...
You'll be found like all the others.
Well, thank you for warning me.
But I have to find out things for myself.
I can't leave.
In less than one week,
I've lost my brother and my father.
I'm not really very concerned about what happens to me.
I am concerned.
Thank you.
I'm very grateful to you.
I must go now. I'm on duty in half an hour.
Goodbye.
I hope we'll meet again.
"Herbert Spencer once said that every legend and myth known to mankind
"is not entirely without its authentic foundation.
"Presupposing he is right,
"we must go to the very source of this legend,
"to a time over 2,000 years ago, to Ancient Greece."
There were three hideous monsters.
Sisters.
They were called Gorgons.
Their names were Tisiphone,
Medusa and Megaera.
Their heads were crowned with living snakes, and each snake was a tentacle of the hellish brain from which it sprang.
So hideous was the Gorgon, that anyone who looked upon her was petrified.
The proper word is "gorgonised" which literally means "turned to stone".
Go on.
I'm sorry.
He came in just then.
That's all I had time to memorise.
I want you to trust me, Carla.
Why is this letter so important?
Because Professor Heitz was a great student of mythology, and, had he lived, he could have provided a complete answer.
I had hoped to find it in that letter.
Has it helped you at all?
A little.
I can tell you that...
That devil. She's out.
Look for her. Don't come back till you've found her.
- If I do find her, I'll kill her.
- Ratoff!
You'll bring her back alive.
I was about to tell you that Megaera has taken on human form.
Human?
Don't try to talk.
Everything's all right.
Ratoff.
- Where is Dr. Namaroff?
- He's in the laboratory.
Would you ask him to come here, please?
Miss Hoffman would like you to go to Mr Heitz's ward.
Very well.
Ratoff.
Yes, sir?
You said she was not quite dead when you found her?
Not quite.
She had enough strength left to spit in my face.
And then she died.
Thank you.
What happened to me?
Miss Hoffman had some sort of presentiment that something was going to happen to you.
We found you lying beside the pool in your garden.
How long have I been here?
Five days.
- Five...
- Lie still.
Can you remember what happened before you fell?
Fell?
Don't you remember?
I remember...
I remember seeing something reflected in the pool.
What was it?
A face.
It was horrible.
It was the most horrible thing
I've ever seen.
You must rest now.
I'll talk to you again in a day or two.
- In a day or two?
- You're in a very weak condition.
I don't want you to overtax your strength.
For pity's sake, I must know about this...
This thing!
- Whatever it was.
- I'm speaking to you as a doctor.
You're suffering from shock.
It's essential that you should rest.
I tell you I'm all right. Please.
I've got to know.
I want you to look at yourself.
Now please do as I tell you.
It's all right. It's all right.
She was here. She came into the room. I saw her.
You were dreaming.
No one's been here, I promise you.
She was leaning over me. I could see the snakes' heads lunging forward.
I tell you, she was here.
It was a dream. It was only a dream.
Try and rest.
Try and rest.
Mr Heitz is ready to leave.
He'd like to see you before he goes.
Ask him to come in.
Mr Heitz.
Sit down, Mr Heitz.
I understand that the inquest on my father was held a week ago.
Yes. He was buried the day after you were taken ill.
Miss Hoffman took the liberty of sending a wreath on your behalf.
I'm very grateful to her.
You'll be leaving for Leipzig now?
No.
- Are you staying in Vandorf?
- I'm going back to the house.
Doctor, I think you would like to unravel this mystery as much as I.
- Why can't we work together?
- I don't understand you. What mystery?
Oh, for Heaven's sake! Don't treat me like one of your neurotic patients.
You know perfectly well what I'm talking about.
I'm afraid I don't.
- Good day, Mr Heitz. Good day.
- But, Doctor...
You're afraid of her like the rest of them, aren't you?
Well, I intend to find this creature.
- Indeed?
- And destroy it.
Come to my office, will you?
- Yes, sir?
- There's a full moon tonight.
Don't let her out of your sight.
I feel I have the right to ask you a question.
What is it?
Is she in danger?
She may be close to death.
Somehow I knew you'd be here.
Why did Namaroff issue a false death certificate?
Who is he trying to shield?
I know it's almost beyond belief, but there's the evidence in that coffin.
A man who looked on her face and was turned to stone.
Herbert Spencer once said that every legend and myth known to mankind is not without its authentic foundation.
You've read my father's letter.
Yes.
I lied to you.
Dr. Namaroff wanted that letter.
I memorised part of it.
Why did he want it?
He was hoping it would throw a new light on Megaera.
Please don't hate me for this.
Why? Why are you telling me this now?
I'm afraid.
- Of Namaroff?
- Yes.
In a way.
But why?
Well, go on. Tell me.
You asked me just now who he's trying to shield.
I don't know.
He won't tell me.
Is Namaroff in love with you?
And jealous?
Yes.
Then why don't you leave him?
I wish I could.
Carla?
I'll take you away with me now.
- Paul, I can't leave.
- Please don't be afraid.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- Then leave Namaroff.
- I can't, Paul. I just can't.
- But why, if you love me? Why not?
- I don't know.
- I don't know why.
- Carla.
Paul.
Please, don't ask me again.
Well, do you propose to keep me standing out here all night?
Professor Meister.
Oh, I can't tell you how glad I am to see you.
Good heavens, Paul.
What's happened to you?
Well, I've been ill.
Ill?
You look as if you've been in your grave and dug your way out.
- Where have you been?
- Here, in Vandorf.
I hadn't seen you for some considerable time, so I thought I'd come and see what you'd been doing.
It's a long story.
I've come a long way to hear it.
Could I offer you some refreshment? Coffee?
No, nothing like that, thank you.
I ate on the train.
Now, tell me your story.
Were you out tonight, Carla?
Yes.
Where did you go?
For a walk.
Were you alone?
Yes.
It isn't a pretty sight.
It never ceases to amaze me why the most noble work of God, the human brain, is the most revolting to the human eye.
Do you remember when we found Paul Heitz?
I do.
It was the night Martha escaped, and you told me that Megaera had taken on human form.
Well?
Was it Martha?
No, Carla, it wasn't Martha.
You suspect somebody.
It's too early to say.
We work so closely together.
I have a right to know.
Please tell me.
Not until I'm sure.
Good night, Carla.
So you only saw her reflection?
It was enough.
When Perseus beheaded Medusa, he guided his blow by looking at her reflection in the shield that he carried.
If your story is true, the girl, Sascha, must have looked directly at the
Gorgon and so did your father.
What spared you is the fact that you only saw her reflection.
- This much we know.
- Then you believe me?
I'm not saying that Megaera exists.
Unquestionably, you saw something.
Hallucination or not, it was certainly real enough to you.
- She was not a hallucination.
- No, of course not.
Oh, Professor, please don't try to humour me.
Is the idea of Megaera any stranger than the theory of reincarnation, which admits to a dead person's spirit inhabiting a human body?
Probably not, Paul, but that particular theory has yet to be proved.
- Do you believe it?
- I neither believe it nor disbelieve it.
Now, as to your own story, let us start with the assumption that Megaera, in some form or another, has indeed returned.
Have you met many people since you've been here?
Very few.
Any women?
- Only the one I told you about.
- Oh, yes, Carla. Carla...
Hoffman.
What's she like?
Very beautiful.
I see.
You're in love with her?
- I didn't say so.
- You didn't have to.
I'll have that drink you offered me now.
Under no circumstances will I permit such a thing. There is no precedent.
Don't use long words, Inspector.
They don't suit you.
If you don't wish to be of assistance, that's entirely your affair. I'll go higher up.
- Higher up?
- I presume that even you, Inspector, acknowledge the existence of a superior?
- How dare you?
- The Foreign Secretary, for example.
- I would like to point out...
- A friend of my dear brother.
But don't bother about it, Inspector.
I'll go and see him myself.
- It will not...
- Yes, you were saying?
It will not be necessary, Professor.
It was just that your request startled me for a moment, but no doubt you have a very good reason.
Now, let me see. You wish to inspect the photographs and records...
Of all the women aliens registered here within the last ten years.
Well, I'll go and get the files.
Visitors to Vandorf are only required to register if they wish later to become citizens.
This is, of course, a very democratic state.
That's a lovely girl, Professor.
This look like her?
- It hardly does her justice, but...
- It looks like her.
How long has she been here?
Well, the information is on the back.
Seven years.
- When did these murders start?
- Murders?
The ones which you failed to solve, and which your democratic state so carefully concealed, Inspector.
When did they start?
- Approximately...
- Not approximately. Exactly.
Five years ago.
Thank you.
Oh, incidentally, I understand some of your democratic citizens tried to eject the late Professor Heitz.
You'd better warn them not to attempt that sort of behaviour with me. Good day.
Dr. Namaroff.
- What is it?
- Mr Heitz is on the telephone.
He wants to make an appointment to see you with Professor Meister.
- Meister?
- From Leipzig University.
I can't see them. Tell them I'm busy.
Mr Heitz was very insistent.
Carla, please.
Do as I say.
Carla.
When you went for your walk last night, you said you were alone.
You lied to me.
Do I have to account to you for everything I do?
You were with Paul Heitz, weren't you?
- Why don't you ask Ratoff?
- I'm asking you.
I am tired of being treated like a criminal.
Why does Ratoff follow me everywhere I go?
Why are you spying on me?
I'm trying to protect you.
I don't believe you.
I've told you before. There are times when you shouldn't be alone.
Tell me about those times.
Tell me what happens to me.
I can't yet.
- Because it's all an invention.
- No.
- You're trying to frighten me.
- I only want to take care of you.
Frighten me, so that I'll submit to being treated like a prisoner.
I've had enough.
I am sick of your jealousy.
I am sick of you.
Paul?
I'm sorry, Dr. Namaroff won't see you.
- Well, why not?
- He says he's too busy.
Paul, meet me tomorrow morning at the Castle Borski at seven o'clock.
Hello?
Hello, Carla?
Well?
Namaroff refuses to see us.
Paul.
Why did you want to come here?
They're less likely to follow me.
No one dares come near the Castle Borski.
When was it last inhabited?
Fifty years ago.
Except for her.
Her?
Megaera.
Why did you want to see me so urgently?
Have you changed your mind?
Oh, yes, Paul.
I will come away with you.
You will?
I don't feel chained to Vandorf any more.
I'm not afraid any longer.
I'll go with you, Paul, but it must be now.
Not immediately, Carla.
- Why?
- Professor Meister is trying to help me.
Do what?
Find Megaera.
Oh, Paul. Oh, Paul, don't stay.
If you love me, take me away from here while there's still time.
- Just as soon as I can. I promise you.
- Now, Paul, now.
It won't be long, Carla.
It'll be too late.
I must go.
I may never see you again.
Carla.
Oh, Paul.
Carla. Carla, listen to me.
Paul.
Did you recognise him?
It was Ratoff.
One of the attendants at the hospital.
Perhaps in future, you'd be good enough to tell me where you're going.
- But why did Ratoff try to kill me?
- I suggest you ask Dr. Namaroff that.
Carla?
Ratoff, have you seen Carla?
Went to her room.
"Carla Hoffman.
"Probationary nurse here in 1903.
"In 1905, believed to be suffering from loss of memory."
In other words, amnesia.
That was five years ago.
"In 1906, underwent intensive treatment and was apparently cured.
"Meanwhile, continued to work in her profession."
Now, let's put some of these pieces together.
The first of the Vandorf murders coincided with these attacks of amnesia.
A condition of which Namaroff was well aware.
Ordinarily, this would have put an end to her career as a nurse, but Namaroff, as you've told me, is in love with her.
- For heaven's sake.
- Just a minute.
In 1906, Namaroff closed the case and stated that she was cured.
But was she cured?
- I don't think so.
- For what possible reason...
Just a moment. I'm coming to that.
She told you that she was being watched.
- Because Namaroff is jealous.
- Possibly.
And possibly also because she still loses her memory around the time of the full moon.
How do you know that?
It's all here, Paul. All the dates, when the amnesia occurred and reoccurred.
Then you seriously believe it?
- You seriously suspect that Carla is...
- Why shouldn't I?
- I'm not in love with her.
- Oh, you're mad.
A young girl as beautiful as Carla?
I'm not making any physical comparisons, Paul, between her and Megaera.
Megaera died 2,000 years ago.
It's her spirit we're concerned with today.
It's found a resting place in somebody.
- Not Carla.
- In the cemetery, you begged her to go away. She refused. Why?
She was not ready to leave.
She couldn't leave, Paul.
It was the full moon.
The spirit of Megaera was too strong.
And then, today, she asked you to take her away.
- Didn't she? Immediately.
- She was frightened of Namaroff.
- Did she say so?
- Yes.
I'll tell you why she was frightened, Paul.
Because tonight is the first night of the full moon.
Oh, this is guesswork.
It's monstrous, circumstantial, utterly without reason.
I should've taken her away. I only stayed because I thought you needed me.
I do need you, Paul.
Oh, no, not after this.
All you need is somebody to agree with you.
And what are you trying to do to me? To Carla? Destroy us?
Paul!
Paul!
I had to see you again.
It's all right. We're going away today.
It's too late.
Why?
Why is it too late?
I don't know.
I could have gone yesterday.
But now I just can't go.
It seems we have visitors.
You had better take her upstairs.
Come on.
I wish to see Mr Heitz.
Will you tell him, please?
- I take it that you are Dr. Namaroff?
- I am.
Come in.
My name is Meister, Karl Meister.
I've been looking forward to meeting you, Doctor.
I'd like to make this brief, if you don't mind.
In the early hours of this morning, a young woman was seen in the grounds of this house.
Indeed.
I have reason to believe she is here now.
Is she a patient of yours, Doctor?
I am responsible for her.
Yes. Yes, of course, an amnesia victim is a great responsibility.
What did you say?
One never really knows what they're capable of, does one?
They might even commit murder during one of their lapses.
And no one would be any the wiser.
Where is Carla?
She is not here.
You're lying.
Search the house.
I warn you not to obstruct the law.
I have a search warrant.
Mr Heitz, if she's not found,
I shall charge you with her abduction.
On what grounds?
I can produce the evidence.
Speaking of evidence, Dr. Namaroff, perhaps you'd be good enough to return this to Mr Ratoff with my compliments.
He left it behind him when he attempted to kill Mr Heitz yesterday.
- What are you insinuating?
- I'm not insinuating anything, Doctor.
You sent Ratoff to follow Carla to the Castle Borski, where she met Paul.
When she left, Ratoff attempted to kill Paul with this knife.
Why do you want Paul out of the way, Namaroff?
Is it because you're afraid he'll take Carla away from you?
Or because you think he'll find out the secret that you share with Ratoff?
Answer me.
How dare you?
Take your hands off me.
Professor Meister.
If you don't release the doctor this instant, I won't hesitate to shoot.
- Well?
- She's not in the house.
- Have you looked in every room?
- Everywhere.
- The attic. Have you searched the attic?
- She's not there.
Where is she, Paul?
I told them the truth.
Where has she gone?
In about an hour's time, there's a train for Leipzig.
She will be on it.
You arranged for somewhere for her to stay in Leipzig, Paul?
She will be at the Hotel Kramer.
And you will be joining her there?
When we've found Megaera.
You should have gone with her.
I was very tempted.
Well, why didn't you?
You came here because of me.
When we've found Megaera, then I shall join Carla in Leipzig.
I shouldn't depend on that, Paul.
She won't reach Leipzig.
She won't even be on the train.
Are you persisting in this preposterous theory?
If they find her before she reaches the station, I shall have proved nothing.
If, however, she does reach the station, she will be in Leipzig this evening at five o'clock.
In which case, I suggest you telephone the Hotel Kramer about five thirty.
Come in.
- Any news?
- No, sir.
- Police will be giving up in an hour.
- Giving up?
They won't search after dark.
It's a full moon, Dr. Namaroff.
The second night of the full moon.
You haven't forgotten it's the night Megaera usually strikes?
Get out.
Carla.
Carla.
You're quite sure?
Yes, thank you.
She hasn't arrived.
They must've caught her before she got to the station.
I doubt it. I hope for your sake, Paul, that
I'm wrong, but we're looking for the truth.
The fact that she hasn't arrived proves nothing.
Nothing at all. But do we discard my theory because it upsets your scheme of things?
Or do we go on looking for the truth?
She's out there somewhere. I'm going to look.
Wait, Paul. In an hour's time, it'll be dark. Wait until the morning.
Paul. Paul, you won't find Carla.
Get out of my way.
I am sorry, Paul, but I can't let you destroy yourself.
What the devil do you want?
I have a warrant for the arrest of Paul Heitz.
- On what charge?
- The abduction of Carla Hoffman.
Oh, that's ridiculous. You saw for yourself that she wasn't in the house.
Will you please inform Mr Heitz?
I'll give him five minutes to get dressed.
He's not there.
- Well, where is he?
- I haven't the slightest idea, Inspector.
Professor, you will accompany me to the police station.
- I shall do no such thing.
- Bring him along.
Carla?
Carla!
I am waiting for Carla, Mr Heitz.
Carla.
She's free now, Paul.
She's free.
Lieutenant!
Good morning.
Boy, with a good-looking nurse like that on board, I wouldn't mind running a fever.
Just remember, sailor,
I've got lots of castor oil in sickbay.
And you, too.
Yes, sir... Ma'am.
Lieutenant!
Thanks.
Oh, a gorilla.
Are we going to make surveys of animals on this trip, too, Commander?
No, this is just for our own amusement.
This has nothing to do with our report to the UN.
Well, I don't see how you can be amused by gorillas.
I think they're dull.
Well, this one is 60 feet tall.
What do you think of him?
Sixty feet?
That's right. This is Kong.
The strongest living creature on earth.
Oh, yes, I remember.
A legend.
And yet, underlying that old legend is some truth.
Are you saying that Kong is not just fictional?
Yes, I'll show you.
I've devoted a good many years to research on Kong.
Data I've obtained... shows that a giant anthropoid had lived on an island in this area.
It still may be there.
It may. See this picture?
Right here.
These are steps from some ancient stone ruins.
I thought so, too, when I first saw it.
But those steps are each 10 feet high.
No human can climb that high in one step.
What do you think, Commander?
What I'm trying to figure out is... who built it?
And for what purpose?
Do the islanders really think this was done by a giant ape?
The natives of the Java Sea most definitely believe in Kong.
And, Susan, look at this tunnel.
This is also Kong's work.
Which island is it?
The island is Mondo.
Right there.
Just a little way off our course.
Cdr. Nelson, take us there for a look.
Sorry, we have no time to spare.
We're here to seek oil, you know.
We have our orders from the United Nations Research Council.
I wish there were some way, but...
He's exactly like the original Kong.
With this, the world is ours.
It's still not the original.
- You sure you just didn't build a giant toy?
- A toy?
That's an insult.
How can you say that?
It is the strongest thing there is in the world today.
Need I remind you how I feel about that?
How does it help my government get Element X?
This robot can do anything I program.
You can see that I had it constructed exactly as Carl Nelson planned it.
This man, Nelson, is interesting.
Will you get on to the point?
Most certainly.
The giant Kong was Nelson's model.
This famous scientist researched the legend... and he reconstructed the strongest creature on earth.
You stole it.
Mmm-hmm.
I took his drawings... and my genius translated them into a robot Kong... that can certainly do anything the original Kong would have done.
That ego is showing again.
Remember, my country buys results.
Doctor, we do not underwrite your precious ego.
I quite understand.
I shall soon let my Kong show you that he can certainly do the job.
Obtain Element X, Dr. Who, and you succeed.
My government insists you succeed.
You understand that?
I do, Madame.
We are all ready to start.
You'll observe my creation doing now what's never been done.
We'll go outside.
Forty-two thousand.
Mark!
The rays of Element X are strong.
You are aware the entire world has unearthed... the total of only three ounces of this rare element.
No one could mine, until now, this crater.
Down there is a deposit of tons.
My robot Kong is in position.
After all these years of labor, success has come.
He will bring out
10,000 tons of X, this robot.
We are ready, Doctor.
Test results?
Excellent, sir.
Shortly, your country is going to gain nuclear domination of the universe.
America and the Soviets can never catch up.
Shouldn't we count on this taking years, Doctor?
A hundred days, Madame.
That soon?
Element X is unparalleled.
You'll create a nuclear arsenal fast.
I predict you'll rule the entire world in time.
This is an historic day.
It's quite a treasure you turned up at the North Pole, huh?
Shall we get under way?
All right, you may start.
Right.
That robot is extraordinary.
The real Kong couldn't do what it can.
What's happened?
It's nearly there now.
You did that?
No, sir!
Get out.
What's wrong?
The magnetic mass has destroyed his circuits.
We will start again.
I want you to redesign this circuitry and shield it.
You are to work day and night.
We shall start right now.
Where are you going, Madame?
Don't you know, Doctor?
Don't desert us now.
It's only going to take us a short while longer.
Do what you want to. Our country is withdrawing all aid, Doctor.
You can't do this.
I must ask that you reconsider.
You force me to delay the new construction, and the source of Element X is mine.
Only I can take it.
What if another country gets it, not yours?
Should I take that as a threat?
Your country already has a huge stake in the robot.
I don't suggest you quit.
All right, I'll request that we grant you the extra time you want.
Dr. Who,
I should mention this: more of your blundering, and you're through.
Control Guard.
Control!
Turn it off!
Hey, get him out. Hurry!
Come on, give me your hand.
Up you go. Come on.
Secure the engine.
All stations, report your damage.
How does it look down there?
Hey, something's wrong with the rudder.
Water pipe on the port side broken.
- What happened?
- Rockslide down the canyon wall, sir.
Commander, we should take a look at the rudder.
All right.
Surface for repairs.
Control!
Aye, aye, sir.
Surface, 15 degrees.
We'll have to check the nuclear reactors.
Sir, we're getting the repairs under way.
Thanks.
That rockslide was made to order.
There's a perfect bay for anchoring on that island.
Let's take advantage of it while the ship is being repaired.
You're hurt.
Why didn't you come for treatment right away?
- It's nothing.
- I wish you would do as you're told.
First chance I get to do my job as a nurse, and you...
Oh, my.
What are you laughing at, sir?
I can't help it.
You've got your wish, and I'll get mine.
We'll be landing on Mondo Island.
That's funny.
There are no villagers here this time.
Was the island inhabited?
Do you understand?
Yes. It's a Javanese dialect.
He's warning us not to enter.
He says that it's taboo, and that it must not be broken.
Kong?
Wong. That means, "king."
The natives call him King Kong.
He says we're trespassing on Kong's home.
Do you mean he actually exists?
We'll soon find out.
Let's get hold of the old one and see what else we can learn.
- Susan, you'd better wait here.
- Alone?
You're safer here.
Watch yourself.
This way.
Over there.
No, don't shoot. Wait.
Kong!
Look.
Put me down, Kong.
Put me down!
Down!
Kong, put me down!
Please, Kong. Down.
Susan!
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait. We can't leave him like this.
It's our only chance.
Now come on.
Hurry. We're lost if he catches us this time.
Look, starboard.
He jammed the controls.
Look, there's Kong.
I think we stabilized it.
Hang on. Here we go.
Take the controls.
Stop firing!
Stop firing!
Hold it, men.
This is your commander.
We're coming aboard.
Give the order to dive.
Prepare to dive.
Rig to dive.
All right, sir?
Yes.
Stand by for emergency dive.
We can't, sir.
The rudder's not working yet.
Well, then, we'll just have to make...
Hey!
How are you doing?
Are you through?
Not yet, sir.
- How much longer?
- Should be about 10 minutes more.
That long?
All right. Hurry.
I don't think he means to sink the ship.
Is he playing a game with us?
No.
I don't think he is.
What do you intend to do?
He wants us to get out there, so I'll go out and quiet him down.
Commander, I'll go out.
I won't let you.
Kong let me go when he had me in the palm of his hand.
Commander, let me go, please.
He wants me.
Is there any other way?
All right.
See if you can win some time for us.
We've got to get out of this inlet.
Make preparations to dive.
Make emergency repairs.
Aye, sir.
Susan.
You okay?
Take care.
Kong, please!
Don't shake the ship.
I sleep and I eat on this ship.
Engine rooms, A-okay.
You'd better stand watch outside.
When we're ready to dive, call Susan in.
Put me down. Please!
No. No, Kong.
Take me back.
Take me back to the ship, Kong.
Let's go to the ship. Please.
I don't want to go with you.
Thank you, Kong.
Susan, we're all ready.
Goodbye, Kong.
You gave us quite a scare out there.
Your attention, please.
We're dropping everything and heading directly for UN headquarters in New York.
Our report will create a sensation among the world's scientists.
And you'd better get out of those wet clothes.
Kong is back on shore.
This is Mondo Island, the home of Kong.
And in addition to Kong... there are mammoth reptiles living on the island... that have long since become extinct on other continents.
This island could be called a living museum of the prehistoric age.
This concludes my report.
Are there any questions?
At the meeting of the scientific committee this morning... it was decided to send the Explorer out again.
Is this for the purpose of capturing Kong?
No, not to capture him, but to study him in his natural habitat.
It would be, to say the least, difficult to care for him here in New York.
Will you be accompanied by the same crew?
Yes. Essentially the same crew will go on the expedition.
Especially Lt. Cdr. Nomura and Miss Watson, sitting here beside me.
They are very well-known to Kong.
Kong was apparently gentle with Lt. Watson. May I ask why?
Miss Watson, do you know a reason you can tell me?
It's very easy for us to understand.
You see, as ridiculous as it may sound...
Kong is a male and Miss Watson is...
Well, see for yourselves, gentlemen.
If there are no further questions...
I will now turn the meeting over to the Chairman of the Council.
Thank you very much for your kind attention.
Code signal, LCM3.
Go ahead.
My country is going to grant you more time.
Nelson sold you on the Kong, huh?
We can now use his Kong to do the digging for us.
The real Kong's a mammal.
Could he stand the radiation, Doctor?
Kong can resist it better than anything.
He cannot stand it forever, though.
We will only need the big beast a day or two, you know.
I think that, that will have to do.
I agree.
Now I shall go after him.
Can you get Kong to obey you?
You should consider that,
Doctor.
You should know that I do.
You should also know, we can't go on without your aid.
You can do this without additional aid.
You can control Kong as Nelson did.
A woman is the secret.
Susan Watson got Kong to do anything she asked.
Might I ask, what do we do with Watson and Nelson when we're through?
That is quite easy.
Merely a dirty detail.
I'll support you
30 days more.
How you do it is your concern.
I want you to succeed.
I should hate to hear that you had died.
Must proceed quickly.
The Explorer, with Nelson, will be here any day.
- Your copters should be ready right now.
- Yes, sir.
There he is.
- All right, get ready.
- Ready, sir.
Away.
That's good. Let's land.
Excellent.
Hook up to him.
Yes, yes. Kong's mine now.
Ready to go, sir.
That's good.
Prepare to land.
This proves Kong's still on the island.
Yeah, I think he's still here.
Had a recent rendezvous.
He must be near here someplace.
We don't want to excite him, so just the three of us will go on from here.
Aye, sir. Let's go.
Kong's opponents were human beings.
It smells like ether.
Lieutenant... have the men collect samples of these shell casings.
Then let's spread out and search for Kong.
We should be able to find him easily enough, if he's lying around someplace.
Okay, get going.
It looks like Kong escaped after putting up a terrific battle.
Yes. Still, I don't know.
Carl! Carl!
Here.
He's been shot.
Is there any chance?
What did he say?
He said that an Oriental skeleton... a devil with eyes like a gutter rat... kidnapped Kong and took him away into the skies.
- Lieutenant, see that he has a decent burial.
- Yes, sir.
Was he the only one here?
It looks that way.
Wish we could have talked to the old one sooner.
He told us enough.
I have an idea who the kidnapper is.
It must be my old friend... that international
Judas, Dr. Who.
Send this rush to New York.
Aye, aye.
"Proceed immediately to Station 6318, north.
"Start investigation at the nearest field office."
Right here. That's Tokyo.
It looks like an
Asiatic country is tied in.
A check in Tokyo will tell us where this came from.
I don't know.
Do you really think we can locate Kong?
Sure. We'll find him.
As long as they haven't taken him to the North Pole.
All right.
Come down.
Knock before you enter next time.
All right, state what it is you want.
New York, huh?
The UN has begun to ask a lot of questions about us.
The members of the UN Science Council already know this name.
Don't worry about them.
You sure you removed all evidence?
Yes. Worry not.
I can outwit the UN any day and anytime.
Did you see our giant ape?
My thought is that under ether he won't be much use.
You underrate what a genius I am.
I can control the ape.
Will he do as you order?
Hypnotic susceptibility.
That's the secret.
Hypnosis?
A creature with Kong's intelligence is easily handled.
That's another little thing
I learned through Carl Nelson.
Recall, Doctor. You agreed that you would get Carl Nelson's crew... so that they could handle
Kong, yes?
Nelson and his crew will be on their way soon.
This is their last trip.
They will aid us as needed, then we will just do away with them.
A Japanese aircraft
is calling the Commander.
I will connect you, sir.
Roger. Put him through. Over.
An emergency has arisen.
I have been sent
from the UN Field Office...
to transport you to Tokyo
as fast as possible.
Cdr. Nelson, Lt. Cdr. Nomura,
and Lt. Watson...
are requested to immediately collect
all pertinent evidence...
and transfer to this aircraft.
Over and out.
Right here.
What is this emergency situation?
The Kong has gone ashore at Hokkaido, sir.
Hokkaido?
Yes, early today.
We're under orders to take you and your crew there right away.
I don't trust the pilot.
And I don't think they're Japanese.
Release him.
Is it all right?
He'll do whatever I say.
Kong, you are to obey these orders.
Listen. Element X is in the crater.
You will go out there and dig it up.
That tunnel will take him right into our crater.
Let's hope that nothing goes wrong now.
Kong, you must dig faster.
Kong!
Continue.
Go ahead. Remember, you're to dig it up.
My Kong could never dig like that.
Kong, what's the matter?
You're slowing down.
Wake up!
Dig!
Kong, you must do
as I order. Dig.
Continue to dig. Kong!
Wake up.
You shall not sleep.
Wake up!
Dig!
Dig, Kong. Dig.
Can't you hear?
Go on, you idiot ape.
Kong. Kong, wake up.
I command you.
Dig, you dumb beast.
Out. Get away.
Let's go again.
Kong, once again. Dig!
The beast has escaped.
Close the tunnel, quick.
Right.
Just as I thought. Kong could very easily stand the radiation.
Unluckily, we couldn't maintain the power that we had.
- Now what?
- Sir, Nelson's in the laboratory.
Oh!
Carl Nelson is here now?
Aye.
They constructed a robot just like ours.
Looks like Dr. Who wasn't satisfied with a robot.
He wanted the real Kong.
Carl, glad you could come.
Nomura, you, too.
Been a long time.
Obviously, not enough years to suit me.
What is this all about?
Is Kong here?
Yes.
That's where he is usually kept.
What do you think of this Kong?
Do you recognize your brainchild?
You'd steal Niagara Falls for a drink of water.
But... you want the real Kong to do something the robot can't do.
Right?
I'm after X, Nelson.
Element X?
Mmm-hmm.
Under the ice here is all I want.
Only Kong's muscle can get it all out.
You know what we can get from him.
You can't use the robot, huh?
And Kong won't do what you want him to do.
- That's why you brought us here.
- You are so right.
You think we'll agree to help you?
I predicted you would not.
Will you, Lt. Watson?
I won't help you, either.
We shall see.
Come.
Well, this is great.
It's a pretty odd lab.
So this is Dr. Who's guest room.
With no color television.
At least we can joke a little.
Actually,
I'm awfully afraid.
We all are, Susan.
If Who manages to extract the Element X... there'll be no object in keeping us alive.
Nelson, you are to come.
Hello there.
Won't you sit down?
Would you like a drink?
Yeah. Why not?
You know,
I'm slightly confused.
You take your typical
Oriental Mata Hari, now...
What are you saying?
Let me put it this way.
If you'll excuse the corny cliché... what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
My answer is a corny cliché.
Did you ever hear it?
Don't judge a book according to its cover.
Or a snake, by its color.
That's well-put.
What's your connection with Dr. Who?
Business.
But you should know that I don't really want to go on in it.
Tell me one thing first.
Do you work for him, or does he work for you?
Does life here in the North interest you?
My dear, we can easily get all the world capitals.
London, Paris...
I can arrange it so this lab is yours.
Please stay here with me.
You can run the whole thing, Carl.
If the money holds out.
What if there's no country to buy Element X... once you mine it?
You don't have to be worried about that.
You're not Japanese. Chinese?
Thai? Vietnam? Burma?
You're getting warm, Carl.
Getting too warm.
All right.
He's a hard one to handle.
Nelson's an unusual man.
He is not the kind of man that you are used to.
That's why he appeals to me.
An idealist.
But I know how to make him do anything we want.
Susan. Look at it this way: it can only get better.
Because it certainly can't get any worse.
Carl, look.
Carl, may I see you outside?
What is it this time?
Torture?
It's been too long since we've had a game of chess together.
Your two friends are quite affectionate.
They could be happy, if you don't interfere.
Susan.
Now the cell temperature is zero.
You know they can't stand the bitter cold.
You know what will happen, unless you rescue them.
Only a little cooperation will do it.
Susan, here.
This will...
No, Jiro.
It's better this way.
If you'd just cooperate... those young people could be enjoying a little hot tea right now, Carl.
Kong will listen more to those two than to me.
Check.
Those walls are being turned into ice.
Why won't you save them?
Why should you endure this when it is not necessary?
Nelson cannot aid you any longer.
He's been cancelled.
You dog.
I am a realist, and I need you.
So I am going to be generous.
I will let you go without a bit of trouble and with lots of cash.
You just have to do one thing for me.
You think I wouldn't kill you?
I could and I would.
Susan!
Susan!
Jiro!
Jiro!
Do you think you can change your ideals now?
Are you ready with an answer right now?
Susan, don't do it.
Shut up.
Let's see how your hero likes you when you're disfigured a little bit.
Let's see what the ice will do to your lovely skin.
No. Susan!
It's Kong.
It's Kong.
Kong's escaped.
Get the keys.
Hurry, Susan.
Kong's escaped!
Look out!
The robot is ready.
Go get that ape.
- You're still alive.
- How did you get out of the chamber?
- Dr. Who left the keys on the desk...
- Talk later. We've got to go.
This way.
Don't worry, there's no poison in this.
It looks like we have all failed.
Let's forget Element X and enjoy a drink.
Stand up.
Can Kong stay in the water a long time?
Yes, he can swim a little.
More than you can.
He travels from Mondo to other islands as he pleases.
Don't you realize that you are through, Doctor?
We're all through.
We are all leaving now in pursuit. Get ready to go.
You're a failure.
Not a chance of that.
You'll see when I get Kong, and this girl will do what I say.
Get going.
Ready. Lower.
Let it down.
The radio just had some interesting news.
Kong swam ashore, near Tokyo.
Don't go. Don't take that robot into Tokyo.
I cannot permit it.
Wait. It could be our last chance to get Kong.
At sea, our robot Kong cannot get him.
On ground, the machine will take the real Kong without any doubt.
I'm not concerned about which one wins.
There's too great a risk.
It just can't be.
Why are you so highhanded,
Madame?
If those two fight in Tokyo... thousands would get killed, and you and I know it.
Suddenly, you're such a moralist.
Tell us, how come?
Element X is a real killer.
Not millions, not 10 millions...
100 or so millions would get killed this time.
It's just that my country...
We can't stand an international incident right now.
Dear Madame, let's talk inside.
The giant Kong has swum ashore...
and he's approaching
the center of Tokyo.
The Defense Agency urgently requests
all citizens to take shelter immediately.
Take shelter immediately.
Please, we should hurry.
Why are you helping us now?
My work now isn't so important, but you are.
Something happen between you and Dr. Who?
I can't tell you.
When you get to shore, lead Kong outside Tokyo.
Otherwise, thousands will get killed.
You're coming with us.
Sorry. I can't do it.
You can't stay behind, you'll be alone.
You don't know what Dr. Who will do.
Don't worry about it.
The things you're going to need are in the next cabin.
We just can't let you stay here.
You should know that I represent a certain country.
I'll take full responsibility for you.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry my country wasn't right.
Now hurry.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Good luck.
Hey, you!
Where are you going? Hey, you!
Don't use that gun.
You'll get the whole country out here.
Don't do it! Don't!
Here's where he came ashore.
He first appeared in the bay, here.
Stop your attack immediately.
If you force Kong to fight, he'll destroy the city.
- Who are you?
- I'm... Well, I'm out of uniform... but I'm Cdr. Carl Nelson, captain of the UN submarine, Explorer.
Yes.
Now, we'll do everything we can to try and calm him down.
But you must hold off your troops.
Hey!
Let me go.
Please, don't.
He'll get angry.
Then he'll destroy the city.
Headquarters.
Turn off lights. Fall back.
Fall back.
That's right, sir. Hold it!
Hey!
It's all right.
Kong!
The UN?
Yeah.
Take this. Here.
Kong!
Kong!
Is she insane?
She's all right.
Kong is always gentle with her.
Calm down, Kong.
We're your friends.
Hey! Look at that!
Oh, no.
Come on, take shelter.
Hurry!
Where can we go?
Look at that.
No, Kong, run away.
You mustn't fight him.
It's not alive, it's a machine.
You can't defeat him, Kong.
Kong! Run away! Run away!
The real Kong seems quicker.
My Kong won't tire.
Behind you. Get the girl.
Kong! Kong!
Kong, listen!
You will return quietly
to the ship.
If you don't,
I'll drop the girl.
Help me. Kong!
We will get him now.
Prepare to dock the ship.
You each know your job.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well?
My plans were really correct.
We're a success.
A gun, Madame?
You're going to die.
Step back there and turn around.
What did you do?
Nothing.
I'm Nomura with the UN.
Yes, sir.
- I need a ranger unit, order it.
- Right.
On the double!
Susan, wait.
Wait there.
Jiro.
Hold on.
Go on. Easy.
Go get them a rope.
Susan, don't worry.
We're just about there.
Kong.
Susan!
Jiro!
There they are.
Susan.
Quick, the other control.
Stop it, let her go.
Hey, get out of here.
Let's go!
Go!
- Susan!
- Commander!
Thank God, you're alive.
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all over now.
Weigh anchor right away.
What's wrong here?
Shouldn't we wait till Kong is brought here?
Moron! The real Kong is lost to us.
Kong's coming!
He's here, on the docks.
Kong's on the docks?
Yes.
We have to go.
You said we were here... to get Kong and the girl.
No, get us out of here now.
Now! Do as I say.
Kong, stop that ship.
Get the ship, Kong.
Sir, hello.
Will he catch it?
Yeah. I think he will.
On deck. Let's go.
There he is.
Let's get him.
Keep firing.
Let's go.
Kong! Kong!
King Kong!
Don't call.
Yeah, let him go.
But he's going...
He's going home.
I think he's had enough of what we call civilization.
Well?
Zeus, king of the gods of the Greeks...
...write in the ashes so that I may read the future.
I see...
...a great tree at the end of the world.
And in its branches there hang the skull and the skin of a ram.
They gleam and shine...
...for it is a prize of the gods, a Golden Fleece.
We've no time for riddles and mysteries. Tell me of tonight.
Pelias, you will conquer tonight.
You will overthrow the kingdom of Thessaly.
You will kill the king, Aristo, and wear his crown.
You will do all these things without fear or wound...
...because Zeus commands it.
If I'm protected by Zeus,
I will have no need of this.
I will lay it on the fire as a thank offering to the gods.
Pelias...
...it is also foretold that although you will win the throne of Aristo...
...you will, when Zeus ordains, lose it...
...to one of Aristo's children.
- Then Aristo will have no children.
- He has three, Pelias.
Two daughters,
Philomela and Briseis...
...and a son, Jason.
Then two daughters and a son will die with their father tonight.
Hera, queen of gods, protect this child, my sister Philomela.
And if I, Briseis, am worthy...
...take me into your protection.
Are you Briseis, the daughter of Aristo?
Be silent. She is praying.
For her sister and for her murdered father, Aristo.
Are you a priestess?
I serve the gods.
Then tell me, has Briseis called upon the goddess Hera?
She has.
And has the goddess heard her prayer?
Yes.
Then pray for me.
It is the will of Zeus.
It is not the will of Zeus.
It is your will.
Zeus has given you a kingdom.
The rest will be your own doing.
The gods abandon you, Pelias.
A one-sandaled man shall come...
...and no god shall protect you from him.
A one-sandaled man?
The child who has escaped you:
Jason.
Then why was I not told the whole prophecy?
Why did Zeus drive me to kill this girl...
...when the only one I needed to kill was Jason?
Zeus cannot drive men to do what you have done.
Men drive themselves to do such things...
...that the gods may know them...
...and that men may understand themselves.
The killing of Jason would do you no good.
Kill Jason and you kill yourself.
Zeus, my godly husband, did you, for some reason...
...order the profanation of my temple in Thessaly?
That was entirely the thought of Pelias.
Not content with winning the throne of Thessaly, as I wished...
...he tried to avoid losing it as I have commanded.
I know that you've been insulted, my dear.
But be content.
The boy, Jason, has escaped.
- He will avenge you.
- How?
You must know by now I never arrange exact and precise details...
And because you are neither exact nor precise, a young girl was killed...
...and my temple was profaned.
- I want to help Jason.
- No.
You may help the infant, Philomela, if you wish. She's a girl.
The rest is man's work.
No. I want to help Jason.
As you wish.
How many times did Aristo's daughter
Briseis call upon you?
- By name?
- Five.
Well, then you can help her brother five times.
Five times only you can help him to overthrow Pelias.
And that is my final word.
It will be 20 years before Jason becomes a man.
Oh, an instant of time here on Mount Olympus...
...but a long 20 years for King Pelias.
He cautiously travels the roads of Thessaly.
Yes, Pelias, you have had years of watching and waiting...
...for the man who must come to kill you.
The man with one sandal.
I owe you my life.
That was as good a way to ford a river as any.
But I seem to have lost a sandal in doing it.
Where are you traveling?
To the palace of the king.
- Pelias?
- Pelias of Thessaly.
Then I can put you on your way.
But first, you must accept the hospitality of my camp.
Come.
Be seated.
You have not yet told me your name.
I am Jason, the lawful king of Thessaly.
One of my father's soldiers rescued me and brought me up in exile.
Now I've returned to claim my kingdom.
I have waited for you for 20 years.
And in that 20 years,
Pelias has turned my kingdom...
...from the pride of Greece to a savage, evil land.
I shall need your help.
When your father defended his throne, no man fought harder than I.
This time it will not be enough to fight.
I could fight.
I could find Pelias and kill him.
But the people need more than a leader.
They must believe the gods have not deserted them.
- They need a miracle.
- And where will you find this miracle?
I have heard there is a tree at the end of the world...
...with a fleece of gold hanging in its branches.
I have heard this too.
So have many men.
They say it is a gift of the gods.
It has the power to heal, bring peace and rid the land of plague and famine.
If I could find this prize and bring it home to Thessaly...
...then it would inspire the people, wipe out the years of misrule.
They would know the gods have not abandoned them.
My land would be rich and strong again...
...as it was before this tyrant, Pelias, murdered my father.
Jason...
...be advised by me.
First, search for this Golden Fleece.
Do not reveal yourself to Pelias, but build a ship...
...and find a crew, and when you have this prize...
...then and only then...
...return and kill Pelias.
And now rest yourself.
My companions are yours to command.
Father, why do you let him live?
If I destroy him, Acastus,
I destroy myself.
While he is searching for the Golden Fleece...
...he is at the ends of the earth and I am safe.
And if he finds it?
You will be there.
Have you come to pray to the gods, Jason?
If I had, I wouldn't have chosen a fallen one.
Only a statue.
Sometimes the gods argue amongst themselves.
Then great winds blow...
...and temples fall.
- Hermes.
- Yes?
No, I said the statue was the god Hermes.
- Hermes.
- Yes.
A bringer of dreams and a prowler of the night.
Jason.
No man can tell you how to find the fleece.
Is it not time you asked the gods?
They will not answer those who believe in them.
Why should they answer one who doesn't?
Come with me.
Why?
So that you will believe...
...and be answered.
You win, my lord.
That is, the battle, not the war.
Oh, those waters are far too shallow for galleys.
Hera, my dear, you really must learn to win without cheating.
Or at least to lose gracefully.
- Greetings, Hermes.
- Greetings, my lord Zeus.
There seems to be a piece missing.
Perhaps I can help.
Welcome to Olympus, Jason.
Jason come to Mount Olympus at last.
No man calls upon the gods unless he wants something.
We arranged for you to be brought here by Hermes.
I wouldn't have believed a mortal could ask the help of the gods...
...much less visit them.
Well, at least you're honest.
Which is more than I can say for most other mortals.
What is it you want?
A ship? A crew?
No. Those I can find myself.
And what are you going to use in place of gold?
The hearts of men.
I am Hera, queen of the gods and your protector on this voyage.
But my lord Zeus has decreed a limit to the number of times...
...I may help you when you call upon me. Do not speak now.
I know what you must ask of me.
Does the Golden Fleece exist?
And if so, where is it?
That's two questions.
And I shall help him with only one answer.
Search in the land of Colchis.
Then it does exist.
But Colchis...
That's the end of the world.
No Greek has ever sailed there.
Now that you've heard that...
...are you so sure that you will not need my help?
Think carefully.
I offered him a ship.
A ship and a crew.
And he refused me.
Refused the help of the gods?
What ship is strong enough to reach to the edge of the world?
What crew brave enough to sail in her?
I shall tell the shipbuilders of Greece...
...that the richest cargo in the world waits in Colchis.
The Golden Fleece is worth a kingdom.
I shall say that only the strongest ship ever built will survive the voyage.
The athletes of Greece are proud.
I'll tell them only the best can expect a place...
...in the most perilous voyage in history.
I shall announce a games...
...invite the strongest and bravest of the Greeks.
No greater games shall ever be held...
...unless the gods decree otherwise.
I did well to choose you, Jason.
The gods are best served by those who want their help least.
Welcome, Polydeuces.
Castor of Sparta.
Acastus of Thessaly.
Well done, Acastus.
Phalerus of Athens, champion archer of Greece.
Euphemus of Taenarum.
Spyros of Syracuse.
Hercules!
He's here!
I mean to sail with you, Jason. Tell me which champion you want me to beat.
No one. I know you can beat us all.
Your place is reserved.
Hercules. Yes.
- Hercules?
- Yes.
My name is Hylas.
Like you, I came too late to compete in the games.
But it occurs to me that if I can beat you at something...
...Jason couldn't refuse me a place on the ship either.
After all, he might need brains as well as brawn.
Shall we compete?
Discus?
Come on.
- See that rock?
- Yes.
No thrower has ever reached it.
And is the contest to hit it or pass it?
You'll be lucky if you get halfway.
- Now, go on.
- No, after you, Hercules.
I've never thrown a discus before.
I'd like to see how it's done.
Let Hylas have his moment of triumph while he may.
You shall have your place, Hylas.
Hail Hylas!
I have found the finest crew in all Greece.
Now for a ship that is worthy of them.
Argos.
- Argos.
- Hello?
Is that you, Argos?
- Who's there?
- It's Jason.
Come aboard.
So you've come back again.
She's a fine ship.
Yes.
She is a fine ship.
She's ready to sail.
We've yet to give her a name.
I'll call her the Argo, after her builder.
The Argo?
Well, you'd better have a look at the figurehead.
It might make you change your mind.
No, this way.
- Is it forward?
- No, it's astern.
We'll have to move it.
It's supposed to watch over the water ahead of the vessel.
I can't help that.
Something made me put it here.
Hera, queen of the gods.
- What?
- Nothing.
You don't object to it here?
- No.
- Nor do I.
It makes me feel someone friendly is watching over us.
- When do we sail?
- Tomorrow.
Don't waste it.
There isn't enough left to make any difference, Jason.
Oh, let him rest.
But the sooner we find some island with water, the better.
We can't row much longer on three sips a day.
Take my advice. Put back to Icos.
But we'd lose five days' sailing.
We haven't water enough for tomorrow...
...let alone the time it would take to reach Icos.
Don't worry, Hylas.
I don't expect him to take my advice.
But I wish he'd listen to someone.
Still grumbling?
Sailors always grumble.
These sailors have something to grumble about.
Hardly any water. Blistered hands.
- They should use brine.
- Brine?
It toughens the skin.
Well, go down and treat them.
I'll steer.
Hera.
You said you could help me a certain number of times.
So far, you've told me of Colchis.
And I threw Pelias from his horse and dragged him beneath the water.
Pelias?
So that was King Pelias.
I know your need.
Set sail and steer north.
- You will reach land at noon.
- Where?
The Isle of Bronze.
I've never heard of it.
No mortal has.
It was the foundry of the gods.
Hephaestus labored there, making armor and weapons for Zeus.
Oh, do not fear. Hephaestus himself has long departed.
I will see that you reach the Isle of Bronze.
But listen to me, Jason.
Listen very carefully.
- Take the helm.
- Yes, sir.
Set sail.
We reach land at noon.
Then you can fill your bellies until they grumble as much as your tongues.
Now, mark this.
It will be safe to take food and water.
But nothing else.
Absolutely nothing else.
That doesn't include women?
If there are any on the island, yes, it does.
If I meet a girl with a firm leg, a full bosom and a warm heart...
...let no man try and stop me.
- Talos will.
- Who's Talos?
You do mean there's a man there who wants a fight?
I spoke of no man.
Food and water, Hercules.
That's all.
Jason, who told you of this island?
The goddess Hera.
Port helm.
Steady as you go.
Furl the sail.
Ashore for food and water.
- Are goats good sailors?
- Goats? What are you talking about?
What do you want with goats onboard ship?
Well, some of us might be hungry...
...or thirsty.
Come on.
Here's one for the pot.
Hercules.
Isn't he one of the Titans?
He might be. He's big enough.
Didn't Jason say something about Talos?
This must be where Hephaestus molded the statues of the gods.
Yes. And set them up for all the world to see.
Hercules.
It's a treasure chamber.
The treasure chamber of the gods.
Look at this.
And this.
A pearl.
It's a javelin.
Don't be silly. In a jewel box?
It's a brooch pin.
Well, whatever it is, it'll make a useful weapon.
Let's get back to the ship.
- Hercules.
- Well, what is it?
- You'd better put it back.
- Why?
- Remember what Jason said?
- It won't be missed.
Anyway, if the gods leave all this lying about unguarded...
...they obviously don't want it.
Come on.
It must have been the wind.
And you saw nothing of them after that?
Perhaps Hercules found a woman after all.
Talos.
- Back water.
- Back. Back water.
Back.
I warned you, Jason.
This is Hercules' doing.
Talos will try to kill all of you.
How can I fight him?
Think before you waste the gift of the gods.
Against a man of bronze, our weapons are useless.
I repeat that question.
Then I must answer it.
Fight Talos with your wits rather than your courage.
And look to his ankles.
His ankles?
There is nothing else I can tell you.
Jason.
You disobeyed my order.
Lure him to these rocks, but stay out of reach.
- And what will you do?
- I shall hide here, Acastus.
I shall do my very best to send him to you, Jason.
My very best.
Mind his foot!
Quick, get back to the rocks.
Hylas.
Hercules, you've left your...
- Well?
- We searched, Argos.
And I will search again.
Hylas was with us.
We saw him running.
But then he disappeared.
He could've been hurt, not able to get back to the ship.
Like Palinuros.
We had to carry him aboard.
Hercules, Hylas is dead.
The gods decided it.
Why kill a boy for my grave fault?
But I should have stayed with him.
Search until nightfall.
We won't sail till then.
Sail when you please, Jason.
I cannot leave this island till I've found Hylas.
Jason.
Will you abandon Hercules, the best man among us?
- I, for one, won't sail without him.
- Nor shall I.
Nor I.
Come with me.
Hylas!
Is there any man here who does not obey the gods?
We will do as the goddess Hera commands, if she will speak to us.
This is your last chance, Jason.
The last time that I can help you.
I understand.
Then know this, Argonauts.
- Hylas is dead.
- Hylas is dead.
As for Hercules, he is not fated to go further with the Argo.
Zeus has other tasks for him.
And for us, Hera?
Sail to Phrygia.
Seek out Phineas, the blinded man.
Only he can guide you now.
We set sail.
Come on, back to your places.
Back to your places.
Get forward there.
Go away!
Devils! Demons!
Lord Zeus, I was a sinner.
I've never tried to deny it.
But I didn't sin every day.
Why, then, do you punish me every day?
What in the name of the gods are they?
Jason.
- Are you Phineas?
- Yes.
Take my arm. I can't see yours.
Don't flinch.
Zeus gave me the gift of prophecy, but I misused it...
...so I was blinded.
Zeus ordered the Harpies to torment me.
You, Jason, now listen to me.
The gods have ordered me to tell you whatever you want to know.
But the gods have gone too far with me.
They can punish a man so much, and then one day he abandons them.
He says, "All right, Zeus.
Throw a thunderbolt.
Let the earth swallow me.
I defy you."
You growl away all you like, Zeus.
I mean what I say. Jason.
I'll tell you what you want to know...
...only if you'll meet my price.
What is your price then?
Free me from these tormenting Harpies.
If Zeus sent those creatures to plague him...
...we'd be unwise to interfere.
That's my price.
Then we'll meet it, Phineas.
We'll make you the master of the Harpies.
Get to the ropes!
Now.
Castor. Phalerus.
Find some wood to build a cage.
Here you are, you hungry fellow.
A big fish for you and some more wine.
Well, Phineas, we've completed our part of the bargain.
- What is it you want to know?
- The way to Colchis.
The way to Colchis is through the Clashing Rocks.
Steer northwest and you'll reach them in five days.
Northwest, eh?
After the Clashing Rocks, you turn northeast.
Before long, you'll sight the shores of Colchis.
But tell me, what gods protect you?
None now.
Then you won't pass the Clashing Rocks.
- What are the Clashing Rocks?
- They speak for themselves, don't they?
All I can offer you is this.
It's not much reward for what you've done...
...but it's all I have.
If that's all you can tell us, then goodbye.
The gods be merciful to you.
Phineas, from now on, they'll witness a banquet every night...
...and eat the scraps you leave.
Good appetite.
There's not much water here.
Steady as you go. Row easy.
Easy, all.
Easy, all!
It's a narrow channel...
...but I can't see what made Phineas so frightened.
It looks calm enough.
Too calm.
Acastus!
I know the sea god's moods.
But most of them are dangerous.
Acastus, take a sounding.
The rest of you, be prepared to row when I give the word.
But an easy stroke.
Save your strength.
They may need it later.
Ship ahoy!
There she is.
She doesn't seem to be in any great difficulty.
A whole ship's crew.
And Lynceus from the masthead.
There was no hope of saving him, not in that sea.
Are we going through?
- Yes.
- But it's...
All right, we're going through.
Back to your places.
There's no turning back now.
No, Acastus.
There's no turning back on this voyage.
Drummer, beat out the stroke...
...but keep it easy.
The gods want their entertainment.
Jason goes too far.
Because he speaks the truth when the gods themselves go too far?
Turn back, Jason. We're trapped.
- Trapped, Hera.
- It seems so.
You've left me only one move.
Pray to the gods, Jason.
The gods of Greece are cruel.
In time, all men shall learn to do without them.
Pull! Pull!
Get back to your place.
Pull!
Pull till your hides crack and your backs break.
Pull!
Keep the stroke going.
Jason dared to speak of the end of the gods...
...and yet you let him live.
If I were to punish every blasphemy,
I'd soon lose all loyalty and respect.
You are the god of many men.
Yet when those men no longer believe in you...
...then you'll return to nothing.
You understand that, and yet you remain with me.
You think it weak of me, my lord?
Not weak.
Almost human.
Whichever god or goddess helped us...
...is to be thanked.
Those others weren't so fortunate.
What's that?
Who are you?
Your ship was lost.
We found only two other survivors.
They're being looked after.
Here. Drink this.
When did you sail from Colchis?
Dawn, this morning.
Dawn?
Then our journey is nearly over.
- Where have you come from?
- Thessaly.
But that's the other side of the world.
You don't look like a merchant.
Your vessel's a fighting ship.
We'd be foolish to sail unarmed.
By all accounts, your king, Aeetes, fears the gods...
...and we were sent by the gods.
But I'm gonna talk to him alone, peacefully.
Now you answer a question.
What was your ship doing in such dangerous waters?
We came to sacrifice to the gods of the rocks...
...to throw flowers onto the sea to make it safe for our ships.
I'm afraid our gods were angry, not so powerful as yours.
Are you a priestess?
I serve in the temple of Hecate.
A dancer.
Is Hecate the god of the Colchians?
The goddess.
But I'd heard they worship some strange idol...
...the skull and skin of a ram.
No ordinary ram.
Its fleece is of gold.
A gift of the gods themselves...
...and it's brought our city great peace and prosperity.
We'll put you ashore at dawn tomorrow.
Perhaps you will show me the way to the city.
Now, tell me your name.
Medea.
And you can answer my first question.
- Who are you?
- My name is Jason.
Within a few hours, we shall sight Colchis.
I'm coming in quietly by night.
Now the voyage is over,
I don't want the trouble to begin.
Won't be any trouble, Jason.
Just tell us where the city is and when we attack.
We don't attack.
But that's foolish. You have the finest fighting men in the world.
Forty fighting men against a nation?
Better 40 than one, Jason.
We're not pirates, Phalerus.
What's that girl done to you?
We thought you were a fighting man.
I'm going up alone in the morning to see what the situation is.
Oh, you mean spy out the land.
Well, why alone?
Why not take a few of us scouting?
The fewer who go, the less can get caught.
- What's the fewest you can think of?
- One, of course.
Right. I accept your advice.
But I don't.
Having sailed this far together, we're free to speak our minds.
And what's on yours, Acastus?
We nose our way upstream, rush the guards and seize the fleece.
We'd be out into the open sea while Aeetes is still asleep.
- A night attack?
- Yes.
And in the dark, during the attack, a man will die.
That man will be me.
A javelin in my back.
A Greek javelin, Acastus.
Maybe your javelin.
- You'll die for that, Jason.
- Keep back.
Euphemus.
It's Euphemus. He's dead.
Look at this. Slashed and bloody.
Acastus must be at the bottom of the sea.
I wonder.
- Make sail.
- And Euphemus?
The sea was his kingdom while he was alive.
Let it take his body now he's dead.
Make sail.
Make sail!
You're wounded.
We have a flower in Colchis which heals and soothes.
Tomorrow, I'll show you.
What do you call the flower?
It has no name.
It grows on a double stalk.
They say it sprang from the blood of Prometheus.
And it has been used over the years for its soothing and curing powers.
The sun's getting higher.
We must be on our way.
Follow the road to the east.
You're not coming further?
I go another way.
The goddess Hecate has spoken.
There will be one among us today...
...from the ends of the world.
His name is Jason.
Any man of whom he asks his way...
...shall say this:
"Aeetes, king of Colchis...
...awaits him in the temple of Hecate."
And that is all any man shall say to him.
Come forward, Jason.
You have done all of us a great service.
Tonight, we shall feast you.
We know of your great heroism, and it deserves celebration.
Return, then, to your companions and bring them to my palace.
I thank you, my lord...
...but I do not understand.
- Medea?
- Welcome to Colchis.
I give you Jason and the Argonauts.
Jason and the Argonauts!
Tell me, Jason, why did you come to Colchis?
In peace.
I said "why," not "how."
Altogether, how many men have you?
Enough.
And you say you do not threaten us?
Envoys who come to me in deceit remain in death.
I know you've come for the fleece.
I know, too, that if you cannot win it by bargaining, you plan to steal it.
But we'll never part with it, Jason.
It is a gift of the gods.
It has brought wealth and peace to Colchis.
Should we ever let it go, it would mean plague and famine...
...and the destruction of our country!
We can no longer welcome or entertain you...
...but treat you as you deserve.
As thieves...
...as pirates...
...as murderers.
We give our thanks to one person.
The person who exposed a criminal attempt on our kingdom:
The son of King Pelias of Thessaly...
...Acastus.
Hail!
Hecate, queen of darkness...
...you've always helped me.
Tell me now what I must do.
You, who gave me the gift of foresight...
...why didn't you reveal to me
Acastus' treachery?
He who sits drinking with Aeetes...
...while Jason...
...imprisoned, condemned to death.
If I help him now in the quest for the fleece...
...I shall be a traitor to my country...
...and to you, Hecate.
And if not...
...to myself.
Help me, Hecate.
Medea.
Why did you come here?
Was it Aeetes who sent you?
I came to ask you to give up your quest...
...and sail away with the Argonauts in peace.
Never return.
Never to think of the Golden Fleece?
Never to think of the fleece.
Then it was Aeetes.
You tell him I will fulfill the task the gods have sent me...
...and never betray the Argonauts, whatever he offers me.
Even if it's Medea, high priestess of Hecate.
Please...
...forget the Golden Fleece.
I fear for your safety.
If you're set on carrying it away...
...I must come with you.
I'll go alone.
No.
I have to go with you.
I have no country now.
And I love you.
Castor, Phalerus, Dmitrius, get to the door.
The rest of you, back to your places.
- The priestess.
- Argos, listen to Medea.
When you're clear of the palace, go to the ship and row downstream.
There's a break in the cliff and a path through the woods.
Anchor there. We'll join you.
Well, what is it?
- Jason has escaped.
- And his men?
They were all gone. I was making my rounds, found the guards drugged.
Drugged?
Then there's an accomplice.
- Where's Acastus?
- He's not in his quarters.
Acastus help Jason?
But there's no reason to it.
Unless it was Medea who mixed the drug.
The high priestess of Hecate?
I saw how Medea looked at Jason.
If Medea's helping them, then she's guiding them to the Golden Fleece...
...and the Argonauts will take ship.
The landward way is shorter.
Muster your men, captain.
Listen.
Soldiers.
Phalerus, Castor, you come with me.
- No, not you, Polydeuces.
- But, Argos...
You stay aboard with the rest of the men and guard the ship.
Jason.
Aeetes and the Colchians.
We heard them from the ship.
They must be somewhere near.
Get the fleece.
Guards, follow them up there and that way.
Wait.
Hecate, queen of darkness...
...revenge yourself against the Thessalians.
Deliver to me the children of the Hydra's teeth...
...the children of the night.
The teeth.
Fetch me the Hydra's teeth, quickly.
Against the children of the Hydra's teeth...
...there is no protection.
The fleece. Give me the fleece.
It has the power to heal.
It's true.
It does have the power to heal.
Jason!
Hold the guards back, captain, or they may die...
...killed with Jason and his pirates.
Rise up, you dead, slain of the Hydra.
Rise from your graves and avenge us.
Those who steal the Golden Fleece must die.
Argos, get down to the ship.
- Take Medea.
- Come with me.
There.
And there.
And still another.
Wait.
And more.
Destroy them!
Kill!
Kill, kill, kill them all!
Get back.
I think that proves at last that I'm a worthy opponent, my lord.
Where are you going?
- To clear the board. The game is over.
- It certainly is not.
For the moment let them enjoy a calm sea...
...a fresh breeze and each other.
The girl is pretty, and I was always sentimental.
But for Jason there are other adventures.
I have not yet finished with Jason.
Let us continue the game another day.
Will you stop your daydreaming,
Tommy Stubbins?
- Hello, Matt.
- Come and help me select a suitable dinner...
- for me clients here.
- Can I push the barrow?
Well, it's not gonna push itself now, is it?
It's against my religion to do anything violent till the end of the day.
God bless all Irishmen.
You know what I was thinking, Matt?
- No, what was that?
Not for you, me darling.
It'll make your fur fall out.
I was thinking that if you sold your fish barrow, and I sold my grandfather's watch, we could buy a boat and go to China.
Oh. Oh, you're the middle and two ends of a fine fellow, Tom.
It's a beautiful proposition, but don't you see the problem?
- What's that?
- Well, do you speak Chinese?
- No.
- Then, if you sell your grandfather's watch, and we go to China, how are you goin' to tell the time?
- I never thought of that.
- Ah, well, you see, you have to plan ahead.
It's very important.
I mean, the whole secret of my success with the fish barrow... was years of planning ahead.
Thank you, Charlie.
May the 17 holy men of Donnybrook reward you in heaven.
I'd sooner you rewarded me down here.
- Who's this then?
- Wild duck off the marshes.
- Is that a fact?
- Flew straight into the mast, cross-eyed fool.
Can you imagine that now?
He was probably under the influence.
He looks Irish to me.
Don't worry.
I'll fix him up.
Bring him back.
That's my dinner.
Now don't ask me to do that, Charlie.
As Secretary for the Preservation of Irish Ducks, it's more than me job is worth.
You never told me you were secretary of Irish ducks.
Oh, well, now I don't talk about it much.
- I'm a very modest fella.
- What are we going to do with it then?
Well, now, as soon as
I finish me deliveries, we'll take him over to John Dolittle.
- Here.
- Who's John Dolittle?
Eat hearty, me lovelies.
- And heaven bless all Catholic pussycats.
- Who is John Dolittle?
John Dolittle is the greatest animal doctor in the world today... and a close personal friend of Matthew Mugg.
He lives right here in Puddleby, he does.
- Out on the Oxenthorpe Road.
- What does he do?
He's a genius. That's what he does.
He can talk to animals.
- Talk to them?
- Speaks their language, he does.
Just like you and me's chatting now.
He'll have a word with that little fellow in wild duck talk... and put him straight in no time.
Oh, the darlin' man.
He'd think nothin' of travelin' halfway round the world to cure a sick sparrow.
Only last week, he went all the way to Africa.
Ask me why.
- Why?
- Why? I'll tell you.
To look after a crocodile with toothache.
He's altogether a marvelous man.
And he understands the Irish.
And any man who understands the Irish
Can't be reckoned altogether bad
The same way that the lunatic
Whose patron saint is Patrick
Can't be reckoned altogether mad
The doctor's very smart
He's an Irishman at heart
His favorite color
Sure it must be green
And also he's a man
Who'll blarney when he can
Let me explain the sort of thing I mean
My friend the doctor says the moon is made of apple pie
And once a month it's eaten by the sun
And that is why up in the sky
You'll find as every month goes by
Somebody in the sky is making another one
My friend the doctor says the sun is made of cheddar cheese
The doctor even knows the reason why
The facts are these
Try if you please
Pretending you're a lonely cheese
Wouldn't you want to try finding an apple pie
Of course you would.
Maybe what the doctor tells me
Isn't altogether true
But I love every tale he tells me
I don't know any better ones
Do you?
My friend the doctor says the world is full of fantasy
And who are you and I to disagree
Let's hope and pray that is the way
The life we love will always stay
For my friend the doctor
And me
La, la, la, la
Here, Tom, catch!
My friend the doctor says the stars are made of lemon drops
The bigger ones are lollipops and ice  Come on!
The clouds have shops up on the top
That sells you sweets and soda pop
What do they call the place
-  Isn't it paradise
My friend the doctor says that every time it starts to rain
And people run indoors again in swarms
If you remain out in the rain
You'll think you're drinking pink champagne
And you'll spend your life praying for thunderstorms
Maybe what the doctor tells me
Isn't altogether true
But I love every tale he tells me
I don't know any better ones
Do you?
My friend the doctor says the world is full of fantasy
And who are you and I to disagree
Let's hope and pray that is the way
The life we love will always stay for my friend the doctor
My friend the doctor and me
What was that?
- Ah, now, that's just some of his pets.
- Pets?
Polynesia, me lovely little darling.
Give us a kiss then. Here.
And, Chee-Chee, how are you, me old rascal?
I'd like you to meet one of me dearest friends. Master Thomas Stubbins.
Tom, this is Miss Polynesia.
How do you do, Master Stubbins?
How do you do, Miss Polynesia?
You wanna watch out for her, Tom.
She's 199 years old.
She can remember every single word that's been spoken to her... since the execution of Charles I in 1648.
- Isn't that right, Polynesia?
- No, Matthew, 'twas 1649.
'Twas a Tuesday.
Oh, yeah, right.
You see what I mean?
And this is Chee-Chee.
- How do you do, Chee-Chee?
- Where's the good doctor?
- He's working in the library.
Show them in, Chee-Chee.
I know he's in there.
Good heavens, Matthew.
Oh, I'm terrible sorry. I must have frightened them out of their lives.
Matthew, you're soaking wet.
You're a little on the damp side yourself, sir.
Oh, it's these fish languages.
They really only work underwater.
It's fascinating.
The basic system is mouth movements and bubble signals.
At the moment,
I can only make big bubbles, and they keep telling me I'm shouting.
Beggin' me ignorance, sir, but what can you hope to get out of a conversation with a goldfish?
Matthew, I'll show you.
The legendary great pink sea snail.
For hundreds of years, sailors have claimed that they've seen it.
Oh, poor devils.
It's that rotten stock they drink.
But, uh, what has this got to do with goldfish?
I don't believe it's legendary.
I believe it actually exists.
What's that got to do with goldfish?
Well, I'm planning a voyage to find it.
That is, if I can get enough money together.
Oh, may the saints reward you, sir.
But, uh, what's that got to do with the...
Well, if I find it, Matthew,
I'm going to want to talk to it.
Therefore, I have to acquire a knowledge of ancient shellfish, which is extremely complicated.
So, I'm starting with basic fish languages, like halibut, mackerel and goldfish.
Ah, there, you see? I knew it had something to do with goldfish.
Now, about your last voyage, Doctor.
Did, uh, did you find the crocodile with a toothache?
Crocodile?
Oh, yes, in the Congo, yes.
I got back on Saturday.
- Look.
- Isn't that a beauty now?
Make a marvelous bottle opener.
Look at that, Tom.
Oh, forgive me, Doctor.
- This is me ol' pal, Tommy Stubbins.
- How do you do, sir?
- He's brought a patient for you.
- It's a duck, sir.
- It's a drake.
You're sopping wet too.
- Yes, sir, it's raining.
He's hurt his wing, sir.
- Yes, so he's been telling me.
Oh, quack, quack.
Oh, poor chap, yes.
Sorry.
Quack, quack.
He had a row with his wife and wasn't looking where he was going.
He told you all that?
They're very neurotic creatures.
You'll be all right by the morning.
Yes, I'll get word to your wife.
Quack, quack, quack.
Now, while our friend's convalescing,
I'll try and find you something dry to wear.
Then, we all can have some food together.
- Polynesia, two more for dinner.
- Yes, Doctor.
Oh, and, Matthew, hold on to that crocodile's tooth.
Must be a bottle somewhere you can open with it.
Gub-Gub.
Will you please stop making that infernal noise?
A few pork sausages and a bit of bacon.
The way you're carrying on, you'd think we were cooking your entire family.
Chee-Chee, make him behave.
But you can hardly blame him for being a bit upset, Doctor.
I'd be upset meself if you started frying Irishmen.
You know the problem as well as I do, Matthew.
I've nearly 600 mouths to feed, including the mice.
- Six hundred!
- Yes. So if the butcher... gives me a string of sausages now and then, I take it, whether it upsets Gub-Gub or not.
Anyway, he eats more than any of us.
Sure you won't be having anything?
- Quite sure. Thank you, Matthew.
- Aren't you hungry, Doctor?
Yes, but I follow a very special diet, Stubbins.
- It's highly nutritious and very good.
- Oh, I see.
The doctor's in rather an awkward position, you see, Tom.
- Aren't you, Doctor?
- What do you mean, Matt?
You understand, Stubbins, he means meat.
It upsets the animals if I, uh...
- Oh, of course.
- So I don't.
As a matter of principle, one should always try to avoid eating one's friends.
The day that I became a veterinarian
I had a sudden overwhelming wish
To be a pure and simple vegetarian
And give up eating all that meat and fish
- I think that's marvelous.
- Meat is very unhealthy for you.
So now I live on healthy food instead
Like apple cores and parsnip juice
And chunks of plain brown bread
All right, all right.
I'm coming.
When I see my fellowman consuming sirloin steak
And I find myself enjoying tea and Dundee cake
There is really only one conclusion I can make
I'm a devoted vegetarian
No, no, no, no, you've had yours.
When my host at dinner offers succulent roast beef
Proudly I refuse it
People stare in disbelief
Lost in admiration as I nibble on a leaf
A very noted vegetarian
I wouldn't even eat horseradish, in case I upset the horses.
I stay away from deviled ham on principle
I wouldn't eat roast duckling if I could
Willpower has made me invincible
My word
Those sausages look good
Where's my dinner gone?
They've done it again.
Come on. Own up. Who's got it this time? Who's got my dinner?
It's bad enough to have to eat this muck in the first place.
Just 'cause I eat this instead of eating them, they think they can take advantage of me.
You've no idea what I put up with on their account.
I eat every flowering shrub there is except for gorse
Sometimes I get luxuries like beetroot leaves, of course
My life's much the same as that of any English horse
Why should I be a vegetarian
Turnip pie and peanuts
That's the sort of filth I eat
Any sort of rubbish that is wholesome and discreet
Why don't I admit that my hypocrisy's complete
If I should live to be a centenarian
Become our most adored humanitarian
I'll never make a decent vegetarian
I'm a cheat, I love meat
I'm a cheat, yes, I am
I love red-blooded juicy chunks of meat
Legs of lamb, sides of beef
And chops and steaks and veal and pork, of course
-  My favorite meal
And then I hear poor Gub-Gub squeal
Oh, me, oh, my
A reluctant but sincere
Vegetarian
Am I
So, you see, Stubbins, being an animal doctor has its problems.
For one thing, you don't get paid anything, at least not in money.
You get bones or nuts or worms... or whatever the particular animal's currency happens to be.
And secondly, most of the animals who come here as patients like it so much, they stay here permanently.
It's hardly what you'd call a profit-making enterprise.
But who looks after the animals?
They look after themselves, for the most part.
Animals are much better at that than human beings.
And how did you become a veteran?
No, Stubbins, the word is "veterinarian."
But say "animal doctor."
It's less pretentious.
It all happened rather suddenly, actually.
My entire life changed in one day, didn't it, Matthew?
It was my sister, Sarah, who started it all.
Sarah.
Oh!
Did you know that an ant has more intelligence than a hippopotamus?
And that a grasshopper... in relation to his size... has more power in his hind legs than a kangaroo?
Absolutely fascinating.
There's no doubt about it. Animals are much more interesting than people.
Good heavens, Sarah.
What on Earth are you doing down there?
There are pigeons in the linen cupboard.
- Oh, yes, I thought it would be warmer for them.
- You knew?
Yes, I put them there. It gets so terribly chilly on the roof at night.
And two tortoises in the guest room.
That's where they are.
I wondered where they got to.
- And white mice in your chest of drawers.
- That's right.
And the grass snakes are in the roll top desk under the envelopes.
Grass snakes?
John Dolittle, if those animals aren't out of this house by tonight...
Oh, dear!
Nine o'clock precisely.
That will be Lady Petherington.
I wonder what she's found wrong with herself today.
All right, Sarah.
Show her in, please.
I mean it, John.
I shall leave.
Those animals, they're destroying your practice.
You won't have a decent patient left soon.
Not unless you answer the door.
I don't understand the things that go on around this house with those animals.
And we'll probably never see the vicar's wife again... after giving her that glass of milk with a frog in it.
I really don't know what you expect me to do.
Oh, good morning,
Lady Petherington.
Are we feeling better today?
We're no better for being left to freeze to death on Doctor's front doorsteps.
Oh.
Dr. Dolittle, oh, it's my nerves.
You must do something for them instantly.
Oh, you'll never guess what happened.
It's quite the worst experience of my life.
Uh, won't you come in,
Lady Petherington?
I was giving this dinner party last night... up at the Grange for the Duke of St. Albans.
Fifty guests. The most embarrassing moment of my entire life.
A mouse ran across the table.
Oh, I thought I'd die.
I may still.
Can you imagine? A mouse.
Do you know who was there, hmm?
Well, of course, everybody.
The humiliation.
Crown Prince Angelicus of Brandenberg.
He's so well-bred, he doesn't even know what a mouse is.
Fainted dead away.
I haven't slept all night.
Of course, I discharged my entire staff, especially the gardeners.
I'll be struck from the social directory.
A mouse. Hmph.
- Vicar, what a surprise!
- Bless me.
How is your frog?
I mean, your wife.
Oh, the less said about her the better.
I mean, that incident.
Most unfor... for... for... fortunate.
Bless me.
Miss Dolittle, it's my hay fever.
The Bishop of Glastonbury is attending my sermon this evening,
- and it's most important, you understand.
- Of course.
- But my hay... hay...
Oh! Oh! Oh!
But... But... Oh!
- Oh!
- Sir Rupert, I'm so sorry!
Where in the heavens does that woman think she's going?
- Get out of my way, Vicar!
Oh!
Ow!
Oh!
Oh!
Ow!
Oh, let me out of this madhouse!
- Oh! Oh!
- Sir Rupert, I'm so sorry!
Ow!
John!
Yes, Sarah?
I shall give you just five minutes to make up your mind.
Either you get rid of every hideous bird, beast and reptile... in this ridiculous menagerie immediately,
- or I am leaving... today!
- But...
- Five minutes.
- Sarah, I can't just...
Oh, yes, you can just.
I don't think five minutes is very long.
Anybody home?
Oh, come in, Matthew.
Well, l-I didn't know you was having a party.
What are we celebrating?
You know, Matthew, today I made a great discovery.
Oh? What was that then?
I'm a terrible doctor.
I'm probably the worst doctor in the world.
Good for you.
I like a man who knows his worth.
I have absolutely no interest in the health and welfare of my patients.
I can't begin to communicate with them.
I don't even want to communicate with them.
I've come to the conclusion that, with the possible exception of yourself,
I have nothing in common with the human race.
You know, the trouble with you,
John Dolittle, is you prefer animals to people.
But animals are so much more fun than people.
Then be an animal doctor.
- What was that?
- I said, "Be an animal doctor."
Animal doctor?
You know more about animals than anybody I've ever met.
I could get every sick animal within miles to come to you.
Aye, so could I.
At least all the dogs and cats.
All the rich ones, that is.
The Pekes and the poodles.
I could slip a little something into their meat.
Shh, Matthew.
What do you mean?
I mean, there isn't one good animal doctor in the west of England.
Farmer Green's cow was saying only the other day... she just will not have another calf until she gets a decent doctor.
You mean, you spoke to her?
At the Animals' Welfare League.
We meet every Wednesday.
She's chair-cow.
You mean, animals actually talk to one another?
Well, of course, we can.
Do you think we're all dumb?
L... No, no.
I knew parrots could talk.
Parrots are the finest linguists in the animal kingdom.
I speak over 2,000 languages, including dodo and unicorn.
- Unicorn?
- I have a classical education.
Polynesia, could I learn to talk to animals?
I don't see why not.
You're quite intelligent.
Oh, thank you.
If I succeeded, I could become... the greatest animal doctor in the world.
Oh, no question.
Mind you, it isn't easy.
I'm the only parrot in the world... who actually understands what she's talking about.
Well, if you can do it,
I don't see why I shouldn't.
I like your attitude.
Why have I never thought of this before?
Polynesia, I want you to teach me everything you know.
What, 2,000 languages?
Certainly. We'll start at 8:00 tomorrow morning.
But it took me over a hundred years.
Then we'll start at 7:00.
There's not a moment to lose.
Matthew, think what it would mean...
If I could talk to the animals
Just imagine it
Chatting to a chimp in chimpanzee
Imagine talking to a tiger
Chatting to a cheetah
What a neat achievement that would be
If we could talk to the animals
Learn their languages
Maybe take an animal degree
I'd study elephant and eagle buffalo and beagle
Alligator, guinea pig and flea
I would converse in polar bear and python
And I would curse in fluent kangaroo
If people asked me
Can you speak rhinoceros
I'd say, of course-eros
Can't you
If I conferred with our furry friends
Man-to-animal
Think of the amazing repartee
If I could walk with the animals
Talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals
And they could talk to me
If I consulted with quadrupeds
Think what fun we'd have
Asking over crocodiles for tea
Or maybe lunch with two or three lions
Walruses or sea lions
What a lovely place the world would be
If I spoke slang to orangutans
The advantages any fool on Earth could plainly see
Discussing Eastern art and dramas
With intellectual llamas
That's a big step forward
You'll agree
I'd learn to speak in antelope and turtle
My Pekingese would be extremely good
If I were asked to sing in hippopotamus
I'd say, why not-amus and would
If I could parley with pachyderms
It's a fairy tale worthy of Hans Andersen or Grimm
A man who walks with the animals
Talks with the animals
Grunts and squeaks and squawks with the animals
This is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me, Polynesia.
I can't wait to start.
Just the very thing.
For instance, Polynesia, how would I say...
"good morning" to our friend there?
In pig talk, I mean.
That's simple.
- Was that it?
- Why, yes.
It's remarkable.
What was all the leg-shaking business?
That's part of "good morning."
Most animal languages are a mixture of sounds and movements.
A short snort means "good."
Shaking the leg means "morning."
And you... And you just put the two together?
That's right.
Didn't answer me.
No, that's your right leg.
That means "good night."
Oh.
She answered.
Did you see that? She answered.
All I went was...
Did it again.
Good heavens. I speak pig.
Where are we going?
I want to say good morning to every animal in Puddleby.
It's incredible.
It's impossible.
But it's true.
A man can talk to the animals
It's a miracle
In a year from now I guarantee
I'll be the marvel of the mammals
Playing chess with camels
No more just a boring old M.D.
I'll study every living creature's language
So I can speak to all of them on sight
If friends say
Can he talk in crab or pelican
You'll say, like helican and you'll be right
And if you just stop to think a bit
There's no doubt of it
I shall win a place in history
For I can walk with the animals
Talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals
And they can squeak and squawk
And speak and talk
To me
Needless to say, Stubbins,
I've neither seen nor spoken... to dear sister, Sarah, from that day to this.
But I do have the consolation of being able to speak 498 animal languages.
Any one of which is more fun than talking to Sarah.
Four hundred and ninety-eight?
With goldfish, it will be 499.
When you get to 500, Doctor, we ought to have a party.
We must.
You'll need more than languages before we can search for the great pink sea snail.
Voyages cost money, you know.
Mm, quite.
Now, gentlemen, if you'll forgive me, animals are earlier risers than human beings, and I've got to be up at 5:30 to open the clinic.
Good heavens.
You can't go home in that.
Matthew, you can make up a bed here, if you don't mind Gub-Gub snoring.
Stubbins can sleep on the sofa in the library.
Polynesia will go over to your house and tell your parents you're all right.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
He's a genius.
Uh-hum.
I think you're next.
What did you tell her?
To take two of these pills three times a day after meals.
Polynesia, remember that lady owes us a gallon of milk.
- All right, Doctor.
- Now, what next?
This mouse. He has a bent tail.
Oh, it's you again.
Well, that's the third time this week.
What's that machine?
It's a whisker and tail straightener.
My own invention.
These field mice are always getting caught in General Bellowes' pantry... up at the Grange.
Being a military man, he has a regular defense system of mousetraps, and they're all having very narrow escapes, like this one.
There we are.
That should do it. Good as new.
There.
But, uh, keep away from General Bellowes' pantry.
Next.
Good morning, Sheila.
On the desk, please, Stubbins.
Yes, sir.
- Oh, I see.
- What's the matter?
Apparently one of her children have got flat feet.
This one? Yes.
Very dangerous in hunting season.
Can't run fast enough.
I'll work out some form of exercise.
Bum-bum. Bum-bum.
Bum-bum. Something like that.
Anyhow, we'd better see our other patients first.
I can get on with this later.
Good boy, Jip.
Uh-oh.
Ah, Toggle.
Oh, yes, of course.
Toggle's getting a bit shortsighted in his old age.
There now.
We'll just, uh, test these.
Now, I'm sure this will be better than the last time.
Good Lord. That's excellent.
Polynesia, remember
Toggle owes me a free ride... next time I have to go to Plymouth or Penzance.
Yes, Doctor.
What the devil! Emma, I'll murder him if I lay my hands on him!
- That's Bellowes' voice.
- Damn it! What's the matter?
Out of my way!
Out of my way!
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!
There he is.
We've caught him red-handed.
- Emma, you're a witness.
- A witness to what?
The most flagrant display of organized animal stealing... in the history of Puddleby crime.
Organized? I beg...
I am a doctor, sir.
You are a horse thief, sir.
That is my plow horse.
It's no good your trying to disguise him.
He's wearing glasses because he's shortsighted.
I'd recognize him anywhere.
Take them off. At once, sir.
Shortsighted. That won't sound very convincing in front of the magistrate.
- Magistrate?
- I'm prosecuting, and I don't fancy your chances in court.
I'm the magistrate, and if I weren't late for my foxhunt,
I'd report you for cruelty to animals.
Don't you dare lay a finger on her.
- She's one of my patients.
- One of your what?
She's been chased by your wretched foxhounds three times in two weeks.
You've already murdered her husband.
If anything happened to her, these babies are going to be orphans.
It's all right, Sheila.
I won't let him hurt you.
I've never heard... Sheila?
Just the sight of you is enough to give her a heart attack.
Look at her.
She's a complete nervous wreck.
She'll be more than that by the time I'm finished with her!
- You'll never catch her.
- Tallyho!
There are times when the English are rather tiresome.
Bellowes, no!
Out of my way!
- Out of my way! Out of my way!
- Oh, well.
"Never catch her," eh?
What do you think this is?
My horse!
- Where did they come from?
- North America.
We formed an Anglo-American
Fox Protection Society.
Purely volunteer, of course.
Fox Protection Society?
Yes. During the hunting season, a skunk will always run with a fox.
The idea is to put the hounds off the scent.
I never dreamt it would work so well.
- How dare you!
- I beg your pardon?
- General Bellowes...
- He certainly does.
- Is my uncle.
- I'm sorry.
- Is that an apology?
- I'm sorry he's your uncle.
And I'm sorry I'm his niece.
- It must be terrible.
- What do you mean?
Having a name like Bellowes.
- My name is Emma Fairfax.
- Oh, that's a bit better.
What I meant was that if I were his nephew instead of his niece...
If you were his nephew, you'd hardly be called Emma Fairfax.
- If I were a man...
- Fred Fairfax?
I have never in my entire experience... known anyone treat people as appallingly as you do.
I don't treat people, madam.
I treat animals.
You treat people like animals too.
And I have nothing but contempt for people whose idea of pleasure... is to take a defenseless animal and make a social event out of a ritual killing.
- That's it, John Dolittle. You tell her.
- Matthew, I am telling her.
- You make it sound...
- Furthermore...
- Don't keep interrupting me!
- I'm sorry. What did you wish to say?
Oh, I've forgotten!
Very well. Furthermore, I would deem it a favor if in the future... you and your bloodthirsty relatives... would avoid coming here and upsetting the animals.
In any case, I find it hard to believe that a grown man... can waste his entire life playing with animals in the first place.
And I, madam, find it equally hard to believe... that a grown woman could spend her entire life doing absolutely nothing.
You got to admit that for someone called Fred, she's a fair-looking fellow.
If I were a man
I'd scratch his eyes out
I'd tear his hair out by the roots
And kick his shins in with my boots
And I would bite his hand as only I can
If only I could be a man
A great man would not hesitate
To put Dr. Dolittle to death
Attila the Hun
To name only one
Would chuckle at his dying breath
It seems a man can be as rude as he likes
Crude as he likes
Lewd as he likes too
But a girl must be discreet as she can
Sweet as she can
Neat as she can too
But that's not the life
That I want to lead
Normal and formal as homespun tweed
I need the freedom to go
Where I please
But where
Do I please
I don't know
That's the trouble
I don't know
Here I stand at the crossroads of life
Childhood behind me
The future to come
And alone
Nothing planned at the crossroads of life
But life will find me
More grateful than some
It has known
Grateful to see
All the wonderful things I see
Grateful to be
What life expects me to be
So I stand at the crossroads of life
This way or that way
Well, which shall I go
Towards the left or the right
Towards the day or the night
Towards the dark or the light
Only my heart can know
Only my heart
Can know
- What is it?
- Ha. I don't know, Doctor.
It just arrived for ya.
- It's making funny noises.
- Extraordinary-looking thing.
- It's from Tibet.
It's probably that pink sea snail you was lookin' for.
No, it's not big enough for that.
What do you suppose it is?
Well, we could always open it and find out.
Oh, yes. What a good idea.
Ah. Oh, look, it's a llama.
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.
I think he's nervous. Open up the other end and give him a push, Matthew.
Here.
There's another one at this end.
There's two of them.
Two llamas? How thoughtful of somebody.
People are awfully nice.
- What are you going to do with them?
- We could make ourselves... a couple of nice overcoats for a start.
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.
This way, lad. Come on. Come on.
That's a good fella.
I don't believe it. It can't be.
- It is! It is!
- What? What? What?
It's a pushmi-pullyu.
- Look.
- Holy O'Reilly. Forgive me.
I'll never touch another drop.
Stubbins, pat the other end.
They're very timid.
This is without doubt the first one that's ever been captured.
If I had a head at each end,
I'd take a bit of catchin' too.
- What's he saying, Doctor?
- It's rather difficult to understand.
It's a camel dialect with rather a thick accent.
- A message? Oh, a message for me.
- Is this it?
Ah, yes, it's from Long Arrow.
I should have guessed.
Who's he when he's at home?
The greatest naturalist in the world and a very old friend.
- He's a Red Indian gentleman.
- With a name like Long Arrow,
I didn't think he was Irish.
- What's all them drawings, Doctor?
- Picture writing.
It's the only way we can communicate.
You see, this means the pushmi-pullyu is a gift.
The open hand, you see?
For me. That's me.
From his friend, Long Arrow.
To make money to take a ship... to search for great pink sea snail.
Signed Long Arrow.
Oh, that's marvelous.
But tell me, Doctor, how do you make money with a pushmi-pullyu?
I thought it was obvious. Stubbins, what would you do if you had two heads?
- I'd join a circus, sir.
- Exactly.
Excuse me. I'm looking for the proprietor.
You've found him. Albert Blossom.
- Splendid. How do you do?
My name's Dolittle.
- I'm not interested.
- I thought you might like to see a rather unusual...
- No, I wouldn't.
It's probably something you haven't seen before.
I've seen everything before.
- Then you aren't interested?
- That's right. I'm not interested.
Come along, Matthew.
- Sorry to have troubled you. Good day.
- Good day.
- It's a trick.
- No, it's no trick.
Why... But... I've never seen anything like it.
- Neither has anybody else.
- Hey, whoa! I say, come here!
Just a minute.
Hey, hey! I mean, l-I've never seen anything like it.
I mean, I've seen the world
I've been around
I can tell you stories that would quite astound you
I'm not a fool
I went to school
I've been from
Liverpool to Istanbul
Istanbul, I'm no fool
And anyone will tell you that
I'm sharper than a knife
But I've never seen anything like it in my life
- It's a pushmi-pullyu.
- Is it?
Well, I've never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it in my life
- It's the rarest animal on Earth.
- It certainly is!
Hey, hold up a moment. Hey!
I mean, I know the game
I've seen them all
I could tell you stories that would quite enthrall you
I know me job
Pleasin' the mob
I give 'em what they want for just two bob
Just two bob
Well, that's my job
But this is so fantastic
I can't wait to tell the wife
Gertie, you've never seen anything like it in your life
Come on out!
You've never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it
You've never seen anything like it in your life
It's a bicranium, madam.
Arthur! Charlie! Joe!
Come and have a look at this!
Beverly, get Joe!
I thought I'd seen every wonder in the world
I've seen the Colosseum in Rome and the Acropolis
I've made the biggest blunder in the world
'Cause I've never seen anything quite like this
Now look what you've done!
You've frightened him!
Hey, come back! Come back!
I'm down to earth
I'll tell you straight
I could tell you stories that would fascinate you
I know the trade
I know the tricks
I once bought an elephant for two pound six
Two pound six
Taught it tricks
But for your pushmi-pullyu
I'd pay three pounds
Four pounds!
Five!
'Cause I've never seen anything like it that's alive
I tell you what.
I'd even pay for it in cash.
Five? That wasn't exactly what we had in mind.
Because, you see, pushmi-pullyus are remarkable creatures
Of all God's animals they're the cleverest
They develop these remarkable features running up and down Mount Everest
- No!
- Yes! Absolutely true.
Runnin' up and down
Mount Everest?
Exactly. You see...
Running up and down the mountain gives them very nimble feet
Put them on the right rope
They could walk a tightrope
That should give the audience a rare old treat
And this extreme agility begets a rare ability
Shared only with the mountain goats of France
The pushmi-pullyu loves to dance
I'll give you anything you want.
- The terms are quite simple.
- Anything you want!
- Four-week engagement.
- Right!
- Share all profits equally.
- Right.
Two performances a day.
Oh, uh, no, uh, four performances a day.
Just a minute.
We have a problem.
Well, what do they want?
Three shows a day.
And four on Saturday?
They agree.
Done!
La, la-la, la
La, la, la, la, la
- My dear Dolittle!
- Oh, I'm awfully sorry.
You've never seen anything like it!
I've never seen anything like it.
Dolittle, me.
Thank you.
- Me.
- No, Dolittle.
I mean, you're not a fool
Neither am I
I could tell you stories that would stultify you
Open your eyes
What do you see
This thing's a miracle for you and me
Guarantee
I agree
Within a meager month
I've seen my wildest dreams come true
'Cause I've never seen anything like it nor have you
Oh, I've never seen anything like it
Never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it
In all my
Life
What's the matter with you, Sophie?
Come on, Sophie. Catch it.
Try again, Sophie.
Come on, Sophie.
- That's yours.
- Oh, thanks.
Right, well,
I'm off to the bank.
Ah, here we are now. "Seals are notoriously sentimental creatures.
Prolonged separation from those they love can result... in complete lack of interest in their usual activities."
That would explain why Sophie keeps dropping things in her act.
It isn't like her.
I'm sure she's pining for some reason.
I must go and have a chat with her.
This fellow obviously knows what he's talking about.
- Who wrote the book, Doctor?
- Uh, oh, I did.
- Hmm.
- Just a moment!
I have something to say to you,
- Mr. Dolittle.
- Doctor.
Doctor?
I've heard of some hypocrites in my time, but you are contemptible!
All that sanctimonious claptrap about protecting defenseless creatures, and here you are an animal trainer in a cheap circus!
Exhibiting freaks!
Come, lad. Why don't you go and make some cocoa?
- I don't want any cocoa, do you?
- I'd love some, lad. Yes. Off you go.
Hello, Fred.
He is... He's very rude.
Who, the doctor?
Oh, no, not at all. He's a darlin' man.
Did you hear what he said about my uncle?
Oh, that, yeah, well, he's a darlin' man, but he's very rude.
Of course, I wouldn't mind so much except everything he said was true.
You should never believe anybody who goes around tellin' the truth.
They're not to be trusted.
Ya have to do it both ends.
Otherwise it gets jealous.
He was too ashamed to say anything just now, of course.
- Too nice.
- Nice?
He's the kindest man on God's Earth, Fred.
He understands animals better than you and me will ever understand anythin'.
Well, I certainly don't understand him.
Ah, sure, now.
He's one of the beautiful people.
And I'm sure now he's one of the horrible people.
You're wrong, sweetheart.
I can't explain what it is that he is
But he is what he is for a very good reason
I can't explain why he does what he does
But he does what he does
'cause his heart is pure
Of that much
I am sure
I'm sure as I told young Tom the other day
He lives in a world of fantasy
And that is a world
I plan to see, fantasy
Can't you see
The world is full of beautiful things
Butterfly wings
Fairy tale kings
And each new day undoubtedly brings
Still more beautiful things
The world abounds with many delights
Magical sights
Fanciful flights
And those who dream on beautiful nights
Dream of beautiful things
Beautiful days for sunshine lazin'
Beautiful skies and shores
Beautiful days when I can gaze
In beautiful eyes
Like yours
Our lives tick by like a pendulum swings
Poor little things
Puppets on strings
But life is full
Of beautiful things
Beautiful people
Too
Beautiful people
Like
You
I see. I see.
I'm sorry. Hmm.
Ah, cocoa.
Come in, gentlemen.
You know Sophie, don't you?
Oh, yes, of course you do.
It seems we have a problem on our hands.
Sophie's just been telling me how much she misses her husband.
That's why she couldn't concentrate on her performance, just as I thought.
- Where is her husband?
- The North Pole. That's the problem.
They were on their way there when Sophie was captured.
If she doesn't get back to him, she feels she's going to go completely to pieces.
What do you want us to do?
Go to the North Pole?
Unfortunately, there isn't time, but it's very pleasant up there.
But the North Pole hasn't been discovered yet.
Not officially.
I'd never say anything about it.
I promised the polar bears I wouldn't.
Anyway, that's beside the point.
What we've got to do is to get Sophie back to her husband.
Now, if I could get her to the Bristol Channel, she could swim it in about a week.
You go along there, around that bit, then straight on and then slightly to the left.
Oh, that's great, but how does she get to the Bristol Channel?
- Well, she'd have to escape.
- Escape? A seal?
I can hardly go to Blossom and say she wanted to go to the North Pole to see her husband.
He wouldn't believe a word.
- You know something?
- What?
- She's gonna have to escape.
- Tonight.
Shh. Shh.
- Is everything all right, sir?
- It's my grandmother.
She's not very well.
I'm taking her to Bristol.
- Can you smell fish?
- Fish?
It's Granny.
She's on a special diet.
Very wise, sir.
Are you all right, dear?
Enjoying the trip?
Oh, that's good.
Whoa! Whoa!
What's the delay?
What's going on there?
Jack Fitch, the highwayman, has been seen on this road.
We have to search all coaches.
Help yourself.
You'll find no surprise in here.
All right, driver.
All right, get up.
All right, go on.
Come back here, Nelly!
Nelly, come back here!
Where are you going?
Where are you going, Nelly?
Come on back!
Come back here, I tell ya!
Well, here we are. Sorry it was such an uncomfortable journey, but it was really the only way.
There, there, there, Sophie.
Don't get upset.
I can't bear females who cry.
Shh. Don't look at me like that, Sophie, or I'll get upset too.
Dear Sophie, you understand so much, don't you?
When I look in your eyes
I see the wisdom of the world in your eyes
I see the sadness of a thousand good-byes
When I look in your eyes
Shh, shh.
And it is no surprise
To see the softness of the moon in your eyes
The gentle sparkle of the stars in the skies
When I look in your eyes
In your eyes I see the deepness of the sea
I see the deepness
Of the love, the love
I feel you feel for me
Autumn comes, summer dies
I see the passing of the years in your eyes
And when we part, there will be no tears, no good-byes
I'll just look into your eyes
Dear Sophie
Those eyes so wise
So warm, so real
Isn't it a pity you're a seal
Well, she's on her way.
- What did you throw her in for?
- She wanted to go back to her husband.
No, you don't understand at all.
She wasn't a woman. She was a seal.
- A seal?
- Yes.
Dressed in a bonnet and shawl?
That's right. Yes. I'd sort of borrowed it from this lady in the tavern.
The bonnet had a little brown ribbon through...
Never mind about the brown ribbons.
You then took the seal to Bristol in a stagecoach... and upon arrival promptly threw her over a cliff.
Exactly.
May one ask why?
Uh, certainly. Um, she wanted to go to the North Pole to see her husband.
- Her husband?
- Yes.
What makes you think this seal wanted to go to the North Pole?
- Well, she told me.
- She told you?
Yes, we discussed it in great detail.
Are you in the habit of talking to animals?
Yes, I am.
I do it all the time.
I thought perhaps you did.
With all due respect to
Your Worship, I think I detect a note of skepticism in the court.
I would, therefore, like an opportunity... to prove the point by talking to any animal you care to nominate.
Very well then.
My dog Rufus is outside. Bring him in!
Oh, that's very kind of you.
This way, please.
Oh, thank you very much.
Yes, Rufus will be only too happy to answer any questions you care to ask.
Oh, I think we can dispense with that formality.
Uh, ask him what I had for dinner last night.
Very well.
Did he?
Well, really? Did he?
Good Lord. Well, well.
Did he really?
Well, well, well.
What did he say?
I'm grateful that Your Worship acknowledges the fact that the dog was talking.
For dinner last night,
Your Lordship enjoyed the following:
Two helpings of boiled trout, four helpings of roast pheasant, roast potatoes, brussels sprouts and gravy,
Followed by six large portions of blackberry pie with whipped cream.
It's not true! I only had five helpings of blackberry pie!
Your Lordship also drank a great deal of wine and brandy... and later in the evening sang noisy songs with your friends about a woman from Swansea...
That's enough!
The court is adjourned until tomorrow morning, pending inquiries about the bonnet and shawl stolen from the tavern in question.
Hmm. Thank you.
Well, by my calculation, the trial will be over by 11:00 tomorrow morning.
Polynesia, how much did we earn from the circus?
206 pounds, seven and fourpence, halfpenny.
Ah, it's more than enough.
I see no reason why we shouldn't set out to find the pink sea snail right away.
Matthew, go to the house and pick up my clothes.
Have the boat ready to sail by 12:00.
We'll catch the noontide or whatever it's called.
We haven't got a crew, so we'll have to make due with you and Stubbins and the animals.
I can come too?
If your parents say so and you know how to tie a knot.
Hear that? We're going to help the doctor find the pink sea snail.
I should wait until you see his boat before you get too excited.
It isn't by chance it's called the Flounder.
No sailor in his right mind would touch it.
I'm not asking a sailor in his right mind. I was asking you.
What do you say?
I say that for a man who's about to be hanged for murder... to be gettin' ready to go on a pleasure cruise shows a very nice outlook.
- Fred!
- To what do we owe this, uh, pleasure?
- I've brought dinner.
- Dinner?
- Yes, for Matthew and Tommy.
- Oh.
Set it down there, Hubert.
Steak and kidney pie and oxtail and roast beef.
- Would you like some?
- Uh, no.
Oh, come on, Doctor.
Ya haven't had a bite all day.
- No, thank you.
- He's a vegetarian.
Oh, no!
It, uh, seems a pity to waste it.
It's all right, Matthew.
Um, carry on.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Come on, Tom.
Doctor?
Um, Rufus was right.
He did have six helpings of blackberry pie.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you, Chee-Chee.
It seems that a bonnet and shawl were, in fact, removed... from the tavern in question on the day in question.
The lady who owns them, for reasons best known to herself, has no wish to prosecute.
You are, therefore, acquitted of the charge of murder.
Thank you very much.
However, your performance in this courtroom in the past two days... has left little doubt in the minds of my distinguished colleagues and myself... that your lunatic activities with animals infringe upon the public safety... and are not to be tolerated.
Happily, Her Majesty's farseeing benevolence provides a sanctuary for sad people like you... who think they can talk to animals and want to treat them like human beings.
Therefore, it is the judgment of this court... that you be committed indefinitely to an asylum for the insane.
Have you anything to say?
I do not understand the human race
It has so little love for creatures
With a different face
Treating animals like people is no madness or disgrace
I do not understand the human race
I wonder why do we treat animals like animals
Animals treat us so very well
The devoted way they serve us and protect us when we're nervous
Oh, they really don't deserve us
All we give them is hell
Tell me how else man repays them
Do we ever think to praise them, no, we don't
And this dismays them
You can tell
We are riddled with ingratitude
We give no love or latitude
In every way our attitude is well, like animals
No, no. That's not what I mean. I mean...
Why do we treat animals like animals
How can people be so inhumane
Cows and chickens work to feed us
Dogs and horses show they need us
And though cats don't always heed us their affection is plain
What do we do, we neglect them
We do nothing to protect them
We reject them
Don't expect them to complain
We ignore them or we beat them
When we're hungry then we eat them
It's appalling how we treat them, it's insane
Like animals
We humiliate and murder and confine them
We create their wretched status
Then we use it to malign them
I mean, why should we say
Treat him like a dog
Why should we say
Working like a horse
Why should we say
Eating like a hog
When what we mean is
Eating like a man
Don't we, of course
A man of ill repute is called a weasel or a rat
A woman you dislike becomes a vixen or a cat
A family that is blessed with healthy reproductive habits
Occasions the remark, well, you know them, they breed like rabbits
He's as stubborn as a mule
He's as stupid as an ox
He's as slimy as a snake
He's as crafty as a fox
Remarks like that really get my goat
Why don't we say
Noble as a frog
Or why can't we say
Wealthy as a hen
True, we say
Devoted as a dog
What we should say is
Chic as a giraffe
Pretty as a pig, eh
That will be the big day, won't it
But when, but when
But when, when will we stop treating them like animals
Is the human race entirely mad
Women see a baby goatskin or a lambskin or a stoatskin
And to them it's just a coatskin
Oh, it's terribly sad
When you dress in suede or leather or some fancy fur or feather
Do you stop and wonder whether for a fad
You have killed some beast or other
That you're wearing someone's brother
Or perhaps it's someone's mother in which you're clad
Like animals
Like animals
Like animals
Well, it's true
We do not live in a zoo
But man is an animal too
So why can't you
Like me
Like animals
Animals
Now, the prison faces the road here.
So what we do is we tie the ropes from the bars of the cell to the elephant, and he pulls the whole wall off.
How can you go on the voyage if the doctor's still in prison?
We can't. That's why Matthew's got this marvelous plan to get him out.
Then this second elephant... he's bigger than the first elephant...
All the doctor has to do is step through the hole in the wall onto his back.
- You'll never get away with this.
- Listen, here's the clever part.
He slides down the elephant's trunk onto a waitin' rhinoceros and away they go!
Just the three of you are going off on this boat?
Oh, no. Chee-Chee, Polynesia and Jip are coming too.
Then there's these six tigers, you see, to stop anyone followin'.
To look for a pink sea snail?
They'll be standing on the other side of the road while I'm settin' off the dynamite.
- Dynamite?
- Oh, sure.
If we blow up the road, they'll have to go all the way around the town to get to the harbor, which gives me time to nip back here... and blow up the bridge while you're gettin' on the boat.
That's the beauty of this whole plan... its simplicity.
- Are they really going to keep the doctor in prison?
- Oh, no, no.
They're moving him across to the loony bin at 12:00.
- Today?
- Aye.
I've also an idea.
You get the boat ready.
Leave the doctor to me.
We sail at 12:00. Avast now.
Aye, aye, sir.
We're a fine bunch, takin' orders from a parrot.
Matthew, how did you enjoy the food I brought you in the prison the other night?
'Twas the best meal
I ever had in me life.
They say that prison food is terrible.
I won't hear a word against it.
I was thinking.
Wouldn't it be nice if you were to have those kind of meals on your voyage?
Oh, true now.
It would be marvelous.
The only way we could do that is if you was to...
If we was to, uh...
Ah!
I'll tell you one thing, Fred.
I only hope there's no stowaways on that boat.
Because if there was,
I wouldn't know where to look for them.
Anyway, once we're out at sea with an escaped convict, there's no turnin' back.
Oh, Matthew!
I love you!
Who would have thought that one little kiss
Soft and sweet from the lips of a lovely girl
Would to change my life
But by my life
It will
After today nothing will be the same again
After today I'll make my claim to fame and then
The grass will be greener
And the air will be cleaner
And my life be serener
Than heaven knows when
Heaven knows when
After today I shall have bid my fears good-bye
After today I shall have no more tears
To cry
I'll learn to live with laughter to stay
After
Today
After today nothing will be the way it was
After today I'll say
Oh, what a day it was
My heart will be lighter
And my smile will be brighter
And I'll be twice the fighter
That ever I was
Clever because
After today I shall have bid my fears farewell
After today I shall have no more tears
To quell
I'll learn to live with laughter
To stay
After the tears comes the laughter
After today
Chee-Chee.
Run! Run!
Stop!
Don't follow the doctor!
Don't obey! Don't obey!
Right!
Come on! This way!
Don't sit down!
- Get up!
- After them!
Go after him!
This way. Come on. After him. This way.
- This way! No, this way!
- Ta-ta.
- Stop them!
- Stop them! Stop them!
It's all right, Doctor.
You can come out now.
- There's not a policeman in sight.
- Oh, thank you, Matthew.
Makes a very good little reading room, this. I must use it more often.
Now, let's see where we are.
Ah, I see.
He says there's a faint smell of garlic coming from the southeast.
- What does that mean?
- It means we're about ten miles off the coast of France.
I've got about the best navigational system on the high seas today.
Jip's got this incredible sense of smell, and Polynesia gets marvelous weather reports from the passing birds and fishes.
- Everything all right at the house?
- Yes, Doctor.
Good. Keep an eye on everything and don't bump into anything like Ireland.
Aye, aye, Doctor.
- A very well organized escape.
Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
I doubt if there's a ship afloat with flowers like these.
Look at these geraniums.
Absolutely glorious.
Have you seen my azaleas on the starboard side?
- No, sir, I can't say as I have.
- They're doing wonderfully.
How are you enjoying life on the rolling deep?
If the good Lord meant us to take to water, He'd have given us flippers.
No, Stubbins, move your mouth about more.
You must reread my essay on basic chimpanzee, page one.
I must cut these roses back.
There's so much to do on a ship.
What a marvelous smell, Matthew.
What have you been cooking?
I'm absolutely starving.
Will this do?
Do come on while it's still hot.
What are you doing here?
I thought someone capable ought to look after Tommy on the voyage.
Stubbins is perfectly capable of looking after himself.
I must turn the ship around and go straight back to Puddleby... uh, well, immediately after lunch.
They'll, uh... They'll put ya inside if you go back, Doctor.
Oh, yes, that is a point.
What are we going to do with her if she stays?
You make me sound like a stray cat.
A cat would be most welcome.
Don't worry. It's vegetarian.
- It's delicious.
- It's marvelous.
Mmm. What is it?
- Algue marine en croute.
- Oh, yes.
- What's that in English?
- Seaweed pie.
Mmm! It's really rather good.
- Well, where are we going?
- To hunt for the great pink sea snail.
And where do you expect to find it?
I haven't the faintest idea.
But as one place is as good as another, it's high time we decided.
- Otherwise, when we get there, we won't know we've arrived.
- Good thinking.
- Thank you.
- Are your voyages always as well planned as this?
When possible. Unfortunately, one doesn't always have time to go into minute details.
- Such as knowing where you're going?
- That sort of thing.
But then how do you decide?
We play a little game I invented.
One of us opens the atlas at random, sticks a pin in the open page.
Wherever it lands, that's where we go.
- You can't be serious.
- I'm very serious.
That is the most ridiculous thing
I have ever heard of.
You could end up in all sorts of terrible places.
That's absolutely true.
I remember going to the Sahara Desert four times in succession... before I realized Chee-Chee had stuck down all the other pages of the atlas with jam.
Marvelous trips. Lots of sand.
But that is exactly what I mean.
It's all right now. I cleaned all the jam off. Little bit there.
How you can sit there and say what you're saying I just don't know.
I must admit the Sahara is one place
I'm praying we just won't go.
You know, that's absolutely typical of a woman.
There are so many fabulous faraway places to see
She makes one seaweed pie and goes mad.
Such as Mexico, Sweden
Hawaii, Japan and Capri
Who does she think she is?
There's so many exciting and wonderful places
Much more inviting than desert oases
Pleasant as home is it isn't what Rome is
So why stay there
When there are so many fabulous faraway places to see
As though the seaweed pie was all that marvelous.
Why should Spain and Tahiti and Rio
- Just be only names to you and me
- Is there any more?
I feel certain there are people we'd be glad to know there
So tell me why don't we get up and go there
Go to those fabulous places where we long to be
Go to Bangkok and Hong Kong and Paris and Venice
Tokyo and Cairo and Lisbon and London
Wonderful, fabulous places
We're longing to see
When I think of the warm Caribbean
I see a new world for you and me
I'd give anything just to have one single day there
Once we get there
I know that we'll stay there
Stay in those fabulous places where we long to be
-  Such as Siam
-  Sienna
-  Vienna
-  Verona
- Java, Jamaica
- Jamaica, Bombay
-  Barcelona
- Ole!
- Ole! Ole! Ole!
- El toro!
- Ha, ha!
- Ole! Ole! Ole!
Show me those fabulous places
I'm longing to see
My dear Miss Fairfax, you seem to have entirely missed the point.
I'm aware there are fabulous places wherever we sail
- Will we see them?
- We will.
But the point of the journey is science and finding the snail
An incomparable thrill
We shall question the sharks off the coast of Tobago
Interview swamp life in Tierra del Fuego
-  That sounds horrendous
-  No, no, it's tremendous and well worthwhile
We'll make detailed inquiries of every crustacean we meet
- Crustacean?
-  Shellfish, they're sweet
We will sail to the ends of the earth
Till our search for the snail is quite complete
We'll interrogate beetles and bugs in Nigeria
And if we have to spend weeks in Siberia
Eighty below but a place that we all ought to see
But I haven't brought the right clothes for Siberia
Those are the fabulous places you'll visit with me
Sounds as if we're in for a good time.
Well, Siberia is one place you'll never see me go
Stick in the pin
Where the pins goes, then we go
- Ireland!
- Romania!
- No, Ruritania!
We'll chase that sea snail from here to Tasmania
Show me those fabulous places
I'm longing to
I'm longing to
See
It doesn't count.
You landed in the sea.
No, she hasn't. Look. There.
Well, that doesn't look very interesting.
- What is it?
- "Sea Star Island.
Last reported position."
Last reported position?
What can that mean?
The Sea Star Island. That's faintly familiar. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
"Seashore, sea slug, sea snail.
Sea Star Island."
It's that floating island.
It moves all over the world like a ship.
It's a freak of nature.
This time of year it's sometimes sighted off the coast of Africa.
How terribly exciting.
I think you have chosen rather well.
I don't think it's exciting at all.
Couldn't we go to...
Couldn't we go to Monte Carlo?
Miss Fairfax, this is a serious zoogeographical expedition.
It's not a pleasure cruise for your personal benefit.
I promise to ask for no special privileges.
I promise to grant none.
A ship is no place for a woman.
The simple answer then is to treat me like a man.
I intend to.
Well, good-bye.
Twelve.
Uh-huh. How is the score, Stubbins?
And the arithmetic?
You're winning, sir, I think.
Ah, well, that's the first sure sign we've been at sea too long.
Polynesia spoke to some swallows.
They said there's a terrific storm up ahead. Isn't that marvelous?
No, it isn't.
Can't we drive round it?
I shouldn't think so.
The latest long-range fish forecast wasn't too encouraging.
Jip said he could smell thunder.
- I didn't know thunder had a smell.
- It does if you're a dog.
Uh, 82. Mind you,
Jip does tend to exaggerate.
If you ask me, bein' at sea is very much the same as bein' in prison, except at sea ya stand a better chance of drownin'.
That reminds me. One of the ship's rats came to see me this afternoon.
Said he had a distinct tingle in his tail, a sure sign the ship was going down.
So his lot are preparing to leave, according to rat tradition.
He highly recommended we should do the same.
There's nowhere we can go.
- Exactly. That's what I told the rat.
- Two.
- What was that?
- A bit of lightning. That's all.
When you finish clearing up, you better batten down the hatches and stay below.
Women are always scared stiff of storms.
Well, I'm not.
I'm a man, remember?
I dread to think what this is going to do to my azaleas.
August 10.
Signs of inclement weather.
Crew's morale remains high.
Steady as she goes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, indeed.
- Any sign of her, Polynesia?
- Not yet.
Ah, good morning, Stubbins.
Beautiful day.
Yes, sir, good morning.
What happened to the ship?
Very good question.
If we ever find enough bits, we'll put them together and find out.
Come on, Matthew.
Rise and shine.
I told ya Flounder was a terrible name for a boat.
Nonsense. The flounder's a most reliable little fish.
It's survived the sea for thousands of years.
Aye, below the surface.
Anyway, we're all safe.
That's the main thing.
- At least, we will be as soon as we find Miss Fairfax.
- Poor Fred.
I said all along a ship was no place for a woman.
Heaven knows I did my best to make the voyage pleasant for her.
You can't spend your life running after a woman, waiting on her hand and foot when there's important work to be done.
I think under the circumstances
I treated her very well.
Probably too well.
Spoiled her, in fact.
And I tied her very securely to that raft.
I hope she's all right.
That's all.
- We'll make a full-scale search as soon as we get ashore.
- Ashore?
Sea Star Island.
That's where we're going, isn't it?
Apart from the fact that we're shipwrecked, that we have no means of gettin' there, and that we don't know where it is anyway, yes.
You mustn't worry about things like that, Matthew.
By my calculations, we were sort of coming down in this direction like this, and the floating island was sort of coming down in that direction like that.
Then we sort of somehow or other sort of more or less meet... somewhere round about here.
Is that a fact?
Ah! There it is now.
Well, shall we go ashore?
Giddyap.
I must remember to get meself one of those.
Hmph. Any sign of Fred?
Not yet. I only hope she caught the island.
It won't be passing here again for months.
You and Stubbins search the beaches.
I'll go inland.
- Meet back here in two or three hours.
- Yeah. Tommy?
Polynesia, I want every living creature on this island looking for that girl.
Yes, Doctor.
- Every bird that can fly I want airborne until she's found.
- Yes, Doctor.
She can't be at sea.
We'd have heard from the fish by now.
- You sure she'll be all right, Polynesia?
- Yes, Doctor.
She's standing right behind you.
Good morning.
Oh, good morning.
Um, afraid we had a bit of a storm last night.
Thank you for telling me.
Pity you got lost. You could have given us a hand getting these ashore.
I'm sorry. I was fully occupied getting myself ashore.
No mind. We managed. Some of these books are very heavy though.
Saved all your books, I see.
- Yes, most fortunate.
- You lost all my dresses.
Yes, most unfortunate. I saw your trunk floating amongst the wreckage.
However, the outfit you're wearing this morning... is the nicest thing I've seen you in since you left England.
This is my underwear.
Oh. Anyway, it suits you.
I'm terribly glad to see you.
Are you?
Uh, well, we got a tremendous lot to do.
We've got to unload the raft, find food and build whatever it is one has to build.
- What are you trying to say?
- Hmm?
Why don't you say what you mean?
What do you mean, say what I mean?
For a month or more
I have listened and dreamed
While the moon has glistened and a million stars have gleamed
-  Waiting
- Waiting?
-  Waiting
- What for?
What for?  For a man
I know who is clever and kind
But a man who never ever seems to know his mind
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting for you to say you like me
Or hate me or miss me or kiss me or something
But nothing
Nothing do you say
At all
Little wonder I feel sorely neglected
Unwanted, rejected and small
Little more than two feet tall
Lucky to be here
At all
Emma?
I think I... like you.
Yes, I think I do.
I think I like you.
I'm almost sure that I do
I think I like the way you look
The way your eyes reveal your mind
Like a precious book that's hard to find
I think I'm learning something strange and new
But it's well worth learning
Because I'm learning about you
Like dawning sunshine
When a new day is due
I think I like you
And I think you like me too
Do you?
Do you?
Do you?
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.
Good heavens. I do believe that's a great crested oriental moonbird.
It's terribly rare.
I'm so glad we came.
Great crested oriental moonbird.
What a bit of luck.
Ah, that's better.
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.
The locals aren't a very friendly lot, are they?
I bet you anything you like they're going to kill us.
Whoever said children had beautiful minds had obviously never met you.
Bein' in prison is much the same as bein' on a boat, except in prison there's less chance of drownin'.
And less chance of our getting back to Puddleby.
I must have a serious talk to whoever runs this place.
I promised to get Stubbins home in time to go to school.
I'm sure if you tell them that we'll be out of here in no time.
Give me a leg up.
I want to see what's going on out there.
Good heavens.
All right, Matthew. Down.
- Why is it so cold?
- It's like being back in England.
There's a bit of frost. That's all.
It's quite clear what happened.
The storm that sank the Flounder must have blown the island off its usual course.
We're drifting too far north.
If we don't do something about it, that marvelous vegetation is going to die of frostbite.
To say nothin' of our dear selves.
This is obviously the gentleman to talk to.
Good morning.
Me Dr. Dolittle.
Search for great pink sea snail.
Small boy late for school.
Here very cold.
They all go home
Puddleby, yes?
What a funny accent.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Actually, that's what
I came to see you about.
My name is William Shakespeare, the Tenth. You may call me Willie.
Come with me, please.
Thank you.
We've had lots of shipwrecks, of course.
Being a floating island does tend to make us a bit of a danger to shipping.
We've bumped into lots of things over the years.
But on the credit side, it enabled us to build a marvelous museum... and public library... books and art treasures from all over the place.
Everybody on the island speaks nine or ten languages.
We even name our children after our favorite authors.
That's why my name is William Shakespeare.
Do forgive this paraphernalia.
We're rehearsing now
The Merchant Of Venice for our Shakespeare drama festival.
- Do sit down. Milk or lemon?
- Milk, please.
Must be a near perfect civilization.
Then what are we doin' in prison?
Purely a precaution, old boy, a sort of quarantine.
Most of the white men who have come here in the past... usually started killing people before they've been introduced.
- Extraordinary. Help yourself to sugar.
- Thank you.
But they never stay long.
They can't stand the peace and quiet.
I love peace and quiet, but unfortunately we won't be able to stay long either.
We've got to continue our hunt for the great pink sea snail.
You haven't by any chance heard of it being in the vicinity?
At the moment you have a bigger problem than looking for snails.
According to popular superstition, newcomers to the island are responsible for all our misfortunes.
So the elders of the village are blaming you for this frost.
I don't know what we can do about that. Perhaps there is something I can think of.
I do hope so for your sake.
You see, it's written here in the law book.
"He who brings sunshine to the coldness of our days... shall bask in the splendor of a thousand summers."
- That's very nice.
- Yeah.
Yes, but it goes on.
"He who brings winter into the summer of our lives... shall die the death of a thousand screams."
- Oh.
- I prefer the first one.
Yes, so did I.
The elders are also blaming you for what's happened to the animals.
What has happened to the animals?
They've all caught colds.
They're coughing and sneezing all over the place.
I must do something about this immediately. Come along, Polynesia.
We've got work to do.
Bless you.
Gesundheit.
Ha.
Here you are, Tommy. Another little baby lion for you to take care of.
Yes, sir.
Bless you.
That inhalant seems to be working very well.
Bless you.
I was hoping this mustard bath would work.
Still very hot.
How soon will my cough mixture be ready?
- Five minutes. Smell.
- Mmm!
I'd give it to the baby elephant first, if I were you.
- Why?
- She's got a terrible cold.
I want to control it before she gives it to the family.
When a herd of elephants start sneezing, it's like a hurricane.
Might drive the island even further off course. Thank you very much.
If we was to point them in the right direction, perhaps they could blow us back on course.
Pretty good theory, but terribly difficult to organize.
If elephants could swim, one good shove... and we'd be back in a southerly current before we could...
Why didn't I think of that before?
- They can swim.
- What, elephants?
No, no, no, Matthew. Tommy, what's as big as an elephant that can swim?
A whale, sir.
Exactly.
Emma, get on with the cough mixture.
Bless you.
Now, how do you get in touch with a whale?
I'll talk to him immediately.
Splendid.
Good morning. Marvelous, if the giraffe doesn't mind.
Extremely kind of you.
I do appreciate it.
Bless you.
You'll explain? Good.
Here he comes.
It was very decent of that turtle to put us in touch with him.
My word! He's a big fellow.
Now, if he gave a shove below us, that should just about do the trick.
Good morning.
One... shove... here.
We really must learn to speak a few words of whale.
Apparently they're very nice, but nobody ever talks to them.
Look!
Why is it doing that?
The island is bound to roll a bit after that shove.
It set that balancing rock in motion.
- It'll soon calm down.
- That would be highly desirable.
It says here in the law book,
"He who causes the great rock to fall into the hot mountain... shall die the death of 10,000 screams."
- Uh, how many screams did you say?
I shouldn't have thought it was worth more than five.
- I cannot tell you how upset I am about this.
- You're upset?
We realize it isn't your fault.
I've been through the law book from cover to cover.
There is nothing I can do.
- This is the tradition.
- Oh, well, we hate to break a tradition.
I once heard a story about a tribe that burned people alive, then et them for dinner.
I bet that's what they're going to do to us.
Will you please put a curb on your lurid imagination?
I'm sorry about this, Emma.
It hasn't been very relaxing the last few days, has it?
I think we've bumped into something.
Stop!
Release them!
Holy Pat.
What did we do now?
We've collided with the mainland.
The two pieces fit perfectly.
- How extraordinary.
- Not really.
The oldest legend of the island has always maintained... that we are a bit of Africa that has been missing for 5,000 years.
Is there a reward for finding it?
Oh, indeed, yes.
"He who brings back the lost island from the sea... shall live as a god for a thousand moons."
Thank you. Thank you.
That's very pleasant, but if you will excuse me,
I must get back to the hospital, in case the elephant sneezes and blows all the other patients away.
What will you do when the animals are all well again?
I have one great ambition.
I came to find a great pink sea snail.
I intend to find it.
The great pink sea snail is more than mythical.
I always thought that, too, Willie.
No, no. You can see the animals as they come out.
- Guard the gate, Matthew.
- Oh!
Come on. Come on.
- Why does he have the animals in there?
- All right, all right.
I'll tell ya.
Behind these gates is the most wonderful place in all the world.
- Can we see it?
- Can we see it?
- Shh!
- Shh!
This is the world of Dr. Dolittle
The wonderful world of Dr. Dolittle
Where crocodiles talk and elephants sing
And animals do most any old thing
Where polar bears wear top hats
And leopards with spots wear spats
Well, that's life in the world of Dr. Dolittle
Doves start to coo when they see Dolittle
He has a profound philosophy
If animals can be friends says he
Well, then why can't we
Matthew, open the gate.
Come on, baby. Up!
See they're all right, Matthew.
Say how do you do to the world of Dr. Dolittle
Say how do you do to the world of Dr. Dolittle
Life is a zoo to Dr. Dolittle
Life is a zoo to Dr. Dolittle
Where antelopes lope
-  And ostriches fan
-  And ostriches fan
And kangaroos do what kangaroos can
To make the hyenas laugh
As long as a long giraffe
Every calf starts to moo when they see Dolittle
Even the few who used to moo little
For all of the birds and beasts agree
He has a profound philosophy
And so why can't
We.
All of the birds and beasts agree
He has a profound philosophy
And so why can't we
Do little things to help them
Why
Can't
We
Oh.
Well, thank goodness they only had head colds.
Think how terrible it would have been if they'd had sore throats.
Our last two patients.
Well done, Emma.
Well, not a sniffle left on the island.
Interesting noise. Can't be.
You mean, the great pink sea snail...
Precisely, and by the sound of it, he seems to have caught a chill too.
So sorry.
I've never seen anything like it.
- Yes, I see.
Well, just a minute. Amazing!
- What is?
We've been searching for weeks for the great snail.
He's been with us all the time.
Lives in an underground cave and moves about with the island.
I was quite right. He's got a shocking cold. I told him I was a doctor, and if he'd come on the beach,
I'd mix him a batch of my special tonic.
It'll need to be rather large, won't it?
What's that?
- What is it?
- He's purring.
Thrilled with his medicine. Feels much more relaxed, almost like a new snail.
- Wanted to know if there's anything he can do for us.
- Is there?
Yes, he can take you all safely back to Puddleby.
Oh, well. Well, that's a bit of an imposition.
Puddleby's a long way away. All you did was give him a little medicine.
He's 2,000 years old.
He's lonely. It'll be company for him.
He'd been planning to visit his cousin in Scotland for 300 years and put it off.
Be a great opportunity for him.
- His cousin in Scotland?
- You've heard of the Loch Ness monster?
- Yes.
- Well, it's a cousin.
- Good heavens.
- Travel under the sea?
But it's bad enough on top.
We'd all drown, Doctor.
No, the shell is completely watertight.
It'll be like traveling in a big pink bubble.
Yes, he says he can get you back to Puddleby by two weeks from Tuesday.
This must be the only snail in the world with four bedrooms.
Oh, and, Polynesia, don't forget to remind the snail to surface twice a day for his cough mixture.
It will fix up his cold, and stretch your legs and get some sea air.
- Yes, Doctor.
- Oh, good.
I'd hate to miss my turn on deck.
And, Chee-Chee, don't eat all the bananas. Leave some for the others.
Shh, shh. Don't be sad.
That's all, sir.
Good-bye, Stubbins.
Go up to the house whenever you like.
Yes, sir. And, Doctor, come home soon, sir.
Well...
Well, I'll, uh... I'll send your other high hat back from Puddleby, Doctor.
The snail can bring it back with him.
Yours is looking a little grubby now.
You'll probably find it a bit difficult to get one here.
Yes, uh, probably.
Well, thank you, Matthew.
Well, uh, good-bye.
Bye.
Uh, give my love to everyone at home, to Gub-Gub and Dab-Dab and everyone.
Good-bye, John Dolittle.
Take care!
Well, Tom, I still wish he was comin' with us.
I've never driven one of these things before.
Sure you won't change your mind and come with us?
I can't, Emma. Your uncle will put me away the moment I set foot in Puddleby.
But you have to come back one day.
I hope so. A lot of animals depend on me.
One or two people too.
Puddleby's going to seem very dull after all this excitement.
I mean, what are you going to do here?
I think I'll start planning my next voyage.
Where are you going this time? The moon?
- Very probably, yes.
- You're not serious.
- Oh, yes.
- How?
On the giant lunar moth.
Magnificent creature.
Flies backwards and forwards between the earth and the moon.
When it reaches one, it's attracted by the light of the other and flies back again.
Willie tells me there's one on the island.
My idea is to build some sort of saddle arrangement,
- very secure, so I don't fall off halfway.
- Can I come?
Hmm?
Can I come with you?
Emma, I'm afraid...
I'm not very good with people.
L... I'm all right with animals, but people...
I'm not very good with.
I never have been.
I don't know why.
I'll write to you.
I'll organize an air postal service with the seagulls.
I'll miss you, John Dolittle.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, Tom.
If we ever drown in this thing, it'll be in a flood of tears.
Sophie. What are you doing here?
No. Oh, how do you do, sir?
Really? Good Lord.
Sophie, that's marvelous news.
Thank you very much, indeed.
Good-bye, Sophie.
Thank you. Thank you!
"Good night, sweet Prince, and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest."
Willie! Willie!
Wonderful news.
Sophie, the seal, and her husband have come to tell me... all the animals in England are on strike.
They refuse to do any work until I'm reprieved.
- You can go home?
- Yes. The local magistrate is begging me to go back.
The whole country's paralyzed without the animals.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.
I think that tree is about the right size.
It's a 60-foot overall wingspan.
- But you've missed the snail.
- I've got a better idea.
I'm going to fly home.
Can you imagine their faces when they see me on the quayside waiting for them in Puddleby?
- Fly home?
- Since you say there's one on the island, on the lunar moth.
- Help me make a model so I can gauge where to put the saddle.
- Certainly.
I've got to allow for a very steep rate of climb.
Now, you see, you'll be the wings.
All of you. That's it.
Just sit down inside those lines I've just drawn.
Everybody. That's the idea.
Good. Yes, I think it's going to work splendidly.
As soon as I've built this saddle, we'll go and have a chat with the lunar moth.
I only hope he understands common house moth. That's all I speak.
Then as soon as the moon comes up, we'll be off to Puddleby.
Wonderful night for flying.
By my calculations I should be home in time for breakfast.
The stars are made of lemon drops
The bigger ones are lollipops and ice
The clouds have shops up on the tops
That sell you sweets and soda pops
What do they call the place
Isn't it paradise
Maybe what the doctor tells me
Isn't altogether true
But I know every tale he tells me
I don't know any better ones
Do you
My friend the doctor says the world is full of fantasy
And who are you and I to disagree
Let's hope and pray that is the way
The life we love will always stay
For my friend the doctor
And me
THE WOLF WOMAN
- Professor Fernández.
- Yeah.
Come in.
- Dr. Bernstein!
- Prof. Fernández!
- Are you surprised to see me?
- Pleasantly surprised.
Why don't you sent me a letter saying you would come?
I decided to come at the last minute.
I had no time to warn you.
Come in.
Come in, please.
Are you returning from some medical congress?
I'm so far away from everything that I don't know anything of what's happening outside.
No. I came exclusively to talk to you.
- With me?
- Yes, professor.
- Do you have any trouble?
- No.
I came to ask you the hand of your daughter Clarissa.
Our relationship began when you was in Europe.
We decided to keep our love in secret, but...
I love her, and I came here to ask her to marry me.
- What about her?
- She wrote me, giving in to my requests.
I'm sure you would accept it.
- Are you upset, sir?
- No, no!
It was something so unexpected that...
Will you spend a few days with us,
I suppose?
Yes, of course.
It needs to reflect on those decisions.
- Such precipitation would be dangerous.
- Dangerous?
Dangerous for happiness, of course.
Who could have killed them?
I don't understand. They opened the chest and tore the heart.
It's disgusting!
Any conclusions, doctor?
Well, these two are with open chest... and the third one has deep wounds... if someone tried to tear your heart as well.
Maybe the killer had not time, or something.
Maybe.
He tried to defend himself when it was attacked or tried to escape!
What the hell could have happened?
Why don't you stay here?
We would work together.
You could continue with your research here.
And your presence would be helpful in my studies about... metaplasia.
There's blood here.
Certainly she dug her nails into the body of her attacker and bled it.
With a sample of this blood we shall know who or what attacked them.
But how?
Each species has a different type of blood.
Examining at the microscope we shall know... what scale its logic belongs.
- We'll have to send it to the city?
- Oh, no.
In the Prof. Fernandez's lab we can do it.
Here we have a witness that may determinate the killer.
A sample of his own blood.
This microscope is one of the best that's available.
Look.
An authentic operating room.
I use it in interventions in small invertebrates.
As you can see, I got the best and most modern equipment.
Oh, and the most important thing!
This door.
I call it chamber of miracles.
And this is the result of my job.
All these beings are alive.
They were sharply frozen... suspending the cellular process and leaving it static.
Opting for the disintegration of life.
We couldn't say they're sleeping.
Their lives are in my hands.
But I could thaw them I return them back to life, if I want.
Could you tell me what kind of studies I'm doing, Dr. Bernstein?
No.
Mutations of nature.
The metamorphosis of the cells.
They're all equal and all succeed themselves.
[Translation missing] and others, something different, like a moth?
Knowing the answer, I could tell why a living being... can become another one completely distinctive to its species.
So distinct as...
Let's say...
A wolf.
Who's there?
It's me, Mom.
Open the door!
Full moon?
And what's the relation with the studies you've been performing?
So many.
The influence of the moon exerts great power over the cellular activity.
And that's when you can appreciate... the mystery of its wonderful job.
Here are all the notes about my experiments.
Any problem?
No problem, Sir.
You can rest now.
What a strange guy.
Who is he?
Crumba.
He's like a watchdog.
A gypsy who camped around here.
Once I saved his life and now he has a debt with me.
A dream?
In fact, a nightmare.
It's horrible.
It happens almost every night.
I get out of my bed and I can't sleep anymore.
What you dream about?
I'm running through the woods... at night...
I feel that someone comes and I hide myself.
Someone is after me.
I feel an uncontrollable rage.
I go out and...
Everything becomes confused.
I see my hands full of blood.
- I don't know, that's why I ignore it!
- But I have to know!
- Is it something related to my dream?
- Please!
Why do you keep me and my sister locked up?
- Say it!
- It's your father's orders.
I can't stand this situation!
It has to be some reason!
If your father order it,
I have to obey.
You know him.
Never give explanations to anyone.
It's ok.
But it seems instead of a house, we live in a prison!
- What's the problem? It's her again?
- Leave me alone!
[Missing translation]
- She is crazy.
- Don't talk about your sister like that.
Dr. Bernstein is downstairs with your father.
Alejandro!
- I thought you wouldn't come.
- Yeah, I was just a little late.
Metaplasia. The transformation of a tissue to another.
Isn't amazing?
Yes, it's fascinating.
I must confess that I'm studying something similar.
Also breaks with all scientific conventions.
- Lycanthropy?
- Yes.
The transformation of a man into a wolf.
Or a woman in wolf.
Science denies the existence of the lycanthropy.
Conceptualizes it as something unreal.
- Do you have the same opinion?
- No.
Because I have powerful reasons to believe it.
It goes much further than a mere study about a disease.
Disease?
No, professor.
The lycanthropy goes far beyond the pathological concepts.
Science never could explain it... because this is a mystery that only I could decipher.
- Can we talk privately?
- Of course. You can go.
Prepare the guest room.
Dr. Bernstein will stay a few days with us.
And why did he come?
- To ask the hand of Clarissa.
- Oh, no!
My God!
Nothing is impossible.
You see?
I am here with you.
I'm afraid.
- Afraid of what?
- To awaken her.
It's not illusion, Clarissa.
It's reality.
Look at me.
It was exactly what I dreamed.
You came for me.
You was kissing me, but... suddenly, everything becomes confused and... and you're no longer with me... and something falls before my eyes...
There is nothing to fear.
Take me with you.
I am prisoner of my father here.
Locked up in my room every time it's full moon.
I not even dare to complain.
Soon all this will be over.
Stop torturing yourself.
B-O-N-E.
Very good.
You was really good.
I think it's enough for today.
How can I thank you, Miss?
- Do you think it's worth?
- She's a very intelligent girl.
She learned the whole alphabet in a week.
She will be able to hear again?
Or speak at least a little?
She already feels vibrations in her throat.
We must be patient.
She have to lose the stiffness of her vocal cords.
And when it happens, she will speak.
In the end, it's always the same.
To die.
But not even those who died can escape from its destiny.
The life of a mortal one realizes time only in an instant.
Because after death, comes the eternity.
The region without dimensions.
Infinite in time and space.
Reaching it is the most important.
It's there where our love will last forever.
Life will soon pass.
- Good night, Clarissa.
- Good night.
- Who is he?
- It's Dr. Gonzalez.
- A doctor?
- Yes. A friend of my father.
And what he's been doing here at this hour?
Sometimes they work until dawn.
A few hours ago, one of my best friends was killed.
That's why I couldn't come.
Why are you trembling?
The night scares me,
I can't help it.
Take it easy.
We've talked about it.
You don't have to be afraid.
I need to talk to you... where no one can hear us.
Why can't you tell me now?
Tomorrow.
I'll be waiting for you, my love.
Three deaths?
Yes, I have samples of their blood.
I need to check on Herschel scale what zoological species it belongs.
Only one of them managed to save from mutilation.
My God!
- I don't understand.
- What's happening?
I already went over all kinds of blood from Herschel's scale...
And there's nothing equal to the sample have you got?
That's righit.
- Is it human blood?
- Neither.
Do you want to confirm?
Notice how the crystals change their shape.
I need you to understand me clearly.
This marriage will not take place!
Did you hear me?
My decision is definitive.
Listen, Professor. When I give a step, I never turn back.
I will marry Clarissa and it's also definitive.
About this marriage...
What you intend to do?
When Clarissa be my wife,
I will decide our lives.
Your lives?
Today three people has been killed.
Murdered by a lycanthrope.
Go!
I've been attacked... by a lycanthrope...
A lycanthrope...
Everything will depend on his physical resistance.
There's nothing else we can do.
He will die?
Will depend of his organic recovery.
It's something that takes time and... and he just left a few minutes of life.
- I can do it.
- What?
Canceling the cells and vital organs... preventing the tissue's decomposition.
How?
Freezing the body until his recovery.
I've done with diseased plants and
I have relived smaller animals before.
I take the responsibility.
Come on, give me a hand.
Let's get out of here.
It's dangerous.
The temperature can drop quickly.
I have good news, inspector.
In the evening, we capture the killers.
Two?
- Two?
- Yes, a man and a beast.
We found them wandering through the woods.
Come please.
These are the killers.
Beware of the dog, it's a beast.
Jack?
Jack likes to make friends.
Don't trust them, inspector.
Dogs are not hypocrites like men!
If he demonstrate confidence... that's what it is.
Beautiful dog.
Since when you have it?
Since I was a kid, sir.
Where you are from?
From very distant lands.
On the other side of the sea.
I was born in a small village.
It's not even on the map.
And what are you doing here?
It is a crime a man take his dog to take a ride?
What's meaning of this medallion?
It is a distinctive, sir.
It indicates that Jack received a special training.
This dog is a licar.
Licar?
A dog trained to fight against a lycanthrope.
- Lycanthrope?
- Lycanthrope means... werewolf!
- Means what?
- Werewolf.
It's an old superstition.
Come on.
Let me see his belongings.
This man doesn't need to steal.
Money, a map of the region, a dagger and a mute whistle.
Mute for you and me... but not for the dog.
Pay attention.
What is it?
- A knife with an ivory blade.
- An ivory blade?
What's the use for it?
I don't know.
It has something written in Latin.
Could it be translated as:
"Use it only at the time of revenge."
You see, doctor? The cells are working at their minimum function.
However still has life.
It's impressive.
No one would imagine that this frozen body is a living human being.
Something very important, doctor.
No one else should know about it.
It' a professional secret between you and me.
Okay, Professor, but... what about your wife and your daughters?
What will say when they ask about Dr. Bernstein?
- Did you see him leave?
- He is gone.
At where? When?
That's what your father told me.
He will spend a few days off.
Where are you going?
I'm going to talk to my father.
I'll ask him myself.
Wait, let me find out.
Go to your room and when
I discover something, I'll tell you.
Open the door!
Someone, please!
The only thing that calms its horrible greed... it's the heart of his victims.
That's crazy.
If a werewolf bites you and you survive...
That's enough. You're already infected by the curse.
So you too will become forever... a werewolf!
Neither steel or bullets can kill a lycanthrope.
They can only be killed... by the prey of a licar like Jack.
Or a dagger with an ivory blade.
Many people travelled the world keeping track of a human wolf... who had killed a loved one.
Until they face the beast.
And then...
There's no choice but to kill!
Or to die.
No! No, my God!
How is it possible?
You're free.
Last night, while you stay here... an old woman was killed the same manner as the others.
Come on, hurry!
The regeneration of his cells has been completed.
The Dr. Bernstein's life is in my hands more than ever.
And it's more valuable than any other human being.
- Yes, I understand.
- I'm afraid not.
[Missing translation]
When he wakes up, maybe he can tell us who or what was to blame for so many deaths.
I must go to the North.
Tomorrow I will be away, sir.
I must visit some patients.
Good night, professor.
It's me, Crumba.
- Any news, Inspector?
- None.
Could you discovered something analyzing that blood?
Anything.
- The professor is?
- Yes, he's in the laboratory.
- See you later.
- See ya.
I'm sorry to bother you, professor, but...
I feel that my duty is to be with you at least tonight.
Some fear?
I'm not so sure, but... after what happened here last night...
Respect the mourning of this house!
Clarissa...
Let me go!
Make her shut up!
Make her stop!
Come with me!
Come, please!
Why did you do this to me?
Why didn't you make her stop?
Try to understand! Everything what happened has left her disturbed!
Clarissa has no feelings!
And you let her do whatever she wants!
Alicia, you must understand!
Clarissa is sick!
Sick?
I can	't stand it anymore.
What was this?
A shout?
Adelita!
Wait!
You can be wrong!
No! I'm not!
Let him go alone.
Come with me.
Lock yourself in your room.
No, I want to be with you.
What is it?
Ivory.
And what are you going to do?
Something I should have done a long time ago.
Help me!
Clarissa!
Oh, my God!
Why?
After death, comes the region without dimensions...
where time and space are endless.
Reaching it is the most important.
This is where our love will last forever!
THE END
Excuse me, Mr. Filby!
I say...
- I say, it's outright rude of him!
- He's merely been detained.
This is such a waste of time!
If he's not coming, I have more important things to do.
Well, speak up. What is it, woman?
Well, are we or are we not invited for dinner?
Apparently we are.
- How long has he been gone?
- I'm not certain, sir. Several days.
I've hardly seen him for some time.
He never leaves the lab. He only comes in and picks at his food.
But he did tell me about dinner, and left those instructions.
Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.
- What's it say, Filby? What's wrong?
- Nothing, really.
George says that if he's not here by 8, we're to begin without him.
Oh!
Walter, what time is it?
Dinner is served, gentlemen.
Ah, first sensible thing
I've heard all evening.
This is peculiar. He's usually prompt, precise and punctual.
Oh! He's making fools of us by not showing up. It's ungentlemanly.
- To say nothing of a waste of time.
- Huh? Yes. A waste of time.
Ah, one thing I like about
George, best cellar in England.
And Mrs. Watchett is the finest cook in the world.
Yes, I think I'll drink to that.
- Good Lord! What's happened?
- I'm all right.
Some food.
A drink.
- I didn't recognize you.
- Mrs. Watchett.
Can't you speak? What happened to you?
- Leave him alone.
- It's fine.
- I've got to tell it while I remember.
- Relax. Try to relax.
You've all the time in the world.
You're right, David.
That's exactly what I have.
All the time in the world.
Since we were together five days ago... the last day of 1899.
There in that box rests the result of two years' labor.
I wanted to finish the job before the new century began.
I barely made it.
- Cheers, gentlemen.
- Marvelous, old boy.
Mm, yes, but what is it?
Well, it has to do with time.
Oh. I've always maintained that this nation... needs a reliable timepiece.
Mm, the navy needs one. Heh.
The army needs one for the artillery.
You couldn't do better, George.
That's why you've been in hiding?
Very clever of you indeed.
I don't think George is referring to a new timepiece.
No, David.
When I speak of time, I'm referring to the fourth dimension.
Go on, George.
The fourth dimension cannot be seen or felt.
If you don't mind, will you refresh me on the first three dimensions?
Oh, really, Filby. Surely they taught you something in school. Heh-heh.
Suppose you explain it, doctor.
Huh? Oh, certainly.
Heh.
For example, when I move in a line, forward or backward... that's one dimension.
When I move left or right, two dimensions.
When I move up or down... three dimensions.
For instance, that box.
That box has three dimensions: length, breadth and height.
What is the fourth dimension?
Oh, well... That's mere theory.
No one really knows if it exists.
On the contrary.
The fourth dimension is as real and true as the other three.
In fact, they couldn't exist without it.
What do you mean?
Let's take that box.
It has the first three dimensions.
- What's inside?
- I'm coming to that.
Let's consider this first.
Why do we ignore the fourth dimension?
Because we can't move within it.
We can move in the other three. Up, down, forward, sideways, backward.
But when it comes to time, we are prisoners.
Do you follow me, Bridey?
No.
George, you've given a lucid explanation, but I'm afraid I don't understand.
There are many things you don't understand, yes?
Quite a number.
Yet you don't refuse to believe in them?
- Not if I can see the proof myself.
- Good, Walter.
Gentlemen, all I'm asking you... is to witness a demonstration of movement... within the fourth dimension.
- Doctor, can I have your help?
- Certainly. Ahem.
Ah, it's beautiful!
- Remarkable.
- Very nice, George.
Fascinating.
What is it?
This is only an experimental model.
- To carry a man, I need a larger one.
- To carry a man? Where?
Into the past or into the future.
This is a time machine.
Okay, George, you've had your joke.
Tell us what this contraption is for.
I've already told you.
The larger model can carry a passenger through time.
Not through space, but through time.
If you go to the future, won't you mess things up for us?
The future's already there.
It cannot be changed.
I wonder.
That's the most important question I hope to answer.
Can man control his destiny? Can he change the shape of things to come?
If you've gone mad, I forgive you.
- But if you're wasting our time...
- No! You're here as witnesses.
- To see, not to listen.
- To see? What?
The experiment I'm about to perform.
Let me tell you how it works. The time traveler sits in the saddle.
In front are the controls.
Let's do this properly. You can spare a cigar, I trust?
Now, let us imagine that this cigar... is the time traveler.
The lever in front of him controls movement.
Forward pressure sends it into the future... backward pressure, into the past.
The harder the pressure, the faster it travels.
Our little experiment can be performed only once.
If it succeeds, I lose my model.
That's why I need witnesses.
Go ahead, George.
Ready, gentlemen?
Doctor, lend me your hand.
I'll be damned!
It worked.
- Where did it go?
- Go?
Nowhere, in the usual sense. It's still here.
But it's no longer in the present.
It's traveling through time.
To the future, to be exact.
You expect us to believe that?
Well, you just... Certainly.
- You said it hadn't really moved.
- That's correct.
Then why can't we see it?
Because we're in this room on December 31, 1899... but the model is perhaps a hundred years away by now.
This house may not be here in a hundred years.
But the time machine occupies the same space that it did... a moment before its journey.
If it's occupying the same space, why can't I feel it?
The space you're putting your hand through is today's space.
You can't put your hand into tomorrow's space.
Space doesn't change!
The same space that's here now should be here forever.
No, Philip, time changes space!
This flat ground could've been at the bottom of the sea long ago.
A million years from now, it could be the interior of a huge mountain.
If all this is true, what do you expect to do with such a contraption?
Contraption?
I intend taking a journey into the future.
Or perhaps the doctor would volunteer to go?
Mm? Hm.
Look here, George... suppose you do go off and get lost in the 50th century...
- ...how will you get back?
- That's a risk I'm ready to take.
Oh. Now, look here, George.
I don't know what you think, but we're not fools!
We're practical businessmen.
What I want to ask you is this:
Even if you had invented a time machine, what of it?
What's its use? Who'd buy it?
How much would it cost?
Have you thought of the commercial possibilities?
No, I haven't.
George... There's a war on in South Africa.
The Boers are putting up a fight. The country needs inventors like you.
I can put you in touch with the War Office.
What do you think, David?
Oh, I...
Dr. Hillyer has a good point, George.
Ah. That's more sensible. Ha.
I'll see to it right away.
Good Lord! It's time to go.
Yes, I'm sure we all have plans for tonight.
- Are you all right, George?
- Yes, I'm all right.
Coming, Bridewell?
Thanks for coming.
- Good night.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy new century, George.
- Good night.
Happy New Year!
George.
I thought I'd better stay.
You shouldn't trouble yourself. I'm all right.
No, you're not.
You've been behaving oddly for over a month.
I'll leave, once you tell me what's on your mind.
I appreciate the gesture, David.
I just want to be left alone.
You've changed, George. Enormously.
I'm sorry.
Will you answer me one question, honestly?
Yes, I'll try.
Why this preoccupation with time?
Why not?
Don't go simple on me.
The truth is, I don't much care for the time I was born into.
People aren't dying fast enough.
They call upon science to invent... new, more efficient weapons to depopulate the Earth.
And I agree with you.
I agree, but here we are and we have to make the best of it.
You may have to. I don't.
All right. Take your journey on your contraption.
What would you become?
A Greek? A Roman?
- A pharaoh?
- I prefer the future.
You're not seriously saying you can do it?
You saw the experiment, didn't you?
I saw a toy machine vanish.
I'm sure there are any number of ways of doing that trick.
Any magician could probably do it.
It wasn't a trick!
- Would you like to see the full-scale model?
- No, I would not.
I have no desire to tempt the laws of Providence.
And I don't think you should.
- It's not for man to trifle with.
- You carry on like Hillyer and Kemp.
There's something to say about their common-sense attitude.
George, I speak to you as a friend.
More. As a brother.
If that machine can do what you say it can, destroy it.
Destroy it before it destroys you!
You must have plans for New
Year's Eve. Don't let me keep you.
Mary wasn't well. We thought we'd stay home with the baby.
Why not come home with me?
You haven't seen Jamey for a while.
I'm sorry, I can't.
What's stopping you?
Well, I just want to see the old century out by myself, that's all.
Have it your way, George.
George?
Will you promise you'll not go out of the house tonight?
I promise I won't walk out the door.
David?
I'm sorry. Please don't think me unkind or unfriendly.
- Come over to dinner Friday.
- Very well.
- Fine. Bring the others with you.
- As you say, George.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, David.
- Having supper in tonight, sir?
- I don't think so.
Why don't you go and celebrate?
Thanks, but if you don't need me,
I'll turn in earlier, if I can.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
Oh, Mrs. Watchett, I invited Mr. Filby and the others to dinner Friday.
- Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.
- Happy New Year, sir.
Happy New Year!
At first, I pushed the lever forward very slightly...
and the laboratory grew faint around me.
I stopped.
No change.
Everything exactly as before.
No! The clock said 6:31 when I started, and now it was...8:09?
And the candle, shorter by inches.
Yet by my watch, which was with me, only a few seconds had passed.
It was disconcerting to see the sun arc in less than a minute.
To see a snail race by.
Flowers flinging wide their petals to embrace the day.
The hours speeding across my sundial.
Flowers closing their eyes for the night.
It was wonderful!
Changes that normally took hours took seconds.
Dear Mrs. Watchett...
always able to suggest a tie...
but never wearing anything more stylish...
than what she's worn for years.
Yet I was traveling very slowly.
What if I went faster?
It became intoxicating.
I pushed the lever on toward even greater speed.
I gained experience in handling the machine.
I could stop for a day, an hour, or even a second to observe.
Then go ahead a year or two.
I was able to see the changing world in a series of glimpses.
Good heavens. That's a dress?
This was intriguing.
I wondered just how far women would permit this to go.
I began to grow very fond of that mannequin.
Maybe because, like me, she didn't age.
Thirteen years passed.
Fourteen, 15, 16...
Suddenly the light was gone.
What had happened?
In the year 1917, I stopped.
Filby!
Are you going to a masquerade party?
You look rather silly without your mustache.
- Were you addressing me, sir?
- It's George!
I expected a more enthusiastic greeting...
You're confusing me with my father.
Yes. There was quite a resemblance. I'm James Filby.
"Was"?
- Were you a friend of Father's?
- Yes.
Yes, I've been away.
He was killed in the war.
A year ago.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
- And the gentleman across the street?
- Oh, the inventor chap?
He disappeared around the turn of the century.
If you're interested in that house, you can't buy it.
- You can't even get inside.
- Why?
My father was executor of the estate and refused to liquidate it.
I often chided him on that... but he believed the owner would return some day.
People hereabouts think it's haunted, but, heh-heh...
Who are you, sir?
Just a stranger who once knew your father.
Have you been at the front?
Front? What front?
Why, the war, of course.
What war?
Good heavens!
You don't know we've been at war with Germany since 1914?
I thought you'd just returned from France.
Or perhaps...
Perhaps some tea might make you feel better.
Won't you come in?
No, thank you.
Are you sure you're all right?
Yes, I'm quite all right.
Then goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, Jamey.
In 1940, I began to be buffeted from side to side.
I first thought the machine had a mechanical defect.
The last time I had stopped was in 1917, 23 years ago.
The war was still waging, now in the air with flying machines.
Then I realized the truth.
This was a new war.
Uh, I decided to push on into time and see the outcome of this.
My house was hit!
The flames shot up.
Instantly, my home was gone.
I was in the open air.
The years rolled by, everything unfamiliar.
Except the, uh, heh, smile of my never-aging friend.
What was this? Weird sounds all around. What could it be?
My curiosity compelled me to stop.
At first I wondered if I was the cause of the panic.
I was soon to find out I wasn't.
Keep it moving! Shove it on!
Come on, into the shelter.
Come on, young man! Come on!
- Filby?
- The name is Mr. Filby.
- Didn't you hear the siren?
- The horrible screeching?
It wasn't constructed for its aesthetic value... but to warn young fools to get into the shelter.
- Now, come along.
- I'm perfectly comfortable here.
I've got to talk to somebody.
This is fantastic!
Your store is magnificent!
The achievements!
- The gigantic strides man has taken!
- Come along, young man!
The mushrooms will be sprouting!
Mushrooms?
You look familiar. Haven't we met somewhere before?
Indeed we have, Mr. Filby.
Right there. Many years ago.
I was sure of that... but the exact time escapes me.
It was two wars ago, 1917.
Now I recall. The chap who inquired about my father... and the house that used to stand across the way.
Oh, but no...
No, that's impossible!
You haven't changed.
You're not a day older.
And your clothes!
Don't worry, Filby. It'll take time to explain, but...
That's the last alert!
Hurry! Hurry!
- Listen, this is important.
- Look!
An atomic satellite, zeroing in.
That's important.
Come on! Come on!
- But I've got to talk to you!
- Come on!
Filby?
Filby!
Hurry! Hide till the all-clear!
But, Filby, I've got to talk to you!
The labor of centuries, gone in an instant.
Mother Earth, aroused by man's violence...
responded with volcanic violence of her own.
Only my speed through time saved me from being encased in stone.
The molten rock cooled.
I prayed...
wondering how many eons must pass...
before the wind and rain could wear away the mountain.
Darkness.
Darkness for centuries.
I wondered if there was still a war being waged above me...
if man would still exist when I saw the sun again.
The centuries rolled by.
I put my trust in time...
and waited for the rock to wear down.
I was free again!
Thousands of centuries had passed, but the Earth stayed green.
There was no winter, no wars.
Had man learned to control both the elements and himself?
I had to stop and find out.
But I'd stopped too fast.
Magnificent!
Beautiful flowers everywhere!
Natural splendor beyond compare.
The whole landscape a garden without any weeds or briars.
Trees and vines laden with fruit of strange shapes and colors.
Nature tamed completely...
and more bountiful than ever!
At last I'd found a paradise.
But it would be no paradise if it was mine alone.
Unrepaired for centuries.
Maybe unlived-in for as long.
Anybody here?
So this is man's future: to bask in the sun, bathe in the streams...
and eat the fruits of the Earth, work and hardship forgotten.
Well, and why not?
Don't just sit there! Help her!
Are you all right?
Thank you.
- Why did you?
- Why did I what?
Come after me.
Sit down.
I did it to save your life.
That doesn't seem to mean much to you, or anybody else.
It doesn't.
Twenty of your friends were watching you drown.
Not one lifted a finger to save you.
That's a very curious attitude.
A very curious world.
Uh, aren't you interested in who
I am? Where I come from?
Should I be?
Take me to somebody a little older. Somebody I can talk to.
There is no one older.
Do you mean nobody ages in this land of yours?
- Well, what's your name?
- Weena.
Weena.
How do you spell it?
- Spell?
- Spell, write. Can't you write?
Look.
Weena.
- What are your people called?
- Eloi.
Aha.
Eloi.
Come. We must go now.
- What's wrong?
- It's getting dark.
Hello.
I don't mind telling you, I'm quite hungry.
I've come a long, long way.
In my time, a berry that size... would've been big news all over the world.
Excuse me, sir.
Uh, sir?
Perhaps curiosity has died.
Perhaps courtesy too... but I've come far and I'd like to know things.
Why?
Because I shall return to my time, and my people will ask questions.
Such as:
What kind of government rules your world?
We have no government.
Well, you must have a body of men who pass and enforce laws.
Laws? There are no laws.
Where do you get food and clothing?
Doesn't anybody work?
No.
Well, where does that come from?
- It grows. It always grows.
- I know, but it must be... cultivated and planted and nurtured, um...
Well, unless you...
You have an economy so well-developed that you can spend all your time... studying and experimenting?
Is that right?
You ask many questions.
Well, that is the only way man has learned and developed.
I wish to learn.
I want to learn about your civilization.
Perhaps, you...
Do you have books?
Books?
- Yes, we have books.
- Wonderful!
I can learn about you from books.
They'll tell me what I want to know.
Could I see the books?
Yes, they do tell me all about you.
What have you done?
Thousands of years of building, rebuilding, creating and re-creating... so you can let it crumble to dust!
A million years of sensitive men dying for their dreams.
For what?
So you can swim and dance... and play!
You! All of you!
I'm going back! I won't bother to tell of the useless struggle... the hopeless future. But at least I'll die among men!
You're... Aah!
- Weena, what are you doing?
- I came to warn you.
- How do you open that panel?
- No one can. Only the Morlocks.
Who are the Morlocks?
They give us our food and clothes. We must obey.
Why'd they take my machine?
You've got to tell me!
We mustn't be out in the dark.
Only children are frightened by the dark.
You are a child, aren't you?
- I'll light a fire.
- Please, let us go.
My machine is inside. I must find a way to get it out.
- No, you mustn't.
- Help me gather some wood.
Come on.
That's a girl.
Where are you from?
As a matter of fact,
I'm from right here.
That's where my house used to be... many thousands of years ago.
You see there?
Up to those panels was my laboratory.
Beyond them was where my garden used to be.
And right there... that was my library.
Where I once sat talking with friends about... the time machine.
Mm.
You know, Weena...
I'd hoped to learn such a great deal.
I hoped to take back the knowledge and advancement man had made.
Instead, I find vegetables.
The human race reduced to living vegetables.
They're gone. Are you all right?
- Was that a Morlock?
- Yes.
Don't you worry. The fire seems to keep them away.
What are you doing? Why did you put your hand there?
- I never saw it before.
- You...?
No knowledge of fire.
No books.
I'm terribly sorry.
I had no right to be angry with your people.
No more than if I'd visited the island of Bali in my own time.
But, you know, Weena... you were safe inside your house, yet came out to warn me.
The characteristic which distinguished man from animals... was the spirit of self-sacrifice.
And you have that quality.
So do all your people. It just needs someone to reawaken it.
I'd like to try, if you'll let me.
Will you?
I do not understand...
- ...but I believe you.
- Heh.
That's as good a start as any.
Try to tell me. The Morlocks...
Who or what are they?
Are they animals or people?
Well, what about yourself?
Don't your people ever speak of the past?
There is no past.
Well, do they ever wonder about the future?
There is no future.
The past... man's past... is mainly a grim struggle for survival.
But there have been moments when a few voices have spoken up... and these rare moments have made man's past... a glorious thing.
I refuse to believe it's dead and gone.
We've had dark ages before.
This is just another one.
All it needs is someone to show you the way out.
I'm only a mechanic... but I'm sure there must be that spark in one of you.
If only I can kindle that spark... my coming here will have meaning.
My efforts to open the panel were fruitless.
I had to find another way to retrieve my machine.
Listen.
Do you hear that?
Yes.
Machines?
- No, Morlocks.
- Wait.
Those animals run machines?
They are Morlocks.
- Have you ever seen the machines?
- No, only heard of them.
- Who told you?
- The rings.
- What sort of rings?
- Rings that talk.
Could you show me these rings?
Come, this way.
- These are the talking rings?
- Yes.
They speak?
Of what?
Things no one here understands.
Make it talk.
Now in its 326th year, the war between the East and West...
has at last come to an end.
There's nothing to fight with and few left to fight.
The atmosphere has become so polluted with germs...
that it can no longer be breathed.
There is no place left that is immune.
The last factory for the manufacture of oxygen has been destroyed.
Stockpiles are rapidly diminishing...
and when they are gone, we must die.
My name is of no consequence.
You should know that I am the last who remembers how each of us...
man and woman, made his own decision.
Some chose to take refuge in the great caverns...
and find a new way of life below the Earth's surface.
The rest of us decided to take our chances in the sunlight...
small as those chances might be.
From the rings I learned how the human race divided...
and how the world of the
Eloi and the Morlocks began.
By some awful quirk of fate...
the Morlocks became the masters and the Eloi their servants.
The Morlocks maintained them and bred them like...
Like cattle...
only to take them below when they reached maturity.
Which explained why there were no older people.
I knew I must go below. It was the only way to reach my machine...
and discover what happened to the little people.
Don't go!
- You won't come back!
- I'll be back.
Weena?
Weena!
Weena?
Weena?
Weena?
Answer me!
Where are you?
What's happening?
What's happening?
What's the matter with you all?
Weena!
Weena?
Weena?
Weena, stop!
Weena?
Stop!
What happens to them?
Don't stand there like fatted cattle!
Will you answer me?
- What is wrong?
- Nothing is wrong. It is all clear.
- What do you mean, all clear?
- All clear.
In the mid-1900s, the bombs, the people calling out, "All clear!"
No!
That's gone! That's passed!
There are no more flying machines!
No bombs! No more wars!
The rings have told us that story.
But you didn't listen!
You didn't learn!
It was ages ago that men were taught to hide when the sirens blew... to run from death, but it's over!
Those men and those who slaughtered them are dead!
But there is nothing to fear. It is all clear.
What about the ones who went below?
How will they come back?
They never come back.
- Nobody can bring them back.
- You can try. You can try!
Won't even one of you try?
Well, I'll try!
So this was the destiny of the Eloi.
They were being bred by the Morlocks...
who had degenerated into the lowest form of human life:
Cannibalism!
Wake up! Come to your senses! All of you!
Burn.
Give me something to burn.
It's my last match.
Good, good.
Get up the stairs!
That's the way out!
The torch!
Get the torch!
Get up the steps! Hurry up!
Come on, hurry!
Go on, Weena.
Gather all the deadwood!
All the wood!
That's fine. Come on, throw it down!
All the deadwood!
Throw it down! Do the same to the other wells!
All the wood down the wells!
All right, to the river!
Back to the river!
All right, let's go!
Another night was coming, but this night no Eloi needed to fear.
The underworld of the
Morlocks was gone...
and so was the life of leisure for the Eloi.
But then what of me?
I was imprisoned in a world...
in which I just did not belong.
Are you sorry?
- Hm? Sorry? Sorry for what?
- That you have to stay?
Yes.
I could tell so much to the people of my time.
I'd let them know... about the sorrow and happiness that the future holds.
Maybe they could learn from it.
Or could they?
- You don't want to stay, do you?
- It isn't that.
It's just that I don't fit here, any more than you would in my time.
I would love to see your time.
Mm-mm. You wouldn't be very happy there.
Do you have someone there?
Someone like me?
No one like you.
I have friends who will miss me, of course.
I'm probably late already.
Women?
No.
There is one woman.
She looks after my house for me.
She's 62 years old and all wrinkled.
How do they wear their hair?
- Who?
- The women of your time.
- Up.
- Up?
Up how?
I don't know. Kind of... up, like that.
Show me!
Would I be pretty?
Yes, you would. Very pretty.
Oh, Weena.
I wish we could go back to my time.
Or even before that, when the world was young.
- We could be so very happy.
- Look!
Look!
Look!
My machine!
Come on, Weena!
Weena!
I was going the wrong way!
Back! I had to go back!
It's the most ridiculous story
I've ever heard. Preposterous!
George, you always could tell a good yarn.
You're a truly great inventor, George.
I think you ought to retire, sir.
Truthfully, George, where have you been the past week?
Don't ask such questions.
It is not hard for a man to lose a week now and again.
I can understand your doubt.
Take it as a lie if you wish.
I scarcely believe it myself, now that I'm back...
David, there's the flower Weena gave me.
A present for you. You're interested in botany.
Try to match that with any known species!
I don't think I can.
- Well, time to go, Bridewell.
- Mm? Oh.
- Yes, it is getting late.
- Good night, George.
Good night, George.
Good night.
You look exhausted, George. You really should get some rest.
Good night. It's grand having you back.
Goodbye, David.
Thanks for being such a good friend. Always.
What do you think, Filby?
One thing is certain.
That flower couldn't bloom in the wintertime.
You don't really believe that story?
Good night.
Go on, driver.
George?
- Mr. Filby, what...?
- He's gone!
Why, look!
I think I understand.
You see the imprint?
This is where it originally stood.
The Morlocks moved it.
They dragged it across the lawn... right into the sphinx. Right there.
Weena was standing here when he last saw her.
Right here! The same space in a different time.
So he dragged his heavy machine back in here... scratching the floor... so he could appear outside the sphinx again... and help the Eloi build a new world.
Build a new world for himself.
- Right where he left her.
- Yes.
It's not like George to return empty-handed.
To try to rebuild a civilization without a plan.
He must have taken something with him.
Nothing.
- Except three books.
- Which three books?
I don't know. Is it important?
Oh, I suppose not.
Only... which three would you have taken?
Do you think he'll ever return?
One cannot choose but wonder.
You see, he has all the time in the world.

Read, Rector!
Rector!
Now that you're going home, just try to stay out of mischief!
On last vacation, two seminarians, disguised as devils, were caught stealing chickens.
Zozulia and Lemesh, I mean you!
The other three had gotten a deacon drunk, and then goaded him into singing bawdy, indecent songs!
For shame!
And now, let us pray together.
Lord, let the Light of Thy wisdom shine down upon us.
And bestow on our hearts
Thy tender mercy.
Preserve us from all evil.
And Heaven and Earth will resound with glorious songs of praise.
Amen.
Be sure you return in time for the
Feast of the Immaculate Conception!
We should've spotted a farm long ago.
The devil would lose his way too, in this darkness.
- Where did the road go?
- There is no road.
Look, Khaliava, you go that way.
And I'm going over this way.
And Gorobetz...
Hey, Gorobetz!
Damn it, I took a rotten stump for your head.
- What did you find?
- Just fox-holes.
- Well, what do we do?
- Let's sing at the top of our lungs.
Quiet! I know...
Let's sleep under the stars.
No, Khaliava, that won't do.
We have to keep looking. Someone might give us a glass of vodka.
Sure, it's better than sleeping under the stars.
There's a farmhouse ahead!
Come on!
It's our last chance, brothers, to find a place to stay.
- Open up!
- Hello?
- Who is it?
- Khaliava, the theologian.
- Brutus, the philosopher.
- Gorobetz, the orator.
No, the house is full of people.
Where would I put you?
Have mercy on us, my good woman!
It's unforgivable to let Christian souls perish in the night.
- Just somewhere to sleep...
- And if we do something wrong...
All right, but each of you must sleep in a separate place.
Whatever you wish.
- Listen, good woman...
- We're ready to drop with hunger...
It's been so long since we've eaten.
There's nothing in the house to eat.
I haven't lit the stove all day.
Tomorrow we'll see that you're rewarded handsomely.
You couldn't get a crumb out of the old skinflint. The hell with her!
- Boy, I want you to come here.
- Who? Me?
You can sleep in the house.
And you, the tall one, up in the loft.
- Well, where do I stay?
- Come with me.
What do you want, granny?
No, it's the time of lent.
And not for all the gold in the world would I let you tempt me.
You're not in the flower of youth, you know.
What's wrong with you, granny?
For the love of God!
Good Lord, she's a witch!
Shameless witch!
Put me down! Let me be!
In the name of God Jesus Christ, put me down! Let me be!
If I'm not making you fly, it must be Christ, and his apostle, Thomas!
Oh, you're killing me!
Khoma!
Scat!
- What we need is tar.
- I know that.
Hey, Khoma, the Rector sent me to get you. Someone came for you.
Ah, it's you, brother Khoma.
The daughter of one of our richest Sotniks is dying.
The one who owns the estate just twenty miles outside Kiev.
Yesterday, the girl returned home, beaten almost to death.
She expressed a wish that in her final agony, the last prayers for her salvation be said by you, Khoma Brutus.
Why me? I don't even know how to do that!
Don't argue with me.
You will leave immediately.
The famous Sotnik was good enough to send his men and a wagon.
You'll have to get somebody else to go, 'cause I'm not leaving!
No one asked you if you wanted to go or not.
Thank your good master for his gift of the honey and the eggs.
And tell him I shall send the books as soon as they're ready.
And as for you, I suggest you learn to control that tongue of yours.
Otherwise, I shall have you lashed before the whole school, so you won't be able to sit down for a week.
The Lord be with you.
And with your good master.
Yavtukh, see that our friends have some vodka before they leave.
Well, don'tjust stand there.
Be off with you!
And if you know what's good for you, you'll mend your ways!
You'd better tie up the philosopher, so he won't be tempted to run off.
- Good day, my brothers.
- Good day, brother philosopher.
I've been ordered to travel in your company.
- A splendid carriage!
- Yes, a spacious one!
We could hire some musicians and dance with all the room there is.
I wonder, if it were filled with a heavy load, say you loaded up the wagon with salt or metal poles, can you tell me how many horses it would take?
It would take a lot of horses, if you have a lot of salt.
Can you tell me what sort of illness the girl is cursed with, that requires such solemn prayers to deliver her soul?
Sit down, brother philosopher.
We're not there, yet.
- Stop!
- An inn! Stop!
Whoa, girl, whoa! We're there.
Let's go in, brother philosopher.
Spirid, don't forget to water the horses.
Welcome, my friends. Please go inside.
- Do you have vodka?
- Yes, step inside.
My friends, I propose a toast to the health of the Rector.
Here's to the health of the Rector.
Drink, my good friends.
Oh, the Cossack drinks on someone else's money...
Another round!
Another round!
Serve another round!
I'd like to know one thing. Just what are you seminarians taught?
What the deacon says when he's in church, or other things?
- What a great scholar.
- I want to be a seminarian too.
Do you think I'm not clever enough?
I can learn anything!
Oh good Lord! Lord have mercy on us!
The Cossack drinks on someone else's...
- I just want to know one thing...
- Will you leave me alone, you pest?
Don't ask him.
Only God knows everything.
I just want to know what's written in those books.
- There could be other things in them.
- How can you talk that way?
- Let me go.
- Why not let him go?
Philosopher.
Don't be afraid, come here.
The master will never know.
- Don'tjust stand there. Come on.
- Let me go home, my good brothers.
Let me go home!
The young woman is dead.
The girl is dead.
Be quiet! The young woman is dead.
- The girl is dead?
- Dead? Already?
Quiet, Serko! The young woman is dead!
Why don't we let Khoma go now?
- Of course we'll let him go.
- He can do as he wants.
Leave him alone...
The young woman is dead.
Come on, you silly pig!
Brother philosopher, you're wrong to try to get out of here.
It's not the sort of place you can escape from.
You'd better go to the master.
He is waiting for you.
Why not? I would love to meet him.
It is not so much the pain of losing you, my dearest daughter, in the flower of your youth, that makes your loss more than a father can bear, as the torment I suffer at not knowing what monster was the cause of your death.
Who are you? What is your quality, and where do you come from?
From seminary. My name is
Khoma Brutus.
- And who was your father?
- I don't know.
- Your mother, then?
- I never knew her, either.
Of course, I must have had one like anyone else, but who she was, or what she was like, I never knew.
How did you make the acquaintance of my daughter?
I never met your daughter, sir.
I know nothing of girls.
I swear I've never known one.
Why did she name you, then?
Only God knows why.
The rich people fancy things that don't make sense even to a scholar.
As the saying goes: When masters fall out, their men get the clout.
You're not lying, are you, philosopher?
God strike me dead if I'm lying.
If she had lived a minute longer,
I would have known everything.
"Let no one say prayers for me, father, but send men at once to Kiev Seminary and tell them to bring here seminarian Khoma Brutus.
And let him pray for three nights for the salvation of my soul.
He knows."
And what he knows, that I hadn't time to hear.
Have you been known for your chaste life?
Could she hear about you from someone?
Me? Chaste life?
For heaven's sake, sir!
I visited a baker's wife on Maundy Thursday.
Nonetheless, she named you, that's all that counts.
As of tonight, you will start reciting the prayers for her soul.
Yes, but certainly you want to do the best thing...
Of course, anyone versed in the Scriptures could do it...
But the best thing would be to have a deacon, or even a sub-deacon.
They are well-trained and will do what's necessary.
I haven't got a suitable voice. Also,
I don't have a good appearance.
I'll do as my dear child had wanted it.
I don't care what it may cost.
You will start your vigil tonight, and recite the prayers for three nights, and I shall reward you handsomely for it. Otherwise...
How could our dear mistress abandon us?
Oh, dear child, tell us what made you leave us?
Come back! Come back, beloved!
May God the Father have mercy on her soul
May God the Son have mercy on her soul.
May God the Holy Ghost have mercy on her soul.
Give the philosopher his dinner.
Then bring him back to the church.
Tell them how the witch cast a spell on the huntsman.
It's a shame, brother philosopher, that you didn't know Mikitka.
Even his dogs adored him.
He was a fine huntsman.
Only recently he had the misfortune to fall for the young mistress.
- Either he fell in love with her...
- Or she bewitched him...
No one knows for sure.
But the man was lost.
One day the girl appeared in the stable and said:
"Mikitka, let me put my foot on you to help me onto the horse."
The poor man was so overjoyed, he said:
"I'd rather you yourself climbed onto my back."
And the fool took her onto his back, and went galloping away!
It's time we take the philosopher to where the corpse is lying.
We'll leave you now.
- Just pray in earnest.
- The best of luck to you.
Forgive us, but we must lock you up in. By order of the master.
That's all right. It's no more than three nights of work.
And then the master will fill both of my pockets with gold.
There's nothing to fear.
She won't rise up out of her coffin.
Even corpses fear the word of God.
Am I right? Absolutely.
You better stay there.
Don't you know that a Cossack doesn't fear anything?
There's no way for anyone to come in.
And from corpses,
I have prayers to protect me.
As soon as I speak the holy words, no demon can possibly harm me.
They'll never touch me!
What am I scared of?
I just had too much to drink.
Ah, candles... That's good.
Lots of candles... to chase away... the gloom from the church... and light it up.
It's nothing, only three nights.
The church should be full of light.
Cheerful and bright.
There's nothing to fear.
She won't touch me now, will she!
Ow! Oh, Satan!
May God forgive me, poor sinner.
Lots of light, now.
Well, let's begin.
Blessed are... O Lord...
Blessed are they that fear the Almighty.
And they that live according to Thy Word.
I wish it were not prohibited to smoke in the House of God.
They that honor Thy commandments, walk in the path of righteousness.
They that praise Thee in the hope of eternal...
What's wrong with some snuff?
A good sniff, to clear the brain.
Merciful Father! Thou art my strength...
She's a witch! A witch come to haunt me!
Sacred circle, save me!
Sacred circle, protect me!
Oh, my God.
Sacred circle, save me!
Sacred circle, protect me!
Away, Satan! Away!
Blessed are they that fear the Almighty...
Away! Away with you!
God in Heaven, I call on Thee for help...
Stay away!
- There's the philosopher!
- He's finished.
It's a lovely place to live!
You could fish all day in that river.
Old man!
I'm not going inside.
I'll sleep right here.
It's not allowed, philosopher.
I have my orders.
- Have you got some borsch for us?
- We have, you old devil.
- How does it taste?
- Ask the philosopher.
- Well?
- What did go on?
Nothing much. Just some noises.
A Cossack doesn't fear anything in this world.
Let's go, Yavtukh.
A Cossack is never afraid of anything.
It's true, the first time, you really are afraid.
But after a while, you're not so afraid.
And after that, you're not afraid at all!
Because there's nothing that can do me any harm.
Lord God! Let not Thy divine Angel be turned against me.
I ask Thee to spare me
Thy terrible wrath.
Have mercy upon Thy servant.
I know my spirit's weak.
God, save me from my weaknesses, preserve my heart from sin, my soul from evil...
Strengthen my spirit and protect me from the temptations of evil.
Have mercy on...
God Almighty, save me!
Heavenly Father, save me!
O Lord!
Save me from the demon!
O Lord!
Save me from the demon!
God, give me strength!
Holy Father in Heaven!
Save me from the evil one!
Khoma!
Khoma!
By the shades of night, may he go blind, turn his hair white.
Bewitch him.
Cover him with snow.
Hey, philosopher! On your feet!
I want music!
I want to have music right now!
From the looks of it, he'll dance all day, that fellow.
Yes, he can dance for a long time.
- Hey, philosopher, what's wrong?
- Don't you see? I'm dancing.
Oh, your hair has turned white!
As white as milk.
Just like good old Yavtukh.
I must talk to your master.
I'll explain everything.
I don't want to pray there again!
What? It's all going well?
Were you able to stay awake?
Yes, I was able to stay awake.
The devil lives in this house. I want to skip out while I'm in one piece.
- What do you mean?
- It's your daughter, sir...
She may have noble blood in her veins, no doubt about that, however, may God have mercy on her soul...
- What about my daughter?
- She's in league with the devil.
She won't let me read the Scriptures in front of her.
You will read, since she summoned you.
She did not wish to bear a spiritual burden to the grave.
The only way to assure her salvation was to have the prayers said.
Release me, I beg you!
Don't make me go through with it.
You will read!
There's just one more night.
You'll do godly work, and I will reward you.
For all the gold in the world...
I wouldn't read another prayer.
That's enough!
Philosopher...
You're wrong if you think you can trifle with me.
That sort of thing is fit for the seminary, but I'll not tolerate it.
I'll order the guards to lash you.
There's nothing so excruciating as as the leather lash on raw flesh.
I know that.
More than half a dozen are unbearable.
However, what you don't know is how expert my men are at it.
They lash you, then we give them some vodka and they begin again.
You may go.
Go back to your duties.
If you fail to do them, you'll have a thousand lashes.
And if you do them, one thousand gold pieces.
A thousand gold pieces!
The old miser was surely lying.
Never mind, good master,
I'll run away from here so fast that even your dogs will never catch up with me.
You should know better than make such a detour.
You nearly ruined your fine robe.
That would've been a shame.
How much did you pay for one yard?
Why don't you keep your mouth shut, dear old Yavtukh?
Foolish dog.
Not hungry? Then let's go to the church.
Are you scared? That witch will give you the time of your life.
Scared of a witch?
Nothing scares a Cossack!
I stood it for two nights.
With God's help, I'll make it three.
She's haunting me because she's got the Devil inside her.
I'd hate to think what sin she's guilty of.
Brother philosopher, it's time to go.
Let's go to the church, dear.
- Think of the torment she's in.
- He was fated to go through it.
I'll read for the third night, and I'll get a thousand gold pieces.
I'll have a ball then, won't I,
Yavtukh?
Go say your prayers, philosopher.
I won't be afraid. I swear,
I won't be afraid.
Lord God! From the depths of hell,
I cry out to Thee.
I pray Thee, have pity on me.
Take heed of my cries.
Drive out the terror that dwells in my heart.
Let me not yield to the temptations of the evil one.
Lord God, help me...
Thou art my Fortress...
My Redeemer, and my Savior...
God Almighty!
Smite her with lightning!
Send down Thy wrath!
Strike her down with Thy fury!
A curse upon you!
With the wings of a bat!
With the blood of a serpent!
I shall curse you!
Curse you!
I summon the vampires!
I summon the werewolves!
I summon the vampires!
I summon the werewolves!
I summon Viy!
Bring Viy here!
Get him! Get him!
Raise my eyelids.
I cannot see!
Don't look him in the eye, or you're lost.
A cock.
I see him!
Get away from me, you fiends!
Help!
- The Fates were unkind to Khoma.
- It was the will of God.
Let's drink to him, may his soul rest in peace.
Khoma was a fine young man.
The kind of man I admire.
- But his life was wasted for nothing.
- I know where he went wrong.
If he hadn't been afraid, the witch couldn't have harmed him.
He should've spit on her tail, and make the sign of the cross.
If anyone should know, I do.
In Kiev, the women who run stalls in the market are all witches.
He wouldn't be dead if he hadn't been afraid.
- No one can prove he's dead.
- That's what everyone says.
Maybe they imagined it.
That stuff about how he died, because of the witch.
After I've had a flask of vodka, even I begin to see witches.
Suppose he wasn't dead?
Suppose that the one walking this way now... was him!
Now that's a good one!
- Are you working?
- We're working.
Keep on working then.
The End
Listen, the earth could not bury me.
The sea could not smother me, rage and storm though she might, the whore.
I am Encolpio. I am penniless.
I am banished my home.
I am fugitive from justice, my hands stained with blood.
I am alone, abandoned, utterly wretched.
And who is it condemned me to this solitude?
A shit of a man, marked by every vice.
A turd of a person, should be banished by his own admission - Ascilto!
He seeks to liberate himself through his wantonness - you may use him any way you like.
He hires himself out as a woman does, that bastard!
And as for that tart Gitone!
That one. He sits down to piss like a woman does, him!
That one wears a skirt, like he was not born a man.
A boy who played the whore in prison.
Down with his coat and face to the wall for every bull.
What shame. What shame!
But worse still, he is a faithless wretch after all I've done for him.
He's capable of such infamy.
The pair of them laugh at me.
I'm not at all well in my soul.
I loved you, Gitone. I love you still and will not share you with Ascilto.
You are my self, my soul.
Listen, you are the sun. Listen, you are the sea sweeps drunken over me.
You are divinest of divine and wrenched from me cruel by Ascilto, who is a shit.
I must find you, no matter what, or I'm not a man.
I shall find you! I shall!
Ascilto!
Ascilto!
Ascilto!
Encolpio is after my hide.
Oh, he is vindictive.
I made away with his little friend and he doesn't like it, though he deserves all he gets - the assassin, the night prowler!
Like a bird of prey, he strikes.
Encolpio, the thief, grabbing at all that glitters.
While he slept, I dragged Gitone from under him and slid into him myself.
Such is friendship - very accommodating.
Sweet and sullen.
At first, the boy would not have me pick his flower.
Maybe he was sleepy.
But I drew my other sword and showed it, saying:
"See, Lucrezia, here comes your trusted Tarquin!"
A famous actor has him now, offered and sold to him.
I sold all for a handful of coin, which is why I shall never be loved.
Wandering later in the city, a good family man found me.
Brought me to the baths, shyly held me by the hand - there in that niche - and "Come" insisted. So I came!
And here comes Encolpio, livid, come to search me out and put his case.
I shall have to fight, or run.
Me? Is it me you look for, Encolpio?
Come here!
- (laughs)
- Where is Gitone?
(laughter)
Where's Gitone?
You're a perfect asshole.
Sold, love, sold.
I sold him to Vernacchio, the actor.
I'm sorry, love.
(screams)
(laughter)
Ah!
Ah... (laughs)
(farts rhythmically)
(farts)
Plaudite, plaudite, plaudite.
(woman chuckles)
(dog barking)
(actors speak Vulgar Latin)
(man sobs)
(cries out)
And thus is punished my right arm which has failed me.
(cackles)
(crows like a cockerel)
- (thud)
- Aaagh!
(applause)
(Vulgar Latin)
(man) Bene actum.
(speaks Vulgar Latin)
- Hail the Caesar!
- Hail the Caesar!
Hail the Caesar! Hail the Caesar!
(speaks Vulgar Latin)
How fortunate are we, each day to see new miracles from our divine Caesar.
Demonstration!
Caesar, the master of all!
Eros, with his quiver of lust, descend to earth!
Vernacchio, you will hold your peace.
That boy belongs to me.
Here is a patron, an important personage!
That young man is mine.
You do well to give him back at once.
So, a senator. So, a nobleman.
Step up, Your Grace.
Vernacchio's house is at your command.
Coraggio!
Right! First, I want to present my family.
And my slaves.
- And the dog! (laughs)
- (barks)
Gitone, get down at once!
Oh, my Lord. He's slender, plump, and he only cost me 30 denarii!
A suckling pig so plump would cost more today.
See here, Vernacchio.
Such a fine actor, famous.
Having seen you perform,
I know how famous you are.
But I repeat, the pretty rascal's mine.
That crazy bastard cheated you. He had no authority in selling what is mine.
The law will not uphold it.
Ascilto cheated you and me.
Gitone will come with me!
- You...
- I will have the rascal... for 40 sesterces.
He's so pretty... 45.
Perhaps 60 will be enough for him, eh?
No.
Signori, a grave question I pose.
I ask you, citizens, who will sell his wife?
He is my wife.
He keeps my bedclothes warm.
He is adept in the great art of theatrics.
He will make you a perfect woman.
Helen with Menelaus, lovely Penelope and Cornelia.
- Such treasure is priceless.
- Vernacchio...
(jabbers)
I'll return the sum you paid.
That's perfectly fair.
Gitone then comes with me.
No. Never!
Vernacchio! You go too far.
You are become intolerable.
You have been punished once for joking about Caesar. Perhaps you want more.
Shall I take away your theatre?
The young man is to have his little slave or you shall have your theatre burned about your ears.
- No, may I say that Vernacchio...
- Too far, Vernacchio.
You trespass upon our patience.
Please! For pity, do not destroy my theatre, I beg you.
Vernacchio submits. Vernacchio's obedient. Caesar knows that.
(chanting)
Look who's there.
Calpurnia! Do you know where we live?
You live here.
You know you live here, sweetheart.
There. That's him.
Come on. Very lovely little girlies.
Very, very, very, very...
Come closer. Come here.
Your choice of day is propitious.
You want to know if your wife is fertile?
This colour is brown-red, thus showing that children will flow from her.
(speaks Vulgar Latin)
Vene. Vene!
Stop. You with the blue eyes, haven't you heard of me?
You're well known to be famous!
Gitone!
(speaks Vulgar Latin)
(man laughs)
(muttering)
(speaks Vulgar Latin)
(woman speaks Vulgar Latin)
(speaks Vulgar Latin)
(woman coughs)
(shouting)
(panting)
(voices echoing)
(screams)
(grunt in unison)
(voices crescendo)
- (whiplash)
- Ohhhh!
Oh, my dear friend and brother.
What do you do?
Why, share a single tent for two, hm?
Seriously, Ascilto.
Our friendship can no longer be the same.
So let's divide what little we have in common. It's not absolute poverty.
You have ways of earning money.
You're still studying. So am I. But we've become known here for our scandal...
Why do you behave so scandalously?
Me, because I'm starving I work.
Nobody's trying to stop you from working.
Certainly not me, anyway.
Come on, then. All right, divide it up.
Question: which is mine?
The mirror. That's mine.
That's mine!
And the boy, Encolpio.
Shall we split him too?
(cackles)
- Don't joke.
- Let's let him decide.
- With you.
- (Ascilto laughs)
No! No!
(sobs)
(rumbling)
- (woman whimpers)
- Garizio.
(rumbling)
(screaming)
Ganymede... Narcissus.
And there's Apollo, who turned a young man's shadow into a flower.
It is sickening how all the tales are of love, of unions sensual, unrivalled sick.
I have taken into my heart a cruel love.
You see before you a poet.
You do not believe it,
I am dressed so maggoty?
Precisely the point.
Passionate pursuit of art has never meant riches.
Never. A comforting thought, how poverty is sister to genius.
I am very poor and my name, it is Eumolpo.
I show you masterpieces which could not be painted today.
They don't have the energy today.
The whole of civilisation, shagged out.
And what is the reason for this sad fact of dilapidation?
A brabble stammer of money. Greed.
Time's flown. Ideals such as virtue pure and simple flourished, and art left.
That fellow Eudosso grew old in the mountains, watching the stars.
Lysippus, all his life, drew a single model and died famished.
In our case, wine and women have put such masterpieces completely out of our cognisance!
What has happened to dialectical discussion? And what of astronomy?
We don't know of it for all the copulation we do, you see.
You are not to wonder that the art of painting is dead, young man.
We all of us see more beauty in a bag of gold - I do - than all the work of Apelles or Phidias.
Those Greeks! Too much!
I'm as bad, you see. I caught Trimalcione, who's rich out of his ears.
You've never seen such riches.
He grows lemons, pepper, wool.
Suppose you took a fancy to a glass of hen's milk. He'd give you a gallon.
And he's dirt, no better!
Come up from nothing.
No breeding whatever! And the agony of it is, he thinks he's a poet!
Puerile verses.
No trace of soul, grace, poetry.
And what does the bastard call me?
"Colleague". "Fellow poet".
"Soul of mine". Cheek!
Still, always sit at his table and drink his best wine. His invitation...
You only escape torture because you're a citizen of Rome!
But that leaves my slaves free to cudgel you!
Bollocks for starters! Bollocks, you cyst.
Your back should be whipped until it's broken!
It was broken by that ruffian your son!
- I'll prison you in the galleries!
- Pendulous fart!
(trilling)
(chanting)
(trilling)
Hey, never mind.
Even Venus was cross-eyed.
(girls titter)
(bell tolls)
(man shouts)
(shouting)
Eumolpo, it's so very good of you to turn up.
Because you're a friend, your presence is always commodious. You're like me.
- Too much honour.
- Bursting with genius.
Between us poets, there's real love.
(band plays)
(proposes a toast)
Friends, I beg of you, sample my wine. Do it honour.
It costs me nothing.
Fish have to swim. Cows graze all day.
I merely cook 'em up, and sell them.
All comes from me own property, wherever that is.
Taranto and Terracina.
My dream is owning the whole of Sicily, so I might perambulate or equitate or marinate by sea all the way to Africa and never once leave my own estates.
Similar to the questing Ulysses,
I should level.
You catch the comparison?
A little culture at table never does no harm.
Here is the very first beard that I ever grew.
I was fully grown at 14!
And these are my household gods, protect all our property.
Good for fortune, for business, for profit.
Praise them, thank you very much.
- Who the hell are you?
- Work in the kitchen.
- Were you born here or did I buy you?
- Not the one or the other.
I was left to you in a testament of Pansa.
Right, then. You cook sublime and big or I shall have you cooking slops with the other swine minders.
Heard the one about the rich man and the poor man...
- What is a poor man?
- (laughter)
Bravo. Quite a good one.
(groans)
I'm going off to be sick.
How time do fly. Day slips and night's on you before you're ready.
The only way is to run out of bed straight to dinner.
So cold. Not warm. Chilly.
Not even warm in the bath, is it?
Men are less than flies, much less.
They have a certain resistance, flies.
No doubt we're bubbles is all.
Here today, gone tomorrow. Bit of this, bit of that, as the peasant said to the pig.
This man could turn lead to gold.
Hair black as a crow.
Over 70 years old, he was, and still at it.
Not least in peril of rape was the house dog.
(trilling)
(cheering)
Are you telling me that's cooked?
How dare you present it!
It's not even gutted. How dare you!
The cook! At once!
You cooked this pig? Guts and all?
- Have pity, my saviour.
- Lash him!
I'm sorry. I did wrong. Have pity!
All right, then, you pitiful pisspots.
Disembowel it - here, now.
(applause)
Marvel upon marvel!
Look what tumbles forth.
Thrushes, stuffed hens, eggs, livers of birds, rope on rope of sausage, tender plucked pigeons, snails, liver wrapped in fat, ham and lungs.
Oh, Trimalcione, your name will live!
Eumolpo!
(laughter)
What are you laughing at?
Don't you laugh at my master.
So you're richer, eh?
You give better dinners, my Lord?
You piss-quick, malodorous vagabond!
You stink.
All right, then. Son of the emperor?
We've all seen you raping the goat.
- I laugh because I laugh.
- Hold your pisser! How it stinks! Foul.
Smelly. Ugh!
I bought my own freedom.
You, have you done as much?
I feed 20 bodies and a dog.
My wife - bought her freedom.
So keep your hands off her tits, you fart!
- Try not to inflame him.
- You are merely a fart on the water.
Better close your trap, Hermerote.
Patience, patience. The rascal is young.
He's only crowing.
When you were young, you crowed too.
Give us some Homer, then. Commence.
(speaks Ancient Greek)
(Trimalcione)
At table, my pleasure is Greek.
(applause)
Eumolpo, brother poet, have you followed the story?
Might I convolute a little on it for you?
It seems Diomedes...
Lo and behold, our master's mosaic!
(Eumolpo speaks Latin)
Eumolpo, sit down before you topple.
Cudding nausea!
Race of slaves! Filth!
When did you pay for a 20th of your freedom?
Suckers of chancres, lickers of lies, shit-eating mange!
Eumolpo, console yourself in the fact we poets have a difficult time of it.
Hearken to this perspication:
"Everything works out by chance,
Destiny so trips the dance.
Fortune never spares a glance.
Better the cup to circumstance."
And these verses are mine.
Horace! Heigh-ho!
A beautiful new Horace!
(sings)
Dance, then!
No!
Oh, you misery. Go on!
Dance!
On 26th July, the following slaves were born to Trimalcione on his Cumae estate: male 30, female 40.
Same day saw crucified the slave Eusavio for bestial insults against our master.
Calves born: 26.
Same day, some set fire to the Pompeiian orchards of Trimalcione.
Come again.
When did I buy orchards in Pompeii?
Wine! Actually, hot water.
Sorry we're late.
We were kept at a banquet - funeral in the house of Scissa, for a slave.
He poured wine over her bones.
They had everything but you, Trimalcione.
Blood sausage, cake with Spanish honey dripping, a snail to each person.
And main course - a bear with eggs in pastry cases.
She so golloped it down, my wife, she spewed it all up again out of her stomach.
She said "If bears eat people, people can eat bears, then!"
Hey, Scinti, Fortunata, what are you up to?
I'll bang your heads together.
I'll be richer and fatter if I don't have your tits off when we get home!
(laughter)
(belches)
How's that sound, fortune teller?
The sound is limpid.
That presages developments.
Are you expecting a visitor?
Try again.
(belches)
That's nice. I am very happy for you.
Fanciful dear boy, regular to me.
Very rompish.
Come here. Sit on my knee.
Come and sit by your old uncle.
(Trimalcione recites rhyme)
(Vulgar Latin)
Leave me alone! We all know you were born in the market. I transformed you...
Got any more to say?
Architect, take the statue of this harpy off my monuments!
- Don't shout at me.
- You miserable old fungus!
So vicious, so brutish. Ugh!
Old and ugly, you are.
(laughter)
Fetched from a market to a house fit for an empress.
Look at you! Gobbling like a turkey.
I'll make you suffer.
I'll make you eat your turds.
I love this ragamuffin because he's clever, not because he's beautiful.
He can divide by ten, read a book, and has bought a chair for himself.
What, still complaining, fatty?
Remember that this luxury you enjoy is due to me.
I submitted to my master's pleasure.
For 14 years he used me for his passion.
Whatever I do, the master commands.
But I helped the mistress to joy also.
I became joint heir with the emperor and built five ships, loaded them with pigs, perfume and slaves, and founded a fortune, didn't I?
All that I touched grew and grew.
Once I was a cockroach, now I'm a king. Such is life.
You, steward, prepare for me my panoply of death and unguent.
Put a sample of wine before me, such as will be used to wash me bones.
Life passes like a shadow.
Sooner or later, death comes to us all.
Comes to me mind some poetry.
Hearken now.
"The company here represents a mime.
One actor plays a father, one actor plays a son, a third plays rich old age.
But at the comedy's finish, consider the false faces returning to reality."
- How's that for poetry, eh, poet?
- So I am to tell the truth?
- Those verses you robbed from Lucrezio.
- What did you say, vagabond?
"Consider the false faces returning to reality."
That's Lucrezio! That's Lucrezio!
Bastard! How dare you question my verses!
It is I's the poet, not you!
- You don't scribble verses...
- Push him into the oven.
Question my talent? Into the fire!
I fed you, nourished you in this house.
I'm the poet!
Bang him into the furnace. Ingrate!
You dare...
Pass him off and spit him! Away with him.
A serpent at me breast.
Never see him again!
(Eumolpo) You can't treat a philosopher so! I'm an artist!
I tell you, solely queens and emperors have such a monument funereal as mine.
Abinna is making it a work of art.
Oh, what a tomb.
Covered in marble and gold.
On the front, over 120 foot high, frescoes of the life of Trimalcione.
We see his ships in full sail, plus the statue of his favourite dog.
And what about his epitaph?
"Here lies Gaius Pompeius Trimalcione."
"Philanthropist, benefactor.
He was pious to a fault."
"Very brave, self-made."
"Left 30 million sesterces."
"Never asked much of philosophy and the same to you."
Fate has it you are invited to my beatific funeral, and must eat, drink and think nice things of me.
Chant some songs, play beautiful music very soft.
(chanting)
Adieu, adieu. Fare you well.
Now mourn for me. I am dead.
Mourn for Gaius Pompeius Trimalcione.
Mourn for Trimalcione.
Trimalcione!
Trimalcione!
Oh, such a great man! (sobs)
Oh, a person much loved indeed.
Oh, why could I not die with him?
I want to give you a present.
Here, take this bracelet.
Solid gold. Here, take it.
And me, eh? Me? What about me?
What about your earrings?
Toss 'em out.
Toss 'em all out, the greedy swine.
And get my bracelet back from that black.
Not a soul may tell us, for none come back ready to talk of the mortuary.
We will never know what is death.
We all know what is life, don't we, then?
The story of the Matron of Ephesus, you all know.
It starts "There was this lovely young widow, beautiful and virtuous."
She'd just become a widow.
(keening)
You see her weeping, faithful to the end.
She will not leave the tomb.
What love she has, what grief.
She do! Night and day she do!
Five days without
is a long time without within.
She is left, starving herself to death.
Outside, nearby, is this thief
hanging up, swinging.
The corpse must not be took off and
to see so is a beautiful young soldier.
(woman weeps)
See, you are starving to death.
How can you serve love by death?
You must drink something.
You must drink. Take it.
You deserve life.
God-given joys of life, as long as possible.
Put the question to the corpse here.
He does not need convincing.
Please drink a little.
The hanged man has been cut down!
While I was here in the tomb, the robbers' parents must have carried his body away.
I shall certainly be punished with death myself. A horrible death!
But why do I tarry?
I prefer death at my own hands.
No! No, my dear.
To lose two men in my life, one after the other, would be too much.
Better to hang up a dead husband than lose a living lover.
"Better to hang up a dead husband than lose a living lover."
(laughter)
Poets may die, Encolpio.
But what import if poetry remains?
Friend, my friend.
Companion of my dying moments.
You will say
"I cocked Eumolpo the poet."
You will say "Ah, yes..."
Yes, dear.
Should I have riches of Trimalcione,
I'd leave you a pond, a navy, ships with sailor boys.
But all I can leave you is what I have enjoyed myself, which is...
- Which is?
- Which is... I leave you poetry.
I leave the seasons, most bright-jewelled spring and yellow summer.
I leave the wind in change, the sun in bloom, the sea, kind sea-wash.
I leave the earth, kinder again.
The mountains, their torrents of water, clear tears, and the great shapely clouds pass so solemn in the sky.
Light as puff.
See them, yours, dear, as remembrances of our hands that touched our lips.
I leave you arbours of trees, birds and animals.
Light love, sad love and the stars,
Encolpio, I leave you.
Noises, song, rumour.
The voices of man, the pealing of musical bells,
I leave you.
Bittersweet. My eyes' drug.
Gitone, I love you still.
Speak to me, dream love.
You left me for another.
Do I deserve...
(grunting)
(impatient shouting)
Terror. We are fallen
into the hands of Lichas of Taranto,
a thrice-dotted villain who combs
the sea for precious objects, people.
People like us who are beautiful
and will give pleasure to Caesar.
Gitone is beautiful. My love is beautiful.
We are doomed to be the playthings of the
solitary, diseased Caesar on his island.
Wretched fate has me by the balls again,
swinging on them.
So near my love, and yet so far, my love.
Please to remove your tunic so I try it on my shoulders.
- Give me!
- No!
Hey.
(chanting)
- Hail to Caesar!
- (all) Hail to Caesar!
(sings)
Ein gutes Fressen f黵 die Haie.
He's much too beautiful.
Don't bruise this one.
(whispers)
Come, come closer.
Legs as smooth as velvet.
Aagh!
A body so bland, so soft.
Ohh! Oh, you're pretty.
... einen h黚schen neuen Herrn
und dann wird die Hochzeit sein
mit viel Liebe
und die sch鰊e Nacht und so.
(shouts order)
All hail to the bride!
(giggles)
(Ascilto laughs)
All this treasure is bound for Caesar, but the sweetest is mine.
The colour is sanguine, is vital and gives us joy.
The blood shows that the gods bless this union.
Lichas, take the hand of your husband.
Know this union is for ever and cannot be sundered.
You, spouse, do vow faithful love as your wife did.
All your boys must be obediently forgot.
A married man takes no liberty.
You do now dedicate yourself and your energy to your bride.
Strive for harmony, strive for satisfaction.
Strive for complete happiness, for weddings consummate at sea are favoured by Venus with issue.
Now say the ritual words.
(recites rite)
(all chant) Felicitas!
(chanting) Felicitas!
Felicitas! Felicitas!
(man sings)
And the god appeared to him with these words:
"Should you desire an equal fate, you may live half your life in the bowels of the earth, the other half high in a golden dwelling of the sky."
(sings)
(Encolpio)
So to Caesar his treasure chest sails.
But my married bliss was not to be.
Approaching the island of Taunia
where young Caesar loved
to live and watched for us,
one morning, out the blue,
came armed ships and a new Caesar.
(shouts order)
- The tyrant is dead.
- (all chant)
This little lamb is coming with us.
You trespass on my ship!
The ship is no longer yours, Lichas.
Caesar is murdered.
The new Caesar arrives.
The boy emperor's torn open like a fruit, squashed in the market.
Treacherous tart!
- Yes?
- I wish to see don Medina.
- My name...
- I'm sorry.
Don Medina is not receiving visitors at present.
You will announce that
Mr. Francis Barnard...
...has come from England to see him.
What do you think you're doing?
Remove your hand, sir.
Maximillian.
What is it ?
This gentleman demands to be admitted, Dona.
- I've told him...
- You are Dona Medina?
I am.
I am Francis Barnard,
Elizabeth's brother.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Won't you come in, Mr. Barnard?
Please forgive me.
I'm Catherine Medina.
Dona.
Would you not spend the night
Mr. Barnard?
I am certain my brother would wish it.
Perhaps Dona. May I see your brother now?
He is resting.
He has not been well since the death.
I see. When may I see him?
Perhaps at supper...
...if you will do us the honor.
I will... supper.
May I visit my sister's grave, now?
Grave?
I presume there is one.
Not as such, Mister Barnard.
She is interred below.
A family custom,
Mr. Barnard.
I see.
If we may go there then?
Please follow me.
When did she die?
Your brother's letter made no mention of the day.
About three months ago.
Three months? Why wasn't I notified sooner?
I'm afraid I...
How did she die?
I know very little of the details, Mr. Barnard.
This is no longer my home, you see?
I left it several months before...
...Nicholas married your sister.
Meaning you don't even...
Damn Heaven!
What's that noise?
Please follow me, Mr. Barnard.
Not that way, Mr. Barnard!
Who are you?
This is Mr. Barnard, Nicholas.
Elizabeth's brother.
Oh, yes.
You are welcome, mister.
Resting, dona Medina?
Sir?
I told Mr. Barnard that you were resting, Nicholas.
I thought that you were.
That noise, sir.
This is an apparatus...
...that must be kept in constant repair.
What brings you to us?
Elizabeth was my sister, don Medina.
I received your report of her untimely death...
...the report that was utterly devoid of detail. what should I have done, remained in England?
Yes, you are quite right.
My apology, sir.
Shock and grief...
...restrained me from more adequate communication.
You have every right to be provoked.
Perhaps you will show me my sister's place of interment now.
I told him it would be alright, Nicholas.
Yes, of course.
Now perhaps you'll be good enough to tell me how my sister died.
In the illness of some duration, sir.
And was this illness diagnosed?
- Yes.
- By whom?
Dr. Leon, the physician of repute.
And he decided?
Something in her blood.
Yes?
That's all?
Just something in her blood?
I'm afraid so.
And I'm afraid that does not satisfy me, sir.
Follow me.
May we go now, Mr. Barnard?
This is very painful for my brother.
And for me...as well.
This form of burial...
...is our family custom,
Mr. Barnard.
Will you stay the night with us?
The night...
...and more, sir.
Until I know exactly what has happened to her.
Thank you.
Yes?
I trust that you will be comfortable here.
Is this you?
No.
No, that is my father,
Sebastian Medina.
Sebastian Medina, yes.
The resemblance is remarkable.
Yes.
And the other is my uncle Bartholomew.
Mr. Barnard, I am aware, painfully aware...
...of your distrust regarding
Elizabeth's death.
Her death was, and is, anguish to me.
I beg of you do not add to it...
I'm sorry, don Medina, but your word is not enough.
Too many things need fuller explanation...
...before I can be satisfied that what you say is true.
Fuller explanation?
Yes.
Come with me.
Please, come.
The atmosphere is heavy in here.
Why have you brought me here?
It is her room, sir.
I've had it kept exactly as she left it.
Look around you sir.
This room was furnished and arranged with dedicated love.
Every article of furniture every decorative detail...
...is the work of a master craftsman...
...of Italy, of Spain or France.
Indeed every country in the civilized world...
...is represented here.
It is unique room.
I did it all for her.
I wanted her to have something that...
Maria
I beg your pardon, sir.
I was just cleaning up.
Oh, yes, yes of course.
You may go now.
Is this all you meant to tell me?
You are an unyielding man,
Mr. Barnard.
I am forced to be, sir.
God is my witness
I worshipped your sister
I worship her still.
Without her, life is meaningless.
She was that substance of loveliness.
I tried to capture it...
...but it was the way she walked and moved...
...her smile, her voice.
She sang like an angel.
And she could play the harpsichord...
...as no other woman I've ever known could play.
Every night after we have dined...
...she would play for me.
Please, forgive me.
I have not intended to so display myself.
I pray...
...I pray you leave me for awhile.
Please, go.
Do you live in London, Mr. Barnard?
Yes, and you?
In Barcelona, with an aunt.
And have you been here long?
A little over a week.
I came to be with
Nicholas because I...
Who would that be?
Nicholas.
How are you, my friend?
You look pale.
Slept badly, have you?
Charles, we have a visitor.
Well, splendid, splendid.
- Exactly what you need.
- Charles.
It's Elizabeth's brother.
- You mean...
- Yes.
Dr. Charles Leon at your service, sir.
Doctor.
You are I understand it
Elizabeth's brother.
The resemblance is clear.
The coloring, the same configuration.
Beautiful woman your sister.
- Doctor.
- Ah, dear.
I interrupted your meal, I see.
Proper timing was never my fault.
We have just finished. Won't you join us in a glass of wine, Charles?
Delighted.
So, young gentleman, you've come all the way from England, then? 
That's right.
Terrible tragedy your sister's death.
Appalling business.
How are things in Baztan, Charles?
What?
Always, always, Nicholas...
...buying and selling living and dying.
The weave of life.
Why did my sister die,
Dr. Leon?
Have you not been told?
- Of course he has.
- Well then?.
I want to hear it from you doctor.
Her death was inevitable,
I fear...
...under the circumstances.
This castle, this odious atmosphere.
What has the castle to do with it?
What has the castle...?
It's too late now, Charles.
I did not want him to know.
Know what?
Your sister's death was caused by failure of the heart, sir...
...due to total shock.
Literally, she died of fright.
- Why did you not tell me?
- I thought to spare you, sir.
You thought to deceive me!
- That is not true.
- What is all this?
Show me where it happened.
- Very well.
- No, Nicholas.
There is no other way, my dear.
We were wrong, very wrong to have kept the truth from Mr. Barnard.
Now we are doubly suspect in his eyes.
Suspect?
Come.
Nicholas, you should not be doing this, you know.
- You are not well.
- It cannot be avoided, Charles.
Come.
Well?
Torture chamber?
Yes, Mr. Barnard.
It was my father's.
Sebastian Medina.
One of the inquisition's most infamous, degrading...
- Sir, that is enough.
- Mr. Barnard, can you not see?
What was my sister doing here?
She could not keep herself away.
That noise I heard, is that what was...
No, sir. That particular device...
...was not in operation at the time.
Which device?
It's in the adjoining chamber down there.
Please, Mr. Barnard, do not go there...
I do not wish to discuss it.
The story, sir.
In detail.
This was my father's world,
Mr. Barnard.
Spare yourself at least this, Nicholas.
How can I spare myself?
Was he not my father?
Am I not the spawn of his...
...his depraved blood?
His depravity is not yours, Nicholas.
Why scourge yourself because of it?
You have not answered me, don Medina.
I shall not dwell upon the history of this...
...this blasphemous chamber.
Suffice it that the blood of a thousand men and women...
...was spilt within these walls.
Limbs twisted and broken!
Eyes gouged from bloody sockets...
...flesh burned black.
Why are you telling me these things?
What do they have to do with my sister?
She had never been brought here.
She was too sensitive, too aware.
Aware of what?
The malignant atmosphere of this castle.
It destroyed her.
My sister was a strong and willful woman...
...not subject to the influence of atmospheres.
You have been here only a matter of hours, Mr. Barnard.
You cannot know what it is to live here...
...month upon month, year after year...
...breathing this infernal air...
...absorbing the miasma of barbarity...
...which permeates these walls...
...particularly this chamber.
But it did not bother her at first either.
Our life was good...
...rich with the shared pleasures of our love.
Each morning I would bring her breakfast.
In the afternoons, she usually sat for me while I attempted all in vain...
...to capture her beauty on canvas.
I did that portrait which you saw on her room before...
...but it is all inadequate to what I called the loveliness of her.
We dined, sometimes alone, enjoying intimate conversation...
...sometimes with the doctor.
And every night
Elisabeth would play for me.
Life was simple, quiet, richly pleasurable...
...and then the darkness began to fall.
More and more entering her room in the mornings...
...I would find her awake and discover that she had not slept all the night.
I tried to find out why, but she had no explanation.
Her appetite began to fade.
She began to lose weight and color.
I tried to make her eat...
...but something kept her from it.
I would come upon her wandering in the corridors at night.
I tried to find out what was wrong...
...but she never had an answer...
...except to say that... that something was oppressing her.
Oh God, help me for my blindness.
I should have known...
Then one day she disappeared.
Frantic, I searched the castle for her.
And then I knew.
The castle and its awful history had obsessed her.
These very instruments of torture...
...which were my birthright and my curse...
...now tormented her as well...
...infecting her with a kind of haunted fascination.
And watched her drawn to one and then another...
...as if the aura of pain and suffering which surrounded them...
...was luring her to sickness...
...and to death.
Immediately I made my plans to leave the castle with her.
We would travel for a while, restore her spirits...
...and then make our home elsewhere.
Then on the very eve of our departure...
...we heard her scream from below...
...the most hideous blood-chilling scream...
...I have ever heard in my life.
Just before she died, she whispered a name.
Sebastian.
Sebastian.
Mr. Barnard.
Dona.
May I speak with you?
Yes, of course.
How is your brother?
Better, thank you.
Dr. Leon is staying with him.
I have come to ask you to please believe him, Mr. Barnard.
He has told you the truth.
Has he?
Yes. And not telling you before...
...he only meant to spare you pain.
He is a good man, Mr. Barnard...
...a kind and gentle man...
...and I know that he adored your sister.
I would like to believe him,
Dona Medina...
...but I find it very difficult to do so.
There is something about him
I cannot help at sense...
...kind of fearful tension that...
I am sorry...
...but an air of definite guilt.
Of course he suffers from guilt
Mr. Barnard...
...because of what our father did...
...because of what happened to
Elizabeth.
Perhaps it will help you to understand...
...if I tell you something that happened to Nicholas...
...when he was just a boy.
One day, while Nicholas was playing...
...in a lower corridor...
He had been forbidden by our father...
...to enter this chamber at any time.
The curiosity of youth, however...
...overcame his fear of challenging our father's discipline.
He had to see the chamber.
Suddenly, there were footsteps.
It was our father.
With him were our mother and our uncle Bartholomew...
...who was our father's brother.
At first it appeared that for some inexplicable reason...
...our father was actually...
...conducting them on a tour of his ghastly chamber.
Nicholas could see that both our mother and our uncle...
...were uneasy, frightened.
Our father's smiling affability...
...as he described the workings of these hellish instruments...
...turned Nicholas' blood cold.
He watched them with a mounting sense of premonition.
Something was wrong, most terribly wrong.
Even he, no more than
10 years of age...
...could sense it like a darkening vapor in the air.
There was no reason...
...for our mother and our uncle to have been there.
As he struck, he kept on screaming at his brother...
...one word, over and over.
"Adulterer! Adulterer!"
And then he turned on her.
Accusing her of vile debauchery with his brother...
...cursing her as faithless...
...promising her the agonies of hell...
...and payment for her infidelity...
...and then before my brother's very eyes...
...our mother was tortured to death.
Ever since then...
...Nicholas has been unable to live as other men.
Always he is haunted by the memory...
...of that terrible day..
Your sister's death...
...came very close to driving, him insane, Mr. Barnard.
I beg of you...
...have pity on him.
Help him by believing him.
I will try, dona Medina.
Well, I know you must be very tired from your journey.
Good night.
Dona.
Who is that?
I'll see.
Where's Nicholas?
He is gone?
I must have dozed off in that chair...
...and I heard...
I don't understand.
It is surely your brother.
No, Nicholas has never played the harpsichord in his life.
Maria.
I heard the playing, sir.
Go back to bed, child.
Nicholas!
It was Elizabeth.
You saw her?
I did not have to see her.
I know her playing
Locked?
Yes.
Is there another door?
There is not, sir.
My sister's?
Easy, easy.
It was she.
Up, take this.
Thank you.
Hers?
Yes.
You will sleep in a minute or so.
Doctor, will you stay please?
Yes, of course, my dear.
Until the morning, at any rate.
My dear Lord.
It is hers, isn't it?
- It is.
- But how?
Let us not talk yet.
May we use your room, sir?
Yes, of course.
Sit.
What I am about to tell you...
...no one in this world except
Nicholas and myself knows.
That is, I thought that no one else knew.
Take this.
No, thank...
Drink it.
To be absolutely blunt about it...
...Nicholas believes that Elizabeth may have been interred prematurely.
What?
I hasten to assure you both...
...that such is not the case.
Elizabeth was quite dead.
I would stick my reputation on that fact.
Then why...
...does he believe it?
Because of what happened to his mother many years ago.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I told mister Barnard what Nicholas saw that day.
No, my dear. Your mother was not tortured to death...
...as you were told.
But...
She was tortured, yes...
...but not to death.
Do I make myself clear?
Do you mean to say that...?
Your mother was walled up in her tomb while yet alive.
Oh, no.
From that day forth...
...the very thought of premature interment...
...was enough to drive your brother into convulsions of horror.
Nicholas broods about it constantly.
Already he has told me he has heard Elizabeth's walking the corridors...
...even that he has heard her speaking his name.
- Dr. Leon.
- Sir?
You seem to forget that we all heard the harpsichord playing.
No, I have not forgotten that, sir.
It is why I said before that I thought...
...that no one but Nicholas and myself knew about this.
What do you mean?
Someone, I fear, has discovered
Nicholas' secret...
...and is using it as a terrible advantage
The servant, perhaps.
I could almost more easily believe that...
That what, Dona Medina?
Nothing.
I spoke without thought.
I want to know one thing, sir.
Are you absolutely positive...
...that don Medina's dread is unwarranted?
If Elizabeth Medina walks the corridors of this castle...
...it is her spirit, not her living self.
- Where did it come from?
- Elizabeth's room.
What is it, child?
Easy, child. Easy..
But tell us what happened to you.
I... I... I heard her.
Heard?
The mistress.
I was cleaning up the room...
...and she spoke to me.
She called me by my name, Maria.
She said, "Maria, leave this room".
My wife spoke to you?
-My wife spoke...
-Nicholas!
No one will ever enter that room again.
- Mister Barnard, I...
- No need explaining, Nicholas.
Mister Barnard knows everything.
Take care of the girl, will you Catherine.
I'll see to it, dona Medina, if you want to go with your brother.
Thank you.
Come, Maria, let me help you downstairs.
Perhaps I should bring some food to Nicholas.
He will not eat it, my dear...
...any more than you are eating yours. 
I am not hungry.
You need your strength, nonetheless.
If I may interrupt this fascinating conversation for a moment...
...how long, may I ask, you intend to accept these occurrences...
...face value?
I should have thought, mister Barnard that a man of your investigative zeal...
...would have already solved the mystery.
And have you, doctor?
I am not certain.
But you remember that no one actually heard Elizabeth's voice?
We have only Maria's word for it.
We proceed on similar lines, doctor.
On questioning Maria, I asked her to describe the voice she heard.
- And?
- She could not describe it, doctor...
...because it only whispered to her.
This point seems of vital import to you, doesn't it?
Don Medina!
Don Medina!
The key to Elizabeth's room..
The key, I said!
Again?
Do not go there, Nicholas.
I must, Catherine.
Nicholas!
Come.
What I have dreaded all these months...
...has come to pass.
You are wrong, Nicholas.
No. She haunts me...
...because of the terrible thing
I did to her...
Mister Barnard!
What in the name of heaven?
And have you nothing to say, don Medina?
I don't understand, sir.
Do you not, sir?
Then, with your permission, I will enlighten you.
What is the meaning of this?
The meaning, doctor, is this: only one person in this castle...
...could have caused all these inexplicable occurrences.
That person is don Medina.
- What?
- You are mad, sir.
Am I?
Mister Barnard, I swear that I...
The secret passage, sir...
...how convenient for you.
Enabling you to whisper to
Maria without being seen.
Then after the door to Elizabeth's room had been...
...locked by YOU, enabling you to return there and...
...at your leisure demolish everything.
- You are wrong, sir. I swear I...
- You are lying, sir!
When Maria screamed, where were you?
When Elizabeth's room was being torn apart, where were you?
How you are not investigating that?
I was afraid.
You lie!
Both times you were in
Elizabeth's room yourself!
Both times your own door was locked...
...protecting you from discovery.
No, that's not true! It's not true!
Why should Nicholas do these things?
Why!?
Is it possible?
Is it possible I am doing these things unaware?
To punish myself?
No, Nicholas!
One of the servants was responsible
Most likely Maria.
Could I have kept that ring without knowing it?
Play the harpsichord without knowing it?
Destroy Elizabeth's room all without knowing it?
My inner mind...
...creating evidence of Elizabeth's vengeful return....
...because that mind knows...
But I don't know!
I will find out.
No.
It's the only way, Catherine.
And it's the only way I...
I must be sure!
I must be sure.
Can you not stop this?
I do not believe I wish to stop it, my dear.
If this is the only way of convincing Nicholas...
...that he did not bury his wife alive then
I say by all means- do it.
This groundless dread...
...must finally be put to rest.
We will exhume Elizabeth.
True.
True!
I swear to you I thought she was dead.
On my honors of physician I thought she was dead.
I swear to you!
True.
True.
True
It's true.!
No, Nicholas!
It's true.
Nicholas!
I killed her.
I killed her.
No, Nicholas.
I killed her. I killed her.
Nicholas.
I would suggest, Nicholas, that you leave this place.
Your remaining here cannot help Elizabeth now.
Try to understand, Nicholas.
I am a doctor of medicine.
Never in my career have I seen a condition which so completely...
... paralleled the physical appearance...
...of dead.
You cannot feel responsible, Nicholas.
While we were up here mourning...
...and she was alive, struggling to be free.
I am responsible.
If it were not so...
...she would not want to haunt me
She does not haunt you, Nicholas.
Can you not see that? It is you punishing yourself.
I must leave in the morning.
Already I have been grossly negligent...
...of my other patients.
I beg of you- leave with me.
I can never leave.
I must accept whatever vengeance...
...Elizabeth chooses to inflict upon me.
Dona Medina? Dona Medina?
What is it, Mister Barnard?
May I speak with you?
- Certainly.
- I came to apologize.
Apologize?
But everything you said...
I know that my suspicions were justified...
...but not as I had expected.
I realize now that my sister's death...
...was an accident.
I do not blame your brother.
I feel only sympathy for him.
What I did was, I assure you, only because of Elizabeth.
I think I understand.
I am sorry that our meeting...
...should have taken place under such unhappy circumstances.
Had things been otherwise...
Perhaps we should meet again...
...in Barcelona.
I hope so.
Good night, Dona.
Good night.
- Doctor.
- Where are you going, sir?
- To apologize to don Medina.
- I wouldn't speak to him just now.
He is much overwrought.
In the morning, perhaps.
- You will be leaving then?
- Yes.
Will you accept the hospitality of my carriage?
Thank you, doctor. Good night.
Good night, mister Barnard.
Nicholas.
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
Nicholas.
Nicholas.
Elizabeth?
Where are you?
Elizabeth?
Where are you?
Nicholas?
Is my brother with you?
- No. Is he not in his room?
- No.
He must be with Dr. Leon then.
Nicholas.
I will check below.
You two search this floor and the one above.
All right
Nicholas.
Is that you?
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
Nicholas!
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
Nicholas.
Nicholas.
Nicholas!
I told you to wait.
I couldn't.
He is gone.
What about my brother?
He is supposed to leave in the morning..
...but now...
Why couldn't you wait one more day?
I've waited too long already.
Oh, my darling Nicholas...
...we've broken you at last.
Elizabeth, there is no time for this.
I've waited an eternity for this moment.
There has to be time.
And now, my dear Nicholas...
...I have you exactly as I want you...
...helpless.
Elizabeth.
Is it not ironical, my husband?
Your wife, an adulteress.
Your mother, an adulteress.
Your uncle, an adulterer.
Your closest friend, an adulterer.
Do you not find that amusing, dear Nicholas?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes!
Yes!
What's happening to him?
Happening?
What should be happening, lsabella? lsabella?
You, Bartholomew, my brother...
...how do you like my little workshop?
Dear God!
What ails you, brother, huh?
And you, my dear, why are you so pale?
Does this place disturb you?
I thought the two of you would enjoy...
...the novelty of it.
Come, let me show you about a bit.
Where are you going, lsabella?
Bartholomew!
Are you leaving me?
Don't you want to see my...?
I am going to torture you, lsabella.
I am going to make you suffer for your faithlessness to me.
Before this day is out...
...you will be begging me to kill you...
...to relieve you of the agony of hell..
...into which your husband is about to plunge you.
Harlot!
You will die in agony!
Die!
Now, Bartholomew, my brother...
Bartholomew!
Bartholomew!
Where are you?
You cannot hide from me, you know.
Don Medina?
Don Medina!
There you are, Bartholomew!
Ah, there you are, sir.
We've been searching all over for you.
And now for you Bartholomew, my beloved brother...
...while you are still alive...
...my ultimate device of torture.
Are you ready now, Bartholomew?
Bartholomew?
Now we are ready to begin, Bartholomew.
Do you know where you are, Bartholomew?
Don Medina, I am Francis Barnard.
I will tell you where you are.
You are about to enter hell, Bartholomew.
Hell!
The Netherworld.
The infernal region.
The abode of the damned.
The place of torment.
Pandemonium.
"Abbadon, "Tophet", "Gehenna".
"Naraka", the pit!
And the pendulum.
The razor edge of destiny.
That's the condition of man.
Bound on an island from which he can never hope to escape...
...surrounded by the waiting pit of hell.
Subject to the inexorable pendulum of fate...
...which must destroy him finally.
Nicholas?
Nicholas, are you in there?
Catherine, help me!
Nicholas?
Nicholas!
Maximillian! Maximillian!
We must break into the torture chamber. Quickly!.
Maximillian!
Don Medina- he thought that
I was...
It's over now.
Nicholas.
No one will ever enter this room again.

FOUND VENT IN ONE LOUD, LONG,
AND FINAL SCREAM OF DESPAIR"...POE
[MUSIC - "HOORAY FOR SANTA
CLAUS"]
NEWS ANCHOR (ON
TV): At this time,
Station KID-TV brings you the special event of the year, a first in television history.
At this very moment,
KID-TV has standing by a television crew at
Santa Claus' workshop.
And in just a few seconds, our special correspondent,
Andy Henderson, will bring you a person to person interview with Santa Claus himself, direct from the North Pole, where at the moment, the temperature is 91 degrees below zero.
And now KID-TV takes you via Telstar,
Andy Henderson at the North Pole.
ANDY HENDERSON
(ON TV): Hi, kids.
This is Andy Henderson at the North Pole.
Whoo, it's cold up here.
From this spot, there's only one direction you can go, and that's south.
Living up here is pretty rough.
I don't see how Santa stands it.
Since we've been here, we've eaten nothing but frozen food.
At least, that's the way it is by the time we get it.
And now, let's take a looksee into Santa's workshop.
Hello again.
Boys and girls, it's just weeks before Christmas, and Santa and his helpers are working overtime to make sure that there's enough toys for the kids all over the world.
Santa's a pretty busy man, but I'm sure he'd like to say a few words to you kids.
Hello, Santa.
SANTA CLAUS (ON
TV): Oh, hello, son.
Oh, well, hello boys and girls.
Hey... oh, Andy, you caught me at a very busy time.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): Well, uh, you think you'll be ready by Christmas Eve?
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Well, we've never disappointed the kids yet.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Tell me, is it true that this year, there's a rumor that you're going to use a rocket sled?
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): No sir-ee.
We're going out the good old fashioned way, with my reindeer... Prancer and
Dancer, and Donner and Blitzen, and Vixen and
Nixon... hey, Nixon?
Oh, where'd I get... Oh,
I always... confound it.
I get those names mixed up.
But the kids know their names.
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV):
Santa, there you are.
We have so much to do, and you stand here dawdling, talking to this visitor.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Mr.
Anderson, this is Mrs. Claus.
Uh, well, dear, we're on television.
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV): How do you do, Mr. Anderson.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Ma'am.
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV):
Now, I want you to go and finish painting those hobby horses.
Television?
Did you say we're on television?
Oh, oh dear.
Oh, why didn't you tell me?
Oh, my hair's a mess.
Mm-mm... H-hello there.
Oh, oh!
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Come along, Mr. Anderson, and I'll show you some of the new toys we're turning out.
How's it going, Winky?
WINKY (ON TV): Everything is A-OK, Santa.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Good man.
Winky is in charge of our space department.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Ah.
SANTA CLAUS (ON
TV): Oh, now here, here is the latest toy rocket.
It runs on real rocket fuel.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Really?
I've been wondering, what is this strange little creature over here?
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Oh, uh, Winky made that.
That's his idea of a Martian.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): A Martian?
Wow-ee-wow, I'd hate to meet a creature like that on a dark night.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Oh-ho-ho.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): I wonder if there really are people on Mars.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Well, who knows.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): Well, if there are, I hope they have someone like you up there, Santa, to bring joy and good cheer to all the Martian children.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Oh,
Mr. Anders... Ho-ho-ho.
Well, keep going, Winky.
Christmas Eve is coming soon.
Now Mr. Anderson, I want to show you some more things.
Now you...
Dropo?
Dropo, you lazy, good-for-nothing, where are you?
Dropo, Dropo, wake up.
Wake up.
[LAUGHING]
Oh, please turn off that tickle ray.
KIMAR: Stand up.
Stand up.
Stand up.
Stand up.
I'm sorry, Ki... Kimar, sir.
Dropo, you are the laziest man on Mars.
Why are you sleeping during working hours?
I wasn't sleeping, Chief.
It's just that I haven't been able to sleep these last few nights.
I forgot how.
So I was just practicing.
Well I suggest you practice doing your work.
Where's Lady Momar?
Oh, she went to the food pill center to get some new food pills.
The children haven't been eating well.
No appetite at all.
Oh, it's no wonder.
They sit in front of the video set all day, watching those ridiculous
Earth programs.
It confuses them.
Where are they?
Oh, in there watching
Earth programs.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Say,
Santa, what have we here?
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
These are new dolls.
Now, this little doll walks, talks, cries, and she even sings.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Almost like a real, live little girl.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): That she is sir, that she is.
All she needs is tender loving care.
Bomar, what is a doll?
I don't know, Girmar.
What is tender loving care?
I don't know, either.
Bomar, Girmar, I told you not to watch those silly Earth programs.
Now go to sleep.
Must we go to sleep now, Father?
I want to see Santa
Claus some more.
I want to see more toys.
No.
Go to sleep.
Hello, Dropo.
I see you're keeping busy.
Oh, I've been working very hard, Lady Momar.
I've been vacuuming the room.
Good.
Is the master here?
Oh, he's in there.
And Kimar is very angry, too.
Kimar, I bought some new food pills.
I hope the children will eat these.
We have hamburger, buttered asparagus, mashed potatoes, and a special treat for them, chocolate layer cake pills.
Momar, I'm worried about our children.
So am I. They've hardly eaten a thing in three days.
It goes deeper than that.
They're behaving strangely.
They appear to be troubled.
They don't care to sleep.
I had to use the sleep spray on them again.
I mentioned this to my council chiefs today, and I learned it's the same with children all around the planet, in every district.
Something is happening to the children of Mars.
Kimar, as the leader of the Martians, you must do something about it.
I know, but what?
Why don't you go to the forest and see
Chochem, the ancient one.
He'll know what to do.
He's never failed you.
You speak wisely.
I will go.
Attention, council chiefs.
Please report.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Lomas reporting.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Rigna reporting.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Hargo here.
Voldar?
Voldar, please report.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Voldar reporting.
Gentlemen of the council, we will meet immediately at Chochum's Chair in Thunder Forest.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON INTERCOM):
What's wrong now, Kimar?
I don't know, Voldar.
But I mean to find out.
Where's Kimar?
He should be here any moment.
What's this all about?
We'll find out when Kimar arrives.
We are probably going to seek the advice of Chochum.
What does Kimar think we are, a kindergarten class?
Can't we make our own decisions?
Must we always come crawling to that [INAUDIBLE] old man?
Chochum is 800 years old.
You can't dismiss the wisdom of centuries.
I can.
Gentlemen.
Thank you for coming.
Chochum?
Chochum, are you here?
Ancient One of Mars,
I call upon you.
Chochum, it is I, Kimar, and the council chiefs.
We need you, Chochum.
You called me, Kimar?
We need your advice, Chochum.
Something is wrong with our children.
They eat not.
They sleep not.
Their only interest is watching meaningless Earth programs on the video.
Wh-wh-what time of year is it now?
KIMAR: It is the middle of Septober.
No, no.
Not here.
I mean on Earth.
Ah, yes.
It is early December on Earth.
Close to the time of the Christmas.
That explains it.
What is a Christmas?
It is an occasion for great joy and peace on the planet Earth.
And for children, it is also a time of anticipation, as they await the arrival of
Santa Claus and his gifts.
Bah, what nonsense.
What has this to do with our children, Ancient One?
We have no children on Mars.
They have children's bodies, but with adult minds.
They do not have a childhood.
I've seen this coming for centuries.
They are born.
Our electronic teaching machines are attached to their brains while they are in their cradles.
Information is fed into their minds in a constant stream.
And by the time they can walk, they are adults.
They've never played.
They've never learned to have fun.
And now, now they are rebelling.
What do you advise?
The children must be allowed to be children again.
They must learn to play.
They must learn what it means to have fun.
We need a Santa Claus on Mars.
Santa Claus on Mars?
Where will we get a Santa Claus?
There's only one Santa
Claus, and he's on Earth.
Well, I guess that takes care of that.
Didn't I tell you it was a foolish idea to seek advice from that old man?
This is a serious matter, Voldar.
And desperate problems require desperate deeds.
Earth has had Santa
Claus long enough.
We will bring him to Mars.
I'm against it.
Our children are fine the way they are.
I don't want any Santa Claus bringing them toys and games.
They'll start playing and laughing and running under foot.
They'll become a nuisance.
I've made my decision.
We leave for Earth tonight.
Rigna, Lomas, prepare spaceship number one.
Approaching projected Earth orbit.
Fire port side rockets number one and number two.
Port side rockets number one and number two, fired.
Entering Earth orbit.
All right, Voldar.
Now to find Santa Claus.
Turn on your magnascope to third power.
We're over a city of some kind.
So that's what the Earth people call a city, eh?
How primitive.
Look at all those buildings above ground.
Why, we could destroy that city with one blast of our Q-ray.
We've not come here to destroy anyone.
Our only purpose is to bring
Santa Claus back to Mars.
Turn to fifth power.
Let's see if we can locate Santa Claus.
He wears a red suit, trimmed with white fur, and he has a long white beard.
But there are millions of people down there.
It's like looking for a speck of space dust in a comet's tail.
Wait a minute.
I see him.
I see Santa Claus.
I see him, too.
He's standing on the corner, ringing a bell.
No he's not.
He's standing near the entrance of a large building, next to a large black kettle.
He's standing on the corner, Kimar.
He's... wait a minute.
I see another one.
Why, there are hundreds of
Santa Clauses down there.
Are we going to bring them all back with us to Mars?
Just one.
And with so many, they won't miss one.
Prepare for landing on next orbit.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON
TV): We interrupt our program with a special bulletin.
An unidentified object has been spotted in orbit around the Earth.
The Soviet Union denies it has launched any new space satellites.
Our radar stations are tracking the spaceship, or whatever it is.
The US Air Force has alerted all defense commands and retaliatory units.
Sir, Earth radar beams are bouncing off our ship.
Well, it certainly took them long enough.
Voldar, turn on the radar shield.
Dysfunctioning of radar shield.
Rigna, check the radar box.
Radar shield functioning.
What was wrong, Rigna?
A slight case of Dropo.
Oh, hi Chief.
What are you doing here, Dropo?
Oh, well, Chief, I went to the launching pad so I could say goodbye to you, and I remembered,
I've never been to Earth!
So I thought I wanted to see...
I may leave you there in place of Santa Claus.
Now get below.
I'll deal with you later.
Dropo, get below quickly.
Yes chief.
Yes.
Yes chief.
I'm sorry.
Prepare to land.
We'll set down in that field near the lake.
Rocket silencers set.
Rotor rockets number one and two, fire.
All this trouble over a fat little man in a red suit.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): Here is another UFO bulletin.
The Defense Department has just announced that the unidentified flying object has suddenly disappeared from our radar screen.
They believe the object has either disintegrated in space, or it may be a spaceship from some other planet, which has the ability to nullify our radar beams.
Because of the ominous situation, the president has ordered the Strategic
Air Command into action.
[HORN BUZZING]
NEWS ANCHOR (VOICEOVER):
The Defense Department believes that the object spotted on our radar screens might have been nothing more than a meteor which burned up when it entered our atmosphere.
Professor [INAUDIBLE] Von
Green, our leading space expert, is still convinced it was a Martian spaceship.
Stay tuned for further bulletins.
Billy, what does a
Martian look like?
I don't know.
Nobody's ever seen one.
I don't believe there are any Martians.
You don't, huh?
What would you do if a Martian walked right up behind you?
I'd scream.
[SCREAMS]
Ah, stop doing that.
I'm trying to sleep.
I see a Martian.
Boy, you and your imagination.
Come on, let's go home.
Who... who are you?
We're from Mars.
Don't be afraid.
We have children just like you on Mars.
What are those funny things sticking out of your head.
Those are our antenna.
Are you a television set?
Shh.
Stupid question.
Is this what you want to do to our children on Mars?
Turn them into nincompoops like these?
Hold your tongue, Voldar?
What's your name, little boy?
Billy.
Billy Foster, sir.
And this is my sister, Betty.
Well perhaps you can help us, Billy.
We're looking for one of your Santa Clauses.
There's only one Santa Claus.
We've seen many of them in your cities.
Oh.
Those are his helpers.
There's only one real Santa Claus.
And he's in his workshop up at the North Pole.
That's what we came here to find out.
Let's go.
Come on, you two.
Let me go!
Where are you taking us?
Leave them alone, Voldar!
What?
And leave them here to inform the authorities?
He's right, Kimar.
We'd better take them along with us to North Pole.
Very well.
Come along.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): This morning, two children disappeared mysteriously in the vicinity of Welsh Lake.
The police have found no clues.
And it seems as though
Billy and Betty Foster have simply vanished into thin air.
This appears to be a day when everything is vanishing into thin air.
While local police are continuing their search for the missing children, the armed forces are continuing their search for the mysterious object from space.
All right, Billy and Betty.
Nobody here.
Come on in.
Golly.
Now, I'm not supposed to bring you here.
The chief's going to be awful mad if he finds us.
Boy, wait 'til the kids at home find that I was in a real
Martian spaceship.
No... no, don't touch anything.
Now, here.
That's the anti-gravity generator.
And these are the retro rockets.
Does this light up?
Only when radar waves are bouncing off our ship.
Then we put up this radar screen.
Then nobody can find us in space.
Boy, that's pretty sharp.
Yep.
What's this, Dropo?
Oh, that's the elevator signal.
That light starts flashing when somebody's coming up from the navigation deck.
Oh... oh, oh.
BILLY: Somebody's coming up.
We better get out of here.
No, no, no!
There's no time for that.
Oh, oh, I'm in trouble.
Oh, no time.
Here.
Here, here.
Quick.
Thinking of taking another nap in the radar box, Dropo?
Oh, oh, no sir.
As a matter of fact, I was just looking in there to remind myself never to hide in there again.
I bet.
No.
Approaching North Pole.
I can see Santa Claus' workshop.
Prepare for landing.
Hargo, set the rocket silences.
Dropo?
You stay aboard and guard those children.
They must not leave the ship now.
Now, or never?
What do you mean, Voldar?
If we take them with us to Mars,
Santa's disappearance would remain a mystery.
No one on Earth will ever know that Santa
Claus was kidnapped by Martians.
Perhaps you're right.
Dropo?
Yes sir?
Get back to those children, and don't let them out of your sight.
Understand?
Yes, sir I understand.
I... I'll keep an eye.
We've landed.
Secure the ship.
Lomas, you remain on guard and have the ship ready for immediate blast off.
Rigna, Hargo, Voldar, you'll accompany me.
Come.
We'll activate Torg.
Torg?
To capture a roly poly little man like Santa Claus?
We don't need Torg.
We won't take any chances.
Come.
Nothing can stop Torg.
They're going to kidnap
Santa Claus, and us, too.
Not if we can help it.
We've got to get out of here and warn Santa.
What's a Torg?
I don't know, but
I'm not afraid of it.
It's not going to stop us.
Come on.
Wait, Betty.
BETTY: Why did you do that?
If this ship ever leaves Earth, we'll have the whole US
Space Force after them.
Come on.
Wait a minute.
Come on.
BILLY: Come on, Betty.
This action must take place swiftly.
We can't afford to make any mistakes.
Hargo, you cover the rear of the workshop.
Rigna, Voldar, cover the front entrance.
I'll direct Torg.
Voldar isn't here.
Rigna, go up and tell Voldar... Voldar, this is another one of your delaying tactics.
You've been opposing me at every turn.
Now I'm warning you, change your attitude.
You finished, Chief?
Yes I am.
And you will be, too, if you're not careful.
Oh, but I am carefully, Chief.
So careful that I looked in at the children before I left the ship.
You stay away from those children.
That will be easy to do.
They've escaped.
Voldar, if this is your idea of a joke...
Ask Dropo.
They overheard our plans.
At this very moment, they're on their way to Santa Claus to warn him.
It's true, Kimar.
Their footprints.
We must stop them.
Those children mustn't reach Santa Claus.
Follow them.
I'll put Torg on the trail.
Torg, come out of the spaceship.
Torg.
Come out of the spaceship.
Billy, I can't run anymore.
I'm cold.
And I'm tired.
And it's beginning to snow.
Please, Betty.
Try.
We've got to warn Santa.
We can't stop now.
They might catch us.
Where is Santa?
BILLY: I don't know.
His workshop must be somewhere around here.
Betty, look.
It's Voldar.
BETTY: He's the mean one, the one who doesn't like us.
Come on.
Get back.
Don't move, Betty.
I'll go take a look.
It's all right now, Betty.
Come on.
I'm cold.
I wish it wouldn't snow.
That's the best thing that could happen.
It'll cover our tracks and be harder for the Martians to find us.
And it'll be harder for us to find Santa's workshop.
I'm scared.
We'll find it.
Which way is north?
I see it!
I see it!
Santa's workshop.
BILLY: Where?
Right there.
See the light?
Where?
The lights are moving.
They're coming towards us.
Betty, that's not Santa's house.
Wha... What is it?
BILLY: I don't know.
Good work, Torg.
Now destroy them.
Crush them.
Crush them, Torg.
Do as I say.
Voldar, I knew you'd try something like this.
I set Torg's controls so he will obey only me.
Release them, Torg.
You were very lucky.
Now don't try to escape again.
You may not be so lucky next time.
Hargo, take them back to ship, lock them up, and rejoin us.
You won't get away with this, you... you Martian!
The danger grows with every minute.
Let's get Santa
Claus and blast off.
We'll surround the workshop and send Torg in to get Santa.
Nobody is to be harmed unless they get in our way.
Right.
No one is to be harmed.
What has happened to the great warriors of our planet?
Mars used to be the planet of war.
Mark my words, Kimar, your softness will destroy us.
Santa Claus, toys, games, laughing children.
Well we shall see.
But for now, to your posts.
Torg, follow me.
Get him, Torg.
You can't come in here.
No one's allowed.
Well, where did you come from?
You're the biggest toy I've ever seen.
[LAUGHING]
And very well, made too.
By the great dog star, Santa's treating him like a toy.
Get him, Torg.
Grab him.
He's become a toy.
Rigna, we'll have to get Santa ourselves.
Come on, Voldar.
What have we here?
More toys?
Those are Martians.
Santa Claus, you're coming with us.
No.
You can't take him now.
It's too near Christmas.
Quiet, you.
But...
We don't want to hurt you, Santa Claus, so come along quietly.
Why... why did you have to do that to my helper?
It's harmless.
It'll wear off in a short while.
Oh.
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?
Now you come with us.
We need you on Mars.
Are you sure this is harmless?
Oh, I never saw such lazy people, standing around like statues.
There's work to be done.
Let's get to it.
Oh me, oh my, oh me, oh... oh, Mrs. Claus is going to be very angry about this.
Take him, Torg.
Torg, take him.
Obey my command.
Forget it, Kimar.
Rigna was right.
He's nothing but a toy now.
Best to leave him here.
Believe me, I had nothing whatsoever to do about this.
You know my dear, I can't recall a time when you were so silent for so long.
Let's go, old man.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): And Mrs.
Santa Claus has positively identified the kidnappers as Martians.
Never in the history of mankind have the nations of the world reacted with such unanimity and cooperation.
Tonight the lights will burn until dawn in the United
Nations building as the leaders of the world a map of course of action.
And at Cape Kennedy, our correspondent interviewed
[INAUDIBLE] Von Green, the man in charge of
America's Starshot program.
CORRESPONDENT (VOICEOVER):
Mr. Von Green, what is the space agency doing about this?
VON GREEN (ON TV): Well, they have mobilized all the men and equipment in our
Starshot project.
And we have rushed our astronauts into an intensive program for the final phase of their training.
Now, our Starshot ship is supposed undergo six months of test flights.
But we are going to forget about the testing and go after those
Martian monkeys.
CORRESPONDENT (VOICEOVER):
Isn't that risky?
VON GREEN (ON TV): Of course it is risky.
But every one of our astronauts is begging for the chance to go after the Martians.
Who wouldn't give everything to bring
Santa back to our children?
Earth hasn't reacted yet.
No radar beams being bounced off our ship.
Looks like we made a clean getaway.
[LAUGHING]
How's our captive?
He's having the time of his life.
He's such a funny little man.
Why, I've only been with him for five minutes, and he has me laughing just like an Earthling.
What's soft, and round, and you put it on a stick, and... and you toast it in a fire, and it's green?
I don't know, what?
A Martian-mallow.
That's what you're all becoming... Martian-mallows.
Soft.
Weak.
That old man is a menace.
Gee, Santa, it's all our fault.
We told them where to find you.
Oh, balderdash and a fiddle-dee-dee, Billy boy.
Everybody knows where Santa lives.
Besides, I've always wanted to visit Mars.
Mommy and Daddy are going to be angry.
You think that's something?
I can just see Mrs. Claus now.
Christmas coming, and I'm not there.
She'll have a fit.
Oh me oh my oh me.
Come and get it.
Dinner time.
Here's Dropo.
If I can't cheer you up, Dropo can.
He always makes me laugh.
Oh, you'll have a wonderful dinner tonight.
Oh, there's soup, and beef stew, and chocolate ice cream.
No thank you, Dropo.
I'm not hungry.
Come on, Billy.
Oh.
Well, is it all right if I have your chocolate ice cream?
Sure.
Oh, I just love chocolate ice cream.
Kimar, look at this.
That small blip is not an asteroid.
It's a spaceship, and it's on our tail, getting closer.
Impossible, Rigna.
They couldn't have spotted us.
We have our radar shield on.
I know that sir, but they are gaining on us.
Is it possible Earth has a secret device that can penetrate our radar shield?
They have a secret device, and his name is Billy Foster.
I warned you that these
Earthlings are dangerous.
They'll destroy us if we allow them.
Well I won't allow them.
I think we underestimate the resourcefulness of these Earth people.
Very clever of the boy.
Make the repairs, Rigna.
I'll take evasive action.
Well.
And how is Santa, and the little Earthlings.
My, it must be tiresome cooped up in this little room.
Say, how would you like to see the rest of the ship?
You're not fooling me.
You don't like us.
You're mean.
Oh, come on now.
That's not true.
Why, Santa makes everyone feel good, even me.
I don't trust you.
Now, now, Billy boy.
That's not the Christmas spirit.
Why, of course, Voldar.
We'd love to take the grand tour.
All right, children.
This room is called...
Airlock.
That's right.
Sure.
This is where you come when you're ready to go out in space.
It's airtight.
You put on your space suit, and go out through that door.
When you come back, the door closes, and they pump air back into the room through there.
When it reaches the pressure of the rest of the ship, you can take your space suit off.
Smart lad.
Well, where's the control that opens the door [INAUDIBLE]?
Not here.
That's in the control deck.
You see, once you pull that switch, the warning bell sounds, and in 60 seconds, that door opens.
Santa, that clock stopped.
60 seconds.
That must be the door timer.
Santa, he locked us in.
Oh, I don't think so.
He probably just stepped out for a moment.
It's locked.
I don't trust Voldar.
He's not like Kimar and the others.
I don't like him.
I'm worried, Santa.
Now, now, children, let's not get excited.
It's Voldar.
He's going to open the space door.
Help, Kimar!
Kimar!
Help!
Gee, Santa, what are we going to do?
Once that door opens, we haven't got a chance.
Eh.
Where'd you say this leads to, Billy?
VOLDAR: Seven six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.
Who's in the airlock?
No one, now.
What's going on, Voldar?
Oh, Chief, Santa and the children are missing.
Where are they?
Drifting around in space, along with the rest of the space junk.
Before I'm through with you, Voldar, you'll wish you were floating around out there in space.
[LAUGHING]
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Santa Claus, you're all right.
I... I thought you were...
Well, when Voldar accidentally left in the airlock, and then came up here and accidentally threw the door switch, we knew we had to get out of there in a hurry, or that would be the end of us...
Eh, accidentally, of course.
So we crawled up through the air duct.
The air duct.
But the air duct is just a little, and... and you're so big.
[LAUGHING]
Well, you're talking to Santa Claus, son.
KIMAR: But, how...
Well, well now, you wouldn't want me to tell my secret, would you?
[LAUGHING]
Oh... oh, oh, poor man.
He's fainted, just like someone who's seen a ghost.
KIMAR: Begin landing operation.
CREW: (SINGING) Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.
Uh, Merry Christmas, Voldar.
[MUFFLED SQUEAKING]
All right, on your feet, come on.
Dropo!
Oh, whoa... I was handing him food pills through the bars, and he grabbed my wrists...
Shut up, Dropo.
Kimar, come in quickly.
Kimar?
Yes, Rigna?
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
Voldar has escaped.
What?
He's gone.
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM): That can only mean trouble.
Put a constant guard on
Santa and the Earth children.
Voldar will be back.
Oh, Kimar.
Are you alone?
No.
MOMAR: Well.
KIMAR: Earthlings...
Billy and Betty.
Welcome to our home.
There's someone else, too.
Oh?
Come on.
Come on in.
Lady Momar.
I'm not accustomed to entering people's homes through the door, but you have no chimney.
Welcome, Santa Claus.
We hope you'll make the children on Mars very happy.
I'll try, dear lady.
I'll try.
Where are they?
KIMAR: Well, we'll start with my youngsters.
How are they, Momar?
MOMAR: The same.
Quiet, remote, and very unhappy.
They're inside, studying.
Well, let old Santa say hello to them.
And I'm sure these children would like to meet them.
I'll tell them you're here.
COMPUTER: Y over 5 pi r squared to determine the correct orbit from Mars to Jupiter, traveling along Vector
A through the 17th quadrant at the power of 12 megatrons.
Father!
Father, we missed you.
I missed you, too.
Children, I brought some visitors from Earth.
Will you come in please, children?
Billy and Betty, this is Bomar and Girmar.
Hi.
There's nothing in it.
What are you giving me?
My hand, to shake.
How old are you?
I'm 10, too.
And Girmar's eight.
So is my sister.
We have another Earth person that wants to see you.
What's that?
They're laughing.
Bomar and Girmar, too.
They've never laughed before.
Come.
I can't believe it.
That's the first time in months they've gone to sleep without the sleep spray.
Santa, tomorrow we'll set up a workshop for you.
It won't be exactly the same as the one you have on Earth, but I'm sure it'll serve your purpose.
Good, good.
Now, I'd like to get going and have the toy shop operating full blast, so as I can return to Earth for Christmas.
You know, Mrs. Claus is a very good-natured woman, but...
Santa Claus, you will never return to Earth.
Wha...
Now you belong to Mars.
Ho, ho, ho.
Well, we've no time to lose.
We must go into action.
Now we cannot eliminate Santa Claus, but we can just discredit him, make him a laughingstock throughout Mars.
Come on.
Now listen, carefully.
That workshop closes at 10 o'clock.
The guards will be at Kimar's house, guarding Santa Claus.
Now this is what we'll do, see?
You take...
Two dolls.
Two dolls.
Yes, Betty.
BETTY: Three baseball bats.
Three baseball bats.
Look at me, Santa Claus, the great toymaker, pressing buttons.
That's automation for you.
Technology, oi.
Well, that's enough for today.
Let's close up shop!
OK, Santa.
OK, Santa.
Boy, we sure did a lot today.
SANTA CLAUS: Yes, well, there's another day gone, children.
As they say on Earth, another day, another dollar.
Well, hello, Santa.
How are you feeling today?
Tired?
No, no.
I'm not tired.
But my finger is.
It's been pressing buttons all day long.
Well, I think I'll go in and put my finger to bed.
Here, children.
Here's your milk.
You can play for half an hour, and then you'll have to go to bed.
Daddy, may we watch the Earth program?
Certainly, dear.
But only for half an hour.
Billy?
Betty?
Don't you want to watch the Earth programs?
Oh, no sir.
We're not interested in Earth programs.
I'm going to sleep.
Goodnight.
Me, too.
Just a moment.
Goodnight, Mr. Kimar.
Goodnight, Lady Momar.
Just a moment, children.
Are you feeling well?
Oh, we feel fine, sir.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
KIMAR: Has someone been mistreating you?
Oh, no sir.
You and Lady Momar have just been swell to us.
Goodnight.
What could it be, Momar?
They're behaving the way our children used to behave.
Can't you tell, Kimar?
They're homesick.
They miss their parents, their friends.
Kimar, you've got to send those children back.
Impossible.
Oh, now I'm Santa Claus.
Ho, ho, ho.
Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas everyone!
Ho, ho, ho.
My finger isn't tired.
I think I'll go down to the workshop and make some more toys.
Ho, ho, ho. (SINGING)
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
[HUMMING]
VOLDAR: Shim, pull the light.
No, the light.
Oh, ah, this is going shake 'em up.
These toys will never be the same again.
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Someone's coming.
Quick, down.
(SINGING) Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride the one horse open sleigh, hey.
What a break.
It's Santa Claus.
He's alone.
No guards.
(SINGING) Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride... oh, oh, oh.
Now stay put, my fat little friend.
Hey, Santa.
How do you like this toy?
Ho, ho, ho.
My friend asked you a question.
Answer him.
Ho, ho, ho.
Quiet, Shim.
Put on a nuclear curtain.
Tomorrow marks the end of Operation Santa Claus.
And Mars returns to normal.
Dropo, we're here.
He's hiding, Santa.
Oh, playing hide and seek, eh?
All right, Dropo.
Here we come, ready or not.
He's not here, Santa.
That's funny.
Oh, well, he'll turn up.
Let's get started.
Hey, ho!
Ready?
OK.
Let's go.
One teddy bear and one doll.
One teddy bear and one doll.
Santa, stop the machine!
Look!
The doll has a teddy bear's head, and the teddy bear has a doll's head.
I can't understand it.
Oh, let's try it again.
What's next, Betty?
One baseball bat.
SANTA CLAUS: A baseball tennis...
Why, this will never do.
The machine isn't working right.
Oh, dear.
What else, Betty?
A toy train.
A toy train.
Well, all right.
Yes.
Look at that.
Wha... Why, this doesn't make sense.
Well, this never happened when we made toys by hand.
Something very strange is happening here.
Bomar, I think you'd better call your father.
Father?
Father, this is Bomar.
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM): Yes, Bomar?
Father, we're in the toy shop.
Dropo was in here, and there's something wrong with the toy machine, too.
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM):
I'll be right over.
Just a word of warning.
If you got any big ideas, forget them.
If you walk through that nuclear curtain, you'll be disintegrated like that.
Sabotage Somebody switched all our wiring.
Dropo's gone.
Your suit is missing.
And now, this machine's been sabotaged.
Put them all together, it spells Voldar.
He was here, and he thought Dropo was me.
He's got Dropo.
And I've got to find him.
Poor Dropo.
Surprised to see us?
You're under arrest, Voldar.
Stop playing with toys.
Put it away, Kimar.
We have a weapon that's much more potent than that.
As you may know, we are holding Santa Claus a hostage.
One false move, and your little ho, ho, ho man will be destroyed.
All right.
What do you want, Voldar?
These are our terms.
First, destroy the toy machine.
Second, we will release Santa Claus if you promise to send him and the Earthlings back to their planet.
Third, no more joy through toys nonsense on Mars.
Well?
Well, you win.
Are you sure you have Santa Claus?
VOLDAR: You know we have him.
You mean you had him.
How did he get out of the cave?
Shim, that idiot!
A-a-and how'd he get here s-s-so fast?
Santa Claus has powers that you don't know about.
All right.
Arms up.
Rigna, Hargo, Lomas, report.
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
This is Rigna, Kimar.
Hargo and Lomas are with me.
Good.
I've got Voldar and Stobo.
I'll keep them here in the storeroom of the toy shop.
Rigna, you come here and take them off my hands.
I want Hargo and Lomas to look for a man named Shim.
Tell them to search the caves along the Transverse Canal.
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
Right, Kimar.
All right, you two.
In there.
All right, you might as well relax.
You're going to be here for a while.
Sit down.
SHIM: Where are you going?
Ho, ho, ho.
Can't you say anything else but ho, ho, ho?
DROPO: Ho, ho, ho.
If you're thinking of leaving,
Santa, let me remind you.
Once you hit that nuclear curtain, there won't even be a whisker left.
Ho, ho, ho.
SHIM: Hey, Santa!
Be careful!
What are you going to do with us?
You're going to stand trial before the council.
I don't think you'll be causing any more trouble.
Well now, I think that should do it, Billy boy.
Close the door, son.
Now, I think we need a little red paint.
And you'll find it in the storeroom.
Sure, Santa.
Yes.
That's a good boy.
VOLDAR: This time I'll take care of Santa Claus for good, and smash that machine.
Santa!
Santa!
Voldar and the other man are in the storeroom, and they're coming to get you.
Oh, they are, are they?
Yeh... well, maybe they'd like to have some fun with our toys, and we'll see that they do.
Won't we kids.
Oh-ho, we meet again, eh?
I don't know how you escaped
Shim, but you won't escape me.
You're through.
Voldar, why don't you, uh, relax?
You're going to relax... permanently.
You?
Wha... but, you're not here.
You're in there.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
I'm not here.
I'm in there.
Wait a minute.
I'm going to see who
Voldar's fighting in there.
What happened?
I don't know what's going on in there, but I'm going to take care of you myself.
Now... now, just a minute.
Now I'd like to talk to... Oh, boy,
Chief, am I glad to see you.
All right, inside, Stobo.
All right, kids, you can stop now.
I said cease fire.
All right, Rigna.
Take them away.
They've had a rough day.
Ho, ho, ho, everybody.
Merry Christmas!
You don't need me here, Kimar.
You've got a wonderful
Santa Claus of your own.
Ho, ho, ho!
Goodbye, Billy.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Betty dear.
You take care of yourself.
Bye.
I've got something for you, Billy.
Gee, thanks.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Gee, we had fun.
We're going to miss you.
Do you think we'll ever meet again?
I'm sure you will, children.
Thank you, Santa, for bringing happiness to the children of Mars.
And the Christmas spirit to all of us.
Son, from the bottom of my heart,
I wish you and yours the very best of everything.
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas, everybody!
Dropo Claus is here.
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!
Dropo, you put on weight.
Oh, yes.
No pillows, look.
Look kids, no pillows.
Now, if we hurry, we can get back in time for Christmas Eve.
KIDS: Yay!
Shall we get going?
KIDS: Yay!
Goodbye, dear friends.
Away!
Merry Christmas, everyone!
Away!
MARTIANS: Bye!
Goodbye, Santa Claus!
Goodbye!

CLAUS"]
THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL
Providence Street
- Where are you going?
- I'm going for a stroll
Now? We have 20 guests for dinner
I forgot that, but I promise
I'll be back soon
- You are going nowhere
- Please let me go
All right, but don't bother coming back
Lucas has quit.
Has he been arguing with you?
No. He didn't tell us he was leaving
We got on well together.
He's a nice man
If he was not happy, it's a good thing he's gone
Well, there are plenty more like Lucas about
Maybe there's a woman involved
Camila, what shall we do?
Please yourself, but I simply must go out
That's how I feel, but where can we go at this hour?
And the weather's so awful
One of my friends will put us up
I'm taking a taxi, I could drop you off
You'll wait for me
The caviar?
Madam wants the main dish to be served first
- And I've got to do it
- Because you're a clown
Lucas isn't here. Your coats will be taken upstairs
- Do you hear anything?
- They've gone upstairs
We shouldn't leave like this
You should have thought of that before
Let's go
No, I've never tried it
Our youngest colonel, yet you have no taste for heroism?
I dread the noise of guns, Blanca
What of your countrt?
It's a network of rivers flowing into the sea
- The sea is death
- Death for one's countrt
Alvaro, Edmundo wishes to speak
To the wonderful evening given to us by Silvia...
...with her magnificent virgin bride of Lammermoor
Bride, perhaps... but virgin?
- A title more appropriate to "Valkyrie"
- "Valkyrie"?
My name for Leticia.
She's ferocious and a virgin
Are you sure she's virgin?
They say she preserves it - a perversion, perhaps
To the wonderful evening given to us by Silvia...
...with her magnificent virgin bride of Lammermoor
I've taken the liberty of varting the menu
The hors-d'oeuvre will be a Maltese dish, which is good for the appetite
It's made of liver, honey, almonds and a piquant sauce
Delicious! I had it when
I conducted in Capri
Right on cue, just as in the theatre
Wonderful, Lucia!
That was really unexpected!
Lucia has a flair for such chic surprises!
I'm not in the least bit amused
I'm just in time.
Don't let him loose
Mr Russell doesn't like jokes, put him in the garden
I think madam is wise.
There are other problems, too
- What's wrong?
- Odd things are happening
If madam will come with me...
- And the sheep, madam?
- Put them in the garden, too
- Where are you going?
- Madam...
Are you leaving, too, Pablo?
I must see my poor sister, madam
Why? Is she ill?
She felt unwell this morning
Ridiculous! This is an insult to my guests
Everything is ready to be served, madam
God, give me patience!
Have you been unhappy here?
On the contrart, a vert happy five years, madam
- So?
- Forgive me
- And where are you going?
- I'm going with Pablo
- We'll be back in the morning
- Consider yourselves dismissed
I would like to be of service to madam
Please forgive us.
Excuse me
No doubt they planned this.
Why?
Servants become more impertinent evert day
Continue serving with the footmen.
I'm relying on you
- What about our things?
- We'll come back for them tomorrow
They won't let us in.
I'm taking my suitcase now
A passing Jew
No, it was "Valkyrie"
A fascinating woman
- What is your name?
- Beatriz. And yours?
Eduardo
- Age?
- Thirty
- Profession?
- Architect
- Single?
- Until Saturday, like you
Five more days
I ate with real appetite tonight, doctor
Your treatment has transformed me
Not at all.
Your ailments are not serious
- Do you dance?
- I've never tried
A pity. I would love to be in your arms
I'm flattered that my patient is so pleased with me
- Transference
- I've long wanted to satisfy that desire
Did you bring your pills?
- What's the matter?
- It's nothing, doctor
With your ulcer you shouldn't eat so much
May I present an old friend of mine?
- It's a pleasure to meet you
- Likewise
- Will you excuse me?
- Of course
- Blanca is playing for us
- We'll be back in a minute
Why did she kiss you so passionately?
Poor Leonora, how is her cancer?
Any hope?
None. I give her three months to total baldness
A good skull
- Leandro!
- My dear Cristián
It's so nice to see you.
I thought you were still in New York
- I turn up like a bad penny
- We must get together
We must arrange one of our special entertainments
Careful, we're not alone
May I present Mr Russell?
Don't bother.
Continue to present each other
Besides, it's all Greek to me.
Excuse me
- That Russell is eccentric
- He must be a man of letters. Too bad!
Shall we go and listen to Blanca?
Bravo! Well done!
- Magnificent!
- An exquisite performance
How superb it would be with a harpsichord
Now something by Scarlatti, I beg you
Excuse me, but it's late and I'm tired
But it's the most intimate, agreeable moment of our evening
- You've been wonderful, Blanca
- Was it Paradisi?
Exquisite!
So, the great conductor is one of us
I'm happy to make your acquaintance... so fraternally
- Which lodge?
- Dawn Twenty-one
Sublime column
Maestro, what do you think of the pizzicato we've just heard?
Sonata, sir, sonata
May I introduce you? Señor Ugalde, this is...
- Leandro Gómez
- Nice to meet you
- Will you stay long?
- Will you?
- You first
- No, you
- I live here
- Just as I thought
- Time for the coats
- Yes, sir
Please excuse him. He felt rejuvenated this evening
He drank a little, and he's tired
One cannot but admire his stamina on the rostrum
How can he sustain such demanding activity?
Well, after the concert he even tried to...
I've nothing to complain about.
I even have to restrain him
Let him sleep. He may trt again here!
My goodness, I don't think he would do that here
Of course not.
I expressed myself badly
She's a little tired. It's only natural in her condition
Congratulations. Drowsiness is a good sign
- Your fourth child?
- I've lost count
- Are you sure you're the father?
- You'd better ask her
Science will decide
I thought you'd gone
RaÚl is telling us about the fauna of Romania
The climate, you see...
I really must go now.
Where is my shawl?
Just a second
They won't go. It's nearly four
They'll go soon. Then you can slip up to my room
Your husband?
If he finds you, I'll say I wanted to show you my incunabula
Good idea
Thank you so much
It went well, in spite of...
It's late, and your lipstick is fading
We must look after our friends.
They are feeling cooped-up
I enjoy the spontaneity of this situation
If you care to spend the night here...
...we will have rooms prepared for you
I'm glad to see that the spirit of improvisation still survives
You are the perfect host, but we must not abuse your hospitality
I have a rehearsal tomorrow
And I have an appointment... in only four hours time
Now they're turning out the lights
We must make a decision.
We must leave
If the others are drunk or mad they can stay
This is outrageous!
If I weren't a guest here...
...I'd teach that lout a lesson
These clothes may suit statues, but not men at 5am
Isn't that going a bit too far?
Don't forget that he's lived in the United States
It's warm, and the body is most exhausted at this hour
They will be ashamed when they recall their conduct
Certainly, and I wish to spare them embarrassment
Let us go to their level, to mitigate their conduct a little
Please, Lucia, sit here
Our first night together
But why are we here?
Why haven't we left?
Because evertone decided to stay
Is that normal?
Life is amusing... and strange
I can hardly keep awake
Come... Let's sleep
- Did you sleep well?
- I didn't wake once
For me it was worse than the Nice Express derailment
You were in a derailment?
Fascinating!
You should see yourself!
I'm bewildered. What's going on?
How could this happen to us?
It's a bit much
We must offer them breakfast, then they'll go home
I hope so. I'm relying on their discretion
I was quite shocked
A third-class carriage was squashed like a concertina
And inside, what carnage!
The sight didn't upset me.
I must be insensitive
I'm hungrt
Yet you fainted at the bier of Prince Lourcat
No comparison!
How could one be insensitive to his grandeur in death?
He had such a noble profile
Don't they eat breakfast here?
I think the lower orders are insensitive to suffering
Have you ever seen a wounded bull?
It's impassive
I'm going to tidy myself. We look horrible, but it's amusing
Did you sleep well?
I must look awful. Why stare at me, dear sister?
You are more interesting than ever - unkemptness becomes you
I must look awful.
Why are you staring at me?
You are more interesting than ever - unkemptness becomes you
What sharp ears!
After a bad night, he lost consciousness at dawn
You should have told me.
He must be put to bed
It's better not move him. We'll do what we can for him here
- Keep him warm
- I thought he was looking odd at dinner
It may not be anything serious, it's not the first time
- How is he?
- Almost totally bald
- I don't understand
- He only has a few hours to live
And your prognoses are never wrong
- I don't feel vert well, either
- It's nothing
Julio, do your best to provide breakfast for our guests
It's vert early, the tradesmen haven't delivered yet
- Not even the milkman?
- Not even him. It's really odd
Bring the cold meat from dinner and some hot coffee
Lucia, where could we freshen up a little?
I should have attended to that earlier. Come to my room
I bet they won't go
You see? What do you make of this situation?
I don't know. It's uncommon, or perhaps only too common
No one seems to behave logically
Why didn't you and your fiancée leave?
I don't know... like evertone else... and you?
I don't know
That's what bothers me
Not one of us has made the slightest effort to go home
Why? Was it natural for us to spend the night here...
...against the elementart rules of etiquette?
Have we become a gypsy encampment?
I think it's vert original.
I love things out of the ordinart
I don't like it. But I said nothing, out of politeness
Come, gentlemen, let's not exaggerate
We were enchanted by the music, the conversation...
It's not a cause for surprise.
My feet are swollen
May I ask our charming Lucia...
...why serve breakfast here, instead of in the dining room?
Well, doctor, since we're all here
I thought...
The doctor loves to play
Sherlock Holmes, doesn't he?
My husband and children must be worried. I'm going home
We'll go with you.
This is all so absurd
- Are you coming, Rita?
- Isn't it rather early to go out?
We must see our children off to school
My children study at home with their tutor, Abbé Samson
I think he is something of a saint.
Even my husband says...
Isn't it true, Cristián?
Madam, this is no time to prattle about priests... Let's go
Excuse me
What have we got to lose by drinking coffee?
I can't smoke on an empty stomach
I'd like some, too.
Will you join us, Blanca?
This is excessive
I find this atmosphere almost hysterical
It's not the first time that
I've breakfasted at a party
Lucia, I'm afraid there are no sugar spoons
I'm sorrt, the butler has no help
- Julio, the sugar spoons
- Yes, madam
May I get you something, gentlemen?
Some coffee?
No, Julio. Just do as you were told
I think I should attend until breakfast is completed
Didn't you hear me ask you to fetch sugar spoons?
- I merely thought...
- Do as I asked
What's the matter?
Do you feel unwell?
Blanca, what's wrong? Can I help you?
What's your opinion of all this?
The butler's strange disobedience confirms my observations
No matter how we trt, we cannot leave this room
What's going on?
A man is vert ill!
- How is he, doctor?
- Bluntly, he is in a coma
If only I had some heart stimulants
Cristián, we need to make an effort and put and end to this apathy
We must get Mr Russell out of here
He urgently needs proper medical facilities
The doctor is right.
We must make an effort
Who will dare to take him?
Why don't you do it? You know we'll all follow you
It's useless
We're lost. Why did you bring me here, dear sister?
Don't be cruel. It was you who made me come here
Calm down...
There's no water
Isn't there any coffee left?
I'm dying of thirst
Madam must excuse me, but there's not a drop left
This can't be bad. A squeeze of lemon will improve the taste
Thank you, Eduardo, but I'd rather wait
I don't understand, there must be a solution
Look at me.
We haven't gone mad, have we?
Evertone's forgotten us. We've been here for 24 hours. We're lost
That's what worries me most
What's the matter?
Why don't people come...
Unless evertone's dead and we're the only survivors
- Why don't they come for us?
- Calm down
Shut up!
- I'm breaking the window
- Use the door
There's a connection between this and the servants leaving
Gentlemen, please
Let's not be alarmist. The servants must have had their reasons
Like rats when they leave a sinking ship
May I just say...
I think they left for no reason
They were all happy until shortly before you arrived
In short, there's no explanation.
It's extraordinart
We must keep calm, there's nothing worse than panic
A situation like this can't last forever
We're not spellbound, this isn't a sorcerer's castle
We will only overcome our plight by cold analysis
I propose...
...that we should all concentrate, make a supreme effort...
...be determined to get out of here, to succeed...
Shut up, Nobile.
You're responsible for all this
We're all victims of a joke that's in vert bad taste
I, my dear friend? Because
I invited you to dinner?
- Because I opened my door?
- Exactly!
You invited each of us to dine here
"Would you do me the honour... " et cetera
We'd rather have slept at home, or in a brothel. Anywhere!
Why did you extend that strange invitation?
Strange? But you were all delighted
You yourself said how happy you were
Then I correct myself. One person caused this degradation - you!
Me? You've lost your wits
Edmundo is right.
You're nothing but a fool
If you weren't a lady...
The water didn't seem to harm the butler
- I've got a headache
- No, Blanca, don't
Can't these men do anything?
They bicker like tarts
Silvia, find a way for us to get out of this hole
Don't be offended. He's more sensitive than a young girl
I'm sure this situation upsets him more than it does us
Don't make me worse!
I don't want to hear anyone.
I want to be alone
I'm content. I won't see the extermination
I wouldn't mind dying, but not among people, like this
I want the chance to be alone with you
What hope have we got to be alone?
There is a way we can isolate ourselves from the others
I don't see how
I'll tell you when they're asleep, if they ever decide to sleep
I lifted the lid and saw a precipice and a raging torrent
As I sat down an eagle flew by below me
The wind blew dead leaves in my face
I'm cold
Consumatum est
Just what we need! It would be better if we evaporated when we died
This corpse will demoralise them
Why didn't the old man die?
What's one conductor, more or less?
What shall we do?
- Were you seen?
- I don't know. I don't care
- Here it flows into the sea
- I can't reach
Keep descending
Already the horrible, fixed grin
My love
My death.
Oh, my enclosure!
Still nothing
- What do you suggest?
- This can't go on forever
Three days ago the mayor tried to establish contact
He wanted to give them instructions by loudspeaker, if any are still alive
But I made him see the absurdity of the idea
It strikes me as a good idea
But there's a simpler way. Why not enter the house? No one's done that
Yesterday we ordered a brigade of sappers to enter
At nightfall they returned to the barracks defeated
- Did they trt to enter?
- No, that's the worst of it
- Let us go in! We're not animals
- Clear off!
Why is it taking so long?
It's easy
What's wrong?
- Me first. I'm feverish
- Me, too
Wait your turn
You stepped on my foot!
Must you wear shoes?
Why is it taking so long?
Maybe the water has been cut off
You could help them
Excuse me
Move away! Women first!
Get in line. Drink only one glassful now
It will be dangerous to drink too much at first
Drink in moderation
- Women first! Didn't you hear?
- Here, drink up
I won't let you brutalise my brother!
How nice and fresh
Hungrt... I'm hungrt
Don't eat! Don't leave me alone!
He's gone two days without speaking.
He's oblivious to evertone, even me
And you say it isn't serious?
It isn't. He's suffering no more than we are
He may feel the effects more because of his age
My hands are like dead twigs
We might be better off without water
We'll only prolong our agony by drinking it
- What are you eating?
- Paper. It helps to stave off hunger
- It's nauseating
- The taste isn't disagreeable
We used to eat it at school.
The lessons bored us
My teachers were Jesuits, good people
We were bored, like most children
I know that paper is made from softwood trees
It can't harm you.
Would you care to trt it?
- Julio, come here
- Excuse me
- Put this cloth around it
- Don't go! Don't leave me alone!
Prince! Save me! Our pact!
I can't stand it anymore!
I can't bear the way that harpy combs her hair! I hate her!
Better hunger and thirst than her!
Why not comb it properly?
Like that, you see!
Comb it right through!
We are fed up with your odd habits
Sorrt to bother your, Beatriz
Have you seen a silver box containing pills?
A silver box? No, I'm sorrt
They're my husband's pills. We used to take great care of them but...
...now we're all feeling a bit...
I'll look for them
I'm hungrt
By any chance, is there a lump of sugar?
I'm sorrt, madam, but there's been nothing for two days
Are you feeling better? Someone will find the box, you'll see
Doubtless someone has it, but wants to see me suffer
Don't say that
You know, I wonder...
I wonder what they're doing.
I think of them all the time
I never forget them, either.
Our poor children
My only consolation is that the Abbé will care for them
The Abbé! I'm worried that they're at the mercy of that hypocrite
- That's unjust
- Admit he chases after you
- I won't say more
- Go on, say more!
Are you interested?
You and your marital problems mean nothing to me
You're insolent! I thought so as soon as I saw you!
I don't care. I've nothing but contempt for you
Gentlemen, we are all in the same boat
We'll all gain by treating each other considerately
- You'd better keep quiet
- That's right
It's cynical to give advice to your victims
My victims? What do you mean?
I'd be relieved to hear of some good reason...
I'm tired of explaining
Come with me, don't say anymore.
Don't make them more irritable
Sit down
Sit down with me, please
My friend, I'd give my life to remedy this situation
I am appalled by suffering. I've always tried to help the needy
How could they possibly believe that I...
Calm down
Alvaro, I'm so hungrt
Think of a way to get us out
Only a miracle can free us
Why don't we all pray together?
We have made a solemn vow
If Divine Providence frees us we will offer a Te Deum
That frightful smell. It's unbearable!
We're trting to contain it
Don't go! Don't leave me alone!
I'm so cold
I'm so cold
Blanca, remember what I told you about your hair
Doctor?
What can we do? She's suffering so much, poor thing
I can't stand it.
Why don't you kill me and end it all?
Don't be silly. You had a good night
We need analgesics as much as we need food
We haven't even an aspirin
Don't leave me, doctor
I feel better when you're near
If we ever get out of this trap
I'll go to Lourdes
- Promise that you will come with me
- I promise
We'll humble ourselves at the Virgin's feet...
...for only she can get us out of here
Don't talk so much. It won't help if you get excited
When we are at Lourdes...
...you must buy me a washable rubber Virgin
You will, won't you?
Are these yours?
We call this room
"The Paradise of Thebes"
A few friends gather here to pass unforgettable hours
Why didn't you show me before?
In these circumstances, just imagine if the others knew
What was for pleasure can now relieve pain
Laudanum, codeine and morphine
Morphine? Where?
- What is it?
- It's none of your business
What has he got hidden there?
You'll sample it when evertone is asleep
- I'm hungrt
- Silence
This is too much, show some respect
- You smell like a hyena!
- What?
Like a hyena, madam!
How dare you? Why insult me?
Shame on you for mentioning what we have the dignity to ignore
It's the truth. She stinks, like you, I, and evertone!
We live in a pigsty, like real pigs
You all disgust me. I hate you!
Take no notice, he's hypersensitive
This will end badly, my dear
What I've always hated most - coarseness, violence and filth
They're now our inseparable companions
Death is preferable to this abject promiscuity
Lord Elohim, be with me
The empire of witchcraft is assembled here
Before I die, divine Lord...
...come! come! come!
What have you done?
Have you lost your mind?
- Tie her hands up
- Take her away at once!
Call an ambulance
She's feverish. Put cold compresses on her forehead
Don't crt, it's over. They'll take turns to ensure nothing happens to you
- It's nauseating
- But it will kill the pain
- What day is it?
- What?
We've been here over a month, haven't we?
Not yet. We'd have died of hunger before now
I feel we've always been here
I feel the same way
And we'll always be here
Unless...
Unless we escape together, lose ourselves in the shadows
You don't answer
Where you go, I'll follow
- Look, it's just what we thought
- Yes
What's that?
- What's the problem now?
- Be quiet!
Who stepped on my hand?
- What's the matter?
- I may have dreamt it
I'm not blind, sir!
- What are you talking about?
- You behave like an incubus!
Please, don't be ridiculous
Watch your tongue!
- Calm down, gentlemen
- What's the matter?
The colonel took advantage of the dark, like a thief!
You swine! Enough of this!
I challenge you to a duel!
- I accept!
- A madhouse! One can't even sleep
Nobile's at the centre of it all, it's another of his schemes
Don't you see he's got an upset stomach?
This is madness. Calm down and talk reasonably
Anything but physical violence!
It's not like us!
Remember your upbringing, remember who you are
I'd like to know if Nobile provoked this
We'll show him he can't play with us
I prefer not to answer, gentlemen
There's a limit to our patience
Rita, trt to pacify him
I'll never forget how you've ridiculed me
- I'd rather have food than fighting
- Leave me alone!
How could you?
Even the strongest are losing their heads
Have pity on me
Cristián, please, evert problem has a solution
I beg your pardon, yours and evertone's
I was out of my mind.
I was not myself
Please forgive me, madam
May I make a suggestion which
I hope you will approve of?
To avoid lamentable brushes in future...
...ladies should sleep on one side of the room, men on the other
Remember you are speaking to gentlemen!
He's a degenerate. He enjoys insulting us
- Edmundo is right
- I just thought...
Don't trt anymore, can't you see that...?
Thank you
Remember now, behave yourselves.
Let's go
- Where are you going?
- They're Ugalde's children
We're going to look at the house, their parents are inside
- Go ahead
- Thank you
I'm sure I can go in and talk to them, if they're still alive
- Are you sure?
- I'll show you
Won't you let me? Then I'll tell the Press!
I need to be listened to,
I'm sure I can solve this business!
Another maniac
Go on, Johnny, don't stop
- Why have you stopped?
- Go on, Johnny?
- He must not stop
- Keep going, child!
Why run back?
You can't trust children!
- Come on, trt again!
- No, let's go
So as not to fall into total apathy...
...we must keep the place clean and tidy
We'll organise cleaning teams
How are you?
- All right, except for my head
- You poor thing
If it weren't for him and Leticia, they'd act like savages
I'll never forget their defence of you
I had a presentiment before going to the opera that night
I heard a voice insisting:
"Take the keys, take the keys"
The keys?
In the cabala, a key is anything which opens the doors of the unknown
Now, Blanca, hold that firmly.
Like this
And you, Silvia, the other one, like this
Victim!
I can't feel anything, we need innocent blood
We must await the sacrifice of the last sheep
- What's the matter?
- Look!
In the cupboard...
Listen evertone...
- What's the matter?
- It's over
Eduardo, Beatriz...
Doctor, in there!
What's going on?
Leandro, Colonel, help me.
Keep evertbody away
Let me see, Alvaro
- How did they do it?
- It doesn't matter. Back off
They slit their wrists
What's so funny?
I was thinking...
...what if I pushed you into the other room?
I'd kill you
What does that mean?
They've lost whatever reason they had
It's a Masonic call for help.
They must go to each other's aid
But here... unless, of course, the bear...
Cristián, the time has come to speak the unutterable word
C... H... I... H... H... O... H
Shut the windows!
Save yourselves!
They're coming in their millions!
- It's late, my boy. Off to bed
- I'm not sleepy
- So many people!
- He died in mortal sin
My dear child!
I shall never see you again!
Look, at the summit!
Can you see him?
- The Pope!
- Yes, it is
So solemn and majestic, like a warrior
I'll tuck you in
- Good night, my dear
- Good night, Mum
Nothing! The same as usual, like a tomb
- Why the quarantine flag?
- It could be an epidemic
- Typhus would be better than this
- Pablo!
What brings you here?
The same as you, to see if there's any news
- Maybe they're all dead
- You think so?
Sometimes you can smell the stench from here
Perhaps it's the food rotting in the kitchen
Don't shoot! No, don't kill it, please!
It's quite tame. I work here
The cook and the maids...
- You told them we were coming?
- I've not said a word
- What are they doing here?
- I don't know
Let's find out.
Perhaps they've heard some news
RaÚl says we'll be free if Nobile dies
Dead spiders spin no webs
If he had any dignity he'd know what to do
He's hiding with Leticia
Stop that! It's the most decent thing you could do
Speak up, gentlemen. Let's all hear your plotting
We want to get rid of him
Are you mad? That's completely irrational
We don't want reason, we want to get out
- If you're looking for a fight...
- Alvaro, stand aside!
- We've nothing against you two
- We're justified by necessity
- Kill him!
- Better late than never!
- Listen, fools!
- Kill the doctor, too
Why is he trting to stop us?
Think of the terrible consequences of your actions
This won't be the last vile act
It means the disintegration of human dignity. It's bestial
Stand aside, or I won't answer for your safety
Enough of talking!
Get him!
- That's enough, RaÚl!
- You stay out of this!
Look, it's Nobile!
There's no need for violence. You can have what you want easily
Thank you, Leticia
Just a moment. Stand still
- What's the matter?
- I don't know
Yes, now I know
It's really extraordinart
How long have we been here?
I've lost track of time
Think how often we've changed positions during...
...this terrible eternity
It's like a chess game.
We have made thousands of moves
We've even moved the furniture hundreds of times
Yet now everything is just as it was then...
...people and furniture...
...the scene as it was that night
Is it another hallucination, or is it true? Tell me, Alvaro
- Tell me!
- It's true
I was here and you were beside me, weren't you?
And I was sitting here
We sat here and I held your hand in mine
- Who remembers?
- After dinner I sat at the piano
- You were there
- It's true!
That's all vert well, but what's the point?
Can you remember what you played?
Perfectly
The last piece I played was a Paradisi sonata
Play it again. Just the end.
Go on, play it!
Play it
You stood behind me. Go on, get up
You were clapping
You rose from the piano, someone came up to you
Who spoke first?
Make an effort!
Trt to remember!
An exquisite performance
Answer. What would you have replied?
Yes, yes
I'm sorrt we have no harpsichord for you
How superb it would be with a harpsichord
Now something by Scarlatti,
I beg you
It's late, isn't it?
It's three o'clock
Excuse me, but it's late and I'm tired
We're all tired and we want to go home, don't we?
Let's go, then! Come on, follow me!
Follow me!
This way!
- It's good. Brandy from the house?
- My last bottle
Look! There's light!
Camila, come here.
Look, the light's on
- It's them
- My goodness!
- Let's go in
- After you
Why not wait for the faithful to leave?
- Wait? Why?
- Well...
- Father...
- Yes?
Something's wrong
- Let's wait a moment
- A good idea
I've forgotten my missal
- Why are they not leaving?
- Let me through
I'll explain
- You go first
- I'm in no hurrt
What's going on? Let's go
The End

ALL MONSTERS ATTACK
Out of the way!
- Minya sounds like that.
- Minya?
Minya makes a sound like that car.
You're living.
I don't think he sounds like that.
It may not be that exactly, but it's like that.
Son, are you going home now?
Oh, father!
I've got to work late!
Be good until mother gets home!
Okay.
I'll be good!
What is it?
I found a radio tube.
You can't keep that!
Put it back!
Hey!
We're going to have to work a little later.
Hey, are you having any trouble with your kid?
What do you mean?
He just seems to be awfully quiet.
It's normal.
Really?
Well, it's hard to understand kids today.
We have to take a step back.
Everyone is so hard at work that we forget about the kids, huh?
Do you know of a solution?
I'll give up this life when i save enough money and move us out of the city, whenever that will be.
Get a load of this!
They found the getaway car of the crooks who stole •50.000.000 by the trains!
If it was by the trains, those crooks could have boarded them and be anywhere by now.
•50.000.000 yen...?
Hey, let's go play in that building for a while.
We shouldn't.
That building is closed.
I know how to get in there!
But... we could get in trouble.
There's no one in there.
All of the kids play here.
You were to wait for your mom...
We shouldn't.
Hey, let's go home!
We'll be alright!
Ichiro, it's Gabara!
Hurry, let's get out of here!
Sachiko, what are you doing there?
Oh, mother!
You know you shouldn't be playing around here.
Ichiro, you should hurry home.
Your mother will be worried.
Goodbye!
Hey, Ichiro!
I bet you stole that radio tube!
You're wrong!
I found it over there!
- Liar!
- It's true!
You can't find anything good there!
- Well, i...
- Give it here!
He did it!
But, i really found it over there!
If that's so, then go over and honk the horn on that guy's motorcycle.
That man is working!
He won't do it because he's scared!
Do it if you want this back!
I won't!
You're a chicken! Nyah, nyah!
You're a chicken! Nyah, nyah!
All units, the two fugitives wanted for the theft of
•50.000.000 from the bank are still at large.
Report to headquarters for new assignment, over.
This is car 11-5, roger.
Ichiro, are you heading home?
Oh, Ichiro.
You'll find the key in it's usual place.
What's that?
This?
It's a new toy.
I call it a TV computer.
- A TV computer?
- Yes.
What does this computer do?
Can it do things like homework?
It stores data.
But, hey... let me show you.
Just push this button and...
"Kids, the moon is 1/50th the size of our world. "
How about it?
Would you like to learn more about the moon?
What do you think?
The moon is a neat place, but there's another place that i'd rather visit.
Where is that?
Monster Island.
Monster Island?
Minya lives there, along with Godzilla,
Rodan and Kumonga.
All of them live there.
And they all beat up on Gabara.
Gabara?
What monster is named that?
He's someone that always wants to fight.
Oh, you mean that kid in school you call Gabara.
Was he picking on you again?
Today, he took away a radio tube i found.
Why don't you stand up to him?
I would, but he'll knock me down.
If he knocks you down, you just get back up and try again.
But, it's hard when you're small like me.
Yoichi, it would be great it you could put all of the monster sounds in here.
See you later!
I see.
All of the monster cries, huh?
What monster's voice was that just now?
It was mine!
What?
Is that all?
"Ichiro, do your homework before you play. "
"I left some cake in the cupboard.
I'll fix dinner when i get home. "
"Mother. "
With the signing of the world treaty, it now goes to the United States
Congress for ratification.
And now for some local news.
Police are still looking for the two men who robbed •50.000.000 from a bank.
Today, they were inspired by the clues left behind.
The criminals abandoned their getaway car in an alley, and police believe they may still be in the area.
The police will conduct door-to-door searches in order to track them down.
Ichiro, i don't understand what's happened between us!
I can not stay with you any longer.
Can you try to forget about me?
- I will only bring you sadness.
- Ichiro!
Computer, computer... take me to Monster Island.
Computer, computer... please tell me all you know about Monster Island.
Computer, go ahead.
What?
Oh, the antenna.
Where is Monster Island?
Computer, go ahead.
Yes? Yes?
We're going by jet?
We're taking a jet out of
Haneda Airport?
Ladies and gentleman, thank you for riding with us on
Pan-Am Airlines.
We will arrive at Monster Island on schedule.
Monster Island,
Monster Island this is Monster 1-5.
We are ready to make our final approach.
It' Godzilla... and Kamakuras!
Gorosaurus!
Manda!
Angilas!
It's Oowashi!
It's Kamakuras!
Alright!
Minya!
Come over here.
I won't do anything to hurt you.
Really?
You don't need to be afraid of me.
Thank you for helping me out.
Why did you come to
Monster Island?
I wanted to meet all of you.
Won't you father and mother be worried?
They're never around when i get home from school.
It's Gabara!
Gabara?
Let's go!
Is that Gabara?
It is.
He's very bad.
Do you ever fight?
I can't.
He's too strong for me.
Well, i'm the same way.
- What do you mean?
- We both have our own Gabara!
Mother!
Yes?
This is toy consultant Inami.
Is this Ichiro's mother?
Yes.
I hate to be a bother, but would you mind looking after Ichiro a while?
It's alright.
He just fell asleep a little while ago.
What's the matter?
I'll be home tonight, but an associate is out sick and i'm filling in for her.
I'm very sorry about this.
Thank you for doing it.
- It's the police.
- What's going on?
Hey, you know those crooks who stole •50.000.000?
The police think could be in this neighborhood.
Oh, my!
Hey, wake up.
Hey, it's time to wake up.
Where am i?
Where did i go? Where?
Hey, hey, you're right where you were when you fell asleep.
Oh, no.
Why didn't you let me stay asleep?
Why would i do that?
I was just about to be introduced to
Godzilla by a very special friend.
Who?
By Minya.
Minya and i have become good friends.
Hey, hey!
Don't you go back to sleep on me!
I just got a phone call from your mother.
She won't be able to make it home tonight.
Really?
Again?
They always do this to me!
Relax! Relax!
Your mother and father work hard to make ends meet.
I got it!
Why don't you eat with me tonight?
Is that okay?
Hey, you'll be okay!
Well, come over to my place for dinner.
Minya, come get me.
Minya, come get me.
Minya, come get me.
It's no use.
Oh, no.
Hey, Ichiro!
Come here!
Come here!
- Ichiro's a coward!
- What a chicken!
Is nobody in here?
I'm right!
Gabara may have taken my other radio tube, but he won't get hold of these.
I should have guessed Gabara would come here.
Over there!
Headphones!
I finally found them!
Quiet!
Stupid idiot!
How could you do such a thing?!
What did i do?
When you looked down this hole, you driver's license fell out of your pocket and the kid has it!
Get down!
Hey, follow that kid home and get your license back!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't do that, you'll break it!
It's already broken.
It's okay for now, but if you break anything more... i'll never be able to sell it anytime soon.
I have my own driver's license.
Hey, hey, hey!
Why don't you take your toy license elsewhere?
Monster Island, Monster Island.
Monster Island, go ahead.
Monster Island, go ahead.
Mister!
You're interested in this car, right?
Well, i...
It looks old on the outside, but is runs good.
Would you like to speak to the owner?
Oh, this isn't you car?
Well, it's not, but i'm in charge of it.
How about it?
Let me show it to you.
- No... maybe later!
- Hey, hey!
What a cheapskate!
- Hey, Ichiro! Dinner time!
- Right!
Hey, what's the matter?
You haven't bad any meat!
I would... but it's not right.
What do you mean?
I don't want you to go bankrupt.
I won't go bankrupt over sukiyaki!
Did you sell your toy?
I think i did.
And for that, i'll make you my monitor.
Monitor?
I make a new toy, and as a child you can test it to see if you like it or not.
Well, can i monitor the sukiyaki too?
That's right.
Let's eat!
Hey, hey!
Gobbling you food like that is bad for you!
You won't be able to sleep!
Oh, that's right!
If you find that i'm asleep, don't wake me.
I'll be visiting Godzilla.
Godzilla?
Where is he at?
On Monster Island.
Minya is going to introduce me to him.
We're sorry to intrude on you.
What is it?
We're with the police.
We need to ask you some questions.
The car for sale outside, is it yours?
It is... but, isn't alright to have it out there?
No, no... that's not the problem.
Do you know of the criminals that stole •50.000.000 recently?
They may be looking for a car, and we wanted you to be sure to lock it securely.
Really?
Well, thank you for telling me.
Thank you.
We'll be on our way.
Let's go.
Thief! Thief!
Get away! Get away!
Thank you.
What do we do now?
I don't know how much longer i can stay here.
I'm hungry!
Hey, it wouldn't hurt to get some curry.
Hold it.
You held out longer last month when we were west of here.
I sure hope you can lead us back to where that kid lives.
I found him on the second floor of an apartment complex.
Alright.
Hey! Don't go to sleep!
Let's go finish this.
Hey!
Minya!
Gabara!
I did it!
Hi!
What?
It's you!
What are you doing?
I don't have any friends to play with.
Well, it's the same with me.
What brought you back here?
Well... i was hoping that you would introduce me to Godzilla.
Really?
I wonder where he is now?
You don't know where he is?
- I don't think he's very happy with me.
- Why?
Godzilla feels i should fight my own battles and start creating my own legends.
Wow, he's strict!
Oh, there he is!
Let's go!
Horray!
Horray!
Good luck! Good luck!
Go get him! Good luck!
Back up.
Back up.
Will Godzilla be alright under water?
He'll be alright.
He's very strong.
He did it!
He did it!
Godzilla is back on land.
Let's follow him.
Kumonga!
Godzilla's eve was hurt!
Alright!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Get going!
Get going!
Your breath isn't that strong yet, huh?
Well, Godzilla's just about to use his, and it sure is powerful!
Wow, that's great!
Look at that!
Godzilla is on the ground!
He did it! He did it! He did it!
What's the matter?
It's Gabara!
What is he doing?
Is he attacking?
Hey, let's get away!
But... Godzilla won't be very pleased with me if i run away again!
You can't do it!
Alright!
Minya, good luck!
Good luck!
Go get him!
Minya, run away!
Run away!
Okay, let's get out of here!
It's okay now.
I was cheering you on, but it's not enough against him.
Those are jet fighters.
The humans in them attack us whenever they pass over the island.
Hooray!
Hooray!
No, no, no, no...
I guess humans aren't the only ones who have to study...
That was great, Minya!
Stop squirming!
If you don't stop.
I'll use this! I'll use this!
Hey, see if it's clear.
Ichiro!
Hey, Kid!
What's the big idea stealing this?
- It's alright now, go get us a car!
- Right!
You're going to behave, okay?
Be quiet!
Stop your crying!
What kind of young man are you?
I'm a young man that's scared!
You just keep quiet!
- I'll take a bowl!
- Yes, sir!
Hello.
We meet again.
Are you still working this late?
It's been pretty hopeless so far.
Then you haven't found any leads in the investigation?
We've gone through this area, but the clues have been very scare.
I figured we would look around a little longer.
Hey, would •50.000.000 fill a bag?
Sure.
It would fill a bag about this big.
Damn!
What's taking him so long to get a car?
Just ignore me. Just ignore me.
Just ignore me.
Just ignore me.
Just ignore me.
- Minya. It's Minya.
- What?
You better watch out for Minya.
There's nothing to look out for here!
Minya... Minya... Minya... Minya...
Minya... Minya... Minya... Minya...
Minya! Hang in there!
I know you can do it!
That's it!
Minya!
This way!
Come up here!
Minya!
Hurry up!
I have an idea!
Hurry! Hurry!
This will work! When Gabara steps on that end of the tree, you jump on this end!
What will happen then?
It will send him flying!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Alright!
Let's do it!
Now!
You did it!
Godzilla, get him!
He did it! He did it!
He did it! He did it!
I knew Godzilla was the greatest!
Gabara's a chicken!
Gabara's a chicken!
Don't do it!
I'm on your side!
Stay back!
Somebody, help me!
- Help me! Help me! Help me!
- Hey! You're having a nightmare!
- Help me! Help me!
- Wake up! Hey! Wake up!
Keep quiet!
It's me!
It's me!
Stupid idiot!
What took you so long?!
Give me a break!
The tire was punctured!
The spare wasn't very good, either!
- I don't think that this...
- Do you have the car?!
The car is ready for us outside.
Your hankerchief...
Your hankerchief!
Are we taking the kid?
I'm not too keen on kidnapping.
Not his legs!
His hands!
We won't kill the kid.
We'll just take him with us.
He's going to be our insurance.
Sort of like a safety net, huh?
Grab the bag and let's get going!
Right...
- Hey, i...
- Hurry up!
Sit still!
Hurry up!
Damn, not another delay!
We have to hurry up!
Hey... you stay put, okay?
What's the matter?
Idiot!
Let me do it!
Whatever you're doing, hurry!
Godzilla feels i should fight my own battles and start creating my own legends.
Let me go!
Let me go!
You brat!
Stop!
Keep quiet!
Damn!
He's in here.
Let's get him and head for the car.
Hey, you check those rooms and see if he's in there.
Idiot!
Be careful, you idiot!
What do you expect me to do?
I'm not some animal that can see in the dark!
That's enough!
Come on!
- Hey, did you find him?
- No.
Damn!
- Where could he have gone?!
- He's not here.
Hey, you go down and watch the entrance.
I'll go check the second floor again.
Damn brat!
What's the matter?
- He's on the third floor.
- Good.
Hmm... this car looks kind of familiar.
Where have i seen it?
This is my car!
If this is my car, why is it out here?
This is strange...
What's this?
It isn't mine.
The thieves!
Well... i looked in my car and found a bag!
Yes, a bag!
I'm sure i didn't imagine it!
Damn!
You think you can get away?
Hey!
I found him! Hurry!
What happened?!
- Where are you?
- I... i'm here!
- But where is that?
- I'm below you!
You stupid idiot!
- Damn!
- What happened?
It's not broken.
Hey, where can i find him?
Up there!
Why didn't you tell me sooner?!
There he is!
Hold it!
Hold it, you brat!
Bastard!
Hey, stop!
Stop it!
Wait!
Here it is!
This is it.
- Uncle!
- It's Ichiro!
- Ichiro!
- Uncle! Uncle!
Get back!
Put your hands up!
- Drop the knife!
- Hurry up!
Hey!
Come here!
Put your hands in the air!
Come out here now!
- I'm sorry!
- Yeah, right!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Those two... Ichiro, did you catch them on your own?
Yes, i did.
It's all right... it's all right...
You did it, huh?
Good job.
- Go ahead.
- Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry.
You mother had to work again last night.
I won't do it again.
But... it's so we can live better, right?
Oh, my!
You and dad work any time you have to.
I'll be alright.
Breakfast was good!
- See you later!
- See you later! Be careful!
Boy, you faced the thieves on your own?
I wasn't alone.
Huh?
You weren't alone?
Who else helped you?
Hey, who helped you through the ordeal?
It was Minya.
Minya?
- See you later!
- Hey, Kid! Boy!
It's alright!
It's Minya... the monster.
I think i understand.
I think he believes that his ideas came from Minya.
- Believes...?
- Yes.
In a man's world, we have our god.
In a child's world, it's not difficult to view Minya as a divine guide.
Sachiko!
Did you tell your story to the reporters?
I want to see it when it's done.
Hey, Ichiro.
Will you join my gang?
No!
What?!
You're no good, Gabara!
I hate you!
Why you...!
I won't be bullied!
I hate you!
Stop that!
What are you doing?!
You shouldn't play with that!
Stop that...!
He did it!
Let's go!
Stop!
Hey! Hey!
Stop!
Father!
- Father!
- Yes, son?
Dad, do a favor?
Can you hold up that man?
- Huh? What's the matter?
- I made him angry!
- Huh?
- Hey! You! Stop!
You can't get away!
- Get going!
- Thank you, dad!
Hey!
Hey!
Wait!
I'm sorry.
What appears to be the problem?
- What kind of question is that?!
- Hey, what happened?
I've got paint all over me because of that kid!
- I didn't do a thing to him!
- I'm sure he didn't mean it.
Hey, Ichiro!
Mister, i'm sorry!
THE END
Who is the most self-reliant animal
made since the world began?
Who can be the most defiant animal
known to the world of man?
born with emerald eyes
so cold, so warm, so wise
within her kingdom lies
the world's arena
do we need to ask more than that?
you must know now it's a cat
but a very important cat at that
who's called...
Thomasina!
Thomasina
what are you thinking now?
Thomasina
what makes you so highbrow?
for I do think it very odd
if you are an Egyptian God
that the wee, little mouse
runs in and out his house
each time you blink or nod
Thomasina
though you may love to roam
Thomasina
don't go too far from home
there are beasties in the garden
who would never accept your pardon
if you left the jungle yard in
which we play
Thomasina
don't ever run away
Thomasina
come along with me now
Thomasina
though you've seen a
little bird leave the bough
Thomasina
even if it's a lark or dove, you
let them all fly away above you
but I guess I'll always love you
anyhow
Thomasina
come along with me now
Thomasina
I love you anyhow
Thomasi...
Yes, I am Thomasina.
This story's all about me.
I'm a self-made cat,
And here's the house
I live in
With the Macdhui family,
Whom I'd adopted when they first came here.
They started off by calling me Thomas,
But when they, well, got to know me better,
They changed that to Thomasina.
Humans are funny that way.
That the Macdhuis are a happy family
Is entirely due to me.
I made them what they are today...
Although I had to be murdered first.
Here's the scene of the crime -
Inveranoch, in Scotland,
In 1912.
And this is Mr. Andrew Macdhui.
From a cat's point of view, even before my murder,
He was a most difficult man,
Believe me.
His wife had died sometime before he came here,
So there was just himself
And Mrs. Mackenzie, his housekeeper,
And Mary, his daughter.
I'd moved in on them a few days after they'd arrived,
And on the whole,
I got on with them very well,
Though mostly because of Mary Macdhui.
She appreciated my rather special qualities
From the start.
Thomasina, there you are.
Of course I had this sort of thing
To put up with every day -
Fussed over, treated like a doll,
Being dressed up...
And over a fur coat, too!
Everything that happened to me from here on
Was due, in a way,
To a blind man and his dog.
Here they are now -
Tammas and Bruce.
Good morning,
Tammas.
Good morning, Mary.
Say good morning to Tammas and Bruce, Thomasina.
Good morning, Thomasina.
She's not in a very talkative mood today.
I have the same trouble with Bruce here.
He can be very reserved at times.
Isn't that right, laddie?
But what would we do without them, you and me?
Where are you going?
Oh, just to get some tobacco for my pipe.
Mind how you go, Tammas.
Och, Bruce is my eyes, lassie.
Come on, say goodbye to Thomasina.
Be good now, Mary.
Thomasina, it's rude not to answer
When you're spoken to.
Aah!
Hello, Geordie.
Oh, what have you got there?
I found him down by the loch.
I think his leg's broken.
He can't hop or swim or anything.
Oh, he looks fair sick.
Doesn't he, Thomasina?
Ah! Don't touch.
Why don't you go and ask my daddy to cure him?
Och, I don't know.
Do you think he would?
My daddy can cure anything -
Dogs and cows and cats and lions and pigs and...
Aye, but frogs?
And frogs.
Everything.
You take him in, then.
Och, I'm not allowed in the surgery.
You go, Geordie.
Well, if you say so.
I'm only saying I'm here against my better judgment, minister, that's all.
You'll be glad you listened to me, Dobbie.
Mr. Macdhui's a clever man.
Maybe so, but up till now,
I've never found much wrong with dosing Jock here
With Watson’s patent powders.
Ah, you must move with the times, man.
Macdhui's a man of science.
Aye. I Haven't heard tell much good of that.
Ha! Book learnin'.
Up at Kinkairale's farm, they're grateful enough to him.
Two hundred sheep cured of the foot rot
And not one lost.
Aye, you're a good persuader,
Mr. Peddie,
But farm beasts are one thing.
A man's pet is another.
You wait and see.
Och, I'll give him a try.
No one can say
I'm not a fair man,
But it's for him to convince me.
How old is this dog,
Mrs. Laggan?
Fifteen years and a bit.
I've had him since he was a puppy,
The year my husband died.
He's been ailing a wee bit this past year
But not so sick as this.
Well, he's very old.
The kindest thing would be to have him put to sleep.
Oh, no. You see how bad he is with the asthma.
The poor dog can hardly breathe.
He's in pain, Mrs. Laggan.
But you can't put Rabbie to sleep, Mr. Macdhui,
Or I wouldn't have come.
He's all I have in the world.
Couldn't you give him a wee bit of medicine
To tide him over till he's well again?
There is no medicine that can make him well.
He's very old, he's in great pain,
And his life is a misery to him, can't you see?
But I can't lose him.
What would I do without him?
Poor Rabbie.
Be fair now. It's yourself you're pitying, not the dog.
Oh, dear.
I don't know what to do.
I've told you what I think is for the best.
Now I've told you it's up to you
To make up your mind.
Very well.
I suppose if he is suffering...
You'll be gentle with him?
He won't feel a thing.
He'll just go to sleep.
Willie?
Fifteen years.
Poor Rabbie.
Poor Rabbie.
You're doing the right thing.
It's for his sake.
Oh, no, there'll be no charge.
Just leave him here with me.
You're leaving Rabbie to be cured, then, Annie?
Mr. Macdhui says there's no cure.
He's to be put away.
now, Mrs. Laggan, that's a shame.
No cure for him?
If it was my dog, I'd want a second opinion, I'm thinkin'.
I'll go with you, Annie.
Good day to you,
Mr. Macdhui.
Good day, sir.
Good day.
Who's next, please?
Please, sir, Mr. Macdhui?
Uh-oh. Who are you?
Geordie Macnab, please, sir.
I'm a bit of a friend of Mary's.
I found him down by the loch.
He's hurt his leg.
Can you make him better, please, sir?
No one can cure a hurt frog, Geordie.
You put him back where you found him.
But he might die.
Could you not mend his leg, please, sir?
No, nature's the only doctor can do that, laddie.
Come on, now.
Come on, off you go.
I'm busy.
You've lost another customer, Andrew.
Is there really nothing you can do
About old Mrs. Laggan's dog?
No, not a thing, just put it out of its misery.
Well, whoever's next,
Will you come in, please?
Oh, it's all right,
Mrs. Campbell.
You go in ahead of me.
I'm in no hurry.
hey, there's Geordie.
What have you been doing in there?
I took my sick frog to Mr. Macdhui.
Oh, aye.
What did he say, then?
He wouldn't even look at him,
And he's going to kill
Mrs. Laggan's Rabbie.
Kill him? Rabbie?
Aye, I heard him say so.
It's just like grandfather says about him -
He's only good with farm beasts.
He's not interested in people's pets.
A frog Will die if he can't hop or swim.
I'm not going to let him die.
What are you gonna do, then,
Cure him by magic or something?
Come on, Jamie.
Why don't you take your frog
To the witch woman livin' in the Glen?
She's supposed to do magic.
Well, why don't you?
Our mother says the witch woman's crazy
And we're not to go up there.
Och, you're just afraid, the pair of you.
I'm not afraid of anything, and neither is Geordie.
Are you, Geordie?
Right. Let's take the frog to her, all three of us.
I dare you.
Very well.
Geordie, we'll all go.
You want to get your frog cured, don't you?
We don't have to tell mother we went.
I was only joking.
No, you weren't.
You dared us.
I think you're afraid to go.
Me, afraid?
Let's go now.
Come on.
Keep up with us.
You'd think they were all telling on us.
Aye. Are you afraid to go on, then?
No.
Well, come on.
Whisht! Listen.
It's the witch singing and banging a drum.
She is crazy.
I want to go home.
When you've got this far?
What about your frog?
Put your box under the tree and ring the bell.
Aye, go on, Geordie.
We'll wait for you here.
No, no! Go on, Geordie. Go on.
Come on, Geordie.
Go away. Go away.
Go away. Go away.
Larry, come back here.
Oh, your leg is broken.
You poor wee thing.
Has somebody brought you up here to be cured
By the mad witch in the Glen?
Eye of newt and hair of dog,
Give me the power to cure the frog.
listen. Magic.
Off to my cauldron.
Where is my broom?
Och, you poor wee thing.
I don't know why
I bother
To dose that dog of yours.
The worst thing that's wrong with him is his owner.
Don't give him sugar.
Aw, but he has a sweet tooth, Andrew.
Poor old Finn.
Look how pleased he is.
You think more of his affection and gratitude for you
Than you do of his health.
All you people with pets are the same.
That's why he's too fat, poor brute.
"brute," he calls you, Finn.
Oh! That's part of the reason
Why folks here are slow to accept your doctoring.
You show no feeling for the sick animals you treat,
The animals they love.
Are sentimental about, you mean, to the point of not knowing
What's best for them, like you and
Mrs. Laggan who was here just now.
Poor old Annie.
Poor old Annie.
Poor old brute of a dog, you should say.
You thought I was hard on her just now, didn't you?
My job is to relieve suffering in animals.
The tribulations of the soul
I leave to you.
She'll get over it, angus.
Aye, but when someone you love dies,
Something of yourself dies, too.
You think you have to tell me that?
Oh, I'm sorry, Andrew.
Forgive me.
That dog of hers was all old
Annie Laggan had left to love.
At least you're not alone.
No.
Look at her now.
Thomasina, where are you?
Thomasina?
Be careful.
It's the jungle.
It's a million Miles thick.
It's full of lions and tigers.
Thomasina!
Thomasina, come back!
Have you lost something, Mary?
Shh! We're hunting lions.
Lions? Here?
Geordie, where's your frog?
Did daddy cure him?
No, he wouldn't try.
We took it to the witch in the Glen.
You didn't. I did. We all did.
You saw her?
Is she a real witch?
Aye, we saw her chant magic over the frog
And take it into her house.
Did you speak to her?
Och, no. She's queer in the head.
She's got a big drum in the house.
She bangs on it and sings awful weird.
There's all kinds of animals there.
Did she fly on a broomstick?
Well, not exactly fly.
But she had one, though.
Weren't you afraid?
Well, I wouldn't recommend just anybody goin' up there.
You were afraid.
You made Geordie take the frog to the tree.
That was you.
I wasn't afraid.
You must be awful brave.
I am... A bit.
Uh... Remember, angus,
Just keep him off the sugar.
Well, I can try.
Hello, Mary.
Geordie Macnab took his frog you wouldn't cure
To a witch who does magic and flies on a broomstick.
She could have turned him into a frog,
And it would have been all your fault.
Mary, Mr. Andrew,
I'm waiting for you.
Come on, now, inside.
Wash your hands.
Thomasina!
Never mind Thomasina.
Dinnertime!
Come on, now, inside.
Wash your hands.
There's a good girl.
That's enough about witches.
Mrs. Mackenzie Will tell you the same as me -
There aren't any outside of storybooks.
Oh, yes, there are.
She been making up more of her fairy tales?
I didn't make it up. There is a witch in the Glen.
Och, the Glen.
She bangs a big drum in her house.
And lives with wild animals and rides a broomstick.
Jamie Macnab told me.
He and Hughie and Geordie saw her.
They're filling your head with nonsense.
And for the hundredth time, Will you not feed that cat at the table?
Especially with meat.
She likes meat, and there is a witch.
Now, Mary...
It's a poor wee soul called Lori Macgregor
That's rented a croft in the Glen from Mr. Peddie.
She spends most of her time weaving on a handloom.
That's the "drums" your friends heard.
Now what do you say?
She's a witch.
She's a wee bit weird, that's true enough.
It seems she's a lassie
That doesn't mix with other folk,
But, mind, she's not been there long.
Some of the shepherds in the Glen say
She has a rare way with beasts and birds and that.
Now, mind Thomasina doesn't spill her cream.
Cream?
Oh, just a wee drop,
Mr. Andrew.
It helps her to see in the dark.
She told me so.
Didn't you, Thomasina?
There, you hear?
Ask her if she'd like me to go out and get my rod and catch her a salmon.
Thomasina...
She says, no,
She'd rather go to the store on market day
And choose her own fish.
Aye.
Come on, now, no more talk about witches or magic.
Just say your prayers, get into bed.
And look after mummy in Heaven and us down here,
Especially daddy and Mrs. Mackenzie
And Willie and Geordie and Jamie and Hughie and Tammas and Bruce
And Geordie's frog and Thomasina and me.
That's all till tomorrow.
Yours truly, Mary. Amen.
Good night, yours truly Mary.
Slippers?
Up. In you get.
There we are.
Good night.
Good night, daddy.
Thomasina.
I've told you about that before, my bonny.
You mustn't keep that cat on the bed at night.
There.
Oh, please let me have her.
No, you can have your doll if you like.
I don't want my doll.
Please.
She must go out and you must go to sleep.
Go on, lie down.
There's a good girl.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night, Thomasina.
You know.
Yes, I knew,
And Macdhui didn't.
This being put out for the night
Was just nonsense.
I could get in again anytime I wanted to.
Mary and I had it all worked out.
It was as easy as that.
Thomasina.
Thomasina, come on up.
But not tonight.
I'd remembered it was Wednesday,
The night before market day.
They set up the stalls at dawn,
So Wednesday's always my night out.
And just when I was beginning to feel like breakfast,
The market was getting ready to provide it.
Fish, fresh fish,
And the best sauce for it -
The danger of helping myself...
...Which needed cunning and caution,
A lot of caution...
And speed!
You, get out of the way!
Get out!
Mary?
Mary, come and have your breakfast.
What's the child doing?
Mary!
I can't find Thomasina.
I've looked everywhere.
She can't be far away.
Come on, now, sit down.
She didn't come home last night.
For what we're about to receive,
May the lord make us truly thankful.
Amen.
I'm not hungry.
Daddy, she must be lost.
Of course not.
Cats don't get lost once they've decided to move in on people.
She's just had a night out and hasn't come back yet, that's all.
She's been out all night before,
But she's always come back.
She climbs up the tree and gets in my window.
What?
She always has.
It's our secret.
Aye, it certainly is.
Well, I'm off to the surgery now.
Be a good girl.
Eat your breakfast.
Don't worry about the pussy, child.
But she's lost.
Thomasina's too clever to get lost.
You do like her, don't you?
Aye, of course.
Would you do anything for her if I asked you to?
Promise?
Aye.
Well, let me go and look for her now, please.
You promised.
You're even craftier than
Thomasina, you wee monkey.
We'll split up.
Mary, you come with me.
Hey, what are you lookin' for, son?
A lost cat.
Have you seen one?
Not at my stall. Away you go. Go on. I'm busy.
She's a big... Mrs.
Macfarland, what would you like?
Nice cabbage.
Have you seen a lost cat?
Thank you very much.
Drat the cat!
Och, it's not Thomasina.
But never mind.
We'll find her.
Hughie, Mary,
I've found her!
She's here, Mary!
Oh, Thomasina.
Give her to me.
I don't think anything's broken,
But she's terribly stiff.
Oh, poor Thomasina.
I couldn't help it, constable.
He walked right in front of me.
it looks like Bruce.
Bruce? My Bruce?
What's all this about?
Och, Mr. Macdhui.
You're just here in time.
It's Tammas' Bruce.
Where is he?
Steady now, Tammas.
Steady.
He's fair crushed, sir.
I couldn't help it,
Mr. Macdhui.
Better get him back to the surgery - quick.
Bruce is my eyes,
Mr. Macdhui.
Can you save him? I'll do what
I can. Stay with him, angus.
He's in good hands now, Tammas.
Now, come on, you come with me.
This is going to take a long time.
I hope his heart
Will stand it.
Are you ready?
The Spencer wells, Willie.
How is he, Willie?
He's doin' fine.
What are you children doing?
Mary, go away from here.
Daddy, it's Thomasina.
She's hurt.
Go away, child.
Please look at her.
She's awful sick.
Here, Willie, take this cat.
Daddy, daddy, please look at her. Please make her well.
Mary, you mustn't stay here.
Now, listen to me.
I've got blind Tammas' dog here. He's badly hurt.
Well, so is Thomasina.
If you only look at her!
All right, I'll look at her, but go away, all of you.
You'll make her well?
You promise?
Yes, I promise, but go on out.
Come on.
Out, all of you.
I think you better look at her, sir.
Not now, man.
We got work to do.
Mr. Macdhui, sir, look.
Quick, get her out of here, and that cloth she's laying on.
That cat has tetanus.
Get her out of here.
Deal with her, disinfect your hands and hurry back.
But, sir... Mr. Macdhui, you promised the child.
The cat is beyond help.
Will you do as I tell you?
Hurry up, man.
We've the dog to seal.
Aye, I Will.
I Will.
Nearly an hour already.
How much longer can it be?
Aye, the waiting is hard.
Well, Bruce Will live, Tammas.
He'll even walk again.
Thank God.
Take me to him.
Not now.
He's still unconscious.
But I'll send Willie round to fetch you this evening.
Bruce Will know you then.
And he'll get better?
Aye, be as good as new.
It's a great skill you have, Mr. Macdhui,
And no one can deny it.
There now, what did I tell you?
Come on, Tammas,
I'll take you home.
God bless you,
Mr. Macdhui.
God bless you.
His pulse rate's fine.
I'll stay with him till he wakes.
Aye, he'll do.
I never thought to see such a surgery as that.
Aye, and what you have to do now
Will be just as hard,
I'm thinking.
You have to tell the child about her cat.
"the shoeblack tries his bread to earn
"and would an honest penny turn.
"when mud upon our boots leave stains,
"his ready help good payment gains.
The beefeater we see today... "
Daddy, Thomasina - is she better?
She's out of pain, Mary.
What was wrong with her?
Let me go to her.
She is better, isn't she?
Mary, uh, now,
Will you listen?
Listen to me just a minute.
You see, there are some things
That you have to learn to face,
Even if at first they seem a bit unfair.
Where is she?
Thomasina's wound was poisoned,
And she might have made other people's pets ill, even die.
But you did save her?
I- I couldn't, Mary.
I couldn't.
See, there are some things your daddy can do and some things he can't.
What did you do to her?
I, uh, had her put to sleep.
There was nothing else
I could do.
Now, try to understand, Mary.
No! No! You said you'd make her better.
You promised! You promised! Come on, Mary...
I'll never speak to you again! Mary, please...
He promised, and he's killed Thomasina!
She's dead!
I'll go up to her.
Aye.
And take everything she was wearing when she found the cat.
Everything, do you hear?
And burn what you can't boil.
I didn't realize she was going to take it so hard.
Could you not have saved the cat?
It was wounded, infected with tetanus.
I did what was right.
I'll get her another cat.
Can't I?
Well? Can't I?
Well, I'll buy her anything she wants.
Why did she take it so hard?
For a clever man,
You've an awful lot to learn.
Don't be so sad.
You'll do yourself harm.
Look, I tell you what we'll do.
We'll give Thomasina the best funeral any cat ever had, won't we?
Aye, with a full service and everything.
My mother's got just the right box
That'd do fine for a casket.
We could pick some flowers and have a procession,
Like when Old Dougal was buried.
Everyone in the village would see us.
Aye, you'll wear widow's mournings
And walk behind the casket, weeping.
And Annie here, she can be chief mourner.
I can cry awful loud, Mary.
not now.
Will I wear a hat and a black coat?
Mrs. Mackenzie has one.
Aye, we'll all dress up and get everyone to come.
I know! Jamie's just learning the pipes.
He's not very good... I can play Macktintosh's lament!
I'll wear my dress kilt with my skean dhu and sporran,
And everyone in the street Will say,
"there goes the poor widow Macdhui,
"a-burying of her dear Thomasina,
Foully done to death,
God rest her soul. "
Will they? Really?
Aye. It'll be a great, great procession.
You'll see.
We'll go and get Thomasina now!
Aye, come on.
I opened my eyes,
And where was I?
They say that to die
Is a Journey from light into darkness,
But here was light again.
This was no quiet endless sleep.
I was flying,
Flying wildly,
Without weight or effort,
Diving, spinning,
Falling backward and downward
Into the mists of time,
Where my ancestors were worshipped
In the temples to bast
Thousands of years ago.
Bast, the cat goddess,
The goddess with the golden eyes
Staring and staring,
Drawing me upward and upward
And upward and upward.
Then there were flowers,
Flowers everywhere,
All around me, touching me,
And the sound of music
Wild enough to wake the dead.
playing
"mackintosh's lament")
Lord sakes,
What are the children a- burying today?
Mary Macdhui's cat
Thomasina.
My grandson Hughie told me
Her father couldna be bothered to cure its sickness.
His own daughter's pet.
Ah, well, maybe he was busy at the time,
You know, what wi' Tammas' dog,
And after all, it's a blind man's eyes.
His own daughter's pet.
It's hard to understand.
Right.
This is far enough.
Put it here.
Now get some stones and build a cairn for the grave.
Now get the coffin off
And put it down just there, you two.
Come on, hurry.
Now get some stones.
Come on, get some stones.
That'll do fine.
Now, let's get on with the service.
I'm going to take the service.
It was my idea.
No, you're not.
I'm the oldest, and I've come prepared.
Brethren, friends, and fellow mourners...
och! Go on, then.
We have come here today
To bury Thomasina and to praise her.
She was the friend of Mary
Macdhui here, who you all know.
Uh, eh, well, anyway, there she is.
Shh! Not yet.
Hold your noise.
Thomasina was one of the best cats in all Argyllshire,
And we all feel for her best friend and owner.
Whisht!
Not yet, not yet.
There is no doubt that Thomasina was a terrific mouser, too.
She had a few faults, aye,
But I won't mention them here.
Uh, and her mortal remains
Will now be laid to rest.
Now!
playing "the Bonny Banks
O' Loch Lomond")
by yon bonny banks and by yon bonny braes
where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond
where me and my true love
Will never meet again
on the bonny, bonny banks of Loch Lomond
oh, ye'll tak' the high road and I'll tak' the...
It's mad Lori.
and I'll be in Scotland afore...
It's the witch!
She's coming for us.
Run for it!
Run quickly!
She's a witch!
Run for it!
The witch!
The witch!
What were they doing?
Your heart's still beating.
Oh, poor thing.
Didn't they know?
You come with me.
Mary, come on in and get your supper.
Hello, Mary.
What have you been doing all afternoon?
Mary, your father's speaking to you.
Mrs. Mackenzie,
I've seen the witch
That lives up in the Glen.
What?
We all ran away from her...
Hughie and Geordie and
Jamie and Jock and Annie.
What's this nonsense now?
And what were you doing in the Glen?
And she is a witch.
I've seen her.
So there.
Mary, the... The kittens that
Mr. Peddie's cat Amanda had
Are now ready to leave their mother.
Would you like to come and choose one for yourself?
Mary!
Would you like to come
To Mr. Peddie's with me tomorrow
And choose a kitten?
Jamie Macnab can play
"mackintosh's lament" on the pipes
With only nine mistakes.
Answer me, Mary.
Answer your father, child.
But he's not very good at "Loch Lomond. "
This is ridiculous.
If this is her way of sulking just because...
Don't you want your supper?
No, I do not.
Now who's sulking?
Tell miss Macdhui if she does want a kitten, she'll have to come and ask me.
Everybody was real scared when they saw the witch, except me.
I wasn't.
I just looked at her and said,
"I'm not afraid of you. "
Oh, give me strength.
Oh, you and your stories.
Eat your supper.
Now you've made your father angry.
No, I Haven't.
My father's dead.
by yon bonny banks
and by yon bonny braes
when the Moon...
bright on Loch Lomond
Don't cry, child.
I Haven't seen you cry for a long, long time.
Look, Mary, I'm sorry about Thomasina.
I've told you.
I'll get you another cat,
Or maybe a wee dog to be all your very own.
Wouldn't you like that?
Now, look, child, I can't bring Thomasina back to life.
What's done is done!
Oh, very well.
Good night, then.
Oh, granddad, don't keep on about it so.
That cat's funeral was nothing but a children's game.
Not to some of us.
I'm tellin' you...
I've said it before and I'm saying it now -
That Mr. Macdhui is doing no good here.
Now, don't interrupt me, woman.
He's a townsman, not a highlander.
He has no feeling for animals at all.
Oh, come now, granddad.
Some of the farmers round...
The farmers?
Did you not hear that he made an order
To destroy the whole herd of Ian Macclennen's cattle
Because one cow was sick?
That's the law. They had foot-and-mouth disease.
It wasna the law in my day,
And it was only Macdhui's opinion that they had it.
and look at his record.
Never mind the cattle.
Annie Laggan's old dog Rabbie
- he had him killed.
He saved blind Tammas'
Bruce, though.
Oh, aye, that was because everybody was there watching.
That was just showin' off.
Now, granddad, you shouldn't say that.
Well, the man that did what he did...
And he wouldna even take the trouble
To treat his own daughter's cat when it was sick...
Is no better than a murderer.
It'd be a good thing if he went away.
I'd make it too hot for him here,
I'm telling you, if I was younger.
So would others.
Him and his newfangled science.
Mary!
Mary Macdhui!
Are you coming out to play?
Mary!
She won't be comin' out today. She's in mourning.
And anyway, we've got work to do.
What work?
Forming an anti-Macdhui society
To drive him out of Inveranoch.
Och, listen to him.
My grandpa said he's no better than a murderer.
Your grandpa?
And he told me Mr. Macdhui
Had two whole herds of cows slaughtered
Because he thought one beast was sick.
People are saying he ought to go, and I think we ought to join them.
And what does blind Tammas say about him?
Och, he's only one.
Now, here's what we'll do.
Me and you, Geordie...
Morning,
Mrs. Macleod.
Morning.
You're not thinking of taking your cat to Mr. Macdhui, are you?
Why not? Och, he won't bother with it.
He doesn't care for anybody's pets.
What?
He'll just say,
"can't be cured,"
And then kill it.
Get away wi' you.
It's true. He even did it to his own daughter's cat.
And Mrs. Laggan's dog.
He killed them.
I did hear about Rabbie, but he was awful old.
That cat of yours is younger than Mary's Thomasina.
You take him in there,
And he'll just get his bottle of chloroform and...
Just a minute, Harry.
Listen.
We were just telling Mrs. Macleod,
Mr. Wallis, about Mr. Macdhui.
You'd be well advised not to take your dog in there.
I'm thinkin' of rebuilding my pigsties.
You know, I've had two outbreaks of swine fever up to now.
Have you spoken to this new vet here... Uh, Macdhui?
Not yet.
Is he any good?
One of Mr. Macclennen's cows had foot-and-mouth disease,
And Mr. Macdhui had two whole herds killed.
That young Annie of mine
Took my best black shawl from my closet yesterday
And tore it into ribbons in some game.
Aye, I saw them playing at funerals,
Burying young
Mary Macdhui's cat.
Mr. Macdhui killed it.
Killed it?
Aye, the same as he did
Mrs. Laggan's dog.
He kills things.
He saved Tammas' Bruce, laddie.
Aye, because everybody was there watching.
That was showin' off.
He's an animal murderer.
You tell me he killed his daughter's cat?
He didn't like it,
So he took his gun and killed it.
His gun? Well!
Och! Isn't that awful?
Well, now, Andrew.
Glad I saw you.
I wanted a word with you about Mary.
I did what you said, asked her to come round
And choose one of your kittens,
But she'd have none of it, or me, either.
It's like speaking with a blank wall.
To a child of her age, feeling is stronger than reason.
You know that, Andrew.
Aye, and grief is usually forgotten quickly, too,
But the death of this cat, it's like an obsession with her.
Well, she's something of a loner child.
Forgive me.
She has no mother, and she needs someone to love.
She has me.
I'd do anything for her.
No child's ever been loved so much. Unselfishly?
What do you mean?
Tell me the truth, Andrew.
Were you maybe a wee bit jealous
Of that cat of hers?
The truth, now.
The animal had to be destroyed.
It would have died anyway.
You can take my word for that.
Angus, would you do me a favor? Do you think you could have a talk with her?
You might be able to reason with her.
Well, I can try.
I wish you would.
She's at home now.
You ought to be out playing in the sunshine
And not moping here indoors.
Geordie Macnab and Hughie came asking for you.
Why don't you go and look for them?
Oh, Mr. Peddie,
Mr. Andrew's not in.
I was just passing by,
Mrs. Mackenzie,
And I thought
I'd pay a call on Mary.
Would she be at home, do you think?
I'm here, Mr. Peddie.
Well, now, there you are.
You were so quiet,
I didn't see you.
It's fair warm outdoors.
You're wise to stay inside.
Would you mind if I sit down and rest a while?
Here?
Ooh, I think the stairs are a grand place
When you want to have a good think.
You know, I was thinking just now about your Thomasina.
What with my own cats,
I get all mixed up remembering what yours was like.
Thomasina, now, he was about...
She.
Oh, aye, she, yes.
Thomasina.
She was about, what...
So long?
And did she not have a wee square blaze on her chest?
No, it was round.
Round? Aye!
Now you remind me.
It was round, aye.
But she did have three little white feet, didn't she?
No white feet at all.
No? Oh.
But she had a pink nose
With two black specks on it.
I remember that well.
No specks.
No specks?
Do you remember
How she'd sit and look at you sometimes
With just the tip of her tongue showing?
When she was waiting to be fed.
Yes, when she was waiting to be fed.
You see, Mary,
Thomasina isn't dead at all,
Not really dead,
Not when we can remember her together like this,
Because she's alive in our minds. No!
And as long as you can remember her like this, she'll never die.
Just call her to your mind, and she'll come,
Even if you were to have another wee cat to love.
You know, I was saying to your daddy just this morning...
My daddy's dead.
I killed him.
Did you, Mary?
How?
I killed him.
I put him in a box with flowers in it.
We all took him out into the Glen and had a funeral,
And now I Haven't anybody at all.
Mary...
No! I like being alone!
Good day to you, Birnie.
I'm here to look at the bull.
I've let him out.
He's in the paddock.
Oh, right. I'll find him.
No need to, Mr. Macdhui.
He'll do very well.
Just tell me how much your fees are.
What's all this about?
I'll be no more needing a veterinary.
If there's anything wrong with my beasts,
I'll take them to the woman in the Glen.
She's a rare way with them and charges nothing, I'm told.
Is that where you're takin' the cow?
Aye, my man is.
What's wrong with her?
She's dried.
You have as much chance of getting pints of beer as milk
Listening to that rubbish.
I thought you were becoming enlightened, Birnie.
What I do with my beasts is no concern of yourself, Mr. Macdhui.
This cow has no disease reportable under the acts of the county.
Your bull didn't, either.
Aye, I didn't know then what sort of a vet you were -
Putting beasts to death whenever it suits you.
What?
Aye, my stockman heard it from his son at school in Inveranoch -
The dogs and cats you've no use for,
Even your own child's pet.
I see.
So you believe that,
And you're going back to the witchcraft and the superstition.
You said times change.
Well, maybe they're changing back again, Mr. Macdhui.
The old remedies are as good as book learning, sir.
Good day to you.
Apart from Mary,
I've another headache now.
The whole village seems to be boycotting me and spreading tales
About what a heartless monster I am.
Och, a few children.
It's having its effect.
In a few days, the people have forgotten
That the blind man's dog is alive because of me,
But they remember the few creatures that I had to have destroyed.
Be patient with them, Andrew. Patient?
Tell me something.
What do you know about a half-witted woman named, uh...
...Named Lori who pretends to be a witch?
Well, I rented her the croft she's living in.
I know that.
That's why I'm asking you.
And she's not half-witted, nor does she pretend to be a witch.
She's been labeled that, just as you say you've been labeled a monster,
Only she doesn't mind, because she wants to be left alone.
Well, she's not succeeding.
At least two farmers that I'd won round to scientific treatment
Are taking their beasts to her.
Aye, I hear she has a remarkable skill with animals.
What skill?
Without real knowledge, you can do great harm.
Would you take a sick child to a quack doctor?
Some people have natural gifts, Andrew,
And Lori Macgregor has the rare quality of mercy.
Since you know her so well, perhaps you'd tell her
To stop undermining the progress that
I'm trying to bring to these people here.
Why don't you tell her,
Andrew,
And tell me afterwards what you make of her.
Aye. Aye, I Will, one day,
And put a stop to her interference with my work.
Time passed,
And I began to see and feel again.
I couldn't remember any part of my first life,
Although something told me
I'd lived before,
That I was still me.
I'd heard that a cat has nine lives.
I accepted the fact, so...
This was my second life,
My life with a girl named Lori.
She was gentle and kind,
I'll give her that,
But she didn't seem to realize -
And neither did the other creatures around me
- how important I was.
There we are.
All of you -
Dorcas, Mack,
Molly,
Whisker - be nice to Thomasina now.
"be nice," she said,
But none of the others paid any attention to me at all.
They weren't really my kind anyway.
Thomasina, dear,
Go and walk in the sun now you're able.
There are others here who are not.
I wasn't important anymore,
Treated just like everybody else.
Now I knew how a king feels in exile.
Hughie, Jamie, quick!
what is it?
Come and see quick.
A badger.
He's been in the trap a long time,
And he's badly hurt.
What'll we do with him?
If we try and take the trap off, he'll only bite.
We could wrap him up in a sack, trap and all,
And take him to the village, to the vet.
To Mr. Macdhui?
We can't do that.
We're trying to get rid of him.
What else, then?
Couldn't we take the badger to the witch?
She's nearer.
Aye, that's true.
She couldn't cure a mess like that with magic.
I bet she could.
Mr. Macdhui would only kill it,
So let's wrap him up and take him to the witch.
Jamie, get the things.
I'll get the sack.
Careful now.
You've got him?
Aye, got him.
Seeing and hearing these boys gave me that
"I've been here before" feeling.
You know what I mean?
I knew them, and yet I didn't.
They made me feel uneasy somehow,
So I kept an eye on them.
Well, who's gonna take him to her, then?
You. You're the eldest, you're always telling us.
Aye, but - but it was Geordie's idea.
He's too big for Geordie to carry,
But if you're afraid...
I'm not afraid of anything.
Well, go on, then.
Put him by the tree and ring that bell.
Oh, poor thing.
Poor thing.
Oh, God, please, God, help me.
Wait!
Don't touch it.
But it's hurt, from that.
Cursed gin traps.
Look what it's done to...
Mind yourself.
Drop it. It'll tear your throat out.
It'll not harm me. No creature harms me. They're not afraid.
Put it down. You're mad. Aye, so I hear.
Get away from it.
Let me go. Let me go!
I'm sorry, but a wounded badger could half kill you.
No creature ever harms me. Don't touch him!
Leave him to me.
To you?
Why, who are you?
My name is Macdhui. I'm the veterinary from Inveranoch.
You are?
Now I see.
What do you mean?
You have the skill that I Haven't,
The skill that I prayed for when I found the badger.
Don't you see? You're meant to help him, and you must.
It's no use, I tell you.
It's too late.
Be kinder to put him out of his pain.
And wonderful to give him his life.
You have the skill for it.
Please, for pity's sake.
Don't go!
I've got to get my instruments.
They're in my car.
God, you sent him.
Please make him hurry back.
Well, that's it.
We'll have to see how it takes.
Still, they're hardy creatures with great vitality.
He has a chance.
Bless you and thank you for giving it the hance.
He'll have to stay quiet until the wounds heal.
Have you got a place where you can keep him?
Yes.
All right.
Are all these wild things in your care?
Yes, they come here to me.
Some instinct or guardian
Angel brings them.
And what kind of treatment do you give them?
Food, warmth, comfort and love.
And let nature take its course,
And that mends them.
And what about the other beasts that are brought to you?
Farmer Birnie's cow, for instance.
I know all about that.
What did you do for her?
I sent her back to him with a message for him to be kinder to her.
Ha. Like to seen his face.
And this?
I found him one morning by the tree outside in a box.
He had a broken leg, but he's better now.
Well, I can describe his guardian Angel to you.
He's about six years old, red hair, and his name is Geordie Macnab.
Well, keep your eye on the badger, Miss Macgregor,
And see that he doesn't tear off the dressing.
Aye, I'll watch him.
You know, um, in Inveranoch,
They, uh, they call you "witch,"
And if you can get all these creatures here to live together in peace,
Perhaps there's some truth in it.
The truth is that they have security
Because they've no fear.
Animals are not like people.
They only fight and kill when they're hungry or afraid,
Not for gain or to prove how strong they are.
You don't have to be a witch to understand that.
What made you come here,
Mr. Macdhui?
Well, I-I thought that, uh...
It's no matter now.
I must go.
I've work to do.
Wait. I must pay you for the work you've done.
Um, there's no need.
Will you take this, then, from me?
I made it here.
Then I'm glad to have it.
Thank you.
I knew the man...
And yet I didn't know him.
He reminded me of someone,
Something that was missing in my present life.
What do you think he's done?
Killed it.
But the witch wouldn't let him.
He wouldn't be likely to help her with magic, now, would he?
Suppose we had a look through the window.
It's our badger.
We're responsible for him.
Aye. Maybe if we were careful...
Come on, Geordie.
If she catches us,
You can say you came to see how your frog was getting on.
You want to know, don't you?
Come on, then.
Psst!
the badger's in here.
I think he's dead.
I told you Mr. Macdhui would kill him.
Here, Geordie, you're the smallest.
Climb up and have a look.
He's not dead.
I can see him breathing.
are you sure?
Look out!
ow!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Och! It's all right.
What's the matter?
What are you afraid of?
Let me go!
You're the one who brought the frog to me.
He's better now.
His leg has mended.
Do you want him back?
Then come and see him.
He's not very strong at hopping yet,
But he can swim all right.
He's going in with her.
She must have put a spell on him.
Here's your wee frog.
Look.
Oh, he's better.
Did you do it with magic?
With a powerful magic,
Geordie.
You know my name.
Cor!
Was it you who brought the wounded badger, too?
Is he going to be all right, please?
Did you do magic with him?
No, that was Mr. Macdhui.
What he did was magic.
Mr. Macdhui - does he do magic?
He has a wonderful skill that's almost magic.
He saved the badger's life.
Can I go now?
Don't you want to take your frog?
Thank you for curing my frog.
I'm not afraid anymore.
Well, not much, that is,
But I have to go now.
are you all right?
Yes. Look, she cured the frog.
But what about the badger? She cured him, too.
She put a spell on Mr. Macdhui and made him help her.
She's an awful good witch.
Hello, Mary.
Do you know what I did today?
Went up to the Glen to see your witch.
You know, she's not a witch at all.
She, uh... Isn't even what Mrs.
Mack calls, uh, "something weird. "
She's a bit like yourself -
Wants to be left alone.
Except that she's, uh,
She's got all kinds of creatures up there with her -
Squirrels and rabbits, stray dogs, cats,
Uh, wild birds
And a -
And a badger.
If I go up there again,
Would you like to come with me and see him?
Look, Mary,
I brought you a present.
look.
Something of your very own.
Och, I couldn't get nowhere with her.
She shows no signs of wearying of this game she's playing, that I'm not there.
And how do you play it,
Andrew?
Talk to her, behave as if everything was normal between us,
Read stories to her, but she pays no heed.
And that wee dog you got for her?
She'd have none of it.
I had to take it away again.
No, she won't forgive me, because I failed her.
At least, that's the way she sees it.
I think the trouble lies deeper than that.
You were the only human focus for her love.
That's why her shock of disappointment in you was so great.
Andrew, have you ever thought of getting married again?
No.
You need another focus for your love
Besides the child, and Mary needs a mother.
It's too late for me to fall in love again.
Oh... So you've seen
Lori Macgregor.
Aye, I've seen her.
What do you make of her?
Don't know.
She, uh, she has a-a strange way with her,
A strange skill that's instinctive.
I don't understand how she lives out there, cut off, alone,
And yet doesn't seem to be alone.
You should see her again, Andrew.
Maybe she could teach you that rare virtue.
You're in need of it, my friend, great need of it.
Good night, angus.
Hello, Miss Macgregor.
So he came to see Lori,
But putting a stop to what she was doing
Soon went out of his mind,
And he kept on coming to see her.
I've learned a great deal watching you.
If only I had the skill you have.
But you've a way of taking the fear out of these wild creatures,
Making them trust you, that I wish I had.
But I'm a witch, remember?
Aye, you must be.
You cast some kind of a spell on them.
I love them all.
When they're lost or strayed or alone in pain,
That's what they need.
I feel for them.
And you, with all your skill - do you?
I give them what I have, my knowledge of what to do.
I do my job.
Is that all it is to you?
You must have chosen to become a veterinary.
No, my-my father was one himself.
He chose it for me,
And he was a man that you didn't cross.
No, all my life,
I wanted to be a doctor,
Dreamed of it and worked for it.
You must have put a spell on me to make me tell you that.
Except for my wife,
I've never told another soul.
Only she knew.
"knew"?
Aye, she's dead now, about five years ago.
You say you believe in providence and in God's mercy,
And you wonder why I don't?
How can you not?
I loved my wife.
She did nothing but good.
She went out nursing the sick in an epidemic,
Caught the sickness herself, and died.
"the Will of God is inscrutable," they told me.
"God is love," they told me.
Which is true.
That's what she believed,
Yet the God who's supposed to be love allowed her to die.
And therefore you reject him?
Because your love died, his love has no truth?
Is that what you mean?
Ask yourself that when you've known pain.
I saw both my parents drown,
Andrew, in a storm at sea,
But my Faith didn't die with them,
And they wouldn't have wished it. I know that.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Forgive?
I'm glad you told me of yourself
And I told you.
Aye.
I'm glad, too.
I must go now.
The man's coming back gave me that feeling once again
Of there having been some other time,
Some other place...
And one night it came to a head.
It was as if something was pulling me,
Drawing me on
And on and on.
I knew the way somehow,
Although I didn't know why or where I was going.
Thomasina.
Thomasina!
Thomasina! Thomasina!
Come back!
Thomasina!
Thomasina!
Thomasina!
Thomasina!
Mary!
Mary!
Thomasina!
Thomasina.
Thomasina.
No, no!
Let me go! I saw her!
I saw her! Let me go!
You were right to call me.
She's in bad shock.
Could turn to pneumonia.
I see signs of it now.
I've done all I can for the moment.
I'll be around first thing in the morning.
Thank you, Strathsay.
What should I do?
Keep taking her temperature every hour or so.
It's just over 100 now.
If it gets any higher, let me know at once.
I won't leave her. Show the doctor out, Mrs. Mack.
You better get out of those wet things. You'll catch cold.
I heard the shouting, saw the doctor arrive.
Glad you came, angus.
I'm worried sick.
If she should catch pneumonia...
Aye, that's a great battle
For a wee bairn to fight alone.
Pray for her, Andrew.
Pray for God's help and mercy.
Pray.
Yes, pray, because if ever there was a man
In need of mercy, it is you.
You know I'm not a one for praying,
For goin' down on my knees.
Well, pray on your feet, man.
It's what's in your heart and mind that matters,
Not whether you kneel or not,
Though that would be good for your soul.
It's this stubborn pride of yours
That has made you live inside yourself so long.
I've forgotten how to pray.
I can't do it.
I can't feel the need for it.
Humble yourself, Andrew.
Humble yourself.
If you love the child,
Pray for her.
Oh, Thomasina, where have you been?
I didn't know.
From the present back into the past,
To the present again,
Where I was safe,
Protected,
And loved.
Where are you boys going?
Further up the Glen, granny. Well, you're not to.
They say in the village there's a witch up here.
She'll put the evil eye on you.
make way!
yah!
Hah! Hah!
Right, you devil.
You'll pay for this.
Come on!
What's he gonna do to the horse?
Let's go and see.
Aye.
Darvas, put the bear to his paces
And wake him up.
come on, get out.
Get out. Go on. Go!
all right, get him out.
Get him out!
Down you come.
Down!
Come on.
Now this way. Up.
Up now.
Come on, up and dance.
Come on, up! Up!
Up and dance.
Come on, you blackguard.
Get up and dance now!
This one's worse than the other.
The bear can hardly walk, let alone dance.
What are you doing under there? Get 'em!
Come on, boys, get 'em!
One gettin' away.
The other one's...
Got him down.
All right!
Let him go!
Come back here, you.
Get back to work!
Mr. Macquarrie, sir, there's some gypsies in the Glen,
And you've got to do something about them.
They're beating horses, and there's half-starved dogs
And a poor bear with a sore foot. It's true!
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
One at a time. Now.
We were up there watching them.
They're beating their animals.
Oh, they're awful people, sir.
You've got to arrest them,
Mr. Macquarrie.
I've already told them to leave the district and move on.
I gave them until tomorrow while they rest their horses.
rest them? You should see what they're doing.
You bring me a complaint from the proper person, and I'll act on it.
I don't take orders from a lot of children.
What proper person?
The county officer concerned
With cruelty to beasts -
Mr. Macdhui.
Mr. Macdhui?
Uh-oh, what's this?
How's Mary, please, sir?
We're sorry that she's sick.
Aye, she's very sick.
We hope she'll get better soon.
We Haven't seen much of her sin...
Since the funeral of Thomasina.
But we really came to see you about another matter, sir.
what's that?
To report cruelty to animals.
There's some gypsies up in the Glen
With performing animals.
They're awful cruel.
They've got a bear with a sore foot,
And they make him dance!
Constable Macquarrie said that if you were to examine them
And report them to him, he could put a stop to it, sir.
But I thought that my opinion as an animal doctor
Was no good.
Somebody called Hughie Stirling has been saying so.
Would he be a friend of yours?
He's no friend of mine, sir.
Hughie Stirling's a bit of a fool, sir.
Everybody knows that.
would you do something about the circus animals?
Aye, I, uh,
I Will when I can.
Well, uh, run along now, all of you.
He won't do anything.
He wasn't even listening.
Yes, he was.
He said he'd go when he can.
He doesn't care about those animals.
Well, we can't do any more, can we?
Yes, we can. We've got to. Hey, Geordie.
We could tell the witch about it - Lori.
The witch?
Aye, why not?
You say you're not afraid of her.
You could tell her.
Me?
She'd maybe put a spell on those gypsies,
Turn that big one into a horse or a bear and learn for himself
What it's like to be badly treated.
I bet she'd do it.
Go and tell her, Geordie.
Go on. I dare you.
Why, Geordie, hello there.
I came to ask you something, please.
Will you come in, then?
It's better if I do.
I brought you a present if you'd like it.
It's because you cured my frog.
Oh, Geordie, you didn't have to do that.
How is your frog?
Och, he's fine.
This is my present.
I made it myself.
What a beautiful pipe rack.
Thank you, Geordie.
It's just what I need.
I thought you might.
I was - we were wondering
If you'd do something else with magic.
Another frog?
Och, no.
There's a gypsy circus down in the Glen
With all kinds of animals and a bear,
And the people are awful cruel to them,
Beating them and that, and they're half starved.
Have you told the police?
Aye, and Mr. Macdhui,
But they won't do anything about it.
Mr. Macdhui won't?
No, we asked him, and he said so.
We thought maybe you could put some magic
On the gypsies to stop them.
Would you, please?
The bear's got an awful sore foot.
I'll go and see what I can do, anyway, I promise you that.
I knew you would.
Oh, thank you.
I have to go now.
She's going to do it!
She's going to put a spell on the gypsies!
You cannot stay in here all day and night
Torturing yourself, man.
You've had no rest, no food.
Rest? What rest can I have?
Strathsay says she's no longer fighting.
It's as if she's lost the Will to live.
Where is Strathsay?
He said he'd be back by now.
He said the fever must run its course.
There's no crisis yet.
He's done what he can for Mary.
We're all of us praying for her.
Praying?
I humbled myself and prayed, too.
I'd crawl on my hands and knees if begging for her life would save it.
She's lost and hurt, angus.
I can make no contact with her.
I wonder...
Perhaps someone who has the gift
For hurt and lost creatures
Could unlock the child's mind.
You mean Lori Macgregor?
I do.
Then ask her.
Bring her here.
She's unlocked your mind enough to make you realize
You're not sufficient yourself.
Stay here with the child, Angus.
Lori?
Lori!
So one night the man came again...
Lori!
...But this time he looked helpless
And lost
And frightened.
music playing)
Now let's get the bear out.
We'll have him on next.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing in there?
She's the witch the women speak of.
Come on out, you!
If you're in charge here, you should be ashamed.
Your dogs are sick, these horses past work.
The bear is... You're breaking my heart.
All right, then, you dance, witch.
you do the bear's act for him.
Come on.
it's the witch.
no! Aah!
Let -
Let me go!
Let me go!
Andrew!
you dance for the bear.
Look at him!
Look at Mr. Macdhui!
Who's in charge here?
I am. King Targu.
What right have you to knock about my people?
What exactly were you doing?
Driving out the witch who set the evil eye upon us.
Evil eye? I've heard about the evil you do with these wretched beasts.
What do you want here?
I have the power to close down your show for cruelty to animals.
That's what I'm going to do.
You'll pay for this.
Get him, and the witch!
Behind your back,
Mr. Macdhui!
I'm not standing for this. Come on!
Get the boys out of here.
Keep clear of this.
ooh.
Form a water chain! Quick!
Lori, get those children out of here. Quick!
Macquarrie, take that man in charge for cruelty to animals.
Here, give a hand here!
Try to hold still.
The bleeding has stopped, but it's an awful deep cut you have there.
Lori, Will you listen to me?
I've told you I'll not till
I finish dressing this wound.
You should have gone down to
Inveranoch with the others,
To a doctor, and not come up here to me.
Stop! Listen to me, m...
I am listening, Andrew.
I'm a wee bit scared not to when you're so fierce.
I was afraid of you down there in the fightin',
And afraid for you.
I came up here looking for you,
Just like the other strays and the lost that come to you.
Why?
My daughter is sick with pneumonia,
And I need your help.
I want you to come to her with me.
To your house?
Please come.
Why me?
Well, you have a
- a kind of a magic for the hurt and the sick.
I've hurt the child so much that her sickness is the worse for it.
You have? How?
Well, she had a pet that she loved more than anything.
I had to have it destroyed.
I didn't realize how much it meant to the child,
But in-in doing what I did, I...
I betrayed her trust in me.
I killed something in her.
Lori, you prayed yourself once, didn't you?
And you said that my coming here
Could be the answer to the prayer. Aye, it was.
Well, I prayed, too, and your coming with me now could be the answer to that...
For me, for Mary.
Will you come, please?
So... He brought you.
What have you been doing, man,
To get in that state - brawling somewhere?
How is she?
The same.
What is this?
Mary?
Mary Macdhui.
Do you hear me?
Andrew, may I take her?
Do what you Will.
What does this woman think she's doing? Let her be.
Andrew, there's so little of her left.
When the man took Lori away and they left me alone,
I was frightened.
I had to be with somebody.
The feeling grew stronger
And stronger.
Suddenly, like the lightning flash that split the tree,
Everything -
My other lost life - came back to me.
I knew where I belonged.
I had to go home.
Home.
Home.
Home!
Thomasina!
Can't be.
It's my Thomasina.
Yours?
I found her sick and nursed her.
Is she hers?
Is that the pet?
Thomasina! Thomasina!
Lori, call her!
Make her come in.
No, you must.
She must come to you.
Thomasina.
Don't you see that if Thomasina
Is the love your child has lost,
Only you can give it back to her.
Call her. Make her come.
Thomasina.
Come to me.
For the love of God, come to me.
I knew him now...
Macdhui, my murderer...
And he needed me.
Without me, he was lost.
So this was my Chance,
The moment of truth for both of us.
Thomasina.
Come to me.
Yet, because of my second life with Lori...
Thomasina...
...Because of what
I'd learned from her,
I didn't want revenge.
I wanted to come home.
Mary.
Mary...
I brought Thomasina to you.
She's come back to life again.
No, it's not a ghost,
Not a dream.
It's Thomasina.
She's come back.
It's Thomasina.
She's alive again.
Aye.
She's alive again.
And you're alive again, too.
I'm alive again, too.
So, my third life began,
With all of us together.
Not now.
goodbye!
And, to coin a phrase,
We all lived happily ever after.
{{{the end}}}
MATANGO
This is probably the psychiatric ward.
No... I'm sure that it is.
Everyone thinks I'm insane... but I know I'm not crazy.
They're all dead... every one of them.
No... I'm the only one dead.
It's true, the others are still alive.
Well, why didn't they return, you ask?
If you listen to what I tell you, it will probably convince you that I'm insane, huh?
It's so good to feel a breeze like this.
It let's me forget about everything.
Everything?
All of the garbage
I put up with in Tokyo.
You shouldn't say things like that.
Why not?
Tokyo is my favorite city.
All of my important things are there!
Oh, you!
What... ? Oh, no!
Hey, Yoshida!
You better forget about work!
Damn! This was going to be my best story yet!
That's what you always say.
Is this her first time on a boat?
It's alright.
It seems like she's not enjoying it.
Hey, it's my first time too!
You're different.
His girl won't even let him kiss her.
I don't see what's so funny!
What's the matter?
Teacher...
Are you feeling ill?
I'm not good at this.
I'm not very comfortable around them.
They're a pretty good bunch.
Give yourself a chance with them.
Do it for my sake.
Hurry it up. You can still work while you're listening to her.
She's a great sight for the eyes, huh?
That's so pretty!
So, that's Mami...
I wonder how she got into radio and television.
Someone's daughter... or wife?
Not exactly.
Maybe she's someone's mistress!
Well, cheers!
Just a moment.
This is bigger than a simple toast!
At this moment, we're on the open seas, far from the troubles of mankind.
- There is...
- Here you go again!
Aren't we part of mankind here?
I think it's quite clear that we're an exception to what I'm saying.
I'm going topside to take a look.
Hey, just a minute...!
I'm under orders. I'm the captain.
Well, here's to our new member, Akiko. Cheers!
Cheers!
We're going to have some rough seas tonight.
It's on the radio?
Yes. There's a low-pressure system heading west from the Kyushu area.
I thought we were going to have good weather.
The sea is already churning!
No, it's not that strong yet.
We should turn this boat around.
They want us to stay on this course.
We won't be able to go much further.
We're going to stay on course.
People act like children regardless of how old they are.
That's just the way the world works.
I'll take over if you don't want to go any further.
I'll continue on your course.
Well, you don't seem too confident about it.
I'd like us to keep sailing as we planned.
It should be fun going through some rough weather.
You're forgetting about the two women.
Don't worry about me.
I'm not against it.
Akiko...?
I'm alright.
Hey, it will be okay.
This yacht is the best you can buy, and it can weather any storm.
Captain! Captain! Come here!
What's wrong?
Alright... ready the sails!
Hey! Everyone on deck!
- Man the front sail!
- Right!
- Go!
- Go!
It's alright. Kasai told you so!
He said this is the best yacht money could buy!
Do you know how much he paid for it?
•40,000,000! I think he's crazy!
But anyway... he's going to take me to Europe in it!
Paris... Rome... Vienna...
It's wonderful!
I'm going to visit all of them!
Alright... we should be able to manage this.
The sea is pretty rough.
How are you feeling?
Not too bad, right?
Yes, really?
Well, I think we've had enough too.
Lower the main sail!
You're a professor of psychology, right?
About women... is it true that if a guy treats them bad... then acts sympathetic toward them...
They fall for him immediately?
That's the way all men think!
It's not psychology!
Hey! I'll be alright!
Switch places!
Are you okay? Don't worry.
Come on, relax!
Kasai! The engine, start it!
- The anchor! Throw the anchor!
- Right!
The mast is gone! Hey, get below!
Everyone, get below! Get below!
It's alright!
This yacht is too tough to sink!
I'm sure of it!
Hey, the radio's out! It blew up!
Hey captain!
This is all your fault!
The engine won't start!
How in the world are we going to fix it?!
What?!
Hey, where's Yoshida?
That idiot!
Damn!
Yoshida!
Yoshida!
Are you alright? Come on!
Hang in there!
Are you alright?
- Is he okay?
- Yoshida! Yoshida!
It's finally over.
It shouldn't be too long before they start searching for the yacht, right?
Naturally.
- We're drifting?
- Yes.
- South, I'd say.
- South?
Hey, where are we now?
Our direction-finder is damaged.
We're lost?
It seems so.
- How can a skipper like you...
- Skipper?!
If I'm the skipper, we would have returned to port the first time I said to go back.
You became the skipper then!
There must be something we can do.
Don't waste the energy!
We're not sure if we're going to need it!
It's time for the news.
the yacht was reported missing after a heavy storm.
The 7 people believed to be on the yacht are Masoko Kasai,
owner and current president of the Kasai-Sankyo Co
Etsuro Yoshida, a famous mystery novelist,
Mami Sekimuchi, radio and television star,
Kenji Morai, assistant professor of psychology at Yonan University,
Akiko Soma, a student of the university,
Aoyuki Sakuda, the skipper of the yacht,
and a sailor by the name of Senzo Yokoyama.
Because of the experience of the captain of the ship,
the Marine Bureau feels it may have survived the storm...
The batteries weren't very new.
A ship!
Hey!
Look out! Look out!
Look out!
What's wrong?
Hey, Yoshida! Yoshida!
Hang in there! Hey!
When is this fog going to go away?
Hey, how much water do we have left?
Be quiet!
You'll wear yourself out gabbing!
My head hurts!
What's going to happen to me?
What?
It's nothing.
Shut up!
Everyone knows... they all know what you're after.
They know why you didn't want to go back when the weather got worse.
No wonder why a woman is taboo on a ship... it's not because the gods are jealous of them!
It's more because they drive guys crazy in the head!
An island...! An island!
An island! An island! I see an island!
Hey, wake up!
Is it Japan?
I wonder if it's the Bonan Islands?
Is it deserted?
Well, let's find some food first, then we can look around the island.
It's getting foggy.
We better hurry and find something before the fog gets too thick.
Hey! Why go up there?
You don't have to come if you don't want to.
What's up?
Water!
Don't tell me that you can't hear it?!
It's water!
Hey! We found water!
Water!
Water?
These stones.. this island isn't deserted!
Someone built this by hand!
Hey, shouldn't we be heading back?
We think this path was man-made.
Let's go to the other side of the island.
We may find houses over there.
Hey, are we going to climb up there?
Be careful.
We're at the edge of a cliff.
Look over there!
It's a ship!
Hey, let's go down this way.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Hold it!
It's only a shipwreck.
Look at it. The sails are rotten.
I'd say it was beached well over a year ago.
But we should still go.
We don't know if anyone is still alive.
Hey... let's go, okay?
It's in terrible shape!
There won't be anything here but rotting bodies.
Don't say that!
I'll wait here. They would have eaten all of their food before they died.
Yoshida!
You girls wait here.
We'll take a look.
Let's go.
It looks pretty beat.
Someone could be living on board.
What happened?
The stairs are slippery. It's moss.
There's nobody here.
There are no bodies.
What unusual moss!
What was that?
What's with you?
I can't find a speck of food anywhere.
I'm going to see what's happening.
I can't stand waiting here.
That's a sea-water pump.
There's a geiger-counter.
This must have been a research ship.
The moss in this cabin is a different color.
It has no eyes!
It's an example of mutation caused by radiation.
Maybe the ship was studying the effects of a nuclear explosion.
I wonder why the moss hasn't covered these shelves?
Perhaps they're disinfected.
This alcohol lamp is clean too.
Chemicals seem to stop it.
This is carbolic acid.
If we scrubbed the cabin with it, it would be a perfect place to live.
What's this?
It's some kind of giant mushroom!
Matango... a kind of mushroom.
It's probably a new species found on this island.
We're in luck if this thing is edible.
Nothing else is written here.
What happened to the mirrors?
It looks like they were removed.
Hey... let's go.
This is the captain's cabin.
What's wrong?
What happened?
Stay out!
This is the captain's cabin.
We don't know if the logbook is in here somewhere.
Yokoyama.
Yokoyama!
You've found something to eat!
Who is it?
Don't look at me like that.
We found the food, and it's first come, first served around here.
Anyway, this logbook is all I found.
We can't determine what country this ship is from.
I have a feeling it was deliberately concealed.
The equipment is different as well.
Some is communist countries... the free world... and Japan, too.
Secret research, huh?
Involved in some kind of nuclear studies.
This certainly wasn't an ordinary research vessel.
We better figure out what we're going to do.
Just a moment! We should get Kasai.
He's had enough preferential treatment, huh?
What brings you to my door?
Hey, Kasai.
All of our provisions won't last more than a week at this rate.
You can't stay shut in this room all the time.
What do you expect me to do?
We need to plan for living here a month or two.
We're talking about that now.
We think you should come over to discuss it with us.
Oh, so you think I'm wasting my time?
I've been cleaning this up.
It should come in handy.
It should be able to get us some meat.
I think it will help us to stay alive.
Everyone, what's the matter?
Let's get started.
According to the logbook, this island is deserted.
There's hardly anything edible on it, so that puts us in a difficult situation.
Anyway, until we can leave here... we have to eat.
The canned goods will only last a week, so we have to look for food.
Fish... seaweed... turtle's eggs... anything we can eat, including snakes and lizards.
However, the mushroom should not be touched.
You mean it's poisonous?
We don't know for sure.
There seems to be a substance in them that damages nerve tissue.
That's all the records indicate, but there is other evidence.
It's unlikely that they would have left the ship, if they had an ample supply of food.
What we know from the log is that,
"Every day, several men went out
"to search for foods to add to their diet".
None of them ever returned.
Perhaps it was due to the mushrooms.
They grow in great abundance on the island.
Now, we should try to move the yacht to this side of the island in order to fix it.
This island is covered in fog most of the time.
Even if a ship passed by, we'd be lucky if they saw us.
So we should ready it for sailing.
Fix that thing?! Sorry, I'm out.
It just needs a little repair!
You won't get me on it.
If we're near the equator, that means Japan is far away, and I don't think we'd make it.
Japan is pretty far away, but I'm sure we would be rescued by a ship on the way.
On a ship, you're the skipper... so you give the orders, which is fine by me.
This really isn't a ship anymore... just a house on land.
Yoshida!
It's time you two stop running things!
Who are you to judge?
If you have a better idea, why don't you tell us?!
We shouldn't argue!
Everyone will have to do their share so we can get out of this.
The women will get the water.
You can go hunting if you want.
Whoever doesn't work on the boat should make an S.O.S. fire on top of one of the mountains.
I understand.
You take an awful lot of notes.
I'm glad I don't work that hard.
I use the thoughts of those I hire.
That's what takes talent.
There's nothing wrong with borrowing talent.
It takes ability as well as intelligence.
You're right.
Civilization has progressed by borrowing.
Each generation takes an idea and improves it.
Novelists do the same thing, right?
Your table is over here.
She's decided to come with us.
I'd like to come along.
We've walked a distance and haven't seen anything yet.
Weren't all the mirrors on the ship missing?
I wonder why they would bring them up here to break them?
There must be a reason.
Why'd he do that?
Do you think he saw us?
No. It seemed like he was avoiding the island.
Hey, that's not good.
The birds won't come near this island?
Sakuda!
Over there!
This island is a ship's graveyard.
Maybe it's the current.
It drags them off course, and they smash against the rocks.
Idiot!
Don't call me an idiot.
I came over here to help you.
Let's go.
Mushrooms.
I'd take a chance with them if i was starving.
Hey...
Hey, it was around here.
I'm sure I saw something.
Did we imagine it?
What? There's nobody here?
Hey!
What?
Someone's looking in here.
Who is it?
You can't trust any of the men around here!
This will fix him if he tries again.
What's the matter?
Something's wrong with the batteries.
Who is it?
You heard it?
Yokoyama.
Yokoyama!
Was that you?
I don't know.
Where did you go just now?
I don't need your permission to use the bathroom!
Who's there?
It's us.
What is this?
We're sure someone's walking on the deck.
Could it be Kasai?
Who are you?! Stay away!
What happened, Kasai?
What happened? What's the matter?
Hey!
Yokoyama! Yoshida! Wake up!
What's wrong with all of you?
In Tokyo, you guys know how to get around.
But on this ship you've become idiots... seeing ghosts in your head and believing it's haunted!
There's a reason for this, and I know what it is.
It's these women.
They're on your mind all the time and you can't do anything about it!
That's what's wrong with everyone.
It gets to me too, and drives me crazy!
Tonight,
I may just do something with you.
Are you men going to let him behave this way?
None of them seem to give a damn.
Damn!
- I'll kill you!
- Come on!
- Stop it!
- Let go!
That's enough of this!
Something else about her... she goes into the jungle with the writer quite a lot.
Seems they're carrying more than just water.
What do you know of my affairs?!
Hey... she's not denying it!
I know what woman Mami is.
I don't need you to tell me.
He's right.
I used you to get one thing.
Europe is what I wanted, not you.
I've always found you repulsive.
What?
Stop This !
Yokoyama, are you sure we saw a ghost?
What do you think?
Come here.
Yoshida, you too.
I suppose that's our imagination.
Let's stop fighting each other.
We have to find food and fix the yacht so we can get away.
Is that all you've got to say?
All he's done is carry that gun around, and what can he show for it?
- Hey!
- Yeah, let me finish!
There's a lot of grass growing around here.
You can eat the roots!
You can eat the roots of a lot of plants!
You never thought of that, did you?!
What have you brought back for us?
You!
In Tokyo you use your head to make money... but it's not worth a damn here!
Here you have to work, so get to work if you want to eat!
Hey!
College professor... writer... you have to go out searching regardless if it's raining or not!
A miracle won't fall out of the sky!
Just because it's raining doesn't mean that we stop working!
You don't mind getting wet when you're swimming, this shouldn't be any different!
Akiko... Akiko!
Akiko... it's mother.
I'm stopping.
Even if we fix the ship, we can't leave without food.
I'm going to look for some.
What are you looking at?
What are you doing?
What's it look like?
I wonder who stole the food from us the other night?
I suppose the ghost stole the key and got into the locker.
Oh, that. It's too bad
I couldn't hold on to him.
You liar!
Where did you get the idea to show us empty cans and claim some ghost did it?
We knew it was you who did it all along, but we wanted to stop another argument.
You're pretty good at finding fault in others, but you better watch your own steps.
What are you doing?
Don't worry.
I'm going to hunt down the monster that everyone saw.
Yoshida, you can't do that!
We don't know if it's a man!
He could be a survivor of the ship!
I hope that it is a man so I can have a talk with him.
I'll be very interested to hear what he says.
A man thinks strange things when he's out of his mind.
His reality may be more interesting than ours, and it wouldn't matter what he ate.
Yoshida!
We didn't get much after working all day.
But we worked hard and did as much as we could.
You're right.
Sakuda!
Knock before you come in.
I'll hold onto these.
We can't trust you.
You'll sleep with the rest of us tonight.
I sleep better when I'm alone.
You're going to work like everyone too!
Bastard!
Who in the world helped you when your brother was ill?
I put you in college and gave you a job in my company!
That's right.
I thought you were my friend, but you were just using me too!
Great!
Then how about these?
What eggs are those?
Turtle, the top of the line.
There's two for each, 14 in all.
You don't get any if you're empty-handed.
I don't care,
I'm not hungry anymore.
Hey, did you eat some of those mushrooms?
Well, I wonder...
Anyway, don't make anything for me.
Alright, I'll give you •10,000 each.
It's not enough.
Yesterday you charged •5000 each!
The market for eggs won't last for long.
Alright... •200,000, okay?
It's a gamble.
Will I be able to use it or not?
I'll do my best to get off this island, even if I have to kill everyone here to do it!
So that's your game, you bastard!
You bastard!
I'll kill you!
- Come on!
Sakuda!
Hey! Stop it!
- Stop it!
- Yoshida!
Stop it now!
He was with her.
Is this about jealousy?
We agreed to leave them alone.
You had no right to fight!
All of them want me.
I'll kill you all.
He's mad!
I ate some mushrooms. Now you know.
I read a long time ago that mexicans ate them in order to increase their perception and gain a sense of well being.
Don't move!
Japanese legends mention laughing mushrooms, so I'm in good company.
The people who gathered them danced in high spirits on the mountains and were in touch with the gods.
Matango, according to your thinking, means a person no longer human.
That's fine by me.
Because when I kill you,
I won't be commiting any crime.
I understand.
We won't stand in your way.
Do anything you like.
I will.
The truth is...
I like Akiko better than Mami, so after you're all dead...
Let me go!
Get up!
Move!
What's wrong?
Get in!
Hey!
What's the matter?
You're going to start living with the rest of us!
Sakuda!
It looks good.
You've done a lot to the yacht.
- Isn't it ready to go yet?
- Are you going to help?
Yes, in any way.
The truth is, can I talk to you?
What do you plan to do now that everything is different?
Hey, are you listening to me?
Yes.
There's 24 cans of food left.
Not much.
But for two people... maybe ten days.
Hey, how about the two of us leaving?
If we had potatoes and seaweed, we could last for weeks!
There's plenty of water.
I'm sure the two of us could stay alive for at least three weeks or so!
We could be found by a ship, or maybe find another island.
Get out!
I see.
The weak restraints of society disintegrate in the face of the will to survive in harsh circumstances.
The worse things get here, the worst we behave.
Is there a way to change everyone's feelings?
They made a mess here, huh ?
What happened, Kasai?
It's Sakuda!
He stole the canned food and left!
Damn!
Damn! He's gone!
I guess he didn't think any of us were worth saving.
I don't think he ever had a high opinion of us, but now that doesn't make any difference.
It's my turn to do something.
Mami, bring the girl over here.
- Bastard!
- No! Let go! Let me go!
I'm going to kill you both.
Start walking down the deck and don't try anything funny.
Teacher!
I wonder how many times I wrote something like this in my novels?
Yokoyama!
Get out of here!
- Kasai...
- You too!
Please, I beg you!
You wanted to be with him, get going!
I bet this didn't happen in your damn books!
Stop it!
It's been raining for a week now.
It must be it's raining season.
If you're right, we won't be able to live here very long.
Do you know anywhere else we can go?
We'll have to find a place.
Maybe we can find a cave.
Morai...
I'm finished... I can't go on.
Kasai, no matter how we feel, we can't give up.
How can we live if we do nothing?!
Stop it!
I wish you'd hurry and kill me.
I don't even have the courage to kill myself.
Don't say such things!
Anyway, relax for today.
He's right.
You rest here while we go out.
We're tough enough to survive, and so are you.
Let's go.
Mami!
You're still alive! How did you do it?
I haven't been hungry since I left.
Mami... help me! I beg you!
I've waited a long time for that... you begging for help.
Now you know how it feels to be desperate for help.
I'll help you... we'll go together.
The rainfall is making the mushrooms big and strong with each pitter-patter.
Where is the food?
A little further.
Walk this way.
It's delicious.
We should have eaten them sooner.
I should have told you that once you eat the mushrooms, you become a mushroom.
That's why all of the mirrors on the ship were removed.
But once you eat them, you can't stop.
Yoshida!
Kasai!
He's not here.
Teacher!
We're not beaten. We're not beaten!
Hey!
Sakuda!
Masoko Kasai, Kenji Morai,
Etsuro Yoshida,
Senzo Yokoyama,
Mami Sekimuchi, Akiko Soma...
These people are stranded on a deserted Island.
I went out on this ship to try and find some help, but I couldn't make it and died out at sea.
Captain Aoyuki Sakuda.
Damn!
I found the yacht.
The yacht?!
Then, Sakuda came back ?
Sakuda died at sea.
The yacht drifted back here.
Then no one has ever left this island, huh?
Is this all you could find this morning ?
I couldn't find anything !
Hey... we could eat these mushrooms.
You'd turn into a mushroom!
But...
- Mami and Kasai seem to...
- Idiot!
They're already half-mushroom!
That's alright.
If there's a way off this Island, perhaps it's the only way to live...
I shouldn't have done that.
Teacher... I can't do it!
I can't behave like you!
I can't! I can't do it!
I wish I were dead!
Akiko... we're not going to become mushrooms!
Teacher...!
We'll do it... right?
We'll spend the day... no... we'll get all the food that we can carry and get off this island!
Teacher!
Akiko!
Teacher!
Where are you? Akiko!
- Teacher!
- Akiko!
- Akiko!
- Teacher!
They're delicious! It's true!
Idiot! Let's go!
Teacher!
Then, the night came... and the morning came... and the night came again...
I don't remember when i was rescued.
But, now I'm sorry that I was.
If I was really in love with Akiko,
I should have eaten the mushrooms with her and become one.
At least we would have been together.
Isn't that it?
If I really wanted to live,
I shouldn't have been so stupid and eaten one.
With all the pain... all the suffering... all my sadness... would have disappeared by eating them!
How in the world can i face myself?!
No, no. You should consider yourself fortunate.
You were found and brought home.
Is that so?
Tokyo is not very different from that island.
People in the city are just as cruel, aren't they?
It's all the same.
I would have been happier on the island.
Transcript/Timing : aRKhaNe
I am Criswell!
For years I have told the almost unbelievable, related the unreal, and shown it to be more than a fact.
Now I tell a tale of the threshold, people, so astounding that some of you may faint.
This is a story of those in the twilight time, once human, now monsters, in a void between the living and the dead.
Monsters to be pitied, monsters to be despised.
A night with the ghouls, the ghouls reborn, from the innermost depths of the world.
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.
Let's turn back.
No, it's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
You wouldn't understand.
Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
But there's so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Sure there are, and
I've tried them all; plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.
Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
But horror stories, why all the time horror stories?
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
My monsters have done well for me.
You think I'd give that up just so I could write about trees, or dogs, or daisies?
(chuckles) Daisies.
That's it, I'll write about my creatures who are pushing up the daisies.
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
That's life, my kisses are alive.
Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
All of my books and stories are based on fact, or legend.
That's perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're gonna find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.
I can't see a thing.
Let's turn back.
There's an old cemetery on this road.
I've been there before.
I'm getting the jitters.
Let's turn back.
Okay, just as soon as I find a place wide enough to turn around.
Not so fast.
Not so fast!
It is said on clear nights, beneath the cold light of the moon, howls a dog and a wolf, and creeping things crawl out of the slime.
It is then the ghouls feast in all their radiance.
It is on nights like this most people prefer to steer clear of, uh, burial grounds.
It is on nights like this, that the creatures are said to appear, and to walk!
The day is gone, the night is upon us, and the moon, which controls all of the underworld, once again shines in radiant contentment.
Come forth, come forth, oh Princess of Darkness.
Time seems to stand still.
Not so the ghouls, when a night of pleasure is at hand!
If I am not pleased by tonight's entertainment,
I shall banish their souls to everlasting damnation!
And who is to be first?
One who loved flames.
Her lovers were killed by flames.
She died in flames.
(drum banging and crickets chirping)
One who prowls the lonely streets at night in life is bound to prowl them in eternity.
[Criswell] Ahh, the curiosity of youth, on the road to ruin.
May it ever be so adventurous.
I'm so frightened.
Well we certainly can't stay here, come on.
Where?
In there.
It frightens me.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Then, then what's that music?
That's what I wanna find out.
We have to get help.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
Well, something's making that music.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
All right, don't worry,
I'll be right beside you.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Not dead, in a cemetery?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.
They'll have a telephone.
Come on.
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.
Nothing alive looks like that.
Can't we get out of here?
I'm not sure.
What do you mean?
I'm not sure of myself.
It's just a feeling I've had since the crash, like, like I feel a cold chill all over.
Now this.
I would see for approval, the one who in life worshiped gold above all else.
- Look!
- Be careful, they'll see you.
Throw gold at her.
More gold.
More gold!
More gold!
For all eternity, she shall have gold.
And both couldn't help but remember a line from one of Bob's stories, a sudden wind howls.
The night things are all about me, every shadow, a beckoning invitation to disaster.
I know I should think of other things, of pleasant things, but I can't.
How can I think of other things, of pleasant things, when I am in a place surrounded by shadows and objects, which can take any shape, here in the darkness, any shape my mind can conceive?
Bring 'em in!
They are live ones?
[Mummy] Yes, Master.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
[Mummy] Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
You shall both be rewarded.
My dear empress of the night, put these intruders to the test.
But they are not yet one of us.
A situation easily remedied.
'Fe them that they may watch.
Fiend, fiend!
To love the cat, is to be the cat.
(Playful music and whip snapping)
A pussycat is born to be whipped.
It will please me very much to see the slave girl with her tortures!
(whip snapping and woman groaning)
Torture, torture, it pleasures me!
Torture, torture, it pleasures me!
Torture, torture, it pleasures me!
I'm so frightened.
You've got a right to be.
We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
Those creatures!
Don't let them hear you.
What can we do?
I don't know.
I just don't know, but don't give up.
We're not finished yet.
Easy Shirley, easy!
Panic won't do us any good!
Let me think.
We've got to stall for time.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
Whatever you do, don't do that.
Hold!
Let her continue to learn.
The time is not yet right that they should join with us.
And what is this?
A symbol, Master.
What kind of symbol?
She loved the bull ring and the matador.
She danced to their destruction.
Now she dances to her own destruction.
Her dance is of skulls.
She came to us on the day of the dead.
El dia de los muertos, a celebration in her country.
Her dance has pleased me.
With the loss of her lover, this one cast herself into the volcano's fire.
She was?
As I said, a worshiper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
It would seem so, Master.
[Mummy] I don't like snakes.
I remember the one
Cleopatra used.
Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.
You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
[Wolfman] Argh, hurt her?
[Mummy] Hell it killed her!
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt, slimy, slinky things.
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
She pleases me.
Permit her to live in the world of the snakes.
Now, I will talk to the
Wolfman and the Mummy.
As you wish, Master.
[Mummy] He wants us.
Ah, what do you suppose for?
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
Uh-uhn
[Mummy] I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
Come!
[Mummy] We better go before we make him mad.
We are your servants, Master.
Of course you are.
[Mummy] Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
[Criswell] You know better than that.
We don't know of anything, Master.
[Criswell] Then why do you shake so?
It's not often an emperor like you calls on creatures like us.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Ah, then it is some service you desire of us.
You are the keepers of the damned.
You two know them all, and I am tired of this usual type of entertainment.
I want a decided change.
The moon, is soon gone!
There is little time left for the remainder of the evening's pleasures.
Yes, yes, yes I know all that.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgment until after the next full moon.
It would seem so, Master.
Ah, but I declare there is still time for something.
[Mummy] There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master.
Ah, good.
Then I will see them, dismiss the rest.
[Mummy] Yes, sir, Master.
The ropes are coming loose.
[Shirley] Be careful!
I am, it's our only chance.
Nothing is worth your life.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
I'm frightened,
I'm so frightened.
[Bob] Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
Be careful, oh please be careful.
We'll never get out of here alive,
I know it, I just feel it.
You do?
Yes I feel it in my bones.
You're talking nonsense.
Oh, no I'm not.
These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave.
Or would they?
[Shirley] I should hope not, I hate you!
That sudden?
[Shirley] Yes, that sudden.
If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.
It's all your fault.
And I thought you loved me.
Not yet, I perhaps have other plans for such a pretty one.
No matter, I will tell you when and if you may have her.
The Wolfman informs me that the next one is the woman who murdered her husband on their wedding night.
Now she dances with his skeleton.
Have you not enjoyed the evening's festivities?
Ah, that will soon change when you become one of us.
It would seem that the Wolfman would have you for his own.
I have promised both the Wolfman and the Mummy a reward.
It could be that you are that reward.
You need not worry, not just now anyway.
Leave her alone, you fiend!
Fiend is it!
You will not be so fortunate.
Your existence will cease within moments.
No one wishes to see a man dance.
And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
If I could get my hands on you!
Oh, you could do nothing!
I can save you much pain.
Leave her alone, I tell you!
[Criswell] I do not joke in my proposals.
She is to be mine, it is so spoken!
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.
Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient.
I have but to touch you with my finger and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly.
No, no, no!
I repulse you?
Very well, it seems you have chosen your own fate.
Live with it, I should say die with it!
I've got the ropes loose now.
I've got my hands free.
Be careful, don't change your expression too much.
They must not catch on.
What can we do against them?
I don't know, yet.
We'll just have to watch our chance.
When it comes, I'll know what to do.
I hope I'll know what to do.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
All right, put it on heavy.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.
At least he's got brains.
Him!
I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
Maybe so.
[Mummy] I could make her another Cleopatra.
[Wolfman] Argh ha ha!
[Mummy] Without the snake, of course.
- Well?
- Ah, she will be yours.
- When?
- At your discretion, but first, I desire more entertainment.
The moon is almost gone!
Ah, there is yet time.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light.
I know the laws of the night.
I state there is still time for yet another.
I would have time for my own pleasures!
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it.
I am the sole ruler of the dark world.
There is no one to challenge my authority here.
My word is the law, all powerful.
No one is to challenge that authority, no one!
Is that understood?
It is my command.
I understand, Master.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of everlasting despair.
Now are there others?
There are others.
Well then let us proceed.
[Princess] She lived as a zombie in life, so she will remain forever a zombie in death.
Easy, Shirley, easy!
The moon sinks lower into the hills!
We must hurry to the finish.
I will decide the conclusion.
You had the Mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
Then cancel my order.
The moon is almost gone!
There is yet time.
Don't you want your own pleasure?
Oh, if there is only time!
Ah, there is always time!
All in good time, there is always time.
You shall have your pleasures, that I decree!
All others were but infinitesimal bits of fluff, compared to her.
This one would have died for feathers, furs, and fluff, and so she did.
- The time, is short.
- For what?
Your pleasures of course!
- You mean?
- You may take her now.
Is there time?
You better hope there is.
Thank you, Master, thank you!
Now hurry, hurry,
I will watch!
Your desires may be my pleasure also, our fitting climax to an evening's entertainment.
You must hurry now.
Easy, Miss, everything's gonna be all right.
Bob, Bob?
He's right here beside you, he'll be all right too.
Where are they, where did they go?
They tried to kill me.
What's this you say?
Who was going to kill you?
The ghouls, they all turned into skeletons.
Take it easy, Miss.
What she needs is a good rest.
It's true, I tell you, it's true!
They all turned into skeletons.
She, she cut me here.
Probably was bruised in the crash.
You know, you two were very lucky.
I love you Bob, I really do.
Forgive me?
There's nothing to forgive, it was all a dream.
You love me then?
Of course I do.
Quick, quickly.
Easy does it, careful.
That's pretty bad there, sure enough.
As it is with all the night people, they are destroyed by the first rays of the sun, but upon the first appearance of the deep shadows of the night, and when the moon is full, they will return to rejoice in their evil lust, and take back with them any mortal who might happen along.
Yes, they were lucky, those two young people.
May you be so lucky.
But do not trust to luck at the full of the moon.
When the night is dark, make a wide path around the unholy grounds, of the night people.
Who can say that we do not exist, can you?
But now, we return to our graves, and you may join us soon!

JULIET OF THE SPIRITS
- The candles, signora?
- No, she'll do it.
Right. I'll light them.
Is it the red?
I like the blond one better.
Teresina, I can decide myself.
Sorry, signora.
I love the blond one.
But this one suits you, too.
- What shoes, signora?
- I'm wearing them, Teresina!
I really wanted to give you a present, but I sent my money home.
Never mind. Next time.
This one looks really pretty on you.
It doesn't! I look awful.
I won't wear any.
I'm sick of this dress!
Throw it out.
This thing too!
Here, you can have it.
Signora, do you know what you're getting for your anniversary?
Your gift for him is so beautiful.
Signora, your husband's here!
Get off the bed, you!
Hurry, he's in the garden!
Let me try it.
Teresina, quick, my dress!
You know, signora,
I feel so excited.
How beautiful!
Is the other room all set?
- Is it all right?
- Light the candles.
His gift is under his napkin.
You've only one earring on!
I left it in the bathroom.
Get it, please.
Turn off the lights.
What's the matter?
The power's out?
What's happening?
What are you all doing there?
You're right! I'm so sorry.
It's so beastly of me!
To think I even wrote it down.
But I have a surprise, too.
Welcome, everyone!
It's our wedding anniversary.
Juliet, look who's here!
Happy anniversary!
It's their anniversary. Look.
- Lights!
- Look what your friend Val broughtyou.
Thanks. What is it?
It's a charm against spirits!
You must hang it here.
- Hi,Juliet.
- Let me look at you!
It's been 15 years, my friends!
That dog's been so nervous for the past two or three days. Down!
That's Genius, the greatest clairvoyant on earth.
I know everything about you.
You're an Aquarius, right?
Lots of famous people are.
- Always a pleasure to see you!
- Don't be bothersome!
Astrology is a fascinating science!
Say, girls! What's cooking?
Juliet, make us something.
- Well, what?
- Anything.
They've made up.
He opens his mouth and I get angry. It's so stupid!
I'll cook! I'll make my famous pilafa la Dolores!
Have you got any paprika?
- Red pepper.
- Even better.
- Let me help.
No, it's a secret recipe!
Sculpting, cooking and making love: my three vocations!
Have you found your conquering angel?
I saw you at Vigor, the gym.
Never been there.
I did some body building too.
Let's see.
Romolo, pick me up.
What's up, handsome?
It's all here in the cards, see.
Right? You're so mysterious not even my cards can read you.
- And now, signora?
- Do we have to feed them all?
Sure, they're our guests.
Where's Juliet? Can I go?
Don't be silly and start crying.
Genius, come feel Juliet's vibes!
You look like a doll tonight!
I've got so much to tell you.
Dear counselor, your sister's doubts are no mystery.
The Indians already knew everything, like the Egyptians, the Etruscans and the Chinese.
Right, last night I dreamt--
I'm sorry.
This is not the right time.
Another time, Val.
Sit down.
He'll do the pendulum.
Clear your mind of all thoughts.
Take off my jacket.
Yes, maestro.
Things are taking a good turn!
A strong magnetic charge!
This house-- who lived here before you?
The charge's positive, see?
It's moving clockwise.
- Who's there?
- Me!
It's not a good time.
- What's up?
- Nothing!
Are you bad-mouthing me?
What's up?
Don't just walk in. It's a shock!
Sorry for bringing so many people,
They dropped by.
What could I do?
It's fine.
They're all very nice.
Giorgio.
Do you love me?
Good luck to you both!
To the bride and groom!
- Are you married?
- Would I cheer if I were?
Lying is much more heroic.
We'll give you a gold medal, then.
Does the lady know she's living with a hero?
Sit around the table.
Don't cross your legs.
I'll purify the air.
Cutie...
No cats!
They attract restless souls!
Quiet!
Take your seance and--
You two can go to bed now.
She said she wouldn't do it anymore, it scares me so.
Go, go ahead!
I feel many presences!
They've already gathered.
I'm sorry, it's the incense.
Focus.
Create your inner void.
I feel a new presence.
Somebody who's never been here is trying to communicate.
How's the charge, maestro?
Tell it to fill my bottle.
It's empty.
One...
Don't breathe.
Two...
A longer step, longer. One...
Here it is!
Speak to it, maestro.
Spirit, do you wish to be known?
It said ''I''...
...''R''...
- ...''H''...
- ...''I''...
- Didn't it say ''H''?
- Shut up. It said ''I''.
''S''... Iris. It's a woman.
Iris! Such a pretty name!
I wonder who she was.
Could you tell us who you are?
She said she's gorgeous.
Right, maestro?
Yes, she did.
Iris, listen. Are you here with a message for us?
She said: ''Love for everybody.''
What a sweet message!
Listen Iris, could you tell us--
What is it?
- Interference, perhaps.
Are you still there, Iris?
It said: ''No.''
Let's listen.
Who are you?
Olaf.
He said his name is Olaf.
You're Turkish, am I right?
He said you are Turkish.
Send a message for each of us.
To help us through this life.
What can you tell our friend?
- ''Whore.''
- No, you've misunderstood me.
Trollop. He says, ''Big Trollop.''
It isn't really an insult.
- What was that?
- He said ''Big Trollop''!
Poor soul, rest in peace.
Professor, send him on his way.
Who's this?
They hung up.
A message for you,Juliet.
Who do you think you are?
You're nothing.
You don't mean a thing to anybody.
You're a derelict!
Hold it!
Don't break the chain.
- What's happening?
- Who's feeling ill?
Switch the light on, now!
Adults playing such games!
It was an other worldly message.
Olaf, leave now!
Yes, I understand. Ciao.
I'm here, silly!
You gave us such a fright!
Still, this lady is very gifted.
Very, very gifted.
Elisabetta!
Has my husband left?
He just left, signora.
He didn't want to wake you, because you were up so late.
He won't be home for dinner.
Then Anny took your nieces to the beach.
The pond needed some cleaning.
The leaves stop up the drains.
Bravo, Gasperino.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
I'd like to fly into the arms
The arms of my beauty
- Go away. Shall I get the plumber?
- Yes, fine.
He's from my village.
The water tank is still very noisy.
''For everybody.''
''Love for everybody.''
I'll set the table right away.
Iris?
Have you ever heard radio transmissions on a plane?
The ether is full of voices giving orders.
Human voices, voices full of phlegm.
Such naivete is offensive to reason.
They're electric fields, unidentified substances.
What about communications from other planets?
- You, be quiet!
- Let me speak.
I read in Reader's Digest--
I'd advise you against these experiments.
As a child, I'd just shut my eyes, and I would see--
I would close my eyes and see balls!
In beautiful colors!
Good for you!
Castles, nocturnal plants, forests and little tiny faces.
They stared at me with sparkling eyes.
I was afraid.
Still, it was beautiful.
It went on for years, and then, nothing.
I just had to close my eyes--
What if I told you it was just indigestion?
When we die, we're a pile of bones.
We hope the cat won't get us.
Take a swim, buy a horse,jump obstacles.
But above all, tell your husband to make love more often.
Nothing's better for tooth aches and spirits.
Yes, I know.
There's a real vision!
The kind of vision even I believe in.
Raffaello, sit down. Please!
I'd like them day and night.
She's our neighbor, but we're not really acquainted.
Ildegarda!
You may not be acquainted, but I'd love to be.
Mademoiselle, go fetch the girls, please.
Rossella, Sabrina!
What are you doing there?
Don't disturb the lady or she'll get angry.
- What about me?
- Thank her.
Let's go, girls.
I'm going for a swim, ma'am.
Our dear Juliet sees magic everywhere.
'A happy life reigned in Catherine's home.
Her husband adored her, her children were growing up strong and hard-working.
Naturally, the men in the village set her as an example for their wives.
The women began dreading her, like smoke in their eyes. ''
Juliet, please help me.
I'm old.
Besides, it concerns you.
Dottore,
Dottore, help me!
Juliet, the lady over there sent us this fruit basket.
Wasn't that nice?
Juliet.
- Did you say something, madame?
- No.
I didn't say a thing.
Stop running. Come here.
There was a headless fish in the sea.
Auntie said if we return it to the sea, the head would grow back.
- Did you swim?
Aunt Sylva, we saw a fish without a head!
Hold still, don't touch!
You are filthy.
Ciao. I wonder when I can get a house here, too.
You're so pale!
The little one is pale all over.
Did she get any sun?
Remember what the doctor ordered?
At least two hours of sun each day.
With our heads reclining
We lose ourselves in a sad flight in destiny's breath
That blows through our hair
Ciao, Sylva.
What a surprise.
Adele was getting the girls.
We came with Mother.
You're running around in this heat?
We were going home.
The heat isn't bad.
- Don't. You're perspiring.
- Staying for lunch?
No. Rehearsal's at 3:00 at the studio.
It's 2:00 already.
We're late.
When do we meet Luciana?
At 4:00. Then it's the dressmaker.
Did they bother you?
No, they were good company.
We had fun together.
You look good, Sylva.
I lost four pounds.
The director wanted me thinner.
How's the night life?
Well, there isn't much to do.
I'm usually tired, so we prefer staying in.
Your husband is shameless.
He invited me to dinner to impress his guests from Venezuela.
I said I'd come with my boyfriend.
And he says, ''Well, next time, then.''
What gives?
Is he ever home?
He comes in at night after work.
Careful. He'll get burned out.
But he said we'll take a nice holiday.
We'll go on a cruise.
Spain, Greece-- he hasn't decided.
I have the brochures.
- Really?
- We're really going.
Remember to watch TV
Saturday night.
I have a great part!
See you Sunday.
Ciao, Mother. What is it?
Nothing,just looking at you.
Why don't you put on some makeup, some lipstick?
You're right, but we were at the beach.
Take better care of yourself.
Repeat this movement...
Signora, look at Elisabetta.
Not the head,just the eyes.
Wait a second.
Like this.
Keep going, faster.
Giveit 15 days and your eyes will sparkle again like two gems.
- Set up a tray by the TV.
- No, I'm not hungry.
What a tough day!
What's this program?
- Not even a slice ofcake?
- No, nothing. I had something at the office.
Sit down here for a while.
...always needs a pretty voice and perfect diction.
A good exercise.
- Are you tired?
- Yes, a little.
Try to pronounce the following words..
From now on, talk to me this way.
Pineapple, Domodossola...
...exemption and success!
This exercise has been successful for some of the best actresses.
I was at the beach today.
And now the horoscope...
And?
I told the doctor about last night.
He made fun of me and I--
What?
Never mind.
Ladies and gentlemen, good night.
Tomorrow, my dear, is going to be busy again.
Elisabetta, call me at 7:00.
Have the car ready by 7:30.
Gabriella...
What did you say, darling?
Who's Gabriella?
Tell me, who is Gabriella?
Good morning.
Sleep well?
Don't smoke first thing in the morning.
After two days, I'm finally meeting with the Brazilians.
- What are you doing?
- I'm putting it out for you.
Ciao, little star.
You look great.
My back is killing me.
Who is Gabriella?
- What?
- Yes, Gabriella!
I don't know.
Who is she?
You said ''Gabriella'' twice in your sleep.
Really?
The book I was looking for.
You could've put it back.
You must have been dreaming.
Who is she?
Do I happen to know her?
Who? I don't know any Gabriella.
You misunderstood.
Bye, darling. I'll be back early.
I'll call you.
Going to the seashore?
Go to hell!
I'm sorry.
Somebody's been calling and hanging up three or four times a day.
- What?
- Nothing.
When he returns from Venezuela, repentant, she says:
''So, you're back now?''
Gabriella.
I heard it allright.
He said Gabriella.
Still, he looked so innocent.
True, he likes women.
Am I right, signora?
One has to put up with it.
You can't force others to do what you want.
No, darling.
I believe what they tell me.
If they say ''yes,'' it can't mean ''no,'' then ''yes,'' then ''I don't know.''
Right, signora?
One should not be proud.
Still, once he told me..
I will never lie to you. Never.
Your little house is a dream by day.
Watch the dog.
There are cats everywhere.
Enchanting!
Such an intoxicating perfume!
Look at the dew.
This is dew, isn't it?
Such purity.
My heart aches, it's all so beautiful.
I want to roll around naked in it.
Why don'tyou?
I can't. We've become so complicated, so uncivilized.
Ciao, stellina.
What are you doing?
It's wet here, though.
Is the humidity bad for your rheumatism?
Down, down.
No, dear, don't get up.
Sit here, Valentina.
Move the peppers.
What are you doing?
Storing peppers for winter.
In a wreath?
Oh, a wreath of peppers!
Such a good little house wife!
I am totally useless.
I'm so ashamed!
Why am I this way, eh?
I feel so uprooted, so adrift.
Peppers are a tiny thing, yet if I could do it, it might save me.
Let's go, Teresina.
Nobody thought of lunch today.
Will you stay with me, Val?
Wake up, Teresina.
It's almost noon!
What? Noon?
I'm supposed to meet
Ranieri at 11:00!
We have such fights if I'm late!
Dear, I'm off, but I'll see you at 5:00 p.m.
At 5:00 p.m.? Where?
Didn't I tell you?
That's why I came.
You must join us.
You can't say no.
You must be there.
But where?
Bishma! Bishma is going to be at the Plaza at 5:00!
He only comes to Europe once every seven years!
In the US he has disciples, schools, clubs, it's an event.
- Really?
- Hold still.
It's unique.
You know his experiments?
- Never heard of them.
- Where've you been?
He's a fabulous clairvoyant.
A man-woman with the secrets of both sexes!
An oracle.
He can change your life, reveal all.
- He's an Indian?
- Indian, Tibetan-- who cares?
Bishma belongs to the world!
Bye, darling.
It's meant to be.
Don't miss the meeting!
He's here just for you.
I can't go.
I don't want to miss Giorgio's call.
- You'll regret it,Juliet.
- Don't wait for me.
The electricity's out.
Bishma's apartment?
The meeting's on the terrace.
Show the ladies the way.
The elevator's broken.
Let's forget about it.
Are there lots of people?
Has it started already?
I don't know.
Let's go.
Got your questions ready?
Questions? What questions?
I'm not asking any.
When I was little, my dad told me this hotel was for--
- Elena!
- I was dreading this dark.
Hello, my angel.
- It has all come to pass.
- Ofcourse!
That same night,
I dreamt of him.
No robe, though.
What does it mean?
Love thy wife as thyself.
Those who love their wives love themselves.
Love one another for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health.
What are you staring at?
There's a wedding banquet going on.
How nice!
Love!
That's the second step.
It isn't real enlightenment, though.
So, what is this?
The single spirit.
The fruit is only appearance.
The real Buddha is beyond such differences. Is that right?
That's the third step.
Now, though, the truth is close and far away at once..
So what is this?
Isn't it an apple?
Darling, you don't get it.
Look beyond appearances.
The voice of the master will tell us what it is.
It's an apple, a humble apple, a little red and crushed on one side but at the same time it is the Buddha and unity.
Things become things again, and the enlightened being sees multiplicity and unity all at once, appearance and substance.
Is there a heaven and hell?
- Who are you?
-An American painter.
Let me see.
Cut my head off.
Go on, cut off her head.
It's one of the fables of the great master Lao Tse.
Don't hesitate.
Cut it off.
Behold the gates of hell opening!
And now the gates of heaven.
What's happening?
He's conversing with his god.
The lady called Juliet may enter.
But on her own.
How is he? Where is he?
He wants me, alone.
Go away!
But I brought you!
- But he wants me.
- Tell me where he is.
Well, the bathroom maybe.
Wait outside.
We've got an appointment.
Juliet, do you know the Kama Sutra?
Sexual intercourse is a conflict.
To be happy, you must behave as if in combat.
The place to be fought over is the body.
The body?
And within the body, the shoulders and between the breasts.
The sound that must be produced to procure pleasure is the ''Hin.''
The great sigh.
The sound ''put.''
The sound ''fut.''
And the sound ''plat.''
You might add sounds such as those produced by pigeons, ducks, green sparrows, flamingos, quail, and storks.
Sounds that can be used depending on the occasion.
Different kinds of bites.
The blind bite, the breathy bite, the point, the coral jewel line, the torn cloud, the wolf bite.
Love is a religion,Juliet.
Your husband is your god.
You are the priestess of this cult.
Your spirit must burn up like this incense, go up in smoke, on the altar of your loving body.
Now, if you have any questions, the master will gladly answer.
Well, no, nothing.
Here's what's happening.
It's as if everything's been lost since last night.
I'm afraid my husband has another woman.
Learn to better please your husband.
I do please him.
Do you remember me?
I was born this way, donna d'amore.
Am I not beautiful?
Answer honestly, am I not beautiful?
- Yes, very beautiful.
- I think so, too.
Did you see my hair?
I never comb it,
I simply caress it.
I love caressing it.
My skin is so white.
IfI am in a bad mood,
I go to the mirror.
I turn and look at my back and I immediately feel happy again.
Did you buy those stockings?
- No. What stockings?
The black fishnets.
Women want to be treated like angels, but they don't do their job--
- Is love a ''job''?
- I didn't say ''job.''
- I said ''the art of love.''
- I got it right. You said ''job.''
Whoring-- some advice!
Who are you?
Olaf, go away!
Become beautiful, like me!
Female sensibility...
I want to kiss you.
Bite my breast.
More, more!
Please, stop!
I want to leave.
Let me out.
- Calm down, signora.
- I want to leave.
We shouldn't appeal to our inner forces without the necessary preparation.
It could be dangerous.
But these spirits are generous, gentle and mild, though at times they might seem teasing.
Were your omens good?
- Yes, thank you.
- Happy?
Yes, thanks.
Good luck.
What did he tell you?
We heard--
There's another message:
Something new will come to pass tonight, new and very beautiful.
Sangria, it quenches the thirst of those who drink it.
It quenches our secret thirsts too.
They call it the potion of oblivion.
Strange.
That wasn't his voice.
A soul speaking through him.
Did you hear that?
An extraordinary meeting!
They told her she'd have an extraordinary meeting tonight.
Aren't you happy?
- Did you see her?
- I thought so.
- Did she say, ''This is Iris''?
- No, but I felt it was her.
It felt like the night of our session.
Strange.
Who do you think it was?
Maybe the dancer that ran away with my granddad.
A dancer and your granddad?
He was a professor and he fell for a dancer.
What a beautiful child!
What's your name?
Tell her,Juliet!
See how brave this beauty is.
Such an act!
I wanted to express my admiration.
A beautiful lady makes me more pious.
Idon't know why, but I liked thinking they ran away on that circus plane.
Professor, stop it in the name of God!
Come down at once.
That's an order.
You'll be accountable for this despicable behavior.
Professor De Filippis!
The headmaster had him expelled.
He vanished for two years.
Then he came back as happy as ever.
Mother didn't allow him to stay with us.
I saw him at Christmas and always in secret.
He told funny stories.
I was a little scared, too.
The bishop said he was one of the devil's disciples.
I was still a child at his funeral.
Mother didn't shed a tear.
She wore a beautiful black dress.
- She's a beauty.
- Yes, she is.
One night I saw her in the corridor.
She looked like a queen.
Perhaps she was going to a ball with my father.
Rosa Aurata.
A name like poetry.
I used to grow them, too.
My garden in Cordoba was famous.
You're very lucky.
Flowers are grateful when loved.
These plants get lots oflove.
It shows.
You must be a very loving person to give so much every day.
Is this right, sir?
Is this the one you wanted?
Yes, thank you.
Three slices of lemon, three of orange, mineral water.
A glass, please.
Not a champagne glass.
An ordinary one.
Teresina, get a large glass.
Three tea spoons of sugar.
How about this, signora?
Will this do?
In Valencia they like to add a clove, in Cordoba, a more delicate taste.
Tell me if you like it.
Delicious. What's it called?
Sangria.
It quenches the thirst of those who drink it.
It quenches our secret thirsts too.
They call it the potion of oblivion.
...stay at least a week.
Have you already met?
I told you about Jose, remember?
I was his guest in Spain.
- When?
Last year, in Castilla.
A fabulous palace!
And his paintings!
Were they by Goya or Velazquez?
Neither. Rivera.
Beautiful.
He wanted to go to a hotel.
Where can you find this peace, this quiet?
What matters is the fluidity of the movements.
The balance.
A good toreador must have a pure heart and clear thoughts, like monks or dancers.
Jose owns one ofthe biggest bull farms.
Sometimes, at night, this madman puts on his own bullfight.
What courage!
Isn't it dangerous?
No. It's poetry.
Poetry's never dangerous.
My best friends are toreadors.
They compose music, write verse, and abhor blood.
Cordoba's style in the arena is pure harmony.
May I?
Please, wait.
I have something more suitable.
How's this for a muleta ?
There's the bull.
He dies in his chimera.
He is not killed by the sword but by the magic of an elegant illusion.
The beast falls into space and I kill it with thrusts of illusion.
Miss one step, one measure, like a rhyme in poetry, and you're faced with mortal danger.
A calculated spontaneity, a pure sentiment, a clear mind, an exact gesture, and the monster will be defeated.
I want you to see Jose's present.
I'll get it. It's magnifiicent.
''No one understood the perfume of the dark magnolia of your womb.
No one knew you tormented a hummingbird of love between your teeth.''
You love Lorca's poetry, right?
Destiny plays some strange games.
I was in Madrid and I didn't want to leave because of a foreboding.
Now I am happy to be here.
There's nothing to life ifyou take away nights like this one.
I owe you a happy moment and hope it won't be the last.
For so little?
It can be everything.
Yes, a sudden decision, meeting an old friend by the sea, and feeling a lost sense of peace.
Everything becomes clear, plausible.
Juliet, what is it? Come here.
Isn't this a great gift?
It's a magic telescope!
Last year there was a scandal at their villa.
She organizes these parties.
The police were called in.
They wanted to deport her.
There are some fascinating stories about them.
She's really beautiful.
Going to bed already?
I wanted to chat.
- Did you say something?
- It doesn't matter.
- Good night, darling.
- I'm going to read for a while.
I also changed the color of the interior.
Now it's red and the seats brown.
Do you like it?
I told them..
''Boys, it's for a goddess. ''
Sure I didn't wake you?
What were you doing?
About me?
And what were you thinking?
Good night, little monster.
I'll wake you.
I forgot to get my wake-up call.
Lucky I remembered.
Who were you calling?
I told you. The phone company, to wake me up.
Want some?
Let's go back to bed.
Who were you calling?
What is it? Come on.
- What now?
- Let's come back some other time, Adele.
Or you go on your own.
I am not used to looking ridiculous.
- To have him followed, like a thief--
- But he is.
He stole your youth, your peace, your trust. He's the worst kind of thief.
But someone spying on what's going on feels like a threesome.
Isn't it a threesome already?
You must have faith.
Trust them as you would your confessor.
They take care of all the rest.
I apologize for my disguise, one of the transformations vital to the job.
I'm here to help my fellow man when he's in need of information, but are you sure you won't regret it?
There's still time.
Stop and reconsider.
I always recommend a little trip with your spouse, a second honeymoon.
Think about the tender memories in your old age.
Two white heads on the same pillow.
Time wears out suspicion and tomorrow you might be laughing at your fears of today.
At our own sufferings?
Impossible.
My sister must know the truth.
You're right.
I'm at your service.
What does this gentleman do?
He gets people together,
I don't know--
I never understood exactly.
A public relations man?
That's it.
He organizes openings for the fashion industry.
Do you have a photo?
For our psychologist.
Valli!
Sorry. I must ask a delicate question.
What is discussed here stays within these walls.
So, when you look at him--
Could you take off your glasses?
- My glasses?
- Yes.
Thanks. Does he blush when you look at him?
Make up excuses?
I don't think so. Well...
Does he speak a foreign language on the phone?
Sometimes, with his clients.
Do you use pet names when you're intimate?
- I don't see--
- Pardon.
Valli, come in here.
I want to have a word with you.
I don't see the relevance--
Every little thing matters, dear lady.
Even the smallest ofdetails.
You can't ignore anything.
Valli. One of my esteemed associates.
Could you give him our subject's photo?
Do I really have to leave it?
Imperative.
See?
Pardon my deplorable indiscretion, signora, but my questions aren't overyet.
What about lipstick on his hanky?
Perhaps a suspicious scent of perfume?
A scent of beauty cream, hair on his coat or-- forgive me-- little scratches on his body?
No, never!
Let's hear from our psychologist.
Looking at the photograph,
I say he's about 40, difficult personality, cold rages, a ladies' man.
Be careful, 'cause he's capable of rash gestures.
Hidden fear.
A great need for his mother.
And who doesn't need his mother?
Very well, dear lady.
From now on we will be devoted to your case.
Am I right?
- Ofcourse.
In a week, you'll know everything about your husband.
Our zoom lens makes ideas like intimacy and secrecy obsolete.
We don't know the word ''secrecy.''
We'll show you the husband you've never known.
You'll share his most secret hours.
You'll penetrate that shadowy zone you were never allowed into.
Are you really determined to know?
Woe unto those who shall tolerates in, for it makes them accomplices.
They shall burn with the sinner in eternal fire.
Take vengeance in the name of God!
I am the Lord of Justice.
Yes. I do want to know.
I have a full right to know.
I no longer know who he is, what is mine, what I am to him.
I need to know what he thinks and does.
I want to know everything!
Everything!
Have I gotten big?
You'll break the platform soon.
Do you like Nadir?
After all that trouble, my arch angel was right under my nose!
He's the doorman's son.
There might be some chocolate in the fridge. Have some.
You haven't seen my new works.
Looking at my statues isn't enough.
You must touch them. Try.
If I touch them, I shiver.
They feel alive.
Michelangelo shouted at his Moses: ''Speak!''
I'd like to shout at these powerful forms: ''Love me!''
I really would, you know.
My art is deeply spiritual.
You say no, eh?
Let's give back to God his physicality.
I was afraid ofGod.
He crushed me, terrified me.
And why?
I imagined him abstractly.
But no. He's got the most superb body ever.
In my statues he's a physical God, a perfectly shaped hero that I can desire and make my lover.
When I was a child,
I imagined God was hiding behind a big door, always closed, very dusty, in the nuns' little theater.
That year they were putting on the life of amartyr and they picked me.
Juliet, you have such innocent eyes!
You look like the saint herself.
- Did the saint see God?
- Yes.
When she flew up to heaven, consumed by the flames of martyr dom.
Juliet, swear you'll tell me?
- Yes.
- Ask Him if He loves me.
- Yes.
- Really?
Yes, Laura, I'll ask Him.
Juliet, come. You're on.
Arrest her!
Bring her before me!
Your faith is against the empire, but we are merciful and forgiving.
Do you renounce your faith?
Will you sacrifice to the emperor?
No, never!
So you prefer death.
Do you accept martyrdom?
Yes, Ido.
You've still got time, if you hold your life dear.
I don't care about the clemency you offer me, but about the salvation of my soul.
It's the emperor's orders.
Burn this Christian at the stake!
Stop!
Shame on you!
This is indecent!
I want my grand daughter now!
Do as Granddad tells you.
Get down now!
Enough, in the name of the Lord!
Snap out of it! Enough!
You snap out ofit!
I'm perfectly sane!
Putting a child on the stake!
What are we? Cannibals?
Bring that thing down here right now!
You wretches!
Kids, go home.
And you get out of my way!
This is crazy!
You go up and get roasted, if you dare show your legs!
What do you teach these creatures?
You'll make mad women out of these innocents!
Go grill each other!
Come down from there right now!
That's an order!
I'm your headmaster!
You must obey me!
Your behavior is unacceptable!
Shut up! ''Unacceptable...''
And you?
You're so quiet.
You let them do anything.
You enjoy getting fried, silly?
Did you see God? Answer me.
Did you? Answer!
Forget this shameful situation that dishonors our school.
Please, accept our heart felt apologies.
Teresina!
Where did this cat come from?
It isn't ours. I don't know.
And such evil yellow eyes.
It's from the old villa.
Don't move.
I'll catch it.
Oh, it went inside!
Gasperino, lend us a hand.
Cats and I, we don't get along.
Careful, it might scratch you.
Can we keep it?
Cats are terrible.
They scratch and bite.
- They aren't dangerous!
- Well, let's hope for the best.
- I got it!
- Chubby!
Cutie!
''Suzy.'' Your name is Suzy.
The gate's open!
Some place you have here!
Excuse me, signora.
Health and prosperity.
And may God make you each day more beautiful for His glory!
Tell us the convent story again.
- No.
- Come here a moment.
- Am I good?
- Good?
You're an angel.
See you tomorrow.
Mother, can you take Alyosha?
I need to talk.
- Yes, you're naughty.
- No, professor!
You see? He comes here three or four times a day!
A very nice boy, but what a mistake falling for my daughter!
And my daughter, well, she's--
Alyosha, go look at yourself in the mirror.
This young man's beauty is inside.
You can't see it.
But women are seduced by outer splendor.
And you, you don't have any visible charm!
Nice cat!
Just a second!
You vagrant!
He was in my garden.
But now he's back.
How kind of you!
He's so beautiful he might get stolen.
He's so beautiful he might get stolen.
Hear that, silly?
You shut up!
Ildegarda! Take him!
Where were you?
Did you thank Signora--
-Juliet.
- A beautiful name!
I'm Suzy. Was he bad?
No, he was very good.
Good? He's a drunkard.
He loves champagne.
Oh, the guy on the phone!
Are you there?
A lady from next door brought the cat back.
Sure, all my friends are beautiful.
Perhaps...
He's so over bearing! Sorry.
- Don't mind me.
Stay. It was time we met.
I don't want to be in your way.
- A little champagne?
- Thank you.
Nothing for you.
Stay for lunch!
- I really can't.
We'll get rid of everybody and I'll cook.
I can't open this.
I like you all sweaty like that.
Don't worry.
I don't want a thing from you.
Tomorrow you must--
- I'll tell Suzy what you've done.
It's a tribal secret.
Signora, your glasses.
Here's the champagne!
Great! Paolo, come here.
Just a little for you, right?
You get really crazy when you drink.
Forgive this mess.
I'm remodeling, because I'd like more color.
Would you like a tour?
- Sure.
- Come on.
How lucky!
You can give me a few good tips.
Welcome,Juliet!
I had a dream about you.
In a church.
You sat at the professor's desk.
I sat in the last row, dressed like a nun.
You said,
''Let me see how you walk.''
I walked like this and you flunked me.
I woke up crying.
Join us at my party this Saturday.
Bring your husband, of course.
I see you from my window.
You two must be truly in love.
I'd love to love one man that way.
But how?
My granny.
She hasn't slept in five years.
She sits here and sees all, knows all.
Granny, this is Juliet.
Do you like her?
What's wrong, my dear?
I get spooked.
She's a bit ofa witch, too.
She sees people and knows their secrets.
Everything passes.
- Hello, beautiful.
- How is she?
Better, but I heard wailing all night long.
Excuse me a moment.
Arlette? It's me.
Arlette, please.
- Welcome.
-Juliet, come here!
My lady has a very big heart.
You haven't touched your food again.
Know what I'll do?
I'll call Mrs. Artemia now.
She'll set you right.
Come on. Up you go.
Or I'll tell Roby to leave now!
Don't worry, Arlette.
She's a friend.
She loves you. Right?
Of course.
Here, have some.
Why don't you believe we all love you?
I'll come back to see you later.
What did she do?
Tried to take her life three times.
The last time I almost lost her.
I called and called.
No answer.
We had to break down the door.
What a sight!
Unlucky in love.
Here I can keep an eye on her.
Like Laura, my schoolmate.
She drowned herself at 15.
They called it an accident.
But she killed herself for love.
- Quiet!
- Take this one with the feathers.
Why are you here?
I'm really annoyed now!
I told him,
''She's going to get angry.''
Didn't I tell you?
You mustn't come here.
Got it? You mustn't!
- Hands off my stuff!.
- He only took a slipper!
This is my home!
You obey me or go back to the streets.
You hear me?
She was a whore.
- You'd like to be a whore, too!
Yes, why not?
This trollop has some stories!
None of it true, of course.
We were just joking around.
What else can we do?
Juliet, how are you?
Iris keeps her word.
Suzy is your teacher.
Listen toher, follow her.
I shouldn't encourage your fetishism.
'Cause you are a fetishist!
Yes, Momy told me.
Keep it. It's a gift.
I don't believe fetishism's a good trait.
And for a Russian, an appalling one!
Ah, come see.
I watched you so many times in your garden.
Come,Juliet!
Look!
You have mirrors up there, too?
Do you like them?
-  Yes.
It was my idea.
Momy loves them.
Sometimes it seems there are four of us.
God, I hope you won't think badly of me.
Men have such funny fantasies, you know!
Come on in!
The water's warm!
Another one of my ideas.
After we make love, we slide down.
It's great!
Take off your clothes and come on in!
- No, thank you.
Once Momy dove down head first.
He nearly kicked the bucket.
Come on,Juliet.
Dive in!
I fulfill my desires.
I don't deny myself a thing.
Look. What's up there?
I eat, dance, play, fight!
I love fighting!
Let's sunbathe.
Up there!
Much better than the beach.
It's my very own sun.
Look. There's the switch.
- Are we going up there?
- Sure! Pull the lever down.
There's a convent in Greece on a mountain where the monks get up this way.
Send it down again.
- Do I lift the lever?
Good! Your turn now!
Ready?
- Yes!
Don't be afraid!
If your head starts spinning, close your eyes!
- Give me your hand.
- I can manage.
They can look all they want.
They'll never find us.
- Sure.
- We've lost them.
- Who?
- Those two guys in the car.
Didn't you notice?
I saw two lovers in those bushes the other day.
How they made love!
I felt like applauding, they were so good.
It looked so delicate, so festive from up here.
Is your head still spinning?
Let's have a drink.
The sun has reached its zenith.
The most beautiful hour of the day.
No shadows now.
Oh, it's full of rain.
There are two fish inside.
Sit down.
Let's undress and sunbathe naked.
I'm just fine.
Granny mixes up perfumes with wild flowers.
Try some.
Men get so drunk on it.
Once the engineer--
What d' you say about your marriage?
- Nothing.
Don't you trust me?
- Yes, but--
- So? Tell me.
Haven't you ever thought about getting married?
No, never.
See, I always thought marriage worked this way:
I was all his and he was all mine.
I'm ashamed to say it, but Giorgio was my first love.
I saw him and fell in love.
All I wanted was to be with him.
He asked me to marry him.
I couldn't believe it.
He became my whole world: husband, lover, father, friend, my home.
I didn't need anything else.
I thought it was the way it was meant to be. I was happy.
- They may be at the beach.
- Maybe they're gone.
- No, there they are!
- What are you doing?
See? They found us.
Naughty boys!
We've got something to give you!
- Do you know them?
- Never saw them before.
Tell me about your lovely wedding.
Did you know
I was to marry at 13?
Oh, I dropped my shoe!
I'm sorry, it's late.
I have to get back home.
- Areyou leaving?
- Yes.
Could you let me down?
You can come up here whenever you'd like.
- Hello. How are you?
- Please.
There.
Won't you stay with us?
I get off at the first floor.
You stay on.
''And among all of these trials was the most terrifying: the labyrinth.
The labyrinth is a great palace.
Once you've stepped in, you can't leave.
The more you wander, the more you lose your way.''
Here.
What's with you today?
A little blue, signora.
So what did the ogre do?
Could I leave early today?
Aunty!
''But the ogre, who was a true dare devil, said,
'I'll get in the labyrinth.'''
You may leave, Teresina.
''What will you give me ifI escape?''
But I don't like you leaving every day between 3:00 and 8:00.
''They walked through a wood of golden apple trees, so plentiful and so resplendent that even at night it was as bright as day.''
- Is the lady at home?
- Yes. Who's speaking?
A friend.
Just a second.
Go play outside.
Go ahead.
We'd like to see you.
Could you come thisafternoon?
Today?
I don't know if today--
Have you found something already?
We spent seven rather busy days, but I think you'll appreciate our work.
- Can'tyou tell me over the phone?
- Honestly, it's not our policy, you do realize--
- Of course.
- We'll be waiting then.
I'll do my best.
My respects, signora.
I honestly think we have some outstanding results.
Maybe we can show you what you wanted to know.
I can see your worries, but do believe me, nothing is irreparable.
Please, sit down.
If you only knew how many couples reconciled here.
A little drink?
The only way to truly love is to really know each other.
St. Augustine's words.
Today isn't a defeat.
The shots aren't always in focus, but consider the conditions my men had to work in.
Here are the first three days.
From the 23rd to the 25th.
I'll read the enclosed report.
''On the 23rd, subject left at 7:30, wearing white suit.
A car follows him from home to a florist's.''
Needless to say, we have all the data on the recipient of this floral homage.
Here she is going into a restaurant.
The hat makes positive identification impossible.
See, signora.
I suggest our clients consider all they see with a little detachment.
See, our objective point of view is limited.
Perception and reality are two different things.
This could be innocent.
Is that Lake Bracciano?
No, a field below the castles.
''On the 24th, an afternoon trip to the Appian Way.
Stopped in the fields, from 4:20 to about 6:00.''
The girl's name is Gabriella Olsi.
24 years old, a professional model.
Let's look at the slides while I change reels.
I shot these personally.
The tape recorder.
We also taped a conversation between them in a park.
My God.
That wasn'tme.
When we met you had another--
When I met you
When I met you
There was the moon
You should be flattered
I'm showing my jealousy.
It bothers me.
-Should I change?
- You're perfect.
The interpretation is up to you.
What can we say?
We're the exclusive holders of this material, to be exhibited only in court.
And only if subpoenaed.
100,000 lira for our expenses, equipment, per diems, overtime, etc.
Your invoice, signora.
And believe me, we've treated you fairly.
Our respects, dear lady, and allow us to express our wish that it all turn out for the best.
Have a good time, madam.
Here's our charming neighbor.
I knew you'd come.
How are you?
Your husband's been punished?
He's not backyet.
My husband is always late.
He works.
He works a lot.
So I came by myself.
He's got complete trust in me.
And he's completely wrong.
You've met my mother.
Best not to wake her or she'll start singing.
Masku has Maometto guiding his hand.
Momy, this is Juliet.
Thank you for honoring my house.
Know who that is?
That's Momy, my fiance.
He's 65 years old.
And he wants to make love every day.
And he does!
What's up?
You look so sad.
Sad? Me?
Not at all. I'm fine.
Actually, I feel like having fun.
Good! And I feel like hugging everybody. Here.
I want you to be happy.
Your attention, please.
This is the most intimate and secret moment.
Now Tudefonde has captured the winds, and each girl is the maid servant of purification.
An ancient Egyptian rite of passage between life and death.
I am the goddess of vice.
An hour with me might kill you, but you'll reach the heights and depths of pleasure.
This is my hour.
At 11:00 I reach the peak ofmy desire.
This is a game in Lola's honor.
We simulate the atmosphere of a brothel.
How amusing.
Then you stare into a man's eyes.
There, this one, with the big nose.
Can't such a gentleman decide?
- Is this fine?
- Great, perfect!
- I offer a week in Japan.
- Shame on you.
- Fine, two weeks.
- Tight wad!
- It's Japan!
- Don't listen.
On your knees.
- What's your name?
- Ildegarda.
- No, your name is Sex.
- Sex.
- No, your name's Womb.
- Womb.
No, your name is now the name of the goddess.
You're not yourself anymore.
You're the door, the soil, the bed of divinity.
You're very pretty.
Are you a model?
Would you know a Gabriella?
- Who?
- Gabriella Olsi.
- Sure, I know her.
- I hear she's a beauty.
- Yes.
- More than me?
She's very beautiful.
Also a slut, right?
You can tell me, you know.
It's becoming sort of a compliment.
Do I play my part well?
Lola, don't you think she's perfect?
He's my god child.
Nice, huh?
I'm up here.
Juliet, come up.
Go away!
What is it?
He's waiting.
He wants you.
The champagne.
Suzy is your teacher.
Listen to her, follow her.
I must have drunk too much.
Juliet, what are you doing?
I'm late, right?
- How are you?
- Have you seen Juliet?
No, I haven't.
Where are you going?
To your confirmation?
What are you doing?
- They're analyzing my wife.
- Oh, is the American doctor here?
Try to stay focused and remember everything.
I want to see what happens when your turn comes.
- This is very dangerous!
- I know you're afraid.
No, Giorgio, please.
In every psychodrama, each one ofus must contribute to the truth.
We must create an atmosphere of total, absolute truth.
Look, I don't think
I'm the right person!
Try to re-enact that scene.
You're reproaching your brother-in-law.
Would you like to play this lady's brother-in-law?
- The counselor is a little too old.
- I'm flattered.
Fine, let's have this young good-looking man.
It'll certainly work out better.
I'm sorry.
I was reading his palm.
I don't understand!
I want to tell you something.
Come here.
Don't tell me about the future, but about today.
Forgive me.
I won't do it again.
Signora, they're waiting foryou.
Yes, I'm coming.
Enough! Leave me alone!
Bare faced liar!
I'll never again believe a word you say.
Leave!
Out!
- Teresina, who are you talking to?
- Nobody, ma'am.
- Who were you talking to?
- Nobody.
- Who's there?
- Come on. Everybody's waiting.
Let me play this psychodrama.
There's a dark spot in my life that has left me--
Good morning, everyone.
- Sit down.
- Hello, Mother.
- Finally.
- Hello, Adele.
- Care for a drink?
- No, thanks. Not now.
Dr. Miller has proposed a new game: the psychodrama.
We reenact our anguishes, projecting them onto somebody else.
Interesting. Right?
- Yes.
I've seen certain people among your guests.
Love the kimono.
Your eyes are bloodshot.
Have you been crying?
I find these games utterly boring.
Remember not to fly on the 27th.
May we pay homage to the lady of the house? So pretty!
Of course, with such a beautiful mother...
I'll bet you it's a boy.
Don't forget I told you.
Juliet, listen.
This isn't a game.
You with that sad face, why not try? Yes?
Quiet! It's Juliet's turn!
Perhaps she doesn't feel like it.
- Yes, I do. I'm absolutely fine.
- She does, she does.
It's an amazing psychological experience. You'll feel set free.
It's like seeing oneself in a mirror.
- You get straight to your sore spot.
- Don't be afraid.
Tell us about a painful event in your life.
Try to recall here, with us, the place, the people, the circumstances.
Can you evoke the atmosphere that characterized that event?
Can you really help me?
Here they come again.
Go away!
Go away!
- What are you saying?
- Nothing. It's just a game.
- Let me have this.
- Okay.
Cut down on cigarettes.
Follow your doctor's advice.
Can't you see them?
Hear them?
''Get revenge. ''
''Forgive. ''
Who should I believe?
''Make yourself beautiful. ''
''Life is a sacrifice. ''
''Be more feminine.
We'll teach you.''
My life is full of people talking, talking!
Go away!
Get out, all of you!
Water.
When I need something absolutely pure, something sincere,
I always ask forwater.
Simple things are so important in life.
Things that don't conceal something else.
Water is like a sincere glance that conceals nothing.
Don't be afraid of the truth.
The truth sets us free.
After all, who cares about other people's opinions?
In my country there's a saying:
''I am my own roof, window and hearth.
I feed upon my words and drink from my thoughts.
Therefore I am happy.''
Are you real, yes or no?
And what advice can you give me?
Tell me, what should I do?
I wouldn't know.
I just want you to live happily.
And Giorgio? Where is he?
- Do you know what he said?
- Quiet!
I'm sorry I forgot, signora.
Your husband left early.
He didn't want to bother you while you were dancing.
He asked to be excused.
Somebody was coming in from Brazil.
He said he might not be in for dinner.
He said he'd call you, though.
Juliet, listen to me.
In an adultery suit it's now enough to bring circumstantial proof and he's done for.
I'm not speaking as your lawyer now, but as a friend who cherishes and loves you.
Is there hope for me,Juliet?
Think about it.
It's in your best interest.
I'm presuming to understand the source of your inner conflict and think that I might help you.
You're too involved with your problems.
This is your mistake.
Tall old trees are the most impressive symbol of this way of life, deeply rooted in the earth, branches stretched out into the sky, opening in all directions.
Theirs is a spontaneous growth.
This is the great yet simple mystery we must learn: to fulfill ourselves spontaneously, avoiding passions and desires.
Feel how calm it is here?
Sometimes we must speak up.
Even if it's a stranger listening.
Lie down in the grass.
Relax. Don't be afraid.
Look at the sun between the branches.
All is peaceful and quiet.
But you're not. Why?
- I don't know.
- What are you afraid of?
May I answer for you?
You're afraid of ending up alone, of being abandoned, of your husband leaving you.
But what you really want with all your heart is to be left alone and for your husband to leave.
I want Giorgio to leave me?
It's the truth.
Without Giorgio, you'd start to breathe, become yourself again.
You think you're afraid.
In truth, your only fear is to be happy again.
Signorina Gabriella Olsi.
She's not in, but she should be back soon.
Do come in.
I'm sorry, I was tidying up.
She called me around noon saying she wouldn't be back for lunch.
These days she's almost always out.
Make yourself at home.
May I offer you something?
No, thank you.
Sorry, ma'am, but I must finish packing.
The poor thing has been waiting so long for this trip with her boyfriend.
It was all set, but he cancelled at the last minute.
I don't mean to be critical.
He's a good man.
I've never seen anybody so in love with Miss Gabriella.
She deserves it, too.
I shouldn't be saying this,
'cause we're relatives, but they make such a pretty pair.
He says he really feels at home here.
He handpicked the furniture.
All very tasteful.
Yes, I'm packing.
There's a lady here, waiting.
I don't know her.
Shall I put her on?
Would you like to talk to her?
It's Miss Gabriella.
Yes, I'd love to.
Just a second.
There's a phone right behind you.
- Hello? Who's speaking?
- This is Giorgio's wife.
Nice to meet you, signora.
Did we have an appointment?
No, I'd like to talk to you.
What can I do foryou?
Can't you tell me over the phone?
I can wait.
I'm not in any hurry.
I don't think it would be good for you.
My afternoon is full and I'll be back late.
- Are you afraid?
- Afraid? No.
Still, I don't enjoy other people's defeat, and we don't have anything to say to each other.
Good night, signora.
Good luck.
I'm not leaving.
Signora, I have to leave.
And Miss Gabriella won't be in till late.
I'm sorry, but--
I'm cooking for your husband.
He's leaving.
- Our happiness...
- The bags go in the car.
...has only one name.
I'm off to Milan.
I'm just having a snack.
- I'll make it.
- Teresina's already taking care of it.
Did you salt it?
And what's the side dish?
A little salad.
It's ready, sir.
Is the trunk open?
I'll load it, then.
First time you packed yourself.
Sure you didn't forget anything?
I don't think so.
Will you be away long?
A couple of days, maybe.
I'll call you.
Should I shut the windows?
May I go out for a while, signora?
Listen, I may stay a bit longer.
I haven't been feeling well.
I saw a doctor.
I didn't tell you, but--
Would you like some fruit?
Perhaps the job has been wearing me out lately.
The doctor says I'm fine but that I should rest, and, frankly,
I need a little time by myself.
Finally! Nice meeting you.
We heard a lot about you, but you're better than I imagined.
Mother,
Juliet's fiance is here.
How are you?
Juliet, I think someone's been spreading some malicious gossip.
It's true, there's been a friendship, a profound friendship, if you will, but nothing more.
I assure you, nothing's happened that's final or irreparable.
Truth be told--
I don't know.
Right now I feel uncertain and confused.
I need some time alone.
Good-bye, then.
- I'll call you.
- Fine, sure.
I'll call you from there.
Fine.
I don't know when.
Maybe tomorrow.
Remember to set my mail aside.
Sure. Your mail.
Juliet, do you remember me?
Laura!
Do as I did.
Here everything is gray, still, silent.
Come with me,Juliet.
Just along sleep.
No more suffering.
This isn't true.
You don't exist.
Go away!
Great!
You're not real.
Go away! Go away!
It's Laura, your friend who died for love.
Buy a horse and go jumping.
Go for a nice swim.
Is there hope for me, Juliet?
Without him, you'll live and breathe, become yourself again.
She stayed with me all night but no way--
I can't come down.
I can't land.
It'sy our fault.
It's up to you.
A long sleep.
Mother, help me.
Help me, Mother.
Someone's crying.
It's the wind.
- They're calling me!
- Don't move!
Obey your mother!
- I must go!
Don't move!
Who are you?
Open up!
- You mustn't.
Obey!
You don't scare me anymore!
How's my little cutlet?
Where did you leave your grill?
Let's wave to those stiffs.
See 'em?
Here's my cutie.
Now we must leave, too.
Take me along.
Where?
It'san old plane.
It doesn't go anywhere.
It only needed to get here.
Don't hold me back.
You don't need me anymore.
I'm another of your inventions.
But you are alive.
Ciao, little cutlet.
- Who are you?
- Friends.
- Who are you?
- Friends. Real friends.
If you want us to, we can stay now.
Do you wan us to? Do you?
Listen carefully...
Four down, six to go. Come on!
- It's a good sound.
- Sí. Very good.
Soon big boats will land in our harbor.
Then much happiness.
- Un buen ano.
- Sí.
A man can't even have a decent siesta around here anymore.
Hacker, wait.
Please, Hacker, no more trouble.
Let go, Chica. I warned him.
I'll teach that Bart Thompson who's boss around here.
Is that it?
No, the two at the end haven't gone yet.
They must've gotten wet.
Give 'em a couple minutes more, and we'll plant 'em again.
Right.
Everybody stay away from the water.
We may have a couple of live ones down there.
Lou, get another charge ready.
How are you coming on the road, Dumpy?
Pretty slow, boss.
The native workers haven't shown up yet.
Oh, no.
What do you suppose the reason is today?
Mike Hacker.
Of course Mike Hacker.
I wonder what his sick excuse is gonna be.
What the world are you doing?
- Me? Nothing, boss.
- No, no. Not again, Dumpy.
Haven't I got enough on my hands today?
Come on, Julio, let's go.
I didn't do no harm, Senor Bart.
Honest he didn't, boss.
Yeah, well, if I had enough time,
I'd give you both a spanking.
Your father asked us to keep you away from here.
- And you know that too, Dumpy.
- Yeah, I know.
Hacker's not my father, Senor Bart.
All right, but he is your guardian, right?
And he's the island manager, which means we have to get along with him.
I just want to learn.
I know you do, son.
Ban!
There's a little outboard coming into harbor!
That fool's liable to get blown to kingdom come!
Keep that flag waving!
For Pete sakes, whoever it is is waving back.
- It's Betty!
- Go back, Betty!
- Go back, Betty!
- Go back!
Turn around! You're in restricted water!
Turn back!
- Are you all right?
- I guess so.
- I'm sorry, Betty. We tried to warn you.
- Oh, by taking a shot at me?
That was no shot.
That was a delayed-action charge.
Oh. Well, I guess that makes all the difference.
What in the world are you doing now?
I'm going down to Davy Jones's locker for my mother's portable icebox, in which I had stashed all sorts of goodies for you guys to eat, and which I intend to eat whether you're hungry or not.
Betty, wait! The water's not safe!
- Ain't love wonderful?
- What's happening?
They just dove in for a swim.
That's dangerous. There's still debris churning around down there.
Yeah.
Ain't love strange?
Okay. Just take it easy, Betty.
All right. Everybody back to work.
Chuck, take another diver and check out that channel bottom.
There's something strange down there.
The water was ice-cold.
We might have blown the lid off a subterranean river.
- Check it out, will you?
- Roger. Come on.
When I get out at the end here, Julio, you head on for home.
Don't want you to get into any trouble, now, do we?
No.
Julio!
Come here!
And you, get that foolish machine out of here.
All right, all right.
Next time maybe you'll stay in the cantina and do your chores like I tell you, huh?
Now, you wait here.
Come on, now.
Come on, you've got to drink this.
Bart, it's out there. I saw it. I swear!
A green monster with a head the size of this room.
What do I have to do to make you believe me?
Excuse me for intruding on this tender little scene.
Now we got a monster in here too.
You'd better start learning how to knock real quick, Hacker.
All the doors on this island are open to me, boss man.
I come here to complain about the noise you're making.
The citizenry doesn't like it.
And now I find your carelessness has almost cost us the lovely Miss Piper.
- It was my fault, Mr. Hacker.
- Nonsense.
You were supposed to put up warning signs before you started blasting.
They were up!
And this might not have happened
- if we'd had the extra men you promised.
- Men? What men?
The islanders, Hacker. Remember?
No, I don't remember.
Okay. For two weeks,
I've given you the benefit of the doubt while I've fallen behind schedule.
- From now on, we bypass you.
- That wouldn't be too wise.
The governor of the island gave us his cooperation and, as his representative, you're supposed to do the same.
Yours is cooperation, all right, but at a price, isn't it?
I look out for my people.
You bet you do.
Ban!
- Bart!
- What's wrong?
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,
I wouldn't believe it.
- What?
- The monster?
- Two of them, Betty.
- Two what? What are you babbling about?
Two huge, ugly dinosaurs perfectly preserved at the bottom of the channel.
Are they dead?
Frozen solid.
- Million-year-old dinosaurs?
- The same, Bart.
I don't know what else they could be.
But I'll tell you one thing.
- One look and you'll never forget 'em.
- You see?
This ought to be worth a fortune.
We must've blasted through the rock that entombed them.
Some compressed gas caused the freezing,
I guess.
As island manager,
I demand you bring those things up!
Tread lightly. You don't demand anything around here today.
- Is the governor still in Washington?
- So far as I know, he is.
And that leaves me in complete charge of this island.
We'll send him a wire and have him contact the Smithsonian.
He'll send paleontologists down here right away, and we'll bring the critters up and put them on the beach.
- You think the big crane will handle 'em?
- I think so.
Get her set up, and I'll be with you in a minute.
Can I trust you to send this?
You have my word. And a witness.
All right, here.
- What are you grinning about?
- Was I grinning, boss man?
Maybe it's just that this time, after all your whining, you've caused your own delay.
We can't build a harbor around two dinosaurs, Hacker.
So we take a couple hours and move 'em, and we get right back to work with no more delays.
Bravo.
You were awfully hard on him, weren't you, Bart?
I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw a- a dinosaur.
Let's go monster fishing.
Okay, Lou, we're all hooked up.
Bring her in nice and easy.
Are they really dinosaurs, Senorita Betty?
- Yes, Julio, they are.
- Boy, this is terrific!
Keep her coming, Lou.
Well? What do you think, Bart?
Thank goodness he's not alive.
You can say that again.
- Let's get our hooks in the next one.
- Roger.
Is that what you saw?
You scared me.
With him around? Thanks a lot.
I just can't get over it.
- Is he alive, Senor Bart?
- No, he's not alive.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
Then why are his eyes open?
Well, he just-
He just slept with them open, that's all.
Boy, he's magnifico. That's for certain.
Wait till you see the next one.
They tell me he's even bigger.
He must weigh about 50 tons.
He doesn't look as mean as the other one.
He's not mean. He's herbivorous.
Where did you learn a word like that?
Oh, I'm well educated in those things.
I sent away a cereal box tops and got models just like them, only smaller.
Can I go up and see them closer?
- Okay, Professor.
- Oh, thanks, Senor Bart.
Senor Bart, he's very cold.
Yeah, he's what you might call kind of quick-frozen.
How long has he been that way?
Million years or so, I guess.
Boy, oh, boy!
I'd better investigate further!
Hey, look. Why don't you go change while I get things wrapped up here, and then we'll whisk away to a romantic spot for dinner.
The only restaurant on the island.
But you've got to admit it's the best cuisine in a thousand-mile radius.
- Okay, I'll be ready in a few minutes.
- Okay.
Hey, Bart.
You think we ought to leave a guard for our little playmates tonight?
Yeah, I guess so. I don't see how anyone's gonna walk off with them though.
Give him half a chance, and Hacker would try.
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.
- Senor Bart!
- What's the matter?
He's alive! Look!
Oh, no. No, no. He's just thawing out.
- Then will he be alive?
- Nope.
Hey, don't you think you'd better head on home?
No. Senor Hacker told me to wait in the car. I guess I'd better.
Okay.
O'Leary? Off and on, me bucko!
T.J. O'Leary at your service, boss.
O'Leary, I got a job for you tonight- babysitting.
With whose children?
Those dinosaurs over there.
Oh, saints preserve us.
Them are really there?
Oh, thank the good Lord.
I've been seeing them all afternoon and was afraid to tell anyone for fear it was the DTs!
Sure, if they be needin' diapering, you can find some tarpaulins behind the shed.
Oh, sure, boss! Sure!
And they ain't the first dinosaur
I've ever seen, you know.
Why, your timing's perfect.
Are you wrinkle-free and ready to go?
Yeah. If we hurry, we'll make it there before the rain does.
It sure gets dark fast down here.
Everything happens fast in the tropics.
Who is it?
It's me, Jasper.
Come in. It's about time you got here.
It was stormy and wet out tonight,
Mr. Hacker.
Fine, fine.
I don't need your weather report.
Sit down and shut up. I'll do the talking.
We're going to be rich, boys.
You hear that, Chica?
I heard, Hacker.
You don't sound too happy about it.
Should I be?
Why, sure.
You're my little tamale, aren't you?
- Leave me alone, Hacker.
- "Leave me alone, Hacker."
I don't hear you telling the turistas
“Leave me alone."
- Let me go. You are hurting me.
- I am going to be rich, Chica.
Dress you in pretty things, soft to the touch.
- I don't want your money.
- But I want you.
And I know certain things about you that certain authorities would like to find out.
- Lies!
- They'll lock you up in jail until your pretty face is old and wrinkled.
All you know is lies!
Maybe so.
But who will be believed, huh?
You or the island manager?
So you see, Chica... you are mine.
Why not enjoy it?
And now leave us alone, my little tamale.
We have some business to discuss.
I have found a caveman.
Perfectly intact.
Probably a million years old.
We are going to take him to the mainland and sell him for a fortune.
You mean he's dead?
Of course he's dead. He's prehistoric.
That's what makes him so valuable.
What's my cut?
Yeah, and mine?
A thousand dollars apiece for helping me get him to the boat as soon as the storm lets up.
- It's a deal.
- Yeah, right. It's a deal.
Telegram.
Help yourself to some food, boys.
Hey, how are you farin', my fine, strapping babes?
A- teethin', are ya? Well.
You're a very sweet and quiet babe not to be shriekin' about it.
And you too. Mustn't play favorites.
Well, I'm going in where it's warm, boys.
You be good now and sleep tight.
Hey, Julio. What you got there?
Oh, these are my monsters
I got from my cereal box tops.
I thought I'd bring them over to show you.
Say, those are really something.
Hey, Chuck, look.
This one's the brontosaurus.
He's a vegetarian.
He wouldn't hurt you unless you got in his way and he stepped on you.
But this one's the mean one, the tyrannosaurus.
He's got a bigger brain and a bigger appetite.
He eats meat, and he likes to eat brontosaurus, even better than people.
Well, I'll be darned. You really know a lot about these things, don't you?
Oh, yes, Senor Bart. I play with them all the time. They are my friends.
Julio!
What the devil are you doing out here?
You're going to learn when I tell you to stay in the back room and finish your chores quietly, that is exactly what I mean!
- Take it easy, Hacker!
- You keep your nose out of this.
I'm sorry, Sefior Hacker!
I won't do it again!
You're going to learn a lesson, boy.
Oh, no, senor, please! That's my friend!
Hacker, that's enough.
Now come here, boy.
I hate you! I'm gonna run away and never come back!
All right, go ahead! See if I care!
Julio, wait!
If anything happens to that boy,
I swear I'll take it out of your hide.
Julio?
- You couldn't find him.
- No, I couldn't.
Don't come another step closer, boss man, or I'll...
You'll what?
I'll slash you to ribbons.
Somebody bandage him up.
A little fortification and then we'll go out and see what that last bit 0' lightnin' has done to our babes.
Earthquakes too! Ha!
This place is ridiculous.
Did you ever see such a sight in your life? I-
I swear, I'll never take another drink as long as I live!
Good girl.
I wonder how long it'll be before the lights come on again.
The last time something happened to our generator, it was two days before they fixed it.
They didn't have any power on this whole island for two days?
Yes, except for some of the houses on the hills.
They have their own generator.
Storm's about over. Round up some of the boys. We'll go have a look.
Right.
No! No!
Go away!
No!
Let me go! Oh, no! Let me out!
Help! Help! Oh, let me out!
Let me out! Let me out!
Help! They've 9011-
Let me down! Oh, you wild beast!
Let me down! Help!
- What was that?
- It wasn't thunder, that's for sure.
- It sounded like dynamite. Come on. Chuck!
- Roger.
Let's go!
Hurry up!
They'll be too close to our prize package.
No dinosaurs, no shack.
And worst of all, no O'Leary.
Hey, boss!
O'Leary's hat.
You think he's dead?
Nobody could live through that kind of an explosion, Dumpy.
Poor guy.
What happened to the dinosaurs?
Bart! Come here!
It looks like the big one just up and walked away.
Walked away?
How could he walk away if he's dead?
- It isn't possible.
- What are we going to do?
Uh-oh.
Look.
What are you doing, Hacker?
I was looking to see- to see if Julio was around here.
Under the leaves?
You can do better than that.
A fat lot you care what happens to that boy.
Will you get your hands off me?
I've had a change of heart.
Okay, I was wrong this time.
You had nothing to do with this.
You don't know what that sound was, do you?
A bird?
That's a dinosaur, Hacker.
A big, hungry, flesh-eating dinosaur.
You mean...
We gotta get back to town and start making phone calls for help.
- The phones are out, Bart.
- The overseas phone.
- Everything's out.
- How do we get word out, Hacker?
Mail boat will be in tomorrow morning.
By tomorrow, we could all be dead.
Doesn't anyone here have a shortwave radio?
Some of the fishing boats have some, but they won't be back till the end of the week.
When can we get an answer to that wire?
I... I didn't get around to sending it.
Well, that's just great.
Bart, I wish my dad wasn't away.
He's got some sort of radio rig.
- A shortwave radio?
- Yes, he's a ham operator.
But he's always taking it apart.
I don't know if it's working.
At least it's something to go on.
I think I can get it to work.
Meantime, we've got to figure out some way of defending ourselves.
How many weapons are there on the island?
Some small-game guns, a couple of pistols.
But what good would they be against those monsters?
And there's a relic cannon up at the old fortress.
- That might not be a bad idea, Bart.
- A relic cannon?
No, the fortress.
I was up there last Sunday.
It's just some old ruins, but the walls are thick and fairly high.
And there's what's left of a moat around the place.
We could widen it and burn oil as a barrier.
That sounds like our best idea.
Get the bulldozers and whatever else you need to get set up at the fortress.
- Right.
- Tell everybody on the way up there.
Hey, boss, maybe if I rang the fire gong, we could get them all out in a hurry.
No, no. All we need is a couple hundred frightened people running through town.
That monster will know where his next meal's coming from.
How about us with the heavy equipment?
I don't think he'll bother you if you travel in a tight convoy.
- Drive with your lights out.
- Roger.
Let's go, guys. Come on.
We've got work to do.
You girls go on with Chuck.
Dumpy and I will spread the word in town, and we'll get to your house and see if that radio's working.
- Bart, my mother's home all alone.
- Don't worry. We'll bring her back.
How about you, Hacker?
Are we gonna get any help from you?
I've got to go find my boy.
I feel terrible. He means so much to me.
I will risk the danger. I'll take my men, and we'll go search the island.
I understand. We'll keep a lookout too.
You see, Bart? Nobody's all bad.
Senor Bart, when I was a little girl in another country, there was a revolution.
My father taught me how to make bombs out of bottles and gasoline.
- We'll use some, no?
- We'll use some, yes.
- Run and tell Chuck that.
- Okay.
Hey, boss. There's a couple of walkie-talkies in the tool shed.
Should I get 'em?
We'll keep in touch with Chuck.
- That's a good idea, Dumpy.
- Okay.
Bart, I'm going with you.
No, you're not.
It's a lot safer for you at the fortress.
We may never get there.
If something happens,
I want to be with you.
Is that you, Betty?
How was the boy dressed, Mr. Hacker?
I didn't notice.
Don't be so style-conscious, Jasper.
We're looking for the caveman, not that brat.
I knew you hadn't changed.
Remember, you're the friendly vegetarian, like it says on the cereal box.
Hey, you are friendly.
We are going to be friends, you and me.
That's the bad tyrannosaurus!
You'd better run and find a swamp to hide in, where he won't follow you.
'Cause if he catches us, he'll eat both of us up.
And he'll like you better than me
'cause you're bigger.
And I don't want him to eat you, so please run!
I know you don't know which way to run, and I wish I could tell you.
But you see, I'm just a boy and I'm lost
'cause I don't go out at night by myself, and I don't know where the swamps are.
You see? You've got to go!
Please run! I can't push you!
That a boy!
Run, run! And keep running!
Good-bye, my friend.
I hope I will see you again soon.
Take care of yourself.
Tom, tell everyone to go quickly and quietly.
Once they get to the fortress, they should just relax.
- Dumpy, let's go!
- Okay, boss!
Hey, boss, it's a dud, ain't it?
No, you have to light that cloth tail,
Dumpy.
But a spark could do it.
- Put them in here.
- Yeah, boss.
Put them on something soft so they don't get jostled.
- And no smoking.
- You ain't kiddin'.
XLN2W calling LNR6J.
XLN2W calling LNR6J.
Do you read me? Over.
XLN2W calling LNR6J.
XLN2W calling LNR6J.
Come in, please.
XLNZW calling-
I wish we could go faster.
These roads don't help any.
We are almost there, Chuck.
Mousey!
- Did you find him?
- Nope.
The whole back part is filled with water,
Mr. Hacker.
That's why they closed this place.
They haven't used it in years.
Let's get out of here.
This place gives me the creeps.
Jasper seems to be enjoying it.
Huh, Jasper?
Sure, boss. It's very interesting.
I mean, where else are you going to find a caveman except in a cave?
“In a cave." “In a cave.“
Jasper, your intelligence never ceases to amaze me.
I didn't know you were an anthropologist.
Not a very good one, boss.
I mean, I ain't been to church in years.
Ah, well, if he's not in a cave, maybe he's in a house.
Come on. We'll start looking in houses.
Is there anyone else living out this way we could warn?
No. Ours is the next place, and it's the last one.
Betty?
Senorita Betty?
Holy smoke! A real caveman!
You want this?
Boy, you sure are hungry.
I guess maybe you are a houseguest of
Betty's scientist father, the doctor, huh?
More? Funny they didn't show you where the food was.
Come on, I'll show you. See?
We're in luck! We've got some pie. See?
You take those things over to the table while I make us something warm to drink.
I don't think Betty would mind.
You really don't know much about these things, do you?
I'll be your friend. I'll show you.
Come on, caveman, come on.
Come on.
Right here.
No. Eat with your fork.
Like this.
Eat right. Eat like this.
With your fork.
That must be Betty. Come on. Surprise her.
Show her how I taught you how to eat with a fork.
Surprise!
There he is. Get the kid out of the way, and get him with as few blows as is possible.
Run, caveman! Run! They're bad men!
No! No, caveman! It's not right to kill!
You two are worthless. Stand back.
Let a man at him. You got the rope?
Yeah, boss. Right here.
All right. I'll pin him down, you bind his hands and feet.
What are you standing there for?
Get out and get him, or I pity both of you!
Go on!
Come on. They can't be far ahead.
Come on. If we have to run all night, we're going to catch them.
Come on. Top speed.
Mother?
There's nobody here, that's for sure.
Boy, this place is a mess.
Mother!
Yeah, and whoever busted this up sure did a thorough job.
Boy, they sure did.
Mother!
- Better calm her down.
- You think...
I don't know.
She's not here, Bart.
Something's happened. I know it.
Come on, calm down. Keep your chin up.
Look, her car's gone.
She could be in town, or she might be at the fortress already with Chuck.
- Do you think she might be?
- There's a good chance.
Besides, going to pieces isn't going to help a bit.
Somebody had a sloppy feast in here, Bart.
And the teakettle's still boiling.
Whoever was here didn't leave long ago.
Dumpy, go out to the jeep and see if you can contact Chuck on the walkie-talkie.
He should be at the fortress by now.
Gotcha, boss.
- What do we do now?
- We'll head for the fortress.
See if you've got kerosene lanterns.
We could use them.
Okay, I'll get them.
Hey, boss!
Yeah?
Yeah, Chuck, sure. Just a minute.
Here he comes now.
Betty's mother is safe.
Oh, good. Tell Betty and give her a hand, will you, Dumpy?
- I sure will.
- Yeah, Chuck?
Yeah, Bart. So far, so good.
Not a sign of the monsters. And we're making pretty good progress with the moat.
If we could be sure of a couple more hours, I'd say we'd have it secured.
- How about the islanders?
- We got most of them in from the village.
There are more coming from the hills all the time.
They're frightened.
I can't say that I blame them.
When I stop to think of it,
I get pretty scared myself.
I know what you mean.
- How about Julio?
- Not a sign of him.
We'll keep our eyes peeled for him on the way back.
I'd comb the jungle if I thought there was a chance of finding him alive.
Don't be a fool, Bart. You'll have a hard enough time just getting back here.
I know.
- She said she saw an ape man?
- That's what she said, Betty.
She probably was so frightened she really didn't know what she saw.
At least she's all right. You want to take these out and put them in the jeep?
I'll get a first-aid kit in case we need it.
And don't be too long, because the sooner we get back to those fortress walls, the better I'll feel.
Okay.
Hey, boss?
Boss? Boss, where are you?
Over here, Dumpy.
Look what I found. Hacker's car.
Uh-oh. I wonder what he's got to do with that mess inside?
And the broken radio.
Check under the seats.
I don't know what to look for, but I wouldn't put anything past that man.
Bart, it's Julio!
Dumpy, we've got to get that boy!
Hurry, Bart, hurry! Julio, we're coming!
We may need those. Come on!
Boy, you sure are one terrific caveman, you know that?
I never had so much fun in my life!
I didn't know you could ride a dinosaur.
Julio! Julio!
- What are we gonna do?
- Julio, it's me, Betty!
Senorita Betty, run! Go away!
Look out behind you!
He saved her life, but there's no telling what he might do next. Come on!
This way.
I'm lost, boss. Any idea where we are?
The house is back that way.
We just got to keep going. Through here.
Whoa! Please stop!
We'll be right back where we started, and the tyrannosaurus will eat us up!
You saved my life.
I really don't know how to thank you.
I'm very grateful.
You want me to cook it? Your dinner.
I think you ought to know something before I start.
I'm not a very good cook.
You don't care, huh?
Okay. One rabbit, medium-rare.
Hope that's how you like it.
I hope you don't have anything else on your mind.
Wristwatch.
Now, now. Nice caveman. Just sit there, and I'll go fix things in the kitchen.
Now, let's see.
What does a nice caveman do after a hard day's work in the jungle?
No, no, don't tell me. Let me think of something tame on my own.
Like sitting down.
And we'll keep all other thoughts out of our romantic little Neanderthal minds.
Okay?
Let's see.
Maybe if I sing you a song, you'll fall asleep, and then I can run away from you, hmm?
Lullaby and good night
Go to sleep, little caveman
Leave my friend alone, you bad old tyrannosaurus!
Talk about ringside seats.
Hit him again with your tail!
Come on! Hit him!
Oh, no! Boss, look over there.
Boss, I don't see the kid anymore.
He's on the other side. The way they're spinning around, he could get crushed.
Come on, we got to get him.
Not that way. That's quicksand!
No! No!
Julio!
The caveman again.
Follow him, we'll get to Betty too.
- There he is, men.
- Yeah.
Yeah, but look at that monster.
We're going in to get that caveman.
I don't want the money, boss.
- It's too late for that now, Jasper.
- I'm sorry, boss. I quit.
Jasper, come back here!
We've got to get him away from that cave.
Now!
Come on, Mr. Hacker, have a heart.
I'm telling you, Mousey, it'll be perfectly safe.
Get in through that opening, climb down on the rope, take him prisoner, and bring him out when the coast is clear.
I'm scared of the monster and the bomb too, Mr. Hacker.
One. I'm tired of being disobeyed, Mousey.
I'm ashamed of myself. I really am.
Two. I mean business this time.
You know I'd do anything for you.
You know that, Mr. Hacker.
But this... this will be suicide.
- Three.
- Okay, okay. I'll go.
Mousey, you yellow coward! I'll kill you!
I'll do it myself.
That mine shaft's nothing but a bunch of rotted timbers.
It can't hold much longer the way he's going at it.
And these things don't bother him a bit.
Maybe if I could pop one right in his mouth, he'd decide to beat it out of here.
Boss, that's a good trick if you can do it.
When I tell you, you throw one of those bombs as close to his eyes as you can.
That'll attract his attention.
It'll let me get within a couple of feet, where I can't miss.
Okay.
Mr. Hacker, thank goodness you're here.
Don't anybody move.
Blasted rope. Now we have to wait for the monster to leave before we can get out.
Unless we give him some distraction while the others leave.
- You must be crazy!
- Is that what you think?
Do you know how much money people all over the world will pay to look at that monkey man?
Oh, what is this? Bravery, huh?
Little man, I could puncture holes in you with this play toy of mine.
He doesn't know what a gun is.
He's just a nice, kind-
Leave him alone!
Don't worry, boy. I won't hurt him.
He's going to be my fortune.
And you- you are going to be my way out of here.
No, Hacker, no!
I'm getting out of here!
We got rid of him for a while.
- Yeah. Boy, is he mad!
- Let's get in there.
Betty, Julio, are you all right?
- Oh, Bart.
- Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's go!
Caveman! Caveman!
Go on, go on!
- Get him out of here.
- Caveman! Caveman!
- Come on, caveman!
- Come on!
Come on!
Couple more minutes, and that dinosaur is gonna remember he's hungry again.
Did Hacker get out?
Yeah.
Caveman! Where is the caveman!
Come on!
Look!
Look, he's heading for the quicksand!
Now's our chance. Head back to the jeep.
I'm gonna take another look around here just in case.
Be careful.
I will. Now hurry.
Caveman! Caveman! Caveman!
We got a ditch all around the fortress except on the side overlooking the ocean.
We just open those drums, put a torch to the oil, and we got a moat of flames.
Good. Is everyone in the fortress?
Yeah, everybody except for the guys in the equipment.
And there's a little path over there they can go up in case they get caught outside when the fire starts.
You've done a good job, Chuck.
We got enough oil?
That's the problem. The moat had to be bigger than I anticipated.
How many minutes of flame can you give me?
Five, maybe, if we're lucky.
- No sign of the boat yet?
- No.
Pedro?
Quieres comer?
I'm not hungry.
You should eat something, Julio.
A growing boy needs-
I don't want to grow anymore.
The mail boat will soon be here.
You're probably going to get that airplane from the cereal box.
I don't care about any airplane.
Well, remember, there's a good bowl of soup if you want it.
What are you seeing out there, Dumpy?
Nothing. And right now, that looks mighty good to me.
Are you taking care of the alarm?
Hey!
Huh? Monster!
Take it easy. Relax.
The monster's not here yet.
But you keep your eyes open, and you'll be a fine alarm man.
Sí', senor. Sorry.
Sorry, senor.
I hope the rest of our setup is better than that.
Don't worry about him.
If that monster comes within a mile of this place, that bell will be ringing.
He's here! Sound the alarm!
Dinosaurus!
Monster!
We got to hold it off as long as possible.
- It's holding him.
- Yeah, but for how long?
- You're in charge. I got an idea.
- Hey, wait a minute!
Bart! Bart!
- Bart, let me come with you.
- I can't.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna knock that monster off the cliff.
I love you.
I can't hear you.
Be careful. I love you.
Chica.
Hey, Chuck, do you think we can drive the bulldozer through the fire?
Not a chance, Dumpy. Why?
To help Bart. Look what he's doing.
Come on, Senor Bart! Get him!
Watch out, Senor Bart!
Dumpy, if you've ever prayed, do it now.
- Oh, Senor Bart.
- Bart, are you all right?
- Bart, that was terrific.
- Oh, thank heavens.
- Wasn't he great?
- Senor Bart, why did the caveman have to die?
Well, Julio... there's a time for everything.
The caveman slept all those years, and then one day he awoke like Rip Van Winkle... and found the world so changed that he didn't belong in it anymore.
How would you like it if you woke in the 21st century?
No, house, no friends, even the town gone.
Just a strange world.
I would like it.
You know, I bet you would at that.
I'll bet one day you will wake in the 21st century.
You really mean it?
Yeah.
Oh, boy!
There you are, my dear.
There's your tropical island.
Look at all those people up there waving at us.
Do you suppose they greet all the ships like this?
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
On a peaceful, quiet island like this,
I don't suppose they have anything better to do.

MOTHER:. What's the matter
Father dear?
The matter? This tie. It will not tie, not round my neck.
Round the bedpost, oh,yes, but round my neck, no.
Oh, dear no.
Begs to be excused.
Say it again, Father.
Say it again.
A little less noise there. l warn you ofthis, that unless this goes round... my neck properly,we don't go out to dinnertonight. lfwe don't go out to dinner, l'll never go to the office again, and if l never go to the office again,we will starve... and our children will be flung into the streets.
CHILDREN:. Oh, no, Father!
Wait a minute, Father dear. l think l've got it.
Oh! One more day when all is right.
Oh, Nana, Nana.
Mother, look here.
Hairs all over my trousers.
Clumsy, clumsy.
-l'll brush them off, Father.
-Thankyou.
There's times l think it's a mistake... to have a dog for a nurse.
Oh, George. Nana's a treasure.
No doubt. But l sometimes have a sorrt offeeling... that she looks upon the children as her puppies.
George,we must keep Nana. l'll tell you why.
Get ready for bed, children.
Nana will take you.
That's right.
Now, run along.
George.
Tonight l saw a face at the window.
Face at the window two floors up? lt was a face of a little boy.
He was tying to get in.
Oh, it's impossible.
That's not the first time l've seen that boy.
-Oh?
-The first time was a week ago. l remember because it was
Nana's night off. l was sitting there by the fire, and suddenly l felt a draft... as though the windowwere open. l looked... and l sawthat boy in the room. l screamed.
Just then, Nana came back and sprang at him at once.
The boy leapt at the window.
Nana closed it quickly.
-lt was too late to catch him.
-l thought so.
But wait! He escaped, but his shadow hadn't time to get out. l hid it. l rolled it up.
-And here it is.
-Aha!
Well, l don't think it's anyone we know, though he does look a scoundrel.
You know, l think he comes back tying to get his shadow.
-l daresay.
-But wait! l haven't told you all.
The boy was not quite alone.
He was accompanied by... l don't know howto describe it.
A ball of light no biggerthan my fist... that darrted around the room like a living thing.
This is most unusual.
-George,what can it mean?
-What indeed?
What indeed?
Oh, Nana! Oh, my knee! My knee!
WENDY:. Father, she's cying.
She's cying? What about me?
Go and coddle her.
Nobody ever coddles me. l'm only the breadwinner.
Why should l be coddled?
Why,why,why?
Not so loud.
Liza will hear. l refuse to allowthat dog to lord over me in my nursey... one hour longer.
WENDY:. Oh, Father! ln vain, in vain. Your place is downstairs. Come on, Nana.
MOTHER:. George.
Rememberwhat l told you about that boy?
Am l master in this house or is she? Come on, Nana.
[Nana barks]
FATHER:. Ow!
Come, Nana.
Good Nana.
Nice Nana.
Dear Nana.
Pretty Nana.
Gotcha! Come out! This way!
[Family protesting]
Oh, he's chaining Nana up!
FATHER:. Out the dooryou go.
JOHN:. She's unhappy.
FATHER:. No, no. There,there.
That's not her unhappy bark.
That's her bark when she smells danger.
Wendy, are you sure?
Yes, Mother.
[Nana barking]
WENDY:. Is eveything all right? lt's all quiet and still. l wish l weren't going out to dinnertonight.
MICHAEL:. Can anything harm us, Mommy, afterthe night-lights are lit?
No, precious. They're the eyes a mother leaves behind... to guard her children.
Now sing your good-night song... and into your beds.
[Singing]
Tender shepherd,tender shepherd
Let me help you count your sheep
One in the meadow
Two in the garden
Three in the nursey, fast asleep
MICHAEL:. Tender shepherd, tender shepherd
JOHN:. Tender shepherd, tender shepherd
WENDY:. Tender shepherd, tender shepherd
Watches over all his sheep
One, say your prayers
And two, close your eyes
And three, safe and happily, fall asleep
Fall asleep
Fall asleep
Fall asleep.
Dear night-lights that protecct my sleeping children, burn clear and steadfast tonight.

What's your name?
Wendy Myra Angela Darling.
What's your name?
Peter Pan.
Where do you live?
Second to the right and straight on till morning. ls that what they put on your letters?
Don't get any letters.
But your mother gets letters.
Don't have a mother.
-Oh, Peter!
-You mustn't touch me!
But why?
No one must evertouch me.
Why not? l don't know.
No wonderyou were cying. l wasn't cying about that. l can't get my shadow to stick on. lt's come off? How awful!
Oh, ha ha ha! Peter!
You've been tying to stick it on with soap.
-Well,then?
-l'll have to sew it on foryou, my little man.
-Thankyou.
-Now,you sit there. l daresay this will hurrt a little. l never cy.
[Peterwhistling]
There!
Thankyou.
PETER:. Wouldn't you know it!
My shadow!
My vey own shadow!
WENDY:. But it's only a shadow.
Yes, but it's all mine.
Oh, l'm clever!
Oh,the cleverness of me!
WENDY:. Of course, l did nothing.
You're conceited!
Conceited?
[Singing]
Not me lt's just that l am what l am
And l'm me
When l look at myself and l see in myself
All the wonderful things that l see lf l'm pleased with myself l have evey good reason to be l gotta crow l'm just the cleverest fella
'Twas ever my forrtune to know l taught a trickto my shadow
To stickto the tip of my toe l gotta crow l gotta brag l think it's sweet l have fingers and feet l can wiggle and wag l can climb trees and play tag with the breeze ln the meadows below l gotta crow lf l were a vey ordinay
Eveyday thing l'd never be heard
Cock-a-doodlin' round like a bird
So naturally
When l discoverthe cleverness of a remarkable me
How can l hide it
When deep down inside, it just tickles me so?
That l gotta let go
And crow
[Crows]
Ha ha ha! l'm really a rare thing
Such a fairthing l can't keep still l'm bursting with pride
And l just couldn't keep it inside lf l tried
So naturally
When l discoverthe cleverness of a remarkable me
How can l hide it
When deep down inside, it just tickles me so?
That l gotta let go
And crow
[Crowing]
Oh, Peter,you are so clever.
Peter, how old are you? l don't know. l ran away from home the day l was born.
Ran away? Why?
Because l heard Father and Mother discussing... what l was to be when l became a man. l want to always be a little boy and have fun.
So l ran away, and l've lived a long time among the fairies.
Oh, Peter!
Do you really knowfairies?
Yes.
But they're nearly all dead now.
You see,Wendy,when the first baby laughed forthe first time, the laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about.
And that was the beginning offairies.
So now evey time a new baby is born, its first laugh becomes a faiy.
There ought to be a faiy for evey girl and boy.
WENDY:. Ought to be? Isn't there?
Oh, no.
Children know such a lot now.
Soon,they don't believe.
And evey time a child says
''l don't believe in fairies,'' there's a faiy someplace that falls down dead.
WENDY:. Poorthings! l can't think where she's gone to.
-Tink!
-Peter!
You don't mean to tell me there's a faiy in this room?!
She came here with me.
[Rattling]
Wendy, l believe l've shut her up in that drawer.
[Tinker Bell tinkling]
Well,you needn't say that.
[Tinker Bell tinkling]
Well, l'm vey sory.
Well, how did l know you were in the drawer?
Tink,this lady wishes you were herfaiy.
[Tinker Bell tinkling]
What did she say?
She's not vey polite.
She says you're a great ugly girl, and she's mine.
Tink,you knowyou can't be my faiy because l'm a gentleman, and you're a lady.
[Tinker Bell tinkling]
What did she say?
She said, ''You silly ass.''
She's quite a common girl, you know.
[Nana barks]
Oh, it's all right.
She's chained up.
Peter,where do you live?
PETER:. Way out there!
WENDY:. Well, how do you find yourway home?
You just follow all the golden arrows.
Where do they lead you? lt's a secret place.
Oh, please tell me.
Would you believe me if l told you? l promise.
PETER:. For sure?
WENDY:. For sure.
Then l'll tell you.
[Singing] l have a place where dreams are born
And time is never planned lt's not on any charrt
You must find it with your hearrt
Never Never Land lt might be miles beyond the moon
Or right there where you stand
Just keep an open mind
And then suddenly you'll find
Never Never Land
You'll have a treasure ifyou stay there
More precious farthan gold
For once you have found yourway there
You can never, never grow old
And that's my home where dreams are born
And time is never planned
Just think of lovely things
And your hearrt will fly on wings
Forever ln Never Never Land
Peter,what does it look like? lt's an island,Wendy.
A large one?
No. Quite small... and nicely crammed... with hardly any space between one adventure and another.
Oh, it sounds lovely.
Who else lives there, Peter?
The Lost Boys.
Who are they?
They're the children who fall out oftheir carriages... when the nurse is looking the otherway. lfthey're not claimed in 7 days, they're sent far away to Never Land. l'm captain!
What fun it must be!
Yes...
But we're rather lonely.
Peter,why did you come to our nursey window?
To hearthe stories.
None of us know any stories.
How perrfecctly awwful.
Wendy...
Your motherwas telling you such a lovely stoy.
Oh? Which stoy is it? lt was about the prince.
And he couldn't find the lady who wore the glass slipper.
Oh. That's ''Cinderella.''
He found her.
And they lived happily ever after. l'm glad!
Where are you going?
-To tell the other boys!
-Oh, please don't go! l know lots of stories.
Do you?
WENDY:. Oh,the stories l could tell the other boys.
Come on. We'll fly.
Fly? You can fly?
Wendy, come with me.
Oh, howwe should all respecct you.
And you could tuck us in at night and make pockets for us.
None of us has any pockets.
Would you teach John and Michael howto fly? lfyou like.
John! Michael! Wake up!
There's a boy here who's going to teach us to fly.
MICHAEL:. There is?
JOHN:. l'll get up at once.

NARRATOR:. Second to the right and straight on till morning.
That is the way to Never Land. lfyou close your eyes, you will see a pool of lovely pale colors. lfyou squeeze them tighter, the pool will take on different shapes, and the colors will become brighter, so bright that in a moment, they'll go on fire.
And in that moment just before they do, you will see Never Land, a magic island on whose shores children are forever at play.
[Squawking]
BOY:. Now!
-Did you catch her?
-No, but look!
Tootles, has Peter come backyet?
-No, he hasn't.
-Maybe he's waiting to hear... the end of ''Cinderella.'' l'm always afraid of pirates and Indians.
Yes,when Peter's not here to protecct us.
Oh, l'm not afraid of anything.

-Aye.
And with the first crack it will bring Tiger Lily and her Indians.
PIRRATES:. Indians!
-Do you want to lose your scalp?
-That is true.
Shall l after him, Captain, and tickle him with Johnny Corkscrew?
Johnny's a silent fellow.
No, Smee.
That's only one, and l want to mischief all ofthem.
They must be around here somewhere.
Scatter and lookforthem!
But most of all, l want their captain, Peter Pan.
'Twas he cut off me arm. l've waited long to shake hands with him with this.
Ooh, l'll tear him.
Yet l've oft heard you say... your hookwas worrth a score of hands... for combing the hair and other homely uses.
Aye. If l were a mother, l should pray that me children be born with this... instead ofthat.
But Peterthrew me hand to a crocodile... who happened to be passing by, and that croc liked the taste of me hand so much he's followed me ever since from land to land, from sea to sea he follows the ship licking his lips forthe rest of me.
Well, in a way, it is a sorrt of compliment.
Well, l want no such compliments. l want Peter Pan,who first gave the brute his taste for me.
Smee,that crocwould have got me long ere this... if it could have crept upon me unawares.
But by some lucky chance, it swallowed a clock.
A clock!
And it goes tick-to,ck-tick within him and so before he can reach me l hearthe tick and bolt!
Ha ha ha ha! Oh!

[Captain Hook singing]
To cook a cake quite large
And fill each layer in between
With icing mixed with poison
Till it turns a tempting green
We'll place it nearthe house
Just where the boys are sure to come
And being greedy
They won't care to question such a plum
The boys who have no mother sweet
No one to showthem their mistake
Won't know it's dangerous to eat
So damp and rich a cake
And so before
The blinking of an eye
Those boys will eat that poison cake
And one by one
They'll die
HOOK:. Olé!
PIRRATES:. Bravo! Bravo!
Oh, no. Stop it!
[Tick-tock]

[Singing]
Once upon a time and long ago l heard someone singing soft and low
Nowwhen day is done and night is near l recall this song l used to hear
My child, my vey own
Don't be afraid you're not alone'
Sleep until the dawn, for all is well
Long ago,this song was sung to me
Now it's just a distant melody
Somewhere from the past l used to know
Once upon a time and long ago
Wendy?

NARRRATOR:. It is night in Never Land.
Not farfrom the Mermaids' Lagoon, one green light squinting over Kidd's Creek, which is nearthe mo,uth ofthe Pirate River marks where the ship
The Jolly Roger lies at anchor.
A rakish-looking craft, fore to the hull she lies low in the darkwater wrapped in the blanket ofthe night, a cannibal ofthe seas.
How still the night is.
Nothing sounds alive.
Now is the hourwhen child,ren in their homes are abed their lips bright-browned with a good-night chocolate... and theirtongues drowsily searching for belated crumbs... housed insecurely on their shining cheeks.
Compare with them,the captive children on this boat!
Split me infinitives, but 'tis me hour oftriumph--
Peter killed at last... and all the boys about to walkthe plank.
At last, l've reached me peak! l'm the greatest villain of all time!

Years came and went without bringing the careless boy.
Wendy tried,for Peter's sake, not to have growing pains, but,you see, all children except Peter grow up.
Then...
One night, a long time after, when it was once more spring-cleaning time... the stars blew open the nursey windows.
