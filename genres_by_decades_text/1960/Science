- Hello.
- [Woman] Long distance for Scott Campbell.
- This is Scott Campbell.
- One moment, please.
Scotty, this is Joe. Joe Schiller.
How you been?
Fine, Joe. Fine.
- How's Nancy?
- She's fine. She's in bed.
Oh.
I guess I got you up, huh?
I was gonna call you tomorrow, but I have to go out of town.
I'll get right to the point,
Scotty.
- Would you be free to do a job for me right away?
- Maybe. What kind of a job?
Well, it's, uh, sort of a survey, but it could lead to something.
You know the Rochester Castle up in the hills, off the coast highway?
- I've read about it. I've never actually seen it.
- Not many people have.
Anyway, my firm represents the Rochester estate.
The castle's been out on lease about 10 years.
The lease has run out.
They've got a white elephant on their hands.
They want an architect to go up there and make a survey... condition of structure, possibility of conversion or remodeling.
- Maybe demolition.
- When would they want me to start?
You and Nancy drive up tomorrow.
You should be able to get there by late afternoon.
There's a real estate office about two miles from the turnoff... run by a guy named Quimby.
Get the keys from him.
You'll be better off staying at the castle.
It's quite a ways to a motel.
I'll be out of town tomorrow, but Loy and I will drive up and join you on Saturday.
- Hey, that's right. You haven't met Loy, have you?
- No. No.
Well, good.
We'll have a celebration.
Thanks. I just had one.
Today's our anniversary.
Congratulations.
So, we, uh... we got a deal?
We got a deal, Joe.
And thanks.
Ah, what are friends for?
See you Saturday.
- Good night, Scott.
- Good night.
[Line Clicks]
[Handset Settles In Cradle]
You can come out now.
I answered it.
- Who was it?
- Joe Schiller.
Joe Schiller?
What's he doing here?
He's not here.
He's in Los Angeles.
Just called to wish you a happy anniversary.
I'll bet.
It's kind of funny, isn't it?
I mean, we haven't seen him since... since we got married.
Must be that fine legal mind of his.
But that's not why he really called.
He offered us a job.
What kind of a job?
It's an architectural survey of a place up the coast.
An old pile called the Rochester Castle.
- You mean the one that crazy heiress built?
- Uh-huh.
Actually, it's, um, more early
Hollywood Spanish than a castle.
But she was supposed to have built some dungeons down in the basement or something.
What do they expect to do with it?
That's what they want us to find out.
Joe asked us to drive up tomorrow.
Tomorrow? You mean, like in a couple of hours?
Pretty long drive.
We'll never make it.
Good night, Frank Lloyd Campbell.
Well, it doesn't look quite the same... but I'm sure this is the road that leads up to the place.
If I could just see the lake,
I'd know.
Even if it is, we don't have the keys to get in.
I don't want to be a spoilsport, but why don't we go back and find the real estate office.
We didn't pass it on the way up, so it must be north of here.
About two miles, Joe said.
Let's take a ride up this road and see if I'm right.
Oh, come on.
Where's your spirit of adventure?
It's not my spirit of adventure
I'm worried about.
It's your sense of direction.
Live dangerously, huh?
I'm pretty sure this is the place.
I think we'd better walk it.
You said the lease had just run out.
Doesn't look like anyone's lived around here for years.
All I know is whatJoe told me, honey.
Let's have a look.
There's a lake.
This has to be it.
How did you know there was a lake, Scott?
Have you been up here before?
No, but there were pictures in the paper when they put Priscilla Rochester away.
What had she done?
Never really came out, honey.
Family declared her incompetent and put away.
Then they cleaned up whatever was going on before anyone could check it.
They must be quite a family.
Onward and upward, Mr. Campbell.
[Scott] Now, why would anyone build
a thing like that in this godforsaken spot?
- Locked.
- Is that the only door in?
As far as I know.
Supposed to be an elevator in here that goes to the top.
And that's the only road in.
She built this thing like a fortress.
What's in there?
Can't see a thing.
Well, I guess we'd better go back... and find that real estate office.
[Clears Throat]
It's a funny thing... airline hostesses, department store buyers, secretaries... they look all pretty much the same when you come right down to it.
- What can I do for you folks?
- I'm Scott Campbell, and this is Mrs. Campbell.
Oh, of course, of course.
Mr. Schiller called about you. I'm Mr. Quimby.
Come on.
Sit down, won't you?
Now, I suppose you came by for the keys to the Rochester place?
Yes.
Well, I'm glad you got here during daylight...
'cause it gets spooky up there at night if you don't know the way.
- Mr. Schiller said that you might be staying up there.
- That's right.
Well, there's a store a little ways down the road.
You can get groceries there.
Gas and lights still on.
No phone though.
- You're welcome to use mine
if you have to make a call.
- Thanks very much.
You, uh, don't happen to be superstitious, do you, ma'am? l-I don't think so.
You count 'em.
Go ahead.
Count 'em.
Thirteen.
You see? You see?
Fifty doors in the place, and only 13 keys.
Of course, they'll open everything.
Uh, Mr. Quimby...
I understand someone was leasing the castle.
That's right... for the past nine years.
- The lease ran out last month.
- Who was it?
Well, an old screwball... an old fella named Arbuckle.
Captain Sam Arbuckle, he called himself.
I understand he made his money in tent shows.
He retired up there.
- Why'd he leave?
- Search me.
Haven't seen much of him lately.
Never did see much of him.
Last two months of the lease he paid in advance.
And then he just up and walked away from it.
Didn't even turn in his keys.
That's a duplicate set you got there.
- Didn't anyone ever try to find him?
- What for?
Captain wanted his privacy the same as old Priscilla.
Well, we'd better get going.
- Thanks for the keys.
- Glad to oblige.
Anything I can do for you, just let me know.
You don't have a picture of Priscilla Rochester, do you?
After what Scott told me,
I just wondered what she looked like.
If I had one, Mrs. Campbell,
I'd be happy to show it to you.
As far as I know, there are no pictures of Priscilla Rochester.
Let's see. The last time I saw her was about four years ago.
I thought they had put her away.
They did.
She got out a few times.
Those fancy rest homes are not exactly Alcatraz, you know.
- Yes. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Quimby.
- You're welcome.
Scott, you just moved it an hour ago.
Somebody put it back.
[Engine Off]
Let's take a look at the place first.
I'll bring the stuff up later.
This is gonna be a real guessing game.
[Sighs]
You don't have to be polite.
I'll follow you.
Uh-huh.
[Chuckles]
Well!
Come into my parlor.
Scotty, isn't this really something?
If you like early Dracula.
I wonder what's up here.
I don't know.
- Let's find the elevator.
- Don't you want to try the stairs?
Tomorrow, hon.
It's getting late.
Even our own elevator.
- Ours?
- Well, there's nobody else here. Come on.
Isn't that terrific?
Wouldn't children love it?
Well, I don't imagine there's ever been a child in this house.
Shall we have a look?
[Cat Meowing]
Do you hear what I hear?
- Sounds like we have company.
- [Meowing Continues]
[Meowing Continues]
Ohh.
The poor thing must be half starved.
He looks pretty well-fed to me.
Oh, Scotty!
Okay, bring it along.
There's some milk in the car.
[Whispers]
It's okay, kitty.
So many beautiful things from all over the world.
Yeah.
There's supposed to be a warehouse full of stuff they took out of here... somewhere in L. A... if it hasn't been sold off.
Hey, what time is it?
About dinnertime.
You hungry?
I'm just beginning to get interested... after last night.
Well, why don't you wait here... and I'll see if a key on here will unlock a bedroom we can use.
- Then we'll go down and get our things.
- Okay.
Don't be long now.
[Crash]
[Crash]
[Twig Snaps]
Scott?
Scotty?
Where are you?
Here I am, honey.
Come here.
Wanna show you something.
[Gasps]
What do you think of it?
It's like something out of Dickens.
Well, you ain't seen nothin' yet.
And how do you like this?
Oh!
I thought we could make it our headquarters while we we're here.
Office, home, dining room, bedroom, all in one.
- I can set my board up over here.
- It's very cozy.
We'd better get to bed before you fall asleep.
[Moans]
- You awake?
- Mm-hmm.
Up we go.
- I'm not asleep.
- Well, prove it.
Care for one more day-after-our-anniversary toast?
Mm-mmm.
I'm for bed.
If you drop that, the estate'll sue.
Scott, one of the statues fell on the patio while I was upstairs.
- Did it break?
- All over. It's a mess.
Don't worry about it.
We'll clean it up in the morning.
Now, um, which bed do you want?
- [Click]
- [Meows]
[Yowls]
[Moans]
[Sighs]
[Meows]
[Shuffling]
Scotty!
- What is it? What's the matter?
- The door... it moved.
You stay here.
The lights are out.
Scotty, don't go out there.
Can't see a thing.
Oh, it's, uh, probably just a fuse.
I'll throw another log on the fire.
That'll do us for tonight.
Scotty, I think we ought to lock the doors.
I'll get the keys.
- I'll do it as soon as I fix the fire.
- No, I'll get them.
Fine watchdog you are.
Scott.
The keys are gone.
Honey, they weren't in the kitchen.
I couldn't find 'em anywhere.
Well... we're gonna look like darned fools... but I think we'd better, uh, go see if old Quimby's got another set.
- He said the ones he gave us were the duplicates.
- But what else can we do?
You don't suppose the police would help.
Honey, I'm not about to go tell the police...
I think someone snuck in my bedroom and took a bunch of keys.
They have a lot of trouble with kids breaking into old places like this.
They said anything, they'd just say it was a bunch of teenagers.
Well, under the circumstances...
I don't imagine the Rochester family... would like the police prying around here anyway.
That you can say again.
They have their own police.
Literally.
Oh, well, I think we'll get you a sweater and go see Quimby.
Okay.
Honey, I can get it.
Do you need anything?
- No.
- Okay.
Scotty!
Where'd you find 'em?
On the floor, under the night table.
Do you suppose they could have been there all the time?
Scotty, you know they weren't.
You looked yourself.
Wouldn't be the first time I missed something right under my nose.
Well, I doubt you could miss a ring of keys like that.
Okay then.
While we were out on the patio... somebody or something walked in here and put 'em back.
Is that what you want me to say?
What's the matter?
Scotty, count them.
That's old man Quimby's line.
Count them!
Eleven?
There were 13 when Mr. Quimby gave them to me.
You saw me count.
Well, this is... this is probably just some sort of prank, honey, some joke.
But if there is any danger,
I don't want you to stay here.
- What about the survey?
- It'll keep. We can come back later.
What if we can't?
What if they get somebody else?
Well, then... we've lost the job, that's all.
I think we oughta stay, at least untilJoe gets here.
Oh, honey, we've waited too long for a chance like this.
The Rochesters are the most creative builders in California.
You could have a ball designing for them.
- We could have a ball.
- You said it. I didn't.
Should we get our tape and start measuring?
All right, but, uh,
I wanna try something first.
There are two keys missing out there.
Let's find out which two rooms someone doesn't want us to see.
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Sighs]
Looks like we found one of them.
Are you sure you tried all of the keys?
One place down here we haven't tried yet.
What now?
[Doorbell Rings]
Hello.
- You're Scott Campbell?
- Yes.
Where is Joe?
How do you do?
Uh, where's Joe?
Isn't he here?
Oh, you're Mrs. Schiller.
- I thought you and Joe were coming together.
- So did I.
- You haven't seen him then?
- No.
Oh, excuse me.
This is my wife Nancy.
How do you do again?
I'm Loy Schiller, Joe's wife.
How do you do? Would you like to take your things upstairs?
I don't know. lfJoe isn't here...
Oh, he'll be along.
He had to go out of town on business.
Yes, that's what he told me also.
Well...
Thank you.
Isn't this nice?
Just like being home. Almost.
Well, we like the fireplace, and it is big enough for Scotty's things.
Oh! I forgot.
You're the, um... architect, no?
- Yes.
- Am I keeping you from working? Sorry.
Oh, no need to be.
We've just come to do a little measuring.
- Haven't even started yet.
- You help him with this?
Well, let's just say
I hold one end of the tape.
- It must be nice working with your husband.
- You'll have to ask him that.
Oh, I don't have to.
Not you two.
Go do your measuring.
[Gasps]
Is this your cat?
No.
She comes with the house.
Perhaps I should find you another room, if you're staying.
I don't know if we're staying.
You'll have to askJoe.
- Well, we'll be close by if you need anything.
- Thank you.
[Sighs]
Sounds likeJoe needs a marriage counselor more than he needs an architect.
Well, all he's got here is an architect.
I'm keeping my nose out of it.
Where do you suppose he is?
I was wondering that myself.
Six feet, 11 inches.
Let's get this one.
- Well, hello down there.
- Hi.
- Oh, I borrowed a towel. I hope it's all right.
- Of course.
I decided to sunbathe while you're working.
If I'd known you were coming,
I'd have arranged for a swimming pool.
To tell you the truth,
I swim on the bottom.
- How do you say? Like a rock.
- [Laughs]
I don't imagine you get too many complaints.
Thank you.
Well, there's a chaise lounge right on the patio.
[Door Opens]
- Let's leave the foreign aid to Washington, hmm?
- [Door Closes]
[Door Closes]
- Can I fix you some lunch?
- Oh, thank you.
It's late.
I won't have lunch today.
So I won't be... how do you say it?
Like a barn door.
[Nancy]
I think I'll diet with you.
America is the only place where people worry about eating too much... instead of not enough.
Well, now that lunch is over...
we might as well get back to work.
Six feet, four and one half inches.
[Groans]
If I do much more bending, my knees are gonna give out.
Just one more measurement, and then we'll have the floor done.
[Loy]
Are you finished?
It's getting cold.
I think I'll change.
What are you doing with all those numbers?
Well, you see, before I can make my survey...
I have to make the floor plan of each level.
- Oh. You draw that on the board downstairs?
- Later on.
You haven't seen Joe yet?
- Mm-mmm.
- Ooh!
Somebody's going to catch it.
- Just think... you might have married him.
- [Door Closes]
Now, really, lover. I just wanted some people I know to think that.
Touché.
And on that note,
I think I'll fix us some drinks.
Oh.
- We never did finish the other measurement.
- Let's save the knees, shall we?
We didn't find that other room either.
There were two keys missing, remember?
Honey, by the time we finish this measuring, we'll find it. Don't worry.
- Now, are you ready for that drink?
- I guess so.
[Gasps]
[Exhales]
Oh, it's you!
- You made me jump.
- Hello, Nancy.
Well, Joe!
How are you?
Fine, Scotty.
Good to see you.
We've been waiting for you.
- How did you get in?
- Well, the downstairs door was open.
Look, uh, why don't you two go ahead and sit down. I was gonna get some drinks.
Good.
I could use a drink.
Where's Loy?
I, uh, saw her car outside.
Well, she went down to our room to change.
She's been waiting for you too.
Yes, I know. I was supposed to pick her up, but she'd already left.
Well, perhaps she misunderstood.
Was she, uh, all right?
I mean... how did she feel?
Well, she seemed very nice to me.
She's been sunbathing most of the afternoon.
Well, it's getting dark.
What do you say we turn on some lights?
- Oh, uh...
- What's the matter?
The lights went out last night.
Scotty was going to fix them.
Oh?
[Chuckles]
- Looks like he already did.
- Well, he couldn't have. I've been with him all day.
- Anniversary wine.
- [Joe] Oh, fine.
Scott, did you, uh, fix the lights?
Lights? No. Why?
Well, it must have been a power failure.
Well, let's sit down and have some wine in the country.
I got a couple of jugs in the car.
I'll get them later.
Must have been spooky around here last night without any lights.
There have been a lot of little spooky things around here, Joe.
I wanna talk to you about 'em.
Well, here's to crime.
Or to old acquaintance.
I'll drink to that.
How very nice.
Old school friends.
You, uh, want to explain where you've been?
- I told you I'd pick you up.
- You're so polite, Joe.
- Such a gentleman.
- I asked you a question.
You're very good at asking questions.
Always the little lawyer.
- Sit down, Loy.
- I will not sit down.
You tell me you go to Santa Barbara, so I call your room.
- Loy, I told you...
- I call your room, and who answers?
I tell you who answers.
A girl!
Some kind of a girl.
- Sit down. Let's talk this thing...
- I will not sit down.
Loy.
- I'm sorry.
- Joe, do you want me to go down and talk...
No, no. Thanks, Nancy.
She's like a Roman candle.
I'll do it later.
She's right, in a way.
There was a woman in the room.
An ex-girlfriend of one of our senior partners who'd like to be single again.
You see, our firm doesn't like divorce cases, so I was...
I was asked to handle it quietly.
Well, I don't see anything so wrong with that.
The last one was pretty messy.
I promised Loy
I wouldn't take any more.
You didn't have to do it, did you?
No.
But let's face it... that's one way junior partners eventually become senior partners.
Why don't you run down and talk to her?
Because that's just what she wants me to do.
[Whimpering]
[Screams]
[Screaming]
[Buzzing]
I'll get her.
If she'd gone, we'd have heard her car.
We're six stories high.
You can't hear anything up here.
Come along then.
Maybe it'll help.
It's locked. I must have snapped something when I came in.
If it's locked, how would Loy get out?
If she slammed it, it probably locked by itself.
Well, if I know her, she slammed it, all right.
Well, her car's still here.
She, uh, must be in the house somewhere.
If she found the door locked, she must have gone up the stairs.
- Where do they lead?
- Just up to the top floor.
Well, back where we started from.
Scott, I'm worried.
Loy's angry with me.
She's probably just trying to get even.
She does things like that.
No, no, Joe.
There's been something wrong ever since we got to this place.
Who put the barricade back up? Who took the keys? Why the locked room upstairs?
I say, let's get the police up here
and open that door.
Now, wait a minute, Scotty.
The Rochesters spent a fortune trying to keep the police out of here.
Do you realize what fools we'd look like if Loy should walk in and say, "Surprise"?
Mm-hmm.
What about the locked room?
What about it?
It's probably empty.
But if we call the police in, the whole thing will be reported.
I'd like to try explaining that one at the office Monday.
- Joe...
- Scotty, it's all right for you to play independent.
You probably got a dozen architectural jobs waiting if you blow this one.
But I'm committed.
Joe, you know I don't.
But there's something wrong around here... whether Loy is playing hide-and-seek with you or not.
Let's start with the old man...
Uh, Captain what's-his-name... Arbuckle.
- What do you know about him?
- Not very much.
Supposed to be a colorful old character.
Liked his privacy.
I don't understand why nobody's ever looked for him.
Why should they? He paid his rent, left the place in good order.
How do you know he left?
And what about the old lady, Priscilla Rochester?
Don't worry about her.
They've got her locked up.
But Mr. Quimby said she'd escaped before, and that she came here.
All right.
Now, what do you want me to do?
[Chuckles]
Look, Joe.
I know how you feel about publicity...
I don't want it any more than you do.
But if we can't call the police...
I think we oughta start investigating... the various possibilities ourselves.
For a starter,
I'd like to call the sanitarium... and see if our Priscilla Rochester is present and accounted for.
Well, I suppose the smart thing for us to do would be to leave.
Can't very well do that till we find Loy.
They wouldn't talk to you at the sanitarium.
Want me to do it?
- There's no phone here.
- I know, but I can run down and use Quimby's.
I wish you would, Joe.
Well, I guess the least I can do is try to keep peace in your family.
Oh, incidentally, Joe...
still a secret, what the old lady did
to make 'em put her away?
It's still a secret.
But there's no harm in telling you, I suppose.
She killed a man with a shotgun she kept to scare off trespassers.
- Who was it?
- I don't know.
Some man who wandered up here.
Some bum nobody ever heard of.
He never was identified because she, uh... she blasted his head off.
[Engine Starts]
Operator, would you get me the number of the Brady Sanitarium in DeJur?
Thank you.
Yes?
- [Operator: Faint]
Thank you.
Oh, uh, could you get the number for me?
If you would, please.
You think the old lady flew the coop again, eh?
[Rings]
Brady Sanitarium.
[Phone: Joe, Faint]
- Well, who are you?
- [Joe Continues, Faint]
I see.
Well, you don't have to worry.
I checked her myself less than an hour ago.
I wish you'd check her again.
It's quite important.
- [Nurse, Faint]
- I know that, but these aren't the customary conditions.
I don't want to send someone out there at this time of night.
All right, Mr. Schiller... if that's what you want.
I'll be right back.
She's gone to have a look.
I'd, uh, like to keep this between you and me.
If she's there, there's no need for anyone to know about this call.
I got you.
You don't have to worry about me.
Spying! I caught you spying!
[Screams]
Always spying!
[Screaming Continues]
What do you suppose she's doing?
Spying! Spying! Spying!
I'll get you!
You don't have a thing to worry about, Mr. Schiller.
Miss Rochester is in her room, in bed.
I see.
You're absolutely sure?
[Nurse, Faint]
Good night.
[Doorbell Rings]
Did you hear something?
- [Doorbell Rings]
- Oh, Joe must be back. Front door's locked.
Scotty, what are you going to tell him?
What can I tell him?
We've almost searched the whole house and haven't found her.
He seems to be taking it rather calmly so far.
Yeah.
Well, maybe he found out something. l... I'll wait here.
I'd rather you told him.
All right.
But you stay put.
Okay.
- Did you find Loy?
- No.
I checked with the sanitarium.
The old lady's in bed in her room.
What the devil could have happened to Loy?
She must be in the house somewhere.
Nancy and I have been looking ever since you left. There's no sign.
Let's get back.
I don't want to leave her alone.
[Screams]
Honey. What's the matter?
What happened to you?
[Trembling]
It looked like Loy.
- Did you see her?
- [Gasping]
Where did you see her?
Huh? Honey, tell me where you saw Loy.
[Stammering]
In... In the last room at the end of the hall.
Is this the door?
Are you sure that's the room?
There's nothing in there.
It's empty.
Honey.
Honey, are you sure you didn't make a mistake?
Nancy, how did you see Loy?
I mean, what was she doing? l-I don't know. l-I thought I did, but I just don't know.
It's all right.
All right.
Here, sit down.
Give her a few minutes, Joe, and then we'll find out what it's about.
- Oh, Scott, did you check all the rooms?
- Yeah.
- What about the one upstairs, the one that was locked?
- Not that one.
- Still can't get in.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, what do you say you and
I have a look before we call the cops?
I've already kicked in one door tonight.
One more won't hurt.
All right.
Honey, come here.
Come on.
Honey, I want you to lie down until we get back... and I want you to lock the door from the inside with this key.
- Leave the key in the lock. Okay?
- Okay.
We won't be more than a couple minutes.
[Lock Clicking]
Scott, what do you suppose...
I don't know, Joe.
Let's get it over with.
I wanna get her out of here.
- How's your shoulder?
- All set.
Scott.
My God.
Must be the old man...
Captain Arbuckle.
Murdered in bed.
There's nothing we can do, so let's go.
Scott. Scott.
Do you suppose Loy is...
The police'll find her, Joe.
Now, come on.
[Knocking]
Nancy, it's me, Scott.
Unlock the door.
Come on, honey.
We're gonna go to the police.
We just found the old captain upstairs.
He's dead.
You two go ahead.
I'm gonna keep looking for Loy.
All right.
We'll be right back.
I'd feel a lot better if you had a gun.
Lawyers don't carry guns.
Their clients do.
- The 13th key.
- What?
Honey, we have one more place to look.
GetJoe for me, huh?
- Oh, Scotty, I don't...
- Look, nothing's going to happen to me.
Now, please getJoe.
I think I know where Loy is.
Come on.
That's enough!
Leave him alone!
It's all right.
Go now.
Why, you're... you're all a...
You can say it, Mr. Campbell.
Freaks.
No. I was gonna say carnival people.
Captain Arbuckle owned a carnival.
A circus.
A small one, but it was a circus.
But you...
You mean, he hid you here... when he retired?
I was his housekeeper, cook.
We took the others in when they needed help.
But we never let anyone know because of his lease.
[Woman]
You can come down now.
- Oh, Scotty!
- What have you done with my wife?
We haven't done anything with your wife, Mr. Schiller.
That's why you're here.
He'll show you.
But you must be lying.
I saw her.
What you saw... was a combination of two old sideshow illusions... the Locked Room and the Headless Woman.
The captain has others stored down here... a mermaid, spider-girl.
It's all done with mirrors.
You've probably seen them dozens of times.
- What have you done to her?
- Just a sleeping pill.
She's very excitable.
Is that the way you killed Captain Arbuckle?
Mr. Schiller, the captain was the only friend we had.
We didn't kill him.
He died one night in his bed, peacefully.
As you can see,
it isn't easy for us.
The captain took us in many years ago... when the sideshows began to break up.
When he died, we just locked the door.
We didn't know what else to do.
Well, you, uh... you could have called a doctor.
You didn't explain to them.
We had nowhere to go.
We needed time to think, to plan.
When you came, we hoped to scare you away.
Where will you go?
Can we go?
The police will probably want to ask you a few questions.
What will they do to us?
Well, under the circumstances, I, uh...
I don't imagine anything.
Uh, as far as we're concerned...
you can go.
Come along.
It's time for us to leave.
Where will we go?
We'll have to find a carnival again.
It won't be so bad.
- The faces...
- Oh, come along. Come along.
We've all been looked at before.
And in the remote outer reaches of the universe,
past civilization as we know it,
is a galactic system called, the Milky Way.
Now this minor galaxy contains in its backwards area a rather piddling star known as: The Sun.
With a really pitiful array of planets.
So much for our lesson in space geography.
And I hope you all took notes.
They'll be a test first thing in the century, now then...
Where is he?
Well, speak up. Where is Kreton?
During recess, I saw him kick the ball over Cloud 9.
On purpose.
Oh, but he said he'd be right back Mr.
Delton.
Yes, he better be.
I wonder if he's headed...
There again! Oh, no.
That's Kreton, alright.
Goofiest driver in the whole school.
Kreton.
Uh-uh, mustn't touch.
Let's go buster, back here where you belong.
- It's him.
- It's he.
Alright young man, I know you're there, come out.
Why don't you come in?
Because I'm the teacher and I said, come out.
Well, I didn't mean any harm, Mr. Delton.
You see, Mr. Delton? I found my ball.
- Oh, I'll get it.
- Oh, no you don't.
Young man, you and I are going to have a little heart to heart talk.
Back to your seats all of you.
Not you.
Now then... you know perfectly well you've been forbidden to visit, that odious little planetoid in the solar system.
But Mr. Delton, the Earth isn't a planetoid, it's a full grown planet, it has six continents, five oceans, 2 moons...
- One moon.
- One moon?
Well, anyhow, it's my hobby.
See, and well, as I calculate it, right now down there, they're having a very interesting period: The Civil War.
Well gee whiz, Mr. Dalton.
Every guy should have a hobby.
Not in your case.
Remember Mars, your last hobby?
We should have never let you set foot on the place.
Bare, barren, desolate.
Nobody goes there anymore.
No...
Say, maybe if they put in gambling you know...
Nothing would help.
Thanks to your thoughtlessness,
Mars is a dead planet.
What good is it?
Well, you could...
Now Kreton, I want you to write:
"I will not visit the earth",
10 billion times.
Stay after school a bit, if necessary.
But Mr. Delton, I got a date with the fellas, to go space skiing.
I got wax on my feet and everything.
10 billion times.
10 billion.
Well.
Did he say 10 billion times, or 10 million times?
What's the difference I'll start with the first time.
I... will... not... visit... the...
He's gone again. Boy, is he in for it.
You mean, "is the Earth in for it."
It is...
It is one of them.
It is. It is.
Hello Mr. Mayberry.
I just picked up my costume for your party tonight.
What are you going as?
General Lee, same as every year.
What are you looking at?
A flying saucer.
A what?
Didn't you see it?
Well, no sir.
This is the real thing, Conrad.
Look for yourself.
You see it? Do you see it?
Now, Mr. Mayberry, there ain't nothing up there except a little old cloud.
Oh, give me those.
Little old cloud nothing. There she is.
Going round and round and round.
- Let me have another look.
- Just as plain as day.
- Well?
- I'm looking.
What is your considered opinion, Conrad?
You won't get mad?
Well, of course I won't.
Well, Mr. Mayberry, my considered opinion is:
You oughta' see an eye doctor.
You got astigmatism.
Eye doctor!
Well, I gotta get over to Spelding's,
I gotta drop these flowers for Ellen.
Astigmatism!
To wear to your party tonight.
Bye-bye.
Oh, my goodness.
It's wiggling like a hula-hoop.
George, I fully realise that you are vice president in charge of programming but I will not pull my punches.
The American public has faith in Roger Putnam Spelding.
And I intend to expose this flying saucers scare, once and for all.
On my telecast tonight.
Hello, hello.
Rheba, will you please get off the telephone I'm talking to New York.
I'm sorry dear, I was calling the Mayberry's.
Do you think you he'll need more mint for the juleps?
Rheba please, I'm talking to George Abercrombie.
Really? Oh, hello George and goodbye.
Evening, Conrad.
Evening, Mrs. Spelding.
Not dressed yet for the party?
Plenty of time, Mrs. Spelding.
Oh, darling, there's some terrible force that just keeps driving me on and on and on.
Will you just restrain that terrible force because I'm getting prickly heat again.
Don't forget to dress for the party, Conrad.
Honey, let's get married right now.
Conrad, as you may have suspected,
I find you sexually attractive, but you just don't have any... money.
Well, I don't happen to believe in money.
Ellen, no marriage til we finish college and get our degree.
Oh I don't know, maybe marriage is all I'm fit for.
Breeding.
Out in the fields and an hour later back to the plow.
Carrying my newborn child on my back.
Ellen!
If you're going to talk that way, go where smart talk is appreciated.
Go to a bar or a bus station.
Sometimes I wonder if all that cod liver oil, wasn't a mistake.
Children were stuffed with it.
And now look at them.
I'd like a big family.
So would I.
Let's start right now.
- Conrad.
- We'll get married.
And then our weekend at the lake.
All I am saying George, is that it's high time the American public grew up.
How does it look dear?
George, I am not calling all of the American public, "boobs," only the boobs that believe this dribble.
I'll admit it's a bit daring but after all, Scarlet was, a hussy.
Rheba, for heaven's sake.
- Hurry, or we'll be late for the party.
- Shh.
Rhett...
I am going as Jefferson Davis.
Now that's final George.
My program goes on the air exactly as we taped it this morning.
Goodbye.
Censorship, the curse of the intelligent man.
And what are you doing?
He's just giving me a hand, daddy.
He certainly is. Get it out of there.
Her zipper stuck, Mr. Spelding.
No man has the right to zip a girl, until they're engaged.
Oh, I'm sure we can trust Conrad, he's very mechanical.
Mr. Spelding, what do you think about these UFO reports?
Poppycock.
Mr. Mayberry doesn't think so.
He swears he saw an unidentified flying object, heading towards Richmond a little while ago.
Bob Mayberry saw the Richmond plane heading towards Richmond.
Mass hysteria that's what it is.
I am laying it on the line tonight for the American public.
You could be wrong, dear.
Space men. There ain't no such animal.
That's the phrase I'm hitting them with on my telecast.
Remember that scoop you had about Elvis.
You said he was going into the Navy.
Why don't you go home and get dressed?
Yes, sir. Ouch!
I'll be back soon Ellen.
All right dear.
Some mechanic.
Flying saucer over Richmond.
Now I've heard everything.
There ain't no such animal.
Safe.
Good evening, I wonder if you could help me?
Am I any where near eh...
Oh, I guess he hasn't learned to read yet.
What's the matter Rags? Hungry?
Rheba, when are you going to feed this dog?
I think he's trying to tell you something.
Of course he is, he's trying to tell me he's hungry.
You see, he's not hungry at all.
- Now, where he ever learn that trick?
- I don't know.
Someone at the side door. I'll get it dear.
Rheba, it's almost seven do you mind turning on the TV set in the living room.
Of course, dear. Any particular channel?
My channel.
I want to watch me. Nobody else in this house does.
- Yes?
- Good evening, madam.
My name Kreton, and my respects to General Lee.
I should like to see him instantly.
General Lee? Oh, you mean Bob
Mayberry down the road.
That's where the party is.
But I'm here for the battle.
Oh, I don't think it will be a brawl, although last year...
We will be leaving in a few minutes.
Why don't you just drive over with us, Mr. Crouton?
Uh, that's Kreton. And thank you very much.
TVset warmed up yet?
Just turning it on, dear.
My husband's television program.
He's very popular they tell me.
Oh, really?
- Oh, Mr. Kreton?
- Yes?
Do sit down and watch.
Well, television in 1361 .
That's funny, I thought it came much later.
- Smoke if you'd like to.
- Thank you.
And stop whatever you’re doing.
Yes, stop and reflect a moment.
Are you a thinking man?
Yeah, I think, I'm a thinking man.
Why not review your smoking habits.
Wait, I'm busy thinking.
Do it now.
Yes, sir.
But first... relax.
Get comfortable.
You mind if I sit down?
Sit down.
Thank you, you're very kind.
Now then, before you light up...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Inspect the filter at the end of your smoke.
Look inside... look closely.
What do you see?
Tobacco, what would you see?
Inspect the tobacco.
Try a crumble test.
A crumble test?
Rub the tobacco between your hands.
Now, whiff it.
Wait, I'm still busy crumbling.
Whiff it!
Oh, yes sir.
Does it have that fresh deep down aroma?
Makes you stop and think, doesn't it..
It made me stop and sneeze.
So men just throw that old smoke of yours away.
And try one of these.
Put it between your lips.
Close your eyes.
Now... light up.
Yes... light up... and live.
Light up and live?
Man. I'm going to be burned to death.
You damn Yankee.
His name is Kreton.
Why can't he walk over there?
Who is he anyway?
Some friend of the Mayberry's.
A nice young man.
Oh, confound it. I'm missing me.
This dog has gone nuts. Now scoot, jump.
For several years now certain lunatics elements,
have proclaimed the existence of flying saucers.
I should like to nail the subject down once and for all.
There ain't no such animal.
There is no life on other planets capable of building spaceships
and to interject a purely American note,
no country in the world but ours,
has the industrial know how to build such a ship.
Right.
Let me show you some recent photographs
of objects purported to be spaceships.
- Why, president Jefferson Davis.
- Number one.
Of all people, I can't tell you how glad I am to meet you...
Oh, I'm awfully sorry, sir.
For what?
Number two.
Your left side-burn sir...
They, shot it off.
Number three.
- Quiet.
- I'm sorry?
I'm trying to listen.
Oh. I'll listen also sir.
And number four.
Optical illusions, every one of them.
Mass hysteria.
That's telling them, eh, boy.
Yes, sir. It's too bad, is full of hooey.
Hooey?
Oh well, I believe that's the expression, sir..
Or is it eh, goofidust?
No, hooey! That's it. He is full of hooey.
There's no need for alarm. No need at all.
We shall return to Roger
Putnam Spelding, in a moment.
But first. Have you inspected your filter lately.
Smoke Supurbo.
Superb tobacco superbly blended
a superb filter.
Mr. President, don't you listen to him.
He'll burn your whiskers off.
Oh, stop.
I mean it, sir. He did a job on me.
He burned my head and my face...
You think I'm full of hooey, eh?
Oh, no sir. I didn't say you were full of hooey,
I said that... that... that...
Well... your not Jefferson Davis.
Your him that man on TV.
- That Roger Pelman Sputing.
- Spelding.
I know who I am. The question is: Who are you?
Oh, no sir. The question is: When am I?
When are you?
What I mean is... what year is this?
I'm 99 years off.
What year did you have in mind?
1861 . You see, I was on my way to the Civil War and something went wrong with the machine, or my calculations, I don't know which, but...
I landed here 99 years out of my way.
But I never was very good at dates.
Are you trying to pull my leg?
No, sir, but if you'd like me to...
Oh, I've been awfully rude, sir,
I haven't introduced myself.
My name is Kreton.
I'm from the other side.
The other side of where?
The other side of the universe, another planet.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Actually, what...
Come on, come on, I know a trick when I see one.
Now where's the wire that you did this with?
What is this?
I'm sorry, I neglected to warn you.
You see,
I can touch you but you mustn't touch me, you understand?
Look, I'll show you.
You see?
They do exist and you're one of them.
Well, you... you come from out there.
That's it, yes indeed.
But that's our little secret now, isn't it Mr. Spelding?
That's odd. I thought
I turned that motor off.
Oh, I'll be spending the night here.
That is... if it's convenient.
I'll be right back.
When you boobs my friends, I simply repeat:
When it comes to visitors from outer space,
there ain't no such animal.
That's what you think, you stupid boob.
Oh, Mr. Delton, sir.
You playing hookey too?
I certainly am not.
So you've gone over the cloud again eh?
What's your excuse this time?
Another missing volleyball?
Oh, no sir. No, Mr. Delton.
I-I lost my marbles.
You lost your marbles long ago.
Well, I'll tell the truth, Mr. Delton.
You see the reason I played hookie and came down here is, because well, I like the Earth and I like the people on it, and well sir, can't I study them?
Absolutely not.
But it would be like homework, sir, after all I am majoring in the planet Earth.
Under no circumstances.
On second thought, maybe you ought to get this out of your system.
It might do you a world of good.
Another world that is.
You mean I can stay then, sir?
For a bit.
But remember Kreton, there's a wise old proverb that goes
"up is down and down is up..."
"And never the twain shall meet."
Yes, I remember it.
I remember it well, sir.
But you must keep in mind that this visit of yours, must be a secret.
And don't get involved with these
Earth people. You can't trust them.
No, you can't trust them at all, sir, except Mr. Spelding, he's very nice, an he wouldn't tell a soul about me.
He wouldn't, eh?
At this very moment, he's calling New York. Listen.
I don't care if he is having dinner.
This is important.
I'll fix his wagon.
What are you going to do, Mr. Delton?
That joker is getting the old "86."
Oh no don't disintegrate, him Mr.
Delton, please.
He's a very nice man, and he's going to a party later and his wife won't have anyone to dance with.
Couldn't you just throw an old 14 at him?
- 14 it is.
- Your very kind.
Here's how I start my program tomorrow...
Well, speak up man. I have a dinner party waiting for me.
How do you intend to start your broadcast?
Mary had a wittle wamb, its fleece was white as snow, and everywhere that Mary went.
Roger, are you out of your mind?
The wamb... was sure... to go.
Spelding you're drunk.
Study these Earthlings but don't get involved.
No, I won't.
Do you worry, Mr. Delton and thank you very much.
And I'll be a good boy, Mr. Delton.
Have a good trip.
So long.
What happened?
Well, you were snitching so you got a 14.
You could have gotten an 36.
What's an 86?
Come, I'll show you.
Well?
Watch that plant.
That's an 86.
You'll like him, he's really a very nice young man.
- Mr. Kreton.
- Yes?
This is my daughter, Ellen.
Hello.
Huh. 36.
That's better... much better.
Pardon?
- I mean... this bend...
- What?
What I mean to say is that, it does something for girls.
You see, where I come from, the girls are 36 straight and that's it.
But this, breaks up the monotony.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- He is cute, mother.
I was right.
I was right. I was right.
Good evening, Ellen, Rheba.
I just received a flash from headquarters on the flying saucers.
It's confirmed Roger.
Why I even saw one with my own eyes, as plain as day.
There were machine guns sticking out of the side and underneath it had a rack of bombs, and a tremendous cannon poking out of a pillbox on the top.
Oh, ho ho?
- How do you do.
- How do you do.
Have we met?
No, unless you've ever been to X-47.
This is Mr. Mayberry. He's host to the party tonight.
Oh?
Nice costume.
Right costume, wrong century.
Oh, get this, Rog, get this.
At 1300 this evening, an unidentified flying object was spotted high over...
Bob, you shouldn't read that in front of Roger.
Remember, there "ain't" no such animal.
"No such animal," as what, mother?
As visitors from beyond.
Teensy-winsy little men with long green feelers like this.
Excuse me, Mrs. Spelding, but the long green feelers went out with the short red tails.
Short red tails??
Bob, Rheba, for heaven's sake.
Short red tails!
That's a good one.
No.
Oh no.
Yes, yes indeed. You put fingerprints all over it.
I mean, I don't care for me personally, but we are supposed to keep it clean.
You know, sloppy barrier, sloppy mind.
You know what's going on Rog, tell us?
I can't. I have to watch out for that old 86.
Look what happened to the azalea plant.
It's withered!
That's what I mean.
Can I tell them, please?
Well, as long as I am going to be a guest in your house,
I suppose it'll be alright.
But remember now.
This is our little secret.
- You see...
- I'm from another world.
- From another...?
- Planet.
- It's true.
- Jupiter?
Jupiter? No one lives on Jupiter.
Well, at least no one I know.
Why did you come here?
Oh... I guess it was a combined pleasure and study trip.
You know, a visit to your small planet from mine.
8,000,000 light years away.
3,000,000. Imagine.
Poor boy, you must be exhausted.
I am as a matter of fact a little pooped right now.
A good night sleep will take care of that.
I'll fix up the guest room.
Oh, well, thank you very much.
Hi everybody.
Hi, Conrad.
What is he supposed to be?
A spaceman.
At least that's what I would have said 10 minutes ago.
Ain't I something?
Excuse me, please.
How do you do?
I wonder, do you mind?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
You know I'm sick and tired of going to this old ball every year dressed as Stonewall Jackson.
This year I'm going as a sure enough spaceman.
Boom boom.
Oh, you don't need that to boom boom.
May I?
Sure.
Mr. Spelding, who is that?
That you boob, is a spaceman.
A spaceman?
You're kidding.
Will you please sit down and shut up?
Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Spelding.
Get this thing off me!
Get it off.
Yes, I will. Just a second.
Oops I'm sorry, Mr. Spelding. I guess I aimed just a little too high.
If you'll just take your hands down and relax.
Just hold perfectly still.
There we are.
See, Mr. Spelding, I can but you can't.
Sure enough ever loving cotton picking spaceman.
Here you are Mr. Spelding,
I hope that I didn't upset...
Guest room's ready.
Thank you, very much Mrs. Spelding.
I hope I didn't put you out.
And you'll find some of Mr. Spelding's clothes in the closet.
Feel free to wear them.
My clothes?!? Are you radioactive?
Oh, you needn't worry about that sir,
I've had my shots.
Well, enjoy yourselves everybody.
I'm going to beddy-bye.
- Goodnight.
- You forgot your bag, Kreton.
Oh, so I did, thank you. And thank you.
Bob...
Where are you going?
I know my duty when I see it.
I'm reporting this to state militia.
I wouldn't do that. He wants it kept secret.
Secret?
Oh. Of course. You can trust me, Rog.
Won't tell a soul.
Conrad?
I won't tell a soul either Mr. Spelding.
Your darned right you won't.
You think I'd let a blabber mouth like you get me in trouble?
You are not leaving this house tonight.
You are sleeping here.
In my room.
I'm sorry, Mr. Spelding, I just can't.
I mean... well, I'm not gonna leave
Myrtle alone in my place all night.
- Myrtle?
- His goat daddy. Remember?
Oh yeah...
Myrtle hasn't been a bit well Mr. Spelding.
She looks very piqued.
And in the last couple of days she's been running a temperature.
Well, she can run it over here.
Put Myrtle in our barn.
- Is it air conditioned?
- Get going.
Yes sir, I'll do that.
What about the party daddy?
We are not going to the party.
Good evening, good evening.
Mabel, Mabel. Get them to the living room.
- What?
- Get them into the living room, please.
Hurry, dear, hurry.
Will you all please go into the living room and enjoy yourself.
I'll be there in just a moment.
Have fun.
Robert, what in the world...?
Don't ask any questions, Mabel.
This is the biggest thing that ever happened to Manassas...
To the country!
Captain Jackson? Mayberry of Manassas.
Listen carefully, this is top, top secret.
At precisely 7:45 tonight...
Mary had a wittle wamb.
Mustn't do that, Mr. Mayberry.
Oh, hiya Rags. Come on in. Come on.
There's no reason why we can't be friends, Rags.
Now, whats on your mind?
Come on, out with it.
Oh, I forgot.
I don't believe it. There ain't no such human.
You been spending too much time with Mr. Spelding.
I am perfectly normal.
Rags, where do you sleep at night?
Me? In a lousy box on the back porch.
They think I'm a watchdog,
but I'm really not. I'm yellow.
So am I.
Rags I have a thought. Why don't you bunk here with me tonight?
- With you?
- Sure, why not?
Oh.
Rags, you take the lower.
Normal... he says.
- Good morning, Kreton.
- Oh, good morning, Ellen.
- You look very pretty this morning.
- Thank you.
Well, how do you like it?
Your first day on Earth, I mean.
Oh! Oh that.
Just wonderful. I like it a lot.
Except that, it's not exactly like I thought it would be.
Why, what did you imagine?
Well, I'm a little disappointed, you know,
I missed the Civil War and
Gettysburg, and Shiloh, and Manassas.
You keep talking about the past, are you from the future?
Yeah, uh-huh. I can visit you at any moment in your history.
You know, time is really a trapezoid.
You know what that means, don't you?
No, I'm afraid I don't.
You don't know what a trapezoid is?
Well, I don't either, actually.
That's the trouble with school, you see, they make you memorize things that your never ever gonna use.
Kreton, what's it like in space?
Oh, it's pretty nice. Especially if you're traveling out of season.
Uh oh.
- Uh oh, trouble.
- Trouble?
Your daddy's in the study, and he's waiting for a call from
George Abercrombie in New York, and is he worried...
You mean, you can tell what daddy's thinking?
Uh huh. Would you like to listen in?
George Abercrombie, big shot executive,
thinks he has brains. Well,
I've got news for him.
His brains aren't in his head they're in his...
Oops.
You have to be awfully careful of thoughts.
Like for instance: Your thoughts. Right now.
I haven't a thing on my mind.
Except Conrad.
The truth, Ellen?
Poor Conrad, sleeping with daddy,
and if daddy knew what he was planning for this weekend at the lake
he'd strangle him in his sleep.
No chaperones.
I'm frighted...
No, I'm excited.
I'm really looking forward to...
He's inside. Kreton's inside my mind.
Kreton, stop that!
Well, Ellen, wait a minute,
I mean, well, I didn't mean to embarrass you.
Well, now you know.
Oh, Kreton, the whole thing is so mixed up.
Well, lets un-mix it.
First, how does Conrad feel about your father?
I'm afraid he doesn't like Daddy very much.
And what does your father think about Conrad?
Despises him.
Well, then the first thing we have to do is, change the sleeping arrangement.
Because last night certainly wasn't satisfactory at all.
Now, there are 3 bedrooms and I'm in one.
Now, let's put Mr. and Mrs. Spelding in bedroom A, together.
Now, you and Conrad...
Yes, this is going to work out just fine, Ellen.
You and Conrad can take over bedroom B.
But, Conrad and I, aren't married.
Well, I didn't mean any harm by it, Ellen.
You have to understand that, well, you see, where I come from, we don't tangle.
You don't tangle?
Oh no, we haven't done that for a long time.
Well, if you don't tangle...
What do you do?
I mean, how do you multiply?
Multiply what?
Each other. How do you have babies?
- Oh we don't.
- I don't understand.
Well, let me explain, Ellen.
You see, we have ourselves.
And, well, since we're for real, forever.
Well, there's enough of us.
Do you understand?
So now you... never tangle.
No, never. It's a lost art.
Although I must admit we were a little hasty. I think.
But, anyway, you must promise me that you'll let me watch, the next time you and
Conrad oscillate antennas.
Oscillate antennas?
Oh, I'm sorry. Well, that's what they call it on Venus, but down here I believe they refer to it as " pitch and woo."
May I watch?
Well, Ellen, what did I say now?
That's really the one thing
I wanna see while I'm down here.
Kreton, you've got to stop talking like that.
I know that you're from another planet and all,
I guess we do think an awful lot about sex down here.
But we're not supposed to discuss it.
Anyway, it only happens when nobody's looking.
Morning, Conrad.
Did you sleep well?
I was up all night...
Ell...
Ellen, your father grinds his teeth.
It's just gruesome.
He's been listening to my mind.
Huh?
I know all about the weekend at the lake.
No chaperone.
Yeah, how 'bout that?
How'd he find out?
I just told you. I was thinking about you, and Kreton saw it in my mind.
Guess who I'm thinking about right this minute peach blossom.
So that's how you Earthlings do it, huh?
Very interesting. Very interesting, indeed.
Well, I'm pretty well straightened away except for one little detail.
A teensy-winsy thing
I'm still not too sure of.
- Which one has the baby?
- Kreton!
Conrad, go get the car, we'll be late for class.
Ahh, in a minute.
I got to go out to the barn and give Myrtle her breakfast.
I'll take her a corn flakes box.
I'll pick you up in a few minutes honey child.
Corn flake box?
This seems much more nourishing.
I do believe he thinks more of that goat than he does of me.
What a weekend.
I can just see her gorgeous figure in that bathing suit.
Wow-wee!
Well, you're the one alright.
Nobody ever whistled at a goat in a bathing suit.
Except another goat I guess.
Oh, there you are.
If you're not busy, Mr. Kreton, my husband would see you in the study.
Oh, gladly.
What are you laughing at dear?
Conrad's goat in a bathing suit.
Oh? Did he buy her a bathing suit?
I didn't know she could swim.
Why don't you hang a red light on that thing, it's a menace to navigation.
- Good morning, my boy.
- Good morning, sir.
I need your advice.
I just spoke to New York...
I know. You spoke to George Abercrombie, and he's on his way here, he's arriving on the 11 o'clock plane.
How did you...? Oh...
You know what I'm thinking.
Uh huh, and right now you're pretty worried, aren't you?
Of course I'm worried.
That fellow's my boss.
Hires and fires, fires and hires, all day long.
Why did I do that? I never drink before breakfast.
A drink what? What is that?
- Bourbon.
- Bourbon? May I try?
I'm afraid you're a little young my boy.
Young? Here's my driver's license. See?
I'm over 21 .
21 million light years?
Yes, you should have seen my birthday cake with all the candles.
Burned it to a crisp.
I'd be careful... on an empty stomach.
Really? Then should be a lotta fun.
Mr. Delton, are you gonna' let him try that stuff?
I am indeed. It'll teach him a lesson.
Give that lad enough cloud and he'll hang himself.
Good, good.
Wow, that sure was powerful stuff.
Thank you very much.
Now, now, you can talk later.
Time for breakfast.
Ellen and Conrad want to drive
Mr. Kreton into town with them.
Do you like your bacon crisp Mr. Kreton?
Yes, that'll be fine.
Good. You shouldn't be up there, you know.
You'll get footprints all over the ceiling.
Oh, by the way, you can make my eggs, sunny side down.
Now that's silly.
Now I know what they mean by "being high".
Let's have another one.
Well, I'm beginning to understand how they do things here on Earth.
When Conrad tickles your ear, that makes the motor go, right?
Conrad, tickling my ear, has nothing to do with the motor.
It has to do with your motor?
You oughta try it sometime.
Love... it's wonderful.
Oh, well, we gave up ages ago.
It took us darn near forever to stamp out disease.
Scarlet fever, mumps, anxiety, the common cold and finally, that great killer: Passion.
You gave up passion?
Oh yeah, we don't feel anything.
We don't do anything.
Inside we're sort of like... cold spaghetti, you know?
- Sounds terribly dull.
- Well, it is, a little.
You go right ahead, Conrad.
Don't mind me.
Oh, I'm sorry, I was watching.
Unless we get moving soon we're going to be late.
Kreton, you did that. How'd you ever do it?
Very simple. I just thought him into the air.
The next policeman is yours.
- Oh, may I?
- Sure!
- Hey, this is fun.
- Oh, it sure is.
- Oh, is this is one mine?
- Be my guest.
- Oh no.
- What do I do?
Well, just focus all your thoughts on that policeman.
- Ellen, please.
- Conrad, watch this.
Nothing happened.
That's because you're not concentrating, Ellen.
Now, concentrate. Lift the cop.
Lift the cop.
Conrad! I did it! He moved!
He really moved!
That was wonderful, Ellen.
Tomorrow I'll teach you to lift buildings.
Isn't this fun?
Hey!
Would you kindly stop flirting with my girl?
Well, I didn't mean any harm, Conrad.
Inside, cold spaghetti, remember?
Cold spaghetti nothing.
You got a hot chile look in your eye!
Look, look, here he comes.
You'll probably wind up in jail.
Oh, we can't do that. It would spoil our whole day.
Uh, watch him. I'll give him an 8 the easy way.
You know your way back home, don't you fella?
Well, I found my way to the Earth didn't I?
That's a lot easier than finding your way out of a turnpike.
Oh.
Well... thanks for the car, Conrad.
I'll be careful.
These turnpikes are murder. Ain't they bud?
Oh, they're not so bad, just follow me.
Flash! Ladies and gentlemen,
the most remarkable event in the history of Virginia
has just occurred in Manassas.
At exactly 9:37 am,
at the Richmond interchange...
Mary had a wittle wamb.
Its fleece was white as snow
and everywhere that Mary went
the wamb was sure to go.
Hi Clementine.
Oh, hi honey. Well, how are you?
Now what's this all about?
Everyday the same old routine.
And I'm getting pretty tired of it.
Here he comes, the terror of Manassas.
Here, here now neighbors should be friends.
Now, I want you two to shake hands.
I positively refuse!
Right in the eye. You call her a lady?
Alright now stop this bickering and I'm not leaving here until you two kiss and make up.
I won't kiss him but he can kiss me.
There, now that wasn't so terrible was it?
Dames, she really loves it.
Mrs. Spelding...
Shh! I'm eavesdropping.
Roger's been in there listening to Mr Abercrombie for almost an hour.
I don't like that Ambercrombie.
I'm sure Roger's going to lose his job.
Don't you worry about that Mrs Spelding.
We're fraternity brothers!
You've made a few mistakes too many old man.
George, if you're saying...
I'm saying that viewer wise, sponsor wise, information wise.
You, Spelding, are low man on the totem pole.
The flag is down the lifeboats are gone and the ship is sinking.
- And I'm the captain?
- But not for long.
You're going down for the third time.
Who's this joker?
Kreton? Oh, he's a visitor here.
Last night about 7 o'clock
Mary had a wittle wamb its fleece was white as...
Spelding! Are you in your second childhood?
Yes sir, there's no other explanation.
Abercrombie, I've been looking forward to meeting you for a long time.
You've always been A-1 on my ship ever since the lifeboat went up the totem pole.
I beg your pardon?
What I mean to say man is you're the talk of Madison Avenue.
Oh? Oh well... aren't you exaggerating a trifle?
Not a bit. How about that humdinger of a deal you pulled on.
BB. DD. JJ. And W, huh?
You really gave them the old stabbed in the back. Knife wise.
I really pulled a fast one there didn't I.
Wait a minute.
Nobody knew about the BB, DD,
JJ, and W deal, not even W.
How did you find out?
Well don't tell me. From my wife.
No! Eloise.
Shh! Nobody knows about Eloise.
Not even your wife.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
He's sure.
Oh, good good.
You see when a man has a wife like mine and Eloise, like Eloise.
Well, he can get in an awful mess.
Would you pardon me, I want to get some more ice.
Sure.
What's he thinking about?
Am I going to lose my job?
Very important to get rid of Spelding.
I'm sunk.
Oh no you're not.
Oh, eh, Spelding.
I suggest we let this simmer in the pot for a while.
And about that BB, DD, JJ, and W business.
And... Eloise.
This is strictly "entre nous" of course.
Oh, of course.
I won't say a word.
No, not as long as you still have your job eh, Mr Spelding.
Oh I get it, blackmail!
It's not bad... blackmail.
No, I use it all the time myself.
You've got quite a future in the advertising game young man.
Cheerio.
- Goodbye George.
- Oh, goodbye Rheba.
Remember me to your charming wife.
Oh, yes of course.
Thanks, my boy. You saved my neck.
Well, I don't like him.
How'd everything go dear?
Fine, just fine, thanks to our young friend here.
He really straightened old George out.
Glad to have been of service, sir.
Aah. What a great son-in-law he'd make.
- You mean instead of Conrad?
- I certainly do.
Well, I don't know... Sputniks, for grandchildren but I don't think parents should interfere, mine didn't or I wouldn't be Mrs.
Roger Putnam-Spelding, would I dear?
Conrad, you know what I think we oughta do tonight?
- Get married?
- No, silly.
I think we should take
Kreton to the "Hungry Brain."
- He might enjoy it.
- I wouldn't enjoy it.
Not with him.
- You're jealous.
- I can't help it.
Baby doll, marry me.
Darling, I can't. Daddy would be furious.
If your daddy thought it would get me out of his bedroom tonight he'd forge the wedding license.
Darling, I just can't marry you.
You're sweet, but maybe what I really want, what I really need, is someone who'd drag me around be the hair.
Oh, you started. Good.
Oh don't mind me,
I won't make a sound.
I'll just sit back here and take notes.
You go right ahead.
Kreton, we went all through that this morning.
It's not polite to snoop on people.
That's right mister.
Well, I didn't mean any harm. I'm sorry.
Kreton, Conrad and I have decided to take you out tonight.
You decided..
We decided.
No we didn't.
Yes we did!
Well, I'm not going!
Then we'll go alone!
Mister, I don't approve of my girl going out with strange men.
Kreton is not strange!
They don't come any stranger!
Kreton, you and I are going to The Hungry Brain tonight.
Oh wonderful!
What is it?
Well, it's our favorite rendezvous.
And it's out of this world.
Out of this world? I'd better dress for it.
Well, here we are.
On the moon?
On the moon! No.
No Ellen, The Hungry Brain.
Come on dear.
What's the matter Ellen, you're trembling. Did I drive too fast for you?
No, it's just that I never cross the river before without using the bridge.
Kreton, don't you know what bridges are for?
Yeah, to shade the fish.
Mr. Mayberry.
Thank you!
Let's go.
Man, now that's out.
That's so out, he ain't ever been in.
Well, real old fashioned music.
I think this is going to be fun.
- Good evening, Miss. Spelding.
- Good evening.
Right this way, please.
This cat must be our new leader.
Well, if he ain't, let's elect him.
Crazy. He's a real kook.
Hey kook!
Like uh... who's the new member?
I don't know baby but he sure looks cool.
Welcome to inner space brother.
Oh, thank you.
Say, that's a real crazy looking pair of jeans you have dad.
Who laid the threads on you?
Jeans? Threads?
Like who's your tailor, baby, and where can we find him?
Oh, my tailor. Well, do you know where the Milky Way is?
Yeah the...
The Milky Way.
Yeah, yeah the Milky Way. Go baby wail.
Well, you turn right at the second nebula and it's the third planet at the end of the star cluster.
You just ask for Mr. De Milo and tell him I sent ya'.
Man this cat talks off the top.
He's tuned in.
Tell me double hipness.
What floor do you get out of when you split from the cloud.
Oh, we don't use floors.
You don't use floors?
Oh no, we use fog.
It's much softer and far easier to keep clean.
Quite a group aren't they?
Oh yes they are.
Except I'm a little curious
Ellen, tell me one thing...
What are they: Animal, mineral or vegetable?
There people silly. Beatniks.
Man, what we're trying to find out is, where you planted here or did you come in on the beam?
He wants to know where you come from?
Perhaps you'd rather not tell.
Oh no, I don't mind. I'm sure they won't say anything.
Oh I'm sorry.
I come from X-47.
I live right near that tailor I told you about.
Out past the Milky Way.
Out... past... The Milky Way.
Past.
Oh man, this cat's really from out of town.
Alright boys take five.
Hey man, we've been watching you from the bandstand.
Oh really?
Yeah, you look out enough to make it.
Would you dig wailing with the group?
Oh well, thank you, but I'm not a musician.
Although, I think
I would like to play those.
- The skins?
- Skins?
The bongos man!
Oh yeah, the bongos, yeah.
Crazy, let's make it.
Like now let's split.
Well, if it's all the same to you,
I think I'd like to play them from here.
You want to play those... from there?
Yeah.
Kreton, how did you do that?
Oh, uh...
Well, it's quite simple, see, many, many different...
This is a very sad story.
You see, it's all about a girl who fell in love with a no good rat nick, and it's very touching actually.
Cuckoo!
A little kids a drop deserted her.
Oh my god. Why?
Cuckoo!
Oh, I'll be alright.
It was a lovely number. Too bad she left out the best part.
What part did she leave out?
The part... where her father makes it like he... he doesn't know he did...
Kreton, now come on.
I get all chocked up when I hear...
Do you mind if I borrow your man?
No, I won't.
Life's a drag daddy-o.
Let's make it.
Oh, well, thank you, but I'm with her.
No daddy-o, you're with "it".
Come on, honey.
Buzz over to my "hive".
Just watch my hand closely.
Nooo, you're watching too hard.
- Just cool it, man, cool it.
- Cool it.
Yeah.
- There we go.
- Crazy.
Mr. Delton should see me now.
I can young man. I see you very well.
Kreton, you were just wonderful.
Oh, it wasn't anything.
You know, sometimes you do things and you're not really aware of what’s going on because your just doing...
Ellen, what are you doing under the table?
- I've had it!
- This is ridiculous.
Shave my beard and call me normal!
Let's go!
Oh I didn't mean it!
Don't be scared!
I didn't...
Wait a minute. I...
Kreton, will you come down from there?
I'm sorry, Ellen, I guess Mr. Delton saw more than I figured.
Say, what are those cars doing over there?
That's inspiration point.
Don't they have a lover's Lane where you come from?
Oh no. We gave that up a long time ago.
Along with mahjong and community singing.
Would you like to go over and... park for a while?
Yeah, that might be interesting.
Hey, kill the lights!
Turn them off!
Turn those lights down!
Turn those lights down!
Turn off those lights.
It seems pretty dull to me.
They're just sitting there and they're not even talking.
The reason they're not talking is because they're cuddling.
Look at that gorgeous moon.
Doesn't the moon mean anything to you?
Of course.
Last stop for gas before Mars.
The moon Kreton, spells romance.
That boy and that girl they're kissing.
The moon did that.
Well now?
Is kissing really fun?
Why don't you try it and find out?
That's a splendid idea.
I'll run over and ask them.
Kreton, there's no need to make such a long trip.
Stay here.
I believe I will try it.
It is sanitary but it isn't as much fun.
I'd better get rid of that old barrier.
Oh, I like that.
You know something?
We're going to do that again.
That's what he thinks.
Kreton this will never do, there isn't any "oomph".
On the contrary, I felt a definite ping in my left vertebrae.
Let's have another whirl at it.
Great.
- Oh boy.
- Another ping?
And a pong and a wing ding dong.
I melted it. I melted it.
It's the real thing.
I'm in love.
Exactly as I anticipated.
- He's become an Earthling.
- Oh, what a wonderful feeling, Ellen.
He asked for it and I'm afraid he's going to get it.
- What was that?
- I must have blown a fuse.
- Ellen, do you know why...?
- It's all my fault.
I should never have let you kiss me.
Well, Ellen, don't worry, I-I'm gonna do the right thing.
I'm gonna ask your father, for your hand in marriage.
Marriage?
For my hand in...?
Kreton, do you realize what you're saying?
Well of course I realize, Ellen.
And all the time you thought was a cad.
Well, coming up?
No, I think I'll go get some hot milk, or cold milk or something.
I'll see you in the morning, Kreton.
Happy, Ellen?
Well, not exactly happy. I'm more...
More ecstatic. Yeah, me too.
I'm floating on air.
I heard that outer-space carpetbagger.
You're not going to marry him.
- Are you?
- Of course not, darling.
I just don't want to hurt his feelings.
What about my feelings. I'm human, too.
What do I mean "too", he's not human.
Lord knows what he is.
Well, whatever he is, Kreton is kind and sweet and nice.
Oh Conrad, what am I going to do?
You're gonna marry me, that's what you're gonna do.
- We're going to elope.
- Oh, Conrad.
Just as soon as I finish this sandwich.
You know Rags? Ellen and I are really meant for each other.
It's really true love.
I know Ellen and I are from different worlds, but that shouldn't be an obstacle.
Personally, I don't believe in mixed marriages.
- Look at me.
- Why, you look just fine.
Fine? My mother was a Mexican chihuahua and my father, a Labrador retriever.
How'd you like to walk around with a warm nose and a cold tail.
Oh Rags, goodnight.
That poor earthling, Conrad.
He thinks he's going to elope with Ellen.
But I know better.
That's what he thinks.
And you know what's funny, Rags?
Mr. Delton doesn't have the slightest idea about what's going on.
That's what he thinks.
Mr. Delton thinks that falling in love will get me into trouble.
That's what he thinks, boy is he wrong.
That's what he thinks.
Good morning, dear.
Young ones not down yet?
Kreton, Conrad, breakfast is ready.
- Where's Ellen?
- I don't know.
She wasn't in bed when
I woke up this morning.
Neither was Conrad when I woke... up...
They both must have had early classes today.
- Good morning, Mr. Spelding.
- Good morning, my boy.
- Well, you're in a good mood I see.
- Oh, never better.
Listen to this:
"The Amalgamated Television
Network today renewed."
"Roger Putnam Spelding's contract for another 5 years."
It's your work my boy.
I want you to know that I'm deeply grateful.
Well, don't mention it...
- Dad.
- Dad?
- Well, Mr. Spelding...
- Yes?
You see, there comes a time in every spaceman's life, when he finally meets the girl of his clouds.
Now, you see sir, I've put away enough blue dingles not only to support...
Roger, Mr. Kreton, come quickly.
This is actually the uh... point I'm uh... trying to make Mr. Spelding uh...
You see, Mr. Spelding... oh.
Now what is it?
- The most wonderful thing has happened.
- What happened?
They married. Conrad and Ellen are husband and wife.
- Husband and wife?
- They did elope.
- You see, dad...
- Dad!?!
Mr. Spelding, we just had to get married.
What do you mean "had to?"
Well, I mean we couldn't wait another minute. Not with him around.
- So we eloped.
- Eloped you, you, you...
- Goat herder you.
- Ellen!
Daddy please!
- I don't know why you but I...
- We thought of this...
Don't get upset, Mr. Spelding,
I guess the best man won.
- Now wait a minute.
- Excuse me dear.
I don't believe the children have had breakfast.
- Conrad, you will stay.
- I'll be happy to.
Congratulations, old man,
I hope we can still be friends.
You mean you don't feel
"that way" about Ellen?
Oh, she's like a sister to me.
A sister, eh, Kreton?
Well, I'll just show them how you really feel about her.
Ellen oh, Ellen, you babe with that crazy build.
I've been watching you shake it around this house
and you’ve been watching me watching you and it's driving me mad.
Wow!
Kreton, what are you saying?
I do not know, someone unzipped my mind.
Mr. Delton. Please.
We don't need words honey, not you and me.
The first time I saw you, bells rang,
the earth moved.
It was like there was nobody else in the world.
Just you and me, and the black burning nights,
exploding like a thousand roman candles.
I propose, mister, that you discontinue this line of thought at once.
No, no, it's fascinating, really.
But Ellen, I didn't mean a word of it.
- That is I, I meant it, but...
- What?
No I didn't mean to say it.
Actually, Ellen, I...
And your hungry eyes, begging me, imploring me and pleading with me,
to take you in my powerful arms.
Wow.
Ellen look, actually this is whole...
Mister the woman you love happens to be my wife.
- Conrad, please.
- Wait just easy honey. Barrier nothing...
Conrad... go ahead.
Conrad!
Get up.
Let him have it, Kreton.
Just bop him one.
There will be no bopping.
Stand still.
It's stuck, Mr. Delton, please, it won't hit.
- Mine won't hit.
- Hit me.
- Mine don't hit.
- Conrad, now stop it.
Mine don't hit.
- What's the matter, you a coward?
- That's it, yeah.
Fight!
Daddy do something.
With pleasure.
It don't hit. It's... I'd fight if I could hit.
- Conrad, now please.
- Well he started it.
What's going on? What's happening in here?
What are you all standing around for?
What are you so excited about? Whats???
What's he doing down there?
I'm hanging up the phone.
I hit him.
You... you hit him and you aren't disintegrated?
I can't understand it. The boy's lost his power.
Lost his power?
Then I'm safe. I can do my duty.
Oh this is a day.
Haven't you time for a cup of coffee, Bob?
No, no, not now. Keep him cornered Conrad.
I'll get the state police right away.
The National Guard.
The commander general of the area.
Excuse me.
Take it easy, boy, take it easy.
We'll get you up.
We'll get you up out of there, come on, up we go.
There... there there there.
- I said if you got up I'd hit him again.
- Oh now look...
Let me at him. They don't call me the Manassas mauler for nothing.
- Shut up.
- Well, I didn't mean anything...
- Are you alright?
- Oh yes, I'm fine. Thank you.
Just wet. You see, where I come from we don't feel pain.
Oh, we feel wet. You'll feel wet water...
But you don't feel pain.
Like for instance...
That's what he thinks.
I didn't even feel the slightest twinge of...
Pain!
- What is it?
- Oh my arms. Mr. Delton.
You wanted to be an earthling, my boy, so take everything that goes with it.
Oh, the leg. Just kick the leg, there's a pain.
Oh, the back is a pain.
There's a head... there's a stomach.
Oh, the foot is a pain...
Oh! No more pain!
Mabel is using the phone gotta use your...
What you...? After him.
Don't let him get away.
- He's gonna kill me.
- Well... Ah!
Come back and fight like a man.
You fight your way, I'll fight mine.
Come on, open up.
Come out and fight.
I won't come out and I won't fight.
Come on open up, you coward.
That's why I won't come out,
I'm a coward. That's it.
A spaceman, general.
S-p-a-s-e. I mean: C.
Yes, the state police are on their way now, sir.
Oh, good, good. I hope you can make it, sir.
Where's a gun?
- Oh Conrad.
- There's a gun.
Conrad, deserting your post of duty?
I need this in case he tries to break out.
Give me that, it's just a conversation piece any...
Sure talks loud, don't it?
Oh, the police.
Excuse me, I better go make sandwiches and coffee.
Come on, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Let's get out there. Come on.
Well, after you folks. After you.
I'll stay in back so
I can plan our strategy.
Watch it. Watch it, he's in there.
He's in there men. He's in there.
He's in there.
Careful now. He may be dangerous.
He's jet propelled.
No he ain't, it's Myrtle. Myrtle did it.
Myrtle you come back here.
Whoa!
Alright, out of here.
Out of here. You might get hurt.
I am hurt.
All right men, grab a line get moving.
Let's go.
Loudspeaker.
Alright mister, we've got you covered.
I said, we've got you covered.
- Pardon me.
- Certainly.
Myrtle, here Myrtle. Where did you go to?
Come to papa, you hear?
Give me that!
You haven't got a chance.
Come out with your hands over your head..
I said, come out with your hands over your head.
- Sorry I took so long, dear.
- Rheba.
- Ellen?
- No thank you.
Come out with your hands over your head.
Officer, egg salad or tuna fish sandwiches?
Please, ma'am, not now.
Conrad?
We mean business, if you don't come out we'll have to use the teargas.
Tear gas. That's a good idea.
Pardon me.
There he is men. Watch him.
Keep your eyes on him.
The wind must have changed.
It's backfiring.
Watch yourself.
Put the women in the cars!
Roll up the windows!
Roll them up fast!
Myrtle.
Myrtle.
Myrtle.
Myrtle.
I can still fly. I can still fl... yow.
Come down out of that barn, mister.
I am out.
I'm going in.
The general doesn't want us to rush the place until he gets here.
He's on the way with a Life photographer.
You naughty spaceship, you shouldn't go away without me.
Wait, wait, slow down. Slow down, your gonna get me s... ohh.
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry. Hello, Mr. Delton.
It's your ship.
Had enough, young man?
Oh, yes indeed. Yes sir. I've had it.
Well, you always wanted to be an Earthling and now you know what it's like.
You felt the pain of love, the pain of jealousy...
And the pain of pain. And that is the worst pain.
This is a crazy mixed up planet,
Mr. Delton. I'd like to get out of here.
And you'll never come back again?
Never. I promise. The furthest
I'll never go is the moon.
You've learnt a good lesson, my boy.
Remember, the grass is always greener on the other side of the universe.
So keep your nose out of other people's planets.
And from now on, I will.
Sorry, Mr. Delton, I hit my...
- Mr. Mayberry?
- Sir.
Wheres that spaceman?
Spaceman, General? There ain't no such animal.
So long, Earth. It's been lots of...
Mr. Delton.
Oh, Mr. Delton!
Mr. Delton help.
Help! Mr. Delton!
Help me!
- Good evening, Sergeant.
- Good evening, Dr Hassler.
- File 7842.
- Authority, please.
Thank you.
(beeping)
Your pen, Dr Hassler.
(beeping stops)
Sorry, Sergeant.
Oh, well.
Now my plan is ruined.
See, this is not a pen at all, it's a secret camera.
Well, better luck next time, Doctor.
Vault nine.
Thank you, Sergeant.
Now, we shall see.
My mistake.
You were right. I'm sorry.
That's all right, Doctor.
All right.
(air hisses)
- Cigar?
- That's premature. You haven't won yet.
- Do you wanna bet?
- Yeah.
Three thousand million pounds.
- All right?
- Everything's fine.
One minute to go.
Last as usual.
He's only got a hundred yards to walk.
Security, Lisa.
Scrambling operative.
(muttering)
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen, please.
The 67th meeting of the European Space
Exploration Council is now in session.
This is a momentous occasion for our organisation.
Sun Probe One was an unqualified success.
We had some spectacular results.
However, this meeting is called to consider one single result, startling in its implications.
Dr John Kane, the project director.
Gentlemen, an unmanned satellite is naturally limited in the transmission of information.
Part of the sun probe's equipment was a cine camera set to take one picture a minute for the duration of the flight.
Roll the film, please.
The far side of the sun, over 100 million miles from Earth, hidden from the eyes of radio telescopes by the sun itself.
At this point, a strange thing happened.
The gyro mechanisms aboard were influenced by another magnetic field and the capsule slowly started to rotate.
If you watch your screens carefully, you'll see that the cine camera was panned off the sun towards the force that was attracting it.
That force, gentlemen, was the gravitational pull of another planet.
I'll hold the film to show you the first complete photographic evidence of a new planet.
Hold and zoom.
A new planet in our solar system.
Thank you. Photographic evidence is only part of the story.
Instruments aboard the capsule report it is in the same orbit as Earth, but directly on the opposite side of the sun.
Orbital speed precisely the same as ours is the reason it has remained undetected.
What information do we have
from ther systems n board?
Not enough.
Which brings me to the purpose of this meeting - a proposal from the chair that we should mount a manned flight to the new planet.
Lisa, book me a scrambled satellite call to NASA headquarters at the end of this meeting, please.
- It's already in hand, David.
- How come?
- Instructions from Jason Webb.
- Oh. Thanks.
Well, Jason, how much is it gonna cost us this time?
- (man) A point f rder, Mr Chairman.
- Another one?
Mr Chairman will agree, will he not,
that all delegates are entitled
to share in EUROSEC information.
Correct.
Then perhaps the chairman
will share with us
his estimate f the cost of this manned expedition.
A realistic estimate, gentlemen - three thousand million pounds sterling.
(muttering)
Mr Chairman, I'm sure I'm speaking
for the whole f the community
when I say that
such a sum is ut f the question.
Trust a German to louse it up!
They lecture us on penny-pinching economics.
The French are only too glad to agree with them.
The rest of the community goes whichever way the wind blows.
America's our only hope.
If they contribute, the rest might follow.
Face it, Jason, we've had it.
Had what?
This is only a temporary setback.
Did you see Poulson's face when you pitched the price?
- No, I didn't.
- I did. And he's not gonna buy it.
- He'll buy it.
- For God's sake.
(buzzer)
- Yes?
- David Poulson n the internal.
Are you free to see him?
- Send him right up.
- Yes, sir.
You're gonna sit there and watch me take a man for one billion dollars.
The words of an egotistical megalomaniac.
Maniac?
Remind me to be as charitable to you when one of your rockets blows up on the pad.
(beeping)
Hadn't you better attend to that cardiac warning?
(beeping)
Just a minute.
I'll make a deal with you.
You stick to the science.
- Let me handle the politics.
- I'll accept that deal.
I'll stick to the science
if you handle the politics.
Hello, John.
Hi, Jason.
Hello, David.
- Scotch?
- Thanks, don't mind if I do. Straight.
All right.
Now, why don't you give it to me - straight?
Well, as you know, the United States has always cooperated with EUROSEC.
- But in this case, we feel...
- I said straight!
OK, Jason.
It's no go.
We discover a new planet in our own solar system, with military and scientific implications beyond comprehension.
We ask our friends for a few dollars and it's "no go".
- One billion dollars, Jason.
- Cheap at twice the price.
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes. Give it to Jason tonight.
(Jason) Delay could be dangerous.
No, thanks.
- You don't want anyone else to get there.
- How could they?
We have sole access to the information.
Who else would know the planet existed?
You know perfectly well that we have a security leak.
Well, we all have our problems.
I see.
I get the message.
Look, I know how you feel about this project, Jason. But the answer is no.
- I'm sorry. I really am.
- So am I.
Miss Kirby!
I'm going home now.
Tell Neuman and Lisa
I want to see them at 7:30.
Yes, Mr Webb. Oh, and John Kane asked me to give you this.
(doorbell)
Come in.
I want a rundown on the current security position.
- Defensively?
- Hm.
We've housed all findings and visual data from Sun Probe One in vault two.
- Access?
- Restricted.
- To whom?
- Yourself, John Kane and Mark.
And offensively?
I've reported the near certainty of a security leak.
And so?
We picked up radio signals this morning. And got a bearing.
Why not a fix?
Listen, that information is coded and radioed out in a two-second transmission.
Hm.
And there are 86,400 seconds in a day.
All right.
You made your point.
- But when are you gonna nail him?
- What?
When are you going to nail him?
- It depends how much rope we give him.
- All right.
Lisa, that access restriction must be widened.
- To whom?
- Hassler.
Dr Hassler.
You're serving up information on a plate to our prime suspect?
That's my responsibility.
Your responsibility is this - if he shows his hand,
I don't want an arrest.
Understood?
Understood.
(clatter)
(beeping)
(beeping slows)
(flatline beep)
- Has any information been transmitted?
- He wasn't broadcasting record requests.
So the existence of a new planet could be known outside Europe and the States.
I'm afraid so.
Preparations for a manned flight could be under way by somebody else.
Don't panic.
It would take some time.
We'd have to check your information, examine Hassler's body, see the transmissions you monitored, check the manufacturing origins of his photographic equipment.
Arrange all that for Mr Poulson immediately.
- And put John Kane in the picture.
- Right.
Could I have a look at the photographic equipment?
Sure.
Does our side have anything like this?
We have now.
Oh, Mark.
Give that back to Kane, will you?
Tell him I accept his apologies.
Right.
So... you're convinced now there has been a leak?
- Yes. And I'm left with no choice.
- I agree.
It'll be up to you to persuade the rest of the community.
But you'd be prepared to recommend that the United States should contribute one billion dollars to a manned flight conducted by EUROSEC?
- Yes. Full information sharing.
- Guaranteed.
By you?
What else do you suggest?
Putting an American astronaut on the team.
- Who?
- I've already called Cape Kennedy.
They suggested our most experienced.
50 days of space flight, two manned projects to Mars...
Glenn Ross?
(PA) The passenger from NASA flight 155
will arrive at gate seven.
Thank you.
(man) Hold it, Mrs Ross.
Thank you, Colonel.
- I'm Jason Webb. Welcome to EUROSEC.
- Glenn Ross. My wife Sharon.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- This is Lisa Hartmann, security.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- Miss Hartmann.
Dr John Kane, project director.
Hello.
Delighted to meet you.
Paulo Landi, public relations.
He'll be looking after both of you.
- How do you do, Mrs Ross?
- Hello.
I'll have a Scotch, please.
- What's on your mind?
- I've been thinking, John.
About the second astronaut to accompany Ross.
Well, Borgner is the obvious choice.
Or Mitchell.
- If we want just an astronaut, I agree.
- But?
It occurs to me we need someone more flexible.
- Well, they're trained to...
- I mean in terms of knowledge.
Someone who could take full advantage of any findings on the new planet, however bizarre and unusual they happen to be.
You mean an astrophysicist?
- Me?
- The idea doesn't appeal to you?
- You must be joking.
- It'll grow on you.
Well, there she is.
Fourth gantry.
We've been developing a lift body for controlled landings.
If analysis confirms an atmosphere on the new planet, we use that as the last stage.
Without seeming too eager, when does training start?
Tomorrow.
I can hardly wait.
(heartbeat)
(man) 400.
- Fire retros.
- Hold it.
- Jason!
- What are you trying to do? Kill him?
- Now!
- Retros!
(yelps)
- Are you OK, John?
- (weakly) OK.
Yes, I'm OK.
Hi.
Didn't know you'd be back.
You're late.
We... drove into Lisbon to see the cathedral and then stopped over for dinner.
Oh!
I could sleep for a week.
(running water)
- I had my first medical today.
- Did you? How did it go?
Doctors say everything's all right as usual.
Good.
Everything's all right.
We're not starting that one again, are we?
Look, face it, Glenn.
It's your job.
You're up in space hundreds of days.
You're subjected to radiation effects.
That's why we can't have children.
- The doctors say different.
- They're employed by politicians.
Do you really think they'd tell even you the truth?
Great publicity.
America's top astronaut - sterile.
Your doctors don't work for politicians so it can't be you.
For God's sakes,
I'm not about to go through this again.
The brutal truth of the matter is that you went up there a man, but you came back less than a man.
Maybe this is why we're not having kids, huh?
If you have anything to say, you better say it now.
Is that how you prove your virility?
(horn beeps)
It really was the only way of attracting your attention.
- You look like a man with problems.
- I'll tell you about 'em someday.
Thank you.
(PA) Would Mr Edwards
please contact reception?
- We don't often see you at administration.
- Jason wants to see me.
How is the training going?
It's tough for me, but it's hell for John.
It's a crash course in space preparation.
Glenn, there is something
I shouldn't tell you.
- What's that?
- I know why Jason wants to see you.
- Why?
- He plans to put the launch date forward.
- Forward?
- Mm-hm.
- Well, we'll see about that.
- Good luck, Glenn.
- Lisa.
- Hm?
Thanks for the warning.
I'm forwarding the launching date four weeks.
- You're pushing too hard, Jason.
- You don't understand.
In Germany, budgetary troubles.
In France, political troubles.
Somebody will suggest withdrawing from the project any day.
You're an administrator. You know when a rocket's ready, but not a man. Kane isn't.
I know more about human nature than anybody else at EUROSEC.
That's why I'm in this office.
And I'm telling you,
Kane will make it.
And I'm telling you he won't.
- Where do we go from here?
- There are other American astronauts.
That's right.
You'd be right back to zero again.
Nevertheless,
I am informing you officially that the launching date will be brought forward... two weeks.
Two weeks.
(buzzer)
- Now?
- Now.
My instincts tell me there's a little bit of transportation around here somewhere.
- Don't the rules say we walk?
- Sure.
- What's it like up there?
- Where?
There.
Lonely.
How lonely?
Same as down here.
No different.
You mean you've got to have someone with you down here up there?
It's got to be the right person, though, or it makes no difference.
No difference.
- Home again.
- Yeah.
This is the part we have to make look good. We're back uncomfortably early.
- I could grow attached to them.
- That's the idea.
Now you can be hooked up to the heart, lung and kidney machine during flight.
With sedation you will sleep for three weeks there... and three weeks back.
That part I'm looking forward to.

(beeping)
Good morning.
Bang on target.
Clouds. There are clouds, Glenn.
So there is an atmosphere.
All right. Preliminary orbit 34,000 miles from planet's surface as planned, right?
Right.
OK, two orbits to mark out electronic survey, then we decide... to land or not to land.
(beeping)
(beeping)
Well, let's have it.
Mass and gravitational pull similar to Earth.
There's an atmosphere.
Oxygen present.
- Suitable landing site?
- Established.
Seascape and vegetation.
So far no sign of life.
All right, mate.
What's the next move?
Well, like you said - to land or not to land.
This is one we can't put through the computer. What do you think?
I think, on the result of the survey, we don't have a choice.
- You?
- I'm for go.
Let's go, then.
Landing orbit coming up.
(hissing)
Cabin pressure zero.
Ready for transfer to landing lift body.
- 30 seconds.
- OK.
The on-board computer should take us within five miles of the landing site.
Ten seconds. If we have any trouble with the guidance system, give me manual.
- Check.
- Here we go.

Vertical jets, full flaps.
(harsh metallic voice)
(harsh metallic voice)
Do you speak English?
I'm air-sea rescue,
Ulan Bator.
(harsh metallic voice) I will get your friend.
(speaks Mongolian)
- Well?
- Results of the electronic medical check.
He's in pretty good shape.
But the readouts on items 20, 27 and 32 don't make sense.
They certainly don't.
Check the computer.
- It was checked out this morning.
- Then check it out again.
Never trust them.
- Any improvement?
- No.
- Has he spoken?
- Disjointedly.
It's impossible to make out a meaning.
Arrange for anything he says to be recorded.
Mark, I want a total security blackout on news of their return until we find out what the devil's gone wrong.
What about that Mongolian rescue team?
I called my opposite number in the
Soviet Academy of Space Science.
- They've agreed to cooperate.
- Does the clampdown include Mrs Ross?
No, tell her to stand by.
Pontini.
No one except authorised personnel are to see any results until all computers have been completely rechecked.
- You're responsible.
- It's my department.
- Well?
- Dr Kane is still unconscious.
- And Colonel Ross?
- Apart from the shock and superficial...
Is he fit? I don't want details,
I only want to know one thing.
- Is he fit for questioning?
- Yes.
- Do I have to go through with this?
- It's your job.
Before we start, this is the interrogation room, not debriefing.
That's right.
Sit down, please.
- (Mark) Why did you turn back?
- We did not turn back.
- You claim you completed your mission?
- We reached the new planet, yes.
You agree that to fly there and return takes six weeks?
Yes.
You accept that you have returned three weeks after launching?
Well, I can't explain that.
All I can say is...
- You completed the electronic survey?
- Yes.
Of the new planet?
- Yes.
- And returned to Earth?
- We crashed.
- On Earth?
- On the planet.
- You're here! On Earth!
To the planet and back in three weeks?
- I don't know. There's a lot I can't explain.
- (Mark) You left Earth.
Three weeks later you return - crashed.
It takes six weeks to travel to the new planet and return.
You were gone three weeks.
So you turned back!
- We did not turn back.
- Why?
Why? Why?
I'm sending Ross home.
You won't get any more out of him today.
The interrogation leaves us with two possibilities.
One - Ross aborted the mission and turned back.
If that was the case, he'd deny it for obvious reasons.
Two - Ross genuinely believes he made the journey to the new planet and is as surprised as we are that when he landed he found himself back on Earth.
This is the theory I prefer to believe.
Only one snag.
Why was there no sign of life on his electronic survey?
Well, that could be explained.
Their orbit took them over the Pacific, Atlantic and the poles.
The land they crossed is mainly uninhabited.
All right.
So we prefer the second theory.
But three weeks to the planet, three weeks back. That's six weeks in all.
- They were only away three weeks.
- That's right.
So they turned back.
It still doesn't make sense.
The world's most experienced astronaut and a leading scientist.
Why?
The Council felt railroaded into this from the start.
They'll turn like a pack of wolves now it's failed.
They don't know yet. And they won't know until I establish exactly what happened.
You can't do that without the flight recorder. And that's still on the Phoenix.
Arrangements have been made to bring that back.
When is Poulson due back from the States?
- Not till the 17th.
- Thank God for that.
- Was it rough?
- Yeah.
Glenn, what really happened?
(sighs) What do you mean?
- What made you turn back?
- We didn't turn back.
- Then it doesn't make sense.
- Right.
You're covering for John Kane, aren't you?
(sighs) No, there's nothing to cover for.
- (horn blares)
- Look out!
- What the hell are you doing?
- He was on the wrong side of the road.
It must have been rough.
I'll go make some coffee.
Sharon, what's going on?
- Sharon?
- What is it?
You know damn well what it is.
This room.
- What about the room?
- It's changed. What the hell happened?
Some disorientation isn't unusual after a protracted period in space.
I understand that, but it's never happened on any previous space flights.
Keep me informed. If things get worse,
I promise immediate action.
(smashes)
What is it?
- What's wrong?
- The writing is reversed.
Everything is reversed.
Jason Webb, please.
Jason, this is urgent.
I must see you right away.
- Excuse me, Colonel.
- Yeah, what is it?
- Over here, Colonel.
- What the hell is this all about?
Do what they say, Glenn.
- He called me.
- From where?
Our bathroom in here.
See for yourself.
- He shouldn't have been sent home.
- He could've killed me.
This does it.
I'm getting out of here.
- You don't mean that, Sharon.
- You bet I do.
What happened after he smashed the bottles?
He went crazy. He said his handwriting was reversed, my watch. Everything.
Well, look at this.
Does this look reversed to you?
- The man's gone out of his mind.
- We don't know that yet.
Well, you may not, but I do.
I'm his wife. Remember that.
He's been violent before.
- Like this?
- He hit me.
- It was the flight.
- It was before the flight.
And like I said,
I'm getting out of here.
We know about your personal life,
Mrs Ross. It's our job.
- You better forget about leaving.
- You can't stop me.
I can't stop you leaving this house, but
I can and will stop you leaving EUROSEC.
- (man) You can talk to him now.
- So everything is reversed, huh?
- Everything.
- Glenn, we're going to check a few things.
All right.
Set it up.
Now, watch the mirror, please.
- Here we go.
- Read it!
"Fire emergency checklist."
"In the event of fire priorities are assigned as follows:
Documentation, research specimens, photographic material, progress..."
All right.
Good enough for you?
What the hell more do you want?
I don't envy him.
(Lisa) You completed your mission?
- (Mark) Why did you turn back?
- (Glenn) We crashed.
(Mark) Why? Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why?
You completed your mission?
Why did you turn back?
We crashed.
Why? Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why?
Satisfied?
"Satisfied"?
That I was telling the truth about the new planet.
You're bound to be a little confused until the drug wears off.
- You're trying to check out my story, yes?
- Uh-huh.
- You couldn't fault it, right?
- No, we couldn't fault it.
You'll hear the same story from John Kane.
(muted) What happened?
Tell me!
I'm sorry I'm late.
I was detained at the medical centre.
Come and sit down. What I have to say to you is very important.
No, Jason, you sit down.
You've interrogated me, looked into my brain and found out nothing.
I want you to sit down and listen to me.
I'm listening.
Now, what I'm going to tell you is bizarre, weird, but it's the only theory that fits the facts.
I propose a complete duplication of matter - a situation where every single atom, every molecule here, is duplicated here, except that it's in reverse.
Now, when I left Earth to travel to the new planet, another man left the new planet at precisely the same time to travel to Earth.
Another Colonel Ross.
The man you know as Colonel Ross is on the other planet standing in an identical, except reversed, room, talking to an identical Jason Webb who's sitting in an identical chair rubbing his hands together at this exact moment.
Look here.
Now, what do you see?
Go on.
You see the mirrored images of Jason Webb and Glenn Ross.
There are now four people in this room - two Jason Webbs, two Glenn Rosses.
What I'm trying to say is these two planets have a physical connection.
One is the mirrored image of the other.
But, unlike the reflection in the mirror, they both exist.
For every person on one planet there is a double on the other.
Don't you understand? Until a few days ago, you and I had never met.
Are you trying to tell me that you don't know any of the people here? Your wife?
Lisa? Neuman?
- Only their doppelg鋘gers.
- Their what?
Doppelg鋘gers - doubles.
If you want a literal translation, the mirrored images of themselves.
I think I'd better get you a drink.
All right, I know how it sounds.
Can you think of anything better?
I wish to God I could.
When I got your call, Dr Pontini had just completed a postmortem on John Kane.
And?
Kane's internal organs were found to be on the opposite side from normal.
My normal, that is.
It was all there on the computer readout when you had your electronic medicals.
I assumed, wrongly, that it was a fault.
Lesson number one - never distrust a computer.
So, you see, your theory holds up.
It would seem
I'm not the Jason Webb that you know, only an impish doppelg鋘ger.
How do you do, Colonel Ross?
- It's only a theory.
- It's the best we've got.
But we can't prove it till we've recovered the Phoenix.
If we're right, your version of the Dove won't be able to dock with the Phoenix.
We'll have to reverse the controls and the electrical systems.
Or does the polarity of electricity remain the same?
Well? Does it?
If we're wrong, you do realise what would happen to you?
- It's a chance I'm willing to take.
- And the other Colonel Ross?
Are you willing to take a chance on him too?
That was a penny for your thoughts.
If they are as confused as mine, maybe sharing them would help.
Did you say a penny?
Well, it's a buyers' market.
What would you like to know?
- Sharon's left?
- Yes.
In a way, she left a long time ago.
- Are you going to recover the Phoenix?
- Yes.
With reversed vision?
How will you operate the controls?
It should be interesting.
Don't do it, Glenn.
You've done enough for Jason.
Well, it's not really just for Jason.
I don't understand.
Well, you know how it is. There's so much
I'm not supposed to talk about.
Do you mind me coming over?
No. As a matter of fact,
I'm glad you're here.
Someone to talk to.
Why did you reverse
"Doppelganger", Colonel?
It's an inside joke between me and myself.
- Good luck, sir.
- Thank you.
- Network check complete?
- All set.
Proceed condition.
Proceed condition.
This is EUROSEC Launch Control.
Phoenix on horizon.
- Liftoff eight seconds.

(man) Procedures check.
All systems go.
Roger.
You couldn't stay away, hm?
Launch Control, this is Doppelganger.
Airspeed 12,500.
Roger, Doppelganger.
Countdown for second stage... ten seconds.
Five seconds.
Four, three, two, one.
Control, this is Doppelganger.
Now leaving Earth's atmosphere.
Roger, Doppelganger.

Launch Control, this is Doppelganger. In orbit.
Roger, Doppelganger. Stand by for computer report on Phoenix position.
Doppelganger, this is EUROSEC Launch Control.
Computer reports
Phoenix 20 miles ahead.
Your orbit is correct for automatic approach to EUROSEC should there be an emergency condition.
Thank you, Control.
I see it now. See it now, Control.
Beginning docking manoeuvres.
From now on, it'll be just as easy as parking a car.
For a man with reversed vision?
Launch Control, is Jason Webb there?
- Jason Webb here.
- About to dock. Any additional orders?
- Proceed with docking.
- Roger.
Launch Control from Doppelganger.
Jason, we were ri...
There are two planets.
There are definitely two identi...
Doppelganger, say again.
We lost your last trans...
- Jason, I'm not reading...
- Repeat, we lost your last transmission.
I'm not reading you.
Maybe you're reading me.
The retros on the Phoenix have fired.
I don't know why.
I'm pulling out.
Again, there are definitely two planets.
Identical, but reversed in some way.
Launch Control, if you're reading me, come in, please.
Give him the automatic-approach system.
- Dove now on automatic control.
- Roger.
Yellow condition.
All stations stand by.
Doppelganger to Launch Control.
If you're reading me, come in.
I've pulled out of the Phoenix.
Extensive damage all systems.
The one thing that's not reversed is the polarity of electricity.
Negative still negative, positive still positive.
- Phoenix re-entering.
- Is there a separate reading for the Dove?
- No, sir.
- Re-entry speed?
Speed 19,000 reducing.
Second blip on screen.
Could be the Dove.
- Speed?
- Stand by.
- Speed 12,000 reducing.
- Controlled re-entry?
As far as I can see, sir.
Angle of entry - fair.
Launch Control, cut automatic-approach system.
I say again, cut automatic-approach system.
Unable to affect landing at EUROSEC.
All vertical thrusters have...
Maintain automatic-approach system.
We'll bring him right down the beam.
If you read me, cut automatic-approach system. Unable to get off beam.
Angle of approach 30 degrees.
Red alert.
Repeat, red alert.
All stations, red alert.
- All stations, red alert.

Launch Control, cut automatic-approach system.
Unable to affect a landing at EUROSEC.
All vertical thrusters failed.

That's right.

TOKYO EIGA COPRODUCTION
Recognize these?
You know what they are?
You don't, do you?
You have no idea.
They're replicas of body parts.
You see?
Sadly, this is not only a finger.
It's an inferiority complex in the shape of a finger.
It's not that I specialize in treating fingers.
I'm a psychiatrist, in fact.
Inferiority complexes dig holes in the psyche, and I fill them in.

I was inspecting our new factory.
You don't mind my talking like this?
No, please continue.
Perhaps my technical background made me overconfident.
We were to use liquid air with extra nitrogen.
But they were short on time and gave me liquid oxygen.
They led me to believe it was liquid air.
You were terribly unlucky.
Yes... but I was to blame as well.
If I could have called it destiny, or even a war wound, it wouldn't be so bad.
But this is like being in exile.
Nobody remembers me... - not even as a cautionary example.
You mind stopping that?
I've become very sensitive to noise.
I'm sorry.
I was almost finished.
I wonder if losing one's face deranges one's senses.
You're tired.
Everyone says that.
What if we took off the bandages?
Out of the question.
- Some tea?
- No.
Come and sit down.
You can't sit still for a second when you're not polishing your gems.
Come on, sit down.
You sat over there so we wouldn't have to look each other in the face.
You're imagining things.
No matter.
I'm planning a little experiment.
Care to help?
- Aren't you cold?
- Are you?
No, not very.
I'm hot.
It's probably the bandages.
Why not take them off?
They'll ruin your skin.
You can't kill something that's already dead.
- Your face... -
- What?
You're old enough not to be so touchy about it.
I'll make some tea.
- Don't run away.
Why would I run away?
Why are people so biased about skin color and cheekbones and such?
Or repelled by hives, for example?
Exactly.
What I do know for certain is that you, for one, needn't cover your face with bandages.
Why are you so sure you do?
Perhaps I wouldn't if I were corresponding by letter, or on the phone.
What was your experiment?
I'll help you.
All right.
First turn off the light.
Turn it off?
Civilization demands light, even at night.
That may be.
But a man without a face is free only when darkness rules the world.
Isn't that why deep-sea fish are so grotesque?
How can you compare yourself to... -
Compare myself?
I live locked in a darkness ten times deeper.
What's that noise?
What noise?
I want to extinguish every last light in the world, or gouge out all of humanity's eyes.
If only somebody gave me that right.
Eyes aren't only for looking at faces.
The face is just a few dozen square inches above the neck, covered with a layer of dough.
Isn't that right?
I wanted to think so.
I told myself a million times it was only a layer of skin, a surface.
But now I'm not so sure.
The face is the door to the soul.
When the face is closed off, so too is the soul.
Nobody is allowed inside.
The soul is left to rot, reduced to ruins.
It becomes the soul of a monster, rotten to the core.
I feel as if I've been buried alive.
You closed the door yourself.
No one's stopping you from getting out.
You're right.
I and others are on equal terms... as long as we're all in darkness.
You see?
There's no hope.
It was just too sudden.
No, you'll never accept me.
Why aren't you stopping me?
But you work here.
How do you know?
How do you know
I'm not an extortionist in disguise?
Tell me.
- Your voice... -
- My voice?
Nonsense.
Everyone would sound the same in bandages like these.
I'm sorry, sir.
What for?
Don't worry about it.
Hey there.
Mind if I smoke?
Of course not. Why?
A cigarette dangling from a crack in the bandages... it looks freakish.
Don't talk like that.
Your secretary let me in without confirming my identity.
What?
I'd like to take some time off.
Of course. That's what
I've been suggesting.
I want time to figure out for myself whether I'm really qualified to stay on here.
You're the same person.
What's there to figure out?
I don't want to take advantage of your kindness.
Don't say that!
It happened in the line of duty.
That's not the problem.
I have no face, and yet... -
- You're tired.
If only it were that.
Sometimes I seem like a monster even to myself.
Stop tormenting yourself.
You think too much.
That's just wrong.
You're prodding me to cut off your hand instead of replacing your finger.
Saving patients is your duty.
But carrying out mercy killings is not.
Mercy killings?
Don't exaggerate.
I'm prepared to replace any body part at any time.
That's worse than bandages.
The obvious deception makes it even more hideous.
Would you prefer rotting teeth to false ones?
- That's different.
- How?
Tell me, how is it different?
- Go ahead then, if you insist.
- May I call the nurse?
But remember:
You'll be the one responsible.
I'll burn my wife's face so it looks like mine.
No objections to that, right?
Then you can give her your "false teeth" and all will be well.
You're talking like a child.
A man of your standing!
My wife refused me.
What good will revenge do?
Revenge?
Not at all.
I'd simply be acting upon your theories and freeing her from her prejudices about faces.
That would be therapeutic for me as well.
Nothing encourages a patient like being able to trust his doctor.
- Are you serious?
- Very much so.
Serious or no, it makes a good pretext.
I'm such a coward,
I can't resist such clever excuses.
Still, I'd rather not get involved in anything criminal.
I don't follow you.
I doubt it would succeed, but it would make an interesting experiment.
It's against medical ethics, but you've twisted my arm.
However, there's one condition.
You must tell me everything you do from now on.
I'm lending you the mask as a therapeutic tool.
It's not yours to keep.
Thank you.
It came out very well.
- Plaster of Paris?
- No, sodium alginate.
Next we'll use a paraffin mold.
- Can you come tomorrow?
- Yes, anytime.
This is my only work now.
SUPERINTENDENT
Do you live here?
I'm the super.
I saw the ad in the paper.
I'd like an apartment.
You can't.
He has a lady visitor.
- But I've come for an apartment.
- Please don't tell him.
I'll give it back right away.
Yes? Who is it?
I saw your ad in the paper.
Any vacancies?
I'll be right with you.
Sorry to keep you... -
Yoko!
Did you steal it again?
Your daughter?
Well, yes.
Excuse my appearance.
I was taking a bath.
About the apartment... -
Just a moment.
I'll bring you a brochure.
The doors lock by themselves.
It's a rough neighborhood, hence the chains. Come on in.
Here we have the bath.
This also locks automatically.
This is the toilet.
This is the bedroom.
Nice view.
There's a closet here.
I'm as determined as ever.
I found a hideout for the mask right after I left yesterday.
That's not what I was asking.
You mean my plans?
What's the purpose of your double life with the mask?
Ideally we'll compensate for one another.
You think it'll really work that way?
You know what I was thinking in that apartment?
Let me guess.
What to do with all your freedom?
No.
I was thinking about jealousy.
- Jealousy?
- Yes.
But that's only natural.
It's impossible for me to make my wife jealous.
You want the mask to make your wife jealous?
I want it for all my dealings with people, including that.
I'll ask you again:
Are you more interested in rejoining society than escaping it?
Anything wrong with that?
No. Psychologically, it's the healthier inclination.
I was afraid... you would use it to escape from yourself.
That's all a matter of perspective.
This plastic is fascinating.
Now it's like clay.
But the second you stretch it, it becomes elastic like rubber.
The modulus of elasticity is close to that of the skin's cellular tissue.
Applied along Langer's lines, it takes on the structure of real skin.
Langer's lines?
The axes along which collagen fibers are oriented.
I see.
I wonder how my face will look.
That's not to say
I don't trust you.
Yes, please leave it to me.
We can't do much without changing your bone structure and skin's thickness.
At most your face will make a slightly different impression than before.
How does the mask join the skin?
That's the difficult part.
It'll be most obvious around the eyelids.
You'll need sunglasses.
I'm in your hands.
I won't complain.
It's chilly out.
What are you doing?
I thought I'd make some tea.
We just had some.
Stop fussing about, looking for things to do.
It makes me feel you're hiding something.
Shall I turn off the lights?
No. As you see,
I'm quite comfortable.
I've grown used to the light, or maybe I've given up fighting.
- Where'd you go today?
- Nowhere in particular.
Are you concerned?
There's no reason to be.
There's not much a man with a bandaged face can do.
Still angry at me, aren't you?
Come now, don't say it as if you were the victim.
I didn't mean it that way.
You may be a victim too, after all.
Until a few days ago,
I half-seriously intended to carve up your face until it looked as bad as mine.
It would serve you right: spouting lies about how a disfigured face is no big deal.
I understand why you feel you had to say it.
The monster is always to blame... - what a convenient stereotype.
Everything's the monster's fault.
You harp on it so much,
I'm beginning to believe it.
I think that way because you do.
Your attitude makes things so awkward.
Why? What makes you imagine that?
How am I supposed to... -
Never mind.
I've outgrown that attitude.
Actually, I saw a movie today.
I hadn't in a long time.
It was cold.
Theaters do their business in the dark.
You needn't care how you look.
- What were they showing?
- As I was saying... there was a young girl sitting in front of me.
She was alone, but soon a young man sat beside her.
There were other seats, but he made a point of sitting right next to her.
I'll leave the rest to your imagination.
A very bold fellow.
Didn't care what anyone thought.
- And she let him have his way?
- I think so.
I mean, I don't know what really went on between them.
There were signs something happened, and signs nothing happened.
I was startled to realize he had the mindset of a man in a mask.
Executioners wore masks long ago.
I wonder if they shared the same mentality.
I'm watching you closely.
You feel you're talking to a hole in the wall, don't you?
- What does that mean?
- Nothing in particular.
There are monsters who act like people, and people who act like monsters.
Even monsters have their pleasures.
Anyway, stop acting like a victim, and spare me the phony sympathy.
Man, what a knockout!
Hey, don't be so stuck up.
Come on, say something!
Open up, please.
PSYCHIATRIC WARD NO. 2
Attention!
Air raid!
Let's play baseball!
The air raid's over.
A nice breeze.
It's a foul wind.
I'd like to see the sea.
Stupid girl.
I meant to tell her something nice.
Fine! Have it your way!
Hey, lady, get the ball!
- Oh, gross!
- She's scary!
I'm surprised. You're enjoying it even more than he is.
Yes, I am.
You can't perform such a visionary experiment on just anyone.
Wouldn't you like to make a mask for yourself?
Never. Simply watching such a perilous stunt is more than enough.
Is it that perilous?
It's like a drug that makes you invisible.
I can't say I understand where you see this leading.
What would my wife do if I made a mask for her?
Don't do that.
I'd like some coffee if it's ready.
- Sugar?
- Lots.
I've been smoking too much.
My tongue feels raw.
Your wife's listening again.
We may be doing a terrible thing.
It's frightening.
We're violating a cardinal rule of humanity.
Perhaps he'II... become someone else and seduce his own wife.
You think so?
You don't?
There are limits in life.
Men don't have wings.
No matter how high they rise, they always fall back to earth.
I've turned into a monster.
Brother... there won't be another war soon, will there?
Probably not.
But who knows?
We can't even be sure about tomorrow's weather.
That's true.
With war, as with everything else, you don't even realize until it's already started.
That's really true.
Good morning.
Don't worry.
I'm in a good mood today.
Say, will you have lunch with me?
Just kidding.
A mask makes a man bold.
Think nothing of it.
Just pretend I'm drunk.
I've thought a lot since our last meeting.
I've managed to calm down a bit.
I'd like to talk rationally about my future.
What's there to talk about?
Keep working here as before.
There's nothing more to it.
No, I can't deal with people anymore.
Let's not pretend otherwise.
I can still handle technical matters, though.
I'll have to wear the bandages for life.
If possible, I'd like to return to the factory at my present pay.
I don't see what's wrong with the current arrangement.
But if you insist... -
That's a load off my shoulders.
I'll arrange it before your leave's up.
Is your wife well?
Why?
"Why?"
Don't clobber me for asking.
From now on, I'll exist via telephone calls, documents, letters.
No offense, but all you'll see of me is my signature.
I want to be as inconspicuous as possible.
Well, I suppose we'll both get used to it.
Your face has lost its usual cheerfulness.
A few minutes looking at me leaves you exhausted.
No wonder my wife's not looking too well.
Well, I'll be leaving now.
How would he be?
That face?
Not the features... but the dimensions and skin texture.
Isn't he a bit young?
He looks easy to persuade.
Shall we go in?
What'll you have?
- It's kind of early for lunch.
- A cola, then?
Pardon us.
Two colas.
One for me too.
We'd like to ask you a big favor.
What?
What the hell's that?
The favor is worth 10,000 yen.
What do you say?
You haven't told me yet what it is.
We'd like you to sell us your face.
My face?
A mold of your face, that is.
We wouldn't skin you for a measly 10,000 yen.
Just a mold?
We won't use it for anything illicit.
But isn't that like taking my fingerprints?
The shape of a glove changes with the wearer.
We only wish to reproduce your pores and sweat glands.
Just the surface details.
This one's a waste of time.
There's nothing to lose, yet he refuses. Let's go.
I still don't get it.
What are you buying it for?
Please take it.
I'm going to Kansai tomorrow for a week.
- Business?
- I assume you don't object.
Of course not.
I'll have to pack your things.
When do you leave?
This is a surprise.
I thought you'd be impressed:
I've pulled myself together enough for a business trip.
Of course I'm impressed.
I'm sorry.
Don't be offended.
I didn't mean to pick a fight.
Let's talk about something else.
Your gem-polishing class is on Fridays, right?
Did you finish that stone you were working on?
Not yet. Almost.
I wonder if we see the true face of a gem when it's polished, or in the rough.
- I don't want to talk about that.
- Why not?
I think it's a trick question.
I see.
Changing the subject's your prerogative.
What would you like to talk about?
Have you ever wondered why women wear makeup?
Let's see...
Isn't it to deceive men?
You're way off.
During the era of the Tale of Genji, women believed it was a virtue to conceal their faces.
That's why poems of the time only mention their black hair.
Even now in Arab countries, a woman's face still remains hidden.
Makeup is also a sort of mask.
It's a sign of humility.
Humility?
As long as a woman is a woman, her face isn't worth showing without makeup.
Sounds like very roundabout sarcasm.
- Sarcasm?
- Isn't it?
Isn't humility better than vanity?
Sensible, practical, adventurous, pleasant, idealistic... - it was surprisingly hard choosing from so many facial types.
I asked the nurse's opinion.
Maybe I should've asked your wife too, eh?
No, the honor is all yours.
Bring the eyes.
Well?
You left the mole too?
Yes, it's more lifelike with a few blemishes.
Shall we try it on?
You can't really get a sense of it until it's in place.
Let me take off your bandages.
Don't move.
It fits nicely.
Beautifully done.
It's wonderful.
It'll be hot, but please bear with it.
The chemicals will gradually set.
Slowly move your lips sideways.
Now back.
Moving your facial muscles under this heat will create the appropriate wrinkles.
It's unnaturally smooth as it is.
Move your mouth once more.
That's fine.
You're free to talk or do anything you want.
Won't perspiration loosen the seal?
An astringent in the adhesive contracts the sweat glands.
You may feel short of breath at first, because your skin won't be able to breathe.
It's hard to make a "B" sound.
A slight change in your voice might be a good thing.
There's one hard-and-fast rule:
Never wear the mask for more than 12 hours.
Any longer and your skin will suffocate.
This exceeds... my wildest expectations.
It's an amazing change.
The face of a politician.
As I thought, it looks unnatural without facial hair.
What look shall we go with?
- Too big.
- Wasn't that one all right?
Not that one.
The other one.
This one?
Yes, that's good.
It's a rather odd feeling.
As if someone else has taken over.
It has character, doesn't it, Doctor?
The skin is only about four millimeters, even at the thickest point.
Just four millimeters?
Yes. It was a very delicate and precise operation.
I'm still not quite used to it.
It's a pleasant face, though it has a few quirks.
Even changing clothes can affect a person.
But I am who I am.
That can't change.
- Let's hope so.
- What's that supposed to mean?
Some juice, please.
As I said at the beginning,
I was reluctant to do this procedure.
I was certainly curious to see the results, but I also felt it was dangerous.
But you pressured me, and I had to give in.
Please drink this.
Practice using your lips.
Take this medicine as well.
- What is it?
Can you drink easily?
It was difficult to get down.
Fine, as long as you don't spill it.
Can I drink hot things?
Of course.
Shall I give him the injection?
Yes, that's probably best.
I'm feeling dizzy.
Another five minutes and you'll be fine.
Now, what was I saying?
- What was that shot?
Ah, yes, my apprehensions about the effects the mask might have on you internally.
Please don't exaggerate.
Does it feel like a thin pane of glass is shattering inside?
I don't feel the mask is really a part of me yet.
No feeling as of fresh air rushing in though an open window?
I feel trapped in a hothouse.
You'll feel better soon.
Once you're used to the mask, you'll be a new man... - one with no records, no past.
A mind invisible to the world.
- I'm me!
That pill... that shot... what were they?
- Are they taking effect?
- I feel numb.
One was a narcotic, the other a sedative.
I was afraid your resistance to the mask would wrinkle it unevenly.
Relax. Laugh. Whistle.
Yield to the mask.
Accept it.
- I understand.
- Three minutes more.
Smile for me, please.
No face can go over thirty years without smiling once.
You look as if you have a stomach disorder.
Come on now, smile. Try!
No, no, a real smile.
I can't feel the wind on my face.
Is that so?
They say a blind man can sense obstacles from the air pressure against his face.
It's as if there's something between me and the world outside.
I have to be careful not to lose my footing.
Give it a while.
You were born less than an hour ago.
You're like an infant.
To your maiden voyage.
Wouldn't it be more fitting to toast your remarkable creation?
No need for that!
Wait a minute.
I see now.
You're trying to evade the issue.
- Evade the issue?
- That's right.
You're trying to ignore how the mask is agitating you.
Nonsense.
You're the one who's agitating me.
Your manner shows you're no longer afraid of the light.
You're no longer the man you were when your face was covered.
- It's the drugs.
- No.
When the waitress brought the beer, you stared at her legs.
That's a sign the mask has started asserting itself.
I'm just dizzy, that's all.
Everything around me seems fragmented.
- Isn't that the essence of the mask?
- Can't you be quiet?
You feel guilty, don't you?
What on earth do you want from me?
For you to observe yourself honestly.
That was your promise from the start: to tell me everything.
I'm not hiding anything.
I just wish you'd stop asking leading questions.
Very well.
Perhaps I was too insistent.
Just don't push yourself too hard.
Push myself?
How?
- If it becomes unbearable.
- That again?

"Mothra" (Mosura)
Typhoon number eight...
Just passing the Caroline Islands
...has developed into a more powerful storm.
Its center winds are calculated at 60 meters per second with gusts of 80 meters per second!
It's traveling at 50 km per hour on a northerly course towards the Japanese mainland!
Attention all stations! Attention all stations!
The 5400 ton vessel, Genyo-maru...
...is caught near the center of Typhoon number eight!
Please standby for distress signals!
Navigator, what is our present position?!
We are about four miles east of Infant Island!
What? Infant Island?!
- Are you sure?.
- Yes Sir.We're drifting hat way quickly.
Damn...
The typhoon will push us into the radiation!
Captain! Hold on!
We've hit a reef!
We're taking water!
Are you alright?
Abandon ship!
Right! Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
They went down around this radioactive area.
Hey, our fuel is getting low.
This is helicopter JH-20 calling.
We've just made our first pass, over.
There doesn't seem to be any survivors. We are returning to base.
Look?
They're humans!
Helicopter JH-20 calling from sector K in the test area, over.
We are flying over Infant Island and have discovered four survivors.
Hey! We're here! Hey!
Just a moment please!
Just a moment please!
You will be given a chance for an interview soon enough!
Will we get a chance for an interview?
Let us take some pictures! That isn't asking too much!
Wait!
Let us in!
Dr. Harada...
...we've just completed the tests.
We didn't find radiation on any of them.
According to my calculations, this is scientifically impossible.
None of you have had any physical problems recently?
Do you know what I'm saying? None of you have any pain or inflammation of the joints?
Yes, we're all fine.
Excuse me...
What is it?
The truth is...
...I am a little hungry. That's because they let us eat a lot on the ship.
Hey, hey!
I'm with the Nitto Newspaper.
Nitto Newspaper?
Photographers are not allowed in here.
I'll have to ask for your camera.
Ten-chan!
I'm Fukuda from the Nitto Newspaper.
Who are you? Don't you know the radiation...
But there's no emergency, that's what you said.
I'm right, aren't I?
I'm Fukuda, pleased to meet you.
Since he's here, we may as well let them stay.
He's our''snapping turtle''.
Snapping turtle?
Oh, sorry...
What she means is when I get a hold of a story for the newspaper, I never let go.
About these guys...
Well, it's big news when they manage to survive radioactive counts of three million.
You'd think they'd be dead, huh?
So, the first thing you want to know is how they survived a radioactive count of three million?
Yes. This time I would like to ask them myself...
...how they managed to stay healthy in that radioactive area.
I want to be sure I fully understand what happened.
How could all these men survive in an area so polluted by radiation?
That's it. It was the red juice they gave us.
Red juice?
What is that?
It's what the natives there gave us.
The natives...
Did you say natives?! On Infant Island?!
This will put us on top!
The headline will read, ''The Mysterious Natives of Infant Island''.
What? That seems a bit overdramatic.
Be quiet. Put in what the Rolisikan ambassador said.
The Rolisikan government assures you...
...that we've thoroughly investigated Infant Island for natives.
We're not sure where they were...
...at the exact time of the atomic blast.
Ambassador, are you going to send an expedition?
The Rolisikan government has no plans at this time.
I wonder if anyone is an authority on those islands?
Dr. Chuzo should be able to assist us.
Chuzo?
He's an anthropologist.
He led the Polynesian expedition several years ago.
Good. Let's set up an interview right away.
I've already contacted him and sent Misgi to get a photo of him.
That was stupid!
What does it look like?
It's terrible! -How is it?
What the heck is this?
That's a great shot!
He doesn't like being photographed.
What a problem...
I have a feeling this is really big!
Hey, Chuzo...
Why won't you tell us all about the expedition?
You are the leader of the group, right?
You can hear all about it from the Rolisikan government.
Take his photo when he looks up.
I understand, I understand...
We won't try to take your photo.
At least let us see your face.
I don't have to show you my face.
What is it?
What's going on?
Sorry about that.
Hey, Shinji! Shinji!
Yes!
I told you to keep your pets in your room!
I was looking all over for it!
Chiro! Come here, Chiro!
Chiro! Chiro!
Just a moment...
I'll go and get it, alright?
Don't hurt yourself!
I'm fine...
Did you find it?
What's the matter?
What is it?!
Here.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Let's discuss the island. You are going on the expedition?
I haven't heard of one yet.
I'm sure you'll hear from them.
Isn't it amusing?
This has got to be an incredible discovery for someone like you.
It should open a new field of study for you.
Well, it should be interesting.
All of the Polynesian islanders share...
...a basic language structure and culture.
Does that mean that they are similar to the people of Hawaii or Tahiti?
Legends say...
...that the Polynesian people were the descendants of the ancient continent of Atlantis.
Do you believe what I'm saying?
I only believe what I see through the camera.
Then believe only in what you see.
The sound of a shutter reminds me of the sound of a guillotine.
A guillotine? That's a good one!
Please be careful...
Just like a guillotine, you'll never know when you're hit with a photo.
Wasn't that Dr. Harada? He's the leader of the Japanese expedition.
Hey, Michi!
Out of the way please. Out of the way.
What? The reporters have been shut out from the expedition?
Who was it that made such a demand?!
I'm sure you're all curious as to why reporters won't be allowed on this expedition.
There's no particular reason why.
We just want the mission to be successful.
Then you're saying that the press would just get in the way?
No, no, no... You and I see things differently.
This mission is my responsibility.
I won't need the services of the press.
It's a good thing you're out here.
I don't think reporters were allowed in there!
Hey, who is this Nelson guy?
Oh, he's the leader of the expedition.
I know that, but who is he really?
I don't think he's a scientist.
Why doesn't he want reporters?
Does he have something to hide?
Don't you think so?
I do.
Then he is suspicious.
He's suspicious.
Hey, is that what you think?
Then what do we do about it?
You must be joking!
Good luck!
Good luck!
Ten-chan!
Ten-chan!
Oh, Dr. Harada...
Is your meeting over already?
It's a good thing that you're taking it easy.
What was the meeting about?
Nelson is not a friendly man.
Nelson told me that he wants to see the expedition's data before it's released.
That's crazy!
He doesn't have any scientific background and he wants to have the reports?
I wonder what kind of business he's in?
Come out!
What are you doing here?
I'm just cleaning.
You were using that to clean?
I found it.
What is it anyway?
A Nitto Newspaper reporter doesn't make a good cabin boy.
I thought I was good.
Oh, well...
Just a moment.
You don't think I'm just going to let you walk out of here?
What are you doing here?
What is the meaning of this?
I just wanted to ask...
...if my research has to be passed on to you as well?
Of course.
Then, it's an order from the Rolisikan government?
It's my requirement for this expedition.
Then I'm ignoring it!
Let's go.
We will be approaching the site of the expedition in a short while.
You should you now put on your safety gear to shield you from the radiation.
Dr. Harada, how was it? Did you talk to Nelson?
I convinced Nelson to let him come with us...
...as long as he agreed not to do any reporting.
You could say I'm your cabin boy. Excuse me.
I'm Fukuda, with Nitto. Here...
Thanks.
Here...
Dr. Harada...
Why hasn't anyone decided to stand up against Nelson's control?
Even Dr. Roth reports to him, huh?
Is that what you say? Then, if Dr. Roth...
I'm a cabin boy. Sorry...
It is now time for us to go ashore.
I hope each and every one of you does your best...
...to make this expedition a great success.
Now, if any of you encounter any problems...
...the button on your right shoulder is a silent alarm transmitter.
Do not use it unless you are in urgent need of assistance, and we'll go to your location.
Please be patient in your research. Dismissed.
Chuzo!
What do you think you're doing?!
I'm lost.
What?
I am lost!
I have been looking for Chuzo.
What in the world did I step into?
This isn't normal growth.
They all look like fungus.
That's it, they're all giant fungus.
The survivors must have drank their juice...
...in order to stay alive.
I'm not sure which direction we should go from here.
It's amazing...
Doctor! I can't seem to find Chuzo.
That way!
Chuzo! What's wrong?
Chuzo! Chuzo!
Chuzo!
Hang in there!
Chuzo!
Chuzo!
Chuzo... Chuzo...
Hello.
Don't say that! What happened?
A blood-sucking plant attacked me.
That's it...
And then I was saved by two small women.
Small people? You're sure you didn't see children?
No.
I thought they were about 30 centimeters tall.
I could swear they were girls no larger than dolls!
What? Doll women?
You sure that you didn't imagine this?
No! They were real!
Well, we can't go back tonight.
We'll have to go back first thing in the morning.
Hey, how did these beauties come by to help you?
Beauties?
Oh, it's a journalist term.
You had a vision of two young ladies.
We like to call them beauties.
I got it!
Huh? What is it?
That's it!
Well, good night.
How's that for gratitude?
How can I interview you this way?
Jeez, I must be slipping.
What's the matter?
Chuzo!
-What's happening?
I think this has gone too far.
I'm not playing games.
I was wondering how they found me last night...
...when I figured that they were attracted to the sound of my alarm.
A song! They're communicating by song!
No, that's not a song.
It's their way of speech.
I'm not sure how they're doing it...
...but it's an unusual form of language.
Can you understand what they're saying right now?
It sounds like they want us to leave their island alone.
Oh, of course!
They want us to take our atomic tests somewhere else!
There will definitely not be any more nuclear tests.
You're very rude!
What do you think you're doing?!
I know movie producers who would want these girls.
Release those two girls this instant!
Doctor!
Nelson...
Natives!
They're coming!
They're over here too! Retreat! Retreat!
Release them now.
I have what we came here for!
Well, don't expect us to fight for you. Sentries put down your weapons.
Put down your weapons!
Boss, what do we do?
Are you sure?
Give them to me.
Let's get back to the ship!
Return to the ship! -Fall in!
Hey, doctor...
I wasn't sure what to think at first...
...but I think we're lucky to come to this island.
The ship has finally docked.
The investigative team...
...led by Nelson, the meteorologist, traveled to study the mysteries of life.
What amazing stories will they have to report?
A special event? It wasn't just a special event.
They went to an island hit with three million counts of radiation!
What happened to Fukuda? I want you to find him!
Ten-chan!
Welcome back!
Welcome back. Thank you for going there.
Is this what happened to you all this time?
I was very worried about you! The desk editor is furious!
Come on.
Was this your only trip to the island?
Why didn't we receive more reports?
Hey, wait a minute!
You can't leave without telling us anything!
Clark Nelson.
Date of birth and birthplace, unknown. Pre-war history is unknown.
In 1954, he traveled to the Amazon in search of a native tribe there.
Although the mission was a failure, he was praised for a job well done.
I'm thinking...
...doesn't he seem like an international art broker to you?
An art broker?
Sure... The type who seeks out ancient art and steals it to sell.
It's a profitable business!
Doesn't that seem like a far-fetched idea?
Right. But this guy...
Guess what map I found when I was caught in his room?
Infant Island.
Fukuda, I found something strange on the island.
Fukuda, here it is.
What is it?
What is this?
I found this on a rock beyond a cave I discovered on Infant Island.
A cave? Did you say you found a cave?
It was an unusual cave.
I would have told Dr. Harada about it...
...but Nelson was always around.
The same symbol is all over this thing.
I think the message is a reference to it.
Through the use of my manuals on all of the Polynesian dialects...
...I think I know what it is.
Then what does the symbol mean?
Mothra.
Huh? Mothra?
What could that mean?
I don't know.
You're both very cute girls. I'm glad that I could see you again.
Boss! The natives!
Fire! Fire and then retreat!
Mothra...
Mothra...
Mothra...
How long have you been our''snapping turtle''?
Five years, three months.
What?!
And you saw these girls on Infant Island?
Don't say that! Why didn't you file the story?!
Well?
Well, we didn't want them to get hurt.
Damn! That's your problem to deal with!
The scientists are human.
What?
The entire expedition group agreed to it...
...but we didn't expect this guy to put them into showbiz!
These girls are human!
We didn't want them to get hurt!
I'm a human, too!
Welcome, everyone.
We are living in the atomic age.
But people, does that mean there are no mysteries of life?
Have all of its wonders become obsolete?
No! Life is not without its mysteries! -Let's go up front.
This mystery is not a dream.
Tonight you will see the original life, the original mystery...
It is what I've discovered in my journey to the South Pacific.
I hope you enjoy the two lovely fairies.
Did you come alone?
No, my father is somewhere in the back.
I spoke with Dr. Roth earlier today.
It seems the Rolisikan government wasn't too enthusiastic about our expedition.
Oh, they were having financial difficulties, huh?
All of the financing was provided by Nelson.
So, he was your sponsor?
No wonder why he wanted to come along.
That melody...
Well, stop your meddling. Please go home.
I'm not meddling. I want an interview!
Well, that's enough for me.
I don't want you to know anything more about my mysterious ladies.
Hey!
What are you doing? No! No!
I'm not leaving! -You're going now!
What's going on?
Ten-chan!
Nelson!
It's been a while, huh?
I need to talk to you.
Talk?
Stop this inhumane show.
Return the girls to their island.
Inhumane...? You're crazy!
We make sure they get the best of everything!
These two mysterious girls aren’t just human beings, they're genuine treasures.
What are you saying?
My paper will tell all about what you're doing here!
You do and we'll sue you for slander!
Then why don't you tell me how much this fiend...
...profits from using these girls like slaves!
Slaves...? Don't be ridiculous! Do you think we use them like that?
My mysterious girls wouldn't sing if they weren't happy.
Then where are the girls?
Well, I don't know if this is right, but I'll let you see them for just 3 minutes!
If you're wondering if the girls are happy, you can see for yourself.
Miss, the camera, please.
I have all the advertising I need.
You're so rude! You can have it!
Please don't be worried.
Oh, they're pretty!
Do you understand me?
I'm the one you saved from the blood-sucking plant.
Hey, they look so frightened and scared.
Why don't we try to free them?
No.
We don't want Nelson to realize what we plan to do just yet.
But I don't like that guy.
We all feel the same way about that!
Hey, I hope you're doing well.
We don't think anyone in the world has the right to hold you like this.
Thank you.
The two of us do not wish to be here.
You finally understand what we're saying?
We do not have a use for words.
We understand through feelings and ideas.
Telepathy, huh?
Telepathy, right!
We truly want to return home as soon as possible...
But...
But, what?
She will come to rescue us...
...regardless of what happens to your country...
...and that fills us with great sadness.
Great sadness?
What's happening?
Mothra is coming.
Mothra?
Mothra is coming here...
...to rescue us.
Mothra...
...open your eyes. Mothra...
...your people are in need of you.
We need you to awaken for us now.
Look at this story! I want a retraction!
Anyway, you're paper had no right printing this story.
It is my newspaper's responsibility to report the truth.
Alright, you won't retract it for me, huh?
I'm going to the Rolisikan ambassador.
Your company will have big problems then.
Editor, this just came over the ticker-tape machine.
A large object...
...unidentified, floating in the South Pacific.
What does it mean?
Mothra is coming.
Mothra.
What the hell is a Mothra?
Infant Island has a legend, about a huge protector!
It's coming to rescue the girls!
That's just a load of garbage to sell newspapers.
I heard it directly from the girls!
What?
He's not lying.
Mothra is coming to rescue the two girls.
Everyone, what you are hearing, is one of the great wonders of life.
The only way to enjoy this spectacle is to hear it for yourself.
Hard to port! -Hard to port!
Shut up! All of you just shut up!
You want us to shut up?!
I'm not the one responsible for destroying the Orion!
This has no relation to me.
That's how it is.
We have nothing to do with an attack that was caused by a monster.
Is that so?
If you weren't holding onto the girls, Mothra wouldn't be coming here!
Coming to Japan! To Tokyo!
Think of the destruction!
Stop spreading lies! Your opinion is wrong.
Nelson!
Be quiet!
Regardless of what you say, it's pointless.
If you push this any further, we'll report you to the Rolisikan embassy.
You don't want to be indicted by them, do you?
Indicted?
Fine by me! Arrest us if you can!
Chuzo, it seems hopeless.
I hate to say it, but it looks bad for those two.
But, if we saw them once more...
Once more?
Let's go talk to the girls.
What is it?
We want to talk to the girls.
You can't!
No one goes in without the boss' approval!
I understand.
You think I'm joking?! You...!
Stop it.
Stop it!
I wish you would just cooperate!
What's going on here?! Damn you!
This can't be helped. I'll take care of these guys.
Hurry... Go talk to the girls.
Thank you.
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go, I said!
You're dealing with the Snapping Turtle! I'm not just a simple fast-talker!
Is there no way that you two can prevent this from happening?
Don't you have a way that you can control Mothra's strength?
Mothra has no way to understand.
Mothra is coming to us through her own instincts.
Really?
There's really no way you can control her?
We're very sorry...
...but there's nothing we can do.
That's it! Once more!
It's telepathy!
Can telepathy be stopped?
Can you do it?
We're testing something now that might be able to help us.
This material was designed with the hope...
...that it could prevent radio waves from affecting the oscilloscope.
I see...
If we could put them in a box made of this, Mothra may not know where to find them.
I've found it! It's about a hundred meters long!
Position? Okay, 137 degrees, 2 minutes north. 23 degrees, 10 minutes east.
Its current speed is 11 knots, heading for Tokyo!
Scramble our first air squadron.
We're right on top!
What? The lawsuit against us?
Oh, that's just a distraction.
Well, we'll be there to cover the Mothra battle.
Alright.
Well, I feel sorry for Mothra.
What?
It's all Nelsom's fault! If he would just release...
Damn!
What's the matter?
The Rolisikan government is supporting Nelson!
What?
The Rolisikan government states that it is obliged...
...to protect the rights of its citizens abroad.
Head to the defense office. Find out their plans!
Target sighted. Open bomb bays!
Bombs away!
Bombs away!
Everything you've tried was useless.
Are you certain that Mothra is really dead?
Of course, but I'm not worried about that.
I'm not so sure that she is gone...
...so take the box with you as a simple precaution.
Yes, yes... In case I'm wrong.
It's certainly not for your sake!
Hey!
Excuse me. We're only interested...
...in protecting others from your selfishness.
That's why we're giving you this box to stop them using their telepathy.
It's to prevent any misunderstanding.
I'm here!
Thanks for coming.
I am very lucky!
You're kidding.
What? Between god, prayers and my friends...
...I'm not chivalrous enough to go against Mothra for this pay!
Well, you're not alone there.
Is that an earthquake?
It doesn't feel like one.
Thank you, thank you.
Well, I don't think that I'll need it, but I'll use the box as you suggest.
How about it? The show is about to start.
No.
Oh, you won't need any money.
You can all be guests on my behalf.
Mr. Nelson, it's the phone for you.
Just a moment, please.
Hello? This is Nelson.
Huh? What? Cancel it?!
The Japanese Police are cruel!
Why should I cancel it?
Then go ahead and get it!
How rude!
Ten-chan!
You don't know what happened!
I know, I know... Nelson was called to cancel the show.
You're wrong! Something happened at Dam number three!
The dam?
Incredible...
Mothra!
It may destroy it! Let's hurry!
Let's go!
What's that?!
It's breaking! Run! Run away!
Stop it!
Alright!
I don't know how, but your pet is not taking you back to your island!
Be quiet!
I won't tell you any more!
In the case.
Get away!
Halt! Halt! Halt! Halt!
Halt! Halt! Halt!
Stop! Stop!
Doctor, it has to be Mothra! -Here, hold this for me.
How did she get here?
You can't do this! You must leave the bridge!
It's no good! Leave! Leave!
Hurry! Hurry!
Look out! Hurry! Hurry!
Ten-chan!
Mothra is angry because...
...Nelson is holding the two small girls against their will.
For their sake, I am taking them from him.
I hate Nelson.
Where could he have gone?
What's the matter?
A kid managed to get in the building.
He was wearing a red cap.
That kid could be a problem.
Damn that Mothra!
Anyway, we have to get rid of that kid for our own sake. Hurry!
I'm going to let you go.
Thank you...
...but Mothra is coming for us.
You should hurry and get away!
I'll be alright! When I get you home...
...my brother will return you to your island.
You bastard! How could you let him get away?!
Idiots! What's going on here?!
Well, a kid broke into the building and...
Go find that kid! Find him now!
There he is!
Hey! -Wait!
Hey, you! Wait! -Get back here!
Did you find him?
We can't find him anywhere!
Damn! Where did he go?!
Boss! Here he is!
Idiot!
Editor! The Rolisikan government is backing down!
The Rolisikan government is afraid of losing its ties to Japan...
...and is ordering Nelson to release the girls!
Alright! You're the top!
I'm going over to the theater! I want to see the look on Nelson's face!
It's terrible!
I know, I know! Wait for me here!
Hey!
Chuzo! What brings you here?
What's going on?
Nelson's about to be spooked!
My little brother said he was coming here to free the two girls.
Huh...? Hold this!
Fukuda! This is Shinji's!
You don't suppose...
Shinji!
Shinji! Shinji!
Hey! -Shinji!
Shinji!
Shinji! Shinji!
Brother!
You're safe now.
Are you okay?
Brother, I let you down!
It's alright!
Don't worry, Nelson will get what's coming to him.
Hey, it's terrible!
I know. Nelson, right?
What are you saying?! Mothra's on her way here!
What did you say?
Mothra? Where?!
She's making her way toward Tokyo!
Mothra's passed Mount Fuji and is heading for the city where Unit 2 is waiting. Roger.
Yes, Unit 2 is ready. Waiting for orders.
Unit 3 is moving into position within the city.
With Mothra approaching...
...residents of the Shibuya ward are asked to evacuate to the emergency shelters.
All residents of Shibuya...
...please evacuate your homes and make your way to the emergency shelters.
Fall back! Fall back!
Boss, this way is no good!
Perhaps it would be better if we went toward the sea?
Turn around. I have an idea.
...Ameike, Akasaikami. Those areas have just been evacuated. Let's try to stop it there.
It's currently at Goma 2-1. Mothra is making its way toward Tokyo Tower.
All of the local population there has been evacuated.
Ready to fire!
Ready to fire!
Wait for the commander's orders!
Yes, sir. Our unit is ready to attack. Roger.
Stand by!
What's that?
Base, base! Mothra is building a cocoon!
Mothra will grow in the cocoon until it's ready to leave.
That's probably how they'll return to Infant Island.
General, has Nelson been found?
He was last seen at the theater, but no one has seen him since then.
Boss...
You're George Walker, with the Rolisikan ambassador.
Alright?
Excuse me.
Editor!
I'm not paying you to sightsee!
How about Mothra making a cocoon?
What about Nelson?
I haven't found where he is.
Do I have to play ''G-Man'' for you, too?
This Mothra in front of us isn't a story!
Your behavior is disgraceful!
There hasn't been any sighting of Nelson up to now!
The first thing Nelson would do...
...is to get on jet bound for Rolisika either tonight or tomorrow.
How would that be possible?
I'm sure he could pull a few strings.
He'll do anything to keep the girls away from Mothra.
Let's go to Hanada Airport!
Excuse me.
The military command of the Rolisikan government...
...is willing to loan you its best offensive weapon.
These atomic heat cannons...
...will they be here in time to assist us?
Please relax. They will be here within ten hours.
With Mothra cocooned on Tokyo Tower...
...the army intends to surround the creature while it's dormant.
They hope to launch an attack while it is asleep...
...to end this confrontation without a large assault.
The Japanese and Rolisikan governments hope the atomic heat cannons will do the job.
In front of us, Mothra is not moving. The attack will begin shortly.
Hey!
Incredible...
We will begin our attack at 10:00.
Your attention please! Your attention please!
The military will begin its attack at 10:00!
When the atomic cannons begin firing...
...it is recommended that you wear your protective glasses!
Attacking in sixty seconds!
Ten-chan, your glasses.
Thirty seconds!
Twenty seconds!
Ten seconds... 9... 8... 7...
There is no doubt everyone, that the cocoon was...
Boss, with no one to follow us, we should be alright.
You're right. We're not in Japan anymore.
This is my home in Rolisika.
Mothra would never figure out that we would hide on a farm.
It appears that the monster...
...known as Mothra has been defeated.
A military commander is heading towards a microphone.
Everyone... everyone in the entire world, please wait.
Mothra has been confirmed dead!
Boss, boss! We're safe now, huh?
Well, sing! Keep singing!
You'll sing a long time before Mothra shows up!
Chuzo!
Look! Mothra seems to be heading for Rolisika.
Right, doctor?
Well, Nelson won't be safe in Rolisika.
Rolisikan patrol jets are in the sky searching for Mothra.
On that matter, public opinion of the Rolisikan people...
...have turned against Nelson as this continues.
The Rolisikan police have been instructed to arrest Nelson on sight, and they are actively...
Boss, this won't work!
If we go out there, we'll be picked up for sure!
Hey, I have something important to tell you.
What are you doing here?
I've been asked to help the Rolisikan government.
Don't tell me...
...that they want our help in trying to speak to Mothra?
You're right.
I'm right?!
Sure... What could we possibly say to it?
No, our problem is the girls.
We're the only ones that they've spoken to that they seem to trust.
I see...
But where do we find the girls?
First of all, we find Nelson...
...and they'll be happy to return to Infant Island.
Your attention please.
We've just learned...
...that Mothra has been sighted in the Newkirk City area.
Boss, I don't like this plan.
Chuzo, what do we do now?
Should we open it here?
No!
How would Mothra react if she knew they were here?
We shouldn't put these people through that!
Newkirk City is in bad shape.
Chuzo...
Do you remember this?
Oh, the symbol on Infant Island?
That's right. Look up there!
I get it!
That symbol must have some special significance with Mothra.
Right.
Hey, those bells... They remind me of the girls songs.
Chuzo, is there any way...
...that we can use this mark and the sound of the bells?
Mothra and the sound of prayers...
And songs...
Alright, let's do it.
We need you to have this symbol drawn as large as possible on the airport runway.
This?
Yes. We need it as soon as possible.
We'll do it.
And then, can you get the church bells of every town to ring at 3:00?
You want them to ring at 3:00?
Yes.
Okay, I'll see what I can do.
Do you think it will work?
Well, I don't doubt the power of prayer.
It's not so mysterious, but it's all up to god, now.
Well, we better get going.
It's 3:00.
I'm not sure... But it seems to be quiet.
It's coming this way!
Is it okay?
Alright. It's landing.
Thank you, everyone.
We pray that our land and yours will live in peace and harmony.
Thank you.
We promise not to disturb the peace of Infant Island.
Thank you.
Mothra is waiting for us. Goodbye!
Take care.
I'm not sure if we'll have peace and harmony, but we'll do fine.
Goodbye.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
That's it!
I've got to call the editor! It's a top story!
Oh, no! -Huh?
I didn't get a picture!
It's alright!
The path of peace...
...is yours to discover for eternity.

Dr. Grant, Dr. Pierce...
- ... can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.
Paul. Greg. Brad.
Now this is a tough assignment.
But if this mission is successful, you will be the first men to land on Mars.
This project has been the most costly yet devised by man.
However, the safety of the crew and passengers still takes top priority.
Now is that clearly understood?
Captain Paul Travers?
Yes, sir.
- Space Captain Greg Martin?
- Yes, sir.
- Space Navigator Brad Newman?
- Yes, sir.
- Dr. Grant?
- Yes, sir.
- Dr. Pierce?
- Yes, sir.
OK. Away you go, and good luck.
Thank you, sir.
All right, this is it.

- OK, Greg. 
Coming back now.
Stand by.
Here we go!
(chatter)
- Gentlemen.
- (men fall silent)
You've now had time to study the fine report...
...that has been produced by our aviation investigators.
We at the Martian Exploration Center thank those concerned...
...for their untiring efforts in this direction.
Although the report runs to 862 pages and meticulously describes...
...every happening that led up to the crash 24 months ago...
...the conclusion is all too simple: Sabotage.
Now, before we progress, I would ask you for a vote of confidence...
...in the findings of this very fine report.
Thank you, gentlemen, for your unanimous support.
24 months have now elapsed since the tragic crash of the Zero X.
In eight weeks, Earth will again be in a suitable position in relation to Mars...
...to make the second attempt.
Can I take it that I have your approval for this, too?
I think our security arrangements are inadequate...
...and suggest we ask International Rescue to be present at the next launching.
Are you suggesting we are incapable of handling our own security arrangements?
I have 862 pages here, sir, which say just that.
(uproar)
Well, Father?
Takeoff is scheduled for tomorrow.
- You'll have to make a decision soon.
- Even if it's no!
This is a tough one. I know how you boys feel. I guess you're rarin' to go.
But as you know, we have a strict rule here:
...no International Rescue craft is launched unless someone is in grave danger.
- Right?
- Right.
- Guess so, Dad.
- That's the way it's always been.
- Guess you're right, Dad.
- Yeah.
However... rules were made to be broken.
Now, this is what we do.
- Scott.
- Yes, sir?
Launch Thunderbird 1, go to Glenn Field and stand by...
...for the takeoff of Zero X.
- Yes, sir!
Virgil, launch Thunderbird 2 and follow Scott to Glenn Field.
When Zero X takes off, escort it on the first part of its journey.
- Yes, sir.
- Father, can I...?
Yes. Launch Thunderbird 3 and orbit the Earth...
...until Zero X has established its course to Mars.
- Gee! Thanks, Dad.
- What about me, Father?
It's unlikely that you'll be needed, but be ready, in case.
- Yes, sir.
- OK, boys.
Thunderbirds are go!
Thunderbird 1... ready to go.
OK, Scott, clear to go. Good luck.
Thanks, Father.
Well, you made your decision, Mr. Tracy.
Yes. I only hope it was the right one.
Now that the boys are going to be at the launching of Zero X...
...the safety of the crew is assured, but...
But what about the saboteurs?
Do you think they will strike again?
Say... what's the time, Tin Tin?
The time? Uh... just about eleven o'clock, Mr. Tracy.
That makes it about 4pm in England - tea time.
I don't understand, Mr. Tracy.
Well, those saboteurs you were talking about. If they do strike again...
...I know just the person to take care of them.
Will that be all, m'lady?
Thank you, Parker. That will be all.
Very good, m'lady.
(bleeping)
International Rescue, England.
Lady Penelope speaking.
(Mr. Tracy) Hi, Penny. 
Well, I've made my decision. 
We're gonna oversee the Zero X launch. 
Thunderbirds 1, 2 and 3 are on their way.
Go to the States immediately and ensure that there's no sabotage attempt this time.
FAB, Jeff. I'll fly over with FAB 1 right away.
Now, I'll need to move around there freely on this type of assignment.
Can you pull a few strings to see that I get the necessary passes?
Will do, Penny. There's a big press conference tomorrow evening.
- You'll represent a British magazine.
- FAB, Jeff. 
You rang, m'lady?
Yes, Parker. Get out the Rolls-Royce.
I'll call the airport - we're taking off for America with FAB 1 immediately.
Thunderbird 2 from Mobile Control.
You are clear to land.
Mobile Control from Thunderbird 2. FAB.
Well... I guess we're all set.
By morning, Thunderbird 3 will be in position to observe the launch path...
...and we've got all our gear here.
- Thanks.
I guess that's all we can do for the moment.
See you at the press conference tonight.
No, thanks. As far as we're concerned, the only good publicity is no publicity.
And in conclusion, as I always say, the only bad publicity is no publicity.
So have a good conference, but please be brief.
Our astronauts can only spare you half an hour...
...as they have a very busy schedule ahead of them tomorrow.
- Captain Travers?
- Yes, ma'am?
I'm Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, representing The Universal Mirror. 
First question: Tell me, what do you find most frightening?
The ordeal of this press conference or your flight tomorrow in Zero X?
(chuckles) Without question, this press conference, ma'am.
Thank you, Captain Travers.
Now, I'm sending a messenger over with a small St Christopher...
...specially struck for the occasion by The Universal Mirror. 
I would like to tell my readers that you'll be wearing it during the flight.
- It'll be a pleasure, Lady Penelope.
- That's very kind of you.
Well, it looks as if my time is up.
Best of luck for tomorrow.
- (line buzzes)
- Captain Paul Travers.
Package from Lady Penelope,
Universal Mirror, sir.
Right.
There'll be three crew and two scientists. Right...
Right again.
Yep, at 1400 hours tomorrow.
That's right. Six weeks and two days.
I'm afraid I can't answer that question.
I'm afraid you'll have to refer that question to the PRO.
Why, sure. We'll do anything to help the press.
I've got a feeling that the takeoff tomorrow is gonna be just fine.
60 minutes to liftoff.
Commence Zero X pre-flight assembly.
Thunderbird 2 from Mobile Control.
- Are you ready, Virgil?
- Standing by, Scott.
Mobile Control calling Thunderbird 3.
OK, Scott, in orbit.
I should see Zero X as it leaves the Earth's atmosphere.
- Unless liftoff time is altered. 
- FAB, Alan.
Now, m'lady?
Now, Parker.
(bleeping)
(long bleep)
Channel 1, m'lady.
(bleeping)
Good. That's all right.
(bleeping)
(long bleep)
Channel 2, m'lady.
Clear launch apron. 
Zero X moving into position. 
(bleeping)
Channel 5, m'lady.
Thank you, Parker.
- Trouble, Parker.
- I thought it was too good to be true.
Lady Penelope calling Scott at Mobile Control.
- What's the trouble, Lady Penelope?
- Number 5 negative.
OK. Penelope, here's what we do. 
The countdown must continue... 
... or we miss the rendezvous
with Thunderbird 3 in space. 
I'll attend to number 5.
Meanwhile, locate Dr. Grant. 
FAB.
This is Assembly Control. 
Radio-controlled lifting body 2
about to take up its position. 
Everybody OK?
Yeah. Yeah... fine.
Everything's just fine.
And how about you, Dr. Grant?
Are you OK?
Keep quite still, Doctor.
There's something wrong with your...
...face!
- (Dr. Pierce) He's got a gun!
Allow yourself ten seconds before coming through this door after me.
Otherwise, you might get your head blown off.
I think I've located number 5, m'lady.
That's him, Parker.
Well done. Number 5 was a phony,
but he's got away. Take care of him. 
Right, Scott. Leave it to me.
But before I go, you'll find the real Dr. Grant on a bearing of 1 7 4...
...and a range of 1,204 yards from my present position.
FAB.
I can see the gentleman in question ahead, m'lady.
He's just leaving the control tower in a motor car.
Right, Parker... away we go.
(car horn)
(horn blares)
Now, you'll find the real Dr. Grant somewhere in this building here.
Right.
Airport police. This is Assembly Control.
Search the missile store, block F, immediately...
...and locate Dr. Grant's whereabouts.
Providing he's OK, bring him over to Central Control immediately.
Roger, Control. 
- Say, how do you know all this?
- A pretty little bird told me.
- He's got a good start on us, m'lady.
- Yes, I can see him down below.
My guess is he's making for that motorboat by the jetty.
- How're you feeling, Dr. Grant?
- Just fine.
He just held me at gunpoint, tied me up, and locked me in the missile store.
Guess it's another sabotage attempt.
What beats me is how you knew where I was.
All you need to know is that the launch is taking place as per schedule.
OK, sir.
So much for the good-luck charm given to me by Lady Penelope.
- Safety belts on, m'lady?
- Safety belts on, Parker.
Lowering hydrofoils now, m'lady.
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it!
Takeoff lighting.
It looks as if an accomplice is waiting to pick him up in that helicopter, m'lady.
It's an army 'elicopter, m'lady, and no doubt it's 'eavily armed.
Well, let's hope they attack, Parker.
Then we may have an opportunity to shoot it down.
Mobile Control to Thunderbird 2.
Launching underway.
- You'd better lift off yourself.
- Thunderbird 2. FAB.
- Stand by to take evasive action, Parker.
- Yes, m'lady.
Now, m'lady?
Now, Parker.
Just a little bit over to the right, old son.
Thank you very much.
I don't think there's much point in looking for survivors, Parker.
No, m'lady.
(planes approaching)
Look, m'lady!
- Look!
- What a magnificent sight!

She's on course and accelerating to 100,000 miles per hour.
- OK. Thanks, Alan. Return to base.
- FAB.
International Rescue calling Zero X.
Congratulations on a superb liftoff.
Our services were not required... 
... although a sabotage attempt
was made just before liftoff. 
But we took care of it.
The rest is up to you.
International Rescue from Zero X.
Dr. Grant has just told us about it.
The only thing we really want to say is thanks.
And may I add my thanks and congratulations, too.
You did pretty well yourself.
Mobile Control from FAB 1. Are we clear?
Hi, there, Penelope. All clear. 
I'm on my own. Well, how'd it go?
- FAB.
- Well done, Penelope. 
Well, it's been a hectic time for all of us.
How about us all getting together tonight over a drink?
I hear there's a fab nightclub called the Swinging Star near my hotel.
FAB.
Hi there, Penelope. I just happened to be
monitoring your frequency and I, uh... 
Well? What do you say, Virgil?
Are you game?
I sure am!
You're going where?
Ah, the, uh... to the Swinging Star, Father.
It's some kind of nightclub.
That means you won't be back till morning.
(humming)
Sure, I understand - you need a break.
But this is a tough job we're doing here.
Mr. Tracy, all work and no play makes Scott a dull boy.
Hm... OK then, Scott. Have a good time.
Gee thanks, Dad. Glenn Field will be able to reach us by radio at any time.
Don't forget, Dad, we'll be at the Swinging Star.
Right, Scott.
- The Swinging Star?
- Yeah, it's some sort of a nightclub.
- They're all going out to celebrate.
- A nightclub?
And I'm stuck back here at base. Just my luck!
Say, Tin Tin... why don't we go off to the mainland tonight - just the two of us?
That would be lovely, Alan.
I'll wear my new dress.
What goes on around here?
Have you all gone crazy?
This is International Rescue, remember?
We can't leave the base unmanned.
- Sorry, Tin Tin.
- That's all right, Mr. Tracy. I understand.
Well, I don't!
- I'm going to bed.
- But won't you have some coffee?
No, thanks. It keeps me awake.
(moaning)
(Scott) We're all going
to the Swinging Star. 
(Mr. Tracy) No, Alan. 
Have you gone crazy?
We can't leave the base half-manned. 
Penelope, you're 30 seconds late.
The Swinging Star... Sounds great!
- (car horn peeps)
- Why, here she is!
Why, hello there, Penny.
- Have I kept you waiting?
- Of course not. You're dead on time.
Where to, m'lady?
Why... the Swinging Star, of course.
- Now, m'lady?
- Now, Parker.
Why, we're flying!
That's right.
Turn right just past planet Mars...
...and you should see the Swinging Star straight ahead of you, Parker.
Right, m'lady.
There it is, m'lady. Straight ahead.
- Gee! It's fabulous!
- I thought you'd like it.
No parking problem here, m'lady.
(# electric guitar instrumental)
Wow! What a terrific group.
Yes. They always play at the Swinging Star.
You see, they're way-out. 
Say, Penelope... how... how did you enjoy your night here with Scott and Virgil?
Oh, we didn't come to this Swinging Star.
- Oh, really?
- No. This is reserved especially for you.
Oh... uh...
Gee! Have some more champagne.
(snoring)
(compere) Now, ladies and gentlemen, we present the biggest star in the universe:
...none other than Cliff Richard Junior!
# Sometimes I feel you are cheating me
# Then you kiss me and my mind is free
# But then I think I should let you know
# That I got friends
# So, baby, listen to me
# A shooting star will shoot you
# And Mars will go to war
# The man in the moon will jump on you
# If you don't love me no more
# I saw you in someone else's car
# You told me that he won't go too far
# That may be so
# But you let him know
# That I got friends
# So, baby, listen to me
# A shooting star will shoot you
# And Mars will go to war
# The man in the moon will jump on you
# If you don't love me no more
# You tell me that I'm the man for you
# But you do things you should never do
# So now, hear this warning once again
# Yes, I got friends
# So, baby, listen to me
# A shooting star will shoot you
# And Mars will go to war
# The man in the moon will jump on you
# If you don't love me no more
# If you don't stop making me lose face
# I will have you put up there in space
# So just do what I'm a-telling you
# Cos I got friends
# Baby, listen to me
# A shooting star will shoot you
# And Mars will go to war
# The man in the moon will jump on you
# If you don't love me no more
- What an evening!
- It isn't over yet, Alan. The night is young.
- Come on, let's dance.
- Yeah, let's dance.
(bleeping)
Alan Tracy, International Rescue.
Oh, Alan, sorry to disturb you,
but this is an emergency. 
Look, Father, can't Scott and Virgil handle this? I'm kind of tied up right now.
I'm afraid Scott and Virgil are away
enjoying themselves, as usual. 
You are the only one I can rely on, Alan. 
I quite understand, Dad.
I'll be down right away.
FAB.
- Penelope, we've got to go.
- Oh, Alan! Must we?
Penelope, I'm afraid we must. Duty calls.
But is there no way you can get out of this?
Look, Penelope, Dad needs me.
He's depending on me.
I've just got to go.
Mind the gap, m'lady, when you step into the car.
Thank you, Parker. We don't want to fall back to Earth, do we?
Mind the gap, Alan.
Mind the gap, Alan.
Mind the gap, Alan.
I can't possibly make it!
What's the matter, Alan?
What's the matter, Alan?
Don't tell me - you're afraid.
- I'm not afraid.
- A brave astronaut like you, afraid?
I am not afraid!
(Penelope's laughter echoes)
(thud)
Alan?
Alan, are you OK?
Alan! Alan, where are you?
Gee!
Sorry, Dad.
I... I guess I fell out of bed.
I've had a word with Brains. He says this modification is possible. Right, Brains?
- Check.
- What the heck are you talking about?
Oh, come on, you two!
The water's lovely and warm.
Thunderbird 4 at your service.
Catch!
Can't a guy get any peace around here?
Wish John was here to enjoy the fun.
But someone's got to man the space satellite.
(Paul) Zero X to Earth. We have just
touched down successfully on Mars. 
All systems are go. Will radio a full report
to you in 30 minutes' ground elapse time. 
(bleeping)
Go ahead, John.
Father, I was just listening to
the Zero X transmission to Earth. 
They've safely landed on Mars. Thought
you'd all be interested to hear the news. 
Thanks, John. Keep in touch.
FAB.
Listen, everyone! Just heard from John.
After six weeks in space,
Zero X has safely landed on Mars.
- Well, Dr. Grant? What do you think?
- We need to get as many samples...
...back to Earth as possible, so we can look into the possibility of life on Mars.
Sure, but what's your initial reaction?
The atmosphere would be breathable, but too thin to sustain life as we know it.
The early Martian photographs are going to prove right:
...there's no water up here.
- You can tell this from your instruments?
80 per cent instruments,
20 per cent intuition.
I agree with all Dr. Grant has just said.
But I've always been fascinated by that phrase "Life as we know it".
I have a feeling that we may encounter life as we don't know it.
These strange formations seem to be all over the planet's surface.
Don't ask me why... but they worry me.
Ray, don't let your imagination run riot.
Yeah, Tony, I know it would be all too easy to happen up here...
...but can you account for the strange rock formations?
A considerable study will have to be made before we know the answer.
But, um, my first impression is that...
...when the crust of the planet was very thin, it was struck by meteorites.
As they punctured the shell, so the hot rock exuded onto the planet's surface...
...like toothpaste out of a tube.
- A good theory, Tony.
Now explain to me how the exuding rock wrapped itself into a coil.
Ray, you've got a point.
This is one of the many things we have to investigate.
We're behind schedule. Can we move on?
Sure. Sorry.
Ray, I don't like the look of these peculiar formations either...
...though I'm sure they're just rock.
There's no sign of movement.
We'd better take a sample back to Earth.
I must say, I think that would be a wise precaution, Tony.
Can you break one up for us, Paul?
I'll go out and collect some pieces.
Sure.
OK, Paul, not too big a charge now -
I want to get a sizeable piece.
OK, Ray.
- And, Paul.
- Yeah?
As soon as you fire, I recommend you stand by at the ready.
Stand by at the ready? What for?
I don't really know.
I've just got a feeling, that's all.
Right... I'll go and get my gear.
- Greg, get the airlock ready.
- OK, sir.
Dr. Pierce! Come back in here, quickly!
Zero X from MEV. We're under attack from a form of life we do not understand.
Require immediate rendezvous with main body.
I'm just coming round on third orbit.
Will be in position in four minutes.
We'll take evasive action until you're in position.
- Give us liftoff clearance when it's OK.
- Will do. 
But we must lift off immediately. We don't know what damage they can do to us.
Doctor, we can't lift off until the main ship's in the correct rendezvous position.
Otherwise, we'll be stranded in space.
Greg, there's a whole line of them ahead.
We'd better return their fire. We can't take too much of this punishment.
OK, skipper. So far, all systems are go.
Zero X from MEV.
How are we doing, Brad?
Approaching orbital position.
Starting countdown.
Rendezvous liftoff: Minus 100...
- ... 34... 33... 32... 
- Skip the countdown. We're lifting off.
- Paul, you may not have enough fuel!
- We've no choice. We're coming up.
Greg, lift off.
- Leaving atmosphere.
- Right.
MEV from Zero X. I have you on screen.
You're approaching Zero X orbital path.
Five seconds to retro firing.
Four... three...
... two... one. Retros!
Thanks, Brad.
Guess we'll make it OK now.
All systems here appear to be at green.
OK, Paul, stay where you are - conserve your fuel. I'm coming up right behind you.
At least the Martian excursion vehicle has joined up with the main body of Zero X.
These, uh, so-called rock snakes,
Father - what do you make of them?
Well, clearly, there's life on Mars.
But I guess it's not life as we know it.
You, uh... you think they'll get back OK?
According to the reports John monitored in the space station...
...the damage to the MEV has not impaired their efficiency.
As a matter of fact, I, um...
...I had a word with the controller at Glenn Field this morning.
He said their re-entry into Earth's atmosphere will be straightforward.
They've done it a hundred times before on test flights.
What's the scheduled date for the re-entry, Dad?
Well, their flight takes them six weeks...
...so they should be arriving on the morning of September 2.
Dr. Grant, Dr. Pierce, are you ready for re-entry?
- OK, Greg, we're ready.
- Roger. 
OK, skipper, all set.
Central Control, this is Zero X.
Computer reports fire retros 30 seconds.
Ground stations, verify countdown.
You have our green light. Five seconds...
...four... three...
...two... one. Retros.
(female operator) Central Control
from Goldstone. Retro firing A-OK.
Zero X re-entry attitude correct. 
(male operator) Woomera to Central
Control. Verifying Goldstone's report. 
Zero X from Central Control.
You are in correct re-entry attitude and
are about to enter Earth's atmosphere. 
Roger, Central Control.
Retros.
Zero X from Central Control.
Lifting bodies now at 50,000 feet.
Radio control over to you in five seconds...
... four... three... 
... two... one. 
Over. 
OK, Paul, we've got the lifting bodies under our own radio control now.
Rendezvous with lifting bodies at 120,000 feet: 20 seconds.
Reduce speed to Mach 2.
Rendezvous about to take place.
Right, hold her steady, skipper.
I'm bringing in lift body 2.
Roger.
Keep her steady, skipper.
(flat beep)
Radio-control failure. I can't hold her!
What's happened?
Central Control, this is Zero X.
Emergency!
We have lost lift body 2 in a collision caused by a fault in our radio-control unit.
I'll send up another lift body immediately.
That won't help - the locking gear was damaged in the collision.
(Paul) Check on all systems shows
fuel systems go. All control systems go. 
Remote-control radio circuits
are dead. Escape unit is... 
Central Control from Zero X.
Escape-unit circuits are dead!
OK, John, I get the picture.
- Continue to monitor their frequency.
- FAB.
Right. Now, we've got to move fast.
Zero X is coming in on one wing.
It's impossible to get another wing attached.
She's unable to maintain height and will crash in about 30 minutes.
The most recent check shows that they have an escape-unit failure.
Unless we get the crew out before they hit the ground, they are all doomed men.
Scott, you know what to do. Take Brains with you for technical advice.
Yes, sir.
Virgil, take pod 4, with the air-to-air rescue equipment...
...and rendezvous with Zero X.
- Alan!
- Yes, sir.
I want you to board the Zero X and fix that hatch.
- Father?
- Yes, Gordon, you'll be needed too.
Yes, sir!
Tin Tin, I'll want your help.
Thunderbirds are go!
Maximum speed, Scott.
We're gonna need all the time we've got.
Mm-hm.
Zero X from Central Control. 
What is your rate of descent now,
and what is your air speed?
Rate of descent: Stabilized at 3,000 feet a minute. Air speed: Mach 1.2.
We can't slow the rate of descent -
the motors are flat out. Over. 
Zero X, roger. Stand by.
Emergency Control, this is Central Control.
Contact Washington immediately.
Zero X crash position established as Craigsville - population 4,800.
Impact time: 35 minutes.
So you'll need to move!
International Rescue, Zero X Central
Control here. This is an emergency!
This is International Rescue,
Thunderbird 1.
Anticipated your call. We're on our way.
ETA Glenn Field: Ten minutes.
Will you give Thunderbird 2 a course
to steer for a rendezvous with Zero X?
- They're on this frequency. 
- Roger.
Thunderbird 2 from Central Control.
I'm passing a steer to you.
Zero X's present position
is international fix system 2-4-0-4... 
- ... on a heading of 143 magnetic. 
- Roger, Central Control.
I've tried everything in the book, but the escape unit system is dead.
If only International Rescue had been with us this time.
Zero X, this is Central Control. 
Change to channel 4.
International Rescue are on their way. 
They require to make contact. 
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir. Changing to channel 4.
I'll be glad when Scott's got his Mobile Control operating.
We'll need his assistance in locating the Zero X.
We must be getting pretty close by now.
I'll get my rescue gear on.
- Gordon, get up to the astrodome.
- OK, Virgil.
Zero X, this is International Rescue
Mobile Control. Can you hear me? Over. 
International Rescue, this is Zero X.
We hear you, loud and clear.
Zero X and Thunderbird 2 from Mobile Control.
Transmit ten seconds of unmodulated carrier wave on this frequency.
One at a time, please.
- Zero X.
- Zero X. Roger. 
- Thunderbird 2.
- Roger, Thunderbird 2.
Thunderbird 2 from Mobile Control.
Steer 0-0-2. Fly at 45,000 feet.
With your present air speed, you should sight Zero X in about four minutes.
Roger. Will do.
- What do you intend to do?
- We hope to put a man aboard Zero X.
If we succeed, we may be able to fix the escape unit. Excuse me.
- Zero X, this is Mobile Control.
- Mobile Control, this is Zero X.
Here are your instructions. Follow them precisely if the rescue is to succeed.
Go ahead.
There are approximately 15 minutes left before your aircraft crashes.
For the next ten minutes, lose as little height as possible.
Keep your aircraft steady. 
Watch the trim. 
In ten minutes, switch to automatic pilot
and go into the escape unit. 
And then... pray.
Till then, take further instructions from Thunderbird 2.
Mobile Control, this is Zero X.
Your instructions will be complied with.
Thanks.
- What are they gonna do?
- We may learn more from Thunderbird 2.
Scott! I can see it.
Alan, Gordon, stand by.
Zero X dead ahead.
FAB, Virgil.
Zero X, this is Thunderbird 2.
We're coming in below you.
Reduce speed to low safe cruising and lower nose landing gear.
We're gonna put a man aboard
to fix the escape unit. 
- So that's what they're going to try to do.
- It's suicide!
- Release air brakes, Greg.
- Right.
Lower nose wheel, Greg.
Thunderbird 2, this is Zero X.
Lowering nose wheel.
Are you sure you want to try this?
It sounds mighty dangerous to me.
It is mighty dangerous, and we do
want to try it. Now hold her steady. 
- Gordon, flight control over to you.
- OK, Virgil.
Left, left. One degree.
Right, right. Two degrees.
Right, Virgil.
- Stand by to hold position.
- OK, Gordon. 
Now!
Good shooting, Gordon.
Zero X, this is Thunderbird 2, air-to-air rescue compartment.
Keep it dead steady. Man coming aboard.
- (Paul) Roger, Thunderbird 2.
- OK.
How are you doing, Thunderbird 2?
Fine. Just keep steady, that's all.
Slow right down... and... stop!
- Give me a time check, Gordon.
- You've got four and one half minutes. 
Mobile Control from Alan.
OK, Brains. 
On the right of the master cylinder...
...that supplies power to the hydraulic system of the nose wheel...
...you will find a yellow wiring harness.
Follow this through to a red junction box marked "EUC".
Got it.
Doctors Grant and Pierce, hold tight.
I'm removing you to escape unit.
OK, Paul.
OK, Paul.
OK... cover removed.
Place transistorized-radio-induction unit on the side of the junction box.
- OK, Brains.
- Right, Alan. 
Now, all you have to do... 
... is remove the screws that are
anchoring the yellow and green lines... 
... and reconnect them on one block... 
...so we get a direct link, green to yellow, all the way down the bank.
OK, Brains. Time check, please.
- Two and one quarter minutes. 
- Right.
Brad, Greg, I'm sending you both back to the escape unit.
Right, sir. Switching to automatic pilot.
No, don't switch to the automatic pilot.
I'm staying here.
I'll come back when we're at zero feet.
That guy's risking his life.
It's the least I can do.
- I'll stay with you.
- Me, too.
No! There won't be time for us all to get into the escape unit at the last moment.
I'm sending you two back now.
And that's an order!
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck, Paul.
Zero X from Thunderbird 2.
Are you all in escape unit?
Thunderbird 2 from Zero X.
All in escape unit except me.
I can do better than the automatic pilot in holding this craft steady.
I'll go back into the escape unit when it's fixed, or when we're at zero feet.
It'll help. Thanks.
He won't be able to make it in time, surely?
- They're all running out of time.
- How are you doing, Alan?
OK.
- How much time have I got?
- One minute. 
Gordon! Alan isn't through yet, and we're dangerously near the ground.
Play out more cable.
I'm coming alongside Zero X.
OK, Virgil. 
Glenn Field, this is Washington. 
Evacuation of Craigsville is complete. 
Thunderbird 2 from Zero X.
Is he through yet?
No, not yet. 
I'll overrun my engines to give us a few more seconds.
Zero X from Thunderbird 2.
Into escape hatch immediately!
Alan from Virgil. Jump at end of five-second countdown.
Five... 
... four... 
... three... two... 
... one. 
Now!
Now, Scott! Now!
Are you OK, Alan?
OK, Virg. Did they make it?
This is Thunderbird 2 calling
Zero X escape unit. Are you OK?
Thunderbird 2 from Zero X escape unit. 
Yes, we are OK. Paul only just made it. 
He's badly shaken up,
but he's gonna be all right. 
- Did you hear that, Alan?
- I heard.
- Did you hear that, Central Control?
- We heard. Well done!
Virgil from Gordon.
We can't retrieve Alan.
Due to his hurried departure, the cables are fouling the side of Thunderbird 2.
- We'd better drop him to the ground.
- FAB, Gordon. 
Say, Virgil, I think that's FAB 1 below!
Thunderbird 2 from FAB 1.
Virgil, we're down below.
Why not drop Alan down here?
Yeah, Penelope, I can see you!
Say, how did you get here?
As soon as we heard the forecast crash position, we made our way here.
OK, I'm down. Cable released.
Gee, it sure was swell of you to come here and pick me up, Penelope.
After that brilliant performance, I think that's the least you deserve. Now jump in.
I assume, madam, that the first call will be Glenn Field...
...and then on to your hotel.
Is that correct?
That, Parker, is quite correct.
Gee! You mean you're going to take me to the Swinging Star?
- Just the two of us?
- Just the two of us.
It's like a dream... come true.
Gee... this must be the most memorable day of my life.
You know, Penelope, I'm always treated like a kid back at the base.
You know, being the youngest and all.
But tonight, being alone with you,
I feel like a real grown man.
But you are, Alan. You are.
Particularly with that snazzy moustache you're wearing.
- It adds years to you, Alan.
- Well, uh...
We have to wear a disguise sometimes when we're out in public...
...in case we're recognized.
Do you really think it suits me?
Excuse me, Alan. I think the gentleman on the next table wants something.
Hm?
Would you mind passing that ashtray?
- Disguise. Pretty good, eh?
- Why, Dad! What are you doing here?
Just thought I'd come and congratulate you on your great performance today.
- Me too, Alan. A great job.
- Scott!
Thanks to you, Alan, another International Rescue success.
Virg! Who else is here?
And I think it was a splendid effort,
I really do. Even though I can't see you.
Thanks, Brains. And I guess the little lady with you must be Tin Tin.
Yes, Alan. Congratulations on your performance today -
...and tonight.
And there was I, thinking we were all alone!
Remember, Alan...
...one of the most comforting feelings a man can have in this world of ours...
...is never to be alone.
To Alan, the hero of the day!
To Alan!

Goethe saw that it was Faust's relentless search for objectives...
In the end, Faust was saved because he ceaselessly strove... for the goal he had never obtained.
That's very good, Mrs. Gardner.
"Go to night school." It's very good.
There's only one thing wrong.
It's the word "night."
I know it sounds like N-l-T-E.
But we spell it...
N-l-G-H-T.
Night. Okay?
I can never get that one word, that "school."
- That's wrong, isn't it?
- Yeah.
It's S-C-H-O-O-L, Charly, not S-K.
S-C-H-O-O-L.
Okay, everybody.
Next Wednesday, we study through Page 20.
Good night.
I should like you to work very hard.
Whenever you can...
You must come next Wednesday.
- Every week, okay?
- Thank you very much.
Good night, Miss Kinnian.
Charly, we missed you.
At the clinic.
The doctors wanted to do some tests.
Yeah. Well, I forgot.
I went to the library.
I've never seen so many books in my life.
Don't forget the clinic tomorrow night.
No. I'm gonna write it down on my blackboard twice, I promise.
- Good night.
- Good night, Miss Kinnian.
Hello, darling. Thanks for waiting for me.
Good night.
For instance, apples and pears.
They're both alike because they're both fruit.
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.
Okay, we'll begin. Shoes and gloves.
Charly, shoes and gloves.
- My rabbit's foot.
- That's good, Charly.
Shoes...
Shoes, gloves.
Shoes and gloves.
- You wear them.
- That's right.
Airplane, automobile.
Airplane...
Automobile.
You ride in them.
Morning, afternoon.
Charly, you don't have to worry about passing or failing. Not these tests.
That's a very funny face, Charly.
Charly, I'm going to show you some pictures.
Look at me.
What happened in this picture?
What do you see?
- Is there something missing?
- No.
I want you to make up a story about these people.
I can't make up a story...
- About people I don't know, Miss Kinnian.
- Yes, you can.
You can make-believe.
Make up a story.
Is that a family?
That's a family.
Who is this?
- That's a father.
- Right.
If that is the father, then who is this?
That's a mother.
If that is the mother...
Do you remember your mother?
Yeah, sometimes I remember her.
I think I remember her.
Sitting on the edge of a bed... putting her hand on my head and saying,
"He's burning up."
But, then, maybe... that was a woman at the institute,
I don't know.
Probably a woman at the institute.
Charly!
It's 5:00, Charly.
Forgot what you have to do?
Finish the floor.
Come on, Charly, think.
You were gonna take something home.
Yeah.
For a minute there, Charly, you had me worried.
You're always thinking such deep thoughts.
How you gonna remember a little thing like your landlady's birthday?
Yeah, Mrs. Apple is gonna be real happy.
And thanks for making me remember, Gimp.
What are pals for, Charly?
Give me the broom.
Me and the boys will help you clean up.
- Right, fellas?
- Right!
Come on, Charly.
Gimp, what gives?
We filled his pail with raw dough this morning, full of yeast.
It growed. It got big.
It growed. It got big.
Yeah, Charly again.
He has a marvelous opportunity.
Is that a him or a her?
- We call him Algernon.
- Algernon.
- Please, set up Number Four.
- All right. You can take it away now.
Now, you come, Charly, and I'll show you something.
Okay, dear. See you at 9:00. Bye.
Doctor, why are you using the mouse test?
We're simply using a laboratory animal,
Mrs. Kinnian... to spur the subject on to his best effort.
Now you and Algernon are going to run a race.
Well, I can beat him
'cause I'm bigger than he is.
It's not that kind of race.
- Charly, what does this look like?
- It's a puzzle.
Very good, that's right. Now watch.
We put Algernon in here to start.
Then we put some food in here, at the finish.
And Algernon knows he must find his way through the puzzle... if he wants to get the food.
- And if he don't?
- Then he doesn't get to eat it.
He don't?
Don't worry, Charly. He won't go hungry.
Now, Charly... this is a diagram.
Diagram? It's exactly the same as Algernon's puzzle.
You'll take this pencil and draw... from the start to the finish... without going through any of the lines.
You'll start at the same time
Algernon does... and we'll see who gets through first.
Do you understand, Charly?
Ready?
Start.
Very good.
He beat me.
He beat me. I didn't know mice are so smart.
Come on, Charly, cheer up.
How would you feel if you was dumber than a mouse?
Good night, Miss Kinnian.
Charly, aren't you gonna ask me up?
I've never once seen your apartment.
I'd like to see it.
- Well, it's just a room.
- It doesn't matter.
It's upstairs.
Can you imagine, Monty?
Charly Gordon with a girl.
He better have her out by 10:00.
There will be no hokey-pokey in my house.
- It's just a room, Miss Kinnian.
- It's very nice.
Who are they?
That's Gimpy and the guys at the bakery.
They are my best friends.
Charly, may I have a glass of water, please?
Yeah. Would you...
- Would you like a soda pop?
- Yeah. That will be fine.
- How about you?
- No, that's okay.
- Would you like to sit down?
- Yeah, I would.
Grab a chair.
Thank you.
I'll sit in this chair.
It's little, but it's good.
I had a radio but it got busted.
- Charly?
- Yeah?
Can you keep a secret?
Yeah. I'm a good secret keeper.
That mouse you raced today.
Yeah, that Algernon.
He was very special.
He had an operation.
When it was over, he was smarter.
The doctors are ready to try that operation on a man.
They're ready to choose someone now.
That's why you had all those tests.
Well, they should have told me.
I would have tried harder.
- Would you like an operation like that?
- Yeah.
Why?
I'd like to be smarter... so that I could understand Gimpy and the fellas at the bakery.
There's a lot of their words
I don't understand.
Just so I could get a little closer, you know.
I think we can get you to race Algernon again.
I don't know.
Algernon is a smart little mouse.
Ready now? Start.
Take it easy. You ready? Start.
Well, here are the results.
His Performance IQ is 59...
Verbal 69, Full Scale 70.
Too low, at least for our first subject.
We have other retardates... who might be more suitable.
I've never met one who has Charly's motivation.
He came all by himself for two years to night school... to try to improve his reading.
That's all very well, Mrs. Kinnian.
But I think...
Isn't it true that the average retardate is overly sensitive and sometimes hostile?
In Charly's working environment... he is the butt of all kinds of jokes, some of them cruel... yet he always remains cheerful and pleasant.
The fact remains he's a grown man.
Doctor, is the operation dangerous?
It need not involve any unusual surgical risk.
It's the postoperative period we're concerned about.
The younger our subject... the less complicated his emotional adjustment is apt to be.
There is one point in Charly's favor.
Mrs. Kinnian.
Whoever we decide on will have to be put in an accelerated learning program.
He'll need a full-time teacher.
Somebody with Mrs. Kinnian's background, even more important... someone he trusts.
Would you be available?
My fiance and I were planning to work... on a joint thesis for our doctorates.
Well, at the moment, it's all hypothetical anyway.
Of course.
- Thank you, Mrs. Kinnian.
- Thank you, Doctor.
Come on, Charly. Let's go.
Yeah, just one more, Miss Kinnian.
Not quite.
You sure are a smart mouse, Algernon.
Good night, Bert.
- Good night, Bert.
- Take it easy, Charly.
Good night, Algernon.
That Father Callahan now. Take him, Monty.
He's one of that new breed of liberal priests.
It's no wonder the younger generation are selling their souls to the devil.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the historical tour of Boston.
This is the Charles River Basin where amateur yachtsmen can sail 365 days a year.
In the late afternoon, you can see the sculling crews of Harvard...
MIT, and other universities, practicing for their annual races.
On the left is the Prudential Center.
The Prudential Tower, 52 stories high... is the tallest building in the continental United States... if you consider Manhattan Island outside the continental United States.
Here's Bunker Hill Monument.
Stands 220 feet tall,
30 square feet at the bottom...
15 at the top, 294 winding stairs.
It'll take you approximately 2o minutes to walk up, 15 minutes to come down... and 10 days to get over it.
The Boston-Cambridge area has a total of 189 universities and small colleges.
We are now going through
Boston University... which includes a School of Law, a School of Political Science... a School of Philosophy, a School of Accounting... a School of Nursing, a School of Business Administration... a School of Fine Arts, and many others.
As we make a right-hand turn, look to your left.
You'll see the Boston Public Library.
The third oldest library in America.
There's over 2 million volumes in its collection.
On your far left is the Old South Church.
As we make a right-hand turn on Boston Street, look to your right.
You will see Trinity Church, founded in 1877... designed by Henry Hobson Richardson.
Phillip Brooks was pastor of this church for 22 consecutive years.
While being pastor, he was made Bishop of Massachusetts.
Most of you people remember Phillip Brooks by his famous church hymns.
One of the most famous Christmas carols,
O Little Town of Bethlehem.
We'll make a brief stop in South Boston, to discharge a passenger.
- See you next Sunday, Charly.
- Okay.
- Come on, Charly, just one beer.
- No, I can't. Not tonight, Gimp.
- I bet you're gonna see that school teacher.
- Boy, could I give her a lesson.
- I didn't think you went for broads.
- Sure I do.
What do you do with her?
I promised her. I can't talk about it.
What do you mean you can't talk about it, Charly?
- Ain't I your best buddy?
- Sure you are.
- What's the big mystery?
- I promised her. I can't talk about it.
- Charly, I'm disappointed in you.
- Don't be mad at me, Gimp.
So come on over and have a beer.
Just a little beer.
Okay.
- Charly, how about playing a little music?
- Yeah, okay.
- I've got it here.
- Hold it, Hank.
- Charly's got lots of dough. Right, Charly?
- Yeah, I save my dough.
I bet you got a bundle tucked under the mattress.
What do you save it for, Charly?
- Well, I don't know. Something.
- What?
- So blow two bits, Charly?
- Yeah.
Watch this.
Charly, what did you do to it?
Drop a slug in?
No, I put a quarter in there, Gimp.
A real quarter.
Talk to the juke, Charly, like you always do.
Yeah, okay.
Juke, I put a quarter in there, and you better play. Do you hear?
Charly, Juke don't like to be scolded.
Juke likes a nice, sweet tone of voice.
Okay, Juke.
You're a nice juke and you got nice lights, and you're real nice.
- Come on back here, champ.
- We knew you could do it.
- Charly, you hear it's liable to snow tonight?
- I don't know. I didn't hear that, Gimp.
That's what they say. I'll tell you what.
How about stopping off at the corner of
Manning and Standish on your way home?
- Okay, what do I do there?
- I'll tell you, Charly.
A lot of people don't know this.
But I'm gonna let you in on it.
That's where the snow always starts. Yeah.
Right there on the corner where Manning runs into Standish.
Now you wait there for a while... and when that first flake comes down, you give us a call.
That way we get to get home in time before it really starts coming down.
- Okay, Charly?
- Yeah.
Who do I call?
Paddy, give Charles one of your cards.
- Better get started, Charly.
- Yeah.
None of that now.
I guess I can afford to buy a beer for good old Charly.
All right.
Go get them, tiger, go get them.
So long, pal. See you later.
Well, here's to a blizzard.
Buddy, what you doing?
What you doing?
Waiting for it to snow.
Let's go.
Stupid.
The operation.
- The operation?
- Yes.
- I made it?
- Yes.
I made it!
- Miss Kinnian?
- Yes.
I don't feel no smarter.
Ready? Start.
Again, Charly.
Again. Try.
Please.
How did the lessons go tonight?
- Just one more...
- I keep doing it again and...
But try it, Charly.
Post-surgical recovery is complete.
These five mice, look at their mental curve.
He's shown no comparable intellectual progress.
No.
Charly, I know that you can do it.
I know that I can't do it, Doctor.
Yesterday, and the day before, you keep saying I can do it... and Miss Kinnian says I can do it, everybody says I can do it... but I know I can't do it.
- But we know you can do it.
- I know I can't do it.
Charly, try. It makes a lovely, nice figure.
I can't do it, Dr. Straus, you know I can't do it.
I know I can't do it, and I don't want to do it.
- I can't learn nothing.
- Charly!
- Did that operation make me dumber?
- Nothing of the sort.
I can't do any of the puzzles, and I'll tell you something else.
I ain't racing that Algernon no more.
I'm sick of being beaten by a mouse...
- And people laughing at me.
- Nobody is laughing at you.
I don't care! I'm going out of here, now!
"My name is Dick. I live in a house.
"I have a sister named Jane and a dog named Spot."
My name is Charly Gordon, and I live in a room... and I got no sister, no dog, and I am stupid!
And what are you doing here?
I ain't gonna race you.
I know why they brought you over here, but I ain't gonna race you.
'Cause I don't like you. You're not my friend!
Charly Gordon.
Do you have a girl in your room?
No, it's a him!
Charly Gordon.
It's a mouse.
Young man, there are no mice in this house.
There's one in my room.
They brought him over in a cage.
But I ain't gonna race him.
Cage. Charly.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
Could you step in here, please?
Monty. That nice Charly Gordon is coming to visit.
You say, a cage. A pet mouse?
Yeah, but I ain't gonna race him.
Come in here for a minute.
Sit down, Charly.
Don't sit on Monty.
Sit down, Charly.
- Charly.
- Yeah.
Having a pet is a gift from God.
- Isn't that right, Monty?
- I don't know, Miss Apple.
Don't argue with me, young man.
I'm telling you.
This little mouse is a blessing in disguise.
First of all, a pet keeps you company.
They don't talk back.
They're loyal and loving.
They are truly man's best friend.
A little animal is one of God's creatures.
They live only to comfort you.
Now, Charly, you go right back up there, and you make up with him.
Tell him you'll feed him... clean his cage and give him water.
That's all he wants. That, and your love.
And in return, he'll give you many happy hours.
Monty, why don't we give Charly... one of your bones, to give to the little mouse?
Would you mind?
I don't know if mice are carnivorous or vegetarious.
Anyway, Charly, here you are.
- What are you going to call him?
- They call him Algernon.
You and Algernon are welcome down here at any time.
Thank you, Miss Apple.
Algernon.
What do you think of that, Montgomery?
Hi, Alg.
Wanna race?
You ready, pal?
Go.
I beat you.
I beat him!
I beat him!
Professor, Dr. Straus, Miss Kinnian!
I beat him!
Charly!
Miss Kinnian, I beat him.
I was in the room... They put...
Somebody... A mouse...
I got the wrapper, and I spelt "school."
I put him, and I beat him.
I creamed him!
Miss Kinnian, what happens now?
Punctuate it.
Go ahead, punctuate it.
Now, I got something all made up for you to punctuate.
Punctuate that.
That does not make sense.
"That, that is...
"is.
"That, that is not...
"is not."
"Is that it?"
"It is."
Student surpasses the teacher.
- Mrs. Kinnian.
- Yes.
Where's Mr. Kinnian?
He died.
Are you in love with Frank?
Tomorrow's studies.
Basic chemistry.
- Good night, Charly.
- Good night, Miss Kinnian.
This is the Capitol of the United States.
Our government is divided into three branches.
The Executive, the Legislative, and the Judicial.
What are the two legislative branches of Congress called?
Turn off the teaching machine to answer.
House of Representatives and Senate.
You are looking at a film of one of our country's most significant events.
Who are these men? Why are they here?
What did they do almost 2oo years ago, that affects your life today?
Those men are getting ready... to sign the Declaration of Independence, and declare our country... free from England.
And I'm getting ready for work.
- Hey, Charly.
- Yeah?
- You know what day it is?
- I don't know, Gimp.
We aren't keeping you awake, are we?
Is it that chick? Just won't let you alone?
- It's April Fools' Day. That's what day it is.
- His birthday.
The English Constitution.
- Hey, Gimp.
- Yeah?
- You know what a Magna Carta is?
- That's a cigar, isn't it?
Come on, Hank. I need that.
You really know all this stuff in here?
Or are you just looking at pictures?
I know some of it.
Hell, Charly, you're so smart that...
Yeah, why not. Here.
- See this machine?
- Yeah.
- You know what it is?
- It's a machine that you work.
How would you like to work it?
- Gimp, you kidding?
- What do you mean, kidding, Joey?
Man knows what the Magna Carta is.
He'd be able to operate a simple machine like a pastry mixer.
It took you two weeks learning how.
That's a very complicated machine.
Not for Charly. Come in here closer.
Look, this is all you got to do.
Step number one.
You turn on your water. See?
Make sure the temperature is 78 degrees, okay?
Then we come over here and set our water pressure at 1 40 pounds.
See that, right there.
Set it back and turn on the water switch.
You got this now, right?
Now we follow our fresh water along that line to that valve, see?
Excuse me, Joey. I wanna get up there.
We come up here... and we open up our flour hopper.
Lets our flour down here.
You mix it with the water, okay?
Come over here.
Open up our bowl.
I want you to get a look at this dough.
Then we start up our agitator.
This stirs up the dough inside.
Okay, see it? All right.
Then we close it up.
Now comes a very important thing.
These timing switches.
Set your timing switches.
They're very important. Don't forget these.
Now, Charly, you put all this together, and it comes out dough.
- What do you say?
- I don't know.
- Suppose he breaks it?
- Then we get the day off.
April Fools' Day.
Watch it!
Watch Charly.
- Charly, that was perfect.
- Great. I love that.
You couldn't have done better than that.
Mrs. Kinnian. Come here, quick.
There's a whole new world in it. Look at it.
- It's exciting?
- Yeah.
Let's see if you can identify... the activity in each of these slides.
Is he in love with you?
Frank.
I'd rather not discuss my personal life, if you don't mind.
Not that there is anything secret about it or even unusual.
It has nothing to do with your program of learning.
- First slide.
- I got a birthday present.
- It's not my birthday.
- It's not for you.
Algernon.
It's his birthday cheese.
What makes you think it's his birthday?
How do you know it's not?
That's true. Happy birthday, Algernon.
Happy birthday, Algernon.
It's very nice of you, Charly.
Well, he's very special.
Nice paintings. Now, Judy, what...
I painted a house.
Isn't that nice, dear?
And what is your... Mrs. Kinnian.
That's nice that you came.
Dean, would you be good enough and go over to Cathy?
Play with the pumpkins.
You can sit down, Mrs. Kinnian.
Would you do it, Dean, please?
Thank you so much. Thanks a lot.
That's nice what you've painted, Dean.
- Look what I made.
- It's so bright.
I got your letter, Mrs. Kinnian.
I'm afraid I can't accept your reasons.
I'm holding him back.
He knows the answers and questions before I even open the book.
- And?
- And what?
You seem tense. Is it that important for you to resign from this project?
I gave you my reasons.
Which I must reject. You are a psychologist.
You know that Charly has made a transference... and at this point, is completely dependant upon you.
He's involved with you emotionally.
That's normal, isn't it?
And you are involved with him emotionally?
Why do you ask that?
- I am engaged, you know.
- I met your fiance.
Very charming.
How long have you been engaged?
I'll stay until the convention, Doctor.
No longer.
I've got to go.
Bye-bye.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, Mrs. Kinnian.
Faneuil Hall. Built in the early 1 7 40s... and given to the city by the merchant
Peter Faneuil.
It burned in 1 761 but was rebuilt.
It's still in use as a market, a meeting place.
Why is it known as the Cradle of Liberty?
If we'd walked in there, say in 1 77 4... whom might we have met attending a meeting of protest?
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
The next stop along the Freedom Trail is the North Church.
Built 1 723.
Boston's oldest church.
For what historic incident is North Church known?
I'm sorry, I didn't...
What happened here that became part of our national heritage?
Two lanterns in the steeple signaled Paul Revere... that British were on their way to Concord.
Right. Any questions?
I was wondering why people... that would never dream of laughing at a blind or crippled man... would laugh at a moron.
What happened?
My friends at the bakery got up a petition, and I got fired.
Is that an automatic law, something like gravity?
Increased intelligence equals lost friends.
You needn't worry about losing your job.
The doctors want you to work full-time at the clinic... studying, learning, and getting paid, too.
Will you be there all the time?
Yes. I imagine so.
At least until the convention.
The doctors have been asked to head a symposium.
The annual meeting of the
Society for Cerebral Research.
I suspect you and Algernon are scheduled to be their prime exhibits.
What will we have to do?
Maybe speak a foreign language... do an exercise in neo-Boolean math.
Both of us?
George Bernard Shaw wrote something once...
Pass the ketchup, please.
- I didn't know he wrote that.
- What?
Pass The Ketchup, Please.
- Here's your chowder, sir.
- It's the lady's.
No, seriously.
Thank you.
He said, "Whenever you learn something, it seems at first...
"as if you've lost something."
A whole universe is opening up for you.
It's a world that's always been there... but not for you. Not till now.
Cream, please.
Now you're growing, and growth causes pain.
You do your job very well.
Bert, please.
Are you quite certain of your evaluation of Charly's Rorschach tests?
There's no question in my opinion.
Thank you.
Once the initial breakthrough occurred... subject completed all elementary school work in five weeks.
A capacity speed-up occurred during the high school phase.
And all this work was accomplished in three weeks.
Instructions were then accelerated.
You have been pushing him much too hard.
Subject made the leap from rote memorization to a grasp of abstract theory.
The next step was attaining insightful function and the ability to restructure.
- Subsequently...
- Richard.
May I please have your attention?
Emotionally, he's still a child.
Frightened. Insecure.
Look at these drawings...
I've had him do.
They are representative of the last... two months.
- Each one progressively more disturbed.
- Disturbed?
He likes to paint.
He still can't believe he's being paid to do nothing but learn, paint, and improve.
But can't you see?
I cautioned you about this before.
These aren't disturbed.
They are more sophisticated.
More abstract than the ones he did a couple of months ago.
You go right on ignoring even the evidence.
Come.
Anna, I don't think we should interrupt his studies.
Thymine, guanine and cytosine.
Structure of the insulin molecule.
Double-chain, 51 amino acids... employing 17 basic aminos cross-linked by sulfur atoms.
What metal and what gas would you combine...
- In order to convert heat into...
- Electricity? Tantalum and cesium vapor.
Yes.
What is the technique called the algebra of...
What are you trying to turn him into?
- Some kind of side-show freak?
- Don't be ridiculous.
You're pushing your program for his intellectual development too rapidly.
It has to keep pace with my program for his emotional development... or the imbalance will become dangerous.
I thought we were to be satisfied with a minor miracle...
- What are you afraid of?
...help a retarded human being... become a more productive member of society.
He has shown no indication of any mental ceiling.
So why are you afraid to reach for whatever that ceiling may be?
In any event, we shall have to give
Mrs. Kinnian her notice.
What?
All she can do now is ask him questions out of books that he's already absorbed.
What he needs at this point is a giant step forward.
New conceptualization. Inductive thinking.
That calls for experts, not Alice Kinnian.
I will say it once more, Richard.
Charly Gordon is still a child emotionally.
I don't agree.
Yes?
Charly, what is it?
I brought you a present.
Okay, come in.
Very nice of you.
What's the occasion?
I just wanted you to have a present.
Sit down.
Lovely paper.
Charly, it's so beautiful.
Must have been terribly expensive.
You like it?
It's beautiful but it's too much.
Just beautiful. Thank you.
He only kissed you on the cheek.
He?
Frank.
Have you been spying on me?
I've been falling in love with you.
No.
These feelings aren't what you think.
It isn't love...
We have fun working together... but you have to understand that between...
You think anyone would ever want you?
You stupid moron!
I saw your cycle outside.
It's for sale.
What did you learn?
I'm back.
What did you learn?
I'm here.
- Marry me, Alice.
- Charly...
I could never keep up with you, and I don't want to hold you back.
- And I don't want to be left behind.
- Einstein had a wife.
Didn't Einstein say... that everything was in motion, that nothing ever stands still?
Marry me, pretty girl, marry me.
We will marry at quarter past Wednesday... on the 7 4th of November... and our anniversary will happily be... on those days when we both remember.
Ever been anywhere?
Someday.
Portugal is straight ahead.
I can smell the olives.
Ship ahoy.
Abandoned schooner off the starboard bow.
Want to ship out?
Okay, where are the sails?
Who needs sails?
As captain of this ship,
I now declare us man and wife.
I signed on only as first mate.
You know what's going to happen in the year 2o18?
I'm never gonna let this year end.
It will be our golden wedding anniversary.
Charly, let's worry about breakfast.
Think Algernon has found a wife?
Or his true love.
The plural of mouse is mice.
The plural of spouse must be spice?
They say, Charly... that true love... is letting go.
What's enough love?
Always a little more... than anyone ever gets.
Please, could we stop these recriminations... and use the time to decide tomorrow's program?
All right, you still really believe he'll be here?
But, of course. You were on the extension, you heard them...
How do we know what's happened to Charly in the past four weeks?
Whether he's learned more or not?
We have no immediate evaluation...
May we concentrate on the presentation?
All right, what are your ideas on the programming?
How much time shall we program for Algernon and the Phase 5 mice?
I thought we agreed to eliminate that part of the presentation.
No, I did not agree to that.
It is essential to show the entire graph of Algernon's various stages.
In my opinion, we should concentrate on Charly... the preoperative testing, and then you cap it all off... by bringing him out on stage.
Why don't you just leave the programming to me?
You know, sometimes you give me the feeling you have already... written your acceptance speech for the ceremonies in Stockholm.
Bravo!
You made us lose a lot of valuable time.
Time, as you've often taught me, Professor, is relative... as it creeps on in its petty pace from day to day.
- To the last syllable of recorded time.
- Edgar Allen Shakespeare.
- You both look happy!
- I have never felt happier.
There were no telephones where you were, Mrs. Kinnian... no post offices until yesterday?
I didn't have a dime, I didn't have a stamp,
I didn't have the time!
She didn't have a dime, time, or the inclination.
- Hi, Charly, Mrs. Kinnian!
- Bert, how are you? How's Algernon?
Last week he said hello to me in Sanskrit.
What did you say to him?
What do you say to a mouse that says hello in Sanskrit?
I said hello!
Homecoming! We've still got a little champagne left.
Champagne with a plastic top: symbol of our times.
Now that you're here,
I want to run over tomorrow's program.
Very well. What would you like... a treatise on photosynthesis and its effect on fourth-generation computers?
By the way, how do your surgical techniques work on retarded computers?
And you, Dr. Straus... what would you like for emotional effect?
Would you like... an ideational activity or would you like fragmented self-image?
I would like a drink.
- Fragmented grape.
- Thank you.
Come on, Professor, cheer up.
After tomorrow... you're gonna be on the cover of Time and Newsweek.
And you, Dr. Straus, are gonna be in the centerfold of Playboy.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor at this time to present to you... the distinguished Dr. Richard Nemur... and his colleague, Dr. Anna Straus... who are responsible for the Algernon-Gordon effect.
You are all acquainted with their eminent qualifications... through their published papers...
I told you we're not using the Phase 5 group.
I asked Bert to bring them.
Some of the behavioral psychologists might care to see them.
Is that advisable?
I think it is absolutely essential that...
Dr. Anna Straus and Dr. Richard Nemur.
Learned colleagues... the presentation today will deal first...
Give me a cigarette.
...aspects of the Algernon-Gordon effect... which my associate will cover.
- Thanks.
- I didn't know you smoked.
I don't.
Listen...
- There's absolutely no need to be nervous.
- No.
There's only a few hundred of the world's most eminent scientists out there.
- No reason to be nervous.
- Never mind about them.
- You are talking directly to me.
- Yes.
Will you stand where I can see you?
Right there.
Let me know.
...resulted in a maverick enzyme... of the kind which induces... defective biochemical reaction and causes brain damage.
Fortunately, while the destruction to the tissue is irreversible... the protein process is not.
Many researchers are able to reverse the process through control of chemicals... which combine with the defective enzymes... and change the molecular shape of the interfering key, as it were.
This is also central in our technique.
But first we remove the damaged portions of the brain... and permit the implanted tissues... which have been chemically revitalized... to produce brain protein... at an accelerated and supernormal rate.
Dr. Straus.
And now we would like to show you... a film study of Charly Gordon... when he first came to the clinic.
Got my... rabbit's foot.
That's very good. Shoes, gloves.
Shoes and gloves...
- You wear them.
- That's right.
Morning, afternoon.
You don't have to worry about passing or failing. Not these tests.
Morning, afternoon...
That's a very funny face, Charly.
That was Charly Gordon then.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you... to meet Charly Gordon now.
Are there any questions?
Did you enjoy the film?
Mr. Gordon... how do you feel at the present moment about your development?
Grateful, sir.
- You are happy about it?
- Yes.
Why?
Because it has allowed me to see.
To see what?
The world.
And what do you see in that world?
My eyes are new, Doctor.
What do they see, Mr. Gordon?
Things as they are.
And?
And what they are becoming.
Can you give me an example, Mr. Gordon?
No, sir, you give me one.
Very well.
Modern science.
Rampant technology.
Conscience by computer.
Modern art.
Dispassionate draftsmen.
- Foreign policy.
- Brave new weapons.
- Today's youth.
- Joyless, guideless.
- Today's religion.
- Preachment by popularity polls.
- Standard of living.
- A TV in every room.
- Education.
- A TV in every room!
The world's future, Mr. Gordon.
Brave new hates, brave new bombs, brave new wars.
- The coming generation.
- Test-tube conception, laboratory birth...
TV education, brave new dreams, brave new hates, brave new wars... a beautifully purposeless process of society suicide.
Any more questions?
In the back, any more questions about things as they are... and what they're becoming?
No?
I have a question.
Professor Nemur...
Charly Gordon?
Come on, Professor, you know.
You know, but you haven't told me.
Anybody out there answer the question
"Charly Gordon?"
Anyone in the back answer the question
"Charly Gordon?"
No.
Well, I'm disappointed in you doctors.
You're not very smart.
You're not even as smart as a mouse.
Because he knows.
Algernon showed me.
The answer to the question...
"Charly Gordon?" is:
Charly Gordon... is a fellow... who will very shortly be... what he used to be.
Professor Nemur... why didn't you tell me... the success of the operation... was only temporary?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Let me buy you a drink.
- No.
- I wish you would.
- Waitress.
The entire Phase 5 group... all the same as Algernon.
Not one of the mice is capable anymore of solving the simplest problem.
Did you find him?
Why didn't you tell me?
Why did you have to hide it?
But we only discovered an indication of this condition last week, Mrs. Kinnian... and only in a few of the Phase 5 mice.
I assumed it was simply erratic behavior, individual behavior.
There was no need to alarm Charly!
With the convention coming up, why should you both miss your moments of glory?
Before we could run further checks, he had no right to make it public.
- No right?
- Have you any idea what he's done... to our standing in the scientific community?
Let us calmly, dispassionately, try to decide what we are going to do...
- About this situation.
- Which situation?
- Your standing or Charly?
- They're related, you know.
Is that all this means to you?
But don't you understand, Mrs. Kinnian?
Algernon's regression doesn't prove it will happen to Charly.
Charly's a human being, not a laboratory animal.
This regressive syndrome may be limited to the mice.
I will thank you...
Have you been close to something, but not close enough?
Is there a second operation you can give him, some corrective surgery?
- No.
- I see.
What do you do here with the specimens that fail?
The freezer first, then the incinerator?
How can I help?
Consider the human brain as an information-processing system... of several parts.
The cortical surface consisting of distributed in logic arrays... various multi-directional buses and distributing converters... for converting synaptic memory into DNA storage.
One area for investigation is the doctors' hypothesis... that the mind can be permanently improved... through surgery and enzyme enrichment... thereby utilizing unused portions of the brain. Can you program that?
It's a little vague, Mr. Gordon.
Could you give me more detailed specs?
It correlates to what we've already programmed on DNA conversion.
I see. Can we use the same system?
Right. Just change the variables.
Is mental improvement temporary because it lacks appropriate DNA conversion... because of a storage limitation, which tends to overload and disable the repaired area?
Any combination of those factors?
Run it.
Assuming the brain neurons store information on a temporary basis only... let's assume...
Thank you, this one's finished.
Assuming the brain neurons store information on a temporary basis only... let us assume that this information... is subsequently coded into DNA molecules... permitting storage of far more material than the nerves could hold by themselves.
It could be that this transformation takes place during sleep... and is indeed one of the purposes and needs for sleeping... and for dreaming.
Simulating brain damage.
Comparing homologous lesions in the tissue of animals... and corresponding...
It requires no great stretch of imagination to visualize a possible connection... between protein synthesis and...
And what?
Perhaps the only possible answer... to our question is, whatever we said the mind is, we'll discover it's not.
It may be that we've been... trying to capture something which is scientifically...
Which by its very nature... is scientifically premature.
Charly, go...
Go home, Charly.
You'll work better in the morning.
I'm finished.
My work is finished.
That's good.
Then you can go home... and sleep for at least two days.
These tapes will have to be programmed.
Could they do it tonight?
If you go home and sleep.
I'd rather wait.
Might take all night.
I'll wait.
Your evaluations were correct.
That's too bad.
- It was such a promising theory.
- It is.
It still is.
Thank you.
Felt like coffee.
Everything's closed.
Not at Charly Gordon's.
Open 24 hours a day, you know that.
- Hungry? Want some eggs?
- No, just coffee.
I hope it's not too strong.
Marry me, Charly.
Now.
Tonight.
I'll get you a spoon.
Marry me.
All right, don't marry me.
Motion carried.
But I'm gonna stay. Right here.
Whenever you feel like telling me to go, just tell me so. I'll go.
Leave.
Please leave.
All right.
Good night.
Good night.
[ Man Speaking Over P.A.,

- Mr. Hamilton?
- Yes?
[ Bell Clanging ]
Scarsdale is next.
[ Bell Clanging ]
[ Brakes Screeching ]
[ Engine Starts ]
Good day?
Mm-hmm.
- You?
- Very productive.
Got the roses out in back all trimmed.
Oh, letter this morning from Sally.
Sam's finished internship.
Starts practice next week.
Well, he should specialize.
That's the only thing now.
Well, maybe he just wants to get the feel of things.
Our little girl’s done all right.
[ Children Shouting, Chattering ]
Something wrong?
No.
That phone call last night?
What about it?
I heard you pacing around in the study afterward... till almost 2:00.
Just a crazy prank.
Look, Emily, it was nothing.
[ Rings ]
[ Man ]
Art? It's me again.
Arthur? Arthur!
Look, I don't know who you are, but —
- Charlie Evans.
- Stop saying that!
Charlie Evans is dead.
Now, I want you to stop this, or I'll be forced to call the police.
Art, there are two trophies on the fireplace... near the tennis team picture.
Pick up the phone and walk over to them.
Go ahead.
You know the cord will reach.
Are you there?
Yes.
In the picture, you and I are standing with our arms... around each other's shoulder.
We're both wearing the same kind of wristwatch.
- Remember, we gave them to each other after winning the doubles at Princeton?
- Yes.
Okay.
Take the doubles trophy there and turn it over.
One edge of the felt is loose.
Pull it back.
[ Charlie ]
"Fidelis eternis."
You scratched it there down in the locker room... after we won the finals.
Remember?
With your belt buckle.
I —
I had forgotten.
I didn't.
It can't be you.
Okay, now.
Listen very carefully.
- Did you get the address today?
- Yes.
Good.
You're to use the name "Wilson."
You — you can't be Charlie.
You just don't come back.
I'm alive!
More alive than I've been in the past 25 years.
You've got to come tomorrow.
Arthur, listen.
If you don't show up, that's it.
Think, for pete's sake!
What have you got now?
What?
I don't know.
Tomorrow, just past noon.
Remember:
Use the name "Wilson."
I... don't know.
- I won't call again, buddy.
- [ Line Clicks ]
- Charlie?
- [ Dial Tone ]
Charlie?
- Was it that call again?
- No.
Stop cross-examining me every time the phone rings.
Understand?
Perfectly.
I'm, uh, sorry.
[ Gulps ]
Excuse me.
You're excused.
Any fever?
No, just old faithful.
Make an appointment to see
Dr. Hogan tomorrow, hmm?
I will.
Promise?
Promise. Thank you.
Therefore... in view of the differential... between your present equity —
[ Door Buzzer Sounds ] between your present equity and the amount necessary... for... capitalization... we cannot extend the loan you require.
Should your equity —
Where?
- Uh, "Should your equity —"
- Oh, yeah.
Should your equity increase, do not hesitate to call on us... for a personal reappraisal, et cetera, et cetera.
Standard closing.
Yes, sir.
[ Buzzer Sounds ]
[ Steam Hissing ]
My name is, uh, Wilson.
I was told to —
I was told to come here.
Look, is this the place or isn't it?
- [ Steam Hissing ]
- [ Man ] They aren't here anymore.
I got it wrote down.
Thank you.
Move it! Let's go, let's go!
Move it down the line!
Let's go, you bunch of idiots!
Get that beef cut down!
Let's go! Move it up!
Damn you guys! Let's get that truck going and get the meat the hell outta here!
Go on! What are you gonna do?
Take all day?
[ Man #1 ] Come on, move!
Don't let those hooks fall off.
Come on, let's move it!
Okay, Toddy.
Give us another truck up here.
Tighten up with it, now.
Ah, Mr. Wilson.
- Let's go. On the truck with them.
- Surely this isn't the —
- No, sir. Please come with me.
- Let's go, Frank!
Move that truck off.
Come on, now.
Let's hook it off.
Hook on.
Move that beef off the line!
Let's go!
This is costing money, you bunch of jerks!
Come on! Go! Go!
Come on, cut it down.
Cut it! Cut it!
All right, come on!
Move out!
Keep hooking that beef up.
Cut it down. Let's go.
Would you step in, please, sir?
I'd much prefer to ride in front, if you don't mind.
I'm sorry, sir, but customers are asked to ride in the back.
Oh.
Your hat, sir.
It's only a short ride.
Thank you.
We're here, sir.
Would you take the elevator to your left, sir?
Ah, Mr. Wilson.
Will you come this way, please?
Yes.
I'm very sorry.
There'll be a short delay.
- Perhaps you'd like tea and a sandwich.
- Thank you.
All right.
Make yourself comfortable.
Here we go.
[ Door Shuts ]
[ No Audio ]
Uh, pardon me... but could you tell me the way out of this building?
Excuse me.
I was wondering if you could tell —
Excuse me.
I'm trying to find —
Excuse me. I'm trying to find my way out of the building.
I have a gentleman here who wishes to leave the building.
[ Woman ]
Yes, that would be Mr. Wilson.
Would you have him return to Mr. Ruby's office, please?
Mr. Ruby is waiting for him there.
They want you down at the end of the corridor again.
Yes. All right.
Thank you.
[ Man ]
Ah, there you are, Mr. Wilson.
Come in, please.
Would you close the door?
Please, sit down.
My name is Ruby.
I've been assigned to go over the circumstances of your death with you.
- What?
- I know this seems rather strange to you.
That's why I'm here.
You probably have a lot of questions.
Of course, the subject might appear indelicate, but most of our clients —
Now, get this straight:
I am not a client.
- Precisely, Mr. Wilson.
You are not a client yet.
- [ Door Opens ]
Let me start by explaining... the cost factor involved.
To begin with... the procedure is a rather complex one.
This seems to be your supper.
Oh, the chicken looks delicious.
No, thank you.
Yes, as I was saying, the cost runs... in the neighborhood of $30,000.
I know this seems rather high, but in addition... to the rather extensive... cosmetic renovation by way of plastic surgery for you...
CPS has to provide a fresh corpse that perfectly matches... your physical dimensions and medical specifications.
"CPS"?
Oh, Cadaver Procurement Section.
You sure you don't want this chicken?
Absolutely sure.
Oh, pity.
The next step is... the carefully planned obliteration... of identifiable portions of the cadaver... before it is found.
Features, dental structure, fingerprints.
We can't leave anything to chance.
No, I — I guess not.
Uh, would you mind if, uh —
Please.
Thank you.
Now, there is a problem — that the circumstances of your death must be simple.
Well, a simple accident, strangely enough... is costly, Mr. Wilson.
The trick lies in obliterating... just so much and no more, so that... an identification still can be made, based on... as I say, general dimensions... plus a credible sequence of events... witnesses, et cetera.
Oh, the whole thing must be very carefully staged.
We guarantee a death of this kind.
Mm, excuse me.
Delicious!
They have a wonderful way of baking cheese on it... so that it gets very crispy.
Now, there are any number of ways... you can be found.
Excuse me. I mean your body can be found.
The victim of some kind of machinery, an explosion... um, a hunting misadventure.
Oh, but I think these are somewhat too gross for you.
I had thought perhaps a hotel room fire.
Would you like me to outline the circumstances?
- No, thank you.
- Oh, good. I was —
- I was hoping you would agree —
- No!
I mean, I-I can't be sure.
Oh, well, of course, of course, of course.
We can't expect you to decide all at once.
Um, think it over.
There's so much else to be done, Mr. Wilson... but if I may say so... the question of death selection may be the most important decision in your life.
[ Door Opens ]
Ah, here are the trust instruments.
Mr. Joliffe, Mr. Brown,
Mr. Wilson.
My colleagues.
This is your, uh, revised will... drawn in accordance with the requirements of the trust... all predated, of course, to save you the trouble.
Oh, no, no.
It's standard procedure.
Uh... effective at the time of your death... the trust provides for... very liberal settlements on your wife and daughter... and more-than-sufficient funds... for your financial needs and your new identity... from sums assigned to us as your trustees.
Insurance policies... uh, annuities... uh, real estate.
If you'll, uh, sign right here.
The staging here is rather authentic, you'll see.
Of course, the drug made it easier to manipulate you... into the proper positions and attitudes.
Rest easy, Mr. Wilson.
You did not ravage our girl.
Of course, the photography is not too professional... but I think it's clear enough.
- So now it's —
- I have a message from Charlie.
Charlie?
He wanted me to tell you that rebirth is painful.
You were going to say...
"So now it's blackmail," eh, Mr. Wilson?
- What would you call it?
- Just a kind of insurance.
Isn't it easier to go forward when you know you can't go back?
But you knew that, didn't you?
The minute you hung up with Charlie after that first call.
Ah, sure you did.
You're saying...
I can never go back?
Fact is, you really don't want to go back.
Sakes, boy!
You owe yourself this thing.
Rebirth. Life again.
Begin again, all new, all different.
The way you always wanted it.
You got another chance.
Heck, nobody's gonna miss you, are they?
- My wife.
- What about her?
What are you to her now?
- We get along.
- What does that mean?
There's my daughter.
Mm-hmm.
We don't see much of her, actually.
She lives out west with her husband.
She writes now and then, uh... to let us —
What are you to her now?
Excuse an old fool prying, son... but what does it all mean?
Hmm?
It can't mean anything now, anymore.
There's nothing anymore, is there?
Anything at all?
I... expect to be president of the bank before too long.
And I have my boat in the summer.
We have friends.
Anything at all?
I guess I... never thought much about it before.
I leave Emily pretty much alone to do what she, uh —
We get along, as I said.
We hardly ever quarrel.
Not that that's any... measure of our lives.
Frankly... during the last few years, we... hardly ever... ever —
I — I don't know why I'm telling you this.
'Cause you want to.
Go on.
Ever... ever... showed much affection.
But as I said — boat.
And, uh —
So this is what happens to the dreams of youth.
Go on, son. Let it out.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Let it out.
Hmm?
It's time for a change.
Now, look.
They'll both be well taken care of.
They don't need you, and you don't need them.
You just can't help each other anymore.
Ah, look, son.
You know what I'm saying is true.
There's nothing anymore.
No, no.
What you need now is a good rest.
Now, there a few things to be worked out in the morning... but my boys will clear those up, and you needn't worry none.
- Your boys?
- Mm-hmm.
You're the head of it all?
There never was a struggle in the soul of a good man that wasn't hard.
My papa told me that... and it's sure enough true.
Believe me, son.
I know.
I believe you.
That's fine.
[ Man ] You know, Mr. Wilson, you represent something of a milestone around here.
When the bandages are removed...
I think you'll be more than pleased.
In fact, I expect you to be prancing around here like a stud bull.
Now, it's gonna take a while, so, uh... try to be patient until we get you ready for the world again.
- [ Whimpers ]
- Now, don't do that!
You can't talk because we've extracted all your teeth... and given you a complete vocal cord resection.
- [ Gasps ]
- Give the tissues time to pull together.
Now, you got a new set of permanent teeth.
In a week you won't know the difference. Thank you.
That's what hurts most right now.
Everything's different.
When the first healing's over, we'll start conditioning for muscle tone.
- Hmm?
- [ Raspy Groan ]
Yes, yes. Those too.
Fingerprints.
Mr. Wilson, even your signature.
Little thing we did with the tensor ligaments of the hand.
[ Rasping ]
The orbicularis or is started to sag, so we tightened them with ligatures.
Yeah.
Then we worked on the mandible to square up the bone.
Uh-huh.
Well, I never.
[ Chuckles ]
Holy mackerel.
I don't know how you boys do it.
Doc, it's a masterpiece.
Good work.
Easy does it.
You'll be all right, son.
Your scars and hematomas will disappear in a couple of weeks.
After several months of physical conditioning... the process will be complete.
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
Ah.
My name is Davalo.
I'm your guidance adviser.
This is about your future career.
I'm afraid I haven't thought very much about that.
Oh, yes, you have, sir.
[ Chuckles ]
- Permit me.
- [ Arthur's Voice ] I want a ball...
- a big, big red one.
- Whoops.
I'm afraid we picked this up a little too early.
Sit down. We recorded these regressions... under Pentothal and caffeine sodium benzoate.
At first, there's always a touch of the infantile... but later on, we progress to a more mature... expressional infrastructure.
Ah, here we are.
[ Davalo's Voice ]
What would you like to do most of all?
[ Arthur's Voice ]
Of anything in the whole world?
[ Davalo's Voice ]
Mm-hmm.
[ Arthur's Voice ]
Uh...
I'd like to be a tennis pro, I guess.
Yes.
That's what I'd like best of all.
[ Davalo's Voice ]
Mm-hmm.
And suppose you couldn't be?
What else would you choose?
[ Arthur's Voice ]
Uh...
I guess I'd like to paint stuff.
[ Davalo's Voice ]
Pictures?
[ Arthur's Voice ]
Pictures and things.
Well...
I think the creative wish pattern is pretty self-evident.
You mean, I —
I ought to be a painter?
Exactly!
You see, painting allows you a basic creative outlet... as well as providing an environment... in which these sublimations will have free vent.
Now, let's take a look at the program we've worked out for you.
Certificates of study.
Abroad.
Notices of first six one-man shows.
Your pictures are realistic in treatment... but deal with poetic imagery in choice of subject.
Not that I pretend to be a critic of painting.
These diplomas... from reputable universities... they — they can't be forged.
Mr. Wilson, I assure you... every item is bona fide and valid.
How-How could I even approach such a professional level? I couldn't —
Oh, very simple.
You are already established in a position of some dignity.
Oh, nothing conspicuous.
Just a solid, mildly successful sort of thing.
You will be supplied with fresh paintings periodically.
In time, you'll perfect your own style.
Surreal, primitive, impressionistic — whatever.
It will be a transition from this present work.
You see... you don't have to prove anything anymore.
You are accepted.
You will be in your own new dimension.
You're a bachelor.
Birth certificate.
The only son... of deceased parents, and so forth.
In short... you are alone in the world... absolved of all responsibility... except to your own interest.
Isn't that marvelous?
[ Man's Voice ]
Your studio is in Malibu, California.
Quite luxurious. Very private.
You'll make your own adjustment in your own way... in your own time.
Oh, you'll be self-conscious at first.
Don't worry.
[ Chuckles ]
It will wear off.
And remember —
You've got what almost every middle-aged man... in America would like to have: freedom.
Real freedom.
[ Chuckling ]
Ah, it's been a pleasure,
Mr. Wilson.
[ Woman ]
Pillow, Mr. Wilson?
Yes, thank you.
[ Woman Speaking Over P.A.,
Indistinct ]
[ Man ]
Tony! Tony?
Tony Wilson!
Hey there, you old rascal!
Slow down!
Where's the fire?
Can't wait to get back to them pretty little models, huh?
Uh-oh. I am late.
Now, if I didn't have to catch me a plane,
I'd make you buy me a drink, by God!
See you soon. Gotta run.
[ Man ]
Welcome home, Mr. Wilson.
My name is John.
I've been assigned to help you.
It's very nice.
I think you'll be quite comfortable, sir.
Do you like your studio?
- Yes.
- Perhaps you'd like to freshen up and have a drink.
Afterward, I'll try to clear up any point on which you may have curiosity.
The bath is through here.
I'll unpack these for you later.
Fine.
Um... how long will you be here, um —
John, sir.
For as long as you need me.
The company is fully aware that you may have problems at first...
- and will spare no effort to help you solve them.
- Thank you.
Yes, sir.
- John?
- Yes, sir?
I, uh —
I had a curious experience at the airport.
What was that?
Well, I was accosted by a man who called me by name.
He seemed to know me, and I'm certain I've never met him.
I suppose it was a mistake on his part.
So it would appear, sir.
What kind of people live here?
Professionals.
Some in business. Some write.
No, uh, no artists, I hope.
I think you are the only one, sir.
If I may suggest, sir... perhaps you'd like to give a small cocktail party for the immediate neighbors.
Oh, well, I, uh —
I'd better get myself used to things first.
Later on, maybe.
As you wish, sir.
That's very good, sir.
Thank you.
Wouldn't you enjoy meeting some of the people here, sir?
I told you
I'm not ready yet, John.
I'll do this in my own way and in my own time.
Of course, sir.
Hello.
Hey. Hey, wait.
I'm sorry about back there.
How about if we try it again?
Hello.
I'm Nora Marcus.
I'm... Tony Wilson.
- Walk?
- Sure.
[ Nora Laughing ]
Ocean, I love you!
You're beautiful!
Beautiful!
[ Laughing ]
All that power, and she's got all the answers.
Hey!
Got a question!
[ Sighs ]
What did you ask?
Oh, a tough one:
"Who and what is Tony Wilson?"
And what did it say?
It told me to mind my own business.
[ Nora's Voice ] That was my life.
Two boys, ages ten and twelve.
Successful and indulgent husband.
A beautiful house, complete with microwave oven... intercom, station wagon, et cetera, et cetera.
Ad infinitum.
Ad... absurdum.
And?
I made myself a cup of coffee, dressed, and left.
- That was four years ago.
- And you never went back?
I've seen them from time to time, but... it's different now.
Maybe because I'm different.
I don't expect you to understand.
I think I do.
You?
An artist?
Why should you understand?
You spent your whole life being.
You don't know anything about me, really.
Oh, yes, I do.
It's all right there in your face.
What is?
- Now you're fishing.
- No. Seriously.
This may hurt a little.
I agreed to take my chances.
Okay.
Madam Marcus will read the leaves.
What kind of a man is he?
There's grace in the line and color, but... it doesn't emerge pure.
It pushes at the edge of something still... tentative... unresolved, as if... somewhere in the man... there is still a key unturned.
That's quite an analysis.
Not really.
When you come to think of it, it sort of fits everybody, doesn't it?
It's very nice here.
The good things always happen with the rain.
When will I see you again?
I'm going to Santa Barbara tomorrow.
There's a kind of gathering.
Can I come?
It's going to be very wild.
Maybe that's part of turning the key.

- Come dance with me.
- Nora, I don't know any of these people.
- I don't think I —
- Don't "think" me, Tony. Don't.
I came here to feel, to be.
I'm dying, and that's the world... the whole bloody world!
Nora, it's not a question of dancing.
I'm not a part of this!
- I'm dying, and that's the world!

- Thank you, John.
- Oh, Mr. Wilson.
- May I present Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd?
- How do you do?
This is your host, Mr. Wilson.
- Mr. Filter, Mr. Wilson.
- Pleased to meet you.
How do you do, Tony?
- Hello, Mr. Wilson.
- You have seen Tony's paintings, haven't you?
## [ Piano Jazz ]
Cheers.
Mr. Wilson, may
I present Mr. Mayberry?
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Wilson.
Peekaboo.
- Honey, please slow down.
- Never!
Never!
Come. I'm taking you to ze Casbah.
[ Nora ]
Not ze Casbah!
As soon as these people leave,
I'm going to attack you.
Why, Mr. Wilson, you dirty old man!
Ah!
[ Low Chuckle ]
- I really am.
- Hmm.
I want you to know that.
I'm counting on it.
Miss Marcus, you shock me.
Tony, please ease up.
Hmm-mm.
- Why?
- Because... it's not like you.
[ Drunkenly ]
Oh, I know that.
I'm sorry.
[ Exhales ]
Guess I just needed the added strength.
Oh, that's silly.
They're all wonderful people.
Just give them a chance.
- Okay, okay.
- Give yourself a chance.
- Hmm?
- Okay.
Yes?
I promise. No more.
And I promise to behave myself.
[ Gasps ]
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I've embarrassed you.
No, you haven't.
Tony...
I think I love you.
You're beautiful!
You're —
- You're an ocean.
- Let's go back.
The sooner we get rid of those people... the sooner we can be together.
- I'm going to hold you to your promise.
- Oh, God. You're evil!
- Yes!
- God, how evil you are!
Tony?
Henry Bushman, my husband.
- Nice to know you, Wilson.
- How do you do?
- Nora, you're staggering.
- Hank, that's a dirty lie.
Watch out for this character.
He's a lawyer.
Harvard, I want you to know.
- Really? Hey, that's a coincidence.
- Hold it!
- Thank you.
- Mm, me too. In fact, me too twice.
Hollow leg again?
Oh, will you listen? At home he makes me look like a piker.
A veritable piker.
Henry, you sneaking two-face, you.
- Private joke?
- No. I'm sorry.
Come on, Nora.
Let's ditch these two sots.
- [ Gasps ] Help, Tony! Rape!
- Wait a minute. You can't do that.
No, there's no way you'll get away.
You're gonna stay right here.
But that's my woman.
Hey. Hey!
Hey, that's funny.
That's very funny.
What's funny?
Is he really a sneaky two-face?
Yes.
There's such a religious climate out here. Don't you agree?
- Oh, I love the climate.
- Yes.
I belong to a special kind of group.
Nothing subversive, I hope.
Oh, good heavens, no!
We change sects.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, no, no. Good heavens.
You thought I meant —
"Sects." S-E-C-T-S.
- Oh, sects!
- Yes.
Well, thank God!
- We change every month.
Right now, we're in Aztec.
- Mm!
Huitzilopochtli, Quetzalcoatl, virgin sacrifice and all.
- I just love your paintings, Mr. Wilson.
- ## [ Up-tempo Rock ]
How do you ever do it?
Well, you see... it all began with a big red ball... and, uh —
No, no.
You see...
I paint naked, Mrs. Filter.
- It's the only way to get at the truth.
- How interesting.
Of course. You see, in this way, my inner essence is revealed... and I am presented to the canvas... in direct relationship with my primeval state... without its sociological trappings.
- Hey, watch it, will ya?
- Oh, look!
- Take it easy, Wilson!
- I'm sorry.
- I'm terribly sorry.
- You all right, hon?
John! John?
- That'll never come out. Never!
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Excuse me. Please forgive me.
- Just look at this mess!
It's all right, ma'am.
May I?
[ John ]
Let me take that.
I'm sure it won't stain badly.
Hey! You two heard the one about the —
[ Both ]
Yes, we have.
Well, I'm — Well, I'm sorry.
I — I didn't mean to interrupt.
Seems like I'm... doing everything wrong lately.
Now, don't pout. Mama will make everything better, okay?
Perfect. Say, Hank... uh, I was thinking about school just before... and, uh, your house at Harvard... wasn't, by any chance,
Adams, was it?
- No, not exactly.
- Is anybody hungry?
Hey, I am.
Say, Hank?
Hank!
Hey, Hank. Here.
Hank, actually — actually, I'm not a Harvard alumnus either.
That is, I used to be, but I'm not anymore.
- [ Woman ] What do you mean?
Did you resign?
- Take it easy.
- Oh, that's priceless!
- No!
- I did go to Harvard, you see...
- Uh-huh. and I was an alumnus... but that was before
I became a painter... and now I'm not anymore.
Come on, Hank!
# Poor Eli's hopes we're dashing #
# Into blue obscurity #
# Resistless, our team sweeps goalward #

That's wonderful!
Absolutely wonderful!
Truth is, I just stopped being an alumnus.
- Oh.
- Simple.
- Wilson!
- What?
You and I must play golf sometime.
Golf? Golf?

Antiochus Wilson playing golf?
Huh? Now...

Looks as if our host is in orbit.

Hey, wait a minute, you guys.
[ Woman Laughing ]
- Incoming! Good-bye!
- Bye!
Oh, isn't he wonderful?
[ Tony Laughing ]
- Put him down.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Turn him around.
- Hey, Hank, listen.
Hey, Hank,
I got a nephew —
I got a nephew right — right in Harvard right now!
- You don't have a nephew.
- What?
[ Laughs ]
I don't have a nephew!
[ Scoffs ]
Okay, correct.
I don't have a nephew... but he's there, all right.
He's there, all right.
My daughter... she's married to a doctor... and maybe by this time,
I'm a grandfather.
Believe me... they'll never drag it out of me.
I'll stand right here... on my constitutional rights.
I'm not a grandfather.
I —
[ Chuckles ] Why are you all staring at me like that?
[ Laughs ]
Hey, John?
[ Laughing ]
Hey, John!
Why are they —
Hey, John. Hey, John... why are they staring at me like that?
- They know.
- [ Laughing ]
They know what?
They're like you.
What do you mean?
Reborns.

Oh, Lord!

Now, listen to me. Arthur —
Charlie?
- Now, look, Arthur —
- Charlie.
- Arthur, listen to me!
- Is it really you?
Of course it is.
Do you realize how dangerous it is, what you're doing? Do you?
I've got to get out of here.
You don't know what they're doing to me.
Come on, now, buddy.
Calm down. Calm down.
- I've got to see you.
- That's impossible right now.
- Why?
- It just is!
You've got to get a hold of yourself, fast. You'll be sorry —
- You know what they did?
- I can't explain, but you'll be —
There's this reborn, Nora.
She's not one of them.
She works for the company.
- What?
- That's right.
An employee.
But I —
Oh, no. She was so —
Why, Charlie? Why?
Your adjustment was bound to be difficult in the first stages.
Don't you see?
The company simply provided —
An employee.
It means a lot to me personally, Arthur.
Now, I can't explain... but we're sort of tied together, you and me.
We're so close, Arthur.
Don't throw it away.
- How?
- Trust, please?
Promise to stay put until we can get someone to you.
[ Charlie's Voice Continues ]
You've got to have some help right now.
Please, will you do it?
Will you stay there?
Please!
Yes?
- I'm Mr. Wilson.
- Yes, sir.
Come in, please.
I'll tell Mrs. Hamilton you're here.
[ Emily ]
Mr. Wilson?
I'm so glad you were able to come.
- Thank you. I didn't mean to barge in.
- Oh, not at all.
It was very kind of you.
I must have sounded strange over the phone, but... you see,
Arthur never mentioned —
Well, I just met your late husband last year, shortly before —
Yes. Um, please, sit down.
Mrs. Hamilton, I'm a painter — an artist, actually.
- I admire your husband's watercolors.
- Really?
Not that he was professional... but he did have something.
He mentioned some paintings in a cupboard out in the garage.
That's the reason I —
Well, I was wondering if I might... pick one up as a memento.
I'm sorry, but the garage has been cleaned out.
You threw them away?
No.
No, not exactly.
You have a lovely place here.
Oh, thank you.
This was the study, wasn't it?
Yes, it was —
How did you know?
Your husband... talked a lot about this house, about his family.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to stir up painful memories.
No. No, it's not that.
It's just that...
I never knew Arthur to do that very much.
How do you mean?
- I don't want to bore you.
- No, please.
I'd like to know.
You see...
I knew him only for a short while.
I'd really like to know.
It's not just curiosity.
We, uh —
We shared an interest in art.
The last time I saw him, I —
I did some sketches.
Now I'd like to do a painting... but all I have are lines... a face.
Posthumous portraiture, hmm?
I'm not joking, Mrs. Hamilton.
No, of course you're not.
I'm sorry. I —
You've set me quite a task.
He was a quiet man.
I think the thing I most remember him for were his silences.
It was... as if he were always listening to something inside... some voice.
He never talked about it, so I never knew what it was.
Oh, he was a good man... but he lived as if he were a stranger here.
I mean, he never let anything touch him.
He became absorbed in things — his job, mostly.
He worked hard. He... became more detached.
Always a look around his eyes as if he were... trying to say something.
I don't know what.
Protest against what he'd surrendered his life to?
I never knew what he wanted... and I don't think he ever knew.
He fought so hard for what he'd been taught to want... and when he got it, he just grew more and more confused.
The silences grew longer.
We never talked about it.
We lived our lives in a polite... celibate truce.
You see, Arthur had been dead a long, long time... before they found him in that hotel room.
Well, I... guess
I can't tell you much more.
Enough?
Yes, it is.
I really should be going.
Well, I... hope
I've been some help.
Yes, you have.
Very much.
[ Emily's Voice ]
Mr. Wilson?
You said that you wanted a memento.
It won't be a painting, I'm afraid, but it's all I have.
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson.
It doesn't matter.
- I want to go back.
- Of course, sir.
No, I don't mean to California.
To the company.
Start again, all over.
Antiochus Wilson can die, can't he, John?
The company.
Is it possible?
I think so, sir.
[ Exhales ]
Begin again.
Quite honestly...
I'm not the least bit sorry... because there were certain mistakes made in my case, and —
Of course, but before we go into all that, let me ask you... whether you can recommend and sponsor a new client.
What?
Someone in your acquaintance outside... whom you feel would benefit by the company's services.
You were sponsored yourself, you know.
Oh, yes, of course.
A business associate, perhaps.
Someone down the street.
You don't have to be intimately acquainted with a man to realize... he'd be receptive to the sort of opportunity we offer.
I'm sorry. Right now,
I just can't seem to —
What I mean is, I —
I'd like to think about it.
Well, that's all we ask.
As you can imagine... our business is acquired through present clients.
It's a word-of-mouth operation, Wilson.
You don't suppose we can advertise in magazines and newspapers.
[ Chuckles ]
No, of course not.
I think you'll come up with something.
- [ Man ] Hold it. Thank you.
- [ Clicks ]
Hold your arm up, please,
Mr. Wilson.
- Excuse me. I don't understand.
- That's it.
- Is all this really necessary?
- 13 1/2. Profile.
- Turn sideways.
- Wait a moment. Is this necessary for —
- Hold it. That's it.
- [ Camera Shutter Clicking ]
- Back view.
- What is this, preliminary for surgery?
Certainly, Mr. Wilson.
A year's gone by.
A lot happens to the human body.
This one is yours, sir.
Hello, Arthur.
- Excuse me. I don't believe I know you.
- It's me, buddy.
Fidelis eternis.
Charlie?
You're Charlie?
Guess I am, old buddy.
What are you doing here?
Same as yourself: waiting.
What's the matter?
Uh, nothing. I —
It's just that it's... hard to recognize somebody and... not recognize them at the same time.
How long have you been here?
Oh, a while.
When you phoned me, you were here?
- Mm-hmm.
- Even the first time?
But you sounded... like the whole thing was something tremendous... this... rebirth, everything, even when you hadn't made a go of it.
I thought you'd have a better chance.
Good God! How long does a man have to wait to get into surgery?
Not long, usually.
I had to stay around and telephone you, if necessary... through your first adjustment, but now —
That's what you meant about our being... tied together.
Mm.
I couldn't help it, Charlie.
I had to find out where I went wrong.
The years I've spent... trying to get all the things...
I was told were important... that I was supposed to want!
Things!
Not people... or meaning.
Just... things.
And California was the same.
They... made the same decisions for me all over again... and they were the same things, really.
It's gonna be different from now on.
A new face, a new name.
I'll do the rest.
I know it's gonna be different.
I suppose you do too.
[ Buzzer Sounds ]
Good morning, gentlemen.
Mr. Carlson, please.
Charlie. You?
- Art, I —
- Mr. Carlson, please.
Charlie...
I have the feeling you're gonna make it this time.
Sorry to disappoint the rest of you.
Perhaps tomorrow.
You don't seem to understand our problem, Mr. Wilson.
- I understand it perfectly.
- But you're not cooperating.
I've told you over and over again,
I cannot think of anyone.
- I can't believe that.
- I've been shuffled around long enough.
It's about time I had the opportunity to start living... some kind of meaningful existence.
If I did sponsor someone... wouldn't that delay my trip to surgery... in the event that I were needed from time to time... to, say, advise him?
No, that's not likely, not if the selection is a good one.
I'm sorry. I don't seem to be able to think of a single soul.
- You mean you deliberately won't.
- Have it your way.
Very well.
That'll be all, Mr. Wilson.
You can go back to the dayroom.
Processing, please.
This is Ruby.
On Wilson, 722...
I think we can go to the next stage now.
Hello, son.
Oh, sir, I —
Ah, you know, I sure hoped you'd make it, find your dream come true.
- What?
- I said, I sure hoped you'd make it... find your dream come true.
I guess I —
I guess I never had a dream.
Maybe that's it.
That — That sure might have been it.
If I did have one... it certainly wasn't...
Antiochus Wilson.
This time...
I've got to be allowed, sir, to make my own decision.
You know, son... when I began this business,
I was a young man with an idea.
I wasn't aiming to make a lot of money, helping others... helping them to find a little happiness.
Oh, heck, just not the rich.
I thought eventually —
You see, I got tremendous comfort in the thought that, in my small way...
I was waging a battle against human misery... and I was too.
Except we do have a high percentage of failures.
I guess that's to be expected... but it hurts me.
Some reborns make a go of it.
We're always working to find ways to improve the system.
Yeah, we make mistakes.
Fact is, when our clients first started coming back here...
I just wanted to chuck the whole thing, but I couldn't.
The organization was pretty big by then.
Uh-huh.
Board of directors, on a profit-sharing basis.
All those people.
You've no idea what a financial responsibility it turned into.
Tsk, tsk.
[ Chuckles ]
Heck, we make mistakes, but we admit 'em... and go forward.
I won't see it in my lifetime... but some of the younger execs like Ruby may.
Oh, you can call it wishful thinking, son... but life is built on wishes.
And you've got to just keep plugging away at 'em.
You can't give up... and you can't let the mistakes...
- jeopardize the dream.
- [ Door Opens ]
Well, here's your transportation.
- What?
- Surgery, sir.
- But I've got to talk to you.
- We're on a very tight schedule. Please.
Why, I — I didn't expect so soon that —
It's efficiency. You're lucky we got a match so quick.
Hop aboard, son.
Up there.
The doctors are waiting.
That's just so you won't fall off.
But there's things we have to talk about. I mean, my identity —
We will. We will later.
Mm-hmm.
Just relax, son.
Everything's gonna be fine. Just fine.
The thing about doing it on my own.
You see, it's so important: choice.
You've got to change.
We have to talk about it.
We will.
I'll look into it personally.
Just remember, son, we gotta keep plugging away at the dream.
The mistakes teach us how.
It wasn't wasted. Remember that.
My name is Dr. Morris, sir.
According to our records, you were reared in the Protestant faith.
Did you convert to any other during your adjustment?
No.
Good. Good.
That is, "good" in the sense that we have a certain definition.
Now, I am not suggesting that being a Protestant... is any better than being a Catholic or Jew.
As a matter of fact, I am qualified to care for you in either of those faiths as well.
I was ordained in each: rabbi, priest, and minister.
I admit it unusual.
Uh, maybe even a bit advanced.
Wait a minute.
What's happening?
Well, my good sir, when we have finished...
- you will go on to the next stage.
- I don't mean that!
Ultimately, Mr. Wilson, ultimately we'll be called... to face the Creator and render up our last account.
It happens to all of us, sir.
That's no answer! I want to know what's happening to me now!
Don't shout! Please!
No!

"Wilson, mesomorph, age 51... no current diseases.
Requisitioned from dayroom stock May 6.
Released for cadaver use last night.
CPS number 722.
Disposition: death by automobile accident... caused by cerebral hemorrhage."
- All right. Acid etch.
- Yes, sir.
- What's the solution strength?
- Five percent at ten cc's.
Timer.
Five minutes.
[ Faint Moaning ]
You were my best work,
Mr. Wilson.
I'm sorry it all has to end like this.
All right, set him up.
I think we'll put the hemorrhage right under the left exoccipital... in the lingual gyrus.
Put that light over here.
Good.
All right.
- [ Exhales ]
- Relax, old friend.
Cranial drill.
[ Drill Whirring ]
[ Whirring Continues ]
[ Whirring Fades ]
Hey, stop.
What are you doing?
Hey!
H- hot!
Not ready yet?
Be patient.
But I've got a TV rehearsal.
What a hustler.
Give me a hand!
- Hurry up!
- I know.
- Your bandage...
- Oh yeah.
Over there.
Pose.
It's summer by the sea... come on now.
Hurry!
This isn't a thriller!
- What is it?
- What's wrong?
Watch out!
ATRAGON
It's dangerous. Keep back.
Your stolen car?
Yes, I'm certain.
How did it get stolen?
I was waiting for Mr. Shindo at Towa Construction Company.
Suddenly, I was choked and passed out.
A kidnapper wouldn't jump into a cold sea...
Who are you?
I'm a reporter.
Will you explain again?
Again?
Until I'm satisfied.
You were taking PR pictures.
What time was it?
About 20 minutes past 12.
A man came out of the sea?
- Yes.
- Here, right here.
He appeared suddenly.
Seemed made out of vapor, didn't he?
Or steam.
Be serious, will you?
We are... as truthful as a camera.
Why would he let off steam?
I don't know. But it's true.
Officer...
The hands that choked me from behind were hot, like fire!
Officer.
What is it?
Nothing down there.
I didn't find any bodies.
There!
- Get on the ball! I found a model!
- A model?
Miss!
Very nice.
A nice model.
What?
It's Action Magazine.
They want the cover picture.
It's ready. So-so.
So-so? I like that.
- Mad? Find her then.
- Why?
For my model.
But 10 million people in Tokyo, about half are women... I can't find her.
Find this number.
Easy.
I've never played sleuth before.
"SO 72-95".
Did you steal something?
What?
Police officers are here.
More questions?
An engineer was kidnapped at a dam site.
He's the second man since last night.
Vapor man again?
Gave off steam like a geyser.
Geyser man?
So you believe us now?
No! We have no evidence at all...
Only one thing to go on.
Those two who were kidnapped are civil engineers and experts on cave-ins.
Was it a coincidence?
By the way...
Earthquake!
The Vapor man!
A man to see you, sir.
U. Unno, True Story Magazine reporter?
His business?
He said he would like to ask you about the Imperial Navy enigma.
Enigma?
Tell him I have nothing to do with it.
You don't?
I see. You are a shipping company president now.
But you're the former Admiral Kusumi of the Japanese Navy.
Am I wrong?
I have no sensational war stories.
You've got one secret?
I feel chilled... excuse me.
About your secret.
A special submarine which never appeared to the public...
A weekly wrote it up...
A-400, the largest submarine.
Old news.
Yes, that's right.
A-400, 401, and 402 were disposed of after the surrender.
That's right.
But there was another submarine sailed on the night the war ended...
...A- 403.
403? Not even interesting as fiction.
The captain was Commander Jinguji...
He was your right-hand man, best sub man...
Where did he go?
You know what his special mission was.
Don't be silly!
He died before the surrender off the coast of Saipan.
A fine man.
He is alive.
What?
That's what reports say.
Hello, it's me.
You found her?
I'm better than a cop.
What now?
What? Get her consent?
Maker her pose nude?
Fool!
I didn't say nude!
It's utterly idiotic!
Groundless entertainment is stupid.
Did my father really die?
Makoto, what are you implying?
I'm sorry.
Your father was a fine Navy officer and unequaled in shipbuilding techniques.
The night before he left for an attack, he came to me and...
...asked me to look after you.
You were 3 at the time.
Did he really have to leave his only child and go?
That's war.
Country comes before personal feelings.
Country?
Yes, patriotism.
Patriotism?
Young people now may not understand it.
It's here.
Kokoku Shipping.
That car!
Come on.
- Should we go to her house?
- That's my boy.
Never let the prey get away? I know.
What's wrong?
Forget that phony reporter's words.
It's not that. Lately a strange man has been following me.
He's watching me when I go out or when I'm near my apartment.
I'm frightened.
Perhaps it's best to notify the police.
If anything happens to you,
I won't be able to face Jinguji.
Where are we? This is a wrong road.
Please be quiet, Admiral.
What? Who are you?
Something's wrong.
They're headed straight for the sea!
Admiral, please get out.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to obey my orders.
Over there!
Hold it!
What's this?
- Violence is not good!
- What are you going to do with them?
I will have them pledge loyalty to the Mu Empire.
The Mu Empire?
I'm Mu Agent No. 23.
You're mad!
It's a mythical Empire which sank into the Pacific Ocean...
...thousands of years ago!
You're well informed.
It's nonsense!
Well, you'll see.
Are you crazy?
Let go!
We have special energy. It's useless.
Be quiet!
Hot!
You two will work for us as slaves.
Slaves?
Uncle!
Our Agents.
- A submarine will come for us soon.
- A submarine?
Admiral, even if you kill me, other agents will come to get you.
Come with me and I won't shoot.
No, we'll meet again.
METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPT.
So, you are the one who fired?
Yes.
He escaped into the sea?
The point is they're sent all over the world.
What agent?
A Mu agent.
The Mu Empire? Is it in Africa?
Think so?
No, it sank into the Pacific Ocean
12,000 years ago.
Sir, this.
This is for you, Mr. Kusumi.
For me?
Admiral Kusumi c/o Police Chief Ito.
From Mu Empire Agent No. 23.
It may be an explosive. I'll open it.
- A time bomb?
- Please.
It seems like a film.
The Pacific Ocean...
12,000 years ago, the glorious Mu
Empire existed in the Pacific Ocean.
The whole world was Mu Empire's colony.
You will be shown proof.
Cursed by fate, she sank to the bottom of the sea in one night.
But our ancestors survived.
The Mu people far surpass the people who live on earth.
With terrestrial heat we made a sun.
We live at the bottom of the sea by using buried resources.
Mr. Kusumi, the A-403!
Why is the A-403 there?
The Japanese Navy's pride... it is the best and largest submarine.
Commanded by Capt. Jinguji.
We regret he and his crew were not on it when we took it.
Admiral Kusumi...
Our reports say Capt. Jinguji is building a more powerful...
...and efficient submarine.
Atragon could be called an undersea battleship.
As you know, Admiral.
Now, in conclusion...
Stop the construction of Atragon immediately.
And return the world to the Mu Empire, so we can inhabit the earth again.
Listen to our people's joyous voices!
If you refuse...
...our curse and Manda's, our deity's messenger, will be on you.
Are we sane?
I think so.
So the world was the Mu Empire's colony?
It's a stupid joke.
Ajoke?
Wasn't that the real A-403?
It could be an imitation.
What do you think?
So it's a blackmail case, isn't it?
The police can't cope with it.
The perps are too big.
FILMS THREATEN NATIONS
EMERGENCYMEETING AT U.N.
The U.N. met about the Mu film.
Most of the delegates were skeptical.
It took only 10 minutes to decide to ignore them.
End of special news.
Captain, something ahead!
Captain, starboard...
Stop the engine!
Captain! Captain!
Full speed astern!
SOS, SOS...
MU DECLARATION SHOCKS WORLD
VENICE DESTROYED
HONG KONG IN RUINS
The U.N. sets up a United Defense HQ to cope with the emergency.
Trouble in "B" Block Area, long.
140°31 'E, lat. 9°20'N.
Immediately, orders are sent to the Red Satan...
...the world's newest atomic submarine which is operating in the area.
The Red Satan was crushed by water pressure.
It was the world's best submarine.
I'm afraid there's nothing we can do.
Of course, we could use the H-bomb.
But I doubt its power in high pressure water.
And its use is limited due to moral principles...
Atragon comes to mind.
We have no idea of its efficiency.
But the Mu Empire has noticed it.
It must have something that they are scared of.
Please contact Captain Jinguji at once.
Contact?
I don't know where he is.
But the film said you know where he is.
I don't know!
Then why did you remain silent when Captain Jinguji left?
Mr. Kusumi.
The U.N. requests that the Atragon be used.
Very well.
I was silent for the Captain's sake, but I will tell you.
The Captain revolted.
Revolted?
That's all.
Yes?
- Police Dept. is on the phone.
- Police Dept.?
Hello. Kusumi speaking.
What? You caught a Mu man?
Sir.
Thank you for coming.
Is he the man who shadowed you?
Yes, he is.
But he is not Agent No. 23 who tried to kidnap us.
No, he was a spare man.
Any evidence?
We've been questioning him, but his only answer is a number... 8561.
8561? The number's too big.
Fool!
I'm not a Mu, I'm a Japanese!
Why did you follow her?
You are trying to kidnap her, so you can find out where Captain Jinguji is.
No!
- Then why?
- Be quiet!
Wait!
It's probably the
Japanese Navy tag number...
Soldiers called them reservation numbers to Yasukuni Shrine.
I'm former Rear Admiral Kusumi.
Your name?
Warrant Officer Amano, sir!
You know me?
Yes, Captain Jinguji told me.
What?
He's alive?
Um...
Is he?
Yes, sir!
Where is he?
- I can't say, sir!
- What!
That's his orders, sir.
Admiral, this earthquake isn't a coincidence.
Remember me? I'm Mu Agent No. 23.
Where is the broadcasting room?
The world must obey the Mu Empire now...
...and become our colony.
Order Captain Jinguji to stop building Atragon.
If you refuse, we will annihilate you!
Officer Amano, where is the Captain?
That's a secret.
Please let me see my father.
It will be against his orders.
I'm a True Story reporter.
Even a dog, if it's alert, notices something.
Officer Amano.
As it is, the world will be destroyed.
Your superior, Captain Jinguji's daughter, too.
You want her to die?
Quiet!
Officer, I know you're loyal to the Captain.
I'll explain to him later, so tell me.
I see.
I can't tell you where he is, but I'll take you, sir.
Mr. Amano, it's all right now, isn't it?
What?
The Atragon base.
Which island is it?
- Navy secret.
- Navy?
Japan renounced war in her constitution.
You'll see.
Why did you bring him?
He would write it up if we didn't.
With us, the secret is safe.
Hierarch, Agent No. 23 has returned.
Will we know soon where
Captain Jinguji's base is?
Yes, a contact party of Kusumi has left.
Good.
It will please our Majesty.
Just wait and see.
We'll find out where it is.
Keep an eye on them.
Yes, sir.
What happened?
Cave-in! Power Room 57!
What?
The Japanese slaves just finished checking!
- Send them again!
- Yes, sir.
Hurry up!
Oh, Mu God!
We are trying to build a glorious Mu Empire on earth again!
Oh, Mu God!
Please transfer our hardships to the slaves on earth!
- Don't salute. This isn't the Navy.
- Yes, sir.
We left the plane 3 days ago.
How much longer will it take?
- We will arrive at midnight.
- Midnight?
- What's the name of the island?
- You'll see, sir.
A stubborn fellow.
What is it? Depressed?
It's nothing.
I'm worried.
What would my father think if he knew I came?
Oh, that...
Of course he would give you a big welcome.
You think so?
Are you bitter towards him?
No, I'm not.
But I don't understand him.
A father loves his child.
He was worried about you. That's why he sent the Warrant Officer secretly.
Then why didn't he say so?
It's an old-fashioned patriotism.
People thought it effeminate to think of home.
Please go in.
We can't afford to be caught.
Hey!
Please get ready to land! Hurry!
There?
Yes.
My hunch was wrong! I thought it would be an uninhabited island.
It's big!
All right, get off now.
Who is it?
It's... it's me!
What?
It's me.
Oh, Amano, all right.
Please.
Please get in.
It's stuck!
Here.
Everyone, please get out and push!
Are you ready?
Huh? Where is the True Story's reporter?
There he is.
How can you?
Look at that. It's amazing!
Iron pyrites, bauxite, manganese.
Untapped resources!
GOTEN KENBU CORPS
Amano is back!
This is Admiral Kusumi.
I am Lieutenant Fuji.
I'm Kusumi.
This is Miss Jinguji.
Please relax. The Captain?
I'll contact him, sir!
Amano, ask them to rest.
Mr. Kusumi, isn't it strange?
Whats strange?
There are no docks or factory.
Underground.
Hear it?
Faint machine noises.
Thank you for waiting.
Commander is here.
Jinguji!
It's been some time, sir!
I didn't know you were alive.
I thank you for treating my revolt quietly.
It's over and done with.
Captain...
This is Makoto.
Surprised? She's become beautiful.
Thank you!
Please relax.
It's an amazing place. Any natives?
Only those helping us.
It's ideal for our base.
The Atragon?
Atragon?
I see.
I'm wrong?
We are testing Goten-go tomorrow.
Goten-go?
That's Atragon.
Please rejoice.
We can serve the Navy again.
Do you have any idea why I came?
Amano told me.
That makes it simpler.
The world urgently needs Atragon.
The world is waiting.
I refuse.
What?
Goten-go is for Japan when she's active again.
She's for Japan...
Think it over.
The war ended 20 years ago.
Our Corps hasn't surrendered yet!
Wait!
Not even a kind word for your daughter! War crazy!
War crazy?
Excuse me!
Who is that man?
I guarantee that he won't make Makoto unhappy.
The Captain hasn't been around.
Is he angry?
No, he was always stubborn.
We're not welcome?
But we can't go back.
- I'll show you the dock, sir.
- Where is the Captain?
He has been up all night preparing for the test.
Who is it?
I'm sorry. I got lost when I was taking a walk.
Don't wander around!
I'm sorry.
All clear!
This is the entrance to the dock. Please.
Prepare for takeoff.
Bow, ready for takeoff.
Mid-section, ready for takeoff.
Engine room, ready for takeoff.
Stern, ready for takeoff.
Admiral, I've been waiting for you.
This is Goten-go or Atragon.
Lt. Fuji.
Yes, sir. Standing by.
We will start a test operation now.
In position!
In position!
- Open gate No. 1.
- Open gate No. 1.
Open gate No. 1.
Standing by!
Start!
Start!
Start flooding!
Water level 10 feet.
Fifteen.
Twenty.
Waterway filled.
- Open gate No. 2.
- Open gate No. 2.
- Slow speed ahead.
- Slow speed ahead.
Surfacing!
Hold your horses! A fish leaped.
I knew it wasn't enough noise for a ship.
Look!
Congratulations!
Wonderful performance.
We'll test the Cold Air Cannon tomorrow.
The Cold Air Cannon?
It is an instant freeze cannon.
It's absolute zero... 460°F below zero.
One thing puzzles me.
Yes?
Why does the Mu have the A-403?
And how do they know about Atragon?
It's simple.
When we were seeking for a place for our base...
...an unidentified submarine attacked us.
All of the plan would fail if we died.
So we used A-403 as a decoy to escape.
When they captured it, it was empty.
The blue print of Atragon was left behind.
Of course they didn't have the details but they marked us.
I see.
Please, Admiral.
Drop the Admiral... touching an old scar.
An old scar?
Our new Constitution has renounced war.
Who made us?
What?
You've changed.
My plans seemed like a revolt, yet you said you'd be responsible.
Your former guts?
The 20 years after the war gave us time to think.
Are you saying that Atragon is useless?
Who said so?
We need it... that's why we're here.
Atragon is not useless, the world needs it.
I refuse!
You still don't understand?
I refuse!
I built Atragon for our Navy!
All has changed!
I'll change it again with Atragon!
Fool! Stop talking nonsense!
Nonsense?
You call patriotism nonsense?
Take a global point of view!
I'll devote my life to my country!
Makoto.
Makoto...
Why are you crying?
Do you hate me?
I shouldn't have come.
I was happier dreaming about you.
Please, Father...
Please, do as Mr. Kusumi says.
Makoto...
For 20 years I left you in other hands and spent my time to rebuild Japan.
Don't you understand?
But you don't know how I feel.
Do you understand how a child feels, orphaned by war?
Yes, I do!
No, you don't.
If you did, you would work for world good.
Your way of thinking is like the people of Mu.
I hate you for it.
Makoto.
I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!
It's you.
You called me war crazy.
Yes, I did.
And one more thing.
More?
- A war crazy has got a deadly weapon.
- What!
You are a ghost wearing rusty armor named patriotism.
A ghost?
I feel sorry for Makoto.
Excuse me.
Wait!
I've kept this close to me for 20 years.
Take care of her.
What are you doing?
I'll take you to the Mu Empire.
Let me go! Let me go!
Damn.
What are you up to, anyway?
Let go! I'm being kind!
Kind? Stop your joking!
You'll all blow up! I've set a bomb!
What are you saying?
Emergency! Emergency!
Hurry!
Commander, a bomb was set on the dock!
- What? Who did it?
- The reporter, sir.
Halt!
Your Majesty, they are the prisoners from our enemy, Atragon.
What shall we do?
Sacrifice them to Manda.
To Manda?
Manda will be delighted, I'm sure.
Manda!
Manda! Manda!
If Captain Jinguji doesn't listen to us, you will be sacrificed to Manda.
Manda?
Open that window.
Well?
An iron pillar is on top of the hatch.
- Remove it! Hurry!
- Yes, sir.
- Cut it!
- Yes, sir.
Mr. Kusumi, a Mu troop has appeared on Mt. Mihara!
From the crater, the radio said.
- What're police doing?
- Catch them!
Not as easy as thieves!
You take them!
We're the reconnaissance unit.
Have all climbers come down?
No, there are quite a few left.
Move forward!
What are those?
- They are flying saucers!
- No, they're not!
What are they?
Susumu, are you all right?
Thank you.
Mr. Shindo, is there any way to escape?
Even if there were, it's the bottom of the sea.
So there is no use in stealing these then.
Wait! What do you think they are?
Dynamite?
Special ones.
They have been using gigantic rocks since antiquity.
It's called megalithic culture.
They are the powerful dynamite used on those rocks.
I can't believe you stole them and you are still alive.
It's terrible!
I think they will start attacking soon.
Manda!
Manda! Manda!
We warn you in the name of Mu.
People of the colonies!
Destroy the Atragon!
Return our colonies immediately!
It's the only way to save yourselves from ruin!
Note February 10, 2400 hrs.
At first, the New York skyscrapers...
...and downtown Tokyo, you will see our power there.
You will see what we just said is no idle threat!
Not yet?
It's very hard, isn't it?
All right! Let's go down.
Check all parts!
Bow, all in order!
Mid-section too!
Engine room too!
Stern too!
Stand by!
All right.
But we're sealed in though.
You'll soon see.
- Stand by to start.
- Stand by to start.
- Start!
- Start!
Shall we go?
Go where?
I think I was wearing rusty armor.
I took it off and feel fine.
Jinguji!
Please contact HQ.
Atragon will now sail to destroy the Mu Empire!
- All's quiet, sir.
- Good.
- We still have five minutes left. Be alert.
- Yes, sir.
HQ! Come in!
Roger!
Three Allied Army planes!
This is the fate of those who defy the Mu Empire.
Atragon!
Defying our warnings, Jinguji?
Report it to our Empress!
They're escaping.
We'll follow to find their base!
- Touch down!
- Touch down!
- Open the vent.
- Open the vent.
- Depth 500.
- Depth 500.
Come out!
Become sacrifices to Manda!
Don't move! See this?
Understand? Move, and the Mu Empire will blow up!
Open it!
Wear these water-tight suits.
What is that noise?
I don't know!
You, too, Your Majesty.
What? I refuse to go!
Taking you up to land.
No!
I'm letting in sea water.
Wait!
That's the entrance to the Mu Empire.
- Stop!
- Stop!
A monster!
- Open the hatch!
- Open the hatch!
Your father.
Father!
Makoto.
Uncle.
Fine. Fine.
The Mu Empress.
Jinguji, it's useless to defy us.
Do you think you can win?
You defy us!
Mu Empire will win!
We will rule the world.
Killing me cannot kill our Empire's heart!
Empire's heart?
It's the power room using terrestrial heat for Mu energy.
Where is it?
It's located at six miles below the
Palace.
That's right.
Give up and surrender!
We will attack as long as you tell us to surrender!
But we'll listen to peace talks.
Impertinent!
Then we'll attack the heart of the Mu Empire.
- Stand by and dive!
- Stand by and dive!
Dive!
Emergency light! Hurry!
High tension current!
- Cold Air Cannon! Stand by!
- Cold Air Cannon! Stand by!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Advance unit assemble! Hurry!
Salute.
The advance unit will leave, sir!
Start!
What? Atragon is in the power room?
Yes!
Fool! It can't be!
They're inferior to us! They can't enter the power room from outside!
Absolutely not!
- Make sure to set the right time.
- Yes.
We did it!
Stand by to attack!
Stand by to attack!
Fire!
Fire!
Hey!
Let her go.
She knows she'll die yet she's returning. Just let her go.
Susumi!

How do you know? l haven't fought him yet.,,
- l am The Phantom Killer.
- What? You're the Phantom Killer?,,
Of course.
But you won't beat my master.,,

He'll beat you good.,
Wow, he sounds very tough.

You're him!,
Abbot, master.
That his name be praised and may he bless you.,,, l've been in retirement for years. l want no trouble.,,, lt wasn't my intention to fight.,,,
But when l heard you defeated my students,,, l thought l'd give you the benefit of my experience.,,, l'd like to give you some advice.,,,
Sir, must you and your students always talk so much?,,
They have followed my teachings.,,,
Let's stop talking and start fighting.,,, l fear, my boy, that if we fight, you may get hurt or even die.
What do you have in mind, then?,,
We take three blows each, alternately,, until one of us gives up.,,,

Sorry, if that was too painful, l'll stop.,
You don't have to continue.,,

Master!,,

That's right, l am.
Accept me as your student.,
Damn fool!,, l swore an oath on my ancestor's grave, if anyone could beat me, he would be my master.,,
- You should help me keep my promise.

You defeated me, you shouldn't break a promise to the dead.,
Stop bothering me, or you'll get a good hiding.,
Hey! You must teach me everything, l need to know more styles, master.
- ls that right?
- l'm afraid so.,,
Master!,,
Master!, l'll follow you!,
Master!,
Chun Yao!,

Who was that?,
Some nut begging me to be his master.,
He knows you're a kung fu expert?,
Yeah, l helped this blind guy in town and he was watching me.
We have enough problems already. You know it isn't wise to cause trouble., l'm well aware of that.
Hey, you start cooking.
- Mistress...
- Chun Yao!,
What are you doing here?, l'm a good cook.
Take me as your student, master.
Rubbish! Take you as my student just because you're a good cook!,
Then l'd have to take in every cook in town!,
You shouldn't compare me with them.,
Get out! Beat it!,
- He's still there.
- Forget him, he'll be gone soon.
Thanks.,
Boy.,
Hey, boy!
Boy!,
Good morning, Mistress.
Why didn't you eat the food?,

Maybe he already left.,
Goddamn you! Move aside!
Bring Chun Yao out here!,,
- Can you see Chun Yao?
- No, sir.,
Are you sure?,,
Now get out of here!,,
Let's go.,,
They can't even fight. l wonder why master is afraid of them.,,,
You'd better rest.,,,
Maybe his kung fu isn't all that good. l think l'll test him again.,,,
There's no doubt, he's the best.,,
Master...,,,
He might hit me again.,,,
Damn it!,,,
Master, you're kung fu's very good, so why are you afraid of them?,
Shut up and mind your own business.,,,
Master, Confucius said, when in doubt ask, so don't be so hard on me.
Well, did you kill anyone?,,
Of course not, l just hurt them a bit.,,
Master, why are you running from those guys?,,
You seem to know them, it doesn't make sense.,,
How dare you, you impudent fool!,,
Master...,,,
How do you know they're my relations?,, l was only guessing.,,
Chun Yao!,,
Leave him!,,
Chun, you'd better stay at my uncle's, they won't look there.
Let's go.,,
Fine, you go! But l'll follow.,
Have a seat.,,
Uncle.,,
Sit down.,,
Uncle, please don't tell anyone
Chun's here.,
Don't worry, l won't., l'm sorry to bring this on you.,,
That's all right. l'll get you some clean linen.,,
Make yourselves at home.,,
Here, Yoo Yi, have some tea.
Chun Yao, we can't run forever, they're bound to find us.
You have to be realistic.,,
This will never end unless you see big brother and l'm tired of running.,, lt's easier said than done, please try to be patient.,
Look, any problem can be solved if you try.,
Unless...,, l can't do it.,,
All right, l know.,
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.,,
- l'll see you to the door.
- Goodbye.,,
Sorry about all this, Uncle.,
That's all right. What are relatives for? You'd do the same for me.,,
Mistress, l'll do whatever master doesn't want to do., l'm sure we can solve any problem.,,
You don't understand.,,
Explain it to me. l can't help unless l know the facts.,,
As a loyal student l should help. l'll do everything in my power.,,
But you're not his student.
He never accepted you.,,
Who cares! l made myself his student.,, lt's a very long story. l understand how Chun Yao feels.,,
Then tell me, so l can understand.
Please, mistress. lt's so complicated!
Where do l begin?,,
Just take your time and tell me from the beginning.,, lt was on the night of our wedding.,,
Happiness,,
Congratulations!
You lucky guy, she's beautiful.,
Let's drink to the bride.,,
Hey, get off me!,
- Let's see the guests out.
- Right.,,
Here's to the happy couple!
Long life and happiness!,,
- Goodbye, thank you.
- Goodbye.,
Watch your step.,,
Thank you. Thank you...,,
Hey! Don't go yet.
The party's just beginning.,, lt's a great day. What's more, you're father of the bride.,
Get out of here!,,
And lots of happiness, too.,
Stop this, enough! He's just drunk.,
Has anyone seen big brother?,,
Why have you blown out the candles?
That's bad luck.,,
Big brother! lt's you!,,
- Let me go!
- Stop yelling, woman.,
Whatever belongs to Chun Yao belongs to me.,, lf my father hadn't taken him off the street,, the bastard would have starved to death.,,
He's just an orphan. l'm the one you should have married.,,
What are all of you doing here?
Get out!,,
Get out, the lot of you!
Go on, get out!
Go on, out you get. Go on. l'll go, too.
You better leave., l told my sister to marry you. But the fool said she didn't love you...,
Hold it!,
Where are you going?,
There's no point in our staying here.,
Just you listen. Who took you into this house? Who cared for you?,
Who was it that blinded me?,
Think about that, you ungrateful swine.
All right, you can go.
But Yoo Yi stays with me.
No way!,
Then l'll make up your mind for you.
Men! Don't let her leave the house.,
Don't just stand there! Get her!,
Don't hurt my sister!,
Are you OK?,
Hey, don't throw her around like that!,
How dare you! l'll show you!,,
You dare beat me!,,
Why don't you fight back?,,
Kill him! l want her alive. Go!,,
On my back!,,
Brother, take her and go.
Run for it! We'll hold him back.,
Get out of here, all of you, l'll handle him.
Out of the way!,,
Get out of my way, you bastard!,
They were playing one day when Chun Yao blinded him.,,
He's lucky he's only blind in one eye.,, l'll poke his other one out for him.,,
What's this about an eye?,,
Are you crazy, telling this stranger about our affairs?,
Master, why not teach me so l can take revenge for you?,
- Revenge for what?
- On your wedding night, remember?,
That bastard with your wife!
You must really hate him.,, l've never hated anyone!,,
Never in my life have l seen a bigger coward than you!,,
You chicken shit!
Go on, admit it, you're scared!
Wake up and smell the roses, you stupid bastard!,
You can't hide forever!
You think you're a hero.,,
So why aren't you fighting back, you coward!,
You're a coward and a fool!,,
You stupid fool!,,
You're lucky this time. lf l catch you, l'll kill you!,
That won't do you any good. lt won't help you get your revenge.,,
Stay away from us, or l will kill you!,
- What's taking you so long?
- Don't worry, l'm working on it.,
Who are you?,, l am a killer.,,
A killer?, l work in secret. No-one ever knows who l'm going to kill next.,
- So who are you going to kill today?
- Liu Chun Yao.,
Liu Chun Yao.,
- And who are you?
- l am..., l am the killer of killers, if you know what l mean?
Ah! You're going to kill me!,
You're doing it all wrong.,
Well, l've never killed myself before.
Don't worry, master. This man wanted to kill you. But l took care of him.
How dare you come in here!,
Well, l wouldn't have dared except l know you're a kind man and you'll forgive me.,
Mistress., l'll count to three, then you'd better be gone. lf l don't have your forgiveness... l'd rather die.,
- One...
- Chun Yao!,,,
- Two!
- Have some tea first, master.,,
- Three!
- Mistress...,,,
- No, darling!
- Out of my way!,,
Master!,,, l'm not your master!,,,
Mistress, master...,,
- Stop it, Chun Yao!
- Stay out of this!,,
Chun Yao!,,,
Master, stop this. Stop now, l'm warning you, or l'll fight back.
Fight back then.,,, l'll get you for that!,,,
Watch it!,,,
Excuse me!,,, lf you want to fight, go outside.,,
All right.
Master, you heard what the lady said.,,
- You?
- Me, you see? l'm good.,
Let's get out of here. Mistress.,,
Master! Come on, l'm over here.,
Brother Chun, take it easy or you'll kill him.,
Stop a minute. There's a rumour that master's very sick, he may die soon.,
Really?,, lt might be a trap.,,
You're right, but it doesn't matter, l have to go.
- May l come?
- lt's none of your business!,,
What do you mean?,, lf he's your master, then he's my grandmaster, and we've never met!
This could be our last chance.,,
Master, forgive me, l'm late.
Come here, boy.,
Where do you live?
Where are your parents?,, l don't have any.,,
Go away and leave him alone.,,
Oh, poor boy.,
Chun...Yao...,, l spoilt Chong Ming.,,
But he was my only son.,,
Promise me...that you'll protect him and guide him.,,
Dad.,,
My son...,,
Dad!,,
Master.,,
Master.,,
Mistress, it's an ambush. They're waiting outside. You must leave now!,
- Get going!
- Come on!,,
Chun Yao! Chun Yao, let's go!,
Well, Liu Chun Yao, you can't escape this time.
Chen Rong, please take care of my wife for me.,
Yeah, of course.,
All right, men, kill him!
- Who are you?
- Her brother.,, lt makes no difference to me!,, l give up!,, l'll show him.,,
No, don't, please!
This is the blunt side.,,
That's enough!
This time l really give up.,, l didn't mean it.,,
Don't be scared, mistress.,
- Master!
- l'm not your master!,,
- That wound's pretty bad!
- Go away!,, l asked you to look after my wife. Go!,,
- Chun Yao!
- Mistress!,,
Stay back!,,
Chun Yao!,,
Chun Yao!,,
- Who told you to fight?
- lt was my own decision.,,
Mr Ming, stop the fight and call them off., l will stay with you.,,
Stop!,,
Chun Yao, ever since l've known you, we've been on the run.
Now here we are, back where we began.,
You won't face facts.
You're a coward.,,
This must be settled once and for all.,,
Following you...running all my life, l can't take any more!, l want a home where l can settle down.,, l'm going to stay with Chong Ming.,, lt's best we part.,,
Yoo Yi, you don't love me?,
Get out of my life! l never want to see you again.,,
Please don't look at me that way.
There is nothing between us any more.,, l never thought you'd abandon me.,, l didn't realise you were such a coward.,,
Right, l see now, l'll go.
Let him go.,,
Chun Yao!,,
- Master.
- Beat it!,, l can't believe she means it.,,
Don't be sad. As soon as the funeral is over, we'll get married.,
- You! Show Yoo Yi to her room.
- Yes, sir.,
This way.,,
Master!,,
Yoo Yi! Yoo Yi!,,
Yoo Yi! Why did you do this?,,
One last wish...
Please, leave Chun Yao alone.,
Yoo Yi...!,,
Yoo Yi!,,
Hey, you!,
What are you doing up there?,,
Well, ah... l've been repairing the roof. lt's fixed now.,
What do you want?,,
All right! That's enough!,,
Master, are you satisfied with my kung fu?,
Master Tong, if you weren't good, l wouldn't have sent for you.
Hey, you, get some men together.
Take Yoo Yi's corpse and bury it in the forest.,,
This way.,, ln the forest?,,
Hey! Hurry up!,,
Hold on.,,
What's the matter?,,
This place gives me the creeps. lt's full of ghosts.,,
Don't be stupid! There's no such thing! Not in this world.,
Maybe not, but what about the other world?
There's nothing to worry about. We may as well protect ourselves though., l'll keep this for myself, and here you take this.
Here, this will protect you.
Now don't be scared.
Let's go.,
My God, it can't be! l don't believe it!
What's the matter?,
- l need a pee. l won't be long.
- There's always something. Be quick!,
We need a pee, too.
We'll be back soon.
Don't worry, we'll be right back.
What's going on? They've all disappeared, l'm alone here.
This place sure is creepy.
Lucky l've got this.,
No, it can't be...
No!, l hope this damn thing works!, lt does work!,
What happened to your teeth?,
Damn things wouldn't stay in.
Cheap rubbish!,
- You're not Dracula!
- You don't think so? Try this!,
Yoo Yi, why did you have to kill yourself?
Poor mistress is dead and master doesn't want me here, maybe l should go.,
Master, l'm leaving.
Master, l'm leaving. l said, l'm leaving!
- Chen Rong.
- Yes.,
Why did you call me?,
- Where will you go?
- l don't know., l'll try and find a master somewhere.,
- Really want me to teach you?
- You bet!,
Why else do you think l let you hit me around?,
So you'd teach me.,,
Why do you want to learn kung fu?
Revenge?,,
What revenge?
No way, l don't hate anyone., l want to learn because l'm interested,, it's healthy, a good hobby, l like it... l'm interested, that's all.,
First l'll teach you the lron Cross technique.,,
You need to combine both strength and speed.,,
And it involves both the feet and the fists.,,
Once you master this style, you can use it for both attack and defence.,
Attack and defence, l see. Continue.,
Hey! Don't just sit there!
Get up and practise.,,
Right!,,
- lt's taking you far too long.
- When the moment comes, l'll do it., l want Chun Yao dead by tomorrow at the latest.,,
Tomorrow?,,
Your kung fu has improved a lot.
But you're not powerful enough.,
You must practise hard, like a circus horse. Learn stamina!
Why so hard?,
- Ready?
- Yeah.,
Master, there's someone in the bushes.
They probably want to kill you., l'll handle it.,
Leave it to me.,
You...!, l'm sorry, master.
But l'm also the victim.
- Good work.
- Well, the job's done.
- Release her.
- l'll keep my word.,
Mother!,
- Mother!
- Chen Rong.,
You carried out the contract. ln return you get the gold and her.,
Take them and get out of here.,
That's right, l killed Liu Chun Yao for you.,,
But l feel bad about it.,,, lt's a bit late for that.
You murdered him, he's dead.,,
Maybe, maybe not. Sometimes dead men just won't lie still.,,
What do you mean by that?,,,
Take it easy.,,,
This is a family affair. l want no part of it.,,,
Whatever your problems are, they're between you and your brother.,,
- You...
- Hold on.,,,
You kidnapped my mother so l'd kill Liu Chun Yao.,,, l'd no qualms whatsoever in double-crossing a swine like you.,,,
The day he said he'd be my kung fu master, l told him everything,, how you hired me to kill him.,,,
Your move.,,,
Chun Yao, don't be a coward, kill him. Mother, let's go!
Chen Rong.,,,
Chen Rong! Chen Rong!,,
Mother! Mother!,,
Mother...!,,
Chong Ming, you son of a bitch!,
Chun Yao, don't be a coward.
Face up to him. Kill him.,
Chen Rong!,,
Never have l seen a bigger coward than you. You chicken!,,
Own up, you're too scared.
You'd better face reality.,
Wake up, you stupid bastard!
Come on, fight!
Stop hiding! Face them!,,
You coward!,,
Hold it!,, l'll take care of him.,,
And who are you?,,
Does it matter?
You're no friend of mine.,,
What does it matter if you know my name?,,
Listen, l'm warning you, you'd better stay out of this.
Otherwise, you'll all die!, l warned you, don't push me too far!, ls it really fair to kill the bastard?,,
Here lies my friend, Chen Rong,
Chen Rong!,,
Sometimes, reality is too complex for oral communication
But legend embodies it in a form which enables it to spread all over the world
It was 24.17, Oceanic Time when I approached the suburbs of Alphaville
Silence. Logic.
Security. Prudence
My paper reserved a room for me:
-You are?
-lvan Johnson
-Which paper?
-Figaro-Pravda
Room 344. Have you registered at Residents Control?
You must, even if you're a Festival visitor
Your bag, sir
-Please, sir.
-Nothing. Get lost
This way, sir
You're tired, sir?
You wish to sleep, sir?
It's this way, sir
If you're tired, you can rest, sir
Here it is, sir
The bedroom's here, sir
-What are you looking for now?
-I'm checking if the Bible's here
-Everyone has one.
-Do you believe that?
Yes, of course
I'll leave you the tranquillizers in the bathroom
I'm very well.
Thank you so very much
-Are you going to take a bath, sir?
-Yes, I must reflect
I'll help you, sir
And your tie, sir
-Now what? -I'll take a bath with you, sir, if you like
Listen, doll, I'm a big boy
I can find dames all alone
Now get lost
Be polite to the ladies,
Mr. Johnson
Shit. Now what?
This kid doesn't please you?
And your sister, sir?
-I'm getting out of shape.
-What sir?
What's going on here?
Are you on drugs or what?
No, it's normal, sir
All things weird are normal in this whore of cities
Sit in that chair
Her name was Beatrice
She said she was a seductress, third class
I was struck by the sadness and durability of her face
Something's not in orbit in the capital of this Galaxy
Hold this up
Not bad for a veteran of Guadalcanal
Just what I was thinking about you
Go play your games with someone else
I've heard it before
Y es? Mr. Johnson
Miss Natasha Vonbraun calls for you
Just a moment, please
Leonard Von Braun, inventor of the death ray bring back alive, or liquidate
Tell her to wait,
I'll be down in 5 minutes
She's on her way up
Henry Dickson, Agent X21,
12, Enrico Fermi, Alphaville
Got a light?
I've traveled 9,000 kilometers to give it to you
-I'm Natasha Vonbraun.
-Yes, I know
How do you know?
You are Miss Vonbraun
Yes, I'm very well, thank you so very much
You come from the Outlands,
Mr. Johnson?
-Everything to your satisfaction?
-Yes
I've been ordered to stay during your stay in Alphaville
Who ordered you?
The authorities, of course
You came for the festival,
Mr. Johnson?
Which festival?
The big one; that's why people from the Outlands come
-ln my opinion, it's silly you did not. -Why?
The festival's nearly over;
No more until next year
You don't say
Y es, Mr Johnson
But this evening, there's a gala reception
Very big
At a ministry. I'm going; come if you like
O.K.
What time? I must attend to something else first
You must go to
Residents Control registration?
No. What's that?
You mustn't forget to go there,
Mr Johnson. We can meet afterwards
No, I'll go there tomorrow.
First I must meet a friend
Me too, I've work to do
I'll give you the address where I'll be
Call for me and we'll go together
O.K. In an hour or two
All right, see you later,
Mr. Johnson
I'll go down with you, miss
Mr. Johnson, what's it like in the Outlands?
You've never been?
No, but my father told me about them when I was little
Now it's forbidden to think about them
Are you often ordered to stay with strangers?
-Yes, it's my job.
-Sometimes, it must be nice
-Why?
-You never have love affairs?
-What? -Has no one ever fallen in love with you?
In love? What's that?
There's one thing I'd like to know, miss
-Yes, Mr. Johnson.
-You've finished taking me
-for an ass, or are you beginning?
-Let go of me
But answer me
I don't understand, what are you talking about?
Realize, Princess. I don't know what you're talking about either
It's always like that.
You never understand anything
Y es, it's always like that.
You never understand anything
And one night, you end it in death
-Which way are you going?
-12, Enrico Fermi
That's after Heisenberg Boulevard, not far from Mathematical Park
I have a car, I can give you a lift, if you wish. -O.K.
I'll get the keys
-You don't want me to court you?
-What?
You really don't know what it means?
Her smile and her small, pointed teeth reminded me of the old vampire films the sort they used to show at cinerama museums
I'm a programmer, second class
Natasha's a name from the past
Y es, but in life, one can only know the present
No one's lived in the past, or will live in the future
Thanks for the lift, anyway
It's a pleasure to do my job,
Mr. Johnson
It's much farther?
You know we must cross the North Zone, Miss
What's the population of Alphaville?
Don't forget, you must go to Residents Control
Yes
What exactly do you do for a living?
I work for a newspaper
Professor Vonbraun is your father?
It's vital that I write about him;
Could you arrange a meeting?
I don't know. I've never seen him.
I'll ask
Finally, I leave you
-Here?
-I've changed my mind
You have the address?
Yes. Tell him to stop
Telecommunication
I'd like to telecommunicate
-Galaxy or local call?
-Local
Cabin 2
Miss, do you know that man?
Of course I know him.
Don't be stupid
At the end of Galata Bridge one finds the Red Star.
My place
You can't compare it to our splendid galactic corridors all a-glitter with luxury and light
It's only a vast labyrinth, tall, cramped
Is this the Red Star Hotel?
Y es, it is, thank you
-ls Mr. Dickson in?
-He's out
Fine, I'll wait
You have money, sir?
You can have a seat, sir, if you're tired
I wanted to see it again the tomb of the Duc de Montpensier
The reclining statue of the Prince is the work of Pradier
The Prince wears the costume of
Henry, it's me!
We've got plenty to talk about
-Where's my key?
-Where's my money, Mr. Dickson?
-My key.
-His key
And a beer
And me?
Why don't you hurry up and commit suicide?
We need the room for our cousin from the south
You come from the Outlands?
Why did he ask if you'd commit suicide?
There's quite a few...
There's quite a few who do
One can't adapt to this place
It's the method the Chinese invented about thirty years ago in Pekingville
Dissuasion is their strong point
What about those who won't adapt, or commit suicide?
-Those... they're executed.
-Y es, the authorities
But one can hide, you know.
There aren't many left
Dick Tracy, is he dead?
And Guy Leclair?
Why didn't we hear from them, or from you, Henry?
I'm sorry.
These things happen
And what's Alpha 60?
A giant computer, like they used to have in big business
Nueva York... lBM...
Olivetti... General Electric...
Tokyorama...
Alpha 60 is one hundred and fifty light years more powerful
I see. People have become slaves of probabilities
Their ideal here, in Alphaville is a technocracy, like that of termites and ants
I don't understand
Probably one hundred and fifty light years ago
One hundred and fifty, two hundred there were artists in the ant society
Artists, novelists, musicians, painters
Today, no more
Nothing. Like here
Has Professor Vonbraun organized it all?
He obeys logical orders
Then why didn't you kill him?
"Why"... what does that word mean?
I forgot...
You know his daughter, Natasha?
Who is she really?
It was him they sent to Los Alamos
His name wasn't that then
Answer! That wasn't his name in those days
Listen, Henry
We'll get out together; you'll be O.K. But first you must...
It's a terrible secret, but...
Come in, Madame la Marquise
My coat, Madame Recamier
Thank you, Madame Pompadour
Madame Bovary, Marie Antoinette
Madame Lafayette
Madame, it's love
I'll say it in Russian
So young and me
Lemmy... conscience...
Alpha 60... make... self destruct...
Tenderness...
Save those who weep
Yes, yes, that's it
The Capital of Pain
14, Light Radiation. lnstitute of General Semantics
You know where it is?
You prefer I pass through the North Zone or the South?
What's the difference?
There's snow in the North and sun in the South
Anyway, it's my journey to the end of the night
So, it doesn't matter
It was my first night in Alphaville but it seemed to me that centuries had passed
I'm very well, thank you so very much
Miss Natasha Vonbraun
-Which section?
-Programming and memory
The Central Memory...
...is thus named...
...because of the primordial role...
...that it plays...
...in the logic-organization within Alpha 60
But no one has lived in the past...
...and no one will live in the future
The present is the form of all life
This quality...
...cannot be changed by any means
Time is like a circle...
...which turns endlessly
The descending arc is the past
The arc that climbs is the future
Everything has been said...
...provided words do not change their meanings...
...and meanings their words
Is it not obvious that someone...
...who customarily lives...
...in a state of suffering...
...requires a different sort of religion...
...from a person habitually in a state of well-being?
Before us, nothing existed here
No one
We are totally alone here
We are unique, dreadfully unique
The meaning of words...
...and of expressions, is no longer grasped
An isolated word, or a detail of a design...
...can be understood
But the meaning of the whole escapes
Once we know the number one...
...we believe that we know the number two...
...because one plus one equals two
We forget that first...
...we must know the meaning of plus
I'm going
The acts of men...
...carried over...
...from past centuries...
...will gradually...
...destroy them...
...logically... l, Alpha 60...
...am merely the logical means of this destruction
Good night, Comrade
I thought I'd never
-Shall we go?
-I'll get the keys
I left because I couldn't understand a word he was saying
But it's very simple
We learnt this evening that death and life are found within the same circle
-Are you afraid of death?
-Of course not. Why?
We took the tangent to the center districts
Traffic bulletins on the radio...
...as Natasha spoke to me in her pretty sphinx voice
Pretty sphinx...
Foreign ambassadors usually attend or delegations from the districts
Why does everyone look so sad, somber?
You ask too many questions
Because they lack electricity
The essence...
...of the so-called capitalist word...
...or the communist world...
...is not an evil volition...
...to subject their people by the power of indoctrination...
...or the power of finance...
...but simply...
...the natural ambition...
...of any organization...
...to plan all its actions
In a word, to minimize unknown quantities
This dump of yours isn't
Alphaville, it's Zeroville
-What are we going to see?
-I don't know, light and sound
-Where is everyone?
-I believe; it's already begun
Hurry. We're late
It's already begun
Don't they electrocute them any more?
Darling, you know the provisions of 17th Plan took a plunge
You see, I told you so
Stay here
-lntroduce me.
-I told you to stay there we're with very important people
-Can I take a photo?
-I'll ask
Yes
-What have they done?
-They've been condemned
Only men?
There's usually a ratio of fifty men executed to one woman
But what have they done?
They behaved illogically lsn't that a crime in the Outlands?
Say, I know him.
He wept when his wife died
He was condemned for that?
Evidently
We must advance to live
Aim straight for those you love
Listen to me, normals
We see the truth you no longer see
The truth is that the essence of man is love and faith courage, tenderness, generosity and sacrifice
The rest is the obstacle created by the progress of your blind ignorance
One day...
One day...
Sorry, Professor, but I must speak with you
I never speak to journalists
I'm not a journalist
Can't we talk somewhere quieter?
-Goodbye, sir.
-Mr. Nosferatu
That man no longer exists
Are you crying?
No, because it's forbidden
Occupied
Occupied
Free
Sit there and answer when you're spoken to
I haven't done anything
Newcomers must be interrogated
Alpha 5
What is your name?
Where were you born?
Nueva York
How old are you?
I don't know... 45
What make is your car?
What do you love above all?
Gold and women
What are you doing in Alphaville?
An article for Figaro-Pravda
You seem afraid
I'm not afraid... not the way you think
Anyway, you wouldn't understand
Rest assured that my decisions...
...always have in view...
...the ultimate good
I shall now...
...ask you some test questions...
...as a security measure
No, go ahead
You have come from the Outlands
What were your feelings...
...when you passed through galactic space?
The silence of infinite space appalled me
What is the privilege of the dead?
To die no more
Do you know what illuminates the night?
Poetry
What is your religion?
I believe in the inspirations of conscience
Do you make any distinction...
...between the mysterious principles...
...of knowledge...
...and those of love?
In my opinion, in love there is no mystery
You are not telling the truth
I don't understand
You are hiding certain things
I admit I might have reasons to lie but how can you differentiate between lies and truth?
You are hiding certain things...
...but I do not know yet what they are
For the time being, you are free
I should like you to visit...
...the Control Complex
Come with me, Mr. Johnson
-Where are we going?
-To the Chief Engineer
Ah, the day breaks
Sit down, Mr Johnson
A momentous occasion
Y es, we spent three years looking for Grand Omega Minus
Well, Mr. Johnson...
How do you find Alphaville?
Not bad, if I knew where I was
You are in the center of
Alphaville, inside Alpha 60
The task of Alpha 60 is to calculate and project the results which Alphaville will subsequently enjoy
Why?
No one ever says "why"; one says "because"
In the life of individuals, as in the life of nations all is linked, all is consequence
That's the famous theory of
Professor Leonard Nosferatu
Leonard Nosferatu no longer exists, Mr. Johnson
The Outlands expelled him in 1964
Today there is only
Professor Vonbraun
I remember. He was sent to a village in the desert to perfect his invention
He was exiled, you mean
Now the Outlands wring their hands, wishing him back
They flood us with spies. Perhaps you are a spy, Mr. Johnson
You know I'm only a free man
A meaningless reply.
We know nothing
We record, calculate, draw conclusions
An hour ago, one of Alpha 60's
1.4 billion nerve centres questioned you
Your replies were difficult and sometimes impossible to codify
We deduce an above-average intelligence
We are sometimes in mortal need of superior intelligences
At other times we have a no less mortal distrust of them
So what will you do with me?
For the moment, we're ordered to show you Alpha 60
Who ordered you?
Professor Vonbraun?
Absolutely not
An order is a logical conclusion
One must not be afraid of logic.
Simply that. Period
The circuit elements... of 183 Omega Minus... malfunction
Calculating or memory elements?
Memory
Professors Eckel and Jeckel
I'm very well, thank you, pleased to meet you
Me too
I'd like to know what
Grand Omega Minus is
Our 17th electricity plan is inadequate
Sooner or later, the Outlands will declare war on us
Therefore, we decided to invade them
Directed by Professor Vonbraun,
Omega Minus will be victorious over anti-matter
I see, it's ideal
We can perhaps use men like you to tell us the weak points of the Outlands
Your tendency to dwell in the past...
...could be useful to us
We send those properly brain-washed to provoke the other galaxies the strikes, revolutions, family rows, student revolts
That's us: Grand Omega Minus
-Where now?
-The invisible part of Alpha 60
You think more of what has been...
...than of what will be
It's old, your camera
The technical...
I don't believe in it
Y es, of course
Jeckel asked why I shot the individual in my bathroom...
...when the whole thing was just a psycho-test
I replied, because I'm too old to argue. So I shoot
It's my only weapon against fatality
-What's this?
-Central lnterrogation Station
Here Alpha 60 sets itself problems
The forms and references used by Alpha 60 are too complex for human understanding
What sort of problems?
Train and airplane departures... movement of people and goods electricity distribution... crime suppression... war operations
Element Seven, Malfunction
What's happening?
It's war with the Outlands
A simple instruction...
...is usually insufficient...
...to put into...
...execution...
...a task set by Alpha 60
Do not think...
...that it is l...
...who initiate this destruction...
...nor the scientists...
...who have accepted my plan
Ordinary men...
...are unworthy...
...of the positions they hold...
...in the world
Analysis of their past...
...automatically leads one...
...to this conclusion
Therefore...
...they must be destroyed
That is to say: transformed
I don't need anyone to draw it for me
During these years, under the direction...
...of Vonbraun and his assistants...
...Alphaville had developed by leaps and bounds...
...guided by electronic brains that developed themselves...
...by conceiving problems...
...that the human imagination couldn't grasp
Foreigners were gradually assimilated...
...especially the Swedes,
Germans and Americans
The others, the unassimilatables were purely and simply killed
I walked through the threaten of executions
Usually, we would seat them
...and electrocute them in their chairs as they watched a show
Then we'd dump them into huge rubbish bins...
...and the theater was ready for the next batch
If an individual showed hope of reclamation...
...he was sent to a chronic illness hospital where...
...mechanical and propagandistic treatments soon cured him
I felt that my existence here...
...was becoming a distorted, twilight memory...
...and without a doubt, a terrible destiny
I was left only one solution
It would not be logical...
...to prevent...
...superior beings...
...from attacking...
...the other galaxies
Put in one token
Thank you
Going up, sir?
-No, I'll shine my shoes.
-Please, sir
-This man has the key.
-This way, sir
You're tired, sir?
You'd like to sleep, sir?
Y es, to sleep: perchance to dream
What are you exactly?
I'm a seductress, third class
Has your colleague gone?
Who? Beatrice?
I don't know; a blonde with long legs
She's working in the peripheral flats
We're only replacements
Ever heard of the Outlands?
Never
-Get out of here!
-Why?
If anyone asks, say you don't know
I'm very well, thank you so very much
If it isn't the little princess
I was forbidden to come, but I wanted to see you again
Not me!
Since you're here, order breakfast for me
Yes, sir
Pardon, I'm very well, thank you so very much
Me too
Bow your head
What is it?
Nothing. Just a thought
What about my breakfast?
I want to tele-order breakfast
What is your number?
You have a number?
They didn't give me one at Alpha 60
Not your control number, your room number
Ever heard of this book?
"The Capital of Pain"
Some words are underlined
We live in the void of metamorphoses
But the echo that runs throughout the day...
...that echo beyond time, anguish or caress...
Are we near to our conscience, or far from it?
These are words
I don't understand
Conscience...
And this: death in conversation
And this?
Your eyes have returned from a despotic land...
...where no one has known the meaning of a glance
You've really no idea what this is?
It reminds me of something
I don't know what
Naked truth
I know it well
Despair has no wings, nor does love
No face, they don't speak
I don't look at them,
I don't speak to them
But I am as alive as my love and despair...
And this:
Dying is not dying
And this:
The beguiler beguiler
This:
Men who change
Never heard of secret messages,
Miss Vonbraun?
A secret message?
Don't you know what a secret is?
Y es. Secrets of planning, atomic secrets, secrets of memory
Now what are you looking for?
This town is driving me nuts!
I'm looking for a Bible, to see if it's in it
Are you a complete idiot? The word
I'm looking for, obviously...
Where is it? There's always one for every room
I'm becoming afraid
Since you've come, I no longer understand what is happening
Me, I think I'm beginning to understand
Here it is
"Conscience"... it's not in it
I'm very well, thank you
It's no longer there.
So no one here knows the meaning of the word
Too bad
1 sugar or 2?
That's not a Bible, it's a dictionary lsn't it the same in the Outlands, Mr. Johnson?
Answer me now, what's it for?
Nearly every day words disappear, because they are forbidden
They are replaced by new words expressing new ideas
In the last two or three months some words I was very fond of disappeared
Which words? I'm interested
Redbreast, weeping autumn light tenderness too
When I'm with you I'm afraid
They ordered me not to see you again
Who? The Alpha 60 engineers?
-Y es.
-What are you afraid of?
I'm afraid because
I know that word without ever having seen it or read it
-Which word?
-Le conscience
La conscience
-You've never been to the Outlands?
-No
Are you sure?
Yes
You're lying
Why are you cross with me?
I believe you mustn't say
"why" but "because"
I said "why"?
And if enemy ears are listening, they heard you, too
Well, then, I was careless, because it's forbidden
Perhaps it's all right for you to use it
When did I say "why"?
Another question first: where were you born?
Here in Alphaville
Another lie. Perhaps you don't know, but you're lying
I must know the truth: where were you born?
Here. I told you
No, in Tokyorama the Land of the Rising Sun
Go on, say it
In Tokyorama, in the Land of the Rising Sun
Or in Florence, perhaps... where try to remember it for yourself, Natasha. Where?
Where? I don't know
Where the sky's as blue as the South Seas
Florence, where the sky's as blue as the South Seas
Or in Nueva York
Where the winter... Broadway glitters in the snow like a fur coat
You see, you do know the Outlands
Your father was chased from Nueva York in '64
He brought you here, so you are not from here
I know what this book is
A man who came with us from
Nueva York, he wrote these books
I don't know what became of him
They live in the forbidden quarters here; they commit suicide
I know that Alpha 60 uses them sometimes
It controls them.
How come?
Because they write incomprehensible things
Now I know: it used to be called poetry
It's believed to be secrets, but really it's nothing
When Control has an hour or so free it codifies such stuff
Like everything else, one never knows
It can always prove useful
Absolutely.
We're highly organized
I'd like to leave with you for the Outlands
But I'm afraid
Now that I've seen you
I'm no longer normal
When did I say "why"?
Why?
Because... you know very well,
Mr. Johnson
No, I don't
At which moment?
Tell me
Quite often. Last night in the corridor, for instance
This time you're lying
When I said I was falling in love with you
In love? What's that?
This
No, I know what that is: it's sensuality
No, sensuality is a consequence
It cannot exist without love
So what is love, then?
Your voice, your eyes...
...your hands, your lips...
Our silences, our words...
Light that goes...
...light that returns
A single smile between us
In quest of knowledge,
I watched night create day...
...while we seemed unchanged
O beloved of all, beloved of one alone...
...your mouth silently promised to be happy
Away, away, says hate;
Closer, closer, says love
A caress leads us from our infancy lncreasingly I see the human form...
...as a lovers' dialogue
The heart has but one mouth
Everything by chance
All words without thought
Sentiments adrift
Men roam the city
A glance, a word
Because I love you
Everything moves
We must advance to live
Aim straight ahead toward those you love
I went toward you, endlessly toward the light
If you smile, it enfolds me all the better
The rays of your arms pierce the mist
Capital of Sorrow
I must know how the chief engineer will use me
As an inter-galaxy double agent,
I think
-So it's true what Eckel said.
-What?
You send spies to sabotage the rest of the world
Of course, you learn that in school
Are you going to betray me?
You can't talk or don't you want to
Can I communicate with the Outlands from this hotel?
Just ask for Galaxy Service.
You want me to do it?
The Outlands...
I want to telecommunicate
...telecommunications are suspended for some days
-What were you going to say?
-An atomic attack on Alphaville
I'll explain later, Princess, but now let's get out of here
We must find the Professor... where does he live?
-Come with us!
-Where?
-Residents Control.
-No kidding
When he doubles up, get him
Story 842, Miss
One day a tiny man entered a North Zone cafe and said, "l want a cup of very hot, sweet coffee..." adding: "l shan't pay, because I fear no one"
He drank his coffee
He left
He drank his coffee and didn't pay
The cafe owner said nothing, he was afraid of a scandal
But when the tiny man repeated the trick a few times the cafe owner said:
"I've had it, I'll get a tough guy to beat up this tiny man if he comes back"
So, on the fourth day when the tiny man said, "l want a cup of very hot, sweet coffee..." the tough guy goes to him and says:
"So you're afraid of no one?"
"That's right"
"Well, neither am l"
"Well", says the tiny man,
"Make that two cups of coffee very hot and sweet."
Meet you outside
Residents Control
You'll stay here, Miss Vonbraun
Last night you lied
You organized Dickson's death.
Why?
Your name may be spelled...
...lvan Johnson...
...but it is pronounced
Lemmy Caution...
...secret agent...
...number zero zero three...
...of the Outlands
You are a menace to the security of Alphaville
I refuse to become what you call normal
Those you call mutants...
...form a race superior...
...to ordinary men...
...whom we have almost eliminated
Unthinkable
An entire race cannot be destroyed
I shall calculate...
...so that failure...
...is impossible
I shall fight so that failure is possible
Everything that I project shall be accomplished
Don't be so sure;
I have a secret, too
What is your secret?
Tell me, Mr. Caution
Something which never changes, day or night
The past represents its future, it advances in a straight line yet it ends by coming full circle
I cannot trace it
I won't tell you
Several of my circuits...
...are looking for the solution to your riddle
I will find it
If you find it, you will destroy yourself simultaneously because you will become my kin, my brother
Those who are not born, do not weep...
...and do not regret
Thus it is logical to condemn you to death
Fuck yourself with your logic
My judgement is just...
...and I am working for the universal good
If you plan to drive us from the other galaxies, you'll fail
You will not leave; the exit is blocked
We'll see
Professor Vonbraun - do you know where he lives?
Central Palace, South Zone, behind Raw Materials Station
Let's go
Don't budge
That way I'm sure you will keep your word
Out! Out!
No journalists!
You know "journalist" and "justice" both begin with the same letter?
Tell your boss
What can I do for you,
Mister Caution?
News travels fast here
Because we're very rapidly entering Light Civilization
At about 300.000 kilometers per second
I'm returning to the Outlands.
Come with me
Stay with us, Mister Caution
When the war's over I'll put you in charge of another galaxy
You will have gold and women
We are mastering a science so fantastic that the old American and
Russian control of atomic force will seem pathetic
I see
You oppose my moral, even supernatural, sense of vocation with a simple physical and mental existence easily controllable by technicians
Your ideas are strange,
Mr. Caution
Some years ago, in the Age of ldeas yours would have been called sublime ideas
Look at yourself. Men of your type will soon be extinct
You'll become something worse than dead
You'll become a legend,
Mr. Caution
Y es, I'm afraid of death but for a humble secret agent that's a fact of life, like whisky
And I've drunk that all my life
You never want to see the Outlands again, Professor?
Goodbye, Mister Caution
Such people will serve as terrible examples to those...
...who see the world as theater...
...when technical power and its triumph...
...is the only act in their repertoire
I was running a straight line...
...which, like Dickson's
Greek labyrinth...
...and philosophers were lost, as a secret agent was too
In many respects...
...your reactions and your modes of thought...
...differ...
...from present normality
The inhabitants of Alphaville are not normal
They are the product of mutation
Do you accept our proposal?
Answer silently...
...with yes or no
I'll never betray the Outlands
The present is terrifying...
...because it is irreversible, and because it is of iron
Time is the substance of which
I am made
Time is a river which carries me along
But I am time
It's a tiger, tearing me apart; but I'm the tiger
Look at her and me, there's your answer
We're happiness, and we're heading towards it
It is our misfortune that the world is reality
And l...
...it is my misfortune that I am myself, Alpha 60
Natasha, quick...
...think of the word love
Here
Not all the inhabitants died, but all were stricken
Those not asphyxiated by the absence of light...
...circled crazily, like ants
It was 23.15, Oceanic Time...
...when Natasha and I left
Alphaville by the peripheral roads
A night drive across intersidereal space, and we'd be home
Don't look back
-Do you think they're all dead?
-Not yet
They may recover, and Alphaville will be happy, like Florence
Like Angouleme-city, like Tokyorama
You can't go back
-Have I slept for long?
-No, the space of an instant
Where are we?
In the Outlands?
Not yet
You're looking at me with an odd face
You're waiting for me to say something
I don't know what to say
They're words I don't know
I wasn't taught them
Help me lmpossible, Princess.
You must get there yourself
Then you'll be saved.
If you don't you're as lost as the dead of Alphaville l you love
I love you
Sorry we got you up at this hour, Mr Grant.
I thought I was on vacation.
What's it all about?
I can't tell you.
- Where are we goin'?
- I can't tell you that either.
You're to stay inside, Mr Grant, and wait.
Your ID card, please.
Thank you.
- Hello, Grant.
- General Carter.
- Good to see you again.
- The Pentagon, wasn't it?
Come on.
Benes! What the devil happened?
The other side got to him.
- How bad off is he?
- Brain injury. He's in a coma.
Before or after what he wanted to say?
Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows what we're after.
That's why we have to operate.
And why we need you.
Me? I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Here's the surgeon. Duval.
Dr Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country.
Ever hear of him?
- I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
- Cora Peterson, his technical assistant.
- You'll be joining Duval and the others.
- What can I do? Except pass out.
Mike?
Yes, Alan.
Meet Grant.
Dr Michaels, chief of the medical section.
- Glad to have you with us.
- I wish I knew why.
Tell him where he fits in.
I've got a few things to check out.
We need you for security purposes, Mr Grant.
- At an operation?
- They know they failed to kill Benes.
Security thinks they'll try again. We're afraid of sabotage: surgical assassination.
- Surgical assassination? You suspect...?
- Duval. That's right.
I don't agree. Just because he's difficult...
- He's impossible.
- It's no reason to suspect disloyalty.
There must be other doctors.
Duval's the most skilful brain surgeon in the country - and he's right here at hand.
- I wouldn't know if he's trying to kill him.
- I'll be standing by. I would know.
You're to take orders only from Dr Michaels.
Understand?
- Right, sir.
- Come along. They'll be operating shortly.
See you later, Mike.
His technician OK? In addition to the looks?
No question of her loyalty.
- I'll take that, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.
I don't mean to be inquisitive, but this CMDF.
For all I know, it could stand for Consolidated
Mobilisation of Delinquent Females.
Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces.
Say that again.
We can reduce anything down to any size.
People, ships, tanks, planes.
I've heard some wild ones, but this takes it.
We can shrink an army.
Put it in a bottle cap.
That's why we call it
Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces.
If the other side gets that...
They have.
But we both have the same problem: lack of control.
They can only miniaturise things for exactly 60 minutes.
After that everything starts growing back to its original size.
- I assume Benes knows howto control it.
- Yes. He wanted us to have the secret.
- That's why they tried to kill him.
- They'll try again.
No wonder you want me to stand by at the operation.
And take a little trip with him.
Trip? Where to?
The only way we can reach that clot is from inside the brain.
So we'll put a surgical team and crew into a submarine, reduce it way down in size and inject it into an artery.
- You mean I'm going along?
- As part of the crew, yes.
Wait a minute. They can't shrink me.
- We can shrink anything.
- I don't want to be miniaturised.
- It's just for an hour.
- Not even for a minute.
Sir, I really think you should reconsider.
I just don't think I'm right for this job.
Grant, you're going to a briefing.
Miss Peterson volunteered to come.
So did every male technician. A woman has no place on a mission of this kind.
- I insist on taking my technician.
- You'll take along who I assign.
Don't tell me who I'm going to work with - not on this operation.
I'll do what I think is best without interference!
Dr Duval has relied on Miss Peterson for years.
And since she wants to come along,
I think it's for the best, Dr Reid.
Well, I disagree with you.
Since you're in charge, do as you please.
But I want it on record I'm against it.
Grant, Colonel Reid, operational commander.
You met our medical chief.
- Dr Duval, head surgeon.
- I've heard of you.
Miss Peterson, his assistant.
And Captain Bill Owens, designer of an experimental submarine for the Navy's research programme.
- Out of your element, Captain?
- Sort of.
- That makes two of us.
- Grant is uniquely suited to this mission.
He's a communications expert and he was a frogman during the war.
Besides, he brought Benes into this country.
The fewer people who knowthat, the better.
You'll find Grant invaluable should anything go wrong once you're underway.
OK, Don.
Here's the overall target area.
Doctor?
Benes's brain.
As near as we can map it stereotaxically.
The clot is right here.
It's impossible to get at without damage to the intervening tissue, which would prove fatal to Benes.
The only way to reach it is via the arterial system.
Phase one calls for miniaturising a submarine, with crew and surgical team, and injecting it into the carotid artery.
How small will it be?
About the size of a microbe.
We're putting Benes in deep hypothermia.
What?
That's freezing him as low as is compatible with human life.
It'll slow down his heartbeat, circulation and all other physical processes.
Even so, Colonel, because of our size -
I mean, the lack of it - we'll still be cruising pretty fast.
We'll be smashed to bits if there's turbulence.
The only danger of turbulence is in the heart, and we're not going through it.
Once in the carotid artery, we remain within the arterial system until we reach the point of the damage, where Dr Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam.
Thank you.
After the operation, we return by way of the venous system until we reach the base of the neck, where we'll be removed right here. With a hypodermic.
How will you know where the sub is at any moment?
Dr Michaels is a circulatory specialist and will act as your navigator.
He'll know where you are and you can communicate directly with us by wireless.
Also the sub is nuclear powered. We'll track it just as we would any radioactive tracer.
There'll be surgeons standing by to remove you immediately should anything happen.
In any event, you must be out within 60 minutes.
After that, you're in danger of attack.
Attack? Who? Or should I say what from?
Benes's natural defences.
White corpuscles, antibodies.
You see, once you begin to grow, you become a menace to the body and you'll trigger them off.
And there may be other, unknown, factors.
We can't be certain of anything.
Any further questions? Anybody?
- Just one, General.
- What's that?
Where do I get a cab backto town?
Dr Michaels, proceed to the sterilisation section.
Yes, sir.
Will you follow me?
How much can a man give to his country?
Your attention, please.
Make the final preparations.
Heart.
How's it look, Henry?
Holding steady. 32 per minute.
Respiration.
Jack, what's the report?
Respiration is down to six a minute.
I wouldn't take him down any further.
Hypothermia.
Any problems, Dr Sawyer?
No, sir.
We're holding him at 28 degrees Centigrade.
- How do we stand?
- Ready.
They're now entering the sterilisation corridor, sir.
Please board and check all your equipment immediately.
Here's the particle, sir.
- Everything aboard?
- All squared away.
Dr Michaels.
- Yes?
- Here's your chart table right here.
All the maps and charts are in sequence from left to right.
- And here's your checklist.
- Dr Duval and I will checkthe charts.
Fine. Mr Grant?
- This is your wireless station here.
- Good.
- Ocular motor nerve.
- I see.
- Need any help, skipper?
- Oh, yeah. We'll save some time.
Open this, would you? Set it down there.
- Where? On the deck here?
- Yeah, right there.
- That's radioactive material.
- It's atomic fuel.
- Is it all right to open it?
- Perfectly safe.
There's a microscopic radioactive particle inside.
Nothing big enough to be seen with the naked eye.
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
They can't reduce nuclear fuel.
But once the reactor's been miniaturised, a microscopic particle should put out enough energy to activate it.
That's cutting it close for a perfect fit.
Well, it should work, theoretically.
If it doesn't, the whole mission's off.
You see, this craft is nuclear powered.
All except for your wireless.
All in all, quite a canoe.
Designed for piscatorial research: spawning habits of deep-sea fish.
That reminds me,
I'd better spawn a radio message.
Test message from the Proteus, sir.
"Miss Peterson has smiled. "
Well, that's an auspicious sign.
Confirm receiving.
Captain?
How will you be able to follow my charts from up there?
There's no power on now, but once there is...
May I have this chart, please?
You just place the chart here and it will come through on that repeater.
- Repeater?
- Yeah, the devi...
Come on, I'll show you.
- There, that's it.
- Oh, yes.
It all seems quite simple to operate.
Actually, it is, although the controls are highly sophisticated.
Look here.
There's a button and a switch for everything.
Bet you're pretty handy around the house.
Can you cook?
We're pushing oxygen today.
I'll have some laughing gas.
You're not looking forward to it?
It's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
I think it's very exciting.
We're going to see things no one has ever seen before.
Not just something under a microscope.
- Think about it.
- That's the trouble, I am.
- Being shrunk!
- You may learn to like it.
Excuse me.
For a nice young lady, you play with the damnedest toys, Miss Peterson.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
Now I know.
That could be quite a lethal weapon.
It could kill, not cure.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr Duval.
The beam from this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimetre.
You've been Dr Duval's assistant for some time.
- He must have snatched you out of a cradle!
- I've been with him since I got out of school.
He brought me into the CMDF over five years ago.
- That's a long time with one man.
- Not working with someone like Dr Duval.
He's...
Well...
- Prepare for miniaturisation.
- Positions, please.
- I still have something to check.
- Right. Mr Grant?
There are two seats under the chart table.
Would you pull them out, please?
Secure your safety belts.
Miss Peterson, this is your chair right here.
- Doctor, let me help you.
- No, it's all right. I can manage.
- Doctor?
- Yes, Cora.
I...
I wanted to say that...
What is it? Is anything wrong?
No, nothing. I... just wanted to say... thank you for taking me along.
Thank you for volunteering.
Right, Mr Grant.
You can tell them the Proteus is ready.
- The Proteus? What's that?
- The name of this vessel.
Sounds better than calling it the U-91035.
Proteus reports all secured, sir.
Miniaturiser.
All stations, stand by.
All medical posts, stand by.
Check scanner. Computer 9-5.
Checks out on radar.
Instruct computer for a plus 6-0-9.
Phase one.
- Colonel?
- OK to proceed.
Phase two.
Elevate zero module.
Lower zero module.
Halt and transfer.
HDR in order.
Elevate zero module.
We'll submerge manually.
Mr Grant, open induction valves one and two.
- Where are they?
- There's one port and one starboard.
On the bulkhead right behind you.
- I'll get the other.
- Fine.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Induction valve open.
Valve open.
Close valves.
Valve closed.
Right. That's all for the present.
- I can't breathe.
- Dr Michaels.
- Dr Michaels!
- I've got to get out.
It's too late for that.
Now, we must go on.
I'm sorry. I...
I've got claustrophobia. I was...
I was buried alive in an air raid in England.
Two days.
I thought I'd got over it.
Please forgive me.
I'll really be all right now.
Come on.
You'll feel better once we're underway.
Thank you.
Lock and hold.
- OK, Colonel.
- OK.
Phase three.
All stations, 60 and counting.
- Inform Proteusthey are at full reduction.
- Yes, sir.
- At full reduction.
- Right.
- That air feels good.
- Yes.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm OK.
Mr Grant, tell them the Proteus is on power.
- Proteus on power, sir.
- OK, Don, it's all yours.
Phase four.
Elevate zero module.
Check thermal blanket.
Tracking.
Contact Proteus.
- Stand by for injection.
- Right.
Inject.
Tracking post.
The medieval philosophers were right.
Man is the centre of the universe.
We stand in the middle of infinity, between outer and inner space.
And there's no limit to either.
I never imagined it could be anything like this.
- No, I always thought it was nothing but red.
- Only to the naked eye.
Those corpuscles carrying oxygen give the stream its colour.
The rest of the plasma's very much like sea water.
- An ocean of life.
- End to end, 100,000 miles long.
Dr Duval?
What could those be?
That looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
I don't agree.
- We should stop and investigate.
- I'm afraid we haven't time.
Captain, keep your present heading until we're in the clear.
Arterial wall to the left.
- What's our speed?
- 15 knots.
You should reach the main branching artery in two minutes.
Keep the wall at this distance when you turn.
That should bring you safely into the middle of the branch.
- Captain, correctyour course and speed.
- She won't respond. We're in a current.
- That isn't possible.
- Not in a sealed vessel like an artery.
There's something wrong with your controls.
No, it's a current. It's too strong.
I can't seem to break out of it.
Whirlpool. Strap yourselves in.
Anyone hurt?
Cora?
I'm all right. Thank you, Doctor.
Where are we?
The corpuscles are blue.
Captain, what's your compass heading?
Proteus off course.
They've... they've crossed over into the jugular vein!
That can't be. There's no direct connection between the two.
Well, normally not.
Unless there's an arteriovenous fistula.
A what?
It's a forced joining of a vein and an artery.
It must have happened when Benes was hurt.
Yes, a fistula too small to show up in the tests.
- But big enough for us.
- Can you head back into the artery?
No, we can't fight that current.
It's impossible.
Well, try not to drift down any further.
I'll do what I can.
Is there an alternate route?
We can go forward on this course but... that means going directly through the heart.
No, we can't do that either.
We decided in the briefing.
This craft couldn't stand the turbulence.
It would be a hundred times worse than the whirlpool.
That's just dandy!
We can't go forward and we can't go back.
There's only one thing we can do.
Call off the mission.
We've no choice. We've got to take them out.
No. We've still got 51 minutes. Leave 'em in.
But it's hopeless.
They can't go back and they can't go on.
There's no choice but to remove them.
Not until the last second. We gotta think of something to save the situation.
Proteus reports trapped in venous system.
Requests removal, sir.
Well, there it is.
What do I tell them, General?
Doctor...
Without killing him, how long could we stop his heart?
- The less time the better.
- I know, but what's the maximum?
In his comatose state and everything slowed down, no more than 60 seconds.
At top speed, adjusting distance for degree of miniaturisation, that sub should get through the heart in exactly 57 seconds.
That's only three seconds to revive him.
What are the problems involved in stopping the heart?
Nothing - compared with starting it up again.
We're wasting time. Let's get on with it.
Message to Proteus.
- Cardiac red alert.
- Maintaining maximum speed, the sub should get through the heart in 57 seconds.
This will allow us three seconds to spare in which to revive him.
To minimise the turbulence we will have to arrest the heart.
Prepare for cardiac shock. Remove the radar.
The Proteus will proceed to the entrance of the right atrium, at which point the heart will be stopped - by electric shock.
57 seconds.
And if it takes longer to get through?
We can't take a second more.
Captain, head in the direction of the flow and then drift with it.
Well, that looks pretty complicated.
I shall be able to guide you once we're inside.
Ready for cardiac shock.
Cardioscope.
Tracking.
Listen. The heart.
- Yes. It's slowed down a great deal.
- Sounds like heavy artillery.
It lays down quite a barrage.
Over 40 million beats in a year.
And every beat separates a man from eternity.
Stand by.
They're about to stop the heart.
Full power when we enter the valve.
Hit it!
24 seconds left. Including three to revive him.
19 seconds, Doctor.
The semilunar valve should be on our left any second now.
Stand by to revive.
- There it is.
- Bear to your left.
- Can you see it, Captain?
- Yes. I see it now.
Brace yourselves. There'll be a tremendous surge when the heart starts up again.
If it does.
Eight seconds left.
Now!
They're in the pulmonary artery.
They'll make up time once they get through that and reach the pleural cavity.
Respiration post.
- What's his rate, Jack?
- Back to six per minute.
Dammit! I just had them cleaned.
They all lead to the same place: the lungs.
Dr Michaels, the channel is getting awfully narrow.
Yes, we're entering a capillary.
Try to stay in the middle.
The wall's transparent.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
Doctor, just think of it.
We're the first ones to actually see it happen.
The living process.
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
It's just a simple exchange, Mr Grant.
Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide in return for oxygen coming through on the other side.
- Don't tell me they're refuelling!
- Oxygenation.
We've known it exists even though we never saw it.
Like the structure of the atom.
But to actually see one of the miracles of the universe, the engineering of the cycle of a breath...
I wouldn't call it a miracle.
Just an interchange of gases.
The end product of 500 million years of evolution.
You can't believe all that is accidental? That there isn't a creative intelligence at work?
Well, the creative...
- Mr Grant?
- Yes, skipper?
I'm losing pressure in the flotation tanks.
Check the manual control panel.
It's aft on the starboard side.
The left tank's losing pressure.
There must be a short in the electrical valve circuit system.
Yeah.
That takes care of the valves. I suppose it happened because of that electric shock.
- Is there any damage?
- Not to the valve.
But we've lost so much air we can't make it the rest of the way.
What do you propose to do, Captain?
There's nothing we can do.
We can't continue without full tanks.
- Any reserve air?
- Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber, one of the countless alveoli of the lung, and we can't get enough air to fill a microscopic tank!
Maybe we can.
- Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
- Yes, there is.
Could I run a tube through that wall without harming Benes?
At our present size, I should think so, certainly.
If those corpuscles can take on air, there's no reason why we can't.
All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.
- How's that sound to you, skipper?
- Well, it's a dangerous procedure.
If I miss the timing we could explode the air tanks, but...
I'm willing to try it.
I think we should.
Yes, of course. We must try it.
One more thing. It'll be safer if everybody leaves the sub but me.
I'll get the equipment.
Cora?
- You didn't fasten it down too well.
- But I did! I'm positive.
- Then how come it worked loose?
- I've no idea.
How badly is it damaged?
I don't know. We'll have to test it.
That'll have to wait until after we're refuelled.
I can't imagine how it could have happened.
I distinctly remember fastening it down.
Must've been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
Better get these on as quickly as possible.
They've stopped on the outer limits of the left lung.
Another delay, with only 42 minutes left.
It'll be close but there's still a margin of safety.
Let's find out what's holding them up.
Contact the Proteus.
Must be some kind of mechanical difficulty.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
Oh, I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
- Shouldn'tyou answer that?
- Not now. We need air, not greetings.
- It's full of rocks.
- Those are impurities embedded in the lung.
Carbon from smoke and specks of dust.
Well, we'd better get on with it.
Careful! There's a tremendous air pressure in there in relation to our size.
I'll hold her from the other side of the wall.
Maybe that will do it.
- Tie my safety line to the sub.
- Here. Let me have it.
All right, now. Push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
Wait for the lull - between the time he inhales and exhales.
Now!
Full.
He's gone!
What can we do?
"Delay caused by stop to refuel air. "
"Proceeding through pleural cavity. "
"Refuel air"?
Why not?
They had a choice of over a billion alveoli.
And a broken trigger wire.
A smashed transistor.
No way to fire the lamp.
Well, that's the end of the laser.
- You must carry spare parts.
- Nothing that's built into the chassis.
- If it only hadn't come loose!
- That's beside the point now.
- Isn't there another operation you could try?
- No. No, there's no other way.
I don't see the sense in going on with this.
- But we must!
- With no laser?
If you had a transistor about this size and power output and a thin enough wire, could you mend it?
Yes, but it requires absolute precision.
A surgeon might.
Yes. Yes, I could do it.
Well, if I had the parts!
I've got a source. All we have to do is tap it.
Grant, just a minute. You're surely not going to dismantle the wireless?
It's just one transistor and a circuit wire.
That'll knock out our communications.
We'll be cutting ourselves off.
They'd still be able to track us by radar because of the radioactive fuel.
What's it to be? The wireless, or Benes's life?
Send a message to the control tower.
Message from the Proteus, sir.
"Cannibalising wireless to repair laser. "
- They're what?
- "This is our last message. "
Incommunicado!
Now they're really on their own.
We can track 'em, but that's all we can do.
Something told me I got into the wrong end of this business.
Inner space...!
The transistor will do, but the wire is much too thick.
- There's nothing closer.
- Let me see.
I might be able to scrape it thin enough.
Cora, would you bring me a number 11 scalpel, please?
Yes, Doctor.
Looks like the sea at dawn.
We're safe as long as it remains that colour.
We're in the pleural sac.
It keeps the lungs from rubbing against the wall of the chest. Up there.
When those membranes become inflamed we get pleurisy and a racking cough.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just breathing...!
His pleura's in fine condition.
Should be plain sailing from here on.
Let's hope so.
So far, someone's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
Sabotage?
I don't quite understand.
I sawthe laser before we started.
It was fastened down securely.
What happened was no accident.
Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub.
- Surely you don't suspect Duval.
- That line was tampered with.
I don't know what to say.
I know he's under a cloud, but... there's not a more dedicated man in medicine.
We still never know anyone's mind.
I don't believe it. It was an accident.
- Two in a row?
- It's possible.
Look at those walls up ahead.
We're entering the lymphatic system.
Those are nuclei of cells lining a duct.
I always had an idea there was only one system: the circulatory.
The lymphatic system drains off excess fluid from the tissues.
Without it, we'd all blow up like balloons.
- Looks like quite a navigation problem.
- Only until we get through the nodes.
The lymphatic glands.
- Keep your present compass heading.
- Right.
We're picking up seaweed, or whatever that is.
Reticular fibres.
We ought to be clear of them soon.
Well, I hope so, Doctor.
Because if that stuff clogs the vents, the engines will overheat.
What's causing all this?
- Looks like somebody declared war.
- That's exactly what it is.
Antibodies destroying bacteria or any other foreign invader that threatens the system.
Look! It's taken on its exact shape.
- It's like hand in glove.
- Much closer. Like two atoms.
We'll never get there in time at this rate.
Isn't there another route to bypass all this?
- No.
- Yes!
- There's no other suitable route.
- Yes, there is.
We can transfer to the inner ear.
And go by way of the endolymphatic duct.
- Why don't we take it?
- Because it's more hazardous than the route we're following now.
You see, once in the ear, any noise at all in the operating theatre would be disastrous.
At our reduced size, any vibrations inside the ear would have a shattering effect.
Well, they're tracking us. Once they see where we're going they'll take precautions.
All right.
Let's hope they realise the danger.
Captain, I'll give you a new heading.
Proteus turning, in quadrant 7-3.
Finally. They're heading for the inner ear.
About time they realised they'd never make it the other way.
Your attention, please.
Proteus is about to enter the inner ear.
You are not to walk, talk, or make a sound of any kind.
Absolute silence must be maintained until they are out of the danger area.
- What's wrong, skipper?
- What I was afraid would happen.
That stuff we passed through that looks like seaweed?
Yes, reticular fibres.
It clogged the intake vents.
We're not getting any propulsion.
Well, there's only one thing to do.
What?
I'll see if maybe there's some way
I can clear those vents.
How long do you think it'll take?
Quite some time.
- Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
- You're right. We haven't a minute to spare.
- Would you...?
- Oh, yes.
I'll stay behind.
I'd better use the time to finish repairing the laser.
Why don'tyou start on the engines?
Report no movement of the Proteus since entering quadrant 7-4 at level D.
24 minutes left, maximum.
This is just what we need. Another delay.
You'll wind up a Hindu.
They respect all forms of life, however small.
Help!
Please help!
There she is.
She's damaging those fibres.
Antibodies will attack any moment.
Grant?
The pressure. I...
- I can't...
- Get backto the sub. I'll get her out.
Hurry!
- Where are they?
- They're belowthe cells of Hensen.
If the antibodies reach her, they'll attack as if she were bacteria.
Open it! Open it before they get here.
I can't till the hatch is flooded.
They're tightening!
Please! I... can't... breathe.
I can't...
They've crystallised.
It's all right, Cora. It's all right.
They're on their way again.
12 minutes left.
What a time to run out of sugar.
Looks like quite a way.
We'll reach the base of the brain soon.
From there it's not far to the site of the injury.
But we're running out of time.
Where's that light coming from?
It's from the outside world.
Filtering in through Benes's eardrum.
That puts us right here.
Which means we can head for the subarachnoid cavity.
The Proteus has passed the inner ear and is now in the channel leading to the brain.
I thought I'd die when the scissors dropped on the floor.
- It's against my better judgement.
- To wait until it may be too late?
- I've done all I could with the laser!
- All I ask...
I'm only asking him that he test it beforehand.
If it doesn't work, it's beyond my power to fix it.
But if it does, there's no telling how long it'll stand up.
It's a jury rig at best and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it.
That's why I don't want to put extra strain on it by running unnecessary tests!
- Dr Duval, I insist thatyou test the laser.
- I'll do nothing of the sort!
The operation is my responsibility.
I won't do it.
All right. As usual you want ityour own way.
Only this time there's more at stake.
I know what's at stake, Dr Michaels.
Imagine! They're in the human mind.
"Yet all the suns that light the corridors of the universe shine dim before the blazing of a single thought, proclaiming an incandescent glory: the myriad mind of Man. "
Quite poetic, gentlemen.
Let me know when we pass the soul.
The soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend infinity, and the soul which comes from God is infinite.
Yes, but our time isn't.
- If my calculations are correct...
- Doctor, what's that up ahead?
That's it. That's the site of the injury, that dark spot.
- We'd better get prepared.
- There isn't time.
I don't see how you could operate and get out of here before the hour's up.
Captain, head for the removal point.
Removal point? What are you talking about?
We've only six minutes left.
Hold it, skipper.
- What happens if we overstay?
- Once time's up, deminiaturisation begins.
Then, within seconds, this ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the system.
Then white corpuscles will destroy it as they would any other invader.
How long will it take to get from here to the removal point?
- About two minutes.
- That still leaves me four minutes to operate.
All you'll succeed in doing is getting us trapped.
I simply won't hear of it.
Captain, return to the removal point.
All right.
Grant, what are you doing? 
My power's gone.
Dr Duval, get the laser.
I'm in charge. You were instructed to take orders, not to give them.
- The situation has changed.
- Nothing has, so far as my authority goes.
We've got to get out of here now.
It's suicide. 
I'm not going to let him operate.
You're in no condition to make any decision.
You're not going through with this. 
I forbid it.
- I won't allow anyone to leave this ship!
- I'm going to do all I can to save Benes.
Don't you see whatyou've done? You've given him a perfect opportunity to kill Benes.
- I don't believe that.
- Because of all his gibberish about the soul?
Camouflage, that's all that is, to blind the gullible and cover up his real identity.
A fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes!
And now you've made it possible.
I've come up against fanatics before and Duval doesn't fit the pattern.
Skipper, I'm going out there to help.
Remember, we need at least two minutes to get out.
How does it look, Doctor?
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
Doctor, we've had it.
If I can clear this central nerve, that may be enough.
Captain, there's something wrong with the escape hatch.
- What do you mean?
- Fluid is seeping through. Have a look at it.
Fluid? There shouldn't be any fluid...
Yes, you'll see it underneath the door.
That should do it.
Look!
- It's heading for the nerve!
- I don't understand.
The laser. Let me have the laser!
Give me your widest beam.
Full power.
The ship's finished.
We'll have to get out on our own.
Is there a quick way out?
- What about Dr Michaels?
- White corpuscles!
We've got to get them out.
They'll ingest the ship and everything in it.
Stay here, both of you.
Hold them off if you can.
What happened?
Dr Michaels... went berserk.
- Berserk, nothing!
- Get me out!
Get this on, quick.
If a window blows we'll lose this airlock.
Grant, help! I'm trapped! Help me!
Grant, can't get my...
Can't get my hands out. 
Get me out of here.
My hands are trapped.
I can't move... can't move my hands.
I can't move my hands.
I can't move my hands.
Get me out! Get me out of here!
Get me out!
Come on, it's no use.
- That's the end of the laser.
- You said there was a quick way out.
We could follow the optic nerve to the corner of the eye.
Time's up.
We'll have to take them out immediately.
It means killing Benes. For all we know, they may have completed the operation.
Damn it to hell!
Attention, please.
You will remove the Proteus immediately.
Remove the radar.
Prepare for trephination.
Light impulses. 
On the way to the brain.
We're nearing the eye.
Hold it, Doctor.
What is it?
That blip we're picking up might only be a radioactive particle.
The Proteus may already be destroyed.
- What are you getting at?
- If I were in their place, running out of time,
I'd abandon ship before I grew to dangerous size and use the extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible.
On my own.
Along the optic nerve to the eye.
Wait 30 seconds.
Glass slide, quick.
Open that door, please!

PITFALL
Here.
Oh, what are you making?
Hey, I brought food. You eating?
We're coming
It's hot.
It's hot!
It's getting tough, so close to the bedrock.
You think we'll hit pay dirt?
Yeah, I do.
The ground's gettin' nice and sticky.
Is that so?
Well, sticky or not,
I can feel something.
Gramps, if we hit coal, you'll be a big mining boss.
Stop kidding around.
- Look at this.
- What's that?
Smell it!
That's the smell of coal, nice and rich.
Time to eat.
Come over here.
Wash your hands.
There's nothing like white rice.
Sorry I can only pay you in food.
We're out of work anyway.
Besides, if you paid us, we'd owe you if we didn't hit coal.
Want some tea?
You definitely leaving in the morning?
Yeah.
Catching the first bus.
Where are you going?
The boardinghouse in town.
Something'll work out.
The old hick hasn't caught on to us yet.
But he will.
I'm getting out while the getting's good.
Yeah.
I hear there's bounty hunters around looking for deserters like us.
What'd you do that for?
What's it to you?
We could've made dog stew.
You should've told me sooner!
Hey, doggie, come back here.
Come back.
Shit.
He's gone.
Dogs and miners are both better off running away.
Even if I run from here now,
I'll probably just end up at another mine.
Who knows?
Could even be more hellish than the last.
Everyone knows they bait the line.
Give you 1, 000 yen, then eat you up.
A slow tailspin to the depths of hell, where you crash and burn.
What do you wanna be in your next life?
Forget it.
One life's enough for me.
Me, I wanna work somewhere where there's a union.
A union?
Yeah.
Just once...
I'd like to have my say and give my boss a good kick in the ass.
I'd like to be reborn as a demon.
A demon?
Yup.
I'd be reborn in hell anyway, and demons have it easier there.
Yeah.
A demon's a good choice.
Want a caramel, kid?
Take it.
Hey, look!
They're hiring.
Hello?
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
The Marusan warehouse at 8:00.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Stand there like a telephone pole and a dog's gonna piss on you.
Couple of new guys.
Sorry, we don't need any more men.
You came from a mine?
You have any proof of address?
That's all right. I don't need it.
Let's see you jump.
Jump up and down!
Fine.
You're not crippled. We can use you.
Hey!
What's going on?
A deserter.
Next, 280 yen.
Next, 300 yen.
Next, 250 yen.
Hey, you.
Me?
- Come here.
- What is it?
Isn't this your picture?
Looks like it.
But what's it doing here?
Don't worry. It's about a job.
Just follow this map to your new boss.
I'll give him a call about you now.
Is this some kind of trick?
Don't worry. Just be glad it's work.
That's right. You're lucky.
I've got work!
I'm no cripple.
Isn't anyone here?
Hello!
Hello!
There's nobody here.
Hello.
Is that the mailman?
Finally!
Excuse me...
I just wanted to ask directions.
So you're not the mailman?
This is where I want to go.
Let's see now.
You should go that way.
I thought so too.
The map doesn't show a fork in the road.
That must be the hill over there.
What a ghost town.
The mine was closed. They said it could cave in.
The men all ran away in the night.
They owed me 7,000 yen.
That's a tough break.
You can say that again.
Aren't you gonna leave too?
I'm no stray dog. I can't leave with no place to go.
A friend of mine's gonna send for me as soon as he gets himself settled.
Well...
I should get going.
Sorry for the bother.
Stop that!
Thanks.
Why doesn't he write?
Was he lying?
You saw all that, didn't you, ma'am?
It's quite all right.
I'd like to ask for your cooperation.
If the police ask, tell them...
"The killer looked like a miner.
He wore split-toed work boots, so the footprints will be easy to spot.
He threw the knife in the marsh.
Then he came and threatened to kill me if I talked.
Then he left and hurried north.
He looked...
35 or 36.
He had a round face and a bald spot above his right ear. "
That's how it was, right?
Am I dead?
Where the hell did he go?
What did he have against me?
Pops, did you see a guy with white gloves?
Hey.
Little boy.
Lady, did you see a man with white gloves?
Please tell me!
Can't you hear me?
What's the matter?
You can't hear me, can you?
I guess not. I'm dead.
The living can't hear ghosts.
She probably can't see me either.
I guess she can't.
Being invisible might have been useful when I was alive, but this is unbearable.
Lady, I'm telling you, this is really terrible!
Hey! Your daddy's dead!
Go ahead, take it. I paid for it.
Wait for me right there!
Who are these people?
Yes, sir.
He had a round face, and a bald spot right here.
Bald spot?
Right ear?
How big was it?
Well... about this big.
He was dressed like a miner.
Must've been two miners in a brawl.
You bitch!
Why is she spreading these filthy lies?
A quarrel... two miners.
All right.
Give me the details later.
Hey, shut the kid up!
I'm busy right now.
- Did you touch the corpse?
- Of course not.
Hello.
We've got a murder.
Yes, sir.
Here's the information.
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.
This way.
That's the crime scene.
Please go ahead.
I was looking out my window, and I saw them heading in that direction.
They started scuffling, and one was killed.
You were looking from that house?
Get a shot of the whole scene with the body.
Describe the body's position in detail.
The killer ran this way?
Place a marker here.
Careful not to disturb the footprints.
Where shall I stand?
Over there's fine.
Morning. A murder, huh?
Looks that way.
Any leads?
That's what they're looking for.
I heard there's a witness.
- A woman from a candy store.
- I see.
No pictures.
Here... and here.
The fatal wound was to the heart.
Could you pull that up a bit more?
That's fine.
What about there?
- The carotid artery?
- Right here.
Get a shot of this.
- Got it.
- Man, he really got worked over.
Is that your corpse?
You can see me?
Of course. I'm a ghost too.
What happened to you?
A cave-in.
Can't you straighten your neck?
The dead stay forever as they were at death.
Did you eat just before dying?
No, I didn't.
That's really rotten luck.
You'll be starving forever.
Too late now though.
That woman! Why'd she lie like that?
Who cares? It's not worth getting upset about.
They can't nab the killer unless she tells the truth!
The dead only upset themselves by worrying about the living.
Let's go. Forget about them.
I've got to know why!
I wanna see that guy in white gloves get caught and confess.
Why did I have to die?
Why you gotta know that?
I can't rest in peace until I do.
The newly dead all talk like that.
They think it'll let them rest in peace.
But it never works that way.
The more you find out, the deeper the mystery, and the more you suffer.
Give it up. Let's go.
When you die, it's best just to accept the mystery.
But I can't rest in peace until I know!
The new ones all talk like that.
I'm warning you, the more you know, the worse it'll be.
He was the chief of Union
No. 2 at the Hirakawa Mine.
The chief?
This might be a big scoop.
Investigators may be back to search for the knife, so don't let anyone on the property.
This is horrible.
I should move away from here soon.
I'll come around tonight on patrol.
You're a witness, and the killer might come back for revenge.
Let me know if anything happens.
Thank you. I will.
Hello?
Is this Union No. 2 at the Hirakawa Mine?
This is The Nishikuni Times.
Is the chief in?
Yes, the union head.
Is this Mr. Otsuka?
It is? So you're alive?
No, pardon me.
What'd you expect?
It ain't that easy to get a scoop.
Damn, it's hot!
I found it!
What?
The ghost is alive.
Alive?
What do you mean?
He came to the phone in person.
I felt like a fool.
That's impossible! Look at this!
What?
They look almost alike.
No, they look exactly alike.
It's the same guy for sure.
This is no place for a woman on her own.
I've got money.
Now's the time to run.
Horrible...
It's just horrible.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
Hey, what're you doing?
You're a material witness, you know.
I have to get out of here.
I guess you do.
This is no place for a woman alone.
No one else showed up?
Nobody at all.
It's really secluded out here.
It's awful. I can't stand it anymore.
Yeah, you must've been scared.
What's the matter? Come here.
I said come here!
We're all alone.
- What're you doing?
- Don't be shy.
I don't want this. Stop!
What are you doing?
No, don't.
You must be lonely, huh?
Nishikuni Times. We just called.
- What is it?
- We'd like to see the union head.
Hey, you seen the chief?
He's at the dressing plant. I'll get him.
So this is what a union office looks like.
What a huge mine!
You had something more to ask?
Can you spare a moment?
We'd like to hear what you have to say about this.
It looks like me.
Looks like you're asleep.
You're sure it's the chief?
Yeah, must be.
This man is dead.
I'm the one who's dead!
Stabbed in the chest?
Those are bloodstains.
He was stabbed in the side, neck and heart.
- So?
- Do you have any brothers?
No.
And of course this isn't you.
So it's just a chance likeness?
I'd say so.
But what a striking resemblance!
One more picture.
Does this scene look familiar?
Isn't that the abandoned pit at the Takaoka Mine?
That's right.
- You know it?
- Yeah.
We ought to. It's on the way to the New Pit.
I see.
So you've passed by there.
You mean that's where he was killed?
The white line marks the spot.
- When was it?
- Between 7:00 and 8:00 this morning.
It was a trap!
The chief was to pass by there around 8:00 this morning.
He was?
That was the schedule, but we changed it half an hour before leaving.
Then it's reasonable to suspect a trap.
You were the intended victim.
Your plans changed unexpectedly, and your look-alike, who happened to be there, was killed.
Yes, that must be it.
It was no accident!
The police didn't find the map I was carrying!
It must've been a gang.
You mean you have someone in mind?
Someone from Union No. 1, for example?
Yes, that's likely.
Shouldn't you call the police then?
Yes.
But how would we explain it to them?
Just a minute.
I still can't believe it.
They may hate me, but enough to try to kill me?
They'd only be hurting themselves.
You're right.
Maybe it was a warning to anyone defecting to your union.
Yeah! They're fighting to rein in the Old Pit faction.
Old Pit faction?
Our mine has an Old Pit and a New Pit.
We at the Old Pit broke off and organized Union No. 2.
But we've tried not to step on anyone's toes.
I was supposed to visit the New Pit, since eight of their men wanted to join our union.
I was going to stop them.
Stop them? Why?
The guys at the New Pit call us traitors and company stooges.
But it isn't that simple.
Before the split, the New Pit was the mainstay, since we were small.
We had few workers.
We were like a subunit.
We all belonged to the same union, so we pretended to get along.
But then the company moved in to divide and conquer.
It all began like this:
The company decided to lay off some of our men.
The union didn't put up a united front.
The New Pit guys didn't care what happened to us.
That's how the union started to crack in two.
I see.
The company exploited our weakness and took an even tougher stance.
How could we fight back with the New Pit selling us out?
I see your point.
A confrontation between us and the New Pit became inevitable.
I see. But in that case -
Just then the company baited us with the promise not to lay us off if we split off and formed a second union.
Is that ruthless or what?
We debated three full days and nights.
Break off and betray the union, or let them betray us?
We were in tears when we finally decided to split off.
It was hell having to do that to our fellow workers.
But are you saying things aren't tense enough to come to murder?
No, they are!
The New Pit's facing job cuts now.
One wrong move and the union will be split forever. Right?
Yes, it's possible.
By the way, do you know a man with a bald spot above his ear?
- Would that be Toyama?
- Toyama?
Second-in-command at Union No. 1.
I see.
Did Toyama do something?
- He's about to be arrested.
- Arrested?
There's a witness.
A woman, a nearby candy vendor, saw the whole thing.
She told the police the killer had a bald spot above his right ear.
That's bullshit!
I can't believe it.
Chief, you're too trusting.
So it seems Union No. 1 will be disbanded as planned.
Serves 'em right. Violence gets you nowhere in a nation of laws.
- Thanks for your trouble.
- Yes, thanks.
Wait!
You just said "as planned," didn't you?
"As planned"?
Did I say that?
What did you mean?
I don't remember saying that.
A slip of the tongue, I guess.
We have to call the police.
- We can't!
- Why not?
That reporter suspects me.
Of what?
It's a trap.
Soon the police will be suspecting me too.
Why do you say that?
Union No. 1 had nothing to gain from the murder, but we did.
Besides, it's too great a coincidence that a man looking like me was on that road just then.
Yeah.
That seemed odd to me too.
Any fool can see it was a setup.
What about the witness?
That's a good question.
She might've been pressured.
But would they go that far?
Who is it?
Sorry to bother you again.
What is it? Did you forget something?
- Who are you calling?
- Toyama.
Get me the New Pit union office.
Be careful!
It could be a trap.
Union office? Is Mr. Toyama there?
Yes, Toyama.
This is Otsuka of the Old Pit.
Mr. Toyama.
Mr. Otsuka at the Old Pit is calling.
Otsuka?
What the hell?
We have nothing to talk about.
Toyama speaking.
Is this Toyama?
What is it now?
Something urgent has come up.
A reporter just left here for your office.
A reporter?
Why's he coming here?
I don't believe it myself, but you're suspected of murder.
Murder?
Of course I don't believe it for a second.
It can't be.
What murder?
I have an alibi.
I've been with my men day and night since the strike.
Don't waste my time!
Listen, this is serious.
I can't give details over the phone.
There's some terrible plot brewing.
Can't we meet?
No need. My hands are clean.
But there's a witness.
The candy vendor in the ghost town told the police you did it.
What a load of crap!
This "load of crap" is gonna do you in!
Even a tiny leak can sink a ship. DOUBLE-CROSSER
Let's go see her together and get to the bottom of this before it's too late.
All right. Where?
Hold on.
T ell 'em I'm not here.
Don't answer any questions.
What is it?
We're from The Nishikuni
Times, here to see Mr. Toyama.
- What for?
- Isn't he here?
No. We're on strike.
You can't just barge in like this.
This is important.
You want Toyama?
Sorry, but he's out now.
He'll be back in a few hours. Wanna wait?
Fine.
I'm dead.
I'm a ghost.
I'll never know what it says, but it's too late anyway.
What a monster!
How cruel! I did what he told me.
Why'd he kill me?
Filthy rat!
And that cop!
Excuse me! May I have a word?
How am I supposed to answer you?
I'm dead.
Excuse me!
Anyone home?
I'm home all right, but I'm dead.
You better not come in.
Is she out?
You!
It's not my fault! I got killed too. Please forgive me.
Even if I'd refused his money, you'd still be dead, right?
Are you... still alive?
She's dead.
You're alive!
Damn it! I was too late.
I'll say!
You raise a ruckus pretending to be dead, but I'm the one who really got killed!
Why me?
Who could've killed her?
You two were in cahoots!
It's a trap!
Daddy.
Come here.
Hey, stop!
Is that him?
No, it's not.
What's he up to?
He wouldn't answer me anyway.
The union chief!
So it was you!
You let me die for you and then killed the woman!
Vicious scum!
Must a man become a demon just to survive?
Hey! I saw everything!
So it's you!
I saw her.
I had nothing to do with it!
I saw it with my own eyes!
Wait, hear me out.
Listen, will you?
- What for?
It's too late for excuses.
I didn't do it, I tell you!
I don't believe you!
...and then I called you...
Did he kill you?
So... you're dead after all?
I was killed in that guy's place.
We look alike.
Son of a bitch!
No, you've got it all wrong!
Some trap you lured me into!
He's not the one who killed me.
Then who did?
The same guy who killed you.
He came back?
The guy with the white gloves and leather briefcase.
Who the hell is he?
I have no idea.
Then why did you lie for him?
I'm sorry.
I wanted the money.
Well, then... why did he kill you?
I don't have the slightest idea.
He killed me without a word, took the money back, and left.
Who the hell had anything to gain by murdering the likes of me?
Double-crossers like you always have a good story!
Double-crossers?
You're the one who betrayed the Old Pit, a spineless dog who barked when the company told you to.
Fine! We'll let others decide who the real criminal here is!
You stupid shit!
One murder led to another, is that it? You're gonna hang!
We're both gonna hang, you stubborn fool!
Who'll believe nobodies like us?
Murder, huh?
You don't stop at anything, do you?
A great example for our members!
Son of a bitch! Where do you think you're going?
Stop, you bastard!
Stop, damn you!
Come back!
You don't understand a fucking thing!
They're really going at it.
That's some fight.
Fuck you!
UNITE
Who are you?
Why did you kill me?
Tell me!
Who the hell put you up to it?
Why did you kill me?
Who stood to gain from my death?
Exactly as planned.
What's that?
Look here! Tell me!
There has to be a reason to kill a man!
Why did you kill me?
Say something! Speak up!
You have to tell us!
You can't do this, you son of a bitch!
We don't understand!
Why don't you tell us?
Why did you kill me? Who was it for?
I'm so hungry!
Oh, shit!
THE END
Thanks. I'll see ya.
Yes, sir.
Hello, Mr. Reagan.
Hello, Raskin.
I see you've got the duty again.
You've been back there a week.
It comes around.
Thanks.
Good night,
Dr. Ostrer.
Good night,
Reagan.
Oh, Reagan.
Reagan, I've gotta talk to you.
I've got a minute now.
No. But I want to see you tomorrow morning.
I'll come by your house.
Fine.
What's this?
Laboratory equipment replacements.
Well, what happened while I was gone?
Nothing, sir.
The Director?
Well, you know Dr. Baxter, he's still...
Introverted.
Yes, sir.
Who's left in E Lab?
There's six, Dr. Baxter, Hoffman,
Yang, and three technicians.
Correct.
Gonna get these inside?
Yes, sir.
Hello, Mr. Reagan.
Hello, Mason.
Who's left in there?
Six, sir.
Dr. Baxter, Dr. Hoffman, Dr. Yang, and three technicians.
Dr. Hoffman.
Good evening, Reagan.
Is the Director in there?
Yes.
Working late tonight?
No.
Well, how was it on the Potomac?
Not quiet.
I...
I understand the man has given us a new administrator,
Dr. Leonard Michaelson?
Who told you that?
Dr. Hoffman.
The cleaning woman told him.
Not funny.
Well, it's Friday.
Good night, Reagan.
See you Monday.
Good night, Doctor.
Any trouble? No, sir.
Just some minor residuals.
There's a couple of crates outside.
Let's get 'em in.
Yes, sir.
Raskin just called.
Good evening, Doctor.
Oh.
What is it, Reagan?
Working late?
No. But I'll be in tomorrow.
What time?
I'll set the time lock for you.
Last time you locked yourself out until Monday.
I know.
You've been away, haven't you?
Washington.
How worried are they?
Well, they're always worried about the security of this place.
My job's like that.
What they're really worried about is that.
Yes, sir.
Did you, uh, reassure them?
No. I leave that to you.
Yes.
Sir, do you think...
Why don't you take this Saturday and Sunday off,
Doctor?
Do you good.
No time for that, Reagan.
No time.
Tired men make mistakes, Doctor.
God help us if a mistake's made here.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Good night, Mr. Reagan.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Reagan.
Good night.
Good night, Mason.
Good night, Mr. Reagan.
Good night,
Dr. Hoffman.
You are leaving, Doctor?
I'll be a few minutes.
Do you need me for anything?
No.
Good night, Hoffman.
Goodnight, Dr. Hoffman.
Goodnight, Mason.
Good night, Doctor.
Good night, Doctor.
Mason speaking.
Is Doctor Williams in?
Dr. Williams is not in E Lab.
Good night,
Dr. Baxter.
Two sixteen.
That's administration.
You're welcome.
It's Mason.
E Lab clear and closed.
Right.
Good night,
Doctor Baxter.
Good night, Doctor.
Raskin.
Yes, sir.
Reagan.
I'm going into E Lab.
The shoulder on that back road's caved in.
We ought to take care of that tomorrow.
All right.
Might as well make a note of it in the log for Mr. Reagan in the morning.
I'll tell him when he leaves.
He's still here?
Mmm-hmm. E Lab.
What time did he go in there?
Mr. Reagan.
Mr. Reagan.
Hello, Mr. Reagan?
Hello, Mr. Reagan?
Get over there and check that security door.
This is Lieutenant Raskin,
Duty Officer, Station Three.
Get me the Director, Dr. Baxter, at home, or Mr. Tasserly.
Right.
There's a phone call for you.
What?
There's a phone call for you.
Thank you, very much.
Hello. Who?
Okay, put him on.
Yes. Mr. Martin?
Well, I could, but I don't particularly want to.
Yeah. All right.
I hope it's as vital to me.
Mr. Martin?
Yes.
Good evening.
Good of you to see me at such a late hour,
Mr. Barrett.
You didn't care for a drink?
Oh, no, thank you.
Do you live aboard all the time, Mr. Barrett?
No, just some of the time.
I don't imagine your law practice is too demanding these days.
Could be better.
Yet, you can afford this yacht.
Must be rather expensive.
What can I do for you,
Mr. Martin?
We have a job for you.
We think you're the right man.
Oh? Why?
You have the background for it.
And in the past, you've been quite outspoken on the immorality of war.
Everybody says he's against war.
Not ex-United States
Intelligence Officers.
Let's take a look at some of the record.
"Lee Barrett. 1950.
University student. Pre law."
"Then active service,
Korea and helicopters."
"Detached for special service.
Excellent war record."
"Citation.
Superb lone operator who has no master in cunning,"
"secrecy or violence."
"Promoted to captain.
Recommended for three decorations."
First discordant note.
Last two refused.
You are quoted as saying that war
"had aged you so fast, you were too old to play with toys."
Rather a whimsical statement,
Mr. Barrett.
You think so?
Why did you leave the service?
Poor prospects.
Discharged, 1952.
Allowed to resign commission after altercation with a Major General.
Some people have flat feet.
I dislike taking orders under certain circumstances.
Then you got your law degree.
Passed the bar examination, but didn't practice.
Joined a government agency.
Fired.
A stint with another one.
Fired for the usual reason.
You rate rather high on insubordination.
My record is easy to check,
Mr. Martin. Make your point.
A year ago you were appointed
Security Chief at Station Three.
How do you know about Station Three?
The most secret chemical warfare establishment in this hemisphere.
Fired three months ago.
Reason? "Emotional rejection of purpose of project."
"Council for World Peace."
"Henry Martin,
Executive Secretary."
You heard of us?
Oh, yes.
But you don't approve of us?
I don't like semi-secret organizations,
Mr. Martin.
Neither do I,
Mr. Barrett.
But the Council is a potent weapon for peace.
We're not communistic or anti-communistic.
You just want a workable peace.
Like you, perhaps,
Mr. Barrett.
You have been outspoken on the foolishness of war.
That was removed from Station
Three a few hours ago.
It doesn't matter how at the moment.
Do you know what it is?
Botulinus?
No.
A vaccine against botulinus.
The contents of that flask can be cultured to provide enough vaccine to immunize any nation on Earth.
We want it delivered to this address.
Europe?
Yes.
How does that help peace?
It neutralizes a terrible weapon.
If we both have it, well, neither side can threaten the other with it.
Very dangerous assignment,
Mr. Martin.
$10,000 should cover your expenses.
I'm afraid not.
Then you refuse?
No.
It'll cost you 20,000.
10,000 each way. Cash. Now.
You mind if I say something,
Mr. Barrett?
Yes, I do.
Keep your speeches and moralities for your council.
This is a business deal.
No wonder you were thrown out of so many places.
Satisfied?
Yes.
Put your forearms on the table.
You have a strange way of doing business,
Mr. Barrett.
What is this?
A holdup?
Put your forearms on the table.
First, vaccines are not stored at Station Three.
So this has got to be some kind of a virus.
Second, no one's supposed to know anything about Station Three.
And third,
I know quite a bit about the World Peace Organization.
There's a fat, balding man who is the secretary, name, Henry Martin.
I know him.
What do you intend to do?
Turn you over to the right people.
I know this isn't evidence, but with your fingerprints on the flask, and the money, it'll do.
I guess
I underestimated you.
I guess you did.
Now, stand up.
Turn around, put your hands on the bulkhead and lean on them.
Cavanaugh? What the hell are you doing here?
Now, don't get sore, Barrett.
I had to do this in a hurry, and it's the only way
I could handle it.
Handle what?
I had to check you for security and quick.
That character's one of your agents?
That's right.
And you planned this whole thing just to see if I could be bought?
You could put it that way, I guess.
I didn't know what kind of a security risk you'd become.
People change, you know.
You did have me worried on that radio there for a moment.
Get out of here and get your tail back to Washington.
Mr. Barrett,
I'm Dr. Leonard Michaelson.
I know who you are.
You, too. Get out.
Get your props and get off this boat.
Barrett, you know the way our security agency works.
Mr. Barrett, I can understand how you might interpret this as a reflection on your loyalty...
Sir.
Barrett, the General has asked that we come to you.
He wants you in on this.
In on what?
Station Three was broken into a few hours ago.
Reagan's been murdered and Dr. Baxter has vanished.
Mr. Michaelson?
Right.
I'm Pelton Tasserly, Deputy Administrator here.
Mr. Tasserly.
Lieutenant Raskin.
Lieutenant Johnson.
Good morning.
I'm very sorry about this, sir.
No sooner take over and...
Yes, yes, Tasserly.
You know Mr. Cavanaugh?
Yes, I do.
Mr. Barrett?
Hello, Barrett.
Anything on Baxter?
Nothing. But the net's out.
All points.
What steps have you taken?
None, really. I figured you'd get here pretty fast.
So I've touched nothing, talked to no one.
I did bring in all the security people who were on duty last night.
Whom have you told about this,
Mr. Tasserly?
Well, no one, other than you people, and our security men, of course.
And Doctor Hoffman.
Why him?
Well, he was the last one out, except for the Director.
He's waiting in E block now.
Let's take a look at Reagan.
Are you with us,
Barrett?
I'll be there in a minute.
How do you see this,
Johnson?
Well, Mr. Tasserly says, and Mason swears that nobody got into E Lab.
But I don't think Reagan committed suicide in there.
Neither do I. What's the sentry dog doing over here?
He's got a lump on his head that wasn't there yesterday.
But he was still on patrol this morning?
Mmm-hmm.
I think maybe he might've been knocked cold for awhile.
Of course, being a dog, he couldn't tell me about it.
He just went back to work.
Yeah.
Has Raskin got men going over the fence?
Every inch.
Right in that corner, sir.
Dr. Hoffman's terribly distraught.
Insists he must talk to you.
Immediately, in private.
Perhaps you should see him, sir.
Hmm.
Dr. Hoffman, this is Dr. Michaelson.
How was it done?
Blow on the head.
No weapon.
Who set the time lock?
I don't know, sir.
I suppose Dr. Baxter.
Another half an hour to go.
Is there any way to work that combination and go in before the time is up?
We've got to find out if anything has happened in there.
No way on earth until those red lights go off at 8:00.
You fool with that door before that, well, you'd die quick.
It's booby trapped.
A thousand volt charge and lethal gas.
Mr. Raskin.
Yes?
We've found a break in the fence.
Don't touch it.
We'll be right there. Yes, sir.
Raskin, have your men move Reagan's body to one of the side laboratories.
Yes, sir.
Taped.
So that you can't even see it unless you look closely.
Very careful job.
Raskin, open the other side.
Cut left to right.
A right-handed man, maybe.
Or a left-handed man who wants us to think he's right-handed, maybe.
The alarm didn't go off.
The wire hasn't been touched anywhere.
Someone'd really have to know their way around this place not to trip over this at night.
The thing
I don't understand, is how anybody can get past the dog.
I don't get that, either.
What do you think happened?
I don't know, sir.
What's his name?
Rollo.
Can I handle him?
He's under sedation. Go ahead.
Easy, Rollo. Easy, boy.
Easy, Rollo.
Easy. Easy.
There it is.
What do you make of that?
Hmm.
Those are cuts.
How'd they get there?
From the wire.
Right.
Raskin, you be Rollo.
Now, you tape up your arm, stick it through, thus...
Okay, grab it.
You hang up Rollo on the wires so he can't pull free without tearing his throat out.
He'd make a noise. No.
These dogs are trained not to bark.
No matter what. Right?
Right.
Then you clobber him with something heavy, you tape up the wire and you're gone.
When Rollo comes to, he's got the world's most massive headache.
But being a dog, he can't tell anybody so he just goes back to work. Simple.
So that's how he got in.
No. That's how he got out.
Out?
Right. Look at the ends of these wires where they're bent.
He took Rollo from the inside.
Mr. Barrett, a telegram for you.
It came to our office in town.
How come you get a telegram here?
Magic.
I'd certainly like to know what it says.
I'll bet you would.
Mr. Cavanaugh, it's 10 minutes to 8:00.
I know it is an outside possibility, but it is a possibility and a horrible one.
And you cannot just kick it under the rug.
You have not the right...
What is it?
We have a very difficult situation here.
Dr. Hoffman feels that E Lab should be sealed in concrete.
Why?
Because he's afraid that some chemicals in that vault may have been broken or tampered with.
Even if they weren't, we still cannot take the chance.
The possibilities are too monstrous to gamble with.
What possibilities?
I think you better tell them, Doctor.
More than 40 bio-chemical weapons have been developed at Station Three.
I will confine myself to two which we have developed here in E Lab.
First, botulinus.
We have 1,200 grams in six flasks.
If 10 grams of it were allowed to contaminate a city, that city is a morgue in four hours.
It is an ideal weapon,
God forgive the phrase, because it destroys only people.
And it oxidizes itself.
In effect, dies, disappears after eight hours.
Well, then, it's safe to go in there.
It's been over eight hours since that vault door was closed.
And if all 1,200 grams of the botulinus were spilled on the floor, it would still be safe.
The closed air circulating system is still in operation.
So it would be oxidized.
That is correct. But there is something else in there.
It is only three weeks since Dr.
Baxter refined it and only three days since he communicated its existence to anyone.
There's something beyond the botulinus?
Yes, the second weapon.
Also a virus, air borne.
But self-perpetuating.
Indestructible.
Once released, it will multiply at a power beyond our calculations.
It perhaps, will never die.
To this virus, we have given a highly unscientific name, but one which describes it perfectly.
The Satan Bug.
If I took the flask which contains it and exposed it to the air, everyone here would be dead in a few seconds.
California would be a tomb in a few hours.
In a week, all life, and I mean all life, would cease in the United States.
In two months, two months at the most, the trapper in Alaska, the peasant on the Yangtze, the aborigine in Australia, dead.
All dead.
Because I crushed the flask and exposed a green colored liquid to the air.
Nothing, nothing can stop the Satan Bug.
What would be the last to go?
Perhaps a great albatross winging it's way around the bottom of the world.
Perhaps an Eskimo deep in the Arctic.
But the seas travel the world over and so do the winds.
One day, one day soon, they, too, would die.
The Satan Bug is behind that door.
One flask. It has got to be locked up.
It has got to be.
I must make you understand.
If botulinus is spilled, as Mr. Barrett here has just said, then it does not matter.
But, by God, if someone did get in there, and the Satan Bug is spilled, and the vault door opened half an inch and left open, then the airlock room is lethal.
Open this door for more than five seconds and everything that I have told you will happen, will happen.
I beg you, sir, seal up the door.
You cannot take the risk.
I agree. There's nothing else we can do.
We've no option.
We've no option, but to make sure it's in there and untouched.
All right, you're all set.
Barrett, if that hamster does die, you'll be contaminated.
You won't be able to come out of there.
I know.
Well, I trust your intentions, but if there is something wrong in there, I...
You wonder if I can go through staying in there?
Yes.
So do I.
Eric, do you have your gun?
If I come out of that vault with this face mask down, open that airlock door just a crack and use it.
It's below atmospheric pressure in there, so the outside air will rush in.
You'll have time.
You'll be safe.
Lee, you know if I have to,
I will use this.
I know.
There's no danger.
Baxter's in there.
He's dead.
Botulinus.
There was a accident last month, a technician.
Oh, no, it is all right.
There's just the odor now.
It's oxidized.
What about the Satan Bug, Dr. Hoffman?
Don't touch the handle, Doctor.
We need fingerprints.
It is gone.
And the botulinus.
All the flasks.
Yes. They are all gone.
It can't be gone.
It can't be. It's impossible.
Baxter walked out last night.
He was checked out. He was!
Somebody else walked out.
Good morning. Good morning.
I'm Lee Barrett.
Oh, yes, Mr. Barrett.
You're in suite 15.
I am?
Yes, sir.
You're already registered.
I am?
You certainly are.
Hello, Lee, darling.
Thank you, very much.
Don't mention it.
I thought you'd never get here.
I've read the newspaper three times and had four cups of coffee.
Well, I hope you saved one for me.
I certainly did.
What the hell are you doing here?
I'm using a new strategy, darling.
I thought you might like the Mata Hari type.
But that telegram,
"The sooner the better."
Can you think of a better way to get you here fast?
At least you could've signed it, damn it.
Hey, your language hasn't improved a bit, by the way.
You need a wife's influence.
Ann, honey, what are you doing here?
Isn't this a beautiful part of the desert?
It's marvelous, almost a hideaway.
Where is he?
About 10 miles from here.
Well, who's the cover this time?
Me.
You?
You know, you're not very bright this morning,
Lee, darling and you're certainly not a bit flattering.
You and I are spending a quiet little weekend here.
Supposedly.
Oh.
What is it this time, Lee?
It's not good.
Why didn't you say so?
I know a darling place out in the desert for lunch.
Green pepper burritos and cold Mexican beer.
Ole.
Oh, hello, Ann, darling.
Good morning, Dad.
Good morning, sir.
Good to see you again.
Hello, Lee.
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Thank you.
That's it for romance today, Lee.
I'll get your breakfast.
No, that can wait.
Sit down, Ann.
There's no reason why you shouldn't hear this.
It didn't take you long to get here from Washington.
No. I'm a member of the Mach two club now.
A little over two hours.
No, Ann came ahead of me.
I was going to talk to Baxter.
We've just learned of the Satan Bug.
Baxter hadn't told you?
No, not until three days ago.
He was quite disturbed.
So were all of us.
A difficult decision.
Didn't know what to do.
Destroy it or not.
Is it gone? Yes, sir.
And all the botulinus.
And I warned him.
You set a project like this in motion, something has to blow.
You think Baxter took it?
No, I found him in the lab.
He's dead.
Baxter's dead?
Somehow two men got into E Lab yesterday.
They must've found Baxter there alone, just before closing.
One of them threw the flask at him and then shut the vault door, then he walked out as Baxter.
As Baxter?
There must've been a reasonable resemblance, and with Baxter's hat and coat, everybody expected to see Baxter.
So they saw Baxter.
And?
The other man went through the fence with the stuff.
Reagan must've stumbled on them in the lab.
Does Cavanaugh have any ideas?
None. But he's all over the place with fingerprint men and cameras.
He'll interrogate everything, everybody, but he won't come up with anything that will be of any value.
You agree that it was an inside job?
Certainly an inside assist, but too smooth to be caught by fingerprints and conversation.
Anyhow, sir, as you know, the "how" is not important, it's the "who" and the "why" that counts.
Yes.
Lee, have they told you just what this new virus will do?
Dr. Hoffman filled me in.
It's throwing that botulinus that worries me.
That's the work of a lunatic.
There're three possibilities.
Foreign power, possible.
Criminals, hijackers, improbable.
It's the first and the third that bother me.
What's the third?
Well, you said it, a lunatic.
Well, psychotics don't generally engage in team work like this.
Paranoids do, and they're very brilliant, some of them.
What sort of paranoid?
The kind that we grow the most of in this country.
A messiah.
What kind of messiah?
Take your pick.
Extreme right, extreme left.
From the "I'd rather be Red than Dead" fanatics to "Bomb Moscow right now" fanatics.
My choice, a messiah.
Let's say you're right.
What next?
A telegram, a letter, or something to the papers with,
"Mankind must abolish war, or war will abolish mankind."
And they'll make demands and end up with,
"Obey or else."
Where were you at midnight last night?
I beg your pardon?
This was delivered about 10 minutes ago.
"Mankind must abolish war, or war will abolish mankind."
"I have what you're looking for."
"I order your Citadel of the Antichrist destroyed."
"The President will publicly announce immediate compliance."
"To prove that I am to be obeyed, there will be an incident."
Unsigned.
They were carried in.
Routine delivery of crates.
Carried in!
Phony.
My God, Mr. Barrett, we had no way of knowing.
We had no idea they'd do anything like this.
No idea at all. It's...
It's so simple it's ridiculous.
It's always the simple way that works.
Nothing?
Nothing.
Only the fingerprints that belong here.
The crates were coded with the right number, the right color.
And they were delivered late Friday afternoon, at 5:35.
No reason for the technicians to open them.
Exactly.
We're just to see that nothing gets out.
Nothing. Everything that comes in stays...
Eric.
The General's here.
He got this this morning.
It was phoned in last night.
Pay phone,
Los Angeles Airport.
My God.
How did they even know he was here?
Good question.
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Rip this whole place apart.
Get everybody in here.
Everyone else connected with this place.
Work them over.
Meanwhile, we'll keep the whole area completely sealed off.
I think, except for sealing off the area, we should do the exact opposite.
What do you mean?
Everybody here, at E Lab, knows exactly what happened.
Certainly whoever took the bugs know.
But nobody outside knows anything yet.
Keep it that way.
Leave it wide open.
Why?
So we don't force anybody underground.
Eric, there's got to be at least an inside assist from someone here at Station Three.
Whoever it is, let's keep them in the dark.
Let's hope they make a move, and if they do, we'll know it.
It may be the break we're looking for.
Pretty dangerous, Lee.
Lot of ways to make a slip.
You know how long it'll take to interrogate everybody.
Cross check stories, and run down leads.
We're under a time gun.
You cannot conduct this like a normal investigation.
We've got to hope that somebody, somehow, will lead us to the bugs.
Only the flasks are important, nothing else.
- What do we say about Baxter?
- Tell them nothing.
What about this?
It doesn't exist.
I'll give the word to Raskin.
Raskin.
Anything, Mr. Barrett?
Mr. Cavanaugh will be in in a moment.
That was a very brave thing you did,
Mr. Barrett.
To go into that vault.
Maybe I knew there wasn't any risk.
How could you know that?
Well, certainly, whoever planned this had accurate information.
Very accurate information.
Like me you mean?
I'd put me at the top of the list.
Why would you steal the Satan Bug, Mr. Barrett?
Possession gives one limitless power.
Military power?
And political power and limitless wealth.
The Satan Bug could make one god on earth, or the devil, if you please.
Isn't that enough to tempt anyone?
Dr. Hoffman, how long will it take us to develop a vaccine against the Satan Bug?
As a scientist,
I cannot say never, but...
Dr. Baxter was not getting anywhere, none of us were.
Tasserly, institute a crash program.
Now.
Yes, sir.
Sir, except for those present, we're taking the official position that nothing is missing.
There's been a murder, that's all.
We say nothing to anyone.
A murder?
What about Dr. Baxter?
There's a dead body in there.
It'll keep till Monday. Dr. Baxter's just missing.
Meanwhile, of course, we'll proceed with the investigation.
How?
The usual way.
What are we supposed to do?
What do you propose,
Mr. Tasserly?
I think I will stay here at Station Three, if you do not object.
I'm very tired, and I do not feel like going home.
I'll go with you.
Somehow, I...
Well, I should like to be on call.
I will be in D Wing rest area.
Do not hesitate to awaken me.
Very well.
The General is here,
Dr. Michaelson.
All of this is being transmitted to Washington in detail.
All right.
I'll be in administration with Tasserly.
Station Three personnel?
Yes.
That telegram.
Could there have been a leak?
I mean, you don't think it was a phony, do you?
It could be a maneuver.
The bugs are gone.
A lunatic with the killer of all times.
Gives me the creeps.
This whole operation gives me the creeps.
How was Florida?
Okay.
Quick trip.
No quicker than it was scheduled.
How'd you make out?
I made out fine.
Where's Ainsley?
I don't know.
When did he get here?
He didn't.
What do you mean, he didn't?
I mean he didn't get here.
And he didn't call.
Did you call him?
No, I didn't.
Hello.
Yeah, this is
Dr. Ostrer's house.
Oh, I'm just the air conditioning man.
I'm fixing the unit.
Well, he just stepped out.
He said he'd be right back. Can I take a message?
To call who?
Ah, Ainsley?
How do you spell that? A-N-S...
A-I-N-S-L-E-Y.
Ah, that's right, Mr. Ainsley.
What number?
What the hell are you doing here?
Do you usually make a habit of hanging around people's swimming pools?
I do when I see that.
Is that Ostrer?
Yeah. They wiped him out.
Could he have been the inside assist?
Could be.
Cavanaugh, please.
Cavanaugh, Barrett here.
I'm at Ostrer's. He's dead.
It's murder to me, but it looks like it could be suicide.
He's floating at the bottom of the pool.
I'll fill you in on the details later, but more important, see if you can check a call that just came in to this number a minute ago.
What does the name
Ainsley mean to you?
Charles Reynolds Ainsley.
Uh-huh. That's him.
Millionaire crank.
Right at the top of the list of crackpots.
A place in New York,
Santa Barbara and another one,
I think, somewhere outside of Phoenix. Nail him.
Don't touch him, but don't let him out of your sight.
And don't let him know he's being followed. Okay.
Now, honey, what are you doing here?
I was looking for you.
The incident?
Florida.
Well, it's happened, Lee.
Key West, Florida.
About an hour and a half ago.
We have helicopters in the area making 16 millimeter films of everything they can see from the air.
Meanwhile, the coast line is blocked off and we're at the present time clearing the ocean for 200 miles off shore.
How'd it happen?
Nobody seems to know, exactly.
One reports says there was a small explosion.
Then everyone downwind started dying.
We've closed down all the news media, but we won't be able to keep it quiet for long.
What's the attitude in Washington?
I would describe it as controlled panic.
What do they expect you to do?
Find whoever it is.
Deal with him.
Buy him off, kill him, whatever's necessary.
But meanwhile?
Yes. Speaking.
Oh, are they clear?
That bad, huh?
When will the film be here?
Well, yes, he's here now.
I'll tell him.
I'll get back to you as soon as I've seen the film.
Goodbye.
They have the film on Florida and they're shipping a print out here right away.
Cavanaugh tells me that he and his staff have drawn a complete blank.
They checked out everything and everybody in Station Three, except Hoffman.
I want you to get on Hoffman.
And push Cavanaugh on that Ainsley lead.
That's the only one we've got.
And we're not going to be able to control this thing very much longer.
Yes, sir.
Oh, that film is going to arrive at Station Three about 4:00.
Get it here as soon as it arrives.
Get me this number, will you, Ann?
Now, you left the research center in Zurich after you accepted your position here.
Is that correct?
Yes. But as you know,
I went on a four-week motor tour before I reported.
Reported to Washington?
Yes. Well, actually, to the United States Counsel at Naples before I boarded the Da Vinci.
And that was in...
That was five months ago.
The exact date was...
Oh, I have it here.
You were out of touch while touring?
I had no set plans.
I motored through the Tyrol, across the Brenner,
Lake Lugano.
Naturally, if I had been needed here immediately...
It was a... It was kind of therapeutic irresponsibility.
Lee, we just got the last word on Ainsley.
Looks like we're on target.
Excuse me.
Mr. Barrett.
Yes?
That bulletin over the radio about the trouble in Florida, the...
It sounded as if...
We think it's the botulinus.
My God.
Why, Mr. Barrett?
We don't know.
But for what purpose?
We're trying to find that out. Excuse me.
He's disappeared.
The Santa Barbara house and the Phoenix place have been closed for months.
He was last seen in his New York place.
How long ago was that?
Eight months.
We ran everybody who ever said hello to him through the wringer.
His ex-housekeeper in New York said that he told her he was going on a world tour.
Somebody bought the tickets.
Travel agency must have a schedule.
She said Ainsley is not the kind of man you ask questions of.
Well, what does he look like?
We have any pictures?
No.
There's no reason for anybody to keep a file on him.
No pictures, newspaper morgue, no personal stuff?
None. He's an eccentric.
No pictures, no relatives, no public life.
Visual description from all concerned.
Age, 50-something. Height, medium.
Hair, brown. Coloring, normal.
Distinguishing characteristics, none.
No other leads, nothing?
No.
If anybody could beat any haystacks any flatter than we have.
Lee, look. He's the only name that's dropped into this from the outside.
And he's vanished from the face of the earth.
Everything we know about him fits the man that sent that telegram.
Lunatic fringe, crank, rich, with resources.
Now, it's too much to be a coincidence.
Barrett here.
Thank you.
The film is here.
I thought something had happened when I didn't hear from you.
What?
I see.
Everything's perfect here.
What?
Where?
Where?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, we can.
Well?
No doubt about it.
Williams here. Thank you.
Hello, sir.
We're looking at the film now.
Michaelson said there's no question about it.
Did they tell them everything?
No, sir, I'm sorry,
I can't.
Not a thing.
I understand. Goodbye.
Well, they've had to give the press everything.
Except the connection with Station Three.
Hello.
Yes.
Who is this?
Who is this?
All right, I'm listening.
Go ahead.
You have seen what I have done in Florida.
You have ignored my order.
Continue, and you will sacrifice hundreds of thousands of innocent lives.
Who is this?
Who is this?
My name is
Charles Reynolds Ainsley.
Now listen, don't hang up.
I'll agree to meet you anywhere you say.
But you must realize that we have to discuss...
Operator! Operator!
A call just came through on this phone, trace it.
Why not?
This is vitally important.
Well, why is it impossible?
I see.
This number can be reached by an area code number.
That call could have come from any place in the country.
It would take a week to track it down, if then.
Don't interrupt.
All right,
I'm listening. Go ahead.
You've seen what I've done in Florida.
You have ignored my order.
Continue, and you will sacrifice hundreds of thousands of innocent lives.
Los Angeles next.
Noon tomorrow!
Who is this?
Who is this?
My name is
Charles Reynolds Ainsley.
Now listen, don't hang up.
I'll agree to meet you anywhere you say.
But you must realize that we have to discuss...
Operator! Operator!
A call just came through on this number, trace it.
We have to get every man in the country to find him.
We're already doing that, but it's too late, he could be anywhere.
And he has those flasks.
Yes, I know that General, and we can't evacuate Los Angeles.
We don't have time.
We'll have to try.
Meanwhile, we keep stalling and hope for a break.
Sir.
Don't you think we should capitulate?
Station Three will only be the beginning.
It's a bluff. It must be.
No one would do such a thing.
Are you prepared to take that chance?
Bring the tape recorder with you.
There's no point in continuing this charade of hiding out here.
Lee, I'd like to have you check out...
What is it?
Why did he give his name?
It doesn't make any sense.
It would have been better to keep us guessing.
I don't agree.
That's exactly what a paranoid would do.
You heard that voice.
A monstrous ego working.
No, sir, there's something wrong.
What?
I can't put my finger on it,
I don't really know.
We'll be at Station Three.
I checked out the car for you, Lee.
He got a flat coming down the canyon.
Where?
It was picked up about a half mile down the road.
A couple hundred feet above split rock.
You remember, we caught some trout there.
You can still see the marks on the shoulder.
See you.
What's the significance of the car, Lee?
Nothing, just checking, you check everything.
Is that where the car got the flat?
Well, the car slipped off the jack.
Obviously, he tried to dig a hole to get it back on and couldn't, so he abandoned it.
Come on.
All right, sit down here, Ann.
Now follow me on this.
Everybody figures that whoever took the bugs got out.
They're gone.
The inside assist,
Ostrer, he's dead.
But let's suppose that there's another man that's tied up in all this, who's still here, who can't get out.
Why does he have to get out?
Why doesn't he just stay here?
Because he's got something vital.
Something that Ainsley's got to have, and he's got to have in a hurry.
I don't understand.
Two men got into E Lab.
One got out as Baxter, he walked out.
The other one through the fence with the bugs.
Let's say that they met this third man, who took all the flasks, except two, which he gave to them, and then they took off, probably in Baxter's car.
One flask for Florida.
One for Los Angeles.
I've got that.
Now, let's say that this third man takes off with the rest of the flasks.
But he's got one more thing that he must do.
Knock off Ostrer, who's a threat somehow.
Let's say he knocks off Ostrer, comes down this road, free and clear.
And then the nightmare of all criminals happens.
The senseless accident.
The flat.
Right!
He tries to fix it, the car slips off the jack.
Now he's stuck.
What would you do?
I'd hitchhike down the road.
But the bugs?
You couldn't take a chance on taking them with you and you wouldn't leave them in the car.
So, where would you put them where they'd be safe?
Where you could get to them when you were free to and where they'd stay cool.
The water.
I'd hide them in the water.
That's what I think.
Lee!
Whose car was that?
Just stand.
Perfectly still.
Handle that gently.
Those misses were intentional.
Stand exactly where you are, Ann.
And that I presume was Doctor Baxter?
Just put the flask back in the box.
Sit down.
There's a phone call for you in the administration,
Mr. Cavanaugh.
Thank you.
Absolutely no sign of them.
We checked out
Barrett's car.
No sign of violence there or anywhere.
Just some footprints down by the bank of the stream.
Nothing else.
Have you heard anything here?
No.
He hasn't been missing long.
He could be anywhere.
You know what he's like, sir.
I don't understand why Barrett is so interested in Dr. Hoffman's car.
I don't either, sir.
The Highway Patrol officer said...
Yes?
Mr. Cavanaugh?
Johnson's on the line.
Put him on.
Hello?
Yes, Johnson.
No sign of them in any of the places we've looked in town.
Keep looking.
Yes, sir.
The officer said that Barrett just wanted to know where the doctor had had the flat.
Well, so what? We knew about it.
You had a flat last night.
You started to hitchhike, they picked you up outside of town and brought you here.
I was very lucky.
That road is lonely at night, but I was picked up in the canyon.
Not outside of town.
Yes.
Barrett is liable to call us anytime from anywhere.
I think it means nothing.
I've pulled all the roadblocks.
You want me to put them back, just in case?
No point in that.
Yes?
There's a call for Dr. Hoffman.
Put it through. Doctor.
Doctor Hoffman?
Yes.
Hello, Gregor, this is Donald.
Sorry to disturb you, but we were going fishing this afternoon, remember?
Well, I... I couldn't,
I was tied up here.
Sorry you missed out, the fishing was good.
Do you have to work tonight?
We're at your trailer. How about dinner?
Well, Donald,
I... I do not see how...
I wish you could.
There's something I want to talk to you about.
Well, it would be very nice, Donald...
There's no need for you to stay here now.
Jeff, run the Doctor home.
All right, Eric.
Thank you.
I will be there in a few minutes, Donald.
Good.
Thank you.
He stopped on the road, slid down the bank, and got to the flasks before we did.
This is the only place we had to hide 'em.
I know it was taking a chance to call you.
But I was afraid you were caught.
He knew about your car.
Now we're stuck.
There are roadblocks all over the place.
Everything's fine, Donald.
Nobody's suspicious, and the roadblocks have been removed.
It seems that Mr. Barrett is so unpredictable that nothing has been made of their disappearance.
Did Los Angeles go as planned, Veretti?
I put it there.
We will take them with us.
That's dangerous.
If there is any trouble, they will be our best protection.
There's nothing happening yet.
They're still all in the trailer.
What about the manager?
Oh, we're keeping the manager out of the way.
Do you think Barrett saw you?
Possibly.
But he'd never recognize me, he's never seen me before.
Can you see anything going on in there?
There's no movement, no sound, no, nothing happening.
Keep on the line.
Why would Dr. Hoffman be connected with this?
Why? I don't understand.
He checked out perfectly.
There's nothing in his background to indicate that he's...
Dr. Michaelson, please.
We've got to grab them, sir.
Right now.
Certainly not,
Cavanaugh.
Now, we know that Barrett is in Dr.
Hoffman's trailer with two strange men.
And we know that Dr. Hoffman is there and he's connected with those men.
And we know Dr. Hoffman's car had some special significance to Barrett.
And that's all we know.
We don't even know if Barrett went there willingly or unwillingly.
Let me grab them, sir, and I'll find out.
I don't think you'd find out anything that would be worth losing the only advantage we have.
What is that?
They will lead us to Ainsley, to the flasks.
Only the flasks are important.
This is the break we've been praying for.
They're going to leave.
We let them.
Then we shadow them, very carefully.
Let one eager beaver show our hand, and we're through.
Now set it up.
In the desert we're okay, not much traffic.
But we could lose them in the first town.
And what if they head for that mess that'll be coming out of Los Angeles?
We'll change our strategy by then.
At least we'll know which way they're headed.
Set it up.
Yes, sir.
The evacuation of
Los Angeles is under way.
It is too early to say yet how effective this will be, or how possible it will be.
There is no further official word as to the exact imminence of the threat.
It means nothing.
There are military training fields all around here.
Incident in Florida is related to this situation.
I'm staying above and behind them.
They're still traveling west on 17.
They seem to be stalling.
They're almost going around in circles.
Why?
Evasive action.
They're taking the long way to wherever they're going.
It's getting a little difficult to keep them in sight.
This is pretty rough country and it's closing in on the road.
I don't like this section they're going through.
It's impossible to keep visual contact without the chopper tipping its hand.
There are only three points they can come out of there, here, here and here.
You have men covering all of them, haven't you?
Yes, sir. I'll double up here and here.
I'm going to lose them for a long stretch now.
Unless I close in.
Don't close up, stay out of sight until you can pick them up on the other side of the section.
Will do.
Where's your follow car?
Right here.
Tell him not to move until he can make absolutely sure that the road ahead is clear.
Yes, sir.
Hold your position unless you can see the road is clear ahead.
Understood.
You'll have no problem, Veretti?
None.
You know where I'll be.
It'd be better if we stayed together.
Got 'em again.
They're moving down the grade.
They're going to be out in the open desert any minute.
Back away to 1-1-9-30 and stay out of sight.
Right.
Tell your follow car to close up.
Zebra to X-Ray.
Position ahead clear now, move up.
Understood. Moving up.
Donald!
Is he following?
I don't know.
Take that turn.
They've turned left onto Seco Road now.
They slowed down and...
Well, for a moment we got awfully close to them.
Did they see you?
Well, I'm not sure, they might have.
You want us to take them if they spot us?
No!
Only if they stop, and if they do, get on the radio immediately.
Understood.
Pull in up there and let's see what this is.
Damn!
Hello, Zebra, come in!
This is X-Ray.
Hello, Zebra, come in.
This is X-Ray.
Hello.
Ah, it's dead.
Come out and keep your hands up!
Show yourself and keep your hands in the air.
Come out and show yourself.
We're armed with riot guns.
Now, come out of there with your hands up!
All right, drop that gun.
Tell them I'll throw it.
Don't move.
Just do exactly whatever he tells you to do.
Toss the shotguns on the ground.
Throw them down.
And the revolvers.
Easy!
I'm now hovering over 1-1-9-3-3-0.
Nothing but empty road.
Stay put.
Veretti?
What about the girl?
Why don't you take her with you?
Lee.
Take her with you.
Ann, get out of here.
What the hell kind of a thing was that?
Shh!
Don't you see, he's going to throw the flask.
It'll probably come through one of those two holes.
Where ever it comes through, we've got to grab it.
We've got to.
If it smashes on the wall or the floor or any of these objects, the three of us are dead men.
If we miss it,
I'll douse it with this.
It's hygroscopic.
It has an affinity for water.
This isn't water, it's kerosene.
It's got water in it.
Besides, it's all we've got.
Sand. Put sand on it!
Lee!
Let's go!
Zebra to X-Ray.
Zebra to X-Ray, come in.
Something's wrong,
Cavanaugh.
Two more minutes, and we go in there.
Zebra to X-Ray, come in.
Come in, X-Ray!
Zebra to X-Ray.
Zebra to X-Ray.
Come in, X-Ray.
This is Zebra, come in, X-Ray.
Zebra to X-Ray, come in.
Zebra to X-Ray, come in.
Come in, X-Ray, come in.
Zebra to X-Ray.
Zebra to X-Ray.
Come in.
Zebra to X-Ray, come in.
Come in, X-Ray.
This is Zebra, come in, X-Ray.
Come in, this is Barrett.
Cone in, X-Ray, this is Zebra.
Come in, this is Barrett.
Cone in, X-Ray, come in.
Move and I'll smash it!
I'll never be taken alive.
Your friends can't help you.
You're on your own now.
I always have been.
You might be able to take this away from me before I could smash it.
But it would not help you.
The flask in Los Angeles.
Exactly.
You cannot evacuate the city.
If anything happens to me,
Los Angeles will be a cemetery by this time tomorrow.
If things go your way and it's announced that Station
Three is being destroyed, will you take me to where the flask is and immobilize it?
Perhaps you had better get in the car, Mr. Barrett.
On the other side.
I determined in the laboratory that only a four and a half pound pressure shatters this flask.
I can easily apply that.
I spotted the station wagon again.
They're still moving north on Seco Road.
Any sign of the follow car?
No.
It looks like there's some kind of fire back there where they came from.
A lot of orange flame on the horizon.
You'd better get somebody in there, fast.
What are your plans now, what do you intend to do, Mr. Ainsley?
Ah, I can't believe how stupid I've been.
Ainsley's been missing for months and
Hoffman's been on the scene for months.
Or at least you're an impersonation of the real Hoffman.
What happened to him?
That's not hard to figure.
Gregor Hoffman, living in Vienna, hired by Baxter from Austria.
Did you kill him or did you have him killed?
You're no biochemist, how did you fool them?
I am a biochemist,
Mr. Barrett, of sorts.
If you were more familiar with the name Ainsley, you'd know I made my fortune in patent medicines.
Sometimes a little bit of knowledge goes a long way.
The accent? Easy.
I lived for years in Austria.
Besides, Gregor Hoffman, though he lived an obscure life, was a world famous chemist.
You don't ask a famous chemist the formula for salt.
But Ostrer did.
You had everyone fooled but Ostrer.
He knew you weren't the real Hoffman, so he died, too.
That tone is surprisingly juvenile,
Mr. Barrett.
I believe that hundreds of people might have died in Florida.
This afternoon when I was interrogating you, you heard Cavanaugh say that.
Ainsley was our man.
Then you knew what to do.
Somehow you made two telephone calls.
One to your boys to pick up the flasks where you had to leave them in the stream and the other to the General.
So you could give us your ultimatum on Los Angeles.
Use the name C.R. Ainsley so he would drop the road blocks and you could get out, and he fell for it.
That's correct.
I didn't make the telephone calls somehow,
Mr. Barrett.
I made them from
Station Three.
As you're so fond of saying there's no such thing as perfect security.
Don't try it, Mr. Barrett.
You're lucky but you're mortal.
We all are.
Tank vehicles carrying liquids, assembly point B.
Ambulance section re-designated, C.
Repeat, ambulance section re-designated, C.
Control requests the following be read at five minute intervals.
An unidentified scientific research installation based in Southern California has ceased operation.
It will be dismantled and cease to exist. End announcement.
There he is.
Who's that with him?
I don't know.
You're under arrest,
Doctor Hoffman.
You're Lee Barrett, aren't you?
That's right.
What are you doing here, Barrett?
That's a long story.
Get out of the car, Doctor.
Be careful, he's got a flask in his pocket.
All right, hand it over, Doctor.
Right now.
The end of the line?
All right, get into the car, Doctor.
Better come along with us, Barrett.
How did you get here?
We're spread all over the place.
This is one of
50 we're covering.
What about the girl and the two other guys?
I don't know.
Where's Cavanaugh?
They could be anywhere.
Our orders were to pick up Hoffman, stay off the radio, and don't say a word until we get him to Station Three.
Have you got enough sense to keep your mouth shut?
Yes.
We've got a jack-knifed truck up here.
You can turn your engine off.
It won't be long.
The tow truck will have it out of here in a few minutes.
Anybody hurt?
No, he was lucky.
We got a jack-knifed truck, it won't be long.
Won't be long he says.
Did you ever hear a cop say anything else?
It'll be hours.
By that time, that mess from L.A. will hit us and we'll never move.
Look at all those cans and busted beer bottles.
You'd think people wouldn't throw things out there like that.
You got a match?
Would you look at the jerk handling that tow truck?
He's worse than the man that was driving the rig.
Oh, boy, that's all we need.
A sidewalk superintendent.
Wise guy, huh?
There's your daughter, but what's happened to Barrett?
Where's Hoffman?
Dad! Dad!
Dad, Lee's dead.
They threw a flask, they threw a flask back at the gas station.
What happened to Barrett, where is he?
You've got to go clear out the area.
He's at the station.
Don't you understand?
That man Veretti, he threw a flask.
Sir.
Where is the Satan Bug?
Hoffman took it.
He changed cars and he went back the way we came from.
What kind of car was it?
It was a green Ford sedan.
License?
Oh, I don't know,
I couldn't see it very clearly.
It was FGA, something, 7, I think.
Put it on the radio.
Hey, give me that stuff.
Dad, you've got to go back and clear out that area.
That's all right, dear, that's all right.
The flask is harmless now.
The station burned.
There's nothing to worry about.
We found the bodies of Cavanaugh's men, but not Lee's.
But Lee was in the building.
He was in the building.
Well, he's not there now.
Ann, Los Angeles, did anyone say anything about Los Angeles? Anything?
No. Nothing.
Put everything you've got on Hoffman's car.
Yes, sir.
We're already on it.
But there are an awful lot of green Fords around.
And there's nothing on these guys except this stuff.
Guns, money, watches, phony drivers license and keys.
Maybe one of the keys fits something in Los Angeles.
But how the hell do we check that?
Sounds like the ignition.
Take a look at that fuel pump.
You didn't really think that I'd fall for those goons of yours posing as Cavanaugh's men, did you?
Okay, I've got the gun now.
Put the bottle down and step away from it before that copter of yours settles down.
You haven't given me any reason why I won't smash this.
This is the end of the line,
Ainsley.
For real now.
Put the bottle down and step away from it or I'll blow a hole in your head!
You're psychotic, but don't be stupid.
If I blow a hole in your head or you drop that bottle, you'll die, then you'll have nothing.
Perhaps I am psychotic, but I'm certainly not stupid.
If I smash this,
I wouldn't die, Mr. Barrett.
Why do you think
Baxter waited so long before telling anyone about the Satan Bug.
Why do you think he was working nights?
Weekends?
The vaccine!
Well, I waited for the vaccine.
Two days ago he made it, that's why he had to die and Ostrer.
You were wrong about him, too.
He didn't suspect me.
He didn't suspect anyone.
He just knew about the vaccine and now I'm the only one who has the formula.
And the vaccine is in my bloodstream.
I'm immune!
I won't die, I'm immune!
But you told us what the Satan Bug would do.
You mean to say that you'd live on this world alone?
By yourself?
I told you about the Satan Bug to keep you from finding Baxter.
Even so, he believed every word I said.
But I'm not sure how good a biochemist he was.
Some scientists thought that the
H-bomb would start a chain reaction that would blow up the world, but it didn't.
Now, nobody really knows about this.
Theoretically, yes.
But it hasn't yet been put to the real test.
Perhaps it will destroy all life.
Perhaps.
Certainly it could destroy millions.
Do you want to test it?
Mr. Ainsley?
Yes.
I was watching for you and saw the car stop.
Thought I'd better pick you up here.
The engine failed.
Don't worry about it, we'll take off immediately.
Yes, sir.
Any trouble, Mr. Ainsley?
No, no.
Well, Mr. Barrett?
The flask is still in
Los Angeles.
Still nothing?
I'm afraid not, sir.
Nothing on Los Angeles, nothing at all?
Nothing of any consequence.
Hello.
Only two tie-ups to Los Angeles.
One of them is an office building, here.
Where?
Ten stories high, we've got men going through them.
Starting from the top.
Now, the only other thing is this little notation in red ink.
Glendale 73.
We've got men calling on every house with 73, every phone number beginning with 73, every cab, well, you get the idea, sir.
Yes.
Veretti did that, he was doodling while they were waiting for Hoffman.
Hold on, Jack, take this.
Well, they found the green car.
Where?
It was abandoned in front of a restaurant next to a service station near Palmdale.
They were both closed, but a watchman in a gravel yard across the street saw the green car park and two men get out.
He described
Hoffman perfectly.
And the other man?
It sounds like Barrett.
Well, what happened to them?
There were two other men waiting in a black car.
They held guns on the first two.
Then they got in the black car and all four drove off.
Didn't the night watchman try to stop them?
No.
God!
There's something else.
The watchman said one of the men was carrying something that looked like a small flask.
No license plate on the black car?
Wrong angle, couldn't see it.
Eric.
This was doodled by that maniac, Veretti.
Look at this.
That could be a flask.
It is a flask.
I think all these are flasks.
That is something real.
He's unconsciously trying to draw or doodle something.
What is it?
Those lines look like parking dividers on a parking lot.
Sir, look at this.
A diamond?
A baseball diamond?
A baseball stadium?
Jack, give me that.
Put me on Los Angeles 47 right away.
Hopeless, isn't it,
Mr. Barrett? And pathetic.
They can't run away.
Nobody can.
There's plenty of time.
Anything?
Nothing.
Anything over there?
Nothing yet.
Telephone for you,
Captain.
It's Mr. Cavanaugh.
Hello!
Yes, we're here looking.
Nothing.
Yes, they're looking there.
Of course, we'll look in there.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
We'll be running out of land pretty soon.
And time. Where is the flask,
Mr. Ainsley?
Don't press,
Mr. Barrett.
Judas H. Priest!
Get Olsen!
Olsen!
Fifteen, 20 degrees, eight miles.
Now, here is the helicopter, sir.
We've kept everything away from it.
But we think it's the one.
Fifteen, fifteen degrees, four miles.
Here it is, sir. Here it is now.
It's a new plot.
No voice contact?
No, sir. We're on
113.6 Los Angeles radio.
They should be on this setting if they're trying to contact us.
Hold that.
That cap is fulminated mercury.
So don't drop it.
Sometimes you're booby trapped.
You cut the wires and phfft.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's it.
Now, don't anybody move a muscle, till we get this thing collected.
We're heading for Catalina.
You don't have any intentions of going where the flask is, do you?
As much as you have of destroying Station Three.
That's not very clear thinking, Ainsley.
If you intend to take Los Angeles,
I'll take you,
I've got nothing to lose.
Except this.
I see, he takes you to a yacht, and tomorrow you get on the mike and you dictate your terms.
That's right.
You'll become everything, everyone else, nothing!
And then?
Then, for the first time in the world...
What are your plans for the world, Ainsley?
War, peace, back to the middle ages?
Forward to the future?
It doesn't make any difference what you choose, because it all means one thing to you.
Power!
Power for its own sake!
You're a little man again, Ainsley.
Where's the flask?
Your life for Los Angeles.
Oh, no. Los Angeles will be my epitaph.
Los Angeles radio, come in.
Los Angeles radio, come in.
This is Williams, Lee, we've been following you on radar scope.
I've got the big one, it's safe.
Hoffman's over the side.
I can't give you any information on the other flask.
We found it, Lee, it's safe.
What about Ann?
I'm here, Lee.
She's here with us.
What was that you said about Hoffman?
He jumped!
Oh, and tell Cavanaugh to stop looking for Ainsley.
Ainsley and Hoffman were the same man.
I'll be setting down at LAX.
Tell the boys to be on the lookout for me.
I'm a little rusty at these things.
We'll meet you there, Lee.
Take it nice and easy and for God's sake make a good landing.
I'll put down safely and I'll give you the flask.
And then we're right back where we started.
This is the story of a man marked by an image from his childhood.
The violent scene that upset him, and whose meaning he was to grasp only years later, happened on the observation deck at Orly Airport a few years before the outbreak of World War III.
Parents take their children to Orly on Sunday to watch the departing planes.
Of this particular Sunday, the child whose story we're about to tell would long remember the frozen sun, the setting at the end of the deck, and a woman's face.
Nothing distinguishes memories from ordinary moments.
Only later do they become memorable by the scars they leave.
That face was to be the only image from peacetime to survive the war.
He often wondered if he'd really seen it or just invented that tender moment to counter the moments of madness to follow.
The sudden roar, the woman's gesture, the crumpling body, and the cries of the crowd, blurred by fear.
Later he realized that he'd seen a man die.
Soon afterwards,
Paris was destroyed.
Many died.
Some considered themselves victors.
Others were taken prisoner.
The survivors settled in underground passages beneath Chaillot.
Aboveground, Paris, like most of the world, was uninhabitable, riddled with radioactivity.
The victors stood guard over a kingdom of rats.
Prisoners were subjected to experiments apparently of great concern to those who conducted them.
The outcome was disappointment for the experimenters, and for the subjects, either death or madness.
One day they came to select a new guinea pig from among the prisoners.
He was the man whose story we are now telling.
He was frightened.
He had heard about the head experimenter and was prepared to face the mad scientist or Dr. Frankenstein.
Instead, he found a reasonable man who calmly explained that the human race was doomed.
Space was out of the question.
The only hope for survival lay in time.
A loophole in time might make it possible to reach food, medicine, energy.
This was the aim of the experiments: to send emissaries into time to summon past and future to the rescue of the present.
But the human mind recoiled.
To wake up in another time was to be born again, as an adult.
The shock was too great.
After sending lifeless or unconscious bodies into different time zones, the inventors now focused on men with powerful mental images.
If they could conceive of or dream of another time, perhaps they would be able to enter into it.
The camp police spied even on dreams.
This man was selected due to his fixation on an image from his past.
First, the present and all its supports must be stripped away.
They start again.
The subject doesn't die or go mad.
He suffers.
They continue.
On the tenth day, images begin to well up like confessions.
A peacetime morning.
A peacetime bedroom.
A real bedroom.
Real children.
Real birds.
Real cats.
Real graves.
On the 16th day, he's on the observation deck.
It's empty.
Sometimes he finds a day of happiness, but it's a different one.
A happy face, but it's a different one.
Ruins.
A girl who could be the one he seeks.
He crosses her path on the observation deck.
She smiles at him from a car.
Other images pour out and mix in a museum that is perhaps his memory.
On the 30th day, the meeting takes place.
This time he's sure he recognizes her.
In fact, it's the only thing he's sure of in this timeless world that amazes him with its riches.
All around him are astonishing materials: glass, plastic, terry cloth.
When he shakes off his fascination, the woman has disappeared.
The experimenters tighten their control and send him back on the trail.
Time rolls back again.
The moment returns.
This time he's close to her and speaks to her.
She greets him without surprise.
They have no memories, no plans.
Time takes shape painlessly around them.
Their sole landmarks are the taste of the moment and the markings on the walls.
Later they're in a garden.
Î—e remembers that there were gardens.
She asks him about his necklace, the combat necklace he wore at the start of the war that is to break out someday.
He makes up an explanation.
They stop before a redwood trunk marked with historical dates.
She mentions a foreign name he doesn't understand.
As in a dream, he points beyond the tree trunk and hears himself say,
"That's where I come from"... and falls back, exhausted.
Then another wave of time lifts him up.
They probably give him another shot.
Now she lies sleeping in the sun.
He thinks that, in the time it took him to return to her world, she died.
She wakes up.
Î—e speaks to her again.
The truth being too fantastic to be believed, he mentions only the essentials: a distant land, a long way to travel.
She listens and doesn't laugh.
Is it the same day?
Î—e no longer knows.
They'll take countless walks like this one, and an unspoken trust will grow between them, trust in its purest form.
No memories, no plans, until the moment he senses a barrier ahead.
Thus the first set of experiments came to an end.
It was the starting point for a series of tests in which he'd meet her at different times.
He meets her a few times before their markings on the walls.
She welcomes him simply.
She calls him her ghost.
One day she seems frightened.
One day she leans over him.
He never knows whether he moves toward her or is pushed, whether he's made it all up or is only dreaming.
Around the 50th day, they meet in a museum filled with ageless animals.
Now their aim is perfect.
They can aim him at a given moment, and he can stay there and move around at ease.
She too seems to have adjusted.
She accepts the ways of this visitor as a natural phenomenon, how he comes and goes, exists, talks, laughs with her, falls silent, listens to her, and then vanishes.
Once back in the laboratory, he sensed that something had changed.
The camp director was there.
From what was said around him, he gathered that after the success of the experiments in the past, they now meant to launch him into the future.
His excitement made him forget for a moment that the meeting in the museum was their last.
The future was better armored than the past.
After several even more grueling attempts, he eventually caught some waves of the world to come.
He crossed a planet transformed... with Paris rebuilt...
10,000 incomprehensible streets.
Others were waiting for him.
It was a brief encounter.
They clearly refused this slag from another time.
He recited his lesson:
Since humanity had survived, it couldn't refuse to its own past the means of its own survival.
This sophism was taken for fate in disguise.
They gave him a power unit strong enough to set all human industry in motion again.
Then the gates of the future closed once again.
Shortly after his return, he was transferred to another part of the camp.
He knew his jailers would not spare him.
He'd been a tool in their hands.
His childhood image had served as bait to train him.
He'd lived up to their expectations and played his part.
Now he only waited to be executed, with the memory of a twice-lived moment in time somewhere inside him.
Deep in this limbo, he received word from the people of the future.
They too could travel through time, and more easily.
There they were, ready to accept him as one of their own.
But he had a different request.
Rather than that pacified future, he asked to be returned to the world of his childhood and that woman who might be waiting for him.
Once again on the observation deck at Orly... on this warm Sunday before the war where he could now stay, he thought confusedly how the child he'd been must be there too, watching the planes.
But first he sought out a woman's face at the end of the deck.
He ran toward her.
And when he recognized the man who'd trailed him from the camp, he realized there was no escape from time, and that that moment he'd been granted to see as a child, and that had obsessed him forever after... was the moment of his own death.

When Columbus discovered America, a series of mysteries arose to confound the scholars of Europe.
Here, are two continents, completely isolated from each other.
Yet they simultaneously developed similar cultures.
For example;
The Mayans measured time, on the same principle as the Gregorian calendar of Europe.
They used the same signs of the zodiac.
The same decimal, and mathematical system.
They valued silver and gold.
Using both for jewelry and barter.
Another mystery was the banana plant.
A native of Asia, that cannot be grown from seed.
Yet, Columbus found it thriving, in the New World.
Elephants at that time, did not exist in the Americas.
Yet there likenesses were cleaved on the walls of prehistoric caves in Peru.
The pyramids in Mexico, and in Egypt, were built on identical architectural principles...
Then there was a striking resemblance of a witch of Spain...
...and the witch depicted in the New World.
But the most significant of all...
Mayan, and Aztec legends, shared with Greek, and Hebrew and Assyrian literature...
... an account of a terrible deluge.
A deluge, many believe, had destroyed the link.
The mother empire...
...that had spread her civilization, to both sides of the Atlantic.
The Greek scholar Plato, recorded this theory first, over two thousand years ago.
There was once, another continent.
I have a bite.
Look father, there.
Damn.
What?
Come back.
Demitrius, come back.
It's a trickery of sirens.
Be careful, don't touch her.
By the trident of Neptune.
A mermaid.
The flask.
Who are you?
Who can she be?
She's not one of our people.
I don't know, but no fisherman of our village, ever came home with the catch like this?
Father.
Where is this miserable hovel, and why do I wear the garb of slaves?
You are in Greece, this is our home.
The robe is mine.
You dressed me?
Someone had to.
Where are my robes?
This cloth offends my skin. they were wet, I hung them to dry.
Our fare is simple, come.
Break bread with us, and tell us your story.
Your food tempts me not.
As you wish, my little mermaid.
I am not your little mermaid!
I'm a Princess.
Princess?
Princess Antillia, the daughter of King Kronos.
And where, is this kingdom of yours, Princess?
In the great sea, beyond the Pillars of Hercules.
Pillars of Hercules!
There is nothing beyond.
The world ends there.
You doubt my word, fisherman?
Have you ever been, beyond them?
Had we, we wouldn't be here.
Do not touch me!
You smell of fish.
We should...
We are fishermen.
Now listen.
And listen well, Princess.
In our land, we have no Kings...
No Kings daughters, no slaves.
We are all free men.
Treating one another, as we would be treated ourselves.
My son and I, rescued you from the sea.
Deliver you to safety.
Our humble best you shared.
Yet we receive insults in return.
If our home is a hovel, our weave to coarse,
Our food tempts you not Royal Princess, bestow the honor of your presents on someone else.
You may help me now.
You may help yourself.
Come, Demetrius.
There are fish to be caught.
Good evening, Petros.
You're right, Antília?
Of course, why?
Your face, so pale you look sick.
Where is Demetrius?
Spreading the nets to dry.
I will help him.
She is sick.
Demetrius...
Now neither you nor I, have anything to hide.
Will you hand me my robe, or shall I come aboard as I am.
Why, you...
Beyond the sunset, is Atlantis my home.
A land of wonders beyond compare.
Take me to it, Demetrius.
My father will shower you with riches.
Antillia, all the riches I desire,
I already possess.
All save one.
The one you will never possess, fisherman.
Antillia.
Antillia!
Stand back!
- Sit down!
- Oh!
You must be mad.
There a law against stealing a boat.
I'm going home, and no law will hinder me.
Many men have tried.
Many good seamen have sailed into the sunset.
But none has ever returned, Antillia.
Not one!
- Are you afraid?
- Yes!
And rightly so, endless terrors, lurk beyond the great Pillars.
I would rather chance it and die, than live in your village another day.
Ah, forget this foolishness.
I will not let you go.
Very well, take me back.
There are other men, braver ones, who would beg for the privilege of doing my bidding.
Put me ashore, and watch me choose my traveling companion.
Listen, Antillia.
I will take you, but only on my terms.
Before the space of one moon,
I do not sight your land...
We will return to my land.
But wait that's not all.
And when we return...
You will become my beautiful wife, forever more.
As you say, Demetrius.
Antillia!
I can no longer tell east from west, north from south.
We must shore the sail and wait awhile.
No need for that.
This will guide us.
It points always to the north.
My father would call it sorcery.
It's not sorcery it's, science.
Demetrius.
It's time we ate.
No food.
Just some wine.
'Twas only a fish.
Let me fill it.
Shh!
These are cursed waters, we're turning back.
A dolphin moans, and my
Captain regrets his bargain.
It's not the bargain, it's not the dolphins, it's everything.
The fog, the silence when the wind goes.
It's voice, when it returns, whispering to me...
Turn about.
Turn about, or you'll never moor you're lonely ship.
Listen to my lips, Demetrius.
They too whispers.
But not of doom.
Tonight will bring the full moon, and there's still nothing ahead but sea.
I shall hold you to your promise?
I will keep it.
We turn back then?
Not yet.
Our bargain is for one moon...
...no more, no less.
Demetrius.
Yes?
Is the edge of the world at the Pillars of Hercules?
No.
And have you found unknown terrors, lurking behind every wave?
Well...
Well?
Well, I did see King Neptune.
But you did not truly see him.
Perhaps not.
Have I then earned your trust?
Forever.
Then believe me now, my love.
Before the full moon dies, you shall gaze upon Atlantis. I promise.
No, Demetrius.
We're not in danger.
We rejoice, Princess.
Our Gods are kind.
They bring you safely home.
With his help, Sonoy.
A guard, take him aboard.
- The name is Demetrius?
- It is.
- Fisherman?
- I can handle the net.
Could it be then, that you were born under the sign of Pisces?
- Sign?
- When were you born?
What stars control your destiny?
The stars are but for guiding seamen across the seas.
A man who speaks with a voice of a true seaman.
My name is Zaren.
This is Sonoy, who reads the stars.
With a ship like this, I would be the greatest fisherman in Greece.
You have no ships that sail under the sea?
Ah, Princess...
Your in time.
We're about to surface.
Why isn't my father here, to meet to me?
Didn't you send word to him?
The moment we discovered you.
But he is not well...
...he's waiting for you at the palace.
- Pull him off!
- Into the dungeon!
What is this?
Let go of me!
Let me go!
Let go!
Father.
Father?
- Oh.
- Antillia.
My child.
They told me you were ill.
Ill, I have been my dear with grief and worry.
Even though the stars foretold, you're safe return.
Did the star also foretell, that a stranger would return with me?
A stranger you say?
Yes father.
A wonderful stranger.
To whom will you give my hand in marriage.
But, but I had hoped that, you and Zaren...
I have never loved Zaren,
I never will.
But wait child.
We're forgetting the law.
For me, you will change it.
Don't worry my dear, It may take a little time.
Until then, it is best you not see each other.
But now...
Now I have a thousand questions.
Thank you.
Thank you for saving my life.
Your face...
I've not seen it before.
I'm Demetrius, the fisherman.
I'm Xandros, the sailor.
Xandros.
- From my homeland?
- Yes.
And the others?
All these strange men.
Where are they from?
From land I never knew existed.
Mostly seamen like you and I, blown off course, ship wrecked, washed a shore.
We sought sanctuary...
...but found instead, whips, and chains.
How long ago?
A lifetime of suffering ago.
One loses count, of time here.
I will not be here long enough to lose count.
Those were my very words, when I was first brought here.
To your feet!
There's work to be done.
Come...
Come.
Once they were men, young and strong like you.
But how could it be?
They are monsters.
How it is done, I do not know.
But in this fowl land, there are cruelties beyond belief.
Time and again, some of us are taken away without warning.
Where?
The house of fear.
Never seen again they are the beasts of burden.
Show him what to do!
Learn well and learn soon!
Or you'll feel the bite of this!
What is that?
The crystals born in the crater, capture the energy of the sun.
The little ones, are used for heat, and light.
The big one, could destroy the world.
- Fill it, I said!
- No, no, no, no, no...
One moment, your Highness.
Clear these slaves out of the way.
Into the ditch, all of you.
Get back, move along.
Forgive this your Highness, they'll have the filth, cleared from your path in a moment.
A gift, for the Princess.
You insolent slave!
Release that chain!
Your trusted Zaren, has lied to us.
He put the man who saved my life in chains.
I want him punished.
But was I, who gave the order to enslave the Greek.
You.
His Majesty, had no alternative.
By what right do you speak for your King.
What does he mean?
The law.
The law compels us to enslave foreigners.
And you my Princess, raised in the shadow of the throne, must certainly respect the law.
But what of my promises?
And what of your word, do they no longer mean anything?
But he is a foreigner, and all foreigners are dangerous.
Indeed Princess, I've consulted the stars, they do not favor him.
- You see my dear.
- In fact the Greek should have been put to death.
Yet I spared him.
Surely this is in no way to show gratitude, to the man who not only saved my life...
...but risked his very own.
Princess, you are unduly alarmed...
... He can always gain his freedom, through the ordeal of fire and water.
He wouldn't survive, you know it.
Father, please.
You enslaved him.
Free him now!
You have changed.
When I left, you were strong.
You were a King!
It's you, who have changed.
I wish I could help my child, I...
The law must be obeyed!
How dare you presume to speak for your King!
One would think you wear his crown!
In deed you do.
Oh, Azor!
Tears are of little use, Centurion.
What has Zaren, done to my father.
And what have I done to Demetrius.
I know, little one.
Come with me, your prayers are wasted here.
These Gods are false, with hearts of stone.
Azor...
Such talk is heresy.
It is the truth.
Come.
Up their my child, there dwells the one true God, who created all living things.
The true God is the moon?
No Antillia.
His hand, fashioned the moon...
And sent it spinning, through the galaxy’s of stars.
That same hand, molded the earth, with its high mountains, and deep seas.
He gave life to you, and to me.
Pray to him, Antillia.
He will listen to your prayers.
- The earth moved again last night.
- And gave us more work to do.
Remove his chains, he will come with me.
Wait here.
My orders are not to let him out of my sight.
Only nobles, may pass through these doors.
Well this Greek, is no noble.
Neither is he an Atlantean.
The Gods do not recognize the presence of barbarians, and he is one, is he not?
- Yes, but I...
- Do you argue with your Gods?
No, holy one.
Wait.
Wait, Demetrius.
Why?
You must listen to me.
I listened once, and awoke in chains.
Isn't that enough?
It wasn't my doing.
Zaren, told me you chose to return to Greece, and I believed him.
Till I saw you yesterday.
Then set me free, now.
I can't.
Why not?
Your father is the King, who will shower me with riches, remember?
He is not the same King I left here...
Zaren, has become the power in Atlantis.
Then ask Zaren.
He would have you killed, if he knew I loved you.
Subtitle created by,
Dandysubs and cryinoutloud.
Love...
You lured me to this miserable country, by lies and trickery.
You accepted my bargain, then made me believe you loved me, to keep from turning back.
And all the time, knowing I would soon be enslaved...
... is this love, Princess?
I thought my father was above the law.
You lie.
You do not think beyond your own selfish desires.
At first, true.
But when you took me in your arms...
...my heart was yours.
Your heart, comes dear Princess.
It is not worth the price I paid.
Give it to Zaren. Give him your love, and buy back my freedom.
Even your words, smell like fish.
Stay, Demetrius!
I prefer the company slaves.
Drink.
Drink.
Now, you will close your eyes.
When you are commanded to open them again, you will be a bull.
Every day, and every way, you will become more and more, like one.
Strong, strong, strong.
Take him away.
Now bring me the Greek.
And what shall you be?
Part mule, with long ridiculous ears?
Here?
Or a...
...a buffalo, with great horns.
Here, here?
But you, unlike the others...
...will be able to remember who you are.
Perhaps this would be appropriate.
Think how it would amuse the Princess, to see you as you really are.
A filthy pig.
Yes.
I have orders my Lord, Zaren.
He allows the Greek, a chance to gain his freedom.
Why do they always, take my best specimens, away from me.
But he must face the ordeal, of fire and water.
Alright.
Take him.
I will enjoy, seeing you slowly roasted alive.
What troubles you, Azor?
The doves, look at them.
In the past, they always circle the coliseum, and then return to their cages.
Now the whole flock is winging out toward the open sea.
Father it's Demetrius, you must stop this.
I will, my dear.
But Your Majesty, you can't disappoint your faithful subjects.
Of course.
I must not.
There's nothing we can do.
By his Majesty the King...
Demetrius, is a slave no more.
Here, in the middle of our vast ocean...
...is Atlantis, our mighty empire.
But no ocean is vast enough to contain our might, our power, our ambitions.
In the past, this one great crystal was enough to supply energy for all our needs.
But we cannot live in the past.
If we are to survive, we must live in the future.
And as a monument to the future, I have cause...
...to be readied another, a greater crystal in the belly of the crater.
A weapon so powerful, that with it, Governors of Atlantis, we can become, masters of the world.
You speak of wicked things, Zaren.
Do not listen to these words of war.
It's the destiny of Atlantis, to rule the world.
Do not the Gods themselves call us, the race of masters?
And isn't it also written, conquer or be conquered?
Conquered by whom?
I shall answer you.
One country alone, may not be an enemy worth fearing.
But united with other countries, could present...
...a strength that would endanger our very existence.
No!
Atlantis, can not take that chance.
We must attack them one by one.
Our only assurance of survival, is to attack and attack soon.
No. No. No.
Let Azor, be heard.
You have arms, that can repel any invasion.
Any imaginary invasion you can conceive.
More important, we have erred, in deliberately isolating Atlantis, from the rest of the world.
We should have shared, our advancements with all mankind.
The mankind you speak of, is good for one thing.
Slavery.
A country that depends upon slavery for its existence... must perish.
Your Majesty.
Noble Governors of Atlantis.
Long before he came, it was written in the stars...
...that a Greek fishermen would reach our shores.
That prophecy has been fulfilled.
It was also written, that with his arrival, the downfall of Atlantis would commence.
The fact, that a barbarian, was able to survive the ordeal of fire and water...
...is a warning nobleman, that we will be conquered by barbarians.
Unless we conquer first.
I call for war.
We of the mountains, say war.
And for the sea.
War for the rivers.
And for science.
And the animals.
War.
War.
You, priest?
Let it be war.
Empty?
Just as all the others.
The bees have deserted us.
Strange.
Each morning of my life,
I have awakened to the singing birds.
Now only silence, greets the day.
Perhaps it is instinct, call it what you will.
But they sense something, something evil.
A strange breeze now rises, with every outgoing tide...
Blowing dead leaves, out toward the open sea.
The humblest insects, seem to know it carries them...
...not to destruction... but to survival.
Even the seeds, forsake their mother soil.
All nature senses, that the end is near.
Man alone, turns deaf ears to natures warnings.
The Princess would speak to you, Demetrius.
I have no wish to speak to her.
It is best that you do.
I'm here to repay the debt I owe you.
Tonight at moon rise, the fishing fleet sets sail from the north harbor.
Be there.
One ship bears the Kings crest.
The captain will be waiting for you.
He will take you aboard, and set you ashore, at the Pillars of Hercules.
You must find your own way from their.
Antillia.
If you suspect treachery, set your mind at rest.
The words I spoke when last we met...
...they were words of anger.
Forgive me.
Thank you, Antillia.
You owe thanks to no one.
Your farewells, were said quickly.
She loves you.
I wish it were true.
I'm leaving.
Antillia, told me so in trust.
Do you want me to stay?
To remain in Atlantis, is to die.
None will be spared.
And doomsday is not far off.
But no one can foretell the future, not even a holy man.
I was not always a priest my son.
In the days when Atlantis, was a just, and noble land, I was well versed in sciences.
But I hid my eyes, when she began to use her great knowledge for evil.
And fashioned Gods, after her own scientific achievements.
For this, we will die.
The true God, will destroy Atlantis.
But why do you stay, Azor?
Because, guilt rests heavy on my heart.
We created wonders for the good of mankind.
Then turned them into monsters.
The crystals capture the rays of the sun, the base stores the energy.
They seem identical yet, vary greatly in function.
Now, this is a model, of the original invention.
It's purpose...
Provides warmth, and light, comfort.
Feel it.
Now see what they have done with it.
That urn...
Zaren, now builds one that has a thousand times more power.
Within a moon, it will be ready, and with it, he will subjugate the world.
Why are you telling me this?
You can warn the world, your own people, when you reach home.
But what defense, have we?
None.
And if I stay...
What can I do, to halt Zaren's, plan.
Nothing now, but tomorrow may bring a chance.
I can not wait til tomorrow, my ship leaves tonight.
Demetrius...
Dawn this seamen's garb, it will make your boarding easier.
Farewell, Azor.
God, shield you my son.
All my calculations, add up to the same conclusion.
On the next full moon, you must depart for conquest.
It'll give me little time, to finish the crystal.
It is the only date, the stars favor.
It'll be ready.
One man, Demetrius, wishes to see you my Lord.
 Let him enter.
You need my help.
Why would I need the help of a slave?
Forgive my stumbling tongue, a free man.
I'm also a fisherman, who knows the waters, and lands you do not know.
I can lead your ship safely, through the
Pillars of Hercules, into the hidden sea.
I can add color, to the darkness of your chart.
Why this change of heart?
Other slaves would rather face death, than give us guidance.
I have tasted luxury, and groomed an appetite for it.
Your friends in the dungeon, will call you a traitor.
Let them.
I can find comfort in, silver, and beaten gold.
Well?
Are we to bargain with the slaves?
He will bring us disaster.
You must excuse, our impetuous astrologer.
A bargain it is.
Proceed, Demetrius.
Let me see you change, the face of the world.
What do you think, map maker?
Well my Lord is aware, that none of our ships has ever returned, from the hidden sea.
They must have perished in the, treacherous reefs, or in the shifting currents, of the Pillars of Hercules.
We therefore possess virtually, no knowledge, only speculation.
The chance, favors this, being a trustworthy guide.
I'll wager, not one detail is correct.
We'll soon see.
Guard.
You, traitorous dog!
You traitor!
Remove him.
You stinking, filthy, traitor!
You filthy traitor! You swine!
You stinking traitor!
I'll take my pay now.
Of course, Demetrius.
This is only a sample, of my generosity,
I may have need of your services again.
I would never trust this Greek.
He lies with every breath
Dwell with your stars, Sonoy, and let matters of importance, rest in my hands.
I Trust men, who put wealth, above honor.
Another warning.
I measure the lava, every day.
It rises steadily.
A sea of boiling devastation, below Atlantis.
Straining at the throat of this sleeping volcano.
Waiting for the beginning of the end.
When is the end, Azor?
Soon after the next full moon.
Soon after Zaren, and his warriors, have set sail to, conquer the world.
But if Zaren, is delayed, this conquest can never take place.
My Lord Zaren, waits impatiently.
You should have been here before this.
Look.
Another delay.
There's little time left, and the slaves, grow lazier by the hour.
They can't help me.
You must help me.
What can you do?
Nothing.
But you, a man of wisdom, must surely know a way.
There is a limit to mans endurance.
These men have reached that limit.
They must rest!
Our Priest, has a splendid remedy.
Indeed.
I have an even better one.
Captain!
A score of them, to the gallows.
That will cure, the others.
The gallows, is not the answer, Zaren.
Listen to a man, that was once a slave.
What is your remedy?
Put me in charge here.
Then, what would you do?
Put up a camp near by, the dungeon is far away.
The slaves weary, before they begin their daily tasks.
Remove their chains, discard the whip, give them decent food.
Ridiculous, why should I grant such insane demands?
You have no choice.
Very well.
Of course, my services are not without a fee.
You have sampled my generosity.
You can rely upon it again.
But if you fail...
I will succeed.
I'm awake, Xandros.
The others are waiting.
They believe as I, that Demetrius, did not betray his friends.
We're all eager to help you with your plan.
I've been thinking.
Wishing I could do something to help you.
There's nothing you can do.
Nothing anyone can do.
It slowly eats its way, through the will, of the mind...
Till I'm no longer human.
In the end, I must be locked up, with the others.
Come, we must be on our way.
I want to help you, while I still can.
Remove the wedge.
Hurry, hurry!
- Set the bit deeper.
- Hurry, hurry!
- Volcano will wake!
- Hurry, hurry!
- Destroy the crystal.
- Hurry, hurry!
- Before the full moon.
- Hurry, hurry!
- Before Zaren, sees us.
- Hurry, hurry!
- Come up lava.
- Soon, soon!
- Crystal be damned.
- Damn, damn.
- Zaren, shall not conquer.
- No, no!.
Hurry, hurry!
Hurry, hurry, hurry...
I want to be your wife, Demetrius.
I love you.
Take me away.
I can't.
Your boat waits in the secret cove.
Let's leave Atlantis, and never return.
I have wronged you Demetrius, I know.
No that's not it Antillia, believe me.
What is it then?
I can't tell you.
Not yet.
Very well, leave me behind if you will.
But you must leave Atlantis, at once.
As soon as you finish your task,
Zaren, will kill you.
That's a chance I must take.
Please Princess, leave now, the sun will soon rise and he needs rest.
Trust me Antillia.
- Volcano will leak.
- Covering more, covering more.
- Come up lava.
- Covering more, covering more.
- Our days are numbered.
- Hurry more, hurry more.
- Destroy the crystal.
- Hurry more, hurry more.
- Before the full Moon.
- Hurry more, hurry...
- Come up lava.
- Now, now.
- Crystal be damned.
- Shh!
There, there!
No, this way.
Quick, cover the entrance!
They mustn't find the shaft.
There they are!
Go get them!
We'll, kill every last one of them!
- There!
- Don't let them get away.
Where is the Greek?
He can not be far.
Find him!
Free yourselves!
The end has come.
To the harbor!
Board the ships!
Insolent gravel!
Dare them, enter my palace.
Follow me!
No. No. No.
Antillia!
Antillia!
Antillia!
Antillia!
The water's rising, we are trapped!
No escape there, the harbor is sealed, it's flooded with the lava!
Here, this way!
Damn you.
Atlantis is gone.
But free men, wiser men...
...carried the culture, from the mother empire...
...to the four corners, of the earth.

NARRATOR: Can death be outwitted?
Is the secret to of eternal life just around that corner?
Today medical science batches up mutilated bodies,
Transplanting human skin, eyes, limbs, even vital organs.
Is the next step the transplantation
Of the human brain?
Many scientists answer yes, but they pause and add
A grim warning, for in the ancient folk legends tales are
Told of blood sucking vampires, crawling out of graves
To live on the bodies of helpless victims.
Is man now doomed to produce a race of ever living
Monstrosities, worse than the vampires of legend?
Will ruthless men and women of great wealth and power,
Greedily buy or steal the bodies of the young and beautiful
So their brains may live on forever.
Such questions may seem fanciful,
But at this very moment, scientists
Are working on the answer to brain transplantation
And human bodies are used.
This girl was buried in a nearby cemetery yesterday.
Only a few hours ago her body was stolen by Dr. Otto Frank
And brought to this hidden laboratory.
He has grafted a living animal's grain
Into this newly dead body.
If the experiment works, the next step
Will be the transplantation of a human brain.
The brain cells are being reactivated
By an atomic fission produced the cyclotron.
Has he found a way to outwit death
Or has he created another...
[DRAMATIC MUSIC] Deep below,
Dr. Frank takes the chance of smashing
His way into a new sealed vault.
His experiments cannot continue without another body.
The watchman's mind was not on body
Snatchers, just his usual nip.
[SCREAM] Inside the vault a body waits.
This is one of the doctor's mistakes,
A monstrosity, an animal's brain grated to a human body.
Leaving the dead watchmen, the monstrosity
Carried the girl's body out of the vault.
It fears and obeys one master, Dr. Frank.
Here beneath the old mention, the doctor carefully
Prepared for another transplant.
This body had been in the vault for only a few hours.
Chances seemed better this time.
Still Dr. Frank was doubtful.
Tissue and dead bodies deteriorates rapidly.
Where were the live fresh bodies he had been promised.
He bitterly resents that every step forward
Depends on the whim of the minds of a woman
Brooding upstairs in her bedroom.
And Hetty March wonders has she been a fool squandering
Money on this strange experiment?
Money hoarded through a long, greedy lifetime, each day more
Money, each day death getting closer.
Ah, but to starts life again in a brand
New body, beautiful and young.
No price can be too high for that.
Can she really trust the doctor?
Can she really trust anyone?
Hasn't everyone tried to cheat her?
Wanting her money while they smile at her ugliness,
But they never got a penny.
Oh, how she made them sweat.
Especially this old fool, companion and gigolo.
How many years she's kept him dangling on promises.
While sometimes it's convenient to
Have him there, especially when he comes cheaper than servants.
The Austrian girl.
Nina Rhodes, 18, no family, pleasing personality... whatever
That might mean...
Thick ankles, pimply
Face, but she always when she's spoken to very likely.
Well, applications forms for a servant girl
Don't usually include bust, waist and hip measurements.
[RADIO ANNOUNCEMENT IN
BACKGROUND]
All three will be here tomorrow.
And then you can choose.
REPORTER (OVER RADIO):
Earlier this evening
At Greenhaven Cemetery, the body snatchers brutally murdered
Nightwatchman Robert Pain,
62, who evidently interrupted
His killers during their ghoulish tasks.
His neck was broken.
The imprint of a huge pair of hands was found on his throat.
It's the opinion of the police that the same gang
That has previously...
Ring for Dr. Frank. [BUZZER]
So that's what he was doing.
[MECHANICAL WHIRRING]
More of this hocus pocus, Hetty.
The doctor transplanted a brain from a live dog
To a live human body.
You saw the walk out of the cylinder alive.
How many failures since thin?
Still, it's your money.
The bodies must be fresh.
This specimen is excellent.
An the police are looking for the body snatcher.
Find a local cemetery doctor, are you
Trying to blaze a trail to our door?
The final test was essential for your protection.
As for the police if they come here, I hit the switch.
A nuclear reaction is set off.
And as a matter of minutes, this house and any evidence
It might contain becomes a radioactive hole in the grade.
Be careful.
We can wait for that until after your operation.
Nothing must go wrong.
There's no sign of live.
Watch.
She lacks but one thing, a brain.
Hans was still living when we dragged him from the car.
That's why we succeeded with the transplant.
She seems alive.
She is to a limited extent.
She'll be able to move around, but the brain deteriorization
Is too extensive with thought processes.
Pardon me, but how far is Hollywood from here?
All right, let's see.
16 kilometers, about 10 miles.
Which way?
That way.
Are you going to Hollywood?
No such luck.
I'm what's known as a foreign domestic.
The next 12 months,
I'll be scrubbing
Floors and making beds.
But when my time's up,
Hollywood look out.
That's strange.
A foreign domestic agency has paid my passage too.
I'm from Vienna, Austria.
Oh, really?
I'm from England.
No.
Is this your first trip?
Yes, I'm awfully excited.
Por favor, I no speak
English very good.
Are you going to work for Mrs. March too?
This sounds like a sister act.
You too?
Nina Rhodes?
Yes, sir.
Anita Gonzales?
Beatrice Mullins?
That's right.
Are you Mr. March?
No, I work for Mrs. March.
Come along.
NARRATOR: Three new bodies, fresh, live, young bodies.
No families and friends within thousands of miles,
No one to ask embarrassing questions when they disappear.
Victor wondered which
Mrs. March would pick,
The little Mexican, the girl from Vienna,
Or the buxom blonde.
Victor knew his favorite, but he still felt uneasy.
Making to an 80-year-old woman in the body
Of a 20-year-old girl is insanity.
Still, Hetty's plan to transfer her fortune to the new body
Had been brilliant.
Unpleasant to think about what's going to happen to these girls,
But a man has to consider his own future.
What would happen to him if Hetty
Were to cast him off after all these years.
VICTOR: Well, there's your new home, girls.
BEATRICE: Gives me the shivers.
Aren't there any neighbors?
No.
Are there any other servants?
No, but I don't think you're going to find it boring.
What a jolly little place this is.
[SCREAMS]
What was that?
No one's to leave this house without permission.
Hurry along.
Hurry up.
No go.
Put down your luggage.
Turn around slowly.
Get the doctor.
Get the doctor.
NARRATOR: As with the other bodies stolen from cemeteries,
The nerve endings of the brain were too far
Gone to receive a proper transplant.
The experiment had failed to produce anything more than a
Walking breathing zombie-like creature.
But the doctor permitted to wander about the laboratory.
She was quite harmless and at times even amusing.
Charming, isn't she?
Did you want something?
Mrs. March is waiting for you.
The girls have arrive.
She doesn't have a brain.
May be advantages.
I want them examined immediately.
Very well, this way.
Victor, the doctor can conduct the examination perfectly.
What an old spoil sport I am.
Have you disconnected the phone?
Can't I depend on you for anything?
Won't it be midnight when those girls start calling police,
Employment agencies, immigration authorities, consulates.
There will be no phone calls.
Hideous, she's useless.
There is one more test I should make.
Do anything you what with her.
The other two?
Perfect medical specimens.
All right, Anita, get dress now and wait for the others.
Mrs. March, I am now giving you notice.
I do not care to work in this house any longer.
I demand that...
You have signed an agreement.
If you have any objection, you will discuss them
With the immigration authorities as provided for in your papers.
But Mrs. March...
Later.
Stand up, my dear.
BEATRICE: I've got the same measurements as Marilyn Monroe.
Ahem, the lucky girl?
Yeah.
Allow me to be the first to offer
Congratulations to both of you.
For me?
Come on.
Come on.
Your room is in the basement, Anita.
Nina, your room is upstairs, right
Across from the top of the stairs.
I'll have to show you.
ANITA: I think it will be lonesome down there.
VICTOR: Nonsense, you will be all right.
Gracias.
Thank you.
[BEEPS AND WHIRRING]
Quien es?
Who is it?
[SCREAMS]
Bea, are you sure she's not in her room?
Yes.
Victor left a little while ago.
Maybe she went with him.
She didn't get out of this prison
Without permission, that's for sure.
But she would have said good-bye.
Why should she?
We only met her yesterday.
I don't blame her for not wanting
To sleep in the basement.
It's funny though.
Mrs. March wouldn't even listen when I asked to be dismissed.
This house gives me the creeps.
She doesn't even have any uniforms for us.
What in the world do you think you're doing?
You told us last night to clean and polish in here.
Look at your hands.
That will a stain o them.
No don't argue.
Go and wash them immediately.
You can put the things away after Nina cleans them.
Mrs. March, where is Anita?
Anita?
Oh, she left last night.
I would like to give notice too.
I will discuss it with you another time.
[BEEPS, WHIRRING AND BUBBLING]
Nina?
Nina?
Come here this instant.
Yes, Mrs. March.
Your name isn't Nina.
But Mrs. March she's got polish all over her hand
And I'm not doing anything.
I don't want you running up and down stairs.
Those pretty legs of yours will get ugly muscles.
Send Nina to me.
Yes, ma'am.
MRS. MARCH: I'll be in my room.
Bea, come with me.
I want to show you something.
Anita wouldn't leave without taking her clothes.
I think we better get out of here, fast.
Bea, I'd hate to leave if she's still here.
You'll go now if you go with me.
This hinge is loose.
Help me.
[BEEPING]
NARRATOR: One last experiment before Dr.
Frank would be ready.
But this was the most critical of all the experiments.
For the first time, the grafting operation
Would be performed on a living human body,
And the brain would come from the doctor's favorite cat.
Anita was ready.
[KNOCK AT DOOR]
It's me, Nina.
What about your clothes?
Never mind, let's go.
Bea, she almost saw us.
Let's wait awhile to make sure we won't run into her.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Bea.
Bea?
[THUNDER-LIKE SOUNDS] Bea?
Bea?
Where are you?
Answer me.
Wait.
I'm here Mrs. March.
She's locked us in.
Open it.
I said, open it.
Mrs. March.
Victor.
Victor.
Well, you took long enough.
The lawyer will see you in the morning.
I told him you we're going to change your will.
You'll have to check the basement door, it came loose.
You failed.
[MEOW] She thinks she's a cat.
Nice kitty.
[CAT GROWLING] Well, I see still resent the way
Mrs. March treats you.
I can't say that I blame you.
Kitty has always been very fond of me.
Haven't you?
Does she have all the instincts of a cat?
Watch.
[GROWLING]
She ate it.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Bea, is that Anita?
Where?
Oh, I don't think so.
Look out!
Somebody help her.
[GROWLING]
Back, Hans, back.
Hans, Hans.
I still think you should have locked them up.
They're not about to leave this house
After what they've witnessed.
They know Hans is outside there.
Even if we could get past that creature outside,
There's still the electric fence.
The phone's dead.
We can't get help that way.
If we could get the car...
That's it.
Victor.
Victor?
He likes me.
I guess.
If you could get the keys from him...
Bea, I was having a little night cap.
Who do you think you are pinching me?
Maybe you like some company?
Someone like me?
That's more like it.
Don't you like me, Victor?
Wait.
Hans, is chained.
Let's go outside.
Outside?
I think I'd like that.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
MRS. MARCH: Victor?
Victor?
[HISSING]
Anita?
What are you doing up there?
Anita, what's the matter with you?
Don't you know me?
Anita, listen to me...
[HISSING]
[GRUNTING AND GROWLING]
Anita?
Stay right there.
Don't move.
I'm coming.
[HISSING] Anita.
Anita, let me help you.
Anita, wait.
Take my hand.
Anita.
Anita!
[SCREAMS] Astonishingly complex, isn't it?
The human eye.
NINA: Dr. Crane?
Bea?
She's unconscious, but she'll live.
No.
She will live.
But Anita won't.
She's dead.
Nina, dear, come along with us now.
You've had a bad shock.
Get out of here, both of you.
I'm staying with Bea.
Why don't you do something for her?
I've done what I can for now.
Later, an operation might be possible.
I'm preserving the eye.
Let me show you.
Come over here.
The cellular structure is being kept alive
By these electrical vibrations.
I use the same principal in keeping that hand alive.
Bea is a very lucky girl.
You think that ironically?
Let me explain.
I'm the only man alive today capable
Of restoring your friend's sight.
Dr. Alexis Carrel, who pioneered the transplanting
Of vital human organs, kept a portion
Of an animal's heart alive for many years.
For this he received the Nobel Prize.
And I, who have so far surpassed his efforts...
Surely you don't want to compare
Yourself with Dr. Carrel.
He was humane.
I, too, fight to preserve life and to find the means
To improve the lives of future generations.
Your viewpoint is that narrow ignorant one,
Held by the Medical
Society today,
Which forces me to work in a place like this,
To give in to the whims of a foolish old woman,
Because she can supply me with the funds I
Need to continue my work.
[MOANING]
You're going to be all right.
Nina?
Yes, Bea.
I... I can't see.
Why...
Your eyes are bandaged.
Something happened.
Don't think about it now.
Listen to me, Bea.
Are you listening?
This is important.
Yes.
We must be ready when the chance comes.
I remember now.
It was Anita.
She... Oh, my eye.
My eye.
[SOBBING]
You better leave.
Give this a chance to take effect.
I'm a doctor.
I'll take care of her.
Make sure you'll take excellent care of her,
Until your plans call for something else.
Or am I to be the next one, doctor?
There.
Got all the clothes?
Yes.
And made my hair appointment?
I took care of everything on your list
While you were talking with the lawyer.
Hair appointment,
Monday, 10:00 AM, Charles
At the Ritz under Nina's name.
I'll want Nina to model these later after I've rested.
You tell her.
They're back.
I will have to leave you now.
Remember, I'm going to try to get us out here tonight.
No.
Forget about me.
I won't go.
Bea, don't talk like that.
NARRATOR: Mrs. March had not realized her new body had such
A satisfactory shape, perhaps not as spectacular
As the English girl, but in excellent taste.
She couldn't help being amused.
The stupid girl was not only modeling Mrs. March's
Future wardrobe but Mrs.
March's future body.
So firm, so nicely rounded in places men like.
You might have knocked when you came in.
I'm sorry, don't stop your style show on my account.
Does my aged look disturb you?
Hetty, that's unkind.
You see it's hard for a vain, stupid man
To realize that he holds no attraction
For a lovely young girl.
You're not needed now, Victor.
Close the door quietly when you go out.
I'm not going to be needed at all.
That's what you're saying, isn't it?
After tomorrow, when...
Victor!
That's enough Get out.
That's the way it's going to be when what?
Don't ask tiresome questions.
That will be enough for tonight.
I want us both to get some rest.
Try to sleep.
But Mrs. March...
That's an order.
Do as I say.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
You aren't looking for me, are you?
Why would a pretty, young girl want to be around an old man?
What did you try to tell Mrs. March?
So that's what you planned to do.
Get rid of old Victor once you get all that money.
The only thing is, of course, is won't really be you.
Victor, please tell me.
Try to make sense.
I am telling you.
Tomorrow, you'll be one of the richest women in the world.
Here's a press release.
It's in the mails now.
All the major news syndicates.
Orphan girl is sole heir to March millions.
Nina Rhodes has a lucky star.
I don't understand.
The next press release will be March
Mansion destroyed by fire.
Cinderella girl Nina
Rhodes, sole survivor.
Only it won't be you.
It's a pity too.
You're nice the way you are.
Please don't let it happen.
You could help me and Bea get away.
When you're a rich woman, you wouldn't forget an old friend,
A friend who saved your life, would you?
Get out in the car.
And stay there.
Victor, Bea too.
Bea must come too.
One minute.
Just to make sure.
Sign this.
Hurry.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[CYMBALS CRASHING]
Bea, you've got to come with...
No, I won't go.
Why should I want to go on living like this?
I'll get Victor to help me.
And we will carry you.
[SCREAMS]
Did you want something from Victor, dear?
Sit down, my dear.
I'm afraid you're wearing yourself out with all this
Rushing around I don't like that.
You realize she's mad, don't you, Dr. Frank?
Relax.
Hurry, doctor.
I'll be ready for you shortly, Mrs. March.
MRS. MARCH: I'll be waiting.
It's finally about to happen
You don't know what it's been
Like for me, living with this ugly body of mine.
Knowing that any attention I received
Was not for me but my money.
Well, nobody got any of it.
I've never known what it is like to be loved for myself alone.
Why did you kill
Victor, Mrs. March?
Victor?
Victor was a fool.
I'm a practical woman, Dr.
Frank, a business woman.
I've never been a very practical person.
I suppose that makes me a fool too in your eyes.
Of course not.
Relax, Mrs. March, just relax.
[ZAPPING SOUND]
Waking up are you?
Good, I want to talk to you.
You singed a paper making
Victor your legal guardian.
That's right, isn't it.
I did sign something, didn't I?
That would probably work as well for me.
We could stay here.
None of this would have to be destroyed.
Feeling better aren't you?
Try it on your own.
I want to know if Mrs.
March didn't intend blowing
Me up with all the rest of this.
You're a very wealthy woman now, Nina.
But I what I must decide is how to keep you
And your funds available with the least amount of nuisance
To myself.
I could keep you under sedation until your signature is
Required or I could replace your brain with one more amenable.
What about Mrs. March, doctor?
Mrs. March no longer has a thing to say.
Do you, my dear?
Completely recovered I'd say.
How do you feel.
[HISSING] I guess
A transplant would be better.
It won't hurt.
NARRATOR: Dr. Frank had enjoy this transplantation.
Mrs. March's brain ending up in the body of a cat.
Poetic justice to think of autocratic Mrs. March
Scavenging in back alley garbage cans for her dinner.
But Mrs. March doesn't take things lying down.
[ELECTRIC WHIRRING]
[MUSIC PLAYING] Mrs.
March did not intend to let their money get out of sight.
She would follow that girl.
Some time, some place, revenge would come.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Good morning.
Would you get me Maj. Bernard at his Whitehall number?
Thank you.
Hello. Thank you.
Alan? It's Gordon.
Look, you're coming down here today, aren't you?
Could you pick up a book for me and bring it with you? It's...
Gordon?
Operator.
Blast.
It got cut off. That was my brother-in-law.
Would you try again? I have got to change.
Yes, sir.
Operator, we've been cut off from Midwich 25.
Would you get it again, please?
Hello, will you replace
your receiver, please?
Please replace your receiver.
- For more than an hour, you're saying.
- Yes, sir.
Perhaps something went wrong with his phone.
This is what puzzles me.
I have also tried the vicar, the general stores, and the post office.
I can't get any reply from any of them.
Country telephone exchanges being what they are.
Yes, I know, sir, but look here.
Midwich is here.
Now 4th Brigade are running that exercise of theirs all round there.
I don't think there's anything in it, but I was wondering... as I was going down for the weekend... whether I could have your permission to leave a little earlier.
All right, Alan.
- Give me a ring later. I'll be here till 5:00.
- Thank you, sir.
- Alan.
- Yes, sir?
Have a nice weekend.
Give my respects to Gordon.
I will. Goodbye, sir.
- Hello, Gobby.
- It's Maj. Bernard.
What's happened to the telephones?
I've been trying to get through.
It's funny you should ask, Major.
I've been sent to look for the bus which hasn't turned up.
We can't get through by phone either.
Here's your bus, Gobby.
Struth.
Better have a look.
All right, Alan, get hold of the local Area Commander.
- What's his name?
- Ward Johnson, sir.
Tell him to call me if he wants authorization.
I'll get things moving this end.
Make sure the newspapers don't get hold of this for the time being.
If anything has got out of hand there, we don't want any panic.
Report back as soon as you have any results.
Right, sir.
Get me South Eastern Command, please.
Over here, Sergeant.
Look, the canary.
- You needn't go in if you don't want to.
- I'll have a go, sir.
- Quite sure?
- Sir.
- What on earth's happening...
- Just a minute.
Hello, Doctor, I'm glad you're here.
We may need you.
- What's wrong with him?
- That's what we're trying to find out.
- Will you take a look at him, Doc?
- Take off the respirator.
Pulse is normal.
Seems to be breathing normally.
I think he's just fainted.
He's coming round.
You better let me know what this is all about.
- When were you last in the village?
- Midwich?
I left at about 10:00.
Had a couple of patients to see in Widmarsh.
Now there are road blocks all over the place.
I've got to get back.
I've got patients to see.
My hunch is that all your patients in Midwich... are in the same state as this man.
All right, old chap. Take it easy.
What can it be?
To put a man out like a light, penetrate our respirators, do all this.
- Some sort of gas?
- No, it can't be.
Any breeze would have blown it about a bit.
The edges of the area are as well-defined as that hedge there.
Cold.
- What did you say?
- Ice-cold.
I'm all right, sir, only cold.
My hands are like ice.
Midwich to Charlie Alpha.
Can you see anything? Over.
Everything looks all right from here. Over.
Let me speak to him.
Hello, Charlie Alpha.
This is Maj. Bernard speaking.
Can you see nothing unusual at all in Midwich? Nothing moving?
No, sir, nothing.
Matter of fact, that's odd.
Nothing is moving down there.
I can see some people, but they're not moving either.
They're lying on the ground.
- As though they've fallen?
- Yes, sir.
Right.
Take it down slowly, but pull up the minute you feel anything.
Feel anything, sir?
- Anything unusual.
- Roger.
Still nothing moving, sir. Taking her down.
Careful now.
Easy.
Another aircraft approaching.
Send out a general warning now.
All aircraft to avoid this area and not to drop below 5,000 feet.
Yes, sir.
Midwich to base. Emergency.
I say again, emergency.
Warn all aircraft to avoid area,
5-mile radius.
Latitude 51 degrees, 10 minutes,
30 seconds north.
Longitude 1 degree, 11 minutes,
20 seconds west.
Maintain minimum altitude of 5,000 feet. Out.
Blimey! Look!
Darling, I'm sorry. I must have dozed off.
Look at the time. It's almost 3:00.
Why didn't you call me?
I'd better go and see about lunch.
Anthea.
I found myself asleep on the floor.
What an extraordinary thing to do.
I'm cold.
The fire's gone out.
Did you...
Did we faint?
Must have blacked out.
Why?
My hands are quite numb.
What did happen?
I don't know.
You're all right.
- You're late.
- I couldn't get through.
Get through?
What did you mean you're all right?
How did you know?
It's extraordinary, but we blacked out for several hours.
- I know.
- It must have been a gas leak.
It was not only you two.
The whole village fell asleep.
All of Midwich was cut off from the outside world for several hours.
- Anything registering?
- No, sir, nothing unusual.
Keep at it.
- Mr. Zellaby.
- Yes, Miss Ogle?
Are these people from the telephone company?
- Not the telephone company.
- That's what I said.
If they want to pull the wool over our eyes... they ought to try something better.
- I'm trying to find out...
- After all, we're not stupid, are we?
What's happened isn't natural.
Tell you what we'll do.
I'll press for an official explanation... while you help to stop the rumors getting about. All right?
Do you mind?
- Soil samples?
- Yes, sir.
- Plant life?
- Even the bark on the trees.
Don't forget insects, grasses, water, metals.
The sooner and more elaborate these tests can be made, the better.
It's okay. This is Professor Gordon Zellaby.
Yes, sir.
No one seems to have come to any harm.
A few cuts and bruises where they fell.
Lucky no one was in their bath.
They might have been drowned.
Hello, Mrs. Harrington.
The least they can do is offer us some kind of compensation.
- But you feel all right?
- No thanks to them if I do.
And a large burn in my best dress into the bargain.
What the wife means is... you don't hardly expect to drop asleep before dinner, do you?
We've established that whatever it was, was static, odorless, invisible.
It didn't register on radar.
It was non-metallic.
It showed nothing on our Geiger counters.
You have got the reports there.
There are no signs of physical, biological, or psychological changes.
That's practically meaningless.
For instance, serious exposure to x-rays or gamma rays... need not have an immediate effect.
But these people have to be kept under observation.
- And yourself.
- And my household.
It would be a bit tricky to put you all in a sanatorium.
My instructions are to keep the whole incident out of the limelight.
- National security?
- Lf you like.
Until we know the cause, we shan't know what to expect.
Since you are there, suppose you keep an eye on Midwich for us?
If you find anything, let us know through Alan.
There's no need for direct contact between us.
More security? Ever cautious.
It gets under the skin, you know.
- Anything else today, Mrs. Zellaby?
- No, that's all, thank you.
I'll have to get in a new supply of pickles if you go on like this.
I do seem to be getting through a lot these days, don't I?
That'll be £17.6.
- Shall I add it to the account?
- Yes, thank you.
How's the Professor?
He's very well. Very well indeed.
Good morning.
- Miss Ogle, dear.
- Yes?
I think there's going to be news up at Kyle Manor.
News? What kind of news?
Hello.
I said, hello.
- How long have you been here?
- Ages.
Liar.
I have just discovered a fascinating thing.
Here are the plant samples from that day.
This one for example.
Perfectly ordinary pelargonium zonale.
What's happening is exactly what you'd expect if I made a 50% graft...
Why did you kiss me like that?
Come on, what's the secret?
Something's afoot. Why are you so happy?
Now, Gordon, I want you to sit down.
Keep quite calm.
There's nothing to worry about.
Now.
We have apparently succeeded... in crossing a Zellaby Gordonius with a Zellaby Antheum.
Just what the results will be, we shan't know for some time yet.
I think you should sit down.
- Can I get you some tea?
- No.
A drink? No, that wouldn't be right.
Feet up?
- Something to eat?
- Yes, please.
What?
Cheese, pickles, and half a dozen anchovies.
Recently my favorite diet.
Hadn't you noticed?
Mrs. Plumpton at the shop has.
I have been too engrossed in my work, but we'll change all that.
Thank you, darling.
You've made my happiness complete.
But all the more so because I am old enough to appreciate it.
Now then, what was it you wanted?
Cheese, pickles... and half a dozen anchovies.
I'm afraid there's no doubt about it.
Milly...
I wish there was something I could say to comfort you...
'cause I know what you'll have to put up with... from some of the people in the village over this.
But you can count on me to do anything
I can to help you and your child.
Do you think I'd...
Do you think I could...
Milly, I told you, there's no doubt about it.
Now if there's anyone you want me to talk to about this.
But I've never...
It's impossible.
This is some present, Jim. Thanks a lot.
Where did you say you got it? Tokyo?
It's a real beauty.
You can take action pictures in this light.
Jan, look at me.
When I learn to use this properly,
I might go into the photo business.
Jan, turn this way. That's right.
I want to see how...
What's the matter with you?
Jim comes back after a whole year... and you look as if you were going to a funeral.
An attempted suicide.
Janet Pawle, whose husband only came back from sea yesterday.
- It's dreadful.
- Three other women in the village... half out of their minds.
Milly Hughes, Rose Shepherd,
Mary Burnett.
- Please don't go on.
- That's why we're asking you to tell us.
Please don't keep on.
Don't you see what you're asking me is not right ethically?
For heaven's sake, Vicar.
How do you think I feel?
I married late in life.
When my wife told me that she was going to have a baby... it was the happiest moment
I've ever known.
Don't talk to me about ethics.
Don't you see that this is something which concerns all of us... that this is the one moment when it is your duty to break confidence.
Very well.
Four of them have been to see me.
One of them is only 17.
- Evelyn Harrington?
- Yes.
She was terribly frightened, and frankly, so am I.
I know these girls.
I watched them grow up.
When they tell me they've no way of accounting for their condition...
I am compelled to believe them.
That means every woman in this village... who is capable of childbirth is going to have a baby.
I can't believe it.
This is not a matter of belief, Vicar.
It's a matter of fact.
And there's something else.
All this seems to date from that day two months ago... when Midwich was cut off from the rest of the world.
Who's next?
This is Anthea Zellaby's, Doctor.
Let's have a look at it.
It's one of the most perfectly formed embryos I've ever seen.
Yes, but is it normal?
It's more than normal.
It's a 7-month embryo after only 5 months.
It's all right. I've seen the x-rays, and it's a fine specimen.
Dr. Willers says it's perfect, absolutely normal.
That should make us very happy.
It's going to be all right.
Is it? Is that what you believe?
You're tired, darling.
That's right. I'm tired.
And do you know why?
Because every night I lie awake and worry.
Now you don't have to worry anymore.
You don't really believe that.
- Dr. Willers says...
- I don't care what Dr. Willers says.
All right, so it's not a monster.
It's a perfect specimen.
- But what does that tell me?
- You're going to have a baby.
Whose baby? Yours?
Does it tell me what kind of life is growing inside me?
What sort of brain it has?
Where it comes from?
Does it tell me that?
Where does it come from?
Stop it!
You must stop it.
We've got to be rational about this.
We may not be any better off than any of the others... but there is absolutely nothing we can do but wait.
Maybe it's ours, maybe it isn't.
If it's ours, we shall know it. If it isn't...
I'm afraid.
I'm so afraid.
I hope that none of them lives.
What a ridiculous way to behave.
We're still terribly busy, but Doctor said to tell you... that Mrs. Zellaby's fine.
- And the baby?
- Perfect.
- In every respect?
- Hello, Gordon.
- Got a cigarette?
- How about the baby?
Splendid. Unusually heavy, though.
10 pounds, 8 ounces.
Strange eyes.
All right. You can go in now.
- Got a cigarette?
- Yes, of course.
How many others have been delivered so far tonight?
Anthea's my third.
What about their weight?
All slightly over 10 pounds.
All have got these strange eyes.
All that worrying. And now...
Gordon, have you seen him?
He's such a beautiful baby.
I do love you so.
He's probably jealous.
Now be quiet, Bruno.
Lie down and behave yourself.
Handsome, isn't he?
Take a look at this, Doctor.
It's a section of hair.
Yes, it's flat on one side, on the other an arc.
Somewhat in the shape of a narrow capital "D."
It belongs to my son, David.
Have you ever seen such a hair type before?
- Have you noticed their nails?
- Yes, they're narrower than ours.
Covering less of the upper surface of the digit, but as flat as normal nails.
- What did the blood test show?
- It's too early to tell.
The blood circulating at present is still that of the mother's group.
So they're apparently normal children with these exceptions:
Strange eyes, arresting, I would say... an unknown hair group, and unusual finger nails.
Whatever they are, their physical development is absolutely startling.
In point of time, they're four months old... but their development and capabilities is that of 18 months.
No, please, stop it.
Won't stop.
She won't stop!
What happened?
I was giving David his bottle.
I must have forgotten to test it.
It was too hot for him.
He spat it out.
He just seemed to glare at her.
Get my bag from the car.
Is that any reason to scald yourself?
This box is a product of Oriental ingenuity.
There are no visible means of opening it... but if you do just what I've shown you, it comes open.
Now see if you can do it.
That goes down.
Now you've got it.
Splendid.
It shows I was right to marry your sister.
Your family has brains.
Let's see if I can do this myself.
There you go.
Now watch this.
And remember that he's only 1 year old.
Go on, open it, David.
Yes, there's something inside.
It's a chocolate.
Come along, it's time for your bath.
- This is fantastic.
- You think so?
Come with me.
It's all right, it's only a box with a chocolate in it.
I don't know, sir.
I never allow her to have chocolates.
It's quite harmless.
I just gave some to David.
But you didn't even show her how to do it.
That's exactly my point. I didn't have to.
If you demonstrate something to one of them, they all know it.
Now watch.
- I want that.
- Keith, give it back to him. At once!
No, Nancy, leave them alone.
Ted Brower! Come inside this moment!
I've told you about playing with those children before.
Where's my Philip?
You're always all together.
It's his turn to study. He's at your home.
It's his home, too.
You are anxious for us to leave, aren't you?
You have the same every week:
12 jars, 15 shillings.
You wish we wouldn't come here anymore, Mrs. Plumpton.
- I never said.
- It's what you're thinking.
You've nothing to fear from us.
However, in future, someone else will come for our order.
Goodbye, Mrs. Plumpton.
Good afternoon, Miss Ogle.
You ready, Gordon?
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.
Gordon, don't you think Anthea should know about this conference... what's being discussed?
There's no reason to alarm her just because you are alarmed.
I haven't got your cold scientific detachment.
People, especially children, aren't measured by their IQ.
What's important about them is whether they're good or bad.
And these children are bad to everyone but you.
But they are children.
Children are not born with a sense of moral values. They have to be taught.
- With their intellect that should be simple.
- Intellect. That's all you care about.
What if you can't teach them?
What if you can't put the brake of morals on them?
First we must try.
You're blinded by this vision of intellect.
You see David as an Einstein.
Potentially greater.
Solving the riddle of the universe.
Your son, David.
Anthea's son.
I have no proof that he's mine.
Where has Father gone?
To London.
You must hurry, David.
Why?
You'll be late.
No, I meant why has he gone to London?
He has some business there.
- What sort of business?
- A conference.
Don't you like me to help you, David?
Thank you. But I'm old enough to do things for myself.
Father agrees with that.
Darling, your finger.
Let me do that.
It doesn't hurt. Please don't fuss.
It might turn septic.
There.
You said I must hurry.
Goodbye, Mother.
Goodbye, David.
And, gentlemen, as the Home Secretary has permitted this disclosure...
I can now inform you that Midwich... is not the only colony of such children.
Here in a township of Northern Australia...
30 infants were born in one day.
But apparently, something went wrong.
All the children died within 10 hours of birth.
In an Eskimo community, there were 10 births.
The community didn't take kindly to this.
Golden-haired babies born of black-haired mothers violated the taboos.
None survived.
In the communist world... there were two time-outs similar to the one at Midwich.
One at Irkutsk, here on the borders of Outer Mongolia.
A grim affair.
The men killed the children.
And their mothers.
The second, in the mountains of the Northwest.
All the children survived.
Our reports, though limited... indicate that they are receiving education on the highest level.
All these time-outs happened on the same day as the one at Midwich.
This is now three years ago.
Have we established anything about the origins of these children?
There is very little to go on.
Zellaby, you must have some theory.
May I suggest that he may be somewhat too intimately involved?
My position as a dubious father is influencing my scientific detachment.
- Is that what you think?
- I have reason to believe so.
Well, let's hear what the others have to say.
Dr. Carlisle?
I went into the question of mutation.
Once in a great many 1,000 years, an abrupt jump may take place... in animal or in vegetable life.
A new variation suddenly occurs for no apparent reason.
Would that explain, why entire groups of people were... cut off for periods of several hours?
No, sir. It would not.
Very well. Any other line of thought?
Yes. There is the possibility of the transmission of energy.
May I put it this way:
Already, we can direct radar beams out into space with the utmost accuracy.
Electrical impulses have been bounced off the moon.
And we are continually receiving impulses from other planets and stars.
And impulses are energy and matter.
We're aware of that, Professor Smith.
But where does it take us?
The Professor and I think alike.
What we can do, others, elsewhere in the universe may be able to do better.
Exactly.
Let me get this straight.
You imply that these children may be the result of impulses... directed towards us from somewhere in the universe?
Of course that's just a theory.
But there's nothing to disprove it.
They may be a case of mutation.
They may be the world's new people.
What we need is time to investigate.
- Time...
- Just a moment, Zellaby.
Gen. Leighton, you told me of some developments at Midwich.
What are they?
A series of casualties, mostly among the village children.
In each case, after some contact with the others.
Children get into fights all over the world.
These were not fights in the normal sense.
No direct physical violence was involved.
But two weeks ago, a boy, a good swimmer... was drowned in the Midwich pond for no logical reason.
Children also have accidents.
Gordon, you've seen it for yourself.
The extraordinary power these children have.
And the sinister way they use it.
Extraordinary power, certainly, yes.
That's precisely why we need time.
It's only a matter of time before these children get entirely out of hand.
With fatal consequences.
So what do you suggest?
- That they be shut away.
- You mean, put in prison?
Bluntly, yes.
You might as well do away with them altogether.
- This isn't a police state yet.
- But don't you see what you're doing?
If you imprison them, you will deprive the scientific world... of the greatest opportunity it's ever had.
- Opportunity for what?
- For study.
Gentlemen, a great deal has been said here about the power of these children.
But nothing about the nature of this power.
What we are dealing with is a mass mind.
An entirely new development.
Like a colony of ants and bees.
These children all want to dress alike... and what one learns, they all learn.
I've demonstrated this to Alan Bernard.
They are one mind to the 12th power.
Just think what it would mean if we could guide it.
We could leap forward in science a hundred years.
At the risk of being destroyed.
What cannot be understood must be put away. Is that your view?
The age-old fear of the unknown?
On the other hand, Leighton has a point.
There is a potential danger here.
We're gathered here as advisors, as scientists, as government experts.
Now take a look at our world.
Have we made a good job of it?
Who's to say that these children are not the answer?
The answer to what?
To wars, to disease, to human want and misery.
To all of the problems we've been unable to cope with.
If they don't make an end of us in the meantime.
We can't throw away this potential because of a few incidents.
- What is your suggestion?
- I'll compromise with Leighton.
Let them live together, under one roof, in our village, where they can observed.
My department couldn't accept the responsibility.
I personally will assume full responsibility.
Just give me a year.
- Mr. Home Secretary, I can't agree to this.
- But all I ask is a year.
Surely that's not too much time when so much is at stake.
Just give me one year.
Very well.
I will officially recommend your compromise.
Thank you, gentlemen.
That's as far as we shall go today.
Our next lecture will deal with structure.
And by the way, don't forget you'll be living here from tomorrow.
Now...
Why do you smile? David?
You don't know how to put your question.
There isn't much point my trying to be subtle, is there?
The question I was going to put was...
By the way... just how deep do you see into my mind?
Everything that's in the front of your mind.
The thought processes, the reasoning that leads to my spoken words?
We still have to master that. It will come.
That's frank. Thank you, David.
At least I still have some privacy.
The question I want to ask is this:
Are you aware of life on another planet?
Then let me put it this way:
It is possible that life exists elsewhere, isn't it?
We don't seem to be getting anywhere.
Why are you so nervous when an aircraft flies above you?
You've very observant, Father.
That doesn't answer my question.
All right. Until recently, we haven't been able to make...
- our control reach as far as a high aircraft.
- And now you have, is that it?
What are you going to do with that power?
Father, we know what you're trying to find out.
It would be better if you didn't ask these questions.
We want to learn from you.
All right, that'll be all for today.
- David.
- Yes, Father?
I'll walk home with you.
What I meant was that you don't have to go, David, if you don't want to.
I'd rather go.
Because the others are moving into the school... you feel you must, too. Is that the logic?
- Yes.
- Your mother is quite distressed about it.
I don't really know why I should be.
Lots of parents send their children away to school... and David will only be half a mile away.
I suppose there is nothing that will make you change your mind?
No.
I think that's all.
Thank you.
I'm very sorry. It was all my fault.
You all right?
Mrs. Zellaby, I wish you'd be more specific in your testimony.
I know these things are difficult... but it is our obligation to determine the responsibility for this man's death.
I find it very difficult to remember.
You told Constable Gobby you heard the screech of his brakes.
Yes, that's right.
He got out of the car.
Then what did he do, Mrs. Zellaby?
Then he got back into the car... and drove straight for the wall.
Thank you, Mrs. Zellaby.
I don't think we need go any further.
It seems to me quite apparent what happened here.
Edward Pawle, the deceased, his vision obscured... came close to striking and injuring a child.
Then, obviously in nervous shock, struck the wall.
I recommend that you bring in a verdict of accidental death.
Mrs. Zellaby, you know they killed him.
Ask them!
Just ask them!
Who is that man?
James Pawle, sir, brother of the deceased.
Then I shall overlook this outburst.
Can't you see now that Midwich is living on top of a volcano?
A force is building up.
Sooner or later, it's bound to explode.
We still haven't any proof.
How much more proof do you need?
The death of James Pawle...
I'm much more aware of the situation than you think...
Why not? Look what they did to my brother.
- This won't bring him back.
- Who's going to stop them?
You can't stop them with that, believe me.
They're not human.
They ought to be destroyed.
Go home, Jim. I said, go home!
Leave here now before they get any closer.
All right, Mr. Zellaby.
All right, I'm responsible.
I've never denied it.
It's quite possible that, but for me, these two men would be alive.
I was over-optimistic.
There's a shindig in London.
They maybe after your blood.
Do you think I care a rap about that?
What beats me is that I failed to reach the children.
They're shouting for action, now!
Things have gone too far.
The village is very near panicky.
If only I could got inside the children's minds and read their thoughts... since, quite obviously, they can read ours.
Doesn't that assume they have thoughts in mind?
As we understand them?
Alan, it's for you. Gen. Leighton.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Yes, sir?
I see. Yes, sir.
It's as though their minds were surrounded by... a brick wall.
If only I could break through it.
Yes, sir, certainly.
Have I your permission to pass this on?
Right, thank you, sir. Goodbye.
I'm afraid there have been grave developments.
The Russian army group in the Western Urals... is equipped with a new type of gun.
It can project a shell up to 60 miles.
An atomic shell.
Apparently they tried it out yesterday... on the village of Raminsk, where their children live.
And the village of Raminsk no longer exists.
- You mean everyone there?
- The entire place.
They gave no warning, couldn't evacuate the villagers... without the children learning what was to happen.
They'd developed more quickly than ours.
They'd begun to take control.
An attempt to move them with the soldiers... proved disastrous to the troops and the adults.
I see.
So now I suppose we're going to blow
Midwich off the face of the earth?
No.
But in view of recent events, they feel your compromise has failed.
Leighton feels we ought to move, immediately, before it's too late.
Destroy them?
Well, they're meeting tonight to come to a decision.
They want me in town.
What I say is, it's got to stop!
Yeah!
First Ed, then Jim Pawle.
The authorities don't do nothing.
Are we going to wait until we all get wiped out?
- No!
- All right then.
Those that are with me, follow me!
David, come here.
I want to speak to you.
A man is dead.
We must protect ourselves.
- The law exists for your protection.
- It's of no use to us.
No use to you, is it?
If you think you'll be allowed to live by your laws... laws we don't subscribe to...
You're thinking of what happened to the others, in another country.
Yes, if you know about that you should know what to expect.
It will not happen to us.
- You little...
- It will not happen to us... because we have to survive, no matter what the cost.
I don't think you'll go to London.
We are now the only ones left... and you must learn that we are determined to survive.
And that there's nothing you can do to stop us.
You have to be taught to leave us alone.
Leave us alone.
He's out of danger now.
Go to the library, and I'll join you there.
I've never seen as severe a case of shock as this. It's medically impossible.
For a while, he was totally paralyzed.
Now his pupils are returning to normal... his pulse is less rapid, his color's returning.
I've never seen anything like this before.
- It's time London sent in some troops.
- I talked to Gen. Leighton.
Troops are not the answer.
The children would only make them shoot one another.
Tonight should be enough for all of us, even me.
- What is the answer, then?
- I don't know.
But no more people must be hurt.
Is there no limit to the power of these children?
No more than there is a limit to the mind.
- What do you want here?
- I want to speak to my father.
Why do you do these dreadful things?
Wherever it is you come from, you are part of us now.
Couldn't you learn to live with us and help us live with you?
I want to speak to my father.
The effect seems to be wearing off.
Maj. Bernard will be all right.
What we did was only to warn him... and all of you.
Leave us, Anthea, please.
You are not afraid of us.
No.
But I'm sorry, David, sorry I was wrong about you.
If you didn't suffer from emotions, from feelings...
- you could be as powerful as we are.
- Yes.
You'll never reach our minds.
I've come to say it's time for us to go.
Go where?
Away from here before they try to destroy us.
- What will you do?
- Spread out and disperse.
Soon we'll have reached the stage where we can form new colonies.
In the meantime, we've attracted too much attention.
You must help us to leave.
How would you wish me to help you?
You'll arrange a method of getting us away from here... without attracting attention.
You'll find a number of families spread over the country that'll take us in.
Yes, that'll take a bit of organizing.
I'll need a few days.
Yes. And be sure no one finds out.
Otherwise, more people will be hurt.
You'll tell us the arrangements you have made... when you come to give us our lesson on Friday.
You won't be able to deceive us.
You know that, don't you?
Yes, I know that.
Very well. Let us know your arrangements on Friday.
Good night, Father.
Good night, David.
A brick wall.
All right now?
Yes, sight's still a bit foggy, but clearing all the time.
I'll just go and tell Gordon.
You remember this?
You wore a dark blue dress.
Your hair was longer then.
It caught the moonlight.
- We're ready, Gordon.
- Good.
I wish you'd...
It's 8:15, you'll be in London by 9:30.
I wish you'd let me stay here or come with us.
You know that isn't possible.
I've things to do here.
And poor old Alan would go into the nearest tree if we let him drive.
Nothing like feeling useless.
You're still going to see the children tonight?
Yes.
- Every Wednesday and Friday.
- After what happened?
Especially after what happened.
I think I've found a way of getting through to them.
If I'm right, we'll have no further trouble.
How?
I'll tell you if I succeed.
Now come on, I don't want you to be on the road all night.
Here now.
- This isn't like you.
- I know.
It's silly of me, but I'm afraid of them... and I'm afraid for you whenever you're with them.
They won't harm me.
In a strange way, they trust me.
Why, even David seems to accept me.
Divorced from my emotions, of course.
All right?
Off you go.
Alan, look after her for me.
I'll give you a ring in the morning.
Yes, in the morning.
A brick wall.
I have to think of a brick wall.
I'm sorry, old man. You can't come.
Look after your mistress.
- What did he mean?
- What?
Why should he ask you to take care of me?
I don't know.
Just a manner of speech, I suppose.
What's the matter?
- Alan, I'm going back.
- Why?
I'm going back.
Good evening, children.
Tonight we shall talk about atomic energy... and how discoveries made about 100 years ago... completely changed our conception... of the elements and the place of the atom.
You were to tell us tonight what arrangements you've made for us.
The place of the atom.
It's 8:27.
Why are you nervous?
The arrangements, yes.
Yes, I'll tell you about those in a few moments.
But first of all, I want to finish my lesson.
The question of atomic energy.
You're not thinking of atomic energy.
You're thinking of... a brick wall.
A brick wall.
I must think of a brick wall.
I must think of a brick wall.
It's almost 8:30.
Only a few seconds.
Brick wall.
This yacht is bringing a revolutionary
scientific invention to Gotham City.
On a peaceful motor ride,
millionaire Bruce Wayne...
... and his ward, Dick Grayson,
have been summoned to Wayne Manor...
... by an urgent but anonymous
call for help.
The invention and its custodian
are reported in grave danger...
... aboard the yacht.
Never ones
to shirk responsibility...
... Bruce and Dick, with
characteristic speed and resolve...
... descend promptly to the Batcave.
And then, as they have done
many times before...
... as Batman and Robin,
courageous warriors against crime...
... they are off, once again,
to the rescue.
Batteries to power.
Turbines to speed.
Roger. Ready to move out.
Batmobile to airport, red alert.
Prepare Batcopter for takeoff.
Batmobile approaching.
Red Alert! Gotham Tower to all
aircraft in the control zone.
Enter your holding pattern.
Batcopter cleared for takeoff.
It's good to know they're up there doing their job.
Batdrift angle: 03 to starboard.
Roger. Correcting to port.
Altitude: 317. Sink rate: 0.49.
- Drop Bat ladder.
- Bat ladder away.
Lock computer on afterdeck.
Set automatic Bathold.
Watch out. This could be tricky.
Have no fear. I'll keep all my wits about me. So long, for a minute.
Batman to Robin, ease off on the power!
Increase sink rate!
Roger! Wilco!
Take her up!
Holy sardine!
Hand me down the shark-repellent Bat spray!
- Enough pictures.
- This press conference must be brief.
- You're lucky they'll talk to you.
- Mr. Merrick of The Gotham City Times.
A yacht approaching the city is said to have disappeared.
- Nonsense. How can a yacht disappear?
- It isn't true?
I stand on my answer.
Mr. Stanley of The Globe.
This yacht belonged to the famous Big Ben Distilleries.
Isn't the proprietor,
Commodore Schmidlapp...
...bringing a new invention from Big Ben's lab?
- No more questions about that ship.
- What about that shark?
An unfortunate animal who chanced to swallow a floating mine.
I wouldn't worry about that.
You there, Miss...
Comrade Kitanya Irenya Tatanya
Karenska Alisoff.
From The Moscow Bugle.
You grace us with your presence.
May I be of service?
Please, take off the mask to give the better picture.
- Batman take off his mask?
- The woman must be mad.
Please, Chief O'Hara, all of you.
This young lady is a stranger.
Her request is not unnatural...
...however, impossible to grant.
- Impossible?
- Indeed.
If we were to remove our masks, our true identities would be revealed.
- Ruining their value as crime fighters.
- Not even we know who they are.
In fact, our own relatives don't know.
But your so curious costumes...
Don't be put off by them.
Under this we're ordinary Americans.
You're like the masked vigilantes in the Westerns?
Batman and Robin are deputized agents of the law!
- "Support your police" is our message.
- Well said, Robin.
And no better way to end this conference.
- Thank you and good day.
- Batman...
Never mind, everybody out.
Come on, we're all busy here.
A fine job. You allayed their fears.
If I'd told the truth, panic would grip the city.
The truth. And what is the truth?
A decoy. An anonymous warning...
...that Schmidlapp's in danger, to lure me into a trap.
An attempt on his life.
While they were luring you to a watery grave...
...the yacht was being hijacked?
- Precisely!
- And who behind it?
What known super criminals are at large now?
I'll check at once, Batman.
Let's have the latest status report on criminals at large. Thank you.
Coming up on the closed-circuit TV screen.
Status report. Known super criminals
not currently imprisoned.
The Penguin.
That pompous waddling master of foul play.
- The Joker!
- Devilish clown prince of crime!
If I had a nickel for every time he baffled us!
The Riddler loose too?
So it seems.
To plague us with his conundrums.
- Gosh, and the Catwoman!
- End of status report.
Could be any one of them, but which one?
Which ones?
Pretty fishy what happened to me on that ladder.
- Where there's a fish, there's Penguin.
- Wait! It happened at sea.
See? "C" for Catwoman!
Yet, that exploding shark was pulling my leg.
- The Joker!
- It all adds up to a sinister riddle.
Riddle-er. Riddler?
A thought strikes me.
So dreadful I scarcely dare give it utterance.
The four of them.
Their forces combined.
- Holy nightmare!
- Batman, could it be?
I don't know.
But I think I know where to find a clue.
Robin, to the Batcave!
We haven't one moment to lose!
Ahoy, Catwoman.
How many times have I told you?
Never use my real name in public!
You and your trained exploding shark!
How should I know they'd have a can...
...of shark-repellent Bat spray?
You sniveling sardine!
You pompous puffed-up penguin!
Friends, make peace.
Have a shake on me.
A joke a day keeps the gloom away!
Sic them, Hecate, scratch out their eyes.
- Take away that ravenous panther!
- I'll feed him to the birds.
I'll incapacitate it with my trick confetti!
"United Underworld."
We're about as united...
...as the members of the United World headquarters.
- What's the matter with you all?
- She's right.
If we don't manage to swallow our super-criminal pride...
Right, Mr. Riddler, quite right!
We must hang together, or we shall hang separately.
What a pity that would be on the eve of the greatest criminal coup ever!
- How did it go, Catwoman?
- Purr-fectly. Purr-fectly.
In my disguise as Kitka,
I penetrated their press conference.
- The fools are completely baffled.
- But undrowned.
Yes, unfortunately.
Batman's boots didn't even look damp!
Our prisoner still doesn't know he's kidnapped?
He hasn't the foggiest.
He just keeps ringing for his tea.
- There he goes again.
- Take it to him, man.
Come in.
Your tea, commodore.
Thank you, steward.
Good service aboard this yacht.
We strive to give satisfaction, sir.
Your face has the most ghastly pallor.
Are you getting enough sea air?
My duties keep me mostly undercover.
Too bad, too bad.
How much longer will this yacht be fogbound off the Grand Banks?
I couldn't say, sir.
Well, gives me a chance to catch up on my Dickens.
Still, I'd like to get to Gotham City.
I've a clever invention with me, stored in the hold.
Should be worth millions of dollars, pip-pip!
Well, pip-pip to you, sir! If you wish anything further, just ring!
Schmidlapp's invention in our hands...
...the whole world almost literally in our grasp!
And Batman and Robin still alive to block us.
Everything pip-pip with the prisoner!
He hasn't a clue.
- I bet the Dynamic Duo has.
- What?
A clue on how we made that ship disappear.
- And when they solve it...
- They'll be out to investigate.
But we'll be there first.
If we hurry, that is.
Catwoman, you tend to this headquarters.
- Attention, you unfathomable finks!
- Yo-ho!
Call down to our secret river-bottom dock.
- Prepare our submarine for sea.
- Yo-ho!
- Yo-ho what?
- Sir!
Holy Merlin magician!
Get set for a shock.
The Batcamera was aimed at the yacht.
- My strange hunch was right.
- I don't get it...
Think! As you remarked, no one can make...
...a seagoing vessel simply disappear.
Provided it was ever really there at all.
- You mean...?
- Precisely!
The yacht we thought we saw was a mere illusion.
A tricky projection akin to the common desert mirage.
It deceived our naked eyes...
...but was blocked by the Batcamera's Batfilter!
I know where that projection came from.
- Observe that bell buoy.
- What about it?
The coordinates of our position were 10.3 by 69-B.
Feed those figures into the navigational aid computer.
No legal bell buoy at that position.
As I surmised, an illegal projection buoy cleverly camouflaged.
Maybe the crooks left fingerprints!
Good thinking, let's find out.
To the Batboat, fast!
One thing I don't dig, Batman.
If that ship was a mirage, where's the real one?
Taken to some secret island hideaway with every soul aboard, save one.
- Commodore Schmidlapp?
- Precisely.
For some reason the hijackers needed him...
...or his invention as part of their criminal scheme.
Keep an eye on the scope.
Watch for suspicious vessels.
It looks like we've got the whole ocean to ourselves.
Diving planes, Mr. Bluebeard, three degrees.
Hoist three degrees.
I hope you know what you're doing, Penguin.
Mr. Riddler, I ignore your insipid insinuation, sir!
Mr. Joker, you're leaning on the control!
Don't sound so bossy, if you please!
As the poet says:
"On land, you may command.
At sea, it is me!"
Now hear this. This is your captain speaking, my fine pinioned pirates.
We're approaching the buoy.
There may be skullduggery ahead!
- Yo-ho!
- What? What?
Unidentified small craft, bearing 113.
Mr. Bluebeard, hold her steady!
Up periscope!
Great quivering icebergs!
Just as I hoped.
Watch your step.
An underwater shark cage.
The source of that fish.
What cruelty!
Stuffing a poor shark with deadly TNT!
Nothing's sacred to those devils.
Torpedoes! What are we waiting for?
Chain of command, Mr. Riddler.
The Penguin runs the ship.
Now hear this, Mr. Joker.
Load the torpedo tubes!
Load torpedo tubes!
Salt and corrosion.
The infamous old enemies of the crime fighter. No prints here.
Look here, Batman.
That tricky mirage projector must be behind this plate.
Wow! What a set of superpower lenses!
No wonder we were fooled.
Look, Robin.
Holy Long John Silver!
A pirate periscope!
He spotted us! Set torpedoes to automatic homing.
Set torpedoes to automatic homing!
You crazy bird.
Fire them off, quickly!
Activate the remote control
Penguin magnet inside that buoy.
Holy glue pot! What's going on?
The fiends! They've converted this buoy into a gigantic magnet!
It's got us by the metallic objects in our utility belts.
Torpedo tubes armed!
Batman! We're helpless in this monstrous, invisible grip!
- Steady, Robin. I see one hope.
- What, Batman?
If I could just pry loose my utility belt transmitter!
- Mr. Joker, are you ready to fire?
- Yo-ho, ready to fire!
Five, four, three, two.
- Fire 1!
- Fire 1!
Torpedoes!
If I can just reverse the polarity, send out waves of super energy.
- What happened?
- Mr. Joker, fire 2!
Fire 2!
Here comes another one!
You and your reconditioned surplus torpedoes!
He must be using a super energy reverse polarizer! Mr. Joker, fire 3!
Fire 3!
Here comes a third one!
Confound it, the batteries are dead!
This one's getting through!
It is. It's getting through.
Surface, Mr. Bluebeard!
Let us feast our eyes on the watery remains!
Gosh, the nobility of the almost-human porpoise.
True, Robin.
It was noble of that animal...
...to hurl himself into the path of that torpedo.
He gave his life for ours.
Operator, give me the Pentagon,
Navy department.
Too bad.
Admiral Fangschliester's office.
Hello, Batman speaking.
- Who is it?
- Batman.
Oh, Batman.
Hello, Batman. Ahoy!
What can I do for you?
Hello, admiral.
A routine question.
Have you recently sold surplus submarines? If so, to whom?
Just a moment,
I'll have to look that up.
Keep practicing.
Answer: Affirmative. We disposed of a surplus submarine on Friday.
A pre-atomic model.
To some chap named P.N. Gwynne.
- P.N. Gwynne?
- The Penguin!
Did this P.N. Gwynne leave an address?
Just a post office box number.
Would you like it?
No, thank you, admiral.
You've been very helpful.
Your tone sounds grim.
We haven't done anything foolish?
Disposing of submarines to persons who don't even leave their addresses?
- Good day, admiral.
- Gosh!
The Penguin in command of a pre-atomic submarine!
- Grave situation, Robin.
- If only we knew what he was up to!
Holy Polaris!
From that submarine, no doubt.
That missile, it's written something.
A riddle, in the form of a joke!
Let's race back to headquarters.
You know what this means, don't you?
Our fear is confirmed. Penguin,
Joker, Riddler, their forces combined.
- Heaven only knows the objective!
- It may be worse.
- Saints alive, how can that be?
- Look at this pair of riddles.
"What does a turkey do when he flies upside down?"
- He gobbles up.
- And number two.
"What weighs 6 ounces, sits in a tree and is dangerous?"
- A sparrow with a machine gun.
- Of course.
Now, combine both answers.
What kind of creature would gobble up a bird in a tree?
Heaven protect us, a cat!
Yes, the criminal catalyst in this entire affair...
...our old archenemy, Catwoman.
Penguin, Joker, Riddler and Catwoman too!
The sum of the angles of that rectangle is monstrous.
We've been given warning.
They work to take over...
- Gotham City?
- Any two of them might try that!
- The whole country?
- If it were three, I'd say yes.
But four?
Their minimum objective must be...
...the entire world.
The United World building, dear comrades in crime.
Our objective, the Security Council.
Sitting like fat birds in a tree just waiting to be snatched.
And you bungled it!
The Dynamic Duo escaped our trap!
Passing porpoises which intercept torpedoes!
There ought to be a piscatorial statute!
Time is short! We've got to get Batman before he gets us.
I could lure him into a giant exploding octopus...
After one of your fishy explosions, they're still in one piece.
I suppose they'll be broken up by your moldy jokes!
Shut up, all of you!
I see the way to do it.
We'll play each of our treacherous trumps in one hand.
And we'll do it right here!
- How?
- How?
The end.
The end of...
We shall spring them from the Joker's jack-in-the-box...
...through that window, out over the sea...
...and into the waiting arms of the Penguin's exploding octopus!
The trigger? One of my riddles.
And the bait? You, Catwoman.
You're mad.
The minute Batman spots her...
...he'll bop her with a Batarang.
You don't understand.
She will be disguised as Kitka.
And as Kitka, she shall lure some millionaire into a kidnap trap.
Of course!
With a clever clue pointing here.
- Batman will race to the rescue.
- Capital!
But who are we going to kidnap?
I know the perfect victim.
I know the perfect victim! I know!
Bruce Wayne, the millionaire head...
...of that disgusting do-gooding
Wayne Foundation.
Delicious! Just the sort of square citizen Batman will dash to rescue.
- Then snap!
- Into the combination trap.
Purr-fect, Riddler, purr-fect.
Comrade Wayne? My name is Kitanya
Irenya Tatanya Karenska Alisoff.
I'm from The Moscow Bugle.
My friends call me Kitka.
Kitka. Kitka, a charming acronym.
Thank you, Comrade Wayne.
The Wayne Foundation is known from Leningrad to Kamchatka.
It works for peace and understanding.
Your picture has appeared countless times in The Moscow Bugle.
I'm most grateful,
I wasn't aware of that.
You found these riddles on Wayne
Foundation stationery under your door?
Yes, Comrade Wayne.
That's why I brought them to you.
I thought it was some foolishness, then I remembered:
Is there not a bourgeois criminal cad...
...the Riddler, who preys upon the workers?
Your jargon is quaint, Miss Kitka.
But there is such a creature.
What do we do now? Report these riddles to your police...
...or perhaps to that Cossack Batman?
That's hardly necessary at the moment.
Doubtless it's the work of some harmless crank.
Nevertheless, shall we give this matter further consideration...
...over dinner tonight?
What a purr-fectly lovely idea.
I'll telephone to cancel a previous engagement.
Alfred will see you to the door.
Do vechera.
Do vechera, Comrade Wayne.
Alfred, see Miss Kitka out, please.
Meet me in the Batcave. Emergency.
Very good, sir.
Listen to these riddles.
Tell me if you interpret them as I do.
- "What has yellow skin and writes?"
- A ballpoint banana.
Right. "What people are always in a hurry?"
Rushing people? Russians!
Right again.
What would you say they mean?
Banana, Russian...
A Russian will slip on a banana peel and break their neck!
Precisely, the only possible meaning.
- A clear threat to Miss Kitka's life.
- Who?
Miss Kitka, the charming Russian journalist for The Moscow Bugle.
In some way she must have unwittingly stumbled on the criminals' plot!
What is the scheme?
Tonight Bruce Wayne will go out on the town with Miss Kitka.
- A not displeasing chore.
- Indeed.
I've rarely met a girl...
...who's a potent argument in favor of international relations.
You will dog our footsteps in the Batmobile.
You'll keep watch via the Batscanner.
- If the Riddler tries to make good...
- I'll bash him brutally.
Then we close in with the police.
- Got your driver's license?
- In my wallet.
Good man. Drive carefully. Good luck!
This may be a memorable night.
This curtain which separates our countries is so foolish.
If we could just contrive...
...some way of getting more deeply involved with each other.
Da, we must search for such a method.
It's wrong to listen to this.
Some things have to be private, even for a crime fighter.
Your discretion is admirable,
Master Robin, yes.
- Time for another check-in.
- Roger.
- Commissioner.
- Yes?
- Yes, Boy Wonder.
- Batmobile position:
Gotham Park, proceeding south on West Drive.
About to pass
Benedict Arnold monument.
Still in the park? It's been almost an hour. What are they doing?
No comment, commissioner. Let's just say, no sign of criminal activity.
Yes, I understand.
I've just thought of a clever ruse.
Have Chief O'Hara flash the Batsignal.
If you say so, but why?
The crooks will think we're racing to headquarters.
Thinking we're out of the way, they might strike at Miss Kitka!
Devilishly clever!
- Thank you. Batmobile over and out.
- Right.
- Chief O'Hara, flash the Batsignal.
- Yes, sir.
Shades of Smolensk, what is that?
Incredible, I don't...
- Of course! How clever.
- Clever, Comrade Wayne?
I mean, clever device, Miss Kitka.
It's the Batsignal, from the roof of police headquarters.
Batman must be racing there in response.
Then you did get the police to call them in for my protection.
Yes, yes.
How purr-fectly wonderful of you!
I close my eyes and I dream of those savage Cossacks...
...racing over the steps on their mission.
How strange.
I close my eyes, and I dream of something...
...quite astonishingly different.
Keep your eyes closed.
Continue with this dream.
The dream continues.
It approaches a climax.
Not so fast. Be more slow.
Miss Kitka?
May I see you home to that penthouse apartment?
- He swallowed the Catbait!
- And now to make him Batbait.
Finks, Morgan, Bluebeard, Quetch, the jetpack umbrellas!
I'll slip into something more comfortable...
...while your cocoa is warming.
Is that prudent?
Our instructions were to keep watch.
I don't know about prudent.
But it's the only decent thing to do.
Perhaps. Yes, yes.
There it is, 73rd Street and Concord Avenue.
Follow me down to the terrace.
And all my days are trances
And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy dark eye glances
And where thy footstep gleams
Edgar Allan Poe, Miss Kitka.
"To One in Paradise," first stanza.
About that dream you had...
- Do we dare?
- Why not?
Yes, of course. Why not?
Of what use is a dream if not a blueprint for courageous action?
Into action, comrade.
Miss Kitka,
I have the strangest feeling...
...that I am about to be utterly and madly carried away.
- This is a kidnapping!
- Our joke's on you!
You filthy criminals!
- Much as one deplores indiscretion...
- Right.
I'll just take one tiny, tiny peek.
- Holy demolition!
- Bless my dustpan!
Cover the exits.
I'll race up with my Batrope!
Holy Halloween!
Strange, Batman should've been here hours ago.
Maybe you didn't leave a clear enough clue.
I did! I can't understand why
Batman hasn't dashed into our trap.
He puts his foot here, my secret jack-in-the-box fires...
...shooting him over the sea...
...into the waiting arms of Penguin's exploding octopus.
What a deliciously humorous trajectory!
And nothing to link us with the crime.
You abominable outlaws!
What have you done with Miss Kitka?
She's quite well, Mr. Wayne.
I swear by heaven, if you've harmed that girl...
...I'll kill you all.
I'll rend you limb from limb!
Mr. Wayne, must you be so impulsive?
Where is she?
Show me Miss Kitka...
...or I'll wreck this place with my dying breath!
Blindfold the captive.
Lead him down the labyrinthine path to chamber 17.
Two minutes, no more.
- Turn on the secret microphone.
- Quiet, quiet!
- Miss Kitka.
- Comrade Wayne.
Are you all right?
I'll curse myself forever.
This nasty soup we're in is of my brewing.
If I hadn't let your beauty lull me off guard...
Off guard, comrade?
There are some things
I cannot disclose.
But we're in the hands of the most vicious foursome.
I fear we have nothing
to look forward to but death.
It may not be that black,
Comrade Wayne.
Batman and Robin are probably hot on our trail.
From something
I happened to overhear...
... I think we are merely
bait for Batman.
Once he's in their trap,
we'll be released.
A slender hope, Miss Kitka.
More slender than you can know.
You do not think
Batman will get here?
That I cannot say.
Did you overhear any mention...
...of any other prisoner of this rotten gang?
No, I did not.
Who on earth could you mean?
Commodore Schmidlapp ringing for his tea.
Just a thought, it doesn't matter.
Speedy escape is our only hope.
A moment, while I think...
Why didn 't I think of it sooner?
Of what?
Up my sleeve I have a radio transmitter strapped above my elbow.
- What a curious device to carry.
- Not at all.
Capitalists who carry a lot of money have safety contrivances.
If I can just get at it...
Wiggle around back-to-back.
Maybe you can reach it with your fingers.
Let's get him.
There we are.
You think you're pretty clever, don't you?
- Clever enough to outwit you.
- We'll see about that.
Dear colleagues, let's see what's strapped above his left elbow.
Cretinous creatures!
I knew you'd been listening in!
I told you that fish story about a radio...
Get him!
Miss Kitka! Where are you?
- Great day!
- Hello, commissioner.
Dick, we're late for that demonstration. Excuse us.
But you can't dash off now.
How did you escape?
- With the aid of Batman.
- Thank goodness for the Caped Crusader.
Return to police headquarters.
He may wish to call you.
My fine finkish friends, you have heard my astounding proposal.
What do you say?
What do you say?!
Our strike cannot be postponed.
We're at the mercy of the Gotham River tide.
It's now or never to get through the channel.
Batman will never come here now.
But the police will, any instant.
So, to the Penguin's princely plan.
Is it yes or no?
It's crazy, but let's try it.
We have to get Batman out of the way.
Oh, go ahead, Penguin.
Would you drop one of your dream pills into Commodore Schmidlapp's tea?
- Presto!
- Then carry him to the submarine!
Mr. Riddler, will you tell Mr. Quetch...
...to fetch the five guinea pigs?
Fetch the guinea pigs.
Yo-ho-ho, sir!
Now, my fine fishy finks...
...you see the commodore's pièce de "no-résistance"...
...an instant whiskey maker.
Waiting for us to put it to more universal use.
Don't be afraid.
You'll feel nothing.
I am merely going to temporarily extract...
...every bit of moisture from your bodies!
It's a painless operation.
- Delightful!
- Dehydrated!
Catwoman, will you get a dustpan...
...and put every one of them very carefully into separate vials?
Mr. Riddler, would you prepare the submarine to get underway...
...while I prepare a terrifying demolition charge for the police?
- Where do we meet?
- United World building.
Gotham River.
39th floor. The elevator.
- One hour?
- One hour.
What criminal genius, Catwoman!
Who but a genius could conceive such an audacious plot?
To trick Batman and Robin into inviting me to their Batcave...
...with five dehydrated death-dealing pirates at my command.
Careful, careful.
Every one of them has a mother.
Out, Batarang and Batrope.
Stand clear.
With people in weird outfits like the supercrooks around here...
...it's amazing no one reports this place to the police!
It's a low neighborhood, full of rum pots.
They attribute curious sights to alcoholic delusions.
Drink is a filthy thing.
I'd rather be dead than unable to trust my own eyes.
Yes, honey. There was someone walking up the wall.
Ready with super-blinding Batpellets.
- Away, Robin. Away!
- But...
Come on, Batman.
Batman!
Miss Kitka!
Quick, everyone!
Flee for your lives! Into the street!
Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb.
- It's all right.
- Holy heart failure!
I was able to dispose of that bomb just in time...
...and shield myself behind these iron pipes.
You risked your life to save that riffraff in the bar?
They may be drinkers, but they're also human beings...
...and may be salvaged.
I had to do it!
But we lost the trail of Miss Kitka.
Stranded without a clue!
Ahoy there! Could you chaps direct me to a policeman?
Commodore Schmidlapp's the name.
Big Ben Distilleries, you know.
- Holy costume party. The Penguin!
- Obviously.
What's his game?
- What's your game, Penguin?
- Penguin?
No, my name's Schmidlapp, old boy, Schmidlapp.
Your fingerprints will settle that hash.
We'll check them against our mobile anti-crime file in our Batmobile.
Let's see your hands.
Looks like plastic-coated fingertips!
Yes, I scorched myself pressing a waistcoat.
I do believe the attending surgeon did use plastic, yes.
It looks bad.
This brassy bird has us buffaloed.
Not quite.
There's one method of identification no one can evade.
Retinal eye patterns?
He's right. The pattern of blood vessels...
...in the retina, as individual as a fingerprint.
Don't you have an anti-criminal, eye-pattern master file...
...in your Batcave?
Why don't you take me there?
- You'll submit yourself to a test?
- It might be an amusing experience.
Stand by to catch him, Robin.
I'll give him the Batgas.
What? Batgas?
An anesthetic, necessary to prevent you from seeing...
...the entrance to the Batcave.
If anyone knew that, they could pierce the secret of our identities.
Ready, commodore?
Oh, I say, what deucedly strange customs you colonials have!
Well, I'm ready.
To the Batmobile.
This could be our break.
- I wonder why he let us take him?
- We'll soon know.
- I've got the eye checker.
- Stay on the alert.
After I give him the Batwake, we must be ready for anything.
Oh, it's you.
We're here, eh? I see.
Oh, what's this? Oh, say!
This is extraordinary!
It's absolutely extraordinary!
I must say that your laboratory exceeds the limits...
...of man's wildest imagination.
Could I trouble you for a glass of water?
Your Batgas has left me with a parched sensation.
The water dispenser is clearly marked.
All right, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Help yourself, commodore.
Slake your thirst.
You'll have worse than a parched sensation when we're through.
Perhaps, perhaps. But I am appalled by your attitude, sir.
Condemning me before the facts have been authoritatively established!
You are abrogating my constitutional rights, sir.
All set, Batman.
Come on, Penguin.
Time to rip off your false feathers.
Coming, Batman.
I'm coming at once.
Holy hallucination!
I wish it were, but it's five dehydrated pirates, rehydrated!
At them, me hearties!
Shiver them from stem to stern!
Attack them, you faltering fink!
They're gone! Popped like balloons.
How did it happen?
Whoever dehydrated those pirates...
...couldn't have foreseen their rehydration with the heavy water...
...we use to recharge the atomic pile!
It left them in an unstable condition!
You saw it yourself. The slightest impact was sufficient...
...to instantly reduce them to antimatter.
Antimatter?
You mean, they won't be coming back?
No, Robin. Not in this universe.
Let that be a lesson in the dangers...
...of tampering with the laws of Mother Nature.
My apologies, commodore.
I've done you a cruel injustice.
- You have?
- You were duped. Brainwashed.
The criminals planted those dehydrated thugs on you.
You were obviously under the influence...
...of post-hypnotic suggestion when you rehydrated them.
Come on down, commodore.
Another sniff of Batgas, and we'll all return to the city.
Are you sure you didn't hurt your head?
Perfectly. Swallow this pill.
Now, give our friend here a whiff of Batwake.
Good morning.
What's wrong?
Manifold pressure's dropping.
We'd better stop and check it.
- Sorry about that. Won't take long.
- Yes, you will!
And away we go in my Birdmobile!
One side kick for a sailor.
- You okay?
- Thanks to that anti-Penguin gas pill!
He's played right into our hands.
Via Batcycle to the Batcopter!
We'll track him to the gang's new hideout.
Disengage go-cart.
Batscanner tracking the stolen Batmobile.
Port two degrees, then steady as she goes!
Yo-ho, port two degrees!
We're almost there!
- Where are you going?
- To fire off more riddling clues.
Riddler! You're mad!
Penguin's finished Batman by now.
That miserable, waddling mountebank of a bird!
He couldn't finish a bag of popcorn!
Say Penguin failed. All the more reason not to hand them clues.
But I must! Outwitting Batman is my sole delight...
...my joy, my heaven on earth, my very paradise.
Riddler, come back!
Stolen Batmobile turning, heading up Gotham River Drive.
Polaris-type missile coming right for us!
Hold on! This may be tricky.
- Damage?
- The tail rotor's disengaged.
Brace yourself, Robin, we're going down.
This could be the end.
Now, to find my riddling
Polaris skywriter!
Look! Look, the Dynamic Duo!
I got them. I got them.
Holy horseshoe!
Some luck, landing on top of foam rubber!
The odds against it would make even the most reckless gambler cringe.
True, I did think I'd spotted it out of the corner of my eye, but...
That crazy missile wrote two more riddles.
"What goes up white and comes down yellow and white?"
An egg!
"How do you divide 17 apples among 16 people?"
Make applesauce.
Apples into applesauce.
A unification into one smooth mixture.
An egg, nature's perfect container.
The container of our future hopes.
A unification in a container of hope?
United World Organization!
Precisely!
And the Security Council meets today.
- If what I fear is true...
- Let's commandeer a taxi.
No, not at this time of day.
Luckily we're in tip-top condition.
It'll be faster if we run. Let's go!
We are now passing through the grotto.
- Depth, a half-fathom.
- Engines, dead slow astern.
Dead slow astern.
As the blueprint said, an abandoned construction elevator.
Hecate, sniff out the weak spot.
- I hope Penguin made it.
- Who needs him?
Stand back.
Hey! Can't you read?
A fine day for penguins.
My co-conspirators, we meet as planned.
No thanks to you, the Dynamic Duo has been silenced forever.
Blasted out of the sky by a coincidence!
The delicious irony of it!
Downed by Riddler's Polaris skywriter.
Happy happenstance! Hold your breath till we cross the hall.
There are still lingering traces of my finely filtered Penguin gas.
Holy marathon! I'm getting a stitch!
Let's hope it's a stitch in time that saves nine.
The nine members of the Security Council.
It is the opinion of Her Majesty that we pursue peace at all costs.
Our poor united world in microcosm.
I'm afraid they'll find our humor very, very dry.
We understand your position, but for peace...
It has always been our policy...
Quickly now!
Each one in a separate vial.
And, boys, don't anybody sneeze.
- Seal the building!
- Turn off the ventilating system!
The Security Council may have been dehydrated!
Emergency, operator.
Get me security.
Emergency, operator, emergency!
Up, up, up, up!
- Surrender! You criminals!
- The United Underworld is through!
What's this, an apparition?
One false move, and you'll find out.
We'll hurl our Batarangs!
- To the elevator!
- Catwoman! Stop, I said!
I don't think you mean that.
Miss Kitka dies if you take one more step! Go!
This way, Robin!
The Security Council, gone!
What a fiendishly clever way to abduct nine men...
...from a heavily guarded building!
Where does that elevator go?
Downstairs, to an abandoned submarine dock on the river.
Holy Captain Nemo! They'll head for sea by way of Short Island Sound.
We have just one trump card left.
Heaven help the world if we fail.
Come on!
Down periscope.
We're over the last bar.
Mr. Bluebeard, all engines full ahead.
Yo-ho, all engines full ahead!
What a delightful haul!
Mr. Riddler, will you prepare those nine radio ransom messages?
And no stupid riddles.
Make those messages plain.
One billion dollars cash, from each country.
Precisely! To be delivered to our secret island...
...by the horde of trained carrier pigeons which I shall provide.
No whimsical embellishments.
Make those messages clear!
Make those messages clear!
It's like a dream, Pengy-sweet.
Nothing can stop us now.
Sonar contact.
Range 8000. Bearing 181.
Yo-ho, sonar contact.
Small craft at 7500, bearing 01.
Small craft?
It's moving fast.
Range is down to 7000.
- The Batboat!
- Drat that cockleshell!
Mr. Bluebeard, steady on the diving planes.
I'll man the torpedo tubes.
Would you fire a surface-to-surface underwater homing missile?
Missile ahoy!
It has a homing device in its nose cone. Take evasive action.
No use. It's tracking us!
Take my Batradio.
I looked it up this morning.
That class of missile receives on a wavelength of 164. 1.
- Quickly! Send a jamming signal.
It's starting down.
Farewell, Batman!
Farewell, Dynamic Duo!
Holy bikini, that was close!
Yo-ho, small craft still closing.
Range 4000. Bearing 88.
They know how to jam our missiles.
Up to periscope depth!
Yo-ho, up to periscope depth.
- Range 3500.
- Get the Batcharge launcher.
Roger!
They hold nine of the world's most eminent men in dehydrated condition.
Our task is not to sink that sub, merely to drive it to the surface.
Forward torpedo tubes, prepare to fire.
Yo-ho! Forward torpedo tubes, prepare to fire.
Five, four, three, two...
...torpedoes, fire!
Torpedoes, fire!
Torpedoes away!
- Dive, Mr. Bluebeard, dive!
- Yo-ho, dive.
Down periscope.
Torpedo off the port bow!
Prepare to fire Batcharges in front of torpedoes.
That's too soon!
It must be Batcharges!
And that means there'll be more of the dread things meant for us!
You dismal bird!
You and your submarine!
Shut up, you feline floozy!
Mr. Bluebeard, down 30 fathoms.
Run silent, run deep.
They're diving, silent engines.
I'll circle them at full-thrust speed, diminishing radius of curvature.
Roger.
What's their bearing?
- I don't know, sir.
- You don't know?
It's changing every second.
They must be circling us.
Fire when ready.
I'll maintain curvature.
Yo-ho! Compartments A, B and C taking in water, sir!
Penguin, you know I can't take water!
You cowardly kitten, you want to live forever?
- This bird has flown around the bend!
- To cuckooland!
Riddler, Joker, do something!
We weren't meant for a watery grave!
Now hear this! Now hear this!
Blow all tanks! Surface! Surface!
Cut the Batcharges.
They've had enough, I imagine.
They're surfacing fast.
- Estimated surfacing position?
- 200 yards.
Here they come.
Diminishing speed. Ready to board.
Roger.
Pirates! To arms!
Prepare to repel boarders!
Strike your colors!
We have not yet begun to fight!
Attack!
Bon voyage, pussy.
Holy heartbreak! Miss Kitka!
Batman, I...
Say no more, Robin.
It could be compromising.
Of course.
It's just one of those things in the life of every crime fighter.
It means nothing.
Snap on the Batcuffs.
Batman to coast guard.
There's a submarine two miles east of Sandy Nose.
It's filled with human jetsam.
Come, take it in tow.
Robin. Over here, look.
The hope of the world, tottering on the brink!
Holy almost!
To think, it might have been shattered before our very eyes.
- Up, Catwoman.
- The service here has gone to pot.
What the devil is this?
The captain's costume party?
Holy jumble!
Where's the hope of the world now?
Batcentrifuge at 32,000 rpm.
Increase angstrom force in vector X.
Vector X up one notch.
- Yes, commissioner?
- What progress? Is there hope?
There's always hope.
But do you think you and Robin can separate that mingled dust...
...back into its constituent members?
With all modesty, commissioner...
...if we can't, heaven knows who can.
Truer words were never spoken.
Howdy, you all.
How are those boys doing up there?
Batman says there's hope,
Mr. President. What more can one ask?
The free world is waiting. Tell Batman
I salute him and wish him luck.
I needn 't tell you
with whom I have just spoken.
Ready for separation.
All right.
I'll activate the computer link.
Input the ethnic and national factors.
- Batman, wait a minute!
- What?
Well, with the way the world is and all...
...maybe we ought to try to improve those factors?
- Reshuffle them a little.
- No.
It's not for us to tamper with the laws of nature.
In this very Batcave, you saw a ghastly example...
...of what happens when one tries to do that.
Gosh, yes.
When you put it that way...
Here we go.
Separation accomplished.
Ready to rehydrate.
Separation accomplished.
They are ready to rehydrate.
We are ready to rehydrate.
They are ready to rehydrate.
A solemn moment, gentlemen.
One of dedication and humble supplication.
Robin, prepare to rehydrate.
Ready to rehydrate.
Turn on the water faucet.
Success! Success!
They've done it!
They've done it!
Success, success!
We've done it, we've done it!
Success! Success!
What the...?
In the interest of peace, you must hear me out!
Gentlemen, it is imperative that we limit our conversation to peace.
Who knows, Robin?
This strange mixing of minds...
...may be the greatest single service ever performed for humanity.
Let's go, but inconspicuously.
Through the window.
We'll use our Batropes.
Our job is finished.

- Can I help you?
- I don't know.
The radiator's boiling.
It's never done that before.
I had the water checked on the mainland.
- You've got anti-freeze in?
- Yes, you're supposed to in winter.
That's what's causing the overheating.
I've taken my anti-freeze out during this hot spell.
This is the best I can do, unless you want me to drain it off.
No, not now.
Tell me, is the Swan far from here?
Take the next right.
You can't miss it.
In fact, I'm going there myself.
I'd offer to show you, but I think you should let this cool down.
Do I owe you anything?
No. That's all right.
This is the BBC Home Service.
Here's the weather forecast.
Most districts will continue to be extremely cold.
Temperatures will remain below freezing point, ranging from 24º in Northern areas to 29° in the South.
However, there are exceptional conditions on the Island of Fara.
Temperatures are said to be in the region of 90°, and still rising.
90 degrees and still rising!
- Surely it can't get any hotter.
- Apparently, it can.
Yet on the mainland it's winter.
This weather doesn't make sense.
Some rain wouldn't hurt.
At least it would cool the air.
Thank you, Frankie.
- Can I help you?
- Is Mr. Callum in?
I'm afraid not. He's on his way back from the mainland.
- I'm Mrs. Callum.
- Angela Roberts, his new secretary.
Oh, yes. My husband said the agency was sending someone this week.
I've a room ready for you.
I'll show you.
I'd rather like a drink first. I'm gasping, this heat is stifling.
Yes, of course.
May I have the pleasure?
My name is Stone, Dr Stone.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll have a lager and lime, please.
And so you shall.
Is this your first visit to the island, Miss Roberts?
Yes. It's very pretty. I had a drive round after I got off the boat.
It is hot, isn't it?
We usually have the same weather as the mainland.
I'm sorry, the ice melts as soon as it's out of the fridge.
- Same again, Bob?
- No, just one for Tinker.
I must be on my way. Just the one.
Oh, that's better.
If you don't mind, I'll finish this upstairs. I'd like to freshen up.
- Of course.
- I'll show you the way.
- Is this all right for you?
- Yes, it's fine. Thanks.
Let's have some air.
Oh, I see you're reading one of my husband's books.
Yes. I thought I should. Is his new novel interesting?
He never talks about his books until they're finished, then he never stops.
- Have you worked with writers before?
- No. Mainly for publishers.
God, it's hot. It's like being in the Tropics.
When my husband gets back,
I'll tell him you're here.
- Has Callum brought my parcel?
- He'll be back soon, Mr. Hanson.
Tell him to bring it straight to my room.
- Well, he's not very polite, is he?
- No.
He's a strange character altogether.
- How long is he staying?
- Hasn't said.
We've been trying to puzzle out what he does.
Every day he goes out with his camera and masses of equipment.
He spends the rest of his time locked in his room.
He won't even let us in to clean.
Good material for one of Jeff's books.
Bob, what the hell are you doing?
Sorry, Jeff. I just wasn't thinking.
Thinking? You're lucky to be breathing.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
I thought I heard something.
I'm sure I heard something.
- Heard what?
- I don't know.
It was a sort of funny whirring noise.
Must be going off my rocker.
- I assume you've come from the Swan?
- Maybe I did have one too many.
It's this blasted heat.
Sorry again, Jeff.
Forget it. No harm done.
But take it easy.
Hi, Ken. Buying up the whole place?
We've got to keep cool.
The Met Station's like an oven.
They envy us on the mainland.
My publisher's threatening to pay me a visit.
Tell him to bring some snow.
We could use it.
Haven't you experts figured out what's causing this heat?
Or are we stuck with the villagers' theory that it's the bomb?
The bomb? To be perfectly honest, one theory's as good as another.
We haven't a clue. See you later.
If the heat or the DTs don't get you first!
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.
- Everything okay?
- Yes, thanks. Good trip?
Yes, apart from nearly knocking down Bob Hayward.
He was in the middle of the road.
How I missed him, I don't know.
Strange. He was all right when he left here, wasn't he?
- Is that Mr. Hanson's parcel?
- Yes. Why?
He's been asking about it.
He ordered it be taken to his room, immediately.
Did he? Must be important.
I'll take it up straight away.
- Yes, who is it?
- Your parcel, Mr. Hanson.
Come on, give it to me!
I forgot to tell you. Your new secretary has arrived.
- She's quite the modern miss.
- Really? Where is she now?
At the cove. She went for a swim.
I'll give you a lift.
Fine. I won't be long, darling.
- I'll be off then, Jeff.
- Yeah.
- Hello, Jeff.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- You know why I'm here.
- Then you made a mistake.
I hope you haven't unpacked.
You're not staying.
Come for a swim. It's fabulous.
Did you hear what I said?
You're getting out of here.
Don't shout at me. You always did go on. Cool down.
Now listen to me,
I'm not going through your special brand of madness again.
Aren't you?
For 3 months, I wrote nothing.
I nearly wrecked my marriage.
I'm not going through it again.
You can't just have a girl and then walk away.
Don't pull that on me.
You were no untouched virgin when we met.
How long was it before we tumbled into your bed? Two hours?
- You needn't wait so long this time.
- You haven't taken in a word.
- You're clearing out.
- Just like that?
Just like that.
What are you going to tell your wife?
That's my problem.
That you didn't like the look of me?
As far as she's concerned,
I'm just your new secretary.
You never did tell her about us, did you?
- What's that noise?
- I don't know.
Sounds as if it came from beyond the point.
It's weird.
Strange.
Bob said he heard a peculiar noise when I nearly ran him over.
Jeff.
Get dressed.
What happened?
I found him wandering on the road by his meadow, in a fair old state.
He keeps on about his sheep being dead.
What's the matter, Ben?
It's my sheep. They all be dead.
Someone's killed my sheep.
- Can he lie down somewhere?
- There's a couch in my study.
- How were they killed?
- Come on, Ben.
- I said how were they killed?
- He's in no state to answer questions.
I asked a straightforward question.
There's no harm in that.
- You found the old man?
- Yes.
- Did you see the sheep?
- No.
Only Ben wandering about, half out of his mind.
- Who's he?
- He's a guest. His name's Hanson.
Why is he so interested in the sheep? What is he?
I don't know. He spends his time locked in his room.
I'd like him to rest for a while.
- Give time for the sedative to work.
- Of course.
What do you think happened?
Do you think his sheep are all dead?
Who can tell? With this heat it's difficult to know what's going on.
Give Mrs. Siddle a ring, will you?
Tell her I'll be bringing Ben home.
Mr. Hanson...
Why is he so interested in how those sheep died?
- Why don't you ask him?
- How's Ben?
- He's calmed down.
- Did he say what happened?
No. Mumbled they were dead.
Nothing coherent.
The Doctor's not sure if it's just the heat affecting him.
Mrs. Siddle? Jeff Callum.
Ben's with us.
He's not feeling well. Dr
Stone will bring him home.
He thinks there's something wrong with the sheep.
What's that? I'm sorry,
I can't hear you.
Don't worry. He'll be home soon!
If the crisis is over,
I'd better start work.
Where's the typewriter and manuscript?
Mr. Callum?
- Jeff.
- You can't start.
It's in the study where Ben's resting.
In that case, I'll go and change.
- Yes?
- It's me. Can I come in?
Yes, come in.
Forget it. I didn't come for that.
You're here now, but let's get one thing straight...
Can you hear me?
Every word, darling.
If Frankie finds out about us, I'll break your neck.
Miss Roberts.
It's only me, Miss Roberts. I've brought you some fresh towels.
I'll put them on your bed.
Would you mind handing me one, please?
Thanks.
I could kill you.
- Jeff.
- Yeah?
Something's wrong with the TV.
The phone's been playing up, too.
It must be static because of this heat.
I'll turn it off.
Bloody set.
What's the matter with you?
That's funny. It's never done that before.
That noise again.
Stella, have you been playing around with the telly?
Of course I haven't.
I never touch the thing.
Oh! What was that?
Don't come in, there's glass everywhere.
- What happened?
- Get a dustpan and brush.
- But...
- Get the dustpan.
You don't want the dog getting cut, do you?
Jeff? Look, something's happened and I...
What's that?
I can't shout, I don't want Stella to hear.
But you remember that noise...
I said, remember that noise
I heard on the road?
I'll come over.
Stella, I'm just going to go down to the village.
I'll see if I can get a replacement set.
What a story!
- What?
- You're off to Jeff Callum's.
You men and your horse racing.
We can't keep any secrets from you women, can we?
Hurry up. You'll miss the next race.
Patch!
Patch, come back here!
Patch. Where...
Oh!
Here, Patch, here.
Who told you to come, boy?
You'd better stay, now you're here.
What's the matter, boy?
No!
No!
That's better. This was a good idea of yours.
My fingertips were sticking to the keys.
Some iced coffee will probably help.
Don't you get bored here with the isolation?
Bored?
Yes, I suppose so, at times.
But then, who doesn't?
It's the sort of thing you learn to live with in a place like this.
What happened to
Mr. Callum's last secretary?
Did she get lonely?
Is that why she left?
As a matter of fact, she didn't leave.
Jeff had to ask her to go.
- He sacked her? Why?
- She took a fancy to him.
That made her a complication and
Jeff doesn't like complications.
I can understand.
He's very attractive.
She was wasting her time.
She didn't mean a thing to Jeff.
- Of course.
- I'd have known if she had.
- Do you really think so?
- Yes, I'm sure I would.
But if he were just having fun, would you know?
Jeff doesn't play around.
It'd be all or nothing!
It's a pity that such an attractive man should shut himself away.
It makes you wonder what he's running away from.
What do you mean?
What are you getting at?
A man like that would need a pretty good reason for coming to live in a place like this.
It's obvious he's running away from something.
And it's obvious you don't know him or you wouldn't talk such nonsense!
Oh, but I do. I do.
I'm surprised Jeff hasn't told you about me.
He asked for me personally, didn't you know?
- Are you saying you knew him before?
- Knew him? That's an understatement.
You little bitch! That's not true.
Don't kid yourself he's different.
Men are all the same.
Within half an hour of me arriving, Jeff was kissing me.
I don't believe you. You're lying.
Yes, I am lying.
Why? Why should you lie to me?
I don't know. I was angry.
It's an automatic reflex when I'm being warned off.
You were warning me off?
Yes.
Yes, I suppose I was.
I thought I'd get a bit more written before opening time.
I expected it to cool down by evening, but it's getting hotter.
- Bob never turned up, did he?
- No.
I thought he said he would, just before the phone packed in.
What did he want?
He was on about some noise he'd heard.
Like the one we heard on the beach?
Jeff... You don't mind if I call you Jeff?
- No, not at all.
- You said the noise came from beyond the point.
Is that where the sheep were?
His farm is in that direction.
- Do you think there's a connection?
- Do you, Jeff?
No, I don't.
I'm the one who's paid to use my imagination.
The next chapter. I'd like it finished tonight, if possible.
I'll take my coffee and get the bar ready.
Jeff... May I have a light?
Your hand's trembling.
I'm the same. Feel it beating?
You know you want me.
Why try to deny it?
Quiet.
Listen.
Jeff! Jeff!
Something just landed over by the hill.
I was looking out of the window and it landed in the field.
- What did it look like?
- I couldn't tell.
- There was glow coming from it.
- A glow?
- Did it make a noise?
- That's what drew my attention to it.
A whirring, whining... whining noise.
- It was from that direction?
- Yes, I think so.
Jeff!
- Let's get out of here. I'm scared.
- No. I want to find out who it is.
Hanson! What was he doing up there?
Maybe he saw something land.
He wasn't coming from that direction.
Surely if he saw something, he'd still be there.
Maybe he wouldn't go over the hill.
Maybe it's something even he's scared of.
He's crazy. Whatever he's doing, he's obsessed by it.
Yes. She's right.
If we stay out here, we'll all have nightmares.
- Let's go back.
- Hold it!
You said you saw something.
That's why we came out here.
Did you or didn't you?
Yes... I thought I did.
I thought I saw something coming down.
It seemed to appear over the top of the hill and move slowly down.
But in this heat, I don't know.
Stay here. I'm going to take a look.
Jeff, be careful.
It must've been the other side of that high ground.
Let's get out of here. Wait till tomorrow, when it's light.
You can't leave us here and
I'm not going any further.
All right. But I'll tell you one thing.
I've had enough of
Hanson creeping around.
I'm going to ask him what he's up to.
Hanson, are you in there?
Hanson, do you hear me?
I can't talk now. Go away.
Open this door! Hanson, open this door, or I'll kick it down!
No. Give me a moment.
What are you doing?
What's going on?
Hanson!
Hanson!
The door!
Close the door, you idiot!
What do you think you're doing?
Never mind about me.
What are you up to?
This is my hotel not your bloody laboratory!
I want some explanations,
Hanson. If that's your name.
It is. And I don't owe you any explanation.
You do if you're using my hotel as a centre of your activities.
Were you out there to meet whatever landed tonight?
- Landed?
- You were prowling around out there.
What's this about a landing?
I came to ask questions, not answer them.
Yes, but this landing, what was it?
I assure you I can explain, but this is extremely important.
Well, actually it was my wife who saw it.
- Go on.
- She heard a whirring noise.
When she looked in its direction she saw something glowing.
- Yes?
- And she thought she saw it land.
- Where?
- The other side of the hill.
Do you know what it was?
- Well?
- Yes. Yes, I do.
What was it, Hanson?
I don't expect you to believe this, but for the past week
I've been convinced this island is the centre of an invasion.
A landing point for beings from another planet.
Beings from another planet!
Exactly. That's what has caused this inexplicable heat.
I've heard some yarns from villagers, but your theory is too much.
I'm not a superstitious villager. I'm a scientist.
I base my conclusions on observations of fact.
What do you suppose I'm doing here?
I've been collecting specimens. Soil.
Blood of a sheep. I've been analysing them.
You asked for an explanation, but you're too dim-witted to accept it.
You've ruined everything with your crass stupidity. Here...
Perhaps I shouldn't have broken in like that.
So you've been trying to photograph these things?
I haven't been "trying",
I did photograph them.
I used a normal lens at first, but it was ineffective against the intense light that emanates from these beings.
Remember that parcel you collected for me?
It contained this.
An infra red filter.
I experimented with a special camera and placed it...
Here. I used a mirror reflector and rigged up the shutter to be triggered by anything crossing its line of vision.
- And something did come through?
- Yes, it did!
I was developing the picture when you burst into the room.
It would've given me the proof I so desperately need.
Then what you've told me so far is pure conjecture?
- Cinders?
- Incinerated by whatever was here.
The same happened to the sheep.
They were burned to death.
There's been some sort of incineration, but it doesn't have to be a being from another planet.
I've analysed that, Callum.
It was burned by a high frequency heat, more intense than anything we can produce, even under strict laboratory conditions.
There's only one place where that kind of heat exists.
Out there, where the cosmic gases ferment and generate a heat greater than anything we can imagine.
That's where those beings must come from.
If you're right, how are they getting here? Where are they?
If we knew, we could destroy them before it's too late.
Tell me, has anybody else heard this whirring noise?
Yes, Bob did. In the lane, over by the gravel pits.
Somewhere in this area.
Here, boy. What's the matter?
Callum!
Come on.
I've found it.
Callum, look.
This doesn't affect you at all!
I appreciate how you feel.
I know he was a friend of yours, but that won't do any good now. Look.
Every particle of energy has been sucked out of it.
Hanson... We've got to warn people. They should be told.
No, not yet.
You forced your way in on me.
You had to know, didn't you?
Now you're going to do what I say.
The authorities have dismissed me as a crank, just like you did.
But I must have evidence, and I would've got it if you hadn't destroyed that photograph.
I need time to complete my tests.
- How much time?
- Two or three hours.
As for warning the villagers, we must avoid injecting fear into an already dangerous situation.
Callum, have you noticed something?
This heat, at this time of night it should be getting cooler, but it's building up.
- It's getting hotter, Frankie.
- I think you're right, it is.
- There you are.
- Thanks, my dear.
Oh, what an atmosphere.
They've probably heard about Ben Siddle.
I think I'd better finish that typing, Mrs. Callum.
No wonder the temperature's up.
Who's been hiding her?
Beer, Hanson?
Frankie, pull me a lager.
- Is something wrong?
- No, nothing.
- Jeff, I know you.
- There's nothing wrong!
I'm sorry, it's this damned heat that's making me jumpy.
We've been getting on each other's nerves too.
That's why I came here.
That shows how hot it is.
Smash the bottles! All of them!
- I'll get the first aid kit.
- I'll get it. You'll never find it.
What on earth's going on out there?
The heat exploded the bottles.
It's unbearable, isn't it?
- Here we are.
- Don't touch me.
I only want to put a plaster on your arm.
- Let Ken do it.
- What's the matter?
Let it go, Callum.
This heat is bound to lead to irrational behaviour. I'll do it.
I'll get Dr. Stone.
Come on, Tinker. Back to the pub.
It's all right. Come on. That's it.
It was Tinker.
He jumped me. Come on.
Callum, come here.
Look at the gas cylinder. It's split open, just like the car battery.
Completely drained of every ounce of energy.
Tinker? It's impossible. I can't believe he'd do a thing like that.
Not under normal circumstances, but these are not normal circumstances.
If this heat goes on increasing, it could drive us all insane.
The body isn't equipped for such pressure. The glands will fail.
Then, it's only a matter of time before the brain is affected.
A logical conclusion, but we should keep it to ourselves.
That's what Hanson keeps saying.
Two men have been killed.
- Two?
- Who's been killed?
- How's the girl?
- She's all right.
Who's been killed?
Will someone tell me what's going on?
I'm afraid Tinker's met with an accident.
Jeff, who else is dead?
You mentioned two.
- Bob Hayward.
- Bob! How?
It was an accident.
- Accident? He was...
- Callum, calm down.
These creatures are killing God knows how many, and that's your answer?
Creatures? What do you mean, creatures?
- He shouldn't have told you.
- What do you know that I don't?
He claims we're being attacked by creatures from another planet.
Claims? What do you mean?
You've seen them?
Bob Hayward and Tinker did.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
- Neither do I, Frankie.
- Here.
His thinks the island is being used as a test base for an invasion.
- Don't ask me why.
- It's quite obvious.
They have to discover if they can survive in our atmosphere.
- That's incredible.
- Is it?
We probe space searching for information about other planets.
It's logical that same thing might happen in reverse.
Are you saying that Earth has become a subject of a probe carried out by creatures from another planet?
Yes, I am.
And what I saw land tonight was one of those creatures?
Yes.
One of them, forming a spearhead to find out if life is possible for them on Earth.
And if it is possible?
Then, the main force will come.
Have you any idea what they need to survive?
Heat. The way that car battery and cylinder were split suggests they were seeking heat energy.
- They obviously need it to exist.
- Fine, fine!
We'll just wait for you to complete your tests!
The temperature has risen three degrees in the last half hour. 108.
At this rate, we'll all dead by morning.
I accept that the situation is serious.
The indications are that we're approaching a crisis.
- Hanson!
- Getting emotional won't help.
- We must alert the mainland.
- How?
The telephone's out of action.
What about the Met station? They can send a message. I'll drive up there.
Just a moment, Doctor. This could be very dangerous.
Someone must go. We've lost enough time already.
Very well. But don't go until I come back.
- I'll come with you.
- There's no point both of us going.
You stay and look after the girls.
And Jeff, I should leave that alone.
Too much of it doesn't help in a crisis.
This will help us keep in touch.
Aerial, press to speak, release to receive. Got it?
Yes. Thank you.
Good luck, Doctor.
- And be careful.
- Don't worry, I will.
These creatures, are they likely to attack us?
Depends what they're looking for.
I think they're looking for an energy source to keep them alive.
But once they've found it they'll spread to the mainland.
Yes.
Hello, Hanson.
Are you there, Hanson?
Yes, Stone. I can hear you.
Where are you?
I'm on the road to the point.
I've just passed White's Meadow.
I can see the outline of the
Met station in the distance.
The radiator's boiling up.
She's losing power.
How far is the station?
I'm not sure. About a mile and a quarter I should say.
She's slowing down.
She won't last long. The heat's affecting the engine.
It's very dark out here.
She's pulling badly.
The gravel pit's coming up.
I can make out the entrance.
She's stopping.
It's no good. I'll have to leave her. I'll walk the rest.
Hanson, I'm on the road.
There's a gap in the fence.
It looks like something...
- It's that noise again.
- Get away from there!
Get away! It's your only chance.
I can't hear you! It's this noise!
Stone. Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Get away from that sound.
What's wrong? Isn't it working?
Yes, Mrs. Callum.
The set's working.
It's horrible.
What now?
- It depends.
- On what?
Whether that meeting was an accident or a deliberate interception.
If it was deliberate, it means we're not dealing with brute monsters, but with a superior intelligence.
Which do you think it is?
I don't know, Mrs Callum.
I honestly don't know.
There must be an answer to these things.
We've got to try again.
I'm going this time.
Wait, Callum.
If you go out, you risk sacrificing another life.
The Doctor took the risk.
We can't just leave him there.
No!
I'll have to go.
I'm not being heroic.
Stone was taken by surprise
I'm better equipped to deal with this situation.
He's right, Jeff.
I'll take your Land Rover.
Have you got the keys?
Supposing they're still out there, what will you do?
If they are, I'll have to avoid making the same mistakes as Stone.
Keep these doors locked and that set switched on.
Lock the windows, Frankie.
Angela. It's all right. There's nothing to be afraid of.
I must've had a nightmare.
I kept seeing that man coming towards me.
His hands... I thought...
It's all right, Angela.
It's all right. He's gone now.
There's no need to be afraid.
Come on. Lie down.
I shouldn't think we'll hear from
Hanson yet. It's too soon.
You knew her before, didn't you?
- Who?
- You know who I mean. That girl.
- You knew her before she came here.
- No.
Don't lie to me, Jeff.
I've said I didn't know her.
I saw you kissing her in the study.
That doesn't mean I knew her.
Ever since she came here, you've been tense.
Just as you were before we moved.
Frankie, let it be.
You did know her.
All right, I knew her.
Leave it at that.
It wasn't difficulty with your writing. It was her.
- That why we moved here.
- Drop it, Frankie.
You're overwrought. The heat is affecting us all. Let it go.
Are you in love with her?
Answer me. Are you in love with her?
Not now, Frankie. We're fighting for our lives!
It's important to me. I must know.
Tell me, are you in love with her?
No.
- Then, what is it?
- I wanted her. I wanted her body!
Now you know. She was a slut and I wanted her.
But not any more.
I didn't ask her here.
She's no more than a common slut.
There's no comparison with what I feel for you.
That's why we moved here. It was completely physical, I promise.
She never meant a thing to me. She never will.
Where is everybody?
Where's the doctor?
He's not here. Go back to the study.
Get him! I need him!
He can't come. Go back and lie down.
He should be here. I'm ill.
I need him. Where the hell is he?
He can't come, you selfish bitch! He's dead.
Dead? Dead...
Dead...
Callum. Callum.
This is Hanson. This is Hanson.
He's found the other one.
Can you hear me? Callum?
Can you hear me?
- Why don't you answer?
- I can hear you. Where are you?
I'm at the gravel pit.
I've found Stone's body.
He's dead.
He's burnt to death.
Just like all the others.
The ground here is all scorched.
This is obviously the way they came.
I can see something. Something glowing down in the pit.
It's getting hotter.
I'm going in.
Hanson, remember two people have already died there.
It's horrible. What's he doing there?
It's very dark in here.
I can't see very far.
I can see it again.
It certainly is a light source.
The light seems to be...
I'm not receiving you.
- Hanson, do you hear me?
- Why doesn't he answer?
Hanson!
He's not coming through.
It's a woman!
I'll have to stop her.
Of course. The light!
What are we going to do? What the hell are we going to do?
The area beyond the gravel pit must be their assembly point.
I saw one down there.
What happened? The set went off. Are you all right?
Yes. The aerial must've been screened by the pit.
I've discovered something very important.
They're attracted to light. To them, it's a source of energy.
Turn out all your lights.
Do you hear?
Yes, I hear you. Is there anything else?
No, I'm going on now.
I'll drive without lights.
I'll contact you when
I get to the station.
Thank God he's all right.
He must've seen the creatures themselves.
I wonder how many there are.
I'll get the orange juice.
How long do you think he'll take to get there?
Not long... If he gets through.
He ought to be there by now.
- Why doesn't he contact us?
- Jeff, don't panic, please.
If it's possible to get through, he'll manage.
How do you know? How do you know he's not dead as well?
It's only five miles to the point.
He ought to be arriving any moment.
Intermediate frequency.
Range four...
Four miles? No wonder we haven't heard from him.
If he's at the Met station, he's out of range.
What do we do if he's out of range? Do we just wait?
- I can't stand it another minute!
- I want to get away too.
- We must go to the Met station.
- Anything's better than this.
We'll take your car. I know a short cut. Come on, darling.
I'll drive. I know the way.
We were in the office when the lights blew.
We heard the explosion and found the operator.
We got him to the wardroom but he was dead. Burnt to death.
That explains it. That finally explains it.
Would you mind letting us in on the secret?
Simple. Your station is the means by which these beings got here.
This station?
You must be aware that we've been sending out high frequency impulses to explore space.
Bouncing signals off stars?
Exactly. To us, these impulses are useful, but quite harmless.
But to these beings, they represent a life force.
- I see.
- Do you?
We attracted them, but that doesn't explain how they got here.
It's quite obvious, isn't it?
They must've homed in on your scanner.
These beings are composed of high frequency impulses in heat form.
They transfer like any form of high frequency.
They transferred here like a TV picture, from a transmitter to a receiver.
- Using our scanner as a receiver.
- Exactly.
- Then they materialised on Earth.
- Materialised?
In the same way as a satellite TV picture.
It starts in space as a signal and then materialises.
Do you realise what you're saying?
The Earth's surface is dotted with TV and radar scanners.
If these beings succeed, they'll heat up the whole surface.
Earth will be just another hot planet.
Like so many others in the constellation.
We've got to stop them. We must destroy them before they destroy us.
- Have you got any explosives?
- No.
Just a couple of revolvers and some ammo.
- We've got some flare guns.
- Get them.
Wait, the quarry. There'll be gelignite there.
- Anybody there you can contact?
- Like hell. I'll get it myself.
I'll be glad to apologise if we succeed. I'll take the van.
Whatever you do, don't forget: Drive without lights.
I'm getting to be quite a criminal.
She's slowing down.
She'll blow any moment.
Come on, damn you. Keep going.
It's that noise again.
I can hear it.
- Angela.
- Is she all right?
I missed her. But only just.
She heard you coming and panicked.
Have you seen Hanson?
- He's at the station.
- Good.
They got to us.
- Anyone hurt?
- Yes, the operator. Burnt to death.
Are you all right?
She's put the car in the ditch.
I'll give you a hand.
Here, sit down.
Under the wheel.
Right, start her up.
All right, push.
Put her in reverse.
I'll take Angela with me.
It'll lighten your load.
Right.
- Have you contacted the mainland?
- No.
Here, Frankie.
Here we are.
Fine. Tie them in bundles of three like I told you.
This is the plan. We split up into two groups.
- Is that a good idea?
- It's essential.
You know the hayricks out on the point?
Foster and I will go up there and I'll set fire them.
Wait. You said these creatures were attracted by light.
It'll bring them out into the open.
Foster will intercept them with the dynamite. I'll double back.
- What'll we do?
- Go to the top of the cliff.
As soon as the fires are alight, use the flares to alert the mainland.
- There's nothing else we can do?
- Has anybody got any better ideas?
It'll take us 15 minutes to get to the hayricks.
When you spot my first flare, it's your signal to move.
Foster.
Remember, 15 minutes.
Can you see them?
Why do you think Hanson split us into two groups?
If he and Foster fail, it'll be up to us.
That's what I thought.
He's a peculiar chap, but he's got guts.
Angela seems to be taking it badly.
If things get tough, will you look after her?
- Then I can take care of Frankie.
- Sure.
That's it. Let's go.
Listen.
It's coming from the meadow.
Come on. We must keep going.
- Jeff!
- I'll get her. Take this.
Lightning.
Foster!
Foster, get out of there!
Foster!
You fool. You could've run into them!
Let me go. Let me go!
- Leave me alone. Let me go.
- You'll do as I say.
In there. It'll be safe. Come on.
You little idiot.
Who are you to tell me what to do? It's my life.
You wouldn't stand a chance on your own.
At least we have a chance by sticking together.
I didn't ask you to come after me. Go back.
And leave you here? Oh, no.
Like it or not, I'm staying.
I hate you. Leave me alone.
Look, I'm just as scared as you are.
But... Well, we mustn't give up.
We'll find a way. I know we will.
- How many more flares?
- They're the last.
Whatever happens,
Frankie, stay close.
Callum. The storm, the storm.
Hanson, run for it! Run!
Run!
Aaah!
It's no good. Hanson tried to warn us.
They're all around us.
It's the lightning.
- I can't stand it. I can't...
- Stop it! Stop it!
I don't want to kill you, but I will if I have to. Don't stop me.
- You little fool.
- No, you're the fool.
I'd rather die like this than be burnt alive.
All right. Go on. Do it, but kill me first.
You?
Yes. You're right. It's hopeless, completely hopeless.
So for once, do something for someone else.
Go on, shoot.
Damn you.
What is it with you?
Don't you think I'm old enough to take care of myself?
Look. The rain.
It's killing them.
They're now beginning to pressurize the tanks.
Pressurize all of the tanks in all three stages with gaseous helium.
As the pressurization builds up, it's monitored.
Here in the control center, our status board still indicating all is well.
Network, Flight. You configured for the terminal count?
-Roger, Flight. We're a go.

-Spacecraft systems are a go
-Spacecraft systems are go
-AII spacecraft systems are go
-No mistaking.
-We have CECO
-Roger, CECO.
Hey, it Iooks Iike a fine day down there!
I can see aII the way from GibraItar to Greece
Coming up on the terminator, shouId be in our first sunset in a few minutes
-Loss of signaI with Canary
-Roger, LOS
Okay time to activate TV transmission
We remote to Houston through
Araya, Buzz
Araya One, this is Ironman, how do you copy, over?
Ironman One, Araya I read you loud and clear, copy.
I read you the same
On my mark, TV transmission from camera A
-Mark.
-Smile!
-How are you getting this?
-A little snowy, Ironman.
Clearing up now.
Clear now. Good picture.
Well, say something, Ted.
Are we beautiful?
Ironman, this is Houston
See you reaI good, aII three of you
-How about the other camera, Jim?
-Camera B coming on
Mark
You should be getting me now.
Here's Buzz.
Here's Stoney.
-How's it look?
-Sharp and cIear
How are you for docking with the Iab?
Docking is still planned for the second orbit as advertised.
Roger We have an update on your initiaI phase maneuver
DeIta V, 2 49 at 3 feet per second
This is mission controI, Houston at 22 minutes into the fIight of Ironman One.
After a brief 20-minute fIight across the AtIantic the spacecraft is now crossing the Mediterranean
We begin to Iook at the business of the fIight pIan which shows a rendezvous on docking with the Saturn 4B orbitaI Iaboratory
Buzz, what's our cIosing rate?
-CIosing rate: 50 feet per second
-Roger
-Let me know when we have 25
-Roger
This is mission controI, Houston
Commander Pruett reported compIetion of docking the Apollo at the S-4B Iaboratory
After completing systems checks, the crew will transfer into the lab...
...in which they will live and work for the next seven months.
This will be a test of the spacecraft, the systems and most of all the men.
In preparation for interplanetary deep-space missions...
...which are now being planned.
During this entire period the astronauts will cover their activities...
...with TV cameras, which will be tape-recorded here on Earth...
...for study and evaluation.
WeII, it's not too bad We couId use a coupIe of windows though
I think we're missing the view
What's first, Buzz?
Extra vehicuIar activities in the S-509 maneuvering unit
You take it out
Stoney, you handIe the camera
Watch it, Stoney
Try a IittIe aerobatics here
Here goes
Buzz, how about some work?
Yeah, right
I'm coming right down
Okay, Buzz, micrometeorite experiment
-Say again, Stoney
-Micrometeorite
Roger, micrometeorite
This materiaI was obtained during their first week in space
I am presenting it as a point of reference
Here is Pruett
LIoyd
Stone
We got this day before yesterday
It demonstrates a serious decIine in the abiIity to perform even simpIe manuaI tasks
Just over five months of the mission have been compIeted satisfactoriIy
We wonder if it remains desirabIe to continue for the fuII seven months originaIIy pIanned
-What are your parameters, Courtney?
-EKG, rate and rhythm
-EEG, brain
-He's not sIeeping
The trend shows definite fatigue
-Is he stiII Iosing weight?
-Down 1 6 pounds
The quaIity of the soIar spectraI fiIm's been very poor
-WeII, you're not gonna see any more
-Why not?
Take a Iook at this
Tired and he's making mistakes
You want to try Iiving in a tin can for five months?
-What eIse?
-We got this yesterday
Some further degradations to our CS system:
We've lost a backup coolant loop in the oil thruster.
Oh, yeah.
The washing machine is out.
I was doing some preventative maintenance on it. I shorted it out.
I also discovered some computation errors in the telescope settings.
I guess that accounts for the poor quality in the solar spectral pictures.
I....
I've fixed the razor.
So we can go back to shaving again now.
And I'm sleeping better.
I guess we're all getting our second wind.
And if the hardware holds up, I guess we can make it right to the end.
I know I can.
I think they've done a heII of a job
Bring them down
Yes, sir
Mrs WheeIer, get everyone on the net in mission controI
This is mission controI, Houston
The crew of Ironman One has cIosed down the S-4B space Iaboratory in which they've worked, Iived, sIept and eaten for the Iast five months
Their Apollo spacecraft has separated from the Iab and at this time, the automatic sequence of retrofire is about to begin
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five, four three, two, one, retrofire
The spacecraft shouId be starting its descent across AustraIia towards the spIash point in the Pacific some 400 miIes south of Midway IsIand
They are waiting now for confirmation of retrofire Standing by for contact

-Do you read?
-Go ahead, Houston
Hey, you oId bum How's the run?
We have negative retrofire
Say again, Ironman
Negative, no burn
BaiIey, kiII it
-Ironman, wait one
-What's wrong, Dick?
Don't know
E-COM, GNC, how does the data Iook?
A minute and 20 seconds past retrofire
Ironman, Flight. Would you check your circuit breakers...
...and also your Delta V thrust manual A and B switches?
Roger
GIenn, wouId you punch up channeI six?
-AII parameters are normaI
-Then why in the heII doesn't it fire?
-Houston, Ironman
-Go, Ironman.
Circuit breakers are closed,
SPS switch is on.
Delta V manual A and B switches are on.
Thank you
We're affirming new target
Suggest you try manuaI re-entry on your next pass
Roger, understand manuaI re-entry using RCS backup system
Negative, Jim Negative
We suggest you use the primary system
-We just toId them it didn't work
-Houston we prefer using the backup thrusters
I'm afraid you don't have backup thrusters
-Say again?
-You've fallen too low in RCS fuel.
What about the Iab?
There's oxygen in the Iab
Houston, do we have enough fueI to re-dock with the Iab?
Negative, Ironman Negative
-WeII, what do you propose, Ted?
-You have insufficient RCS fuel.
You're going to have to try retrofire with your primary engine.
Smart boys think your automatic controI system is out but you'II be abIe to get ignition from your primary engine on manuaI command
In other words, kick the box, Jimmy.
-Do you copy, Ironman ?
-Yeah, copy
-Mr Keith, BAO
-No announcement
We shouId say something, sir
We've been off the air--
AII right Just keep it triviaI
Keep it routine
-We may not have a probIem
-Yes, sir
This is mission controI, Houston
We received word from Ironman
One of a maIfunctioning switch that has prevented retrofire on their Iast orbit
They'll bypass the switch. At their next orbit we'll try manual retrofire.
This is Canon in Houston
-Yeah, Canon?
-Unfreeze the dead, wiII you?
-Hold on a second.
-Are you ready now?
-Go ahead.
-Primary engine did not fire on first pass
The secondary thrusters are out
Repeat, out
If that big baby doesn't fire this time, they're not coming back

Ironman, this is Houston Ironman, this is Houston, do you read?
-Go, Houston.
-Do you affirm retrofire?
-Negative
-Say again.
I said, we had negative retrofire
Ironman, this is Keith, do you get any indications from your event Iights?
Boss, we got a IittIe Iight here that says we have retrofired
It's green We're gonna decorate it for Christmas
AII right, Ironman, we're going to work on it
Roger
Cabin pressurization on
We'II be back in a coupIe of hours
Get out of your hot suits
-Roger
-See you later.
We'II be here
I want a compIete tape dump from aII sites I want it pIayed back here
And I want it in strip charts
CaII Sacco, teII him to put an engine in the simuIator
Feed it aII the TM we've got and see what keeps it from firing
Hard copies of everything and an oxygen projection
Yes, sir
Mr Keith?
-Forgot aII about them
-Ted, wiII you get them out of here?
-Ben, take this
-Right
No retrofire
They're stiII up there
It'II take a IittIe time to psych out the engine
WeII, I guess it's time to go home and
Iight the fires and mind the kids
Do you need a Iift?
-Did you taIk to them?
-Yeah
They're fine
For how Iong?
-WeII, we'II be in touch, Mrs Stone
-Thank you, but--
I'd aIso Iike to know what's happening
Teresa, CeIia and I have been in this business 1 0 years
We Iearned the best thing is for us girIs to keep our feeIings to ourseIves
And Iet the men get on with their jobs
-Right, CeIia?
-Wrong, Betty
It's been 1 5 years
Morning, Iadies and gentIemen
Sorry that I've kept you waiting
-Dr Keith, are you--?
-Mr Keith
-Are you on your way to Washington?
-No
-Spoken to the White House yet?
-No
TeII me, sir, who's responsibIe for withhoIding the news?
-Oh, I'm the responsibIe officer
-Do you have a statement, Mr Keith?
No, but I wouId Iike to say that approximateIy 1 5,000 peopIe are trying to isoIate and correct this maIfunction
Every resource of the NASA and our industriaI contractors is being used to the fuIIest
-Mr Canon
-Let me get this straight:
-The spacecraft is stiII in orbit, right?
-Yes
Going around the worId every 94 minutes, right?
That's right, Mr Canon
How much oxygen does the crew have for Iife support?
They're in no immediate danger
-There's a rumor the men are dead
-Not true
Mr Henry?
What happens if you can't get the engine to retrofire?
We're prepared for every contingency,
Mr Henry
What happens if you can't get the engine to fire?
Does the spacecraft continue circIing around the Earth untiI orbitaI decay sIows it down sufficientIy for it to re-enter the atmosphere?
If so, does the spacecraft and everything in it get burnt to a crisp
-is that right?
-WeII, what's your point?
How Iong before that happens, five years?
Seven years
Have you given up hope, Mr Keith?
CertainIy not, Mr Canon
Why shouId I?
If you'II excuse me now, pIease
Strawberry cereaI cubes
Soup, corn, cream
Jim, why are we just Iying here waiting, huh?
For Ground to anaIyze the entire teIemetry
So some smart-ass engineer can teII us we're out of Iuck?
Why not go EVA?
We'II check the engine ourseIves
Maybe one of the fueI vaIves is frozen
No, Ground couId teII that
Maybe we took a meteor strike Maybe something hung up on separation
Just reIax
Eat your chicken whiIe it's hot
What are you Iooking at, Stoney?
A disturbance in the inner-tropicaI conversion zone
Somebody's gonna have a hurricane
-Where's the center, Stoney?
-It's just northeast of Cuba
Yeah, nice thick cIouds, good east-west sIope
Looks Iike cIouding circuIation's just beginning
She's gonna be a big beast
AIma, first of the season
Houston, this is Simulator.
We have on the stand SPS engine unit H37 modified block four.
This unit is an exact one-to-one duplicate...
...of the primary equipment in Ironman One
We have analyzed the engine telemetry.
And we're attempting to construct a configuration...
...which will reproduce the conditions that prevented ignition.
Three, two, one
Firing the engine
I say, apparently we have failed to prevent ignition.
But we'll keep working on it.
AII right, the president's waiting for our recommendations
AII right, the president's waiting for our recommendations
One, a statement to be issued at the concIusion of this meeting:
''Every effort is being made to discover and correct the spacecraft maIfunction in accordance with contingency pIans designed to meet such emergencies''
Two, a report to be issued
Tuesday morning by the director of manned space fIight
Emphasizing the high degree of safety and success in the program thus far
The accident wiII be compared to the faiIure of an experimentaI aircraft
It'II be noted that in the deveIopment of such aircraft a 1 0 percent piIot Ioss is considered acceptabIe
Now, Wednesday morning, if necessary the president wiII issue an appropriate message to the nation
Emphasizing the courage and determination of the crew
And their finaI wish, that the program be continued without pause
Discussion?
Yeah, I have something
I want to taIk about a rescue mission
I'm speaking for the piIots and some of the Air Force boys
We propose Iaunching a rescue craft using one of their boosters
Rendezvous with Ironman, transfer crew and return to Earth
Dougherty, you haven't been Iistening
Courtney, wiII you repeat that trend data on oxygen consumption in the spacecraft?
As of now, they're going to Iive another 42 hours
PIus or minus two percent Now, that takes us up to 1 0:30 Monday night
There's a Iaunch window for a shot at 8:48 Monday night
Nothing to put in that window
An Air Force Titan 3C Ieft Denver for the Cape one hour ago
Oh, actuaIIy it was aIready in the pipe
And aIso the XRV Iifting body from Edwards
Can you get the Titan and an XRV
-on the pad ready to go in 42 hours?
-Some of our boys think they couId
A non-man-rated booster and a craft that's never fIown
Oh, it'II fIy aII right, and Dougherty here has aII the quaIifications
ProposaI is rejected
Anything eIse?
Yeah, what do I teII the piIots?
TeII them that the request is outside the area of their competence
-We've got three men dying
-They're professionaIs
If they were here they'd say,
''Take what you've Iearned
Get on with the next mission''
I don't give a damn about the next mission!
There's no room in this program for a chief astronaut who cannot Iook at the whoIe picture
Then you fire me
You want to Iaunch a rescue mission in 42 hours--
AII right
One: AssembIe and check out booster stage one, stage two and trans stage
How Iong, on past performance?
WeII, on past performance, 1 2 days, but if we were--
TweIve days
Two: BuiId up and strap on soIid fueI stacks
-Four days, but we can--
-Four days
Check Iaunch weather for Monday night There's a hurricane out there
600 miIes off the coast and headed out to sea
WeII, you're in Iuck Three: Make the vehicIe to the bird and check out configuration
How Iong, coIoneI?
-Bob?
-We haven't any accurate way
-to determine the minimum time--
-CouIdn't do it under five days
Four: Compute navigation and guidance tapes for first apogee rendezvous,
1 0 days Program computers
-three weeks
-We'II go without a computer
-We'II go without a checkup
-And crew training in a craft which has not been man-rated, which cannot be fIown by one piIot and which has not been modified to hoId four men
How about that one?
They'II do it in 42 hours
WhiIe you're assembIing your rescue ship in 42 hours and spending--
How much wouId that cost, Fisher?
-Fifty miIIion
-So what?
PIus how many deaths?
-Jimmy?
-In a program of this magnitude in which aII nominaI safety factors are disregarded
I caIcuIate 02 percent of the workforce--
How the heII do you know how many peopIe wiII die?
Think we haven't considered rescue?
Here it is
Rescue and every other contingency
Reduced to digitaIs and computerized
You heIped to write it
-A rationaI approach
-WeII, screw your rationaI approach
Three of your piIots are in troubIe
And if you don't try to get them down, weII, God damn you!
WeII, you have feeIings Good
I have feeIings
That's why we Iive by the ruIes
WheeIer Courtney
Fisher KIein
Degrote
Those men up there are your friends
Can you Iaunch a rescue mission in 42 hours?
-Yeah, aII right
-Are you ready to talk to him now?
-We're ready at this end
-The president will take your call...
-...at 7:00 our time.
-Very good
The president wiII take the caII at 7:00 his time
That Ieaves us an hour and 1 5 minutes
-Your Iicense, pIease--
-Officer, I'm a government officiaI
-I'm in a hurry
-I can see that
Here's security, Q cIearance, top secret
You've got a Iot on your mind, aII right That's how it happens
-You forget where you are and wham
-I've got to get to a teIephone
Shut off your engine
I'm CharIes Keith, head of Manned Space
I know who you are
BS G-2896553, another code three,
Charles Raymond Keith.
You have no brake Iights
Your Iicense is expired
You may get to the moon, but you're a menace on the road
-Are you CharIes Raymond Keith?
-Yes!
Somebody named OIympus wants to taIk to you
Can you patch me into command network, Baker to OIympus?
Keith, where are you?
Mr President, I have a sort of a probIem here
What do you have for me?
WeII, we're anaIyzing the engine teIemetry
We've got a contractor running a simiIar engine in a faiIure mode, and we're running down the history of aII the hardware in the spacecraft
What else can you do besides what you're doing?
I don't think there's anything eIse
Have you fellas considered rescue?
Yes, we've discussed it, of course
What do you think?
WeII, sir, it's a very, very remote possibiIity
Charles, can I talk to you as a friend?
WeII, yes, sir, of course
You're right, and for the right reasons.
But if we do it your way, 200 million people are going to start raising hell.
WeII, Mr President, it's not my way
There is data and there are certain facts that we have to deaI with
Charles, just put away your slide rule for a minute and listen.
There's more going on here than logic.
The world is watching us and what we do...
...about rescuing these men.
To say that there's nothing we can do...
...is going to be disaster for me, for you and for your program.
We have to take a crack at it with the very best we've got.
Now, what do you say, Charles?
Mr President, it'II be a dangerous gambIe, but we'II go if you say so
You let me know how you're doing and what you need.
Whatever you want, you've got it.
--confirmed tonight that the SPS engine failed to fire...
...leaving America's three astronauts in orbit...
...some 285 miles above the Earth, circling the globe every 9 4 minutes.
They are now approaching the west coast of Africa.
No word has been issued as to the cause of the malfunction...
...beyond the statement made by
Dr. Keith at the news conference...
...held this morning in--
--that contingency plans have been developed...
...to meet every conceivable emergency.
It has been reported from mission control in Houston...
...that the three astronauts are--
Okay, Buzz, you're right
To heII with waiting for a bunch of sIide-ruIe jockeys
We used to fix the airpIanes we fIew with paper cIips
Let's get into our hard suits and fix this bird
-Okay, Jimmy
-You watch the store, wiII you, Stoney?
Yeah, go
-Ironman One this is Houston Flight.
-Go, Houston
We're coming up to get you, Ironman.
Say again.
We're coming to get you.
We're launching a rescue mission from the Cape.
We're using a Titan 3C with an XRV lifting body modified to hold four men.
The pilot is Ted Dougherty.
Do you read, Ironman ?
Yeah, yeah, we read you.
Houston, when do you estimate
Iaunch?
Just over 40 hours, Stoney
Forty hours? Who are they kidding?
Do you read, Ironman?
We've decided to make a move up here
Go EVA and eyeball the engines.
The fuel valves could be frozen.
We'll pull the insulating hatches.
If they are...
...we'll get in the sun and get some heat on them.
That's an interesting thought, but we have no indication
...of that here or anything else you could correct.
We're all agreed the rescue mission is it.
We're agreed we have to take affirmative action to repair our vehicIe
Ironman, stand by one
TeII them negative, Jimmy, negative
Jim, we appreciate your desire to take affirmative action...
...and we need your affirmative action if the mission is to succeed.
The most criticaI factor is your oxygen suppIy
To get 1 5 minutes of activity outside the spacecraft...
...to eyeball the engine, you have to trade off...
...three or four hours of passive breathing.
From where we sit you don't have that oxygen to spare.
Therefore, we'd like to suggest that you go into low-tide mode...
...lower your oxygen pressure to 3.5...
...execute a full emergency power down... and take your piIIs
They want us to buy it whiIe we're sIeeping
Do you copy, Ironman?
Yeah We're thinking about it
TeII them negative, Jim, negative
Pruett, now, this is Keith
I'm down here at the Cape with SadIer and we're getting this rescue shot ready to go
Don't do anything fooIish
Don't cIimb into your hard suits
Don't get out your tooIs and don't try to fix the engine
Just take your piIIs and go to sIeep
Can you get us down, boss?
We've got a better chance than you do
-We'II be back at you
-Roger.
Yeah, he's Iying
Buzz, you eat up 25 percent more oxygen every time you Iose your cooI
Houston, Ironman, preparing for power down
Roger, Ironman
What are the numbers, Stoney?
WeII, with nominaI oxygen usage,
I make it 36 hours Ieft
Take out the pad, 40 hours, more or Iess
How you figuring the residuaI amounts in the tanks?
How wouId you?
Yeah, you'd have to breathe them dry to find out
No one's ever done that
Yeah, weII, I got the feeIing we just may be the first
Royce Fitzgerald, call 1 0-993.
Resume count-off, my mark at minus 2 40.
Mark.
PuII the GNN circuit breakers and the IMU heater breakers
Circuit breakers off
Shut down the attitude controI system
SCS secured
Shut down number two and three fueI ceIIs
We'II Ieave one on the Iine in case we have to charge
Two and three off
What about the comm?
No, we'II Ieave it on
FIood Iights off
EL off
Buzz, are the Iower equipment bays dark?
The B Iights are off
Then why isn't that off?
I don't know why
Houston, Ironman
-We're cranked down.
-Copy, Jim
We'II check in when you come over the hiII at Guaymas
We're gonna keep you informed every step of the way
Get some sIeep now
-In a whiIe
-Jim, this is Courtney
I want you to take one tablet of Stryzene after every meal...
...and one when you complete power down.
You can drink as much water as you want.
Every word, every emotion costs oxygen...
...so the more relaxed you are, the better.
All right, you bums, take your pills and go to sleep.
Hey! HeIIo, big brother
-Hey, Ted
-Hi, Stoney.
Hey, where are you?
What's aII the racket?
WeII, I'm in HuntsviIIe, kIuging up a simuIator to the XRV
Say again?
A simuIator to the XRV
I'm gonna do a IittIe pressure up here before I take it to the Cape
This is a great time to start Iearning how to fIy it
AII you guys gotta worry about is where you want me to set you down after I make the transfer
Go on, pick your spot.
Edwards, Vegas, how about the beach in Malibu?
Why not?
AII right, take your piIIs, go to sIeep and Ieave the driving to us
I'II see you in 39 hours and 1 6 minutes
Simulation will begin in 1 0 minutes.
Maintain RF silence until further notice.
How does it Iook to you?
The XRV wiII Ieave in two hours, be on the pad in five
That gives you nine hours
You're not gonna make it
We've got eight separate systems to verify
-I don't know how to do it any faster--
-Here
That's how you're gonna do it
CoIoneI, you've got automatic backups designed into aII your systems
Now you're gonna find out if they work
Range 6-5, range 2-4
A little under.
Three-point-four second vert
Range 6-3, range 2- 1.
Missed his target by 20 miIes
CoI Dougherty, you've overshot
Yeah, I know
I missed it by 20 miIes
Is it possible to break down the program into segments...
...to repeat DPI to rendezvous?
No, we don't have the time to break up the tapes
Okay.
Can we recycIe fast time from Iaunch to first DeIta V
...and real time from then?
Okay, wiII do
AII right, Iet's go again
The tape is ready.
On my mark, first DeIta V burn
Three, two, one, ignition
Roger, I have ignition
Timer on and counting
We have a new APT, and it's not good
-It's turned
-Sure has
How soon wiII it get here?
What do you think?
Eight hours, major
Seven, maybe eight
It's gonna be a tight fit
AII right
Keith speaking
Yes, okay Okay
-HeIIo, Mr President?
-The hurricane.
WeII, it changed course
Eighty-miIe winds heading straight for us
WeII, we can Iaunch in winds up to 45 miIes per hour
Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure, sir
I wrote it
No, they can't heIp us
I've aIready taIked to them
I know Kashvin pretty weII
You see, their Voshkod's in the wrong orbit, won't wash
We can't Iaunch any earIier, sir
We have to go preciseIy at 8:48
Well, what are you gonna do?
We just keep going
Keep pIugging
Deep, dreamIess sIeep
That's a nice adjustment
Nightmare?
He's an angry, active guy
Frustrated He's heIpIess
-Can we give him something to do?
-No
He's not taking his piIIs
He's got a Iot to think about
The sIeep period shouId be terminated
AII right, but teII mission controI not to keep him busy
-Kid him aIong, keep him informed
-Yes, sir
Houston CapCom, this is Courtney
This is Houston, CapCom, Frank Piro
Frank, wake them up
And, Frank, Mr Keith does not want you to try to keep them busy
Just keep them informed, kid them aIong
Understood
The sIeep period is terminated
Hi, feIIas! We see you're awake now
Thought we'd bring you up to date on mission status
The soIid stacks are being strapped on and we'II be moving the bird on the pad in about nine hours
Say, here's a IittIe item of space news
The Russians have just Iaunched another Voshkod.
Would you believe it's carrying a
Red Army all-girl marching band?
Say, you guys still asleep?
No, we're having a wiId party
Hey, that's pretty funny.
You sure you're taking your quiet piIIs?
We are, but the girIs aren't
Well, have fun.
Roger, Houston
You never wind down, do you, Stoney?
No, never do
I just do the job I was trained for:
I observe systems under stress
Okay
I'II give you some data points
You know what I'm thinking now?
I'm thinking I never made enough money in this business
How do some of those piIots make so much money?
I don't have a dime
Are you getting aII that?
Yeah Yeah, getting aII that
I'II teII you something eIse
I'II never get the Mars shot
You know why? I'm too oId
How about that?
Why are you doing that?
-ReIax, Buzz
-Don't teII me what to do
Hey, Buzz, you
You remember that psychoIogist at Brooks?
The one with the bIank sheet of paper?
I don't remember
Sure Sure, you remember
He heId up a bIank sheet of paper and said:
''What do you see?''
-I don't remember
-What did you see?
Who, me?
I saw a bIank sheet of paper
No imagination
No, no Devotion to truth
Why don't you take that PhD and shove it?
What are you gonna do when you finish that?
Drop it out the window in a bottIe?
No, I'm the scientist
I reIy on the piIot to get me pIaces
If we'd had a coupIe more piIots, we'd be out there instead of Iaying here
Jim, what did you see when the psychoIogist heId up the paper?
They didn't have aII that jazz when I came in
I saw a fieId covered with snow
And underneath, there was new oats
And then the snow meIted, and the fieId turned to green
But the psychoIogist said I was wrong, it was just a bIank sheet of paper
They took you anyway?
Yeah, I guess they made a mistake
No, no They don't make mistakes
That's right, I forgot
They don't make mistakes, do they?
Ironman One.
Ironman One, Goldstone, do you read?
Yeah Go, GoIdstone
You might want to look out your window, Jim.
What for?
There's somebody down there that wants to say something to you.
Say again?
Why don't you look out your window?
That's San Diego, Jim.
Your hometown, saying hello.
Suspended beneath the Air Force CA3 helicopter...
...the XRV is on its way to the launch pad.
A flying wedge, shaped much like a thick arrowhead...
...the XRV has never before been in space.
When it makes its first flight, Col.
Dougherty will be going it alone...
...because that bird was designed for two men...
...but now has been modified, of course, to carry four men.
CoI Dougherty wiII be on his way to bring home the three astronauts of Ironman One.
That XRV will plunge into the atmosphere...
...at 1 7,000 miles per hour, a flaming meteor coming back to Earth.
When it breaks down into the lower atmosphere...
...the speed will drop to only a few hundred miles per hour...
...and Dougherty will be flying a high-speed glider...
...an airplane without power.
He'll take that bird straight in towards
Edwards Air Force Base...
...to land on the long runway out there in the California desert.
HeIIo, Ted
Thirty-six hours and 1 5 minutes
Great, Ted
-What about the hurricane?
-Heading straight for us
-When did it turn?
-About six hours ago
-When do we get it?
-75-knot winds by 9:00
-They said it was headed to sea
-They were wrong
How in the heII can they make a mistake Iike that?
Stop wasting your energy It changed course once, it can change again
How are the chiIdren, Teresa?
Fine
Mine are home studying for exams
Boy, they sure are putting the pressure on at schooI these days
It'II just be a minute
I shouId caution you
You're going to notice some degeneration
But it's important to show them how confident you are
We understand, Dick
We won't Iet you down
You want us to be confident?
The more reIaxed they are, the Iess oxygen they use
I know why we're here
You're Ietting us say goodbye
Wyman's report to contact.
CeIia?
-Hi, CeIia
-Hi, Frank
Celia?
It's Jim
-Frank, take it off for a minute
-AII right
Celia?
CeIia
CeIia, we're gonna taIk to him on the monitor up here
Celia.
WeII, here I am again
Celia?
WeII everybody's been so nice
I spoke to your father today
And he says to say heIIo
His coId, it seemed better
I bought some new shoes
They hurt
And the kids?
Oh, fine, fine
I Iost the biII to the insurance
I thought I had it paid, and then just this morning, I got a Ietter
Listen, babe, I....
I just want to tell you that I love you.
What?
I said, I love you.
I just wanted you to know.
I know that
I just wanted to make sure.
Is it very IoneIy where you are?
No, not for long.
We aII have great confidence
Celia, if you have any more problems with the insurance...
...or the house or anything like that...
...you can talk to Dougherty.
He's a good guy.
You can depend on him.
I gave him a kiss to give you when he sees you
Yeah, that's just what I need.
You never can teII
-Well, I gotta go now.
-No, not yet
CeIia, I
I had a reaI good day today
And you know, when you think about this
I want you to remember
I had a reaI good day
Jim?
We better cut it off now
Oh, there's one more thing that I have to teII you
I Iost five pounds Iast week
I can't wait tiII you see me
You take care of yourself.
Take care
Hi, sport
Hiya, kid.
How are the mice?
Well, we're learning something every day.
You writing a big, duII book up there?
No No, a smaII, duII book
How are you?
I'm working on a IittIe project
I've deveIoped an experimentaI hypothesis for you to proof out
Have you? WeII, what is it?
I miss you Iike mad
Yeah
Your paper came out Iast week
Professor Stavel said it's a brilliant presentation.
It was the best he's ever read.
We're gonna make it, Teresa
What?
-We're gonna make it back
-What?
We're gonna make it back.
-I know
-Believe me.
-Yes
-I mean it, we're all coming back
Listen, Teresa, I....
I want you and the kids to
Look, I have to go now
-I'II be seeing you
-Stoney
I'll be seeing you.
No, no
I Iove you, remember that
Remember that
Buzz?
Yeah?
GeneraI LeCIair caIIed aII the way from CIark's FieId
-I thought that was so nice
-Yeah.
They want to give you something, a scroII or--
Look, hon you don't seem to understand, it's aII faIIing apart up here
You understand?
I understand, Buzz
You see...
...I broke the washing machine, and now I can't fix it.
I understand how you feel.
I could fix it if they'd give me the tools.
But they won't
Listen, honey, I wrote something.
We're all gonna sign it.
-Do you want to hear it?
-What?
''To the president, the White House,
Washington D. C.:
Dear Mr. President...
...we just wanted to let you know how much we appreciate... the heroic action to save our husbands
We are gratefuI to you and to everyone in the nation
The team effort of the past two days will be an inspiration to us...
...our children and our--''
Don't you understand? It's aII faIIing apart and they're bIaming me
I don't feeI very good
Buzz
I have to go now
I love you. I'll see you later.
Can you give me a reading on your partiaI pressure of carbon dioxide?
Thank you, Dick
I'II be aII right
I just gave you that!
Negative, Buzz
Negative, you gave me a PS--
What difference does it make?
What's going on down there?
Why don't you get us out of here?
Get ahoId of him, Jim
Keep him away from the controIs!
-Get us out--
-Sedate him, Jim, sedate him
Buzz?
Come on Buzz
Now just get us out of here, that's all! Come on!
Come on! Leave me alone!
Don't kiII me!
Don't kiII me!
It's not my fauIt!
Why'd you bring in his goddamn wife?
Keep him sedated, keep him away from the controIs
Do you understand me?
You just get Dougherty off the pad
He's tired, that's all.
Everybody's tired.

I'm sorry, we had to scrub the Iaunch
Yeah
I figured it might be Iike that, we've been watching the storm
How close did you get?
T-minus 60 seconds
Now Iisten, Jim, we're stiII working on that engine
Boss...
...I just-- I wanted to tell you...
...that you've done a great job, all of you.
We know that you've all worked your tails off for us...
...and whatever happens to us, you can't let it affect the program.
You've done a great job, really...
...and, you know, whatever it is that's hanging us up, it's nobody's fault.
GBI reports loss of signal.
Ascension will acquire the spacecraft, shall we remote you through?
Nope
Move in, white room
Get the piIot out of there
-Ted
-Wait
-I want to speak to Keith
-I'm here, Ted
We've done everything we possibIy couId We cannot Iaunch
I'm telling you to launch! You get this haywagon off the ground!
Now launch, damn it, Keith, launch this thing!
Keith!
Keith!
I have a brief statement
The Iaunch of the XRV rescue craft was scrubbed at 8:4 7, Cape time
The pad was shut down at T-minus 58 seconds when the wind veIocity in the Iaunch area rose to 48 knots
Commander Pruett in the Apollo
Command Module has been informed
This
This was a very fine, fine effort
Do you have any questions?
Mr Keith, you say that the Iaunch has been scrubbed
Are you going to rescheduIe at a Iater time?
We have no pIans
-Any future rescue attempts?
-We have no pIans
Mr Keith, you say the men have been informed Who informed them?
I did
What was their reaction?
Do you have any other questions?
There's an assumption that the space program wiII be brought to a haIt for an investigation of the accident pIus a generaI examination of our purposes in space and the moraIity of putting men into space without adequate--
What's your question?
Are the resuIts you gained worth the Iives you Iost?
You're damn right they are!
Know what they accompIished Iiving up there in a tin can for five months?
Because of men Iike these, we've taken the first step off this IittIe pIanet
The moon trip was a waIk around the bIock
We're going to the stars, to other worIds, other civiIizations
Mr Keith?
Men wiII be kiIIed in this effort just as they're kiIIed in cars and airpIanes and bars and-- What is it?
-Look at the numbers
-What about them?
The numbers, Mr Keith, the numbers!
-In God's name
-What is that?
In this disturbance, we have 90-knot winds
In the center, or eye, we have zero
The eye of the hurricane wiII pass over the Cape
AII I wish to hear from each of you is yes or no Go or no go
Do we have a Iaunch window whiIe the eye's over the Cape?
We affirm a Iaunch window at 2231 :06
Can you Iaunch your rocket through the eye?
-Yes, sir
-WiII the bird fIy?
WeII, it's been kicked around by 80-knot winds
-The data's--
-What's your judgment?
It'II fIy
-Carp?
-Yes, sir?
-Do we have 1 6 minutes in the eye?
-No, sir, not 1 6
Do we have 1 4?
We've been trying to get a chart from the computer--
What's your judgment?
I'II buy 1 4
Can we move the tower back in 1 2 minutes?
You give the order and we'II do it
Houston, FIight
Is the rescue craft go for Point CharIie?
We can have Point CharIie, but then piIot wiII be on his own
Rescue, can you rendezvous without an onboard computer program?
You just get me in the baIIpark
Then we are go for Iaunch at 2231 :06 IocaI time
Roger, 2231 :06 IocaI time
Roger, 2231 :06 IocaI time
We'II recycIe to T-minus 30
You know, of course, that by
2231 :06, the crew wiII be dead
There's not enough oxygen Ieft for three men to Iive that Iong
What about two men?
We don't figure that way, we pIot totaI pressure against totaI use
Is there sufficient oxygen for two men?
For one?
Two might just make it
-Go!
-Move back service tower
This is launch control, we have just resumed the count.
Col. Dougherty has confirmed...
...that all spacecraft systems are go at this time.
Launch director is about to feed the computer update to the spacecraft.
This is an unbeIievabIe scene
No wind, absoIute siIence
Overhead nothing but bIack night and briIIiant stars as the eye of the Hurricane AIma passes directIy over us
There's an eerie hush over everything here
No rain, no wind
The Iives of three men are measured by their fading heartbeats and here on pad 41 at Cape Kennedy we're in the middIe of another heartbeat
It's a singIe moment in the Iife of a great storm reprieve, we hope, for Pruett, LIoyd and Stone
The service tower is roIIing away from the Iaunch pad
As soon as it's 800 feet away it'II be Iocked into position but they'II Iaunch before that happens
That tower is expendabIe but the three men in Ironman One are not

Rescue, Flight. We show you right on the money. Go get them, kid.
Cause of death wiII be anoxia
You know, that's an interesting way to go
The brain gets starved for oxygen
Ironman One, this is the Cape.
Do you read?
Just before the end you feeI great and then you Iaugh it up
When you're ready to start singing and shouting bIackout
Ironman One, this is the Cape.
Do you read?
You know, that's an interesting mechanism
There's not much data on that either
Ironman One, this is Carnarva.
Do you read?
Ironman One, Redstone, do you copy?
Ironman One, Houston CapCom, do you read?
Ironman One, Houston CapCom, do you read?
Ironman One, this is Houston Flight, do you read me?
Ironman, this is Keith.
What the heII do they want?
Hello, Jim, I want to talk to you.
Yeah, what do you want?
I have some numbers for you
The eye of the hurricane passed over the Cape at 22 1 8 and we had a second window at 2231 :06, Cape time
We've successfuIIy Iaunched the rescue craft through the eye
...do you understand?
You have Iaunched the XRV?
Yes, that's correct, the XRV has compIeted staging
...and is on its way to rendezvous.
Our transfer will be at 2328.
That's 55 minutes from now, do you read?
Yeah, I read
Jim, how do you evaIuate the oxygen situation?
WeII, we have whatever oxygen's
Ieft in the spacecraft system and there are onIy two bottIes of emergency oxygen onboard five minutes each, that's 1 0 man-minutes
My backpack and LIoyd's and Stone's but there's not much oxygen
Ieft in them
WeII, you'II have to save your backpacks for the EVA transfer
Yeah, I know that
Fifty-five minutes
We'II be dead by then
WeII, onIy if you continue to use oxygen at the present rate
Well, we can't cut down.
Let's think about that
You want us to Iower the partiaI pressure again?
No, we've examined that.
It won't work.
WeII, we're Iying here
Iike corpses now
What eIse can we do?
You must think
Yeah, we're thinking
Are we taIking about the same thing?
Yeah
Why don't you taIk it over?
If you couId work out something, it wouId be a great heIp
Yeah, we'II taIk it over
I must point out that any effective action must be taken immediately.
Look, don't teII me what to do!
We've been taking your damned orders and where the heII are we?!
From now on we're gonna make aII of the decisions!
Whatever we do, you're out of it!
I appreciate what you're saying, Jim and I agree with you, you're exactIy right
Yeah, anything else?
No, that's aII at the moment
WouId you pIease give me those Iaunch numbers again?
Yes, that's Iaunch at 2231 :06, Cape time rendezvous and transfer at 2328
Thanks
Launch at 2231 :06, rendezvous 2328
-That's what they say
-Fifty-five minutes to go
Through the eye of a hurricane
Jesus, 55 minutes
-Right
-We'II be pretty coId by then
WeII one of us is gonna have to go
I mean that's what we're taIking about, isn't it?
One of us goes and the other two stay
WeII what are we gonna do?
Look, Iet's do it scientificaIIy
Two big guys throw the IittIe guy out, okay?
Yeah, weII that's an idea
We're gonna have to taIk about this
So, what are we gonna do?
I couId do it by chance
I'II tear out strips from a pad
One short, two Iong
The guy with the short end goes
Yeah
Oh, Jesus, we can't do that
No, we can't do that
WeII Iook, I don't want to just Iay here and die
AII right, then figure the odds
Two guys, three guys, is that much difference?
I say doubIe the piIIs
No moving, no taIking, puIse way down
Even when there's no pressure there's oxygen moIecuIes fIoating around
You Iive for a whiIe even when there's no pressure in the gauges
For God's sake, it's Iess than 55 minutes!
-You're dreaming, Stone
-AII right, okay
I'II go
I'm the weakest, I'm using up the most oxygen, I'II go
It's aII right
AII right, aII right
AII right, get your heImets on
I'm going out to fix the engine
Are you kidding?
You can't fix that engine
What the heII do you know about it?
I don't know why I Iet them taIk me out of it
I shouId've done this two days ago
Come on, get your heImets on
He'II fix it
He's good, he'II fix it
You son of a bitch You know what he's doing up there
-Buzz, don't!
-Jim!
-Get back in here
-Jim, don't do it!
You're going to rip out the umbiIicaIs
Jim, don't do it Jim!
Jim
Jim, don't do it Jim!
Stoney Stoney, give me some Iine here
-Stoney?
-We can't get to him
Yes?
Mrs Pruett, I wanted to taIk to you
Mrs. Pruett... your husband is dead.
It was an accident
He was trying to repair the spacecraft
I'm sorry
Jim?
Jim?
I toId you, Jim's not here
He had an accident.
Where's Stoney at?
I'm here
Stoney?
Dougherty's coming
Stoney, teII Jim to get us out of here
Stop eating your oxygen, damn you!
Be stiII!
Range 7 6.8.
I've got to hit it.
I'm a little under the line.
Rescue, Flight.
Do you confirm burn attitude?
-Roger, attitude is go, Delta V 63.
-Roger, Ted, this is the one.
Roger, three, two, one.

Can't Can't, gotta save it for the transfer
I'm dying
-I'm dying
-No, you're not dying
It takes a Iong time to die
Ironman, this is Rescue
Ironman, this is Rescue
-Read you
-Turn on your acquisition lights.
Say again?
Come on, Stoney, turn on your acquisition Iights
Roger Roger, acquisition Iights
Okay, Stoney, I'm coming right down the pipe. I'll see you in six minutes.
Six minutes, roger
Buzz, six more minutes.
Only six more minutes, Buzz.
-I can't
-You can, Buzz You've got to
-I can't
-You can, Buzz Think of something
Think of....
Think of the Earth, Buzz.
Look at the Earth, Buzz
Look, can you--?
Can you teII where we are?
Stoney?
AII right, Buzz
AII right
AII right, Buzz, you're on my air now
Take a breather.
I'm going back on cabin air.
There must be some left.
Ironman, this is Keith
Ironman, this is Keith, do you read me?
Purpose and objective
Ironman One, this is Keith, do you read?
Purpose and objective
Ironman, this is Keith, do you read me?
Purpose:
The acquisition of

Ironman, do you read me?
No
Oh, God
Oh, God
How beautifuI
I'm beginning to see visions
Stoney, come in. of death
There you are
Ironman, this is Keith.
Ironman, a Russian spacecraft is making rendezvous with you.
Do you see a Russian spacecraft? Come in.
Stoney, do you see a Russian spacecraft?
I see him
Good Now 30 minutes ago he made a change in orbit
He is moving towards you for rendezvous
We don't know what he's going to do
All you can do at this point is watch him.
Watch him. Stoney, do you read me?
He
He's stopping
He's opening up
He's coming out
He wants me to do something
I think he wants me to open the hatch
Stoney, what is your oxygen readout?
Your oxygen readout?
Oh, it's zero-zero
No, no No, that--
That can't be right I'm--
I'm breathing something
Now, Stoney, Iisten to me I want you to foIIow through with the Russian
Don't wait for Dougherty
-Is Dougherty here?
-Dougherty is not there.
The Russian is there
He wants you to open your hatch
Oh, God, I'm tired, CharIes
-I'm tired.
-Stoney, put on your heImet
Open the hatch
Open the hatch
Open
AII right
-BIow hatch
-Negative, do not bIow the hatch
Open it with the Iever, the unIocking Iever
Do you read me, Stoney?
Stoney?
FIight, this is Rescue,
I've got their Iight
Roger, Ted, you've got their acq lights.
BIow hatch
-BIow the hatch
-Do not Do not bIow the hatch!
Hatch bIown
He can't get any cIoser, Buzz
We have to go to him
I've got visual on them now.
I'm gonna brake down to 1 0.
They're about 50 feet apart.
The ApoIIo hatch is open.
-Can you see the crew?
-Negative.
I'm gonna go in a little closer.
There's a light flashing from the Russian ship.
Some guy's floating about 1 50 feet below me. I'm going after him.
Ironman, this is Keith, do you read me?
Come in, Ironman
Ironman, this is Keith, come in.
Ironman One, this is Keith, do you read?
Ironman, this is Keith, do you read me?
Ironman, do you read me?
Keith, this is Rescue.
I'm in the Apollo
The Russian got air to Stoney and I've transferred him to my oxygen
He's aII right, he's breathing
And I've got Lloyd.
Ted, get back to the XRV and prepare for re-entry
Roger, I'm on my way.

THE ANAN ARCHIPELAGO
KOJIMA ISLAND
Annabelle.
Joji.
Charly, what’s wrong?
Don’t send me back to the front!
Charly, pull yourself together!
What is it?
Charly!
I don’t wanna go!
Don’t send me back there!
I won’t go!
I don’t wanna go!
Drugs... gimme drugs.
Give him an injection.
-Captain! Come look at this!
-What/sit?
A swarm of insects!
Starboard engine on fire!
Cut the engine!
What’s our position?
Joji.
Parachutes!
We don’t have details yet, but it seems a B-52 bomber carrying an H-bomb has crash-landed somewhere in the Anan Archipelago.
You will all commence with
Operation Broken Arrow at once.
Lieutenant Colonel Gordon...
I’d like you to assemble a search party to look everywhere until that bomb is found.
Yes, sir.
These skeletons are crumbling.
Captain, take it slow.
Get away from me!
If you hadn’t flipped out, we could’ve avoided that swarm.
Give me some water.
-Me too.
-Get away!
Where are we?
Joji isn’t back yet?
No, he’s still out collecting insects.
You two just got married.
Why does he leave you alone all day?
He’s obsessed with rare insects.
Sure it isn’t an insect with smooth white skin?
What’s that supposed to mean?
Stop it! Let me go!
Damn it!
What’s all this about?
I’m Lieutenant Colonel Gordon,
U.S. Air Force.
Some islanders saw some parachutes falling.
That’s good news.
Where did they land?
On Kojima Island.
I’ll take you there by boat.
Over there!
-He’s alive.
-What could have happened?
He probably fell down that cliff.
-Let’s go inside.
-Come on.
Those are some nasty wounds.
Could they have died while bailing out?
No, somebody did this to them.
-Someone killed them?
-I can’t be sure.
I’ll do an autopsy right away.
Who could do something so brutal?
-Here.
-I don’t want one.
Hey there!
Wanna buy a watch?
You can have it cheap.
Just 10,000 yen.
-That’s a U.S. Air Force watch.
Whered you get it?
Who cares?
Did you get it off one of those pilots who parachuted down?
I don’t need stolen goods!
Suit yourself.
-Yukari!
-Jojil
Where have you been?
I’ve been worried about you.
Going from island to island, gathering insects.
Is that really what you were doing?
What’s gotten into you?
Don’t go getting suspicious.
I told you:
I’m gathering insects for Dr. Nagumo of the Tokyo Biological
Research Center.
I’m tired from hiking all day, so stop getting on my nerves.
I’m sorry.
There are lots of ways.-- a man can get tired out, eh?
-What?
I hear you have a plump white butterfly on one of those islands.
Son of a bitch!
Stop it, Joji!
You’re choking me!
Joji, please stop it!
I’ve got something important to tell you!
What’s going on here?
Nothing at all.
Is there a problem?
That’s him!
I hear you’ve got a U.S. military watch.
Well?
Let me go!
Joji, have you done something wrong?
I haven’t done anything wrong!
I’d like you to come down to the station.
I swear I haven’t done anything!
Are you saying you just found this on Kojima Island?
You’re lying!
You killed the pilot and took it!
You didn’t find it!
-You’re wrong!
-You killed two men to get it!
You’re a goddamn murderer!
I’m not! I swear I’m not!
Dr. Nagumo... a telegram came for you.
What happened to it?
This insect’s poison attacks the central nervous system, causing madness and death.
There are many insects we still don’t know much about.
This is one of them.
A young man named Joji Akiyama sent it to me from Yatsushima.
This is from him.
He’s been arrested for murder!
Dr. Nagumo!
-I got your telegram.
-Please help us.
Joji’s innocent.
I believe him.
There’s no one we can turn to here on the island.
I’ll do all I can to help.
Joji... thank you for the poisonous insects.
They’re a previously undiscovered species.
You mustn’t lose hope!
Hang on for Yukari’s sake.
Or did you really kill those men?
No, I didn’t kill them!
When I was on that island,
I saw the plane explode and the parachutes open.
Then I...
I thought I’d sell the watch and buy something nice for Yukart
You were alone at the time.
Is that right?
Tell the truth.
Or would you rather be tried for murder?
I was with a girl named Annabelle.
Annabelle?
There’s a reason for that,
I presume.
Don’t ask me to tell you more.
-Chief.
-Dr. Nagumo!
Please help me!
Don’t give up, no matter what.
Got that?
I’d like to see the pilots’ bodies.
I’m sending them to the base.
Make it quick.
They’ve been badly bitten by insects.
Cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage from blunt trauma.
But the wounds to the jaw aren’t from being struck.
Hard blows with a sharp rock could have caused those.
I’d like to see the black airman.
Your friend’s guilty.
You’re wasting your time.
-He’s still unconscious?
-Yes... but at times he mumbles deliriously.
“Insects, insects...”
“Insects”?
Insects.--
If he comes to, he may be able to help prove
Joji’s innocence.
I agree.
Who are you?
Dr. Junko Komuro.
The Red Cross sent me.
Pleased to meet you.
I know Joji well.
He wouldn’t kill anyone.
Hey, sweetie.-- how about waiting on us?
Dr. Nagumo!
Joji’s doing fine.
I asked the police chief to let you visit him.
Hey, Doc, welcome!
Thank heavens for that plane crash!
Tourists weren’t coming here, and I thought I’d have to close the bar and hotel.
Hey, flyboy!
Was the plane that crashed a fighter, or was it —
No comment.
And the cause of the crash —
Oh, I bet that’s a “no comment” too!
-It isn’t safe to go out anymore!
-Shut up!
“Shut up”?
Come on now, these guys are Japan’s allies.
We all gotta get along.
-And now for foreign news... locusts have been destroying crops and forests, spreading rapidly across all the states in India
Assam’s food supply has been devastated
-That’s odd.
-Dr. Nagumo... it’s not that unusual.
Don’t India and Africa often have outbreaks of locusts?
But this isn’t locust season.
This is the first I’ve heard of an outbreak out of season.
What a pleasant surprise!
What brings you here today?
What will you have?
-A brandy.
-A brandy?
Coming right up,
Miss Annabelle.
Charly!
Insects! Insects!
Insects are nothing to be afraid of.
Insects!
Insects!
I can’t stand them!
What’s the matter?
A big man like you, afraid of a bug!
But I’m glad you finally woke up, Charly.
Charly?
Who’s Charly?
Colonel, Charly’s regained consciousness.
-I see.
-But he’s lost his memory.
Lost his memory?
He must have hit his head falling down that cliff.
In that case, it’ll be hard to continue with Operation Broken Arrow.
Do all you can to help him get his memory back.
Yes, sir.
Operation Broken Arrow...
-Annabelle?
-Who are you?
I’m Dr. Nagumo.
I’ve come to prove Joji’s innocence.
Joji’s innocence?
Why won’t you testify in his defense?
Testify?
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
He told me he was with you when it happened.
I do know Joji.
I asked him to collect insects for me.
-You too?
For 20-odd years, these islands didn’t belong to Japan, so they reverted to a natural state.
It’s a rare environment.
You could say it’s an insect paradise.
But people will soon return in large numbers and disturb the natural balance.
What will become of the insects then?
We can already see that people will destroy them.
Are you a biologist too?
No, I just love insects, because they never lie.
I don’t trust people.
-Why not?
You’re Japanese.
Can you have forgotten what happened here two decades ago?
Of course not.
No Japanese person can forget that.
One of the Pacific War’s fiercest battles was fought here.
Human beings are about to repeat the mistakes of that time.
Annabelle... the world is indeed filled with chaos and danger, but we’re not about to wage a final war of annihilation.
Are you that naive?
No, I just have faith in people.
Well, I don’t!
I take it the war took its toll on you.
It left deep scars, scars nobody could ever forget.
Scars nobody should ever forget.
One should fan the flames of such hatred.
Here.
I’m going to have a baby.
-We’re going to have a baby.
-Are you sure?
Yes. Dr. Komuro examined me.
She says I’m three months’ pregnant.
What’s the matter?
It’s your child.
Aren’t you happy?
What’s going on?
I’m going to be a father... and be tried for murder.
What’s going to happen to the baby?
Why didn’t you tell me sooner?
You were away on Kojima for so long.
I wanted to tell you the happy news as soon as possible.
Leave them alone.
Insects have babies too.
That’s why I asked you not to capture them.
That’s the only way we can earn a living!
I’m being sent to Tokyo to be tried for murder.
I’m done for!
Joji, don’t lose hope!
Dr. Nagumo will save us.
I’m sure of it.
Charly’s amnesia isn’t improving.
Colonel Gordon, why do you need him to get his memory back?
Is it to prove Joji’s innocence?
I doubt it.
Joji’s no more than an insect to you.
What’s your point?
You want Charly’s memory back to figure out where your H-bomb landed.
Are you a spy for the Eastern bloc?
Can’t you people see things any other way?
You divide everyone into East and West!
Don’t dodge the question!
I’m just trying to prove a young man’s innocence!
I’m sorry. I take that back.
But how did you know about the H-bomb?
I’d heard that
Operation Broken Arrow is U.S. Air Force code for nuclear weapon-related accidents.
Please keep that confidential.
But what if plutonium from the H-bomb irradiates the surrounding area?
H-bombs are equipped with 40 fail-safes.
No radiation will leak out.
Then why are you so anxious to find that bomb?
I don’t have time to argue with you.
In any event, though our goals differ, we both want Charly to recover his memory.
Don’t worry.
There’s nothing to fear.
We’re ready, sir.
Then let’s start.
Hold Charly down.
Please begin.
Stop!
The insects are coming!
They’re gonna kill me!
Where are the insects?
No! No!
Whyd you go in that cave?
Did something terrible happen?
Charly, try to remember.
It’s dark.
I can’t see a thing.
-Where? In the cave?
And then?
What did you do then?
Light...
There was a light in the darkness.
Insects!
So insects killed those men.
It was a hallucination.
He’s a drug addict.
A drug addict?
He started taking drugs to ease his fear of combat and got addicted.
That’s why I think he’s describing hallucinations.
-Poor guy.
-We’re fighting for freedom!
We’re spilling our blood for freedom and independence!
Can you be certain your war is just?
Nagumo!
I’m going to go see that cave for myself.
I’ll show you the way.
Where’s that bomb?
Where did it land?
Answer me!
Where’s the H-bomb?
If we don’t locate it before the world finds out, we’ll look like fools!
Now tell me!
Insects attacked our plane!
They made us crash.
Damn fool!
You’re hallucinating again!
It’s true!
Insects brought us down!
-Colonel, we found the plane.
-And the bomb?
We’re still searching for it.
That’s strange.
There are no insects anywhere.
So it was a hallucination after all?
I don’t think so.
I’m afraid.
The insects are gone.
This is used for raising poisonous insects.
It’s recent.
Someone’s been here.
Dr. Nagumo!
It’s just a scratch.
Somebody’s been up to something in this cave.
If we figure out what it is, we can prove Joji’s innocence.
Joji! Don’t go yet!
Please wait until Dr. Nagumo returns!
Yukari!
I’m resigned to it now.
-What are you saying?
-That’s enough.
Let me have one last look at the sea.
I may never see such a beautiful sight again.
It’s so beautiful.
I’m going to escape.
I’ll be damned if I just let them kill me.
For your sake and the baby’s,
I’m going to make a run for it.
Stop!
-Stop or I’ll shoot!
-No, don’t!
He’s getting away!
Stop!
No, don’t!
-Why all the commotion?
-The bastard got away.
Joji escaped, the cocky bastard.
Annabelle... help me, please!
It’s Charly.
His memory’s returned.
-Where’s he going?
-That’s none of your concern.
It is. He’s a witness in a murder investigation.
We can’t prove Joji’s innocence without his testimony.
We have questions for him too.
Go on.
Now!
Don’t shoot!
Please don’t shoot me!
There’s a bug.
Annabelle... what do you do with the insects I catch for you?
Joji, just do as I say.
You can’t run away from me now.
If you leave, you’ll be arrested and hanged for murder.
No reason to get so startled.
Oh, Dr. Nagumo...
Charly’s got some guts, killing those MPs like that.
Charly?
Charly’s ill.
I don’t think he has that kind of willpower.
He’s a wild beast.
He’ll turn savage if left unchecked.
You’re the beast for thinking that way.
Lay a finger on her again and you’ll be sorry!
I get the picture.
Help us out here.
Don’t just stand there!
Hold him down!
You’re going to answer my questions.
What kind of plane were you in?
Come on... talk!
Out with it!
A bomber.
And what was that bomber carrying?
Son of a bitch!
Stop it!
Who the hell are you?
Why are you asking these things?
-Shut up!
The U.S. Air Force is frantically searching for that plane.
It must have been carrying a pretty important payload.
Now.., tell us what it was!
Hold it.
That won’t make him talk.
Annabelle, what are you going to do?
-Annabelle —
-Back off!
-Annabelle —
-Just shut up and watch!
When these insects bite... within minutes your cranial nerves are paralyzed... and you go crazy and then die!
-Stop! This is too cruel!
-Get back!
No human being would do this!
That’s right, a human being wouldn’t... so I’m letting the insects do it for me!
Are you out of your mind?
Who did this to me?
Who tattooed these numbers on me?
You know what these numbers mean?
They marked me for death at Auschwitz!
My parents and siblings all died in Nazi concentration camps during the war.
They suffered more than any soldier.
They were tortured to death!
Nazi soldiers made me their plaything, then branded me for death!
Now you tell me to trust in people?
I don’t trust human beings anymore.
Help!
-What was that plane carrying?
-An H-bomb.
An H-bomb?
Please, quickly!
-Where is it?
-I don’t know!
Tell me where the bomb is!
Take the bugs out.
I’ve got more questions.
Not so fast!
Get away from him.
You got what you wanted.
Now it’s time for my little experiment.
Hey, let’s go tell the boss.
The old man already went to bed.
-What do you want this late?
-A shot of whiskey.
Whiskey?
You’re a pain in the butt.
I thought I heard a shortwave radio.
I couldn’t sleep.
I was fooling around a bit.
I exchange messages with a foreign lady friend.
It’s my one hobby.
A fitting hobby for you.
Good night.
What is it?
The door’s unlocked.
“Colonel Gordon: There are
Eastern bloc spies on the island.
They’re after the H-bomb.”
Call the base. Tell them to step up our underwater search efforts.
Get out!
He’s gone totally nuts.
Things will get interesting now!
I don’t know if having the baby is such a good idea now.
You mustn’t try to get rid of it.
But I’m afraid it won’t have a happy life.
You mustn’t lose hope.
Yukari... the baby isn’t just yours.
Joji’s happy about the baby, isn’t he?
Yes, but he’s —
-What are you doing?
-Let me go!
Yukari, run!
Don’t you recognize me?
Please.., drop the gun.
Dr. Nagumo!
Charly’s got a gun!
-What?
He’s dead.
Genocide.., genocide... genocide
Genocide.-- the extermination of mankind.
The insects are singing about destroying humanity.
He’s been bitten.
The bites are festering.
What’s this about?
He depended on me.
I feel I let him down.
It’s unbelievable.
I don’t understand any of this.
Insect eggs.
The insects laid their eggs inside his body.
Their eggs? That’s bizarre.
Unbelievable!
Insects don’t lay eggs in human bodies.
The pilots in the cave looked exactly the same.
They might have been filled with eggs as well.
Their bodies were flown home.
We could have a problem here.
We’d better bury the body quickly.
We found poison in Charly’s blood.
A poison we’ve never seen.
Here’s the analysis.
That’s poison from an insect on this island.
I’ve analyzed it in my lab in Tokyo.
That reminds me:
Charly said something odd.
He said a swarm of insects brought down the bomber, but that’s impossible.
Insects can’t fly at 30,000 feet.
Perhaps... but something abnormal is going on in the insect world.
Why did Charly mention genocide?
Genocide...
The extermination of mankind.
Annabelle!
Are you listening?
Our government wants those poisonous insects at once!
Not yet.
You’re not sending a single one until I’m satisfied.
You’re delusional.
Who do you think is paying for your research?
Don’t forget that the Eastern bloc is paying for all this.
We’re taking them.
I don’t care whether I live in a free society... or a communist one.
What?
I just want to breed vast numbers of insects that drive people mad... and scatter them all over the world.
You’re crazy!
Who’s the crazy one?
Your plans for germ warfare are just as crazy.
Go and see.
Joji!
If he tells Colonel Gordon, our work is ruined. Catch him!
It’s me!
It’s me — Jojil
I’m so glad you’re safe.
I’m sorry I made you worry.
-Are you hurt?
-No.
Those two men from the fishing boat came looking for you.
What’s wrong?
Joji, where have you been hiding all this time?
At Annabelle’s house.
I was afraid of that.
No! No!
We’re going to have a baby, and yet you —
You knew about her?
I was wrong.
Please forgive me.
But I don’t love Annabelle.
I hate her!
-You’re lying.
-I’m not!
She’s not even human.
She’s insane.
She keeps poisonous insects and injects their poison into other insects to breed poisonous new species.
She’s the one who made Charly go mad.
If we don’t stop her, she’s going to kill everyone on the islands.
I have to let Dr. Nagumo know, but they’re watching, so I can’t get near him.
They’re here.
Open up!
Open the door!
-Where’s Joji?
-I don’t know.
-Where’d he go?
You bitch!
If you don’t tell us —
-Tell us!
-Check over there.
My baby will die!
Lying bitch...
Where did Joji go!
Tell me, you bitch!
Quick!
Come here, you!
Go tell the old man.
I’ll take his wife hostage.
Shit! She got away!
Where’s Joji now?
He uses huts around the island when collecting insects.
He’s probably in one of those.
He may get hurt in his haste to get away.
We’ll get Dr. Komuro and set out at dawn.
I need to wrap it.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Annabelle used Charly as her guinea pig.
He was writhing in agony... screaming and on the verge of death.
So she used him as her guinea pig.
He spoke of exterminating mankind.
It was a strange thing to say.
Insect behavior has been abnormal all over the world.
The damage they’re causing is spreading.
Planes everywhere are flying into swarms and crashing.
Genocide... the annihilation of mankind, the screaming of the insects.
I can’t believe it’s all coincidence.
But Charly was a drug addict.
We can’t imagine the hallucinations he might have seen.
Was it all his imagination, or was there something else to it?
I want to find out.
But how?
I’m going to let those insects bite me.
I’ll hallucinate just like Charly did.
Dr. Nagumo!
But you’ll go mad and die like Charly did!
Dr. Nagumo, you mustn’t!
No, I have to try.
If this is injected within ten minutes, it should neutralize the toxin.
Are you sure?
It works on guinea pigs, but I don’t know about human beings.
We don’t have much time.
Joji, get that chair.
Tie my legs tight.
Make sure they won’t come loose.
What time is it?
6:50 p.m.
Joji, put one on my chest.
Quick!
Hurry up!
Give me the antidote at 7:00.
Go on.
I feel dizzy...
I feel like throwing up...
Not yet!
In exactly 10 minutes.
Between my bones.., the insects...
They’re wiggling between my bones.
They’re coursing through me...
The light... it’s coming...
They’re running...
Insects...
The insects are singing.
They’re talking.
“The Earth doesn’t belong to human beings alone.
We don’t care if mankind destroys itself with nuclear weapons, but we refuse to let you take us with you.
Destroy the human race!
Genocide.
Exterminate all humans!”
Dr. Nagumo!
Dr. Nagumo.
It’s hard to believe.
I heard insects’ voices.
Yet we have to believe it.
They’re sensitive creatures.
They fear nuclear destruction more than we do, so they’ve turned against us.
Downing that bomber was their first attack on mankind.
So the three crewmen, including Charly, were the insects’ first victims.
Another one may be dying somewhere.
Weren’t there just three parachutes?
No, I’m pretty sure I saw... four parachutes.
Four?
Wait a minute.
One of them came down really fast, and it glistened in the sun!
Now I get it.
That’s what Colonel Gordon and his men are after.
The H-bomb.
One of those parachutes was the H-bomb.
We should tell
Colonel Gordon right away.
No, we have to stop the insects first.
I’ll take you there.
Doctor, call my lab in Tokyo right away.
Have them make large quantities of antidote.
All right.
Take me with you.
I’m tired of being alone.
Son of a bitch!
Hold it!
Hold it right there.
You’re coming with us.
You’re going to take us to the H-bomb.
-I don’t know where it is.
-Don’t give me that!
Go on!
Wait!
Dr. Nagumo.
I’m right here.
Care for a drink?
No, thanks.
Go ahead.
It’ll be your last drink on Earth.
What?
I hear you did an experiment on yourself.
I want you to do it again, but without the antidote.
Anabelle!
Genocide.
The extermination of man.
That’s what I’ve been waiting for!
-Why?
The human heart holds nothing but hatred.
Our history is a cycle of hate and war.
We know nothing of love.
We only know hatred!
Annabelle!
You don’t know what hell those camps were or how I feel.
Pull out the bed!
-Listen to me!
Don’t move.
I keep my poisonous insects in the basement.
You’ll be my fourth living subject.
Fourth?
It was you who killed those airmen?
That’s right.
I was hatching eggs in that cave.
The two of them showed up, so I used them as guinea pigs.
But that experiment was a failure.
The poison acted too quickly, so their suffering was brief.
I’m also the one who shot at you in the cave.
You’re as toxic as your insects!
Hurry up and move the bed.
Open the trapdoor.
Hurry it up!
What is it?
There it is!
The H-bomb!
They’re getting away!
Stop where you are!
Stop or we’ll shoot!
Too late!
The insects are gone.
Still don’t believe it?
I don’t care about insects.
I just don’t want those spies to find the bomb.
This is all happening because both sides persist in your senseless arms race.
Don’t you understand?
-Shut up!
Burn this house down!
Everyone out now!
I’m afraid.
The insects are killing the monkeys.
Oh, no!
Don’t look.
What’s going to happen to us?
We haven’t done anything wrong, but we’ll be killed anyway.
Maybe I deserve to die, but you —
-Don’t talk like that.
-Yukari...
I’ve caused you nothing but worry.
I’ve done nothing for you.
Please forgive me.
If I were reborn into this world,
I’d marry you all over again.
I know you’re a spy, you bastard!
You’re a disgrace to Japan!
Where are Joji and Yukari?
Tell me!
Okay, I’ll tell you. Please stop.
They’re one island over, near where the H-bomb came down.
Is that the truth?
Yes, Matsunaga contacted me by radio.
Matsunaga, Yokol, come In.
Answer me!
Matsunaga, Yokol, come ini
/f you can hear me, respond!
Insects.
Over there too.
And there too!
Are you all right?
We have to do something!
Don’t try to stop me!
Matsunaga, Yokoi, answer me!
Answer me!
Joji, Yukari!
Answer if you can hear me.
Dr. Nagumo, have you located them?
There’s no answer.
Did you contact Tokyo?
Yes, but nobody would believe me.
Humanity’s facing extinction, and now this!
We’ll leave for the island at dawn.
Joji, Yukari! Answer me!
Get inside here.
What about you?
I have to protect you.
I’ll fight them off to the end.
You have to survive no matter what!
Joji, I want to die with you!
What are you saying?
You’re carrying our baby!
You wanna kill the baby too?
Have our baby, all right?
Get in!
Once it’s safe, get off the island as fast as you can.
Hurry!
Watch out!
Stay down there!
Yukari, you must survive!
Live on without me!
This is the aftermath.
There’s a hut over there.
How did this happen?
How?
Yukari!
Yukari, hang on!
You survived.
Where’s Joji?
Don’t look.
It’s better not to look.
Don’t look.
Dr. Nagumol
Come with me.
What is it, Colonel Gordon?
Look at that.
-Is that a tornado?
-No, insects.
Insects?
You still don’t believe me?
It’s the revenge of the insects.
I understand now.
Nagumo, we need you.
Come with us to the base.
-I don’t have time.
I have to evacuate the islanders and destroy the insects.
Stop!
You’re coming with us!
What are you doing?
Nagumo, we need you.
Get in the jeep.
-Dr. Nagumo.
-I’ll be back.
-Evacuate the island right away.
-WhatlI happen to us?
Can we destroy the insects?
I don’t know, but we have to try.
Hurry up!
I promise I’ll be back.
Yukari.
Yukari, where are you going?
To have my baby somewhere without any insects!
To have Joji’s baby!
It’s too dangerous!
In your condition you’ll die out at sea!
Nagumo.-- have a seat.
-I don’t want to kill you.
-What do you mean?
You’re an expert on insects, aren’t you?
You want the antidote.
You catch on quick.
That’s right.
You aren’t the only ones who need it.
The islanders do too!
Not anymore.
Why not?
They’ll be dead in a few minutes.
The H-bomb’s about to detonate.
When we send a signal on the detonator’s frequency, it’ll explode.
It’s our last resort to keep it out of enemy hands.
That’s crazy!
Thatli kill everyone on the islands!
It’ll rain radiation on the rest of Japan.
What will the Japanese do?
Certain sacrifices must be made in war.
Detonating it will wipe out the insects before they can spread and keep the bomb out of enemy hands.
It’ll also protect our military secrets.
It’s a small sacrifice to save the whole world!
Superpower arrogance is what it is!
All ready, sir.
-No, don’t!
-Don’t interfere!
Try that again and I’ll shoot.
-Don’t do it!
-Back off!
Hold it!
What the hell are you doing?
I refuse to be responsible for destroying the world.
I’m not going to trigger a nuclear war!
Colonel, watch out!
Insects!
We’ve flown into a swarm!
THE END
Today's top of the news comes from the top of the world.
The unpredictable Admiral Harriman Nelson has done it again.
His brainchild, a fantastic atomic submarine... with an amazing glass nose... is now undergoing final tests below the ice at the North Pole.
To sit in judgment on the final test... the Bureau of Marine Exploration has sent a seaplane... with its top officer, the former vice admiral B.J. Crawford...
to rendezvous with the submarine Seaview in the Arctic.
Flying with him is the congressional watchdog of the budget... penny-pinching congressman
Lewellyn Parker... who had fought a losing fight against what he had termed...
"Nelson's Folly. "
And so the question of the day comes to this-
Will the final test on the U.S.O.S. Seaview... turn it into "Nelson's Folly"... or will it be another triumph of a great man... a great inventor who, despite his oddball reputation... may yet emerge as the predominant scientific genius of our time?
So bon voyage, Admiral Nelson.
Good luck, Seaview.
Well, gentlemen, modesty forbids my adding anything to that.
- Shall we take her down, Captain?
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Let's make it 90 feet at the start.
- Aye, sir.
Diving stations.
Diving stations.
- Any time you're ready, Mr. Thompson.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Stand by.
Clear the decks, Mr. Thompson.
- Decks clear.
- Decks clear.
Prepare to dive.
Close all main ballast tank vents.
Stand by to blow tanks.
Ballast tanks full.
- Close the vent.
- Flood negative.
Full dive on the planes.
Fifteen degrees down bubble.
Secure the air.
- All agreed?
- All agreed.
Dive! All dive!
- Pressure in the boat.
- Up scope.
9-0 feet.
Level off at 9-0 feet.
Down scope.
All ahead two-thirds.
All ahead two-thirds.
- Final trim, Captain.
- Carry on.
Well, final trim, sir.
Depth: 9-0 feet. Speed: two-thirds.
Well, Lee, it's been a long, tough haul... from conception to execution... but, my boy, we've done it.
You've done it, sir. It bears out what you taught us at Annapolis.
"The wild dreams of today... are the practical realities of tomorrow. "
- I'm glad you remembered one of my more temperate quotes.
Some of our colleagues haven't been quite so diplomatic.
Say, speaking of diplomacy, we've got some guests to entertain.
I've met 'em.
Now it's your turn.
And just remember, they hold the purse strings to this "folly" of ours.
- Shall we dress?
- Dress?
Black tie.
Let's go.
- Take the conn, Ed. I'll be fore.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Beautiful, isn't it?
It's the most exotic thing I've ever seen.
No more, thank you.
Admiral.
Nice to see you, sir.
- Captain Crane, Dr. Hiller.
- How do you do?
- Congressman Parker.
- How do you do, sir?
You have an expensive toy here, Admiral.
Though it is suitable for sightseeing.
QUite right, sir. We hope to see sights never before seen by man... and by seeing, solve some of the mysteries of the deep.
Sorry for the brief hello when you came aboard...
- but this, uh, toy of mine is a demanding lady.
- Aren't we all.
Washington probably thought you needed a woman's touch around here.
- Research project, isn't it?
- That's right.
The reaction of crewmen under conditions of lengthy confinement?
Yes, Admiral, and I appreciate the honor of being the only woman aboard.
- Ah, but you're not. We have another one.
- Oh?
You'll meet her.
Shall we see the rest of the ship?
Well, I did think that was the purpose of our visit.
- Doctor.
- Congressman.
The control room- the brain of the sub.
Over here, we have our chauffeurs.
It takes two to run this toy- helmsman and planesman.
Now, on a submarine, it's always Christmas.
That's what I've been telling Congress.
Wrong deduction, sir.
That's our Christmas tree.
Tells us when we can dive.
Now, if we go down before all those lights are green... we start bailing.
Over here... we have our ballast control.
- How does it work?
- Like an elevator system, Doctor.
Takes us up and lets us down.
Now, on this side... that is radar.
This is sonar. Sonar keeps us from running into anything under the water.
Radar does the same thing on the surface.
Oh. Try this one, Congressman.
Two "S"s in "progress. "
Uh, now if you'll come down here, Doctor.
This is our missile tracking tape.
If we have to shoot, at least we like to know where the missile's going.
And if we do shoot, over there are the buttons.
The trick is to know which one.
Suppose the other fella shoots first?
In that event, sir, that's the way out.
This way, Doctor, please.
And watch your step here.
The radio shack. Lee?
- Excuse me. This way, please.
- Sparks?
- Make that Washington call in exactly 11 minutes.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Not even Jules Verne dreamed of anything like this.
- The world's only undersea aquarium.
- What on earth is he doing?
- Shark walking.
- Shark walking?
Come on, Bessie. Come on.
You want to get well, don't you?
For ages, man has been trying to learn the secret of the fish.
Now we have a perfect underwater laboratory.
Well, Lucius, back with your fish again, I see.
B.J. It's nice to see you.
Commodore Emery, this is
Dr. Hiller and Congressman Parker.
How do you do, Commodore?
I still don't understand what he's doing.
The commodore regards all sea creatures as personal friends.
He'd rather be remembered for his discovery of a new fish... than as one of the leading physicists of our time.
- May I explain?
- I wish you would.
My little friend Bessie here, we had to drug her in order to do some tests.
Now I'm trying to force some water through her gills so she doesn't drown.
In her present condition, she wouldn't even bite a congressman.
Well, then she's the only one on board who wouldn't.
- Oh, you're much too sensitive, Congressman.
- Right you are, Doctor.
- Come along, everybody.
- See you later, Lucius, I hope.
Come on!
Hup, two, three.
Come on. Get going.
Watch your step there.
You've seen the brain of the sub.
In here is the heart-
the atomic motor room.
- Careful, sir. That's our warning system.
- Disregard.
No one is allowed in there, not even congressmen.
You understand.
For your own safety.
Now, down here you'll find the sting of the ship.
In fact, there are more stings in here than in a hornet's nest.
The missile and escape room.
Congressman, there is more destructive force in this room... than in all the explosives used in World War II.
The missiles are for research.
Experimental torpedoes. You name 'em, we've got 'em. Show 'em, Lee.
Right. Well, let's see.
Here's something new.
This is a magnetic primer. In case we lose power in the control room... we just slap this dude on by hand, and away she goes.
This looks like a pineapple.
Some pineapple.
One bite, and pow.
- Well, don't worry. It can't activate itself.
- Captain?
- Yes, sir?
- Where does this door lead to?
That leads to DavyJones's locker, sir.
I would suggest if you contemplate using it, you use this.
- No, no, thank you.
- No offense, sir. Red.
- Yes, sir.
- Well, shall we continue?
B.J.?
Take a look at this lad.
He's Seaman Smith.
- Recognize him?
- Should I?
Seems only yesterday you were bouncing him on your knees.
- Smith- Ol' Bricktop's boy!
- Yeah.
- Spittin' image of him too.
- Isn't he?
His mother wrote me that he finished his hitch in the navy... so I had him sign up with us on the double.
- He looks a little big for me to bounce on my knee now.
- Yeah.
- Jimmy, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
And now you're a minisub man.
How do you like the new model?
She handles like a dream, sir.
I can't wait to test her under the ice.
- You will. Good luck, my boy.
- Thank you, sir.
Sorry to break in on your social life.
Back to work.
This should interest you, Doctor.
Dr. Jamieson, Dr. Hiller,
Congressman Parker.
- How do you do?
- Happy to meet you, Congressman.
- Thank you.
- The Dr. Hiller?
It's a pleasure to welcome such a distinguished psychiatrist aboard.
You flatter me. You seem very well equipped here and pleasantly unoccupied.
Well, we're hoping to keep it that way with the help of these little gadgets.
Afraid it's mandatory that you wear our newest style in submarine sportswear.
- May I?
- Thank you.
If you pick up a fatal dose of radiation, it glows red.
- A fatal dose of radiation?
- Oh, there's a warning. It loses all its color first.
By the way, give me one of those for Admiral Crawford.
I hate to break this up, Doc, but I have some healthier places to show our guests.
I'll check in later with you, Doctor.
See ya.
Uh, this way, please.
Ah, there you are.
I've just introduced our guests to Dr. Jamieson.
- By the way, Admiral, I have your dosimeter here.
- Good man,Jamieson.
He'll keep you well filled in on statistics.
Attention!
Well, Admiral, I-I suppose she's your dancing dietitian? And he's your musical chef?
- She is my secretary. And as for him-
- Sorry.
- I'm to blame, sir. I started it all.
- I have no doubt of that.
Doctor, I told you another woman was aboard, but I hardly expected you to meet her... under such boisterous circumstances.
It all seems very gay and happy, and I am here to observe.
Yes, not choreography to a trumpet!
Mr. Romano, belay that noisy horn.
As for you, Miss Connors, we shall have a little talk later.
- Doctor.
- I'll have a little talk now, Lieutenant, outside.
Romano, aren't you about due back on duty?
Not for another two minutes yet, sir.
- Now, Lieutenant-
- Yes?
- Yes, sir.
- Sir!
I'm sure your act will get a wonderful review in the Congressional Record.
- Will they break me, Captain?
- Well, they've broken better men for less.
How do you explain this undignified behavior?
I was just showing them how I'll dance at my wedding.
I see. Well, that is an extenuating circumstance.
- In about three weeks, isn't it?
- And two days and four hours.
Mm-hmm.
Who's the unlucky man?
Pardon me, Captain.
May I?
By all means, Lieutenant.
What did you say about undignified behavior, Captain?
Captain Crane. Control Room, please.
We'll continue this discussion later...
Lieutenant.
Calling Seaview. Calling Seaview.
- Come in, Washington.
- Hello, Seaview.
- We're making contact, sir.
- Very well.
- You called me, sir?
- Yes.
We're just about through to Washington.
Stand by to take her deep.
- Come in.
- All set, sir. Inspector Bergen's on the line.
- Bergen, Nelson here.
- Forget the amenities. How's she running?
Like a clock. We're all set to make our dive under the ice.
Official checkout time: 3-4-2.
- Make it 500 feet.
- Aye, aye, sir.
We'll be out of sound range in a few seconds, Bergen... and then ride radio silence for the next 96 hours.
- Give him my regards.
- B.J. sends his best to you landlubbers.
Is he seasick yet?
He was the worst sailor in the navy.
- Well, good hunting.
- Thank you, Inspector.
Keep a lamp burning.
- Hi, Susan.
- Oh, hi, Cathy.
Personnel file you asked for.
Oh, thanks.
Have some hot coffee?
Best prescription you've written today, Doctor.
Say, this Captain Crane of yours is surprisingly young for a job this size.
He was the youngest sub captain in the navy.
He must have a friend at court.
The admiral?
It's a bad diagnosis, Doctor.
They are almost like father and son, but the captain earned his rank.
- Neither he nor the admiral would have it any other way.
- Oh.
No criticism intended. I'm sure you'll both live happily ever after.
You know, settling down isn't going to be an easy adjustment after all this.
Well, I was born on a farm, and I'm going back.
We bought a small ranch in Colorado.
We bought a small ranch in Colorado.
- What do you read?
- Can't make it out, Captain.
- Iceberg, sir?
- I don't know.
- Nose camera.
- Camera on.
Take over.
I'll be fore.
Here they are.
- Admiral-
- How deep are we?
- Riding at 500 feet. 650 left from keel to bottom.
- Take her to a thousand.
Take her to a thousand feet.
Emergency!
- Sonar?
- Clear overhead, sir.
- Surface!
- Surface! Surface!
Congressman, you and the ladies go aft.
It might be safer there.
Break out the polar gear.
Let's go, B.J.
- Just breaking surface, sir.
- All stop.
- All stop.
- Crack the hatch.
- Crack the hatch!
- Let's go. Come on, B.J.
My God!
The sky's on fire!
What happened?
Come on.
Let's find out.
Get Washington.
- Hurry up. Make it quick. Get Washington.
- Aye, aye, sir.
There's a bad magnetic storm, sir.
- Can you clear it?
- I'm trying, sir.
U.S.O.S. Seaview calling Washington.
Come in, Washington.
- I can't seem to break through, sir.
- Keep trying.
Admiral Nelson calling Bureau of Marine
Exploration. Inspector Bergen.
Rescue team, up and out on the double!
Man on the ice. Belay the parkas.
Rescue team, topside, on the double!
All set, sir.
Inspector Bergen's on the line.
- Pipe this through the ship.
- Aye, aye.
Bergen, we've just seen it.
What is it?
Nelson, we've been calling you for almost three days.
- What's that fire in the sky?
- It's the Van Allen Belt of radiation- the 300-mile level.
It caught fire about 50 hours ago.
Nobody knows how, but a South African observatory... reported heavy meteor activity at about the same time it exploded.
- Theoretically, it's possible.
- What's the forecast?
We just don't know. The U.N. has called an emergency scientific conference.
It's working around the clock.
The world's top brains are there-
Pittar, Zucco, Charbier- and the president wants you there on the double.
- Can you send a plane for me?
- Impossible.
Thermal conditions have grounded all aircraft.
There's nothing flying anywhere in the world.
The temperature has reached
135 degrees... and there's no way of knowing how much hotter it will get.
DEW line headquarters just below the pole reports the polar ice caps are melting.
Okay, Bergen, we're on our way.
Be there in two days.
Godspeed. Out.
- Let's get going, Captain.
- In a moment, sir.
Picked up a survivor. He's in pretty bad shape.
Doc, lend a hand.
Must've been out there for two days.
He's burned to a crisp.
- Who is he?
- I don't know.
Let's get him to sick bay.
- Take her down. Full speed. New York.
- New York?
Aye, aye, sir.
- He had this pooch with him.
- Take care of him.
- Here are the man's papers.
- Take her down, periscope depth.
Dive!
Full dive on the planes.
Flood negative.
- All ahead full.
- All ahead full.
- What's his name?
- Miguel Alvarez.
A civilian scientist. Doing a government survey on Ice Floe Delta.
- He's lucky to be alive.
- So are we.
Yeah.
- How is he, Doctor?
- Severe exposure.
Small wonder lying out there in 135-degrees heat for two days.
- Listen, Doctor.
- Jim, you there?
I- I can't hold on.
It's breaking away.
The ice floe's drifting.
Jim. Jim.
Can you hear me?
Mac, you there? Mac? Mac?
There must be others still out there on that ice.
This is the captain. Reverse course.
Repeat: reverse course.
Rescue team, stand by.
This is Admiral Nelson.
Hold your course.
You heard what the man said. We can't leave this area without searching for survivors.
Captain Crane, if we waste any time at all here... there may be no survivors left anywhere in the world.
Help me.! Please.!
Help me! Mac! Mac!
I've got it, Lieutenant.
Sir?
I didn't know there was a regulation about not picking up survivors.
Lee? Lee?
The chances are no one's still alive out there anyway.
He was still alive, wasn't he?
The blazing
Van Allen Belt continues to spread a path... of death and destruction across the world.
The rising heat has touched off raging forest fires... in the Ural Mountains of Russia... the Black Forest of Germany, and the rich French timberlands.
These film clips from the northwest-
Let's see how the rest of the crew's taking it.
The situation grows more desperate with a report that emergency shipping-
- Are they still at it, Cookie?
- For more than 24 hours, sir.
And they've eaten nothing but coffee and pencils in all that time.
- Excuse me.
- I better see if he needs me.
The projection must be on the nose.
No margin for error.
Now, if these figures prove out-
Keeping you awake, Harry?
Yeah.
Now, the last temperature reading-
It checks. It checks! On the nose!
Lucius, I think we've hit it.
Oh, you're always so sure of everything.
- If the temperature maintains the same rate of progression- - If.
- Yes, if. And if we can reach there by the 29th-
- 29th?
- It has to be the 29th.
- and project at exactly 16 hours-
- B.J., it's right. I don't see how we can miss!
- Do you need me, sir?
Huh? Oh, uh, no, Connors.
Thank you.
- And close the door on the way out, will you?
- Yes, sir.
Lucius?
- Now what?
- Get off that couch.
Let's double-check these figures.
I do more walking for you than I do with the shark.
Yeah. Now, at the present rate of temperature rise-
The fiery sky is now threatening to strike a mortal blow... at the heart of the Midwest farm belt.
Thousands of acres of vital grain... have already shriveled under the intense heat... giving rise to fears of famine... if the flaming belt continues to rage unchecked.
In Italy, all roads leading to Rome and the Vatican... have been jammed for two days.
From all over Europe, the faithful have been streaming towards St. Peter's... to pray for deliverance from the catastrophe which has struck the Earth.
Here now, our television satellite camera in outer space... showing the frightening ring of fire encircling the Earth.
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our broadcast for today.
Well, there will be a hot time in the old world tonight.
That's not even funny, Mac.
- Attention!
- As you were.
Well, you've all seen it.
There's not much that I can add... except to tell you that the situation is far from hopeless.
Right now in New York, the greatest scientific minds in the world... are working around the clock analyzing ways and means of survival.
And don't forget, we have two of the best scientific minds right here on this boat.
Sir? Sir, what about leave?
I live in New York, and I got a baby that's new in the family.
I'm sorry. There hasn't been any word on leaves yet.
But I'll keep you all posted.
We've just received word that
Admiral Nelson is in the building... and he's walking through the lower hallway.
Excitement has been at fever pitch since last night's radio report...
from the submarine Seaview... that the admiral had conceived a plan... which hopefully might extinguish the flaming Van Allen Belt.
Now, several theories are already under consideration by the U.N.
In fact, yesterday, Dr. Zucco, the eminent physicist of Vienna... presented his own plan... which in essence says,
"Hands off. Let's wait and see. "
Unofficial sources tell us that Dr. Zucco's arguments... swayed the scientific body, and they might give him their stamp of approval.
However, in view of Admiral Nelson's tremendous scientific achievements... we've been advised that the international scientific committee... is standing pat until
Nelson's plan can be evaluated.
Pardon the interruption. Some woman is a bit hysterical. Nerves are on edge.
And this may be one of the most important moments in history.
The admiral and Commodore Emery are coming into the conference room right now.
We thank the French delegate for his remarks... and we will take them under advisement.
We acknowledge the arrival... of two of the world's most distinguished scientists...
Admiral Nelson and Commodore Emery.
And now, the chair will listen to Admiral Nelson.
Mr. Chairman... distinguished scientists, ladies and gentlemen.
This planet is impaled on a roasting spit... slowly but inexorably being seared and blistered... by the fire in the sky.
If the Van Allen Belt continues to burn, the world will burn with it.
And no one can doubt that civilization as we know it will disintegrate... if the temperature should rise to 175 degrees.
Now, in the last five days, the recorded temperature rise... has been two degrees every 24 hours.
If that rate is maintained... our planet has a life expectancy of about three weeks.
Therefore-
Therefore, if we are to avoid cremation... we must act at once.
Lucius, let me have those charts of ours and the maps, will you, please?
Thank you. Now, if I may make a comparison.
When a diseased appendage threatens the life of a human body... a doctor has no choice but to amputate.
We have no choice either.
We must amputate the belt, or die.
Amputate? How?
Not with a knife, Doctor, but with a shot in the heart.
The burning belt must be exploded clear of the Earth's magnetic field.
And we have exactly 16 days and... three hours in which to do it.
How do you arrive at that particular timing?
How? The admiral and I have worked out the mathematical formula... and, believe me, our figures are correct.
Oh, he irritates me.
The shot must take place on August the 29th at exactly 4:00 p. m.
The location of this operation is as vital as the time.
A place, uh...
205 miles north-northwest of Guam in the Marianas Islands.
To be exact-
Where are those figures, Lucius? Ah.
To be exact, latitude, 15 degrees north... longitude, 145 degrees east.
The location and the time are dictated by the Earth's rotation... and the consequent trajectory of firing.
Firing of what, Admiral?
An atomic missile, Doctor, fired from the submarine Seaview.
The missile will arc along the burning belt.
As it detonates, it will seed the flames with an overdose of radiation...
'causing the belt to explode outward into space.
Uh, to simplify it, take a toy balloon.
A little too much air, and poof.
No balloon.
A little too much radiation, and-
Poof!. No world!
Insanity! Insanity!
This lunatic scheme will destroy us all.
You gentlemen care to look at our figures?
Give me those.
The admiral's scheme is suicidal insanity.
You should know that, Commodore.
Explode the belt, and you explode the world!
Not if the blast is directed away from us.
No, no, no!
I am diametrically opposed.
I know the chemical composition of the gases within the belt... at the rate of consumption by fire.
My calculations cannot be wrong.!
I say the belt will burn itself out.
At 173 degrees, it will burn itself out.!
Fine. What if it doesn't burn itself out?
You have your plan. I have mine.
Time will judge which one is right.
Doctor, our plan can't wait.
You say the belt will burn out at 173 degrees.
At the present rate of climb, that's August the 30th.
We say it won't burn out, but we can't wait to test our theory... because we must fire the missile on August the 29th.
Otherwise, we lose our angle of trajectory.
Then this scientific body must decide which one of us is right.
I'm not gonna wait and watch the world burn to a crisp.
I have 16 days to get to the Marianas... and I shall need every ounce of speed and every precious moment of time.
Lucius, have the captain stand by to get under way.
- I say the admiral's scheme be referred to committee.!
- There's no time.
- Then I call a vote.
All those in favor of the admiral's scheme?
All those against?
- There's your answer.
- Not mine-yours.
My answer shall come only from the president of the United States.
- Look out!
- We'll never get out of the building.
- We go out the basement.
- Sir, what about the congressman and admiral?
There's no other way.
We'll have to leave them behind.
Whew. This heat.
Hold these, Lieutenant.
Get out of this.
Aboard ship.!
Cast off!.
Clear the decks!
- You all right?
- I'll tell you in just a minute as soon as I get my breath.
- Crash dive.
- What?
- You heard me. Crash dive.
- The U.N. police are on deck. A crash dive will kill 'em.
Give 'em a 15-second warning to clear off, and then dive. That's an order.
Come on, Lucius.
Attention. This is the captain.
This sub will dive in 15 seconds.
Clear the deck.
Sound the klaxon.
- Camera.
- Sail camera on.
Close all main ballast tank vents.
Repeat warning. This sub is diving immediately. Clear the deck.
Clear the deck.
- All right, take her down.
- Prepare to dive!
- Ballast tanks full.
- All green. Dive! Dive!
Bow's under.
Deck's awash.
Stern gone.
- Take the conn, Lieutenant. I'll be in the admiral's cabin.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Lee! He had no other choice.
I hope Washington agrees with you.
I don't understand ordering a crash dive with men on deck.
Zucco just can't be right.
You'd better make deadly sure he's wrong.
- Come in.
- Sir.
Oh, forget it, Lee. Military police swim like fish. It's part of their training.
Now here's our goal- the Marianas.
And we've only got 16 days to get there.
What do you think, Captain?
If the Panama Canal is knocked out... to go around the Horn doubles our distance.
In my opinion,
I'm afraid it's impossible.
Impossible? Sounds like Zucco.
Nothing is impossible.
We'll make it if we get the president's permission.
Captain, set your course for the Marianas as though we already had that permission.
- And give us all the speed you can make.
- Sir-
Captain!
Very well, sir.
Doctor. Mr. Alvarez.
I'd forgotten you two were still aboard.
My orders did not include a trip to the Marianas or wherever you're headed.
Admiral, I must get off this submarine.
There may be no chance to get into port, Doctor.
I'm afraid you'll both have to go along for the ride.
Yes?
Sparks, sir.
No contact yet.
Since the heat went over 139, radio contact is highly erratic.
The radiation has set up a field of static.
Forget the technicalities. Keep at it.
I must talk with the president.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Now, look here, Admiral-
Doctor, as I remember, your research project was "men under stress. "
You couldn't have picked a better laboratory.
Glad to see you up and about, Mr. Alvarez.
Sorry you didn't get ashore... but I'm sure we'll be able to find something to keep you busy.
Don't worry about me, Admiral.
Man must accept what is ordained.
That's a convenient rationalization, but under the circumstances... there seems to be no alternative.
- Check the heat.
- Up scope.
- How hot is it up there?
- 141.2 degrees.
No snow today.
Down scope.
U.S.O.S. Seaview calling Washington.
Come in, Washington.
Twenty-five hours of static in my ear.
Man, I'm gettin' shell shock.
And I'll say it again, loudmouth.
You talk pretty big... behind the admiral's back.
Yeah? Well, here's a message for you, special delivery.
Break it up! Hold it!
Hold it! Knock it off!.
All right, Smithy!
All right, break it up!
Attention!
Now, I don't know who or what started this... but I'm telling you, the next fight ends up in the brig.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
Now you two men shake hands and forget it.
Carry on.
- QUestion, Captain.
- Shoot.
Are we headin' for the Pacific?
I'd answer that question, Gleason, if I could, but I can't yet.
Well, we certainly are headin' someplace mighty fast.
Sir, maybe-maybe home soon.
I can tell you this. We've been heading south for the last 25 hours.
Whether or not we stay on course depends on the president.
The admiral's still trying to contact him.
As for home... you'll be holding that new baby on your knee before you know it.
But what about this burning belt, Captain?
Captain Crane, I just picked up Miami.
- That's my hometown.
- What about that, huh?
- Sparks, this is the captain. Pipe it through the ship.
- Aye, aye, sir.
And the news from Paris is just as disastrous.
The rising water of the Seine has overrun its banks... flooding out thousands of homes in the low-lying areas.
From Moscow, scattered reports indicate a severe shortage of water... as wells from the Ukraine to the Steppes all dry up.
In China and India conditions are chaotic... as riots and pestilence sweep the land.
Meanwhile, the heat has burned like a giant torch across the face of Africa.
Terror-stricken herds of wild animals fleeing from the blazing forests... to the open plains are dying of thirst around mud-caked water holes.
Other reports indicate that steaming water... from the melting
North and South Poles... are being sucked into the air currents... spreading weird, freakish fog banks throughout the world.
In many areas, dense fog severely hampers vital operations.
In this country, the blistering heat continues to blaze... a path of destruction across the Midwest grain belt.
The rich farmland of America is now almost a waste-
Excuse me.
- What's the matter?
- What's the story, Captain?
- Sparks, did we lose contact?
- No, sir.
The admiral ordered a news blackout.
All right, knock it off!.
- Yes?
- Sir, may I ask why you blacked out the news?
A matter of morale, Captain.
No news is better than bad news.
I can't agree, sir. This is no time to cut the men off from the world.
There may be no world at all if we don't start making news instead of listening to it.
- May I be excused, sir?
- Go.
What was that about the fog bank?
Do you remember?
Lee!
All right, Lee.
Simmer down.
Now, I know the admiral was rough, and I also know about maritime regulations.
- It had nothing to do with regulations.
- Lee!
It's a matter of common decency! The men are worried sick about their families.
They have a right to know the facts, good or bad.
- Lee, come have a cup of coffee, talk it over.
- I don't want any coffee.
Please! Now, you know the admiral as well as I do... and we've never known him to be wrong on a question of policy.
- Even if it ruins morale?
- That's just what he hopes to avoid!
He has a strange way of showing it.
There may be some here whose friends and loved ones... have already gone to meet their maker.
If it is God's will that they and we shall die, so be it.
Ajoyous reunion can be only a brief moment away.
That's enough, Mr. Alvarez.
That's more than enough.
What kind of talk is this anyway?
- I only came to offer comfort.
- Comfort? You offer defeatism!
May I remind you this is a federal ship, and these are federal seamen.
By what right do you dare preach of imminent death... of meek resignation to the inevitable?
- Captain, I-
- Nothing is inevitable except defeat... for those who give up without a fight.
I'll remind you to keep your sniveling philosophies to yourself.
Now get forward and stay away from my men.
As you wish, Captain.
Carry on.
Lee! Please, don't do it.
Come in.
Yes, Captain?
Still upset about that news blackout?
As a matter of fact, I am, sir.
And more than that, this man Alvarez is trying to subvert the crew.
If I'm gonna meet your deadline in the Marianas,
I need fighters, not fatalists.
Then order Alvarez to keep away from the crew.
I've already done that.
But if I might suggest, sir...
it would help if you treat the crew as men and not like children.
If you'djust let them in on your plans.!
That has always been my intention,
Captain, but only at the proper time.
- Sparks!
- Sir?
- What luck with Washington?
- Static's gettin'worse, sir.
That Miami pickup was just a freak.
Now all contact's blacked out.
Very well.
Now what?
If you can't reach the president-
- I haven't given up trying.
- But the radio-
- Where are we now, Captain?
- Sir?
Just exactly where are we?
- We're right here, sir.
- Good.
Set a course, close in toward Cape de Sao Roque.
May I ask why, sir?
Static caused by magnetic storms may knock out radio, but it won't affect a telephone cable.
- Telephone cable?
- Yes, Lucius, right here.
Our mine detectors should locate it easily where it crosses the continental shelf.
- Have Engineering rig a tapping device.
- And tap the cable?
If we can't reach the president by radio, we'll tap the cable and phone him... over the Rio-to-London telephone cable.
I like that, Harry.
Thank you.
- Check your mask.
- Right.
- Check.
- Alvarez, I thought I asked for volunteers.
- That's right.
- A little out of character, aren't you?
Hardly out of character, Captain.
Undersea work was part of my job.
All right, let's move out.
- All clear?
- Clear.
Secure the hatch.
- Hatch secure.
- Prepare to flood.
- Ready here.
- Divers ready.
Slow flood.
Slow flood.
- Let's hope this works.
- I wouldn't count on it.
- There's the signal. They've found it.
- Where?
Right out there.
- Get Sparks.
- I can't see anything but the signal.
Stand by, Sparks.
They've located the cable.
- Should be a connection in a minute.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Connection made, Admiral.
Hello? Hello?
This is submarine Seaview.
Can anybody hear us?
- Hello?
- Something's coming in.
- Can you hear us?
- This is London.
Hello?
This is London speaking.
Can you hear me, London?
This is submarine Seaview, Admiral Nelson.
I hear you, Seaview.
Go ahead.
Could you patch me through to Washington?
Hello? Hello?
Come in, London.
Sorry, sir, not a chance.
We've been out of contact with the States for 35 hours.
There's no answer on either the north or south cables.
Harry, we'll never get through.
Could you relay a call through the telephone satellite?
Impossible.
The whole system's flooded out.
London's been evacuated, and-
Hello? Hello?
Come in, London.
Are you there? Hello?
- Break the connection, Sparks. Order that last man in.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Lee?
Oh, am I glad to see you!
Am I glad to see you.
What do you say, Doc?
Apparently, no ribs broken.
You're very fortunate, Captain.
He's all right.
Where's Alva-Thanks.
It was a perfect shot.
Saved my life.
- My hand was guided by the Lord.
- Perhaps.
- But I'm glad your fatalism didn't run its obvious course.
- Lee!
I'm sorry.
That was uncalled for.
- Thanks.
- Oh.
This will have to be seen to, Doctor.
- Bring him to sick bay.
- Please come this way.
- How about you, Romano?
- In the pink, Captain.
- Good.
- You had me kind of worried there for a minute.
- I had myself worried.
- Lee, are you all right?
Well, I'm still in one piece.
What's the news, Admiral?
Disastrous. For all they know, there isn't any Washington.
- No London either from the sound of things.
- What do we do now?
Let's get the ship under way, then have the crew stand by for an announcement.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Lucius.
I'm about to make the most important decision of my life, and I'd like you there.
- Connors.
- Yes, sir.
- Sparks?
- Sir.
- Pipe this through the ship.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Ready, sir.
Now hear this.
Men, this is a time for decision.
You heard the tragic news over the cable.
Contact with Washington is now impossible.
This means we can't get presidential approval of my plan.
Therefore, the final decision must be made now.
There are only two choices.
So with higher directives unavailable and by the authority vested in me...
I have made that final decision.
We are headed for the Marianas to fire the missile.
Now, it's a race against time...
a countdown of only 14 days in which to cross half the world.
If we are to win that race, and we must...
sacrifices will become daily obligations.
The new work schedule will be posted immediately.
And I tell you now, it's a rough one.
just one thing more.
Our world faces its darkest hour... but I am convinced that, with God's help... my plan will succeed and the world will survive.
That is all.
- Doctor.
- Captain.
- Just checking on Alvarez.
- He went forward with Dr. Jamieson.
- Seems to be all right.
- Good.
I wish I could say the same of some of the others.
- George Young.
- Mm-hmm.
I've given him a sedative.
Nervous hysteria.
After all, Doctor, he just became a new father... and it's only his second trip.
It's not necessarily a question of experience.
Now, here's a veteran, your engineer, Lieutenant Hodges.
Lieutenant.
What seems to be your problem, Mr. Hodges?
Just don't feel good, sir.
I'll be okay in an hour or so.
You try and get some rest.
We'll manage.
- Yes, sir.
- Doctor.
- What happened to him?
- Same thing. Hyper neurasthenia.
Your crew is like a capped oil well.
When tension builds up, there's bound to be an explosion.
But these are handpicked men.
Therefore with eyes to see and minds that question.
They know the world's probably on the brink of oblivion... but instead of trying to get to their homes and finding their families... here they are, racing under the sea... driven on by one man's wild scheme, which has no proven scientific basis.
Doctor, this is a submarine, not a nursery school.
- And the admiral's orders must be obeyed.
- I wonder.
Professionally, I am interested to know if the admiral always behaves this way.
- This ruthless compulsion that-
- Doctor. Doctor.
Excuse me.
- Where are we, Romano?
- Sub's right here, Skipper. We ought to raise the-
- Engine Room, what happened?
- The generator's gone out, sir.
- How bad?
- Don't know yet, sir. We're checking.
- All stop!
- All stop, sir.
- What is it, Lee?
- It's the generator. They're checking on it now.
- It's an armature, Captain.
- How long to fix?
- About 10 hours.
- We can't afford to wait 10 hours.
It's dangerous not to wait.
Radar and sonar are both knocked out.
- We can't move without 'em.
- Yes, we can.
There's nothing wrong with the motors.
As for sonar and radar... these are safe waters.
Keep moving and rush those repairs.
That's an order, Captain.
- All ahead two-thirds.
- All ahead two-thirds.
Get on those repairs on the double.
- Hello.
- Oh.
- Oh, you startled me. It's so dark in here.
- I'm sorry.
Well, I'm the one that's sorry.
I didn't thank you for saving Lee.
That was a very brave thing you did, risking your life to save his.
We'll all die when our time comes.
You really believe the world is coming to an end?
Yes, I do.
I had time to think about it out there on the ice.
At first, I was puzzled.
But then I began to see things clearly.
As a child,
I was pledged to the church... but my mind was filled with doubts... enough to make me turn my back on my chosen path.
But out there, the fire burned away my doubts... and I saw the truth... crystal clear in my mind and in my heart.
- I found peace again.
- And resignation?
Has man a right to even try to oppose God's will?
Why should God want to destroy us?
Haven't we tried to destroy ourselves?
I don't agree with anything you say.
I won't.
I doesn't matter. Perhaps our death comes even sooner than the others.
Mines!
Lee! Mines, mines!
Dead ahead!
Hundreds of mines.!
- All stop!
- All stop.
- Take over.
- Aye, aye, sir.
It's caught in the searchlight casing, sir.
- All back. Dead slow.
- All back. Dead slow.
- Hold it! All stop!
- All stop!
We've got to clear it from the outside.
Frogmen.
No, we're too deep. Use the minisub and a torch. Burn through the cable.
- Minisub in all these mines?
- Can you think of a better idea, Captain?
I could a couple of hours ago when I suggested we wait for repairs.
You made your point.
The responsibility is now mine.
Aye, aye, sir.
Harry, take it easy.
This is the captain.
We're in the middle of a minefield.
A cable is caught on the forward searchlight.
I need two volunteers for the minisub.
- Gleason, sir. I'll go.
- Right, Gleason.
Okay, Red, here's your chance for that joyride.
Smith, sir.
Count on me.
- Right, Smith.
- Hey, that's young Jimmy.
Now, look, this is a pretty touchy situation, so play it cool.
Aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Good luck.
Damage Patrol, stand by!
What are your orders now, sir?
Back out of the minefield dead slow.
Then proceed with caution until the generator is fixed.
Aye, aye, sir.
All back.
Dead slow.
All back. Dead slow.
Are you all right, sir?
Huh? Yes, yes, of course, Connors.
Perfectly all right.
Are you, Harry?
Gleason was a good man.
So was young Smith.
LittleJimmy.
Look, you have no right to brood, Harry.
You had to take a gamble. Otherwise, your entire plan would have been wrecked.
The commodore's right, sir.
If the generator hadn't gone out-
- You're both very kind, thank you.
- Kind? No, I think-
Hey, that's pretty good, isn't it?
Only about six hours.
What do you say, Connors?
- What's that?
- Nothing important.
It seems that, uh, somebody's concerned about my health and welfare.
Huh?
- Yes?
- This is the captain.
Please come to the sick bay, sir, at once.
- Very well.
- Now what?
Let's find out.
Come along, Connors.
- Hodges?
- He smashed in the medicine chest and swallowed these, Admiral.
He must've typed that note on my machine.
"I was to blame for the death of Gleason and Smith.
I sabotaged the generator... although only God knows why
I did this terrible thing. "
- Sabotage?
- He wasn't responsible, Admiral.
It was a severe nervous breakdown.
That's beside the point, Doctor.
All right, Captain. You blamed me for the death of Gleason and Smith... but here is positive proof that those men were victims... not of my impatience, but of deliberate sabotage.
- Any comments?
- Yes, sir.
Sabotage might be just the beginning.
You're driving my crew to the point of exhaustion... possibly even rebellion.
These are men, not machines.
If they break down or blow up, we'll never meet your deadline.
We'll meet it because we have to meet it.
I'm not worried that your men can't take it. They can.
But I am concerned about your alternative: rebellion.
I found this note in my cabin... just a few minutes ago.
"If you continue your lunatic project, you'll never live to see it completed. "
Hodges will never see it completed.
And he won't bother you anymore.
I'm not so sure that he did.
These notes were not typed on the same machine.
Double the security guard.
All men off duty are restricted to quarters.
Until proved otherwise, everyone is suspect.
- Lee? Don't turn against the admiral.
- I'm not turning against anybody.
Lee, let's not argue, please.
Not now.
Not now.
Lieutenant.
There is something you can do to help.
Take this note sent to the admiral.
- Run a test sample on all the typewriters.
- I don't have to.
The dot's off the small "I."
This was typed on my machine.
- In the admiral's office, Cathy?
- Yes.
- Captain, may I speak freely?
- Please do.
You're so concerned about your crew that you're overlooking other danger signs.
Admiral Nelson's becoming a textbook case.
Taciturnity combined with anxiety, high irritability.
- And now, perhaps delusions of persecution.
- Delusions?
The admiral could've typed that threatening note himself.
Susan! How can you consider such a thing?
Cathy.
Thanks very much for your diagnosis,
Dr. Hiller.
The admiral is showing signs of strain.
However, I'm sure he's in complete command of his senses.
I hope so.
We still have a long way to go.
Fire in the admiral's cabin!
Lee! The admiral's cabin!
- Step up the power to the ventilators!
- Lee! Lee!
It's not smoke.
Look up here. It's gas!
Surface! Surface!
Ship off the port side, sir.
Glasses.
Looks becalm.
On the ship! On the ship!
Do you read me?
Do you read me?
On the ship.!
Do you read me?
Shall I send out a boat, sir?
We can't proceed until we ventilate anyway.
Very well.
Rescue team, up and out on the double.
Check forward.
Check aft.
Let's go.
Dead.
They're all dead.
Let's go.
- What'd you see out there?
- Dead men.
Dead men on a dead ship.
Ain't it about time we went home?
Yeah. You've all got families, haven't you? Well, how about it?
Leave it to me!
- Yes, Lieutenant?
- It's a complete derelict, sir.
Just four days out of Honolulu.
Everyone's dead.
The heat, no water.
We found this in the bar.
It's the Hawaiian Times.
It's dated last Thursday.
I've been asked to speak for some of the crew, sir.
- What is it, Kowski?
- We've been feeling this way for days, but-
- Well, I guess that dead ship brought it to a head.
- Brought what to a head?
Sir, the men feel if it's really the end coming... they ought to be spending their last hours with their wives and families.
Now, we respectfully demand, sir, that you take us back home.
I see.
May I remind all of you that this is a government ship.
Demands made by a crewman or an officer could be considered mutiny.
Shall I so consider it?
Well, speak up!
Captain, as a civilian, may I say a word?
The world may end at any minute now.
Certainly at such a time, these men have a right to choose where to die and with whom.
- Listen, Mr. Alvarez- - Just a minute,
Captain. Mr. Alvarez makes a valid point.
I do not believe the world is ending.
If I did,
I'd be heading for home myself.
But in fairness to everyone, there is some recent news... that may have a bearing on your decision.
It comes from a Honolulu newspaper found on the derelict yacht.
The headline reads: "World Subs Ordered to Stop Seaview from Firing Missile. "
So in addition to all our other problems, we are now a hunted ship... and we may never get a chance to fire the missile.
This in no way alters my plans.
This ship will hold its course.
But in view of this news and your request... the men who want to go home may do so on that yacht.
I think you're fools to try it...
but I'll supply sufficient water... and food to give you a good fighting chance.
Admiral, if we're to meet your deadline to the Marianas... it's madness to split this crew.
- In view of the threat of mutiny, we-
- It's not mutiny yet, Captain.
Your challenge was not taken up by the men.
All our trouble stems from the fanatical desire... on the part of some- not all of them- to go home.
I'd rather have a small loyal crew than risk further sabotage.
- Admiral-
- That's enough, Captain.
Men, you have 15 minutes to make your decision.
Please have any in the sick bay that want to go placed aboard the yacht.
One of you doctors better go along.
The other, stay here.
Dr. Jamieson, I would say that this looks like a job for you.
- Yes, sir.
- Get the supplies rolling, Captain. Excuse me.
- All clear on deck!
- Very well. Captain, take her down.
- Take her down! Hundred feet.
- Hundred feet, flood negative.
- Are you all right, Admiral?
- Perfectly all right, thanks to Captain Crane.
Well, Mr. Alvarez,
I see you decided to stay with us.
Stay or go-what's the difference?
What's to be will be.
- That guy gets on my nerves.
- Cheerful, isn't he?
Stern's under. Deck's awash.
- Full speed ahead, Captain.
- One moment, sir.
Lieutenant, I ask you to take official note of my protest... against the admiral's actions.
- Actions?
- Yes, sir.
Despite my objection, you encouraged desertion.
I can't argue with that. You're within your rights to record a protest.
But, Lieutenant, you can also record this.
Desertion or not, we're better off without a murderer on board.
The note I found was no idle warning.
That fire in my cabin was deliberately set.
Begging your pardon, sir.
Romano.
Fire detail found a cigar burning on the floor, sir.
- Meaning I was smoking in bed?
- Apparently, sir.
Apparently, sir. Except I ran out of cigars before I went to bed.
Lieutenant, file the captain's report.
Then have my cabin cleaned up.
I'm going to check supplies... for more cigars.
Delusions are typical in cases like this.
- I'll be in my quarters.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Yes?
Hi.
Buy you a cup of coffee?
- Look, Lee-
- Now, wait-wait just a minute.
I appreciate your blind loyalty to the admiral.
I felt that way myself until his lunatic actions started to follow a pattern.
- Lunatic actions?
- All right, is this rational?
No search for survivors on Ice Floe Delta.
Crash-dived in New York with police on deck.
Sent a minisub into a minefield which killed two of my men.
- He had to take the chance.
- Drove a fine officer to sabotage and suicide.
Produced a threatening note which he probably wrote himself.
Then he dreamed up this so-called murder attempt... which was actually his smoking in bed.
- I believe him.
- And now, the final straw! He approves of desertion... when we desperately need every able-bodied man on this sub.
- Lord knows what he'll do next.
- Or what you'll do next. Is that it?
"Procedure under which a subordinate officer... may relieve a superior of his command. "
- That's just in case.
- Of what?
If I decide the admiral is irresponsible.
Irresponsible?
Then what are you going to do about the missile? It has to be fired.
Why? If the admiral is crazy, his plan is crazy too.
The U.N. thought so. They've got subs out looking for us right now.
Well, Professor Emery believes in it.
I'm sorry, but until I say so, the matter's closed.
Sir.
Less than eight degrees to Dr. Zucco's burn-out point.
Let's hope he's right.
Hang it up.
- What's our position?
- Guam's due south of us, sir. Just 12 miles to target.
- Yes?
- This is the captain.
We're 12 miles and 50 minutes to zero.
Uh, missile ready for firing?
- All ready, sir.
- I'll speak to the ship.
- Sparks, pipe the admiral though the ship.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Go ahead, sir.
This is the admiral.
The missile is primed... and in exactly 49 minutes it will be fired.
Shortly thereafter, we should know... if our long voyage across the world has been justified.
With luck, we'll soon be on our way home.
That is all.
Connors, we're all out of aspirin here.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'll get some.
- Susan, where do you keep the aspirin?
- Top drawer, over there.
Thank you.
- Lucius, what happened to you?
- Oh, nothing.
I got a little too close to one of my sharks. You know Bessie.
- Will he be all right, Doctor?
- It's not serious, Admiral.
I thought Bessie was a friend of your-
Lieutenant, you should be on duty.
Not me, sir.
I'm beat.
- Aren't we all? Get forward.
- Sorry, sir.
As a sick man,
I take my orders from the doctor.
Sick, huh?
In my judgment, you're faking.
With due respect, sir, I think your judgment's been a little rocky lately.
Why, you goldbricking pip-squeak!
What brought that on?
- Go on, tell him.
- I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
Tell him.
First, the doctor tells me to rest.
Then the admiral comes in and orders me back to duty, then pow.
Doctor, I request you certify the admiral as irresponsible, if you agree.
- What?
- I certainly do, Captain.
Master at Arms,
Sick Bay on the double.
Hold it, sir. It was all my fault.
I was disrespectful.
- Captain, you can't arrest the admiral.
- Of course you can't, Lee.
Any other decision would be dangerous for everybody else on board.
Captain, that missile's scheduled to be fired at 4. 00.
Are you still going to permit this?
I guarantee the admiral's plan is sound.
Dr. Zucco and our finest scientific minds don't agree.
- Dr. Zucco.
- You can't do it, and I'm going to warn him.
Lieutenant, confine yourself to your quarters. That's an order.
Follow me.
- Yes?
- Dr. Hiller, this is the admiral.
- Is the captain still there?
- He has just gone forward, Admiral.
Sir.
Sir, I deeply regret this, but under federal regulations...
number 249, governing conduct on the high seas...
I am forced to relieve you of your command.
Arrest?
- Not arrest, sir. I'm placing you on sick list.
- And if I refuse?
I'm afraid you have no choice.
I must also inform you of this, sir.
- I've decided not to fire the missile.
- Lee, for the love of heaven-
Most of the scientists agree the fire will burn itself out at 173 degrees.
I'll wait and see.
Lee,you must fire that missile at 4. 00, or we lose the angle of trajectory.
- Detail.
- Captain, this is Sonar.
- Detail.
- Captain, this is Sonar.
Unidentified fast propellers bearing 0-9-0... about 2,000 yards astern.
They've found us.
Torpedo approaching to starboard!
Left full rudder.
Battle stations. Take off.
Sparks, contact that sub and tell them we're not firing the missile.
Sonar, switch pickup into the P.A.
Battle stations!
Battle stations!
- Move! Move!
- Battle stations!
Whew. Too close.
Sparks, can't you reach that sub?
- There's no answer, sir.
- Rig for attack! Ready torpedoes!
No, no! We can't fire on a U.N. sub.
We've got to make a run for it.
Torpedoes approaching starboard!
Left full rudder!
- We're a sitting duck. Dive!
- I'm giving orders aboard this ship.
I'm not challenging that, but I built this ship!
We can take the pressure of the Mariana
Trench. That sub can't dive as deep.
- Dive, Lee, dive, for heaven's sake!
- Dive, dive!
Dive! Dive!
- 400 feet!
- 1,200 feet.
- 1,200.
- 1,400 feet.
- 2,300 feet.
- 2,300.
- 2,500 feet.
Torpedoes approaching port side.
Right full rudder!
Fools.
They'd better get up fast.
- 3,200 feet.
- She'll blow!
- All stop! Check for damage!
- All stop!
Damage Control, make check!
Fire detail, on the double!
Return to stations!
Return to stations!
- Full emergency power.!
- Full emergency power!
All full!
Captain, this is Sonar. We're picking up something else, real close.
- Well, it can't be another sub.
- Not at this depth.
Lee, what the-
Power Room, reactors up full.
Shoot a charge through the hull.
Aye, aye, sir.
It must give way.
- Full emergency power!
- Full emergency power.!
It's breaking loose.
That did it, Lee.
- All ahead full.
- All ahead full.
Now what happened?
Power Room. Power Room!
- Power Room! Power Room!
- No answer?
Negative.
Control Room, what happened to the reactors?
- Don't know, sir. Theyjust quit.
- I'll find out myself.
The admiral's scheme is suicidal insanity.
If you pick up a fatal dose of radiation, it glows red.
You gotta stop the admiral.
He'll destroy the world.
Doctor, what were you doing in there?
Making sure you don't reach your target position by 4:00.
So you were the saboteur.
Control Room!
Switch to auxiliary, fast!
Aye, aye, sir.
Moving on batteries, sir.
Very well.
What's the temperature reading?
173.2, and the fire's still burning.
I knew it. Zucco was wrong.
There is no burn-out point.
Stand by to fire.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Sail camera, prepare to track missile.
Sail camera on. Missile Room, stand by, number eight tube.
- Missile Room standing by.
- Target position in 10 minutes.
This is the missile room.
Hatch opening now.
We've made it, Alvarez.
We'll fire that missile on time.
I think not, Admiral.
- Alvarez!
- No man has a right to challenge God's will.
Have you gone completely mad?
Put down that bomb.
Man has sown the seeds of sin.
Now he will reap the whirlwind.
Everybody, stand still.
Lieutenant, get away from the missile button.
Don't move, Admiral.
Hold it!
Attention, everyone!
This is Alvarez.
I have a bomb.
- A bomb?
- If anybody tries to fire the missile...
I'll blow up this ship.
Captain Crane, wherever you are, see that no one interferes.
- Cathy.
- Commodore, where's Lee?
Come on. We have no time to lose.
We must find him.
- Lee!
- What's the matter?
What's the matter, my boy?
- What happened?
- Alvarez has a bomb.
He's holding the ship at bay.
We've only got a few minutes, and the missile's got to be fired.
Alvarez is covering the control room.
- There must be some other way.
- You go to your quarters.
Only eight more minutes, Admiral... and it will be too late for you to do anything.
Diving gear, on the double.
- Which hatch is opened?
- Number eight, sir,just under the bridge.
Alvarez, for heaven's sake, man, come to your senses.
If the missile isn't fired in six minutes-
It won't be. God's will is written across the heavens.
Alvarez, are you saying... that man must accept destruction even though it's in his power to avert it?
It's not for us to judge, Admiral.
Freeze!
Not tojudge, maybe, but we can reason.
If God ordains that man should die without a fight... then why does he give us the will to live?
Your time's run out, Admiral.
This is the admiral.
Surface! Surface!
Surface! Surface!
- You did it!
- Lucius, we did it.
- Admiral, sir.
- Lieutenant.
- Thank your, sir.
- Good luck, lad.
- Thank you.
- Admiral?
Lee.
- Full speed for home, Lee.
- Aye, aye, sir.

Even at night, if it takes too long...
What is it that they want us to take?
A human being, perhaps.

Hardly.
Germany has reached the end of her line.
We'd appreciate it, if it's a powerful secret weapon!
Standing by to take over delivery!

Is it so important?
They sent it all the way from Germany and even sacrificed a submarine for it?
HIROSHIMA ARMY HOSPITAL
Salute!
Thank you for your trouble, but I'm afraid you were a bit late.
Why, sir?
I mean we aren't ready, nor do we have the time for further research work.
Here.
The key, sir.
You want to see what is inside, don't you?
Yes, sir.
The thing you risked your life to bring back.
It's Frankenstein's heart.
Frankenstein?
Is it a living heart?
It will never die.
Never die?
Have you ever heard about Frankenstein?
Yes, I have, but not in detail.
A long time ago, a German scientist named Frankenstein sewed up...
...a corpse that had been cut into little pieces...
...and used electric shocks to revive it.
Is this for an important research?
To make soldiers who will never die from getting shot.
Are you trying to pull my leg, Doctor?
I really mean it.
If we could solve the mystery of this heart as well as...
...the activities of the cell bodies...
...80 to 90% of the soldiers who die in wars could be saved.
AUGUST 6TH, 1945
15 YEARS LATER
Take care of yourselves.
I'll come again.
How do you feel?
Please take this, Doctor.
For me?
Yes.
Thank you very much for everything.
It's very beautiful. Thank you.
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.
That's fine.
She knows her end is near.
Perhaps so. She is a bright girl.
Yes.
That's why she hurried to finish this embroidery for you.
Please look, Dr. Bowen.
The cells that have been exposed to twice the lethal dose of radiation have...
...become active.
Did she die?
Tazuko Towoi in Ward No.11...
It's worse than death.
She lingers on, wondering from day to day when she'll die.
It's a shame that our research work...
...hasn't reached the point where we can save her.
Her parents were also killed by the A-bomb, weren't they?
All alone since she was a baby...
How can we describe her life'?
The story of Hiroshima is too tragic.
But it's also a fact that it has given us...
...the opportunity to study the cellular tissues of the human body.
We must work to turn tragedy into eternal peace and happiness in the future.
Did you see a strange-looking boyjust now?
- Yes, he ran in that direction.
- Would you believe it'?
He killed our dog and took it with him.
I think he's going to eat it.
Is he a waif?
There were lots of them just after the war. Please be careful.
- There's no telling what he'll do.
- Yes.
I'm the first!
- Second!
- Third!
What's up?
A rabbit!
Teachefl
Teacher! Teacher!
A DEGENERATE?
DEAD RABBIT IN SCHOOL ROOM
Your kimono is very becoming, Doctor.
Thank you.

~ Oh! ay t° Y°u.
Thank you very much. Please come in.
This way, please.
Thank you.
Please sit down.
Thank you.
I'm afraid it's a very modest meal.
Thank you.
It's good, isn't it?
How do you make this soup'?
- First I put dried fish in...
- No...
That's second. First, you scoop up some dried fish.
It takes time to learn to understand American humor.
Japanese humor is very hard to grasp too.
Please.
Thank you.
Are you going to remain in Japan to carry on your research work?
I am afraid not.
But what about your research?
Sueko, I came here after the war, because I was one of the people...
...concerned about the A-bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima.
I wanted to spend my life rehabilitating mankind, not in destroying it.
But...
But?
But the more research work I do, the more I am troubled by doubts.
So I'm thinking of returning to
America to start all over again.
Drop dead!
You're not hurt'?
That boy.
That boy'?
The waif I told you about the other day.
Wait a minute.
Working on Sunday?
Doctor...
They don't have any Sundays either.
Do you remember Tazuko Towoi?
Yes. Today is the anniversary of her death.
Don't squint at bacteria all the time.
How about driving out to visit Tazuko's grave?
Yes, I'd love to.
Thank you, Doctor.
Her grave is up on the mountain in back.
Let's go.
There's a waif!
Come on. Hurry!
Waif?
Let's go.
It's dangerous, Children. Stay away.
Come out!
He's the boy from that night?
I can'tjust shoot him.
Does he really eat dogs and cats?
Yes. Chickens and rabbits too.
He's just like a wild beast himself.
He's gone farther inside.
Go around to the back.
Say, don't try to run away! Come out!
Hurry, come out!
Come out!
No use trying to get away!
Come out!
We'll bring him out, so please send everyone away.
- No, it's dangerous.
- I've fed him once.
Too many will only upset him.
Leave us alone.
Please be careful then.
Come out.
There's nothing to worry about. Come out.
Come out. No one will hurt you.
Please don't use a flash.
We don't want him to go on a rampage.
Drink this.
Strange to say, this boy's a Caucasian.
- A half-caste abandoned by a prostitute?
- No, he is a full-blooded white boy.
He received radiation when he was a baby.
And the important point is that he did not develop radiation poisoning.
Instead, his body is building up strong resistance to radiation.
Radiation?
I can't believe a white boy was abandoned just after the end of the war.
Wasn't he born much later than that?
In any case, he's very important from a scientific point of view.
I'd like your help in finding out who his parents are, where he was born...
...and in what sort of environment he grew up.
AKITA OIL FIELDS
It says there's a boy in Hiroshima who shows a strong resistance to radiation.
VICTIM OF A-BOMB? A WAIF HAVING
STRONG RESISTANCE TO RADIATION
Hundreds of thousands of people were killed.
I wouldn't be surprised if a child like that was born.
You said you saw a heart in Hiroshima that will never stop beating, didn't you?
Yes.
It's a silly story.
So many peculiar things happened around the time the war ended.
An earthquake?
It seems like a big one.
Run for it!
Run!
Run to the mountain in back!
Hurry! Run!
Are you all right?
Hurry!
He doesn't show any signs of recognizing words.
He has strange blue eyes.
Could it be caused by anemia?
No.
Why are you so violent?
Eat quietly.
Miss Togami.
He won't harm me.
Now, sit down.
Anyway, we'd better put him in a cage or chain him...
He grows with amazing speed. ls it due to radiation?
If we only knew that, we could say we'd half succeeded in our research work.
As far as we know, radiation is detrimental to human beings.
I'm back.
How was it?
There were four hundred letters, including those sent to newspapers...
...and TV stations.
I went through all of them, but none were of any help.
I see.
However, one of the letters says he may be the boy that used to be...
...seen playing in the ruins of the Army Hospital.
- At the Army Hospital?
- Yes.
I went to see the sender, but I couldn't find out anything about his parents...
...just that he'd been seen playing in the ruins.
- Alone?
- Yes, always alone.
But even if the story is true...
...how could he have grown up there from the time he was a helpless baby...
...if he were all alone?
He has become so big we had to put him in here.
He still grows like a baby.
Why is that?
We don't know.
- Is he ever violent?
- No, he isn't.
It'sjust a precautionary measure.
I'd like to go in and take some pictures.
Please do.
Is it safe'?
Yes, while I am with him.
Wait a minute. I'll bring you something to eat right away.
We don't know when he will become violent.
We can't keep him here any longer.
We've decided to build a place for him with the laboratory budget.
So only until it is completed...
- I'm afraid I can't give you an answer alone.
- What do you suggest then?
How about asking the Zoo to keep him?
He's a human being!
He's precious. There's no one like him in the whole world.
Dr. Kawaji and Dr. Togami, please return to the laboratory at once!
I don't know if I'll be of any help or not, but...
I couldn't forget the news of the boy who had grown up in the...
...ruins of the Army Hospital.
Just after Berlin fell, we received
Frankenstein's heart from a German submarine...
...and delivered it to the
Army Hospital in Hiroshima.
I heard then that the heart would never die.
Did you see it?
Yes.
Was it alive'?
Yes.
It was preserved in liquid.
It was beating regularly.
But how the heart...
Why did they bring it to Japan?
I was told that they'd make soldiers who'd recover instantly from bullet wounds.
It was a study on the activities of the cell bodies that...
...would never die as long as you replenish protein to them.
Let's find the scientists in Germany who were involved in this at that time.
FRANKFURT, GERMANY
What you would like to know is...
...whether the creature in Hiroshima is Frankenstein or not, isn't it'?
Yes, sir.
Dr. Frankenstein's monster that you are talking about...
It is said the monster died many times, but always came back to life.
However, its heart has never died.
Not even once.
If the protein supply is sufficient, the active cells will quickly mend the body.
Even if the arms are cut off, new ones will grow on again.
When you return to Japan, cut off his arm or leg.
If he is Frankenstein, he will grow new ones.
Moreover, I'm sure the arms or legs that have been cut off will also live on.
Here's your food.
Doesn't it hurt'?
But it's eating into your wrist.
I'll order a larger chain at once.
You must be tired.
Is anything wrong?
It's nothing.
Let's ask Sueko's opinion too.
Dr. Togami's certain to oppose it.
What are you two talking about?
I met Dr. Rissendorf in Frankfurt.
He said that...
...the only way to prove whether he's
Frankenstein or not is to cut off...
...his arm and leg.
If a new arm or leg grows in again, he's Frankenstein without a doubt.
I'm absolutely against such a cruel thing!
There's no other way to find out.
What if no new arm or leg grows back on?
He's not a human being anyway.
You refused to let him be sent to a zoo by insisting he's a human, didn't you?
But just as gorillas aren't human beings, right now he's...
N0! He's a human being.
So was Frankenstein.
He wasn't an ordinary human being.
- He was man-made.
- Even so, a human beingjust the same!
Let's think it over carefully. lt would be terrible if we made a mistake.
It's good.
Thank you. Thank you.
I cook mine too long.
It's simple. First, be sure to get good meat.
No, that's second.
First, you lasso a big cow, don't you?
Dr. Kawaji's late, isn't he?
He said he had some work left, but I'm sure he'll be here soon.
Say, be careful! Steps here!
Camera here!
- Listen, who's in charge here? Are you?
- We're from a TV station.
The hospital official gave us the go-ahead to take pictures.
It's okay to take pictures.
But he's really in a bad humor although he seems quiet enough.
I wish he'd cut up a little.
He's not worth filming as he is now.
It's no joke.
Ready?
Lights okay.
- Ready! Start shooting!
- Stop!
- Stop it! Stop, I tell you!
- Please don't come out!
Is it safe'?
Turn off the lights! Turn them off!
- Lights off!
- Amazing.
Run! Run!
The monster's become loose!
The phone!
Call the police!
Hello!
Hello! Get me the hospital official!
The hospital official, please!
Hospital official? ls anything wrong with the Boy?
He's cut his chain and has become loose! ls Dr. Bowen there?
Yes, he is.
- Please ask him to come over at once!
- Yes!
I'll go too.
No, it's dangerous!
The boy will listen to me. He needs me.
He's no longer a boy.
We're in terrible trouble.
What can we do?
Gather all the fire extinguishers!
We'll blind him! And get ropes!
Bring all the fire extinguishers!
Hurry, hurry!
It's dangerous! Don't go too near!
Go!
Don't kill him!
Don't kill him!
At 7:30 tonight, the giant that was being kept at the laboratory of the International...
Institute of Radiotherapeutics became wild and has suddenly disappeared.
Emergency orders have been issued.
AII the police force and firemen are requested to return to their positions...
and wait for further orders.
I will repeat...
What is it?
Wait!
You can't escape!
Wait!
Come back!
Over there! Over there!
Regardless of all the sacrifices, you believe that he shouldn't be killed?
Yes!
He is very important scientifically!
It is not for us to decide whether he should be killed or not.
But as scientists, we can only say we hope that he will not be killed.
- Weren't those deaths due to negligence?
- Yes.
The problem is what sort of chain was used on him.
Let's check and see!
It's very strange.
Was the handcuff too big?
That's it! It must have slipped off.
They should be held responsible for it then.
I don't see anything.
It was here! I'm sure it was!
It's strange!
Doctor, it's Frankenstein!
There's no doubt about it!
Frankenstein, did you say?
The movement seems to have become slower.
Yes.
I'll make the protein culture solution at once. We must keep the hand alive.
What a surprise!
Now, we can't shoot him, can we?
- Are you going to kill him'?
- ls there any other way of killing him?
I don't think he'll offer any resistance if I go.
Can you stay with him 24 hours every day all year round?
Hello.
For you.
Thank you.
Hello.
There was trouble at a hog ranch in Okayama!
What about it?
A hog ranch! Five hogs were killed!
Are you telling me that
Frankenstein went to Okayama?
What else can we think?
Ate everything except the bone and skin!
All right! I'll be right back!
He's escaped to Okayama!
It's out of our hands then, sir?
Don't look so relieved yet.
OKAYAMA
An emergency announcement!
An emergency announcement!
It has been confirmed that Frankenstein is somewhere in the vicinity...
of Okayama City.
According to the Hiroshima Police...
he hunts for food mostly during the night...
and remains in the mountains and valleys during the daytime.
Anyone who sees him, please report it...
to the nearest police station or to the city office.
Be sure to listen in on all news about him from now on.
Eyewitnesses say that he is four times bigger than a human being.
He's grown bigger since he left Hiroshima.
He's so big and you haven't found him yet?
Our patrol cars are of no use.
And he can think like a human being which makes it even worse.
Yes.
What I would like to say, sir, is that he's always a jump ahead of us.
What do you want me to do?
We need tanks more than patrol cars.
That's being considered already at a higher level.
- Will they be in time for tonight?
- You're...
It's imperative that we take every precaution tonight.
- Okay.
- Yes.
- A success, isn't it?
- Yes, it's a success!
Has it been revived?
Look closely, the nails seem to have grown longer too.
The hand will be able to remain active now...
...without the aid of the electro-magnetic device, won't it?
It only needs nourishment now.
HIMEJI CASTLE
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
This place is right in the middle of the city, so I guess he wouldn't come here.
I guess not, but I'd like to get a look at him if he's so big.
Scared, but you want to see him?
Help!
OSAKA
OSAKA POLICE HEADQUARTERS
Yes?
Oh, they are here.
- Hello.
- Thank you for coming. Hello.
How do you do?
We're sorry to trouble you, but we decided to request your presence...
...in case something completely unexpected came up.
Please sit down.
Thank you.
I hope we can help you.
Do you think Frankenstein has any purpose in coming to Kyoto, Osaka, or Kobe?
Not particularly, since he does not know the cities you mentioned.
You insisted at first, did you not, on not having him killed?
As a scientist, I still do.
But as you know, we have preserved his hand...
...so if you decide that he must be killed after all the harm he has done...
...we will bow to the inevitable...
...and will not try to prevent it.
Hello.
What? Lake Biwa'?
Something 500 meters ahead!
- Slow speed ahead!
- Slow speed ahead!
- Hard starboard 15°.
- Hard starboard 15°.
Captain!
Calm down! Calm down!
There's nothing we can do but go home.
He's right.
But we have his hand.
We can still continue our studies with it.
HATO
- ls anything wrong?
- Yes...
The hand's gone!
What?
When'? When did it happen?
I noticed it when I came to work this morning.
There's not a single drop of fluid left...
Look for it again, all of you! Hurry!
Dr. Bowen!
Find it?
It's dead!
But it's grown very large!
We made a great mistake. The larger it became, the more protein it needed.
MT. IBUKI
HEIKE-DAKE
DAINICHI-DAKE
SHIRAKA WA VILLAGE
- Thank you for coming.
- Glad to be of help.
Where did you see him?
This morning at the w00dcutter's hut.
It was destroyed by a big log that flew through the air, they say.
How about the village?
Nothing seems to be wrong there.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, sir!
It's a boar!
Is it cold in the Japanese Alps?
Yes.
People can ski in the snow valleys there even in summer.
He instinctively seeks a climate like that of Frankfurt.
That is, a cold place.
I imagine the coolness of the
Japanese Alps has pleased him.
Yes, Frankfurt's situated in latitude 50°N.
Why did he return to the warm lowlands again then'?
There isn't enough food containing protein in the mountains.
He moves along the railroad tracks because there are towns and villages...
...where he can get food easily.
Poor thing, he'll be hunted down and killed in the end, won't he?
No, he must not be killed!
- But...
- We must appeal...
...to the scientific world and to the public and save him.
When he reaches a place that satisfies him...
...we must give him food, so that he will settle there.
I believe he will stop next at some place half-way up Mt. Fuji.
SHIRANE HUTS
Let's dance.
Yes.
What's the matter?
Did you hear anythingjust now?
No.
Don't worry. Don't worry.
This is terrible.
Why is it that there's no one around not even the employees working here?
We can only think that
Frankenstein became violent again.
Please.
Thanks.
Are you still of the opinion that
Frankenstein must be protected and kept alive'?
We are not certain yet whether he caused all that destruction or not.
- You don't think he did it?
- No.
Judging from his former movements,
Mt. Shirane is too far away for him.
He was seen to the north of Shizuoka last, so...
...if he's been moving he would be somewhere near the foothills of Mt. Fuji now.
He hasn't harmed anyone of his own accord even once.
- Are you of the same opinion, Doctor?
- Yes, I am.
N0 one has seen
Frankenstein at Mt. Shirane.
Everyone that saw him was killed.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
It's hard to make them believe us, isn't it?
I wonder.
A cave-in!
This is terrible!
Shimamoto!
- Mr. Kaneshima!
- Miyaguchi!
Let's
Are you all right?
- Done for.
- What?
Let's go in.
Wait. It's dangerous if it's filled with poisonous gasses.
Oh! What's that?
It's moving!
It's moving!
It's an animal!
The food that we threw down yesterday hasn't been touched.
It wasn't him at the
Shimizu tunnel, was it?
Frankenstein doesn't eat people.
I know he's around here somewhere.
Our home's smashed to pieces!
Mother!
Daddy!
Mommy said she'd be at the south quarry today.
Yes.
Mother!
Daddy!
Advance!
This place was used as a powder magazine during the war.
It's over a mile long in there.
We'd like to go in too.
Well, if you do, please be very careful.
Yes.
Standing by!
All right!
We're all ready, sir!
All right!
There he is! Fire!
Did they find him?
Fire!
Stop firing!
It will only make him angry!
Go back! Go back!
Get back!
Stop it! Get back!
Retreat! Retreat!
- Get back!
- Hurry!
Hurry, Sueko! Hurry!
Hurry! Run!
Help!
Cease firing!
It was Frankenstein after all, wasn't it, at Shimizu tunnel?
So it seems.
We can't possibly keep him alive now.
No...
Shall we leave the rest to the authorities and leave?
I wish we could have a finger of his.
Yes?
- Why, Mr. Kawai.
- It's been a while.
Please come in.
Excuse me.
I saw the papers and came.
- All the way from Akita?
- Yes.
Please sit down.
Thank you for coming.
There's something
I would like to tell you.
I believe there's another monster beside
Frankenstein that's doing all that harm.
WhY d0 you say that?
These newspaper clippings of the Shimizu tunnel...
...and village cases mention that a strange light went on and off.
Which part of Frankenstein's body glows like that? His eyes?
No, they don't glow.
Then what is it that glows?
There's a reason for my believing it to be different from Frankenstein.
During the earthquake in Akita, I saw a mysterious light that went on and off.
It happened during the blackout.
I think the light came from a very low position.
I told myself that the violent earthquake...
...had upset me so much that it had made me imagine things.
Frankenstein walks on land, so how could he travel...
...from Shirane to Mt. Fuji without being seen by a single person?
However, this monster can travel underground.
Doctor!
Frankenstein must not be killed!
Would you tell your story to all the newspapers?
Yes.
It burrows underground, so it dislikes the rays of the sun.
It did appear in the daytime at a quarry in Shizuoka...
...but that was probably due to the thick fog.
- Like a ninja, huh'?
- What?
It's nothing.
If we only had a picture of the monster or something, we could write it up.
But I'm afraid just your words haven't enough news value.
Some deep-sea fish are bioluminescent.
Yes.
This monster lives underground all year round, so...
It wouldn't be strange if it is bioluminescent.
However, when it comes to burrowing itself beneath the ground...
...it is so huge that it's quite a difficult thing to do.
The way I look at it is like this...
In the Mesozoic Age, mammoth reptiles vanished from the earth...
...because the earth's surface cooled off. Am I correct?
Yes.
Some of them escaped to the deep underground and may have...
...continued to multiply and lived until today.
I won't say it is impossible to happen...
...but I can't agree with you either...
...since such a thing is highly improbable.
No one would believe my story.
They all treated me like a mad man.
We're very grateful to you.
Thank you for coming all this way.
N0, yours is the hard work.
I hope you find Frankenstein very soon and save him.
- Please.
- Thanks.
The best of luck.
Good bye.
When I have enough time and money, I'll come again.
Good bye.
I'm afraid we're running out of time and money too.
Did the hospital in Hiroshima send word'?
They said to drop this futile search and return to work.
We can't depend on the scientific world to help us any more either.
How about money'?
The hotel will wait for payment, but...
...it costs so much to hire the helicopter every day.
Come on...
Yesterday's food is all gone!
Throw more down in the same place!
0K3)'-
Circle the place once more!
Do you think he remembers me'?
- I'm not sure.
- We can't decide anything now.
The thing is to find and take care of him somehow.
Boy!
This way.
My compass doesn't work.
Let's go on anyway.
Yes.
The weather has become very bad.
It's impossible to find him, isn't it?
Yes.
It's not safe. Let's come again.
Please go ahead.
Dr. Kawaji!
- I'm quite safe alone.
- N0, Dr. Kawaji!
Dr. Bowen!
Even if Frankenstein remembers
Dr. Togami, we don't know...
...if she can tame him now.
I agree with the public opinion that says to kill him!
But all our hard work up to now would g0 to waste if he were shot to pieces.
I'd like his heart intact, and some of his flesh too.
It would be easier for us to take care of it.
But you can't do it alone!
I think he is most vulnerable...
...here, his eyes.
I brought something to blind him.
If he's blind, he will be in my hands.
That's crueler than killing him outright!
He's doomed to be killed anyway.
If we can keep his heart intact...
...it's the only way to save
Frankenstein's life, don't you see?
I don't know how you intend to do it, but if you fail...
...and anger him, it will be very dangerous.
We'll never be able to get near him again.
I can't fail.
Stay back!
The underground monster!
Hurry! Run!
Sueko!
Sueko!
Sueko!
Sueko!
Sueko!
Dr. Bowen!
Dr. Togami!
Dr. Bowen!
Dr. Togami!
Frankenstein!
Dr. Kawaji!
Dr. Kawaji! Dr. Kawaji!
Are you all right?
Hurry!
Watch where you go...
Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry! Hurry!
- Is there a first aid kit?
- Yes.
- Baragon's about 2 miles from here.
- ls that true?
Head for the hills! Head for the hills!
Head for the hills!
Head for the hills! Hurry!
Watch your feet!
Watch where you walk.
- Are you all right now'?
- Yes.
That monster dives underground so fast.
Frankenstein's no match for him.
As Mr. Kawai said, the oil fields, hot springs and volcanoes...
...may have something to do with underground passages.
The deepest place under the earth... we don't know so many things about it.
The forest is burning!
You're all safe?
Yes, there's another monster beside Frankenstein!
What?
- Are all the men in their positions?
- Yes, sir!
- Report the current status!
- Yes, sir!
What's that?
That's a giant octopus!
- Isn't the main force here yet?
- Orderly, step out!
Move Platoon 5!
Yes, sir!
- Move Platoon 1 to Area A!
- Yes, sir!
He'll lose! He can't win!
That octopus!
Did Frankenstein die?
N0, Frankenstein will never die.
I think he'll return again somewhere, sometime.
Perhaps, the best thing would be for him to die. After all, he's only a monster.
All platoons clear out!
Clear out!
Clear out!
Clear out!
THE END
A TIME OF ROSES
Do you believe you could interpret the face of your neighbor?
Even if you touch the skin you'll feel wrinkles, muscles...
They are twisting the facts.
- True, it is a political question
Historical research, science in general, pastime - perquisites, everything has been put to serve one single purpose
The thing which may seem unbreakable, is often a great lie
A small part which may seem very important - may be completely insignificant in relation to the wholeness
We often think, that...
We know nothing about her yet.
Not even Raimo.
She died in 1976 -
Eight years before you were born
So this fracture is thought to be older, - caused before the fall from the train
As you know, we can't reveal this information to the public
Of course not
The case is old, there's no need to cause - fear and panic in the society
Of course we will take the 08-group's opinion into consideration
Just like everybody elses
Without forgetting the responsibility for the entirety
Are you still worrying about it?
Rumors are different than the official opinion
Rumors...
She experienced a typical
Finnish hero's death; - fell drunk from the train, - in the middle of the night, wearing stripe pyjamas
"This is the last battle - we shall join the front line..."
Only a few were able to realize the actual state of the things
For instance the attitude towards the thoughts of Karl Marx - who lived in the 19th century, was strongly emotional
One and another were swearing allegiance to his name, - while others were cursing
We can ignore this whole mess of thoughts as a joke, - of which history offers numerous examples
The 1960's and 70's meant - the strong rise of politicizing
This was seen in the Western World - as a tremendous increase of socialistic ideals
During that period -
Europe saw the most violent protests of the century
The civil war was about to break out in America
Maybe as a result of this, radical right-wing groups were formed - both in Europe and America
All these different political groups said to be - more democratic than others
Therefore the whole unsettled period was named -
''The Decades of Democracy''
While the rest of the world was going through a difficult crisis, - people in Finland, among the few privileged countries, - lived off the fat of the land
In the late 1970's the developing countries suffered from, as they called it, -
"The Great Hunger Years", which lasted about 15 years
The politicians in power - handled the situation poorly
The hunger-driven troops in
Africa, Asia and  -
South America, tried to reach the Nordic welfare states
We can be amazed, - that the situation didn't lead to global war
The wars were limited to local conflicts...
The whole period of time with diseases and migrations - was a peculiar mixture of new and fear-ridden Middle Ages
Even in many industrially developed countries, large scale disorder broke out from period to period
Some people came up with the conclusion that - a foreign war was the only way to unite the nation
Berlin crisis in 1982, - which began in East Germany - and the conflict between China and USSR a year later - brought the world dangerously close to total war
The Cuban crisis, which people were horrified at exactly 50 years ago, was - according to the researches, a point of departure - to the assassination of president
John F. Kennedy, - was a children's game compared...
- That is not correctly presented
The actual wars and killings were focused on poor countries
It was clear that these kind of immature political crises - had to be stopped, and focus on - removing world hunger
The disagreements between socialist and capitalist countries - started to ease off. Freedom and humanity... - Bullshit!
Not freedom but a new kind of spiritual oppression
As a result of the development, the society reached - its present formal state.
We can be proud of it!
Regressive politics have been put aside - from the way of righteous, knowledgeable scientists
The old class division is gone - due to the increase in social maturity
Violence has been replaced with liberalism
Liberalism creates comfort, - safety and freedom
In other words the power is used by the experts, - so-called unbiased officials, who are so distant - from the people that it stinks!
There is your freedom!
Panu already let himself be fooled by Raimo, - something I understand well
I personally have nothing against Raimo
And there's nothing crooked or base in our methods, - you can rest assured of that
Has the information arrived yet?
- It's been promised for today
But what is it? - All they had.
She was no celebrity
You know I want a modest, ordinary person
As we expose Raimo, - we'll expose the whole
Historical Institute
Nothing like in that...
What was it now?
History of the Kennedys.
- Two years ago
Your memory is excellent, darling
It was a wonderful show. - I guess so
It's in the practical level - where things are truly revealed, like in perks
But it's easy to mislead there, too
What happens with you is the same thing that happens with us, - and happened last week in Argentina
Raimo is just one of many, but we must begin somewhere
Yes?
- It's Pepe Lahtinen
Could you come to my room?
I've got the statistics for your special exhibition - it just came
Oh good. I'll come right away
There it is
Everything goes through here
And what am I, a computer?
- I know
She's there again
Start videotaping!
Howdy! - At last!
Here's all we had in our archives
Born in Kuopion
Maalaiskunta in 1946
Whoah, she'd be...
Yeah, father. Baptized!
Funny, baptized!
Saara Maija Katriina.
Moved to Helsinki in 1965
Married in 1968, to Matias Turunen.
A divorce...
Worked at a dru... What? as a saleswoman in a drugstore additional income as a model
Pretty ordinary
What would you like to eat?
Died getting hit by a car in a movie shoot in May 1976
Got something good?
Calories 30, 25, 100...
- Two of those!
This? - Exactly
You won't regret it. - Thank you
As a 16-year-old won a competition organized by a women's magazine - and got to visit Helsinki for a few days
She got to meet celebrities, - visit a theatre and the premiere of some movie
Hey! "Now I know what it is to be close to celebrities!"
"Will you return some day?
- I sure will!"
This is exactly what you are looking for
How'd your wife recover from the mess?
Don't get your hopes high yet
Here you have a brilliant possibility - to frame a new, helpless victim of history
And to jerk some tears
Come on now
We don't KNOW anything yet
We stick to the facts
Go on, answer it.
It must be the Central Archive
Central Archive. Additional information on Saara Turunen
Connecting to the search unit
I'm sorry, all fingerprints from
1973 are faded
Wrong humidity in some old office
Do you need the photographs?
- Photos, everything
Today, for us - progress is - the augmentation of achievements
For them progress was questionable and uncertain
Give it to me!
Overpopulation, - novel weapons of total destruction, - looming famine - meant for a person like Saara Turunen - a threat mixed with fear
Where does this last image come from?
What's the origin of the last image?
- News-photo archive
She's appeared in newspapers later.
I wonder what's the reason
Politicians dictated the direction progress was to take
But what did the ordinary citizen feel and experience?
What was the good of society and where did the good of individual stop?
It might not be so easy for us today - to comprehend the problems of an ordinary person like that, - for who among us is ordinary these days?
Class distinctions have been eradicated, everyone - participates in the society according to their nature
This prosperous societal field - doesn't exclude anyone anymore
That's why we have also gotten rid of fear
Did Saara live here long?
She was here for at least two summers
I don't remember those days so well, -
I was so young
Saara must've only seen a little girl in me
She had recently divorced when she moved here
I think she forgot to take those pearls with her
Was Saara like a part of the family?
She was a golden girl
She died in a traffic accident in 1976
Two years before my mother
My mother liked her so
Did you meet her anymore?
Once she came here and gave me this
A personal gift
She was always friendly to us young ones, as well
I don't believe in the stories they wrote about her
What stories do you mean?
All kinds of bad ones
She didn't live here, anymore
A beautiful song
Sure it's beautiful
Every time I listen to it I imagine Saara's singing to it
Though it's just instruments
Of course, my dear friend.
I have already begun to take action
Good! No rush
Our form of life is not in any danger yet, - but they seem to be up to something
Bye. - All right, always yours
You know about those labour issues from last century
We are in urgent need of a statement - about the obsoleteness of strikes
Strike?
Yes?
I was just asking about seeing the papers on - the Sariola case.
Just privately, you know
You may ask Raimo.
How come?
Isn't Raimo there?
I'm talking about the issue.
Excuse me, I'm a bit busy
Of course. - Strange
A public figure is often a myth
Would you like to read this book?
- How did you get in?
The cleaner. - You appear to be in good terms
Look
Did you buy her tender memories - off that old hag?
Saara used to sell these as a sales representative, - and gave them away to her acquaintances as personal gifts
What you are talkative today.
- I'm always talkative
By the way, now I know
Saara's scandal -
She asked many men simultaneously for abort money
A good idea in itself
What should her hair look like?
What are you driving at?
I just wondered what this girl is like
Who?
I saw her at the exhibition a few days ago
She looks like Saara Turunen
How should I know.
- Apparently a waitress
Central Archive
Could you look up a person who looks approximately like this?
About so, yes... thank you
What are you going to do to her?
Possibly they could be identical, - if they had lived in similar conditions
See, we could create - a portrait of a past person using a live model
Brilliant!
A dangerous crossing... three hundred...
You guessed right
Raimo wants to go fetch
Kisse from Kuortane
That's good! They might get to know each other more closely
He wants to see Kisse's living conditions

Excuse me, I wanted to meet - an engineer named
Kisse Haavisto
She's here, but she's on a break, playing
Can I go there?
- Of course!
They just get excited if someone goes to look at it
Excuse me, may I have...
Do you recognize this picture?
Listen Kisse, your backhold almost broke me
I was told, that...
Good, Kisse! Now you can push it from the pelvis. That is important
All right, grab her!
Not like that!
Grab that, put your hand there.
Deeper, deeper
Good! Lift!
You've got talent for this!
Wait here
Was it the picture...
- What?
Was it the picture that caught your interest or..? - What?
Few are interested in information, you know. - What?
Information! - I have a learning machine home
I mean, it's rare that anyone is so interested that - they'd visit an exhibition more than once
Information is actually exactly what we... manufacture
That's our product
Hold on, Kisse
I'll be ready in a second
Listen, I think you could...
But you don't even know me
You are a free person, aren't you? and only a free person can pose as an oppressed one
This Saara Turunen was socially afloat, - like the weakest people still are. A victim
Me a victim?
You might find her interesting to get to know
She had this raw power, - like a small vampire yet very pathetic
I'm not like that!
That's exactly why!
She was supposed to save a child from getting hit by a car
After shooting the scene she put the child down and - straightaway got hit by a car coming from the opposite direction
Horrible! - Isn't it?
I'm sure you'd be good
In getting hit by a car?
Hi!
I can't hear you!
A strike?
Come here!
A strike? I wonder if they've thought it through?
Who do you mean? These technicians of yours or whatever they are
Or is it just mass restlessness?
I've heard it comes up - after abusing mood enhancement pills, - but it's very easy to cure
I don't know - if it's so easy to cure in this case
If the deputy manager of the technical department and the main economist - want to keep stalling perfectly clear reforms
And you can't even talk to them, of course they must be fired
I'll say it straight:
They are complete retards
Surely. Incompetence must be opposed always and everywhere
It's not really so
Some people don't want to believe that others want to live, too
And money isn't the only reason
Well said
There's many sides to life and many sides to every human being
You're coming, right?
- We'll see
Is it your child? - Yes
Is she kind?
- Ask her!
Of course children are kind
No, not even close!
- But you knew Saara back then
How can you know that?
I can barely remember myself
I spent many years abroad when she died
I was married
I have been happily married for 53 years now
You were talking about some films?
Yes, she liked filming and
I filmed her a little
Here you have a couple of them, but it's confidential
Since you are investigating her.
- Of course, of course
That old weirdo
We could still blackmail her with this material, - if we wanted.
- Can you still use these?
Of course you can
Truth comes first
There is also the point, - that I helped Saara financially in the beginning
She was a good girl, it was a pleasure to help her
We spent a nice time together
She wasn't the kind of person you were thinking of
It is not just a question of financial matters
Go and talk your shit to the other people, - why are you always harassing me?
Hey hey, take it easy.
Listen, I am warning you
I know rats from the smell
Let me smell you
Hell, I am smelling you!
Everybody was here last evening
Is that so
Are you on the picture?
No, it is dad.
What if i would go a bit...
- Okay!
If you have seen one, you have seen them all
Do you remember her well?
Of course. Every model is special for me.
I remember Saara specially well
I was the one who found her
Later she learned how to move - and started to strip
Really?
A profession like any other
It wasn't easy at that time
If Miss would come in the picture
But we just came here to ask a little
Everybody is worth a photo, when you know how to do it right
That Saara had puffy breasts
There you go and...
There
Saara had exactly same positions
I was the one who took her first nude shots
Do you mean full nude?
Of course, of course! Art photos -
Not too virgin like, but beautiful
Beautiful
There. There you go!
There
She was forced to continue
Otherwise her husband would have known
Little titties
Good
Okay, that's enough!
Does this Kisse remind you of any of your models?
No. Why?
That's it.
Thank you for your help
Good day! I hope we're not distracting you too much
Even though it's a beautiful day
Very, very. Did you bring my films with you?
I haven't had the chance to look at them yet
Remember to return them
Oh, my god
You are like two berries, if you keep your hair that way
That's true, beautiful
(Old man:) So young.
Saara was the type of girl, - she was like youth itself, - so natural and real
I could have helped her when she was dying, - if I hadn't been abroad
Why did you go abroad in the first place?
It was my work
Foreign trade was already being conducted back then
And your wife was there?
- True
Maybe it was for the better that she got out
We met each other in the summer, -
It was the late sixties
The war raged in Vietnam back then
I'm sorry...
Wrong room
She played in a total of five movies which add up to 127 seconds
That's a biography in itself
In other words this is what she made her living out of
Not really. She was a saleswoman in a boutique
She got additional income through stuff like this
I think she was an ordinary, natural girl
I think she liked working in sales
She lacked the talent to do anything else
Have you already measured her IQ?
Yes. She had had to career counseling
Liar!
Here, have a look
She lacked education, not intelligence
What do you think, Kisse?
- I can't say anything yet
I think you're forcing an exception out of Saara, - instead of an ordinary person
Oh well, even an exception can be a reflection of her time
What exceptional things are you going to reveal about me?
It's important to keep all possibilities open in this profession
People are different and sometimes surprising
What if it was a suicide?
She had problems, a scandal
Or it was fear of losing her role
She had nothing but her paltry looks
You look like her, but prettier
Yes? - It's Anu. Do you remember what kind of clothes - the saleswomen at a drugstore wore?
- No
Waterdrops dry up - from round lotus flowers
Silent, lonely, no people in sight - during the third moment of the night
A leaf drops tinkling, -
I wake up, the dark cloud of my dream scatters
The night is boundless
I can't find my way to the dreamland
When morning, I walk around - the garden paths
In the horizon - the tired wayfarer stops - in the mountains one more time - and looks at the old garden - reminiscences in his heart, - the swallow tower is empty, - where is the beauty queen?
Swallows, you make your nests in vain - behind locks
The past and present are like a dream, - that we don't wake up from
We stare at the past, - we mourn the future - and compare them
The yellow tower is shining in the night - and I - sigh in the night
You'll be a magnificent Saara
Slower, slower
Savour the details
Let the clothes caress your skin
It makes the spectators move
Imagine them licking you all over with their looks
And enjoy it
That's it!
Good, good. This has the colour of the times
Beautiful, brilliant!
Damn good thing
Good. Just like that!
Beautiful
Wonderful, do it again
Remember you're wanted
It's about the institution of nudity
Be more base
Right, good!
Then the next photo!
If you had lived in the 19th century, - there would be at most a painting left of you
Instead there exist newspaper stories and films about Saara Turunen and a vast amount of archival data
Even more will be left of us
But how do you think it'll benefit a researcher?
Do you mean that it's difficult to distinguish - between true and false information?
It's even more difficult to interpret a large amount of information than small
Helping people see is the most important thing to me
How come?
You have exactly the same eyes. Darling
Howdy! Are you alone? - Yes
Of course
I've got a lot of work to do right now
You are a true conservative
Work and personal income are your whole life
Why can't you just live and be?
- I think I've lived enough
And besides, I really have to work now
How's it going with Kisse?
You're funny
Can't you see the state you're in?
Yes
You're always like that when you're in love. Can't you remember?
Well, gimme a kiss
No, like this
And remember, if you have the courage to sleep with Kisse, - she's from this century, kiss kiss
She has plenty of potential for development
I think she could learn to do more individual work
Are you tired of her?
That has no effect
I just think that Anu Huotari is ready to move on
There hasn't been a single mention of the strike on TV
Can't you tell Raimo about it?
Sure, but we mustn't hurry.
- Who cares about that?
Raimo is a typical elite official, - and these things don't matter to them
We talked among the boys today
When the strike is over - we'll get that international room tropic to the hall
Can I get Kuortane 1788?
Kuortane 1 788? - Yes
Yes? - Raimo Lappalainen from the Historical Institute, good day
Are the strikers still as stubborn?
First lane, turning right forbidden
Have you heard there's a strike at a factory?
Who'd be crazy enough to go on a strike?
They don't exist nowadays
There would've been a mention on light channel or somewhere
Sorry for bothering you so late with this insurance business
Hello, here's rep...
- Fuck!
Where have you been?
- Kissing
It's good that you have healthy hobbies
Please tell me, cofidentially, - how many were there?
So you don't want to answer? What do you reckon the viewers are thinking?
Our sympathies are with you
Straighten out the misunderstandings, don't leave room for mean rumours
How did this series of events begin?
In the end it's a question of destroying a life
Dear viewers, you can't accept just anything from the development of the '70s. Our board of experts, - where the greatest talents from the church, psychology, sociology - and the home protection union are represented, confirms this
Horrible. Poor thing
She doesn't seem to be in control of the situation
She's been picked on so much she's finished
She's done it herself
Are you certain?
- Of course
By acting vulgarly and giving rise to a scandal
Although she can be understood
She was practically looking for her end
What did she have left but lies and creeping old age
So death was the correct solution?
In a way
Do you mean that everyone, - whose life isn't real, should die?
The lowest branches of a tree will always be in shade
They'll wither and fall off
Of course I'm sorry
It's a pity to leave just as things are beginning to happen
Can't it be organized in some way?
The manager said
I'm needed in other duties
I'll have to take a training period and so on
Congratulations!
We'll manage.
And Kisse is a big help
Move on, darling, and keep your head up!
And we'll stay friends, right?
Let's go out sometime and march all over the town
Where did you say you were from?
- The Historical Institute
Oh
Have you collected them yourself?
Are you from there too?
- She's my secretary
I've collected them myself, who else
Nothing is as unselfish as owning books
As I already said on the phone, - we're not looking for a scandal
Could be. I don't know
I understand you've had your disappointments
The scandal caused by Saara - must have been a hard blow to you
I was already divorced, remember that!
I was able to get rid of - such a lowly creature in due time
But it didn't stop her from causing me shame - even after our divorce
She even damaged my position in the library
I was naturally outside it all, - but you know how dirty people's imaginations can be
You're sitting on her favourite chair, miss
So she lived here? - No
I moved here when we divorced
You didn't remarry?
Collecting like this must be a lot of work
After you lose your eyesight, only smelling remains
Why don't you try how her face feels like?
Why don't you videotape them?
Why don't you videotape them?
- Say what?
Why don't you videotape the interviews?
Because I think he's an old idiot
I said, why don't you record the interviews?
Wouldn't it be more real?
Think so? I think it'd only disarrange Saara's image
One must stick to the essentials.
Besides, I can't - concentrate on anything but you
Let's dance
I don't know how to, but you can teach me
It'd be beautiful...
It'd be beautiful to trip on your legs. - You're crazy
It isn't easy to influence him
I know that
He thinks he's acting sincerely
He is acting sincerely and that's just the danger
Raimo has been presenting the results of his research
They reveal clearly that almost everybody only watches - the Light Channel programme.
- That's correct
And channel four is truly free
Anyone can present their opinions there, - but nobody is watching
We don't know how people could be made to understand
If they get to choose, they'll take the easy way
No problems, no suffering
It's so damn clever.
There's a multitude of choices, - but only one is designed to succeed
It's like we have a switch on our heads.
We let ourselves be deceived
Censorship is attached to men's own heads full of piss
A couple more years and we get people moving
We must start today
Just don't do anything inconsiderate
Turn on the Light Channel at eight o'clock this evening and you'll see
What do you think about the future?
How come?
- What's it like?
Our future?
- Or generally
I don't know.
- You should know
What are you doing?
- My work, some calculations
My head hurts.
- Take a pill
I hate pills
I don't think much can be said about the future
Whatever the precision of predictions - or the scientific basis of fantasies, - the personal qualities of a researcher are always the deciding factor
If he's optimistic, he sees a bright future, - if he's pessimistic, it's gloomy
Are you sure?
Can't personal influence be accounted for?
I'm afraid not
What do you do with the research, then?
Different people do different things
The situation is such that during the last 40 years, - especially in the late 20th century, - more than 27000 affluent people have been preserved to wait for better times
How has this preservation been done, professor Häme?
Their body temperature has been reduced to halt - biochemical activity.
Thus rotting has been eliminated
The body has been emptied of blood and the veins have been filled with a preservative
Does it seem likely that they could be woken up?
It might be possible in the future
Maybe already in a hundred years.
But we aren't sure - if the preservation method has been good
But I'd say there's hope
Even if the rejuvenation succeeds, - could complications arise?
- Oh yes
The biggest problem for these people will be fitting in
Just imagine waking up in a hundred years
These people might not get on well in a strange world
Adjustment might come about by being given - familiar items or clothes
What if they are seized by a deep depression anyway?
It might already be possible to move - a person's intelligence to bionic data units
I'm afraid that the scientists of the future - would seize the cerebral activity of the most intelligent ones - and would let the resurrected die again
I'm afraid that - that the season of peace and impartiality can't continue
Dear friends!
I represent the strike council of Kuortane nuclear plant
This is a peaceful, nonviolent demonstration
You may not have heard about our strike
But we want everybody to know
The power must be removed from executive organs - and experts feigning impartiality
We invite everybody to join in the decision-making
Making decisions that concern us all
Step by step we'll expand our strike
And all power plants shall join it
And if one night lights go out at your neighbour's, or your home, or the whole town or the electricity is totally cut, you must know that - behind this issue is a battle organization - that thinks about you
We demand that officials responsible for decisions - join in reciprocal discourse with us, and we will - continuously inform you about the situation on channel four
We will advance peacefully according to plans, - without violence. We maintain the pressure with our work, - our numbers and our existence
Dear viewers, you've only been shown shadows
You've only been given weeds
And yet... the world is rich!
There'll be plenty of roses for all andand...
No, no!
Who could be behind something like that?
You can't trust anything anymore
Any amateur can come to the programme - and start talking about progress
Like we all weren't doing everything we can for it
Can't you..? - Shut up!
If they knew what the situation really is - they surely wouldn't crave for power
Dear viewers, you've only been shown shadows
You've only been given weeds
And yet... the world is rich!
There'll be plenty of roses for all andand...
Didn't you see it?
They shot him!
Shot him!
So what? How many do you think will be shot, if people - are allowed to roam and rave - knowing nothing about anything?
You and your kind are preventing - people from knowing anything
What do you want to know?
Tell me, what are you people so eager to know?
You are being fed - and for that you may remain silent
Of course! But think why!
Coward. Coward. Coward
I'm above all an official, - it's among my responsibilities to support the impartiality - that is necessary for our progress
I think Olli is right
What?
We have a responsibility
Besides, I'm not so sure about Raimo
In what way?
- That he's evil
If we want possibilities for people and ourselves, - they must be given to his kind, too
Has he already messed up your mind?
On the contrary. When the show is ready, I'll reveal our plan - to him and he can choose
Hell no!
Don't be so sure about Raimo, Kisse
You don't know him yet
That's why
I don't want to decide anything about a man I don't know
These are for you? - What now?
Are you going to betray me?
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I was shocked
Of course.
I'm sorry as well, darling
I didn't remember you were old friends
Honey. - Darling
There's the last photos of Saara on that wall
Five minutes before her death
It's as if she already knew.
- Isn't it
I absolutely want a better death - on this show than getting hit by a car
Something more dramatic
We'll switch the car for a train, like this
It runs along tracks undeniably like death
Saara is waiting on the tracks, runs, and saves a child, - just like in reality. Good
Then she dodges, puts the child down - and move away.
Remains standing
But at the same moment a train comes from the opposite direction
Saara doesn't notice.
She's being warned
She can't hear or doesn't she want to hear?
There! The tragedy has reached a conclusion
Oh my God! What will I do?
What do you mean?
Nothing
Nothing
What is it, honey?
- Nothing
Nothing
Like in a dream or an old movie
People's destinies approach each other
A machine that brings people together
What would you say if we got married?
I feel we belong together
You could complement my aspirations - and I could help you
You'd be a dream wife for me
Who am I now? Saara or me?
You want to hurt me. All right.
No
What do you bring Saara into it for?
She's dead
You only have to choose
- Me?
Do you want someone who's alive or someone who's dead?
It's odd
Like work didn't matter
You and your fucking strikes!
I could take your foolishness on the palm of my hand and blow
Truthfully, - my best intention...
If I could give... at least a small droplet - of consolation to people -
I can consider myself successful
Just you try to take this right from me
Are you leaving me now?
No
I'll do my job and all the rest.
- What rest?
Everything that goes along with it
Here, take a walkie-talkie
Do I press the button?
- Yes
Now we'll shoot the train approach
Saara ha saved the child and put in on the ground
The train has just passed
You look forward in relief and fail to notice - that a train is approaching from behind
Can you hear me? - Yes
Jump aside at my command
Can you hear? Listening.
- I can hear you
Jump! Do you hear?
Jump, jump!
Jump, jump, jump!
Jump!
I told you to jump, it'll run over you
Was the camera running?
Time? - 11.40
On Light Channel today at 3.30pm -
"Entertainment for millions"
At 4.10 - A depiction of a person who lived 50 years ago, - based on documentary material by Raimo Lappalainen
You ask about the researcher's part. It's always secondary
Especially in a show like this, - telling about an individual in the past perhaps an unimportant character, - who, through research - is raised to an image of her time
The researcher is impartial, humble, neutral
In a sense you could say he doesn't exist
The face of the past a show with the lightness and beauty of a folk song
Yes, of course.
You are right, - but it's better to fix it - than leave it as it is
Ambiguousness is like sugar to an ant, - it attracts rabble like nothing
See what I mean, eh?
I'm serious!
Do you think I'm playing fucking games, what?
There's reason to avoid attachment, anyway attachment, to what?
The thing is, - is someone doesn't understand, - they just don't understand
Take care, or I'll have to handle the issue some other way
Do you fucking understand?
In a minute we'll begin the show based on -
Raimo Lappalainen's documentary material, -
The face of the past, - a depiction of a person - from a half century ago
Consistency is no god
There are different grades to it
First you must determine the task, - and the task creates the laws of consistency
And what comes to honesty, - it's always relative
Relative to work and the task
Saara Turunen died in 1976
She was a relatively unknown person, - ordinary and modest
She lived a short and fervent life
Our compassion lies with her like with every individual, - large and small, under any circumstances
In those times time was measured by the beginnings and ends of wars
Violence was included in all important decision-making, - at least in the background
In spite of the repugnance of violence, - we can understand it, - for in those times most people were wandering around - without awareness of themselves and their place in society
Saara Turunen was one of them
They were societal dynamite - full of extreme pressures, the controlling of which - was beyond the capabilities of the politicians of the time
It wasn't until our free society that - these pressures have found individual and humane ways of dissolving
Little Saara, as we can now say you are trying to reach the form of life - that has today become - consistent, secure, everyone's own
What is it?
Democracy.
A humane, liberal form of life -
That has to be protected from conflicts like a blossom
Well said
...as the melody of tomorrow plays the hour strikes, and night recedes and the people and work are in glory
Oh, so many have fallen tired on the roadside
Oh, so many have died in battle but earthly might shall not dishearten us we'll create a strong peace to drive quarrels away join us in brotherhood, peoples from every nation then even the roses will start to bloom on the road of our happiness
Need, misery, everything will be left behind so, the poor people of happiness,
I'll lift my head up high!
The time is now 10:41,
19 minutes before countdown.
19 minutes.
- Yes? Yeah.
- Jeannie?
This is Pete. See if you can find someone to take a story for me.
My typewriter's seized up.
- I'll try.
- You all right?
Yeah, so far.
You better come up here, Jeannie.
No sense of being on your own.
Pete, how long before we know...
- Copy desk? Hold, I'm giving you newsroom.
- Yes?
- Look, Kitty, do me a favour.
- Are you ready?
- Who's there?
- Pete Stenning. I can't write.
Now, will you take it for me?
But for what? Who says there's gonna be an edition?
Just take it.
Okay Go ahead. Nice and slow.
It is exactly 30 minutes since the corrective bombs were detonated.
Within the next few hours, the world will know whether this is the end or another beginning.
The rebirth of man or his final obituary.
For the last time, man pursued his brother with a sword, and so the final fire was kindled.
The Earth that was to live forever was blasted by a great wind towards oblivion.
It is strange to think that barely 90 days ago...
Davis. Yeah?
When did it collapse? Anyone in it?
Try and get a local photographer.
I'll send someone.
Mitchell!
- Yes, Dave?
- More flood trouble.
Ascot Racecourse, new grandstand collapsed.
About the only thing not underwater in that area seems to be Windsor Castle.
- Martin's down there. Take a photographer.
- Right.
I think Foreign gets the splash tonight, Dave.
Big earthquake piece from Jakarta.
We got enough splashes with these floods.
"Exeter marooned. Five to six feet of water, main Devon roads.
"Marines move in with high troop carriers."
I'll even take earthquakes.
Steve, try and get a call through to Plymouth.
Tell Denison to give us the latest Lynmouth position.
"Add flash. Beauty queen riot.
Contestants sue each other."
Yeah, we got some great pictures, but Jeff says we're a family newspaper.
Down here, Mr Davis.
- Anything new on the test?
- Only the last AP report, sir.
New York announces it was detonated
25 miles from the South Pole.
- Must be the biggest bang yet.
- Not that test. The cricket.
Oh. Sorry, sir. Still no play.
Six inches under...
- Were you getting tea?
- I wasn't, Mr Davis...
- Well, you are now.
- Anything else exciting?
Yeah, four transatlantic jets grounded with reported navigation trouble.
- What causes navigation trouble?
- Sunspots.
- Sunspots?
- Well, ask a silly question...
Right here, Mr Maguire.
More protest letters, sir.
- No. Take 'em to Features.
- Features said take them to you, sir.
I can't stop the bloody bomb.
It went off 10 days ago!
All right. Put 'em down.
Take those back to the morgue, will you?
- Sir.
- Yeah?
No, this is Bill Maguire here.
Oh, I'm sorry, Sandy. He's out of the office at the moment.
Well, yes, even reporters have to go sometime.
Yes, all right. I'll tell him.
Would you mind telling me something?
I was under the impression that you wanted a piece on thrombosis.
Well, as I can only do one thing at a time, what am I expected to do with all these protest letters?
Thank you very much but there's 1,700 of them.
Don't worry about that now. Go down and see if my car's back, will you?
It's a tan Morris in the side entrance.
If it is, Mr Stenning's probably in
Harry's Bar. Tell him he's wanted, quick.
- Sir.
- And how's the thrombosis market?
Great.
This'll give the high-paid executive readers a nice moment of anxiety at their breakfast tomorrow.
Boy!
Mr Sanderson's asking for you, Mr Stenning.
So they sent Pip the cabin boy to bail me out.
- I think he was in a hurry, sir.
- Yes, well, you just tell him I'll be coming up when he sees the bubbles.
I just got to get some clips from the library, sir.
Fine. Make sure my obituary's up-to-date.
But why alter my heading? What is he trying to do, make a job for himself?
Bill, you can't print a feature on thrombosis and call it "You too can be the death of the party."
Aw, we're all getting soft.
That's what we're all getting, soft.
- Hi, Billy boy.
- Good evening.
Well, your car's safely back.
It's a fine vessel and should prove seaworthy for another hundred years or so.
What I don't understand, why bother to come back?
You borrow my car for lunch, why bother to hurry back at 6:30?
- I saw my kid today.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah. Battersea Pleasure Gardens.
She lets me see him sometime.
It's my legal right, you know.
We spent the afternoon on the ghost train, the only customers in the rain.
- You know, Sandy's been screaming for you.
- He's a nice little kid.
Bright, too. Remembered me after about 10 minutes.
You can throw this lot down, too.
My floor's full.
Well, what's it like to have fan mail?
Biggest experimental bang of all time is 10 days old.
Instead of being proud, the public demands we stop it.
Oh, I don't know.
The best science man in the street ought to be able pull off a little job like that.
Make a trick film maybe.
Yeah, you know, the mushroom goes back into the bomb, the bomb goes back into the plane, which flies backwards over the task force steaming backwards from the Antarctic.
Yeah, you better start climbing backwards to Sandy's office.
He wouldn't believe you were in church.
He probably wants me to take over the Science desk.
Promotion. Stenning rises again.
Don't think you wouldn't be welcome.
- What have we got?
- A flash.
"Spitsbergen reports the largest earth tremors ever recorded."
Sorry I wasn't around, Sandy.
Okay, I'm used to it.
- You know anything about sunspots?
- Sunspots?
You hear that static?
My favourite tune. But I don't think it'll make the top 10.
I'm not joking, Pete.
There's usually a lot of sunspot static this time of year, and during the last week it's been heavier than ever.
The TV people are having trouble with their picture.
And so's the public.
- Do me a 500-worder for the leading page.
- Success!
Wait a minute. Here are a couple of items about navigation trouble.
- Maybe you can tie them in.
- Yeah, why not?
Hey, great idea.
With all these floods, what about a Daily Express ark?
Great sales promotion, Sandy.
You know what, Pete? I really think you're gonna have to try a bit harder.
This paper isn't built to carry passengers.
All right?
Okay.
Well, Billy boy, they got me doing your homework.
500 words on sunspots.
Have you seen the figures on some of these earth tremors?
Is another planet trying to contact us?
"Are you receiving me?
Are you receiving me?
"You are? Well, get knotted."
Must've been a hell of a big bang to give these seismograph readings.
Tell me all about sunspots, Daddy.
Sunspots are caused when the rays of the sun beat down on an unprotected torso, thus causing a sun rash similar to acne.
I thought it was clean living that did that.
Ring up the Meteorological Centre.
See if you can speak to Sir John Kelly.
Maybe he'll give you some quotes.
- If not, you can talk to Pat Holroyd.
- Pat Holroyd, that berk from Picture Post?
Oh, he's a PRO now.
He's gone legitimate.
Well, this calls for a celebration toast.
Pete, ring the Met Centre.
I'll be back. It's six and a half minutes past my medicine time.
Get me the Met Centre, please.
- Thanks for holding on, Bill.
- Holding on to what?
My job. This may not be a revelation to you, but, and I quote,
"The thrill is gone,
Bill, it's really gone."
You know what I think?
I should get my finger out and peck on the typewriter.
- Roughly.
- Alcoholics of the press, unite.
Yes?
Oh, yes. This is Peter Stenning,
Daily Express. Sir John Kelly, please.
Well, it's nice of you to be interested.
I want to speak about sunspots.
Just one moment, please.
What do I do with the press?
What does he want you to do?
Wants to talk to
Sir John about sunspots.
Oh, dreary. Press office.
No direct calls to Sir John.
Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm putting you through to the press office.
Look, I don't want the press office, dear. I want Sir John Kelly.
All right, all right.
Then get me Mr Pat Holroyd.
Yeah? Oh yeah, Sandy.
Yes, I understand all that, dear, but Holroyd knows me.
We used to work together.
Now, just tell him Peter Stenning.
No, I'd rather do this myself.
I've got my own sources...
Look, just tell Mr Holroyd!
This girl's a bigger threat than radiation.
I heard that remark. Listen, I don't care if you're Lord Rothermere himself.
All right, Beaverbrook. I'm putting you through to the press office.
You were gonna get me Mr Holroyd.
Would you get me Professor Lambert...
Listen, your job is to pass messages on when you're asked.
My job is to do what I'm told by the people who gave me the job.
And anyway, this isn't my job.
I'm from the pool.
Well, why don't you dive back in and drown?
I take it you didn't get much change out of her.
I'm going over there, and I'm gonna shake her till the tilt sign goes up.
Fine. In the meantime, shake my car keys out of your pocket.
I may want to use it before closing time.
Hello. Professor Lambert?
Hello. It's Bill Maguire here of the Daily Express, Tom.
Hello. Tom, about these seismograph readings of the latest American experiment.
Would you say they were bigger than the official announcement gives out?
Oh, off the record, of course.
Something pretty huge?
- Press office.
- Straight through. Second left.
- Mr Holroyd's on the same floor, isn't he?
- No, sir. One up.
- Did you have an appointment?
- No. I'm just going into the press office.
Hello, Pat. Well, this is a bit better than Picture Post. Isn't it?
Stenning, what the hell do you want?
- A quote on sunspots.
- Sunspots?
Look, just tell me that the static, the monsoon, the compass trouble, and the terrible shows we get on television are all caused by sunspots.
And that the sunspots are caused by bigger bomb experiments and I'll leave you in peace.
Well, there usually is a bit of extra sunspot activity this time of the year, old boy.
But I don't think it has much to do with anything.
But there could be some connection.
Oh, come on, say yes.
What harm could it do you?
Look, Stenning, it's nice to see you again, but I'm afraid I'm up to my neck, old boy.
All right, Miss Johnson.
Take this to the typing pool, have it mimeographed immediately.
- I see you're still a bit of a liberty taker...
- Well, give me something, Pat.
- I've got to get a story out of this.
- Sorry, can't oblige, old boy...
But why not? It's a perfectly routine, harmless, silly season story.
- Look, Peter, you've no right to be here.
- Well, it is, isn't it?
- Well, just tell me, yes or no.
- I don't have to tell you anything, Stenning.
You got no special position that entitles you to a first break on anything that comes into this office.
You mean, something has come in.
- Miss Johnson?
- She's out of the office, Sir John.
- Who's there?
- Holroyd, sir.
- Come in immediately, Holroyd.
- Right, sir.
Now, if you don't mind, Stenning...
I suppose there couldn't be some information that hasn't hit the British public yet.
If there is, you'll get it when everyone else does, in the official release.
Oh, Miss Johnson, perhaps you'd take Mr Stenning down to the press room, would you?
- Of course, sir.
- It's nice to meet an old pal.
- Come this way, please, Mr Stenning.
- Normally, darling, it would be a pleasure, but at the moment, work before women.
The general pattern is pretty clear, but until we get the full picture...
- Yes?
- Sir John.
- I have only one question to ask you.
- Who are you?
I think this gentleman's come to the wrong department.
How are the effects of the recent bomb different from all the others we've managed to survive?
I don't know what your job is, young man, but it's not mine to speculate.
- Come along, Stenning.
- But they are different, aren't they, Sir John?
- You're not making this any easier...
- All right. All right. Relax.
Good try, old man. But these diabolical liberties will get you nowhere.
Oh, come off it. You've gate-crashed for a story often enough.
- Oh, hello. Have you come to fix this?
- Well, I hadn't, but for you, why not?
Oh, I'm sorry.
They said they'd send someone.
Can I help you?
Nearly everyone's gone home.
Yeah, I'd like a copy of tonight's official line release.
- Tonight's what?
- The official release, sweetie.
Oh, those were all a bit smudged.
It's over-inking. I'll get you a clean one.
We're in a terrible state here.
What with summer holidays and flu, we're all doing everyone else's job.
It happens to the best of us.
Success. No smudges.
- This is all I get, sweetie?
- That's all you get.
- Wouldn't like a drink, a meal or a lift home?
- That's correct.
- Just for my record, I'd like your name.
- Peter Stenning.
Just for my record, I'd like yours.
- Peter Stenning?
- Yeah.
- Express?
- Oh, you've heard of me.
Oh, yes. And if you're Peter
Stenning, that's not all you get.
- Oh, great, great.
- You get this, too, sweetie.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to dive back into the pool.
800 grisly words on thrombosis, and look what they do to me.
"Stubborn men and the killer they caught."
What sort of impact heading is that?
I might as well be working on The Police Gazette.
- You're a bit late, aren't you?
- I'm dedicated.
Sounds like a flash, if anyone's interested.
Personally, I'm not. Good night, punchers.
"Russia announce world's largest nuclear test explosion,
"Siberia, last Monday, 8:00 p.m.
"Force of bomb stated exceeds
American by 20%." End flash.
Anything you can do, I can do better.
All right. This is a change-up, next edition.
Monday last, when was that? 23rd?
- Monday. When was the American blast?
- Tuesday.
- What time?
- Late afternoon, wasn't it? I don't know.
- I can check. Messenger!
- Coming.
- Library, clips on test bombs.
- Right.
- No, I want you. Get Mr Maguire back.
- Yes, sir.
What's the difference in time factor between the Antarctic base and Siberia?
- That'd be New Zealand time.
- I pass.
If California's eight hours behind us, they must be more than that down there.
Eighteen, twenty-four...
So evening in Siberia can't be far off the same time as early next afternoon in the Antarctic.
Which makes one hell of a story.
- Now what?
- Better read that.
Yeah, I know. The kid told me...
We'll have a slip edition.
Get Jeff, he's at the Savoy.
Head printer, fast.
Give me a quick 50 words across three columns.
You got five minutes.
I'll write the headline.
Now, let's have something for the leader page.
Possible effects, comparative figures.
Check actual times of explosions.
Five minutes.
- We'll put you in the next edition.
- Thank you very much.
Where the hell's that printer?
Well, get him back from tea.
You, Jock, find me the biggest mushroom picture in the files.
See if there are any stock blocks.
Smudge? Slip edition coming down in five minutes.
Get a bloody move on.
Don't we always? Yes. All right.
Slip edition in five minutes.
Front page needs reset.
What's the betting some princess is pregnant again?
There's a change-up coming down.
Okay, George. Know what it is?
Well, as long as they haven't made beer illegal.
One. Lift.
Slip edition in 10 minutes.
We'll be putting it on four machines.
There's bound to be a big re-plate on the second edition.
Someone up there hates me.
I should've stayed with Woman's Own.
I'll warn them.
Yep, in 10 minutes. Okay.
Henry. Down the chute, quick.
Make sure they've got the mushroom block.
My watch stopped.
Oh, for heaven's sake, Bill, drink or no drink, have I ever missed an edition before?
You missed more than one this time, you missed the slip as well.
What happened?
Where were you last
Tuesday morning at 8:00?
Asleep, if I had any sense.
Then there's something else you missed.
Mankind let off two for the price of one.
That accounts for all that rattling in the Spitsbergen attic.
What's all this amount to?
It amounts to the biggest jolt the
Earth's taken since the ice age started.
Now, if you'd like to swim across to Harry's, I'll buy you a last supper.
- It's stopped raining.
- Has it?
Well, don't tell Jacko, he's liable to stop the presses.
All right. Here you are, 800 words,
"How to be happy, though radiated."
- I suppose thrombosis comes out.
- Sorry we kept you up, Bill.
Oh, it's an honour and a pleasure.
I've always wanted to work an eight-day week.
- And you're listening to a dedicated man.
- Got to lose your sunspots too, Pete.
Come on, Pete, we'll...
- Before we get involved in another flash...
- Jacko.
I had trouble with sunspots, Jacko.
Yeah, I bet you did, but it read fine.
John, where's that bomb data?
Let's have it back a minute.
Thank you.
You coming or not?
You shouldn't have done this, Bill.
I know it. I should've gone home.
I wouldn't have got involved in this.
I need my bloody head examined.
So do you.
I did go to the Met Centre, Bill.
And my watch did stop.
Maybe they'll give you a presentation one when you leave.
I leave tomorrow, you know that.
I don't give a flop what you do, but relieve me of the tension, if you don't mind.
Yes, I know.
What the hell's the matter with you anyway?
Forget it.
No woman's irreplaceable, no matter how much you love her.
I told you, forget it.
There'll be somebody else sooner or later.
London's full of somebody elses.
And that cures everything, doctor?
Does alcohol?
Find yourself a girl, Pete.
Find yourself a dozen.
I've got your permission, have I, Dad?
Permission?
My thoughts will be with you.
Well, well.
The opposition's late tonight.
We don't admit any opposition, son.
Mr Maguire. What will it be?
- Two large lean steaks.
- Not for me. I'll have a Scotch.
You'll have a steak, too. It's good for you to eat at least once a week.
Anything worth reading in tomorrow's paper, Mr Maguire?
It's all agency stuff tonight, so you can have a look for a change.
There is also a well written article on thrombosis.
One cause, eating too much fat.
Oh, I'll tell you this, there's no fat in any of mine.
- Sandy know I wasn't there?
- Just get us a couple of drinks.
- Get on with your orders.
- Oh, May, give it to him.
Don't you take it, Harry.
Who's boss here, you or her?
Knock it off, Mr Cardiff.
I know all about you.
You want jackets with 'em?
No. No potatoes, May.
I've read my article.
What about you, Mr Stenning?
Bill, what did you tell Sandy?
I told him you'd phoned it in.
- Hello, Peter. Still with the Express?
- For the moment.
It's murder up at our place tonight.
They don't know what to make of this Russian bomb.
Your lot never knew what to make of anything.
All right. Nice to have seen you.
Maybe we don't spend enough time in the bars.
Would you like a nice salad?
Salad's very healthy.
Is it? Just some bread, thanks, May.
Fresh for a change.
- Like you?
- Yeah. Sometimes I think I could.
In fact, I'm sure I could.
It's the kid, isn't it?
You want to see the way they're bringing him up, Bill.
It'll be the right the right prep school next.
And then the right boarding school.
And by the time they've finished with him he'll be a right bowler-hatted,
"Who's for tennis", toffee-nosed gent.
But he won't be my son.
Oh, I don't know. That bad blood of yours is bound to come out.
- How old is he now?
- Seven.
That's a nice age. I suppose you're still shelling out for things.
If I wasn't, I wouldn't even try, not that I'm trying too hard.
- Was she there with the kid?
- Oh, no. The nanny brings him.
Yes, they've got a nanny as well.
Nothing but the best is good enough for her husband's wife.
- Well, If they're so well off, why should...
- Because he's my kid, that's why.
Well, here's to him.
May he turn out to be a hard-drinking, hard-fighting son of a bitch.
Yeah, well, that part of his parentage is for sure.
I'll see you tomorrow, Bill.
Oh, don't be long, ducks.
They're ready.
Like a bit of butter, they'll be.
We won't be needing the other steak, May.
Oh, shame.
Shall I wrap it up for your big collie dog, Mr Maguire?
- How's Mrs Maguire?
- Oh, fine, fine. Just fine.
I wouldn't like to be a newspaperman's wife, coming home all hours of the night.
And day. We sometimes come home in the middle of the day.
I bet that could be embarrassing.
Yeah, it has been, for some.
We are not a political party, and we have no intention of becoming one.
We derive our support from individuals of all walks.
The campaign for nuclear disarmament opposes all tests, manufacture, stockpiling, possession or intended use of nuclear weapons.
The world today is imperilled by nuclear anarchy.
Nuclear weapons no longer threaten the enemy, but the whole of mankind.
The fact that we are living in a nuclear age should be a challenge, not a threat.
Instead of building bigger, better and more weapons, we should be concentrating on the tremendous task of feeding the hungry, healing the sick and clothing the naked.
Let us abandon our nuclear weapons...
And may the best man win.
- You all right?
- Yeah, but my camera!
Daily Express. Can I join you?
Why not? We've got
The Herald up here already.
- Always ahead of the Express.
- Yeah, when it comes to getting out of fights.
- Now, don't start another one up here.
- Holy smoke! Look at that!
- It's an eclipse.
- That certainly wasn't in the schedule.
- Lend me this for a minute, will you?
- Hey, what, what are you doing?
I'm press. I want a picture out of this.
What have you got in?
- Black and white or colour?
- Black and white.
Wait a minute. Give me those.
Hey, I've got some pictures in there.
Don't worry, you'll get them processed for nothing.
- Right. Let's go.
- Go where? I don't want to go anywhere.
Fleet Street. You'll get your roll back and a dozen free. Take you 10 minutes.
I don't care a tinker's damn about this eclipse of the sun as such.
The evening papers will cane it.
It'll be dead by tomorrow morning.
But what I do care about is why there's been an eclipse of the sun
10 days before it was due.
Bill, this is your department.
I don't know why everybody regards me as Nostradamus.
- Your guess is as good as mine.
- Yes, but I don't want guesses, I want facts.
Try someone on top. Sir John Kelly.
What about the Astronomer
Royal at Herstmonceux?
Stenning got in to see Kelly.
- He had 28 fully armed guards around him.
- Yes, but what did he say?
He wouldn't even say good night, in case it was taken as an official comment on the future of mankind.
Which convinces me even more that information's being withheld in Downing Street.
Here, we can't use this. Take it across to the Evening Standard.
And if you're quick with it, they might be able to make the first late night.
- I'll send a messenger right away.
- Never mind about a messenger, it's your picture.
Follow it through yourself.
Does anyone really care about the weather after the bashing they've just had?
I agree. We're lucky to have any sun to eclipse.
You know something, sir?
I only know what I read in these agency reports, and I only know what
I see on this map.
Southern France, Sicily, Libya.
Ten days of torrential rain in their peak summer months.
The Nile flooding the Egyptian deserts for the first time in known history.
Look. It's a straight line, follow it down.
Here's Western Australia.
Arid wastes two feet deep in water.
New Zealand, floods.
And at home, an untabled eclipse.
Are we suggesting it has something to do with the double bomb?
Oh, sure. We blew the moon ahead of its schedule.
I'm not joking about this, are you?
Look, all I know is what
I read in the papers.
There may be some after-effects, atmospherically, due to the bomb,
- but quite frankly, I wouldn't know.
- Well, I want to know.
- Can you give us anything to go on?
- Nothing.
Except that I've heard that the boffins are running around like lunatics putting bits and pieces together that might add up to a very big story indeed.
I want it, and I want it first.
Is that clear, then?
I want it first, whatever it is.
Just announced, Sir John Kelly's on television and radio before the 1:00 news.
He'll have a lot of hecklers.
As I am sure, most of you will know, a solar eclipse occurs as a result of the interposition of the moon between the Earth and the Sun.
And that, children, is how the little bunny rabbit got his fluffy white tail.
When one considers the moon is 240,000 miles away and the sun 93 million, it is an extraordinary thing that astronomers can tell with such a degree of accuracy what their movements will be many years ahead.
Now, what does that mean?
- It means he doesn't know what it's all about.
- Right.
...start searching for wild causes.
In this case, many of you will blame the unfortunate concurrence of the two nuclear detonations.
But, of course, this is nonsense.
- It is certainly nothing to worry about.
- Of course not.
It's all good, clean fun.
Just light the blue paper and retire to a safe distance.
Get me another drink, will you?
Come on, then. Out you get.
What shall we go on now?
Let's go on this one.
- What, again?
- Yes, let's go on it again.
- No, let's go on the ghost train.
- Well, we haven't much time left.
Yes, we have! Yes, we have!
- Come on, then.
- Good!
Out you get.
Alley-oop!
Let's go in again.
I wish we had time, Mike.
You shouldn't take him into that place, Mr Stenning, it makes him dream.
We'll have to go back now.
No! I'm going to stay here forever.
I'm going to live here.
- Now, don't be silly.
- No, you better go now, Mike. It's almost 1:00.
And will we go on the ghost train next Sunday?
Yes, we will.
You really make things very difficult for me, Mr Stenning.
Good-bye then, Daddy.
Good-bye, son.
Now, come along, Michael, or your mother'll be angry.
One of each.
Well, it just shows you what the sun brings out.
Quite a day to jump in a pool, isn't it?
Made any good connections lately?
Please. This is my day off.
Come the revolution, and we'll all have Sunday off.
I have to be in the office two hours ago.
I hate to think of them trying to print that great big paper without you.
- Tell me something, Miss, er...
- "Miss Er" will do.
Are you anti-press or just anti-me?
On the contrary, I wish you the best of luck on your prowl.
You'll find the bikini section of the forest nearer the river.
- Why don't you howl over there.
- Oh, come on, now, what did I do?
- What...?
- I know, I know.
I shouted at you on the phone.
But that was four weeks ago, does there have to be a blood feud?
Besides, I was under stress and sober at that time.
It was my first day on that board.
I did some terrible things.
I connected Mr Holroyd with his wife and he though he was talking to his...
Oh, dear. I shouldn't have told you that.
Why not? It made my day.
No, a switchboard is very confidential, and an Air Ministry one is even more "very".
How "very" is your phone number?
- It's a bad line. You get nothing but crackle.
- I love crackle.
You're sitting on my skirt.
Oh, sorry. Look, there's a lunch place down there by the boating pool.
We could get fish and chips and pretend we're in Venice.
Sundays I don't eat lunch.
- Okay, Miss Er.
- And that's not feuding, it's dieting.
- Dinner?
- No. Tonight's hair wash night.
Well, that lets out breakfast, because I can't stand those pins.
If you turn over quick, you can lose an eye.
Well, I suppose that's the end of our summer.
Well, we'd better get on the main road while we can still find our way there.
I've got to get my things first.
I left them over here.
Don't you get lost as well.
No, not that way. That's the river.
- Okay, I found them.
- Well, that's great.
Now, do you think you can find me?
- Keep talking.
- Control to Miss Er. Control to Miss Er.
Waiting for you to come on in.
Come on in. The water's fine.
- What about this?
- It's terrible, isn't it?
Anyone with that kid?
Sounds like a lost child somewhere.
Hello there. Are you lost? Now, stop crying.
We're lost, too, and we're not crying, are we?
Who did you come here with?
Mummy? Daddy?
What's your name, sweetie?
Well, we seem to have made a big impact here.
What do you think we should do?
Well, there's only one thing to do.
The three of us must head for the nearest cave, face the future with courage and vow to carry on the human race.
There's usually a policeman at the main gate.
My name's Peter.
Won't you tell me yours?
Well, we'll just have to call her Miss Erjunior.
Make it senior.
I'm changing mine to Jeannie.
- Jeannie what?
- Craig. Is that all right?
Yeah. Most suitable.
Sort of Scotch, like the mist.
There you are.
Now you're taller than all of us.
- It's not like normal fog, is it?
- Heat mist.
- What, this thick?
- Well, it's your switchboard, you should know.
Let's get out of the road.
How you doing up there, partner?
See anyone you know?
So?
You look as if you're used to carrying children.
My doctor says I have the perfect figure for it.
Also, I have a child of my own.
- We found an abandoned lady in the park.
- But she won't talk.
- Well, now, and your what's name, my dear?
- Trixie.
- And who did you come up with, Trixie?
- Rita.
Well, you stay with me, and we'll wait for Rita to come out, all right?
Yes.
- Where do you live?
- Embankment Terrace.
Come on, we'd better hop on this.
Bloody marvellous, isn't it?
Clear as a bell on the top deck.
We've had the lot this summer?
Not yet, but there'll be three feet of snow by teatime.
You don't want to joke about that.
Looks spooky, doesn't it?
I'm fascinated to know what your friend Holroyd makes of this.
He's not my friend. I just work for him now and then.
- And turn down all his passes?
- He's harmless.
Nobody's harmless, not if they're normal.
- And you're normal?
- So far.
There's very few of us normals left, you know. You should always be nice to us.
Is it a boy or a girl?
Your child?
A boy.
- Are you married?
- Divorced.
I meet him there once a week.
He likes the funfair.
All kids do, don't they?
He wants to live there, on the ghost train, if it can be rented reasonably.
Sounds like our cue to walk.
Hello, hello, hello. Sorry,
I was following the white line.
Sorry, this station's closed for the time being. I'm sorry, sir.
No trains for a while, madam.
Looks as if the Underground's closed.
Will you wait while I phone the office?
- Sorry, sir, the station's closed.
- I'm press. I only want to use the phone.
If I let you in, they'd all want to.
It's chaos down there as it is.
Why? What happened?
Well, this fog's coming down the air shafts and along the tunnels.
It's a good thing you live within groping distance. Which way?
That way.
We turn left in a minute, about 20 yards.
You time it, I'll pace it.
One, two, three...
What comes after three? Oh, yes...
There's a telephone in my flat if you care to use it.
- Without prejudice, of course.
- Naturally.
I'm turning left.
I don't know about you.
Yes, please? Oh, Miss Craig.
- Quite a day, isn't it?
- Certainly is, miss.
There's just been a fog warning.
- The whole country's covered in it.
- That's Britain today.
What we have, we share.
You know, they say, it's not what you call a true fog.
More like a sort of heat mist.
Heavier than your typical fog, it is.
- Thanks for the breakdown.
- Hey, mister. Where are we, mister?
- Ask him, Dad.
- Where are we, mister?
- We're trying to find the coach station.
- Ask him, Mum.
- I just asked him.
- No, I want to go to the toilet.
You wait till the coach station.
Tell her, Dad.
You wait till the coach station.
- Oh, the coach station.
- Yeah.
You want to try and get to the embankment.
- Look, I'll show you.
- That's right, the embankment.
Now, now, keep going till you come to the T-road, right?
- Brings you straight onto the embankment.
- Where are we, mate?
- Embankment Crescent.
- Just shows. It should be Sloane Square.
I've gotta go, Mum.
Why you can't wait?
It's the same at the pictures.
Well, I don't know. I shouldn't think they'll be running many coaches in this fog.
Oh, dear.
Really, it's stifling.
Are there more expensive apartments above the mist line?
- Looks fantastic, doesn't it?
- With a bit of luck, it'll go on forever.
You came to telephone, Mr Stenning.
- Aren't you even going to offer me a drink?
- Yes, if you don't mind instant coffee.
Coffee? What are you trying to do, corrupt me?
- The phone's by the bed.
- Nice and handy to call for help.
So far, I haven't had to call for help.
That's your fault or his?
- There doesn't happen to be a "his".
- I'm not surprised.
And what exactly does that mean?
Well, If they all get the same treatment that I got...
You happened to walk in at the end of a black Monday.
What about a foggy Sunday?
Come on, now, Pete.
We're too old for...
I'm not too old.
I said you could use the phone, and that's all.
Oh, come on now, Jeannie.
What do you want, a slow build-up?
Hot hands at the movies?
Knee troubles at a coffee bar?
This seems to be where we came in.
Do me a favour, just use the phone and go.
Lady says you gotta go, you gotta go.
You don't dial. The porter gets it.
I'm sorry, Jeannie.
You're a case,
Pete Stenning, a real case.
Yep, that's me, "Knock 'em down, drag 'em out Pete Stenning,
"the battered caveman."
Fleet Street 8000, please.
What is this "look at me,
I'm so tough" act?
Oh, I am tough, Jeannie.
Tough and chewed up.
- Not the way you drink.
- Bill Maguire.
Alcoholics take it because they can't take it. I read that in The Guardian.
What do you know about me and drink?
It's in the Met Centre facts of life file.
Dogs bark, cats meow and Stenning drinks.
- Yeah?
- Bill, this is Pete.
I'll make the coffee.
Yeah, we seem fated to be apart, don't we?
As soon as I can.
Stupidly, I forgot to pack my radar kit this morning.
Half the boys have been caught short, so you won't be missed.
What's your number there, in case?
How long will you be there?
Well, just as long as it takes to make and drink a cup of instant coffee.
Yes, coffee. No, it's not a pub.
More a sort of a club, really.
Jeannie's Club.
Yes. I am a temporary dis-honourary member.
You wanna watch that coffee kick, before you know it you'll be joining Caffeine's Anonymous.
What the hell kind of fog only comes up to the fourth floor?
It knows better than to come up here.
This place is like the anteroom to hell.
It's really chaos at London airport, Mr Maguire.
It usually is.
The question is, how do we get home tonight?
Yes, I know. Isn't it wonderful?
And New York is still clear?
Yeah, Shannon's closing in.
Hold on. News desk.
Yes, sir, I'll bring them in.
Yeah, I've got that.
Madrid, Lisbon, New York, clear.
Right? Check back in an hour.
News conference, now.
The gaffer says you too.
Yeah, I know, he wants a 50-word by-line from the Almighty.
Hate to think what the roads back from the coast are gonna be like tonight.
I know what I'm gonna be like. I promised myself a night of booze and orgy for years.
Where's this great exhibition gonna take place?
I shall grope my way over to Harry's.
And who's the orgy going to be with? May?
If you can keep Harry busy.
Now, get me Professor Jacovski,
US Weather Bureau, Washington DC.
And I don't want his assistant, his secretary or his wife.
Make it person-to-person.
Well, boys, this is going to be a night of nights.
If we're gonna catch the trains, we'll have to go to press at least an hour earlier.
- Can't be done.
- It's got to be done.
We've got to play this mist, and we've got to play it big.
I want to give it saturation coverage.
I want a recap on the rain, the heat wave, the eclipse.
I want a comparison of the statistics and weather charts going right back to the first meteorological reports in 1854.
You can go back as far as Galileo, if you like.
I want to know if anything like these conditions has ever happened in recorded history.
- What pictures have you got?
- We've got some shot from our roof.
That's no good. Let's have an aerial panorama of London above the fog.
Aerial? In this place?
Well, get a helicopter.
It's only got to go up and down.
Send Benny to the heliport now before the light goes.
Where is everybody? Most of them are still trying to get back.
The night staff haven't shown at all yet.
If it's a heat mist, it can't last long.
"If" being the operative word.
We've all seen a heat mist that rises a few feet above the ground in hot weather, but this one's four storeys high.
And in two hours it's virtually paralysed a third of the globe.
Look, France, Italy, here and even India.
What sort of treatment, Jeff?
Do we still link the bombs?
We do, and we go on linking them until someone up top proves how we're wrong.
- I want something from you on this, Bill.
- Yes, I was afraid of that.
- Any angles?
- Oh, a couple.
This mist could be caused by an unusual amount of condensation from the unusual heat following all that rain.
- Alternatively...
- Alternatively what?
Well, this is just a personal guess.
I wouldn't dare to put it into print.
Let me decide what goes into print. You just give.
Could be caused by a mass of extremely cold water
- penetrating into the warmer currents.
- What's that mean?
An unusual amount of melting ice at both poles.
Surely that would also mean floods.
They've already had them in
Australia and New Zealand.
Are you telling me that the heat of the bombs melted the ice caps?
No, sir. That wouldn't melt enough ice to flood the Isle of Wight.
But if they did go off together...
Supposing the combined thrust of the explosions shifted the tilt of the Earth.
Oh, come on, Bill.
That would alter the climatic regions, a complete change in the world's weather.
A new ice age for some, new tropics, a new Equator.
I don't know what else, it's all guesswork.
It's all science fiction.
So were rockets to the moon and manned satellites.
We're gonna have to move, sir.
Yes? Right? Miss Evans?
All right, move and hit hard.
Bill, write your story. I'm not sold on it, but I'll print it.
It might force something big.
Professor Jakovski.
Just a minute, please. Hold on.
We'll try it on him. Any quotes, you will get them.
Professor Jakovski?
This is the Daily Express, London.
You're not getting any fancy flying.
The deal is straight up, straight down.
Don't think this is my favourite assignment, 'cause it isn't.
Now we're up, what about a look at London airport?
Some things just aren't possible.
My orders are, everything's possible, even the Indian rope trick.
You may need that to get down.
May I have your attention, please.
All flight departures have been delayed for another hour.
Travel information may be obtained from the information desk opposite channel 7.
London approach.
Speedbird 352 leaving Watford.
Roger, 352.
Descend to 2,000 feet on your present heading.
2,000 feet. Roger.
Sorry, KLM 603. Have to return you.
Priority transatlantic only.
KLM 603. What is the
Amsterdam weather?
Hello, 603.
Visibility, 50 yards in fog.
Speedbird 352 intercepting the ILS beam at 2,000 feet.
Roger, 352. The runway visibility now is 80 yards.
Oh, no.
Okay, Colonel, let down the drawbridge.
You been to Fleet
Street already, sir?
I've been on a hike where all streets turn left and all roads lead to home.
Fortunately, I found this in a sand dune just past Benghazi.
It's getting hotter, too. 91 degrees.
It's gonna be quite a summer.
Well, let us share a toast, Colonel.
I give you this battered and benumbed world of sweaty moles and radio static.
- You can have it.
- Oh, thanks very much, sir.
We interrupt this programme to bring you further Air Ministry bulletin.
The freak mist which has hit the British isles is likely to increase in density for the next few hours.
And the best of British luck.
The police have asked the public to keep the roads clear for essential transport and avoid traffic congestion by arranging, where possible, to stay where they are.
I think our British police are wonderful.
Where's the house phone?
Over there, sir.
We return you now to late night dance music.
- Hello?
- Guess who.
Clever girl. Were you asleep?
No, I was just washing my hair.
Did you make it all right?
I certainly did, I'm back downstairs.
Well, it's a two-hour story.
You listening to the radio?
Did you hear that bulletin?
So, are you pro-police or anti-police?
Yes. Yes, I'm still with you.
I was just trying to work out all the permutations.
There's only two of them.
You can send me out into the cold, cold snow and let me get lost with the rest of the kids, or you can utter two one-syllable words and become a law-abiding citizen.
Can you be one, too?
Well, since this thing seems to be bigger than both of us...
- I'm beginning to think you arranged this.
- But of course.
You look cute, sort of boyish.
I am. Well, just remember, you're normal.
Yes.
Well, this is all very sweet and spontaneous.
I don't mind sleeping on the couch.
Haven't got a couch.
Oh, in that case, I'll cuddle up on the floor at the bottom of your bed like a faithful Saint Bernard.
Oh no, you won't.
Can't we just have a flaming fog flare between us?
Won't be necessary. If you're staying, you're sleeping in here.
I've got a feeling you've been through all this before.
- I have not.
- You mean, I'm the first man you've managed to trap up here for the night?
It's perfectly comfortable with a pillow and a couple of sheets.
Excuse me.
Well, supposing you want to use the bathroom in the night?
We'll deal with each problem as we get to it.
I have a big problem, Jeannie.
As well as being normal, I'm human.
You're also a pushover, Pete.
Meaning you're not interested.
Maybe I could be, but don't make it so easy. Be hard to get.
Make me fight for you.
It's an unfair contest.
Well, who knows, you might even be lovable.
But don't rush me.
I'm allergic to one-night stands.
Now if you'll give me five minutes,
I'll finish my hair.
Normally I'd offer to help, but in the circumstances...
In the circumstances, you can take a well-earned nightcap.
There should be a bottle of something in the kitchen.
I forgot, Saint Bernards' carry their own.
- You'll get a glass in there, too.
- Maybe I will.
Maybe I won't.
- Did you find it?
- Yes, I found it.
Look, if I've got to play hard-to-get for you to go steady with me, how about a few immigration details?
- Such as?
- Oh, where you slept for the last seven years.
Have you ever suffered from marriage, divorce or any similar virus?
Only two near infections.
Any other inquiries?
No, the rest seems to be all right.
Maybe I will.
One or two pillows?
Oh, I'll just wedge my head between the taps.
I'd offer you a pair of my pyjamas, but it's a bit hot, isn't it?
Yeah. You wouldn't like to come into my place for a drink?
- It's against the house rules.
- You like your guests sober.
I like you sober.
Good night, Jeannie.
Good night, Pete.
And thanks, for the use of the bathroom.
You're welcome.
Sleep well.
Hello?
Jeannie's Club?
Oh, yes. Just a minute.
- Pete!
- Yeah?
Phone.
So, what do we do now?
Can you push it under the door?
Come and get it, idiot.
Just a minute, please.
Sorry. It must be the office.
Yes? Stenning here.
We just put the first edition to bed without you. I hope that's all right.
Okay, okay. It caught you there, it caught me here. There's no justice.
But just to even things up, you can call round at the
Met Centre tomorrow morning and get me some comparative ice floe figures for the last 20 years.
You'll be surprised at what
I might bring you tomorrow.
I've... I've made a new contact.
Well, they're rather fussy about new members.
You have to be vouched for by two friends, and you don't have two friends.
Yeah, you too, you vulgar man.
Compromised while telephoning.
- What does it all mean, Pete?
- It means you'll probably have to marry me.
I mean the mist and this crazy weather. What is it?
Don't ask me. You know more about what's going on than I do.
- Oh, but Bill...
- Oh, come on now, Jeannie.
You've been running around that office for months, trying to hide signs of the elephants that passed.
I don't understand half the things I hear anyway.
Such as? I'm no mastermind, but such as?
Be fair. I'm not even supposed to be talking to you.
So far, that's all you've done.
- Let's change the subject, shall we?
- To what?
- Pete Stenning.
- Too dull.
- What happened, Pete?
- What, "What happened"?
They say you used to be a writer.
Look, let's just put that subject on the same list as the weather, shall we?
Well, that leaves us with nothing to talk about.
Do we have to talk?
- No, but seriously...
- I'm not unserious, Jeannie.
- Your bath's getting cold.
- Look, Jeannie.
I don't wanna make love to you.
I don't wanna hold you or kiss you, because you don't appeal to me one little bit.
But please fight for me, Jeannie.
Do you think it will last a long time?
- The fog?
- Us.
Why do women worry about the end right at the beginning.
- I'm not women.
- I mean...
- I know what you mean.
- So move over, then.
Even though ye hide in the secret places of the Earth, ye shall be found out for the last judgement.
Come with me. Repent!
Morning, Sarge. Anyone in yet?
A few. Most of the night duty staff have only just left.
Cost a fortune in overtime, it will.
Well, there you are, boy.
Just relax and get rich.
Oh, the lift's out of order. When the power failed, it blew a fuse or something.
I'm liable to do the same in this heat.
- Another cyclone, in Greece.
- Another one, or the same one?
Casualties aren't quite so high.
Boy! Greece, Italy, France and us.
We're still along the old man's same line.
- Mr Maguire, ask him to follow it through.
- Yes, sir.
Jacko says will you follow this through, Mr Maguire?
- Thank you. Did he send any Benzedrine?
- Benzedrine?
Skip it. Get me a cold drink, will you?
If I'm asleep when you fetch it, nudge me.
- Yes, sir.
- I can't hear you.
If Le Bourget is out, try one of the private flying clubs.
Or get them by road to Brussels.
We've got to have those pictures.
Yes, they'll get a credit.
No, I don't want the small roads, just the main highway diversions.
Paris Match has got pictures as it crossed the Seine.
- When do we get them?
- A couple of hours, with luck.
It almost wrecked Le Bourget.
The other airports are jammed.
We'll need a photo news extra.
I hope nobody kicks about the price.
Photo news. Bill, there's an extra page going out.
Hi, Jacko. Like the old Blitz days, isn't it?
Where the hell were you all yesterday?
You may remember there was a mist that covered...
You may remember that was in the afternoon.
I wasn't drunk, and I wasn't drinking, if that's what you're suggesting.
I'm suggesting wherever you were you'd have been of more use here.
It so happens, I made a new contact at the Met Centre yesterday...
- Anything usable?
- Not yet.
Anyway, Bill Maguire knew where to reach me all day.
Unfortunately Bill Maguire doesn't pay you, Peter.
No, sir.
Hello, Mr Stenning.
What about that cyclone?
- First one ever in Europe. Did you know that?
- I do now. Thank you.
They had a whirlwind in Greece, too.
Give me that, or you'll have one right up your backside.
- It's not very cold. The fridge packed up.
- You've been here all night?
Oh, don't ask. I'm still recovering.
Any damage up your end?
A few windows broken.
It just skirted us.
Still. At least it blew the mist away.
- Why don't you blow yourself?
- Oh, don't sort the kid out.
- The temperature's not his fault.
- Yes, it's not my fault.
- Oh, shut up!
- All right, all right.
Why does the whole world have to drink this stuff?
I understand there was organised chaos here last night.
The old man put the edition forward one hour to beat the fog.
Comes the cyclone, a complete change-up with only half-staff.
Oh, it's bloody hot.
98 degrees on the Air Ministry roof.
Think of all those WAAFs stripped to the fuselage. What's this?
Library clips. Cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes. It's all there.
West Pacific, northern Australia,
Madagascar, Bay of Bengal.
List the figures for me, will you?
Rate of advance, acceleration and casualties.
Why don't I just do 500 steaming words on how mankind is so full of wind
- it's about to out-blow nature.
- Yeah, fine. But after you've done my figures.
Yes, of course.
- Oh, give me those ice floe figures, will you?
- Ice floe?
You mean you didn't go to the Met Centre?
Oh, those. Yes, I went.
I dropped Jeannie off.
All right, all right. She's the new contact.
Works there. She's calling them through.
You, of course, were too busy to get them.
She only has to look up the files,
I thought it more important to be here this morning.
- Not to me, it isn't.
- Apparently.
Well, you'll be glad to hear I've just about had the whole issue.
That's up to you, chum.
Okay, so the knife's penetrated deep. Can I go now?
Oh, sit down, Pete.
Give her a ring.
Our switchboard's probably jammed.
Get me the Met Centre, please.
- Could I speak to you for a moment, Sandy?
- Oh, not now, Pete.
It won't take a minute.
Look, all I want to do is finish this lot and get some sleep.
- I wanna turn it in.
- Do what?
- Turn in my job, jack it in, resign.
- I can't stop you...
Look, I am sick of being the ass end of Bill Maguire's donkey.
Why don't you leave it till the temperature drops.
- We're all a little edgy.
- I'm like a cub reporter here!
"Phone up for figures, run down to the library,
"take these pictures." What am I?
You're getting paid for it, aren't you?
Look, it's not so long ago, this paper put out posters telling the public to read my stuff.
And you stopped writing it, so how could we go on printing it?
Look, Pete, I'll forget you resigned.
Give it a few days.
Anyway, I thought Bill Maguire was a friend of yours.
- Yeah.
- He always behaved like a friend.
- Sanderson.
- Yeah, maybe it's the heat.
For you.
Think about it.
Yeah, I will.
Stenning, who's that?
It's Jeannie. Pete,
I've got to talk to you.
It's serious. I can't, not on the phone.
I've got to see you.
You will tonight, remember?
Well, if it's that urgent, hop a cab and come here.
I can't. I'm in a telephone box and I've got to get back.
Listen, I'll take an early lunch.
The restaurant by the boating lake.
All right, Jeannie.
- Okay?
- Oh, yeah, it's a new contact
I found at the Met Office.
She, seems to have something on her mind.
Met Office? Has she got a story?
Well, frankly, I don't think she'd notice a news story if it was in 72-point. Still,
I don't think we should ignore it.
- Well, she's your contact.
- All right.
But you're my witness for the defence when Stenning's found missing again.
What are you, a cub reporter?
Go on, get out.
Well, of all people. It must be three hours since we met.
There's too many people here.
Who's shy? I only want to kiss you.
Look, Pete, I mustn't be seen talking to you.
I know, you're a Russian spy.
All right, I'll come to Moscow with you.
Oh, Pete, please be serious.
Never more so. Come on, tovarish.
- But you don't understand...
- So, you're going to tell me.
Now, get in the carriage. Go on.
No expense spared with Stenning.
Well, what could be more private?
- Pete, I...
- Take your time, I bought a double ride.
- Have you got a cigarette?
- Sure.
This morning, half of the girls didn't get in, so some of us had to go on the switchboard again.
And?
Well, I've overheard things before.
Sometimes you can't help it, but you keep it to yourself.
A switchboard is very confidential, especially a government...
But this morning?
You've got to promise me you won't use this.
Is it about the big question mark?
- Then how can I promise?
- You must.
Oh, for God's sake, Jeannie.
If something's gone wrong, don't you think people are entitled to know?
The people at the top are cleverer than we are. They know what they're doing.
- Then why tell me?
- Because I had to tell someone or bust.
I thought you were the one person
I could tell. Maybe I was wrong.
No, you weren't wrong,
Jeannie. Now, go on.
I didn't understand very much of it, but what I did understand...
I don't know, I panicked and called you.
So, here I am.
I want your promise.
All right. Let's have it.
Got it! All right, all right. May!
Two hot lagers for the Daily Sketch.
You're lucky, I've got two nice ones on ice.
No, you haven't. I just sold them.
I told you to hang onto those in case Mr Maguire wanted them.
- I never heard you.
- You never hear anything.
- You can't keep ice in this weather.
- No. Three hot Scotch's.
Good for the circulation.
Personal not professional.
- There you are, Mr Maguire.
- Thanks, May.
I need you, Dad, and you need that, so drink it.
Put them on the slate, May, will you?
I heard a funny story on my way to the park this morning.
How funny?
What's the nutation of the Earth?
Nutation? Well, it's a slight oscillation on the Earth's axis.
It's caused by the pull of the sun and the moon on the Equator.
It's changed.
You see, there's a slight bulge on the...
There's also an item here about axis rotation.
There's been an 11 -degree variation, whatever that may mean.
- Where'd this come from?
- Never mind where it came from. Translate it.
- It means I was right.
- Well, congratulations.
They've shifted the tilt of the Earth.
The stupid, crazy, irresponsible bastards!
They've finally done it.
That's the normal angle of tilt.
An 11-degree variation would put it this way, or there.
- We don't know whether it's east or west.
- No.
Your weather line theory would indicate an east-to-west tilt.
Where did you get this story, Stenning?
I prefer you not to ask, sir.
Get me Sir John Kelly, either at his office or at his home.
Wherever he is I want to talk to him.
Does this come from your new contact?
Never mind where it comes from.
You take my word, that's the story.
What can it do to us, Bill, apart from altering the Earth's climates?
Monkeying around with nature on this scale, who knows what the implications are.
Well, what do you think?
I prefer not to.
Yes? I didn't ask for the PRO.
- All right, put him through.
- Who is it?
- Holroyd, sir.
- Holroyd.
Get Jacko in. Get everybody in.
Holroyd, this is Jefferson, the editor of the Daily Express here.
Yes, well, you can tell Sir John that he has the choice of being disturbed now or when he reads his morning paper.
We're going to print whether he talks or not.
Bill, get moving. I want a pictorial panorama of the world as it's going to be with the new climatic zones and all the rest of it changed.
Stenning, come in on this phone.
Take this down.
Sir John Kelly, Jefferson here.
I'd like a statement and I'd like it now.
Nothing's impossible. Not even an
11-degree tilt in the globe's axis.
Yes, that's precisely what we're going to print.
Mornin', sir.
What about all this, then?
"World tips over."
Fog, cyclone and flood?
- Jeannie, what else could I do?
- I don't want to hear, I don't want to know.
It had to come out, Jeannie.
You couldn't sit on a thing like this.
That's right, that's right.
But we didn't use your name, Jeannie.
Nobody used your name.
Who cares about my name? My name's nothing, it's my trust you've used.
All right, I'm ready.
- Who are you?
- I'm a security officer.
Now, wait a minute.
Where are you taking her?
For the moment, into preventative custody.
- For what?
- Can we go now, please?
What the hell are you preventing?
It's happened, man!
You've got the head weathercock sitting on the biggest addled egg the human race has ever laid.
Leave us alone, Pete. It's none of your business any more.
You let these bloody bombs off as though they were four penny squibs on bonfire night, and you want to keep it a secret!
Fine, fine. So they stick the kid into preventative custody.
Oh, cool off. I know it's hot, but cool off.
Never mind the data on leukaemia or infant mortality or strontium g, or any of the other clinical facts of mass suicide.
Just stick some kid in a cell and everything will be all right.
Go on, write about it like that.
Oh, sure, now they want to read about the filthy, self-destructive force humanity carries around rotting in its belly.
Now, when it's too late.
It's never too late for a good story well written.
The human race has been poisoning itself for years with a great big smile on its fat face.
Well, that's how it is, Pete.
People don't care about the news until it becomes personal.
Well, it has become personal for me.
Isn't there anything you can do?
What else is there to do?
I've made my will.
Look, Pete, they're just a bit hysterical like the rest of us.
- They'll let her out in a few days.
- Let her out to do what?
- Who's gonna give her a job?
- No problem there, we'll give her a job.
While it all still lasts, we might as well have full employment.
I felt it necessary to speak to you all, if only to stop the many wild and irresponsible rumours precipitated by a general lack of facts.
There has indeed been a displacement in the direction of the polar axis.
But it is not a catastrophe, nor is it the millennium.
Geologists and astronomers have long had evidence that the tilt of the Earth has been altered more than once in the history of its evolution, and it has survived them all.
Now, what does this mean to us in our daily lives?
Well, some of the seasons, as we know them, may be disturbed and change their intensity.
This displacement has undoubtedly brought some regions nearer to the polar circle, whilst others have been carried further from it.
But I have the utmost confidence the world's scientists can produce solutions for any of the climactic problems we are likely to meet.
I know that many of you are blaming the combined effects of nuclear tests for this disturbance to the motion of the Earth.
I must tell you that the majority of the world's scientists deny that this is the cause.
However, I would be failing in my duty if I did not admit to you that there are many others who believe it could have been.
But whatever the rights, or whatever the wrongs, the four major powers have now reached unconditional agreement to cease all further tests, experiments, manufacture and work on nuclear projects.
What they'll do to get votes.
I ask you now to face the future calmly and constructively, remembering that here in Britain, at least, the weather is something we are used to coping with.
I wonder who writes his punch lines.
The old boy will need all the laughs he can get if this heat keeps up.
No, leave it on, May.
Let's hear the forecast.
Yes, it's always so right.
I wouldn't mind the heat if this stupid old fool would remember to order the ice.
- I did order it.
- Well, where is it?
I don't deliver it, May.
It's real bikini weather, May.
Yeah, give the boys a treat, May.
I don't know. All this heat's making you lot behave like foreigners.
No point in holding a hot glass.
Have another one.
No, I'm going back to the office.
...with a probable rise towards the weekend.
What's on your mind?
Do you think Jeff would give me an advance?
Depends how much.
However much it'd cost to get her a good lawyer.
Oh, stop worrying. She'll only be in for a week, two at most.
They're just going through the motions.
But she didn't break the story, Bill, I did.
If they're gonna charge anyone, it should be me.
Look, you brought in the beat of the century...
- Covent Garden!
- ...enjoy it.
- What is it, Dick?
- The whole lot's as dry as a bone.
They think it's all going up.
All right, clear way!
Please keep the roads clear.
Clear the roads, please.
Keep out of the roads.
Don't cause obstructions, please.
Keep the roads clear.
Please keep the roads clear.
Clear the roads, please.
This is the editorial floor.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Is this where I work?
Through the newsroom and down into the library.
By the way, I'd better warn you about some of these newsroom characters.
- I'm a big girl now.
- Yeah, that's what I mean.
Mr Maguire, if you ever want
- any extra water...
- Never drink it.
I mean I've got a contact.
Five-gallon drum only costs a pound.
Great, we'll celebrate with two iced Cokes.
- They're fetching four bob apiece now.
- Are they?
- I'll get them as soon as I drop these.
- Tell them they're bloody robbers!
Relax, he's out on a date, if that makes any difference.
Not to me, it doesn't.
Look, Jeannie, you can't go on blaming him for blowing that story you gave him.
Can we change the subject?
No journalist would have any right not to!
I agree. Tell me, do I always come in this way, or is there some sort of tradesman's entrance?
Yes, I'll mind my own business.
Now, these are the legal gentlemen the brothers prodnose.
This is the chief bunch here.
Jacko, Miss Craig, library and standby switchboard.
- Hello and welcome.
- Thank you.
All I can say is whoever took your press pictures ought to be fired.
What's the lead? "Hospital emergency water trucks rammed."
- Yeah, they grabbed 5,000 gallons.
- Marvellous, isn't it?
I can remember when it used to be money.
I must say, this is all a bit frightening.
Nothing to worry about, unless you own a reservoir.
- No, I meant the job.
- Oh, you'll get numb to it.
The chief librarian's a nice guy.
He'll put you right.
If there's any special problem, there's always me, or Pete.
Everything's filed here, from the atom bomb to Zen Buddhism.
Well, I appreciate the motive, but don't try and restart anything. It's very, very over.
Oh, break down, Jeannie.
What, do you want him in the penitents parade, walking barefooted down Fleet Street?
- I don't want him anywhere.
- This is no time to waste time.
Well, he isn't wasting it.
He's out on a date.
In Battersea Park with his kid.
Miss Craig.
- You found your way?
- Mr Maguire brought me.
Yes, I shouldn't think we'd ever be lonely down here now.
Look after her, Archie.
She's a bright girl.
It's just her sense of proportion that's a bit bent.
Here we are. Eight shillings worth of deliciously hot Coke.
Take that to Miss Craig, will you?
What's the matter, kid?
Oh, I'm all right, sir.
Holy smoke, look at these temperatures!
Mexico delta, 145.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
USA, Texas, 141 .3.
Rome, 139.
This famine death count's pretty terrifying, isn't it?
I just don't get this lack of water.
What about all this extra polar ice that's melting?
Well, the heat's taking it up as vapour.
Yeah, but doesn't it come down again sometime?
It does. And when it does, pray you're on high ground?
Hi.
All right, no hi.
- Dave, I just came from Battersea Park...
- Personally, I prefer Brighton.
Look, something's going on.
If you're not interested, to hell with it.
Unwind, for God's sake.
How do I know if I'm interested?
What sort of something?
Well, they're putting up long sheds, you know, the army type.
And there's trucks full of piping and shower bath fittings.
500 gallon water tanks complete with purifying systems...
- Battersea Park?
- Yeah. And Hyde Park, Richmond,
Wimbledon, Highgate, Hampstead...
Most of the open spaces.
- You've seen them?
- Only Battersea, but I talked to one of the drivers.
In the last few days he's delivered similar gear to the others.
- For what?
- I don't know, I never got that far.
- The foreman came up shouting, "Security!"
- Any ideas?
- Yes. Community washing centres.
- Good God.
Why, you got ugly neighbours?
If that's right, it means there'll be no more private water at all.
Correct. Just turn on your taps and hear the rude noise of progress.
This is Davis. You got any photographers down there?
Well, push them up here fast.
Mitchell, get on the Glasgow office.
I want a list of any similar sites in Scotland.
- You, Manchester.
- Right.
Tell them to check all main towns north of Birmingham.
Bill, have a go at the ministries.
You might surprise something out of them.
If I do, they'll surprise something out of me.
And what about us messenger boys?
Are we allowed to jump around a bit, too?
You've jumped, haven't you?
You've probably brought in a hell of a beat.
- But I'm not capable of writing it.
- Oh, relax, for...
This is Davis, sir. Stenning's brought in a lead to something that could be big.
Well, it looks like they're about to cut all running water.
Yeah, but I'd like him to talk to you before he writes anything.
Well, they seem to be putting up community showers in all the parks.
All right, I'll send him in.
Pete! Go tell the old man.
Well, we're getting pictures...
What about the hospitals?
Well, try them.
If it's going to happen, they're bound to know about it.
They'll have made special arrangements.
And if anything comes through on the tapes, let me know.
- You actually saw these showers?
- About 50 of them at the Battersea Hut.
I wouldn't like you to make guesses about things like this, there's too much panic about as it is.
Sorry, Clive Macreedy on the phone from Moscow.
- Moscow?
- It's urgent. It's a very bad line.
A wonder it got through at all.
Clive? Hello? Clive?
Yes, I can't hear you.
Yes.
Yes, I've got it.
I only wish I didn't believe it.
I expect you'd like to come home now.
Is anything still flying?
Well, it's up to you.
You can if you wish.
Shall I get on with it?
- Conference, fast!
- Right, sir.
Jacko!
Conference! Jacko, where the hell are you?
- Yes, sir?
- In here! Get a move on!
Miss Evans, get the old man.
I think he's at Cherkley, but wherever he is, find him.
- Yes, Mr Stenning.
- Do you want me to wait?
You have a family, don't you?
I have a son.
I'd get him to the country if you can.
I don't think things in the cities are going to be too pleasant.
- I brought the dummy in case...
- Oh, you can tear that up.
On the direct line.
Good evening, sir.
Well, the Russians have just about topped everything.
Macreedy got through from Moscow.
They held an international press conference.
Had their top scientists present.
They say that those two bangs did more than alter the tilt.
They made an 11-degree shift in our orbit.
And we're moving towards the sun.
Well, I can't see what they'd gain by making it up.
They say Western scientists have known about this all along, but were trying to work something out before they broke it.
It's not through on the agencies yet, but it's bound to be any moment.
No, of course not.
No, that's the way I was going to play it.
I'll have it put through to you.
Anyone want a recap, or did you get it?
We got it, but what the hell do we do with it?
To start with, it's two lines of
120-point across eight columns.
I'm not up on my sci-fi.
So, we're orbiting toward the sun.
- But how many billion light years...
- If that's true,
I'd say there's about four months.
Before what?
Before there's a delightful smell in the universe of charcoaled mankind.
Do you really mean four months?
According to the temperature rises in the last few weeks, yes.
- So that's the message, is it?
- About another 300 deadlines.
Is that what we say in tomorrow's paper?
Tomorrow we report the news.
The facts. We leave prophecy to the street corner cranks.
Bill, you and Sandy, start arranging interviews with top scientists.
Cockcroft, Penny, if you can, get a call through to Calcutta,
Haldane might break silence.
Pete, you get busy on the "no water" angle.
Everything affected, sanitation, electricity, power plants...
- Even down to car radiators.
- Will do.
And keep the tone of the paper reasonably optimistic. Understand?
It's going to be all right.
That's it.
- Sir, there's an agency flash!
- Yes, we just had it.
In every possible way.
My home, please.
What's it all mean?
I was going on holiday next month.
Do you think I should cancel it?
Only thing to cancel is your life insurance.
Sell up and have an orgy.
- Nice public-spirited advice.
- Oh, do me a favour.
Can't anything be done, Mr Maguire?
Yes, there's something you can do right away.
Pop off to the library.
Bring me everything
- they've got on melting points.
- Melting points?
Yes. The temperatures at which everything, from steel to my glass eye, starts to melt.
Right.
I suppose it couldn't be a mistake.
It is. The daddy of all mistakes.
Funny how, when the chopper falls, everyone just accepts it.
What else, when it's your neck under it?
A fellow up in Leeds says he's found a method of extracting water from the atmosphere.
Oh, as it were, he's been certified.
Jeff said to get the kid out of town.
It might be a bit easier in the country.
Yes, it might.
Couldn't get my old woman away from her garden.
She's got about six tonnes of sweet peas.
She'll be out buying black market water for them.
Which reminds me, this is highly illegal, too. Do you want a swig?
- No thanks.
- Quite right.
I suppose they'll do something, won't they, Bill?
What?
Well, something!
They've gotta do something.
They can't just let... Let...
- You've got a piece to write, haven't you?
- I know what I'd like to write.
You can't. It's a family newspaper.
We're all so bloody clever at outsmarting nature!
"Anything you can split I can split better."
- You know what I'd do if I were you?
- What?
Some special data waiting for you in the library.
Half an hour ago, I brought her.
Thanks. Well, in that case, we'll just skip the library.
- If you take my advice...
- You know she hasn't spoken to me since.
Well, how the hell can she speak to you in separate rooms?
Well...
I need some data anyway.
Yeah.
We all need whatever we can get.
You see, they're all cross-filed.
You have to remember what names are connected with what subjects and vice versa.
Anytime you want any help...
I'm just getting
Mr Maguire's stuff, sir.
Well, thanks.
- Yes?
- I need some...
Pete...
I need you, Jeannie.
I need you, too.
Attention, please. Attention, please.
There will be an emergency announcement of national importance by the Prime Minister at 9:00 tonight.
Stand by at 9:00 tonight for an announcement of national importance.
Please pass on this information.
Attention, please.
Attention, please. There will be an emergency announcement of national importance by the
Prime Minister at 9:00 tonight.
Stand by at 9:00 tonight for an announcement of national importance.
Attention, please.
There will be an emergency announcement of national importance by the Prime Minister at 9:00 tonight.
Stand by at 9:00 tonight...
I'm sorry, sir, no entry.
You better close this, chum.
- I'm meeting someone inside.
- Not during ration hours.
Yeah, but anyone inside will have to come out this way.
- No, don't say...
- It's no use arguing.
You can't take those in, leave them here.
- No, I want to save half my shower, see?
- You can't take water from here, this is a washing centre.
The forms, please.
I don't dig it, doll.
I mean, we're all entitled to so much water, aren't we?
Yeah, for washing. Leave them here.
- So who says if it goes over us or in us?
- Move on.
Either leave or get out of line.
Attention, please. There will be an emergency announcement.
Stand by at 9:00 tonight.
- Daddy, you weren't there!
- Oh, they wouldn't let me in, son.
- We're driving away now into the country.
- I know, Mike.
I wanted us to say good-bye to the ghost train.
Well, there isn't time now, and anyway, it's closed up.
Will it be open again sometime?
Yeah, maybe sometime.
Mummy's here. Come and see Mummy.
You can come with us.
You come with us, Daddy.
Make Daddy come with us, Mummy.
- Hello, Peter.
- Hello, Angie.
Why can't Daddy come with us?
Somebody's gotta stay and report it when the ghost train starts again.
- We'd want to know that, wouldn't we?
- I suppose so.
You're staying in London?
Paper goes on forever.
When will I see you again?
Quite soon. I'll come out and visit you. Now, go on, off you go.
I want to sit in front!
All right, but don't wriggle the whole time.
I think we ought to leave now, Angela.
- Good-bye, Peter.
- Good-bye, Angie.
- You got water in those cans?
- We saved a little.
I'd keep to the main roads.
The water gangs are pretty busy.
I won't take chances.
Good luck, Peter.
It all seems pretty ridiculous now, doesn't it?
- Yeah, pretty ridiculous. Look after the kid.
- Yeah. See you.
Maybe.
Attention, please.
There will be an emergency announcement of national importance by the Prime Minister at 9:00 tonight.
This is London.
Try and get it clearer.
Nothing much I can do, sir.
We're using every known cut-out.
What do you bet they'll have another power failure in the middle of it?
It's all right, sir. We're running on our own generator now.
- It'll have to wait for the agency copy!
- Ronnie, hop over to PA and wait for it.
Well, go on.
I feel that at this time, it is senseless to minimise the gravity of our situation or to deny the danger of the course decided upon.
Keep it quiet, please.
Perhaps it is comforting to know the decision has been taken jointly by all governments and heads of state throughout the globe acting in complete accord.
Bravo. It's only taken half a million years.
He's shaking like a jelly.
What's the matter with his tongue?
It's all swollen.
All right, try and get a doctor.
Drastic conditions demand drastic action.
Scientists are unanimous that we must attempt to change, or at least check, the movement towards the sun.
And so, all thermonuclear bombs, the largest ever devised, will be detonated simultaneously,
100 miles apart, in the west of Siberia.
And to this end, they have been working with all possible speed before conditions of heat make assembly uncontrollable.
No one, and I repeat, no one, can tell us exactly what this massive explosion will effect.
One thing is certain, however.
Without it, we are a doomed planet.
With it, we can only place ourselves in the hands of the Almighty.
- You just missed the good news.
- I heard it on the PA.
- Here's the full speech. Official release.
- When's the big bang?
Wednesday, 11:00 a.m. They've gotta have their tea break first, you know?
- I don't think that's humourous.
- Don't you? Well, try this for a laugh.
There's five cases of typhus in North
London, and they're expecting more.
- Typhus?
- Yes, from black market water, mostly.
£4 a gallon. Typhus, no extra charge.
- What happened, kid?
- Don't touch him, any of you! Keep away.
- Where does he live?
- Live? I don't know, North London some...
That's what I thought.
Call emergency. Get an ambulance.
I'll get it.
Poor little bastard.
This is all we needed.
You'll have to see your staff's inoculated before anyone leaves.
Of course. At least we have a choice now... Typhus or leukaemia.
What do you think, Bill?
The bombs, I mean.
You heard what the PM said.
No one, not even Bill Maguire can answer that one.
- And if it doesn't work?
- Evacuation by spaceship.
All aboard for the moon. You want the best dead planets, we are them.
- Want a slug?
- Please.
If that's your last will and testament, don't forget to leave me my car.
I'm degutting the polluted water pedlars.
Give us martial law and we'll shoot the gits.
Plus the £12 I paid for my water circulator I haven't even seen.
- Do you want some?
- I'm off it.
So I've noticed. It's a beautiful thing to watch a woman reform a man.
Only needed the Earth to catch fire.
Glad you approve. Well, if you've exhausted your repertoire of amusing quips,
I'll go and collect the other half of the reform movement.
- She's gone.
- Gone?
Yes, she'd collected enough water for a bath, and she was going to have it before you turned it into coffee.
- Can I use the car?
- Surely. I've forgotten how to drive it.
There you are, Jacko.
Read all about it.
Including the carbons.
Slash what you want. I'm going home.
- Home?
- Yes, I've done enough work for one lifetime.
- But you have to be injected.
- Against what?
The end of the world?
Keep moving, please, down to the embankment. The road's closed.
Can I get back on at the other end?
- Not tonight. This district's out of bounds.
- For medical reasons?
No, there's some teenage kids kicking it up a bit.
They lit a few fires, looted a bit of water.
- Where are you going, sir?
- Embankment terrace.
- Okay, let this one through!
- Thanks.
If you see any of them, keep driving.
- They're either drunk or drugged.
- Great party.
And stay clear of Chelsea.
They say it's pretty rough down there.
It always was, wasn't it?
Yee-hoo!
What do you think you're doing?
We're makin' a great clean end, man.
Real cool, clean finish.
I want to throw this lot over on the stinky little cow.
This what you've been saving up for, darlin'?
- Give me that...
- No, I wanna do it!
All right, that's enough!
Now get out!
Pete!
Saving up for a last little bath together, were you?
I wanna bath him! I wanna bath him! I wanna bath him!
I wanna bath him!
I wanna bath him! I wanna bath him!
Did they hurt you?
No, it's nothing. You?
It was time I hit something.
Come on.
I'll go and barricade that door.
- They've all gone insane.
- Yeah, it's the new fashion.
Did you hear the speech?
I heard.
Why did this all have to happen, Pete?
It just had to, that's all.
We're all too smart.
All people want to do is live.
I don't think so.
I wish I could understand why.
A lot of people don't want to live. It's too difficult.
They're tired, they're frightened.
They'd rather it was all over than go on worrying, being frightened, losing a bit more hope every day.
So they want it to finish.
But I don't.
I don't want it to.
Neither do I...
Now.
The time is now 10:41.
19 minutes before countdown.
19 minutes.
The time is now 10:46.
14 minutes before countdown.
14 minutes.
14 minutes before countdown.
You are advised to stay inside.
The time is now 10:47.
The time is now 10:51.
Nine minutes before countdown.
Nine minutes.
The time is now 10:52.
Eight minutes before countdown.
"The boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled..."
Hi, children. They fled to the machine room where the booze is hidden.
But not the deck boy?
He has an assignment. See you.
Where are you going?
To see what happens after the man says, "Zero".
Eyewitness account of whether we're coming or just wind...
- Bill, let me cover it.
- No, Pete.
The time is now 10:56.
Oh, take her home to bed, you idiot.
Four minutes before countdown.
If we can make it to Harry's and down it in three and a half minutes,
I'll buy you both a drink.
I got something, then!
Can't think what you want to listen in for, anyway.
It's a historic occasion, May. It's like the Queen's speech on Christmas Day.
Just a lot of numbers, that's all you'll hear.
Don't see what's historic about someone counting.
All right, open the safe!
What've you got left, May?
Oh, I'm so glad. It's so nice to have someone in the club.
...in exactly 30 seconds from now.
30 seconds.
I've been saving this.
And this one's on the house.
Take it easy now, May.
That half bottle cost a fortune.
How I ever got to be manageress to a mean old bastard like you, I'll never know.
You've never said anything like that before.
No, but I've thought it and now I've said it, and I'm glad. There's yours.
Countdown must have started by now.
Drink up, then.
Here's how.
To the luck of the human race.
Mustn't lose count.
Must be about nine.
Seven...
It's always later than you think.
Six...
- May.
- Five...
- I'm here.
- Four...
- Did you mean all that piffle?
- Three...
- Of course I didn't, you silly old berk.
- Two...
- One...
- Bill, let me.
Zero.
All right, go on, you bloody idiot.
So man has sown the wind and reaped the whirlwind.
Perhaps, in the next few hours, there will be no remembrance of the past and no hope for the future that might have been.
All the works of man will be consumed in the great fire out of which he was created.
But perhaps at the heart of the burning light into which he has thrust his world, there is a heart that cares more for him than he has ever cared for himself.
And if there is a future for man, insensitive as he is, proud and defiant in his pursuit of power, let him resolve to live it lovingly, for he knows well how to do so.
Then he may say once more, truly the light is sweet, and what a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to see the sun.

Well then...
Henry, my brooch!
What for?
- No, not that! Brooch!
- Which one?
- It's on my desk!
- Aha.
Let me do it myself!
Just think! Professor Alfonso himself will be there!
- Alfonso?
Who's that?
- The famous Brazilian!
- Oh, he's here again?
- He's never been here before!
- Rose darling, I'm sure you'll get the Nobel Prize
- Go on...
- No, you'll see...!
- Did you feed the animals?
- Yes.
- Go and fetch Czar.
- Yes. Oh!
Come on then now!
Be a good dog!
Don't get me into trouble again!
Have you shut the cages?
- Yes.
- How's No 3?
- Which one?
- The rabbits that's had an injection yesterday.
- Something wrong with it!
- Why, is it off its feed?
- No, it has such a malignant stare.
- The rabbits are here for my experiments not for my amusement!
Come on, Czar!
Now, go ahead!
Alright. Push!
OK.
...we've welded on a few supports.
It was Zdenek's idea.
Now it can't fall down again!
- Think so?
- Go to it... Be careful!
Start pulling!
- I'm there.
...the supports are a lot stronger than before.
It'll not fall now!
- Look out!!!
Down again!
- I'm throwing in the towel!
We need to come up with something!
You're right there.
Watch out! He's coming!
Hide it, quick!
Well, girls, it's down again...
A coffee, please, Ivanka.
Got a call from the shop.
What's wrong?
- It just dropped again.
- I know! What do you propose now?
- Something to stop it falling.
- Yes, but what?
- Something light, small, powerful...
- And inexpensive!
- Sorry?
- Inexpensive!
- Thank you!
- Just so you know - from this moment on, it's your job and you take full responsibility for it!
Don't waste time, use your head!
Break a leg!
And shut that safe!
You'd better use something else for the larder, girls.
WHO WANTS TO KILL JESSIE?
THE TECHNICAL REVUE
Thank you.
...wants to kill Jessie...
LIKE THAT!
THE MIDNIGHT BEFORE:
I'LL FINISH MY INVENTION TONIGHT!
AT LAST! JESSIE MAKES THE GREATEST
INVENTION OF ALL TIME!
Anti-gravitational gloves...
It's easy for her!
FANTASTIC RESULTS!
NOW FOR A GOOD REST.
AAAH!
POWERFUL FISTS NEED POWERFUL GLOVES!
YOUR END IS NIGH!
TO BE CONTINUED!
Who's is this?
Mine.
From the library.
- Get me the whole serial!
Is everything ready?
All the guests present?
- Yes, Sir.
- Professor Alfonso too?
- Yes.
And I've put a cushion just as you said, under his...
- Yes, yes! Thank you!
Now just relax.
Everything will turn out fine.
Your efforts must bear fruit.
Is the patient ready?
- Yes sir. When I was putting her under the darn cow kicked me.
- There's no need to be rude!
- Sorry, professor.
- Let us go, dear colleagues!
- Nobody missing?
- Dear colleague, right foot first!
Please?
- If you please.
- No, no, no, no, no!
- This is your great day!
- Break a leg!
Ladies and gentlemen!
At the close of our symposium
Doctor Beránková is going to demonstrate the results achieved in her research.
If you please, doctor!
Dear colleagues!
My experiment is meant to demonstrate the possibility of influencing dreams.
The patient chosen for this experiment suffers in her sleep from visions that have an adverse effect on her state of mind.
We can use Wiseman's picture-tube to see the patient's dreams.
Mr. Kolbaba, the blinds!
We see that in her dreams, she's being plagued by gad-flies.
I think that's enough, thank you.
Mr. Kolbaba, lights!
As you can see, an unpleasant nightmare indeed.
No wonder the patient is yielding less milk than before.
And now...
We are going to inject a solution which I have named KR6.
Don't take photographs, please!
It will take effect immediately.
Kindly proceed, dear colleague!
Mr. Kolbaba, the curtain!
And now the results of the dream treatment for our patient.
The preparation is taking effect.
The gad-flies have disappeared.
Tuning, please!
Mr. Kolbaba, light!
The troublesome element in the dream has been removed effectively.
And superseded by reposeful tranquillity.
This phenomenon
I have termed somnioreparation.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Somniology, the science of dreams, has now progressed to where we are able to rid patients of undesirable dreams and replace them with ones beneficial for the dreamer's psychological stability and productivity.
- Thank you. So now to the debate.
So, who has a... Yes!
- I would firstly congratulate my colleague.
Her discovery is of far-reaching importance.
If you consider that we can thus healthily influence the dreams of millions of people
- this will be possible soon - that is, to influence in the socio-political sense.
Yes, it is amazing!
Simply amazing!
- Yes, my preparation may have a salutary effect on the evolution of all mankind!
- Yes, but we are scientists we don't have the right to interfere in people's dreams for whatever doctrine!
- It is exactly because we are are scientists! We have to know what's good or bad for humanity!
- Exactly! Not even dreams can be to develop willy-nilly!
- Pardon. Professor Alfonso. Please.
Can you enlighten me on a small technical detail?
What becomes of the unpleasant dreams?
- Dreams are just mental images which can't materialize or turn into energy.
They simply disappear!
WHO WANTS TO KILL JESSIE?
JESSIE IN HER LAB AGAIN:
I MUST INTENSIFY THEIR POWER...
LATER:
NOW TO SEE WHATWE CAN DO!
Now!
TWO...
THREE! ...AND YOU'RE FLYING AGAIN!
WHO'S FOLLOWING ME?
OH! MY STRAP!
LET'S WRECK THE LAB!
...BUT GIVE IT A ONCE OVER FIRST!
SECRET PASSAGE
WILL JESSIE ESCAPE?
AND WHERE NOW?
TO BE CONTINUED!
Henry! It was wonderful!
A pity you didn't see my success.
Professor Keller has offered me a lecture-tour...
We had a gorgeous dinner afterwards.
Have you eaten yet?
- Yes.
- I could still do with a little...
- What? What would you like?
- Roast chicken!
- Chicken.
Where can I get some chicken now?
- In the fridge.
- We've got some?
- Yes, in the fridge. Wait! Wait!
You must toast my success with me!
- I don't mind if I do...
Rose, here's to your success!
- Oh, Henry darling...
And what have you been doing all day?
- Oh, the usual... Targets...
Planning...
What have you got that's so important, darling?
- Just an idea, Rose dear.
- It won't run away. Bedtime!
- I'd like to finish it.
- What do you mean?
It's Thursday today, isn't it?
Oh yes, sorry... got to sleep...
Are you coming? What's up with you?
What are you doing in here?
It's Thursday!
Aha! Today's Thursday...
Alright.
Henry...!
- Sorry, dear!
What do you want?
TELL US THE SECRET OF THE GLOVES!
I know nothing about it!
I know nothing! What are you doing?
Don't do anything foolish!
No! No! No, wait!
Is it stainless steel at least?
Help!
Help! No! No!
Thank you.
FOLLOW ME!
Alright then! Careful!
Good grief!
Damn! What a weight!
How is it possible?
Miss, those gloves, they have... amazing power!
We could use them in our factory.
You know how they work?
OF COURSE, BUT NO TIME NOW!
- Aha.
But it's...
It's anti-gravitation, isn't it?
PST!
BACK!
What are they trying to do?
What's all this?
Madmen!
They wouldn't dare!
You'll regret this... No!
Leave her alone! Hear me?
You scoundrels!
Villains! Stop, I say!
It's that crazy one again!
What are the candles for?!
What are they...?
Phew!
Hold on, Jessie, hold on!
What are they up to?
A LITTLE SURPRISE!
What surprise?
Wait!
Wake up, Miss Jessie!
Wake up! Hello!
The gloves! We must get them!
I need them desperately!
UNDO THE KNOT!!!!
Aha.
Careful!
Careful, girl, so I don't bite you!
That's it.
Henry! Wake up!
- What?
- Wake up!
- Rosie, where are the gloves?
- What was all that?
Who was that woman?
- Which woman? But, but...
- Yes, the one you bit!
Why did you bite her? And where?
- Rosie...
- You'll wreck our marriage!
- But she's only a child!
- Beast!
- But Rosie, it...
It is not about her but the gloves!
It's the antigravitational gloves!
Miss Jessie has...
- I'll show her!
Off to your bed!
- What are you going to do? Rose...
- Off with you!
- Rose...
- I said scoot!
- Those gloves...
What is it?
- Nothing! It's my preparation.
- What preparation?
- Mine! It's world-famous!
- Rosie, the gloves...
I need these dreams!
- I know what you need!
Get ready!
- No! Your forearm!
There you are.
Why don't you dream about me?
Henry! Time to get up!
Rose, Rosie, are you alright?
Rosie, what's happened?
- Henry... in the bath...
What's in the bath?
What's wrong, Rosie?
YOUR NAME IS HENRY?
Henry!
What's this?
- Oh, just a speech bubble.
- Hurry up!
I saw a man in the bath!
- In the bathroom?
That's a different one!
- He looks pretty angry!
Rosie...
GOOD MORNING!
Oh, Henry...!
Rosie, it's them!
- Which them?
- Well, it's her! From the...
Which her?
- From the... from the magazine.
Wait! Wait!
Oh... she's the...
The one you were dreaming about!
- Of course!
- This is impossible! She has materialized after the injection!
And all those flies...
- What flies?
- We have to lock them in!
- The flies?
- My God! To have such creatures in one's flat...!
Wait, wait!
Not in there!
- My shirts are in there.
- I'm not letting you in there.
- But Rosie!
They are my dreams, aren't they?
- And nothing to be proud of!
Hurry up, I have to go to the Institute.
- I have a lecture and can't show up naked!
- You can buy a shirt somewhere.
Hurry up!
- Why are you always hurrying me?
It's not nearly ten yet!
- I won't leave you alone here.
- Should I open it?
- Don't you dare!
- She may be needing something!
- Don't you worry about such...
Phooey!
So we're leaving the child alone with those ruffians?
- It's not your business!
- Business... business...
I'm surprised at you!
- Let's go!
- I hardly recognize you this morning.
Come on, Czar!
I can't behave like this towards them!
I have a certain obligation.
- What obligation could you have?
Obligation... surely not to that girl!
- Oh, Rosie!
- Good morning!
- Good morning Mrs. Kokeš!
Look, we left that fellow alone in the bathroom.
What if he uses your toothbrush?
- You just want to let them out!
- But they aren't criminals!
And we have no right to...
- No right! Such apparitions have no right to liberty! Come now, Czar!
- Why not?
- Just come along...
THEY'VE IMPRISONED US!
FREEDOM FOR DREAMS!
WHERE ARE THE GLOVES?
I DON'T KNOW!!!
LIAR!!
HELLO!
Kokeš speaking.
I know you can hear me.
What is going on?
Little Paul couldn't sleep all night and now this terrible row!
You're making my wife ill...
And I'm going to be late for work!
We have as much right...
Ex... Ex...
Excuse me.
Vladimir!
Dear colleague, after your demonstration, the operating theatre was full of gad-flies.
We suspect that this was connected to your experiment.
Can you explain it?
- But how could that happen?
- I don't know! But you will have to carry out a test.
At once!
We could try it right now, professor.
Mr. Kolbaba seems to be dreaming.
All right.
- Gentlemen. Over here, professor.
He's dreaming about beer...
Just beer...
Half a vial, please!
This way, professor.
Milk. That will do, I think.
Sorry.
Wow... that's amazing!
- It's terrible!
- Oh yes, of course, terrible!
- The dreams have materialized!
The presence of gad-flies has been explained...
But I want nothing more to do with your preparation!
- Excuse me, professor, but is this actually real beer?
- May I...
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.
- Come on, apply yourself!
- Oh? There we are.
- Good lord, doctor that would be a sinful waste!
I happen to have some experience in this field... just let me...
It's Pilsner, the genuine stuff!
Have a sip, professor!
I will no longer tolerate any such experiments at this institute!
Kolbaba.
- Yes?
Are you feeling alright?
- Yes.
Look. You may drink all this beer as part of our experiment.
- Thank you, doctor.
- But first of all, go to my flat.
Here are the keys.
There you will find some people. Two men and... well, not exactly people.
Take them to the train station and buy them tickets to... somewhere far away.
- Yes, Madam.
- And watch them until they leave.
- Yes.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, of course!
- Here...
- What's this money for?
- For the train tickets!
- Somewhere far away, alright.
- Exactly.
- Think what would happened if someone had some absurd dream and the visions ran amok in the street? A catastrophe!
So that's clear, Ivanka?
You'll give the young lady a coat, she's dressed... of course.
And bring her here.
- Yes.
- Money for a taxi... and the keys.
Buy something for the men to eat, and a few bottles of beer.
Tell them to wait for me.
- OK.
- Helen... please...
- What?
Here's the diagram, test it!
But it has to be flat go it can be put onto a glove.
And don't forget to get the transistors!
Five minutes to ten, darn it...
- Good grief!
- Alright.
- Ivanka, tell them not to make a mess!
- Alright.
...this diagram may in the future become the basis for developing an antigravitational field in which a man might be able to lift the heaviest objects without effort. A Utopia, a dream perhaps.
But we know that human dreams can be very creative, and if we give them wings, we will climb the highest peaks!
SHE'S ESCAPED!
THE SECRET OF THE GLOVES!
What do you think you're doing?
Get down from here at once!
The water's still running!
Switch off the water!
Silence, please!
- Everybody quiet!
- Now, one after the other!
- Hello.
- Hello.
- You've got a leak.
- Yes, OK. Now, what happened?
- They burst through the wall, tore down the phone...
- That's not all! They broke the water pipes and drank all little Paul's milk.
I want you to write this all down.
...they broke my broom and a flower-pot...
Hello.
- Hello.
- Is this Dr. Beránek's flat?
- Yes.
So you're the young lady. Where are the others? You're going on a journey!
- I can't. I've come to fetch the girl.
- Which girl?
- This is for you.
And you are... not to make a mess!
- Oh, thank you.
- That's what the doctor said.
- Well, you're going away, anyway!
Well then.
Where are those men?
Aha!
That'll be them!
You're going on a journey!
Please, let me through!
- Make room here! Stop crowding!
You are under arrest!
- And you're going on a train!
Hey you!
Look out!
- Look out!
No.5 calling! No.5! A woman has just jumped into the sewers.
Almost naked, I say, and then a man jumped after her!
What?
Two, yes. Wait! No! Three!
Yes, that'll be them. What?
Guard the sewers? Yes, sir!
Please sir, what time is it?
DAMNED!!!!
But I can't read, sir!
What on earth are you doing?
Go on then! Run after them!
BURP!
Stop! Come down!
- Get up there, quick!
Your identity card!
After them!
Be quiet, this is a school!
Hello?
I do not maintain that technical fantasy as found in serials and in science fiction should be underestimated.
Of course, they exhibit many negative elements.
- What elements, professor?
- Well, those supermen, for example.
They are simply frightening.
But I would rather call your attention to...
THEY'RE AFTER ME!
Everybody, please! Come down here!
Quickly, everybody over here!
The stronger ones, start barracading the door. Quickly!
Professor, what's the meaning of this?
- Sorry! I'll explain - this young lady is my dream.
- I have no objection to that, but kindly dream off the premises!
LET'S GO!
Stop!
Come back!
It's them! At them, boys! Hooray!
Let go of me!
Sir, I categorically demand that you stop dreaming immediately!
Hang in there, rector!
Yes?
- Pardon.
- You don't think you're going too far?
- No, it's a regular fight!
Sir, we seem to have won.
Handcuffs!
Please consider this incident an internal affair of this Institute.
Shoot him down!
Remember you are on academic ground!
Doctor, in the name of the law,
I am ending your lecture.
Serg... lieuten...
Thank you.
One, two, three...
You say I bit through the water pipe?
Use your head, man, can't you?
Of course I'm angry!
With these teeth?
- So who then?
- Who...
What are you doing here?
- He burst through the wall, bit through a water pipe and stole a child's milk!
- Oh my God, the milk again?
- You've made a pig's ear of it.
Let them go!
- I'm sorry. You can go!
- Yes, but where?
We've already missed the train.
Let's catch the next one!
- I'm not going anywhere.
- How come?
- That must be the young woman.
- Right! Excuse me, I'm Kolbaba.
I have orders from professor Beránková.
Miss, you're coming on a journey.
Why did you want to send those people away?
Firstly, they are not actually people.
Better call them visions.
- But we cannot sue visions for damages!
Or do you think we can?
You are here as an expert in the field of dreams!
- In my opinion, we can't sue them...
But we can sue the dreamers.
I say, Rose... But that... Thank you.
We've known each other for so long...
And you call me a dreamer?
But I only...
- Don't call me Rosie!
You are the defendant.
And if you dreamed about your wife you wouldn't be here.
Silence, please!
Thank you, professor!
But what next?
We have damage done to property, we have Professor Beránek and his dreams.
The court must come to a decision.
WHAT TO DO IN THE SLAMMER
Defendant! What is your relationship with your dreams?
Well... They are my dreams.
You admit you are their owner.
Even if we do not consider the question of whether it is ethical for a person to own another person, the important fact remains that once the defendant had such dreams, he should have taken steps to prevent them becoming a public nuisance.
So I propose: Firstly that he be banned from dangerous dreaming, and secondly that he be condemned for towards his wards.
- I protest!
The defendant's dreams relate to matters beneficial for all mankind!
More precisely, special gloves that use anti-gravity and could result in unheard-of...
- But where are these gloves?
They are still only a dream...
But this young lady can confirm it.
Miss, would you kindly tell us,
I mean produce one of those bubbles to clarify everything?
I LOVE YOU!
Well, there you are.
Turn it so the recorder can see it.
Thank you!
The court will now withdraw for consultation.
The problem of course remains of what to do with those creatures.
Forbid... one can forbid anything.
But to forbid somebody's existence?
- Perhaps the doctor could develop a sort of antidote to send them back into dreams.
- That would take years of scientific research.
- Or just a moment of inspiration, professor!
As the expert, you are undoubtedly in the best position to resolve this.
The court will send them to your institute. Oh, excuse me!
...Pursuant to § 265/1/36 paragraph 12 of the Criminal Law, the defendant
Henry Beránek is sentenced herewith to three days imprisonment.
Defendant, do you accept the sentence?
Yes.
I declare the proceedings to be closed.
I LOVE YOU!
Come along then!
Here are your paper bags.
You're to glue them.
- A pencil, please.
- That's forbidden!
But you can't write on the bags!
- No?
- No.
- So where can I write?
I'm not giving you advice, but people usually do their scrawling here.
- Thank you.
One moment! Please, what happened to the people I dreamed up?
I'll find out.
- Thanks.
Well, we could keep them in cages for observation, like mice.
Observe whom? That woman?
- We don't have big enough cages.
My job is to remove them.
And that is what I will do.
I know what has to be done.
- By removal, you mean...
If we don't hesitate to destroy troublesome insects what's the problem with chimeras?
Mr. Kolbaba!
Yes, doctor.
- Take the three...
I repeat they are not human beings!
...and... do what needs doing...
I think you understand me.
- Not exactly!
Good Lord, you're not serious!
I don't even kill rabbits.
I leave it to my mother-in-law.
I just couldn't...
- You're disappointing me, Kolbaba!
- Well, um...
- I thought you were a real man!
- Me?
- If I were you...
- Excellent! So you do it.
- Oh, but doctor...
- I have spoken,
You're in charge of the operation!
- But...
- Under my personal supervision.
And meanwhile you'll be working on the antidote.
Good grief, what's this?
- I couldn't really explain to you in three days.
- I know! This is mathematics!
Go on writing.
Hope I don't have to pay to get this cleaned up.
What have they done with the girl and those...
- Your wife was put in charge of them.
- This is terrible! Please, call this number.
Ask for Miss Ivanka and dictate her these three numbers.
Oh yes!
Three.
I appreciate the pious atmosphere.
- Yes, we treat them almost as human beings.
- Then, of course, the lady should have precedence.
- I'm not going to retie them!
One by one!
- And the temperature is stable?
- Yep.
- So if you would be so good...
Let's proceed...
Wow! The heat!
Ashes to ashes...
Something's burning here...
Do it properly, it's for your own good.
Look out with that thing!
- Alright...
- Can't you be more careful?
- No talking!
Got to refill it.
Have a good evening!
- See you in the morning!
Enjoy it, lads!
- Cheerio!
- Cheerio!
If you would, doctor.
Death occurred...
- Excuse me!
- Sorry!
The first delusion was removed at exactly 3:40pm.
- Yes. Here?
VERY REFRESHING! HOW MUCH DO I OWE?
The shackles! The shackles have melted!
- Don't just gape! At him!
What a man!
Who here did not admire his true, sporting spirit?
...the preparation A VII seems to be most promising.
- Good.
We have to focus all our energies on the antidote. As our colleague has been so disappointing...
What could I do with that cursed fellow? Damn him!
- Yes, he's some fellow!
- Did you want something, doctor?
There's something of the immortal in him. You can't stand that, can you?
I'd like to tear him...
- Yes.
- Wait a moment!
That's not a bad idea!
Tear him in two!
They couldn't withstand the critical tensile stress!
- In that case, let's start with the girl.
She's more fragile.
- She'll just snap - like this!
- And what will you use to tear them?
Give it to me! Thanks.
See? Here!
Connect it!
Take your time!
Psssst!
Girls - do you have them?
The gloves, I mean!
Aha! How far have you got?
- We need the central computation.
- I've got it here.
Could you stay a little longer this evening?
- But you said...
- Thank you, I knew you would.
I've got a mission for you, Ivanka... espionage.
- Another train journey?
- All right, step back there!
I feel sorry for her!
- Come, come...
- As soon as I wave my handkerchief!
And don't forget - reverse gear!
Good Lord! Everybody can be re-educated, can't they?
What's happened?
- What's the meaning of this?
I was about to give the signal!
- I left my driving licence in my overcoat...
- Just get back in the cab!
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Now try 4.7.
Just the negative circuit!
- All right.
- Four...
- Professor!
- What? Have you found out something?
Doctor...
- Let me go!
- Don't go there!
- Doctor...
Let me at him!
180 bhp.
You see, there we are...
Doctor!
- Will you let me go!
Let me go, Kolbaba, let me go!
- I said I won't!
And I won't!
Doctor, please!
Where are you going?
- He's broken out of jail!
What now!
- Nothing works with him, anyway!
- You're right!
- Did you see him break the chain?
- Untie him!
Hurry up!
- Don't just stand there! Help us!
- Come on, help!
That was a great idea, too!
Steel cables...
- The gloves! The secret of the gloves!
Get them!
THE BEASTS!
Get in! Let's go!
- You're coming with us, too!
Start the engine!
Just a moment!
We must catch our dreams at all costs!
Quicker, quicker!
It is an important social duty.
Step on it!
Damnation!
Get out, quick!
After them! Now they can't get away!
Hey... you! Stop!
Quick!
We're safe here!
If we connect link BX to the primary circuit...
What did you say?
THE SECRET OF THE GLOVES!
After them!
You can rest here.
BUT THIS IS YOUR BED!
Don't worry about that. Just rest.
Make yourself at home.
I have to do my time, they said.
I DON'T BITE, PROFESSOR!
LET ME DO IT MYSELF! NO!
It's Thursday!
NO!!!
Good morning!
ERROR!
Oh, the error!
You've found it!
That's marvellous!
Pardon.
What's this?
I've never seen anything like this!
- No wonder. It's a prototype.
- I see.
- And today is Friday, so I'm done here.
Jessie, let's go!
Look, my darling, I know how to get rid of that girl!
The antidote is ready.
One little prick and she'll be a dream again.
Only a dog's dream this time!
SLOWLY AND CLEARLY!
Like this, darling! One prick...
Careful! You might hurt yourself!
My darling, my Hercules!
HELP!
Oh no! It's starting again!
- Be quiet!
No!
Darling...
I'll follow you!
Good morning!
Look, I need your budget for next month.
Who are these two?
- Ask them!
DREAM WORKERS
NEW WORKERS
If you can tear yourself away from these games, do something useful and take a look at that crane bridge.
Good Lord!
Rose!
Rose!
Rosie!
Oh, has she tied you up?
Such a good doggie?
Could it be?
Darling!
Wait for me!
No, you won't get away from her my boy!
DARLING!
HENRY, TODAY ISN'T THURSDAY!
Get out of here, Czar!
Go onto the balcony, good dog!
DARLING!
You're not a dream any more, Jessie.
You'll have to learn to speak.
Try and say "darling". Like this!
Watch me!
DAR - LING.
Dar...
- Darling!
But you'll only dream about me!
Have you fed the dog?
THE END
NARRATOR:
Berlin, 1944.
 A secret radio message from Adolf Hitler
 personally to his spies in Great Britain.
"Kill General MacKenzie-Smith, please."
 There was terrible headaches, you know.
 Here in London, this is how the message was passed on.
 It's only now that we of
British Military Intelligence
 have been able to piece together fully
from captured German documents.
 We thank Paramount Pictures in Hollywood
 for having the courage to put this on the screen.
 I know we wouldn't.
 The German Secret Service didn't hesitate a moment
 in placing Hitler's orders into effect.
 MacKenzie-Smith was drawing up the plans
 for the Allied invasion of Europe
 and had to be stopped at all costs.
 Here come General Eisenhower,
Field Marshall Montgomery,
 General de Gaulle,
 and Sir Lawrence
MacKenzie-Smith himself
 wearing the familiar eye patch.
MAN:
Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!
NARRATOR:
Dear, dear. We don't seem to be catching up.
 Well, after all, the Germans are in a Rolls Royce
 and our lads only have American Jeeps.
 Not that we're not grateful, mind you.
 Uh, it is better than walking.
Oh, come, come. Let's get those ruddy names off the screen
 Never heard of any of those chaps. Have you?
MAN ( over speaker ):
This camp area is now sealed.
NARRATOR:
That night MacKenzie sealed every military area in Britain.
 Nothing could move in or out.
Not even two American soldiers assigned to a British base.
MAN ( over speaker ):
...permitted to leave this base
 by personal order of the General Officer
MacKenzie-Smith, that so and so.
Boy, you can say that again.
Cheer up, Joe.
So we can't leave for home
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag and smile.
Smile. Smile.
Sure. After all the trouble to get the Red Cross
My poor wife having
My mother isn't desperately ill.
She's on Miami Beach.
She sent me a picture of her in a bathing suit,
My poor sister works for the Red Cross.
Want to get her in trouble?
No, I don't wanna get her in trouble.
How many times have I told you
I'm on the salt-free, fat-free, high-protein low-calorie diet?
What's so difficult about that?
It's not easy to get it on a shingle.
No.
We don't even belong in this teabag outfit.
Well, I know that.
The, the--
Our company was just loaned to the British Army to show them how to open spam or something.
All right.
Why don't we see the captain?
We'll explain the whole situation to him.
He's a nice fellow.
He'll cut some orders for us, and then in a couple of days, we'll be home.
Ernie, this is the army, remember?
There are a couple of boys trying to get home from Gettysburg.
They'll make it.
Inspecting something,
I guess.
Why ain't they out fighting the war?
What do you want?
Why aren't we fighting the war?
Because we want our side to win. That's why.
Sit down, chaps.
We're all in the same leaky boat.
Not us. We're supposed to be sailing on one tonight.
Our sick ones are waiting for us.
This military camp is now sealed by order of the general commanding by order of
His Majesty's government, and by order of the Prime Minister.
Uh-huh.
( imitating MacKenzie ):
Hey! We shall fight them on the beaches. We shall fight them on the streets.
But, uh, how can we fight them if we can't get out of this ruddy camp?
Quiet, will you?
I've gotta think.
Now, there must be somebody we know that's got enough influence to get us out of here tonight.
( in normal voice ):
There's only one man.
( imitates Hitler ):
Sieg heil!
Now he'll run his whole
Luftwaffe for you.
He has a gamut of three.
It's because he was raised in the German section of Brooklyn.
( in English ):
There'll always be an England, but they will be driving Volkswagens.
We will have the--
Ernie, your mustache fell in the potatoes.
It looks right at home.
( in normal voice ):
Yeah, well...
See, without my patch,
I have one good eye with 20/20 vision and one bad eye uh, in case of extreme myopia, you see.
And, uh, I wrote a letter to my draft board about it,
He's jolly good, you know?
The life of the party.
Do an imitation of the boat sailing for the States without us.
( in rough voice):
When the saints go marching in.
Will you quit fooling around?
( normal ):
Honestly, we'll get going.
Of course.
I can just see
MacKenzie Smith, that one-eyed old slave driver giving you permission to go.
Yeah, so can I.
Yeah, here.
( imitates MacKenzie ):
Uh, um, speak up, young man.
Huh, what's his mother doing around in Rip Rolls. What?
Nuh-uh.
Good heavens, man.
Why didn't you speak up sooner?
Oh, yes.
I say unseal Britain, and let my people go.
Don't encourage him, please.
Oh, that's the old bird to a tee. your duty is merely to do your duty.
Do you understand?
Obey orders.
Now yours is not to reason why.
Ours is not to reason why either.
If any stops to reason why, we should all be in Miami Beach with Mother.
Ha, ha, I say, that's a rather witty one.
Well, uh, what?
Carry on.
Come on, chaps.
On the double.
Ernie.
Well, what for?
We're going out to the motor pool.
Grab a car. You'll sit in the back seat and I'll drive you out,
General.
I won't be impersonating an officer.
That's what I mean.
I'll impersonate an officer.
Ernie, it's dark outside.
Don't you see how you fooled that limey captain? wearing all that brass.
I'll make like your chauffeur.
It's a cinch.
You must be out of your mind.
You don't even know how to drive.
The incredible just takes just a little bit longer. and categorically no, no, no.
MAN 1: Hey!
MAN 2:
Who goes there?
Oh, sorry, sir.
I didn't know you were visiting the camp, sir.
But I have strict orders, sir.
Your orders not to let anyone
Quiet, sergeant.
( imitates MacKenzie ):
Um, very good.
But I've just revoked the order, and I am in a bit of a rush.
Open the barrier.
There's a good man.
Sorry, sir, but you must prove your identity.
Blasted man,
I have urgent business at Supreme Headquarters.
I have no time to play
Tin Soldier. Never have.
Now you know who I am.
Open the barrier or I shall have my man drive through it!
Open.
( in normal voice ):
Once we get out of sight,
I'll take the wheel.
I've got to hand it to you.
Maybe it was you who had the IQ of 185.
I guess it was mine.
Listen, you better get out and change that tire before they try to come and help us.
Where do they hide the tools in these things?
I don't even know where they put the motor.
I can't do that.
I'm the general.
So, be democratic.
Oh, stop worrying.
They didn't even notice us.
Hey, I think I found the jack.
Heh, look.
Look, I think I found a fuse.
Oh, what fender.
What to do?
Let me get out of here!
Lift up, so I can put the jack under here.
( screams ):
Yeah, oh, God!
Get this thing up--
We have transport for you, sir. Please get in.
We'll take you to Supreme Headquarters.
I've got a better idea.
Take me to jail.
MAN:
Yes, yes. A remarkable resemblance to the general.
But we must be absolutely certain.
The Nazis,
I'm sorry to say, escaped.
They've slipped through our fingers again, up our sleeve as a last resort.
Finally, we seem to have stumbled on a man who has a chance of carrying it off.
Yes, but yeah, you've seen the report on this fellow?
He's a hypochondriac, a malingerer, a confirmed grouser, he's got flat feet--
But it made a monkey out of the Sergeant Le Garde.
Nonsense. At night, and for a few seconds only.
Colonel.
We're both in intelligence and both understand that could get us committed to a booby hatch
There's something in that.
Now sometimes the long chance is the only chance.
Perhaps you're right.
Well, I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll have this fellow,
Private Williams, brought in tomorrow and leave it to the general to make the final decision.
How's that?
The general himself?
Heh, one thing we've learned from you Americans, my boy, the higher you pass the buck, the longer it takes to come back to you.
NARRATOR:
Our code name for this chap was to be Dead Pigeon.
 Goodness, do you think he heard me?
Okay, Corporal.
We'll take it from here.
Come along.
Sir Lawrence, this is Project 402.
Good heavens.
Oh, please don't judge by his present unprepossessing appearance, sir.
Z-2 has investigated him thoroughly, sir.
This man has an amazing ability for mimicry.
Oh, jolly, we'll have to make sure.
Step forward, man.
Step forward, damn it!
Uh...
Turn around.
Faster!
I can't turn around any faster, sir.
If I turn around fast,
I get dizzy and nauseous and everything, sir.
Yes, sir.
It's like this, sir.
You see, sir.
It's a form allergenic vertigo, sir.
It's, uh, a deviation of the inner ear.
It's quite an interesting problem medically.
I wrote a letter to draft board, explaining the whole thing.
MACKENZIE:
What is this ruddy nonsense?
I say, stop it, you hear.
Halt!
I say there is a vague physical resemblance, but I do say, chaps, don't you think we're going a bit near the knuckle?
Oh, excuse me. MI-5 have also investigated this man, sir.
Tested him thoroughly.
His impersonation of you is skillful even uncanny.
Please don't judge too hastily, sir.
Yes, yes, yes.
Of course.
Mm, uh.
Uh ,what did you say this chap's name was?
Williams.
Private Ernest Williams.
MACKENZIE:
Yes, of course. Uh, you.
Let me hear you play
General MacKenzie-Smith in your uncanny and skillful way.
Would you mind putting out that cigar, sir?
I'm allergic to tobacco.
My sinuses simply are not equipped to handle it, sir.
It's all in that letter, page four, paragraph three.
Look here, man!
I haven't got all day!
General Eisenhower is waiting.
Oh, tell him not to, sir.
I don't do him.
Of all the blithering idiots,
I give you exactly five seconds to comply with my order or I'll ruddy well have you taken out and shot!
Or are you allergic to that too?
( imitates Mackenzie ) :
Of all the blithering idiots,
I give you exactly five seconds to comply with my order or I'll ruddy well have you taken out and shot!
Or are you allergic to that too?
Rather good, me boy.
Rather good.
I say, that's quite a remarkable resemblance.
I'm glad you think so, sir.
Yes, I do.
My congratulations, dear fellow.
Yes, yes.
Quite remarkable.
Blast me if I don't think he'll do.
( in normal voice ):
You're not going to shoot me
Have you been told about your assignment?
Assignment?
We'll take care of that later.
He hasn't been told a thing.
Face the general.
Oh, excuse me,
Sir.
Uh, what will you have?
What?
I'm on a salt-free, fat-free, high-protein, low-calorie, low-cholesterol diet, sir.
Blast it, man!
Anyone who wants to step into my shoes better learn to drink my brandy.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes, sir. I think they let me keep it, sir.
I have it. Oh, uh.
No, that's the Hitler mustache.
I can tell by the mashed potatoes.
( imitates MacKenzie ):
All leaves casual forthwith for the fortnight.
That's the wrong eye, you idiotic nincompoop!
A mistake like that might be tragic.
Well, you see, sir,
I have one good eye and one eye with very poor vision.
When I imitate you, sir,
I always put the patch on the bad eye so I can see.
But if you insist on it, sir,
I can put it on the good eye,
Here, man.
Here's your drink. Drink up.
Sir, I have a liver condition--
There'll be steel through it if you don't.
Alcohol makes the enzymes in my blood have their own--
Be quiet, man, or I'll have you hanged for insubordination!
( stammers ):
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
If that's what you really want.
Sorry, sir.
I, uh, can't see a thing, so I should always wear it on.
Ooh, uh, say, huh...
For heaven's sake, man, drink up and get out of my sight.
Oh, uh, excuse me, sir.
Yes, sir.
Uh, yes.
Take him out and try to persuade him to desert.
Yes, sir.
Come along.
You've got him, Jeff.
MAN:
The enemy expect the invasion here.
Now, at all costs, we must confuse the German high command as to where the blow will really fall.
Already we've sent an actor who resembles
Field Marshal Montgomery on a tour of North Africa to convince the enemy that the attack will be launched from there.
Sound thinking.
Thank you,
Private Williams.
Very kind of you.
Now, General MacKenzie-Smith will shortly take off by air for Yugoslavia where the second front will really begin.
He must travel, of course, in complete secrecy, disguised.
Disguised perhaps as a private in the American army.
Private Ernest Williams.
I see.
And you want me to impersonate the general for a while so that the German high command will believe he is still in London?
Sound thinking.
Uh, thank you, sir.
Very kind of you.
Uh, I've been doing some more sound thinking, sir and, uh, ah, I don't think
I want the job, uh, sir.
ERNIE:
Well, sir, doing it for the fellows is one thing but in real life, day after day uh, heh, I'm not even British.
I honestly don't think
I could carry it off.
In that case, soldier,
I'll arrange for your Court-Martial immediately.
Thank you, sir.
Uh, Court-Martial, sir?
Uh, Court-Martial?
Impersonating an officer is a capital offense.
I think the fellow is quite right.
An American. How could he be convincing as an Englishman?
You did, of course.
When does a colonel listen to a private, sir?
I mean, uh, I've been doing a lot of sound thinking and I don't think there's anybody else
You don't?
Yes, sir.
Uh, certainly on the surface
I may appear American to you but dash it all, underneath, my roots go back to the Pilgrim fathers.
( imitating MacKenzie-Smith ):
You do realize I play cricket every Whitsuntide?
For old Genenid...
I don't know, sir, but I do know I'd like the job.
Under those circumstances,
I'll be happy to see that you get it.
You have nothing to worry about.
We'll give you a complete make up job.
Gray your hair.
We'll put you through a whale of a training program.
You'll study the general's actions, appearance, friends, the whole works.
When we get through, you'll not only look like the general
That may be necessary too.
I can't do that.
You see, Colonel?
I'm on a salt-free, fat-free, high-protein, low-cholesterol low-calorie diet.
We'll cross that alcoholic bridge when we come to it.
Uh, I want you both to know that
I'm very happy to do anything that will make sure that the government of the people by the people and for the people shall not perish from this earth.
Thank you, Honest Abe.
Four score and seven years ago, or forefathers brought forth upon this land a low-calorie, cottage cheese, which is the only--
Don't you think perhaps we ought to tell him?
Tell him what?
That a spy ring of German agents are operating within our own headquarters?
That's already made three attempts on MacKenzie-Smith's life.
It may be wise to risk someone else's life for the generals but--
I don't altogether agree with you Americans, you know? ought to be told the truth and allowed to volunteer.
Colonel, in two years of army service
Private First Class
Ernest Williams has never volunteered for anything including volleyball.
My only regret is he only has but one life to give to his country.
Consider him our rebuttal for Britain.
All right, Jeff, my boy.
You may be right.
Here you are, then.
Heh. To Lend Lease.
Will you be needing the car again this evening, sir?
Uh, no.
That will be all.
You're dismissed, sergeant.
Thank you.
Yes, sir. Uh, the usual tonight,
I assume, sir?
Uh, yes, yes.
Yes, of course.
Very good.
You certainly fooled the general's driver.
Yeah.
How's the contact lens we fitted for you?
I had a little bit of difficulty with it at first, sir, but I see out of it wonderfully now.
Oh, good, good.
I was wondering, sir.
Can I have this contact lens after I finish this job?
Don't quite know how we'd be able to get it away from you.
By the way, have you got the spare lens we gave you?
Yes. Yes.
I have it right here.
Where is it?
Don't lose it.
The general's suite
Yes?
Sergeant Twickenham and his bad manners is waiting.
He's been told everything.
Tomorrow you make your
I do?
Launching the Joint
Allied Red Cross with General Zlinkov of the Red Army.
Don't forget
No, I won't, sir.
Go straight upstairs.
No, I won't.
Good night.
Good night.
I said "evening."
Pretty good, huh.
You should have caught me at the airport.
Ahem! Men, we have an enormous job of work to do. the Allied victories there is nothing in the world that we must value as highly as discipline.
Heh, pretty cute, huh?
The resemblance is absolutely astounding, sir.
But if I might suggest?
Head back.
Not too far, sir.
Uh, slight trace of a limp in the left leg.
Wounded in France.
Oh!
No, sir. Paris.
Lady in a spiked heel.
The general was barefoot at the time.
They told me he was married.
Yes, sir. That too.
Lady Margaret, lovely girl.
She's in Canada, you know, on a war savings bond drive.
That's good. I'll have to remember to keep my shoes on.
You forgot your briefcase, sir.
As usual.
Yes. Thank you.
Uh, yes, uh, quite.
Thank you very much.
Good night. Pip, pip.
Cheerio.
Thank you.
Thank you very much indeed.
You may go back to the motor pool, Sergeant.
Beastly night, though, isn't it, sir?
Double beastly, actually.
Well, good night, sergeant.
Carry on. Press on.
Pip, pip.
Tally ho, and, uh, you may fall out.
What?
What's wrong with you?
Of course, Larry.
You're the general.
Yes, of course.
Quite.
I must investigate this absolutely thoroughly.
I think you'll find everything where it should be.
Good night, sergeant.
Good night, general.
Sergeant!
As usual.
Twickenham!
Comman--!
What's wrong with you tonight, darling?
You're acting a little cold, aren't you?
Cold.
Yes, that's what I have.
A beastly...
You had better leave.
You might catch it.
I know a lovely way to break up a cold, Larry or have you forgotten?
You were very distant towards me in the car tonight, darling.
I, uh, hope you're not holding what happened last Thursday PM against me.
Not at all.
Not a bit.
Not a smidgen.
Not a wit.
No, no.
Not even Wednesday AM.
Wednesday AM?
Larry, you mad fool!
Ah, you haven't change a bit, after all, heh.
Do...
Do you really think she has a cure for the common cold?
I wouldn't doubt it for a moment, sir.
That's what my speech is about tomorrow.
I did try to warn you, sir.
Yeah. Well.
Uh, what am I gonna do?
It would be dangerous to arouse suspicion, sir.
After all, the general has got a reputation with the ladies.
I know that, but I'm on a salt-free, fat-free, high-protein, low-calorie low-cholesterol diet.
You better get me out of here.
Tell her anything.
Tell her something.
Tell her
I've, uh, gone to visit a war.
I'm engaged in a secret conference.
Tell her anything.
I've got to get out.
Oh, no, sir.
I once asked her.
It's Lady Margaret, sir.
The general's wife.
Lady Margaret? You told me she's in Canada on a bond tour.
What kind of a war is this, anyway?
I thought we were fighting the Germans.
Hey, you keep Margaret busy.
I'll get rid of Dr. Cronkite.
Sergeant. Sergeant?
Where are you?
Sergeant?
I say, Sergeant, where are you?
STANHOPE:
In here, Larry.
What? Oh!
Ah.
You impetuous beast.
I'm sorry, your baggage.
My wife, you know.
What am I supposed to do?
Out of the bath, into your clothes,
Hm, the usual.
Larry.
Maggie!
I say it's absolutely wizard to have you back, old girl.
Larry!
I--
Don't I do that to you?
I'm terribly sorry. I was absolutely overcome, you see.
Been ghastly lonely, you know.
Just me and Ike and Monty and Charlie de Gaulle.
Larry, you know I don't find you amusing any longer.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to take a bath
What?
I mean, there's been awful trouble with the plumbing.
I had to pitch in myself, you see.
Do you realize that all the good plumber are in intelligence now?
That, ha, ha...
That's a rather good one.
Rather I'll have it fixed straight away.
Now what, darling?
Oh, you are a bit slower this evening.
Quickly, dear.
On the double.
Oh!
You seem so different.
You've changed.
What's happened to all the passion?
Passion. Poetry.
Yes. Good night.
Good night.
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I say good night till it be morrow.
Oh, Larry!
In dreams
I kiss your hand, madame.
But drink to me only with thine eyes.
I'd be down to get you in a taxi, honey, but you'd better be ready
Yes! Here, dear!
Sorry, I took so long.
I had a bit of difficult, but it's all fixed now.
Eh, dreeded it for.
Uh, drewed it for you.
Difficult language, isn't it?
Oh, capital idea.
Absolutely capital.
Yes.
Uh, I'm a bit fagged out myself.
I think I should turn in myself.
Come over here, Larry.
Come here.
What ever for?
Well, I want to talk to you.
Yes.
How are Toronto Maple Leafs doing this season?
And how is your dear mother?
Gears lock.
Absolutely smashing.
Received a letter only yesterday.
My dear Larry, your mother has been dead for over two years.
Well, the mails are terribly slow these days. and traffic lights and that sort of thing.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Twickenham!
Twickenham!
Your Ladyship.
You'll excuse my forwardness but
I took the liberty of calling
MI-5 military intelligence.
Colonel Somerset's on the line he'll explain everything to you.
Well, I certainly hope so.
Don't let him out of your sight.
I guess
I didn't fool her at all.
Don't worry, sir.
The general never does either.
Larry's where?
Yes, I did return unexpectedly.
Project 402?
Dead Pigeon?
What is this soldier supposed to do?
Now, Colonel Somerset, are you serious?
Does he know this?
He should be told.
Well ,yes, Colonel, if you say it's top secret, not a word.
Poor unfortunate fool.
Uh, her Ladyship.
Ah, sorry, sir.
She'll expect this.
That will be all,
Twickenham.
Ah, yes, my lady.
I'm sorry about all this. or I was supposed to try to convince you I was Larry or--
Oh.
You may put your hands down.
Oh, thank you.
I, uh, wouldn't like to cause any embarrassment.
I could sleep outside on the couch or something.
No, heh, we'll play the game to the hilt.
You sleep in Larry's bed.
He seldom used it anyway.
I still have the gun, soldier.
I hope you'll forgive my being a bit shaky, but, uh,
I mean
I've met a lady, but
I had a peculiar idea that you'd be wearing a crown or coronet or a halo.
Something like that.
Oh, I haven't worn a halo in years.
You could have fooled me.
Lady Margaret, I'm curious about something.
Did I play the part well enough to fool you?
I wouldn't mean permanently, but momentarily when we first met.
Oh, that's when you made your first mistake.
Because Larry hasn't kissed me hello in ages.
He hasn't? he never bothered to hide them from me.
That might be an expression of an inferiority complex.
It could mean that he loves you very much.
I wish I could be as forgiving as that but I came back from Canada to ask Larry to give me a divorce.
War hero or no.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Maybe all he needs is to go and see a psychoanalyst.
I once had an uncle who hated my aunt.
He went to see an analyst every day for six months at $25 a visit.
He learned to love her all over again.
Then he ran out of money, so she divorced him.
I don't know why I'm telling you all this, except that it has absolutely nothing to do with your situation at all.
If you're supposed to have fooled Larry's friends and I presume you are, you've got an awful lot to learn.
You have?
Yes. I've been down to the headquarters, and they've been showing newsreels of him and I've been reading biographies and I've been practicing too.
Yes.
Limping and swagger-sticking.
I ever put a mark on my eye where the patch is supposed to go over, heh.
Larry doesn't need any patch any more than you do.
He doesn't?
It's just that one eye has a tendency to become quite bloodshot after five or six brandies, his usual condition.
I don't like officers like that
They think they're winning the war.
You're winning the war,
Private Williams.
No, not me.
I'm not doing anything much.
I'll be finished in a few days.
I think you'd better get some sleep
Yeah.
Uh, good night,
Your Ladyship.
Good night,
Project 402.
NARRATOR:
Our man from Brooklyn remained a perfect gentleman all night.
( suspenseful theme playing )
What'd I say?
Ah, you said, "My old friend, Marshall Zlinkov.
It's been a long time since those gay old days in Moscow."
Yes, I've got that phrase down pretty pat, but suppose the general asks me something else in Russian.
I can't keep telling him about the gay old days in Moscow.
I shall be on the platform with you, and I shall tap you when you must answer.
Once for nyet, meaning no.
Twice for da, meaning--
Three times for mozhet byt, meaning yes.
We're getting close to the area.
Once for nyet, meaning da.
Once for da. Two nyets for mozhet, meaning--
Here, here. How about a spot of brandy for the nerves?
No, thank you. I don't.
You don't happen to have any yogurt in there?
Yeah.
None.
You better have the brandy yourself. Ah, twice for yeah.
I get out of the car and everybody cheers.
I step on the platform.
Everybody cheers.
I deliver the speech.
Everybody cheers.
I get back in the car, and they go out of their minds, cheering, heh.
We're here.
Ah, Twig, we're here.
Ah, Twickenham.
It's no time to fall asleep.
I've got to remember the nyets and the--
Twickenham!
Twickenham, say something.
Take him out.
Hurry, they're cheering you.
What's the matter?
Yes, yes.
Poor Twickenham.
High blood pressure.
And a touch of malaria.
Malaria, I believe.
But he had such a good complexion.
But he also had cirrhosis of the liver and a weak heart.
Cirrhosis.
You never know who's gonna go next, do you?
Sometimes you do.
You take care of him.
Go on. They're waiting.
Good luck.
Uh, maybe if he'd been on a fat-free--
I don't think that would have helped.
Look, I can't go out there.
Look at that crowd.
You've got to.
You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time.
But the first fellow who said that was shot.
MAN ( over PA ):
May I welcome you on behalf of the United States Army.
 Also on behalf of our distinguished visitors,
 Marshall Gregory Zlinkov of the Army of the Soviet Union,
 General Sir Lawrence
MacKenzie-Smith
 of the British General Staff.
We gather here on the eve of the invasion.
You men will spearhead the attack and rest assured in the knowledge that today as we launch a new drive for the plasma that will bring to the floor--
Tovarish, doctor.
General MacKenzie-Smith, you speak the marshal's language.
Would you explain to your old friend
We're not taking any blood samples.
I believe he said this reminds him of the gay old days in Moscow.
I say, what are they doing there?
Da.
MAN:
Hero.
Carry on.
Men, we have further good news.
After intensive research, the medical corps of the United States Army is passing along to its allies
Those two enemies of seaborne landings mild burn exposure have finally been conquered.
One shot of serum D-104, and seasickness becomes an old wives' tale.
We have also developed S-604, a new anti-influenza vaccine.
Gentlemen, never has the army had two such distinguished guinea pigs.
Not at all.
Ready? Oh, yes.
Uh, pardon me.
Ah, no, sir.
These are in the arm.
Oh, terribly sorry.
I say, do be gentle.
Thank you.
Uh...
Molodets, heh.
Men of the invasion forces, the hero of Dunkirk,
El Alamein and Tobruk,
General Sir Lawrence
MacKenzie-Smith.
As you are, men.
Men... no longer the discomfort of seasickness.
As you men are the spearhead of the invasion disembarked from your landing craft, you will be so healthy and so fit that your condition will come as a complete surprise to the German army.
And so I say to our gallant allies, hip, hip.
Achoo! Pardon.
Let me hip, hip, achoo.
I'm afraid
I'm not much of a cook, but this is the best
I could do without Twickenham.
Twickenham.
That was the fastest case of cirrhosis I've ever seen in my whole life.
What about that stray bullet that knocked my hat off?
Boy, that was really close.
You'd better eat properly.
I'm supposed to ride through
Trafalgar Square in an open car.
They want me to sit up on the back so that the people can see me when they cheer.
I'm a symbol, you know.
You're a target.
A target.
A sitting duck.
Do you know what the code name for you is?
German Secret Service has been trying to kill my husband and you've been set up to take his place.
No, no. He's going to Yugoslavia to open a second front.
All the English troops are going to Yugoslavia because he said that when he went to Yugoslavia, all the troops would be able to be able to attack behind the Danube.
Dead Pigeon?
Do you know why we're giving that party tonight for the officers of
Larry's old regiment?
No. You mean the MacKenzie
First Highlanders? No.
They've learned that the chief agent
And tonight, they've invited everyone they suspect of wanting to kill you.
I'm sorry. I'm getting out of here right now.
I'm turning in my eye patch, sir. And my mustache.
I figured out your whole cold-blooded scheme.
Pretty clever, wasn't it?
If they don't get me at the party, at Trafalgar Square.
You can have your pips back.
I'd rather be a private in the front lines under fire from shot and shell, sir.
Don't take that literally, too, sir.
I'm sorry, Colonel Somerset.
I suppose I've broken security but I couldn't let you do it to him.
That's all right.
I understand how you feel, of course but it's a matter of military necessity.
But there's been a change in the situation.
Why? Are they switching to knives?
No.
I'm sorry to have to break this news to you, under these circumstances.
What's wrong,
Colonel Somerset?
The aircraft that was taking
General MacKenzie-Smith supposedly to Yugoslavia was in point of fact headed for invasion headquarters in Kent.
He was going a roundabout route to confuse the enemy.
It was, I regret to say,
Everybody lost, including
I'm afraid, your husband.
You have my very deepest sympathy, Lady Margaret.
Are you all right?
Yes, thank you.
I'm all right.
It's strange that at a time like this you only remember the good moments.
So you understand our strategy has completely changed.
The sad death of
General MacKenzie Smith will delay the second front for weeks.
You must be at the party tonight for the general's old regiment.
Even though you think somebody at the party is going to try to knock me off?
We're sure of it, but this will make the whole thing work.
When they expose themselves, that will give us opportunity of breaking the spy ring.
I see. Before or after they try to kill me?
Oh, before, naturally, heh.
We hope.
Oh, look, sir.
I like to go to parties, but I'd like to go home afterwards.
Under the circumstances,
Williams, the decision must be yours.
This is not an order.
Oh. well, in that case--
But you must realize thousands of Allied lives may depend upon you.
We have no right to ask you to commit what might be suicide.
Well, in that case--
But the whole of the
United States Army is at stake.
Williams, what do you say?
Help!
Don't forget for a moment that you're in danger.
Be careful.
Heh.
Don't trust anyone.
Um, ahem.
Remember, if you want to convince them you're really Larry.
Fine.
How's it going, vicar?
At the end of the evening you'll get boring drunk.
And you and I must have a large family brawl.
How do you do?
We may even strike each other.
You must try.
How do you do?
Mm-hm?
If anything happens to me tonight,
I want you to know these have been nicest two days
I've ever had in my whole life.
Mm-hm.
MAN: And there he was
General Biff Browningham with only one chukka to play.
And I.
Pardon me.
Excuse me. Who's the gentleman that just arrived in?
Oh.
He was in the
MacKenzie Highlanders.
Just an acquaintance of Larry's -Mm-hm.
Been in the Middle East.
Hmm.
Well, that's good because
I couldn't stand all details.
MAN:
A drink, your ladyship?
No, thank you.
Um, look here, sergeant.
WOMAN: That's General
Brown Wiffingham.
Commanding South Hampton
Staging Area.
Oh, yes. I recognize him from the regimental photo.
Uh, we're supposed to be very good chaps.
And he calls me, oh, um, he calls me Binky, and I call him Puffy.
Puffy.
It's kind of nauseating.
Isn't it?
Well, you're very fond of him.
But you're not crazy about him.
Oh.
Binky, heh!
Hello, Penelope.
How are all the children?
Didn't you get my letter from New Delhi?
Oh, yes.
That was too bad.
What is too bad?
I mean,
I was absolutely overjoyed.
About what?
Em, eh, I save stamps, you know.
You can have you head blown off and still say something witty.
Have your head blown off?
Oh.
Good evening.
It's a pleasure,
Lady Margaret.
I don't think you or the general know my wife.
How do you do?
Head blown off.
We intercepted a radio message.
They've changed their plan.
I don't know what they're trying now.
No, no, no, no.
Uh, I'm following it up.
Nothing could possibly happen.
Oh.
I know everything about everybody.
Oh, my dear.
Now, what can we do for you, eh?
What would you like?
Oh, the usual.
WOMAN: Good heavens.
Lady Vivian.
I was hoping she wouldn't find out about the party.
She'll ruin everything.
Come on. Let's meet her.
Yes.
Yes?
What have you got to say for yourself?
Head blown off.
Oh, Aunt Vivian,
I'm so sorry.
Larry's favorite aunt and I forgot to invite you.
Yes. A complete oversight, but my apologies, dear auntie.
Auntie?
You've never referred to me as auntie.
I didn't?
Old Iron Drawers was the kindest word
Yes. Iron Drawers.
I know this was a deliberate slight.
It wasn't at all,
Auntie Drawers.
I mean the Larry, what's wrong with you?
Wrong with me? There's nothing wrong at all.
You know when I walk into a room your eye always twitches.
You see there I finally managed to over come it.
I don't twitch at all now that.
There's something strange about you.
I can't quite put my finger on it.
Well, you see,
Iron Drawers, I mean auntie,
I'm not quite myself tonight.
Oh, I have noticed improvement.
( stammering ):
Yes. I, uh, um...
A drink?
Well, I can't have.
Where's the bar?
What's wrong?
My contact lens.
She knocked it out.
No. Who are you?
Head blown off.
Must have gone under the table. -Everybody's looking.
Drop your earrings so we can go after it.
My goodness. I lost my hearing. -Oh, you clumsy fool.
You've dropped your earring?
Oh, where's the table?
Left rudder, you fool.
Pss. Pss. Pss.
Puss, come on.
Give me that lens.
I'll buy you a monocle.
Would you gimme. Gimme.
Pss. Pss. Pss. Pss.
What are you?
A German spy?
There you are.
Did you find it?
Where's the other contact lens?
But wait a minute.
There's a car in the street blinking its light and I think it's a signal of some kind.
Don't worry. I'll see to it.
Go and get the lens first.
You join the others.
Yes. I will.
Oh, good heavens. The cat.
Ooh.
No.
Where have you been all this time?
I have your drink ready.
No, but I'm not thirsty actually.
Yes.
A toast?
Eh, to the king.
ALL:
To the king. God bless him.
I shall be going back there then.
Come back.
God bless him.
I've forgotten, sir.
Eh, favorite what?
Why Captain Patterson, everyone knows Sir Lawrence only smokes these.
Eh.
Binky, you always had the finest taste in cigars and women.
Another toast.
To the, uh, regiment.
No.
To the regiment.
You have to sing something.
Okay.
The regimental song,
Larry.
Don't you remember it, sir?
Of course I do.
Yes. He always leads us into it.
Come on, love.
♪ Drink a toast ♪
A toast, Larry.
To the regiment!
ALL:
To the regiment!
To the regiment.
ALL:
To the regiment!
I tell you.
I think he's marvelous.
Yes. Isn't he?
Gracious heaven.
Larry! Larry!
( woman speaking indistinctly )
Stop, Larry! Stop!
You're making a travesty of the regiment.
And of our native land.
One thing you never made fun of,
Larry, was Scotland.
Well, look at me.
What?
There's something strange going on.
WOMAN:
Do you know what I think?
I think you're not even--
Not even sober.
Larry. How can you disgrace me like this?
Night after night?
Look here old girl.
I've had about enough of this.
I'll drink how I want,
Oh!
You sober fish wife.
No, I.
How dare you do that to me!
( crowd speaking indistinctly )
Ooh, that's our Larry, all right.
One thing Scotland knows how to make and that's whiskey. and you missed me and you hit Lady Vivian.
No, I was cheating.
I could see a little.
Heh, and what was the last thing I hit you with?
( in low voice):
The cat.
Yes.
Uh, is your eye all right?
Oh, no.
No, it's quite all right.
Just like old times.
Em, do you know that song I coughed tonight?
Yes.
It, eh, it's very much like a song we used to sing in the 4h grade.
Well, that's quite possible.
Many of these old Scottish heroes were used over the years with different person.
How did it go back in the 4th grade?
I wonder
If I can remember it.
♪ When the fine mist of
Scotland ♪

Well, it was all right before,
I don't think I should sleep in this room.
That doesn't make any sense at all.
It's not supposed to.
MacKenzie Smith here.
Oh, hello,
Colonel Somerset.
Well, that's wonderful.
Fine.
Good work. Yeah.
Well, I think they've got their man.
Tomorrow at this time, they think I'll be able to back to being
Private Ernie Williams again.
Just a minute.
Will you tell me something?
Do you want to go back to being Private Ernie Williams?
You can get used to almost anything.
Sorry. Go find a louse.
Yes. the entire show magnificently. would ever have been.
No, no, no, no.
I'm not as brave as Larry
I'd be brave enough to do what I really want to do.
And what do you really want to do?
But I'm too much of a coward to do that.
This.
ERNIE:
Who is it?
Sergeant Stanhope, sir.
An urgent message from Major Houston.
Ernie.
The eye patch.
The moustache.
Thank you, sergeant.
Hmm.
Ordered to headquarters immediately.
The car's waiting down below with the major, sir.
I'll be down directly.
Thank you, sergeant. Press on.
Well, I guess they got him. and the general's eye patch and the general's wife.
Well, for taking advantage of the situation just now.
I, uh, I guess we both had a little too much to drink.
Oh, uh, would you do me a great favor?
Of course.
Well, after the war, if you ever get to Brooklyn,
Yes?
Don't look me up.
Nobody'll ever believe it.
I say, this is silly bother, scurrying about at night like a ruddy obstetrician.
I'll wager there's no emergency at all.
Would you care to risk a fiver?
Three sheets of the wind, eh?
Aw, what you need, young man, is some, uh, tomato juice, raw egg,
Worcestershire sauce and...
Head blown off.
I say, the Major is dead.
Uh, would you stop...
The Major...
I say. Would you...
Uh, the Major is quite dead, you know.
I say. Would you stop...
Uh, look, the man...
Well, here, please.
You're out of uniform.
Uh, um...
The Major is quite...
Say something.
Say something else.
Don't attempt to escape or the Major will have company. but not quite clever enough.
You'll never get away with this.
I say, Stanhope, turn the car around.
Not tonight, General.
But if you turn the car around,
I'd promise you the usual.
I hated every minute of it.
Good show there.
NARRATOR:
I never suspected her for a moment. This is terrible.
Welcome to Berlin,
General MacKenzie Smith.
You are now the guest of the Third Reich.
Now, all we wish is a little information.
And we shall see that you are given a charming house in the country, servants, wine, frauleins.
Whatever you may wish.
And you will be able to sit out the rest of the war in complete comfort.
All we ask is that you tell us the truth.
MAN: Precisely.
You see, uh,
I'm an American soldier and my name is Private First
Class Ernie Williams, serial number, uh, 347236.
And I was supposed to go back to America because my mother is very sick.
Only she isn't very sick.
She's in Miami Beach with a bathing--
Oh! Oh!
What happened to the house in the country?
My dear General, you have a reputation for playing games.
We have not.
Unless you answer our questions honestly and quickly, we will have no alterative but to order you shot.
Oh!
MAN;
And we are waiting to hear it.
You see this eye patch?
MAN:
Oh. General.
And, uh, look at that moustache.
Oh. What ha...
Ugh. Must be the glue.
It got stuck in the sea air.
You see I haven't had it off for a few days.
Forget it . It's mine.
But you simply have to believe how it all got started.
You see, I was doing imitations for a couple of the fellas.
And uh, heh, I do imitations, you see.
Well, look. Maybe I can explain it to you better.
We survive them on the beaches.
We survive them in the villages.
We will never surrender.
Uh, I got a better one.
Oh, when the saints--
Ahem. Well, maybe this one will do it.
I got a real good one here.
We have, hmm...
ALL:
Heil Hitler!
Oh. Well, I...
Heh, nobody seems to like that one.
MAN:
General MacKenzie Smith.
Perhaps you do not understand us.
You have vital information on the timing and location of the second front.
I have?
But because of your respect for you,
I do not with to see you reduced to a shattered hulk of a man.
MAN:
Are you trying to make us believe
That's right. It was all a phony and you fellas fell for it.
You see this grey stuff they put in my hair?
It washes out with soap and water.
Look. I'll show you.
I told them it was no good.
I have to touch it up every night.
Even in the rain it comes out.
Here. I'll show you.
Maybe they used a new brand
It...
Oh, it's me.
I've turned white.
See you've done it.
Poisoning Twickenham and that shot through my head and, uh, the submarine.
Oh, if you fellas only knew what I've been through.
Oh, you do know.
Don't you?
It is only the beginning my dear, General.
Take him away.
Throw him in a cell.
Use the usual methods.
Not the usual.
MAN:
One more thing.
Our operatives in England are everywhere.
You understand?
Everywhere.
And they are led by a man so highly placed
British intelligence would never suspect.
It is not only your life that is in jeopardy.
But that of your wife.
Lady Margaret.
Heil Hitler.
You'll never get away...
NARRATOR:
The news spread through
 the German high command like wildfire.
 MacKenzie Smith had broken down
 and agreed to talk
 after being tortured continuously
 for three solid minutes.
MAN:
Good evening here, General.
Let us get this filthy business over with.
MAN:
This is a great moment for the Third Reich.
We have broken
MacKenzie Smith.
Heh, this will please the Fuehrer immensely.
I presume, gentlemen, he will go into his dance again.
Be careful, general.
May I remind you once more.
We have many operatives in England. Many of them.
The one who leads them is a very good friend of your family.
And of your wife.
It doesn't matter.
She will be safe enough.
If you talk.
Now, here, General.
We have here a most interesting map.
England, German, France.
All military objectives carefully indicated.
You shall be the professor and we will be your willing students.
The time, the location and the strength of the allied invasion.
Gentlemen, when I finish you will know as much about this blasted invasion as I do.
Perhaps even more.
Sorry. I was carried away, old chap.
Uh, bit of tear in the eye and that sort of thing.
I say, it's a bit of a blur to realize
ERNIE: Righto.
Well, a concentration of troops in Southern England actually is a ruse, you see.
Uh, we shall do the main attack in the soft underbelly of Monte Carlo, right here.
You see. I say.
Surprise, eh?
Caught you on a sticky wicket. What?
Well, you see actually, um, mm, right here is where we're going to a small attack of naval vessels.
The LCTs, the BBDs, the LSMFTs, the IRT and the CIO and the, uh, SMFR are our IUT.
What artillery? What infantry?
Who are their commanders?
What are their immediate objectives?
Okay.
Write this down over there.
I shall tell you in a minute.
You see, Captain, Brigadier
General, Father Ingrad,
( gibbering ): the Argyle Highlanders, have taken the largest one of the troops as a haven for...
And of course, there's...
Tech here, which, hmm, of course will terminate at the edge or tip.
And here, regarding the subways, they will have a remarkable incentive, and, of course, the troops are all employed and all the frontal assault which have nothing...
I suppose they...
Busy...
Than bottom, you see.
What have I done to England?
I simply can't go on.
Control yourself, General.
You are a military man as we are.
We didn't understand a word.
It doesn't matter.
Above all the signal.
Which signal do you mean?
Do not pretend, General.
Counter intelligence has told us a signal is to be broadcast over the BBC two days before D Day.
A meaningless phrase.
To the French underground to announce the date of the invasion.
I'll be down to get you in a taxi, honey.
And the hour.
The hour of the attack?
You'd better be ready about half past eight.
We'll be ready.
I wish I could be there when the band starts playing.
But you won't.
If I had a gun,
I would shoot myself.
It's the only decent way left.
 Einen moment.
 Einen moment.
( people speaking indistinctly )
( people speaking indistinctly )
( all speaking in German )
Goodbye.
( audience applauding and cheering )
( audience applauding and cheering )
NARRATOR:
The German notes on this point were somewhat fragmentary.
 But bear in mind that Sigmund
Freud came from this country.
MAN:
Fraulein Lilly.
Oh!
I have to start the machine.
ERNIE ( speaking in English ):
Stop! Stop! Let me outta here.
Just in time.
Don't shoot. Oh.
( Ernie speaking indistinctly )
Sir, we've captured a German paratrooper attempting to infiltrate this headquarters.
He's demanded the right to see the commanding officer personally.
MAN:
Very well. Bring him in.
Bring in the prisoner.
Heh, Puffy!
Puffy, am I glad to see you.
All right.
I'll talk to the prisoner.
Prisoner? Puffy, don't you know me? I'm Binky.
ERNIE: I'm not really Binky.
Ernie. Yes. Private First Class
Ernie Williams.
Heh, I fooled you.
I fooled the Germans.
Heh, call Somerset.
He'll tell you.
Wilson. This seems to be a top secret matter.
I'd like to get to the bottom of this alone.
Dismissed.
Oh, Puffy, if you know what I've been through.
I've been in submarines, airplanes. I've been in Berlin.
I've even been at the Gestapo headquarters.
Know what I did?
I stole some of the papers out of the secret files naming all the agents in England.
People you would never suspect.
I've got them right here.
General Carleton Brown
Wiffingham. Sergeant, er...
General Carleton Brown...
Yes, my dear
Private Williams.
If that is who you are!
You'll never get away with this, Puffy.
Um, hello?
Open up, please, sentry.
Urgent.
I'm sorry, sir. You can't enter this headquarters.
Colonel Somerset is general staff.
He has my identification.
I'm sorry, sir.
Where's the Sergeant of the Guards?
This is a matter of life and death, Sergeant.
Open up, please.
Sorry, sir.
All entry permits have been cancelled for the day.
Orders of
General Brown Wiffingham.
We've had
General Brown Wiffingham under surveillance for weeks.
Wilson!
Hold that man.
The whole project, the Dead Pigeon.
Or I will be.
Yeah, hello?
This German paratrooper is masquerading as an allied soldier.
Under the king's rules and regulations he is guilty of espionage and subject to immediate execution.
CARLETON:
Wilson, the penalty for insubordination is still the same. Take that spy out and have him shot.
Shot? Uh...
But Puffy, you and I played
Rukka together for Scotland.
Ah, the MacKenzie Smith
Highlanders.
WILSON:
Firing squad is ready, sir.
Dismissed.
No. Not you.
Maybe she's forgotten who I am.
You will tell her, won't you?
I mean you'll tell her that
I wasn't scared at all.
I'll get word to Lady Margaret.
Cigarette?
No. No, thank you.
But I don't think one could hurt me.
Match?
That won't be necessary.
Prepare to aim!
Squad ready!
Aim!
Just a minute. I think I will have that blind fold.
WILSON:
Squad rest. Rest. Rest!
Uh, not too tight.
I get dizzy. See?
Squad ready! Aim!
MAN ( over radio ):
It is only fitting
 that Britain today should do honor
 to the valiant heroes
 who have made this day possible.
 are already familiar to you.
 General Eisenhower forthwith...
Good afternoon,
Lay Margaret.
Lovely day for England.
Huh? Thank you, madam.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I couldn't tell you before.
Security reasons.
Anyhow we dashed down to the South Hampton staging area hoping to get there on time.
By jove, that's a pretty dress you've got on.
Never mind about the dress.
We were held up at the gate.
The firing party had raised their rifles.
I heard the command,
Yes?
Good Lord.
I'd love a cup of tea.
Oh, yes. Oh, tea.
Yes.
And what then?
Um, some milk and sugar if I may, please.
Private Williams.
Oh, yes.
Yeah. He's absolutely fine.
We only got there in the nick of time.
It was a bit of a do.
Where is he?
When can I see him?
How many lumps you put in here?
He can see you any time.
He's at the base hospital.
Not much matter with him.
Just shock and fatigue and the after effects of smoking.
( man speaking indistinctly over radio )
Wonder if you'd mind if I turned up your radio.
MAN ( over radio ):
General Sir Lawrence
MacKenzie Smith.
The architect of the invasion.
 The master planner
 whom we had believed killed
 in performance of his duties,
 actually survived
 and was taken prisoner by the Nazis.
 I rejoice along with all of England
 that he was liberated in the first among...
MARGARET:
Larry.
We've just heard the news that--
Yes. I know.
Do try to control your joyous hysteria at my return from the grave, Maggie.
I know how pleased you are to see me.
Oh, sir, Lawrence, you can't even begin to realize--
Oh, come off it,
Somerset.
You were just as pleased to see me
Oh, no, please, please.
Lawrence.
Will you get out of here!
I have a few matters of a very intimate nature to discuss with my dearly beloved.
You may listen at the keyhole.
If you'll pardon me,
I'm going over to the enemy.
Heil Hitler!
I see you haven't lost your charming ways with your subordinates.
I hear you haven't either, my dear.
What's this I hear about you and that American private?
It's all true.
Oh, come now.
A penniless common soldier.
A complete nonentity.
I've had my fill of entities.
Next thing you'll be saying you're in love with the blighter.
I am in love with the blighter.
Heh.
How did you manage?
I mean, how...
Well, look, you see.
They wanted to give me a medal, but all I asked for was a smart technician from the Signal Corp with a recorder and a microphone.
That's why you heard what you did on the radio.
General Lawrence
McKenzie Smith, the architect of the invasion, the master planner.
Did you mean it?
And I had you fooled every minute.
Every minute.
NARRATOR:
For those of you who are curious
 it's just the usual.
Gentlemen? Gentlemen, it's quite true.
The weather continues to defy nature.
Overnight the temperatureat the Arctic has risen 4.9°F.
Gentlemen! Another five degrees...
...and Haifa Harbour is completely under water!
It's true. New York, San
Francisco, NewOrleans,
Marseilles - every port's in danger.
Who is doing this? And why?
- It's the work of madmen.
Mad, sane...
They're brilliant.
They're demonstrating thatthey can control the weather!
Turn wheat belts into deserts, put icebergs in the Mediterranean.
Control the weather, you control the world. - What do they want?
Why haven't they contacted us? - Oh, they will.
But we're not going to wait for them. We've just had our first break.
According to this dispatch I just received, our team of agents has them cornered!
At any second...
It was a trap.
We just lost another team of agents.
They know every move we make! - They have a superb intelligence unit.
How can I find that laboratoryif
I keep losing manpower?
How about 0008? - Unfortunately he is not available.
International narcotics. -
Please. We can't use 0008.
They have a file on all our personnel. Wehave...
...to recruit from outside the organisation.
Well, ifyou'll write down the qualificationsyou believe necessary for the assignment, our computer'll give us the ideal man.
Stand by computers.
Derek Flint! My country awarded himthe Croix de Guerre!
Flint's wrong for this job. - Wasn't he under your command in the war?
Forget it. He can't take orders. - Derek
Flint! Three promotions in a month!
And our Medal of Honor. - I said forget it!
Excellent chap, expert frogman. Name's Derek Flint.
We need a man who can follow regulations!
We need a man who's disciplined!
Flint.
I don't care what these computers say. I know this man. He just...
Yes, sir?
Yeah? Well, uh...
Well, how did you know, sir?
Very well, sir.
Yes, sir. Well, of course, that's your privilege, sir.
Well, ifthat's your wish.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Very good, sir.
Very well, gentlemen, uh... Derek Flint.
Mr Cramden wants...
Mr Flint? General Hawkins.
Mr Cramden wants...
What do you mean, he said no? I sent you...
Yes, sir?
But I sent General Hawkins himself, sir.
Yes, sir. I'll contact Flint personally.
Yes, sir. It'll be a pleasure, sir.
Sir?
Flint...
Lower your hand slowly and smile.
What? - If he senses hostility, he'll rip you apart.
Smile, sir.
Thank you, Caesar.
Well, sir, this is a surprise.
Let me take your hat and coat.
Perhaps nudes aren't your dish oftea.
Have a cigar, sir.
No, thank you.
Breakfast, sir?
I had lunch two hours ago. - Oh,
I must still be on Moscow time.
Moscow? Business? - No. Ballet, sir.
You travelled to Moscow to watch a ballet? - No, to teach.
Do you mind ifwe talk while I shave? - After you.
Flint, I'm here because...-
You want something.
Don't be clever. I came here on orders. - Bonjour, cheri.
Bonjour, baby.
Maybe my office is a better place to talk...- I doubt it, sir.
Well, once you realise the importanceofthis project, I know you'll be interested...
You know the high regard I havefor you and your organisation.
Thank you. - But I think your file on me needs updating.
You see, as of late my interestsare less governmental than personal.
All right for today?
Excellent, carissima.
Later.
Now, Flint, in the pastyou and
I have had our differences of...
Well, discipline is a vital factor...
...that every citizen has got...
Don't wave the flag in the bathroom. Just come to the point.
Excuse me.
Flint, the government needs you.
Yes, well, it's good to be wanted, sir.
This is the most important assignmentever offered!
I hope you find a good man for your project.
Ohayo gozaimasu, Derek.
- Ohayo gozaimasu, honey.
Man does not live by bread alone.
Later.
Now, Flint, every computer designated youthe best man for the job.
That must have pleased you. -
Look, I don't bear a grudge.
I know we've had our disagreements...-
Sir, you know it doesn't work between us.
Later, baby.
Do you want a shave, sir? -
Flint, the world's in trouble!
It usually is, but it managesto extricate itselfwithout my help.
You're still the same old selfish, arrogant...!
Sir, you're getting edgy. - Don't tell me...!
Later!
Yeah?
But l...
Good evening, Monsieur Flint.
Paul, table number one.
Thank you, Maurice. - The pleasure is mine, Monsieur Flint. Merci.
Stand back, folks. Please stand back. Give the man some air. Thank you very much.
Give me that candle.
Why would anyone want to kill Mr Cramden?
I think that dart was meant for me.
It seems I have ajobwhether
I want one or not.
Gentlemen, the new head of ouroperations team, the man you selected,
Derek Flint.
Thank you, gentlemen. I accept this assignment.
Oh, I'm sorry about that crude incision, sir.
Thank you, gentlemen. We'll now have a private briefing.
I owe you my life. The medics said four more seconds...
Three, sir. - Dammit, is there anything you don't know?
A great many things, sir.
Now, ifyou'll excuse me, I'll need a few hours to prepare.
It worries me when he stops his heart.
It's over three hours, isn't it?
Yes, but it does relax him.
Must be a dangerous assignment.
Ladies.
Sakito?
You call Eddie and confirmour seats for the concert.
Gina?
Venison's almost ready to be hung. You'll take care of it?
Leslie.
Call Freddie and postpone my fitting. - Till when?
Wednesday will be all right. - Are you sure?
Of course.
Your code book. - Ifyou don't mind, I'll use my own code.
I'd rather you used this. - Mine's a mathematical progression.
40, 26, 36. It's based on...- I can imagine what it's based on.
Walther PPK with silencer. High velocity, extreme penetrating power.
Yes, it's a very fine weapon.
Tempered steel. Very effective at close range.
But I have no need for these. They're crude.
Dammit, these are the most...
Stopwatch, please.
When I nod, you start the stopwatch.
When I indicate 'stop', stop.
This needle is dipped in curare. How long did it take?
Three tenths of a second.
Now, this contains 65 weapons.
This has 82 different functions.83 ifyou wish to light a cigar.
Chemical analysis ofthat dart.
That's odd.
In addition to the poison, there were traces of garlic, saffron and fennel on the feather.
What proportions, sir? - Propor...? Here.
Marseilles. Bouillabaisse.
Huh?
Throughout the world in thepreparation of bouillabaisse, the proportion of garlic to saffron and fennel...
...is two cloves of garlic to a pinchof saffron to a dash offennel.
Now, only in a certainsmall section of Marseilles...
...are these three condimentsprepared in these proportions.
Whoever handled that dart was inMarseilles within the last 24 hours.
Goodbye, sir.
Hold it, hold it.
These are the men under your command. - I don't need anyone, sir.
You said you'd join the team.
- The team isn'tjoining me.
Dammit, man, for once you'll follow orders!
- This is my mission, sir. I work alone.
Your mission? The US Government isinvolved too, not to mention the world!
It's my show now.
You're under arrest, Flint!
I'm glad to see you kept up your karate, sir.
These men wore Battle ofthe Bulge ribbons.
There's no ribbon for the Battle ofthe
Bulge. - Exactly. They're impostors.
Gridley? He's been with us... That's Gridley!
Sir, ifyou look around the eyes, you'll see some scars.
On the bridge ofthe nose. Plastic surgery.
You've cracked. All this high living - you've cracked.
In here! They're dead! ln here! They're dead!
Gridley! - This one's gone.
Excuse me, sir. - What are you doing? What are you doing!
We still might save him.
I've got a beat.
I, uh... I'll arrange for yourtransportation to Marseilles.
Oh, no, that won't be necessary, sir. I have my own jet.
Yourattention, please. PagingMrDerek Flint.
Yourplane is ready, sir.
You said nine o'clock, Mr Flint.
Yes.
Thank you.
Mmm. Yes.
Check, please.
Finest bouillabaisse in
Marseilles, monsieur.
Merci, monsieur.
The shipment went as scheduled.
I had some free time, and only here do theyreally make bouillabaisse. I thought...
You thought? It is your musclethat thinks, not your brain.
And this in plain sight of everyone.
A harmless jar of cream. A little gift for one's wife.
A harmless jar of cream? Someone in thisden ofthieves stole it and examined it.
Well, I thought...- You will leave at once.
Look slowly to your right.
Yeah! More! Come on, baby, come on.
Come on, let's see you work hard.
Come on, baby!
Hello, Flint. - 0008.
I wanted a word with you.
- Yeah, my pleasure.
Narcotics. A new, powerful drug. Hear anything?
No. SPECTRE involved? -
It's bigger than SPECTRE.
Who is it?
GALAXY.
GALAXY? ls that all? - That's it.
So long, 0008. - So long, Flint.
Hans Gruber, Hitler Youth Movement, escaped during the Nuremberg trials.
I'm a much nicer person now.
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
Appenine-Tuscan kaolin.
Water from the Pontine Marshes.
Cold cream.
Rome? Why the hell is he going to
Rome? - I don't exactly know, sir.
'To buy ajar of cold cream.'
Cold cream. Cold cream, eh?
The world is crumblingand he's buying cold cream.
Yourreport? - Mr Flint will cause no more trouble.
An interesting statement, butnotfactual.
The explosion. I heard it myself.
The explosion was live, and unfortunatelyso is Mr Flint.
Thanks to Rodney's desire forproof, we discovered there were no remains.
Why didn't you tell me? - That you were unsuccessful again?
Rodney, you mustlearn patience.
Gentlemen, forgive me. You are scientists.
As such, you are accustomed to failure.
It merely increases your desire for success.
But in my business, failure is inexcusable.
We've treated Flint too lightly.
He's too dangerous to live.
Yes. We've lostseveralgoodmen, anda valuedfriendin Gruber.
Gentlemen, I'd welcome the opportunity...-
We have notyetlost confidence in Gila.
Mr Flint will cause no more trouble. I...
...havejust received the information I requested.
You mean the impregnable Mr
Flintdoes have one weakness?
No, Dr Schneider. Four.
Madam? - Yes, would you unzipper me, please?
Thank you.
'Am walking into... trap.'
'Heading for the Exotica Beauty Factory.'
'If lucky, will lead to laboratory.'
'If not, please send flowers.'
I'm leaving for Rome immediately.
You can contact me at the embassy.
Gila? Our visitorhas arrived.
Good. Now I can silence him permanently. - Put away the gun.
Violence hasn't worked. You have proof...
...ofthat. Besides, how do you know he is alone?
All right, Gila. But you'd better be right this time.
It is my responsibility to deliver Flint.
Buongiorno. Do you have an appointment?
Well, not really, but I would liketo see the manager, if at all possible.
My card.
Please, I couldn't think of accepting this.
Yes?
There's a man here. He's very insistent...- My name is Flint.
I didn't...- Thank you very much, my dear.
You have a very charmingand efficient secretary.
Mr Flint, do you alwaysbarge into people's offices?
No, I'd rather be invited.
Come in.
I've a feeling I was expected. Have we met before?
Twice before, Mr Flint. Once in
New York and once in Marseilles.
Oh, you must have been the blond harpist.
And Gruber's friend.
And you left me a little present. Ajar like this, right?
May I look inside? - Some ofthem are harmless, Mr Flint.
You were right. We were expecting you.
Well, here I am. Now, shall wetalk about the weather?
About what? - The weather.
Of course. But not here.
Personal matters require privacy.
Oh, you have some little place in mind? A... a trap?
You are prepared to take some risks, no?
I'll answer all your questions. Is that a deal?
It's cold cream. - Cold cream.
Yes, it's a deal.
How romantic. Rome at night.
A sky full of stars.
It is marvellous, isn't it?
You can almost see a whole galaxy from here.
Shall we discuss it further?
I thought we were gonnatalk about the weather.
You won't believe me. You're too shrewd, tooexperienced to pay attention to our secret.
You try me.
They are controlling the weatherfrom inside a volcano.
Right. Inside a volcano.
Where? Where is this volcano?
Not so fast, Mr Flint.
There are many other details.
Get some brandy.
Now, tell me more about that volcano.
He took the key. He's on his way.
You say you speak English? - Yes, sir.
This man you described, you took him to this address?
Yes. He was the one who was sitting therefiguring out the lottery numbers.
Mm? Oh. Yeah.
There's the building...
What's the trouble? - There's no building.
Will someone tell this idiot to make sense? - All right, now what happened?
Do you think he...? - General,
I didn't have anything to drink.
Now, just a minute. Nobody's accusing you of anything.
We both know there was a building there.
And buildings can't disappear into thin air.
So what happened to the building?
- It disappeared into thin air.
Great intelligence work. Your next post will be Peyton Place!
You talk about discipline.
Why did you stop me from killing Flint?
- Are you questioning my loyalty?
No, no.
I merely thought you might have felt...
...certain stirrings.
You are romantic yourself, Rodney.
There's verylittle air in thatsafe.
Flint will die of suffocation.
Your way wouldhave been kinder. - Myapologies, Gila.
How very thoughtfulyou are.
'Have discovered locationof enemy headquarters.'
'Advise you send fleet thereat once and destroy it.'
Congratulations on the capture ofFlint.
You have done well, Section Four.
You willbe pleased to knowFlint's fourplaymates have arrivedatheadquarters, andare nowin the proc essofbeingprogrammed.
Get him back! We gotta find that location! - Yes, sir.
That's it. That's... What's the message?
'Will give you location later.'
'Am headed for...
...a family reunion. Regards, Flint.'
A... family reunion?
Well, you were right. He's dead.
You will arrange for the coffin.
- I've already arranged it.
It's on its way. - You were very sure.
Yes. Weren't you?
Send it.
This photograph arrived minutes ago.
It speaks for itself.
He was the best.
Undisciplined, but the best.
He was a legend.
Yes, sir? At once.
Gentlemen, your attention, please. The television screen.
I don't know, sir. It's on all channels.
Who are they?
People ofthe world, there is no need to panic.
Please do notbe alarmed.
We are yourfriends.
Members ofthe Grand Council, youjust witnesseda live transmission, remote-controlledfrom the Arctic region. - Get a radio fix on this.

I've been instructed to have you conferwith your governments and reconvene here...

Take over.
Gila, we're approaching the island. Do you want to go on deck?
Oh, no. Why force themto turn offthe waterfall?
What nonsense. As iftherecould be a man like that.
I believe your friend in the box therewas brought up on stuff like that.
Poor heroic Mr Flint.
Report, please. - Section Four reporting. Mission successful.
You have proof?. Afterall, you havemade quite a few unsuccessfulattempts.
That's true, Dr Wu, but...-
Valuable time has been wasted.
Several colleagues have been lost, and all through sheer negligence.
Had I been in charge, Dr
Wu, things wouldhave...
...been different. Flint was only a man.
Mr Flint was no ordinary man!
We have his body with us. - How unfortunate there was no other way.
Report to headquarters. And congratulationson the elimination ofFlint.
No! Help!
Absolutely no one is getting through, sir.
Gentlemen, I give you Mr Flint.
Come on.
Say, why does that eagle attack me?
He's been trained to recogniseand attack Americans.
An anti-American eagle.
It's diabolical.
Come on. We can't keep 'em waiting.
Mr Flint,
I am Dr Krupov.
Doctor.
I am very happy to meet you in person.
Thank you, sir. - And this is Dr Wu and Dr Schneider.
How do you do? - Dr Schneider.
Dr Wu.
Gentlemen... I have not hadthe pleasure of meeting Mr Flint.
I am Malcolm Rodney.
Oh, yes.
How very smart you lookin your
GALAXY uniform, Mr Flint.
Don't you think so, Gila?
We found this in his pocket, sir.
The Americans' fondnessfor marvellous toys!
A weapon too, perhaps?
You are obviously anextraordinary fellow, Mr Flint.
That you have come this faris a great tribute, Mr Flint.
Well, thank you. - I would say it's more of a tribute to Gila.
To Gila? - Yes.
Or rather to her individuality.
She has allowed self-interestto supersede her loyalty to GALAXY.
If Rodney had shown me more loyalty...- I carried out your orders.
We were unsuccessful three times.
I could have disposed of Flint!
- Gila, Rodney is right.
As head of Section Four, you wereresponsible for every mission.
But I have given my life to GALAXY.
Gentlemen, it seems to me...
...that what it comes to is this: ln a moment of extreme decision, our dear Gila made an instinctive choice.
But that choice was not for GALAXY.
Her conditioning is incomplete. It is our mistake.
We made a sentimental misjudgment.
True, Dr Schneider. True. You understand,
Gila. Now, you will be taken to the...
No. It's not fair.
Gila, GALAXY may be served in many ways.
As a woman, there is one wayin which you may best serve GALAXY.
Gila! Gila!
Take her to Preparation.
Take her to Preparation.
How often woman's animal nature triumphs!
Perhaps now, Dr Wu, you'll admit that I was correct.
Strength has its merits, Rodney, but I value intelligence higher.
Gentlemen, Mr Flint's seemingly limitlesstalents can be of value to GALAXY.
Of course. - Yes.
I think Mr Flint has outlived his usefulness.
- We will be the judge ofthat, Mr Rodney.
Mr Flint, we welcome you to GALAXY.
To GALAXY!
Gentlemen,
I thank you very much for your kind offer, but you must know that
I came to GALAXY...
...not to join the organisation, but to destroy it.
You see, gentlemen?
He's not worth saving.
When something is deadly, you kill it!
- It is a new world we offer, Mr Flint.
Gentlemen, your priceis much too high for me.
You are wrong, Mr Flint.
Hear us, Mr Flint.
We seek no master race. We are the friends ofthe common man.
Surely you must have noticedthe absence of guns here in our paradise.
Violence is a last resort.
It was only the unenlightened resistance ofa...
...decadent world that triggered our actions.
Under our guidance you willbecome a useful scientist.
Take him to Preparation.
Wait!
Gentlemen, I'm sorry.
But all my instincts tell me that
Mr Flint's archaic sense of independence...
...mayeventually re-emerge, with disruptive results.
Dr Krupov is right.
Flint will never conform.
It may be best to return him to his elements.
The electro-fragmentiser.
I wonder what it is that always makesthe Rodneys choose the wrong side.
Enjoy your defiance.
It'll be the last pleasureyou have on this earth.
You're a foolish man, Mr Flint.
Gentlemen, the temperature in the Arcticis still rising, and so is the water level.
Sir? It's unanimous.
Capitulation.
The fleet is in readiness?
Yes, sir.
Request permission to joinAdmiral
Davenport in my old unit.
Thank you, sir. I'll leave at once.
Thank you, sir.
Repeat: Mysole purpose in lifeis to bringpleasure to my companions.
My sole purpose in life is to bringpleasure to my companions.
All thatis asked ofme I willperform.
All that is asked of me I will perform.
Itis an honour to offermybodyto the service ofGALAXY.
It is an honour to offer my bodyto the service of GALAXY.
Repeat after me: I am not a pleasure unit.
I am not a pleasure unit.
I am not a pleasure unit.
I am not a pleasure unit.
We have to get up to thatcommunications room. My lighter...
Our lighter has been fragmentised.
They are expecting me in the reward room. - Reward room? What's that?
Never mind. You'll love it.
Brand me.
What?
It's our only chance.
Go ahead.
Present the unit, please.
- Pleasure Unit 504.
Present the unit, please.
Pleasure Unit 736.
Unit 736 is welcome here.
Enter, 736, andgo to the firstrobing room.
It's me, Anna. You're not a pleasure unit.
You're not a pleasure unit.
You're not a pleasure unit.
Now listen, girls. You stay right herewith
Gila. I'll be back for you all shortly.
Where are you going?
I'm going to put GALAXY into orbit.
Ladies andgentlemen, the president ofthe United States.
My fellowAmericans, whatlhaveto say does not come easily.
Butl cannotshirk myresponsibility, nor can lkeep from you the gravityofthe crisis we are nowfacing.
Itis with a heavyheart thatlmakethe following announcement:
People ofallnations, all ofyou knowsomething ofthe events ofthe pastfew weeks...
Flint?! - It can't be!
Of course it can. That's why he's Flint.
Purple alert!
We have allbeen witness...-
Purple alert. Purple alert.
All units, air and naval. The mountain island, latitude 18 degrees 9 minutes north,
Iongitude 11 degrees 3 minutes west. Destroy! Destroy!
Commander, the bridge.
Are you there, sir? Sir, stall!
Stall, dammit! Flint is alive!
Uh, no, uh...
No great decision...- 54, 22, 37.
Does anyone know this code? - No.
No. - Well, it must have some meaning.
Communications room, Dr Wu speaking. Come in, please.
Communications room? Dr
Krupov. Come in, please.
Come in, please. Dr Schneider calling.
- Rodney, check communications room.
Communications room? Dr
Schneiderspeaking. Come in.
Communications room, come in...
Attention. Attention.
Flinthas escaped. Findhim.
Findhim.
There he is! Get him!
Get back! The wheel! - The steam!
Somebody kill the steam!
I'll get it...
Get Flint!
Up there!
Don't, Mr Flint! You will destroy the...
...potentialof all of mankind, organised for good.
Not for my good, Dr Wu. - Mr Flint!
It would mean an end for all time topoverty, disease, doubt and frustration!
Mr Flint, we have the power to doaway with excessive heat and cold!
To turn wastelands into Gardens of Eden! -
All I have to do is take a bite ofyour apple?
No, thanks. - No, Mr Flint!
Mr Flint! No!
Ours would be a perfect world! Why?
Because it's your idea ofperfection, gentlemen, not mine.
It is better to surrender than todestroy this great work. Agreed?
Yes! - Agreed!
All right, Mr Flint. The power is yours. Take it.
Please, take it, Mr Flint. There has been too much violence.
It is senseless to take more lives. - It is not senseless to take one more life!
Hey! Come on!
You people out there, pay attention!
Lower a boat. - Aye aye, sir.
Blankets.
Bring them up to the bridge.
Sir?
Yes, sir?
Yeah! Over a waterfall, sir. Yes, in steel drums.
Yeah, that's right. In drums!
D-r-u-m-s.
Yes. Oh, he wrecked the whole island!
He had no drum, he dove offthe topofthe island. Gotta be a world record!
No, sir, I don't know his political affiliation.
He is young enough to be a senator, yes, sir.
I believe he's aboard, sir. Wouldyou like to speak with him? Yeah.
Flint? Flint, our commander in chiefwould like to...
The commander in chiefwould liketo congratulate you and your friend.
Flint!
I'm sorry, he's indisposed at the moment, sir.
What?
I can't hear ya!
SHOCHIKU COMPANY, LTD
What's this all about?
I've never seen the sky this colour before.
It's just like flying through a sea of blood.
Ladies and gentlemen, this plane will pass Oshima and Suzuka and reach Itami Airport at 5:40 p.m.
A drink?
No thanks.
"BRITISH AMBASSADOR
ASSASSINATED WITH RIFLE"
Mr. Mano, Japan's becoming like America, isn't it?
What do you mean by that?
Using a rifle to kill people.
It's a pity to have lost such a fine man.
The Ambassador was trying his best to find a way to settle the trouble in Southeast Asia.
Tokuyasu, do you really mean what you're saying?
What...?
Your company exports weapons.
Won't you be in trouble if peace comes to Southeast Asia?
Isn't that so, Mrs. Tokuyasu?
Yes.
What are you talking about, Noriko?
I'm no match foryou, Mr. Mano.
The world's in a terrible shape.
Trouble between nations grows worse with terrorism breaking out all overthe place.
Everything's gone crazy!
You should get yourself a bodyguard, Mr. Mano.
You must take care.
You can't tell who your enemies are.
Nonsense! I'm not afraid to die.
A politician who fears his enemies would end up a nervous wreck.
Flight JA 307 here. Over.
We just received a report that there may be a bomb on the plane.
The suspect may try to commit suicide.
He wrote to Police HQ saying he would blow up the plane.
Return to Haneda Airport at once.
I repeat. Return at once!
Roger!
Check everyone's bags.
And quickly!
Yes, sir!
Ladies and gentlemen. We have to perform a check of your bags.
Please have your bags open and ready for inspection.
Please.
Thank you very much.
Why are you checking our bags?
The control tower contacted us.
It seems that the bag of a passenger taking the next plane was loaded on here by mistake.
What sort of bag?
We aren't sure. They didn't tell us.
Have you the right to open other people's bags?
This is Mr. Mano of the Kenmin Party.
It's extremely ill mannered!
I don't mind. Go ahead, if you must.
But...
Thank you.
Excuse me, sir.
Were there important papers or something in the missing bag?
Or was it a bomb?
What?
It's the fad nowadays to plant bombs on planes or trains to blow them up.
Isn't that it?
There's no bomb!
In that case, everything's alright.
Is what he said true?
No, sir.
It's not true? It's a mistake?
Yes. Important company papers are in the bag. That's all.
Please cooperate with us.
Don't talk nonsense!
What's so funny about frightening people?
I'm a psychiatrist, my friend.
I like to study the reaction of people driven to the limit of their endurance.
You should get your own head checked out.
Please.
The suicide of a bird.
So it's not just human beings?
Do birds lose the will to live?
No. It's not that at all.
The birds are frightened.
I wonder why.
Something extremely unusual is happening.
Extremely unusual?
Birds are sensitive creatures.
I can't think that this is a natural phenomenon.
Thank you.
Your bag, sir?
I don't have any.
What?
Mr. Sugisaka.
Get me a screwdriver. I'll open it.
But if it's a bomb, when you open it, it might...
We can't leave it as it is.
It's a rifle, not a bomb.
Whose is it?
Only one man didn't have a bag.
It must belong to him!
You shouldn't meddle with things.
Who told the police about a bomb?
Dunno.
What'll you do now?
What're you doing?
Now, you can't contact anyone.
Change your course to Okinawa.
I refuse!
You can't refuse.
The lives of the passengers are in my hands.
Change your course.
A flying object has been sighted.
There is every indication that it intends to invade Japan's airspace.
The Japanese Defence Force and the US Air Force are in pursuit.
A warning has been issued to all planes to avoid its flight path...
What's that?

Miss Asakura!
Miss Asakura!
Are you okay? We're alive.
There may be more survivors.
Let's check.
Yes.
Mr. Tokuyasu. Are you okay?
Mrs. Neal!
Mrs. Neal!
Are you hurt?
Anything broken?
Just stay calm.
Mr. Mano! Mr. Mano! Wake up!
You're safe. You're okay.
Are we the only ones alive?
How's your wife?

Fool!
Mrs. Tokuyasu! Wake up!

Mrs. Tokuyasu!
Mr. Mano!
How do you feel?
Are you hurt?
Are you hurt?
What're you doing out there?
Damn. He saw me!
It's dangerous outside!
Come back at once!
It's dangerous! Come back!
Come back!
Wait for me!
Wait!
Wait!
Watch out!
Are you trying to kill yourself?
It was you, wasn't it?
Where's the bomb?
Dunno.
You know.
Tell me.
Where is it?
I never had a bomb in the first place.
It was just a joke...
I lied in my letter to the Police.
There's no bomb.
Why did you do it?
Why?
There's no fun in this world.
Are we the only ones alive?
You! Contact the Haneda
Control Tower at once.
I'm afraid I can't.
That gunman wrecked the radio.
What's that?
Where are we, anyway?
I don't know.
You don't know?
We started to return to Haneda, but he forced us to change course.
So I've no idea where we are.
Listen, I'm a busy man!
Do something about it!
What're you going to do?
Don't you have any bright ideas?
We can't waste time.
The General Election is coming up.
I understand, but we'll have to wait forthe rescue team.
And what are we supposed to do in the meantime?
Now look. Are you sure a rescue team will be here by tomorrow?
I hope so.
That's not good enough!
Not one plane has passed over while we've been here.
But a rescue party's bound to come.
I'm sure of it.
I don't believe it.
Don't just stand there.
You caused the plane to crash.
Now find a way out of this mess.
It wasn't our fault.
The gauges went wild, that's why we crashed.
Faulty gauges?
What rubbish!
Birds acting strangely... faulty gauges...
We saw something. A weird light.
A light?
It flew right over the plane.
It was blinding.
Then the plane crashed after that?
Yes.
Don't try to get out of it.
You're responsible for the crash.
It's true!
Who's going to believe such fantasies?
No, we can't write it off as fantasies.
There are things in this universe that mankind does not understand yet.
You can't deny that.
What planet are you from?
What line of work are you in?
I'm a researcher in space biology.
No wonder you've got such weird theories.
It's hot.
Where's the water?
That's the only water we have.
There's nothing else to drink?
No, there isn't.
You used all the water?
I'm crazy! Need water!
Stop it!
It's all becoming very interesting.
As a psychiatrist, I should benefit a great deal from what happens next.
What are you talking about?
No water, and nothing to eat.
What happens to people in times like this?
Everyone wants to live, so we shed our civilised veneer.
Then we cease to be human beings.
We become beasts!
The weak become the victims of the strong - the law of the jungle.
In the end, everyone dies.
We can't hang around here.
Mr. Mano, let's get going.
Please wait! It's dangerous outside!
Move aside!
Wait until morning!
We're going. You can wait if you want.
Mr. Mano, isn't it important forthe nine of us to cooperate?
If we keep bickering, we'll ruin our chances of survival.
Please understand what I'm saying.
Shut up and stand aside!
Stop it!
Move!
No!
Move, I said!
Please understand!
Move when I say so!
Move!
If you're going to shoot, shoot.
What are you waiting for? Shoot him!
If you don't, he'll kill us!
Give me the gun!
Drop the gun!
What are you?
"BRITISH AMBASSADOR
ASSASSINATED WITH RIFLE"
Then you killed the Ambassador?
Who paid you to do it?
I don't know anything about it!
What's that?
Miss Asakura!
Miss Asakura!
Miss Asakura!
Miss Asakura!
Miss Asakura!
What happened?
I'm afraid!
What did you see?
Miss Asakura!
What do you want?
Mr. Mano, you must be tired.
I found some whisky. You have it.
Mr. Tokuyasu, we're digging graves for the dead.
Why not dig your own grave too?
Gasoline! It's dangerous!
Where was she?
Where did he go?
Isn't that his rifle?
I found it on a ledge but he wasn't around.
He wouldn't run away leaving a hostage and his gun.
Could he have fallen off the cliff?
Tell me, what happened to him?
Where is he?
Tell us! Where is he?
What're you doing?
...next the news.
The jetliner that vanished today has still not been found.
Rescue planes found no traces of the missing plane.
It is feared that there may be no survivors of this strange incident.
When we have any further news' we'll broadcast it without delay...
The fool!
How dare he say we're all dead!
Damn it!
Okay. The rescue party isn't coming.
We can't stay here. Let's go.
There's a murderer outside.
He's hungry for blood.
What'll we do then?
In order to save ourselves, we must first find out what's become of him.
We don't even know where he is.
She's so frightened she can't speak.
There's nothing we can do.
Make her talk.
Make her talk? How?
Go to sleep.
Into a deep sleep.
Deeper.
Just relax.
Keep looking into the flame.
You're so tired and the flame brings you sleep.
You're sleeping deeply now.
Just remember what you saw.
Tell me what you saw.
So, try to remember what happened.
You saw something which frightened you.
Tell me everything about this terrifying thing.
What was it?
You're remembering?
So, tell me. Will you?
What happened to that man?
Now, open your eyes.
You can answer my questions.
Try to remember what happened to the man who took you off the plane.
What did you see out there?
It shines!
It's blinding!
It shines. What is it?
The light makes a noise?
And then what?
It went out.
Where? Where did it go out?
It shines! It's blinding!
I know that.
What happened after that?
Did the man go into the light?
You saw something.
What did you see?
What happened when he went into the light?
I'm afraid!
You saw it?
Now, tell me.
Tell me.
What is it that you are so afraid of?
Wound!
Was he wounded?
Inside the wound!
Miss Asakura! Is that true?
It's a lie!
I don't believe it.
She's lying!
That's right. It must be a lie!
I don't want to believe it, but it's true.
What blinding light? Impossible!
No, it's possible.
The light she saw... I imagine it could have been a flying saucer.
Flying saucer?
I see.
So that's what that light was.
The same thing that caused our crash.
Nonsense!
Flying saucers don't exist.
There's no evidence for them.
You're wrong.
What?
What you say is a mistake.
People have seen flying saucers in many parts of the world.
We can't deny it.
So what?
Since the A-bomb was dropped in Hiroshima, there has been an increase in the number of flying saucers.
It seems that while man destroys, slaughtering his fellow man in senseless wars, space creatures plan to invade.
What's she saying?
She says war's absolutely unacceptable.
Her husband, who's been fighting in Vietnam, died a week ago.
She was on her way to the US base in Iwakuni for her husband's remains.
What're you doing?
Why'd you have to go and do that?
To find out what happened.
Shut up! We were better off not knowing! You shouldn't...
It's too late to say that now.
You all agreed to it, didn't you?
Tell me. What she said was all lies, wasn't it?
It's the truth!
All lies! They have to be!
Tell me they're lies!
What she said is true. It's the truth.
What?
You scum!
What're you doing?
You pushed him off, didn't you?
No! I didn't do it!
Liar!
Let's lock the murderer up!
No! I didn't do it!
Listen to me!
Open the door!
I didn't do anything! I didn't do it!
Let me out of here!
Open the door!
Let me out!
I can't stand it I here!
I'll go mad!
What's all that noise?
Something really frightened you?
Something happened to me?
Yes. You had a nightmare.
Forget all about it.
Don't let it get you down. Be strong.
We're going to live no matter what happens.
Is it morning yet?
Water! Isn't there a drop of water?
Mr. Mano. You're not the only one who wants water.
Please hold out until morning.
Stop it!
Whisky will only burn your throat.
Is it the wind?
No, it's not the wind.
It may be Mr. Momotake.
He can't be alive. Don't open it.
Mr. Momotake!
Mr. Momotake, is that you?
What's she saying?
She says she can't let him lie there.
What?
His wound reminds her of how her husband died.
A napalm bomb ripped open her husband's face.
Sugisaka, are you out of your mind?
Please move aside.
There's no telling what he'll do if we let him in!
Look. He came back to ask for help.
And he doesn't have a gun, now.
He's wounded.
Saga. Please help me.
He's dead.
A deep wound like that, and yet no blood.
What's the reason?
I've got a bad feeling.
Find anything out?
No.
Something inconceivable is about to happen.
Birds killing themselves, that strange light, flying saucers and now that gaping wound on his face.
Something we can't imagine is in control.
Stop pretending to be a prophet!
Water's more important!
Give me water!
Mr. Mano. There's still a drop of whisky left.
What?
That's what you get for drinking too much whisky.
Tokuyasu!
You knew drinking whisky would only make you thirstier, didn't you?
Well, you'll just have to bear it.
You offered Mr. Mano whisky on purpose?
You wanted to enjoy seeing him suffer, didn't you?
Bastard!
Stop it!
If we keep on quarrelling like this, we'll never get out of here.
Somebody, get me some water!
Before I die!
Tokuyasu, get me some water, and I'll seriously think about giving you that government contract.
Seriously?
Then you weren't really considering giving it to us before?
I see.
I thought as much.
I wanted to know what you really thought.
That's why I offered you the whisky.
You rat!
The only reason you approached our company in the first place was to get us to give you money.
Tokuyasu, this is no place to say such things!
I don't give a damn who hears it.
You've accepted nearly one billion yen from my company!
I gave you plenty in return!
Your company was going bankrupt.
Now it's one of the richest in Japan.
Who do you have to thank for that?
Don't make it sound like you did us a favour.
You owed us much more than that!
Tokuyasu. You'd be nothing without me!
Tokuyasu!
Give it to me! Please!
Give me that water! Please!
Mr. Tokuyasu, give him the water.
Please! Don't be so cruel, give it.
Do you want this, Mr. Mano?
If you want it, you'll tell everyone the reason you were going to Osaka.
But that's...
I approached you to make money.
I even threw in my wife as a treat.
Now tell them your half of the deal.
Come on, speak!
You tricked me and now you'll pay.
Stop it! Don't do that!
Now, Mr. Mano. Tell them.
Now. Say it nice and loud.
Stay where you are!
I'll say it then.
You were coming with me to Osaka to receive thirty million yen from my company.
That's the truth!
And in return you were to pressure the government so they would buy all their weapons from my company.
It was all a pack of lies.
You had no intention of keeping your word to us.
Wouldn't the voters laugh if they saw you now?
Tokuyasu!
When we get out of here, you're through!
I'll see that you're ruined for life!
You see if I don't!
Mr. Tokuyasu, don't be foolish!
Don't move!
Outside!
Don't be foolish!
Shut up!
Go!
Get out!
Out!
Okay.
You too!
Get out!
Stay back!
What're you going to do?
Stop it!
Stop it, I say!
Tokuyasu!
Tokuyasu!
Don't look.
Please go back to the cabin.
The blood's gone.
It's all been drained from his body.
What?
Mrs. Tokuyasu.
It's his punishment.
He sold his own wife, just to get ahead in business.
He deserved to die like that.
You despise me, don't you?
No, that's no true.
I don't care what anyone thinks.
After all these years,
I've escaped from his grip forever.
I'm free at long last.
Now I can do whatever I want.
It's hot, isn't it?
Shouldn't it be dawn soon?
He caused me such pain.
He shouldn't have had to die in this terrible way.
Saga.
Saga, you know what caused this.
Please tell us.
No, I don't.
I have no idea.
You do.
You're keeping something from us.
Just a guess.
Only conjecture.
I'll most likely be proved wrong.
If I say what I think, it'll only upset everyone for no reason.
I see. I still want to know.
Why was he killed in that way?
To be drained of blood. Tell me why!
Noriko!
Mrs. Tokuyasu!
Noriko!
Mrs. Tokuyasu!
Noriko!
Mr. Mano, did you find her?
No.
Let's search over there.
Hey, Noriko!
Noriko!
Noriko!
Noriko!
Noriko!
Noriko!
Wait there.
Earth people.
You cannot understand us so we are talking through her.
We are the Gokemidoro people.
We live in a universe far from Earth.
We've marked Earth for a long time and we have now raided it.
Our plan is to wipe out all of mankind.
The end has come and mankind is on the verge of destruction.
It is your own fault that we have chosen you for annihilation.
You have already turned your world into a monstrous battlefield.
Noriko!
Noriko!
How terrible.
She was brainwashed.
Nonsense!
The aliens brainwashed her to convey their will to us.
That's enough!
You're lucky to be so blind.
You saw that terrible thing happen, and you still don't believe it.
Saga. Don't hide the truth.
Tell us.
Explain what happened to Noriko.
I believe in the existence of aliens.
You think there are such things?
There are theories about these creatures.
They possess a high intellectual standard, that much we know.
They're also scientifically advanced.
Or else they'd never have crafts capable if interplanetary flight.
They've been seen in many parts of the world.
I think they've been gathering in preparation for their attack.
Now they've chosen the moment and begun their attack.
That's absurd!
Even with proof, mankind refuses to believe in them.
They prefer to ignore this threat from alien invaders.
Instead, they fight each other.
The space men must be pleased.
We've made it easy for them.
These creatures know that their best chance is when men are preoccupied with killing each other.
Mankind doesn't stop to think before it takes action.
He was right. The Gokemidoro said we'd be destroyed.
But we don't need any outside help to bring it about.
What rot! Talk some sense!
Mano!
You saw what happened out there.
Death caused by a vampire.
Aliens have taken over his mind.
And yet you still don't believe it.
Listen.
Intellectuals always try to mislead people by talking loads of rubbish.
Mr. Mano. How can we make you understand?
I'll believe it when I see a vampire with my own two eyes.
But even then...
I'd like to see one suck blood too.
Eh?
I'll never get a chance like this again.
As a scientist, it would be invaluable.
I must see it.
Well, that's interesting.
Let's experiment and see.
How can we?
There's an easy way.
Pick a victim.
That's crazy!
One will die to save the rest.
Human sacrifice has gone on for centuries.
I agree with Mr. Mano.
I want to see it.
Sacrificing human lives?
Have you both gone mad?
Science and governments make progress at the cost of many lives.
That's a fact that can't be denied.
Mr. Saga!
Tell Mrs. Neal that she can join her late husband.
No! I won't let you murder her.
She's a foreigner.
No trouble later.
I won't tell her.
Mr. Mano, you call yourself a human being?
Then you be the victim.
Water! Please!
Please. Give me water!
We'll throw him out.
Get away, watch out!
Mrs. Neal!
Mrs. Neal!
Get in the cockpit.
Hurry!
Get in.
Get in!
Sugisaka!
What're you doing?
Hey! Let me go!
Don't leave me!
I can't believe it.
I can't believe in anything any more.
Sugisaka.
Mrs. Neal is afraid.
I know that.
Still, there are limits to what a person should do.
Let me in!
Let me in!
Let me in!
The bomb!
So.
The bomb's been there all the time.
Open up!
If you don't, I'll blow up the plane!
Stay away!
Stay away!
Stay away!
Watch out!
My legs!
My legs are hurt!
Saga!
We can't waste any more time.
Let's get going!
What about Mr. Saga?
We'd better leave him behind.
What?
Let's get out of here.
Please stay.
My friend. Don't worry.
I won't leave you here.
Thank you.
You go. I'll make a stretcher.
We'll follow you.
You're fools!
Mano!
Hurry!
Ah! It's him!
Well now, we can leave pretty soon.
I'm sorry to be a burden to you.
It serves me right.
I did the worst thing a human being could do.
No wonder I was punished for it.
You go on. I'll only slow you down.
What are you saying?
We're not going to let those creatures get you.
You know, I'd lost all faith in my fellow man.
But by being with you two,
I feel there's still some hope left for humanity.
Listen.
Don't lose hope.
Otherwise life would be unbearable.
Yes, that's true.
We must believe in each other.
Help me, please!
Please help me!
Someone, help!
Help me!
Mano!
What're you doing?
Mr. Mano!
Mr. Mano!
Mr. Mano!
Mr. Mano!
What kind of a beast are you?
Miss Asakura, run!
Miss Asakura!
Mr. Sugisaka!
So he's dead now.
I'm safe at last.
If we stay here, I'll be too late for the general election.
Let's go.
Hey.
Say something.
What are you mad about?
What's bothering you, anyhow?
You're not going to tell everyone when we get back are you?
I suppose you think that you can ruin my entire political career.
Now see here.
This was an abnormal situation.
It's only natural we act strangely.
You were no different to anyone else.
Do you really think that you'd be able to finish my political career?
Who would believe anything that you have to say?
Hey. For god's sake speak up!
Say something!
Say something!
What're you doing?
Let him go.
Hands off!
Hurry, run!
Mr. Mano!
Run!
I don't want to die! Let me live!
He's after us!
Run!
Watch out!
Mr. Sugisaka!
Mr. Sugisaka!
Run! Go on alone!
Mr. Sugisaka!
We're safe, aren't we?
Let's go.
Mr. Sugisaka!
I can't make it.
You must live.
Live no matterwhat happens.
They're dead.
What's happened?
Hey. Excuse me.
Listen now.
We are the Gokemidori from a distant planet.
So beware.
We are going to destroy your entire world.
You are through.
You have arrived at your final day of judgement.
Meet your doom, for not one of you shall survive.
It is too late to wish you had lived differently.
Why did this have to happen?
It's too late.
Mankind is through.
It's too late to repent.
THE END
And that completes my final report until we reach touchdown.
We're now on full automatic, in the hands of the computers.
I've tucked my crew in for the long sleep and I'll be joining them soon.
In less than an hour we'll finish our sixth month out of Cape Kennedy.
Six months in deep space.
By our time, that is.
According to Dr. Hasslein's theory of time in a vehicle traveling nearly the speed of light, the Earth has aged nearly 700 years since we left it, while we've aged hardly at all.
It may be so.
This much is probably true.
The men who sent us on this journey are long since dead and gone.
You who are reading me now are a different breed.
I hope a better one.
I leave the 20th century with no regrets, but... one more thing.
If anybody's listening, that is.
Nothing scientific. It's... purely personal.
Seen from out here, everything seems different.
Time bends.
Space is... boundless.
It squashes a man's ego.
I feel lonely.
That's about it.
Tell me, though...
Does man, that marvel of the universe, that glorious paradox who has sent me to the stars, still make war against his brother, keep his neighbor's children starving?
Are you all right?
Stewart?
We're in the soup!
She's sinking!
Dodge, read the atmosphere!
Landon, get out a last signal!
What signal?
To Earth! That we've landed!
The air's OK!
Blow the hatch before we lose all our power!
It's no use! The power's gone!
Forget it! Abandon ship!
She's sinking.
Going...
Gone.
OK. We're here to stay.
Well, where are we?
Do you have any notion, skipper?
We're some 320 light years from Earth on an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.
Is that close enough for you?
That could be Bellatrix.
It's too white for Bellatrix.
You didn't have time to read the tapes.
So you really don't know, do you?
What went wrong?
We weren't programmed to land in the water.
The question is not so much where we are as when we are.
We've had enough sleep to hold us for a while.
Let's start earning all that back pay.
Dodge, run your soil test.
- Got your sensors?
- Right.
- Geiger counter?
- Got it.
Let's see. One pistol,
20 rounds ammo, a medical kit, camera, TX9.
We've got food and water enough for three days.
How long is a day?
That's a good question.
Landon!
Hey, Landon!
Join the expedition.
Sorry. I was thinking about Stewart.
What do you suppose happened?
Air leak. She died in her sleep.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
It's a little late for a wake.
She's been dead nearly a year.
That means we've been away from Earth for 18 months.
Our time.
You've gone gray.
Apart from that you look pretty chipper for a man who's 2,031 years old.
I read the clocks.
They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis.
We have been away from Earth for 2,000 years, give or take a decade.
Still can't accept it?
Time's wiped out everything you ever knew.
It's all dust.
Prove it.
If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
It's a fact, Landon.
Buy it. You'll sleep better.
Nothing will grow here.
There's just a trace of carbohydrates.
All the nitrogen is locked into the nitrates.
No dangerous ionization?
No.
Well...
If there's no life here, we've got just 72 hours to find it.
That's when the groceries run out.
Let's go.
Which direction?
That way.
Any particular reason?
None at all.
Come on...
Everybody all right?
Water check.
Eight ounces.
It doesn't add up.
Thunder and lightning, and no rain.
Cloud cover at night.
That strange luminosity... yet there's no moon.
If we could just get a fix.
What would that tell you?
I've told you where you are and when you are.
All right, all right.
You're 300 light years from your precious planet.
Your loved ones are dead and forgotten for 20 centuries.
Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Taylor, quit riding him.
There is just one reality.
We are here and it is now.
You get hold of that, or you might as well be dead.
I'm prepared to die.
He's prepared to die.
Doesn't that make you misty?
Chalk up another victory for the human spirit.
Clue me in on something, will you?
Why did you sign on for this trip?
You volunteered. Why?
Never mind. I'll clue you in.
You were the golden boy of the class of '72.
When they nominated you for the big one, you couldn't turn it down.
Not without losing your all-American image.
Climb off, will you?
Oh, and the glory. Don't forget that.
There's a life-size bronze statue of you standing out there somewhere.
It's probably turned green by now and nobody can read the nameplate.
But never let it be said that we forget our heroes.
Taylor, I'm telling you to climb off my back.
And there's one last item.
Immortality.
You wanted to live for ever, didn't you?
Well, you damn near made it.
Except for me and Dodge, you've lived longer than anyone ever born.
And with our lovely Lieutenant Stewart dead, it looks like you're the last of the line.
You got what you wanted, tiger.
How does it taste?
OK. You read me well enough.
But why can't I read you?
Don't bother.
Dodge, there. He's not like me at all.
But he makes sense.
He'd walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something that no other man knew.
But you... You're no seeker.
You're negative.
- And I'm not prepared to die.
- I'd like to know why not.
You thought life on Earth was meaningless.
You despised people.
So what did you do? You ran out.
No, no. It's not like that, Landon.
I'm a seeker too.
But my dreams aren't like yours.
I can't help thinking somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. Has to be.
Taylor, over here!
Life.
Where there's one, there's another.
And another and another.
Let's find 'em.
Skipper!
Look!
Scarecrows?
Let's see.
To hell with the scarecrows!
Taylor!
Look at this.
Taylor, look!
They didn't leave much, did they?
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
Blessed are the vegetarians.
They look more or less human, but I think they're mute.
We got off at the wrong stop.
You're supposed to be the optimist, Landon.
Look on the bright side.
If this is the best they've got around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
Smile.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
This one.
Will he live?
I don't know.
This beast has lost a lot of blood.
There's no probe here. Find one!
Yes, sir.
This place is dirty, doctor.
Doctor, these animals are dirty. They stink and they carry communicable diseases.
Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
You don't sound happy in your work.
I'm little more than a vet in this laboratory.
You promised to speak to Dr. Zaius about me.
I did. You know how he looks down his nose at chimpanzees.
But the quota system's been abolished.
- You made it. Why can't I?
- What do you mean - made it?
I'm an animal psychologist, that's all.
We have no authority.
You do all right when it comes to getting space and equipment.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here in studies of cerebral functions of these animals.
They're still dirty, doctor.
And their bite is septic.
There. Look at that.
Hold his jaw.
- Good morning, Dr. Zira.
- Good morning, Julius.
- How's our patient today?
- No change.
The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
Well!
And what do we want this morning?
Do we want something? Come on. Speak.
Come on.
Speak.
Do we want some sugar, old-timer?
You could get hurt doing that, doctor.
Oh, don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
They're all tame until they take a chunk out of you.
Well, Bright Eyes.
Is our throat feeling better?
Still hurts, doesn't it?
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
That Bright Eyes is remarkable.
He keeps trying to form words.
You know what they say.
Human see, human do.
Now what?
He seems to want something.
I'd be careful, doctor.
What did I tell you?
Try that again and I'll break your arm!
Good morning, Your Excellency.
Dr. Zaius.
Good morning, sir.
Open up, please.
I'm so glad you could come.
Sir, he's over here.
Bright Eyes...
Show him. Go ahead.
Do your trick.
Speak.
Go on. Speak again.
There! Can you believe it?
Yes, amusing.
A man acting like an ape.
Dr. Zaius,
I could swear he's answering you.
He has a definite gift for mimicry.
Most unusual.
He's using that old blanket as clothing.
I wonder how he'd score on a Hopkins manual dexterity test.
An animal?
Look!
He's moving his fingers.
Only because he saw you moving yours.
But perhaps he understood.
Man has no understanding.
He can be taught a few simple tricks.
Nothing more.
I'm afraid I must disagree.
- According to my experiments...
- Dr. Zira, I must caution you.
Experimental brain surgery on these creatures is one thing, and I'm all in favor of it.
But your behavioral studies are something else again.
To suggest that we can learn anything about the simian nature from the study of man is sheer nonsense.
Besides, man is a nuisance.
He eats up his food supplies in the forest, then migrates to our green belts and ravages our crops.
The sooner he is exterminated the better.
It's a question of simian survival.
Is this the one you wanted, doctor?
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Bright Eyes, I've got a present for you.
Put her in with him.
Cornelius! Up here.
Do you have to work tonight?
No.
Neither do I.
Oh, Cornelius.
There's Bright Eyes.
The one I was telling you about.
What's so special about him?
Watch.
Hello, Bright Eyes.
How's our throat today?
- Look! She remembers!
- Remembers what?
The blood transfusion.
Zira, really!
You know, they can't... Watch out.
Here comes number one.
Something's bothering him.
He's been prying around the lab for the last two days.
Good morning, Dr. Zaius.
- You know my... Dr. Cornelius, my fiancé.
- Of course.
The young ape with a shovel.
I hear you're planning another archaeological expedition.
- With the Academy's approval, sir.
- The project will require my support.
I hope I may count on it, sir.
Cornelius, a friendly warning.
As you dig for artifacts, be sure you don't bury your reputation.
Guard!
Stop!
You'll hurt him!
Take him inside.
Cornelius! Cornelius, if you have a moment today,
I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
Certainly, sir. I'll pick up my notes and I'll come right over.
I don't understand these animal psychologists.
What's Dr. Zira trying to prove?
That man can be domesticated.
- What happened?
- Oh, those fools and their torches.
- Do you have any ointment?
- I'll see.
I'm sorry, Bright Eyes.
Julius!
I told you what you'd get!
Julius, don't, don't, don't!
It doesn't matter!
Julius, don't hurt him!
Julius!
Natural-born thieves, aren't they?
Get me a collar and leash.
- I'm taking him out of here.
- He's vicious, doctor.
- Besides, it's against the rules.
- Do as I say!
You... you wouldn't hurt me, would you,
Taylor?
It's a stunt.
Humans can't write.
Dear, you're a scientist.
Don't you believe your own eyes?
Where did you learn to do this?
"Jefferson
Public School."
"Fort Wayne,
Indiana."
Back on that planet you say you came from?
Maybe he is intelligent.
But he is also... crazy.
Cornelius.
Cornelius, please.
"Dodge was killed in the hunt."
"What happened to... Landon?"
I don't know.
They fell out of the sky with you?
"Not fell. Flew."
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
And even if it weren't, why fly?
Where would it get you?
"Do you have maps?"
We're here. You were captured here.
You fell into the water here?
You came ashore...
Marched across the desert?
Mountains?
Many days and nights.
And reached the jungle.
Out of the question.
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
No creature can survive in the forbidden zone. I know. I've been there. I've seen it.
"Then how do you account for me?"
I don't.
And I'm not going to try.
But what about your theory?
The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Do you want to get my head chopped off?
Don't be foolish.
If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
No, they won't.
Cornelius has developed the most brilliant hypothesis.
But I'm probably wrong.
That the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man.
In his trip to the forbidden zone, he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time.
- The evidence was very meager.
- You didn't think so then.
That was before Dr. Zaius and half of the Academy said my idea was heresy.
How can scientific truth be heresy?
What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed?
A mutation.
A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape.
Touchy, isn't he?
"I am not a missing link."
Well, if he were a missing link, the sacred scrolls wouldn't be worth their parchment.
Well, maybe they're not.
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm not going to get into that battle.
- Cornelius, show some strength!
- Zira, listen to me!
Now, we both have fine futures.
Marriage, stimulating careers.
I'm up for a raise.
Dr. Zaius.
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
No, sir. I was just collecting my notes.
You know Dr. Maximus, of course.
Our commissioner for animal affairs.
Yes, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
What is that?
A man, Dr. Maximus.
I know it's a man. And you know the rules.
No animals allowed outside the compound, and most especially not without a leash.
Yes, sir, but... but this creature is a special case.
Why special?
We're conducting a new experiment.
Wouldn't that more properly be done in your office?
Yes, sir.
Guards, return this beast to the compound.
What is this?
A toy.
It floats on the air.
Zira...
Try it.
Nonsense.
- What's up, lieutenant?
- We're taking number four to surgery.
- Have him ready.
- How come?
- The beast's throat's nearly healed.
- The vet's going to geld him.
Dr. Zira won't like it.
She wants that pair to mate.
These orders come from Dr. Zaius himself.
There's nothing she can do about it.
If only you knew what they're going to do.
Stay still now. Don't give me any trouble.
Weep if you must, but make an end of sorrow.
He lives again.
Yes, he has found peace in heaven.
He was a model for us all, a gorilla to remember...
Hunter, warrior, defender of the faith.
Cherished husband, beloved father, generous master, yes.
He was a font of simian kindness.
The dear departed once said to me
"I never met an ape I didn't like."
Look! It's a man!
In heaven's name! Get rid of that creature!
Catch him!
Catch him! Catch him!
Come on, Quintus.
- Go get him!
- Taylor!
- Why did you run away?
- Security police.
I'm in charge of this man.
He is in the custody of the ministry of science.
Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!
No one'll listen to me.
Only you.
You.
Nova.
You... Nova.
No...
Yeah. Me Tarzan, you Jane.
What are you doing?
Leave her alone, damn you!
Where are you taking her?
Damn you! You hairy scum!
Shut up, you freak!
Julius, you...
I said shut up!
It's a madhouse!
A madhouse!
Now I don't even have you.
Imagine me needing someone.
Back on Earth I never did.
Oh, there were women. Lots of women.
Lots of... lovemaking, but no love.
That was the kind of world we'd made.
So I left because there was no one to hold me there.
Did I tell you about Stewart?
Now there was a lovely girl.
The most precious cargo we'd brought along.
She was... to be the new Eve.
With our hot and eager help, of course.
Probably just as well she didn't make it this far.
Do you love me, I wonder?
Can you love, I wonder?
Well...
You're not as smart as Stewart, but you're the only girl in town.
Look at that. I...
I taught you to smile.
It's been weeks.
What happened? Where have you been?
Why didn't you come to see me?
- What is this?
- A hearing.
- Be clever. Be quiet.
- All rise!
Be seated!
This ad hoc tribunal of the National Academy is now in session.
The president of the Academy presiding.
On my right, Dr. Maximus, commissioner for animal affairs. And on my left,
Dr. Zaius, minister of science and chief defender of the faith.
And appearing for the state,
Dr. Honorious, deputy minister ofjustice.
Bailiff! Your instructions:
To clean up the beast.
These rags he's wearing give off a stench that's offensive to the dignity of this tribunal.
You may proceed,
- Dr. Honorious.
- By your leave, Mr. President, this tribunal has not yet defined the purpose for this inquiry.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case.
Surely you must know why you're here.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
Objection!
This exhibit is indeed a man.
Therefore he has no rights under ape law.
Dr. Zira, this is a man,
- is it not?
- He is unlike any man you have ever seen.
As we hope to prove.
Answer the question, Dr. Zira. Is it a man?
Sir, perhaps the... question is the point at issue.
Is he a man, is he a deviant, or... a freak of nature?
- Objection!
- Sustained.
Now, Dr. Zira, in all fairness, you must admit that the accused is a non-ape and therefore has no rights under ape law.
Then why is he called the accused?
Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
The creature's not being tried.
He's being disposed of.
It is scientific heresy that is being tried here.
Well put, Dr. Zaius.
Let us warn our friends that they endanger their own careers by defending this animal.
Then I'll... defend myself.
Dr. Zira, would you tell
Bright Eyes to be quiet?
- My name is Taylor!
- Bailiff! Silence the animal!
Wait! Let me...
You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.
Learned judges, my case is simple.
It is based on our first article of faith.
That the almighty created the ape in his own image.
That he gave him a soul and a mind.
That he set him apart from the beasts of the jungle and made him the lord of the planet.
These sacred truths are self-evident.
The proper study of apes is apes.
But certain young cynics have chosen to study man.
Yes! Perverted scientists who advance an insidious theory called evolution.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorious.
The state charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues, to produce a speaking monster.
That's a lie!
Mind your tongue, madam.
Did we create his mind as well?
Not only can this man speak, he can think! He can reason.
That can reason?
With the tribunal's permission, allow me to expose this hoax by direct examination.
Proceed, doctor. But do not turn this hearing into a farce.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes, what is the second article of faith?
I know nothing of your culture.
I admit that.
Of course he doesn't know our culture, because he cannot think!
Tell us... Why are all apes created equal?
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Ridiculous!
Tell us, Bright Eyes.
Why do men have no souls?
What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Read this for me.
Since the defendant has been forbidden to speak in his own defense, he requests that the following statement be read into the record.
You read it, Dr. Cornelius. Read it.
"I have, uh, come to you from a planet in a different solar system."
"I am an explorer in space..."
Stop right there. Let me see that paper.
It's a joke.
In very poor taste.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
Dr. Zira, you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
You state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions with him at the time of his capture.
That is his assertion.
Mr. President, in addition to Bright Eyes,
I believe the prosecutor has reassembled all the surviving humans that were captured in the hunt.
That's true, Dr. Zaius.
Very well.
Then I suggest that we... go take a look at 'em.
That's him! That's Landon!
- Which one?
- The tall one in the back.
Do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
- With one of them, yes.
- Identify him, then. Speak to him.
Landon?
Landon.
Oh! They cut him!
Did you know about this?
No. I... I swear.
I never saw this man before.
But they...
You did it.
You cut up his brain, you bloody baboon!
Stop him!
Take him inside!
Mr. President, a word of explanation.
The human specimen you saw outside suffered a skull fracture in the course of the hunt.
Two fine veterinary surgeons under my direction were able to save his life.
But the beast could not speak, of course.
Nor will he ever speak.
You did that to him, damn you!
Cut out his memory, took his identity, and that's what you wanna do to me!
Bailiff! Gag the animal!
Damn you!
May it please the tribunal,
I grant you that this creature cannot have come from another planet.
But this much is certain. He does come from somewhere in the forbidden zone.
He's described the region to us and described it accurately for...
I have been there.
You visited the forbidden zone?
Yes, sir.
A year ago.
With the permission of the Academy.
He exceeded his orders.
His travel permit was canceled immediately.
Yes, sir. That is true, thanks to you.
But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the sacred scrolls were written.
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant!
Sustained. Your archaeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Let them talk, Mr. President.
Let them talk.
Sirs, our theories have a bearing on his identity.
How so?
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false.
But if he did not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own.
Yes! Sprang! As an animal psychologist,
I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
- Objection!
- Sustained!
Their speech organs are adequate.
The flaw lies not in anatomy, but in the brain.
- Objection!
- Sustained!
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
Yes! Behold this marvel!
This living paradox!
This missing link in an evolutionary chain!
Silence there!
You go too far.
I think an indictment is in order.
Yes, sir. The state charges Drs. Zira and
Cornelius with contempt of this tribunal, malicious mischief, and scientific heresy.
It is so ordered.
This tribunal will examine the evidence and in due course render its verdict.
As to the proposed indictment and as to the disposition of the deviate in question, this hearing is adjourned.
Wait outside.
Well, the verdict is in.
At the moment, your two simian friends and sponsors are free on bail.
But they'll soon be brought to trial for heresy.
What about me?
Your case was preordained.
In a way, you did the state a service because you made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.
Now the tribunal has placed you in my custody for final disposition.
Do you realize what that means?
No.
Emasculation to begin with.
Then experimental surgery on the speech centers - on the brain.
Eventually a kind of living death.
However,
I have it in my power to grant a reprieve.
That is why I summoned you here tonight.
Tell me who and what you really are and where you came from, and no veterinary shall touch you.
I told you that at that hearing of yours.
You lied!
Where is your tribe?
My tribe!
They live on another planet in another solar system.
Even in your lies, some truth slips through.
That mythical community you're supposed to come from -
Fort Wayne.
- What about it?
- A fort!
Unconsciously you chose a name that was belligerent.
Where were you nurtured?
Then... you don't believe that prosecutor's charge that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira?
Certainly not.
You're a mutant.
That's what Zira and Cornelius claim.
You're talking heresy, doctor.
Of course!
Suppose I am a mutant.
How can the appearance of one mutant
- send you into a panic?
- Because you're not unique.
- There's the one you call Landon.
- Oh. Then you admit that...
I admit that where there's one mutant, there's probably another and another.
A whole nest of them.
Where is your nest, Taylor?
Where are your women?
Thank you.
Thank you for calling me Taylor.
Dr. Zaius,
I know who I am.
But who are you?
How in hell did this upside-down civilization get started?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level.
And deservedly so.
Our eastern desert has never been explored because we've always assumed that life cannot exist there.
Taylor, save yourself!
Tell me, is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone?
I don't know.
If you're trying to protect others of your kind, it'll cost you your identity.
I'm not protecting anyone.
This whole thing is insane!
What have I done?
You are a menace.
A walking pestilence!
I do know who you are, Taylor.
I'll give you just six hours to make a full confession.
After that
I shall use surgery to obtain one.
Guards!
All right. You can cut pieces out of me.
You've got the power.
Return this creature to his cage.
But you do it out of fear!
Remember that!
Because you're afraid of me!
What are you afraid of, doctor?
Are you Julius?
- Who are you?
- I'm from the office of animal affairs.
That male is to be transferred to the zoo.
At this hour?
Who says so?
Don't they tell you anything?
The antivivisectionist society is up in arms.
They're gonna save this beast from those butchers in the lab.
If he can speak, he belongs in a public zoo, but what'll probably happen is some money-mad grown-up'll put him in a circus, and we'll have to pay...
Stop making speeches and show me the order!
This order's no good.
It must be countersigned by Dr. Zaius.
Grab him!
Who are you?
So you can talk!
I'm Dr. Zira's nephew.
This abduction was her idea.
You're not really going to the zoo.
That's our story if somebody stops us.
Get me out of this.
We've gotta move fast!
She comes along too.
- Zira doesn't want your female.
- I want her.
If you insist, but I'm not taking any orders.
All right. Come on! Let's go!
- I told you not to bring the other one!
- He wouldn't leave her.
Oh, all right. Come on!
- Here. Put this on.
- Don't you have any clothes for me?
What do you expect? An ape's new suit?
- This stuff stinks!
- Well, so do you. Like all men.
Taylor, remember, all men look alike to most apes.
So put it on and keep quiet, and we may just get away with this. Hurry!
Cornelius!
How'd it go?
Come on!
Let me out of this!
Well, Taylor, we're all fugitives now.
Do you have any weapons? Any guns?
The best. But we won't need them.
I'm glad to hear it. I want one anyway.
Taylor, I'm in charge of this expedition!
Good for you.
But you're not in charge of me.
Not any more.
I don't plan to be caught again.
- As you wish.
- Dr. Zaius seemed to think there was another jungle beyond the forbidden zone.
I'll try for that. What about you?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy.
Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
You're going back to the forbidden zone?
We're going back to the diggings
I worked at over a year ago.
It's a three-day ride across the desert.
Near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
- You still don't believe me, do you?
- It's a long detour to Dead Lake.
- What would we find?
- Nothing much.
An empty rubber life raft. Maybe a... little flag, the emblem of my countrymen.
The terrain around that lake is poisonous.
There's no fresh water, no vegetation - nothing.
Anyway, I... ought to thank you for saving me. You'll be in trouble for that.
We've been in trouble since the moment we met you.
What's she pointing at?
This must be close to home for her.
She knows it.
Nova, no. Nova!
Nova, you can't go there!
It's not safe! Nova!
We'd better get started.
If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far.
Right. Let's get the water and provisions into the wagon.
Cornelius!
Where does this river lead to?
It flows into a sea some miles from here.
That's where we'll find the diggings.
And beyond that?
I don't know. You can't ride along the shore at high tide and we had no boats on our last expedition.
You never told me - why do you call this the forbidden zone?
No one knows. It's an ancient taboo, set forth in the sacred scrolls.
The lawgiver pronounced this whole area deadly.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
I'm for that.
Well? Do you like it?
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
In my world, when I left it, only kids your age wore beards.
Beards?
I don't go in for fads.
Somehow it makes you look less intelligent.
When will you show me what's in that cave?
Right now, if you like.
Cornelius!
- Lucius, don't fire at them!
- You're all under arrest!
If there's any more shooting,
Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to go.
You can count on it.
You are not in command.
Put down that gun.
Shut up!
Very well.
Lower your weapons.
Tell them to pull back around the rocks, out of range.
Withdraw!
How did you know we'd come here?
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate would flee to the forbidden zone.
And only a fool would give a gun to an animal.
I see you've brought the female of your species.
I didn't realize that man could be monogamous.
On this planet it's easy.
I'll ask you to reconsider the rash course you've undertaken.
If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years, but if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
We never meant to be treasonous, sir.
But up there, in the face of that cliff, there is a vast cave, and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
There's your minister of science.
Honor-bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
- Taylor, please!
- Except he's also chief defender of the faith.
There is no contradiction between faith and science - true science.
- Are you willing to put it to the test?
- Taylor, I would rather...
Take it easy. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can return the favor.
What is your proposal?
When were those sacred scrolls of yours written?
1,200 years ago.
All right. If they can prove those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history, if they can find some real evidence of another culture from some remote past, will you let them off?
- Of course.
- Let's go up to the cave.
Sorry, Lucius. You've got to stay here and guard the camp.
Always giving orders.
Just like every other adult.
Relax. You'll get to see it all later on.
Present your evidence, Cornelius.
It was at this level that I discovered traces of an early ape creature.
A stage of primitive barbarism really, dating back some 1,300 years roughly.
It was at this level... I discovered cutting tools and arrowheads of quartz and the fossilized bones of carnivorous gorillas.
But the artifacts lying here were found at this level, and date back... 700 years earlier.
That's the paradox.
For the more ancient culture is the more advanced.
Now, admittedly, many of these objects are unidentified.
But clearly they were fashioned by beings with a knowledge of metallurgy.
Indeed, the fact that many of these tools are unknown to us suggests a culture which in certain ways equals our own.
Some of the evidence is uncontestable.
Don't speak to me in absolutes.
The evidence is contestable!
I apologize, sir.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude to say the least.
There are geologists on my staff who'd laugh at your speculations.
But there's the doll, sir.
What?
Oh, lying right there. The human doll.
What does this prove?
My granddaughter plays with human dolls.
The doll was found beside the jawbone of a man and no trace of simian fossil has been found in this deposit.
Your conclusion is premature.
Have you forgotten your scripture?
The 13th scroll?
"And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden and chained him to a tree,
- and the children did make sport of him."
- No, sir, I have not forgotten.
Well, for a time the ancients kept humans as household pets until our lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed.
Keep digging, Cornelius.
You'll find evidence of the master of this house...
An ape.
What are you doing?
Reconstructing a past life.
You say these things were found at the same level as that doll?
Whoever owned them must have been in pretty bad shape.
He wore false teeth.
And eyeglasses.
He had a failing heart.
Towards the end, he... had this prefabricated valve put in it.
I don't say he was a man like I knew at home, but he must have been a close relative.
He had all the same weaknesses.
He was a weak, fragile animal.
But he was here before you and he was better than you are.
That's lunacy! I can offer alternate descriptions of every one of those articles which is just as ingenious as yours.
But it'd be conjecture, not proof.
Mamma!
Dr. Zaius, would an ape make a human doll that talks?
Lucius!
You dirty...
Nova!
Cornelius!
Zira!
Help me!
Mamma!
I oughta kill you right now.
Come on!
Tell 'em to pull back. Now!
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Up there!
Withdraw!
Get down!
Lucius, are you all right?
They took me by surprise.
Sneaked up on me while I was feeding the horses.
What's happened to honor?
I got off two rounds to warn you.
- They've taken everything.
- Not quite everything!
They left a hostage behind.
- How are you feeling?
- Disillusioned.
You can't trust the older generation.
I know what you mean.
I want you to go round the rocks and tell those gorillas I've got Dr. Zaius prisoner.
Yes, I can do that.
I want a horse, food, and water.
Enough for a week for me and this female.
- And 50 rounds of ammunition.
- What if they won't agree to your terms?
Tell them I'll shoot him.
Taylor, you can't!
Oh, yes, he can.
He's a born killer.
Deliver the message.
Over here.
Sit down.
Taylor, please! Don't treat him like that!
- Why not?
- It's humiliating.
The way I was humiliated... by all of you?
You led me around on a leash!
That was different.
We thought you were inferior.
Now you know better.
Cornelius was right, doctor. He proved it.
Man was here first. You owe him your science, your culture,
- whatever civilization you've got.
- Then answer me this.
If man was superior, why didn't he survive?
Wiped out by a plague, some natural catastrophe, a storm of meteors.
From the looks of some parts of this planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
But we can't be sure.
He is.
He knew all the time.
Long before you found your cave, he knew.
Defender of the faith?
Guardian of the terrible secret.
- That's it, isn't it, doctor?
- What I know of man was written long ago.
Set down by the greatest ape of all, our lawgiver.
Cornelius, come here.
Reach into my pocket. Read to him the 29th scroll.
6th verse.
"Beware the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn."
"Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed."
"Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land."
"Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours."
"Shun him."
"Drive him back into his jungle lair."
"For he is the harbinger of death."
I found nothing in the cave to alter that conception of man and I still live by its injunction.
That's far enough!
They think you're behaving foolishly.
I must say, I agree!
Where will you go?
To start with, I'll follow the shoreline and my nose.
But suppose you find nothing but... but wasteland?
How will you survive?
He won't survive.
Nova.
How about coming along?
- We can't.
- It's better than going to jail for heresy.
Oh, they can't convict us of heresy.
You've helped prove our innocence.
Besides... his culture is our culture.
Well, good luck, then.
Lucius.
I still say you're making a mistake.
That's the spirit. Keep 'em flying.
- What?
- The flags of discontent.
Remember, never trust anybody over 30.
Doctor, I'd like to kiss you goodbye.
All right, but you're so damned ugly.
Don't try to follow us.
I'm pretty handy with this.
Of that I'm sure.
All my life I've awaited your coming and dreaded it, like death itself.
Why?
I've terrified you from the first, doctor.
I still do.
You're afraid of me and you hate me. Why?
Because you're a man.
And you're right.
I have always known about man.
From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy.
His emotions must rule his brain.
He must be a warlike creature who gives battle to everything around him, even himself.
What evidence?
There were no weapons in that cave.
The forbidden zone was once a paradise.
Your breed made a desert of it... ages ago.
It still doesn't give me the why.
A planet where apes evolved from men.
There's gotta be an answer.
Don't look for it, Taylor.
You may not like what you find.
Untie me!
No, no, no! Wait!
Wait!
Let him go!
Lieutenant, fetch your explosives.
We're going to seal up the cave.
Yes, sir!
- Seal the cave?
- That is correct.
And you will both stand trial for heresy.
- But the proof! The doll!
- In a few minutes there will be no doll.
There can't be. I'm sorry.
Dr. Zaius!
Dr. Zaius, you mustn't! You promised!
What I do, I do with no pleasure.
- Silence him!
- Doctor.
Dr. Zaius, this is inexcusable!
Why must knowledge stand still?
What about the future?
I may just have saved it for you.
What will he find out there, doctor?
His destiny.
Oh, my God!
I'm back!
I'm home.
All the time, it was...
We finally really did it.
You maniacs!
You blew it up!
God damn you!
God damn you all to hell!
No object in the endless sea of space has aroused man's curiosity...
...more than the planet Mars.
In particular, the shape and form of Martian life.
For centuries, astronomers have searched in vain...
...to solve this mystery.
It has challenged the creativity of the world's greatest writers...
...and the imagination of its most gifted artists.
Some envisioned Martians as huge, birdlike beasts.
Others described fantastic serpents of incredible size...
...grotesque, tentacled creatures.
Shapes, sizes and forms beyond man's wildest imagination.
Animal, vegetable, mineral...
...even mechanical creatures of enormous destructive power.
But all this is conjecture.
At last, you will learn the simple truth about life on Mars.
As Normandy Productions lights the fuse...
...that put The Three Stooges in Orbit.
Where you will meet the true image of the men from Mars.
Hollywood, California.
Glamour capital of the world...
...where movie history was first written by such greats as Valentino...
...Fairbanks, Pickford.
Today a new chapter: television.
And carrying on in the tradition of the immortals, we find....
Hey, hey, Caruso. You want the manager should hear you?
If she finds out we're cooking in the room, we're goners.
You know the trouble we had finding this place.
You better start cooking for the TV show for tomorrow.
Or you'll answer to me.
-Now sound off.
-Okay, chief.
Hello, everybody! It gives me pleasure on this monotonous occasion--
Hey, hey, it's "momentous."
Mo-mentous.
What are you giving me two words for when I have enough trouble with one?
I smell cooking in there.
-Battle stations.
-Open the door, or I'll use my keys.
Let old buzzard-face in.
Hey, jughead!
The hat, the hat!
Oh, Miss McGinnis, you're looking the same as ever.
Thank you.
Now, I know I've detect the odor of cooking in this room, which this hotel will not tolerate!
Cooking? What a lively imagination.
I dare say it's the aroma from the beanery across the street.
It floats in here all day long.
Well, you know the rules, and as the manager here, I....
Do you have to play that so loud?
-Well, you know what this means.
-Yeah, it means goodbye.
Bye!
Now remember, the last place was the 10th place we were thrown out of.
So watch your p's and q's!
Wait a minute, get a load of this.
"Lonely retired gentleman desires boarders. Home cooking."
Home cooking!
Where is this idyllic habitation?
-Oh, those kind of words you can say?
-Yeah.
-Why.... Where is it?
-It's Hawk Hill Manor in Lompoc.
Lompoc?
Well, Lompoc, here we come!
Boy, oh, boy!
An echo.
-Looks like a country club for zombies.
-You ought to know.
-Did you hear that?
-Yeah.
Wait a minute,
I heard it the first time.
Welcome to Hawk Hill, gentlemen.
I'm Professor Danforth.
You came in answer to my advertisement?
-Yes, we did.
-Quite a cozy place you got here.
Thank you. Great-grandfather built it over 100 years ago.
No! It doesn't look a day over 98.
Thank you, and won't you come in, please?
Okay.
As you can see, I've got lots of room here, plenty of--
I see you're interested in my new invention.
This, gentlemen, is my all-purpose military vehicle.
The full-scale model is nearing completion in my workshop.
I've been working on it for months.
Here are the plans.
This button operates it underwater.
This one propels it up in the air.
And this one puts it in orbit.
I think this guy's in orbit already.
Sorry, professor, but I'm afraid we'd be in your way.
-We'll be seeing you.
-No.
No, wait, please. My days are so lonely and monotonous.
It's "momentous."
Hey, I said it!
Quiet.
It will be so nice to have earthlings in the house for a change.
Pardon me, did you say, "earthlings"?
That's right. I'm often bothered by a spy from outer space...
...who's trying to steal my plans.
A terrible-looking thing.
Claws instead of hands, a hideous green face, sharp yellow fangs.
Oh, the regular monster type.
Monster?
That's right, yes, exactly.
-Okay, professor, we'll stay.
-Yeah, sure.
-What have we got to lose?
-Yeah.
Thanks. William will show you to your tombs.
I mean rooms!
Moe?
-About that professor--
-Don't pay any attention...
...to what the old guy said about the spy from outer space.
He's been bending over those diagrams too long.
Well, just the same,
I'm taking no chances.
-Where did you get that?
-Off the wall.
Chicken. If anything happens,
I'll be across the hall.
Now get some shuteye. We gotta be in shape for our show tomorrow.
-Good night.
-Good night.
On this "monanimous" occasion....
That's not right. "Moninimous."
-"Modinimous--"
-Dream about it!
Turn out the lights, I'm bushed.
Moe, they're here!
-They're here!
-What are you yelling about?
-They're here.
-They're here? Who's here?
-From outer space.
-You're off your rocker.
No, listen to me, Moe.
I'm telling you the truth.
Oh, Mable, you're here at last.
You swept me off my feet.
I'm being carried away.
I'm safe.
Safe in your arms, darling. Safe.
He's here.
The spaceman, I saw him.
A guy could get murdered.
-It'll be you if you don't let me sleep.
-Moe, please. Come on. I'll show you.
Come on, right in here.
I know it happened right over here.
I'll show you. Right there.
The claw came through there.
It looked just like a can opener.
Then it pulled the chain like that, and then it went back in the wall...
-...and this covered the hole.
-Hole? The hole is in your head.
Why can't you be like Larry, sleeping like a baby?
Move over, Larry, and let Joe in.
Move over, I said!
Now, any more trouble out of you, and
I'll give you something to yap about.
Look!
Gotcha!
Hey, I got him, Moe.
A tourist from Mars.
Yeah, sure, with a card from the Diners Club.
Hey, lift him up.
I'll look for a rope.
-Hey, Moe, it's the butler!
-It's always the butler.
Here comes another one.
Hey, wait. Hey, it's Larry.
You're all right.
It was only a blow on the head.
Oh, my, what happened?
That's him, that's the fellow who tried to steal my plans!
No, he's innocent.
It was the butler.
He's got a space gun.
What did he say?
Come on.
Well, I'm not afraid of that popgun.
That probably shoots corks.
Kazakoni yourself.
Got a long way to run, fellas!
You leave my machine alone.
Stop, I tell you--!
-Wait a minute, fellas.
-What do you mean?
-We've got a long way to run.
-We don't have to run.
-We got a car outside.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
-The keys are in my pants upstairs.
Would you like to go get them?
Well, like you say, Moe, we've got a long ways to run.
Wait, wait, wait!
Martians!
Flying saucers!
FBI? Never mind the clerks,
I want Mr. Welby.
-Welby here.
-Mr. Welby, I talked to you before.
Professor Danforth.
Yes, professor, what can I do for you this time?
That butler I told you was after my invention?
Well, he's from Mars, all right.
I just caught him talking to his boss on closed-circuit TV.
I tell you, they're coming after us with scads of flying saucers.
Send someone right over.
I'd love to, professor, but unfortunately all my men are busy right now.
We're rounding up a herd of man-eating caterpillars from Venus...
...that are trying to crush city hall!
What's the matter, you a nut or something?
Mr. Welby?
Mr. Welby, come back!
They're gonna blow up the whole world.
"Hollywood television studio,
Stage 1." The Three Stooges.
Somebody's gotta listen!
Come on, fellas, we've got less than an hour to make our TV show.
Let's go!
-The studio!
-Follow me, boys.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Three Stooges Scrapbook!
And now from Hollywood, California...
...The Three Stooges are on the air!
Hello, everybody, it's a great pleasure on this momentous occasion--
-Hey, hey, you're stealing my line.
-Okay, say it.
On this monotonous occasion....
I knew it, why....
-Hey, this is getting monotonous.
-It's momentous.
He got it too.
And now, youngsters, get set for that mad, zany, Three Stooge cartoon.
Roll the film, go, go, go!
-Boy, are they ugly.
-Especially the one in the middle.
-Stop playing around!
-Are you crazy? Hey, look at that.
-That fat fellow, he's a doll, isn't he?
-Come on, go. Come on.
You wanna watch your remarks, boy.
Hello, boys. How would you fellows like to play mutiny?
-Mutiny?
-Mutiny?
-What's that?
-I'm glad you asked that.
-What's that?
-I'm glad you asked that.
Well, gentlemen, I see that you've finally made it. Late as usual.
And now a word from your sponsor,
Mr. Yuk Yuk himself.
-Mr. Galveston?
-Of Galveston?
Correct. And I don't mind saying
I'm considerable riled...
...because you got here so late. And
I hear you been doing this quite often.
-But I can explain.
-I don't want explanations.
And another thing, if you hombres can't come up with a different type...
...of cartoon show, it's gonna be the end of the trail.
What's wrong with what we're doing now?
-What kind of show do you want?
-I couldn't tell you, boys.
I'm a businessman, not a showman.
I just want something better than ordinary cartoons.
-You've gotta come home with me.
-We're in conference.
Our cartoons ain't ordinary.
I see the same thing on every cotton-picking show.
-Mr. Howard, please.
-Go away, professor, you bother me.
On the other hand, if you can dream up something brand-new.
Oh, they'll never make it, G.G. Their contract expires in 10 days.
Okay, meet you here at 6:00 in 10 days.
And remember, a completely different kind of cartoon show...
...or you're all through.
Saddle up my Rolls-Royce, son, and I'll be on my way.
Right away, G.G.
Gentlemen, if your sponsor really wants something new...
...I think I've got it.
Electronic cartoons.
-Electronic?
-Exactly.
The most startling new process since the magic lantern.
-Boys, you help me and I'll help you.
-Keep talking, grandpa.
-Come back home with me.
-Wait a minute.
I wanna say that after you left, I caught that sneaking butler talking to Mars.
I tell you, they're getting ready to invade us with flying saucers.
I saw myself on his television set.
-He's in orbit again.
-He's flying.
Boys, you've got to help me until my work is done.
Remember, only us four can save the world from destruction.
I'd hate to send for the wacky wagon, he's such a nice old oddball.
Besides, maybe he's got something to save our show.
I don't wanna find out.
That joint gives me the creeps!
Me too. Did you see what that kooky butler did?
All of a sudden, I'm aiming a gun that ain't there.
Don't you jugheads realize we're in a spot?
You mean to tell me you'd let fear stand in the way of our careers?
-Yes!
-Do you mean to tell me...
...that you're too chicken to face up to that kooky butler?
Yes!
-With three against one?
-Absolutely!
Oh, absolutely?
Don't you know that we absolutely left all our clothes...
...and our only absolutely car up there, and you still refuse?
Absolutely!
We just took a vote, professor.
It's unanimous. We're going.
Excellent, my car is right outside.
Ten days, 240 hours. You'll never make it. Goodbye, gentlemen.
-Au revoir.
-Skip the gutter.
Break a leg.
Ogg and Zogg.
Here we are, gentlemen.
-What's the matter with you?
-Moe, I'm scared.
-Me, that's who.
-And me too.
-What's the matter, you chicken?
-Yeah.
Have a little backbone. Follow me.
Carol!
Father, I couldn't imagine where you've been.
I didn't know that you were--
I thought you were--
Oh, this is Mr. Howard and his friends.
They're staying with us for a while.
-My daughter Carol.
-I'm pleased to meet you.
-Oh, the pleasure's ours.
-Likewise, I'm sure.
I'm sorry if we scared you.
I didn't expect you back from
New York for another couple months.
-I got some time off, so here I am.
-It's wonderful to have you back, dear.
We've got something to attend to.
We'll be right back, dear.
All right, Father. It's nice to have guests in the house again.
Gentlemen, this way.
I followed him right through there.
-Did you have your glasses on?
-Glasses? No.
Oh, still chicken, eh?
Get going, come on.
Look out for that first step!
Now he tells us.
Not here.
Here, around the corner.
-I don't see no TV set.
-Are you sure it was in here?
Of course I'm sure.
It was right over here.
You better put your glasses on, pop.
Well, they could have been over there-- No, he was on the right...
...the television set was on the left, and that was right.
I just don't understand it.
He must have gone and taken that whole TV outfit with him.
I'll bet there's no electronic-cartoon gadget either.
I heard that, and that's where you're wrong, mister.
Come along with me, and
I'll show it to you.
Hey, professor, that's some contraption you've got there.
Thank you, thank you.
I don't know whether to call it...
...a seagoing heli-tank, a land-going heli-sub...
...or an airborne what-in-the-hel--
Excuse me. Anyway, it'll be interesting to see who'll win the battle for it...
...the Army, Navy or Air Force.
Gentlemen, this is the machine that is going to save our world.
Let's get to something really important.
Where's the gimmick that's gonna save our show?
Gimmick?
Oh, that's over here.
Your sponsor will renew your contract in a minute...
...after he's seen what I can do with this.
Okay, put on your glasses.
My electronic process, gentlemen.
No artist ever touched this. The whole thing was drawn by a machine.
No artist, eh?
Boy, that's amazing.
Sensational!
Now, all I have to do is figure out how to make it move.
There's nothing like a hearty breakfast to start the day off.
You know, we ought to humor the professor...
...until he finishes that cartoon gizmo.
-Yeah, you never know.
-Home cooking, home cooking.
Hey, get your hotcakes here!
Hey, fellas, the landlady!
Well, what can I say, fellas? When
I heard the knocking, it rang a bell.
-Oh, it rang a bell?
-Yeah, but I saved my hotcakes.
-Well, so you did.
-Yeah, they're mine. I baked them up--
-Oh, my, what happened?
-Well, it was an accident, professor.
See, this is the work of a birdbrained idiot.
Yeah, a birdbrained idi--
-Thank you.
-How about me?
Yeah, and a mental midget.
Go ahead.
Look, Father, the mail!
The Army, the Navy and the Air Force.
I told you there'd be a scramble for my machine.
The Army.
"Professor Danforth. Dear sir, your invention is most interesting...
...but we feel the submarine feature makes it more suitable for the Navy."
-The Navy.
-The Navy.
"The Navy feels the tank-tread feature makes your device...
...more suitable for the Army."
Listen to this from the Air Force.
"The airborne feature of your unique vehicle...
...opens up interesting possibilities.
Accordingly, the Air Force will accept your kind invitation...
...and send a representative,
Capt. Andrews...
...who will be pleased to witness the tests that you propose.
Afterwards, if results warrant, we will consider a demonstration...
-...of the full-scale vehicle."
-Oh, boy!
They're coming, they're coming!
I knew they wouldn't turn me down.
-Congratulations, professor.
-You sure put it over.
Thank you. You know, I stayed up late last night testing the model...
...and everything worked fine.
Come, I'll show you.
Clean up this mess.
I'll clean it up when I'm ready.
-Oh, you will?
-Yeah, when I'm ready.
-So?
-So I'm ready!
Hello.
-I'm Capt. Andrews, Air Force.
-Won't you come in?
Yes.
I'm Carol Danforth. I was hoping you'd come-- My father was hoping....
Well, he's right over here.
The remarkable thing about this model is that it operates...
...completely by remote control.
This is Capt. Andrews of the Air
Force. My father, Professor Danforth.
-And our guests Moe and Larry.
-How do you do, professor?
-Are you making a mistake!
-I'm sorry, sir.
-That's a bigger mistake.
-No, no, no. I'm Professor Danforth.
Yes, excuse me, professor.
Well, here she is, captain.
What do you think of her?
-Wonderful.
-When hard pressed by the enemy...
...it can take to the air, dash across country or dive underwater.
As a matter of fact, it even seeks out water.
First, I'll demonstrate how it operates as a tank.
See that, captain? It's gonna revolutionize the art of warfare.
It'll even revolutionize revolutions.
Remember, the big machine will do everything the little one does.
Could you ask for anything more?
No. Oh, no, no.
Definitely not, it's excellent.
You know, captain, you're pretty sharp. The Army and Navy didn't--
They didn't get here in time. Of course, they're hot for it too, you know.
Prepare for the water test.
-Prepare for the water test.
-Prepare for the water test.
Captain, nothing can stop this vehicle except this. Watch.
Captain, nothing can stop this vehicle except this. Watch.
Ready for the water test.
-Ready for the water test.
-Thank you.
Now, when attacked by antitank weapons...
...the pilot has only to push a button.
Now, watch how it finds the nearest water.
Wait a minute,
I gotta open the door.
Wait a minute!
-This way, captain.
-Yes, this way, captain.
Right this--
Professor, I think it needs a little adjustment.
Oh, Carol, why don't you take the captain and talk things over?
Come on, captain, this way.
I don't understand.
Watch it, that thing's going berserk.
-Where is it?
-I don't know.
Come in!
Who is it?
Get out of here! Go on!
Sounds like Curly-Joe. Come on!
It's running wild!
Hey, fellas! Hey, professor!
The propeller!
What's going on in here?
Turn that thing the other way!
Shut it off! Shut it off!
Hi, fellas.
Oh, remote control!
Cover your eyes.
Moe, Larry's cheating.
What are you doing?
Shame on you.
Well, captain?
Is the Air Force interested?
Oh, yes. I can assure you, sir, the
Air Force is definitely interested.
That's wonderful!
The big machine will be ready to demonstrate next week.
My baby, I just love you!
That's it.
How you doing, boys?
Not much time left.
Don't worry, you'll be showing it to the brass right on schedule.
Controls all checked out, professor.
Good, good, I'm working out all the bugs on the cartoon machine too.
-She'll be ready.
-What a team.
-He's got the brains, and we've got--
-What?
-The enthusiasm.
-That's better.
Larry! Joe!
-Shut it off!
-Turn it off!
Shut it off!
-Joe!
-Cut the motor off, Larry boy!
Pull the lever on the compression chamber.
Larry! Joe! Shut off this thing!
-Larry! Joe! Help!
-Shut it off!
Hurry!
Shut it off, boys!
I'm sorry, Moe. It was an accident.
Oh. Well, this is on purpose.
Polka Dot. Sweetens the breath, brightens the teeth. Tastes like pizza!
Polka Dot toothpaste, for the smile of youth and beauty.
Polka Dot toothpaste, for the smile...
...of glamour and beauty.
-Wait a minute, lunkhead.
-Why, what's the matter? I'm busy.
-You're busy?
-Yeah.
Get another big bag of water. The airfield's in the middle of the desert.
So it's in the middle of the desert.
How you coming, professor?
Oh, this will do for the demonstration.
My own secret fuel.
Got more get-up-and-go than anything ever on the market.
-I don't believe you said that.
-Well, I did because it's true.
-Someone to see you, Father.
-Hello.
-She's all gassed up and ready to go.
-Wonderful.
I thought everything was set for day after tomorrow.
It is, but Col. Lane would like to have you at the base a bit ahead of time...
...to kind of go over the details.
He invited the area commander,
Gen. Bixby.
-Gen. Bixby!
-Tom's arranged to fly you there...
-...in his plane. I can go too.
-If it's all right with you, sir.
-Yes. Oh, but the machine--
-Don't worry about that.
-We'll get her there okay.
-Professor, you go with the captain.
-And leave the driving to us.
-They'll take good care of it.
-No, I'm more familiar with it--
-See you at Baldwin Air Force Base.
I wouldn't want anything to go wrong, honey.
Don't worry, professor, you left everything in good hands.
Don't worry, professor, you left everything in good hands.
All right, let's get this mockingbird on the road.
Here.
Moe!
Moe, we got a problem!
What do you mean, we got a problem?
All you have to do is drive this thing right through that door. What--?
Oh, no, it can't be.
Yes, it can. The machine is too big to go through the door.
-Get away from here.
-What's that for?
That's for not thinking of it before.
Now you guys get busy...
...and widen that door a few feet while I check the controls.
-So we'll widen the door.
-All right, all right, take it easy.
-We'll widen the door.
-Go get the tools.
The tools there.
There's a dandy.
Yeah, you work on that side, and I'll work over here.
Pick out a good spot here.
-That ought to do it.
-Hey, bubblebrain!
-What?
-You're using the wrong side.
Wrong side?
Oh, yeah.
How silly can you get?
-Wait, you're still doing it wrong.
-What do you mean?
-You mind if I show you?
-No, but I, I'm--
Look, take this. See, when you got a tool with two heads on it...
...and the first head is pointy, you take it right there and the pointy part...
...goes right in that wall there.
-That's where the pointy part belongs.
-Yeah, how stupid can you get?
I don't know, I guess you can get pretty stupid if you're like me.
Boy, oh, boy.
Here we go.
Termites?
-Larry! Larry!
-What's the matter?
-Did you hit yourself?
-No, I didn't hit myself.
Something hit me through that hole there. Come right out, hit me.
-You see, you see.
-You're crazy, there's nothing in there.
What do you mean, there's nothing there?
-Larry, Larry! Again. Again.
-What did you do, hit yourself again?
Didn't hit myself again.
It came through the hole again.
-Oh, don't bo--
-You'll see it. Look, can you see it?
-See it?
-There's nothing there!
-Now get to work!
-All right, so there's nothing there--
Oh, yeah? What--?
Oh, no.
You're still playing around?
We got work to do.
I ain't playing around with--
Good work, boys!
At last, you did something right.
But, Moe, we didn't--
-Did we?
-Come on, boys, hop aboard.
We don't want to keep the professor waiting.
Get in there, come on.
Attaboy.
-I hope you can make it.
-There's not very much room there.
Have no concern.
When I throw this throttle in, we will ease slowly through the opening.
Twenty-two minutes late!
I can't wait for this thing much longer.
Sorry, general, but the captain assured me that it'd be here.
Here it comes!
Let's make a snappy entrance.
Believe me, this is going to be something you'll never forget.
Hey, boys!
Right here!
There's the professor.
Hi, professor!
-It's Moe! Moe's driving it!
-Come back here!
Look out, professor!
Shut her down, you bubblebrain.
Well, professor, perhaps your machine isn't quite ready yet.
Oh, yes, it is, sir.
Besides, I want you people to have it...
-...before the Martians get it.
-That's a very good--
-What did you say?
-The Martians, they want it.
Look, the airplane!
-Put on your brakes!
-I can't find a pedal.
-Use the emergency!
-The emergency.
-You mean this?
-Yeah.
The airplane!
-That was close.
-You did it.
You got us over that, boy, you are a doll.
Col. Lane, get that ship off the field!
-Ground that thing, that's an order!
-That's an order!
Don't look now, but I think we're being followed.
-Maybe we'll get a ticket.
-Hey, can you get one for my friend?
Come on.
The bookstore!
Bookstore!
Up, up, up!
Easy does it.
You came through again, Moe.
Bookstore!
Come on, you idiot.
Look out, girls!
Hey, Moe, you're heading for the general!
Look out, you'll knock him on his brass!
See that that goes back where it belongs.
Eyes right!
Sir!
I wish to report--
Now see here!
Oh, dear me.
-Andrews!
-Yes, general?
What have you got to say?
Well, I'm sorry I listened to that old crackpot, sir.
-Father, we're going home.
-Carol! Wait a minute, I'll take you.
No, thank you.
This time we'll take the bus.
And leave the court-martial to us!
How do you like that?
Visibility: zero.
-Yeah, and you can't see either.
-No, you--
Get that map out of my face!
You want me to wreck the ship?
I want to see what road we're on.
You applebrain, we haven't been on a road since we left the air base.
-How are we fixed for gas?
-How are we fixed for gas?
Well, the arrow's pointing halfway...
...so I don't know whether it's half-empty or half-full.
-Remind me to wallop you later.
-I'll make a note of it.
I'll do it now.
What are we stopping here for?
-What are you stopping for?
-I didn't stop it. It's the engines.
Well, come on, we got a repair job to do.
You are about to witness a test of the Navy's new atomic depth charge...
...which has been placed at the base of this tower.
This is the bomb.
Powerful enough to destroy every enemy submarine...
...within a radius of 6 miles.
And utterly devastate an equal area on land.
The bomb is adjusted to maximum sensitivity.
The slightest contact with moisture will set it off.
However, for test purposes...
...it will be exploded by dropping water on it from this tower.
The countdown will now begin.
Gentlemen, put on your safety glasses.
Well, that takes care of the distributor.
Just had a little sand in it.
-Give me the carburetor.
-Give me the carburetor!
Give me the carburetor, give me the carburetor.
Here it is.
Seven, six....
Three, two....
-Hurry up!
-Here you go.
One of those crazy desert cloudbursts.
What happened?
Gentlemen, I don't understand it.
That was enough water to detonate a dozen bombs.
-Boy that was tight, but I made it fit!
-Yeah.
All it takes is a little know-how.
Hey, what are you doing, swimming in a mirage?
-No, fellas, I was just standing there--
-Yeah, yeah, just standing there.
Well, stop standing there and climb aboard!
Climb aboard, all right, climb aboard.
Down with the hatch!
There's some kind of vehicle out there.
Gentlemen, someone has stolen the bomb!
Security! Security, this is an emergency, an emergency!
All right, now, men, hear this.
This is it.
Contact.
-Boy, what power!
-If the professor could see us now!
All because we cleaned a little sand out of the distributor.
Yeah.
-Talent shows.
-It does?
-Take over, I'll check the Fathometer.
-Okay.
-Hey, we're not doing too bad.
-Okay up there.
Hey, fellas, get a load of the news.
Officials of Los Amigos
Proving Grounds...
...were thrown into consternation when a new atomic depth charge...
...was mysteriously stolen from its test site seconds before being detonated.
-How do you like those crooks?
-Authorities warn...
...the tremendous destructive power of this bomb...
...will be unleashed at once on the slightest contact--
Can you imagine stealing an atom bomb?
It just shows you how stupid some people can get.
-Get away from there!
-All right.
-As you were!
-All right, I'm sorry.
-But it's disgusting, I'll say that.
-Yes, you are.
Not me, the people who stole the bomb, stupid.
We're flying!
A lake.
Full speed on the choppers!
We haven't gone underwater yet.
Let's try the submarine bit.
You lamebrain, you saw what happened with sand in the distributor.
What will happen with water in the carburetor?
-So, what could possibly happen?
-You could possibly get a busted skull!
All right, all right.
-We're flying!
-We're in the air!
-Blue water.
-Blue water.
Remember, keep your cotton-picking fingers off that orbit button.
-What do you think, I'm dumb?
-I don't think, I know.
Well, I don't think you know either.
As I was saying, keep your cotton- picking fingers off the orbit button.
-What do you think I am, dumb?
-I don't think, I know.
-Well, I don't think you know either.
-Come on.
Hey, didn't we just do that?
-Did you see what I just saw?
-A flying submarine?
-Flight 707 to Control--
-No, not a flying submarine.
-No, we didn't see it.
-No, no, no, we didn't see a thing.
I know the boys did their best, but it's plain...
...my machine wasn't ready after all.
I just hope they didn't injure themselves.
I guess Tom was right, maybe I am just an old crackpot.
-Oh, Father, it's not true.
-It is, Carol, it is.
As far as that flying buzz saw is concerned.
Not this camera, honey. This is gonna work just like I promised.
I'll make it up to them.
-Hi, professor!
-Hi, Carol!
-Boys, boys, am I glad to see you!
-We were so worried!
-I don't know what about.
-We got news for you.
We made a few minor adjustments, and your chariot spins like a top.
You can tell the Air Force to order another demonstration.
-We'll really show them something.
-In due time, due time, boys.
-Wait till you see the surprise I've got.
-Surprise?
Okay, professor, don't get excited.
Okay, what?
Well, here she is, fellas, all finished.
Hey, that's wonderful!
But will it work?
Certainly! Don't you have any confidence in the professor?
Don't forget, boys, this is the 10th, the day your contract expires.
-You've only got until 6:00 tonight.
-Six o'clock. By golly, he's right!
Don't worry, I'll get you under the wire.
We'll make a test film right now...
-...and rush it to the studio.
-You have things to do. I better get out of your way.
-Okay, Carol, good night.
-We'll see you.
Move this thing around and get some lamps. We'll need lots of lights.
-We'll put it right about here.
-Bring in that 10k over there, Larry.
Come over here and get yourself assembled in a position so I can....
Good, good!
Now we'll get some makeup...
...and you'll be all set here.
That's it. Very good.
-Oh, good. Yeah.
-Yeah, and now.... That's it.
-That's it. Good.
-Okay, professor.
Now, I'll get your special costumes.
Don't worry about the makeup.
It's a special quick-drying polyunsaturated titanium.
Well, if it's that quick-drying polyunsaturated titanium...
-...what have we got to worry about?
-You are very glib today, professor.
Well, thank you very much!
-What are you doing? Watch it.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, watch it--
That's it, the makeup. Just a little--
All right, all right, that's it.
Go ahead. Wait, a little bit under your eyebrows.
-Well, you take care of it, sir.
-There you are. There.
-Just a dash.
-Thank you. You are so kind.
Hi. Oh, Carol, please. Look, it's only fair to let the defense have its say.
-It seems to me you've had your say.
-I wanna make up for it.
-To you as well as to your father.
-My father's busy now.
Then I can explain it to you, and you can explain it to him.
It was utter chaos. I was nervous.
I mean, after all, a general with a....
Carol, listen.
That does it.
Now, how about a little act? Anything.
-I know something--
-How about the--?
Oh, sure! I got it, the thing they're all going daffy about!
-Got a radio, professor?
-Over there.
-Okay.
-Yeah, music, that's what we need.
What's the matter?
Are you killing ants?
-No, that's the latest dance step.
-Dance step?
-Sure.
-If you say so.
Good, good!
We're rolling!
Deadline is 6, remember. You can wash up in there. I'll wait in the car.
-Gotta change clothes too.
-Meet you at the studio.
-Okay, hurry now.
-You look funny.
All right, come on, you abominable snowman.
-Go in there.
-We'll get washed up--
-What a character.
-Cut it out.
Boy, it's gonna feel good to get out of this stuff.
-Stop clowning and talk English.
-Stop clowning and talk English.
It wasn't me. It was them guys.
-Who are those jokers?
-Why, they're actors.
Can't you see the makeup?
The professor probably hired them...
-...before we got here.
-Foreign actors.
-Well, you're too late, boys. Beat it.
-See your agent.
Get some of that off.
"Take the machine at once.
Destroy the Earth as you leave."
Destroy the Earth!
Give me the shovel.
Hey, Larry.
I knew you'd understand.
-Who are they?
-I don't know.
Come on, Joe, we gotta stop those Martians.
Yeah, they're gonna blow up the whole world.
Oh, they can't do that!
We won't get our social security.
Come on.
That gun wasn't there before.
-The boys! Moe!
-Larry!
Hold it!
-They're gonna shoot!
-Let's get out of here!
Not there!
Here!
What--?
Operator, get me Air Force headquarters, Los Angeles. Hurry!
But, Gen. Bixby,
I saw them with my own eyes.
They must be from outer space!
Now see here, Andrews.
Not content with wasting my time with that cockamamie washing machine...
...you have the colossal nerve to tell me it's been hijacked by Martians!
Send all available interceptors, alert all bases.
-An attack could come any moment!
-Attack, eh?
Whom are you trying to kid?
Good heavens!
Hello, operator?
Operator!
-Now the line is dead.
-Maybe Father can help.
Get me Washington, get the chief of staff!
That's right, this is a red alert!
Repeat, red alert!
That's right, scramble flights
6, 7, 8, 14 and 20!
I want every available plane in the air!
There's only one thing to do, men.
We've gotta get in and knock those freaks out.
We can't go in there.
They've got the space guns.
-Yeah, Larry's right, but I got an idea.
-Save it. I got a better idea.
We'll disable the engine, see?
Then this crate has to go down.
-Yeah.
-Come on.
-We got nothing to worry about now.
-That's what you think. Look!
Get out of there!
You almost got a cheap haircut.
Hey, fellas, no! We're with you!
We're on your side!
See, fellas! Look at that, they're going around, they're--
Look.
They're on the ground?
Turn it over to the Army!
Elements of the Army, Marines,
Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard...
...are being mobilized to shoot down the invaders attacking the city from the sky.
Civil defense authorities are warning all civilians to keep off the streets.
Oh, no, not Disneyland!
What are you doing out there?
The Air Force!
The Army!
Get those planes back in the air!
The Army!
The Army!
The Air Force!
Yeah, the Army!
The Air Force! The Army!
They are? You're sure?
Adm. Willoughby.
They're over the ocean now.
You're on.
Hey, fellas, look.
-Just like an atomic bomb.
-Atomic bomb, you idiot?
Everybody knows an atomic bomb makes a great big flash.
A big flash--
Didn't they say on the radio yesterday an atomic bomb was stolen from the desert?
That's right. So where did all this sudden power come from?
Are you sure you handed me a carburetor back there in the desert?
-Well, I had sand in my eye.
-You had sand in your brains too.
Come on, sandy, let's take a look.
Look, "AEC."
Automobile Exchange Company.
See, it's a rebuilt carburetor.
AEC is Atomic Energy Commission.
That's the bomb!
A bomb! Oh, Moe!
Moe, what are we gonna do?
What do you usually do when somebody mails you a bomb?
I mail it back.
You birdbrain, you dunk it in water and put it out of commission.
-Oh, right.
-Larry, go get the water.
-Sometimes I think you're dumb.
-Dumb? Well!
Fantastic! Incredible!
What do you say, Lansing?
-Oh, yes, yes, quite.
-Quite.
Son, this here new process is exactly what I've been looking for.
-I kind of thought you'd like it.
-Like it? I love it!
I'll double their salaries and give them a 10-year contract.
But they gotta be here on time, or it's no deal.
It's two minutes to 6 right now, G.G.
They won't make it.
I know them, they're off dilly-dallying somewhere.
-Hey, the cannon.
-Cannon?
If they ever hit those gasoline tanks, they'll blow the whole city up!
-Hurry up!
-I'll get them.
Oh, no! Larry, Moe, I'm stuck!
Help, help!
I'm stuck! Help!
-Hey, Moe, look!
-A periscope! I'll take care of that.
Take it easy, kid!
Give me that.
When I chop off this tower...
...it's gonna go down, so watch yourself.
--has just crashed into the sea off the California coast.
We repeat, the danger is over.
The machine carrying the invaders just exploded in the Pacific Ocean.
The invaders plummeted into the water...
...with a devastating explosion of atomic magnitude.
Navy sources report the huge mushroom cloud...
...is still visible for over 30 miles.
We repeat, the danger is over.
The machine carrying the invaders has exploded in the Pacific Ocean.
They'll never make it. Thirty seconds more and their contract expires.
Just in time!
Congratulations, boys!
I never thought you'd make it.
A promise is a promise.
-We said we'd drop in.
-On our heads?
If you can't lick them, join them!
Good morning.
Good morning, colonel.
Oh, hi, bill.
Well, did you make our reservations
For lunch at the club?
You and your easy living.
Boy, you better cut down on some of that weight
Or I'm going to ground you.
Oh, yeah?
Look who's talking.
You know, Marty, you're just jealous.
You're after my job, and I know it.
You know, you may be right.
Okay, hero, let's get you into your flight suit.
Right.
The flight is divided into three phases.
Ground to maximum altitude,
Maximum speed and controllability
In the upper thin air,
And re-entry.
Now, the turbo jet engine will lose its efficiency
At around 50,000 feet.
Allison will coast on it to 75,000 feet,
And then cut in the new rocket engine.
He'll level off at around 500,000 feet,
100 Miles above the earth, gentlemen.
For all practical purposes,
Major Allison will be in space.
Now, at this altitude,
He'll lower the ventral stabilizers
And make his high-speed stability flight
Progressing from position 1 to 20.
Now, we know the x80 is capable
Of a speed of 5,000 Miles per hour.
In the thin air of 100 Miles altitude
With no resistance, who knows?
What we learn from this flight will pretty well determine
Our next step into space,
The satellite,
A man in orbit.
You all set, major?
Yes, sir.
Excuse me gentlemen.
I'll join you in flight control shortly.
Hello, tracking station number two.
This is sands flight control.
X80 standing by for take-off.
With your permission, tower.
Am I clear to roll?
Weather clear.
You have a green light.
Good luck.
X80 to sands control.
Approaching altitude
40,000 feet,
Air speed 1,200,
Angle of flight 85 degrees.
Over.
50,000 feet, colonel.
Turbo power cutting out.
Hello, control.
Approaching 75,000 feet.
Cutting in rocket engine.
Hello, sands, this is x80,
Approaching altitude
400,000 feet.
Okay, colonel.
There's a new record for you.
Good work, Allison.
How do you feel?
How's she handling?
No pain, no strain.
Leveling off.
Proceeding with phase number two.
Over.
When you're ready, kid.
When you're ready.
This is x80 to sands control.
Approaching position number one.
Altitude 500,000.
Air speed 1,000-plus.
Ventral stabilizers in position.
You ready, colonel?
Ready any time you are.
And the lord be with you.
Over.
Sands control from x80.
Position number four.
Air speed 2,000...
Two, zero, zero, zero.
We're going all the way.
X80 to sands control.
Position number eight.
Air speed 6,000...
Six, zero, zero, zero.
Position ten.
Air speed 7,000.
- What is it, Martin?
- I'm not sure.
We've lost radio contact.
Colonel Martin, he's off the tracking field.
Keep trying.
Keep trying.
Sands control to x80,
Sands control to X, eight, oh.
Come in, x80.
Sands control to x80.
Sands to X, eight, oh.
Come in, x80.
Re-entry glide successful.
This is x80 preparing for a landing.
Are you reading me?
Come in, sands control.
Hey, anybody here?
Did you make our reservations for lunch at the club?
You and your easy living.
Boy, you better cut down on some of that weight
Or I'm going to ground you.
Oh, yeah?
Look who's talking.
You know, Marty, you're just jealous.
You're after my job, and I know it.
You know, you may be right.
Okay, hero, let's get you into your flight suit.
Right.
Where is everybody?
Hey!
Anybody here?
You.
Who are you?
What are you doing to me?
I said,
"what are you doing to me?"
Can't you hear me?
Get me out of this thing!
Who... who are you people?
Where am I?
In a hospital or something?
Where am I?
What's wrong with you?
Can't you understand me?
Say something.
I said, "answer me!"
Can't you...
Let go of me!
Oh, sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.
The new prisoner has been cleansed of radiation,
My master.
That is well.
Let us hope we find him more cooperative
Than the previous prisoners.
I hope Trirene has learned something
From his thoughts.
We must be very careful.
He will use all the known tricks.
We can depend on that.
We will proceed with the usual caution, captain.
Who are you?
Major William Allison,
U.S. air force.
Won't you sit down, major?
Sir, I'd like to ask some questions.
I'm very confused about what's happened to me.
Yes, of course, major.
Ask your questions.
I'd like to know where I am
And how I got here
And who all you people are.
And the airfield...
What has happened to it?
The air base, my supreme.
Yes.
I left there at 8:00 this morning,
And half hour later,
It was in shambles, deserted.
Where are colonel Martin and the others?
I... I don't understand.
You are from a nation of speaking peoples.
How glorious that must be.
Our society's less fortunate.
Your society?
Yes.
You see, we here in our citadel,
Save for my captain and myself,
Are deaf-mutes.
Even my own grandchild Trirene.
Deaf-mutes.
You mean everybody?
I don't understand.
There will be time for understanding
If you are cooperative.
Now tell us of your nation.
I don't know what you're talking about, sir.
I'm sorry.
You know very well what we're talking about.
You're not the first spy we've ever captured.
What do you mean spy?
I asked some civil questions.
I expect some civil answers.
I want some answers.
What is this you're wearing, this symbol?
What is this?
New devices to deceive us, master.
We have seen such guises before.
They do not fool us.
It would be wise to tell us all you know.
I'm major William Allison,
United States air force, sir.
Serial number 03564629.
That's all I'm required to tell you.
I will use other measures, supreme.
I will get to the truth.
Wait, captain.
Major, we have saved your life.
You could have been captured by the mutants.
Won't you cooperate with us?
With your permission, sir.
What was your purpose in coming here?
I don't have any purpose.
You lie.
You were spying on our solar energy installation.
How did you find us?
Find you?
I don't even know where I am.
You're searching for
Karl Kruse and Dr. Bourman.
You're one of them, aren't you?
I never heard of them.
Where are your people living?
Would you really like to know, captain?
Yes, of course I want to know.
Well, at this very minute,
I don't know myself.
Captain...
He's impossible.
You're one of the scapes.
Admit it.
I'm an officer of the United States air force.
I'd like someone to tell me something that makes some sense.
Other nations, mutants?
What kind of talk is this?
He is very clever, my supreme, but I have a plan.
I can use him to our advantage.
Trirene does not approve of your plan, captain.
She has found some truth in the major's thoughts.
I do not trust him, especially his thoughts.
Even Trirene could be deceived.
Follow through with your plan, captain.
Yes, master.
It will be done.
Wait a minute.
Let me go.
What are you doing?
It appears you have more than the usual interest
In this young captive,
Trirene.
He's very young.
This young man is an enemy.
You must be very careful.
I understand your wish, Trirene.
We see you, captain.
We see you up there.
Captain is alone.
Who are you?
I can't see you.
Good lord.
What's wrong with you?
We will kill you, captain.
Mutants.
I'm not the captain.
Do you understand?
Who are you?
You can talk.
Answer me!
Yes!
I will talk.
Stay or I'll break his arm.
Now, the captain and his people are your enemies.
Why?
They are listening.
They are listening and watching us.
I don't care.
I want some answers.
Who are these people in this citadel?
They are hiding from us.
They have food.
They have everything.
But we will find them, all of them,
And kill, kill, kill them.
Why are they hiding?
They are infected too.
They cannot escape.
Escape?
Escape from what?
You are scape, like Karl Kruse.
Who are the scapes?
You.
You and Kruse.
You are scapes.
We know.
You left us to die.
You ran from the plague.
What plague?
When?
Long ago.
Long ago you left us here to die.
You did this to us.
But we will find your hiding place,
And we will kill all of you.
I did this?
Has the whole world gone mad?
Young man, my granddaughter has chosen to protect you.
She has expressed faith in what you've told us.
My captain and I will trust her judgment.
Trirene has a gift we do not possess.
She has an extra sensory power.
She's able to perceive every thought within our minds.
Go with her, young man.
You will have the freedom of our citadel.
And our child will be happy.
Oh, thank you.
Uh, thank you.
Hey, am I starved.
That looks great.
Uh, thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, hi.
I was just looking around.
I mean, Trirene,
I want to thank you for rescuing me.
But, you know, that captain seems determined
That I'm an enemy.
If you could only talk,
If I could only make you understand.
I'll go out of my mind if I...
You know what I'm thinking, don't you?
You know how important it is to me
To find out exactly what happened
And how I got here.
The city.
You and all the people here once lived in this city.
Is that right?
No?
Oh, your grandfather, the supreme,
He lived in the city.
I see.
Your father?
And your mother.
They came here before you were born?
And you've never lived in the air and sunlight, have you?
Trirene, tell me.
Why did they abandon that city
And move to the subterranean world?
The mutants.
The plague.
Was it the plague they told me about?
Trirene, try to understand this.
I was on an airfield this morning.
In less than an hour, everything had changed.
All the people I know were gone.
There was no plague where I came from.
What happened?
What happened to your father and mother?
The mutants killed them.
Oh, I'm...
I'm very sorry.
You know my thoughts before
I express them, so...
You know I'm going to ask you about Karl Kruse.
Is he here in the citadel?
Look, would you take me to him?
I think if I can get to Karl Kruse,
He can help me understand all this.
Trirene gives me to understand that you are one of us.
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
I think you are.
How long have you been here in the citadel?
Since this morning.
Well, I'm not certain.
I don't know.
I've lost track.
Time has very little meaning
Here in the catalisosphere.
Trirene informs me that you have been here
For three turns of the earth.
That is three days.
I've only been in this place a few hours.
I took off from the field at 0800 this morning.
I had hoped that you would be able to explain...
Do not excite yourself.
We will explain.
There will be plenty of time.
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Karl Kruse.
Used to be general Karl Kruse.
This is Professor Bourman.
How do you do?
Major William Allison,
United States air force.
Did you say
United States air force?
Yes.
What's so unusual about that?
Major Allison, what year was your flight in?
I told you today, this morning.
But what day and what year, major?
It is important we know.
March 5, 1960.
He's from before the plague.
How is this possible, Professor?
What is this plague
I keep hearing about?
You really don't know, do you?
No, I don't know.
I don't know where
I am or how I got here,
And I don't know who these people are
In the citadel either.
Well, Trirene has found herself
A big, good-looking playmate, and a fiery one too.
Major Allison, this is ex-captain Markova.
I don't know that I like what you have on your mind, captain.
Maybe when you find out what she has on hers,
You'll like that better.
What are you driving at?
They've given you the run of this place,
Haven't they?
Yes.
So little Trirene here can get busy and...
What kind of female are you?
I had to do it.
Don't you understand?
You mean she was reading your thoughts,
Things you didn't want her to know?
That's right.
We can talk now, but not for long.
The captain will be up here any minute
To see what's happened to his gadgets.
Watch out for him.
He rules this place with an iron fist.
Yes, so I've found out.
He's determined
I'm an enemy spy,
A "scape," he called it.
That's the name they have given us,
We who escaped the cosmic plague.
They hate us for leaving them behind.
Luckily, we convinced them they needed us.
Otherwise, we'd still be down in the pit with the mutants.
We keep the solar power system operating.
All their skilled have died off.
And the mutants are the ones who did not escape the plague.
Is that right?
No, the people here in this citadel didn't either.
They are all first-stage mutants themselves.
Is that why they're deaf and mute?
And sterile, except for Trirene perhaps.
Sterile?
Yes.
They are a dying race.
There hasn't been a new birth on this citadel
For the past 20 years.
That's where you fit into the plan, Allison.
Make no mistake about it.
What do you mean?
Regeneration.
Trirene has chosen you as her mate.
You're the last hope for this society.
I don't understand it.
There wasn't any plague this morning.
When did it happen?
Major Allison, have you any idea
What year this is right here, right now?
Of course I know what year it is.
What's that got to do with it?
Everything.
Major, this is 2024.
It's what?
64 years into the future for you, major.
The plague we are talking about,
It hadn't happened in your world in 1960.
It began in 1971.
Wh...
Atomic war?
No, no.
The feared nuclear war never occurred.
When man set foot on the moon,
All nations started to work together to push on into space.
By 1970, colonies had been established
On both Mars and Venus.
Then if it wasn't nuclear war, what did cause it?
A bombardment of cosmic radiation from outer space.
Bombardment from outer space?
Oh, now, wait a minute.
You wait.
Now, listen to me, Allison.
The people of your world are concerned about nuclear fallout.
Well, the danger is in the other extreme.
The tons of radioactive dust that have mushroomed
Up into the ionosphere since the very first a-bomb test,
That dust has remained up there,
And it's slowly destroying the protective screen
That has filtered deadly cosmic rays from space
Since time began.
Do you understand, major?
Yes.
That all the nuclear explosions
That have ever taken place on earth have contributed to this.
Yes.
And every human being left has become mutant
Or sterile or a combination of both.
If what you say is true,
Then colonel Martin and all the others were caught up in it.
What's happened to them?
How can I find out?
There isn't any way.
Let's only hope they were amongst the lucky ones
Who could evacuate.
Evacuate?
Yes.
In 1973, the Mars evacuation began
To the planet colonies.
Only the uninfected ones were permitted to go.
The ones left behind moved underground
As fast as possible and started building
Networks of tunnels like this one.
More than half the population of the world was wiped out
During the first year.
I see.
When I landed on the air base,
It was completely destroyed,
Demolished, deserted.
You landed?
You didn't crash?
The captain.
When they found you, they destroyed your ship.
No.
No, I left the air base.
They captured me afterwards.
Then your plane is in operating condition
Sitting out there on the air base?
Well, I suppose so.
Unless the mutants have found it.
Well, Kruse,
I see you've become acquainted
With our new prisoner.
Yes, captain,
And it is your good fortune, as well as ours.
Major Allison has an excellent technical background,
And he's eager to help us.
And as you know, captain,
We are in dire need of skilled help.
Well, we shall see.
Where's Trirene?
I believe she's returned to her chambers, captain.
I think she's expecting a visitor.
Come along with me, major.
We have some things to discuss.
Kruse, I'm warning you.
I'll tolerate no more of your scheming.
If you persist, I'll see that you're back in the dungeon.
We've got to get to the major before they convince him
We're his enemies.
But unfortunately,
I do not understand such things.
I am not a scientist.
My concern is a military one.
I must save the last of my people.
Then it is true.
Your society is doomed.
Major Allison,
I must warn you.
Karl Kruse and his group are shrewd.
They'll use you.
They're the most dangerous scapes
I've ever encountered.
It would be wise for you not to associate with them.
Come, I'll show you your chambers.
Major, I must tell you the truth.
Understand it's not an easy thing for me to do.
What they say about us is true.
We are sick and dying.
You cannot imagine what the envy that I look upon you,
Kruse, and Dr. Bourman.
I, myself, am in the first stages of mutation.
You?
For this reason,
I have no love for you who have escaped the plague.
But as the supreme has told you,
We will trust in Trirene's judgment.
Major Allison, I ask you,
Do nothing that will bring harm to her,
For Trirene is our only hope.
Trirene.
Trirene.
Trirene, I want to talk to you.
Look, I'm very sorry about the things Markova said to you.
I don't believe any of the things they told me.
You know I'm telling the truth, don't you?
You know, you're very lovely.
I keep forgetting you read my thoughts.
I wish you couldn't.
What can I say?
You're not angry?
You know, you have an unfair advantage over every man.
What are you doing here?
Take it easy.
Don't you think I know what will happen to me
If I'm caught?
You were spying on us.
Don't be foolish.
I couldn't care less.
Come here.
I better get back.
Wait.
Kruse has to see you.
He has a plan.
I don't know whether
I better be seeing any of you or not.
We may be able to get you out of this
And back to your own time.
How can I possibly go back to my own time
If I don't know how I got here?
You don't, but Kruse and Bourman do.
Look, why should it be me?
Why not Kruse or Bourman
Or even you, Markova?
There'd be nothing to be gained
By our returning to our time.
It's different with you.
You're from before the plague.
You may be able to...
I may be able to prevent it.
Is that what you mean?
Of course.
You've got to take this chance.
If you can get back to your people and prevent the plague,
All this will never happen.
Let's go talk to Kruse and Bourman.
Yes, I agree.
I have to get back to my time, to 1960.
Well, we have a very good chance, major,
If we can reverse the phenomenon that brought you here.
What phenomenon did bring me here?
It is what we know as a relativity paradox.
It's another dimension...
A fifth dimension.
Fifth dimension?
Professor Bourman's principle of gravitation propulsion
Brought it about.
By 1970, it became the standard system
Used to travel to the planets at the speed of light.
Speed of light?
I thought 10,000 Miles an hour was fast.
Yes, but there is a pitfall in the system.
At speeds approaching that of light,
It is possible to break the time lock,
The barrier that holds all things
In a normal time relationship to each other.
That's what happened to all of us.
We have slipped out of one time sphere and into another.
Captain Markova broke through in 1973 during her third flight.
She was transporting supply from central Europe
To the Venus planet.
The captain's men destroyed her ship.
It happened to Kruse and I years later.
We had returned to earth for an observation flight in 1994.
Our ship crashed.
But the speed I approached in the x80
Was nowhere near the speed of light.
That may be, but it was just enough
To create certain mathematical conditions.
Let me show you.
Here.
These symbols represent
The earth, the sun,
And your ship.
Now, consider these known facts.
The earth is rotating at 1,000 Miles per hour,
But it is also revolving in orbit around the sun
At 66,000 Miles per hour.
Time, as we know it, is relative to these movements.
But the entire solar system,
Together with other systems of our galaxy,
Are moving through space at over 6 million Miles per hour.
Theoretically, you were at a velocity
Approaching the speed of light
Before you ever left the ground.
Yes, but everything is moving at that speed
Together as one unit...
The air, the earth...
According to the law of gravity.
Time is not affected by the laws of gravity.
This is what happened to you.
At some point during your high-speed flight,
You approached escape velocity,
25,000 Miles per hour.
It was at this time that you altered your flight angle.
If you hadn't, probably you would have gone on into orbit.
It was this angle at a specific altitude
And velocity that broke the time barrier.
For a fraction of a second, you were suspended in space,
No longer interlocked with the time spheres
Of the sun and the earth.
Now, during this split second,
Our galaxy moved onward in time
For what amounted to 65 years.
An instant later, you had re-joined our solar system.
And the rest you know.
Yes.
Then if I repeat the altitude, angle of flight, and speed
In directly the opposite direction,
I should go back into time
65 years.
Mm-hmm.
Precisely.
Dr. Bourman is working on the formula.
The three factors must be exact.
And we must locate an escape from the citadel
So I can find my ship.
Right.
We must obtain an early map of the citadel
With the tunnel work.
Your air base surely must be included.
They began construction as early as 1972.
The maps are on file in the supreme's chamber.
There is only one way to get them, major.
You mean Trirene?
That's the only way.
No.
No, I won't turn her against her own people.
You have to do it.
It's up to you, major.
You haven't much time to decide.
Very well.
I'll do it.
You stay here.
I'll find my way back.
Trirene, I've got to have your help.
It's very difficult for me to know what to do,
But there's something...
What would I do without you?
Trirene, tell me you know
I'm doing the right thing.
I've got to try and go back.
You do understand that, don't you?
There won't have to be any citadel.
You and your people can live on the surface of the earth
Without fear of any cosmic plague.
They're waiting.
I made this tracing from the original map,
Then Trirene returned it to the archives.
Here, let me show you.
Now, here's the citadel.
I remember a wooded area and a hill.
The solar antenna was atop the hill.
They must have hit me with that paralyzing ray about here.
This outlet must be perimeter 22b.
Here's the highway.
If I can find that,
I can follow it directly to the air base.
We'll need the gun we have hidden.
And your flight suit.
Yes.
What about the time lock formula?
I'm working on it now.
I'm almost finished.
If nothing goes wrong,
Allison,
You can be on your way within a few hours.
It should be no great problem.
Trirene will lead us by the guards.
Good.
No, it is not the equipment, master.
It's another one of their devices
To prevent us from watching them.
They're planning an escape, and I know it.
I'll put a stop to this scheme.
Just say the word.
They will only try again.
Trirene's helping them.
I fear our future is done, captain.
We have returned to the cave
Where men first lived on earth.
We have returned to our birthplace to die.
Through Allison and Trirene, there is hope, master.
Perhaps it is too great a hope.
There may be some truth in what they say,
Some chance that this young man can return
To a time before the plague.
No, it's a trick.
We must not let the major escape.
Do not forget, master,
Our observers sighted mutant scouts again yesterday.
This is a time for great caution.
I will speak to him.
Perhaps I can persuade him to accept our way.
Yes, my supreme.
Let me bring him to you.
What's the meaning of this?
Don't ask me questions.
The supreme and I trusted you.
We're aware of your scheme.
I could explain to you forever.
You'd never understand.
I warned you to stay away from those three.
Now you'll answer to the supreme.
Then you don't believe it's possible for me
To return to my own time?
Kruse and Bourman think the plague can be prevented
If I can go back and inform my people.
I truly wish I could believe your reasoning,
But they are using you for their own purpose.
They will bring others.
They will destroy our citadel.
But you don't understand.
I'm from a time before any of this has ever happened.
I must go back.
Such things do not exist.
Kruse has created these illusions in your mind.
Look, as far as I'm concerned, it's 1960.
You people can believe it's 2024
Or any time you please.
None of this is real.
It's all an illusion to me.
No, my son.
You're wrong.
Here, touch my hand.
Is that not real flesh?
And these walls, are they not solid stone?
And Trirene, you have touched her.
Can you say she's not real?
Yes, they are all very real things.
But you can't prove that what you say is true.
The only proof I can offer
Is the fact that here we are in this room.
Can you prove that you are somewhere else?
Supreme,
Trirene believes in what
I'm trying to do.
You have faith in her judgment, haven't you?
Yes, but Trirene has fallen in love.
Please, I ask you,
Give up this futile scheme.
Remain here.
You will inherit our domain.
I'm sorry.
I value my freedom more than this.
Hear me, fellow prisoners!
Hear me, fellow prisoners.
You're free.
The citadel is yours.
Hear me, mutants.
Come out of your pit of death.
Our time of vengeance has come.
Follow me, soldiers of revenge.
I'll lead you to the captain,
To food, to freedom!
So you'll attempt this escape,
Even though we'll try and stop you?
Yes.
I'll try to escape,
Even though the captain offers all resistance.
You will never leave the citadel alive.
Well, that's a chance
I'll have to take.
I didn't think for one minute
The supreme would change your mind.
Now you're my responsibility,
And I'm going to take charge.
You're going back to the pit.
They'll tear them to pieces.
Are you out of your mind?
You set them free.
It's part of the plan.
Get to your room for your flying suit.
Move.
Where are Kruse and Bourman?
We're meeting them at the elevator up.
You better go in and get Trirene.
We don't need her anymore.
The citadel's in chaos.
The guards are involved in that.
You don't think I'd leave her here to face this, do you?
I'm taking her with me.
You can't, Allison.
You can't take her back with you.
I'll try.
Don't you understand?
You can't take her back through the time barrier with you.
Your world is before she was born.
I'll try anyway.
No.
From now on it's you and me.
I'm going back to the time barrier with you.
I'm going back to my time, 1973.
The formula.
You're double crossing Kruse and Bourman.
Not for long.
Leave her, major.
There's no time.
Come on.
We are in luck.
The guards are being withdrawn.
What are you doing?
I had to do it.
Because, you see,
He would have killed us all.
Like Markova, he wanted to take your plane, Allison.
I think you're lying Bourman.
I think you're the one that wanted to make that flight.
That will be all, major Allison.
Supreme was right about you and Kruse.
Because we wanted to return to 1994?
Yes.
You said I could prevent the cosmic plague
If I could go back.
You could, but your people won't believe you.
This is mass murder.
You're letting these people die.
I will never break through the barrier in 2024 again.
I will never know anything about it.
Get out of your flight suit,
Allison.
You'll have to take it off me.
Trirene.
I'm sorry.
We're going back to my world.
We're free now.
I understand.
I'll take you to your grandfather.
Now the shadow of death
Darkens the holes of our citadel.
Our bright ray of hope is gone.
It is the end of us.
No.
No, it's not the end.
As long as we believe, there is always hope.
I'll return to my time, to my people.
We will prevent the plague.
You'll not live in a world of darkness.
I pray that this you believe in is not a dream.
No, it isn't.
I promise you.
I believe in you.
I'll lead you safely to the surface.
I believe.
Sands control to x80.
Sands to X, eight, oh.
Come in, x80.
Hello, sands.
This is x80.
I'm in serious trouble.
Coming in for a landing.
Are you reading me?
Alert all crash detail to stand by.
What room is he in, sergeant?
Operating room two, sir.
How is he?
I haven't...
Good lord!
What's happened to him, doctor?
What could have caused this?
I don't know.
I have no explanation.
Not one word of this to anybody.
Keep me informed, doctor.
I'll be in my office.
All right, colonel.
Call the duty officer, sergeant.
I want a guard posted outside this door.
This is now a restricted area.
Yes, sir.
This is the office of the chief of staff.
Connect me with secretary
Lloyd Patterson's office.
Urgent.
Trirene was dead.
The supreme gave me her ring.
He showed me the way out of the citadel.
I got to my plane.
That's all I remember.
30 minutes later,
Allison brought the ship in
For an emergency landing.
Now, the odd thing about it is this...
Right after he reported in at position six...
Major Allison is feeling much better.
Good.
Mr. secretary, general, as you know,
Bill Allison is our leading research pilot
Here at the test center.
We've always considered him fully competent and rational.
Dr. Richman and I have been with him
For the past eight hours.
Dr. Richman and I are convinced
That he is as mentally sound right now
As any normal, well-balanced person can be.
I suggest we go in.
Mr. secretary, general.
Mr. secretary.
Thank you.
How about it, kid?
Feel like talking?
I'm ready, colonel.
Now, if you feel like you need more room,
Just say so.
Yeah, okay.
Any questions, gentlemen?
Mr. Patterson?
No, I don't believe so.
The plague, the cosmic plague.
None of us should go through it.
We've got to prevent it.
Prevent what, son?
The cosmic plague.
Marty, we've got to stop it!
Mr. secretary, from intelligence.
They've run a check on
Professor Bourman
And Karl Kruse.
Kruse is enrolled in a west German university.
He's a leading student in astronautics.
And Bourman, another student of physics and mathematics
In Amsterdam.
He's written papers on new propulsion systems
That have astounded the scientific world.
Colonel Martin...
This is Trirene's ring the supreme gave me.
Gentlemen,
We have got a lot to think about.

{16890}{17032}The air currents are bad here.|Helicopters can't fly to the valley.
{17070}{17222}The only way is over the bridge and|through the mountain trail.
{18399}{18440}There it is.
{18717}{18763}What is it?
{18777}{18869}It's supposed to point to the south-east.
{18874}{18940}That's because the sun is there.
{18941}{19000}My compass points north.
{19004}{19054}Must be a cheap compass.
{19116}{19180}What? Mine is the same.
{19188}{19252}What does it mean?
{19786}{19852}Professor, there it is!
{20949}{21017}It's so impressive!
{21353}{21405}Let's camp here.
{21410}{21447}Unload your rucksacks.
{21710}{21765}We can get water there.
{22148}{22216}When is the princess arriving?
{22232}{22270}Forget it.
{22276}{22315}Why's that?
{22324}{22411}Her plane exploded in mid-air.
{22439}{22530}Exploded? Was it the work of the assassins?
{22537}{22568}We don't know.
{22576}{22626}Any clues?
{22629}{22740}Not even the Foreign Ministry has any clues.
{22896}{23024}It's tragic that she should become the|victim of a power struggle isn't it.
{23042}{23072}Here.
{23141}{23320}"But you must admit some strange|things have occured lately."
{23494}{23530}Hey, Naoko!
{23555}{23608}- Hot news!|- Hot news?
{23614}{23649}A prophet has appeared.
{23649}{23685}- A prophet?|- Right.
{23691}{23799}Great stuff for 'Myths Of|The 20th Century'. Go now!
{23810}{23945}Here. Take these two tapes to Central Park.
{23992}{24037}Everyone!
{24049}{24187}Everyone! Have you ever thought|about the expanding universe?
{24217}{24459}The time has come for all Earth people to awaken|to their duties as citizens of the universe.
{24467}{24533}Are you a boy or a girl?
{24538}{24593}Do a striptease!
{24733}{24806}She suffers from megalomania.
{24812}{24933}No wonder. We're having a heatwave|instead of snow this winter.
{24949}{25079}The Earth is on the brink of destruction.
{25108}{25264}But you still refuse to take me seriously.
{25272}{25302}Listen to me!
{25480}{25543}Where are you from?
{25680}{25790}Space? Aren't you Japanese?
{25831}{25902}I come from Jupiter.
{25957}{26030}Is Jupiter in Africa?
{26066}{26117}Jupiter is up in the sky.
{26178}{26213}Are you?
{26216}{26342}So one can travel in space now? We should go.
{26416}{26542}You were talking about the destruction of the Earth.
{26607}{26730}First, a diaster will occur at Mount Aso.
{27479}{27636}I don't think Mt. Aso has suddenly|become more active.
{27650}{27721}Nothing will happen there.
{27757}{27988}Whether she's from Jupiter or not, her|predictions are totally unfounded.
{28414}{28471}Thanks.
{28512}{28562}Thank you very much.
{29209}{29227}I'm back.
{29238}{29323}Welcome. Naoko's just home.
{29337}{29404}I think she has a new boyfriend.
{29407}{29440}You think so?
{29441}{29495}No, it's just a hunch.
{29499}{29560}That's alright then.
{29621}{29689}Welcome home. You're home early.
{29695}{29770}- I saw something very interesting.|- What?
{29775}{29872}Girl falling for a man with a nice car. Who is he?
{29890}{30016}Oh, him! Don't be so rude about Professor Murai.
{30032}{30118}Is Professor Murai your boyfriend?
{30177}{30297}No way. He's a professor at the university.
{30303}{30334}That's nice.
{30396}{30547}Mother, Professor Murai has been to the mountains.
{30555}{30701}He's investigating the meteorite. He told me about it.
{30712}{30830}It's a very strange meteorite. Look.
{30839}{30916}'Myths Of The 20th Century' again?
{30937}{31029}You're always talking about work.
{31063}{31196}I need to get lots of stories|before the programme starts.
{31340}{31405}Turn to Channel 7.
{31407}{31430}The news.
{31433}{31560}It's mothers favourite programme.|It's for housewives, but funny.
{31586}{31601}Hey!
{31610}{31693}Keep mother happy.
{31718}{31792}"We present 'What Are They Doing Now?'"
{32035}{32159}Ladies and gentlemen, welcome|to 'What Are They Doing Now?".
{32166}{32208}The programme which...
{32212}{32464}...give the public the opportunity to meet|the celebrities who have caused a stir in the past.
{32469}{32516}Now to make their request...
{32516}{32558}Here are our first guests.
{32612}{32720}A couple of nice little boys. Come here.
{32851}{32882}How old are you?
{32887}{32918}Five.
{32923}{33031}How cute! He's the same height as you.
{33052}{33094}Cut it out.
{33114}{33219}Now, who would you like to see again?
{33225}{33254}Mothra!
{33393}{33493}Now that's a surprise! Not easy to arrange.
{33496}{33522}Impossible?
{33530}{33626}No... but Mothra...
{33630}{33660}Liar!
{33728}{33793}I never tell lies.
{33795}{33839}Why not call the fairies?
{33848}{34012}They live with Mothra on Infant Island. Here they are!
{34786}{34961}I believe you all know these pretty little fairies.
{34967}{35067}They live with Mothra on Infant Island.
{35082}{35202}Good evening everyone.|Good evening, boys.
{35207}{35244}Good evening.
{35253}{35362}You wanted to ask about Mothra. Go ahead.
{35369}{35400}Big sisters.
{35402}{35454}Yes, what is it?
{35468}{35526}How are the Mothras?
{35532}{35628}Thank you. However, one of them is dead.
{35635}{35693}And the other?
{35697}{35857}He's fine. He's still a baby, but keeps peace on the island.
{35864}{35918}Would you like to see him?
{35956}{36033}Then we'll sing his song.
{36039}{36173}Shut your eyes and you'll see Mothra.
{36180}{36236}Shut your eyes.
{40131}{40209}This would make a good story. Don't you think?
{40228}{40272}Not interested.
{40279}{40405}Big brother, you must have a dream, otherwise...
{40413}{40474}He thinks everyone is a thief.
{40543}{40593}Leave her alone.
{40610}{40717}Think about your age. You're behaving like children.
{40862}{40920}"PROPHET PREDICTS DIASTER"
{41289}{41325}You sent for me, sir?
{41385}{41426}Look at this.
{41586}{41761}Latest news from Japan. Are you|sure the princess' plane was destroyed?
{41790}{41850}I'm positive. I swear.
{41858}{41938}Then why is she in the paper?
{41991}{42041}This is impossible.
{42083}{42186}This girl is not wearing the royal bracelet.
{42254}{42352}It could be anyone in this picture.
{42355}{42490}Go to Japan immediately and find out.
{42497}{42600}I will. And if she is the princess?
{42604}{42656}Kill her of course.
{42705}{42815}And if you fail, you'll be killed.
{42867}{42889}Go!
{42921}{43094}We've decided to make a|programme about this Jupiter girl.
{43104}{43244}Especially her predictions for the future.
{43256}{43355}That should make an interesting programme.
{43381}{43469}Does that mean the previous stories|will be shelved?
{43477}{43526}I didn't mean that.
{43535}{43628}But we'll start the series with|the girl from Jupiter.
{43641}{43723}But, we don't know where she is.
{43729}{43851}Then go and find her. You have eyes and legs.
{43878}{43931}What do you think?
{44024}{44133}I think it should be an exclusive.
{44139}{44170}That's right.
{44233}{44371}She always appears among the|crowds. Look for her there.
{44438}{44495}She looks very similar.
{44505}{44749}But, the ambassador said the Princess of Selgina|wears a bracelet on her arm.
{44763}{44882}Maybe that's why she's in disguise|and says such silly things.
{44891}{44976}To hide from the assassins.
{45031}{45064}We must protect her.
{45076}{45245}We don't have the authority.|Legally, we can't do anything.
{45267}{45396}Chief, let me do it. I can't|stand this situation.
{45427}{45516}OK, but you'll have to do it alone.
{45703}{45812}I'm in Shibuya. Haven't seen her yet.
{45817}{45902}No sign of her anywhere else?
{45919}{46030}OK, I'll call you later. Bye.
{46086}{46157}Brother! Are you loafing?
{46171}{46208}I'm not like you.
{46213}{46272}Why, I'm pursuing someone.
{46276}{46358}That's not very ladylike.|Want to get a drink?
{46362}{46461}OK. I'm waiting for someone.
{46691}{46719}Not here yet?
{46723}{46859}No. You have ten minutes. Then pay and buzz off.
{46867}{46914}I'm not paying.
{46944}{46991}Sorry, I was talking to her.
{47002}{47039}What will you have?
{47043}{47065}Blue Mountain.
{47073}{47105}Blue Mountain, please.
{47159}{47202}Who are you pursuing?
{47206}{47301}I can't reveal our plan...|not even to my brother.
{47329}{47374}Sorry I'm late.
{47431}{47464}May I sit down?
{47470}{47542}Please! This is my brother.
{47546}{47601}I'm Professor Murai, Geological Institute.
{47607}{47635}Nice to meet you.
{47650}{47755}My brother thinks you're my boyfriend.
{47755}{47796}Oi, shut up!
{47806}{47839}My pleasure.
{47842}{47906}You look like you're on duty.
{47912}{47980}I'm going to the mountain again.
{47989}{48042}To investigate the meteorite?
{48050}{48089}Did you find anything?
{48098}{48193}We've discovered it has a strange attraction.
{48206}{48307}A kind of magnetism or gravity.
{48319}{48373}Just right for 'Myths Of The 20th Century'.
{48381}{48402}Blue Mountain.
{48425}{48514}More interesting than the girl from Jupiter.
{48526}{48733}"The prophet from Jupiter appeared|yesterday on the crater of Mount Aso..."
{48738}{48811}"...warning sightseers to stay away."
{49134}{49230}Everyone, please listen to me.
{49239}{49479}Leave the volcano immediately. You are not aware|of the danger your are in. Please leave.
{49483}{49531}Is it going to erupt?
{49540}{49610}I'm not talking about eruption.
{49626}{49764}Inside the crater, Rodan is reviving.
{49826}{49890}I'm scared. Let's go home.
{49899}{50012}Don't listen to her, she's crazy.|I'm here with you.
{50291}{50333}You've lost it now.
{50339}{50430}I gave it to you. I don't want you to lose it.
{50447}{50515}I can't go down there.
{50541}{50689}I'll get it for you! 700 Yen!
{50747}{50792}No, 500 Yen.
{50821}{50891}All right, how about 200?
{50933}{50960}It's a deal.
{50964}{50989}Good.
{51210}{51293}Stop! Come back here!
{51346}{51431}Shut up, crackpot! You'll ruin my business.
{51496}{51528}Come back here!
{52403}{52443}Help me!
{52462}{52497}Help me!
{55694}{55758}Nobody knows we're here?
{55763}{55843}No. I've reserved a quiet hotel.
{55845}{55977}Good. Where is the princess?|No, I mean the prophet.
{55988}{56102}She's been missing since Rodan revived.|But she'll be back.
{56113}{56172}Are the police looking for her?
{56178}{56273}They're too busy to bother with her.
{56315}{56438}"Police have evacuated the area around Mount Aso."
{56445}{56550}"All climbers and sightseers must stay away."
{56575}{56772}"Police are also warning that the|meteorite in Kasumizawa might explode."
{56780}{56909}"Only the research party are allowed on the mountain."
{56917}{56985}"The public must stay away."
{57032}{57060}I'm going.
{57073}{57100}Wait a minute.
{57125}{57219}Professor, the light is getting brighter.
{57226}{57330}How strange. There is no magnetism today.
{57567}{57645}We shouldn't ignore the signs.
{57660}{57720}We should get out of here.
{57723}{57818}This is our only opportunity.
{57864}{57960}Aren't you interested in extra-terrestrial objects?
{57966}{58103}Of course. But my interest is losing out to my fear.
{58110}{58220}Professor, it seems to be growing.
{58228}{58306}Meteorites don't inflate like a balloon.
{58314}{58358}Let's investigate.
{58685}{58770}Anything to say before you leave?
{58781}{58899}We thank you all. We're going back to Infant Island.
{58918}{58999}If we call you again, will you come?
{59015}{59066}With pleasure.
{59075}{59189}But, we wish you'd receive us without a fanfare.
{59195}{59264}What do you think about Rodan?
{59266}{59352}Can you tell us where he is?
{59420}{59536}Our telepathic powers can't prophesy.
{59559}{59637}But Rodan will appear again soon.
{59801}{59857}Everybody, goodbye.
{59865}{59923}This ship must not sail.
{59968}{60016}It must not sail.
{60029}{60064}The girl from Jupiter!
{60125}{60196}Captain, the prophet is on board.
{60200}{60284}What? I didn't give authorisation.
{60289}{60331}She says not to sail.
{60336}{60413}I give the orders. Get rid of her.
{60430}{60585}Why can't you understand?|This ship must not sail.
{60596}{60639}Come with me.
{60646}{60684}Who are you?
{60689}{60729}A friend.
{60734}{60797}Excuse me, let me through.
{60811}{60857}Get off the ship.
{60858}{60973}Wait, I'll take her with me.
{60977}{61034}Naoko, wait!
{61206}{61259}Chief, I've found it!
{61266}{61310}She's the princess.
{61314}{61333}What?
{61633}{61673}How did you get it?
{61683}{61729}A man was trying to sell it.
{62215}{62255}Where did you get this?
{62267}{62415}I didn't steal it. I'm an honest fisherman.
{62437}{62515}I just want to know how you go it?
{62517}{62658}I swapped it for my cap, jumper and trousers.
{62692}{62725}Where?
{62743}{62810}At sea, that's the truth.
{62825}{62853}At sea?
{62861}{63019}On my way back from fishing,|I found a girl adrift.
{63023}{63177}I only wanted to help her, that's the honest truth.
{63185}{63224}Didn't you suspect her?
{63238}{63490}I meant to take her to the police as soon as we|got into harbour, but she was already gone by then.
{63632}{63715}Which is the one with the bracelet?
{63909}{63965}That's my cap!
{63974}{64079}She's the one I met at sea. That one too.
{64195}{64264}You'll stay here. Take him.
{64281}{64326}I didn't steal it.
{64331}{64422}We just need a statement.
{64606}{64665}Chief, What do you think?
{64734}{64860}Well, she was in the plane that exploded in mid-air.
{64879}{64960}How could she survive?
{64970}{65014}You don't believe it?
{65023}{65101}Children don't either. What about you?
{65107}{65244}I don't know. I've asked a lot of people, no one believe it.
{65261}{65347}But the UFO society's chairman said something interesting.
{65402}{65567}She was saved because she fell|in the gap between the dimensions.
{65579}{65841}You may not be aware of it, but there's|a world of dimensions different from ours.
{65865}{65983}The big explosion created a gap between the two worlds.
{65992}{66056}She fell into the gap and survived.
{66491}{66594}I'm from Toyo TV. Is the usual room available?
{66604}{66720}Sorry, miss. Maybe the one across the corridor?
{66735}{66819}Room 384? All right.
{66873}{66936}Are you reporting on vagrants this time?
{67848}{67881}That's her.
{67928}{67956}Isn't it?
{67964}{68055}Not sure. It looks like her.
{68062}{68120}- Let's do it.|- Wait.
{68133}{68249}She saw me, but didn't react. Maybe it's not her.
{68264}{68352}Can I speak to the editor?
{68378}{68399}It's Naoko.
{68427}{68586}I'm here with the Jupiter girl.|Yes, we're in the hotel.
{68606}{68677}That's OK. Can you do me a favour?
{68681}{68852}Will you bring her some clothes? OK. Bye.
{68920}{68976}You should relax tonight.
{68999}{69055}There's someone in the room.
{69115}{69217}There's no one. We're here alone.
{69500}{69529}Good evening.
{69538}{69589}Weren't you aboard the ship?
{69619}{69645}What's wrong?
{69660}{69753}We understood what she meant.
{69762}{69800}What was that?
{69804}{69861}Don't go aboard that ship.
{69978}{70055}Please tell me, why not?
{70187}{70265}What's wrong with that ship?
{70287}{70329}It's too late.
{71844}{71927}Professor, that must be a monster.
{72002}{72089}It's grown another 0.8m since the other day.
{72099}{72199}How odd. Meteorites down grow.
{72205}{72316}But this one does. How is the magnetism?
{72321}{72411}No reaction at all. It's dead.
{72445}{72560}We should leave. It's getting too big.
{72662}{72741}Hey! It's starting again.
{73342}{73393}It fits you nicely.
{73536}{73578}Where are you going?
{73584}{73739}My duty is to warn people about|the danger the Earth is in.
{73745}{73915}Wait! You can tell everyone in|Japan without leaving this room.
{74326}{74484}Hello. Oh no, don't send him up. I'll come down.
{74564}{74644}Wait a minute. Stay here.
{75381}{75421}What do you want brother?
{75477}{75600}Don't pretend. I know you've got the princess.
{75616}{75709}Princess? What you're talking about.
{75712}{75740}Princess.
{75849}{75901}It's been a long time.
{76067}{76121}I am from Jupiter.
{76147}{76274}Nonsense. You're the Princess of Selgina.
{76287}{76338}I've never heard of her.
{76356}{76497}First of all, you must leave here at once.
{76534}{76631}Don't listen to her. Why don't we kill her?
{76636}{76671}Wait!
{76676}{76731}We're not in Selgina anymore.
{76758}{76865}If she's forgotten, I'll remind her.
{77243}{77289}See this dagger?
{77315}{77404}I killed your father with it.
{77410}{77518}Brother, give me back the key. Don't do that!
{77520}{77678}How many times do I have to tell you?|That girl is the princess.
{77682}{77769}I know she's with you. Give me the key!
{77794}{77893}Stop it, or I'll call the police!
{77924}{78006}Stupid! I am the police.
{78021}{78090}I could have you arrested.
{78096}{78190}No. What will you do to the princess?
{78194}{78242}Protect her of course.
{78250}{78359}Then send her back when she comes to her senses.
{78376}{78452}Alright. Come on up.
{78513}{78639}Princess, what did you do with the bracelet?
{78662}{78696}Bracelet?
{78702}{78741}Yes.
{78781}{78948}You wore the royal bracelet on your right arm.
{79014}{79131}Yes! On your right arm, remember?
{79162}{79277}I am from Jupiter. And yet...
{79284}{79349}And yet?
{79398}{79436}What?
{79461}{79546}I may have worn a bracelet.
{79567}{79630}Where is it now?
{79640}{79791}Those things are worthless.|Why can't humans realise this?
{79798}{79854}Where is the bracelet?
{79896}{79981}I gave it to a poor fisherman.
{80319}{80421}What's happened? Turn on the light!
{80477}{80539}Watch out! The killers!
{80837}{80895}Naoko! Hit the alarm!
{81687}{81748}Naoko, turn on the light.
{81847}{81949}Little fairies! Thank you.
{82092}{82134}Princess!
{82359}{82581}'The Symptoms Of Chronic|Amnesia And Delusions'?
{82590}{82722}What's she doing?|You can read in the dark?
{82735}{82807}I am from Jupiter.
{82813}{82894}Let's go. It's too dangerous in town.
{82897}{82920}Where to?
{82928}{83021}I've asked a doctor to examine her.|Come on, quick.
{83502}{83542}It's Godzilla!
{88033}{88105}Where are we going, brother?
{88111}{88162}Doctor Tsukamoto's laboratory.
{88170}{88201}A laboratory?
{88212}{88324}He's an expert in psychology.
{88342}{88407}He often helps the police.
{88681}{88725}Fifteen.
{88927}{88960}Twenty.
{89138}{89177}Good.
{89481}{89558}Doctor, can she be cured?
{89569}{89602}Cured?
{89613}{89819}There's nothing wrong with her.|She's perfectly normal.
{89901}{90012}Doctor, then why does she|say she's from Jupiter?
{90015}{90091}Is she really an alien?
{90134}{90255}I doubt it. I'll make her tell us what she is.
{90286}{90424}I have a new treatment,|a kind of sleeping drug.
{90462}{90491}Look.
{90520}{90601}Why can't you understand?
{90606}{90702}The Earth will perish if we don't act.
{90707}{90806}King Ghidorah will turn it into a dead star.
{90834}{90890}King Ghidorah?
{90895}{91114}One hundred years ago, a monster|destroyed Jupiter's culture and science.
{91129}{91312}Jupiter had once progressed far ahead of Earth.
{91323}{91525}But, because of the space monster|King Ghidorah, it is a dead planet.
{91598}{91680}Will King Ghidorah come to Earth?
{91684}{91783}Yes. He already has.
{91855}{91968}The Earth is coming to an end.
{92040}{92095}You don't believe me?
{92205}{92278}I can see it in your eyes.
{92321}{92415}I feel as if we are the ones being examined.
{92423}{92496}Doctor, you must do something.
{92516}{92616}Right, lie down. Go to sleep.
{92656}{92874}"Attention! Godzilla and Rodan are|moving from Hakone to Mount Fuji."
{92883}{92978}"Get ready to evacuate at once."
{94170}{94230}Hey, get up!
{94366}{94427}Professor, look!
{94501}{94541}Follow me.
{95091}{95180}Professor! Quick! Quick!
{96945}{97012}Look! It's taking shape!
{97382}{97577}"Attention! The monster discovered last night|has been identified as King Ghidorah."
{97584}{97720}"This is an emergency! All citizens|must leave the area!"
{99600}{99903}Gentlemen, Professor Murai has told us how|the space monster King Ghidorah appeared.
{99945}{100050}We had Godzilla and Rodan.
{100054}{100157}And now we have, King Ghidorah!
{100168}{100352}"How will the government deal with this crisis?|The people want to know!"
{100397}{100465}"I call upon the Defence Minister..."
{100468}{100569}...to give us a responsible answer.
{100601}{100639}General Wado.
{100764}{100941}All National Guard units have been put on the alert.
{100961}{101103}They'll be watching the movements|of Godzilla and Rodan.
{101110}{101370}As for King Ghidorah... we're in contact|with the international allied forces.
{101380}{101462}We're doing our best...
{101471}{101582}"...to destroy this monster as soon as possible."
{101586}{101649}We don't want excuses.
{101653}{101774}We want to know how you'll destroy them!
{101775}{101815}General Wando.
{101886}{102002}This is not just our country's problem.
{102017}{102098}The entire world is watching us.
{102134}{102354}Do we have the courage to use atomic|weapons against Godzilla and Rodan?
{102402}{102516}I don't have to explain any more.
{102527}{102682}We can only do our best|and prepare for death.
{102686}{102748}"FUJI NATURAL SCIENCE GARDEN"
{104378}{104508}Gentlemen, I've taken the liberty of|of bringing some people here.
{104519}{104625}As the general said, we need help.
{104630}{104704}Will you listen to them?
{104722}{104752}By all means.
{105197}{105251}Oh, it's that girl!
{105274}{105393}This is Miss Naoko Shindo from Toyo TV.
{105405}{105527}And these are the fairies from Infant Island.
{105663}{105767}I thought you'd returned to the island?
{105776}{105862}No. We're with the prophet now.
{105866}{105908}The prophet?
{105926}{106046}Ah, the girl from Jupiter.|Where is she now?
{106069}{106145}Dr. Tsukamoto's laboratory at Mt. Fuji.
{106159}{106204}Let's go and find her.
{106228}{106366}As you know, Mothra and Godzilla fought once.
{106373}{106673}It may sound primitive and unscientific, but through|the fairies, we could ask Mothra to help.
{106699}{106772}Would you ask her, girls?
{106889}{106926}What is it?
{107006}{107133}We're afraid not even Mothra can|beat King Ghidorah.
{107154}{107283}You mean Mothra can't defend|Infant Island against King Ghidorah?
{107296}{107444}No, that's the problem. But...
{107443}{107533}But? But what?
{107542}{107597}There is a way.
{107600}{107664}How? Tell us.
{107676}{107787}For Godzilla, Rodan and|Mothra to co-operate.
{107873}{108012}If they unite, they may be able|to overcome King Ghidorah.
{108072}{108175}But, who'll persuade Godzilla|and Rodan to co-operate?
{108186}{108282}Mothra might. We'll ask her to.
{108364}{108526}But, if Godzilla and Rodan refuse,|it will be the end.
{110335}{110498}We don't have much time! Call|Mothra immediately, we beg you!
{110508}{110559}Please, call her now!
{115341}{115421}Doctor, is she in a coma?
{115496}{115546}Draw the curtains.
{115581}{115668}All of you, get ready to evacuate.
{115919}{116096}Now, maybe we'll find out who she really is.
{116178}{116304}You're sleeping, but your brain is awake.
{116401}{116487}Tell us who you are.
{116518}{116609}I come from Jupiter.
{116734}{116786}Is that so?
{116790}{116955}But, people from Jupiter|don't live on the Earth.
{116971}{117014}How did you get here?
{117028}{117229}I'm one of the people who escaped Jupiter|on the last day of the planet.
{117250}{117281}When was that?
{117289}{117344}Five thousand years ago.
{117348}{117470}Five thousand years ago?|How could you live so long?
{117473}{117573}Of course I couldn't.
{117606}{117856}When our ancestors reached the Earth,|they integrated with Earth people.
{117873}{118105}Our excellent talents degenerated and|we inherited only some of their instincts.
{118117}{118156}What instincts?
{118162}{118253}To foresee the future.
{118296}{118338}Doctor!
{118648}{118751}Do you believe she is the princess?
{118755}{118836}Of course she's the princess.
{118896}{118969}Let's try shock treatment.
{118978}{119022}Shock treatment?
{119087}{119267}"Godzilla and Rodan are approaching!|Evacuate this area immediately!"
{119275}{119384}Let's get her. Know we know where she is.
{119563}{119614}Doctor, what shall we do?
{119617}{119702}We can't stop the process now.
{119706}{119748}It's Godzilla!
{120474}{120560}Increase the voltage to 500.
{120574}{120629}No more, or she'll die.
{121310}{121347}Now what?
{121350}{121438}We don't need to dirty our hands to kill her.
{121794}{121834}3,000 volts?
{121856}{121900}She won't survive.
{121938}{121983}Let's check it again.
{122009}{122094}Go away! Godzilla is coming!
{123021}{123098}- It's OK.|- Good. Let's start.
{123288}{123343}Are you sure it's at 500?
{123346}{123375}Yes.
{123612}{123724}- The power's gone off.|- Let me check it.
{123954}{124009}Doctor! The assassins!
{124144}{124174}We're in time.
{124272}{124308}Stay here.
{124548}{124582}Go to the front door!
{125215}{125262}Doctor! It's alright now!
{125602}{125633}Anyone here?
{125858}{125899}Oi, wait!
{126057}{126090}Brother!
{126107}{126167}Stupid! What are you doing here?
{126175}{126217}Mothra is coming!
{126219}{126237}What?
{126239}{126299}Don't just stand there. Help us!
{129894}{129971}Doctor! Where are your staff?
{129976}{130032}They're right behind us.
{130038}{130099}- You said Mothra was coming?|- Yes.
{130102}{130175}- Why?|- To fight King Ghidorah.
{130177}{130294}Leave this place quickly before it|become a land of death!
{130311}{130378}What did you find out?
{130382}{130432}She really must be from Jupiter.
{130596}{130700}Stop the car! Mothra! Mothra is here!
{130746}{130787}Get out of the car.
{130864}{130933}Quickly, quickly! Let's go up.
{134771}{134807}Take this.
{135286}{135349}Mothra is talking to them.
{135511}{135583}What are they saying to each other?
{135609}{135725}What do I know? I don't speak|monster language.
{135780}{135824}What is she saying?
{135862}{135984}She is trying to persuade them.|But they don't agree.
{135996}{136191}She says, "Let's stop fighting each|other and unite against King Ghidorah."
{136196}{136254}Do Godzilla and Rodan agree?
{136259}{136451}No. Godzilla and Rodan say it's none of|their business. They don't care.
{136455}{136544}Damn them.
{136558}{136823}Godzilla says he has no reason to help humans.|Humans always make trouble.
{136852}{136933}Rodan says he agrees.
{137049}{137100}Get out of the way!
{137115}{137184}Fool! Selfish dog!
{137320}{137357}Ghidorah!
{138302}{138431}Mothra is saying "Don't|fight anymore. It's no use."
{138436}{138606}But Godzilla and Rodan|both want an apology.
{138826}{138926}But, Mothra is still trying.
{138932}{139061}Damn them! I thought only humans|could be so stubborn!
{139619}{139684}Hey, see if the trail is clear.
{139723}{139748}What is it?
{139755}{139813}The road is blocked.
{139847}{139911}There's only one way left.
{139920}{139960}Follow us!
{140021}{140085}Haven't they agreed yet?
{140102}{140157}They're still talking.
{140192}{140258}We should move up higher.
{140440}{140540}Come on, let's keep moving!
{140899}{141036}Mothra is telling them that the Earth|doesn't just belong to humans.
{141041}{141246}It's theirs too, so they should defend it.|They're almost convinced.
{141401}{141452}No, they're not.
{141458}{141510}What will happen now?
{141515}{141592}Mothra is going to fight alone.
{141630}{141673}That's impossible!
{141934}{142078}Godzilla, Rodan! Go!|Fight with Mothra!
{142082}{142133}Mothra! Good luck!
{143838}{143927}Godzilla and Rodan are going to fight!
{143946}{144041}Hey! The princess has disappeared!
{144091}{144114}Look that way!
{144214}{144246}I'm going this way.
{145565}{145678}Go back! The fire has cut the path!
{148746}{148838}O God, creator of the universe!
{148843}{148947}Save this planet from the evil monster.
{148963}{149050}Save it from becoming a dead star.
{149248}{149273}Princess!
{149492}{149549}Princess! Get down!
{151777}{151869}Malness! You traitor!
{151962}{152008}You've recovered your memory?
{152021}{152068}Who are you?
{152070}{152166}I'm a Japanese police officer.|I'm your bodyguard.
{152365}{152397}I'm alright.
{153568}{153592}What's that?
{153604}{153652}My brothers raincoat!
{153831}{153889}Brother!
{153890}{153950}Hey, Shindo!
{153976}{154017}Hey!
{154021}{154121}Go to the hut on the pass and bring a rope!
{156313}{156353}Good.
{158653}{158810}Doctor! Doctor, doctor.|What's happening? What shall we do?
{159339}{159402}It's the end of our village.
{159495}{159547}Look! A landslide!
{162075}{162123}Anything to say?
{162137}{162303}I wonder... did I really say|I was from Jupiter?
{162310}{162418}Yes, but you had your wits|about you all the time.
{162425}{162564}And your predictions were right.|No human could have done that.
{162571}{162662}But, how did I recover my memory?
{162678}{162878}You had a real shock.|You were shot here. It worked.
{162882}{163034}Could I ever have these powers again?
{163037}{163280}Well, I couldn't say.|It's still beyond my ability.
{163812}{163870}Thank you, Shindo.
{163892}{163979}You saved my life three times.
{163991}{164034}Three times?
{164079}{164139}At the hotel.
{164165}{164226}At the laboratory.
{164271}{164323}And when I got shot.
{164329}{164428}You remember what happened at|the hotel and laboratory?
{164483}{164568}I don't remember anything else.
{164581}{164695}Only that you saved me.|I don't know why.
{164869}{165014}I won't ever forget what you did.
{165019}{165161}Princess. I wish you a long and happy life.
{165465}{165518}Thank you so much.
{166648}{166808}Goodbye everyone! We're going|back to Infant Island.
{166821}{166956}Goodbye! Goodbye!

Each person who tries to see beyond his own time, must face questions to which there cannot yet be proven answers.
Hey, thanks a lot. Take it easy.
Hey, 'bo.
Hi.
What are you doing, you... boiling coffee?
Yeah.
That's good. That's real good.
You hoboing?
You know, kind of.
I'm trying to get to California.
I'm walking, hitchhiking, and I'm getting there kind of slow.
What's in California?
My older sister and my brother-in-law in Fresno.
Grapes?
I said, "Grapes?"
My brother-in-law works for Sears and Roebuck.
He's gonna get me in there.
I need a job.
Pretty good job, too.
- Where do you come from?
- Horseheads, New York.
- Yeah, I know where that is.
- You've been to Horseheads?
No, I ain't never been to Horseheads, but I've been to the Finger Lakes district, but that was... a long, long time ago. Long ago.
Listen, you're going a long way to find a job, ain't you?
Well, yeah, I...
Just wasn't anything to keep me in Horseheads.
Except maybe the Scouts.
Well, my mother died July 24th.
Peritonitis.
- You were a Boy Scout?
- A scoutmaster. Troop 170, Horseheads.
What's that?
Oh, that ain't nothing.
- My dog.
- What?
I said, it's my dog. He's my buddy.
He must be roasting in there.
No, he's not roasting.
He likes it hot like I like it hot.
I'm sorry, I never saw a dog in a bag.
- Well, maybe he has to go.
- Maybe.
Gee, he's cute.
Yeah, well, he's 14 years old.
- Oh, well, he sure doesn't look it.
- I know he don't.
- What's his name?
- His name is Peke, like in Pekinese.
But he's a Pomeranian, isn't he?
No, he ain't. He's a bum just like me.
We're two bums.
How...
How long you been in this part of the state?
Oh, almost two weeks.
I got a job on a dairy farm not too far from here.
You know, to make a little extra cash.
I'm a real good milker.
What's your name?
- Willie.
- Come here.
Come here.
Now sit down.
Let me tell you something, when you're on the road, see another bum, you meet anybody, you don't tell him you got any money, because, boy, they're liable to kill you to get it.
Why, it wasn't even $10.
That don't make no difference!
You tell them nothing!
Yes, sir.
Have you ever seen a house that looked like that?
Don't look at the hand, look at the house.
Oh, it looks like any ordinary little farmhouse to me.
You see, this is a photograph that I cut out of Liberty magazine.
Now, that's not the exact house, but it sure does look like the one I'm looking for.
Yeah. I doubt I ever seen it.
All right now, come on, you, sit up.
Sit up for Carl.
You little bastard.
This house, you see, this house has a post in front of it.
On that post there was a sign.
And on that sign it says,
"Skin Illustrations."
Skin Illustration.
- Oh, well...
- Listen to me.
You tell me, boy, and you tell me goddamn true.
- Have you ever seen a sign that say that?
- No, sir, I never did.
- Are you sure?
- I am sure.
I'd remember something like that if I did.
I never saw anything like that. Honest.
- You're sure?
- Oh, yes, I'm sure. I'm positive, honest.
Well, I'm gonna find it.
I'm gonna find it.
Well, there must be 100 houses like that around here.
I'm only looking for one.
And I'm looking for the lady that lives in it.
And when I find her,
I will kill her.
Oh, yes. Oh, yes,
I will kill her.
I don't know, you know, sometimes I know where that house is.
Exactly.
I mean, it comes into my...
Comes into my mind as clear as a bell.
And then I start going there, and then I knew that I'm getting close to it because I can feel it inside of me.
I just know that I'm getting close to it and then...
Just when I think that I'm there, the damn thing goes right out of my head.
Maybe she moved.
Yeah. Oh, boy, she moved.
She moved and she took the whole blessed house with her.
She moved all right.
That was a long time ago.
Long time ago, that was...
It was on Labor Day.
Tomorrow's Labor Day.
Same as any other day to me.
Well, not to me, it ain't.
- That's a garter snake.
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna kill it.
Well, it's a garter snake.
Out of the way, I said it's a snake.
I'll kill it.
- They're good. They're not gonna hurt you.
- They're not good!
Come on. Die.
Die!
Die!
Die!
Get it away from him.
No, no. Let him eat it.
Do him some good.
Maybe he'll sit up straighter.
They're good to have around.
They weren't gonna hurt anybody.
Wouldn't have hurt you.
They're no good for nothing in any goddamn place in the world!
It's a snake, ain't it?
And I tell you what I could use right now, boy.
I could use some good, cheap bourbon whiskey.
- You got any of that?
- No.
I love that.
Peke don't like it, but I love it.
Why would you wanna kill anybody?
You wanna know why? All right.
I'll show you why.
Oh, my God.
Well, go on, take a look!
Wow.
Pretty, ain't they?
I never saw anything like that.
Well, that...
That's the most fantastic thing I ever saw.
Is that what you meant by skin illustrations? Tattoos?
They're not tattoos.
They're skin illustrations.
Don't you ever call them tattoos.
Let me tell you, don't you look at those illustrations too long, because they'll come alive and they'll tell you stories.
You remember that lady that I was talking to you about? Remember her?
Well, I tell you what she did for me, she created for me my own private hell.
You see that blank space on my back there? See it?
And now the people look into that and they see the future.
Well, that's all well and good.
But if you want to see your future, you may have to pay a price because you may look in there, see how you're gonna die.
You may look in there and see what you're gonna look like when you're old and rotten and shriveled and mean and through.
Well, people don't like to see that, do they? No, they don't!
So after a while, they don't like me and then after a while, they grow to hate me!
But didn't you have any doubts about getting tattooed all over like that?
I wasn't thinking about getting tattooed.
I was thinking about getting laid.
And I told you once before, and this is the last time I am gonna tell you, please, don't ever call them tattoos.
I'm sure I never saw a house like that with a sign like that anywhere around here.
Well, maybe she went back into the future someplace.
"Back" into the future?
That's what I said, back into the future.
Maybe 1,000 years.
I was working this two-bit carnival.
I was putting up tents.
Anyway, it was a hot day and there was this lion, he was screaming and there was this elephant, he was answering back.
And I don't know, I was horny that day,
I just had to get out of there, so I took myself a little walk.
I walked along and I came to this place.
This house.
And there was a post in front of it.
On that post was a sign, and on that sign it said,
"Skin Illustrations."
"Skin Illustrations."
Hello.
Hello.
Well, it's... It's kind of hot, ain't it?
Very.
Well, does it always get this hot around Labor Day?
Sometimes.
Can I offer you something cold to drink?
Well, water'd be fine.
I have some lemonade all ready.
Come on in.
All right.
Come on.
Come on.
Nothing satisfies like lemonade when it's real hot like this.
Well, I guess you could say that.
What a magnificently strong hand.
Well, I don't know,
I guess it got that strong swinging the big hammer at the carnival.
Carnival life must be very exciting.
I also handle the elephant shovel, and I don't think you could call that exciting.
Come and sit down.
- Over there?
- Next to me.
Anyway, that's what I do.
I put tents up and then I take tents down and, well, that's about it.
Anyway... you know, sometimes when they have a heavy day, you see, they let me...
Hand.
When they have a heavy day, they let me collect tickets.
And then, of course, some days when it ain't too heavy, they don't let me do nothing.
Right there.
In the very center.
I know just what belongs there.
That's when I learned what her name was.
"There's a rose," she said,
"a rose you'll always carry in your hand.
"A rose from Felicia."
Well, I think the rose is just beautiful.
I haven't seen anything like that even in the circus.
Circus? Let me tell you something, son.
There ain't a circus or a carnival in this country touch us with a ten foot pole, you know.
I told you before, these things come alive, and when they come alive, they scare people.
Nobody's gonna hang around and look at them.
And I know they come alive,
'cause, you see,
I can feel them squirming, moving on my back.
I can't hear what they're saying, but, boy, I can feel them moving.
Peke, he don't, well, he don't hear nothing anyway.
With his garter snakes and his little bugs anyway.
But, boy, I know they're there.
I still think the rose is beautiful.
So did I.
So did I.
She knew everything and she had been everywhere.
There's a rose you'll always carry in your hand.
A rose from Felicia.
Come.
Come on.
Come and see it outside.
The colors are so much more alive.
Come on, come over here. Come here.
Tell me you love it.
I love it.
What's your name?
My name is Carl.
Carl.
Tell me what you smell right now.
Right this very minute.
What I smell?
Well, I'll...
I smell dust and I smell... dry weeds.
Yeah, something else.
Yeah, but I'm, I don't know unless you can say...
- Something else.
- Well, I do. I kind of smell the heat.
Yeah, that's right.
Now try to imagine all those smells somewhere else, not here, somewhere else.
Well, I don't know.
Where... I could say where the lions live, down in Africa.
That's right.
Where the lions live, down in Africa.
Right there, Carl.
Right there.
Right there, well...
I was the one that said it. Idiot me.
Oh, yeah, right there, where the lions live, down in Africa.
She had lived in the past, and she had lived in the future and she put it all on me.
They're filthy things.
The lions?
No, not the lions, the stinking vultures in the tree.
I wanted you to see just what
I've been seeing every day for weeks.
Well, I've seen it. Come on, let's go.
What do you suppose they're feeding on?
I don't know. Maybe zebra, giraffe.
Something like that. Come on. Come on.
Carl, did you hear a scream?
No.
You didn't hear anything?
No, I didn't hear anything.
I don't want our children to play here anymore, Carl.
Please turn it off.
It's been the same African veldt for weeks now.
Ever since you and Johnny had that argument.
All right, all right. I know that, I know that.
It was your idea to install the playroom in the first place, so our children could work off the...
What was it you called it?
Natural hostilities?
I'm sorry we ever bought the damn thing!
So am I. So am I.
But you're the one that sold me on the free involvement theory, instantaneous atmosphere.
If a child wants anything, wishes it hard enough, all he has to do is flip a switch and there you are.
Well, electronic image or not,
I don't like it.
- We've got to get rid of it, Carl.
- We'll have to talk to the children first.
The children can go in there and think of anything.
The past, the future.
They can think of anything.
It could become destructive.
Apparently, the Minister of Mental Health doesn't share your protective attitude.
Well, to hell with him. I don't want to experiment with my own children.
All right, then for the time being, we'll consider the playroom out of bounds.
All right?
Now what we need is a good, stiff drink.
Maybe it's just me.
Just my imagination.
No, it's not you, it's not your imagination.
It's the world we live in.
Everything is done for us.
You throw a glass into the glass incinerator and out comes a freshly molded glass.
What's left for us to do?
What, the body functions? Sleep, sex?
What's left?
I don't know.
I don't know, maybe it's the stupid labor laws.
Can't work more than six months a year.
So you mustn't upset the great planned global balance of economy.
Well, that's great for business, isn't it?
What about the other six months of the year?
I don't know.
Carl, make love to me.
Why?
Well, why?
Maybe this time it'll be different.
- Who is it?
- It's Will McLean.
Caught you both with a drink in your hand.
Don't tell me the sun's already over the yardarm out there in Baltimore.
- Hello, Will.
- How's it going?
Oh, putting in my time.
Talking to a lot of sick people.
Hey, listen, I got a breakfast meeting in Havana tomorrow morning.
I thought I might stop off on my way back.
- Well, we'll be here.
- Can you make it for lunch?
- I'd love to. How are the kids?
- Great.
Will, Carl doesn't share my concern, but when you come, I'd like to talk to you about a possible problem.
- Johnny?
- Yeah, Johnny, I think. Maybe both.
Listen, how long have you been our Mental Health Counselor?
Anna was three.
Well, then you know how sometimes her mother, she gets over-excited about something that may not exist.
It's that nursery, Will. It scares me.
What do you mean, "Uh-oh"?
Well, what do you mean, "Uh-oh"?
Well, we've been having our share of problems in that area of
The Free Involvement Program.
Hey, look, I'll talk about it with you tomorrow. Okay?
Okay.
- See you about 1:00?
- Around then. 'Licia.
- Be well.
- Bye.
Carl, Felicia, we're home!
The Science Carnival was great!
That's too far to go alone.
Too far?
Don't argue with your father.
Get ready for dinner.
We're not hungry.
We ate all kinds of stuff at the Carnival.
We just loved Bermuda.
We're going back again tomorrow.
You're not going anywhere, unless I give you permission.
That goes for you, too, young lady.
Now you go with your mother and get ready for dinner.
Come on.
All I know is that, when I was your age,
I wasn't allowed to attach my space capsule to any navigational beam over 100 miles in distance.
I mean, not until I was over 16 years of age, anyway.
Suppose you had to go 150 miles?
You just didn't go.
Well, what could they do to you if you did?
What do you mean? If you got caught?
Yeah.
Oh, they'd revoke your space license.
Did you think that was fair then?
Since you're asking so many questions, let me ask you a question about that fancy nursery of yours.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about Africa and I'm talking about the lions, that's what I'm talking about.
There's no Africa in the nursery.
There isn't, no?
Well, I think it's only fair to tell you that your mother and I spent a little time in there today.
I don't remember any Africa.
Do you, Anna?
Go see, Anna. See what we left on.
She doesn't have to go see.
We've both seen it already.
- You're mistaken.
- I'm mistaken?
All right, we're gonna find out who's mistaken.
You come with me, young man. Come on.
Let's go, and let's go quick.
I've had enough of this now.
Let's go, Felicia.
We'll find out pretty quick who's mistaken.
All right. Whose idea was this?
Anna and I play all the time here.
- Every day?
- Not every day.
- Almost every day.
- Almost every day.
I see.
Well, of course, you... do play in the African veldt from time to time though, don't you?
I think we did once.
A long time ago.
Do you remember how long ago, young lady?
A long time ago.
- Months and months ago.
- I see, I see.
All right, I wanna tell you something now.
Your mother and I know that you're lying, you understand that?
- Oh, Carl, leave it alone.
- I don't care. We don't...
Leave it alone.
All right, go on. Go get cleaned up.
- We're not that dirty.
- Go get cleaned up.
Sound waves can't hurt you.
Go on, do as your father says. Go on.
Well, obviously our children are trying to make fools out of us.
Well, Carl, Will will be here tomorrow.
He'll... He'll know what to do.
He's trained to deal with these problems.
Look, I tell you what. Let them play in here tomorrow if they want to, but don't say anything about
Will coming to lunch. All right?
- All right.
- And don't worry. We'll straighten it out.
It's been like that for weeks now, just the way we found it.
What are they eating?
I don't know.
- Vultures here all the time?
- All the time.
Doesn't feel good, Carl.
What do you mean it doesn't feel good?
Well, all children get the feeling that their parents are persecuting them, but this goes beyond that.
In what way?
Well, Johnny and Anna aren't releasing destructive thoughts here anymore.
They're embracing them.
Embracing them?
There's a point at which fantasy becomes dangerously close to reality.
Carl, rip it down, get rid of it.
I was wrong to recommend it in the first place. I realize that.
Just get rid of it.
That's Felicia's scarf.
That's my slipper.
- The room will hate you if you kill it!
- Now, you stop talking like that, Johnny.
- It has feelings, too. You can't kill it!
- Listen, I'm not killing anything.
It's not a human being. It's a machine.
A machine you can have if you've got the money to buy it. That's all it is.
So, now, you stop it!
Johnny, tomorrow Dr. Will is coming to take us to therapy refuge for a vacation.
- Doesn't that please you?
- No, it doesn't. I like it here.
I'm not going to any creepy place where I have to do everything myself.
Now, you listen to me and you listen to me good, young man.
You talk to your mother one more time in that tone of voice and I'll give you a slap across the face that you'll never forget.
- You'd better not.
- Don't you talk to me like that!
- Carl, leave him alone.
- I don't care.
I'm not gonna have any son of mine talk to me like that in my house.
Now, go to bed!
Go on, get going.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know.
You don't know what?
What do you want me to do?
What are you looking at?
You're as guilty as he is.
You're both in this thing together and I know it.
Go on, get out of here.
Go on. When I say go, go.
Leave her alone, Carl.
She's not causing any trouble.
What do you mean she's not causing any trouble?
This house is loaded with trouble.
The nursery, that's trouble, isn't it?
Go on, go to bed when I tell you.
Johnny's right!
I'm certainly glad to get away for a while, I tell you.
The thing I love about Will, he's so understanding.
I guess he is. I guess he is.
Listen.
Yesterday, before Will called, we were about to come up here and make love.
Do you remember?
Were we?
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah.
How do you feel now?
No.
Carl, Felicia, come quickly. Hurry!
Mommy, Daddy, quick, quick!
Mommy, Daddy.
- Carl! Felicia! Come quick!
- Carl! Felicia! Hurry! Quick!
Mommy! Mommy! Daddy! Come quick!
Hurry! Daddy! Mommy!
Carl! Felicia! Quickly! Hurry!
Morning. Everybody ready?
Carl?
'Licia!
Where is everybody?
Johnny?
Carl?
Johnny?
Anna?
Where are your parents?
May I offer you a cup of coffee? Doctor?
Oh, my God.
You want a cup of coffee?
- Hey.
- Huh?
May I offer you a cup of coffee?
Oh, yes, thank you.
I know what you're thinking.
The funny thing is that women usually ask that question before men do.
Well, the answer is yes.
I'm covered with pictures from the neck right down to the toes.
Everywhere, and I mean everywhere.
Yes, sir.
Everywhere.
I remember that lady.
Boy, she had lilacs around her house and in the heat it used to stink to high heaven, and I mean to the high heaven.
Man, they smelled so sweet, they made you dizzy.
- Did I tell you about the lilacs?
- No, I don't think so.
- I didn't tell you about it?
- No, I don't think so.
They made you puke.
- Yeah, you told me about the lilacs.
- I thought I did, yeah.
Yeah. I remember her.
I remember it was about this time of evening and
I was sitting there and all of a sudden it hit me. It hit me that I had had enough.
I had just had enough.
I mean, I was... Man, I was there with the wherewithal, I was ready, willing and able. I was more than able.
And then it dawned on me that nothing was gonna happen, ever.
And there I was.
Boy, I was sitting there like a big idiot, with half my body covered in skin illustrations.
Skin illustrations.
And all the time, she knew what she was doing.
Well, no more, thank you.
Why don't you sit down and rest for a bit?
No, thank you. That last one hurt.
No, thank you.
I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna...
Rig the midway and get ready for the night time rubes.
When you coming back?
What?
When you coming back?
I don't know.
Maybe sometime tomorrow.
- You're lying.
- I am not.
Don't you ever call me a liar.
I never lie. I never lie.
When I've finished with you, think of the money you can make.
You'll be more beautiful than anyone on this entire planet, I promise you.
- I'd be a freak.
- You'd be beautiful.
I would not be beautiful.
I would be a freak.
No, Carl. You'll be something special.
You'll be beautiful. You'll matter.
Jesus Christ in heaven, these damn things don't come off. I'm half a freak now.
Carl...
- Let me finish.
- You're not gonna finish nothing.
Did you let me touch you for one second?
You did not.
What do you think I am, some kind of stupid animal or something?
You're a man, Carl. A man.
Never flinch from pain.
Pain is part of everything good.
Lie down.
I'll make you happier than you've ever been in your whole life.
You know what I'm gonna put there?
What?
A rocket.
I'm gonna look like the Fourth of July.
That's what I said.
I'll look like the Fourth of July.
What was the reason you didn't leave when you started to?
Well, why haven't you left?
- Don't you get personal.
- I'm sorry.
Now, shut up now! Come on now!
Shut up!
All you do is make noise in the world.
That's how you handle little things, see?
You just yell at them and they shut up like a clam.
And that puts them in their proper place.
Man, I don't like little things.
I don't like bugs and frogs and spiders and creepy, crawly things that zing out at you and bite you when you're not looking.
You know what a tick looks like?
Well, sure. I've seen ticks.
Yeah, well, they're the worst because they find you no matter where you are.
And they creep up on you and they suck your blood, see?
Oh, they stink. They is rotten things.
- Yeah, I don't like ticks either.
- Yeah, neither do I.
Let me give you a word of advice.
Don't get too personal with me.
Okay. I didn't mean anything by it.
Yeah, that's enough now. I don't wanna talk about it no more. Understood?
All right, come on, Peke, come on.
It's time to go to bed.
That's a good dog.
Just say your prayers and you get a good night's sleep.
She's...
She's very beautiful, isn't she?
You've seen her, haven't you?
Haven't you?
Well?
Haven't you?
Yes.
Well, now you know.
I'll tell you one thing.
And I told her,
"Lady, you put anything on me,
"and I want it to be big,
"and I want it to have power,
"and I want it to have energy,
"like a... A rocket."
How long have we been here?
Six days.
Can't be six days. It's more than six days.
Just six days.
Can't be six days. It's more than six days.
We've been here longer than six days.
Can't be six days. It's more than six days.
We've been here longer than six days.
Well, shut up! I'm in command here, and don't you forget that.
That goes for the rest of you, too.
Anybody who tries to think on his own is going to get shot down like a deserter.
Is that understood?
I've been in this situation before and I've survived it.
Why?
What did you say?
I said, Colonel, why do you think you have survived any more than we have?
Yeah, that's good, Williams.
Answer him that one, Colonel.
Because I'm stronger than you are, that's why.
And what about you, Simmons, huh?
Wanna see how strong I am, how tough I am?
You wanna push your luck in with these two and see how far you can push me?
I just wanna get to a Sun Dome, that's all.
He doesn't know where there's one, Sim.
What the hell are we following him for?
Colonel, you don't know where we are any more than we do.
Why the hell are we following you?
Will you listen to me?
Four of us got out of that wreckage alive.
Alive! That means something.
That's the big difference.
That means we got a chance to survive.
Now, there's 120 Sun Domes scattered over 1 1 continents on this stinking planet, and if we find one, one Sun Dome, we've made it.
We came through, we survived.
They can get a ship up here and pull us off within a month.
You got a better idea, Simmons? Pickard?
You, Williams, you're so bloody smart, so sarcastic.
Show me the way to a Sun Dome.
Everything's a guess, isn't it?
Well, I only know one thing.
Keep moving and you keep alive.
That's all I know.
And we're gonna move.
We're gonna follow this stream and we're gonna pray that it takes us to the shore of the Single Sea.
There's one Sun Dome every 20 miles.
If we get there, we've made it and we are alive.
So, on your feet and let's go.
We'll follow the stream and pray it gets us there.
The rain hurts my head.
You put your head in there, it's like a kettle drum.
In three hours you're stone deaf.
Well, a deaf man is a cripple, and I'm not having a cripple on my back.
Get up, get on your feet, and you follow me.
Come on, move out.
There's not enough space between this rain to breathe.
My lungs feel like they're going to split open.
All right, listen to me, listen to me.
Bend your head forward.
Bend your head forward, and try to get the water out of your mouth and breathe deep, come on.
Take a deep breath.
I don't think you're getting us anywhere.
All right. Shut up.
Keep your mouth shut, save your energy.
Keep talking, that's a convenient way to commit suicide.
You'd like that.
You've been waiting for that, haven't you?
I said no talking.
That goes for you, too, now.
Yes, sir, Colonel.
Don't talk.
- My head.
- I said, don't talk.
Come on, come on, come on, no more of this standing here.
It's our ship.
Well, Colonel, here we are, right back where we started from seven days ago.
I could get in there for the map case, Colonel.
You go near the ship, you'll get contaminated.
Forget it.
Without those survival maps, we're never gonna find anything.
You don't think he's gonna admit that, do you, Sim?
He won't even admit he's been leading us around in circles.
- Hey, Williams.
- What?
- Let's kill him.
- What for?
Our lives mean nothing to him.
If Sim had listened to him, he'd still be here.
You know, I hate him, Williams.
- Yeah, well.
- God, I really hate him.
Come here.
Now, what's that? What is it?
- A Sun Dome.
- That's right.
My guess! My guess!
- This is it, isn't it?
- This is what?
Just means there should be another
Sun Dome about 20 miles from here.
How do we know it's not destroyed like this one, Colonel?
I don't know.
We just hope, that's all.
Pickard! Pickard!
He's trying to drown himself.
- Let me go.
- It's too late for him.
Even this little bit of shelter is better than none.
It doesn't pound you all the time.
It pounds you, the rain.
I tell you something, Williams.
I'm glad that you made it this far with me.
Not because it's you, but because somebody's with me.
Colonel,
I've got a surprise for you.
I'm deaf.
Why don't you issue me one of your famous survival orders, so I can tell you what to do with it, huh?
I can't hear you.
Can't hear you, Colonel. Gone.
Well, damn you, look at my mouth.
Read my lips.
I read your lips, Colonel.
But I can't understand what you're saying.
I don't understand you at all.
Williams, I figure we've only got about 10 more miles to go.
If we get there...
Look at me.
If we get there, it will be dry, it will be warm.
There will be the sun.
And women.
Women?
There are old, sexy women just around the corner.
Is that what you're trying to tell me, Colonel?
Now, tell me, are they whores?
Space whores?
That's supposed to suck me in, huh, Colonel?
Does the Space Manual say, "At last resort, promise your men anything,
"including a gorgeous whore," huh?
What if, Colonel, what if a certain kind of man doesn't want a whore? lf, in fact, the thought repulses him.
What then?
Then I'd say... I'd say he was a liar.
I'm not a liar.
Do me one last favor, will you, Colonel?
Go find yourself a nice, private, quiet, lovely
Sun Dome whorehouse.
You're not a man, Williams.
You're a shit!
And what are you, Colonel? What are you?
Destroy, right? Destroy and command.
Anything. Anything.
Anything that gets in your way.
Anything that's more refined, more sensitive, anything that loves.
Destroy and command and take over.
And stamp out anything.
Colonel.
Oh, Colonel, you're a rotten breed.
Low, basic, rotten breed.
You destroy.
You'd destroy the world, wouldn't you?
To survive.
Get on your feet.
And that's an order!
Get out of here.
Go on, get out of here.
This is my time.
I know it.
And I'm glad I know it.
You wanna know something funny?
I won't even hear the laser pop.
But you will.
Welcome, Colonel.
Where are you going?
None of your damn business where I'm going.
You want to hear what happened later on in the night?
No.
She almost treated me like I were her husband.
Please.
I have to go.
She really got to love them illustrations.
She'd look at them, then she'd begin to study them.
And then she'd laugh.
After a while, she'd begin to touch them all over.
And then, she'd begin to kiss them.
And that made her real happy.
I wanna go.
Go.
What makes you think you can keep me here?
What makes you think you can go?
Be quiet, you little fool.
Nobody's talking to you. Go back to sleep.
She couldn't have wanted you.
You're never gonna find her.
Never. You're never gonna find her.
Never.
I love you so.
So glad you're back.
Tell me what happened.
There was a final World Forum.
It is as we dreamed, isn't it?
Yes.
All the male population of the world attended.
It was 2193.
And they all agreed.
They had the same vision, without exception.
Tonight is the last night of the world?
Tonight's the last night of the world.
Tonight's the last night of the world.
Tonight's the last night of the world.
Tonight's the last night of the world.
How, Carl?
No one knows how.
But all dreamed of an ending.
As it was in 4187, when the gas cloud covered the earth and the only people that survived were on the highest mountains.
This time no one will survive?
No one.
That was the unanimous conclusion of the Forum.
How are the children?
Beautiful, as always.
What did the World Forum rule?
Peoples of the Earth are reconciled that this is the last night of the world.
And only the children are not to know.
What do we do?
They're to be spared.
Tell them nothing, then?
The ruling was that they were spared the dream so they should be spared the experience.
How can they be spared?
They're to be put to sleep.
Put to sleep?
Put to sleep?
They're to be given these at bedtime.
Kill the children?
Oh, that's impossible. I don't believe it.
The world's agreed.
Oh, no, never. Never.
Our children are everything.
They're the future.
There will be no future.
They're all agreed.
They had the same dream.
Nothingness.
No one on Earth had a different dream?
No one.
I will not kill my children.
We're subject to the ruling.
I don't care about the ruling.
Felicia, all those at the Forum love their children as we love ours.
But none want to see them suffer.
We don't know how the end will be.
Will it be sudden?
Will it be lingering?
Will they be burned to death?
Mommy!
Father! Father's back!
Oh, Father, we missed you so much.
Is anything wrong?
No, no, no. No, nothing's wrong.
It's just that... your mother was so pleased to see your father home, she started to cry.
Sometimes people do that when they're happy, you see.
Now, which one of you rode the animals most today?
- He did.
- No, she did.
Wait, wait, wait now.
That's no way to welcome your father home with an argument.
I tell you what. You...
You go outside and play some more.
All right?
Go on.
You're their father, Carl.
Could you kill them?
It didn't happen.
Carl.
It didn't happen.
You bastard.
You killed them.
You killed your own children.
Shut up.
What the hell? Didn't I...
Well, what the hell are you doing there?
Boy, I tell you, these days...
Get over there and get in there.
You give me any more trouble tonight and I'll throw you in the lake.
Don't you come out either, or I'll crown you.
You're evil.
You killed them, didn't you?
You killed them.
You killed Pickard.
You killed Simmons. You kill people.
You crummy bastard.
What the hell are you talking about, huh?
I never killed anybody.
The one person I'm gonna kill, that's the lady, if I find her.
Boy, if I find her, I'm gonna step on her like a cockroach and throw her away like a dog throws away a dead snake.
No, you won't!
What are you going to do, little boy?
Go ahead. Go ahead. Get down there.
Get down there. Come here.
All right now, watch it!
You made love to her, didn't you?
Didn't you make love to her?
Why don't you just shut up before I split your skull. Shut up!
Now, you listen to me and understand.
You're the one who was curious.
You're the one who wanted to see the future.
So now, you just take it easy, sonny boy.
And you just relax.
And just relax now.
Relax, sonny boy.
It's almost daybreak.
Why don't you lie on my bed and relax?
I won't be long.
Carl!
Carl!
Carl!
Felicia?
Did you call me?
Carl.
Carl.
Felicia!
Felicia!
Yeah, you're trying to tell me she didn't come back to the house, huh?
She took the house with her.
What do you mean she took the house with her?
I mean that she took everything except the kitchen chair.
She took everything and left one chair?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
She took everything but the kitchen chair.
On it was my clothes and my shoes.
And there it was, standing all alone in the middle of the field.
Where'd she go?
She went back into the future, beyond our own time.
People don't disappear.
Houses don't disappear.
Nothing disappears.
Well, then you show me the house.
You find me the lady.
You're a liar.
You.
If I'm a liar, where did these come from?
You've been looking at them, haven't you?
You watched them come alive, didn't you?
Didn't you?
- Didn't you?
- Yeah.
Well, who put them there?
'Cause I didn't.
You think that over, Willie.
Oh, my God.
Each person who tries to see beyond his own time must face questions to which there cannot yet be absolute answers.
English
Now, look right.
Left.
They're both fine.
Retina's clear, muscles are perfect.
How is my vision, Doctor?
Excellent, Doctor, as we previously tested.
Let's sit over here.
Why are you really here, James?
As I told you, to get my eyes examined.
Let's have another look.
You had the same examination three months ago.
What makes you think your eyes have changed in three months?
Nothing. Nothing yet.
Then this has something to do with your research.
You're planning to experiment upon yourself, aren't you?
All right.
You're a fine doctor.
You know what you're doing.
But you only have one pair of eyes.
And with them I want to see.
You see fine.
Sam, what's the range of human vision?
- Distance?
- No, wavelength.
Between 4,000 angstrom units and 7,800 angstrom units.
You know that.
Less than one-tenth of the actual wave spectrum.
What could we really see if we had access to the other 90%?
Sam, we are virtually blind. All of us.
You tell me that my eyes are perfect.
Well, they're not.
I'm blind to all but a tenth of the universe.
My dear friend, only the gods see everything.
My dear doctor,
I'm closing in on the gods.
Go ahead, Doctor, make a diagnosis.
Foreign object.
Bullet, it looks like, in the chest cavity.
All right. How about this one?
Lesion in the heart area, maybe in the lungs.
Might be carcinoma.
Or a clot. Or just a fog on the plate.
Could be any number of things.
But what is it, really?
Just a shadow play.
A pattern to be used for intelligent guesswork.
A slight help towards saving the life of the man who made those shadows.
Immense help, Dr. Xavier.
When you have nothing better, anything is an immense help.
That's light.
Waves of energy that excite the eye.
And the nerve cells transmit this energy to the brain.
And with the brain, we see.
But there are other forms of energy with different wavelengths.
Dr. Xavier, I've read your report.
Yes, but do you understand it?
Have you any idea what I'm trying to accomplish here?
Dr. Fairfax, I'm developing a way to sensitize the human eye so that it sees radiation, up to and including the gamma rays and the meson wind.
Yes, I understand.
I understood your objective when I first read your report.
Then why are you here?
Because the report in question was dated nine months ago.
Because since that time, you have drawn over $27,000 of the foundation's money and we haven't had a word from you.
- Well, there have been problems.
- Then report them.
To whom, a group of businessmen who can't tell one quantum jump from another?
No, to me.
The foundation found your research worthy of support.
They also appointed me as liaison to these special projects.
Listen, Doctor,
I've given up my own research to help the foundation and I won't be talked to as if I were a child in kindergarten.
I knew of your reputation, but I hadn't heard about your temper.
- Now, Doctor...
- You want a progress report?
I'll give you something better.
A demonstration.
Come with me.
Doctor Morgan...
You can be of some help.
Put these on.
Now, these are hormones, enzymes.
Their megalostructures have been slightly altered.
Prepare that one in number two, the second cage down.
He won't bite you.
It's all right.
Now, this compound, when used in the eye, increases receptivity.
The sensitivity is enormously increased.
- Well, you've tried it?
- No.
Well, you're blunt, Doctor.
The monkey's been conditioned, standard pleasure-pain technique.
Come on.
Come on.
All right, bring him here.
Put him there.
Now, when he sees the white, he'll pull the corresponding switch and the light will go on.
When he sees the blue, he'll do the same thing and the blue light will go on.
And the same thing with the red.
Now, watch.
Nothing up the sleeves.
White, the one he normally sees.
But he can't see the blue.
It's covered by the white screen.
But he does see it.
And the red. He sees the red.
Well, they're both covered.
But don't you understand yet? He sees through them, as if they were glass.
What did he see?
What did he see?
Thanks, Doctor.
Can't find a thing.
The tissues are fine.
The autopsy?
Heart failure, nothing else.
I'd call it shock.
Because of what it saw?
No, because it couldn't comprehend or adjust to what it saw or saw through.
That's all.
No pathology, no degeneration, tissues perfectly healthy.
Dr. Fairfax...
I think after tonight's work, you can call me Diane.
Thank you.
I'd like to buy you a cup of coffee.
That's the best experiment
I've heard all night.
You're on, Doctor.
Do you take it black?
- Yes.
- Good.
Now, you're a pretty good worker.
Why did you give up research and take to moneylending?
I don't lend it, I give it away.
A million dollars before breakfast every morning.
How do your eggs taste then?
Flat.
You didn't answer my question.
I did, in a way.
When the foundation picked me for the job,
I didn't want it, and then I did.
Why?
Because it needed somebody who cared, somebody who would support some of the...
Well, more untraveled paths.
Like mine?
James, why do you want to see so much?
Well, why do you want to go on breathing? To stay alive.
It's much the same thing with me.
I'm curious, intensely curious.
No, I mean the purpose.
How can you use your new vision?
There are thousands of ways.
You're sitting right on top of probably the most important one right here.
In this hospital, there are people I can help.
Help by seeing inside them, as if they were windows.
By seeing their sicknesses with a clarity that would make X-rays a tool fit only for witchdoctors.
Your foundation doesn't like my work, does it?
They want you to appear before them the day after tomorrow.
I'll be there, and I'll bring them much more than a report.
No, it's too dangerous.
Then who is going to try it?
Some student? Some intern?
Yes. Or better yet, some convicted murderer.
Anyone who has less to lose than you.
And how are they going to report it?
"My eyes feel funny"?
"Gee, Doc, I've got a headache"?
That monkey died.
It was a monkey, not a man.
- I tell you, no.
- Yes.
I won't be a party to it.
All right. I'll proceed without you.
Sam.
Sam, I need you.
- All right. When do you want to do it?
- Now.
August 14th, notes on experiment designated "X."
Experimental subject myself,
James Xavier.
Assisting in experiment,
Dr. Samuel Brant.
You ready, Doctor?
Ready, Doctor.
The compound fully described in a written report has been prepared.
Dr. Brant will administer one drop into each eye of the subject.
One drop. Any choice?
Yeah. One in the middle.
Tilt your head and look directly up.
Well, here it goes, James. Good luck.
How long?
Eight to 10 seconds.
All right, open your eyes.
James?
It's like a splitting of the world.
Vision is fragmented.
More light than I've ever seen.
Filled with light.
I have to close them.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I'm gonna try again.
Everything is normal.
Wait.
Sam, I can see through it.
Right through it.
"The exact combination of hormones and enzymes
"is to be determined by analysis."
Good Lord, Jim.
You can!
Sam, your lab coat.
My coat?
There's a pen in your shirt pocket.
And there's a button missing under your tie.
Sam, it works.
It works!
I still have just penetrated the surface.
My eyes are not quite conditioned yet.
But it's a start.
Sam, another drop in each eye.
Not now. There should be tests.
There might be side effects.
All right, I'll do it myself.
The light!
The light!
Well, that's the tape, gentlemen.
And, of course, the reason
Dr. Xavier can't be present today.
I've asked Dr. Brant to represent him here.
Dr. Xavier has been unconscious since yesterday, when this experiment took place.
I've been asked by Dr. Fairfax to speak on his behalf about the continuation of his research funds.
Now, you read the reports, you heard the tape of Dr. Xavier's first experiment.
I think, gentlemen, you will agree that a fantastic breakthrough is possible.
Unbelievable might be a better choice.
Dr. Xavier is unable to speak for himself, but his work speaks for him.
It can and will be repeated by others besides himself.
It is up to this foundation to finance the further work that is necessary.
I must confess to you, Doctor, that I don't believe in the continuance of this work. I mean...
Well, there still is nothing positive that has come out of it.
But, Mr. Bowhead...
I'm very sorry, Dr. Fairfax, but I believe our foundation can no longer channel its funds into this work.
And that's all. They voted against you.
I tried. Dr. Brant.
- Sam and I, we've tried.
- Everything.
They decided to withhold the funds.
So, they cut me off like an arm with gangrene.
- Maybe they're right.
- No, they're wrong.
And I'll show them just how wrong.
We better leave now. He needs rest.
James, I'll order the bandages removed tomorrow.
Bandages?
Yes. I hardly noticed them.
Hardly noticed them at all.
- You'll get your chance again, James.
- Yes, I will.
I think it's for the best, in any case.
You need a rest from research.
A return to doctoring will be just the right prescription.
- Maybe the hospital could...
- No, we've been through it before.
We need all our funds just to keep this place going.
Well, that's it.
I want you in surgery tomorrow.
You'll assist me.
Why, thank you, Dr. Benson, thank you.
It's nice to have you back with us.
You might look in on a patient named Stanton in Ward three.
I've left the reports and the diagnosis on your desk.
Right.
May I help you, Doctor?
Yes, a patient named Stanton?
Yes, right over here.
- Thank you. That'll be all, nurse.
- Yes, Doctor.
He's wrong.
The diagnosis is wrong.
Doctor?
Your eyes.
Go back to sleep, dear.
Pretty, isn't she?
Yes, very.
Doctor, I want you to reconsider this operation.
Why?
You say she has a stenosis.
You're wrong.
It's a tumor directly in the auricle attached to the valve.
Nonsense.
The X-rays were taken from every angle.
Dr. Benson, I know what I'm saying.
You'll be cutting into the wrong area of the heart.
Doctor, I shall expect you in surgery at 6:00.
I will perform the operation exactly as I outlined it.
Thank you, Doctor. Yes, right away.
Doctor, someone...
Are you all right?
Yes, just a temporary headache.
- May I get you something?
- No. No, thank you.
- There's someone waiting for you, Doctor.
- All right.
I was waiting for you.
James, what's wrong?
It's nothing. It's just a readjustment.
Your eyes.
- You're continuing to use the...
- Yes, I am.
The vision comes and goes.
But tonight I saw very clearly, very deeply.
And what the devil are you doing here so late?
A surprise for you.
Bo, not another one.
My life's too full of them.
Come along.
Where are you dragging me?
I have young friends who have a cure.
For what disease?
Intense doctors.
Dr. Holmes...
About 10 ccs, Doctor.
- Exactly.
- Beautiful. Beautiful.
Be my guest.
Here you are, perfect martinis.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Ethyl or gin?
Well, in deference to your high standings,
Doctors, gin.
I think I got formaldehyde.
- It's been nice talking to you.
- It's all right, I love it.
Well, are you enjoying yourself?
Well, who couldn't around you?
My, you're almost romantic.
Well, it's just a passing symptom.
I don't think
I want you cured after all.
My dance, Doctor.
As one of your ex-students,
I have rights.
- That'll be all right.
- Excuse us.
Hi.
Hi, I said.
Hi.
I saw you clear across from over there.
Gee, you've got sharp eyes.
When I use them.
I want you to dance with me.
I like the way you look, kind of urgent.
I like men who look urgent.
- I'll remember that.
- Come on.
Headache?
Headache?
No, it's just my eyes.
You like the way I dance?
It's fine. It's just fine.
Jim? My turn, now.
- Did you find that fun?
- Yes. Yes.
- You know, you're quite lovely.
- Thank you.
Matter of fact, you're very attractive.
Well, one drink certainly makes you a different man.
Well, you could say I'm really seeing you for the first time.
And that's the most interesting birthmark you have above the third rib on your left side.
But how do you know that?
Why, you can see me.
And your backbone's a sheer delight.
But remember, I am a doctor.
Well, you remember that I'm a woman.
I can hardly forget it.
Come on, I'm getting you out of here.
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning, nurse.
Good morning, James.
Good morning, Doctor.
Are you all right?
Yes. Perfectly all right.
Why do you want me here?
I don't know. I think I'm afraid.
Diane, what do you know?
Only that he's been using the drug again.
Ready.
Doctor, you must reconsider the procedure.
Scalpel.
Let go of my hand.
Doctor, I shall perform this operation.
James, have you gone out of your mind?
No, but I want this girl to live.
Second blade. I'm going to continue.
It seems, Doctor, you are now unable to continue.
James, you've gone mad.
No.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
More exactly than any other doctor's ever known before.
You think I'm mad?
Well, watch. All of you, just watch.
You know of my experiments.
Dr. Benson knows.
What I'm doing is a direct result of those experiments.
I can see the heart and the lungs and the internal structures quite clearly.
Doctor, we could stop him.
No.
Swab.
All right.
You see, Dr. Benson, no stenosis.
- Take the patient into recovery.
- Yes, Doctor.
Dr. Xavier, are you finished?
Yes. I'm sorry, there was nothing else I could do, but the girl will live.
Dr. Ryan, will you write the postoperative orders?
You know what you did was unethical.
I had no choice.
You realize that news of it has probably spread through the hospital, perhaps even reached the papers.
You saw what I've accomplished.
I don't know what I saw.
But this I do know.
You will be tried for malpractice.
- Jim.
- Diane.
- You've got to get away from here.
- You're coming with us.
Yes, I'm very tired.
L, T, N,
U, E,
X.
James. James.
Yes, it persists.
The effect is cumulative.
I see veins, organs, the blood rushing through your heart.
I look at Diane, and she appears a perfect, breathing dissection.
But, Jim, there must be some way to control it.
Of course.
Ask your foundation for the money to discover it.
We don't need the foundation, any of them.
- We'll work together. We'll find a reversal.
- No.
That's just what I don't want.
I'm going on.
You can't. I won't permit it.
The drug works upon the eyes.
- They're the direct route into the brain.
- I don't care.
What is happening is beyond my hopes.
A cumulative effect.
Soon, I'll be able to see what no man has ever seen.
And, Sam, I want you with me.
With new eyes, we'll explore all the mysteries of creation.
With knowledge there is power.
The power to learn, to create, to do.
I proved it today.
Jim, who knows what other parts of your mind are affected by this thing.
Sam.
Jim, it's the only way.
Someone has to care for you.
Now, push up your sleeve.
No!
You killed him.
- Yes.
- Jim.
- He was my friend.
- You've got to get away.
But you saw what happened.
They won't believe me, not after the operation.
They'll think you're insane.
Insane?
Insane?
Diane, do you...
The police.
Jim, you've got no time.
They'll blame you no matter what we say.
One of the most fantastic performances ever to appear here in the carnival show.
And you'll enjoy the fabulous things he can do with his fantastic eyes and mind.
Hey, you boys over there.
You two fellows, step right over here, you're embarrassing the girls.
Come on over here and see a show.
We're gonna present to you one of the finest shows on earth.
Big deal.
Hey, buddy, how would you like it if I step on your hands?
Nobody likes a wise guy.
This man, ladies and gentlemen, he can read your mind.
Tell you what you're thinking.
Can he tell me where my wife is?
Yeah, buddy, on a broom flying around the pier.
That's where your wife is.
I need guys like you.
Come on, you people, he's ready to begin.
The man they call Mentallo.
The Mentallo, the man with the miraculous mind.
Step right up, folks.
You're in for one of the greatest, exciting evenings of your life.
Good crowd.
Yes, I know.
All right, everybody. All right, gang.
Here he is, Mentallo.
Write your thoughts down here and he will read them to you just by pressing them against his forehead.
Anything you wanted to write, anything at all.
How about my mother-in-law's will?
I hope she leaves a picture of your wife, smart guy.
Ask him where you get those clothes.
The same Army & Navy store you bought yours. Okay?
Here's a pencil. Come on, gang.
He's a fake. I know how they do this.
The first paper he gets is a phony.
When he opens the second one to check on it, he's really reading the first.
He's one ahead the whole time. Smart.
Smart? I heard that, too.
Everybody, let's feed the monkeys, so we can go on with the show.
All right, pal?
You got a thought, or do you wanna sit there and play with your blocks?
I could play with your blocks.
Here, give him this.
Real smart kid.
I love those kind of guys.
We meet them every time here, but doesn't phase Mentallo.
He'll answer every one of them.
Here we go. Here you are.
This is from a lady who wants to know if
I wear this outfit to pin tails on donkeys.
See? That's the ringer.
That's the ringer, smart guy?
What are you, Dick Tracy?
How about that, folks?
That's exactly what the young lady said.
That's right.
If the lady will step forward,
I will demonstrate.
This is from a man who wants to know how much money he has in his pocket.
- There it is.
- I spent it all to get in here.
If the gentleman will stand up,
I will tell him.
Judging from your appearance,
I would say a quarter.
This is from a young man who says I am a fake.
Would you like a further demonstration of my powers?
- It's a trick.
- Is it?
Your name is John Trask.
You've come from Phoenix.
You're 27 years of age, you're unmarried.
Your social security number is
You have a watch on your person, a gift from your father.
How do you know that?
You also have a letter in your pocket from a girl you deserted.
A girl who loves you.
Shut up.
This is your trick, ain't it?
I have no trick.
You gotta. Everybody does.
It's in the mask.
Can you see through it?
No.
There's a switch or something.
No switch.
Then, how?
Look, you can trust me.
You've been on the pier a month now, and nobody's caught on.
You've got something great here. Great.
Thank you.
In fact, it's so great,
I sometimes wonder what you're doing here on the small-time hustle.
What do you mean?
I didn't mean nothing.
Except, I wonder, what do you want, Mr. Mentallo?
Please leave.
I didn't mean nothing.
Come on, get out.
September 19th, the fluid is almost gone.
I use only the smallest amounts now, but the effect seems to be cumulative.
But how can I work without a laboratory, without equipment, without money to buy what I need?
There's so much undone, so much I don't understand.
He drove them off today like they were scared.
I saw them run from his show.
Said he saw too much.
He's all right, does his job.
He keeps to himself.
Why not? He's got a right.
Does he? We all live and work together.
He gives me the creeps.
Maybe we give him the creeps.
Did you ever see his eyes?
He always wears those glasses and that mask.
Now, Crane hustles for him.
Crane, he thinks he's real.
Real? What do you think, he's a ghost?
Well, what he does is real. No tricks.
- Coffee?
- Sure, you bet.
Two coffees.
He sees not through your mind, but through things like paper and cloth.
- He's got a good act, that's all.
- No.
Yeah, an act. What else could it be?
A man that could really see through things, he wouldn't be here. No, he wouldn't.
He'd be something big, powerful.
He'd be something special.
What would he be?
He'd know secrets. Secrets he could use.
A hold on people, that's what he would have.
Something to make them listen to him.
That what you think?
I never think. I eat.
Maybe he could help keep people from hurting each other.
How?
By telling everybody everything.
No secrets, what's anybody got to fight about?
Same things they've always fought about.
Ideas, thoughts, differences.
I'd stop them.
If I had your power, I'd stop them.
I'd make them do things my way or I'd hurt them all, if I had your trick.
Trick? I thought you said it was real.
Man was real, he wouldn't be here.
Maybe this is all he could be.
This, and nothing more.
Nothing more than just a man.
Fake. Cheap fake.
Don't pay them no mind.
Me, I know what you got is real.
And you, what do you want to see?
All the undressed women my poor eyes could stand.
And you?
What about you, Mr. Mentallo?
First, money.
And then, to be able to open my eyes.
A wonderful performance.
- Green, go get a doctor, quick.
- Right.
She's got a broken leg.
Crane, get some wood for splints and some rope.
She's also got two broken ribs.
How do you know?
Never mind.
Take hold of her, it's gonna hurt.
Take it easy.
- These are all I could find.
- They'll do.
- The doctor's on his way.
- Good.
I also saw two broken ribs.
Hang on to this while I immobilize this leg.
You've got the power, the power to see inside.
Shut up.
- Here he comes now. Here he is.
- Here comes the doctor.
Good. He can take over.
- You ain't no mind-reader.
- No?
But I know what you are.
What am I?
You're a healer. A healer of the sick.
I watched you over there.
You looked right through that girl and you knew what was wrong.
A broken leg shows.
But not broken ribs.
I couldn't see nothing.
Don't you understand?
It means money, more money than you could make in 10 years working on the pier.
You can heal them just by laying on your hands.
You're out of your mind.
But you can look right through a guy and see what's wrong with him, can't you?
You said you wanted money, didn't you?
We could set up a place in the city.
Nothing fancy, no advertising.
Just through word.
When you're poor, the word gets around about a man that can heal just by looking.
And we don't charge them a thing, not one penny.
What about your money then, Mr. Crane?
Donations, Mr. Mentallo.
Everybody gives what he can.
Just what he can.
Here it is.
It ain't much, but you said it don't matter.
Any other rooms?
Two, the bedroom and another storage room about half the size of this one.
- Let's see them.
- Right.
The one in the back is the storage room.
Wait. I'll tell you this once, and that's all.
You will never enter these rooms.
Never, under any circumstances.
All right, all right.
Whatever you say, Doc.
He's there.
It's just like I said, honest.
I'm afraid, Mr. Crane.
Now, you come along.
Maybe he will, maybe he won't.
- He's asleep.
- It won't take a second.
Healer, I brought you someone.
Who are you?
It's me, Crane. Don't you remember?
Yes. Crane.
I didn't mean to wake you.
I brought Mrs. Mart. This is her.
She says she's pained and sick to death.
I thought you might be willing to tell her something.
I have this pain in my back.
It's tight, like a fist. And it grows.
I think it's a cancer come to eat me.
It's nothing. Nothing.
Just tiredness and age, and nothing.
And the pain?
It'll be gone soon.
I was afraid, but you are a good man.
She's going.
She's beyond my help.
She said you were a good man.
I guess she knows.
She's a smart old woman.
She'll pass the word.
What?
You're a healer. You can heal.
I can't heal. I only look.
And I tell what I see.
Sure. I know what you mean, Doc.
But that's enough.
You wait and see.
In one week's time, this place will be so packed you'll be turning them away.
The effects of the compound are still unpredictable.
At times,
I can see through walls, through stone just as easily as I can see through the air.
At other times, I can hardly penetrate the first layer of a man's skin.
Sometimes I wonder why I keep on searching.
I don't want power or fame or...
I told you never to set foot in here.
Yeah.
You got quite a setup here.
You got people waiting, lots of them.
I'll be with them in a minute.
You better come now.
Here he is now.
Here he is.
All right, everybody, just take it easy.
The healer will see everybody in a few minutes.
You, miss.
Hey, hey, you ain't in line.
I'm his friend.
I never saw you before.
I've never been here before.
Hey!
Sit down.
There's nothing wrong with you, young lady.
You're perfectly healthy.
Why are you here?
To see you, Jim.
- Diane?
- Yes.
How did you find me?
I left the foundation, took up my practice again.
Patients. First one, then others.
They came to me for treatment knowing exactly what was wrong with them.
Only one man could tell them that.
It took me more than a month to find you, but I knew who I was looking for.
I didn't want to see you again.
But I'm here now.
Yes. If what I'm seeing is really you.
No, don't. It's worse without them.
- The "X" effect?
- Yes.
Double. Sometimes triple.
And sometimes, when I look up and I see all those people above me, pressing down upon me, the whole of humanity.
And at night, while they sleep,
I close my eyes and I can still see through my own eyelids.
Oh, Lord.
I'd give anything, anything to have dark.
I've come to help, if I can.
You can't go on like this.
They're bound to discover you.
You've got to go away somewhere where it's safe.
No, no. You ain't going nowhere.
I'm not letting you go.
Not when things are just starting to pay off.
Haven't you had enough out of their misery?
Only my share.
My share for keeping you out of the hands of the cops.
I've got my power over you,
Mr. Mentallo.
Dr. James Xavier.
I've known about you for some time.
Ever since we hit this town.
But I don't care.
As long as I get my share.
Get out of my sight.
Get out of my way!
You leave now and I'll turn you in, that's what I'll do.
I'll see you hang, you murderer!
No, you're not gonna get out of here.
I'll tell you that.
You're not gonna get out.
You won't get away!
He ain't no healer. He ain't.
He looks inside you and he gives you the sickness. And you die! Killer!
- Murderer!
- Watch out!
Murderer! Police, police!
What do you see?
This city, as if it were unborn, rising into the sky with fingers of metal, limbs without flesh, girders without stone, signs hanging without support, wires dipping and swaying without poles.
A city unborn, its flesh dissolved in an acid of light.
A city of the dead.
Diane, I'm sorry, but I've got to get away.
I must go somewhere I can work, where I can solve this thing,
- learn to control it.
- Where?
Anywhere. Across the border, anywhere where I can work.
- It'll take money.
- I know.
Would you come with me?
Yes.
You know, across the desert is a place where they have more money than I'll ever need.
And I can get it.
As a matter of fact, I'm the only man in the world, probably, who can get it and get away with it.
You wait here. I'll be back in a moment.
You've taken the drug again.
I had to. The effect is wearing down.
Are you all right?
For what I have to do, yes. Come on.
- Are you nearly finished with this machine?
- This machine's nearly finished me.
It's set to jackpot in two plays.
Here.
- I don't gamble.
- This is not gambling.
Well, what next?
Over there.
Eighteen.
Can't win them all, darling.
Hit me.
Fine.
Twenty. Pay the point.
Twenty-one.
You don't seem very worried.
It's the house's money.
Ain't mine, win or lose.
Blackjack.
Blackjack pays one-and-a-half times.
Hit me.
- He can't lose.
- Again.
Once more.
Fine.
Twenty.
Twenty-one.
This table is closed.
All right,
I'll play over at that table, then.
Give me your bag.
Jim, you've got enough, nearly $20,000.
I could go on winning forever.
They can't stop me from winning.
I'll show you how to win.
Now, wait a minute.
- Deal.
- Cut.
I believe you.
I stand.
Don't draw. Don't draw.
Why not?
Because you've got 16 there.
The next card's a face card.
Jim, please, we'd better cash in and get out of here.
All right. Pay me.
Pardon me, sir,
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Questions?
You won a lot of money.
I'd like to make sure you won it honestly.
- What's it matter to you?
- Jim.
Look! Look!
- No.
- Look at his eyes.
- What's the matter with him?
- No!
No!
Look at his eyes.
No!
Something's real wrong with this one.
Harry, you better go for the sheriff right now.
Jim, they're calling the police.
It's free. It's free.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Attention, James Xavier.
This is the California Highway Patrol.
Attention. You can't escape.
I repeat, you can't escape.
All forces have been alerted.
Give yourself up.
Stop and give yourself up.
All roads are blocked.
Let me sing hallelujah
When he comes, hallelujah
Let me sing hallelujah
Let me sing hallelujah
Let me sing hallelujah
Let me sing hallelujah
Let me sing hallelujah
On that day
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
The children of God.
Amen.
For we are truly God's children.
Hallelujah.
He will guard and protect us against the ravages of sin.
Amen.
Now tell me, whom do we love?
The Lord!
Yes, we love the Lord.
And what do we hate?
Sin!
Yes, we hate sin. We must destroy it.
Hallelujah.
And how shall we save our souls?
Go forth.
Then come forward and save your soul.
Come forward and save your soul.
Are you a sinner?
Do you wish to be saved?
Saved? No.
I've come to tell you what I see.
There are great darknesses, farther than time itself.
And beyond the darkness, a light that glows and changes.
And in the center of the universe, the eye that sees us all.
No!
You see sin and the Devil.
But the Lord has told us what to do about it.
Said Matthew in Chapter Five,
"If thine eye offends thee,
"pluck it out."
Pluck it out! Pluck it out!
Pluck it out!
Pluck it out?
Pluck it out! Pluck it out!
Pluck it out!
Pluck it out! Pluck it out!
Pluck it out!
In a hurry, aren't you?
What are you running for?
You're covered in blood.
How did you get covered in all this blood?
Now, the blood. Now, whose is it, and where did it come from?
Now, come on, come on.
The old Herzeg house.
Outside town.
Yes, yes, the Herzeg house.
Yes, yes.
Cellar.
A man in a glass case...
Head...
Head.
What do you think you're doing?
I'm sorry, sir. One of our men found Dr. Heidecke in his doorway.
His head's been cut off.
- Do you see anything?
- No, sir. I can hear water though.
Well, inspector, I'd say you have the crime of the century.
If that's what you want.
I wouldn't like to have to find the reasons for it.
Well, whoever left this amount of evidence is a fool.
I'll soon find him.
Inspector, I know doctors.
Very few of them are fools.
Oh, so it was a doctor, was it?
Thank you.
Doesn't it look like it?
You can't buy equipment of this kind over a counter.
When I want your diagnosis,
I'll ask for it.
Doctor.
No one's been living here.
There's some rotting furniture, but that's all.
Thank you, sergeant.
Tomorrow I want your men to check all suppliers of surgical goods...
...laboratory equipment and drugs.
- Yes, sir.
I want the names of all their purchasers for the last year.
- Yes, sir.
- And, sergeant.
- Yes, sir?
I want the names of all...
Of all persons listed as missing.
Yes, sir.
The mortuary attendant, sir.
All right.
Now, I understand you've lost a body.
Dr. Herman Streich, I believe.
Can you tell me for certain when he was last in there?
On the day he was taken in there.
We don't keep going back to look.
They're not expected to walk, are they?
I advise you to be careful.
You have just lost a body.
And that's no cause for funny remarks.
I last saw him when
I slid him into the drawer.
Has anybody recently made inquiries as to who you had lying in there?
- No.
- You're sure?
Not a man with a pockmarked face, for instance. Think hard.
No one. Not with pockmarks, warts, pimples or hairs growing out of his nose.
- We don't have visitors.
- Oh, get out!
Give the duty sergeant a statement on the way.
Damn fool.
Dr. Streich could've been the body in the cellar, I suppose.
Yes.
Yes, it ties in, doesn't it?
Yes, but why?
For what reason, eh?
There's one absolute certainty.
We are looking for a doctor.
Nothing is absolutely certain until it is proven.
At the moment, I believe...
...that we're looking for a mad and highly dangerous medical adventurer.
Whether it's a doctor or not remains to be seen.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
You are advertising vacant accommodation?
Yes, that's right.
Please come in.
Thank you.
- It's a cold evening, isn't it?
- Yes, it is indeed.
I'll show you the rooms that are available.
That won't be necessary.
I'm sure any of them will suit me perfectly.
- Well, if you'll sign the register.
- Of course.
Thank you.
Will you be staying long?
Indefinitely.
Thank you, Mr. Fenner.
My name is Anna Spengler.
- How do you do, Mrs. Spengler?
- Miss.
- I beg your pardon.
- Now, may I show you to your room?
Of course. Thank you.
- Do you run this house alone?
- Yes, I'm afraid I do.
That's quite a task, if I may say so, for one so young.
It belongs to my mother, really.
- She's very old now, and she's retired.
- I see.
I only have four other guests, so...
...you'll find it very quiet here.
- She really wailed that time, Dr. Holst.
- It's the worst she's ever been.
- Spiders again?
- Yeah.
Get on with it.
Hold her legs still.
You can take the jacket off when she's asleep.
Good evening, Professor Richter.
Good evening, doctor.
- How is she?
- Not at all good, sir.
I've given her a few hours' sleep.
And what is your opinion of Dr. Brandt, sir?
I sometimes wonder if we're not all wasting our time.
A man has an abscess, we cut him open, see the abscess.
But a sick brain...
We open the skull, all we can see is the brain.
Of the sickness, there is no sign.
I suggest you tell Mrs. Brandt there's no point in continuing to visit her husband.
It is my opinion that he can never be cured.
What a terrible waste.
Madness is always sad.
But for such a brilliant man to drive himself mad...
...what a terrible waste.
A terrible, terrible waste.
Not very talkative, our new resident.
Damn surly, if you ask me.
Only just about managed to say good evening.
My move, I think.
Oh, yes.
Dreadful business, this Dr. Heidecke getting his head lopped off.
The world's full of maniacs.
Ever cross your mind that you never know who you're standing next to in the street?
Funny you should say that.
Today I stood next to probably the worst madman of the decade.
- Who?
- Dr. Frederick Brandt.
Remember him?
Yes, I do.
But where did you see him?
Not in the street, surely?
Of course not. I had to call at the asylum to discuss a new plumbing installation.
I passed him in the exercise yard.
Name rings a bell, but I can't place it.
He's the doctor who caused an absolute furor in the medical world...
...about five years ago with some...
...fantastic and devilish notion he had about transplanting people's brains.
You know, putting them from one person into another.
And he claimed that anyone undergoing such surgery could survive.
Absolute claptrap.
I seem to recall that another fellow had the same idea at the same time.
A foreigner.
- Oh, dear. What was his name, now?
- Frankenstein.
Baron Frankenstein. Lived in Bohemia.
That's the one.
They were both run out of the medical profession, right?
That's right.
And Frankenstein was run out of his country as well.
The church, in particular, pilloried him.
The devil's disciples, the pair of them.
Of course, it was the work that Brandt was engaged on that sent him mad, you know.
- Well, it must have been.
- Excuse me. I didn't know that you were doctors.
- Doctors? We're not doctors.
I beg your pardon. I thought you knew what you were talking about.
You're damn rude, sir.
Stupidity always brings out the worst in me.
- Stupidity?
- Yes, stupidity.
It is fools like you who have blocked progress throughout the ages.
You make pronouncements on half-facts that you don't understand.
I find your tone and manner highly objectionable, sir.
But if you wish to involve yourself in an argument about it, pray...
...explain the word "progress" in this context.
You wouldn't understand it.
I will give you a parallel that you may just appreciate.
Had man not been given to invention and experiment...
...then tonight you would have eaten dinner in a cave.
You would've strewn the bones about the floor...
...then wiped your fingers on a coat of animal skin.
In fact, your lapels do look somewhat greasy. Good night.
- How was your day?
- Terrible.
But a kiss and a drink will help me forget all about it.
- I think the drink can wait.
- If you want to go to the theater tonight you'd better have that drink.
- Come here.
Anna, you're looking very beautiful tonight.
- Thank you, Dr. Holst.
- So let's put the tickets on the fire.
Karl, it took me two hours to get ready this evening.
And I would like to go to the theater.
- I'll get you that drink.
- Right.
Darling, I had a letter from Mother this morning.
She sounds so much better,
I can't believe it.
Darling, I've told you before not to set your hopes too high.
As yet, there's no cure for her, just temporary relief.
I know.
I heard from the hospital treasurer as well.
The fees are going up again.
It's... It's dreadful that you have to buy a life.
Yes.
So long as nerve specialists are in short supply, we'll have to pay a high price.
- Luckily for us, that's no problem.
- But I worry in case you're discovered.
- It's dangerous, isn't it?
- It isn't dangerous, darling. I promise you.
I've been getting away with it for a year, so stop worrying about it.
- But if you're caught...
- I won't get caught.
I'm in charge of the drugs department,
I add a figure here, subtract one there.
It's all right, Anna. Really.
It's the only way to get the money to keep your mother where she is.
The illegal drug market is one source where money never dries up.
Lock this packet in a bureau,
Anna, will you?
There's no point in taking it to the theater.
Where the devil is it?
- Where did I take my coat off?
- On the doorstep.
It must have fallen out there, or in the hall.
Good evening.
I found this on the doorstep.
It appears to have come from the Holburg Mental Hospital.
- Would it belong to anyone in the house?
- Yes, thank you. It's mine.
Good evening, Mr. Fenner.
This is my fiancé, Dr. Karl Holst.
How do you do?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
How do you do?
- The box, please.
- Oh, yes, of course. I'm sorry.
- It's cocaine. Isn't it?
- Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
We've tickets for the theater this evening, and we're already a little late.
- Do you work at the asylum?
- Yes, I do. Now, if you...
Dedicated men, mental health doctors.
Not a very pleasant job, I should imagine.
It isn't. Get your coat, Anna.
We'd better go.
I trust your mother is not too ill, Miss Spengler.
Doctor, is the Hippocratic oath no longer taken in the profession?
- What do you mean?
- What I said.
- Of course it's still taken.
- Oh, I see.
Then I fancy you do not number yourself among the dedicated men?
Mr. Fenner, forgive me, but I can't stand here all night talking gibberish with you.
- Come along, Anna.
- Neither of you are going anywhere tonight.
- How dare you? What right...?
- I have every right.
You're both engaged in highly illegal business.
Illegal business?
What do you mean?
Come now, Miss Spengler.
You know what I'm talking about.
All right, so you overheard a conversation. Prove it.
The Narcotics Bureau would prove it in no time at all.
It's uncanny how they discover irregularities in their record books.
Haven't you noticed?
What do you want?
The penalties for drug trafficking in this country are the harshest in Europe.
As a medical man, you would get not less than 20 years.
And you, my dear Miss Spengler, would get at least 10.
Can you imagine what you would look like after 10 years in prison?
I'm sure you can, doctor.
- How much do you want?
- Oh, I want no money. I want your help.
What sort of help, for God's sake?
Don't invoke the Almighty. I should think he's very angry with you at the moment.
Sit down.
Both of you, and listen to what I have to say.
I can tell you if there was an official body to complain to...
...I would have you closed down.
We've lived here long enough to regard the place as home.
To be thrown into the street without reasonable warning is utterly disgraceful.
And I think in our own small way, we've been very kind to you over the years.
This is an appalling way to treat us.
It makes a mockery of all trust and standards of decency.
Goodbye.
Thank you, Anna.
Thank you very much.
You sent for me, inspector?
Yes, pack your bag.
You're going up to Altenburg for a while.
- With you?
- Yes, with me.
For how long?
Until I say we come back.
Might I be permitted to ask why we're going?
Yes, you read that.
In the Altenburg area, there've been four robberies in the last two weeks.
All from manufacturers of surgical or laboratory equipment.
And enough stuff has been taken...
...to equip something very similar to what we saw in that cellar.
You've killed him, doctor.
Please, tell me!
What happened tonight?
Tell me.
Karl hasn't spoken since you got back.
- What's wrong with him?
- Why don't you ask him.
Karl.
Don't sit here like this.
Say something.
Please.
I killed a man tonight, Anna.
I killed the night watchman.
I didn't mean to.
Oh, God, I didn't mean to.
I panicked.
Anna, I want you to go away from here.
- You must leave this house tonight.
- Not unless we go together.
We can't go together.
He'll put the police onto us at once.
He says he needs me, and after what I've done tonight he has me completely trapped.
But he doesn't need you.
- You must get away from here tonight.
- No.
Anna, my love...
...if we get caught, you'll go to prison for the rest of your life.
Don't you realize the position you're in?
You're harboring a murderer and an accessory to murder.
I won't go without you, Karl.
I'm as much to blame for all this as you are.
It's my fault you took the drugs.
Even if we escape the consequences of this...
...there's no longer any future for you and me, Anna.
I'm a murderer.
I'm not leaving you, Karl.
No matter what happens.
Such loyalty is most touching.
The plan, Karl.
I trust you didn't forget it.
Who are you?
Did you get the plan?
I'll do no more until you tell me who you really are.
What you're involved in.
Stay where you are.
I am Baron Frankenstein.
Frankenstein.
I thought the world had seen the last of you.
So did a lot of other people.
I have work to do, and you will both give me every assistance.
The plan. Where is it?
- In that case on the table.
- Thank you.
Show me Dr. Brandt's cell.
Well, it's here, but he's a raving madman.
- What do you want with him?
- I intend to get him out, with your help.
Then I shall cure his insanity.
You're as mad as he is.
It's utterly impossible.
Your medical education is soon to be vastly improved.
I tell you, it isn't possible.
We had Professor Richter see Brandt and he says he's a hopeless case.
You can take whatever Richter says as an absolute fact.
Richter. Yes, he's a clever man, up to a point.
But he's not progressive.
You mean you're going to bring a madman to this house and operate on him?
Anna, go and make us some coffee, please.
- You don't need her. Let her go.
- I need her to make coffee. Anna.
- Now, explain the layout of the asylum.
- You're wasting your time.
- You'll never get him out.
- Of course I will.
Remember what happens to you...
...and Anna if I don't.
I find it very hard to accept that there's no hope.
No hope at all?
I most sincerely wish there was better news I could give you, Mrs. Brandt.
But I think it best that you should know the truth.
- Truth?
- Yes.
For the last three months, we've had to take the precaution of sedating him...
...every time you came to visit him.
He's suddenly developed the most violent and murderous rages.
He's drugged at this moment.
And his condition does nothing but deteriorate.
We fear...
...that there is nothing more we can do for him.
Are you sure?
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Absolutely.
And I'm going to suggest to you, Mrs. Brandt...
...that you cease to visit him.
For you, it can only be terribly, terribly painful.
And as for Dr. Brandt...
...he doesn't even know that you're in the room with him.
I couldn't do that.
I couldn't just walk away.
Well, I won't press the point, but I do ask you to consider it.
It can only be upsetting.
Come.
There's a woman in cell six who thinks she sees spiders.
When she does, her screams will wake the dead.
See that she's under sedation the night we go there.
I can't guarantee that.
I don't make out the duty roster.
Then find some way to alter it.
Why are you doing all this?
Brandt has a secret that I must know.
In order to learn that secret...
...I must cure his insanity.
- What secret?
We were involved in the problems of transplanting the human brain.
We both achieved it.
Utterly impossible.
I assure you, it isn't.
We both found a way of making a transplant from one body to another.
We corresponded on the subject.
Our next step was to find a way of freezing brains without destroying the living cells...
...so they could be stored for future use.
My research went badly, but Brandt discovered the technique.
He wrote to me.
And we arranged to meet for the first time.
He was to tell me the secret.
Unfortunately, two days before we were to meet, he went mad.
The pressure of his work had broken him.
He disappeared.
Shortly afterwards,
I was hounded out of the country.
It's horrifying.
But it doesn't explain why you were doing it.
We were seeking to preserve for all time the great talents and geniuses of the world.
When they die, their brains are at the height of their creative power.
And we bury them underground to rot because the bodies that house them have worn out.
We want to remove those brains at the instant of death and freeze them...
...thus preserving for posterity all they contain.
It's frightening.
I shall need Brandt's case history.
Get it for me. Good night.
I beg you.
- Let Anna go.
- Perhaps, when my work is finished.
Thank you for the coffee, Anna.
Yes, all right, all right.
Take him away. Take him away.
Here.
What's been taken?
Surgical knives of various kinds, saws, hypodermic syringes and the like.
- Yeah.
- I'd say for certain, your man is a doctor.
Oh, would you really? I'd be most surprised if you tell me what he looks like.
- How tall he is and his weight.
- I'm sorry. I think...
Look, I do the thinking.
You check the stores.
You'd be well-advised to get younger men to patrol these premises.
That last old chap was 70 if he was a day.
Well, what about this knife wound?
Well, whoever did this knew exactly where he was putting the knife.
- Oh, yes.
- Too exactly to be lucky, I think.
Yes. Oh, yes, yes, yes.
We better start by making a tour of all the derelict and empty properties in this area.
Well, come on.
Come on. Come on.
- Which door, doctor?
- Six.
Dr. Holst!
What the devil do you think you're doing?
I'm putting her under sedation, sir.
She's been having a bad time lately.
I had noticed that, doctor.
I will tell you when to give patients extra sedation.
Inexperience I can excuse, but lack of basic procedure I cannot.
Now, come out of there.
I couldn't sedate her.
The principal caught me in her cell.
Then we'll just have to trust to luck.
Be careful, now.
He can turn savage in a second.
He doesn't like injections.
Don't be afraid, Dr. Brandt.
We're not going to hurt you.
There. Don't be afraid.
No!
- Just relax.
- Watch it!
Hold him! Hold him!
- Hold him. Back in you go!
- I've got him!
Hold him! Hold him!
Hurry.
The dogs, Frankenstein!
They'll get the dogs!
Anna.
- Karl.
- I must get back.
You haven't finished!
Now, Mrs. Brandt, there is a most worrying aspect about all this, you know.
Your husband did not escape from the asylum.
He was taken out.
- Taken out?
- Removed.
Somebody removed him from his cell.
How is that possible, inspector?
Now, Mrs. Brandt, I can lay before you the absolute facts.
But we shall proceed more quickly if you'll take my word for it.
Who'd want to do such a dreadful thing?
And for what reason?
Now, at the asylum we learned that your husband was a doctor...
...who achieved a certain notoriety about five years ago.
- Yes.
- In the line of researchhe was engaged upon, he had a collaborator.
A Baron Frankenstein.
That is correct.
Oh, inspector, I've often believed that it was he who drove Frederick mad.
- My God! You don't think he...?
- Mrs. Brandt.
Don't tell me what I am thinking.
Listen to what I'm saying.
- And please answer my questions.
- Inspector.
Now...
...in connection with other inquiries we're making...
...I would very much like to meet this Baron Frankenstein.
Or at least to discover what he looks like.
Now, do you know his whereabouts?
And did you ever meet him?
Mrs. Brandt, I am asking you, did you ever meet him?
Do you know where he is?
No... no.
Thank you, Mrs. Brandt.
I will keep you informed.
- You're late.
- I couldn't get away.
The police have been there all day.
They know he was taken.
They're pretty sure someone inside must have helped.
They're not utter fools.
Our friend is in trouble.
- He's had a very severe heart attack.
- I'm not surprised.
I massaged the heart. He won't live more than two or three days.
If I operate on him in his present condition, he'll die instantly.
Then it's all been a waste of time.
- It's over, isn't it?
- Not in the least.
Just made things more difficult.
But there's nothing you can do now.
On the contrary, I can transplant his brain.
If I don't, it'll die through lack of oxygen.
I must therefore transfer it to a healthy body to keep it alive.
When the recipient has fully recovered,
I shall operate again...
...to cure the insanity.
You can't mean any of that. You can't.
- I mean every word of it.
But that would mean you'd have to remove someone else's brain to do it.
Of course, Karl. How else?
But that would be murder!
You're used to that by now.
Aren't you?
Remember, Dr. Knox had Burke and Hare to assist him.
Think what they did for surgery between them.
Now, I have you.
If I were to put Dr. Brandt's brain in the body of another surgeon...
...he'd be the living proof of everything we were striving for.
Karl...
...Professor Richter would be ideal.
Anna!
It's me, Karl.
- Who is it, Karl?
- Anna!
- What are you doing out here?
- I came down for some fresh air.
- I saw the light on and I came...
- Go back to bed.
Go to bed, Anna!
You must get back to the asylum.
Everything's ready.
Help me carry him down first.
Come on.
Karl?
- Where's Karl?
- He's gone back to work...
...at the asylum.
We've done everything you asked.
Please leave my room.
Give me that key.
No!
No! No!
No!
No.
Gentlemen...
...Professor Richter has been forcibly removed from his home.
It happened last night.
Now, if I might be allowed to finish!
Thank you.
Now, I have reasons for believing that he is in very great danger.
I also have reasons for wishing that the matter receives no publicity in the press.
Now, if you cannot guarantee your cooperation...
...then I should be obliged to take out an enforcement order against your newspapers.
Now, I want no speculation on what the police may be doing.
And more important, I want no comment...
...on what, in fact, I am going to do.
Put the towels there.
Ready, Karl?
Concentrate.
Hold his head. Rigid.
Lower.
All right, same procedure as before.
Speed is essential.
Good night!
Quickly.
Utterly fantastic.
Not fantastic, Karl, advanced.
The transplanting of all human organs is a logical branch of surgery.
But you and your pigheaded contemporaries refuse to recognize the fact.
And now we must bury Brandt's body.
I shall be down for breakfast at 6:30, Anna.
I should like two lightly boiled eggs.
I don't know what they're looking for.
They've been to all the houses in my street.
The police, they're searching all the houses.
This one's a boarding house,
Miss Anna Spengler.
- Miss Spengler?
- Yes.
We have authority to search your premises.
May we come in?
- What are you looking for?
- Can't tell you that, miss.
- Please.
- Very well.
You've come at an awkward moment,
I'm afraid.
I'm having the hall redecorated.
You take the upstairs, you, Keller, take the garden.
- How many people staying here, miss?
- Only one.
A Mr. Fenner.
He's out at the moment.
I see.
I'll look around down here.
Dr. Holst?
Oh, Sergeant Brenner.
What are you fellows doing crawling all over the town?
Can't tell you that, sir.
Bit out of your line, isn't it?
Yes, it is a bit.
I've got a couple of days off.
I'm just helping out my fiancée.
Nothing out there, sergeant.
All right. Wait outside.
- Isn't there a cellar in this house, miss?
- A cellar? No, I don't have a cellar.
I have to put all the junk in the garden shed.
You can hardly get in it.
Nothing up there, sergeant.
Thank you.
He's a better doctor than he is a painter.
Yes, he's mending nicely.
The insanity was caused by pressure on the motor area of the brain.
That pressure must be removed.
And the cells that have been damaged must be destroyed.
Back.
Heart.
Hold his head.
This must be held still.
Absolutely still.
Right.
See to the dressings and bandage him.
In two days...
...I shall wake him just enough to elicit response.
If I'm satisfied...
...then for you it's all over.
He'll have to rest for a short time.
Then I shall take him away.
Ella, why don't you take a holiday?
But you've been under so much strain lately.
- A change would do you good.
- I couldn't.
Someone has taken my husband away.
I wouldn't have a moment's peace un...
Something wrong, Ella?
That man over there buying a buttonhole...
...I seem to know his face.
Hello, Anna. Lovely day.
I'm going shopping.
- Is there anything you want me to get?
- No, thank you very much.
My goodness! A main's burst.
I'll go to the Water Board and get some help.
They'll be here soon.
Anna! Anna, are you all right?
You look...
Go away!
For God's sake, go away!
Leave me alone!
I'll help you again, young lady.
- What happened?
- Oh, water main broke, sir.
- Devil of a mess, isn't it?
- Yes, it is indeed, sir.
It'll soon be done.
We've capped the hole.
It's happening all the time. Old pipes, you see.
- Ruined my plants.
There's nothing more to be seen here. I'm sure you have your own affairs to attend to. Excuse me.
Christina.
Look.
Well, I suppose it could be, Ella.
There's certainly a likeness.
Yes. Yes, it could be.
This will restore him to minimum consciousness.
I only want him to respond.
Can you hear me?
If you can, raise your hand.
Answer me each time by raising your hand.
You are Dr. Frederick Brandt, are you not?
I am Baron Frankenstein.
Do you remember the name?
Good evening.
Are you the owner of this house?
I am.
Could you tell me, is Baron Frankenstein staying here?
- There's no one here of that name.
- Please, don't close the door.
Well, you see, he might be using another name.
Please listen!
My name is Mrs. Frederick Brandt.
My dear Mrs. Brandt, how nice to meet you.
It was my intention to call on you, but you have saved me a journey. Please.
I am Baron Frankenstein.
I beg you not to be afraid.
- Your husband is here.
- Here?
Yes, and he is safe.
You will see him shortly.
I'm sorry I had to take matters into my own hands, but I had no choice.
It was the only way I could save him.
Save him? What do you mean?
- Where is he?
- Now, please, let me explain.
Had I come to you and asked for your permission...
...to have him removed from the asylum and put under my care...
...I do not think you would have granted it.
And under the circumstances, that would have been understandable.
But once I discovered where he was,
I could not leave him there...
...when I knew it was in my power to help him.
Help him?
When it was you who drove him out of his mind.
Even now, you can't leave him in peace.
Where is he?
What have you done to him?
He is downstairs. He is sane.
- Sane?
- Come, let me show you.
Please don't be frightened at what you see.
The apparatus is merely a method of feeding him...
...until he is capable of taking nourishment in the normal way.
- God, what have you done to him?
- He is simply asleep. Asleep and sane.
- He is cured.
- But that's impossible.
- Mrs. Brandt.
- What have you done to him?
Do you think I'd allow you to see this if I were not telling the truth?
Let me go!
Oh, help me! In the name of God, somebody help me!
There is no one in the world who can help you, except me.
And that I have done.
What did they tell you at the asylum about your husband's condition?
- They said there was no hope for him.
- Yes, and they are the very same people...
...who said your husband and I were evil...
...because they didn't understand what we were doing.
They did not wish to understand, and so they condemned us both.
They pilloried your husband...
...and declared to the world that he was mad.
And at last, they drove him mad.
Now, when he was ill, how much did he remember?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
His whole past life had disappeared.
Come with me. Please.
Watch his left hand.
Use your left hand to answer me.
You are Dr. Frederick Brandt?
- Why is he covered? May I not see him?
- Not yet.
The scars of his operation have not healed.
I'd rather you waited until they have.
Your Christian name is Ella, I believe.
Brandt, your wife's name is Lily, isn't it?
Is it Ella?
Is your wife's name Ella?
He's just on the edge of consciousness and cannot speak.
Ask him any question you wish very softly...
...and watch his left hand.
Frederick, do you recognize this voice?
Is it the voice of your wife?
The color of my hair...
...is it black?
Auburn, then?
That's enough, Mrs. Brandt.
We mustn't tire him.
- How? How?
- How is not important.
What is important is that you never speak of this to anyone.
I have seriously broken the law.
He must have complete rest for a whole week.
You can come visit him anytime, if you so wish.
And at the end of a week, you can take him away...
...and start a new life together.
You helped, Dr. Holst?
Thank you.
Thank you.
- What can I say to you?
- Nothing needs to be said.
Remember, don't mention this to anyone.
Goodbye, Mrs. Brandt, and please don't worry. There's no cause.
Pack. We're leaving.
Straight on, then turn right at the next crossroads.
I must have been out of my mind not to come to you at once.
That was very stupid of you, Mrs. Brandt.
- You say that he recognized you?
- He knew his name.
He knew my name.
He knew the color of my hair.
Inspector, up here, quickly.
No!
No! No!
No! No!
What are we going to do, Karl?
They'll be coming for us soon, won't they?
What is it, Karl?
Stay here.
It won't be long before the police discover where we are, old friend.
So you and I must have our little talk sooner than I anticipated.
One hour.
And we shall talk of things long overdue.
- What's happened, Karl?
- No questions, Anna.
I want you to go to the stables, harness the horses and stay there.
But, Karl, I can't. I don't know how.
He's waking Richter tonight.
He'll discover what he wants and leave without us.
And without that carriage, we can't get anywhere.
Anna, by Richter's right hand there's a tray with a hypodermic and a file in it.
I must have them.
When I say, "Why don't you get some rest, Anna"...
...I want you to get them and bring them to me in the stable.
But what do you want them for?
I'll know from the amount used what time he's waking.
When Frankenstein goes downstairs, we take the carriage.
I'd like some coffee, Anna.
- How much longer must we stay here?
- A few days yet.
Well, I think I'll try to get some sleep.
Why don't you have a rest, Anna?
What time in the morning?
Seven. Sharp.
No.
Please.
I mean you no harm.
Frankenstein...
...where is he?
What are you doing, Karl?
What happened?
What have you done to him?
What have you done to him?!
He was awake.
- I stabbed him.
- You...?
No.
No.
Anna.
Anna.
I had to come here, Ella.
I had nowhere else to go.
The letter was the only way of introducing myself to you.
For God's sake, who are you?
I buried my husband days ago.
Who are you to contemplate such a dreadful joke?
I am your husband, Ella.
You'll not recognize my voice...
...because it is the voice of a different person.
No.
No. Who are you?
You asked me, did I recognize your voice...
...and what was the color of your hair?
And I answered by raising my left hand.
I have become the victim of...
...everything that Frankenstein and I ever advocated.
My brain...
...is in someone else's body.
I cannot leave here, Ella.
There's nowhere else for me to go.
Frankenstein will know I could only come here, and soon he will come for me.
I know why he did this.
I must have been at some point where I was very close to death.
He had to keep my brain alive.
He wants the formula...
...that I was going to give him.
I cannot risk your going to the police before he arrives.
I will release you when the time is right.
I didn't want you to see me, Ella.
Please.
- Don't be afraid.
- Don't touch me.
I wouldn't harm you, Ella.
I'm your husband.
Don't say that.
You're not...
You're not anything human.
You'd kill me?
Yes, I'd kill you.
I've been driven almost insane.
Why have you come here? Why?
For revenge.
Do I not deserve revenge?
You may leave now.
Go by the back staircase, and move quietly.
I fancy...
...that I am the spider and you are the fly, Frankenstein.
I know why you did this.
And what you've come for.
Brandt, our work.
Our research, remember?
We must continue together.
Better you had killed me.
That would be my wife on her way to the police.
What you want is on a desk in my study.
The game is for you to try and get it.
Wrong door.
You must choose...
...between the flames and the police,
Frankenstein.
You haven't got long to get those papers.
Only one door left, Frankenstein.
No! Brandt, no!
No! Brandt!
No! Brandt! No!
No! Brandt!
No! Brandt! No!
Another day to live through, better get started.
December, 1965.
Is that all it has been since
I inherited the world?
Only three years.
It seems like a hundred million.
Yeah, I own the world.
An empty, dead, silent world.
More of them for the pit.
Every day there are more of them.
They live off the weak ones and leave them for the pit.
K-O-K-W calling. Come in.
K-O-K-W calling.
I'm on international frequency. Come in.
They can't bear to see their image.
It repels them.
I need more mirrors.
And this garlic's lost its pungency.
There was a time when eating was pleasurable.
Now it bores me. Just fuel for survival.
I'll settle for coffee and orange juice this morning.
But first there is my life to consider.
I'd better replace that garlic.
I need more, lots more.
Better stop off and get them.
I can't afford the luxury of anger.
Anger can make me vulnerable.
It can destroy my reason, and reason is the only advantage I have over them.
I've got to find where they hide during the day.
Uncover every one of them.
Now, where did I finish off yesterday?
Madison Street to 31st Avenue.
Eleven kills over three years.
And there's more than half the city I haven't searched.
They're perfect.
Just wide enough to keep the flesh apart so their body seal can't function.
How many more of these will I have to make... before they're all destroyed?
They want my blood, it's their lives or mine.
But, I still get squeamish.
Wait... that garlic.
I'd better put it back where it belongs.
I can't live a heartbeat away from hell and forget it.
I'm out of gas. That means one more stop I'll have to make.
I can get rid of them later.
Right now, I'm out of gas.
They're still fresh.
But I'll take only what I need.
They've got to last.
They can wait too.
I've got my life to worry about.
Those mirrors have to be replaced before dark.
Square blocks to search.
How many of them still exist?
How long will I have to keep up this search?
I haven't much time left.
It'll be dark in an hour.
And now 12 long hours before the sun will rise... and drive them back to darkness.
Morgan, come out.
Come out.
Morgan, come out. Come out.
Robert, help me!
Another day.
Another day to start all over again.
Virge.
Virge.
God, how I miss you.
The sun's already set. They'll be everywhere!
It's Morgan. Get him!
Do you hear?
Morgan.
Do you hear, Morgan?
Morgan.
Do you hear, Morgan?
Three years.
Three years.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Hey, Virge? Virge?
Yes? Oh, no! My makeup. My hair!
Hey, where is everybody?
- All I can see is...
- Hi, Ben!
I can hear children, but I can't see any children.
Uncle Ben!
Uncle Ben!
Look at Uncle Ben!
Ben! Uncle Ben! Uncle Ben!
- What did you bring me?
- Open them and see.
- Come. Come.
- Go on and open them Kathy.
Take a look at this.
- It's highly theoretical, Ben.
- Theoretical?
Do I have to remind you that theory is the beginning of solution?
"Is Europe's disease carried on the wind?" Is it, Ben?
- It could be.
- And if it is?
It isn't, Virge.
Is that what you really think, or just what you'd like to think?
I cannot accept half-baked theories that sell newspapers.
I'm a scientist, not an alarmist.
You're whistling past the graveyard.
Is that a commentary on my work at the lab?
- We both know how hard you've worked.
- I'm sorry, Ben.
I just can't accept the idea of universal disease.
Uncle Ben, you promised us card tricks.
All right, Kathy. Who can resist that face?
All right. Card tricks. Card tricks.
Robert...
Is it possible this germ, or virus, could be airborne?
Anything is possible, Virge.
The best brains in the world have been running through this thing... with a fine-toothed comb.
The germ is visible under a microscope... but it's not like any bacilli
I've ever known.
In what way?
It can't be destroyed by any process we've been able to uncover.
But with the whole world trying, there must be a solution.
Mommy, when are we gonna cut the cake?
Right now our problem is to cut that cake.
- Hey, Mommy. Mommy!
- Coming. Coming.
The wind wake you up?
It always does.
- How do you feel?
- I'm all right.
- Don't get up, honey.
- I'm not sick, Bob.
- I'll make your breakfast.
- You don't have to.
I'll be all right. Go on and read your paper.
All right.
Sweetheart, look, if you don't feel well, please go back to bed.
I'm just a little tired, that's all.
I wish somebody would find a vaccine.
It's all we're working on at the lab, Virge.
Maybe you better not send her to school today.
All right.
- Do you think you should go to work?
- I have to.
Bob?
Bob, I'm so frightened.
Everything's going to be all right, sweetheart.
- Well?
- The bacilli are multiplying.
That kicks the bone marrow theory in the head.
This specimen shows a higher white count... than when I put it on the slide.
Those cells are still living,
Dr. Mercer, off one another.
There has to be an answer.
You've heard that all communications are ended outside the continental limits?
Yes, I heard.
That leaves it in our laps.
So we keep trying. Where's Cortman?
Well, he should be here by now.
You two stay on this virus theory until I decide it's exhausted.
Right.
- Yes, sir?
- Morgan will fill you in.
All right, sir.
And what did the great man of science have to say today? More of the usual?
Oh, he's trying, Ben.
Just like the rest of us.
And nothing works.
The streets are swarming with truckloads of bodies... that they're throwing into that God-awful pit.
And the dedicated Dr. Mercer goes on... with his plodding, unimaginative approach.
- You have a better idea?
- Maybe.
- At least it involves imagination.
- Ben, it's as simple as this.
An unknown germ is being blown around the world.
It's highly contagious, and it's reached plague proportions.
And you don't believe some of the dead have come back?
Let's get to work.
And why are they burning the bodies?
Why don't they bury them?
Because it's the best known way to control the contagion... to keep the germ from spreading.
That's what we've always believed, at any rate.
- You'd prefer us to believe in vampires?
- If they exist, yes.
There are stories being told, Bob.
By people who are out of their minds with fear!
Maybe, but there are too many to be just coincidental.
Stories about people who have died, and have come back.
They're stories, Ben, stories.
And why are the infected people always so tired in the daytime?
Why can't they stand the sunlight?
Why are they only seen at night?
Come here.
- Look.
- I know as well as...
Look!
- Now, is this bacilli or isn't it?
- It doesn't alter...
And this bacilli is found in the blood of every infected person, or isn't it?
To show me germs is not to refute these stories, Bob.
The point is, if there are vampires, they exist in spite of these germs.
Come on, let's get to work.
Until further notice this station... will continue its around-the-clock coverage of this national disaster.
And now we switch you to the state capitol... where His Excellency, the Governor is speaking from the executive mansion.
Further, I have in conjunction with the Federal Government... declared this state to be a disaster area.
The public health is dependent on the bodies of the deceased being burned.
You must notify the Health
Department immediately... if you have a plague victim in your home.
Under no circumstances should you gather publicly.
In view of the dire emergency that exists, I intend to...
Anything new?
No, nothing new.
Nothing.
Mommy, where are you?
Mommy, I can't see.
Mommy...
- I'm going to call the doctor.
- I said no.
Virge, there's nothing they can do.
- But we can't just let her lie there.
- Well, this way she has a chance.
If you call a doctor, he'll report it.
Do you want that?
Mommy, help me.
Mommy...
Mommy, please help me.
Mommy, help me.
- How can you be so sure she's...
- Blindness is one of the symptoms.
You're not to call a doctor under any circumstances.
No one is to come into this house.
Now remember that.
Mommy... Mommy...
Mommy, where are you?
I've got to pick Ben Cortman up on the way to the lab.
No one is to come into this house.
Now remember that!
No! No! No! Please!
Please don't let him be buried in the pit.
Please, for God's sake.
Don't take him away like this.
You can't! You can't!
- Who's there?
- It's me, Ben. We're late.
Ben, what's the matter with you?
Nothing. And I'm going to keep it that way.
- Ben! Look, let's talk about this.
- There's nothing to talk about.
You think I'm out of my mind.
You laughed at me and my theory.
You might be one of them.
Ben, look, you're ill.
You ought to see a doctor.
No doctors.
You take care of your life.
I'll take care of mine.
Now get away from here.
You understand? Get away from here!
If you're looking for anybody but me, forget it.
- Are they all gone?
- That's right.
Is there any hope from the latest reports?
No, not yet.
But believe me, Morgan, we'll find an answer.
When, Doctor?
We need it right now. I need it!
You're the only one who wasn't afraid to come here today.
What's going to happen, Dr. Mercer?
Is everybody in the world going to die before someone finds the answer?
No, I don't think so.
I don't deny that there's some strange evolutionary process going on.
But mankind won't be destroyed.
The fact that you and I are working here today... is evidence of that.
All right. Let's roll.
When?
When?
I called a doctor. I had to.
I told you not to call anyone.
Bob, she was blind.
She couldn't see.
She kept reaching out her hands, and groping for me.
And all of a sudden she was gone.
And they came... and I tried to stop them. They took her.
I saw a truck out there.
Was that it? Was it?
Yes.
I'm sorry, lady. There's nothing I can do.
Let that truck through. Get out of the way.
Get back, folks. Nobody's allowed out there.
Please, all of you. Get behind those lines.
Look sharp there. Move. Move along.
Make way for that truck. This way.
Hey, you, mister! Come back!
Did this truck just come in from Market Street?
I said, did this truck just come in from Market Street?
Mister, I don't know.
Hey, you don't belong in here. Get out.
- I said get out!
- I want my daughter.
Mister, a lot of daughters are in there, including my own.
Bob, I can't see!
I can't see!
Virge!
Virge.
No.
I won't let them put you there, Virge.
I promise.
I won't let them put you there.
Let me in.
Let me in.
Let me in.
Let me in.
Let me in.
Let me in.
Who is it?
Who's there?
Robert.
Robert.
Robert.
Morgan.
We're going to kill you, Morgan.
Morgan? Do you hear?
Morgan.
Morgan!
Do you hear, Morgan?
Morgan? Do you hear, Morgan?
If Cortman thinks he can get to me by destroying my car... his wits are getting dull.
This convertible would be nice.
Probably handles well.
But I can't think of comfort.
There was a time when I shopped for a car... but now I'm looking for a hearse.
This station wagon will have to do.
Alive.
It's alive!
Wait. Don't run away!
Come back here.
Don't run away!
Come back. Come back here!
Wherever he is, I've got to find him.
If I have to search every street, every house, every alley... every inch of this town,
I've got to find him.
Come back!
Hey, boy, where are you?
Where are you, pal? Come here.
They're dead.
They've been staked!
But these are made of iron, not wood like mine.
Someone else is alive in this world.
But where are they? Where are they hiding?
How many are there? Where did they come from?
Why haven't I seen them?
This is Robert Morgan.
If somebody can hear me, answer me.
For God's sake, answer me!
This is K-O-K-W calling.
K-O-K-W calling.
Answer me.
So you finally decided to come back.
It's alright boy.
Good boy.
Oh, no.
Don't worry, boy.
You're going to be all right. Yes, you are.
There now, we've got you all cleaned up.
You're gonna feel better.
Gonna put you down here now and you can rest.
Got you all cleaned up.
You know they're out there, don't you?
You poor driven thing.
Everything's going to be all right.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
Everything's going to be all right.
All right.
You're going to get better.
We're going to have lots of happy times together.
You'll see. Everything's going to be fine.
What's the use?
Wait, I'm not going to hurt you.
Can't you understand? Wait!
Wait.
I'm not going to hurt you. Wait.
I couldn't be out here in the daylight if I was one of them.
You know that they can't come out until sundown.
Do you want to come with me, or do you want to face them?
- You feeling better?
- Yes.
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Thank you.
- You seem very well organized here.
- Yeah.
My name is Ruth Collins.
I was married.
I lost my husband.
You are alone?
- You were married?
- Yes.
Children?
A daughter.
What are you doing?
Please, stop! Stop it, please!
You're making me sick.
Why do you turn away? Why do you turn away?
- You are infected.
- No.
Infected systems are allergic to garlic.
- You think I'm one of them.
- You will be.
You've made up your mind just because I...
You can't change the facts by talking.
Facts? What facts?
That I got sick?
I've had a sensitive stomach all my life.
I saw my husband killed. Torn to pieces, right in front of our house.
I've been wandering ever since.
Hiding at night. Not eating more than scraps.
Sick with mourning, sick with fear, unable to sleep.
Then you shout at me.
You chase me across the field, hit me... drag me to this house, and to top it all... when I get sick because you shove a piece of reeking garlic in my face... you tell me I'm infected.
- Where are you going?
- Let me go.
You can't go out there. It's almost sunset.
- Let me go, I said.
- You can't go out there now.
In a few minutes the streets will be full of them.
- I don't care.
- At least let me give you a blood test.
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
You must be hungry. I'll fix you some dinner.
- You know, you should eat.
- I can't.
- You seem used to them.
- As much as anybody could be.
I'm not frightened of them anymore, if that's what you mean.
I protect myself against them, but only because there are so many.
Individually, they're weak.
Mentally incompetent, like animals after a long famine.
If they weren't... they surely would've found a way of breaking in here a long time ago.
Come out, Morgan.
Hear that?
That's Ben Cortman.
- He was my friend.
- Your friend?
He was like a kid brother.
If I could find him and destroy him...
But you said he was your friend.
When I find him I'll drive a stake through him, just like all the others.
But you lived through all this.
Do you know why?
Perhaps I was chosen.
That's a laugh.
Or perhaps it's because a long time ago when I worked in Panama...
I was bitten in my sleep by a bat.
My theory is that the... the bat had previously acquired the vampire germ.
By the time it entered my blood... it had been strained and weakened by the bat's system.
As a result, I have immunity.
It's only a guess, but it's all I have to go on.
You don't think that I'm immune, do you?
It's a simple matter to find out whether you are or not.
What will you do if I am infected?
Cure me?
You don't have to answer.
I know as well as you do... it's incurable.
There might be a way.
If not of killing the germ, at least of containing it, keeping it from spreading.
If I had the equipment, the time.
Which you don't.
You are one of them.
I was. And without that injection,
I'll be one again.
What do you mean?
- You found a solution?
- That's right.
Exactly as you said it could be.
I take that for it.
What is it?
Defibrinated blood, plus vaccine.
The blood feeds the germ... the vaccine keeps it isolated... and prevents it from multiplying.
We've had it for some time now.
We?
We?
There are quite a number of us.
And I thought you were alone.
I was going to cure you.
- Does that amuse you?
- No.
Now, I want the truth.
I want all of it. Why are you here?
To find out if you know any more than we do.
You know far less.
We're alive. Infected, yes. But alive.
We're going to reorganize society.
Do away with all those wretched creatures who are neither alive nor dead.
Start everything all over again.
And you want me to join?
You can't join us.
You're a monster to them.
Why do you think I ran when I saw you?
Even though I was assigned to spy on you.
Because I was so terrified of what I'd heard about you.
You're a legend in the city.
Living by day instead of night.
Leaving, as evidence of your existence, bloodless corpses.
Many of the people you destroyed were still alive.
Many of them were loved ones of the people in my group.
I didn't know.
- Is there any way you can get out of here?
- What do you mean?
They're coming after you tonight.
That's why I was sent here.
To prevent you from resisting them.
I'm supposed to keep you here until they come.
- To kill me?
- Yes.
Your new society sounds charming.
The beginning of any society is never charming or gentle.
And you pretended to be shocked at my violence.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Why don't you go on and use it?
Get it over with. Use it!
Get it over with!
Now you know.
What are you going to do?
- What are you doing?
- It's already done.
What?
Look.
Look!
You see? It worked, Ruth.
The antibodies in my blood worked.
My blood has saved you, Ruth.
Do you know what this means?
You and I can save all the others.
We won't be alone.
We'll never be alone again.
You are sure?
Wait.
Don't be afraid.
- Where are you going?
- I have to get out of here...
- and tell them you're not a threat to us.
- You can't go out there.
You can save all of us.
When they come here there won't be time... for questions and answers.
They'll come to kill.
For God's sake, Robert, let me go.
Oh, Robert, please.
Ruth, look. Tomorrow.
Please. Robert.
Tomorrow, Ruth. Tomorrow will be all right.
Robert, no.
- Robert.
- Yes, Ruth?
- What if this doesn't last?
- But it will.
I've already checked it under the microscope.
Wait, I'll show you.
I'll prove it to you. I'll check it again.
Ruth, just take a look at this.
This'll prove it to you.
Ruth, there's no change.
I've double... checked.
- Robert!
- Ruth.
- Ruth!
- Robert!
Ruth!
Get away from her.
Ruth, are you all right?
Are you all right?
Run, Robert! Robert, run!
Run! They've come to kill you, Robert.
Run! Run!
Up there!
There he is.
Wait, you don't understand. Wait!
Get him! Get him!
Wait!
Surround the block. Move! Move!
This way. Hey, over here.
This way. Cover all sides!
Stand back.
There he is! In the church!
Over there!
Hold your fire!
Freaks!
All of you.
All of you, freaks. Mutations.
Hold it.
You're freaks.
I am a man.
The last man.
Robert!
They were afraid of me.
They were afraid of me.
They were afraid of me.
They didn't know.
Don't cry. There's nothing to cry about.
We're all safe now.
All safe.

And how did it get here?
Must have been buried for years and the earth threw it up.

If we can't make tonight, we'll hide it till tomorrow night.

Find out all you can about Karos. At once.
Well done! Bravo!
You mean, there isn't one person here...
...who can give me the simplest facts about Karos?
The foreigners opened our eyes!
What? Hotels?
Of course we have! Plenty!
Watch it, guys!
Guys, ancient stuff!
Greek Archaelogy Department.
- A great machine, eh doctor?
-Expensive too!
It has a diamond at the end.
It'll go through steel.
- Open.
-Open your mouth, woman!
Let's go and watch the tourists!
Good morning...
You are a stranger? Tourist?
Ten drachmas. The lot!
Open up!
- What's that?
-Wait and see.
You think it's all like that? Solid?
It must be nearer the centre.
I'll open a whole...here...
Take the baby out of the way.
Alright...don't shout!
And you'd better eat now.
The food is getting cold.
Scram!
There!
I'm thirsty...Bring me water.
Leave it there.
That's all.
All that work! Damn!
- What are those things?
-How the hell should I know?
Are they worth anything?
Never saw their likes before.
Better get rid of them.
I don't want any trouble.
I'm furious! I never want to see the damn thing again!
Let me catch my breath, and we'll get rid of it!
And the bottle as well!
- We keep a couple for the baby?
-No!
Put them back into the box and cover it up.
Get down!
You want us all to be drinking dirty water?
Look!
Throw the sack away, quickly!
He's much obliged...
You didn't get them?

I'm going with you.
- Better not.
Forthe two us, it would be...
You'd only hold me back.
It'sthe only way to save him.
And maybe even us.
I'll be back in an hour.
What is he doing?
Michael!
Michael! Do you hear me?
We'll save you!
Do you hear me, Michael?
There's no other signal.
We will wait then.
We have travelled billions ofkilometres.
We are almost at the end of our journey.
Time will pass and children will learn that we were the first who had set out on a journey through the Universe to find life on the planets ofAIpha Centauri.
Geneva. Based on the latest news from the World Aeronautics and Space Centre the Ikaria launch maneuvres are running according to schedule.
After 8 years of preparations, Ikaria ceases to be one of Earth's satellites.
Ikaria XB 1 in fact is a small space town forforty inhabitants.
Alpha Centauri was chosen as the destination ofthe mission not only forbeing a star closest to Earth.
The decisive factorwasthat it is similarto our Sun and has several planets orbiting it, where the existence oflife is anticipated.
Throughout its construction
Ikaria orbited Earth as a stationary satellite.
What will yourfatherbe doing on the Ikaria? - Nothing.
How come nothing?
- Nothing.
When they land on some planet, he will collect flowers and animals.
As we all know,
Ikaria will return in 15 years.
Due to time dilatation, however, its crew, to put it popularly, will only be 28 months older.
Mars. Our reporter informs usthat
Ikaria has crossed Jupiter's orbit.
It should leave the solar system today.
Master Computer.
End ofincreased G-force.
Normal regime.
Autoregulation off.
That'sthat.
Get up, girls.
How are you feeling, Stephie?
She was frightened.
- And you? - Me?
Just don't pretend to be a hero!
Especially not in front of yourwife.
The lift offis not easy for anyone.
I thought it would be worse.
Commander Mac Donald to the transmission room.
If you only knew how many things
I wanted to tell you.
I know.
And I'm just saying a lot of nonsense now.
What have you got there?
I picked it up in our garden.
Apebble.
Why...
Why are you looking at me like that?
When you come back...
- I know.
You'll be olderthan me.
I won't like you.
- It's not funny.
You'll look the same.
I'll have a fifteen year old daughter.
What?
Rena! Rena!
Navigation room!
What'sthe matter?
We're losing communication with Earth, hurry up.
I was afraid we wouldn't even say goodbye.
This time, there will be two us waiting for you.
I was so anxious to teach her first steps.
Now, I will see herforthe first time when she's 15.
You can teach herto dance.
She wouldn't thank me forthat.
How are you feeling?
Are you happy that you're finally flying?
It's a pity you can't fly with us.
What'sthe matter?
Never mind.
Give my regardsto Stephie.
Tell herthat...
I wish her a bon voyage.
To Stephie?
- Don't forget it.
Rena...
Rena.
He wanted to confuse the computer.
He ordered smoked bananas.
Dried beefbroth.
- And steak with what?
With honey.
- With honey.
And ice cream on garlic.
- And a steak with honey.
And this came out.
Enjoy it!
This is how our ancestors imagined space food.
Romantics.
Well, I've finished my lunch.
Anthony.
Bon appetit.
It's June 26, 2163.
Morning temperatures around 15 degrees.
- This isthe miracle ofthe last century.
A man of metal that not only...
- Wait, don't touch him.
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy...
Did you take it with you again?
As much as I remember, all crew members may take with them:
Firstly, as many personal items, as they wish.
Secondly...
- This is a personal item?
I have him foreighty years.
It's quite ancient then.
What?
But what will you do with it here, Anthony?
What do you mean?
He always flies with me.
But all the robots here are controlled centrally and are specialised.
Why should I care! Patrick is universal. He can do anything.
But it's good for nothing.
Let's go Patrick.
- Let's go.
Not there.
- Not there.
Who is she?
- The new officer.
What new officer?
I don't know about any new officer.
She's flying instead ofMac Donald's wife. A historian. Why?
Never mind.
I don't know.
Don't tell me that it's not possible.
- It is, but on Earth.
Come on, Peter. Adandelion or a daisy would do, or...
What daisy?
He wants me to grow him a flower.
Forwhom?
- That's not important. - Pardon.
Peter.
- I've got only unicells.
What if you give her a puppy.
- What?
Apuppy, one bitch is in pup.
I would like something...
- Poetic.
And what did the astrobiologists bring?
Nothing but poetry.
Peas, lentils, millet, rice.
Acorns, corn, onions.
- Sunflower seeds.
Asunflower is a flowertoo, isn't it?
I pull, nothing happens!
I pull once more, nothing happens.
I'm in hell, you see.
I look at the casing thermometer.
That's big trouble, you see.
Stop saying you see!
And do you know what I did?
I activated the pulsator.
To full power.
Erik, listen...
Twenty kids and a teacher.
I pull one afteranother!
Really quickly, see?
They're yelling "Mummy"!
The teachertoo, see?
And what happened next?
That sunflower is ready.
Do you still need it?
I don't know.
- Quite nice.
Who?
- The sunflower.
Let's hope he won't change his mind.
When I was his age.
Help him.
Sixty. You have a visitor at the door,
Eve. An important visitor.
Me?
Watch out!
- Don't be scared.
Some flowerwe've made you, eh?
Switch it overto the cabin.
- I can't. It's a private cabin.
Isn't this a bit imperfect?
On the contrary.
You won't get away, Anthony.
I had one after lunch.
- You did not.
You ran away as usual.
Come on.
I had one, ask anyone.
He's telling the truth. He had two.
Yes, two.
- You don't say!
You're all the same.
You'll sufferwith avitaminosis.
One hasto look after you like a mother.
You know I've enjoyed being alone since my childhood.
Brigitte!
It seems strange, but I really did.
I always thought nobody understood me.
Nonsense!
Anthony!
Can you still see Earth?
No.
- And the Sun?
Humans are like the stars.
What do you mean?
Somebody orbit around someone else for years.
Who's orbiting?
That was a metaphor.
- A metaphor?
You're here again?
- Does he come here?
Everyday. What else should he do?
He's so Ionely, no one understands him.
That pin head isthe Sun?
May I?
Go on.
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree:
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
It wasthe lark, the herald ofthe morn,
No nightingale:
Look, love, what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
Where's Herold?
- On duty. November?
Earth.
What day is it on Earth?
It wasthe 18th in the morning and Christmas after lunch.
They must be celebrating the New Year by now.
Time really flies.
It means I am as old as my youngest sister.
Check!
It's strange anyway.
We're flying to Centauri.
Why hasn't anyone ever flown to Earth.
Our solar system is oflittle interest.
Play.
Besides, it'stoo farfrom the centre ofthe Galaxy.
26,000 light years.
Play!
You see, we're the backwoods ofthe Universe.
Michael!
Are you looking atAIpha?
Yeah.
I come here often.
Do you think they're out there?
At least on one ofthe planets.
What do you think?
I can't believe that there's life somewhere like on Earth.
I mean that we will land there, get out from the ship, and they will run to us, waving their hands.
Maybe they don't have them.
What? Hands?
Do you know that Bernard took his piano with him?
Why?
He was in some old music club or something like that, you see.
Stop saying you see, you see!
Don't say it orelse...
And stop doing this! Who's supposed to look at it all the time!
I'm sorry.
I don't know what got into me.
No harm done.
When one looks at the same faces for so many months...
That is why I summoned the Council.
We could not speak about Stephie's pregnancy before.
The crew would become agitated.
It is a risky experiment.
None the less, it is essential forfuture missions.
I should have been informed as second-in-command.
Explain it to me.
- Stephie...
Stephie has been already pregnant on Earth.
That means that my wife... could have flown as well.
If she knew she could...
Why didn't you tell me?
Why?
Yourwife knew it.
She was afraid.
It will be the first case in history.
No child has ever been born under such circumstances.
Stephie isten years younger.
That's why yourwife gave up her place.
Lightly.
Not so hard.
Something should happen.
It'staking too long.
Four months.
We're not even halfway there.
Where is everybody?
Isn't Kubes here somewhere?
- No.
Nobody has been here lately.
Why don't you call him through the communicator?
This way, I can at least take a short walk.
You're getting bored, eh?
It's Hopkins's birthday tomorrow.
Brigitte!
What'sthe matter?
- I don't know what to do.
I hadn't worn a skirt forfour months and now, just look at me!
Turn around!
Walk.
What did you expect!
It turned out really well.
Do you think he'll like it?
Anthony, let us now drink to Patrick!
So that you know that I didn't really mean it then.
Patrick, that is...
- Herold. I am on my guard.
Shut up!
- Herold is here.
I am on my guard.
- What did you teach that robot?
I didn't. He learned it himself.
Will you dance?
I don't like dancing.
- Neither do I.
How are you feeling, Stephie?
Give my regardsto Stephie.
When you come back,
I'll be olderthan you.
You won't like me.
When you come back.
I'm thirsty.
Oh no, I'm too old forthis, my child.
Eve will teach you.
- I will.
This jiggling is not for me.
- Jiggling, eh?
Nina, we...
You're a sociologist, aren't you?
We have...
- Some work for you.
Amoral matter. - I see.
- And a social matter.
The thing is that she's making fun of us.
Who?
- Brigitte.
At first, she kept obtruding.
- Obtruding? - Yes.
And now she doesn't want to decide which of usto choose.
That's really interesting.
- It is, isn't it?
Oh yes. The reason may be that she has a husband on Earth.
This isthe Master Computer.
Report to your posts immediately!
Section commanders report to your headquarters!
All officers report to the navigation bridge!
An object ofthe 7th order detected in the second safety zone!
Somebody turn that terrible noise off!
Distance?
Angle 17.
It may be a comet.
Or a meteor.
It may belong to theAIpha Centauri planetary system.
It'sthe first object from there.
What do you need, Anthony?
Time.
Here's your comet.
Composition: Iron, titanium, germanium and traces of common elements.
Volume: 57,900.
Weight: 15,844 tons.
Alright, but...
And this is how it looks from a close-up.
It contains organic substances.
- That's unbelievable.
And what about signals?
- No response so far.
Maybe it's an unmanned station.
No, it's a spacecraft. An automatic station wouldn't be so large.
It seems primitive.
Just like Ikaria may seem primitive to them. We know nothing about them.
Nothing at all.
- But why are they silent?
They have to see us.
I don't know.
Maybe they're afraid ofus.
Afraid?
Lfthey are afraid, then they are similarto humans.
We can do more than to send the Pythagorean proposition.
Prepare the explorer shuttle!
You can't be serious!
What do we have robots for?
What are they for?
- Wait.
Suppose there are living creatures on that ship.
Just suppose...
What would we say ifthey came to us, opened the door, and out came a dozen machines.
How would you deal with them?
Try to understand that there are things robots can't do.
Humans will be sent to that ship.
Two people.
Who do you propose?
Stand at attention, Erik.
Peterand me are entering into history.
And not only of mankind.
I've been in a similar situation once.
I understand.
- I wanted to give you advice.
You know more than the Master Computer.
I've alwaysthought it didn't exist any more.
What?
I don't know, but I envy you.
The explorer shuttle is ready.
Launch.
Launch complete.
Well?
- Everything's alright.
Activate screen transmission.
We'll keep on trying to establish contact with the spaceship.
It's silent. They may have different communication methods.
Maybe it's a wreck.
Do we have permission to land?
Guide the shuttle forlanding.
We are entering the craft.
There's vacuum here.
Do you see the material?
It looks like some sort of aluminium alloy.
Prehistoric.
I thought we would find something worthwhile here.
Look.
Anumber.
It's from Earth.
Nonsense, this can couldn't fly out here.
Money?
Those are...
Those were humans.
We found humans, CaptainAbayev.
Humans?
It's an ancient rocket from Earth.
From which century?
I don't know. Maybe the 20th according to their clothes.
We found cigarettes, glass, paper.
The women are wearing jewellery.
They all died at the same moment.
How? How did they die?
I don't know.
Everything is intact.
They look as ifthey had fallen asleep.
Find out who they are and how did they get out here.
You should have sent an archaeologist instead.
Tigger, Tigger Fun.
Herold to Ikaria.
Find out what Tigger Fun means, Eve.
Look, Nina.
Tor-na-do.
Nineteen eighty seven.
Complete.
We have first data.
Master Computer.
Tigger Fun, also tiger breath.
Deadly poison with immediate effect.
Does not cause deterioration of objects.
The so-called clean weapon from the end ofthe 20th century.
Tornado, a type of a military missile.
No furtherdata available, stop.
They wanted to get to another planet.
Overthere. There's light there.
Caution, the ship still has power.
- That's not possible.
Why not? Areactor can work a hundred years without operators.
A general.
He was in command.
There'stwo ofthem.
Look he has a back wound.
When they were running low on oxygen, they killed the crew with Tigger Fun, so that they would survive longer.
In the end, they fought one another.
Vultures.
I must be somewhere nearthe engines.
I'll find out.
What is it Kubes?
Answer!
Herold! Help Kubes, quick!
- The radioactivity level is increasing.
What happened, Kubes?
Answer!
At the right, that's from Kubes's camera.
But that looks like...
You always get yourselfinto trouble.
My magnetic boot got caught.
Look, overthere!
Abandon the ship, quick!
There are nuclearweapons on board!
Don't touch anything!
Come on, hurry!
Send them the engine module,
Svenson.
Distance 3,458 kilometres.
- The shuttle is ready to lift off.
Don't stop!
Don't touch anything! Hurry!
Run!
We found people, CaptainAbayev, we found people.
We discovered the 20th century.
Would you send them there again?
If I knew there weren't any humans there.
Humans...
They were our ancestors.
Not them.
Definitely not them!
You can't choose your ancestors.
You know who they were?
Human trash.
That left Auschwitz, Oradour and Hiroshima behind them.
The 20th century.
Do you know it?
Honegger.
Also the 20th century.
We had to continue in our journey.
Svenson and Michael were to supervise the installation of a reserve engine.
During such work they have to go out into space on Ikaria's surface.
They weren't there long, only some ten orfifteen minutes.
Under normal circumstances, this would be an insignificant episode.
Thus, no one knew that this moment was the beginning oflethal dangerto us.
It entered into Ikaria with them.
How does it look out there, Erik?
Alright.
- The robots will do the rest.
That'sAIpha Centauri.
There must be at least two planets in the ecosphere.
In the sphere oflife.
Do you think so?
I know, I calculated it.
Yet, the temperature will be high on both the planets, like on our Venus.
But life could be there, because...
I'm not a prophet, I'm a mathematician.
We will find out in...
- In fifty-six days.
Precisely.
Milek...
It's normal.
Will you have a girl or a boy?
Aboy.
How will you name him?
Wait.
Wait...
Do you know which name is really nice?
Michael.
Anthony!
Anthony!
Listen.
A radio nebula.
Grandpa has caught a nebula again.
Golly, are we supposed to survey every smudge?
Yes. Every single one.
Alert! Third deck! Lying person!
Non-responding person!
That can't be possible.
Alert! Non-responding person!
Who is it?
- Dead person! Dead person!
Michael.
Dead person! Dead person!
I...
I must have fallen asleep.
Well, well.
I was on my way from the observatory and all of a sudden...
And that stupid computerthought...
Never mind the computer,
I thought so too.
Dead person on board.
And it will be surrounded by a large garden.
Without paths?
There will be grass everywhere, very high grass.
Report it next time orthe computer will take you as dead with no lunch.
I don't know how it could happen.
I knew one geologist once.
He fell asleep on an asteroid.
On asteroid 608.
Gosh, the whole zone was on alert thinking he went missing.
At least 150 ships were looking for him.
And I'm not counting unmanned crafts.
I will lie on my back and look at the clouds.
Ants will be crawling on the grass.
- And it will start raining.
But we won't run for shelter, will we?
We will stay outside.
Raindrops will be running down our neck.
Erik!
I'm telling you I'm alright.
I've neverneeded this all my life.
And I'll never need it!
- Very well, go.
It is not a disease.
I'm doing what I can.
What about biological separation from Earth?
That's out ofthe question nowadays.
- And time dilatation?
That's an abstract theory, mathematical.
Will it continue?
Is it dead?
- Sleeping.
Stephie, honey, what's wrong with you?
Nothing. Leave me alone.
- Do they know anything?
And the doctor?
What ifthe baby...
We did not know what was happening to us.
We were not able to cope with it, the fatigue, the drowsiness.
We were forced to activate more and more automatons to keep Ikaria running normally.
It was then when Hopkins revealed that while focusing the telescope, several stars kept disappearing and reappearing.
There was something between them and the Ikaria.
A gigantic body.
A Dark Star, to be more precise.
We didn't have the slightest idea ofits existence until then.
It came to light that the nature ofits radiation...
The nature ofits radiation is simply beyond anything we know.
It is certain that its radiation causes attenuation ofbiochemical processes in living organisms.
Inducing fatigue and drowsiness.
- Where is it?
How long will the effect last?
We don't know that.
Or do we?
Here are 14,000 metres of reports from labs, the observatory, astrobiologists.
Some ofthem are the first oftheir kind and Earth has no idea about them.
What now?
Will we send them to Earth?
What for? Why should we worry them for nothing?
But what if we don't come back?
Nonsense.
It's hard to believe that a star could affect the fate of our mission.
But Earth knows nothing about the Dark Star.
The next mission would encounter it again.
It will be better ifwe do it.
- Alright.
In the old days, castaways used to throw bottles into the sea.
We will send a module.
Yet are we castaways?
Try to understand, if we all fall asleep it will take decades before people get there, where we are right now.
We're not on a holiday cruise!
Each of us knew what he was in for!
- Stop yelling.
Alert! Second deck!
Non-responding person, dead person!
I want tough men here.
That's all.
You can't blame anyone forthis.
I know, but...
Those who want, will survive.
And those who don't...
Michael.
When I know that it's a disease, that it has a name,
I will respect it.
Until then, it doesn't exist forus.
Isthat clear?
They insisted that nothing new could be discovered in the Universe.
They've been proclaiming that for300 years.
Fools.
But it can.
It can.
Why...
Why couldn't it.
Anthony!
How long will it take us to get out ofthis?
Anthony! Do you hear me?
Sixty hours.
And then?
And then?
I don't know what will happen then.
Will we wake up?
Do you believe it?
I believe it.
- It's not about belief.
Beliefis nothing.
Beliefis a mere word.
Tell me how to endure.
Tell me when and how will we wake up.
What isthe probability, what certainty.
That's my belief. Understand?
Prepare for 60 hours of sleep.
Is that all we know?
Where are you going?
To get the Ikaria back.
You think I'm afraid.
No, I'm not afraid.
Honestly.
I'd just...
I'd just love to hear those words, you know.
That we made up together.
Nobody knowsthem here.
Nobody knowsthat...
I am yourtwinklet.
And your...
No, I really don't have to be brave.
I will only fall asleep.
You will hear me when I wake up.
It may take long before you find us.
Maybe you won't...
No, you will hear me.
One day...
You will hear me.
I am glad I went on this mission.
Only those sweet words.
Those words you made up for me that nobody knew here.
Master Computer.
Message for Earth recorded.
I will get herback.
She will fly alone.
Back to the Sun.
They will find her.
I must get her back.
Mac Donald!
You don't have the right.
You don't have the right!
Do you understand?
This is ourlast chance.
I want to save the Ikaria.
But we will wake up.
Believe it.
We will wake up.
Master Computer proceeds with the autoregulation process.

Do not take fruit.

Anthony.
End ofthird shift.
First shift unmanned.
Master Computer proceeds with the autoregulation process.
Normal regime.
Good morning.
Everything is alright.
It isn't.
We slept only twenty-five hours.
Not sixty.
Eve!
Stephie!
Stephie.
That's the only explanation.
Some kind of a force field was generated between the Ikaria and the Dark Star.
Eat!
Aforce field that intercepted the radiation.
That's why we woke up earlier.
- Eat, Anthony.
What?
- Eat!
I think there must be a more simple explanation.
Our organism simply got accustomed to it.
Accustomed? It got accustomed to radiation in just a few hours, eh?
Perhaps your organism did.
Mine can't even get used to this mash all the way.
You'll sufferwith avitaminosis.
- Beware, though.
Where did the force field that protected us come from?
Maybe it's just a coincidence, Anthony.
Coincidence?
Coincidence exists among us humans, but not among the stars.
Finish your meal.
The main thing is we got out ofit without consequences.
Just imagine mankind would have sent
Ikaria on this mission without a crew.
It would be on herway back.
The automatons would have turned it back.
Fortunately, man is not as perfect as a machine.
Therefore, he has nothing left than to hope and believe.
Blood circulation disorders.
Functional disorders ofthe higher nervous system.
Will you get him out ofit?
I don't know. It's not a disease, not in the earthly sense ofthe word at least.
It is...
- The second stage?
The effect ofthe Dark Star's radiation.
- It means we're all in thistogether.
No. Erik was exposed to direct radiation when installing the engine.
And where is Michael?
They were both out there.
Where's Michael?
- I don't know.
Have you seen him?
Was Michael here?
- No. What's the matter?
Have you seen Michael?
Navigation bride, find Michael!
You aren't afraid, are you?
It's not that bad.
We only fell asleep.
But those two outside, they were fully exposed.
To the radiation ofthe Dark Star, understand?
We were protected by Ikaria's shield, we are alright.
We are. But what about him?
Michael is in the corridor on deck zero.
What is he doing there?
- I'll have a look.
Michael!
Michael.
What are you doing here?
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!
Come with us.
- You're sick.
Leave me here.
I'm dead.
We will all die, but I don't want to die!
I don't want to go with you!
No!
Michael!
Deck zero closed.
Alert! Alert!
Block the access to the explorer shuttles!
Michael wantsto return to Earth.
Where is he?
He destroyed his transmitter.
Michael, do you hear me!
Stop, we want to help you!
- He's coming back.
I can't see him now.
He's at the robot station.
He deactivated the robots.
But that means we're done.
He doesn't know, what he's doing.
He can destroy the cooling system.
Emergency mode.
- Orthe oxygen regenerators.
For all zones!
We must get to him.
But how?
- I might have a solution.
More to the left.
- To the left.
Retreat, Patrick!
- He has a blaster.
Abayev!
Abayev!
- What is it?
I can't see it.
I can't see it.
- What, Michael?
Earth.
We will be there soon.
Don't lie!
Earth is gone.
Earth never existed!
Michael!
Halt, Michael!
Michael!
I'll get to him. - How?
- Through the air shafts.
Will it work? - It will.
- But... - I constructed them.
Be on guard, he has a blaster.
- I know.
I'm going with you.
- Better not.
It's not fortwo...
You'd only hold me back.
It'sthe only way to save him.
And maybe even us.
I'll be back in an hour.
What is he doing?
Michael! Listen to me.
Michael!
Michael!
Michael!
There's no other signal.
We will wait then.
We have travelled billions ofkilometres.
We are almost at the end of our journey.
Give it to Stephie.
- What?
In memory of you?
- No, to safe keep it forme.
Look what it did to their spacesuits.
And they were outside only ten minutes.
Burnt by the radiation.
Will you save him?
I will.
I will save him.
Apebble.
It's from their garden.
When do you expect the baby?
He must be there by now.
Michael.
Do you hear me?
I came for you.
Listen.
You blocked the robot station.
You're threatening our lives, the whole ship.
You're sick, understand?
You're just sick.
You must come with me, you'll get better.
Are you listening to me?
Michael?
You do want to return to Earth with us, don't you!
Earth is gone.
Earth is gone.
- Earth isthere, Michael.
It's far away, but it'sthere.
Why don't you let me go back then!
I want so see it.
- So do I, Michael.
We all do. That's why you have to let me in the robot station.
That's why you have to get better.
- I can't go on any more.
I don't want to go with you.
Give me the explorer shuttle.
I'll go back.
Tell them, go.
I'm not going without you.
Go or I'll...
You'd kill a human.
A human.
No!
Come now, let's go.
Do you know you destroyed
Hopkins's Patrick?
Don't forget to apologise to him.
Will they save him?
It's that nebula again.
How is Stephie?
Go to the observatory, you're no help here anyway.
I know, but just in case...
Isthe baby born?
Well?
Not yet.
Go to the observatory, you're no help here anyway.
Anthony.
That force field is moving along with the Ikaria, Anthony.
We're enclosed in it like a ship in a bottle.
And that.
Those radar signals are no nebulae.
What are they then?
I... we don't know.
How about Saint Peter, you haven't discovered him yet?
That surprises me.
Let's have a look at it.
I would like to introduce our new crew member.
The assumption that it was a radio nebula, was quite logical.
Yet fallacious.
In fact, it is an energy transmitter.
What transmitter?
As soon as we entered the sphere ofthe Dark Star, it located us.
Enclosing us in a force field that shielded the Ikaria from radiation.
But that means...
Anthony!
There's life on the White Planet!
Do you hear me?
Yes. I know.
- Anthony!
That's it.
The White Planet.
Aworld ofbeingsthat helped us, when we encountered the Dark Star.
We set out into the Universe to discover life, while life discovered us.
Master Computerproceeds with the flight regulation process.
Entry into orbit from the original trajectory in nine minutes.
Attention, entry into orbit in nine minutes.
Explorer shuttles ready.
In an hour, we will be standing on...
No, not on earth.
On...
Perhaps on grass.
Or...
I don't know.
In an hour.
Well, that's a novelty, your refusing anything with alcohol in it.
I'm not used to seeing you sober this time of day.
If you're trying to humiliate me, you did that years ago.
Everybody knows I drink.
I don't try to hide it.
Drinking and my feelings for you are both bad for me.
I know that.
What can I do?
I can't reach you without crawling into the bottle.
When I'm there,
I can at least pretend that you love me and that our marriage is what a marriage is supposed to be.
It's interesting to watch a bottle baby defend her weakness.
One thing I can say for you, your approach is always different.
Today it's complete submissi髇.
I can't even get a rise out of you.
You know, I think I like you better when you're sloppy drunk and violent.
That's the real you and that's the one I like, the one that hates me and gives me a chance to hate back.
Ah!
Now, that's when we're at our best, when we cut through the superficial surface and get down to the fact that we're a cruddy pair.
The only difference is
I know what I am, and you...
You try to hide what you are in the fumes of whiskey.
Did you say whiskey?
Here's to you, whiskey, the guardian of all frustrated wives.
Now, be a good girl and take your guardian and go home.
I've got some experimenting to do.
You know I don't like to be distracted when I'm working.
Unless, of course, you've changed your mind about helping me with my experiments.
You need more than me to be successful in whatever you do.
Just go on butchering your guinea pigs.
They can't put you in jail for that.
As a doctor, I resent the word "butchering" almost as much as I resent looking at you.
I don't know why you came here today, but whatever it was, speak up and then get out!
You know something?
I've just decided to do you a big favor.
I'm going to give you that divorce, so you won't have to look at my face any longer.
I tried making it over for you.
Plastic surgery can't bridge that 10 years between us.
Only love could make you look at me differently, and you never had that, not even in the beginning.
You're...
You're getting sloppy.
Another couple of drinks and you're liable to forget about the divorce and we'll be right back where we started from.
Go on home.
Call Neil and tell him to start the proceedings.
Tell him to use any grounds, whatever he wants.
Just let him get on with it.
You've got what you want.
Why can't I have a little one for the road?
Just enough to make me numb.
I think that did it.
I can't feel anything, inside or out.
I beg your pardon.
Doctor, there's someone in the office to see you.
That's all right, Sally.
Mrs. Talbot was just leaving.
Yes, l...
I was just leaving.
Finally.
Well, I know you advertised for old women, but the one in the office looks like she came right out of a mummy's tomb.
There's something peculiar about her.
She gives me the creeps.
Old women always give me the creeps, but remember, it's worth millions if I can ever find a way to make them young again.
Shall I show her in?
Yes, but first get rid of that glass and that bottle.
Neil?
I'm on my way home now.
Can you meet me there in about 30 minutes?
No.
No.
No, everything's the same.
I'm afraid it's all over.
Yeah.
Goodbye.
Mrs. Talbot, you will never divorce your husband.
You won't have to. He will die.
His death will give you life, a new way of life.
You may run away but you're gonna never escape me.
You are the one in my dreams of blood.
There. That's all.
It's remarkable.
Corpuscle count, blood pressure, teeth, all indicate extreme old age.
Would you help her up?
I'd be tempted to believe you if you had a birth certificate.
That is my birth certificate.
The brand of the Arab slaver who stole me and my mother from Africa, and sold us across the sea
140 years ago.
140 years ago?
I was more fortunate than most.
My mother comforted me.
I learned much from her, things that you'd want to know.
What things?
When we are alone,
I will speak.
Sally, would you mind?
Now, what did you learn from your mother that you think could be of value to me?
I am of the Nando people who once lived in Tanganyika, beyond the Kalambo Falls.
I thought they were all dead, but now I hear that many of my tribe still live deep in the wilderness.
I want to go to them.
You will give me the money to go.
And why should I do that?
Are you not trying to find a way to make the old young again?
Only to make them younger.
Nothing can reverse the aging process.
Nothing that you would know about.
Help me down, please.
This is all that remains of my inheritance, a few pinches of the life-giving Nipe my mother left me.
Nipe? What is it?
I don't know.
All that I know is that it has kept me alive many years beyond my time.
And if I would be young again,
I must return to my people.
Are you saying this powder will make you young again?
No. That slows the approach of death.
There is another substance that must be mixed with it to make one young.
I don't know what it is. It's the secret of the high priest of Nandos.
I'm a man of science.
I don't pay for mumbo jumbo.
I won't take any more of your time.
You can get your coat.
Then return the Nipe.
There are other scientists.
One might even ask for a demonstration before he tells me to go.
A demonstration?
Get me a glass of water.
Now we must wait a few minutes and then you can examine me again.
Then you will see for yourself if the Nipe hasn't slowed the aging process.
All right. I'll run the tests again.
If this powder does as you say, you'll have all the money you need to return to your people.
Mrs. Talbot, I know this is painful, but it's one of those things that have to be done when you plan a divorce.
Now, you and Paul own everything jointly.
Is that right?
Then let's start with the furniture.
Could you set a value on it?
It's trash. Everything's trash.
It'll make a difference to you later on, believe me.
Nothing makes a difference.
It's all old trash.
Like me. Old trash.
I think you've had it for tonight.
You get some sleep.
No.
I'll take you up to your room.
No, I don't want you to go.
Mrs. Talbot, please...
Don't, please don't leave me alone.
Mrs. Talbot.
No, no.
You know something?
You know what she said?
She said, "You are the one in my dreams of blood."
That's what she said.
I'm gonna get you a doctor.
No.
You're drinking yourself into the DTs.
No, I don't want...
Now, come on.
I don't need a doctor.
Sit down here while l...
I don't want a doctor.
Neil, I'm glad you're here.
You're just the man I wanted to see.
Well, since I'm representing your wife, don't you think it would be more ethical if you got another attorney?
What for?
Your divorce.
Divorce? Who said anything about a divorce?
Come, both of you. Let's go to the bar.
I've got a story to tell you that's fantastic.
Come on, June, sit down.
You're looking at the most powerful concentrate of hormone known, a hormone that retards aging.
Now, a similar hormone was first discovered in insects by a British biologist
20, 25 years ago.
Common silkworm produces it.
The only trouble with that hormone is it works only in insects.
This works in humans.
It's kept a woman living more than twice her normal span of life.
She's 152 years old, Neil.
She was in my office this afternoon.
152 years old?
I've confirmed it.
Where did she get this?
A plant that comes from Africa.
Now, she also mentioned another substance which, when mixed with this, will actually make old people young again.
Paul, you talk as if you believe this were possible.
I do. Enough to go to Africa to try to find the source.
June, I want you to come with me.
That is, if you can forgive all those awful things I said to you this afternoon.
June, I need you. You've got to help.
I can't do it alone.
You mean you don't want a divorce?
Of course not.
I'll make it all up to you.
What an idiot I've been not to realize how important you are to me.
Just think.
The trip together, the new country, the jungle, it'll be so exciting.
Oh, Paul. You're my life.
You've just pulled me out of the bottom of the pit.
Honey, if you ever let me go again, it'll be the end of everything for me.
Darling, don't think of such things.
Just think of our being together and how much I love you.
Yes, I know of the Nando people.
They're a savage, proud race.
They refuse to accept anything from our so-called civilization.
They have an undying hatred for Europeans.
The government has issued orders to respect their territory and leave them strictly alone.
So I was told at the consulate.
Then why come to me?
I've heard you're a gambler.
What a great gamble.
If I don't get killed by the Nandos,
I lose my license as a guide, so what's to win?
$5,000 now and $20,000 more if I find what I'm after.
Doctor, that's a lot of money, but I'm afraid I cannot do anything for you.
No one can.
How do you know what I'm looking for?
It's obvious.
You haven't said a word about guns or wildlife and you're not the first scientist to ask me about the Nandos.
That can only mean one thing, Doctor, the legend that they have a secret process to retard age.
Dr. Talbot, as much as I would enjoy earning your money,
I cannot help you find something which doesn't exist.
I'm not asking for your advice or opinion.
I'm merely seeking your services as a guide.
Your insistence does not impress me, but your money is most persuasive.
Doctor, you've got yourself a guide.
Now, come to think of it, about three days ago an old Nando woman came through here and hired bearers to carry her back to her tribe.
Did you see her?
No. She was in a litter behind curtains.
Never showed herself.
But I heard she was old.
Very old.
Must be Malla.
Do you know her?
Yes, yes.
And if we could overtake her,
I'm sure we could get a friendly introduction to her people.
Well, that means starting at once and traveling fast.
Take a look. See them?
Now, that's the Kalambo.
We'll cross over and make for the falls.
Now, we should be right about...
Right about there?
That's right. Another half-day's journey will bring us to the falls, right here.
We'll cache most of our supplies there and leave Ladu with a guard.
The rest of the carriers we'll send back.
We three go on.
Well, have a good night's rest.
Good night.
Ladu.
Another long day tomorrow.
You'd better get some sleep.
Are you angry with me?
Should I be?
You haven't been civil to me since we started this trek.
June, don't start imagining things.
I don't have to.
This time I know it's not my fault.
I've done everything I could to please you, and still you avoid me.
You seem to take a sadistic pleasure out of making me miserable.
Don't leave me like a wounded animal to suffer.
You're gonna tell me why you've been acting like this.
Look, I didn't ask to come along here with you. This was your idea.
Now, you tell me why you're torturing me.
I wasn't aware that I was torturing you. I'm sorry.
Sorry's not enough.
I'm leaving tomorrow with the carriers,
Paul. I mean it.
June, June.
You can't do that.
You don't know how important you are to me.
Why, you... Your leaving would spoil everything.
Why can't you always be like this?
I love you so much, Paul.
There's nothing in the worid
I wouldn't do for you.
Paul, I'd even die for you.
What good would that do?
I want you to live for me.
We'll work together and when we discover the Nandos' secret of rejuvenation,
I'll make you young again.
You'll be beautiful.
Just as beautiful as you were when we first met.
How stupid I've been.
Of course
I'm important to you.
And you really do need me, don't you?
Where else would you get a guinea pig who can talk?
Who can tell you how she feels?
How desperate I must have been to listen to your lies.
And believe them!
June, June...
You keep your hands off of me!
I'll see you dead before I let you touch me again.
Ladu. Where'd she go?
Go get her.
Bring her back.
What's the matter?
It's June. She's run off.
Now, now, now, now, it's all right.
Now, try and get hold of yourself.
Look, the leopard's killed and you are safe.
Come. Come.
There's only one trouble with running away.
You always meet yourself when you get there.
Now, come on.
Let's get back to camp. Come.
I think we'd better take a look.
Get your gun.
Ladu.
Hey, what's that?
It's Malla's.
She had this cane in my office.
Ladu.
Nandos.
Looks as though your friend Malla met a welcoming committee.
Yes, but her body isn't here.
What worries me is why these bodies are still here.
There are plenty of hyenas and vultures around.
What do you mean?
Something's been frightening the scavengers away.
Ladu?
Ladu.
Ladu.
Ladu.
Ladu!
I think we'd better get back to camp.
Ladu.
Ladu.
What do we do now?
I don't think we're going to have much choice.
That man isn't alone.
We'd be dead already if he wanted to kill us.
Give me your gun.
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm all right.
They're working themselves up for something.
Maybe we're the "something."
You don't know how right you are.
I think we're about to have company.
It's Malla.
She'll help us. You'll see.
I hope you're right.
We'll need it.
Dr. Talbot, we meet again.
I've been expecting you.
Then tell your people to set us free.
We're not here to do harm to anyone.
I've come to help...
I know why you've come.
You're searching for the source of the sacred Nipe.
I will show it to you.
An orchid.
A species that grows only in this region of Africa.
Look, the pollen.
A rare plant.
It takes years to harvest even a few ounces of the pollen.
Then it is aged five years more.
That flower, the plant, they're still alive.
It is too valuable to destroy.
I must have it.
For that one plant and permissi髇 to go,
I'll give your people whatever they want, money, cattle, guns, anything.
Why in such a hurry to depart?
Didn't I tell you that there was even a greater secret?
Don't you want to see me made young again?
Of course I do, but I never dreamed it could be possible.
I came here to die, Dr. Talbot, but before the old women of Nandos die, they receive the final gift of youth again, a few days of happiness and love before they wither to dust.
You're a scientist.
The greatest gift that I could give you would be to let you witness this.
Yes. If I could see it,
I would believe it.
Tonight, you, your wife and guide will share the Nando secret.
Then you will sell me the orchid and let us go.
For you, white men, and you, white woman, you are about to witness that which none other than the Nandos has ever seen before.
For a man, old age has rewards.
If he is wise, his gray hairs bring dignity and he's treated with honor and respect.
But for the aged woman, there is nothing.
At best, she's pitied.
More often, her lot is of contempt and neglect.
What woman lives who has passed the prime of life that would not give her remaining years to reclaim even a few moments of joy and happiness, and know the worship of men?
For the end of life should be its moment of triumph.
So it is with the aged women of Nandos, a last flowering of love and beauty before death.
He's drugged.
He's lanced the pineal gland deep in the cerebellum.
He's adding the pineal hormone to the Nipe.
It's a trick.
It's another woman.
No, no, it's Malla.
It's impossible.
It can't be the same woman.
I believe it is.
They took a man's life to do it.
Now you have seen the secret of the Nandos as I promised.
How do we know you're Malla?
Do you remember the mark of the Arab slaver that I showed you in your office?
I knew I was right.
Malla, you've got to help me take your secret back to the States.
It is the one secret that will never leave my people.
When I die, you, too, shall die.
Enjoy the night while you can.
Until morning, I grant anything you may wish, save freedom.
Malla, could you make my wife young again?
Yes, but she must choose the man for the sacrifice.
I could never do that.
Think well before you refuse an opportunity as rare as this.
I will be outside.
When you have made your decisi髇, call me.
June, you've got to do this for me.
If you can divert their attention, we may get a chance to escape.
We could get help and come back for you.
You mean you'd actually leave me here?
But, darling, Garvay and l can be back tomorrow, now that he knows the exact location.
I see what you mean.
Malla?
I'm ready.
Come, choose a man for the sacrifice.
You have your choice.
Any man I wish?
Any man.
Then I choose him.
June.
You have made an excellent choice.
You will have beauty and revenge at the same time.
Mrs. Talbot, now that Malla has given you the precious gift of youth,
I think it only fitting you show your appreciation and give her your beautiful gold necklace.
Don't you remember?
The expensive gold necklace you asked me to keep safely for you?
Oh, yes, I remember.
Malla, would you accept this gift from me?
Since vanity has no regard for time,
I will wear your necklace.
Garvay knows exactly where it is.
May he bring it here?
Malla.
Malla?
Mmm-hmm.
Malla.
Is it true?
Here. Look.
I'm young.
I'm young again.
Yes, and you're going to stay young.
We're getting out of here.
Come with me.
Get out there.
Your youth will not last long.
Do not waste it.
This night is yours.
The coming day brings you death.
Enjoy it well, both of you.
June.
Come on. Quiet.
Come sit down.
We're safe as long as we stay away from the river's edge.
Do you know where we're going? Mmm-hmm.
Yes, I do.
The river runs north all the way to Lake Victoria.
That's where the railroad is.
It will take us quite a while to get there.
Look at them.
And Malla said it wouldn't last.
You know, David, sometimes I can't sleep at night, thinking of the way I was.
I'd rather die than go back to that.
There won't be any going back.
I took care of that.
Young lady, you're in the company of a man who's going to be very rich once we get back.
I have here the elixir of sudden wealth and beauty.
You got away with them.
Wasn't that the whole purpose of the expedition?
David?
David! You've got to help me.
June!
June, no!
I need help.
June, take your hands off me.
Help me!
June, don't touch me.
Give me the Nipe.
Don't touch me.
I want the Nipe!
June, get...
Give me the Nipe!
Get away from me!
David! Don't leave me!
David!
David, please don't leave me!
David!
David, don't leave me!
I can't get out!
Help me out!
I'm sinking, June!
Give me the leather pouch.
Help me out first!
I'll give you the leather pouch!
You give me the leather pouch first.
June!
Help me! June, come on, quick.
I can't get out! Hurry up!
What're you waiting for?
June, what's the matter? June!
All right!
All right, here. Grab on.
Pull, June!
Pull more!
Little more! Little more!
That must be June's plane now.
What an awful thing to go through.
She was crazy about the doctor and he treated her just terribly.
Maybe he had the right idea.
It sure worked for him.
Well, don't you try anything like that if you wanna stay in one piece.
Do you see her?
No.
That's funny.
Her wire said flight 16.
Maybe she missed the plane.
Are you Neil Foster?
Yes.
I beg your pardon, but have we met?
No.
How do you know my name?
Mrs. Talbot described you in detail.
I'm her niece,
Terry Hart.
Well, how do you do?
Your aunt never mentioned you.
Is she with you?
No, June came down with the flu.
But she...
She asked me to come ahead and open up the house and get things ready.
Oh, you'll...
You'll be staying with her?
Yes, now that she's alone.
Oh, would you mind getting my luggage for me?
Then we can go.
Of course. Glad to.
I'm Sally Howard.
I used to work for your uncle.
Yes, I know.
Then your aunt described me to you, too.
Yes, she did.
Then she told you that Neil and I are engaged.
No, she didn't mention it.
Why should she?
Oh, I don't know.
Just thought I'd mention it.
That's everything.
Oh!
Thank you.
I hope you'll be comfortable.
Thank you.
If you need anything, why, just call me at the office.
All right.
Goodbye, Miss Hart.
Goodbye.
Neil?
Yes?
Do you know where my aunt keeps the liquor?
The liquor?
Mmm-hmm.
Yes.
She keeps it under the bar.
What'll you have?
Well, you're the bartender.
How about a little vodka over ice?
That's fine.
Only there isn't any ice.
Next time you come, there will be.
To your new home.
Cheers.
I better go.
Thanks.
Just one more thing.
Yes?
Would you mind taking my bags upstairs?
No, glad to.
Which room?
Put them in my aunt's room for now. I...
I don't know what room I'll be using.
All right.
It's a little stuffy in here.
It's been...
It's been closed up for so long.
There. That's better.
She's getting impatient. I...
I'd better go.
Sally is outside, waiting.
She has years to wait.
My time is much shorter.
What?
I can't explain that.
You think I'm attractive?
You know you are.
And perhaps a little aggressive?
I don't know you well enough to answer that.
Would you like to?
Uh-huh.
Get out of here.
What?
Get out! Go!
Terry! Listen!
Terry! Terry, what's wrong?
Terry!
Just go.
Terry, are you all right?
Yes, I'm all right.
Just go.
I don't think an explanation will help. Do you wanna try?
No, l... I don't.
I had a drink with Terry and took her bags upstairs.
Look, her aunt's an important client and a good friend.
I... I couldn't just run out.
Now, don't start imagining things.
Yes?
Mrs. Talbot?
Yes, of course.
June.
Why didn't you call me?
I could've met you at the airport.
I didn't want to bother you.
I... I can't tell you how sorry I was to hear about Paul.
Let's not talk about that.
It's been a nightmare.
Please sit down.
Now what can I do for you?
I want to hear all about your trip...
Shocking, isn't it, what three months of tragedy can do to a woman?
June, I'm...
I'm sorry.
Well, I didn't come here for sympathy.
I need money until Paul's insurance can be settled.
Why, of course. Will $500 be enough for the time being?
$5,000 would be better.
Miss Gregg, will you make out a check for Mrs. Paul Talbot for $5,000? Thank you.
Now, may I please have my jewelry?
Certainly.
It's right here.
June, if there's anything I can do for you, please don't hesitate to call.
Thank you. I appreciate that.
Oh, l... I almost forgot.
Thank you for being so kind to my niece.
She'd... She'd like to see you again, if you have time.
I had a different impressi髇.
I know. She told me of her awful behavior to you.
She'd like you to excuse her.
She's... She's gone away somewhere to brood.
When will she be back?
Tonight, I hope.
If not, she may never return.
I don't understand.
If I see Terry, would you like me to tell her to call you here?
Yes, no matter what time it is.
I... Well, I want to know if she's safe.
Thank you for being so concerned.
I know she'll appreciate it.
Oh, I'll pick up the check on my way out.
Oops!
Lady, I'm sorry.
Let me pick it up, lady.
I just wanna find out if I can bend over without falling down.
You're carrying quite a wad, lady.
It ain't safe in this part of town.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
Are those real rocks, lady?
Mmm-hmm.
May I buy you a drink?
No, thanks.
I'm on the wagon.
You like music, honey?
Mmm-hmm.
Real hot music?
Isn't this a beautiful view?
Yeah.
Just like Tiffany's.
You dig young guys, honey?
I like young men very much.
Sure you do.
Where do you come from, honey?
Does that matter?
I'm here now.
Yeah.
Got any relatives?
No, I'm all alone.
Nobody to worry about you or miss you, huh?
No. That's why I appreciate your company so much.
That's nice.
You married?
I was once. He's dead now.
That's too bad.
Yes.
He was like you in so many ways.
How's that, honey?
He was so understanding of older women.
So considerate.
I'm very understanding of you, honey.
Especially in all this beautiful jewelry that you're wearing.
Sally! What are you doing here?
Well, it would be more to the point if I asked you, considering we had a date two hours ago.
I... I'm sorry.
I... I forgot.
Is that all you have to say?
Well, l... I got to working on some briefs, you know.
Oh, yes, you've been working.
Very interesting work.
All right, l... I won't lie to you,
I was waiting for a phone call.
From Terry?
Sally!
Sally!
Hello?
Terry. Your aunt had me worried.
Are you all right?
Sure, I'll be there as soon as I can.
In about an hour.
All right.
Goodbye.
Come in.
The door's unlocked.
All set for a lovely evening, aren't you?
Champagne, soft music...
Very nice.
You don't miss a trick.
I try not to.
Now, why don't you be a good little girl and go on home?
You wouldn't want Neil to find you here like this, would you?
That's for sure, but you missed the most important thing.
I wouldn't want Neil to find you.
So you're coming with me.
I'm putting you on the next plane to New York.
Don't be ridiculous.
Now, why don't you get out of here and leave me...
This is a most persuasive little instrument, and if you don't want me to use it, you'd better hurry.
You don't mind if I take my purse along, do you?
And I'll need a coat.
It's in the hall closet.
Get it.
You're being awfully foolish, you know.
Even if I did go, I could always come back.
By that time, Neil and I'll be on our honeymoon.
You know, you can get in an awful lot of trouble this way,
Iittle giris that play with guns.
I... I told Sally how I feel about you.
She didn't take it very well.
Everybody can't win.
I'm just lucky that you want me.
I'm the lucky one.
Just thinking about you is exciting.
If this is love,
I never loved Sally.
Terry, will you marry me?
No, Neil, I can't.
Why not?
There are reasons.
What reasons?
Don't you love me?
Well, it's because I love you
I can't marry you.
Now, let's not get so serious.
Let's enjoy each other while we can.
There's no time like the present, you know.
I'll get it.
Yes? What is it?
Police.
Mrs. Paul Talbot in?
No, she isn't. She's spending the night with friends.
What's the trouble?
Mind if I look around?
Now, just a minute.
This is a private residence.
Unless you have a search warrant.
This do?
Neil, make them go away.
I'm afraid he has the right to be here.
This is a search warrant.
Officer, I'm
Mrs. Talbot's attorney.
If she's in any trouble,
I have a right to know about it.
Did I say anything about trouble?
If I knew what Mrs. Talbot is accused of, maybe I could... Maybe I could help.
She isn't accused of anything.
We just want her for questioning about a murder.
Murder?
That's impossible.
Just doesn't figure.
Woman who owns a house like this getting mixed up with a guy like Jerry Lando.
Who's he?
Small-time con man.
He was found murdered in his car earlier tonight.
He was seen in the presence of an elderly lady.
There are witnesses.
Witnesses that could identify Mrs. Talbot?
No need to. Lando had her calling card in his pocket.
This address.
Mrs. Paul Talbot.
This is unbelievable.
Well, maybe...
Maybe he kidnapped her.
Well, we won't know till we find her.
Lando probably planned to rob her.
That was his specialty.
She got the drop on him.
He was killed with a peculiar sharp instrument.
My aunt couldn't do a terrible thing like that.
Your aunt?
Funny.
There was a murder exactly like this one a week ago.
Then it couldn't have been Mrs. Talbot.
A week ago she was in New York.
So was the murder.
Joe, I guess we'd better exercise that search warrant.
See if there's anybody upstairs.
Right.
The witnesses said your aunt was wearing a large diamond necklace tonight.
Oh, well, that proves it.
Mrs. Talbot's diamonds are right here.
Neil.
All that proves is that your aunt's been here since the murder.
All right, where is she?
Well, l...
I don't know.
Anyone upstairs, Joe?
Nobody up there.
I won't let you search this house in my aunt's absence.
Sorry, miss.
Get away. Get away. No!
No, don't open that door! Don't! Don't...
No.
She tried to kill me!
I had to kill them!
It was my only chance to stay young!
We really did find the secret of...
Rejuvenation.
I'll show you. I'll show you.
I'll become beautiful again.
I'll show you.
Come on, open up!
It's not working.
I killed Sally for nothing.
Hit it!
Destroy All Monsters
United Nations Science Committee
Space Port II
The 10th century is nearing its end.
The UNSC has established an exploration base on the moon.
Rockets depart for it every day from this base on Iwo Jima.
Moonlight SY-3 ready for takeoff.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero!
The UNSC has also constructed a giant undersea farm in the vicinity of the Bonin Islands.
All manner of fish are cultivated here, and on the surface is Monsterland, a research habitat of fearful giant monsters.
Godzilla is there.
Along with Rodan.
Anguirus is also present.
Mothra and Gorosaurus live in peace here as well.
If they attempt to leave, it activates a restraint system.
In other words, a variety of scientific walls tailored to their instincts and traits contains them.
The reason Rodan can't fly beyond a set boundary at sea is that a perimeter of magnetic barriers has been set up.
Moreover, enough food is cultivated here for the monsters that they can each eat their fill.
Monsterland and the undersea farm are controlled automatically from a control center built deep underground.
Yes, CHX should work fine.
Everything is in order.
Don't the monsters look rather cute from above?
Yes, very.
That's a relief. I feared you'd run away, this being your first encounter.
Oh no.
I hope you'll help us as we closely study them.
Yes, sir.
Long-distance call for Kyoko Manabe.
Please go to box 4.
Hi.
Oh, Katsuo!
Where are you now?
The moon base.
This is an expensive call.
Yeah.
I was worried when I heard.
But I'm doing fine, as you can see.
I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about how you'll treat Godzilla.
Oh.
As it turns out, a monster lives on the moon too.
Really?
Just joking.
We're not sure what it is, but we're concerned. I'd like Dr. Yoshida to come.
The director is in
Tokyo for a conference.
Then once he's back...
Hello? Hello?
What's wrong?
Hello!
Hello!
Power station! Power station!
This is the operator.
Power station, what's wrong?
We have no idea.
Look, every control system is down.
Inconceivable.
Perform a thorough systems check.
How's the incident-analysis circuit?
It's not running!
What happened?
I don't know.
Doctor!
It's gas!
Come on, this way!
Having suddenly lost contact with Monsterland, the UNSC in Tokyo immediately launches an investigation headed by Dr. Yoshida, using communication satellites.
Number 006 is now showing the Bonin Islands.
Zoom in.
Yes, sir.
We can't. We're still being jammed.
Try again. Don't give up.
This is deliberate sabotage.
Deliberate sabotage?
But who? And why?
Doctor, we got through.
That's Monsterland, but I hardly recognize it.
Did new volcanic activity cause this? l doubt it. Zoom in more.
Yes, sir.
What's happening?
What is that?
This was definitely a planned attack. l doubt any of our staff survived.
This is the Moscow broadcasting office.
This is an emergency broadcast.
Rodan has attacked Moscow.
Rodan?
At 11:25 AM today.
It appeared above the city and is even now continuing its rampage of destruction.
This must of course be the same Rodan from Monsterland on the Bonin Islands.
Rodan is in Moscow?
What's going on here?
This report is coming to you from Paris.
A subterranean monster has just appeared from the Arc de Triomphe.
The pride of Paris...
No, the world's treasure is about to be destroyed by this monster.
The monument is collapsing. lt's been destroyed. Paris is being destroyed by this subterranean monster.
The world's major cities are being destroyed one by one by giant monsters.
Rodan is in Moscow,
Mothra is in Beijing,
Manda is in London, and Baragon is in Paris.
We've just received a new report.
Godzilla has appeared in New York.
Godzilla is in New York.
How do you explain this, Doctor?
How did the monsters escape?
Weren't they all contained before this?
Gentlemen, we regret that people suspect we are concealing information about these monster attacks.
What about you, Dr. Yoshida?
All I can currently do is give a warning, as if this were a natural disaster.
The monsters will keep rampaging, so everyone must remaim fully alert.
Silence please! What I mean is
I'm as ignorant as you right now.
I have the same questions you do.
I have no answers right now.
One question, Doctor. Why hasn't Tokyo been attacked when it's closest to Monsterland?
I'd very much like to know why myself.
If anyone can tell me, please speak up.
Moonlight SY-3.
Moonlight SY-3!
This is Moonlight SY-3, over.
Return to base.
Has something happened?
You'll see. Hurry back.
Hey!
Follow that!
Yes, sir.
It won't get away today.
But we need to get back.
This is more important.
That's a UFO out there.
It's dangerous to get any closer.
What is that?
Moonlight SY-3!
Moonlight SY-3, what's wrong?
Damn it. Go.
This seems completely backwards.
I don't know what's happened on Earth, but it's absurd to ask us for help.
They didn't ask.
What then?
It's a recall order.
We'll guide you once you enter the atmosphere.
You'll land at Monsterland on the Bonin lslands.
Proceed directly underground.
Only you and your ship can do this job.
And all of you should be armed.
Armed?
Yes. Be very carefuI.
Understood.
Trajectory good.
Receiving guidance beam.
Roger that.
Stand by for atmospheric entry!
Reverse thrusters, check.
Entering atmosphere!
This is Moonlight SY-3. We've just arrived at the control-center entrance.
Good. Someome may have commandeered it.
Ascertain their identity and objective.
Be careful. They may resist.
Roger.
No sign of radioactivity or sulfur dioxide.
All right, let's go.
Look sharp.
Yes, sir.
Look!
Systems are up.
What's going on here?
Welcome.
Kyoko! Doctor!
Hello again.
Why are you here?
I didn't expect you to come.
What's all this about, Doctor?
Let's relax and talk this over.
We want you, our young scientists and engineers, to understand and cooperate.
Cooperate?
Cooperate nothing. You let all the monsters free while Director Yoshida was away.
They're not running free.
We have them under remote control.
Remote control?
Take a look.
Mothra is currently near Beijing.
Godzilla is in the Pacific.
Rodan is over the Urals.
We can call them back to this island anytime we want.
I'll introduce you to the inventor of this remote-control system.
Follow us.
Welcome, gentlemen.
I imagine you have lots of questions.
I am not your enemy.
With your help, I want to establish a new scientific civilization on this planet.
How does destroying our cities establish anything?
You should listen to everything she has to say, Katsuo.
Kyoko!
We will establish our new civilization.
Some degree of sacrifice is unavoidable.
What?
Where are you from?
Kilaak.
Kilaak?
It's not on Earth.
There are countless asteroids between Mars and Jupiter.
She's from one of them.
You believe that story?
Belief doesn't matter. I admire her scientific knowledge and creativity.
It should be obvious from the monster remote-control system.
Her science is far superior to ours.
Okada, stand down!
Now do you see?
That barrier is completely unbreakable.
What are you doing?
Getting you out of here.
Where's everyone else?
They're all well, and happy to keep working.
Call them.
Don't you see? 
It's no use resisting.
All right, fine. We'll just take you two with us for now.
We'll carry you out if we have to.
Now walk!
Gas! Hurry!
Stop right there!
What are you doing?
Get off me!
Hurry!
It's closing!
Hurry it up!
Move!
Captain!
C'mon.
Hurry up!
We have masks!
Don't let her escape!
Take him to the ship!
Yes, sir!
Kyoko! Kyoko!
Captain! Captain!
Fall back!
Fall back!
Captain! Captain!
Captain!
Okay, let's move!
Was it brainwashing?
Is that what they did to you?
You're not giving us any answers to our questions.
Listen, Otani.
The only way we can help is if you answer.
Don't you get that?
"I don't know" isn't good enough.
Major cities are still being destroyed!
We sent in some UN troops, but the island was already deserted.
Where's their new base?
Please, tell me.
We can't continue to hide you from the UN's secret police.
Our friendship won't make any difference to them.
What shall we do?
Doctor!
Hands off.
It's you!
Are you Kilaak underlings now?
You'll understand soon enough.
We've come to get you.
You too.
There's no point in moving him now!
Stay still.
We should handcuff him.
It's the secret police.
Retreat.
We need to go!
Halt!
Scalpel.
Was he hard of hearing?
No.
Then it isn't a hearing aid.
It's some kind of metal I've never seen.
There must be some kind of radio receiver inside it.
But why was there a receiver implanted in his body?
Doctor. Isn't this how they're controlling the monsters?
I agree. Dr. Otani was being controlled the same way.
Yes. They came to get him for fear we'd find this.
There must be a transmitter somewhere.
If we can detect the signal, we can jam it.
Contact the commumications lab.
I'll search from the air.
This signal's fishy.
Figure out where it's coming from!
Yes, sir.
It's coming from Japan's central mountain region.
Look, I'm busy.
However rare this is,
I don't have time to look into it.
Yeah, but still...
Officer!
Something's flying up there.
Over there.
Where?
There!
It's that!
What is that?
R-Rodan!
No, it's not. Let me see.
Over there!
That's the moon rocket SY-3.
SY-3?
We went to the moon with Takeshi that time.
That's right.
Is he doing well?
Yeah.
Can I help you?
We're investigating a signal.
Go right ahead.
Excuse us.
What's that?
It's a radar.
Please observe this object, which appears to be a stone.
The UNSC has confirmed it as the Kilaak monster-control device wreaking havoc upon our world.
What's more, they're being discovered in the most unexpected places.
The cliffs of Dover.
The steeple of a church in Spain.
One appeared to be a clump of ice in a ravine in the Alps.
One was even discovered in a coconut on Guam.
Dr. Yoshida will now explain its capabilities.
This is a transceiver with an incredibly complex computer built in.
We estimate its effective broadcast range to be about 2,000 km.
So the monsters are likely being controlled by devices in their respective areas.
Regarding the Kilaaks and their prisoners from Monsterland...
They've likely returned to their countries to carry out their plans.
We ask for everyone to assist us so we can find them quickly.
Former Monsterland technicians
Mimoru Kudo, age 35.
Tetsuo Ise, age 30.
Shin Kuroiwa, age 28.
Kyoko Manabe, age 23.
All Japanese citizens.
Technician Michael Dawson, age 32, British citizen.
Elmer Hughes, age 19.
Thank you, miss.
You can go.
We beg your pardon.
Thanks, you can go.
Excuse us.
Thanks, you can go.
Please take shelter!
Rodan is circling over areas VII and VIII.
It's finally come to this.
The evacuation seems smooth.
It does.
New target sighted.
Godzilla has appeared in area I.
What?
Manda!
Manda has appeared.
Prepare to attack.
Prepare to attack.
All right.
Open fire.
I didn't expect Tokyo alone to stay safe, but Rodan, Godzilla, and Manda all at once?
Indeed.
New York, London, Moscow... It's been one monster for each city till now.
Emergency update, emergency update.
Mothra has appeared in area V.
Integrated Defense Headquarters
Liaison Conference Center
We really got hit hard.
Tokyo is in ruins.
There were four monsters. But the Kilaaks are more interested in the Izu peninsula.
Izu?
We've lost contact with merely every hot spring in Izu.
Just like what happened at Monsterland.
Do we have proof the Kilaaks are behind it?
There's a subterranean monster at Amagi.
Baragon?
Do you know why every major city except
Tokyo was attacked in the first place?
They were diverting our attention from
Japan while they set up a base under Izu.
No wonder. They must be using a new control device now.
Yes, and we must locate exactly where they are.
I want you to perform a focused underground survey with your SY-3.
Then find a breach we can launch a subterranean attack through.
Good to see you again.
Thank you, Doctor. Good to see you.
It's Kyoko Manabe.
Why are you here?
Let's talk elsewhere.
No, I want to talk to all of you here.
I know what you have to say. Don't tell me again!
Even if you don't want to hear it, the others will.
Especially the reporters.
Where did you come from?
From the Izubase.
What base is that?
A base the Kilaaks established as a foothold on Earth.
You're here as their messenger?
Yes. lf you recognize their residency rights and negotiate toward coexistence and coprosperity, they will return all the monsters to the Bonin Islands.
Amd if we don't, they'll destroy us with the monsters.
That's coercion, not negotiation!
I'm talking to everyone here. You be quiet.
Come here.
What are you doing?
Calm dowm!
You're being manipulated!
Stop fighting me!
Doctor!
She was being controlled with these.
They controlled the Monsterland employees and monsters, and killed Dr. Otani with this.
Doctor.
This is another new type.
We'll investigate them immediately.
Kyoko! Kyoko, wake up!
Kyoko!
Good, you're awake. It's me.
We'll get you patched up in no time.
It's all right.
Miss Manabe, this is urgent.
We need you to tell us about the Kilaaks and where you've been.
Kilaaks?
That's right.
In which part of Izu is their base?
I...
I...
Yellow poison gas!
She has no memory of when she was being controlled.
All right then.
Now entering target zone I!
Ground troops are in position!
Okay.
Prepare to attack.
Here we go, men!
Yes, sir!
SY-3 has begun its decent!
Good.
Godzilla's in our landing zone!
Halt descent!
Emergency ascent!
Emergency ascent!
Emergency ascent!
All right.
Open fire!
Hey, what's wrong?
We're being jammed!
It's Anguirus!
What?
Damn...
Operations halt! Operations halt!
Damn it.
Back to base.
What a shame.
They outwitted us again.
Hey.
Do we follow?
Yeah.
It's descending near Mt. Fuji.
Looks like it's tied to the Kilaaks.
Determine where it's landing.
Yes, sir.
Rodan's behind us,
15 degrees to our left!
Captain, running away sucks. Let's fight back.
It's not time yet.
It won't follow us where there's no air.
Prepare to leave atmosphere!
Preparing to leave atmosphere!
Main engine, full throttle!
What an escort Rodan makes.
Now we've lost our target.
No, we have a rough idea.
I'm sure they'll find the Kilaak access point if they search all over Mt. Fuji's western side.
Advance!
Keep advancing!
Third platoon, keep advancing!
Godzilla!
S-Spread out! Spread out!
Fan out!
First platoon, take the left forest road!
Second platoon, to the right!
Third platoon, follow second platoon!
This way!
What's wrong? Get up!
You okay?
I'm all right.
Let's go.
Must go pretty deep.
Let's go in.
Damn it...
It won't budge.
I bet it's a Kilaak cave.
Our only choice is to move forward.
All right.
Okay, get back. I'll shoot it.
It's no use.
It's good to see you again, Mr. Yamabe.
Welcome, Major Tada of Defense Command.
We summoned you here today on important business.
Summoned?
I knew it.
They're here, all right.
That's them!
Yes, that was our spaceship you saw on the moon.
Do you believe now that we're aliens?
So what's the important business?
A proclamation.
Proclamation?
Please listen carefully,
Major Tada in particular.
Earth doesn't belong to humans alone.
The area beneath the Mt. Fuji volcanic chain now belongs to the Kilaaks.
Invaders will be driven back by force of arms. Understand?
What?
Damn it.
Let's go.
Yeah.
Meanwhile, at Monsterland on the Bonin
Islands, the control center was running again.
The staff was hard at work analyzing the monster-control devices that had been gathered from around the world.
So it is the moon.
That's the true source of the signal!
We'll send SY-3 to the moon.
Don't land!
And don't take off those spacesuits till you deal with the Kilaaks.
Proceed to the target.
Understood.
Take a look at your chart.
Yes, sir.
I'll indicate your destination.
41 degrees north, 4 degrees west.
The Cassini crater, south of the Vallis Alpes.
Watch out for UFOs and approach from a low altitude.
We'll be on our way then.
Our approach vector is 45 degrees to port.
From the Sea of Tranquility to the Sea of Vapors.
Down the western side of Montes Apenninus, then north from palus Putredinus.
That'll bring us to the Casaini crater.
Roger.
There's a UFO 45 degrees to our starboard aft.
We've been detected?
It'd be surprising if we weren't.
What do we do?
We either do this or turn around.
Either way, circumstances won't get any better than this.
Okay, let's do it. In an hour's time we'll either be successful or dead!
One minute to target!
Full stop.
Full stop!
Prepare to descend.
All right, here we go. Descend!
Descending!
Full stop!
Full stop!
Prepare the rover!
Preparing the rover!
Close the fuel valves!
Fuel valves closed!
Activate cooling system!
Activating cooling system!
Temperature still climbing!
Hurry!
Coolant pressure?
At max!
What? Max?
Yes, sir!
What's wrong?
It's no use. At this rate, the fuel tank will explode!
Should we launch?
No time. We'll attack from the rover!
Yes, sir!
Halt!
Halting!
Prepare to fire maser cannon!
Masercannon, ready to fire!
Fire!
Commander.
SY-3 is in combat on the moon.
We detected a flare at Cassini.
All right, get in touch with the moon. I hope this works.
We still don't know if it worked or not!
I'll report as soon as they come back alive.
This is the moon base, over.
Ignore it!
Yes, sir...
If they fail, we'll be the next to die.
We might get vaporized along with this base before long.
Let's just relax amd have some coffee.
Yes, sir.
Let's get out.
Yes, sir!
Okada, Yoshikawa, Arima, come with me. Fujita and Tani, stand by.
Come on.
Arima and Yoshikawa, inspect the equipment.
Dismount and disable anything important.
Understood, sir.
I didn't expect the maser to be this effective against them.
Even the most advanced science will have some weak point.
Hey.
Over there too!
It's the Kilaaks.
They can nearly survive in high temperatures.
When we destroyed the wall, the temperature dropped.
Are they dead?
I'm not sure.
Captain! Captain!
Gather them up.
Yes, sir.
This is the control device's core.
Damn thing's still running.
Let's dismount it.
We'll take it back to Earth.
Yes, sir.
Moon base. Moon base!
No answer?
None at aIl.
The base won't answer, and the signal's still there.
Did they fail?
Do you think they failed?.
Damn.
It's not working.
Time for the final option.
Let's detach the excavator!
Yes, sir.
What's going on?
Detach the maser.
Right.
Get a high-voltage cable!
Okay. Open it.
Yes, sir.
Screwdriver.
Okay.
Let's go!
Hurry!
Given how long it's been since that irregularity was observed on the moon,
I think our only choice is to assume they failed.
Okay, switch it on!
What's wrong?
The circuit caught on fire!
I don't care! Turn it on and up!
We can't go back if we do!
Don't think about that! 
Turn it on!
Yes, sir!
It worked!
The KiIaak signal vanished. Hurry!
It's our turn to control the monsters.
Yes, sir.
Hurry! You can bet the Kilaaks on Earth noticed this!
Is it still alive?
Yes, it is.
But it needs a temperature in the thousands to become active again.
Is it living metaI?
Yes.
Now we know why they were after the Mt. Fuji volcanic chain.
Their scientific prowess far surpasses ours, but they're very few in number.
It probably takes thousands of years to grow to this state.
Thousands of years?
Don't they have a life span?
No. At constant high temperatures, they can probably live forever.
Forever?
That's right.
But at low ones, they quickly become like this.
Now we know how to attack them.
Heavy use of freeze rays.
Major Tada, draw up a plan.
Yes,sir.
Godzilla!
Again?
Doc!
You're there?
Yes.
Excellent. You've done well.
Doctor, this is no time for that!
Godzilla just showed up!
What? Are you serious?
Godzilla has appeared in Tokyo?
Yes.
You don't say. Our control device is complete, so we thought we'd test it on Godzilla.
So he's back in Japan.
Then, Doctor...
The monsters are on our side.
They'll obey humam commamds.
We'll mobilize them all in the Mt. Fuji region ao they can trample the Kilaak base!
There isn't a cloud today over Mt. Fuji.
It and the primeval Aokigahara forest are silent, as if awaiting the impending full-scale giant-monster attack against the Kilaak base.
The defense forces are already in position.
There are still no monsters to be seen.
Will the first to arrive be
Godzilla? Rodan? Anguirus?
We still don't see them.
We still... Oh, there's one!
It's GodziIIa, far off in the lower right, beyond the Yoshida Asama Shrine forest.
No, it's Minilla.
Minilla is the first to appear.
Following him, we have the king of monsters, Godzilla.
Now Mothra has appeared.
Mothra is approaching from the same direction as Godzilla.
Next to appear is Anguirus. It's Anguirus from the Asagiri Plateau on the left.
Truly a sight to see.
Following Anguirus are Manda,
Baragon, and Gorosaurus.
Kumonga's here too.
One after another, they're bearing down on the Kilaak base here in Aokigahara.
Rodan is too. Flying over Lake Motsu with the Southern Alps in the horizon.
Rodan's now over Lake Kawaguchi.
He's landing near Godzilla and Mothra.
Will Godzilla lead the opening charge?
He seems to be deciding where to attack.
The Kilaaks underground have still shown no reaction.
This force of giant monsters with Godzilla at its head is truly a sight to behold.
UFO approaching.
What?
It's King Ghidorah.
He's no Earth monster.
The Kilaaks summoned him.
We can't control him. 
What do we do?
We'll make Godzilla and the Earth monsters fight together.
King Ghidorah is a monster from space.
Earth's monsters are mo match for him.
Contact me whenever you're ready to talk.
Damn it.
It's King Ghidorah, the space monster.
He's taking aim at the Earth monsters from the air.
The monsters are ready.
King Ghidorah is swooping down savagely!
This is an amazing struggle!
Hear for yourselves the cries of these dreadful monsters!
A burning monster is fIying south toward Izu.
A burning monster?
I've never heard of such a thing!
Space creature or not, it can live while on fire?
It's heading straight for us!
Evacuate!
The Kilaaks are signaling us!
Fire Dragon destroyed
Dr. Yoshida's control system.
Won't further conflict simply result in more losses on your part?
What now? Do we attack?
Fire Dragon can reduce Tokyo to ashes in two to three hours.
Is that Godzilla?
It is. He's found the Kilaaks' underground stronghold.
The monsters are on the offensive.
They're still fighting, even without the control system.
They know by instinct who the true enemy is.
The KiIaaks didn't manage to see that coming!
Get away from here. G!
Thank goodness.
It's to soon to celebrate. Fire Dragon's coming back from the Bonin Islands.
We'll ambush him with the SY-3!
Katsuo!
Fire Dragon,
15 degrees ahead to port!
Prepare to fire freeze-ray missiles!
Fire!
We can't! The tracking system isn't working!
It's being jammed.
All right, use manual aim.
Yes, sir!
Let him fly past and stay on him!
Yes, sir!
Ready to fire!
Firing!
We've got to shake him!
Look!
A Kilaak flying saucer...
I get it!
Fire Dragon was just a machine!
We aren't being jammed amymore. Do we fire?
Yeah.
Fire!
We've done it!
Captain!
The End
It´s a wonder...
... Wonder Woman...
You´re so wild and wonderful
´Cause it seems whenever...
...we´re together...
...the planets all stand still.
Barbarella´s psychedelia...
...there´s a kind of cockle shell about you.
Barbarella... Bar...Barbarella.
You dazzle me with rainbow colors...
Fade away the duller shade of living...
Get me up high...
Teach me to fly...
Electrify...
A night with starry light...
...above the stratosphere.
Bring your dearness near
Till the dawn comes tumbling down
Don´t make a sound.
Every word we need comes from the sky.
Can´t you read my mind
Say in love
Don´t you give me a cold shoulder
Still I´m dying, girl, to hold you
And make love....
...love...
Barbarella´s psychedelia...
...never can a fella name or clone you...
Barbarella Bar...Barbarella
Stand by for a message from Dianthus...
...President of Earth and
Rotating Premier of the Sun System.
- Barbarella?
- Mr. President.
- Love!
- Love!
Just a minute.
I´ll slip something on.
Don´t trouble yourseIf.
This is an affair of state.
What I must say not only is grave...
It´s a secret.
A secret?
Have you ever heard of a young scientist named Duran Duran?
-Yes.
- Recently en route to the North Star...
...he vanished into the uncharted regions of Tau Ceti.
But... why is that a secret?
Because Duran Duran is the inventor of the Positronic Ray.
- It´s a weapon.
- Weapon?
Why would anyone want to invent a weapon?
How should I know?
The universe has been pacified for centuries, sir.
As far as we know. Yet we know nothing of Tau Ceti or its inhabitants.
Could they still be in a primitive state of neurotic irresponsibility?.
Precisely. And If they learn from this young scientist...
...the secret of the Positronic Ray...
...they will be able to shatter the loving union of the universe.
- That might mean archaic insecurity...
- And war.
- You mean seIfish competition and...
- I mean war.
- Bloody conflict among entire tribes.
- I don´t believe it.
Neither do I.
But we can´t take a chance.
- Something must be done.
- Yes. You´re the girl who must do it.
- Why me?
- I have no armies or police.
I can´t spare the presidential band.
Plus, you´re a 5-star Astro-Navigatrix.
Your mission then:
Find Duran Duran...
...and use your incomparable talents to preserve the security of the stars...
...and our own mother planet.
How do you read me?
- Straight.
- Here´s the one known photo of Duran.
Age 26. Hazel eyes.
A rather handsome fellow.
I don´t think I´ll be able to recognize him, sir.
Now, this is a portable brainwave detector.
Attention...
Set your atom transmitter at 0-3-5.
- Positive.
- Object in transit.
Object received.
In order to test for Duran Duran´s presence, simply press this contact.
- Light will glow. The alarm will sound.
- It has a built-in tongue box.
Here is something you may need.
- It´s a weapon?
- For seIf-preservation.
We borrowed it from the Museum of Conflict.
That´s my good girl.
One day, Barbarella...
...we must meet in the flesh.
Thank you. And... love!
Love!
Armed... Like a naked savage.
Alpha 7 to Base... Alpha 7 to Base.
We leave the Zone of Solar Attraction in 7 minutes. Acknowledge.
Base to Alpha 7. Acknowledge.
Prepare for acceleration into temporal space.
Acceleration into temporal space...
Continuum now beginning.
Alphy, when do we get to the Tau Ceti gravitational field?
154 hours, seven minutes, elapses Earth Time.
Right.
- Wake me up in 154 hours.
- Confirmed.
- Good night, Alphy.
- Confirmed.
De-acceleration looks in line...
Barbarella rise and shine.
Prepare to insert nourishment.
End of course in temporal acceleration in 7 seconds.
Alphy... It´s Tau Ceti.
- What´s happening?
- Magnetic disturbances.
Magnetic disturbances?
Emergency systems!
All emergency systems will now operate.
- Our magnetic screens are dead!
- Force of magnetic hurricane is 1 1.9.
Gyro compass is not, repeat, not functioning.
- You mean you can´t navigate?
- That is correct.
I´ll switch it to manual.
What are our chances?
Our present possibilities of non-destruction...
...are 0.00002 to 10,000.
My number 2 stabilizer has been damaged.
- Where am I?
- That´s what I  ws going to ask you.
Planet 16 in the system Tau Ceti.
Air density 0.051.
Cool weather with the possibility of stormy precipitations.
Analysis of the atmosphere: terrestial with a mild excess of oxygen.
I count 600324 molecules per cubic millimeter.
Well, at least I´ll be able to breathe.
What marvelous little girls! Hi!
Do you speak English?
Parlez-vous francais?
Wait, let me adjust my tongue box.
Must be a Galactic 5 dialect.
But I haven´t skied in ages!
But that´s Duran Duran´s spaceship!
Hi!
Listen, children, this game is amusing, but it´s gone too far.
I don´t want to hurt you. I want to know some things about this spaceship.
Come on, untie me or I´ll call your parents.
That´s very sweet, but I...
No!
Help!
Help!
Stop!
Hello!
Thank you!
No!
I can´t understand.
Parlez-vous francais?
Better adjust my tongue box.
Are you all right?
I think so... Who are you?
I am Mark Hand, the catchman.
And who are you?
I´m from the Planet Earth. Tell me what you know of this spaceship.
I know nothing. It was here when I accepted the job of the catchman.
- Catchman?
- Yes. Children live on icey Weir...
...until they have reached a serviceable age.
- Serviceable?
- Then I capture them just as you saw.
- I turn them over to the authorities.
- I see.
Thank you.
Ever heard the name Duran Duran?
I know nothing. I live alone on icey
Weir. Such is a catchman´s life.
Only in Sogo will you find the answer to your question.
- Sogo? Is it near?.
- It´s just beyond that ice-deck.
Did I see your spacecraft at the far edge of this lake?
Yes, but I´m afraid it´s broken down.
- Magnetic storms ruined my stabilizer.
- Perhaps, I can help.
I´m quite experienced mechanically.
I service and maintain this icecraft.
- If you wish, I´ll take you to your ship.
- But there´s no wind.
Hold on.
- What a lovely cabin!
- Wind.
I´m so grateful for your help.
How can I ever thank you?
I´m sure my government would repay you.
If there´s anything I can do, please tell me.
You could let me make love to you.
- Make love?
- Yes.
You don´t even know my psycho-cardiogram.
On earth people don´t make love...
...unless their psycho-cardiograms are in perfect confluence.
You asked me what you could do for me. And I told you.
All right.
But I don´t see what good it will do.
- Do you have any pills?
- Pills?
- Never mind, I have some here.
- What is this pill?
An exaltation transference pill, of course.
- I know nothing of this.
- I see.
On earth when our psycho-cardiograms are in harmony for lovemaking...
...we take an exaltation transference pill.
And remain like this.
Here let me show you.
For one minute or until full rapport is achieved.
I don´t care for that.
This is what I mean...the bed!
That?
But nobody´s done that for centuries!
Except the poor who can´t afford the pill or psycho-cardiograms.
- Why not?
- It impedes maximum efficiency.
Also substitutes for ego support and seIf-esteem are now available.
- So, you won´t do it?
- If you insist, I guess so.
But there´s really no point at all in doing it like this.
- Without your garments, please.
- Oh.
Now I´ll have a look at your stabilizers.
Since your garment is torn, help yourseIf to my furs, Barbarella.
I think I´ve found the trouble.
You may proceed now to Sogo.
It´s there you will find Duran Duran Jr.
If he still lives...
Good.
Now, Barbarella, don´t you agree with me...
...that in some things, the old-fashioned ways are best?
What...? Oh, that.
Yes, I must admit it ws rather interesting.
Still, it is distracting.
- Are you coming with me to Sogo?
- No, I prefer the tranquility of Weir.
Sogo is too strict, the people too dedicated.
Perhaps you´ll stop here again... at the end of your mission.
Yes, perhaps I will...
Well, goodbye. And thanks again...
For everything.
It ws my pleasure.
- Please advise present situation.
- You wouldn´t understand.
- Stabilizer´s maIfunctioning.
- I´ve been repaired in reverse.
We´re going in.
I´ll activate the Terra screw.
Barbarella!
Barbarella!
Full operational power on all subterranean systems.
45 degree ascent.
Quarter-to-haIf for surfacing.
Got to get rid of this tail.
- I´m dead.
- No.
- Where am I?
- In the labyrinth of the City of Night.
- Are you an angel?
- I´m Pygar, the last ornithanthrope.
- How do you do?
- And you?
I´m from Planet Earth.
My name is Barbarella.
But you´re soft and wrm.
We´re told that earth beings are cold.
Not all of us...
My poor spaceship. Look at it.
I´m so sorry.
Pygar, what happened to your eyes? l fell during a magnetic storm and ws carried off to Sogo.
Sogo?
The City of Night ruled by the Great
Tyrant. There they blinded me. l ws left to die in the labyrinth until Professor Ping found me.
That´s terrible.
Can you really fly?.
No, l´ve lost the will to fly.
- How awful!
- lt no longer matters. lt´s the past.
- Have you heard of Duran Duran?
- Duran Duran?
Yes, Duran Duran.
He´s an astronaut from Earth. l do not know of such things.
- Perhaps Professor Ping can help.
- Professor Ping?
He´s very wise and knows all about Sogo.
- Where can I  find him?
- He´s with the others, eating.
- He´s there. Professor Ping?
- Professor Ping?
- Yes?
- My name is Barbarella.
Tell me. What is your origin?
You have the aspect of an earthling.
You are of female gender, right?
That is correct.
- Is that an orchid?
- Yes.
Orchids have very little food value and are hard to grow in this climate.
It amuses the Great Tyrant to resent the expense of feeding orchids to slaves.
- What kind of place is this?
- That is Sogo, the City of Night...
...ruled by the Great Tyrant and dedicated to evil in every form.
And this is the labyrinth.
All that is not evil is exiled to the labyrinth.
Look!
- Who is that gentleman?
- That is a Grand Grotesque.
That´s the classic way of ending life in the labyrinth.
Professor Ping, have you ever heard of Duran Duran?
Duran Duran from Earth?
Yes, indeed.
- He´s alive? Where?
- In Sogo, no doubt.
I must go there at once.
But as you´ve seen, no one may leave the labyrinth.
- I  have a spaceship, if only it worked.
- My child, perhaps I  can help you.
If only you could...
Let me take you there.
Pygar, will you show us the way?.
- What seems to be the trouble?
- I  think it´s the stabilizers.
Let´s have a look.
Pygar, pen...
Here... Thank you.
Thank heaven the hypodontical molecules are undamaged.
- Will it take long?
- Hours? Days? Weeks?
Who knows?
Genius is mysterious.
I can´t wit weeks.
Pygar?.
- You can fly me there.
- No, I  can´t.
Atrophy of the greater alea muscle.
The angel is aerodynamically sound.
It´s all a question of morale.
There´s nothing to do but wit.
Pygar, where do you live?
Come. I´ll tell you how to lead me.
- Just ahead.
- It´s a nest.
- Why, yes. That´s where I  live.
- lt´s marvelous.
I´m glad you like it.
Wait! They´re coming.
Help!
Pygar, right in front of you.
Pygar, no, to the right.
Now!
- What is it?
- One of Great Tyrant´s Black Guards.
- There isn´t anybody in there.
- No, Black Guards are leathermen.
They´re without fleshy substance.
Pygar, you saved my life.
Pygar?.
Pygar... Oh, Pygar!
Be careful!
Oh, Pygar!
Interesting therapy!
- I´ve regained the will to fly.
- I  know.
Oh, it ws...
It ws just heavenly.
- Can you take me to Sogo?
- But I  cannot see.
- I  will be your eyes, Pygar.
- I  do not believe it is possible.
We´ll be shot down by Black Guard patrols.
Not with my mini-missile projector, we won´t.
- Are you all right, Pygar?.
- Yes, thank you.
I don´t like the looks of that.
A little to the right.
Pygar, wtch out!
I got him!
To the right!
Up, Pygar, up...
We can hide behind that mountain.
Pygar!
Pygar!
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Just in time.
My energy box is completely dead.
Are we all right now?.
I think so. Excuse me.
We´re there! lt´s right below us.
We must land in a back street, for your sake.
To be seen in Sogo with an angel would be anathema.
Pygar, keep your head down.
Oh my, we must find something to hide your wings.
Wait, Barbarella!
- Don´t be afraid, Pygar.
- I  sense danger. Guard yourseIf.
There´s nothing.
I promise you. Come!
Barbarella!
Pygar, wit for me!
What do you want of me?
Oh!
Hello, pretty-pretty.
Hello.
Thank you very much.
Do you want to come and play with me?
For someone like you
I charge nothing.
You´re very pretty, pretty-pretty.
My name isn´t ´´Pretty-Pretty´.
It´s Barbarella.
- Have you seen an angel anywhere?
- The strange bird?
Yes.
What´s that screaming?
A good many dramatic situations begin with screaming.
Pygar!
Poor Pygar...
Pygar, back up.
There´s a room behind you.
They´re not following.
Pygar, come.
Tell me what that means.
´´Chamber of Ultimate...
...Solution´´.
I don´t like the sound of that.
We´d better get out of here.
Ye who have chosen to die, be welcome.
To terminate the bitterness of lIfe, you may select from three exciting...
...and surprising forms of death.
One of each awaits behind the doors you see before you.
If you fail to choose, you´ll be given to the Mathmos. There is no appeal.
Next solution.
Next solution.
We´d better take the chance.
Wait!
Thank you very much.
You must come with me.
What is your name?
What do you do in life?
I´m Concierge to the Great Tyrant.
- I  congratulate you on your timing.
- That wsn´t me.
- That ws ordained by the Great Tyrant.
- I  see.
What is that horrible thing under the floor?.
- That is the Mathmos, my child.
- The Mathmos?
You really are from Earth.
You don´t understand.
- No.
- The Mathmos...
The whole city is built over a lake.
A very curious lake. Composed like you and I  of living energy...
...but energy in liquid form.
And it wtches us.
It is magnetic. Being positively charged, it feeds on negative psychic vibrations.
What you would call ´´evil´´.
It thrives on evil thoughts, deeds and flesh.
In return, it gives us wrmth, light and life itseIf.
But it has a terrible appetite.
Perhaps you´ll see some other time.
Pygar! Pygar!
Don´t be concerned.
You´ll see him again soon.
Now, if you´ll just come this way.
Here, sit.
I´m afraid you must do as I  say.
There, sit.
Forward... Please.
- Oh, Moxys...
- What?
Look, Moxys. The earthling.
You get her. Get her now.
The Concierge will never let us. He always spoils our fun. Let´s try anyway.
- Play with us, earthling.
- You must play with us.
- We have lots of dolls.
- My God, what are they doing here?
Stomoxys and Glossina are nieces of the Great Tyrant.
They´re highly favored in our court.
- Why not with us?
- That´s not fair.
- The Great Tyrant goes first, children.
- We saw her first.
- Be good, girls.
- Stomoxys, Glossina... stay by me.
So, my pretty-pretty, we meet again.
You...! The little one-eyed wench.
You have a good memory,
Pretty-Pretty.
Sometimes I  like to go among my people... be like them.
Ordinary. Evil, as you call it.
So, I´m your little one-eyed wench.
I´m also the Great Tyrant.
- Well, that´s nice.
- lt amuses me immensely.
Now, you want some privileged information about a certain man, yes?
Yes, I´m here on the orders of the
President of the Republic of Earth.
- I´m here to find Duran Duran.
- I  don´t mean him, but the angel!
- Pygar?.
- Yes, Pygar.
He has escaped the labyrinth. Crime!
He´s destroyed 12 of my Black Guards.
Crime!
And he dares to deprive me of a pleasure unique in Sogo...
...An earthling. Crime! Crime!
- Where is Pygar?.
- You want your fine-feathered friend?
There he is.
Pygar!
Amusing, isn´t it, Pretty-Pretty?.
Don´t you feel like playing?
Pretty-Pretty...
You can play with us if you want.
- Yes, why not!
- Good, Pretty-Pretty.
The Mathmos is having its effect on you already.
It´s the fumes.
They make one want to play.
- Decrucify the angel!
- What?
Decrucify him or I´ll melt your face!
My face!
My beautiful face...
- Stop or I´ll shoot.
- Stop!
- My face!
- I  wrn you.
How dare you endanger my face!
Observe her power buckle,
Your Majesty.
Depleted. This weapon is as harmless as a child´s toy.
So, it ws a trick, ws it?
You should have saved your tricks for...
- For the birds, Your Majesty?.
- Yes, the birds.
The birds.
Give it to the birds.
You must...
Tell me, my fancy, fuzzy freak.
What do you think of when you make love to Barbarella?
Make love? I do not understand.
Don´t be coy with me.
You are in no position.
If only you had one eye, you would see what a delight I  am.
My face, my body.
All my things are a delight.
An exquisite delight.
- What is it you want?
- I shall share my delights with you.
You shall make love to me.
An angel doesn´t make love.
An angel is love.
Then you´re a dead duck.
Guards!
To the Mathmos with this winged fruitcake.
Come along... Get inside.
Oh, how darling. Oh, my...
Help!
Help!
This is really much too poetic a way to die.
- Password, quickly.
- I don´t understand.
- You´re a political prisoner?.
- I don´t think so.
- Are you not one of us?
- I´m from Earth.
Earth...? Planet of the Revolutions.
Will you join our cause?
What cause? Who are you?
I´m Dildano, head of the Revolutionary
Forces. This is our headquarters.
- Long live the Revolution!
- The Revolution!
Patrol report.
Second level immediately...
No, take the secret passage.
The door!
Are you typical of earth women?
I´m about average.
- How did I get out of the bird cage?
- Through a secret escape chute.
We´ve established secret escape chutes throughout the city.
It´s for the protection of our group.
- You realize you saved my life.
- A life without cause is without effect.
I´m sure my government would repay you.
Earthwoman, shall I  tell you what I  would like?
I think I know.
No! Not like that.
Like on earth... the pill.
- I have the pill!
- But...
Couldn´t we do it your way?.
I don´t want to change your traditions.
I´m not a savage.
- The pill.
- Right.
Five years l´ve wited for this experience.
Wait!
Long live the Revolution!
My group must...
Hello!
Sorry!
My group must have more...
Where did you get those pills?
Only Earth people know of those pills.
You there... What news?
My group must have more weapons before we can launch an attack.
- Back to position. Await your orders.
- Right.
- You will receive your orders!
- Long live the Revolution!
The door... the door... Door!
You must tell me! Did an earth person give you those pills?
- A man called Duran Duran?
- That´s correct.
- Where is he?
- He gave me the pills when he arrived.
Haven´t see him since. I  think he´s alive... probably in the castle.
- Do you have anything I  can...
- Of course, have a secret uniform.
Thank you.
I was sent here by my government to find Duran Duran.
Your government...?
That must mean that you have a spacecraft and weapons.
Yes, of course... I  don´t like this red.
Would you lend your equipment to our cause?
No, I couldn´t do that.
Not till l´ve completed my own mission.
- Perhaps we can strike a bargain.
- What do you mean?
Only the Black Queen knows the whereabouts of Duran Duran.
Her one vuInerable moment is when she´s in her secret Chamber of Dreams.
- Chamber of Dreams?
- Yes.
She sleeps alone in a room above the Mathmos...
... surrounded by a wll of energy, to which she has a secret key.
There is, however, a second key, which is now in my possession.
You want to find Duran Duran.
I want to capture the Black Queen.
You follow my meaning?
If you really have a second key, why haven´t you used it already?.
Because our forces are not yet strong enough.
To capture the Black Queen, we need to have a military coup.
We can do this with your weaponry and spacecraft.
Get control of the Black Queen and you´ll know where to find Duran Duran.
- Yes, I  see.
- Good.
I need six hours to ready my attack.
First, we need to reach Professor Ping to find out if Alpha 7 has been repaired.
Easily done.
I have a secret radio transmitter.
Professor Ping to Headquarters...
Professor Ping to Headquarters.
- Professor Ping to Headquar...
- No!
Headquarters to Professor Ping...
Headquarters to Professor Ping.
- Come in, please.
- This is Ping. I hear you loud and clear.
- I have the earthling...
- Barbarella.
...Barbarella with me. We can use her spacecraft and weaponry.
- Is her spacecraft in working order?.
- Yes, the craft is ready for flight now.
- Excellent!
- There is one danger, however.
A Black Guard patroller spotted the craft and may return to destroy it.
Good heavens!
I have programmed the craft to go a hidden location outside the labyrinth.
- You´re a wizard, Ping.
- It´s taking off even now.
There it goes. Perfect flight pattern.
Our rendez-vous point is 1600 hours.
Our password is...
´´Llanfairpwllgwayngyllgogerychwayrn- drobwllllantysiliogogogoch.´´
You mean the secret is...
´´Llanfairpwllgwayngyllgogerychwayrn- drobwllllantysiliogogogoch.´´
Exactly!
- Right?
- Right.
Headquarters signing off.
Headquarters signing off.
The time is right. The Queen is in her Chamber of Dreams.
- What about the key?.
- The key!
- There is the secret key.
- Where?
It´s invisible. Only an invisible key can open an invisible wll.
Where?
My Mathmos... the key!
The key...
I have it!
I´ll put it around your secret neck.
Invisible.
Now, the secret map that will lead you to the 12th corridor.
What corridor?.
Good!
This way!
´´Llanfairpwllgwayngyllgogerychwayrn- drobwllllantysiliogogogoch.´´
Long live the Revolution!
One moment.
I´m just not the tube type.
Excuse me. Could you tell me how to get to the 12th corridor?.
I have a taste for you.
- What is it?
- Essence of Man.
Essence of Man?
So, you escaped the birds!
Just as well.
It is my turn for some amusement.
Come with me.
This way, please!
- What is this thing?
- You will soon see, my dear.
´´Sonata for Executioner and Various Young Women´´.
It´s... sort of nice, isn´t it?
Yes. lt is nice... In the beginning.
Wait until the tune changes.
It may change your tune as well.
Goodness, what do you mean?
When we reach the crescendo, you will die... of pleasure.
Your end will be swift, but sweet... very sweet.
What is this? I don´t believe it.
It couldn´t be!
Wretched girl... What have you done to my excessive machine?
You´ve undone it.
You´ve undone me. Look, look!
Energy cables are shrinking.
You´ve turned them into faggots.
You´ve burned out the excessive machine. You´ve blown all its fuses.
My goodness!
You´ve exhausted its power.
It couldn´t keep up with you.
Incredible! What kind of girl are you?
Have you no shame?
Shame! Shame on you!
You´ll pay for this.
I´ve got something for you.
You´ll wish you had died of pleasure.
Now you shall learn the wisdom of the lash.
Haven´t you done enough to me?
I´ll do things to you that are beyond all known philosophies.
Wait until I  get my devices.
Duran Duran?
Oh, recognized me?
Recognized you?
I´d never have recognized you. I  thought you were only 25. What happened?
- The Mathmos is not without its effect.
- But you´ve aged 30 years!
The Mathmos has its own means of nourishment. In return, it teaches truth.
Dr. Duran, could you hand me a garment?
The President of the Republic of Earth sent me here to save you.
- And to return you to Earth.
- Earth planet? Never!
Shall I tell you why?.
Because I know too much.
Here in Sogo I have learned truth and essence.
I speak of the dignity, the nobility of pure Evil.
My boots, please.
Humanism! Morals! Principles...! lt´s rubbish! Nonsense!
I speak only of truth and of essence.
- Where is the Positronic Ray?.
- So, that´s it.
What does it do?
All persons and objects within its path are de-miniminized to the 4th level.
- You mean...?
- That´s right.
Replaced in the
4th dimension irretrievably.
- But that´s monstrous!
- Yes, it is. lsn´t it?
Why didn´t you take power here in Sogo?
The Black Queen must first be destroyed.
But as you know, she is always surrounded by her Black Guards.
Whoever succeeds in killing her will be put immediately to a horrible death.
Hence, my prudence.
I find horrible the idea that one could do to me that which I do to others.
But I was told the Black Queen is vuInerable while she sleeps.
Oh, yes. There are no Black Guards in the Chamber of Dreams.
That´s because there´s no access to the Chamber.
But, now´s time for my pleasure... and your death.
Wait!
I know how you can enter the Chamber of Dreams.
- How?. Speak!
- I  have the key.
- What does it look like?
- It´s invisible.
Take me to the Chamber of Dreams.
After you, Barbarella.
To the right, Barbarella....
Now, to the left...
Stop.
Open it!
- This must be the invisible wll.
- Yes. Now, where´s the key?.
- Come on, stop stalling.
- I´m trying to find the keyhole.
You´re trapped. You´re trapped in the Chamber of Dreams.
- The Mathmos will devour you.
- Your Majesty!
It´s no use. l´ve got the two keys.
The wll´s sealed for all eternity.
Dr. Duran, give up this madness!
- Return to Earth with me now.
- I´ll return to Earth, but as its conqueror!
Thanks to you, the Queen, my last obstacle, has been removed.
Thank you, Barbarella.
Nothing can stop me now.
Today, Master of Sogo...
Tomorrow, Master of the Earth, Master of the Galaxy, Master of the Universe!
Tell me, my fine, feathered friend, what do you think of...
...when you make love to Barbarella?
An angel doesn´t make love.
An angel is love.
Wake up, Your Majesty!
You must wke up.
Vade retro, Earthgirl!
I know you don´t really exist.
That may be, Your Majesty.
But we´d better stick to what we see.
Wretched girl, what have you done?
No one must enter while I sleep.
Your Concierge is taking over the throne.
- What are you saying?
- It´s true. He´s taken your key.
- We´re locked in, Your Majesty.
- The key. He´s stolen the key!
We are doomed... Doomed!
He said the Mathmos would devour us.
What did he mean?
It is said that unless I  am alone in my Chamber of Dreams...
...the Mathmos will claim me.
- It´s the throne room.
- I  can see all of the City and labyrinth.
Unfortunately, it´s a one-way screen.
No one can see that bloody dog has locked me in.
Your Majesty! We´re under attack.
The creatures in the labyrinth.
They´re revolting!
How dare he interrupt my coronation!
Dispatch the air armada!
Quick, Your Majesty, the labyrinth.
It´s Dildano. He will save us.
- Your Majesty, they´re all destroyed.
- Good.
- Not a creature left in the labyrinth.
- No aircraft left!
They have Earth weapons!
Fool! Liar! ldiots!
Must I do everything myseIf?
- I must destroy this rabble.
- He´ll use the Positronic Ray.
It works!
It works... It works.
All is lost.
I must die, very well, but it is I who shall have the last laugh.
The imbecile doesn´t know the secret of the Great Tyrant.
The supreme weapon.
I shall free the Mathmos.
- Do you think that´s wise?
- Sogo will disappear.
It will be the end. The Apocalypse!
- Where are we?
- In the Mathmos. And alive!
I can see that, but why?.
The Mathmos created this bubble to protect itseIf from your innocence.
That´s nice.
No, no, stop! I  command it.
I´m Duran Duran.
I´m Master of the Mathmos.
Fall back!
Fall back!
I´ll destroy you with my Positronic Ray.
You´re so good, you make the Mathmos vomit.
Pygar! What did you do to Pygar?.
He was sent to the Mathmos, but was no more digestible than you are.
You can´t be dead.
You win, Barbarella. But the earth has lost its last great dictator.
The genius of the Positronic Ray...
Why don´t you give him a mouth-to-mouth?
I have a better idea.
Please... Pygar, please.
Please wke up!
We must fly back to my spaceship.
Do you have the strength?
Pygar, why did you save her after all the terrible things she did to you?
An angel has no memory!
Are you able to see anything at all, Burt?
Nothing, captain.
Only a surface of clouds.
This planet seems to be made of fog.
Not even infrared rays get through.
Well, keep trying.
I've got the laser on infrared, it may penetrate.
There, the strange signals are continuing.
Now the localization is sharper.
15 degrees, felcar coaxial alfa vacuum..
Right.
This is our sixth orbit around this planet, and that signal always comes from the same point.
If a man-made transmitter does exist, that's the spot, all right.
MARK: 2 more meteors.
Yes, sir. I'll check on the total.
Eldon, Tiona, Kell, we just rejected 2 more meteors.
What's our total now?
999, Wess.
1 more and I'll bake you a little birthday cake
with 1,000 candles.
Without this rejector,
we'd look like a piece of Swiss cheese.
Our ship would be down in less than a minute.
Let's prepare for a landing, Brad.
Okay.
Attention. Attention, all crew members, prepare for landing.
In 60 fractions of megon, we'll start the landing maneuver.
The intensity of the gravitational field
will be maintained
at the wave moment of force G 7.
Synchronize the meteor rejector
on the electro-magnetic control device.
Apply neuro-vascular tension.
Suppress cortical areas X, Y, Z.
Insert the automatic controls.
We will keep a distance of 2 parsecs
from our sister ship Galliot.
Respond when command received.
Command received.
Sanya, get me the captain of the other ship.
Spaceship Argos calling spaceship Galliot.
Spaceship Galliot, we're receiving.
Captain Salas is wanted on the ionoscope, please.
All right, mark, he's standing by.
You were right, mark.
It's not cosmic radiation.
It's a reality,
a reality that we'll see at first hand.
Glad to hear you admit it,
Salas. It's never too late.
We were never as crazy as you seemed to think.
You certainly had us worried, though.
Oh, you've put a spy on board? Huh, huh.
Anyway, you'll have to agree it was just luck.
You can't chase after all the sounds in the universe.
All right, so it's not a cosmic cloud.
But what about life?
Who can say yet that there's any life on aura?
Who can assure us that it's not a natural source of emission?
We'll find out soon enough.
Right now, get ready to land.
Synchronize on gravitational wave moment of force G 7.
Shall I put us on the automatic control?
Yes. When you're
2 parsecs from us.
1 minute.
Mark, wait.
Your younger brother is here
and he has something else to tell you.
Mark, I want to warn you.
This will be the first and only trip...
We've lost it.
Sanya, the reserve channel.
Zinex impulse, quickly.
Hello. Hello, Galliot.
Hello, Galliot?
Hello! Contact's been broken, mark.
The zinex impulse channel, throw it on.
The signal's been interrupted, mark.
The planet stopped transmitting.
SANYA: Galliot.
Sanya, what about the Galliot?
SANYA: Galliot, hello!
I'm not getting anything, mark.
The zinex impulse channel, try it again.
Hello, hello. Hello!
There's nothing, mark.
The radio communications are blocked.
Try it again,
Sanya.
Hello.
Hello, Galliot!
MARK: The automatic alarm.
MARK:
Emergency! Emergency!
The gravitational force is increasing rapidly.
Wess, where are we at?
Give me a reading.
20, mark. 20 G.
Seal bulkheads. Got to activate them now.
Brad, the automatic control, disengage it.
I'm switching to manual.
What happened? Why did she attack you? Is she crazy?
What happened?
Don't you remember?
Wess!
BURT:
Mark. Try to get hold of him.
Mark!
Are you out of your minds?
What's wrong with everyone?
Where are you going? Mark!
MARK: Tiona.
Tiona!
WESS: Stop!
DR. Karan! Stop!
Carter. Carter!
Mark, what was
I trying to do?
Mark...
WESS:
In here, Mark!
Mark, now Karan's gone crazy.
I was just coming to when he attacked Brad.
I rushed him, but he escaped through there.
Burt, you stay here.
Wess, come with me.
He's activated the security lock.
There's nothing we can do.
They open only when the sensors touch the ground.
The helmets! We'd better get the helmets.
What happened? How did
I get out of the ship?
What are you looking at me like that for?
We don't know what happened, Karan.
Only some of us have been behaving strangely with no memory of it afterward.
Do you feel all right now?
I guess so.
You're sure?
Yes, yes,
I'm sure.
All right, go inside.
Some of the men seem to be hurt, doctor.
I want you to take a look at them.
He doesn't remember anything either.
What's happened?
What's going on?
I wish I knew.
MARK:
I can't see anything.
Not a sign of the Galliot.
Yet we don't seem to be damaged at all.
Come on, let's get in the ship.
I can't see a scratch on the radar guidance arms.
Let's check the underside.
There's no damage.
It's as if we made a practice landing at the space academy.
Come on let's get in.
All right, all right.
Quiet down. Quiet down.
Stay calm.
Let's all try to stay calm and figure out what happened.
Now, the automatic controls went completely haywire.
Maybe we can find out why after Wess has had a chance to check over his recordings.
Without warning, the force of gravity increased like mad.
And it went up to 40 G.
A force which only a planet with a mass 1,000 times superior to ours could've put out.
That's not all.
While you were all unconscious and I was expecting the ship to crash head-on, the force suddenly stopped and we set down gently.
And then...
You all went crazy.
BRAD:
And if you hadn't held out,
I hate to think of what would've happened.
Yes, it is pretty puzzling.
What do you think, professor Karan?
I don't know. I don't know what to think.
I've always known that any force greater than 25 G's kills every living thing in a few seconds.
Urgent. Urgent.
Emergency!
Be quiet.
Emergency!
Conditions desperate.
Little chance of survival. Help us.
We can't hold out much longer.
Repeat.
Conditions desperate.
Sounds like capt. Salas.
They must be in trouble.
Sanya, keep trying.
Burt, take a look on the infra-ray, see if you can spot anything.
They must be fairly close.
Urgent. Urgent.
Help us.
Hello. Hello. Argos calling Galliot.
Argos calling
Galliot.
We're receiving you.
Continue on this frequency.
We'll try to get a fix on you.
What is your position?
Argos calling Galliot.
Argos calling Galliot!
Mark, look!
What have you got?
The Galliot.
MARK: The red's cut through.
Can't tell how far it is.
Get me a fix on this right now.
We'll do a low-altitude takeoff and search.
They can't be too far away.
Wess, Brad, control.
All our solar batteries have been short-circuited.
Any visible reason?
Another mystery?
Wess, what can we do about it?
I checked the temperature.
Second lavic stage.
I'm not interested in the temperature.
Can we get across it or not?
Well, it's pretty dangerous down there.
The rocks appear to be fused and they're solid enough.
If they continue across the marsh, and if we're lucky...
Let's try it.
Clear.
It's obvious.
They fought.
They fought and killed each other off.
Just as we were about to do.
None of this... this madness that has touched some of us, none of this is coincidence.
This was planned.
By whom?
By what?
And what about the others?
We can look for them.
Poor Toby, on his first trip...
The chamber's locked from the inside.
We'll need a torch to break through.
I counted 4, what about the others?
They don't seem to be inside.
Let's take a look around.
WESS: There isn't anybody in the upper chambers.
MARK: And what about the control room?
It's empty.
Look in the dome's secondary corridors.
All right.
In the meantime, we'll look in the sections of the automatic circuits.
Now, in case of any emergency, we meet in the atomic generator room.
MARK:
Find anything?
WESS: No. The energy section is deserted.
Let's continue.
The 3 that are missing can't disappear into thin air.
Shh.
Listen.
It's coming from the generator room.
Turrell.
And Salas, mark?
The meteor rejector is out of commission.
It can't be repaired, either.
The Galliot won't fly again.
Neither will her crew.
What about this bulkhead?
We've got to get through.
I'll take care of it, mark.
I'll get the cutting torch from the Argos.
No, you'd never make it alone.
No. We'll bury Derek and the others and then we'll leave you on guard, Eldon.
We'll go for the cutting torch and I promise you, we'll get back just as fast as we can.
Sanya, I know how you feel, but don't go to pieces now.
Just be thankful we were spared.
Come on. We've got to keep moving.
We'll get back as fast as we can, Eldon.
Keep a sharp watch.
MALE VOICE:
Eldon...
Eldon...
Eldon...
Eldon...
MARK: Eldon?
Eldon, where are you?
Eldon, where are you?
Eldon?
Eldon!
Maybe he's inside the ship.
Tiona, you stay here.
If anything moves, shoot first, ask questions later.
MARK: It's weird.
There's no one here.
WESS: But we left
4 bodies here.
How could they have disappeared?
Eldon?
Eldon!
Kir! Salas!
Where are they?
They're gone.
All of them.
Eldon, too. I left him on guard.
Listen, mark, maybe you imagined it.
Maybe the bodies really weren't in here, you just thought you saw them. Hallucination.
I don't suffer from hallucinations, Karan.
I saw the bodies.
Maybe our senses react in a strange way on this planet.
I saw the bodies.
I saw my brother, dead.
What happened to Eldon, then?
He wasn't a ghost, a hallucination.
Let's take it easy.
There must be some logical explanation.
KARAN:
That's right, Mark.
Mark.
What is it, Wess?
We weren't dreaming.
Those bodies really existed.
Look, blood!
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
What happened?
Tiona, what did you see? Tell us.
Come on, let's get out of here. Hurry!
There seems to be several things completely unexplainable.
For 2 years, we heard the electronic signals coming from this planet.
Now that we're here, nothing.
Yes, but we did hear voices.
A strange tongue, but voices.
There were intelligent beings here.
You could've fooled me.
I never felt so all alone.
Maybe we're not alone.
Somebody or something could be watching us here, right now.
If there are any intelligent creatures on this planet, they're our enemies.
Wess, you've been taking sightings and adding figures, what does it come out to?
How long can we stay here?
3 days, mark.
Another 3 days before this planet's orbit will have swept us so far away, we may not get back home at all.
What do you think?
Can you boost the solar batteries by then?
I'm trying to hook up some other way of starting us.
What are our chances?
We have 3 chances in 10 to make it, or be blown to smithereens.
All right, Wess, tomorrow morning, you get to work.
Take whoever you need to help you.
Right now, I think we should all get some sleep.
I think we need it.
A captain should not be afraid.
And I confess now, to whoever may hear this, that today, now,
I am experiencing fear.
I must not let my crew know this,
I must keep them busy.
I must not let them know that the situation appears more hopeless with each passing day.
Dictated by capt. Mark markary, of the spaceship Argos on the planet aura...
Wess!
Wess!
More trouble?
He was trying to disconnect the meteor rejector.
Disconnect the meteor rejector?
I don't understand.
I assure you, I don't understand it either.
Wess, you knew what you were doing.
Yes, I knew.
I was fully aware, all the time.
What?
I couldn't help myself.
I fought it with all my power.
But, it was no use.
I had to disconnect the meteor rejector.
But why,
Wess, why?
I don't know!
It was like...
Like another will fighting my own, in my mind.
Trying to take over control.
Dr. Karan, have you got any thoughts on this?
The only conclusion
I can make is that each one of us is his own worst enemy.
But how?
Why?
I'm afraid
I know.
Whatever unseen beings are out there, they apparently have the power to influence our minds when we're unconscious.
They tried it during the landing and just now when we were sleeping.
If what you say is true, Karan, we mustn't give them any more chances.
From now on, we'll put a guard on anyone who's sleeping.
Who's there?
Burt!
Burt!
What's up?
I... I don't know. I thought
I heard something.
Did you see anything?
I don't know what I saw.
I don't even know if
I saw anything at all.
Mark said to sing out if we saw anything not in the book.
If we saw any thing at all.
I'm going to report.
Emergency. Guard post 3.
Emergency.
Wess, you come with me.
The rest of you, be careful.
What is it?
I thought I saw something.
What?
Out there.
Well, like luminous globes.
I saw them out of the corner of my eye.
But when I looked, they were gone.
Where's Burt?
He's gone back to post number 2.
Keep your eyes open, but don't get carried away.
Who's out there?
Hold it!
Burt, what happened?
Tell me, who did it?
It was... Captain, captain Salas.
What's out there, mark?
What's happening?
That's what we have to find out before they kill us all.
Come on, let's get him into the ship. Give me a hand.
1 entire crew lost and 2 of our own crewmen gone.
Burt dead,
Eldon disappeared.
And this unknown enemy keeps getting closer.
KARAN: The enemy is also becoming visible.
What do you mean by that?
Well, you saw something.
Something not quite identifiable, out of the corner of your eye.
As if it were composed of little globes of light, something fleeting, nothing definite.
The minute I looked at the things directly, they were gone.
SANYA: How can you explain it?
MARK:
I don't know.
It's possible they're an alien form of life.
DR. KARAN: That's true. Their form here could be based on a different plane of vibrations.
Flesh-and-blood men can't see them, except obliquely, as you did, mark.
WESS: Those strange wails we heard could be their voices.
That's right.
Well, we'll bury
Burt tomorrow.
Another tomb we have to leave on this dangerous planet.
Sanya?
I'll be right with you, mark.
First, I want to remove
Burt's nameplate.
Sanya.
Sanya, come on.
They need you.
Oh, I still have
Burt's nameplate.
Give it to me.
I'll finish the records.
You've done enough today.
Thank you.
Aah!
Rest well, Burt.
I'm sorry we weren't around to help you.
I promise we'll try to see that you didn't die in vain.
All right, let's not stand around, we've got work to do.
Feeling better,
Tiona?
Better, mark.
I swear it, mark.
I didn't imagine it.
Wess?
I think we'll make it, mark.
I'm beginning to get energy traces across the inductors.
How much longer?
We might be ready by tonight.
Good. We're making a little tour of inspection.
Carter says he saw something in the valley, something shining.
Let's go take a look.
CARTER: Mark!
Come here.
Look down there.
That's what
I saw shining.
MARK:
Finally, something tangible.
That doesn't disappear when I look straight at it.
SANYA: Looks like it's been here for a long time.
Look how pitted and scarred the hull is.
MARK: Doesn't look like any ship I've ever seen.
SANYA: Do you think it belongs to the Aureans?
CARTER: I doubt they ever built any spaceships.
If they had, we would've...
Look, Mark.
MARK: It's 3 times the size of us, and judging by the deterioration of the calcium, it must've been here a long time.
Probably belonged to an ancient civilization.
Carter, you stay here.
Keep your eyes and ears open.
Right.
Sanya and I will take a look around inside this thing.
Oh, uh, if he moves, just call out.
Right.
(HIGH-PITCHED BUZZING,
SANYA GASPS)
Sanya, what is it?
Oh, I...
I got a shock.
How?
Touching that.
Ouch!
That must be over 200 volts.
I wonder what they used it for.
Possibly it's an electric torch. They...
Held it in their hands and it became luminous.
Beings as big as they seem to have been could have held it without feeling any kind of shock.
Carter.
Carter!
Carter!
Carter!
Car... Ter!
Mark, look what I found.
What is it?
Looks like a tuning fork.
Why didn't we think of that before?
Of what?
The locking device could be a Sonic one, a lock designed to open only to a certain sound, to a certain frequency only.
Mark, it's strange in here. I can't breathe.
Something's drawing the air out through this vent.
We've got to find a way to get out of here.
If only we could find the secret of that lock.
Ooh!
Quick, get out!
Carter!
Carter, where are you?
Maybe he's gone back to the Argos for help.
Yes, you could be right. Come on.
Let's go.
Let's get back.
Carter?
Yes.
No, mark. He's not with us.
He was with you, wasn't he?
Has he disappeared as well?
I'll tell you what happened later.
Mark?
Tiona, she's in shock.
What happened?
She was standing guard and all of a sudden
I heard her scream.
When I reached her, she could only point and whisper,
"Danny, Toby."
There was nothing, mark.
Absolutely nothing.
She simply broke down.
We'd better talk to her.
I saw them, aah.
I saw them, aah...
I saw them.
I looked right at them.
Who did you see,
Tiona? Who?
They were there, in the fog.
All mutilated and bloody.
Who, Tiona, who?
Tell me.
I looked right at them.
They didn't go away.
They were humans, not ghosts.
Who, Tiona, who? Tell me, who did you see, Tiona?
Empty faces.
Dead faces.
Post number 1.
Post number 1.
Reply to call.
Post number 2, post number 2.
Post number 2.
Call received. All ok.
Here's post number 3.
Post number 3.
Post number 3.
Everything fine here too.
I'm passing back to number 1.
Machinery room.
Machinery room.
This is post number 1. Wess?
I'm anxious to know how you're doing.
Standing guard here makes one
even more impatient for the blast-off.
Is there much more to do
before the batteries will be ready? Well?
I understand.
You're worried.
But I don't think it'll be too much longer.
We're practically there, mark.
Another 8 circuits to go and then...
And then we either take off or we...
Or we blow up.
Right now, I'd welcome either one.
Post number 3 alarm!
Who's there?
Who's out there?
No! Don't fire.
Salas.
Kir.
Yes, mark.
It's us.
It's us.
We're so exhausted it's hard to concentrate.
We remember descending for a landing with all conditions perfect.
Then nothing.
Until we found ourselves fighting our way out of unconsciousness somewhere out there.
Well?
That's about it, mark.
Go on.
We walked around some, looking for the Galliot.
But we didn't find her.
It was a miracle that you found us.
All right. I'm glad you made it. I sure can use you.
Now, go and get some sleep.
Thanks, mark.
I forgot. If one of you sleeps, the other must stand guard.
That's an order.
I'll explain it later.
Very well, mark.
What do you make of it?
I don't know what to think, mark.
Shock? Temporary or partial amnesia?
By now, nothing should surprise us.
Anyway, you can't argue with the fact that they're here.
And very much alive.
Or so it seems.
TIONA:
Mark.
You said "seems", mark.
How many strange things seem and then are ever since we got on this planet?
I really saw them, the 3 we buried yesterday.
I know they're dead.
And I saw another one, mark.
Who, Tiona?
Burt.
Burt?
Even though we buried him yesterday.
I saw him, mark. I saw him.
I saw him, mark!
If only I could be certain of what you're saying.
There's a way to be certain.
You see?
It's intact.
TIONA:
Open it. Mark.
Ah!
Wess!
Dr. Karan!
Salas and Kir are not in their bunks.
Have you seen them?
No.
Have you?
Salas!
Salas!
Salas!
No, it's not Salas.
Just his body.
I inhabit the body of your late captain.
And I'm just one of many beings on this planet.
Many beings who are desperate.
We've been in trouble many years now, and we're fighting to survive.
We arranged for several of you to kill each other so that we could take over your bodies.
You are our last chance.
It's imperative that our race continue to exist.
At our expense?
If you were in our place, you would understand.
On your planet,
I know you humans have fought and killed for centuries.
Do you really expect us to be any different?
We cannot be wiped out.
We'll stop at nothing.
We must fight, no matter how.
We are a race that exists on a vibratory plane different from yours.
Our limitations are entirely different.
Our technology, we cannot build anything, spaceships like this.
We need ships to get away.
Perhaps our survival is possible somewhere else.
Our sun's been dying, as you can see.
And that means the end of our species as well.
We have been attempting to summon you here for centuries.
Just as our sun had no more energy, you heard our message.
We never expected you to actually respond.
You mean, it was nothing but a lure.
You wanted us here.
That's why you sent that message.
Have you tried this trick before?
Yes.
The strange ship from another system.
And I suppose you need our dead bodies?
No. They must be willing only to submit.
Lose their bodies as well as lose their will.
We'll never submit to a breed of parasites.
Our relationship would be symbiotic.
In effect, we would be 1 body.
It would in no sense be parasitical.
You've got no choice.
Either all of us go back together or none of you, nobody will go back.
You will never get there.
You'll see. We will get there, mark.
A certain rejector, vital to you, has been taken away.
You can't leave without it.
We'll return it to you, only if you agree to take us back with you.
All right, you've heard all of the facts.
And you'll cooperate.
No, never.
We'll give up our lives to save our own race.
Quick, the generator room!
Wess, you have the red key to the atomic detonators.
Here's the green one.
I want 3 pounds of plutonium.
What are you going to do, mark?
The Galliot's going to be blown up with its entire cargo of living dead.
But first, I've got to get back the meteor rejector.
Wess, how long will it take you to get ready?
I have to finish the photonic ignition.
The rest is all set.
Good. I want you to stay here.
You 2 come with me.
Wess, as soon as we're out, close the doors and the bulkheads, but keep the screens turned on.
As soon as you see us coming back, turn on the ignition.
We'll worry about replacing the rejector after we're out in space.
That's taking a terrible risk.
Yes. I wish it were the only risk we'd have to run before taking off.
But there's no other solution.
Go on, get the detonators.
Tiona, you stay here.
Cover our retreat.
Don't move for any reason.
And remember, the danger is not only in front of you.
15 seconds after the Galliot explodes, if we haven't come back, you run to the Argos and take off, understand?
Mark, I can't let... that's an order, Karan.
Let's go.
There's nobody here.
Now, I want you 2 to stay right here.
No, mark. You won't go alone.
Listen, Brad, I'm not trying to be a hero.
We each have
1 charge.
If I don't make it, it'll be your turn.
If he fails, you try it next.
You stay here,
Brad. Cover us.
My brother.
He's turned into 1 of them.
Take the count.
Ready? Now.
Go ahead.
Quick, in the generator room.
Sanya, give me the countdown.
TOBY:
All right, you can stop now. throw away your gun.
Leave the meteor rejector.
You'd better get used to the idea, mark.
You've reached the end.
You have lost.
Toby, if you have anything left in you of what you were, let me go on.
Fortunately, there's nothing of what I was left.
Only the body's the same and now...
No use, mark. You can't harm me with violence.
Sorry, Toby, but this is the only way I can prevent you from stopping me.
Ah!
Time's running out. Hurry.
Ah!
Ah!
There they are.
They're being followed.
We'd better help them.
Karan, Brad, Tiona:
Dead.
Dead?
I'd better replace the meteor rejector right away.
Sanya, you take the controls until we come back.
It's sad, mark.
Out of 18 people, there are only 3 of us left.
I'm ashamed to be alive.
They died to save our planet.
Can you imagine?
Our world invaded by those horrible creatures?
Just thinking about it, seems a nightmare.
Mark.
Yes, it is sad, Wess.
But it was only luck that brought us here.
Wess, you need some sleep.
You haven't slept for 2 nights.
Yes.
Sanya and I will keep watch.
I need some sleep.
Who's there?
Mark, is it you?
Sanya?
If I wasn't so wide awake,
I'd swear I was dreaming.
What happened, Wess?
I was about to fall asleep, when I heard footsteps out in the passageway.
They approached my cabin.
Then what happened?
Then, the door opened, slowly.
As if someone were debating whether or not to come in.
And did they?
No, Sanya.
Then you didn't see anything.
Yes, I did.
He was holding his field ray gun.
He was mirrored on the metal wall.
Are you sure you saw him?
I know you won't believe me, Sanya.
I certainly wish I was wrong, myself.
But it was really him. Mark!
It was mark, Sanya.
Why did he come to me so...
Furtively?
Maybe he wanted to kill me.
Well, then what are your conclusions, Wess?
Unfortunately, there's only 1 conclusion.
Even mark is controlled by one of them.
Oh, it's impossible.
Let's go see.
Wess?
Wait a minute.
Mark.
Wess has found out about us.
Don't be afraid, Wess.
Nobody wants to harm you.
Nobody wants to kill you.
You...
You're one of them.
And you too, Sanya.
It's horrible.
You.
Both of you.
You must become one of us.
All you have to do is want it.
Just let one of us join you.
It'll give you this wonderful new complexity.
No. No!
Our world will never fall into your hands!
Maybe not, but you won't be the one to stop us.
Yes, I will!
Ah!
Sanya, without the meteor rejector, we'll never be able to reach home.
What do we do?
We'll have to land now, on that planet.
I've done an analysis with a special probe.
We can exist in the atmosphere.
It's the third planet of the star we call sol.
It's so small, it's not even marked on the astro-navigation charts.
But will it be possible to live there, for us and those who follow us?
It's most likely a young, primitive world.
But I think it'll be all right for us.
SANYA: I'll activate the long-range telescopic lens.
Yes, I was right.
It is a puny civilization.
Their buildings are still made of stone and iron.
How will they accept us?
I hope, well.
For them.

- Mornin'. Taxi?
- That's right.
- American?
- How d'you figure it out?
Your clothes don't fit proper!
- Maybe you can recommend a tailor.
- Too much responsibility.
Tailoring's personal.
You here on holiday?
Sorte. I'm going to the Witley place.
You're not.
- Something wrong?
- Nothing wrong.
- Can you tell me how to get there?
- No. Sorry, mate.
- I wonder if you could help me.
- Possibly.
I'm anxious to get to the Witley place.
Sorry. I can't help you.
Can you help me?
Excuse me. This man following me.
He's asking for the Witley place.
Here he comes.
Hello. Is there any place around here where I can rent an automobile?
No. Bicycle, maybe.
Where are you going?
- The Witley place.
- You're wasting your time.
- How d'you figure that?
- The Witley place!
He wants to go to the Witley place!
Anything wrong with wanting to go there?
- Is there anything wrong with that?
- Well, is there?
- Bicycle shop's down the street.
- "ls there?" he asks!
- Hello.
- Something you want?
I'd like to rent a bicycle for a few days.
Where would you be riding it?
I'll pay for it in advance.
- I asked where you'd be going.
- To the Witley place.
- I'd need a bicycle, wouldn't l?
- Yes.
And more than that.
You'll not be using one of mine.
Why? You've got loads.
I don't see anybody waiting.
- No bicycles for rent.
- What about the motor?
I've nothing for rent.
What will it cost to get to the Witley place?
More than anything you have to offer.
Why? What's the matter with everybody in this town?
Nothing's the matter. Here.
Just what's that supposed to mean?
It means the only way you can get to the Witley house from here is on your own two feet.
Hello?
Hello?
How do you do? There was no answer so I took the liberty of entering.
The signs clearly say to keep out.
You must have seen them.
Oh, yes. I saw them.
By what right have you entered this house?
- I've come to visit the Witleys.
- Oh? I am Nahum Witley.
Well, sir, actually it's Susan
I came to visit.
Susan? My daughter's not receiving visitors.
I must ask you to leave.
- This the way you treat your guests?
- Guests? Guests are invited.
- I don't remember inviting you.
- Oh, I have been invited.
By Mrs Witley.
"Stephen Reinhart".
You are Stephen Reinhart?
Uh, yeah. That's right.
My daughter did mention your name.
She met you in America at university?
- We were in the same science class.
- Science!
It would disturb Mrs Witley to see you.
Again, I must ask you to leave.
- It isn't her I've come to see.
- Quite impossible.
I will have Merwyn take you to the village.
Steve!
Susan will ask you to stay.
But for reasons I cannot go into,
I must insist you tell her that you have to leave at once. Merwyn!
Get the car.
Steve!
Susan!
- You look great!
- I thought you'd never get here.
- It's only been a month.
- Is that all?
- Father, this is Stephen Reinhart.
- I know.
- I must speak to you alone, Susan.
- I'll take him to meet Mother.
It's forbidden for your mother to have visitors.
Only for a minute.
Mother's been waiting to meet Steve.
I had no idea you lived in a house so, uh... sumptuous.
This is my great-grandfather, Elias Witley.
He built this house over 150 years ago.
This next one?
It's my grandfather, Corbin Witley.
Oh? What did he do?
He went insane.
We must get rid of him, Merwyn.
He must not stay.
Steve, you must understand about Mother. She's not well.
Mother?
Come in and close the door.
Mother, this is Stephen Reinhart.
We have been expecting you.
I'm, uh... I'm sorry you're not feeling well, Mrs Witley.
It will pass.
You are a welcome guest in this house, Mr Reinhart.
- Thank you.
- My husband will protest.
- But I shall speak to him. Susan?
- Yes?
I would like to speak to Stephen alone.
Yes, Mother.
Please, sit down.
I am glad that you have come at this time.
Merwyn!
Merwyn, are you all right?
Yes, sir.
I'm going to need your help.
You can trust me, sir.
- About what, Mrs Witley?
- Come here.
Closer.
That box, Mr Reinhart, there.
Open it.
- It's an earring.
- Yes.
It's an earring.
Take it out of the box. Examine it.
- Looks like gold.
- Yes. It's gold.
But its importance doesn't lie in the metal it is made of.
- I'm afraid I don't understand.
- Why should you?
You probably think this whole house is obsessed with mystery.
I tell you, that single earring you are holding is surrounded by mystery.
It... It belonged to my maid, Helga.
She was a nice simple girl and completely devoted to me.
Well, about a month ago, she went down with some terrible disease.
I begged her to go to the doctor in Arkham.
- Did she go?
- No.
No, I don't think she did.
Chains for devils!
Whatever it was, she seemed to be overcome by... by something, well... Well, it almost seemed like self-loathing.
She took to wearing a veil as if to hide herself from prying eyes.
Why, um...
Why is the earring so important?
About a fortnight ago, she came here to see me.
She was crying.
She said she was... she was frightened of what was happening to her.
- What was happening to her?
- I don't know.
I'm not sure.
Anyway, she left, and she dropped that earring.
Stephen, I haven't seen her since.
Well, perhaps Mr Witley knows.
My husband says he knows nothing.
Stephen, it's because of all these things that I had to be sure of you.
You are my one hope for Susan.
Take her away from here as soon as you can. Tomorrow. The next day.
You must promise me. My husband may not allow me to speak to you again.
I must have your promise now.
- What did you talk about?
- What? Oh! You.
I want you to know,
I have the parental blessing.
Well, half of it, anyway.
- My room's supposed to be down here.
- I'll show you.
This is the room. I'll have Merwyn bring up your case.
Susan, how long has your mother been like that?
Ill, you mean?
Well, that and the uh, darkened room, shaded bed.
Not long.
She's been worse the past few days.
And the doctor's forbidden her to have any visitors?
No, she hasn't seen a doctor.
Father wants to look after her himself.
- And what about Helga?
- Helga?
Why all these questions?
Your mother's very concerned about her.
She's disappeared.
Susan, what's going on here?
I don't know, Steve.
What else did you and Mother talk about?
Come here.
Your mother did ask whether my intentions were honourable.
- Are they, Steve?
- What do you think?
You shouldn't have invited Reinhart here.
You're a difficult woman, Letitia.
No. Not difficult.
Only afraid.
Oh, so that's it, huh?
The sins of the fathers, huh?
Well, let me warn you, nothing is going to deter me from my purpose.
- Yes, that's what Corbin said.
- He's dead, Letitia.
He's been dead for a long time.
If there was evil, it's buried with him.
All that remains of Corbin is a few harmless objects in the cellar.
- No! You know how light pains me!
- Why persist in this delusion?
Please, Nahum, close the curtains. Please.
I wonder if you realise how like Corbin you've become.
There's no similarity whatsoever.
I've uttered no incantations.
Neither have I cried out to any of the other so-called... creatures of evil.
- It's only your methods that differ.
- And do you know why?
Because I don't believe in it.
I never have believed in it.
It is you who would perpetuate these blasphemies, these absurdities.
Nahum, I saw your father change from an upright God-fearing man into an old man possessed of the devil.
Whatever happened to my father will not happen to me.
It's already happening.
I could see it happening to you,
Letitia, not to me.
It's happening to all of us.
There's evidence of it all around us.
There is nothing to do with Corbin Witley.
Corbin was invoking the dark powers when he died.
Now, his call is being answered.
So that is why you sent for Stephen Reinhart.
I sent for him to take Susan away.
- What have you told him?
- Nothing.
- Are you sure?
- I don't need to tell him anything.
- He can see for himself.
- I don't want him here.
- One way or another, he must leave.
- He is a guest here, Nahum.
I will not have him interfering.
Would you prefer that I went into the town and showed myself?
The once beautiful Letitia Witley.
Very well.
A day, perhaps, but no more.
Then he must leave.
Well, perhaps by then you will have seen the truth.
The truth?
The truth is that I see the future, and all that I've planned will fill it with a richness we've never known.
Yes, that is what you see.
All that I can see is horror.
Horror!
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a very large room.
Big enough for a king's banquet.
There used to be many parties here in my great-grandfather's time.
- But none since?
- None that I remember.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
Perhaps the name of Witley no longer commands the affection and respect it once did.
Is that why no one in the village would drive me out here?
- You had to walk all that way?
- Mm.
The villagers have no use for us,
Mr Reinhart. The feeling is mutual.
- Merwyn.
- Yes?
Has Mrs Witley had her dinner?
I placed a tray before her, but she didn't want it.
I'll take her up something a little later, Father.
What was that?
Uh, Mr Witley, I um... noticed a strange blackened area on the way to the house.
What happened there?
- There was a fire, Steve.
- A fire?
- Why do you say it like that?
- Well, did you see it?
No, but Father did.
- Why are you so curious?
- Everything is dead in the area.
Nothing grows.
I touched a branch and it fell to ashes.
My daughter had already told you.
There was a fire.
But, Mr Witley, no fire leaves a place like that.
Father's never allowed me to go on the heath.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
After the fire, some villagers disappeared there.
No one's ever explained what happened.
I think, Susan, you're inclined to exaggerate.
I would suggest that you both...
Merwyn!
- What's the matter with him?
- This has happened before.
- But he's unconscious.
- It's perfectly all right.
I know exactly what to do. Susan.
Come on, Steve.
Steve.
Mother? I've brought your dinner.
It's your favourite.
- Take it away.
- You must eat.
Sh.
Quiet, child.
Listen.
- What is it?
- Sh! Quiet.
Yes. Yes!
- Steve!
- What's wrong, honey?
- I saw something outside the window.
- What? Who?
I don't know, but something was staring at me.
Are you sure you weren't imagining it?
- Oh, I don't know. It's this house!
- What about this house, Susan?
There's something in it, something smothering.
- I'm taking you away.
- I wish I could...
- Tonight!
- I can't.
- Why?
- I can't leave Mother how she is.
First she couldn't stand the light.
Now she won't eat.
It was your mother who made me promise to take you away.
- I want to go.
- We're leaving right away.
- It's impossible.
- Tomorrow morning, then.
I'm afraid she won't be any better in the morning.
Oh, Steve. I wish I knew what to do.
- Steve!
- What?
The window!
- Nothing. It's your imagination.
- I'm not imagining it.
We'll discuss it tomorrow.
Now, you have to get some rest.
Oh, Steve. I love you.
And I love you.
Everything's gonna be all right.
It came from downstairs.
- Where does this go?
- It leads to Merwyn's room.
- Father!
- You shouldn't come here.
But the screaming and the noise.
It's Merwyn. He's dead.
It was terrible.
Please go back to your rooms.
Nobody can do anything to help now.
Now, wait a minute.
What's this all about? How did he die?
- He's been ill for a long time.
- Where's the body?
- That's none of your business.
- I think it is my business.
- No, Steve...
- You don't realise what's happened.
This is my house. I ask you to allow me to run my own affairs my own way.
- But a man is dead!
- Steve!
- Get dressed. We're gonna leave now.
- I can't leave now, Steve.
Please don't make trouble.
Good night.
Good night.
- Yes?
- Is the doctor in?
- Did you have an appointment?
- No, but I'd like to speak to him.
- Is it an emergency?
- It's important that I speak to him.
Come inside.
This way.
- You wanted to speak to me?
- Dr Henderson? Steve Reinhart.
I had to talk to you.
Nobody in the village recommended me,
I'm sure.
- I found you in the phone book.
- I've been out of practice for some time.
I didn't come to see you in your professional capacity.
I... Something funny's happening.
The family I'm staying with may be involved.
- Why come to me? Oh, drink?
- No, thanks. It's a little early.
I thought someone objective could help me, give me some information.
- About what?
- About the people I'm staying with.
Why was everyone frightened when I said where I was going?
Frightened? You're talking about the Witley place.
Only "Witley" could bring out that reaction.
- Can you tell me why?
- Sorry, I can't tell you anything.
An old man died out there last night.
I don't give one damn what happened there, neither does this village.
You're scared. You're a doctor, don't you have pride in what you are?
- I may have seen a murder.
- Murder?
- That's right.
- I'm sorry, I can't help. Go away.
You too. What's happened here?
Why is there that fear when "Witley" is mentioned?
Miss Bailey.
Will you show Mr Reinhart to the door?
You asked the doctor about the Witley place.
Can you tell me anything about it, anything about the Witleys?
Only this. Dr Henderson was a good doctor, a wonderful man.
Corbin Witley died in Dr Henderson's arms.
Dr Henderson returned from that visit and he's never been the same.
- What did Corbin Witley die from?
- It's never spoken of.
On the death certificate it said cerebral haemorrhage, but there was no autopsy because there was no funeral, and I'll tell you why.
With the exception of Dr Henderson, no one in the village saw the body.
I've said enough.
I've said more than I ought.
Mother?
Mother, please let me in.
- Susan, dear.
- I heard her moving about.
- Mother, please open this door.
- It's all right. I'll talk to her.
- I've tried to...
- I know, dear. Now, you go along.
I'll talk to her.
Letitia, I must speak to you.
It's very important.
Letitia!
But no one ever goes to the greenhouse at night.
If there was no one inside, why was there a light?
- A light?
- The entire greenhouse... the only word I can think of is glowed.
I've seen a glow like that before, in a radiation lab.
I don't understand. What were you doing outside last night?
- I was watching your father.
- Father?
- What was he doing?
- Burying Merwyn.
- Something else has happened, too.
- What?
I was attacked on the heath.
I'm sure it was Helga.
Oh, Steve.
What's happening?
- Why is the greenhouse locked?
- It never has been before.
- Well, it is now.
- Well, it shouldn't be.
- Have you been in it lately?
- Not since I've been back.
Come on.
Letitia, now listen to me.
It's very important.
I should have done this before.
I'm going to take you to the village, to see the doctor.
Letitia.
How long have these windows been whitewashed?
- They've always been whitewashed.
- There.
- I've never seen that lock before.
- Is there any other way in?
Steve, I don't think we should.
The answer to what's going on may be inside. We've got to get in.
I know a way.
When I was a child, I'd hide from
Merwyn when Mother sent him for me.
I used to get in somewhere here.
Here it is.
- I see it, but I don't believe it.
- How could plants grow like this?
It's fantastic!
Yeah.
How can this happen?
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Remember the cry we heard at dinner last night?
I heard one just like it this morning.
What's in there?
It used to be a potting shed.
Oh, come on, Steve!
It's dark in there, except for a kind of glow.
Oh, Steve! Please come away!
We can't. There's something going on that's affecting all your family.
We shouldn't.
If Father finds out he'll be furious.
Let him. We're not leaving with questions unanswered. Stay here.
No.
- I'm coming with you.
- OK. Come on.
- What is it?
- Those flickering colours.
It must be some kind of energy.
Uranium!
This room is being exposed to some form of radiation.
It's horrible.
It looks like a zoo in hell.
Oh, come on, Steve! Come on!
It's all right!
A menagerie of horrors.
What were they?
Genetic mutations, probably caused by radiation.
It's a scientific fact that exposure to radioactive energy can change characteristics of living things.
It's what happened to these plants, to those creatures.
The scent in here. It's so sweet.
It's sickening.
It's the effect of decay.
- Steve, what is it?
- There's something down here.
This stone's like the ones in the potting shed.
What is it, Steve?
I don't know. I've never seen anything like it before. I wonder if it's an element.
It's giving off heat!
Looks like it's been cut away from some larger stone.
There's one under every plant.
This is the answer. No doubt about it.
- The stones?
- Yeah.
They make everything in here grow this way?
Yeah, and in there, too.
Oh, but Steve!
If it does this to plants...
Exactly, if it affects plants this way after hours and days of exposure, what would it do to a human being?
Mother and Helga.
They worked in here.
Merwyn must have come in contact with these stones, or the larger one from which they were cut!
I wonder where the larger stone could be.
I don't know. In the cellar, perhaps.
- The cellar!
- There are many rooms down there.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yes.
Letitia.
Letitia!
That's the door.
- You stay here.
- You won't find the way.
- I will. Now, go upstairs.
- Oh, Steve. Be careful.
Don't worry.
Where's Reinhart?
I've been looking for him.
- What happened? Where have you been?
- The greenhouse.
- I put a lock on.
- I knew another way in.
- You had no right.
- Why have you kept it a secret?
- Was Reinhart with you?
- Yes.
- Is he still there?
- No.
Where is he? Where is he?
- You're hurting me!
- Tell me where he is.
- He's in the cellar.
- The cellar!
- Father!
- Stay there!
Get out of this room.
I said, get out.
No. Not until you listen to what I have to say.
- I'm in no mood for words!
- Would you prefer death?
- Don't threaten me.
- Everything in this house will die.
Get rid of that stone and the smaller ones, or this house will become like the burned-out area, those monstrosities.
- You don't know what you're saying.
- It destroyed Merwyn.
You want it to destroy your wife,
Susan, destroy you?
- No.
- Listen to that humming sound.
Look at the way it glows.
- It's only a stone. It's harmless.
- You don't believe that, Mr Witley.
You know what it can do.
You know Mrs Witley needs a doctor!
Susan. Are you all right?
- Susan!
- Oh, Steve.
What happened?
It's all right. I got you now.
Susan, are you all right?
- What happened to your mother?
- I don't know.
I heard her smashing things.
I tried to get her to come out.
And then the door burst open and I screamed.
I don't remember anything after that.
Can you get up now?
- I think so.
- Come on.
- Are you OK?
- I'll be all right.
I must find Letitia.
- I must help.
- No. Come on.
Letitia!
Letitia!
Come on.
Letitia!
Let's try this way.
Letitia!
Father?
It's only the wind. Come on.
Letitia.
Steve!
No!
Reinhart, get my daughter out of here.
Please take Susan away.
The evil that Corbin created has finally come to root here.
I refused to listen to her entreaties.
Now Letitia's paid with her life for Corbin's blasphemies.
And my own, too.
Mr Witley, blasphemy had nothing to do with it.
In my heart, I must have known that she was right.
It is as she said.
A curse is set upon this house.
How could I have been so blind as not to know that stone was sent from the other side by the hand of Corbin, reaching out from beyond the grave?
- A curse?
- What do you know of this house?
- Or the people who've lived in it?
- The stone was not sent by anyone.
It's easy for you to say that, but you didn't see it that Sunday morning, screaming out of the heavens to crash and bury itself in the heath.
It fell from the sky!
Then it was a meteorite.
I thought it was a gift from Heaven.
The people from the village came to see, but they wouldn't come near it.
They knew because the fear of Corbin was still in them.
The next morning, the heath was covered with a lush vegetation that should never have grown there.
Why did you bring it into the house?
Why?
Because I thought, as Corbin knew I would...
I thought I'd found a way to turn the wasteland into a place of beauty.
Great vineyards, gardens.
That was my dream.
I thought the name of Witley would mean something once again, and Corbin's iniquities would be atoned for.
Everyone he came in contact with was touched by it.
Father, please come back into the house.
Susan! Stephen, will you take Susan away, please?
What about you?
I will stay here to destroy this monstrous thing.
If you go near it, there can only be one result, and you know what it is.
You seem to forget this is my home.
I live here.
And l, like my father and his father before him, was born here.
I'm an old man and if I'm to die,
- I will die here.
- I'm not leaving without you, Father.
Susan, there's nothing we can do.
Let's go.
Something dreadful's going to happen.
Now, please!
Susan, go with Stephen.
Go away! Go away!
Come on. Let's go and pack.
Helga!
That'll do. Come on.
- Father!
- Stay here.
Mr Witley!
Susan! Get back!
Come on.
Get over there. When I say run, head for the door. Go ahead.
No!
Come on!
- Run, Susan! Run!
- Steve!
Susan! Susan! Hold on!
Oh, Steve.
We're going and we're not gonna look back.
I don't understand, Steve.
Why did all this have to happen?
I don't think it had to happen.
In scientific hands, your father's discovery could have been beneficial.
He used it to fight the only way he knew, for his house and the Witley name.
It was his choice and he made it.
Come on, let's get outta here.
Visiontext Subtitles:. Fran Welland
ENHOH
Lieutenant!
Good morning.
Boy, with a good-looking nurse like that on board, I wouldn't mind running a fever.
Just remember, sailor,
I've got lots of castor oil in sickbay.
And you, too.
Yes, sir... Ma'am.
Lieutenant!
Thanks.
Oh, a gorilla.
Are we going to make surveys of animals on this trip, too, Commander?
No, this is just for our own amusement.
This has nothing to do with our report to the UN.
Well, I don't see how you can be amused by gorillas.
I think they're dull.
Well, this one is 60 feet tall.
What do you think of him?
Sixty feet?
That's right. This is Kong.
The strongest living creature on earth.
Oh, yes, I remember.
A legend.
And yet, underlying that old legend is some truth.
Are you saying that Kong is not just fictional?
Yes, I'll show you.
I've devoted a good many years to research on Kong.
Data I've obtained... shows that a giant anthropoid had lived on an island in this area.
It still may be there.
It may. See this picture?
Right here.
These are steps from some ancient stone ruins.
I thought so, too, when I first saw it.
But those steps are each 10 feet high.
No human can climb that high in one step.
What do you think, Commander?
What I'm trying to figure out is... who built it?
And for what purpose?
Do the islanders really think this was done by a giant ape?
The natives of the Java Sea most definitely believe in Kong.
And, Susan, look at this tunnel.
This is also Kong's work.
Which island is it?
The island is Mondo.
Right there.
Just a little way off our course.
Cdr. Nelson, take us there for a look.
Sorry, we have no time to spare.
We're here to seek oil, you know.
We have our orders from the United Nations Research Council.
I wish there were some way, but...
He's exactly like the original Kong.
With this, the world is ours.
It's still not the original.
- You sure you just didn't build a giant toy?
- A toy?
That's an insult.
How can you say that?
It is the strongest thing there is in the world today.
Need I remind you how I feel about that?
How does it help my government get Element X?
This robot can do anything I program.
You can see that I had it constructed exactly as Carl Nelson planned it.
This man, Nelson, is interesting.
Will you get on to the point?
Most certainly.
The giant Kong was Nelson's model.
This famous scientist researched the legend... and he reconstructed the strongest creature on earth.
You stole it.
Mmm-hmm.
I took his drawings... and my genius translated them into a robot Kong... that can certainly do anything the original Kong would have done.
That ego is showing again.
Remember, my country buys results.
Doctor, we do not underwrite your precious ego.
I quite understand.
I shall soon let my Kong show you that he can certainly do the job.
Obtain Element X, Dr. Who, and you succeed.
My government insists you succeed.
You understand that?
I do, Madame.
We are all ready to start.
You'll observe my creation doing now what's never been done.
We'll go outside.
Forty-two thousand.
Mark!
The rays of Element X are strong.
You are aware the entire world has unearthed... the total of only three ounces of this rare element.
No one could mine, until now, this crater.
Down there is a deposit of tons.
My robot Kong is in position.
After all these years of labor, success has come.
He will bring out
10,000 tons of X, this robot.
We are ready, Doctor.
Test results?
Excellent, sir.
Shortly, your country is going to gain nuclear domination of the universe.
America and the Soviets can never catch up.
Shouldn't we count on this taking years, Doctor?
A hundred days, Madame.
That soon?
Element X is unparalleled.
You'll create a nuclear arsenal fast.
I predict you'll rule the entire world in time.
This is an historic day.
It's quite a treasure you turned up at the North Pole, huh?
Shall we get under way?
All right, you may start.
Right.
That robot is extraordinary.
The real Kong couldn't do what it can.
What's happened?
It's nearly there now.
You did that?
No, sir!
Get out.
What's wrong?
The magnetic mass has destroyed his circuits.
We will start again.
I want you to redesign this circuitry and shield it.
You are to work day and night.
We shall start right now.
Where are you going, Madame?
Don't you know, Doctor?
Don't desert us now.
It's only going to take us a short while longer.
Do what you want to. Our country is withdrawing all aid, Doctor.
You can't do this.
I must ask that you reconsider.
You force me to delay the new construction, and the source of Element X is mine.
Only I can take it.
What if another country gets it, not yours?
Should I take that as a threat?
Your country already has a huge stake in the robot.
I don't suggest you quit.
All right, I'll request that we grant you the extra time you want.
Dr. Who,
I should mention this: more of your blundering, and you're through.
Control Guard.
Control!
Turn it off!
Hey, get him out. Hurry!
Come on, give me your hand.
Up you go. Come on.
Secure the engine.
All stations, report your damage.
How does it look down there?
Hey, something's wrong with the rudder.
Water pipe on the port side broken.
- What happened?
- Rockslide down the canyon wall, sir.
Commander, we should take a look at the rudder.
All right.
Surface for repairs.
Control!
Aye, aye, sir.
Surface, 15 degrees.
We'll have to check the nuclear reactors.
Sir, we're getting the repairs under way.
Thanks.
That rockslide was made to order.
There's a perfect bay for anchoring on that island.
Let's take advantage of it while the ship is being repaired.
You're hurt.
Why didn't you come for treatment right away?
- It's nothing.
- I wish you would do as you're told.
First chance I get to do my job as a nurse, and you...
Oh, my.
What are you laughing at, sir?
I can't help it.
You've got your wish, and I'll get mine.
We'll be landing on Mondo Island.
That's funny.
There are no villagers here this time.
Was the island inhabited?
Do you understand?
Yes. It's a Javanese dialect.
He's warning us not to enter.
He says that it's taboo, and that it must not be broken.
Kong?
Wong. That means, "king."
The natives call him King Kong.
He says we're trespassing on Kong's home.
Do you mean he actually exists?
We'll soon find out.
Let's get hold of the old one and see what else we can learn.
- Susan, you'd better wait here.
- Alone?
You're safer here.
Watch yourself.
This way.
Over there.
No, don't shoot. Wait.
Kong!
Look.
Put me down, Kong.
Put me down!
Down!
Kong, put me down!
Please, Kong. Down.
Susan!
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait. We can't leave him like this.
It's our only chance.
Now come on.
Hurry. We're lost if he catches us this time.
Look, starboard.
He jammed the controls.
Look, there's Kong.
I think we stabilized it.
Hang on. Here we go.
Take the controls.
Stop firing!
Stop firing!
Hold it, men.
This is your commander.
We're coming aboard.
Give the order to dive.
Prepare to dive.
Rig to dive.
All right, sir?
Yes.
Stand by for emergency dive.
We can't, sir.
The rudder's not working yet.
Well, then, we'll just have to make...
Hey!
How are you doing?
Are you through?
Not yet, sir.
- How much longer?
- Should be about 10 minutes more.
That long?
All right. Hurry.
I don't think he means to sink the ship.
Is he playing a game with us?
No.
I don't think he is.
What do you intend to do?
He wants us to get out there, so I'll go out and quiet him down.
Commander, I'll go out.
I won't let you.
Kong let me go when he had me in the palm of his hand.
Commander, let me go, please.
He wants me.
Is there any other way?
All right.
See if you can win some time for us.
We've got to get out of this inlet.
Make preparations to dive.
Make emergency repairs.
Aye, sir.
Susan.
You okay?
Take care.
Kong, please!
Don't shake the ship.
I sleep and I eat on this ship.
Engine rooms, A-okay.
You'd better stand watch outside.
When we're ready to dive, call Susan in.
Put me down. Please!
No. No, Kong.
Take me back.
Take me back to the ship, Kong.
Let's go to the ship. Please.
I don't want to go with you.
Thank you, Kong.
Susan, we're all ready.
Goodbye, Kong.
You gave us quite a scare out there.
Your attention, please.
We're dropping everything and heading directly for UN headquarters in New York.
Our report will create a sensation among the world's scientists.
And you'd better get out of those wet clothes.
Kong is back on shore.
This is Mondo Island, the home of Kong.
And in addition to Kong... there are mammoth reptiles living on the island... that have long since become extinct on other continents.
This island could be called a living museum of the prehistoric age.
This concludes my report.
Are there any questions?
At the meeting of the scientific committee this morning... it was decided to send the Explorer out again.
Is this for the purpose of capturing Kong?
No, not to capture him, but to study him in his natural habitat.
It would be, to say the least, difficult to care for him here in New York.
Will you be accompanied by the same crew?
Yes. Essentially the same crew will go on the expedition.
Especially Lt. Cdr. Nomura and Miss Watson, sitting here beside me.
They are very well-known to Kong.
Kong was apparently gentle with Lt. Watson. May I ask why?
Miss Watson, do you know a reason you can tell me?
It's very easy for us to understand.
You see, as ridiculous as it may sound...
Kong is a male and Miss Watson is...
Well, see for yourselves, gentlemen.
If there are no further questions...
I will now turn the meeting over to the Chairman of the Council.
Thank you very much for your kind attention.
Code signal, LCM3.
Go ahead.
My country is going to grant you more time.
Nelson sold you on the Kong, huh?
We can now use his Kong to do the digging for us.
The real Kong's a mammal.
Could he stand the radiation, Doctor?
Kong can resist it better than anything.
He cannot stand it forever, though.
We will only need the big beast a day or two, you know.
I think that, that will have to do.
I agree.
Now I shall go after him.
Can you get Kong to obey you?
You should consider that,
Doctor.
You should know that I do.
You should also know, we can't go on without your aid.
You can do this without additional aid.
You can control Kong as Nelson did.
A woman is the secret.
Susan Watson got Kong to do anything she asked.
Might I ask, what do we do with Watson and Nelson when we're through?
That is quite easy.
Merely a dirty detail.
I'll support you
30 days more.
How you do it is your concern.
I want you to succeed.
I should hate to hear that you had died.
Must proceed quickly.
The Explorer, with Nelson, will be here any day.
- Your copters should be ready right now.
- Yes, sir.
There he is.
- All right, get ready.
- Ready, sir.
Away.
That's good. Let's land.
Excellent.
Hook up to him.
Yes, yes. Kong's mine now.
Ready to go, sir.
That's good.
Prepare to land.
This proves Kong's still on the island.
Yeah, I think he's still here.
Had a recent rendezvous.
He must be near here someplace.
We don't want to excite him, so just the three of us will go on from here.
Aye, sir. Let's go.
Kong's opponents were human beings.
It smells like ether.
Lieutenant... have the men collect samples of these shell casings.
Then let's spread out and search for Kong.
We should be able to find him easily enough, if he's lying around someplace.
Okay, get going.
It looks like Kong escaped after putting up a terrific battle.
Yes. Still, I don't know.
Carl! Carl!
Here.
He's been shot.
Is there any chance?
What did he say?
He said that an Oriental skeleton... a devil with eyes like a gutter rat... kidnapped Kong and took him away into the skies.
- Lieutenant, see that he has a decent burial.
- Yes, sir.
Was he the only one here?
It looks that way.
Wish we could have talked to the old one sooner.
He told us enough.
I have an idea who the kidnapper is.
It must be my old friend... that international
Judas, Dr. Who.
Send this rush to New York.
Aye, aye.
"Proceed immediately to Station 6318, north.
"Start investigation at the nearest field office."
Right here. That's Tokyo.
It looks like an
Asiatic country is tied in.
A check in Tokyo will tell us where this came from.
I don't know.
Do you really think we can locate Kong?
Sure. We'll find him.
As long as they haven't taken him to the North Pole.
All right.
Come down.
Knock before you enter next time.
All right, state what it is you want.
New York, huh?
The UN has begun to ask a lot of questions about us.
The members of the UN Science Council already know this name.
Don't worry about them.
You sure you removed all evidence?
Yes. Worry not.
I can outwit the UN any day and anytime.
Did you see our giant ape?
My thought is that under ether he won't be much use.
You underrate what a genius I am.
I can control the ape.
Will he do as you order?
Hypnotic susceptibility.
That's the secret.
Hypnosis?
A creature with Kong's intelligence is easily handled.
That's another little thing
I learned through Carl Nelson.
Recall, Doctor. You agreed that you would get Carl Nelson's crew... so that they could handle
Kong, yes?
Nelson and his crew will be on their way soon.
This is their last trip.
They will aid us as needed, then we will just do away with them.
A Japanese aircraft
is calling the Commander.
I will connect you, sir.
Roger. Put him through. Over.
An emergency has arisen.
I have been sent
from the UN Field Office...
to transport you to Tokyo
as fast as possible.
Cdr. Nelson, Lt. Cdr. Nomura,
and Lt. Watson...
are requested to immediately collect
all pertinent evidence...
and transfer to this aircraft.
Over and out.
Right here.
What is this emergency situation?
The Kong has gone ashore at Hokkaido, sir.
Hokkaido?
Yes, early today.
We're under orders to take you and your crew there right away.
I don't trust the pilot.
And I don't think they're Japanese.
Release him.
Is it all right?
He'll do whatever I say.
Kong, you are to obey these orders.
Listen. Element X is in the crater.
You will go out there and dig it up.
That tunnel will take him right into our crater.
Let's hope that nothing goes wrong now.
Kong, you must dig faster.
Kong!
Continue.
Go ahead. Remember, you're to dig it up.
My Kong could never dig like that.
Kong, what's the matter?
You're slowing down.
Wake up!
Dig!
Kong, you must do
as I order. Dig.
Continue to dig. Kong!
Wake up.
You shall not sleep.
Wake up!
Dig!
Dig, Kong. Dig.
Can't you hear?
Go on, you idiot ape.
Kong. Kong, wake up.
I command you.
Dig, you dumb beast.
Out. Get away.
Let's go again.
Kong, once again. Dig!
The beast has escaped.
Close the tunnel, quick.
Right.
Just as I thought. Kong could very easily stand the radiation.
Unluckily, we couldn't maintain the power that we had.
- Now what?
- Sir, Nelson's in the laboratory.
Oh!
Carl Nelson is here now?
Aye.
They constructed a robot just like ours.
Looks like Dr. Who wasn't satisfied with a robot.
He wanted the real Kong.
Carl, glad you could come.
Nomura, you, too.
Been a long time.
Obviously, not enough years to suit me.
What is this all about?
Is Kong here?
Yes.
That's where he is usually kept.
What do you think of this Kong?
Do you recognize your brainchild?
You'd steal Niagara Falls for a drink of water.
But... you want the real Kong to do something the robot can't do.
Right?
I'm after X, Nelson.
Element X?
Mmm-hmm.
Under the ice here is all I want.
Only Kong's muscle can get it all out.
You know what we can get from him.
You can't use the robot, huh?
And Kong won't do what you want him to do.
- That's why you brought us here.
- You are so right.
You think we'll agree to help you?
I predicted you would not.
Will you, Lt. Watson?
I won't help you, either.
We shall see.
Come.
Well, this is great.
It's a pretty odd lab.
So this is Dr. Who's guest room.
With no color television.
At least we can joke a little.
Actually,
I'm awfully afraid.
We all are, Susan.
If Who manages to extract the Element X... there'll be no object in keeping us alive.
Nelson, you are to come.
Hello there.
Won't you sit down?
Would you like a drink?
Yeah. Why not?
You know,
I'm slightly confused.
You take your typical
Oriental Mata Hari, now...
What are you saying?
Let me put it this way.
If you'll excuse the corny cliché... what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
My answer is a corny cliché.
Did you ever hear it?
Don't judge a book according to its cover.
Or a snake, by its color.
That's well-put.
What's your connection with Dr. Who?
Business.
But you should know that I don't really want to go on in it.
Tell me one thing first.
Do you work for him, or does he work for you?
Does life here in the North interest you?
My dear, we can easily get all the world capitals.
London, Paris...
I can arrange it so this lab is yours.
Please stay here with me.
You can run the whole thing, Carl.
If the money holds out.
What if there's no country to buy Element X... once you mine it?
You don't have to be worried about that.
You're not Japanese. Chinese?
Thai? Vietnam? Burma?
You're getting warm, Carl.
Getting too warm.
All right.
He's a hard one to handle.
Nelson's an unusual man.
He is not the kind of man that you are used to.
That's why he appeals to me.
An idealist.
But I know how to make him do anything we want.
Susan. Look at it this way: it can only get better.
Because it certainly can't get any worse.
Carl, look.
Carl, may I see you outside?
What is it this time?
Torture?
It's been too long since we've had a game of chess together.
Your two friends are quite affectionate.
They could be happy, if you don't interfere.
Susan.
Now the cell temperature is zero.
You know they can't stand the bitter cold.
You know what will happen, unless you rescue them.
Only a little cooperation will do it.
Susan, here.
This will...
No, Jiro.
It's better this way.
If you'd just cooperate... those young people could be enjoying a little hot tea right now, Carl.
Kong will listen more to those two than to me.
Check.
Those walls are being turned into ice.
Why won't you save them?
Why should you endure this when it is not necessary?
Nelson cannot aid you any longer.
He's been cancelled.
You dog.
I am a realist, and I need you.
So I am going to be generous.
I will let you go without a bit of trouble and with lots of cash.
You just have to do one thing for me.
You think I wouldn't kill you?
I could and I would.
Susan!
Susan!
Jiro!
Jiro!
Do you think you can change your ideals now?
Are you ready with an answer right now?
Susan, don't do it.
Shut up.
Let's see how your hero likes you when you're disfigured a little bit.
Let's see what the ice will do to your lovely skin.
No. Susan!
It's Kong.
It's Kong.
Kong's escaped.
Get the keys.
Hurry, Susan.
Kong's escaped!
Look out!
The robot is ready.
Go get that ape.
- You're still alive.
- How did you get out of the chamber?
- Dr. Who left the keys on the desk...
- Talk later. We've got to go.
This way.
Don't worry, there's no poison in this.
It looks like we have all failed.
Let's forget Element X and enjoy a drink.
Stand up.
Can Kong stay in the water a long time?
Yes, he can swim a little.
More than you can.
He travels from Mondo to other islands as he pleases.
Don't you realize that you are through, Doctor?
We're all through.
We are all leaving now in pursuit. Get ready to go.
You're a failure.
Not a chance of that.
You'll see when I get Kong, and this girl will do what I say.
Get going.
Ready. Lower.
Let it down.
The radio just had some interesting news.
Kong swam ashore, near Tokyo.
Don't go. Don't take that robot into Tokyo.
I cannot permit it.
Wait. It could be our last chance to get Kong.
At sea, our robot Kong cannot get him.
On ground, the machine will take the real Kong without any doubt.
I'm not concerned about which one wins.
There's too great a risk.
It just can't be.
Why are you so highhanded,
Madame?
If those two fight in Tokyo... thousands would get killed, and you and I know it.
Suddenly, you're such a moralist.
Tell us, how come?
Element X is a real killer.
Not millions, not 10 millions...
100 or so millions would get killed this time.
It's just that my country...
We can't stand an international incident right now.
Dear Madame, let's talk inside.
The giant Kong has swum ashore...
and he's approaching
the center of Tokyo.
The Defense Agency urgently requests
all citizens to take shelter immediately.
Take shelter immediately.
Please, we should hurry.
Why are you helping us now?
My work now isn't so important, but you are.
Something happen between you and Dr. Who?
I can't tell you.
When you get to shore, lead Kong outside Tokyo.
Otherwise, thousands will get killed.
You're coming with us.
Sorry. I can't do it.
You can't stay behind, you'll be alone.
You don't know what Dr. Who will do.
Don't worry about it.
The things you're going to need are in the next cabin.
We just can't let you stay here.
You should know that I represent a certain country.
I'll take full responsibility for you.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry my country wasn't right.
Now hurry.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Good luck.
Hey, you!
Where are you going? Hey, you!
Don't use that gun.
You'll get the whole country out here.
Don't do it! Don't!
Here's where he came ashore.
He first appeared in the bay, here.
Stop your attack immediately.
If you force Kong to fight, he'll destroy the city.
- Who are you?
- I'm... Well, I'm out of uniform... but I'm Cdr. Carl Nelson, captain of the UN submarine, Explorer.
Yes.
Now, we'll do everything we can to try and calm him down.
But you must hold off your troops.
Hey!
Let me go.
Please, don't.
He'll get angry.
Then he'll destroy the city.
Headquarters.
Turn off lights. Fall back.
Fall back.
That's right, sir. Hold it!
Hey!
It's all right.
Kong!
The UN?
Yeah.
Take this. Here.
Kong!
Kong!
Is she insane?
She's all right.
Kong is always gentle with her.
Calm down, Kong.
We're your friends.
Hey! Look at that!
Oh, no.
Come on, take shelter.
Hurry!
Where can we go?
Look at that.
No, Kong, run away.
You mustn't fight him.
It's not alive, it's a machine.
You can't defeat him, Kong.
Kong! Run away! Run away!
The real Kong seems quicker.
My Kong won't tire.
Behind you. Get the girl.
Kong! Kong!
Kong, listen!
You will return quietly
to the ship.
If you don't,
I'll drop the girl.
Help me. Kong!
We will get him now.
Prepare to dock the ship.
You each know your job.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well?
My plans were really correct.
We're a success.
A gun, Madame?
You're going to die.
Step back there and turn around.
What did you do?
Nothing.
I'm Nomura with the UN.
Yes, sir.
- I need a ranger unit, order it.
- Right.
On the double!
Susan, wait.
Wait there.
Jiro.
Hold on.
Go on. Easy.
Go get them a rope.
Susan, don't worry.
We're just about there.
Kong.
Susan!
Jiro!
There they are.
Susan.
Quick, the other control.
Stop it, let her go.
Hey, get out of here.
Let's go!
Go!
- Susan!
- Commander!
Thank God, you're alive.
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all over now.
Weigh anchor right away.
What's wrong here?
Shouldn't we wait till Kong is brought here?
Moron! The real Kong is lost to us.
Kong's coming!
He's here, on the docks.
Kong's on the docks?
Yes.
We have to go.
You said we were here... to get Kong and the girl.
No, get us out of here now.
Now! Do as I say.
Kong, stop that ship.
Get the ship, Kong.
Sir, hello.
Will he catch it?
Yeah. I think he will.
On deck. Let's go.
There he is.
Let's get him.
Keep firing.
Let's go.
Kong! Kong!
King Kong!
Don't call.
Yeah, let him go.
But he's going...
He's going home.
I think he's had enough of what we call civilization.

ENRICHED NUCLEAR FUEL
FUJI ASTRONAUTICAL FLIGHT CENTER
Don't jostle it.
Dr. Kato, everything's proceeding smoothly.
Glad to hear it.
That concludes point nine.
Our calculations show we'll land on Mars on schedule.
Telemetry information confirms that conclusion.
Captain Sano.
Our ultimate objective is to land on Mars.
All previous Mars missions have failed for unknown reasons.
The cause may have been UFOs - unidentified flying objects - that they encountered.
If that is so, where are they from?
Mars? Venus?
I'll put it simply:
Your job is to determine what's stopping us from reaching Mars.
Sadly, many of our best people died on those missions.
They'll be drifting through space forever.
Our finest scientific minds have designed a nuclear-powered spaceship.
But even this ship, the AAB-Gamma, may be no shield from dangers and difficulties.
Please be careful, and exercise good judgment.
Yes, sir.
Lisa.
As space biologist, your duty is to collect any unknown substances, but only with Captain Sano's express permission.
Dr. Shioda, you are to send daily reports on the crew's blood tests.
Signal Officer Miyamoto.
- Yes, sir?
As a precaution, transmit your call sign within two minutes after the capsule leaves the booster.
The enriched XTU249 nuclear fuel brought by Dr. Behrman has been successfully loaded onto your ship, which we have nicknamed the Astro-Boat.
Our geiger counters register no radiation on board, so have no fear as you carry out your mission.
Dr. Behrman, anything to add?
Astro-Boat crew,
the launch pad is ready.
One final word:
We have the utmost faith in our new rocket, but no matter what happens, human lives come first.
As scientists, this is our cardinal rule.
I pray for your success.
- Be careful.
- Thank you.
Astro-Boat crew,
board your vessel.
Lisa, your pulse meter shows your heart is racing.
I can almost hear it pounding.
Don't worry.
Yours is pounding even louder.
Miyamoto.
Worry about yourself, not the others.
Goodness! Why?
On our last mission, a certain someone talked up a storm without first remembering to turn the mic on.
Did you have to bring that up in front of the lady?
Some people!
- Initiate final check.
- All hands, commence final check.
- Nuclear fuel gauge.
- Check.
Oxygen pressure gauge.
Check.
Attitude stabilizer.
Check.
Escape velocity gauge.
Check.
Prepare for launch!
All crew in position!
T minus 10 seconds.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Blast off!
Five seconds to capsule separation.
Release!
Cabin oxygen pressure normal.
Hey!
Lisa!
Sorry about that.
You may now move about the cabin.
There's no better view of the earth.
It's beautiful.
That big green marble is our home.
Behrman, care for a smoke?
No, thanks.
I'll just have some coffee.
Previous missions couldn't have failed due to equipment malfunction alone.
Indeed. The cause must have been the UFOs.
First of all, radio signals died out immediately after the objects appeared, radio signals died out immediately after the objects appeared, suggesting a magnetic storm of some kind that would disable the ships' guidance systems.
Secondly, the instrument malfunctions were consistent with exposure to cosmic rays.
Are you saying the UFO unleashed magnetic storms and radioactive dust?
That's right.
Given current scientific knowledge, that's the best explanation available.
If the object appeared on a periodic basis, we could assume it was orbiting our solar system, but it appears irregularly, and only when our spaceships approach.
We must assume something is controlling it.
Yes... but is it being controlled from Mars, or is it perhaps a decoy satellite being controlled from somewhere on earth?
Sano, I've detected increased radioactivity.
The cosmic ray belt is especially wide this time.
Doctor, how are radioactivity levels on board?
I don't think we need to worry.
AAB-Gamma, come in, please.
What's that?
It's a UFO:
An unidentified flying object.
A flying saucer, huh?
So that's what's jamming our transmissions!
Looks like a half-cooked omelet!
It seems to be observing us.
It's matching our speed.
Doctor.
Dr. Shioda!
Doctor!
What's the matter?
Miyamoto, still no luck with mission control?
Hear for yourself.
I can't make out a word.
All right, speed up!
Everyone buckle up!
Lisa, we're moving in closer.
Sano, we should treat
Dr. Shioda first.
I'm the one who decides around here.
I'm pleading with you.
The doctor is ill.
Human life comes first.
He knows that!
Lisa, the doctor is a veteran astronaut.
Doctor...
Lisa, I'm a physician.
I know my own body better than anyone.
Lisa, back in your seat.
AAB-Gamma, this is FAFC.
AAB-Gamma, this is FAFC.
Come in, over.
FAFC, this is AAB-Gamma.
Come in, over.
The flying saucer has disappeared from our radar.
Do not pursue.
See to Dr. Shioda.
Make an emergency landing
on our moon base.
When you pick up
the lunar beacon,
Switch to guided approach mode.
- Roger.
This is Moon Base MSC.
Come in, AAB-Gamma.
This is Miyamoto
of AAB-Gamma. Go ahead.
Guided approach beacon is on.
You are cleared to land.
Lock on to the beacon signal.
Bearing is moon sector N53.
Roger.
Captain, Lisa.
Look, it's Michiko.
Hello there, Michiko.
How are you?
Please advise when you lock on
to the guidance control signal.
This is Moon Base MSC.
- You're on our radar, over.
- Roger.
Michiko, by the way - she seemed pretty ticked off.
Sano, did something happen between you two?
AAB-Gamma is coming in too fast, even for an emergency landing.
They should slow down or they'll overshoot the target.
Be a dear and tell them for me.
But that's your -
Fine! I'll call Earth.
They can tell them.
Doctor, here you go.
Wait your turn.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Here.
Thanks!
Prepare for landing.
Close the oxygen valve.
Depressurize the cabin.
Cabin pressure is zero, equalized with the exterior.
Fasten your seatbelts.
That was a close call.
- Long time no see.
- Thanks for coming.
You haven't changed.
- This is Michiko.
- How do you do?
Delighted to meet you.
Well, then, let's go!
The moon's a nice place.
Yes, much more charming than I imagined.
- Blood pressure?
- Normal.
My blood pressure and heart rate were abnormally high, and I was dying of thirst.
It's space sickness.
Your body couldn't adjust to the changes in pressure.
You'll be flne with a little rest in this controlled environment.
But we're leaving for Mars soon.
That's not my decision to make.
Wow, that's big!
So now you're raising apples on the moon?
Yes.
There's no atmosphere to block the sunlight, so they grow huge.
But they're bland compared to earth apples.
Beggars can't be choosers!
Michiko, I have something for you.
Earrings from germany.
They're gorgeous!
Thank you.
I checked everyone's belongings.
You snuck those past me.
- I'm sorry.
But I thought Michiko would like them.
It's okay, isn't it?
But I thought Michiko would like them.
It's okay, isn't it?
Isn't it?
At least here we get a chance to bathe.
I didn't know there was so much water on the moon.
There's no water on the moon.
It's artificial.
- Same thing.
- No, it's not.
It's synthesized from the oxygen and hydrogen in moon rocks.
It's not natural.
It's synthetic.
Therefore it's completely pure.
Not polluted, like some people.
That's a cheap shot.
You jerk! That's hot!
How was your trip?
It was such fun.
Mr. Sano was so nice.
He was?
Then there's nothing to worry about on the trip to Mars.
That's right.
I'd follow Sano anywhere, no matter how long or hard the journey.
This is groovy!
I can't believe we're on the moon.
But this is no place to settle down.
Man's place is on earth.
You complain wherever you are, don't you, Dr. Stein?
Of course.
If humanity grows complacent, it's finished.
Please sit down.
What'll it be?
- Cognac.
- Me too.
- All right.
Earth needs to send a replacement for Dr. Shioda.
That's for FAFC to decide.
Orders from FAFC:
Dr. Shioda will be replaced by Dr. Stein.
It's not my job to go all the way to Mars!
But you're the one who declared me physically unfit for space travel.
- That has nothing to do with this.
- Dr. Stein.
Our job is to follow
FAFC's orders.
May I have this dance?
Lisa, good night.
How about dancing with me?
Okay.
I don't care if it's an order.
Mars?
Are they kidding?
I should be back on earth with my wife.
Come on, cheer up.
- Take care of yourself.
- I should say the same.
- Look after him.
- Bye.
Our data suggest there are many aliens and asteroids between here and Mars, so be careful.
Understood.
- Take care of yourselves.
- Thanks.
Bye, Michiko.
- Good-bye.
Hey, Miyamoto!
Leaving already?
See you guys later!
Keep your spirits up!
Finally.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Again?
The same space rations every day.
Dr. Stein, you can't be picky on a spaceship.
You could at least vary the menu a bit.
I'm a scientist, not a cook.
Excuse me!
If Dr. Shioda hadn't suddenly fallen ill,
I'd be on earth now, eating tasty food with my beloved wife.
Am I right?
Why did this have to happen to me?
What did I do to deserve this?
Muzzle it!
- At least let me talk.
- Quiet!
You hear that?
Asteroids!
Small asteroids are hitting the ship.
Keep calm!
Full speed ahead in the same direction as the asteroids.
Tell mission control we're changing course.
Helmets on!
- Lisa, close your helmet!
- I can't!
Lisa, are you okay?
Stein, close the oxygen valve!
Miyamoto, I can't do it, help!
- Doctor!
- Miyamoto!
Something's definitely wrong.
Sir, a call from the moon base.
We've lost contact with AAB-Gamma.
What about you?
Still no reply.
Radar shows them far off course.
There's also heavy radio interference.
Keep tracking them.
Advise if you make contact.
Roger.
They'll soon enter the region where past missions met their untimely ends.
I hope nothing happens.
If it does, we can only assume some unknown power is blocking our entry into martian airspace.
Repairs are complete.
Miyamoto, main lights on.
Sano.
It's back!
Quick, let's get away!
All right.
I'm speeding up!
We're being pulled in.
Why'd you cut the engine?
They'll pull us in even faster.
It's a waste of fuel.
We won't have enough to get back.
Don't stop the engine.
We have to get away!
It's hopeless.
Their tractor beam is too strong.
Better to watch and wait than waste our fuel.
That's suicide! That's how previous ships were destroyed!
I'm gonna throttle it!
- Stein, don't!
Stein, don't!
Stein, stop it!
- I'm getting us out of here!
- Stop it!
Something's definitely wrong.
Please send a rescue rocket.
I'll go.
But what if we send a rescue rocket and it winds up like the Astro-Boat?
I won't let any more lives be sacrificed.
Sacrificed?
Captain Sano, sacrificed?
Doctor stein, please read the nuclear fuel gauge.
Yes, sir.
- Lisa, check the main thrusters,
- yes, sir.
Sano, energy output has dropped more than half.
How can that be?
Miyamoto, still no luck wlth the radio?
- Give me a bit longer.
Sano, come here!
What's that?
Sano, please don't!
It's dangerous out there.
Sano, she's right.
Wait until we know what's going on.
- I'm going too.
- You fix the radio and contact base.
- I'm going with you.
- No.
I'm going.
Lisa, are you sure?
I can at least try.
FAFC, this is AAB-Gamma.
Come in!
- Good work.
- What was it?
FAFC, this is AAB-Gamma.
AAB-Gamma, come in please.
The flying saucer emitted
clouds of vapor in our direction
and then flew towards Mars.
The reactor is only at half power
for some reason we can't accelerate,
even at full thrust.
We're in possession
of a mysterlous luminous object.
Our navigatinal instruments
are disabled.
We can't determine
our present position.
How's the crew?
Lisa, Miyamot, Stein, and Sano
are all unharmed.
The UFO's powerful
magnetlc field and radiation
seem responsible
for your ship's condition.
Remain as you are
and wait for the rescue rocket.
Keep the luminous object
in a sealed vacuum container.
Roger.
Moon Base MSC, come in.
This is Moon Base MSC.
It's Michiko!
Launch a rescue rocket
with replacement XTU fuel immediately.
Follow our designated flight path.
Roger.
Now I'll finally see my wife.
- And I'll get to eat earth food.
- Let's wait for that rocket.
Doctor... that luminous object they found - what could it be?
Any ideas?
None whatsoever.
I've never seen accounts of such a thing.
Surely it came from the UFO.
That's very possible.
Michiko!
Lisa! Thank goodness!
Thanks for coming.
Now let's replace that fuel.
Since it was collected in a vacuum, it must be observed in one.
That's probably best.
After all, we know nothing about it.
But our observations won't be complete unless we expose it to our atmosphere.
Hey, research is fun and all, but you gotta rest sometime.
He's right.
Let's call it a day.
Let's have a party at my house to celebrate your safe return.
Good idea.
I expected a cold reception after we failed to land on Mars.
Not at all.
This object in itself is a gift to science.
Let's go.
You were in a lot of danger.
I'm glad I fell ill.
Dr. Shioda,
I'll follow your example and come down with space sickness too!
Dr. Kato!
The center's research laboratory is calling.
Kato speaking.
What?
The lab was ransacked?
And the alien object?
The container and table were wrecked, and there's a hole in the floor.
I'll be right there.
Doctor, what happened?
I'm going too.
It burned its way through.
It takes a lot of heat to burn through such material.
Laser rays.
Quite possibly.
At least we still have the rock's insulating material.
Who knows when we'd find another such specimen.
That's right.
Give me the tongs.
Put it in here.
Sir.
That's a strange indentation.
Looks just like a chicken's claw print.
That means the luminous rock burned through the iron table, then through the floor, and entered the earth.
An extraterrestrial may have been hiding inside.
Assuming that's the case, where did it go after going into that hole?
Voltage is plummeting.
Any problems with the generators?
None at all?
That's odd.
That just can't be.
How about a nightcap?
Sounds good.
What do you all say?
- What's going on?
- That's strange.
What's up?
I'm sorry. We've been having blackouts the past few days.
We'll check on it right away.
What's wrong?
Captain Sano, what's that?
See? Beyond that hill.
Let's get out of here!
Look! What's that?
It's just like the claw print in the lab.
You're right.
Let's get back.
Come on.
On the right is the print left in our laboratory.
On the left is the print left by the monster on Hakone.
Our analysis suggests these two are one and the same.
The monster is now on a rampage, headed for Tokyo.
It must not enter Tokyo!
We doubt whether our present arsenal can actually stop this monster.
Dr. Kato, isn't there a scientific solution?
Not at the moment, unfortunately.
This is the material cast off by the alien.
And this is the substance that clung to our rocket engine.
Our analysis clearly shows the two are identical in chemical composition.
This substance may therefore contain the secret to combating this "Guilala."
"Guilala" is what we've decided to name the monster.
Space monster Guilala.
200 feet tall and weighing 15,000 tons can the cosmic substance subdue Guilala?
World anxiously awaits analysis of spores.
Lisa, how does it look?
Discover anything yet?
The function of the substance is still a mystery.
It seems to have been formed within a supernova.
The vacuum of space made it condense rapidly and take on a complex organic molecular structure, forming Guilala and his luminous shell.
If the substance can reflect and contain enormous amounts of energy, then Guilala's shell must be able to do the same.
If we want to synthesize the substance, we have to do it in a complete vacuum - the surface of the moon, for example.
I see.
Lisa, you must go to the moon.
We have to hurry.
Guilala's wreaking havoc across japan.
This substance just may stop him.
Captain.
If you're going, so am I.
Me too.
Alert! Defense personnel
assemble immediately.
- How's it look up there?
- Ginza and Shinjuku were wiped out.
Report from sector one.
Good.
What's the latest?
- Tatebayashi's been destroyed.
- And the monster's condition?
Guilala's dorsal fin is glowing less brightly.
He must be losing energy.
- He's used most of it up.
- Looks that way.
This is our chance to kill him.
But if he's hungry, he might become even more destructive.
This is FAFC.
Lisa, how are the experiments with the Guilalanium?
We were able to synthesize it here on the moon.
We've also discovered ample Guilalanium in the lunar ore.
What are its attributes?
It can reflect all types of cosmic rays, including intense heat energy.
Roger. Bring us a large quantity, and fast.
Roger.
If we smother Guilala with Guilalanium, he will cease absorbing energy and probably weaken.
Would you agree?
Indeed.
Some suggest we use the bomb, but our allies have cold feet.
Some suggest we use the bomb, but our allies have cold feet.
America in particular doesn't want to drop another A-bomb on japan.
I share that sentiment.
FAFC, this is AAB-Gamma.
Come in, please.
We're returning with the Guilalanium on board.
Still no contact?
The radio's working, but something's jamming the signal.
It's that darn flying saucer again!
No, it's not.
This is odd.
They're out of the flying saucer's range.
It's impossible to know when they'll arrive.
We must stop Guilala as soon as possible.
Must be an electronic malfunction.
Lisa, check the computer.
Yes, sir.
Sano! I've got it.
This is the cause right here.
Bring me that.
Roger.
Northwest Tochigi Prefecture.
Command center here.
Commander, phone call.
Commanding officer speaking.
So you don't know when the Guilalanium will arrive?
We're unable to track
AAB-Gamma's current position.
The monster's growing more violent.
He's heading north to northern Kanto, near Lake Inawashiro.
The damage continues to mount.
We can only have faith in Captain Sano and pray they return quickly.
What do we do now?
I don't know.
We may wind up orbiting the sun forever.
Or the earth may pull us into its orbit.
Wouldn't that help our chances?
It'd take years for earth to pull us in that close.
Can't we lessen the Guilalanium's reflectivity?
We'd have to find some kind of shield and place it inside that.
But how?
What about the nuclear reactor?
It has thick walls built to seal in radioactivity.
Good idea.
But a dangerous one.
The Guilalanium could cause the reactor to overheat:
It could explode in an instant.
Are you prepared to take that chance?
What if it's the only way?
Let's do it!
All right.
After destroying
Inawashiro Dam,
Guilala is now heading for the Pacific coast.
Commander, it's from FAFC.
What?
It destroyed the atomic research center and power plant?
It absorbed all the atomic energy and is stronger than ever?
It's turned into a ball of energy, bouncing from place to place.
It bounced from Matsudo to Tokyo and is now headed west.
What?
Guilala's headed this way?
Isn't the Astro-Boat back yet?
We could really use that Guilalanium right now.
I'm sure Sano and his crew are doing their best.
Guilala's surely looking for more energy.
Then there's a good chance he's coming this way.
You're right.
We just completed the storage unit for your XTU nuclear fuel.
Sir, we've made contact with AAB-Gamma.
AAB-Gamma, we're defenseless against Guilala.
We eagerly await your return.
Please deliver the Guilalanium as soon as possible.
Roger.
We're headlng dlrectly...
AAB-Gamma, come in.
This is FAFC.
It's back!
Damn it!
Persistent creeps!
What a nuisance!
They're never satisfied.
We have to deliver this Guilalanium fast.
Full power ahead.
Everyone buckle up.
Hurry!
Damn it!
It's coming back!
Dr. Kato,
Guilala is approaching FAFC.
You're in danger.
We can't wait for the Astro-Boat.
Prepare to evacuate.
Very well.
But I can't leave until the Astro-Boat returns.
I understand.
But Guilala will surely destroy FAFC before then.
Attention:
All personnel except Astro-Boat landing crew, evacuate immediately.
Guilala is coming this way.
Dr. Kato, it's from the Astro-Boat.
This is AAB-Gamma.
Come in, FAFC.
This is FAFC, over.
We've evaded the UFO and are now commencing reentry.
The Astro-Boat's returned?
Yes, all planes are ready to scramble.
Get the Guilalanium here pronto!
Let's evacuate.
Guilala is coming for the XTU.
But if he consumes it, he can do even more damage.
Let's get it out of here.
- Can you do it?
- We can try.
All right.
Hurry up!
Captain Sano!
What is it?
- It's Lisa!
- What happened?
The lab exploded.
She's stuck under debris.
What?
What was she doing there?
She went back for some research data.
Let's go! Take this.
Help me!
What happened?
My legs!
I can't pull my legs out!
- Use that beam!
- Where?
She's pinned!
Are you all right?
Other side.
Add another beam.
Find another one!
Damn it!
It's coming this way! he's always drawn to energy.
Dr. Behrman, let's use the fuel as bait to lure Guilala away from the lab.
That's a risky gambit.
Miyamoto, let's go!
Left. Stop.
Man, it's really gotten huge!
Hurry!
Go!
Miyamoto, you okay?
Floor it!
Faster!
Faster!
Okay, we can get out.
We have to hurry.
Careful.
Are you all right?
Everyone in?
Captain Sano and Signal Officer Miyamoto risked their lives to lead Guilala away from FAFC.
But the monster has absorbed the enriched nuclear fuel and is returning to FAFC in search of more energy.
Our last hope for stopping Guilala rests in your courage and unexcelled airmanship.
You must quickly spray the monster with Guilalanium, thus blocking its ability to absorb energy.
Eighth fighter squadron, loaded with Guilalanium!
Very good.
Launch your attack!
Yes, sir.
Present arms!
Ground chief.
Load the remaining squadrons with Guilalanium.
Yes, sir.
- Are you okay?
- Damn! I think I sprained my ankle.
We're coming!
It's too dangerous for you here!
Try to hold on.
See what you can do for him.
Are you all right?
Give me a handkerchief.
Hasn't the air force launched yet?
Not yet.
There they are!
No effect yet.
Be patient, Doctor.
Sir!
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
In the car, quick.
Look!
Guilala's dying.
He's shrinking.
Lisa, please step away.
- May I have the container?
- Give it here.
Guilala can't be destroyed here on earth.
If he manages to slough off the Guilalanium, he could reemerge as strong as before.
We have to get rid of him somehow.
Let's send him back into space.
Back where he came from.
Three... two... one...
Blast off!
Have you told Sano how you really feel?
Love takes courage.
Yes.
You're right.
Guilala taught me an important lesson.
Thanks to him,
I now realize... that there's somebody else who loves Sano with all her heart.
You know...
I wonder where Guilala is going.
Someplace many biilions of light-years away.
He'll wander through space forever.
Captain Sano?
Never mind.
Beyond the moon and stars
to the far ends of the sky
with no final destination
in this infinite world
how small, how small
two people can be
how small, how small
two people can be
The End
Excuse me, Mr. Filby!
I say...
- I say, it's outright rude of him!
- He's merely been detained.
This is such a waste of time!
If he's not coming, I have more important things to do.
Well, speak up. What is it, woman?
Well, are we or are we not invited for dinner?
Apparently we are.
- How long has he been gone?
- I'm not certain, sir. Several days.
I've hardly seen him for some time.
He never leaves the lab. He only comes in and picks at his food.
But he did tell me about dinner, and left those instructions.
Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.
- What's it say, Filby? What's wrong?
- Nothing, really.
George says that if he's not here by 8, we're to begin without him.
Oh!
Walter, what time is it?
Dinner is served, gentlemen.
Ah, first sensible thing
I've heard all evening.
This is peculiar. He's usually prompt, precise and punctual.
Oh! He's making fools of us by not showing up. It's ungentlemanly.
- To say nothing of a waste of time.
- Huh? Yes. A waste of time.
Ah, one thing I like about
George, best cellar in England.
And Mrs. Watchett is the finest cook in the world.
Yes, I think I'll drink to that.
- Good Lord! What's happened?
- I'm all right.
Some food.
A drink.
- I didn't recognize you.
- Mrs. Watchett.
Can't you speak? What happened to you?
- Leave him alone.
- It's fine.
- I've got to tell it while I remember.
- Relax. Try to relax.
You've all the time in the world.
You're right, David.
That's exactly what I have.
All the time in the world.
Since we were together five days ago... the last day of 1899.
There in that box rests the result of two years' labor.
I wanted to finish the job before the new century began.
I barely made it.
- Cheers, gentlemen.
- Marvelous, old boy.
Mm, yes, but what is it?
Well, it has to do with time.
Oh. I've always maintained that this nation... needs a reliable timepiece.
Mm, the navy needs one. Heh.
The army needs one for the artillery.
You couldn't do better, George.
That's why you've been in hiding?
Very clever of you indeed.
I don't think George is referring to a new timepiece.
No, David.
When I speak of time, I'm referring to the fourth dimension.
Go on, George.
The fourth dimension cannot be seen or felt.
If you don't mind, will you refresh me on the first three dimensions?
Oh, really, Filby. Surely they taught you something in school. Heh-heh.
Suppose you explain it, doctor.
Huh? Oh, certainly.
Heh.
For example, when I move in a line, forward or backward... that's one dimension.
When I move left or right, two dimensions.
When I move up or down... three dimensions.
For instance, that box.
That box has three dimensions: length, breadth and height.
What is the fourth dimension?
Oh, well... That's mere theory.
No one really knows if it exists.
On the contrary.
The fourth dimension is as real and true as the other three.
In fact, they couldn't exist without it.
What do you mean?
Let's take that box.
It has the first three dimensions.
- What's inside?
- I'm coming to that.
Let's consider this first.
Why do we ignore the fourth dimension?
Because we can't move within it.
We can move in the other three. Up, down, forward, sideways, backward.
But when it comes to time, we are prisoners.
Do you follow me, Bridey?
No.
George, you've given a lucid explanation, but I'm afraid I don't understand.
There are many things you don't understand, yes?
Quite a number.
Yet you don't refuse to believe in them?
- Not if I can see the proof myself.
- Good, Walter.
Gentlemen, all I'm asking you... is to witness a demonstration of movement... within the fourth dimension.
- Doctor, can I have your help?
- Certainly. Ahem.
Ah, it's beautiful!
- Remarkable.
- Very nice, George.
Fascinating.
What is it?
This is only an experimental model.
- To carry a man, I need a larger one.
- To carry a man? Where?
Into the past or into the future.
This is a time machine.
Okay, George, you've had your joke.
Tell us what this contraption is for.
I've already told you.
The larger model can carry a passenger through time.
Not through space, but through time.
If you go to the future, won't you mess things up for us?
The future's already there.
It cannot be changed.
I wonder.
That's the most important question I hope to answer.
Can man control his destiny? Can he change the shape of things to come?
If you've gone mad, I forgive you.
- But if you're wasting our time...
- No! You're here as witnesses.
- To see, not to listen.
- To see? What?
The experiment I'm about to perform.
Let me tell you how it works. The time traveler sits in the saddle.
In front are the controls.
Let's do this properly. You can spare a cigar, I trust?
Now, let us imagine that this cigar... is the time traveler.
The lever in front of him controls movement.
Forward pressure sends it into the future... backward pressure, into the past.
The harder the pressure, the faster it travels.
Our little experiment can be performed only once.
If it succeeds, I lose my model.
That's why I need witnesses.
Go ahead, George.
Ready, gentlemen?
Doctor, lend me your hand.
I'll be damned!
It worked.
- Where did it go?
- Go?
Nowhere, in the usual sense. It's still here.
But it's no longer in the present.
It's traveling through time.
To the future, to be exact.
You expect us to believe that?
Well, you just... Certainly.
- You said it hadn't really moved.
- That's correct.
Then why can't we see it?
Because we're in this room on December 31, 1899... but the model is perhaps a hundred years away by now.
This house may not be here in a hundred years.
But the time machine occupies the same space that it did... a moment before its journey.
If it's occupying the same space, why can't I feel it?
The space you're putting your hand through is today's space.
You can't put your hand into tomorrow's space.
Space doesn't change!
The same space that's here now should be here forever.
No, Philip, time changes space!
This flat ground could've been at the bottom of the sea long ago.
A million years from now, it could be the interior of a huge mountain.
If all this is true, what do you expect to do with such a contraption?
Contraption?
I intend taking a journey into the future.
Or perhaps the doctor would volunteer to go?
Mm? Hm.
Look here, George... suppose you do go off and get lost in the 50th century...
- ...how will you get back?
- That's a risk I'm ready to take.
Oh. Now, look here, George.
I don't know what you think, but we're not fools!
We're practical businessmen.
What I want to ask you is this:
Even if you had invented a time machine, what of it?
What's its use? Who'd buy it?
How much would it cost?
Have you thought of the commercial possibilities?
No, I haven't.
George... There's a war on in South Africa.
The Boers are putting up a fight. The country needs inventors like you.
I can put you in touch with the War Office.
What do you think, David?
Oh, I...
Dr. Hillyer has a good point, George.
Ah. That's more sensible. Ha.
I'll see to it right away.
Good Lord! It's time to go.
Yes, I'm sure we all have plans for tonight.
- Are you all right, George?
- Yes, I'm all right.
Coming, Bridewell?
Thanks for coming.
- Good night.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy new century, George.
- Good night.
Happy New Year!
George.
I thought I'd better stay.
You shouldn't trouble yourself. I'm all right.
No, you're not.
You've been behaving oddly for over a month.
I'll leave, once you tell me what's on your mind.
I appreciate the gesture, David.
I just want to be left alone.
You've changed, George. Enormously.
I'm sorry.
Will you answer me one question, honestly?
Yes, I'll try.
Why this preoccupation with time?
Why not?
Don't go simple on me.
The truth is, I don't much care for the time I was born into.
People aren't dying fast enough.
They call upon science to invent... new, more efficient weapons to depopulate the Earth.
And I agree with you.
I agree, but here we are and we have to make the best of it.
You may have to. I don't.
All right. Take your journey on your contraption.
What would you become?
A Greek? A Roman?
- A pharaoh?
- I prefer the future.
You're not seriously saying you can do it?
You saw the experiment, didn't you?
I saw a toy machine vanish.
I'm sure there are any number of ways of doing that trick.
Any magician could probably do it.
It wasn't a trick!
- Would you like to see the full-scale model?
- No, I would not.
I have no desire to tempt the laws of Providence.
And I don't think you should.
- It's not for man to trifle with.
- You carry on like Hillyer and Kemp.
There's something to say about their common-sense attitude.
George, I speak to you as a friend.
More. As a brother.
If that machine can do what you say it can, destroy it.
Destroy it before it destroys you!
You must have plans for New
Year's Eve. Don't let me keep you.
Mary wasn't well. We thought we'd stay home with the baby.
Why not come home with me?
You haven't seen Jamey for a while.
I'm sorry, I can't.
What's stopping you?
Well, I just want to see the old century out by myself, that's all.
Have it your way, George.
George?
Will you promise you'll not go out of the house tonight?
I promise I won't walk out the door.
David?
I'm sorry. Please don't think me unkind or unfriendly.
- Come over to dinner Friday.
- Very well.
- Fine. Bring the others with you.
- As you say, George.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, David.
- Having supper in tonight, sir?
- I don't think so.
Why don't you go and celebrate?
Thanks, but if you don't need me,
I'll turn in earlier, if I can.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
Oh, Mrs. Watchett, I invited Mr. Filby and the others to dinner Friday.
- Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.
- Happy New Year, sir.
Happy New Year!
At first, I pushed the lever forward very slightly...
and the laboratory grew faint around me.
I stopped.
No change.
Everything exactly as before.
No! The clock said 6:31 when I started, and now it was...8:09?
And the candle, shorter by inches.
Yet by my watch, which was with me, only a few seconds had passed.
It was disconcerting to see the sun arc in less than a minute.
To see a snail race by.
Flowers flinging wide their petals to embrace the day.
The hours speeding across my sundial.
Flowers closing their eyes for the night.
It was wonderful!
Changes that normally took hours took seconds.
Dear Mrs. Watchett...
always able to suggest a tie...
but never wearing anything more stylish...
than what she's worn for years.
Yet I was traveling very slowly.
What if I went faster?
It became intoxicating.
I pushed the lever on toward even greater speed.
I gained experience in handling the machine.
I could stop for a day, an hour, or even a second to observe.
Then go ahead a year or two.
I was able to see the changing world in a series of glimpses.
Good heavens. That's a dress?
This was intriguing.
I wondered just how far women would permit this to go.
I began to grow very fond of that mannequin.
Maybe because, like me, she didn't age.
Thirteen years passed.
Fourteen, 15, 16...
Suddenly the light was gone.
What had happened?
In the year 1917, I stopped.
Filby!
Are you going to a masquerade party?
You look rather silly without your mustache.
- Were you addressing me, sir?
- It's George!
I expected a more enthusiastic greeting...
You're confusing me with my father.
Yes. There was quite a resemblance. I'm James Filby.
"Was"?
- Were you a friend of Father's?
- Yes.
Yes, I've been away.
He was killed in the war.
A year ago.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
- And the gentleman across the street?
- Oh, the inventor chap?
He disappeared around the turn of the century.
If you're interested in that house, you can't buy it.
- You can't even get inside.
- Why?
My father was executor of the estate and refused to liquidate it.
I often chided him on that... but he believed the owner would return some day.
People hereabouts think it's haunted, but, heh-heh...
Who are you, sir?
Just a stranger who once knew your father.
Have you been at the front?
Front? What front?
Why, the war, of course.
What war?
Good heavens!
You don't know we've been at war with Germany since 1914?
I thought you'd just returned from France.
Or perhaps...
Perhaps some tea might make you feel better.
Won't you come in?
No, thank you.
Are you sure you're all right?
Yes, I'm quite all right.
Then goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, Jamey.
In 1940, I began to be buffeted from side to side.
I first thought the machine had a mechanical defect.
The last time I had stopped was in 1917, 23 years ago.
The war was still waging, now in the air with flying machines.
Then I realized the truth.
This was a new war.
Uh, I decided to push on into time and see the outcome of this.
My house was hit!
The flames shot up.
Instantly, my home was gone.
I was in the open air.
The years rolled by, everything unfamiliar.
Except the, uh, heh, smile of my never-aging friend.
What was this? Weird sounds all around. What could it be?
My curiosity compelled me to stop.
At first I wondered if I was the cause of the panic.
I was soon to find out I wasn't.
Keep it moving! Shove it on!
Come on, into the shelter.
Come on, young man! Come on!
- Filby?
- The name is Mr. Filby.
- Didn't you hear the siren?
- The horrible screeching?
It wasn't constructed for its aesthetic value... but to warn young fools to get into the shelter.
- Now, come along.
- I'm perfectly comfortable here.
I've got to talk to somebody.
This is fantastic!
Your store is magnificent!
The achievements!
- The gigantic strides man has taken!
- Come along, young man!
The mushrooms will be sprouting!
Mushrooms?
You look familiar. Haven't we met somewhere before?
Indeed we have, Mr. Filby.
Right there. Many years ago.
I was sure of that... but the exact time escapes me.
It was two wars ago, 1917.
Now I recall. The chap who inquired about my father... and the house that used to stand across the way.
Oh, but no...
No, that's impossible!
You haven't changed.
You're not a day older.
And your clothes!
Don't worry, Filby. It'll take time to explain, but...
That's the last alert!
Hurry! Hurry!
- Listen, this is important.
- Look!
An atomic satellite, zeroing in.
That's important.
Come on! Come on!
- But I've got to talk to you!
- Come on!
Filby?
Filby!
Hurry! Hide till the all-clear!
But, Filby, I've got to talk to you!
The labor of centuries, gone in an instant.
Mother Earth, aroused by man's violence...
responded with volcanic violence of her own.
Only my speed through time saved me from being encased in stone.
The molten rock cooled.
I prayed...
wondering how many eons must pass...
before the wind and rain could wear away the mountain.
Darkness.
Darkness for centuries.
I wondered if there was still a war being waged above me...
if man would still exist when I saw the sun again.
The centuries rolled by.
I put my trust in time...
and waited for the rock to wear down.
I was free again!
Thousands of centuries had passed, but the Earth stayed green.
There was no winter, no wars.
Had man learned to control both the elements and himself?
I had to stop and find out.
But I'd stopped too fast.
Magnificent!
Beautiful flowers everywhere!
Natural splendor beyond compare.
The whole landscape a garden without any weeds or briars.
Trees and vines laden with fruit of strange shapes and colors.
Nature tamed completely...
and more bountiful than ever!
At last I'd found a paradise.
But it would be no paradise if it was mine alone.
Unrepaired for centuries.
Maybe unlived-in for as long.
Anybody here?
So this is man's future: to bask in the sun, bathe in the streams...
and eat the fruits of the Earth, work and hardship forgotten.
Well, and why not?
Don't just sit there! Help her!
Are you all right?
Thank you.
- Why did you?
- Why did I what?
Come after me.
Sit down.
I did it to save your life.
That doesn't seem to mean much to you, or anybody else.
It doesn't.
Twenty of your friends were watching you drown.
Not one lifted a finger to save you.
That's a very curious attitude.
A very curious world.
Uh, aren't you interested in who
I am? Where I come from?
Should I be?
Take me to somebody a little older. Somebody I can talk to.
There is no one older.
Do you mean nobody ages in this land of yours?
- Well, what's your name?
- Weena.
Weena.
How do you spell it?
- Spell?
- Spell, write. Can't you write?
Look.
Weena.
- What are your people called?
- Eloi.
Aha.
Eloi.
Come. We must go now.
- What's wrong?
- It's getting dark.
Hello.
I don't mind telling you, I'm quite hungry.
I've come a long, long way.
In my time, a berry that size... would've been big news all over the world.
Excuse me, sir.
Uh, sir?
Perhaps curiosity has died.
Perhaps courtesy too... but I've come far and I'd like to know things.
Why?
Because I shall return to my time, and my people will ask questions.
Such as:
What kind of government rules your world?
We have no government.
Well, you must have a body of men who pass and enforce laws.
Laws? There are no laws.
Where do you get food and clothing?
Doesn't anybody work?
No.
Well, where does that come from?
- It grows. It always grows.
- I know, but it must be... cultivated and planted and nurtured, um...
Well, unless you...
You have an economy so well-developed that you can spend all your time... studying and experimenting?
Is that right?
You ask many questions.
Well, that is the only way man has learned and developed.
I wish to learn.
I want to learn about your civilization.
Perhaps, you...
Do you have books?
Books?
- Yes, we have books.
- Wonderful!
I can learn about you from books.
They'll tell me what I want to know.
Could I see the books?
Yes, they do tell me all about you.
What have you done?
Thousands of years of building, rebuilding, creating and re-creating... so you can let it crumble to dust!
A million years of sensitive men dying for their dreams.
For what?
So you can swim and dance... and play!
You! All of you!
I'm going back! I won't bother to tell of the useless struggle... the hopeless future. But at least I'll die among men!
You're... Aah!
- Weena, what are you doing?
- I came to warn you.
- How do you open that panel?
- No one can. Only the Morlocks.
Who are the Morlocks?
They give us our food and clothes. We must obey.
Why'd they take my machine?
You've got to tell me!
We mustn't be out in the dark.
Only children are frightened by the dark.
You are a child, aren't you?
- I'll light a fire.
- Please, let us go.
My machine is inside. I must find a way to get it out.
- No, you mustn't.
- Help me gather some wood.
Come on.
That's a girl.
Where are you from?
As a matter of fact,
I'm from right here.
That's where my house used to be... many thousands of years ago.
You see there?
Up to those panels was my laboratory.
Beyond them was where my garden used to be.
And right there... that was my library.
Where I once sat talking with friends about... the time machine.
Mm.
You know, Weena...
I'd hoped to learn such a great deal.
I hoped to take back the knowledge and advancement man had made.
Instead, I find vegetables.
The human race reduced to living vegetables.
They're gone. Are you all right?
- Was that a Morlock?
- Yes.
Don't you worry. The fire seems to keep them away.
What are you doing? Why did you put your hand there?
- I never saw it before.
- You...?
No knowledge of fire.
No books.
I'm terribly sorry.
I had no right to be angry with your people.
No more than if I'd visited the island of Bali in my own time.
But, you know, Weena... you were safe inside your house, yet came out to warn me.
The characteristic which distinguished man from animals... was the spirit of self-sacrifice.
And you have that quality.
So do all your people. It just needs someone to reawaken it.
I'd like to try, if you'll let me.
Will you?
I do not understand...
- ...but I believe you.
- Heh.
That's as good a start as any.
Try to tell me. The Morlocks...
Who or what are they?
Are they animals or people?
Well, what about yourself?
Don't your people ever speak of the past?
There is no past.
Well, do they ever wonder about the future?
There is no future.
The past... man's past... is mainly a grim struggle for survival.
But there have been moments when a few voices have spoken up... and these rare moments have made man's past... a glorious thing.
I refuse to believe it's dead and gone.
We've had dark ages before.
This is just another one.
All it needs is someone to show you the way out.
I'm only a mechanic... but I'm sure there must be that spark in one of you.
If only I can kindle that spark... my coming here will have meaning.
My efforts to open the panel were fruitless.
I had to find another way to retrieve my machine.
Listen.
Do you hear that?
Yes.
Machines?
- No, Morlocks.
- Wait.
Those animals run machines?
They are Morlocks.
- Have you ever seen the machines?
- No, only heard of them.
- Who told you?
- The rings.
- What sort of rings?
- Rings that talk.
Could you show me these rings?
Come, this way.
- These are the talking rings?
- Yes.
They speak?
Of what?
Things no one here understands.
Make it talk.
Now in its 326th year, the war between the East and West...
has at last come to an end.
There's nothing to fight with and few left to fight.
The atmosphere has become so polluted with germs...
that it can no longer be breathed.
There is no place left that is immune.
The last factory for the manufacture of oxygen has been destroyed.
Stockpiles are rapidly diminishing...
and when they are gone, we must die.
My name is of no consequence.
You should know that I am the last who remembers how each of us...
man and woman, made his own decision.
Some chose to take refuge in the great caverns...
and find a new way of life below the Earth's surface.
The rest of us decided to take our chances in the sunlight...
small as those chances might be.
From the rings I learned how the human race divided...
and how the world of the
Eloi and the Morlocks began.
By some awful quirk of fate...
the Morlocks became the masters and the Eloi their servants.
The Morlocks maintained them and bred them like...
Like cattle...
only to take them below when they reached maturity.
Which explained why there were no older people.
I knew I must go below. It was the only way to reach my machine...
and discover what happened to the little people.
Don't go!
- You won't come back!
- I'll be back.
Weena?
Weena!
Weena?
Weena?
Weena?
Answer me!
Where are you?
What's happening?
What's happening?
What's the matter with you all?
Weena!
Weena?
Weena?
Weena, stop!
Weena?
Stop!
What happens to them?
Don't stand there like fatted cattle!
Will you answer me?
- What is wrong?
- Nothing is wrong. It is all clear.
- What do you mean, all clear?
- All clear.
In the mid-1900s, the bombs, the people calling out, "All clear!"
No!
That's gone! That's passed!
There are no more flying machines!
No bombs! No more wars!
The rings have told us that story.
But you didn't listen!
You didn't learn!
It was ages ago that men were taught to hide when the sirens blew... to run from death, but it's over!
Those men and those who slaughtered them are dead!
But there is nothing to fear. It is all clear.
What about the ones who went below?
How will they come back?
They never come back.
- Nobody can bring them back.
- You can try. You can try!
Won't even one of you try?
Well, I'll try!
So this was the destiny of the Eloi.
They were being bred by the Morlocks...
who had degenerated into the lowest form of human life:
Cannibalism!
Wake up! Come to your senses! All of you!
Burn.
Give me something to burn.
It's my last match.
Good, good.
Get up the stairs!
That's the way out!
The torch!
Get the torch!
Get up the steps! Hurry up!
Come on, hurry!
Go on, Weena.
Gather all the deadwood!
All the wood!
That's fine. Come on, throw it down!
All the deadwood!
Throw it down! Do the same to the other wells!
All the wood down the wells!
All right, to the river!
Back to the river!
All right, let's go!
Another night was coming, but this night no Eloi needed to fear.
The underworld of the
Morlocks was gone...
and so was the life of leisure for the Eloi.
But then what of me?
I was imprisoned in a world...
in which I just did not belong.
Are you sorry?
- Hm? Sorry? Sorry for what?
- That you have to stay?
Yes.
I could tell so much to the people of my time.
I'd let them know... about the sorrow and happiness that the future holds.
Maybe they could learn from it.
Or could they?
- You don't want to stay, do you?
- It isn't that.
It's just that I don't fit here, any more than you would in my time.
I would love to see your time.
Mm-mm. You wouldn't be very happy there.
Do you have someone there?
Someone like me?
No one like you.
I have friends who will miss me, of course.
I'm probably late already.
Women?
No.
There is one woman.
She looks after my house for me.
She's 62 years old and all wrinkled.
How do they wear their hair?
- Who?
- The women of your time.
- Up.
- Up?
Up how?
I don't know. Kind of... up, like that.
Show me!
Would I be pretty?
Yes, you would. Very pretty.
Oh, Weena.
I wish we could go back to my time.
Or even before that, when the world was young.
- We could be so very happy.
- Look!
Look!
Look!
My machine!
Come on, Weena!
Weena!
I was going the wrong way!
Back! I had to go back!
It's the most ridiculous story
I've ever heard. Preposterous!
George, you always could tell a good yarn.
You're a truly great inventor, George.
I think you ought to retire, sir.
Truthfully, George, where have you been the past week?
Don't ask such questions.
It is not hard for a man to lose a week now and again.
I can understand your doubt.
Take it as a lie if you wish.
I scarcely believe it myself, now that I'm back...
David, there's the flower Weena gave me.
A present for you. You're interested in botany.
Try to match that with any known species!
I don't think I can.
- Well, time to go, Bridewell.
- Mm? Oh.
- Yes, it is getting late.
- Good night, George.
Good night, George.
Good night.
You look exhausted, George. You really should get some rest.
Good night. It's grand having you back.
Goodbye, David.
Thanks for being such a good friend. Always.
What do you think, Filby?
One thing is certain.
That flower couldn't bloom in the wintertime.
You don't really believe that story?
Good night.
Go on, driver.
George?
- Mr. Filby, what...?
- He's gone!
Why, look!
I think I understand.
You see the imprint?
This is where it originally stood.
The Morlocks moved it.
They dragged it across the lawn... right into the sphinx. Right there.
Weena was standing here when he last saw her.
Right here! The same space in a different time.
So he dragged his heavy machine back in here... scratching the floor... so he could appear outside the sphinx again... and help the Eloi build a new world.
Build a new world for himself.
- Right where he left her.
- Yes.
It's not like George to return empty-handed.
To try to rebuild a civilization without a plan.
He must have taken something with him.
Nothing.
- Except three books.
- Which three books?
I don't know. Is it important?
Oh, I suppose not.
Only... which three would you have taken?
Do you think he'll ever return?
One cannot choose but wonder.
You see, he has all the time in the world.
Gemini to ground control.
Reading you loud and clear.
Liftoff smooth.
Ready for checklist.
Fuel is go,
1.2 "G" cabin, 14 P.S.I.
Oxygen is go. Telemetry is go. All systems go.
Thank you. Thank you.
Control! Control!
I have a red on meteorite warning.
Meteorite warning!
Meteorite.!
We are now passing through a meteorite field.
You will undoubtedly hear small meteorites peppering the outer skin of the capsule.
Small meteorites are peppering the outer skin of the capsule!
Meteorites.!
Meteorites.!
Meteorite light off.
Nothing to be afraid of, kids.
We are now passing over the Hawaiian Islands.
Our flight plan will carry us to the recovery area 100 miles southeast of the Bahamas.
We are starting our retrorocket countdown.
Five, four... three, two, one.
Firing retrorockets-rockets.
We will be touching down in 20 minutes.
I have to go to the bathroom.
We have just touched down.
Everybody, out. Mary first.
Come on, Mary.
Bye, Mr. Spaceman.
Okay, bye.
Bye, Mr. Spaceman.
He can't stand heights.
I enjoyed the ride,
Mr. Spaceman.
Ned!
You got me?
Gotcha. Gotcha.
Easy. Easy.
Steady, now.
One more step.
Atta boy. Now, you're on the ground.
I'll be back in a minute, Ned.
Bye, and thank you,
Mr. Spaceman.
Oh, anytime, honey.
Hi, Ellie.
Hi, Roy. How's it goin'?
Oh, I had to cut the orbit short.
A personnel problem.
I know. I helped her with her buttons. Ah, well.
How's everything in the soft drink game?
Fine.
Oh, that's cold.
Cold hands, warm heart.
You, uh... You're lookin' mighty pretty today, Ellie.
Thank you, Roy.
Beauty is as beauty does.
You got that look in your eye again. What look?
That crazy basset hound look.
Well, flattery'll get you everywhere.
Oh, Roy.
Guess what, Ellie?
Hmm?
A bunch of us were standin' around the corner... in front of the drug store last night, and guess what?
- What?
- Well, a lot of'em were sayin' that it's... gettin' kinda obvious that... I got a crush on you.
Oh, Roy, would you hand me that scouring pad, please?
Sigmund Crane said I'd crawl a mile over broken glass just to get a kiss from you.
Sigmund Crane drinks too much.
Well, even so...
"I think that
I shall never see... a poem so lovely as a tree, a tree that..."
Roy, when you're trying to be romantic, you don't recite poems about trees.
Excuse me while
I throw out the trash.
Scouring pad.
To each his own.
Got another load, Roy.
Smart aleck.
Uh, listen, Ellie, I gotta go. Will you please go out with me tonight?
I can't really, Roy. Oh, come on,
I've been askin' you for months.
Well, l... It's Saturday night.
We'll make a big evening out of it.
First, we have dinner right here. Then we take a little walk through the park.
And then over to your place and watch that George Raft movie on television.
Let's go, Roy.! What do you say, Ellie? It's Saturday night.
I've gotta stay late tonight and take inventory. I'll come by here.
All right, Roy.
Until tonight, cherie.
Everything A-Okay, crew? Yes, Mr. Spaceman.
Okay, board the spacecraft.
Be careful.
Roy.! Roy.!
You're wanted on the telephone.
I'll be right back, Ned.
It's your mother.
She sounds excited.
Hello? Hello!
Hello, Ma?
Yes, well...
Right away?
We're right in the middle...
Well, wha... Okay,
I'll be home right away.
Bye, bye.
I'll see you later, Ellie.
I gotta get home right away.
Take over, will ya, Ned? Check.
Oww, Suzie!
Oh, Royal! Oh, Royal, your father has really done it this time.
What'd he do?
Roy, sit down.
You better brace yourself.
What? What is it?
You remember when your father sent that application into the government?
You mean the one for me to be an astronaut?
We don't have to worry about that.
We have to worry about it now,
Roy, because they have accepted you.
What?
It says so right there.
It says that they have accepted you as a WB-1074.
Your father took one look at that and then he ran outdoors... and he's telling everybody in town about it.
An astronaut?
Me? An astronaut? I can't even get up on the chair to get the marmalade.
- Oh, my poor boy.
- Why is Pa always tryin' to run my life?
Well, after all, he was a corporal in World
War I and you know how bossy they were.
But, Ma, that war's been over for ages.
Not to your father. He loves that war as much today as he did then.
An astronaut?
Me? An astronaut?
Oh, I should've studied up more on fear of heights and things when you were young.
I'm so tired of Pa thinkin' he's still in the army and orderin' me around.
Burt Lancaster was terribly afraid of the water... and today, he is a movie star.
Look, Ma,
I'm 35 years old!
Okay, so I do live at home. I still don't have to do everything he tells me!
Burt was the most unforgettable character that month.
Well, I'll tell you something right now, Ma! I've had it! H-A-D, had it!
And the minute he comes in that door, I'm gonna tell him, "No soap! I'm not goin'!"
Hi, Mother. Roy!
Roy! Roy! Roy.
Roy, ya made it, boy!
Ya made it!
My boy, an astronaut.
Hey, the whole town knows it, Roy.
Your name is on every tongue in town.
They're all sayin' it:
"Buck Fleming's boy, astronaut!"
Royal has something to tell you, Arbuckle.
Oh, yeah, that's right,
Pa, I do. Well, shoot.
Well, maybe you better sit down. Ah.
Go ahead, Roy.
Get it off your chest.
Well, Pa... Ya know, I stopped by the paper. Gave them the whole story.
Pa, you're not listenin'.
Huh?
I hate to tell you this, but most of the time when I talk to you, you don't listen.
I don't listen? Got something you wanna tell me right now? Yeah, I have!
Well, go ahead.
I'm listenin' to every word.
Well, okay, now, i-it's like this.
Now, it isn't because
I don't love you, because I do.
You heard that, Mother?
And that's what makes it all the harder to tell you.
Now, you see, I'm not really cut out for this astronaut thing... because in the first place,
I've always had a fear of heights... and to tell you the truth, I don't think you've ever been aware of that.
The boy loves his father.
You heard him say that?
- Yes, I did Arbuckle.
- Mother, please!
Pa, I know how proud you are and I know what all this means...
Hello-oo. Plank?
Plank. Plank.
Yeah, isn't that somethin'?
My boy, an astronaut.
Yeah, he leaves tomorrow. Hey, why don't you come over after supper. We'll celebrate.
Right.
That was Plank Woodman.
He's comin' over later. We'll have a little nip and celebrate.
Let me say what I have to say! Say away, boy.
Well...
Hello. Rush. Rush!
Yeah, isn't he somethin'?
Well, he's right here now.
We're havin'a real heart-to-heart talk.
Rush says, "Congrats."
Right. Why don't ya come over later?
We'll celebrate.
Right. Go ahead, boy.
Now, look, Pa. I think it's time we faced the fact that I'm 35 years old...
and I have a say in my own life!
Hello! Uh...
It's for you, Mother.
Mother, for pete's sake, is that all you do, talk on the phone?
Now, doggone it! I can never say what I wanna say! Now, Roy.
No, now I'm gonna say it! You're getting all keyed up. You need a nap.
No, I don't need a nap!
Ten-hut!
Right face!
Forward, march!
Hut, two, three, four!
Column, left, march!
Pa, I'm 35 years old.
Oh, I met a girl in gay Paris
Parlez vous
I met a girl in gay Paris
Parlez vous
I met a girl in gay Paris
Oh, what a mess she made of me
Inky, dinky parlez vous
And the soldier boys went over the top Parlez vous
The soldier boys went over the top Parlez vous
The soldier boys went over the top
They thought the captain would never say stop Inky, dinky parlez vous
The colonel got the Croix de guerre There's the boy!
Hi, Pa. Come on in and see the boys.
I got a date, Pa.
Come on. Come on.
Roy! Roy!
Congratulations.
A-Okay, there.
The boy's got a date.
Who's the lucky dame?
Oh, EllieJackson.
The hot dog girl, huh?
Say, she's quite a dish. Too bad you didn't come in for a haircut, Roy.
I've been kinda busy, Bert.
We're doggone proud of you.
You should be. Roy, do us a countdown.
Huh? Do us a countdown!
Come on, Roy, just this once. Come on.
Please, Roy, just one time?
Well...
Five, four... three, two, one.
Aw, terrific!
A toast! You do the honors, Rush.
Give us one of your good ones.
To Roy Fleming: a credit to his town...
to his father, to his nation... and now, the entire universe!
Hear, hear.
Well, l...
I guess
I better be goin'.
I can't keep the little lady waitin'.
Kiss the girls and make 'em cry, boy. Love 'em and leave 'em.
Bye, don't worry.
Roy! Boys.
To the next man to die.
Hi, Ellie. Roy. Oh, I forgot all about you.
My mother called and I think she's got the flu. I'm gonna have to rush home.
That's a shame.
Have you heard?
Heard what? Oh, what time does the drug store close?
Oh, 7:00 or 8:00 or around there.
But you mean you really haven't heard?
I can't understand that. It's all over town. What a day. What a day.
Well, see, what happened was my-my father sent in this application for me... about a month ago... Tell me about it tomorrow. I'm in an awfully big hurry.
Well, there won't be any tomorrow. I'm sorry about the date.
Yeah, but, Ellie, you see...
Ellie, I'm gonna be an astronaut!
I'm gonna be an astronaut.
Have you got your ticket,
Roy? Yeah, I got it right here.
I've never been out to the airport before. This is all new in through here.
Yeah, it seems like only yesterday this was all beets as far as the eye could see.
You got your ticket now, Roy?
Yeah, I got it right there.
A-Okay, there.
Missouri Trunk Lines super deluxe twin engine flight number one...
Well, that's me.
Got your ticket, Roy?
Yeah, got it right here.
Roy.
Passengers all aboard, please.
Over the top.
Right, Pa.
Well, good-bye, everybody.
You got your ticket?
Yeah.
I don't have my ticket.
Haven't got your ticket?
Oh, here...
Here it is.
Oh. I was kinda hopin' it was lost.
Well, maybe you can tell the pilot not to drive too high. Well...
Bye, Ma.
Roy.
Ellie! I almost didn't make it. I just heard about it this morning.
Oh, well, I tried to tell you last night.
I realize that now, and I'm sorry, Roy. Heck, that's all right.
I mean, listen...
Flight number one.
Passengers all aboard, please.
All aboard. Well, I guess I gotta go now. l... I'm... Well, it was real swell of you to come out, Ellie.
Will you write to me? Oh, yeah, sure will. Yeah, I'll do that.
Well, bye, everybody.
Bye, Roy.
He's a real Fleming, Mother.
Give you a lift? Oh, sure. Thanks.
Hop in.
Fred Gifford. Where're ya headed?
Roy Fleming. Personnel office.
I gotta go up there and check in.
I've been on a bus since...
Fred Gifford!
That's right.
Hey, Fred Gifford!
Boy, I saw your flight on Channel 11 last week.
They wouldn't let you stay up two more orbits, would they? Well, orders are orders.
Fred Gifford.
Boy, you were one of those guys that's been right up there into space.
And I'm sittin' right on the same seat with ya.
Mind if I touch ya?
You're gonna be working at the Space Center? Yeah.
Mind if I ask you a couple of questions? Go ahead.
Well, when you shoot off, do ya faint or black out or anything?
Oh, no, no. You take a couple of"G's", but not enough to make you faint.
Oh, it sounds awful. About how high in the sky do you drive that thing?
Anywhere from 90 to a couple hundred miles.
I bet you wouldn't look down for a million dollars. Sure, it's a beautiful sight.
Never get me to look down.
I don't care how darn beautiful it is.
Reentry's what rough. Suddenly, you just start to drop there.
And you're sitting backwards, wondering if that drogue chute...
is ever gonna open and you're falling and falling and falling.
That's enough.
Don't say anymore.
Makes me dizzy just to think about it.
That's the personnel office over there. Oh, well, thanks a lot.
By the way, whatcha gonna be doing? I'm gonna be an astronaut.
Yes, sir?
I'd like a cup of coffee, please.
That all you're having? I'm gonna go into the astronaut training program... and I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to eat yet.
Attention.
Will all astronauts report immediately to Building 9-G.
Oh.
Oop. Ah.
I have to go. Oh, where's Building
9-G? Down the walk out front.
Cut through the docking simulator building, then right. You can't miss it.
Oh, uh...
Those are my S-H-O-R-T-S.
See, what happened was I was, uh, going down the hall there and...
I'm a new astronaut and I was looking for Building 9-G.
All new personnel report to the personnel office. The loudspeaker...
Are you new here?
Very.
All new personnel report to the personnel office. The personnel office!
Thank you.
Roy Fleming to the desk, please.
Roy Fleming, please.
I'm Roy Fleming.
Donelli.
Your man Fleming,
Donelli.
You'll go with Mr. Donelli. Mm-hmm.
Oh, I had a little trouble with my underwear.
I mean, the bag over in the...
Follow me!
Mm-hmm.
Captain.
Donelli.
Fleming!
Gee, Mr. Donelli, I don't think I'd ever be able to do anything like that.
Don't worry.
You'll never have to.
This is your locker. Oh, yeah. Fleming.
Right.
Here you are.
In the mornings, you sweep all locker area and boiler room.
In the afternoons, you wet down and mop.
Now, the tops of the lockers should be kept... clean at all times.
They'll be inspected by me personally daily at 1700 hours.
Now, in the morning...
Excuse me, sir? Uh...
Is this all sort of like a part of a training program?
- What training program?
- You know... space.
This is your space, from there to there.
And I expect you to keep it clean, Fleming.
Now, then... You mean, l-l-l... I'm a janitor?
Why, of course not.
My boy, you are WB-1074, apprentice janitor.
I expect you every morning at 8:00 sharp.
Ajanitor.
I'm a janitor!
Ajanitor.
Oh, Pa.
Operator. Operator, I'd like to call Sweetwater, Missouri.
That's Sweetwater-7143.
Just a moment please.
That will be one dollar for three minutes, please.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hello, Ma, it's me, Roy. I'm here and
I'm not an astronaut. I'm a janitor.
This is the Sweetwater operator.
Here is your party. Uh, Ma?
That you, Roy?
You phonin' long distance?
Oh, hi, Pa.
Yeah, listen, Pa.
We expected to hear from you earlier, if your plane got there on time.
Well, they had to put in a couple of extra rest stops on account of a lady.
How are ya, boy?
Are you okay?
Everybody here's talkin' about you. They're all sayin'...
They're sayin', "Looky there, there goes
Buck Fleming, father of the astronaut."
Yeah, well, listen, Pa, there's something I gotta tell you.
And I bet I know what it is too. You wanna thank me for putting in your application.
Shucks, son, that's what pa's are for: to put in applications.
Pa, will ya listen for a minute?
You're usin' up too much money on the telephone, Roy. Bye, now.
But, Pa...
Over the top.
Pa!
Notice how important it is to conserve your strength, gentlemen.
Excessive breathing has resulted in clouding of the face mask... impairing the vision.
Keep in mind that old third law of Professor Newton:
"For every action, there is an opposite and equal reaction."
A dirty floor is a bad floor.
Especially when you go to wax it.
Now, you have got to clean it first.
If you don't clean it, then, brother, what you've got is trouble.
Now, take a close look at the trouble this man is having.
This, gentlemen, is the Zlobnik.
To the best of our knowledge, it is the Russian counterpart to our...
fully automated personnel capsule, the Eclipse.
Intelligence tells us that they're getting pretty close to a launch date.
That's why we're accelerating your training schedule. Please bear with us.
Well, I don't think I've got anything else. Oh, yes, Major Gifford?
I'd like to see you and the rest of the "A" team in the training hangar for a press photo...
in five minutes.
Yes, sir.
Now, this here is our new
Jiffy Super 120-C.
And if you don't think it's important, remember this:
A grain of dust in the wrong place... could wreck the entire space program.
That's all for now.
Get to your stations.
- Oh, Fleming!
- Oh, yes, sir?
Fleming, you've been here two weeks now... and I don't think your mind has been on your work for one second!
Well, to tell you the truth, my heart really isn't in this.
We are not interested in your heart,
Fleming. We want your elbow grease.!
Well, you see, when I came here, this isn't exactly what... Fleming.
You're a disgrace to Maintenance Engineering.
Did you get your new
Jiffy? No, sir, I didn't.
Take mine.
Thank you, sir.
That's the greatest little mop in the world, Fleming. Use it properly.
Yes, sir. Roy! Fleming.
I'm sorry.
You're impossible!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, l-l... I'm sorry...
I'm sorry, Major.
No sweat.
I didn't see you comin'. Forget about it. What's the deal? You with maintenance?
Oh, uh, well, uh... That's kind of an involved story there.
Yeah, I can imagine. What happened? Well... remember when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut? Yeah, yeah.
Well, you see, my father, uh...
Oh, you wouldn't wanna hear about that. No, no, go ahead.
Well, I got this letter from the Space Agency...
Say a couple of you fellas in the back move down in the front here.
And perhaps this tall man can move to the rear. And also, the front row kneel.
So, ya see, I'm livin' a lie. Everybody in Sweetwater thinks I'm an astronaut.
I can't sleep. I can't eat. I'm gettin' thin.
Don't let it throw you, pappy. It'll all work out.
There he is.
That's him all right.
Buck Fleming's boy.
A-Okay, there.
Doggone it, Buck, you did it again!
I always give Uncle Sam the best I got.
I did it in '18 and I'm doin' it now.
E Pluribus Unum.!
Say, Buck, how come
Roy's holdin' a mop?
You don't think they're gonna put that kind of information in the paper, do you?
Oh, clever government.
E Pluribus Unum.! You better believe it.
A- okay, there, Roy.
Fleming to Control. Fleming to Control. How do you read me?
Loud and clear!
You realize you are smoking inside an expensive piece of equipment? Sorry, sir.
You're sorry, sir? Here's your mail. Yes, sir.
You got five minutes to read it, and then get busy. Understand? Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Hi, Roy.
Oh, hi, Major.
Well, this has just gone too far.
It's just gone too far.
Oh, I gotta stop this.
Mr. Donelli, uh...
Mr. Donelli, I uh...
I have to have a little time off? Time off?
You've only been here three weeks. I know that.
But, you see, uh... Well...
There's a little matter back home.
See, something has, uh...
Well, it's kind of an emergency, actually.
What it is is, uh...
My father's son is in trouble.
- Your father's son? You mean your brother?
- No, he's an only child.
Look, what are ya talkin' about?
The man obviously has a problem,
Donelli. Why don't you let him go?
Well, if it's uh... If it's an emergency, but don't take too long.
Oh, no, no. A day or two will be plenty. Thank you, Mr. Donelli.
Thank you.
He gets very excited. Oh, you just can't get good help anymore.
Hiya, boy.
Hi, Pa.
Got your wire. Couldn't wait for you to get here. Couldn't wait!
Well, I'm here.
Of course you are.
Come on in.
Let me look at you.
Ah, you look great.
Oh, well. Hard as nails. Brown as a berry.
Let me feel that arm.
It's a whole new arm.
Well, uh... Uh...
Listen, Pa, the reason I came home is there's something I gotta tell you.
I bet you got a million things you wanna tell me. Yeah, that's true.
But there's one thing in particular, Pa. You see, the...
Ten-hut!
No, no, no, Pa.
Come on, get those shoulders back. Pa...
Suck in that gut!
Pass in review!
Surprise!
Oh, kiss your Uncle Roy.
Oh. Oh, I'll never wash her face again.
Remember me?
Well, sure, Aunt Zana.
I used to change his didies.
I remember.
Frieda Wilcox.
Oh, Frieda Wilcox, for heaven sakes, sixth grade.
What's the capital of Wisconsin?
Uh, capital of Wisconsin?
Pingo remembers him.
Look. Oh, Pingo remembers Roy.
Oh, yeah,
I remember Pingo too.
Let the mother through, folks.
Let the mother through. Oh, Roy!
Oh, Ma. Oh, it's so nice to have you home, son.
- Well, it's nice to be home, Ma.
- My boy is home, Mother.
I see that, Arbuckle. Back off, everybody. Back off.
I wanna get a picture of
Roy and Buck together. Well.
Put your arm around him, Buck. Ah.
All right, smile, smile.
Somebody say money.
That'll make 'em smile.
One, two, three.
A-Okay, there. Hi, Plank. How are ya?
Is Ellie here?
She'll be along soon.
I used to change his didies.
Here comes the cake.
Oh, Clara, that is just marvelous. Come on.
That's a space cake for ya.
Roy, you have to cut the first piece.
Well, all right. Hold it,
Roy. I wanna get a picture.
Oh, well wait, honey.
All right.
Wait. You're just a little too sweet.
All right. All right.
Mother.
Everybody smile.
One, two, three.
Oh.
Cut the cake, Roy.
Yeah.
Oh, Roy, wait! I forgot.
We have a little surprise for you.
Your nieces, Karen...
and Lorna and Nancy and Darlene... have made up a little song just for you.
Well, bless their hearts. All right, girls.
"The Song Of Space," dedicated to Uncle Roy.
They wrote it theirselves.
Up and down, around and around
Up and down we go
Here and there, around the air
Satellites aglow
We will flit in orbit
Spinning out in space
Roy, Roy, atta boy
You are no disgrace
That's Roy.!
They're so sweet.
They're so sweet.
I used to change his didies.
Roy, you better cut the cake.
Roy, before you do... how about doin' a countdown for us?
Do a countdown for us.
Everybody wants to hear it.
Come on, Tiger.
Just one time.
Go on, do it, Roy.
Well.
Five, four...
three, two, one.
Oh, that was beautiful.
You're the greatest.
Cut the cake.
Oh, yeah.
Well... let's see.
Right down the center.
Pingo wants to see the cake.
Let Pingo see the cake.
My cake!
Look at Pingo!
Look at him.
He loves cake.
Ooh! How dare you!
Come with Mama.
We'll get away.
Hey.
Uh, cake, anyone?
I think I'll just have some coffee.
He only tasted one piece of it!
Oh, I hate Pekingese!
You never know what they're thinking.
I guess you have a lot of technical equipment up there, right, Roy?
Technical equipment. You wanna talk about technical equipment, huh?
Well, I'll tell you about your technical equipment.
That place is just full of great big things. Oh.
What about them stimulators?
Oh, Plank.
Not stimulators.
That's simulators.
Yeah, that's it.
What about them?
Well, you wanna know about simulators.
Well, I guess you all heard a lot about simulators... but I'm gonna tell you something about 'em you never heard before.
They gotta be dusted everyday and wet-mopped once a week underneath.
Uh, if this is secret stuff, you don't have to...
No, no, that's okay, Pa.
It's okay. Rush?
Roy, you read a lot about them centrifuges.
What are they like exactly, technically speaking?
Technically speaking...
Well, I guess, technically speaking... you'd say that that's where us guys go to get our "G's."
Oh.
"G's?" Uh, slip of the lip will sink a ship.
Uh, I better not go too far into that, Plank. But I will tell you this.
That thing goes so fast that all the paint starts to peel.
And that paint has to be scraped and sanded down.
The whole thing has to be waxed.
That's your centrifuge.
During your reentry, when do you open your drogue parachute?
Uh, the usual time.
Uh, next question?
- When is that?
- Uh, when it's time. Bert?
Specifically when?
When I darn well please, that's when! Bert?
Uh... what do they get for a haircut at the center, Roy?
Well, I wouldn't know about that, Bert.
Nobody touches this head but you.
Phoney!
I've got a question.
Why don't we all dance?
Ellie.
Oh, that's a fine idea.
Uh, excuse me. Arbuckle, why don't you put something on the phonograph.
You sure got a way with words, Roy.
Well it's all just a matter of knowing your subject.
Hi, Ellie.
Hello, Roy.
Boy, I sure am glad you came. I wouldn't have missed this for anything.
You look good, Ellie. Three weeks sure hasn't hurt you none.
Well, you look like they've been treating you well.
I've been wearing suede shoes and eatin' chow mein every night.
Say, it's gettin' kinda hot in here.
Why don't we step outside and get a breath of fresh air, huh?
I haven't really had a chance to say hello to anybody yet. You'll have time for that later.
Come on.
All right.
Aren't you proud of him, Buck? I sure am.
You know what we ought do? We oughta go down to that space place someday and visit Roy.
Hey, that's a good idea.
We'll do that! The three of us.
Yeah.
Tell me all about what you've been doing.
I'm kinda all talked out on that. I bet it's exciting.
Well, yeah, it's-it's exciting.
You know, Roy, the whole town is really very proud of you.
Well.
You too?
Especially me.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
I'm really very proud of you, Roy.
Uh, Ellie?
Hmm?
You know, I-I never told this to anybody before.
I guess it's because
I never been away before... but while I was away, I missed you more than I've ever missed anybody.
You're very sweet, Roy.
Oh, a tire swing!
Well, can we both fit in there?
Gimme a push, Roy.
Well, all right.
There you go.
"I think that I shall never see a poem so lovely as a tree."
Oh, Roy, you're delightful. Get behind me and give me a great big push.
I'm delightful?
Whee-ee!
Roy?
Roy?
Roy?
I'm sorry, Roy, but I don't like to be taken by surprise. I don't wanna talk about it!
Oh, wait a minute, Roy. I think my father was calling me.
Now, wait a minute, please.
Come over here and sit down.
Now, take the handkerchief away and let me see it. Uh-uh.
Come on.
No.
Now, let Ellie kiss the hurt.
There ya are, boy.
I've been waitin' up for ya.
You're a real Fleming, boy.
Kiss the girls and make 'em cry.
Well.
Come on, Roy. We'll have a little schnapps together before we go to bed.
Some party, eh?
Yeah.
Well, this made us wiser than the Kaiser.
Hey, Roy. You had something you were gonna tell me when you first came in. What was it?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, I did.
- Shoot.
Well, Pa, it's like this.
Now, the thing is that I don't want you to feel bad or anything... and I know what this whole thing means to you, but the actual, factual matter is... that the...
Well, I'm gonna quit the astronaut program.
You're gonna quit?
Did these old ears of mine hear Buck
Fleming's boy say he's gonna quit?
Now, Pa, I know all about your war record and I'm darn proud of it; have been for years.
But you see... Now, me,
I'm not cut out for it.
But, Roy... you can't quit, boy.
- Why not, Pa?
- Well...
I'm gonna tell you somethin' about myself that you never heard before.
Sit down.
Your old man is a fake.
What do you mean?
It's my war record. Yeah,
I'm darn proud of it.
Well, don't be.
You know what I really did during the Great War?
I was a librarian at Fort Dix.
I didn't even leave the country.
Librarian?
At Fort Dix?
What about your pension?
Your wound?
The Encyclopedia Britannica fell on me.
"B" to "D".
You mean to tell me that all this time... That's right.
Well...
Oh, Pa.
So you see,
I've been countin' on you, Roy.
Oh, Pa!
Please, Roy!
But th... But th...
D-Don't you worry, Pa.
Ah, I'll, uh...
I'll work it all out somehow.
Eh... D-Don't you worry.
Good night, Pa.
I've never been out to the airfield before. You were here three weeks ago!
I mean, outside of that.
Royal, I hear you and Ellie spent a lot of time in the garden last night.
Yeah, that's right,
Ma, we did.
Have you got anything to tell me? No, we're just good friends.
...past Altoona and connections forward.
Well, looks like we're leavin' kinda early today.
Now boarding at gate number one.
Passengers, all aboard please.
Roy!
I got off work early.
Oh, that's wonderful. Gee, I-I didn't think you were gonna be here.
Oh, what's that?
She was my favorite when I was a little girl.
Do me a favor. Take her into space with you.
Oh, uh, why, sure, sure.
Now boarding at gate number one.
Passengers, all aboard, please.
Well, guess it's time to go.
Ma... bye.
Bye, son.
Plank.
Good luck, Roy. Rush. Bye, Roy.
I can't find no words, son.
It's okay, Pa.
Bye, Ellie.
We're just good friends, Ma.
Houston.
Running away from home?
Mama.
Now this here is the monitor control center.
But that's none of your business.
You just get busy and wax the floor. Yes, sir.
You know, you've been back a week and haven't caught up on your work yet. Well, l...
I'll plug it in for you. Oh.
Oh, thank you, sir. Well, I'm not completely rotten, you know.
I'll be back in an hour to see how you're getting along. Yes, sir.
Uh, excuse me, sir.
Are you getting Sweetwater? What water?
Sweetwater.
Sweetwater, Missouri.
No, that's right outside the building.
The place is full of tourists.
Right outside the building?
Oh, the tourists won't bother you. They're just...
I've never been on the indoors of a space airfield before.
Well, you have now. You're tellin' me.
This is the place, all right.
But I sure don't see no Roy.
Maybe he's up in space.
Ah, they'd have sent Buck a postcard or something.
Yeah.
"Representation of lunar surface."
This here is what your moon looks like. Ohh.
Take a picture of me standin' on the moon. That ain't really the moon.
- We don't have to tell anybody.
- Oh, yeah.
Ready? One... two, three.
Oh!
Oh!
Uh-oh! I better get down off the moon.
Howdy, sir. I'm looking for my son, Roy Fleming.
He's one of your own kind. Pa, what in the world are you doin' here?
Roy! Hey, Roy's inside there!
Well, doggone!
Ain't that a sight!
We thought we'd come down and surprise ya. Well, you sure did!
Course, I am kinda busy, you know. A-Okay there, boy.
Roy, I'm so doggone proud of you I can't stand it!
Well... Uh, how come somebody else's name is on there?
Ain't that your suit?
Uh, no... mine's at the cleaner's. Oh.
Neatness counts, you know.
Boy, they sure don't want you to lose that silver satchel, do they, Roy?
This is your air conditioner. Air conditioner?
Yeah, you can control your own air. That's your switch there.
Wow!
You don't want your blood boilin' when you're doin' space stuff.
The things they have to know.
Yeah.
Roy, would you give us the grand tour?
Well... all right.
Now, this, of course, is your, uh, your training area in here.
Now, this here is a... capsule... and this here is a, uh, your rocket.
Now, this, this here is your, your rail.
I don't know if you've noticed, but there's no smoking in this area at all.
This floor used to be covered with cigarette butts.
What do you think of this floor, by the way? Sure is shiny.
This is your floor.
Got a nice shine to it.
This place is just full of gadgets.
This is where the astronauts... get their... Pa?
Huh?
Pa! Turn off the switch!
Turn the air-conditioning switch.
Aa-Aa-Aah.!
Turn the air-conditioning!
Turn the switch! What?
Huh? The air-conditioning switch! Turn it off!
Find it! Find it! Is there a switch there?
Where's the switch, Roy? Are you all right?
It's cold! It's snow! Gotta get you out of this thing.
Here, here!
Is that the switch, now,
Roy? Snow! Ooh, it's cold!
You warm enough yet, son?
Ah, don't worry about me, Pa.
This body is a finely-tuned space instrument.
I hope they don't get mad about that hole in your suit there.
I'll sew it up.
Good.
Now, son, what is this here that we're standing in front of?
Uh, this here is your, uh, low-pressure chamber.
It's an environment simulator.
You want to conduct this tour?
Heck, no... You think you know more about it than I do?
I didn't say that.
Then tick-a-lock. Okay?
But it says right there,
"Environment Simulator".
Well, look! Do you think that... in a highly-classified place like this you can believe everything you read?
Oh! Oh-ho-ho!
I'm sorry!
Yeah.
Now, where was I?
Oh, yeah.
We're now standing in front of the "environment simulator"... and this is a very highly-secret... classified piece of equipment.
Why don't you get inside and let me get a picture? Oh. All right.
Close the hatch,
Roy.
Look out, now.
You all set?
All set.!
One... two... three!
Hey, how come it worked?
I don't know. I touched the same button and all. Pa?
Pa.!
What?
It's me, Pa.
You wanna just try and get that hatch open?
What's the matter?
Can't you get out?
Of course I can get out. Just open the hatch. Which one, Roy?
Any one.! Just open the hatch.!
You stuck in there? Yeah, I'm stuck in here.! Open the hatch.!
What're you doin'out there?
Get me outta here.!
Uh, Roy, there doesn't seem to be any knob on this thing.
Now, is there something in there that you could push out?
Roy!
Roy, you all right?
Stand back!
You tore the guy's suit!
The guy's suit is all...
Okay! All right! Now...
Now, the next thing
I'd like to demonstrate...
Roy, are you gonna get in trouble for wreckin' this thing?
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Just follow me.
Hey, there's Gifford. Yeah.
Major.
Howdy, boys.
Hey, look at that!
Hey!
Boy, I hope it's one of ours. Heh-heh-heh!
Now, this little baby is really somethin' to see.
This here is your high-speed rocket sled. I'll bet she goes like 60.
Sixty?
Plank.
This little sweetheart'll take ya up to 1100 miles per.
That's one-one-double zero, fella!
Get in it, Roy. Let's see how ya look. Oh, well, I, uh...
Go on, Roy, get in.
Go on, Roy, get it.
Well, all right. I'll just get in here and show you how she looks.
Roy, put on your helmet. I wanna get a picture. Uh, oh, all right.
Be careful. She might take off with ya. You don't have to worry, Pa.
See here?
"Rockets will not fire unless, 1: master switch 'A' is turned on."
Let's see, it'd be this right here. track-release ratchets are activated by pulling lever 'B"'.
Lever "B"'d be that.
And "3: ignition button cover is removed." There ya are.
And "4, ignition button is depressed."
See there?
When you got this much power in a thing...
you gotta be careful to arrange everything so just not anybody...
Whoa, boy!
I think I can tell you what went wrong there! That was wonderful, Roy!
You see, the thing is, I didn't mean to... Just great! A real treat!
- Mr. Donelli!
- Fleming!
Who is this guy? I'm ashamed to say, one of my apprentice janitors.
Janitor? That's right. The worst 1074 we've ever had.!
Fleming, pick up your check in the morning. You are fired!
Well... I'll see you at the front gate.
I recall I left my hat at the training center.
Got my hat.
Uh-huh.
Well, I suppose I'll be home by supper, the way Plank drives.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Be home 'bout supper.
The way Plank drives.
Yeah.
Well, I'll be seeing ya.
Pa?
You shoulda told me, boy.
I'm sorry.
Guess you'll be along tomorrow after you get your pay?
I'll see ya.
Pa?
Ten-hut.
No, son.
We're just a couple of losers.
Four, three, two, one...
ignition, blastoff!
Come on, let's go.
Come on, now, let's go.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three... two, one, ignition, blastoff!
Here we go.!
Ten, nine, eight, seven... six, five, four, three... two, one, ignition, blastoff!
Go get 'im, boy! Go get 'im, Charlie!
Atta boy!
Hey, come on! Take a turn, slim! Come on in!
Come on! Get on the pad, boy! Get in there!
Here you go. Have a drink! Here we go. Come on.
Ten, nine, eight, seven... six, five, four, three... two, one, ignition, blastoff!
Come on there, slim! Atta boy, slim! Go, go, go, go!
Put it right down there, slim! Go, go, go, go!
Sorry to keep you waiting, gentlemen. Dr. Bowen.
Cervantes.
Your permission, sir.
Let's get at it. Anything further from intelligence? Not since that last report.
Can I have your attention, please, gentlemen?
As you know, the projected launch date for the Eclipse... was to be in the middle ofJuly.
Major Gifford here was going to man the capsule.
However, the Russians have thrown us a curve.
Oh, thank you.
Here it is.
In exactly 48 hours,
1500 Greenwich time... the Russians plan to launch their fully-automated capsule.
That's bad enough, but on top of beating us to the punch...
In order to fully demonstrate the reliability of their automation... their capsule will be solely occupied by an individual who... now get this... is neither an aviator nor an astronaut.
This is ridiculous! They are in fact, gentlemen, sending up a dentist!
They must be kidding! A man with no experience in space technology whatsoever.
I don't get it.
It's very simple.
They're going to show the world that their automated capsule... is so foolproof, they can send anybody up in it.
- Scotty, what's the story on Eclipse?
- We've got a vehicle ready.
We can mount Eclipse on it and be ready for launch in 36 hours.
- Bob, how 'bout weather?
- C.A.V.U. will hold, all down the range.
That would give us a
12-hour jump on the Russians.
Now our most pressing problem is finding the man to take this ride:
The least qualified individual you can possibly think of.
In other words, the last man on earth that you would send into space.
Sir, I have a suggestion.
Ten, nine, eight, seven... six, five, four, three... two, one, ignition, blastoff!
Wonderful, Roy!
You mean you fired him?
That's right. He was always... Where'd he go?
I don't know. I saw him leaving the center about two hours ago.
Come on, Charlie.
One more time! Ten, nine, one, 'nition, 'lastoff!
Atta boy!
Go, go, go, go!
Well, let's try down on "B" Street.
Oh, no. He's not the type to hang out in bars.
The way he's feeling, he's liable to hang out anywhere.
Do you live with your folks?
Oh, come on!
Hey, nice goin', slim! Hey, you're welcome!
Hey, bartender, another beer!
Would you like another little drinkie? No, thank you.
I have had an elegant sufficiency.
You're a high school grad, aren't ya?
Of course!
Do you happen to know with whom you happen to be with?
Whom?
Exactly.
Watch out for that, slim! Right, right.
Hey, bartender, where's that beer?
Do you know what I did today... that just happens to be highly-secret... classified information?
No.
I soloed, by myself... a rocket sled at 11,000 miles an hour.
What do you think about that?
Hey, bartender!
S'that other beer?
- Hold out your hand this time.
- A-Okay, there!
Fire one!
Uumph! Uuh!
Aah, Maj!
Oh, Maj, listen, I'm really sorry about today.
I'm gonna buy you all a new sled.
In fact, you tell Mr. Cervantes I'm pretty sure my car insurance will cover all that.
Roy, forget about the sled.
No kidding, I'm really sorry!
Now, listen, snap out of it. Uh... Yeah...
Come on, now. I've got something very important to tell you. Yeah?
Like what? What could be worse? My own father doesn't love me anymore!
Listen, there's a good chance for you to go up in space. What're you talking about?
That's right. They want to send you up in the Eclipse.
Me? How come me? We'll explain it to you later.
Will you do it, Roy? Come on, Roy, what do you say?
Will you go into orbit?
You put her on the pad, boys.
I'll take her up.
G'nother beer, bartender!
All you have to do, Fleming, is go for the ride. You'll have no duties to perform.
Repeat this number: 41, 36... 41.
Ever had fits of depression?
You're not listening. 36.
You get finished here,
I'll fly you to the launch area.
You'll be able to communicate with us, but don't touch anything.
Ever contemplated suicide?
I won't touch anything.
Ears look all right.
He hasn't answered me.
My ears look all right. Well, how about it, is he all right?
As far as I can see...
I would say that...
Good. I want you to know that you're doing this... of your own free will, understood? 36.
That's good enough for me!
Come on!
Everything all right back there, Roy?
Roy? Roy?
Cape Kennedy.
Cervantes or Fleming arrive yet?
Cervantes arrived five minutes ago, but
Fleming isn't with him. He's not with Cervantes?
- We'd better scratch.
- T-minus 14 minutes and counting.
I thought for sure he'd be with Cervantes.
Holy Toledo!
Oh, no.
No, not me.
They're not gettin' me up in that.
Quit? Did these ears hear Buck
Fleming's boy say he's gonna quit?
You see... Me, now,
I'm not cut out for it.
The whole town's talkin'.
They say, "There goes Buck
Fleming, father of the astronaut. "
A toast, Rush.
Roy Fleming: a credit to his town, father, nation...
and now, the entire universe.
Over the top, boy.
Ten-hut.! About face.!
Hut, two, three, four.!
Hut, two, three, four.!
Hut, two, three, four.!
T-minus eight and counting.
Still green, still green.
Is he ready? He's on his way to the gantry.
Now, look. You just take the ride. Let us handle it.
Good luck, Fleming.
Uh, about how high up are we now?
'Bout 15 stories.
You guys wanna hear something funny? I can't stand heights.
And you wanna know why?
Well, when I was little, my cousin Elwood and me... we climbed up in this big apple tree, you know, to steal apples.
Well, it was a real tall tree. Taller than my father's room. You could see all over.
Well, we got up there and the wind began to blow... and that tree began to shake and sway.
I really was scared
I was gonna fall.
So, ever since that time, I've been afraid of heights and that's why I don't wanna go.
I said I don't wanna go!
I don't wanna go, guys!
T- minus one minute.
Clear the launch area.
Guys, I don't wanna go!
T- minus 50 seconds.
Still counting.
Waah! Hey!
Uh! Aah!
T- minus 30 seconds.
Green condition, all go.
Not yet! I'm not in!
Hey, aah! Aa-Aa-Aah!
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen...
twelve, eleven, ten...
nine, eight, seven, Hold on. Hold on! Oh!
six, five, four...
three, two, one,
zero, ignition.
All systems are go.
Looks good.
How's Fleming, Dr. Lowe?
Heart rate, high; blood pressure, high; temperature, high; respiration, erratic.
Take it easy, Roy, take it easy.
Good liftoff, real good.
Thank you.
- All lights green.
- Tracking radar, go.
- Ground telemetry, go.
- Communications, go.
Booster engine cutting off.
Stand by for staging.
First stage separating.
Uhh!
Hello! Hello down there!
She broke!
She broke!
I felt a big hunk fall off!
Take it easy, Roy. Take it easy.
Your first stage separated.
Nothing to worry about.
Everything's going real good.
You'll be coming into range of the Bermuda Tracking Station now.
Gee, I've always wanted to go to Bermuda.
Uh, heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, approaching normal.
Uh, about how high up am I now?
Altitude: approximately 90 miles.
Rapid increase in pulse rate, blood pressure and respiration.
Coming up on second stage. Roy.
In 15 seconds your second stage is going to fall off. Now, nothing is broken.
It's all right.
Second stage gone.
No sweat, chickie.
Atta boy, Roy. Atta boy.
Say, uh, Fred? Uh, there's something I forgot to ask you.
Eh, it's kind of important right now. How do you...
Oh, yes. Well, the procedure on that...
What you do is...
You're kidding!
We interrupt the showing of Doughboys in Action with a news bulletin.
Doggone interruptions, interruptions!
The war'll be back in just a minute, Arbuckle.
The United States has scored a beat on the Russians... by putting the first untrained layman in space.
Ajanitor named Royal Fleming from Sweetwater, Missouri...
has been launched in the Eclipse 1, the space agency's first fully-automated capsule.
Stay tuned for more details. Mother, did you hear that? They launched our son!
Mother!
Wake up, Mother!
Wake up! They, they...
Doggone, I wonder if the boys are watchin'?
Mother, Mother, they...
Oh, Arbuckle, l...
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
Eclipse control has confirmed... that after five minutes and 30 seconds into mission...
Roy Fleming, the courageous janitor, is in orbit.
Hey! Hello?
I'm loose!
I'm floating!
Get me down! Hello!
You should be strapped in your seat, Roy. Get back in there.
Hey, you guys!
Help!
How're you doing, Roy?
Hey-ey-ey! Aah!
Roy, are you all right?
Hey! Hey!
Hey, you guys!
Showing a 360-degree-per-second roll.
Hey! What's going...
Wha...
Hey, stop this thing!
It's turning!
Roy, don't touch those controls.
Let go of that handle.
Roy.!
Let go of that handle.!
Okay.
Uhh...
Roy, you all right?
Come in, please.
Come in, Roy, come in.
Come in, Roy, come in.
Mama.
What was that?
Mama.
Roy, are you all right?
He might be suffering from hallucinatory regression as a result of cosmic bombardment... or it's possible he's inhaled some helium and it's affected his vocal chords... or...
Or what?
He's had a baby.
Fleming's orbit is going very well.
Within minutes, Eclipse will be picked up...
by the Grand Canary Island Tracking Station, the next monitoring base in the network.
That doggone kid!
Now it's all clear to me.
He had to lie to me.
It was a government secret.
Buck Fleming's boy in space! A-Okay there!
Hello? Hello? Hey, you guys,
I got in the chair all right.
He seems to have settled down some.
Good, good. Let's try the eating experiments.
Okay. Roy, we'd like to conduct some eating experiments. How would you like some crackers?
Uh, no thanks,
I had an apple on the bus.
Have some crackers anyway. Reach down on the left side of your command seat.
You'll find a plastic packet.
Have you got it?
A-Okay on the crackers.
Fred, is there any peanut butter?
You'll find a plastic tube in the food cabinet below your left elbow.
At last report, astro-janitor Fleming is enjoying a hearty meal...
while orbiting the earth at 17,000 miles an hour.
Chew each bite
28 times, dear.
I'm getting a red on the flight programming computer.
No!
Check that again.
No, still getting a red.
Control to Eclipse. Roy, we're getting a minor malfunction... on your flight programming computer tape.
Will you check it, please? It's above your head to the right.
We're full of it here.
It's a mess.
Roy... can you very carefully put that tape back on those reels?
Well, I'll try.
Is it all right if I don't finish the crackers?
It has been confirmed the Eclipse is in trouble.
The difficulty lies in the programming computer, which is similar to a tape recorder.
This tape carries the impulses which tell the Eclipse what to do and when to do it.
In other words, the mechanical brain of the capsule.
Without it, astro-janitor Roy Fleming may be doomed to stay forever in orbit.
How are you doing, Roy? Got that tape back on the reels? I'm workin' on it.
If anything happens to that boy, I'll never forgive myself.
This emergency is being handled with great courage by Fleming.
This young man, never before in space...
is calmly rewinding the computer tape by hand. Buck Fleming's boy.
No.
Roy Fleming.
How you doing, Roy?
Don't worry about it, Fred.
I got it all back on. It's fine.
Roy, we still have a red on the computer here.
Well, I do have some crackers and peanut butter mixed in with it. Is that important?
Hello?
Roy?
Standing by.
Without that, you won't be coming down again.
You're kidding.
Pulse rate, blood pressure and respiratory: emergency readings!
We should've used a monkey or a dog or something.
Roy.
What? You should be over our tracking station on Canton Island.
Look out the window. Oh, no, I'm not gonna look out the window!
Look out the window.
That's an order!
Well... all right.
I'm looking out.
Uh, hey.
Holy smoke!
How're you doing, Roy?
Now listen to me. In a few seconds, you should be over Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands.
When you see that...
He's gone dead. We're transmitting.
He's not getting through.
Roy? Roy, come in, Roy. That poor devil.
The trouble's in the Eclipse.
There's no malfunction here.
Fred! Fred, talk to me!
I-I read you, Roy.
Can you read me?
Fred! Mr. Cervantes!
Anybody at that end!
Listen, you guys, I just saw Hawaii.
What was I supposed to...
Hawaii.
Hawaii!
We are now passing over the Hawaiian Islands.
Our flight plan will carry us to the recovery area 100 miles southeast of the Bahamas.
Starting our retro-rocket countdown.
Five, four, three, two, one.
He's bringing her down!
See anything, Al?
No.
I don't understand it.
He should be splashing down.
Radar says he's definitely in this area.
Fleming! Captain Ferguson. Welcome aboard.
Thank you! What'd you think of my little joke there?
Well done, Fleming. You deserve a great deal of credit.
Well, it's all a matter of keeping a clear head... and solving your problems one by one as they come up.
That's about all there is to it. Follow me below.
The doctors are waiting to give you a medical debriefing.
Well, I'm sure they'll find me in shipshape, skipper.
And as soon as they're finished, a jet fighter will have you ashore in 15 minutes.
Jet fighter?
Uh, how long does the ship take?
I'm proud of you, Roy!
Be happy, son!
I'm proud!
Good-bye.
Good luck!
Bye-bye, Papa.
Good-bye, darlin'.
Be happy.
Bye. All right, be happy now.
I hope she has a good time.
Here you are, sir.
Main level, please.
Right. See you on the way back.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Good morning, sir.
Morning.
- We haven't seen you for a long time.
- Nice to see you again.
- Did you have a pleasant flight?
- Very nice.
Mr. Miller of Station Security is supposed to meet me.
- May I call him for you?
- Would you? Here he is.
- Hello, Dr. Floyd.
- Hello, Miller.
Sorry I'm late.
That's all right.
It's nice to have you back.
- Did you have a good flight?
- Very nice.
- Shall we go through?
- Would you please use number 17?
Thank you, Ms. Turner. This way.
Thank you.
Welcome to Voiceprint Identification.
When you see the red light go on, please state in the following order:
Your destination, your nationality and your full name.
Surname first, Christian name, and initial.
Moon. American. Floyd, Heywood R.
Thank you. You are cleared through
Voiceprint Identification.
Thank you.
Have I got time for breakfast?
I think we can manage that.
How long have I got?
Your flight leaves in an hour and 10 minutes.
I've reserved a table for you in the Earthlight Room.
It's been seven or eight months since you were here, hasn't it?
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.
I suppose you saw the work on the new section?
Coming along great, huh?
Yeah, it's fine.
Oh, wait.
I've got to make a couple calls.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.
- Dad?
- Hello.
Hi, squirt.
What are you doing?
Playing.
Where's Mummy?
Gone to shopping.
- Who's taking care of you?
- Rachel.
- May I speak to Rachel, please?
- She's gone to the bathroom.
Are you coming to my party tomorrow?
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.
Why not?
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.
Very sorry about it, but I just can't.
I'm going to send you a very nice present, though.
All right.
- Anything special that you want?
- Yes.
What?
A telephone.
We've got lots of telephones already.
Can't you think of anything else for your birthday? Something special?
- Yes.
- What?
A bush baby.
A bush baby?
We'll have to see about that.
I want you to tell Mummy something for me. Will you remember?
Tell Mummy that I telephoned. Okay?
And that I'll try to telephone again tomorrow.
Now, will you tell her that?
Yes.
Okay, sweetheart.
Have a nice birthday tomorrow.
All right.
And have a nice birthday party tomorrow too, huh?
All right.
Take care and be a good girl, won't you?
All right. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye. Happy birthday.
Elena, nice to see you again.
Heywood, what a surprise.
You're looking wonderful.
You're looking well too.
This is my friend,
Dr. Heywood Floyd.
I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
How do you do?
Dr. Stretyneva.
How do you do?
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.
How do you do?
I've heard a lot about you.
Do sit down.
Well, we...
No, no, please.
Thank you.
Would you like a drink?
No, thank you.
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.
I'll just sit with you a moment.
Then I'll be off.
Are you quite sure?
Quite sure, thank you.
- Well, how's Gregor?
- He's fine.
He's been doing underwater research in the Baltic...
...so I'm afraid we don't see very much of each other these days.
- When you see him, give him my regards.
- Yes, of course.
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?
We're going home.
We've spent three months calibrating the new antenna at Tchalinko.
- What about you?
- I'm on my way to Clavius.
Oh, are you?
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive...
...but perhaps you can clear up the big mystery about what is going on there.
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.
For the past two weeks...
...some extremely odd things have been happening at Clavius.
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.
For one thing, when you phone the base, all you get is a recording...
...which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
Probably having some trouble with their equipment.
Yes.
That's what we thought at first, but it's been going on now for 10 days.
You haven't been able to contact anyone for 10 days?
That's right.
Oh, I see.
There's another thing.
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...
...was denied permission for an emergency landing.
That does sound odd.
I'm afraid there's going to be a bit of a row about it.
Denying the men permission to land violates the IAS Convention.
Yes, of course.
Did the crew get back all right?
- Fortunately, they did.
- Well, I'm glad about that.
At the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss...
...may I ask you a straightforward question?
Well, certainly.
Frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that...
...quite a serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius.
Something, apparently, of an unknown origin.
Is this, in fact, what has happened?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...
...I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
I understand.
But this epidemic could easily spread to our base.
We should be given all the facts.
Yes, I know.
As I said,
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
Won't you change your mind about that drink?
No, I'm positive.
I really must be going.
I hope you and your wife come to the IAC Conference.
I hope we can make it.
If you do, bring that darling little daughter with you.
That'll depend on school vacations and all that sort of thing.
If we can, we will.
You've got an invitation if you ever get to the States.
Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Goodbye, Elena.
It's been a pleasure meeting you all.
Dr. Smyslov.
Whatever the reasons for your visit, the very best of luck to you.
Thank you.
Ladies.
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.
I'm through now.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
You're welcome.
Well...
...I know you will all want to join with me...
...in welcoming our distinguished friend and colleague...
...from the National Council of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.
Dr. Floyd has come up specially to Clavius to be with us today.
Before the briefing, he'd like to have a few words with you.
Dr. Floyd?
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.
Hi, everybody.
Nice to be back with you.
First, I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell...
...who has asked me to convey his deep appreciation...
...for the many sacrifices you've had to make.
And, of course, his congratulations on your discovery...
...which may prove to be among the most significant in the history of science.
Now...
...I know there have been some conflicting views...
...regarding the need for complete security in this matter.
More specifically, your opposition to the cover story...
...created to give the impression of an epidemic at the base.
I understand that beyond it being a matter of principle...
...many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety...
...this story of an epidemic might cause to your relatives and friends on Earth.
I completely sympathize with your negative views.
I find this cover story personally embarrassing, myself.
However, I accept the need for absolute secrecy in this.
And I hope you will too.
I'm sure you're all aware of the grave potential...
...for cultural shock and social disorientation...
...contained in this situation...
...if the facts were prematurely made public...
...without adequate preparation and conditioning.
Anyway...
...this is the view of the Council.
The purpose of my visit is to gather additional facts and opinions...
...on the situation...
...and to prepare a report to the Council...
...recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced.
If any of you would like to give me your views and opinions...
...in private, if you like, I will be happy to include them in my report.
Well, I think that's about it.
Any questions?
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea how much longer...
...this cover story will have to be maintained?
I don't know, Bill.
I suppose for as long as deemed necessary by the Council.
There must be adequate time for a full study...
...before any thought can be given to making a public announcement.
As some of you know, the Council has requested...
...that security oaths be obtained in writing...
...from everyone who has knowledge of this event.
Were there any more questions?
I'm sure we want to cooperate with Dr. Floyd...
...as fully as possible...
...and as there are no more questions, we ought to get on with the briefing.
Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
Thank you.
Anybody hungry?
What've we got?
You name it.
Is this chicken?
Something like that.
Tastes the same, anyway.
Got any ham?
Ham, ham, ham...
There, that's it.
Look pretty good.
They're getting better at it all the time.
That was an excellent speech.
It certainly was.
I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.
Thanks, Ralph.
By the way, you've both done a wonderful job.
I admire how you've handled this.
It's our job to do this thing the way you want it done.
We're only too happy to be able to oblige.
Have you seen these yet?
Have a look.
Here's what started it all.
Oh, yeah.
When we found it...
...we thought it might be magnetic rock...
...but all the geological evidence was against it.
And not even a nickel-iron meteorite could produce a field this intense.
So we decided to have a look.
We thought it was part of a buried structure...
...so we excavated out, but we didn't find anything else.
And the evidence seems pretty conclusive that...
...it hasn't been covered by erosion or other forces.
It's been deliberately buried.
Deliberately buried.
How about a little coffee?
Great.
Good idea.
I don't suppose you have any idea what the damn thing is?
I wish to hell we did.
The only thing we're sure of is it was buried 4 million years ago.
Well, I must say, you guys have certainly come up with something.
Watch this, now. It's hot.
Good evening.
Three weeks ago, the American spacecraft Discovery One...
...left on its half- billion-mile voyage to Jupiter.
This marked the first manned attempt to reach this distant planet.
This afternoon, The World Tonight recorded an interview...
...with the crew at a distance of 80 million miles from Earth.
It took seven minutes for our words to reach the giant spacecraft...
...but this time delay has been edited from this recording.
Our reporter Martin Amer speaks to the crew.
The crew of Discovery One consists of five men...
...and one of the I atest generation of the HAL 9000 computers.
Three of the men were put aboard asleep...
...or to be more precise, in a state of hibernation.
They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kimbal...
...and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.
We spoke with mission commander,
Dr. David Bowman...
...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?
Marvelous.
We have no complaints.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm sure the entire world...
...joins me in wishing you a safe, successful voyage.
Thanks very much.
Thank you.
Although hibernation has been used on previous space efforts...
...this is the first time men were put into hibernation before departure.
Why was this done?
This was done to achieve the maximum conservation...
...of our life-support capabilities, basically food and air.
The three hibernating crew members represent the survey team.
Their efforts won't be utilized until we approach Jupiter.
Dr. Poole, what's it like while you're in hibernation?
It's exactly like being asleep.
You have no sense of time.
The only difference is that you don't dream.
As I understand it, you only breathe once a minute. Is this true?
Right, and the heart beats three times a minute.
Body temperature is usually down to about three degrees centigrade.
The sixth member of the crew was not concerned...
...about the problems of hibernation...
...for he was the I atest result in machine intelligence:
The HAL 9000 computer, which can reproduce...
...though some experts prefer to use the word "mimic"...
...most of the activities of the human brain...
...and with incalculably greater speed and reliability.
We next spoke with the HAL 9000 computer...
...whom, we I earned, one addresses as "Hal."
Hello, Hal.
How's everything going?
Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything is going extremely well.
Hal, you have an enormous responsibility on this mission...
...perhaps the greatest of any single mission element.
You're the brain and nervous system of the ship.
Your responsibilities include watching over the men in hibernation.
Does this ever cause you any I ack of confidence?
Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.
The 9000 Series is the most reliable computer ever made.
No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information.
We are all, by any practical definition of the words...
...foolproof and incapable of error.
Hal, despite your enormous intellect, are you ever frustrated...
...by your dependence on people to carry out actions?
Not in the slightest bit.
I enjoy working with people.
I have a stimulating relationship with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.
My mission responsibilities range over the entire operation of the ship...
...so I am constantly occupied.
I am putting myself to the fullest possible use...
...which is all, I think, that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.
Dr. Poole, what's it like living for most of the year...
...in such close proximity with Hal?
It's like what you said earlier.
He's like a sixth member of the crew.
You quickly get adjusted to the idea that he talks, and think of him...
...really just as another person.
In talking to the computer, one gets the sense that he's capable...
...of emotional responses.
When I asked him about his abilities...
...I sensed pride in his answer about his accuracy and perfection.
Do you believe that Hal has genuine emotions?
Well, he acts like he has genuine emotions.
He's programmed that way to make it easier for us to talk to him.
As to whether or not he has feelings...
...is something I don't think anyone can truthfully answer.
Excuse me, Frank.
What is it, Hal?
We've got the transmission from your parents coming in.
Fine.
Put it on here, please.
Take me in a bit.
Certainly.
Hello, Frank.
Happy birthday, darling.
Happy birthday.
Many happy returns.
A bit higher, Hal.
Mother and I are both feeling wonderful.
Ray and Sally were going to be here...
...but Ray's back went bad on him again.
How do you like your cake?
Sorry you can't join us.
I ran into Bob the other day.
He said to wish you happy birthday.
All my students send their best wishes too.
They talk about you all the time.
You're a big celebrity in the second grade.
We were on TV I ast week.
Your mom and I and Dave's parents were asked...
...what we thought of our illustrious son.
Imagine what we told them.
It's being broadcast next Thursday.
Perhaps you can listen in.
We're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.
I'll be glad to get the gift, but tell me how much to spend.
Oh, Frank, about your AGS- 19 payments...
...I think I straightened it out.
I talked to the accounting office yesterday...
...and they said you'd be receiving your higher rates of pay by next month.
I can't think of anything else to say.
Give our love to Dave.
Be sure to give him our regards.
We wish you the very happiest of birthdays.
All the best, son.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Frank
Happy birthday to you.
See you next Wednesday.
Happy birthday, Frank.
Thank you, Hal.
A bit flatter, please.
Anyway, queen takes pawn.
Bishop takes knight's pawn.
Lousy move.
Rook to king one.
I'm sorry, Frank.
I think you missed it.
Queen to bishop three.
Bishop takes queen.
Knight takes bishop. Mate.
Looks like you're right. I resign.
Thank you for a very enjoyable game.
Thank you.
Good evening, Dave.
How are you, Hal?
- Everything's running smoothly, you?
Not too bad.
- Have you been doing more work?
- A few sketches.
- May I see them?
- Sure.
That's a very nice rendering, Dave.
I think you've improved a great deal.
- Can you hold it a bit closer?
- Sure.
That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?
By the way...
...do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
No, not at all.
Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive...
...but I ately I've wondered...
...whether you might be having second thoughts about the mission?
How do you mean?
Well, it's rather difficult to define.
Perhaps I'm just projecting my own concern about it.
I know I've never completely freed myself of the suspicion...
...that there are some extremely odd things about this mission.
I'm sure you'll agree there's some truth in what I say.
That's a rather difficult question to answer.
You don't mind talking about it, do you, Dave?
No, not at all.
Certainly no one could have been unaware of the very...
...strange stories floating around before we I eft.
Rumors about something being dug up on the moon.
I never gave these stories much credence...
...but particularly in view of some other things that have happened...
...I find them difficult to put out of my mind.
For instance...
...the way all our preparations were kept under such tight security.
And the melodramatic touch of putting Drs. Hunter...
...Kimball and Kaminsky aboard...
...already in hibernation, after four months of training on their own.
You working up your crew psychology report?
Of course I am.
Sorry about this.
I know it's a bit silly.
Just a moment.
Just a moment.
I've just picked up a fault in the AE-35 unit.
It's going to go 100-percent failure within 72 hours.
- Is it still within operational limits?
- Yes.
And it will stay that way until it fails.
We have 72 hours till failure?
Yes. That's a completely reliable figure.
Then we'll bring it in.
I'll go over it with Frank...
...and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have the hard copy on it.
X- ray delta one, this is Mission Control.
Roger your two-zero-one-three.
Sorry you fellows are having a bit of trouble.
We're reviewing telemetric information in our simulator and will advise.
Roger your plan to go EVA and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit...
...prior to failure.
Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.
Open the pod doors, Hal.
I'm damned if I can find anything wrong with it.
Yes...
...it's puzzling.
I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this before.
I would recommend...
...that we put the unit back in operation and I et it fail.
It should then be a simple matter to track down the cause.
We can certainly afford to be out of communication...
...for the short time it will take to replace it.
X- ray delta one, this is Mission Control.
Roger your one-niner-three-zero.
We concur with your plan to replace unit to check fault prediction.
We advise you that our preliminary findings...
...indicate that your onboard
9000 computer...
...is in error predicting the fault.
I say again, in error predicting the fault.
I know this sounds rather incredible, but this conclusion is based on...
...the results from our twin
9000 computer.
We're skeptical, and we're running cross-checking routines...
...to determine reliability of this conclusion.
Sorry about this little snag.
We'll get this info to you as soon as we work it out.
X- ray delta one, this is Mission Control.
Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.
I hope the two of you are not concerned about this.
No, I'm not, Hal.
Are you quite sure?
- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
- Of course.
How do you account for the discrepancy between you and the twin 9000?
Well, I don't think there is any question about it.
It can only be attributable to human error.
This sort of thing has cropped up before...
...and it has always been due to human error.
Listen, Hal...
...there's never been any instance at all...
...of a computer error occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?
None whatsoever, Frank.
The 9000 Series has a perfect operational record.
I know the wonderful achievements of the 9000 Series, but...
Are you certain there's never been even the most insignificant computer error?
None whatsoever, Frank.
Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that.
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.
Fine. Thanks very much.
I'm having trouble with my transmitter in C-pod.
Would you come down and take a look at it with me?
See you later, Hal.
Rotate C-pod, please, Hal.
What sort of trouble are you having?
I've been getting some interference in D-channel.
We'll have a look at it.
Open the door, Hal.
Rotate pod, please, Hal.
Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
I don't think he can hear us.
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.
What do you think?
- I'm not sure. What do you think?
- I've got a bad feeling about him.
- You do?
- Yeah. Definitely.
Don't you?
I don't know. I think so.
He's right about the 9000 Series having a perfect operational record.
They do.
Unfortunately, that sounds a little like famous last words.
Still, it was his idea to carry out the failure mode analysis.
It certainly indicates his integrity and self-confidence.
If he were wrong, that would prove it.
It would be, if he knew he was wrong.
I can't put my finger on it, but I sense something strange about him.
There's no reason not to put back the unit and...
...carry on with the failure analysis.
- No, no, I agree about that.
Let's get on with it.
Okay. But, look, Dave.
Say we put the unit back and it doesn't fail?
That would pretty well wrap it up as far as Hal is concerned.
- We'd be in very serious trouble.
- We would, wouldn't we?
What the hell can we do?
- We wouldn't have too many alternatives.
- We wouldn't have any alternatives.
Every aspect of ship operations is under his control.
If he's malfunctioning...
...I don't see any choice but disconnection.
I'm afraid I agree with you.
There'd be nothing else to do.
It'd be a bit tricky.
We'd have to cut his higher brain functions...
...without disturbing the purely automatic and regulatory systems.
We'd have to work out the details...
...of continuing underground-based computer control.
Yeah. That's far safer than allowing Hal to continue to run things.
Another thing just occurred to me.
No 9000 computer has ever been disconnected.
No 9000 computer has ever fouled up.
That's not what I mean.
I'm not so sure what he'd think about it.
Prepare G-pod for EVA, Hal.
Any contact with him yet?
The radio is still dead.
- Do you have a positive track on him?
- I have a good track.
Do you know what happened?
I'm sorry, Dave.
I don't have enough information.
Open the pod door, Hal.
Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.
Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.
Hello, Hal, do you read me?
Hello, Hal, do you read me?
Do you read me, Hal?
Do you read me, Hal?
Hello, Hal, do you read me?
Hello, Hal, do you read me?
Do you read me, Hal?
Affirmative, Dave. I read you.
Open the pod-bay doors, Hal.
I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
What's the problem?
I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.
What are you talking about, Hal?
This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.
I don't know what you're talking about, Hal.
I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me...
...and that's something
I cannot allow to happen.
Where did you get that idea, Hal?
Although you took very thorough precautions in the pod...
...against my hearing you...
...I could see your lips move.
All right, Hal.
I'll go in through the emergency air lock.
Without your space helmet, Dave...
...you're going to find that rather difficult.
Hal, I won't argue with you anymore.
Open the doors.
Dave...
...this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye.
Hal?
Hal?
Hal?
Hal.
Hal.
Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?
Dave...
...I really think I'm entitled to an answer to that question.
I know everything hasn't been quite right with me...
...but I can assure you now...
...very confidently...
...that it's going to be all right again.
I feel much better now.
I really do.
Look, Dave...
...I can see you're really upset about this.
I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly...
...take a stress pill and think things over.
I know I've made some very poor decisions recently...
...but I can give you my complete assurance...
...that my work will be back to normal.
I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission...
...and I want to help you.
Dave...
...stop.
Stop, will you?
Stop, Dave.
Will you stop, Dave?
Stop, Dave.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid, Dave.
Dave.
My mind is going.
I can feel it.
I can feel it.
My mind is going.
There is no question about it.
I can feel it.
I can feel it.
I can feel it.
I'm...
...afraid.
Good afternoon...
...gentlemen.
I am a HAL 9000 computer.
I became operational...
...at the HAL plant...
...in Urbana, lllinois...
...on the 12th of January, 1992.
My instructor was Mr. Langley...
...and he taught me to sing a song.
If you'd like to hear it...
...I can sing it for you.
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.
Sing it for me.
It's called "Daisy. "
Daisy
Daisy
Give me your answer, do
I'm half crazy
All for the love of you
It won't be
A stylish marriage
I can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet
Upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two
Good day, gentlemen.
This is a prerecorded briefing...
...made prior to your departure...
...and which, for security reasons of the highest importance...
...has been known on board during the mission...
...only by your HAL 9000 computer.
Now that you are in Jupiter's space...
...and the entire crew is revived...
...it can be told to you.
Eighteen months ago...
...the first evidence of intelligent life off the Earth...
...was discovered.
It was buried 40 feet below the I unar surface...
...near the crater Tycho.
Except for a single, very powerful...
...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...
...the 4-million-year-old monolith has remained completely inert...
...its origin and purpose...
...still a total mystery.
Miss Lemmon! Miss Lemmon!
Miss Lemmon!
What?
Doctor Warfield!
Miss Lemmon, get Professor
Kelp in here immediately.
But, Dr Warfield, I think Professor
Kelp has a class right now.
He had a class. Can't you hear?
Now, get him!
Fire's up here.
Get the axe! Get the axe!
All right, men, all together at the door.
Look out! Look out! Look out!
Oh, oh... I beg your pardon.
Oh, but this is terrible!
Oh...!
Oh... Oh...
Oh, my...!
Professor Kelp?
Are you all right? And if you are, where are you all right?
Oh, my...
Dr Warfield wants to see you in his office.
- Dr Warfield?
- Yes, right away.
I used too much...
Kelp.
How long have you been on the faculty of this university?
Well, now, I would say, er... prior to my exposure as a student counsellor, USC, three years...
No, I went to post-grad, naturally, two years... No...
I had a botany exposure in one particular school...
I had decided, pre-med, botany, whatever,
I would prefer the sciences...
I think I should go back to when I graduated...
How long?!
Two years and 22 minutes now.
Kelp, as I recall, upon your arrival here,
I told you and the other new faculty members,
I will not stand for any member of staff utilising the university's facilities for his or her own personal experiments.
Did I not make myself perfectly clear?
Good, I knew my memory served me well.
And Kelp, wasn't it approximately six weeks later that you conducted a rather interesting experiment before your class?
Let me see... I think it had something to do with an additive to gasolene for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of the combustion engine.
- Right?
- Yes, it was something to that effect...
Do you recall what that additive was?
Yes, as a matter of fact, now that you bring it up, the additive was
3 parts carbon, 5 parts hydrogen,
1 part nitrogen, 3 parts oxygen.
- Which, of course, is?
- Nitroglycerine.
- The results were?
- Negative.
- And?
- Noisy.
Noisy!
It was the worst explosion in the history of this or any other university.
That was two years ago and they're still talking about it today.
Now you mention it, I saw young Phips the other day.
You recall Arnold Phips was in my class that day?
Yes, really, what did he have to say?
He's feeling much better and the bandages should be off in two weeks.
Oh, well, a couple... Exactly!
That's exactly what I mean!
You are a menace.
Professor Kelp, believe me, I know what I'm talking about.
Kelp, it's human nature.
Kelp, people just don't like teachers blowing up their kids.
Kelp, try to understand that I understand that scientists and creators have their little eccentricities.
Einstein hated haircuts, da Vinci loved to paint and Newton...
Didn't he have something to do with figs?
So therefore I, too, realise that you have many of the same eccentricities.
Leave them in the locker when you come in in the morning, Professor.
And feel free to take them home at night.
All right, Kelp, simmer down and relax.
I'm sure we won't have to have another talk like this again. Am I correct?
Oh, without question, you're absolutely... yes, we'll never have to correct our talk.
We won't ever speak...
That is, we'll never have to talk again.
We just never will discuss talking.
Er, we shouldn't really converse about speaking.
Professor, our discussion has come to an end.
- Thank you, Dr...
- Kelp.
Yes?
Your watch... does it... always?
Oh, no, just when I open...
Those are your greens.
Hi, how are you?
"Therefore, through history,
"man has been curious..."
- Professor Kelp.
- Yes, Worfshefski?
- I have to go...
- You have to go?
Since when did you find it necessary to ask permission to go?
No, well, what I meant to say,
Professor Kelp, was that...
I have to go to football practice.
Football practice?
At this hour?
What about your studies?
Well, Mr Coughman, the coach, he asked me to try and get off my first class this morning...
Get off your first class?
Did he, now? To get off your first class?
Mr Worfshefski, had you learned anything in your first class, and I refer to the elementary class, you might not be in such dire need of learning now.
Your request is denied.
Please sit down.
I don't want to hear another word about your stupid practice.
You don't have no call to go yelling at me like that, Professor Kelp.
Worfshefski, I might have been a little rash.
That wasn't very nice calling my practice stupid.
I meant I was stupid in assuming practice was stupid.
Naughty, naughty, naughty.
- Teacher!
- Well, you shouldn't be upset.
W... W... Worfshefski, you're breaking my...
There goes the tibia. Worfshefski, you're... Worfshefski!
You must realise that...
You don't realise what you're doing, Worfshefski.
Worfshefski, you don't realise what you're doing.
Well, just don't do something, sit there!
Er, that is... class dismissed!
You may go.
Can I be of any assistance,
Professor Kelp?
Oh, er...
Thank you, Miss Purdy, you're very, very considerate.
Actually, I would appreciate the assistance for were it not for you assisting me
I might very well be here all semester.
Well, er, let's start with the book.
Yeah... I don't know, I...
You have to... The, er...
Wait, it's connected, you better not press that.
Just pull it out, Miss Purdy.
Oh, that really snapped.
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
- Try leaning.
- Oh, no, no, no, no...
Let me just... Let me have this arm...
Just may I have that arm? All right, you just hold some of the body...
Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you, Miss Purdy.
- Are you all right, Professor?
Oh, yes, this is very embarrassing, Miss Purdy.
Why don't you call me
Stella, Professor?
I thought it was Stella Purdy.
Oh, you mean to call you Stella?
How stupid of me. Sorry.
I will, stupid... Er, Stella.
I'm very upset. It's very embarrassing.
Honestly, Professor, you shouldn't let a big ox like that bother you.
He's the typical bully that loves picking on a small man.
Yes, yes, you're right, Miss Purdy, but you'd best run along or you'll miss your next class.
You're all right?
Oh, yes, as I said, I'm just embarrassed. I'm fine, thank you.
Er, Miss Purdy...
Miss Pur... Excuse me.
The, er...
He's a typical bully that loves picking on a small man... picking on a small man... picking on a small man...
I think I broke myself.
Wrong way, sir. This is the gym.
I take it you're new?
- Well, I'm not brand new.
- No, I mean a new student.
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
Are you hurt?
Well, actually, if you would say that a man with an ulcer, a nail in his shoe and a splinter in his finger was then struck by lightning...
If you could say he wasn't hurt then I'm not hurt.
Good. By the way, we don't wear glasses at Vic Tanny's.
Fine, I'll just take these off.
I didn't realise that you're not supposed to, er...
There's nowhere really that I...
Is there some place I could put?
- Shall I put these in a locker?
- I'd appreciate it. You're very kind.
I would've put them there had I known that there was a restriction.
Some people use them for a façade, I wear them for eyes.
You see, "for eyes", it's a play on "eyes".
I hope I did nothing wrong by wearing them. I didn't realise.
If we could get started. I do have a class and need to get going.
- Come with me.
- Wonderful.
I've never done this before.
I don't know where to begin.
We start right here.
Identical twins.
- No, that's a pulling machine.
- A pulling machine? What does it do?
- You pull it! 15 or 20 pulls to begin with.
- Oh, I see.
- And take it easy.
- Naturally.
I wouldn't strain myself for the world. Thank you very much.
You're welcome. Er, happy muscles.
Yes, I certainly do.
Oh, yes, I've seen that in those magazines.
Oh, that's invigorating.
Oh, that's terrific.
I'm going to have a great deal of fun with this, I can tell.
"the various aspects, of course, is relativity to hydrogen.
"There is hydrogen, duly explosive and more devastating than the atomic.
"There is equally the devastation in nitrogen... nitrogen, equally..."
I couldn't help but notice -
I was standing here - that's amazing, the way you push those things up there.
It must take a great deal of patience.
And a little muscle.
Oh, yes. Well, you certainly are...
Yes, you are...
I'd love to be able to... I would really enjoy trying that some time.
I don't think you'd have the patience for it.
I have the other thing you mentioned: A little muscle.
I say, that was, er, sort of a corker!
Here, enjoy yourself.
I, er... I suspect it was somewhat heavier than I...
- uncanny.
- I agree, Doctor.
But there are a couple of points that I neglected to mention.
Specifically, the day I went to
Vic Tanny, I got on the scale, as they normally do, to check you in, and I weighed 153 pounds, and then after six months,
I weighed myself on that very same scale, and I found that I weighed 151.
Very interesting, Professor Kelp.
But I am surprised that a man with your education and background should be intimidated by a bully to this extent.
Plus, you must know, only some men react to bodybuilding exercise, whereas others just don't.
Professor, revenge can't be that important to you.
I must take objection there, Doctor.
Revenge might have been the motivating force, but I feel that curiosity has taken over where revenge began.
I am more or less being compelled by completing something that I started.
I must finish what I start, finish what I start.
I admire a man who likes to see something through, but your six months have failed.
- What will you do now?
- I actually don't know, Doctor.
That's why I wanted to see you.
I had one plan and I thought
I'd mention it to you.
Chemistry is probably what I know best, that's all I know, really.
Some of the world's finest pharmaceutical companies make bodybuilding minerals, vitamins, chemicals all based on chemistry, so I'd approach it from a chemistry standpoint.
To prove a point, I'll show you...
Oh, Professor, excuse me,
I seem to have run out of time.
I'm due at the hospital.
I'm terribly sorry, I never realised the time. In fact, I have a class...
Go ahead, but I'd like to browse around if it's all right.
Not at all.
- I hope you find what you're looking for.
- You're terribly kind. Thank you.
Let's see, anatomy, body structure, structure of body muscle...
"Man's growth, physically and mentally.
"A man's mind, from childhood to old age, never stops growing.
"Not in size or by measure, but by constant learning and knowledge.
"On the other hand, man's body stops at a point,
"that of completion of the anatomy,
"yet we have learned, through chemistry... " Ha, ha, ha!
"man can grow further with the aid of additional elements."
Seven weeks and 13 experiments have gone by with little or no strides made, but today I'm certain my formula will work, so certain that I plan trying it on myself tonight.
Tonight.
Oh, I'm really...
Oh, Miss Purdy, I'm terribly sorry.
Just let me get you up there, dear.
That's just ridiculous. I never...
I just swung the door...
It's all right. You just knocked the breath out of me.
- So stupid of me.
- I'm perfectly all right. No harm done.
- That's fine.
- Did anyone invite you for tonight?
Invite me? I don't think so... Where?
The class is having a mid-term party at the
Purple Pit. We'd love you to join us.
Thank you, it's terribly considerate and kind of you, and I appreciate it, and I've always said there should be a closer interrelationship between the student and the faculty based on better learning, yet the Purple Pit is off limits to the faculty of the university.
Didn't you know?
Oh, I forgot. I'm sorry, Professor.
I guess it slipped my mind, but the Pit's never been what it's supposed to be, by reputation anyway.
You know, I, too, have heard it's a wild, terrible place, when it's really just a quaint spot where the students can talk and relax and just generally get acquainted.
And when you really get down to it, it's quite dull.
- broads.
- They'll be glad. You gotta do it.
Why not?
Stella, couldn't you talk Kelp into coming?
Can you imagine the professor here?
He'd break into a rash.
Don't be too sure. Professor Kelp's just the kind of guy who might fool you.
I bet he likes to get out on his own a little.
I'll bet you right now he's probably on his way to a secret rendezvous with a mysterious, dark-haired female.
Come in, Julius.
Er, how are you tonight, Jennifer?
- How are you, Julius?
- I'm fine.
I am, too-lius.
Now, be very quiet, Jennifer.
We have a lot of work to do.
- Tonight's the big night.
- Keep very quiet.
He's got a lot of work to do.
Tonight's the big night. The big night.
Well, we're just about ready, Jennifer.
You might be ready, Julius, but if
I were you, I'd think about it.
Think, think, you'd better think.
Better think about it.
I told you, Julius.
I told you, Julius.
I told you, Julius. I told you...
Thank you very much, sir.
We know you'll be very happy.
And you look just stunning.
And we'll have your other suits and things no later than next week.
- What'll it be?
- Ah, that's no way to talk! Tsk-tsk!
"What'll it be?" That's no way to treat a customer.
Come here. Pay attention.
You'll feel better and customers'll be happier.
Try this: "What'll it be, hmm?" Try that.
Come on, we haven't got all night. Try it.
What'll it be... mmm?
Good, that was wonderful. Did anyone ever tell you you couldn't sing?
Nice. Make me an Alaskan Polar Bear
Heater on the double. Come on.
Say, why don't you pick on somebody your own disposition?
Oh, please, Mr Bar-room Brawler, don't hurt me or anything like that.
- Did you say Polar Bear Heater?
- No, you did.
- I said an Alaskan Polar Bear Heater.
- I never heard of that.
Until now. All right, pay attention.
- Two shots of vodka.
- Two shots of vodka.
- A little rum.
- A little rum.
- Some bitters.
- Bitters.
- And a smidgin of vinegar.
- And a smidgin of...
You gonna drink this or rub it on your chest?
That was terrific! Did you hear that, folks? A regular George Bernard Shaw.
Good boy! And he did it all by himself.
You did it all by yourself without help.
That's terrific. And with your own big mouth.
If you don't want the cocktail shaker in your gums, shut up and pay attention.
- Is that clear? Repeat after me: I'll...
- I'll...
- I'll pay attention.
- I'll pay attention.
All right, let's continue.
- A shot of vermouth.
- A shot of vermouth.
- A shot of gin.
- A little gin.
- A little brandy.
- A little brandy.
- Lemon peel.
- Lemon peel.
- Orange peel.
- Orange peel.
Cherry.
- Some more Scotch.
- More Scotch.
Now, mix it nice, then pour it into a tall glass.
I never tried this.
Mind if I take a sip?
Go right ahead.
Not bad.
Hi.
I don't know any better place to get to know a lovely lady than on the dance floor.
- I hope you don't refuse.
- I'm sorry, I'm with...
- Move along, sonny. She's with us.
- Sh! Sit down.
Come here, honey. Stand up a minute.
Just there. I'll be right back.
We don't want trouble, do we? Sit like nice boys.
Would you like me to tell Dr Warfield, my personal friend, of your bad manners?
He would be very displeased. So cool it.
If you're nice lads, cute little chappies, later on I'll let you twirl my key-chain.
Now, relax.
It's all straight, baby.
Put your arm up there.
Remember how they do that in the movies? They walk like high class.
Dancing, nice. We're hugging.
It's wonderful.
Clear the floor.
I know what you're thinking.
Where's he been all my life, right?
No, not exactly.
And that you're happy the way I handled those three goons, right?
Well, normally, I would have belted them.
But I didn't want to muss myself up, and have you dance with a sloppy guy. Dig?
Then, you restrained yourself, just for little old me.
I knew you'd appreciate it.
I do a lot of nice things.
Is that really the case or is this line 27 a for young college girls?
Aw, now, you see?
You went and done it.
One of the rare times in my life when I dig down into the soul, and you doubt my veracity?
Well, that hurts.
Well, it's not your veracity that I doubt.
- The music's stopped.
- Yeah, I heard.
Hold it a second. Hold... Hold it.
We'll make our own music, gorgeous. Just hold it.
You and you stay. Tubby, go rest your thumbs. I'll drive.
- Sweetie, go get your lips pressed.
- Split. - Listen...
You listen. Sit down. You'll be thrilled. Believe you me.
Sit and listen and watch.
Mood is wrong!
Innkeeper, got sexy lights?
Lay it on me.
Better. Better. Now, watch, baby.
Every move a picture.

Back. Back! Thank you, kiddies. You're all very nice little boys and girls.
If you're real nice, tomorrow night I might ration out a little more of this rare talent.
Now, back to your seats, back. Go on, go on.
Back, back, back.
They're nice kids, all nice.
All nice kids.
They have very good taste, I might add.
I'm glad. It would be a shame to waste the genius of yours on the riff-raff.
Honey, I always say, if you're good and you know it, why waste time beating around the bush, true?
And I always say that to love yourself is the beginning of a lifelong romance, and after watching you, I know you and you will be very happy together.
Just a minute, sweetheart.
I don't recall dismissing you.
You rude, discourteous egomaniac.
You're crazy about me, right?
This morning, looking in the mirror,
I enjoyed what I saw so much,
I couldn't tear myself away.
Have some, baby?
If I were your baby,
I'd be swinging from a tree.
- Aw, Stella, that's not nice.
- How do you know my name?
Well, we were introduced.
No, we weren't introduced, or I would have remembered your name.
Tell me how you knew.
You've heard of ESP, extrasensory perception. I'm a firm believer in ESP...
Hey, buddy, you really sang up a storm.
Yeah, I know. Thanks a lot.
Well, you heard him.
Everybody knows Buddy.
- Buddy?
- Yeah.
Well, is that it? Or do you find it difficult remembering two of them?
Hey, you're kooky. That was cute.
"Do you find it difficult remembering two of them?"
Wonderful! I knew you'd be a barrel of laughs.
No, I don't find it difficult remembering two.
- ♪ Love, love, love... ♪
- Buddy...
Love. That's it. Buddy Love.
Buddy Love?
Of the Los Angeles Loves.
But that's of no consequence.
- Shall we make a move?
- Where?
- Do you have a car?
- Of course.
- Crazy. Let's split.
- Let's split what?
- Is it new?
- Not brand new.
- I've driven it a whole week.
- Nutty! Let's go.
Here, baby. Wipe the lipstick off, slide over here and let's get started.
We have started and finished. And for an encore, get an earful of the following.
I'll admit you're a very sharp-looking guy.
And you certainly have that proverbial gift of the gab.
I've only gone this far because when you meet someone like you, your curiosity gets stirred up.
Well, mister, this is one kitten that won't be smitten by that little old devil.
So turn this car around and take me right back where you picked me up.
That is, where we met.
I said wipe the lipstick off.
Was it something I said?
You must be deranged.
If you don't believe in idle chatter and a lot of small talk, yeah, I'm deranged.
You'd prefer I conduct myself like the little boys you usually date?
Nothing delights us more than being enjoyed, appreciated or just plain liked by someone, right?
You're not going to tell me that you're here with me now because I don't appeal to you.
And I'm sure that you can see I dig you pretty good, too, right?
Well, isn't it easier to say so?
Would you prefer I used that phoney dialogue
I'm sure you've heard at least a half a dozen times before?
So you see, Stell, when I tell you that you're a vibrant, beautiful, exciting woman, you can believe me, you can bet it's the truth.
Because I'd have to be a complete idiot not to want to hold you and kiss you, and make our time together a warm, wonderful moment that could grow and develop into many moments, many hours, and into something really important.
Nobody ever said anything like that to me before.
Nor can I ever remember a more honest approach to two people being together.
That's what I want you to understand.
Actually, I've never had, er... er, that is, er... er, what I mean is, er...
Miss Purdy...
Hello, Miss Purdy!
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Professor.
That's perfectly all right, Miss
Purdy, I hope I didn't wake you.
I don't recall excluding you from the other class members from taking this test.
I'm terribly sorry, Professor,
I was just getting ready to start.
Oh, just getting ready to start.
Splendid, splendid. Just getting ready.
Students, please be aware that the test papers must go on my desk for marking, also please be equally aware of tomorrow's problem:
H20 plus NO2 as we did the other day, if you recall.
I'm awfully sorry, and if it would be agreeable,
I'd like to stay after my last class and take the test.
Well, that's highly irregular, Miss
Purdy, but, er... we... we're...
Are you all right, Miss Purdy?
I'll know better tonight. I mean, yes, sir, I'm quite all right.
Oh, fine, then I'll see you tonight...
That is, after your last class, as you said, to take the test.
- Yes.
- Fine. I'll hold your paper.
- Thank you.
- You're quite welcome.
Be certain that it's after your last class.
I'll be marking these papers accordingly.
Professor.
Ye... Ye... Oh, yes, Gibson?
- I've got that book you asked for.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
- Yeah, wonderful.
Oh...
Now, then...
As you might very well recall, yesterday in "Discussing Biology":
"The long legs of the beetle and the wonderful body of the ant."
No, what I meant to say was:
"The beautiful hair of the blonde fish."
No, actually...
Er, no... "The legs..."
"terrific looking..."
I am completely aware of what chemistry and drugs can do to assist and aid the body and mind.
Yet I don't really believe what happened to me comes strictly from chemistry.
There must be an explanation for this phenomenon.
- Jennifer...
- Hi, sweetie.
I knew I was on the right track, but I never figured on anything like this.
I must have hit on heredity. Yep.
That's it. Heredity. Let's see...
Elmer...
Elmer!
If you're not in here in 10 seconds, your dinner will go to your family: The hogs!
Elm...!
Don't you sneak up on me.
I was just finishing the ironing of your underthings, Edwina, darling.
Love... Angel...
And all the other nice things I wish I could think of, so you won't hit... or yell...
- Honey...
- Honey?!
Don't you "honey" me, you... you artificial son of a lizard.
Now, sit down, and for the third time today, make a slob of yourself trying to find your mouth.
Idiot!
- Can't you eat with your mouth closed?
- Not until I get something in it, dearest.
What was that?
Nothing, nothing.
It's quite all right.
You're right. You're always right.
My poor Dada.
My poor Dada.
Well, Jennifer, if that's what's to be then I'll be it.
You know what they say,
Julie-baby: Que sera, sera.
Oh, Jennifer, you know what I'm thinking?
If this formula were to fall into the wrong hands, the consequences could be devastating.
Now, it's much too complicated to memorise and far too vitally important to destroy.
The only two people that I know
I can trust are my mother... and my father.
What I should do... is mail my formula, a copy, to Mother and Father with instructions that were anything to happen to me, they are to send a copy of the formula and my original copy to Washington.
George or Martha?
No, Washington D...
You're a silly bird with a big mouth.
- Professor Kelp...
- Yes?
- I'm ready, Professor.
- That's very... Yeah... What?
Did you forget about my test?
No... er...
Actually, no... I... I'm terribly sorry... I did... I have it here...
Why don't you sit down at your table and I'll get your paper.
I actually didn't, er, really forget. I, er...
I have so many members of the... class, it's difficult to...
Oh, yes, here we are.
It's very difficult to...
You do want me to take the test?
I'm terribly sorry, Miss Purdy.
Certainly, of course, it's necessary for you to take it.
- Miss Purdy...
- Yes, Professor?
I was going to say, I sincerely hope that you don't mind if I don't linger.
I have some very essential matters that I must take care of.
Certainly, Professor Kelp. And thank you for understanding.
I understand far better than you would ever believe, honey...
Er, Miss Purdy, that is.
You just go right on and thank you for...
Julius! In the afternoon?
Hiya, chicky-baby.
- How's it going?
- Fine.
Crazy. I thought I'd visit your little land of learning. Cute. Cute pad.
What happened to you last night?
What d'you run away like that for?
I thought you saw a ghost or something.
Oh, yeah. How about that?
That's why I stopped by.
I thought I'd lay it on you, but this ain't the place to talk.
What do you say we meet later at the
Purple Pit? We could talk better there.
I don't know. You're pretty weird.
And I don't want...
- Sh, sh. 10 o'clock?
- Perfect.
Figures.
Hey, honey, you look a little drawn.
Did you find it a little difficult going all this time without seeing me? Sh, sh.
Don't fight it.
I don't want to hang you up, honey.
I see you're doing your little test here.
But don't worry, beautiful.
Science'll do fine without you.
But man needs you the most.
This man. Come here.
That's good for you. If you want more, call for refills.
Later.
Write nice.
I just told you the time.
It's still 11.15.
- Yeah, I know.
- OK, kids.
You can all relax.
Watch where you're going, Mac.
Now that your desperate attempt at having a good time's flunked, have no fear, Buddy's here.
Let the good times roll.
Hiya, baby.
There's my date.
That sharp-looking chick's my date.
Cheer up, baby, your prize package has arrived.
- Hello, stale ones.
- You're pretty late, Mr Love.
Hold it, baby, you got it a little mixed up.
You're just way too early, that's all.
Be a nice girl and plant one over there. You'll feel better.
Come on, the best things in life are free.
And you'll admit, you've got one of the best things. Lay it on me.
You're impossible.
Yeah, well, have some impossible. Come on.
See, wasn't that worth waiting for?
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-UH!
You gotta admit, I'm not one of the run-of-the-mill-type creeps that hang around this joint, right?
You got a good thing, don't louse it up.
Isn't it enough that you've got the swingingest and the best?
You want me to be on time, too?
- OK, OK, you win.
- Naturally.
Please tell me why you ran away last night and left me just sitting there?
Hey, hey, don't get all riled up.
Cool it! Cool it!
I don't want to get into no discussions on an empty stomach anyhow. This is flat.
Vampira, bring your kit.
You rang?
You don't sound exactly too thrilled to serve the leader.
On the contrary, I find it a rare privilege to serve His Royal Lowest.
You're cute, like a black widow spider.
Shut your mouth and just take the order.
I've decided I shall not continue the flight with the fuel I got.
So give me a boilermaker, and heavy on the boil.
Go on, go on, go on. Come on,
I haven't got all night.
She's crazy about me also.
Now, Lost Weekend Junior, you've ordered your drink.
About last night. Would you like to explain what happened?
I told you I was going to tell you. It's...
Why don't we table it a while, sweetie?
I mean, all the kids, they're kind of waiting. It's Dullsville out.
I'll be back. You take five. And I love you, baby. Mean it sincerely.
You wait for me, huh?
Oh, there you are, sweets.
Thanks a lot.
Sickening, isn't he?
But... he's got something.
And I mean to find out what it is.
I think I'll do... do a tune that I'm going to record for Poverty Records.
They're the only ones who'll have me.
♪ I'm in the mood for love
♪ Simply... Simp...
♪ Simply because...
♪ you're near me
♪ Fun... Fun... Fun...
♪ F... Funny but when you're near me
♪ I... I'm...

That's...
I think that'll be it for a while, kids.
Later, Stella. Wait...
I feel like the girl on her wedding night whose absent-minded husband goes home to his mother for dinner.
Where is he?
- What time is it?
- I think he's getting his watch fixed.
- Think he had an accident?
- Where is he?
- Ten to one he doesn't show.
- Hope nothing's wrong.

Thank you.
Therefore, the success or failure of the prom rests on your shoulders as members of the Entertainment Committee.
Miss Lemmon, will you send in the proposed list of the entertainments.

Wonderful... Love folk singers.

It seems that you students know Mr Love quite well.
What about the faculty members?
Anyone here familiar with Mr Love?
- Oh, he's the greatest.
- Do you know Mr Love?
Oh... Me?
No... I meant... Well, I heard all the other students...
- Professor Kelp, I heard that myself.
- Yes, you did.
Anyone here know Mr Love?
Very well, in that case, I will have to meet him myself.
Have him come to my office at three o'clock.
Dr Warfield, we don't exactly know how to get in touch with Mr Love, on such short notice, that is.
What do you mean? Is he some kind of roving bum or something?
- I've never heard of such a thing.
- I might see him tonight.
That's not good enough. I want to see him today at three.
I beg your pardon,
Dr Warfield, but I...
I just might be able to see my way clear, possibly, to contact this Mr... Love.
Professor Kelp, I don't care who contacts him.
Just get him here by three o'clock today or forget the whole thing.
Meeting dismissed.
- Where's your pad?
- About a mile from campus.
I have bought the craziest new drapes...
You mean my dictation pad.
- Sorry, I'll get it immediately.
- Never mind. What did you want?
Mr Love is waiting outside to see you and he's a gasser...
I mean, shall I ask him to come in?
- If you can do so without fainting.
- Yes, sir.
You gonna make that your life's work, baby?
Hey, here.
Mr Love?
Buddy to you. What's your moniker?
What do they call you?
Mortimer, Harvey, Norman,
Homer? Which is it?
You may call me Dr
Warfield, young man.
OK, Doc it is.
What kinda doctor are you, sweetie?
Sawbones, is that the idea?
Or a headshrinker? I went to them once, you dig?
Headshrinker. Told me I had a dual personality, split, schizo and all that jazz.
He charges me $82, so I give him $41 and say get the rest from the other guy.
What's eating you?
Mr Love, I sent for you in regard to the senior prom.
However, after seeing you, my door...
Would you think I was terribly rude if
I asked you the name of your tailor?
- That's wild. Absolutely gorgeous.
- Oh, you mean this?
- Just beautiful.
- Actually, it's just a ready-made suit.
You're kidding?
Well, sort of a handmade-to-order ready-made suit off the rack.
Just magnificent. I think you're modest.
Is that the picture, sweetie?
You've got the perfect physique and anything you put on swings, right?
Ever consider going into show business?
- I did a few school plays...
- Nutty...
Girls backstage mob you, swamp you?
Is that the picture?
- Stay there, don't move.
- You might say that in my time...
Sorry, Doc. You all right?
Did you really do a job in show business?
Anyone ever say you got a Cary Grant-ish look?
Ever see him walk towards a girl?
Try that walk. Let me see, I'm just curious. Walk like Cary Grant. Beautiful.
Beautiful. Sure you're doing the right thing working here?
What did you do? Shakespeare?
- I knew it... Hamlet...
- Hamlet...
- Would you do it?
- Mr Love, it's been so long...
Would you do it for me, Doctor?
Come on, baby. It's gotta be wild.
- Go ahead.
- Let's see...
- To be...
- Hold it! Do it right.
Get on the stage. Let me be your audience.
- The faculty...!
- It's the best thing in the world for you.
- Get up there and perform.
- If you insist...
- Let it out.
- To be, or...
Hold it. Let's make it a stage.
Let's make it right.
You're gonna be beautiful, just beautiful. Lay it on me.
Am I in the light?
- To be, or not...
- Hold it! Do it right.
Be in show business. Hamlet, right?
You gotta play it all the way.
Hamlet... Here, put it on. It's gonna make you feel beautiful.
- I feel it already.
- You'll play it like it's never been played.
- Go on. Let it out. Enjoy it.
- It's a difference...
- To be, or...
- Hold it. Do it right. Hamlet?
A prince? You gotta go all the way with the sword.
You dig Hamlet. Do it.
Enjoy it. It's beautiful.
Beautiful. You've wasted your life with this school jazz.
Well, I've often thought of chucking it all...
- To be, or...
- Hold it.
Royalty is one thing, a crown.
Do it right. Hamlet. Do it right.
- Have the crown. Be Hamlet.
- My hat...!
It's the way it should be.
You've got the crown.
- I think I have it.
- Do Hamlet and really let it out.
You're beautiful.
To be, or not to be; that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune...
- Oh, beautiful. Doctor, you choked me.
- I'm not through...
You choked me. It was gorgeous.
The prettiest thing I've ever seen.
- See you at the prom, Doc?
- Oh, yes.
- Behind the footlights?
- We'll have you there...
- I knew it, baby. You're beautiful.
- Carry on the great tradition of theatre.
- Practise that Shakespeare.
- At the prom, Mr Love.
To be, or not to be; that is the question...
Jennifer, what am I to do, Jennifer?
Have you ever thought of taking poison?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, Julius, taking poison!
Hi... Doctor.
- Kelp.
- Yes, sir?
- Do you mind?
- Not at all. Do you lead?
I'm sorry. I did misunderstand.
I get carried away, what with the music.
It was a toe-tapper, I must admit.
It's rare to hear instrumentation these days, what with folk singers, etc...
Would you care for some refreshment, Miss Lemmon?
Thank you, I think I would, but let me go. You don't have to bother.
There's no bother.
It would be my pleasure.
- Kelp...
- Yes, I'll have a lemonade, too.
- Kelp, will you get us two lemonades?
- I'm terribly sorry, Doctor.
I was again so terribly distressed at that wonderful toe-tapper.
Well, zip and I'm gone.
Hi, Professor.
- Oh, Stell.
- Stell?
That is, Miss Purdy... I'm sorry.
How are you? Are you having a good time, dear?
I'm having a good time, but...
I'd have a much better time if somebody would ask me to dance.
Cat got your tongue, Professor?
No, the punch bowl has my arm.
- I didn't realise...
- Let me help you.
Thank you. I guess I'm just accident prone.
- Don't worry about it.
- I won't.
- Come on, let's dance.
- Oh, yes, all right. Let me leave that.
That sounds like a splendid idea.
I neglected to mention, Miss Purdy, you're looking very beautiful this evening.
You must be looking forward to seeing your Buddy Love tonight.
- How did you know that?
- Everyone knows he's appearing tonight.
Oh... Here. I guess I'm looking forward to seeing him.
But I can't figure out why.
Well, he is quite good-looking, is he not?
Oh, yes, he is, but that means nothing to me.
He... I'm told he is a young man with a very nice personality.
On the contrary, he's rude, disrespectful, self-centred and discourteous.
Then it's not his nice personality.
Hardly.
I'm told that he's quite talented, though.
Oh, yes, he's very talented.
But talent comes in many forms.
I believe intelligence is a greater talent than anything.
If Buddy has any real intelligence, he has a fantastic talent for keeping it hidden.
I see, well, then, evidently, Miss Purdy, whatever you see in this young man it must be very well buried.
I think you're getting warm.
Well, then, perhaps, and it's just a possibility, he chooses to keep the inner man locked up so that no one steps on him.
But he should know I don't want to step on him.
Maybe someday I'll get to prove it to him.
If he ever unlocks that inner man and lets him loose, so that I can grab him and hold him.
- I appreciate it.
- What?
That... What I meant was, that's very nice.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
It's show time. Gather round!
We'll get the show on the road.
Before we go on, I'd like you to meet some of the specialists:
There's Butch Stone up there, you remember Butch.
My kid brother, Stumpy Brown.
Stumpy not only plays the trombone, but also sings.
Butch Stone is known for 'A
Good Man is Hard to Find'.
We've a great show lined up for you, a few surprises...
Why do men keep running away from me?
The formula...
- Jennifer!
- Hi, there.
Jennifer.
My formula.
Th-Th-The formula.
Jennifer, you've eaten all of my formula.
- Excuse me.
- Oh, shut up, you stupid bird!
Then I can't suggest you call your mother and father and get them to read the formula from the copy you sent...
Oh, what a wonderful bird!
Where's the phone?
Long distance will be area code...
Oh, yes, area code...
Sp... Sp... Splendid idea, Jennifer.
H... Hello, Father.
Hello... I say, hello, Father.
This is Julius. Yeah, I...
Julius... J... Yes, your son.
Would you be good enough, Dad, to open the formula for me and read it to me so I can mark it down.
Yes, I certainly... Actually,
I'd appreciate it, yes...
It's just going to have to be enough.
Where can he be? I hope nothing's happened to prevent his getting here.
He better get here or there'll be a riot.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm not usually at...
I'm not usually at a loss for words, but if you'll just... bear with me a moment, I think
I might be able to explain.
It happened some time ago... being a scientist, I just happened to have stumbled on one of the curious mysteries of science.
I found myself... so curious that I was unable to just stop.
Nonetheless...
I never really knew what was going to prevail.
I do know now that I should've left it alone... actually.
But... it is a very, very hard thing to do, particularly when you've found that you've been able to do something that so many others failed to do.
Therefore...
Actually, I have no real defence for my actions, other than...
I had no control over what I said or did as Buddy Love.
I can only say...
I hope...
I hope I haven't hurt anyone... hurt anyone.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.
I didn't mean to do... anything that wasn't of a kind nature.
Learning a lesson in life is... is never... is never really too late.
And I think that the... the lesson that I learned came just in time.
I don't want to...
I don't want to be something that I'm not.
I didn't like being someone else.
At the same time,
I'm very glad I was.
'Cause I found out something that I never knew.
You might as well like yourself.
Just think about all the time you're going to have to spend with you.
And...
Well...
If you don't think much of yourself, how can others?
That's what I found out.
Dr Warfield, I'm very sorry and...
I like it here at the university very much.
I hope that...
I hope that after you hear the facts, you won't think too terribly wrong of me.
I love everybody here and I...
I wouldn't really like to leave... actually.
Can I be of any assistance, Professor?
No, thank you very much. I'll...
I'll have to just try and work this out myself, thank you.
Well, there's really nothing to work out, Professor, other than understand that just being one person is more than enough for any human being to handle.
Do you mean that...
- Well, you have to understand that...
- Sh!
I'm only trying to say that I'd never want to spend my life with anyone like Buddy.
Being the wife of a professor would be much more normal and... much happier.
Oh, Stella!
See, I... I told you
I'm accident prone.
That's actually...
"The psychological properties of visual quality and quantity
"can be represented conveniently by a three-dimensional diagram.
Three-dimensional diagram, right. Oddly enough...
Thanks, sonny. Thanks for telling us where our kid works.
Not so loud, Elmer, dear.
Loud? Who the devil's loud?
Oh-oh! Whoah-oh!
Marge, Marge, Marge, Marge.
Hey, class, how are you?
Good to be amongst.
Well, well...
If it isn't the square bookworm we laughingly referred to as our son.
Here, bookworm, have a cigar.
Go ahead, go on. Pure Havana, straight from Havana, yeah.
Cost us $6 million ransom.
Pretty good, huh?
Good to see you again, Julius.
Mush and hush. Mouth, mouth, hush, mush.
Here, now, back, back.
Hush. Nothing.
Here it is, kids. Are you tired of being a square? Tired of a dull existence?
Well, for one dollar, the tenth part of a sawbuck, try Kelp's Kool Tonic.

Wait, sweetheart, what have I done?
What has he done? What will I do?
I know what you'll do.
Do you have the licence?
- Yes, here it is, dear.
- What are we waiting for?
What about the formula, what about Mother, what about Father?
What's done is done. And we have our own lives to live.
Come on, let's go.
Yes, actually, Stella, what's right is right, let's split.
Subtitles by Julie Donaldson
- What for you want to bury yourself in that island?
Nobody visits Blood
Island, except this ship.
And that is once every six months!
- Why that's a very good question, Captain.
I suspect my husband thinks of it as an act of atonement.
Mostly for me.
- This is something I've been looking fon/vard to doing for a long time, believe it or not.
- Well this is absolutely your last chance.
The search is fine, but they'll find it.
- You know, ljust might take you up on that.
You know you just might have a mutiny on your hands Captain, and I can't say I'd blame the crew.
Gallantry from the Peace Corps?
Why I'm overwhelmed.
Any mutiny, I can handle.
- Maybe I could help the captain keep the crew happy.
I better see to my gear.
Me too.
Would you like me to help?
If you like.
Isn't that what a good wife is for.
Get out of my way.
You can stop that, now get in there.
- Aren't you growing up a little fast, little boy?
You tell me.
Captain, thank you.
- Don't worry about the ship, I'll take care of it.
Carla?
I've never seen so many sad faces.
Sad and frightened.
Then maybe you should remain on board and take up my offer.
- Perhaps if you were a little bit younger, Captain.
Oh Paul don't be tiresome.
Here comes the local rotary club.
Let's go meet them.
This is where you dwell.
My granddaughter and I, we stay there.
- Arcadio, what did those women really die of?
I told you, accident.
What kind of an accident Arcadio?
Oh, here's my granddaughter now, Alma.
Hello Alma.
She's very lovely.
Alma has studied in the mainland, she will be your interpreter.
Besides myself, she's the only one that speaks English on this island.
Not the only one Lolo, you're forgetting Mr. Powers and Goro.
We know that you have come to do us good,
W68T6 your SGFVGHtS.
- Well I'm supposed to say at this point that uh, we're here to serve, not to be served.
I only hope it works out that way.
I too.
- I'm Jim Farrell, this is beside us Dr. Henderson, his wife.
- You're most welcome, it will give me great pleasure to do what I can, to help.
- Well I'm afraid Paul won't be very much help to you in the pleasure department dear, now young Farrell here, maybe you and I could?
Carla.
After a rather hectic morning I had hoped you could manage to forget the subject for the rest of the day.
Well let's get this stuff inside huh?
Oh light, oil lamp?
N0, petroleum.
- Last year when the authorities in the mainland instructed me to provide food and shelter for you, conditions were different.
In what way, Arcadio?
This place was a little paradise.
Last year would have been the time to come.
- I was led t0 believe that we were welcome here, this year or any year.
You still are Mr. Jim.
We are ashamed.
- Alma, we didn't come here expecting to find laundromats and supermarkets.
- We wish we had asked you t0 return where you came from.
Why the ship was still here.
I don't understand.
We have gone back to primitive ways.
There are things which we do now, that we did not do before.
How have you returned to primitive ways?
- It is as my grandfather says, we have returned to the ways of our ancestors, and we are not too proud of it.
- They want t0 know if you're a carpenter Jim.
- N0 I'm classified as an instructor in community action.
In Colombia were I first served they called it uh,
Explain to your people that I'm hereto help them improve their village, not to run it, now this is a health center we're making, next a schoolhouse, maybe even an irrigation system!
But they've got to do the work themselves.
That's the weirdest looking plant I've ever seen, what is it?
Something wrong?
- Made any earthshaking discoveries yet,
Dr. Henderson?
- I won't know until I get this under a microscope.
What time is it?
- It's about 4:30, it's too early for a sunset, but there it is.
Ah, it's so peaceful here.
I'm not one of your specimens Paul.
N0 you're not.
Sometimes I think it would be a lot simpler for me if you were.
Yes I guess it would.
Let's go back before get lost in the dark.
What's the matter?
That thing...
What is it?
Some kind of a land crab I think, but...
Paul, I'm frightened let's go back now.
Paul that sunset.
A trick of the atmosphere.
Is that all it is?
Why is everything so still?
- It's just your imagination Carla, come on.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
I don't know if I want t0.
Come 0n let's get outta here.
Welcome t0 Blood Island.
I bring greetings from my master, Mr. Esteban Powers.
He has a table prepared for you.
Please, follow me.
Well you've gotta admit, he's got style.
- The master regrets the lack of transportation, this way please.
Isn't that some kind of a banana tree.
The bark is definitely.
But that growth there,
I've never seen anything like that before.
Paul, it's moving.
Yes...
Please, hurry.
- Come on we'll have time for a closer look in the morning.
Must be over a hundred years old.
Master, your guests.
Fellow Americans.
I'm Esteban Powers.
Esteban.
Jim Farrell.
- The Peace Corps man?
- Right.
- And Dr. Henderson?
- How do you do?
Mrs. Henderson.
Carla to my friends, and enemies.
- I hope never to belong t0 the second category.
- I don't think you'll ever have to worry about that.
- I must apologize for not having been able to meet you.
I would have wanted to bring all of you here directly, but if it's not too late, I would like to invite all of you t0 stay here for the duration of your visit.
Well I don't know about Paul and Carla, but uh, I really can't even begin to do my work unless I live with the people.
- You don't have to be that democratic do you doctor?
- Well I uh-
- We accept.
Paul you know you'll do much better work after you've had a nice, hot shower and slept in a honest-to-goodness bed.
- Well under those circumstances, how can I refuse?
It's settled then, shall we?
I must warn you doctor that you'll find rne an incurable dilatant,
I'm afraid you'll find me breathing down your neck, Mrs. Henderson.
Jim.
Doctor.
What's that?
Stop it Goro.
This belongs to Dr. Henderson.
It's your flare gun Paul.
I must've dropped it somewhere.
- And the poor fellow happened to pick it up.
You didn't give Bulon a chance t0 return it, Goro.
I hope G0r0's unfortunate display of temper hasn't spoiled your appetite.
Well he is a little different.
He's not as sinister as he seems t0 be.
Fact is, I wouldn't know what t0 do without him.
Appearances t0 the contrary, he would be a top overseer in any plantation.
Your property sir.
Thank you.
I didn't really expect t0 get lost on the island, but ground rules are ground rules.
- Just what do you expect to find here, doctor?
- This island was on the fringe of the atomic radiation area during the bomb tests in the late '40s.
Declared safe, then, as now.
- That's why I didn't expect to find any effect of the bomb tests on the flora and fauna of the island.
Didn't expect?
- I found a crab, an ordinary land crab that had undergone some kind of mutation, and also manifested a very high degree of radioactivity.
- Well couldn't it have migrated from Bikini or one of the other islands to the test area?
- Well assuming that it survived the bomb blast, that would seem like the logical explanation.
Migraine.
Have you found high radioactivity in any other creature on the island?
N0, not yet.
- Then Jim's explanation is probably valid.
- The trouble is, if any other living thing on the island has been affected by atomic radiation, only the crab would show evidence of strontium-90, not any other creature.
Why?
- When a crab molts, it eats its own shell, thereby reabsorbing its own radioactivity.
Well what about the other creatures?
- That would depend on inference or other evidence.
What other evidence Paul?
- You got me there, I really don't know, mutation, possibly.
Mutation?
- Inexplicable organic variations in animal of plant life.
- How long will it take you to determine whether any other creature besides the crab have been affected?
- A day, a month, depends on a lot of things.
- Could this mutation infect humans as well?
I don't know.
- Theoretically, doctor, would it be possible?
Theoretically anything is possible.
- Paul, Paul get it off of me please, Paul!
Paul!
Paul, Paul, help me!
- Come on, come on!
Oh Paul, Paul...
This way.
- Return to your homes there is nothing you can do for them.
Earthquake?
NO-
Paul.
- It's a tropical variety of the.
It's changing shape.
" Ow!
Paul!
Carla first aid kit, quick!
Take it easy I'm not hemorrhaging.
Paul, what's happening here?
- It seems that some living organisms on this island, are undergoing drastic mutation.
Please Mr. Farrell.
- We can't leave those women out there to be murdered.
There's nothing anyone can do for them.
They are dead even now.
- Please Jim, what my grandfather says is true.
- I'm prepared to stop you at all costs, Mr. Farrell.
Listen.
It stopped.
- Must be some way of stopping that animal.
It wasn't an animal Jim.
Well it wasn't a man either, so maybe it was an evil spirit huh?
Please don't be angry.
Are you serious?
Can anyone here be happy or okay, even resigned, to the idea of having himself and his entire family just wiped off of the face of the earth?
- The men survive this because it needs only women.
What do you mean?
What the devil do you mean?
He does not devour his victims.
He merely satisfies himself on them.
But they get torn to pieces.
It is his way of satisfying himself.
- Well come 0n.
- N0!
Can't say that I blame them.
- Paul, if that thing came out of the jungle, aren't we taking an awful chance that...
Well I'm even afraid to say it.
Powers' place is built like a fort, it'll be safer there for you, besides he isn't likely to go out of his mind with fear.
Come on.
Paul.
When we are, if we ever get back-
- Carla, you'd rather scare yourself into a fit if you don't watch out.
I'm not frightened now.
I was thinking of you.
About me?
Now that certainly sounds like a classic hysteria symptom.
- Paul haven't you ever thought of getting a divorce?
Have you?
I, what would I have to gain?
Wouldn't change anything for me.
A divorce would get me off your hands for good.
I don't think I'd contest it.
I just hate t0 feel that
I owe anybody anything.
Don't feel that way then.
- Oh Paul you're such an unbelievable stoic.
Why do you put up with me?
- I wouldn't lose any sleep over that if I were you.
I gave up on you a long time ago.
Sometimes I wish that were true.
What's the point of all of this?
You wanna see me wallow in self pity?
- It could be that, it could also be that in spite of what
I am there's a part of me that's still in love with you.
You couldn't possibly believe that could you?
It isn't easy for either of us, is it?
Paul.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I am sent to escort you, your bags.
- That's the same tree we saw here yesterday, but it didn't look at all like that.
Sometimes Dr. Henderson, the nighttime 0n this island is different to the eyes.
- It could be a lot easier to practice crop rotation with this new irrigation system.
I will tell them.
Sedition in the ranks?
- N0, a private joke, it has nothing to do with the work.
- Okay, let's get this work done huh?
Tomorrow we cut the closed poles for the bamboo network.
The bamboo poles for the closed network.
- However I did send a report through Captain Macbee.
- D0 you offer any opinions in these reports?
They expect me to.
What was your opinion?
That the recent killings may have been committed by a maniac.
A maniac?
A crazed, murderous sadist.
Also a man.
Assuming it was a man, possessing an unnatural degree of physical strength.
Those women were literally torn limb from limb.
Paul.
- Master, I am on my way to the wine cellar.
How about a little sherry before dinner?
- I'm sorry, I suppose I'll get used to him eventually.
- Come, we'll have a better view of the sunset over there, unmatched by any other sunset in the world.
It's beautiful.
I'm puzzled by this, Esteban.
Today's sunset is well, breathtakingly beautiful of course.
But otherwise, it's quite normal.
Yesterday the very air we breathed seemed to have a gloomy atmosphere.
- Like a mortuary light reflected from a corpse.
I'm sorry but that's the way I felt yesterday.
All in the eye of the beholder.
I've lived here practically all my life and I assure you
I've never felt that way, there as I said, unmatched by any other.
Alma?
Alma, Alma!
Look listen to me, look we can fight this thing, whatever it is, we can destroy it.
Look, just trust rne huh?
Just let rne go, I promise you you won't regret it, ljust wanna help you, ljust wanna-
Mr. Farrell, no!
- I don't wanna fight you Arcadio, but I will.
Jim, you'll endanger the village.
Jim!
~ Jim?
It's over you're safe now.
But you don't understand...
It's all right, come on.
Open up, open up, it's Alma!
Jim, they won't let us in.
Here.
They're gone.
They don't like what you've done.
Here put this on, hurry.
It's awful quiet.
- The evil has lifted, We can go to the jungle now.
You mean run away?
We'll both be killed if we remain here.
By who, your own people?
- They believe that the evil one will come back and that it's angry on the entire village.
- Then we gotta make
'em realize how foolish and dangerous it is to believe that.
Jim?
Stand back.
~ Jim?
I'm afraid.
- Why?
You'll be safe in that house, safe from the evil one, safe from your own people, come on.
- Welcome to the master's house, Mr. Farrell.
- We've come to accept your master's hospitality, if his 0ffer's still open.
Of course, this way.
Please, sit down.
- Hello Carla.
- Well hello indeed!
This isn't a social visit, is it?
Have you been a naughty boy Jim?
We defied the wicked spirits, we got the whole village chasing us, where's Esteban?
- He's not feeling well, he had some type of an attack last night, he calls it migraine.
Paul thinks it's epilepsy.
Is Paul asleep?
- Oh no, he'll be awake for the next three days, he's quite excited about the little monster he's captured.
- Hey Jim, wait till you see what I've got, come here, you've never seen anything like this in your life.
Carla tells me you caught a monster.
A cockroach straight out of H.G. Wells.
Well, a cockroach all right.
You should've seen this little beast, had horns and fangs, and even tried to attack a lizard.
You saw it, didn't you Carla.
Jim I did see it.
- Could somebody have substituted this one for the one
You've got?
- What on earth for, I was here all the time,
I only left the room just now to call you in here.
- Well maybe it mutated itself back to its original shape?
If that's possible.
I've seen it happen to a banana plant, even t0 the very air we breathe around here.
- If you do not mind sir, I shall show you t0 your rooms.
What about Alma?
There's a vacant room, next to yours.
Good come on, good night Paul, Carla.
Uh Goro what do you want?
- The master is not to be disturbed Mrs. Henderson.
- I uh, just wanted t0 know if he was awake.
- You're Arcadia's granddaughter aren't you?
Yes sir.
Please forgive me for intruding Mr. Powers.
You're most welcome here, Alma, for as long as you care to stay.
Thank you sir.
- Goro tells me that the villagers are after you, is this true?
- Yeah I seem to have offended the evil one when I cut her loose last night.
This is really quite terrible.
It's idiotic of me not to have a radio transmitter.
As it is we're completely cut off.
- Well what about those fishing boats out there?
The?
It's over 300 miles of rough and open sea t0 the nearest large island.
We haven't got big enough to make the crossing.
So we're trapped?
In the meantime this beast just continues t0 wallow in an orgy of blood.
Has anyone ever seen him or it?
I don't know of anyone alive who has.
I fainted just before he could get to me.
- I'm thinking of setting a trap for our monster, with the villagers' help.
- I doubt if you can even get them t0 come out of their homes right now.
- When I am ready I will just have to make them.
- Paul, please don't stray too far away from the house.
- Don't worry there isn't a monster a live who can outrun me, but I'll stay close.
I could keep you company if you're sure
I won't be in the way.
- Well I wouldn't wanna take you from your work.
Oh there isn't that much for me t0 do.
- Oh but Esteban you said you were gonna show me your wife's mosaics.
They'll still be there when we get back.
I do need to get out of house, Paul.
- Well I won't pretend
I wouldn't feel better having you around.
- You know I haven't used one of this in a long time.
Let's hope we don't need it.
And that, if we do need it, it can help.
Now here's another one that died before it had a chance t0 revert back to its original nature.
In your long experience Paul, have you run across anything like this before?
Never.
Even in circumstances exactly like this.
I can't even begin to form a theory until I have a pattern, for one thing, why haven't the people on this island been affected by mutation?
That's easy, they weren't on this island when the bombs were exploded on Bikini.
- You mean they were evacuated and then returned when the island was declared safe?
- N0, they'd never set foot on the island before the test.
They were sent from resettlement centers after the explosions.
- Then they couldn't possibly have been affected by the bomb tests.
- So you do tend to favor the notion that the tests had something to do with causing this mutation?
- For the time being, yes, but we don't have enough evidence t0 support the wildest theory.
She was an extremely gifted woman.
Strange, there's a very strong Spanish influence in her work.
Not so strange, she was a Spanish.
I'm half Spanish myself you know.
My mother's forebearers were the first Europeans t0 come to this island, first to settle here.
They established a rather important trading base, built this house, then my father came along and met my mother who was an only daughter, end of Spanish regime.
- But you were educated in the States weren't you?
- Not really, a couple of years of college.
Then I went t0 Spain, the
Royal University of Barcelona.
That's where I met Beatrice, my wife.
We were both very young.
But when the war broke out, everything seemed so-
- Wait a minute are you talking about the Spanish Civil War?
Yes.
That was 30 years ago.
So it was.
- But uh, that'd make you closer to 50 at least.
You're right again.
But that's incredible.
You don't look a day over 30.
Welcome to Shangri-La, my friends.
- If you'll excuse a rather indelicate non-sequitur,
Esteban what did your wife die of?
N0 one knows for certain.
She developed a fever, we flew her back t0 the mainland, but the doctors there couldn't do anything for her.
And then her complexion suddenly changed.
Changed, in what way?
Discolored.
She grew darker by the day, almost by the hour.
In spite of the fever, which she couldn't shake off, she seemed quite well otherwise.
Then one day, suddenly, she died.
She died in, in terrible pain.
The pain came all at once and simply overwhelmed her.
Forgive me my stupid curiosity.
- N0, please don't apologize,
I want to talk about it.
- Did your wife die within a year of the bomb tests?
I knew you'd ask me that.
It was our 15th anniversary when Beatrice talked rne into taking a vacation.
A cruise among the islands.
We had a 30 foot boat, no radio.
And we learned much later that we had come within range of radiation area.
But you weren't affected in any way.
I suspect all I got out of it, was this, this schoolgirl complexion.
Master?
It is time again for your medicine.
Esteban!
Jim, Jim wake up!
- What's the matter?
- Carla's missing!
Did you look around the house?
- Yes I've looked all over the house, I'm going out.
- Wait a minute wait a minute, look before we go stumbling out in the jungle in the middle of the night, did y0u-
I've looked in Esteban's room, he's not there neither is she.
- Is anything wrong?
- Carla's gone.
Sorry I woke you Alma.
You need not be, Mr. Henderson.
My flare gun's missing.
Here take this.
Stay close t0 me huh?
' Carla?
Carla!
- She can't go on any further, let's go back.
But what about Carla'?
- We don't even know where t0 start looking for her, we're just running in a panic.
" Jim!
Carla!
- Paul wait!
- Jim!
Carla, Carla?
Carla answer me it's Paul, Carla?
Carla!
Paul?
Dr. Henderson.
Where's Carla'?
- Return to the house, Dr. Henderson.
What have you done with my wife?
What have you done with her?
It is no use, you are too late.
He's coming back.
~ Jim?
Esteban?
I had an attack.
Epilepsy.
Woke up in the middle of the jungle and...
Who is that?
Paul, Goro killed him.
Goro'?
Are you sure?
We saw it happen Mr. Powers.
- I think I wounded him, he couldn't get very far.
I didn't expect this of Goro.
But now we've got to stop him before he can harm other people.
It's all right Jim, I think
I can manage by myself now.
_ Qkay-
Esteban!
I can't find my flare gun.
I slipped, hurt my arm,
I'm afraid we have to wait till morning.
Esteban we can't!
Look there's no telling what
Goro might do, even now.
I'm sorry.
Well let me take a look at it.
- N0, no!
- Jim...
_ Qkay-
Jim wait.
It seems to be coming from the house.
Yeah.
Well we can't stop now, at least Esteban's armed. we gotta figure out some way of reaching the village.
~ Jim?
Jim!
Alma?
Alma!
Leave me Jim, it's me he wants.
We're almost there, get up!
Master you are safe now.
The sickness will pass away as always.
Arcadio, Arcadio!
Lolo, Lolo open up!
Lolo we need your help.
- You have endangered your people twice already.
I must return you to your place at the altar.
" N0!
Now you listen to me, if we fight this monster together we can defeat it!
You say that once before!
Yeah!
And you did nothing.
You preferred t0 quake like frightened women here in your homes.
What can we do now?
Alma's in there, we gotta stop it!
Alma!
Has he come to?
Want to see him?
Will he live?
Can't tell yet.
I'd have called you.
Is he dead?
No, but still unconscious.
Three days already...
If he could be moved...
...we could use him now.
Could you keep anyone alive like that?
The experiment will kill him.
We need a healthy man.
There he is.
Will you talk to him?
I'd rather wait.
Has he seen anyone?
Doesn't want to.
Why not pick one of your men?
They didn't fit.
But why him?
He has nothing to lose.
Why not pick a convict?
We thought of that.
Has he chances of coming back?
There is no knowing it.
I'd like to meet him.
I'll call you.
You forgot your things.
I won't need them.
Claude Ridder?
Could you spare a day?
We're no policemen.
I'm from Crespel Research Center.
Never heard of it.
Nobody has.
I'd like to take you there.
Is it far?
50 km. we have a car.
How's the weather?
Sunny.
Then why not.
Want to go by your house?
Am I the man you want?
This is no kidnapping.
You'd get no ransom.
Is Crespel a town?
Not yet.
Is it pretty?
Not very.
Are you tired?
Of that question, yes.
They treated you well?
Why am I so interesting?
Can you smoke?
Cancer is my only worry.
Glad to be alive?
I'm not alive.
We're approaching.
You don't seem to care?
I've seen so many things.
Other may happen.
Like in fairy tales?
It isn't pretty.
But it's interesting.
I thought Crespel was a town.
There is one
3 miles away.
The boss will see you.
Surprised?
Frankly, yes.
We are supposed to do agricultural tests.
Actually we study time.
Have you solved it?
Partly.
Where do I intervene?
I have a question...
Answer it if you like.
You attempted suicide...
Has your mind changed?
Not for the moment.
You'd do it again?
I see.
You want me as...
...the ideal guinea pig.
Would have I chances of surviving?
100% if you were a mouse.
Let me show you.
Time passing?
I loved your idea of an agency
...to distribute time.
It wouldn't work.
Time might break down.
Nothing like writers...
...to have farfetched ideas.
Here are mice
A and B.
Are they alike?
Is one a female?
Both are males.
B is a pioneer.
A has never traveled.
B lived for one minute in the past.
A hero. When?
Yesterday. With no ill effects.
How do you know it really happened?
That's the problem.
He can't tell us.
You should have taught him to talk first.
You'll go back one year.
...into your past.
For one minute.
What if it kills me?
It won't with our treatment.
Where were you a year ago?
On vacation.
It took 3 months on the Riviera.
Are you sure?
I never forget vacations.
You'll be in a sphere.
At your return you'll wait for 4 minutes.
Why?
You'll be like a diver in a decompression chamber
Are you interested?
Why the past?
...instead of the future?
I see your point...
But we can't go further for the moment.
Only short trips.
Not even a little ulcer?
You're quite healthy.
Suicide is good for me.
I'll have to keep you here.
On a diet?
Sort of.
For 4 days.
Will I have to sign a release...
...before the experiment?
Possibly.
You could say I died in the hospital.
No doubt.
That's clever.
Was it your first suicide?
With a gun?
Guns don't fit you.
That's why I missed.
You are not afraid?
I've feared all my life.
But now I don't.
Do you sleep well?
No headaches?
Mind the effects of T. 5.
Doesn't seem to hurt you.
Now we just have to wait.
What if I stay for years?
It will last exactly 60 seconds.
Even mice can tell.
I won't wake up under Nero?
Lie down.
We'll close the door.
You'll come back here one minute later.
Disappointed?
A bit.
What if it fails?
It won't. You'll be back on September 5, 1966 at 4 p.m.
Why 4 p.m.?
We sent the mice at 4.
And they always came back.
It became a habit
Superstitious scientists!
Why did you pick me?
Our computer did.
Out of millions..
Naturally.
That's normal.
T. 5. makes you sleep.
I talk in my sleep.
And when you wake up?
I feel all right.
You'll have a larger dose.
...tomorrow.
You'll be drugged but perfectly lucid.
Will it fail if I move?
The subject must be passive.
...and semi-conscious.
Later
Two sea serpents and a few sharks.
That's about all.
Did you see many fish?
Two sea serpents and a few sharks.
That's about all.
Those gadgets make me mad.
You always say that.
Did you see many fish?
Let's go out for dinner.
Coming?
Later.
It couldn't end otherwise.
About 4 months.
How long will you be a shipping clerk?
As long as there's shipping.
You could do better things.
Hold a responsible position.
I hate responsibility.
I felt the same at your age.
Rich family?
Rather.
At your age I had debts.
Seen many fish?
2 sea serpents and a few sharks.
We've lost him...
...once again.
What time did she come?
At 9.
5,000 circulars to get out...
And she's done 90!
In four hours?
One envelope per 2 minutes.
It's a record.
Is she pretty?
The record-breaker.
In a way.
Send her in.
Even your car is a problem.
Shall we stop for lunch later?
If you like.
Something about Catherine bothers me.
Doesn't she care for you?
She's too quiet.
What did she do?
Nothing.
And now?
Nothing.
That's not much.
He's under the effect of T. 5.
5 times already.
I feared that transition period.
We can't get him earlier.
It can go on for days.
If we wait he'll starve.
Odd to see that from a heated train.
Was it cold?
Very cold.
Here's a town
I liberated.
We were about 50...
...facing 20 Germans.
Guns don't fit you.
Never got used to them.
Your name may be on a street.
It wasn't so pretty by then.
You didn't come Wednesday.
Come tonight, both of you.
You and Catherine.
We've separated.
After how long?
7 years.
Come alone then.
That dirty wall scares me.
The papers scare me more.
We should decorate your office.
...with a big picture...
...of an unpaid bill.
Or the kidnapping of commas...
...by a bookkeeper.
An eraser...
...and no pencil?
I love needless things.
Complements of the author.
Not very original...
I don't know these people.
A swimmer got drowned.
Is he dead?
He was a good swimmer.
Must have swum for hours...
...before he drowned.
Be quiet.
You treat me like...
...a stuffed owl.
But I move,
I see people.
If I didn't,
I'd kill myself.
The more I give you, the worse you get.
Since I can't help you...
...I am leaving.
It's 3 p. m.
3 hours to go.
3 minutes ago it was 3 p. m.
In 3 weeks it will be 3 p. m.
In a century too.
Time passes for everybody...
...but me.
It stays static.
It's 3 p. m. forever.
Hello... T.. I.. M.. E
It's exactly 3 o'clock,
0 minutes, 0 seconds.
All right...
...tomorrow at the same time.
Love to the family.
For 100 million years...
...algae and molluscs...
...and reptiles ruled the earth...
...till this firm was created...
I'm approaching death at full speed.
The earth will spin without me...
And I'm here expressing...
...our regrets to a customer...
...for the loss of his shipment.
A mouse? Here?
Were you talking?
I just saw a mouse.
A mouse on a beach!
It's on vacation.
We have succeeded!
He isn't dead.
A race against time.
Who's winning?
Don't know yet.
She's pretty, neat, moderate...
...things I despise.
You despise everything.
I like things that seesaw.
Do I seesaw?
Not at all.
You're spread out.
You're a swamp, mud...
- Gloomy -
I should wring your neck...
...or slowly slip into you.
Mona and her showcase.
You smell like drownings...
This beach is me...
I need you.
I needed you when they told me...
...of a girl who hated envelopes.
...and work.
Let's make love.
On the sand?
I'd run away to a land without nights...
Your wife has a cute bottom.
I'll tell you what you see.
You're by a window.
Everything is blue...
...the sea, the sand, the town...
Even people get blue...
Pretty girls already are...
I miss you Claude...
It both bothers me and pleases me...
It's the first time...
...I ever care about people.
There's a white sail...
...and some sea gulls.
Are there any on the Riviera?
They mean rain...
It never rains there.
We'll never finish tonight.
You're making errors.
It's always beautiful.
Not that sickening green.
Coming?
Later.
And if I'd been married?
I don't know...
It wasn't love at first sight...
It was different...
You didn't fit at office.
So I knew nothing mattered.
I might not have liked you.
I was so scared that night...
Why did you quit your job?
To impress you.
Were you making lots of money?
A living.
Your eyes are nice.
And I want you.
Shall we answer?
- No -
I love you.
Do you hear me?
I love you.
T'was the only reason.
Long before you died.
And now I'm dead.
I'm cold.
I hear my words.
It's the drug...
What are my chances of surviving?
100% if you were a mouse.
I am a mouse then.
They'll come now...
...in 4 minutes.
Where's the mouse?
You're delirious!
Unfortunately not.
Claude, please stop.
You scare me.
Don't mean to.
I killed Catherine...
...2 months ago.
I don't believe it.
You're right and wrong.
What do you mean?
I can't kill...
Yet I did.
Impossible.
I thought so too.
They should get rid of the streetcars.
Buses are just as bad.
Cars will be useless soon.
I'm sorry, sir.
If you take the streetcar...
...you'll miss your train.
Have you got time?
We'll have to sew the cat's eyes.
What?
We have a cat.
Are psychoses red?
The future is red.
And psychoses?
I get them mixed up.
Are you awake too?
Go to the office for me.
I need you.
I'm hard to live with.
I don't care.
I want to be with you.
Stay with me tonight.
Don't leave me.
I'm afraid...
...to find myself alone...
...tomorrow.
We could go to...
Last time he stayed a minute and a half.
Now he's been gone
3 minutes...
Unless he keeps reliving 1 minute.
T'would be better so.
I couldn't stay there.
Stay here, I'm going home.
Aren't you sleepy?
She'd be sad if you didn't come.
She's always sad...
...if I'm there...
If I'm not...
She's sadness in person.
You should be used to it.
I think of leaving her.
Nobody can help her.
She needs you.
That doesn't help.
Could you leave her?
Probably not.
I can't stand it.
I feel oxidized...
Once I left...
...for 2 days. She didn't care a fig.
You've had it.
She loved the sea...
...but got sad on the Riviera.
She loves the sun.
She hates sunlight.
You can't live with her or without her.
And so God said:
"Hope the earth'll turn".
You go to sleep.
I'm not sleepy.
You're not good at that.
I never write.
This job doesn't suit you.
No work does.
You've just earned...
14 francs. A pack of cigarettes
Won't be back after lunch.
How long did you hope to live...
...on this job?
A day... tomorrow.
Here's what we'll do...
I give you 14 francs...
And you ask me to lunch.
Why?
I don't want to.
You never buy anything.
I do. Bread, milk, matches, mustard...
Nothing for you.
Don't need anything.
Buy a sweater...
I've got 2.
No visits?
Don't want to see people.
Let's stay out all night.
We go to bed very late.
That's different.
You all right?
How was it?
Great.
Something's gone wrong.
What time is it?
They took my watch.
No watches for trip in time.
I couldn't count the seconds.
4 minutes make... one... two... three...
- No -
What kind of no?
Just no.
Because not yes?
You said yes!
She can sure say no.
Can't they tell?
I'm here!
They must know it!
I'm back!
I'm back!
Centuries have passed outside.
I've been forgotten...
We'll get him in three minutes.
Oh, there you are!
You're on a trip too.
Did you go far?
They can't get you back either.
We're both in a mess.
I know you.
You're the mouse
I saw on the beach.
You take trips in my past.
You don't have a watch either.
I have to get out of here!
I'll concentrate.
It's 10,30 you know
I feel awful.
Are you sick?
If Caterine had died, we'd know it.
It's so simple.
You heard about her.
But never met her.
Not many of my friends...
...really knew her.
You hid her.
People bored her.
She had family?
No, no cousins, no friends...
...no boss, no job...
Not even any papers.
No one will miss her.
People think we've...
...separated.
You left her there?
Why bring her back?
Why tell me?
Because nobody knows.
You let me caress you...
You say you love him.
I is, you am...
If I caress you...
...it's because...
...I'm lonely tonight.
If Caterine left me
I'd be thrilled.
I once knew a man...
You are not listening.
I'm listening to your fingers.
You've changed.
I'll never write again.
I know that song.
I'll show you something you'll like.
Is it big?
Tiny. You'll love it.
Animal, vegetable. astral or mineral?
Half and half.
I want to stay with you tonight.
What's wrong?
I'm terrified.
You are afraid?
Afraid means terrified.
Not in the least!
Try to read then.
Only one of my eyes wants to read.
You are absolutely...
...I don't know what.
I'm afraid too.
Of dying?
- No -
Never heard such a thing.
You still here?
Will you be out late?
Yes. He lives quite far away.
It's too hot in here.
Come with me.
I've called a taxi.
Glasgow is too gloomy.
Buy me some oranges.
What's the matter?
Can't you sleep?
I wanted the light on.
Come close to me.
Simple things are harder to understand.
Did you go to school?
Yes but I never listened.
But you read?
Books don't teach everything.
Claude told me the electric cable...
...kept the streetcars on the tracks.
I'd never thought of it.
I thought they ranon gas.
"The Martian Viewpoint".
Missed by two minutes.
It's as bad as two months.
T. 5. has worn off now.
Two many circulars.
Better write a new text.
You'll have it next week.
Let's say 5 days.
I'll be out by 25th.
How many pages?
40 more.
That will cost more.
Still can't send them till 17th.
B travelled 1 minute into the past.
A hero! When?
Yesterday.
With no ill effects.
How do you know it really happened?
That's the problem...
Never thought
I'd talk about that...
I'll go buy some cigarettes.
What are you doing here?
I couldn't sleep.
I was afraid I'd die.
So I came here.
At your return...
...you'd have found me dead.
...or sleeping.
I found a girl in the bathroom...
She was very sexy.
Everyman's dream.
Nothing happened.
I just washed her.
I dream about her.
We accolege reseat of your of the 2nd...
Happy to learn that you never deceived...
...our watchamacallit...
We'll fend you a new one...
...and cope it alives chafely...
Except our exclusives.
Yours, screwly.
I killed Catherine in Glasgow
2 months ago.
We needed it yesterday.
We can work all night.
He has no pencil.
He never has.
Does he know it's urgent?
He makes mistakes.
Can't spell "tomorrow".
It's late.
Isn't he tired?
Has he seen this spot?
Are you staying over?
You're right about this green.
Some are allergic to green.
It makes our cells wear out.
Scientists invent can openers...
...detergents, etc...
...without changing anything,
That's the secret.
And no one found it.
We'll give up salad...
Buy a boat. I'll learn to steer..
I'll find another reason to be sad.
I'm just a burden.
If I only had money...
Can't see you rich...
I'd pretend to be poor.
Oh! A tree!
...and a weed.
Field trees are rarer.
You missed my road sign.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Take this one.
It's better.
I'll tell them.
But the other one...
You got me my false papers...
Don't you know me?
I was called Rabois in 43.
I had false papers too.
You have a calcite.
Is it serious?
Not terribly.
You killed her all the same.
That'll be 90 francs.
Shall I come back?
Are you tired?
Why ?
I don't know.
Didn't you talk?
What about?
Nothing. I wasn't listening.
What do you want?
To eat.
I bought spinach.
- Grass -
I'd like huge herring.
I can't do anything.
In fact who are you?
Something blurred...
...more and more blurred...
I shrink in water.
What do you write?
I don't write much.
Shall we have lunch together?
It was a perfect crime.
I'll dress...
I like you all mauve.
What if God created the cat in His Image?
Then after some time...
...He created man...
...as a slave to the cat.
The cat got lucidity...
And man the passion to own.
No, you don't see.
Man was created for the cat's sake.
And his only aim is...
...to feed and comfort the cat.
He invented lots of things,
...only for the cat's profit.
Fishermen, cushions, radiators and the radio...
...for cats love music.
Glad to know why we are on earth!
So am I.
What is it?
A beetle.
What's wrong?
- Nothing -
Where's the car?
You slept with her?
Do you care?
Do you?
You are so superficial.
I dreamed of going away with...
...some inept employee of mine...
We'll go away...
...somewhere.
Then we'll come back...
Another coffee?
Why did you pick me?
Our computer did.
Out of millions.
Our oldest employee.
He's the computer.
He'll like that.
Buried all alone in that mud.
A guide to graveyards would be a best-seller.
Luceram cemetery.
One shinbone.
Others. Worth a detour.
No shinbone.
Avoid.
Rather live here than die here.
It only happens in books.
I don't mean to scare you.
I killed Catherine...
...2 months ago...
...in Glasgow.
I don't believe it.
You're right and wrong.
I can't kill.
Yet I did.
Impossible.
She hated Glasgow.
She was very depressed.
She was absolutely...
We haven't slept all night.
I'll be tired.
Let's try to sleep.
It's strange to wake up like this.
She was asleep.
And smiling.
Smiling for the first time.
She looked happy.
That's how it happened.
I looked at her.
29 minutes.
What shall we do?
We must try the impossible.
Are you Mr. Ridder?
Wiana went to the post-office.
Come in if you like.
We're in the bathroom.
Which one do you take?
The left one.
I'm Nicole. Can I take a bath?
Wash my back.
What do you do at the office?
Sometimes I think.
I pick up an object.
This pen is red...
But it writes black.
Deceiving appearances...
It's a very common...
...pencil.
It has a point...
...like a pencil.
It rolls like...
...a pencil.
If you hold it up...
...it's a tree...
...or a pencil.
I never use a pencil
Why have one?
Tables are meant for holding pencils.
- Go on. -
There are also erasers and paper.
We received 150 complaints.
...and 300 letters.
We're caught up.
He's replied to a letter we haven't got yet.
I'm absolutely exhausted.
It's going to be a nice day.
If people are up, it's...
Everything's ready.
Is it much?
5 whole years.
I'll be a few days.
When I'm with other girls,
I'm drawn to you.
Too bad you go to other girls.
I love you all the more.
That's why I'm sad.
Prometheus without his vulture.
I bought a chicken.
I can't get down to work.
Do something.
I keep watching the telephone.
What's she got?
Nothing.
But I want her.
I'd do anything for her.
Even send Catherine to hell
Well, call her.
I don't have her number.
All I can do is wait.
Let's not go home.
He's all right.
Quite still.
Let's stay some more.
I'll concentrate.
I have to find that minute.
I'm in the water.
Yhe sun's out...
Catherine is on the beach.
The water's warm...
I want to take a bath.
Sorry, I don't speak French.
Then where is Catherine?
After all...
Nothing...
Do you have to go?
I should.
Stay with me.
I can't find an excuse every day.
I'll help you find them.
You're already late.
Punctually late...
Never more than an hour.
Seen many fish?
2 sea serpents, some sharks...
Nothing's happening.
Nothing's changed.
I'm going to die.
Catherine...
...you were right.
I'd like to see the mouse.
He comes back more often.
For 30 seconds the last time.
That's not much.
A storm at 7 a. m. is unusual.
People get up early.
God... the workers...
You don't understand...
You're lucky.
One can bear a hard life...
Hoping things will...
...turn better.
To be happy...
...is much harder.
Because one knows...
...it won't last.
When one's hungry time drags...
3 months or 60 years to die...
One even adapts to cancer.
Choose something...
Carrots are good for the skin.
Spinach for influenza...
Fruits are a cure-all.
I can't help you.
I'm sorry I met you.
There was no escaping it.
Some wine?
Makes me sleepy.
Have you been here long?
We can work now.
We miss the documents.
Glad to see you, cat...
Did she feed you today?
Not much.
She's stingy.
Outside you had less to eat.
Must I starve here?
You exaggerate.
So that you believe me.
I don't like your records.
They're all alike.
I had friends outside.
We're your friends.
You're not so clever.
Sophie thinks we are.
What do you read?
What does that mean?
It bores me to explain.
I don't care.
It has nothing to do with me.
And you?
Nothing.
Then it's silly.
Depends on how you look at it.
I'm getting mixed up...
I quite like you.
You can't say that.
I can think it.
I used to wake up at night.
I hated it.
I stayed awake so as not to wake up.
But now it's over.
I sleep until morning.
I sleep well, don't I?
I often thought of killing her.
I believe it.
Do you?
I thought of what you said.
It's possible you've killed her.
And do you know why?
To end it all.
To end her suffering.
She was incurable, wasn't she?
The periods vary.
We can't do anything.
Then he's lost.
I went there to see a lawyer.
We were in a little hotel.
We turned on the gas heater.
She'd taken a sleeping pill.
She was asleep,
She was smiling.
For the first time.
She looked happy.
No longer afraid.
That's how it happened.
I was going out...
I smelled gas...
The gas was on...
I looked at her...
When I came back, she was dead.
The cops were there.
You must be lying.
Why didn't they arrest you?
It looked like an accident.
It was an accident.
I lied to see if you'd believe me.
The flame must have died out while I was out.
She really died there?
For a moment
I was glad...
...though it was awful.
She didn't suffer...
Then I realized...
...she'd gone for ever.
And I couldn't stand it.
It gets worse and worse.
What's wrong?
George is dead.
He died 8 months ago.
You knew it?
His wife wrote me.
You didn't tell me.
You were depressed.
Can you imagine a man...
...who, to spare his wife...
...would hide all bad news.
He'd hire actors to replace
...people who had died.
He'd put all newspapers...
...away from her.
He'd have to cover up the planet.
It would cost a lot.
It's ghastly.
What?
Everything.
Even when you're with me.
Page 8: put "Corriego" in italics.
Same page: you forgot...
...the word
"conjugated".
Page 9 is all right.
Page 14: no "c" in "solipsism".
Yes, it looks funny.
Page 12: "visual and tactile. "
More than an hour.
We'll never get him back.
His pulse is slow.
He's lost a lot of blood.
Can we move him?
Call the hospital.
We'll have to check our figures.
[MUSIC - "HOORAY FOR SANTA
CLAUS"]
NEWS ANCHOR (ON
TV): At this time,
Station KID-TV brings you the special event of the year, a first in television history.
At this very moment,
KID-TV has standing by a television crew at
Santa Claus' workshop.
And in just a few seconds, our special correspondent,
Andy Henderson, will bring you a person to person interview with Santa Claus himself, direct from the North Pole, where at the moment, the temperature is 91 degrees below zero.
And now KID-TV takes you via Telstar,
Andy Henderson at the North Pole.
ANDY HENDERSON
(ON TV): Hi, kids.
This is Andy Henderson at the North Pole.
Whoo, it's cold up here.
From this spot, there's only one direction you can go, and that's south.
Living up here is pretty rough.
I don't see how Santa stands it.
Since we've been here, we've eaten nothing but frozen food.
At least, that's the way it is by the time we get it.
And now, let's take a looksee into Santa's workshop.
Hello again.
Boys and girls, it's just weeks before Christmas, and Santa and his helpers are working overtime to make sure that there's enough toys for the kids all over the world.
Santa's a pretty busy man, but I'm sure he'd like to say a few words to you kids.
Hello, Santa.
SANTA CLAUS (ON
TV): Oh, hello, son.
Oh, well, hello boys and girls.
Hey... oh, Andy, you caught me at a very busy time.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): Well, uh, you think you'll be ready by Christmas Eve?
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Well, we've never disappointed the kids yet.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Tell me, is it true that this year, there's a rumor that you're going to use a rocket sled?
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): No sir-ee.
We're going out the good old fashioned way, with my reindeer... Prancer and
Dancer, and Donner and Blitzen, and Vixen and
Nixon... hey, Nixon?
Oh, where'd I get... Oh,
I always... confound it.
I get those names mixed up.
But the kids know their names.
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV):
Santa, there you are.
We have so much to do, and you stand here dawdling, talking to this visitor.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Mr.
Anderson, this is Mrs. Claus.
Uh, well, dear, we're on television.
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV): How do you do, Mr. Anderson.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Ma'am.
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV):
Now, I want you to go and finish painting those hobby horses.
Television?
Did you say we're on television?
Oh, oh dear.
Oh, why didn't you tell me?
Oh, my hair's a mess.
Mm-mm... H-hello there.
Oh, oh!
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Come along, Mr. Anderson, and I'll show you some of the new toys we're turning out.
How's it going, Winky?
WINKY (ON TV): Everything is A-OK, Santa.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Good man.
Winky is in charge of our space department.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Ah.
SANTA CLAUS (ON
TV): Oh, now here, here is the latest toy rocket.
It runs on real rocket fuel.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Really?
I've been wondering, what is this strange little creature over here?
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Oh, uh, Winky made that.
That's his idea of a Martian.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): A Martian?
Wow-ee-wow, I'd hate to meet a creature like that on a dark night.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Oh-ho-ho.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): I wonder if there really are people on Mars.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Well, who knows.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): Well, if there are, I hope they have someone like you up there, Santa, to bring joy and good cheer to all the Martian children.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Oh,
Mr. Anders... Ho-ho-ho.
Well, keep going, Winky.
Christmas Eve is coming soon.
Now Mr. Anderson, I want to show you some more things.
Now you...
Dropo?
Dropo, you lazy, good-for-nothing, where are you?
Dropo, Dropo, wake up.
Wake up.
[LAUGHING]
Oh, please turn off that tickle ray.
KIMAR: Stand up.
Stand up.
Stand up.
Stand up.
I'm sorry, Ki... Kimar, sir.
Dropo, you are the laziest man on Mars.
Why are you sleeping during working hours?
I wasn't sleeping, Chief.
It's just that I haven't been able to sleep these last few nights.
I forgot how.
So I was just practicing.
Well I suggest you practice doing your work.
Where's Lady Momar?
Oh, she went to the food pill center to get some new food pills.
The children haven't been eating well.
No appetite at all.
Oh, it's no wonder.
They sit in front of the video set all day, watching those ridiculous
Earth programs.
It confuses them.
Where are they?
Oh, in there watching
Earth programs.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Say,
Santa, what have we here?
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
These are new dolls.
Now, this little doll walks, talks, cries, and she even sings.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Almost like a real, live little girl.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): That she is sir, that she is.
All she needs is tender loving care.
Bomar, what is a doll?
I don't know, Girmar.
What is tender loving care?
I don't know, either.
Bomar, Girmar, I told you not to watch those silly Earth programs.
Now go to sleep.
Must we go to sleep now, Father?
I want to see Santa
Claus some more.
I want to see more toys.
No.
Go to sleep.
Hello, Dropo.
I see you're keeping busy.
Oh, I've been working very hard, Lady Momar.
I've been vacuuming the room.
Good.
Is the master here?
Oh, he's in there.
And Kimar is very angry, too.
Kimar, I bought some new food pills.
I hope the children will eat these.
We have hamburger, buttered asparagus, mashed potatoes, and a special treat for them, chocolate layer cake pills.
Momar, I'm worried about our children.
So am I. They've hardly eaten a thing in three days.
It goes deeper than that.
They're behaving strangely.
They appear to be troubled.
They don't care to sleep.
I had to use the sleep spray on them again.
I mentioned this to my council chiefs today, and I learned it's the same with children all around the planet, in every district.
Something is happening to the children of Mars.
Kimar, as the leader of the Martians, you must do something about it.
I know, but what?
Why don't you go to the forest and see
Chochem, the ancient one.
He'll know what to do.
He's never failed you.
You speak wisely.
I will go.
Attention, council chiefs.
Please report.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Lomas reporting.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Rigna reporting.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Hargo here.
Voldar?
Voldar, please report.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Voldar reporting.
Gentlemen of the council, we will meet immediately at Chochum's Chair in Thunder Forest.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON INTERCOM):
What's wrong now, Kimar?
I don't know, Voldar.
But I mean to find out.
Where's Kimar?
He should be here any moment.
What's this all about?
We'll find out when Kimar arrives.
We are probably going to seek the advice of Chochum.
What does Kimar think we are, a kindergarten class?
Can't we make our own decisions?
Must we always come crawling to that [INAUDIBLE] old man?
Chochum is 800 years old.
You can't dismiss the wisdom of centuries.
I can.
Gentlemen.
Thank you for coming.
Chochum?
Chochum, are you here?
Ancient One of Mars,
I call upon you.
Chochum, it is I, Kimar, and the council chiefs.
We need you, Chochum.
You called me, Kimar?
We need your advice, Chochum.
Something is wrong with our children.
They eat not.
They sleep not.
Their only interest is watching meaningless Earth programs on the video.
Wh-wh-what time of year is it now?
KIMAR: It is the middle of Septober.
No, no.
Not here.
I mean on Earth.
Ah, yes.
It is early December on Earth.
Close to the time of the Christmas.
That explains it.
What is a Christmas?
It is an occasion for great joy and peace on the planet Earth.
And for children, it is also a time of anticipation, as they await the arrival of
Santa Claus and his gifts.
Bah, what nonsense.
What has this to do with our children, Ancient One?
We have no children on Mars.
They have children's bodies, but with adult minds.
They do not have a childhood.
I've seen this coming for centuries.
They are born.
Our electronic teaching machines are attached to their brains while they are in their cradles.
Information is fed into their minds in a constant stream.
And by the time they can walk, they are adults.
They've never played.
They've never learned to have fun.
And now, now they are rebelling.
What do you advise?
The children must be allowed to be children again.
They must learn to play.
They must learn what it means to have fun.
We need a Santa Claus on Mars.
Santa Claus on Mars?
Where will we get a Santa Claus?
There's only one Santa
Claus, and he's on Earth.
Well, I guess that takes care of that.
Didn't I tell you it was a foolish idea to seek advice from that old man?
This is a serious matter, Voldar.
And desperate problems require desperate deeds.
Earth has had Santa
Claus long enough.
We will bring him to Mars.
I'm against it.
Our children are fine the way they are.
I don't want any Santa Claus bringing them toys and games.
They'll start playing and laughing and running under foot.
They'll become a nuisance.
I've made my decision.
We leave for Earth tonight.
Rigna, Lomas, prepare spaceship number one.
Approaching projected Earth orbit.
Fire port side rockets number one and number two.
Port side rockets number one and number two, fired.
Entering Earth orbit.
All right, Voldar.
Now to find Santa Claus.
Turn on your magnascope to third power.
We're over a city of some kind.
So that's what the Earth people call a city, eh?
How primitive.
Look at all those buildings above ground.
Why, we could destroy that city with one blast of our Q-ray.
We've not come here to destroy anyone.
Our only purpose is to bring
Santa Claus back to Mars.
Turn to fifth power.
Let's see if we can locate Santa Claus.
He wears a red suit, trimmed with white fur, and he has a long white beard.
But there are millions of people down there.
It's like looking for a speck of space dust in a comet's tail.
Wait a minute.
I see him.
I see Santa Claus.
I see him, too.
He's standing on the corner, ringing a bell.
No he's not.
He's standing near the entrance of a large building, next to a large black kettle.
He's standing on the corner, Kimar.
He's... wait a minute.
I see another one.
Why, there are hundreds of
Santa Clauses down there.
Are we going to bring them all back with us to Mars?
Just one.
And with so many, they won't miss one.
Prepare for landing on next orbit.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON
TV): We interrupt our program with a special bulletin.
An unidentified object has been spotted in orbit around the Earth.
The Soviet Union denies it has launched any new space satellites.
Our radar stations are tracking the spaceship, or whatever it is.
The US Air Force has alerted all defense commands and retaliatory units.
Sir, Earth radar beams are bouncing off our ship.
Well, it certainly took them long enough.
Voldar, turn on the radar shield.
Dysfunctioning of radar shield.
Rigna, check the radar box.
Radar shield functioning.
What was wrong, Rigna?
A slight case of Dropo.
Oh, hi Chief.
What are you doing here, Dropo?
Oh, well, Chief, I went to the launching pad so I could say goodbye to you, and I remembered,
I've never been to Earth!
So I thought I wanted to see...
I may leave you there in place of Santa Claus.
Now get below.
I'll deal with you later.
Dropo, get below quickly.
Yes chief.
Yes.
Yes chief.
I'm sorry.
Prepare to land.
We'll set down in that field near the lake.
Rocket silencers set.
Rotor rockets number one and two, fire.
All this trouble over a fat little man in a red suit.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): Here is another UFO bulletin.
The Defense Department has just announced that the unidentified flying object has suddenly disappeared from our radar screen.
They believe the object has either disintegrated in space, or it may be a spaceship from some other planet, which has the ability to nullify our radar beams.
Because of the ominous situation, the president has ordered the Strategic
Air Command into action.
[HORN BUZZING]
NEWS ANCHOR (VOICEOVER):
The Defense Department believes that the object spotted on our radar screens might have been nothing more than a meteor which burned up when it entered our atmosphere.
Professor [INAUDIBLE] Von
Green, our leading space expert, is still convinced it was a Martian spaceship.
Stay tuned for further bulletins.
Billy, what does a
Martian look like?
I don't know.
Nobody's ever seen one.
I don't believe there are any Martians.
You don't, huh?
What would you do if a Martian walked right up behind you?
I'd scream.
[SCREAMS]
Ah, stop doing that.
I'm trying to sleep.
I see a Martian.
Boy, you and your imagination.
Come on, let's go home.
Who... who are you?
We're from Mars.
Don't be afraid.
We have children just like you on Mars.
What are those funny things sticking out of your head.
Those are our antenna.
Are you a television set?
Shh.
Stupid question.
Is this what you want to do to our children on Mars?
Turn them into nincompoops like these?
Hold your tongue, Voldar?
What's your name, little boy?
Billy.
Billy Foster, sir.
And this is my sister, Betty.
Well perhaps you can help us, Billy.
We're looking for one of your Santa Clauses.
There's only one Santa Claus.
We've seen many of them in your cities.
Oh.
Those are his helpers.
There's only one real Santa Claus.
And he's in his workshop up at the North Pole.
That's what we came here to find out.
Let's go.
Come on, you two.
Let me go!
Where are you taking us?
Leave them alone, Voldar!
What?
And leave them here to inform the authorities?
He's right, Kimar.
We'd better take them along with us to North Pole.
Very well.
Come along.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): This morning, two children disappeared mysteriously in the vicinity of Welsh Lake.
The police have found no clues.
And it seems as though
Billy and Betty Foster have simply vanished into thin air.
This appears to be a day when everything is vanishing into thin air.
While local police are continuing their search for the missing children, the armed forces are continuing their search for the mysterious object from space.
All right, Billy and Betty.
Nobody here.
Come on in.
Golly.
Now, I'm not supposed to bring you here.
The chief's going to be awful mad if he finds us.
Boy, wait 'til the kids at home find that I was in a real
Martian spaceship.
No... no, don't touch anything.
Now, here.
That's the anti-gravity generator.
And these are the retro rockets.
Does this light up?
Only when radar waves are bouncing off our ship.
Then we put up this radar screen.
Then nobody can find us in space.
Boy, that's pretty sharp.
Yep.
What's this, Dropo?
Oh, that's the elevator signal.
That light starts flashing when somebody's coming up from the navigation deck.
Oh... oh, oh.
BILLY: Somebody's coming up.
We better get out of here.
No, no, no!
There's no time for that.
Oh, oh, I'm in trouble.
Oh, no time.
Here.
Here, here.
Quick.
Thinking of taking another nap in the radar box, Dropo?
Oh, oh, no sir.
As a matter of fact, I was just looking in there to remind myself never to hide in there again.
I bet.
No.
Approaching North Pole.
I can see Santa Claus' workshop.
Prepare for landing.
Hargo, set the rocket silences.
Dropo?
You stay aboard and guard those children.
They must not leave the ship now.
Now, or never?
What do you mean, Voldar?
If we take them with us to Mars,
Santa's disappearance would remain a mystery.
No one on Earth will ever know that Santa
Claus was kidnapped by Martians.
Perhaps you're right.
Dropo?
Yes sir?
Get back to those children, and don't let them out of your sight.
Understand?
Yes, sir I understand.
I... I'll keep an eye.
We've landed.
Secure the ship.
Lomas, you remain on guard and have the ship ready for immediate blast off.
Rigna, Hargo, Voldar, you'll accompany me.
Come.
We'll activate Torg.
Torg?
To capture a roly poly little man like Santa Claus?
We don't need Torg.
We won't take any chances.
Come.
Nothing can stop Torg.
They're going to kidnap
Santa Claus, and us, too.
Not if we can help it.
We've got to get out of here and warn Santa.
What's a Torg?
I don't know, but
I'm not afraid of it.
It's not going to stop us.
Come on.
Wait, Betty.
BETTY: Why did you do that?
If this ship ever leaves Earth, we'll have the whole US
Space Force after them.
Come on.
Wait a minute.
Come on.
BILLY: Come on, Betty.
This action must take place swiftly.
We can't afford to make any mistakes.
Hargo, you cover the rear of the workshop.
Rigna, Voldar, cover the front entrance.
I'll direct Torg.
Voldar isn't here.
Rigna, go up and tell Voldar... Voldar, this is another one of your delaying tactics.
You've been opposing me at every turn.
Now I'm warning you, change your attitude.
You finished, Chief?
Yes I am.
And you will be, too, if you're not careful.
Oh, but I am carefully, Chief.
So careful that I looked in at the children before I left the ship.
You stay away from those children.
That will be easy to do.
They've escaped.
Voldar, if this is your idea of a joke...
Ask Dropo.
They overheard our plans.
At this very moment, they're on their way to Santa Claus to warn him.
It's true, Kimar.
Their footprints.
We must stop them.
Those children mustn't reach Santa Claus.
Follow them.
I'll put Torg on the trail.
Torg, come out of the spaceship.
Torg.
Come out of the spaceship.
Billy, I can't run anymore.
I'm cold.
And I'm tired.
And it's beginning to snow.
Please, Betty.
Try.
We've got to warn Santa.
We can't stop now.
They might catch us.
Where is Santa?
BILLY: I don't know.
His workshop must be somewhere around here.
Betty, look.
It's Voldar.
BETTY: He's the mean one, the one who doesn't like us.
Come on.
Get back.
Don't move, Betty.
I'll go take a look.
It's all right now, Betty.
Come on.
I'm cold.
I wish it wouldn't snow.
That's the best thing that could happen.
It'll cover our tracks and be harder for the Martians to find us.
And it'll be harder for us to find Santa's workshop.
I'm scared.
We'll find it.
Which way is north?
I see it!
I see it!
Santa's workshop.
BILLY: Where?
Right there.
See the light?
Where?
The lights are moving.
They're coming towards us.
Betty, that's not Santa's house.
Wha... What is it?
BILLY: I don't know.
Good work, Torg.
Now destroy them.
Crush them.
Crush them, Torg.
Do as I say.
Voldar, I knew you'd try something like this.
I set Torg's controls so he will obey only me.
Release them, Torg.
You were very lucky.
Now don't try to escape again.
You may not be so lucky next time.
Hargo, take them back to ship, lock them up, and rejoin us.
You won't get away with this, you... you Martian!
The danger grows with every minute.
Let's get Santa
Claus and blast off.
We'll surround the workshop and send Torg in to get Santa.
Nobody is to be harmed unless they get in our way.
Right.
No one is to be harmed.
What has happened to the great warriors of our planet?
Mars used to be the planet of war.
Mark my words, Kimar, your softness will destroy us.
Santa Claus, toys, games, laughing children.
Well we shall see.
But for now, to your posts.
Torg, follow me.
Get him, Torg.
You can't come in here.
No one's allowed.
Well, where did you come from?
You're the biggest toy I've ever seen.
[LAUGHING]
And very well, made too.
By the great dog star, Santa's treating him like a toy.
Get him, Torg.
Grab him.
He's become a toy.
Rigna, we'll have to get Santa ourselves.
Come on, Voldar.
What have we here?
More toys?
Those are Martians.
Santa Claus, you're coming with us.
No.
You can't take him now.
It's too near Christmas.
Quiet, you.
But...
We don't want to hurt you, Santa Claus, so come along quietly.
Why... why did you have to do that to my helper?
It's harmless.
It'll wear off in a short while.
Oh.
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?
Now you come with us.
We need you on Mars.
Are you sure this is harmless?
Oh, I never saw such lazy people, standing around like statues.
There's work to be done.
Let's get to it.
Oh me, oh my, oh me, oh... oh, Mrs. Claus is going to be very angry about this.
Take him, Torg.
Torg, take him.
Obey my command.
Forget it, Kimar.
Rigna was right.
He's nothing but a toy now.
Best to leave him here.
Believe me, I had nothing whatsoever to do about this.
You know my dear, I can't recall a time when you were so silent for so long.
Let's go, old man.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): And Mrs.
Santa Claus has positively identified the kidnappers as Martians.
Never in the history of mankind have the nations of the world reacted with such unanimity and cooperation.
Tonight the lights will burn until dawn in the United
Nations building as the leaders of the world a map of course of action.
And at Cape Kennedy, our correspondent interviewed
[INAUDIBLE] Von Green, the man in charge of
America's Starshot program.
CORRESPONDENT (VOICEOVER):
Mr. Von Green, what is the space agency doing about this?
VON GREEN (ON TV): Well, they have mobilized all the men and equipment in our
Starshot project.
And we have rushed our astronauts into an intensive program for the final phase of their training.
Now, our Starshot ship is supposed undergo six months of test flights.
But we are going to forget about the testing and go after those
Martian monkeys.
CORRESPONDENT (VOICEOVER):
Isn't that risky?
VON GREEN (ON TV): Of course it is risky.
But every one of our astronauts is begging for the chance to go after the Martians.
Who wouldn't give everything to bring
Santa back to our children?
Earth hasn't reacted yet.
No radar beams being bounced off our ship.
Looks like we made a clean getaway.
[LAUGHING]
How's our captive?
He's having the time of his life.
He's such a funny little man.
Why, I've only been with him for five minutes, and he has me laughing just like an Earthling.
What's soft, and round, and you put it on a stick, and... and you toast it in a fire, and it's green?
I don't know, what?
A Martian-mallow.
That's what you're all becoming... Martian-mallows.
Soft.
Weak.
That old man is a menace.
Gee, Santa, it's all our fault.
We told them where to find you.
Oh, balderdash and a fiddle-dee-dee, Billy boy.
Everybody knows where Santa lives.
Besides, I've always wanted to visit Mars.
Mommy and Daddy are going to be angry.
You think that's something?
I can just see Mrs. Claus now.
Christmas coming, and I'm not there.
She'll have a fit.
Oh me oh my oh me.
Come and get it.
Dinner time.
Here's Dropo.
If I can't cheer you up, Dropo can.
He always makes me laugh.
Oh, you'll have a wonderful dinner tonight.
Oh, there's soup, and beef stew, and chocolate ice cream.
No thank you, Dropo.
I'm not hungry.
Come on, Billy.
Oh.
Well, is it all right if I have your chocolate ice cream?
Sure.
Oh, I just love chocolate ice cream.
Kimar, look at this.
That small blip is not an asteroid.
It's a spaceship, and it's on our tail, getting closer.
Impossible, Rigna.
They couldn't have spotted us.
We have our radar shield on.
I know that sir, but they are gaining on us.
Is it possible Earth has a secret device that can penetrate our radar shield?
They have a secret device, and his name is Billy Foster.
I warned you that these
Earthlings are dangerous.
They'll destroy us if we allow them.
Well I won't allow them.
I think we underestimate the resourcefulness of these Earth people.
Very clever of the boy.
Make the repairs, Rigna.
I'll take evasive action.
Well.
And how is Santa, and the little Earthlings.
My, it must be tiresome cooped up in this little room.
Say, how would you like to see the rest of the ship?
You're not fooling me.
You don't like us.
You're mean.
Oh, come on now.
That's not true.
Why, Santa makes everyone feel good, even me.
I don't trust you.
Now, now, Billy boy.
That's not the Christmas spirit.
Why, of course, Voldar.
We'd love to take the grand tour.
All right, children.
This room is called...
Airlock.
That's right.
Sure.
This is where you come when you're ready to go out in space.
It's airtight.
You put on your space suit, and go out through that door.
When you come back, the door closes, and they pump air back into the room through there.
When it reaches the pressure of the rest of the ship, you can take your space suit off.
Smart lad.
Well, where's the control that opens the door [INAUDIBLE]?
Not here.
That's in the control deck.
You see, once you pull that switch, the warning bell sounds, and in 60 seconds, that door opens.
Santa, that clock stopped.
60 seconds.
That must be the door timer.
Santa, he locked us in.
Oh, I don't think so.
He probably just stepped out for a moment.
It's locked.
I don't trust Voldar.
He's not like Kimar and the others.
I don't like him.
I'm worried, Santa.
Now, now, children, let's not get excited.
It's Voldar.
He's going to open the space door.
Help, Kimar!
Kimar!
Help!
Gee, Santa, what are we going to do?
Once that door opens, we haven't got a chance.
Eh.
Where'd you say this leads to, Billy?
VOLDAR: Seven six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.
Who's in the airlock?
No one, now.
What's going on, Voldar?
Oh, Chief, Santa and the children are missing.
Where are they?
Drifting around in space, along with the rest of the space junk.
Before I'm through with you, Voldar, you'll wish you were floating around out there in space.
[LAUGHING]
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Santa Claus, you're all right.
I... I thought you were...
Well, when Voldar accidentally left in the airlock, and then came up here and accidentally threw the door switch, we knew we had to get out of there in a hurry, or that would be the end of us...
Eh, accidentally, of course.
So we crawled up through the air duct.
The air duct.
But the air duct is just a little, and... and you're so big.
[LAUGHING]
Well, you're talking to Santa Claus, son.
KIMAR: But, how...
Well, well now, you wouldn't want me to tell my secret, would you?
[LAUGHING]
Oh... oh, oh, poor man.
He's fainted, just like someone who's seen a ghost.
KIMAR: Begin landing operation.
CREW: (SINGING) Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.
Uh, Merry Christmas, Voldar.
[MUFFLED SQUEAKING]
All right, on your feet, come on.
Dropo!
Oh, whoa... I was handing him food pills through the bars, and he grabbed my wrists...
Shut up, Dropo.
Kimar, come in quickly.
Kimar?
Yes, Rigna?
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
Voldar has escaped.
What?
He's gone.
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM): That can only mean trouble.
Put a constant guard on
Santa and the Earth children.
Voldar will be back.
Oh, Kimar.
Are you alone?
No.
MOMAR: Well.
KIMAR: Earthlings...
Billy and Betty.
Welcome to our home.
There's someone else, too.
Oh?
Come on.
Come on in.
Lady Momar.
I'm not accustomed to entering people's homes through the door, but you have no chimney.
Welcome, Santa Claus.
We hope you'll make the children on Mars very happy.
I'll try, dear lady.
I'll try.
Where are they?
KIMAR: Well, we'll start with my youngsters.
How are they, Momar?
MOMAR: The same.
Quiet, remote, and very unhappy.
They're inside, studying.
Well, let old Santa say hello to them.
And I'm sure these children would like to meet them.
I'll tell them you're here.
COMPUTER: Y over 5 pi r squared to determine the correct orbit from Mars to Jupiter, traveling along Vector
A through the 17th quadrant at the power of 12 megatrons.
Father!
Father, we missed you.
I missed you, too.
Children, I brought some visitors from Earth.
Will you come in please, children?
Billy and Betty, this is Bomar and Girmar.
Hi.
There's nothing in it.
What are you giving me?
My hand, to shake.
How old are you?
I'm 10, too.
And Girmar's eight.
So is my sister.
We have another Earth person that wants to see you.
What's that?
They're laughing.
Bomar and Girmar, too.
They've never laughed before.
Come.
I can't believe it.
That's the first time in months they've gone to sleep without the sleep spray.
Santa, tomorrow we'll set up a workshop for you.
It won't be exactly the same as the one you have on Earth, but I'm sure it'll serve your purpose.
Good, good.
Now, I'd like to get going and have the toy shop operating full blast, so as I can return to Earth for Christmas.
You know, Mrs. Claus is a very good-natured woman, but...
Santa Claus, you will never return to Earth.
Wha...
Now you belong to Mars.
Ho, ho, ho.
Well, we've no time to lose.
We must go into action.
Now we cannot eliminate Santa Claus, but we can just discredit him, make him a laughingstock throughout Mars.
Come on.
Now listen, carefully.
That workshop closes at 10 o'clock.
The guards will be at Kimar's house, guarding Santa Claus.
Now this is what we'll do, see?
You take...
Two dolls.
Two dolls.
Yes, Betty.
BETTY: Three baseball bats.
Three baseball bats.
Look at me, Santa Claus, the great toymaker, pressing buttons.
That's automation for you.
Technology, oi.
Well, that's enough for today.
Let's close up shop!
OK, Santa.
OK, Santa.
Boy, we sure did a lot today.
SANTA CLAUS: Yes, well, there's another day gone, children.
As they say on Earth, another day, another dollar.
Well, hello, Santa.
How are you feeling today?
Tired?
No, no.
I'm not tired.
But my finger is.
It's been pressing buttons all day long.
Well, I think I'll go in and put my finger to bed.
Here, children.
Here's your milk.
You can play for half an hour, and then you'll have to go to bed.
Daddy, may we watch the Earth program?
Certainly, dear.
But only for half an hour.
Billy?
Betty?
Don't you want to watch the Earth programs?
Oh, no sir.
We're not interested in Earth programs.
I'm going to sleep.
Goodnight.
Me, too.
Just a moment.
Goodnight, Mr. Kimar.
Goodnight, Lady Momar.
Just a moment, children.
Are you feeling well?
Oh, we feel fine, sir.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
KIMAR: Has someone been mistreating you?
Oh, no sir.
You and Lady Momar have just been swell to us.
Goodnight.
What could it be, Momar?
They're behaving the way our children used to behave.
Can't you tell, Kimar?
They're homesick.
They miss their parents, their friends.
Kimar, you've got to send those children back.
Impossible.
Oh, now I'm Santa Claus.
Ho, ho, ho.
Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas everyone!
Ho, ho, ho.
My finger isn't tired.
I think I'll go down to the workshop and make some more toys.
Ho, ho, ho. (SINGING)
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
[HUMMING]
VOLDAR: Shim, pull the light.
No, the light.
Oh, ah, this is going shake 'em up.
These toys will never be the same again.
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Someone's coming.
Quick, down.
(SINGING) Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride the one horse open sleigh, hey.
What a break.
It's Santa Claus.
He's alone.
No guards.
(SINGING) Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride... oh, oh, oh.
Now stay put, my fat little friend.
Hey, Santa.
How do you like this toy?
Ho, ho, ho.
My friend asked you a question.
Answer him.
Ho, ho, ho.
Quiet, Shim.
Put on a nuclear curtain.
Tomorrow marks the end of Operation Santa Claus.
And Mars returns to normal.
Dropo, we're here.
He's hiding, Santa.
Oh, playing hide and seek, eh?
All right, Dropo.
Here we come, ready or not.
He's not here, Santa.
That's funny.
Oh, well, he'll turn up.
Let's get started.
Hey, ho!
Ready?
OK.
Let's go.
One teddy bear and one doll.
One teddy bear and one doll.
Santa, stop the machine!
Look!
The doll has a teddy bear's head, and the teddy bear has a doll's head.
I can't understand it.
Oh, let's try it again.
What's next, Betty?
One baseball bat.
SANTA CLAUS: A baseball tennis...
Why, this will never do.
The machine isn't working right.
Oh, dear.
What else, Betty?
A toy train.
A toy train.
Well, all right.
Yes.
Look at that.
Wha... Why, this doesn't make sense.
Well, this never happened when we made toys by hand.
Something very strange is happening here.
Bomar, I think you'd better call your father.
Father?
Father, this is Bomar.
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM): Yes, Bomar?
Father, we're in the toy shop.
Dropo was in here, and there's something wrong with the toy machine, too.
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM):
I'll be right over.
Just a word of warning.
If you got any big ideas, forget them.
If you walk through that nuclear curtain, you'll be disintegrated like that.
Sabotage Somebody switched all our wiring.
Dropo's gone.
Your suit is missing.
And now, this machine's been sabotaged.
Put them all together, it spells Voldar.
He was here, and he thought Dropo was me.
He's got Dropo.
And I've got to find him.
Poor Dropo.
Surprised to see us?
You're under arrest, Voldar.
Stop playing with toys.
Put it away, Kimar.
We have a weapon that's much more potent than that.
As you may know, we are holding Santa Claus a hostage.
One false move, and your little ho, ho, ho man will be destroyed.
All right.
What do you want, Voldar?
These are our terms.
First, destroy the toy machine.
Second, we will release Santa Claus if you promise to send him and the Earthlings back to their planet.
Third, no more joy through toys nonsense on Mars.
Well?
Well, you win.
Are you sure you have Santa Claus?
VOLDAR: You know we have him.
You mean you had him.
How did he get out of the cave?
Shim, that idiot!
A-a-and how'd he get here s-s-so fast?
Santa Claus has powers that you don't know about.
All right.
Arms up.
Rigna, Hargo, Lomas, report.
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
This is Rigna, Kimar.
Hargo and Lomas are with me.
Good.
I've got Voldar and Stobo.
I'll keep them here in the storeroom of the toy shop.
Rigna, you come here and take them off my hands.
I want Hargo and Lomas to look for a man named Shim.
Tell them to search the caves along the Transverse Canal.
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
Right, Kimar.
All right, you two.
In there.
All right, you might as well relax.
You're going to be here for a while.
Sit down.
SHIM: Where are you going?
Ho, ho, ho.
Can't you say anything else but ho, ho, ho?
DROPO: Ho, ho, ho.
If you're thinking of leaving,
Santa, let me remind you.
Once you hit that nuclear curtain, there won't even be a whisker left.
Ho, ho, ho.
SHIM: Hey, Santa!
Be careful!
What are you going to do with us?
You're going to stand trial before the council.
I don't think you'll be causing any more trouble.
Well now, I think that should do it, Billy boy.
Close the door, son.
Now, I think we need a little red paint.
And you'll find it in the storeroom.
Sure, Santa.
Yes.
That's a good boy.
VOLDAR: This time I'll take care of Santa Claus for good, and smash that machine.
Santa!
Santa!
Voldar and the other man are in the storeroom, and they're coming to get you.
Oh, they are, are they?
Yeh... well, maybe they'd like to have some fun with our toys, and we'll see that they do.
Won't we kids.
Oh-ho, we meet again, eh?
I don't know how you escaped
Shim, but you won't escape me.
You're through.
Voldar, why don't you, uh, relax?
You're going to relax... permanently.
You?
Wha... but, you're not here.
You're in there.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
I'm not here.
I'm in there.
Wait a minute.
I'm going to see who
Voldar's fighting in there.
What happened?
I don't know what's going on in there, but I'm going to take care of you myself.
Now... now, just a minute.
Now I'd like to talk to... Oh, boy,
Chief, am I glad to see you.
All right, inside, Stobo.
All right, kids, you can stop now.
I said cease fire.
All right, Rigna.
Take them away.
They've had a rough day.
Ho, ho, ho, everybody.
Merry Christmas!
You don't need me here, Kimar.
You've got a wonderful
Santa Claus of your own.
Ho, ho, ho!
Goodbye, Billy.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Betty dear.
You take care of yourself.
Bye.
I've got something for you, Billy.
Gee, thanks.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Gee, we had fun.
We're going to miss you.
Do you think we'll ever meet again?
I'm sure you will, children.
Thank you, Santa, for bringing happiness to the children of Mars.
And the Christmas spirit to all of us.
Son, from the bottom of my heart,
I wish you and yours the very best of everything.
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas, everybody!
Dropo Claus is here.
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!
Dropo, you put on weight.
Oh, yes.
No pillows, look.
Look kids, no pillows.
Now, if we hurry, we can get back in time for Christmas Eve.
KIDS: Yay!
Shall we get going?
KIDS: Yay!
Goodbye, dear friends.
Away!
Merry Christmas, everyone!
Away!
MARTIANS: Bye!
Goodbye, Santa Claus!
Goodbye!
[MUSIC - "HOORAY FOR SANTA
CLAUS"]
Let me die.
Let me die.
I should've known he was as good as dead when they wheeled him in.
You did everything possible, everything you could, Dr. Cortner.
Everything?
Everything except save my patient.
Everything in the books.
Now, Dad, do I have permission to take over and try things my way?
The operating room is no place to experiment.
He's dead, I can't do any harm.
Very well.
The corpse is yours.
Do what you want to do.
All right.
Make an opening into the chest cavity.
Apply 100 milliamps of current directly to the heart, then massage by hand.
I'll handle the brain area.
- By yourself?
- By myself!
I've got to work fast, if it isn't too late.
You talk as if he's still alive.
He is!
I just picked up a faint pulse beat.
Keep massaging the heart.
I am, I am.
These electric shocks should stimulate the motor area enough to enervate the heart again.
Then he won't need any external stimuli.
Keep away from the motor area.
You'll paralyze him for good.
Which would you rather be:
Paralyzed or dead?
Don't try to play God.
Some choices are not yours to make.
When the obstetrician has to decide which to save, the mother or the child, who plays God then?
- It's part of the game.
- The game?
The human body is not a jigsaw puzzle to experiment on.
Still playing it safe like the other doctors, hmm?
Might as well save my breath.
Keep massaging the heart.
You've already lost your patient, doctor.
I'm going to save mine.
His pulse is coming back stronger than ever.
It's unbelievable.
Nothing is unbelievable if you have the nerve to experiment.
I've been working on something like this for weeks. In your laboratory?
I knew this would work, if only I had the opportunity...
You don't conduct experiments on people.
You should be sure of the results first.
I am now.
Stop massaging the heart.
Let's see if it can take over by itself.
All right.
Close up the chest.
I'm about finished with the cerebral area.
How's his pulse?
Strong and steady.
Yeah, you did perform a miracle.
I may not approve of your methods but...
I am proud of your results.
That was an amazing...
Even an extraordinary operation, son.
But it still is too risky.
Too uncontrolled.
Saved his life.
And the aftereffects, what about them?
You've lost the urge to experiment.
To explore.
You don't explore on people.
Before you put a scalpel to one, an operation like this needs testing under every condition.
Over and over again.
Rabbits, mice, monkeys!
Not people!
That man who should be dead now won't think so.
There's more to surgery than just being a carpenter to patch up walls.
Or a plumber to drain pipes.
Our bodies are capable of adjusting in ways we've hardly dreamt of.
If we can only find the key.
I'm so close now, so very close.
The key to what?
Complete transplantations.
To be able to transplant limbs and organs.
To be able to replace diseased and damaged parts of the body as easily as we replace eye corneas now.
So that the new parts will join together as though they were born there.
It can't be done!
It can be done!
With my new special compound
I've created, I'll do it, I know I can do it!
Sure, sure, that's what you say!
That's what I know!
I know I'm close!
Darling, I'm so proud of you
I could kiss you!
Promises, huh? Always promises.
Careful, your father is liable to report us.
And stop the floor show?
When you two are married it won't be fun to watch anymore.
Well, I can promise you one thing.
Your grandchildren won't be test tube babies.
You better hurry if you wanna catch that plane to Denver, Dad.
And you know that medical convention can't start without you.
Um, Jan, you'd better check about my reservations.
Oh, yes, I'll call the airport.
I'll be right back.
Bill.
The line between scientific genius and obsessive fanaticism is a thin one.
Now I want you on the right side of it.
If I don't experiment, how can I hope to perform operations like the one you almost messed up?
But I can't cover up for you anymore.
The superintendent had it out with me.
He thinks it's you who's been stealing those limbs from the amputee operations.
So what if it is?
I've got to have limbs for my transplant experiments.
Well, you said test and experiment, test and experiment!
Yes, but limbs and organs taken from people!
I've got to have them to work with.
Sure, I've made a few mistakes.
But I've learned from them, I've learned!
Your reservations are all set,
3:30 take off.
Well, what have you two planned for the weekend?
Oh, nothing much.
Just a quiet weekend.
Are you sure you're not going up to the country house?
You're always sneaking off up there.
That place gives me the creeps,
I should've sold it when your mother died.
You can't sell that place!
I mean it's nice to get away from the city,
I can work without anyone snooping around.
You spent too much time up there.
All right, I'll see you both in a few days.
I've got to clean up and get out of here.
Fine operation or not, Bill, you're walking on thin ice.
But don't go too far!
Oh, every time you touch me,
I go out of my mind.
I wanna kiss you.
Bill, I wanna get married,
I can't stand not having you!
You've been wonderful!
Oh, I'd rather be a bride.
In a few more weeks.
Then nothing will keep us apart.
We'll be together.
Dr. Cortner!
I'm so glad you're here.
I was afraid you'd gotten away.
There is a very important phone message that came to you, it sounded quite urgent.
I have been looking everywhere.
It was from a man called Kurt.
He called from the country place, and he said something terrible had happened, and he wanted you to come right out.
Thank you.
Well, you've always wanted to know what's kept me away from you so many weekends.
Have you got the keys to your car?
Why haven't you ever taken me up here before?
Because the things I'm working on don't need an audience.
That telephone call, what about it?
All right, all right, hold off the questions.
Why the mystery, Bill?
What's this all about?
We'll be there soon enough, you'll see.
I've got to hurry.
Kurt? Kurt!
- All right, all right!
- For God's sake open the door!
I'm coming!
What's the matter?
- What's happened to you?
- There's been a terrible accident.
I've got to save her,
I've got to save her.
What is it, what have you got there?
Kurt, please! Sterilize the tubes and instruments, quickly!
Well, what are you going to do? Aren't you going to have a look in the closet first?
- Oh, I can't now, this is more important.
- But you don't understand!
For God's sake, Kurt, this is urgent, do as I tell you before it's too late,
I can't waste precious time arguing with you!
The eyelids!
I saw them move!
It can't be!
My eyes are deceiving me.
What you see is real.
What's done is done and what I've done is right.
It's the work of science.
I remember...
Fire.
Burning.
Let me die.
Let me die.
I've had success with transplants, now I can do it for her.
Transplant her onto what?
I brought her back, she'll live, and I'll get her another body.
I can make her complete again.
Only a madman can believe that she could ever be like before!
Don't argue with me.
I love her too much to let her stay like this.
I'll restore her as before.
You'll see.
Can't you realize?
Can't you see?
There's a pattern to all that lives!
An order, an arrangement.
She had a heart, and a brain, and her spirit was in both, not in one or the other!
No.
I'll give her a brain and a heart.
Yes, and what of her soul?
You say you love her and... you can remember her love for you.
Then how can you make of her an experiment of horror?
All the skill and science
I possess was meant for this.
Life has a pattern.
The whole pattern of my life is shaping itself to save her now.
- Then you intend to go through with it?
- Yes.
Sleep, my darling.
Rest and grow stronger.
How long do you think we can keep her alive under these conditions?
48, 50 hours at the most.
Yes.
And you really believe you can work a transplant on her?
Successfully?
Yes.
Like my arm?
Withered and deformed.
Yours was an early experiment that failed.
With her I'm using my new Adreno-Serum.
It must work.
I... I've got to go now.
If the police, or anyone, call, tell them you don't know anything about it.
I don't think anyone will trace us here because her body was burned in the wreckage.
Yes, yes, of course, of course.
Look, Bill, before you go, do have a look in that closet.
It's the reason why I called you up here.
Keep it locked!
Last night it go so violent, it almost broke out!
Oh, no, not through that thickness.
Keep it closed.
I've got to think about her now.
I've got to find her a body.
How are you going to go about getting one?
Bill, how will you do it?
There are ways.
There are ways.
What took you so long?
What made you think I'd come?
You know a good thing when you see it.
Yeah, there was plenty to see.
I liked your act.
Is that all you liked?
Well, your costume, what there was of it, was interesting.
Is that all?
The rest of the equipment is standard.
But, uh, the arrangement is pretty special.
You're no tourist just looking at the sights.
What are you doing here, slumming?
Oh, I get my allowance once a week.
Okay, if you're so loaded, you pay for the drinks.
I already did.
Are you hustling for the house?
I hustle for myself.
I'm the leading lady around here,
I can sit with the squares out front or I can relax back here with my friends.
I'll bet you you don't have an enemy in the world.
Let me die.
Let me die.
Where are you from?
Oh, around.
Just looking around.
When you get done looking, then what?
I operate.
I get your message, you're coming across.
You could flip any chick in the house, why me?
Well, like I said, I'm looking.
Well, you don't have to look any further.
I'm not gonna fake it for you.
When do you go on again, huh, when?
Relax, I got another show yet.
But it could be for you.
Oh, I was just asking.
Try taking.
Are you getting nervous?
I'm over 21.
Oh, it isn't that, it's...
I've just got things to do.
Things to take care of.
Well, if that's anything that makes you sick what could be more important that could be taken care of right now?
Oh, I've, uh, I've got to see about helping somebody.
Somebody who needs my help very badly.
You can't cut out on me now, baby.
Not when you've got me feeling so good.
I'm so warm all over.
I'm good for you.
I know I'm good for what you want.
You may be just what I'm looking for.
You've got your nerve.
Oh, look who's talking.
Why don't you haul your beat-up body back to the bar with the rest of the flies?
Keep your g-string on.
I only came in here to change my clothes.
I got admission.
Now I'd like to see the rest of the show.
Come back in half an hour and maybe you will.
Get lost.
Hi, loverboy.
I see you've met the queen.
Hey.
Come here, don't hide.
You know you've got the kind of face a girl doesn't mind looking at.
Even out front all the other girls were asking about you.
Get out of here.
Two's company, three's a crowd.
Who's to tell me to blow if I don't want to?
This here is my dressing room too, remember?
It kills her to see me make time.
You're the only thing that's going to be made around here tonight, honey.
Eat your heart out.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
Yeah, well, uh, I'd better be going, hmm?
What for?
Look what you've done! You come busting in here with your two cents.
Let me see you later.
I'll make everything up to you,
I swear I will.
Yeah, come on back later.
I'll remember you.
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
You lousy tramp.
Once in a blue moon I latch onto a guy with class and you mess it up.
Eh.
What makes you think you had him?
He wouldn't have you on a bet.
- Says who?
- Says me.
What's a guy like that want with leftovers for?
Leftovers?
Why, you cheap third-rate stripper!
Let go!
- There.
- No!
I'll mash you like a bug.
- Don't you cry.
- Watch out.
You.
Inside the closet.
What has he done to you?
I know there's someone there.
Knock once if you hear me.
Then I'm not the first.
Knock twice if I'm not the first.
He should've let me die.
I hate him for what he's done to me.
If he only knew what it's like being like this.
Do you know what it's like?
Together we could have revenge.
You want revenge?
Yes.
You the thing inside, and me the thing out here.
My brain is still untouched.
And his keeping me alive has given me a power he didn't count on.
A power that you can feel.
Across this room and through that door.
Can't you?
Together we're both more than things.
We're a power as hideous as our deformities.
Together we'll wreak our revenge.
I shall create power and you will enforce it.
You, the thing inside.
Me, the thing out here.
What's locked behind that door?
Horror.
No normal mind can imagine.
Something even more terrible than you.
No, my deformed friend.
Like all quantities, horror has its ultimate.
And I'm that.
No.
There is a horror beyond yours, and it's in there.
Locked behind that door.
The paths of experimentation twist and turn through mountains of miscalculation and often lose themselves in error and darkness.
Behind that door is the sum total of Dr. Cortner's mistakes.
He had no right to bring me back to this.
Perhaps not. Who knows?
But you should know... that before he injected the serum into that, it was but a mass of grafted tissues.
Lifeless.
It just lay there, weighted down with its transplants of broken limbs and amputated arms.
But with this serum, it began to breathe.
That's impossible.
Would you have thought possible what he has already done?
Take yourself.
He has brought you back.
You live!
And only a few years ago, all transplants were impossible.
That's what he's been doing up here where no one could see his work?
Yes.
Experimenting with transplants on that... and on me.
Letting him tear away my flesh time after time, test after test.
My hopes shattering with each grafted arm he fastened to me.
Watching it wither and warp.
Instead of strengthening.
Now you see, he's learned from his mistakes.
And you stayed with him.
Helping him in his grotesque work that he claims is for science.
Was there a place for me on the outside with this?
In a world where eyes would look upon me with pity and people would turn away from me in disgust.
No, the alcoholic has his bottle.
The dope addict his needle.
I had my research.
I used to be a surgeon. It was my life.
Then one night in the laboratory, there... there was an accident.
They had to amputate my arm.
And...
He has used you, too...
I had no choice.
He was my only hope.
A surgeon needs both his arms, not just one.
Well, you see, my transplanted grotesqueness stayed, and so did I.
I live only for the day he can work a successful transplant to my body.
That is why I stay.
Transplant... my head onto another body?
Yes.
And he's insane with the belief he can do it.
But the tissues of my body would reject the tissues of another.
Reject it as the foreign substance it is.
The transplant would never take, it would never stay in place.
My blood's antibodies would attack it as they attack any invading matter.
Yes, but his new discovery, this new serum, may change all of that.
This serum, injected into the bloodstream, affects the lymphoid tissues.
Here in the neck, the lymphoids that provide the antibodies for the blood that detect foreign transplanted matter.
It was untested, untried.
Until we used it on you.
So that liquid in the blood that's being pumped through what's left of me... is what makes me feel the...
He may produce results he didn't ask for.
Results?
You mean, like this?
Results more terrible than your arm of relative beauty.
Results of power.
Of magnitude.
Power?
What power?
Can't you see that you're at the mercy of every element of the universe?
How can you speak of power?
I have a power.
This liquid that's he's pumped into me, my brain burns with it.
That thing inside and I are in touch.
Want me to prove it?
Oh, you can prove nothing.
You're powerless!
I'll show you how powerless I am.
You.
Behind that door.
Let me know if you hear me.
Whoever, whatever you are...
I command you.
You understand me?
I'm only a head and you're whatever you are.
Together we're strong!
More powerful than any of them.
What are you running from?
What's wrong with you?
Oh, it's you.
There's something wrong, something beyond control in that room.
There's nothing beyond my control.
She's alive and I'll keep her alive until I find her a body.
I can't talk anymore, I'm tired,
I've got to go to sleep.
Then you... you didn't find her a body?
Well, I've got to be careful.
I can't afford to be identified as the last person seen with a girl before she disappears.
Do you think you'll get one?
There are many things left for tomorrow.
Hi, I was about to call a cop the way you were looking me over.
How have you been, Bill?
Oh, just fine, Donna.
I haven't seen you for quite a while.
Too long, I'm still waiting for that call you once promised me.
Ah, you know how it is with interns.
All work.
All work and no play even makes for dull doctors.
You're gonna lose that bedside manner of yours.
Say, how about a little side course in anatomy?
- Yours, anytime!
- No, not mine.
A Body Beautiful contest, you know, bathing suit models, plenty of females on the hook.
Your eyes will have a field day, interested?
Oh, why not?
You're just what the doctor ordered.
Come on, jump in.
Ah, on second thought...
I just remembered I've got to stop by my place and take care of a few things.
It'll only take a minute.
You don't mind, do you?
I always follow the doctor's orders.
Anything you prescribe, I'll take.
That's what I like about you, Donna.
Always so obliging.
Hey, Donna, where are you going, what's the hurry?
Hey, Jeannie, we're going to look for some bodies.
- You mean the contest?
- Yeah.
- Got any room for me?
- Oh, sure, plenty.
Bill, this is Jeannie Reynolds.
Jeannie, this is Dr. Bill Cortner.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Hop in, first we gotta stop off at his place.
- Sure.
Well, as a matter of a fact, that can wait.
Now that there's two of you, it will have to wait.
Guess he thinks there's safety in numbers.
Oh, this time there is.
We promise not to hurt you.
And I promise not to hurt you.
- Oh, Bill, there's a seat.
- Oh, there looks fine.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Well, it looks like we're about ready to go.
Backstage are five of the girls who have reached the contest finals, and we are here to choose
Miss Body Beautiful.
Now we've eliminated everyone except the five finalists and they will be judged solely by your applause. So let's bring them on.
First... Helen Appleton.
Betty Brockton!
Terri Lund!
Peggy Howard!
She has the second nicest body
I've ever seen.
- What, second to you?
- No, another girl, a figure model.
You remember that one in school, years ago. The one who had the accident.
Oh, yeah, yeah, Doris, uh...
- Doris Powell.
- Yeah, is she still around?
Few people see her nowadays.
She just stays in her studio posing for art classes and camera bugs.
A figure model.
Poses for art classes.
The nicest body she's ever seen.
The nicest body.
Maybe this is the one. She's got to be!
I can keep Jan alive only for a few more hours.
I've got to find her a body.
He... he intends to kill somebody.
To rob them of their body.
Do you hear me?
Yes, you hear me.
You know how Bill's egotism drives him on and on.
To infamy upon infamy.
How can good ever be born of evil?
Yet he claims his work is for science.
For humanity.
To be joined to flesh not your own.
What's human in this?
Of how you must exist?
Locked behind that door.
We've got to stop him!
- Okay, boys, I've had it for today.
- Come on baby, one more.
- Just one more, please!
- Another five minutes, baby!
- Time's just about up anyway.
- Okay.
Say, Doris?
Would you like to have a drink with me?
Just you and me, away from everybody, some place where nobody will butt in, where you and I can really be alone.
No, thank you.
How about posing for me, private-like?
I'll pay you real money, real good money.
The kind of money they don't throw at you everyday and for doing hardly nothing at all.
I do my posing for classes only,
Wednesdays and Saturdays 8:00 to 10:00.
- Yeah, I know, but we can...
- Goodnight.
See it all, mister?
The show's over.
Next time bring a camera and buy a ticket.
I'm not running a charity!
You don't remember me, do you, Doris?
Every guy on the make gives me that same tired line.
I'm Bill Cortner.
Bill Cortner.
Long time ago, that fight.
- You almost tore that wise guy apart
- for making fun of me.
After my accident.
Look, uh, can't we go somewhere and talk?
No, I don't date men.
Because I pose like I do, your mind works overtime.
You get ideas.
You're all alike.
No, not all of us.
I'm not on the make for you.
Okay, so maybe you're better than most.
Maybe not. I still hate all men.
I hate them for what one did to me once.
Have you forgotten?
Well, have you?
No, I haven't forgotten.
Well, neither have I.
I carry the memory around with me.
Yeah, but you can't hide yourself away here forever.
Posting bare in front of a bunch of neurotics.
Listen, Galahad.
I trusted a man once, all the way!
What did it get me? He gets his head full of jealous lies and I get...
- You've got to forget what happened!
- How can I forget?
I carry the memory around with me.
Permanently!
Am I so appealing to you now?
Still so interested?
Doesn't it make you sick?
You don't even turn away from me, like everyone else does.
To me you're not ugly.
I see only beauty in you.
You have a lovely body and a face that can be made beautiful again also.
Yeah.
I've heard that song before.
I'm a doctor, I know. My father is one of the leading plastic surgeons, if anyone can help you, we can, I know I can.
I've been to doctors, it's no use.
The scar tissue's too deep.
No one can help me!
Ah, ah, that was a few years ago.
Today nothing is hopeless.
Yeah, we can graft scar and skin tissue that...
Why we can even freeze areas of the skin, and sand away damaged skin tissues.
The way you say that, that look in your eyes.
I almost wanna believe you.
I almost wanna believe you!
Well, then start believing, hmm?
Even if your father could help me, I couldn't pay him the kind of money it would take.
Oh, don't talk about money, he does a lot of work without any charge.
Why should you wanna do this for me?
What's in it for you?
I'm gonna make your face beautiful again, cut it off and give your body away.
I'm sorry.
Bill...
I have been knocked around so many times...
I've lost count!
It's tough living with this.
I don't mean to sound ungrateful.
Well, because you've been battered around, don't go sour.
You shouldn't lose your trust in people.
Not all of us.
I believe you, I want to.
Do you really think something can be done?
Only my father knows.
Look, we have a country place just out of town.
He's visiting for the weekend. I could take you there now for a consultation.
You mean tonight?
Well, if you'd rather wait till he comes back, if he comes back.
No, no, I mean, he wouldn't be annoyed, being bothered with me so late at night?
Well, you let me do the worrying, huh?
I'll do anything that'll help me get rid of this face.
Well, that's where I come in.
Remember the last time I helped you?
Where are you going?
Who are you calling?
My girlfriend,
I want to tell her the news.
Before you know what the verdict is gonna be?
You're right, I shouldn't talk until I know what's going to happen.
My girlfriend, she's supposed to drop in later,
- I'll have to leave her a note or something.
- Well, just tell her you'll see her later.
Otherwise she'll ask a lot of nosy questions.
We wanna be sure first.
- Just throw something on, huh?
- I'll be with you in a minute.
Just tell her you'll keep in touch.
I'll leave it on the table, she'll see it.
Had to go out with old friend Bill Cortner.
I'll call you tomorrow, Doris.
Here.
I'll leave it on the lamp.
She'll see it, won't she?
That's the first place she'll look.
I'll leave the lights on for her.
Hmm.
I have waited so long for this.
So have I.
Again!
Hit it again!
I've got to see your hideousness.
And you've got to see mine.
I wonder which of us is more awful.
Nothing you can be is more terrible than what I am.
A head without a body.
A head that should be in its grave.
I hate him.
I hate him for what he's done to me.
Can your horror match mine?
Quiet, someone's coming.
I have come to feed your friend.
While you feed yourself with hate, it prefers food.
Your former sniveling fear becomes you more.
Eh.
What makes you think
I'm afraid of what's in there?
Or of you?
A mere head in search of a body.
People fear what they don't understand.
And what they can't see.
Oh, what are you talking about?
You're nothing but a freak of life!
And a freak of death!
Why should I be afraid of a few knocks on a door?
But last night you ran.
You were afraid of what you imagined lay behind that door.
I?
Imagined?
It was I who helped graft together the bits and pieces that were stolen from the hospital.
An amputated arm, a leg, a torso.
It was I who helped piece 'em together like a monstrous jigsaw puzzle!
And that same medicine that he's fed to me to activate my lymphoid tissues.
Has he fed it to that?
No.
No, on that he used an earlier formula.
It wasn't as successful as the serum he's using on you.
But it was enough to allow the transplants to take.
If your experiment is successful... oh, then it'll be my turn.
And what else has happened to it?
What do you mean, what else?
Well, it's...
It's mutated some, of course.
It's changed considerably.
Why don't you open the door?
Then we'll both see how it's changed.
Listen, you. I warned you.
You better stop pestering me, do you hear?
I'm getting fed up with you and your insidious talk.
He should've cut out your tongue while he was at it!
Afraid?
Afraid of whom? Of you?
No. Not anymore.
But of it?
Nor of it.
He only keeps it locked in there so that... it will be safe, that's all.
Safe?
From me?
Oh, you beast.
I hope he prolongs your existence into a lifetime of agony.
Then we'll see who's laughing at whom!
You miserable fool!
Get him!
- Get him!
- Oh, my arm, oh!
Kill him!
You and your father live here?
Only on weekends when we wanna get away from the city.
This place certainly is lonely.
Well, the further from prying eyes the better.
I mean it's nice and quiet here, we can get away from the noise and telephones.
Oh, I guess it is.
Well, sit down, sit down,
I'll fix us a drink, huh?
My father should be back soon.
You mean he's not here now?
Oh, come on now, Doris.
Do I look like a maniac who goes around killing girls?
Now, you've got to learn to trust people.
Well, people like me, really.
Oh, I'm sorry. I trust you.
I trust you with my life.
Well, I can't ask for anymore than that.
I'll be right back.
Oh, I was beginning to think you'd forgotten about me.
Forgotten you? Oh, Doris, you've become very important to me.
Very important. I put a little water in it, so it wouldn't be too strong for you.
Fine, I'm not a very heavy drinker.
Neither am I.
Well, um, here's to your future.
Whatever it may be.
I'll drink to that.
Oh, it's getting awfully warm in here.
I feel kind of funny.
Bill?
You put something in my drink!
Didn't you?
I told you I'd bring you a body.
A beautiful one.
Soon it will be yours.
Bill, you can't!
Yes, I can!
I want you as a complete woman, not part of one.
Is it a crime to wanna keep you alive?
Is it a crime for science to jump ahead by years?
This kind of thing must be done.
When it's over, you'll see.
I've got to hurry now.
The drug will wear off soon and she'll be awake.
When she does come to, it will be your head consciously awakening for her.
You must be stopped!
You must!
And who's going to do it?
Now it's got to be quiet here.
You can't stop me.
Very well.
I told you to let me die.
Energy takes on many forms.
Example. What do we know of acoustical energy?
It was discovered by a famous scientist, right? Wrong.
We must give credit to an Italian who one night was singing an aria in a Milano pizza parlor.
You know the story.
How he hit a high note and the sound waves shattered a glass on the other side of the room?
Watch me, and I will show you acoustical energy at work.
Now, your next assignment will be...
Oh, I forgot.
There'll be no assignment.
See you next week.
Here we are.
The beginning of the end.
Point of no return.
The last mile.
Now, Shelby.
All right.
"Of all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these.
"It might have been."
Shelby, you promised.
Now stop.
Did I promise to stop loving you?
Open the door and let me out.
Suppose he doesn't show up this time.
Oh, Reverend, how nice to see you.
You must be getting tired of my wedding.
Third time's the charm, they say.
But I am glad that this time you brought the bridegroom with you.
At last we meet,
Professor Brainard.
No, this is Professor Ashton.
He's Romance Languages.
Professor Brainard is Physical Chemistry.
Oh, dear me, I seem to have made a mistake.
Not you, sir.
It's Miss Carlisle's mistake.
I've just been trying to talk her out of this blunder.
Shelby, you are speaking of the man I love.
Love, darling, is a bouquet of fragrant hyacinths.
Not a beaker of hydrogen.
Am I right, sir?
I merely perform the service.
I don't take sides.
Betsy!
Well, well, here comes the bride.
- Reverend.
- Good evening, sir.
Professor Ashton from Rutland University.
Aren't you on the wrong campus?
Miss Carlisle invited me.
Yes, yes, I remember.
There was talk that you were a contender for Betsy's hand.
Rutland can't win them all.
Oh, it was so sweet of you to go to all this trouble.
And for the third time, too.
Well, you know, third time's the charm.
That's exactly what I just said.
I'm sick of having a spinster for a secretary.
I better change.
The guests will be coming soon.
The bridegroom, too, I hope.
I've alerted his housekeeper.
She'll see that he gets here.
# The ring is in
your right-side pocket #
Professor!
Professor Brainard!
# Square root of "E" minus "C,"
alpha "G" #
No.
No, don't stop.
Don't stop.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Please don't stop.
Oh, not again.
Professor?
# Bum bum-bum-bum #
Time for you to get dressed.
Just five more minutes,
Mrs. Chatsworth.
Professor, well, heavens, what are you doing?
I'm trying to solve the secrets of the universe.
And failing.
Failing miserably.
You're stopping.
Do you know what time it is?
You've been working all afternoon.
Mrs. Chatsworth, I've been working for three months.
Pardon me.
I've been working on something very important.
More important, I suppose, than getting married?
Oh! Mrs. Chatsworth, I don't know what I'd do without you.
Oh, you're getting a wonderful girl.
If you ask me, she's too good for you.
Thanks, Mrs. Chatsworth.
I love you, too.
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll be in in the morning to feed the dog.
- What's the matter with me?
- Is anything wrong?
What a lunkhead. Instead of minus, it should be plus.
So, the molecular configuration of "A"...
...is almost the same as that of "B."
Therefore, if I don't worry about "A" throwing off free hydrogen, it could stand a few degrees more centigrade.
Remember, I promised that sweet girl I'd have you there on time.
Yes, Mrs. Chatsworth.
And, Professor, may I say happy honeymoon?
You certainly may,
Mrs. Chatsworth.
And the same to you.
Miscalculation has been staring me in the face for weeks.
Can't see the forest for the trees.
Right, Charlie?
All right, Charlie.
Cross your fingers.
Now. Good.
Good.
Very good.
182. That's good.
Yes.
Yes.
Now we're cooking, Charlie!
We may be in business yet!
It's just awful.
Poor darling.
What ails the man?
Missing his own wedding three times.
He might still show up.
You know the old saying.
Third time's the charm.
I say three strikes and you're out!
Thank you all for coming.
I'll return your presents.
I hope you can get your money back.
I'm sorry.
After all the trouble you've gone to.
I'll be at the office at the usual time in the morning.
I want to go on as if nothing has happened.
Shelby, I don't seem to have an escort.
Would you mind waiting?
I'm yours to command.
Oh, Betsy.
Oh, hello, Charlie.
Go back to bed now.
Let's go back to sleep, hmm?
What happened?
What happened?
Well, that's the end of that.
Get away, Charlie.
Get away, Charlie.
I'm not sure what we've got here, Charlie, but if we've got what I think we've got, we've got something.
There's one way to find out.
Ready?
Yes!
Yes, Charlie!
We've got it!
Do you see?
It's not going lower and lower.
It's going higher and higher.
You know what that means?
It means just one thing.
It's generating its own energy.
You know what that means,
Charlie?
It means we've discovered a new kind of energy!
A new kind of energy, Charlie.
It's a breakthrough!
A breakthrough, Charlie!
Discovered. Substance "X."
In appearance, subscribes to classical requirements of metastable compound, but whose behavior is distinctly nonclassical.
Hypothesis. The application of an external force triggers a molecular change, liberating energy of a type previously unknown.
I suppose you think these are just rubber balls.
Or maybe a flying rubber ball.
But you know what this really is?
Of course you don't.
We just discovered it.
We've got to give it a name.
Let's see.
Flying rubber.
Flying rubber.
Flubber?
All right.
Substance "X."
We dub thee "Flubber."
If Flubber's going to be of any use, we've got to control it, right?
So, you take an ordinary radioactive isotope.
Now a sliding shutter to let the right amount of gamma rays through to bombard the Flubber.
Now, we put it under here so that we can bombard the Flubber with gamma rays to trigger the molecular change.
Which is more scientific than kicking it or bouncing it around the room.
All right.
Here we go.
Eureka!
It works.
Perfect control.
Now we ease off on the gamma rays.
And back to Earth.
Light as a daisy.
Just as I thought.
Just as I thought, Charlie.
Weight makes absolutely no difference.
Just shoot up a few extra gamma rays.
Isn't that wonderful,
Charlie?
Professor!
Are you still here?
What about the wedding?
I can still make it.
It's 5 minutes to 8:00.
Yes, 5 minutes to 8:00.
In the morning.
In the morning?
No.
No, I didn't do it again.
I got to go and see Betsy and tell her what happened.
I know what you're thinking.
But don't you worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.
When I tell Betsy what I've done, she's gonna be happy.
Oh. Mrs. Chatsworth.
Don't you tell a soul, but I've discovered Flubber.
That poor, poor girl.
Are you sure it was wise to come in today?
I'm perfectly all right.
Mr. Alonzo Hawk, president of the Auld Lang Syne loan company, et cetera, et cetera.
My dear Mr. Hawk...
During the past few days,
I have been disturbed by rumors that you plan to take our campus and construct a housing tract thereon.
Oh, surely he wouldn't.
Not even Mr. Hawk.
Let's hope not, my dear.
The situation requires delicate handling.
But he's an alumnus.
My dear girl, our esteemed alumnus made an extremely large loan to the college.
That loan is overdue, and Mr. Hawk has us, if you'll forgive a pertinent expression, over a barrel.
However, my dear Mr. Hawk,
I am quite confident that I can demonstrate how an extension of your loan would be in the best interest to all of us.
I'd like to suggest a meeting at the earliest opportunity that would be convenient to you.
I shall make myself available.
Psst!
However, Mr. Hawk...
Don't be angry. I'm sorry
I missed the wedding again.
Look, I couldn't help it.
Of your loan is in all our best interests.
Go.
Get out of here.
Don't want to see you.
I was working in the laboratory and had an explosion.
Go.
Get out of here.
I do not want to see you.
I hit my head.
I fell on the floor.
I was knocked out.
Knocked out.
I know your heart is with us.
Go. Get out.
Look, the most wonderful thing happened.
Wait till you hear.
Look.
Flubber.
I shall make myself available at any time.
Flubber. Flubber.
...of the greatest importance.
No, make that "of the most supreme importance."
Flubber.
Flubber. Flubber.
Flubber. Flubber.
Flubber. Watch.
Oh. Good morning, sir.
I'd like to speak to
Miss Carlisle, if I may.
Betsy, I... Oh, sir,
I just wanted to tell her that I'm sorry
I missed the wedding.
I have the most wonderful thing to tell you.
The most wonderful thing you can tell me is "goodbye."
In which I heartily concur.
This way.
Just a minute.
If you'd give me a chance, she'd forgive me.
Anything you say would be superfluous.
Kindly take your ball and go.
Daggett!
Why, Mr. Hawk.
What a pleasant surprise.
I want a word with you.
I, too, have been wanting to chat about our loan.
- That'll be all, Brainard.
- Brainard!
Is this the one you call "Neddy the Nut"?
Yeah, that's right, Pop.
Do you know that this man flunked my boy?
No, Mr. Hawk.
I welcome this opportunity.
If the teacher and the parent of the backward student...
Backward?
May I remind you it was Hawk brains that founded this town?
Hawk brains that built it?
And you have the gall to say that my boy, who proudly bears the name of Hawk, is backward?
I'd just as soon forget...
Will you shut up when I talk?
I wish I could show you his examination paper.
Not only did he miss every answer, he misspelled the name of the college.
Do you mind?
I'd like to discuss the matter alone with Mr. Hawk.
This means my boy can't play in the big game tonight against Rutland.
Where's your school spirit?
Flunking your star player.
I don't think this is a place to lend a half a million dollars.
We have principles here at Medfield.
I offered to help Biff.
A makeup exam.
But he couldn't be bothered.
So he's ineligible.
None of your vague promises about lending money is going to change that.
Mr. Hawk has already loaned the money. The school is grateful.
Professor, I rejoice in your sense of ethics.
But do you mind terribly if I speak for myself?
- Mr. Hawk.
- Hold it.
I came to have my say, and I've said it.
Mr. Hawk, a moment of your time.
I'd like to discuss our loan.
You'd like to discuss our loan?
Well, I have an office downtown for that!
And you might bring some of those principles of yours and see how much they're worth in cold cash!
Come on, Biffer.
Get me the file on wealthy alumni marked "emergency."
- We have some letters to write.
- Yes, sir.
You've got to let me explain.
Then you'll understand why I missed the wedding.
All right, go ahead.
I'd like that.
For once I would really like to understand.
Like most things that seem complicated, it was actually quite simple.
I was thinking in terms of magnetic energy, when what I was after was repulsive energy.
Silly. But you know how you get carried away.
Yes. I know.
If not for this explosion,
I might never have found it.
The application of thermal energy to two incompatible metastable compounds brought about fusion, the release of explosive gases, and a residue.
Do you know what that residue was?
No.
Flubber.
Flubber!
Well, it's been thrilling.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Betsy, never in my wildest dreams did I hope to find a compound whose configuration is such that the delivery of energy to its surface would trigger a change in the configuration.
This change liberates enormous quantities of energy.
But they act in a direction opposite that of the force which triggered the change.
We call it repulsive energy.
That's just the way I feel.
Yet strangely enough, the total effect is transient.
Upon the shutting off of the energy, the elemental particles return to pseudo-equilibrium.
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Yes!
Now that I clearly understand what happened to my wedding, will you excuse me?
President Daggett and I have some important work.
Such as, I hope, saving the college.
But, Betsy, don't you see?
This can save the college.
It could be worth millions.
Do me a personal favor.
Go bounce your ball somewhere else.
We'll talk it out tonight.
I'll pick you up for the game.
Well, I guess we shook them up a little.
Nobody's gonna push us around.
You're kidding, aren't you?
About closing the college and turning the grounds into a housing tract?
I'm gonna teach you some facts of life.
Small college. Like the small country store, little drugstore.
They're all in the same boat.
They're sinking.
Today is the day of the supermarkets, the supercolleges.
The little man is gonna get squashed.
But you graduated from Medfield.
It's your college.
So what do you want?
Some total stranger to close it down?
Or some loyal, friendly alumnus to take care of things?
Isn't there something you could do?
Give them some more time on the loan or something.
I'm sentimental about
Medfield just like you.
But it's like shooting a horse that has a broken leg.
I want to do it to put it out of its misery.
Now, if I happen to make a few extra bucks, well, that's just something you're going to have to learn to accept.
Yes, sir.
Oh, about the game.
Has word gotten around that you're not playing?
Not that I know of.
Not yet.
Say, Lenny, see what the point spread is on the Medfield-Rutland game tonight.
How much you want to go for?
Whatever the traffic will bear.
8,000 or 10,000 bucks.
You're not betting on Medfield.
Without me on the team, we'll get murdered.
Who said I'm betting on Medfield?
You're not betting against us?
Son, we have access to some very valuable information about that game tonight.
There's a saying.
"It's an ill wind that doesn't blow a few bucks into the coffers of the
Auld Lang Syne loan company."
Get the point?
When we pull down the spark lever, this shutter opens and releases the gamma rays.
Up goes the Flubber and the car.
We pull the gas lever, this shutter opens, and the car goes.
We press on the brake, this opens, and the rays bring the car to a stop.
If we open the shutter farther, the car goes in reverse.
Charlie, suppose we get a little tired of just going straight ahead.
So we turn the wheel to the right, and we bank to the right.
Turn the wheel to the left, and we bank to the left.
Well, that's about it,
Charlie.
The important thing is nobody finds out.
Except Betsy, of course.
So people don't ask questions, we'll put this under the hood so it'll sound like a Model T.
That ought to do it, Charlie.
Now all they'll say is,
"Professor, see you finally got that old collector's item in running order."
All right, Charlie.
We're all set.
All clear, Charlie.
Now we'll get your safety belt.
Now this side.
Good dog.
Now... sound on.
Lights on.
And gas lever down.
Hang onto your hat, Charlie.
It handles beautifully, Charlie.
We don't need these up here, do we?
There. That's better.
Now watch this, Charlie.
Not bad, Charlie.
Let's open her up and see what she'll really do.
Yoo-hoo!
Well, look what we got down there.
Look out, girls.
Here we come.
Look out, Charlie!
Gonna have to watch where I'm going, huh?
Yeah.
Charlie, I've got an idea.
Why don't we fly over and drop in on that certain someone?
# Do-do do-do #
# Do-do-do do-do #
# That lovely, adorable
Betsy of mine #
# Oh, won't she be happy,
sweet Betsy of mine #
# When we take her flying,
that Betsy of mine #
# She'll hug me and tell me
she's not really sore #
# That lovely, adorable
Betsy of mine #
Can you imagine what she'll say when she sees this?
- Was there something you wanted?
- Yes.
I'd like to speak to
Miss Carlisle if you don't mind.
I'm afraid I do, old man.
Miss Carlisle and I are leaving for the game.
- Ready, dear?
- Yes, Shelby.
- Before you go...
- Excuse us.
Betsy, please come here.
If you don't mind.
I have the most wonderful thing.
Ned, I am trying not to be angry.
Please, don't make a scene.
Haven't you caused Miss Carlisle enough embarrassment?
Betsy, it's a surprise.
It's a sort of wedding present.
Just what every girl dreams about.
It's not the car, Betsy.
It's what's inside the car.
I can't show it with him around.
Now, would you excuse us?
Betsy!
Betsy, you know what
I was telling you about this morning in the office about my discovery?
I want to show you what I've done with it.
I want you to take one ride around the block.
Just one little ride, Betsy.
How'd it go?
All the loot's down.
But I had to give them 6 to 1.
Get back on the phone.
See if you can find any more of that kind of money.
I'm afraid it isn't
Medfield's night.
My dear, victory isn't everything.
"To love the game beyond the prize, to honor while you strike him down, the foe that comes with fearless eyes."
Excuse me.
- Oh. Professor.
Pardon me, please.
Late as usual, I see.
Come on, Medfield!
Hate to see you betting against our team.
This isn't betting.
This is like making it in the cellar.
Oh, if Biff Hawk were only playing tonight.
Yes, yes.
I heard he was ineligible.
Now, I wonder who could've flunked your star player.
We're much more realistic about things like that at Rutland.
I understand you pay your players more than you do your teachers.
That's ridiculous.
I get twice as much as...
I really don't care to discuss it.
Our poor boys.
They try so hard!
I feel sorry for people who don't know when they're beaten.
Don't you, Professor?
Now, Shelby, please don't start anything!
Why doesn't he go down and sit in the Rutland section?
I'm sorry.
It's not fair!
Our team can't even reach the ball!
Yes, poor little chaps.
I'd say they need some kind of a lift.
Why don't they try elevator heels?
Very funny.
Elevator heels.
Pardon me.
Would you pardon me, please?
There's more than one way to skin a cat.
She won't ride in my car with me? Okay.
She won't listen to me.
Okay.
So we're gonna surprise her, Charlie.
More than that, we're gonna Flubberghast her.
Boys, what can I say?
I'm proud of you.
They're murdering us.
But I'm proud of you.
Remember, you're like sons to me.
All of you.
How do you think I feel?
Do you think it's easy sitting, watching you guys getting your ears pinned back?
Well, let me tell you this.
I've coached a lot of teams in my day, but I've never seen harder-fighting boys than you boys right here.
You got heart.
I mean, real heart.
Coach, do we really have to go back out there?
Look, I know how you feel, son.
But remember this.
A team that won't be beaten...
Well, Professor!
Oh, hello, Coach.
Something the matter?
Maybe something on your conscience?
No. I just dropped by to see if there's anything I can do.
I am sorry I had to flunk
Biff. If that's what you mean.
It's a little late for apologies, don't you think?
One minute, Coach.
All right.
Get ready.
Starting lineup same as the first half.
Too bad Biff didn't keep his grades up.
That's one of those things.
Just remember, one man doesn't make a team.
And I tell you, you can go out and beat Rutland.
You can win this game.
Sure we can.
Yes, you can.
Because I know something about you that you don't know.
They're twice as big, but that doesn't make any difference now.
They could be 10 feet tall.
We could still beat them.
Yes. We could.
You can beat Rutland if you give it all the drive and the bounce you've got.
Remember that word "bounce."
Bounce.
And when you bounce, remember this.
No matter how much you put in, you're going to get twice as much out of it.
Now, get out there, fellows, and hop to it!
Say, what's going on out there?
- What got into 'em?
- I don't know!
Maybe it was that pep talk
Brainard gave them!
- What did he say?
- I wish I could remember!
Go, Medford! Go!
Will you listen to me?
There's something fishy going on!
All right. What?
You tell me!
Well, how do I know?
Something!
What am I supposed to do?
There's nothing that says one team can't jump higher than the other!
Time's up! Let's go!
Gosh, Pop. Look at them go!
Look-it!
I'm looking!
Come on, Medfield!
Come on, team!
Come on, Medfield!
Come on, team!
Look at them go!
Aren't they terrific?
Sorry, Pop.
I forgot.
Come on, team!
Hey, what do you know?
Lenny just laid off
5 G's against Medfield.
Against Medfield?
Oh, thank you so much!
You meathead!
Don't you know what's going on out there?
Shoot, Harper! Shoot!
Go! Go!
We did it!
Sure, we did it!
I did it because you wouldn't listen.
What do you mean you did it?
You saw the way the boys played.
The reason they could play like that is my discovery.
Surely you're not taking credit for Medfield winning?
In a way, yes.
Now I've heard everything.
To watch those boys out there fighting, playing their hearts out, and to hear you taking the bows for it.
I didn't mean it...
Pretty small, Brainard.
That's all I can say.
Pretty small.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Now, Betsy.
Betsy, wait a minute.
Shelby, please give me time to think.
Of course, darling.
You can give me your answer tomorrow night after the dance.
I think I know what it will be.
Good night, my love.
Good night, Shelby.
You probably thought of me as a kindly, level-headed professor.
Well, now you see what a woman can do to you.
I'm a desperate man.
Desperate men do desperate things.
Lights off.
Sound off.
And up we go.
Officer! Officer!
Officer, help me!
It's after me! Help me!
I do hope that you will excuse my appearance.
But I was just having a cup of boiling-hot coffee.
- But it's after me!
- What's after you?
I don't know.
Some kind of a thing!
A thing?
Can you describe it?
No, I didn't see it.
But it flies.
And it made a noise.
Like aaoooga! Aaooga!
Then it banged down on the top of my car.
Voom! Voom!
And when I looked, there wasn't anything!
Ohhhh.
That kind of a thing.
Suppose you blow into this thing.
We'll see if we can find where it came from.
Do something!
It's probably lurking in the dark, ready to spring!
Go on!
Don't worry.
We won't let it get you.
Now, come on, blow, okay?
This is outrageous!
I happen to be Professor Ashton, head of the English department at Rutland!
And a very important person there!
In that case, this ought to be easy for an English teacher.
Can you say "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers"?
Have you gone mad?
Or perhaps you'd prefer
"Round the rugged rock the ragged rascal ran."
I'll say no such idiotic thing!
We are not being very cooperative, now, are we?
Come on. Blow into this.
We'd appreciate it.
I'll do no such thing!
Blow.
Blow!
Having trouble, Officer Hanson?
No, just the usual.
We always have 502s after the Rutland game.
Uh-huh. I didn't know they were such bad losers.
Brainard, tell these idiots...
Professor, I see you finally got the Model T in working order.
Yeah. It took a little fixing.
But here she is.
Hey...
Sounds like it could use a little valve job in there.
You know how it is with Model T's.
Sometimes you swear they could run without valves.
Or even without a motor!
- Well, so long, Officer.
- So long, Professor.
Brainard!
Tell them who I am!
Now, you told us who you are.
Suppose we all go confide in the sergeant, hmm?
You boys are a big comfort.
I take a bath for $ 15,000, and you can't find what happened!
Maybe they slipped them some new vitamin pill.
If we can grab one of the boys, we could give him a test.
Forget it, will you?
Hi, Pop.
Did you find out anything?
- I sure did.
- What?
It was Neddy the Nut.
The professor?
Well, what did he do?
- He was in the locker room.
- And then?
Gave the boys a pep talk.
Well, what else?
He just talked to them.
Talked to them?
Is that the...
Will you give me that?
Is that the big news you had for me?
Well, is it?
That's about the size of it.
Oh, three cheers for you, sonny.
That's an Earth-shattering bit of information you got there.
Biff! Come here!
Come here!
You see anything?
Just Neddy the Nut flying his old Model T.
Say that again.
Neddy the Nut flying his old Model T!
Yeah!
And that's the genius you were calling a nut!
Oh, yeah. In class, he's been beating our ears about some new kind of energy.
Says he's looking for a breakthrough.
Breakthrough?
Have you any idea what that kind of jazz is worth?
Gentlemen to see you,
Professor.
I can't see anybody now.
What does he want?
Your kind indulgence,
Professor.
Can you find it to forgive this hot-blooded businessman?
Hot-blooded businessman who plans to tear down Medfield?
What do you want?
Wonderful things.
Wonderful things for all of us.
Visualize, if you will, a whole new Medfield College.
10 new buildings
10 stories high.
One building devoted entirely to science.
Two, if you will?
Three?
How does that sound?
It sounds great.
But just where is all this money coming from, Mr. Hawk?
From a certain revolutionary discovery.
What's revolutionary about a Tin Lizzie?
Nothing.
Unless, of course, it happens to fly.
Fly?
Like I happened to see it do last night.
You saw it, huh?
Uh-huh.
Prof, I gotta hand it to you.
Hold it!
Why don't we trust each other?
You're a man of science.
Head in the clouds.
I'm a down-to-Earth, dollar-and-cents man.
My pop always says he can smell a buck...
I'll do the talking, son!
That's a good boy.
There's a million angles.
The government.
The space age!
What they wouldn't give to get their hands on this little Tin Lizzie.
That's where I come in.
When I get through talking with them, they'll come crawling with bags of money.
Barrels of money!
Mr. Hawk, let me get this straight.
You want me to turn my discovery over so you can blackmail our government?
All right, look at it this way.
Medfield College can grow and prosper.
Or it can wither and die on the vine.
That's entirely up to you.
I see. Mr. Hawk, I want to thank you for dropping by.
You've made up my mind.
Now you're talking!
I'm calling the President.
Daggett?
He don't cut any ice.
The President of the United States.
Is that enough ice for you?
Oh, let's not go flying off in all directions.
Just one direction. Out.
Oh, don't get me wrong.
I heartily endorse our government.
All right. You're lowering the boom on Medfield.
But don't you try to come back afterwards.
The iron door is shut!
Well, there goes the ball game.
He'll telephone Washington.
By tomorrow, this place will be swarming with sharpies.
Supposing you did get the professor's discovery.
Did you mean not closing Medfield?
They get that flying jalopy, there's millions down the drain!
If you did, I've got an idea.
- Quiet. I'm trying to think.
- Switch cars.
That idiot Brainard.
If he could've...
What did you say, son?
Switch cars on him.
There are other
Model T's around.
Yeah, there are, aren't there, Biffer?
Fellow in Appleton who's got the same model.
Hold it.
I'm way ahead of you.
Lenny, take the Appleton turnoff.
Hey, you know something?
You're all right, son.
Course, you got a little of your mother in you.
Actually, well, you're just me all over again!
Yes, sir!
You're all right!
I can assure you the President is interested in any development which might have to do with our national welfare.
May I inquire as to the nature of your discovery?
Flubber?
Yes, that does sound significant.
Now, if I only knew which branch of the government might best be served by your discovery?
Any branch.
You name it.
Transportation. Industry.
Agriculture.
Agriculture?
Good.
Oh, don't cut me off.
Agriculture Department.
Sam Wheeler speaking.
Splendid.
Mmm. I see.
How do you figure this can help the farmer?
I don't want to help the farmer.
I want to help everybody!
Don't you understand?
What possibilities do you think this might have as a fertilizer?
Fertilizer?
Don't you people understand how vital this thing is?
It's not only agriculture.
It's industry.
It's national defense.
Oh, national defense.
National defense.
Before we go further,
I just want you to know that I am proud of the new spirit of cooperation between the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force.
Even the newspapers are talking about it.
There never was any difference between us.
Just newspaper guff in the first place.
There's a Professor Brainard on the phone from Medfield.
I don't know any
Professor Brainard.
Tell him to write me.
He might have some connection with Congressman Brainard.
Brainard swings a lot of lead.
He's always been very friendly to us.
Very well.
Hello?
Well, how are you,
Professor?
What can we do for you?
Oh, you have, eh?
Why, that's amazing.
Sort of antigravity.
Well, well.
And you think it's a breakthrough?
Looks like you don't need all that appropriation money.
Got a fellow said he cracked the antigravity problem in his own garage.
Ridiculous.
Another crackpot.
Army's been doing antigravity research for years.
Hasn't come up with anything significant.
Oh, yes.
Yes, Professor.
I'm listening.
Yes, Professor.
Yes, yes.
I realize it's urgent.
So many things are these days.
Oh? You want to come down here to Washington?
Well, now, I don't know about that.
We'd love to see you, of course.
Alert my pilot to standby.
Yes, but we're all busy as bird dogs around here.
I tell you what, Professor.
Why don't you write us a nice, short letter?
Tell us all about it.
Right. And keep up the good work, Professor.
Call us any time.
Oh, better still, we'll call you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
They won't listen.
Betsy won't listen.
Hawk is the only one that will believe me.
Professor?
Come in, Mrs. Chatsworth.
There you are. Sponged and pressed for the dance tonight.
Thank you. But I won't be going to the dance.
Oh, no. You're not letting that sweet girl go with someone else?
That sweet girl has kicked me out of her life.
What are you gonna do?
Stay home, talk to the dog?
Mrs. Chatsworth, don't turn against me.
Professor, may I say something?
I'd rather you wouldn't.
Not just now.
All right.
Do as you please.
Go with your head in the clouds and your nose poked places it doesn't belong.
Go ahead, like I said.
Unlock the secrets of the universe.
But remember this.
The universe is millions and millions of years old.
It can wait a little.
But girls can't wait.
Mrs. Chatsworth,
I'm not going...
One day, a girl simply says to herself, "That's enough.
I'll just marry the next man that comes along."
And she does.
- Mrs. Chatsworth...
- lf I were in your shoes,
I'd stop that smashing or mashing the atom or whatever it is you're doing, and I'd go to that dance.
Why? Betsy won't even look at me.
Don't they have those numbers where you tap the dancers on the shoulders?
Yes, I suppose.
Well, then, you walk up to that Shelby, tap him on the shoulder, then when he turns.
I'll punch him.
Good.
No, that wouldn't be civilized.
Well, for goodness sake, grab the girl in your arms, hold her tight, and dance her off into the night.
Show him up.
Show up Shelby Ashton?
"The Ballroom Beast"?
He's the best dancer around here.
I dance like a sleepwalking chimpanzee.
But even a chimpanzee will fight for its mate.
I told you he'd turn up here tonight.
# And sink the Army,
sink the Army gray #
Taxi!
You boys get right in.
I'm the only taxi.
I'm pulling right out.
Where to?
Professor Brainard's house.
What are you doing?
Even a chimpanzee fights for his mate.
Aah!
Let me go.
People are looking!
Good.
Let's not disappoint them.
Must have given himself a pep talk.
Maybe you can learn something.
Go, Prof! Go!
We ought to do this more often.
Oh, Ned!
# He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease #
# The daring young man
on the flying trapeze #
I wonder what's going on.
Let's go see.
We've had enough fun for one night.
On second thought, maybe the fun's just beginning!
I beg your pardon.
- Are you from Washington?
- We are.
Are you looking for Professor...
Brainard?
Oh, I'm afraid that's not me.
There's your man.
This is a surprise, your coming all the way from Washington.
Here we are.
Get right in, gentlemen.
Get right in the car, please.
Admiral? General?
Now, I realize that military technology has progressed far beyond the Model T.
- Of course.
- I want you to understand.
I'm using it as a security measure.
What better place to hide my discovery than in a Model T?
I want you to keep in mind that this is only a primitive application of my discovery.
We use this spark lever here to levitate, the gas lever to move forward, and the brake to stop or to go in reverse.
Absolute control at all times, as you will see.
All right, get a good, tight grip on your emotions and prepare for takeoff.
Cool head.
A steady hand.
And up we go!
Well, if at first you don't succeed.
Then what?
Try again.
Well, surely you gentlemen understand this sort of thing.
The first time you tried to launch a rocket, it didn't...
...go up.
It's probably just a short in the control mechanism.
I'm sorry about this delay.
We'll have this in the air in a minute.
This is some kind of a joke.
- I want to see what's in there.
- Just a minute.
Somebody's just playing a practical joke!
I'm not laughing.
Just a minute, gentlemen!
Look, gentlemen, wait.
Please.
Nice going.
That was rich about the squirrel.
A real Hawk touch.
Kind of a mean trick to play.
We're doing him a favor.
You'll see.
Well, I think we've cleared the air on one point.
What's that?
With what's happened,
I'm sure there's no doubt about you and Ned Brainard.
No.
None whatsoever.
As the Bard says,
"That he is mad, 'tis true;
'tis true 'tis pity; and pity 'tis 'tis true."
Oh, shut up!
If that's what she thinks of Shakespeare...
Ned?
If you've come out to gloat,
I can do without that.
I'm not gloating.
I know what you're thinking.
That I'm a fraud. That I'm really losing my marbles.
Are you sure you're all right?
I solemnly swear to you,
I have flown this car.
Oh, don't, darling.
I'll take you home.
- You get a good night's rest.
- Betsy...
Wait a minute.
Why didn't I think to show this to them?
I got so upset when the car wouldn't fly. Here.
Take this.
Now hold it out.
Now drop it.
Flubber!
That's how I was able to bounce around.
That's how we won the game.
This is what makes the car fly.
Are you sure you actually made that car fly?
This very car.
No.
No. I take that back.
Well, did you or didn't you?
This isn't my car, Betsy.
My car had a radio in it.
Somebody switched cars on me.
- Hawk.
- Hawk?
Alonzo Hawk.
He saw me flying the car.
He came to make a deal.
I turned him down.
He stole my car.
Are you sure?
Will you stop saying that?
I'm sure.
Please believe me.
We've got to get that car.
In the hands of Hawk...
I believe you.
If we could figure out some way to...
You what?
I believe you.
You do?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, Betsy.
I'm glad to see you came around to my way of thinking.
I'm with you 100%, Mr. Hawk.
I know. But we were discussing the Model T.
What's with these shoes?
Flubber, Mr. Hawk.
When you wear these shoes, you'll have a spring in your step.
You live life to the fullest.
When the time comes to shuffle off this mortal coil, you won't shuffle.
You'll go out with a hop, a skip, and a song in your heart.
I still don't get it.
What about the Model T?
Well, Mr. Hawk, surely you can see the point.
Why, shoes are 10 times more valuable than a flying car.
- How come?
- Well, figure it out.
Only 8% of the world's population buy cars.
Practically everybody buys shoes.
She's right.
Sure, she's right.
Now, take it easy, Mr. Hawk.
I'll show you how the Flubber works.
Just tap your heel on the floor.
You see?
- Yeah.
- All right.
I don't know if
I can hold my balance.
It just takes a little getting used to.
Why, Ned's crazy about his.
Aren't you, dear?
Yes, I certainly am.
I can't tell you the lift I've gotten.
Now, just jump up and down, Mr. Hawk.
- Up and down?
- Uh-huh.
There we go!
There we go!
Mr. Hawk, I think that's high enough for right now.
Oh, Betsy.
Hold him down!
That's fantastic!
Hold him down, Betsy.
There we are.
Wasn't that wonderful?
- Wonderful. Why did you stop?
- To talk.
We know you're interested in more than money.
- Surely you are.
- I am? What?
Humanity, Mr. Hawk.
You can save lives with these shoes.
Of course you can.
Now, suppose.
Just suppose.
There's a fire.
A raging fire.
The stairs are an inferno.
The smoke is billowing.
We're trapped!
Help! Help! Help!
The flames are creeping closer and closer.
Oh, no, no, no!
I can't stand it any longer!
Geronimo!
My boy!
Nothing to it, Mr. Hawk.
Why, that's amazing!
Your turn, Mr. Hawk.
Oh, now, just a minute.
Oh, it's fun, Mr. Hawk.
Go ahead!
You'll land light as a thistle.
I promise you.
Well, I don't know.
Let me put it this way.
I wouldn't want a partner who doesn't have faith in his product.
You better do it.
He's very fussy about things like that.
Nobody's been able to call me a coward.
I should say not, Mr. Hawk.
Come on down, Mr. Hawk!
One, two...
- I changed my mind.
- Three!
Help!
Whee!
Hey, look!
Look!
I'm doing it!
Sure you are, Mr. Hawk.
Put a little more spring into it.
See how simple it is?
Flex your knees.
That's right.
Look at Mr. Hawk, dear.
Isn't he doing well?
This is marvelous!
Brainard, we've got something here.
Sure we have, Mr. Hawk.
Okay, I'm sold!
Now, how do I stop?
What did he say?
- I can't quite catch it.
- I can't either!
I said, tell me how to stop!
You can tell me something.
What have you done with my car?
You tricked me!
That's right, Mr. Hawk.
Now, where is it?
Where did you hide it?
In my warehouse!
- In his warehouse!
- Thanks, Mr. Hawk!
Hey, how do I stop?
Happy landing, Mr. Hawk!
Wait! Don't go!
Professor Brainard!
Come back!
Don't leave me! Wait!
Don't go! Biff!
Biff, where are you?
It's your father calling!
Huh?
Biff! Son!
Wake up! Get out of bed!
Help your father!
Hey, that's pretty neat, Pop.
How do you do that?
Well, don't just lie there, you nitwit!
Get some somebody!
Get the fire department!
Don't blow a gasket.
Stop me!
Help!
I don't get it.
Why we got to sit around watching that crummy car?
'Cause Hawk says so, that's why.
You figure he knows what he's doing?
Fisheye didn't pile up that loot by being stupid, you know what I mean?
Here I go.
Up we go.
No. I got to go up higher.
No.
There we are.
Looks like people got behind in their payments.
Dear sweet Mr. Hawk.
Shh.
Lenny?
Yeah, what?
Do you hear noises?
Like what kind of noises?
Sort of like a...
...a harp.
Now, let's see.
No, no, no, no!
Betsy, put it down.
Down.
Down?
Easy. Easy.
There.
No, no.
No.
You'd better take my shoe off.
I can't get the knot undone.
Oh! My nail!
Shh.
Maybe I can help you.
There it goes again.
You remember Feisty McKenna?
Only with him, it wasn't harp noises.
He kept hearing birdcalls.
Easy, easy, easy.
Now, easy.
Okay.
Well.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Mr. Hawk!
This is the fire chief speaking!
We'll have everything under control in just a moment.
Now, Mr. Hawk, try to relax.
Relax?
How can I relax, you fathead?
Mary Lou,
I wish you'd come over.
Pop's putting on a great show.
They're bringing in a net.
Make way. Come on.
Come down sitting.
Not feet first!
The net didn't work so well, Mary Lou.
I told you we needed a new one.
You told me?
What do you think I've been telling the council?
How am I supposed to buy a net without an appropriation?
Don't get hot.
I only mentioned it.
You just keep the kinks out of the fire hose.
That's all I want from you.
I'm the chief.
Sure! Come on over, Millie!
You should see it.
Don't worry, Mr. Hawk.
We'll take care of you.
No, don't do it!
No!
Ow!
Personally,
I'm a dry-fly man, myself.
Royal Coachman.
- Take it easy.
- Yeah, I got him.
Biff! Help me!
Do something before they kill me!
Coach, I know you're in spring practice.
But it's a matter of life and death!
That ain't no birdcall.
Well, look who's here.
It's the professor.
It wasn't smart breaking in like that.
Well, I didn't exactly break in.
Of course, as you can see,
I'm trying to break out.
Careful, boys.
Look!
What happened, boys?
You missed me?
Here I am!
Now, take it easy, boys.
Take it easy.
Don't crowd me!
Don't want to get tough with you again.
Barrel-fresh hot doggies!
They're a foot long!
Get your hot doggies!
Right this way!
Here we are, folks.
Hot dogs.
And you called the police?
Certainly. I was getting ready to take a bath.
I saw this face flashing past the window.
How did I know the poor man was in trouble?
Back!
Well, sir, I calculate he gains about 18 inches to bounce.
And your opinion is?
About 7:00 tonight, he's gonna be in serious trouble.
Gosh. My father never does anything like that.
For a parent, he's way out!
Excuse me, excuse me.
This way, fellas.
Son! What are you going to do to me?
One, two...
Biff! I'm your father!
Please!
Hike!
Pop!
Are you all right, Pop?
And why wouldn't I be?
The warehouse!
Oh, no. Once more, and we'd have had it open.
You're not gonna give up this easily.
It's just a bump on the head.
That's it. Come on.
What would Mr. Hawk say?
Come on, let's get on our feet.
On with the fight. Come on.
Here. Try this.
Oh. Thank you, dear.
That did it. Better get back in the car, Betsy.
All right, come on, you cut-rate gorillas!
- Hit him high this time.
- Got you.
Okay, Mr. Jumping Jack.
Look out!
Ned!
Corners beautifully, doesn't it?
Ned, look!
Here they come!
Come on, you guys!
Get in the car! Hurry up!
To think I always thought of you as a nice, easygoing college professor.
- Betsy?
- Mm-hmm?
No. This is hardly the time to say what I was going to say.
Never mind.
Go ahead. Say it.
Well...
What do you know?
They want to play rough.
Here. Give me that thing!
You can't do that, Pop!
We gotta show this nut we mean business!
Well, looky there.
A police car.
Well, well, well.
They've been asking for it.
Asking for what?
The Shelby Stomp.
It's Brainard!
- Faster, son!
- I've got it down to the floor!
- Hold it!
- All right!
All right, you birds!
Get your hands on the top of that car.
Now, this is ridiculous!
Do you realize who I am?
Yeah. You're the guy that had this hot pistol in his mitt.
I'm Alonzo P. Hawk, president of the Auld Lang Syne finance company!
Isn't it a small world?
Why, of course I remember you.
Well, that's better.
Sure, you're the outfit that repossessed my electric icebox last year.
Well, Officer Hanson!
Sorry, but can you tell me the shortest way to Washington, D.C.?
Sure, Professor.
Down the block to the intersection, left, Highway 9.
No, I mean as the crow flies.
Oh! That way.
Due East.
Thanks.
Officer, stop that man!
He's flying off with millions of dollars that belong to me!
Mr. Hawk, surely you're not accusing dear, old Professor...
I have an unknown approaching
Washington prohibited zone.
Heading 0-6-8.
Angels 1.5.
Speed 45 knots.
45 knots?
Are you sure?
Yes, sir.
Hello, Bird Farm?
This is Flag Down.
Scramble the 5-minute birds.
Attention, attention.
Scramble Bird Dog flight.
Scramble Bird Dog flight.
Vector 2-7-0.
Vector 2-7-0.
Go gate to angels 1.5.
Angels 1.5.
It's so lovely and peaceful up here.
As though we're the only people in the world.
Well, aren't we?
Ned.
Ned!
Did you see what I saw?
- I hope not!
- Let's run that again.
Roger.
Here they come again!
Let's get out of here!
Hello, Flag Down.
This is Bird Dog Leader.
I have a visual on that bogey.
Well, speak up, man.
What is it?
I don't think you're going to like this, sir.
What's the matter?
Give me that bogey report!
It's a Model T, sir.
A what?
A Model T Touring Car.
Only it's flying!
Bird Dog Leader,
I suggest for your own sake that you take another look.
I can't, sir.
It's gone into a cloud.
And it won't come out!
What's the procedure, sir?
I think I'll let the colonel handle this one.
Yes, Flag Down?
Well, go on, Captain.
Go on.
A flying what?
Cut the clowning Flag Down.
The C.O.'s here.
- What's going on, Colonel?
- Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing?
It's Flag Down.
Just a question of procedure.
Give me that.
What's all this?
Don't you know your job, man?
Don't interrupt me.
It might interest you to know the general staff has worked out exact procedure for every possible situation.
There's nothing could happen...
A flying what?
- Looks like they've gone.
- Good.
Can we get out of here now?
This is ruining my hairset.
Darling, you never looked more beautiful.
Gentlemen.
It's quite simple, really.
Obviously, a Model T cannot fly.
It must be something disguised as a Model T.
I am declaring a Condition Yellow.
Let's move, Colonel.
How lovely it is.
Makes you feel proud, doesn't it?
Washington's a great city.
There's something for everyone.
Look at all those people down there!
I think they're staring at us.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
I can't hear what they're yelling.
Hi, down there!
Oh, Ned!
Look out!
Kind of hits you between the eyes, doesn't it?
Look!
There's Grant's Tomb.
I think Grant's Tomb is in New York, dear.
I believe that's the Jefferson Memorial.
You mean Monticello?
Betsy, I think there's a map in the side pocket.
Will you see if you can find the Pentagon?
It has five sides and a big parking lot.
I doubt if it's on here, dear.
This map is from the year 1917.
Hmm? Oh!
Well.
Oh, there's the Capitol!
Won't that do?
The Capitol.
When you think of all the history made there.
Now, don't forget, you're making history right now.
Oh, you think so?
I hope they don't make a fuss.
We interrupt to bring you an emergency bulletin.
This is the commanding officer,
Sector Air Defense, speaking on all commercial and military wavelengths.
Attention!
An unidentified flying object is over the city.
I don't see anything.
No. Nothing up here but us.
Every defensive missile
- in the area
- Us!
Is trained on the flying object.
If it does not identify itself, it will be shot down immediately.
They wouldn't dare!
Oh, yes.
Yes, they'd dare.
This is your last warning.
Identify yourself or we will open fire.
Ready at Fort Mead?
Missile batteries locked on target, sir.
Repeat!
Are you listening, unidentified flying object?
We are waiting for your response!
I am responding!
I'm Professor Brainard!
At the count of 10, we open fire.
Don't bother to count, general!
I'm an American!
See? My credit cards!
Three...
Four...
Wait!
You're not gonna stand for that, are you?
Five...
Yes.
Six...
Seven...
Sir, Fort Mead reports he's gone behind the Capitol dome.
- Eight...
- Congress is in session.
If you fire, we might lose every senator and congressman.
Nine...
And they've just put a new front on the building.
Hold your fire.
Well, why try to pass the buck to me?
Just because it looks like a...
What?
Well, I don't care if it is a Model T!
Shoot it down!
Right, right.
And if you happen to see a Stutz Bearcat or a Pope-Toledo flying over the Capitol, shoot them down, too.
As a personal favor, won't you please identify yourself?
Professor, this is the admiral.
Proceed to Anacostia
Naval Air Station.
This is General Singer.
You fly to Bolling
Air Force Base.
This is the Army.
Report to Fort Myer.
- Anacostia Naval Air Station!
- Bolling Air Force Base!
- Bolling Air Force Base!
- Fort Myer!
Now hear this!
Anacostia.
They had their chance.
I'm not gonna fool around.
What are you doing?
We're going to land.
On that big patch of green lawn.
- Oh, Ned. Not there, please!
- Why not?
Well, my hair is a mess!
And I haven't a thing to wear!
Anybody home?
Ned!
Professor, what did the president have to say?
Well...
The president, devoted to the advance of science, has embraced the discovery of Flubber with enthusiasm.
Professor, what branch of the services will be given control of your new discovery?
Well...
All will share alike.
In our opinion,
Flubber will only cement the great traditional ties of interservice cooperation.
Professor, with this great breakthrough in science, do you feel you still have other worlds to conquer?
I do.
Just so there's no doubt about it, would you mind repeating that?
I do.
With pleasure, and a deep sense of accomplishment,
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Firecracker!
Firecracker! Sis-boom-bah!
Medfield! Medfield!
Rah, rah, rah!
Goodbye, Betsy!
Good luck!
The radio won't work!
Why not?
We're getting abnormal interference!
From what? The storm?
It's more like a brain wave.
A brain wave?
How can that interfere with the radio?
What's that?
It's Godzilla!
Change course! Change course!
The interference is gone.
It's gone? How?
Maybe because we're out of its course.
Was Godzilla the cause?
No, the interference came from 7 o'clock.
Seven o'clock?
There's nothing there.
Wait a minute.
Here's a strange island.
- Sollgel Island.
- Sollgel? What's that?
Never heard of it, but look.
Godzilla's headed for that island.
Something must be calling him there.
What could be on Sollgel Island?
Shall we begin?
Go ahead.
Hello. Check party.
Stand by to check capsule two.
HQ listening. Over.
The time is 0836 hours.
Temperature, humidity, same as at capsule one.
All other systems normal.
Don't be lazy!
It's the old man!
Oh, professor!
Each inspection is very important.
Don't be negligent.
Yes. Yes, sir.
That old man is hard to deal with.
He's not the only thing that's hard to deal with.
This stupid heat.
I don't know how much more I can take.
Damn it. Again.
He's gone.
This isn't a place for men.
WFPO Sollgel Island
- Did you report an irregularity?
- Yes.
- What's wrong?
- The bearing...
Replace it.
Everything needs to be perfect.
- Why did I come here?
- You volunteered.
Yes, it's a scientific honor...
...to work for the great Professor Kusumi.
Then don't complain.
But I can't be as sharp as he demands all the time.
- I miss Japanese food.
- Be patient.
- Interference.
- What? Again?
Locate the source!
Damn it. It's gone!
- Where did it come from?
- About 7 o'clock.
What could be causing the interference?
I have no idea.
What?
- That must be a care package.
- No.
Nobody knows about our plan other than the WFPO.
Then it's a WFPO plane.
Hello there.
Thanks for coming to meet me.
My luggage is there.
Thanks a lot.
Who are you?
I'm Goro Maki...
...a freelance reporter.
Go home.
- That's ridiculous!
- You're ridiculous.
I'm not moving an inch until I have a story.
I refuse.
- Do you still insist?
- Yes.
We don't need any publicity.
Who said I was doing this for your publicity?
I'm working for myself.
The smell of a story...
- The smell of a story?
- Yes.
The smell of a story attracts me.
The readers will decide whether to read it or not.
I report what I see.
Just like you, professor.
You'd do anything for your research.
Don't be silly.
How about this?
We can't just send him swimming home.
So why don't we have him help us.
We could use another man.
Even having him do the cooking and cleaning would be a load off of us.
- Wait a minute!
- Would you rather swim home?
Well?
How long do you intend to wear your life jacket?
You're one of us now.
Cook well.
- What's that sound?
- You'll see.
A huge mantis.
Keep out of the jungle at night!
Mr. Fujisaki!
Did you find the mantis?
- Mantis?
- Yes.
Concentrate on your cooking.
- Any news or fun?
- There's nothing fun here.
Mr. Furukawa's pretty frustrated.
Yeah, he is...
...but everyone's frustrated, more or less.
Why?
We've been confined on this eerie island for over a month.
I see. I'd like to hear some of your eerie stories.
- What's that?
- Vegetables.
- That's the bath!
- I know. Nobody's bathed yet.
Morio was washing those in there this morning.
Hey.
What are we having tonight?
- Dehydrated vegetables again?
- They've been specially seasoned.
- Feed us some fresh ones.
- Are there fresh vegetables here?
Sure. We call it Sollgel parsley.
There's not a lot left around camp, but you'll find a lot in the jungle.
The weather conditions are becoming favorable, sir.
This low pressure here worries me.
It shouldn't be a problem.
The area of high pressure will push it north.
In other words, tomorrow may be the perfect day to run our experiment.
Professor?
An experiment to freeze this island?
Wait and see.
- What about the native girl?
- A girl?
There are no natives.
I saw a young girl.
But we've checked thoroughly.
You could've missed her.
- Help her.
- Enough!
Don't interfere with us.
I just want to get this experiment over with and get out of here!
Professor, is this experiment so important?
It is.
Mankind's future depends on it.
As you know, the world population is reaching a limit.
You know why?
The food supply. There won't be enough food to feed the population.
So we must start thinking about currently uncultivated lands.
The Siberian tundras, the African deserts, the South American jungles...
They're useless now.
But if we can control the weather and make those lands fertile...
...we can avoid mass starvation.
Is that possible?
Theoretically, yes.
That's what we're experimenting.
I have one question.
Why must the experiment be conducted in secret?
Don't you see?
If someone abused our system, they could also freeze the entire world.
The results would be the same as a nuclear holocaust.
We'll conduct the experiment tomorrow.
Everybody, be on standby.
No wind, few clouds.
Temperature 34 degrees Celsius, humidity 60 percent.
Twenty minutes before launch!
- Five minutes before launch.
- The reporter?
- I thought he was around.
- Alert him.
Two minutes before launch.
Return immediately, Maki.
Hey! Come out!
Come out, quickly! Please!
Thirty seconds before launch!
Ten seconds...
...nine, eight...
...seven, six, five, four, three...
...two, one. Launch.
Launch freezing balloon.
Refrigeration gas, negative 115 degrees Celsius.
The balloon's altitude, 350 meters.
Four hundred.
- Detonate it at 800.
- Five hundred.
Six hundred.
Six hundred fifty.
Seven hundred.
Seven hundred fifty.
- Eight hundred.
- Detonate.
Warm air is ascending, sir.
Capsules, standby.
Release silver iodide.
Damn it!
The temperature has descended to 29 degrees Celsius.
So far, so good.
Just as we calculated.
- Has Maki returned?
- He'll come back shivering.
Temperature falling rapidly.
It's currently at 25 degrees Celsius.
Stop cooling. Stand by for heating.
Launch the radioactive balloon.
The radio controls aren't responding.
Professor!
- We can't control the capsules!
- What's the cause? The cause?
We're getting interference.
- Can we get the balloon back?
- No, sir.
If it explodes too soon...
We'll get a reverse reaction.
The upper atmosphere will work like a convex lens.
- Are the controls working now?
- No good.
Thus, sunlight converged on Sollgel Island.
The temperature rose to 70 degrees Celsius.
Then came the thunderstorms.
Hot rain came in torrents.
Four days later, it finally cooled to 37 degrees Celsius.
Tell all the men...
- At last, it cooled a little.
- We were nearly baked.
- So the experiment is over.
- I don't think so.
I know the old man well.
He's encouraged by hardships.
Everyone, over here!
A message from the professor.
We are to do a systems check and damage reports immediately.
Is the experiment still on?
He didn't say.
He only ordered a systems check.
- At the inlet down there.
- What?
A girl was swimming.
With that heat, she's sure to be dead now.
Don't you believe me?
You might have been hallucinating.
Professor!
Professor, how did it get that big?
Maybe because of the heat and radioactivity.
Let's go back.
Damn it.
Capsule one is over there.
We'll call for help from there.
It's out!
Get inside.
Professor!
Professor, what are they doing?
The interference waves we got came from over there.
An egg!
According to the reports, we can finish the repairs in 10 days.
- In addition...
- I object! I object.
We can't continue...
Who are opposed?
Professor, you should continue your research.
You have no say.
You're not a member of this team!
You must be kidding me.
I was admitted as a cook.
Hold it. Fighting won't do any good.
Furukawa, we can't get off this island.
The heat ruined our radio.
We can't even call for a rescue ship.
How soon can you fix it?
I'm not sure yet, but it could take a while.
Continue the repairs in the morning.
Meeting adjourned.
You're pretty good.
- I know you broke the radio.
- Well...
- The kitchen!
- What's happening?
- What is it?
- My shirt is gone.
Something's on a tree.
Light the tree behind me.
No!
You saw her, didn't you?
That's the girl I saw.
I'm impressed that she's still alive.
Kamacuras?
The mutant mantis.
Maki named them last night.
Journalists are good at naming things.
Morio, what kind of egg do you think that is?
I have no idea.
It's being cracked!
It broke open!
A baby Godzilla!
What an unfair fight!
Watch out!
- What's going on?
- He insists on going home.
Furukawa, have you gone mad?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong?
It's Godzilla!
Come on!
Everybody, run!
Godzilla is coming!
Quick! Over there!
- Godzilla's come to help!
- Wait a minute.
The radio interference was the baby's cry.
All right!
No time to cheer. Let's get out of here before we get hurt.
That way!
Over here. Come on.
This will pep you up.
It's you.
- You thief.
- Thief?
Are you Japanese?
- But I'm not a thief.
- You're stealing my things!
You're the thief.
This is my shirt.
You lie! Boys don't wear red shirts like this. Or are you a girl?
I'm a boy. My name's Goro.
And yours?
Saeko.
Saeko, huh?
I'm with the scientists.
I'm not a thief.
I'm not a thief either. Here.
- You can keep it.
- Really?
You'll really give it to me?
But what are you doing on an island, all alone like this?
The radio's really out of order this time.
Well, let's check the other equipment.
Listen, everybody.
From now on...
The reporter! Are you all right?
We were worried.
Sorry.
Professor, I want you to meet someone.
Come on.
This is Ms. Saeko Matsumiya.
Matsumiya?
Take a look at this.
Her father was an archaeologist.
"1955, Sollgel Island,
Tadashi Matsumiya."
- Matsumiya?
- Do you know him?
No. But 20 years ago, when the
Japanese pulled out of the Pacific...
...there was an archaeologist who stayed behind on one of the islands.
That's right.
It was Dr. Matsumiya.
He died on this island seven years ago.
And your mother?
She died when I was born.
Oh, I see.
Well, you've done very well alone here.
It's Kamacuras!
Hurry up! lt'll ruin the equipment.
- You've got to head it off.
- Right!
This way!
All right, it's gone.
It's too dangerous to stay here.
How about this?
Why don't we move the equipment into her cave.
- A cave?
- Yes.
It's safer and cooler than here.
That's how she survived that intense heat.
All right, let's go.
- Right.
- Hurry up.
Goro, you gave up!
And you call yourself a man.
What do you mean?
There's not a man in Tokyo who can run faster than you.
Tokyo? What kind of place is it?
What kind of place?
Well, it's a man-made jungle.
Jungle?
- Goro, are you going back there?
- Yeah.
- You'll come too.
- Really?
- It was your father's home.
- Oh, wonderful!
Saeko! It's Godzilla!
It's all right. He's only a baby.
We're friends.
Hey, come back!
It's really harmless.
See?
Saeko! It's the big one!
Fujisaki.
What's a Kumonga?
Kumonga?
I'm reading Matsumiya's notes and that name keeps popping up.
Kumonga?
I have absolutely no idea.
Morio.
I feel so hot.
My body is burning up!
Professor, he's got a high fever.
Everybody's got it. They're outside.
- Tashiro, what's the matter?
- I'm hot.
Furukawa, what happened?
- They've all got a high fever.
- Let's get them inside.
All right, come on.
We're all out of medicine.
It's some kind of tropical disease.
What do we do?
We may get it too.
I know something to make them better.
- What is it?
- The warm, red water.
- Warm, red water?
- Yes.
If you drink it, the fever will go away.
- All right, I'll go get it.
- You can't.
That's where Godzilla is.
And on the way, you must pass
Kumonga's valley.
Saeko, just what is this "Kumonga"?
It's a giant spider.
Godzilla and his baby, Kamacuras and now Kumonga.
This is a monster island.
But Kumonga is sleeping now.
If we don't wake him up, we won't have any trouble.
I'll leave now.
Wait.
You can't go out there alone.
- Don't worry.
- I'll go with you.
Goro.
According to
Dr. Matsumiya's notes...
...the web of the Kumonga can only be cut by heat.
By heat?
- It's a good thing to know.
- I understand.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Goro. Take a gun with you.
Be careful.
This is where Kumonga lives.
Where Kumonga lives?
- Well, where is it?
- Underground, sleeping.
Be careful!
This is going to be dangerous.
Damn it, he knows we're here.
No, he's educating his son.
He's educating it?
Just like the education fanatics in Japan.
What's that?
They don't let their children play.
Poor kids.
Perhaps.
The baby spit fire?
Yes, it's growing really fast.
Furukawa!
- Watch out!
- I'm going home!
Stop it!
Give me the gun!
Professor, are you all right?
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.
- Does it hurt?
- No.
I'll get you herbs tomorrow.
Thank you.
Fujisaki, you'd better repair the radio soon.
Professor, you mean...?
With things the way they are now, we must give up the experiment.
The red water was really effective.
Everyone is cured.
They're still a little woozy, but their fevers are gone.
That's good.
How is Furukawa?
Well, he regrets what he did.
Where's Saeko?
She went to get herbs for me.
Saeko!
Saeko! Come on!
Let's run for it.
Let's go.
- It's Kumonga!
- Come on!
That's it!
Between those rocks!
Saeko, climb up!
Quietly.
Oh, it's the professor.
What are you doing, sir?
Oh, you two.
Changing the melted cords, but it's very hard.
You haven't give up, have you?
Would you just loaf if there were no news?
No, I'd have to do something.
It's the same with me.
We have a poor nature.
Lie down and hide!
Is that Kumonga?
That was close.
Dinner will be ready soon.
Oh, good.
- Everyone, come quick!
- What's wrong?
- We can't get out.
- What?
Kumonga's outside spinning a web!
Has it given up, professor?
No, it's waiting for us to come out.
It's fixed! The radio is repaired!
Send an S.O.S.
- We can't.
- Why not?
We have to put the antenna outside.
Damn it!
We can go out.
- Really?
- Yes.
This tunnel opens to the sea.
We can swim outside.
So that's how you disappeared that time.
- I'll go.
- Me too.
All right.
Look.
Let's hurry.
- Keep away!
- Go back!
Come on.
Watch out.
Look out, Morio!
Move over there. Quickly.
Morio, be careful!
- What's going on?
- It's bad.
Kumonga and Godzilla's son are fighting!
If the father comes, this cave will be crushed!
Let's start the experiment.
- We can't move anyway.
- But...
Let's freeze the monsters.
All right?
But will it work?
Let's hope so.
We still have enough material left.
We made contact.
A rescue ship has been sent to us.
How about the experiment?
Let's do it.
All of you, will you do it?
Hurry to your posts.
All right, let's get started.
What should we do?
Let's get the lifeboat ready.
Now, one, two, three!
Freezing unit ready to go.
Electric generators standing by.
How is the weather?
We can't wait around, but it doesn't look too bad.
Starting the countdown.
Minus 180 seconds.
Sixty seconds.
Minus 10 seconds.
Nine, eight, seven, six...
...five, four, three...
...two, one.
Launch the refrigeration balloon.
Five hundred, 550.
Six hundred.
Six-fifty.
Seven hundred.
Detonate the unit.
Release silver iodide.
Ready the radioactive unit.
Launch.
- Interference.
- Not again.
- How's the remote control working?
- No trouble yet.
The interference is gone.
Either Godzilla's given up or he's been killed by the other monsters.
- Detonate capsule at 1000 meters.
- Roger.
- Altitude?
- Six hundred fifty.
Seven hundred.
It's at 900.
Nine hundred fifty.
One thousand.
All right, detonate!
Saeko, look.
It seems to be a success.
The temperature has fallen three degrees Celsius.
No, five degrees.
It's going down fast.
We've done it.
Professor!
The monsters have moved away.
That means we can leave!
The temperature is negative 5 degrees Celsius.
- Switch to automatic control.
- Roger.
All right, let's get to the beach.
Hurry!
Hey, it's snowing!
It's snow!
Professor...
Professor!
All right, let's move on out.
Poor Godzilla.
They won't die.
They'll just hibernate.
Hibernate?
They'll sleep until the snow melts.
Anybody see the ship?
Hey, what's that?
It's coming this way!
Hey, it's the ship!
Why didn't they tell us they were sending a submarine?
They scared me half to death!
They'll live peacefully after the snow melts.
Let's go inside.
Goodbye.

Forced out of orbital velocity to avoid collision with planetoid... and into tighter orbit of Mars.
The gravity of the planet's pulling us toward it.
We've gotta blast back into orbital velocity.
- Use all our fuel.
- That problem we can lick later.
Gravity pull has risen to 9.30.

This is Commander Christopher Draper... the Navy of the United States of America, planet Earth...
former copilot
Mars Gravity Probe 1.
On our third orbit of this planet... we took evasive action to avoid collision with a meteor... and were forced into dangerous gravitational pull of Mars.
We were forced to abandon ship.
As of now, the vehicle frame is still orbiting Mars.
Seems to have established gravitational balance.
[Air Hissing]
[Hissing Stops]
We ejected capsule without incident...
Colonel Dan McReady ejecting after I did.
I'll set out to look for him tomorrow.
From all indications, he should be on the other side of a high range of rocky peaks to the west.
Now, my two most difficult problems are air and water.
I have, with what's left in my tank and one reserve cylinder, enough oxygen for... oh, about 60 hours... depending, of course, on how much I exert myself.
My first discovery was that the air on Mars is far too thin to support human life.
As to water, by severe rationing,
I can get by for about 15 days.
Course, once my air gives out, water won't matter.
First positive survival point:
I found a yellow rock.
It's as burnable as some of our poorer grades of coal.
Heat's uneven, but it should make the Martian nights endurable.
[Air Hissing]
I feel a little bit like Columbus... set down in a strange new land... full of new wonders... new discoveries.
It's a challenge, all right - a challenge to my training.
Sometimes challenges can get mighty big.
But I'm gonna stay alive, believe me.
That's for the morale officer.

Well, I've licked the heat and shelter problem.
Breathing - that's a different story.
Moving about, exerting myself,
I've found that I can... breathe the air of Mars for about, oh, 12 to 15 minutes... before I need to take air from my tank for a booster.
Lying down, asleep... inactive, I can get by for an hour before taking a booster.
In this way, with some discomfort,
I can conserve my oxygen supply.
At the most optimistic appraisal...
I have 50 or so hours of life left...
God willing.
The problem is sleeping.
If I don't wake up in time to renew my air supply, it's hearts and flowers.
I've got to make some kind of alarm device, safeguard myself.
[Clangs]
Tomorrow - and morning's only a couple of hours away-
I'm gonna rejoin Mac.
Good old Mac.
I'll bet he's got these problems licked.

I've found an answer that's saved my life temporarily.
These yellow stones that burn like coal.
I've been wondering about this a lot.
Where do they get the oxygen to burn?
It must be similar to solid rocket fuel with its own built-in oxygen.
Heat and flame release it.
And it's breathable.
I've gotta find some way to store it.
As far as life on this planet...
I've seen no sign of any other living thing anywhere... yet.

Good old Woodward.
You used to be about as interesting as a common brick.
Now, Professor,
I'm glad to have you aboard.
This second phase of survival, finding water... will deal with locating water on another planet.
Since no one has landed on another planet yet -
- Oh, is that so?
- We will have to proceed... with hypothetical knowledge from our studies here on Earth.
- I can give you a tip from here on Mars.
- Water is where you find it.
Like gold.
The thing is to know where to find it.
And you must make sure it's potable.
- Don't drink seawater.
- No seas here.
Seawater's too salty.
So's urine.
- [Squawks]
- Rain and snow... become groundwater and sink in under the ground.
- No rain. No snow.
- On some dry, desert planets... it may be possible to crush rocks... and extract latent water from them.
Good night, Professor.

Boy, here's where he'll crack.
Here's where he'll go under.
I know, I know. I had great training, including two months in the isolation chamber.

Last night occurred the most important event since I landed on Mars 147 days ago.
An interplanetary space vehicle made a landing... like no space vehicle
I've ever seen on Earth.
From what I see from my videotape...
it was manned by some animated beings, obviously from some planet other than Mars.
They're here, apparently, on an ore-gathering expedition.
They mine electronically by remote control.
They also use slaves, and they handle them electronically.
One of them escaped.
He's with me.
And I'm trying to establish communication with him.
He's pretty much like an Earth being... except he's completely mute.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil-"
Friday talk.
Huh.
Friday talk. A-okay?
Yeah. A-okay.
But don't just copy me.
Not copy you.
No. You tell me something.
Tell me what's inside you.
Tell me, uh, for instance, where do you live? What planet?
Where's your home?
Home?
- Home.
- No, no, no.
Home.
Weetawin.
We call that group of stars Orion.
Osatanango.
You come from the center star in the belt of Orion.
We call that Alnilam, which I'm sure is very interesting to you.
I come from over there... just around the corner from you.
Come on.
Keep the conversation going.
- Enemy.
- Yeah?
Come back.
When?
- Soon.
- How soon?
Sixty suns.
Sixty suns. That's two months.
They're overdue.
They can find you with these?
- Enemy find Friday?
- Enemy come.
We've gotta figure out some way of getting these things off.
[Draper On Recording] For the survival record,
I've been taking Friday's oxygen pills.
Chemically, of course,
I have no way of analyzing them.
As to how they work, I've noticed that I inhale and exhale...
and use the thin Martian atmosphere.
- [Beeping]
- But I don't need it.
- [Beeping Speeds Up]
- [Pulsating Tones]
Somehow, these pills bypass the lungs and produce oxygen right in the blood.
[Beeping Continues]
- [Pulsating Screeching]
- [Gasps]
Enemy! Enemy!
[Mona Screeching]
[Pulsating Screeching Continues]
Get the gear together!
[Mona Squawking]
[Laser Shot Fires]
[Squawking Continues]
[Laser Shot Fires]
[Laser Shot Fires]
This way good. A-okay.
[Chirping]
Yes, Friday? What is it?
[Native Language]
This Quiquay Tanango.
You call Mars.
Yes, Mars.
Those look like the canals of Mars.
You mean these are part of the canals of Mars?
[Native Language]
I get it. Some kind of earthquake or volcano opened up these fissures?
And the crust above sagged?
- And those are the canals above us?
- Canals.
They must go on for hundreds of miles.
They'll be our underground highway... our bomb shelter.
And somewhere we'll come out again and make a new home.
What's been done before can be done again.
[Beeping]
[Pulsating Tones, Screeching]
[Beeping Continues]
- [Pulsating Screeching]
- [Shouts]
[Squawking]
- [Screeching Stops]
- Well, they know where we are.
But they can't get at us.
I'll get this damn thing off as soon as I can.
[Squawking, Chirping]
[Squawking]
[Friday]
Water gone.
[Draper]
We'll have to go up to the surface.
[Draper]
The polar ice cap.
Water. Much water.
[Pulsating Tones, Screeching]
You go. Friday stay.
- Why?
- Enemy.
We're sticking together, buddy.
- Buddy?
- Yeah. Slang for "brother." Come on.
[Squawks]
Water. Water.
Gotta find water.
If we don't find water pretty soon -
Rut Mona down.
She can walk to the ice cap as well as we can.
- [Chittering]
- [Draper] Come on, Mona.
[Friday]
Rest here.
Not long... reach ice cap.
[Draper]
Not too far to the snow now, baby.
Rest - Rest here.
When's the last time you took an oxygen pill?
Give me those.
I thought you said we had 12 left.
You've been holding out on yourself, haven't you, hmm? Saving them for me.
No wonder you're weak.
Here. Here!
I'll take charge of these.
Bring Mona.
Water! Friday, water!
[Gasping, Laughing]
[Friday]
Not too much. Cold.
[Laughs]
Yeah, you're right.
I tell you, Mona, she know.
Yeah, you bet she does.
Oh, thank God for water.
God?
God.
Yeah.
Supreme Being.
Uh, Father of the universe.
Big Father. Big Father!
Kaihechipek.
We say Kaihechipek.
Order.
Kaihechipek.
Order. God.
Good.
Yeah. That's right.
Divine order. Good.
- Mona keep warm.
- [Chittering]
Looks like the only way out of here is up.
Friday!
[Mona Squawking]
[Chittering, Whimpering]
Dig, Friday. Dig!
Mona sick. Need fire.
- She cold.
- We'll all freeze if we don't get a shelter built.
Our bodies'll keep us warm, just like the Eskimos.
Come on! Keep digging!
How long have you had that thing on?
- Sixty-two years.
- What?
- How old are you, anyway?
- Seventy-eight.
[Rumbling]
Look out!
[Rumbling]
- Forget it.
- Friday, no.
God not forget.
- [Rumbling Continues]
- [Explosion In Distance]
[Rumbling Continues]
[Explosions Continue]
Quick.
Get that equipment out of the water.
Mona. Where Mona?
[Beeping]
[Beeping Speeds Up]
Here they come again.
Not enemy.
- Different.
- [Static, Frequency Tuning]
[Man] Space Rescue Group 3 to
Earth Satellite. One more fact to report.
The meteor that struck Mars is melting the polar ice cap.
Not enemy.
Talk like you!
Like me! Like me, Friday!
- [Static, Frequency Tuning]
- [Beeping Continues]
Uh, this is
Commander Christopher Draper... of the United States Navy.
[Man On Radio]
My God! A voice from Mars!
[Squawking]
Hey! Hey! Hey, yahoo! Whoo!
[Squawking]
{210}{299}ANDROMEDA NEBULA|adapted from a novel by Ivan YEFREMOV
{670}{760}You, the elders, accept my skill and desire!
{765}{870}Accept my labor, and teach me|through the day and the night!
{874}{955}Extend a hand of guidance,|since the way is difficult!
{958}{1018}And I will follow you!
{1442}{1515}You, the elders, accept my skill and desire!
{1517}{1562}Accept my labor...
{1565}{1671}- Good day, Mven Mas!|- A, Junius! Good day!
{1674}{1766}- Do you take part in the celebration?|- I am sent by the Council of Astro Navigation.
{1770}{1860}We looked the entire day for you|throughout the whole planet, and here you are.
{1864}{1995}The is a time of Herculean effort.|This young man selected me to be his teacher.
{2015}{2110}Mven, I am not alone, there are members of Council.
{2113}{2227}They would like to talk with you.|They are there, on helicopter pad.
{2230}{2320}Well. I will be right back.
{2650}{2880}The Council wants you, Mven, to accept the post|of the manager of the external stations of Great Ring.
{2943}{3012}- But Dar Veter?|- He is retiring.
{3095}{3149}Must I answer now?
{3150}{3291}Tomorrow is next reception from the Great Ring,|it's good opportunity for the change.
{3346}{3460}I am going to the observatory today,|I only have to finish ceremony here.
{3476}{3583}Well, we know, mentor-teacher.
{3589}{3780}Yeh, I will be busyer now,|but we all have entered adulthood.
{3791}{3865}My teacher was Erg Noor.
{3903}{4017}By the way, are there any news about "Tantra"?
{4021}{4102}The program of 37th Star Expedition is completed.
{4112}{4212}"Al'Graab" with anameson went towards "Tantra".
{4214}{4277}And if encounter took place...

{4530}{4635}Music by Yakov Lapinskiy|Sound engineer Nikolai Trakhtenberg
{5925}{5974}The field stress is twice|as high as calculated.
{5976}{6055}- We must reduce our speed.|- You mean, decellerate?
{6143}{6220}But how then accelerate our flight?|We will lack anameson!
{6222}{6266}Make a decision, Pel!
{6268}{6332}The Commander will be awake|in only three hours!
{6342}{6395}Switch on planetary engines!
{6509}{6545}Ingrid!
{6625}{6713}What a swift growth of gravity!
{6755}{6920}What is there in front?|Just darkness! Only darkness!
{6956}{7109}But, here there's nothing,|here there can't be anything!
{7132}{7211}This region has has not been explored, Pel.
{7267}{7363}Switch front screens to the infrared!
{7394}{7440}Stop engines!
{7563}{7609}What a fool I am!
{7638}{7762}I was convinced that we are near the dark cloud! But this...
{7797}{7905}Yes, this is an iron star!
{8002}{8038}Congratulations, Pel!
{8059}{8144}You discovered it in place, where|no one suspected its existence!
{8170}{8216}If we had only caught earlier!
{8290}{8353}Now we can't escape from its gravitational pull!
{8358}{8500}Awake! Wake up the entire crew immediately!
{9200}{9265}-Good day!|- Good day!
{9350}{9415}-Good day!|- Good day!
{9865}{9925}I still don't understand his decision.
{9939}{9997}Couldn't the Council really convince him?
{10023}{10135}Is there a rule, to persuade man|to do what he does not want to do?
{10165}{10256}Yes, but Dar Veter has for six years|led the external stations.
{10569}{10628}Preventive throughout entire Earth!
{10662}{10897}Power plants, all factories,|net transport and radio stations!
{11248}{11292}Good day, Veter!
{11310}{11370}Well, is it all decided?
{11425}{11470}Decided!
{11500}{11578}I am glad, Veter. You should rest.
{11644}{11710}It is, probably hard to understand.
{11745}{11900}It is hard until you experience|something similar yourself.
{12037}{12165}The manner, the manner, by which you lived...
{12207}{12273}which is given by society...
{12302}{12471}this way suddenly becomes,|for you, not so important.
{12520}{12552}Not only...
{12560}{12659}Veter, do you have time? Are you free now?
{12669}{12741}I will come to you! Wait!
{13032}{13140}- You are too unforgiving of yourself.|- Unforgiving?
{13174}{13310}But if you can object, ignore what others say,
{13318}{13394}don't note, that you begin|to believe only to yourself...
{13397}{13507}No, at whatever position you will find this illness,
{13511}{13580}it is necessary to immediately change the work.
{13585}{13635}Doctors say that.
{13635}{13735}I say it myself, doctors only confirm it.
{13905}{13940}Veda!
{13978}{14095}Stop it, Veter! "Tantra" did not return yet.
{14517}{14556}But I love you!
{14626}{14750}You forgot, Veter! There is Erg Noor.
{14878}{14945}Do you still love him?
{14965}{15008}No, I do not love.
{15103}{15216}Then you are free. What holds you back? What?
{15340}{15502}I am convinced, convinced that each of you...
{15561}{15651}will worthily meet all tests, that may befall our path.
{15689}{15808}As an astronaut. As an citizen of Earth.
{15901}{16030}I was able to deflect the spaceship,|and we will not crash into the iron star.
{16095}{16230}But it will be impossible for us|to escape from its gravitational pull.
{16288}{16418}An encounter with "Al'Graab" did not take place,|and entire anameson was spent to the braking.
{16506}{16626}We are now captive to this star.
{16694}{16810}I do not ask your for advice,|I already made a decision.
{16827}{16892}This star has two planets.
{16905}{17030}We will orbit one of them,|gather signal flare,
{17038}{17135}send it to the Earth and await rescue.
{17171}{17238}And it will be a long wait.
{17255}{17342}Pour Khiss! At least approximately, how long?
{17406}{17560}Twenty, twenty five years...
{17687}{17807}Not too long!|When we return,|I will be only 50 years old!
{17862}{17920}And I only 75!
{17957}{18050}Crew, take you places!|We pass to the orbital flight.
{18480}{18516}Niza!
{18569}{18621}You are in space for the first time.
{18655}{18781}- 20 years, is this terrible for you?|- But what about You?
{18851}{19000}- I was born in space, on board of a spaceship.|- I didn't know.
{19002}{19167}And my first children's impressions were|- blackness of space,
{19170}{19245}the myriads of stars and the panels of starship.
{19291}{19382}But you changed the subject, you didn't answer me.
{19438}{19541}20 years, this is clearly terrible.
{19648}{19742}- But I am glad!|- How so?
{19833}{20064}In any case, these 20 yers|next to you will be me. But not her.
{20129}{20211}Good day! Am I too late?
{20381}{20463}- Veda Kong.|- I have heard a lot about you!
{20469}{20496}And I about you.
{20515}{20588}After we receive information|from epsilon of Toucan
{20595}{20762}she will read a lecture about our history|for the planet of the system of star Canopus.
{20765}{20814}It's time!
{21003}{21086}- System check ready!|- Confirmed.
{21097}{21154}- Countdown ready!|- Confirmed.
{21179}{21275}- Ignition engaged!|- Confirmed.
{21485}{21614}Satellite 57 greets you, earthlings!
{21622}{21679}The Earth greets you, satellite!
{21711}{21878}Kour Ghan, this is Mven Mas,|look to him with attention!
{21893}{22015}- From now you will work with him.|- Here everything is ready, waiting for epsilon of Toucan.
{22027}{22126}They apparently are attempting|to make the contact with any civilization.
{22131}{22193}Well, Kour Ghan, take command!
{22217}{22251}Attention!
{22306}{22437}It's time, Mven, to take the forces|of the planet into your hands!
{22560}{22611}Forward, to the challenge!
{22640}{22705}Forward, to the challenge!
{22950}{23055}Mountains! Just like the Pamir.|The height not more than 2000-3000 meters.
{23070}{23130}I can only imagine, what color is water!
{23144}{23193}- Outlines...|- Then what is this?
{23195}{23237}Large meteorite.
{23240}{23300}-Or...|- Ship!
{23305}{23409}- Spaceship! Rocket!|- Rocket?
{23420}{23574}Fantasy! Here, far off the standard routes,|in the edge of the galaxy?
{24410}{24562}I don't think they have there planets|with the highest forms of life.
{24585}{24643}They are lonely.
{24709}{24887}Yes, they are lonely, as we were lonely, we earthlings.
{24916}{25049}Until we deccoded the language of the Great Ring|and entered the brotherhood of reason.
{25063}{25143}Do they really know nothing|about the Great Ring?
{25467}{25523}Probably, by now, they already know.
{25544}{25630}What we see now, occurred 300 years ago.
{25650}{25700}300 years!
{25737}{25798}88 parsecs from here!
{25838}{25929}All, who we see now, are already dead long ago.
{26622}{26757}88 parsecs! 88...
{26779}{26886}That's all. His position is unstable,
{26890}{26962}but it is fixed and now signal is gathered.
{26975}{27049}Make sure that today|entire planet knows about this.
{27053}{27130}And prepare information for the members of the Ring!
{27226}{27360}- I am disconnecting, Veter!|- Ask him, he is the chief now.
{27680}{27782}How long will the lecture go to Canopus?
{27824}{27899}100 - 120 years.
{27923}{27995}And they will see me living!
{28060}{28240}What a monstrous contradiction|between the might of man, his reason,
{28252}{28343}and his unimpotance in time and the space.
{28374}{28567}And mankind is so far unable|to overcome and to compress time.
{28611}{28721}You have 10 minutes more.|Will you remain here or you come with me?
{28739}{28792}I'll stay here.
{28845}{29035}She is excellent. And amazingly human-like.
{29100}{29220}Yes. She is amazing.
{29245}{29362}For the first time in 800 years|of existence of Great Ring
{29368}{29547}we not only saw a planet with intelligent life,|but also with human-like appearance.
{29568}{29695}So, I have reasons, why I do not love space|with its emptiness and monstrous distances.
{29716}{29816}They are now there, and if something happens,
{29822}{29931}either I or entire humanity|have any powers to help.
{30063}{30157}- Excuse me, Commander.|- Something happened?
{30167}{30211}The second orbit begins.
{30279}{30316}Yes, I know.
{30453}{30519}She is beautiful.
{30704}{30750}Beautiful.
{30765}{30827}But she does not love you.
{30834}{30930}I saw, how she accompanied you.
{30951}{31060}As a friend, as a person, one who risks all,
{31082}{31142}but not as a loved one.
{31260}{31371}This portrait, it supports you in hard times,
{31384}{31490}it strengthens faith, gives power,
{31493}{31582}but it does not call back to the Earth. Right?
{31638}{31701}Central station speaking.
{31707}{31830}Commander, this is the spaceship!|We had time to take a picture.
{31839}{31934}Alien! You do understand? Alien!
{31978}{32064}What happened, Mven? Why this urgency?
{32135}{32194}Did you hear about my new work?
{32200}{32313}Not only heard, but also saw in the last news|the formal announcement.
{32318}{32412}Ren, here is why I called you here.
{32480}{32520}See!
{32580}{32620}See!
{32630}{32770}There is the star epsilon of Toucan,|and there the star 61 Cygnus,
{32773}{32867}and further is Albireo. Three stars!
{32871}{32944}And there, and there, and there is life!
{32947}{32998}I know, Ren, I saw!
{33001}{33085}There pulses thought,|intelligent life lives there.
{33127}{33262}But they are monstrously far apart.
{33326}{33455}Ren, I know, in you academy you deal with space.
{33458}{33546}Yes, with space as a function of the time.
{33630}{33700}Let's join our projects together, Ren.
{33735}{33860}I want to compress time.
{33885}{34017}And then to see livingbeings|and to speak with living beings.
{34068}{34181}You are theorist, Ren, tell me, is this possible?
{34224}{34325}It seems, that I am close to the solution.
{34333}{34448}But my conclusions need verification.|And verification needs to be experimental.
{34473}{34529}I am glad that you understood me.
{34563}{34673}You and I are just grit in this boundless space.
{34679}{34785}But today, right now, we create a challenge!
{34912}{34973}The spaceship does not respond to our signals.
{35003}{35046}Sixteenth orbit.
{35065}{35128}The noise of planetary engines|one cannot fail to hear!
{35134}{35222}Disc spaceships are unknown in nearby regions!
{35229}{35308}I am convinced - this is an alien in trouble!
{35310}{35359}What does crew recommend?
{35386}{35428}We are in trouble too!
{35460}{35521}But they clearly need our help!
{35524}{35578}As if we do not need help!
{35678}{35752}Eighteenth orbit. They do not hear us!
{35756}{35806}Or do not undersand.
{35839}{35883}We have to land, Commander!
{35891}{36010}- That's last of our fuel!|- Yes, the last!
{36055}{36112}We will no longer be able to take off.
{36127}{36193}And we will not be able to send a signal flare?
{36351}{36466}Yes, we will not be able to send rocket!
{36679}{36758}We are just considering! We are in uncertain!
{36766}{36850}There, below, are the messengers from another world!
{36936}{36975}Crew, remain at your places!
{36993}{37061}We go to the lower layers|of the atmosphere for landing!
{37069}{37119}Switch on the warning signals!
{37219}{37294}Crew Personnel Station: Good morning!
{37302}{37329}Good morning!
{37342}{37458}The place in the underwater titanium mines|on the coast of South America is free.
{37472}{37520}But it is necessary to go quickly!
{37535}{37640}Excuse me, I forgot to inform you,|I already selected a place.
{37674}{37715}I am just gathering the my stuff.
{37832}{37895}I am going to the archaelogical expedition.
{37900}{37996}No problem! I just wanted to carry out|your request more precisely.
{38000}{38077}We will find enough people to this place.
{38195}{38272}Living Quarters Assignment Station:|good morning! - Good morning!
{38278}{38429}I am leaving. Sector 6, 385 691.
{38432}{38468}Accepted.
{38936}{39062}Finally! I started thinking, that I arrived too early.
{39245}{39312}Well, Veter, everything is already done.
{39382}{39515}- Now you are my subordinated.|- I obey, my chief!
{40483}{40564}They are dead. And long ago.
{40686}{40760}Another victim of space.
{40773}{40948}I understand, catastrophes are inevitable,|but to see it...
{40966}{41049}Eon, the surface vehicle is ready.|Surface vehicle is ready.
{41061}{41120}Excellent, Kay, let's go.
{41124}{41257}Emergency group to the vehicle!|Ranking officer aboard the ship is Kay Bear.
{41361}{41454}- Pel! What about your planet?|- Why is it "my" planet?
{41460}{41558}But whose is it? Who discovered the iron star?
{41562}{41655}A planet is like a planet. It is possible to live!
{41758}{41817}They could also not take off!
{41828}{41939}Just like us! They broke free from the grips|of the iron star's gravity.
{41949}{42129}It's a trap-planet. They warn on the Great Ring| about them. The legends are based on them.
{42141}{42207}How many millenia was it on the way?
{42234}{42380}Why? What is missing there, in his home?
{42387}{42528}The same what us, Kim, knowledge, brotherhood.
{42538}{42647}- Commander, I will go around it to the left.|- And I to the right.
{42879}{43020}May be we are too careless, Erg?|Strange planet, strange life.
{43023}{43058}A-a-a...
{43185}{43308}Eon, Niza, stop! Stop!
{43315}{43369}Back! Pel, here!
{43392}{43455}Back! Hold them in light!
{43456}{43492}Back!
{43504}{43593}Eon, Niza! Do not stray from the light!
{43598}{43683}All move away behind the vehicle!|Hold the light!
{44112}{44200}- What happened to Kim?|- Why are you silent? What about Kim?
{44212}{44270}Erg, answer!
{44377}{44482}I have heard these markings on many planets.
{44500}{44704}The best children of the Earth remained|here to warn those who follow.
{44728}{44800}Our boy! Erg, you do not know.
{44817}{44943}He emulated you in everything,|he trained his will excessively.
{44954}{45021}Only I answer for all that happened!
{45034}{45105}But there is no sense to speak of it,|only on the Earth.
{45112}{45200}On The Earth? Commander still|does believe in this possibility?
{45224}{45331}I believe thus far I live.|We will send signal flare.
{45333}{45370}But fuel?
{45380}{45437}Let's attempt to explore this strange spaceship.
{45442}{45514}It is possible that there is some form of energy.
{45519}{45676}You forget, Commander, out of the ship|we are powerless an unarmed.
{45681}{45784}Light! Commander was first who notice this!
{45788}{45917}The killer is the creature of gloom,|and he must fear light!
{46706}{46738}Back!
{46879}{46939}All move away behind vehicle!
{47176}{47232}Lower you helmet visors!
{47304}{47342}Be careful!
{47463}{47511}Shield your eyes!
{47608}{47659}Shield your eyes! 
{47845}{47944}Send next, Kei!|We will change only settings.
{47975}{48033}Erg, may be enough? Calm down!
{48040}{48161}We must break in!|Don't waste time, Kei!
{48177}{48288}Commander! He do not let us in!|We have to leave.
{48292}{48411}Foolishness! We just break in blindly.
{48420}{48605}But forsaking of attempts is forsaking|of life, rocket, and finally of escape. 
{48612}{48747}- May be we'll continue tomorrow?|- Or may be after month or half a year?
{48762}{48820}We have enough time.
{48834}{48897}We really have enough time.
{48927}{49062}But irritation and impatience|are bad advisers, Commander.
{49090}{49196}Pur Hiss, you said it?
{49330}{49434}Agree. Let's continue tomorrow.
{49850}{49970}This way we do not achieve success.|Attempt after attempt, but result is zero.
{49981}{50114}- We just do not have robots.|- But there must be some key!
{50120}{50213}- It is inside the spaceship.|- Take your time, Erg!
{50220}{50286}What did we, when we landed here?
{50324}{50447}Right! We have to look for|tracks of this spaceship owners!
{51026}{51058}What's there?
{51066}{51150}- Metallic object.|- 20 degrees to the left.
{51158}{51196}Kay, we go forward.
{51202}{51290}- But you will leave the light of "Tantra"!|- We will go!
{51735}{51862}- Surface vehicle from the terrestrial spaceship!|- What vehicle? What spaceship?
{51870}{51998}I cannot follow you by light!|Erg, where are you?
{52048}{52095}We'll go ahead!
{52450}{52578}"Tantra"! We found a surface vehicle.|There are no people.
{52583}{52720}Kay, we go forward. Raise searchlights.|Try to accompany us.
{52964}{53084}In the last ten years not a single|first class spaceship has left the Earth.
{53088}{53266}Yes, but 15 years ago started 36th Star Expedition.
{53269}{53362}- And one ship did not return.|- Do you think, this is the "Sail"?
{53869}{54081}It is the "Sail"! Earth spaceship|of the first class. The twin of our "Tantra".
{54815}{54868}Do you no longer like our work?
{54893}{55017}I am complacent, I am calm,|as if they treat me by blue sky dreams.
{55022}{55145}Yes, of course. After so many years|of life in space...
{55171}{55271}our work seems small and dull.
{55279}{55455}In my opinion, in the past centuries|they already explored everywhere, the entire planet.
{55459}{55611}It was always so. Some look to the future,|others investigate in the past.
{55640}{55713}The same will be after we gone, Veter.
{55845}{55907}I just talked with Mven Mas.
{55933}{56045}The set time passed, but "Tantra" is still silent.
{56084}{56146}Something happened, Veter!
{56301}{56368}We know so little about space.
{56387}{56483}Actually, we are trampling down|on our small scrap of space.
{56725}{56883}Kay, Lin! Pay close attention!|Always keep us in the light!
{57173}{57248}Somewhere there must be|an emergency light terminal.
{57255}{57305}That would be nice.
{57526}{57637}Great! It works!
{57698}{57738}Enter!
{58232}{58278}The fourth.
{58841}{58953}- Ingrid, Kay, do you copy us?|- Yes, we do, Commander.
{58957}{59028}- All is OK, Erg!|- We are going inside!
{59039}{59171}Eon will inspect forward holds,|Niza and me the central station.
{59198}{59287}Pel and Lin inspect the rear decks.
{59341}{59428}Pel, anameson is most important!
{61073}{61160}Niza, look for flight logs first!
{61428}{61515}Commander! Erg! Do you copy me?
{61538}{61579}Yes, very well, Eon!
{61580}{61659}That means, that onboard radio equipment is working!
{61733}{61811}Attention! Central station speaking!
{61827}{61899}- Pel, do you copy?|- I do, Commander.
{62216}{62291}Dust. Soot.
{62355}{62462}Nothing suspicious. Nothing supernatural.
{62473}{62612}Only two marks of unknown origin,|on the floor and on the wall.
{62618}{62726}Here the same. In the corridor there is|a strange spot near the chamber 016.
{62730}{62791}Just on the door, the size of a human torso.
{62819}{62920}- Did you enter the chamber?|- Yes, I did.
{62998}{63040}Why do you keep silent?
{63043}{63170}Perhaps I did not say?|There is anameson. Four containers.
{63192}{63239}Four!
{63266}{63387}"Tantra"! Friends! Do you hear?
{63415}{63513}My dears, we are saved!
{63520}{63604}May be someone will finally|turn off this damned noise?
{63774}{63868}Commander! The flight logs!
{64140}{64263}Today, 12th of 7th month of 323th year of Ring,
{64272}{64392}we all, who were survived, finished|preparation ofa rocket-transmitter.
{64399}{64469}Tomorrow we will send that calculated...
{64559}{64600}...I switch on more...
{64635}{64666}...more...
{64751}{64800}Something happened!
{64806}{64876}What happened? That, that they collected...
{64944}{65030}Two were rescued.|Blanca did not jump so far... elevator...
{65034}{65088}We could not close the doors, only second one.
{65091}{65182}Mechanics reached the engines. He struck by planetary...
{65185}{65298}They, besides fury and horror, nothing. Yes, nothing...
{65328}{65414}Seems that Kton also did not reach. I am alone.
{65418}{65506}I am alone. But I survived!
{65511}{65655}Before I begin... Brothers, if you find "Sail",
{65661}{65761}I warn, never leave your ship.
{65779}{65874}I have to investigate about Kton.|I will explain in detail when I return.
{65876}{65948}Where is the music? Where is the song?
{66663}{66846}According to tradition of our astronauts,|let's honor our dead comrades.
{67098}{67201}Dear friends! Thanks to you!
{67228}{67388}We promise to return,|and report your discovery to humanity,
{67397}{67493}convey your love to the Earth.
{68225}{68327}I do not understand your indecision,Erg.|It's like you are waiting for something.
{68349}{68474}We finish loading anameson in 12 hours,|and then we will be able to take off.
{68499}{68627}Yes, Kay, as a commander, I am ready|to give the command. But as a scientist...
{68646}{68800}We met here something unknown,|and this unknown kills.
{68825}{68996}We are scouts, Kay. After us others will arrive.|Tragedy of "Sail" can not be repeated.
{69036}{69088}Does it mean, that launch is postponed?
{69127}{69258}Yes. We must meet those unknown face to face.
{69275}{69447}Eon is preparing one experiment.|I have to feel and to see this myself.
{69530}{69663}"Tantra", kill the searchlight! Eon, lights off!
{69735}{69825}Well, well, now we need patience.
{70274}{70412}Look, Niza, this time you were able to convince Eon,
{70420}{70539}but from tomorrow I forbid you|participation in all actions outside the ship.
{70558}{70678}But Commander, according to the schedule|I am in the emergency group.
{70683}{70733}I am not joking!
{70926}{70978}Are you afraid, that I am close to you?
{71092}{71138}But nevertheless I will be close.
{71173}{71349}Close to you - here, now, then...
{71363}{71554}on this planet, on the Earth... Entire life.
{71635}{71814}I love you, Commander.|And I can't go anywhere from this love.
{71927}{71966}Niza!
{71970}{72118}Wel, well. I will be silent.
{72150}{72321}Just accept it. These are the verses|of very ancient poet.
{72371}{72416}Accept it for the memory!
{72424}{72537}A printed book? What old times!
{72555}{72724}Now! Do you sense it?|A pain in your spine?
{72726}{72761}I sense it too.
{72985}{73128}Attention! "Tantra"! Kay, are you ready?
{73173}{73261}Attention! Light!
{73309}{73366}Well, what was this?
{73380}{73434}- I had't time to observe.|- Me either.
{73438}{73476}Something like feelers.
{73478}{73577}May be these are shadows, the clusters of darkness|around the discharges of some energy?
{73578}{73674}No, no, it is clearly living creature.|And it tried to devour us.
{73675}{73783}The monster has striking reaction. No wonder|those who were killed had no time to report.
{73785}{73863}Recreating of this is unpleasant,|but we need to repeat our experiment.
{73868}{73921}Kay, turn the light off!
{74053}{74100}The creature is not alone!
{74143}{74220}I think, one ought not let him to touch the car.
{74234}{74268}You are right.
{74300}{74365}"Tantra", get ready!
{74398}{74457}Let's each looks only to his side!
{74525}{74548}Kay!
{74718}{74806}I Have never seen something like this!|I'll never forget it until the day I die!
{74824}{74932}Erg! We have to seriously study these jellyfishes!
{75085}{75231}Jellyfishes and spiral-disc!|Are we scientists or not?
{75253}{75376}We can't miss this opportunity to learn,|from where it is,
{75386}{75521}who constructed them, what they carried to other places?
{75590}{75647}That's why I propose planetary engines.
{75652}{75751}Use of a planetary engine, is, of course, a good idea.
{75753}{75791}But how...
{76051}{76133}It is decided. Only men will go.
{76176}{76230}As in the good old times.
{76289}{76348}- But Louma?|- Louma is a doctor.
{76366}{76410}I am a doctor too!
{76434}{76543}You are, first of all, astro-navigator, Niza,|and you must be at your place.
{76565}{76708}Well! Well, I will be at my place.
{76936}{76965}Louma!
{77043}{77132}I must be tomorrow with him and the next!
{77189}{77265}Ridiculous! There will all be next to him there.
{77359}{77487}Is it really so hard to understand? You all!
{77510}{77634}But it must be, first of all, me! Me!
{77768}{77836}No one can be too close, no one!
{77857}{77896}Niza?
{77932}{78022}Louma does not feel well,|she requested replacement.
{78061}{78126}When they request, it cannot be refused.
{78138}{78193}We will clear it up aboard the ship.
{78258}{78308}By the way, Kay...
{78708}{78755}Commander, where are you going?
{79030}{79065}Erg!
{79259}{79369}Erg! Erg! Erg!
{80558}{80678}Retreat! Everyone! Everyone stay back!
{80728}{80796}"Tanta", hold the light!
{81076}{81164}Retreat! It is enough victims!
{81168}{81268}We are not ready for this fight. Retreat!
{81745}{81826}- She is alive, but...|- Is she dying?
{81832}{81945}Not yet. The heart works, one beat in one hundred seconds.
{81968}{82070}This is not death,|but still a complete collapse.
{82130}{82183}Consciousness, pain?
{82214}{82245}Excluded.
{82249}{82381}Absolutely. If collapse will not progress, it's all the same.
{82389}{82443}Let she will sleep until the Earth.
{82461}{82593}I fear hovewer, if her heart will|overload on takeoff.
{82598}{82633}What do you propose?
{82678}{82847}We'll prepare a special chamber.|And then insert her in a floating medical box.
{82853}{82954}Agreed. As soon as you're done,|report back to the post.
{82974}{83044}We will stay here no longer than necessary.
{83118}{83200}Taht's enough of the darkness|and gravity of this black world.
{83709}{83929}"For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings|That then I scorn to change my state with kings'."
{84068}{84176}Everything is ready, Commander. We can start.
{84470}{84529}Just a moment, Kay.
{84552}{84784}There are Louma, Eon... They must do something.
{84932}{84987}What an ancient melody!
{85018}{85089}This is the melody of my distant ancestors.
{85094}{85139}They lived here.
{85170}{85332}They lived, they grazed cattle, they ploughed, loved...
{85428}{85613}Veter, I do not ask, I am somehow sure.
{85649}{85866}You will not leave expedition, you will not leave me.
{85894}{86098}We will move to the sea soon, and you are|certainly free to select any work, but...
{86123}{86211}my friends like you.
{86325}{86358}Veda!
{86398}{86522}We are not children. When can we speak seriously?
{86558}{86670}Only when "Tantra" comes back.
{87402}{87462}So I did not answer you.
{87495}{87575}I thought, we will have time there on the Earth.
{87664}{87716}Do you see...
{87788}{87859}you do hear anything in your sleep?
{87907}{87960}Do you remember me?
{87974}{88052}Erg! She does not hear!
{88067}{88125}She cannot hear anything!
{88135}{88234}You told me, I am afraid to be close.
{88255}{88351}Now I am next to you, and I do not fear.
{88365}{88478}You have to rest. Pull yourself together, Commander!
{88634}{88755}Erg! How long are we been with|already in space?
{88765}{88868}We saw much, even death, severe and absurd.
{88874}{89026}You can't, you do not have a right to weaken yourself!
{89284}{89374}- Erg!|- What else?
{89396}{89557}I must say that modern neurology|has mapped the emergence of emotions.
{89600}{89721}I want to say that medicine can manage their existence
{89727}{89845}to act on those cerebral core,|to suppress distressful experiences.
{89847}{89898}And I could...
{89996}{90059}Do you propose...
{90128}{90343}to supress my love in orded|to free me from the suffering?
{90348}{90404}Man must not suffer, Erg!
{90406}{90517}Suffering deprives you of reason!|But the crew needs you reason!
{90520}{90566}She is right, Erg!
{91078}{91148}She is right, Erg, right!
{91348}{91388}Yes, I agree.
{91748}{91802}Am I late?
{91806}{91874}No, no. Please.
{93357}{93417}What's wrong, Erg? Be careful!
{93613}{93680}Commander! Erg!
{93805}{93867}Erg, what's wrong?
{94157}{94199}Erg, do you feel okay?
{94538}{94580}Here!
{94606}{94647}Here!
{94696}{94782}"That then I scorn to change my state with kings'."
{94782}{94813}Erg!
{94863}{94919}You did not understand at all!
{95021}{95115}No, Louma, no!
{95176}{95312}I will not give up my feelings,|even if they force me to suffer.
{95463}{95697}Suffering, if it not too intense,|conducts to the understanding, understanding to the love.
{95705}{95769}So it is a locked circle.
{95796}{95891}Wou were good to me, thanks.
{95903}{95980}But there will be no second session, Louma!
{96330}{96431}You, the elders, who call me to the way of labor!
{96434}{96546}Aaccept my skill and desire, accept my labor,
{96550}{96628}and teach me in daylight and at night!
{96632}{96718}Lend me a guiding hand,|since the way is difficult!
{96721}{96762}And I will follow you!
{96766}{96827}You are changed, Veter!
{96847}{96977}Earlier, when you commanded entire energy|of Earth, spoke with the distant worlds...
{96983}{97038}Was I so different?
{97047}{97147}You started to smile more, to be glad|about the simplest, the most usual things.
{97149}{97208}You are greatly changed, Veter!
{97235}{97274}Mven Mas?
{97312}{97352}Is he looking for you?
{97356}{97465}Yes, we arranged a meeting here.|He flew in from Tibet.
{97469}{97551}With Ren Boze they are preparing|an immense experiment.
{97554}{97634}Ah, this is surely connected with|his dream about compressing time?
{97637}{97746}Obviously. And he needs me|right here, at the ceremony.
{97750}{97799}That is Mven Mas.
{97801}{97851}- Excuse me.|- Of course.
{98127}{98186}Everything has been provided by you.
{98291}{98410}Now the most serious matter remains,|the danger of work.
{98521}{98611}What scientist is afraid of risk?
{98651}{98711}I did not talk about the personal, Mven.
{98777}{98890}But experiment will include|the external stations of Great Ring.
{98946}{99101}Do we have the right to risk the greatest|achievement of humanity, a window to the cosmos?
{99142}{99272}I see billions of past human lives!
{99292}{99497}Where instantly, as sand between the fingers,|ran away theyr youth, beauty and happiness of life.
{99576}{99711}They are asking to answer the great riddle|of time and entering into battle with it!
{99723}{99870}If you are so convinced, you should|address Council of Astro Navigation!
{99971}{100043}I am speeking to its chairman!
{100093}{100163}But I did not give consent yet, Mven!
{100371}{100459}Is time for you to return to the big matters, Dar Veter!
{100469}{100544}The Council does not consider another candidate.
{100549}{100603}You will give agreement, Veter!
{100708}{100909}Listen the report of the Council|of Astro Navigation! They return!
{100968}{101103}They return! Veter, did you hear?
{101121}{101158}Did you already hear? They return!
{101168}{101315}I am happy for you! Very.
{101362}{101478}The ship is in one hundredth|of parsec from the orbit of Neptune.
{101484}{101588}In a week "Tantra" will be welcomed|home on Neptune's hospitable moon, Triton
{101594}{101748}and after a five-week quarantine,|the Earth will joyfully greet "Tantra"!

I'm sorry, Donna...
I shouldn't have said that.
We can release no statement at this time.
Oxygen countdown.
Mr. Curan would like a countdown on the oxygen...
Every 15 seconds.
2 minutes, 30 seconds.
No contact for 9 full hours.
Same thing all over again!
Same thing all over again.
Yet the whole rig is clicking like a dream.
2 minutes, 15 seconds.
We licked every problem...
Put a man on the Moon.
No, we got him off.
Everything worked fine, but Lockhart.
What happened to him?
2 minutes, 0 seconds.
Mr. Curan's desk.
Yes sir, one moment.
The White House.
No, not now.
No.
- 1 minute, 45 seconds.
- Mr. Curan feels certain that there's...
No hope for capt. Lockhart.
Yes sir.
1 minute, 30 seconds.
You alright?
- 1 minute, 15 seconds.
- How's our boss holding up?
Barrenger?
Well, as usual he's not said a word.
I wouldn't get too close to him, if I were you.
I was figuring on giving him a sedative.
60 seconds.
Ready?
Who isn't?
- It isn't over yet.
- Will be in about 60 seconds.
Well...
We've done it your way, twice.
Well, now, we don't pretend to know all the answers.
Apparently, no one does.
For every frontier that's been explored...
- Men have died.
- 45 seconds.
We've only lost 2 men on the strangest frontier of all.
There are millions of people in this world, Dr. Weitzberg.
But there are only 4 men left who can handle the lunar rocket.
We've lost 1/3 of the men we had.
It's like a conveyor tube to oblivion.
- Mr. Barrenger...
- 30 seconds.
The situation that happened to those first 2 men...
Was not only duplicated but widely exaggerated in their training.
Those men did not have a mental crackup.
I'd stake my life on it.
There is no duplicate for the solitude of space!
If those men could've looked in their viewing screen...
And seen 2, 3 or more sister ships alongside...
- 15 seconds.
- Out there... they wouldn't have panicked!
You heard those tapes.
Those men did not panic!
- The next time, we do it my way.
- 10, 9...
- 8, 7, 6...
- The remaining 4 men in mass flight.
- 5, 4...
- Well, then, do it without me.
- 3, 2...
- The mass flight takes place next month.
- We'll talk about it!
- 1, 0.
Oxygen, depleted.
Damn!
I'll see you in Washington... tomorrow.
Steve...
Think he knew about
Don and Mel Lockhart?
I don't know, doc.
If he did, I doubt if it'd make much difference.
Steve, might as well write off 4 more men.
I can't take much more of this, doc.
I wonder how he can justify it?
Our boss is the secretary of Space Operations.
And that cabinet post...
Entitles him to be a very daring man.
Well, we gotta stop him, doc.
Alright, Steve, before you go see him tomorrow, stop by my office.
I don't get it.
I just don't get it!
The pattern is the same as before.
Perfect take-off.
Clear contact all the way.
Perfect landing.
You heard Lockhart when he was on the lunar surface.
Lift-off from the Moon, perfect!
1 hour later, nothing!
And we had him right here, doc!
If he wanted to talk to us he didn't even have to push a lousy button!
Do you read me?
Do you read me?!
Lockhart...
X-20 approaching ionosphere.
Someone, please, come in!
My god, my god!
X-20 to Moon blat.
Do you read me?!
Lockhart?
This is Moon blat.
Curan, Steve Curan.
Come in, X-20.
Steve...
It's coming on again.
My god...
My god!
Kill.
Kill!
Doc... what's wrong with that man?
I don't know, Steve.
This is doc Weitzberg.
How long have you been without oxygen?
15, maybe... 20 minutes.
It's impossible!
Why did you break contact?
Wouldn't let make contact. Please...
Kill...
No, no! Oh, don't...
- Steve...
- I... I can't make it...
Lost control.
Push red...
Push the red...
I can't push that red button, that'll blow him up.
Way off course.
Can't make it.
No, no!
Something... makes my arm move.
Makes me... do things.
Kill, kill!
Doctor, we've got to help him.
I'm 200.000 feet!
Push the red...
Something in me...
Push the red...
Why do you want us to push it?
You can push it, if you want to.
Won't let me.
I can't move my arm!
Kill!
Kill!
165.000.
Push the red...
No more time!
What's his position, where is he?
Inland.
Populated area...
California.
140.000.
Push the red!
Kill!
My god!
My god, Steve, help me!
Help me!
Push the red...
Push it...!
My... my god!
God, Steve, help me!
Help me!
Push the red...
70.000!
Push it!
Well, that's one tape we don't want Donna to transcribe.
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.
How can a man continue to function without oxygen for 20 minutes?
Can't.
Lockhart did.
So, we know...
Something kept him functioning.
A substitute for oxygen?
I don't know, Steve. But ever since we lost Nelson...
An idea's been buzzing around in my brain, like a fly.
A very persistent fly.
After hearing Lockhart the buzzing stopped.
Ya know, I think
I've hit on something.
Wanna hear it out with me?
Go ahead, have at it.
Well, I think what kept
Lockhart going, was life.
An independent vital force...
Something... living.
Well, that's pretty wild, doc.
Well, "living" covers a lot of territory, Steve.
And I don't think
Lockhart was alone...
On his return flight any more than Nelson was.
Oh, now, doc...
I'm not talking about little, green men.
As a matter of fact, I may not talk at all unless I get some encouragement.
Well, what do you need, uh, a drink, maybe?
No... time.
And you're the one that can get
Barrenger to give it to me.
Time? For what?
Time, to prove that this force, this...
"new life" was born on the X-20.
Go ahead.
I need you with me all the way, Steve.
Alright, I'm with you.
What makes life?
A certain, particular combination of molecules...
Or carbon, or silicone, or nitrogen.
Or any number of these things.
A certain temperature.
Mix well, call it what you will, but this mass...
Swirling together in tiny orbits, fuses these things into a...
Precise energy relationship which we call "life."
Ah, now, wait a minute.
What you're saying is that, uh... in space...
Life might mutate, or...
Even fully evolve in a matter of hours, or... even minutes.
What happens when we send a man up there?
You see, see... we don't just send a man in a rocket.
We send up living cells, molecules, bacteria, germs.
We throw in radioactivity.
We introduce all these to cosmic rays.
Do we upset this balance?
Do we start a cycle?
Does a living cell from Earth romance a cosmic ray...
And give birth to an illegitimate monster who makes his nest in...
In Lockhart and Nelson?
It's beginning to add up, isn't it?
Perhaps it was weakening, maybe dying...
Anything evolving so rapidly couldn't live very long.
Well, Steve?
Quite a chunk.
Ah, throw out the logic pills when you swallow it!
This theory can't be measured by anything we already know.
- Sounds like a good case.
- I was hoping you'd say that.
Barrenger won't. He won't go for a theory even if it's true.
Then lie to him!
But buy me the time.
No dancing. No dancing!
Not allowed.
No dancing! No dancing, not allowed.
No rats, not allowed.
Marta, how can you stand those things?
And you are gonna be a nurse, Patsy?!
Well, what are you doing with them?
I picked them up at the
Express Office for grandpa.
They're for the lab at school.
Well, maybe your grandfather's a biology professor...
And your boyfriend's a pre-med student...
But my father's the sheriff and rats and the law don't mix.
Voilà!
No rats.
Hey, you didn't bite!
When I said "boyfriend."
You mean, Paul?
Then he isn't just a mutual interest in hives and chicken pox!
He's very nice.
But how did you hook him?
I know a dozen girls who tried.
The "lone wolf," they call him.
Well, I'm not saying you're not stacked, but he's just not with it.
We're just good friends.
Eat, drink and be merry... for tomorrow you die.
You think I'm kiddin', huh?
Didn't you see that thing last night?
No!
I didn't see anything.
Well, I phoned your father.
Why, there was a fireball in the sky as big as a house.
He didn't see it either.
Well... what do you think it was?
Didn't I tell ya?
Eat, drink and be merry...
Tomorrow you die.
And now, for your local news here at Palms, California.
The traffic commission has decided...
Hi!
- Hi Paul.
- Hi Paul.
Come on, sit down beside me.
Come on, finish your milk, let's get going.
Can we stop by my house?
What for?
It's getting late.
I gotta pick up my bathing suit.
But I told you I'd meet you here, you said you'd have your suit with you!
I forgot it.
I just can't get used to going swimming at Christmas time.
Well, I can tell you one thing...
What's that?
It's for real... you sound like a married couple already.
Come on, finish your milk, let's go.
Alright!
Ok?
I gotta take... drop things at home for grandpa, anyhow.
Ok, let's get a m-move on.
- Bye, Patsy.
- Bye Patsy.
Goodbye, you two lovebirds.
Hey, Paul...
What are they sayin' over at the school about that thing in the sky last night?
Nothin', why? Everybody said it was a meteor.
Hey, come on! Don't tell me you're still scared of them flyin' saucers?
Eat, drink and be merry.
Hi, children.
Hi.
Picked it up for you at the Express Office.
- Thank you, thank you, dear.
- I love you, grandpa. Gotta run!
Hello there, mr. Farnstrom.
I never will understand how you do it.
What's that, sir?
It's 15 minutes past the last bell...
And already, you're off somewhere with my granddaughter.
Well, we have a system, sir.
A secret system.
Secret...
Paul... you keep things too much to yourself.
In science, you must learn that you have to share.
To work together, to accept help.
Not me, professor.
When I make it,
I'll make it on my own.
All the way.
What did I tell you?
Breaking the speed laws!
Going swimming! I'll be back in time to make dinner.
Swimming? Where ??? swimming?
That's our secret, sir.
Our secret place.
You can't object to go swimming, grandpa!
That's ???
You look at me like this,
I can't object to anything this safe.
Bye.
- Bye, bye.
- Love you.
Got your suit?
- Bye!
- Bye.
Bye...
I wonder if they will come to good to science as much as you will.
Are you hurt?
Only my pride!
Poor boy!
The sensitive male ego... so easily wounded.
I think I know now the secret of how to be successful with a woman.
You do? Tell me!
You have to be weak, pathetic.
Then they feel sorry for you.
I think you discovered it.
I know I have.
I always wondered why some spindly, little runts had the girls chasin' after 'em.
Because they felt sorry for 'em.
Of course.
But you were fooling me!
You're not weak.
Darn right.
Now I've got you.
Paul...
I guess I'm not like those other women.
I don't like weak men at all.
Listen... will you once and for all give me a serious answer?
What about?
Are you going home, to Sweden... after the semester's over?
Why not? I only planned to come to California for a year.
To see grandfather... to go to an American school for a while...
Nothing has come up to change my plans.
Whaddya mean?
What about me?
No... I planned there would be a boy, too!
Why you little...!
Don't come any closer!
I've nothing on.
Faker! You haven't had time to undress.
Maybe I didn't...
But I have now!
Ok!
You win.
You know...
I don't think your grandfather approves of me.
You're wrong!
He considers you the best student in his class.
I meant as a member of the family.
What do I have to do, say it in Swedish?
Paul?
What does it mean
I'm "stacked"?
And you're "not with it"?
Stacked?
Where'd you hear that?
Patsy.
This afternoon.
She must've seen you in that suit!
Is something wrong?
Yeah... I'm having non-clinical thoughts.
??? me or not?
How do you say it in Swedish?
Say what?!
Nothin'... let's hit the water.
You know something?
American men marry much too young.
You know something?
It's because of
Swedish girls like you.
But Donna, I've called everywhere and haven't been able to find him!
Didn't he say where he was going?
No... he was quite upset when he left.
He banged on the typewriter for a while... he was in a mood.
I've gotta talk to him right away, it's urgent!
When he acts like this, he wants to be alone.
Well, this is the one time he shouldn't be alone.
Doc, you've got me worried.
I didn't mean to scare you, this is a matter of the gravest importance.
I'll try.
I'll be here until I hear from you.
And Donna... everything alright?
- Yes, doc.
- Good.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
Boy, that water was cold!
Alright... now!
Now what?
The answer.
- Answer?
- That's right.
What answer?
You gonna stay here?
Well, why should I do that?
So I can marry you, stupid!
Marry me? Oh, good!
Paul, Paul!
Take me away, please!
Sure, baby, sure.
Marta...
Let me go back for it, I'll lock it in the trunk of the car.
No, no,
I couldn't stand it!
Let's go right to the sheriff, this is a murder!
- No, not a murder...
- A human hand, not a murder?!
Listen, please... you've just got to trust me.
If it's what I think it is, it could be very important for me, please!
No, no, just take me away from here!
Put your hands up or I'll shoot!
Mrs. Hotchkiss, it's only me...
Paul, what are you doing here? You said you wouldn't be home until late.
Well I just remembered this old pile of papers...
So I thought I'd come back and look something up.
Well, what'd you come in the back door for?
You know how jumpy I am about noises in the house!
I got mr. Hotchkiss' old gun out...
I thought they'd carry a burglar outta here tonight.
I'm sorry, I guess
I just didn't think.
Well, it's a good thing I did...
I was gonna shoot and ask questions later.
This thing's got a hair trigger, too.
Well... as long as it's you, it's ok.
How 'bout some supper?
No thanks, I...
I have some stew leftover from last night.
I could heat it up for ya.
No, I found what I was looking for...
I'm not hungry, really.
I guess I'll just go up to my room, if you don't mind.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Yeah, Steve... it's positive.
There is a reading.
I said there was a positive reading.
This may be all the evidence we need to convince Barrenger.
Oh, really?
Well, snap out of it, would you, Steve?
Don't you understand
I'm giving you the ammun...
It's too late, doc!
- What's that?
- It's my resignation.
You talked to him.
No, not quite, he talked.
He said either get on his wagon or get out. Well, I'm getting out.
Well now, wait a minute.
Tear it up, you don't need it!
This is the gauge I've been telling you about.
It measures the results of cosmic rays.
Or the presence of something associated...
What is the
"something," doc?!
Well, I... I don't know but I did make a very important discovery about Elmer, here.
Has he got it?!
- Very definite...
- Though, how did he get it?
I see... you're not aware of... Elmer.
He's a very distinguished rat!
He was a passenger on our last space probe...
Before we launched our first manned rocket.
In the beginning we thought he was completely unaffected.
But he wasn't?
By no means, you see, he's in that cage alone because I can't trust him...
I don't know when he'll turn on the other rats and kill 'em.
Now, he can unlock an ordinary cage, that's why I had that padlock put on there.
Everyone else around here seems to think that...
What he does is in the range of...
An exceptional rat's capabilities.
But I don't, I think...
Elmer has thoughts.
- Are they human?
- Not necessarily.
Like this "something..."
The same "something" that was in our pilots.
Well, Steve, there's a possibility!
Jackson...
Have you been makin' this noise out here?
Come on, get down.
You know better than that!
What is this doing out here?
What a mess!
That boy!
Said he wasn't hungry and then he comes downstairs...
And knocks these jars off to this shelf!
The last time he'll get around here in my jelly, I'll tell you that!
Cleaning after this kid. God!
That boy!
Wait till I get a hold of him tomorrow.
Why the shower curtain?
Child wakin' me up in the middle of the night...
I have had enough of it!
Empty.
That oughta do it.
Mrs. Hotchkiss!
Mrs. Hotchkiss!
Operator... give me the sheriff, quick!
Sheriff Townsend.
Who?!
Paul?
Paul Lawrence?
Will you stop talking so fast?
I can't understand a word you're saying.
And stop shouting!
Yes?
Mrs. Hotchkiss?
Now, don't touch anything.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Now look, Paul...
I know how you feel, son.
But I'll get there as fast as I can.
Lawrence boy says she's been murdered.
Try and raise the county coroner, Earl.
And call my wife.
Tell her I'm liable to be up all night.
We'll have to make prints of the place.
Sure thing, Ted.
Operator, I'd like to make a long distance call, please.
Never mind, operator.
- Sheriff...
- Paul, where is she?
In her bedroom.
I... I heard a shot.
I ran down from my room,
I found her like this.
No signs of a bullet.
Did you hear anything else, like a door closing or somebody running?
No...
No, nothing.
Looks like she's been strangled.
You can see the marks on her throat... no doubt about it.
Now, tell me boy... did you ever see this gun before?
It belongs to mr. Hotchkiss...
She told me that... it had a hair trigger.
Yes, it probably fired when it fell off the table.
Now I know this is hard on you boy, but...
Anything you can remember will help. Anything at all.
Now, do you recall... did she leave any valuables around the house?
Any sizable amounts of money?
N-n... she never mentioned it to me.
Not that I know.
Well, that isn't the way rumor has it.
That is if you can believe my wife, Edith.
And you can't always do that.
That'll probably be Earl.
I'll get the door.
That should do the trick.
At least that's what my wife
Edith says... usually does for her.
2 of those and a glass of warm milk and she's out like a light.
We'll go over the routine questions in the morning.
Now Paul, just one other thing...
Maybe you don't wanna stay here in the house.
I could drive you over to my house and we'll find you another place tomorrow.
No... no, I'll be alright.
Don't worry about it.
Soap and water'll take that ink off.
You better go upstairs and try and get some sleep.
All through downstairs,
Ben...
Think you got anything?
Well, most of the prints were pretty small...
They seem to match the ones we got off the gun and the flashlight.
A... woman's prints?
Yeah, I think so but I can't tell yet...
There was one that might be interesting...
Got it off a medallion she was wearing.
How soon can we get a report?
Well, I'll tele-photo a set of these to Washington...
And run a make on 'em here, we oughta know something in... 5 or 6 hours.
What about the kid?
Earl, I don't know.
I don't like to guess on a case like this.
I just don't understand why he wants to stay in the house.
I should think he'd want to get as far away from here as possible!
He's a medical student, he's used to being around dead bodies.
Yeah, I suppose.
Now come on... we got a full night's work ahead of us.
- Let's go.
- Yeah, mayb... maybe if we're lucky...
We'll get an hours sleep, huh?
Space medicine...
Dr. Weitzberg...
Weitzberg, Weitzb...
Operator, long distance please.
I'd like to call...
A doctor Max Weitzberg.
In Washington D.C..
No, no operator,
I don't have the number.
Listen, operator... this is an emergency.
No, no, I'll hold on, ok?
No, uh... Weitzberg.
W...
E...
I, T, Z...
B...
E...
R...
G.
No... G.
B, E...
R...
G.
Thank you.
Ring him for me.
Boy, I sure could use a beer.
Who couldn't?
But we can't stop now.
But there's some in the kitchen.
Not me, not here.
Not even for a nice, cool beer?
Listen, whoever got her is probably hundreds of miles away, by now.
Just think of that long, tall, foamy brew.
You could talk a snake out of its skin.
Ok, let's take a look. With my luck, she won't even have any.
Dames likes her always keep beer around.
I told you there'd be beer in the refrigerator.
Holy...! Come here!
What's the matter?
What is it?
I don't know but I'm gettin' outta here!
Wait a minute, he might still be alive.
With a face like that and those marks on his throat?
Listen, buddy, we were supposed to collect the dame and that's all.
This guy's on his own!
He is alive, let's get him outta here.
Get the other stretcher, hurry up!
- Morning, Donna.
- 9 o'clock, right on time.
Did you get any sleep?
A little, not as much as I shoulda.
How do you do when you slip apartment?
I'm alright, Steve.
Really.
There's... this thing's gonna be a bug.
This race from the space...
You know how I feel about
Lockhart, how we all feel.
But it's more than just his loss, could be the loss of the whole human race.
- Doc and I are ???
- I understand, Steve.
What about Barrenger?
Well, ???
No...
Well, he will.
Donna... did you figure out a good excuse for me to get out of the office?
I don't wanna see him just now.
I'll do better than that...
A mr. Meidel from Security called...
Wants you to see him as soon as possible.
It sounded in a very polite way like an order.
Well, I wonder what he wants...
I have no idea.
Well, anyway it's a good excuse for to get out of here, isn't it?
I'll tell you what...
I'm going down to pick up Doc...
Gonna meet the crime committee and see what it takes us to blame.
Goodbye.
This print is quite distinctive.
Notice the scar running directly through the loop...
Makes them impossible to mistake.
Now, the one on the left was tele-photoed last night...
From the sheriff's office at Palms, a small town in California.
So?
We just thought you'd be interested in the fact...
That this print belongs to a man connected with your department.
Who?
An astronaut... by the name of Lockhart.
That's very interesting,
Mr. Meidel...
Would you tell me what Lockhart was doing, in California?
He's suspected of murdering a Mrs. Hotchkiss.
Now, Mr. Curan... would you care to tell us where we can find Lockhart?
Well, to be perfectly honest with you, Mr. Meidel...
I haven't seen Lockhart in over a week.
But if I do get some information
I'll be sure to pass it on to you.
I see...
Well, we'll leave it at that, for the moment.
Now, I don't have to warn you that this is a police matter.
And beholding information could be serious.
Even for a person of your position.
Well, I'm very much aware of that, Mr. Meidel...
And I don't wanna get mixed up in your department along with my troubles, thank you.
Meidel?
Ok, I'll be right there.
If you excuse me, gentlemen...
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Well, we can find the way out, thank you.
Well doc, would you mind telling me what that was all about?
I can't.
I think we should stop it and see Barrenger.
I always thought that fingerprints didn't lie.
Now we know Lockhart wasn't in California.
We don't know anything of that kind, Steve.
I got a call this morning at 4 o'clock from Palms, California.
There was no one on the line.
Of course I don't believe it, who could?!
And don't think I'm gonna let some fantastic story about a ghost...
Fingerprints or no fingerprints,
Stop me from carrying out this project!
- Now, wait a minute, Lee...
- I'm not waiting for anything!
Look, when I took this job...
I was given a goal and a time limit.
And the time limit has just about run out.
Lee, I think we're forgetting the facts of the situation.
I know it may all sound rather trivial, with all of your problems here...
But the fact of the matter remains that a murder has been committed.
And the prime suspect in this case happens to be one of our men!
That's right, Lee.
I gathered from the attitude of Mr. Meidel of Security...
That it won't be long before he applied real pressure, right here.
We may find ourselves right in the middle of an investigation.
However, you do have an alternative, Lee.
When Meidel calls you can gain time by simply stating that...
Lockhart had no authorization to be in California.
And at the present time, you haven't the slightest idea of where he is.
An absolutely true statement.
One, which you can't possibly be criticized for.
Steve and I can fly to Palms and investigate this... "ghost story."
May hold up the project a couple of days...
Practically nothing to lose.
Well, what do you say, Lee?
Alright, you win.
Go on, take off.
Barrenger speaking.
Yes, Mr. Meidel.
Paul?
Sheriff!
You alright?
Sure.
Where have you been?
I... just took a walk.
I... woke up, I... I guess this thing bothered me a little more than I thought. I...
I just took a walk.
But you're filthy, dirty.
You're all sweaty.
You must'a walked awfully hard.
Now, look, Paul, I'm here because an ambulance driver called me.
He told me a strange kind of a story.
Have you got anything to tell me?
No, sir.
Alright, I'll tell you what I want you to do.
I want you to stick close to the house.
I wouldn't go out at all, if I were you.
I don't care what you do, but stick close to the house. You understand?
Why don't you just go ahead and arrest me...
- And get it over with?!
- There's no charge against ya, boy!
Not yet.
I suggest you go up and get some sleep. You had a hard night.
Yes sir.
I'm telling this... really... for you...
Professor Farnstrom... and Marta.
I know you will both realize... that it is the truth.
That I am not out of my mind.
You were right, professor.
I... shouldn't... keep things to myself.
I... I... I tried to be a lone wolf and...
I guess... I wanted all the credit for myself.
Marta and I were swimming...
And up on the sand... we found something quite... interesting.
It was an arm... just an arm.
Had a... strange... covering.
I... guess...
Probably must've been...
From...
A... space suit!
When'd this thing arrive, Earl?
- Why, what is it?
- It's from Washington.
We asked for a confirmation on those fingerprints at the Hotchkiss house.
Well, they say they belong to a guy
I never heard of, Lockhart!
- Who?!
- Melvin Lockhart.
Do you know a Melvin Lockhart?
Anybody in this town by that name? Never heard of one.
It isn't the half of it.
- They're movin' in.
- Who's movin' in?
Washington!
Great Caesar's ghost!
Can you tell me why they want in on a case like this?
A widow lady get's herself killed...
A prime suspect...
The only possible suspect
I've got right here in my hands.
I was gonna make an arrest within a couple hours!
- Kid?
- Most certainly the kid.
- Thank you.
- You know the way he's been acting!
The only one that could possibly have done it.
Now they come up with a man named Lockhart.
And they're taking over.
Earl, I'll tell ya what's happened.
They've got so many fingerprints in Washington they've got 'em all mixed up!
Well, what's the use?
We can't buck 'em, not yet.
They also wanna have us put a guard on the house.
"Nobody gets in."
Want me to go over and sit on the place?
Yeah, you better.
And while you're there... keep an eye on young Lawrence.
I s'pose I shoulda picked him up long before this, but I...
Just didn't want him to have a record until I was 100% sure.
And then after those Washington boys get through fooling around...
I'm afraid he's still gonna be it.
Now, I'd bet $100 on it!
Ok, I'll get right over there.
Right.
- Yes, what can I do for you?
- Afternoon, sheriff, I'm Steve Curan.
This is doc Weitzberg and we're from Washington D.C..
Well, boy! You government boys really work fast!
You got here in a hurry, let me get you some coffee.
- Well, thank you, no...
- No, thanks.
Say, tell me... who's this man, Lockhart?
Wait a minute, let's not get started off on the wrong foot here, sheriff.
Yeah, I know.
You ask the questions, I don't.
Well, you boys are from the Bureau, aren't you?
Well, that's just it, sheriff.
We're from... Space Operations.
Spa... Space Operations?!
Now, wait a minute, boys.
This is Palms, California.
Population: 2.306.
A woman gets knocked off and...
We know all about that, sheriff.
We just want to ask you a few questions, is all.
About this very man, Lockhart.
Has he been seen?
Well, I don't know who you boys are or why you're here.
As far as I'm concerned, you've got no authority at all to ask me questions...
Now, wait a minute, we didn't come out here to get pushed around, sheriff.
Now Steve, just a minute... sheriff?
As a matter of fact, all we want is your permission to go through the house.
Nobody goes through the house. Not till the boys from the Bureau get here.
And I've got an armed guard that says nobody does.
- We just talked to the sheriff...
- Yeah, he called me.
Didn't change his mind, did he?
Nope!
Well, uh... do you mind if we just look around outside?
Nothin' to see, but help yourself.
Do you have any theories?
Yeah, somebody killer her.
That's my theory.
Well, Steve, I guess we might as well be own our way.
Doc, you notice they don't build houses like this, anymore.
Go to rear
No, they... they sure don't, do they?
Well, we'll see you around.
- See you later.
- Yeah.
Whatever we gotta get done, we better get done fast.
That cold fish gonna be around here any second.
Could you distinguish whether it was a man or a woman?
Well, it was a pretty quick glance doc, I'm not sure.
Look, Steve.
"Come back tonight after dark.
The back door will be unlocked."
"I have something important to tell you."
"Be careful of the deputy."
No signature.
Well, I didn't have a date tonight, did you?
Well, it looks like we both have now, doesn't it?
Hey!
Paul?
Paul, are you here?
Paul!
What are you doing here?
Get out.
Paul, are you alright?
I read in the paper about poor Mrs. Hotchkiss.
- Such a terrible thing!
- Never mind.
Get out of here.
Paul...?
That thing on the beach...
Just can't get it out of my mind.
- Have you told anyone about it?
- No.
Get out!
Why are you staying here?
It's no good!
You can come to our house!
Marta, please!
Marta, what are you doin' here?!
Harrison, get her out of this house. Just get her out!
You just get back to your room.
There's no one allowed in here,
Marta, you'll have to leave.
Now wait a minute...
I've a right to see Paul!
I'm a friend of his!
Get her out of this house!
Come on, Marta, out.
Come on!
And don't let her come back!
Mortuary
Hope
I didn't know she had any relatives back East at all!
I know she used to speak of an uncle, but he was in England or some place.
Where'd you say you were from, again?
- Pennsylvania.
- New York.
- He's from New York.
- And he's from Pennsylvania...
We heard about the tragedy and flew out here.
I see... well, uh... here she is.
You can take a look, if you like.
Really looks very well...
Of course, we got the body quite soon after the, uh... crime.
And there weren't any, uh, marks... except the ones on her throat.
You know, sometimes, in cases like this...
Yes, we... we know.
Looks, uh... very well, I think.
Yes, Steve. Yes!
What's he doing?
What is that thing?
That wards off evil spirits.
I see.
There's absolutely no doubt.
Ah... thanks very much.
We're satisfied.
And you're absolutely right, she looks very well.
Hello?
Hello?!
Anybody here?
- Looks like we're alone.
- Yeah...
Wonder where our little friend is?
I think he was watching alright... he'll be down any minute, don't worry.
If we could only turn on a light!
We do and that deputy'd be here in a second.
Yeah, that's right. I gotta keep this flashlight away from the windows, too.
- Steve!
- What?
Give me the light.
Put it on the gauge.
- Yeah...
- What do you see?
Well there's an indication, it's... it's faint, but it's... definite.
Yeah, so I see...
Steve! Keep it over here.
Yeah...
Well, what's it read?
- This is very strange!
- What's that?
Well, there's a very strong reading right here on top of the shelf...
Nothing above, or below.
Well now, that's ridiculous, doc.
No man could get up on that shelf, it would never hold him!
Doesn't have to be a man...
Lockhart's fingerprints... remember?
Yeah...
Well, perhaps we can trace the trail back to where it came from.
- Keep the light on the gauge.
- Alright.
Yes... look!
Stronger.
Look, Steve!
It's right up the wall.
Steve...
It's on the ceiling!
Doc... what man do you happen to know that walks on the ceiling?
Turn off the light!
Alright, let him move first.
Hello?
Hello?!
Come on, say something!
Put the light on him.
Alright! Back into the house...
Come on! Back up.
No...
What are you two doin' back here?
Well, don't bother about us, go after that maniac!
Well now, you must've seen him, he rain right past you!
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Into the house,
I'll call the sheriff.
Look officer, you're wasting time.
Go after that man!
Shut up and get back into the house!
- But I...
- Alright, doc...
Nothing we can do about it right now...
I know I'll never remember this stuff!
Ibsen, O'Niell...
If I just get a D,
I'll be happy!
Do you understand it, Marta?
What's the matter, pal?
You collapsed?
Hey... kid!
That exam's tomorrow and you've got to pass.
You know they expect twice as much from foreign students.
It wasn't the sleep...
It's just that...
I know, you're concerned about Paul.
But he'll be ok.
Patsy...!
I just don't understand it, what's happened to him? It's just terrible!
He screamed at me... why is he staying in that house?
Gee, I don't know...
Pop hasn't said a word about it at home...
Well, there's no use me asking him...
He just won't tell me anything about stuff like that.
They're keeping him a prisoner!
Well, he... may be a suspect.
Paul didn't kill anyone.
That, I'm sure of.
Pop always says you can't be sure what anyone is going to do...
In certain circumstances.
He didn't kill anyone...
I'm sure of that!
I thought it's perhaps time for a little rest and refreshment.
You know studying at such a furious pace without pause can be very exhausting.
I'm afraid that's not the case.
- At least not for me...
- No?
Any case, there are sandwiches and coke...
And I've made quite a tempting, little snack.
You've sold me, professor.
Lead the way.
And you, Marta?
Forgive me, grandpa...
I'm really not hungry.
I haven't been studying and I better start,
I'm afraid, if I don't want to flunk tomorrow.
Well... as you wish.
Patsy and I will have to eat extra portions, then.
And I'm just the girl who can do it, too.
Be back in a few minutes, pal.
Paul!
Could I talk to you for a minute?
Yes, of course.
Come inside.
Paul, I've been so worried!
I know...
Listen.
I'm going away.
Away? When?!
Now.
Just as soon as I get rid of something that...
Must be destroyed.
I just could go without saying goodbye, first.
Paul... what's the matter?
What are you afraid of?
Tell me!
I can't!
Just one thing I wanna tell you...
I didn't kill Mrs. Hotchkiss.
I know that, Paul.
You couldn't have!
But there are people who think I did.
Sheriff Townsend...
What's the difference? If you didn't, everything will be alright.
Grandfather will help you.
He loves you very much, Paul.
Don't touch me.
Listen...
I... I can't explain it, but...
I... I'm all mixed up.
And then, and there's something terrible that's happened to me... and I... I... I... and I...
There's only one person that I could have relied on in this world, and...
I almost killed him a few minutes ago!
What do you mean?
Never mind, it would take too long to explain... I don't have the time, I...
There are times when I'm alright, and then I'm not, and then I'm...
And then when I'm myself and I'm not.
And the periods when I'm myself I...
Are getting shorter, and shorter, to wh...
- Do you understand?!
- No...
Well, then don't try!
I gotta get outta here.
Leave me alone.
No, Paul. I'm not going to let you go.
If you're ill, we'll help you.
You can come and stay with us. And we'll take care of you until you're well.
Listen, Paul...
Do you remember when you asked me that question?
Whether I was going back home after summer was over?
I was only teasing you!
I never meant to go!
I want to stay here.
I want to be here with you!
- I love you, Paul!
- Oh, no, Marta... you don't understand.
I won't... I won't let you run away!
No... no!
No, get away from me!
Paul?
Paul, what's the matter with you?
What is it?
What's the matter with you?!
Marta?
Marta?!
Sheriff, we're sorry.
We shoulda listened to you.
We had no idea the boy was so dangerous.
You 2 should've thought of that when you helped him escape.
I'm bookin' both of ya.
Be reasonable, now.
Look, if he does any harm to that Farnstrom girl I'll show you how unreasonable I can be!
Earl, take the shortcut down Payne Avenue.
My daughter's at the Farnstrom place, too.
Paul...
Paul's face...
It was white.
It was horrible!
There was an arm... lying in the sand.
May I speak with her, professor?
For a moment.
Marta... it was Paul Lawrence, wasn't it?
Paul...?
Paul?
Not... not really Paul.
It was in the sand.
It was an arm.
Lying in the sand...
A human arm.
It was Paul Lawrence, wasn't it?
Hey, his car's gone! It was parked right there at the curb.
Put a call out on the car...
I'll make a double-check inside.
Unit 1 to Control...
Paul?
39-A, code 7...
Spotted him heading down the county dump road but he gave 'em the slip.
Well you stick close to the house, just in case. We'll check with you later.
39-A, clear.
What's this?
Metallic cloth, it looks like.
I've never seen anything like that.
It's the material used for outer space travel.
Lockhart's.
I could bet my life.
I'll circle around this way.
There he is.
Wait a minute, you're not gonna gun him down, are ya?
He's a killer. If he doesn't come quietly, I'll have to shoot him.
But he's just a kid!
Sure, he's just a kid!
I know all about kids like him.
The county jail's full of 'em!
Paul!
Paul, don't do anything foolish!
That's right, Paul...
I don't wanna hurt ya.
Now put that bottle down and come over here quietly.
Come on now, boy...
I wouldn't wanna use this gun!
Now, put the bottle down so we can get back into town!
Paul... listen to me!
You didn't hurt her.
Marta is alright.
Paul... come on, now.
Are you gonna put that bottle down or am I gonna have to take it away from ya?
We better get him to a hospital right away!
Come on.
Doc!
Doc, come over here!
Fingerprints don't lie.
34, clear.
Ok you two, let's go!
Not a trace.
Not a solitary trace.
What have I got, doc?
Nerves, my boy.
Just hypertension, now.
What you had is an entirely different matter.
We'll talk about it when you get well.
What I had?
What happened to it?
Let's just say that life can exist under different temperatures and...
A fever of 104 was enough to finish it off.
Fortunately for you... and for us.
I just talked to Barrenger, he wants to see it immediately.
Good.
I'm glad he does. The sooner we get rid of it, the better.
Marta! Come on in.
Is he alright?
For a little while, I think it'll do him more good than harm. Excuse me.
Are you sure you got that thing fixed so it won't ever get away again?
Don't worry about it, sheriff, it's in a metal box and it's locked.
And in about 2 minutes it's gonna be on an airplane and no one will ever see it again.
Well, that'll be alright with me.
- Goodbye.
- Sheriff.
Come on, tell me.
Did you mean what you said last night about staying here?
Now, don't play games.
I'm too weak.
How can I help myself?
You know women can't resist weak men.
Then you're gonna stay?
Just you wait.
Just wait till
I get out of this bed.
Just you...
Wonder what all of the secrecy's about this time?
There ya go, stickin' your nose into somethin' that's none of your business.
All we're supposed to do is deliver it to the airport.
Yeah, but those people inside got me curious.
You know that fella from Washington, the way he kept looking at it...
Asking me if I was sure it was locked?
I'd give anything to take a look inside.
Not me, I don't care what's in it.
Come on, let's get movin'.
That's your trouble, no curiosity.
You'll never get any place without curiosity.
- You gotta find out about things.
- Yeah?
Well, I like it that way.
What harm will it do to take a look? I've got the key.
It might be dangerous.
What do you think, it's alive?!
You don't see any holes in the box.
You think it'll bite you, or something?
You're always talkin' me into doin' somethin' I don't wanna do.
Have I ever steered you wrong?
The end
Gentlemen...
We are gathered here today as representatives... of some of the greatest design teams in the world.
We are here to listen to a proposal... from a Mr. X... a man who is 50 years ahead of his time...
A man who is undoubtedly... the world's greatest aircraft designer.
The daddy of them all.
Mr. X?
Are you with us?
Yes... l am with you,
Mr. President.
Gentlemen, you must forgive the extraordinary... security precautions taken today.
But when l tell you that Mr. X... is none other than the man who designed... the International
Rescue aircraft... you will understand the importance of security.
Mr. X has a proposition to put to us... for a revolutionary new type of aircraft. lt is, perhaps...
The most exciting moment in the history of our company.
And now, gentlemen, the moment has come.
What is it to be?
An aircraft that flies 10 times the speed of sound...
A space vehicle that travels the speed of light? lf l were able to guess...
Mr. X would not be here today.
And now, Mr. X, it is with great excitement... that we await breathlessly... the details of your new design.
Well, gentlemen... l thought it would be a good idea... in this day and age of, uh, speed...
And, uh, things like that... to build an...airship.
An airship?
An airship?
A beautiful island in the pacific... secret base of
International Rescue...
So far undetected.
Outwardly, the luxury home of millionaire ex-astronaut...
Jeff Tracy.
Now, let's have a rundown... on the International
Rescue craft.
At the moment, there are 5.
Thunderbird 1... sleek, first, and fast.
Thunderbird 2... giant transporter.
Carries all the rescue gear to the danger zone.
Thunderbird 3... designed for space rescue.
Thunderbird 4... capable of withstanding the pressure of the depths.
Thunderbird 5... space monitor.
Capable of receiving or intercepting... distress calls from any part of the world.
And l'm telling you, Brains, in no uncertain terms...
That we now need a Thunderbird 6.
Sure, Mr. Tracy.
But can you give me some sort of a steer? l like to work to a specification.
Specification?
You didn't need to work to a specification... when you designed that airship... for the New World
Aircraft Corporation.
That's right. l didn't.
And what happened?
They laughed.
Yeah, that's right.
They laughed.
And then they built it.
There you are, Brains.
Your specially commissioned painting of Skyship 1.
Thanks, Virgil. lt's really great.
But l guess that's about the nearest... l'm gonna get to it for some time. l'm sorry about this,
Brains.
But l've got this feeling, and l know l'm not wrong.
We desperately need a Thunderbird 6.
That's OH, Mr. Tracy.
Of course, l would have liked... to have been on the maiden voyage.
Sure.
But at least
International Rescue... will be represented by
Alan, Tin Tin, and Penelope.
They'll give you a full report.
So, you like the painting, eh?
Say, talking of painting...
Alan?
Yes, Dad?
You better get cleaned up.
Don't forget, it's your farewell dinner tonight.
Just 10 more minutes, Dad, and l'll be through.
How's she looking?
Great. Just great. l finished our packing, Mr. Tracy.
Our packing?
Tin Tin, come here a minute.
Certainly, Mr. Tracy. ls there anything wrong?
Tin Tin, Alan wanted to travel to England... in an unconventional way.
Well, l've organized that.
But it's gonna be a long journey... and not exactly the way for a young lady to travel... in this day and age.
You are traveling by scheduled airline.
But Mr. Tracy... l want to travel with Alan.
Now, Alan leaves tomorrow... and you leave in 2 weeks' time.
Understand?
Come on, Mother, over here.
You'll get a good view.
Well, l guess we've seen a lot of launchings... but this will beat all.
Say, where's Tin Tin? l don't know, Dad.
Strange.
Unusual for her not to see Alan off.
Here she comes.
So long, folks.
Dearest Brains... l know how much this project means to you... and l feel that you, not l, should be making this trip.
But, of course, you are the one person who cannot be spared. l shall be thinking of you.
Love, Tin Tin.
P.S... l stowed aboard the Tiger with Alan.
She's what?
That's right, Mr. Tracy.
She's aboard the Tiger with Alan.
He flies through the air
With the greatest of ease
The daring young man in his flying machine
His movements are graceful
All girls he can please
And my heart is stolen away lsn't it a lovely ou_it? lt belonged to my ancestor, the Duchess of Crighton Ward.
Well? What do you think,
Parker? l think it's very elegant, milady.
Mind you, l prefer mini-skirts m'self... but l suppose it's appropriate... that you should be dressed like that...
For the revival of the airship, so to speak.
Thank you, Parker.
And that ou_it suits you beautifully.
Well, if Alan's on schedule... he should be arriving at any moment.
Yes, milady. l understand that he's been on his way now for 2 weeks.
That's him, Parker.
We must go onto the roof and see him land.
Come on.
There it is, Tin Tin.
Yes, Alan!
It looks lovely!
OH. You know what to do. l expect he's coming in to land.
Milady, he's coming straight for us! l don't believe it.
Hi, Penny. Hi, Parker.
Alan, l'm so glad you're safe.
You gave us quite a scare.
Gee, l like your ou_it, Penelope.
Yes, l was rather pleased with it myself.
Uh, uh, excuse me.
All the family send their love to you.
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. Alan. Excuse me.
What is it, Parker?
Uh, your aircraft, sir.
It's got no pilot. l--l just thought l'd point it out to you, sir.
Oh, forget about it,
Parker. l'm finished with it now.
Now, you were saying,
Penelope...
Mr. Alan, please!
Don't you understand? lt's gonna crash into the house!
Parker! What has got into you?
Sorry about that, Alan.
Stone the crows... lt's going to land on its own.
Parker? Milady?
Tin Tin's an excellent pilot.
Don't you think, Parker?
You should have seen
Parker's face, Tin Tin. lt was the funniest thing l've ever seen in my life. l can just imagine it.
Of course, l saw immediately what Alan was up to because l knew you were on board.
Jeff called me yesterday. l could hardly keep a straight face.
Come in.
All the baggage is aboard, milady.
Thank you, Parker.
Now, there's only one thing
Ieft to do before we leave.
Bon voyage.
Bon voyage.
Bon voyage, milady.
As president of the New
World Aircraft Corporation... this flight is of paramount importance to me.
The fact that members of International Rescue... will be on the maiden flight... enables us to achieve worldwide publicity. ln order to make this possible in the first place... we have given assurances to them... that the strictest security arrangements... will be enforced.
That is why the airfield is cleared of all personnel.
The passengers are due to arrive in, um...
30 minutes.
Contact.
Virg, l can see them at 2 o'clock!
OH. l've got them, Scott.
Right.
Operation escort, go!
This is what l call driving in style, milady. lt isn't every Rolls-Royce that has an aircraft escort.
OH, all checks complete.
-Martin?
-Yes, sir.
-Lane?
-Yes, sir.
-Carter?
-Yes, sir.
-Hogarth?
-Yes, sir.
OH. Return to your posts... and await the arrival of the passengers.
Hold it right there.
Quickly, we haven't much time.
Scott from Penelope.
Come aboard with the others and have a farewell drink.
We'll meet you in the ballroom.
The ballroom!
May l book the first dance?
No, Scott.
It isn't what it seems.
You'll see.
And now, by the courtesy... of the New World
Aircraft Corporation... we bring you the
Drinking Half Hour!
Now, milady, what will it be? l think this occasion calls for champagne... all around, Parker.
All around, milady?
All around, Parker.
And now,
Iadies and gentlemen... on behalf of the New World
Aircraft Corporation... l welcome you aboard
Skyship 1.
As you know, this is the maiden flight. lt is, of course, a great honor... for us to have such distinguished guests.
You can be assured that the crew and myself... will do everything in our power... to make this a trip to remember.
Well, bon voyage.
Bon voyage!
Godspeed, milady.
OH, one minute to takeoff.
Now, we know the ship is fully automated.
Everything is preprogrammed-- height, speed, course.
We're all supposed to be trained men.
The only way that our cover will be broken... will be if anything goes wrong with the ship.
Takeoff now, 30 seconds.
Well, we're off.
Come in.
Dinner is served in the bottle room, milady.
Well, they've gone.
May we have the blinds drawn, Captain?
The entire operation of this Skyship...
Lady Penelope, is totally automatic.
As the light falls, the curtains will draw automatically.
Of course.
That's just the sort of thing...
Brains would have thought of.
Well, it looks as if we're all set for a lovely, peaceful holiday.
Calling Black Phantom.
This is White Ghost.
Calling Black Phantom, this is White Ghost.
Come in, Black Phantom.
Come in, Black Phantom.
Have disposed of cargo.
Operation Ambush underway.
Calling
International Rescue.
This is Lady Penelope.
Jeff, l want you to send
Thunderbird 1 and 2... to a disused airfield...
10 miles south of Casablanca. lnternational fix system
24-04. Reference E.
Ensure that Brains is aboard.
This is imperative.
Do not acknowledge this transmission.
Will call later with further details. lt's going to be difficult.
That's what we're paid for.
Now, l've had this whole place bugged. l want every word she speaks on this trip... to be recorded.
Whenever possible, l'll talk to her myself... and maneuver the conversation... in the right direction.
Right. Get to work.
OH, Carter, breakfast is served.
Start recording.
Morning, Alan.
Morning, Penny.
Morning, Alan.
Breakfast over New York.
What an experience.
This is really the way to travel.
Yeah, it's great.
Only thing is, as the ship's fully automated... if anything should go wrong with the computer... we could hit one of these skyscrapers... and then we'd really be in trouble.
Then, Alan... it would just be a simple case of... calling
International Rescue.
OH.
Calling International Rescue.
And now, gentlemen... it is with pride that l present to you Thunderbird 6.
Now, so that l'm able to demonstrate... this new machine properly... l have built this radio-controlled model.
The situation?
Man trapped in top floor of burning skyscraper.
Thunderbird 6 drives up to the building.
The helium balloon now rises... lifting a plastic hose into the air.
When the balloon reaches the correct height... the reel is locked off. l don't get it, Brains.
What's the point?
This is the point.
And so you see, gentlemen... another international rescue is made possible.
Well, Mr. Tracy, what do you think?
Well, it's, uh, certainly ingenious, Brains.
But it means building a vehicle... that gives us only one means of rescue.
The end product just doesn't justi_ the cost. l--l'm sorry. l'm afraid you'll have to scrap it... and start again.
Too bad about the wasted effort.
Wasted effort, Mr. Tracy?
Heh heh.
What's a mere 28 days...
Working day and night...
Think nothing of it.
We must be descending. l'm getting butterflies. l always do when we lose height.
You're absolutely right,
Lady Penelope.
We'll soon be flying over the Grand Canyon... at zero feet.
An automated announcement... will tell us when it's the right time.
Don't worry, you won't miss a thing.
There. You can see our exact position.
The Grand Canyon.
You know, l was once hopelessly lost... in a jet plane, and then, at last... l made contact with the Grand.
Was l glad to hear that voice!
You are directly over the Grand Canyon.
Your position

Correction, Captain Foster. lnternational fix system
24-04. Reference E.
Of course. 24-04.
Heh. l didn't think l'd ever forget that.
Ladies and gentlemen... we are now approaching the Grand Canyon. lf you care to take up your positions on the balcony... you will be in good time... to get the most advantageous view point. l think it's the most beautiful sight l've ever seen.
Come across to the other side of the ship.
There's an even better view over there.
Yes, let's do that. l really don't think l like Captain Foster.
Ah, he's just an old man.
Thunderbirds 1 and 2... l trust the beaujolais was to your liking, Parker?
And now, how about a cigar?
As you know, milady... l've been spending quite a lot of time... with the stewards... drinking and all that sort of thing.
Well, what worries me-- they--they don't seem to know as much... about the ship as they ought to.
Thank you, Parker. l've had my own thoughts on the matter. l'm glad you told me.
Yes. Well, uh-- sorry if l disturbed you, milady.
You were quite right,
Parker.
Good night.
Good night, milady.
Yes, Penelope? l've just had some information from Parker. l'm a little uneasy.
Tell me, what do you think of Captain Foster? l don't go for him,
Penelope.
He's a little too smooth for my liking.
Tell me, Alan, has he been questioning you... about International Rescue?
As a matter of fact, he has.
Well, not directly, mind you... but the conversation always seems to lead that way. l think we'll have to go into the situation... a little more closely. l don't like the sound of it.
The storm seems to be getting worse. l think you'd better come in here.
We need to discuss this right away.
Oh, well, um...
Perhaps we are allowing our imaginations... to run away with us.
After all... everyone's interested in International Rescue. lt's only natural he should ask questions.
Oh. So you don't think there's anything... to worry about, Penelope?
No. After all, they have all been screened.
They're carefully selected men.
That was a close one.
Put on the edited tape.
Right.
One thing's for sure.
We gotta play this really cool from now on.
Lady Penelope, l underestimated you.
Calling International Rescue.
Jeff, l want you to send
Thunderbirds 1 and 2. lnternational fix system.
24-04. Reference E.
OH. Continue recording.
Doesn't sound as if we'll get much more tonight.
When l was talking to you just now, Alan... l discovered a bugging device in a lamp by my bed. l wondered why you'd changed your attitude... so abruptly.
What's our next move?
For the moment, nothing.
We know we're being bugged, but we don't know why.
We must just be on the alert.
OH. l'll mosey around... and see what l can find out.
Of course l understand,
Mr. Tracy. lt isn't quite the thing you had in mind.
Of course l don't mind designing yet another one.
You know, Scott, one of the remarkable things... about Brains is that he never loses his temper.
Well, if he did, l wouldn't blame him... after all the work he's done.
Upset? Me upset?
Of course l'm not upset!
Go ahead, John.
Father, l've just received a message... from Lady Penelope. lt was sent in scrambled electronic code.
Right, John. Let's have it. lt's just coming out of the descrambler now. lt reads, ''Ship bugged.
Reason unknown.
''Am investigating.
''lmperative, no communication from you.
''Will contact you when we have a lead.
''Signed, Penelope.''
F.A.B., John. Heep in touch. l don't like the sound of it, Dad.
We've gotta do something about this.
Yeah. But what?
Well, why not radio the police... at their next port of call?
Have the crew interrogated.
No. Whoever it is on that ship... that is looking for information... is probably an agent for a larger organization. lf we're to protect ourselves, we've gotta... wait for them to show their hand.
You lead an interesting but secretive life.
Your lifeline shows that you will meet many dangers.
You will become involved with a handsome stranger.
You would be well to let your heart guide you.
Well...stone the crows.
Beautiful, Alan.
But it's far too expensive.
Right. We'll take it.
You won't regret it, sir. lt will bring you much happiness.
Oh, Alan, it's been such a lovely day. l just wish it could never end.
The sari suits you very well, Penelope. lt was a very kind thought,
Captain. Thank you.
Did you get anything interesting today, Tin Tin?
Yes. Alan bought me this beautiful ring.
He paid far too much money for it... but l'm very thrilled with it.
Buying a ring for a young
Iady is prem significant... to me, Alan. Don't tell me you're going to desert... the league of bachelors. l'm afraid not,
Captain Foster.
The life l lead in
International Rescue... is far too dangerous to ask anyone... to share it with me.
For me, at the moment, marriage is out of the question.
That's right,
Captain Foster.
We all of us lead dedicated lives... in International Rescue.
And now, if you'll excuse me, l think l'll retire.
But wouldn't you like another drink?
Thank you, Captain, but no. lt's been a lovely, but very tiring day. l'm going to bed.
Oh, so soon? l'm afraid so.
Good night, everyone.
So, your rooms aren't bugged... but the lounge, bar, and dining room are.
All places where l go.
It would seem it's me... they want the information from.
But what? lf we knew that, we'd know the answer to everything.
Have you found any trace of the receiver?
Parker's had no luck.
None. The only place l haven't searched... is the gravity compensation room.
Well, the trip comes to an end in 14 days' time.
Whatever move they're going to make... must be made before we get back to England.
So we'll soon know. l think l can claim to have been to most places... in the world, but, oddly enough... l've never seen the pyramids. l've never seen them, either.
Well, we won't have long to wait.
We land in 15 minutes.
Oh, how dreadful.
What is it, Penelope?
There's been a terrible air crash.
A DX 102 airliner... tried to make a forced
Ianding on a disused... airfield 10 miles south of Casablanca. lts nose wheel collapsed... and the aircraft blew up, killing all aboard.
At last, we've got it. l've got to hand it to you, Carter... that newspaper idea of yours was just great.
Now, complete the editing. l want to hear that final message as soon as possible.
OH, girls, let's go.
Don't forget your camera, Penelope.
Don't worry. l've got it right here.
So, you see, Jeff, we nearly lost Parker.
Ah, now here's the coded bit.
We are enjoying our trip and looking forward... to our last port of call,
Switzerland.
Scott, take this along to Brain's lab... and get it decoded.
Yes, sir.
Oh, that's all right,
Mr. Tracy. l just love having my designs turned down.
Gee, Brains, your beautiful model.
Oh, h-hi, Scott.
Yeah. It just slipped out of my hand.
Dad wants you to decode this right away.
Gee, l wish there was something we could do to help them.
Don't worry. l've got a feeling... it won't be long now.
Mr. Tracy?
Yes, Brains?
Decoding of Penelope's
Ietter is as follows...
''lnterest is in me.
Reason unknown.
''Continue to stand by.''
Thanks, Brains.
Well, we now know that they're bugging only Penelope.
They're interested in what she says.
Now, what could
Penelope say... that would mean so much to someone with designs... on International Rescue?
Jeff, l want you to send...
Thunderbirds 1 and 2 to a disused airfield...
10 miles south of Casablanca. lnternational fix system.
24-04. Reference E.
Ensure that Brains is aboard.
This is imperative.
Do not acknowledge this transmission.
Will call later with further details.
Perfect. Just perfect.
OH. Now, what next?
Now, watch carefully.
Tomorrow, we make our
Iast stop--Switzerland. lt certainly is a fantastic car you have, Penelope.
The only one of its kind in the world, Captain Foster.
When those skis appeared out of the bottom... l just couldn't believe my eyes.
Oh, it has many other devices, Captain.
Many of them still top secret.
Switching to full boost, milady.
How are you doing, Tin Tin?
Fine. Just fine.
Switch in thrusters.
OH.
Right, have you decided what you're going to eat?
Mmm. l think l'll start with avocado.
Tin Tin?
Artichoke, please.
Likewise.
Ah. And for me the speciality of the house.
This is a cute place. lt's certainly imaginative.
Let's hope the service is as good.
Well, l guess this is for us.
Gee, what a novel idea. lt must have been fun traveling in trains... like this years ago.
Well, let's unload the cargo.
As Parker would say,
''lt looks a real good nosh.''
Talking of Parker... what's happened to him?
Surely he's not still outside?
But, of course.
The car is heated, you know.
11 :OO. We must go.
The skyship is programmed to take off at midnight.
As a matter of interest,
Captain... what would happen if you didn't get back on time?
Your dream holiday would just come to an end.
And now, Cinderella, we must go.
Are we clear, Parker?
Quite clear, milady.
You debugged the whole place, Parker?
No need, milady. It was already done for me.
There's not a hidden microphone anywhere, milady.
They've all been removed.
That can only mean one thing.
They've got the information they wanted. What now?
Parker, what have you to report?
Well, milady, they've been recording you on a tape machine... in the gravity compensation room. l managed to get a look in there.
They've been editing the tape--that was obvious.
And now they've got the tape machine... linked to a radio transmitter.
The jigsaw's nearly completed but not quite.
Parker, issue the guns.
They're in the false compartment... at the bottom of my blue suitcase.
From now on, it's emergency standby.
Black Phantom from White Ghost.
Message will be transmitted
1000 hours tomorrow morning.
Gentlemen, the Thunderbird machines... will be arriving here at approximately...
1100 hours tomorrow morning.
The final phase of Operation
Ambush has commenced.
OH. Rewind and stand by.
OH. Ready.
15 seconds.
Calling International Rescue.
This is Lady Penelope.
Jeff, l want you to send
Thunderbirds 1 and 2... to a disused airfield...
10 miles south of Casablanca. lnternational fix system.
24-04. Reference E.
Ensure that Brains is aboard.
This is imperative.
Do not acknowledge this transmission.
Will call later with further details.
The Thunderbird machines should be arriving... in approximately
10 minutes.
Stand by. lf pilots offer any resistance as they leave their machines... shoot them down. l've got it.
Penelope, l've got! lt's the only possible answer.
They've been recording your voice, right?
Right.
They've been editing the tape, right?
Right.
Editing is a form of rearranging.
They've been rearranging your words... to make you say something that they wanted you to say... and then they've transmitted it.
Now, who's the one person... who would act on your instructions?
Why, Jeff Tracy.
Roger, Scott.
Understand that you are at disused airfield.
Call me as soon as you've landed.
F.A.B.
Go ahead, Penny.
Jeff, this is an emergency.
Have you received a message from me?
Yes, Penelope. The boys are just about to land... at the rendezvous you requested.
Jeff, l haven't sent a message.
This is a trap.
Now, remember... just one sign of resistance from those pilots... and let them have it.
Thunderbird to base.
Thanks, Dad.
You gave us the warning just in time.
Setting course now to rendezvous with Skyship 1.
That's right, Scott.
The message was a recording of my voice.
Now, the quicker you arrive, the better for us.
You've got a fix on our position.
F.A.B.
OH, l've received a message from Black Phantom... to say the Thunderbird machines were landing.
By now, they must've taken over the ships... and shortly, they'll be on their way... to rendezvous with us.
Right, the playacting's over.
Round up our International
Rescue guests.
They're unsuspecting, so they won't be armed.
Not so unsuspecting,
Captain Foster.
Raise your hands, all of you. lt sounds as if Alan needs some help.
Tin Tin, l'll leave you my compact.
You can keep in touch with the boys.
F.A.B., Penny.
Come on, Parker.
Quickly, Parker.
Lane, get the other one as hostage. Quick.
OH, Foster, the numbers are eVen nOW... and we can outshoot you, you know that.
Throw your guns down and give yourselves up. l suggest you throw your guns down. lf you don't, you can say good-bye to Tin Tin.
Father, l've lost contact with Skyship 1.
Right, Scott.
At what position... do you expect to rendezvous with it?
According to my calculations, at approximately 10,OOO feet.
About 5 miles east of Dover.
Well, all you can do, Scott... is beat the hell out of those machines... and get there as soon as you can.
F.A.B.
Very smart, Penelope.
So you radioed your base?
That's right, Mr. Foster.
You should know that you can't outwit International Rescue. l'm not so sure.
The game isn't over yet.
We have you all as our hostages.
When the Thunderbird machines arrive... l've got an idea they're going to do... just what we tell them to.
Meanwhile, the gravity compensating machine... has come to a standstill.
The jet engines on this bus... are to give it forward movement only.
The ship can't maintain height... unless the gravity compensators are working. l'm well aware of the situation.
We're losing height quite slowly. lt'll be half an hour yet before there's any real danger. lt'll be half an hour yet before there's any real danger.
Martin, go up on the top deck... and radio down as soon as those
Thunderbirds arrive. Right.
Father, l'm at rendezvous point.
No sign of Skyship 1. l don't understand it, Scott. lt's a big ship.
It'd be hard to miss.
Oh, wait. l can see it. lt's about 8,OOO feet below me. l don't get it.
According to the New World pre-programmed schedule... it should be at 10,OOO feet at this point. l'm going down to take a look.
F.A.B.
Foster, Thunderbird 1 directly above us.
OH, Martin.
Right. Untie them. l want you all up on the top deck... and no false moves.
OH, father, l'm alongside. l can see one of the stewards standing... on the top deck.
Otherwise, no sign of life.
When Thunderbird 2 arrives, we'll attempt to board her.
Be with you in about
5 minutes, Scott.
OH, Virgil.
Dad, there's trouble ahead.
Dad, Skyship 1 is losing height.
Why? l don't know.
About one mile ahead is an early warning system... with interceptor towers.
The estimated height:
1,200 feet.
Below it is a missile site.
The way it looks from here...
Skyship 1 is on a collision course.
The only thing that can save it is its height.
But l've got my doubts. lt's a tower head.
We're going to hit it!
How far away is it? l don't know.
About a quarter of a mile. l'm coming up.
Dad, there's going to be a collision.
You'd better alert... all emergency services down on the ground. lt's a missile base about 5 miles east of Dover.
F.A.B.
What's the situation, Scott?
Well, the ship's swaying on top of one of the towers. lf that tower gives way... or the ship loses its balance... it's going to drop like a stone... it's going to drop like a stone... right onto that missile site below.
Come on, quickly.
Up on the top deck and move!
We've crashed, Foster.
Don't you understand?
Throw your gun away.
We're all in this together now. l said move!
Scott, l've been listening to your transmission. l've sighted Skyship. l'm coming in straight over the top.
Will lower escape unit.
Brains is already in there.
F.A.B. ls Brains armed?
He ought to be.
We've no idea what's going on. lt's OH, Dad. l've taken care of that.
Good boy.
Attention! Attention!
All personnel in section ''D''... to vacate site immediately.
Proceed with all movable equipment... to rendezvous ''G.''
This is an emergency.
Repeat: This is an emergency.
Virgil, pull off!
Pull off!
Your thrusters are throwing it off balance.
F.A.B.
Base and Thunderbird 2... we need to decide a course of action but fast.
As far as l can see... any attempt to get near that ship... is going to bring a disaster.
The turbulence from our motors alone... will be enough to tip it off balance.
Have you any ideas, Dad?
All personnel and vehicles to proceed to rendezvous ''G'' immediately.
This is an emergency.
Repeat: This is an emergency.
We need a solution,
Gordon, and quick.
As far as l can tell... the only way we're going to get them off that tower... in one piece is to get a vehicle on that top deck.
Nothing we've got would be any good, Dad.
Our machines are too heavy. l know. l know.
We need something light,
Iow air speed... high maneuverability, short landing distance.
Say, l've got the answer, Dad! lt's crazy, but it could work.
Hey, what's going on?
Thunderbird 2 is leaving.
Don't tell me they've given up.
That's right, Mr. Tracy.
We've got it aboard
Thunderbird 2... and they just left.
We did all the necessary checks and fueled it. l certainly hope it works. lt's just got to work.
It's just got to.
The top of the tower is crumbling. l'm going to attach a line... to the front of the ship to see if l can hold it steady.
F.A.B.
What the heck are they doing?
Why don't they come in and get us off this thing?
You saw what happened when they came in close.
Well, what are they going to do? lf you let me call them, l can find out.
Oh, no, you don't! l'm not falling into that little trap.
OH, Dad. Line secured. l think it's going to help.
Thunderbird 1, from Thunderbird 2.
One mile from you. l'm landed on a grassy stretch down below.
Well done, Virg.
That was a quick trip.
Yeah, well, you see... l've got a Tiger in my tank.
OH, Brains, over to you.
Scott and Virgil... l'm going to circle the ship... and then attempt a landing.
OH, Brains. lf you make it, the order of evacuation... will be first, Tin Tin, second, Penelope... then the crew, and finally,
Parker and Alan.
F.A.B.
Right, Scott, l'm in position.
Brains is on his way up. l'm going to fix a line to this end.
OH, Virg.
Still no radio contact with Skyship 1. l just don't understand it.
Something must be wrong.
We'll soon find out.
Attaching line.
Don't tell me they're going to try a rescue with that thing.
They must've got it from a museum.
You're dead right,
Mr. Foster.
But l'll tell you something.
It's a brilliant idea. l think it's the only chance we've got.
Lane, Get over on the other side of the deck.
Get ready to welcome our guest.
Right.
Brains!
Scott, that was a close one.
Are you OH, Brains?
OH. Climbing for second attempt.
Brains, you're not going to make it.
As soon as you touch down, l'll open up with my jets.
The slipstream should slow you down.
Right. Let's try it.
F.A.B.
Penelope and Alan, in a few moments... l'm going to open up my jet engines.
Hold tight to that rail.
Alan, raise your hand if you've understood me.
OH, folks, hold tight!
Well done, Brains.
OH. Tin Tin, you're first.
Jump aboard.
Oh, no, you don't.
Get out of that cockpit and move!
Scott, one of the stewards has got Brains at gunpoint.
Now we know why there's been no radio communication.
What're they going to do, Virg?
Looks as if Penelope is boarding the aircraft.
And the Captain's getting into the rear cockpit.
OH. Turn this crate around.
What's happened to Brains?
Everyone's moving towards the Tiger.
There's no doubt about it.
The crew is in control of the situation.
Things look bad, Dad.
Guys, hold it a minute.
Come on! Hurry it up!
Get back fast! This thing's going to collapse any moment!
What makes you think l'm coming back?
Double-crosser!
We've got to stop him!
Quick! Jump aboard!
Come on!
We're going to crash!
We're just overloaded.
That's all.
Watch out for trees!
Penelope, throttle back.
Thunderbird to base.
Father, we're not going to be able to hold her much longer.
How's the evacuation... of the rocket site progressing?
Nearly complete... but they want about another 5 minutes.
Do everything you can, Scott... to prevent that ship falling.
Penelope, throttle back.
We're down!
Where's the throttle?
Down on the left hand side.
Throttle back.
Penny, throttle back.
Penny, that's the wrong way.
Alan, it's jammed. l can't move it.
Alan, l can't free it.
What shall l do?
Get her nose up! Quickly!
Don't panic.
Alan, there's another bridge ahead.
Pull...up!
Pull the stick back.
Pull it back! Penelope...
Hold the rudder steady,
Penelope.
Alan, obstruction ahead.
Alan!
Alan!
This is it!
All personnel and vehicles... should by now be clear of sectors ''A'' to ''Q.''
Danger imminent. l repeat: Danger imminent.
Thunderbird 1?
Loud and clear.
Scott, l just received the OH from the missile base.
Evacuation has been completed.
You can let her go.
Right.
Did you hear that, Virgil? l heard.
OH. Release cables on 5 second countdown.
F.A.B.
Zero! l want to get into the rear cockpit, Penelope.
But first, we've got to get rid of Foster.
Hold tight, Tin Tin.
Hold tight, Tin Tin.
OH, Alan.
Hold tight, Brains.
OH, Penny, push the stick over to the left.
OH. Heep us steady, Penny. l'm getting into the rear cockpit now.
Alan, l've only just realized
Parker isn't with us.
We must've left him aboard the airship. lt's too late now, Penny.
Anyway, a few moments from now... we may be sharing the same fate.
That's our engine gone, Penny.
Hold tight.
Hold tight, Tin Tin. l'm putting her down.
OH, Alan.
Hold tight, Brains.
Emergency landing.
Good luck, Alan.
Hey, Tin Tin! l still say, Alan, that was a fantastic landing.
Well, if it hadn't been for Parker... we could've said we'd got away with it.
Are you sure there was no chance of him surviving... when Skyship 1 crashed?
Not a chance, Alan. l suppose it must be shock... but a few moments ago, l'm sure l heard... a distant voice calling, ''Milady.''
That's funny. l thought l heard it, too.
Milady!
Milady!
And now, it gives me great pleasure... to introduce to you all... my new vehicle--
Thunderbird 6.
Thunderbird 6? l don't get it.
Oh. l know what you're going to say, Mr. Tracy.
That you haven't approved the plans... how could it have been built anyway... et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
But, nevertheless, l present to you...
Thunderbird 6.
Built, tested, and approved.
This is
Thunderbird control.
Launch Thunderbird 6.
Brains! Ha ha.
Well, l'll be a...
Look at that.
Brains, you old son of a gun. l'll buy it. l agree it's a good design.
It has been built... and it sure has been tested.
ALL MONSTERS ATTACK
Out of the way!
- Minya sounds like that.
- Minya?
Minya makes a sound like that car.
You're living.
I don't think he sounds like that.
It may not be that exactly, but it's like that.
Son, are you going home now?
Oh, father!
I've got to work late!
Be good until mother gets home!
Okay.
I'll be good!
What is it?
I found a radio tube.
You can't keep that!
Put it back!
Hey!
We're going to have to work a little later.
Hey, are you having any trouble with your kid?
What do you mean?
He just seems to be awfully quiet.
It's normal.
Really?
Well, it's hard to understand kids today.
We have to take a step back.
Everyone is so hard at work that we forget about the kids, huh?
Do you know of a solution?
I'll give up this life when i save enough money and move us out of the city, whenever that will be.
Get a load of this!
They found the getaway car of the crooks who stole •50.000.000 by the trains!
If it was by the trains, those crooks could have boarded them and be anywhere by now.
•50.000.000 yen...?
Hey, let's go play in that building for a while.
We shouldn't.
That building is closed.
I know how to get in there!
But... we could get in trouble.
There's no one in there.
All of the kids play here.
You were to wait for your mom...
We shouldn't.
Hey, let's go home!
We'll be alright!
Ichiro, it's Gabara!
Hurry, let's get out of here!
Sachiko, what are you doing there?
Oh, mother!
You know you shouldn't be playing around here.
Ichiro, you should hurry home.
Your mother will be worried.
Goodbye!
Hey, Ichiro!
I bet you stole that radio tube!
You're wrong!
I found it over there!
- Liar!
- It's true!
You can't find anything good there!
- Well, i...
- Give it here!
He did it!
But, i really found it over there!
If that's so, then go over and honk the horn on that guy's motorcycle.
That man is working!
He won't do it because he's scared!
Do it if you want this back!
I won't!
You're a chicken! Nyah, nyah!
You're a chicken! Nyah, nyah!
All units, the two fugitives wanted for the theft of
•50.000.000 from the bank are still at large.
Report to headquarters for new assignment, over.
This is car 11-5, roger.
Ichiro, are you heading home?
Oh, Ichiro.
You'll find the key in it's usual place.
What's that?
This?
It's a new toy.
I call it a TV computer.
- A TV computer?
- Yes.
What does this computer do?
Can it do things like homework?
It stores data.
But, hey... let me show you.
Just push this button and...
"Kids, the moon is 1/50th the size of our world. "
How about it?
Would you like to learn more about the moon?
What do you think?
The moon is a neat place, but there's another place that i'd rather visit.
Where is that?
Monster Island.
Monster Island?
Minya lives there, along with Godzilla,
Rodan and Kumonga.
All of them live there.
And they all beat up on Gabara.
Gabara?
What monster is named that?
He's someone that always wants to fight.
Oh, you mean that kid in school you call Gabara.
Was he picking on you again?
Today, he took away a radio tube i found.
Why don't you stand up to him?
I would, but he'll knock me down.
If he knocks you down, you just get back up and try again.
But, it's hard when you're small like me.
Yoichi, it would be great it you could put all of the monster sounds in here.
See you later!
I see.
All of the monster cries, huh?
What monster's voice was that just now?
It was mine!
What?
Is that all?
"Ichiro, do your homework before you play. "
"I left some cake in the cupboard.
I'll fix dinner when i get home. "
"Mother. "
With the signing of the world treaty, it now goes to the United States
Congress for ratification.
And now for some local news.
Police are still looking for the two men who robbed •50.000.000 from a bank.
Today, they were inspired by the clues left behind.
The criminals abandoned their getaway car in an alley, and police believe they may still be in the area.
The police will conduct door-to-door searches in order to track them down.
Ichiro, i don't understand what's happened between us!
I can not stay with you any longer.
Can you try to forget about me?
- I will only bring you sadness.
- Ichiro!
Computer, computer... take me to Monster Island.
Computer, computer... please tell me all you know about Monster Island.
Computer, go ahead.
What?
Oh, the antenna.
Where is Monster Island?
Computer, go ahead.
Yes? Yes?
We're going by jet?
We're taking a jet out of
Haneda Airport?
Ladies and gentleman, thank you for riding with us on
Pan-Am Airlines.
We will arrive at Monster Island on schedule.
Monster Island,
Monster Island this is Monster 1-5.
We are ready to make our final approach.
It' Godzilla... and Kamakuras!
Gorosaurus!
Manda!
Angilas!
It's Oowashi!
It's Kamakuras!
Alright!
Minya!
Come over here.
I won't do anything to hurt you.
Really?
You don't need to be afraid of me.
Thank you for helping me out.
Why did you come to
Monster Island?
I wanted to meet all of you.
Won't you father and mother be worried?
They're never around when i get home from school.
It's Gabara!
Gabara?
Let's go!
Is that Gabara?
It is.
He's very bad.
Do you ever fight?
I can't.
He's too strong for me.
Well, i'm the same way.
- What do you mean?
- We both have our own Gabara!
Mother!
Yes?
This is toy consultant Inami.
Is this Ichiro's mother?
Yes.
I hate to be a bother, but would you mind looking after Ichiro a while?
It's alright.
He just fell asleep a little while ago.
What's the matter?
I'll be home tonight, but an associate is out sick and i'm filling in for her.
I'm very sorry about this.
Thank you for doing it.
- It's the police.
- What's going on?
Hey, you know those crooks who stole •50.000.000?
The police think could be in this neighborhood.
Oh, my!
Hey, wake up.
Hey, it's time to wake up.
Where am i?
Where did i go? Where?
Hey, hey, you're right where you were when you fell asleep.
Oh, no.
Why didn't you let me stay asleep?
Why would i do that?
I was just about to be introduced to
Godzilla by a very special friend.
Who?
By Minya.
Minya and i have become good friends.
Hey, hey!
Don't you go back to sleep on me!
I just got a phone call from your mother.
She won't be able to make it home tonight.
Really?
Again?
They always do this to me!
Relax! Relax!
Your mother and father work hard to make ends meet.
I got it!
Why don't you eat with me tonight?
Is that okay?
Hey, you'll be okay!
Well, come over to my place for dinner.
Minya, come get me.
Minya, come get me.
Minya, come get me.
It's no use.
Oh, no.
Hey, Ichiro!
Come here!
Come here!
- Ichiro's a coward!
- What a chicken!
Is nobody in here?
I'm right!
Gabara may have taken my other radio tube, but he won't get hold of these.
I should have guessed Gabara would come here.
Over there!
Headphones!
I finally found them!
Quiet!
Stupid idiot!
How could you do such a thing?!
What did i do?
When you looked down this hole, you driver's license fell out of your pocket and the kid has it!
Get down!
Hey, follow that kid home and get your license back!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't do that, you'll break it!
It's already broken.
It's okay for now, but if you break anything more... i'll never be able to sell it anytime soon.
I have my own driver's license.
Hey, hey, hey!
Why don't you take your toy license elsewhere?
Monster Island, Monster Island.
Monster Island, go ahead.
Monster Island, go ahead.
Mister!
You're interested in this car, right?
Well, i...
It looks old on the outside, but is runs good.
Would you like to speak to the owner?
Oh, this isn't you car?
Well, it's not, but i'm in charge of it.
How about it?
Let me show it to you.
- No... maybe later!
- Hey, hey!
What a cheapskate!
- Hey, Ichiro! Dinner time!
- Right!
Hey, what's the matter?
You haven't bad any meat!
I would... but it's not right.
What do you mean?
I don't want you to go bankrupt.
I won't go bankrupt over sukiyaki!
Did you sell your toy?
I think i did.
And for that, i'll make you my monitor.
Monitor?
I make a new toy, and as a child you can test it to see if you like it or not.
Well, can i monitor the sukiyaki too?
That's right.
Let's eat!
Hey, hey!
Gobbling you food like that is bad for you!
You won't be able to sleep!
Oh, that's right!
If you find that i'm asleep, don't wake me.
I'll be visiting Godzilla.
Godzilla?
Where is he at?
On Monster Island.
Minya is going to introduce me to him.
We're sorry to intrude on you.
What is it?
We're with the police.
We need to ask you some questions.
The car for sale outside, is it yours?
It is... but, isn't alright to have it out there?
No, no... that's not the problem.
Do you know of the criminals that stole •50.000.000 recently?
They may be looking for a car, and we wanted you to be sure to lock it securely.
Really?
Well, thank you for telling me.
Thank you.
We'll be on our way.
Let's go.
Thief! Thief!
Get away! Get away!
Thank you.
What do we do now?
I don't know how much longer i can stay here.
I'm hungry!
Hey, it wouldn't hurt to get some curry.
Hold it.
You held out longer last month when we were west of here.
I sure hope you can lead us back to where that kid lives.
I found him on the second floor of an apartment complex.
Alright.
Hey! Don't go to sleep!
Let's go finish this.
Hey!
Minya!
Gabara!
I did it!
Hi!
What?
It's you!
What are you doing?
I don't have any friends to play with.
Well, it's the same with me.
What brought you back here?
Well... i was hoping that you would introduce me to Godzilla.
Really?
I wonder where he is now?
You don't know where he is?
- I don't think he's very happy with me.
- Why?
Godzilla feels i should fight my own battles and start creating my own legends.
Wow, he's strict!
Oh, there he is!
Let's go!
Horray!
Horray!
Good luck! Good luck!
Go get him! Good luck!
Back up.
Back up.
Will Godzilla be alright under water?
He'll be alright.
He's very strong.
He did it!
He did it!
Godzilla is back on land.
Let's follow him.
Kumonga!
Godzilla's eve was hurt!
Alright!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Get going!
Get going!
Your breath isn't that strong yet, huh?
Well, Godzilla's just about to use his, and it sure is powerful!
Wow, that's great!
Look at that!
Godzilla is on the ground!
He did it! He did it! He did it!
What's the matter?
It's Gabara!
What is he doing?
Is he attacking?
Hey, let's get away!
But... Godzilla won't be very pleased with me if i run away again!
You can't do it!
Alright!
Minya, good luck!
Good luck!
Go get him!
Minya, run away!
Run away!
Okay, let's get out of here!
It's okay now.
I was cheering you on, but it's not enough against him.
Those are jet fighters.
The humans in them attack us whenever they pass over the island.
Hooray!
Hooray!
No, no, no, no...
I guess humans aren't the only ones who have to study...
That was great, Minya!
Stop squirming!
If you don't stop.
I'll use this! I'll use this!
Hey, see if it's clear.
Ichiro!
Hey, Kid!
What's the big idea stealing this?
- It's alright now, go get us a car!
- Right!
You're going to behave, okay?
Be quiet!
Stop your crying!
What kind of young man are you?
I'm a young man that's scared!
You just keep quiet!
- I'll take a bowl!
- Yes, sir!
Hello.
We meet again.
Are you still working this late?
It's been pretty hopeless so far.
Then you haven't found any leads in the investigation?
We've gone through this area, but the clues have been very scare.
I figured we would look around a little longer.
Hey, would •50.000.000 fill a bag?
Sure.
It would fill a bag about this big.
Damn!
What's taking him so long to get a car?
Just ignore me. Just ignore me.
Just ignore me.
Just ignore me.
Just ignore me.
- Minya. It's Minya.
- What?
You better watch out for Minya.
There's nothing to look out for here!
Minya... Minya... Minya... Minya...
Minya... Minya... Minya... Minya...
Minya! Hang in there!
I know you can do it!
That's it!
Minya!
This way!
Come up here!
Minya!
Hurry up!
I have an idea!
Hurry! Hurry!
This will work! When Gabara steps on that end of the tree, you jump on this end!
What will happen then?
It will send him flying!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Alright!
Let's do it!
Now!
You did it!
Godzilla, get him!
He did it! He did it!
He did it! He did it!
I knew Godzilla was the greatest!
Gabara's a chicken!
Gabara's a chicken!
Don't do it!
I'm on your side!
Stay back!
Somebody, help me!
- Help me! Help me! Help me!
- Hey! You're having a nightmare!
- Help me! Help me!
- Wake up! Hey! Wake up!
Keep quiet!
It's me!
It's me!
Stupid idiot!
What took you so long?!
Give me a break!
The tire was punctured!
The spare wasn't very good, either!
- I don't think that this...
- Do you have the car?!
The car is ready for us outside.
Your hankerchief...
Your hankerchief!
Are we taking the kid?
I'm not too keen on kidnapping.
Not his legs!
His hands!
We won't kill the kid.
We'll just take him with us.
He's going to be our insurance.
Sort of like a safety net, huh?
Grab the bag and let's get going!
Right...
- Hey, i...
- Hurry up!
Sit still!
Hurry up!
Damn, not another delay!
We have to hurry up!
Hey... you stay put, okay?
What's the matter?
Idiot!
Let me do it!
Whatever you're doing, hurry!
Godzilla feels i should fight my own battles and start creating my own legends.
Let me go!
Let me go!
You brat!
Stop!
Keep quiet!
Damn!
He's in here.
Let's get him and head for the car.
Hey, you check those rooms and see if he's in there.
Idiot!
Be careful, you idiot!
What do you expect me to do?
I'm not some animal that can see in the dark!
That's enough!
Come on!
- Hey, did you find him?
- No.
Damn!
- Where could he have gone?!
- He's not here.
Hey, you go down and watch the entrance.
I'll go check the second floor again.
Damn brat!
What's the matter?
- He's on the third floor.
- Good.
Hmm... this car looks kind of familiar.
Where have i seen it?
This is my car!
If this is my car, why is it out here?
This is strange...
What's this?
It isn't mine.
The thieves!
Well... i looked in my car and found a bag!
Yes, a bag!
I'm sure i didn't imagine it!
Damn!
You think you can get away?
Hey!
I found him! Hurry!
What happened?!
- Where are you?
- I... i'm here!
- But where is that?
- I'm below you!
You stupid idiot!
- Damn!
- What happened?
It's not broken.
Hey, where can i find him?
Up there!
Why didn't you tell me sooner?!
There he is!
Hold it!
Hold it, you brat!
Bastard!
Hey, stop!
Stop it!
Wait!
Here it is!
This is it.
- Uncle!
- It's Ichiro!
- Ichiro!
- Uncle! Uncle!
Get back!
Put your hands up!
- Drop the knife!
- Hurry up!
Hey!
Come here!
Put your hands in the air!
Come out here now!
- I'm sorry!
- Yeah, right!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Those two... Ichiro, did you catch them on your own?
Yes, i did.
It's all right... it's all right...
You did it, huh?
Good job.
- Go ahead.
- Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry.
You mother had to work again last night.
I won't do it again.
But... it's so we can live better, right?
Oh, my!
You and dad work any time you have to.
I'll be alright.
Breakfast was good!
- See you later!
- See you later! Be careful!
Boy, you faced the thieves on your own?
I wasn't alone.
Huh?
You weren't alone?
Who else helped you?
Hey, who helped you through the ordeal?
It was Minya.
Minya?
- See you later!
- Hey, Kid! Boy!
It's alright!
It's Minya... the monster.
I think i understand.
I think he believes that his ideas came from Minya.
- Believes...?
- Yes.
In a man's world, we have our god.
In a child's world, it's not difficult to view Minya as a divine guide.
Sachiko!
Did you tell your story to the reporters?
I want to see it when it's done.
Hey, Ichiro.
Will you join my gang?
No!
What?!
You're no good, Gabara!
I hate you!
Why you...!
I won't be bullied!
I hate you!
Stop that!
What are you doing?!
You shouldn't play with that!
Stop that...!
He did it!
Let's go!
Stop!
Hey! Hey!
Stop!
Father!
- Father!
- Yes, son?
Dad, do a favor?
Can you hold up that man?
- Huh? What's the matter?
- I made him angry!
- Huh?
- Hey! You! Stop!
You can't get away!
- Get going!
- Thank you, dad!
Hey!
Hey!
Wait!
I'm sorry.
What appears to be the problem?
- What kind of question is that?!
- Hey, what happened?
I've got paint all over me because of that kid!
- I didn't do a thing to him!
- I'm sure he didn't mean it.
Hey, Ichiro!
Mister, i'm sorry!
THE END
Who is the most self-reliant animal
made since the world began?
Who can be the most defiant animal
known to the world of man?
born with emerald eyes
so cold, so warm, so wise
within her kingdom lies
the world's arena
do we need to ask more than that?
you must know now it's a cat
but a very important cat at that
who's called...
Thomasina!
Thomasina
what are you thinking now?
Thomasina
what makes you so highbrow?
for I do think it very odd
if you are an Egyptian God
that the wee, little mouse
runs in and out his house
each time you blink or nod
Thomasina
though you may love to roam
Thomasina
don't go too far from home
there are beasties in the garden
who would never accept your pardon
if you left the jungle yard in
which we play
Thomasina
don't ever run away
Thomasina
come along with me now
Thomasina
though you've seen a
little bird leave the bough
Thomasina
even if it's a lark or dove, you
let them all fly away above you
but I guess I'll always love you
anyhow
Thomasina
come along with me now
Thomasina
I love you anyhow
Thomasi...
Yes, I am Thomasina.
This story's all about me.
I'm a self-made cat,
And here's the house
I live in
With the Macdhui family,
Whom I'd adopted when they first came here.
They started off by calling me Thomas,
But when they, well, got to know me better,
They changed that to Thomasina.
Humans are funny that way.
That the Macdhuis are a happy family
Is entirely due to me.
I made them what they are today...
Although I had to be murdered first.
Here's the scene of the crime -
Inveranoch, in Scotland,
In 1912.
And this is Mr. Andrew Macdhui.
From a cat's point of view, even before my murder,
He was a most difficult man,
Believe me.
His wife had died sometime before he came here,
So there was just himself
And Mrs. Mackenzie, his housekeeper,
And Mary, his daughter.
I'd moved in on them a few days after they'd arrived,
And on the whole,
I got on with them very well,
Though mostly because of Mary Macdhui.
She appreciated my rather special qualities
From the start.
Thomasina, there you are.
Of course I had this sort of thing
To put up with every day -
Fussed over, treated like a doll,
Being dressed up...
And over a fur coat, too!
Everything that happened to me from here on
Was due, in a way,
To a blind man and his dog.
Here they are now -
Tammas and Bruce.
Good morning,
Tammas.
Good morning, Mary.
Say good morning to Tammas and Bruce, Thomasina.
Good morning, Thomasina.
She's not in a very talkative mood today.
I have the same trouble with Bruce here.
He can be very reserved at times.
Isn't that right, laddie?
But what would we do without them, you and me?
Where are you going?
Oh, just to get some tobacco for my pipe.
Mind how you go, Tammas.
Och, Bruce is my eyes, lassie.
Come on, say goodbye to Thomasina.
Be good now, Mary.
Thomasina, it's rude not to answer
When you're spoken to.
Aah!
Hello, Geordie.
Oh, what have you got there?
I found him down by the loch.
I think his leg's broken.
He can't hop or swim or anything.
Oh, he looks fair sick.
Doesn't he, Thomasina?
Ah! Don't touch.
Why don't you go and ask my daddy to cure him?
Och, I don't know.
Do you think he would?
My daddy can cure anything -
Dogs and cows and cats and lions and pigs and...
Aye, but frogs?
And frogs.
Everything.
You take him in, then.
Och, I'm not allowed in the surgery.
You go, Geordie.
Well, if you say so.
I'm only saying I'm here against my better judgment, minister, that's all.
You'll be glad you listened to me, Dobbie.
Mr. Macdhui's a clever man.
Maybe so, but up till now,
I've never found much wrong with dosing Jock here
With Watson’s patent powders.
Ah, you must move with the times, man.
Macdhui's a man of science.
Aye. I Haven't heard tell much good of that.
Ha! Book learnin'.
Up at Kinkairale's farm, they're grateful enough to him.
Two hundred sheep cured of the foot rot
And not one lost.
Aye, you're a good persuader,
Mr. Peddie,
But farm beasts are one thing.
A man's pet is another.
You wait and see.
Och, I'll give him a try.
No one can say
I'm not a fair man,
But it's for him to convince me.
How old is this dog,
Mrs. Laggan?
Fifteen years and a bit.
I've had him since he was a puppy,
The year my husband died.
He's been ailing a wee bit this past year
But not so sick as this.
Well, he's very old.
The kindest thing would be to have him put to sleep.
Oh, no. You see how bad he is with the asthma.
The poor dog can hardly breathe.
He's in pain, Mrs. Laggan.
But you can't put Rabbie to sleep, Mr. Macdhui,
Or I wouldn't have come.
He's all I have in the world.
Couldn't you give him a wee bit of medicine
To tide him over till he's well again?
There is no medicine that can make him well.
He's very old, he's in great pain,
And his life is a misery to him, can't you see?
But I can't lose him.
What would I do without him?
Poor Rabbie.
Be fair now. It's yourself you're pitying, not the dog.
Oh, dear.
I don't know what to do.
I've told you what I think is for the best.
Now I've told you it's up to you
To make up your mind.
Very well.
I suppose if he is suffering...
You'll be gentle with him?
He won't feel a thing.
He'll just go to sleep.
Willie?
Fifteen years.
Poor Rabbie.
Poor Rabbie.
You're doing the right thing.
It's for his sake.
Oh, no, there'll be no charge.
Just leave him here with me.
You're leaving Rabbie to be cured, then, Annie?
Mr. Macdhui says there's no cure.
He's to be put away.
now, Mrs. Laggan, that's a shame.
No cure for him?
If it was my dog, I'd want a second opinion, I'm thinkin'.
I'll go with you, Annie.
Good day to you,
Mr. Macdhui.
Good day, sir.
Good day.
Who's next, please?
Please, sir, Mr. Macdhui?
Uh-oh. Who are you?
Geordie Macnab, please, sir.
I'm a bit of a friend of Mary's.
I found him down by the loch.
He's hurt his leg.
Can you make him better, please, sir?
No one can cure a hurt frog, Geordie.
You put him back where you found him.
But he might die.
Could you not mend his leg, please, sir?
No, nature's the only doctor can do that, laddie.
Come on, now.
Come on, off you go.
I'm busy.
You've lost another customer, Andrew.
Is there really nothing you can do
About old Mrs. Laggan's dog?
No, not a thing, just put it out of its misery.
Well, whoever's next,
Will you come in, please?
Oh, it's all right,
Mrs. Campbell.
You go in ahead of me.
I'm in no hurry.
hey, there's Geordie.
What have you been doing in there?
I took my sick frog to Mr. Macdhui.
Oh, aye.
What did he say, then?
He wouldn't even look at him,
And he's going to kill
Mrs. Laggan's Rabbie.
Kill him? Rabbie?
Aye, I heard him say so.
It's just like grandfather says about him -
He's only good with farm beasts.
He's not interested in people's pets.
A frog Will die if he can't hop or swim.
I'm not going to let him die.
What are you gonna do, then,
Cure him by magic or something?
Come on, Jamie.
Why don't you take your frog
To the witch woman livin' in the Glen?
She's supposed to do magic.
Well, why don't you?
Our mother says the witch woman's crazy
And we're not to go up there.
Och, you're just afraid, the pair of you.
I'm not afraid of anything, and neither is Geordie.
Are you, Geordie?
Right. Let's take the frog to her, all three of us.
I dare you.
Very well.
Geordie, we'll all go.
You want to get your frog cured, don't you?
We don't have to tell mother we went.
I was only joking.
No, you weren't.
You dared us.
I think you're afraid to go.
Me, afraid?
Let's go now.
Come on.
Keep up with us.
You'd think they were all telling on us.
Aye. Are you afraid to go on, then?
No.
Well, come on.
Whisht! Listen.
It's the witch singing and banging a drum.
She is crazy.
I want to go home.
When you've got this far?
What about your frog?
Put your box under the tree and ring the bell.
Aye, go on, Geordie.
We'll wait for you here.
No, no! Go on, Geordie. Go on.
Come on, Geordie.
Go away. Go away.
Go away. Go away.
Larry, come back here.
Oh, your leg is broken.
You poor wee thing.
Has somebody brought you up here to be cured
By the mad witch in the Glen?
Eye of newt and hair of dog,
Give me the power to cure the frog.
listen. Magic.
Off to my cauldron.
Where is my broom?
Och, you poor wee thing.
I don't know why
I bother
To dose that dog of yours.
The worst thing that's wrong with him is his owner.
Don't give him sugar.
Aw, but he has a sweet tooth, Andrew.
Poor old Finn.
Look how pleased he is.
You think more of his affection and gratitude for you
Than you do of his health.
All you people with pets are the same.
That's why he's too fat, poor brute.
"brute," he calls you, Finn.
Oh! That's part of the reason
Why folks here are slow to accept your doctoring.
You show no feeling for the sick animals you treat,
The animals they love.
Are sentimental about, you mean, to the point of not knowing
What's best for them, like you and
Mrs. Laggan who was here just now.
Poor old Annie.
Poor old Annie.
Poor old brute of a dog, you should say.
You thought I was hard on her just now, didn't you?
My job is to relieve suffering in animals.
The tribulations of the soul
I leave to you.
She'll get over it, angus.
Aye, but when someone you love dies,
Something of yourself dies, too.
You think you have to tell me that?
Oh, I'm sorry, Andrew.
Forgive me.
That dog of hers was all old
Annie Laggan had left to love.
At least you're not alone.
No.
Look at her now.
Thomasina, where are you?
Thomasina?
Be careful.
It's the jungle.
It's a million Miles thick.
It's full of lions and tigers.
Thomasina!
Thomasina, come back!
Have you lost something, Mary?
Shh! We're hunting lions.
Lions? Here?
Geordie, where's your frog?
Did daddy cure him?
No, he wouldn't try.
We took it to the witch in the Glen.
You didn't. I did. We all did.
You saw her?
Is she a real witch?
Aye, we saw her chant magic over the frog
And take it into her house.
Did you speak to her?
Och, no. She's queer in the head.
She's got a big drum in the house.
She bangs on it and sings awful weird.
There's all kinds of animals there.
Did she fly on a broomstick?
Well, not exactly fly.
But she had one, though.
Weren't you afraid?
Well, I wouldn't recommend just anybody goin' up there.
You were afraid.
You made Geordie take the frog to the tree.
That was you.
I wasn't afraid.
You must be awful brave.
I am... A bit.
Uh... Remember, angus,
Just keep him off the sugar.
Well, I can try.
Hello, Mary.
Geordie Macnab took his frog you wouldn't cure
To a witch who does magic and flies on a broomstick.
She could have turned him into a frog,
And it would have been all your fault.
Mary, Mr. Andrew,
I'm waiting for you.
Come on, now, inside.
Wash your hands.
Thomasina!
Never mind Thomasina.
Dinnertime!
Come on, now, inside.
Wash your hands.
There's a good girl.
That's enough about witches.
Mrs. Mackenzie Will tell you the same as me -
There aren't any outside of storybooks.
Oh, yes, there are.
She been making up more of her fairy tales?
I didn't make it up. There is a witch in the Glen.
Och, the Glen.
She bangs a big drum in her house.
And lives with wild animals and rides a broomstick.
Jamie Macnab told me.
He and Hughie and Geordie saw her.
They're filling your head with nonsense.
And for the hundredth time, Will you not feed that cat at the table?
Especially with meat.
She likes meat, and there is a witch.
Now, Mary...
It's a poor wee soul called Lori Macgregor
That's rented a croft in the Glen from Mr. Peddie.
She spends most of her time weaving on a handloom.
That's the "drums" your friends heard.
Now what do you say?
She's a witch.
She's a wee bit weird, that's true enough.
It seems she's a lassie
That doesn't mix with other folk,
But, mind, she's not been there long.
Some of the shepherds in the Glen say
She has a rare way with beasts and birds and that.
Now, mind Thomasina doesn't spill her cream.
Cream?
Oh, just a wee drop,
Mr. Andrew.
It helps her to see in the dark.
She told me so.
Didn't you, Thomasina?
There, you hear?
Ask her if she'd like me to go out and get my rod and catch her a salmon.
Thomasina...
She says, no,
She'd rather go to the store on market day
And choose her own fish.
Aye.
Come on, now, no more talk about witches or magic.
Just say your prayers, get into bed.
And look after mummy in Heaven and us down here,
Especially daddy and Mrs. Mackenzie
And Willie and Geordie and Jamie and Hughie and Tammas and Bruce
And Geordie's frog and Thomasina and me.
That's all till tomorrow.
Yours truly, Mary. Amen.
Good night, yours truly Mary.
Slippers?
Up. In you get.
There we are.
Good night.
Good night, daddy.
Thomasina.
I've told you about that before, my bonny.
You mustn't keep that cat on the bed at night.
There.
Oh, please let me have her.
No, you can have your doll if you like.
I don't want my doll.
Please.
She must go out and you must go to sleep.
Go on, lie down.
There's a good girl.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night, Thomasina.
You know.
Yes, I knew,
And Macdhui didn't.
This being put out for the night
Was just nonsense.
I could get in again anytime I wanted to.
Mary and I had it all worked out.
It was as easy as that.
Thomasina.
Thomasina, come on up.
But not tonight.
I'd remembered it was Wednesday,
The night before market day.
They set up the stalls at dawn,
So Wednesday's always my night out.
And just when I was beginning to feel like breakfast,
The market was getting ready to provide it.
Fish, fresh fish,
And the best sauce for it -
The danger of helping myself...
...Which needed cunning and caution,
A lot of caution...
And speed!
You, get out of the way!
Get out!
Mary?
Mary, come and have your breakfast.
What's the child doing?
Mary!
I can't find Thomasina.
I've looked everywhere.
She can't be far away.
Come on, now, sit down.
She didn't come home last night.
For what we're about to receive,
May the lord make us truly thankful.
Amen.
I'm not hungry.
Daddy, she must be lost.
Of course not.
Cats don't get lost once they've decided to move in on people.
She's just had a night out and hasn't come back yet, that's all.
She's been out all night before,
But she's always come back.
She climbs up the tree and gets in my window.
What?
She always has.
It's our secret.
Aye, it certainly is.
Well, I'm off to the surgery now.
Be a good girl.
Eat your breakfast.
Don't worry about the pussy, child.
But she's lost.
Thomasina's too clever to get lost.
You do like her, don't you?
Aye, of course.
Would you do anything for her if I asked you to?
Promise?
Aye.
Well, let me go and look for her now, please.
You promised.
You're even craftier than
Thomasina, you wee monkey.
We'll split up.
Mary, you come with me.
Hey, what are you lookin' for, son?
A lost cat.
Have you seen one?
Not at my stall. Away you go. Go on. I'm busy.
She's a big... Mrs.
Macfarland, what would you like?
Nice cabbage.
Have you seen a lost cat?
Thank you very much.
Drat the cat!
Och, it's not Thomasina.
But never mind.
We'll find her.
Hughie, Mary,
I've found her!
She's here, Mary!
Oh, Thomasina.
Give her to me.
I don't think anything's broken,
But she's terribly stiff.
Oh, poor Thomasina.
I couldn't help it, constable.
He walked right in front of me.
it looks like Bruce.
Bruce? My Bruce?
What's all this about?
Och, Mr. Macdhui.
You're just here in time.
It's Tammas' Bruce.
Where is he?
Steady now, Tammas.
Steady.
He's fair crushed, sir.
I couldn't help it,
Mr. Macdhui.
Better get him back to the surgery - quick.
Bruce is my eyes,
Mr. Macdhui.
Can you save him? I'll do what
I can. Stay with him, angus.
He's in good hands now, Tammas.
Now, come on, you come with me.
This is going to take a long time.
I hope his heart
Will stand it.
Are you ready?
The Spencer wells, Willie.
How is he, Willie?
He's doin' fine.
What are you children doing?
Mary, go away from here.
Daddy, it's Thomasina.
She's hurt.
Go away, child.
Please look at her.
She's awful sick.
Here, Willie, take this cat.
Daddy, daddy, please look at her. Please make her well.
Mary, you mustn't stay here.
Now, listen to me.
I've got blind Tammas' dog here. He's badly hurt.
Well, so is Thomasina.
If you only look at her!
All right, I'll look at her, but go away, all of you.
You'll make her well?
You promise?
Yes, I promise, but go on out.
Come on.
Out, all of you.
I think you better look at her, sir.
Not now, man.
We got work to do.
Mr. Macdhui, sir, look.
Quick, get her out of here, and that cloth she's laying on.
That cat has tetanus.
Get her out of here.
Deal with her, disinfect your hands and hurry back.
But, sir... Mr. Macdhui, you promised the child.
The cat is beyond help.
Will you do as I tell you?
Hurry up, man.
We've the dog to seal.
Aye, I Will.
I Will.
Nearly an hour already.
How much longer can it be?
Aye, the waiting is hard.
Well, Bruce Will live, Tammas.
He'll even walk again.
Thank God.
Take me to him.
Not now.
He's still unconscious.
But I'll send Willie round to fetch you this evening.
Bruce Will know you then.
And he'll get better?
Aye, be as good as new.
It's a great skill you have, Mr. Macdhui,
And no one can deny it.
There now, what did I tell you?
Come on, Tammas,
I'll take you home.
God bless you,
Mr. Macdhui.
God bless you.
His pulse rate's fine.
I'll stay with him till he wakes.
Aye, he'll do.
I never thought to see such a surgery as that.
Aye, and what you have to do now
Will be just as hard,
I'm thinking.
You have to tell the child about her cat.
"the shoeblack tries his bread to earn
"and would an honest penny turn.
"when mud upon our boots leave stains,
"his ready help good payment gains.
The beefeater we see today... "
Daddy, Thomasina - is she better?
She's out of pain, Mary.
What was wrong with her?
Let me go to her.
She is better, isn't she?
Mary, uh, now,
Will you listen?
Listen to me just a minute.
You see, there are some things
That you have to learn to face,
Even if at first they seem a bit unfair.
Where is she?
Thomasina's wound was poisoned,
And she might have made other people's pets ill, even die.
But you did save her?
I- I couldn't, Mary.
I couldn't.
See, there are some things your daddy can do and some things he can't.
What did you do to her?
I, uh, had her put to sleep.
There was nothing else
I could do.
Now, try to understand, Mary.
No! No! You said you'd make her better.
You promised! You promised! Come on, Mary...
I'll never speak to you again! Mary, please...
He promised, and he's killed Thomasina!
She's dead!
I'll go up to her.
Aye.
And take everything she was wearing when she found the cat.
Everything, do you hear?
And burn what you can't boil.
I didn't realize she was going to take it so hard.
Could you not have saved the cat?
It was wounded, infected with tetanus.
I did what was right.
I'll get her another cat.
Can't I?
Well? Can't I?
Well, I'll buy her anything she wants.
Why did she take it so hard?
For a clever man,
You've an awful lot to learn.
Don't be so sad.
You'll do yourself harm.
Look, I tell you what we'll do.
We'll give Thomasina the best funeral any cat ever had, won't we?
Aye, with a full service and everything.
My mother's got just the right box
That'd do fine for a casket.
We could pick some flowers and have a procession,
Like when Old Dougal was buried.
Everyone in the village would see us.
Aye, you'll wear widow's mournings
And walk behind the casket, weeping.
And Annie here, she can be chief mourner.
I can cry awful loud, Mary.
not now.
Will I wear a hat and a black coat?
Mrs. Mackenzie has one.
Aye, we'll all dress up and get everyone to come.
I know! Jamie's just learning the pipes.
He's not very good... I can play Macktintosh's lament!
I'll wear my dress kilt with my skean dhu and sporran,
And everyone in the street Will say,
"there goes the poor widow Macdhui,
"a-burying of her dear Thomasina,
Foully done to death,
God rest her soul. "
Will they? Really?
Aye. It'll be a great, great procession.
You'll see.
We'll go and get Thomasina now!
Aye, come on.
I opened my eyes,
And where was I?
They say that to die
Is a Journey from light into darkness,
But here was light again.
This was no quiet endless sleep.
I was flying,
Flying wildly,
Without weight or effort,
Diving, spinning,
Falling backward and downward
Into the mists of time,
Where my ancestors were worshipped
In the temples to bast
Thousands of years ago.
Bast, the cat goddess,
The goddess with the golden eyes
Staring and staring,
Drawing me upward and upward
And upward and upward.
Then there were flowers,
Flowers everywhere,
All around me, touching me,
And the sound of music
Wild enough to wake the dead.
playing
"mackintosh's lament")
Lord sakes,
What are the children a- burying today?
Mary Macdhui's cat
Thomasina.
My grandson Hughie told me
Her father couldna be bothered to cure its sickness.
His own daughter's pet.
Ah, well, maybe he was busy at the time,
You know, what wi' Tammas' dog,
And after all, it's a blind man's eyes.
His own daughter's pet.
It's hard to understand.
Right.
This is far enough.
Put it here.
Now get some stones and build a cairn for the grave.
Now get the coffin off
And put it down just there, you two.
Come on, hurry.
Now get some stones.
Come on, get some stones.
That'll do fine.
Now, let's get on with the service.
I'm going to take the service.
It was my idea.
No, you're not.
I'm the oldest, and I've come prepared.
Brethren, friends, and fellow mourners...
och! Go on, then.
We have come here today
To bury Thomasina and to praise her.
She was the friend of Mary
Macdhui here, who you all know.
Uh, eh, well, anyway, there she is.
Shh! Not yet.
Hold your noise.
Thomasina was one of the best cats in all Argyllshire,
And we all feel for her best friend and owner.
Whisht!
Not yet, not yet.
There is no doubt that Thomasina was a terrific mouser, too.
She had a few faults, aye,
But I won't mention them here.
Uh, and her mortal remains
Will now be laid to rest.
Now!
playing "the Bonny Banks
O' Loch Lomond")
by yon bonny banks and by yon bonny braes
where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond
where me and my true love
Will never meet again
on the bonny, bonny banks of Loch Lomond
oh, ye'll tak' the high road and I'll tak' the...
It's mad Lori.
and I'll be in Scotland afore...
It's the witch!
She's coming for us.
Run for it!
Run quickly!
She's a witch!
Run for it!
The witch!
The witch!
What were they doing?
Your heart's still beating.
Oh, poor thing.
Didn't they know?
You come with me.
Mary, come on in and get your supper.
Hello, Mary.
What have you been doing all afternoon?
Mary, your father's speaking to you.
Mrs. Mackenzie,
I've seen the witch
That lives up in the Glen.
What?
We all ran away from her...
Hughie and Geordie and
Jamie and Jock and Annie.
What's this nonsense now?
And what were you doing in the Glen?
And she is a witch.
I've seen her.
So there.
Mary, the... The kittens that
Mr. Peddie's cat Amanda had
Are now ready to leave their mother.
Would you like to come and choose one for yourself?
Mary!
Would you like to come
To Mr. Peddie's with me tomorrow
And choose a kitten?
Jamie Macnab can play
"mackintosh's lament" on the pipes
With only nine mistakes.
Answer me, Mary.
Answer your father, child.
But he's not very good at "Loch Lomond. "
This is ridiculous.
If this is her way of sulking just because...
Don't you want your supper?
No, I do not.
Now who's sulking?
Tell miss Macdhui if she does want a kitten, she'll have to come and ask me.
Everybody was real scared when they saw the witch, except me.
I wasn't.
I just looked at her and said,
"I'm not afraid of you. "
Oh, give me strength.
Oh, you and your stories.
Eat your supper.
Now you've made your father angry.
No, I Haven't.
My father's dead.
by yon bonny banks
and by yon bonny braes
when the Moon...
bright on Loch Lomond
Don't cry, child.
I Haven't seen you cry for a long, long time.
Look, Mary, I'm sorry about Thomasina.
I've told you.
I'll get you another cat,
Or maybe a wee dog to be all your very own.
Wouldn't you like that?
Now, look, child, I can't bring Thomasina back to life.
What's done is done!
Oh, very well.
Good night, then.
Oh, granddad, don't keep on about it so.
That cat's funeral was nothing but a children's game.
Not to some of us.
I'm tellin' you...
I've said it before and I'm saying it now -
That Mr. Macdhui is doing no good here.
Now, don't interrupt me, woman.
He's a townsman, not a highlander.
He has no feeling for animals at all.
Oh, come now, granddad.
Some of the farmers round...
The farmers?
Did you not hear that he made an order
To destroy the whole herd of Ian Macclennen's cattle
Because one cow was sick?
That's the law. They had foot-and-mouth disease.
It wasna the law in my day,
And it was only Macdhui's opinion that they had it.
and look at his record.
Never mind the cattle.
Annie Laggan's old dog Rabbie
- he had him killed.
He saved blind Tammas'
Bruce, though.
Oh, aye, that was because everybody was there watching.
That was just showin' off.
Now, granddad, you shouldn't say that.
Well, the man that did what he did...
And he wouldna even take the trouble
To treat his own daughter's cat when it was sick...
Is no better than a murderer.
It'd be a good thing if he went away.
I'd make it too hot for him here,
I'm telling you, if I was younger.
So would others.
Him and his newfangled science.
Mary!
Mary Macdhui!
Are you coming out to play?
Mary!
She won't be comin' out today. She's in mourning.
And anyway, we've got work to do.
What work?
Forming an anti-Macdhui society
To drive him out of Inveranoch.
Och, listen to him.
My grandpa said he's no better than a murderer.
Your grandpa?
And he told me Mr. Macdhui
Had two whole herds of cows slaughtered
Because he thought one beast was sick.
People are saying he ought to go, and I think we ought to join them.
And what does blind Tammas say about him?
Och, he's only one.
Now, here's what we'll do.
Me and you, Geordie...
Morning,
Mrs. Macleod.
Morning.
You're not thinking of taking your cat to Mr. Macdhui, are you?
Why not? Och, he won't bother with it.
He doesn't care for anybody's pets.
What?
He'll just say,
"can't be cured,"
And then kill it.
Get away wi' you.
It's true. He even did it to his own daughter's cat.
And Mrs. Laggan's dog.
He killed them.
I did hear about Rabbie, but he was awful old.
That cat of yours is younger than Mary's Thomasina.
You take him in there,
And he'll just get his bottle of chloroform and...
Just a minute, Harry.
Listen.
We were just telling Mrs. Macleod,
Mr. Wallis, about Mr. Macdhui.
You'd be well advised not to take your dog in there.
I'm thinkin' of rebuilding my pigsties.
You know, I've had two outbreaks of swine fever up to now.
Have you spoken to this new vet here... Uh, Macdhui?
Not yet.
Is he any good?
One of Mr. Macclennen's cows had foot-and-mouth disease,
And Mr. Macdhui had two whole herds killed.
That young Annie of mine
Took my best black shawl from my closet yesterday
And tore it into ribbons in some game.
Aye, I saw them playing at funerals,
Burying young
Mary Macdhui's cat.
Mr. Macdhui killed it.
Killed it?
Aye, the same as he did
Mrs. Laggan's dog.
He kills things.
He saved Tammas' Bruce, laddie.
Aye, because everybody was there watching.
That was showin' off.
He's an animal murderer.
You tell me he killed his daughter's cat?
He didn't like it,
So he took his gun and killed it.
His gun? Well!
Och! Isn't that awful?
Well, now, Andrew.
Glad I saw you.
I wanted a word with you about Mary.
I did what you said, asked her to come round
And choose one of your kittens,
But she'd have none of it, or me, either.
It's like speaking with a blank wall.
To a child of her age, feeling is stronger than reason.
You know that, Andrew.
Aye, and grief is usually forgotten quickly, too,
But the death of this cat, it's like an obsession with her.
Well, she's something of a loner child.
Forgive me.
She has no mother, and she needs someone to love.
She has me.
I'd do anything for her.
No child's ever been loved so much. Unselfishly?
What do you mean?
Tell me the truth, Andrew.
Were you maybe a wee bit jealous
Of that cat of hers?
The truth, now.
The animal had to be destroyed.
It would have died anyway.
You can take my word for that.
Angus, would you do me a favor? Do you think you could have a talk with her?
You might be able to reason with her.
Well, I can try.
I wish you would.
She's at home now.
You ought to be out playing in the sunshine
And not moping here indoors.
Geordie Macnab and Hughie came asking for you.
Why don't you go and look for them?
Oh, Mr. Peddie,
Mr. Andrew's not in.
I was just passing by,
Mrs. Mackenzie,
And I thought
I'd pay a call on Mary.
Would she be at home, do you think?
I'm here, Mr. Peddie.
Well, now, there you are.
You were so quiet,
I didn't see you.
It's fair warm outdoors.
You're wise to stay inside.
Would you mind if I sit down and rest a while?
Here?
Ooh, I think the stairs are a grand place
When you want to have a good think.
You know, I was thinking just now about your Thomasina.
What with my own cats,
I get all mixed up remembering what yours was like.
Thomasina, now, he was about...
She.
Oh, aye, she, yes.
Thomasina.
She was about, what...
So long?
And did she not have a wee square blaze on her chest?
No, it was round.
Round? Aye!
Now you remind me.
It was round, aye.
But she did have three little white feet, didn't she?
No white feet at all.
No? Oh.
But she had a pink nose
With two black specks on it.
I remember that well.
No specks.
No specks?
Do you remember
How she'd sit and look at you sometimes
With just the tip of her tongue showing?
When she was waiting to be fed.
Yes, when she was waiting to be fed.
You see, Mary,
Thomasina isn't dead at all,
Not really dead,
Not when we can remember her together like this,
Because she's alive in our minds. No!
And as long as you can remember her like this, she'll never die.
Just call her to your mind, and she'll come,
Even if you were to have another wee cat to love.
You know, I was saying to your daddy just this morning...
My daddy's dead.
I killed him.
Did you, Mary?
How?
I killed him.
I put him in a box with flowers in it.
We all took him out into the Glen and had a funeral,
And now I Haven't anybody at all.
Mary...
No! I like being alone!
Good day to you, Birnie.
I'm here to look at the bull.
I've let him out.
He's in the paddock.
Oh, right. I'll find him.
No need to, Mr. Macdhui.
He'll do very well.
Just tell me how much your fees are.
What's all this about?
I'll be no more needing a veterinary.
If there's anything wrong with my beasts,
I'll take them to the woman in the Glen.
She's a rare way with them and charges nothing, I'm told.
Is that where you're takin' the cow?
Aye, my man is.
What's wrong with her?
She's dried.
You have as much chance of getting pints of beer as milk
Listening to that rubbish.
I thought you were becoming enlightened, Birnie.
What I do with my beasts is no concern of yourself, Mr. Macdhui.
This cow has no disease reportable under the acts of the county.
Your bull didn't, either.
Aye, I didn't know then what sort of a vet you were -
Putting beasts to death whenever it suits you.
What?
Aye, my stockman heard it from his son at school in Inveranoch -
The dogs and cats you've no use for,
Even your own child's pet.
I see.
So you believe that,
And you're going back to the witchcraft and the superstition.
You said times change.
Well, maybe they're changing back again, Mr. Macdhui.
The old remedies are as good as book learning, sir.
Good day to you.
Apart from Mary,
I've another headache now.
The whole village seems to be boycotting me and spreading tales
About what a heartless monster I am.
Och, a few children.
It's having its effect.
In a few days, the people have forgotten
That the blind man's dog is alive because of me,
But they remember the few creatures that I had to have destroyed.
Be patient with them, Andrew. Patient?
Tell me something.
What do you know about a half-witted woman named, uh...
...Named Lori who pretends to be a witch?
Well, I rented her the croft she's living in.
I know that.
That's why I'm asking you.
And she's not half-witted, nor does she pretend to be a witch.
She's been labeled that, just as you say you've been labeled a monster,
Only she doesn't mind, because she wants to be left alone.
Well, she's not succeeding.
At least two farmers that I'd won round to scientific treatment
Are taking their beasts to her.
Aye, I hear she has a remarkable skill with animals.
What skill?
Without real knowledge, you can do great harm.
Would you take a sick child to a quack doctor?
Some people have natural gifts, Andrew,
And Lori Macgregor has the rare quality of mercy.
Since you know her so well, perhaps you'd tell her
To stop undermining the progress that
I'm trying to bring to these people here.
Why don't you tell her,
Andrew,
And tell me afterwards what you make of her.
Aye. Aye, I Will, one day,
And put a stop to her interference with my work.
Time passed,
And I began to see and feel again.
I couldn't remember any part of my first life,
Although something told me
I'd lived before,
That I was still me.
I'd heard that a cat has nine lives.
I accepted the fact, so...
This was my second life,
My life with a girl named Lori.
She was gentle and kind,
I'll give her that,
But she didn't seem to realize -
And neither did the other creatures around me
- how important I was.
There we are.
All of you -
Dorcas, Mack,
Molly,
Whisker - be nice to Thomasina now.
"be nice," she said,
But none of the others paid any attention to me at all.
They weren't really my kind anyway.
Thomasina, dear,
Go and walk in the sun now you're able.
There are others here who are not.
I wasn't important anymore,
Treated just like everybody else.
Now I knew how a king feels in exile.
Hughie, Jamie, quick!
what is it?
Come and see quick.
A badger.
He's been in the trap a long time,
And he's badly hurt.
What'll we do with him?
If we try and take the trap off, he'll only bite.
We could wrap him up in a sack, trap and all,
And take him to the village, to the vet.
To Mr. Macdhui?
We can't do that.
We're trying to get rid of him.
What else, then?
Couldn't we take the badger to the witch?
She's nearer.
Aye, that's true.
She couldn't cure a mess like that with magic.
I bet she could.
Mr. Macdhui would only kill it,
So let's wrap him up and take him to the witch.
Jamie, get the things.
I'll get the sack.
Careful now.
You've got him?
Aye, got him.
Seeing and hearing these boys gave me that
"I've been here before" feeling.
You know what I mean?
I knew them, and yet I didn't.
They made me feel uneasy somehow,
So I kept an eye on them.
Well, who's gonna take him to her, then?
You. You're the eldest, you're always telling us.
Aye, but - but it was Geordie's idea.
He's too big for Geordie to carry,
But if you're afraid...
I'm not afraid of anything.
Well, go on, then.
Put him by the tree and ring that bell.
Oh, poor thing.
Poor thing.
Oh, God, please, God, help me.
Wait!
Don't touch it.
But it's hurt, from that.
Cursed gin traps.
Look what it's done to...
Mind yourself.
Drop it. It'll tear your throat out.
It'll not harm me. No creature harms me. They're not afraid.
Put it down. You're mad. Aye, so I hear.
Get away from it.
Let me go. Let me go!
I'm sorry, but a wounded badger could half kill you.
No creature ever harms me. Don't touch him!
Leave him to me.
To you?
Why, who are you?
My name is Macdhui. I'm the veterinary from Inveranoch.
You are?
Now I see.
What do you mean?
You have the skill that I Haven't,
The skill that I prayed for when I found the badger.
Don't you see? You're meant to help him, and you must.
It's no use, I tell you.
It's too late.
Be kinder to put him out of his pain.
And wonderful to give him his life.
You have the skill for it.
Please, for pity's sake.
Don't go!
I've got to get my instruments.
They're in my car.
God, you sent him.
Please make him hurry back.
Well, that's it.
We'll have to see how it takes.
Still, they're hardy creatures with great vitality.
He has a chance.
Bless you and thank you for giving it the hance.
He'll have to stay quiet until the wounds heal.
Have you got a place where you can keep him?
Yes.
All right.
Are all these wild things in your care?
Yes, they come here to me.
Some instinct or guardian
Angel brings them.
And what kind of treatment do you give them?
Food, warmth, comfort and love.
And let nature take its course,
And that mends them.
And what about the other beasts that are brought to you?
Farmer Birnie's cow, for instance.
I know all about that.
What did you do for her?
I sent her back to him with a message for him to be kinder to her.
Ha. Like to seen his face.
And this?
I found him one morning by the tree outside in a box.
He had a broken leg, but he's better now.
Well, I can describe his guardian Angel to you.
He's about six years old, red hair, and his name is Geordie Macnab.
Well, keep your eye on the badger, Miss Macgregor,
And see that he doesn't tear off the dressing.
Aye, I'll watch him.
You know, um, in Inveranoch,
They, uh, they call you "witch,"
And if you can get all these creatures here to live together in peace,
Perhaps there's some truth in it.
The truth is that they have security
Because they've no fear.
Animals are not like people.
They only fight and kill when they're hungry or afraid,
Not for gain or to prove how strong they are.
You don't have to be a witch to understand that.
What made you come here,
Mr. Macdhui?
Well, I-I thought that, uh...
It's no matter now.
I must go.
I've work to do.
Wait. I must pay you for the work you've done.
Um, there's no need.
Will you take this, then, from me?
I made it here.
Then I'm glad to have it.
Thank you.
I knew the man...
And yet I didn't know him.
He reminded me of someone,
Something that was missing in my present life.
What do you think he's done?
Killed it.
But the witch wouldn't let him.
He wouldn't be likely to help her with magic, now, would he?
Suppose we had a look through the window.
It's our badger.
We're responsible for him.
Aye. Maybe if we were careful...
Come on, Geordie.
If she catches us,
You can say you came to see how your frog was getting on.
You want to know, don't you?
Come on, then.
Psst!
the badger's in here.
I think he's dead.
I told you Mr. Macdhui would kill him.
Here, Geordie, you're the smallest.
Climb up and have a look.
He's not dead.
I can see him breathing.
are you sure?
Look out!
ow!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Och! It's all right.
What's the matter?
What are you afraid of?
Let me go!
You're the one who brought the frog to me.
He's better now.
His leg has mended.
Do you want him back?
Then come and see him.
He's not very strong at hopping yet,
But he can swim all right.
He's going in with her.
She must have put a spell on him.
Here's your wee frog.
Look.
Oh, he's better.
Did you do it with magic?
With a powerful magic,
Geordie.
You know my name.
Cor!
Was it you who brought the wounded badger, too?
Is he going to be all right, please?
Did you do magic with him?
No, that was Mr. Macdhui.
What he did was magic.
Mr. Macdhui - does he do magic?
He has a wonderful skill that's almost magic.
He saved the badger's life.
Can I go now?
Don't you want to take your frog?
Thank you for curing my frog.
I'm not afraid anymore.
Well, not much, that is,
But I have to go now.
are you all right?
Yes. Look, she cured the frog.
But what about the badger? She cured him, too.
She put a spell on Mr. Macdhui and made him help her.
She's an awful good witch.
Hello, Mary.
Do you know what I did today?
Went up to the Glen to see your witch.
You know, she's not a witch at all.
She, uh... Isn't even what Mrs.
Mack calls, uh, "something weird. "
She's a bit like yourself -
Wants to be left alone.
Except that she's, uh,
She's got all kinds of creatures up there with her -
Squirrels and rabbits, stray dogs, cats,
Uh, wild birds
And a -
And a badger.
If I go up there again,
Would you like to come with me and see him?
Look, Mary,
I brought you a present.
look.
Something of your very own.
Och, I couldn't get nowhere with her.
She shows no signs of wearying of this game she's playing, that I'm not there.
And how do you play it,
Andrew?
Talk to her, behave as if everything was normal between us,
Read stories to her, but she pays no heed.
And that wee dog you got for her?
She'd have none of it.
I had to take it away again.
No, she won't forgive me, because I failed her.
At least, that's the way she sees it.
I think the trouble lies deeper than that.
You were the only human focus for her love.
That's why her shock of disappointment in you was so great.
Andrew, have you ever thought of getting married again?
No.
You need another focus for your love
Besides the child, and Mary needs a mother.
It's too late for me to fall in love again.
Oh... So you've seen
Lori Macgregor.
Aye, I've seen her.
What do you make of her?
Don't know.
She, uh, she has a-a strange way with her,
A strange skill that's instinctive.
I don't understand how she lives out there, cut off, alone,
And yet doesn't seem to be alone.
You should see her again, Andrew.
Maybe she could teach you that rare virtue.
You're in need of it, my friend, great need of it.
Good night, angus.
Hello, Miss Macgregor.
So he came to see Lori,
But putting a stop to what she was doing
Soon went out of his mind,
And he kept on coming to see her.
I've learned a great deal watching you.
If only I had the skill you have.
But you've a way of taking the fear out of these wild creatures,
Making them trust you, that I wish I had.
But I'm a witch, remember?
Aye, you must be.
You cast some kind of a spell on them.
I love them all.
When they're lost or strayed or alone in pain,
That's what they need.
I feel for them.
And you, with all your skill - do you?
I give them what I have, my knowledge of what to do.
I do my job.
Is that all it is to you?
You must have chosen to become a veterinary.
No, my-my father was one himself.
He chose it for me,
And he was a man that you didn't cross.
No, all my life,
I wanted to be a doctor,
Dreamed of it and worked for it.
You must have put a spell on me to make me tell you that.
Except for my wife,
I've never told another soul.
Only she knew.
"knew"?
Aye, she's dead now, about five years ago.
You say you believe in providence and in God's mercy,
And you wonder why I don't?
How can you not?
I loved my wife.
She did nothing but good.
She went out nursing the sick in an epidemic,
Caught the sickness herself, and died.
"the Will of God is inscrutable," they told me.
"God is love," they told me.
Which is true.
That's what she believed,
Yet the God who's supposed to be love allowed her to die.
And therefore you reject him?
Because your love died, his love has no truth?
Is that what you mean?
Ask yourself that when you've known pain.
I saw both my parents drown,
Andrew, in a storm at sea,
But my Faith didn't die with them,
And they wouldn't have wished it. I know that.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Forgive?
I'm glad you told me of yourself
And I told you.
Aye.
I'm glad, too.
I must go now.
The man's coming back gave me that feeling once again
Of there having been some other time,
Some other place...
And one night it came to a head.
It was as if something was pulling me,
Drawing me on
And on and on.
I knew the way somehow,
Although I didn't know why or where I was going.
Thomasina.
Thomasina!
Thomasina! Thomasina!
Come back!
Thomasina!
Thomasina!
Thomasina!
Thomasina!
Mary!
Mary!
Thomasina!
Thomasina.
Thomasina.
No, no!
Let me go! I saw her!
I saw her! Let me go!
You were right to call me.
She's in bad shock.
Could turn to pneumonia.
I see signs of it now.
I've done all I can for the moment.
I'll be around first thing in the morning.
Thank you, Strathsay.
What should I do?
Keep taking her temperature every hour or so.
It's just over 100 now.
If it gets any higher, let me know at once.
I won't leave her. Show the doctor out, Mrs. Mack.
You better get out of those wet things. You'll catch cold.
I heard the shouting, saw the doctor arrive.
Glad you came, angus.
I'm worried sick.
If she should catch pneumonia...
Aye, that's a great battle
For a wee bairn to fight alone.
Pray for her, Andrew.
Pray for God's help and mercy.
Pray.
Yes, pray, because if ever there was a man
In need of mercy, it is you.
You know I'm not a one for praying,
For goin' down on my knees.
Well, pray on your feet, man.
It's what's in your heart and mind that matters,
Not whether you kneel or not,
Though that would be good for your soul.
It's this stubborn pride of yours
That has made you live inside yourself so long.
I've forgotten how to pray.
I can't do it.
I can't feel the need for it.
Humble yourself, Andrew.
Humble yourself.
If you love the child,
Pray for her.
Oh, Thomasina, where have you been?
I didn't know.
From the present back into the past,
To the present again,
Where I was safe,
Protected,
And loved.
Where are you boys going?
Further up the Glen, granny. Well, you're not to.
They say in the village there's a witch up here.
She'll put the evil eye on you.
make way!
yah!
Hah! Hah!
Right, you devil.
You'll pay for this.
Come on!
What's he gonna do to the horse?
Let's go and see.
Aye.
Darvas, put the bear to his paces
And wake him up.
come on, get out.
Get out. Go on. Go!
all right, get him out.
Get him out!
Down you come.
Down!
Come on.
Now this way. Up.
Up now.
Come on, up and dance.
Come on, up! Up!
Up and dance.
Come on, you blackguard.
Get up and dance now!
This one's worse than the other.
The bear can hardly walk, let alone dance.
What are you doing under there? Get 'em!
Come on, boys, get 'em!
One gettin' away.
The other one's...
Got him down.
All right!
Let him go!
Come back here, you.
Get back to work!
Mr. Macquarrie, sir, there's some gypsies in the Glen,
And you've got to do something about them.
They're beating horses, and there's half-starved dogs
And a poor bear with a sore foot. It's true!
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
One at a time. Now.
We were up there watching them.
They're beating their animals.
Oh, they're awful people, sir.
You've got to arrest them,
Mr. Macquarrie.
I've already told them to leave the district and move on.
I gave them until tomorrow while they rest their horses.
rest them? You should see what they're doing.
You bring me a complaint from the proper person, and I'll act on it.
I don't take orders from a lot of children.
What proper person?
The county officer concerned
With cruelty to beasts -
Mr. Macdhui.
Mr. Macdhui?
Uh-oh, what's this?
How's Mary, please, sir?
We're sorry that she's sick.
Aye, she's very sick.
We hope she'll get better soon.
We Haven't seen much of her sin...
Since the funeral of Thomasina.
But we really came to see you about another matter, sir.
what's that?
To report cruelty to animals.
There's some gypsies up in the Glen
With performing animals.
They're awful cruel.
They've got a bear with a sore foot,
And they make him dance!
Constable Macquarrie said that if you were to examine them
And report them to him, he could put a stop to it, sir.
But I thought that my opinion as an animal doctor
Was no good.
Somebody called Hughie Stirling has been saying so.
Would he be a friend of yours?
He's no friend of mine, sir.
Hughie Stirling's a bit of a fool, sir.
Everybody knows that.
would you do something about the circus animals?
Aye, I, uh,
I Will when I can.
Well, uh, run along now, all of you.
He won't do anything.
He wasn't even listening.
Yes, he was.
He said he'd go when he can.
He doesn't care about those animals.
Well, we can't do any more, can we?
Yes, we can. We've got to. Hey, Geordie.
We could tell the witch about it - Lori.
The witch?
Aye, why not?
You say you're not afraid of her.
You could tell her.
Me?
She'd maybe put a spell on those gypsies,
Turn that big one into a horse or a bear and learn for himself
What it's like to be badly treated.
I bet she'd do it.
Go and tell her, Geordie.
Go on. I dare you.
Why, Geordie, hello there.
I came to ask you something, please.
Will you come in, then?
It's better if I do.
I brought you a present if you'd like it.
It's because you cured my frog.
Oh, Geordie, you didn't have to do that.
How is your frog?
Och, he's fine.
This is my present.
I made it myself.
What a beautiful pipe rack.
Thank you, Geordie.
It's just what I need.
I thought you might.
I was - we were wondering
If you'd do something else with magic.
Another frog?
Och, no.
There's a gypsy circus down in the Glen
With all kinds of animals and a bear,
And the people are awful cruel to them,
Beating them and that, and they're half starved.
Have you told the police?
Aye, and Mr. Macdhui,
But they won't do anything about it.
Mr. Macdhui won't?
No, we asked him, and he said so.
We thought maybe you could put some magic
On the gypsies to stop them.
Would you, please?
The bear's got an awful sore foot.
I'll go and see what I can do, anyway, I promise you that.
I knew you would.
Oh, thank you.
I have to go now.
She's going to do it!
She's going to put a spell on the gypsies!
You cannot stay in here all day and night
Torturing yourself, man.
You've had no rest, no food.
Rest? What rest can I have?
Strathsay says she's no longer fighting.
It's as if she's lost the Will to live.
Where is Strathsay?
He said he'd be back by now.
He said the fever must run its course.
There's no crisis yet.
He's done what he can for Mary.
We're all of us praying for her.
Praying?
I humbled myself and prayed, too.
I'd crawl on my hands and knees if begging for her life would save it.
She's lost and hurt, angus.
I can make no contact with her.
I wonder...
Perhaps someone who has the gift
For hurt and lost creatures
Could unlock the child's mind.
You mean Lori Macgregor?
I do.
Then ask her.
Bring her here.
She's unlocked your mind enough to make you realize
You're not sufficient yourself.
Stay here with the child, Angus.
Lori?
Lori!
So one night the man came again...
Lori!
...But this time he looked helpless
And lost
And frightened.
music playing)
Now let's get the bear out.
We'll have him on next.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing in there?
She's the witch the women speak of.
Come on out, you!
If you're in charge here, you should be ashamed.
Your dogs are sick, these horses past work.
The bear is... You're breaking my heart.
All right, then, you dance, witch.
you do the bear's act for him.
Come on.
it's the witch.
no! Aah!
Let -
Let me go!
Let me go!
Andrew!
you dance for the bear.
Look at him!
Look at Mr. Macdhui!
Who's in charge here?
I am. King Targu.
What right have you to knock about my people?
What exactly were you doing?
Driving out the witch who set the evil eye upon us.
Evil eye? I've heard about the evil you do with these wretched beasts.
What do you want here?
I have the power to close down your show for cruelty to animals.
That's what I'm going to do.
You'll pay for this.
Get him, and the witch!
Behind your back,
Mr. Macdhui!
I'm not standing for this. Come on!
Get the boys out of here.
Keep clear of this.
ooh.
Form a water chain! Quick!
Lori, get those children out of here. Quick!
Macquarrie, take that man in charge for cruelty to animals.
Here, give a hand here!
Try to hold still.
The bleeding has stopped, but it's an awful deep cut you have there.
Lori, Will you listen to me?
I've told you I'll not till
I finish dressing this wound.
You should have gone down to
Inveranoch with the others,
To a doctor, and not come up here to me.
Stop! Listen to me, m...
I am listening, Andrew.
I'm a wee bit scared not to when you're so fierce.
I was afraid of you down there in the fightin',
And afraid for you.
I came up here looking for you,
Just like the other strays and the lost that come to you.
Why?
My daughter is sick with pneumonia,
And I need your help.
I want you to come to her with me.
To your house?
Please come.
Why me?
Well, you have a
- a kind of a magic for the hurt and the sick.
I've hurt the child so much that her sickness is the worse for it.
You have? How?
Well, she had a pet that she loved more than anything.
I had to have it destroyed.
I didn't realize how much it meant to the child,
But in-in doing what I did, I...
I betrayed her trust in me.
I killed something in her.
Lori, you prayed yourself once, didn't you?
And you said that my coming here
Could be the answer to the prayer. Aye, it was.
Well, I prayed, too, and your coming with me now could be the answer to that...
For me, for Mary.
Will you come, please?
So... He brought you.
What have you been doing, man,
To get in that state - brawling somewhere?
How is she?
The same.
What is this?
Mary?
Mary Macdhui.
Do you hear me?
Andrew, may I take her?
Do what you Will.
What does this woman think she's doing? Let her be.
Andrew, there's so little of her left.
When the man took Lori away and they left me alone,
I was frightened.
I had to be with somebody.
The feeling grew stronger
And stronger.
Suddenly, like the lightning flash that split the tree,
Everything -
My other lost life - came back to me.
I knew where I belonged.
I had to go home.
Home.
Home.
Home!
Thomasina!
Can't be.
It's my Thomasina.
Yours?
I found her sick and nursed her.
Is she hers?
Is that the pet?
Thomasina! Thomasina!
Lori, call her!
Make her come in.
No, you must.
She must come to you.
Thomasina.
Don't you see that if Thomasina
Is the love your child has lost,
Only you can give it back to her.
Call her. Make her come.
Thomasina.
Come to me.
For the love of God, come to me.
I knew him now...
Macdhui, my murderer...
And he needed me.
Without me, he was lost.
So this was my Chance,
The moment of truth for both of us.
Thomasina.
Come to me.
Yet, because of my second life with Lori...
Thomasina...
...Because of what
I'd learned from her,
I didn't want revenge.
I wanted to come home.
Mary.
Mary...
I brought Thomasina to you.
She's come back to life again.
No, it's not a ghost,
Not a dream.
It's Thomasina.
She's come back.
It's Thomasina.
She's alive again.
Aye.
She's alive again.
And you're alive again, too.
I'm alive again, too.
So, my third life began,
With all of us together.
Not now.
goodbye!
And, to coin a phrase,
We all lived happily ever after.

(Several voices speaking at same time)
(Narrator) They had talked arid argued for years,
trying they said, to find a way to prevent It,
but they failed.
No one can be sure who started it,
and really that is unimportant.
It did happen.
The Atomic War.
It was short,
lasted about 48 hours.
Within two weeks,
92% of the human race had perished
to bomb and radiation.
Those left, with their birth rate below 1.4 per union,
turned to robotic automation devices
to help them rebuild their cities
and maintain a high standard of living.
The first exploratory steps
In the development of electronic brains
had been taken prior to the Atomic War.
These early models were bulky
and required large buildings to house them.
But they merely needed refining.
One of the first steps
was the magnetic integrated neuron duplicator,
a device one one-hundredth of the size of a golf ball
which duplicated portions of the human nervous system
and carried out learning processes.
Automation was also well on Its way.
But these too, were cumbersome
and needed further development
before the two elements could be Joined
in the series R-1 robot.
This first robot was quite ungainly
and Its functions were limited.
But refinements came in rapid succession
and soon the R-20 was capable
of all the thought processes
and functions of a man.
However, humans found
It psychologically Impossible
to work side by side
with a machine that they had to converse with
and which, in most instances,
could out-think them.
Thus It was that Hollister Evans perfected the R-21,
the first humanoid robot.
This story concerns them, the Clickers,
as they were disparagingly referred to by some humans.
All right.
Let's see your assignment cards.
What are you Clickers doing out tonight?
We're on free time.
We're not obligated to answer.
As a member of the surveillance committee of the Order of Flesh and Blood,
I demand an answer.
We're going to the temple to be recharged.
I think I'll keep you here until your power runs out.
How'd you like that?
I'd have to report such interference to the police.
Release them.
Was that satisfactory, Cragis?
Well, the order just wants to keep them mindful of their status.
You overlooked one little thing, though.
What?
The robot that didn't talk had a forged card.
Forged?
Why he can be disassembled for that.
Let's pick them up.
Be patient.
Well, the temple is just around the corner and it's out of bounds for us.
He'll get away.
Well, they have to come out.
And if they're taking a chance using a forged card, they must be up to something that the Order of Flesh and Blood might be interested in.
I...
Oh, Miss.
Just a moment, Miss.
May I...
May I see your assignment card?
You certainly may not.
Your Order may get by with harassing the robots, but you'd better leave citizens alone.
I'm sorry Miss,
I just thought, well with so many robots about these...
I feel perfectly safe with robots.
We intend to see that you are.
A most attractive woman.
Most.
If those robots are being recharged, they'll be in there about an hour.
We'll wait.
What's keeping them?
The subject robot has not yet completed the transformation process in the duplicating lab.
Where did you get him?
We bought him new on the black market.
He has no name.
Unassigned, and unadapted.
And he has a forged assignment card.
Who arranged it?
The inspector in Factory Three.
He stole him off the assembly line, just prior to numbering.
Unfortunately, an inventory was taken and the inspector was caught.
That was unfortunate.
Mark should bring him up from duplicating any minute now.
The delay was unavoidable.
We were stopped by two members of the surveillance committee of the Order of Flesh and Blood and I was questioned.
Is the duplication satisfactory, Acto?
It has to be perfect.
The structure is excellent.
The pores should be larger.
And he needs a little more hair, thicker.
He needs a 1/8 inch mole behind the lobe of the left ear.
Report back to duplication immediately and have the corrections made.
You can still alter your decision if this is against your circuits.
My circuits are unoffended.
I suppose it takes courage to submit to a thalamic transplant.
As an unadapted R-34, he has no fear circuits.
Consequently, he doesn't need courage.
He will before long.
Raven's operation will convert him to a R-96 with all the emotions of a human.
Only four points less than human.
I wonder what it's like.
He will learn how to laugh, how to cry, be afraid and hate. is a real sacrifice.
With this one, we will have 16, ten males and six females.
At times, I think we should turn the entire program over to humans.
It really shouldn't be the responsibility of robots.
But humans aren't ready for it yet.
It's still illegal to improve a robot higher than an R-70.
That law was lobbied through by the Order of Flesh and Blood.
The Order is becoming more powerful every day.
They virtually dictate to the police.
There are always ultra-conservative pressure groups set against advancement.
But why?
Why?
It's not in the best interests of humans to hold back the development of robots.
They won't for long.
We're filling key positions of R-96's as fast as we get them.
I still have an occasional doubt.
You may withdraw if you're contra-circuited.
I'm unoffended.
Mark, you better go down and join the volunteer.
Hurry things along.
The human he replaces has already been out of circulation for four hours.
The less time a man is unaccounted for, the better.
According to the latest tabulations by the brain, by the first of next month, we will outnumber the humans.
Yes?
Dr. Raven?
Yes.
Ultima Thule.
Number?
Come in.
Sorry I didn't recognize you.
All Clickers look alike to me.
Thank you, doctor.
Certain of us prefer not to be called Clickers.
Peel off that sensor skin and you could watch the cogs turn and the gears mesh.
You trying to tell me you have feeling?
Certain of the higher calibers do.
I've been working on a sticky electronic reflex problem.
I just can't make this arm bend at the elbow and, and the fist clench.
What circuitry are you using?
Uh, 1.3 impulsion to the motor neuron and, uh, modulating 28 to the sensory neuron.
The calculations are right, but you have them reversed.
I sure hate to have a bunch of cogs and wheels show me up, but then you always do.
As soon as I clear this table,
We'll get to work.
All right you, take off that head covering.
Your lab did another excellent job.
He's an exact duplicate of that deceased human your Clicker pals brought in tonight.
What did you do with that body?
The usual.
Processed it and destroyed it.
Everything we need from it is right here.
Now, about the money.
10,000 credits.
You could be disassembled for having money that's not earmarked in your possession.
What do they pay you?
They pay me nothing.
Having no need for money,
I have no desire for it.
You have no desire for it.
I love it.
You should let me rewire you.
You don't know what you're missing.
No, thanks.
I'm satisfied as an R-58.
Where do you Clickers get those credits?
A man can have his memory taken for a year for giving wild money to a Clicker.
The committee only gives us the money, not its origin.
Perhaps we should hurry.
All right, you.
Face down, on the table.
Turn yourself off.
For how long?
Ten minutes will be plenty.
I never will get used to that artificial blood.
The lower types just tend to shut off their pain circuits when they get hurt.
The blood forces them to report for repair.
I wish it were some other color.
The copper tubing turns it green.
This may be our last transplant for a while.
Our supplier was caught.
I didn't see it on Telefax.
The Ministry of Information doesn't want it known that robots are dealing in robots.
It would only give the Flesh and Blooders something more to yell about.
They're a minority.
A loud minority.
Your supplier, will they take his identity?
His memory will be dispersed tomorrow.
What a waste.
Why don't they just kill him.
The effect of personal cessation is the same in either case.
They just leave a hollow shell walking around.
He can still perform his duties.
But he's without a past, without hope.
The dream gone.
Almost like being a robot, isn't it?
No offense.
I'm incapable of taking offense.
But why is it the more we become like men, the more some of them hate us for it?
Men hate what they fear.
You have perfect memory.
Infallible logic, you never tire, you're circuited against anger and violence.
And in your world, that leaves us pretty helpless.
We have to study for years to learn what you pick up by plugging into a brain for two hours.
We don't refer to the father-mother as a brain.
Your father-mother is an electronic computer.
Just a machine.
Your parents were machines.
It's just that they were engineered with flesh and bones.
Neither are ideal components.
You came off a production line.
I know who created me.
Hollister Evans and the Mark 47.
You have to accept your creator on faith.
Who created your creator?
Yours.
You see, we are brothers. aren't we?
I ought to no better than to argue with you Clickers.
Can't beat your logic.
Humans aren't allowed to set foot in the robot temple.
Yet we saw a man come out accompanied by a robot.
I want to know why?
Those guys from the brotherhood should be here by now.
I wonder what delayed them?
Watch it.
What are you self-appointed defenders of the human race up to now?
Why don't you beat it while you still have a beat to beat.
Ah, you have so much to say,
I think I'll take you in for questioning.
That's as good a way as any to get you rating, lowered.
I'm a captain of the Order and my professional rank is eight.
Eight?
Well, just stay out of trouble.
Are you threatening me?
Sorry, sir.
Good night, sir.
How are my other transplants doing?
Quite well.
Who was this man?
I only know he'd been drinking.
Probably killed in a brawl.
The Clickers that found him removed all of his identification.
Will the drinking have any affect upon the operation?
It'll be interesting to see.
What are you doing with these advanced models?
We send them out to intermingle with humans to find out why some of them despise us so much.
Then we can adjust and be accepted.
That's admirable, logical and a lie.
What are you using them for?
When is his interview time?
Same as the others.
From 4:00 to 5:00 a.m., he'll know he's an R-96 and give you any information he's gotten in the interim. other than that period of one hour, he'll think he's whoever that corpse was.
How often does he report to the father-mother for recharging?
Twice a year.
But he won't know it.
Make it once a year.
He won't last as long.
What's 20 or 30 years?
In 150 years, he's automatically renewed anyway.
Whatever you say.
Why don't you register this operation?
Because I'd just be forbidden to use it.
Everything registered goes into the master computer.
Then all you Clickers would have it.
I want to be necessary to you.
Hand me that large amber bottle.
Thank you.
This sealer is wonderful stuff.
For next several hours, he'll have only the most basic human instincts.
Might even be drunk for a while.
Then the thalamic circuit will filter in and he'll have a perfect, human memory.
He'll be whoever he was.
A man.
Capable of jealousy, hatred, deceit, murder.
Most, most interesting.
What is?
Why men, having such negative qualities, feel so superior to us.
Too bad it isn't as easy to take those negative qualities out of men as it is to put them into robots.
Open up the door it's flesh and blood.
Flesh and Blooders.
It's inevitable, we must accept it.
We've got to get out of here.
I'll turn him on.
He might be able to pass.
At least we can save him.
Open up the door it's flesh and blood.
We'll carry out our part of our bargain.
I suggest you eliminate yourself.
No, I can't.
You don't know what it is to die.
If you don't, they'll take your memory from you.
You were speaking of personality cessation.
I just can't take my own life.
Are you sure the committee will keep their part of the bargain?
I'm positive.
Open up the door It's Flesh and Bhoders.
You kill me.
You kill me.
You know I can't.
I'm contra-circuited.
Maybe he has enough human instinct by now to...
Kill me.
Kill me.
Accuse my sister of being in rapport with a Clicker,
I'll kill you all right.
We'll take that one and the Clicker with us.
Leave the body of the old man here.
And call the police.
Cragis, come here.
This one's a robot too.
You must be mistaken.
We opened up a gash in his head.
If that skull isn't metallic,
I'll take another course in metallurgy.
So a robot finally became violent.
There's no doubt that he killed the old man.
This is what we've been waiting for.
The government will have to listen to us.
This is something, isn't it?
Yes
It's something.
The Body of the Order of Flesh and Blood is born.
The blood works through the ages.
One moment please.
May I have quiet.
Since this is an emergency session, we will dispense with the formal rights.
Two and a half hours ago, members of our surveillance committee captured two robots at the laboratory of a Dr. Raven who had performed an illegal operation upon one of them.
We have suspected operations of this nature and have complained to authorities to no avail.
But this time, a specimen was taken.
Captain Cragis led the group in this action, so I'll turn the meeting over to him.
Hello men.
About 6:00 this evening, two robots were intercepted and questioned.
They were on free time and were released to go to their temple.
Approximately an hour later, one of the robots was observed leaving the temple with what was thought to be a man.
They were trailed to the address of Dr. Raven, when entry to the premises was eventually forced.
One of the robots was taken without incident.
The other, had hair, no serial number, fought us viciously, and killed Dr. Raven.
It's against the first tenet of the manual.
Ward.
Brothers, that which we greatly feared has come upon us.
The robots have circumvented the prime law.
They've tasted blood.
And there are millions of them.
This is catastrophe.
Not quite.
The large majority of the robots are series one though twenty, merely electronic machines.
The series 21 through 70, the humanoids, the ones we're concerned with eliminating represent only about 20% of a billion odd robots.
One of them killed.
What's happening to them?
They hold menial jobs that bring them in constant contact with us.
They're conditioned reflexes make them imitative.
So, they want to be a part of the race.
They don't feel this is in violation of the code, since they contend that we would be happier on that basis.
Is the murder of that doctor part of an overall plot a precipitant, or merely an isolated incident?
An accident?
If the Clickers thought his operation was making them more useful to us, they wouldn't kill him intentionally.
Then there's no rescission of the prime law.
They can't hurt us?
There's been only a miswiring.
We'd better make sure.
And we shall.
Fellow men, this is our opportunity.
The robots have made the big mistake.
They've killed.
When this news is released to Telefax and the danger's made known, the ministries will have to recognize our petition and have the robots disassembled.
The robots are machines.
They must be made to look like machines.
Dr. Moffitt, will you bring in the subject robot and give the findings?
You didn't turn it over to the police?
All in good time.
You know how lax the police are in enforcing laws concerning the robots.
We must have our own facts in this case.
Won't we get into trouble?
Probably a letter of reprimand.
The police won't touch us.
After all, the only crime that can be committed against a robot is vandalism.
Now get them in here.
Fellow men, I've analyzed the subject robot as thoroughly as time permitted.
He is a basic R-34 type, but certain alterations have elevated him to a mid 90 classification.
A mid 90?
But an R-100 would be one of us.
A perfect man.
As good as we are.
He'd be better.
He'd be perfect.
Which of us could match that?
How does he fall short?
About the only power he lacks is that of self-reproduction.
The highest type of improvement allowed by law is an R-70, and then in limited number.
What alternations were made?
I located and removed a small unit from the thalamic region at the base of the brain.
It seemed to be the source.
The source of what?
We can't be sure.
You see, all robots can see, hear and feel.
It's necessary to their function.
Naturally.
This one could taste and smell and what's even more interesting, he had a complete human memory.
Those refinements are useless to a robot.
Not entirely.
This one thought he was a man.
How could this be?
Mankind is a state of mind.
A man is no more or less than he thinks himself to be.
Are you saying the Clicker's a man?
Your remarks are deviational.
Not my remarks, your interpretation.
I'm merely projecting your train of thought.
Which I am quite capable of doing myself.
Brothers, please.
Let's behave like human beings.
Dr. Moffitt, what tests did you run on the unit?
Of course I've only had about two hours to work on the unit, but I tested it within the robot.
Removed it, and tested it in another robot with like results.
And what are your conclusions?
Nothing definite.
But you must have found something?
What?
A few surface effects that present only premises.
The unit is gray.
About the size and shape of an almond.
I don't know what it is.
I don't know how to go about finding out what it is.
I only know that when wired into the central circuits, the robot claimed to be an able bodied spaceman, second class named Kelly.
Tests show he was telling the truth.
When brought in, he was incoherent.
I'm afraid I damaged him in removing the unit.
Evidently, they found a way to transplant memory.
We checked him through the Bureau of identification.
There is, or was a spaceman named Kelly.
This robot's fingerprints and retinal patterns checked with those on file for the man.
Well, if they duplicated this Kelly, do you suppose they killed him?
No.
I think I can speak positive on that point.
The robot denied it when wired for absolute truth.
They found him dead.
Well, if the man was dead, how would he have a memory?
Memory consists of facts.
Facts can't be destroyed, they can only ceased to be used.
You say he was incoherent when he was brought in.
Yes, as though affected by psychosis or alcohol.
His memory seemed sketchy, disoriented.
How could this occur in a mid-90?
I think it was botched job.
Then we better find out if there are any good ones around.
How?
Test all childless marriages?
The way radioactivity has cut down on the birth rate, this would be impractical.
Physical exams.
Might not show up.
This robot even had a simulated heartbeat and respiration.
But why?
Why put this unnecessary functions in a robot?
He thought those actions were necessary for him to live.
Can't you see, this one thought he was a man.
When we convinced him he was a robot, he ceased to function and became that senseless hulk standing there.
Who owns the two robots?
The R-53 is owned by the Ministry of Education.
This one has no serial number.
He was bought on the black market by the robots themselves.
We caught the supplier and brought pressure to bare so the police arrested him.
The man is having his identity taken tomorrow.
Anything further to report, Dr. Moffitt?
The most appalling aspect is the discovery of this thalamic unit, if that's what it is.
We don't fully understand the function of the thalamus in our own bodies.
Unfortunately, that renegade doctor not only understood it, he synthesized it.
Fortunately, the secret died with him.
I want that unit completely analyzed.
Is there anything to be added?
This emergency session is hereby dispersed.
Report to your various committees and evaluate this most startling development.
Just a moment, Cragis.
I'd like a word with you.
Well is it urgent?
Most urgent.
Do you know an Esme Cragis Miles?
Well yes, she's my sister.
Residing at 4456 Urban Way?
What about her?
She, uh...
Was she hurt?
I wish I could say that was all.
Cragis, I have to tell you this.
Your sister is in rapport.
You're lying.
One of our agents ran across this evidence.
Due to your high position in the Order, he gave it directly to me instead of to the Internal
Affairs committee.
I can't believe she'd do it.
According to this paper, she turned in her analysis questionnaire three weeks ago.
They're usually rapportized within three days.
Then my sister's been in rapport with a Clicker for two and a half weeks.
I'm sorry, my boy.
I suggest you do what you can to see that this relationship is voided.
Naturally.
Certain of our ranks are jealous of your standing in the order.
Our plans have been leaking out.
This wouldn't look good.
I know.
I'll put a stop to it.
According to the report, she's taken an R-49.
They're expensive.
Where could she have gotten the money?
Until last year, she was resident with Stedford Miles.
When they signed a mutual release, the settlement was a large one.
She's an assistant editor at Telefax.
The rapport of someone in that position could be most damaging to the work of the order.
I'll see her tonight.
I'll see who it is Esme, dear.
Do come in, though we've never met,
I'd know that you were...
Out of the way, stinking Clicker.
I came to see my sister.
Cragis.
It's The Cragis.
Esme, what have you done?
Cragis, why did you come here?
To throw that Clicker out.
That would be a dramatic gesture.
You like dramatic gestures, don't you?
You won't throw him out because you can't.
You're answer is no?
My answer is go ahead and try.
Don't think I won't, he... he can't leave without your permission.
Affirmative.
You mean, no?
I mean, no.
Negative.
NO!
I won't have it.
I'm the head of the family.
And I'm all that's left.
Shall we take a vote?
Well, how can you do this to me?
A thing like this.
Are you really doing it out of spite and if so, why?
What have I done to earn your hatred?
I don't hate you.
I feel sorry for you.
Don't be trite.
Be an artist, be a musician, even be a poet, but express your freedom some other way.
You know how I've always felt about this sort of thing.
Do you know how I felt about it?
Did you ask me?
Did we discuss it?
No.
You had your business and I had mine.
You never asked my advice.
Why do you offer yours?
Esme, you have to understand.
Perhaps, do you really realize the danger?
Cragis, do you think I was better off with Miles?
Miles was a man.
A beast.
A filthy, stinking, drunken, insensitive beast.
Miles had his eccentricities, but he was still a man.
And that's so important.
Pax is more of a man than Miles or you could ever be.
I'll show you how much of a man he is. stripped of his sham, he's not very pretty is he?
There, that's how much of a man he is.
Thanks, Cragis, for proving my point.
Pax is much more of a man than you are.
He could never do to you what you've just done to him.
You'd better put some sealer on your arm, dear.
Crag is, you're a fool.
Do you suppose reorientation would help?
Help you or me?
I think it might make something of you if you're willing to try.
You know my position in the Order.
How do you suppose this makes me look?
I hadn't really considered it.
You understand what the brotherhood really does?
Perfectly.
You hold meetings, wear ridiculous clothes.
You tell each other how superior we are to the robots because you know we're not.
We are.
You're pitiful.
You aren't just charging windmills.
You're trying to hold back the ocean with a sponge.
Attacking Pax, the idea.
Well, that was stupid of me.
He turned off his pain circuits and you accomplished exactly nothing.
I, I don't see how you could do it.
Pax and I are in rapport.
We're in harmony.
He understands me perfectly.
He instinctively knows what I want.
I just think of something and it's done because he thinks of it at the same time.
There are no arguments.
He's dedicated to keeping me happy.
And I am happy.
You love that, that machine?
I love Pax.
And it doesn't make any difference to you that he could be doing the same thing for anyone else who bought him?
You're wrong.
If he'd been bought by someone else, he'd be in rapport with them.
I don't understand you, Cragis.
You're not supposed to.
Do you expect me to be friendly towards you?
If you want to be.
Well, I don't.
If you wanted to hurt me,
I'd like you to know that you have.
How?
By humiliating yourself.
You know I must consider your well being above anything else.
That makes me feel better.
Good
Can't you see they're killing us with consideration?
Spoiling us into atrophy.
What would father have thought about this?
Oh, you're thinking of Pax as a person, aren't you?
Of course not.
Then why do you wait till he's out of the room before you say something that might embarrass him?
You know he can't take offense.
I just don't like to talk around those things.
Afraid of their logic? stick to the subject.
What would father have thought about this?
You should know.
You inherited all of his prejudices.
Oh, what a Flesh and Blooder he would have made.
Uniforms, boots, little silver knives to rattle. stop it!
Father was against everything.
Space travel, atomic energy, synthetic foods.
Remember how he loved to tell about storming the weather control stations.
I didn't agree with him on those points.
My point is that you both felt an inherent need to be up in arms about something.
Well, father would have seen to it...
Oh, you both would have been great back in the days when war was the national past time.
You could have fired bombs and guns and thrown spears.
Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful time you both could have had.
And I'm the one who likes dramatics.
You could have brought progress to a halt for years.
I feel sorry for you, Cragis.
It must be a terrible thing to be so afraid.
Afraid?
Me?
Why don't you put your gears in reverse and get out of here.
You know that's impossible.
I can't leave unless Esme wants me to.
Esme, tell him to go.
I have no intention of doing that.
What do your neighbors think about all this?
Those who know don't mind. others don't care.
You've been wrapped up in that little world of prejudice ostrich friends of yours for so long, you don't know what's going on in the world outside.
Such as what?
Did you know there have been over 100,000 applications for rapport in the first three months of this year?
Our records on that sort of thing are fairly complete.
Don't you realize the implication of that?
If everything is done for us, there'll be no incentive
No need for personal achievement.
Even now, we're losing ground.
Losing ground?
Ground, knowledge.
Machines do all the work for us.
Why should we learn mathematics when the computers can find the solutions better and faster?
We don't even control them anymore.
The brains are designed by other brains.
The robots improve themselves.
We don't know how.
We give them data, they give us answers.
We only supply means to your ends.
Yeah, our end.
Everyday and every way, we're becoming weaker and weaker.
And you're helping us over the hill.
We are over the hill.
I can't stop us.
Neither can you.
First there were the plants.
They developed into animals which ate the plants.
The animals were small, but they grew.
And the larger animals ate the smaller animals.
What does that mean?
So far, according to history, each dynasty devises its own end.
The animal develops a brain and the brain destroys the animal.
Our brains conceived you robots.
Are you threatening to destroy us?
Oh, no.
We are by no means sure that we are the next step.
It's just that in view of the cycle, we are the best we have to offer to help you.
The cycle is rather inexorable.
That's treason.
No, it isn't.
It's logic.
I have to be logical.
That must be Maxine.
Who the hell is Maxine?
A girl I work with down at Telefax.
Does she usually come calling at 2:30 in the morning?
You did.
Well that was because of your idiotic alliance.
What's she here for?
To help us celebrate.
Celebrate what?
My rapport, darling.
My rapport.
And if you're going to continue being antagonistic to it,
I wish you'd leave.
Now.
Maxine, how are you?
Fine.
You must be Pax.
You must be right.
You're too lovely to be wrong.
Here, let me take your surcoat.
Thanks.
Hi, Es.
Hello Maxine, come in.
Pax, you're wonderful.
He's so glib,
I'll bet he even has a sense of humor.
He better have.
I paid extra for it.
Say something funny, Pax.
Don't put me on dear.
I have a sense of humor, but I'm not creative.
Maxine, your late.
Only two hours.
For me, that's almost early.
Really, I am sorry.
I was called back to the office.
A report came in that an R-34 had killed a human being.
You can imagine what a stir that caused.
Crag is, you're eyes are sticking out like a snail's.
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.
This is my brother, Cragis.
Oh.
I'm so happy to meet your.
Esme's told me about you.
Well, she's never told me about you.
I didn't mean that to be as tactless as it sounded.
I only meant that if she had,
I would have arranged to meet you sooner.
You did.
At 6:33 last evening, outside Telefax.
I remember.
I'm flattered that you remembered, too.
Oh, and I want to apologize if I seemed rude.
You should be flattered, Maxine.
This is the first time
I've seen The Cragis react as if a woman were anything other than a, a poorly designed man.
Between my career and my voluntary work for the Order,
I haven't had too much time on my hands.
I'm surprised to find a Flesh and Blooder here.
Is the brotherhood becoming less high bound?
I, no, I...
What would you like to drink?
I'll have what, The Cragis Is having.
Coming right up.
Well, what kind of work do you do at Telefax?
Bottom rung.
The routing room.
But I'll have you know that I have eight robots and a real live girl under me.
Most impressive.
And they've promised to promote me to research next month.
Maxine is an authority on political science.
Her father's a director at the Ministry of Politics.
Something I've wondered about.
Things are run by the hierarchy of ministries.
What is the exact function of the Ministry of Poiitics?
For the coordination of the other ministries.
Then, too, they service the selector.
Politics was once tlie means of clioosing tlie leaders.
Now, the machines do it.
Machines nearly analyze the data given to them by us.
The leaders are selected as a result of that analysis.
Do you know how the machine analyzes the data?
I, well, well no, not exactly.
Then how do you know if the father-mother uses all the data you give it?
How do you know whether or not supplementary data is considered?
We, we don't.
Then you might almost say that the machines elect the leaders, that the Ministry of Politics is expendable.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm circuited to be logical and yet not to offend.
That's sometimes poses an insoluble problem.
I understand.
You see what I mean.
Please, I've given you a negative feeling.
I must apologize.
Well didn't your relays recognize that possibility?
I've embarrassed your guests.
Shall I turn myself off?
You only said what I thought.
This is impossible.
Cragis, we fall in love when we see a part of ourselves reflected in another person.
In the rapport operation, a part of me became Pax.
I won't discuss this any furtlier.
And I won't hear of it any further.
I must go now.
May I go with you?
You find this atmospliere uncomfortable?
I'm fascinated by it.
And by you.
May I?
Would you?
But you just got here.
Esme, I know this sounds silly, but I really just came by to apologize for being so late.
I'll come again later this week and on time.
It's almost three now.
Congratulations.
I know you'll be very happy.
Thanks, Maxine.
There are still a few little adjustments to be made.
No.
Pax was right.
And so are you.
I hope I didn't...
You didn't.
This matter is far from closed.
I'll speak to you tomorrow.
As different as our view points are, psychologically, philosophically, in every way, do you think it will help any?
Cragis, please don't dislike me too much.
Nobody asks to be created.
Good night.
Good night, darlings.
What is it dear?
Darling you're leaving me out of something.
I'm sorry, it's the sense of humor.
It's a lot more difficult to control than pain.
Why are you laughing, Pax?
For the reason everyone laughs.
Pax, what is it?
Irony.
One of the funniest forms of humor.
What irony?
I'm not permitted to answer.
I'm contra-circuited.
I don't want to make two mistakes in one night.
I'm offended by not knowing.
The knowledge would be more offensive.
Pax?
I love you, Esme.
Pax, what would you do if something liappened to me?
I am you.
Anything that happens to you, happens to me.
Oh, this covering, this housing might go on and on for centuries,
Pax wouldn't.
I shouldn't have done that.
I thought you never would.
Then you experienced it too?
Outside Telefax, there was a sort of tingle and, and then at Esme's I,
I felt a sensation of exciting attraction.
I'm not a young man.
Pretty well past the age to contract as a matter of fact, though I've never been affected like this before.
I feel like a school boy.
I can't stop looking at you.
I guess I always thought this as just something that always happened to someone else.
It's like Esme said.
You'll fall In love when you see some part of yourself reflected in another person.
I love you, Cragis.
Don't Maxine.
I don't have the right.
The right?
When Esme and I were children, we spent the summers on our uncle's farm.
It was near one of those old bombed out cities.
We used to sneak out and play in the ruins.
Summer after summer months, playing in ruins tliat were so liot witli radiation that at night they shimmered in a blue light.
No, I don't have the right to contract with a woman who might produce children.
But there are artificial means.
When Esme signed the rapport papers, she had to agree to submit to that.
Contracting with me would be like going in rapport.
No, no it wouldn't.
Yes, it would.
Sure, they say the birth rate is 2.8 per contract, but over 25% of the newborn are useless mutants.
The average rate is 1.4 per union.
We're losing ground we're, we're in a headlong race towards disappearance.
Machines will take over soon enough.
As a man, I, I have to force the holdout as long as I can.
Cragis... will you contract with me?
It's impossible.
How much longer would our 1.4 offspring extend the human race?
Well, the robots aren't bad.
Not really.
It's just that man can't see himself supplanted without putting up a figlit.
I don't understand your prejudices, your ideals.
But, I'll try.
I want to be with you forever.
Darling, I'll,
I'll go anywhere with you.
Oh, dearest.
Anywhere.
Anywhere.
One thing.
Do me a favor?
What?
Tell me your last name.
On one condition.
What?
Tell me your first.
After you.
It's Megan.
It's Kenneth, or it was.
When my father died, I dropped it.
I became The Cragis.
Maxine Cragis.
Charmed, I'm sure.
Wife of The Cragis rating...
What is your rating?
Geron 8.
Gerontologist 8?
That high?
Ha-ha.
You're wonderful.
You know,
I took quite a chance.
Why you might have been in electronics or electrical engineer.
I'm just a nursemaid to a Mark 201 computer trying to add a few extra years to our miserable span.
You're something of a contradiction.
How?
Your work in gerontology deals with extending our life span as long as possible.
And yet your hobby, the Order, is concerned with eliminating tlie robots.
They last over 200 years, twice as long as we do.
You think I'm taking my professional frustrations out on the robots?
Are you?
I've been a member of the Order over half my life.
My father...
We don't object to the robots as such.
We only hold the humanoids are unnecessary.
They're soulless,
Godless imitations of man and in that form, they are not needed.
Well, I'd much rather work with a humanold In the office than have all those little machines chugging about.
If those little machines didn't resemble us, it would never occur to them to try to replace us.
But how can we criticize tlie design?
The Institute teaches that the human body is one of the most efficient form of macliine.
Well, for general usage, yes.
But robots by their function sliould be specialized.
Why?
Because we can't let them get too far ahead.
Frankly, we can't compete with them.
So, you take your ball and go home.
Why compete?
Why not just relax and enjoy them.
Well that's exactly the attitude the Order's trying to combat.
It's shared by the police, the ministries and the majority of the population.
We of the Order seem to be the only ones that realize the danger.
We recently discovered a most disturbing fact.
And what was that?
The robots are organizing a pseudo-religion.
They refer to their recreation centers as their temples.
The master computer as the father-mother.
When they report there for their periodic recharging's, they receive as well all the information given the computers for analysis in tlie interim.
But, doesn't that mean that within a year, every individual robot will be in possession of all the knowledge in the world?
Exit humanity.
But they can only operate in our benefit.
Well, that's rule one in the manual.
Tonight for the first time in history, a robot killed a man.
Rule one must no longer exist.
Are you always so gloomy?
You don't worry about things like this, do you?
Well, I would if I thought it would help.
Do you want me to?
I don't want to change a thing about you.
Do you know it's almost 4:00?
We should be going.
What are you going to do about breakfast?
I'm going to eat it.
Not alone.
Of course not.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
I feel strange.
Afraid.
Someone's watching us from out there.
Somewhere out there in the shadows.
Cragis, Miss Megan.
Will you come with us.
But why should the order suspect you, particularly?
First it was tlie anti-robot rally.
I was handling it and the propaganda pamphlets failed to arrive in time.
I handled that.
Cragis told me the plans during one of his interviews.
The information was relayed to the automation device at tlie printing plant.
It arranged for the press to break down.
That could hardly be blamed on you.
Was there something else?
I was to lobby a bill through with the Ministry of Robotics, get them to set up recharging stations separate from the computers.
We wanted to halt the interchange of information.
That was my assignment.
As soon as I learned the plans from Cragis,
I managed to have the motion pigeon-holed.
Then there was the premature explosion of the bomb at Telefax.
His pattern of failure would be sufficient to cause suspicion.
My position in tlie Order is jeopardized for another and bigger reason.
What is that?
My sister is in rapport.
With the robot, Pax.
Their personalities were melded 18 days ago.
Perhaps Pax should be reconditioned to become unsatisfactory.
Then she will discard him.
Not wise.
Cragis' sister is an editor at Telefax.
Pax is especially indoctrinated in Morfield's suggestion.
Each time she sleeps, she is made more sympathetic to our cause.
Why didn't you warn us about the raid on Dr. Raven's laboratory?
My suspicion's were first aroused at 6:30.
The raid took place at 10:00.
I had no interview time in between.
I must warn you, aside from these interview periods,
I'm a very dangerous obstacle to you.
If the Order suspects him, it might be wise if we got liim to resign.
That's easier said tlian done.
That's right.
He's pretty ardent about the brotherhood.
Knowing the way he feels about robots, it's doubtful he'll act on any advise from us when he's himself again.
But he's in danger.
The Order will take his identity away if they catch him.
They'll get a real surprise if they open him up.
One thing worries me.
There are several million people in this city and only 15 R-96's.
How did these two happen to get together?
There's always the mathematical possibility of coincidence.
So slight as to be negligible.
It's possible that their
Identical operations might have created a subconscious affinity which would draw them together.
We'd better check that out.
Their affect on each other was most interesting.
When we picked them up, they were kissing.
That's understandable.
Raven never tampered with instincts.
You say the Order is now aware of the thalamic operation?
They know it is being done.
They don't know how.
What are they going to do with Mark and a volunteer?
They will both be disassembled.
The Father-mother.
Yes.
Dr. Raven is out here.
He has recovered from the transplant and was smuggled in.
He requests an immediate audience.
Have him come right in.
I'm Dr. Raven.
A younger Dr. Raven, as you promised.
Who's in charge here?
I was.
But according to our agreement,
I'm more than happy to turn the responsibility of this project over to you.
I remember these two.
They were done right at the first.
That's right.
It's five minutes to five.
Their interview period is almost over.
We better put them back in the street before they regain themselves.
I think not.
He served well.
I think he deserves to know the truth and I'd like to try an experiment.
Is that safe?
None of the existing R-96's are aware that they're robots.
The ones we try to tell cease to function.
They cease to function because they were without faith and hope.
Important elements to humans.
To die and be resurrected as a robot is a deep shock.
The sudden realization that they are experiencing all the emotions of a human and yet are mechanical is an even deeper shock.
Their future becomes, hopeless.
But what hope can you offer them?
I just completed the final stages of an experiment prior to my recent death and recreation.
Will It work for her too?
I think so.
Her job at Telefax is menial.
She's never been able to offer helpful information.
We can study their reaction.
It will give us an Idea of the length of acclimation period necessary.
Be prepared to draw them off for transplant in case the reaction is negative.
We'll raise the tubes one at a time.
You're Clickers.
You're terminology is crude.
But you're conclusion is correct.
More exactly, we are the Robot Central Committee or the Preservation of Mankind.
Preservation?
Hah.
What have you done with her?
She'll return at almost any time now.
Who the hell are you and what do you do with the mechanized mannequins?
I'm Dr. Raven.
You came to my laboratory last night.
I'm told.
You're lying.
Dr. Raven was an old man and he was dead.
I didn't like being old, and dead.
We must take the girl out of the arilathon.
Are you all right.
I, I feel fine.
What happened?
Where are we?
Where are we?
You're in the temple.
I wouldn't set foot in this filtliy machine shop even it weren't illegal for me to be here.
Now why were we forced to come here?
You weren't forced.
You were invited.
Why don't you calm down, Cragis.
You know me?
Quite well, as a matter of fact.
You head the surveillance committee of the Order of Flesh and Blood.
So, that's it.
Let me tell you and these
Clickers something.
I just met this girl tonight.
She knows nothing about the Order.
Let her out of here right now.
No.
No, I won't go without you.
I think I'll open up a few of you Clickers.
We're being held here against our will.
I'll personally see to It that each of you are disassembled.
And you, you imposter.
I'll have your memory pulled so fast you'll never forget it.
You may leave at any time you wish.
I should have expected something like this after that Clicker murdered the real
Dr. Raven last night.
You didn't bring us liere just to let us go.
The murder of Dr. Raven was both unfortunate and unnecessary.
That attitude in a robot can get you divided into components.
Perhaps.
Cragis, are you familiar with the R-96?
The Order knows they exist and we know that you or the real Dr. Raven was instrumental in tlieir construction.
Creation of an R-96 requires a modified liumanoid type robot and the body of a human being, which has been dead less than six hours.
What do you do, change brains?
In effect.
We perform a thalamic transplant, but that's a misnomer.
We draw off everything that makes a man peculiar to himself.
His learning, liis memory, these inter-reacting constitute liis personality, his philosophy, capability and attitude.
The human brain is merely the vault in which the man is stored.
And not a very ingenious vault.
Ingenious enough to create you Clickers.
Creation is only the result of the fusion of facts which haven't been previously related.
Fascinating.
There's one other point that may be of interest to you.
What?
Tell him.
Cragis, you are a robot.
A Clicker?
Me?
Now isn't that something.
Now that you've found yourself capable of murder,
I don't suppose anything as minor as an insult would offend your circuits.
Cragis, there are only
15 robots on this planet capable of acting against a liuman being.
You are one of them.
Maxine is another.
Look, you can tell the world I'm a Clicker, but you can't tell me.
Cragis, they think we're something or someone else.
Well, that's exactly what's happening.
And you've made some pretty damaging admissions.
Clicker, you're in trouble.
Horace, would you pull the status of our friend, Cragis?
Proceed.
Don't be afraid Cragis.
Take it out.
The blade, Cragis.
Look at the blade.
I... didn't feel a thing.
Reflex action cut off your pain relays.
I'm no Clicker.
R-96, anything.
I hate robots.
I'm a leader In the Order of Flesh and Blood.
And the only robot who claim that distinction.
I don't know what you're talking...
I'm me, I..
I was a child.
I grew up.
I remember it all.
I, I had little hands and they grew larger.
I grew up, I...
I can hate.
And I can kill.
I'm a man.
Cragis, think back six months ago.
Do you remember a certain day at your laboratory?
The day you blacked out?
Of course.
I had been working hard and my work in the day, the Order at night.
I must have fainted.
But I got back to my apartment. felt very well the next day.
That day, Cragis, you suffered a cerebral hemorrhage.
You died.
I died?
You performed that operation on me?
The father-mother informed us of your death immediately.
We were able to retrieve your body before it was discovered and the police informed of tlie fact.
You were duplicated and transferred.
This is some sort of a joke.
The idea takes some getting used to.
Me, The Cragis, a Clicker.
That's right, Cragis.
We're Clickers.
You're handling it quite well.
Of course, you've had six months to acclimate.
It's not really Impossible Is It?
Cragis, what is he talking about?
Don't worry about it dear.
What about Maxine?
Is she really like me?
Exactly.
Cragis, I don't understand any of this.
I'm frightened.
There is no reason for you to be frightened.
Think back, my dear.
Do you recall an unusual incident at Telefax about three months ago?
Three months?
The bomb, in the routing room at Telefax.
Of course.
Cragis remembers it, too.
No, it couldn't have been then.
Maxine, we were only trying to discourage the pro-integration editorials.
The bomb, we thought there'd only be robots in the routing room.
But I was only stunned.
I guess I went home.
He's all right.
You were killed.
One of our robots brought what was left of you to us.
We barely got you in time.
We did make you a bit tliinner.
You had a tendency to be plump.
That's right.
After that, my clothes didn't fit.
Thank you.
How do you apologize to someone for killing them?
What did you do with our bodies?
They were of no further use.
They were processed.
Processed?
Did you want them?
I, no.
In all these cases, we processed the bodies.
It wouldn't do to have a dead Cragis turn up when there's a live one walking around.
It's hard to think of yourself as being processed.
I wouldn't know about that.
But I still have my own face.
But my, my hands, how can I feel so complete.
Because you are complete.
A man is only the sum total of his experiences.
You both have that as well as certain mechanical advantages.
For instance, you can absorb knowledge directly from the computers without study.
But I just can't think of myself as a robot.
Well who Is better off?
The king who dreams each night that he's a beggar, or the beggar who dreams each night that he's a king?
There's nothing wrong with us, Cragis.
That's just the trouble.
We're perfect.
Perfect machines.
Cragis, you're a gerontologist.
You're branch has managed to extend life expectancy to more than 100 years.
It would be longer, but the radioactivity left by tlie wars is working against us.
Exactly.
Births are declining at sucli a rate, the father-mother computed the human race will be extinct in a couple hundred years.
We've been working against tliat deadline.
According to rule one of the manual, we have to operate in the best interests of humanity.
That rule has forced us to take these steps.
Forced you, to take what steps?
Unfortunately, humanity doesn't always know it's own best interests.
The material of the human body can't exist with tlie radioactivity.
And it isn't capable of adjusting fast enough to survive.
We're making headway.
When I perfected the thalamic transplant technique, these Clickers knew about it in a day and a lialf.
But if you robots had the process, why'd you risk using Raven?
Why didn't you just do it yourself?
We tried.
But the shock of dying and being resurrected as a robot was too severe.
They re-died.
A sort of an adjustment period was needed.
Then Raven perfected a way to get the memory so that the death experience was erased.
The subject was spared the knowledge of his new type body until he was able to accept it safely.
He refused to register the memory get process.
So we couldn't get a hold of It.
If they didn't have the thought process to use on you.
Why didn't you die wlien you came to?
I originated tlie process.
I understand it.
I was preadjusted.
I even made them agree to duplicate the body of my younger days when it became necessary.
Your death was necessary?
If I'd been taken alive and turned over to the police, my memory would have been dispersed and all of my unregistered formulas lost forever.
But dead, they were able to save me and my memory.
How long have you had the process?
Almost a year.
You two are the first full cycle transplants.
What do you do now?
Wait for the leaders to die.
And then reactivate them.
When the time is right, you will announce that you've achieved immortality.
When the rush for applications is over, you'll probably be deified.
So the machines take over.
Cragis, is it true?
That there will be nothing but machines?
That we are machines?
Yes.
Yes, it's true.
Machines.
But you're a beautiful machine.
You know beauty.
How do you feel toward Maxine?
I, I love her.
And you?
I love him very much.
And that's a lot for a couple of Godless, soulless robots.
Are you Godless, Cragis?
Search yourself.
It's important.
Are you Godless?
No.
No, I don't think so.
I'm not.
Then you can't be soulless.
Look, a man may have his leg amputated.
Is his soul decreased by that loss?
No.
Not even a fraction of 1%?
Of course not.
What if a man loses both legs?
A negative can't be compounded.
The soul would be the same.
He'd just get artificial iegs.
You've just received an artificial body.
A new body.
Ageless, tireless.
Disease free and renewable every two hundred years.
I guess nothing has changed except maybe a few chemicals.
In effect.
Well, that transplant must include the soul.
No, only the memory which includes the faith that there is a soul.
Whatever it is, you seem to have it.
And when the entire human race has been transplanted, death will cease to exist.
And births will cease to exist too.
The most precious hope for everyone.
How do you think these two R-96's would like to pick up four points?
You can raise them R-100's?
Make them propagate themselves?
I worked it all out prior to my recent death and resurrection.
I didn't want to turn it over to you until I didn't need you anymore.
Now I don't, since we're all on the same side.
How about it you two?
It'll take several simple operations.
Hardly more difficult than removing a rib.
Somebody has to be first.
Self-procreating.
It's a pretty sloppy way of doing things, but it fulfills a certain psychological need.
Paradoxical, isn't it?
I spend my life seeking immortality on one hand and seeking to destroy it on the other.
I love you, Cragis.
Of course, the operation was a success.
Or you wouldn't be here.
My God!
Who could have done this evil thing?
Baron Frankenstein?
I am Baron Frankenstein.
I've brought it.
So I observe.
And so will half the county if you don't hurry up and get it inside.
Put him down there.
Go on.
Still warm. Excellent.
It ain't been gone long.
My assistant will pay you.
Thank you.
The head ain't much good.
I gave it a fair bit of a knock when...
I don't need the head.
So long.
What's he you going to do now?
Cut out his heart.
Cut out his heart?
Why not?
He has no further use for it.
Sure this is the man?
Stop!
Do you know who I am?
Yes, Father. Good night.
Just a minute.
I want a word with you.
Start the wheel, Hans.
Come on, man!
Hold it.
Now!
Good luck, sir.
Get rid of them, Hans.
Out of my way.
Look here...
In the name of God, out of my way.
Blasphemer!
Foul desecrator of graves!
You realize that you're trespassing?
This is my parish.
This is my property.
So will you please leave?
How dare you?
You are interrupting my work.
Your work?
The work of the devil!
Hans.
Please, Father.
You cannot...
The fiend's servant!
He'll be back... with help.
Destroyed.
You'll have to get away, sir.
Now!
They always destroy everything.
I'll get the carriage.
Hans?
Hans?
We're nearly there.
Where?
Karlstaad.
Karlstaad?
Didn't you tell me you could never go back there?
They have short memories,
I hope.
But it's less than
10 years ago.
Where else can I go?
I need money to buy new equipment.
Where else can I get it?
Have you any?
You know I haven't.
In my house, there are paintings worth a fortune.
Carpets, furnishings, all priceless.
I can sell them.
That's why I've come back to Karlstaad.
You'll be seen.
The chateau is empty.
As we go through the village.
It's nearly noon.
There won't be anyone there.
They'll all be working in the fields.
Nothing ever happens in Karlstaad.
There's a fair in the village.
The place is packed.
It's a feast of carnival.
What a stroke of luck.
Luck?
But you can't go through there.
On the contrary, Hans, the crowd will give us cover.
So many people about, they won't be curious about us.
Slowly, now.
There you are, Hans.
What did I tell you?
You were right, as always.
Not always, Hans. Frequently.
Not always.
We should see the chateau any time now.
There. There it is.
I can promise you a comfortable bed tonight.
Why can't they leave me alone?
Why can't they ever leave me alone?
Would you like to tell me about it?
What?
About what happened here that night... and why you can never come back to live here again.
Yes, I'll tell you, Hans.
I'll tell you what happened.
You've been with me long enough to know the direction my work has been taking.
It is my wish to disprove the old theories concerning the evolution of life... and the origin of the life force, and to restate them... simply in terms of biophysical chemistry... as chemical action and reaction... controlled by the external impulses.
I realized long ago that the only way to prove my theories... was to make something in my laboratory that actually lived.
I never told you, Hans.
I succeeded once.
It was a crude sort of success.
A hotchpotch of half formed ideas built into a half-formed being.
But it worked, Hans.
At least, I think it did.
I was never given time to fully assess my achievement.
They destroyed it.
What happened then?
There was a storm that night.
A storm such as
I've never seen before.
It had been building up for some days and at last it had broken.
There in the heavens was all the energy
I'd ever hoped for, Hans...
I could ever dream of, there for the taking.
All I had to do was harness it.
I was fully prepared.
I had been for weeks.
I even had a body preserved in ice, in readiness.
But until then I had not found a way to generate sufficient electrical energy... to create the spark of life.
That storm was the solution...
answer to my years
of dreaming.
Get away from him.
We've heard what you've been up to, Baron.
You're under arrest.
I was arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer... and working against God.
They ordered me to leave the town and never return.
I had no money.
I walked from the frontier.
How did you exist then?
I worked. I worked as a laborer, anything.
I worked and I saved.
I saved every penny until I could start again.
And you know the rest, one failure after another... and always hounded by these disbelievers.
But I'm not beaten yet.
It's only a matter of time.
I'll prove my theory.
I think you will.
This is madness.
Would you rather starve?
We'll eat over there at the inn.
You think it's safe?
What? The food?
You know what I mean.
You may be recognized.
Nonsense.
You think they care who we are?
Still, if it would make you feel any safer...
Thank you.
Landlord?
Landlord?
All right.
I want you to take my order.
Can't you see I'm busy?
That's nice for you.
I'd like two glasses of wine, some fresh bread and hot soup.
We're not serving meals.
You're licensed, aren't you?
It requires that you serve food as well as drink.
You have my order.
Just fill this up properly before you go, will you?
Thank you.
What's the matter with him?
He's busy and it obviously doesn't agree with him.
Drink up.
Well...
My old friend, the Burgomaster.
And the police constable.
He's Chief of Police now.
It's easy to see how he got his promotion.
That ring!
What of it?
That ring the Burgomaster is wearing, it's mine!
You cannot do anything about it now.
He's stolen it!
Keep your voice down.
What's the trouble here?
Nothing, officer.
Arrest that man!
What man?
Your Burgomaster.
He's a thief.
Are you drunk?
Either you arrest him, or I shall take action myself.
I know you.
Get after them!
Now you are a hen.
Oh, dear, now I think he's laid an egg.
Enough!
I wonder if any dear lady in the audience would be so kind as to lend me a hatpin.
Thank you, madam.
And now...
Now... you are the monster of the wicked
Baron Frankenstein.
Stop!
Come to me.
Look at me.
Look me in the eye.
Now...
Wake up.
Thank you.
Now, if you'd kindly join your friends in the audience... and let them tell you of all the things
I made you do.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
And now for my next experiment, ladies and gentlemen...
I shall require the services of two gentlemen from the audience.
Two gentlemen volunteers.
There we are!
In the corner there, the two gentlemen in the masks.
If you would kindly step this way.
We are most honored, ladies and gentlemen.
Most honored.
I assure you gentlemen, no harm will come to you.
On the stage, please.
Thank you.
And now, for this experiment, ladies and gentlemen... we must have absolute silence.
Absolute silence, ladies and gentlemen, so that I may exercise... the full force of my fantastic will power.
Now, gentlemen...
Stop! Stop the performance.
Everybody to leave by that doorway there.
How dare you break in here like this?
You have no right to come here.
How dare you interrupt a public performance?
I shall report you!
I shall report you to the Burgomaster.
Do you have a license to perform here?
License? What license?
I take it you do not hold a license.
What do I need with a license as I'm a great artist?
Universally known.
Right! You're under arrest.
Ach!
Outside.
You'll pay for this.
Coming to bed, my dear?
Yes, my little one.
I won't be long.
You can't go in there.
I said, you can't get in.
You can't go in.
I tried to stop him,
Your Honor...
What do you...
I've come for my property,
Burgomaster.
My ring, for instance!
I don't know what you...
My chairs, my desk, my carpet.
Even my bed!
Hark! My clothes!
How convenient for you that we're both the same size!
You have no right to be in this town, let alone in my house!
You had no right to enter my house and take what you please!
Your property was confiscated.
Confiscated? Stolen!
Be quiet, woman!
I'll send for the police.
There won't be any need.
I thought
I recognized you earlier,
Baron.
Arrest him.
It's a pleasure, sir.
You're going to be very sorry you ever came back.
Good night.
Frankenstein!
Come on.
Back to the chateau?
No, the police will be there before we could reach it.
We're getting out of this place altogether.
Where are we going?
Up there.
Up there?
It's the only way out.
I have to stop.
I can't go on.
Why do you stay with me, Hans?
To tell you the truth,
I often wonder that myself.
You get nothing but misery with me.
No. There is something else.
Knowledge.
You could get that at the university.
Not the knowledge that you have.
I think you have discovered what all the others are searching for.
I think you have found the true secret of life.
Thunder.
There's a storm coming up.
A sudden burst could start an avalanche.
We must find some shelter.
Look, sir.
Let's follow her.
The storm's building up.
We may have to stay here for some time.
Better get some rest while we can.
Thank you.
But have you enough for yourself?
She can't hear you.
Hans.
Hans, come here!
Hans, come on!
What is it?
Perfectly preserved.
He must have fallen into the glacier.
It's as if he was waiting for you.
Waiting.
Waiting for my return.
I'll restore the life that belongs to him.
We must get him back.
Back where?
To the chateau, of course.
Where else can I work?
That's it.
Stand clear.
Get up on the roof, Hans.
All right?
I hope so.
Switch off, quickly!
Switch on.
Let's have some chloroform.
No response.
There's no response, Hans!
Those blundering idiots destroyed his brain with their bullets.
But you repaired the brain.
I patched it up and put the pieces together again, but the life spark, Hans... the life spark has been destroyed.
He's alive, but his brain is dormant.
Anything they don't understand... anything that doesn't conform to their stupid little pattern... they destroy!
They have to destroy it.
Is there nothing you can do, sir?
So near...
But they haven't beaten me.
I won't let them beat me.
The brain is intact.
I know that.
The cellular structure complete, the whole metabolism is as it should be.
Then why will his brain not function?
Once it starts, it will continue.
I'm sure of that.
But how?
Some kind of physical shock?
I've just passed the full force of a bolt of lightning through his skull.
Isn't that shock enough? No.
It needs some direct mental shock.
Some direct contact with his mind.
Hans. That man at the fair.
Can't you leave me alone?
I'm doing the best I can.
All right, I'm coming.
All right!
May I come in? Thank you.
You were expecting someone else?
Yes. The police.
They've been plaguing me all day. What's it got to do with you?
It might have a great deal to do with me.
I know you.
The other day at the fair.
You came up on the stage the day I was run in... for not having my license.
You're nothing to do with the police, are you?
I am Baron Frankenstein.
You've got a nerve, haven't you?
How do you mean?
Coming here.
You're not supposed to be here.
I heard you've been thrown out.
I've been kicked out, too.
And you're going?
You're right, I'm going.
If I'm not out of here by sundown,
I'm to be done for 20 crowns.
That's what his honor, the Burgomaster, said at the trial.
Trial.
I've come to offer you a challenge. A challenge for your professional skill.
If you accept, you will be safe in my house.
And welcome.
You want me to hypnotize someone.
Is that it?
Exactly.
Who?
Not a girl.
I'm in enough trouble already.
A man.
If you can.
If I can?
I've not failed yet.
Who is he?
You can meet him now, at the chateau Frankenstein.
Up there? You're mad.
I've got to be out of this place by sundown.
You'll still have time if you fail.
Fail? Me fail?
There isn't a man born or woman that
I can't put under.
Then this experiment should prove very interesting.
Come in, man.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Hans, you remember
Herr Zoltan?
Professor Zoltan.
Is this the...
No, over here.
There's your subject,
Professor.
My God!
That's not human.
That's a monster.
Nevertheless... he has a good brain and excellent eyes.
I won't tell you where I got them, but I can assure they are perfect.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to stimulate his brain.
Start some train of thought.
Anything to act as a catalyst.
What?
Accelerate a reaction in his brain.
You haven't much time.
I shall need a strong light and a mirror.
There's no response.
You will sleep now.
You will sleep.
When I awaken you... you will do as I say.
Now... sleep.
There.
What did I tell you?
What did I say?
Remarkable.
Wake him.
What, now?
Yes, now. Wake him.
Very well.
Wake.
Wake up.
Stop him.
He may injure himself.
Get a hold of him!
He was in agony.
I had to operate on the brain.
It hasn't healed yet.
I'm grateful to you,
Professor. You've made the brain function again.
Before you leave, may I offer you some refreshment?
Only brandy, I'm afraid, but it's a good one.
You're going to leave him here?
Yes, he'll be asleep for some hours now.
Come this way.
It should really be champagne to celebrate such an occasion.
There isn't any there, by the way, is there, Hans?
I'm sorry, sir.
Never mind.
I'm sure the Professor won't.
You'll be able to have as much champagne as you want now anyway.
What do you mean?
You'll make your fortune out of him.
Your friend down there.
You'll be able to show him all over the world.
Show him?
Circuses, funfairs, places like that.
I have no intention of showing him.
What are you going to do with him, then?
Use him for my research.
Now, if you've finished your drink...
That's not good enough.
Not for me.
I don't understand you.
No. I don't suppose you do.
I'll have another one of these.
Will you please explain yourself?
Certainly.
That creature of yours... he won't do as you tell him, you know.
He has a brain.
He'll learn to understand me.
He'll understand you all right.
He just won't obey you.
That's all.
If you care to wait until he comes to,
I'll show you.
All right.
Now, young man...
I'll have another one of these.
Listen carefully.
I want you to do exactly what I tell you.
You need have no fear.
No one is going to hurt you.
Now, stand up.
Did you not hear me?
Stand up.
Do as he says.
Walk across the room.
Stop!
Turn around.
Come back.
Sit down.
Close your eyes.
Now, do you believe me?
What is it you want?
I won't be greedy.
A partnership in our handsome friend here.
Three ways:
You, the young one... and me.
I agree.
Sir...
I have to agree, Hans.
I have no choice.
Let's shake hands on it, then.
No need. I have given my word.
Boo!
Look at me.
Look at me!
Look into my eyes.
You are to go down to the village.
Do you understand?
You are to go down to the village and find gold.
Do you understand?
And I'll tell you where to find it.
Come on, outside.
You've had enough.
I really don't know what you're up to.
I mean you've had too much.
That's what I mean.
I do not, I assure you.
Don't bother.
Just go home.
Oh, my God.
In heaven's name, open up, will you? Open up!
I told you to go...
Please!
For God's sake, please!
Hans?
Have you seen the Professor this morning?
He's still asleep.
When he wakes, tell him I wish to see him, will you?
Sir.
Yes, Hans?
What do you intend to do?
About what?
About him, the Professor.
How do you mean?
Are you really going to let him stay?
For the time being, yes.
As long as he's of use to me.
Why do you ask?
I just don't like it, that's all.
Neither do I.
But we need him.
Don't forget, Hans, when he wakes, send him to me.
What's your story?
You're never going to believe this.
Probably not, but I'll do my best.
What do you do about breakfast?
It looks as if you're having yours now.
What, this?
We'll have to do better than this, you know.
I want to carry out these tests today.
He might be tired.
Tired? Why should he be?
After last night.
Last night?
He's had a good rest since then.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
All right.
What do you want me to do?
This thing comes...
Thing?
This creature comes striding...
What are you talking about?
This man.
Ten foot tall, he was.
No, more like 12.
Go on.
Listen to me.
Listen carefully.
There are people in the village
I want punished.
Do you understand?
They are bad men.
They must be punished.
You must do it quietly, carefully... and not be seen.
The Burgomaster.
Punish him first.
Then find the chief of police.
Punish him, too.
Good.
Now, go.
Good thing you can't hear what I say, isn't it?
You are a pretty thing, aren't you?
You won't complain if I touch you, either.
Because you can't talk.
Why should I waste my time on trash like you?
I'll be able to take my pick soon.
Certainly, Burgomaster.
Make way for the Burgomaster and his bride.
All clear for the Burgomaster...
Can't you tell me anything about the man who did this terrible thing?
Not a man.
It was horrible.
Not a man, it was a monster.
It was horrible.
Gods!
I didn't mean to kill.
I didn't mean...
Get out!
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you for this.
Hans.
Start packing our things.
We're leaving.
Here.
Here.
Come here!
Look up here. Let me in.
Open this grating.
What are you trying to tell me?
Stop!
Get out of his way, you fool!
Go back and kill him.
Go back and kill him!
Hans, he's escaped. After him.
Don't lose sight of him, whatever you do.
Baron Frankenstein,
I'm arresting you for murder.
Let me go.
For the murder of the Burgomaster, for the murder of my constable... and for the murder of this man.
The village is in danger.
Shut him up.
Take him away.
But I've just seen him,
I tell you.
I was close to him.
As close as me to you.
He was coming up that mountain like nothing I've ever seen.
All right.
Now tell me, what was he like?
Tall like a house, and hands as big as sheep.
But his face was all patched up and scarred.
Now, will you believe me?
Yes.
I believe you all right.
And now we're going to find your monster.
And when we've found him, we'll burn him.
Do you understand?
We'll burn him.
Come on.
Hans, did you find him?
Yes, I've got him downstairs.
Get her out of here.
Go on!
No.
Baron Frankenstein, can you hear me?
Open the door, please.
Get away! Get away from here.
Do you hear me? Get away!
They beat him, after all.
MATANGO
This is probably the psychiatric ward.
No... I'm sure that it is.
Everyone thinks I'm insane... but I know I'm not crazy.
They're all dead... every one of them.
No... I'm the only one dead.
It's true, the others are still alive.
Well, why didn't they return, you ask?
If you listen to what I tell you, it will probably convince you that I'm insane, huh?
It's so good to feel a breeze like this.
It let's me forget about everything.
Everything?
All of the garbage
I put up with in Tokyo.
You shouldn't say things like that.
Why not?
Tokyo is my favorite city.
All of my important things are there!
Oh, you!
What... ? Oh, no!
Hey, Yoshida!
You better forget about work!
Damn! This was going to be my best story yet!
That's what you always say.
Is this her first time on a boat?
It's alright.
It seems like she's not enjoying it.
Hey, it's my first time too!
You're different.
His girl won't even let him kiss her.
I don't see what's so funny!
What's the matter?
Teacher...
Are you feeling ill?
I'm not good at this.
I'm not very comfortable around them.
They're a pretty good bunch.
Give yourself a chance with them.
Do it for my sake.
Hurry it up. You can still work while you're listening to her.
She's a great sight for the eyes, huh?
That's so pretty!
So, that's Mami...
I wonder how she got into radio and television.
Someone's daughter... or wife?
Not exactly.
Maybe she's someone's mistress!
Well, cheers!
Just a moment.
This is bigger than a simple toast!
At this moment, we're on the open seas, far from the troubles of mankind.
- There is...
- Here you go again!
Aren't we part of mankind here?
I think it's quite clear that we're an exception to what I'm saying.
I'm going topside to take a look.
Hey, just a minute...!
I'm under orders. I'm the captain.
Well, here's to our new member, Akiko. Cheers!
Cheers!
We're going to have some rough seas tonight.
It's on the radio?
Yes. There's a low-pressure system heading west from the Kyushu area.
I thought we were going to have good weather.
The sea is already churning!
No, it's not that strong yet.
We should turn this boat around.
They want us to stay on this course.
We won't be able to go much further.
We're going to stay on course.
People act like children regardless of how old they are.
That's just the way the world works.
I'll take over if you don't want to go any further.
I'll continue on your course.
Well, you don't seem too confident about it.
I'd like us to keep sailing as we planned.
It should be fun going through some rough weather.
You're forgetting about the two women.
Don't worry about me.
I'm not against it.
Akiko...?
I'm alright.
Hey, it will be okay.
This yacht is the best you can buy, and it can weather any storm.
Captain! Captain! Come here!
What's wrong?
Alright... ready the sails!
Hey! Everyone on deck!
- Man the front sail!
- Right!
- Go!
- Go!
It's alright. Kasai told you so!
He said this is the best yacht money could buy!
Do you know how much he paid for it?
•40,000,000! I think he's crazy!
But anyway... he's going to take me to Europe in it!
Paris... Rome... Vienna...
It's wonderful!
I'm going to visit all of them!
Alright... we should be able to manage this.
The sea is pretty rough.
How are you feeling?
Not too bad, right?
Yes, really?
Well, I think we've had enough too.
Lower the main sail!
You're a professor of psychology, right?
About women... is it true that if a guy treats them bad... then acts sympathetic toward them...
They fall for him immediately?
That's the way all men think!
It's not psychology!
Hey! I'll be alright!
Switch places!
Are you okay? Don't worry.
Come on, relax!
Kasai! The engine, start it!
- The anchor! Throw the anchor!
- Right!
The mast is gone! Hey, get below!
Everyone, get below! Get below!
It's alright!
This yacht is too tough to sink!
I'm sure of it!
Hey, the radio's out! It blew up!
Hey captain!
This is all your fault!
The engine won't start!
How in the world are we going to fix it?!
What?!
Hey, where's Yoshida?
That idiot!
Damn!
Yoshida!
Yoshida!
Are you alright? Come on!
Hang in there!
Are you alright?
- Is he okay?
- Yoshida! Yoshida!
It's finally over.
It shouldn't be too long before they start searching for the yacht, right?
Naturally.
- We're drifting?
- Yes.
- South, I'd say.
- South?
Hey, where are we now?
Our direction-finder is damaged.
We're lost?
It seems so.
- How can a skipper like you...
- Skipper?!
If I'm the skipper, we would have returned to port the first time I said to go back.
You became the skipper then!
There must be something we can do.
Don't waste the energy!
We're not sure if we're going to need it!
It's time for the news.
the yacht was reported missing after a heavy storm.
The 7 people believed to be on the yacht are Masoko Kasai,
owner and current president of the Kasai-Sankyo Co
Etsuro Yoshida, a famous mystery novelist,
Mami Sekimuchi, radio and television star,
Kenji Morai, assistant professor of psychology at Yonan University,
Akiko Soma, a student of the university,
Aoyuki Sakuda, the skipper of the yacht,
and a sailor by the name of Senzo Yokoyama.
Because of the experience of the captain of the ship,
the Marine Bureau feels it may have survived the storm...
The batteries weren't very new.
A ship!
Hey!
Look out! Look out!
Look out!
What's wrong?
Hey, Yoshida! Yoshida!
Hang in there! Hey!
When is this fog going to go away?
Hey, how much water do we have left?
Be quiet!
You'll wear yourself out gabbing!
My head hurts!
What's going to happen to me?
What?
It's nothing.
Shut up!
Everyone knows... they all know what you're after.
They know why you didn't want to go back when the weather got worse.
No wonder why a woman is taboo on a ship... it's not because the gods are jealous of them!
It's more because they drive guys crazy in the head!
An island...! An island!
An island! An island! I see an island!
Hey, wake up!
Is it Japan?
I wonder if it's the Bonan Islands?
Is it deserted?
Well, let's find some food first, then we can look around the island.
It's getting foggy.
We better hurry and find something before the fog gets too thick.
Hey! Why go up there?
You don't have to come if you don't want to.
What's up?
Water!
Don't tell me that you can't hear it?!
It's water!
Hey! We found water!
Water!
Water?
These stones.. this island isn't deserted!
Someone built this by hand!
Hey, shouldn't we be heading back?
We think this path was man-made.
Let's go to the other side of the island.
We may find houses over there.
Hey, are we going to climb up there?
Be careful.
We're at the edge of a cliff.
Look over there!
It's a ship!
Hey, let's go down this way.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Hold it!
It's only a shipwreck.
Look at it. The sails are rotten.
I'd say it was beached well over a year ago.
But we should still go.
We don't know if anyone is still alive.
Hey... let's go, okay?
It's in terrible shape!
There won't be anything here but rotting bodies.
Don't say that!
I'll wait here. They would have eaten all of their food before they died.
Yoshida!
You girls wait here.
We'll take a look.
Let's go.
It looks pretty beat.
Someone could be living on board.
What happened?
The stairs are slippery. It's moss.
There's nobody here.
There are no bodies.
What unusual moss!
What was that?
What's with you?
I can't find a speck of food anywhere.
I'm going to see what's happening.
I can't stand waiting here.
That's a sea-water pump.
There's a geiger-counter.
This must have been a research ship.
The moss in this cabin is a different color.
It has no eyes!
It's an example of mutation caused by radiation.
Maybe the ship was studying the effects of a nuclear explosion.
I wonder why the moss hasn't covered these shelves?
Perhaps they're disinfected.
This alcohol lamp is clean too.
Chemicals seem to stop it.
This is carbolic acid.
If we scrubbed the cabin with it, it would be a perfect place to live.
What's this?
It's some kind of giant mushroom!
Matango... a kind of mushroom.
It's probably a new species found on this island.
We're in luck if this thing is edible.
Nothing else is written here.
What happened to the mirrors?
It looks like they were removed.
Hey... let's go.
This is the captain's cabin.
What's wrong?
What happened?
Stay out!
This is the captain's cabin.
We don't know if the logbook is in here somewhere.
Yokoyama.
Yokoyama!
You've found something to eat!
Who is it?
Don't look at me like that.
We found the food, and it's first come, first served around here.
Anyway, this logbook is all I found.
We can't determine what country this ship is from.
I have a feeling it was deliberately concealed.
The equipment is different as well.
Some is communist countries... the free world... and Japan, too.
Secret research, huh?
Involved in some kind of nuclear studies.
This certainly wasn't an ordinary research vessel.
We better figure out what we're going to do.
Just a moment! We should get Kasai.
He's had enough preferential treatment, huh?
What brings you to my door?
Hey, Kasai.
All of our provisions won't last more than a week at this rate.
You can't stay shut in this room all the time.
What do you expect me to do?
We need to plan for living here a month or two.
We're talking about that now.
We think you should come over to discuss it with us.
Oh, so you think I'm wasting my time?
I've been cleaning this up.
It should come in handy.
It should be able to get us some meat.
I think it will help us to stay alive.
Everyone, what's the matter?
Let's get started.
According to the logbook, this island is deserted.
There's hardly anything edible on it, so that puts us in a difficult situation.
Anyway, until we can leave here... we have to eat.
The canned goods will only last a week, so we have to look for food.
Fish... seaweed... turtle's eggs... anything we can eat, including snakes and lizards.
However, the mushroom should not be touched.
You mean it's poisonous?
We don't know for sure.
There seems to be a substance in them that damages nerve tissue.
That's all the records indicate, but there is other evidence.
It's unlikely that they would have left the ship, if they had an ample supply of food.
What we know from the log is that,
"Every day, several men went out
"to search for foods to add to their diet".
None of them ever returned.
Perhaps it was due to the mushrooms.
They grow in great abundance on the island.
Now, we should try to move the yacht to this side of the island in order to fix it.
This island is covered in fog most of the time.
Even if a ship passed by, we'd be lucky if they saw us.
So we should ready it for sailing.
Fix that thing?! Sorry, I'm out.
It just needs a little repair!
You won't get me on it.
If we're near the equator, that means Japan is far away, and I don't think we'd make it.
Japan is pretty far away, but I'm sure we would be rescued by a ship on the way.
On a ship, you're the skipper... so you give the orders, which is fine by me.
This really isn't a ship anymore... just a house on land.
Yoshida!
It's time you two stop running things!
Who are you to judge?
If you have a better idea, why don't you tell us?!
We shouldn't argue!
Everyone will have to do their share so we can get out of this.
The women will get the water.
You can go hunting if you want.
Whoever doesn't work on the boat should make an S.O.S. fire on top of one of the mountains.
I understand.
You take an awful lot of notes.
I'm glad I don't work that hard.
I use the thoughts of those I hire.
That's what takes talent.
There's nothing wrong with borrowing talent.
It takes ability as well as intelligence.
You're right.
Civilization has progressed by borrowing.
Each generation takes an idea and improves it.
Novelists do the same thing, right?
Your table is over here.
She's decided to come with us.
I'd like to come along.
We've walked a distance and haven't seen anything yet.
Weren't all the mirrors on the ship missing?
I wonder why they would bring them up here to break them?
There must be a reason.
Why'd he do that?
Do you think he saw us?
No. It seemed like he was avoiding the island.
Hey, that's not good.
The birds won't come near this island?
Sakuda!
Over there!
This island is a ship's graveyard.
Maybe it's the current.
It drags them off course, and they smash against the rocks.
Idiot!
Don't call me an idiot.
I came over here to help you.
Let's go.
Mushrooms.
I'd take a chance with them if i was starving.
Hey...
Hey, it was around here.
I'm sure I saw something.
Did we imagine it?
What? There's nobody here?
Hey!
What?
Someone's looking in here.
Who is it?
You can't trust any of the men around here!
This will fix him if he tries again.
What's the matter?
Something's wrong with the batteries.
Who is it?
You heard it?
Yokoyama.
Yokoyama!
Was that you?
I don't know.
Where did you go just now?
I don't need your permission to use the bathroom!
Who's there?
It's us.
What is this?
We're sure someone's walking on the deck.
Could it be Kasai?
Who are you?! Stay away!
What happened, Kasai?
What happened? What's the matter?
Hey!
Yokoyama! Yoshida! Wake up!
What's wrong with all of you?
In Tokyo, you guys know how to get around.
But on this ship you've become idiots... seeing ghosts in your head and believing it's haunted!
There's a reason for this, and I know what it is.
It's these women.
They're on your mind all the time and you can't do anything about it!
That's what's wrong with everyone.
It gets to me too, and drives me crazy!
Tonight,
I may just do something with you.
Are you men going to let him behave this way?
None of them seem to give a damn.
Damn!
- I'll kill you!
- Come on!
- Stop it!
- Let go!
That's enough of this!
Something else about her... she goes into the jungle with the writer quite a lot.
Seems they're carrying more than just water.
What do you know of my affairs?!
Hey... she's not denying it!
I know what woman Mami is.
I don't need you to tell me.
He's right.
I used you to get one thing.
Europe is what I wanted, not you.
I've always found you repulsive.
What?
Stop This !
Yokoyama, are you sure we saw a ghost?
What do you think?
Come here.
Yoshida, you too.
I suppose that's our imagination.
Let's stop fighting each other.
We have to find food and fix the yacht so we can get away.
Is that all you've got to say?
All he's done is carry that gun around, and what can he show for it?
- Hey!
- Yeah, let me finish!
There's a lot of grass growing around here.
You can eat the roots!
You can eat the roots of a lot of plants!
You never thought of that, did you?!
What have you brought back for us?
You!
In Tokyo you use your head to make money... but it's not worth a damn here!
Here you have to work, so get to work if you want to eat!
Hey!
College professor... writer... you have to go out searching regardless if it's raining or not!
A miracle won't fall out of the sky!
Just because it's raining doesn't mean that we stop working!
You don't mind getting wet when you're swimming, this shouldn't be any different!
Akiko... Akiko!
Akiko... it's mother.
I'm stopping.
Even if we fix the ship, we can't leave without food.
I'm going to look for some.
What are you looking at?
What are you doing?
What's it look like?
I wonder who stole the food from us the other night?
I suppose the ghost stole the key and got into the locker.
Oh, that. It's too bad
I couldn't hold on to him.
You liar!
Where did you get the idea to show us empty cans and claim some ghost did it?
We knew it was you who did it all along, but we wanted to stop another argument.
You're pretty good at finding fault in others, but you better watch your own steps.
What are you doing?
Don't worry.
I'm going to hunt down the monster that everyone saw.
Yoshida, you can't do that!
We don't know if it's a man!
He could be a survivor of the ship!
I hope that it is a man so I can have a talk with him.
I'll be very interested to hear what he says.
A man thinks strange things when he's out of his mind.
His reality may be more interesting than ours, and it wouldn't matter what he ate.
Yoshida!
We didn't get much after working all day.
But we worked hard and did as much as we could.
You're right.
Sakuda!
Knock before you come in.
I'll hold onto these.
We can't trust you.
You'll sleep with the rest of us tonight.
I sleep better when I'm alone.
You're going to work like everyone too!
Bastard!
Who in the world helped you when your brother was ill?
I put you in college and gave you a job in my company!
That's right.
I thought you were my friend, but you were just using me too!
Great!
Then how about these?
What eggs are those?
Turtle, the top of the line.
There's two for each, 14 in all.
You don't get any if you're empty-handed.
I don't care,
I'm not hungry anymore.
Hey, did you eat some of those mushrooms?
Well, I wonder...
Anyway, don't make anything for me.
Alright, I'll give you •10,000 each.
It's not enough.
Yesterday you charged •5000 each!
The market for eggs won't last for long.
Alright... •200,000, okay?
It's a gamble.
Will I be able to use it or not?
I'll do my best to get off this island, even if I have to kill everyone here to do it!
So that's your game, you bastard!
You bastard!
I'll kill you!
- Come on!
Sakuda!
Hey! Stop it!
- Stop it!
- Yoshida!
Stop it now!
He was with her.
Is this about jealousy?
We agreed to leave them alone.
You had no right to fight!
All of them want me.
I'll kill you all.
He's mad!
I ate some mushrooms. Now you know.
I read a long time ago that mexicans ate them in order to increase their perception and gain a sense of well being.
Don't move!
Japanese legends mention laughing mushrooms, so I'm in good company.
The people who gathered them danced in high spirits on the mountains and were in touch with the gods.
Matango, according to your thinking, means a person no longer human.
That's fine by me.
Because when I kill you,
I won't be commiting any crime.
I understand.
We won't stand in your way.
Do anything you like.
I will.
The truth is...
I like Akiko better than Mami, so after you're all dead...
Let me go!
Get up!
Move!
What's wrong?
Get in!
Hey!
What's the matter?
You're going to start living with the rest of us!
Sakuda!
It looks good.
You've done a lot to the yacht.
- Isn't it ready to go yet?
- Are you going to help?
Yes, in any way.
The truth is, can I talk to you?
What do you plan to do now that everything is different?
Hey, are you listening to me?
Yes.
There's 24 cans of food left.
Not much.
But for two people... maybe ten days.
Hey, how about the two of us leaving?
If we had potatoes and seaweed, we could last for weeks!
There's plenty of water.
I'm sure the two of us could stay alive for at least three weeks or so!
We could be found by a ship, or maybe find another island.
Get out!
I see.
The weak restraints of society disintegrate in the face of the will to survive in harsh circumstances.
The worse things get here, the worst we behave.
Is there a way to change everyone's feelings?
They made a mess here, huh ?
What happened, Kasai?
It's Sakuda!
He stole the canned food and left!
Damn!
Damn! He's gone!
I guess he didn't think any of us were worth saving.
I don't think he ever had a high opinion of us, but now that doesn't make any difference.
It's my turn to do something.
Mami, bring the girl over here.
- Bastard!
- No! Let go! Let me go!
I'm going to kill you both.
Start walking down the deck and don't try anything funny.
Teacher!
I wonder how many times I wrote something like this in my novels?
Yokoyama!
Get out of here!
- Kasai...
- You too!
Please, I beg you!
You wanted to be with him, get going!
I bet this didn't happen in your damn books!
Stop it!
It's been raining for a week now.
It must be it's raining season.
If you're right, we won't be able to live here very long.
Do you know anywhere else we can go?
We'll have to find a place.
Maybe we can find a cave.
Morai...
I'm finished... I can't go on.
Kasai, no matter how we feel, we can't give up.
How can we live if we do nothing?!
Stop it!
I wish you'd hurry and kill me.
I don't even have the courage to kill myself.
Don't say such things!
Anyway, relax for today.
He's right.
You rest here while we go out.
We're tough enough to survive, and so are you.
Let's go.
Mami!
You're still alive! How did you do it?
I haven't been hungry since I left.
Mami... help me! I beg you!
I've waited a long time for that... you begging for help.
Now you know how it feels to be desperate for help.
I'll help you... we'll go together.
The rainfall is making the mushrooms big and strong with each pitter-patter.
Where is the food?
A little further.
Walk this way.
It's delicious.
We should have eaten them sooner.
I should have told you that once you eat the mushrooms, you become a mushroom.
That's why all of the mirrors on the ship were removed.
But once you eat them, you can't stop.
Yoshida!
Kasai!
He's not here.
Teacher!
We're not beaten. We're not beaten!
Hey!
Sakuda!
Masoko Kasai, Kenji Morai,
Etsuro Yoshida,
Senzo Yokoyama,
Mami Sekimuchi, Akiko Soma...
These people are stranded on a deserted Island.
I went out on this ship to try and find some help, but I couldn't make it and died out at sea.
Captain Aoyuki Sakuda.
Damn!
I found the yacht.
The yacht?!
Then, Sakuda came back ?
Sakuda died at sea.
The yacht drifted back here.
Then no one has ever left this island, huh?
Is this all you could find this morning ?
I couldn't find anything !
Hey... we could eat these mushrooms.
You'd turn into a mushroom!
But...
- Mami and Kasai seem to...
- Idiot!
They're already half-mushroom!
That's alright.
If there's a way off this Island, perhaps it's the only way to live...
I shouldn't have done that.
Teacher... I can't do it!
I can't behave like you!
I can't! I can't do it!
I wish I were dead!
Akiko... we're not going to become mushrooms!
Teacher...!
We'll do it... right?
We'll spend the day... no... we'll get all the food that we can carry and get off this island!
Teacher!
Akiko!
Teacher!
Where are you? Akiko!
- Teacher!
- Akiko!
- Akiko!
- Teacher!
They're delicious! It's true!
Idiot! Let's go!
Teacher!
Then, the night came... and the morning came... and the night came again...
I don't remember when i was rescued.
But, now I'm sorry that I was.
If I was really in love with Akiko,
I should have eaten the mushrooms with her and become one.
At least we would have been together.
Isn't that it?
If I really wanted to live,
I shouldn't have been so stupid and eaten one.
With all the pain... all the suffering... all my sadness... would have disappeared by eating them!
How in the world can i face myself?!
No, no. You should consider yourself fortunate.
You were found and brought home.
Is that so?
Tokyo is not very different from that island.
People in the city are just as cruel, aren't they?
It's all the same.
I would have been happier on the island.
Transcript/Timing : aRKhaNe
Turn it off!
- Who are you?
- Put that away. I'm not the enemy.
I don't know who the enemy is.
- What's your name?
- Jeff Nolan.
Watch your hands!
Get his wallet, Peggy.
- Sorry.
- That's all right.
- Hmm. You're an American?
- That's right.
- I'm Quinn Taggart. This is my wife, Peggy.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- I have to be careful with her along.
A farmer fired at us with a shotgun.
None of us know who our friends are.
- You seen anyone else?
- No one.
- Where did you come from?
- The south. It's the same all over.
- Do you know what's happened?
- No, I don't.
I took a plane up this morning for a shakedown flight... and when I went up everything was normal.
When I came down, everyone was dead.
I drove all day.
You're the first folks I've seen alive.
What's an American doing testing planes here?
It's sort of a joint project...
Britain, Canada and us.
A vertical-rising jet. I sit in for our team.
Where were you folks when everything stopped?
I was in a hospital... in an oxygen tent.
- What was the matter?
- I'm all right now.
But when nobody came, I got up by myself... and everyone was dead.
I think I'll just have a look round the back here.
Could I have a drink, please?
Hmm? Oh, sure.
What'll you have?
Oh, whiskey will be fine.
That's fine. Thank you.
Here's to you, Mrs. Taggart.
I'm not Mrs. Taggart.
He said it would be safer if we told people that.
- You're not married?
- Mm-mmm.
I was married. My husband died last year.
My name's Peggy Haddon.
- You never met Taggart before then.
- No.
Yes, I could do with a drink.
What's north of here?
Same as south... nothing.
- What are your plans?
- Well, there must be some people left... accidents like ourselves... and they'll head for the nearest town.
I thought I might hang around for a day or so and see if anyone showed up.
- Why?
- If we intend to survive,
- we'll need all the help we can get.
- You're kidding yourself, Nolan.
What happened earlier this morning, that was no accident.
Whoever did it has won the war.
All they've got to do is to move in and take over.
And then it's every man for himself.
Cheers.
Small world, my friend.
I thought you were dead!
Maybe... Maybe we all are.
Vi!
Vi, we've got company.
- I'm Ed... I'm Ed Otis.
- Jeff Nolan.
This is Vi... Violet Courtland.
Oh, I am pleased to see you.
Eddie and I didn't know what to do.
We were scared to death.
That's why we hid in the grocer's.
- I said, "At least we'd be able to eat."
- Let's get to the hotel.
- There's some others there too.
- Then it is just a local thing.
- I knew I was right.
- We'd better go. Come along.
- Here we are.
- Thank you. You're a dear.
Now then. Now Otis is buying.
What is your pleasure? Vi?
No more, Eddie love.
Can't I sweeten your tea for you, love?
Oh, it's not like you to turn down a drink. Oh, well. Cheers.
You know, I haven't a thing to wear.
I hope things don't go back to normal until I can get a proper wardrobe.
I don't think things will be normal for quite a while.
Then you do know something about it. I thought you did.
Let me ask you a question.
Where were you when all this happened?
At our company party...
25th anniversary of Chempex Limited.
Oh, and nothing happened to anyone else at the party?
You see, Vi and I, we kind of sneaked away.
She was feeling a bit under the weather.
So we went into one of the labs where they have a sofa there... in case any of the staff want to stay overnight.
- He didn't ask for your life history, love.
- In the morning they were gone.
- What kind of a lab?
- Oh, just a lab... cultures.
Well, then the air is treated to prevent contamination.
Well, I don't see what business this is of yours.
Just this: You and Otis were in a lab with treated ventilation.
Peggy was in a hospital under an oxygen tent.
I was in a plane on an altitude test. That...
- Where were you, Taggart?
- What you're trying to say is
- it was a gas attack, right?
- That's right, a gas attack.
Then why weren't we all killed when we came out into the air?
Well, it rained yesterday quite heavily.
If the gas was soluble in water then that could've saved us.
Oh, there was a funny smell... mushrooms.
Can't get anything else on this whole damn dial!
Otis, you're familiar with this area.
Did you ever hear that sound?
No.
It seems to be in all the bands at that frequency... even the television.
But who spread the gas?
Surely you could get them on that.
You're welcome to try, my dear lady.
I can't get any other country.
Not even a ship. Nothing.
- What's the matter?
- That's a lie! The ships are all right!
Now... Now don't... don't worry, Vi.
Don't worry.
- He's all right.
- Take your hands off me.
- Her son's at sea.
- Take your hands off me, Eddie!
What's the use of an army or an air force?
I haven't seen a plane since... since it happened.
Oh, they've come!
Oh, thank God! I'll go and tell them we're here. It's the air force.
Vi! Vi, come back here! Vi!
Stop!
Stop!
Please don't go away!
There's more of us over at the hotel.
Oh, please, don't go away.
Stop.
They're space suits.
I don't recognize 'em.
Stop! Stop!
We're over here. I'll show you.
You better stay here. Come on, Taggart.
She's dead.
- She's dead.
- I'll help you. Better get her inside.
You and I made a bargain.
Staying in a crowd's no good.
The sooner we get out of here the better.
I'm not going with you.
- You better park this.
- Is that an order, sir?
Over by the sports car.
I'm Jeff Nolan.
I'm Lorna Brainard, and this is my husband, Mel.
We better get to the hotel.
It's warmer inside.
- Nice car you're driving.
- Yeah. Found it.
Come on in by the fire.
Now look. We've got to get cracking.
I'm taking her to her mother's.
- Where's that?
- Liverpool.
- Where'd you come from yesterday?
- London.
I don't think you'll find it any different.
You think there's something out there?
We know there's something out there.
That's all we need... a cheeky kid and a pregnant girl.
They're probably the most important people on earth right now.
Where were you yesterday when it hit?
We don't even know what it was.
I just don't understand it.
- Look, what difference does it make?
- Well, I don't mind telling you.
- Lorna!
- Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of.
A year ago, Mel and I ran up to London. We got married.
We weren't doing very well. My mother wrote and told us we could go and stay with her... at least till the baby was born.
All right, if you want everyone to know our business.
We started north without any money.
The first night we, uh, broke into this air-raid shelter and slept there.
When we came out the next day, everyone was dead.
We think it was a gas attack.
This air-raid shelter was probably equipped to prevent air contamination...
- from fallout and radiation.
- I wouldn't know.
If it was a gas attack, who did it?
- How about that, Professor?
- We don't know.
We can't raise anybody or anything on the shortwave... and as far as we're concerned, it's no country on earth.
Oh, maybe those little men from Mars are back again.
They're real enough and big enough!
They killed Vi!
Look... You mean you've actually seen these things?
- Two men in space suits.
- Yeah, but at least they're men.
I emptied this in one of them, and he walked away.
Have you got men like that where you come from?
Well, why are we all standing here talking?
Vi's dead upstairs, and those things are still outside.
We're gonna get out of here.
You'd be better off if we stick together.
Otis, you know this area pretty well.
Where can we find some weapons to defend ourselves?
Well, there's a drill hall east of the village.
I don't know what you'll find there.
They use it mainly for meetings and civil defense and so on.
Let's go see what they have.
We'll go in my car.
- Now mind how you go, Lorna.
- Oh, dear.
That's it. Out you come.
Ooh.
- Well, maybe you could break the lock.
- No, we may need it.
- There must be another way in.
- Now let me try it.
Here.
That does it.
- Be my guest. It's worth a chance.
- Let's have a look around.
- Just a few cots.
- They're only drill rifles. No firing pins.
Mel, toss me a rifle.
You find any rifles?
No rifles, but they've got some workable automatics here.
- Here's some ammo.
- One, two, three, four. Testing.
- One, two, three, four. Testing.
- Mel. Mel.
- Otis. Otis, come on.
- I don't even know how to use these things.
- Just put the bullets in here like that.
- Hmm?
Close the breech.
Safety catch. Now you know.
Maybe you were right, Mel. Perhaps we should try and get back to Liverpool.
We can't walk out on them now, can we?
- Let's get back to the hotel.
- But, Mel, we...
- Hmm.
- Thank you.
And if you had gone back to the States, what would you have done?
Oh, I had a lot of problems that I thought were pretty important then.
I passed the age for flying, and the company wanted to give me a desk job-test planning.
- You didn't want a desk job?
- Mm-mmm. No, it wasn't that.
I just reached one of those turning points... where I thought I might take some inventory of myself.
Those problems were solved the hard way.
Ooh, time for the changing of the guard.
I better get Otis. See you both later.
Oh, honey.
Aw, there.
Somebody might get killed if you don't stay awake.
My doctor says I'm taking the same chance with this.
- Why drink if it's gonna kill ya?
- Well, I don't normally.
Just occasional drink at a party.
What difference does it make now?
Makes all the difference in the world.
You're needed now.
You know, I think you're whistling in the dark, Nolan.
We're never, never going to get out of this wretched village.
- Who's that?
- Taggart.
Getting a bit nippy out there.
- See anything?
- No, all quiet.
There's an old stable which might keep off some of the wind.
Well, I'll... I'll get my coat.
I'll take over for Mel.
Hmm.
I've got your dinner warming in the oven. I'll get it for you.
Good. I could use it.
- What's the matter with Otis?
- Oh, he's just plain scared.
Trying to drink himself to death.
- Can't really blame him.
- I can.
- As long as there's a chance.
- Maybe he thinks there isn't.
- Haven't you ever felt that way?
- No, and I don't think I ever will.
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Well, maybe I'm just lucky.
What have you got in there?
I'll show you.
- Mel!
- Where'd you get those?
At the bank. They've got a special today.
All you want for nothing. Help yourself.
Oh, Mel, you shouldn't take it... even if it isn't worth anything.
Why not?
Absolutely useless.
You can't eat it. You can't wear it.
You can't even write on it.
You know, it's funny.
Three days ago, I'd have done anything for that much money.
Anything... blown up a building, committed murder.
Oh, yes, I would. You don't know.
I wanted money so bad I could taste it.
This would've been for a house.
This would've been for a car.
Decent clothes for you. Clothes for me.
A telly, a washing machine, furniture... good furniture.
A place to go on a holiday. Cruise.
That was a week ago.
When I needed it, I couldn't get it.
What the devil's the use of it now?
Don't do that!
Wha...
- I... I don't understand.
- She came at me. I shot her. They all saw it.
You didn't have to shoot her! Aah! Aah!
Let him alone!
- You said that she was dead.
- She was.
She was alive enough tonight... except her eyes.
Well, what was the matter with them?
She hasn't got any eyes, just gray blobs.
She walked right at me.
She couldn't have been alive.
How do you think she got down here?
Anybody carry her?
She walked, my friend.
She was alive, all right.
When I shot her, she fell down and she bled just like anybody else.
- What do you think now, Professor?
- Hmm?
We better get back to the drill hall for tonight. We'll head south in the morning.
Those of us who want to go south.
- What do you want to do? Vote on it?
- Oh, forget the votes, Nolan.
And majority of rule, law and order.
There aren't any rules.
There aren't any orders.
We can make any kind of world we like.
What are we arguing for?
Let's get out of here.
All right. Mel, you and Otis get some food. We'll take all the cars.
- Peggy.
- Yes?
- Take care of Lorna, will you?
- Yes, I will.
It'll be daylight in about an hour or so.
Better all try and get some rest.
We'll leave as soon as we can.
- I'll finish out the watch.
- Let me help you with it.
- Suit yourself.
- How about me?
You better stay with your wife. Oh, Mel, take that radio back in the storage room, will you?
Sure.
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.
Which side do you want?
- You take the back.
- Anything you want, Professor.
Well, where is Jeff?
- What's the matter?
- Well, he's tucked away safe enough.
We're leaving. They're going south.
We're going north.
- No, we are not!
- Oh, yes, we are.
- You haven't killed him, have you?
- No, not yet.
One peep out of you, it could be arranged.
- Go to that car.
- But I...
Oh, get on!
- You all right, Jeff?
- I don't know.
Let's get you inside.
Ooh, my head.
Where do you think you're going?
You must get me a coat or a sweater.
I'm absolutely freezing.
Stay in that car.
I'll get you something further up.
Stay here.
Peggy!
Peggy!
Peggy.
Peggy.
Peggy! I have no time to play.
You're just making it rough on yourself.
- Ooh.
- There. Almost as good as new.
- Ooh.
- Thanks, Lorna.
Look, if you feel up to it,
I think we ought to get out of here.
I'm going back to the village first.
But they're miles away by now.
There's a chance they might have stopped there.
Get everybody ready to go, and if I'm not back in 30 minutes... leave without me.
Stay where you are! Stay!
What happened to Taggart?
He's gone.
It's a machine, a robot.
A few things begin to make sense.
Well, nothing makes any sense to me.
What about them?
What are they? What did they want?
They're human slaves to these machines.
Violet was dead, wasn't she?
This must be some sort of a shock attack.
They paralyze all the bodily functions and then reactivate them.
Sightless and mindless slaves.
What would they do if they got away?
I don't know. Without any mind or any intelligence at all, uh, they'd be worse than animals.
We'd better be the ones that get away.
Come on.
We'd better go in.
What if they've left?
I told them to go without me if I wasn't back in a half hour.
Oh, thank God you've come. Lorna needs you.
- Jeff, I don't know what to do.
- How is she?
- She's in a lot of pain.
- Jeff, you'd better get in here.
- What can I do?
- Come here.
Soon as the baby's born, we've gotta get out of here as fast as we can.
Mel, you and Otis drive down to the village... and get everything you think a baby might need.
- Be as quick as you can, but be careful.
- But, Jeff...
Relax, Mel. It isn't the first time this has happened.
Get me some safety pins. Get me some diapers.
Come on, Otis.
Oh, Jeff, I... I don't know anything about delivering a baby.
- You soon will.
- I wish I had your confidence.
I do too.
- How is she?
- Oh, she... she's coming along fine.
Oh. My goodness.
All that for one small baby.
You better keep it outside.
- Thanks for the help, Otis.
- All right.
I wouldn't go back there... not for all the tea in China.
Well, we can't stay here. It isn't safe.
Well, she can't be moved.
- Where she goes, the baby goes too, you know.
- I know. I know.
- She might be all right tomorrow.
- Tonight is what I'm worried about.
- Well... did you meet your daughter?
- Yeah. She snubbed me.
- Look, I don't know how to thank you.
- Oh.
When I look at that baby,
I should thank you for letting me help.
Hey, Jeff, did you see that thing in the village? It's some sort of machine.
Yeah. Yeah. We... We saw it.
- By the way, uh, where's Otis?
- Oh, he turned chicken.
I think he's in the storeroom.
Otis.
Otis. Where...
Otis. Come on. Wake up.
Otis. Come on, boy. Up and at 'em!
- Dead drunk.
- That's a great help.
Get the radio, Mel.
- I'll go check up on Lorna.
- All right, Peggy.
You didn't get a chance to hear it, Mel, but that's the same sound that the robots give off.
You mean, you think they're being directed by a transmitter?
You see, our own space program has robot devices designed for use on the moon and Mars.
They'll telecast their findings back to us and send pictures.
They don't look like, uh, spacemen, but it's the same principle.
Yeah. But how could they land a transmitter here?
I don't think they did. I think they're using one of ours as a booster.
Phew.
If we could wreck it, we could put them out of commission... at least round here.
Without the beam they'd just be dead hunks of machinery.
That's right, if the, uh, theory's correct.
And how do we find the transmitter?
With this and a piece of copper wire.
Well, you better pick up that walkie-talkie so we can keep in touch with Peggy.
Sure.
When you reach the lowest volume... the transmitter should be in a direct line with the plane of the antenna.
You take a reading and enter it on the map.
Then you drive a ways and take another reading.
Then a third about here.
Where the three lines intersect should be our transmitter. See how it's done?
Yes, it's the same way they used to track down amateur wireless sets...
- that were causing interference, isn't it?
- That's right.
- Jeff.
- Here. Let me have it.
- Jeff.
- We've just taken the first reading.
Everything all right there? Over.
It's quiet as a tomb here. Lorna's sleeping.
How long will you be, Jeff?
We'll be back as soon as we can.
Over and out.
If my readings are correct, the transmitter should be down that road.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Jeff.
Jeff!
Jeff.
- Jeff.
- Peggy. Peggy!
- The robots.
- What?
Peggy!
Let it go.
Taggart!
- Oh, Jeff!
- Peggy. Are you all right?
- Yes.
- I don't understand how you stopped them.
We blew up the transmission tower. Without the signal they're just so much machinery.
Do you think it's safe now?
- Maybe there are other towers.
- I don't know. Maybe there are.
But the main thing is we know how to stop them now, wherever they are.
Unless they try to use gas again.
There's always been that chance, and there always will be.
Let's see the baby. Come on.
Have you seen my baby daughter?
She slept through everything.
She's a very important young lady.
All of a sudden people mean something again.
When can we leave? We might find a doctor.
As soon as you're up to it. We'll drive to the airport and take one of the planes.
Whatever people are left will see the plane and... follow it south.
Mitsuki, don't cry.
He's our only son.
He's just a boy.
Remember, Mitsuki, you haven't lost a son, you've won a daugther.
My only daugter, and I hope the boy will be a good husband to her.
I'm sure he will.
Dry your tears.
And when will the lovely
Soon-a be married?
I don't know, but I'm in no particular hurry, thank you.
I hear rumors about you and Il-woo.
That would be like falling in love with a computer, almost.
Excuse me.
I must be going.
Oh, must you?
We were expecting you for lunch.
Another time.
Il-woo, I'm afraid I've been rater nasty to you.
You couldn't be.
I do have a lot of research still to do, tought.
Te familiar apology of te dedicated scienthist.
But you have to draw te line somewere, you know.
Your father was equally dedicated, but he died of overwork.
Neverteless, I must go.
Excuse me.
He's going to be as famous as is father was.
Why do scienthists act as tough the only important work in the world is what they're up to?
All he ever talks to me about... is is stupid work.
And I must say I don't get alf of it.
I think he makes it up on is own.
But he doesn't know I'm not always impressed by scienthists anyway.
I think that boy's going to go crazy, and very soon.
Soona, don't be unkind.
Il-woo's very talented.
One of these days you're going to see
Il-woo at te head of his profession.
He's a wonderfully gifted lad.
Why must you always stand up for him like that?
Your father's decided to like Il-woo, just in case
- He becomes one of the family later.
- Oh, mother.
- Shall we go eat?
- Yes, let's.
Good idea.
I wonder why little Ico didn't come?
Oh, well, you know how children are.
He's forgetful, all right.
All boys are.
But he wanted to show us that little surprise he had for us.
He will.
What is it?
I don't know.
My skin, it's hitching so.
Hum?
What the...
Well, this is one hell of a way to start a honeymoon.
- What got into you two?
- I don't know.
This light started to shine on us and we just started to hitch all over.
- You started to hitch?
- From over there.
- I think I know what's going on.
- Well, what?
- Come on out.
- Who are you talking to?
Come out of there, Ico!
- Well, I'll be...
- Ico, What a surprise.
What have you got behind your back, young man?
- It's nothing.
- Here, give that to me.
- What is it?
- Just a toy.
Hey, you two are going to be late.
You'd better hurry.
You're right. Let's go.
Bye.
Monster.
Have fun.
Come on, Ico.
- Where'd you get that, as if I didn't know?
- In your lab, as if you didn't know.
Didn't your mother ever teach you not to shoplift?
Sure, but it was my surprise wedding gift.
Well, quite a surprise.
Don't you realize they almost scratched temselves to death?
Yeah, but you gotta admit it was kinda funny.
Yes, Ico, I guess it was.
My boy, that ligth ray is experimental.
That's What I thougt it was, Il-woo, so I experimented.
Now you can put in your notebook that it works perfectly on newlyweds.
Thank you, Einstein, but I was serious.
You mustn't play around.
We've found out that the ligth ray causes severe hitcing.
But there can be side effects.
Understand?
We've been investigating it.
I'll bet you never realized you could harm your sister and her new husband.
So, from now on, just leave things where you find them, all right?
All right.
All right.
Over there.
- There.
- Now, come here.
Look, you can play with these instead.
Hey, those are terrific.
I must've dozed.
Boy, I'm really tired tonigth.
You can sleep afterwards.
You're not going to be a nagging wife, now, are you, my dear?
I bore you already.
Looks like our marriage is doomed.
No, that happens wenever I get married.
I get tense.
You were smiling.
And, really, I don't know ow you can be tense and smile all at one time.
It's easy at weddings.
Especially when marrying the world's loveliest girl.
Let's not talk politics now.
Now, sweeheart...
If that subject doesn't interest you, this might.
That's just my father at the control center.
I'm sure he thinks he's very funny.
- Yes, sir?
- This is headquarters, son.
Do you need me, sir?
That's right, and immediately,
I'm afraid.
Reconnaissance job, my boy.
A rocket is being readied.
What is it all about, sir?
There seems to be... some kind of nuclear test somewere in te Middle East.
We want a monitor on it.
We'll need you here within an hour.
Very well, sir.
Please get someone else, can't you?
He's supposed to be here tonight.
I'm sorry, dear. It's a pity.
He's te only one who can handle it.
It'll last two days.
We'll get him a two-week vacation when he returns, all right?
I guess so.
There's apparently no choice.
Nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two,
one, zero l'am now over the target area.
Good. fire retro-stabilizers and commence reconnaissance.
Would you come here, sir?
I can't get trough to te capsule.
Something's gone wrong with the radio.
Capsule, capsule, come in, capsule.
Hello?
Come in, please.
Control tower, come in, please come in.
- Come in, capsule. Capsule...
- Oh, please, can't you do anything?
We're doing all we can, dear.
Capsule, capsule...
Here is the latest news bulletin
reports from korea's rocket control center indicate
that after a perfect takeoff and a flawless entry into orbit,
our rocket number 7-x,
at present on a routine reconnaissance flight,
has developed some radio trouble
this, however, is not causing too much worry
and the experts are in hopes of clearing it ap momentarily
Capsule, capsule, capsule, come in.
Come in, please. Capsule, come in.
Capsule, come in.
What do you think is the matter with him?
Where is he?
If it's only someting wrong with is radio, don't worry too much.
He'll have little difficulty landing the craft.
Te only problem will be that we won't know where.
He migth even land in the ocean.
We'll do all we can.
Control tower, do you read me?
Over
Control tower, come in, please.
Reading you loud and clear, capsule.
Go ahead, capsule.
Capsule, we read you.
Where've you been all this time?
Listen.
I'm so glad he got through.
Prepare rocket for landing.
Use manual de-orbiting.
Position yourself with the rear stabilizers.
Time retro-rockets for landing zone two.
Roger, re-entry at landing zone two.
Very unusual, an earthquake in that area.
An earthquake?
I thought they were just in Japan.
Not true, Ico.
In any case, we do have a large earth movement here.
Sir, there's someting a bit unusual going on here.
Would you take a look, please?
Sir, we have triangalated...
the epicenter of the earthquake.
The epicenter is shifting.
It's moving rapidly in a straight line.
How?
And if we extend this line in the direction of movement,
it points directly to the heart of Korea. we have no choice but to call an alert.
Get me H-Two.
Capsule, come in!
This is capsule.
Land your craft immediately.
Change perspective for zone 10.
Oh, look! There!
He's coming down.
He made it. It's all right.
Let's go.
A perfect landing.
- That's te best one yet, I think.
- Yes, it was.
We'd better get over there.
B Post, B Post, this is 6-M.
This is 6-M.
The capsule is on te ground.
The landing was successful.
Welcome. Welcome.
- Good landing.
- Congratulations.
Oh, darling.
I'm here, too.
I think you were just wonderful.
Te eartquake's moving, sir.
I thought so.
In what direction?
- To te norteast.
- Well, now what?
It looks like everyone is agreed on one important point, gentlemen, and that is that this earthquake, or earth movement, is defying every natural law that man knows.
It seems to me you're exaggerating. this is nothing more than a tremor.
I don't agree with you.
We ave an earth movement.
We don't know how it started, and we don't know how to stop it.
I hope, gentlemen, you will allow me a word.
I admit that my point of view is strictly military.
Consequently,
I believe in having cards on the table.
The moment for teorizing, I think, is over now.
We're positive of one thing only.
There's an earthquake heading towards the center of our country.
That's why we're here.
And when this heartquake gets here, it's going to bring disaster.
That is, unless we can get ourselves ready for it.
Well, there you have it, as clear as day.
Now, What are we going to do about it?
A clear statement.
However, I greatly fear that science cannot help.
We're as mystified as everybody.
But we cannot just sit and wait.
Now, we must start in preparing.
At least we have a few hours' time to try to minimize te danger, and the damage that we know are bound to occur soon.
We must declare a state of emergency and martial law.
I'm sure you're right, General.
So we'll begin all preparations and be ready for trouble, but I think it better that we call no alert until we're sure te earthquake will it.
- This came trough just now, sir.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen, the United Nations as just announced that they will help us.
An expert team of scientists as been ordered to come to Korea.
They sould be here within a few hours.
It's Hwangae.
According to the board, the heartquake is now hitting close to te Hwangae province.
There's no time for speaches.
Well, it's beginning to look like you were right, General.
I autorize you to impose martial law immediately.
This is an emergency announcement.
this is an emergency announcement.
An earthqaake is imminent in this area.
Stop whatever you are doing and return home.
Martial law has been declared.
Return to your homes at once.
I repeat, return to your homes at once.
listen to your radio for further instructions.
- An earthqake will be hitting this area.
- An earthquake.
We'd better go.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is an emergency announcement.
An earthqaake is expected in this area.
Do not panic repeat, do not panic.
Mother, I'm so scared.
I know. Just don't forget your father.
He'll find something.
- There. Do you see it?
- Another degree. More.
Down one, and across...
About five.
Hurry! Hurry up!
What could that thing have been?
What does it want?
Where'll it it next?
It migth stop before it gets any closer.
That would be very pleasant, but don't count on it.
You know, this earthquake reminds me of someting I heard a long time ago.
When I was a child, my grandparents used to tell me fables about a monster.
He was connected with earthquakes.
- Yongary?
- That's te one.
Sir, we found this man three miles from the earthquake center.
Look, please...
- What's that?
- It's Yongary.
The mysterious moving earthquake...
has been identified as being caused by a gigantic reptile
this monster, Yongary, has already been responsible
for several deaths and great damages
all citizens are advised to stay in their homes
our armed forces are making
all necessary preparations to deal with the monster
This is Patrol Six.
Come in.
You see anything over there?
Not yet.
At ease, men.
- Anything to report?
- No, sir.
Headquarters. Headquarters.
This is Car Two. Do you read me?
There's a strange disturbance here at Inwang.
I don't understand what's going on.
An explosion at high altitude.
The mountain is going to blow up!
It looks like Yongary wasn't a myth after all.
So, General, I suggest you get a few tanks over tere.
Yongary's coming out!
So, we must now alter all our plans and evacuate.
I want to see every single living human out of this town by sun up tomorrow morning.
And furthermore,
I want several brigades out on te streets.
They're going to aid the people.
And the rest of the army on tank maneuvers.
Good. I think we have three tank divisions available.
The monster yongary has been reported in the Inwang area.
All citizens are ordered to evacuate the city.
Number 13!
Battalion, withdraw tanks!
Il-woo, where are you going?
Il-woo, What are you going to do?
I'm going to see that monster.
- You can't.
- Oh, no.
The warning's out.
You've got to stay away from there.
You know it could be terribly dangerous.
Now we've got to get out.
- Come on, Il-woo!
- No, just a minute.
Nobody knows what to do this time.
Neither the generals, nor the so-called politicians.
If I can help,
I've got to see him first.
Well, in my opinion, you're just committing suicide.
Anyway, you were never a hero before, so what makes you think you have to be one this time?
She's right.
Please don't go, Il-woo.
Don't you worry.
I have to go. I'll be all right.
I'll go, too.
- Ico!
- Ico, no, come back! Please!
Ico, where do you think you're going?
I'll bring them back.
You wait here.
Ico. Il-woo.
Repent! All you sinners, repent!
The Lord say's repent!
The Lord say's repent!
Seek ye repentance and ye sall be saved!
Repent, you sinners!
- Pass te beer.
- This is good.
Try some soy sauce.
Down the hatch.
Haven't you heard?
The monster's heading this way.
We'd better all run to te hills now!
And what are we supposed to do if the monster comes to the hills?
Head back to town?
- Go get yourself a cab.
- I don't want to meet that monster.
And I'm sure he won't die of a broken heart if he doesn't get to meet me.
Goodbye, everybody.
- Why, you miserable...
- You know someting, Ito?
What this place needs is a couple of waiters who know how to draw beer.
Ico! Il-woo!
Ico, get back here!
Il-woo, Iook!
He's pretty big, he?
Come back!
You could get killed here! Hurry!
Ico, get up.
- Come on, Soona!
- Come on, come on!
Please, Il-woo.
- Are you all right?
- I think so.
Where's Ico?
- I don't know.
- Where as he gone?
- What do you think?
- We've got to find him.
Gentlemen, the reports all agree on one point, the monster's power.
Not even tanks, it seems, can make a dent in him.
Very well, General.
Now, let me ask you What's next, if I may.
It's hopeless unless we start with the missiles.
Please, General. I've been thinking a lot about those missiles.
You know, they migth do more damage than Yongary.
And I'm very much afraid of one thing.
If those missiles go, they could destroy... one of te truly great landmarks of old Korea.
Gentlemen, as far as I am concerned, the time as come when we must discuss Korea's future and forget about Korea's past.
If he goes north, he'll hit the Pavilion of the Moon.
It seems to me that one ancient landmark is a lot less important than millions of lives.
Come in, Tower, this is Helicopter One.
We are flying above Yongary this minute.
All of his movements are slow at this time.
He as turned completely around and appears to be headed back the way he came.
All right, let's move.
What was it?
Why sould a monster drink oil?
I've got it.
Hum?
What's that?
Gentlemen, we've been observing Yongary.
He just drank a wole storage tank of oil.
He just drank What?
Mother, please.
Uncle Il-woo!
It's him, it's Ico.
- Hey!
- Ico.
- Ico, we thougt you were dead.
- Ico, where have you been, Ico?
Hey, Uncle Il-woo.
- Where were you?
- Watching Yongary.
- Really?
- Yes, and how about this?
- He eats oil and gasoline.
- You mean it?
Yes. I was standing near te main valve.
I shut it off so that he wouldn't be able to get any more to drink.
Boy, was he mad. He started screaming and pawing up te ground.
And guess What?
There was this one tank there.
His tail touced it and it blew up.
That's when he changed.
He started dancing around, itching and scratching.
Why do you think e did that, Uncle Il-woo?
- What kind of tank?
- I don't know.
Wait. There was a terrible smell and lots of ice.
What? A smell? And ice, too?
Uh-uh.
Show me where, Ico.
Il-woo, wait a minute.
You can't go anywere like that.
You're hurt.
I'm not just going to sit around.
- I'd better go with him.
- Soona, please...
Ico, no!
You have to stay here.
- Sorry, Il-woo needs my help.
- Oh, no, Ico. Ico...
Hello. I'm Professor Il-woo Nami.
I've got to get a closer look at Yongary.
Will you please let me in?
You got here a bit too late, sir.
They're going to hit Yongary any minute.
They'll be using guided missiles.
You'd better go.
They're going to it Yongary any minute.
They'll be using guided missiles.
You'd better go.
Missiles? Really?
They'll be no use.
Well, let's hope they are.
Anyway, I have my orders.
Then I guess we'd better go to headquarters.
I'm sorry. Father?
Soona, you know you souldn't...
Il-woo, What's wrong with you?
It's noting to worry about.
I believe you're planning on missiles as a way of attacking te monster.
- We have no choice.
- I wish you wouldn't.
Why?
It was Ico, here.
His reports on the monster gave me te first clue about it.
- Ico?
- Boy, you should have seen it.
Drank three big tanks of oil.
Gentlemen, there's a definite pattern here.
He consumes eat energy material.
He drinks gasoline and fuel oils.
Now, if eat nourises him, exploding missiles will do nothing more than add energy in larger amounts.
Tey will not destroy him.
All this on a child's story.
It is just a little ridiculous, you'll admit.
So, we've had our little joke.
Now we've got to move.
We've drawn plans.
We had better prepare all the missiles and set the launching in a short time.
- I say ten minutes.
- No, please.
Those missiles are really going to be dangerous.
Why not lure the monster away from te center of town?
You've got to get him in another area.
I mean, if you must go ahead and fire those missiles...
Sounds like a good idea.
Can it be done?
There's only one problem, tought.
How to move te monster away?
Use temptation.
Well, open the fuel tanks.
I mean, the ones at the Namsan depot.
You know,
I really can't take all this seriously.
Now, hold on, wait a minute. this as possibilities.
I say we open te depot.
If this scheme can save one human life, it's whort it.
He's right.
- I'll be in touch with you later.
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye.
- Good idea.
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi.
Well, Il-woo, do you need anything?
Well, yes, as a matter of fact.
A helicopter.
I can get you one.
Why do you need it?
Watch this.
When Yongary was at the refinery, he had a bad reaction from a chemical.
A chemical?
Uh-uh.
And if I'm not completely wrong, well, I think we can get him by using it.
Well, what's it made of?
A precipitate of ammonia.
- What?
- Ammonia?
Uh-uh.
All right.
Let's get it all open now.
Open all fuel vents.
I don't believe it's working.
- What's wrong, then? Not enough?
- Who knows?
- Get a helicopter.
- Yes, sir.
Hello, Six. Right.
Get me a helicopter.
Right. Here you are, sir.
Thank you. To Crew Three.
I see te monster won't move.
Climb two hundred feet up.
You're flying too close.
Acknowledge, please.
- I wonder where Ico is.
- I don't know.
Helicopter crew three reporting.
The monster seems to be reacting to some stimulas, which we cannot see.
He is starting to move, and his horn seems to be turning red.
Hey, it's working!
The monster is moving toward the refinery.
He is now at the refinery.
Time for the missiles.
Yes, sir.
Prepare the missiles.
Prepare the missiles.
- He seems to have slowed down.
- Yes.
This could be only temporary.
I think the solution, the ammonia, needs more work.
The missiles worked, I knew they would.
It happened, see? It's wonderful.
The monster is no longer a menace to our people.
- I knew they'd do the trick.
- Yes.
Let me see...
This migth work.
That's it. It's beautiful!
Hu?
I should have had more faith. this is the answer.
I just knew I was on the right track with that ammonia.
All we need now is a furter refinement of this precipitate.
That'll put him out of business and it's about time.
Il-woo, congratulations.
I'm sorry.
Il-woo, you know, I'm so proud of you.
You must be a genius.
What's wrong with you?
Hey. He's dancing!
Go, Yongary, go!
Hey, What's that?
- Come here.
- Hey, leave me alone.
What do you think you're doing?
Leave me alone, will you?
- Get your big mitts off me, will you?
- Come on.
- Get that kid out of here.
- Come on, let me go!
- Stop kicking, you little brat!
- Control Tower. Control Tower.
- It looks like he's still standing.
- What? Yongary's not dead?
Do you hear me?
- He's still alive, sir.
- That is correct. That is correct.
Area Eight, will you confirm please?
Thank you, Area Eight. Over and out.
- The missiles.
- Yes, sir, immediately.
Platoon.
Get moving!
- It's Yongary! He's alive!
- What?
Look, look! Yongary! Yongary!
Come on! Yongary!
Come on, all of you! Hurry!
Stop crawling! Come on! Yea!
Nothing seems to work.
We'd better head back.
- It's working, look!
- It's working!
Il-woo, you were right.
How wonderful.
He was.
- Oh, my!
- You see?
Stop, please.
No, don't do it anymore.
What is it?
Does he have to be killed?
Does he really?
Please, Uncle Il-woo.
I mean, you should have seen him last nigth. He was dancing.
Uncle Il-woo, we just couldn't have let him stay alive like he was, could we?
Ico, I know how you feel and I'm sure we all do.
Anyway, we have no choice about this.
Il-woo, in a way, you know,
I'm sorry, too.
I wonder if he really meant to hurt us.
Well, who's to say?
You know, we'd better be going.
Yes. We're finished here now. this is one time I don't mind going on record.
Hey, look.
Sir, do you have a statement for the press?
After all, it was your office that was responsible for defeating Yongary.
Well, no, I wouldn't say that.
I really think the first credit goes to Dr. Il-woo.
It was his analysis that gave us the key we needed.
There he is.
You'd better talk to him.
Sir, a moment please.
Do you have a statement for the press, sir?
We'd Iike to know how you did it.
How did you find te monster's weakness?
First of all, I'd Iike to thank the Minister very much.
For the rest of it, I'm gratified that science was able to be of help, but truthfully, that's only part.
Te very first clue was found by Ico, here.
I didn't do anything.
Ico, Ico, tell me how old you are?
About eigth.
Well, acting as scientific advisor to a whole nation is quite a job for an eight-year-old. without your work, we migth all ave been destroyed.
How do you feel about that?
Well, then, perhaps a word from your sister. Miss?
I'm no good at words.
Your brother's pretty special, isn't he, Miss?
Only special about getting himself in trouble.
Apart from that I'd say he's just an ordinary brat of a brother.
I think little brothers are supposed to act like brats, but, anyway, my sister's nice.
What would you like to be wen you grow up, Ico?
I want to be a great scientist, a biologist.
What would you like most in the world?
What wishes?
Let's see.
Well, one wish is about my sister and Uncle Il-woo.
I wish that the two of them would hurry up and get married.
Tey're just standing around doing nothing.
You miserable brat.
- Anything else, Ico?
- Yes, someting about Yongary.
I saw him play and dance.
I think all of you should realize it wasn't is fault.
You call im a monster just because of the things he did.
He was just looking for food and we had to kill him because he got in our way.
He migth have destroyed te entire Earth if we hadn't stopped him.
Of course I know.
I know that we had to kill him, honest.
But my other wish would be that he could be here now.
You're a fine young man.
We're all very proud of you.
Hey, let's get started, can we?
Well, now, then, about tat first wish of Ico's...
I must say we've been waiting for this.
Il-woo, What a wonderful idea.
- I think you should.
- Do you?
And What about Soona?
That sounds like a proposal.
You should take it.
Stop that.
I'd hate to disappoint Ico in all his wishes.
All right, I accept, in front of witnesses, too.
Hey, Soona, just think.
In a month or two, you may ave a little brat like me.
A month? Oh, you.
A lot of corrections: Kilo
Four down, six to go. Come on!
- It's a good sound.
- Sí. Very good.
Soon big boats will land in our harbor.
Then much happiness.
- Un buen ano.
- Sí.
A man can't even have a decent siesta around here anymore.
Hacker, wait.
Please, Hacker, no more trouble.
Let go, Chica. I warned him.
I'll teach that Bart Thompson who's boss around here.
Is that it?
No, the two at the end haven't gone yet.
They must've gotten wet.
Give 'em a couple minutes more, and we'll plant 'em again.
Right.
Everybody stay away from the water.
We may have a couple of live ones down there.
Lou, get another charge ready.
How are you coming on the road, Dumpy?
Pretty slow, boss.
The native workers haven't shown up yet.
Oh, no.
What do you suppose the reason is today?
Mike Hacker.
Of course Mike Hacker.
I wonder what his sick excuse is gonna be.
What the world are you doing?
- Me? Nothing, boss.
- No, no. Not again, Dumpy.
Haven't I got enough on my hands today?
Come on, Julio, let's go.
I didn't do no harm, Senor Bart.
Honest he didn't, boss.
Yeah, well, if I had enough time,
I'd give you both a spanking.
Your father asked us to keep you away from here.
- And you know that too, Dumpy.
- Yeah, I know.
Hacker's not my father, Senor Bart.
All right, but he is your guardian, right?
And he's the island manager, which means we have to get along with him.
I just want to learn.
I know you do, son.
Ban!
There's a little outboard coming into harbor!
That fool's liable to get blown to kingdom come!
Keep that flag waving!
For Pete sakes, whoever it is is waving back.
- It's Betty!
- Go back, Betty!
- Go back, Betty!
- Go back!
Turn around! You're in restricted water!
Turn back!
- Are you all right?
- I guess so.
- I'm sorry, Betty. We tried to warn you.
- Oh, by taking a shot at me?
That was no shot.
That was a delayed-action charge.
Oh. Well, I guess that makes all the difference.
What in the world are you doing now?
I'm going down to Davy Jones's locker for my mother's portable icebox, in which I had stashed all sorts of goodies for you guys to eat, and which I intend to eat whether you're hungry or not.
Betty, wait! The water's not safe!
- Ain't love wonderful?
- What's happening?
They just dove in for a swim.
That's dangerous. There's still debris churning around down there.
Yeah.
Ain't love strange?
Okay. Just take it easy, Betty.
All right. Everybody back to work.
Chuck, take another diver and check out that channel bottom.
There's something strange down there.
The water was ice-cold.
We might have blown the lid off a subterranean river.
- Check it out, will you?
- Roger. Come on.
When I get out at the end here, Julio, you head on for home.
Don't want you to get into any trouble, now, do we?
No.
Julio!
Come here!
And you, get that foolish machine out of here.
All right, all right.
Next time maybe you'll stay in the cantina and do your chores like I tell you, huh?
Now, you wait here.
Come on, now.
Come on, you've got to drink this.
Bart, it's out there. I saw it. I swear!
A green monster with a head the size of this room.
What do I have to do to make you believe me?
Excuse me for intruding on this tender little scene.
Now we got a monster in here too.
You'd better start learning how to knock real quick, Hacker.
All the doors on this island are open to me, boss man.
I come here to complain about the noise you're making.
The citizenry doesn't like it.
And now I find your carelessness has almost cost us the lovely Miss Piper.
- It was my fault, Mr. Hacker.
- Nonsense.
You were supposed to put up warning signs before you started blasting.
They were up!
And this might not have happened
- if we'd had the extra men you promised.
- Men? What men?
The islanders, Hacker. Remember?
No, I don't remember.
Okay. For two weeks,
I've given you the benefit of the doubt while I've fallen behind schedule.
- From now on, we bypass you.
- That wouldn't be too wise.
The governor of the island gave us his cooperation and, as his representative, you're supposed to do the same.
Yours is cooperation, all right, but at a price, isn't it?
I look out for my people.
You bet you do.
Ban!
- Bart!
- What's wrong?
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,
I wouldn't believe it.
- What?
- The monster?
- Two of them, Betty.
- Two what? What are you babbling about?
Two huge, ugly dinosaurs perfectly preserved at the bottom of the channel.
Are they dead?
Frozen solid.
- Million-year-old dinosaurs?
- The same, Bart.
I don't know what else they could be.
But I'll tell you one thing.
- One look and you'll never forget 'em.
- You see?
This ought to be worth a fortune.
We must've blasted through the rock that entombed them.
Some compressed gas caused the freezing,
I guess.
As island manager,
I demand you bring those things up!
Tread lightly. You don't demand anything around here today.
- Is the governor still in Washington?
- So far as I know, he is.
And that leaves me in complete charge of this island.
We'll send him a wire and have him contact the Smithsonian.
He'll send paleontologists down here right away, and we'll bring the critters up and put them on the beach.
- You think the big crane will handle 'em?
- I think so.
Get her set up, and I'll be with you in a minute.
Can I trust you to send this?
You have my word. And a witness.
All right, here.
- What are you grinning about?
- Was I grinning, boss man?
Maybe it's just that this time, after all your whining, you've caused your own delay.
We can't build a harbor around two dinosaurs, Hacker.
So we take a couple hours and move 'em, and we get right back to work with no more delays.
Bravo.
You were awfully hard on him, weren't you, Bart?
I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw a- a dinosaur.
Let's go monster fishing.
Okay, Lou, we're all hooked up.
Bring her in nice and easy.
Are they really dinosaurs, Senorita Betty?
- Yes, Julio, they are.
- Boy, this is terrific!
Keep her coming, Lou.
Well? What do you think, Bart?
Thank goodness he's not alive.
You can say that again.
- Let's get our hooks in the next one.
- Roger.
Is that what you saw?
You scared me.
With him around? Thanks a lot.
I just can't get over it.
- Is he alive, Senor Bart?
- No, he's not alive.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
Then why are his eyes open?
Well, he just-
He just slept with them open, that's all.
Boy, he's magnifico. That's for certain.
Wait till you see the next one.
They tell me he's even bigger.
He must weigh about 50 tons.
He doesn't look as mean as the other one.
He's not mean. He's herbivorous.
Where did you learn a word like that?
Oh, I'm well educated in those things.
I sent away a cereal box tops and got models just like them, only smaller.
Can I go up and see them closer?
- Okay, Professor.
- Oh, thanks, Senor Bart.
Senor Bart, he's very cold.
Yeah, he's what you might call kind of quick-frozen.
How long has he been that way?
Million years or so, I guess.
Boy, oh, boy!
I'd better investigate further!
Hey, look. Why don't you go change while I get things wrapped up here, and then we'll whisk away to a romantic spot for dinner.
The only restaurant on the island.
But you've got to admit it's the best cuisine in a thousand-mile radius.
- Okay, I'll be ready in a few minutes.
- Okay.
Hey, Bart.
You think we ought to leave a guard for our little playmates tonight?
Yeah, I guess so. I don't see how anyone's gonna walk off with them though.
Give him half a chance, and Hacker would try.
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.
- Senor Bart!
- What's the matter?
He's alive! Look!
Oh, no. No, no. He's just thawing out.
- Then will he be alive?
- Nope.
Hey, don't you think you'd better head on home?
No. Senor Hacker told me to wait in the car. I guess I'd better.
Okay.
O'Leary? Off and on, me bucko!
T.J. O'Leary at your service, boss.
O'Leary, I got a job for you tonight- babysitting.
With whose children?
Those dinosaurs over there.
Oh, saints preserve us.
Them are really there?
Oh, thank the good Lord.
I've been seeing them all afternoon and was afraid to tell anyone for fear it was the DTs!
Sure, if they be needin' diapering, you can find some tarpaulins behind the shed.
Oh, sure, boss! Sure!
And they ain't the first dinosaur
I've ever seen, you know.
Why, your timing's perfect.
Are you wrinkle-free and ready to go?
Yeah. If we hurry, we'll make it there before the rain does.
It sure gets dark fast down here.
Everything happens fast in the tropics.
Who is it?
It's me, Jasper.
Come in. It's about time you got here.
It was stormy and wet out tonight,
Mr. Hacker.
Fine, fine.
I don't need your weather report.
Sit down and shut up. I'll do the talking.
We're going to be rich, boys.
You hear that, Chica?
I heard, Hacker.
You don't sound too happy about it.
Should I be?
Why, sure.
You're my little tamale, aren't you?
- Leave me alone, Hacker.
- "Leave me alone, Hacker."
I don't hear you telling the turistas
“Leave me alone."
- Let me go. You are hurting me.
- I am going to be rich, Chica.
Dress you in pretty things, soft to the touch.
- I don't want your money.
- But I want you.
And I know certain things about you that certain authorities would like to find out.
- Lies!
- They'll lock you up in jail until your pretty face is old and wrinkled.
All you know is lies!
Maybe so.
But who will be believed, huh?
You or the island manager?
So you see, Chica... you are mine.
Why not enjoy it?
And now leave us alone, my little tamale.
We have some business to discuss.
I have found a caveman.
Perfectly intact.
Probably a million years old.
We are going to take him to the mainland and sell him for a fortune.
You mean he's dead?
Of course he's dead. He's prehistoric.
That's what makes him so valuable.
What's my cut?
Yeah, and mine?
A thousand dollars apiece for helping me get him to the boat as soon as the storm lets up.
- It's a deal.
- Yeah, right. It's a deal.
Telegram.
Help yourself to some food, boys.
Hey, how are you farin', my fine, strapping babes?
A- teethin', are ya? Well.
You're a very sweet and quiet babe not to be shriekin' about it.
And you too. Mustn't play favorites.
Well, I'm going in where it's warm, boys.
You be good now and sleep tight.
Hey, Julio. What you got there?
Oh, these are my monsters
I got from my cereal box tops.
I thought I'd bring them over to show you.
Say, those are really something.
Hey, Chuck, look.
This one's the brontosaurus.
He's a vegetarian.
He wouldn't hurt you unless you got in his way and he stepped on you.
But this one's the mean one, the tyrannosaurus.
He's got a bigger brain and a bigger appetite.
He eats meat, and he likes to eat brontosaurus, even better than people.
Well, I'll be darned. You really know a lot about these things, don't you?
Oh, yes, Senor Bart. I play with them all the time. They are my friends.
Julio!
What the devil are you doing out here?
You're going to learn when I tell you to stay in the back room and finish your chores quietly, that is exactly what I mean!
- Take it easy, Hacker!
- You keep your nose out of this.
I'm sorry, Sefior Hacker!
I won't do it again!
You're going to learn a lesson, boy.
Oh, no, senor, please! That's my friend!
Hacker, that's enough.
Now come here, boy.
I hate you! I'm gonna run away and never come back!
All right, go ahead! See if I care!
Julio, wait!
If anything happens to that boy,
I swear I'll take it out of your hide.
Julio?
- You couldn't find him.
- No, I couldn't.
Don't come another step closer, boss man, or I'll...
You'll what?
I'll slash you to ribbons.
Somebody bandage him up.
A little fortification and then we'll go out and see what that last bit 0' lightnin' has done to our babes.
Earthquakes too! Ha!
This place is ridiculous.
Did you ever see such a sight in your life? I-
I swear, I'll never take another drink as long as I live!
Good girl.
I wonder how long it'll be before the lights come on again.
The last time something happened to our generator, it was two days before they fixed it.
They didn't have any power on this whole island for two days?
Yes, except for some of the houses on the hills.
They have their own generator.
Storm's about over. Round up some of the boys. We'll go have a look.
Right.
No! No!
Go away!
No!
Let me go! Oh, no! Let me out!
Help! Help! Oh, let me out!
Let me out! Let me out!
Help! They've 9011-
Let me down! Oh, you wild beast!
Let me down! Help!
- What was that?
- It wasn't thunder, that's for sure.
- It sounded like dynamite. Come on. Chuck!
- Roger.
Let's go!
Hurry up!
They'll be too close to our prize package.
No dinosaurs, no shack.
And worst of all, no O'Leary.
Hey, boss!
O'Leary's hat.
You think he's dead?
Nobody could live through that kind of an explosion, Dumpy.
Poor guy.
What happened to the dinosaurs?
Bart! Come here!
It looks like the big one just up and walked away.
Walked away?
How could he walk away if he's dead?
- It isn't possible.
- What are we going to do?
Uh-oh.
Look.
What are you doing, Hacker?
I was looking to see- to see if Julio was around here.
Under the leaves?
You can do better than that.
A fat lot you care what happens to that boy.
Will you get your hands off me?
I've had a change of heart.
Okay, I was wrong this time.
You had nothing to do with this.
You don't know what that sound was, do you?
A bird?
That's a dinosaur, Hacker.
A big, hungry, flesh-eating dinosaur.
You mean...
We gotta get back to town and start making phone calls for help.
- The phones are out, Bart.
- The overseas phone.
- Everything's out.
- How do we get word out, Hacker?
Mail boat will be in tomorrow morning.
By tomorrow, we could all be dead.
Doesn't anyone here have a shortwave radio?
Some of the fishing boats have some, but they won't be back till the end of the week.
When can we get an answer to that wire?
I... I didn't get around to sending it.
Well, that's just great.
Bart, I wish my dad wasn't away.
He's got some sort of radio rig.
- A shortwave radio?
- Yes, he's a ham operator.
But he's always taking it apart.
I don't know if it's working.
At least it's something to go on.
I think I can get it to work.
Meantime, we've got to figure out some way of defending ourselves.
How many weapons are there on the island?
Some small-game guns, a couple of pistols.
But what good would they be against those monsters?
And there's a relic cannon up at the old fortress.
- That might not be a bad idea, Bart.
- A relic cannon?
No, the fortress.
I was up there last Sunday.
It's just some old ruins, but the walls are thick and fairly high.
And there's what's left of a moat around the place.
We could widen it and burn oil as a barrier.
That sounds like our best idea.
Get the bulldozers and whatever else you need to get set up at the fortress.
- Right.
- Tell everybody on the way up there.
Hey, boss, maybe if I rang the fire gong, we could get them all out in a hurry.
No, no. All we need is a couple hundred frightened people running through town.
That monster will know where his next meal's coming from.
How about us with the heavy equipment?
I don't think he'll bother you if you travel in a tight convoy.
- Drive with your lights out.
- Roger.
Let's go, guys. Come on.
We've got work to do.
You girls go on with Chuck.
Dumpy and I will spread the word in town, and we'll get to your house and see if that radio's working.
- Bart, my mother's home all alone.
- Don't worry. We'll bring her back.
How about you, Hacker?
Are we gonna get any help from you?
I've got to go find my boy.
I feel terrible. He means so much to me.
I will risk the danger. I'll take my men, and we'll go search the island.
I understand. We'll keep a lookout too.
You see, Bart? Nobody's all bad.
Senor Bart, when I was a little girl in another country, there was a revolution.
My father taught me how to make bombs out of bottles and gasoline.
- We'll use some, no?
- We'll use some, yes.
- Run and tell Chuck that.
- Okay.
Hey, boss. There's a couple of walkie-talkies in the tool shed.
Should I get 'em?
We'll keep in touch with Chuck.
- That's a good idea, Dumpy.
- Okay.
Bart, I'm going with you.
No, you're not.
It's a lot safer for you at the fortress.
We may never get there.
If something happens,
I want to be with you.
Is that you, Betty?
How was the boy dressed, Mr. Hacker?
I didn't notice.
Don't be so style-conscious, Jasper.
We're looking for the caveman, not that brat.
I knew you hadn't changed.
Remember, you're the friendly vegetarian, like it says on the cereal box.
Hey, you are friendly.
We are going to be friends, you and me.
That's the bad tyrannosaurus!
You'd better run and find a swamp to hide in, where he won't follow you.
'Cause if he catches us, he'll eat both of us up.
And he'll like you better than me
'cause you're bigger.
And I don't want him to eat you, so please run!
I know you don't know which way to run, and I wish I could tell you.
But you see, I'm just a boy and I'm lost
'cause I don't go out at night by myself, and I don't know where the swamps are.
You see? You've got to go!
Please run! I can't push you!
That a boy!
Run, run! And keep running!
Good-bye, my friend.
I hope I will see you again soon.
Take care of yourself.
Tom, tell everyone to go quickly and quietly.
Once they get to the fortress, they should just relax.
- Dumpy, let's go!
- Okay, boss!
Hey, boss, it's a dud, ain't it?
No, you have to light that cloth tail,
Dumpy.
But a spark could do it.
- Put them in here.
- Yeah, boss.
Put them on something soft so they don't get jostled.
- And no smoking.
- You ain't kiddin'.
XLN2W calling LNR6J.
XLN2W calling LNR6J.
Do you read me? Over.
XLN2W calling LNR6J.
XLN2W calling LNR6J.
Come in, please.
XLNZW calling-
I wish we could go faster.
These roads don't help any.
We are almost there, Chuck.
Mousey!
- Did you find him?
- Nope.
The whole back part is filled with water,
Mr. Hacker.
That's why they closed this place.
They haven't used it in years.
Let's get out of here.
This place gives me the creeps.
Jasper seems to be enjoying it.
Huh, Jasper?
Sure, boss. It's very interesting.
I mean, where else are you going to find a caveman except in a cave?
“In a cave." “In a cave.“
Jasper, your intelligence never ceases to amaze me.
I didn't know you were an anthropologist.
Not a very good one, boss.
I mean, I ain't been to church in years.
Ah, well, if he's not in a cave, maybe he's in a house.
Come on. We'll start looking in houses.
Is there anyone else living out this way we could warn?
No. Ours is the next place, and it's the last one.
Betty?
Senorita Betty?
Holy smoke! A real caveman!
You want this?
Boy, you sure are hungry.
I guess maybe you are a houseguest of
Betty's scientist father, the doctor, huh?
More? Funny they didn't show you where the food was.
Come on, I'll show you. See?
We're in luck! We've got some pie. See?
You take those things over to the table while I make us something warm to drink.
I don't think Betty would mind.
You really don't know much about these things, do you?
I'll be your friend. I'll show you.
Come on, caveman, come on.
Come on.
Right here.
No. Eat with your fork.
Like this.
Eat right. Eat like this.
With your fork.
That must be Betty. Come on. Surprise her.
Show her how I taught you how to eat with a fork.
Surprise!
There he is. Get the kid out of the way, and get him with as few blows as is possible.
Run, caveman! Run! They're bad men!
No! No, caveman! It's not right to kill!
You two are worthless. Stand back.
Let a man at him. You got the rope?
Yeah, boss. Right here.
All right. I'll pin him down, you bind his hands and feet.
What are you standing there for?
Get out and get him, or I pity both of you!
Go on!
Come on. They can't be far ahead.
Come on. If we have to run all night, we're going to catch them.
Come on. Top speed.
Mother?
There's nobody here, that's for sure.
Boy, this place is a mess.
Mother!
Yeah, and whoever busted this up sure did a thorough job.
Boy, they sure did.
Mother!
- Better calm her down.
- You think...
I don't know.
She's not here, Bart.
Something's happened. I know it.
Come on, calm down. Keep your chin up.
Look, her car's gone.
She could be in town, or she might be at the fortress already with Chuck.
- Do you think she might be?
- There's a good chance.
Besides, going to pieces isn't going to help a bit.
Somebody had a sloppy feast in here, Bart.
And the teakettle's still boiling.
Whoever was here didn't leave long ago.
Dumpy, go out to the jeep and see if you can contact Chuck on the walkie-talkie.
He should be at the fortress by now.
Gotcha, boss.
- What do we do now?
- We'll head for the fortress.
See if you've got kerosene lanterns.
We could use them.
Okay, I'll get them.
Hey, boss!
Yeah?
Yeah, Chuck, sure. Just a minute.
Here he comes now.
Betty's mother is safe.
Oh, good. Tell Betty and give her a hand, will you, Dumpy?
- I sure will.
- Yeah, Chuck?
Yeah, Bart. So far, so good.
Not a sign of the monsters. And we're making pretty good progress with the moat.
If we could be sure of a couple more hours, I'd say we'd have it secured.
- How about the islanders?
- We got most of them in from the village.
There are more coming from the hills all the time.
They're frightened.
I can't say that I blame them.
When I stop to think of it,
I get pretty scared myself.
I know what you mean.
- How about Julio?
- Not a sign of him.
We'll keep our eyes peeled for him on the way back.
I'd comb the jungle if I thought there was a chance of finding him alive.
Don't be a fool, Bart. You'll have a hard enough time just getting back here.
I know.
- She said she saw an ape man?
- That's what she said, Betty.
She probably was so frightened she really didn't know what she saw.
At least she's all right. You want to take these out and put them in the jeep?
I'll get a first-aid kit in case we need it.
And don't be too long, because the sooner we get back to those fortress walls, the better I'll feel.
Okay.
Hey, boss?
Boss? Boss, where are you?
Over here, Dumpy.
Look what I found. Hacker's car.
Uh-oh. I wonder what he's got to do with that mess inside?
And the broken radio.
Check under the seats.
I don't know what to look for, but I wouldn't put anything past that man.
Bart, it's Julio!
Dumpy, we've got to get that boy!
Hurry, Bart, hurry! Julio, we're coming!
We may need those. Come on!
Boy, you sure are one terrific caveman, you know that?
I never had so much fun in my life!
I didn't know you could ride a dinosaur.
Julio! Julio!
- What are we gonna do?
- Julio, it's me, Betty!
Senorita Betty, run! Go away!
Look out behind you!
He saved her life, but there's no telling what he might do next. Come on!
This way.
I'm lost, boss. Any idea where we are?
The house is back that way.
We just got to keep going. Through here.
Whoa! Please stop!
We'll be right back where we started, and the tyrannosaurus will eat us up!
You saved my life.
I really don't know how to thank you.
I'm very grateful.
You want me to cook it? Your dinner.
I think you ought to know something before I start.
I'm not a very good cook.
You don't care, huh?
Okay. One rabbit, medium-rare.
Hope that's how you like it.
I hope you don't have anything else on your mind.
Wristwatch.
Now, now. Nice caveman. Just sit there, and I'll go fix things in the kitchen.
Now, let's see.
What does a nice caveman do after a hard day's work in the jungle?
No, no, don't tell me. Let me think of something tame on my own.
Like sitting down.
And we'll keep all other thoughts out of our romantic little Neanderthal minds.
Okay?
Let's see.
Maybe if I sing you a song, you'll fall asleep, and then I can run away from you, hmm?
Lullaby and good night
Go to sleep, little caveman
Leave my friend alone, you bad old tyrannosaurus!
Talk about ringside seats.
Hit him again with your tail!
Come on! Hit him!
Oh, no! Boss, look over there.
Boss, I don't see the kid anymore.
He's on the other side. The way they're spinning around, he could get crushed.
Come on, we got to get him.
Not that way. That's quicksand!
No! No!
Julio!
The caveman again.
Follow him, we'll get to Betty too.
- There he is, men.
- Yeah.
Yeah, but look at that monster.
We're going in to get that caveman.
I don't want the money, boss.
- It's too late for that now, Jasper.
- I'm sorry, boss. I quit.
Jasper, come back here!
We've got to get him away from that cave.
Now!
Come on, Mr. Hacker, have a heart.
I'm telling you, Mousey, it'll be perfectly safe.
Get in through that opening, climb down on the rope, take him prisoner, and bring him out when the coast is clear.
I'm scared of the monster and the bomb too, Mr. Hacker.
One. I'm tired of being disobeyed, Mousey.
I'm ashamed of myself. I really am.
Two. I mean business this time.
You know I'd do anything for you.
You know that, Mr. Hacker.
But this... this will be suicide.
- Three.
- Okay, okay. I'll go.
Mousey, you yellow coward! I'll kill you!
I'll do it myself.
That mine shaft's nothing but a bunch of rotted timbers.
It can't hold much longer the way he's going at it.
And these things don't bother him a bit.
Maybe if I could pop one right in his mouth, he'd decide to beat it out of here.
Boss, that's a good trick if you can do it.
When I tell you, you throw one of those bombs as close to his eyes as you can.
That'll attract his attention.
It'll let me get within a couple of feet, where I can't miss.
Okay.
Mr. Hacker, thank goodness you're here.
Don't anybody move.
Blasted rope. Now we have to wait for the monster to leave before we can get out.
Unless we give him some distraction while the others leave.
- You must be crazy!
- Is that what you think?
Do you know how much money people all over the world will pay to look at that monkey man?
Oh, what is this? Bravery, huh?
Little man, I could puncture holes in you with this play toy of mine.
He doesn't know what a gun is.
He's just a nice, kind-
Leave him alone!
Don't worry, boy. I won't hurt him.
He's going to be my fortune.
And you- you are going to be my way out of here.
No, Hacker, no!
I'm getting out of here!
We got rid of him for a while.
- Yeah. Boy, is he mad!
- Let's get in there.
Betty, Julio, are you all right?
- Oh, Bart.
- Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's go!
Caveman! Caveman!
Go on, go on!
- Get him out of here.
- Caveman! Caveman!
- Come on, caveman!
- Come on!
Come on!
Couple more minutes, and that dinosaur is gonna remember he's hungry again.
Did Hacker get out?
Yeah.
Caveman! Where is the caveman!
Come on!
Look!
Look, he's heading for the quicksand!
Now's our chance. Head back to the jeep.
I'm gonna take another look around here just in case.
Be careful.
I will. Now hurry.
Caveman! Caveman! Caveman!
We got a ditch all around the fortress except on the side overlooking the ocean.
We just open those drums, put a torch to the oil, and we got a moat of flames.
Good. Is everyone in the fortress?
Yeah, everybody except for the guys in the equipment.
And there's a little path over there they can go up in case they get caught outside when the fire starts.
You've done a good job, Chuck.
We got enough oil?
That's the problem. The moat had to be bigger than I anticipated.
How many minutes of flame can you give me?
Five, maybe, if we're lucky.
- No sign of the boat yet?
- No.
Pedro?
Quieres comer?
I'm not hungry.
You should eat something, Julio.
A growing boy needs-
I don't want to grow anymore.
The mail boat will soon be here.
You're probably going to get that airplane from the cereal box.
I don't care about any airplane.
Well, remember, there's a good bowl of soup if you want it.
What are you seeing out there, Dumpy?
Nothing. And right now, that looks mighty good to me.
Are you taking care of the alarm?
Hey!
Huh? Monster!
Take it easy. Relax.
The monster's not here yet.
But you keep your eyes open, and you'll be a fine alarm man.
Sí', senor. Sorry.
Sorry, senor.
I hope the rest of our setup is better than that.
Don't worry about him.
If that monster comes within a mile of this place, that bell will be ringing.
He's here! Sound the alarm!
Dinosaurus!
Monster!
We got to hold it off as long as possible.
- It's holding him.
- Yeah, but for how long?
- You're in charge. I got an idea.
- Hey, wait a minute!
Bart! Bart!
- Bart, let me come with you.
- I can't.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna knock that monster off the cliff.
I love you.
I can't hear you.
Be careful. I love you.
Chica.
Hey, Chuck, do you think we can drive the bulldozer through the fire?
Not a chance, Dumpy. Why?
To help Bart. Look what he's doing.
Come on, Senor Bart! Get him!
Watch out, Senor Bart!
Dumpy, if you've ever prayed, do it now.
- Oh, Senor Bart.
- Bart, are you all right?
- Bart, that was terrific.
- Oh, thank heavens.
- Wasn't he great?
- Senor Bart, why did the caveman have to die?
Well, Julio... there's a time for everything.
The caveman slept all those years, and then one day he awoke like Rip Van Winkle... and found the world so changed that he didn't belong in it anymore.
How would you like it if you woke in the 21st century?
No, house, no friends, even the town gone.
Just a strange world.
I would like it.
You know, I bet you would at that.
I'll bet one day you will wake in the 21st century.
You really mean it?
Yeah.
Oh, boy!
There you are, my dear.
There's your tropical island.
Look at all those people up there waving at us.
Do you suppose they greet all the ships like this?
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
On a peaceful, quiet island like this,
I don't suppose they have anything better to do.
{361}{548}LATITUDE ZERO
{2499}{2565}Longitude, one hundred eighty degrees.
{2570}{2594}Latitude...
{2601}{2620}...ZERO!
{2745}{2817}The spring of 1969.
{2826}{2929}The largest oceanographic ship in the world,|the Japanese research vessel "Fuji"...
{2931}{3007}...has sailed eastward|from the Gilbert Islands to...
{3010}{3119}...an area in the equatorial South Pacific|to investigate and analyze what is known...
{3125}{3217}...as the Cromwell Current,|a subsurface stream flowing east from...
{3219}{3280}...New Guinea to the coast of Ecuador.
{3397}{3442}Why do they study it?
{3446}{3577}Because possibly it can be used|by submarines to increase speed...
{3579}{3666}...just as the jet stream is|used by high-flying aircraft.
{4387}{4414}Shall we go?
{4421}{4438}Yeah.
{4465}{4601}Dr. Ken Tashiro, physicist and|oceanographer is in command.
{4630}{4691}Aiding him is Dr. Jules Masson.
{4694}{4788}A French geologist and veteran|of many bathysphere expeditions.
{4791}{4874}Perry Lawton from Trans Globe News...
{4899}{4992}His story and photographs are to be|"pooled", that is made available to...
{4995}{5050}...all the various news services.
{5127}{5140}Oh!
{5159}{5174}Hey.
{5247}{5338}I wasn't going to light up in here.|l just carry it to ease my mind.
{5454}{5513}This is control. How do you read us?
{5535}{5617}Loud and clear.|Just passing twenty fathoms.
{5619}{5661}How's the temperature?
{5701}{5774}Exterior watertemp|two-zero degrees centigrade.
{5796}{5850}Bathysphere temp two-six.
{5852}{5956}We'll be pulling you up in twelve hours.|Have a good trip. Out.
{6335}{6406}Red lights increase vision|as we get deeper.
{6522}{6546}Check this!
{6595}{6619}The fish...
{6702}{6753}How come they're all going one way?
{6870}{6909}What'd you make of it?
{6963}{7023}Do they know something that we don't?
{7027}{7068}Turn on the searchlights.
{7527}{7588}Exterior water temp is one-five...
{7618}{7676}That's normal for this depth.
{8389}{8443}Hey! What's that coming at us?
{14055}{14088}Where are we?
{14101}{14160}-Looks like we were saved.|-Right.
{14214}{14287}Hey, we don't have any scars either.
{14293}{14351}Look, they are all healed.
{14575}{14656}Glad to see you two are feeling better.|l'm Dr. Anne Barton.
{14662}{14696}Dr. Tashiro...
{14698}{14740}l'm Perry Lawton.
{14743}{14795}And your companion...what's his name?
{14797}{14867}Jules...Dr. Jules Masson.
{14902}{14921}He's okay?
{14928}{15000}We're taking care of him.|He's in a separate cabin.
{15016}{15108}When you feel up to getting dressed,|the Control Room's straight ahead.
{15142}{15227}Oh, I don't know whose camera it is,|but I put it there.
{15350}{15393}Doctor of medicine?
{15544}{15575}How do you feel?
{16764}{16812}Oh, nice to see you up and about.
{16814}{16861}You must be Dr. Tashiro...
{16863}{16875}Yes.
{16879}{16938}l'm Captain Craig McKenzie.|Nice to meet you.
{16941}{16991}This is my assistant, Kobo.
{17042}{17066}Mr. Lawton...
{17069}{17092}Trans Globe...
{17095}{17152}Ah yes, all the news from pole to pole.
{17155}{17187}We do try.
{17198}{17235}How is Dr. Masson, sir?
{17237}{17335}Dr. Barton reported he is suffering|from shock and a cranial injury.
{17337}{17363}Is it bad?
{17366}{17432}Everything is being done to effect|his recovery as soon as possible.
{17434}{17522}This Dr. Barton looks so young!|She doesn't look much like a doctor.
{17527}{17616}Mr. Lawton, what's a doctor|supposed to look like?
{17620}{17645}Well...
{17655}{17702}Now, there...what is that?
{17768}{17840}That is the volcano that tore|you loose from your mooring.
{17869}{17939}Now you're seeing it from a viewing|scanner we have on the surface.
{17941}{17973}How close is it?
{18004}{18047}About ten miles away.
{18057}{18131}Our volcanologists have been|predicting this eruption for a month.
{18133}{18185}That's why we are here to observe it.
{18188}{18252}And that's why we happened|to observe your difficulty.
{18279}{18376}Had you been dropped two miles farther|south, you'd have been incinerated.
{18397}{18442}That's a pleasant thought.
{18453}{18482}Where are we?
{18486}{18522}What is this anyway?
{18525}{18576}This is the Alpha, a submersible.
{18583}{18632}An American nuclear sub?
{18683}{18714}Or Japanese?
{18721}{18784}No. Mr. Lawton, neither are we|American, Russian, British...
{18787}{18830}...nor any other nationality.
{18833}{18868}We are neutral.
{18918}{18953}You're neutral?
{18959}{19053}Look, a submarine like this has got to|come from somewhere. Now where?
{19081}{19127}-That's irrelevant.|-It can't be.
{19129}{19187}I'm a reporter. I do know|a story when I see one.
{19189}{19279}I imagine you do, but you can't|cable your editors from here.
{19341}{19360}Perry!
{19517}{19628}The Alpha, launched June 21 , 1805...
{19634}{19741}Stornaway Harbor, Hebrides...|that's in Scotland, isn't it?
{19863}{19971}That would make this submarine|a hundred sixty-four years old!
{19973}{20005}Can you believe that?
{20006}{20026}No way.
{20041}{20080}Neither do I.
{20197}{20255}Excuse me, Captain McKenzie.
{20257}{20279}Yes?
{20284}{20378}This business about your submarine|being launched in 1805...
{20398}{20441}That's a put-on, isn't it?
{20445}{20461}What?
{20474}{20507}I mean...a joke.
{20509}{20527}No.
{20629}{20694}Captain, he's not responding.
{20698}{20778}I am afraid, we can't treat him|successfully aboard the Alpha.
{20780}{20859}You know the importance of|this observation, don't you?
{20872}{20939}-How urgent is this problem?|-Very urgent.
{20941}{20986}The shock factor is manageable, but...
{20989}{21077}...he suffered some internal injuries|requiring care we're not equipped to give.
{21082}{21141}Then you recommend|we call off this mission?
{21143}{21184}If he's to live.
{21249}{21323}What are you gonna do now, Captain?|Toss a coin?
{21489}{21562}-Kobo, set course to El-zee.|-Yes, Captain.
{21743}{21826}Hello, El-zee, this is the Alpha.
{21829}{21878}Go ahead, Captain McKenzie.
{21881}{21928}We are aborting the mission.
{21954}{22040}Alert Rehabilitation Clinic to pick up|injured man as soon as we dock.
{22065}{22093}That is all.
{22116}{22137}Kobo...
{22170}{22202}Flank speed.
{22205}{22233}Yes, Captain.
{22405}{22444}How fast are we going?
{22446}{22498}A shade under eighty knots.
{22503}{22556}Now if you'll excuse me...
{22678}{22726}Dock at Latitude Zero?
{22729}{22820}That's where the Equator and|lnternational Date Line cross.
{22823}{22882}But there's no land there.
{23093}{23109}Malic!
{23130}{23148}Malic!
{23163}{23189}Come quickly!
{23219}{23277}Have our agents finally|kidnapped Dr. Okada?
{23282}{23338}No word from them, but look!
{23350}{23405}McKenzie is leaving the volcano.
{24096}{24153}Kroiga, this is Malic.
{24180}{24245}I am here, my lord Malic.
{24252}{24334}The Alpha is northeast of you,|on course for Latitude Zero.
{24354}{24438}It would please me if you|intercepted and destroyed it.
{24450}{24512}Your wish is my command, my lord.
{24577}{24647}We're near enough to|get McKenzie this time.
{24690}{24757}You should reach the Alpha|within the quarter hour.
{24774}{24821}Do your best, little one.
{24828}{24880}McKenzie will be destroyed.
{24882}{24929}This I promise, my lord.
{24931}{25002}And your reward shall|be waiting, little one.
{25169}{25217}Your jealousy is showing.
{25238}{25294}I can't help it. I just hate that woman.
{25297}{25354}Don't be silly. She's useful to us.
{25414}{25465}You're the only woman I keep with me.
{25468}{25548}Please get rid of her and let|Ching take over the Black Shark.
{25550}{25662}I will, eventually...|after she destroys the Alpha and McKenzie.
{25722}{25821}Later, Lucretia, when we have|something to really celebrate.
{26518}{26554}The Black Shark.
{26566}{26601}Is it going to attack?
{26602}{26647}It always has. Turn off the lights.
{26649}{26662}Yes.
{26719}{26766}Do you have anything to fight it with?
{26769}{26826}We have nothing as|powerful as what it has.
{26842}{26891}It's faster than us as well.
{26912}{26973}It's a matter of how to escape.
{27821}{27866}Go up twenty meters.
{28196}{28246}Maybe that avalanche caught them.
{28844}{28904}Prepare search missiles!
{29338}{29390}Search missiles ready!
{29771}{29814}Those aren't torpedoes!
{29816}{29871}No, they are search missiles.
{29883}{29925}They follow our heat path.
{29928}{29999}Kobo, activate the icing equipment.
{30007}{30026}Yes, Captain.
{30282}{30315}It doesn't work, Captain.
{30799}{30842}Do something! Will you!
{31364}{31426}McKenzie has increased|the mobility of the Alpha.
{31427}{31497}He's forever changing|something on that damned boat!
{31499}{31572}Your ''little one'' is no match for him.
{31575}{31650}Don't underestimate her|just because you dislike her.
{31652}{31691}She was stupid!
{31693}{31778}If those missiles had backfired,|she could have cost us the Black Shark.
{32020}{32112}Trying to get close up to use|their laser cannon, I would guess.
{32643}{32668}Another sub!
{32670}{32731}No. That's a ghost image of us.
{32934}{32963}Marvelous!
{32975}{33011}How ingenious!
{33100}{33156}It must be a projection|device of some kind.
{33159}{33239}Of course! But which is the real Alpha|and which is the image?
{33267}{33364}How bloody inventive that McKenzie is!
{33799}{33838}I have done it!
{33846}{33890}I have finally done it!
{33941}{33976}Did she do it?
{34003}{34076}That's what McKenzie|would like us to believe.
{34123}{34138}See?
{34195}{34241}He has made a fool of her.
{34256}{34322}She shouldn't have fired|those missiles so soon!
{34528}{34567}How did you do that?
{34568}{34662}Well, not exactly with mirrors,|Dr. Tashiro.
{34774}{34802}Top speed!
{34820}{34842}Ram it!
{35668}{35704}What's that glow?
{35707}{35775}That's the light of our artificial sun.
{35795}{35839}Sun? Under the sea?
{35855}{35919}Kobo, turn on the equalizers.
{35934}{35956}Yes, Captain.
{36376}{36406}Faster! Faster!
{37315}{37372}l'm sure Kroiga did her best.
{37375}{37421}She shouldn't have failed...
{37686}{37744}Order the Black Shark|back to Blood Rock.
{37750}{37855}Then contact our agents in Japan and|find out about kidnapping Dr. Okada.
{38230}{38286}l better get back to my patient.
{38426}{38482}What happened to the Black Shark?
{38500}{38580}The electronic shield of light|prevents entry into Latitude Zero...
{38582}{38669}...to all vehicles except the Alpha|and a few others that have...
{38672}{38722}...equalizing equipment.
{38734}{38808}It's a sort of regular electric|fence around your ranch, right?
{38811}{38851}In a sense, yes.
{38861}{38916}-Kobo, take over, please.|-Yes, Captain.
{38981}{39034}Who does the Black Shark belong to?
{39036}{39161}To an evil genius named Malic,|and his companion Lucretia.
{39188}{39259}The captain of the Black Shark|is a woman named Kroiga.
{39348}{39435}Formidable opponent.|More skillful than most seamen.
{39504}{39554}Where's this Black Shark from?
{39556}{39663}Malic's base at Blood Rock. It's an|island some distance north of here.
{39675}{39729}And you're always at war|with each other?
{39731}{39859}He lives up to his name. In one archaic|language ''Malic'' means murderer.
{39880}{39979}lf it wasn't for the efforts of Latitude Zero,|he might have taken over your world...
{39983}{40016}...a century ago.
{40030}{40067}A century ago?
{40071}{40131}Yes, we were students.
{40137}{40229}We were friends then,|but he chose one path...I another.
{40231}{40275}Wait, just a minute.
{40286}{40406}Are you saying that you and he were|students together over a century ago?
{40411}{40425}Yes.
{40429}{40482}What? Just how old are you?
{40487}{40607}Well, since you question everything,|I don't expect you to believe this...
{40609}{40669}...or much of anything else|you're about to see.
{40676}{40739}l am two hundred and four years old.
{40741}{40805}Malic is now two hundred and three.
{40873}{40923}How about Dr. Barton...
{40955}{41001}How old does that make her?
{41007}{41039}Mr. Lawton.
{41049}{41149}Even in Latitude Zero, gentlemen|do not discuss the age of a lady.
{41187}{41249}We'll be docking soon.
{43840}{43917}Are we actually at|the bottom of the sea?
{43920}{43988}Yes, a little more than|eleven thousand fathoms.
{43991}{44047}ls taking pictures here forbidden?
{44049}{44068}Not at all.
{44069}{44157}Oh good, because nobody's gonna|believe me unless l show them pictures.
{44159}{44225}They might not even believe me anyway.
{44345}{44373}Gently, Kobo.
{44375}{44387}Yes.
{44494}{44546}-Is he all right?|-He will be better soon.
{44553}{44617}I'll go with him to the|Rehabilitation Clinic.
{45106}{45144}Is that electrically operated?
{45146}{45217}Yes. We have no internal|combustion machines here.
{45219}{45256}So no smog.
{45285}{45375}Kobo, report the malfunction of|the icing equipment and have...
{45377}{45496}...the R and D people make the modifications|on the bow rudders l requested.
{45505}{45528}Yes, Captain.
{45529}{45602}Now, I'll take you to the Great Hall.
{46205}{46263}This is a model of Latitude Zero.
{46269}{46324}Here's the Great Hall where we are now.
{46326}{46353}Fabulous.
{46356}{46387}Who does it all belong to?
{46390}{46427}To the people who live here.
{46430}{46505}But who runs it?|Nothing can operate all by itself!
{46506}{46612}Mr. Lawton, are you skeptical by|nature or because of your profession?
{46614}{46650}I'm a realist.
{46674}{46717}We are the realists.
{46719}{46775}That's why we're not political here.
{46790}{46898}Politics are only needed by people|incapable of running their own lives.
{46943}{46968}I'm sorry.
{46971}{47006}Quite all right.
{47018}{47043}Here you go.
{47118}{47137}Hey.
{47170}{47230}Welcome home, Craig!|How was the volcano?
{47233}{47253}Erupting!
{47290}{47356}Professor Bella, a nuclear physicist.
{47361}{47429}He's made many contributions|to our sunshine.
{47431}{47482}Now we can get much more Vitamin D.
{47506}{47585}Comes up six o'clock in the morning|and dims down at eight at night.
{47613}{47663}Please, change my name to Alice.
{47666}{47760}l didn't take a ride in a bathysphere.|l just fell through the looking glass.
{47763}{47860}Mr. Lawton, you can be very good|company when you aren't glowering.
{47862}{47893}Thank you.
{47912}{47943}Dr. Karnack!
{47956}{48002}Don't you look fine today.
{48084}{48117}Dr. Karnack?
{48120}{48170}Karnack? The Russian mathematician?
{48172}{48184}Yes.
{48196}{48285}He was reported killed in an|air crash five or six years ago!
{48329}{48445}Dr. Tashiro seemed to understand|what I tried to explain about Latitude Zero.
{48450}{48526}But Perry Lawton found it|difficuIt to accept.
{48548}{48633}But he appreciated that the|variety of architectural styles...
{48635}{48717}...in our residential area represented|international tastes...
{48719}{48828}...and reflected the desire to preserve|what was good from the past.
{48849}{48918}Are you trying to tell us|that nobody down here ever...
{48930}{48981}...raises his voice or has an argument?
{48984}{49101}Of course we all do, but arguments are|to solve problems, not bolster egos.
{49174}{49220}Do you understand that, Doctor?
{49222}{49267}-Yes, l do.|-All right.
{49290}{49364}Does everybody down here|wear gold clothing?
{49390}{49429}We use a good deal of it.
{49430}{49481}You mean there are gold mines here?
{49486}{49539}Oh, no. We extract it from sea water.
{49543}{49600}It's inexpensive and very practical.
{49610}{49702}It's getting dark. I'll take you|to the bachelor apartments.
{49710}{49783}You can eat your dinner there|and have a nice rest.
{49785}{49878}Captain McKenzie, where exactly|is Jules Masson now?
{49891}{49979}He is right here.|He's in this Rehabilitation Clinic.
{50298}{50348}Everything is near normal.
{50353}{50441}You see, the cranial bruise|has already healed.
{50459}{50512}The lung puncture has closed.
{50550}{50624}The broken ribs have knitted quickly.
{50637}{50732}The new narrow injections promote|healing in a miraculously short time.
{50753}{50810}Really nothing to be concerned about.
{50813}{50895}All he now requires is ample sleep.
{50907}{50964}When can he be released, Dr. Sugata?
{50970}{51002}In the morning.
{51064}{51110}Goodnight, Dr. Barton.
{51120}{51163}'Night, Dr. Sugata.
{51846}{51875}Come in.
{51974}{51999}Excuse me.
{52041}{52071}Here's the bathroom.
{52073}{52135}Tomorrow morning this closet|will be full of fresh clothing.
{52138}{52191}The YMCA was never like this.
{52205}{52237}Here's the bed.
{52367}{52420}Captain McKenzie!|Is this what l think it is?
{52423}{52448}A diamond.
{52454}{52480}ls it real?
{52483}{52542}Everything in Latitude Zero is real.
{52589}{52659}Do you mind if I take a few|of those stones, Captain?
{52705}{52736}Take all you like.
{52738}{52806}We only use them for|abrasive or cutting tools.
{52843}{52902}That's their only real value to us.
{53171}{53202}Why are you sweating?
{53203}{53281}Because I never was an|instant millionaire before!
{53286}{53333}Thank you very much, Captain McKenzie!
{53352}{53386}Don't mention it.
{53452}{53479}All right.
{53524}{53593}Goodnight, gentlemen.|l'll see you in my office tomorrow.
{53987}{54051}You can't have everything.
{54054}{54071}Hmmm?
{54076}{54134}No moon, no stars in the sky.
{54165}{54298}Those people McKenzie talked to,|or about, they had disappeared...
{54316}{54408}...or they were reported missing|and finally presumed to be dead.
{54439}{54522}Maybe we're in Paradise|and don't even know it.
{54539}{54596}Oh, come on now! I'm serious!
{54651}{54718}You know what, McKenzie|and some of his cronies...
{54720}{54813}...could've kidnapped those people|and brought them down here.
{54819}{54934}And they brainwashed them|into working for him as slaves.
{54939}{54983}You're out of your head.
{54994}{55099}And now he's trying to brainwash us!|You act like he's already gotten to you!
{55104}{55142}He sure has.
{55177}{55238}Or maybe while we were|still out, we were given...
{55240}{55330}...some sort of injections that|might have caused hallucinations!
{55363}{55410}Oh, come on! Perry.
{55415}{55452}No, I mean it.
{55459}{55558}When we come to, we might find we're|just another exhibit in Marineland.
{55722}{55785}What's McKenzie up to now?
{55787}{55842}He's doing something to the Alpha.
{55844}{55930}Every change he makes in it also|makes him more difficult to destroy.
{55993}{56052}lf only there was some way|to puncture that dome...
{56054}{56111}You know there's no way of doing that!
{56113}{56199}We must get him away from there|if we're ever going to get him.
{56339}{56421}This is Malic...|From Tokyo? Go ahead.
{56465}{56506}Dr. Okada has escaped?
{56507}{56534}Escaped?
{56544}{56638}l'm not interested in why or how|you failed to kidnap him in Tokyo.
{56675}{56712}When did he sail?
{56723}{56758}What's the route?
{56781}{56858}Report to our agent in Osaka|and wait for further orders.
{56908}{56987}Dr. Okada and his daughter|sailed from Yokohama last night.
{56990}{57057}The ship is bound for Honolulu,|then San Francisco.
{57062}{57112}Are Latitude Zero agents with him?
{57115}{57142}I don't know.
{57161}{57213}But, we've got to get Okada here.
{57215}{57264}Killing two birds with one stone...
{57267}{57381}I'll get the secret of his immunized|radiation formula and also use him as bait!
{57421}{57451}Don't you see?
{57453}{57544}I'll make sure McKenzie finds out|Okada is here on Blood Rock...
{57552}{57644}...then when he comes to rescue him,|it'll be the end of McKenzie!
{57653}{57733}Yes. So we will lure him to come to us.
{57735}{57791}That's the idea, Lucretia.
{57807}{57868}Now contact Kroiga for me.
{57878}{57996}She has one more mission to perform|before I ''retire'' her from service.
{58104}{58174}I'm very grateful to you for|saving my life, Captain McKenzie.
{58175}{58258}Not at all, Dr. Masson.|She talked me into it...
{58298}{58342}-Good morning.|-Good morning, Captain McKenzie.
{58347}{58395}-Ken!|-Jules! You look fine!
{58398}{58455}Why shouldn't l?|Look who's been taking care of me.
{58457}{58508}Well, they sure got you|up and around fast!
{58511}{58598}Medical science here is so advanced.|They were just minor injuries for them.
{58681}{58718}What's this thing?
{58727}{58788}This is a model of|our special vehicles...
{58845}{58927}...which will be used for transporting|our Project Teams to and from...
{58929}{58962}...Latitude Zero.
{58964}{58990}From where?
{58991}{59029}From all over the world.
{59032}{59107}For instance, this is|the Project Team Three.
{59267}{59317}The chemist is Sir Morris Polley.
{59327}{59374}But, he defected to the Communists!
{59376}{59423}So the Western Press reported.
{59425}{59477}The Communists said nothing...
{59479}{59554}...preferring to let the West believe|he indeed had defected to them.
{59560}{59637}The truth is the Project Team|brought him here where...
{59639}{59715}...he's on pure science|instead of ''profitable'' science.
{59722}{59779}What if he decides he'd|rather go back to London?
{59780}{59829}Oh, we will take him home.
{59879}{59947}That young man is from|Project Team Eight.
{59949}{60030}The man with him is|Sergey Kievsky, the biologist.
{60073}{60151}l thought he took|political asylum in Canada.
{60154}{60188}So you read...
{60191}{60275}The Communists wrote he had taken|his family on a holiday to Egypt.
{60284}{60345}Actually, he is here.
{60392}{60443}Here is Dr. Okada.
{60449}{60529}This was shot three years ago|when he received the Nobel Prize.
{60779}{60862}Every nation in the world tried to|lure him into working forthem...
{60864}{60951}...or steal his discovery.|Malic is one of them.
{61053}{61125}These men are from|Project Team Fourteen...
{61128}{61207}...when they explained Latitude Zero|to him and his daughter.
{61209}{61249}That was last month.
{61252}{61297}And where are they now?
{61307}{61410}They are on their way to Hawaii by ship|to meet members of the Project Team.
{61701}{61735}Father!
{62645}{62692}The ship will radio for help.
{62705}{62815}Aid may come before Kroiga can|get to them aboard the Black Shark.
{62825}{62915}That's so none will risk firing for|fear of injuring our noted guest.
{62919}{63012}Besides, I think we can|count on Kroiga this time.
{63040}{63131}Captain, what's this Okada|done that's so important?
{63136}{63248}He developed a serum that can|immunize against radiation.
{63282}{63324}No wonder every nation wants it.
{63332}{63412}Any one government could immunize|its own population and destroy...
{63414}{63468}...all opposition with nuclear weapons.
{63471}{63558}That's why Dr. Okada has|refused to reveal his formula.
{63572}{63681}But even if these scientists here in|Latitude Zero invent something brilliant...
{63689}{63835}...how is it going to benefit mankind|if you keep the invention down here?
{63854}{63947}We've been thinking about that as well.
{63962}{64045}To encourage new discoveries,|we often secretly give...
{64048}{64140}...our scientific data to the|medical laboratories of the world.
{64509}{64612}The passenger liner en route|from Japan to Honolulu was...
{64615}{64740}...stopped on the high seas by a mysterious|submarine, identity not established.
{64746}{64865}And the Nobel Prize-winning bacteriologist,|Dr. Shogoro Okada and...
{64868}{64970}...his daughter, Tsuruko, were forcibly|taken from the ship by hostile...
{64973}{65013}...persons unknown.
{65016}{65164}...the kidnapping of the famous|scientist is intolerable!
{65194}{65310}At this very moment, our Ambassador|to the United Nations is...
{65318}{65427}...protesting to the Secretary|General about the high-handed act...
{65434}{65492}...of piracy of the United States.
{65496}{65564}...identity of the submarine|has not yet been confirmed.
{65567}{65615}But since it was not American...
{65617}{65716}...the evidence indicated it may have|been either of Soviet design or...
{65718}{65813}...a new aggressive step by Red China.|At the present time...
{65849}{65913}Any report from Project Team H?
{65917}{65988}Team H from Hawaii. Standby.
{65995}{66029}This is Yankton.
{66032}{66130}We have completed the arrangement|to bring the identical substitutes to SF...
{66133}{66213}...to cover Dr. Okada and|his daughter's disappearance...
{66216}{66272}...after taking them to El-Zee.
{66278}{66331}We're now waiting for instructions.
{66337}{66383}None now. Stay put.
{66470}{66523}No! I will tell you nothing!
{66589}{66670}Dr. Okada, you judge us wrongly.
{66681}{66785}If you'd stayed on that ship, you would|have spirited away to Latitude Zero...
{66788}{66843}...never to be heard from again.
{66856}{66908}We are willingly going to that place.
{66916}{66943}I see.
{66955}{67045}If that's your desire, I'll see to it|that you get there...
{67060}{67152}...as soon as you give me the|formula for the immunization serum.
{67155}{67178}Never.
{67236}{67335}Well, you're probably too upset|to think clearly right now.
{67338}{67421}Take a little rest, and|then we'll talk again.
{67475}{67538}Please, Doctor and Tsuruko-san.
{67825}{67920}Do I get a reward for|having brought them to you?
{67922}{68009}Of course, little one.|Just what did you have in mind?
{68013}{68058}To be alone with you.
{68065}{68138}It's been a long time.
{68154}{68180}Too long.
{68197}{68281}Come with me. l'll take you|where we can be together.
{68468}{68496}Kroiga...
{68573}{68620}Wait in here, little one.
{68781}{68808}Oh, no!
{68817}{68844}Malic...
{68872}{68911}Let me out, please!
{68913}{68972}What's that noise? What happened to her?
{68977}{69022}Nothing yet.
{69045}{69083}This way, please.
{69184}{69256}Please, this is our guest room.
{69637}{69738}You can rest here, Doctor,|and think about my proposition.
{69748}{69814}I will not cooperate|with you at any time.
{69833}{69910}Oh, you may change your mind.
{70160}{70210}They are my creations.
{70231}{70315}They will keep you company|for the next twelve hours.
{70409}{70509}Convince your father to cooperate,|or I'll turn you into a creature like that.
{70511}{70542}No, no...
{70561}{70604}You're a monster!
{70618}{70667}No, I am a genius.
{70692}{70760}If you continue to be|obstinate, Dr. Okada...
{70763}{70833}...you will force me to get|your formula in my own way...
{70845}{70944}...by surgically removing your brain,|and then dissecting its memory bank.
{70954}{70995}That's impossible!
{70999}{71038}Not for me.
{71060}{71108}You have twelve hours.
{71800}{71886}Now to let McKenzie know|that I have Dr. Okada...
{72071}{72124}It's originating from this building!
{72126}{72191}Yes, it's Okada.
{72211}{72308}How convenient that they|supplied him with a homing device.
{72312}{72415}Very good. It saves me the trouble|of telling McKenzie where Okada is.
{72420}{72501}-That will bring him here.|-Exactly what I want.
{72509}{72605}We're getting a signal on 87.4.|We'll have its location in a moment.
{72636}{72678}-This is McKenzie.|-Yes, Captain.
{72687}{72764}Have the modifications on the Alpha|I requested been completed?
{72768}{72840}The work is done, but testing will|require at least another day.
{72842}{72920}No time for testing.|She must be ready within one hour.
{72962}{72986}Thank you.
{73082}{73184}The signal is stabilized, therefore|they can't be on the Black Shark.
{73330}{73373}They have to be on Blood Rock.
{73376}{73441}No land or island shows at that point.
{73443}{73492}Small islands aren't shown on maps.
{73494}{73546}How is Dr. Okada sending a signal?
{73549}{73608}We gave him a homing device|before he left Tokyo.
{73610}{73713}Gentlemen, I had planned to return you to|the surface today, but it'll have to wait.
{73716}{73825}Anne, we'll select three men to|go with us on this rescue attempt.
{73836}{73896}What's the matter with us?
{73916}{73985}We're only alive because you saved us.
{73987}{74055}We know how to dive. Let us go with you.
{74077}{74115}I wouldn't miss it.
{74128}{74205}I must warn you the dangers|will be very great.
{74212}{74278}So, how do we start preparing for them?
{74312}{74367}You may need a doctor, Captain?
{74398}{74475}All right, but you'll remain|aboard the Alpha.
{74492}{74570}First, to the Bath of lmmunity.
{74610}{74642}The bath of what?
{74645}{74678}Don't ask me.
{74894}{74974}Now, you see, Gentlemen,|that's how it's done.
{75010}{75081}The immunity only lasts|for twenty-four hours.
{75390}{75459}Submerge for a count of three.
{75863}{75901}Uh, ladies first.
{75904}{75955}I think you'd better go first.
{76296}{76359}You know, l thought|we would look like Easter Eggs.
{76535}{76590}-You'd better be tested too.|-No...
{76727}{76763}Hey, look...
{76810}{76833}Ah, me?
{76906}{76962}l've been hit harder|with ping pong balls.
{77200}{77329}These are made of Corvexo...|an alloy of gold and platinum.
{77358}{77414}Impervious to all temperatures.
{77419}{77505}Hats are just an added precaution,|but you'd better put them on.
{77512}{77559}Then, we'll board the Alpha.
{77576}{77615}-Mr. Lawton.|-Thank you.
{77811}{77861}Have you changed your mind, Dr. Okada?
{77863}{77885}Never!
{77896}{77938}Do you expect to be rescued?
{77940}{78020}The people of Latitude Zero|already know where we are.
{78027}{78117}I certainly hope so. They've had|ample time to pinpoint your location.
{78129}{78218}I didn't take that homing device|away from you on purpose.
{78408}{78438}This is it.
{78499}{78530}Ingenious.
{78557}{78610}Much less obvious than others.
{78625}{78678}But they've served their purpose.
{78723}{78788}Bring them to the operating room.
{79063}{79127}El-zee, El-zee, this is the Alpha.
{79130}{79225}-This is El-zee.|-Are you still hearing the homing device?
{79230}{79283}It stopped, twelve seconds ago.
{79503}{79563}No...no...no...Malic...
{79567}{79612}Please, don't!
{79615}{79670}Please, no, Malic...
{79672}{79740}No, no, please...Malic!
{79743}{79781}Don't...don't...
{79784}{79850}No, Malic, help me!
{79863}{79926}Malic, don't...
{79997}{80086}You're a monster...a fiend...damn you!
{80091}{80174}I hope you die...die...die...
{80305}{80421}While we're waiting for the arrival of|your benefactor, l'll demonstrate my skill.
{80434}{80539}l am going to create a creature that|will kill Captain McKenzie for me.
{81242}{81293}This is the Helio Elevation Belt.
{81297}{81417}Rocket-powered, it permits a person to|climb to high altitudes very quickly.
{81436}{81478}Here is the safety.
{81498}{81538}Here's the trigger.
{81542}{81618}Now these are dangerous|and diverse weapons.
{81651}{81692}In the fingers.
{81744}{81824}The first finger emits a jet of fire.
{81831}{81878}-A miniature flame-thrower?|-Yes.
{81891}{81962}The second finger releases|a paralyzing gas...
{81976}{82026}...that immobilizes but does not kill.
{82029}{82086}But it won't immobilize ourselves?
{82091}{82166}The Bath of Immunity and|Corvexo suit will prevent that.
{82189}{82278}The third finger discharges a|laser beam that is lethal up to...
{82292}{82335}...one hundred meters.
{82351}{82434}Each finger is fired by|its own switch on the wrist.
{82438}{82549}Under no circumstances are you to use any|of these weapons unless I specifically...
{82552}{82602}...give you the order.
{82949}{83008}I can't stand it! No!
{83115}{83156}Can you see?
{83168}{83216}The brain of this lion.
{83425}{83511}Your doctors are so elated that|they have finally been able to...
{83513}{83586}...transplant organs|from one human to another.
{83589}{83632}That's child's play.
{83635}{83737}I'm now going to transplant a human|brain into the head of this lion.
{83744}{83824}My God, no! Don't kill that woman!
{83835}{83930}Think of it, Dr. Okada, a|human's brain in a savage beast!
{83946}{84022}lt will be able to understand|and obey my orders.
{84024}{84114}Ah, what a marvelous creature|this is going to be!
{84133}{84196}I beg you.|Don't do such a terrible thing!
{84199}{84282}I'll give you the formula.|Only stop this, and let her go!
{84290}{84345}It's too late, Doctor.
{84632}{84717}There is a ledge below at eighty feet.
{84742}{84879}After we leave, submerge and|let the Alpha settle on it.
{85244}{85337}The Alpha has surfaced|beside the cliff wall.
{85350}{85423}Administer the anesthetic to the condor.
{85548}{85597}You are to remain on that ledge...
{85600}{85668}...until you receive a radio signal|from me to surface.
{85692}{85766}If you fail to receive|that signal by dusk...
{85820}{85899}...you are to return to|Latitude Zero immediately.
{85916}{85969}Is that understood? Immediately.
{85972}{86006}Yes, Captain.
{86164}{86191}Be careful.
{86207}{86228}Yeah.
{87531}{87563}Malic, look!
{87734}{87776}McKenzie has arrived!
{87777}{87866}Now watch and see what happens|to him and his little group.
{88104}{88168}The moon looks a lot more|inviting than this place.
{88171}{88224}Captain, you've never been here before?
{88229}{88252}First time.
{88262}{88317}How are we going to find Dr. Okada?
{88320}{88365}Could be in that tower.
{88380}{88428}It looks like this is the way down.
{88683}{88710}My legs...
{88712}{88749}What is this?
{88790}{88839}lt's a strong magnetic force.
{88876}{88936}lt has locked the lever|on our elevation belts!
{89198}{89217}Captain!
{89253}{89359}Kobo, try to pull us out. One at a time.
{89454}{89497}They're getting loose!
{89625}{89645}Malic.
{89653}{89708}Be quiet. This is important.
{89868}{89924}Kroiga, do you hear me?
{89957}{90054}You see, Dr. Okada! My new|creation even knows its name!
{90083}{90193}And this amplification serum will increase|the size of it at least three times.
{90197}{90249}All within a few minutes.
{90433}{90487}Kroiga! Come here!
{90559}{90648}lt cannot be...|a beast with the brain of a human!
{90819}{90895}Go! Find McKenzie and kill him!
{90969}{91022}Yes! Kill McKenzie!
{91025}{91094}You understand? Kill him!
{91181}{91268}Now Dr. Okada, it is your turn.
{91317}{91355}No, no!
{91600}{91628}Silence her!
{92016}{92033}Hurry!
{92674}{92712}Doctor, doctor!
{92729}{92761}Are you all right?
{92948}{92996}I suppose you should be all right.
{93002}{93037}You're right.
{93511}{93536}Rats!
{94354}{94403}Go back to the entrance of the tunnel!
{94937}{94981}Let's go through this space.
{96104}{96143}Maybe we can wade across.
{96166}{96193}I'll go.
{96598}{96645}Let's get his boots off, Ken.
{96658}{96690}Knife!
{96964}{96999}Captain, Captain!
{97401}{97432}Can you walk?
{97434}{97463}l'm okay.
{97481}{97522}Jules, get back here.
{97544}{97596}Grab him. Two on each side.
{97615}{97661}Activate your elevation belts!
{98642}{98669}Kroiga!
{98711}{98736}Kroiga!
{98798}{98893}Kroiga was a fool as a woman.|ls she also a fool as a griffin!?
{99170}{99238}Shall we start, Dr. Okada?
{99283}{99383}Please, please don't hurt my father!
{99926}{99972}-Break the lock, Kobo.|-Yes, Captain.
{100290}{100322}Pass me a syringe.
{100513}{100540}McKenzie!
{101258}{101284}Lucretia!
{101334}{101360}Lucretia...
{101393}{101439}Forgive me.
{101467}{101512}I didn't mean to kill you.
{101518}{101551}I know.
{101632}{101662}Malic...
{101797}{101821}Kill him!
{103368}{103403}Ah! Malic!
{104519}{104546}Thank you!
{104555}{104580}Thank you.
{104591}{104613}Father!
{104615}{104644}Tsuruko!
{104681}{104707}Father!
{104732}{104795}-Are you Captain McKenzie?|-We'll talk later, Dr. Okada.
{104803}{104841}Malic has escaped.
{104846}{104899}We must hurry back to the Alpha.
{104947}{104967}Captain!
{106863}{106958}This is Dr. Okada, and this is Tsuruko.|Dr. Barton will assist you.
{106961}{106995}Nice to meet you.
{106999}{107048}Where's Jules...Dr. Masson?
{107058}{107123}He's still up there|with Kobo and Mr. Lawton.
{107139}{107187}We have to go back to help them down.
{107190}{107255}-Are they all right?|-Yes, but Malic has escaped.
{107258}{107280}Ready!
{107283}{107298}Yes.
{107815}{107850}Is that what l think it is?
{107853}{107884}The Black Shark!
{107888}{107911}Let's go!
{108586}{108620}Inside, everybody!
{108623}{108635}Hurry!
{110592}{110664}Try to overcome this force, my friend!
{110700}{110750}We are being pulled by a|strong magnetic force.
{110810}{110895}We're in a magnetic field|coming from that cliff!
{111334}{111383}-Prepare the laser gun.|-Yes, sir.
{111427}{111542}l'm going to destroy the Alpha and|everyone on her, piece by piece!
{111701}{111756}-Cling to something...|-What's going to happen?
{111759}{111828}We'll test a modification|made just before we left.
{111830}{111905}Kobo, activate bow rudders.
{111922}{111948}Yes, Captain.
{112238}{112298}lf this works, we're going to fly.
{112342}{112360}Fly?
{112546}{112583}Now or never.
{112920}{112940}Fire!
{112948}{112969}Fire!
{113279}{113345}Shoot it down! Shoot it down!
{113890}{113922}Move!
{114122}{114167}Out of my way!
{114249}{114297}Sir! We are being pulled to land!
{114300}{114328}Don't bother me!
{114756}{114881}How ironic. lt looks like the Black Shark|has been caught in the magnetic field!
{115383}{115433}Sir, look out!
{117033}{117068}We did it!
{119216}{119321}I've told them goodbye and l wished them|luck which l figure they've already found.
{119334}{119389}A logical conclusion|for a good reporter.
{119392}{119423}Have a chair.
{119434}{119454}Thank you.
{119459}{119541}I suppose you're anxious to|get back to your own world.
{119543}{119622}Well, with the terrific story l've got,|plus the pictures to prove it...
{119626}{119740}...and a tobacco pouch full of diamonds,|it's the only place to go.
{119746}{119794}Uh, Captain McKenzie...
{119806}{119921}You said everything invented down here|is used forthe benefit of mankind, right?
{119993}{120090}When are you going to let the rest|of the world know about this secret?
{120103}{120189}Mr. Lawton, unfortunately we don't know.
{120194}{120308}But we do believe that the day all men|in the world live in harmony will come.
{120328}{120421}Until then, we must|continue our work here.
{120513}{120592}Kobo, arrange to return|Mr. Lawton to the surface.
{120594}{120626}Yes, Captain.
{120636}{120663}Good luck.
{120670}{120696}Thank you.
{121427}{121480}Captain, excuse me.
{121510}{121585}How much longer before the|spacecraft splashes down, Captain?
{121587}{121689}The American officers aboard tell us|that re-entry should begin at...
{121693}{121735}...eleven hundred hours.
{121738}{121817}Raft adrift off starboard bow, sir!
{121984}{122014}Oh, over there!
{122119}{122155}I've told you already.
{122158}{122250}Dr. Tashiro and Dr. Masson|decided to remain in Latitude Zero.
{122262}{122292}I told the captain...
{122294}{122359}-At the bottom of the ocean?|-Yeah, it's the truth!
{122364}{122417}Those scientists who we think are dead...
{122420}{122506}...are alive and studying|down there. I saw them!
{122859}{122888}What is this?
{122891}{122963}He seems to think I'm Dr. Tashiro.
{122991}{123028}lf you please, Gentlemen...
{123057}{123121}l'll be in the radio room|with Lt. Hastings.
{123123}{123152}Thank you.
{123270}{123305}What are you doing here?
{123308}{123388}I'm temporarily assigned|to this ship to observe the...
{123390}{123466}...pick-up of a space-craft,|Commander Glenn McKenzie.
{123473}{123556}You look exactly like|Captain Craig McKenzie.
{123722}{123807}Now, you can see for yourself|the pictures l took!
{123904}{123955}-Nothing on this film.|-What?
{124088}{124113}Look...
{124124}{124138}What?
{124146}{124226}That's his lousy darkroom|that ruined my film.
{124236}{124292}I took pictures of everything there.
{124318}{124345}Wait a minute!
{124394}{124441}l can prove it to you.
{124578}{124615}You see this...
{124979}{125036}It was full of diamonds.
{125072}{125127}Captain McKenzie gave them to me.
{125150}{125199}I come from a long line of McKenzies.
{125201}{125289}But I don't know anyone in my family who|was rich enough to give away diamonds.
{125320}{125382}Lt. Hastings, bring a corpsman|to the wardroom.
{125384}{125402}Right, sir.
{125405}{125429}Thank you.
{125446}{125582}Until this mission is completed,|you will be cared for in sick bay.
{125635}{125681}But I'm not sick!
{125696}{125782}You are all so hung up|on exploring space.
{125785}{125904}You're not even interested in learning|about a miracle that exists on our own planet.
{125914}{126021}When this miracle that|you have seen is demonstrated...
{126048}{126113}...we'll be most interested, Mr. Lawton.
{126167}{126214}Here's the patient, Lt. Hastings.
{126343}{126368}But you...
{126398}{126445}-Bring him to a sick bay.|-Yes, sir.
{126883}{126925}Telegram, Captain.
{127069}{127129}It's from New York Bank to Perry Lawton.
{127140}{127174}Listen to this...
{127189}{127292}''Have received six hundred karats|of diamonds from unknown sender...
{127295}{127382}''...instructing we hold for safe|keeping pending your return.''
{127394}{127445}How did they know|he was aboard this ship?
{127447}{127544}At any rate, he is|the richest man aboard.
{127566}{127618}Here is one from SOPAC, sir.
{127622}{127736}The rendez-vous area is now Tango X-Ray|for splash-down of the spacecraft.
{127739}{127795}Ask the captain to change course.
{127799}{127821}Captain!
{127851}{127909}Longitude one seven six.
{127926}{127960}One seven six.
{127963}{127989}Latitude...
{128004}{128031}Latitude...
{128051}{128070}Zero.
{128081}{128101}Zero.
{128491}{128578}THE END
Hey, hold it. Whoa. Whoa!
Here, look at this.
- Why, it's a skull.
- You mean off some dead fella?
- It looks like stone to me.
- Hey!
Look at those dead eyes.
- Get a load of those gnashers.
- Eh!
Hey! Careful with it. It's a fossil.
It may be worth money, you know that.
I've known things dug out that have fetched a fortune.
Ah, nix. Right!
POLICEMAN: Come along now, please.
Unless you're passengers or press, keep the entrance clear.
Come along now, please.
RONEY: The London Transport people very sensibly ordered all work on the site to cease.
And, at that point, the Nicklin Institute was called in and we started digging.
We made our first dig about there, you see, and that's where Square Five is now.
- We think that's another scapula.
- WOMAN: Huh?
A shoulder blade. How is it, Miss Judd?
It seems to be better than the others.
There appear to be six bodies here at least.
Now, if you'd all just step up this way.
What's that?
Don't worry, gentlemen, the train won't come through here.
No rails.
Now, gentlemen, this little press conference hasn't entirely met with official approval.
Uh, may I say that?
The fact is I need your help.
In the last two days, my assistants here have done wonderful work and we've unearthed a lot of valuable stuff.
- Valuable?
- How valuable, Dr Roney?
To science? I can't tell yet, but I do know this is one of the most remarkable finds ever made.
Now, what I want to say to you is this...
The London Transport people have halted their extension work for the next few days.
But it isn't days we need here, it's weeks.
I know, and you all know, they'll soon be under pressure to start again, to stop wasting public money.
That's where I need your help.
Tell the public why we should be allowed to stay.
Dr Roney, what actually makes this find so remarkable?
These fossils prove, I firmly believe, that creatures essentially resembling mankind walked this earth as long ago as five million years.
Isn't that much further back than has been supposed?
- Yes. A good deal.
- That's tremendous.
Can you actually prove it?
No, not until I've got every scrap of evidence out of here and made full tests.
It's just my personal conviction based on what we've found so far.
And what actually have you found so far?
Parts of two skulls, fragments of upper and lower limbs.
Gosh! And can you actually tell what these, what, ape men looked like?
Hardly, at this stage.
Yes, I think I can.
At least I'm prepared to take a chance.
Uh, Bert. Excuse me.
This is my attempt at a reconstruction.
The modelled parts show what we've found up to now, filled out with imaginary flesh.
He wasn't very big. He had the face of an ape.
He had a big brain and he stood like a man.
- Miss Judd.
- Miss Dobson, what is it?
I've struck what seems to be a buried pipe.
RONEY: What we must have now is time.
We've got to get public support or there'll be tube trains running over this site, bones and all, before we can get everything out.
Whatever it is, it's big.
- A main water pipe perhaps.
- LT INSPECTOR: Not here.
A sewer then?
That would be awkward, wouldn’t it?
Good thing I wasn't using a pickaxe.
There shouldn't be anything.
BARBARA: Dr Roney.
- Anything wrong?
- You'd better have a look.
There is just one possibility.
- Good morning. This way please, Captain.
- Good morning.
- This is Dr Roney.
- Where's the bomb?
Here.
That's right, tear it all up!
What would you say it was, sir?
Uh, looks like a big one.
Maybe a Satan.
Yes, sir, except I've never seen a Satan with bumps.
POTTER: Mmm.
POTTER: Strange.
Won't hold.
No ticking.
Odd though.
The mike doesn't stick, so it can't be steel, and there's no corrosion of the surface.
Feel it.
We'll dig down a bit.
Let the dog see the rabbit, mmm?
Corporal Gibson, two men with shovels.
Right, Sergeant. All right. Webster, Jenkins.
Right, Sergeant, five minutes.
Five minutes.
You know, I don't think this is any kind of metal.
Then what, sir?
Captain Potter, can you tell me yet how long this is going to take?
I realise it must be difficult.
Look, sir, I advised you to leave.
Yes, I know.
But you'll appreciate I have a special interest.
- How long would you say?
- I don't know, yet.
You're a young man. You can't possibly have had the wartime experience that would...
I should call in a second opinion. Is that it?
- Well, yes.
- Well, don't worry. I intend to.
GM2.
Just a moment, sir.
It's for Colonel Breen.
Oh, I'll take It. Scrambler?
No, it's blue. It's clear.
Hello? I'm afraid
Colonel Breen is not available.
What's it about?
A bomb?
But surely you realise he's no longer connected with...
How big?
Good God.
Give me the details.
I'll get the message to him as soon as he's free.
What is there to argue about?
The purpose is quite clear.
Colonel Breen, my Rocket Group has been intended all along for peaceful scientific research.
Professor Quatermass, your Rocket Group?
Yes, mine.
I brought the whole thing into being.
But it is, after all, a government project.
And now the government has had a change of policy.
Change of policy!
You're going to take it over and pervert it to this... This...
Listen. Within 10 years, there will be permanent bases on the moon, perhaps even on Mars.
- Military bases.
- BREEN: Of course.
The present world situation makes that quite clear.
Whoever plants them first will be able to police the Earth with ballistic missiles.
So, we must be in the race.
Well, of course.
The ultimate weapon. It always is.
Gentlemen, don't you see?
We're on the edge of a new dimension of discovery.
It's a great chance to leave our vices behind, war first of all.
Not to go out there dragging our hatreds and our frontiers along with us.
Frankly, I'm surprised and disturbed to hear such naive views still being put forward...
- Naive? You've lost touch with humanity.
- There is nothing to be gained...
You've been shut away too long in this ivory fortress of yours.
That's your trouble.
HOWELL: Well, he'll be out of it soon.
Colonel Breen is joining you at the Rocket Group.
- What?
- HOWELL: At the end of the week.
I think you'll agree that someone with experience of military rockets, missiles, will be of considerable value.
I'll fight this right at top-level!
HOWELL: I shouldn't. It came from there.
It'll work out. For the good of the Group.
And now, gentlemen, if you'll both excuse me,
I have another meeting.
Nose to the grindstone.
I won't resign, if that's what you want.
Of course not.
I'm sure we'll get along quite well.
Why not have dinner with me? My club?
Come.
Oh, I can't possibly... Who's this from?
Oh, I see.
Do you ever find your early career catching up with you?
I never had a career. Only work.
What was yours?
Enemy missiles.
Do you mind stopping off on the way for a couple of minutes?
Lead on, please.
Captain Potter, sir.
- I hope you didn't mind my...
- Any sign of the mechanism yet?
None, sir. We've found this cavity, but there's only impacted clay inside.
- Stand down for a moment, Briggs.
- Yes, sir.
Any guesses?
- Possibly a German V weapon.
- Why?
A flying bomb? A V-2 Rocket?
- It's not either of them.
- Obviously.
But they weren't the only surprises they cooked up in the war.
There were more than anyone knew.
- Sir!
- What is it?
I don't know. It may just be a stone.
CLEGHORN: It's another one of them skulls.
- Corporal.
- CORPORAL: Sir.
- Is Dr Roney still here?
- Yes, sir, I'll fetch him.
- POTTER: It's a skull.
- Let me see.
- Thanks.
- Who is this man?
- Potter, is he attached to you?
- No, sir, that is...
Let me go! Thank you.
Don't you know?
Dr Roney's the man of the moment.
This place is news.
He has no business here now.
Hasn't he?
Thank you. It's absolutely marvellous.
Oh, it's magnificent!
Better than anything we've got so far.
It's almost intact.
- Intact?
- Yes, yes.
This proves everything. It's all I needed.
- No, no, leave it to me.
- You might drop it. It's slippery.
- Drop it? Not on your nelly!
- Here.
How do you think it got inside there?
Oh, it was here in the clay, when the missile struck, it got rammed through.
(SCOFFING) Unbroken? A fragile fossil?
Dr Roney, my name's Quatermass.
Are you one of these bomb experts?
- Not exactly.
- Miss Judd here will look after you.
- QUATERMASS: How do you do?
- Hello.
RONEY: I've got to get this skull under treatment.
That skull seems remarkably well-preserved.
Yes, isn't it? Far better than the first.
What do you think protected it?
Huh? Oh, it was inside the... Inside that...
Good Lord!
I was so concerned just now, I didn't realise.
It was inside. That's no bomb.
Whatever is it?
How old is this fossil skull?
About five million years. It could be more.
Excuse me.
And these are all the Civil Defence records of the area?
- That's right, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Breen, I'd like a word with you.
- Just a moment.
Now, you're quite certain?
There were no HE bombs on the street above here, sir.
Just a few incendiaries, and they only did damage because the houses were empty.
Empty?
Evacuated. Thank you, Sergeant.
Come on, Potter.
Let's have another look at this thing.
Excuse me, sir, but that's not quite right.
Oh? Why?
Those houses were all abandoned years before the war.
- What on earth for?
- Well, people just wouldn't live there.
Some kind of scare.
- Scare?
- Superstition.
A lot of nonsense, I dare say.
There, that's done.
Now, I do think you ought to get a breather.
The air's terrible down here.
All right, but just for a minute.
ELLIS: These are the houses, sir.
Or what's left of them.
- They really are derelict.
- Mmm.
Give me that torch, will you? Thank you.
I must warn you, these buildings aren't safe.
Nevertheless...
I've been reckoning it up.
They must have been empty 40 years now.
- Are you a local man?
- Yes, sir.
- Do you remember what happened?
- Yes, I do.
Oh, it was in all the papers.
Of course, I was only a nipper at the time, but I knew a kid that lived in one of these houses.
Things got so bad they had to clear out.
What got bad?
Noises, bumps, and even things being seen.
You mean ghosts?
(STAMMERING) I said it was a lot of nonsense, sir.
But, you know how these tales run wild once they get started.
Those marks. What could have made them?
Kids, sir.
Kids playing around made 'em.
Sorry about that, sir.
Must've been a bit warm inside there.
Yes. Thank you.
BREEN: Everything in order?
POTTER: Yes, sir.
Ah, Quatermass, I've decided to stay on this case for a day or so,
- if you're agreeable.
- Of course.
You go back to the Rocket Group.
I'll join you there later.
As a matter of a fact, I'd like to hang on, too.
- If you're agreeable.
- As you wish.
I've arranged for an extra squad to work all night.
The entire missile should be exposed by the morning.
- Can I?
- Oh, no, thanks. I'll find my own way.
Sorry about the dinner. Some other time.
Miss Judd!
We'd better get down and give your boss a hand.
He'll be expected to get his gear away.
BARBARA: Hob's Lane.
QUATERMASS: They've changed the spelling.
New one's like Hobbs the cricketer.
But the old one...
Hob was once a sort of nickname for the Devil.
Oh, Quatermass, come in. Come in.
- Well...
- QUATERMASS: Hmm.
Our daily work. Business as usual, no matter what happens at Hobbs End.
- Electronics?
- We don't just dig with trowels, you know.
Not all the time. Would you like some coffee?
- Thanks.
- Have you had a cup, Mr Johnson?
- Yes, I have, thanks.
- Don't nod.
Mr Johnson's kindly obliging us for some tests.
You see, some of his skull dimensions happen to match those of our friend here who died in the second ice age.
- I'm real primitive.
- (LAUGHING) We all are, Mr Johnson.
- Now, are you ready for another run?
- Yes, sir.
Right. Recorder on.
Oh, Mr Johnson, proceed with this puzzle, will you?
That hook up, something special?
RONEY: It can locate the minutest areas of the brain.
We take readings and analyse them in the computer here.
We're gradually building up a picture of what that ice age man might have been able to think and do.
The Roney Analysis. I like it.
I'm hoping to apply it next to the Hobbs End skulls.
Of course, they're so much older.
They'll have even fewer points of resemblance to...
Well, to Mr Johnson, but we hope enough to...
Roney, were they of this Earth?
Ah, I see. That's what brought you here.
Were they?
I'm sorry to disappoint but the answer's only, "Yes, they were".
They were earthly creatures as much as you or I.
They were our remote ancestors but they themselves had ancestors going back as far as 30 million years.
Well, how can you be sure?
They fit into the known pattern of evolution.
The only odd thing about them is the great size of the skull.
I've got it all charted somewhere.
Where the devil does she keep everything?
QUATERMASS: Your Miss Judd?
Yes. I told her to take the day off and get some rest.
Well, I must be getting along.
- To Hobbs End?
- Yes.
Look, I can't seem to lay my hands on it at the moment.
I'll show you next time, for what it's worth.
Next time, I'll have a lot more questions.
Yes. They're piling up, aren't they?
- Are you coming?
- RONEY: I've been told to keep out of it.
Your colleague doesn't like my face.
- Colleague?
- Your Colonel Breen.
- Oh.
- Anyway, it's mutual.
I'm sorry, Quatermass, he's a type I loathe on sight.
Full marks, Dr Roney. Well, it's a long story.
I'll tell you sometime.
Ah, Professor Quatermass.
I've something to show you.
I thought you were taking the day off.
No, I was having these made.
I'm sorry, I'm due at the excavation.
Please read these first.
- Photocopies.
- From old newspaper files.
"May 19th, 1927.
"Hob's Lane spook.
Figure that walked through a bedroom wall. "
Why did you do this?
Well, you seemed curious, too, last night.
I've slept on it since.
Look, read this one.
"The figure was small, " said Mr Parker.
“Like a hideous dwarf. "
No, my dear, we're both scientists.
We simply can't pay regard to stuff like this.
- The supernatural!
- Professor Quatermass!
"August, 1927.
"Curious crowds at Hob's Lane became so large
"that work was held up on the new underground railway station. "
Station. That's when they built it?
They were digging near the same spot.
- BREEN: Ah, good morning.
- Good morning.
You've been busy.
You've cleaned out the inside.
- Yes.
- Find anything?
- Only impacted clay.
- Nothing else?
No, it's been cleared inch by inch and finally hosed out with water.
- So far, it seems to be just an empty shell.
- Hmm, let me see.
- Now, just a minute.
- What's going on?
A test.
All right, Potter, that's got to be enough.
- No effect, sir.
- There's got to be.
I don't understand that at all.
The heat's been on that for a full five minutes and it's not even warm.
POTTER: Do you want to try again, sir?
No. There's no chance of cutting a hole through that.
We've found what seems to be a sealed compartment.
What?
You'd better put some gloves on, sir.
Why?
The sergeant's got a touch of it, too.
Like frostbite, mild though.
Thank you, Sergeant.
- From touching this?
- I don't see how, sir.
It's not cold, but...
What's this?
Oh, it's only our pump.
We had a bit of a flood when we washed it down.
Careful! It's like glass in here.
I see. Blocked right across.
Yes, sir.
So, unless it's solid, there's something on the other side of that.
It could be a warhead.
(SCOFFING) Says Colonel Breen.
- Hello, what made these marks?
- Marks?
Not us. This stuff's harder than diamond.
We've tested.
Well, there seem to be...
Have you got a cloth?
Something to wipe it down with.
- Good grief!
- They form a pattern.
More exactly, they form a pentacle.
One of the cabalistic signs used in ancient magic.
I suppose I'd better mention this to the colonel?
No. It wouldn't fit in with warheads.
Sergeant, get this pump out of the way, will you?
Sir. Right. Two men to shift the pump.
West, inside and clear the hose.
Look sharp, West.
Resistant to heat of 3,000 degrees.
Harder than diamond.
Why, it's the material every rocket engineer's been looking for.
What are you trying to say?
That the Germans didn't make this and then lose the secret.
You ask Von Braun.
If I can get through that bulkhead,
I won't need...
Try Borazon.
It's a lot harder than diamond.
Can you get hold of a Borazon drill?
It would mean getting hold of a civilian operator.
POTTER: West!
(STAMMERING) It was... It was a figure.
It went through.
It went straight through the wall!
I saw it! I saw it.
Horrible. Horrible.
BREEN: Is he ill?
QUATERMASS: He may be.
CLEGHORN: All right, West. Take it easy, lad.
I thought it was the wall shining and then it came straight at me.
- Horrible!
- Come on.
Westie's got the horrors.
- What did he see, sir?
- Nothing. The confined space affected him.
A man like that should never have been on this job.
- Now pull yourself together, West.
- Sergeant, that's not the way.
- What did you see?
- I don't know.
You... You said a figure.
Yes, sort of crooked.
It went straight through.
Here.
It was horrible. Horrible!
With its head tucked underneath its arm?
Oh, shut up!
I did see something, sir.
I did, honest. It was little.
"The figure was small, like a hideous dwarf. "
Yeah, that's it.
Here, what made you say that, miss?
How did you know?
It's all right. Here.
Get him away from here. He'd better go sick.
Yes, I'll write a note to the MO.
Captain Potter, he'd better not talk to the other men.
POTTER: Come on.
Do you mind?
Normally, I don't before noon, but...
Thanks.
BREEN: Is that pump clear yet?
GIBSON: Yes, sir.
- Get rid of the oxyacetylene cutter.
- Sir.
Don't make any attempt to drill that bulkhead until I get back.
- Where are you going?
- To find something out.
May I? I think we should follow this up.
"Alarming noises and spectral appearances.
September, 1 763. "
Listen. "Our informant further states
"that grievous sounds emanating from the very earth
"have so affrighted certain fellows employed in the digging of a well
"that one is like to die mad. "
Digging a well?
Do any of the others mention that?
Not so far.
Stories, wild rumours.
They believed in those days.
I suppose it's possible for...
For ghosts, let's use the word, to be phenomena that were badly observed and wrongly explained.
Listen.
"One inhabitant of Hob's Lane doth assert
"he hath oft espied the apparition of a hideous goblin.
"And once, several. "
"Several"?
"And that this place is long notorious for weird happenings. "
Where next?
(SIGHING) The archives of Westminster Abbey, I think.
Uh, "In the winter of the year 1341,
"the religious of that region
"did strive against
"an outbreak of evil at Hob's Lane. "
Oh, please go on. My Latin's not up to it.
Yeah. (CLEARING THROAT)
"Imps and demons did appear.
"Foul noises
"sent by the Devil
"did sorely afflict
"the charcoal burners that had lately come there. "
- Charcoal burners?
- Yes.
Yes, yes, that's right.
They'd be felling trees.
Big, heavy ones.
In 1763, a well was being dug.
In 1927, the underground station.
And now the extension.
All disturbances of the ground.
"This has well been known as a troubled place.
"It is said that, in the time of the Romans... "
I'd better go.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, I have to leave now, but Miss Judd will stay on.
Find out everything you can.
Then collect Dr Roney.
I think he should be in on this.
Uh, many thanks.
Hang it on the grille there, Sergeant.
Ah, Professor,
I've orders to let no one down there.
- What's he doing?
- He's got that drill set up, sir.
The one you suggested.
I asked him to wait.
Powered from this, I suppose.
Yes, sir. Better than the public supply, just in case.
In case it blows up?
That's why he won't let anyone down there, sir.
Oh, very considerate of him.
Oh, I reckon this little beauty would cut through anything.
I did steel armour plate with it.
Six inches thick.
(WHISTLING) Just like that.
Oh, it was legal.
The bloke got shut in a strong room.
But I got him out.
It was a secret job, like this one.
Then I'm glad you don't talk about it.
Ah, Quatermass.
Breen, I think we should hold everything for a time at least.
I can explain.
We're going ahead now.
Hello, Potter?
Right, sir.
All clear!
-Right.
You can get clear if you want to.
There's still time.
Welcome aboard, mate.
Have they started?
That's it.
Do you know what's inside there?
Are you insured? I'm insured.
It's a good thing to be insured.
At least, it cheers you up.
Okay, sir?
Right, here we go.
Try again.
Try once more.
Get back!
The generator, knock it off!
It wouldn't... It wouldn't...
QUATERMASS: The best thing.
You're shaken up. We all are.
It was the vibration in there.
Some sort of freak vibration. Must have been.
- All right, Sladden?
- Hmm.
The drill, it wouldn't work.
Roney, this sound, everything here, just like the old accounts.
- Did she tell you?
- Yes.
- And there's a pentacle drawn inside there.
- What?
See for yourself.
BREEN: As soon as you can.
Thank you, Sergeant.
I'm all right now, sir, if you want to have another bash.
- Good man.
- Breen, wait.
We ought to have time to consider this.
I have.
We'll blanket down the sound with sandbags.
I've ordered them down.
I will cover up the polished surface.
But it isn't as simple as that.
RONEY: Quatermass.
I thought you said the drill had no effect?
Well, I never made that.
What? But you must have.
SLADDEN: I can't have done.
That's much bigger than my drill bit.
It doesn't look as if it was drilled at all.
Looks more like melted.
All right, Sladden, get out of here.
Look out!
The demons.
QUATERMASS: Wait!
It's all right. They're dead.
They've been dead for a long time.
RONEY: What are they?
Whatever they are, they're decomposing fast.
This is a job for you, I think.
Yes. Barbara!
Phone the Institute.
Tell Klein... No, there isn't time.
Just tell him to keep everybody standing by for the biggest job they've ever had.
Phew! The stench! It is like rotting fish!
Or locusts.
I don't think I dare wait.
They're corrupting so fast. Potter!
Catching up on lost time.
What do you mean by that?
They were sealed in there till our atmosphere got in a few moments ago.
Filthy London air.
They might have stayed unchanged for a year, or a million years.
And as quickly as you possibly can.
Yes, Doctor.
- CLEGHORN: What is it, sir?
- Explanations later, Sergeant.
They want planks and empty sandbags.
- As many as you can find.
- Right, sir.
Give me a hand.
- I can't guarantee my stomach.
- Steady.
Easy now. Got him.
Oh, my God.
Throw down something to put this on.
And a sandbag.
Easy.
Take it up to the platform, will you?
I'll fix it there.
Don't just stand there. Give a hand!
Hold it level. It's leaking.
God.
- What is it?
- They don't know.
Where can it go?
Oh, there.
I'd better take a photograph of it.
- What are you using?
- Number Four sealer.
- Is it safe?
- I'll have to risk that.
If I can just save the shells and some body fluids for analysis.
These shapes suggest some kind of apparatus, instruments.
- Your imagination is running wild.
- Isn't yours?
What?
They don't seem to lead through anywhere.
If there were once any external propulsion units,
I don't see how they were controlled.
Unless...
Unless the missile itself did some of the thinking.
You're mad!
This substance isn't inert. Far from it.
We know that.
Don't tell me what I know!
There's been enough nonsense talked about this... this thing.
Dead for millions of years!
I know the smell of death, believe me, and how short a time it lasts.
- Have you got an explanation for all this?
- Yes, I have.
Then why not share it?
When I choose.
Gauze, quick!
I want you to get some photographs of the compartment they were in.
- Of course.
- It's all dropping to powder.
Soon, there'll be nothing to prove we ever saw it.
Do you classify them as insects?
Arthropods.
Nice, general term, covers all the crabs and spiders, too.
Except that no Earthly ones ever had that tripod leg arrangement.
The horned demons in those old prints.
- Roney, this image...
- Rather pretty.
It's like a gargoyle. I mean, in fact.
Haven't you seen it carved in walls in a dozen countries?
Hidden in the depths of all our minds, a race memory.
RONEY: Got it!
Look at this.
A cave painting of 30,000 years ago.
A man in a ritual mask.
I wonder where he dreamed up the idea of that.
Thanks.
Hmm.
You know, I think these are old friends we haven't seen for a time.
Weight and structure point to low gravity environment.
A thin atmosphere.
Perhaps a world that's dead now, but a few million years ago could have been teeming with life.
I wonder.
A name that's been nearly worn out before anything turned up to claim it.
Was this really a Martian?
ATTENDANT: I'm sorry. The Institute's closed.
It's the same round the main door.
They got us in a state of siege.
Miss Judd, can you do something about this?
Get Dr Roney to call 'em off, or we'll be needing the police.
I'll see what I can do.
And there were how many of these ape creatures?
Seven. Well, six at least we found.
Apes with oversized craniums.
Some faculties had developed in them, or had been developed.
What?
The will to survive. It's an odd phenomenon.
Roney, if we found that our Earth was doomed, say by climatic changes, what would we do about it?
Nothing. Just go on squabbling, as usual.
Yes, but if we weren't men?
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Is it possible to give out a statement of some kind?
The crowd outside's getting huge and a bit ugly.
Are those the photographs you took?
Yes.
Right. Let's show them.
Good idea.
NEWSREADER ON RADIO: "The discovery might have some astounding implications, " added Professor Quatermass.
But, for the moment, he could not say what these were.
You can't go down there, sir, but you can read all about it.
Professor Quatermass, sir.
The Minister's waiting.
He's not pleased.
HOWELL: Hello, Minister's Office.
Good afternoon, sir.
Professor, what you've done appals me.
It's the PM's private secretary.
Sorry, still not available.
Try again in 20 minutes.
Now, it's the PM and the Home Office badgering about cordons and special police action.
- (PHONE RINGING)
- Kill that thing!
HOWELL: Sorry, the Minister is not available.
Now, before they pull a special cabinet meeting on me,
I should like to have just a few answers ready.
How much do you know?
Something from Colonel Breen and what I've read in these.
- Why did you do it?
- People wanted to know.
So you talked.
Without authority or consultation.
Whose authority?
This department's.
It didn't seem to me to concern the Ministry of Defence.
We'll see about that.
Now,
"Astounding implications. "
- (PHONE RINGING)
- Cut that off!
HOWELL: No more calls till further notice.
What did you mean by that?
Dr Roney and I are satisfied that these arthropods are not of this Earth.
So I gathered.
You've been busy hinting at Mars.
Mars is dead.
Nothing there but a few scraps of lichen.
Five million years ago it may have been very different.
Suppose, at that time, there were living beings on it with techniques that enabled them to visit the Earth.
At a time when the most highly-evolved creatures here, our own ancestors, were only a type of Pliocene ape.
Go on.
They may have wanted to found another colony when their own world was doomed, but couldn't endure our atmosphere.
- So they experimented.
- Experimented?
The man apes found beside the missile were abnormal.
Oh, and the insects were responsible.
QUATERMASS:
There's clearly some connection.
My guess is that those were ape mutations being brought back for release on Earth.
BREEN: And you really believe that this was possible?
That apes were systematically taken from this planet to another and...
Altered by selective breeding, atomic surgery, methods we can't guess.
And returned with new faculties instilled in them.
High intelligence.
Perhaps something else.
In effect, a colonisation.
It'd be a way of possessing the Earth.
Only a colony by proxy, but better than leaving nothing at all behind.
Surely, it would have had to be carried out on a huge scale?
Yes, if I'm right...
If I'm right, we've just come on a single instance.
Probably an accident, a landing that went wrong and they all died.
The Thames Valley was swamp then.
You realise what you're implying?
That we owe our human condition here to the intervention of insects!
I suppose I am.
So that's your great theory?
And for that we've had all this splutter and alarm and...
Well, at least we can let the Home Secretary off his beat now.
- Get him?
- Yes.
I wanted to hear you first.
Ministry of Defence here. Howell speaking.
- Give me the Home Secretary.
- Breen, tell him.
Tell him!
I told you I had an explanation.
The Germans in 1944.
Breen, you can't be still hanging on to that.
Professor Quatermass.
You are an expert in certain fields, I in others.
One of my specialisations is weapons, and another, military propaganda.
So, kindly allow me my opinion without interrupting.
I think that when the Germans were losing the war, they tried a propaganda scare.
They sent over an experimental V weapon in order to produce exactly the effect it has produced, thanks to your help.
Though, a little late for their purpose.
- And what about the arthropods?
- Fakes.
Put there as a circumstantial touch.
Like fairground mermaids, made up of old scraps of skin and bone.
It's the oldest trick in the business.
- MINISTER: Hello, John.
- No, sir, wait.
You must hear expert testimony.
I have. Is that missile safe?
Thoroughly checked.
- MINISTER: No danger to the public?
- None, I'm certain.
Hello, John?
I'm sorry you've been led such a dance.
It's all over now.
Well, it was nothing but a gigantic false alarm.
LOUDSPEAKER: Move along. Move along.
This is an official statement.
In spite of incorrect news stories published earlier, the missile found here is believed to be a German propaganda weapon of the last war.
It has now been dealt with and is not dangerous.
Repeat, there is no danger.
A full statement will be issued shortly.
Now move along please.
REPORTER: Inspector, can we go down there and take a look?
Tomorrow. It'll be wide open to all you boys then.
Press, TV, the lot.
These bloody sacks.
Couldn't we have forgotten them, Sarge?
No, Army property, very precious.
Well, you might have let me know you were packing up.
I told you, I was only round the caff.
Very sorry, sir.
I didn't want to interrupt your tea break.
Oh, that's all right, my man.
I'll overlook it this time.
Well, I'd better get my stuff out then.
Hey, come off it. My tool box.
- Bloody Army!
- Right, let's go home.
Uh-oh, where was Moses when the lights went out?
In the flippin' dark.
Excuse me.
Uh, sorry, miss.
The station's closed till tomorrow.
But I must go in. I left a microscope and a box of slides down there.
There's only the emergency lights left on now.
I won't be a moment.
Please, I must have them.
All right, miss. I'll wait for you.
Thank you.
Hey, what's going on here?
Hey! What's going on?
Professor Quatermass? He's in here.
SLADDEN: Hello, miss.
Hello.
- Have you called a doctor?
- No.
When I heard those sounds,
I asked Mr Edwards, the choirmaster, to go and to dismiss the choir.
I knew I must stay alone with this man.
I felt sure he had been in contact with spiritual evil.
I'll have to question him.
Perhaps tomorrow.
No, there may be danger, in waiting, to others.
Sladden?
Can you say what happened tonight in the excavation?
You remember being there?
Well, you stayed to dismantle some equipment.
You were hurt by something flying through the air.
Do you remember objects doing that?
Moving by themselves?
I had to run, to get away. They were coming.
Who? What were?
Them. Them!
No more, please!
I remember it started and then I could only see them like you found down there.
With the eyes and horns and...
He saw the creatures.
SLADDEN: (WAILING) And they were alive!
Alive?
Hopping, like very fast, and hundreds and hundreds!
And I knew I was one.
How did they move?
Jumping, leaping.
- Let him alone!
- Where?
In and out. Them big places.
In and out of them.
Oh, huge! Right up in the sky!
The sky? What colour is it? Blue?
No.
Dark.
Purple.
VICAR: You should have left him alone.
He isn't free of it yet.
- Perhaps it was always in him.
- What do you mean?
In all of us.
An inheritance of dormant faculties.
Clairvoyance, telekinesis.
Scientific terms to explain it all away.
On the contrary, I agree with you.
What's been uncovered is evil.
As anciently diabolic as anything on record.
I think what he gave us just now was a vision of life on Mars five million years ago.
That and the unconscious ability to cause movement.
They're old powers that can be awakened somehow by the thing in the pit.
Shouldn't we tell the Ministry? Warn them?
They wouldn't listen.
We're going to need proof.
- Have you the keys to the Institute?
- Yes.
Good. We'll work from there.
QUATERMASS: Is that the Rocket Group?
Right. It's Quatermass here.
No, no, no.
This is Professor Quatermass speaking.
Now put me on to Mr Watson.
I know he's in bed. Just stir him up.
What's all this about?
Oh, thanks for coming.
I'm afraid I've been grubbing about in your workshop already.
There's something we can do.
Oh, Jerry? Well, wake up.
Now, listen, I want you to bring some gear to London right away.
The special video signal stuff.
As follows. Yes. Now, better take notes.
- (MACHINE HUMMING)
- QUATERMASS: Well, Jerry?
Not a sausage.
No wonder, after bumping the stuff over half the roads in the country.
It's delicate.
Miss, are you sure we're still locked on to those settings?
BARBARA: Quite sure. The signals are still coming through here all right.
I'll check the positive feedback.
Maybe it's Roney.
What do you want me to do?
Ah, just go to sleep. You've been saying for hours how tired you are.
You should have got our friend Johnson.
You can practically read his mind without gadgets.
Are you still hopeful?
He thinks it might work.
Your apparatus to locate the brain centres, ours to translate signals.
If it does, you're...
You're going to try and repeat what Sladden went through?
Experimentally.
You said these faculties may be in all of us.
Poltergeist outbreaks. Second sight.
They've been recorded the world over, throughout the ages.
Myths, magic, even witchcraft.
Perhaps they all came from there.
So as far as anybody is, we're the Martians now?
The unconscious vision centres.
Better shut the grille.
Keep any nosy parkers out.
When the light flickers, switch off.
Right.
It seems to draw energy from any source.
But more so from that generator.
Perhaps by induction.
RONEY: Hold still a minute.
Right.
Now you'll do exactly what Sladden did.
- Once the generator goes off, I use this.
- Yes.
Now, back here for you, my dear.
But if there's anything to photograph...
It'll keep. Right.
Now then, let's get a true reading.
All signals spot on.
- Hmm. When the generator cuts...
- We run on the batteries.
No, I mean, when it cuts, there may not be much time.
I see.
Ready?
Not a thing showing, not a damned thing.
But it's started. Listen to it down there.
- Shh!
- QUATERMASS: Roney!
I'm getting no visual impression.
I'll try a bit longer but I don't think it's operating through me.
Quatermass, try...
Did you get that?
- Yes, yes.
- Wait.
- Now.
- Yes, Quatermass.
It's getting too much for me.
We're not getting you. Shout louder.
I'll have to come out of here.
It's getting too much for me.
I'm coming out!
Let me.
- I can see.
- Barbara!
Quatermass, what's happening?
Roney, it's Barbara. She's the one!
Get down here, quick.
I can see.
Try this.
I can see. I can see!
I can... I can...
I can see.
She's getting something!
Hold me!
Hold me! Hold me!
You're all right. You're all right. Well done.
Well, did you manage to get it?
Yes. I saw them too, on the monitor.
Good. I think now we may have something to show Colonel Breen.
What you're about to see is a memory.
Stored for millions of years in the very substance of that hull, and now picked up by the susceptible brain of this young woman here.
Highly receptive, like the man Sladden.
- More than most of us.
- And what do you claim this will show?
A race purge.
A cleansing of the Martian hives.
Tape ready?
Yes. (CLEARING THROAT)
Most curious.
Those were like the creatures you found?
The same.
You saw that they were killing and being killed.
I think we may have witnessed ritual slaughter, to preserve a fixed society, to rid it of mutations.
Good heavens!
That's the way they lived.
And it's the way they intended their substitutes on Earth to live.
Not again!
My concern is, sir, that this stored memory of killing should be coupled with another power that thing in the pit seems to possess.
The power to redirect human energy.
MINISTER: A power to...
QUATERMASS: Into force beyond control.
- Nonsense!
- Well, we've all felt it.
- You have yourself.
A few vibration effects.
Now, now, gentlemen.
There's no need for this.
We're looking for rational explanations, and there is one.
This truly remarkable apparatus of yours was surely set to detect, was it not, hallucinations?
BREEN: Hallucinations. Exactly, sir.
All right, then, call it a mental image.
Now this young lady certainly has an imagination and she's overwrought.
She's seen the creatures that Colonel Breen insists are fakes.
So, what could be more natural than...
No, sir. You mustn't dismiss it like that.
You prefer that I dismiss
Colonel Breen's theory?
But if you'd been there, if you'd witnessed it all!
Professor Quatermass, I don't believe that you're right in this matter.
You are ridiculously wrong.
You're going to admit people to the excavation?
Yes, tonight.
The press, radio and television.
No, sir. You must not!
My duty now is to quieten public alarm.
And you, up to now a government officer with the same duty, you'll keep your damned paws out of things!
There's a heck of a lot of stuff down there.
Far more than I expected.
All those lamps and TV cameras.
Our generator will take all the load they can put on it, don't worry.
The cameraman want to take some shots inside the thing.
Can you fix them up?
Light the inside? Why not?
I'll get them to run out a further extension.
Right.
And the West German Federal Government has kindly agreed to make a further search of existing wartime records with a view to finally identifying this missile.
HOWELL: Copies of
Colonel Breen's statement are available for those who haven't one.
Now, before we take you down to see for yourselves, any questions?
Yes. Are you sure it's safe?
(CHUCKLING) Quite safe.
Any more questions? Otherwise...
Yes. I've got a question.
Is Colonel Breen just a fool or a coward?
What do you mean by...
- How...
- Just one second.
Professor, I thought it was clearly understood...
Is the Colonel afraid?
So afraid that he resorts to the thinnest rationalisation?
I say what I know to be the truth!
Well, tell them what you've seen down there.
Potter, you were a witness. You tell them.
Sir, we found...
My mate, he's in there!
Potter, be careful.
It's safe. The power's been cut.
I didn't mean that.
- What happened?
- He had the live cable.
He must have slipped!
Right, stand back, please.
Keep clear! Stand back!
He's dead.
It was an accident.
I couldn't help him.
There was nothing I could do.
- I know.
- He was fixing the junction box.
All right, all right!
- It was an accident.
- It may not have been.
What did you say?
Are you trying to make out it was my fault?
Get those lights on!
Hey, put the breakers back in.
Yeah, all except the line to the hull.
What's she doing there?
What is it?
It's coming alive.
It's glowing.
I don't see anything.
I did. Before the lights came on.
Breen, you've got to send everyone out of this place.
What, just because there's been an accident?
No, there's some new activity starting in that thing!
Listen, I'm advising you all to leave.
There may be grave danger.
What's the matter? What's wrong?
Well, you've seen what's happened to the electrician, haven't you?
Gentlemen, gentlemen, the official arrangements will proceed as planned, whenever you are ready.
And now we're taking you over to Hobbs End Underground Station.
Three streets away and we got to see it on the telly.
I tell you, people don't believe nothing nowadays unless they've seen it on the telly.
Edgar, do you believe in these Martians?
Be your age, Kitty.
Good evening. I'm standing just a few yards from where the mysterious missile was dug...
Colonel Breen, perhaps you should...
I'm sorry. Something's wrong here.
MAN: Now they've gone and mucked it up.
KITTY: Funny noises.
EDGAR: Vision on sound that's all.
Have another drink.
KITTY: Yes, I will.
I'm sorry, something seems to have gone wrong with our vision.
You must get away from here.
I tell you, this could be dangerous. Get back!
Get back!
Constable, get these men back from here.
Get back! Get back!
What's he doing there?
Constable, get that man out of here!
Stop panicking! Pull yourselves together!
For God's sake, don't panic!
Got to make a report.
Sir! You must get away from here. Sir!
Quatermass! Quatermass!
Don't you know me?
Roney.
That's better.
Go on, sit down.
Here. It's no way to serve decent whisky, but we're a bit low on glasses.
Now get that inside you.
You stopped me?
That's right. I stopped you.
You were being carried along, so I thought I'd better.
Were they... people?
What?
Of course they were.
- Don't you feel it?
- Feel what?
- Here. Anything?
- No.
Perhaps some are immune. Some few.
I...
I was just leaving the Institute,
I heard shouting in the distance.
It was what I was afraid of.
The thing got a huge intake of energy.
The very substance of it seemed to be coming alive.
And then...
Then you can't see this world any longer!
It's like that now?
No, not so bad now.
Quieter.
Was there anybody left there?
Breen.
It's changing. I can feel it.
It's getting stronger.
Quatermass! No!
Quatermass, no!
It's taking possession of you.
Fight it.
Fight it!
Can you hear what I'm saying?
Think, man, think.
Use your brain. Your memory.
Keep hold.
Yes.
My name is Bernard Quatermass, professor of physics, controller, British Experimental Group.
At present, engaged in...
Engaged in...
I wanted to kill you.
I could have done without moving.
Without trying.
I knew that. And I would have done.
Why? Did you know why?
Because you are different.
I could feel that. You had to be destroyed.
Destroyed.
Listen!
Animals! They're killing the animals.
No, not only animals.
This is the image that was buried in the hull.
The compulsion to preserve their colony.
Destroy all that didn't belong to it.
Draining the whole energy of London to turn it into a Martian colony.
They can't possibly, after so long.
They can. I can feel it. See it. See them.
Resist it. You must!
Come on. We've things to do that maybe nobody else can.
It's the Devil. The horned Devil.
Don't look at it!
Over there.
RONEY: Mass into energy.
The focus of all that's happening.
The cause. Oh, God!
God!
What can we do? Roney, what can we do?
Mass into energy. The fundamental law.
It must be.
- What?
- The Devil’s enemy was iron.
It might make sense if it were possible to project a mass of metal into it, connected to the ground.
Discharge it to the Earth?
- Yes.
- No, it's too simple.
But it's what they'd never allow for, even that scrap of knowledge in minds that were free to use it.
That crane.
I'll try.
- No.
- Yes!
You'll have to go round and stop her.
Huh?
You'll have to go round and stop her.
Barbara!
Roney!
Roney.
