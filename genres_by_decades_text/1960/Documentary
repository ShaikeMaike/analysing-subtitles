If it was only your word, Lucila,
There would be doubt.
Caesar must be undoubted Caesar.
Is it not possible, Lucila that there are
Other ways of becoming the real heir of Marcus Aurelius?
Hail, undoubted Caesar!
Hail Comadeus!
Hail Caesar!
Hail Comadeus!
Hail Caesar!
Hail Comadeus! Hail Caesar!
Hail Comadeus!
I will never forget what you have done today.
Let this be heard over the four corners of the empire
That I Comadeus,
Now Caesar
To proclaim Galius Matheus Levius
Commander-in-chief of all Roman armies.
Proconsul of the Roman empire,
Second only to Caesar himself.
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!
Remember, thou are mortal.
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!
In these buildings
You store all the law,
All the writings of the great men of Rome.
I am leaving with
My husband.
And soon I'll be far from this city.
Now I ask
That you guard these
The meditation of my father
Marcus Aurelius.
Whatever has happened
In the days to come.
Let not this be destroyed.
For this is Rome.
When...
When my father was dying,
I spoke to the gods,
Saying...
I am not like my father.
And if I'm to be crowned Caesar,
I would change all he did.
I offered them my life,
And told them that if it is not for the good of Rome
That I be Caesar,
Then let me be killed.
But you see...
I'm alive.
And Caesar.
Now!
I wish to see Rome once more... the city of light.
Gaiety, the beauty and strength.
We will have games.
The people of the city will be fed.
You & your Eastern provinces will send us
Twice the grain they've been sending
The taxes on them will be doubled.
My lord, Caesar.
This cannot be done.
We have famine,
Not only in our provinces of
Syria and Egypt,
But also in Armenia, Cappadocia
Arabia
In the whole Eastern half of the Roman empire,
People are dying of hunger
When the words spread that
You have sent for us,
It was joy and hope. Our people said,
Rome cannot let us die.
Our Caesar will send us help.
If we carry out these orders,
We risk having the entire East
Rise up against Rome.
You will tell your provinces,
Egypt, Syria,
The entire Eastern half of the empire
That if there is a least resistance to my orders,
I will destroy them.
You will also let them know they must forget
The weakness of my father.
The tribe of Polybus and his legions
Dead march, ambushed.
Barbarians. Human sacrifice. Romans.
Attack!
Balimar! Balimar!
Lay down your weapons and swords.
We have fought each other long enough!
You will never drag me,
And my people to the streets of Rome as slaves.
Balimar!
You or your people will never be slaves!
This I pledge you on my honor!
Caesar will never accept this.
They are prisoners of war.
They must be sold as slaves.
Let us die killing Romans!
Put them in chain! Put them in chain!
So we can talk to them as men.
We are asking only that you give us your words,
And your chains will be removed.
You don't seem to understand.
Galius Matheus Levius
Wishes to remove your chains.
He wishes to make free men,
Free women of you.
Wishes to make you Romans.
Is it that you doubt the word of Levius?
Tell me, I want to help you.
This is Voltran,
Our god of war.
If your gods are stronger than ours,
They will give you strength.
If they are not, you will reach out and touch Voltran.
You are surrounded by Roman soldiers.
At my first scream they will fall upon you and kill you.
We have lost the battle,
Voltran says we must die.
Let us look upon this logically.
You wish to know
If our god are stronger than your god.
One, what will you know if
I touch your god.
What if it's I am weak?
Two...
We wish to help you,
To free you.
If I scream you will all die.
Although I've been a slave,
I'm not accustomed to pain.
All I am is a philosopher,
I am weak.
I'm not worthy of it.
Barbarians!
Monsters! Animals!
Touch Voltran then will know
If your gods are weak.
I cannot,
I cannot bear this.
It's beyond all human endurance.
I cannot.
Oh, Levius.
What a world to
The future rested in such as this.
I have no intention of turning...
My faith was not strong enough!
You did not even scream.
There's no reason to take our god.
That's no reason to change your ways.
What do you want with us Roman?
You miserable, uneducated, half men.
You are not taught of what we fought for
And yet...
We want you.
We want you.
Sister!
If he hasn't been Caesar,
He'll be the greatest gladiator in Rome.
Yes! You do belong in the arena.
You mean to say you me all this way to sharpen your wits.
Everything you do has a purpose.
I came to tell you what your friends dare not.
You are pushing our Eastern provinces to rebellion.
Now I see.
You've come to scold me.
And may I remind, my sister.
That her younger brother cannot be order about and ridicule.
You seem to forget that I'm Caesar.
I do as I wish.
Do you? Do you?
You had only one idea,
To smash and destroy everything father did.
You always resented me, Lucila.
Why?
What have I ever done to you?
It's what you are doing now!
You're lying.
Don't you suppose I know that it was you
Who poisoned father against me.
I did not have to.
The problem is you and the cruel things you did.
How is it that you never knew about the cruel things you did,
Especially to our own mother.
I was in the room when she died.
When our mother died...
Remember!
I heard her beg you.
Lucila,
Why do you hate me so.
If I'd done anything to hurt you,
Forgive me.
And you let her die without a word.
Wasn't that cruelty?
There was a reason.
Reason?
What was it tell me?
Nothing.
Tell me.
Tell me!
Caesar!
You are unarmed.
Even a woman with a dagger
Could be dangerous.
She has no dagger.
She is my sister.
Leave us.
So, you came to warn me.
No other reason.
Didn't you know Levius
Was on his way back to Rome?
I did not know.
Do you know why he is coming?
Stay here with me, Lucila.
We'll find other ways to show the loyalty
Of Armenia.
Galius Matheus Levius.
I heard a whisper that
Lucila is here in Rome.
I do not heard him saying that anything is possible now
That Comadeus has become Caesar.
I've been hearing these wild rumors
That you've come with your head full of ideas,
For a new Rome.
Rome of my father.
I let you intend to come before the Senate.
With these ideas
These wild schemes of yours.
What will you do if I were to say, Levius
I don't want you to do it.
Just that. Nothing more.
I would still do what I believe must be done.
Abandon this plan, Levius.
And I will see to it that you and Lucila can always be together.
Oh, Levius.
Oh, what will I do?
I'm not as strong as I thought I was.
I have not learned to live without you.
There is no life for either us apart Lucila.
I told you this before but you would not listen.
I thought you betrayed my father.
But now I know.
You found your own way of making the world you want.
And yet if I try to make that world,
Comadeus will keep us apart.
Make that world. Levius
And let's see,
What will keep us apart.
Hail Levius, conqueror of the German.
Hail Levius, Germanigan!
Honorable fathers
And Senators of Rome.
Have you heard what is being proposed?
Galius Matheus Levius,
Have asked that we the Roman Senate
Should give
These barbarians,
These savages
Roman citizenship and settle them on Roman lands.
To treat these wondering murderers
As brothers,
Equal.
And what about other provinces?
What of Goule? So loyal to us.
What of Syria,
And Egypt which send us our grain?
If we make Roman of these barbarians,
Can we withhold
Roman citizenship from them?
No! Then what becomes of the precious price
Roman citizenship once was
It becomes a cheap, common thing.
It will be given away like bread.
I say no!
Warriors!
Let us rid our minds of these poisonous idea.
Crucify their leader.
Send the rest as slave
Teach them once and for all what it is to make war on Rome.
That...
Is the Roman way.
Honorable fathers of Rome!
You have greeted me as a soldier,
Who came in small triumph from the wars.
And I thank you for it.
But you will have a hard decision to make here today!
And it must not be I as a soldier
Swayed your vote.
I ask, therefore, of Caesar
That a man who's neither soldier nor senator,
But a philosopher.
A man of reason
Be permitted to speak for me.
Fellow Romans!
Greek! Greek!
Roman Greek have become a Roman by choice.
Slave! Slave!
I'm not a slave.
I want my freedom.
Fellow Romans.
I am a teacher,
And as a teacher I know that when I
Tried to teach the same lessons for a hundred times
And still the pupil does not understand
Then I force to conclusion that
Perhaps there's something wrong,
Other with the lesson
Or the teacher.
A hundred times we have taught
Those we have called barbarians
What it means to make war with Rome,
We burned their villages,
We crucified their leaders.
We've enslaved their young.
As far as go out to death and buried.
The slaves die, slowly.
But their hatred that we leave behind us
Never dies!
Hatred means wars.
Wars mean tribute
From our provinces,
Taxes,
Hunger,
Disease.
How costly that is!
How wasteful!
And yet the answer is simple.
We must have no war.
No war?
When your friends continually attack us.
This is treason!
These people have proved their aims
Very clearly.
To destroy us
And to destroy the whole Roman way of life.
And yet...
The answer is simple.
Let us transform my friends from men of war
To men of peace.
Let us put them on our abandoned farmland.
Not only will they produce food for themselves,
But this I pledge you.
One day they will send food to Rome.
Yes, I agree!
Put them on those lands.
Let them produce for us
But as slaves.
That is the way it has always been?
Neither here, we have twenty thousands
Of slaves in the family states.
Where are they now?
All sold or freed.
Why?
Because neither oppose to slavery.
No, because it is no longer profitable to keep slaves.
Slaves do not produce as much as free men.
Let us do what is profitable.
And right.
Let us share the greatest gift of all.
Let us give these men the right of Rome and freedom.
And they will spread the word
That Rome has accepted them as equal, then
We will have our human frontiers.
The Roman peace
That Marcus Aurelius promised.
In the name of Caesar...
In the name of Caesar!
Caesar has asked me
When has Rome ever been greater or stronger?
I say in answer to Caesar,
Never has Rome been greater or stronger than mow.
And what is it that has kept our empire together?
Our strength!
Our might!
Equality...
Freedom...
Peace.
Who is it that uses these words but Greeks,
And Jews and slaves.
Behind him and his people are the bandits...
Untold millions of them.
Waiting for a moment of weakness ready to destroy us.
If we take these barbarians and be amongst us,
Our enemies will say is it because
We are weak.
Then they will pour in to us from everywhere.
It will be the end of the Roman empire.
It will be the end of Rome.
End of Rome? The end of Rome?
How should an empire die?
Does it collapse in one terrible moment?
No. No!
But there comes a time when its people no longer believe in it.
Then, then! That an empire begins to die
Fathers of Rome,
I have lived under four great emperors
Trageon,
Henum,
Antonitus
Marcus Aurelius
When during all those years our empire grew.
Changed.
There all life is grow or die.
And you, the senators,
Are the heart of Rome.
It is through you that the people speak.
Speak up! Let the world hear you!
Let the world know
That Rome will not die.
There are millions like them waiting at our gates.
If we do not open these gates they will break them down
And destroy us, but instead,
Let us grow ever bigger,
Ever greater.
Let us take them among us.
Let the heart of the empire grow with us
Honorable fathers.
We have changed the world.
Can we not change ourselves?
Yes!
It is time to change! An end of war.
End to war!
Levius.
Oh Levius.
You have won.
We have won.
We have won the Senate.
We have yet to win Rome.
Rome is with you.
The armies are with you.
I'll be with you.
March against Comadeus.
With you as Caesar all Rome will change
You think you have defeated me,
Haven't you?
Since it was for Rome it cannot be your defeat.
It is also very clear now,
Why you came.
To destroy me.
I could kill you, both!
As for the Senate...
If you will try to oppose the will of the Senate...
I will not oppose the will of the Senate.
We'll allow your barbarians to settle,
But you,
You are no longer second in command to Caesar.
You will return to your northern frontiers,
And you will patrol them forever.
Until it is my pleasure to change my mind.
No, no, no, sister.
I'm not giving you anymore chances to prop against me.
You will go back to your husband in Armenia,
And you will not see Rome or Levius again.
A few days ago,
You were ready to make peace with Rome.
Over these half years we have made many peace treaty.
But many have died.
Of the northern people only you were left.
If you are afraid of the hordes of bandits on your frontier,
Rome will protect you.
Why did you refuse?
Why? Speak out clearly,
Now!
Or be on your way.
All these years in this wilderness.
What have we accomplished?
The first time in the history of the Roman empire
Boast of the northern peace.
And that could be a long, months, years.
For that moment has come.
That one moment that is too much
Would that moment would come
If Lucila were here with you?
A command from Caesar.
Your ought to return to Rome.
Themonitus,
Look! It's Levius!
All is well without you.
We prosper.
They have a home, like the Roman.
As you can see there's more than enough for ourselves.
You were right, Levius.
There's no limit what could be done
With the human spirit, for good or evil.
Have you heard from Lucila?
No.
I haven't heard a word, not for months.
I hear there's a famine I Rome.
People are dying in thousands of hunger
And pestilence.
I must get there before night fall.
I'm glad you prosper.
Terrible day, isn't it Levius?
I'm afraid the gods are angry.
They are torturing Rome with this
Pestilence
Thousands have died. I am alone.
I have no one to...
To turn to,
Except you.
I have not wanted to be away.
The entire East of Babel,
Arabia,
Judea, Cappadocia, Syria,
Egypt... Syria and Egypt!
That is Marcelus' and Versilana's...
They were among the most loyal.
Yes, to my father.
The army is against me,
Against Rome.
Even Sir Hamas has joined them.
He has forced Lucila to flea with him Levius.
Where is the Eastern army, Comadeus?
They have sided with the rebels.
There's only the northern army left to crash them.
And you,
You're the only one they will follow.
Levius.
Take command.
Do not give me this power, Comadeus.
The gods are all with me.
They will always be with me.
Go to the East and crash this rebellion.
Do not give me this power.
I'm not afraid.
You asked for this meeting!
Speak!
You are prepared to do battle with us,
Even before you have spoken to us.
You have rebelled against Rome.
Marcus Aurelius spoke of an empire
Of equal nations.
Rome will not tolerate rebellion!
We're old friend, Levius.
You are traitors!
You have caused two armies to mutiny!
You have threatened the empire!
We are not alone in this, Levius.
Levius.
Levius. Oh Levius.
The gods were kind to us.
They sent you. You. You.
You're a part of this, Lucila?
I am a great part of this.
Why a rebellion?
We are breaking away from Rome.
We will make our own empire with these
An Eastern empire.
An Eastern empire! You will make chaos!
What will hold you together?
What will you do to divide the empire?
But not if you'll join us, Levius.
We will have all Rome greater than ever.
What have you done, Lucila?
I am trying to prevent a disaster
My brother has set upon.
They may be wrong of what Comadeus has done,
But this is not the way to oppose him.
I cannot let you destroy the empire!
Cannot!
Cannot!
If you cannot then take your army back to Rome.
Let us make our own destiny here.
And let the rebellion go on unpunished!
I am part of this rebellion!
I am beginning to wonder if you ever love me.
It is out of love that I dared so much.
Run, Lucila.
Hide somewhere now before it is too late
Because as certain as death,
We'll fall upon the rebellious army and crash them
I do not run, Levius.
INGMAR BERGMAN MAKES A MOVIE
FILMING - PART 1
Can we start?
Blow the horn, will you?
You'll be on the outside.
- This is where I enter?
You'll start here, Gunnar.
I know.
So, you'll say your first line,
"I'm expecting a visitor.
I'm expecting a visitor any minute."
Try it once.
I'm expecting a visitor any minute.
Ingrid enters.
You leave the door as it is.
You come forward, Gunnar.
- Shall I close it a bit?
- Yes, close it a bit.
Ingrid takes out her handkerchief.
- How far should I go?
You stand next to her.
You hold your handkerchief and blow your nose.
- I haven't got a handkerchief.
- Use your mitten.
You move forward, Gunnar.
You don't approve of her blowing her nose like that.
You stop here and look out.
This is how work begins
on every little scene in a movie,
with the director showing the actors
how he wants them to move about.
This work is called "blocking."
Sometimes there'll be long discussions
about a short walk.
It can make an actor feel uncomfortable,
as if wearing an ill-fitting garment.
Isn't there one that would fit better?
The director is testing and cajoling.
It may seem like nonsense,
but it isn't.
When the director demonstrates
what movements he has
in mind for the actors,
it's a feeling he has.
Here you discover whether
the director and the actors
feel the same about the role
and are on the same wavelength.
God's silence?
Yes, God's silence.
This is where you have your coughing attack.
It's pretty prolonged.
Yes, like that.
Jonas Persson and his wife were here, and I could only spout drivel.
Yet I had the feeling that each word was decisive somehow.
What am I to do?
As you raise your hands.
Would you stop your hammering?
I say: "Poor little Tomas.
You should be in bed with a brandy.
You're running quite a temperature."
Right, God's silence.
She doesn't give a damn.
She only recognizes that he needs to be taken care of.
So you cross over to this side, right?
Poor little Tomas.
You should be in bed with a brandy-
I need to caress him.
- Right.
And you discover he's really ill this time.
He's always whining.
- You're running quite a temperature.
- Yes, like that.
Why did you take Communion?
Directors use
different methods ofblocking.
Bergman is striving to block
as simply as possible.
Nothing artificial.
He wants clarity, order
and the big picture.
He can get furious at
a showy, pretentious arrangement.
The faces and the dialogue
are to tell the whole story.
Looking closer at this scene,
one will see small, simple movements
of one human being
searching for another.
A strong individual
searching for a weaker one,
who shrinks back
from the stronger one's help.
A woman searching for a man
who turns his back on her.
You saw this deletion:
"I was writing my sermon, a short letter..."
I got it yesterday.
- You saw the deletion?
- Yes.
- Let's go back to the earlier one.
- Keeping the deletion in mind.
Do they have to hammer right now?
They gave us a "clear" signal.
Could they be quiet for a while?
Is someone hanging in the air above us with a hammer?
Where were we?
"Over there."
When rehearsing,
the actors don't act it out fully.
They only mark their lines,
just deliver them straight.
- When did it arrive?
- Yesterday. It's on my desk.
Read it later-
She gets very annoyed:
"Read it later, when you feel like it, or you find the time for it."
When you feel like it.
Read it later, when you feel like it.
You get very tired.
- How tired?
- What's his line?
Nothing is said until Märta says -
Right.
That's when you start yawning.
A horrible, feverish yawn.
It makes you shiver all over.
Then you put your head down.
It's going to sound like I'm mumbling.
Stickan, can you come in with the microphone?
- Maybe.
- Just watch the shadow.
I'll try not to talk up my sleeve.
Quiet, now!
Guys, a little quiet, okay?
You look out through the window.
The snow, the silence, the boredom.
Can he close his eyes?
Be on his own for a while?
Go ahead. Action.
Another Sunday in the vale of tears.
I don't feel very well.
- Want me to feel sorry for you?
- Yes, please.
Then you'll have to marry me.
Right. It's very low.
You can't get up?
Can you slide down a little?
So she doesn't have to hang in the air.
Start from "another Sunday."
Another Sunday in the vale of tears.
I don't feel very well.
- Want me to feel sorry for you?
- Yes, please.
- Then you'll have to marry me.
- Oh?
You should marry me.
You know, a real woman's line.
She takes advantage of the situation.
You should marry me.
Why?
Then I wouldn't have to leave this place.
Why would you have to leave?
We won't discuss this too much, but I thought he might say,
"Why would you have to leave?"
He can think of many things, but that this strong woman, with all her powers over him and the earth and sky, would move away- that he cannot fathom.
You want him to be a little mean.
A sort of calm meanness.
But until that point, stick to a pleasant tone?
Why would you have to leave?
- What?
- "As long as I'm a substitute..."
As long as I'm a substitute,
I can be transferred.
Far away from you.
We'll see what happens.
And that pisses you both off.
She gets up and says -
Yes, I know,
You can't marry me.
That's as far as we'll take it.
This is the first rehearsal.
The blocking rehearsal.
It continues,
rehearsal after rehearsal,
scene after scene.
This is the fourth rehearsal.
Start.
I'm expecting a visitor any minute.
Don't worry.
I won't stay long.
It's getting pretty cold out.
Do you want me to go straight on?
Right.
Let's not forget to brace up this damned window.
The whole church wall is falling apart.
I can feel it as I lean against it.
"Poor little Tomas."
Poor little Tomas.
You should be in bed with a brandy.
You're running quite a temperature.
Why did you take Communion?
It's a love feast, isn't it?
May I see for a minute?
Try going in a little closer.
All right. That's good. Stop.
Go on. Quiet.
Don't forget the pause.
Another Sunday in the vale of tears.
I don't feel very well.
- Want me to feel sorry for you?
- Yes, please.
Then you'll have to marry me.
Oh?
You should marry me.
Why?
Then I wouldn't have to leave this place.
Why would you have to leave?
As long as I'm a substitute,
I can be transferred.
Far away from you.
Ingrid, try not to shade him.
You're stealing his light.
You see, you're shading him.
There. Is that okay?
As long as I'm a substitute,
I can be transferred.
Far away from you.
We'll see what happens.
That's his perennial response whenever she suggests it.
He always says,
"Let's talk about it later."
"Let's see." Something like that.
"We'll have to discuss it."
He's permanently too tired to decide.
As if he'd decided never to decide.
He doesn't even listen.
He just hears this is going to be tiresome.
This is where we stopped.
No, wait.
We'll do the upward motion also.
Take that last part again.
We'll see what happens.
- Do you want me to finish?
- Yes, please.
Yes, I know.
You can't marry me.
Stickan!
Can you hear anything at all?
It's a little boxy, isn't it?
Let's remove this piece here.
Please remove that bit of ceiling over there.
Right. That's better.
That was rehearsal number four.
The next time we use the TVcamera
is for rehearsal seven of this scene.
Now everything's taking shape,
but there's still some confusion.
This is the rhythm of a studio.
Everything slowly leads up
to the first shot.
Some directors like a high level
of constant concentration.
But Bergman strives to have the actors
relax, with laughter and chatter.
There's nothing more disgusting when you're playing a big part than leaving the stage for a short while.
You think it's like a rest.
Like hell it is!
It's like being put out in the cold.
The trick is not to leave the stage for a second.
It's like leaving your motor running.
It can run forever.
It's this whole thing about taking a break, you see.
In her case it's a little different.
She rehearses five hours a day.
That's a little different.
It's a constant for her.
She knows what to rehearse for.
Like a tightrope walker, or-
It's awful.
The other thing about actors is that new actors on a set will arrive rather tense in the morning.
And then they spend the whole day feeling tense.
And embarrassed around those who are already familiar with the set.
Especially if they're inexperienced.
They're scared stiff.
Stiff-necked and tense all day long, they get so tired they don't even know their names anymore.
It's kind of scary.
I'm very dependent on the room.
If I get moved around within the same set,
I feel like it's the first day of shooting again.
That's what filming is about - changing the room, right?
A room can be "worn in."
Like this church.
It's familiar now.
Ingrid is funny.
She starts by walking around for a long time, like a cat.
Then she finds her spot, and that's where she lies down.
That's where she stays.
If you move her, she gets unhappy.
Like a coyote that tramples down the weeds and then settles in.
Let's have a look at it.
We'll start over there.
Silence.
Have those been on your knuckles all along?
Didn't you notice?
So many?
- I'll take some off.
- What are they for?
They're supposed to be sores from the frost.
It says I've got sores.
That's what you wrote.
It says "a frozen cheek" in the script.
Does this belong here?
- No, over there.
Where is that, then?
The glasses - are they gone?
- They're behind the basket.
- Where's the basket?
- She brings it in.
Stand by. Quiet!
Could you take a look?
Let's start a little further back.
There. Stop.
What lens are you using?
- A 75.
Quiet!
Action!
I'm expecting a visitor any minute.
Don't worry.
I won't stay long.
It's getting pretty cold out.
Maybe a little too much.
Look over at him. That's right.
- Poor little -
- Hold the pause after you reach him.
Understand?
Stand there for a moment.
Poor little Tomas.
What is it, Tomas?
- It wouldn't matter to you.
- Tell me anyway.
You have a pause in there.
He's squirming about as he's talking to her, not only because ofJonas Persson, but because it's hard to talk to her about religious matters.
You mean "God's silence?"
Well, the religious issues, since she doesn't care about them.
Isn't there a void between them?
He seems afraid of her irony, maybe.
There's more of that in this scene than the issue with Jonas Persson.
The atmosphere is so charged already that everything has come to a halt.
Even before they start talking, they start with a recrimination or an insult, like when he says,
"It wouldn't matter to you."
Even before he said anything about "God's silence."
They are two terribly sensitive people who constantly cause each other pain.
When he asks,
"Why did you take Communion?"
Is her answer ironic?
Is she referring to the letter and the love feast?
Couldn't that be irony too?
- I think so.
How do you mean?
It's supposed to be a love feast - the only way to get love from him.
Well, she takes Communion -
Remember that the letter precedes this.
She wrote from her heart about prayers being answered.
There is a deeply religious experience in this, a genuine feeling when she takes Communion.
Like, "He'll have read the letter.
He'll see that I'm taking Communion."
Right?
Though her taking Communion doesn't affect him in any way.
- But the letter-
- She doesn't know that yet.
Right, she doesn't know that yet.
She notices a certain numbness in his reactions.
- I still think about the irony-
- Absolutely.
There's numbness in his every move.
That's where the irony is.
They're little things, but it's good to know the flow of thoughts.
- We haven't even talked about the rash.
- We will.
Shall we continue?
Quiet!
Let's start from the dialogue.
From "What is it?"
- What is it, Tomas?
- It wouldn't matter to you.
Tell me anyway.
God's silence.
God's silence?
God's silence.
Jonas Persson and his wife were here... and I could only spout drivel.
Yet I had the feeling that each word was decisive somehow.
What am I to do?
Poor little Tomas.
You should be in bed with a brandy.
You're running quite a temperature.
Why did you take Communion?
- It's a love feast, isn't it?
- Just like that.
Did you read my letter?
I should hold my hand here.
Right. Once again.
Gunnar, you need to slide down a bit.
Slouch a bit.
Poor little Tomas.
You should be in bed with a brandy.
You're running quite a temperature.
Why did you take Communion?
It's a love feast, isn't it?
Did you read my letter?
No. I haven't had the time.
You're hopeless.
When did it arrive?
- Yesterday.
Linger on the pause.
Use just the pause, not your tone of voice, so we can feel her disappointment.
You're running quite a temperature.
Why did you take Communion?
It's a love feast, isn't it?
Did you read my letter?
No. I haven't had the time.
You're hopeless.
When did it arrive?
- Yesterday. It's on my desk-
Read it later, when you feel like it.
Stay there.
How much do you need?
- A little bit more. There. Good.
Ingrid, when you get too far down,
I can feel that you're shading me.
I don't dare go in any closer.
When she's standing like that, we may need to back up some more.
The ideal actor is someone
who can turn on full concentration
in a split second.
And who can then, after each take,
right after you say "cut,"
turn it off,
like switching off a light.
It's so incredibly important.
The moment a tough scene is finished,
the more complicated
the scene has been,
and the more serious they have been,
the more we fool around.
It's important to get some rest
and relaxation
between each shot.
But then,
when I say "Camera.! Action.!"
Full concentration
will be there again.
The rehearsed material
should be so ingrained
that the heightened concentration
provides a boost.
After all the preparation, it's time
to shoot the scene for the first time.
The atmosphere takes on a special feeling.
Everybody is concentrating.
Katinka Faragó, the script girl,
with a huge script book in her arms,
places objects on the desk
in the sacristy
so they will match previous takes.
Makeup artist Gullan Westfelt
adjusts makeup and hair.
Kalle and Sven
are chasing microphone shadows.
Gaffer Gerhard Karlsson, that is,
and photographer Sven Nykvist.
They check for troublesome shadows
from the microphone rods
that soundman Brian Wikström
places over the actors'heads.
Shadows may be permitted in TV,
but never in a motion picture.
The director himself is like
a hen on her eggs, shifting restlessly.
Quiet, everyone!
Quiet, everyone!
Action!
- What about the first line?
- We'll fix that later.
Just go ahead with it.
Is the clock okay over there?
- Yes.
It's in there, right?
Quiet!
- How were my mittens?
Left one off, right one comes off as you enter.
Quiet.
What's that buzzing?
- The lamps, right?
It's the AIC.
Is it audible, Stickan?
- Yes, of course.
- It's the ceiling lights.
- Then turn them off!
That's better.
Quiet, everyone!
Quiet!
Camera!
146 to 171 - take one.
Action!
I'm expecting a visitor any minute.
Don't worry.
I won't stay long.
It's getting pretty cold out.
Poor Tomas.
What is it, Tomas?
- It wouldn't matter to you.
Tell me anyway.
God's silence.
God's silence?
THIS WAS TAKE ONE.
THE SCENE WAS FILMED 11 TIMES.
[music] (drumming)
[music] (band: "Yellow Rose of Texas")
Taxes, taxes.
I used to pay $300.
You know what I pay now?
1,408 bucks.
Over $100 a month,
I gotta pay Uncle Sam first.
- MAN: Too high.
- Too high. Well, the school...
Here he is now.
What do you think of him?
Mr. Humphrey,
I hope you get good luck.
- Thank you so much, my friend.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Thank you very, very much.
- Sure.
- You're very fine.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
You betcha.
I'll be listening in tomorrow night.
If you ever get in,
I will see you, by God.
Say, you come on down to the White House and have a cup of coffee. Okay?
Maybe a Schnapps.
Yeah. Good.
Yeah.

MAN (narrating):
The big handshake, the big rally,
the wild race across the landscape searching out voters...
all repeated endlessly for days and weeks and months.
These are the ordeal and the exhilaration of the US presidential candidate.
In the entire campaign,
nothing is wilder than the battle of an important state primary
fought in every town and precinct,
with the prospect that the candidate might be knocked out of the nomination
if he loses.
But even if he wins, his victory might count for nothing at the convention.
Now, traveling along with them,
hot on the heels of two fast-moving presidential hopefuls,
you are about to see a candidates view of this frantic process
and an intimate view of the candidates themselves
in their cars and buses,
behind the scenes, in TV studios and hotel rooms...
excited, exhausted
and tensely awaiting the verdict of the voters.
The names could be
Taft, Wilkie, Kefauver,
the time, any election year,
the place, any of several key states.
This happens to be 1960.
Senator John Kennedy, millionaire,
Catholic,
Easterner from Massachusetts,
is challenging a Midwesterner,
Huben' Humphrey,
senator from Minnesota,
in his own backyard, the state of Wisconsin.
FRANK SINATRA (on radio):
[music] They're voting for Jack [music]

[music] Oops, there goes the opposition, ker... [music]
I give you Senator Kennedy.
Uh-
If we can hold the darts till the speaker is retired...
Campaigning is hazardous enough.
But, uh, we want to express our appreciation to all of you for coming here today.
I think it is a fair question as to why I should campaign, really, in a sense, since last summer and most intensively since the first of January in only one of 50 states.
I think the reason for that is a quite simple one.
This is one of the few states in the United States which permits the people themselves in primaries to participate in the election of presidential candidates.

[music] He's got high ...' [music]
Kennedy headquarters.
Racine's ready with your call.
Go ahead.
There was a letter pledging themselves as one of the Democratic candidates to, uh, observe any moratorium on small arms... small nuclear arms testing that the president might agree to.
Thank you.
How do you do?
Thank you very much.
How are you?
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks a lot.
Thanks. Looking good.
- I don't know.
- I mean next time.
Next time.
- Mr. Kennedy.
- Thanks a lot. Thanks for coming today.
- Here's the next president.
- Well, I'll be... We're working hard.
Thank you very much.
How are you?
- I wish you good luck.
- Thank you very much indeed.
WOMAN: I, uh, had your sister Eunice at my house.
Oh, listen. Thank you very much.
I'm glad to see you.
Listen, you were awfully nice to her.
WOMAN:
I enjoyed it.
It's nice to know.
She's coming back today.
- I can't get over how you two look alike.
- I know.
Well, good to see you.
Thanks. I'll tell her I saw you.
- Oh, you do that.
- Right.
Thank you very much.
- KENNEDY: I got your vote?
- Yup.
GIRL:
I'm thrilled I got to meet you. Yeah!
Thank you. This was a big thrill for my kids at school.
[music] (accordions:
"The Ballad of Davy Crockett")
HUMPHREY:
I appreciate what you folks do.
[music] (man singing)
CROWD:
[music] Hubert, Hubert Humphrey [music]
[music] The president for you and me [music]
[music] (singing continues, faint)
Mr. Mayor, representatives and my friends,
I have really just finished the very last bite of that wonderful ham, mashed potatoes and string beans, and I was just beginning to enjoy it.
Well, we have a surprise for you this afternoon.
Uh, we are very fortunate this afternoon to have in our studios right now
Senator Hubert Humphrey from Minnesota.
- How are you, Senator?
- I'm just fine.
And I've had a wonderful reception downtown on the streets of Tomah.
It has been one of the most enthusiastic and pleasant I've had.
Well, that's very fine. How long do you intend being in our fair city?
Well, Tom, I am not going to be here nearly long enough.
And, uh, my good friend
Senator Eugene McCarthy,
I understand, is really plugging for you too.
The senator's wife Abigail and my wife were raised in the same town.
Wabasha, Minnesota.
You probably know where that is.
I think both you and Gene McCarthy out-married yourselves, I'm sure.
- Yeah.
- I know that Abigail is a wonderful woman.
Well, Senator, now that you're here, and of course our community in this area is strictly farm community...
(man on radio, indistinct)
So, any farm implements you want,
stop into the Mack Implement Company of Camp Douglas,
your Oliver tractor and Gale implement dealers in this area.
They're waiting to serve you.
Well, I'll be very frank with you... the question has been asked of me if I think that Senator Kennedy will, uh, be out of the election.
In other words, will not win the election.
To be very frank with you, gentlemen, the impression that I gather in and around this area, the answer is yes.
I don't believe that he can win in the primary in Wisconsin.
Senator Hubert Humphrey will be defeated in the primary election in the state of Wisconsin
and the senator John Kennedy of Massachusetts
will win the primary in our state.
I'm Senator Humphrey.
Pleased to meet you.
Let me give you my card.
Nice to see you.
I'm Senator Humphrey.
- Just stopping by to say hello.
- Hello.
You betcha.
Okay. And how are you today?
I'm Senator Humphrey.
This your boy here?
How do you do? Hello, son.
Good boy. What do you got, a lot of money there?
Say, that's just what I need for my campaign.
Can I have that?
I'm running short.
This is really...
It's just play money.
Oh, it's just play money?
Well, that'll maybe work.
Here, I'll give you one of these.
You bet. Nice to see you.
I hope you'll be at the election booth tomorrow, April 5.
And my name is Humphrey.
- What's your name?
- Blair. Bill Blair.
- And this is Mrs. Blair.
- Very good. Thank you.
If you have as good a judgment in politics as you have for your wife,
I'll get your vote.
- You'll get it.
- Bye.
- Thank you.
- Hello, young man. How are you?
- What's your name?
- Bryan.
Glad to meet you.
Well, I'm glad to meet you.
It's a pleasure.
Good to see you again.
Yeah.
- (no audible dialogue)
- (woman laughing)
Lucky man.
How are you? How do you do?
- And how are you, princess?
- Fine.
Take this home and show it to your mama.
Tell her hello from Senator Humphrey.
Tell her to vote for me April 5.
Hello there.
How are you, young lady?
- How are you?
- Fine.
- Are you working for Humphrey?
- No. I mean, yes, I am.
- But I'm not voting.
- But you're going to work for me?
- Yes. Work hard.
- You're going to talk to the folks about me?
- Yes.
- Okay. And your neighbors?
- Yes.
- Okay. Fine. Good.
If I can just have you girls working for me, we'll win hands-down.
That's right.
Now, I want you to do that.
Tell the folks, tell Daddy and Mama to vote for Senator Humphrey.
How are you? Here you are.
You take that home to your folks.
That's right.
How do you do, sir? How are you?
Let me give you one of my cards.
Tell the folks hello for me, will you?
My name is Humphrey.
MAN: Would you like to talk to a reporter, Senator?
I talk to the people that vote.
REPORTER:
What about this Symington thing?
What about this?
Well, I would honestly read it.
Seriously, a guy named Robert Groener, he's head of the Symington Committee.
He got on the box today down there, and they had a big panel show.
He announced they're coming all out for Hubert Humphrey.
- Very fine.
- But you didn't know about this?
No, sirree.
Sir, now, if I can get the Kennedy committee for me, we can make it unanimous.
Talk to them in there.
CHILD:
He's going to vote for him.
HUMPHREY: That's wonderful.
Hello there. How do you do, sir?
Glad to see you.
Let me give you one of my cards, sir.
Thank you.
Hello. How do you do?
Nice to see you.
I'm Senator Humphrey.
All right, all set.
Let's go. Yeah.
Wrap the fingers around just a touch,
Senator, just easy-like.
Kind of intertwine the fingers a little.
There. That's it. Fine there.
That's it. Easy there.
So few of my clients are Democrats, but I like to kind of get a look in on.
It's not time to smile yet.
You do it all by yourself.
A quarter of an inch.
About a quarter of an inch of cuff, so...
There. That's it.
Eyes just above the camera.
That's it. Fine.
Now, just one more.
Then you're all free.
Could you swing your body a little bit more to the camera there?
No different from the rest of our states, you know, in Minnesota.
WOMAN:
Right.
One of the most beautiful parts of Wisconsin.
WOMAN:
It's very, very beautiful.
The rolling, uh, terrain.
Wooded, yet nice fields.
Yeah.
MAN:
It makes you sleepy.
HUMPHREY: Yeah. Then speaking right afterwards is, uh...
Nudge me.
I know better than that.
WOMAN: Just put your head back and take a little nap until you get to Mindoro.
Yes. How far is Mindoro?
Well, it'll take half an hour to get over there.
MAN (on radio): Now the news...
A political bombshell has been set off
in Wisconsin.
The Symington for President Committee threw its weight
behind Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey.
This brought a strong reaction from the Kennedy camp.
The Missouri senator, however, is said to have had nothing to do
with the action of his committee.
WOMAN:
Thank you.
Thank you very much for coming today.
CHILD:
May I shake your hand?
May I shake your hand, please?
- Thank you!
- We can go this way.
- CHILD: Thank you!
- Now, anybody I didn't get?
- I guess we're late.
- Mine!
- Whose is this?
- Mine!
If you would write me at the Senate,
I'll send you a picture and autograph and something about the Capitol.
Just write me... Senator Kennedy, the Senate, Washington, DC.
Then we'll send you all some stuff.
Two weeks, this will be the end...
It'll be green though.
Because the snow brings with it a great amount of nitrogen for the soil.
WOMAN:
That's right.
And that fertilizes it.
WOMAN: Believe it or not,
North Dakota and... where our farm is,
210 miles further north of it...
I have much more identification with the vigilant Congress than my friend Jack does.
He's never...
Jack's identification in Congress has been with one group... labor.
Labor legislation.
My identification has been with the UN, disarmament, foreign policy, not just most recently, but since I've been there with, uh... with broad areas of social welfare legislation.
But I agree that you don't project this necessarily.
NARRATOR: This is the heart of Senator Humphrey's strength...
the farm areas of Wisconsin, close to the border of Minnesota.
And though he likes to discuss everything from foreign policy to disarmament,
here there is only one issue to test the skill of an orator.
MAN: Senator,
I am the president of the village.
- How do you do?
- Certainly happy to have you in town.
Say, I'm glad to see you, Mr. Gilbert.
Thank you so much.
- Here's Mr. Peazer.
- How do you do, sir?
Glad to see you, Mr. Peazer.
- MAN: What is your name?
- Gunderson.
Gunderson. Gunderson.
How do you do?
Good to see you there.
Yes, sir. Nice to see you.
- What is your name? Mr. Michaelson.
- How do you do, Mr. Michaelson?
And yours, sir?
Oh, yeah? (Stammering)
All I know is... (Norwegian phrase)
You got a lot of Norwegians around here.
Pretty good.
That's good.
How many Swedes?
- You heard of them too?
- (laughing)
I, uh, still have my cup of coffee here.
After all, I met a couple of Norwegians over here, you see, and since I'm only half Norwegian, they only give me a half a cup.
I wanted to finish it off.
Anyway, when you're out speaking, as I have been, why, once in a while a good cup of coffee sort of braces you up for the next meeting.
Now, gentlemen,
I am one of the candidates in your
Wisconsin presidential primary race.
We're going to have an election here
Tuesday, April 5, and this election is, of course, a very important one in terms of your state.
Now, my friends, during my service in the United States Senate for 12 years,
I have given more time, more attention to matters of agriculture than any other one subject.
Now, Senator Humphrey is not out here just to please you by these comments.
I say that Wisconsin has lost hundreds of millions of dollars of sales.
I say that the businessmen of Wisconsin have lost hundreds of millions of dollars worth of business because of reduced foreign income, and I charge here that not a single candidate in this primary election has paid any attention to the farmer at all except Hubert Humphrey, and I make that statement without any boast or any claim.
Instead of you reading about who you ought to have as president in Life magazine, you oughta take a good look at him in the flesh.
You oughta hear what they've got to say.
Because let me tell you something,
Life, Time, Fortune, Look and Newsweek don't give a hoot about your dairy prices.
And I know they laugh at you.
I've been down at their editorial boards... some of them... and I'll tell you, they have no more appreciation of a farmer's problem than they have of what's going on on the other side of the moon.
Frankly, they don't know the difference between a corncob and a ukulele.
I can tell you that my votes aren't very popular sometimes in New York City or Boston because back there, what they want...
when I read the editorials,
The Wall Street Journal,
Boston Globe, The New York Times... they want a price support program that's lower.
They say that the farmer is being subsidized, and they look at Hubert Humphrey's record and they say,
"Well, this fellow, this Humphrey, he's just from the Midwest."
"He's just for those farmers."
That's what they say.
They're right.
I am.
But I am not, if you please, for a farm program that will destroy agriculture.
I think Benson's farm program is insane, and I'll guarantee you one thing... if I get to be president of the United States,
I'm going to buy that man a ticket personally and send him right back to Utah, where he ought to have been all the time.
Now, thank you very much for letting me speak to you.
You've been a fine and a good audience.
Good luck. Safe journey home.
We're going on to La Crosse.
By the way, tune in tonight at 7:30.
We're gonna have another one of those television shows.
And if you got a question you want to ask, just pick up the phone and call me collect.
Just pick it up and say,
"I want to talk to that fellow Humphrey at the TV station at La Crosse," and put that call through and ask me on the air, and you can make it tough, make it real tough.
'Cause people like it better that way.
They like to see me squirm.
- (laughter)
- You make it real tough, and I'll try to give you a good answer.
Thanks very, very much.
Yes, sir. Good to be with you.
I'm going right back out there.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- ...coat, and we'll get, uh...
- Well.
That reminds me, I gotta get my coat out of the bag over there too.
I was gonna put on the wrong coat.
Tell you what you have to do tonight is to be sure to remind these people to call person-to-person.
- Person-to-person?
- Rather than collect station-to-station.
'Cause we just get all these extra calls.
- Isn't that the idea, Norm?
- All right.
So that we... Yeah.
Well, I gave Norm, uh...
I gave Norm, uh...
On this chart, when the... the way this thing works, the lieutenant governor says,
"Senator, there's been quite a lot of talk about the record.
What's this all about?"
Or something.
Then I say something about that I put my campaign on the basis of the public issues and the record, and I've been trying to emphasize some of the differences that exist between the Democratic candidates.
And here, for example, are some of them.
MAN: All right.
Will this be early in the program?
Right in the beginning.
And then you focus in, you phase right in on that.
Then when I say,
"Now we have a call here"...
And at that point when they're saying,
"Now we have a call," you get off that and get back on to me.
The answer must end about one minute.
Now, uh, when it comes down, before you come to me...
CAMERAMAN: All right, thank you.
We're four seconds down.
Uh, five minutes down. Yeah.
HUMPHREY: Just joke about your husband wondering all day long where you have been and so on.
I could say that I've come here to meet you.
On the TV.
Well, but you're on this show now.
Just take about 30 seconds to tell us where you've been.
Then you gotta come right back to me and say,
"Now, Senator,
I want to come on this record,"
'cause we want to get on those questions.
You want Muriel to have 30 seconds to tell where she's been, what's she's been doing.
HUMPHREY:
Yes, sir.
Moment of suspense.
Senator Humphrey.
MAN (on telephone): Sir, you're advocating the family farm...
Well, I don't think the family farm is impractical at all.
In fact, I would say it's highly desirable, both economically and, more so, socially.
The family farm has social and spiritual values to it
that are of immense...
You should realize that you are voting for the most important individual
in the entire free world,
and that the welfare of our country is heavily involved
in his good judgment, his sense, his responsibility,
his confidence, his integrity,
his ability to meet the problems head on.
Though I'm not, certainly, the president... I'm a long way from that...
I am one of the candidates.
There are about six of us.
And I, therefore, felt that it would be helpful
if the president had, at least, my assurance,
and I am sure the other candidates...
What has happened... What will happen here in Wisconsin today
will happen in the other 49 states.
MAN:
Terrific.
On tomorrow, election day, every one of the 3,446 precincts will be covered by a Kennedy worker.
The hardest thing to do in a Kennedy campaign is to properly harness the enthusiasm he generates.
Everyone that meets him seems to like him, and then they all want to help.
[music] For his high hopes [music]
[music] Come on and vote for Kennedy [music]
[music] Vote for Kennedy [music]
[music] Keep America strong [music]
[music] Kennedy, he just keeps rollin' a... [music]
[music] Kennedy, he just keeps rollin' a... [music]
[music] Kennedy, he just keeps rollin' along [music]
MAN:
That was much better.
You know, you gotta put feeling into it.
WOMAN:
...Fire Department to ask all of you not to smoke cigarettes or cigars for the next 20 minutes.
The senator is ready to arrive in, I'd say, a minute and a half or so, and there has been some complaint by the women that one of their dresses has been burned by a man smoking a cigar in back of her.
So if you will just please...
So if you'll please refrain from smoking, we'd appreciate it.
NARRATOR: This is the heart of Senator Kennedy's strength...
the heavily populated city areas,
particularly the Polish Catholic
Fourth District in Milwaukee.
WOMAN:
I can't wash my hand for a year!
WOMAN:
Right up through here. Right down here.
CROWD: [music] Everybody's voting for Jack [music]
[music] 'Cause he's got what all the rest lack [music]

I just wanted to tell you that my sister's married to a Pole,
Stanislaw Radziwill.
His name is Stanislaw Radziwill.
And he taught me one sentence.
MAN:
I give to you Senator Jack Kennedy.
- (no audible dialogue)
- (applauding continues)
Chairman, ladies and gentlemen,
I first of all want to express my appreciation to all of you.
I know you've been standing for quite a few minutes.
I've been standing for three months, so I... I know how tough it is.
I also want to express my appreciation to my old and valued friend,
Clem Zablocki.
He took on the honorary chairmanship... the honorary chairmanship of this campaign all over the state of Wisconsin six months ago.
This campaign really comes to an end tonight.
I don't think there's anybody in the state of Wisconsin who hasn't decided how they're going to vote, and I must say, it is going to be a decisive campaign.
I've said on many occasions that I didn't think it was possible to be nominated if I were unsuccessful here in Wisconsin, and I must say I mean it.
Clem Zablocki and I sponsored a bill together... the Zablocki-Kennedy Bill, as he calls it, the Kennedy-Zablocki Bill, as I sometimes refer to it.
But that bill, which you may not have ever heard about, provides that the Battle Act shall be amended.
And it shall be possible for surplus foods and surplus things that we have in this country to be made available to the people behind the Iron Curtain.
- The people of Poland.
- (applauding)
We would have passed that bill two years ago...
We would have passed that bill two years ago, but it failed by one vote in the Senate when the president withdrew his support on the day the bill was coming up to vote.
That's how important the office of the presidency is.
He shall determine what shall be our policy on Berlin.
He shall determine whether we shall be at war or peace.
This is the key office, and I run for the presidency because, like you,
I have strong ideas about what this country must do.
I have strong ideas about the United States playing a great role in a historic moment when the cause of freedom is endangered all over the world, when the United States stands as the only sentry at the gate, when we can see the campfires of the enemy burning on distant hills.
That's what's at issue today.
That's what we are attempting to determine.
In the coming months and years, all of us, as Americans, are going to be called out of the ranks.
Our courage is going to be tested, and I am confident that we are going to give the same affirmative answer.
That's what I think this election is about.
That's what we're going to begin to do on next Tuesday.
- Thank you.
- (cheering, applauding)
(chanting) We want Kennedy!
We want Kennedy!
We want Kennedy!
We want Kennedy!
MAN:
Now I understand also we will be pleased to have the privilege of seeing Bob Kennedy,
Senator Kennedy's son.
- KENNEDY: Son?
- Brother!
Brother.
Uh, thank you very much.
I'm sorry that my mother couldn't be here tonight.
And I'm sorry that my sister Pat couldn't come, and my sister Eunice, and my sister Jean, my brother-in-law Peter Lawford, or my brother Teddy, or my cousin Joe Gargan.
So you're going to have to settle with me. Thank you very much.
MAN:
Thank you, Bob.
WOMAN: He looked much better last night than he did tonight.
He has lost weight.
And he was on that panel this afternoon.
He was good on that panel.
And the best to you too.
Good to see you.
MAN: Even for you,
I must say no visiting, please.
- WOMAN: Work on his own record.
- MAN: That's right.
If you can't run on your own record, you haven't got any business running.
- That's right.
- KENNEDY: Thank you very much.
Oh, thanks a lot.
My best to you.
- MAN: My pleasure.
- Thank you very much indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Very glad to see you.
Thank you.
- Thanks for coming through that long line.
- WOMAN: I just know you'll win.
WOMAN 2:
I can still feel it!
Thanks for coming. Thanks to you.
KENNEDY:
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
MAN:
It's all right.
MAN 2: We've got a candidate that isn't afraid to take criticism.
- Listen, not only that...
- MAN: Stop this now.
You'll have the senator all worn out.
Please don't crowd the senator, please.
- No visiting. Let's keep moving there.
- KENNEDY: Thank you. Hi.
Very kind. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.
And to you.
- Thank you.
- Good luck, Jack.
NARRATOR:
Election day.
The voices of the campaign begin to turn into votes.
MAN: Senator Humphrey, and that's who I voted for today.
I believe in the man,
I believe he's sincere
on the civil rights program and his progressive... instinct
that I think that he has.
And, uh, I think it would be a great thing for the country if he were president.
NARRATOR:
The factory gate.
A few last handshakes.
KENNEDY:
The primary got very risky.
But my judgment is,
I never could have been nominated
if I hadn't run in the primary, so I'm taking the risk.
But I would say you have to keep coming up sevens.
WOMAN: I feel very... quite strongly on the religious angle of it,
so I... I, uh, probably would not vote for Kennedy
because of the fact that he would have an allegiance
outside of the United States.
There is no difference, either one.
Humphrey or Kennedy.
There is no difference.
We're hoping for Mr. Kennedy to win today.
We're looking forward to a win in Wisconsin, and that'll carry him right on through into November.
This will be the start.
I feel I'm in favor of Kennedy very much.
I think he's a tremendous man.
My husband and I met him the other night down on Wisconsin Avenue, and, uh, I think he can give us what we need.
And being that...
I suppose I shouldn't say this, but being that he is Catholic and we are Catholic also,
I think that has a lot to do with it.
I'm a pretty good judge of people, because I'm a cab driver.
Well, Kennedy, he's more for the upper class.
You could say he's for the East... Eastern class.
Like, I had Mrs. Humphrey in the cab.
The way she put herself to me was real nice.
MAN: I was surprised that the Catholic issue didn't come up earlier than it did.
Uh, Kennedy has stated, uh, very emphatically that he will not be dictated by Rome.
MAN 2: They shouldn't bring religion into politics.
- MAN 3: Very correct. Mm-hmm.
- REPORTER: Do you think they have?
MAN 4: I look at it this way, that if he's a God-fearing man, if you're a Catholic or Protestant or Jew, I'd respect him for it.
And I certainly would rather have a man who is a God-fearing man than one who isn't.
WOMAN: I believe most people that are Republican will... will be voting for Humphrey.
WOMAN 2: I think Humphrey sounded pretty... pretty good.
I really do.
He's been doing his share and fighting for the working people all this time and I think he's going to continue.
WOMAN 3: What's glamorous about him?
He's younger...
I don't think he's good-looking just because his sister is married to a movie star.
- WOMAN 4: I don't think he's good-looking.
- Doesn't make him a glamor puss.
WOMAN 4: I don't see what's good-looking about him.
WOMAN 3: No. He looks like a farmer boy.
He's got a good head of hair on him.
REPORTER (on radio): The Humphrey and Kennedy camps at this hour
are almost identical.
Each side says it will win in six of the 10 districts.
Each side says it will win the popular vote.
And each side says it will stage a victory celebration sometime tonight.
REPORTER (on TV): The first precinct reporting in today's presidential primary
gave Senator Humphrey 103 votes
to only 16 for his opponent,
Senator Kennedy.
And on the Republican side,
Vice President Richard Nixon drew 35.
Fourteen thousand, nine... nine hundred and eighty-seven.
At 9200 PM.
That's a total of 44% of the precincts reporting.
Forty-four?
44% reporting at 9:00 PM.
Charlie, ask 'em one... one question.
Uh, what did Nixon do in the fourth and fifth?
CHARLIE:
In the fourth and fifth, give me Nixon.
I know, but he didn't take him down.
- Hello?
- We're up 3,914.
- Just a minute, Bob.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
CHARLIE:
5,078 in the fifth.
And keep us apprised.
- What?
- Pierre said it's not a correct quote.
No, that isn't a direct quote.
I just said I would find it difficult to be nominated.
If I lost here, I'd find it extremely difficult to be nominated.
I don't care whether they print it or not.
Yeah, it's Jack.
Forty-four for Humphrey, 63...
REPORTER (on TV):
First returns in that Wisconsin primary.
Senator Humphrey is leading Senator Kennedy
by a margin of two to one
and he's outdrawing Vice President Nixon three to two.
These, however, are very early returns.
They include one precinct where
Humphrey was conceded to be strong.
REPORTER (on TV):
Waukesha is in the second district.
Kennedy, of course, is a Roman Catholic,
Humphrey a Congregational/st and Nixon a Quaker.
Some observers think that the election has resolved into a religious struggle.
KENNEDY:
That religious thing.
The primary is what breaks it wide apart.
It makes religion to be of disproportionate importance.
Imagine it being a front-page story when under ordinary conditions it wouldn't even be printed in the paper.
It's endemic.
I see it every...
I see it every week.
After all, listen, when Jack came out here, this place was locked up for Humphrey.
- HUMPHREY: Good. When is Red Skelton on?
- WOMAN: He's on right now!
Well, let's get him.
We like him. That's our favorite.
Oh, here we are!
Billy, what do you know?
[music] (TV: orchestra)
Ah!
- (TM woman speaking, faint)
- (all laughing)
This would be eight of the 10 districts .
.. uh, fourth and fifth are out yet.
Nothing from Milwaukee yet.
And it would show Humphrey leading in the third, the ninth and 10th.
- WOMAN: Thanks a million for calling.
- What about the second?
Yeah?
I suppose what's happened, of course, is that these Republicans are leaving
Nixon and voting for Humphrey.
Is that a...
JACKIE (whispers):
Shit.
Hi, Jerry. How good to see you.
It would be all right if this was
November you're going through this.
You don't like to go through this six times, do you? Five times?
And then November.
The, uh, ninth is gone.
The, uh, third we have a chance in.
The, uh... Well, just a chance.
It really depends on La Crosse.
The 10th we have a chance in.
MAN:
Yes, sir.
KENNEDY: Just a chance.
The seventh is quite close.
HUMPHREY: Listen, don't let these guys get you congratulating too early.
Then afterwards they say,
"He thought he was in, but he wasn't."
I've been through this before.
- They seem so friendly.
- They are.
But their copy desk boys are not always.
They're all right.
When I first ran for mayor,
I was ahead till 6:00 in the morning
- and I... I ended up losing.
- Oh, my God.
REPORTER (on TV): Polls are now saying that
Humphrey, possibly, may carry five districts.
But it's now clear that the chances of a
Kennedy sweep have almost slipped away,
that it could be a long night for newspaper and radio men covering the election,
and that one of the most elaborate and intense campaigns in the state's history
could wind up meaning almost nothing.
- (people chattering)
- Now, get the, uh...
Hi. Hi.
- How are you? Nice to see you.
- (woman, indistinct)
Well, we'll see what happens.
MAN:
Hey, Jack. How you doing?
- (phone rings)
- MAN: Appleton, the 11th ward.
327 for Jack.
Ninety-two for Humphrey.
Thirty-five for Nixon?
- That's the greatest... (laughs)
- (chattering continues)
- Well, I don't know...
- (chattering)
How you can eat is more than I know.
Kennedy at 21,190.
- Well, fuck.
Hubert... 18,571.
The worst we'll get...
The worst we can get tonight is six to four with the popular vote, and that would end up with 20 and a half to 10 and a half, according to the national committee man for Humphrey and the national committee woman for Jack.
So, actually the 20 and a half to 10 and a half would be a two-to-one victory for Jack on delegates.
It'd be a great victory, actually.
The only ones disturbed are the people who've been talking about
Jack taking all camps.
- Which, uh...
- (chattering continues) is impossible for a Massachusetts boy coming in to Wisconsin.
I say we go ahead.
- (chattering continues)
- (phone ringing)
Hello?
Jack's right by my side.
Wait a minute.
Telephone.
- Did you try coming on the other...
- Yeah.
We'll never make CBS unless he really rings it.
NARRATOR:
The trend is becoming clear.
Senator Humphrey's early lead from the rural areas
is being wiped out as the big city vote comes in.
ANCHOR:
Boy, what a thrill it is... what excitement watching these important races tonight.
In a moment of slight commercialism,
I will mention that some other very exciting things are happening right here in our city these days.
MAN: Kennedy first.
The senator will come over here.
Not yet, Senator, not yet.
- Watch from right here?
- Yeah.
FLOOR DIRECTOR:
Stand by.
ANNOUNCER:
...on the Wisconsin primary.
- Senator, good evening.
- Good evening, Sandy.
How does the evening look to you?
Well, as all these election nights are, it's a very interesting evening.
How has the vote, as it's been thus far, shaped up according to your expectations?
Well, I was hopeful we could take six districts.
I think we have a good chance to do that, which would give us...
And I hope then the majority of the popular vote, which will give us, I think, a very good result.
Senator, how do you feel about this exhaustive campaign?
KENNEDY: It's been a long campaign.
Many months.
But if we're successful at running against a very hardworking, formidable opponent... my colleague and friend,
Senator Humphrey...
If I can be successful against him, I'd be delighted, particularly in Wisconsin, which is, of course, in the heart of the Midwest and next to Minnesota.
So we've got a very long, grueling campaign.
REPORTER:
What are your plans after tonight?
KENNEDY:
Well, we, uh, continue on.
The next primary, of course, is Indiana in the first pan of May.
And then I hit West Virginia, Maryland,
Oregon and Nebraska all in the short space of two and a half weeks.
Those things... it makes it good.
MAN:
Don't smile yet.
You wait a little while.
I may smile even more.
- We're going right into the interview.
- Oh, sure. You bet.
MAN:
I wish you'd give me...
Well, my goodness!
The Voice of America. I'm always glad to say something for them.
This has been a great election.
And the people of Wisconsin are to be congratulated on their genuine interest in this election.
HUMPHREY: This is the best voice that America can have, when the people participate in their government and their politics.
MAN:
How are you gonna come out?
HUMPHREY: I say, I've been in politics too long to make any predictions with one-third of the precincts in.
Only reckless people do that, and radicals, and I'm a conservative, prudent man.
You look awfully satisfied right now, Senator.
I'm pleased. I'm pleased.
You see, if you're... if somebody relegates you to what you call a hard bread and cold water diet and you come up with bouillon and biscuits, it seems pretty good.
KENNEDY:
I always said I wanted to win the majority of the popular vote and the majority of the delegates.
[music] (people singing "High Hopes")
NARRATOR: Senator Kennedy is headed for a two-to-one victory.
But this is short of the margin he needs to get his bandwagon rolling.
Neither man has been knocked out,
and in national standing they remain about where they stood before the primary.
[music] He's got high hopes [music]
[music] (people singing)
[music] Kennedy for the president
Kennedy for the president [music]
[music] Kennedy for the president of USA [music]
HUMPHREY:
I feel that we've done well.
I truly feel that we've done as well or maybe better then we had a right to expect.
(crowd cheering, applauding)
You know, just imagine if we'd have won how much noise there'd have been here.
- MAN: We won, we won. We won.
- (crowd laughing)
HUMPHREY: You know, West Virginia is a very interesting and beautiful state.
Just hills and valleys.
You just work the valleys.
- You sort of walk like this.
- MURIEL: We're used to it.

[Man Narrating]
Summer means many different things to different people.
To some, it might mean the thrill of a high-speed catamaran.
Others like to float around and soak up a few stray rays.
Still others like some kind of inland activity.
But for us, it's the sport of surfing!
The thrill and the fun of the sport of surfing.
Some people like to bodysurf.
Others like to ride a short belly board and get a short ride.
Still others like a short bellyboard and a long ride, like George Greenough at Santa Barbara, California.
Most surfers like to ride a regular board... and perform on medium-sized waves.
Most would like to perform as well as Australian
Nat Young here.
Or as well as American surfer
Butch Van Artsdalen.
Some surfers prefer the hairy thrill of a big wave.
You can go right or left, but you can't very well do both at once.
If you do, at least it's something commonly known in the surfing world... as a wipeout.
The only way to avoid a wipeout is to take this wide
"stink bug" stance.
Spread your legs and hang on till your trunks rip right up the back.
No place represents summertime to more people than the Hawaiian Islands.
To surfers, summer in Hawaii means the reefs near waikiki that break so well-- places like this spot, about a third of a mile out over the reef.
It's called Number Three.
Right next to Number Two.
One of the outstanding surfers from Hawaii-- Mr. Paul Strou.
There are many places on the reef that break during the summer.
About 300 yards from Number Three is another spot called Kaisers.
Friendly surfers in Hawaii.
"Hi there, Charlie."
Conditions are ideal. water temperature averaging 75 degrees.
The air temperature--
75 degrees.
One of the most popular summer breaks is just off to one side... of the Ala wai
Yacht Harbor entrance, a spot called Ala Moana.
On a weekend, you see surfboards, boats, every imaginable thing using the harbor entrance.
In fact, the new sport over there is "trolling for surfers."
If you can sort yourself out from the boats, you can get a great ride, like Gene Harris is doing here at Ala Moana.
Another outstanding surfer from Hawaii-- Fred Hemmings.
Fred only stands up on alternate Wednesdays, but when he does, he really wails.
Just across the entrance channel from Ala Moana is another surfing spot, called Garbage Hole.
They built a breakwater that cut the surf off, but in its day... this spot produced some fantastic rides for surfers like Wayne Miyata.
The ultimate thing to do in surfing is to be actually covered up by the wave.
And here goes Wayne doing the ultimate thing.
This is summertime in Hawaii.
California has a lot of places that represent summer to a lot of people, no place more than this "secret spot"--
Malibu Beach, California, famous for its Malibu
Outriggers, surfing and girls.
This a girl, and for those of you who are maladjusted, this is a Malibu Outrigger.
A lot of good surfers ride in Malibu.
One of the best is Lance Carson.
Say hello to the folks, Lance.
At-a-baby. when Lance goes out at Malibu, he really gives the place a going-over.
He stays in just the perfect spot on the wave, which is right in front of the white water... in the breaking part of the wave called the curl.
The main object in surfing is to always remain in the curl.
Stay as close as possible to the white water without actually getting caught by it.
All the maneuvers in surfing-- turning, stalling, trimming, riding the nose-- are directed toward the ultimate aim of staying in the curl.
Lance's real speciality is noseriding.
A lot of surfers run up to the nose.
A lot run up and right off the end.
Lance usually stays around for a while.
He's so relaxed up there, you get the feeling... he could have a ham sandwich while he's waiting around.
A surfer who can ride Malibu better than anyone in the world is Miki Dora.
As Phil Edwards says of Miki,
"His style is so advanced, most surfers don't even understand what he's trying to do."
He's very good at winding his way through the crowds at Malibu... without losing any of his composure.
On a small wave inside,
Miki with one of his unique maneuvers, side-slipping his board back and forth in the wave.
He's the only surfer
I've ever seen do this.
Mr. Miki Dora.
A young fella named Corky Carroll gets great rides... wherever he happens to be surfing.
Corky also comes up with some pretty strange things.
Here's a pretty strange pullout.
An "El Rollo." when Corky does something strange, everyone for 50 yards knows all about it.
"Hey, did you guys see that El Rollo?
Boy, it was a beauty!"
Yeah, big deal, Corky.
During the wintertime in California, the conditions really change.
The water temperature drops down to 48 degrees sometimes... at places like Steamer Lane in Santa Cruz.
Steamer Lane, home of the world's latest takeoff.
The only person comfortable surfing in this cold water is Henry.
Henry is a seal, nature's greatest bodysurfer.
Other places in California get big during the wintertime, like the Redondo Beach
Breakwater.
Although California isn't known for its big surf, you can see... occasionally it gets big, and biggest during the wintertime.
Many surfers ride summer and winter, but the ultimate thing for most of us would be to have an endless summer.
The warm water and waves, without the summer crowds of California.
The only way to do this is by traveling around the world, following the summer season as it moves around the world.
Two surfers,
Robert August and Mike Hynson, have been planning a trip like this for some time.
The winter evening before their departure, in front of a warm fire, reading up on a few last-minute books on Africa, which would be their first stop.
Robert August. Mike Hynson.
Packing for the journey was important.
Six pairs of trunks, two boxes of wax, some modern sounds and, in case of injury, one band-aid.
It was a cold, foggy winter morning in November... when Mike and Robert were ready to depart... on the first leg of their endless summer journey around the world.
On the plane heading for Africa,
Robert wondered what was in store for them. would the find surf? would they catch malaria? would they be speared by a native?
He didn't have any idea.
Across the U.S., then across the Atlantic Ocean, landing in Africa for the first time... at Dakar, Senegal.
They didn't know what to expect in Dakar, and at dawn at the airport, they were anxious to get under way... and find an inexpensive place to stay.
They were a bit perturbed when a government official informed them... they didn't have any choice-- they had to stay... at a certain government-owned hotel or leave the country.
So they had their introduction to primitive Africa... at one of the primitive little hotels along the seashore.
The rates here were unbelievable-- $30 a day each.
As you walk through the front door, they stamp
"sucker" on your forehead.
The joke turned out to be on the government, however, because right out in front of this hotel was a little island... about a quarter of a mile offshore.
And off each end of this island was surf breaking, surf that no one had ever ridden before... and, as far as we know, no surfer had ever even seen before.
It's pretty scary paddling out for the first time... at a strange spot like this.
They had no idea what they might find in the water.
So they stuck pretty close together.
For moral support, they took off together on the first wave, figuring if anything happened to them, it would happen equally... and probably wouldn't hurt so badly that way.
Takes a while to get used to any new surfing spot, but here in Africa, surfing for the first time, it takes a little longer.
Mike, on the left of the screen, pointing out a rock just underwater to Robert.
You find out where the rocks are, how the waves are breaking over the rocks or reef.
Find out if there's any funny little fish who might be mad-- things like that. what we call
"getting a place wired."
After you get it wired, it's just like... riding waves back in the U.S.A., except you aren't.
You're in Africa.
They couldn't get over being in Africa.
Mike would pull out of a wave, paddle over to Robert and say,
"Robert, guess what? we're in Africa!"
I don't know what it was, but it was really hard to accept.
They practiced the buddy system.
If one lost his board, the other would paddle over and pick up the board-- or body. whichever was closest.
You don't want to do a lot of swimming in the water down here.
Here they were, only four hours off an airplane from the United States, and already into better surf than they'd left behind them the day they left California.
They're still in the Northern Hemisphere, and although it's officially wintertime, the water temperature was 70 degrees.
They rode these waves knowing they were the first to ever do it, and also knowing the closest surfer to them was over
4,000 miles away.
This place broke a long way out, so most people didn't notice what was going on.
A few of the native kids spotted the activity and came to watch.
Being good Africans, they threw a few rocks.
Some of the sharp-eyed fishermen on the beach paddled out... to get a closer look in their full race canoes.
One of the fishermen was really stoked.
He was trying to shoot the shore break in his canoe.
Your surfing style in strange waters like this would normally be very conservative.
You could hardly call Mike's or Robert's style conservative.
Mike with a great ride--
Dakar, Senegal, west Africa-- completely covered up.
They figured at the rates they were being charged at the hotel, each wave was costing them about 9.95.
Mike hit the bottom and picked up a little ding on his head.
It was so expensive in Senegal, they decided to leave.
A cup of coffee costs the equivalent of one American dollar in Senegalese francs.
Their next stop would be Accra,
Ghana, about 2,000 miles down Africa's Gold Coast.
Landing in a strange country like this was pretty weird.
The people of course knew nothing about surfing and had never seen a surfboard.
They thought the boards were some kind of airplane wing.
Commonplace things for us like getting a ride with your surfboard were major projects.
They finally commandeered this taxicab and are trying to explain to the driver... that they want to tie the boards on the roof.
They even brought rope to do it with.
The driver didn't speak English and didn't understand.
Mike kept saying, "Look, they'll fall out of the trunk.
Let's put them on the roof."
The driver kept muttering something that must have meant,
"Airplane wings go in the trunk."
None of this was staged.
The discussion went on for half an hour, and the driver finally did it the way he thought was best.
Can you imagine driving down the highway in the U.S. like that?
They'd put you in prison.
They made it to a little hotel without the boards falling out, congratulating the driver for being such a good packer.
He really liked Mike and Robert.
Didn't even charge them for the ride, and offered to spend a couple of days with them... showing them around his country of Ghana.
No charge. All they had to do was buy gasoline for his cab. when they stopped to buy gasoline for his cab, it turned out to be not a very good deal.
Gasoline in Ghana is very expensive-- five-point-four-and-a-half shillings per gallon, almost one American dollar for a gallon of gas.
It was, as the name of it implied, really "Agip."
In a few minutes in West Africa, you can be out of a city into a very primitive area.
That's where they are now, at a primitive fishing village in Ghana.
Most of these people had never seen a white man before.
As they walked down the beach, they really wondered if they were doing the right thing.
They didn't know whether the U.N. had been there yet or not.
They were a little nervous on the beach, so they paddled right out in the water.
Paddling out, they had the horrible thought that maybe surfing... would violate some religious taboo of the natives, and they'd attack.
During the first ride, the hundreds of natives were dead silent, but went Robert pulled out, they really went wild.
[Shouting, Cheering]
That was the beginning of surfing in Ghana.
The people couldn't believe it.
They came down to the beach with their kids and their lunch... and they still had both hands free.
The natives had never seen or even dreamed of anything like this before.
They stood there for hours, completely fascinated.
If you lost your board, it would come inside, and the native kids would hop on it and play with it till you come and ask for it back.
Usually they'd give it back, but they were kids, and you were bigger than they were.
But you weren't bigger than the chief, who was bigger than anybody.
That's why he was chief.
If you lost your board and the chief wanted to play with it, there really wasn't much you could say about it. watch Robert trying to be tactful here.
"Hi there, chief.
Nice day, huh, sir? May I have my board back, please?"
One reason the natives were so excited about surfing... was because they themselves paddle out through the surf every day... in their big dug-out canoes to go fishing.
So they have a real feeling for the sea and waves, and could fully appreciate
Mike and Robert's ability on their surfboards.
This is really an interesting tribe of native fishermen.
Their method of fishing has remained unchanged for thousands of years.
Everything they have, they make themselves.
The ropes and nets are woven from some fiber they get in the jungle.
The canoe is hollowed out of a single, gigantic hardwood log. when they go stroking out to sea in their big dug-out canoe, and you're sitting outside, looking at them paddling toward you, you think they're coming out with their forks to have you for dinner.

In Native Language]
They couldn't speak English, and Mike couldn't speak their language.
They paddled by and said something like--
[Imitates Native Language]
Mike smiled and said,
"Yeah, man, hang 10."
They thought that was great.
They went stroking out, chanting, "Hang 10, hang 10!"
The only English word they know is "hang 10."
That has to be unique.
They lay the net in a big semicircle.
Normally they avoid riding waves in the canoes, but they thought they'd give
Mike and Robert a little thrill.
They did when they took off on a wave in their two-ton hardwood canoe.
♪♪ [Continues]
Surfing one of these things is like trying to surf the Santa Fe Super Chief.
They fish the same stretch of beach every day, and have been for hundreds of years.
If they move a mile up or down the beach, they run into another tribe of fishermen who have that area all staked out.
And if they infringe on each other's area, a big war starts and everybody gets massacred.
It's really a mess.
So they stay pretty much in their own area. with the last of the canoes coming in, everyone in the village... turns out to help pull in the big net.
♪♪ [Singing
In Native Language]
They all have duties.
Here's the head rope coiler.
♪♪ [Continues]
It takes them about an hour to get the net in, and they usually catch quite a few fish.
They have to divide the catch up among themselves.
They don't have any money, but they bargain for the fish anyway.
The session goes on for half an hour, with everyone hollering at each other at full volume.
Their approach is like,
"Look, Casafugo, I pulled harder, so I get more fish."
And the other guy says,
"Yeah, but I stayed up late last night worrying about it."
The other guy says,
"well, I'm bigger than you.
I'm taking the fish."
Part of it has to do with how big and strong you are and what you know.
This woman must have known karate.
The surfboards really attracted a lot of attention, as did Mike and Robert.
Robert with a big group surrounding him.
They were asking him questions in their native tongue, and he was answering what he thought might be the questions in English.
No one understood one word of what the other guy was saying.
But when you get surrounded by a group like that, you just don't just walk away.
The kids in the village really got excited about surfing.
They got so excited, they started ripping down their houses.
♪♪ [Continues]
The start of bellyboard surfing in Ghana.
♪♪ [Fades]
The kids wanted to learn how to ride a real surfboard, so Mike and Robert organized a little surfing school.
First thing the kids had to learn was to rough up the wax on the deck of the board... with some sand so they wouldn't slip off.
Plenty of help.
The biggest problem in the school was selecting one student.
They all wanted to be the student, and you can only teach one at a time, so you just looked around and tried to find a kid with a pair of trunks.
Teach him first.
Robert starting his student off near shore, pushing him into a wave.
First time this little
African boy had ever been on a surfboard in his life.
Mike didn't fool around near shore.
He started his students outside in the heavies.
If they let go of the board, they'd lose their turn as students, so they'd hang on to the thing sideways in the soup.
They weren't afraid of anything.
The best one of the day was a beautiful tandem late takeoff, sideways.
As is usual in West Africa, when the little guys try something and survive, the big guys take the boards away and go out and try it themselves.
A couple of the heavies got the boards and started stroking out.
Keep in mind these men had never seen a surfboard, let alone ever tried to ride one.
It takes most beginners a long time to just catch a wave.
In my years of surfing,
I've never seen anything like this.
The very first wave he tried.
- His buddies were really stoked.
- [Cheering]
They started getting kinda cocky after a while-- one-armed paddles.
These fellas were amazing.
They didn't have much trouble catching waves.
They didn't even have too much trouble standing up for a short time.
They had absolutely no trouble at all... getting the board back from the people inside.
Mike and Robert would have to argue, but watch when the heavy comes in to get the board.
No argument.
They started getting it really wired.
Some pretty hot angles going, and a beautiful El Rollo.
They even came up with a few original maneuvers.
A west African pullout here called a "reverse Patrice Lumumba."
These men were so excited about surfing that we felt sure after we left... they'd shape their own surfboard from some jungle tree... and are probably out there surfing right now.
The only problem came when the local constable walked up, said,
"Sorry.
No surfing after 11:00."
He didn't look too friendly, so we didn't argue.
The kids didn't like that rule.
They gave him a little lip, like, "How'd you like a black eye, cop?"
Their time just about up in Ghana, they strolled down the beach and said good-bye to the newfound friends.
Our next stop--
Lagos, Nigeria, just a short hop down the coast.
On these short flights, we took some pretty weird airlines.
This one was South Mombasa, with a U.N.-trained
African pilot... flying a war surplus DC-1.
Figured he'd give 'em a little thrill.
[Engines Roaring]
Once into Nigeria,
Mike and Robert hitched a ride... and struck off to look for surf in a place no one had ever surfed before.
The odds against finding surf in a strange country are pretty high.
Even getting to a beach is difficult. with their fantastic luck still with them, they hiked into a beach and paddled right out into some hot little waves. when I say "hot" in this case,
I don't refer to the shape of the waves, but to the actual temperature of the waves.
The water temperature here in Nigeria, almost on the equator, was an unbelievable 91 degrees.
It melted the wax right off the board.
The air temperature was about 100.
The humidity felt like 5,000%.
It felt drier underwater than it did up there in the air.
United Nations ship outside, ready to enter the harbor at Lagos, Nigeria. we have no way of knowing whether this is a good day of surf for Nigeria, or a bad one.
All we know-- it was like this when we were there, and it's still better than a lot of days we get in California.
Unlike Ghana, only one native watched.
He wasn't exactly overactive.
Neither would you be when it's 100 degrees.
It was so hot on the beach,
I decided to wade out in the water... and show you what it looks like if you're standing chest-deep in Nigerian water... watching Mike Hynson ride by, perched on the nose.
You keep one eye on Mike, and the other eye on the bottom... for creatures like stonefish that exist there.
If you step on a stonefish, you die in about 15 minutes.
Surfing a place like this is no problem.
The problem is finding it to begin with, and in this case, the problem was getting back to the road to hitch a ride.
They had to hike through a jungle between the beach and a road.
If you get off the path, you never find your way out.
This was a full-on jungle, full of all kinds of creepy things-- snakes, spiders.
They expected Tarzan to come swinging by on a vine.
[Airplane Engines whirring]
From Nigeria, they're headed to South Africa.
They'll be crossing the equator for the first time.
For the first time, it's now officially summer.
It was November.
Landing in Cape Town, they'll also be going to Durban,
1,200 miles up the coast.
The landmark at Cape Town that's as famous as Diamond Head... is Table Mountain.
Let's go up on top and take a look.
From the top, you can see a long way down the Cape Peninsula.
It's a finger of land about 20 miles long and five miles wide.
It separates two great oceans.
On one side of the peninsula is the Atlantic Ocean.
On the other, the Indian Ocean, ending in the famous
Cape of Good Hope.
It's a 2,000-foot vertical drop from Table Mountain... to the suburbs of Cape Town below.
Mike getting his jollies in for the day.
There are surfers in South Africa.
John Whitmore is the leader of the group in Cape Town.
John makes surfboards and sells Volkswagens.
There are about a hundred surfers around Cape Town, and when Mike and Robert arrived, all 100 of them took the day off to go surfing.
California surfers usually split up into small groups... and go to different beaches, trying to avoid crowds.
Here in Cape Town, they like to go all together.
Down the Cape Highway, past many beaches with no one on them and good surf.
But they don't split up.
They all go to the same beach.
It doesn't matter what beach, as long as they're together.
They were also anxious to see
Mike and Robert surf.
They get to the beach together, but when they actually surf, they split up into small groups.
One or two, 10 or 20--
They don't care.
The more, the merrier.
These are brave men.
As you can tell, they haven't been surfing long in Cape Town, but they really have a ball.
They get out there and really go at it-- bite, scratch, kick and really shove each other around.
John Whitmore, who made most of their surfboards.
He's also been surfing longer than most of the other people down there.
The South Africans were so enthusiastic about Mike and Robert's surfing ability, there were instances when surfers drove 400 miles just to meet them.
They'd drive 400 miles, get out of the car, shake hands and drive 400 miles back home again.
There are very few teenagers that surf around Cape Town.
Here's one of the few,
Peter Basford, getting a nice ride.
The average age around
Cape Town for surfers would be in their late 20s and 30s.
Mike and Robert were quick to make friends with the natives... wherever they visited.
Robert with a good pair of dark glasses on so they couldn't see where he was looking.
They spent a few happy days around Cape Town meeting natives, but they'd come here to get away from the crowds... and find a beach they could surf by themselves.
So they borrowed a car and struck off alone down the Cape Peninsula... to look for some surf.
If you want to be alone, you're welcome to be alone in South Africa.
It's one of the few places in the world you can even be alone on the main highway.
You pass many beaches with not a soul on them, not a footprint in the sand, and there hasn't been one in 10 years.
You can be so alone on the beach down there, it's almost scary.
They called this place
Long Beach... and paddled out for a few waves.
Conditions here resemble Northern California, with heavy kelp beds outside.
The kelp cuts the chop and makes the waves inside smoother, although it makes them smaller.
This is on the Atlantic side of the Cape Peninsula, and although it's summertime, the water temperature is only 54 degrees.
It never gets very warm on the Atlantic side of the peninsula, but only five miles away across land is the Indian Ocean.
The water there is sometimes
20 degrees warmer on the same day.
The best surf seems to be on the Atlantic side, so most of the surfing around
Cape Town is done in cold water, even in the summer. with the tremendous difference in water temperature between the two oceans... separated by such a narrow land mass, it causes some pretty good winds to blow.
Here's a little afternoon offshore breeze around Cape Town.
[wind whistling]
Nobody gets very excited about it.
They just tie their car to a tree and watch their kids as they go sailing by.
Mike and Robert decided to head for Durban, which is 1,200 miles up the Indian Ocean coast.
So off they went to Durban.
If you try to hitch a ride at Durban, you can sit there... for three days and never see a car.
As the hours rolled by and the warm summer sun beat down,
Mike couldn't help but think back to the summer that had passed in California, and the places that break during California's summertime, like The wedge in Newport Beach.
The dirty old wedge.
The dirty old wedge, where $6,000 worth of swim fins were lost last year-- and their owners.
The wedge in California, where you catch waves you didn't even want.
You come out of the water after a wave like this, your back looks like a Twist-O-Flex watchband.
Few people ride bellyboards at The wedge.
Bodysurfing is bad enough, because when you get wiped out, it feels like your arms, legs and head are all going different directions.
Add a bellyboard to that mess, it's like an extra piece of shrapnel in a hand grenade.
The waves break in very shallow water, so if you don't land just right, you can really get bent.
They come out with shovels at low tide and dig you out of the sand.
Usually on a big day, it's a very short ride.
It's kind of a big drop.
Occasionally someone gets a long ride.
Here's some kind of record for a big day.
I can't figure out whether this guy has a bellyboard... or is bodysurfing... or has rigor mortis of the stomach.
You may wonder why people don't occasionally land on each other.
As a matter of fact, occasionally they do.
In fact, they do it all the time.
Here's once.
This is the slam-bang, crowded action of California's summertime.
Mike Hynson and Robert August were glad they were here, especially when they looked down the highway... and saw the first car coming their way... in the shimmering heat waves of summer in South Africa.
There was a truck with a surfboard on top.
A surfboard's a rare thing to see in South Africa.
It turned out to be a young surfer named James... and an older fellow named Terence... who was taking James a few miles up the coast to go surfing.
They met, and Mike and Robert explained they were headed for Durban, 1,200 miles away.
Terence was only going a few miles, but he thought it over for a minute and said,
"what the heck?
Load your boards.
I'll take you to Durban."
On the spur of the moment,
Terence decided, and ended up driving Mike and Robert over 2,000 miles through South Africa, a trip that took him out of his way for two weeks.
Terence Bullen.
He doesn't surf.
He captures animals for zoos around the world... and milks cobra snakes for their venom.
He handles a thousand deadly cobras a week, and when he's not extracting their venom, he keeps them in baskets in his bedroom.
He's one of the few people in the world to capture an African elephant alive.
Terence wasn't afraid of anything in the world, except the ocean, and he wouldn't go in that for anything.
This is the truck he uses for hunting safaris.
This is the truck that took us
1,200 miles along the virgin coastline of the Indian Ocean.
If you thoroughly explored the surfing possibilities along the beaches, it would take you 10 years. we just concentrated on places right alongside the paved highway.
You pull off in the morning, look out. There'll be a place like this.
It doesn't even have a name.
So you go out for a wave before breakfast.
About 300 miles north of
Cape Town on the Indian Ocean, the water was 70 degrees.
Offshore breezes.
Perfect conditions.
There are hundreds of places like this up and down that 1,200-mile coastline... between Cape Town and Durban.
Mike out, along with James, who is just learning how to surf.
Robert stayed on the beach to keep his eye on Terence... because Terence had a habit of pulling tricks on them.
Like one time he caught a couple of cobras... and wrapped them up in their sleeping bags. when they unrolled the bags, he really laughed.
He thought that was hysterical.
This particular day, Terence got a couple of horses... and launched Mike and Robert down the beach.
They'd never ridden one in their lives. He laughed so hard, he almost got a hernia.
Robert with a death grip on an English saddle.
Threatened to drown Terence if he could catch him.
With this man, we drove thousands of miles through South Africa.
Mike's radio always at full volume.
Scared the daylights out of any animal around.
These animals are really an impressive thing to see.
You drive through countryside that looks like parts of the United States.
You almost forget you're in Africa.
But suddenly you remember when a big eland goes trudging off from beside the road.
It weighs almost a ton.
As the countryside changes, you see different animals.
A little further along, we saw a herd of impala having lunch... right beside the road.
Mike and Robert like to surf more than anything else, but they each felt they'd like to spend at least six months in South Africa... doing nothing but looking at animals.
It's really an impressive thing to see.
There are hundreds of different kinds, and Terence knew them all. with his sharp eyes, he could spot them about 10 miles away.
This is a bontebok, now rare.
Mike started his career as a game stalker in his camouflage shirt.
Terence would always send them out after things.
He'd say, "See how close you guys can get to those giraffes."
Then he'd lock the doors, roll up the windows, sit in there giggling like a maniac, tell you about the lion in the bushes later.
There are millions of monkeys in South Africa.
If you park your car out in the country and forget to lock it, the monkeys climb out of the trees, get in the car and take anything... that's not bolted down-- windshield wipers, radio knobs, everything in the glove compartment-- and pass it up to their buddies in the tree.
They've got a regular auto supply store going up there.
You come back and start yelling for your parts, they just giggle and throw you down a '38 Hudson hubcap.
There are many native villages.
This is a Zulu village. we were a little afraid to go in it, so Mike picked out the littlest guy to meet first.
He was more afraid than we were.
Arrow shirt going there.
Shot by an arrow.
He couldn't speak English, and we couldn't speak Zulu, so we just shook hands and tried to be friendly.
Robert called him "Mr. Clean."
Continuing the journey up the coast.
The further north you go in South Africa, the hotter it gets.
They drove all night, arriving in Durban first thing in the morning, and were greeted by some of the local surfers who live in the area--
Jack Wilson, Max Wetteland and Harry Bold.
Morning comes pretty early in Durban.
The sun is already up, and it's only 4:30 a.m.
Robert out for a few waves in the shimmering heat... of tropical South Africa--
Durban.
4:30 in the morning-- it's already 80 degrees out. water temperature about the same.
With the warm water, there's a tremendous problem with sharks.
Later in the afternoon, around 5:30 a.m., some more of the local surfers showed up.
They haven't been surfing long around Durban either, but they get some great rides.
They call their bathing suits down there "costumes."
In America, we call this thing a G-string.
As I mentioned, sharks are a tremendous problem here.
If you go in the water away from the main beach, the odds are 50-50 you'll be killed by a shark.
This beach is meshed, or netted against sharks.
But even here you keep your eyes open.
You look over the top of a wave and see a fin coming toward you, your heart stops.
If you're swimming, you really wish you weren't.
Turned out to be only a group of friendly porpoises... who were coming in to see what was going on in their ocean.
Shows you how well the nets work.
Everyone's happy to see the porpoises, because when they're around, they seem to keep the sharks away.
Sharks and porpoises have yet to integrate in South Africa.
After surfing, you can ride the Zulu rickshaw down the promenade.
It's a lot of fun.
All the tourists do it.
This driver wasn't very heavy, and he wasn't used to all the weight in the rickshaw.
He was bouncing along Zulu-style, bounced once too high... and got stuck up there.
Leaving Durban, heading to Johannesburg where we catch a plane for Australia.
Driving through the interior past these rugged thorn bushes... that reminded us so much of tough old Terence... and the dirty tricks he pulled, like telling Mike to go pet the zebra. what we remember most about South Africa... is a place we discovered with our friend Terence.
On the map, we could see a big cape sticking out seven miles to sea, a point of land called on the map Cape St. Francis.
It was about three miles across these sand dunes to the water. we had no idea what was on the other side, but we'd come halfway around the world, so we thought we'd go take a look. we struck off across the sand dunes led by our friend...
"Terence of Africa."
Halfway around the world and halfway across the dunes, it seemed like a bad idea.
It started to get pretty hot.
The odds were against us finding surf. we didn't even know if we'd find the water. when you go looking for surf, you don't look for a really big wave.
If you found one, you'd never ride it in strange waters.
It would be much too dangerous. what every surfer dreams of finding is a small wave with perfect shape. what we call a perfect wave.
The odds against finding that are
10 million-to-one.
They finally got their first look at
Cape St. Francis, South Africa.
You can't tell how good a wave is till you actually ride it.
On Mike's first ride, the first five seconds, he knew he'd finally found that perfect wave.
The waves looked like they'd been made by some kind of a machine.
The rides were so long,
I couldn't get most of them on one piece of film.
Here's Mike further along, still riding the same wave at Cape St. Francis.
On some of the rides,
I timed them in the curl for 45 seconds.
Outside, really driving about halfway through the wave already, Robert August.
Look at the wave in front.
Same perfect shape as the wave he's on.
After we rode Cape St. Francis, we talked to fishermen... who come in this area quite frequently.
They told us the waves there were funny looking things.
They said they looked like pipes.
And they said the waves always looked like that.
Day after day, same stupid looking waves.
They told us of days when the surf broke big out by the end of the cape, seven miles further out, and rolled all the way in to where we were surfing.
Can you imagine riding a 15-foot wave shaped like this for seven miles?
You'd have a nervous breakdown the first 50 yards.
I had one on a three-foot wave.
From all the information we could gather, we figure it's like this about 300 days of the year.
The water was 70 degrees, the prevailing wind there, straight offshore.
A perfect wave, and perfect conditions.
The only disadvantage was you kept getting cramps in your legs... from squatting down for so long in the curl.
The thing you can't show is the fantastic speed... and that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach.
It's the kind of a wave that makes you talk to yourself.
I couldn't help but think of the hundreds of years... these waves must have been breaking here.
But until this day, no one had ever ridden one.
Think of the thousands of waves that went to waste, and the waves that are going to waste right now at Cape St. Francis.
Out of the whole day of surfing, we didn't see one wave section, or break in front of itself.
Each wave was perfect.
The surf came in diagonally, which gave you this long ride-- was shallow, only a foot or two deep beneath Robert's board.
Sandy bottom with rocks along the shoreline.
Strictly a one-man wave.
Just wasn't room for two surfers.
Here, Robert's really in the right spot.
But Mike, with the wake of his board... causing the wave to break sooner than it normally would have.
Before long,
Mike was in the right spot.
Every surfer dreams of finding a place as good as Malibu or Rincon. we found a place that's better, and it's better every day.
The best ride of the day was one that Robert got-- really locked in, screaming at the top of his lungs.
Robert came over the top of the wave... and let out a bellow you could hear halfway back to Cape Town.
He was so excited, he was almost frothing at the mouth.
Mike was kind of excited too.
Oh, big deal. we've seen a lot of surfing so far in the endless summer.
Let's see what it looks like now when you're actually in the water riding... as we watch the amazing footwork of Mr. Phil Edwards in Hawaii.
I'd like to show you what a wipeout looks like from the board.
I'm pretty good at getting wiped out, so I'll be the stooge.
If you watch carefully, you can see the board pearl, the coral bottom and my head come by with bubbles coming out the ears.
You come up looking for your board and find... you have one extra hole in the head from the back of the camera. while Mike and Robert are making their way to Australia, let's see what's going on in Hawaii.
Lots of girls surf in Hawaii, and many of them are very good.
Taking off outside in the green...
"chest protector,"
Bernie Ross.
This is Haleiwa Beach on the North Shore of the island of Oahu in Hawaii.
Butch Van Artsdalen with a spinner.
There's a shallow spot in the reef at Haleiwa... right about there.
Butch Van Artsdalen, really a fantastic surfer.
Switches his stance back and forth, riding with either foot forward.
A few surfers do this, but none as well as Butch.
He does it in impossible situations, like right in the middle of a pullout in midair.
Right here.
Butch Van Artsdalen.
A surfer who's not as skilled as Butch... but who has as much fun as anyone's ever had surfing... is Lord James Blears, the famous wrestler.
Here goes the Lord with one of his famous
"Tallyho" pullouts.
Tallyho!
If he gets mad at the wave, he just crushes the poor thing.
The wave gets mad at you, it just crushes you right back again.
On a crowded day at Haleiwa, you see boards and bodies going in every imaginable direction.
Although by the calendar it's wintertime in Hawaii, the water is 75 degrees, and so is the air.
The temperature only changes about two degrees during the year.
So unless you have sensitive skin, you can't tell whether it's winter or summer in Hawaii.
Hawaii is truly a land of an endless summer.
Fella you saw at Malibu now riding Haleiwa,
Miki Dora.
Miki rides well frontwards... or backwards.
A Hawaiian surfer who's really fantastic is Conrad Cunha. when he plants his 200 pounds right over his feet, you get the feeling nothing could knock him off that board.
Just like he's glued down.
In fact his friends call him
"willie will Hold."
Out in front of Conrad,
Australian Mick McManus, really getting covered up.
There was a young fellow out surfing that day... who had a little trouble with a growth on his back.
Actually, his father fixed him up with a life preserver... so if he fell off he'd float... face down.
Dear old Dad. with a warm wind in Hawaii blowing, you'll often see the speedy
Pacific catamarans... out in the Ala wai Yacht Harbor having a ball.
Surfers when they're not surfing having almost as much fun.
The gusts of wind blowing out of Manoa Valley.
And when the crews hiking out to windward trying to hold the hull down.
Hiking out, hanging onto a thin line.
Thin, slippery line.
Once you lose your crew, you're liable to lose the whole boat.
These cats are a lot of fun in the harbor, but they're a real thrill on the open ocean riding ground swells.
Let's hop on board one now with Bob Casey... and Phil Edwards in the blue water off Diamond Head... and see what it looks like from on board charging at a ground swell at 20 miles an hour. water comes off the bow like it was shot from a fire hose.
Phil decided to cool off, troll for sharks. wiggle your toes three times and strike! whether you like to surf or sail, or surf a sailboat,
Hawaii, even in the winter, is truly the land of an endless summer.
Let's rejoin Mike and Robert.
They've left Africa, traveled up through India, across the equator for the third time down to
Perth, Western Australia.
Let's hop on down there and see what's going on.
They met some of the local residents, and a few surfers too.
A group of Australian blokes took Mike and Robert with them on a surfing trip.
They drove over a thousand miles in four days looking for surf.
Everywhere they went they were greeted with a familiar cry... surfers have heard a thousand times each,
"You guys really missed it.
You should have been here yesterday."
The roads aren't the greatest in western Australia.
When there are no roads, they just commandeer a tractor and manure cart... and get to the beach that way.
Down to a place called Ocean
Beach near the little town of Denmark, Western Australia.
Beautiful, deserted beach, but not much surf this day.
They were thinking of hiking down to the beach to go surfing anyway... when they saw an all-too-familiar
Australian site. we call them sharks.
They Australians call them
"the men in the gray suits." whatever you call them, they like your body.
The place didn't look that red-hot anyway.
The only wave they found in four days of searching around Perth... was the three-inch wake of this little boat.
Mike riding the wake unattached.
The people on the boat said,
"Gee, Mike, you should've been here yesterday. we had a bigger boat."
He braved the shore break and came in.
They picked up some surplus
Australian army hats that they hoped would change their luck.
Maybe they'd have better luck and strike some good surf at their next stop...
2,000 miles across the Australian continent to Melbourne.
They were greeted by some local surfers... and lost no time in heading from the city of Melbourne to Bells Beach... about 60 miles away with high hopes of hitting some summer surf.
Down the dry, dusty dirt road to Bells Beach.
They pulled up on the bluff to get their first look at the famous Bells Beach surf... and were greeted with the cry,
"You guys really missed it.
You should've been here yesterday."
There wasn't much surf, so they just went down to the beach to meet some of the local blokes... and found out an interesting thing.
Bells Beach is the fly center of Australia.
You go onto the beach and there are 30 flies assigned to your body. when you leave, they go back to command headquarters... and wait for another assignment.
They met a young fella named Rodney Sumpter who told them,
"You didn't miss it yesterday.
You missed it by about six months.
Because it's during the wintertime we get the best surf at Bells, round about July."
He said,
"Remember that dry dirt road you came in on today? well, during the winter, it's not a dry dirt road anymore."
Rodney said the surf isn't the same either.
And obviously it isn't.
He told them of all the great days of surf... he and Nat Young had had riding Bells Beach.
Nat Young here, only 16 years old, and one of the very finest surfers in Australia.
The winter conditions in Melbourne in July are very similar... to the winter conditions in Southern California in December. water temperature between 55 and 60 degrees, and general conditions about the same.
But it's Bells Beach,
Melbourne, Australia.
Here goes Rodney Sumpter, our storyteller, and also a great young Australian surfer.
He, too, 16 years old.
"Yeah," said Rodney.
"Should've come in July."
Rodney knew what he was talking about, so they asked him if he'd ever been back to Perth... where they'd just come from.
Rodney laughed and said,
"Sure, I've been back there.
Heck, I'm 16 years old.
I've been almost everywhere."
And Rodney told Mike and Robert all about a trip... he and Nat made back to western Australia.
Only they made their trip during the wintertime.
They went to the exact beach
Mike and Robert had been to--
Ocean Beach, Denmark.
Only the day they arrived, they had good luck and struck some beautiful little curls.
It's very difficult to get good waves when you're traveling around.
If you live in an area, you're bound to get a number of good days a year.
But if you're just passing through for a day or a week, the chances are you won't strike a really good day.
Nat and Rodney were lucky at the same beach
Mike and Robert hadn't been.
The Australians are very competitive surfers.
They always like to do one better than "the yanks" as they call us.
So if you go out and hang five, they'll go out and hang 10.
You hang 10, they'll do one better, which is something like hang body.
"Yeah," said Rodney.
"It was a good trip.
"But don't worry.
You're headed for Sydney.
"There's good surf there quite often in the summer.
With a little luck, you'll strike it good."
With a little luck, they struck it bad.
Three-foot wind chop, one-foot waves and three inches of rain.
So they went down to the beach and met some of the local rogues.
Out of any group of surfers, there's always one who will say the same thing.
"You guys really missed it.
You should've been here yesterday."
By now,
Robert was ready to snap.
He said,
"wait a minute, buddy.
"If you were in Hawaii right now at Waimea Bay, it might really be big.
And when I say 'big,' fella,
I really mean big."
That's what Robert means-- really big.
In fact, when Waimea Bay in Hawaii gets big, it's a whole specialized part of surfing.
They'll sometimes sit and watch it for a couple of hours before going out.
If it gets too big and closes out, the closest place you can get ashore... is 20 miles away.
Special boards are used called "big guns."
You have to wait for a lull in the shore break... before you can even try to get out.
Sometimes you'll stand there for half an hour... waiting for a chance to get through this shore break.
People started to gather and watch as the surfers who made it out... to sit in groups and talk nervously in low tones... waiting for the first big set of waves.
It's not uncommon to see fire engines and ambulances on the beach. when the first big sets come marching through, out you paddle with your heart in your mouth.
Someone's gotta turn around and take off on the first wave.
Miki Dora did... and wished he hadn't.
Greg Knoll rode Waimea Bay with such aggressiveness, he earned himself the nickname of "The Bull," hanging on through unbelievable masses of white water.
Only a handful of surfers actually ride these big waves.
Some of them are sportsmen.
Some of them are nuts.
Waimea Bay on the North Shore of Oahu in Hawaii.
This will give you an idea of the fantastic power of these waves.
A surfboard is as buoyant as a cork.
It takes a tremendous amount of power to hold one underwater. when Dick Brewer gets wiped out, watch how long his surfboard gets held down.
You'll finally see it pop up in the upper right hand corner of the picture.
Imagine what his body's been doing under there all that time.
The most dangerous thing in a big wave... is to get hit with your surfboard or someone else's board.
A surfboard hurled with the force of one of these waves can cut you in half.
So the most common sight you see at Waimea is surfers diving off, trying to get away from their board underwater to safety.
They're diving in awkward positions-- literally diving-- to save their own lives. when you see one of these big waves letting down in front of you, your heart's beating so fast, you can do a standing broad jump of 15 feet... and not even know it.
Just paddling out can be a national disaster.
You take off, make the steep drop, hear the white water rumbling behind you and feel the spray on your back.
You see you're going to make it into the safety of the shoulder.
It feels like the happiest day of your life.
Waimea Bay has only been ridden since 1958... when the first group of surfers challenged it.
Yet surfers watched it break for 10 years before going out.
Can you imagine the courage it took to be the first?
If you could harness the power of one of these waves, you could light a city... for a week.
This one really putting on a display of power, shooting plumes of white water
40 feet in the air, almost defying humans to challenge it.
"Yeah, fella, you really missed it."
The guy said,
"well, we're going out surfing here. You wanna go out?"
Robert said,
"No. I don't think so."
The Aussie said,
"Well, some of the kids are going out anyhow."
"Some of the kids in Australia are too much."
Mike and Robert figured,
"Well, it's not that bad out there."
They might as well go out.
This is one of the girl surfers in Australia.
Her name is Pearl.
"Hi, Mike."
Her bathing suit is nothing unique down there.
Most of the girls wear the same kind of a suit.
There's another girl paddling out.
Same type.
Doesn't bother anybody.
But it bothered Robert, and it bothered Mike.
Robert had never done a spinner in his life. when the girls get wiped out, they have some trouble losing parts of these suits.
The darn things are so little they roll up in a ball and go down a clam hole or something... and they never find them again.
The lifeguards down there carry spare bathing suits.
Carry 15 in a Band-Aid box.
Mike Hynson and Robert August were quick to make friends... with the natives in any country they visited.
Pearl had to go home.
Mike was one of the last of the good guys, so he said he'd run her on home.
All Robert could say was,
"Ah, fudge."
Leaving Australia, we're headed 1,200 miles across the Tasman Sea... to New Zealand.
This is really a beautiful country, with high mountains and waterfalls.
It's about the size of California, but with only two million people.
There are 10 million sheep in New Zealand.
More sheep than people.
This is one of the beautiful
East Coast beaches.
Perfect conditions, but surf that rarely gets over three feet.
On the West Coast, it's a little more rugged.
The surf on the west Coast rarely drops below six feet.
The wind usually blows about 20 knots, making poor surfing conditions.
John Paine and Tim Murdoch, two New Zealand surfers we met-- they took us on a trip leaving from Tim's house near Auckland, heading to the extreme northeast tip of the island, a place called Ahipara.
Driving there Tim and John explained Ahipara was a well-known surfing spot.
A lot of people surf there.
Last year, they figured probably... three or four.
Here's the cove at Ahipara on the extreme northeast cape... of New Zealand's North Island.
Robert and John Paine paddling out for a wave... with horses clomping along the path in the background-- people coming in from the sheep ranch.
This is considered a fair sized day for New Zealand's East Coast.
That's part of a paddle wheel of an old steamship that went aground.
It's Christmastime in New Zealand right in the middle of their summer.
They think of Santa Claus as a guy who wears Bermudas and hangs out on the beach.
Tim and John went home to spend Christmas with their parents... and left Mike and Robert to explore New Zealand by themselves.
Heading from the East to West Coast, you pass through the mountains.
Mike and Robert stop to sample a little of the world-famous...
New Zealand trout fishing.
A pleasant way to spend a day, and also a good way to pick up something to eat.
They fished for a few hours and caught quite a few trout.
This is just a baby trout by New Zealand standards.
It only weighed about two pounds.
It has to be over two pounds to even be legal size.
Here's some of the regular fellers they caught.
Four and five pound rainbow and brown trout.
That evening, they had roast trout on a stick.
Page 44 of their woody woodchuck manual.
But it tasted pretty good.
They had enough fish for weeks.
They had trout for dinner, trout sandwiches for lunch, flaked trout in their mush in the morning, rotten trout.
They camped out that night in the mountains of New Zealand... and struck off the next morning for the west Coast... and a place called Raglan.
It's an amazing country to drive through.
One minute there's a cool mountain stream.
Around the corner, a thermal area with a pit of bubbling mud.
On down to Raglan on New Zealand's west Coast.
This is the huge cove at Raglan, many miles across and a couple of miles deep.
The lines of surf rapping in from the Tasman Sea.
It was blowing about 15 knots, which is considered fairly glassy for the west Coast. watch Mike catch his fin on a rock here just underwater.
Oop.
It was Christmas Day, and they had the huge cove at Raglan all to themselves.
The most unique thing about this place is the length of the ride.
The ride's so long it's ridiculous.
I can't even show you a complete ride.
It would take the whole second part of the film.
So I'll show you kind of highlights of one of Robert's rides.
This is about the middle part of the ride.
Later in the day, here's some more of the middle part of the ride.
Once the novelty of the long ride wears off, it gets kind of boring.
You start talking to yourself, reciting poetry, yodeling-- anything to keep your mind occupied.
This is the shore break.
It only lasts for about 15 minutes.
You go out surfing for the day at Raglan, you get two rides-- one after breakfast, and one after lunch.
If you try for three, you starve to death.
Surfers here don't carry wax.
They carry life-raft rations.
Mike and Robert riding it together in the afternoon... so they'd have someone to talk to.
Mike was discussing highlights of the trip.
Robert kept saying,
"watch where you're going, Mike.
If you fall off, you won't get in till tomorrow morning."
Drying off after the day of surfing in the afternoon summer sun of New Zealand, they remarked to each other how ironic their trip had been so far.
In Africa, where they really didn't expect to find surf, they found such good waves.
In Australia that has good surf, they'd been unlucky and hadn't gotten anything.
Here in New Zealand, they'd had a few pretty good days, but they knew it could've been even better.
That's what it's like when you're following the summer around the world... looking for places to surf.
Their next stop would be the island of Tahiti.
Ask anyone who's been there and they'll tell you the same thing-- there's no surf in Tahiti.
The reason they say is because this barrier reef... cuts up all the surf coming into the beach.
But it makes for crystal-clear waters in the lagoons.
This is about six feet of water we're flying over with coral and sand on the bottom.
Didn't take Mike and Robert long to get into the swing of things in Tahiti.
A flower behind that ear means they're not married.
And they kept hollering,
"Hey! I'm not married!"
Although there's no surf, they thought they'd go paddle in the lagoon.
And although there's no surf, they found something that looked kind of like a wave.
They called this place
"El Stumpo."
They named it El Stumpo after the famous
Polynesian explorer...
Leonardo El Stumpo.
The waves weren't gigantic, but they were well formed little devils.
You could see the waves breaking on the reef in the background.
There was a pass through the barrier reef, and the swells were coming through and breaking near the beach.
For such a tiny little wave, you could really get worked over.
Everyone said there was no surf in Tahiti, but they had already found some, so they thought they'd better drive around the island... and take a good look.
Off they went through the famous town of Papeete.
You get to one side of the island, and you find everyone's wrong.
There is surf in Tahiti.
There's no barrier reef at all on one side of the island.
There's all kinds of surf rolling into the black sand beaches.
Just a matter of finding the right beach... with the right bottom contours, the right swell direction, and you'll find a place to surf. we found an interesting spot. we called it "Ins and Outs"... because you could ride the wave in, or you could ride the wave out.
The wave going out had better shape than the wave did coming in, so they spent most of the time riding out.
The waves would roll in, up the steep beach, back down the steep beach and right back out to sea again.
Had enough shape and power-- you could turn, run the nose, just like you were riding in.
Except you weren't.
You were riding out.
The Tahitian kids had ridden out most of their lives, and they were busy riding in on their surf mats and belly boards.
But when they met the out part, shazam!
Three ways to go-- in, out and up.
Everyone inside was drowning.
Here's the Royal
Tahitian kid, Irving.
He's got the shiniest skin on the block.
Mike with a record long ride out at Ins and Outs, heading straight out to sea, straight toward Hawaii.
I couldn't help but feel sorry for the Tahitian kids having so much fun surfing.
They didn't know there was no surf in Tahiti.
This place got kind of confusing, so Mike and Robert paddled down the beach a few hundred yards... and found another surfing spot.
They called this other spot
"The Other Spot."
It was a pretty good spot too.
The best waves came through right in the middle of a rain squall.
It was kind of weird when it rained.
The rain was 75 degrees.
The water was 75 degrees.
The air temperature was 75 degrees.
It was so pleasant, it almost made you sick to your stomach.
The people in Tahiti were really insistent about there being no surf.
Mike came out of the water once and a man said, "Hey, there's no waves in Tahiti."
He'd been standing right there watching Mike surf.
Mike didn't want to be a smart aleck, so he just said,
"Well, sir, they're pretty good things, whatever you call 'em."
Here's Mike with a nice ride on a Tahitian thing.
On their last evening, they set out beyond the breaker line... and remarked to each other how ironic it had been again.
Here in Tahiti where there's not supposed to be any surf... they found three places,
El Stumpo, Ins and Outs, and the Other Spot.
Their next stop would be Hawaii.
On the plane, they were anxious to get to Hawaii.
They didn't have to look for surf anymore. They knew right where to find it.
Mike was itching to get his feet in a board in Hawaii and get a few waves.
It wasn't long before he did.
Good old Hawaii.
It sure was great to be back in the Islands.
No more searching for surf.
Just go out and ride in the warm blue water.
Good old Hawaii and the friendly natives.
And the junior birdmen.
Ooh! Oh!
Good old Hawaii and the dirty old nasty Pipeline.
This is the surfing spot that's hardly even a surfing spot.
It's more like a Roman gladiator's pit.
So dangerous, it almost defies description.
The way the waves break is bad enough.
But it's also very shallow, and on the bottom is coral.
Not the usual formation, but coral that sticks up like big overgrown railroad spikes.
You hang onto your board, you go over the falls with it every time, guaranteed.
Any wipeout at the Pipeline in Hawaii is a bad one.
And most places, when someone gets wiped out, everyone watching on the beach laughs.
No one laughs at the Pipeline.
They wait and see if you come up again.
No one laughed very hard when Bob Pike came out of the water... with a broken collarbone and three broken ribs... from bouncing off the shallow bottom.
You ride this place with a different attitude.
You don't want to fool around.
You want to make that wave more than anything in the world.
A surfer who rode the place better than anyone thought ever imaginable... was Butch Van Artsdalen.
The waves came marching through and Butch kept doing impossible things, getting impossible rides on impossible waves to ride.
It seemed like
Butch was invincible, like he could do nothing wrong, coming through one unbelievable tube after another, almost making this wave--
Not quite.
The wave hit his board dead-center, and Butch had two halves.
You can drive a car over a surfboard and it won't break.
But a wave at the Pipeline can easily snap one in half. when the collapsing wave squirts air and water out the end, it sounds like a jet plane taking off.
If you're standing there, you get blown right off your board.
There's so much adrenaline pumped through your system on a wave like this... that when you get to the shoulder, the easy part, you're so relieved, you just sometimes fall off in a semi faint.
The worst wipeout I've ever seen was Danny Derone at the Pipeline.
An upside-down, head-dip, human pile driver. watch this terrible wipeout.
Danny came up smiling, and we thought he'd snapped something loose in his head.
Mike and Robert, their first day back in Hawaii, and already they'd been into some good waves.
They'd be into some more good waves the next morning.
But they couldn't help but think back to the many things they'd already seen and done.
The animals, and especially the perfect wave they discovered and rode... at Cape St. Francis in South Africa.
They missed these things, but there wasn't a much better place to be than Hawaii.
In a couple of months when the season changed, they'd return with the summer season to their homes in California. with enough time and enough money, you could spend the rest of your life... following the summer around the world.
But for now, the endless summer must end.
This is Bruce Brown.
Thank you for watching.
I hope you enjoyed my film.
World in Action... enters the struggling, changing world... of the seven year old.
They're teddy bears, they're not real.
A Polar, look at those claws.
This is no ordinary outing to the zoo.
It's a very special ocassion.
We brought these twenty children together for the very first time.
They are like any other children... except that they come from startlingly different backgrounds.
No!
No feeding, it says.
Stop it at once
I know there's no feeding but it doesn't really matter.
We brought these children together... because we wanted a glimpse of...
England in the year 2000.
The shop stewards and the executives of the year 2000 are now seven years old.
Give me a child until he is seven... and I will give you the man.
Let's get to know these children.
Taking her little sister to school on the London Council Estate,
Jackie.
From the Yorkshire Dales,
Nicholas.
He goes to a one room village school... four miles away from his home.
From this Liverpool suburb...
We chose...
Neil.
And this is Tony.
His girl friend calls him a monkey.
He goes to one of the oldest schools... in the East End of London.
Would everybody, please sit round now?
Get on with their work, I don't want to see any backs to me.
Shouldn't be anybody turning around...
Tony, do you hear as well?
Next to Tony there is his girl friend,
Michelle.
Tony!
Don't turn around again!
In this class room,
Waltzing Matilda... is being rendered in Latin.
This is an exclusive pre-prep school... in Kensington.
I think the Beatles are mad... because they make too much noise... and their hair-style's so bad.
If they composed softer music...
I wouldn't mind so much.
I just loathe their hair-cuts
That was John.
If you loathe their hair-cut... you wouldn't have liked
Henry the Fifths hair-cut.
This is Charles.
And that is Andrew.
This dormetary is in a children's home... supported by charity.
This is Paul... and Simon.
I had a dream when all the world was on top of me... and everything was on me, and I just about got out and everything flew up in the air... and that all landed on my head.
Go on Potter.
If you don't now, don't go.
Now shoot!
- We're going to!
My heart's desire is to see my daddy who is six thousand miles away.
Bruce doesn't live with his parents either... but for a different reason.
He goes to a private boarding school in Surrey.
Bruce wants to be a missionary.
I think the most important thing in the world is everyone should know about god.
I think we should give all... some... most of our money to the poor people.
In the head mistress' study... of a fashionable school for girls... we met Suzie.
We spoke to her "deep in the chintz" of the staff room.
Tell us, do you have any boyfriend Suzie?
Ummm... yes!
-Tell me about him.
He's up in Scotland and I think he's thirteen. and I'm rather lonely up there because he usually goes to school. but we usually play till about... half past six when he comes home from school.
Then we go in and then... he goes home to do his homework.
The world of the seven year old... can be primitive... even violent.
What do the children themselves think about fighting?
Is it important to fight? Yes!
Well I feel like joining in when there's already a fight.
I always feel like that.
I always feel like joining in when there's already one.
Neil from the Liverpool suburb.
We don't do much fighting in school because we think it's horrible and
It hurts.
Sometimes we play nice with the boys and sometimes we argue with the boys.
- Susan, Jackie's friend.
- Do you ever fight with them?
- No, just argue
Most of the time we are all right.
But. one day when
I remember we were all coming to school and at break time they started hitting us and so we started to fight! so we said we're never gonna play with you again.
But we always do.
If they fight me I think someone if someone comes up and starts fighting... then I think it serves them right
We play with Richard the
Lion Heart and William Tell.
Well... we pretend we got swords... and then we make the noises of the sword-fighting... and when somebody stabs us we'll go
....'aaaaaahh'!
Nicholas from Yorkshire... seven this year.
I have quite a lot of fun when I fight...
I always like to wait till someone... you better watch out for me... because as soon as you're not looking...
I like to dash up and put my hands in front and hit them against your back.
And on the grass... we... we play international wrestling.
Yeah that's only in the summer time though. yes summer we can go on the grass.
I just like fighting somehow.
- Yes, tell me about it.
I just want to. He was in the washroom and threw soap at me
I chased him in the class and I hit him
When I was down in the place at Kent... there was this little boy who I think was younger than me... and... my Nanny was having a game with him... and he was a naughty boy because he slapped me in the tummy.
Some boys can be nice and others can be horrible.
And then he slapped Nanny... and I didn't like that kind of boys.
Jacqueline, what do you think about boys fighting?
Well... its really silly to fight because... if you fight and Miss comes in the class-room then you only get told off
I think discipline is fair enough.
Farmer is the sergeant and he is quite a good one, last term he wasn't...
He had a cold and he didn't want to wear his voice out from shouting.
And that's Farmer.
He gives me nightmares.
The vast majority of the seven years olds know little of discipline.
But a few, from the moment they are born... are trained to accept it. squad steady squad left foot in one place squad breathe in
Well I don't like the big boys hitting us
The prefects sending us out for nothing. And they the staff in washroom sends the nurse out where there is no talking, no
I wasn't talking today... and Brown set me up for nothing.
I think the system of having House Captains... is rather good because when somebody's naughty the House Captain asks him and... and... and has a talk to him.
Once I had a talk to Gravel he was in my house... and...and I asked Sir he could put him out of my house because... he was always getting minuses.
What did the sir say?
-Yes.
The sir said that he was... he... we would see about it this term.
Well... I think it's a very good system.
And you had to speak to anyone?
Just because you are one, I suppose.
No, no,
I haven't.
You're not are you?
But I am. Straull Meckanace. got three minuses in a day.
He is a pest.
You think, House Captain should be elected or appointed by sir?
Appointed.
Appointed
I think its more fair to have elected.
Yes. So do I but I think it is best to be appointed. -Because you didn't...
It saves lot of time.
-It doesn't!
Appointed!
It is much easier because all that you have to do is... count up the pluses and here you are.  -Yes!
At Suzie's school... the exercise is classical ballet.
For Neil and his classmates... its free movement to music.
Michelle and her friends are left to amuse themselves.
This distinction between freedom and discipline is the key to their whole future.
What about after school?
What do they do in their spare time?
When I've gone home, I have tea.
Then I practice my piano.
And then I practice my recorder.
Then I start watching television.
What time do you go to bed?
When I have my bath at six o'clock... and then go to bed at seven and read till half past seven.
I usually go to bed at ten o'clock or eleven o'clock.
When I go home...
I go and see my mother... and I have tea and watch t.v.... and then I... I do my homework and then I go and see my father.
And then what time do you go to bed? last night I didn't go to bed until seven.
When I go home, I come...
I come in and mummy gives me a cup of tea... and then I go out and play.
And when it starts to get dark...
I come in again and put on t.v.
I am the only child in the village except for my baby brother. he was one last Friday...
I mean the friday before last Friday...
Neil from Liverpool, said he prefered living in town.
Because in the winter, if you lived in the country... it would be just all be wet and there wouldn't be anything for miles around
And you get soaked if you try to go out and there's no shelter anywhere... except in your own house.
But in the town you can go out on... wet, wintery days because you can always find somewhere to shelter... because there are lots of places.
They'd like to come out for a holiday in the country when we like... when I like the holiday in the town.
In Tony and
Michelle's school... unlike others... boys and girls are brought together in the class room.
And they meet quite naturally in the cinema queue on Saturday morning.
Sometime on Saturday mornings I go to the cinema
Sometime with my friends and sometimes with him.
You don't!
- I do! she doesn't
I don’t always see you you go to a different cinema last week i went to the.....where you go yeah but i didn't go
How much does mixing or segregating the sexes matter?
What effect does it have on what boys and girls think about each other? will it influence their chances of love and marriage?
We asked the children what they thought about the opposite sex.
Tell me do you have any girlfriends?
Well... not many.
What do you think about girls? well not much.
I don’t think much of girls.
Touch a boy, kiss a boy.
Sometimes we get our own back and say... catch a girl and kiss a girl.
Yeah
And what was that?
The girls are always screaming.
-Yeah
When we catch them, we kiss them,
-Yes.
And when its catch a boy, kiss a boy when the girls catch us, they kiss us.. they say 'aaaaah'...
-Yeah. but much louder though.
If we did... all love Jeffrey we all want to marry.
- Yeah.
I think I know the one that he likes best and that's her.
Susan most of all likes Lesley
She told me before.
-Do I?
You said, she keeps changing her mind though
Yeah! I don't know which one really
Well, my girlfriend is in Africa... and  I don't think I have another chance of seeing her again... and there were two in Switzerland which
I liked too in a hotel, Park Hotel.
Well, I know he is hers...
He loves her.
I don't, I love him.
And these two...
I love you, I love Christopher
See, he loves Suzan because Suzan loves him.
He loves Lindsay and Lindsay loves him.
-I don't love him once Caroline Tetford said
She loved me.
-And what happened after that?
And I am going to marry...
I marry her when I grow up.
I hate her. She's always getting bad tempered and cross with me.
Is she?
Yes! Neil Hughes! Move your desk forward and sometimes... and sometimes... when...when she is supposed to have the chair on the back of the desk... and when I take it... when I put it back... she says, 'Neil Hughes!' take your chair forward.
And she just gets into a girly cross with me like that.
I'd like to get married when I grow up.
But I don't know what sort of boy but I think one... thats not got lot of money but is... has got some money.
Not a lot though!
Would you like to get married Paul?
Tell me why not!
I don't like it. Say... say you had a wife...
Say... say you have to eat what they cooked you
And say I don't like greens well I don't...
And say... she says you have to eat what you're given... so...
I don't like greens so if she gives me greens then... then that's it
When I get married I don't want to have any children...
Because they are always doing naughty things and... making the whole house untidy.
When I get married I will like to have two children.
You'll have Nanny to look after but you won't look after them?
No I want a
Nanny to look after them.
If I could I would have two girls and two boys.  -Yes so would I
And what about you Jackie?
My Mom because she got five girls she had seven years bad luck and seven years is a bad luck thats why she has got five girls.
And so... when my baby was supposed to be born... and we all wished it was a boy but...
But we were all waiting in my nans for my dad 'cause he visited her he came home and said
"it's another girl kids" we all said "awwwww!"
What do you think about girl friends at your age?
I've got one but I don't think much of her.
No but I said that when boys go around with girls... they don't pay attention to what they're doing.
My Grand mother had an accident because... a boy friend was kissing... his girl friend in the street.
The girls never... never... never do what the boys want them.
They always start playing with dolls... when boys want to play rough and tumble.
-It's not true!
They're rather boring you never get a chance to play with them and things like rough and tumble...
And they always start playing with their dolls.
Yes... as soon as you start...
-and silly things like that...
Only intelligent girls start playing with you -and they always take you away... from whatever game you are playing yourself.
Yes! They say `I don't want to play that game with you...' and they don't stop crying.
- Yes!
Do you have a girl friend?
I don't want to answer that.
I don't want to answer those kinds of questions.
They Love.
-That's right!
Back to love, 'amo'.
Now let's have the present tense of 'amo'.
Amos, amas, amant... anamus, amatis, amant.
Yes, What's the last one?
Amant!
-Amant.
Fill up the gaps on the board there
Have a little chalk?
-Yeah
In your best writing please. All right!
What's Major... what's
'amatis' mean?
We love.
No, Holden. Amatis?
You love.
-You love! Second person, isn't it?
Yes sir.
That was silly wasn't it
Now then Russell, let's hear the present tense of 'porto'.
Porto, portas, portat, portamus, portatis, portant.
-That's right!
Holden, let's hear the present tense of 'evasto'.
Evasto, evastas... evastat, evastamus, evastatis. evastant.
Yes, speak up.
Now let's... what does `evasto' mean?
I...
All right, let's...
Well, got it?
- Lay waste.
`Evasto'- to lay waste!
All right.
All right you can talk again.
Are the children themselves aware of differences between rich and poor? have they learned prejudice.
What do they think about money?
I think it's not a bad idea to pay for schools... becasue if we didn't... schools would be so nasty and crowded.
Yes.
-So do I think so.
Yes!
And... people in the schools wouldn't
-And poor people would come rushing in
The man, in charge of the school... would get very angry because he would...
And he would get bankrupt.
-because he wouldn't...
He wouldn't be able to pay all the masters if he didn't get any money.
Yes. I think he would get bankrupt because paying all the...
What does bankrupt mean?
Having no more money and go to prison
Why do you have to go to prison? That's strong!
Because that obviously means you've been spending it too much.
I've got twenty three three penny pieces... and I don't know how many half penny pieces I've got now
I read The Financial Times.
I read Observer and The Times.
What do you like about it?
Well, I like...
I usually look at the headlines then read... about them... about it.
I like my newspaper because I got shares in it and I know everyday what shares are
-The stuff misers like you like
No. But... on Mondays they don't move up so I don't look at it.
What would you do if you have lots of money, about say... two pounds?
Me?
I would help the poor.
Yeah because the poor if you don't help them they would die
Wouldn't they?
And everytime we've a harvest festival, we send them food.
Once these two, no Susan and Janet went round giving food out
What do you think about rich people?
Well... not much.
Tell me about them
Well, they think they can do everything... without you doing it as well and they think just because they're rich... and they have to have people like they have to do all their work and stuff.
I don't think much of the accents.
Neither do I.
-Neither do I.
That doesn't prevent me liking them.
Poor children, they boast about themselves. - No they don't.
Rich children boast about themselves and say how clever I am and things like that
Yes, and rich children always make fun of poor children, I hate.
Yes. -Yes they say, look at that lovely little sissy and they laugh at them.
Yes, and they throw things at them.
Yes.
And poor child gets scared to death.
The posh ones
Oh Yes. Oh yes. Oh Yes.
They're nuts! you just have to touch them
Jacqueline, what do you think about coloured people?
You said to me once that you like them but what do you really think about them?
Well, they're nice and its as same as us really... but one thing... it's only because their skin is brown and we're white... sort of pinkish we're.
Some people from Africa come here... but when they go, they put their clothes on
I've only seen them on television and places like that.
I don't... I don't know anybody who is coloured.
I don't want to know anybody who is coloured. Thank you very much!
Coloured people. I don't like them very much.
No... it sounds like ghostly coloured people.
Do you think of a purple person... with red eyes, yellow feet and...
I can't really think of what they really look like.
They are just same as me, aren't they?
What do they think about each other?
And how'll they act together?
To find out, we invited them all to one big party... and joined in
Tell me what did you three think about... the other children that you met today... and all that, there were quite varieties?
Yes but they were bit too tough for my liking.
Some hit me right in the back and
I 've still got some pain there.
And well, some of them were rather dirty. what did you think about them?
-I played with them quiet naturally.
I think they were rather nice, really.
I don't like the boys.
Those three,  I don’t like all of them. None of them.
What about the girls?
Yeah, I liked that girl... but not the boys.
Why?
Because once I pulled his scarf he said,
'Don't you pull my scarf' and I hate him
And when we were at that park... he went round punching everybody.
If some of our children didn't get on with each other... does it really matter?
After all... they're not likely to meet in the same class room.
At the Kensington school... all the boys are being prepared for public school places and universities... whereas of these thirty children getting their milk from Tony.
Only, three are likely to win a place at a grammer school.
Indeed, the vast majority will leave school... and start work at fifteen.
What plans do the children themselves have?
When I leave the school, I'm going to College Court... and then I would be going to Westminster
Boarding School if I pass the exam.
Then we think, I am going to Cambridge and Trinity Hall.
What does university mean?
Well... before I'm old enough to get a job
I'll just walk around and see what I can find.
When I leave the school, I go to Broadstairs, St. Peter's Court.
And after that I'm going to Charter House.
And after that Trinity Hall, Cambridge.
I like to be like Kathy Kirby
I want to be a jockey when I grow up. Ya
I want to be a jockey when I grow up.
When I leave school...
I'm going to the Dragon School...
I might.
I might go to Charles
House, Marlborough
And...
I can't.... remember all other places... because mummy has got so many places... and those're some of them.
What about university Charles?
I might go to Oxford.
Well...
I don't think I need to go to university
'cause  I'm not gonna be a teacher.
I don't think you want to go to university if you want to be an astronaut
When I grow up, I want to be an astronaut but... if I can't be an astonaut
I think I'll be a coach driver.
Tell me about the coach driver.
Well, I'm going to take people to the country... and sometimes take them to the sea-side and...
And I'll have a big loud speaker on the coach and tell them where about we're... and what we're going to do.
And what's the name of the road is.
All about that.
When... if I can't be an astonaut
I would like to be a... a bridal sergeant in the police force... like my dad is.
I was gonna be a policeman but... how thought how hard it would be to join in.
When I leave the school,
I'm down for Heathfield and
Southfield Manor and then maybe,
I may want to go to a university... but I don't know which one yet.
I'll buy myself a nice new made house you know. one that’s all nice and comfy.
I am going to work in Woolworths
When I grow up I like to find out all about the moon and all that.
Well, going to Africa... and try and teach people... who are not civilized... to be more or less good.
At the end of their very special day in London... after their trip to the zoo and the party... we took our children to an adventure play ground... where they could do just what they like.
There's from a children's home set about building a house.
That's Nicholas.
And Tony.
Andrew.
And Bruce.
John.
Suzie.
Jackie and her friends.
Give me a child until he is seven... and I will give you the man.
This has been a glimpse of Britain's future.

A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE
You'll have to excuse my words, my expressions, because I never went to university.
But I have to tell you something very important about how I suffered.
THE EXECUTIONS IN PATAGONIA
I witnessed the first uprising in Patagonia.
We asked for an increase in our wages.
Back then, the English, who were in charge in the south, asked for back-up to crush the riots.
They let them believe we were
Chilean and Argentine bandits who were destroying properties.
They sent Colonel Varela to the army.
We had give up our arms.
They let us dig trenches, and when the trenches reached the height of our necks, they started to shoot, killing thousands of peasants, workers, fathers, real Argentines.
That's what happened in Patagonia.
THE MASSACRES OF THE PEASANTS
The uprising of the Chaco took place in 1920.
Terrible, dramatic... I saw mothers with their children in their arms pursued by the bullets of the police.
Villa Guillermina, Villa Angela revolted.
I have no words to describe what they did then!
THE REPRESSIONS OF THE WORKERS
"The Tragic Week" was a really heroic moment.
There were men, workers, behind the barricades, and also women and youth, fighting the police.
They overtook an army regiment...
...and the police... and even the firemen, who had never touched a rifle.
THE STORY OF THE BATTLE
OF THE MILITANTS
So, compañeros...
All I have told you is only a summary of my battle as a militant worker at the source of a syndicate.
Now I will learn from you.
And I would like you to continue with enthusiasm.
Because the fall of capitalism is only a matter of a few years away.
LETTERS OF THE COMBATANTS
During the shooting of this film we asked several comrades their opinion on violence and liberation.
And here is the first one:
THE TRAP OF LEGITIMACY
You've asked me what's missing in order for us to regain power.
I don't know. But I know what we have: naivety.
I remember that day, at the beginning of 1956, when we went looking for
Suarez at his coastal resort... trying to revive a place that was definitely dead.
I remember Suarez, and how he tried to hide his impotence and fear.
We blamed Suarez, but it wasn't entirely his fault.
For 10 years, he had behind him the support of our government.
And suddenly he found himself left with nothing at all.
He had been trained to compromise, and not for battle.
How could we ask more of him than he was capable of?
How many battles have we fought in the past?
The story you told in the film just gives an approximate idea.
We believed that, after every big mobilization, Perón would return and we would regain power.
Today, thinking of that answer, the image of Suarez was projected on many of us.
I had a new naive feeling which affirmed that the people's will would be enough to impose a new October 17th.
The same naivety moved many of us to believe and to have confidence in the legal way.
Accept the legal way?
Did this mean to accept legalized violence?
Isn't this social peace, one behind bars, slavery, and a national humiliation?
Suarez had understood that his legitimacy, and that of the people, had been defeated... and he quit the battle.
We continued to see legality as an abstraction and a myth.
We have been the best civil workers... and we have educated the comrades in that spirit.
At every defeat, we answered with a battle that wasn't really revolutionary policy but resulted in temporary measures.
The Suarezes of yesterday, hiding their impotence and their fear, are today returning in even larger numbers.
Like 10 years ago, you can feel the need for a change.
How to begin a dialogue with the enemy, knowing that his objective is our destruction?
What do his reasons, his ways, matter to us, unless to know him better and to destroy his intentions by destroying him?
Are we ready, the people, the workers, the Peronists, to accept a law that brings us directly to slavery?
I think that we, the descendants of the ones who lived and fought with San Martin,
Quiroga, Penalozza and Varela, won't ban them from our memories, we won't refuse the mandate of so many sacrifices.
Your comrade J.M.
IMPUNITY
When the people are excluded from political power, the crimes of neocolonialism achieve total impunity, they are the law.
The system becomes the only and absolute beholder of violence.
Violence invades the streets, enters homes, and the people's minds.
And if man resists, he will be hit or killed.
If he gives in, he isn't a man anymore.
The system's violence is used for silencing and terrorizing.
It tries to reduce man to a passive thing, one who doesn't make history.
It tries to make him an object who suffers from history.
The violence of the system isn't really the repression itself, but the fear of it.
The fear of every man of being pursued, marginalized, the fear of committing those acts that will permit him to regain his humanity.
''There will be reactionary violence until it can be defeated by revolutionary violence, or dictatorship of the privileged or national liberation'' J.W. Cooke
THE EXECUTIONS OF JUNE 16TH 1956
A military faction, of nationalist-catholic tendencies, revolts against the "gorilla revolution".
Agents of repression, alarmed by the commotion, wait for the rioters and smother them.
That night, in the waste site of Leon Suarez, they shoot several prisoners, guilty or not.
Comrade Troxler is one of them.
I am Julio Troxler, one of those who were driven here, at dawn, June 10, to be shot.
I was lucky, thanks to a truck accident and in the dark of the night,
I left unharmed.
How did you feel about that experience?
Nobody would have imagined what followed.
We thought they would take us to prison because we wanted to march at the Plaza de Mayo, to cheer for Perón and the triumph of the revolution.
We thought, at worst, to be locked up a couple of days.
But when we arrived here, and they let us get out of the truck turning the lights on our backs,
I started to understand that things would turn out badly.
And suddenly the first shot was fired, at the same time as the accident.
So... the desire to survive... and the total chaos...
...provoking the death of five comrades and one wounded...
...and the escape of many of us, which wasn't easy.
And what did you do after the executions?
I waited there, very near, until the truck and the car following it were gone.
I went back to the place to see if there were some people alive, or wounded. Nothing of that, they were all dead, assassinated.
The police had left them on the road.
Carlos Lizazo and the three others,
...four bodies full of bullets...
...on the road that led to the German Club.
Have you been in prison since the executions?
I was a prisoner in November 1957... because someone turned me in.
They brought me to the
Investigation Brigade of San Martin.
And there... I was tortured, just as I was by the Lanus brigade.
The agents of the judicial system participated in the tortures and orgies, like Judge Biglione, and military men like Suarez, the Secretary General, San Emeterio, and several police officers.
In what way did they torture you?
After being undressed and blindfolded, so I couldn't see the torturers, they attached you to the table by your ankles and wrists.
Then the electric shocks began, real orgies for those men keeping themselves busy with your genitals.
Mine were covered with blood in the end, my mouth was also covered with blood.
Of course, this is not a pleasant thing to tell, but living through it is even worse.
What matters to me is to be understood. I was a common citizen... who, only for defending an ideal and the Constitution, has been subjected to such treatment.
Troxler, do you have anything to add?
Sure, despite the executions, and all the tortures,
I have to say that we, the Peronists, will continue this battle until the end.
In that way, we are in solidarity with our Latin American,
Asian, and African friends.
These last groups are already seeing the results of the process of liberation from imperialism.
And we too, if we persevere, we will succeed.
For this, we must follow the example from Asian and African countries and apply it successfully.
Vietnam, for example, where a small group of men are fighting against the most powerful army in the world.
We know that we'll succeed, and we'll leave a better world for our children.
THE DUTY OF THE INTELLECTUAL
My friends...
The revolution won't begin until we have killed the old colonized man who still slumbers in us.
Before everything else, it begins with us.
It won't be defined until we take risks, not with words or ideas, but with accomplished acts.
The worker who strikes, and risks his work and existence.
The student who puts his career at stake.
The militant they torture.
And many examples that could keep us from something more important than a vague gesture of solidarity.
What is commonly understood by solidarity is just a form of piteous charity and satisfies more those who give than those who receive it.
''We shouldn't only desire the triumph of the victims'', said Guevara,
''but join it to its destiny in death, and victory''.
In Latin America, there's no room for either passivity or innocence.
Our duty as national intellectuals is different from that of other intellectuals in the big cities.
We can't devote ourselves to universal culture while there's a more important problem to be solved: national liberation!
Every action not essential to the liberation, far from criticizing the system, leave it to the others.
The regime involves in its crimes all those who don't fight them directly.
We should work in order to liberate this continent, this country, the Latin American man, every one of us, or else you're on the enemy's side.
There won't be any choices in between.
Your comrade, A.M.
If daily violence weren't enough, the system seeks more explicit and unforgivable forms to maintain its peace, its order, its norms.
THE VICTIMS
In their battle for liberation, our people have had many martyrs.
In recent years, hundreds of militants have been killed.
The victims of June 16th, 1955...
Those of the executions in 1956...
The fighters from Salta... those from the massive protests.
Some, engraved anonymously...
Others, raised by the people, like flags...
Some names...
Musy, Retamar, Mendoza,
Isla de Molina, Santiago, Pontillon,
Felipe Vallesse, the greatest symbol of this violence.
'We, above everyone else, have to understand this dehumanization process.
More than anyone else, we have to know the costs involved in regaining our humanity.''
S. Carmichael
THE ANONYMOUS MARTYRS
June 16th 1955, the planes of the "gorillas" terrorize the streets of Buenos Aires.
Torture at the individual level, or mass murder, are the natural consequences of violence on a daily basis.
They don't deny it, on the contrary, they affirm it.
This is its most revealing synthesis.
The system maintains its power only by violence...
''It is impossible to understand neocolonialism'' Fanon said,
''without its need to rape, to destroy, to kill''.
But the violence of the system is also its self-destruction.
To dehumanize the people, the system dehumanizes itself first.
By using extreme violence, the system is the first to agonize.
''The only ones that have the right to use violence are the people who want to free themselves.
This violence, in the people's hands, is not violence, it's justice.'' Perón.
ACTION AND REVOLUTION
"Prepare yourself to fight...
Prepare your rifle...
Prepare your body for the battle".
A comrade of the
Uruguayan movement, Tupamaro, tells in a documentary:
We start from the principle that revolutionary action itself, the act to arm yourself, to be prepared, to accept to act against the bourgeois order, implies conscience, organization and revolutionary conditions.
In countries like Cuba, the principles at the base of a socialist revolution are present, confirmed, without discussion.
It takes little to show the way to revolt and to apply it.
It's the armed battle that accelerates mass movement.
In Cuba and in China, the party of the masses was born during combat.
CREATE MANY VIETNAMS!
A former Peruvian metal worker told us that the only way to free ourselves from imperialism, is, as Che thought, to attack their colonial territories and force them to diversify their armed forces.
The order to ''create two, three, many Vietnams'' summarizes the last hope for humanity today.
The Pentagon and its footmen will face a serious dilemma: either they observe and don't interfere with the Latin American revolution, or they intervene by military force as happened in Cuba or the Dominican Republic.
We have to unite and prepare for the colonial war.
The guerrillas of Venezuela, of Colombia and Guatemala, the mobilization of the workers, peasants and students, are the beginning of the epic struggle that this continent will go through.
Latin America, as Che said, will be the
Vietnam of the next decade.
PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE?
The Revolutionary Peronist Front is showing its solidarity with the Vietnamese people and declares:
Peaceful coexistence is just opium that permits imperialism to exploit humanity with impunity.
There can't be peaceful coexistence with the deadly aggressiveness of the
Yankee system's monopoly, whose most characteristic trait is the support for war and crime.
For us, the people of the Third World, who hope to end the underdevelopment, poverty and the exploitation, the only way is revolutionary war, the fight to death against the imperialist oppressor and the fight for eternal peace in the world.
But we have to underline that the enemy ran away from several crime scenes, not because he was on the winning side, but on the contrary, because he lost against popular movements.
They've been defeated at the Bay of Pigs and they'll be defeated in Vietnam.
If 500,000 Marines, the elite of the American army, couldn't defeat the small heroic people of Vietnam, how many millions will they need to face and fight against more than two thirds of humanity,
700 million Chinese, the Cubans, the Koreans, the
Latin Americans, the socialist countries, the Africans, the Arabs, the African-Americans and the progressive forces of the industrialized countries?
Imperialism has no chance at all.
They only have nuclear blackmail.
As Mao said, ''It's a paper tiger.''
"MILITANT INTERNATIONALISM"
Fidel Castro said it clearly:
''The theory that says that if this generation doesn't win the war, the next one will, is a defeatist, inhumane and cowardly theory.
The Marxist-Leninist and internationalist principle wants us to fight not until the last citizen of the oppressed country, but until the last citizen of the socialist camp.
The militant solidarity of the Latin American people was shown in the epic revolutions of
Bolivar, San Martin and Sucre.''
HYPOTHESIS FOR THE LIBERATION
Finally, we could say that the liberation of every country is always a unique event, an invention.
Cuba is probably the best example for us, Argentines and Latin Americans.
The Cuban revolution has proved that a people can liberate itself if its revolutionary chiefs, its elite, take part in the history of the people.
Cuba, Vietnam and other people of the third world showed that no national revolution would be possible if not accompanied by a social revolution.
In other words, today more than ever, the nationalism of the first independence integrates the socialism of the second one and the quest to an internationalism that allows for the total destruction of imperialism.
ARGENTINA TODAY
As the authors of these comments, we repeat what we showed in the film's first part.
Argentina and most of the countries of this continent are living in a war that hides itself behind a pseudo-normality and pseudo-peace, a war that reveals itself in daily violence, indeed, four persons die every minute in Latin America, or two million every year.
The essential is to notice this state of war and to get on each path to test all hypotheses, with revolutionary energy and deeds.
In short: invent our own revolution.
The protagonists of this quest are all of us. But, even more, it's you.
You, who have the possibility to discuss these images are also, through your daily actions, the only way to develop this unsolved problem.
The film and its content stay open for other comments, testimonies and letters on violence and liberation.
To all who collaborated in the realization of this film, peasants, workers, students, intellectuals and revolutionary militants, we express our gratitude.

- Make sure her nightgown is down.
Give me help with her hands, Maurice.
Put her elbows down, please.
And make sure her nightgown is down and okay.
Lift her head up.
# So don't play with me
'cause you're playing with fire #
- Is her nightgown down?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Now it's morning time, Carol.
[Child Coughing]
And everything's the same this morning as it was yesterday, except for your night.
People are getting up and getting dressed and washed and having breakfast.
Now, if they've had bad dreams, they should tell me.
You should tell me, so you don't go carrying them into the daytime with you.
- [Man] Terry?
- 'Cause they sure don't make it easy for you to get up.
- Terry?
- Right here, Walter.
I wonder if you could give Maurice a hand so I can make breakfast.
Let me slide her a bit this way.
- Okay?
- Yep.
[Terry]
Thanks.
[Walter]
Okay. That's fine.
[Terry]
Carol's been having really hard nights lately.
It's like she gets so scared sometimes that she thinks she hears voices.
Okay, Tony?
- All right, Carol.
- What would you like for breakfast?
[Terry] Breakfast time for all who want breakfast!
That's okay, Maurice.
I'll call you if I need you.
How are you doing?
Eh? How are you doing?
How are you doing?
Eh?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
Eh? Doing pretty bad, huh?
- Huh?
- No!
No?
Terry says-- From what Terry says, it sounds pretty--
Sounds intense.
[Sighs]
You know what I think you need is to come and sit in the sunshine, have some breakfast.
What would you like for breakfast, hmm?
Terry?
Terry?
- It's all right. It's all right.
- [Footsteps Approaching]
- Yeah?
- What does, uh--
What does Carol like for breakfast?
- [Carol] Nothing.
- Oh, usually a toasted tomato sandwich.
No, I don't! I haven't had that in a dog's age!
- In a dog's age?
- And I won't start eating it now. No.
- No? What would you like?
- I don't want anything. I'm not hungry.
So let's see.
One of the food she likes is tomatoes and--
[Carol]
I'm not going to have that.
- Tomato and lettuce sandwiches.
- I don't feel like it, Walter!
- Well, okay. What do you feel like?
- How about Cheerios?
No, I don't feel like that neither!
I don't feel like anything!
What would you like?
- She had a bad night.
- [Coughs] She must have had a bad night.
- Now she's saying she won't go to school.
- She goes to school.
Yeah. Okay. Do you want to help me?
No, I'm taking kids to school, but I'll help you as soon as I get back.
Of course she goes to school.
There's no question about it.
Okay. So when are you leaving?
- Immediately.
- Okay.
If you'd just tell her she's going to school, settle it now... then you won't have the issue later on.
- [Tony, Indistinct]
- Terry?
- Yeah?
- You know what I think?
I think you're afraid to give her a good blast, you know.
She needs to sound off this morning.
[Tony] You need to blast yourself
'cause you haven't got your coat hanged up yet.
- Would you not interfere, Tony?
- I will. You're not hanging up your coat.
- Susan. Susan?
- [Children Chattering]
I'm just going over to get the kids from the other school.
Bye, Debbie! I'd like to hear why you called me that name.
What's a fig wart look like?
I haven't even said good morning to you this morning. Isn't that right?
And isn't that why you were following me downstairs? Eh?
Is that why you were interfering?
I had the nerve not to say hello to you on my own.
- No.
- I think that's why. Eh?
- No.
- Yeah. Good morning.
- Well--
- Tomorrow it's school for you, eh?
[Children Chattering]
[Carol]
Don't look at me!
What are you-- What are you doing?
Keeping yourself warm there?
- Yeah.
- Where's your housecoat?
Uh, it's upstairs, I guess.
How about you hustle up and get your housecoat, eh?
All right.
I want you to be there ready for school tomorrow.
- I'm gonna be ready for school.
- Yeah, keep yourself warm and looked-after.
- Terry? Terry?
- And I slept under my blanket.
- Freddie should have his housecoat on.
- Pardon?
Freddie should have his housecoat on.
[Terry]
All right. Put on your housecoat.
Good-bye, Tony, Tony, Tony.
Say, you'd better make arrangements about my bike.
- I will.
- Okay.
- [All Chattering]
- [Tony Shouting]
- Hey!
- What?
[Tony Shouting]
- [Children Chattering]
- [Boy] Alvyn?
- Was Carol held this morning?
- [Terry] Yeah.
- Who held her?
- Maurice and I.
- Did you hold her at the point that she hit you?
- No.
Why-- Why did you hold her?
- Why did I hold her?
- Mm-hmm.
Because as I continued to try and get her out of bed, I realized I couldn't do it... without physically lifting her, and I knew she'd blow if I did.
[Walter] If you had called me,
I could have got her out without anything.
You know that.
- Why do you say that?
- 'Cause I know it.
You mean, once she had allowed her to be hit and so forth... she was engaged in a physical way?
What do you mean?
I just think a process-- a whole process goes on between Terry and Carol--
- Yes, that's true.
- That if I came into the house...
I could get Carol out ofbed without touching her.
Well, let me ask you a simple question.
Why did you hold her this morning?
Because I felt if I tried to get her out ofbed, then she'd blow.
And she'd have to be contained.
What did you want from her?
What was your objective?
- To get her mobilized.
- To get her mobilized?
And you thought holding her would mobilize her?
It wasn't a holding holding.
It wasn't to push through and find out what her dream was... or to find out what was on her mind.
- What was it?
- It was just to get her out of bed without hurting anybody.
Hold to get the kid out of bed?
- Well, we lifted her out of bed, and she was flinging her arms around, so we held her.
- I see.
Contained her so you could physically move her out of the bed.
I don't understand a holding session to get a kid out of bed.
You can hold to contain a child when a child is losing control.
For the kid's safety, you have to interfere and provide the structure and security.
You can hold a child to permit the child to ventilate.
She has something in her that has to be expressed... and it'll be acted out in gross behavior that is harmful to her or to somebody else... and you hold her so that she can be contained during the period... that she ventilates this material.
But if you want to get somebody out of bed... you have to find a way to engage them...
and allow them to make the-- get their motors running so that they can function.
Now, through a holding, where there's ventilation... you can get communication, very important communication.
Through a holding that's a containment...
you can get a very good communication.
But I don't think if you're picking a kid out of bed... and she's fighting you... that this is going to give you very much in the way of communication.
You can imagine the difference it makes to a kid... say, who is just, uh, beginning to develop, uh, ego control... if you can, by talking, manage to help him contain himself... rather than if you move into a holding session too quickly... and by doing that, undermine his own self-confidence.
Here is a kid who is ready to handle-- by verbal signals, by other devices...
by the manipulation of him in the group and so forth-- a problem that you don't give him an opportunity to demonstrate his capacity to handle.
You rob him of the chance to experience his own growing strength...
and this is the danger in, uh-- in, uh, precipitous holding.
- Oh, she called you--
- You called me a cheat?
- [Girl] She called first.
- There you go.
Two! Oh.
My turn. Two sevens.
- Uh--
- Two aces.
Oh, you're a cheater! Cheater! Cheater!
Here, take 'em all. Cheater.
- Ooh. Cheater, honestly.
- [Carol] What did he do?
- He threw them right by me.
- You must have X-ray vision.
- [Boy] I don't believe that I cheat.
- [Carol] You cheat.
- Would you--
- I don't even know where I'm gonna put them.
[Carol] Okay, now you're going to be sorry.
The whole god-darn lot of you, for sure.
Cheat! One, two, three.
- [Tony Shouting]
- Two jacks.
Two jacks. That's right.
- [Carol] He's been goofing up all day today.
- [Shouting]
I'll punch your nose in!
Fuck off. Asshole.
- He's been goofing all day today.
- You fuck off. You fuck off.
- What's that got to do-- Eh?
- You fuck off.
- What's that got to do with it?
- You fuck off.
- What's that got to do with it?
- Let go of me, or I'll punch your fuckin'--
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Just let go of me!
- Eh?
- Fuck off.
- Sure will.
- [Terry] It's all right.
You fuck off.
Eh?
[Terry] Let's put Tony on the floor.
That's the best place for him.
Well, then this is gonna be more funner.
[Robyn]
Is this your idea of fun, Tony? Eh?
[Girl]
I suppose you like doing that, eh, Tony?
Yeah, you really enjoy this, Tony. Do you?
[Terry] I want to know exactly what's on your mind, and I want you to deal with it.
Ow! You fuck off. My fuckin' back, lady.
[Terry] What's the trouble?
You know exactly what the trouble is.
- [Spits]
- You know what it is.
- Don't you get your fuckin' breath near me.
- [Carol] Fuck everybody! That's my pop!
Why not, Tony? Eh?
Why not?
- Why don't you want my breath--
- Your breath!
What about my breath?
What about my breath?
- [Shouts]
- What about her breath, Tony?
- What about my breath, Tony? Hmm?
- [Tony Groans]
[Robyn]
Why don't you like my breath, hmm?
[Tony Whimpering]
We're interested in you right now and how come you're so scared... over someone's breathing and not in anything else.
I'm itching!
You know, what else is bothering you besides the itch, Tony? Eh?
- How come my breath bothers you, eh?
- Ow! [Crying]
How come my breath bothers you, Tony? Eh?
- Fuck off!
- How come my breath--
Fuck off.
- Tony, why does Robyn's breath scare you?
- Fuck off!
- Fuck off.
- Why, Tony?
It smells awful!
Why is that, Tony? Eh?
No, don't pull it away. Don't pull it.
It's okay. He's not hurting me.
Fuck off!
[Shouting]
[Terry, Indistinct]
- Over here?
- [Tony Crying]
Okay.
- Yeah?
- You fuck off!
Freddie, fuck off.
[Robyn] You tell us exactly what it is, Tony.
Just exactly what it is.
- [Groans] I itch!
- Well, that's not it.
You know, I don't care about your itch, Tony!
All I care about is what's making you feel so miserable!
That's what I want to hear about!
I don't want to hear about your leg, and I don't want to hear about your arm... and I don't want to hear about your itch, or I don't want to hear about the way
Susan's holding your head!
I want to hear about what's really bothering you, Tony!
And I want to hear about why you're so scared of my bad breath.
- That's what I want to know.
- 'Cause it smells awful!
Well, why does that bother you so much?
What does it remind you of?
- You want me to help you bring his arm over?
- Yeah.
Robyn, you know that kid should be handled properly.
You just turn him right around and get him underneath where Susan is.
- Right? Come right around.
- I hate you people! You fuck off!
You're all right, Tony. You're okay.
- They hurt me bad!
- Nobody's hurting you.
- Yeah, the kids do!
- Nobody's hurting you.
Kids don't hurt you. They're helping you.
Kids are helping you, and you know it.
Why do you act as if they're hurting you?
Let me turn him this way.
- I don't feel good this way!
- You're all right.
- [Tony Shouts]
- You're all right. You're okay.
[Robyn]
It's what's inside that's hurting you.
Because the kids put my head back.
[Walter]
They're just, uh, helping you. You know?
Yeah, well, when I got my funny teeth and Robyn's kidding they don't quite go up--
[Indistinct]
She won't hurt you, Tony.
[Walter] I'm very pleased to see the kids jump in and help you.
You're all right.
If staff don't brush their teeth, it's all right.
- [Girl] Can I shut that window?
It's getting cold in here.
- [Walter] So what are you saying that about?
- Okay, then you shut it.
- Well, their breath smells when they don't brush.
- Why does that bother you?
- So why does that bother you?
It breathes into me every time
I have to take a breath in.
- [Boy] Robyn doesn't smoke.
- You know, it smells.
You think their bad breath is gonna hurt you?
- Yes, it does hurt!
- How?
- Why does it hurt you?
- Whenever I take a breath in, you know-- it smells awful!
I think it's fire or something.
You think it's gonna hurt your insides?
It's fire, and they yelled at me.
[Walter] Imagine thinking people are breathing fire into you.
That's a pretty awful thing to think.
It must be very frightening.
Nobody's gonna breathe fire into you, Tony.
[Robyn] Nobody at all.
[Walter]
These are just natural smells that people have.
[Radio: Man Singing Pop Ballad]
# And stars that fell #
- It can never hurt your insides.
- # Like the rain #
- Hmm?
# Out of the blue #
Did someone tell you about having fire breathed into you, Tony?
# And the angels ask me to recall #
[Robyn]
Nobody's going to breathe fire into you, Tony.
# The thrill of them all #
# Then I will tell them #
# I remember you #
# Ooh ##
- [Man] Keep out of all houses!
- Why?
What do you mean why?
You're not supposed to go inside.
You'll get hurt.
Okay, he said keep out of all houses.
- It's for your own good.
- All houses, guys.
- Correct! Hundred percent.
- He said houses.
- Yeah.
Okay, let's go, Dalashell!
What are you waitin' for?
- How much do you want to?
- A hundred by ones.
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Thirty!
- Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
- See you, kid.
- Cut it out!
Forty!
- Oh, please help me up.
- Okay, here.
[Screams]
[Shouting]
Robert! You're gonna get it!
You're gonna get it, Robert!
Five, six, seven, eight, nine!
One hundred!
Give me your hands.
Not this again.
- Come on! Come on!
- [Children Laughing]
- My hands are dirty.
- Ah, you son of a--
[Boy Grunts, Chatters]
[Boy Chatters]
Am I dirty or am I dirty?
[Indistinct]
- God.
- [Boy] Bye-bye.
I wasn't in that house, you know.
[Boy]
Neither was I.
- [Dalashell] What do you mean, you weren't in the house?
- I wasn't.
- What do you mean telling me you weren't in that house?
- I wasn't.
- I saw you!
- You didn't.
- I closed the door, and I watched.
You left the house.
- Sorry.
And I saw you, I saw Douglas,
I saw Judy go out of that house!
I saw you go out of it!
- I wasn't in there!
- So don't give me any of that.
And you knew I was there.
[Boy] I'm not gonna push you down there anymore.
[Boy]
Come on, Doug! There's Maurice.
[Laughing]
That's good?
[Man]
A very fine cap you have there, Tony.
[Carol]
See what you made me did, you slob?
You made me cross them out.
Cross out what you didn't want to write in the first place?
- [Chuckles]
- Huh?
No. It's what I wanted to write, but I got mad, so I crossed it out.
Uh-huh.
- Can we dictate this letter which you wanted before?
- No. No.
- Not yet. Not yet.
- No.
- I see.
- Terry.
- I'm not gonna just sit here--
- Let's see what we can do.
[Terry, Indistinct]
- Where did you come from, Tony?
- Sacred Heart.
I beg your pardon?
Sacred Heart Village? I see.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
How did you get along in Sacred Heart Village?
- What?
- How did you get along there?
Fine. I don't want to go back there.
- You don't want to go back there?
- I want to go back there.
- You want to go back there. I see.
- [Terry] Would you say that without smiling, please?
- Uh-huh.
- Can you?
Uh-huh.
What is it-- What is it that you liked about Sacred Heart Village?
There were a lot more comfortable things.
You know, you can ride your bike out-- out on the streets.
- Yes.
- And they, you know, let you walk out on the streets.
- You can walk out on the streets, ride your bike on the streets, yes?
- Mm-hmm.
Could you tell us all the things you don't like about Warrendale?
They don't allow you to go out on the street, like Sacred Heart--
- Yes.
- Or ride your bike out on the streets or anything.
- Yes.
- And you can't ever go out unless they allow you.
I see. Anything else? Surely there must be other things that you dislike.
Hmm? Do people like you here in Warrendale, Tony?
- Nope.
- Mm-hmm.
[Terry] Tony Duplessis.
Say that again without smiling, please.
- Uh-huh.
- You'd better hide that big grin behind your hat. It's such a big one.
- Uh-huh.
- [Indistinct]
[Terry]
Pardon? What do you mean?
- Say that without smiling.
- Huh?
I have a feeling-- I have a feeling that many people like you very much, Tony.
- Well, I'll tell you who only likes me.
- Who likes you then?
Douglas Giraud from House One.
That's the only person.
- The only person who likes you.
- Uh-huh.
The only one. Just one.
Anybody else?
- No?
- Yep.
Tony? You deserve to stay here.
Huh? Tony--
No, you've got to for me and for Robert and for--
- You deserve to stay here.
- Robert who?
Robyn and Dr. Fischer too. Everybody.
- Carol, do you feel that Tony deserves to stay here?
- Yes.
- Of course he does.
- No, I don't, Carol!
- Yeah, that makes it unanimous.
- I think we all agree that he deserves to stay here.
- Wouldn't you think so?
- I don't think--
He's trying to tell us all the time, you know, that he wants to go back to Sacred Heart...
because he feels-- he feels that he does not deserve to stay here...
but he does, and he deserves--
- Well, I'll tell you one thing right now.
- Yes.
If I want to take off, I'll take off.
No one can stop me.
- Uh-huh. We will. We will.
- People want you right here, Tony.
- That's right.
- Oh.
You know, what is Terry going to do without you on her lap for such a long time?
- Oh!
- That's right.
Dr. Fischer, that means you know what!
Shall we take another look at the letter to Mum and Dad?
Sure.
- It's a nice letter.
- It's a nice letter, huh?
Yeah. "Dear Mum and Dad, I received your letter last week and was very disappoint--
"I mean, very glad to hear from you.
"It seems that everyone is getting a cold.
How are you now?
"Hope you are feeling a lot better.
I'm feeling a lot better now and I'm back in my diving.
"I really don't know if I'm still gonna be in the competitions on the 26th.
It's really my choice."
I see.
Now, shall we dictate another letter?
You dictate it, and I'll write it down.
Uh-huh. Come on. Let me hear it.
Dear Mum and Dad, hi.
Hope this letter-
- Come on.
- Finds you well.
- Finds you what?
- Well. Oh, uh! I don't know.
- Finds you what?
- Well!
- Well? You have to say--
- Rotten!
No, well.
You don't tell me whether I--
- [Terry] Is that "rotten" that I heard?
- Rotten, yes. Go on.
No. Well! I love my parents.
Yes. Go on.
Repeat after me three times--
- I love my parents.
- Ooh, I love my parents.
- I love my parents.
- I love my parents.
- I love my parents.
- I hate my-- I love my parents.
Uh-huh. Let's have the letter now.
I would like this letter dictated before we put it away.
- Huh?
- Okay. Here. You dictate it.
Well, I would like you to dictate it without writing it... because we don't want it written down, do we?
- Oh, you mean a real nasty letter.
- Oh, a nasty letter?
Well, this is a letter that we will really send.
What will be the letter? Go on.
Dear stupids.
- Dear stupids. Yes?
- Oh, shorthand. Yeah.
Yes, go on.
- I would love to see you dead.
- Yes?
- [Laughing]
- I would love to see you dead.
- I fooled you there.
- [Terry] That's good and honest!
- It is not!
- Yes, you almost-- You almost fooled me.
- You almost fooled me.
- Um--
I hope you are feeling pretty rotten.
Yes? Go on.
What would you like to tell them about the swimming competition?
- Oh, is that all you want to know?
- Yes. Go on.
- Go ahead. That's a good start.
- Go ahead. Is that--
- No. No.
- Is that all you want me to do... in order to recognize that I'm in existence?
Huh?
No, because they'd write, "Sure it is".
Are you just going to like me... if--
Yeah. If...
I--
- Win.
- If I win-- Underline.
- Win--
- Underline three times.
In the competitions?
Um, that's supposed to be competitions.
- Yes.
- Very well expressed.
Seems you are wiping them out all the time.
- No, I'm underlining 'em.
- You're underlining it.
- I see. I see.
- If--
If.
- Wait. If I--
- Yes?
- Win-- win the competitions.
- Yes.
I see. This looks like a much more honest letter.
The official letter we will send away, okay?
Fold it and send it away to the garbage place.
- [Terry] Okay.
- Now, where's the other thing?
This is too precious to send to the garbage.
These are your feelings. You know that?
Oh, they can be thrown away.
Look at what you did!
Do you know that these feelings are very precious?
They will go straight into our file.
- They will not!
- Yes.
No! Dr. Fischer!
Dr. Fischer, you're going off your bloody nut!
Well, I might. I might. But, uh--
Now, you unfold it properly and give it to me.
Walter!
Do you want to take the other arm, please?
- [Shouts]
- [Walter] She can come on her own.
She can come on her own!
- Let me go upstairs for one minute.
- Come on.
Can I go upstairs for one minute?

- You're not eating.
Hey. Tony, you don't grab the food with your damn hands!
Sit up, dear.
Yeah, is that all you say to him when he picks the damn butter up with his hands...
and throws it back on the dish?
[Walter] You shouldn't be giving him so much attention.
[Boy] Where's that man hiding?
Where's he filming us from?
- That's not it, so don't worry.
- [Irene] Allan King!
Too bad! You hit me!
You're asking for it, you bugger.
[Carol]
I don't like people throwing food at me!
There's your bottle, Davey.
You can have it.
Come on.
Quiet time.
It's time for Davey Engels to go to sleep.
Shut up.
- Tony, you don't belong in here now.
It's Davey's bedtime.
- Hi, Millie!
- It's Davey's bedtime.
- Hi!
[Chattering]
- Terry!
- Hi, Millie.
I wanna skip, Millie. I wanna skip.
Can you please get Tony from here?
He's disrupting, uh, Davey's bedtime.
Bullshit! Bullshit!
## [Tony Vocalizing]
He's interfering with Davey's bedtime.
I won't go. I won't go!
I won't go. I won't go. I won't go.
I won't go. I won't go.
[Whispering]
I won't go. I won't go.
I won't go. I won't go.
I won't go. I won't go.
No, I--
No.
I won't go to sleep.
What would you like for breakfast?
- [Boy] Pop. Pop.
- The same goes for you.
- I'll do it with a milk can.
- No, no.
Let-- Terry, I wanted to stop it.
Well, you don't drink it in the first place.
You don't play games with your cup!
There. Now you can have it.
And you don't play games with your cup either.
- I play games with my spoon.
- Stop it. You don't swing it around.
We've got enough things broken in our house, Tony.
We don't have to break our cups too.
- Well, how come he gets to--
- [Freddie] I want that.
[Tony] No!
- [Children Chattering]
- [Can Clattering]
[Tony]
How does Bob rate?
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Staff, Children Chattering]
- No cheating in this game, boy.
- No.
You put it back right up there.
Okay, let's start over again.
- No, it was--
- Cheaters have to start over again.
- What are you doing at school?
- [Indistinct]
So put your hands like that.
- Come on, we'll have a game of cards.
- I don't have no cards.
- Put them straight like that.
- [Boy] I'm doing it.
This is gonna be a game--
This is a game like cards. Like cards.
- Like that. Like that.
- Yeah? Right there.
Put 'em like that, right down the bottom of there.
- Down at the bottom. Okay?
- [Freddie] Get out of this room.
Get out of this room.
Patrick, get out of the room.
Get out of the rooml
That was a dirty trick.
[Freddie] Hey, Tony, how about getting down from that, uh, cupboard?
[Girl] Bob!
You were supposed to get the lights and the cigarettes.
- You go and get it--
- Terry was supposed to go out and get it.
- [Tony] You fuckin'don't do this!
- Tony, hurry up and get down.
Come on, you're getting right down, Tony.
You can get down yourself.
- You're all right.
- Hey! You're not supposed to do this.
- You're all right, Tony!
- You fuck off!
- You fuck off!
- [Freddie] Tony, just hit the ladder.
- You fuck off.
- Get down.
- I'll get down when I'm ready.
- You get down now!
You fuck off! You fuck off.
You fuck off. You fuck off.
Oh, my God!
He fuckin' shoved me down to the edge!
- Oh, all right. You're right here now.
- [Shouting, Indistinct]
Can you come down by the ladder?
I sure as hell can, if he moves his big fat rear end!
Ah, where do you want Maurice to sit?
- He can go right over to the other end!
- [Irene] Terry, he always jumps.
- Bullshit. Bullshit.
- What's that smile about, Tony Duplessis?
Come on down. Come on.
Your story is waiting for you, and I'm waiting for you too. Let's go.
I'll go right there if he lets go of me.
No, you don't go up. You come down.
Let's go.
- Don't--
- [Freddie] Whoal
I'll-- I'll jump right in the middle of--
- Fine. Good. Jump.
- Yeah! I'll jump.
- Come on, let's go.
- Fuck off! You're gonna--
Come on, Tony.
You're coming right down now.
Don't you-- You fuck off.
Come on.
You fuckin'jack-off.
[Maurice]
It's your bedtime.
- There's not time for anything else but this.
- Terry! Terry.
Just pull your hair out of the way.
It's gonna hurt. He's got a whole gob.
[Tony Babbling]
How's big fat Santa Claus?
- [Terry] And how's little Tony, huh?
- Uh-huh.
And how is you, Maurice?
Poor little hair.
[Man]
Give me your glasses.
Tony, come on. Let go.
I don't wanna--
No.
- Fuck off, Bowmanville.
- Tony, just let go.
- Staff can handle it.
- Oh, sorry, Terry.
- Fuck off.
- Don't interfere, please.
Come on, Tony.
[Tony Laughing]
Tony, you just cut it out!
[Irene]
Tony, let go.
That's fine.
[Tony Laughing]
Fuck off!
What are you doing here, you fucking asshole?
- Hey.
- Fuck off.
- This is your bed, where you ought to be at this time.
- Fuck off.
Tony, you can't be climbing up on that closet.
- Well, I'll choose my own fuckin' bed.
- What are you doing up there?
"Finally he came to a concrete highway and started up the middle of it... and all the other creatures followed him."
- Robert, what are you doing?
- Drinking milk.
- I want you under your covers.
- Uh-uh.
- Come on.
- Uh-uh.
- It's quiet time.
- Come on.
- I want you lying down and ready for bed.
- It's not time.
- Right now, Bob.
- Well, lie down.
Come on. You're holding us up.
You're holding the story up.
- [Robert, Indistinct]
- Hey, this is a good book.
Come on, you don't read this when there's a story being read.
Yes, I can. I'm listening to the story.
I think I'll read my chapter book too.
Cut it out, Bob.
- Well, you don't take my book away from me.
- Come on.
I can read it. I'm listening to you.
"Finally, a boy about Bartholomew's age entered the room.
"He was the king's nephew.
"'What's the matter, UncleJohn? ' he inquired when he saw the angry king.
"'This boy will not take off his hat', the king replied.
"'Nonsense, nonsense', said the king's nephew, whose name was Grand Duke Wilfred.
"'I'll take care of him.
Send him out to the yard with me.'
- "'All right', said the king.
- Oh, yeah.
"And the two boys went right to the yard.
"The grand duke looked at Bartholomew and laughed meanly.
"'Stand over there, against that wall, ' he ordered.
"'I need a little practice with my bow and arrow.
"The grand duke shot one arrow after another until he had no arrows left.
[Carol]
Somebody's taken the fuckin'shampoo!
Dozens of hats had been shot off, but still Bartholomew's head was not bare."
There's some shampoo in the other bathroom in the closet!
- [Laughing]
- Come on, Bob.
You put that in your drawer, and you too, Robert.
Maurice? Maurice? Screw a pig.
- Come on.
- Screw a pig.
It's quiet time.
I want you to lie down and be quiet.
- [Robert Chattering]
- You're not gonna get it.
Come on.
I'm not playing games with you, Bob.
Don't you want to wear your pajama top, Tony?
You gonna be warm enough?
Okay, I'll wear it.
I want more.
Here.
- I want more.
- More?
No. I think three helpings for one night--
I only had two.
- You had one at the table. Here.
- One there. One here.
One at the table. One just before.
And this is the third one.
Terry, no, it wasn't, because--
One when you were at snack, and the second one when--
Uh, mine was brung up here.
Oh, I see. Okay. Then you had two.
[Male Announcer On Radio, Indistinct]
[Man On Radio] The two of you are standing there on Main Street.
- [Coughing]
- [Radio Continues, Indistinct]
[Sniffles, Moans]
[Person Coughing]
And the princess whispered,
"You can climb up by using my hair".
And at first, the man, even though he was little... said, "No, I can't do that. I'll hurt you.
Your hair isn't strong enough".
And she said, "You don't realize the strength of a woman".
And he said, "All right.
If you think you can do it, then I'll try".
And he started to climb--
- And climb.
- And climb.
Climb.
And he twisted great chunks of her hair in his hands... and he wrapped both his feet around her hair, as if it was rope... and he climbed all of the way up... and she was able to support him with her head.
And he got into the castle... and he gave the king the secret weapon that he had.
And the next morning, the king used it.
Oh.
Good night.
[Kisses]
Good dreams. And tell Walter to come down and say good night to me, okay?
Yes, I will.
[Door Closes]
Oh.
These have got to be washed.
[Woman]
Just leave them at the front door.
- [Indistinct]
- [Woman, Indistinct]
- Have you checked who's downstairs?
- What that?
One of the camera--
The cameraman is--
We will. Okay.
- [Terry] What?
- That's all right.
[Maurice, Indistinct]
[Terry]
Yeah.
[Children Chattering]
[Boy] Come on! I'm cold!
[Hammering]
- [Tony, Mock Shivering]
- [Maurice, Indistinct]
- You guys ready?
- Yep.
[Maurice]
The blue station wagon.
- Green light!
- [Hammering]
Red light! Stop, Maurice and Kevin.
Okay. You ready?
Back, Patrick and Davey Engels!
Green light.
Red light. Back, Maurice and Kevin Rainer behind Jim Skinner.
Green light.
Red light.
I can see the reflection in those glasses.
Green light.
Red light.
Back, Jim and Kevin and Danny.
- [Danny] You never saw me!
- Yes, I did, Danny.
- I never moved!
- You did so.
I can prove that I can see you, Danny Myers!
[Laughing]
- Oh, my--
- [Laughing] Oh, my! Dorothy's sick!
Oh, poor Dorothy's sick.
- No.
- I'm missing one.
Don't poison me, please.
[Laughing]
[Coughing]
Oh, dear. Get me a Kleenex quick.
Get her--
Now let me take your place!
What will you do to me?
How many throats have you got, Dorothy?
I got two.
One right one and one wrong one.
Oh!
[Laughing]
I'll play dead again.
Okay.
Wake up.
I hated my anniversary, and I-I don't like anniversaries.
I don't like birthdays.
I don't think I ever will.
Maybe part of you was acting the part that--
Maybe you weren't here!
Walter was sitting right there, and I was lying down right on this couch... after my anniversary dinner.
Feeling how?
- I was crying.
- Why?
What were you crying about?
[Children Chattering]
I know I need Warrendale's help... and I know I want to be here... but I also want to be with my mother.
What exactly were you crying about after that dinner?
We've been through this mother business before.
I was crying about her, and I was crying about you...
and I was crying about--
About what? Walter?
Come on, say it. Don't smile.
- I can't say it.
- Yes, of course you can say it.
You can say anything that you feel like saying.
Why were you crying about your own mother?
Irene, why?
Why?
It gets kind of pathetic when somebody you just come to meet-- and your own mother... doesn't even go ahead and give you that kind of love... and somebody else has to do it.
You're angry at her for not giving you the kind of love you need.
And sad, too, because she wasn't able to.
You don't have to hide your face.
[Carol]
Fuck off. You can't do piss all for me.
Leave. That's what you can do.
- Leave.
- [Object Clatters]
No, I wouldn't like anything.
I'd like you to leave.
People keep on saying,
"Irene, you've changed tremendously".
Irene, you've done this.
Irene, you've done that.
But?
But it's-- it's me that has to feel it, isn't it?
So what do you feel that makes you think this isn't so true?
[Carol]
It's none of your goddamn business.
What are you aware of that you think other people aren't?
You shut up.
Talk about it.
When you say I've changed so much, and then I go ahead and take a seizure.
It's just--
It's what?
It's awful.
Why? When people say you've changed...
you think it means that you can't go back to your old ways of doing things, or you--
Well, I don't wanna go back to my old ways! Sorry!
But you can't change all of a sudden.
- [Woman] Freddiel
- You hate that, don't you?
- Freddie.
- [Freddie] Yeah.
Don't you? You're scared.
That's the thing you want to leave behind most, isn't it?
- Isn't it, Irene?
- [Sniffling]
Hmm?
That's the change you want most to happen.
'Cause that's the thing that scares you the most and hurts you the most.
So when people say you've changed, they're talking about that too.
They're talking about your being able to express anger... and other really harsh and violent feelings... so that they don't come out in seizures.
Yeah, they come out in walls!
That wasn't your fault.
Those two holes in the wall happened when you were having a holding session.
And it was the staff's responsibility to hold you so that that didn't happen.
And it's, you know--
It's as if they had made them, not you.
Because they didn't have you sufficiently safe so that your foot couldn't have done that.
They said I was safe.
You shouldn't feel to blame because you kicked those two holes in the wall.
That would be like punishing you for expressing your feelings.
It's okay to be angry, and it's most okay to be angry when you're being held safely by people.
But they weren't holding you safely enough, so that happened.
And think of how you are now compared to how you were when you came.
When you came, you could hardly even talk about feelings without having a seizure.
And, in two years, you've made terrific gains.
Another year, another two years, the medicine will be enough.
That and your handling your feelings in other ways will be enough...
so you don't have seizures, so you don't have that constant fear, Irene.
Okay, I'll be back.
I'll be right back.
[Woman, Indistinct]
[Crying]
[Woman, Terry Continue, Indistinct]
Hasn't there been a change in having the seizures?
- No.
- No? There hasn't?
No, because I'm still fucking scared of them!
That hasn't changed.
[Sobbing]
Yes, I do. I understand.
How much do you understand?
I don't understand it the way you feel it,
Irene, but I can understand a little bit.
I don't feel the fear that you fear-- feel.
[Sobbing]
It's a fear that will go slowly and surely.
[Sobbing Continues]
And the so-called friendship with Walter, it might as well be off.
Why?
Because. Why should I have a friendship with him when he's never around?
Just because a person isn't around doesn't mean that everything--
And he makes me bloody mad!
He makes me bloody mad.
He comes in that door and he sits down, he eats, he walks out the door.
Irene, that's because that's all he has time for.
Walter Gunn used to race up and down with me.
You used to.
- I know.
- We used to play games.
What happens now? Hardly nothing.
Well, we do some things together.
It's mostly all feelings, isn't it?
It shouldn't be just all feelings.
Well, now it's mostly all feelings that-- between our friendship, isn't it?
Yeah, I think it has been.
But maybe there has to be a time for that too.
Just like when we were first getting to know each other... it was games and it was fun... and it was things we could do without really knowing each other very well.
And now that we know each other better... we're able to share more of the deeper things, not just play.
Yeah, well, deeper things hurt too much.
That's why you need someone you know really well and trust well to share with.
It's like... the time we had together at first, we spent building something... building a trust.
And now that that's there, we can go on to share more things... that are harder to share and that hurt more.
Just like building a house.
Once you build the house, you add a garage.
Once you have the garage, you build something else.
And you grow and you become richer.
But it's hard work.
Pretty soon, maybe I'll become a millionaire.
But you know what I mean, don't you?
Yeah, I know what you mean.
It sounds so much like...
one day, I'm going to hit the jackpot and I'll be a millionaire.
What?
It sounds so much like-- [Laughs]
One day, I'm going to hit the jackpot and become a millionaire.
Well, you will.
The jackpot will be knowing yourself and knowing me a whole lot better.
You're getting there.
Well, takes time.
Yeah.
- Oh, no, it's not true.
- It is.
Well--
[Sighs]
[Walter] And you'll see there'll be many children who react with--
Not just because of their relationship with Dorothy...
- but because of all the things it stirs up.
- Yeah.
Because of the suddenness of it...
because this great, healthy, robust, uh, lovely woman, you know, who is suddenly--
just for no reason, is suddenly dead, you know.
It's not as if she was old or falling away or wearing away, this kind of thing.
It'll scare the heck out ofkids who, uh, you know--
who are so scared ofbeing annihilated themselves.
If Tony's already high this week, it'll just send him-- send him that much higher.
Dorothy was that much in-- of the future.
She could have become like a housemother, you know?
Her size, her looks, her way of doing things-- everything.
Oh, well, let's go and get some lunch ready.
- It'll be all right. You'll see.
- All right. I'm all right now.
So, you and Rachel just go ahead while Terry and I get things organized.
- We'll-- Ena?
- Yeah?
We'll clue you in very carefully before we have a meeting.
- Yeah, that's all right.
- Okay.
It'll probably be maybe 1:30 or so.
- [Walter] Pardon me?
- [Terry] They should be over here.
Hello, Debbie? Is John available?
For the whole day, eh?
Yeah, maybe you can give me a little advice.
Um, I'm down at Terry's house, and she has a cook.
She had a cook... who had become very much part of the house, you know...
and had become like-- like a cook-mother, you know.
She's the only service staff we've got who's really become involved in the program,
I think. You know?
And she very suddenly and very unexpectedly died this morning.
And so I wanted to get some very careful advice from him on where to go with this.
[Boy Shouting In Distance]
Ian!
Ian!
Yeah, well, this is what I'd planned.
And we're gonna have all the staff come in and do it very carefully... and be very prepared for it.
My other thought was, um, around a couple of things.
Um, as you know...
Allan King and his crew are in here doing the filming of the house.
And to me, this is an integral part of what goes on, you know.
And my immediate reaction was, well, we couldn't have them film a meeting like that.
And then my next reaction was, well, you know, this is what we're trying to do.
We're trying to communicate what goes on, what things are all about, you know.
I-- Yeah, they're used to all of the people.
They work very sensitively with the kids.
So I wondered whether-- if there's any limit at which we would draw sort of--
Is this intruding too much?
Is it going too far?
Is it-- Would it be more natural to have them film it than not to have them film it?
You know?
The one thing I have said, though, is that tonight... we were going to have both a hockey night party in the basement for the boys... and a card party for the girls upstairs.
I think we should cancel both these things out of respect--
- No?
- [Door Opens, Closes]
[Woman, Indistinct]
[Walter]
Oh, God. Just a second.
- [Woman] Do you know where they are?
- They're not here?
No, and neither is the green station wagon.
- Wait. The blue wagon's gone?
- Not the blue one, the green one.
- Was it in the parking lot?
- The green one's in the States.
I'll go ahead.
I may need to call you back on it.
We have the three big boys who are just missing.
Bye.
- I should have known.
- I'll check in the school, Walter.
Hasn't anybody checked them out, you know, periodically?
I've been trying to, Walter, but I've been doing all I can.
- All right. Terry?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go ahead on--
Just go ahead. I'll be back in the house.
We may have it at 2:00.
We may have it at 2:30.
The kids don't know about it.
We may have it at 3:00.
- All right.
- When we have it, we have it.
- We'll just carry on.
- Okay? Fine. Good.
- See you.
- Bye.
[Bob]
Did they take off?
- What?
- Did they take off?
- [Tony] Walter! Walter!
- Yeah. They don't appear to be here.
[Girl] Yeah, they did.
Did they take off in the car, Walter?
No, they didn't take off in the car.
The car's in the United States.
[Tony]
The car's in the United States.
Yes. Mike Kirkpatrick is out with it.
- Joanne!
- [TV Playing, Indistinct]
- When did you last see them?
- What?
- When did you last see them?
- I don't know.
I don't remember what time it was or anything.
They were just outside here.
Well, that's too bad.
I think we've let them down.
- [Door Closes]
- [Walter] Yeah.
- [Engine Starts]
- [No Audible Dialogue]
There really isn't very much point in going out here... but just occasionally, you know, you run into them... or you find them doing something.
Well, they've never been off together before, the three of them.
But, separately, they've, uh--
You know, before they came to Warrendale--
Alan, especially, is a-- is a serious delinquent, you know.
He's wired cars and stolen them.
Eddy isn't really a-- hasn't really ever gotten himself into trouble... you know, criminal trouble.
And Jim hasn't really either, you know.
The thing that worries me is that, together... the three of them may get involved in some kind of thing... that separately they wouldn't necessarily, you know.
Sort of to outdo each other, you know.
They're so fantastically competitive with each other that--
They'll get caught up in doing things that none of them will want to do... but they won't know how to stop each other.
They won't have enough self-control to stop each other.
[Debbie] If Eddy was sitting right here, what would you like to say to him for leaving you?
[Crying]
I don't know.
[Ena]
You don't know?
How scary is it to even think of what you'd like to say?
How much does it scare you, Laurie, to even think of how much anger you've got there...
what you might do if people left you?
How much does that scare you?
[Debbie] How scared are you that, if you say something to him like you feel...
that you'll lose him, when you like him so much?
I can't even think straight!
[Crying]
Leave me alone!
So you would recommend giving the police Eddy's grandparents' address.
[Woman On Phone, Indistinct]
I, uh--
His grandfather's pretty sick?
Is she-- Is she on the critical list?
I mean--
I don't know. It's pretty loaded isn't it, eh?
Yeah, well, if his grandfather's that--
If his grandmother's that sick, you know...
we hardly want to say-- or have the police go on barging up to the door.
You think Eddy would really take them there?
Maybe you'd better call them.
And just be as, uh--
Uh, extend yourself as nicely as you can... and tell them that you're very concerned about them and that, if they call there... could they please immediately let us know... and that the boys need to be back here and they need very much to be back here.
The three boys are doing very well.
But when they get together that, uh, you know, sometimes they're--
They get, uh--
They're apt to get into trouble.
Just talk their language, you know.
Okay? Fine, good. Bye.
Hi, Robyn. I'm glad you could come in.
We'll probably have a short meeting down here before we have the meeting with the kids.
Jesus Christ! How can you tell kids... when you don't even know the goddamn yourself what's coming off?
Well, what is it that you're worried about?
Well, you know,
I mean, Dorothy's at work yesterday... then all of a sudden today she's dead.
You know? The kids are going to be afraid that they're gonna die in their sleep...
and we're gonna die on our days off and--
If there's only something you could say to them, that would make it so much easier.
You say to them that, uh, it's a very hard thing.
You can be just as open about it as you want, you know.
- [Children Laughing]
- [Boy] Look at 'im, Pat!
[Boy #2]
Welcome back, Ed.
[Woman]
Patrick and Robert, inside.
[Patrick]
Shut your mouth.
- [Woman] What kind of a comment is that?
- You heard me.
- You just get inside your house, Patrick.
- Shut your mouth.
[Stomps Ice Puddle]
[Susan]
What's the meeting about?
- No, Alvyn.
- Just something.
[Irene]
Who isn't here that has to be here?
[Freddie]
Is this meeting important?
- Is there a special time?
- [Terry] No.
[Children Chattering]
This morning,
I got some very sad news.
I got a phone call from the hospital... and they told me that Dorothy, our cook, died this morning.
- [Children Gasping]
- [Girl] Dead.
[Sobbing]
- [Robert] What did she die from?
- [Carol] No, it can't be true!
[Sobbing]
It can't be!
It can't be true!
Staff, what'd she die from?
[Sobbing Continues]
- [Debbie Crying]
- [Carol Sobbing]
The doctors are trying to find out why she's dead now.
[Robert]
She was well and healthy.
- She was well.
- [Sobbing Continues]
- [Tony] Terry, are people--
- I know. It's so sad.
Is our staff going to keep in contact with her?
[Boy]
How can they keep--
- I want someone to stay with you.
- [Screaming] No! No!
No! Fucking let me go! Now!
Let me go now!
No, we're not going to let you go.
Let me go now!
I'll fucking kill myself!
No, you don't want to kill yourself.
Yeah, but it's okay! It's okay!
There's a big hurt there.
[Terry] I'm not going anywhere, Carol.
I'm not going away.
I don't fuckin' want you now!
I don't want nobody! Nobody!
[Sobbing]
What?
It's okay.
[Boys Arguing]
[Davey]
How would you like it if you died?
- [Patrick] You better shut your mouth!
- No, I won't.
- Yes, you fuckin' will!
- No, I won't.
How would you like it if you died?
[Carol]
I don't want nobody!
I don't want nobody!
I don't want nobody!
I don't want nobody!
I don't want nobody!
I don't want nobody!
I don't want nobody!
I don't want nobody!
I don't want nobody!
I don't want nobody!
I don't want nobody now!
[Carol Whimpering, Crying]
I wanna die!
I wanna be dead!
I wanna be dead!
[Sobbing Continues]
- [Boy] Walter?
- [Walter] Maurice, come and hold Tony.
[Scoffs]
So you can pull your bullshit, huh?
Just shut your mouth.
Now you and me, we're gonna pass--
- [Terry] Help me, Walter.
- [Carol] She can't be dead!
- Fuck off. Fuck off.
- [Walter] It's all right.
Fuck off.
[Walter]
It's all right. It's all right, Susan.
It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.
[Robyn, Indistinct]
Move her right back here to the wall.
[Gasping, Pounding On Floor]
Hey, it's all right.
[Robyn]
Come on, Susan.
You can let it come, Susan, and relieve your feelings.
Just let it come.
[Robyn]
Yesterday, Dorothy was here... and you were having fun with her, and today she's dead.
You'll never, ever see her again.
It's so hard for Susan.
Susan's lost other people before when other people have died.
[Crying]
You weren't even expecting it.
- It's just so hard--
- That'll do it for a while.
Let's move over here.
[Robyn, Indistinct]
[Woman Shouts]
Maurice, if necessary, you help Terry, all right?
[Susan Pounding On Floor]
[Boy Shouts]
[Irene, Carol Screaming, Sobbing]
Have you got her?
Let's move the table right here.
Pull it over, Alvyn.
Pull it right over there.
All right, bring the other one back.
[Terry]
Just keep on holding her in that way.
[Crying, Gasping]
Thank you, Robyn.
You're doing just fine.
Where do you want to go, Terry?
Before you move, I want to help her move nicely.
- What?
- Or else put my leg over.
- Where? How?
- [Alvyn] Okay, get in there.
You're all right there.
[Walter]
How do you want to hold her?
- What?
- Help me with this.
- [Irene Sobbing]
- What is it, Irene?
Come on, Irene.
[Ena]
It's all right, darling.
Nobody could get along without her.
[Pounding On Floor]
She loved you.
It's all right. It's all right.
[Sobs]
It's all right.
It's all right to cry, honey.
- It's all right to cry.
- [Susan] Fuck off! Get out of here!
- [Robyn, Indistinct]
- [Crying, Whimpering]
[Walter]
It's hard, isn't it?
Why did she have to die? Why?
It doesn't make sense, does it, Susan?
It doesn't make sense.
I don't have any fucking feelings about deaths.
It's-- She's no relative to me, is she?
- [Walter] Nobody's telling you how to feel.
- Well, if I--
- Nobody's telling you how to feel.
- All right, then just fuck off.
[Walter] If you'd like to talk to anybody about it, you're very welcome to.
- We know it's hard.
- If it was my relative,
I'd be worrying, but she's not.
- [Irene] Why?
- [Ena, Indistinct]
[Screams]
Get off me!
No! She's alive!
She's alive!
She's alive!
[Screaming]
She's alive! Still alive!
All right-- Hold her.
Hold her.
Don't get hurt, Robert.
It's all right. It's all right now.
[Screams]
[Whimpering]
- Let's get--
- Alvyn.
Let's move up against the wall now.
It's all right. I got her.
All right. Come here.
All right.
[Ena, Indistinct]
[Tony] But how can people find out if she's dead or not dead?
You know how a doctor comes up to you with his stethoscope...
- and he puts it on your chest?
- Yeah.
You know those things that go in your ear?
And you can hear like--
You can feel your heart beat-- like, thud.
[Robert] She could've had some poisoning-- food or something.
- [Tony] That's silly.
- Put it this way--
[Walter] Pretty frightening when it's someone that young and--
- [Tony Chattering]
- And you saw her looking in good health.
In good health? She seemed in better health than we are herself.
We don't know that for sure.
She seemed in good health.
Most people don't faint, then they go to the hospital.
Did she have a medical check-up before she come here?
'Cause you can look at her records and see if--
Dorothy went to the doctor about a month ago because she had had headaches that bothered her.
And the doctor gave her some pills for her headaches.
She'd be cut open to find out what's wrong, right?
Or she'd be looked at, and there'd be some mark showing.
[Bob]
No, she'd be x-rayed.
[Robert] Listen, if she was poisoned by food, right, they'll never find out who did it. Never.
[Bob]
They will.
[Robert]
'Cause it's impossible.
'Cause the only way they can find out is if there's something lying around.
[Freddie] She got $79 or something like that from this insurance company...
and she said she'll never withdraw it untiI she's old.
And then she'll have about
40,000 or 50,000 bucks in her old age.
[Terry]
No, you need my arms around you right now.
You're right here close to me.
You don't have to put your arms around me.
[Walter]
Why not? Why not?
- Because I don't want her to!
- Why not? Why don't you want her to?
- Why not, Carol?
- Why don't you want her to, Carol?
What are you worried about?
What happens if this happens?
You like Terry.
You need somebody right now.
Are you afraid something will happen?
No. I just don't want her fuckin'arms around me!
- Why don't you say what you're afraid of?
- I don't want your arms around me.
- Why don't you say what you're afraid of?
- What are you afraid of?
Nothing.
I just don't want your arms around me.
Why not? Why not, Carol?
Why not?
What do you think she's saying when she says that?
[Man, Indistinct]
- [Irene] She might die.
- [Walter] That who might die?
- That who might die?
- Terry might die.
Say that louder. Say that louder.
That who might die?
Terry.
- Who?
- Terry.
[Walter]
Terry, huh? I think--
No, I'm not worried of that!
So don't think I am.
I just don't want her crummy arms around me.
[Walter]
Why not? Why not? Why not?
- [Terry] Why not?
- I'll fuckin' sit on 'em.
Why not? What, are you angry at me?
Are you scared?
No. I just don't want--
- Take that arm.
- No! No!
No!
It's all right. It's all right, Carol.
It's all right.
[Bowl Clattering]
It's all right, Carol. It's all right.
[Walter] You're punishing yourself, Carol.
You're punishing yourself.
[Robyn]
You're just making it harder on you, Carol.
- [Terry] You don't need to make it harder on you.
- [Robyn] You don't need to be punished.
- [Walter] You know, it wasn't you who did it.
- [Irene Screams]
[Robyn]
You haven't done anything wrong.
- [Irene Screaming]
- [Walter] Watch it.
[Screaming Continues]
- Maurice!
- [Screaming]
Come on, let it out. Let it out.
[Robert]
Patrick, grab that pop bottle.
[Walter]
All right.
Watch it.
Sorry, Terry. I got distracted.
Turn her over again.
You grab one hand. I got the other.
You got her right hand?
I mean the other hand.
Come on. You all right?
[Irene Screaming]
Help me cross the other hand.
Hold her.
[Boy]
Ena? Ena?
[Walter]
Don't turn her head.
[Screaming]
[Alvyn, Indistinct]
Why?
Why did God want Dorothy to die?
Why? Why? Why?
[Screaming]
Why? Why?
[Sobbing]
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
- You open your eyes, and you take a look at where you are!
- You stop it! You stop it, Carol!
- You cut that out!
- Stop it!
- Leave me alone!
- You cut it out!
No, we're not gonna leave you alone!
People aren't gonna leave you alone!
- We're not gonna let you pull that kind of thing!
- We're not gonna leave you alone!
- Come back right here!
- Cut it out! Cut it out, Carol!
- You're here!
- Cut it out!
You're hurting me!
You're hurting my shoulders!
- You're hurting my shoulders!
- You're all right! You're all right!
- You're all right! You're all right!
- You're right here! You're okay!
- You're all right, Carol!
- But here is where you are and no place else!
Right here! No games!
- Here is where you are and no place else!
- All right, take a look now.
Take a look. Take a look at House Two.
Take a look at the people in it.
I see 'em! I see 'em! I see 'em!
[Terry]
So how do you feel about it?
- [Walter] Don't stop, Carol.
You're doing it again!
- So how do you feel about it?
You're doing it again!
Don't! You stop it!
[Robyn]
Carol, you knock that off!
- [Walter] And stay with it.
- I see 'em!
All right! Who do you see?
Who do you see? Who do you see?
[Terry]
Who do you see when you open your eyes?
Who do you see?
Get with it, young lady!
- Get with it!
- Who do you see?
No nonsense! No nonsense, Carol!
No nonsense! No nonsense!
- Cut that out!
- Carol!
- Just quit it!
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Just cut that out!
- And get back here in the house!
- You're doing it again! You're doing it again!
- You're doing it again!
- I'm not doin' nothin'!
- Yes, you are!
- Yes, you are!
Yes, you are! You're with us!
You're with us in this house!
- You're here!
- I know! I see you! I see you!
- Stay with it! Stay with it!
- I am with it!
- Stay with it! Stay with it!
- I am! I am!
- I am! I am! I am! I am!
- Stay with it! Stay with it!
Carol! Right here now! Carol!
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
- I am! I am!
- Right with it. Right with it.
- I am! I am!
That's good. I want to see your eyes looking at me or Terry.
- You're right here. Here.
- [Boy Chattering]
Carol, honey. Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[Sobbing]
I want Dorothy back!
I want Dorothy back!
I want Dorothy back!
- [Gasping]
- Just say it. Just say it.
[Terry]
Say what you feel.
Don't stop.
[Irene Sobbing]
[Sobbing]
Why did she go? Why?
[Screaming]
Why?
Why?
Why?
[Sobbing Continues]
[Woman, Indistinct]
Did anybody in this house do it?
[Woman #2] I wasn't down there when she came in, so I don't know.
Stay with me.
Gently. Gently. Gently.
You know, there's no reason why you should treat yourself hard.
I won't let you do that.
Let Terry do it for you.
Let Terry do it nicely for you.
- I like brushing my own hair!
- All right, then do it gently!
- You do it properly, Carol.
- You're doing it hurtfully to yourself.
Why should you be mad at yourself?
Why should you hurt yourself?
Now do your hair gently or not at all.
- You don't have to hurt yourself.
- You don't touch my hair.
- Obviously you're not ready to do it.
- Yes, I am!
Well, you show me.
You prove it to me.
[Terry] You do it gently, the way you're supposed to comb your hair.
I would like to see Terry do it for you.
I'd like to see you be able to let her do it for you.
I can do it myself!
I'll do everything for myself from now on!
[Terry]
No, you don't have to do everything.
[Walter]
All right, everybody. Take it easy.
[Patrick]
Well, she should have!
[Walter]
It's not an easy day.
[Chattering]
[Boys Shouting, Arguing]
- Slow down.
- [Patrick Jabbering]
- Slow down.
- [Tony, Indistinct]
- Pat. Pat. Pat.
- You just did it again.
Pat, you're a senior boy in this house.
Give Tony a hand.
- [Patrick Shouting]
- No, no.
- [Tony] You started it!
- You shut up!
- [Boys Shouting]
- Don't let Tony get going.
- Pat.
- [Jabbering]
- Pat, Pat, Pat. Pat.
- Fuck a pig!
Ena.
Pat, don't let him get you sucked in like that.
[Tony Shouts]
- Don't let Tony get you going.
- You make excuses for him every second.
- That's fuckin' not true, Patrick.
- It is, Tony.
Don't let him get you going.
Tony's the youngest, scaredest kid in the house.
- Don't let him suck you in.
- Oh!
[Children Laughing, Chattering]
[Robyn, Indistinct]
- [Susan] What about me?
- [Debbie] Oh, screw a pig.
Come on.
[Robyn]
Here.
Matthew is Dorothy's brother... and he's an immigrant who's come over here just last week from the Bahamas.
And he's all alone now.
So we're looking after him too.
For the next week, or months even, things are going to remind you of Dorothy.
- [Walter] Good. Bye.
- Who was that, Walter?
- That was Nina.
- What did Nina want?
Nina wanted to know if things were okay... and she wanted to tell me how the other houses were and how Eddy and Jim and Alan were doing.
All right. Hey.
- How come you're sweating, Walter?
- You wanna know how come I'm sweating?
I sweat easily. Some people sweat more easily than others.
It's just a way of life, you know.
Some people sweat a lot.
- This afternoon, your whole shirt was wet.
- Yeah, I know.
- Oh, you look pretty like that.
- [Woman] How was the meeting?
You look so pretty like that.
[Children, Staff Chattering]
[TV: Male Sports Announcer, Indistinct]
Sit down, sit down.
You don't stand up now.
[Tony]
Walter. 4-to-2, Walter.
4-to-2 on Toronto?
Is anybody betting Chicago?
I'll raise the bet to 4-to-1 on Chicago.
Did you win two last time?
Oh, those are mine.
Those are mine.
All right, sit down, everybody.
I'll take the bets separately.
- Sit down, sit down, sit down.
- Walter, 5-1 and 4-2.
The game's gonna begin, so we'll take the bets sitting down.
4-to-1 on Toronto.
- Kevin is what?
- 4-to-1 on Toronto.
[Boy]
Score! It's Toronto!
Odds are changing. It's a good thing those people got their bets in.
The odds are changing.
I get four, Alvyn!
Alvyn!
You got a lighter? Alvyn.
[Walter] Well, I don't know.
If I stay at the same odds--
- [Boy] Hey, Tone.
- I know.
You got a lighter? A lighter.
What happened to yours?
[Boys Chattering, Shouting]
Walter.
- Walter.
- [Boy] 4-to-2.
Walter!
Bucky! Bang, bang! 4-to-2!
[Boy]
Turn it up, will ya?
Bucky! Bucky.
Bucky. 4-to-2.
4-to-2.
That's more like it, Bucky.
And where's my pop?
Uh!
[Game Announcer]
... over the line. Back to Horton.
Dryden shoots! And he--
Oh! He missed the corner.
Hillman waved at it.
Keon tried to keep it in.
He's stopped by Kennedy.
Dryden back to Hillman.
[Walter] Now, we know that yesterday was especially hard for you...
and I get the feeling today it continues to be.
So I feel especially strongly that you have a chance to be with people...
continue to be with people.
I'd be very concerned if you weren't with people all day long today.
And just whenever you feel like crying, you need to cry.
And you can talk about some of the things you liked doing with Dorothy.
One of the things I want to reassure you very strongly about, Carol...
is that you had nothing to do with her dying, nothing at all.
- I know that.
- I know. I just want to reassure you.
Because kids-- especially you,
I think--
at different times around different people, feel that your feelings affect other people.
They can make them sick or hurt them or do all kinds of things.
And your feelings can't do that.
And anything that ever went on between you and Dorothy before didn't hurt her.
[Walter]
How did you sleep last night?
I didn't much.
Did you think about her during the night?
- Any scary thoughts?
- No.
You just thought about her.
What kind of things did you think about?
I didn't get to say good-bye to her.
Last night, I had a terrible--
I had a terrible fantasy, about 50 times.
- [Walter] What was it?
- That Dorothy was right up there.
- That's the kind of thing you need--
- And she-- No, she was sort of right there.
Not-- Not looking down.
She was sort of right there.
[Walter]
I want to reassure you of two things, Irene.
You had nothing to do with it.
You had nothing to do with the fact that Dorothy died.
No matter what thoughts you had in mind, what thoughts you had about her...
what things have happened with her-- you had nothing to do with it.
[Walter] Nothing you did had anything to do with Dorothy's death.
Well, I-I know that.
- Good. I'm glad you know that.
- I'm aware of that.
Sometimes kids think that their own thoughts or feelings--
- So? It's not me.
- Can directly affect somebody dying.
I just wanted to reassure all the kids and you, too, that none of you had anything to do with it.
And I wanted to tell you that if you had any thoughts or reactions to it...
in the next couple of days or the next week, two weeks...
- to get to people and tell them about it.
- Why?
No matter even if it seems funny or stupid...
or, you know, unusual, tell them about it, share it with them.
To me it's just-- Well, I'm a Catholic, and I have my reason why I think they die.
[Woman]
Albert!
- [Terry] Why do you think Dorothy--
- God wanted them.
God wants somebody, he takes them.
He takes them.
[Walter, Indistinct]
"We brought nothing into this world...
"and it is certain we can carry nothing out.
"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.
Blessed be the name of the Lord. '
And I woke up just in a certain, you know, particular way... that made me feel as though somebody had died.
And then I woke up and I thought,
"Oh, nobody had died. Dorothy will be in tomorrow". You know?
And I checked through everybody so that-- to make sure that everything was safe and that nobody had died.
And so the morning went on, and then it came to the meeting time.
And then Dorothy had died, so it must have been my fault.
- [Terry] No, it wasn't your fault.
- [Walter] Freddie. Freddie.
- [Walter] I want you to look at me.
- What?
- You had nothing to do with Dorothy's death.
- Oh, yeah.
And you know, if you have enough thoughts and anxieties and wishes...
out of a million thoughts and anxieties and wishes and hunches and feelings...
some of them will come true because--
By matter of chance alone, some of them will come true.
You had nothing to do with Dorothy dying.
- How come she was bouncing around--
- Dorothy had to do with Dorothy dying.
Yeah, well, look,
Dorothy wasn't sick or anything.
Freddie had nothing to do with Dorothy dying.
Freddie's thoughts didn't have anything to do with it-Freddie's feelings,
Freddie's actions.
- Nothing to do with Freddie had anything to do with Dorothy dying.
- Well, I don't think that's fair.
- What?
- I don't think that's fair.
And so--
Well, I don't see how she could have died.
So it must have been me.
- It had nothing to do with you, Freddie.
- Well, then how did she die?
[Minister]
"We meekly beseech thee, O Father...
"to raise us from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness...
"that when we shall depart this life...
"we may rest in him as our hope is this our sister Dorothy doth;
"And that at the resurrection in the last day...
"we, with her, may receive that blessing...
"which thy well-beloved Son shall then pronounce to all that love and fear thee, saying...
"'Come ye, blessed of my Father...
"'inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
"Almighty God, Father of all mercies and giver of all comfort...
"deal graciously, we pray thee, with those who mourn.
"Let us pray for ourselves...
"that we may always be mindful of the shortness and uncertainty of human life.
"Give rest, O Christ, to thy servant with thy saints...
"where sorrow and pain are no more, neither sighing but life everlasting;
"Where thou, O Christ, with the Holy Ghost...
"art most high in the glory of God the Father. Amen.
"The God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus...
"that great Shepherd of the Sheep...
"through the blood of the everlasting covenant...
"make you perfect in every good work to do his will...
"working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight...
"through Jesus Christ...
to whom be glory forever and ever.
Amen.'

THE PERFECT HUMAN
Here is the human.
Here is the human.
Here is the perfect human.
We will see the perfect human functioning.
We will see the perfect human functioning.
How does such a number function?
What kind of thing is it?
We will look into that.
We will investigate that.
Now we will see how the perfect human looks.
And what he can do.
This is how an ear looks.
And here is a pair of knees.
And here a foot.
Another ear.
Here is an eye.
Look at this human's eye.
Then a mouth.
A mouth.
And another mouth.
Look, the perfect human moving in a room.
The perfect human can move in a room.
The room is boundless and radiant with light.
It is an empty room.
Here are no boundaries.
Here is nothing.
Walking.
Running.
Jumping.
Falling.
Look, now he falls.
How does he fall?
This is how he falls.
Look, now she lays down.
How does she lay down?
This is how she lays down.
Like this.
Yes, there he is.
Who is he?
What can he do?
What does he want?
Why does he move like that?
How does he move like that?
Look at him.
Look at him now.
And now.
Look at him all the time.
Now the music is gone.
No music any more.
The perfect human in a room with no boundaries and with nothing.
And the voice saying a few words.
This voice saying a few words.
Look at him now.
Look at him all the time.
Now the perfect human undresses.
The clothes come off.
Bow tie.
Coat.
Shoes.
Trousers.
Boots.
Socks.
Dress.
Nylons.
Bra.
Pants.
The clothes come off.
How is it to touch the perfect human?
How is the skin?
Is it smooth?
Is it warm?
Is it soft?
Is it dry?
Is it well cared for?
How is the skin of the chin?
How is is on the legs?
The arms?
The throat?
Here is the bed.
Here is the bed.
Fresh fragrant sheets.
A soft spring mattress.
A bed in this room.
The room is no longer empty.
There is a bed in the room.
The bed in which the perfect human sleeps and makes love.
Listen to the human getting ready.
Listen to the perfect human living.
Listen to its sounds.
What is this human thinking?
Today, too, I experienced something
I hope to understand in a few days.
Around my left hand was shining a ring of hazy white flames.
I considered carefully the left side of my own dark coat.
In the middle of my heart there was a small spot.
I don't know what it's supposed to mean.
Now, there is a table too in the room.
And chairs.
And a human, the music and the voice.
The perfect human is going to eat and to drink.
We will see a meal.
How does the perfect human eat?
We will see its eyes and its mouth eating.
We will hear the sound of knife and fork.
We will se the fish being cut.
And the wine being poured into the glasses.
Dinner is served.
A lovely boiled salmon with boiled potatoes and sauce Hollandes.
With it a bottle of Chablis.
What is he thinking?
What is he thinking?
Is the perfect human thinking of the room he is in?
The food he eats?
Happiness?
Love?
Death?
What is the perfect human thinking?
Look at him.
What is he thinking?
Why is fortune so capricious?
Why is joy so quickly done?
Why did you leave me?
Why are you gone?
Why is fortune so capricious?
Why is joy so quickly...
Why did you leave me?
Why are you gone?
Why is fortune so capricious and why is joy so quickly done?
Why did you leave me?
Why are you gone?
Very, very delicious!
Today, too, I experienced something
I hope to understand in a few days.

He's come here from Chad, a four-year-old nation being represented at the Games for the first time.
He came with another athlete and an official.
His name is Ahamed Isa.
He's 22 years old.
He's much older than his country.
His father, a chief, died of smallpox.
At 13 years old, he began to run races at school.
He ran barefoot then.
Later his teacher gave him spiked shoes.
He hopes to teach physical education in the future.
He's studying for it now.
He's up for the 800-meter race.
Oda Field at the west end of camp.
It has an area of
16,752 square meters.
Athletes train here every day.
He speaks one of the many dialects of Arabic.
Isa will go home right after the closing ceremony.
His country is not yet very rich.
Though he may never be in Japan again, he has no time for sightseeing.
So, when he passed the preliminary, he was glad.
He felt rewarded.
The semifinals will be held today.
Eight men out of 24 will run in the final race.
How wonderful it would be if he could be one of them.
He tries not to think about that.
All he can do right now is run.
The Republic of Chad lies in Central Africa, south of the Sahara and west of Lake Chad.
It is three times as wide as Japan.
Half of it is desert.
He's always alone.
He must be lonely.
But for now he is calm and content.
The camp dining room is lively at night.

THE END
A FILM BY FERNANDO LOPES
He could have been a great boxer, one of the best in Europe, maybe even a lightweight champion, but now he's just a punching ball.
Belarmino Fragoso.
Born a champion.
That's why, by the blessing or curse of birth, he went to London to challenge
Vic Andeeti, after a nasty story, where his name appeared in place of his brother's.
With no coach, after months, years of hunger and misery, already old,
Belarmino set out with his usual confident smile.
Tell me about the fight in London.
As I told you, I was coming from Italy to get my brother; my brother stayed in Spain, and I left.
In the meantime I came to Portugal.
Somebody told me on the phone that I had fought in London.
I was amazed. I fought in London?
Impossible, it must be a dream.
Then I heard it on the radio,
I saw it in the newspapers...
I made a complaint at ANI,
I said it wasn't me.
I had never fought in London or ever seen London.
I'd seen London in the movies, but I had never been there.
So they said
"Well, then, we'll change that".
They showed me a photo and I saw it was my brother, like I said.
So I went to London.
In those days, Jack Salomon, one of the best managers in the world, hired me... he called me.
I went to London without a single day of training.
Why were you massacred in London by Vic Andeeti?
I wasn't massacred.
It was all a mistake.
He didn't even hit me in the face, he just shoved his thumb in my eye, it hurt like hell...
It was a violent punch, there isn't anybody who doesn't feel a punch in the eye.
I was on my knees, thinking
I'd let him count to eight, but when I got up on eight, for some reason the referee ended the fight.
In the ring at Albert Hall, Belarmino only lasted 2 minutes and 5 seconds against a second-rate boxer.
He's a desperate champion.
The referee counted to eight, and of course
I had to leave.
I started to protest, but the referee was saying "no", signaling "no" with his hands, meaning that I hadn't lost the fight, that the time wasn't up yet.
And suddenly... it wasn't
Belarmino Fragoso fighting, it was just the need to earn 15 thousand escudos.
Where does your mother live now, with you?
No, sir. My mother hasn't lived with me since I was 17.
I mean, since I was 15.
- And who supports her?
- My brothers. And she also works.
She's 68, she works because she wants to.
I always wanted to help her, but she always wanted to work.
It's what she wanted,
I didn't force her and I still don't.
I'm the one who gives her lunch and dinner every day.
She eats in the same restaurant as me.
She goes there nearly every day.
When she doesn't go it's because she doesn't feel like it.
My mother has four other children besides me and they can easily look after her because they have a better life than me.
My life is hard.
I started boxing as an amateur, of course.
That was my life.
I needed to earn money,
I was a shoe-shine boy, and then I started as an amateur boxer, with a friend of mine, who was a shoe-shine boy, too.
One day we went to the "Salão Lisboa"
- they called it "The Louse"... we went for the heck of it, to get money to go to the movies.
I didn't have any money at the time, so I went to get some for the movies.
One day he said he was going to train as a boxer. That was my dream;
I saw boxing rings in the newspapers...
- I was always drawn to boxing and always dreamt of fighting... so I asked if I could go with him, and he said: "Let's go check it out. "
I got to the Albano Martins hall, which was a sports club, and he asked me to step inside.
I did, of course.
Albano Martins looked at me and said:
"Did you come to train or to fight?"
And I said: "I came to train,
I love to practice boxing. "
I didn't know what I was talking about.
He gave me some gloves and shorts and I started boxing.
I started fighting with a guy called "Barraçal" (Sunsplat).
I was afraid of getting beaten up, so I started pounding him first.
Albano Martins made us stop the fight and told me I had talent.
On the second or third day of training,
I wanted to put the gloves on.
The other guys had more experience and so they threw a few punches and he was knocked out.
The next day, there he was again.
And when it's like that, you know you've got a boxer.
I got full of myself, of course, and asked a friend if I could fight him.
He punched me in the stomach and I fell down, totally knocked out.
Afterwards I started thinking that maybe boxing wasn't for me, that I was afraid, because he had punched me and it hurt, of course.
So I started to be afraid of boxing.
But then I started thinking that my life, the boxing and the shoe-shining, it was all the same, and I had to earn money to eat because I didn't have any, so I started thinking... I had a head, two feet, two hands, so I started to learn how to box.
I did four fights as an amateur, two fights a day.
But then I went to the gym and started thinking:
"I've got to learn more about boxing," so I started learning, and in the fifth fight
I won with by a KO, and I started boxing more and more, and after a year
I was the champion of Portugal.
How old were you then?
- I was only 18.
Before you became an amateur boxer, what did you do? Shine shoes?
I was a shoe-shine boy on the Avenida of Restauradores.
I used to run away from the police.
That was my life, running away.
I used to leave one shoe half polished, and the other unpolished with the police running after me.
I made my living from shoe-shining and boxing.
So what do you think of Albano?
Albano... his thing was always money, to squeeze all he could out of a human body - mine or somebody else's... to do as much as he could, to earn as much money as he could, because that was his life, as we say, being a "pimp", so I gave my body,
I fought, and got nothing for it.
He would give me 20 escudos, sometimes 10 and that was how I lived.
I'd go to his house, eat lunch, dinner, and sleep there, and I used to sell newspapers...
I had to get up at 4 AM.
I've been a professional boxer for 35 years and I came to the Mouraria
Sports Club on a percentage basis.
Amateurs here don't make any money.
As an amateur I got beaten up a lot but I never earned a nickel.
And as managers are professionals, they have to set up as many fights as possible so their trainees can earn money and so they can earn something too.
I don't think they work for free.
He took what he could from me, because he had to, it was his life.
He was born to be a "pimp".
- How long was he your manager?
- He was always my manager.
He was my manager for three years, then I went to Porto, I came back, and as I had no money to eat,
I signed a contract with him again and he sold me...
- Sold him? I never sold him.
So we went to Oporto and Mr. Ernesto Silva, after seeing him fight, came up to me and said he wanted to be his manager and could I release him. I said yes, but that I had to talk to him first.
I spoke to Belarmino Fragoso, explained the terms to him...
Ernesto Silva said he would have him educated, because Belarmino couldn't read or write, and he would have him taught to be a driver, so that he could have a life without depending on boxing.
So he accepted and closed the deal with Ernesto Silva.
Of course I didn't sell him, because I lost more than I earned, but I didn't get a thousand escudos and I sold him for a thousand.
I spent two months in Porto, fought five fights, but all I got from it was a pair of second-hand shoes, a raincoat which cost 900 escudos and that was all.
And he gave me 150 escudos on Christmas Day so I could spend Christmas in Lisbon with my family.
I can't answer that, because from the time I handed him over to a new manager,
I didn't see him any more.
One thing is for sure
- it was around Christmas time, he turned up in Lisbon, and even though he said I cheated him, he was the one who wanted me to be his manager again.
Listen, now that there is almost no professional boxing in Portugal, how do you get by?
I've got a newspaper stand in Estefãnia that my family looks after.
- I referee wrestling...
- But wrestling means bluffing...
Bluffing?
Honestly I can't tell you that, because I bet you don't want to go up there,
- I don't go...
- and nobody wants to...
- But is that the truth or a lie?
- if anyone goes there... it's not true.
- Isn't wrestling bluffing?
- The best one wins.
- The best one wins? Like in boxing?
Not like boxing, it's very different.
Boxing means getting thrashed.
- In boxing, the best one wins too.
- Yes, but wrestling is different.
What does Belarmino mean to you?
Is he a friend, a man...?
For me Belarmino was just a boxer, like the others who used to come here to the Mouraria Sports Club.
How did you meet and marry your wife?
That's a long story.
When Albano Martins hired me to box,
I went to Oporto, when he sold my contract, as I just explained,
I went up there, and three months later I met my wife...
- In Porto?
- In Porto.
I chatted her up, and of course, started talking to her, but I came right back to Lisbon.
A few months later, I went back there, and that's when
I decided to marry her.
Now she's my wife, the mother of my daughter... That's life.
- Does she work?
- Yes. And she's a hard worker.
She's a good housewife and she looks after somebody else's house. she's hard-working, and helps me in every way she can.
She doesn't earn much,
10, 15 escudos, but she's used to working, it's what she's always done.
What was your last fight to defend your title?
It was with Fernando Gonçalves Sotta.
I won by a KO.
And then?
Then I didn't fight in Portugal any more.
- How much did you earn then?
- 6 thousand escudos.
- 6 thousand. How long ago?
- 6 years ago.
The day before the lightweight fight with Sotta, he spent the whole night at
Bairro Alto and got to bed at 4 AM.
He went to the weigh-in, the compulsory one at noon, and he was a around 1 kilo and 200 grams overweight, so, of course he couldn't go for the title, with a kilo and 200 grams overweight.
So we went to Mayer Park,
I wrapped him in some blankets, made him run, sweat...
He did everything he could to lose the extra weight.
He weighed in, fought and won.
He could have been great.
You know, he could have been really great.
Other times, not with me, but with Bomboxe, he was training near Sintra and in the middle of the night, he would sneak out the window and come to Lisbon, to Bairro Alto, whenever he felt like it.
That's a lie. In fact, the room where I stayed at the hostel didn't even have a window, and nobody can ever stick that on me.
They can tell it to whoever they wish but nobody can say that to me, because I was always a boxer when I was fighting and I was an idol and I was a man who would fight any foreigner. I never did that.
I was always a man who never lost a fight.
And I've proven it!
I was champion of Portugal twice and I was always honoured and proud to be champion of Portugal.
He could have been great.
But he was not up to the challenge.
It wasn't the managers' fault because he had good ones.
But was it his fault or the fact that he lived in Portugal?
Had he lived abroad, could he have been a great boxer?
Yes.
But he would have had to stick to the training schedules and everything.
- He could have been great here too.
- Even if he was a bit undisciplined.
Exactly.
He could have been a great boxer and there was a time when he was.
- Since then...
- Now he's totally washed up.
Yes, and he shouldn't think he'll be somebody again because he won't.
He had good write-ups at that time, it was nice, because nobody had any experience.
They understood that I was a real boxer and many times as a professional, at the hands of Albano Martins,
I went into the ring on just a doughnut and a glass of milk.
I didn't have money to eat but I managed to win the fights.
All my life I took my fights seriously.
Maybe I was the most serious boxer there ever was in Portugal.
Thank you.
Who were the great boxers at that time?
Carlos Rocha, Chico Santos,
Fernando Gonçalves Sotta,
Fernando Branco...
They were good boxers.
They say you got into a fixed fight with Chico Santos.
- Never.
- Never?
No, we never could've gotten into a fixed fight with him because we couldn't stand each other from the start.
Why?
Tradition. There was always that thing of both of us wanting to win, that was our life, playing one off the other, and there was always rivalry.
Sometimes on my side, sometimes on his, other times on the manager's, and other times because I had earned more than him or vice-versa.
He didn't think that
I should earn more than him, and I didn't think he should earn more than me.
A lot of times they took my winnings and gave them to him.
Once, in my last fight,
I fought Chico Santos at Mayer Park,
I earned 12 thousand escudos and they only paid me 8.
They gave him 4 thousand without telling me.
I didn't even know how to read or write,
I was illiterate and that's how they cheated me out of 4,000 escudos, without knowing it was for him. Had
I known, I wouldn't have helped him.
- How old are you now?
- Me? I'm 32.
- Are you still illiterate?
- No, I've gotten up to the third grade.
A coffee.
Listen, do you think you're a man or an animal?
- A man. A human being.
- Why?
- A human being!
- Listen, sometimes people say that you're nuts and you're more like an animal than a man. Is it true?
We should compare a boxer to a human being.
A boxer is like any other man, even though people often think that a boxer kills, flays, does this and that. No!
A boxer is a man.
And whoever thinks differently is mistaken.
Outside the ring, are you a good man or a bad man?
I don't know, only other people can say.
I can't judge my own character.
- Does your wife love you?
- I think so, if not it'd be awful.
- You say you have two daughters?
- Yes. One is eleven.
I didn't raise her,
Agostinho da Silva did.
And I have another one who's five, she's great, she's pretty and she's smart.
But she was also really sick.
She had meningitis, and went blind for seven months.
People don't understand this.
My daughter was blind for 7 months, she had meningitis, had an operation for appendicitis when she was 3, was blind for...
Well, that's life.
Since the doctor was green, he said my daughter wouldn't live.
But thank God, she's alive today.
How do you support your family, if you don't work?
I colour photographs.
And I do this and that. It depends.
- And do you borrow money?
- Sometimes.
- Often?
- Yes, but I pay it back.
- To whom?
- Blokes I know.
If I need five quid, I ask for it,
If I need five bob, also.
It depends on my "need".
But listen, five quid isn't enough to support your family.
No, sometimes if I have dinner at a restaurant, I need another five bob to order something cheap for the girl and for my wife and to pay for a bread roll.
And to tip the waiter, so I won't look like an idiot.
So, do you go hungry a lot?
Three days' hunger isn't real hunger.
Often I want to have lunch or dinner, and I don't have anything to eat.
But it's not real hunger. It's a state of weakness I can put up with.
What about your other daughter?
I never raised her. I left her when she was only a year old, not even that.
Why did you leave her?
Because I didn't have any money to support her.
I wanted to box, the way I have...
I was already in love with it, and that's why some ladies asked if I would let them raise her, so I let them, because I didn't want to ruin my daughter's happiness...
I knew she would be all right with those ladies, and I couldn't do anything more for her.
Good afternoon.
Amore mio.
How are you?
Do you love your wife or are you sorry you got married?
If I didn't love her,
I wouldn't have married her.
I love her, I'm married, she's my kind of girl.
She's a really good girl.
She's got everything you could want from a woman.
But hang on, sometimes you run after other women, and you've had your affairs.
How's that?
All men do that.
As long as a bloke's lucky, of course.
I'm not stupid.
It's so cool.
Can I go to your place tonight to talk to you?
Listen, I heard you were hired as a bodyguard for a capitalist, weren't you?
Yes, but he started getting involved, so I let him get beaten up.
- I was the first one to run away.
- Why was that? Tell me about it.
That was good. Look at him...
That's a good one.
- Tell me.
- I can't.
- Why?
- Do you think my body's insured?
But can't you tell the story, or you don't want to?
It's a long story,
It's a 47-part film, mate!
- Did he give you any money after all?
- Of course!
Is that kind of thing paid in instalments? It's cash up front.
But listen, he paid you and you let him take a beating? How's that?
Sure, he started showing off.
He was on my back.
That's too much, isn't it?
Look here,
Albano Martins told us he was the only Portuguese boxer who had the President show up at one of his matches.
And he told us he was a great boxer.
What do you think?
He might have been a great boxer, but he was also a pain in the arse.

Wait a minute.
The eighth and second to last fight.
The moment of the international fight has arrived.
Tony Alonso from Spain... against the Portuguese
Belarmino Fragoso.
The fight has eight two-minute rounds, with Joaquim Teixeira as referee.
Are you afraid when you go into the ring?
Not me.
I'm just afraid like any man, afraid of making a fool of myself, like everybody else.
Carlos Ramos, a fine fado singer,
Amália Rodrigues, a great artist.
There's nobody who's not afraid.
We're all afraid.
But I mean, for example... afraid of losing.
No, no...
Afraid of looking like a fool. Winning or losing is just part of the sport.
- Is it? Do you think so?
- I do.
Do you think boxing is a sport?
For me it's a type of sport it's a noble art.
All over the world it's considered a noble art because it really is.
But boxing is an ungrateful sport.
Not boxing, the people around it.
It's the same in Portugal as anywhere else in the world.
Things have happened in Portugal...
It's life...
In Portugal there are lots of serious, very honest people, who've never gone into business.
Sometimes they go into the boxing business because they like the sport, because they're friends of other boxers, so they get involved, and there are other blokes out there who want to make money off of boxing.
The older boxers...
So, the ones who win in boxing aren't the boxers.
- No.
- Who wins?
The ones around them, in other words, the managers.
It's the people around them, like the ones who sit in the cafe talking about boxing, and then someone serious comes in to talk about it and they lend him money, and more and more money, and in the end, after lending him all this money, that guy doesn't win or lose any money, because the ones talking about boxing with him, start smoking cigars.
But are you saying that because usually people say that you are undisciplined and badmouth everyone, and you waste your nights and you drink a lot...
- Are you undisciplined?
- No. I'm just... The real truth is that I can't be cheated and I can't see anyone else being cheated.
And I can't be what they think I am.
Because a lot of times, like I said just now, I went into the ring on an empty stomach and none of the guys who badmouth me every gave me a penny for a soup.
Have you ever bribed a critic or your manager?
Me? Never. I feel like laughing every time people ask me that.
Critics only appreciate me when they have to.
There is this journalist, Mr...
- I don't remember his name... who writes for "Bola" and is very funny, in an interview that he did with me...
Well, it was not an interview, he just wrote about my life, he said I should give up boxing, because I was already over the hill, because I'd already lost a lot of fights by KO.
This man says he knows about boxing, but I don't think he does.
When it comes to boxing,
I'm a boxing technician,
I'm in the highest category of national boxing,
I see what's going on in boxing more than anyone else.
People used to say that when you were hit on the eyebrow you'd become particularly violent and you used to react wildly.
Tell me if that's a lie or not.
I only tried to defend myself.
Because the eyebrow is the most sensitive spot one has.
By hitting with your head or with a small open-handed slap, you can cut someone's brow...
In boxing we usually say, the best defence is an attack... and I would attack so that they wouldn't hit my eyebrow.
I knew if I attacked the guy first, he wouldn't hit my eyebrow.
And if I just stood there, he'd injure my eyebrow with a small punch.
But that's what happens in boxing...
Many, many times
I get punched in boxing...
I take all these punches but I never feel them, but sometimes
I just get a little slap and I feel it.
It depends on the situation, the place...
It depends on the situation and what kind of day you're having.
There are afternoons for an artist, for a good sportsman.
There are days, nights, afternoons...
Sports are based on all those things.
Sports are tough, but they're very good too.
When I talk about sports it makes me laugh.
- Why?
- Why?
Life is like a sport, it's beautiful.
We're the ones who destroy it.
- It's fantastic.
- Just one thing, Belarmino
You had a punch that was considered to be sensational, the one where you used the "one two"...
- No.
- You swung a left and then a right, but wait, people said that when you swung a left and then a right in the "one two", you dragged your arm, especially your right arm, and nearly hit your opponent's jaw with your elbow.
It depends on the boxing...
No, I never did that.
But in boxing, there are two methods.
Attack and defence.
The man who defends has to be a man who only uses his left and has to escape from the man who is an attacker or a fighter...
I am a boxer who attacks,
I'm a fighter, so I can't throw that kind of punch, because as a lightweight
I always get taller men and if I try for an uppercut, my punches will be inaccurate.
- I've never done that in my life.
- Never?
- Never.
- But the critics said you did.
They don't know anything about boxing.
They write just for the heck of it.
Don't hold on!
Second round.
Do you think you could fight with a man of your weight?
- Yes...
- How many punches could you take?
It depends on my training, my preparation and what I ate, because I have a wife and daughter to feed and I have to win.
A man who prepares himself for 10 rounds, 3 or 4, or whatever, has to get up at six-thirty in the morning, run at least four kilometres, do four kilometres of footing, and go to the gym.
After the footing, he goes home, rests, and gets up at noon, with no commitments at all, he has to eat a good steak, lots of vegetables, rare steaks, without needing the victory to eat.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Ritz Club is proud to present the second half of our variety show.
Women! Lets talk about women.
Did women have a decisive influence on your life, or not?
No. I just used to talk with them like I talk with all my friends, the ones that chat with me, that treat me nicely, people that I consider to be nice people.
Even if I speak to bad people, the ones who will criticise me...
Those are the ones I should talk to.
But when it comes to women...
I've only got my wife, and I live with her.
And before I got married and lived with my wife,
I had never been to a cabaret.
I'd never been to those kinds of bars.
I don't like wine.
I never drank beer.
But beer doesn't actually do any harm to a boxer.
Beer bloats you but it doesn't make you fat.
Lots of people say that beer is bad for you, but it isn't.
I used to drink to drink beer just like any other drink.
I drink more milk now. Doughnuts were the only thing I used to eat, because I was used to eating them when I wasn't boxing and I was having a hard time.
Often I wanted money for a doughnut and milk and I didn't have any.
It has nothing to do with women.
People always talk too much.
But listen, there are people who see you with prostitutes.
Maybe they do. It's natural.
They might see me with crooks, too, with suspicious looking men, but
I'm not suspicious because of that.
They can't pin anything on me.
I'm just a man, a sportsman, a simple person. I talk to everyone, rich, poor, crooks, prostitutes, everyone.
You said you didn't go to cabarets but people have seen you there.
Now. Since Bombox closed.
- Really?
- Yes. Why?
My life has changed.
Now fights are...
Before there were boxing matches every other month, but now there's only one match a year.
There hasn't been any boxing in Portugal for six years.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Ana Maria's strip-tease.
I know you want to go and work abroad, but you're a man from Lisbon.
Won't you miss the city?
Yes, very much. Not only Lisbon,
I'll miss my friends, the people who hang out with me,
I'll miss my daughter, my wife, my house,
I'll even miss the Portuguese boxing rings, because people applaud me.
So why are you going to work abroad in spite of all that?
Because that's what I should do.
Because there's no boxing in Portugal and I'm going abroad just to be a coach or to fight.
I can't go just to give and get a beating.
I'm too old for that, I'm already 32.
Ladies and gentlemen, the dance is next.
Do you think that when the viewers see this film, they'll feel sorry for you?
I don't know.
It depends on how they see
Albano Martins, how they understand him and my life, when I was a simple shoe-shiner.
Of course, I wasn't an engineer,
I went in for boxing.
If I were an engineer or a doctor,
I wouldn't have been a boxer.
I went for it because I had to.
Because in boxing, or in any sport, there aren't any engineers or architects who go into the sport and get their head punched in for the love of it.
It's men like me, bums.
How long do you think you'll last as a boxer?
- Until I'm 33, 34.
- So you've only got a year to live?
- To work as a boxer?
- Yes.
- And then?
- I'll be a coach.
I have the qualifications for it.
More than the coaches I see in Portugal.
- And don't you feel sorry?
- I'm very sorry...
It was the profession I held on to and will until my dying day.
So you're a champion who will remain a champion, right?
That's right.
And I'll make other champions, if my energy and health hold up, and if my life allows it.

The first home I was at was Nyboda.
It's out by Södertäljevägen.
I was there just
'cause I was bad in school and had some trouble at home.
I was there a while and then went to another one called Johannelund.
I was there a year and then was sent to another home in Örby, where I was four years.
Then I was, you know, released to a farm in Bohuslän, but you didn't get the chance to show you could behave, only a kick in the ass and then straight to the farm.
And then I was there a couple of months, and then to another home in VäIlingby, where the Welfare Bureau fixed up a flat they had.
I got a chance to come home then, but that didn't last long, but instead I was sent to a boarding-school in Hägersten.
Then I went to a farm and was there three months.
And then another three months at Skrubba.
There were a lot of car thefts, and I was sentenced.
Then it was reform school and then I came to Gräser.
I was there for two years.
You didn't get a chance there either to show you could behave, only release and if you didn't behave, you got pulled in again.
And there were a lot of escapes there and finally I ended up in Lövsta.
And no chance to show you could behave there either, only escapes and stuff there, and in 1964 I was sentenced to a youth prison.
And what I didn't know when I got there, I got taught: both school and prison, you know.
A trade school for thieves, you know, you learn everything you don't know.
That's all wrong,
I think you should go right to prison, and there you'll get another view of life.
I know what
I'm talking about anyway, since I've been locked up for ten years in different institutions and such.
There was a little trouble in the prison when I was there and there was a little brawl and I got another year out of it.
And then I ended up in jail outside Stockholm where I did nine months and then I was...
This is Tompa.
I met him the day after he got out of prison.
But he wasn't out long.
A month later I found out he'd goofed again.
He pinched a car and got nine more.
When I got out I should get a job, but I had no training or anything, the prison was supposed to find me a job and get me into a trade school.
Until they got me in there,
I should have had a, you know, preparatory job.
I worked for about two months without hearing anything about this school.
So finally I gave up and quit, so I forgot about it and went out to sea, but they cheated me here, too.
They said the boat was going all over the Baltic, to Poland - but when I got on it, it only went around Sweden.
Yeah, then about a month later, they put the boat in a shipyard and I gave up.
Then I started to run around with the mods and I don't regret that,
'cause I never had so much fun as last year.
I got to know Stoffe and Kenta among others and you knew almost everybody in town, you know, you were popular.
THEY CALL US MISFITS

THE MAIN SUBWAY STATION
We gotta hustle money for food.
Do you have 25 öre to spare?
Don't you have 25 öre?
She had knickers on.
Hi brothers and sisters!
Got any money, you open wallet.
You seen my broad today?
What are you doing now?
We're waiting for some stuff.
-What are you gonna do with it.
-What do you think?
-Gonna chew? No. She's gonna shoot.
-We'll drink.
-We've stopped turning on now.
-Have you?
We haven't for a week now.
That's why you're so funny today, huh?
Do you know what's funny?
It's you who are funny, huh?
Because you're always turning on.
You'll burn your brain out.
We're really great now, like a new robot...
It's not cool to hang around here.
Yeah, but where should we go?
Booze, that's the way!
Remember summer...
You were talking all the time, now you're like an old cactus.
An old mescaline cactus.
Come on, Stoffe.
No, that was just a joke.
What are you looking at?
Oh, go to hell!
If you had your own crapper, boy, it should look like this.
Yeah, wild - and on the ceiling the coolest broads in gold.
And the walls should be big aquariums with groovy fish, those broads with the ones who swim...
-Yeah, we're the best.
-Let's wash, I'm so damn dirty.
I just have to cut my nails.
Got a scissors?
Well, I can wash anyway.
Nowthey'll say: You can't stand here and vandalize!
Those damn guards are out of their minds.
You got a scissors?
No. Go out and lift one, mother.
I don't know if I have any butts on me.
-Got any matches, pig?
-No!
I don't either, so let's wait.
Are you all done?
No, I've got to dry first.
Now I can dare to show myself among all the capitalists out here.
Pull it down!
No, I can't fit in with those who are only interested in cars and football and when the liquor stores are open.
They're only caught up in themselves.
But these cats here like to travel and so on.
They like to try what's new, too.
I don't want to get stuck in the same rut as my father, you know: "his father was an engineer, so he becomes one, too."
Everybody has to be free to be able to do what he wants to.
They're great buddies in that way.
They're living for what's happening and that's what I'm looking for.
This here is too perfect, sugar-sweet, like a kid, whose mother says:
"Now, don't forget this and that and watch out now and don't take candy from any old man!"
Maybe not exactly, but you know what I mean.
It's just too goody-goody.
But these guys, they're really swinging.
They go out boozing on Wednesday.
Svensson would never do that, because he's working on Thursday.
But these are the things that make life cool.
To have a ball.
Here come all the Svenssons.
Hey, can you lend me a million?
The man ran to work.
He was a half minute late.
He dies.
The little workers look funny to me, no tails or ears have they to see.
Boy, that was dumb.
Oh, shut your face.
OK, anybody want some beer?
No, leave some for later, Stoffe.
I want my beer, Stoffe.
That's enough. The rest is all mine.
Hey, toss it here.
I want it.
-It's too big.
-Come on! Al Capone and his gang.
Where's my malt?
The opener.
-It's over there.
-I'll have a Tuborg.
Now, I'll show you.
OK, that post over there: 190,000.
Oh, I got beer on my arm.
You've got beer in the bottle.
-Who sees in Septober?
-That was poor.
So what. Start twisting, so you get warm.
Where's the opener lying?
It's not lying; it's in my hand.
Who's in the hand?
-Who's lying in Handen...
-...the police murderers.
They're alright now, but they'll be alcoholics when they're older.
But nowthey feel great.
I know for a fact.
Why do you think they'll be alcoholics?
Yeah, I can't explain it, but you can see:
Stoffe's old lady was an alcoholic and Kenta's was a real wino.
Those guys are boozing every day, they won't last long.
When you start young, it's really easy to become an alcoholic.
-Are you going to make it, then?
-No.
-Don't you think so?
-No.
-What are you gonna do about it, then?
-Nothing. I don't have to.
Won't you have a hard time if you don't?
Sure, but I don't have to suffer, if I don't want to.
Aren't you scared?
No, I've been expecting it.
How so?
If you act free, the authorities don't tolerate it.
They've got the power, and they don't want you to run around and stuff.
But you care about Kenta and Stoffe, but not about yourself.
Yeah.
-How do you care about it?
-I care about myself, too.
You're not afraid of not making it.
Still you think you'll pull through better than Kenta and Stoffe?
No, we're buddies and we'll be buddies till we die.
When we're forty.
Do you think it'll go that way for them,
Stoffe thinks he'll get married...
Does he? Then he's a fool.
-Don't you think so?
-No.
-What makes you so sure?
-I know him pretty well.
He's having his fun.
I met Kenta and Stoffe last year.
They had nowhere to live at that time.
In the summer you can sleep anywhere.
It is harder in the Winter when it is cold.
But I found them a pad in Regeringsgatan.
Listen...
Wake up!
The little cigarette.
Light it.
Easy, will you. I just woke up.
I noticed that.
Let me light it off yours.
Thanks.
Man, is it cold!
We have to get up.
Shut up, I'm gonna tune it.
You can't tune that guitar.
Oh, cut it out.
-Take it easy.
-Bug off!
Go and put on some tea.
-You'll never get this clean.
-Don't push me!
-I'll drink from it, anyway.
-You're all screwed up.
What the hell! I won't die.
I found the dinner.
I have to put on a sweater.
And give me the white one.
Where the hell is it? Oh, here.
-Do you want half of it?
-Yes, please.
Any liquor home?
Have a look.
Cherry wine. This much.
-I don't want it now.
-But I do.
See if you can find some more.
No, there's nothing more.
Here are some rotten tomatoes.
Potatoes and a lovely cheese.
Let's throw it out right now.
Can you help me rinsing?
Bend your head backwards.
What the hell are we gonna do today?
Weren't we going to the barge with Jajje?
Do you want to booze or turn on, or what?
I don't remember much of my old man.
But I remember when I was in a foster home.
I remember the birthday present they gave me when I was seven.
When you're seven, well, you want a lot of toys, but they gave me a trip to Härjedalen, to see the mountains.
When I got to the next home, mom was remarried to Benke.
Yeah, I remember once when she was really sick.
Benke was boozing as usual, but she asked:
"Couldn't you get me some candy?"
So finally, he got a bunch of coconut balls.
When he got back, he threw one in her face and said:
"Here you are" ; like he was feeding pigs.
Then he ate the rest himself, just to spite her - even though she was so damn sick.
Then my grandmother got her into a hospital.
I couldn't do anything, I was only 13, but I forgot about it.
Grandma took care of Benny, but I had to get along as well as I could.
Then I was with some girls and friends and ate with the girls,
'cause their mom was real nice.
I remember the lessons in school,
I couldn't do them at home, so I went out in the woods.
Then I quit school and started working.
Hell, going to school is just like a job, anyway.
I remember my first job was at a laundry.
Just a lot of old bats running around and I thought:
"This'll drive me crazy".
So I quit.
Then my mother started yelling:
"Get a job, you can't just sit here."
I had a lot of crap at my last job, and then I let my hair grow long.
Everybody else was doing it, too.
They were all putting me down, like I was a Negro.
All I did was run around buying beer and sandwiches and sweep out their damn darkroom, so I quit.
Now I don't work at all.
In school you didn't know if your father and his pals were boozing when you got home.
He might be smashed and want to fight.
When you took your buddies home, you saw how it looked in the window.
Or you heard a little from the street,
'cause we lived on the bottom.
Then you listened in the hallway, if it was quiet you went in.
I never got a key until he died.
So you saw how he looked and maybe he'd start fighting.
Once he left two bits on the table for me as an allowance.
It was a Friday.
When I got home I took it and bought some candy.
Yeah, and when I was outside he yelled: "Get up here!"
I didn't understand what the hell I'd done.
When I got in, he asked me why the hell I'd taken it.
Then he beat me up
'cause I'd taken my own money a little in advance.
Well, the old man died in 1965.
He had ulcers and the doctor told him to stop drinking, but he didn't and busted his belly and died in the hospital.
We found out at 7 in the morning when we got up to go to school.
Svenne couldn't go 'cause he was a little sad but I wasn't sad so I went to school like any other day.
While they were burying him,
Svenne and I were at dad's parents', and we had lemonade and cakes.
They were going to have a quiet gathering, but it was a real ball.
They were boozing and I was smoking in the john.
I tasted the drinks and the world's best sandwiches.
A real blast.
When we left, they were all a bit tight.
Then your pals asked how it feels with your dad dead.
Oh, I don't care.
He was just a pig.
I thought that mom would start taking care of herself.
It seemed pretty good in the beginning, but then she started boozing and old neighbours came to express their condolences with a fifth or four.
They started drinking and got all teary.
Of course, mom probably wasn't feeling so sad.
Once, he even tried to kill me with a tie.
That was the first time
I hit him, but I had to.
It was either him or me, so I really slammed him.
I was playing the guitar in front of the TV while waiting for something to come on.
He was bombed in the kitchen:
"Either the guitar or TV," he said.
And then he turned it off.
Then I turned it on.
This went on for a while.
He sat down on a chair. I got up...
Then he whipped off his tie.
So I had to hit him.
I really enjoyed it.
'Cause he hit ma when...
Once he got pissed and threw two year old Benny at the wall.
Now he says he never did it; we're all lying.
Last year in school, mom never woke me so I couldn't stay with it.
This is no fun, you know.
But if they had thought a little about my education,
I might have been a bit better.
I could have gone to trade school.
'Cause I'm not stupid,
I just didn't study.
There was always such a damn racket.
If it had been more quiet...
Well, never mind, I know
I'm gonna be a great man, but maybe I could have had some success in school.
You were always kind of pushed aside like...
Just because you were little, though you were damn old.
Now I'm so damn hardened that
I don't give a damn what they say.
But I used to be much softer, you know.
I could hang my head for weeks.
They really hit me where it hurts.
They didn't say things like "you blockhead", that's just a stupid thing you say, but there were other things like "angel-haired", and that really hit me.
It wasn't until my last year in school that I started to hit back,
'cause when I was little
I just said OK to everything instead of: "What the hell did you say, you bastard".
I was so damn mushy that I didn't dare.
When I was little
I wanted to be a baker.
I experimented with a whole bunch of stuff.
I really went in for it, but it didn't work out since they didn't give a damn about me.
But if it had worked out the way I'd planned, maybe I'd have had some future to look forward to.
When I came to EoshäIl, my nerves...
What the hell am I going to sit here for, I thought.
It all happened because my old man died.
And ma has some trouble with the bureau since they know she's boozing.
That's why they got me.
I know a guy who was busted 19 times, but he got off since he was in school.
Just 'cause I didn't have those possibilities, they nailed me.
I only came home once in a while, and there were parties, so I couldn't sleep at night.
Now I don't give a damn.
Why should I work like a beast, when they're just pigs.
Maybe I could have made it with their help.
I could have been a baker, eat a few cakes and stuff.
Could have been a gas.
The Welfare Bureau first contacted me when I was 15.
We pinched a motorcycle and went for a ride, my buddy was driving and the cops started to chase us.
One of our pals saw us and the bike belonged to his buddy, so he called the cops.
I jumped off and split, scared to death.
Later, when mom was in the hospital,
I was alone and really screwed off.
Anyway, after a few months, two cops came up and started to talk about this, but I didn't think anything would happen.
They were gonna get me a probation officer.
Then my mom got the job,
'cause I wasn't really a criminal.
Now, a year ago, you know, we broke into a grocery store.
We took some bread and I was put on probation.
Watched over by some dumb student.
He said that half the fault was mine and half the society's.
When I hit him with something he said:
"It'll be better if you do this and that..."
You hopped on the subway, went to work, then home, read the papers, watch TV and to bed.
Then I wanted a pad, you know,
'cause I don't have one,
I don't live anywhere.
So I told the guy to fix one,
I mean, he could fix anything else, put you in reform school and stuff, so why couldn't fix me a pad.
Two days later he called and said he was gonna quit.
"I can't reach Kenneth", he told mom.
Reach, what the hell, he didn't try to.
Now mom is watching me again, because they didn't want the responsibility.
They just sit there with their salary, and shove the papers into the waste basket.
That's the only thing they care about, those socialists.
Boy, the tail here's too much.
They're cool.
But they won't let you alone.
I've got my chicks,
4 or 5, that's enough.
One in Skövde, one in...
Well, you can always ride out and get some ass.
-Live like a king.
-Like a cock.
-A big tool.
-Yeah.
Crazy, man.
Screw it if some broad doesn't like us.
It's our own bag, but it turns them on.
So you bum a cigarette, and then you split.
They'll come back.
Let's go and get some malt.
Yeah, we've had some blasts.
Come summer, we'll bomb every day.
-Drink?
-Yeah, and bomb too.
What's that?
One puts one's penis in the vagina.
-Rocket in the pocket, huh?
-Yeah.
You gotta run around a little.
Imagine banging the same box for years.
Your ideal broad?
Like Brigitte Bardot, only better.
Mine should be blond with no skirt, and have hemorrhoids, so I have something to hold on to.
I want the clap just like my brothers.
You've got no brains, but I don't either.
Which broads do you like least?
The little ones.
Yeah, in sewing class.
They've got to be 17-18, and put their legs behind their neck in bed.
They've gotta know yoga.
My favourite chicks are between 25 and 30.
Between 90 and death.
-Shut up. Between 25...
-And rich too.
Yeah, and they say:
"Here's your porridge, dear."
Hell no! I'll always be a bachelor.
Here little girl, may I pump you?
I wonder how many kids I have here.
A lot, but I've never seen them, anyway.
Life goes on.
I must ask you something important.
OK, you're a chick who wants to be free and have fun, but, you know, I like you.
But it's stupid that I like you if you're out.
We should be together.
If you want to go out and have fun and I just say hi sometimes. See?
Huh? What did you say?
If we're together, we can go out a couple of times a week.
When have we ever gone out together, to the same party, for example?
I can't help it, it's just that way.
-Why? Can't we change it?
-Yes.
This hair's in the way.
Did you think so before?
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I did.
Did you? When?
I don't write down the date when I say something.
But you're so dumb. So strange.
What do you mean?
You're all screwed up.
Explain now.
One day you say you like me, the next, you ignore me.
You only think so...
Like when we were out last Friday or whenever it was.
-You were with Henry...
-Ridiculous!
You were with Lena or somebody and...
-It was Gunilla!
-Don't scream.
Anyway, I wanted to talk with you.
But you didn't want to, I figured.
But let's forget about what's happened and start over.
Let's just talk about it some other time.
Wouldn't that be fun?
In summer, we can run around in town.
Go here and there, your place sometimes, or ours maybe.
And Kenta must come sometimes.
I don't know what he's doing, but...
It would be fun, anyway.
Don't you think so?
'Cause you like me a little.
I like you a lot.
My mom read my diary to the councellor.
And it said:
"This evening Mona, Lena, Zigge and I are going out.
Then we got drunk on beer.
When we got there, we bought hash off Bosse.
We got a gigantic high.
Then the others went to a party.
Lena, Bosse and I were so high we just sat there.
Stoffe and Kenta were playing."
They opened Zigge's diary, too.
It said: "Agneta and I were alone at my place.
Fille, Putte and Lisa came.
We smoked hash.
Then we invited Kenta and Stoffe.
Midnight, they called and invited us there instead.
We smoked hash at their place.
We stayed the night and Agneta's and my mom went out looking for us.
They said we got kicked out.
Remember that great fiasco, Stoffe?
-When?
-In VäIlingby.
Harmonica, nothing was tuned.
When it was our turn, Ricke said:
"Here come the greatest!"
But we sat inside playing...
He called for us and everybody got curious.
Finally, they got us up there and the guitar, vong!
-It's all screwed up!
-I'd forgotten to plug it in.
At last, we got off alright.
Our fans...
...they're good.
We get so much from them.
Money and beer. That's what I like.
What else do we get off them?
Sometimes they satisfy us.
But only the president of our fan-club can come and focky-focky.
The rest are only cross-eyed and toothless.
"Play for us." You can't have that kind of fans.
I never wave at chicks.
No, you get punched.
Like from my pa.
He was a fan of mine.
Knocked me into the wall, he did.
That's our track.
-Here it is, the train we ordered.
-Hope there's a dining-car.
Let's check.
Can we have some Coke? Thanks.
See you later.
Where are all my fans, now?
-They've let us down.
-Bloody pigs.
Now we'll get the Dalarna girls in the barns.
Then the cows get so horny they jump the bull.
I like mountain cows best.
OK, here we are.
-Go in.
-No, not together.
Any capitalists, you think?
Boy, what a weird train.
OK, there's only one cat here.
We'll scare him off.
I got dibs on the window seat.
-Hope we're not intruding.
-Not at all.
Good.
-When's it leaving?
-Soon.
We should have a drink first.
Got anything to offer?
We're only joking.
Do they sell beer here?
Anybody out there?
Bye-bye, fans.
Sit down, pig. Don't shame all of Stockholm.
Great to be going. Bye, Stockholm.
Off to the harvest feast.
How long does it take?
We're there at 3.30.
Two beers.
And a sandwich.
-Don't you have coffee?
-Not before Uppsala.
-Hey, I didn't get any!
-Got any ham sandwiches?
How much is that?
It's almost shocking...
Seven and...
Let's say eight even.
You don't have to count.
Don't you have a servant?
Welcome back with more beer.
-She was getting mad.
-No, she was nice.
That was good.
Yeah, the pigs. They've drunk...
-That's mine.
-No, only half...
We were gonna split three ways.
Yeah, so you can't have half.
I get more than half.
-Are you dumb?
-Want some?
No, I'll have this.
Only I get a mug.
Beautiful women, here we come.
Boy, she looked like a corpse.
We'll take old Olga instead.
Skål, brothers!
I saw a stone that looked like ma's rump.
I'm a little tight.
Wonderful.
He went out that hole there.
I'm pissing on the snow.
We'll light up now, Stoffe.
You come later.
I can hear you, damn swines.
Open, for Chrissake.
Close it, I'm freezing.
Look how happy he is.
I coughed too soon.
Nobody's coming, good.
Wow.
-Anything left?
-A little.
Let's fill the pipe before Svensson's eyes.
Let's go back in again.
Where are we?
Damn if I know which dumb town this is.
We'll be there in an hour and a quarter.
We've gone two hours now.
Can't believe it.
The little man grinds - one, and nowthe next.
All he does is grind.
Grinding back again!
Nowthe flag: "Go now," he says.
Then he goes home to sleep and dreams:
"Ride train, the rails are right."
Then his wife comes and he gets like a sexbook.
Train with TV. Roll your arms.
When we get to Hedemora we gotta ask for the subway.
Only one elevator in the whole town.
We have to ride in it.
I did. Everybody did.
They don't even know what a circus is.
-Can I have a drag, man?
-You've got no brains.
You're like an open sexbook, man.
Yeah, C is on the licence plates.
It's Sala.
Sala, like in Stoffe.
Know any words with ala in them?
-AI.
-But say more.
Sala, well, rhyme...
Rhyme, what the hell...
Sala, kala and Kalle...
Oh, shut up! Where's the beer?
-Run, Stoffe.
-Yeah, take it easy.
Her eyebrows were in Septober, her eyes in November, but I'm on a train in January.
It's February.
That quiet summer night.
I came here and mom started boozing.
Stop, I'm going batty.
Here we are in Hedemora.
-Where the hell are we?
-There's Ingvar.
-Hi.
-Look at him.
Look at the bum.
Hey, it's not so damn long. It's OK.
Worse than mine.
The booze store open?
Let's go to a café and talk.
-Does your mom know we're coming?
-Yes.
Hello, everybody!
Now we shall booze.
Now we'll have some beer.
-Hi, how's it going?
-Yeah, it's going.
-Here's the whole gang.
-Take the door, too.
Who got my opener on the train?
Not me. There's one there.
I've been invited, so I can drink now.
-Want some beer?
-No, he's a teetotaller.
Harriet gave me wine and Stoffe beer.
Yeah, that's cool.
You're not afraid of your old mother, are you?
Any cigarettes?
-I don't know.
-Sure we do.
If I don't have any, Stoffe has.
When are you moving down, don't you know?
You're gonna be a dal-guy, marry a dal-gal?
No, that's crazy.
Where's the damn subway?
-Screw you, idiot!
-None?! Trams, then?
We don't need them.
When do the papers come?
Around 7:30.
How do you deliver them?
I put them here and there.
Is that all you do?
Man, what a lazy life.
In Stockholm, if you sell stuff, you can make as much bread in one minute.
You've become a bit lazy up here.
In Vällingby, we could at least move around.
Yeah.
Vällingby is a drag, but the city is alright.
You sleep all day, don't you?
-You bet I do.
-That's a drag, too.
Hell, you can't work.
Deliver papers in the middle of the night.
How many girls do we have today?
One, two...
We're not always like this.
Sometimes we've got more.
I usually have twenty.
Only kidding, girls.
Just one at a time.
Not like Stoffe, you know.
-He takes three.
-Shut up.
I'll help you up, man.
You were funny.
Oh, cut it out.
Imagine making a chick this way.
She swings so nicely.
I'm having fun.
Where are you, madam? I'm sorry.
He's out of his mind.
People are staring...
-Take it easy, will you.
-Yes.
I'm having fun. Let's have a hischelihischi drag!
No!
Take the hat, man.
No, they're my neighbours.
Don't we look funny?
-May I rent it for my honeymoon?
-No.
Don't take him seriously. Hat, now?
I'll give you a fiver if you take it.
-Are you going on this train?
-Then, we can kill him.
We'll beat the hell out of him.
First class, we can't get in there.
Good-bye, lovely women.
I get up around two in the afternoon.
Then I go down to the central station to sell, you know, then later I go out and have some fun.
It usually gets late, that's why I sleep that long.
I sleep in a hotel and that's nice.
I buy stuff for 300, and sell it for 700.
That I do everyday. Make 400.
Do you often take pills?
No, only Fridays and Saturdays.
-So, you're not addicted?
-Not at all.
Any other cats who live like you?
Well, I guess there are a few.
How many are there in Stockholm?
I don't know...
It's hard to say.
Why can't you live at home, then?
I was thrown out.
Why?
My folks suspected that I took pills, they said.
-Did they throw you out?
-Yeah, there was a fight.
They say I'm a junky.
But they never found one needle mark.
That's damn funny... then I had jaundice.
Was that from drugs?
Yeah, sure.
I looked like Mao-tse-tung, it looked pretty funny.
I was in the hospital and they took five tubes of blood.
I staggered out, all dizzy.
No, I don't think about the future, I don't have to.
Well, you know, I'm pretty sure of myself.
It'll all work out. It always has.
With a little luck, you know.
It's summer.
Kenta and Stoffe don't have anywhere to live.
They don't work either.
Sometimes I see them in town.
Shut up. You think more of Eva than of anybody else.
Can I say something...
What the hell has happened?
You've changed, you know.
-Yeah, what if I like Eva, then?
-You like Eva...
But she could come out with you, damn it.
Oh, shut up.
OK, let's put it this way: you were doing too many things.
You were money-grubbing, too much.
What the hell, I've gotta live.
You don't have to live like that.
Yeah, when you stopped,
I started smoking that stuff again.
They all told me not to.
That's none of their business, damn it.
A lousy conspiracy.
Your buddy who...
Can I say...
...put me against the wall and said: "Quit smoking".
Just because you and I stopped being pals.
Shut your mouth, will you.
Do you remember...
Well, last summer, we were all great buddies, you know.
They can all see you've changed.
-But they shouldn't...
-They wanted to help, see?
They can damn well leave me be.
But they did.
They can stick to their damn club, they're all little kids.
-Admit that.
-Yeah.
Yeah, you've realized it's all bull...
Yeah, now.
-But you were pals.
-Nothing to talk about.
-I realized it.
-Yeah.
-But too late.
-What?
-Too late.
-What?
If you'd known when I did, we'd still be pals.
But, if we're gonna be pals, you have to quit.
What?
Well, Eva, she can damn well...
...why can't she go out at night like any other chick who's...
Yeah but, can I...
She sits in her house like a damn citizen.
Not true.
Well, I've never seen her out.
I never saw her when you were out with your pals.
No, you haven't,
'cause we haven't been buddies.
For example, when you were going to that party, the guys didn't want you to come, but Eva did.
Never mind...
Yeah, and still you got hooked,
Stoffe.
You're hooked by her and her whole damn family.
Not true. Just 'cause you haven't found a girl.
It's not that, but you don't have to get hooked by her family.
-Have I?
-Sure.
-In what way?
-Well, you have.
I don't know, but you have.
-Don't talk too much.
-I don't.
No, that's just it.
I know what I've heard, but I don't want to hurt you.
-What have you heard?
-Can't tell.
OK, I don't give a damn about you.
Then you're hooked...
You've become a Svensson.
OK, I'm with Eva and we do what we want,
-and at times I'm with you...
-At times?
...and do what I want.
But when you're 17 , man, you shouldn't get hooked.
You only just started to live.
She called the Welfare Bureau to fix me a flat.
They knew I was alone here in town and had a lot of papers about me, but nothing serious.
So they got me in this place, but I didn't want to live there.
You had to be in by ten and there were only
" jail-trippers" there.
So I just took my bags and left.
So they said:
"If you don't live here, we'll put you in jail."
So I was out two, three weeks.
It was winter so I...
I had to go to my grandma and I stayed there a few weeks.
Then I went to mom in Gothenburg.
I washed dishes Christmas,
New Year's Eve.
A whole month to keep her quiet.
She was living with this guy and there was a lot of fuss.
Once, when I had no money, I said:
"I'm going home to put on the potatoes."
Outside I met a guy
I knewthree years ago.
He was going to England so I said:
"I'll come, too."
So I got my toothbrush and a sweater, and we went to England.
But we drank up all the money on the boat, and they sent us right back.
Then I got to Stockholm and I haven't done anything here.
Earned a little money - sold some stuff, lived with some girls and such.
You say you like them and live with them a week, but when you split, they get on your back.
I can never really grasp what I'm doing.
I never know if I'm staying with Kenta or whatever.
It doesn't bother me, though.
Midnight, I'll walk around alone, sleep in a hallway maybe.
But I can't go on like this for ever.
-I give up.
-What's wrong with you?
-We can't go on all night.
-We gotta find something, though.
I'm going, anyway.
You're a real buddy.
You know we've been drifting apart.
Well, go then.
Take your old cig and go the the Bahama's.
-Shut up!
-You belong there.
-What?
-The way you're acting.
-Well, go on then.
-Cut it out, damn it.
-You can come back.
-What do you mean?
You sleep in your hallway and I'll go to mine.
Not me, but you go.
Go in, if you're not coming.
Go on, then.
-See you.
-I guess not, but never mind.
Bug off, then.
Wednesday, April 16th 1746.
This is the advance battalion
of an English Government army of 9,000 men.
Their objective: Culloden Moor,
four and a half miles southeast of the Highland town of Inverness.
Their purpose: the destruction of the
Highland Jacobite army of rebellion,
a tired, ill-administered force of less than 5,000 men
who wait just beyond the top of this ridge.
Sir Thomas Sheridan,
Jacobite military secretary.
Suffering advanced debility and loss of memory.
Former military engagement
56 years ago.
Sir John MacDonald,
Jacobite captain of cavalry.
Aged, frequently intoxicated,
"described as " a man of the most limited capacities.“
John William O'Sullivan,
Jacobite quartermaster general.
"Described as " an Irishman whose vanity is superseded
only by his lack of wisdom."
Prince Charles Edward Stuart,
Jacobite commander in chief.
Former military experience:
10 days at a siege at the age of 13.
You must understand, without putting too fine a point on it, that the army here is in a total shambles.
I've got half my company missing.
I just can't find them.
They've gone off somewhere to sleep.
Your Royal Highness,
why exactly are Mr Sheridan,
Sir John MacDonald and Mr O'Sullivan
handling the administration of your army?
Because I chose them.
I consider those gentlemen to be utterly trustworthy and competent.
The first thing my men will find when they do awake is the enemy on them, cutting their throats.
James MacDonald, taxman.
Senior officer in a ruthless clan system,
who's brought with him on to the moor
men whose land he controls.
Alistair McVurrich, subtenant of a taxman.
Owns one eighth of an acre of soggy ground and two cows.
Alan MacColl, subtenant of a subtenant.
Owns half-share in a small potato patch measuring 30 feet.
Angus MacDonald, servant of a subtenant.
He owns nothing.
Lowest in the clan structure, he is called a “cotter.“
This man is totally dependent on the men above him in the clan system.
They, in their tum, on the taxman.
They, in their tum, on this one man,
the man who has brought them all onto the moor.
Alexander MacDonald, called, in Gaelic, MacDhomhnuill,
chief of the MacDonald's of Keppoch.
The owner of all his tenants' land,
the rem he has charged them is to fight with him as clan warriors
whenever he decrees.
This is the system of the Highland clan: human rent.
I hold my land from MacCruachan, as my father did, by bringing him 20 fighting men from amongst my tenants.
These I have brought.
To this man, who is rent, today's battle is a matter of honour.
I fight today because it is an honour to be with my chief, MacDhomhnuill, and because my father fought beside his father.
To this man, who is rem, the battle is a matter of revenge.
I fight first for MacDhomhnuill, then for Charlie.
Then because the Campbells, who did steal my cows, are with the enemy.
I have also raised over 100 men from Rannoch.
Some were unwilling.
With these, I used force.
Alistair McVurrich, told by his taxman that if he did not fight
he would have his cattle taken and his roof burnt.
This is the system of the clan,
a system that has brought on to the moor over 4,000 men,
men from Argyll and Inverness, from Moidart, Appin and the isles,
Catholics, Episcopalians,
Presbyterians,
the MacDonalds, the MacLeans, the Chisholms, the Camerons,
the Farquharsons, the Frasers, men of 14 major Highland clans.
Men like this.
Donald Cameron of Loch Eil,
chief of the powerful clan Cameron,
fearing for the survival of the ancient and ruthless society
to which he belongs.
Because he is here on the moor, most of the other chiefs are here.
Because he is here, Keppoch is here.
Because I feel that the Act of Union with England is a betrayal.
Because Prince Charles is a Catholic and I am a Catholic.
And the king in London is a Protestant.
Because Charles is part Scot and I am a Scot.
And the king in London is a German.
Prince Charles Edward Stuart,
the centre of all these men's hopes, himself half-Polish.
Age 25 and four months,
son of the exiled
James the Pretender,
he landed in Scotland nine months ago,
raised the clan army on a Highland surge of nationalism,
marched to Derby and came within an ace of toppling the Hanoverian dynasty
and regaining the throne for his father.
Though since forced to retreat back into the Highlands
and despite all evidence to the contrary,
Charles remains supremely confident
both of victory and his welcome by the English people.
King George ll is both a usurper and a tyrant.
He's kept my father's crown by enslaving all the people of this island.
He's deemed unpopular and I know that once victory is mine the people of England will welcome me.
Lord George Murray, age 51.
Lieutenant General in the clan army.
As their commanding officer,
this man forged the undisciplined Highlanders
into an army that not only almost reached London
but that also twice reduced superior English forces
into a panic-stricken rout,
first at Prestonpans, then at Falkirk.
Blunt, imperious, this man has bitterly quarreled with Charles
over the chaos in the army administration
and over the choice of this battlefield,
chosen by John William O'Sullivan.
Flat, treeless, devoid of shelter,
ideal for the employment by the British army
of its cannon and cavalry.
And from behind the shelter of these walls,
which O'Sullivan has refused to pull down,
Lord George Murray also fears both crossfire and outflanking.
Mr O'Sullivan,
in view of what Lord George feels about the battlefield,
have you inspected the ground yourself?
- No, I have not.
- Why not?
Because I don't deem it necessary.
It is a large, plain moor and, as such, it's a fair field for the enemy horse and cannon against which the
Highlanders will be defenceless.
I have informed His Royal Highness that it is a good field which I believe it to be.
I have told the Prince
I do not like it.
Your Highness, why are you fighting today,
when the ground here has been criticized by some of your officers?
Because God is on our side and I am convinced that my duty to my people lies in fighting today.
It's my opinion that the choice of the field for us is suicidal.
9,000 men, 16 battalions of infantry,
12 squadrons of cavalry,
8 companies of militia,
220,000 rounds of musket ammunition,
10 three-pounder battalion cannons,
800 three-pound cannonballs,
500 bags of cannon grapeshot.
This man's name is Fraser.
A deserter from the Government army, he still wears its uniform
but now stands in the ranks of the Prince's army,
amongst the men of his own clan and name.
He knows that, if he is captured as a deserter,
he will be immediately court-martialled to a sentence of death by throttling.
These are the Wild Geese,
150 exiled Irishmen
sewing in the army of His Most Christian Majesty,
Louis XV of France, the most powerful ally of the Stuart cause.
Brigadier General Walter Stapleton,
commander, Irish pickets of the French army.
Yes, we're here because
Prince Charles is a Catholic.
It will be a fine thing for all Catholics when Charlie's on the throne and German George is off it.
If we had a Catholic king on the throne in this country, then we could get back to living in our own.
You must remember that your Protestant king in London is passing penal laws against the Catholics in Ireland.
I'm from County Tipperary.
Now I've got to live in Boulogne.
You won't find a Catholic Irishman with much cause to love George ll.
William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, third son of King George ll.
Age 25 and one day.
Commander in chief of the Government army in Scotland.
Salary £15,000 per year.
Alexander Laing, private.
Salary sixpence a day.
Patrick McColman, three days ago a sergeant,
two days ago 800 lashes for looting, today a private.
John Mallaby, private.
Pressed into service.
William Roach, private.
Two years of his pay would not buy even the wig and hat
of the officer marching in from of him.
Joshua Ward, lieutenant, British army,
a fraternity where the least pretension to learning, to piety or to common morals
would endanger the owner to be cashiered.
I will now pass... in the middle of the second line.
Your Highness.
Give me a battery in the centre of the front line.
Alexander Laing carries a .753 musket,
firing a ball of one ounce and a third weight
an effective distance of 60 paces.
He carries sufficient ball, paper and black powder for 24 cartridges.
He carries at his hip a brass-hiked sword
and a bayonet with 18 inches of ﬂuted steel.
Alistair McVurrich carries in his right hand
an outdated dragoon pistol
for which he has no further ammunition.
What's the gun you're sewing?
It's a three-pounder.
Right now, it's downright useless.
Why's that?
We've only got 4 lb ammunition for it.
I tell you, it's chaos.
Half the ammunition's with the food.
That's still back in Inverness.
I haven't eaten for...
I don't know how long.
Ah, well now... that really is not my responsibility.
But, Mr O'Sullivan, you are the quartermaster general
and, as such, surely you're responsible for the distribution of food.
In normal circumstances, yes but now, as I am much pressed by other affairs,
I have given that responsibility to someone else.
When was the last time you ate?
Two days ago.
The day before yesterday.
This morning he killed a pig but wasn't allowed time to eat it.
I can't remember.
Andrew Henderson, Whig historian, biographer of Cumberland,
eyewitness of the Battle of Culloden.
The time is 12:15.
Now this wall, behind which we're sheltering, is at approximately right angles to the rebel lines.
I've drawn a rough sketch map here.
The rebel lines are here.
We are here.
And the Duke of Cumberland's army is here.
9,000 men in 16 infantry battalions
three of which are themselves Scot,
a total of 1,300 regular soldiers from the Lowlands,
plus, in reserve, the volunteer militias
of Stirling, Edinburgh,
Dumfries and Glasgow,
a further 8,000 men.
Charles Edward Stuart,
regent claimant to the thrones of England and Scotland,
has more Scots-in-arms against him than for him.
And, ranged against him in the Highlands,
he has the Whig clans siding with the Government,
the Munros, the Rosses, the MacKenzies,
the McLeods of Skye, the Sutherlands,
and here on the moor, the Campbells of the Argyll militia.
Here to fight Charles and his rebellion, here to take clan revenge,
Angus Ian Campbell,
wife murdered by the MacDonalds.
Alistair MacDonald, brother killed by Campbells in a cattle raid.
For him, loyalties to Charlie mean little.
For him, today's battle is a clan battle.
The swords those bastards use can cut a man in half.
Well, I reckon we'll have them this time.
- Why do you say that?
- We've got a new bayonet drill, see.
You don't poke at the man in front of you.
You poke at the man coming at your chum on the right.
That means, as he's lifting his sword arm, you get him underneath, like.
What do you think about the rebels?
Well... I ain't taken me clothes off for six weeks.
I reckon till we lay them bastards out I won't, neither.
I'll tell you one thing.
I know a lot of the boys make fun of our Billy Cumberland but I reckon he's all right.
He's a tough bastard but at least he feeds you which is more than some of them do.
I've heard said the rebels want to cut him as small as herbs for the pot.
Well... I don't reckon that.
They're a lot of friggin' savages.
Donald Gram, a farmer,
forced a month ago into the Highland army,
twice has deserted back to farm and family,
twice has been captured and forced to return.
Euan MacDonald, farmer,
forced into the Highland army the day before yesterday.
With him his son,
John Angus MacDonald,
the day before yesterday a ploughboy,
today a rebel in arms.
His age, 13.
I can't just make out what's happening in the rebel lines.
There's much confusion of movement.
Large numbers of men are moving about, changing their position... and there are large gaps in the centre.
It seems to me as though the entire line is completely askew.
Why is this?
We are all MacDonalds and, as such, we are entitled to stand on the right in the line of battle.
This is an ancient
MacDonald privilege and yet Mr O'Sullivan has thought fit to place
Lord George Murray's men in that position.
The main reason is that yesterday the Prince had an idea for a surprise march by night on the camp of Cumberland.
This we attempted. It failed.
But it meant that we were all up marching the entire night.
Consequently, the men are exhausted and are still stumbling into their positions.
What effect has this had on your men?
Look at them.
When did you last sleep?
As far as I am concerned, we are now putting an end to a bad affair.
The Scots are fair fighters until a crisis is reached and it's my opinion we've now reached that crisis.
With all these things amiss in our army, it would have been better had the
Prince made some plan for retreat.
Bu! Charles has made no plans for retreat.
He says that only those who are afraid can doubt his coming victory.
He puts from his mind the discontent of the MacDonalds,
the fatigue and hunger of his men,
the total outnumbering of his army,
the thinning of ranks by desertion,
the ill choice of battlefield,
convinced as he is of the invincibility of his men.
God is on our side.
Our cause is just and we will triumph this day.
The soldiers in the Elector's army know me to be their lawful Prince.
And so I'm convinced they'll break in panic, for they will never dare fight me.
Battalion, fix your bayonets.
Fix.
This man's name is Chisholm,
James Chisholm.
A private in the Government army, he is also a Highland Scot.
This man's name too is Chisholm,
Roderick Og Chisholm.
Fifth son of the clan chief,
he stands before his men in the Prince's army.
The Chisholm 500 yards away is this man's brother.
Charles Edward Stuart's war is a civil war.
They've started.
The rebel cannon have opened fire.
The cannon have opened from the rebels' centre and they're over-elevated.
Fire!
Batteries... from open sights... at will... fire!
Pull!
Fire!
Fire!
That's the Duke of Cumberland's cannons.
Cannonades all around me!
I'm going to have to shout to make myself heard!
The smoke is beginning to thicken.
It's going to be very difficult to see what effect our cannon is having on the rebel lines.
A cast-iron ball of three pounds' weight, fired from open sights.
This is roundshot.
This is what it does.
Pull!
Alistair McInnes, age 20.
Right leg severed below knee joint.
Malcolm Angus Chisholm, age 24.
Disembowelled.
Ian MacDonald, age 13. Shot.
1:12.
Dazed, indecisive, Charles has moved to behind
the right ﬂank of the Jacobite lines
and is now unable to see what is happening to his army.
Ordered by O'Sullivan to stand in the ranks six-deep,
the men on the Highland right
make a clear and tight-packed target for the English gunners.
Pull!
The rebels' artillery have stopped firing altogether and, before they did, we counted...
How many?
We counted 15 to 20 shots fired by our artillery for every one fired by the rebels.
1:17.
The second result of
O'Sullivan's administration.
The Prince's artillery, iii-fed by a sporadic ammunition supply,
ill-served by untrained amateurs,
ceases fire.
Pull!
Have you had orders to attack, sir?
- No, I've had none!
- Well, why not?
The Prince hasn't given any!
If he doesn't give them soon, he'll lose the entire army!
We're being shelled to pieces!
Pull!
Reload!
Pull!
Reload!
- What's the Prince doing?
- I don't know!
Nobody knows what he's doing!
1:22. Prince Charles Stuart, paralyzed with indecision,
still has given no order, either to advance or to retreat.
1:22. Clan Cameron,
200 men, shot to pieces.
Clan Stewart,
180 men, shot to pieces.
This is fantastic!
If this keeps up much longer, our gunners will have finished the whole affair.
The cannonade... The cannonade has given our men infinite spirits.
Clan Chisholm casualties,
47 killed or maimed.
This is incredible! Those men have been standing there for 22 minutes!
They're just lining the ranks!
The rebels are being literally blown apart!
Why are they standing there?
Why in God's name don't they run?
1:30. Still no order to advance.
Clan army casualties,
700 dead or maimed.
Charles Stuart hopes that by not advancing
he will tempt the Government army out of its battle lines to attack him.
1:32 pm. Cumberland orders a move
but not the one his cousin is expecting.
I want Wolfe's battalion to advance inside on the left!
Your Highness!
At 1:32, Cumberland places a battalion
behind one of the walls
O'Sullivan has refused to pull down,
to fire into the side of the clan army
when it charges the Government front.
This is the crossfire
O'Sullivan said would never happen.
Oh, yes, yes... Units of the Argyll... the Campbell-Argyll militia, yes?
And there are squadrons of dragoons with them.
Yes, it's obvious that
His Royal Highness has decided to have units of the Campbell-Argyll militia and some squadrons of dragoons to go down behind the south side of this wall, out of sight of the enemy, to take them in the rear and outflank the rebels.
Thus, also at 1:32 pm,
begins the outﬂanking movement
that O'Sullivan said would never happen.
29 minutes too late,
Charles Stuart orders an advance
along the entire from of the Jacobite army.
And you make the right side advance!
Bu! The message fails to reach the right wing.
Casualties, 850.
Have you still had no orders to attack?
No! I've had no orders!
I had a message from Mr O'Sullivan, which, as ever,
I failed to comprehend!
- The line's broken up!
- What?
They're charging, they're coming straight at us!
Sir, the right has broken forward!
The walls will hold them.
- They're going straight!
- Get down behing the wall there!
After 28 minutes of cannonfire!
What sort of men are these?
- Right! Change from ball to grape.
- Change from ball to grape!
A cylindrical canvas bag eight inches in length,
packed with musketballs and pieces of jagged iron.
This is grapeshot.
This is what it does.
Pull!
Pull!
It must be the grape! The centre has collided with the right.
There's great confusion, bodies flying!
They must be going to receive fire from our centre battalions!
Charge! Charge!
Fire!
Bastards!
God, they're almost upon us!
They're firing from this side and from this side.
They're been cut to pieces!
It must be chaos behind those walls!
Chaos!
Barrell's!
Towards this one regiment,
Barrell's Fourth of Foot,
heads the entire right of the clan army,
800 men in a solid clump,
running with a collision speed of over 12 miles an hour.
Alternate... firing!
Battalion, take care.
Fall in by rank. Take aim!
Rear rank, present!
Rear rank, fire!
Fire!
Front rank, take aim!
Front rank, fire!
Rear rank, present.
Fire!
Centre rank, present.
Front rank, present.
Remember, Barrell's, off to the right!
They've broken through Barrell's!
General Huske, advance Bligh's and Semphill's, support on the left.
Your Highness.
1:57 and the Duke of Cumberland sees the men of his second line,
placed there for just such an emergency, fire with crippling effect
into the Highlanders who broke through the from line.
1:57. Charles Stuart, who has made no battle plan at all,
sees, on the right wing, his men run from this concentrated musketfire
and sees, on his left wing,
the MacDonalds, tired, hungry,
rebellious at not being given their rightful battle position by O'Sullivan,
hold back from charging the royal army right.
Instead, they stand and taunt,
trying to tempt the royal army lines forward in disorder.
Battalion Pulteney's, make ready!
They're stopping to pick up stones!
Shoot!
1:58. The MacDonalds, dismayed at the sight of the advancing cavalry,
themselves draw back.
Keppoch, one of their leaders,
runs forward with other clan officers to encourage them
and is shot through twice by musketball.
About him, his men tum and run.
Time 1:59 pm.
The rout of the Highland army begins.
Christ, they're running.
They're leaving the field except for two small units, the French and the Irish.
Let them through. Stand your ground.
Guard, forward!
Oh, Jesus!
Front rank, present. Fire!
Re-form! Re-form!
Stand and aim! Fire!
Walter Stapleton, commander, Irish pickets,
cut down with 100 of his men
as the Scots about them run.
Where are you going, you?
Charles Stuart tries to rally his men.
"Pray stand with me, your Prince," he cries.
"Pray stand with me but a moment, otherwise you ruin me,
"your country and yourselves and God forgive you.“".
But it is too late.
At one minute past two in the afternoon,
his cause in ruins,
Charles Edward Stuart is led from the battlefield
by the man most responsible for his defeat.
As Charles leaves, a senior clan officer screams after him,
"Run, you cowardly Italian."
- Mr Fossett.
- Your Highness?
- You will order a general ceasefire.
- Your Highness.
Of the 9,000 men of the royal army
who advanced this morning from Naim with Private Laing,
an estimated 50 are dead.
Bu! For every one corpse in the royal army
there are 24 in the clan army.
Piled in layers, dead or dying,
are 1,200 men...
including the brother of Private James Chisholm.
There was scarce a soldier or officer of Barrell's Fourth of Foot
who did not kill one or two men each with their bayonets or spontoons.
Not a bayonet but was bent and stained with blood
to the muzzles of their muskets.
All witnesses agreed that, if grapeshot were the king of battles,
the bayonet was now the queen of weapons.
"It is mine and everybody': opinion," boasts a trooper,
"that no history can brag of so singular a victory."
How do you feel?
Don't feel nothing, really.
I feel all right!
Well, now it's over.
Battalion, take care!
Halt!
2:14pm. The battalions of Cumberland
halt at the lines held by the rebels one hour and eight minutes ago.
Battalion, shoulder your firelocks!
Three cheers for His Royal Highness!
- Hip, hip!
- Hurrah!
Thus has ended the last battle to be fought in Britain
and the last armed attempt to overthrow its king.
The Establishment has been saved, peace restored,
Church, Crown, trade and commerce safeguarded.
Thus the Duke of Cumberland won his only victory
and Charles suffered his only defeat.
His advisers are shortly to urge his instructions for reassembly.
"He is to reply, " Do as you wish.
Only, for God's sake, let us go.“
Charles Edward Stuart, his cause now in ruins,
has given one order too many.
Charles pitted these men against the modem musket and bayonet,
against cavalry and cannon.
Thus, in one hour, eight minutes,
he has reduced the ﬂower of the Highland clans
to twitching, limbless corpses.
2:30 pm and His Royal Highness, the Duke of Cumberland,
orders rum and brandy, cheese and biscuits for his “brave boys.“
For the wounded and dying clansmen on the moor,
there is to be different treatment.
All over the battlefield, whilst the
Duke of Cumberland eats his lunch,
any clansmen seen to be still alive
is either slit in the throat, pistolled through the head
or bayonetted and trampled on until, in the words of an eyewitness,
"the moor was covered with blood"
"and our British soldiers looked less like Christian men"
"than so many butchers."
What about some grub?
This rebel host has been most deeply indebted to the public for all the rapine, murder and cruelty and our men are heartily determined to give them receipt in full.
Cut him!
Cut him, you bastard!
Take him to the shoulder!
I'm letting my regiments of horse loose after the battle in order they may have some sweets with all their fatigue.
Thus nearly 100 people are to be butchered or maimed
on the road to Inverness.
Butchered whether or not they took any part in the battle.
They took my baby.
He's only two weeks old.
And one of them whirled him around by his leg... and threw him on to the ground.
This is Jean Clark, aged 28.
Cut about the face and body by sabres,
she was left lying for dead on the road to Inverness.
The soldiers came in and caught him, and Daddy too but I got away through a hole in the wall.
- How old was your brother?
- Lachlan was nine.
I don't... I don't know where he and Daddy are now.
Come on, you!
4 pm. Inverness.
James Rae: trooper,
Kingston's Light Horse,
the first man of Cumberland': army to enter the Highland capital,
the first man to show its inhabitants
what is to be expected from an Englishman
protecting his liberty and his Protestant religion.
There was these two men, shouting and screaming.
And then he came out and there was blood on his hands.
These troopers from the Duke of Kingston's Light Horse Regiment
are later to be commended by Cumberland
for their "zeal in the pursuit."
Each of them comes from Nottingham.
Each of them by trade is a butcher.
James Rae himself, who, like the other troopers of Kingston's Light Horse,
played his pan in the battle when it was over,
is later to return to Nottingham,
where his regimental colours are to be laid to rest
with great pomp and ceremony.
"To the perpetual fame and immortal memory
"of the Duke of Kingston's
Light Horse,
"where, amongst others, on the 16th day of April 1746,
"they performed many and glorious exploits
"in routing and entirely subduing the perfidious rebels.“".
"Long may the county of Nottingham ﬂourish."
"God save our ever august King."
April 16th. 10:30 pm. Inverness.
For William Augustus,
Duke of Cumberland,
third son of King George ll,
an evening of immense satisfaction and triumph.
At the age of 25, he has saved his father's kingdom
and redeemed the reputation of the British army.
At his table, older officers drink his toast and declare him to be
one of the greatest English captains since Marlborough.
His cousin Charles, until today the heroic leader of an armed rebellion,
is now a fugitive in the heather.
If further proof were needed of this young man's prowess,
it is here,
unheeded by him, four and a half miles away.
This is Lachlan MacDonald of Lochaber,
right leg severed below the knee joint.
He's been lying on the moor untended for 13 hours.
For most of the time, it has been raining.
This is Mrs Anne Hossack of Inverness.
Somewhere on the moor, amidst 1,200 dead and dying,
is her husband.
I don't know... where he is.
For Alexander Laing, private,
Barrell's Fourth Regiment of Foot,
this evening is also one of immense satisfaction.
His regiment has acquitted itself with honour on the field of battle.
He himself has despatched three of the rebels
and, above all, he himself has escaped death and maiming.
Lucky bastard!
Battalion will take care while the casualty lists are read.
It's all right for you, my lord!
This is Mrs Anne Walker,
wife of Private Andrew Walker, who was wounded in the ranks of Barrell's
and taken to the surgeons' lines.
This woman, also, has no idea whether her husband is alive or dead.
It is given out this morning of Thursday 17th April that the following officers and other ranks of Major General William Barrell's
Regiment of Foot were either killed or have since died from wounds resulting from the glorious victory inflicted yesterday over the rebel army.
Killed: Captain Lord Robert Kerr.
Other ranks: Sergeant Pullman,
Privates Baker, Barstow, Dyke,
Finch, Lowell,
Lawson, Meecham, Napper, Osbourne,
Smart, Williamson.
Wounded and since died in the surgeons' lines:
Corporal Lockhart,
Privates Davis, Pollock and Walker.
Battalion, take care.
Battalion will dismiss, save for the duty picket.
Battalion, dismiss.
You treated Private Walker a short while ago, Doctor?
Yes... Yes, I did.
What did he die of?
This one? He died of shock, if I remember correctly.
Why was that?
He was an amputee.
I had to take his arm off.
Do you know what... what is our young Billy's pleasure because we fought with such gallantry?
His Royal Highness thanks all ye officers and men for their gallant behaviour.
Get out of it! Leave off!
His Royal Highness releases all ye military prisoners who were this day in custody of the provost.
- Have you heard about the wounded?
- Well, yeh, some talk about it.
They're gonna pay 12 guineas out of the Duke's own purse for all those wounded in the battle.
For Lachlan MacDonald,
who's been now lying on the moor two days with a severed right leg,
there'll be no 12 guineas.
Orders for Friday 18th April 1746.
"A captain and 40 foot to march directly"
"and visit all the cottages"
"in the neighbourhood of the field of battle."
"The officers and men will take notice"
"that the public order of the rebels on the day of battle"
"was to give us no quarter."
Line up the bodies, men.
Come on, quick as you can.
There's another one over there.
The public orders of the rebels to give no mercy to the royal army
do not exist in any other form than a crude forgery
alleged to have been found on the field of battle.
All right, lad.
We're only taking you to hospital.
Bu! Whether he knows this public order is a forgery or not,
Cumberland makes it his excuse to authorize what now happens.
Battalion, present your firelock... at the man in front of you.
Fire!
The officer in charge of this execution squad
is himself a Scotsman.
Captain Scott, are many of the rebels being killed in this fashion?
As many as we can find.
I don't know how many men have been killed in this fashion.
I fear to think.
But just this morning I heard a Campbell officer saying that, in just one area, he himself saw 72 wounded rebels shot or clubbed on the head.
Yes, I saw what was done.
Did you agree with it?
No, of course I didn't.
I will always thank God that I had nothing to do with the black work.
You must try to remember that this is a most difficult problem.
I have talked much with officers from Lowland Scots regiments and they undoubtedly feel that these Highlanders are threatening their culture, their Protestant religion.
They're threatening to disrupt their peace and their commerce.
There's a great feeling of insecurity in the Lowlands.
These people still remember the Highland host.
They still remember the years of cattle thieves and murder, men coming down at night from the hills and extorting blackmail under pain of being robbed.
You see, the Highlander talks a different language.
He wears different clothes... and he undoubtedly has some uncouth and barbaric practices.
For all these reasons,
I think you'll find most Lowlanders hold the man from this part of the country in contempt and hatred.
Much more so even than the English do.
Why is your army treating the prisoners and the wounded like this?
Of yourself, it's been said you're keeping the prisoners in Inverness
without warmth, food and water.
And that you're even withholding medical dressings from them.
Surely this is against all bounds of humanity.
Look, I think the point somewhat eludes you.
These men are rebels and barbarians and as such are to be rated as cattle and treated as cattle.
Get that thing back out the way, please.
For three days and nights since the battle,
these men, many of them stripped of their clothes,
many of them dying from gaping wounds,
have been lying in cold attics and clamp cellars,
awaiting removal to the prison ships anchored in the firth.
The British army authorities
have withheld from them even medical dressings,
thus hoping to solve the acute lack of prison space
by ensuring the mortality rate remains high.
They get no food, no light,
no medical dressing.
Get their headgear while you're about it.
The belt here, too.
The smell in here is terrible.
This man next to me...
I think he's dead.
The way they are treating us, you'd think we were just animals.
Robert MacLean, salmon fisher.
To be tried without defence at an English trial,
of which he is able to understand not a word spoken.
His sentence, execution at York
by being hanged, drawn and quartered.
Check these shackles while you're about it.
Ranald MacDonald, farmer.
To wait in prison 14 months for a trial.
Then sentenced at Brampton to be pulled through its streets on a sled
and hanged, drawn and quartered.
Charles Edward Stuart, believing the Scots to have betrayed him,
refuses to listen to last-minute pleas
to stay and fight in the mountains.
Curtly and without a word of thanks he dismisses the Highland army.
In his saddlebags the last of the Jacobite funds,
which he has now decided to keep for himself,
his need, he estimates, being greater.
Alistair John Stewart,
to lie 10 days in prison, untended, with a broken leg.
To die on the 11th day of gangrene.
John William O'Sullivan, soon to be safely in Rome.
To tell King James of the good part he has played in the rising
and to promptly receive first a knighthood
and then a baronetcy.
Alexander Sutherland, never brought to trial.
Disposal unknown.
Lord George Murray,
who to the end blamed Prince Charles and his Irish administration
for the defeat at Culloden,
is soon to leave Scotland forever, forced to seek exile in Europe.
Prince Charles refuses to see him again and never forgives him,
blaming his opposition to his administration
for the downfall of the Stuart cause.
Bad day for us all, this.
Lord George Murray, estimated by some
as one of the most brilliant generals of the 18th century,
who, if left to his own counsel,
could perhaps have turned Culloden into a victory.
Keep in step, now!
May 23rd. The British army moves to Fort Augustus in the Great Glen.
From here, the centre link in a chain of forts and garrisons
stretching from Inverness in the east to Tobermory in the west,
from Bernera in the north to Dumbarton in the south,
the Duke of Cumberland mounts what he terms,
"the pacification of the Highlands."
Patrol of Bligh's, you will proceed on police action to Lochaber, with sufficient rations for two days.
All right, lads. Fall out and pick up your firelocks.
Move it!
Lord Sackville, what is the function of these patrols.
Their function is to march deep into the glens occupied by the rebels and their families and there, by vigorous police action, ensure that never again will these people disturb the peace of our land.
May 30th. A military patrol under Lord George Sackville
strikes deep into a corrie in Lochaber,
searching for fugitive rebel families.
This is one of them,
sheltering from the rain 1,500 feet up the side of a hill face.
Andrew McEachan, aged 25,
who stood at Culloden, and who now, because of the patrols,
has to hide in the hills like an animal.
This is his wife, child and a friend called Mrs MacInnis.
They have each been out in the open for the past eight days.
This girl is suffering from severe ﬂux
as a result of damp clothes.
The last meal this baby ate was a small fish caught yesterday
and shared between the children.
This little girl, forced to leave her home suddenly,
has only a thin dress, a damp shawl and no shoes.
At approximately 12 noon, May 30th,
the family is sighted by the patrol.
This is what happens.
Right, then!
NO! No!
I dunno.
All these officers keep telling us these people up here are a load of savages, but...
I dunno, they looked like ordinary women and children up there to me.
I didn't like it, what We did.
I didn't like it at all.
Look, let me tell you something.
I had a mate at Falkirk.
He had his head split open.
Like that.
So don't try and make me go all weeping, like, over what happens to these bastards. Eh?
Just don't try it!
Well satisfied with the result of his military occupation,
Cumberland is to leave
Scotland on July 18th.
He leaves behind him, to finish the destruction of the rebel clans,
not only an immense concentration of English and Lowland troops,
not only the zealous help of all the Whig clans,
but even the help of the chief of a rebel clan, Ludovick Grant,
son of the Gram clan chief,
who has hastily reorganized his loyalties
and just delivered 82 of his own rebel clansmen to Cumberland
for transportation to the Barbados,
as proof of his unswerving allegiance to the Crown.
Cumberland himself is to receive from London a tumultuous welcome.
From the Government, a raise in salary of £25,000.
From George Frederick Handel a choral work,
See The Conquering Hero Comes.
From the public, his name for a ﬂower, Sweet William.
From the Scots, his name for a weed, Stinking Billy.
Month after month, the British army patrols
scour every hill range and glen of northern Scotland
in an attempt, as Cumberland puts it,
"to wear down this generation until there be peace in the land.“".
The patrols leave behind them a trail of brutality and suffering
that is to earn for their commander undying loathing
and the epithet
Cumberland the Butcher.
These three of his officers have already burnt, smashed, raped,
looted and bayonetted their way from Glenurquhart to Moidart,
committing, in the name of pacification,
the worst atrocities in the history of the British army.
Captain Caroline Frederick Scott,
Lowlander.
I agree with the senior staff officer, who has proposed that £5 be paid for the head of every rebel brought to Fort Augustus.
Major lain Lockhart, Lowlander.
Those found in arms are ordered to be immediately put to death and the houses of those who abscond are plundered and burned, their cattle drove, their ploughs and other tackle destroyed.
Lord George Sackville, Englishman, third son of the Duke of Dorset.
We have detachments in all parts of the Highlands.
The people are deservedly in a most deplorable way and must perish, either by famine or by the sword.
A just reward for traitors.
We hang or shoot everyone that is known to conceal the Pretender, burn their houses, take their cattle.
The Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart,
object of the largest single manhunt in British history,
now disguised as an ordinary clansman,
much addicted to the little bottle he carries in his hip pocket,
suffering from dysentery,
is to spend the next five months
scrambling amidst the rocks and hills of the Western Highlands,
sheltered by its people, who remain loyal to him and never betray him,
until, in September, he takes a ship for France and security,
leaving behind him nothing,
nothing but a legend,
"Bonnie Prince Charlie."
My bonnie moorhen
My bonnie moorhen.
Up in the grey hill
Down in the glen.
Charles Edward Stuart, the “bonnie moorhen, “
is to walk out of the lives of the people he has led into so much suffering
with scarcely a backward look in their direction.
The year of the Prince had ended
but for the English Government, this was just the beginning.
Systematically and with clue parliamentary legislation,
they proceeded to eliminate ail the things that made this man unique
and that gave him the strength they so feared.
They penalized the wearing of his Highland dress,
penalized the weaving of his Highland tartan,
penalized the worshipping at his Church,
penalized the carrying of his weapons,
penalized the playing of his music.
They removed the authority of his chief
and, in one blow, smashed forever the system of his clan.
They then encouraged his chief to lose interest in him,
to evict him and to replace him by the more profitable sheep.
Thus they reduced him to a homeless, unwanted oddity
and finally forced him, in his hundreds of thousands,
to leave the land of his birth
for the canning industries of the North,
for the disease-ridden slums of the South,
for the lumber camps of Canada
and the stockyards of Australia.
And wherever he went,
he took with him his music, his poetry,
his language and his children.
"On an April morning.
"I no longer hear birdsongs
"or the lowing of cattle on the moor.
"I hear the noise of sheep and the English language,
"dogs barking and frightening the deer.“".
Thus, within a century from Culloden,
the English and the Scottish Lowlanders
had made secure forever
their religion, their commerce,
their culture, their ruling dynasty
and, in so doing, had destroyed a race of people.
They have created a desert
and have called it "peace."
- [Man] Alice.
- No.
- Alice, wait a minute.
- No.
- Wait a minute.
- Don't touch me.
- What's the matter with you?
- [Sighs]
Just how stupid do you think I am?
What are you talking about?
You know perfectly well what I'm talking about.
You've really got me foxed. Really.
Just look into what you've been doing.
- Okay. Cut out all the double-talk.
- Ha!
- What's so funny?
- You're funny, Freddie.
You're a very funny man.
You've got me foxed. Really.
Why don't you just go away.
Why don't you just get out of my life permanently.
- Oh, stop acting, will ya? I mean, cut -
- Don't touch me.
Come on, Alice. Stop acting.
No. I said don't touch me. Please.
Don't ever touch me ever again. Ever.
You know, you're really acting quite impossible.
- I'm not a mind reader, sport.
- I wish I were.
I wish I knew what goes on in that screwy little brain of yours.
How come you think that everybody in the world is stupid except for you?
Boy, you're really talking in circles.
How much of a phony can you be?
Listen. I don't have to stay here and listen to all these hysterics.
You don't even have the courtesy to tell me what this is all about.
I'm a woman.
- And?
- I'm a woman... and not a fool, Freddie.
I know what goes on around me.
I watched you, and I watched him.
- Him?
- Him. Yes. Him.
Some little faggot boy that half the world knows about.
What are you?
Some kind of nut or something?
- You haven't changed.
- [Man] Alice, just believe in me.
You just had me conned. Believe in you?
How the hell can I believe in you?
You've been killing my babies one right after the other.
- Look. I said that I want- I want children too.
- Ever si… - Ever since we've been married...
I've had abortion after abortion.
My-
Look. I want babies too.
Can't you believe that?
I just want to have a child
when things are right between us. That's all.
- Right between us.
- Yes. Right between us.
Right between us.
Right. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Sure.
All right.
Then why don't we have a baby?
Hmm? Let's have a baby.
Well, uh -
You can -
You mean just like that?
Yeah. Yeah. Let's have a baby.
Well, uh, it's not the time.
That is a cop-out, you faggot.
You - Do you -
Do you know what you're doing?
You keep -You keep saying these things to me -
All right? About faggot.
You're projecting, Alice... because you're trying to - to see things in me that you see in your own self.
- Bullshit.
- Oh.
You're just turning everything around to suit yourself.
You just don't want any responsibilities.
You don't want any wife.
- That's all part of your fantasy.
- You don't want marriage. You don't want children.
- It's part of your fantasy that -
- You just want the gay world, Freddie.
G-A-Y! Right? Huh?
- The going gets a little tough -
- Shh! Look, you -
- A little too tough and you run off.
- Shh!
- Fuck you!
- [Microphone Feedback]
- If you're gonna talk that way-
- Speaking of "fuck"... how we've been making love lately, we're never gonna have any babies.
- And that's the way you want it.
That's the way you want it.
- Fuck you!
- [Chattering]
- [Microphone Feedback]
[Man] But, uh, let me hear your-your-
your- Let me hear the sound.
[Feedback Continues]
[Feedback Continues]

This is terrible.

That's dreadful.

- This one goes -
- What -What - Maria, what are you doing?
- Okay.
- No. This one -Where does this one go?
Uh -
- Maria is, uh - if I may use the expression -
- [Man] 5.6 now. Yeah.
- Is, uh, plugging me in.
- [Man] Yeah. So I see.
Why don't you people get to work?
Roland, where does this one go?
My hair right at a -
Okay. Now then.
You were telling me the name of the game is sexuality.
Uh, yeah.
Uh, the important thing is... that I wanted to make sure that, uh, everything that happens... on the set -
I mean, whether it's off- off camera, or whether it's among the crew... or whether it's, uh, being shot, it ha -
- Thematically, I mean, we should be constantly relating to, uh, sexuality. The sexuality-
- [Man Speaks, Indistinct]
- [Chuckles] But anyway, the point is that, um-
- [Man] What'd you say?
Oh, here's that woman with the tits.
Hey. Hey.
- There's - Right down there. Get her.
- [Man] She's a little too far away.
Yeah. No. She's coming. She's coming.
All right. All right.
She's there now.
They're bouncing, chaps.
Oh.
- [Man] Oh, Greaves, you're a dirty old man.
- [Greaves] No. I was just kidding. L-
No. Don't take me seriously.
Um, but anyway, uh, Terry... your-your job is that you're the, um - the, um...
the person that is
in charge of filming... this film being filmed.
Okay? Hey. Where's the switch on this goddamn thing?
If sometimes we-you see us in trouble,
then you come and help us out.
- You know what I mean?
- [Terry] Right.
Uh, but otherwise, uh, like the -
- If you see cars going by, you can integrate that into the general action if you want to.
- Mm-hmm.
- Or an old lady walking a dog.
Here's an old lady.
- [Man] I don't understand.
- Over here.
- What did you- Who's supposed to be
in charge of the actors, filming the actors?
- You and I are gonna be filming the actors.
The two of us -
- [Terry] Don't come into my shot.
Are gonna be filming the actors, uh, continuously.
You're gonna be filming me and the actors,
and I'm gonna be filming the actors.
And Terry is gonna be in charge
of filming the whole thing. You see?
<u>Um, and I'm saying to him that if he sees the two
of us in trouble, then he'll come and help us.
We're gonna start in another two minutes.
Uh, we're just waiting for Pat.
[Chattering]
Want to make sure we start with a fresh magazine.
Cameras should start with fresh magazines.
- Okay. Fine. That's a good idea.
- I'm gonna short-end this.
- What's your exposure here?
- You're - In the shade here, wide open.
No. I'm sorry. What's your-
How much footage have you -
I don't know.
The footage counter's busted on this.
The footage counter's -
How long you been shooting?
I'm not out, but I'm not sure how much more
I have, so I want to start with a fresh magazine.
- Right. Uh, Bob.
- [Bob] Yeah.
- Uh, can he have another magazine?
- We got one. My assistant - My trusty assistant -
- You changing magazines?
- [Greaves] Another magazine.
- [Man] I gotta change magazines.
- [Greaves] Well, where is he?
Where are the people?
[Bob] We got three guys standing here.
You gotta pick it up.
If he wants another magazine,
somebody's gotta get it.
- That's one of mine.
- [Woman] He's got one.
- [Bob] He's got one?
- He's camera "B."
- I don't wanna start this. He's gonna do a big scene.
- He wants another magazine because he's already-
- [Bob] Another magazine for Larner.
- I got a magazine, you blooming idiot.
- You got a new magazine?
- [Bob] Oh. Never mind!
- Never mind. It's here.
- [Laughing]
- Are we ready?
- Who says this isn't an efficient crew?
[Chattering]
[Boy]
Wave.
Really. I know you're looking for a new star, a new face -
[Chattering]
- Let me introduce myself.
- [Laughing]
[Indistinct]
- [Chattering]
- All right. All right.
I am so cute.
Oh! I got it all. Really. Oh, wow.
Okay. All right. Let's - Let's go.
- [Chattering]
- Um -
Ladies and gentlemen, uh, can we ask you to be -
- [Chattering]
- Ladies, uh, uh, uh -
Look. Uh, we don't mind you watching, but, please, you have to - you have to cooperate with us and be very, very quiet, okay?
- Okay.
- Because otherwise, you know... the sound system doesn't hear the actors.
So if you would just -
We don't mind you watching... and we've already got you on film, so you're gonna be famous, but, uh -
- [Girl] What picture?
- [Girl #2] What picture? So we can watch it.
- Huh?
- What picture?
It - It, uh - It's a picture that's coming out, uh, next year sometime.
- [Boy] Aw, I'll be dead by then.
- No. You won't be dead.
- But anyway-
- What's the name?
[Greaves]
Well, the name right now is Over the Cliff.
- Over the Cliff.
- The name of the picture right now is Over the Cliff...
- but it may be changed.
- [Girl] Lady gonna jump off a cliff?
No. No. We're jumping off a cliff.
<u>Uh, anyway, the point is this: That, uh-
Be very, very quiet, and you can watch
from over there. Okay?
- Thank you.
- Okay.
- [Man] All right.
- [Greaves] Relax, Bob.
Bob, relax. Relax.
[Man]
All right. But wait a second. You want to start-
Bob, there's a policeman there.
- Yeah?
- Can I see it, please?
- [Bob] Permit. Permit.
- [Greaves] Permit. Who has the permit?
Wait a second. I gotta get it.
[Greaves]
<u>Um, where's, uh, Don Fellows?
Get up.
[Clicks Tongue]
[Indistinct]
[Greaves]
Oh. Oh. I see.
- Okay?
- Yeah. Let me just -
Take One Productions.
Take the number, and I'll show you the location.
Yeah. We're gonna be shooting in the park during weekdays all next week.
Yeah. Just so we have, uh -
All right.
The number of the permit is, uh -
Damn. You get up there.
- Hey. Do you mind being on camera?
- No. Not at all.
Okay. And here's the location that we're shooting on right now.
Sixty-eighth Street off Central Park West.
8/2, right?
- So we have it on the - on the schedule.
- Just so I got that information.
Sure. Fine. Thanks a lot.
What kind of movie - picture you making?
What kind?
Um, well, it's a feature.
It's a feature-length, uh-
It's a feature-length, uh, we don't know.
- [Chuckles] You don't know.
- It's a feature-length "we don't know."
Yeah. Right.
We'll find out after we develop it.
[Greaves] The tentative-
The tentative title of it is Over the Cliff.
- Over the Cliff. You gotta find that cliff now, huh?
- We've got it. This is the cliff.
- This is the cliff?
- This is the cliff.
Who named it? I think Terry-
Where's Terry?
- You're the one that named it.
- Right.
- Did you say Over the Cliff?
- [Terry] Yeah. Right.
- [Greaves] All right.
- [Bob] Good-bye.
[Terry]
Bye, governor.
[Greaves] "Bye, governor." You fucking idiot.
He says, "Bye, governor."
[Greaves]
<u>Um... could you go down in there and get a shot of her sitting on the statue?
And -And Don will come up and, uh -
- Terry's still shooting, huh?
- Start the scene from there.
Follow me?
Okay. So go -You go down there.
This statue here. The Civil War.
[Woman]
Where do you want me to stand?
Go with you, Terry?
- Terry, are you running?
- [Terry] Yeah.
[Chattering]
[Indistinct]
We're gonna take it.
- Cold turkey. We're gonna get this cold turkey.
- [Bob] You want Don?
- Don stays there?
- [Greaves] Don stays there.
This is, uh, 13.
- [Greaves] Did you slate it?
- Yes.
[Greaves]
Okay. Action!
All right. Clear out of the way here.
Clear out of the way.
- Nicky, you come back this way.
- [Man] I got you.
- [Greaves] Behind me.
- [Man] All right. We got it.
Alice.
- Alice. Wait -Alice. Here.
- No.
Now wait a minute. No. Come on.
Wait a minute. Wait. What?
- No.
- Come on. Come on. Please.
- Look.
- Get your hands off me.
Will you -Will you please tell me what's bugging you?
- Hmm?
- Just how stupid do you think I am?
Look, Alice.
What are you talking about?
- [Indistinct]
- [Greaves] Stop here.
[Man]
Come on, fellas.
No. Please tell me, uh, uh, what the problem is.
Why-Why are you acting so funny?
[Greaves]
Jonathan, you've gotta come on this side.
You're funny. Real funny, Freddie.
[Greaves]
Stop. Stop.
You're really a very funny man.
[Greaves]
Let's get the crew out, please.
You know, you - you really have me foxed.
Why don't you just get out of my life, Freddie, huh?
Just get out permanently, once and for all and forever.
Oh. Oh, now, come on.
- Look. Will you stop acting?
- Take your hands off me.
- Well, stop acting.
- Take your hands off me.
You know, you're acting absolutely impossible. I'm not a mind reader.
[Alice] Boy, I wish I were.
I sure as hell wish I were a mind reader.
[Don] It'd be actually- It'd be nice if we could
have a little more time to walk into it.
- This is what I'd like to do.
- [Greaves] I don't want you to- to get into-
- No. If we're going to look as if- as if I've been following her in the park for 20 minutes -
- Right.
- I'd like to get about 20 feet beyond her-
- Sure. Fine.
- And then run up and catch up with her-
- Yeah.
So on my first "Alice" it's like the first conversation
I've had with her in half an hour.
- Right.
- So it just depends on about where you want, uh -
- That to commence. That dialogue to commence.
- Yeah.
- By the edge of the grass?
- I - I would - Somewhere in here. Okay?
Um, what's happening is that, uh, we're getting too much of a clutter, you know, of people -
- [Woman] Am I walking too fast?
- [Greaves] Yes. I think you are.
Don't get, uh, behind them.
You know, don't get -
Stay- But stay- stay behind the camera.
If you could, uh - If you could take it -
If you could take it slower-
- See, I have a feeling -
- I mean, pull away from him.
- I have the feeling, you see, that she is going home.
- Right.
- And that's it. She's going home.
- Right.
- And she's, like -You know, she's moving.
- All right. Then look.
So what I'll try to do is walk slow but look like I'm walking fast.
I don't know how to do that, but -
[Greaves]
You know, you've really gotta stop her. Yeah. Uh-
[Terry] I hate to tell you guys.
You're shooting in such a black thing...
that you're not gonna get anything.
- What -What have we got?
- Well, I can see it. You're either f/1.5 or 1.2.
- F/2?
- 1.2. And you have a 2.8 lens. So-
[Greaves]
Yeah. Um-
I think it'll be rather- rather- rather underexposed.
[Greaves]
All right. Um-
[Man]
Camera "B" and "C" are both rolling...
but, uh, there are no slates for this.
[Bob] Personal note
from Mr. Rosen to the assistant editor.
<u>Uh, the reason why
all these slates are so fucked up...
is because they're not sure whether or not
the action counts more or the slates count more.
And so sometimes you get the slates,
and sometimes you get the action.
So have fun, bubbe.
[Audio Tape Rewinding]
- [Chattering]
- [Bob] All right.
We just had a jam in a magazine. Cut.
- [Man] First marker.
- [Woman] Speed.
- [Chattering]
- [Terry] Second stock.
[Bob]
You think it's the stock?
- [Terry] I'm just worried-
You know, you do get to know-
- [Man] How's yours?
[Woman]
Roll jam.
- Are you rolling?
- [Man] Yeah.
- [Man #2] Rolling. Go ahead.
- Roll "X" 1.
- [Woman] This is the third slate.
- Right.
- [Terry] What were you saying, Bob, on all this?
Well, we're just sitting around here and, um... we're just gonna rap a little bit about the film.
- Um -
- [Man] All right. Well, maybe we should-
And we'll -
You know, we'll get into it.
And when we get into it, you know, uh, the people out there will understand.
You know, they'll catch on. And, um, you know, we'll explain it as we go along.
Okay. But I think maybe we should say
just exactly how-how it occurred to us... to be here this way...
- uh, without the director-
- [Bob] Right.
Uh, without the actors, um... and in something which, uh... we know is not - is not a part of the film, at least not as far as we know.
Well, we were sitting around the other night, and we - and in talking, a few of us - we realized that here is a - here is an open-ended film...
with no plot that we can see,
with no end that we can see...
with an action that we can't follow.
We're all intelligent people.
The obvious thing is to fill in the blanks...
to create for each of our own selves...
a- a film that we understand.
And if we try to think about
the reasoning of the director...
for allowing us
the opportunity to do this... giving us the circumstances that enable us to be able to sit here... we can only conclude - at least we did last night - that he wanted it like this.
[Larner]
Terry, why don't you cut? I'm holding-
- [Bob] What?
- [Terry] Don't run two cameras. For God's sake.
- [Larner] 'Cause you can't get it.
- [Terry] Please, Steve. Just let one person run it.
[Larner]
Give me a tail slate then, please. Thank you.
- [Terry] Please. Let's just run one camera at a time.
- Okay. Now the thing is... we were sitting around, and we were talking about this, and it just happened.
You know, just like that.
Because there we were, and we were talking.
Just -There were, like, five of us.
Five of the members of the crew.
That's all the people, you know - all the people who are sitting here right now... you know, are members of the crew.
You know, the director does not know that we are photographing, you know, this scene.
We're doing it on our own.
And we were sitting there, and it occurred to us... while we were trying to figure out what the film was about... you know, that we should be filming this.
- [Terry] He wants us to help him make a film.
- Right. Because we're really the only people... who are in a position, so far, to be able to comment, you know, about the film... because the director, Bill Greaves - he is so far into, you know, making the film that he has no perspective.
And if you ask him,
"What is the film about?" you know... he just gives you some answer that's just vaguer than the question.
I mean, that just is so vague that you - that it, you know - that... it'd be better if you hadn't asked the question in the first place.
And if you ask the actors what they think the film is about... all they can tell you is what they thought of the lines that they were reading, you know.
They're just plugged in to just one line.
So if there's a line like "Come on, sport," you know, "Give me a chance" - you know, some banal piece like that... they can say,
"Well, I didn't think that line was good.
"I mean, I would have, you know -
I would have liked to - to have read it differently with a different line."
So they really don't know what's happening either.
Now we've been working on this thing for, like, four days.
And we've all been, you know, more or less, uh, near where the action was taking place.
So we are the only people who can really sort of function like a chorus, you know... to figure out what we're actually doing here.
[Terry]
I think it's our obligation to function.
I think that this point has
been well established now.
[Bob]
Right.
Um, uh, the question was asked to me this morning, as a matter of fact -
I believe, uh, Phil... uh, you asked me something about what -what did I think about what was gonna happen tonight?
- When we stood outside over by the truck?
- [Man] Tonight?
Yeah. And I told you to save it till tonight.
You had some opinions.
What were your opinions about Bill Greaves?
Well, number one, I don't -
Uh, he doesn't know how to direct.
He's into blocking.
That's all he does.
He sits down, and he gives movement.
Um, after reading about something about what his film is based on... he's not doing anything which he - he has put down on paper.
There's no communication between him and the actor-
[Man]
Have you read the presentation plus the script?
- Uh, yes.
- [Man #2] Oh, so you know-
- So you know more about
what's in his mind than, say, I do.
- Maybe. Yes.
- From a technical point.
- [Man #1] Has he talked with you?
- No, he hasn't.
- [Bob] Huh.
[Man #2] What is-
Instead of looking at it this way-
Instead of- Instead of, uh, commenting
on the goodness or badness of Bill's direction... maybe it would be more useful to talk about how interesting the non-direction is.
Because, you see, it doesn't make any difference at this point whether Bill's direction is good or bad.
Bill's direction has enabled us to sit here and talk like this - has compelled us even to be interested this way.
And so it's really his non-direction that interests us.
Right. Let's make one thing clear.
I mean, before we go any further.
I mean, this is a note, you know, sort of to Bill.
You know, when you watch this, Bill.
And to anybody else out there who may be watching it too... if he decides to put this into the film -
Um, we are not trying to take the film away from Bill Greaves.
- [Man #2] No. But for two hours we are.
- [Woman] I disagree.
Well, for two hours. All right.
But he's got the choice to, you know - uh, to edit any- this stuff any way he wants.
So, uh -
So we're not, you know -We're -
- It's - It's not like we got together to rape the director.
- [Man #2] Right.
- All right?
- I disagree.
- You think we are doing that?
- No. I think that the basic premise is wrong... because I think that a director's film... is - is his mind, photographing the world.
And I think if you say... that you're gonna show him what's in his mind or what ought to be in his mind...
then- then you're-you're taking away
a director's film from the director.
- [Bob]
But he doesn't have to use any of this footage.
- [Woman] He doesn't.
- But to clarify the action.
- [Chattering]
[Man #1]
The word used was "rape."
[Terry]
I think the thing in our minds is...
we wonder if the director
knows what's in his own mind.
- [Bob] We don't know.
- [Woman] I think we have to
allow him that privilege.
Or I would say that if I were a director,
I would like to be allowed the privilege.
[Man #2] We are not trying to tell
the director what's in his own mind.
I think the director had this in mind.
Don't you see? This is a movie
where the director plays a different role...
it seems to me,
than in other movies.
Here's a director who sets up a situation,
brings a crew of people who can think...
and doesn't tell them what's gonna happen
and does exactly what Phil says.
Let's just take that for what it is
and say that it leads to our participation in it.
- [Bob] Right.
- [Man #2] And in this sense we're not raping Bill...
or- or telling him what's in his mind.
We are doing our function.
- Our function in the film.
- [Bob] That's right.
- [Man #1] Which is what?
- [Man #2] Which is to do
what we're doing. This here.
That -That -
It must have taken, you know... some real great inner need... whether or not Bill is capable or- or cares to articulate it consciously, all right?
That nobody would come up with such a crazy idea for a film.
- [No Audible Dialogue]
- [Greaves] Barbara, wanna move out of there?
What's the situation with, uh- with, uh-
with Roland? I mean, will he always be over-
- [Bob] He's doing the job of three people.
- That's what I want to know because I said -
- He can't do it all.
- No. But if Roland is gonna do the job of three people -
All the magazines -All the magazines should have a piece of tape on them.
Every magazine. All right? And three magazines should be assigned to each camera.
- Yeah. Fine.
- All right? And on the piece of gaffer tape on the magazine...
- you write what roll number you're at.
- Right.
If it goes back to Roland and lies around somewhere, he'll know which one it belongs to.
Yeah. But what I'm suggesting now is that Roland be put in charge of all equipment.
- And not-
- And not, uh -Well, wait a minute.
- Who's gonna do your thing?
- Um -
No. All right. Uh, what we'll have to do is have
Roland in charge of equipment in the mornings.
Before we come and see that everything's sorted out.
- Yeah. Once we get everything- Today.
- Yeah. No. I'm just -
- First day. When we get everything sorted out, you won't have any problems.
- We're exploring.
- We're exploring the problems.
- The magazines haven't been marked yet.
- When they get marked you won't have any difficulty.
- Okay. All right.
- [Bob] I don't understand your-
- [Jonathan] All right.
[Bob] I mean,
I understand your unwillingness to -
[Greaves] We can go over here.
Let's take these chairs over here.
[Bob] To change the tape every time you change a magazine.
[Jonathan]
You got a lot of empty reels.
[Bob] We have established that
as a convention for the editing. So-
- Doesn't matter.
- [Man] Otherwise we'll lose time like mad.
- He has to run all that off.
- Unless - Unless... there's something happening that is fantastic, you know... where you do a 10-second magazine change... and you must have that sound guy-
- [Man] I can do that fast.
- All right?
Unless something like that is happening, then - and only then - you know, run on -you know, run a second magazine onto the same tape roll.
- Otherwise, keep them separate. Okay?
- All right. Very good.
What are you doing? Want a slate?
- I'm slated.
- Huh? It is. You want - Hmm?
[Man] We don't need you, Bob Rosen.
We don't need you.
[Woman]
I don't know where you are, mister...
but I do know l- I just want you
to get right out of my life.
You have been killing my babies
one right after the other...
and you want me to believe in you?
All right. Now - Now don't you think that I want to have children too?
All right? But I, uh, uh-
But I want us to, uh-
- uh, to be right before we start having-
- Bullshit! That's a lot of bullshit!
All I've known is I have had abortion after abortion after abortion... ever since we've been married.
And I'm - I'm just putting an end to all of that.
I mean, you've ruined my health because you're sick.
Okay. All right. Fine.
But you're not gonna destroy me.
- Now, Alice-
- Every time you've had sex with me, it's as though you've raped me.
You know, I'm not some kind of a whore that you just go and get your kicks in.
I mean, who wouldn't be cold and frigid... with somebody coming on like a goddamn fucking little Nazi storm trooper?
[Don]
Lookit, l-
All right. Uh, okay.
- [Man] This is a pretty long scene, isn't it?
- [Man #2] No kiddin', dad.
Wow. You're gonna have to have
movement in sections too unless-
- Well, I - I guess not when you shoot like this.
- Well, yeah. No, uh -
'Cause I was thinking in terms of light setups and everything else.
The important thing -
The important thing is that you -
And you can do anything you want.
I mean, because, see, we're absolutely disconnected from everything.
This is the beauty of this kind of shooting.
You don't have to worry about a thing.
You just do your thing.
All of these guys are absolutely geared... to function in terms of the reality that's happening at that moment.
They're not -
They're not in any way, um, uh... dependent, you know, on something being lined up properly.
They'll -They'll get it.
Don't worry about it.
You just go ahead and do, you know, whatever it is that is organic to you... and organic to the moment for you.
You know what I mean?
Well, we'll just do it section by section.
But by the end of the day,
what I would like to do... really, is run the whole thing nonstop, you know.
'Cause I think that you will have committed it.
Don't you think so, Pat?
Right.
[Giggles]
[Greaves] I think if we do it section by
section we'll kill two birds with one stone.
On the one hand we'll be able to make sure that we've got each sequence... to, in a sense, our satisfaction.
Then at the end of the day, well run the whole thing... uh, completely nonstop.
You know, with all the cameras, everything going at once.
And then we'll see what happens? Okay.
[Soft Chattering]
[Chattering Continues]
Alice.
- Alice, wait a minute.
- No.
- Alice, come on. Come on.
- No.
- Come on.
- Don't touch me.
Alice, for Christ's sake, what is eating you?
Boy, just how stupid do you think I am?
What are you talking about?
You know perfectly well what I'm talking about.
I wish - I -
I wish you would just tell me what is... bothering you.
Ha!
- What's so funny?
- You're so funny.
That's what's so funny.
You're really a very funny man.
Alice, uh, you really have me foxed.
Do you know that?
Why don't you just... get out of my life, huh?
Just once and for all, permanently.
Just get out of my life.
Oh, come on.
[Gasps]
Look. Will you stop acting? Come on.
Look. For the last time, will you please tell me what is bugging you?
No. You tell me what is - or better yet who is bugging you.
You're certainly talking in circles.
Am I really?
Am I really?
Well, just how much of a phony can you be?
Look. I don't have to stay here and listen to these hysterics, you know.
You could at least have the courtesy to tell me what is going on.
You know, I've really just put up with your escapades long enough.
I really have.
I've just about had it.
[Dog Barking]
Ye -You -You don't even have the - uh, the courtesy to tell me what's going on.
I am a woman.
[Laughs]
And?
I am a woman, Freddie.
I am not a fool.
And if you think I'm gonna stand around like some idiot... with egg on my face while you play your friggin' games... you've got another thing coming.
What? Uh -
I saw you.
I saw you looking at him... and I saw him looking at you.
- I saw that whole thing.
- H- Him? Wh- Wh-
That's right. Him.
That's right. Him. Him.
A little faggot that everybody knows all about.
Alice, what are you?
Some kind of nut?
Look now. I have put up... with your escapades long enough.
- I mean, I saw you two just -
- [Greaves] Cut. Sorry.
<u>Uh, we- we ran out of film there.
Uh, do you want to, uh -Well.
- Um, what we'll do is, uh, pick it up again.
- All right.
- We ran out of film there.
- All right.
- And then you got the squad car. You got -
- We got the squad car, which is all right.
- There's nothing wrong with that.
- Uh -
- So we'll, uh, pick this up from here.
- Okay.
Um, how do you, uh -
How do you, uh -
How do you feel about the scene since you've, uh, you know...
done it the last time.
I mean, have any thoughts come to mind?
Anything about that -
- Well, I feel I want to - I want her lower.
- Huh?
- I want her lower.
- Lower?
Yeah. I want her, uh - I felt there was -
I was doing too much overacting last time.
And, you know.
- You felt it was too broad.
- I need more - I need more time.
- Yeah.
- I need lots of time.
- And that's why I'm trying to -
- Yeah. Take your time. Okay.
- Just -And I have a tendency to rush.
- Mm-hmm.
- I've always had that.
- Mm-hmm.
- Just plain old insecurity. That's all, baby.
- Oh, listen, honey.
[Don]
Well, you're also conscious of film going. See?
That's the -When you rehearse there's no film, and you suddenly hear... the clickety, clickety, clickety, clickety, clickety, clickety click.
- I don't.
- I do. I sure as hell do.
- How do you feel, uh, Don?
- I'd just like to act better. That's all.
- [Greaves Laughs]
- That's my problem.
Well, uh -
Do - Do you feel that you're more, uh, in just the short -
- Yeah. I feel better.
- Do you feel better, more comfortable about it?
- Uh-huh.
- You feel more involved in the -
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh -
I don't feel more involved. I feel more comfortable.
I would like to get more involved.
It'd be nice to start
all over again if we could...
because that was kind of
rehearsal time, I think.
- [Greaves] Yeah. Okay.
- [Don] And it was-
- Want to run it from the top?
- I was trying to space it
and figure where I'd catch her.
And, uh-
- [Greaves] I would basically play it in this direction.
- Yeah. Okay.
- Is there any danger of stuff
being there but nobody there?
- Listen, Terry.
How about bringing the tripod in a little closer so we can get a little closer look on them?
- But nobody's watching, I don't think.
- I know what you got. I saw -
I saw how close you could get.
- [Terry] I get a full-
more than a full head, you know.
- Yeah. I know.
- Yeah.
- [Faint] But if you came a little closer-
[Jonathan] Ah, there's no mike on Bill, man.
Where's that mike?
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Don]
No, but it's kind of-
It was kind of funny. I -
She kept wanting to get together and rehearse.
And I kept -
And so I'd say, "Okay."
And then we'd have some time, and then she would change it.
So I finally said - "Well," I said,
"Thursday morning we'll get together... and we'll run lines the way you do when you're on a soap opera."
And Pat said,
"I don't do soap operas."
So, it's a good thing to be independently wealthy. That's all I got to say.
A good thing.
- Slate me. All right.
- [Man] Yeah. Please.
Here we go. Go on, Don.
- [Don] What?
- You are being used.
- Oh. As what?
- [Clapping]
- A slate.
- As a slate?
Okay. Now what are we -
What'll I do? What'll I say?
- Why? Are you taping that?
- Sure.
- You dirty rat.
- We tape everything.
Oh, Jesus Christ. Don't you dare.
Oh, that would be unbelievable.
[Bob] The thing is that it's not
like Edward Albee, you know.
- [Terry]Just hold it one second.
- What?
- Four, roll two. Go on.
- Right.
It's not like Edward Albee.
I mean, Edward Albee writes
Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
And George and Martha are superdramatic people... given lines that are brilliant lines.
- [Jonathan] Well, that's good writing.
- Fantastically brilliant -That's right.
- This is not good writing.
- This is bad writing.
This script is not good writing,
and I think that has everything to do with it.
Exactly. We're not in a dramatic bag here.
We're somewhere else.
On the other hand, human life
isn't necessarily well-written, you know.
- Excuse me?
- Human life isn't necessarily well-written.
Right. That's right.
That's the whole point. That's the whole point.
Here we're confronted with one of the ultimate banalities of life.
A pair of actors says this ultimate banality.
Bill has given them these lines to play in the first place... um, and then tells them how to say it... um, and the actors try to find the meaning in it.
Now, I look at it this way.
I see every American man, at some time in his life, saying these lines to every American woman.
Every American woman says it to every American man. And where are we?
Nothing changes.
Nothing is revealed.
And it's almost as if these lines were planted in their heads when they were born... that they when they were three years old that one day they'd say to their wives...
"You're cutting my balls off."
And then every woman knew, when she was a little girl, that someday-
Here's this line in her head -
You're, uh -You're -You're ineffectual.
Some variety of "ineffectual."
- You're a faggot, or-
- [Bob] "You can't allow me to be a woman."
You're a faggot, you're weak, you're this, you're that. It's doomed to happen.
<u>Uh, so, h-h-here's Bill.
He's the director.
And this is the sense- He's the director.
He writes this dialogue and hands it to poor Freddie and poor Alice.
But what -
Yeah, but what throws me... is that he's, in a sense, written himself a part in the film... and as soon as you turn the camera on, he turns on.
- I think I said to you -
- [Woman] Turns off?
Turns on. And he's like a bad actor.
He turns on.
And he doesn't turn off into his natural self till the camera stops.
This throws me every time, because there's Bill throwing lines away-
- [People Speaking Simultaneously]
- But Bill thinks of himself as an actor, you see.
Bill is an actor.
He's gonna protect his actors.
- [Terry] I think Bill is a bad actor...
- That's immaterial.
And somehow he's trying to live out
his actors' lives through this film.
- [Bob] Right. But Bill acts off camera too.
- I know.
- That's one of the strange things about this film.
- He's a better actor off camera than on.
When he comes on to people
and he says, you know- and he says, you know, something like...
"Hello, my boy!
How are you doing? Hmm?
Genius! Beautiful thing you did there!
Fantastic!" You know?
I mean, that's acting.
But this is the way-
- [Laughing]
- [Terry] Bill comes right through that!
[Laughing]
But - But -
But that's the way he does that, and he's acting even then.
It's like somewhere the director is hiding. You know?
And I think he's making this film to get it out into the open... that he has, in some way, some kind of need to find out... where the line of his acting and everybody else's acting, you know -
I mean, where that drops off... where it stops, you know, being - doing -
doing things because-because-
because, um-because a certain-
you know, giving somebody
a certain reaction because it's called for...
because he needs
to get something out of them-
where you pass beyond that line of manipulation
to where you’re just being yourself.
When Bill is himself, he's very, very quiet.
He doesn't do that at all.
[Jonathan]
What does that have to do with this film?
I think this is one of the reasons why he's making the film.
[Greaves]
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on.
We're gonna have a picture, folks.
It's hard to believe,
but it's gonna happen.
Come along. Come along.
Actors, please.
Places, please.
Jonathan? Mr. Larner, your presence
is desperately requested.
<u>Uh, okay.
Listen, are we making a movie,
or are we not?
- Did you get that?
- [Loud Thump]
No.
[Greaves] Incidentally-
Look- Listen- My microphone di-
[Terry]
This is camera "C", roll three.
[Greaves]
Nobody cares.
[Greaves]
Sy's always in the fucking way.
This is the class picture here.
Sy's safari outfit.
Now, what is it you want to know about me?
Well, you wanted to say a few words for George Wallace.
[Laughing]
- Yes?
- I'm s - I was stamping.
Listen, uh, Terry, incidentally... this afternoon, uh, after lunch... we have the camp version of this picture... starring you and Jonathan in the leading roles.
[Man]
Steve, do you need a slate?
Camp version?
I thought that's what I was doing now.
Um -
[Laughs]
[Bob]
Why don't you move it. Move it closer.
- Where am I coming from?
- To my right.
- Yeah. If she says -
- Now, wait a minute. Don is gonna be here.
That's right. That's what always happens to the man - back to the camera.
No, you know there'll be a camera over there.
Isn't there somebody my size who could wear the jacket? I'll phone the dialogue in.
[Laughing]
Oh, these super commercial stars, huh?
[Don] Now, how can I say- That's right.
Now, where's the product that I hold?
Gee, if I don't have a product,
I'm helpless.
[Terry]
That's what she's complaining about.
Okay, now, um -
Every time I try and grab the product, she says, "Don't touch me."
- Listen, man, I'm trying to direct a picture here.
- I'm sorry. Okay.
You're quipping all the time, you see?
We're serious people.
- I know that.
- And you don't realize that.
- All right.
- Now?
- How now, brown cow?
- Speak up.
- Why? What's the matter?
- We're having trouble on her microphone.
- Are you?
- Oh. Well, then we'll change microphones.
- No, no.
- Is that the same mike that -
Same thing. This morning
I thought it was gone, but it's not.
- Let me hear that.
- Is it taped properly?
Is - Is it taped on?
[Maria]
Had the same problem this morning.
[Headset: Static]
How now, brown cow?
Can you hear me?
[Don]
She has a rattling rib cage.
- [Pat] Can you hear me?
- Yeah.
- Like that?
- Turn her off.
[Static Fades]
[Greaves]
All right, let's hear it. Talk to Don.
- How now, brown cow?
- How brown, how now?
This is the way the world runs - ends.
[Pat] This is the way the world ends - not with a bang, but a whimper.
[Don] Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their party.
I - I could play it kinda like this, and then she could talk into my mike.
[Don Snickers]
- [Don] Did you get that?
- [Greaves] Let me speak to you a moment.
- [Don] I'm not sure I wanna speak to you!
- [Greaves Laughing]
[Audio Static]
Listen, um, I think that, uh, that, you know, you had the impulse... to use certain things in relation to her that turn you off.
Do you know what I mean?
You started to move in that direction.
- I'm using her.
- All right, but let's explore it.
Take my cock out and flog her with it.
- All right, but let's - [Chuckles]
- You got that?
No, let's use it much more fully.
Don't inhibit yourself in this area.
Just -Just explore physically what you -
You know the thing that kinda bothers me, that I'm bugged, and that is... that I don't know whether to play physically... uh, a, you know, bisexual, like [Bleep] or-
- [Laughs]
- No, I'm being very serious.
- No, n-n-no names, please.
- Oh, I see.
- I don't know whether to be a little faggy...
- Yes. Right.
Uh, or not.
I have explored the kind of thing... and I don't know whether this is a faggy fag or a butch fag.
Yes.
Whether it's a guy that goes around and says,
"All right, you sons of bitches, you motherfuckers -"
You know, and it turns out he's a fag...
because he's playing the masculinity thing
to such an extreme.
- It's a joke.
- [Greaves] Yeah. Yeah.
So I don't know whether to come in
with the chain and the black boots... or, uh - or to just play it, uh, straight.
[Greaves]
Which would you prefer to play?
Well, in a way, I, um - in a way, I'd like to be a closet fag.
You know, the kind that nobody ever says.
Like there are people that we know who, since I now can't name names.
And you finally say, "What? Come on!"
And you finally discover that it was true.
Yeah. Right. Right.
Well, let's play that.
Let's play that kind of a fag.
- A closet fag. You know.
- [Mouthing Words]
[Don] Well, then I'll just go ahead and I'll just play it straight then.
[Greaves Laughing Loudly]
[Greaves]
Oh, that's too much.
- Okay. All right.
- Terry, I need another sync.
If it's not going well, I'm going to stop it.
Do you know what I mean?
It was going well.
That's all I can tell you.
And I think you just have to, uh, believe... uh, when I tell you that it's going well.
[No Audible Dialogue]
Okay. All right, let's take it on
from this- this point.
<u>Um, Terry?
<u>Uh, we're gonna go on from, uh,
from the point where we were at.
[Greaves] All right, take the freedom
to move around in this general area here...
and let's take the basic situation.
And, um -And, uh, improvise, uh, on that basic situation.
Okay. Kinda the same story line then, huh?
- I think so. And see what happens.
- Okay.
- Oh, we're walking in?
- We're in.
- No, you're already in.
- Oh, we're already in? I'm trying to get in!
That's the problem with the whole scene.
- That's what clutters up the park. Officer!
- [Chuckling] That's true. That's true.
- Where are they when you need them?
- Would you believe that?
And I'm talking about those people throwing -
- Okay.
- You're absolutely right.
- Okay, let's settle down.
- [Pat Coughs, Clears Throat]
I gotta figure out something.
- Were you running-
- All right, I'm gonna try something differently.
Clap.
[Bob] That discussion is a discussion
between Pat and Don.
- [Jonathan] Don, clap your hands.
- [Hands Clapping]
[Bob]
We'll call action.
Are you going home?
[Don Laughs]
- [Pat] From here?
- Yeah.
- [Don] Are you rolling?
- Yeah.
Alice? Come on!
Can't you wait -Wait a minute.
- Wait a minute.
- I can't -
- What?
- Just leave me alone. Okay?
Just leave me alone.
Well, the least you can do is have the courtesy to tell me what's bugging you.
All right? Come on.
You know.
Jesus Christ,
I thought once we get married... you know, you'd change and -
- [Chuckles]
- [Sarcastic Chuckle]
You know, I really don't have any idea what you're talking about, Miss Balls.
[Sighs]
Listen, you skinny little faggot.
I am fed up -
I am absolutely fed up with this shit.
Half the time we go out, wherever we're going...
- you're trying to get with somebody.
- No -All right, give me an -
- Give me an example.
- Or on somebody. I don't know what you boys do.
Give me an example then.
All right?
- You sure as hell don't do anything with me.
- No -
Oh! I what?
- You heard it.
- No, I just wanna hear it again.
- You heard it.
- And who stops me?
- I never stop you.
- L-I can't even get started!
- You stop every-
- That's your problem.
You go see the head shrinker.
- L-I have, haven't I? Right?
- Mmm. Three sessions.
Fine - Oh, no, more than that.
More than you know about.
- Five sessions.
- More than you know about.
And all I can say is, it's about time
you started, 'cause you need it.
Just remember, the person who says the other one is sick is always the sickest of all.
- Ah.
- Ha! You're the fag.
- I am not.
- The fuck you're not, boy.
That's something you keep hanging me with, and I am not.
- The hell you're not.
- I am not. You can't give me one example.
- I just did.
- Oh, no. You said something about today.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
- I talked also about the first year we were married.
- I'm talking about today.
- Chuck, Tim -
- All right, you've already talked about that.
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Tell me about today.
- We already talked about that. That's over with.
- That's right.
Yesterday you were a fag.
Today you're not.
Tomorrow you're just going to fuck the little rabbits or chipmunks here in the park.
How about that, huh?
Why don't you try a mosquito next.
- You are really sick.
- You're damn right I'm sick.
I am sick of you!
- You have got to believe me.
- Okay, let's cut it here.
- [Pat] See? I mean, this is -
- [Greaves] No, no, no, take -
- No, no, no, no.
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- [Pat] Why should I take it easy? Why?
- It's going very well.
It is not, and you know it!
[Don]
No, I think she's upset...
'cause I think she was building toward
the big climactic shooting or something.
[Jonathan]
This is tail slate.
[Man]
<u>Uh, Pat has just slightly flipped out.
<u>Unfortunately, both cameras ran out.
They're changing magazines.
Bill is on. I'm gonna stay with him
till I run out.
[Maria] I was saying that, in a way,
we are criticizing that he doesn't know at times...
what he is doing.
But I think this is what he wants.
This is what he is looking for.
It's a certain experiment.
According to the synopsis... or the idea of the film... it's, uh, a conflict between him and the actors... in a way that he is doing a test screen, or he is doing just one dialogue.
Now, he is experimenting the different ways of directing this same dialogue.
- But why film it?
- No, no, no-
- Well, because the only way he is -
- Why give them lines?
- Well, the only way- He is -Yeah?
- We're saying that-
We're saying that giving them lines-
You give them the lines
and then each one acts it out differently.
In that case, you shouldn't do that.
You should give them a story.
Then they bring out the lines.
Something else will come out of it.
Action is not the problem here.
So what if they're running up a hill or sitting on the bench?
It can be anywhere.
It can be on the moon.
[Jonathan] lf he wanted to do this,
he could do it on a stage.
Or he could just simply do it.
He's actually making a film of this, you know.
It's not merely an experiment.
It's an experiment that's culminating in a film... and that film is not designed for Bill to keep in his basement.
It's a film that's designed to play, to reveal something, to be a work of art.
How, in that sense -
Well, first of all, he can do
a lot of work with these different- with all this footage in the editing room according to how the film is edited... because it's the type of film that you can edit in 300 different ways.
[Maria]
Did you read the concept of it?
No, I didn't read the concept of it, and I don't know whether we ought to bring the concept in... because Bill hasn't mentioned it yet.
[Bob] I read the concept, and the concept
doesn't help you at all. Not one bit.
No, the point is, I don't see where there's a beginning, a middle or an end.
I don't mean in a conventional story fashion.
But everything we shoot is the same rather- let's be frank- indifferent actors.
Sort of- Stage actors, not film actors, so they're all -
Which, as I said, it would be great on Sony videotape. Then you could do a critique.
But I don't see where there's any build in the film at all.
[Larner] Well, now you're getting down
to the nitty-gritty.
- Every situation is new.
- Not bloody much is happening, if you ask me.
- [Barbara] I think there is!
- Tell me. What is happening?
- Excuse me. I've gotta unload myself.
- [Bob] Why don't you think
that there's nothing happening?
- I think that - It seems to me -
- [Terry] You’re just blasting your own parts.
That not having read Bill's concept... it seems to me there's some exploration of the levels of reality... and the supralevels of reality.
So this is even another level of reality that we're establishing here.
It may be the biggest put-on of all time that - that the celluloid -
[Bob] Recognizing the reality or nonre-
Trying to establish that is useless.
For all anybody knows, you know...
Bill is standing right outside the door and he's directing this whole scene.
- [Barbara] That's what I'm saying.
- All right? It could be. Nobody knows.
Maybe we're all acting.
I mean, I'm acting, you know, and that's it.
I mean, I was - Bill could have stood outside of the door and told me...
"Now, Rosen, when you get in there, tell them about this when you get to a certain point."
Nobody out there knows whether or not we're for real.
And what is being revealed?
[Jonathan] My whole point is that
nothing is being revealed... and that's the genius of this film, if there is a genius.
I think the genius of this film was that it was provided that somewhere during its filming... the crew should decide to act as an independent unit... come into a room and talk about this film... and thereby, possibly, to change the end of it.
This was planned, consciously or unconsciously, by Bill.
- [Terry] You believe in God after all.
- [All Laughing]
[Greaves]
Uh-uh-uh. Marvelous. [Laughing]
- [All Chattering]
- Okay, um -
[Pat] You have been killing my babies,
one right after the other...
and you want me
to believe in you?
You come on like a goddamn little Nazi storm trooper.
You just don't want
any responsibilities.
- You don't want any wife.
- [Don] That's all part of your fantasy.
You don't want marriage.
You don't want children.
- The going gets too tough, you run out.
- Shh!
Fuck you!
If you're gonna talk that way-
Speaking of "fuck," boy, how we've been making love lately, we're never gonna have babies.
- That's the way you want it.
- Fuck you!
Alice.
[Sighs]
[Jonathan]
I'm rolling.
See, that's the whole thing - a faggot is not a homosexual.
A faggot is a certain kind of mentality.
And Freddie happens to be a faggot, but not because he may or may not be homosexual.
Because he's a faggot - he doesn't know what he wants. He's, like, a faggot.
This is a very strange thing,
because all I really know is myself... and all I really know are the people I really know.
And I don't know anybody here, except a few, but I really don't know them.
And having -And being forced, in a way, to listen to this sordid conversation -
'Cause you haven't heard it.
You haven't been here for eight days and listened to this sordid, horrible conversation... over and over and over again... with black faces, white faces, tall ones, old ones, young ones, skinny ones.
You know?
Convincing ones, unconvincing ones.
It's, you know - It really-
It does funny things to you.
All right, all right,
so what else can we do?
We've got all this equipment lying around here - Look.
Here's a tripod,
there's two still cameras.
There's three Eclairs, there's an Arri-S.
We've got three Nagras.
We've got an awful lot
of equipment here.
It would be interesting -
It really would be, Jonathan -
It would be very interesting to see you, uh, surface... with a better script.
Y-A-A-And there's no competitive thing -
[Bob] What's a better script? I mean, here's a film,
you know, and you're a director-
No, a better script as a screen test for a pair of actors.
The way to make the script better is to, first of all, drop the euphemisms.
- You talk real language.
- [Greaves] What euphemisms?
The euphemisms.
Freddie says to Alice - He says to -
Freddie has a cock. Alice has a cunt.
Freddie likes or doesn't like to fuck Alice.
Alice can't come. Alice has difficulty coming.
Alice comes easily.
Freddie stays a long time.
Freddie stays a short time.
Freddie stays an intermediate amount of time.
Freddie really loves to fuck Alice.
You know what I mean.
That's the way to talk.
And that's the way people, uh, can liberate themselves to talk about themselves.
[Bob] Right. You have a line here, like,
"Come on, sport, give me a chance."
"Give me a chance."
That doesn't mean anything.
- [Bob] Give me a fuck? Is that what it means?
- [Jonathan] "You never let me touch you."
What does that mean?
"It's unnatural."
What does that mean?
"Don't you like me to eat you, Alice?"
That means something.
Or "Eat me, Freddie." That means something.
You understand? I'm serious.
That is the way the script is transformed from a useless faggotry... from a little semi-annual conceit between two people... to something that never has to be repeated again.
[Greaves] I think there's another level of this,
if you recall, in the original concept.
<u>Um, the, uh- This screen test...
which we are supposed
to be shooting...
um, is unsatisfactory.
- I assume that you read the concept.
- I haven't read the concept.
Well, anyway, the point is this - that the screen test proves to be unsatisfactory... from the standpoint of the actors and the director.
And then what happens is that the director and the actors... undertake to improvise something better...
than that which has been written
in the screen test.
This sort of palace revolt...
[Chuckles]
Which is-no, no-
which is taking place...
um, uh, is not dissimilar... to the sort of revolution that's taking place, let's say, in America today... in terms of the fact that, you know, in a sense, I represent the establishment... and, uh, I've been trying to get you to do certain things... which you've become, in a sense, disenchanted with.
Now, your-your problem is... if you come up with creative suggestions...
which will make this into
a better production than we now have.
I don't understand that at all.
[Greaves] It doesn't matter
whether or not you understand it.
The important thing is that
we surface from this production experience... with something that is entirely exciting and creative as a result of our collective efforts - as a result of Marsha's efforts, as a result of Audrey, Sy Mottel... you, Jonathan, you, Bob,
Roland Mitchell, Nicky...
Frank Baker, Barbara Linden.
It's important that, as a result of the totality of all of these efforts... we, uh, arrive... at a creative... piece of cinematic experience.
[Woman]
I have been
In love but once
Each time as painful as the last
I found out
So many times
How short forever is
[Conversing, Indistinct]
How can you measure love
- If not by pain
- Places!
- [Man] No, no, the microphone.
- [Greaves] The microphone. Okay.
Lovers we could always be
[Larner]
Can you read this? Can you see this?
But friends
beneath the spreading tree
Turn away
Don't follow me
[music] Alice [music]
[Music] No [music]
- [Music] Alice [music]
- [Music] No, no [music]
[Music] Come on, sport [music]
- [Both Chuckling]
- [Greaves] Don't enjoy it so much.
All right, that's okay. That's fine.
It's coming along.
But, um, try to go into the, uh, the situation as you sing.
- Yes. Yes.
- Okay? Go ahead.
- [Music] Alice [music]
- [Music] No [music]
- [Music] Alice [music]
- [Music] No, no [music]
[Music] Come on, sport [music]
- [Music] Come on [music]
- [Music] Don't touch me [music]
[Music] For heaven's sake [music]
[Music] What's bugging you [music]
[Alice] [music] Why don't you tell me who or rather who's bugging you [music]
[Greaves]
No, I can't take that.
- [Laughing]
- Can I ask you a question?
Is that really what they do
at the Actors Studio all the time?
Silence, boy!
No, that's not true.
That's fantastic.
What?
Do you want a slate?
- [Terry] No, that's all right.
- Okay. [Laughing]
That's -
Uh, hold on more securely to the -
uh, to the basic situation
if you can.
[Jonathan] Why are you ask-
Why are you asking them to sing?
Because I'd like to have them sing.
N- No, I know, but I wonder why.
Um, I don't know.
Just, uh -Just an idea.
[Bob] I mean, is it an experiment
in the musical comedy form?
It's an experiment in the musical comedy form.
[Bob Laughs]
He just doesn't want to answer you.
I'm trying to find out if the scene can play with -
There is an acting exercise
that this can be very useful for... which is what we started doing, which is to sing... and therefore bring other elements that your imagination wouldn't have ordinarily gone to.
That's the value.
- But to sit here and try to do a duet, I -
- [Greaves] Right. I quite agree with you.
- It's like we should have an orchestra.
- Yeah, right. I quite agree.
<u>Uh, does that answer your question,
Mr. Gordon?
I think we can use this.
I think, uh... uh, it will end - it will add a... interesting texture to the film.
Doesn't anybody think so?
- [Laughs] Nobody thinks so?
- [Bob] You want to call it a texture?
Well, you can see the comments
right on their faces.
Just pan over and look at that.
[Laughing]
[Jonathan]
I don't think it works. Sounds terrible.
You're too kind.
There's no sense of reality
in this, uh-
There's no sense of reality.
I mean, who goes about singing to each other?
[Man]
What is this thing?
I spoke with you yest-
You're from Canada, right?
Oh, it's a movie.
So, who's moving whom?
Merci beaucoup.
Oh, you got a big lens in there.
- [Greaves] Isn't that French?
- You ain't got a cigarette?
[Man]
No, it's not. It's Jewish.
- I thought it was French.
- No, it's Jewish, darling.
- Really?
- Very Jewish.
I'm a Polack, and that's Jewish.
Hello there, darling.
Let me see how you look. You look pretty good.
- My name's Victor Vikowski, darling.
- [Greaves] Um, Bob -
What is this? ABC camera?
Hello. My name is Victor.
How do you do?
- [Greaves] Somebody-
- Pleasure to meet you.
- I do watercolors.
- [Bob] Somebody get a release for this gentleman.
But they threw my ass out nine weeks ago.
I've been living in the bushes.
Do you know why?
Because I couldn't pay two weeks rent.
I was paying $45.70 a week... and I couldn't make the scene.
Terrible!
All my watercolors, my paintings, my brushes are more important than them F-in' things -
You know what "F" is?
I coined that phrase.
- What is this?
- You know - "fuck."
- Yeah?
- That's -Well, you never knew what that meant?
- I know.
- You don't know.
Are you such a virgin like I am?
[Laughing]
We're not virgins, baby.
We're virgins in the brain, if you wanna be that way.
Yeah, but why do we have to have adaptation of words and symbols?
Can't we be ourselves?
You wanna go get fucked, get fucked.
That's all. That's the way I think.
Wanna suck?
Suck, goddamn it!
Everybody sucks -What? I -
Didn't you suck your mama's nipples first?
Well, I did the same thing, you know.
What, you're so different than I am?
No.
And then it goes on and on... as a prospectus of life, you see.
It's -
[Coughs]
You'd be tired here, nine weeks in these bushes.
It's terrible.
It's a monstrosity.
- Where are the watercolors? In the bushes?
- Honey, darling, they're not in the bushes.
They're at Brenton Hall Hotel on 86th Street, south -
Do you live here in the park?
What do you think?
I made a jerk out of myself there?
But that's all right.
At least I cleaned my mind a little bit.
'Cause I hate bullshit, you know.
I dislike it.
I'm sorry. I'm not being vulgar.
Not at all.
- That does not impress anything upon -
- You going home? Going -
You're a lady- But you're still a lady.
I'm a lady too, and a man. We're both the same.
But going around in the park, you've sort of become a philosopher, haven't you?
No, I educated m -
I went to Columbia for four years.
- Did you really?
- Damn right I did.
- What did you study there?
- Bachelor science, Bachelor art.
- I went to Parsons School of Design.
- Oh, I see.
- You're, what, a scene designer?
- Architectural designer.
- Architectural designer.
- Yes.
- I'm an alcoholic, by the way, too.
- Well, listen, uh -
Well, I am. I admit it.
I'm trying to make some pints for myself for tonight.
- Well, let's see. Maybe -
- It gets cold out here, baby.
And when you live alone, baby, you need something warm -
- You don't sleep here at night, do you?
- Sure I do. I get in the bush.
But the rain fuckin' drove my ass outta there.
Are there many people who sleep here at night in the park?
There's an enormous amount of human beings here.
- Sleeping here in the park at night?
- Of course.
- Did anybody know this?
- [Bob] No, I didn't know that at all.
- You're full of shit. You must have known.
- I never knew that.
I live off 70th Street off the park.
I have never seen anybody asleep in the park.
- Don't the police bother you?
- No.
Lindsay-
Listen, let me tell you what happened.
Lindsay made a speech today-
Merci beaucoup, s'il vous plaît.
- Wait. He has to sign this, uh -
- Lindsay made a speech today.
And I thought I'm going to Versailles again, you know. 'Cause I've been there.
- Sir-
- And he's bullshitting the propaganda.
You know how politics work.
Do you, uh, object to being on Candid Camera?
I don't give a shit where I am.
I'm in life anyway.
You'll have to sign the release.
[Pat] This better not be Candid Camera
after all the work I did!
I got a fuckin' name that's so long, goddamn it, you'd better have a paper long enough.
Write it as long as it takes.
As long as it takes. That's it.
Right.
- Wait, I'm not - I just thought of it.
- That's just the first one.
- Okay. All right?
- [All Laughing]
And I eliminated the middle part.
- Okay?
- [Maria] That's what you sign
on your paintings?
- Wow!
- Yes, I do.
- [Maria] Yes?
- [Bob] Fantastic.
And your address is where in the park?
- 69th Street. I love 69th Street.
- 69th Street in the park.
You're gonna put that down as your address?
Come on, baby!
We'll go in the bushes!
- Is there a number on a bench or-
- Sixty-nine. No number. Sixty-nine is enough.
- Sixty-nine is enough?
- What else you want?
- Eighty-sixth? That's another number.
- Can we find you here anytime?
I mean, any night during the summer at 69th Street?
I hope I'm out of here when winter comes, when the leaves fall.
- [Man Chuckling]
- Oh, baby, I gotta move.
- [Maria] Where do you move in the winter?
- Who the hell knows?
[Greaves] Are you saying that hippies are sort of confirmation of what you, uh -
What I was 20 years ago, and they called me an asshole and everything.
Because we need changes.
We all need money, true... but when you have to live off someone else's fucking back to make that buck-
That's the penis of a dollar.
I call it the penis of a dollar.
What do you mean, living off of somebody else's back? How do you mean that?
- All right, may I tell you one thing?
- Yeah.
I was born in Hampshire, New York.
This is the way I call it.
Now, when I see the Negroes and the Puerto Ricans and the whites... pushing the wagons...
I made a canvas, just using blank face, mannequins... because they manipulate in a business form.
I know the scene - big fat belly with the cigar smoking, you know... sitting back and - ha-ha - playing his horses... and fucking a Puerto Rican or a colored girl in the back.
I've seen the scenes, baby.
- So you think-
- I gave up.
No, goddamn it, I give up.
Fuck it. With all the intelligence I got,
I fuckin' give up.
- You're giv -
- I'm not the only one.
- There are many here have given up.
- Why are you giving up?
Why?
I can't fight politicians.
I can't fight money
'cause I don't have money.
Rockefeller- How much money did he spend for his last goddamn campaign?
- I can fight that?
- Well -
Yes, years ago, centuries ago, maybe.
Not today you can't.
Even with words you can't fight.
Because they're gonna knock it off-
We have controlled press today.
Controlled press.
It's called controlled press.
I'm well aware of it.
Yeah.
What average man could buy
a Fortune magazine...
and learn what's happening?
Or what average man does?
- [Jonathan] What about love, man?
- Love?
Love is a feeling of the penis and the cunt.
That's what love is.
- Oh, boy. On that searching thought...
- All right? That's right.
We bid you good-bye.
- That's all there is, and there isn't any more.
- Okay. Bye-bye.
Okay, brother.
And that's what love is.
- Bye-bye.
- Love is a feeling of a desire, one for the other.
I never like to say good-bye.
I say so long.
- I think you lost something.
- Yes, I did. Thank you very much, my dear.
Très bien.
Merci beaucoup.
- So long.
- So long.
- [Woman Shouts] Victor!
- Yes, darling.
[Pat Muttering]
Keep on walking. Keep on walking.
My friend, I wish I could give those watercolors to you... instead of being wasted the way they were.
- [Don] Really?
- That's what I want.
[Greaves]
You were a machine gunner? Where?
- On the U.S. S. Alabama.
- I see.
- [Pat] That was very famous.
- [Man] Right.
- [Greaves] What other wars were you in?
- What other wars? Only one was enough for me.
I couldn't take any more.
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
- Good-bye.
- Bye - I never say good-bye.
- I like to say ciao.
- Then ciao.
[Pat]
Ciao.
[Airplane Passing Overhead]
Uh, yeah, what we're gonna do is, uh, we're gonna do a line reading first.
- And then we'll, uh -
- What is the line reading?
Well, we just - I just wanna hear you go back and forth... with the lines, make sure that we've got them under control.
And then after we've done that... we'll, um, we'll try to work out some kind of action... for you to, uh - to go through physically.
And, uh, then we'll see what the problems -
You'll play the scene.
Then we'll see what the problems are.
Then we'll get into it... increasingly more on a, uh - what, an emotional... and, you know, personal level.
You know, more the dramatics of the situation.
Okay. Um, Terry, I guess you can - you can start rolling -
- I'm gonna do a line reading with them.
- [Terry Speaks, Indistinct]
Um, who you gonna work with?
- [Chattering, Indistinct]
- Yeah.
No. You'll- You'll work, uh-
You'll work against
another recorder actually.
You don't need to do any recording of this
because I'm just gonna do a line reading of them.
- And there's no need to -
- Which recorder am I going to work again?
The recorder-
I mean, uh, John here has -
- All right.
- Hey, I'm picking up the cops.
- You're picking up the cops?
- Yeah.
- Let me see.
- On your microphone. Occasionally.
- [Siren Wailing]
- Oh, no. No, no, no.
That's his, uh -That's his -
Turn off your, uh -your intercom.
- Turn off what?
- Your walkie-talkie.
- Oh, it's his?
- It's his walkie-talkie.
- I'm on her and on him.
- Okay, l-let's -
Let's go down here.
This is roll one in camera "C."
Do me a favor and clap your hands.
[Greaves Muttering]
Excuse me.
[Terry]
Oh, no, just do it once. Just once.
Hold it. Fine. Thank you.
- [Chattering Continues]
- [Sustained Tone, Pitch Rising]
[Tone Pitch Continues Rising]
- [Tone Fades]
- [Staccato Beep]
- Did you see my cane?
- Yeah, it was right there.
It's gone.
- You didn't see it, did you?
- What?
My cane.
- Shit.
- It's gone.
- Is it here?
- It's not there. I left it right there.
When? Today?
- Oh, it's in back of this door.
- He's got it.
It's in back of this door here.
Will you remember?
Can you smoke here?
London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down
London Bridge is falling down
My fair lady
- You came here two years ago, didn't you?
- Yes, I did.
What's the reason for the change this time?
Why are you so big this time?
What do you think?
I have absolutely no idea.
I don't even know about it.
I figured just do the same thing I did before.
What's happening here?
What are we gonna do?
How long is it since you were last in London?
- About a year.
- About a year.
- What's your light bulb for?
- What's the light bulb for?
I thought you would ask me that.
No, I usually carry a light bulb.
Somebody gave it to me, you know?
Sorry, I didn't quite catch the answer.
Somebody gave it to me, a very affectionate friend.
I see.
Are you the folk?
- Who? Am I folk?
- Yeah.
No, no, no. Not me, I'm not folk.
What is your real message?
My real message?
Keep a good head and always carry a light bulb.
Well, I plugged it in my socket and the house exploded.
Do you think a lot of the young people who buy your records understand a single word of what you're singing?
- Sure.
- You reckon they do?
Sure.
Why do you say they do?
How can you be so sure?
They're quite complicated songs, aren't they?
Yeah, but they understand them.
How do you know they do?
Have they told you?
They told me, haven't you heard of that song?
"She said so..."
- What did it say?
- You got it wrong.
Do you think they don't understand you because they don't see you?
Would you say that you cared about people particularly?
Well, yeah, but we all have our own definitions of all those words.
"Care" and "people" and...
Surely, I mean, we know what people are.
Well...do we?
You sound angry in your songs, are you protesting against certain things that you're angry about?
I'm not angry.
- I'm delightful.
- I see.
- Thank you very much.
- OK.
Do you ever read the Bible?
What about the Bible?
Do you ever read the Bible?
- No.
- Have you ever read it?
Have I ever? I've glanced through it.
Because, you see, a lot of the things you say...
I've glanced through it, I haven't read it.
Put your hands up to your face.
Like that?
Well, as I was saying to him...
- I can't pose.
- You don't have to pose.
Just do it and I'll shoot.
- And again.
- Sorry?
- Be all solemn.
- I can't do it.
We publish these things, you know.
You're so cute, you know.
- Your name, please?
- Joan Baez.
Joan“.
B, A, E, Z.
Strewth!
- I didn't recognize you, I'm sorry.
- Good.
Nice to see you,
I've been looking for you all day.
This is the part where I don't write.
I'm not gonna...
Anything that happens now, I'll just remember.
Whereas, when I'm living, doing my own thing, doing what I do, this is never around me.
I mean, I accept everything, I accept this...
Why?
Because, it's here, it's real, it exists, just as much as the buses outside exist.
I mean, I can't turn myself off to it because if I try to fight it
I'm just gonna end up going insane faster than I eventually will go insane.
If I do go insane.
When and if the time comes... for me to go insane.
"Puffing heavily on his cigarette, he smokes 80 a day."
I'm glad I'm not me.
- D'you know that song, Sally?
- Yeah, I like it.
Donovan. Who is this Donovan?
Let's put him right on the sideboard.
- He's a good guy.
- I'd like to meet him.
- He's a young Scottish...
- Bloke.
I was gonna say that but I didn't know if you'd understand.
- Bloke.
- Bloke. Anyway, he's singing bit of folk music and he's a very good guitar player.
- He's better than you.
- Yeah.
- All right?
- Right away I hate him.
He's all right, I like him anyway.
He's not a fake. He's all right.
- Well, I got him up on the wall. Anybody I...
- Where?
He's right there.
"Is Donovan deserting his fans?"
He's only been around for three months.
That's what I call a loser.
No, I'm serious. No, listen...
- In the South, they get it.
- London, they get it. London...
It's ridiculous to say that.
They've done so much...
In a short time. That's America, we're talking about England.
When did Abraham say that we're all equal?
When was the Declaration?
- That was 200 years ago.
- Well, he said that, didn't he?
- He said that but he never does nothing.
- Nobody ever does without the vote.
...started working 26 years ago...
Where we going to, CBSO?
- He's not with us.
- He's not with us.
We're all thin, he's...
I've got an award for him for the most... promising artist of the year and the best-selling folk record, Freewheelin'.
- I just don't want them.
- Just have them mailed?
- I don't even wanna see them.
- OK. All right.
Tell them to give it to Donovan.
Groovy, man!
Donovan.
Donovan, next target.
He's our target for tomorrow.
This is for the African Service of the BBC,
Mr. Dylan.
West African listeners and it's going out this evening.
And the questions are four in number for your approval before we ask them.
The first one's a very general journalistic one.
Just how did it all begin for you?
What triggered it off?
How do you see the art of the folk song in contemporary society?
Has it a very real social impact?
Something that will certainly interest our listeners in Africa is your deeply humanitarian attitude to a number of public matters.
For instance, you are quoted as saying,
"People talk about negroes as if they were objects."
Does this sort of compassion on your part present any problems for you in America?
OK.
By the way, you took part in a play in Britain some time ago,
- by a school friend of mine, Evan Jones.
- Oh, yeah.
Evan and I went to school in Jamaica together.
Castle Street, wasn't it?
- Yeah, the Madhouse on Castle Street.
- Yes.
Going ahead in about five seconds from now, with this interview with Mr. Bob Dylan for the African Service of the BBC.
Pete Myers and Colin Wilde producing, in approximately five seconds.
How did it all begin for you, Bob?
What actually started you off?
Sentence.
"He is not so much singing as sermonizing."
Colon. "His tragedy, perhaps, is that the audience is preoccupied with song."
Paragraph. "So the bearded boys
"and the lank-haired girls,
"all eye shadow and undertaker make-up,
"applaud the songs and miss, perhaps, the sermons,
"they are there." Colon.
"They are with it."
Sentence.
"But how remote they really are from sit-ins and strikes and scabs
"and life." Paragraph.
"'The times, they are a-changing', sings Dylan.
"They are when a poet and not a pop singer fills a hall."
Be aware that tonight at the City Hall here, you had a greater audience than has been seen there for many years.
And more appreciation than has been heard there.
I've never heard so much applause here.
That makes me feel good, you know.
Makes me feel good.
Are you religious?
Well, what does that mean, "religious"?
Does it mean you bow down to an idol or go to church every Sunday or that kind of stuff?
- No.
- Believe in something.
- Do you believe in...
- I don't believe in anything, no. Why should I?
I don't see anything to believe in.
Do you think you're cynical?
No, I just can't see anything anybody's offered me to believe in that I'm gonna put all my trust and faith in.
Nothing is sacred.
- Who is in charge?
- In charge of what?
Who is in charge of this room?
What do you mean, in charge of this room?
It's rented to Bob Dylan.
- Are you Bob Dylan's manager?
- Yes, but I'm not in charge of his room.
- No, you're in charge of Bob Dylan.
- No, I'm not.
We have had complaints about the noise above, below...
That's unfortunate, we'll try to hold it down.
If it isn't organized within five minutes,
I will ask you to leave.
- Why don't you get a constable?
- I will.
Please do.
There's been no noise in this room.
You're one of the dumbest assholes
I've ever spoken to.
If we were someplace else
I'd punch you in your goddamn nose.
You stupid nut.
We've rented this room and I'm asking you to leave.
We have valuables in here and I don't want you in here.
Don't adopt that attitude.
Would you get out of this room?
You get out of this room also.
I don't care about your fop manager.
As soon as we're clear of the town...
There's one in there. Shall I read it out?
"American folk singer Bob Dylan sat scowling in a hotel armchair last night.
"In his hands was an iris.
"Bob, who arrived 90 minutes before his British tour was to open at Sheffield City Hall,
"said he wanted to rest.
"Asked to pose for a relaxing picture, he seized a flower and said, 'This is how I like to relax.
"'I've been through all this in the States.'
"The harsh, rasping, haranguing voice of self-styled guitar-strumming poet Dylan
"started with The Times They Are A-changin'.
They certainly are.
"This, swears my 17-year-old son,
"is what the kids who used to scream at the Beatles now go for,
"and if Dylan is a trend, not just a cult, parents need not be so condescending.
"His tour, opening at the 2,700-seat hall was a sellout
"but without one single scream and rapt attention to every word. It was very impressive.
"Dylan, alone with his guitar and mouth organ for an hour and a half, earned himself £2,000
"and a foot-stamping ovation."
That's all.
- Where you staying tonight?
- Hotel.
- Where?
- Near the theater.
In a hotel?
- You staying in a hotel?
- Don't be personal.
- Is that him?
- No.
- Isn't he handsome?
- Isn't he lovely?
Pinch me, pinch me.
Come down.
My dream's come true.
Are you gonna sing
Times They Are A-changin'?
You want me to sing that, huh?
- You really like that song?
- It's fantastic.
What do you like about it?
I don't like any of the
Subterranean Homesick Blues.
You're that kind of person,
I understand right now.
It's not you, it doesn't sound like you at all.
My friends were playing with me on that song.
I have to give some work to my friends.
You don't mind that, right?
You don't mind them playing the guitar and drums and all that kind of stuff with me?
It just doesn't sound like you, it sounds as if you're having a good old laugh.
Don't you like me to have a good old laugh once in a while?
Some people might take you seriously and think...
You know different, though, right?
Yeah.
As long as you know, you don't have to worry about anybody else.
People take care of themselves.
Got any brothers and sisters?
Have you any brothers and sisters?
God, I don't even know that.
I have lots of brothers and sisters.
Lots.
I've got a little sister, she's mad on you.
Is this called Merseyside?
Yeah.
What the hell's wrong with the mic?
You can't hear him.
What the hell's happened?
- No sound here at all.
- OK.
Nobody's pulled anything out, except that one.
For crying out loud.
Is he down there?
Is he down there?
This one was off as well.
Bob Dylan in the number 16 slot with his own composition, entitled,
The Times They Are A-changin'.
Caroline fans...
- What number was the other one?
- What?
- What number was the other one?
On the fab chart.
Straight across the front.
We do...
- about 20, 30 of your numbers.
- Really?
We give them all a big band sound.
You probably think we're ruining your material but we're doing it because we're idols of you.
Thank you.
Are you playing around anywhere?
When we play we try and tell them it's the words they ought to listen to.
You play with rhythm guitar and electric guitar?
Yeah.
We find it's very difficult to get people to listen to words, all they want to do is listen to...
I don't really... It's beyond me.
I don't... I just go out there and sing 'em, if the people are...
If I was booked to play,
I just go out there and sing.
I'm not gonna try and get anybody to listen.
Step over here.
Oh, bless his heart!
Let him have a bit of room. That's it.
Bye.
See you now.
See you later.
Oh, God.
- Watch out, watch out!
- That chick is on the back of the car.
- There's a guy on our car, will you get him off?
- Get that ch... Take her off.
- Hey, Bobby, tell the guy to stop.
- She's gonna get hurt.
It's a girl.
Take that girl off our car, please.
Will you please take her off the car?
You gotta get her off.
Will you get that girl off our car?
She's off.
OK, how you doing?
We'll see you later. Bye.
I don't remember that song.
I haven't touched that song. Did I?
- Do you remember any more?
- No, I never finished it.
Oh, God. You finished it about eight different ways.
Yeah.
- That's a good song.
- It's beautiful.
If you finish it, I'll sing it.
I can finish that.
Have you ever heard
She Died For Love At 3am?
Bill Anderson wrote it.
It's a great song. You remember that song in the Shadows Of The Warm Red Wine?
Oh, that's it. That was it.
- It's another verse. "I'm a rolling stone..."
- Yeah.
What about the...
Welcome home.
It's the first time this room hasn't been full of insane lunatics, man, that I can remember.
Bobby, it was almost so nice that you don't know.
Yeah, it's the first time it's been cool around here.
Oh, God. I'm sleepy. I mean I'm fagging out.
Let me tell you, sister, you were fagged out a long time ago.
Sure.
You fagged out before you even thought you were fagged out.
Oh, my God, there she is - Fang.
Do you have one of those see-through blouses?
She has one of those see-through blouses that you don't even wanna.
- Such pain, Baez!
- You wouldn't hurt his guitar, would you?
- Oh, pardon me.
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
Do you have somewhere maybe
I can write out these things?
- Do you have any paper?
- Oh, yeah. OK.
- You'll have to make the most of that.
- Really? Do we have any more?
Are you expectin' to get it all written on that paper'?
I've got all these songs written.
Have to write small or something.
Can I finish this?
Come on.
On with Queen Lucy.
Out of place, baby!
Crowned my daughter queen of the festival.
Did you see that man on the platform, reachin' in his pocket, pulled out a speech and said,
"So happy to be here."
Wanna do it now'?
Oh, concert.
I knew there was something.
I knew it wasn't the hotel.
Where is it?
What kind of money?
How far do you think we can push them?
I tell you, as far as Granada goes, they were talking 12, 1300 pounds.
- There's 1500 there, I know.
- You don't think we can do better?
Possibly, yeah, but I know that he's talking 12, 13.
Why don't we ask for 2,000?
Well, I had that figure in mind, strangely enough.
Get it settled.
Great.
- Why don't we get an answer?
- Right.
Tell them that I have to present it to Bob before we can give them an answer,
- but we'll give it to them by tomorrow.
- Fine.
I'll get Johnny and Granada. The other one was Rediffusion, but they're the same...
Johnny, please, urgently.
Wherever he is, track him down, dear.
He's in the studio, but his secretary said if you could hold, she might get him to the phone.
Just say "Bob Dylan", he'll be there in a shot.
Two grand, Johnny. Yeah, on an exclusive.
And it would be very much exclusive - he's not going to do anything else. Yeah.
You want to leave that with you, John?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Yes?
- This is Chris, Stuart's PA.
- Yes, Chris?
- He's not been available at the moment.
He's a bit tied-up down at the theater.
Can I help?
I think he may untie himself. Tell him this is the call he was expecting regarding Bob Dylan.
- Bob Dylan?
- Yes.
Well, you know, when I say he's tied-up,
I really mean it. I'm not kidding.
I know he is...with rope.
Right?
No, we've got another show on in the theater, you know.
Don't get upset, don't get upset,
I'm only kidding you.
OK. I'll try and get him.
Will you tell him, Chris, that I have
Mr. Grossman with me, Bob's manager?
He's with me now.
- OK.
- OK. Bye.
How about that? He thinks I'm putting him on.
What do you think, Stuart?
Oh, dear.
Now for the two...
Not bad for me.
I'd take it for a week's work, I don't mind.
Stuart, shall I just check this out now with Albert, to save you hanging on?
Then give you a call back? God bless you.
1,250. He probably could stretch to fifteen hundred.
So I'd think of this, you know. BBC.
Maybe for one show, but not for two.
I had a feeling that Granada would come up with the best money. They have in the past.
That's what they offered Peter, Paul and Mary for two shows on the BBC.
This seems to be their...their top.
I think we really...
If you get him back, why don't you let me take a crack at him on the phone?
Pleasure.
Because he called me in the States, you know.
- Who? Stuart or Johnny?
- Stuart.
Stuart? All right.
Stuart, I've got Mr. Grossman for you.
Will you hold on a second?
I spoke to you in New York, didn't I?
It's the number, yeah.
And at that time I indicated the kind of money that we're looking for for Bob, and I assumed that when Tito told me that you were interested, that we were somewhere in that vicinity.
And I was personally kind of surprised at the nature of the offer.
And much as we'd like to do a show for the
BBC, I think we can't consider it at that money because it doesn't come anywhere near the other offers that we have.
Well, the minimum that I would consider would be the fee that you mentioned for each half-hour.
No, no. I wouldn't. 1,250 for each half-hour.
Well...
Thank you very much. Bye.
He says he'll put it to them, but it almost certainly will be...
But I think he's got to come back with 2,000 for that. For two shows.
Then we're no better off.
We're still better off with the other one with one show. Aren't we?
I don't know.
Can we, without being in bad taste, can we get Johnny back on the phone and tell him it looks like we have a better offer from...
I'll tell him.
No?
Albert, if I may... Go along with me. Because
I know Johnny and Johnny's a good guy.
Johnny is not about to save them money, you know.
We only asked for two. He's not going to come back with more than that.
He hasn't said, "We'd like to give you a little more than you asked for."
What we can do is this. If we want to hold on,
Johnny will be back in the morning.
If he comes up with the two and if they turn around and say, "Forget it"...
If they come up with two, I'll say, "Johnny, because Albert wants to do it with you,
"we're not saying no to you and doing the other one, we'll tell you what happened.
"We were ready to do yours if you came up with two,
"but then the BBC got mad and came up with two,
"so you've got to top it."
Albert. Stuart, I'll be with Albert in a few moments and I'll put it to him, and, you know, I'm sure he'll come up with a decision very quickly.
Well, now, Stuart, let me tell you...
Yeah. No, let me tell you something, Stuart, between you and I.
Very truthfully, as you know, two months ago,
Granada came on when they heard he was coming.
And you know them, they pay, you know...
Well, they pay for the taxi as well, if you know what I mean.
And they've been on there hammering away like mad.
So Albert does have a pretty tough decision in a way.
Yeah, but have you seen today's chart?
Dylan, number six,
Subterranean Homesick Blues.
Yeah, it jumped from like 45 or something to six.
I'll be with Albert within ten minutes or so.
- Which one'?
- This one right there.
Do you believe that guitar?
They don't have those guitars in the States, man.
They're incredible. 20 grand?
Here he comes.
- I don't know.
- Had it cut down, dead long sideboards.
Do you think the bottom rule of it is you dislike me?
No, but there's some people that might.
Oh, no. You know, I've got my friends.
I mean, I'm, you know, I'm well situated.
What about before you had any friends?
Were you worried then?
I was not worried. I wasn't worried about it, no.
I was lucky. Weren't you?
What was it like when you didn't have any friends?
I can't remember not having any friends.
- Have you got a lot of friends now'?
- No.
Because I reached a stage where I suddenly realized what a friend was, and then I probably had one or two.
Before that,
I didn't understand what a friend was.
Now, do you talk to them?
- I didn't know who they were then.
- Do you talk to your friends?
There are one or two people who I believe I can talk to.
That's why your friends are your friends, because you can talk to them?
- I think a friend is a friend because...
- Communicate with them?
To a certain extent.
They understand me more than anybody else.
We come from two different worlds, you come from England, I come from the US.
That's true, but we're still human beings and there's some sort of connection between us.
No, I'm just a guitar player, that's all.
Man, you're trying to knock me.
No, believe me, I'm not trying to do that.
When somebody comes to interview you, what's your attitude?
You read those interviews that were done on the first few days I was here.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Those weren't right.
You know that, right?
You know that was all...lies.
Well, I don't know.
Lies and rubbish. You know that.
After the first few lines, I didn't read much of it.
Why I came in here, I don't know.
Being regaled with all this...
- Are you going to the concert?
- Yeah, I'm gonna watch.
- I mean, this is what I came to see...
- Well, listen. OK, listen.
I came to see you but I thought
I'd like to have a word with you first.
What is your attitude to life? When you meet somebody, what is your attitude to them?
- I don't like them.
- You don't like them?
I mean, I come in here, what's your attitude towards me?
I don't have attitude towards you at all.
Why should I? I don't even know you.
No, but it would be an attitude if you wanted to know me or didn't want to know me.
- Why should I want to know you?
- That's what I'm asking.
I don't know. Ask me another question.
Just give me a reason why
I should want to know you.
- I might be worth knowing.
- Why? Why?
Tell me why. What difference is it gonna make for me to know you?
Name me one thing I'll gain.
You might learn something from my attitude to life.
- What is your attitude to life?
- I can't explain that in two minutes.
All you're getting is two minutes. You're asking me to explain something in two minutes too.
You're the artist, you're supposed to be able to.
- I am?
- Yeah.
- What about you? Aren't you an artist?
- Oh, no.
- What are you?
- I'm a science student.
- Let's hear it again. A what student?
- A science student.
What does that mean?
Just what does that mean?
What do you do?
What's your purpose in the world?
- What's my purpose in the world?
- Yeah.
- What do you do in the world?
- I'm in the world for me, I guess.
- Like everybody else.
- Just like me.
- So we're just alike, aren't we?
- I guess so.
- We don't come from two different worlds.
- You were wrong. I was right.
All the time.
But this is interesting.
When I go to interview some groups, if I go to interview Alan and his mob, I don't think they could care less about me, you know.
Well, you know, haven't you ever stopped to wonder why?
There's got to be some reason, doesn't there?
But it's nothing to do with me because they don't want to know me before I go in.
- They don't know me...
- What are you after?
Can you write them up in your paper?
- No, I don't think of myself as necessarily...
- Get into the science.
- I'm a person, you know.
- Well, so what?
There's a million thousand billion of us, so many persons outside.
- I agree.
- You can't know them all, can you?
No. But if I meet somebody,
I speak to them for a few minutes, then I think, "That guy might be able to give me something."
Well, there's...
Now I'm getting down to it.
Yeah. What is it that you want?
Everyone is out for what they can get.
Well, I might be able to get something material.
Do you want to get a chick?
Do you want to pick up a chick?
I don't want it. I don't want it.
I don't want it. I can't play the thing.
- I don't want it either.
- Well, I can't play it.
They may give me something material, but I'm not necessarily interested.
- What do they give you spiritually?
- I might learn something.
- What do you want them to give you?
- Well, I won't know if I don't try to find out.
Why don't you try?
Don't you ever... Do you ever just be quiet?
- Be silent?
- Yeah.
And just watch and don't say one word.
Yeah, the whole thing that gets me about you and about Alan, is that you're knocking from the minute I come in.
- Knocking?
- Yeah.
I don't think you know when you're liked, that's all.
If we wanted to knock you, we could put you on.
Yeah, but I mean he's just said that I'm talking a load of rubbish.
I never said that, you're misquoting me already.
I didn't misquote you, I interpreted you.
You interpreted him to your own... to your own thing, right?
- Your own rules, of your own images.
- I had to give some answer.
Why? Why do you have to give some answer?
- Well, to satisfy you.
- You don't have to satisfy me.
Besides, it's impossible!
You should have said you didn't want an answer.
- Do you try to satisfy everybody?
- No.
Do you every once in a while, try?
- Once in a while try to satisfy somebody?
- Somebody, not everybody.
- A few people.
- But some people I can't satisfy.
No matter how hard I try,
I couldn't satisfy them.
How do you know that?
If you get to know somebody for a little while, you can guess just how...
Are you still friends with them, even though you can't satisfy them?
Yeah.
- Friends. Not deep friends.
- What do you talk about?
You find a field on which you can communicate.
What's a deep friend?
Somebody that you're on almost exactly the same plane with them, so you can communicate with them very well.
Somebody that's just like you.
- No.
- Looks like you?
- No.
- No?
- Talks like you? How do you like somebody?
- No. Thinks the same way.
Thinks the same way? Like what? Like people think... Both are happy about a green door?
- No, think in the same language.
- Think in the same language?
So you can understand each other.
And you know what each other think.
Let's try to understand each other, shall we?
That wouldn't be a bad idea.
It wouldn't be a bad idea.
How are we going to understand each other?
You can ask your first question. Go ahead, you've got a question to ask, come on.
- No.
- You haven't got a question?
- But I didn't...
- I think somebody's calling for you.
- You want me to go? OK, I'll go.
- You don't have to go.
I didn't come in here... He thinks of me as a journalist, but I'm not a journalist.
The high sheriff's lady would like to talk to you.
Who's the high sheriff's lady?
Would I know?
Do I look like Robin Hood?
Who the hell is the high sheriff?
- Who's the high sheriff?
- Her name is Sarah Lee.
- Where is this high sheriff?
- I think she's a big cheese.
She's next door. She's next door.
Is this Jim Clarke?
Jim Clarke is the high sheriff of Nottingham?
Oh, deary me.
- Better get your boots on.
- She wants to say hello.
- Who is she?
- The high sheriff... The guard just told me.
The high sheriff's lady. You might get knocked out by the high sheriff's lady.
I'm the sheriff's lady and on behalf of all of them,
I've come to say how happy we are to have you here, and I hope you have a very successful night.
Everybody loves you, there's thousands outside.
And these are my three boys.
David, Stephen and Stephen.
And they think you're so marvelous that they've left all their exam papers, they've left everything to come and listen to you.
- OK. I better be good.
- You better be good.
I don't think you can help being good.
But we're thrilled to have you here.
If you come after May, again, then I'll have you as my guest in the mansion house.
- This lady will be lord mayor.
- After May.
- This lady will be lord mayor.
- I think the songs you sing are very wonderful.
- And you write them yourself sometimes?
- I write them all.
Do you really?
They've got feeling and they're marvelous.
And I really mean this, I think you're a really good example for the youth.
- Thank you.
- So if you come back again,
I shall be delighted to have you both as my guests in the mansion house.
Here's my friend.
He's got something for you too.
How do you do?
- Here's a harmonica.
- Would you like it?
I'd love it. Is this from you? Thank you very much indeed. That's very lovely of you.
You're his friend. I've just invited your friend.
If he comes any time after May, he can come with you and stay in my mansion house.
It's a beautiful place. I shall be lord mayor after May, God willing, of this lovely city.
- Yeah, we'll come back.
- And I really mean it.
And I want everyone to know what a wonderful city this is and what hospitality we give, and I also want you to know how very thrilled we are to have you.
Thank you very much. Goodbye.
It's 7:30 now? Oh, shit.
- What song is that?
- George Formby.
He's the one that did
Mrs. Brown, You've Got A Lovely Daughter.
Oh, yeah, by Herman and the Hermits.
Have you seen that on television? Dave Berry.
He does all these slow actions like the human sloth.
He does...
He's great and he has a microphone and he drops it down his back.
What do the Animals do for a piano player now'?
Well, they've got one. There's a good friend of mine going to go in later on for good.
Aren't you playing with them no more?
I haven't seen them. It just happens, you know.
It's king-size.
Oh, man. I don't feel like singing.
You will when you get out there.
Two encores or one, man?
Maybe one. You know...
Maybe. I would like to do one.
Who did I give the matches to before? OK.
There it is. I want that.
- Have you got your rum in here?
- I'm not sure what's going on.
I'm thinking about a song that has to work.
- Did you get glass in that?
- Yeah, and wood.
What?
What are you doing?
Where are you? I'm talking to you over here.
- Keep it like that.
- Oh, are you over here now'?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Where's the door?
- Down the stairs.
- Where, man?
- Come on, get up the stairs.
Sorry.
- Straight through?
- Yes.
Up these steps.
Sorry.
Get in a taxi, Pete, come on!
Pete! Pete! Get in a taxi!
Where is he? Where is he?
Oh, he's going.
- Come on, down here!
- Come on, quick!
I wanna know who threw that glass!
- Yeah, this is...
- Who did it? Tell me!
If somebody don't tell me who did it, you're all gonna get the fuck outta here!
Now, who did it? I don't care who did it, man,
I just wanna know who did it!
I'm pissed, but I wouldn't do it.
I was out there in the bathroom going out.
Careful. Hey, don't tell me you're pissed, man!
Don't tell me you're pissed,
I don't wanna hear it.
- Who threw the glass?
- I didn't throw a glass.
Well, who did?
Tell me, you were there, who threw it?
You know who?
Yeah, I'm in a bit of bother.
All right. Hey, I don't care who did it.
If you know who did it, tell them to get out there and tell the cats that come up here to ask who did it, tell them who it was.
I'm not taking no fucking responsibility for cats I don't know, man.
I got enough responsibility with my friends and my own people.
- I know. I agree.
- Now, come on.
- I was out there...
- I don't care who it was...
I don't want none of your shit, man.
I don't want glass in the street.
- I'm not giving you shit.
- What did you do it for?
- What did you throw a glass for?
- I didn't.
Well, show me who did, if he's not here by the time I count to ten, you'd better take responsibility for it.
All right, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten - you got him here?
- I wouldn't do that.
- Hey, man, I'm not kidding you.
- I'm going!
- He's gonna clean up that glass, man!
- I'll clean it up! I'll clean up your glass, man!
- I'll help you, man.
- I wouldn't clean your...
- I believe he's all right, man.
- OK? I believe...
- Listen...
Don't "come on, listen" me,
I've heard it a thousand times, man!
- Listen. I'm going.
- I know a thousand cats that look just like you.
- Talk just like you
- Oh, fuck off!
- Well, well.
- You're a big noise, you know.
I know it, man, I know I'm a big noise.
- I'm a bigger noise than you, man.
- I'm a small noise. I'm a small cat.
That's right.
- If I'd have thrown a fucking glass...
- You're anything you say you are, man.
- I'm nothing!
- You're nothing? I believe you.
- Nothing!
- I believe you, man.
- Boys...
- Bobby Dylan...
- You're a big international noise!
- Could we have a drink over here?
I'm nothing. I didn't throw any fucking glass in the street, man!
You know, if I had, and I wanted to believe it, you know, and if you'd wanted to, you know, come at me for fucking glasses,
- you know...
- Just a minute.
- I'd have had a go at you.
- All right, man. Cool it, man.
- I will go down and pick it up for you.
- No, you don't have to, just tell me.
- Be groovy, right?
- Yeah, either be groovy, or leave, man.
You don't have to be groovy for me, just be groovy for anybody.
There's a gentleman here inquiring about a glass.
Right.
Hey, a lot of people can stay, man.
Whoever did that glass...
They damaged the car.
- Oh, man.
- Now we've got trouble, you see.
Oh, OK, we'll find out who did it.
We won't find out who did it today, I'm sorry.
I used to wear a cowboy hat like Jack, right?
I got a record of yours and Jack's.
- I have one called The Cowboys.
- You're joking!
- Also...
- Rambling Boys.
Rambling Boys and The Cowboys.
I just wanted to meet you sober, man.
Not to hurt anybody.
Just didn't want the glass to hurt anybody.
- Me too.
- OK.
Listen, man, why don't we get together, and I'll turn you on to some things?
OK.
Are there any poets like Allen Ginsberg around?
No. No, nothing like that.
- Dominic Behan.
- Yeah. You know what?
I don't wanna hear nobody like Dominic Behan, man.
- Dominic Behan is a friend of mine.
- That's fine, man.
I just don't wanna hear anybody like that though.
That's OK.
He plays like Jack, man.
Yeah, man.
Yeah, that's a good song, man!
Sing, Bob.
Well done!
- Play another one.
- I wanna do It's All Over Now Baby Blue.
- Go on, Bob.
- Yeah.
I've done that thing with the strings.
D tuning.
- Great, Bob!
- That was nice, Bob.
- I used to...
- You wanna hear another song?
Is that the stage door?
Please, yes.
I don't care what they see.
This is the Savoy Hotel here. We're on our way in about ten minutes with Mr. Bob Dylan.
So can you sort of expect us?
Through the stage door - there's not many kids there? OK, right, thanks very much. Bye.
Yes, very few there, apparently, so...
Beautiful day, man.
I've been in offices all day since ten this morning.
Organizing my other tour.
- The other folk singer, Donovan?
- Yeah, the other folk singer, yeah.
- How's that tour doing?
- Not so good.
He said, "What do you think if we booked a theater in Scarborough for a Sunday concert
"and put just Donovan all on his own?"
I said, "I can't see it for two hours."
He said, "Do you think we should book one other act?"
I said, "I think we should book about four."
This must be a very old theater.
- Sure. Victoria died in 1894.
- Queen Victoria built it for her dude.
Get up there, get a touch of reality.
Look at all the boxes!
God!
Hello?
- They're here?
- All over the place.
Yeah, I'll use it, man, you know? I'll use it.
Have you finished rehearsing now, have you finished rehearsing?
- Rehearsing? We're finished with the stage.
- Right, right.
Yeah, I'll use it, it's passable, it's just a drag that there's no new one.
Are you going to see the concert tonight?
Are you going to hear it?
OK, you hear and see it, and it's gonna happen fast.
And you're not gonna get it all. And you might even hear the wrong words. You know'?
I won't be able to talk to you afterwards,
I got nothing to say about these things I write,
I mean, I just write 'em.
I'm not gonna say anything about them,
I don't write them for any reason.
There's no great message.
If you wanna tell other people that, go ahead and tell 'em.
But I'm not gonna have to answer to it.
And they're just gonna think,
"What's Time magazine telling us?"
You couldn't care less about that either.
You don't know the people that read you.
Cos, you know, I've never been in
Time magazine, and yet this hall is filled twice.
You know? I've never been in Time magazine,
I don't need Time magazine.
And I don't think I'm a folk singer.
You'll probably call me a folk singer, but the other people know better.
Cos the people that buy my records, listen to me, don't necessarily read Time magazine.
You know the audience that subscribe to Time magazine?
The audience of people that want to know what's happening in the world, week by week, the people that work during the day and can read it.
It's small, right, and it's concise, and there's pictures in it.
I mean, those kind of people, it's a certain class of people, that take the magazine seriously.
Sure, I can read it, I read it on the airplanes, but I don't take it seriously, if I wanna find out anything
I'm not gonna read Time magazine,
I'm not gonna read Newsweek or any of these magazines, they just got too much to lose by printing the truth.
- You know that.
- What kind of truths are they leaving out?
On anything! Even on a worldwide basis.
They'd just go off the stands in a day if they printed really the truth.
- What is really the truth?
- Just a plain picture.
- Of what?
- Of, you know, a plain picture, of...
I should say, you know... a tramp vomiting, man, into the sewer.
You know, and next door to the picture, you know, Mr. Rockefeller, or, you know,
Mr. C.W. Jones, you know, on the subway going to work.
You know, any kind of picture, just make some sort of collage of pictures, which they don't do.
There's no ideas in Time magazine, there's just these facts.
You know, because even the article you're doing, the way it's gonna come out, it can't be a good article.
Because the guy that's writing the article sits at a desk in New York, without leaving his office.
He's just gonna get all these 15 reporters, and they're gonna send him a quota.
- You know?
- That's not true.
He's gonna put himself out, he's gonna put all his readers on it, and another week will have some space in the magazine.
But that's all! It means nothing to anybody else.
I'm not putting that down, because people have got to eat and live.
You know?
But, if you have to do this, be honest about it.
- I mean, sure...
- I don't think...
I know more about what you do, and you don't even have to ask me how or why or anything, just by looking, you know, than you'll ever know about me. Ever.
I mean, I could tell you I'm not a folk singer, and explain to you why, but you wouldn't really understand.
- All you could do, you could nod your head.
- You could be willing to try.
No, I couldn't even be willing to try, because it would be - there's certain things which - every word has its little letter and big letter.
Your friend had the right word - pigeonhole.
No, it's not pigeonhole, it's not the word at all.
Every word has its big letter and little letter, like the word "know".
- The word K-N-O-W?
- Yes.
OK. The word "know" - capital K-N-O-W.
- Yes.
- Like each of us really knows nothing.
Right, but we all think we know things.
And we really know nothing.
You're saying you know more about what I do...
No, I was saying,
I was saying that you're gonna die and you're gonna go off the earth, you're gonna be dead, and it could be 20 years, it could be tomorrow, any time, so am I.
We're just gonna be gone, the world's gonna go on without us.
Now, you do your job in the face of that, and how seriously you take yourself, you know, you decide for yourself.
OK? I'll decide for myself.
Now, you're not going to make me feel unhappy by anything you print about me, or anything like that, you know, you couldn't offend me.
I'm sure, you know, I couldn't offend you.
So...
All I can hope for you to do, is, you know, all your ideas in your own head, somehow, wherever they are...
Do you care about what you sing?
How could I answer that, if you got the nerve to ask me?
What a nerve asking me a question like that!
- I have to ask...
- Do you ask the Beatles that?
I ask because you have the nerve to question...
I'm not questioning you,
I don't expect any answers from you.
Do you think somebody wouldn't go see somebody if they didn't want entertainment?
- Of course not.
- Who wants to go get whipped?
And if you do wanna go get whipped, aren't you gonna be entertained?
Right? OK, so do you think anybody that comes to see me is coming for any other reason except entertainment, really?
They'll tell you they come for different reasons.
- Well, who cares what they tell you?
- They think they know why they're doing it.
- Do you know why they're doing it?
- I know...
People say all kinds of things.
The answer is to weed it out - can you weed it out?
I don't know how you weed it out.
Yeah, well, you see, you're not gonna learn,
I can't teach you to weed it out.
I didn't say that I couldn't weed it out,
I said I don't know yet.
Yeah, I have no idea.
First of all, I'm not even a pop singer.
- Do you think you'll ever be that?
- I don't know. I have no idea.
Every singer is in some sense a pop singer, even if it's Caruso.
- He's appealing to a popular...
- He's a pop singer.
Yeah, I'm just as good a singer as Caruso.
Have you heard me sing?
- Have you ever heard me sing?
- I like Caruso better.
Well, you see right there we have a little disagreement.
I happen to be just as good as him.
A good singer.
You have to listen closely, but I hit all those notes.
And I can hold my breath three times as long if I want to.
Is it gonna start on time?
Is it gonna start on time?
Miss anything different?
What time does it start? Seven o'clock?
- That's it.
- Donovan not playing?
- Yeah, keep seeing him.
- Don't start till he arrives, Bob.
- Yeah.
People who like Donovan, man, they just like everybody.
We got special speakers on each...
All the seats are sold, anyway.
- Are you gonna go on set or not?
- Yes, I am.
Hey, the Beatles are here.
This should be a lousy place,
I'll have to be able to hear myself.
- You hear yourself?
- There you go.
Stay right in back here.
About two minutes.
A minute and a half.
Next time I come in, then it'll be time to go.
So be ready.
OK now? Get the harps.
The hall is dark, come on.
Let's go.
I looked in the closet, there was Donovan.
This is called
It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding Ho Ho Ho).
Blinds out, house lights and the Queen.
OK? Fair enough.
Actually, the applause, it's kinda bullshit.
Better do something else, they're just sat there waiting.
See ya!
Go, driver, go!
Go, driver!
- Ah, beautiful, beautiful, man!
- That was a good concert.
That was a good concert.
Beautiful!
They were all there, man.
All of them.
Goddamn!
- The vanishing American.
- Yeah.
God, I feel like I've been through some kind of thing, man!
You have!
I know, but I mean, there's something special about it, man.
- They've started calling you an anarchist.
- Who?
- Papers, that's the word now.
- Anarchist!
- Yeah.
- You're kidding, what paper's this in?
Two or three.
Today, yeah.
Just cos you don't offer any solutions.
- You're kidding.
- Of course.
- An anarchist?
- Yeah.
Give me the cigarette.
Give the anarchist a cigarette.
Anarchist!
A singer such as I!
Yeah, I was surprised to see it myself, but there you go.
It took 'em a while to think of that name.
- No, they couldn't say communist.
- Didn't they say that yesterday?
Communists, in England communists really aren't, you know...
- Oh, it's cool.
- Yeah.
I don't think it's cool to be an anarchist though.
- No, I'm sure it is!
- I hope it's not, I don't think it is.
A wedding in Germany
Fallingbostel, May 1969
Dear children, even though your stomachs are full, you can stand a little speech.
Thirty years ago, when your mother and I married, the sky was blue, but dark clouds were already looming on the horizon:
The clouds of World War Two.
All of us gathered here today hope with all our hearts that you be spared such suffering.
Clermont-Ferrand: 134,000 residents in the Puy-de-Dôme region.
The capital of Auvergne is 240 miles from Paris and 37 miles from Vichy, which was the capital of France from 1940 to 1944.
Gergovie, a nearby Gallic town, used to be the fortified town of Vercingétorix, conquered by Julius Caesar.
A father tells his children about a more recent defeat.
In 1939, I was 27 years old.
I was the father of a large family, so I hadn't been sent to the front.
The front was the Maginot Line.
I'd been sent to Montferrand, near Clermont, and my wife's dairywoman, Mrs. Michel, had criticized me for not going to the front.
So after the rout,
I told her that there was no point in me going to the front, since the front came to me.
Was there anything other than courage in the Resistance?
Of course. But the two emotions
I experienced the most frequently were sorrow and pity.
The Colonel was a French Action man, the Major was a moderate.
The Captain was all for the diocese, the Lieutenant couldn't stand the church.
THE SORROW AND THE PITY
Chronicle of a French city under the Occupation
All these men made excellent Frenchmen.
Excellent soldiers who march in time.
Thinking that the Republic is still the best thing going.
Now most of these strapping lads don't share the same political views.
But they all agree, no matter what their view...
Part 1: THE COLLAPSE
Two brothers, both local farmers, live a few miles from Clermont.
They have many memories of German occupation.
Is that your village?
That's where I was born.
I was born near that church there, and later I lived on the farm facing the school.
You can't help but love your country.
Did you think about it in Buchenwald?
Not much.
– You didn't?
– No.
– What did you think about?
– Surviving. That's it.
That's mainly what I thought about.
But I'm talking about me, about how I saw things.
I'm not talking about those who...
There were some people who cried.
When I saw them cry,
I knew that they would never make it.
No way.
You had to think about yourself first.
And think about others after.
This politician also has reasons to remember.
For me, it was an experience that I will never forget.
This experience may have had a few secondary effects, but I don't believe it has affected my attitude or behavior.
Has it not made you feel bitter towards certain French people?
No, I wouldn't say that.
It showed me that there are certain tendencies and habits, which, when they are fired, fed, or stimulated, crop up like weeds, and so we must always be on the defense.
We have to protect our youth from this type of propaganda.
We have to talk to them about it more than we talked about it a generation or two ago.
The manager of the Philips company also has reasons to remember.
As I was saying, his friends would ask me why I joined the Resistance.
Why? Because going into a restaurant and seeing Germans at a table, and being told there's only four steaks left for the Germans and none for us was a little frustrating, seeing as that steak came from our cows in Auvergne.
So it was our right to eat it before giving it away.
That's my first reason.
My second reason was that the Germans were forever imposing curfews.
It was, after all, a Nazi regime, a totalitarian regime, no matter how you look at it.
It was worth fighting for, it was even worth dying for, rather than to live as slaves. Hence, the Resistance.
Lasting peace is what we need.
There's nothing dumber than fighting.
That's what I think.
– Depends on what you're fighting for.
– Do you think they really knew?
– They didn't know?
– I doubt it.
There are a few fanatics who know why.
– Did you know why?
– Yes, I did.
– But you weren't a fanatic?
– No, but...
But when I went off to war in 1940...
I left in 1939, on September 2, and I was sent to Modane.
What could I have done?
I knew nothing. I was going to kill guys I'd never seen before, who had never harmed me.
Later, they did harm us when they arrived in France. They messed us up.
Even in moments of calm, the soldiers are ready to fight.
Faced with the enemy, they have the winning qualities of patience, courage, vigilance, determination, and confidence.
In right-thinking circles, in high society in Paris, they sympathized with our soldiers, whose troubles were unfortunately nothing compared to what came later.
And consequently, during this period, people sought to distract them, to entertain them, to relieve them from the boredom of the Maginot Line, where time passed at a snail's pace.
It must've been painfully boring.
So the right-thinking women of the Parisian bourgeoisie decided to form a committee to entertain our valiant soldiers, to provide them with a more pleasant view.
The idea was to plant rosebushes on the Maginot Line, to make it look prettier, to create a nicer atmosphere.
And there were people who donated money towards these rosebushes, so that our soldiers didn't have to look at the horrid, concrete walls, and to give them a flowery environment in which to live.
It's pathetic when you think about the awful things that came later.
The infantry is advancing at great intervals.
In Oisemont, the enemy has set fire to the tanks of an oil factory.
It took two weeks in Poland.
We felt it would be just as quick in France, as we were anxious to go home.
And, indeed, we took France in just one month.
And onwards it goes. Next stop: Paris.
Naturally, we attacked on several occasions, but the hardest time was in Oing, on the Belgian border.
The Belgian blockhaus weren't ready, but we had to take position in them.
The Germans arrived equipped with tanks.
All that we had were machine guns.
They proceeded to kill everyone inside, because it made such an easy target.
There were no battlements.
They hadn't even put up reinforced doors.
I'm telling you, we walked...
We withdrew, and we must have walked at least 20 miles, without running across any troops.
Not one single troop.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
First of all, I'd like to emphasize the fact that the German staff was not expecting to achieve such a quick, resounding success.
We soldiers, unlike Hitler, were convinced that we were facing the same adversary as in 1914-1918, a determined, brave adversary, prepared to fight to the bitter end.
Unfortunately, I must admit that Hitler was right in this case.
He was always saying how the French were incapable of repeating their performance in World War I, and he never missed an opportunity to add to this statement a few disagreeable and derisory remarks or comments on the general emotional and moral state of France.
GERMAN NEWS
Near Noyon, General Stummel, taking the vanguard with his troops, with his adjutant, took several prisoners.
It began with two.
Later, many others surrendered.
The prisoners come from every nation and every walk of life.
So-called defenders of the great nation.
In fact, a shame for the white race.
These are the Black brothers of the French.
In the words of Chamberlain,
“We, together with our allies, are the guardians of civilization.”
“Together we fight medieval barbarism.”
These are the guardians of civilization.
These are the barbarians.
This is the war of the Franco-English plutocrats.
They began this war rashly without taking any heed of the consequences, to fight for the English lords, not only until the last Frenchman, but until the last French house.
Mrs. Tausend, you stayed in Germany.
Did you read the papers?
Did you watch the German news?
Yes, we followed the events closely.
Naturally, we were a bit frightened.
But the news of victory made us happy.
These cars are stopped for a lack of gas.
The Jewish warmongers and Parisian plutocrats, with their suitcases full of gold and precious stones, have fled.
This shortage of gas put a crimp in their plans.
The streets were hopelessly blocked.
Yet these English-loving traitors and deserters continued their journey on foot.
These are the French people who have been mercilessly evacuated and dragged along in the flood of the routed French army.
Soon, these people will be able to go home.
The German people were spared such a trial, thanks to the Führer and his German soldiers.
During that time, there was an enormous upsurge of the people, who were completely panicked, terrified.
Fate willed that I should be given leave in the last few days of the month April.
Consequently, I was in Paris in early May when the Germans invaded.
On the roads, people were going mad, terrified by the bombings.
With them, they brought what they could:
Children, pets, precious objects...
Some rode on wagons, others on bicycles.
It was a mish-mash of everything and everyone. It was awful to see.
It was all the more awful in that the Germans, in an effort to block and ruin the roads for the soldiers didn't hesitate in bombing these columns of refugees.
As a result, and I can attest to this fact, that there were bodies strewn all over the place: Men, women, horses.
Car wrecks sprinkled the roads.
It was a scene from hell.
And yet this wave, this flood of people, continued to move south.
Our impressions?
We saw destroyed villages, burned lands...
It did have a certain effect on us.
– And the people on the roads?
– They were fleeing the bad guys.
What do you mean?
Weren't you the bad guys?
At first, we were seen as the enemy who was set to destroy the country.
Then they began to see that we just wanted to help.
And that reassured them.
The officers or the staff were clearly out of their depth.
Having the trains, the roads, and all telecommunications cut off led to a situation in which any plans the soldiers had made were suddenly completely ruined.
In addition, certain military circles shared the attitude of many civilians, and tackled the war unenthusiastically.
After all, they were living in...
I'm not saying they were traitors.
In any case, there were very few traitors.
But this attitude of preferring Hitler to Léon Blum was an attitude that had become very popular in bourgeois circles.
And this was a circle to which many of the soldiers belonged.
THE GREAT BATTLE OF FRANCE
On June 14, 1940, the Germans occupied Paris.
In Clermont, the papers went mad.
Le Moniteur took a stand, asking the people to stand up and fight, to resist, to remain free.
The owner of this anti-defeatist paper,
Pierre Laval, a deputy for Auvergne, was, at the same time, preparing for surrender.
The last government of the Third Republic slowly moved southwards.
Paul Reynaud wanted to keep fighting, but Philippe Pétain was already taking charge.
In Briare,
Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden met with their allies for the last time.
I've always felt that Reynaud wanted to continue, that he remained calm and firm.
Everyone was in a very difficult position then.
I also believe, and this is something he told both Churchill and me, that he wasn't very happy having Pétain as a part of his government.
– He'd foreseen the difficulties?
– Yes, already in Briare.
Now, I was a young soldier in World War I, and for me, Pétain was the hero of Verdun.
But his character had changed.
That's to be expected with age.
I'm sure he was opposed to the idea of your cities being destroyed, because he spoke of it at dinner, saying, “It's awful seeing our lovely cities destroyed.”
And I had to answer, “Yes, I understand.
“It's hard for an Englishman to say this, but there are worse things
“than the destruction of cities.”
But I don't think he was convinced.
We flew over France at a very low altitude.
– Hedgehopping?
– Yes.
In June, there's nothing quite like the Norman and Breton countryside.
And I remember, as if it only happened yesterday,
I remember thinking it was lovely, but would I ever see it again?
And it seemed rather unlikely that I would.
Then the political climate changed and became unbearable in Bordeaux.
Suddenly, treason was everywhere.
There was a will to surrender, and a desire to get along with the victors at any price.
Anglophobia, ever-present in France, resurfaced with new vigor.
And all this went hand in hand with a horrible kind of cynicism.
The military leaders, the ones who had messed up, weren't even mentioned.
Instead, people blamed absolutely everything on Léon Blum, the Front Populaire and so forth.
And so we consoled ourselves for the downfall of our nation by getting petty revenge in matters of internal affairs, a trend which, as you know, continued long afterwards.
On June 16, the government met in Bordeaux.
Paul Reynaud was defeated by the deputies who refused to leave France and Pétain became the head of government.
Adolf Hitler's elite S.S. Troops have invaded Vichy.
I felt terribly humiliated, as I had been sent on a mission on an English motorcycle and was heading to Paris, when I saw the Germans going the other way.
Now, being rather absent-minded,
I saw there were some people following these German troops, and assumed it was the English.
So they were going one way, and I was going the other.
I saw the swastikas on their helmets, and I thought I should go no further.
But no one asked me to stop.
Everyone was too busy going their own way.
If I didn't like it, tough.
The Resistance in Clermont was quickly crushed.
But the struggle, albeit subdued, continued.
Hitler's S.S. Division conquered Clermont-Ferrand.
German troops occupied the city for three days.
Zepp Dietrich, division commander, declared victory on Jaude Square, as his troops polished their boots in front of the locals, before heading off to new victories.
The Germans didn't return to Clermont until November 1942.
Our aim now is to take the arms depot in Etienne.
An entire infantry regiment has simply surrendered.
At first, I did the same as everyone.
I hadn't understood.
On the morning of June 24, the lieutenant declared that
Marshal Pétain had requested an armistice.
I knew what he meant by armistice, but I wasn't sure about “Marshal.”
I was never particularly in favor of Pétain's regime.
Nonetheless, like the other 40,000,000 Frenchmen who experienced that same moment, when I saw the rout, when I saw that the Germans were in Biarritz, and that France had been completely invaded,
I thought, like everyone else,
“Will anyone be able to end this massacre?”
People of France, as requested by the President of the Republic,
I shall henceforth be the leader of the French government.
Convinced of the affection of our admirable army,
whose heroism stands as testimony to our long military tradition
as they fight an enemy which outnumbers them,
convinced that our army's resistance
has fulfilled our duty towards our allies,
convinced of the support pledged by the former soldiers I led,
convinced of the French people's faith in me,
I give France the gift of myself,
to ease its troubles.
In these difficult times,
I think of the poor refugees,
who, in the depths of despair, trudge across our roads.
I extend my compassion and concern for them.
My heart is heavy as I tell you today that the fight must end.
Last night, I spoke with our adversary
and asked if they were prepared to help me, between soldiers,
after the fight, with honor intact,
to find a way to end the hostilities.
From the Führer headquarters a historical piece of news:
The prime minister of the new French government, Pétain has declared, in a broadcast to the French people, that France should lay down its arms.
Of course, I was happy to hear we'd won.
The defeat gave me the same feeling
I would get when I played rugby.
I don't like losing, especially when it's 60 to 0.
I hate drawn-out defeats.
This stone is a reminder of the humiliation of Germany on November 11, 1918.
Is it true that France had given England its word of honor that it wouldn't agree to a separate truce?
I think we... That was before
I was a member of government.
I think we had reached an agreement whereby neither party would cease fighting.
– Without the other party's consent.
– Right.
But we didn't discuss that at all when Churchill and I were there, because we accepted the position France had taken.
– In Briare, he said...
– That he'd accept an armistice?
No, he said we accepted the fact that you may not be able to go on.
Nothing was said about an armistice.
It's clear that between a ceasefire and an armistice, there's a big difference.
Exactly.
He simply said, “We understand that you cannot go on any longer.”
That was clear.
The question was quite simply,
“What are you going to do?”
I even sent Churchill a short letter after we returned from Briare, which has since been published, saying that we must make a clear distinction.
If the French can no longer fight, that's one thing.
But if they make it easy for the enemy, that's another.
La Madeleine. Early today in Paris, the Führer made an unexpected visit.
During his tour of Paris, he also visited this building.
Place de la Concorde.
The Arc de Triomphe.
Trocadéro.
A look at the Eiffel Tower.
On the Führer's left, Professor Speer.
One thing we should remember is that when France agreed to an armistice, even though we didn't want to lose, how many Frenchmen said,
“All's well that ends well.
So much the better.”
As for Marshal Pétain, he knew what he was doing in Vichy.
In every canton and every town, he formed what was called the French Legion.
– The Legion of Companions.
– It was meant for us veterans who'd fought in World War I.
Everyone, except me, went on Sundays.
I'm the only one who never set foot in there.
It's true.
They would attend the raising of the colors on the market place every Sunday, wearing their hammer and sickle. No, not hammer.
I don't mean the hammer and sickle.
What was it called again?
– The sword.
– Whatever.
They'd all been given a beret.
Can you imagine?
Of course, I never set foot there.
Not on your life.
But when I saw what happened,
I understood.
So suddenly, this old marshal suggests an armistice with French honor intact and so forth.
As a young Frenchman, do you feel the defeat was justified?
Does it not disgust you?
No, defeat was the inevitable consequence of French politics.
In fact, this was the theme propagated by the Vichy government.
If we were defeated, they claimed, it was because for so many years, we had to put up with party politics, which is the reason
France is in this situation today.
How did that phrase go?
“The parties which have harmed us so much...”
It was... No, that's not it.
– Something about lies.
– The lies that harmed us.
Right. “I hate the lies that have harmed us so much.”
At the same time, there was another appeal launched by de Gaulle, an appeal which apparently very few people in France heard.
I certainly didn't hear it.
But as a pilot, weren't you slightly tempted to...
I imagine that a certain number of people in the same unit as you chose to “continue the struggle,” as they said.
There weren't many who did.
Let's get it straight.
It's true that some people attempted to flee to North Africa.
Later, the situation stabilized.
Not so many fled.
Did it ever cross your mind to flee?
Of course.
But I didn't think about it for long.
My father quickly made me understand that Marshal Pétain guaranteed a new order, renewed honor, etc.
The victor of Verdun guaranteed
France's honor and the establishment of a new order.
This seemed not only desirable, but necessary, to many Frenchmen.
They respected and had faith in the Marshal.
In Clermont, the spirit of renewal filled
Pierre Laval's Le Moniteur.
Editorials sought those responsible for defeat and found them.
“Let's be French.
“Too much foreign influence has led to many problems.”
On June 26, 1940, in the magistrate's court,
René Mons was sentenced to three months in jail for defeatism.
Editorial.
We demand that those responsible be tried and an analysis of our problems ensue.
This quickly led to xenophobia,
Anglophobia and anti-Semitism.
Gaining French nationality became harder.
Vichy came out with the decree:
“The French elite must be restored.”
On that day, July 29, 1940,
Clermont butcher Antoine Labronne was tried and given a large fine for having sold rotting ham.
Did you ever speak about what the papers said back then?
– Never.
– Never?
We were totally cut off from the world, because there was one value that we all shared, and that was caution.
We didn't know what the butcher thought, or the milkman, or the engineer or the intellectual.
We had no idea.
Like everyone else, we stayed on our guard.
What do you think people's main concern was back then?
Food.
That took up most of your time?
Definitely.
Animals were illicitly butchered.
One needed a bit of meat to survive.
As you know, the French are very good at cheating.
One had to have a bit more bread than the usual ration, or a bit more tobacco by smiling nicely at the tobacconist.
A bit more of everything.
So every weekend, a regular parade of cyclists would go for supplies.
They had devised a system based on tickets, on ration cards.
Personally, I was a smoker, and it was awful not having cigarettes.
It was a horrible situation.
People would do anything, even steal.
I got so desperate that I even rolled artichoke leaves and smoked them.
The children who were born during that time, between 1942 and 1944, should have suffered from rickets, and I say this as a doctor.
In our family, it was ironic.
These young ladies have a brother, who is 27 years old, and was born in 1942.
He's six foot one!
We fed him so much to avoid rickets that he turned into a giant.
He's a great tennis player, an architect, and a giant to boot.
Are you what they call “a bourgeois” in a large provincial town?
If being bourgeois means eating properly, hunting in Sologne, having a hunting ground in Sanscoin and in Sérye, and a son-in-law who owns Lake Montciniére, then I'm a bourgeois.
When did you first begin to experience the consequences of the times, in other words, persecution?
How did you feel about that?
Did anything happen?
Not before 1942.
The only extraordinary event that occurred is that before the children were born, once again, in September 1942, the hunting season was re-opened.
What an event.
It was important to the hunters.
Game had been untouched for two years so there was an abundance of it.
It was a very satisfying experience for those who owned a gun.
In their little nests in the backyard, my little rabbits are so sweet.
Until recently, I hated hutches, and I despised and insulted our gentle little friends, now the center of our attention.
Just think, a rabbit!
Firstly, it will delight the cook.
And as its skin dries in the wind, the whole family rejoices.
Follow my example and give rabbit breeding a try.
As you can see, I love, you love, we all love rabbits in every form!
In reality, the French aren't normally very involved in politics.
Once in a blue moon, they decide to take action and storm the Bastille, or to fight religious wars for 50 years, or to initiate the French Revolution, or to set off to conquer Europe.
But, normally speaking, they're just as peaceable as anyone else.
One thing is for sure:
The French, in general, like a peaceful regime, a regime which has authority, but is preferably humane.
In any case, they feel the need to be protected.
They're quite paternalistic.
Does this explains Pétain's popularity?
Definitely. I might add that, as a sergeant in the French army,
I've seen a routed army.
And it's not a pretty sight.
There's no denying that, for some time,
Pétain was extremely popular.
He was viewed as one of the good old guys, perhaps a bit senile, but after all, he had given himself to France.
That was a clever way of putting it.
He gave the gift of himself.
So everyone thought that an old guy like him couldn't do any harm.
He could only help France.
At his age, what harm could he do?
These arguments, albeit feeble, were how people justified Pétain.
THE MARSHAL'S VISIT
I missed Mers-el-Kébir.
I only heard about what happened two weeks later.
I never understood Mers-el-Kébir.
Even now, having read many books on the subject of Mers-el-Kébir,
I still don't understand.
It was always a mystery to me.
Mers-el-Kébir was a mystery indeed.
Do you mean you don't understand why the English did what they did?
No, I never really understood the English.
After leaving Churchill,
I was a member in the House of Commons,
I went to the House of Commons, got my car, and drove myself through Hyde Park.
In the middle of the park,
I saw a group of French sailors, with their little red pompons on their kepis.
They were running and playing with an equal number of girls, or “young ladies” rather.
They were running and playing and screaming.
They couldn't understand a word of what the other was saying.
Then a horrible feeling swept over me.
It was sheer luck that I didn't crash the car, because suddenly I remembered
Churchill's ultimatum I'd just read, and I thought of those French boats in Mers-el-Kébir, where there were other sailors, also wearing kepis with little red pompons, and I wondered what was going to happen to them tomorrow.
These are the victims of the most base and loathsome attack ever.
Clearly, France's former ally only attacks those who cannot fight back.
On the morning of the attack,
Admiral Gensoul received the English ultimatum.
Admiral Somerville proceeded to send several delegations, in order to explain to Gensoul the options proposed by Churchill:
They could join the Free French, allow themselves to be disarmed, or head to a neutral port which was out of German reach.
Admiral Gensoul refused all three options, as he considered them dishonorable solutions.
What we didn't dare to risk happening was letting the boats fall into enemy hands.
We simply couldn't take the risk.
But wasn't there also a psychological risk?
Yes, a considerable risk.
It allowed the Germans to spread propaganda.
And Vichy, too.
Lord knows they used the opportunity.
I think we understood that, but at the time, we had very little choice in the matter.
There were 1,600 sailors killed by the British Navy.
The British Navy attempted to take over the French Navy.
That was clear to us at the time.
We thought that...
We believed the armistice would be respected by the Germans.
In France, we thought, as the Vichy government had told us, that the French Navy would never be given over to the Germans.
For us, that was a fact.
I was brought up to believe that promises were kept, and I just couldn't imagine that there could be political dealings that would eventually lead to the French Navy being given away.
There was no way.
So we viewed it as a brutal attack.
There was also an additional moral problem, in that, according to many testimonies, the sailors whose boats were shelled by the British believed at that moment they were going to cast off in order to join the British fleet.
That's terrible.
Had we felt there was any hope of that, we would never have attacked.
But there was no hope.
Everything we said about the Germans was proved in Bizerta, where the Germans proceeded to give the French admiral twenty minutes to surrender, to surrender boats and all, on pain of an immediate bombing attack, or of being taken prisoner.
Our predictions all came true.
We knew who we were dealing with.
It was then, shortly after these events, that the French, whose faith in the English had been greatly shaken, made contact with us for the first time, through General Huntziger at the Armistice Commission in Wiesbaden, to discuss the possibility of changing the armistice clauses to allow military collaboration.
And it was the discussion of such options, for which each side undoubtedly had its own personal motivations, that initiated the negotiations, which are now known as “collaboration.”
While the talks were beginning,
Hitler and Pétain agreed to meet in Montoire.
In our first meeting,
Laval told me he was a Germanophile.
And as he had known me for years, he asked me to put in a good word for him with Hitler. And I did.
I think Hitler felt Laval was sincere, at least in one aspect:
When he spoke of collaboration.
And that was the main issue at the second meeting.
In such cases, the defeated want to know what will become of them.
What will the peace treaty be like?
Whereas the victors I've often seen generally don't know what's next and cannot answer such questions.
That's how it went in Montoire.
Hitler didn't know how to answer Pétain's questions about boundaries or the fate of prisoners.
So it ended with everything up in the air.
Ah, Montoire... Now that was quite a story.
Where was this Montoire, anyhow?
Everyone was looking it up in the atlas to see where it was.
When we heard what had transpired, it was depressing.
Some even cried the next day.
– People were crying?
– Yes.
Soon afterwards, a new slogan became popular,
“Collaboration is:”
“Give me your watch,
I'll give you the time.”
That was the slogan.
That was collaboration.
He often said, also in my presence, that he hadn't yet decided whether England or France should pay for the war.
On the basis of his “race ideology,” or whatever you can call this point of view, many felt much more related to the English than to the French.
I am convinced that France, as Hitler saw it, could only play a minor role in a National Socialist Europe.
He had never been in France or anywhere else in Europe.
Whatever knowledge he had was derived from books, which had first been adapted to his point of view.
In his mind, he felt that a decline of the French people was unavoidable. And this idea was confirmed by the French defeat.
During his travels, Hitler sometimes shared his thoughts with others.
April 5, 1942. Suppertime.
The Führer says that if one plans on ignoring the terms of a contract, no use quibbling over details.
Hence, we must assure ourselves that the French are sincere.
No point in trying to pickpocket an experienced pickpocketer like the Führer himself.
In any case,
France's main task for the next 50 years is to repair the damage done at Versailles.
April 24, 1942. Suppertime.
The Führer says he is against marriages between the Wehrmacht and foreigners in occupied lands.
Such demands are generally based on sexual frustration, which is common in troops abroad.
He is struck by the contrast between the photos of the German men, and those of the women, who are very shabby looking.
The Führer feels that such marriages are doomed from the start, both in terms of individual happiness and racial purity.
He is more in favor of harmless passing fancies, which are inevitable in this type of situation.
The conditions created by
National Socialism within German structures at that time made it impossible for us to respect the clauses of the armistice.
We couldn't help what happened, any more than we could have helped all the other horrible things which continue to haunt any rational human being.
We couldn't stop Hitler and company from invading Alsace and Lorraine, making them a part of the Third Reich, and eventually incorporating their youth into the Wehrmacht.
This was all out of our hands.
We can reproach ourselves until kingdom come, but there was nothing we could do.
You say that after Russia, you were sent to Alsace, and then France.
Why? Was Alsace not France?
No. For us, it wasn't French territory.
The people were pro-German.
I even brought my whole family.
There were some people with bad intentions, some patriots who were ready to do anything.
But there weren't many.
So I felt like
I was in a country of German origin.
And now?
I've never gone back.
No, but what do you think of it now?
I think it's true.
I think it belongs to Germany.
Here a show is being put on for the S.S.
Bruno Fritz's amusing ice hockey report.
The German player is taken by surprise and falls down on... on the ice!
He stands up again. It feels too cold.
Thanks to Franco-German economic collaboration,
100,000 French workers now work in Germany.
Four trains leave the capital weekly and head for German industrial regions.
Today, at North Station, the war councilor Michel has come to shake the hand of worker number 110,000: Edouard Lefébvre.
Tell us, Mr. Lefébvre, were you unemployed?
– That's right.
– For how long?
It's been two years now.
– Are you married?
– With children.
This vast organization has already had good results:
Lower unemployment rates, and understanding between workers.
I'd worked for the Finance Minister and the State Secretary since 1923.
In 1940, Mr. Lansfried requested that I go to Paris, as head of the military-controlled finance division in occupied France.
He didn't want a National Socialist party member in this position.
Were you not a member of the party?
Yes, shortly before, I had joined the party, again at the request of Mr. Lansfried.
We tried to be as reasonable as possible, and as fair as possible, not only in our own interests, but in those of France as well.
This famous democracy, in the past 20 years, has proved itself incapable of eliminating such poverty.
The Third Reich, however, aims to provide its workers everywhere in Germany with healthy and beautiful hometowns.
This is a new settlement in a small industrial town, which naturally has a daycare center, a clinic, a center for mothers and children and an X-ray lab.
One gets the impression from such reports that German propaganda was quite open in its racial prejudice, and often implied that German discipline and structure were necessary qualities to clean up what was considered to be “the French mess.”
Yes, there is some truth in what you say.
In our offices in Paris, we also had a propaganda department.
But it received orders directly from Berlin.
And I would like to point out that, from the outset of my job...
It was the first ministerial-level visit from the French government, the Minister of Transport visited in September 1940.
He was accompanied by the owner of a racing stable, who wanted permission to begin horse racing again, as it was a very popular national pastime.
The races are ever-popular.
One thing is clear,
Paris has become Paris once again.
I listened to my collaborators and said, “Why not?”
And so the races started up again, and continued until 1944.
Thanks to us, the theaters were able to open their doors again.
We often went to the theater, alone or with friends.
The Germans also attended the races, which is how the different parties made contact quite spontaneously.
Personal relationships developed between the different sides, probably for various reasons.
I'm sure you're aware there has been a tendency in France since the war to deny that such contact ever existed.
Yes, but it did exist.
Germany was triumphant, and there wasn't a single front from which it failed to come home victorious.
There's no denying that the German army made quite an impression on the youth in France.
Seeing that army of young men, stripped to the waist...
After all, I'm the son of a soldier and I was a soldier myself.
A sense of responsibility, hierarchy and discipline mean a lot.
A well-disciplined army was important to people like us.
This was the first time we had seen such an ideal army.
The French army was nothing compared to this army who could put the fear of God into an entire people.
It sounds awful to say, but it's the truth of the matter.
We solemnly swear to unite and to place our forces, our faith, our ardor, at the service of the Marshal, at the service of France.
This campfire draws a three-day meeting to an end, during which the discipline and dedication of these young men were proved once again.
The French believe servicemen should be tough as nails, and at the end of the day, they always turn to servicemen, whether it be to restore order, to prevent a coup-d'état, or to organize a coup-d'état.
But the serviceman is omnipresent, with his cap, his pompon, his saber, no matter what his rank may be.
The French love their army.
Poem by Officer C. Languillon, published on the front page of
Le Moniteur on November 24, 1940.
“His name rings as a gunshot.
“Pétain ready for the challenge?
The soul is willing.
“But goodness is ever aloof.
“The great victor, even greater in defeat.
“Schemers, foreigners, buffoons and fools,
“have brought you to your knees, O France.
“The hero of Verdun, cleaning the slate,
“Is setting our house in order from top to bottom.
“A Herculean labor, a difficult recovery.
“From the ruins come muffled groans.
“Former profiteers writhe in the rubble.”
Pétain, in a series of speeches, drew conclusions from this defeat.
And he did so with skill.
He could woo his audience.
If one was to read the texts now,
I haven't read them in years, but I bet if you read them now, you would be quite surprised.
Yes, the texts relied heavily on the people's collective unconscious.
Absolutely right.
– He blamed the parliament.
– Yes, the parliamentary system...
Certain employers were suspect... foreign... cosmopolitan, not to mention dark-skinned.
And of course, he blamed the Communist Party.
The Communist Party was the cause of all evils.
All hotels were requisitioned, and the Park Hotel was occupied by Marshal Pétain and his staff.
This is where I met up with my friend,
Colonel Gorosse-Tardou, who lived with Pétain.
He was the chief of staff for his aviation department.
Consequently,
I was often at the Park Hotel.
It was always busy, with lots of people milling around.
Everyone kept their voices down and spied on their neighbors.
Personally, I wasn't used to their system, but when I spoke,
I followed everyone's example.
They were forever shushing one another.
– Everyone was very suspicious.
– Of the enemy or of one another?
A bit of both.
Are you a Republican?
Not really.
– Not really?
– No.
You're more of a Monarchist?
Yes, that's right.
French news. Late 1940.
Pilot-sergeant Gonthier de Basse, veteran of WWI, volunteer in '39, hurt in Dunkirk, has, of his own free will, agreed to make the following declaration.
Ever since my return from England aboard The Sphinx on October 5,
I've been surprised by the number of my compatriots who still believe the wounded in Narvik and Dunkirk were all well-treated by our ex-ally and this is why I've decided to share my memories with you.
When we arrived in England, we harbored no grudge against our English comrades.
But after the tragedy in June, when we were invited to come serve under a new flag, when they offered to pay us our dues in pounds sterling, we could only reply with disdain and indignation.
We French soldiers can only serve under our own colors.
Anything else would be treason.
Fellow Frenchmen, comrades, our duty is to stand side by side behind our leader, Marshal Pétain, to guarantee France a place of honor in a new Europe, and to allow the prisoners to return home immediately.
It is a difficult task.
Those who try to divide us are enemies.
United we stand, divided we fall.
The idea was to get out of the war, come what may, as quickly as possible.
There were 15,000 French sailors in Liverpool.
I went and spoke to them.
I tried to persuade them to continue the war.
But there was no way.
We were so low on people that we needed them to dig the trenches, and we offered them wages to do so.
They said no.
They said, “France is no longer in the war.
“We no longer have the right to dig trenches.”
You see... the kind of attitude they had.
Their desire to get out was almost spiteful.
As for what would become of England, they didn't give a care.
That's the kind of attitude they had.
They felt that it was inconceivable that the English succeed where the French army had been beaten.
On June 17, 1940, the steam liner Le Massilia headed from Bordeaux to Morocco.
Several parliamentarians were aboard.
This event caused much ink to flow.
I boarded Le Massilia without suspecting that it was a big trap.
Those who stayed behind in Bordeaux quickly understood that they could exploit the circumstances, and influence the public to think that the departure of the boat and the fact that a number of politicians were aboard, was a sign we were panicking, running away, abandoning them.
In other words, deserting.
The people aboard Le Massilia who actually wanted to fight were quickly judged to be cowards who were fleeing the fight.
It was paradoxical that some of us, including Viénot, Jean Zay, Wiltzer and I, were tried for desertion, when in fact their original plan had been to go fight.
And as far as I was concerned,
I was almost obliged to go, seeing as my unit had gone, and it was my duty to follow them.
Everyone wound up in Rabat.
There were tons of people.
Once there, I went to lunch at “Balima,” Rabat's best restaurant, where everyone met.
One of my cousins,
Du Jonchay, a pilot, was there, and naturally we discussed what had happened.
He showed me Pierre Mendès-France, who was sitting at a table with a lovely woman, who was his wife.
My cousin turned to me and said,
“Our State Secretary there is responsible for our defeat.”
There he sat, our little lieutenant, drinking champagne.
That champagne completely infuriated me.
I walked up to him, and told him this was no attitude to have, after being defeated, drinking champagne in public as if he was delighted about what had happened.
Then what?
I told him if I saw him again, I would kick him out.
And I gave him my card.
– It caused quite a stir.
– You were picking a fight.
No, I simply gave him my card to let him know who I was.
Not to hide my identity.
How did he react?
He got up, stood to attention, and said nothing.
I was a captain, he was a lieutenant.
I see.
There was surrender and treason.
But anti-Semitism had also begun to rear its ugly head.
Many who used to hide their feelings openly declared their anti-Semitism to the point that France began adopting certain German values, and sought to get closer to Hitler, in the hope of creating a Europe where
France and Germany would collaborate and obviously anti-Semitism became a common element between many Germans and Frenchmen.
And, of course, Jean Zay and I had the misfortune of being Jewish.
Actually, I was Jewish.
Jean Zay was only partly Jewish.
He had converted, as had his father, but he was of Jewish origin.
This didn't detract from the atrocious campaign against him, which, as you know, ended in his being killed.
Jean Zay was arrested.
His pregnant wife was in Casablanca.
She had a very tough time to find a hospital bed, or even someone willing to help her give birth.
There was such hatred.
When clinics or hospitals heard that she was Jean Zay's wife, they didn't have the courage to admit her.
You can't imagine how rampant sectarianism had become.
In any case, Mrs. Zay's pregnancy was certainly a very trying time.
She lived with my wife and they spent many long hours together during which they were abused and insulted.
My wife also had a very rough time of it.
Anyhow,
Madeleine Zay eventually gave birth to this baby, whom I had the opportunity to meet, as I was arrested shortly after the baby's birth.
And when I was transferred to Clermont-Ferrand, where I met up with Jean Zay,
I'd seen his daughter and he hadn't.
JEAN ZAY
To Appear In Court Tomorrow
The committing magistrate was
Colonel Leprêtre.
I don't want to name names, but this man's reputation lives on today.
The man was very intelligent, very bright, clever and cunning, but he had a very perverse side to him, in that he harbored great hate for the accused, especially if the accused was left-wing.
He got a certain morbid pleasure from seeing an important man accused.
Even outside of cross-examination, he would sometimes visit the prison, just to sit and chat with the prisoners.
He would go in their cells, and sit on their beds, pretending to speak with them simply.
He clearly got a great deal of pleasure out of holding the fates of such formerly important men in his hands.
There was something very sick, very odd about it.
A strange man.
So he would confess to certain things in moments of relaxation?
One day, he said to me,
“I know what you think of me.”
The man was bright enough to understand.
Very intelligent.
He said to me,
“I know what you think of me,
“but in an organized society, there are certain tasks,
“tasks which must be done, and which require people to do them.”
“Every society needs garbage men.”
He chose that word.
Were you able to emphasize the racial and political background and motives to the trial?
No, our main concern was to obtain satisfying results, and we knew that these judges wouldn't appreciate such arguments.
Even if we had said that his being Jewish should have nothing to do with the trial, we knew perfectly well that it would be a major issue.
The hearing was extremely tense.
It began at 9.00 a.m. With an introduction by Pierre Mendès-France, which the Colonel received with obvious contempt.
He had been given a table and a jug of water.
He began with the following introductory statement:
“Colonel and gentlemen,
I am Jewish, I am a Freemason,
“but I am not a deserter.
May the trial begin.”
The court was presided over by a rather frenzied man, called Colonel Perret, a colonel in charge of tanks, who harbored a particular hatred for General de Gaulle, because they had served in Saint Cyr together and were both competitive.
He hated anything to do with de Gaulle,
Gaullism or Gaullists.
Furthermore, he was a very frenzied character, who ran the hearings in an atrocious manner.
My sentence was nothing compared to the death sentences he gave out.
He was responsible for executions, which is considerably worse than the sentence he gave me.
I must say that those present at the hearing were extremely hostile.
The audience had been rigged, no two ways about it.
Women whose faces were filled with hate.
I won't name any names, but they were hateful people, people who were hoping for the cruelest of sentences, who were hoping I'd be killed immediately, who didn't think I should even be allowed to defend myself.
Some 300 or 400 entry cards had been delivered, but only six were for the defense.
The cards were quite a story.
As only a limited number existed, and they were in high demand, a new black market developed.
There were bistros in Clermont that hawked the cards.
Flatteringly enough, they were very expensive, twenty francs for the show.
It cost more than the movies.
There's no denying that public opinion was strongly influenced by the papers at that time, which felt that the politicians who were accused should automatically be declared guilty.
My colonel, my lieutenant-colonel and my general all took the stand and said, “He didn't desert.”
When the commissioner, whose name I won't give either, stood up and announced in a choked voice that he was sentenced to six years for desertion,
Mendès told him,
“Sir, I'm sure you'll be rewarded.
“You've served the master well.”
Former State Secretary
Sentenced to six Years in Jail for Desertion
I don't know if Rochat told you that a man came to see him the next day.
And this man told him,
“I'm a Pétain supporter,
“and I am appalled by what happened yesterday. It's scandalous.
“The Marshal must not be aware that such things are happening.
“The Marshal must be informed of such goings-on.
“I saw you stenograph the hearing.”
Which indeed he had.
“Could you get a copy for me to bring to the Marshal himself?”
Rochat gave him a copy which he took to the Marshal.
Naturally, nothing ever came of it.
And the man who took the copy was a certain Mr. Giscard d'Estaing.
It is these children, the pupils of French schools, in whom the Marshal sees hope for our country.
He has come to speak simply, as only he can, in a modest school in the town of Périgny.
You may sit down now.
You don't have to stand to listen.
Young pupils of our French schools, the reason I wanted to speak to you today on this day as you begin a new school year, is that it's important for you to know that I am counting on you to help me rebuild our country, France.
So work hard, stand firm, and do your best.
All rise.
I had to pass through Vichy to reach my posting in Billancourt in the first two weeks of August 1940.
Many people told me that Marshal Pétain was very tired, and was only lucid for two hours a day.
Imagine my surprise when I met this man, who, although elderly, stood bolt upright, with his look of steel, which many people have commented on, and with the greatest of ease, politely asked me to sit down and make myself comfortable, then said, “Mr. Lamirand, there's been much talk about you here.”
The secretary general of youth,
Mr. Georges Lamirand recently visited Lavalette camp, the main goal of which is to train the men of tomorrow.
He visited these young men who are united by a common ideal, and live life in continual contact with nature, work and simplicity, these values upon which we must rebuild our country.
We talked and I thought to myself,
“What bad luck.
“They say he's only lucid two hours a day, and I chance upon those two hours.”
The problems of youth are fascinating, but I had absolutely no idea that, in the position
Marshal Pétain wanted to grant me, there were so many fascinating subjects and problems to solve.
Repeat after me: Long live France!
Long live the Marshal!
Louis Renault finally agreed to give me leave, saying to Pétain,
“I'll lend him to you for a month.”
And Marshal Pétain, in his infinite cleverness,
“Fine, one month.
“But if you don't mind, let's make the job renewable.”
And he renewed it 30 months.
Mr. Lamirand is inaugurating an exhibition of drawings sent to Pétain by French schoolchildren.
The little ones wanted to answer the Marshal's call, they wanted to show the Marshal their towns, villages and homes, hence sharing a piece of their daily lives with him.
A school girl, perhaps the youngest in France, had the luck of being allowed to give Pétain her lovingly written letter in person.
It was about adding a new element to the famous triptych of the time:
Work, Family, Nation.
Honor your work, your family, and your nation.
A national revolution?
You said it.
Marshal Pétain has already told you several times what he meant by social revolution.
He feels that our social system is unfair.
There is too much poverty, too much injustice.
And that is what he wants to change.
He is bound and determined to bring happiness to France, and asks us all to join in a communal effort.
Dear friends, this is his social revolution.
That was when he started planning his escape.
He grew his beard, shaved it off, grew it out again, and one fine day, he left.
I must admit I'm not very athletic, but I prepared myself by working out for several months beforehand.
I was high up, so I had to jump off a high wall.
But I had to run the risk.
And once I had jumped,
I would be a free man again.
Just as I was about to jump...
There were trees planted along the avenue.
I heard the unexpected sound of voices.
I tried to see in the semi-darkness.
There was a couple sitting under a tree.
You can imagine what they were discussing.
He knew what he wanted, but she hadn't decided yet.
It seemed to last an eternity to me.
She ended up saying yes, but I had the impression she had put up a great deal of resistance.
Finally, they left. And so I jumped.
And let me assure you that I was even happier than he was.
I'd really like to meet him someday and let him know how much I experienced with the two of them that night.
How you admired his audacity.
Yes, and how her lack of audacity struck me as being so untimely.
Anyway, love, fate and escape eventually won the day.
Did you disguise yourself?
I was disguised, but not very well.
You see, many people back then who wanted to disguise themselves would let their beards grow.
So, bearded men automatically arose suspicion!
I let my moustache grow,
I gave myself a new hairstyle, parted straight down the middle.
I got a pair of glasses.
And of course,
I changed the way I dressed and so forth.
The next day,
I went for my daily visit with him, to see if he had escaped or not.
I arrived and saw all these people with decameters in hand, taking all sorts of measurements.
They were hysterical.
They asked me what I wanted.
I said I was there to see my client.
They asked if I knew
Pierre Mendès-France had left. I said no.
I burst out laughing, which made them angry.
They carried out a huge security check of all the roads and trains.
But my plan was to not contact anyone, to not count on anyone, to be cut off from everything and everyone.
I must say that life in France at that time is very difficult to imagine, and even more so to describe.
You had an old pair of shoes you hoped would last.
If they got a hole, there was no leather to fix them.
There were no plates, there were no matches, there was nothing.
It is very difficult, in hindsight, to describe what it was like living in a country where everyone was always searching for everything.
The new rage in Paris is silk stockings without the silk.
All you have to do, ladies, is dye your legs.
It's easy and practical. A great idea.
The ladies are trading in their garters for paintbrushes.
Worried about what will happen when you bathe?
No problem.
Paint-on stockings are waterproof.
On top of that,
Elizabeth Arden guarantees they won't run!
That's a Parisian habit which will disappear.
Where is France headed?
Where is Europe headed?
Some 3,000 people in Chaillot will hear
Mr. Alphonse de Chateaubriant discuss The French Drama.
At this very moment, a huge continental unit is slowly taking shape.
It will be one gigantic geographical piece in the puzzle, with one single political and economical doctrine, stretching to the very tip of Europe, the very tip of which is France.
Therein the importance of France becomes clear, as France becomes, in this new division, the outer edge, the last bastion on the Atlantic of this immense continent, faced with another large continent,
America, which is ready to take over the ancient order of things, the ancient riches and capitalist creeds, the ancient gold and the ancient man, in order to make it their last refuge, their last fortress, and their last army.
I sincerely hope that everything I have said tonight will give the word “collaboration” new meaning in your eyes.
It's not surprising that, at first, such poison won over many new converts.
Little by little, people began to realize it was propaganda, and to see that the government was practicing a policy, which they themselves called collaboration with the enemy.
Slowly but surely, people began to open their eyes, and change their minds.
But this propaganda still won over many new converts.
You know as well as I do that anti-Semitism and Anglophobia are never hard to stir up in France.
Even if reactions to such things are dormant or stifled, all it takes is one event, one incident, one international crisis or one Dreyfus affair, for feelings we thought long gone to suddenly re-emerge in full force, for beliefs we thought dead to be simply dormant.
Edouard Drumont was the first in France to examine the Jewish question.
The Institute of Jewish Questions celebrates his memory today.
Mr. Laville has agreed to say a few words.
Out of 100 Frenchmen of old stock, at least 90 are pure white, free of any other racial mixture.
This isn't true of the Jews.
The Jews are born of a mixture which dates back thousands of years, between Aryans, Mongols and Negroes.
Therefore, Jews have unique faces, bodies, attitudes and gestures.
It is reassuring to see that the public is interested in studying the characteristics presented in the morphological section of “Jews and France.”
In October '40, when I came home on leave,
I heard that a good friend of mine, a teacher, wasn't allowed to keep teaching that fall, because his mother was Jewish, making him half-Jewish.
I'd met Jews before, but I treated them the same as Catholics, Protestants, or people with no religion in particular.
It wasn't a revolution yet, but it did give me food for thought.
– Did you have any Jewish teachers?
– Let me see...
We did have one.
Yes, he was fired.
The same old story.
No one ever told us anything.
Listen, I think we should make a little nuance here.
I think that when you take cases like this teacher we mentioned,
I think that we tried, to the best of our ability, to get these people some work tutoring and so forth.
We did that for another colleague, too.
Like you say, it wasn't much, but we did have sympathy for them.
Did you really try?
Did every single teacher in Clermont give in their resignation?
No way. You've no idea what the mentality was like back then.
A collective resignation? Come on!
In 1940, Vichy came out with the Jewish decrees.
In the small ads of Le Moniteur, a local merchant announced that he was 100% pure French.
Sir, are you Marius?
Yes, I'm Marius.
You're weighed down with medals.
I fought in World War I.
– They're all medals from WW I?
– That's right.
You must be a very brave man.
I followed the others. I did my duty.
When France was demobilized, when France was defeated in the 2nd war, how did you react?
We certainly weren't very happy.
As veterans of World War I, the defeat affected us deeply.
Were there many Jewish stores?
Yes, there were.
So you must have seen a lot?
You could say that.
They all packed up their bags and left.
They went into exile.
And there weren't any arrests?
There were arrests everywhere.
And you saw them?
Yes, unfortunately.
Tell me, when what were called
“the Jewish decrees” came out, apparently you took out an ad.
That's correct.
It was an ad in Le Moniteur.
You're certainly well-informed.
You see, sir, we were four brothers.
It was the solution I found, as people thought we were Jews.
My name, Klein, sounds quite Jewish.
But I'm a Catholic.
And this was a real source of concern.
I had some problems because of that.
Four of my brothers fought in the war.
It was important that I tell people that I am really French.
In other words, you wanted your clients to know you weren't Jewish.
That is correct.
Why?
Because some said I was Jewish.
Jews were being arrested, and they said we were Jewish.
Do you see?
I couldn't very well allow myself to be labeled as a Jew since I'm a Catholic.
So that's why, as you said,
I took out an ad.
Four of my brothers fought in the war.
One was killed.
– The other three were imprisoned.
– But Jews fought in World War I, too.
That's true. I realize that.
I've never been a racist.
Jewish or Mahometan, all that mattered to me was that the man did his duty, in which case, he was as French as the rest of us.
You understand?
You weren't high on the priority list of those persecuted by Hitler's regime.
But did you know any Jews,
Communists, or Freemasons who were?
I met more Jews than I'll ever meet again.
I had two girls working at the pharmacy, who were considered to be evil just because they were Jewish.
One was the daughter of an amazing man, a Parisian polytechnician.
She was a pretty amazing girl herself.
The other was the daughter of Hirsch, a colleague in Strasbourg.
Nobody wanted anything to do with these girls.
He had warned every pharmacy in Clermont not to hire these girls.
– Who is “he?”
– The pharmacy inspector.
The movie industry gave them a chance to steal billions of francs.
Tannenzaft, better known as Nathan, who in the eyes of the world, was the ultimate symbol of French cinema, has cost the public nearly 700,000,000 francs.
Mr. Pierre Mendès-France, did you enjoy going to the movies back then?
I went to the movies because I enjoyed it, but I had yet another reason, as I had quickly discovered that movie houses provided a refuge which was both fun and comfortable, you could sit down in a movie theater at 3:00 in the afternoon, and stay there in the darkness for hours on end, without anyone ever seeing you.
It was a great hiding place.
In many pre-war French movies, there were Jewish actors or Jewish directors.
And in the credits of these movies, the Jewish names had been erased.
Today World News was able to film a part of the trial of the Jew Tannenzaft, Bernard Nathan.
Our presence clearly disturbed the accused who wanted his privacy.
He raises an objection, but is overruled by the court.
Go away. Leave me alone.
This is a tragedy, not a comedy!
The Germans were discreet about it, but they wanted to see their movies.
There were operettas.
There were the first movies in color.
Some, like La Ville Dorée, weren't propaganda, others were.
Films like Le Juif Suss were pure propaganda.
And the thing that I found most revolting was that they weren't only German productions, which would have been understandable since they had occupied us, but that they were made with the blessing of the French authorities, on behalf of French organizations, dubbed by French actors.
The events in this film are based on historical fact.
At first, movie-goers probably thought these movies were just like any other German movie.
But people very quickly began to realize that it was just typical propaganda, in the worst sense of the word.
This led to a kind of strike among viewers.
Even those who weren't especially interested in the Free French, who had gotten into the habit of seeing normal German movies, were extremely revolted and refused to have any part in it.
Gentlemen, this Jew's criminal record shows nothing of the suffering of our people during his tyranny.
This is why I give the floor to the person who has suffered most.
I ask for nothing.
You are the judges, not me.
Please, Sturm, you are the one with the most right to judge him.
It is not my decision to take.
Suffering is too subjective.
It would be unfair.
However, I see an ancient article of criminal law which applies:
“If ever a Jew commits a sin...
“If ever a Jew commits a sin of the flesh with a Christian woman,
“he shall be publicly hung without further ado.”
“If ever a Jew commits a sin of the flesh with a Christian,
“he shall be publicly hung without further ado,
“as punishment, and as an example for all others.”
Have mercy! I've done nothing wrong!
I've always acted in the name of my savior!
It's not my fault that your duke wanted to betray you!
I can fix everything, I swear. Everything!
Take all that I own. Take all my money.
But don't take my life!
I am innocent!
I'm just a poor Jew. Let me live.
I want to live!
I want to live! Live!
The State Council and I speak for all Wurtemburgers in decreeing that all Jews must leave Wurtemberg in the next three days.
This is valid across the entire country.
This decree has been taken in Stuttgart on February 4, 1738.
May our descendants remember this, for in doing so, they will spare themselves much pain and suffering, and will keep their blood pure of the influence of this accursed race.
THE END
There were only certain people who actually enjoyed Le Juif Suss, the anti-Semites who saw their beliefs confirmed in the movie.
The collaborators would also see it.
Then there were those who were taken by surprise.
I'd say that 80% of the people who came to see Le Juif Suss assumed it would be just like any other light-hearted movie.
The German films weren't particularly good.
However, they featured many French film stars, as Continental had made many French films before the war.
Tino Rossi and the like filmed at Continental.
As an artistic endeavor, several actors are off to Germany.
At East Station, we've spotted Albert Préjean.
Danielle Darrieux.
Suzy Delair.
Junie Astor.
Viviane Romance.
Dr. Karl Fröhlich, president of the German Cinema Corporation, has invited them on a 12-day studio tour of Vienna, Munich and Berlin.
Today Mr. Heydrich, general of the S.S. And head of security, was sent to Paris by Mr. Himmler, chief of the S.S. And the police, to officially install Mr. Oberg in his new post in occupied territory.
Mr. Heydrich is president of the International Criminal Police, a commission to which
France has always belonged.
Mr. Heydrich visited Mr. Bousquet, secretary general of the police, and Mr. Hiller, secretary general of administration.
He also had a chance to see Mr. Dartier de Pellepoix, in charge of Jewish Questions, as well as Mr. De Brinon.
What was Paris like back then?
There were two sides to Paris.
There were those struggling to survive, and there was high-society.
All we were missing was Régine.
There's no doubt about it.
Everyone's ashamed to say it today, but for some, life in Paris was great.
Maxim's and Le Boeuf sur le Toit did a booming business.
The movie industry was in full swing.
From what I've heard, actually, or so they say,
French films were so good then because a certain category of producers had fled to the States.
Many directors have gone on to do very well in their careers, but they forget what they said then.
Paris was a fun and crazy place.
Let me assure you that there were some wild and crazy times back then.
All right, boys. This way.
We'll go straight to the source to whet our whistles.
What happened to you in 1937?
You can't even begin to imagine.
– It's a long story.
– Be careful...
First give us a drink, then we'll see what's up.
I think we're going to earn our drink today.
– Is that red wine?
– Yes, it's as Red as I am.
So what happened in here?
This cellar has seen everything.
The Resistance in Auvergne began here.
The night the first weapons arrived, we met in this very cellar.
And we sang the Internationale.
We weren't Communists, but as Pétain sang the Marseillaise, we had to sing the Internationale.
You see, people attended the raising of the colors reluctantly.
– Yet they still came?
– They had no choice.
It is in times like those when you begin to realize what people are really like.
– How do you mean?
– They were scared stiff.
With only a few exceptions.
– Was it really a risk not to come?
– Risk or no risk, they still came.
– So they thought there was a risk?
– They thought so.
I was under the impression that there were quite a few students here who ardently supported General de Gaulle.
For example, there was the son of a colleague whose name escapes me, among others.
What about among the teachers?
I really can't say how many teachers supported him.
We were sympathetic to the young people's cause, but there wasn't the same enthusiasm... the same enthusiasm which was gaining momentum among the young people.
Why do you think that is?
It often seems to be the case in life.
Young people are, in general, more sincere and more dynamic.
They don't think things through.
I think it would be fair to say that they are less cautious.
They are more open and friendly.
What do you think?
– They're not as scared.
– True.
Some of my students got caught.
I can't really say who.
Not so many, just a few of them.
In fact, many of them now have streets named after them here.
There was Bacaud.
The street going to Fontviége is named after him.
– I taught this charming boy.
– He was in the Resistance?
These people, as Dionnet was saying earlier, had created a network.
We only found out about it later.
They continued to pretend they were just your average students.
But we only found out about this later.
Perhaps Dionnet, who was in the Resistance, knew.
What was it like for the others?
How did the others react when someone's desk was empty?
I don't know. I can't remember.
When a student's parents were arrested, and the son showed up at school the next day, how did they react?
– I can't remember.
– How can you forget?
Can you remember?
No, I can't.
No specific examples.
I see some examples on the wall.
Those are our former students...
Aren't those the students who died in World War I?
It says World War II.
I'm trying to remember, but I can't.
Clermont-Ferrand is giving
Marshal Pétain a warm welcome.
He has come to approve the constitution of the Peasants' Union, and the end of the winter crusade for National Aid.
The head of state will then receive the donations to National Aid brought by peasants from all over the region.
It is a symbolic ceremony for the French mutual aid campaign.
A great day for France as our hearts beat together in collective hope.
NIKKATSU PRESENTS
Missing Person's Report,
Compiled on May 31, 1965.
The report is submitted as
No. 64 of 1965 at the Honjo
Branch, Tokyo Metropolitan Police.
Name: Tadashi Oshima, born Jan 2, 1935, age 32.
Male. Nationality:
Japanese.
Date of abscondence:
April 20, 1965.
Occupation:
Plastics salesman.
Permanent Domicile:
Naoetsu, Niigata Prefecture.
Bodily Characteristics:
160 cm tall.
Medium-height and build.
Square face with broad eyebrows.
Short, curly hair.
No glasses.
Snaggletoothed.
Oshima went to Fukushima on business on April 12, 1965.
He was scheduled to return
April 18 to the dormitory.
All his personal belongings were left in the dorm.
He has since disappeared.
Reason for disappearance, unknown.
In this small island, Japan, there are crowds of people.
I have no idea of where on earth he is.
He may be hiding in a hole somewhere.
It is a total mystery to us.
Do you have any idea why he disappeared, Mr. Oka?
I have no idea at all.
He had been embezzling money from the company.
When was that?
Two years before he disappeared.
- So, four years ago?
- Yes.
How much?
Altogether, about 400,000 yen.
Did he return it?
Yes, we deducted it from his salary.
Did he have an expense account?
He sent most of what he was supposed to send.
So I estimate he took
60 or 70,000.
I've known him only a short time.
So I didn't have time to really get to know him.
He lived with you for 15 years.
You know him well.
What kind of person is he?
We worked together since we were in Tokyo.
He's not the suave type, not at all.
He is rather weak and mild.
But his character does change when he's drunk.
You were like a mother to him, why didn't he tell you?
It is a pity he didn't.
He lived with us since my 16 years old son was born.
Since we went through his adolescent days,
I thought I knew everything about him. I was wrong.
You were his marriage go-between.
Why do you think he disappeared?
He withdrew money without telling Yoshie, his fianceé.
He left her with less than
30,000 yen in the bank.
He was afraid that Yoshie would condemn him.
He is a weak man. He disappeared to avoid confrontation.
How did you arrange their first meeting?
When I was in the hospital, my daughter and Yoshie's sister visited me.
While we were talking about Yoshie, we came to the conclusion, that she was well-suited for Oshima.
Yoshie was working at your Kawasaki branch factory.
- Yes.
- I see.
Until when did you and your brother, Tadashi, work together?
Until 1955.
I see.
When did you quit?
In October, 1955.
About his disappearance,
I think your brother felt guilty over the embezzlement.
Did he say anything about it to you?
No, he didn't.
But he couldn't get rid of his sense of guilt, could he?
He returned the money he sent, but the guilt made him reckless, I think.
How do you feel about your sister being in our movie?
I know it is difficult for
Yoshie, but...
I hope that she can forget about Tadashi... by talking about him in your movie.
By speaking her mind in the movie?
It's been a year and half since he left.
I know it must be hard for you to talk about it...
But will you tell us?
You quit the hospital, right?
The reason why I quit was because...
I got tired of being asked about him.
- So when you came...
- You were annoyed?
Yes, very.
I tried to forget about him.
I tried to give him up, and went to the police to find him.
I did my best, but I just couldn't find him.
I was getting far too stressed out.
If I knew the reason why he disappeared...
I may be able to forget him.
- If you are sure of the reason?
- Yes.
Do you still love him?
Yes, I do.
I can't forget about him.
That means I still love him, I think.
A MAN VANISHES
Ancestors of the Oshima Family, let us know where he is.
Please, please let us know.

HAYAKAWA Yoshie
I said to him, I know you have troubles, but
I told him to return to his family.
He said he couldn't.
He wouldn't listen to me.
An ancestor of yours died in extreme agony.
She still cannot enter into the celestial world.
Do you know her?
Can't recall her?
Could you find out a name or where she lived?
Let me see.
Her name is Ko...
Minami... I suppose.
She lived in Yamaguchi
Prefecture.
Or thereabouts.
Was she a good woman?
She worked hard. I can see her in the front seat of a car.
He won't return until you console her spirit.
Will you try hard to remember who she is?
A woman...?
I can't remember any woman...
The unhappy spirit of a woman haunts him.
He can't love women because of this unhappy spirit.
Where is the medium from?
From Sanjo.
She said that our female ancestor... threw herself in front of a train.
We must console her spirit at a temple.
If she stops haunting him, he'll come back.
So the medium said.
Since he is haunted by her and other spirits... he has problems with women.
The medium said so.
Do you believe such a story?
Believe it or not, I must do what the medium said.
How about you?
I don't really know for sure.
I believe in the spirits... but I try to follow them.
When my mother's spirit told us where he was,
I quickly rushed there.
I prayed to god and the medium to get my son back.
I thought I shouldn't make a fuss.
- The same medium?
- Yes.
We shouldn't blow things out of proportion.
We must wait for the right time to come.
Is what the medium says right?
Yes. She is almost always right.
Yes, always right.
At least now we know he is fine.
She said he wouldn't contact us.
I sure appreciate you helping us with Tadashi.
When he hears how you've worked for us like this... when he sees this on TV... he might get worried and contact us.
If so, I'd be delighted.
But I won't hold my breath.
If he's determined not to contact us, he never will.
So, we may continue to wait for him in vain.
You believe what the
God said?
You have faith that God will come through?
Though we are afraid that Tadashi will never return,
Yoshie Hayakawa continues to wait for his return.
She still looks for him and is not seeing other men.
What do you think of that?
As for Yoshie... we, as well as Tadashi... are causing trouble for her, so I really am sorry.
I'm just plain angry at
Tadashi.
Yoshie is so kind to you.
Since he left here, I've been worrying about him so much.
He doesn't know how much
I worry about him.
But strangely I have never had a dream about him.
I don't think so.
Tell me an episode about
Tadashi's grandfather.
Well, he won a TV set in a lottery...
That was about 1958.
A little before the marriage of the crown prince.
When he was about to watch it, he remembered a man of higher position in the village had no TV.
Why didn't you watch TV then?
Even a rich family in the village didn't have one.
I felt somewhat quilty about having a TV.
So I gradually became unwilling to watch it.
But everyone knew you'd won it.
Couldn't you put it in that perspective?
No, I couldn't.
Do you think being the first son is a handicap for you?
A handicap?
Yes, I'd say so.
It doesn't pay, I suppose.
- Ever thought of leaving home?
- Yes.
I once left home when I was 16 years old.
No, 18.
I went to Hokkaido.
For how long?
Half a year. Then I was fired.
- What did you do there?
- Civil worker.
Left without notice.
Now... this is Tadashi's brother.
Tadashi embezzled 400,000 yen of company money.
Did he come to consult you about that?
- That was in 1961.
We heard from your mother that you lent some money to him.
How much?
- 100,000 yen.
I see.
Your salary was 15 thousand a month.
So you took the money from your savings?
And lent him 100,000 yen?
The money you saved desperately.
It must have been a hard decision for you?
I was going to marry the next year, so I needed the money.
Tadashi was... how should I say?
I hoped his boss would go easier on him.
I also hoped it would be easier for him to continue working there.
Do you think they're hiding
Tadashi's letters somewhere?
- I don't think so.
- I see.
When I was six,
Tadashi's grandfather disappeared from the village.
Saichiro's mother, the one you saw in the photo, brought Saichiro in to this village when he was four.
So Saichiro's father left his son and wife?
That's right.
So Saichiro was actually an illegitimate child?
Right. He left his family for a woman.
A woman!
Saichiro is such a kind man.
Yes, I really like him.
As the fourth son, Tadashi was given a little more than 1 acre.
Life here would have been difficult for him.
Tadashi went to Tokyo.
The city he dreamed about.
He was cursed with bad luck.
Ostracized by the villagers.
I see.
In rural areas people interfere in one another's business.
Why did the family keep
Tadashi's disappearance a secret?
It is a dishonor.
They're eager to look for him, but they can't make it public.
The family name is all-important.
What Tadashi did doesn't concern the other villagers.
But it's a disgrace to his family.
- Family honor...
...is incredibly important.
Boys who are unlucky in their hometowns... join medium and small-sized companies in the cities.
Thus the family system sustains such companies.
Mr. Takeuchi, Miss Taniguchi,
Mr. Takei...
Good morning.
The words which Mr. Miyanaga heard from his military senior were quite profound.
Let me read them out for you.
"To be thankful begins with gratitude for the normality."
As I always tell you... the rice that you eat every day was produced... by the painstaking labor of farmers throughout the year.
My mother would yell at me when I wasted even a grain of rice.
She insisted that I never waste a grain... since I had never farmed even a grain.
I was separated from my mother at age eight.
But I still remember her words.
So never forget to give gratitude for nature.
Some parents don't impart this to their children.
So in place of your mothers and fathers...
I will tell you myself.
As time passes by after you leave your homes... you gradually become more Ionely.
You starve for human contact.
- Something warm.
- To depend on others.
As the president said, regard him as a father.
Come to depend on him.
We don't like to see our products spoiled... with dust and hairs.
So we pondered what to do.
We decided it best to wrap them in clear plastic.
Unlike other youths in today's world...
Tadashi respected his elders, like people used to.
He didn't regard things too rashly.
He was basically a kind and obedient man.
Even at inconvenient hours, he worked as his boss asked.
He used to work until 11 o'clock when he lived with Mr. Oka.
Did Tadashi lose any chance for promotion with his crime?
I certainly think so.
He really worried about it.
I don't think we gave him a hard time or anything... as other people may think we did.
His conscience was hard enough on him.
He worried about what people thought of him.
Most companies would fire someone like him on the spot, but our company gave him another chance.
We tried to have him return the money from his salary.
He was well taken care of by President Oka.
He was like a father?
Treated almost like a child, even when he reached 30.
He is not a very independent man.
Mr. Oka called him Tadashi?
Yes, first name basis.
Doesn't that show his dependency?
What did you think of him as a co-worker?
Well... I don't think... he wasn't very capable.
- He drank a lot.
- So I hear.
He lacked enthusiasm.
He wasn't very capable.
When he had money, he'd spend it all.
We keep a lot of cash at the office.
Yes, he had a girlfriend.
She worked for a knitting mill nearby.
They planned to get married.
He really didn't love her.
But she sure loved him.
You know Tadashi Oshima?
- Yes I do.
What was he like?
He was kind, but a bit of a wimp.
You worked for a factory near the Oka plant, right?
Hello.
May I ask you a very personal question?
What was the relationship with Oshima?
- She was a year or two older than him?
- Yes... yes.
I advised her to give him up.
He seemed unwilling to marry to her. She was worried.
First impressions tell a lot about a person.
Did he get her pregnant?
There is no doubt.
When you spoke of the pregnancy... the out-of-wedlock pregnancy.
What did he say?
I got angry and demanded to know what his plans were.
He wouldn't answer clearly.
I told my sister that she had no chance with a guy like that.
I told him to at least pay for the abortion.
The madam loved Oshima.
Oshima loved another woman.
It was kind of love triangle.
- No...
- I remember...
When I read his love letters...
From whom?
So who from?
He was blessed, I think.
I have never received such letters!
Women just seem to like him for some reason.
What did they say?
Both of them wrote
"I can't live without you."
Both women wrote the same things.
He was a heavy drinker?
You often drank together?
Yes, he was a customer and a nice guy.
Did he... ever come on to you?
In any way?
I can't really say.
Did he talk about his problems?
He sounded like he wanted to, but he didn't say much.
Did he bring his girl here?
- Yes.
- Who?
Her name... you just said it.
Yes, Kimi.
He introduced Kimiko to me.
He said he'd marry her.
But after all, Kimiko was rejected by Tadashi.
You know Kimiko well.
- Yes, I do.
- Tell me about her.
Very flashy, I remember.
Did Oshima love Kimiko as much as she loved him?
Or did he love her more than she loved him?
Oshima loved her more,
I guess.
I'd like to ask about Kimiko.
Around the time when she quit, on July 15, 1960... did you notice she changed?
What do you mean?
- Her attitude to Oshima.
Kimiko became cold to him.
She became very business-like to him.
What caused this?
She had another boyfriend.
Do you know his name?
Mr. Ozawa.
What does he do?
He's an employee at Sumida Co.
I didn't know about Oshima at all that time.
In the end, my existence hurt Oshima.
If I had only known Oshima and Kimiko were in love...
Of course we talked about us.
We asked Matsumoto for help.
Since I couldn't stand her relationship with Oshima...
I left her.
When Kimiko left Oshima and went home to Iwate... how did he take it?
After we told
Tadashi to give her up... he came downstairs and walked into the kitchen.
Did he look disturbed?
Did he look disturbed?
Was he?
Did he look mad?
He didn't when I saw him upstars.
What did he order?
A bottle of beer?
He asked her to give him bottles to break.
He smashed them and then cried.
Did he get violent?
- He just broke the bottles.
- And he just cried?
He didn't cry out loud.
- He wept.
- Not like a girl.
Did he say "I'll kill Kimiko?"
No, he didn't.
I felt both men were being manipulated by her.
She was playing them off against each other.
Oshima spent all his savings on her.
He thought she betrayed him since he'd trusted her.
He's the type of man who is easily led by others.
He's always being lead by others, I guess.
You loved Tadashi, didn't you?
Yes.
Can such feelings change so quickly?
Do you think my love for him ended so suddenly?
But you didn't tell either of them your feelings.
Can a woman love two men at the same time?
You told Ozawa that you were dating Oshima.
I told him later.
- Later?
- I wrote him a letter.
So why did you come to love Ozawa more than Oshima?
Because Ozawa worked for bigger company.
He's a college graduate, so his future is promising.
Because he's more promising, you were attracted to him?
But you promised to marry
Oshima. You even had a ring.
I want to know how you dropped him.
What prompts such a life?
Such a life?
Let's say, if I were engaged to Tadashi Oshima... and another man appeared...
I could never switch over to the new man.
Were your parents' objections, his future and his embezzlement?
His environment probably formed him... but he looked like such a child.
Always kowtowing to his boss and the boss's wife.
I hated to see him like that.
We heard you were pregnant with his child.
If you find Oshima, you'll learn the truth.
Despite what you may have heard...
I don't sleep around before marriage.
There must be some truth to the story.
I wonder if you have had
Tadashi's child?
When I heard the rumor...
I tried to give him up. He belonged with his child and you.
Why did you get suspicious if you loved Oshima?
It's out of the question.
It happened before I met him.
But you love him now, don't you?
You must believe me that we weren't intimate.
I can't believe that.
Me, neither.
I wan't to find Oshima to ask about it.
So do I.
The saying goes
"No smoke without fire."
I can't believe the rumor is totally false.
I've nothing more to say.
I think you are close to his ideal type of woman.
What do you think, Kimiko?
I don't really think I was his type.
I've never thought about it.
What do you think of me searching for Oshima?
I think you love him and want to marry him.
But I doubt he will be happy if he found out.
That's what I suspect.
You mean if I find him, it may annoy him?
I don't know, really don't know.
You mean because he has probably started a new life?
Yes.
But with the guilt of betraying her and the embezzlement... how can he start a happy life?
I think such a life would be very fragile.
How could he show his face?
And he should say clearly to me,
"There's another woman I love."
"So I can't marry you."
Like a man.
If he left because of this engagement to you...
I wonder if that's because he couldn't forget Kimiko?
Makes me wonder if I'm so unattractive.
You shouldn't blame yourself.
Yes.
At least he's not with Kimiko.
She doesn't know where he is.
He may have another woman, or just feel guilt over the money.
Did Yoshie find the hidden camera?
She saw it when she entered the room.
When she got excited, she forgot about it, though.
How about Kimiko?
She didn't notice it.
Did she say she knew where
Oshima was?
She said she knew things that we don't know.
Here is the progression of his last known movements.
Oshima was last seen in this vicinity.
As far as we can gather.
In Fukushima.
He may have said something about where he was.
He went to Shirakawa,
Koriyama, then Fukushima.
And Inawashiro, Wakamatsu
Aizu-Wakamatsu was the last place, right?
Something may have happened.
We want to know what.
Let's investigate it thoroughly.
We may find something about Kimiko, too.
It was April 15.
In 1965.
April 15, 1965.
Do you give checks or cash?
We always deal in checks.
What time was it?
I think it was around noon.
Was Oshima the salesman-type?
We didn't meet each other so often...
He didn't give off a strong impression.
He was hardly suited for sales.
He didn't come in April.
- But every month previously?
- Yes. He came on a business trip every month.
- But not last April.
- Right.
When he came here,
I often...
He always came in the evenings.
After work, we often went out to drink.
We often walked in the crowded streets.
We often drank together.
You like drinking?
- Yes, I do.
I heard Mr. Oshima likes to drink.
Did he drink much?
Yes, he drank a lot.
Oshima went out to drink with you.
We walked all over.
Once I start, I like to visit a few places.
We don't go to any shady places, though.
You sometimes danced?
Yes, he danced.
I heard he was popular.
Yes, he was very popular with the girls.
So you paid, but the girls went for Oshima.
He was popular because he was quiet.
- Are quiet men always popular?
- Well, quite often, yes.
He always worried about his hair.
I don't have much left though.
He had a lot of hair. He always looked neat, his hair done.
A pompadour?
- Yes.
He never failed to do his hair.
It never looked messy.
Didn't he like women?
He also had his feelings.
That kind of man tends to be dangerous.
- Did he drink here often?
- Yes, I think so.
How many times did he come?
- A couple of times, I guess.
- I see.
KAIZO ITO, GIFU PLASTIC CO.
The two have been drinking here?
Ito said he's from Tokyo?
He and Oshima came here and chatted over drinks.
I don't recall if he said he was from Tokyo.
Did they talk about Tokyo?
I didn't listen.
- Ito works near Oshima's place.
- That sounds right.
You heard them say so?
I had other customers.
Their way of talking made me believe they were friends.
Just the way they talked together.
Thank you.
Why didn't he go to Kimura in April?
He went to 3 places on the 15th.
So he was in Fukushima.
We aren't sure about the 15th and the 16th.
But after the 17th he visited his regular places.
We'll learn more in Kunimi.
April 17, 1965, right?
The places Oshima visited.
How did he pay the bill?
With a check issued by the
Kangyo Bank in Fukushima.
- He paid by check?
- Yes.
We want to know whether he withdrew money from the bank.
We don't know about before he came to see us.
He had enough time to,
I suppose.
Yes, On April, 17th... yes.
Issuing check.
The issuing number was
008574, out of Gifu.
We were surprised to learn that Oshima is missing.
He didn't appear to be acting strangely.
When he showed us the products.
He sent the money he collected on the 16th.
The 16th is the settlement date.
He kept the date, which proves he didn't go crazy.
And he cashed the check of the 17th, right?
When I checked our books... our Honjo office asked our branch to remit the money... to the Honjo Branch in Tokyo.
Endorsed by the Oka Company.
It means the check was not cashed here.
He could have cashed the check if he tried to.
- But he didn't have money.
- But he didn't cash the check.
It is strange.
We must investigate about events in Wakamatsu.
When I looked at the photo,
I think... he might have been here, but we have no record.
Salesmen are likely to disappear suddenly.
It happens once every year or two.
It is not so unusual.
So I don't pay much attention to such cases.
He didn't visit any clients where they pay by check.
He thought of going somewhere in Wakamatsu.
You are right.
What time was it?
- It was...
- Around noon.
How did he look then?
Just as usual, I think.
But I found... as he left us... he looked at the clock and said he'd catch the express.
He asked me to call a taxi.
What taxi company?
- Wakamatsu Taxi.
I felt strange, because he always walked to the station.
That was the last
I saw of him.
- The taxi came soon?
- Yes.
- Did he head for the station?
- He said so.
- He went in that direction.
- Yes, he did.
He said he would take the express to Tokyo... which departs at 2.00 or 3.00.
He didn't look hurried.
He looked Ionely if you ask me.
He sat there.
He looked at this schedule.
And he looked up and down, like this.
In hindsight, he looked Ionely to me.
So he took a train to
Ueno, Tokyo?
No one takes the expresses just to Fukushima.
- How about a car?
- No.
He has broad eyebrows and is tanned by the snow.
We're trying to find out more than just his looks.
People can't remember faces in such a short time.
Too many people to find.
Is this your record of fares?
This one went to Suehiro-cho
Station.
So you drove Mr. Oshima to the station after this one?
Well... it was two years ago.
So, about 3:00 on the 13th you drove the passenger from Nakado to Suehiro-cho?
Yes, I did.
Where did he go after he got out of your cab?
He asked me to wait and headed for the bar.
And then?
He came back and paid me the fare.
Then he went back into the bar.
We don't get many young customers here.
Why not try
Higashiyama Springs?
We've got information about him in Fukushima.
But little of it is useful.
No news about the 16th.
We can only try to track his movements.
It's starting to become like an investigation.
It could look that way.
He was probably mixed up with a woman.
I understand.
The fact that he was so stressed out... tells us that he yearned for something.
I wonder if the woman called
Nezumi comforted Oshima.
He wasn't comforted by her.
I suspect he had another woman who was understanding.
I also suspect she's involved with the events of the 16th.
- In Tokyo?
- Yes.
He didn't have the time to know a woman.
He remitted money and left his bag.
He probably planned everything beforehand.
If he had planned it, he could have gone earlier.
Yes, he didn't plan what he did.
We must look deeply and then focus on... his feelings and any changes to his feelings.
We must approach it from the view of our film-making.
We must come up with more useful information.
We should be bold.
So he must be in Tokyo with a woman.
When did you check Oshima's room?
That was the 26th.
This was Mr. Oshima's room.
- May I go in?
- Sure.
We found checks and his job record in this closet.
His samples case?
Around here, on this shelf.
I see.
Have you got yours?
May we see it?
Not that way.
Yes, that's it.
Should be easy to find.
I was away for 4 days from the 23rd.
- 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th... it was...
- I came back on the 26th.
The 25th was a Sunday.
Everyone was here.
So it was the 23rd or the 24th.
Why did he come back here?
If he had a woman in Tokyo... he came to get something that concerned her.
- It must have concerned her...
- You know anything about that?
He must have had a reason to disappear.
He couldn't get away from his responsibilities as a salesman.
That's one of his biggest problems.
It's a big part of his makeup.
It does look like him.
Miss Hayakawa found the photo.
The nose is similar.
The cheek bones are distinctive.
The body was found on June 13th.
This river usually has a good view.
A body usually surfaces after a week or so... if it flows into this river.
This body does closely resemble the photograph.
The physique, face, cheeks are all alike.
His trousers and sash were at his feet.
From looking at the body, he's probably only 17 or 18.
I'm afraid the body is not
Mr. Oshima's.
The last time you saw him was...
April 3rd, 1965.
Is that right, Mr. Kasahara?
Yes, before I played golf, so it was a Saturday.
You promised to meet and go drinking with him.
We hadn't met for so long.
- This was the 2nd bar that night.
- Yes.
This is his fiancée, Ms. Yoshie.
Did he mention anything about her that night?
He said he didn't want to marry for the time being.
He didn't want to marry anytime soon.
Did you know he was engaged?
Yes, he went to see his parents,
I heard.
To say he was not willing to marry?
Yes, he told them so.
Did you talk only about the engagement?
No, about other things, too.
- But he didn't want to marry?
- No, he didn't.
Did he talk about it?
He said that before he knew it the engagement was all fixed.
The woman herself was good, but her sister wasn't legally married.
And he said he didn't want to marry into that.
That's what he said at first.
He said... It is hard to say this, but... his fiancée's sister is someone's lover, not legally married.
He didn't want to run into her when he visited his fiancée.
So... he didn't want to visit his fiancée.
That's what he said.
- I see.
- That's what I remember.
I told him to separate the two issues.
Think about your fiancée, not about her sister.
I told him the problem was between him and Yoshie.
When was that?
It was in 1965. I think it was the month before he actually disappeared.
One month before...?
I think it was
Feb. Or March.
His fiancée's sister is someone's lover, not legally married.
He didn't want to run into her when he visited his fiancée.
He said that he didn't want to marry soon.
I wonder if the woman called
Nezumi comforted him?
I don't think there was anything going on...
I tried not to listen to what
I didn't want to hear.
I tried to ignore a lot.
I don't want to admit certain things.
Oshima knew that you lived with a boyfriend?
Do you depend on him financially?
I am not sure what you mean
"to depend on financially."
Oshima worried about this a lot.
Does that concern indicate it was true?
I am not sure.
Be more frank.
Why would Oshima worry about that so much?
Who is this man in your life?
If Oshima disappeared because of me, it would be a big problem.
But at the time you never suspected?
I have a short temper, especially if I drink.
Why shouldn't she have a lover?
But I don't know if she depends on him.
Well, she said so.
I know that now, but
I've never asked her about boyfriends and money...
But you should have known what Oshima knew.
It's only natural.
Why didn't you know?
Did you know about it?
When we went out to dinner, we ran into Oshima once.
It was before Yoshie came home from work.
- By chance?
- Yes.
And then?
I don't remember what happened next.
We just ran into him.
Did you talk?
Well, we didn't avoid him.
Do you think Yoshie would be happy if she married Oshima?
Couples don't feel true happiness, without living together for some years.
They have to argue at first, like all other couples.
Couples should cover their mutual defects, I believe.
Was he jealous because Oshima and Yoshie got on so well?
I don't think so. I was just happy being with them.
She kept sticking to us.
A bit of an exaggeration!
I enjoyed the atmosphere.
- The athmosphere...
- Yes, right...
The general atmosphere of it.
But it annoyed you?
I would never "serve" him, like women do.
You should do it naturally.
No time for that! You kept pouring his drinks all night.
To be honest, yes.
So I just sat there pouting, watching TV.
You said I'd been cold to him after he left.
We didn't need to fight for him, you know.
That's why I just kept watching TV.
I should have been more considerate.
"He isn't your husband" is what I wanted to say.
I had many other things to say to you.
When I said take a bath, you said it was too cold.
I was always alone...
So when we had visitors...
- You enjoyed being with them?
- Right.
Yes. I wasn'tjealous, because they were on such good terms.
I want Mr. Oshima to come right out... and say he doesn't want to marry me any more...
Who knows where he is?
He may have someone...
How shall I put this?
He may be living happily now.
I think if that were true, then it is a real sin.
What do you mean?
Lf, as a result of your search... you find him living someplace happily.
He may be unable to face things... and he may have no place to turn to.
I just worry that he may commit suicide.
This may sound cold...
But I worry about Mr. Oshima rather than blaming him.
It's sinful that I may drive him to suicide.
If you did, I'd feel sorry and sad because I'm your sister.
So don't kill yourself.
I won't because that's more embarrassing.
It's not easy to commit suicide.
I'll survive even if someone tries to kill me.
You must find happiness.
But happiness built on an unstable base is quite fragile.
However poor you may be... you may feel a happiness that you can't express.
I really think so.
My face seems to have hardened.
I've noticed it myself.
If no one was here,
I'd beat her.
You'd beat your sister?
I know it would get me nowhere.
- Why do you want to beat her?
- She's so dirty.
- You say she's dirty?
- Yes!
Underhanded?
Everyone is, including you.
That's enough.
You object to your sister being supported by a man?
No more. Please leave.
I want to be alone.
You really hate your sister that much?
- Yes, I do.
- Why is that?
Some trouble from when you were kids?
I don't now.
You look quite upset now.
I really find it hard to understand... why you hate her so much.
What is it, then?
You don't seem to understand her at all.
It is strange.
About Yoshie and her sister,
Sayo...
They've been on bad terms since childhood.
They were evacuated from town during the war.
Yoshie really hated her sister very much.
For no real reason she'd often beat her.
Sayo didn't hit back at Yoshie, or tell her to stop it.
So it's like Yoshie always lords it over Sayo.
Of course Sayo is older than Yoshie.
Yoshie has a short temper.
She was opposed to living in Asakusa with Sayo, and being supported...
...financially, by her.
They lived together for a while.
It was just after she got engaged to Tadashi.
That's right.
- Yoshie was...
- Strong-willed!
Look, don't tell anybody.
When we had an argument... she'd pull my hair.
Once she bit me until I bled.
That's how she was!
If you allow me to use the word, 'hatred'... did you ever feel a physical revulsion towards her?
Once-quite disgusting. See, we'd never slept together before... and her breasts would touch up against me.
Real soft and bouncy, like the texture ofjelly.
Apparently the Hayakawa family descends from Samurai.
Yes, from Shibata, Niigata Pref.
- Yoshie's father is...?
- 10th generation, I think.
What was your grandfather?
The firstjudge of the
Shibata Court.
This Hayakawa family chonicle was written by your father?
Yes, he rewrote an earlier one from the 9th generation.
I heard the original was destroyed by fire.
Your father seems to have put many stories in the family memo.
Yoshie tells me that he was strict.
Yes, he was.
Strict and puritan,
I heard.
Can you tell me an episode that shows him in that light?
Let me see.
It was one year before he died.
He took out an antique, heirloom sword he'd inherited.
He asked me to pawn the sword for him.
- A family treasure?
- Yes.
But the pawn shop owner lent us money without me... having to give up the sword.
"Not with a family treasure" he said.
So my husband put it aside reverently.
But even months before he died, he started to worry about it.
He asked the pawnshop owner to take the sword.
He couldn't pay him.
You think Yoshie takes after your husband?
Yes, both are strong and puritan.
What's your mother like?
Quite slovenly, I think.
I guess I take after my mother.
My dead sister often said
I was just like mother.
Of them all, Sayo is the most warm-hearted.
She's been very kind to me and our family.
Over the years
I've observed them.
Sayo has always been the kindest of them all.
When Tadashi saw Yoshie and her sister talking... he felt Yoshie spoke far too straightforwardly.
He wished that Yoshie was as gentle as her sister.
It's shameful to say, but Sayo entered into the Willow World.
As an apprentice geisha.
So Sayo studied to be a geisha and Yoshie didn't like it.
Yoshie didn't want anyone to know about it at all.
She didn't want any disgrace for her family.
Sayo moved in here because she disliked that geisha house.
As we were short-handed,
I employed her.
- It was when she was 20 or 21.
- That's right.
Then what?
Then, she said she wanted to be a geisha.
- Her own choice?
- Yes.
I still don't know why
I wanted to be one.
I just wanted not to bother anybody and be independent.
But my skills as a geisha didn't improve much... because I was just coasting.
A quiet girl.
- Was she ever in love?
- Never! She's not the type.
Honest and sincere?
As much as a geisha can be!
Compared to the other geisha, she was.
It was pitiful. She had no choice but to enter the life.
Was she attractive?
Not particularly attractive, she really wasn't cut out for it.
How did you get to know Sayo?
One month after I opened the Yukara...
I was short-handed, so I called her to work there.
- The Yukara is a bar?
- Yes.
- It used to be here.
- Yes.
- You owned the bar?
- Not really.
After that...?
After I sold the bar?
She lost herjob, so I told her to became a driver.
Because you can live off it till you're at least 50.
She took a long time to get her driver's license.
She's been working as a driver for more than two years now.
Miss Hayakawa, if Mr. Oshima shows up... would you still want to marry to him?
It would be difficult.
It depends on whether he still loves me.
I don't necessarily want him to come back for me.
I'd rather he returned for his aged parents' sake.
That sounds very noble.
But it suggests that you're just trying to look good.
And this search is really for your own sake.
Not for his aged parents.
After 3 months of investigation, do you know why he vanished?
Did anyone object to filming the search for him?
Did you agree to the director's offer simply in order to find him?
So Yoshie and Sayo lived up on the fifth floor, right?
Right.
So Oshima was a constant visitor.
It's important to the story.
That's the train line.
The station on our right.
Nezumi is good in front of a camera.
A real actress.
She knows all the poses.
Just after Oshima disappeared,
Nezumi, "The Rat", told us that her sister was suspicious of her.
I could be wrong, but maybe she plotted the whole thing between her and her sister.
It's a possibility...
Led to an interview by an actress called "Rat!"
You're saying it's all fiction...?
No, our film's non-fiction.
But...
For example, the hatred towards Kimiko and Nezumi's hatred of Sayo... since childhood, are on the same line.
Or a sex-related, inferiority complex. With complications.
Well, who was it who said that earlier...?
To investigate the relationship between sisters is meaningful.
As we delve deeper, the truth may become known.
The whole thing strikes me like it's a double image.
Any proof?
She does look at herself quite objectively.
But sometimes she makes me unsure.
Which is the real one?
It's like she's acting the part of herself.
She sees herself as The Rat.
We need Oshima's version.
We surely do!
More than anything.
- They looked like husband and wife?
- I thought so.
The old man said when he rented the room... he wanted his employees to stay here when traveling.
When they came from elsewhere they'd stay there.
It would certainly save them paying for hotels.
- So you rented it to him?
- Yes.
Afterwards, I sometimes saw a woman with a wig box.
About "The Rat", Miss Hayakawa... so you feel she's changed recently?
Is she starting to like you?
Yes... well... I can't...
I can't deny what you say.
During our investigation...
Since that TV coverage,
Since then... just being on
TV had an influence...
There's a definite excitement...
I felt something... how can I describe it...?
She's weakened.
She seems to have lost her zeal to find him.
Originally she wanted to find him.
But if she's fallen in love with you...
She has no reason to keep looking for Oshima.
That's what we've noticed.
Basically I'm on her side.
But if it is true, I mean, if she does love me...
It would be rather an awkward situation, a bad feeling.
But it is quite a new and a solid fact.
I'd like to push this research a bit further.
It is as if the distance between
Oshima and me has increased.
Since when?
I can't remember. Sometime during these past 6 months.
Before I started the film,
I thought I could never forget him.
But after all the difficulties, maybe I can.
How about seeing him now?
I think I could muster up a smile for him.
He has become a memory to me.
See the crow.
- I don't like them.
- You don't like crows?
The reason you hate them, is itjust a feeling?
- Yes, something...
- You hate crows.
They're so grotesque.
This place makes me forget my everyday worries.
I wish I didn't have to work.
Why did you fall in love with me?
I don't know.
Since when?
I don't know. I think at first it was because I was Ionely.
I felt empty,
I still feel that emptiness.
Who do you love more,
Oshima or me?
Currently I'd have to say it's you.
But I may fall for another man in the future.
What you said to me... reminds me of what you were criticizing earlier.
It's totally different from what you just said now.
I don't mean to criticize you, but...
I think people sometimes theatrically produce themselves.
They perform according to that which they, themselves, plot.
I feel...
I love only you, but...
I think that frowning on a love for 2 people is far too narrow.
And before that?
Even before I loved only you.
Or, I made myself believe it's only you.
That may be a conceited view.
If I must leave you, it will be against my will.
I thought I should do volunteer work.
Go someplace where I won't be in need of someone else.
For the rest of my life I won't be the Yoshie you think you know.
I'll be nothing but a worker in a group.
I thought that's probably the best thing for me.
Recently, however, I've begun to pity such a life.
I feel I deserve some love.
What shocked me was... how my sister got suspicious... that there was something between Oshima and me.
I couldn't figure out why she even pictured us like that.
At the time she acted strange towards me.
But different to how she was strange yesterday.
I was quite shocked.
So shocked that I discussed it with my boss.
I never noticed how she felt about us.
He agreed if he saw us like that, he'd be suspicious, too.
But I was shocked.
Is it Tadashi?
It is him, right?
Please don't ask me anything.
Everyone is worried about you.
Why can't you go back?
- I just can't.
- Why not?
- They want you to.
- You're alive, aren't you?
Well are you?
Are you dead?
That's right.
Yes, I am dead.
When did you die?
Three months ago.
Where did you die?
Don't ask me anything.
It's too late now.
Please don't ask me anything.
Murder or suicide?
You can't know my pain.
I had a nightmare last night.
I was chasing after two white cats with a knife and...
I slashed at them with the knife.
Then I put the half-dead cats in a wooden box.
I banged the wooden lid onto the box.
While the cats desperately tried to escape.
I was hammering a nail onto the cover.
It was too long and it went through cat's head, into it's eye.
I shuddered to realize that I have such cruelty within me.
She used to come to do her hair once a week.
She said she was learning to drive.
She hasn't been here since then.
Did you know her occupation?
She looked like a mistress, someone's lover.
I doubt that she worked.
Anything unusual about her?
Every visit she made a phone call.
Where is the phone?
It's in the back.
She said her sister visited her on Sundays.
I see.
So she mentioned you.
I think she meant we lived separately.
Right. That fits.
She didn't want to say you lived together.
That's right.
I heard the door open,
I saw her at the entrance.
She was with a man.
I asked who he was and she said it was her brother.
I remember he looked young, like a student.
You saw his face?
Yes, when he turned around.
I saw both of them.
What I remember is his broad eyebrows.
- This is him?
- Yes!
Where did you see him?
You know where the train line crosses?
There used to be a bicycle-trailer shop there.
It was by the shop.
I remember I was on my bike.
Not many people about...
He looked away, so I thought he knew me.
- Knew you?
- Yes.
The woman in the photo you showed me.
Yes, her.
She was walking with him.
I remember quite well, that means I saw them 3-4 times.
When was this?
Well... it was...
He was in a polo-shirt, so that means...
Have to be summer.
- I think so.
Would you say it was the summer of 1964?
She lived in that building since 1964.
And she moved out in
November, 1966.
I do remember he was always dressed drably.
- Wearing a polo shirt?
- Yes.
That makes it tough.
Which one did you see?
The one on the left or the right?
- The one on the right.
- The one on the right.
- It was her with him?
- Yes, definitely.
I just can't imagine why they'd be out walking together.
- No mistake?
- No.
How did they seem?
Well, at first I thought they were brother and sister.
Not from their conversation, more from their gestures.
How closely did they walk together?
Normal distance.
They weren't in arm in arm.
Were they trying to avoid being seen?
Rather than that, they looked very serious.
Serious, you say?
And they were talking?
Yes, they were talking.
Men often meet your gaze but he didn't notice me.
It's a narrow street.
Your sister poisoned him.
- Poisoned him...
- Killed by poison?
Yes.
She killed him with poison.
The spirit saw it all.
Why did her sister kill Tadashi?
You should know the answer.
As you well know, he was her sister's fiance.
They had intimate relations.
That is what a man should not do.
Why did she kill him?
She wanted to have all his love.
Don't you understand?
She wanted him.
She killed him because she couldn't have him.
It is too late now.
She poisoned him and he is no longer with us.
It is too late.
- Where did she kill him?
- What a question! You should know.
- I should know it?
- Yes.
- Why should I?
- Why shouldn't you?
You're her sister.
Ask her yourself!
- Ask my sister?
- Yes.
She knows well?
Yes, it is a simple matter.
I want to know the truth.
Will you be honest?
About what?
Well...
Did you ever call Tadashi while he was at work?
No, I never did.
- Not even once?
- Never.
Why?
Did he ever call you?
- Never, not once.
How would he know how to contact me?
Did you ever visit him at his office?
Did you ever go there?
I had my shop to go to, so I sometimes did.
After the bankruptecy?
No, after that I had no reason to.
Until I started working in
Kanda again.
Did you ever meet him at the mezzanine?
There's no mezzanine there.
Ah, yes, there was one.
Did you ever call him from there?
No, because I don't know his phone number.
I know it now because I often call there nowadays.
The operator remembers your voice.
Never! I want to see her and confirm that.
I couldn't have called,
I didn't know his number.
I had no need to call him.
When did you work there as an telephone operator?
From Oct, 1964...
- Where you still there when
Oshima disappeared?
- Yes, I was.
Did he get calls from women?
A couple of times.
Do you recognize the voice?
No, they're different.
Where did she call from?
I don't know that. I thought it was Fujikoki, or Kanda.
Fujikoki or Kanda...
Did she give her name?
Miss Hayakawa, she said.
Hayakawa?
You were in Kawasaki.
Was it me, from Kaukasuu?
I couldn't very sure, but I thought it was Kanda.
I see. Can you compare my voice with the voice you heard?
Completely different.
I see.
Listen again.
All right.
I'm going out tomorrow afternoon.
How about the next day?
I'll be gone for two days.
Well I'm not coming back until Monday.
I see.
How about that?
Did it sound familiar?
Yes, it does.
What's her name?
It's the Miss Hayakawa I know.
She sounds different to how I do?
Very different.
That's the evidence,
I never phoned.
First, I had no reason to.
Yes. That's why I asked.
I really don't think people can remember voices after one call.
It'd take a few times before you'd remember.
She remembers your voice.
So you often called him.
Which other Hayakawa could it be?
I really don't know.
Let's leave that for now.
I'm offended that you're suspicious of me.
While I was out... did Tadashi ever come and visit our old place?
Never in the daytime.
Just that one time when we got confused about stations.
- That was at night.
- Yes.
The only other time was... when my boss asked you and me to dinner.
Tadashi and you asked me to dinner on the same day.
Just those two times.
- That was at night, too.
- Yes.
He was seen entering the building a few times during the day.
How can you explain that?
He never came to my room.
I wasn't at home.
I was working.
He may have come while
I was out. But I didn't see him.
Why would he, if I wasn't home?
What did he visit you for?
How would I know?
I'm not Oshima.
I never met him without you.
And I really hate your questions.
I can't understand why you keep questioning me.
Ever seen this man here?
Once... no, a couple of times.
Your customer?
He never came to the shop, no.
When I was out delivering, I saw him under the railway line.
He looked away, so
I thought he might know me.
The other time was when I was making deliveries.
I saw him leaving the
Sawara building.
He hurried away as if he didn't want anyone to spot him.
That made me think we knew each other.
Do you know this woman?
I know her, she's a customer.
She often walks past here.
Going to the hair dresser, I think.
I saw her walking with him.
- Together?
- Yes.
Was it in summer?
Two or three years ago.
They were walking together.
Walking together on the same street as her building.
I was coming out of the street opposite and I saw them.
30 meters ahead of me.
Was that in winter?
How do you explain this?
I was never out with him.
You know the fish shop called "Ototoya?"
Yes, I do.
You always buy fish there.
He knows you, so he isn't mistaken.
Yes, but I never...
- You never walked with a young man?
- No, never.
It was you. Otherwise it's just far too coincidental.
That wasn't me.
If you insist,
I should believe you... but everyone we asked said they saw you two together.
How do you explain that?
- Ask the people downstairs.
You have to pass by them on the way up here.
I never saw them in their office.
In summer they left the door open.
They'd see me every time.
I even joked about them "guarding" the entrance.
I never saw anyone from there when I lived here.
You weren't here in the daytime.
What about when I took time off from work?
You stayed in your room.
I went out once in the daytime when
Tadashi and I visited his sister.
I was never with a young man.
I don't know any young men.
I can't imagine what happened during the day.
My boss sometimes visited me.
I never saw Tadashi in a polo shirt.
Neither did I.
Then why was he spotted coming out of the place?
I really don't know.
If it was just the once, it could be a mistake.
But he was spotted more than once.
How should I know?
But...
I really don't know.
I want to make that clear.
Me, too. That's why I'm here talking to you.
I don't care about work.
I want to see these people making the allegations.
Please do!
I think you know something about his disappearance.
Did he talk it over with you?
Why would he?
Now I wish he had come over.
If he had, I could tell you why he vanished.
You shouldn't be so suspicious.
I didn't want to.
That's why I've waited.
I'm offended that you doubt me.
And upset that everyone says they saw me with him.
So meet them and talk to them.
I want the truth to come out.
I don't want to distrust my sister.
But everyone is pointing the finger at you.
I want the truth to come out.
You know that I'm not the flashy type.
If I were, then sure, go ahead and criticize me.
I hate that they speak ill of me!
Especially to you!
Do you remember when
I went to Kofu?
Yes, I do.
I've carried this since then.
I felt something was strange when you asked me about
Tadashi and I back then.
- I wondered why.
- I never mentioned it then!
Come in.
Please.
- Thank you.
Do you remember him?
- No, I don't.
- You remember me?
- Yes, when I saw your photo.
Do I look the same now?
Was it me?
Well, what should I say?
You often walked past my shop, so I remember you.
What was I wearing?
Well, as I remember...
You didn't wear make-up.
- You remember the hairdresser?
- What was I wearing?
- I can't remember...
- Not my face, my clothes.
What I remember was...
A cardigan. It was a cardigan, or something like that.
What kind of cardigan?
I don't mind being suspected.
I'm just telling the truth.
I'm not making up a story.
It's true.
Is that the photo he saw?
Yes, this is the one.
When was it taken?
The last time we met.
I'm so ugly.
- And this one.
Is that what I look like?
Yes, it looks very natural.
You weren't aware you were being photographed.
This one convinces me that it was her.
My hair was never like that back then. You're mistaken.
- That photo
- With Tadashi.
He has characteristic features.
It would be natural for me to be seen with him.
So I wouldn't try to hide it, would I?
Let's examine that, then.
Do you know him?
Who?
Pass him the photo.
Yes. I remember him well.
No mistake.
- Only once?
- How many times?
A couple of times.
- But...
- Or maybe even more.
- Where did you see him?
- The bike-trailer show.
- Bike-trailer?
- Near the bridge.
Well...
Then how about the Okuma
Pawn shop?
I don't know it.
The first time, he was on the street.
But he looked away from me.
He wouldn't meet my eyes.
I thought maybe I knew him.
Quite often I don't remember customers.
But they remember me and say hello.
That's what I thought it was.
Funnily enough,
I don't remember your face.
Well, they're my customers, so I try to remember them.
If they shop at my store
I usually do remember them.
I don't usually forget either, when it's work related.
That's why I don't remember you.
The other times?
You know Kanayama's place?
- Yes, I know it.
- I was making a delivery.
After I called Kanayama on the intercom,
I was waiting there at the door.
I saw him leave your building and head for the bridge.
Then I remembered.
You mean Tadashi, not me?
Yes, Mr. Oshima.
Why would he be going towards the bridge?
- He always took the train.
- And the next time?
I saw you and him meet, then walk off together.
Where was this?
You know Suzutake's place just down the road?
The only time I ever went that way was to pay the rent.
Otherwise, I had no reason to pass by there.
When was this?
And what were they wearing?
Well. You know... I've never seen her dressed in kimono.
I just remember her in a cardigan.
And him, this man, was in a polo-shirt... or a sweater.
The sleeves tucked up above the elbow.
I remember the short-sleeves.
That wasn't me.
You're sure it was Oshima?
I'm positive.
His face is hard to mistake.
Look again, please.
The other one reminds me more.
- Was there another man?
- No, never.
I never had any reason to walk that way.
He says he saw you.
That's strange.
- How often did you see her?
- At least three times.
Maybe even more.
Was it on Sundays?
Or weekdays?
I was working, so it wasn't a Sunday.
Very few people about.
Not many people go there in the daytime.
I was making a delivery, so it must have been daytime.
- Around noon?
- From noon to two or three.
Three at latest.
And you saw her?
- Yes.
- How about the man?
No mistake. My first impression of him was a strong one.
Those broad eyebrows.
They're very noticeable.
- Yours are, too.
- That's why I remember him.
You're absolutely sure it was him?
No mistake. I don't remember what you wore though.
That's not so important.
I wear both kimono and western clothes.
Maybe you forgot?
No, I was never out walking with him.
It doesn't make sense.
This and that phone call business.
He has nothing to gain by lying.
That's right.
I'm not a man to make up stories or tell lies.
I have no connection with this case at all.
I'm only here to help you find him.
So I'm just telling you the truth.
I've no reason to lie.
It wasn't me with Tadashi like he says.
It's a complete mystery how he could have seen us like that.
I know you all think I'm just covering up.
But it's as much a mystery to me too.
You maintain it wasn't you.
But the fishmonger says he saw you. Both can't be right.
But it wasn't me!
Someone's lying.
But it wasn't me.
But the fishmonger...
He's positive.
I'm positive, too.
How can this happen?
Look, I'm not mistaken.
Okay?
Then what is the truth?
We don't know.
I just told you the truth.
The three times I remember.
It may have been more.
But I don't know.
I just remember those times.
I never expected this.
Just remember I'm telling you the truth.
I've no reason to lie.
Director.
What is the truth?
I don't know, either.
That's why I want to probe for the real truth.
I don't know what truth is.
I can't tell whether
Sayo is telling the truth, or if the fishmonger is
Only I know the truth.
No, you probably don't know either.
Nobody knows the truth.
Pull the set down!
What you're trying to say,
Truth is accompanied by the realization that "this is true."
Although I also don't know the truth here, that itself is a truth.
For instance, this is a stage set.
No ceiling or roof.
But you all talked as if it really was a cozy room.
This set took on the life of a real room.
When in actual fact this "room" is just a set in a studio.
One's feelings cannot be trusted.
This is fiction.
This drama originated from
Mr. Oshima's disappearance.
This story develops along somewhat unnatural lines.
It develops as we intended.
Lights!
Itjust means...
The camera films.
You are filmed by the camera.
Other filmmakers will make other fake stories here.
But we are unable to tell which is true and which is false.
Ours is a fictitious story, too.
We start with an "action", and a clapboard.
This is obviously a drama.
It's not a documentary.
It is a dramatization which asks the reasons why so many people just vanish in this tiny country of ours.
Please understand that this is pure drama, a fictitious story.
Will you tell us some real facts?
Last year, 91,000 people were officially reported as missing.
This year we expect an increase.
Today I'd like you to help us to learn the truth.
This is Mr. Asanami who works in the building Sayo lives in.
Hello, everyone.
Will you tell us what you saw at that time?
Sayo, do you know him?
Yes, sort of.
You know my sister.
How about you, Sayo?
It's been so long.
- Remember his face?
I don't remember his face that well.
Tell us what you saw.
I'll be the man with her.
Round about here.
The man was in front.
They used that other door.
You were inside.
Locked?
It should be open.
The door was open.
Close this one?
Will you go up?
I need one more person.
One more, please.
Not so far up.
I noticed the woman passing here.
And...
I greeted her,
I said hello.
Then I asked you who the man was.
You said that he was your brother.
You know me, why did you ask me who I was?
No, I asked about the man with you.
The one who went ahead.
You asked her who was the man in front of her?
A question, right?
I was asked to remember what I saw.
I maintain that what you "saw", never happened.
You say we've never met, right?
No, we've met.
What you saw didn't happen.
If I'd been with him, you'd never have asked who he was.
- No doubt.
- So you did see them?
But you deny it.
You say it wasn't you.
The man was Tadashi Oshima.
No doubt about that?
I don't think I am mistaken.
Nothing is 100%, you know.
I just happened to see a woman who regularly visited my shop.
How old did the man look?
He was young.
But you said you had no male visitors.
He saw you and a man walking down the street.
But it wasn't me.
I have to believe him.
Yoshie, don't be so subjective!
It was two years ago.
His memory of it isn't fresh.
His memory has naturally become dim, right?
I remember what really concerns me, but...
When I saw the picture,
I easily recognized him.
- So you saw them walking?
- Yes. I saw them here.
Can you be sure it was me?
Not definitely, no.
- That's what I wanted.
- I'm losing confidence...
He saw them, but he can't definitely say it was them.
And we can say the same thing about Sayo, can't we?
Maybe she's mistaken, maybe it was her.
If it had been someone he knew well, like his sister, a relative, or maybe an old girlfriend.
His memories would be clear, even after two years.
But he saw a man and one of his customers.
It is no wonder that his memory of it is unclear.
Were you ever with Tadashi?
Never out walking together, no.
- Maybe another young man?
- No, never.
He was in a polo shirt.
No. Why would I?
I'd never mistake you for another woman.
What do you think?
I didn't expect that it would come to this.
I don't know who to believe and why this all happened.
What on earth would I be doing out with Tadashi?
Your future brother in law it's not that unusual.
I don't mind you were with him.
But I want you to admit it.
I told you I didn't!
- Walking together is no problem.
- Right.
It's no profit for me to lie.
Because she wasn't your girlfriend.
What do you think Mr. Odori?
That is a circular dispute.
It's quite serious, so if it is true, she should admit it.
If your memory is vague, we must re-think.
As I said before,
I saw them more than once.
I remember what they were like.
The photos reinforce it.
If they were seen leaving a hotel, or something.
It would be natural for her to deny it.
But it wasn't. She can admit they were together.
Tadashi is Yoshie's betrothed, so Sayo's almost a sister in law.
No need for her to deny they were walking together.
I want to know why Sayo denies that they were.
That's what I don't understand, either.
Walking hand in hand would be a problem.
Or if they were cuddling.
But they weren't!
I don't care if they were walking together.
If the fishmonger's recollection of a short man is correct, then it's most probably true.
I've repeatedly asked that, and she's repeatedly denied it.
It wasn't me!
Then how did he see you?
I didn't come here to start telling lies.
He gains nothing by telling lies.
I can't understand why you believe him and not me.
- I believe him.
- Why?
And also, I believe...
Mr. Kakutaro, too.
Why don't you believe me?
I just don't get it.
Why don't you believe me?
I can't believe you.
None of these people stand to gain anything.
I'm just here to report what I saw.
How can you say what's not true?
Talking to me?
Yes! How dare you say
I was with Tadashi?
I've no reason to lie!
No one is here for their own profit.
If I lied, then I'd lose face.
Any sensible man, when questioned, would think carefully.
But you're so damn cocky and sure of yourself!
- Because I saw you!
- It wasn't me!
Look, I've got no reason to pick a fight with you.
Then why swear you saw me?
Because I did see you.
- It wasn't me.
- What the hell am I here for?
You're a witness.
This is nothing to me, but it's critical to me.
I'm not here to tell lies.
I've got a shop to run!
How can you say you saw us?
If it was me, fair enough.
But it's not true.
It would not be unusual...
You won't catch me telling stories!
Well, in this case you did.
She denies that it was her.
So why do you force her to admit that it was?
I'm not forcing anyone!
We must accept what he says.
Even if it is not the clearest of memories.
I was never out walking with a young man.
This is maybe not the best place to continue...
I've had quite enough!
Then let's stop here.
Well, everyone.
This film is designed to gather various objective opinions... surrounding the fact, that a man suddenly vanished.
I never expected this to happen.
Please don't get so upset.
We must get back on focus about Tadashi's disappearance.
I'd like you all to contribute your thoughts to that.
Please remember this is fiction.
None of it is fact.
In other words, you are movie-makers...
She's one woman!
I never felt like this before.
I'm honest to a fault.
If I hadn't said anything this would never had happened.
Because she had something with him, she denies it.
I can only say that life is always like that.
Why do you think Tadashi disappeared so suddenly?
I don't know.
Tadashi is my brother... but I didn't and I don't know why he disappeared.
What do you think of their stories?
About what they said?
After watching all this
I don't know what the truth is.
She's always looking for the black side of things.
People lied about me.
That's why I got mad.
They're saying he ran away from me.
I never did anything!
As I said just now, the reason why he vanished... is only known to himself.
- Do you believe in God?
- Yes, I do.
I surely do. I do whatever
God tells me to.
To be honest, I can't imagine what Tadashi was thinking.
Nobody but Tadashi knows why he vanished.
I don't think I believe in God.
But I respect God. It's a proper description how I feel about God.
Is this finished yet?
We should wind up.
It is easier to keep shop than to talk to you all.
I came here to help out.
Now I'm really disgusted!
I'm not staying here.
They are sisters. So as time goes by this will mend.
I feel empty.
Nothing's been gained.
I gradually realized that I suffered for nothing.
I can't believe anything.
Mr. Oka is leaving now.
Are you still suspicious of your sister?
Yes, I am.
You'll keep it up?
I'll probably end up believing her.
It's hard to distrust my sister.
I wish she weren't my sister.
Is that it?
Leaving already?
Yes, it's the end.
I guess this is the end.
Yes, it is.
The film is finished, but reality is not.
Nezumi, what will you do tomorrow?
I don't know.
THE END
The trumpet calls, the people shout,
"Strike out the band!"
The cymbals ring, for one and all
The martial swing.
Strike out the band!
Let's get on with the show, it's a hippy-hippy-ho
Come on, boys, let's go, let's go.
It's simply great
Come on people.
Come on, let's go
Hey, leader, strike out the band!
That drums resound, the trumpets call
The people shout,
"Strike out the band!"
The cymbals ring, calling one and all
The martial swing.
Strike out the band!
Let's get on with the show, it's a hippy-hippy-ho
Come on, boys, let's go, let's go.
It's simply great
Come on people.
Come on, let's go
Hey, leader, strike out the band!
And it keeps getting better.
Now, I'm gonna read a paper.
The next one is a Western camporee by Fred, Stan, Joe, and Steve.
But it takes them a little while to a car going or something.
So, this reminds me of a little joke.
I bet you people thought
I had no talent at all.
These two beetles are walking down the street... and they saw Father Mulligan.
And he had a broken arm.
They said,
"Father, how did you break your arm?"
He says, "I fell in the bathtub."
They said,
"Geez, that's too bad, Father."
So they continue to walk down the street.
So one beetle says to the other,
"What's a bathtub?"
And the one beetle says,
"To hell do I know, I'm not a catholic!"
Next... Russell. Come around.
Next... Let's go.
Quincy.
Harry... Harold, come here.
Over here... get your clothes on.
Was any actual... sexual relation between you and this female child?
Yes...
How old was the child?
- Only eleven.
- Eleven.
And how did you feel about that you commit such crime?
I didn't feel good about it.
Do you have any conscious experience... or any recollection about the time that did you have in your mind, when you involved to this crime?
Do you remember or have you been drunk or... been under drug or been intoxicated.
I was drinking.
You were drinking...
What did you drink?
Whiskey.
Did you need to shout at this girl on the street?
Yes...
This girl, is very underdeveloped girl... looks at least older than her age?
- Eleven years?
- No.
So, quite immature child?
A young girl?
Are you have these experiences, or these practices before, or this is just the first time?
I had before.
You did commit this crime before?
Or similar... you have been recalled for similar charges before?
No, I've never been caught before.
Never been caught, but you have been in practice... in this way that you abused a younger child?
Even my own daughter.
Even your own daughter?
And how you feel about that you do things like that?
How did your wife felt?
How did wife feel about it?
My wife... said that something was wrong.
Must have been.
Myself, I assume... the way I am right now, if I stay like this...
I'd sooner go to jail than stay here.
McCreary. Take your clothes off.
Okay there, let's go.
- Sommersault, Cullahan.
- Sommersault, come here.
Richard! Come here Richard.
Over here.
Take them off.
Come on.
Get your hands out.
Turn around... turn around!
Put your hands out again.
Okay...
Take your stuff and get over there!
Take your stuff and get over here!
Now get dressed-- here.
Do you know what in masturbation?
How often you masturbate a day or a week?
Sometimes three-- three times a day.
That's too much.
Why do you do this when you have a good wife, and she's attractive lady?
She must not have been...
She must not have been giving you too much sex satisfaction.
Are you tired about your wife?
Maybe you interested in other woman?
If I am interested in any woman...
I don't know...
You have ever get the conscience about to have a machoed woman...
A big tall... or husky, luscious looking female?
What you are interested in, big breast or small breast?
- In a woman?
- I never thought anything.
You have any homosexual experiences?
I guess you had.
What was it?
- You mean with someone else--
- With men... not that boy.
When I was young.
- What was it?
- I was young.
Just masturbating, stuff like--
You tried to masturbate other men, huh?
Other boys?
No, they used to do it to me.
In a public masturbation, common masturbation--
You engage in a common masturbation with other men-- other young men?
How long did you did this--
How long you have these practices?
I started when I was in Boy Scouts.
Went on a hiking trip.
We were camping.
It started in this... guy who used to live near the house. He was quite old.
You have not never had a guilt feeling when you masturbate?
It was going to kick my balls, I told him,
"Doctor... I'd much prefer", uh!
I told the doctor-- before coming here,
I didn't want, uh!
I didn't want my balls took out of me.
So they took the clothes off instead.
Right there!
You actually don't understand that you are a sick man?
If I know that there's something wrong,
Otherwise I wouldn't do things like that.
But if that's the way I am, right...
You have been in jail, you've been in house of correction, you've been in reformatory... you've been in "Lyman School," and...
You have been involved in criminal plans that says break and entering, assault and battery... driving without authority and so forth...
And additionally you have moral charges:
You-- your own daughter, and other young immature children, female children.
And you have been trying to hang yourself, you've been assaulting other people, you've been setting fires, and you've been... quite intolerant and apprehensive, and stressed and depressed.
Do you think you are normal man?
What do you think? And you still believe that you don't need help?
Sometime ago you told that you needed help.
No, I need help, but I don't know where I can get it.
You can get it here, I guess.
I-- I-- I--
Oh, I--
I-- I-- I--
I-- I couldn't belch the doctor.

Yes, it will.
It's going to be clean.
Okay, see ya later.
Bye bye now.
This was a good one.
Arnie? Come on, Arnie.
Hello Arnie. What's the matter?
What do you got in your mouth there?
I had something in my mouth.
Take it out of your mouth.
Drop it on the floor there.

How about giving us that watermelon plant?
Where can I work?
I'd like to know where can I work?

Well, whatever you feel like doing.
What do you feel like doing?
What can you do?
What can you do?
Okay? All right.
Go ahead... Bye.
Hey, Stan.
How come your room is so dirty, Jim?
- How come--
- The goddamn thing isn't dirty.
What? What'd you say?
What'd you say, Jim?
- I did not say anything.
- What?
- I did not say anything!
- I didn't hear you.
Speak up, man. I can't hear you.
What'd you say?
- Come on, Jim, let's go wash up.
- You can get changed.
- How's that room, Jim?
- Very fine.
- What?
- Very clean.
- Why put--
- What'd you say?
How's that room, Jim?
Answer me.
- Are you going to have that room clean, Jim?
- Yes, sir.
You could have had it all done last night, hm?
Is it cold?
Yesterday was the coldest, right?

- Hare cool!
What? What'd you say, Jim?
How's everything going to be tomorrow, Jim?
How's everything going to be tomorrow, Jim?
- Hey, how's your room going to be?
- Very neat, very clean.
How come it's not clean today?
You told me that yesterday.
What happened? Huh?
How come you didn't put all your clothes up?
- How's that room, Jim?
- Very clean, as clean as I can keep it.
What you say? Answer me, Jim!
- Okay, Jim.
- Thank you very much indeed.
Have a drink of water, Jim, before you go back.
All right.
How's the net been, right?
If it is on account of the house, Jim.
- There.
- Thank you.
- You can have some more if you want, Jim.
- Oh, I don't need any more.
- What'd you say, Jim?
- How's that room gonna be tomorrow?
Great, great.
Spick and span, right clean!

- Yes, sir!
What? What are you doing, Jim?
Good morning, Jim.
Good morning.

- Didn't I?
What'd you say?
I can't hear you, Jim.
- What are you hiding, Jim?
- All right, come on, let's go.
Everything's gonna be clean?
How's that room going to be?
How's that room going to be, Jim?
- Hold it.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
Very clean.
Keep that room clean, Jim.
How about keeping that clean, Jim?
- Do you play the piano, Jim?
- Yes.
What'd you say, Jim?
What do you play?
"In my home in Fitchburg."
Fitchburg?
Yeah. 84 Arlington Street.
- Were you a school teacher, Jim?
- Short while.
Junior high school.
Teacher of Arithmetic and Mathematics.
- Which college did you go to?
- Fitchburg State Teacher's College,
Fitchburg Normal School.
Fitchburg Business College,
Fitchburg High School.
Did you graduaste with honors, Jim?
So I took it home... I didn't think about it and I hung it in the closet.
So about a week, my wife opened the door of the closet of the stairs, the gas left out of the clothes-- you know?
It rises, eyes started watering, ya know. Oh geez!
That gas hangs around for months at a time, you know, gets in all the cracks.
It's a bastard.
The only thing that dissipates it is heat.
- Give it plenty of heat.
- So how'd they get rid of it?
That's how you get rid of it-- heat.
Downstairs, he was in that cage, you know-- downstairs.
We had a couple of big fans in there.
We had the heat blasting, we had those fans in there... steady for about a week.
All the time going, before we could get the gas out, ya know?
Incredible.
One time they gassed the guy down there,
I forget who the hell it was.
Eddie Mitchell. And he was in the bull-pen.
And they gassed him one day.
That was one of my days off, so when I came back,
I didn't know they had gassed him.
I went downstairs,
I said, "Jesus, that piss is really starting to smell!"
My eyes were watering.
They really were. I didn't know. I thought,
"Jesus, my eyes are watering!"
Couldn't figure it out, I go upstairs and start checking the books... and sure enough, they had gassed
Eddie Mitchell a couple of days before.
That gas, you know, it was right in the car.
I don't like them, it seems to affect the shit out of me fast.
I just get one whiff of it and...
I want to go to Chicago Town
That's where I long to be
Just you and me
I want to ride on the chute, the chute
And on the merry-go-round
Oh, what a joy to be only a boy in Chicago Town!
Thank you!
Willie! And me!
Get you out of this place.
You take a little bit some time and with medication--
But that's what I'm taking, I mean, now you give me the same story again.
"We are going to help you."
May I ask just why I need this help that you are literally forcing on me?
- I'm not forcing anything--
- Obviously, I talk well, I think well,
- I am well, and you are ruining me.
- May I say something?
We are not forcing you-- if you say
"I don't want to take--"
No, no, no!
I don't want to stay here, I am a prisoner.
If you say,
"I do not want to take the medication."
- We agree, you do not have to take it.
- But that's not the principle, Doctor.
The principle is that I am here, obviously well and healthy, and I am getting ruined.
If we send me back to the prison, where I might be able to get there on the street,
- as I should have.
- If I send you back to prison today, you might be able to get back in the same day to Bridgewater.
- No, no, Doctor, not unless--
- If you don't believe it, I let my--
Spit on my face, you know.
- Now why should I do that?
- Because if I say untrue, unreliable things, that I should be punished.
If we send you back to Walpole today, you're coming back tomorrow-- or maybe even tonight.
Honest to God.
- But doctor--
- You want to make it?
- You want to have a chance?
- Yes, yes, I certainly do.
But why are you so certain that I should be back tonight or tomorrow?
Because they look at you and they know that there is something wrong.
But Doctor, you are saying that I would be back here tonight or tomorrow.
Obviously I have been weakened since I have been here.
- I'll tell you something--
- Yes, I figure that I have been done harm here, since I've been here.
Now you tell me that if I should go back,
I will be back here-- now obviously you must know something
- that I do not know.
- I'll tell you something.
I have to leave you now but I have to tell you something.
It's just paranoia, which is, excuse me, which is nothing...
Nothing...
- which is nothing really dangerous.
- I know...
In some cases schizophrenia paranoia is dangerous, as the dictionary would say.
- But practically it's not dangerous.
- Schizophrenia paranoia is merely the love of your mother and father-- or unless you just happen to get somebody else's schizophrenia paranoia, which does happen, which is not amicable to the body.
In my case, it happens to to be the love of my mother and father.
If it's schizophrenia, and in that case it is not...
You mean that's why the man diagnosed schizophrenic paranoid, because he loved his mother and father?
Then I am a schizophrenic too, because I loved my mother and father...
But I have never been in a mental institution, nobody thought I should be!
Doctor, I am using your words. You looked at me and you tell me I'm a schizophrenic paranoia.
Just how do you know?
Because I speak well?
Because I stand up for what I think?
Because you got the
Psychological testings--
I did? Such as?
A test which asked me-- wait a minute doctor--
How many times do I go to the toilet?
Do I believe in God?
I mean, how ridiculous can you get?
I may never go to the toilet, or I may go to the toilet, or I may go to the toilet, or I may believe in God or I may not. It's not the business of a doctor.
In white clothes we actually see the God with the toilet!
No, this is the test! You see me?
What does that have to do with my sanity?
Obviously, you pick out this--
On your test--
No, no, wait!
Your test asked me when I go to the toilet!
How often I go to the toilet!
Even how often my friends go to the toilet!
The test asks,
"How often do your friends go to the toilet?"
Then it says: "Do you believe in God?
Do you love your mother? Do you love your father?"
It is really, I should say, not the business of any kind of doctor or physiologist--
Physicist.
No, physiologist.
Well, a physician might go for that too.
Now, you're keeping me here a year and a half, and I keep saying the same story...
Let's walk a little.
Now... after a year and a half of being harmed, you turn around and say if I should go back to prison--
- To the toilet?
- No-- No, to the prison.
To the prison. You say that I might be back tonight or tomorrow.
Obviously you must consider the surroundings has something to do with it...
What did they call the first big war?
How did the first big war start?
Because of a demand by the Austria-Hungary dynasty for the execution of an inmate who was already sentenced to a life imprisonment in Serbia.
Yet they demanded a prosecution, an execution by Austria-Hungary laws.
What does that mean?
They wanted an execution, and the war was fought over an execution.
The same execution that is going on in Vietnam over the American execution of these natives of Vietnam.
They are Viet Cong.
They are not Communists.
Anyone the American government doesn't like they use the voiced term of communist.
Because I speak the way I do you going to call me a communist? I am not a communist!
Even though I have communist affiliations.
Communist really means: community-ist.
That's what we are, community-ists, if you want to call us communists, because we are for a community.
We like the wealth standards, we are for people, and that's what they call people that talk about-- agitators.
We agitate. Do we start these troubles? I'm a communist because I expound my views about the world conditions?
It is the duty of every citizen to expound his views or her views of what goes on in the world.
If more expounded their views about the conditions in the world, less chaotic conditions would exist, and a nuclear war is in the offing.
Because... not what I say, not what all these warmongers or peacemongers blab about, because all through the ages, you will find every time a new weapon was put out.
They say these dreadnoughts is the end of war.
They said the submarine was the end of war-- what happened?
The gas masks put an end to war-- what happened?
They got gas masks.
What about these submarines that are supposed to control the seas?
What happened? They got airplanes that dropped depth charges.
You look through the ages, you'll find that for every new weapon put out, somebody puts out a counter-weapon.
But the nuclear weapon doesn't stop because people are stockpiling.
Anybody that starts stockpiling weapons... eventually uses them. They get tired of stockpiling, and then they're just like a bunch of little kids.
They figure they've got toys to play with, they're going to play with those toys!
But at the first chance you get, you wait til 1967 and the 1970s, you're gonna see the greatest nuclear war of all time.
1967, you're gonna see what happens.
- I can tell you how to get those situations--
- Wait a minute-- No, okay.
Those people-- the communists are going to offer them something, and they'll be fooled.
The Communists will give them nothing but regimented government.
- Strictly regimented government.
- So, why did the war in Southeast Asia start?
They are trying to plan people's futures, and they cannot do it because--
No, no! The original navigators that flew missions in Southeast Asia using the abbreviation called S-O-VIETNAM.
It means, to the navigator who doesn't see anybody,
SOVIETNAM-- name! 
- Soviet name and they hated the title--
- Like I'm saying, but those people like us, what they're going to accept, no matter who tries to fight it out of them.
- There are forces that are beyond--
- Nobody can stop them. that are beyond your mental abilities to realize, what do you call it, what happens.
You are not qualified to judge the planetary system, the universe system.
How about this?
The Communists are terrorizing those people.
Oh, the Communists...
They're just plain natives, that's all.
There are other factors, mitigating factors, that you don't understand, that do take place in Southeast Asia.
Give me an answer. Why is terrorization of those people supposed to be--
- Show me! Who? Who?
- Supposed to be able to take over their country and hold it in such a secure reign?
Look, there have been terrorism in
Southeast Asia for about 300 years.
- From the Communists, lately.
- Wait a minute, if you want to stop--
- And Buddhists.
- Oh, no it isn't.
You want to stop that war in Southeast Asia--
The Buddhists, by suicide, are trying to kick out the government of Ky because they think he is collaborating with the Communists.
It's their country! That's their natural prerogative. That's their natural right.
To try to kick out anybody that tries to influence their nation, influence their governments.
They have no proof!
They have no proof--
- What's the American government doing there?
- of collaboration with the communists-- suggest that--
- Let John talk.
- All right, no, no you tell them!
And the main factor about South Vietnam that people don't realize-- there are French influences.
There are still French, you could say, drawbacks from the French revolts.
They're still trying to monopolize the American military there.
You draw out the French from Southeast Asia, you have no war in Asia.
In fact, Ky and some of the others are, you could say, puppets of the French regime, and they're just trying to promote, fill in the gaps that the French weren't able to do.
And there isn't a nation in the world that can do more than what the French have started.
The Americans will reach the same rut that they are, because there's one great factor that influences the war in Southeast Asia.
America is the female part of the Earth World, and she's sex crazy.
Her sexiness brings on wars, like the sperm that is injected by a man into a woman, and by a woman into her own body.
It has the same effect, same influence, only this is in a gigantic pattern.
A gigantic pattern is vile. You mean to tell me after you've had sex intercourse you feel fine, or you feel healthy?
You don't.
... one hundred men will test today but only three win the Green Beret
Trained to live off nature's land, trained to combat, hand to hand
Men who mean just what they say, the brave men of the Green beret
Silver Wings upon their chest, these are men, America's best
One hundred men will test today, but only three win the Green beret
Back at home a young wife waits, her Green Beret has met his fate
He has died for those oppressed leaving her his last request
Mr. Malinoski. Come here a moment.
How you feeling?
- Huh? Good?
- Not too bad.
Not bad? All right.
Did you eat, Mr. Malinowski?
Did you eat your food?
No.
If you don't eat food, then we're going to feed you
With tube.
He knows.
I like you prepare for two patients, for tube feeding.
Two patients in F Hall.
They doesn't eat for three days.
Yeah, yeah. One is Malinowski and the other one is Chickory, Joseph Chickory.
That's right, tube feeding.
When you got ready?
A good, the official notice.
Mr. LaPol!
Mr. Malinowski, do you realize that you not eaten for long and we should give you some food?
Then this is the question whether you agree to drink this food or I will put through a tube through your nose, into your stomach.
You want to drink it? Or we'll get the tube and put it in your nose?
What are you drink it or not?
You want to drink it?
Let him sit down.
Maybe he drink it.
You want to drink it or you want to have it up through your nose?
You drink it or you'll dump it down the tube through your nose.
Get me a little drinking water.
Put the towel--
Give me the towel.
Here's some Vaseline, there ain't much of anything left.
- There any mineral oil?
- No.
It's hardly worth it.
We don't usually do this, ya know.
Is there any other grease or margarine oil or any oil or anything?
Any one of you gentleman write down on a little piece of paper what you will need an F for.
Mineral oil, jelly, ointment, what you need--
- Alcohol--
- We needed thorazine and dexedrine.
You couldn't get a supply for this kind of thing.
- Is there only grease? Butter?
- Butter? We've got plenty of butter.
Any butter.
This guy is a veteran.
He's been tube fed before.
Swallow... Just swallow. Swallow.
Swallow. That's a boy.
The mark is down there, what are you doing?
- Here?
- Yeah, right there.
Fetch some water, yeah?
Sam Durchill?
Mitch, did Sam Durchill work Friday?
No, he didn't work all last week.
He'll be in tomorrow.
Can you clamp here?
And a clamp-- for Emostat.
Have more, um, more food?
Leave some for the other guy, eh.
Chew it, chew your food.
You have not getting the jug.
One jug. A stainless steel jug.
We have some more?
Yeah.
Please, get this jug.
Save some for the other guy?
Here is a jug.
- A little whiskey?
- Thanks!
Watch when you pull.
Very good patient. Very nice.
Okay, here Doctor.
Release him, take it off.
Oh, hey that wasn't bad.
He's a veteran.
- I think he's been tube fed before.
- I guess so-- Gotcha.
- Okay, you had your dinner.
- He is an experienced kid at that.
- Hold my hand.
- Watch the tube, will you!
Congratulations, and a Happy Birthday!
There's going to be a big blow.
I can see it coming!
Have you ever been lonely?
Have you ever been blue?
Have you ever loved someone, just as I love you?
Can't you see that I'm sorry, for each mistake I've made?
Can't you see that I've changed, dear?
Can't you see that I've paid?
Be a little more giving, take me back in your heart
How can I go on living, now that we're apart?
If you knew what I've been through, then you'll know why I ask you
Have you ever been lonely?
Have you ever been blue?
Have you ever been lonely?
Have you ever been blue?
All right, here's one sliver of cake.
Oh, that one got away.
- Do you think you're able to stand tall now?
- Oh, sure.
- Well, good!
- I'm on medication.
They just found the medication, ya know,
January, last January.
What does the medication do for you?
It relaxes my muscles.
When I get nervous, my muscles get tense, and I feel like--
- Now you just want to feel like-- go to sleep.
- Yeah, I feel relaxed.
Not sleepy but-- I don't get angry...
Nothing bothers me.
I was at the bar, at the bar, where I smoked my first cigar
And the nickels, nickels, nickels rolled away
It was there by chance, that I stole a pair of pants
And now I am serving 30 days
- You know that fella who's master of ceremonies?
- Yeah.
- They tell me he's the worst paranoid.
- Is that so?
- Who, Willy Williams?
- Willy Williams.
You'd think he was just so relaxed, and you'd think he'd been doing it for years.
Yeah, and he's a paranoid!
They can't reach him.
You reach him, Allison.
It is a letter from an inmate of mine.
They sent me this letter.
I wish you could read it, really.
An inmate from the other side, an alcoholic.
Look at the nice letter he wrote me.
- Well yeah, Wilhelm.
- Well, isn't that nice!
- And he sent this medal to me.
- He sent that?
He sent that. Isn't that nice?
I hope we cured him, but it really is a lovely letter.
- It is. It really is.
- It makes you feel good?
Well, it makes you feel good that you're doing a little something from even at the time you don't think you're helping them because they have such a problem.
But when you get a letter like this, it makes you feel as if-- well, you at least tried.
Come on boys, all of you fellas standing back there.
Come on up here and show us what your aim is.
Oh, come on! 
What's so bashful?
All right, move over fellas. We've got a fella who's going to aim right in the middle.
That's it! Right up to it.
And stick it right-- all right put it on.
Good, oh! I think you got licked young man.
I think you got licked that time.
Yes, you got licked that time.
All right, come on, somebody else be here.
I'm off! I'm off, I'm gone.
We have to know your numbers.
Here we are, that's it.
Now, here's the fella who's going to put it right on the bulls eye!
Now line it right up with this.
This is where you're coming, bang-o!
When you hear my voice, you'll know you're here.
Come on... Shut your eyes. Come right at it!
Straight ahead, you're coming right for it!
Come on a little further, a little further.
That's the way.
Now right on that bulls eye.
Oh, that's perfect. Very good.
You're inside the ring at least.
Now hold the number.
Now who else? Come on, now who else?
Come on over and try it! Well, is that everybody?
Has everybody tried it?
You know this is the first time we've played this game, and I want you all to try it.
I want to go to Chicago Town, that's where I long to be
Just you and me
I want to ride on the chute, the chute, and on the merry-go-round
Oh, what a joy to be only a boy in Chicago Town!
It's do or die for MCI and that is our gay philosophy
And we'll lose our jobs--
Wait a second.
Yes?
Mary, do I have anything listed for court tomorrow or anything else?
- No, you don't.
- Thank you.
I have nothing for court tomorrow, tomorrow's fine.
Oh good God, no!
I'm usually here unless I'm dead by then, and I've got a cold and I may be.
I usually get here by 8:15 or 8 o'clock.
So, at your convenience.
Okay, well the earlier the better.
Okay, why don't you do me a favor, give me a call.
What time do you get up in the morning?
Why don't you give me a call as soon as you roll out of bed at home, just to make sure I'm alive enough to get down here.
Oh God, no.
Well, let's put it this way:
If I'm sick, with four children in the house,
I'll be awake.
And usually I get up at 5:30, otherwise.
Don't make it much later than that because I'm out the door to get down here.
Okay. Bye bye.
Vladimir, as I promised you before, if I see enough improvement in you--
But how can I improve when I'm getting worse.
I've been trying to tell you, day by day I am getting worse.
Because of the circumstances, because of the situation.
Now you tell me-- until you see improvement-- each time I get worse!
So obviously it's the treatment that I'm getting or the situation, or the place... or the patients, or the inmates.
I do not know which. I just want to go back to the prison where I belong.
I was supposed to only come down here for observation.
What observation did I get?
You call me up a couple of times, and you say,
"Well, take some medication, medication for the mind."
I'm supposed to take medication if I have some bodily injury, not for the mind. My mind's fit.
I'm obviously logical,
I know what I'm talking about and I am excited, yes, that's the only fault you might find with me.
And I have a perfect right to be excited,
I have been here for a year and a half.
And this place is doing me harm.
Every time I come in here, you tell me I look crazy.
Now, if you don't like my face that's another story, but that has nothing to do with my mental stability.
I have an emotional problem now, yes, which I did not have.
- What got you down here?
- They sent me for observation.
Why?
They thought-- I went to see a social worker and I saw a psychiatrist and they said,
"Why don't you go down there?"
I had a little problem.
You thought your coffee was poisoned, you thought people were mixing you up in your thinking...
The only part that's true is coffee, and what sort of treatment do I get down here?
There are a hundred patients who are walking back and forth, who are obviously doing me harm.
- Are you working here, Vladimir?
- No, there was no suitable work for me here.
All I've got is the kitchen, all I do is pull cups on...
In fact, it's noisy. They've got two television sets which are blaring-- Machines which are going.
Everything which is against the mind.
There is one thing that a patient does need-- and this is what I do know, absolutely-- is quiet, if I have a mental problem, or even an emotional problem.
Yet, I am thrown in with over a hundred of them, and all they do is yell, walk around, televisions are blaring...
So that's doing my mind harm.
- Are you involved in any sports here?
- There are no sports here!
All they've got is a baseball and a glove, and that's it.
There's nothing else. Back at the other place
I have all the facilities to improve myself,
I have the gym, I have the school,
I have all kinds of-- Anything I want.
- Are you in any group therapy here?
- No, there was no group therapy--
Obviously, I do not need group therapy,
I need peace and quiet!
See what I mean?
This place is disturbing me. It's harming me.
I am losing weight, everything that's happening to me is bad, and all I hear is, "Well, why don't you wait?
Why don't you take your medication?"
The medication is disagreeable to me.
There are people to whom you may not give medication.
Obviously, the medication I got is hurting me. It's harming me.
In fact, to be specific, it harmed my thorax.
I do know that much-- what it's harming.
- Your Thorax?
- Yes. It's harmed me. It's harmed me in every way possible.
Obviously, if you leave me here, that means you want me to get harmed.
Which is an absolute fact. It's plain logic.
That proves that I am sane.
- Well, that is an interesting logic.
- Yes, it is absolutely perfect.
Because if I am at a place, as if I were in some kind of a hole or something, and if you keep me there, obviously you intend to do me harm. Isn't that perfect logic?
- No, it isn't, Vladimir.
- It's absolute perfect.
I am getting harmed!
I say I'm getting harmed!
You tell me, that "Until I show some improvement..."
Each time you said "Until I show some improvement,"
I have been getting worse.
Medication has harmed me!
- Thank you, Vladimir.
- No, no, I--
Now you can go.
He's been much better than this, and he's now falling apart.
Now whether this is some reaction to his medication, it's certainly something we'll have to look at.
However, he was looking a lot more catatonic and depressed before, and sometimes we find with the antidepressants you remove the depression and you uncover the paranoid stuff, and we may have to give him larger quantities of tranquilizer-- just to tone this down.
Instead of not looking ready to be able to make it back to prison...
It is a perfect paranoid pattern, if you accept his basic premise, then the rest of it is logical-- but the basic premise is not true.
Of course.
He was very much more closed off and mute before.
He'd open up in a one-to-one relationship, but never at a staff meeting.
And he's opened up over at medical rounds some.
And yet, this is why we had him brought up to staff to see what would happen.
And I think he's certainly shown that he doesn't--
At one time they sought executive clemency for him.
And it is true that he did learn English-- while he was building up a great deal of hope... to get out. And he did get to the parole board at one time, and he was...
He's now talking about the same things about his rehabilitation from his incarceration up to a given point.
So he's reverting in a way to that kind of thinking.
Another thing, he's terrified of leaving.
And the louder he shouts about going back the more frightened he indicates he probably is.
- This is known as Ganzer syndrome.
- Well, not quite.
- Close.
- Well, I think what we have to do with him is put him on a higher dose of tranquilizers, and see if we can bring the paranoid elements under a little better control, and see if we can get him back on medication.
If he's taking it now and I'm not even sure he is.
The psychological testing always showed there was a paranoid who was the thing that was going through it all the way.
Right.
Diagnosis: schizophrenic reaction, chronic undifferentiated type.
With prominent paranoid features.
Okay, Al. Is that good, eh?
Take some of that chocolate pudding off.
How's that feel?
Al, Why don't you lay right down in the water so you can get your back washed?
Yeah, soak your piles.
- How does that feel?
- Lay right down there.
Don't drown, Al.
- Sit down, Al. That a boy. Backwards.
- Go backwards, Al.
Albert.
Sit down and face me.
No, face me.
How does that feel?
Don't swallow that water.
- Watch your head.
- There, right there.
- Watch your head by those pipes.
- How does it feel?
- Real good.
- Wonderful?
Water is so special.
Special like champagne, right?
- Like champagne?
- There you go.
Why don't you drink a little cold water, Al?
Yeah, Al. Don't be drinking that.
Don't be drinking that water.
Al, get some water here if you want.
We put a faucet here.
- Feels good?
- I want to go to the house.
- You feel nice and clean?
- Push right back, Al.
- Do you have four brothers?
- I have to kiss the mirror in his honor.
Wonderful. A nice kiss.
- Okay, Al? All set?
- Okay, let's go.
Peace be to this house and all who dwell herein.
Sprinkle me with the swab, oh God, and I shall be purified.
Wash me and I shall remain whiter than snow.
May the lord forgive you by this holy annointing and by his most loving mercy, whatever sins you have committed by the use of your sight, amen.
May the lord forgive you by this holy annointing and by his most loving mercy, whatever sins you have committed by the use your hearing, amen.
May the lord forgive you by this holy annointing and by his most loving mercy, whatever sins you have committed by the use your sense of smell, amen.
May the lord forgive you by this holy annointing and by his most loving mercy, whatever sins you have committed by the use of your sense of taste and power of speech, amen.
Now let me have your two hands, please.
May the lord forgive you by this holy annointing and by his most loving mercy, whatever sins you have committed by the use of your sense of touch, amen.
May the lord forgive you by this holy annointing and by his most loving mercy, whatever sins you have committed by the use of your power to walk, amen.
May the Lord be with you, and with your spirit, amen.
Let us pray. Lord, Holy Father, almighty and eternal God, by pouring the grace of your blessing on the bodies of the sick.
You watch over, with all embracing care, your creatures.
Be present in your kindness as we call upon your holy name.
What is indulgences?
Indulgences is where--
Even a blessed person, Father Mulligan, with his confessional there, telling the truth, and exposing and calls it down to the warden Johnson and things like that, and they get around to it.
Father, even the rabbi, and not only Rabbi but the Christian Scientist, and the minister--
We know all about them,
I know everything, because I am psychic,
I read their fucking minds, and they're no good, they're money-changers,
Judases, and that's all.
Though I'll tell you one thing, even Pope Paul is not without sin, cause even him, and the cardinals, and the sea of Trent, helped to crucify the man named Pope Pius, and the hiccups, and the minister of truth, who was their fucking doctor.
And Pope John could tell you the same thing-- it was never decreed that way.
The vicar of the church is Jesus Christ, and the blessed Virgin Mary, and I say, he's unworthy of being the Pope of this world.
And I announce that the rightful Pope now is Archbishop Fulton Sheen, and the other one, Cardinal Spellman.
So help me God. I, Borges, say so.
For the glory of the glory of Father Mulligan
For the glory of his love and his holiness
For the glory of the glory of thy love
For the glory of the glory of the bishop
For the glory of the glory of the Cardinal
For the glory of the pastor and the rabbi
For the glory of the glory of his love
She promised me she was gonna send me cake or something.
She's a liar!
A liar, defector of the truth.
And so is Peabody. I say so.
I, Borges, say so.
For the glory of the glory of Father Mulligan...
- Can I get a cappuccino?
- No problem.
It's getting colder outside.
I'm sorry, Jim.
- Don't be afraid.
- You're going too far over.
Joe, let me get up in the front.
That's right, take your time.
Now just stand right where you are.
I am the resurrection and the life.
He who believes in me, even if he dies shall live.
And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die.
Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has visited and wrought the redemption of his people.
He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the House of David, his servant, as he promised through the mouths of his holy ones, the prophets from of old.
Eternal rest granted on him, O Lord, and let the perpetual light shine upon him.
- May he rest in peace.
- Amen.
May his soul and the souls of all the faith departed
- to the mercy of God, rest in peace.
- Amen.
Remember, man, that though art dust, and unto dust thou shalt return.
That is all.
Hundreds of turtles die every day in this hot desert of sand.
The barrets nest inside the big skeletons.
The little ones look for some meat among the bones.
The natives of the Malay islands bury their dead in this immense underwater cemetery.
Their religion teaches that the sea washes the bodies and frees them from sin.
Only during the day are these waters empty and still.
At night, the sharks rush in to perpetrate their devastating action.
They only leave the bones, which the friends and families of the dead arrange, with macabre pity, among the bizarre coral branches. ln these waters, the sharks of the Malay coast learned how to feed on human flesh and become man eaters.
Catching man eaters is the only resource in Raiputh, a village on the Malay coast.
Fishermen who were disabled by the sharks' bites pile up in the sun dried fins on the beach.
They will sell them to rich Chinese communities, where they are thought to have a strong aphrodisiac power.
Every day in Raiputh, a fisherman doesn't come back, or returns in this condition.
But the village is poor and the
Chinese pay well for their vice.
So the sacrifice goes on.
The only alternative to despair and pain is revenge.
Today there has been another victim. ln these waters, a 1 2-year-old boy has been devoured by a shark.
Today the fishermen of Raiputh give up their prey.
They give it back to the sea with a poisoned sea-urchin stuck in its throat. lt will suffer at least for one week before it will die. ln the Roman cemetery of the Capuchins, death has been assigned a decorative task.
A few centuries ago, maybe the monks wanted to give this place a sense of immortality. ln spite of its gruesome results, this work shows a certain sense of beauty, which is always motivated by love.
Love that survives death, death that survives love.
MARlO AND lNES
Still in Rome, on the Tiberina island, the ''Red Sacks'' brotherhood keeps carrying out its mission.
The ''Red Sacks'' brotherhood started around the 1600's upon the initiative of some Romans who, during the plague, wanted to bury the abandoned bodies of the poor and the unknown.
Nowadays, after so many centuries, the ''Red Sacks'' still look after their mortal remains, the sole but eloquent evidence of the old compassion.
Protecting the bones from the ravages of the time is the task of some local families who gather here once a week on Fridays to work and to pray.
Just like these Germans from Hamburg, let's drown the memory of so many cemeteries in the beer. lnstead of focusing on the cult of death, in this happy German beer-house on Repabahm Strasse, our attention goes now to the cult of life.
Life as happiness for being alive, freedom of spirit, agility, physical health, sociability, peacefulness, oblivion.
But most of all, complete absence of any memory or thought of death.
Who said, ''Drink beer and you'll live to be 100''?
But the Japanese in Tokyo, after a very busy night, come straight in here to get back in shape.
This is a Tokyo Onsen, a real service station to wash and lube those Japanese who got drunk on the previous night.
The perfect functioning of the company depends on some hundred girls in shorts and bras, so that the patrons, besides so many tortures, can at least comfortably enjoy the landscape.
According to a gentle
Japanese custom, the patrons must be naked.
We covered him according to a gentle custom of ours.
Japan is maybe the cleanest country in the world.
The rituals of bathing and massage are as old as its civilization. ln Tokyo, a city with
10 million people,
6 million women tend every day to 4 million men, pampering, flattering, serving and rubbing them, in order to make their lives more pleasant, according to an old, admirable tradition.
So, Japanese men, with every inch of their bodies taken care of, without the smallest personal effort, can taste the heavenly relaxation that their god will only grant them in the afterlife.
Chinese men too, give themselves up to the hands of a woman on the day of their last makeup.
They entrust to her seductive arts their uncertain fate to come.
Buddha is a wayward god, very impressionable, and when he opens the gates of the flowering garden, he cares more for the looks than for the virtues of the dead.
This is the funeral of a rich Chinese in a temple of the city of Macao.
Friends are bringing food to his altar, so he can nourish himself during his long trip.
Then they bow before the mourning family. ln a corner, a woman burns his money, which, only this way, will be able to follow him and preserve for him, in heaven, what to every
Chinese is the utmost good of this life and the other: wealth.
The heirs attend in tears the sad ceremony.
Not only here in Singapore, but in all Malaysia, the Chinese represent over a third of the population.
Never tired to figure out a thousand ways of making money, they are nonetheless famous for their physical laziness.
They don't swim, run, jump, or play soccer.
As the Chinese don't waste their money, likewise, they don't waste their energies, which they prefer to use around the table or in bed.
Between snacks, the Chinese find the time to fill their houses with children, legitimate and illegitimate.
This guarantees a big bunch of birthdays to celebrate with abundant meals.
The Chinese celebrate everything by eating:
Religious and national holidays, business, a competitor's failure, an averted danger, births, and even death.
Here we're not allowed to photograph.
We had to force the situation to show you
Singapore's ''home of the dead''.
All the terminally ill end up dwelling here, in this tragic hotel for the dying.
The Chinese homes, full with children, have no place for them.
Down the streets, their relatives, relaxed and confident, wait for their funeral. lf you don't die soon, sing the Chinese, your good dinner gets cold. lf they see us eating, say the Chinese, they'll get hungry too.
Death is still late and the Chinese urge the gods with a dance.
To the cars, the house of the dead is America.
California kills three of them every 2 hours.
They get dumped in these cemeteries, but their remains will not be eternal.
Compressed to save space, thousands of Fords, Chevrolets,
Chryslers, Oldsmobiles,
Cadillacs, Lincolns, Buicks, no longer need any repair.
But they're not yet at the end of their destiny.
Soon they will be shipped to the great European car factories, where the modern mechanical reincarnation will bring them back to life as cars, with a new, more humble label: ''economy vehicle''.
Correction: not all of them will come back as cars. ln Paris, in one of the most respectable modern art stores, we recognized the remains of an old Ford, whose name was changed into a charming
''Esprit de la Carrosserie'',
''Spirit of Chassis''.
The price: half a million francs.
The Czech painter
Yves Klein is ready.
Music gave him the thrill.
These models, covering themselves with paint, are the human brushes that soon Klein will use to turn his creative fever into art.
You may have guessed, by now, that Klein's favorite color is blue.
Moreover, blue is his only form, his only color.
Blue like his pictures that sell like hot cakes in Paris.
Blue like the event that our camera is approaching, which most venerable critics consider as the utmost
Klein masterpiece, whose dominant color, as any connoisseur may guess, happens to be blue.
Dripping with blue, the human brushes leave their prints on the canvas, while Klein guides them from afar, with the energy of his creative genius.
The work, that we had the privilege to catch in all the phases of its creation, is on sale for only
4 million francs. ln search of tropical, impressive views, and the picturesque aspects of primitive life, three thousand American tourists arrive in Honolulu.

Organization'' that, for only $4,000, taxes included, organized for them 10 days of a ''very exciting holiday,'' as it is advertised in the brochure, a vacation across a ''tropical dance and paradise of love.''
The paradise of love and dance.
The first page of the Hawaiian Travels' long and detailed program says that the landing ceremony will take place in a charming
Hawaiian atmosphere and according to the romantic customs of this love island.
Therefore the company's management invites the gentle ladies not to be jealous of the innocent attention that the splendid
Hawaiian girls will direct to their husbands.
Soon after, the company's photographer, provides the tourists with their arrival souvenirs, which includes, according to the program, smiles and flowers leis that the splendid
Hawaiian girls lay on their guests with amazing generosity.
The speaker is now informing the tourist about the main customs of this tropical paradise.
He says:
''Ladies and gentlemen,
fate has been generous with you
by giving you the privilege
to visit this island
before it was too late.
The beautiful women
who are giving you
this charming performance
are the last specimen
of a race
that is disappearing.
lt's a pity you can't savor
a bit of their
very sweet language. ''
They sing:
''Welcome, welcome,
strong and handsome white man.
Welcome, welcome, seductive
and beautiful white woman.
You will teach me the secret
of your elegance wherefore
you can seduce your men.
l will teach you the secret
of my dance wherefore
l seduce mine.
Come, come to learn the Hula.
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is the Hula.
You think it's too difficult?
Of course,
ladies and gentlemen,
but nothing is impossible
as Abraham Lincoln used to say.
Look at that dancer.
She's the best in the island.
But, ladies and gentlemen,
when she was a child,
she was struck by polio
and do you know what
had the power to free
her poor crippled limbs?
The Hula,
ladies and gentlemen.
The Hula and her willpower. ''
They listened, clapped, had fun and got moved, exactly as it was written in the program.
And now that the program prescribes a Hula lesson, they go to learn Hula, nice and diligent.
This candid generation of once hard workers now believe in the Hula, in theirs and other people's happiness, while they enjoy a little murdering rest, with their first symptoms of arthritis.
They still believe in this tropical paradise that they have destroyed and where the only real, genuine native dance we can still attend, is this one.
After six hours of cold steel training,
Sergeant Rhuba Narcktitle is being made up as a woman.
The situation is pretty embarrassing, for a fierce warrior who, only a few years ago, during the war against the Malaysian communists, decapitated 36 partisans.
But today is a national holiday and the tradition wants him to celebrate it with a dance in a woman's costume.
The fierce Gurkhas live in the mountains of Nepal.
For one and half century, they have been mercenaries under the English empire.
According to the tradition, their celebration must be attended by all English officers, their commander-in-chief included.
Seeing them in this circumstance and dressed like women, nobody would believe they are the fiercest and most faithful soldiers in the world.
Still, during the last war, when they were captured by the Japanese, 300 of them preferred to be decapitated rather than betray their promise of loyalty to her British Majesty.
Today is the anniversary of that memorable day and the Gurkhas celebrate it with great solemnity.
This time too, the bull's head has fallen with one strike.
The honor of the battalion is saved.
The spirit of the fallen
Singapore soldiers is at peace.
The English officers watch with satisfaction.
The English colonel encircles the heads of the champions with a white strap, a symbol of strength, fidelity and bravery.
About a month later, in Portugal, a few bulls take their revenge goring and killing 4 people, and injuring 18.
We are at Vila Franca de Xira, where the people happily celebrate the traditional ''Forcada''.
Later on, in the arena, the nobles too give a proof of their courage.
On these mountains of the Garoka region in New Guinea, lies the border between history and prehistory.
Here we found the last cave man, still armed with a club.
He doesn't even know metal, he lives in the unreachable caves of the mountain with his women and children, he's as wild and suspicious as a beast.
We don't know how he'd react if he spotted our camera pointed at him.
Rather than by a camera, these images seem to be caught by a huge telescope pointed into time.
They could be the shadow, the photographic memory of the stone age.
This day, this moment, goes back 4 or 5 thousand years.
Nothing particular is happening.
Now as in the past, life goes on under the eternal guide of their instinct for work, leisure, children, food, human contact and an orderly social life.
50 miles north of there, a Catholic mission marks the extreme outpost of civilization.
Five missionaries have been killed in recent years before the sound of a bell could awake, through these old valleys, the instinct of faith.
Here, after hundreds of centuries spent in the dark, men discover, for the first time, that there's a doubt, a question they cannot answer, sense of anguish, unknown so far, which is not hunger or thirst or physical pain, but that hurts, nonetheless, like a wound. lt's the anguish that follows men from the beginning to the end of world.
But they still don't know it.
Only yesterday they discovered the world and themselves and today they need to believe, to hope that they'll be better in a better world.
But one fine day, the aboriginal comes down from the mountains and, as he approaches the coast, his experience runs across hundred of centuries in a few days.
Here, at the gates of
Port Moresby airport, where the aboriginal ends his journey through the time and where he cannot find a reason to all the things he learned, but saw too quickly, the ''Cargo Cult'' has burgeoned inside of him, that is, the cult of these cargo airplanes.
Along the great oceanic course between
Hong Kong and Australia, flown every day by tens of cargo airplanes that stop here in Moresby, the Cargo Cult has a temple almost everywhere.
Here is one, with the altar built at an altitude of 3,000 meters.
The small airplane is at one end of the track.
On the other end, the control tower.
The native of the Rozo and Mekeo tribes wait for some airplane, attracted by their bamboo decoy, to land on this track.
To them, airplanes come from heaven, sent by their ancestors, but the white men, those cunning thieves, take charge of them and lure them in the big Port Moresby trap.
Build your airport too, says the Cargo Cult doctrine, and wait with faith.
Sooner or later your ancestors will find out the treachery and will lead the airplanes to your track.
Then you'll be rich and happy.
They wait motionless, scanning the sky.
There is no other world beyond these mountains, so the big birds that fly up there can only come from heaven. ln heaven, there are only their dead and only their dead could build them.
The spirits of the dead do not know the whites, so all those wonderful things carried by the airplanes are sent to them by their dead ancestors.
They destroyed their villages, they abandoned their jobs, but here they are, still waiting with faith at the gates of heaven.
Chronicle Of A Summer a MAI HARRIS TITLE Version
This film, made without actors, was lived by men and women....
...who devoted some of their time to an experiment...
...in filming the truth.
A round table discussion is an excellent idea...
But I wonder if it's feasible... to record a conversation naturally with a camera present.
For example, will Marceline relax and talk normally?
She can try.
It won't be easy.
I'm bound to feel nervous.
Nervous of what?
Nervous in case...
I may not be able to cope.
You're not nervous now?
Not yet.
Then you'll be all right.
Morin and I only want you to...
...to answer some questions.
Anything you object to can always be cut.
All right?
As long as you go easy...
He's the bully!
Get cracking, Morin.
Right! Here goes.
You've no idea of the questions...
Nor have we for that matter.
What we have in mind... is a film on how people live.
You're our starting point: how do you live?
In other words, what do you do with your life?
We begin with you, because you're at the centre of our experiment.
What do you do all day?
Work, mostly.
I'm with a market research firm.
I interview people...
Analyse and report on the interviews.
The job keeps me busy...
Like it?
When you leave home in the morning...
Have you a plan for the day?
I know what I ought to do.
But I don't always do it.
I never know what I'll do next day.
I Live on the principle that tomorrow can take care of itself
For me, adventure is always just around the corner.
If we sent you out to ask people...
If they were happy-would you do it?
Excuse me, are you happy?
He said, buzz off.
It's all right, we won't bite.
It depends what you mean. I'm happily married...
Can't you tell from my face?
You seem very bright.
Yes, I'm happy to be alive... even if I am 60...
And I've a long journey to work every day...
I've my health and a kind husband.
It all depends...
Depends  what money you have.
Life's no fun for the workers.
I've my share of troubles.
But you're not unhappy?
My sister's dead...
At 44...I'm pretty browned off, you can take it from me.
I don't even try to understand any more.
Are you unhappy?
Question of philosophy...
We're conducting an enquiry into happiness.
And you've no name to quote?
What about Descartes, for instance ?
I'm just reading this...
We're conducting an enquiry...
Can't you talk?
Try me out of uniform!
I've been happy, I've been sad.
I've had a bit of everything...
You can't have life all your own way.
I'm unhappy because I'm old.
I'm 79...
Born in'82.
Are old people always unhappy?
I've lost my wife.
I'm all on my own, there's the rent for my room to pay each month.
Are you happy too?
We're young, it's fine...
Daniel told me you were willing to be interviewed.
I've only one question to ask.
Do your living conditions satisfy you?
We don't go short of anything...All we want is to get on in the world.
We mustn't grumble, I suppose.
Frankly, we can't grumble. We don't.
But...
To get anywhere, you must work.
That's not the point. We still have to fiddle a bit to make out.
It's true...I'm just answering you.
No one could manage if they stuck to the letter of the law.
If I invoiced all my customers...
If I didn’t fiddle the books, we couldn’t go on.
Sometimes I'm happy... depends...
Paris isn't much fun, let's face it.
Fumes, no sun...
They work all week; Sunday they spend in fear of damaging the car.
They set up table and chairs by the roadside...
An unmade lane might damage the car.
It'll take them hours driving home.
Call that sane?
Do you live differently?
I try to..we try to...
Doing things just for the fun of it.
What kind of things?
Well, my friends and I muck about on things that'll never be useful
And generally waste our time...
What's your name?
Henri, I hear you're happy?
I don't know... I don't consider happiness an aim.
I try to live... a normal life...
To be honest with myself...
The fact we're 2 now alters nothing.
We just try to work it out together.
What about you?
I lived at home till I was 17.
Then I went into business with friends
To make money quickly...naturally!
Hard work is really a waste of time... especially just to earn money.
We got hold of Louis Philippe chests
Took them to pieces...
And made them up as Louis XVI antiques
People were taken in by the old wood.
It's not easy to tell the real age...
Sometimes we added pillars either side
And we reduced the drawers to three.
Later we even faked Louis XIV pieces.
We added curves and fresh veneer.
Did the job pay?
It paid all right ...but I left,
Now they're suing me...That's typical of the business world.
It's ghastly! I made nothing out of it, but I learned my lesson.
It's a dead loss.
I'm a painter... I've no theories...
Painting's the way I learn. I love it...
And it helps me understand other artists.
What do you do every day?
We've been together for a year and a half now...
It's been like a honeymoon...
We stayed in bed most mornings... reading...
In the afternoons we painted...
At least we have the last six months.
We always wanted to travel and last
May we went... It was our honeymoon.
We were away till September...
We rented a studio in an old house... in the Camargue.
We were flat broke and we had to pay our way somehow.
Our great discovery was that life's the same there as here...
I painted names on boats...anything...
We lived well on 2 hours work a day.
We lay about in the sun, did some painting...
I don't worry about happiness...
It's an empty word anyway.
Happiness, unhappiness, it's all one.
They shouldn't be in the dictionary.
Grief is another matter...
We haven't much money, but even friends, who are well off, don't have...
...the books and records we do.
When we sell a painting...
We buy something to make life richer...
When I think that every morning you get up at the same time...
You have breakfast...take the same old road to the station...
You arrive at the station...
Go up the steps, get in the train...
You go in by the same gate every day...
Clock in...
Sit at your desk and draw...
It's the same at lunch...
You talk, eat, go back to work, and in the evening...
You take the train, go home, eat, go to bed...
It's always the same and quite fatuous.
When I reach the factory gates in the morning, I feel certain...
I'll rebel. Then I think to myself, what the hell!
I've never heard anyone say his job interests him.
You feel the same way, Angelo?
Just about.
Lots of fellows want to get on, go up a step...
Workers want to be technicians...
Technicians want to be...
I don't know... engineers, perhaps.
So they go to classes...
That's the hope...But what do they leave for? To go job-hunting.
Lots leave and find themselves job-hunting so they come back.
Some start their own businesses...and succeed. Those who don't come back.
Office workers face the same problem.
It's the same wherever you work...
Whatever the firm. In the factory...
It's the same. The job is so split up, so organised...
With a monotonous job...And you get browned off with it, always the same.
I think...I work 24 hours a day...
True, we only do a 9 hour shift...
But the remainder of the time...
You use to sleep, so you can work.
So it comes to the same thing- work all the time.
You wanted to meet Landry, and here he is.
Why are you here?
I'm a student at Villeneuve.
It's a pleasant spot.
I work at Renault's.
That's a household word in Africa.
It's the only make of car we know!
But I couldn't work in a factory.
You're shut in....
Surrounded by noise all day.
You're right, it's frightful!
I don't know how we stick it.
The rules, the bad feeling among the men...
The bullying by foremen and management.
That's what's so awful.
You couldn't face it, you say...
But sometimes it's that or nothing.
When you came to France...
And everything, everybody was new...
That's what I'd like to hear about.
I knew absolutely nobody... no one...
I'd no idea how the French lived...
But I managed to get by...somehow.
For a man like me... it's not easy.
An African in France is...must adapt.
Another thing...Events sometimes...
People do get inferiority complexes...
That certainly goes for me...
That's what I wanted to ask you...
Do you still suffer from it?
Not any more. I soon realised that...
France isn't like French Africa.
No Colour bar?
Not quite, but I've a system to beat it.
When the door shuts, I turn and go.
That's the spirit!
What do you think of the workers?
In France? I don't know what to think.
I really don't. Every little workman...
...owns his car, has a good time.
Maybe it's not like in Africa...
At Renault 80% of the chaps have cars.
The French worker's an individualist.
He only works for himself.
He wants his salary so he plugs away...
He scrimps and saves...
To keep up with the Joneses.
But he's a poor type...honestly!
I'm always broke but I like my food.
Some of the fellows at Renaults...
...live on bread and cheese.
But as you say, they've a car.
Naturally, you say the French worker...
...never had it so good.
He can't afford a car, a home...
But don't believe it.
I live with them, I know.
Meet a worker in a restaurant...
And he'll be all dolled up...
But for all that, he's poor.
He scrimped and saved for that suit.
It's all an act...a joke...
On Monday he'll be back at the bench...
You wouldn't think him the same man.
I remember the years you had no home...
The way it affected your whole life.
Now you're at Clichy...
It's airy...quiet...
But talk to us about this problem.
Having no home was frightening.
It's terrible to be at others' mercy.
First we were in a boarding house...
We heard everything through the walls.
And fleas! I wanted to sleep out.
Naturally, I didn't want her to.
I'd never seen a bug before!
I woke up about 5 in the morning...
I didn't know what the spots were.
Then one fine day when I woke...
One of the creatures was on the wall...
The first I'd seen! I gave a yell!
They were nothing new to me.
But Simone wanted to sleep out...
And I didn't want it. The idea was...
Anything can happen at night...
I didn't want her sleeping on the grass.
I had told a friend at work...
And she had said that bugs were...
Funny...like drops of blood on you.
I lay awake all night thinking...
I could feel the blood. It was awful!
I was wondering: are you happy?
More or less.
I'm ashamed to admit it...money.
To do what I'd like...
Devote time to my interests.
It comes to the same, because with money you can do as you like.
Why are you happy now?
I count myself pretty lucky because...
I love my family and I like my job...
Work for me is time wasted...
But you fought...
We both fought for a better life.
Let's forget it...
Ideals can't ...always be realised.
Either you accept or refuse...
What life offers.
One's got to be adaptable...
Anyone wholly adaptable is lucky.
I became a mental battleground...
Part of me adapts, the rest doesn't.
And what happens to the rest?
Well, I keep it intact...
Or rather, I watch jealously over it.
And what is this thing?
The real me.
I think the tragedy of our times...
Is that hardly anyone chooses his job.
You don't select- you fall into it.
You must have...if not a degree...
At least a job...official employment.
Otherwise no papers no work permit.
A man today...What is a man today?
An identity card...a bundle of forms.
That's the man of today, isn't it?
Not everyone's an artist...or even a craftsman now! Now...we're machines...
Fighting boredom in a dull job.
Without interest or purpose...
Yet obviously the job must be done.
It must be endured until 6 o'clock.
After 6 you try to rediscover yourself.
Become another man...another person.
He's alive, real!
But he's still a prisoner...
The working man holds the handcuffs.
Slowly, involvement with one's job...
...must be reduced in favour of...
What I call 'one's marginal life'.
Is there anything you believe in?
I believe in life...I believe...
In the possibility of fulfilment...
In spite of and because of everything.
You're 27, an Italian living in Paris.
These 3 years are in total contrast...
...to your life in Cremona...
In a middle class home.
Here you live in a maid's room...
You're a foreigner, you know men...
You've come to know Paris...
You've made new friends...
Is there anything new left for you?
You spoke of the change in my life...
My maid's room has had its uses...
I spent several winters there.
There was no heating...
I'd never been cold or gone without...
It was a sop to my conscience.
I was glad to have a hard time...
It was the first time I'd ever worked.
I'd wake up at 7, exhausted, but...
Almost glad of the rush hour crowd.
I think I really felt I belonged.
But that...that didn't last.
Now I'm sick of my room and the cold.
I'm sick of the tube in the rush hour.
And I don't...I find human contact...
I dislike it... it's pointless.
But you've some aim... a hope?
To be honest...I don't know.
Sometimes I'm happy to be in Paris...
I feel I've made up for lost time...
When I came here I felt stranded....
I was shut up in myself...isolated...
...when I was in Italy.
I'd exhausted my inner resources.
I wanted to come up against reality.
I wonder if this was the right way.
For example I drink... you see...
I...I wanted to get rid of...
...of alibis when I came to France.
I wanted to live on my own terms.
I've destroyed the false reasoning...
Only to find it again in drink, men...
To put it baldly...in trash.
But what do you mean by reality?
Is it a job that interests you?
Doing what you like? Or is it to live...
..with a man you love, not have affairs.
I want a job that doesn't scare me...
To live with some one...for an hour...
Two hours, a month, two weeks even.
Just to be with him...without...
...any ghosts to stop me loving him.
To get outside myself... to die even...
Provided I'm in touch with something...
Instead of being forced back on myself.
I've not even the right...
To kill myself...It would be an act.
Why are you forced back on yourself?
If only I knew...
Jean Pierre, you're twenty and a student.
How do you make out in life?
Well, I live, I agree...I manage.
Perhaps better than most students.
But only by horrible compromises...
Accepting that I can't change things
Once I accept that I'm hamstrung, then I've no...I've no problems.
I don't think my generation...or any other...can get along...
Until this impotence is accepted.
I'm talking of real incapability.
For example, I failed my exams...
I tried living with a woman...
We tried to make each other happy...
But it went wrong, it was futile...
The same with politics...
Not that that matters much now...
I don't have political theories...
I still have my ideals, of course.
But I don't get worked up over them.
I wouldn't take any positive action.
I can justify myself intellectually.
I've seen what commitment does...
The impotence before obstacles...
Not for me... I've seen so many... practically reduced to tears by it.
Left shattered...helpless...
It applies to almost all of you.
It's my justification to keep out.
But deep down I know it's false...
It's a lack of courage...
Emotionally even egoism.
Despite dreams of high moments...
One's forced to realise...Or I was.
That life's grey...all neutral tints
There's no black or white...
Just varying shades of grey.
I...I feel responsible for it all.
I introduced you to people...
...broken by political experiences.
Not excluding myself...
When you talk of making a woman happy
I know you mean me.
So I feel responsible because... in a way...
I took you out of your own world.
When Jean Pierre says impotence...
Marceline thinks of the word failure
I've felt a failure for a long time.
When I met Jean Pierre...
I did so want to avoid it for him.
I didn't want him to feel like me.
I thought... I would make him happy...
But...it was another failure.
And not only a failure for me...
But a painful experience for him.
Because I think he still loves me.
Up to this point, the film has been restricted...
...to a relatively personal world.
Now it expands to take in the events of the summer of 1960.
Fire away!
If I was a student now, particularly a young man...
...at the age for military service
The war in Algeria would worry me.
You couldn't care less.
Of course I care. Even If it's only because one day...
In a year, two years, ten years...
The Algerian war will be fantastic film material.
You're talking as an artist...
That's all well and good...
If a majority of Frenchmen showed opposition...
What for?
Why, to make this stupid war end!
But why should France give in?
She's got certain rights...
The war'll end in negotiations...
Like every other war
The G.P.R.A. probably can't end it.
That's not the point.
It's become a habit...
Something we take for granted.
Crimes are taking place out there...
And people turn a blind eye.
Students are part of the problem.
That should affect you personally.
I criticise youth today...
For not playing their part.
Your heart's not in it.
The youth you talk of is a myth!
Yes, a myth you've created!
Aspiring youth...glorious...active!
Not so...Active youth, maybe!
We're 20, so we're dispensable!
Everyone seems in a fog at the moment about the Algerian war...
Even people who usually have definate opinions...solutions...
If we're to clear up this mess...
We've all got to take a hand.
Everyone must act, and forget group thinking...abstract words...
We've got to start with ourselves!
Take a gamble, and make France take a gamble...
With the idea that men can finally stamp out this war.
F.L.N.  COUNTER- ATTACKS
DESPERATE NEWS FROM CONGO WHITES
I'd never marry a coloured man.
Why?
In my case, it wouldn't work.
I can understand loving a...
A negro!
You don't like negroes...
You're a sex racialist.
I'm not...it's not racialism.
Unless I felt attracted, I couldn't have an affair with anyone...
Negroes don't attract you?
I don't think it's possible...
But only because I don't want to...
I remember two years ago on July 14th...
I didn't have...but I remember it was the first time...
For the first time at a July 14th ball I danced with a coloured man...
It touched you?
His dancing was so extraordinary.
I must protest...You see in France negroes... are usually liked for their dancing...
I'd like it to be for other reasons.
Right...But we're really here to discuss the Congo...
...with our African friends.
But before we start, I wonder if...
Despite the prominence given by the press to events out there...
Do we in Paris ...feel real concern about it?
Are all of you here concerned, and if so by what?
I know I felt actually physically involved after watching a T.V. report.
After showing some scenes and mentioning some events...
The commentator finished up: "You see how people use independence."
Coming to the Congo, Belgium said:
"Good, there's money to be made."
No that's not right. The first idea was no privileged class, no trouble.
I agree with Landry, It's...
I lived a year in Leopoldville, with the nuns who were raped.
It was ghastly! The Africans were cooped up together...
They weren't allowed in certain parts of the city.
Do other Africans feel involved?
Is there racial unity as negroes?
Do you feel responsible?
Of course.
It's an explosion of anger really.
If it had been two African states...
Other Africans would stay aloof..
But white man and black...
You see...all the African nations were colonies once...
So in a case of white ill-treatment...
They all feel they share the other's sufferings.
This isn't a good example...
But in the case of anti-Semitism...
I'd fight it.. If it's a German Jew...
A Polish, Russian, or American Jew!
Landry, have you noticed...
The number on Marceline's arm?
What do you think it is?
I've no idea.
Couldn't say...I know sailors... tattoo themselves but she's not one.
A fancy of hers maybe?
A heart would look better.
It's not a phone number, too long...
This isn't a V, it's a triangle...
Half of the Jewish star.
The six-pointed star is a Jewish symbol.
The number...isn't my phone number...
As a Jewess, I was deported during the war...
It's my concentration camp number.
I've seen a film about them.
The Place de la Concorde is empty...
Empty like it was twenty...fifteen years ago...I can't remember now.
"You'll see...
"we'll go there...work in the factories.
"We'll see each other on Sundays," father said.
And you used to answer me...
"You're young, you'll come back."
"I'll never return."
And here I am in the place de la
Concorde
I came back, you stayed.
We'd been there six months before
I saw you.
We fell into each other's arms.
Then that dirty S.S. officer...
...hit me in front of you.
You said, "She's my daughter."
He made to hit you...
You had an onion in your hand...
You put it in mine and I fainted.
When I saw you, you asked, "Mother and Michel?"
You called me your little girl...
I was almost happy to be deported,
I loved you so much.
I wish you were here now.
When I came back... it was hard.
I saw them all at the station... mother, everyone...
They kissed me...My heart felt like a stone...
It was Michel who softened it...
I said, "Don't you know me?"
He said, "Yes, I think so...
I think you're Marceline."
Well, Marilou... it's a month since we had our discussion...
It's August now... and there's one thing that struck me.
Two nights ago walking along...
I told you about a question I’d put in this film.
I asked Jacques and his wife: "Are you happy?
They answered: "More or less".
You said you'd give the same answer.
Yet when I saw you a fortnight ago...
You were very depressed, and feeling none too well.
Yet you can answer , more or less?
Once again... I don't know what's happening to me.
It's like ... the 14th July...all over again.
The faces of all the people I'd known were pressing in on me...
I didn't know what to do...
I thought I was done for...
I think things came to a head that night.
Afterwards there were two days of emptiness.
And then quite suddenly...things fell into place...
People became real again...
I left my fantasy world...
Everything became straightforward.
Did it happen suddenly... on its own?
From the moment I began...
To see...the people around me... to feel part of life...
I became ready...ready for anything.
For  ...I don't know ...friendship...
And for love.
And that changed everything?
Yes, but one thing's strongest of all.
Fear...Despite everything, fear!
The same thing may happen as before.
I'll find myself alone again...cut off...
You won't again.
What do you expect me to say?
I can't talk about it.
Edgar tells me you're in trouble.
What happened?
That morning...in the workshop...
I started work again after you left...
Some one told me I was wanted in the office...
I thought it was about my work.
But it wasn't that at all.
The boss said: "So you're in films."
"What's that to do with my job", I says.
"Forget it, it's not that, "he says.
"You've got to change shops."
They never stopped pestering me.
And yesterday morning...
The foreman came up to me and said...
"Finish these ten parts and I'll leave you in peace this afternoon."
So I went all out and did them...
When I'd finished it was nearly
1 o clock...
But he brought me 20 more.
"you're here to work,"he said.
It was too much, I nearly went for him.
I realised he was out to break me...
So I took my cards and left.
I left because Jacques and Gontrand said to me,"You got to go".
"Or you'll be beating them up and that won't do at present."
What prospects have you at Renault?
None.
Won't you be foreman one day?
Definitely no, not a hope!
DESPERATE NEWS FROM CONGO WHITES
So Landry became an African explorer in holiday France.
It's awful...awful!
He's trying to kill it quickly.
The passes are beautiful...beautiful.
It's beautiful to watch.
They come to see animals die...
Such are the joys of provincial life!
St. Tropez is a town... in some ways a village.
It reminds me of black Africa.
The same old houses and red roofs.
St. Tropez! Even in the interior,
Africans talk about it.
I'd heard of St. Tropez in the Jungle.
The women here are very strange!
They wear bikinis and do all they can to attract attention.
Nothing is too fantastic...
When I think that back home... because in some regions
Women wear leaves to hide their sex...
The colonials laugh at us...
But in a bikini a woman hides nothing at all.
It's not such fun being a model...
But I'm getting used to it.
I've got to make a living, and publicity photos bring in a bit.
That's the only reason I do it.
Anyway, the critics are the first...
To ask for a photo, because back home...
It looks good to have a snap taken with a St. Tropez girl.
They enjoy showing it to their friends.
That's taking the mass viewpoint.
There are plenty who don't think like that.
Only a minority.
The masses-and that goes for us- haven't advanced very far.
Catherine, you're silent.
I don't want to think. All I want to do is swim...ski... especially here.
All the same I'd like Sophie's opinion. You know St. Tropez well?
Not really well. You need to live...
...some time in a place for that.
I was here last year...for the shows...
...at the various casinos...
I rented...
...a little villa...Now the stock question is: Enjoying St. Tropez?"
It sounds good to say: "It's a bore."
It's current snobbery to answer: "It's a bore". It's the done thing.
That's it...people are bored everywhere now.
But boredom comes from within.
Because if you've...if you've your own inner life you're never bored.
Very sweet and simple in their little built-up bras!
There are lots of stars here and they draw the producers.
So all the little girls from Paris come with their bikinis and tights...
Their long hair and mascara...
Their eyes made up just so... very chic.
They all hope to meet a producer.
They've everything-except brains, and we can't all have them.
St. Tropez is a really lovely spot...
With fantastic scenery.
A pity about the people! But why hold it against St.Tropez?
Personally, I'm not bored down here...
And that's that.
You know we're making a film?
I heard about it vaguely.
Well, we can't agree.
Rouch thinks life is fun...
I don't.
That's a bit much! I think...
I'm inclined to agree with Rouch.
Why is it fun?
Well...perhaps it's because we're on holiday.
And holidays apart?
We've no experience.
We're not like you...
You go out with Mother at night.
Isn't that fun?
Why is life so dreary suddenly?
I've an idea you...But you don't know the lives French children lead.
Don't these two girls surprise you?
Must be different on the Ivory Coast?
Life's not all the same of course.
At home, at..at six , a girl already...
She has begun to live.
At seven, I could already cook.
We do nothing but school work...
Except for the odd job now and then.
It's a mistake. You should learn.
You shouldn't take life too easy, because one day...
You'll have more to do than odd jobs.
Go on, go on, put your foot there...
Angelo ...put your foot there and hold on here.
Go on, put your foot up higher!
You've made it!
I nearly didn't with you shouting.
I only shouted because you were being so stupid.
Your arms are stronger than mine.
And you can use them even if you don't know where to put your feet!
Take your foot off and hold the rope behind you.
Let go.. and keep away from the rock.
Let go of the rock! Don't be afraid.
You're doing nicely!
Go on, let go!
Put your hand behind and catch the rope.
It's over there, to one side.
Use your other hand.
Now you've seen yourself on the screen, Edgar and I want your views.
First the children...
Did you like what you saw?
Charlie Chaplin's better.
What was your impression?
I don't know. You tell me.
Some say it's not true; others, it is.
What's not true? Cameras can't lie.
The fact is when they tried to express themselves...
They mostly used generalities.
And that's not true to life.
The talk between Landry and Angelo...
...is a mass of generalities.
On the contrary, It's marvelous!
They share the same problems.
It's not true
They made contact. You could say they discovered each other.
It was a meeting of like minds.
In my opinion, it's the truest scene we did because...
We watch their friendship develop.
That Landry and Angelo like each other is obvious...
But that's not my point. The scene is so unnatural, so artificial!
I can't agree, because at the time
I didn't know anything about Landry.
When I began talking to him...
I forgot the cameras. I was caught up in the discussion.
I found the film extremely embarrassing.
Actually part of it was very boring.
But the rest was quite indecent.
I feel that to obtain even the tiniest grain of truth...
The subject has usually to be alone and on the verge of hysteria...
That is, if it's to talk of anything very intimate.
With that method, you'll only obtain artificial Scenes...
Or scenes bordering on-or which in fact are completely indecent.
As for meeting some of these people...
Forgive me , but I'd rather not.
Marilou made me squirm horribly...
She stripped herself too bare.
I thought Marilou was wonderful and
I'm longing to meet her.
To me, Maxie's views are monstrous.
Her reactions are the type which hinder the emergence of truth.
Marilou doesn't act in front of the camera.
She is uninhibitedly in search of herself.
The same goes for Marceline, she talks to herself.
And we're embarrassed because we feel we're intruders.
But in the end that's just what wins us over.
Marceline's sequence is better than the others because she is acting.
They were very personal, intimate memories...
Maybe when I was saying the words...
I was re-living the past, feeling it.
But I wasn't being histrionic between shots as Marilou suggests.
So I can't agree about being on the verge of hysteria. It's not true.
I like the way the film goes from the false natural...
Like the meaningless street interviews...
To a close up of Marilou which never comes off, but is beautiful.
What did you think of the screening?
I found it interesting because...
The argument split into two factions.
They either criticised our characters as not being true to life...
For example ,Jacques accuses Angelo of acting a part with Landry...
Or else they found them too true...
As when Maxie criticised Marilou for stripping herself before the camera.
It means we've reached a stage...
...where we question a truth when it's not an everyday truth.
We've gone beyond it.
When sincerity is a bit more than life-size, it's called ham...
Or else exhibitionism.
And that's the basic problem.
If they are thought actors or exhibitionists, our film is a failure.
But I'm certain in my own mind that they're neither of these things.
But one can't be sure.
They don't really know themselves...
Marceline said she acted the
Concorde scene...
But she didn't.
Or if she did, it was her most authentic side.
Talking of her father was no game...
This film, unlike normal cinema, re-introduces us to life.
People react as they do in life.
They're not guided, nor is the audience.
We don't say, this man's good, another wicked or nice or clever.
So the audience is bewildered by these people they could actually meet.
It feels implicated but would prefer not to be.
Some were moved. I noticed that some were very moved by Marilou...
Others by Marceline or Jean Pierre or Angelo,
So I believe some of our ideas will get over.
Were you, moved?
I've seen the film so often...
The impact's lessened. Still it does move me...
But in a different way...
At first I thought everybody would find the film moving...
Now I see people I'm fond of, like
Marilou and Marceline, quarrelling.
That upsets me. I hoped that audiences would like the people I liked.
We wanted to make a film of love...
But it's turned out an impersonal kind of film, or if not impersonal....
A sort of reaction from reaction, which isn't necessarily sympathetic.
It's a job getting anything across.
We're in for trouble...
The END 
The best seller in the worid is the Bible.
For one reason.
It's the greatest piece of literature of all time.
It's really tremendous, isn't it?
Here are the Shepherds and the Three Kings.
The flight into Egypt.
The childhood of Jesus.
Mary returns to Naz.
Mary find Jesus in the temple.
So you can see how this would be an inspiration in the home.
- You like that, honey?
What's your name?
- Christine.
Well, she's as bright, she's pretty like her mother. Huh?
Christine, you know what my name is? Guess.
Paul. Paul, you know?
- You have a cousin named
Paul, don't you, Chris?
- Yeah.
You can see how complete it is.
The Bible runs as little as $49.95, and we have three plans on it.
Cash, C.O.D., and also they have a little Catholic Honor Plan.
Which plan would be the best for you, the "A", "B" or "C"?
- I'm really not interested unless
I speak it over with my husband.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. You wouldn't want to give him a surprise?
Does he have a birthday coming up?
It'd be a lovely gift.
That's true.
We place a tremendous...
The Bible is still the best seller in the worid, so...
I just couldn't afford it now.
We've been swamped with medical bills.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Robb.
I'm Mr. McDevitt from the church.
How are you today?
- Now, what is this?
- From the church. Sunday.
No, I guess you've got me mistaken.
What name do you want?
- Is this 59 West Fifth?
- No. Across the street.
Oh, my gosh!
And this is the ceiling.
The crowd, they claim...
I don't know exactly... but 30,000 or more attend one mass.
- They pray in St. Peter's.
- In St. Peter's?
Right.
Right in the Vatican.
- I didn't know that myself.
- I didn't either.
Uh, you're Italian, aren't you, Mrs. Imperato?
The guards are not Italian.
- They're Swiss. Did you know why?
- Yes, that I know.
I never knew this.
They're six feet.
See, they're taller than the Italian folks.
Usually... I mean, see, they're six feet.
Now, here's something nice...
A lot of people, they like, to be frank, the print.
It's large. It's a ten-point register.
Isn't that somethin'?
Good night now, and thanks for the order.
How'd you do, Charlie?
- I did a trip.
- Yeah? Good.
- What'd you get?
- I only got one.
A quad. Twenty-five down.
You rabbit! You think you got me beat, don't you?
- I did. I know I did.
- You did.
It's about time.
How'd it go, Paul? Yeah?
You still on one-a-day vitamin, huh?
We'll get him off that brand.
Operator,
I'll call back later.
- Gipper?
- Yeah.
- The Gipper.
- You sellin'them trips, huh?
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm due for a quad.
- I'm outclassin'him.
- I'm due for a "quaddie".
How'd you do tonight?
- I just got two.
- How was the dips?
- Ten and ten.
- Good.
But we lost a little time gettin', you know, back over there.
- Did you go to Spencer? Again?
- No. Webster.
Oh, Webster. Excuse me. Yeah.
Well, of course, the time.
- Takes an hour to get there.
Not much time to work with...
- Well...
If you're not familiar with the terri...
No matter how good a man you are, if you're not familiar with the territory, it's difficult, you know?
Permit me to offer my own alibi.
Any man that's not good at sellin'should be able... should be good at makin'excuses.
Any man that's not good at sellin'...
- should be good at findin'territory.
- Findin' territory.
Where you been?
- Just finishin' up.
- What, you work all night?
And then he shows up at 10:05.
Where's your orders?
Ohhh.
Oh, we got a producer.
- Oooh!
- One of a kind.
- That many?
- I got three singles.
- Yeah?
- I didn't get an order till 8:00 and...
Well, pretty good dips.
Twelve. Ten and ten.
Twenty. Yeah.
Nice lookin' sales. Very good.
Money is being made in the Bible business.
It's a fabulous business.
It's a good business.
And all I can say to people who aren't makin'the money: It's their fault.
Just keep that in mind. The money's out there, and go out and get it.
I, for one, am sick and tired of hagglin' with you people... and pleadin' with you to get you to do what's good for you... and what's good for us.
Instead of...
Friday and Saturday...
Instead of goofin' off or playin' gin rummy or poker, which I think is all very important...
- I think somebody that's out in that territory... should go out and see if this church is in a good neighborhood.
Or if it's in a skid-row neighborhood, meet the priest.
And if you're gonna have a problem, see it in time to let us know... so we can get another church.
You would double your earnings, we would double our volume... and we'd all be a lot better off.
Maybe you see some missin'faces here.
We eliminated a few men.
Not because we were mad at 'em.
Not because we didn't like 'em.
And not because we didn't need the few sales that they made.
But it's a question of the sour apple spoilin'the barrel.
Certain guys have a habit of gettin' a couple of beers... and flyin' off the handle and badgerin' people around and throwin' their weight around.
I want to go on record and I want to tell you all... the next man that gets off base with me, I'm gonna tag him out.
The ball game's over.
You've got a job to do, and you go out and you do it.
I thank you very much. I thank you for coming and for listening.
Don't you worry about it,
Buster. I've had it.
I'm sick and tired of bein' sick and tired.
And it's not good for these guys.
You know, they get undisciplined.
They get disrespectful.
They're full of alibis and excuses.
Thank you.
"If I Were a Rich Man"
Wish't I was a rich man
Boy.
Well...
Wish't I were a rich man
What? I'm in the backyard!
Mr. McDonald, I'm Paul Brennan.
Yeah, well, what the hell is it all about?
Yeah, well, we have a display at the church, Mr. McDonald.
- Yeah.
- And she gave me your name, and that's why I'm here, see.
- She gave her your name?
- She gave me her name.
- Yeah.
- And I'm here because she gave me your name, see.
'Cause we're visiting all the families in there... that gave their names, you know, at the church.
See, this is where I put the approval of the monsignor, you know.
- Yeah.
- See, if you're at the church and you see the display, you say okay and you give me your name.
- I come to see you, see?
- What are you, sellin'something?
- No, I don't know what the hell...
- Lookit, tell her I was here, will ya?
- Yeah, all right.
I'll ask her. I don't know.
- Yeah, okay.
- Hope you get the right
McDonald, that's all.
- Yeah, all right, sir.
I wish't I was a rich man
We place a lot of nurses, people in the phone company.
You know, ladies like yourself.
And you've had education, and you think that you won't get the value from the set.
I know you will, once it's in the home.
I want to say this, by the way, I hope it brings you lots and lots of luck.
Why, thank you.
I just hope I get around to reading it.
- Okay, I'll give you five towards it, okay?
- God bless you.
Now, see, she's making your balance there a lot easier for you.
- All right?
- God bless you.
Bring you a lot of luck.
Why don't I keep my big mouth shut?
Your mother's got an Irish personality. You have.
I'm Irish myself, and Scotch.
That's a good combination.
Well, you're more Scotch than you're Irish, Jimmy.
Well, thank you very much for saying that.
Jimmy, I'll tell you something.
I'll be very truthful.
- I never ran into a mooch like this in my life before.
The biggest mooch
I ever seen in my life!
- You know, I admire you.
- It's like I told Landry down at the office, gimme about ten mooches a day in this business.
- What's a moocher?
- What do you mean?
- Easy to talk into.
- A mooch. Book mooch.
- Oh, really?
- You know, people that read a lot and appreciate books.
- Yeah.
- Don't tell me you don't.
I know you do.
- Well, these aren't the books I read.
- Who was readin' this?
- Me. She don't read.
I'm the one that reads.
- I certainly wasn't reading that.
You'd really love the Bible.
You won't run into people like me all the time.
You're gonna have to work harder.
But you men are doing fine.
I like to see men out, you know, on their own, doing things.
- Independent.
- Right. Get away from companies.
- Get away from people over you.
- Get away from pensions.
- Right.
- And do what you believe in life, just like you.
- Yeah, I'm doin' swell.
- You, you've got a good job.
- No, she don't believe in what she's doin'.
- I don't believe in it.
- She hates her supervisor.
- I don't believe in workin'.
- That's a good job.
Anyone who works for the phone company.
- No, she hates her supervisor.
I like bein' out on your own.
I don't like being, you know, under anyone like that.
- Being independent, sure.
- Mm-hmm. Really.
It gets jerky after a while.
Now, supposin'you're kiddin'us, who do we get in touch with? The FBI?
You have your duplicate here.
As a matter of fact...
- That thing don't mean a thing.
- Let me ask you this.
You mean to say you don't think he's an honest man, Mother, by looking at him?
- You're not literal like I am. I'm-I'm...
She is a livin'saint.
And I have a nephew a priest.
And I have a daughter in the convent.
And I'm a devil.
Now, these people are funny.
They make you laugh sometimes.
They're, you know...
Oh, dear me, dear me.
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen...
I gotta go.
- You goin' back out now?
- Yeah.
- Now, Charlie, how many more day leads do you have?
- Ninety-two.
Ninety-two.
I'll try this one.
Maybe Mrs. Rafferty is home.
Give it a try anyway.
Wish't I was a rich man
I wouldn't be goin' around this shit land
Ohh, shut the window now.
Let's see where I go next.
Get another one of these beauties.
Mrs. Rafferty.
I don't know if Mrs. Rafferty will be home, but I know I'm not home.
Be you sellin'anything?
Naw, we're not sellin'anything.
The Irish fightin' with the English.
When it comes right down to it, it makes no difference to me.
'Cause the English are not payin' me bills.
The Irish are takin' away from me.
Yup! Ah, here's another one here.
Looks a little blitzy.
Geez, I got some beaut's today.
Gippo, the "infarmer".
I'm "infarmin"' you that I'm here.
We do have the Catholic encyclopedia.
They spent four and one-half years.
Now, we can't carry it, but this'll give you an idea.
This is fantastic.
This is the brand-new renowned
Catholic encyclopedia.
Wait till you see this.
This answers 43,000 answers in the faith.
Now, this is terrific.
I'll tell you why.
This has from the Reformation,
Karl Marx, all your religions.
Now, you know theJehovah Witnesses.
They're nice people.
But they know more about our religion,
'cause they have good literature to find out.
Uh... say Communism... you want to look it up.
It's in your Catholic encyclopedia with your comparison to Catholicism...
- their thinkin', the ideology involved.
- Mm-hmm.
It's under "C", sir. But frankly, we can't carry the set, as I mentioned.
It's too heavy.
But this is gonna amaze you.
He's got a good personality.
Honest to God, I mean that.
He thinks I'm givin' him a sales talk.
I'm not. He has.
He's got a good personality.
But this right here is vast in scope, Mr. And Mrs. McDonald.
And they come in red or white.
Some people prefer red and...
- What do you call this?
- This is... I call it antique gold.
That's what I would think, yeah.
But on that... and that you have your choice of colors.
Now, what color would you folks choose on that?
Hmm. Have you got any green?
What plan would be more convenient?
And I know you're sincere.
Boy, it's like a railroad station today.
But what plan would be more convenient, then? The cash?
- Gee, I don't know.
- Or they have a Catholic Honor Plan.
- Good afternoon. How are you?
- Hello.
I'm Mr. Baker from the church.
I'm from St. Brendan's.
Oh, I seen you outside of church, huh?
You're not gonna buy another...
Is this... Are you related,
Mrs. McDonald?
Yeah, by friendship, that's how. My best pal.
- Is this your best buddy? Good.
- Sure.
- Well, I'll tell you, you got a good friend there.
- I know I have.
I told them about those Scotchmen.
What's your last name?
- Wadja.
- Mrs. Wadja, I said, did you hear about the Scotchman... that loaned the Irishman a half a dollar?
I'll ask you. Did you hear about the Scotchman that loaned the...
I've heard many of them. I heard about the one that was gonna get...
No, the Scotchman and the Jew and the Irishman who where gonna get a beating for something...
But, anyway, what about the half dollar?
- Have you ever heard about them?
- I think I have.
I- I can't tell it to you.
But no, you say, "I never have", and I'll say, "You never will".
- See?
- I see.
Now, would you want to pay it each month, then?
Five a month?
Or do you want to C.O.D. It?
I could pay a little deposit on it now to make it binding.
Hey, thanks a lot. Oh!
There you are!
Now you're a member of the family.
That's why we have lumps on our heads.
And this is your receipt. I'll get you a brand-new set.
But I just have to go down to the car, and I'll bring one up.
Hey, I'll just take this out of my car.
I got no pitches.
- None at all, huh?
- Not one in.
One home at all?
Not one.
- You know the one that asked for the Bible?
- Yeah.
She wasn't home. The other one wasn't home. The two of them.
- Well, I have to deliver this.
- All right.
- It's right up the street.
- Okay.
There is a left hand right to the head.
It's a strong left hook to the midsection.
And now they tie each other up.
How'd the battle go?
Well, not much of a battle.
It's a left hook to the head. It misses.
Did you scratch?
Huh?
Yeah. Well, kid,
New England no longer for me.
I'll call up Kenny and tell him he can work the rest of my leads.
I hit 'em with everything but the Chinese fence.
Half the time, I couldn't even get in the door.
I couldn't find the houses.
I spent about two hours on the last one.
Boy, I broke my ass on it.
This is the middleweight championship fight... Emil Griffith.
Well, I'd like to be in it myself.
It's not me any longer.
It's these people.
I actually got in no pitches... because, you know, soon...
"I can't afford anything.
We just don't have the money.
I have a sick kid. My wife is out.
My husband's out of work".
- And this is continual!
Bell Dings]
I'm not thinkin'negatively, but I tried the "gift", relatives in the convent, all the old Mickey stuff.
But these are... this is the most ball-breaking territory I've run in... since Gallivan Boulevard.
Where they're ducking behind the door, phony names and phony addresses.
"Did the Father send ye?"
- Oh, Jesus.
They didn't even ask that.
They didn't care about the Father.
Carol, Grady...
Boy, the names!
The Italians and, uh, the Irish.
And really dead, you know?
No, no enthusiasm.
- You feel like eatin' again?
- I don't know. I feel like, uh...
- Let's go down to Gigi's.
- Oh, no.
- Huh?
- No more fuckin' Italian food for me after these guineas!
- Oh, my God.
- Impoverished Sicilians.
The Irish must have come over in a banana boat.
Lush territory?
You'd have to be a lush to work it.
They say Alaska's good territory.
No, that's a fact.
Remember the time we were going to go to Alaska? Remember?
Paulie, I remember about eight years ago you were telling me... that this business is on the fringes.
- It's still on the fringes.
- It's worse now.
Well, this business reminds me of a surrey, one of those... you know, the little things in the olden days... you know, the wagons with the thing on top.
- Carousel?
- Yeah. Well, a surrey with a fringe on the top.
And they got these little tassels.
Now the way I take this business... only... the tassels aren't even left.
They're nothin'but shreds.
I'm workin' all my new sales on the five-year plan.
Gee whiz. Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
You look like you've had it.
So, how'd you do?
Last call I got one.
And I would've been a little mad had you got it.
- What do you mean?
- Because it was the one that you went next door, you know, and they weren't home, and you went to this one by mistake.
And you pitched there with just the wife.
- Yeah?
- And the husband left the name with me, see?
- The people next door...
- Did you sell him?
- Yeah, I had a little problem selling him.
- It was tough.
- I tried to pitch her, but, you know...
- Yeah, took a long time too.
- Was it cash or what?
- Drew a cash, yeah.
- Good. A Bible, right?
- Yeah.
She said she'd like a Bible, but she wouldn't do nothin' without him.
- I was supposed to go there tonight.
- He was... He was all right.
She's the one turned out to be tough, you know?
This was... She was the one, yeah.
She was very bossy.
- No, but she was all right.
It was him. He says...
- Oh, but yeah, but...
As a matter of fact,
I had to sell him a demonstrator.
I sold him the one I had.
- Yeah?
- And, uh, he says,
"Gee, $40 is an awful lot for a Bible".
So I says, "Well, when you figure out you're gonna have it for a lifetime, it's not a lot".
- So what did he say?
- So she... Then she says she'd go half with him, you know.
First he tried to get the daughter to go half with him.
Then he says he'd go half with her... and she'd go half with him, and this is what they did.
Well, I'm gonna get some sleep.
I'm tired out. It's a long day.
Yeah. I had one phony college guy, you know.
What did he say to you?
He says, "Well, this wouldn't be the appropriate time".
So I said, "Well, how about next year?
Do you think you..."
He says, "Well, in a couple of years it'll be all right".
- What did he say?
This wouldn't be what?
- The appropriate time.
- Well, was he gettin' married or something?
- No, he...
- Should have told him you're not sellin' watches.
Yeah.
You know what...
You know, I'll tell you...
I'll tell you what I-I,
I would have not appreciated.
See, with the way... This was the last call I got there, see?
Hey, look at that mosquito.
Big son of a gun. About that big.
Just flew by your face.
Yeah, he's skeptical, see?
So then I say,
"Well, frankly, if you never took the encyclopedia, you have the encyclopedia in the back of the Bible anyway, you know".
So he says, "Yeah, yeah".
He says,
"But $50 is a lot of money".
So then... then I went into the demonstrators for him, you know.
Then he says, "Forty dollars is a lot of money", you know.
You got your green pants on today, huh?
Green necktie.
You know you're Irish.
The Irish will all be lovin' to see you.
Me father's on the force. He gets a pensi髇.
It's a good job.
He's a fine workin' boy, Pat.
Puts in a lot of time, but he gets his reward.
Gets his reward on the other end.
He retired. He lives it.
He's livin' a good piece of money, then.
He lives for about two weeks after and died.
We're savin' for a trip to, oh, the old fair shore.
Goin' over there.
I'll never forget, when I was a kid... we lived in a tenement, in a cold-water flat.
You know, no bathroom or anything... just a bathroom, but no bathtub or anything.
I never laughed so much in my life.
And, uh, I was going to the junior prom, and we had one tuxedo in the family.
It was my brother's tuxedo.
I'll never forget this to dying day.
See, I had to go to the junior prom, and he had to go to some festivity at MIT.
It was like the guy that... the salesman with one suit, he keeps it under the bed.
So I got there quicker than he did, had the suit, the tux, and was all set and hit the road, you know.
Geez, when he come looking for his tux... to go to the festivity, there was blue murder.
I'll never forget that.
Jesus. Jesus, he used to...
After that, boy!
He caught up with me one night.
"My tuxedo, huh?"
Well, I still got my hat.
It cost me a lot of money, this hat.
Jordan Marsh.
I don't want to seem negative, but I can't see anything here but delinquent accounts.
I'll tell you one thing, Paul.
You're puttin' me... in a very negative frame of mind for the sales meeting in Chicago.
You'll be all right for Chicago.
If a guy's not a success, he's got nobody to blame but himself.
What everybody's got to do is to quit making alibis and excuses... and accept the responsibility of success or failure.
Well, I for one will triple my production for the year of'67, believe me.
Good.
I'm real happy with everything.
I'vejust got one thing in mind
Kenny said a while ago.
It's this making half the money that a guy is capable of making.
I think he's right.
I, for one, I intend to make this next year something.
I, uh... My wife just talked me into buying a big house.
And she wants to have a few more kids and all this kind of rot, so I'm gonna make $35,000 this coming year.
- That's all.
- I believe that. I hope you do.
To me, this is fantastic. I haven't...
What have I been with you, three months?
- Three long months.
- Damn, I wish it was three or four years.
I mean it.
I expect to make $50,000.
Not 35. Or better.
And I think I can do it.
Your next station is Chicago, Uni髇 Station.
- Yours was real good, Father.
- It was great, as usual.
Nice seeing you again too.
The next speaker, of course, needs no introduction to no one.
I'd like to introduce the designer and theological consultant... on the books that we sell,
Dr. Melbourne I. Feltman,
Vice President,
Consolidated Book Publishers.
This is a little token of our appreciation.
I'll try to read to you what we've inscribed on it.
"Melbourne I. Feltman, Ph.D., the worid's greatest salesman of the worid's best seller.
- With gratitude, Mid-American".
- Thank you.
There are many people who know the Bible.
There are many people who can quote from the Bible.
But you're somewhat different.
You know the business.
And what is that business?
Isn't is the business that we hear when... the young boy, Jesus, was lost for a matter of three days or so?
And they said to him,
"Why didn't you follow us?
Why didn't you come with us?
We were worried. We were scared to death. Where were you?"
And he said, very quietly and very simply,
"Whist ye not that I am about my Father's business?"
Now, I don't intend to portray the fact that the Father's business, in itself, is selling Bibles for dollars and cents... and for the commercial aspect of it, but I do believe the good that comes from the selling of Bibles... and the getting of Bibles and the reading of Bibles... is definitely identified with the Father's business.
Some of you, at one time or another, may or may not have had a higher income, but you have never held a higher position of esteem... in the minds of the worid or in your own self-satisfaction... than you now hold, knowing what you're doing... about your Father's business.
Hold your heads very high.
Be very proud of your position.
Stop thinking in terms of Bible peddling, because I am confident that once you realize... what you are doing for others, you in your own esteem will rise so high... not with conceit, but in humility, knowing that you have the privilege and the power... to be of service to others.
And with all my heart, for the coming year and for many years to come,
God grant you an abundant harvest.
Thank you.
Well, I hate to bring up a ridiculous matter like this, but how'd you fellows like the sales meeting?
- It was good.
- All right? How'd you like the sales meeting?
- Sure. Yeah. Okay. Very good.
- Thoroughly enjoyed it.
There's five, six, seven, eight, nine.
- Seventy-five.
- Call.
- Call.
- I'll raise.
Cost you a dollar to raise.
Cost me another half, huh?
- I'll call.
- Call.
- Call.
- No wild cards?
- No, this is a wild card.
- Oh, well, you can't...
We're in too simple a game.
- Yeah.
- It's up to you, Paul.
Well, naturally,
I'm not gonna bet anything.
- I'm gonna check 'em. Beat the queens.
- What do you mean, you check?
- I beat the queens.
- You scared to bet?
I can bet. I know I got you beat.
I'll bet you half.
- I'll take your money.
- Your deal.
- Checking the truth over there
'cause he saw an ace.
- Yeah, that's what he did.
I'm gonna interrupt your game for a minute.
I'd like to, uh, find out everybody's plans... and thinking as far as our trip to Florida... uh, when we can leave... and where you want to leave from.
- I don't care.
- It's immaterial to me.
- Doesn't make any difference to me.
- All right, fine.
It doesn't matter. That's minor.
The main thing is goin' down there.
Yeah. All right, fine.
I tell you, quite frankly,
I look forward to the trip.
- I know you do.
- I don't want my wife to hear it, but I would enjoy basking in the sun.
He always does look forward to the trip.
If-lf the trip is successful, then you want to stay, say, maybe ten weeks?
You might want to go home in the meantime, but ten weeks?
- Go ahead, Ken.
- Tomorrow we're goin' to Florida.
Tonight we're gonna play poker.
- Right. Deal!
- Let's go.
Deal me in.
Too-ra-loo-ra-li
Welcome to the city of Miami Beach.
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral
Sure's an Irish lullaby
"Casablanca".
Humphrey Bogie.
Where the hell is that Fontainebleau? Hmm.
Hmm.
The Fontainebleau.
There you are.
If I'm gonna invest my money in that,
I want to see what it looks like.
Well...
That's it, huh? Hmm.
Hello?
- Hi, honey. How are you?
- Fine. How are you?
- Okay.
- That's good. Where are you tonight?
I'm at, uh... outside of Miami.
It's the Congress Inn.
- Oh.
- It's really beautiful.
There's a swimming pool right out the door.
Oh, my! Jesus, you're livin'like a king.
Yeah, I'm livin' like a king.
Yeah.
But, uh... Yeah, it's really pretty nice here.
- Wonderful. Wonderful.
- That's good.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Well, that's nice.
- What's new up there?
- Nothin'. How are the boys?
- Oh, they're here...
Rabbit and Charlie.
- And Charlie.
And Ray, yeah. Of course, they all pep me up, but, uh...
- Don't drive too fast!
- Oh, I'm not driving fast.
I don't... I mean, just...
- I generally drive around 45 to 50.
- Don't drive 70.
- Are you taking care of your tires? Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Well, that's good, yeah.
- Yeah, I'll take care of that.
- So, anything new at all?
- No. Gosh, no. Nothin'.
This is costing you a lot of money.
- Well, lookit, honey, take care of yourself.
- And you take care too.
- All right.
- And don't drive too fast.
- Okay, I'll keep it below 50.
- Yeah.
- Okay, honey?
- Okay.
- All right, then. Bye now.
- Bye.
- How is she?
- She's feeling pretty good.
You gotta below 50 from now on.
Don't tell her how fast you're going.
- No, well, I mean...
- You'll scare her.
Yeah, she doesn't want to... I mean, she figures you're going 70 miles an hour.
Well, you know, I wasn't...
It's very seldom I go that fast.
But, uh... actually, I mean, it's a question of...
How was it, cold back there?
Oh, colder than the deuce... snow, everything else.
- Get up.
- Ray wants to call.
Operator, did you try my call to Boston yet?
All right. I'm sorry.
I couldn't connect your call.
I'll call again. Thank you.
Come on, let's go swimmin'.
I'll bet you ten dollars you don't go in the pool.
- I'll go in.
- Well, I don't want to take all your money.
- Do you want to go in?
- Yeah, I'll go in.
He's goin'in the water?
What, are you out of your mind?
Why not? What do you think you're down here, all business?
Come on in, Charlie.
Yeah.
Boy, that water is cold.
- Hi. Come on in.
- Mr. Baker?
- Yes, sir?
- Catholic Press. Hope
I didn't catch you too busy.
- Oh, pardon me. Wait a second.
- Thank you very much.
We're calling on all the families from St. Rose.
Just have a seat and be right at home.
I'll try not to interrupt too much.
- Excuse me. Okay.
What's your last name again?
- My name is Turner.
- What was this? Oh, from the church.
- Yes, I'm from the church.
- Just have a seat, Mr. Baker.
- My wife was tellin' me about that.
I'd like to mention, first of all, of course, we're working on the full authority of the church.
I'd like to mention this has the recommendation of His Holiness, Pope Paul.
Uh, I want to mention, first of all, this is edited by Father John O'Connell.
You may be familiar with this.
And it's published by the Catholic Press.
Of course, in buying anything Catholic, you want to look for the lmprimatur.
It's your assurance that, of course, it's approved.
Then in addition to the regular Bible, blended right in with the sacred text, you have all the paintings by the old masters.
See, here's
"The lmmaculate Conception", then here's "The Story".
Now, this has your infancy, childhood and early life, the Annunciation, the wedding.
- Did you ever see so many beautiful paintings?
- That is a..".The Story".
- How would you like to have something like this?
- Well, personally, I...
- It's a nice set, I'll be frank.
- Thank you.
But, Mr. Turner, believe me,
I'm not trying to... The wife...
Now, this may sound odd to you, but she's thinkin' of changin', see?
If you notice, I left my name.
I'm Catholic, and I believe in raising the children Catholic.
It may kind of push her, see?
In other words, she's a different religion and...
May I ask you this, Mr. Baker... and please understand that
I'm just a Bible salesman;:
I'm not a theologian or a missionary...
It would please you if she were to come into the faith and join the church?
- Am I correct?
- Well, I mean, I'd be happy...
- It'd be wonderful.
- On her own, you understand?
See, I don't want...
And besides, you're the man of the house, so this is for your own use.
But, see, the point I'm tryin' to bring up to you was, do you think I'd be tryin'to force her because it's my religion, see?
Well, why would buyin' this have anything to do with her decisi髇?
She's not a Catholic yet.
She may convert. See, that's the thing.
- Well, actually, that's her decisi髇 and not mine.
- I see your point.
- Let me ask you this: Do you like it?
- I think it's excellent.
- Do you think that it's worth the money?
- It's worth, uh...
I mean, for the price, what you receive, it's tremendous.
Could you manage two and a half a week for it?
I certainly could, to be honest with you.
Well, actually, then, there's no reason why you shouldn't have it.
- Is there?
- There's none, for me.
Okay, fine. One.
- You want to pay this ten a month, then?
- Uh...
For a couple dollars a week, there's no reason why you shouldn't.
I don't like to say anything, by the way, but I'm his brother-in-law.
I think you better ask Alice, honest to God.
- I'm... But I'm the...
- Remember the time you bought the magazine?
- You're his who?
- I'm his brother-in-law.
- He's my brother-in-law.
- I was thinking of this, but I'd have to ask my wife.
- You're his brother-in-law?
- He's my brother-in-law.
- Not his father or, or his guardian?
- Oh, no, brother-in-law.
- You'rejust his brother-in-law?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Do you work for him?
Him, him and I are the best buddies in the worid.
Well, do you live here or anything?
Where do you live?
Oh, yeah, I live right here too.
If she did resent this, it would kind of, it'd hurt me,
'cause I think she'd like it.
But the only thing, I don't think I'd be pushing her... because I think what it would be for the, for the children.
And he brought up a very good point.
It's not anything, not selfish.
I think I will try it.
Yeah, I was just thinking of that statue.
That didn't cost anything like this, and she was kind of peeved at that.
Just a minute... brother-in-law.
Are you trying to help me?
If you are, I could do without so much help.
- I don't care if he buys it.
- Oh, wonderful. I thought you did.
- I'm glad you clarified that.
Very good. Good.
- I just happen to know his wife.
I'm glad that you don't object.
Thank you very much.
- Do you want it?
- I do.
Well, then, quit making excuses and sign right here.
Okay, I'll go along with it, because I'm tryin' to figure...
Quit figurin'and start writing,
Mr. Baker.
Oh.
- Is this it?
- Yeah, that's it.
- This is the good one.
- That's the brand-new one.
After all, you've got to have everything brand-new.
You don't want a blot on your escutcheon. Let's go to work.
I want to get going, you know.
I'm takin'off like a bird.
Okay.
Okay, sir?
I'm bip-bip-bippin'
Da-da-da-da-dee-do
Eee! Ah-ho!
All cleared off, ready to go.
My hat.
Tell me where you got that Irish brogue
And before you left Killarney
Did your mother kiss the blarney
And that little touch of brogue you can't deny
You know what Paulie's father told him?
When he was young, he says, "Mr. Brennan..."
- Now, he came right from Ireland.
- Oh, yes?
"If you're smart now", he says,
"you'll join the force and get a pensi髇".
Oh, and did he?
He's a strong breath of a man.
God, God bless him.
He's over there.
He's-He's livin' right in that cemetery.
He got a big headstone.
Oh, even the father said he'd never seen anything like that headstone.
Beautiful headstone.
I can see him now in his uniform with the shiny buttons.
Yep.
9:43, WUAF's 24-hour music time.
"Opa-Locka City Hall".
"Sharazad Boulevard".
Pardon me, can you tell me where 118th Street is?
You just... instead ofjoggin' to the left, jog to the right.
Yeah. Jog to the right down there?
- Yeah.
- Okay, sir. Thank you.
Another jog again.
Jog to the right.
Jog to... Jog to the left.
Jog to the right.
"Opa-Locka Boulevard".
Dang it all.
Damn it all.
Do you know where 118th Street is?
I think you gotta go all the way up this way, up into Opa-Locka.
Yeah, Opa-Locka.
This is Opa-Locka, isn't it?
- Well, it is and it isn't.
- Yeah, I see. Thank you, sir.
- The numbers are all over here, as far as streets go.
- Okay, sir.
Yeah... he sure knows.
"Sinbad Avenue".
Sinbad the sailor.
What's this?
Sinbad Avenue.
Ah, here it is.
Opa-Locka City Hall.
Damn it all!
Goddamn!
One-eighteen.
One-eighteen, eighteen
118 Street. How does that go into a terrace?
118 Terrace.
That isn't what I want.
Where the hell is 118 Street?
Jesus Christ!
Boy, this should be located so that you could go to street after street.
So I'm looking for 20th Street.
No 20th. 21 st, 23rd. 22nd.
"Jog off down here", he says.
Jog off! Jesus. Jog off.
There's two different streets on one street.
- I don't know.
I was in a Muslim district.
- A what?
- A Muslim district!
- What do you mean by that?
A Muslim district?
Well, they're not...
How can you have...
- Did you meet Cassius Clay?
- No, no. I was in a Muslim district.
Kandahar Street... and Sinbad.
And what kind of stuff is this?
Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.
- I mean, what kind of stuff...
Open Sesame.
All I could think of was fairy tales, you know?
What kind of stuff is this?
Aesop's fairy tales.
It's not the bum territory.
It's the bum in the territory.
If I told anybody like that, I mean, they'd say you were drinking again.
This Kan... Kandahar Road,
Sinbad Road.
This thing is stupid, 'cause every time you go on the street...
- there's a canal.
- Canal or railroad.
- Or a railroad. Or an old bridge.
- Or an airport.
- Or an airport.
- Or a graveyard. Opa-Locka.
Or a graveyard.
Opa-Locka, Opa-Locka.
Christ, the guy that laid this city out must have been a stiff artist.
Okay, now, when Nick wants to go courting with Bessie, his cow.
It's a pleasure to meet a nice guy like Pete... who thinks that my cooking is the best you can eat.
Merry Christmas!
Silent night, ho...
Take that cream away from The Rabbit and pass it down here.
- I have one here for you.
- Oh, do you?
You gonna rob her cream?
I got on my buddy Bull yesterday.
I want to kiss and make up with him.
He pouted at me for about two or three minutes.
You do that, then I'll really get mad.
- He's a pouter, all right.
- What'd you say?
Well, I don't want to give nobody a hard time, but I just want everybody to realize the potential is here... and we got a job to do, and I don't want no more excuses.
You know, geez, we come down here to work.
And if you kid yourself and say, "Well, it ain't there. It can't be done".
Or if you sell it short, that's the main thing.
Then, then you're in trouble.
But today... we want to hit 'em early.
Wrap this up as soon as possible.
Get out there and get 'em.
Okay, Bull, boy, you eat like you're successful.
"Many are called, but few are chosen".
The Gipper...
The Rabbit, The Bull... and myself.
They all bear the names of different types of animals.
The Rabbit is a very impulsive guy.
He sells, he has a lot of energy and he's young.
He doesn't have the... possibly the class of the... that the other salesmen have.
Maybe it's because he doesn't have the maturity.
It's brand-new. It's revised.
It teaches the children.
- Yes. Yes.
- It's in color.
They spent a long time to revise it.
See, it's not complex.
I don't understand very well the English.
You know, I know the basic things, the principles.
I understand you, but I miss many things.
Right. That's why I speak, if you'll notice,
- Yes. Yes.
- Very, very slow.
Could you see where this would help the family?
I mean, honestly, could you see where this would help the children... and Frank and yourself?
Could you... I mean... See, what
I'm tryin' to explain, Mrs. Pages, could you see where this would be of value in the home, a gain to you?
Could you see where this would help?
- Could you see where a Bible as nice as this...
- Yes. No.
I understand your point, but, uh, really I don't think we can now...
- Maybe later. I interested later.
- Right. Right.
- But right now, no.
- No, I understand your point.
- Sure, no.
- Now, you're Spanish, right?
- Yes.
- We do take orders.
Wait till you hear this.
- You're gonna be very enthused.
Wait till you hear this.
- But... -
We do take orders, and you're gonna be enthused.
- We take orders.
- What?
- Orders.
- What's that?
- We take orders on the new missal.
- Orders?
- You know, for mass.
- Yes.
We have one, finally, with all the changes.
- Do you understand my point, Mrs. Pages?
- No.
- You go to mass, right?
- Yes.
- Sunday?
- Yes.
- What do you bring to mass?
A missal... right?
- Yes.
- You know, to follow the priest.
- Yes.
We take orders on 'em, the new one.
They're released, finally.
Uh-huh. Yes.
See, in other words, on the missal you bring to mass.
- Yes.
- They're released, and we take orders on them.
- You know, for mass, the missal?
- Yes. I have one.
- Yeah, we have the new one with all the changes.
- Yes.
- You know, all the ecumenical changes in the mass.
- Yes. Yes.
- We do have them available, finally.
- Yes.
After about two years.
So would you like one?
No.
The Bull, you can draw him.
He's a big, powerful man, and he's got a lot of stamina.
Probably hasn't got the, the technique that Charlie has, but he certainly makes up for that with the stamina.
I would love to, but I really don't have the time now, and I couldn't possibly take on anything at the moment.
- I'm lucky I'm eating right now.
- You know what it is?
We show the whole library.
But a lot of people are interested in only the Bible.
But if it was a dollar a month,
I couldn't even take it on.
I'm awfully sorry.
- I want to thank you for your time.
- Okay. Thank you, anyway.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.
- And this is the Catholic one?
- Yes, that's the revised Douay.
How much is something like this?
Well, we have different bindings, if I could explain.
What would the least expensive be?
Well, do you have a minute? I could show you through the whole library?
- Do I have to have a whole library?
- Not necessary.
If you want the library, fine; if you want just the Bible, it's wonderful.
- Yeah. Do you want to come in?
- Please, yeah.
It comes back to the old adage:
It's 99 percent perspiration and one percent inspiration.
You gotta get out there, and you gotta push, push, push, push, push.
And once you've lost that push, you've had it.
The Gipper is, uh... unemotional.
Straight man. He does...
His selling is extremely effective.
Extremely effective because... he knows how to take advantage of everything... in any circumstances.
In your honest opinion, have you ever, ever seen a more beautiful...
- No, I haven't.
- Now, isn't that really somethin'?
- It's so complete.
- Now, incidentally, this comes in the white or red.
We find most of the folks choose it in white.
Uh, what are you gonna do?
You gonna write this up?
Yes, uh-huh.
Now, do you want that in white?
- You want this... white?
- It's up to you, darling.
No, it's not up to me.
It'll be next month before we can even do anything.
- At least. At least.
- That's all right.
Can you make it for two months before it would come?
Sure.
It's up to yourself.
See, they mail it out at your convenience.
In other words, we can't be in everyone's home when it would be more convenient.
How much would we have to start with?
Just the one payment, or wouldn't you want another payment?
Basic. Basic idea.
That's right.
That's the nice part of it.
Because they have no collectors.
Nobody comes to your home.
And any time you want to liquidate it sooner, you can.
Now, you don't want anything from us today?
Yeah, just the "C".
See, in other words, they have the "A", "B" or "C" plan.
That's what I was asking you, if you wanted this today.
- Yes. See, this is suggested...
- I can't give you that today.
- Oh, well, that's all right.
No problem.
- It's impossible.
What part of that can you apply on it?
- I can't give you any cash today.
- How about a check?
No. We don't have a checking account.
The only cash we have in the house has to get us through till Friday.
- That's what I was trying to ask you.
- Oh, I see what you mean.
See, a lot of times we'll come into a home, you know, and a customer will say,
"I have the insurance money, the milkman's money.
I can always see them".
No, everybody's paid already.
Can I just make one more suggestion?
- I've had this happen an awful lot of times.
- Yeah.
Oh, you have... She knows what I'm going to say, don't you?
- What am I gonna say?
- Probably gonna say,
"Borrow it from somebody".
- If-If you know...
I mean, not unless you know them.
- No. No.
But if you've been here long enough, usually...
The neighbors are in worse shape than we are. What are you talkin' about?
Maybe you can lend 'em a couple of bucks.
- They're ready to repossess their house next door.
- Oh, God. Yeah?
- Do you mind if I say something, Charlie?
- Go right ahead, Jim.
See, what they usually do... See, this is what they suggest in the home office.
But we actually meet the people.
We know the... you know, they're nice, sincere people.
But what I want to ask you...
What part of the "C" could you put?
- Who's the bookkeeper?
- Could he put down as little as six?
Yeah, at the end of the week when he gets his paycheck.
You know what I'll do? I'll send one of the men from the Catholic Press.
You'll like this fellow.
Mr. Brennan. Paul R. Brennan.
- Brennan?
- Yes. You may have read about him in the Catholic News.
I'll send Paul by to pick up the down payment.
As a matter of fact, you know what I've seen him do?
In one day, five different times, he's laid out ten dollars for five different people.
Fifty dollars.
And, well, the reason for this... not that he's fanatical, but he's very devout.
He's a very devout Catholic, and he feels that every Catholic family should have this.
Gee, I get a kick out of him.
He's a character, that Char.
Char is a wonderful guy.
He keeps the ball goin', rollin'.
What's this, 121 st I'm on?
Yeah, 1010.
I think I got it.
Do you feel like something like this in the home would be helpful, Mrs. Gorman?
You know, where you're at, you seem like a pretty mature woman.
Do you feel something like this would be actually, you know, a more of a family get-together?
Well, I'm all by myself, so...
I placed this Bible with a woman that had close to 15 Bibles.
You know what she said?
She received a lot of solace just lookin'at the pictures.
And she was a woman that had a Ph.D.
I had a cum laude myself.
"Come no more" from one of the colleges.
My brother was a little different... magna cum laude.
But mine was "come no more".
When he was going to school, he was classified as a genius, and so I followed him in school.
And when they came to me, everybody used to say,
"Where did you come from, Paul?"
So, you know, I got kind of an inferiority complex.
And 'course when I got married, that made it worse.
But anyway, would you be kind enough to write out your address?
Well, I don't know how many years I have to read the Bible.
Well, let me say this. I told...
This one woman said, she said,
"Believe you me, Paul", she said...
Well, I mean, most of the time they call me Paul.
It's Mr. Brennan, but to me
I don't think a title "mister" means anything, but...
- What is your first name, Mrs. Gorman?
- Chrissea. C-H-R...
- What is it, dear?
- Chrissea.
- Chrissea. That's a very unusual name.
- C-H-R-l-S-S-E-A.
- And that's five dollars a month.
- Uh-huh.
Could you make that $ 7.95 and make it even?
All right, dear. Now,
I'm puttin'the five dollars...
That's the... I'm gonna cut this down to three on the service charge.
You've been very lovely.
And I know what it is, and I enjoyed...
Whether you took the Bible or you didn't take it, it's very enjoyable talking to you.
- Thank you.
- And this is not the Irish blarney, believe me.
- This comes right from the heart.
- I had an Irishman for a husband.
You did, dear?
My mother was of Protestant denomination.
I don't know actually what denomination you are, sir, but she belonged to the High Church of England.
- Yeah.
- And she was the roughest that you...
I mean, I said, "Gee, Ma, you're supposed to be English".
I said, "You know, generally they're a little more complacent, a little placid".
But I said, "You've got
Spanish blood in you or something".
Boy, she had a fiery temper.
But, um...
Well, I'll tell you one thing is this. She...
I'll never forget. Of course, my father never hit me in his life.
He never struck me in his life, and my mother really massacred.
I guess I really needed it, and...
I always felt
I never got enough beatin'.
- Huh? Well, I imagine your mother was pretty strict too.
- No. Well, she was real...
- How about your fa...
- My father?
- He hit you, huh?
- Well, he... Not his giris.
He might've hit the boys, but the giris, hejust shook them a little bit.
He just shook them.
But the boys, he really beat up, yeah.
- Grandma wouldn't let him.
- Yeah. Yeah.
Would you mind writing your name and your address right here?
Well, you got me, because
I don't have my glasses.
That's all right, sir.
Try these. Try these, sir.
See how those are.
I know. I know.
You just use reading glasses, I bet.
You have a lovely home here.
Well, it's simple.
It's good enough for us.
Do you know Father Riley and
Father Sullivan over there?
- Father Sullivan, uh-huh.
- Well, he comes from my neck of the woods, you know?
- Oh, really?
- Sure. He comes from Jamaica Plains.
The little city I'm in, they say that you bought it for a pot of beans and a jackknife.
- Taunton.
- Oh, you come from Taunton?
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, by golly, let me shake you again.
They have the Raynham Racetrack down there and all that.
- Yeah, the silver shops.
- I don't know what the zip code is.
You'll have to have the zip code.
You have it on your...
Uh-huh, 054.
You can tell who does all the writin' around here.
Okay, then.
He's got my signature on it.
I guess I'll have to buy it.
All right, sir. You look like a cash buyer. And God bless you.
He's gonna wear that hand out.
He should have been a Protestant preacher.
You know what you have? You have a sense of humor, which most people lack.
- In my job...
- They call you a G-man, huh?
Yeah. In my job, I have to have a sense of humor. If you don't, you'd go nuts.
Yeah. How long you work with the sanitation department?
- Twelve and a half years.
- Twelve and a half years.
And as I said before, the important part is, have it blessed... because if it's not blessed, you will not get the benefit out of it, you know.
- Yeah, I just came over to pick up the down payment.
- Oh.
Um... I don't want it.
- Because he's already mailed the order in.
- Oh, he did?
Yeah, you see? Gee, I'd appreciate it.
I mean, I don't want to seem...
But he already mailed the...
See, I'm the district manager.
And so I've already put his order in on it, see?
And I'd appreciate it... You know, it's something that you'll really love.
- Yeah, I know we would.
- And six months from now, let me face it, Mrs. Woodhall, you won't be a cent richer or poorer, and you've got a lovely set...
'cause it comes with the full endorsement of the church.
- You know, it's really...
- I promised my husband
I wouldn't. I told him.
I charged Mr. McDevitt with the order because I have to do it.
In other words, the cost of the mailing and the handling and everything, plus bookkeeping.
I have to give him a penalty.
I don't like to do it, but that's the way the company is.
- How much is the penalty?
- Huh? Well, I charge him $ 7.25.
And I have no control over that.
That's the company...
- All right, you call me tonight, and I'll...
- I won't be here, dear.
See, I've got to move out into another... See, I made a special call over here today.
Well, is there anyplace
I can call you around 5:00?
No, ma'am.
I'm gonna be in Jacksonville.
You'll love the books when they're delivered.
All right.
Thank you, dear.
These tires. I told you, they're no fucking good.
- No, what I would do is this:
Before I even jack that up...
- Put the brake on.
But that jack is at an awful angle.
Oh, well, I'm pretty proficient in all departments.
Oh, boy!
I tell you one thing.
Here I do find that the people are very, you know, not bad.
No, no. They're very receptive.
I got a fantastic reception.
- You know what I mean.
- I mean, I did. I had one guy wouldn't even come to the door.
But you can expect one of them wherever you work.
They treat you with a lot of courtesy and a lot of respect.
It's a lot better than that
Gallivan Boulevard in Boston.
You're not gonna knock Boston, are you? That's your home.
- Well, I like Boston still.
I'm homesick too, believe you me.
- I'll tell you truthfully,
I'm very homesick.
- Homesick?
- Naturally! I've been away quite a while, Kenny. I mean...
- Four days?
Four days? I'm out a lot...
Let me see, is it four days?
- It's a lot... Let's see.
When did we leave?
Seems like four weeks.
But I made enough calls to know this territory good.
- Hi, Jim. How'd you do?
- Hi, Charles.
I want to know how The Rabbit done?
Ah, not too bad.
I got a couple.
- Yeah?
- Ray did good himself.
He got a couple.
- Double and a single.
- I called on one woman.
- She was a Mickey, you know.
- Yeah.
And so I give her the old romance, anyway, and I came up...
Oh, I worked it up. I had to work...
I tried to develop a C.O.D. On it, you know?
She didn't go for it, so...
And then getting that
$50.80 outta her, you know.
- That's a nice sale, though.
- Well, I... It was...
- Yeah.
- Well, I wish I had ten of them a day, believe you me.
- I tell you this way. I'd be...
- Would you believe ten a week?
I'd be happy.
I had a flat tire to begin with. You know, I'm not giving you excuses, but...
I'm glad you clarified it.
It sounds like it.
How about tomorrow?
Well, I'd like to get a very early start and see if I can bang out a good day, you know?
Really push it out. Get about four quads, and I'll be all set.
All right. We'll see.
Good morning.
Mr. Brennan from the church.
Mrs. Gloria Fuller?
How are you today?
You're either interested or not interested, you know what I mean?
I'm very sorry, but my sister just called and she's waiting for me right now.
- I'm very sorry. Okay. Thank you.
- Okay. All righty.
Could you see where this would be helpful to you, Mrs. Groza?
Well, it's beautiful.
I mean, who can afford it?
Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.
You're gonna be amazed when I tell ya.
No, you see, like anything else, uh, to afford something like this, as I say, it's not like buying a new car, you know?
I get it. I place this in homes where there's been 18 and 19.
You know where Gloucester is,
Mass... the fisherman at sea?
I placed it with one woman with 18 children.
And believe you me, as they say, it wasn't easy.
But in this life, if you have a desire for anything, you'll get it.
- Isn't that true?
- Well, sometimes.
"Where there's a will, there's a way".
That's what Charlie Gipper says, you know.
You probably heard of him.
Notre Dame? The Gipper? Hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Well, sometimes you can't.
Well, let me put it this way.
There are a lot of folks in this worid that spend thousands of dollars on material things.
- But what I mean is this.
Do you love it?
- Eh?
- Do you love it?
- I have one... not as good as this.
That's all right, but do you think you'd appreciate that, Mrs. Groza?
- I appreciate it, but I don't see use to buy now.
- How about you, sir?
- You're the breadwinner, right?
- Yeah, but I never read the Bible.
Yeah, well, then...
I mean, as I said before,
I could ask you one thing is this.
Do you think the dollar a day would really hurt you?
- I wouldn't wanna place it if you couldn't afford it.
- It sure would!
- I can't buy that now.
- You can't afford that dollar.
- Wejust can't right now.
- Can't afford that dollar a week.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Well, we're all up to here.
I'm over here.
- Well, I don't get any deeper.
We can wait on it, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Well, the only thing I can say...
- I'm sorry you make the trip and everything.
- No, no, dear.
- I didn't know what it's all about.
- That's all right.
- It's like my business.
- Yeah. Huh?
- Like my business.
I sell vacuum cleaners.
- Oh, you do?
You sell vacuum cleaners?
You scoop 'em up, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Well, that's all right.
We scoop 'em up too.
Well, you're a salesman.
You know.
You know, I had a vacuum salesman come to my wife, you know.
But he threw all the dirt over the floor,
- and then he walked out and he didn't scoop it up, you know?
- Maybe he needed a new bag.
I don't know, but, uh...
Oh, I guess that's the thing in everything.
If you don't scoop it up, you don't win, huh?
- And that's...
- Yeah. He needed a new bag, probably.
Yeah. And with that,
I will say fond adieu.
Because I have a lot more calls to make.
- Hi, Mrs. O'Connor.
Mr. Brennan from the church.
- Yes?
How are you today? This is on a display we had at the church.
It will only take a minute.
Could I ask you this question?
And I know what you're gonna say.
What part of the set do you like the best?
Which part of this complete library do you like the best?
- Which do I like the best?
- Yeah.
Uh...
Which would you consider...
Which would you say is the basic part of the library?
Or what's something which would appeal to you or which you would derive the most out of?
- I personally think the Bible.
- That's right.
That's what most people say.
Mmm. I have one that I wouldn't part with for years for nothin'.
- Yeah.
- I've had it for years and years... that, uh, belonged to my mother-in-law, and I don't know where she got it from.
I have the old family Bible.
I bet it's over 200 years old.
Well, I'd say close to a hundred, anyway.
Oh, no. By no means, ever part with a Bible. I had one myself.
In fact, uh, my husband said his mother read to him every single day out of that Bible.
- Well, as I say, sentimental value attached to it.
- That's something.
Well, I could see where you would choose the Bible, and I'll tell you the reason why.
That's why the Bible is the best seller in the worid.
Hmm, well, actually, I can't see buying another Bible when I already have one.
Even though it's 200 years old?
Well, you're probably tight now.
Is that correct?
- Oh, that's for sure.
- Yeah.
Well, as they say, it's the only thing that I know... that you secure in a lifetime that doesn't depreciate.
A car, after three years, is worth nothing.
A Bible like that will build you something... that will really build up a heritage in the home.
- It is a beautiful book.
- Isn't it beautiful?
I know you love it.
Honest to goodness, Mrs. O'Connor,
I've been in the Bible business now...
The reason I'm in it, I know
I'm placing something in the home... that people will never be dissatisfied.
The longer they have it, the more they will enjoy it.
It's like a good wine... with age it improves.
And they don't repossess the Bible, if one month you don't mail in the payment.
You mail in the payment the following month, that's all.
All right, Maureen.
You've been on that phone long enough.
And if you didn't like it, Mrs.
O'Connor, I wouldn't spend the time.
But most of the people that I do place it with are with the Irish people... because they are very devout
Catholics, you know that.
- Oh, but I'm not Irish.
- It doesn't make any difference.
- Are you not Irish descent?
What descent are you, dear?
- No. Polish.
- Polish? Well, the Polish are good people.
- Oh, yes.
I know a lot of good Polish people.
They're very devout Catholics.
It doesn't make any difference.
But the Irish I happen to place an awful lot with, because I'm of Irish heritage myself.
But as I said before, don't think...
In Worcester, I had all the Polish section there.
Believe you me, we placed more Bibles than you could shake a stick at.
- Everything in this life is a sacrifice, all right?
- Oh, that's for sure.
How about six months from now?
Who knows what six months is gonna bring?
Well, nobody knows what the next day is gonna come. You know this...
That's why I don't want to take the chance of committing myself.
It wouldn't be too much of a chance.
It involves $49.95 for the Bible.
And that's not much, you know what I mean?
A carton of cigarettes a week costs you three dollars.
Does Dad have a birthday coming up?
Well, I'm sorry.
Not at this particular time.
Do you want to reserve it for any later date?
No, 'cause I don't know what's gonna...
Well, nobody knows. The only thing we're sure of is death and taxes.
Right.
No, I don't think
I'd better commit myself.
I honestly can't see my way clear to it right now.
How about in three, six, nine or twelve months? You still couldn't see your way clear?
Well, I don't think
I'd better take it at this time.
Hmm.
Well, I don't think there's any more
I can add to it, Mrs. O'Connor.
I imagine you make a lot of decisions in this life.
- I know my wife...
- Oh, yes. You have to.
- You have to.
- That's for sure.
That's for sure.
But, like anything else,
I think this would be a wise decisi髇.
- But that's your opinion...
- If circumstances were different,
I'd say yes.
- I wouldn't hesitate because it is a beautiful piece of art.
- Mmm.
I mean, actually, is it the dollar a week that's holding you up, Mrs. O'Connor?
I mean, I don't understand.
Really, honest to God.
I've been selling Bibles for ten years.
I don't understand a dollar a week.
Well, it doesn't sound like much, but there's other things that
I gotta take care of first... before I can start putting out another four, five dollars a week.
- A month.
- A month, rather.
No, there's too others... too many other ones that I've got to pay up first.
Okay, then.
I'll bid you a fond adieu,
Mrs. O'Connor. Thanks again.
All right.
Thank you for your time.
That's all right.
That's my job.
Hi, Mrs. Curran. Mr. Brennan from the church. How are you today?
- Yes, I'm fine.
- This is my associate.
I'm not interested, really.
I don't have the time, and I don't have any money.
- So there's really no point...
- Yeah, I was just wondering why you left your name...
Thank you.
Hasn't got the time and no money.
Why did she give me her name?
After four years of trying to find her.
- See how these cool off Wednesday?
Know what I mean?
- Yeah.
By Wednesday, you might as well throw them in the river somewhere.
This is worse than New England.
Hey, Paul, good luck to ya, if I don't see ya.
- Relax a minute.
- End of the tirade.
- Relax.
- It's gotta be changed around.
I'm not workin' any more afternoons... period.
I'm workin' the way I wanna work and when, the way I wanna go out.
- Relax.
- 'Cause this thing is, uh...
I might as well be shooting myself in the sun.
This is absolutely no good in the afternoon.
Good luck, Paul.
- Bye-bye.
- Good luck.
Join the force and get a pensi髇.
What do you think this is here?
How about a Mickey?
Like a Mickey? A Mickey lead?
Mrs. Lynch?
She'll probably tell me to join the force and get a pensi髇.
Oh, this guy here.
I like him.
That's one Bible and a C.P. E...
Catholic People's Encyclopedia.
Which plan would be the best for you?
Well, I'd have to get it for six a month.
And this is where you put your name. Right there.
That's where I sign my...
"John Henry".
We got a new record here the other day.
You know, one of these Beatles songs.
That's off a tape. This, um...
The tape gives a better, more rounder tone.
Doesn't interfere with what you're doin', does it?
Oh, no, no, no.
Now you're gonna put 20 down and when it arrives, pay the balance.
You don't mail in the first payment.
Make the first payment C.O.D.
To the postman.
The first is just like the 26 down.
Now that brings your balance down to $67.90.
Now, four weeks after you receive your books, then you mail in the payment.
In other words, it'll be about eight weeks from now you're going to mail in your payment.
- Oh, I see.
- You see, it's just like putting 26 down.
- Will they send you a...
- They'll send you a budget book and the envelopes.
Telling you when it's due.
Yeah.
Every time you mail in a coupon, you mail in at least six.
Yeah. Okay.
Where will it go to?
It'll go to, uh...
We have two offices, one in Chicago, one in Charlotte, North Carolina.
- They'll give you the envelopes with which one to send it to.
- Okay.
See, right there.
Okay.
Well, that's that.
- I enjoyed the visit.
- Oh, I know you'll enjoy the Bible.
And again, I'm sorry to hold you up on your dressmaking.
I'm going to make my heathen husband read it.
Well, I've got to go to work at 12:00, so...
I'll let him take it to work at night so he can read it.
- Sure. Bye now.
- Good-bye now.
While he's doing nothin'.
Good night.
Doing nothing? My goodness sakes.
What do you think I do at nights?
Oh, you're riding around in that car on a chilly night like this?
- Thanks again, now
- You're welcome. Bye-bye.
Hello, Paul.
- What happened?
Did you get a haircut?
- Huh?
- Did you get a haircut?
- I got a short one.
You look like a Schweinehund.
I got a thin one.
I got a thin one.
What happened to your stomach?
The brakes went today.
I'll say that.
- Luck.
- How'd the battle go?
God, I went through there. I had no trouble finding any of the places.
Do you know how many pitches
I made all day? One.
One pitch.
I got one deal in for the week.
I got a couple I might...
I got Collins up there.
I might be able to knock off a quint with her, but no action.
I can't get any action out there.
I can't see any deals here.
Every time I get in the house, all I hear is...
I mean, the brush-off at the door.
And, uh, you know, real rough.
These Mickies were rough.
Really rough.
Did you find... You know, you found that's probably similar to yourself?
I find here, and if you analyze it, you don't have that many
Catholics here.
You don't have that many Catholics.
One church.
You cover a hell of a wide area, and there's not that...
And, goddamn it, I don't know how many times you have to go back to get these people in.
Boy, I went through eight leads like as if right through a tin horn tonight.
Bingada, bingada, bingada, bingada, bing.
I've analyzed it myself, and I think there are areas...
The rich areas are tough.
They're rough.
But believe you me, if you get in there... and you get the point, you have no trouble with that money.
And you can shoot a quint and, you know, it doesn't break...
'cause, what the hell, they can shoot the money out there.
They got money to work with.
But I'm not thinkin' negatively, but even if I got for the week, say, I got ten or eleven sales,
I wouldn't be happy with it either because...
It's croakin'you, Paul.
You're in a bad frame of mind.
- Well...
- You're having a rough couple of weeks.
There could be something croakin'me.
These people are croakin'me.
Paul, you're fightin'them.
They can spot it a mile off.
You get a week or two of good production under your belt, you'll be okay.
A woman wanted a C.P.E., you know?
Four kids.
Hit her with the buck a week.
Too much money.
You know, it's ridiculous.
No husband. I don't know where the hell her husband went.
I may be wrong, but I can't see it here.
We place it in the home for as little as $49.95, complete.
Isn't that amazing?
Now, this will all be changed pretty soon, won't it?
No. Are you with the Knights of the Holy Name?
- No, I'm not Catholic.
- No, he's not Catholic.
But he follows me right along and all that.
Well, I'll tell you. You know what I appreciate, honest to gosh?
When you go into a home and it's a mixed marriage, we find in many cases the husband is much more enthused... oftentimes than we, even as cradle Catholics.
I wish you were selling a children's encyclopedia instead of this.
Yeah, let me put it this way.
None of your children would ever get a sunburn... or they'd never get a cold unless they were exposed to a draft.
They'd never get a sunburn unless they were exposed to the sun.
The mere fact they're exposed to it, they're going to receive so many benefits from it.
They have to, you know.
'Cause if it never does them any good, it'll never do them any harm.
- It's kind of a fancy Bible for a little child, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- What do you mean, Mr., uh...
- This.
For them, I mean.
They're kind of young.
- You were saying that they'll be exposed to this.
- Right. Uh-huh.
In what manner?
Looking at it or...
May I interject to say one thing?
"The hand that rocks the cradle rules the worid".
Is that right? Behind every great man, there's a good woman.
Now she spends, according to Reader's
Digest, about 85% with the children.
Now, whatever she is and what she imparts to them... is how those children are gonna grow up, and this is the age when they need it.
Because if your house doesn't have a foundation, you've got no kind of a house.
- Does that make sense?
- That's just... Well...
- There we are. There we are.
- That's exactly what...
And we have that in white and red.
And we can give it in any color that you might like.
And that's another thing too.
The Bible is the heritage of life.
And so, when you come right down,
I know that price is something that doesn't enter it at all.
It's the utility of it.
And believe you me,
I think you both have to agree that you have the utility there.
- Is that true or isn't it?
That's all we have to say.
- Well...
It's the way anything is designed as to what effect you... we get from it.
I just feel sorry with all your work and demonstration.
No, listen,
I was running a little stale anyway.
This is why I'm taking
Mr. Brennan out tonight...
- to see if I can sort of spark him up a little.
- He needs practice?
- He's been dropping way down.
- I really appreciate the, uh...
He used to write, if I recall, at one time...
- Paul, in your prime you were writing 12 a week, right?
- Mmm.
He dropped way down to three. He says,
"What's the matter, Mr. McDevitt?"
And I says, "Well, Paul,
I think you're a little negative.
You're negative and I think this is what you need... a little spark.
And I think somebody should take you out and spark you up... and show you how the people will acquire this".
I'm not doing this to embarrass you, Paul. Believe me.
Well, sometimes it isn't a spark.
You need an explosi髇.
With that
I think we'll say good adieu.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much now.
That's life.
Yeah, join the force and get a pensi髇.
No, siree, boss.
Mary, she works for the telephone.
She's got a lot of stocks.
They're hardworking.
Hardworking people.
Hardworking.
Yep.
Yep.
Charlie's been working in the police force now.
The boy, he retires, he gets a pensi髇.
He's all set for life.
He...
Hey, what are you doing? Slow down.
Come on. Get back, buddy!
