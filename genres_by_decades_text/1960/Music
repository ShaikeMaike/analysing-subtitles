All aboard!
Let him go, Orville.
We made it plain we don't want no more traveling salesmen in Brighton.
Credit is no good for a notions salesman.
How far you going, friend?
Wherever the people are as green as the money...
...friend.
- What's the matter with credit?
- It's old-fashioned.
You're an anvil salesman.
Your firm give credit?
- No, sir!
- Nor anybody else!
River City next station stop.
River City, lowa!
Cash for the merchandise
Cash for the buttonhooks
Cash for the cotton goods
Cash for the hard goods
Cash for the fancy goods
Cash for the soft goods
Cash for the noggins and the piggins
And the firkins
Cash for the hogshead
Cask and demijohn
Cash for the crackers
And the pickles and the flypaper
Look, whaddya talk?
Whaddya talk, whaddya talk?
Where you get it?
You can talk, you can talk
You can bicker, you can talk
You can bicker, bicker, bicker
You can talk, you can talk
You can talk, talk, talk, talk
Bicker, bicker, bicker
You can talk all you want to
But it's different than it was
No it ain't, no it ain't
But you got to know the territory
It's the Model T Ford made the trouble
Made the people want to go
Want to git, want to git
Want to git up and go
23 miles to the county seat
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
Who's gonna patronize a little bitty
2 by 4 kind of store anymore?
- Whaddya talk? Whaddya talk?
- Gone, gone
Gone with the hogshead cask
And demijohn
Gone with the sugar barrel
Pickle barrel, milk pan
Gone with the tub
And the pail and the tierce
Ever meet a fellow
By the name of Hill?
Hill?
Hill?
- Hill!
No!
Just a minute
Just a minute, just a minute
Never heard of any salesman Hill
- He doesn't know the territory
- Doesn't know the territory?
- What's the fella's line?
- Never worries about his line
Or a doggone thing
He's just a bang-beat, bell-ringing
Big haul, great go-neck-or-nothing
Rip-roaring
Every-time-a-bull's-eye salesman
That's Professor Harold Hill
Harold Hill
What's the fella's line?
What's his line?
He's a fake
And he doesn't know the territory
Look, whaddya talk, whaddya talk?
Whaddya talk, whaddya talk?
He's a music man
- He's a what?
- He's a music man
And he sells clarinets
To the kids in the town
With the big trombones
And the rat-a-tat drums
Big brass bass
Big brass bass
And the piccolo, the piccolo
With uniforms too
With a shiny gold braid on the coat
And a big red stripe running
Well, I don't know much about bands
But I do know you can't make a living
Selling big trombones
No, sir!
Mandolin picks, perhaps
And here and there a jew's-harp
No, the fella sells bands
Boys' bands
I don't know how he does it
But he lives like a king
And he dallies and he gathers
And he plucks and he shines
And when the man dances
Certainly, boys
What else?
The piper pays him
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
When the man dances
Certainly, boys
What else?
The piper pays him
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
But he doesn't know the territory!
River City!
Station stop, River City.
Just crossed the state line into lowa.
Population River City: 2212.
Cigarettes illegal in this state.
If you're all through
I'll tell you about this Harold Hill.
Say, you know Hill?
Never saw him in my life. But I just been run out of town because of Hill.
He's giving every one of us a black eye.
You go into town to call on the trade...
...and they're waiting for you with tar and feathers...
...to ride you out the city limits on a rail!
How you account for that?
It's this Hill! He goes around selling band instruments and uniforms...
...and instruction books by guaranteeing to teach the kids to play.
- Stands to reason.
- And organize them kids into a band...
...with himself as the leader.
What's wrong with that?
He don't know one note...
...from another!
- Heh-heh.
That's what's wrong!
He don't know a bass drum from a pipe organ.
He's a bare-faced, double-shuffle, two-bit thimblerigger!
And I'll catch up with him one of these days.
When I do I'll have the law on him quick!
Territory's tough enough without him fouling up the nest.
I'd like to be around when you catch up with him.
I'm not apt to catch up with him in lowa.
Not on your kidney plaster!
He's too smart to pull that flimflam out here.
Not on these neck-bowed Hawkeyes.
Gentlemen, you intrigue me.
I think I'll have to give lowa a try.
- I didn't catch your name.
- I didn't drop it.
Sir-?
Fine-looking animal.
For a horse, yeah.
Good morning. Could you kindly direct me to the center of town?
Runs right down the middle of the street.
Friend, where would I find a good hotel?
Try the Palmer House in Chicago.
I'm a stranger in town.
What do you folks do for excitement?
Mind our business.
You are in lo-way
At least now I know how to pronounce it.
I thought you preferred lo-wuh.
We do.
But he just said lo-way.
We say it now and then.
But we don't like anybody else to.
We are from lo-way
I know.
Well, you folks certainly do know how to make a body feel at home.
Oh, there's nothing halfway
About the lowa way to treat you
When we treat you
Which we may not do at all
There's an lowa kind of special
Chip-on-the-shoulder attitude
- We've never been without
- That we recall
We can be cold as
The falling thermometer in December
If you ask about our weather in July
And we're so by-God stubborn
We can stand touching noses
For a week at a time
And never see eye to eye
But what the heck
You're welcome
Join us at the picnic
- You can eat your fill
- Of all the food you bring yourself
You really ought to give lowa a try
Provided you were contrary
Good morning, Mayor Shinn.
Good morning, Mayor Shinn.
It is if you want to go around in your drawers all day.
We can be cold as
A falling thermometer in December
If you ask about our weather in July
And we're so by-God stubborn
We can stand touching noses
For a week at a time
And never see eye to eye
But we'll give you our shirt
And the back to go with it
If your crop should happen to die
So what the heck
You're welcome
Glad to have you with us
Even though we may not
Ever mention it again
You really ought to give lowa
Hawkeye lowa
Dubuque, Des Moines, Davenport
Marshalltown, Mason City
Keokuk, Ames, Clear Lake
Ought to give lowa a try
Mr. Squires. Yes.
I'm interested in a rig for Sunday.
Then you ought to see the man in charge of hiring rigs.
Rigs?
Riggs? Ain't nobody here by that name.
Marcellus!
Marcellus Washburn!
Gregory!
Of all the people to run into in lowa!
Gregory!
Shh. Hill's the name this trip.
Professor Harold Hill.
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
I didn't know I was, myself.
I never thought I'd find a slicker like you here in the sarsaparilla belt.
This is where I work.
- You mean you live in this town?
- Yeah. I like it too.
It's not Brooklyn, New York.
Not the city of homes and churches but-
Brooklyn?
Marce, this isn't even Dubuque.
Hey. Are you hiding out or what?
Just not as light on my feet as I used to be when I was shilling for you.
You're in a business that got a lot of close shaves.
I got a nice job now.
I got a nice girl.
Ethel Toffelmier.
That's the boss's niece.
So you've gone legitimate, huh?
I knew you'd come to no good.
What are you selling now?
I heard you were in steam automobiles.
- I was.
- What happened?
- Somebody actually invented one.
- No!
So now I'm back at the old stand.
Not boys' bands?
They got no call for boys' bands in this town.
Anything lowa folk don't have they do without.
They got music?
They got a gramophone down to the barber shop.
And a stuck-up librarian gives piano.
- Gives piano?
- A maiden lady.
She'll expose you before you unpack this bag.
Maiden lady librarians who give piano are a specialty of mine.
Just point her out the minute you see her.
Yeah. I'll back her into a corner and breathe on her glasses.
Thar she blows!
I'll do it but I won't like it.
That's not the librarian.
That's Mrs. Shinn, the mayor's wife.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Shinn.
Don't change the subject.
Something the matter?
The same thing is the matter as is always the matter here. Look!
Is this the sort of book you give my daughter?
This Ruby Hat of Omar Kay-ay-ay-
I am appalled!
I did recommend it.
It's beautiful Persian poetry.
It's dirty Persian poetry.
People lying out in the woods eating sandwiches.
Getting drunk with pitfall and with gin.
Drinking directly out of jugs with innocent young girls.
- No daughter of mine-
- Mrs. Shinn.
The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is a classic.
It's a smutty book, like most of the others you keep here, I daresay.
Honestly, Mrs. Shinn.
Wouldn't you rather have your daughter read a classic than Elinor Glyn?
What Elinor Glyn reads is her mother's problem.
Just you keep your dirty books away from my daughter.
You sure picked yourself a town.
Let me take you over to the hotel.
Not sure I'm going to stay yet.
First I got to find a way to get into some of these lowa boodlebags.
Greg, it ain't easy.
All I need is an opening.
You remember the pitch. What can I use?
What's new around here?
The other day a farmer brought in an egg had 3 yolks in it.
Was in the paper.
That's exciting, all right.
No, what do you talk about?
There's the weather, of course.
When it's in season.
Now, Marce, I need some ideas...
...if I'm going to get your town out of the serious trouble it's in.
River City ain't in any trouble.
We'll have to create some.
Must create a desperate need in your town for a boys' band.
Why is everyone rubbering into the billiard parlor?
They just got in a new pool table.
They must have seen one before.
No. Just billiards.
That'll do it!
Just sit where you are.
And remember...
...if you see that music teacher...
Are you Mr. Dunlop?
Either you're closing your eyes to a situation you don't wish to acknowledge...
...or you are not aware of the caliber of disaster...
...indicated by the presence of a pool table in your community.
Well, you got trouble, my friend
Right here, I say
Trouble right here in River City
Why, sure, I'm a billiard player
Certainly mighty proud to say
I'm always proud to say it
I consider that the hours I spend
With a cue in my hand are golden
Help you cultivate horse sense
And a cool head and a keen eye
You ever take and try to give
An ironclad leave to yourself
From a three-rail billiard shot?
But just as I say
It takes judgment, brains and maturity
To score in a balk-line game
I say that any boob
Can take and shove a ball in a pocket
And I call that sloth
The first big step on the road
To the depths of degrada- I say first
Medicinal wine from a teaspoon
Then beer from a bottle
The next thing you know your son is
Playing for money in a pinch-back suit
And listening to some big
Out-o'- town jasper
Hearing him tell about
Horserace gambling
Not a wholesome trotting race, no
But a race where they set down
Right on the horse!
Like to see some stuck-up jockey boy
Setting on Dan Patch?
Make your blood boil?
Well, I should say!
Now, friends
Let me tell you what I mean
You got 1, 2, 3, 4
5, 6 pockets in a table
Pockets that mark the difference
Between a gentleman and a bum
With a capital B and that
Rhymes with P and that stands for pool
And all week long your River City
Youth'll be frittering away
I say your young men'll be frittering
Frittering away their noontime
Suppertime, chore time too
Get the ball in the pocket
Never mind getting dandelions pulled
Or the screen door patched
Or the beefsteak pounded
Never mind pumping any water
Till your parents are caught
With the cistern empty on a Saturday night
And that's trouble
Yes, you got lots and lots of trouble
I'm thinking of the kids in the
Knickerbockers, shirttail young ones
Peeking in the pool hall window
After school
You got trouble, folks
Right here in River City
Trouble with a capital T and that
Rhymes with P and that stands for pool
Now I know all you folks
Are the right kind of parents
I'm going to be perfectly frank
Would you like to know what kind of
Conversation goes on
While they're loafing around that hall?
They'll be trying out Bevo
Trying out Cubebs
Trying out Tail or Mades
Like cigarette fiends
And bragging all about
How they're going to cover up
A telltale breath with Sen-Sen
One fine night they leave the pool hall
Headin' for the dance at the Armory
Libertine men and scarlet women
And ragtime
Shameless music
That'll grab your son
Your daughter, with the arms of
A jungle animal instinct mass-teria
Friends, the idle brain
Is the devil's playground, trouble!
We got trouble
- Right here in River City
With a capital T and that rhymes with P
And that stands for pool
We've surely got trouble
Right here in River City
Got to figure out a way to keep
The young ones moral after school
Our children's children
Gonna have trouble
Mothers of River City, heed that warning before it's too late.
Watch for the telltale signs of corruption.
The minute your son leaves the house...
...does he rebuckle his knickerbockers below the knee?
Is there a nicotine stain on his index finger?
A dime novel hidden in the corn crib?
Is he starting to memorize jokes from Captain Billy's Whiz Bang?
Are certain words creeping into his conversation?
Words like...
Like "swell."
And "So's your old man."
If so, my friends...
You got trouble
Right here in River City
With a capital T and that rhymes with P
And that stands for pool
We surely got trouble
Right here in River City
Remember the Maine, Plymouth Rock
And the Golden Rule
Our children's children
Gonna have trouble
Oh-ho, we got trouble
We're in terrible, terrible trouble
That game with the 15 numbered balls
Is the devil's tool
Oh, yes, we got
Trouble, trouble, trouble
- With a T
- With a capital T
Got to rhyme it with P
And that stands for pool
Remember, my friends, listen to me
Because I pass this way but once!
- Did you drop your-?
- No.
- Didn't I meet you in-?
- No.
I'll only be in town a short while.
Good!
Hello, Mama.
Keep on, Amaryllis.
I'll be there in a minute.
That's fine, dear.
Now on with your exercises.
Library open later than usual tonight, dear?
It always is, Mama.
Mama, a man with a suitcase followed me home.
Oh? Who?
I never saw him before.
Did he say anything?
He tried.
Did you say anything?
Of course not, Mama.
Now don't dawdle, Amaryllis.
So, do
La, re, ti, me
A little slower
And please keep the fingers curved
As nice and high as you possibly can
Don't get faster, dear.
It wouldn't have hurt you...
...to have found out what the gentleman wanted.
I know what the gentleman wanted.
What, dear?
You'll find it in Balzac.
Excuse me for living, but I never read it.
Neither has anyone else in this town
There you go again
With the same old comment
About the low mentality
Of River City people
And taking it all too much to heart
Now, Mama, as long as the...
Madison Public Library
Was entrusted to me
For the purpose of improving
River City's cultural level
I can't help my concern that
The ladies of River City
Keep ignoring
All my counsel and advice
But, darling!
When a woman has a husband
And you've got none
Why should she take advice from you
Even if you can quote
Balzac and Shakespeare
And all them other
Highfalutin Greeks?
If you don't mind my saying so
You have a bad habit
Of changing every subject
No, I haven't changed the subject
I was talking about that stranger
- What stranger?
- With the suitcase
Who may be your very last chance
Do you think that I'd allow
A common masher? Now really, Mama!
I have my standards
Where men are concerned
And I have no intention-
I know all about your standards
And if you don't mind my saying so
There's not a man alive
Who could hope to measure up
To that blend of Paul Bunyan,
Saint Pat and Noah Webster
You've concocted for yourself
Out of your Irish imagination
Your lowa stubbornness
And your library full of books
Well, if that isn't the best I ever heard!
Thank you.
Can I have a drink, please?
- May I-?
- May I have a drink, please?
Yes, you may.
Hello, Winthrop.
Winthrop, it's after dark, dear!
I'm having a party on Saturday.
Will you please come?
It's going to be a very nice party.
And I'd especially like it if you'd-
Amaryllis asked you to her party.
Are you going or aren't you?
- No.
- No, what?
No, thank you.
You know the little girl's name.
I'll bet he won't say it.
"No, thank you," who, Winthrop?
No, thank you, Amaryllith!
"Amaryllith"!
He's crying!
Hello, Winthrop.
Winthrop, you didn't even say hello to your sister.
He hates to say Amaryllis because of the lisp.
He's ashamed.
We know all about his lisp, Amaryllis.
Why should he get so mad at people?
Just because he lisps?
- That's just part of it.
- What's the rest of it?
Never mind, dear. It's just that he never talks very much.
Not even to you and your mother?
No, but we have to be very patient and understanding.
I'm patient.
I even say good night to him on the evening star.
Every night.
Good night, my Winthrop.
Good night.
Sleep tight.
And he never says anything to me.
Oh, darling, don't cry.
You'll have lots of time for sweethearts.
If not Winthrop, there'll be someone else.
Never! I'll end up an old maid like you.
I'm sorry, Miss Marian.
Can I play my cross-hand piece?
- May I-?
- May I play my cross-hand piece?
Yes, you may.
If a girl doesn't have a sweetheart...
...who's she going to say good night to on the evening star?
For the time being, you can just say:
"Good night...
...my someone."
You can put the name in when the right someone comes along.
All right. It's better than nothing.
Yes, it is.
Now you can play your cross-hand piece.
Good night, my someone
Good night, my love
Sleep tight, my someone
Sleep tight, my love
Our star is shining
Its brightest light
For good night, my love
For good night
Sweet dreams be yours, dear
If dreams there be
Sweet dreams
To carry you
Close to me
I wish they may
And I wish they might
Now good night, my someone
Good night
True love can be whispered
From heart to heart
When lovers are parted, they say
But I must depend
On a wish and a star
As long as my heart
Doesn't know who you are
Sweet dreams be yours, dear
If dreams there be
Sweet dreams
To carry you close to me
I wish they may
And I wish they might
Now good night, my someone
Good night
Good night
Good night
O Columbia
The gem of the ocean
The home of the brave and the free
The shrine of each patriot's devotion
A world offers homage to thee
Thy mandates make heroes assemble
When liberty's form stands in view
Thy banners make tyranny tremble
When borne by the red, white and blue
When borne by the red, white and blue
When borne by the red, white and blue
Thy banners make tyranny tremble
When borne by the red, white and blue
I'm sure we're all grateful to my wife...
...Eulalie Mackecknie Shinn, for leading the singing.
And to Ethel Toffelmier...
...our fine player piano player...
...piano.
As mayor of River City...
...I welcome you River Citi-zeeans...
...to the Fourth of July exercises set up indoors here in Madison Gymnasium...
...account the weather being so chancy.
Fourscore-
Fourscore-
Ah.
The members of the school board will now present a patriotic tableau.
Oh. Oh. The members of the school board will not present a patriotic tableau.
Oh.
Some disagreement about costumes,
I suppose.
Instead the Wa Tan Ye girls...
...of the local wigwam of Hiawatha...
...will present a spectacle. My wife.
In which my wife, Eulalie Mackecknie
Shinn, will take a leading part.
I will now count to 20 in the Indian tongue.
Ah! I'm shot! Ho-ho!
Who set off that firecracker?
Tommy Djilas did it. Tommy did it!
Yes, Tommy Djilas.
Tommy Djilas, I wouldn't leave if I were you.
Mrs. Shinn...
...will recover.
No thanks to a certain young ruffian who is a disgrace to our city.
Fourscore...
...and seven years ago our-
The Paine's Fireworks Spectacle,
"Last Days of Pomp-ee-eye"...
...will take place at 9: 30, providing it isn't raining.
It'll be over at the Madison Picnic Park in the far meadow.
- Across the creek from the pest house.
- What's all this talk about rain?
The Gazette predicted fair!
That's why we prepared for a storm.
My paper's accurate most of the time, Jacey.
I wouldn't last long in the banking business...
...being accurate most of the time.
Will members of the school board stop bickering in public?
Never mind!
Fourscore-
- We heard there's a pool table in town!
- That's what I heard.
Just a minute!
- Is it a pool table or isn't it?
Allow me to get on with the exercises.
We don't want any more exercises until we get this pool table matter settled.
Let's protect our children!
We've got to protect our children!
Resist sin and corruption!
Resist sin and corruption!
Let's smite that devil and keep our young boys pure!
Pure boys!
Folks, listen.
May I have your attention, please?
Attention, please.
I can deal with the trouble, friends
With a wave of my hand, this very hand!
Please observe me if you will
I'm Professor Harold Hill
And I'm here to organize
The River City Boys Band
Oh, think, my friends
How can any pool table
Ever hope to compete
With a gold trombone?
Remember, my friends
What a handful of trumpet players
Did to the famous
Fabled walls of Jericho
Oh billiard parlor walls
Come a-tumbling down
Well, a band'll do it, my friends
Oh, yes, I said a boys' band.
Do you hear me?
I said River City got
To have a boys' band
And I mean she needs it today
Well, Professor Harold Hill's on hand
River City's going to have her boys' band
As sure as the Lord made little green apples.
And that band's going to be in uniform:
Johnny, Willy, Teddy, Fred!
You'll see the glitter of crashing cymbals...
...and hear the thunder of rolling drums and the shimmer of trumpets. Tam-tada!
And you'll feel something akin to the electric thrill I once enjoyed...
...when Gilmore...
...Pat Conway, the great Creatore...
...W. C. Handy...
...and John Philip Sousa...
...all came to town on the very same historic day!
76 trombones led the big parade
With 110 cornets close at hand
They were followed by rows and rows
Of the finest virtuosos
The cream of every famous band
76 trombones caught the morning sun
With 110 cornets right behind
There were more than a thousand reeds
Springing up like weeds
There were horns
Of every shape and kind
There were copper-bottom timpani
In horse platoons
Thundering, thundering
All along the way
Double bell euphoniums
And big bassoons
Each bassoon
Having his big fat say
There were 50 mounted cannon
In the battery
Thundering, thundering
Louder than before
Clarinets of every size
And trumpeters who'd improvise
A full octave higher than the score
Whoo!
76 trombones hit the counterpoint
While 110 cornets blazed away
To the rhythm of Hark! Hark! Hark!
All the kids began to march
And they're marching still right today
There ain't nothing like a brass band to stir a fella up.
When I hear them trombones...
It's them peck horns that really does it.
I bet you Estherville ain't got anything like it.
Or even Des Moines.
I'll stake my River City band against any town west of Chicago.
What band?
Honestly! A bunch of grown men.
Along comes this fly-by-night salesman and you're all taken in.
She's right.
The man's a by-God spellbinder!
I haven't seen people so excited since
Frank Gotch and Strangler Lewis...
...lay on the mat for three and a half hours without moving a muscle.
Oh, but that was exciting!
Never mind!
Men, this calls for emergency action.
I want that man's credentials.
Grab that hoodlum!
He almost blew up Mrs. Shinn.
Great honk! Let me go!
Much obliged.
Have to make an example of this one.
Everything the ringleader does the gang does.
You wild kid, you!
Hanging around my oldest girl.
His father is one of them Nithelanians.
- You wild kid, you!
- What'd I do?
- Tagging after my oldest girl.
- I wasn't either tagging.
Don't contradict me!
We was just walking together.
Great honk!
Watch your phraseology. I know what you was doing. Little Grade seen you.
Stay away from my oldest or you'll hear from me till who-laid-the-rails.
I'll talk to you Monday morning about this band thing. Here in City Hall.
Ten o'clock sharp.
Now, constable!
I'll be responsible for him.
This kid's tough. Probably got his gang waiting around the corner.
I'll be careful.
Tommy, I want to talk to you about the band.
Gee, professor, that's for the little kids.
No, not about playing in the band.
Aren't you mechanically minded?
Did you ever do anything with...
...perpetual motion?
Yeah. I nearly had it a couple times.
You did? Well, you're my man.
Do you realize no one has ever invented a music holder...
...for a marching piccolo player?
There's no place to hang the music.
Great honk! Where can I get wire?
Look in your cellar.
That's where people keep wire.
Oh, Tommy.
Yes, sir?
Constable, I'll show you how to break up a gang.
Young lady!
Miss, what's your name?
Zaneeta.
I didn't have any idea you was beckoning to me. Ye gods!
- Do you know Tommy Djilas?
- Well-
Now, Tommy, this is Zaneeta.
Escort the young lady home.
Only I'm not going home.
I have to go to the library.
Ye gods!
Then escort the young lady home by way of the library, uh-huh...
...by way of the Candy Kitchen.
Yes, sir.
Do I have to?
Oh, you have to.
Yes, sir!
Ye gods!
Professor.
You're a bright young fella, only you made a couple mistakes.
- Oh?
- The mayor owns that billiard parlor...
...and that new pool table.
You don't say?
What was my other mistake?
That Zaneeta.
She's the mayor's oldest girl.
Good evening, ladies.
Just a minute, Professor Hill.
Sorry, we're the school board and we need your credentials.
- Academic certificates.
- Nothing of the kind!
We need letters and papers.
Make him put up a bond.
What am I hearing?
You, sir.
Say "ice cream"
- Ice cream. But I don't sing-
- Talk, then.
Down here
Ice cream
Ice cream.
Talk slow
Ice cream
You see? Singing is just...
Sustained talking
Now you, sir.
Ice cream
Now you, sir.
Now you, sir!
Ice cream
From now on you won't see one of those men without the other three.
Professor, you're wrong.
Why, they've hated each other for 15 years.
Ice cream

Go ahead, Mom.
I'll be there in a minute.
How can there be
Any sin in sincere?
Where is the good in goodbye?
Your apprehensions confuse me, dear.
Puzzle and mystify
Tell me
What can be fair
In farewell, dear?
Why one single star shines above?
How can there be any sin in
Sincere?
Aren't we sincerely
In love?
- I don't suppose you live alone or anything-
- No.
- I have wonderful caramels at the hotel-
- Mr. Hill.
Oh, please, please!
Professor Hill.
Professor? Of what?
What college gives a degree for accosting women...
...like a rowdy at a public dance hall?
I wouldn't know.
I'm a Conservatory man.
Gary, Indiana.
Gold Medal class of '05.
Even should that happen to be true, Mr. Hill...
...I am not as easily mesmerized as some people in town.
It's only fair to tell you
I'm not impressed by your credentials...
...which I've not seen, nor your manners, which I have!
It's a golden key, as it were.
Your key to the magic world of music.
None of our family's ever been what you'd call musical.
Madam, that you do not know.
Now the main thing is imagination and proper instruction. Ah!
You, young man, repeat after me.
I love music, Mommy
I love music, Mommy
Now you, young man.
Me too, Mommy
Me too, Mommy
Madam, it's amazing!
Two members of the same family with absolutely perfect pitch.
Sign here, madam.
You sure cut a swath down at the high school yesterday.
- Yeah.
- When you talked about them trombones...
...you looked just like you used to back in Joplin.
Joplin?
Yeah, when you used to imitate that
Italian bandleader in the park.
Oh, yeah.
Ra ta ta ta ta ta
Ram ta ra ta ram
That's kid stuff.
I'm in rare form these days, son.
Just keep your eye on me for the next four weeks.
Four weeks? You used to get the instruments in 10 days.
I still do, but it takes four weeks for the uniforms.
Uniforms? You've added uniforms?
Uniforms and instruction books.
Why warm up if you're not going to pitch?
You can't pass yourself off as a music professor. You can't read music.
I have a revolutionary new method, the Think System.
You don't bother with notes.
My boy...
...someday reading music is going to be absolutely obsolete.
I hope it's soon. In four weeks these people will want to hear music.
But when the uniforms arrive they forget everything else.
At least long enough for me to collect and leave.
This is a refined operation, son.
I've got it timed down to the wave of the brakeman's hand...
...on the last train out of town.
- Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening, ladies.
Good evening, ladies.
Oh.
Professor Hill...
...we're all agog.
Oh, yes, simply agog!
- On the qui vive.
- Everyone's excited about the band.
I'm Ethel Toffelmier, the pianola girl.
And this is Avis Grubb.
- How do you do?
- And Mrs. Hicks.
- Hello.
- And Mrs. Squires.
And, of course, you've met
Eulalie Mackecknie Shinn.
- Our mayor's wife.
- Yes, indeed.
Oh, yes.
Isn't it exciting, Eulalie?
I couldn't say.
Oh, no, I could not say.
I could not say at this time.
My husband will wish to investigate,
I'm sure.
And naturally I'm reticent.
Oh, yes. I'm reticent.
Yes, of course.
I understand, Mrs. Shinn.
But part of my music plans include a committee on the dance.
And I was thinking-
Do that again, Mrs. Shinn.
Do what? What did I do?
Your foot, the way you just raised it.
Oh, well, I have a bunion there that bothers me.
What grace!
Oh, Mr. Hill.
What natural flow of rhythm!
Oh, Mr. Hill.
What expression of line and movement!
You must accept chairmanship...
...of the ladies' auxiliary for the classic dance. Mustn't she, ladies?
Mrs. Shinn, your every move bespeaks Delsarte.
Will you? Will you?
Say yes, Mrs. Shinn.
Well, I-
That is-
Dancing? Well!
Then you accept?
Indeed! And I'd like to say-
Thank you, Mrs. Shinn.
Oh...
Now, the young lady who teaches the piano.
Marian Paroo, I believe.
Oh!
After all, she is the librarian.
She must've picked him out the first crack out of the box.
Talking up to a man like that.
He wouldn't talk about her if she didn't try turkey-talking to him.
Ought to take her ticket and punch it for her.
Picked her out first crack like a cheap jack.
Not much pick to her.
- Pick a little, talk a lot.
- Pick a little, talk a little.
- Cheep, cheep, cheep.
- Talk a lot, pick a little more.
Pick a little, talk a little
Cheep, cheep, cheep
Talk a lot pick, a little more.
Pick a little, talk a little
Pick a little, talk a little
Talk a lot, pick a little more
Her kind of woman doesn't belong on any committee.
Of course, I shouldn't tell you this, but she advocates dirty books.
- Dirty books?
- Chaucer.
Rabelais.
Balzac!
The worst thing-
I shouldn't tell you this-
- I'll tell.
- The man lived on my street.
- Let me tell.
- No, I'll tell.
She made brazen overtures to a man who never had a friend...
...till she came here.
- Old miser Madison.
- Miser Madison?
- Miser-
- Madison.
Madison Picnic Park? Madison Gymnasium?
Madison Hospital? That miser Madison?
Exactly! Who did he think he was, anyway?
I should say!
The showoff!
He gave the town the library too.
That's just it. When he died he left the library to the city.
But he left all the books to her.
She was seen going and coming from his place.
Oh, yes! That woman made...
Brazen overtures
With a gild-edge guarantee
She had a golden glint in her eye
And a silver voice
With a counterfeit ring
Just melt her down and you'll reveal
A lump of lead as cold as steel here
Where woman's heart should be!
He left River City
The library building
But he left all the books to her
Chaucer.
Rabelais.
Balzac!
Just a minute here, professor.
Sorry. We need your credentials.
Certainly, gentlemen. I have just what you want over at my hotel.
Please come with me.
Good night, ladies!
Good night, ladies
Good night, ladies
Good night, ladies
We're going to leave you now
Farewell, ladies
Farewell, ladies
Farewell, ladies
We're going
To leave you now
Can I visit the horses?
- "May l"?
- May I visit the horses?
It's not visiting hours, but all right.
What a beautiful evening.
Not bad at all for a little place like River City, lowa.
Come to the boarding house.
We got chicken croquettes tonight.
No, I'm not thinking about food.
Going to line yourself up a little canoodling?
No, I got something to look up at the library.
From what I've heard...
Let me fix you up with
Myrtle Toffelmier, Ethel's sister.
Real nice girl.
Teaches Sunday school.
No wide-eyed, eager, wholesome, innocent Sunday school teacher for me.
That kind of gal spins webs no spider ever- Listen, boy.
A gal who trades on all that purity
Merely wants to trade
My independence for her security
The only affirmative she will file
Refers to marching down the aisle
No golden glorious gleaming
Pristine goddess
No, sir
For no Diana do I play faun
I can tell you that right now
I snarl, I hiss
How can ignorance be compared to bliss?
I spark, I fizz
For the lady who knows what time it is
I cheer and I rave
For the virtue I'm too late to save
The sadder but wiser girl for me
No bright-eyed blushing breathless
Baby-doll baby
No, sir
That kind of child ties knots
No sailor ever knew
I prefer to take a chance
On a more adult romance
No dewy young miss who keeps resisting
All the time she keeps insisting
No wide-eyed wholesome innocent female
No, sir!
Why, she's the fisherman
I'm the fish, you see
I flinch, I shy
When the lass with
The delicate air goes by
I smile, I grin
When the gal with a touch of sin
Walks in
I hope and I pray
For a Hester to win just one more "A"
The sadder but wiser girl's
The girl for me
The sadder but wiser girl for me
It's all right.
I know everything and it makes no difference.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Mr. Madison.
You were probably very young.
Anyone can make a mistake.
What?
No apologies. No explanations.
You see, I'll only be in town a short while...
...and the sadder but wiser girl for me.
Would you please make your selection and leave?
I have.
- What do you want to take out?
- The librarian.
Shh.
Quiet, please.
The librarian.
You're not listening, Marian.
Look.
Marian
Marbles.
Six steelies, eight aggies, a dozen peewees...
...and one big glassie with an American flag in the middle.
- I think I'll drop them.
- No!
Shh.
Madam librarian
Oh, what can I do, my dear
To catch your ear?
I love you madly, madly
Madam Librarian
Marian
Heaven help us
If the library caught on fire
And the volunteer hose-brigade men
Had to whisper the news to
Marian
Madam librarian
Oh, what can I say, my dear
To make it clear?
I need you badly, badly
Madam Librarian
Marian
If I stumbled and I busted
My whatchamacallit
I could lie on your floor unnoticed
Till my body had turned to
Carrion
Madam librarian
Now in the moonlight
A man could sing it
In the moonlight
And a fellow would know
That his darling
Had heard every word of his song
With the moonlight
Helping along
But when I try in here
To tell you, dear
I love you madly, madly
Madam Librarian
Marian
It's a long-lost cause
I can never win
For the civilized world accepts
As unforgivable sin
Any talking out loud
With any librarian
Such as Marian
Madam librarian
Tommy!
Shh.
But when I try in here
To tell you, dear
I love you madly, madly
Madam Librarian
Marian
It's a long-lost cause
I can never win
For the civilized world accepts
As unforgivable sin
Any talking out loud
With any librarian
Such as
Ladies Dance Committee meets Tuesday night.
Marian
Marshmallow?
Madam librarian
- Hey, professor.
- Hello, Tommy.
- I think I got it.
- Yeah?
My music holder for a marching piccolo player.
- Oh.
- I still haven't worked out...
...a couple of minor flaws.
Even Edison doesn't always get it right the first time.
When you hold it tight enough to keep the music steady...
...you cut off the circulation and you can't wiggle your fingers.
And meanwhile...
...you could go blind.
I'd say it still needs a little work.
Like to check out a few prospects with me?
Hey.
You mean you're going in there?
I don't see any quarantine sign.
Gee, I got to hand it to you, professor.
See you later.
I hope.
Just a minute here.
Are you soliciting?
You haven't got a license.
Why, no, Mr. Mayor.
Mr. Mayor, I collect doorbells.
And this specimen has an unusual tone quality-
Flattery will not avail you.
Soliciting is statutory in this county.
Malfeasance without a permit.
Why haven't you been over at City Hall?
- I must have just missed you.
- None of your alibis!
- Your hand. Isn't that amazing?
- Hmm?
What? What?
That spread of the little finger.
It's hereditary.
- It is? What does that mean?
- Mm.
It means your son's little finger...
...is perfectly situated for the spit valve on a flugelhorn.
- Is that good?
- Good?
It means America finally has an artist who can...
...flugel the "Minute Waltz" in 50 seconds.
- How can I get one of those horns?
- Sign here.
Yes, sir.
Fine, fine!
That'll be 17 dollars import fee.
Just think, I could've missed this whole thing.
My son could've-
I haven't got any son!
Oh, George.
I never had a son.
- I never said you did.
- What do you know?
I'd certainly know if I gave you a son.
- I'm not talking to you.
- Who are you talking to?
- Him.
- Who?
Never mind!
Zaneeta, call Dr. Pyne for your father.
Yes, my dear Mrs. Paroo, you must realize...
...that only one out of every 78 adults...
...has a ganglion that reaches the ligature clear down to the apex.
This automatically turns your entire face into an amazing embouchure.
I never had a sick day in my life, doctor.
Ah. Professor.
Professor! What shall I do for it?
No, you don't understand.
I'm trying to tell you, you have the facial characteristics...
...of a cornet virtuoso.
If your boy has that same firm chin...
...and those splendid cheek muscles, oh-ho-ho...
By George!
Not that he'd ever really be great.
Is that so?
And in the name of
St. Bridget, why not?
All of the really great cornet players were Irish.
O'Clark, O'Mendez, O'Klein...
But, professor, we are Irish.
No!
No, really? That clinches it.
Sign here, Madam.
Your boy was born to play the cornet.
Fine, fine!
That'll be 7 dollars earnest money.
Nothing more due until the opening of band practice.
Thank you. And I'll need your boy's measurements for his uniform.
His uniform?
- Oh, yes-
- Ah!
- Winthrop!
- Well, hello there, son.
Why, certainly, his uniform.
And there won't be a penny due until delivery.
Which gives him four weeks to enjoy, anticipate, imagine at no cost.
Never allow the demands of tomorrow...
...to interfere with the pleasures and excitements of today.
Would it have a-?
- A...
- A...
A stripe! Why, certainly, my boy!
A wide, red stripe down each side.
What do you think of that?
You'll have to excuse Winthrop.
We can't get him to say three words a day.
Not even to us.
If you can get him to play in that band...
...you'll have St. Michael's own way with you.
But if anybody can do it,
I bet you can. Heh-heh.
Thank you.
You've a gift of the blarney about you, no mistaking that.
- Where are you from, my boy?
- Gary, Indiana.
I knew it!
Where'd you say?
Gary, Indiana.
Gary Conservatory was my alma mater.
Was she now?
Yes, indeed.
Gold Medal Class of '05.
Gary, Indiana
What a wonderful name!
Named for Elbert Gary
Of judiciary fame
Gary, Indiana
As a Shakespeare would say
Trips along softly
On the tongue this way
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
Let me say it once again
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
That's the town that knew me when
Now if you'd like to have
A logical explanation
How I happened on
This elegant syncopation
I will say without
A moment of hesitation
There is just one place
That can light my face
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
Not Louisiana
Paris, France
New York or Rome
But Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
My home sweet home
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
My home sweet home
- Ah!
- Whoa!
Mama!
How do you do, Miss Paroo?
How do you do?
Of course, Paroo!
I thought the name sounded familiar.
- I've been trying to see you.
- He wants to put Winthrop in the band.
We're not interested.
But Marian dear, the boy might have his father's musical gift.
He does have my ganglion, you know.
Your husband is musical?
I'd like to talk to him.
Do you always burst into people's homes prying into personal affairs?
We're not interested.
Marian!
There's one for and one against.
Now, why not let the boy's father decide?
The boy's father is dead.
Anything else?
I am sorry.
But all the more reason he should have this!
My brother is an unhappy child who can't understand why his father was taken away.
Would you care to explain it to him?
He's been brooding for two years.
And as for your musical tricks, go into business with a carnival man...
...who sells painted watches and glass diamond rings!
Musical tricks? Now, Miss Paroo!
I have a feeling she likes the idea.
A little cautious, but I admire that in a woman.
I'll be back later in the week.
I do hope you'll excuse Marian.
She's not really-
Please, don't you worry about a thing.
I'm sure that at heart, she's as lovely as yourself.
Good day to you, Widow Paroo.
- Has he gone?
- He has. And I hope not forever.
Darling, don't you ever think of your future?
Now, Mama, a girl's future doesn't depend on encouraging...
...every fast-talking, self-centered...
...woman-chasing traveling man who comes to town.
All right, darling. All right.
Only it's a well-known principle that if you keep the flint in one drawer...
...and the steel in the other you'll never strike a fire.
- Mama!
- A fine-looking man.
And educated.
Gary, Indiana Conservation class of 'Aught-five.
That he claims his commodity is music does not, in this case, impress me.
Nor does anything else about him.
I give up.
At your age, if you don't mind my asking, what are you waiting for?
Not for Ed Griner, who backs me into the history shelf...
...every time he's in the library.
He does?
Or Ed Gammage who has the buggy with the removable back seat.
If you're waiting for a knight in shining white armor to come riding up the street...
I'm not waiting for that either.
Then what are you waiting for?
Marian Paroo, if you don't mind my asking...
...don't you ever think about being in love?
Being in love?
Being in love
Used to be my favorite dream
Oh, yes
I've been in love
More than anybody else has
I guess
My first love
Heroically ran the streetcar
I tingled at every clang-clang
Next I fell for the principal
But, oh, that teacher who sang
"In the Gloaming"
Knee-deep in love
What a lovely dream
And yet somehow
Me deep in love's
Only half of what
I'm longing for now
I still love my being
In love with someone
But tell me why couldn't there be
Somebody being in love
With me?
All I want is a plain man
All I want is a modest man
A quiet man
A gentle man
A straightforward and honest man
To sit with me
In a cottage somewhere
In the state of lowa
And I would like him to be
More interested in me
Than he is in himself
And more interested in us
Than in me
And if occasionally he'd ponder
What makes Shakespeare
And Beethoven great
Him I could love till I die
Him I could love
Till I die
Being in love
What a lovely dream
And yet
Somehow
Being in love's
Only half of what
I'm longing for now
And so then
Tonight I'll be in there dreaming
And hoping that someday there'll be
Just once!
Somebody being in love
With me
Please, Zaneeta.
I'm supposed to be parallel reading.
Just to the Candy Kitchen.
With Mama and Papa shopping on Center Street?
Ye gods!
Meet me after supper.
I can't. It's Epworth League tonight.
- Meet you where?
- The footbridge.
See? Isn't that what I said?
Last time the lumberyard, now the footbridge.
Where will we meet after that?
The black hole of Calcutta? Ye gods!
Shh.
It's indecent to meet boys at the footbridge.
First thing after supper?
All right.
- Ye gods!
- Shh.
The Wells Fargo wagon!
The Wells Fargo wagon?
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming down the street
Oh, please let it be for me
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming down the street
I wish, I wish I knew what it could be
I got a box of maple sugar
On my birthday
In March I got a gray mackinaw
And once I got some grapefruit
From Tampa
Montgomery Ward sent me a bathtub
And a crosscut saw
- Is that the first thing I said or not?
- Yes, George.
Yes, the very first thing I said, or I'll eat hay with the horse.
Get his credentials, I said...
...morning of July 4th...
...19 and 12.
Now look! My wife is off dancing at any and all hours...
...instead of in the home.
And the school board is singing instead of tending to city matters.
My oldest girl is boodling around with some wild kid.
And my business's fell off so far
I can't find the balance sheet.
I found something interesting in this book about Professor Hill's alma mater.
I know all about it.
It's all I can get out of him.
Gary Conservatory, class of '05.
If you take time to read it, you wouldn't have to look any further.
It's on page-
Papa, the Wells Fargo wagon is coming this way.
The Wells Fargo wagon?
It could be the band instruments!
- The band instruments?
- But Mayor Shinn!
Later, later.
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming now
Is it the prepaid surprise or C. O. D.?
It could be curtains
- Or dishes
- Or a double boiler
- Or it could be
Yes, it could be
Yes, you're right
It surely could be
- Something special
Something very, very special now
Just for me
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming down the street
Oh, don't let him pass my door
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming down the street
I wish I knew what he was coming for
I got some salmon from Seattle
Last September
And I expect a new rocking chair
I hope I get my raisins from Fresno
The D. A. R. Have sent a cannon
For the courthouse square
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming now
I don't know how I can ever
Wait to see
It could be something
For thomeone who is
No relation
But it could be
Something special
Just for me
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Don't you dare to make a stop
Until you stop
For me
Here you are, Winthrop.
My cornet!
Gee, thanks, professor.
Isn't this the most scrumptious solid gold thing you ever saw?
I never thought I'd ever see anything...
...so scrumptious as this solid gold thing. Oh, sister!
Remember, men!
Stay off the streets...
...pay attention to your instruments, and think about the "Minuet in G."

Yes.
And now, Miss Marian, about that book-
George, come along.
Tern pus fug it.
You watch your phraseology!
Go along, if you want. I must get something from the librarian.
About that book...

Now for our Grecian urns.

Two Grecian urns!

And a fountain.
Trickle, trickle, trickle, trickle, trickle, trickle.
Splendid, ladies! Splendid!
Our Delsarte display will be...

Oh.
Now once again.
Practice makes perfection...

Then remember, men:
If you want to play the "Minuet in G"...
...think the "Minuet in G."
A meeting of two minds, yours and Beethoven's.
- All together now.
- Professor.
I can't even think out how to hold the horn right.
There's these little spigots on the side...
...but which one's which?
Aha-ha. Experimentation!
Trial and error!
- Could you show me, professor?
- Oh.
I'll tell you what the great Giuseppe Creatore...
...said to me once under like circumstances.
"Professor Hill," he said,
"that is your instrument.
Hold onto it.
Cherish it.
Don't let anybody else play it.
Not even me.
Not even you.
Until you feel you're ready."
- But-
- Ah-ah-ah-ah.
Yes, sir.
All together now.

Ye gods!
Great honk!
If there's anything you don't see there, ask for it.
Oh. Professor Hill, I didn't see you.
May I join you?
Well, really, I-
Where? They were seen!
Red-handed! Caught in the act!
- Take your hands off my daughter!
- Papa!
Mr. Shinn, Your Honor, your daughter and I are going steady behind your back.
- Why, you-!
- We'd rather do it in front of your back.
Do what?
- Well, uh-
- Never mind!
Zaneeta's scared of you but I'm not.
I should think you'd hate to have your daughter scared of you. Great honk!
I'll warn you once more:
If you ever touch my daughter...
...I'll horsewhip you till hell won't have it!
Now, George!
Not one poop out of you, Madam.
I think he means "peep."
Yeah.
Now get out of this public emporium!
I got as much right in a public emporium as anybody!
How do you get any right around here?
Aiding and abetting the swindling activities of this cymbal salesman!
You know what I see written all over you? Reform school!
Now get out!
Get out, you wild kid!
Papa, please!
It's Capulets like you make blood in the marketplace. Ye gods!
You watch your phraseology, young woman!
Go home.
Taking up with wild kids from the wrong side of town!
If I could make you understand-
Well, you can't!
And thanks for the buggy ride.
I read that book you gave me from cover to cover...
...and didn't find a thing.
Mr. Mayor, please-
I'll settle your hash...
...as soon as I get these premises off my oldest girl.
- Yes.
- But in the meantime...
...I'm vouching for Tommy Djilas.
He has the confidence of every kid in town.
You'll be waiting to shake his hand...
...when our band plays its first concert.
By that time, my fine young feathered...
...my feathered young, my feathered fine-
Never mind!
Oliver! Jacey! Ewart! Olin!
I want that man's references and I want them tonight.
He's slipperier than a Mississippi... sturgeon.
I think Mayor Shinn behaved abominably.
And it was wonderful of you, sticking up for Tommy Djilas.
- Oh, that was nothing.
- Yes, it was.
A man can't go back on his principles because personal risk is involved.

A brave man...
...only 500.
- Something like that.
- Thank you.
Get his papers or get him in jail!
I couldn't make myself clearer...
...if I was a buttonhook in well water.
I want to talk to you about Winthrop's cornet.
A beautiful instrument.
Hammered brass, mother-of-pearl keys.
But he never touches it. He said you told him it wasn't necessary.
You must understand-
Something about a "Think System."
He says if he thinks the "Minuet in G" he can play it.
I admit it's still in the experimental stages.
To a seasoned professional like yourself it may seem ludicrous.
You mustn't say that.
- I mustn't?
- No.
Throughout history the true originator is always laughed at.
I hope you don't class me with those small minds who ridiculed-
- Galileo.
- Yes, and his conception of the heavens.
Or Fulton.
- Yes. Or Columbus.
- And his conception of the egg-
Globe!
The one thing one must remember, no matter who one is...
...or what one is working for...
...one can do anything if one puts one's mind to it.
Miss Marian...
...if one could only tell you how much you've done for one.
I would deem it a great privilege to talk with you again.
Well, all I said-
May one call upon you some evening?
Any night this week.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Sorry, professor, but we got our orders.
We all been deputized.
Yes, yes, yes.
Congratulations. Now let me see.
Every time I try to give you those credentials...
...you always try to change the subject somehow.
It's like a conspiracy.
I'll go up in my room and get them.
- Sorry! Afraid I'll have to go with you.
- Oh, yes.
Let's see if I have my key.
What's this?
What do you know?
A testimonial from the only female bassoonist...
...on the Redpath Circuit.
Madame Rini.
That's her stage name.
Actually she's from Moline.
- Lida Rose Quackenbush.
- Can I see that?
You never forget the name.
Lida Rose.
- Just like in the old song.
- None of that now!
Lida Rose
I'm home again, Rose
To get the
Sun back
In the sky
Lida Rose
I'm home again, Rose
About a thousand kisses shy
Ding
Dong
Ding
I can hear the chapel bell chime
Ding
Dong
Ding
At the least suggestion
I'll pop the question
Lida Rose
I'm home again, Rose
Without a sweetheart to my name
Lida Rose
How everyone knows
That I am hoping you're the same
So here is my love song
Not fancy or fine
Lida Rose
Oh, won't you be mine?
Lida Rose, oh, Lida Rose
Oh, Lida Rose
Dream of now
Dream of then
Dream of a love song
That might have been
Do I love you?
Oh, yes, I love you
And I'll bravely tell you
But only when you dream again
Sweet and low
Sweet and low
How sweet that memory
How long ago?
Forever?
Oh, yes, forever
Will I ever tell you?
No
Lida Rose, oh, Lida Rose, oh
Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose
To get the sun back in the sky
Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose
About a thousand kisses shy
Ding
Dong
Ding
I can hear the chapel bell chime
Ding
Dong
Ding
At the least suggestion
I'll pop the question
Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose
Without a sweetheart to my name
Lida Rose, how everyone knows
That I am hoping you're the same
So here is my love song
Not fancy or fine
Lida Rose, oh, won't you be mine?
Lida Rose, oh, Lida Rose
Oh, Lida Rose
Will you ever stop arguing with yourself?
Will you ever tell him?
Won't you ever tell him? Yes! No!
Fiddlesticks! Open your mouth and let it come out.
- Now, Mama-
- Now, nothing.
If he ever calls again, you see him alone...
...and if you haven't the gumption to tell him how you feel-
Tell him?
- Nothing wrong with a ladylike hint.
Ah! What's that thing you got?
It's a genuine Hercules combination pocketknife and tool kit...
...with a solid stag handle and six sturdy steel blades.
Blessed Martin of Tours!
One spear blade, one sheep's foot blade, one small pen blade...
...a swagging awl, a file and a combination tack puller and screwdriver.
Where'd you pick up that horrible weapon?
It was a present.
From Harold.
- Professor Hill?
- Uh-huh.
He says if I stick around River City...
...I better learn to whittle and spit.
I got the spitting down pretty good.
Winthrop, what do you and Harold find to talk about?
Sometimes we talk business and sometimes just plain talk.
He talks about his hometown,
Gary, Indiana.
He said he'd take me there someday.
Isn't that nice?
He taught me a song about it with hardly any "S"s in it.
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
Let me say it once again
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
That's the town that knew me when
If you'd like to have
A logical explanation
How I happened on this
Elegant syncopation
I will say without
A moment of hesitation
There is just one place
That can light my face
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
Not Louisiana
Paris, France
New York or Rome
- But-
- Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
Gary, Indiana
My home sweet home
All right, enough of that.
Come along, now.
You still have to change for the sociable.
Do the Shinns live around here somewhere?
The Shinn home is on East Elm.
This is West Elm.
Mm, criminy.
Oh. I see you're the piano teacher here in town.
You must know about this fellow Hill forming a boys' band here.
Don't let that worry you no more.
I got the goods on him in spades.
That swindling, two-bit thimblerigger!
That's why I got to see Shinn.
I'm just passing through...
...and number 8 only makes a 15-minute water stop and-
Ooh.
I wish it was 20.
Sure could concentrate five minutes on you, girlie-girl.
Who are you?
Name's Charlie Cowell.
Anvil salesman.
But now I've got heavier things on my mind.
I've got to protect the good name of the traveling fraternity from Hill.
Mr. Cowell, you're making a big mistake.
Mistake, my old lady's corset cover!
He's been the raspberry seed...
...in my wisdom tooth just long enough.
He spoiled Illinois for me.
But he won't spoil lowa.
You're a music teacher.
You didn't see through him?
- He's no more professor-
- I know all about that.
Bandleaders are always called professor.
It's an academic courtesy.
He's a fine director-
Now wait a minute!
Fine director?
Tell me, you heard one note of music from any band?
Well, no, but-
But nothing, girlie-girl.
He never formed a band in his life.
And you think he ever will?
Not on your previous existence!
Just listen a minute-
I'd like to.
I'd like to do more than that if I had the time.
Sure got the inclination.
But I got to leave this dynamite with somebody on the way to the depot.
Bye, girlie-girl. I'll see you next time I come through.
You'll never make that train at the depot. Catch it at the crossing.
I've got to leave word, and I can see you ain't the one to leave it with.
Wait a minute!
Mr. Cowell.
You don't know me very well yet.
Is that an invitation, girlie-girl?
No. I mean, I don't know you.
I'd need more time anyway.
What I mean is...
...as well as I'd like to.
Oh. There's no trouble there...
...girlie-girl!
I've never met a man...
...who sells anvils before.
It's really quite...
...different.
Takes a real salesman,
I can tell you that.
Anvils have a limited appeal, you know.
What am I doing?
If I miss that train, I'll lose my job.
And I got to leave word about Hill.
Leave word with me.
Not on your tintype, girlie-girl.
How do I know you'll deliver these letters?
Try me.
There's your train! Run for it!
You double-dealing-
Who do you think you're protecting?
That guy's got a gal in every county in Illinois...
...and he's taken it away from every one of them. That's 102 counties!
Not counting the piano teachers like you he cozies up to...
...just to keep your mouths shut!
Neither one of you have heard the last of me, girlie-girl!
I'll pop the question
Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose
Without a sweetheart to my name
Good evening, Miss Marian
Lida Rose, how everyone knows
That I am hoping you're the same
Marian!
Marian dear, who was you talking-?
Why, Professor Hill!
Mrs. Paroo, the top of the evening!
Miss Marian.
You and Marian come up and set.
I've got some jelly on the stove.
There's no jelly on the stove.
Well, I'll put some on!
- Shall we "set," as your mother said?
- Really, I don't-
You did ask me to call. Remember?
Did I? I didn't mean anything.
I'm not suggesting your invitation inferred...
...anything but academic enlightenment.
The Think System.
I've been by your house to explain it to you...
...but there always seem to be people around.
Ladies mostly, I thought.
Yes. Mrs. Squires and several of the other ladies.
I'm glad.
I wouldn't want anyone beating my time.
"You wouldn't?"
"No, ma'am."
It's evidently not the convenient evening.
I'll see you at the sociable.
Professor Hill, is it true that you've had 100-?
- What I'm trying to say is-
- Yes?
I was wondering...
...how you developed the Think System.
The Think System?
Oh, the Think System!
It's quite simple, really.
It's as simple as whistling.
No one had to develop an elaborate technique for whistling.
You simply think the tune up here...
...and it comes out clearly here.
Now just suppose you try this yourself.
I'll take your word for it.
Why don't we all sit down?
Are all music teachers as dense as I am?
All music teachers?
I daresay you've met dozens.
Maybe even a hundred.
- Well-
- Are they all as fascinated as I...
...with the Think System?
Some more and some less.
One young lady had thought up the same system.
She showed me a few refinements.
I see.
Have I said something wrong?
Please don't let me keep you.
You must have more important things to do...
...than explain the Think System to me.
Nope, can't think of one.
Come, let's sit.
I must be very dull company for a man of your experience.
Now where'd you ever get an idea like that? Heh-heh.
One hears rumors about traveling salesmen.
Oh, now, you mustn't believe everything you hear.
After all, one even hears rumors about librarians.
I presume you're referring to Uncle Maddy?
- Uncle Maddy?
- Mr. Madison, my father's best friend.
No matter what they say, he left that library job to me...
...so Mother, Winthrop and I could have security.
Surely, you don't believe-
No, but that's just what I'm saying.
Why do you suppose people start rumors?
Narrow-mindedness, jealousy.
Jealousy mostly, I guess.
Exactly!
And jealousy mostly starts rumors about traveling salesmen.
What have you heard?
Oh.
Nothing about you personally.
It's just...
...you know, generally.
What have you heard generally?
Just that-
But of course!
It stands to reason that disappointment and jealousy can lead to-
Well, take you, for instance.
Your attentions to customers...
...and teachers might easily be misconstrued, mightn't they?
I mean now, honestly, mightn't they?
And as you say, if a salesman or somebody were jealous...
...they could be downright lies, now, couldn't they?
- What could?
- Rumors and things!
Of course!
It goes to show, you should never believe everything you hear!
I mean, if you just discuss things!
I'd be delighted to discuss...
...anything in the world with you.
But couldn't we do it sitting down?
You do sit?
Your knees bend and all?
We could sit on the steps, I suppose.
Or on the large hollow log over at the footbridge.
No, I couldn't do that.
I've never been to the footbridge with a man in my life.
Just to talk.
I have to dress for the sociable.
Then meet me there in 15 minutes.
No, I can't.
Please.
Some other time.
Maybe tomorrow.
Please.
Oh, my dear little librarian!
You pile up enough tomorrows and you'll collect...
...nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays.
I don't know about you...
...but I'd like to make today worth remembering.
Oh...
So would I.
The footbridge...
...15 minutes.
Fifteen minutes.
Mama!
- What?!
I told the professor I'd meet him at the footbridge in 15 minutes.
Glory be and the saints be praised!
- It works!
- What works?
I been using the Think System on you from the parlor.
Any of you people Mayor Shinn?
Please, you got to clear this area.
Mrs. Shinn wants to start the entertainment.
No, we want to dance.
Wait'll you see the new steps
Professor Hill taught us.
Mr. Washburn, my group is ready to perform.
- Start her out.
- Okay, what'll it be?
"The Shipoopi!"
Now a woman who'll kiss on the
Very first date is usually a hussy.
And a woman who'll kiss on the
Second time out is anything but fussy
But a woman who'll wait
Till the third time around
Head in the clouds
Feet on the ground
She's the girl he's glad he's found
She's his Shipoopi
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi
The girl who's hard to get
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi
But you can win her yet
Walk her once
Just to raise the curtain
Walk around twice
And you make for certain
Once more in the flower garden
She will never get sore
If you beg her pardon
Do re mi fa so la si do
Si la so fa mi re do
Squeeze her once
When she isn't looking
If you get a squeeze back
That's fancy cooking
Once more for a pepper-upper
She will never get sore
On her way to supper
Do re mi fa so la si do
Si do
Now little old Sal's a no-gal
As anyone could see
Look at her now, she's a go-gal
Who only goes for me
Squeeze her once
When she isn't looking
If you get a squeeze back
That's fancy cooking
Once more for a pepper-upper
She will never get sore
On her way to supper
Do re mi fa so la si do
Si do
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi
The girl who's hard to get
Shipoopi, Shipoopi,
Shipoopi
But you can win her yet
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi
The girl who's hard to get
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi
But you can win her yet
Hey, professor!
Show us some new steps!
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi
The girl who's hard to get
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi
But you can win her yet
You can win her yet
Shipoopi!
Professor Hill-
This is no place to talk.
You won't back down?
I'll come, but I promised
Mother and Winthrop...
...to have a plate of cream with them.
You go along, I'll meet you.
Fifteen minutes.
Fifteen minutes.
And now we arrive at the high-water mark...
...of the evening's festivities.
The River City Ladies'
Eurhythmic Dance Group...
...under the leadership of my wife...
...will give their interpretation of...
Psst.
Grecian urns!
Yes. Grecian urns.
Psst. Psst.
One Grecian urn.
Miss Marian, you're late.
- You said 15 minutes.
- Not that kind of late. I meant...
I'd say about...
...26 years late.
It took you all this time to get to the footbridge with a fella.
If you want to know the truth, it was almost longer.
- Oh?
- Halfway here...
...I nearly turned back.
I suppose I'm not the first person to discover...
...a girl doesn't think clearly under the spell of your salesmanship.
You surely don't think I've been trying to sell you anything?
Oh, no.
You've given me something.
That's why I had to come.
- I don't recall giving you-
- Yes.
Something beautiful.
That's why I came.
And I'm so glad.
Please don't be afraid
I expect too much more.
One can't expect a traveling salesman to stay put.
There've been many ports of call and there'll be many more.
Still, I can be grateful for what you've left behind.
For me.
Marian-
There were bells
On the hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds
In the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you.
And there was music
And there were wonderful roses
They tell me
In sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn
And dew
There was love
All around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you
There was love
All around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was
You
Marian.
There's lots you don't know about me.
I'm not asking.
Excuse me.
I'm expecting a telegram from Rudi Friml.
This could be it.
Who's the salesman? Looks like she's selling and you're buying.
I have to keep her off balance.
She's as off balance as a catboat in a hurricane.
It's just until those uniforms arrive.
They're here and the kids are in them.
Tommy passed out the uniforms and collected most of the money.
Now he's pretending there's a band practice at the lumberyard.
- What time's the freight train go?
40 from the junction.
It isn't even 8: 30 yet.
You better cheese it now while you can!
I came up through the ranks on this skirmish.
I won't resign without my commission.
Now go on, beat it!
Never a peaceful moment in the music business.
Now where were we?
You were going to tell me what I don't know about you.
Yeah.
But we don't have to go into that right now.
Of course not.
We never have to go into that, Harold.
Madam Librarian, you are a lady from the ground up.
The librarian hasn't felt much like doing research lately.
But she did plenty of it when you first came here.
Oh.
About what?
Oh. About Professor Harold Hill...
...Gary Conservatory of Music,
Gold Medal Class of '05.
Harold...
...there wasn't any
Gary Conservatory in '05.
Well, there most cert-
The town wasn't even built until '06.
Walk me home.
I have to get something to draw around my shoulders.
You knew all the time.
I've known since three days after you came here.
I tore this out of the Indiana Journal.
I meant to use it against you.
Now I give it to you with all my heart.
But if you knew-
It's your sweet "Hello, dear"
That sets me up
And it's your "Got to go, dear"
That gets me down
It's you on my pillow
In all of my dreams
Till once more the morning-
Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop, I tell you!
Listen to this man.
Why, you boneheaded, square-toed...
...tank town boobs!
I've been trying to tell you!
Can't you see this music fella's giving you the double shuffle!
He's putting the shake on you...
...taking out your eyeteeth while you look the other way.
What are you saying?
I'll tell you what I'm saying!
This burglar's in the bedroom while you're fiddling in the parlor!
Whose bedroom are the burglars fiddling in?
Quiet.
I'm talking about Harold Hill.
A shell worker.
A flimflammer!
An eighteen-karat thief!
You mean the music professor?
Music professor?
Not on your fireless cooker, mister!
Fellow that organized the band?
There ain't any band.
There ain't never been a band.
There ain't never going to be a band!
Unless you hunt this man down now like a mad dog...
...there won't be a Harold Hill either.
He'll be on his way to the state line.
I said all along, get his credentials, didn't I?
I got his credentials right here!
Well, what are we waiting for?
I want my money back.
I want his hide!
Find him and bring him to the school.
Roped and hogtied, if you have to.
And don't let him give you the slip.
All right, after him!
Have you seen Professor Hill?
Haven't been looking for him.
I'll only be a minute.
While 110 cornets played the air
Then I modestly took my place
As the one and only bass
And I oompahed up and down the square
Good night, my someone
Good night, my love
With 110 cornets right behind
Our star is shining
Its brightest light
There were horns of every shape and-
Sweet dreams be yours, dear
If dreams there be
While 110 cornets played the air
I wish I may
And I wish I might
Now good night
My someone
Good night.
He's not in there.
Try the livery stable!
Try the freight depot!
Let's go, Greg.
The flivver's in the alley, all cranked up!
They're onto you!
That anvil salesman...
...is running all over town spilling everything!
Come on!
Run, professor!
They're talking about tar and feathers.
I've looked all over for Winthrop.
He's run away.
Maybe he's in his room.
It's not often I'm at a loss for words-
It's all right.
Don't you know that?
You don't owe me a word, not a word.
Now hurry, please!
Greg!
He's not around here, folks!
Let's try by the creamery.
- Whoa. Hold on a minute, son.
- I'm not your son. Leave me go!
Not until I talk to you a minute.
I won't listen.
You wouldn't tell the truth anyway.
- I would too.
- Would not!
Tell you anything you want to know.
Can you lead a band?
No!
- Are you a big liar?
- Yes.
- Are you a dirty, rotten crook?
- Yes.
Then leave me go, you big liar!
You wanted the truth, didn't you?
I'm bigger than you, and you're getting it all.
So just stop wiggling.
Now...
There are two things you're entitled to know.
One, you're a wonderful kid.
I thought so from the first.
That's why I wanted you in the band...
...so you'd stop moping around and feeling sorry for yourself.
What band?
I always think there's a band, kid.
What's the other thing
I'm entitled to know?
That's none of your business, come to think of it.
I wish you never came to River City.
No, you don't, Winthrop.
Sister, you believe him?
I believe everything he ever said.
But he promised us!
I know what he promised us, and it all happened just like he said:
The lights, the colors, the cymbals and the flags.
Where was all that?
In the way every kid in town walked around all summer...
...and looked and acted.
Especially you.
And the parents too.
Does Mama wish he'd never come?
Well, you do, don't you?
No, Winthrop.
You'd better go, Harold. Please!
Go on, professor.
Hurry up.
I can't go, Winthrop.
Why not?
Well, for the first time in my life...
...I got my foot caught in the door.
There was love
All around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you.
Greg!
Greg, they're here!
Run this way!
Go on, professor! That way, that way!
And always remember, fellow River City-zeeans...
...I did everything in my power to prevent this dire...
...happening from...
...happening.
Fourscore-
How will you get our money back?
That professor collected almost
$300 on uniforms just tonight.
I haven't seen a uniform or my boy either since just after supper.
He's a kidnapper!
That's a fine situation we have here!
Fourscore-
Just a minute!
Virtue has triumphed!
The sword of restibution...
...has cut down...
...Professor Harold Hill.
And if there are those, as I've heard...
...who are melting tar and plucking feathers...
...I will not say them nay!
I should think some of you could forget your everlasting lowa stubbornness...
...long enough to remember what this town was like before Harold Hill came.
Do you?
- Well, do you?
- Hold up, there!
And then after he came!
Suddenly there were things to do...
...and things to be proud of...
...and people to go out of your way for.
Surely some of you can be grateful for what this man has brought to us.
I'd think you'd want to admit it!
You're wasting a great deal of time!
If there's a person in this hall...
...who doesn't want this man
Hill tarred and feathered...
...let him, by God, stand up!
Eulalie, sit down!
And the rest of you, who are standing there like Shropshire sheep!
Maybe you can remember other things.
Like what you paid for uniforms...
...technical instruction books and band instruments.
With the understanding...
...your children would be taught to play in a band!
Well, where's the band?
Where's the band?!
Oh...
No, I couldn't!
Now, think, men.
Think!
That's my Barney!
That tuba's my Barney!
Wonderful, Barney.
That's Eddie! That's Eddie's clarinet!
Oh. Oh.
Linus!
Play to me, son!
Play to me!
Davey!
That's my Davey!
Oh!
76 trombones led the big parade
With 110 cornets close at hand
They were followed by rows and rows
Of the finest virtuosos
The cream of every famous band
76 trombones caught the morning sun
With 110 cornets right behind
There were more than a thousand reeds
Springing up like weeds
There were horns
Of every shape and kind
There were copper-bottom timpani
In horse platoons
Thundering, thundering
All along the way
Double bell euphoniums
And big bassoons
Each bassoon
Having his big fat say
There were 50 mounted cannon
In the battery
Thundering, thundering
Louder than before
Clarinets of every size
And trumpeters who'd improvise
A full octave higher than the score!
He's sitting all alone.
Should l talk to him?
Or perhaps go out? l don't know, whatever you like
Why are you gawping?
Shall we go for a stroll?
Sister won't be coming, you know
Firefly, man has no pity for you! l've kept them waiting. A friend of mine works there lf it's a good job, take it
Leave the hostel, find a nice flat and marry a nice girl
Let's see
The way you are, your life will pass in gawping
My sandals. Take them off
Mine are unwearable. l went to a concert with my maestro...
Work, and wear what you like
Dear Montu, give me some money
Eight annas, four... How much can you scrounge off Neeta? My hair's so long...
Shouldn't a beggar look like a beggar?
Brother, go to your room
You're upset, aren't you?
''l've raised you since you were kids''
Let him talk
Get some clothes made
Get a haircut and look decent.
Buy a pair of sandals
No, you'll suffer. Those who suffer for others, suffer for ever
You're a complete idiot. ln the words of Banshi Dutt:
''Sinbad the Sailor'' - or how could a fool like me make a fool of you?
What sort of boy is Sanat?
Why?
That boy has no principles
Where does all the money go?
Your salary, the tuition money,
Montu's salary... lt's difficult
You'll end up with no home, no money
Sister, here's the money
-Only fifty?
-l had to pay a month's hostel fee
He's decided to live in the factory hostel from now on
Leaving home?
Yes, it's hard to get there from here, and a sportsman needs good food
We could arrange it here
No, l'll come and give you whatever l can spare
Young chap, he has his needs
And his old folks just sit and eat
Go and get the shopping l saw Sanat at our head office today
He's in the Stores Department. lmagine that, a science student
-What salary?
-Three hundred at least
The boss is his pal, you see
Sanat isn't here, he left last month
You'd like to have his address, l suppose l took a job
Are you leaving?
Have you thought of getting
Geeta married?
No, Neeta first. One should think serially
You've educated her, that's why she can run the household lt's less difficult to find a groom for a working girl
Get her married. You'll have time enough to twiddle your thumbs
What will happen here if she leaves?
You can't exploit the poor girl all her life
So what will you eat?
-Where have you been?
-Out for a stroll
-Your exams are soon
-Exams are beyond me
-What, then?
-Marriage
-To whom? Does Ma know?
-Sanat
Rushing into the noon sun won't help
Not everyone has patience; something you ought to know
-Any news of Montu?
-He's playing a match in Delhi
Geeta was talking about your ear-rings and bangles - you know her
She needs them more than l do
Listen, l didn't really want it like this
-How much yoghurt?
-Whatever you think ln the past they married daughters off to the dying. They were barbarians
Now we are educated, civilized
We educate our girl, wring her dry and destroy her future
That's the difference lt's time for tea. l'll get it for you
Childhood seems so far away
And those hills... they don't seem to be of this earth
No one climbs hills any more; they plumb the depths instead l've got a job in a music school.
Don't tell Ma
Continue your studies, too. l'll organize the funds
Will you teach me one of
Tagore's songs?
Soft-hearted idiots like you get hurt most!
Then keep me in a glass case, like a wax doll l'm leaving home
Even though l'm a nobody l can't take it any more l'm leaving in protest
You'll go on suffering in silence and get smothered
Want to learn a song? l'll have to sing at the wedding
The night the storm blew open
my doors
Little did l know that you
would come in
Everything went dark
The lamp dimmed
l reached up to the heavens,
not knowing why
Little did l know that
you would come in
ln darkness l lay dreaming
Could l know that the storm
was the pennant of your triumph?
ln the morning did l see
You standing there
Standing in what was an empty room
Haven't you gone to work? l'm not well. l'm feverish
You've stopped going to the library
-A letter from Montu's factory
-What about?
Last night's shift... he's badly hurt
The machine caught him.
This was expected l'm going to the hospital
This was expected.
How else could it end?
The surgeon said he'll need a blood transfusion
Will it cost a lot?
Yes. The crisis isn't over yet
Your skin's very warm. You're running about with such a fever?
-l'm often like this
-Every evening? Get an X-ray
She's terribly withdrawn, doctor
She won't say what's on her mind. l sense trouble
She's feverish
All because of Montu's accident
All this running about these last two days lf you can spare the time, please take a look at her l've come to see Geeta l haven't eaten. Can l have some water?
-Where has she gone?
-To bed
Not at the office? l don't go quite often. l don't like it
And your office?
Montu is in hospital after an accident l've been in a terrible state
He needs a blood transfusion. l hadn't even time to inform you
Neeta's here
So l see. How long have you been here? lt's getting late. l must go
-You let her go?
-She didn't come to see me
You're jumping to conclusions
No need
Montu's in hospital after an accident
Neeta came with something on her mind
What's your name, dear girl? lt would be wise to have an X-ray. l can easily arrange it
What if l'm really ill? l'm the family breadwinner
Anyway, please pay for the transfusion
-How's Montu?
-All right
What about some tea?
Can you help me to get some money for blood and medicines? l can't raise any. That's why l came to see Geeta
-How much?
-About 150 rupees l feel dizzy
Rest a little, for your own sake
My own sake... looking like a corpse. lt's hard, earning one's bread l'll give you the money here tomorrow
-There were 150 rupees here
-l gave them to Ma
You mean Neeta
-l did. lt's my money
-An old flame
Getting nasty won't help. l'm warning you
Come to me, my daughter Uma
Let me garland you with flowers
You are the soul of my sad self,
mother deliverer
Let me bid you farewell, my daughter
You leave my home desolate.
How can l endure your departure?
Heard about Shankar? They say he's made a name for himself in Bombay
What's happened? Making your bed so late, in the outer room? lnner or outer, what does it matter in this forlorn house?
You won't tell me anything, will you?
Time was, mother, but you didn't hear
There's such a void between us
My life seems unsupportable
Hence this barrier
Must you wail now? l must work tomorrow
Going to work?
Something l wanted to say
-What can you do about it?
-l can't put on an act
Not an act
Penance maybe
Penance? What have you done? l've never protested against any injustice
That's my sin l shouldn't have accepted it, surely
Go home
Have you nothing to say?
What can l say? l'm removed from it all
There's only work now
Neeta, you're whole again. l want to be whole, too l'll leave my job...
...go back to a life of struggle l'm not completely lost to a sense of... l can't bang my head on the wall for ever
Give her this medicine in the evening.
Keep an eye on her
She fainted
Are you feeling ill? l can ask for you to have leave
No, it's useless
A poor Brahman in Mathura
Who had never known happiness
Once begged for a whole day
And returned without a grain
He sat beneath a tree, downcast
He sat beneath a tree and wept
Then the sage Satyanarayana
Approached in the guise of a fakir
Let's have a look
Go away
God doesn't overwhelm you all at once. ln time you learn to bear up
The boss himself brought him home
My Montu still has a job
They'll pay good compensation, too.
More than 1,000 rupees, isn't it?
On this auspicious day, you're happy
with your friends lt's Shankar, isn't it?
Your picture's in the papers.
Made it big in Bombay, have you?
You're the pride of Bengal, lad
Let 'em know that Bengal has tigers, too
You get 500 per concert?
No, l don't accept less than 1,200
Your perfumed body, your forehead
marked with sandel-paste
Doe-eyed, with sweeping lashes
May your wisdom be for your people
And be happy with your lord
and friends
Lots of people talk about you
You must give me a necklace, if it's a boy
Will you never live at home? lf this house is so bad, change it
Will we ever lose the fear of eviction?
Yet here people strike roots, build a nest, forget their troubles
Tell him. l've always wanted a two-storey house
Demolish this and build two storeys
The clay-walled room can stay and be restored
My mind... can you restore that, too?
So that l can read Wordsworth again and be fulfilled
Where's Khuki? ln that room. Goes to work, then stays in there. Eats there, too
Talks to no one. Keeps everything hidden
Feverish, ill... she doesn't tell
Even washes her own dishes
Hiding love letters even now? l was just thinking...
...how each of you has found a niche
Now as in childhood...
...l have no responsibilities
What's the matter?
Khuki has T.B. lt's serious
My poor sister l accuse!
Whom?
No one l'll arrange treatment for her. l'll stay here tonight l've packed your things
You go away
They dream of two storeys
You've been successful
You've put them on their feet, dear
What would they be without you?
They pity you today
You weren't up to carrying the burden, but you had to
You're the burden yourself now
There's poison in your breath
This room is for the newborn
Go away, dear
Come to me, my daughter Uma
Let me garland you with flowers
You are the soul of my sad self,
mother deliverer
Let me bid you farewell now,
my daughter
You leave my home desolate,
going to your husband's house
How can l endure your departure,
my daughter?
Where are you going? l've made the arrangements.
A sanatorium in Shillong
And then...
You'll see the hills at last
Does she like the hills?
''Cloud-capped star''
Sanat's letter l wonder why l kept it so long
Our house has a second storey now.
Geeta's son is toddling about ls he naughty?
Does he jump about a lot?
He's made life hell for father
He climbs the stairs all by himself
The kid's so full of life
He loves climbing the stairs l wanted to live!
Tell me just once that l'll live l want to go home, Brother. l want to live!
Did you visit your sister?
How is she now?
Why don't you say something?
No one remembers her here any more
She went by every day, sandals flapping
Such a quiet girl. Why did she suffer so much?
Come to me, my daughter Uma
Let me garland you with flowers
You are the soul of my sad self,
mother deliverer
Let me bid you farewell now,
my daughter
You leave my home desolate,
going to your husband's house
How can l endure your departure,
my daughter?

Hi, Maile.
Hi, Eddie.
I thought maybe you were mad at me.
I haven't had to chase you for a week.
Now, Eddie...
Sorry. You're not going to talk me out of it.
But I'm in a big hurry.
It is important.
How many times do I have to warn you?
If you fly now, you'll pay later.
Please, no lectures.
I'm late.
Chad's coming home.
Chad?
Home from Europe?
His plane's probably landing at the airport right now.
Follow me.
Let's don't keep the soldier waiting.
Oh, thank you, Eddie.
Thanks, Eddie! Bye!
Hi, Wahilla.
Hello, Maile. You got passengers coming in?
Just one. Chad's out of the Army.
Chad? Here, with my compliments.
Oh, mahalo.
United Airlines flight now arriving at United Airlines ramp.
Oh, Wahilla,
I think I'm scared.
He's been gone for 2 years.
What if he's changed?
Just be patient with him.
Some boys need time to get adjusted to being back home.
Some of them get the hang of it right away.
Hi, Maile.
Hi, Wahilla.
Hi, Chad.
It worked.
She's jealous.
She should be.
Please, come along.
Get going, will you?
Move along.
He's been in the service overseas.
For 2 years,
I was there.
I was over 3 years, but all I got when I came back was coffee and donuts.
Excuse me, sir.
Thanks again.
Thank you.
Maile.
I'd welcome you home, but I'm not speaking to you.
Hey!
I was only having some fun.
I saw you.
You knew I'd be waiting for you.
How could you kiss that girl?
It was easy.
I mean, you call that a kiss?
That's a kiss.
My French blood tells me to argue with you, and my Hawaiian blood tells me not to, and they're really battling it out inside of me.
I've never seen a more beautiful battleground.
All right, soldier.
You win.
Yeah.
Welcome home.
I wonder where he took his basic training.
In Hawaii.
Sure you don't want to drive?
It's still your car, you know.
Uh-uh. No.
I'm fine right here.
You sure kept them both in good shape.
Both?
Mm-hmm. Your body and my car's.
Pupule.
I'll show you who's crazy. Hit it!
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm not going home now.
Wikiwiki...
To the beach.
I missed you, Maile.
I missed you, too.
What were you doing all that time while I was missing you?
Ahem.
Uh, being true to you.
Always?
Almost always.
You mean to tell me...

♪ Well, almost always true to you ♪

Hi there!
Well, what are we waiting for?
- Got your bathing suit?
- Uh-uh.
Don't worry about it.
I brought you one from Paris.
But I've got a job, remember?
Not today.
It's a Hawaiian holiday.
Didn't your mother ever tell you about hooky-hooky day?
Hooky-hooky.
Come on.
The old shack.
The boys really kept it up, didn't they?
I used to think a lot about this place.
I was afraid it might change, but it's still beautiful.
Now, this is for me.
You're not going to stay here.
Why not? I got a roof over my head, a cot, and a stove... but you've got a beautiful house in Kahala and a family.
Look, let's get this over with.
All the time
I was overseas,
I got a letter from my folks every week reminding me of my beautiful home and my beautiful future in my dad's beautiful pineapple business.
And the more they reminded me, the more I knew
I couldn't come back with the rest of my life all laid out for me.
No, Maile.
It's too easy to fall into a ready-made setup.
I got to do this on my own. I got to do it myself.
Can't you tell them that?
- I will!
- Good!
When the time is right.
Please don't take too much time.
I don't know how long
I can wait for you to grow up.
Oh, you're a pretty fresh kid.
I think I'll let you have one.
Why, you little... so on, so forth, and so on!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
No, Chad, no!
No! Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Oh!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha! Ohh...
What's so funny?
I bought this dress to welcome you home.
It's the first time
I've worn it.
You want to know something?
On you, wet is my favorite color.
Hi.
Hello there.
Where'd you come from?
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?
Could I play with you?
I think you're a little young for this game.
If I get a girl, can I play with you?
He's not as young as I thought.
The game's over, pal.
Maybe some other time, OK?
Bye.
Bye.
What do you say we go for a swim?
Might as well.
We can't dance.
The suit's in this bag.
- Ready?
- Almost.
Did you really buy this in Paris?
The first 3-day pass
I had. How's it fit?
You tell me.
And, uh, wow.
Don't you think the sleeves are a little long?
I used to dream of you wearing a muumuu.
Well, if my grandmother ever saw me in this, she'd sew me up in a muumuu... For life.
Don't you like it?
Oh, I love it.
And I thank you for thinking of me.
Oh, I wasn't thinking of you.
I was thinking of me.
Now can I play?
Can he play?
Ha ha ha!
Sure, kids. Later.
You said I can play.
Later.
Hey, it's Chad!
Maile!
Hello, Chad! Maile!
Hello there!

Not yet!
Hey, dig this crazy seaweed.
That's no seaweed.
That's the top of Maile's bathing suit!
H-h-hey, Maile, just stay right there!
Hey, Maile, don't come out!

Exactly what time your plane leaves and lands in Maui.
Thank you very much, young lady.
Have a nice time.
Thank you.
Come back and see us.
Bye.
Hello, Mr. Gates.
Hello, Maile.
I'll come right to the point.
Is my son here?
Chad? Here?
You know what I mean.
I've heard he's been home for several days.
If this is true, I know that you've seen him.
Well?
That's good enough for me.
Chad's mother doesn't know about this, and I want him home before she finds out.
If he doesn't consider my feelings, he does owe some consideration to his mother.
I leave it to you.
Good-bye, Maile.
Good-bye, Mr. Gates.
Hi, O'Hara.
Hi.
Don't you dig judo?
Man don't live on muscles alone.
You got any ketchup in that bag?
No, but I have some lipstick.
Same color.
Nah. Lipstick, like, fattening.
I'm on a diet.
Oh, yeah.
Where's Chad?
Back in the briny.
It's just like he never left.
Even though there's no surf, he's right back in the swim.
Well, he's about to be beached.
Well, it's about time you got here.
I sneaked away half an hour early as it is.
The fellas are playing for a luau tonight at the outrigger.
I told them to count us in.
Can't. The whole family's meeting in Haleiwa tonight.
At your grandmother's?
It's her birthday.
She's 78.
Well, that's something to celebrate.
Am I invited?
You're hiding out, remember?
Not from your folks.
Yours, either.
Huh?
Your father came to see me today.
He knows you're back.
You've got to go home sometime. Why?
You can't spend the rest of your life on a surfboard.
Oh, yes, I can.
The G.I. bill of rights says I get my old job back.
This is my old job.
Like I said, yankee, go home!
Hey, wait a...
Hey, wait!
I'll get you!
It's certainly nice to have you here.
Thank you, Fred.
Oh, here we are.
Daddy, let's drink a toast to your boss.
Aloha, Jack.
Aloha.
Aloha, daddy.
Aloha.
You know, every time I come here,
I feel like a prize fool.
I've seen the latest company statement raising the dividends.
You're no fool, boss.
Oh, no? Then how come
I moved you here and kept myself on the mainland?
To your glorious
Hawaiian winters.
Aloha, Jack.
Aloha.
Aloha.
Missa Gates! Missa Gates!
Missa Gates! Missa Gates!
Missa Gates!
Missa Gates, guess who here!
He's home!
Just drive up in car, all the way from Army!
Who?
Our boy Chadwick!
Chadwick!
Oh, daddy, Jack, it's Chadwick!
My boy's home from the war!
Sarah Lee, there wasn't any war.
Well, don't just stand there!
Aloha.
Chadwick?
Oh, Chadwick, my boy!
Hiya, Mom!
Welcome home, son.
Hi, Pop. Hey, Jack!
Didn't expect to see you here.
Arrived yesterday.
Just checking up on your old man.
You're looking good, fella.
Thank you.
Ping Pong, will you shut off that water?
Don't get wet.
Hello, Mr. Chadwick.
You have swinging time in Europe?
Pingo, the swingingest, boy.
How are you, boy?
Hi, Jack. Hi, Pop.
Doesn't he look marvelous in uniform?
Go get the camera, daddy.
Later, Sarah Lee.
Later.
Come on in. We got so much to talk about.
I have to get my bags, Mom.
Don't worry, Mr. Chadwick.
I get bags...
Aloha!
I got it!
I got it!
Ping Pong, tell cook we'll let her know when to start serving.
We want to talk to our boy.
Oui, oui, missy.
We must give a welcome-home party for Chadwick, daddy, and it could be for Jack, too.
Oh, forget about me, Sarah Lee.
Just invite
Chad's friends.
You mean those nasty little beach boys?
Oh, no. Now that
Chadwick's home,
I'm sure he's got all that foolishness out of his system...
After the war.
Sarah Lee, how many times do
I have to tell you, he was not in a war.
Oh, I know you're right, daddy, but if I don't tell myself there was a war,
I have a most depressing feeling
Chadwick's just wasted 2 years.
Chadwick, sweet boy.
Sure feels good to get back into civvies, Mom.
Oh, why'd you take off your soldier suit?
You looked so handsome in it, just like
Stonewall Jackson.
Hey, you got some sugar for your mama?
How about a drink before dinner, civilian?
Why don't you give him some of your pineapple juice, Jack?
Missed it, huh, boy?
Yeah.
You should try the new rum drink.
Jack...
Chadwick's a growing boy, Fred, and I don't think it proper for his daddy to give him intoxicating libations.
Mom, I'd like to tell you about the...
We were just talking about your party, son.
What party?
Your coming-home party to celebrate your return from the war.
We can have the Wilsons and the pomfrets.
Oh, yes, they're a must.
They get absolutely hilarious at parties.
They get absolutely stoned, is what they get.
Yes.
Uh, Chadwick,
I think it would be much impressier if you wore your uniform with all the medals you won.
I didn't win any medals, Mom.
Of course you won medals.
What were all those on your soldier suit?
Just marksmanship and good conduct.
Oh, you see, daddy?
Every soldier wins one if he hits the target instead of an officer.
Oh, you put me in mind of my great-grandfather on my side,
Captain Matthew Polk.
Oh, he was one o the bravest men in the war between the states.
Oh, the daring deeds that man performed, his bravery under fire, his courage on the field of battle made us all proud to be Polks.
Oh, it's such a shame
Captain Polk was a damn yankee.
Chad, which one do you want?
Well, let me see.
You need it, boy.
Take your pick.
Whew.
I think I'll stick to the straight pineapple juice.
We must decide on the orchestra for the party.
Oh, well, if you'll excuse me,
I think I'll freshen up a little before dinner.
Aloha.
Yeah.
Orchestra? Say, Mom, how about my friends?
You mean those native boys?
The swingingest group in the islands.
Oh, they are not musicians, Chadwick.
They're just beach boys.
Mom, they've turned professional.
They do a lot of work around town.
How'd you know that?
Uh, why... he corresponded with them while he was in Europe.
Now, Chadwick, we might as well have an understanding right off.
You've come home to stay, and your life's going to be different.
You're going to associate yourself with the finer elements on this island, and you're going to have a responsible position with the Great Southern
Hawaiian Fruit Company, and you're going to marry a girl of your own class and be a gentleman like your daddy.
Mom, do we have to discuss this now?
Yes. I don't want you wasting your precious time on those beach boys or that native girl.
Sarah Lee, the boy just came home.
I think he should know exactly what we expect of him.
I know what you expect of me.
I thought maybe after a hitch in the army,
I could come back and do what you want me to, but now I know I can't.
Well, how do you know?
You just got back.
I've been back for 5 days, Mom.
5 days?
Yes, and for 5 days,
I've been at the beach, living in my shack and dreading the time
I would have to come back here and tell you
I'm not going to go to work for the Great Southern
Hawaiian Fruit Company.
Sarah Lee.
Yes, daddy?
Let's talk about it tomorrow, son.
Home 5 days, and he didn't even come to his mother.
Mom, it's time
I started doing something for myself, like making my own decisions.
Chadwick!
Chadwick!
Your mother hasn't finished, and you haven't had your dinner.
All of a sudden,
I'm not hungry.
Good night.
And he didn't even give his mama any good-night sugar.
Sarah Lee, there are times when I could wring your fool neck.
Good evening, sir.
I'll take care of your car.
Thank you.
Grandma!
No! No, no.
No, no, no!
Well, it is a pleasant surprise, Chad.
Thanks, Mr. Duval.
We were not expecting you.
I just came by to pay my respects to Maile's grandmother.
Maile!
We have a visitor.
He says he dropped by to pay his respects to your grandmother.
Excuse me.
I thought you were going home.
I did. I'm out on good behavior.
Mmm.
Your father said he was glad to see me.
Well, I'm glad to see you, too.
Come wish grandmother a happy birthday.
Grandmother, you remember Chad.
I am delighted to see you again, Chad.
Welcome back from the army.
Aloha, Mrs. manaka, and happy birthday.
I brought you a gift from Austria.
Thank you, but the light you kindle in my granddaughter's eye is gift enough.
It's a music box.
It plays a European love song, but they're the same in any language.

That's lovely, Chad.
And so are you, grandmother.
Sure beats lunch in town, doesn't it?
Mmm.
You don't get this view in town, either.
No, and it was easier to get a reservation here.
Your grandmother packs a pretty picnic.
The way to a man's heart.
She's making sure
I reach yours, especially after last night.
She loved the music box.
I'm glad.
She's a wonderful lady.
The difference between your family and mine.
We're not our families, Chad.
We're what we make of ourselves.
You know, you're right.
And if I'm going to make anything of myself, it's about time to get started and take hold of things.
While you're in the mood to take hold...
Maile, I've got to get a job.
And, I gather,
not in your father's pineapple plant.
No, ma'am.
No red carpet, where everybody knows who I am.
"He's the boss' son.
Be nice to him." that's not for me.
Hawaii has a big future.
I want to become a part of it.
I'm young and healthy.
I'm not too stupid.
Well, wonderful.
This place is growing by leaps and bounds.
There are more tourists come here than any other state in the union.
Hey, that's it!
I'm glad you thought of it.
What did I think of?
Tourist business...
Your business.
It's booming, isn't it?
It's getting bigger all the time.
I know every inch of these islands.
I'd make a good tourist guide.
You'd make a great tourist guide.
I'll put a word in with my boss.
No, you don't.
I'll put in my own word.
This mission is strictly solo, you hear?
You're coming in loud and proud.
I got to get going.
I got to see your boss!
I've wasted too much time already.
Chad!
Haven't you forgotten something?
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Hey! Hey!
What about me?
Oh. Oh, yeah!
These are not only decorative, but they keep my neck warm.
Now, then, let me see.
Where were we?
Uh, we were somewhere, weren't we?
Oh, yes. I was telling you about my having 2 years at the university before I went to the mainland and joined the army.
The army? Oh.
Well, that's a lovely organization.
Yes.
And you say you've lived here for 50 years?
50... No, 15 years, ever since my father was transferred from the Atlanta office.
That's where Chad was born,
Mr. Chapman.
Huh?
Atlanta.
Oh! Oh, he was.
Yes.
Where is the crouching lion?
That's a rock formation on a cliff just north of kaaawa beach.
It used to be a native fishing shrine.
Well. Say, that's good.
That's very good.
Yes, that's excellent.
I'm testing you, you see.
Have to be on your toes if you want to work for a man like me, eh, Miss Duval?
Yes, sir.
Yes, you do.
Now, then, I am a tourist from Chillicothe, Ohio, and I want to see some night-blooming cereus blossoms.
Where would you take me?
I would take you to the Punahou School.
The Punahou... you would?
That is good.
Yes, well...
That's splendid.
This young man knows,
Miss Duval.
I think he might do.
He might.
Well, I'll think it over.
When will you let me know, sir?
Well, when I know, of course.
Oh. Yes, sir.
Thank you,
Mr. Chapman.
Thank you,
Mr. Chapman.
Beautiful.
Beautiful!
That's Mr. Chadwick.
Quick, cover it up,
Ping Pong.
I don't want him to see it.
Oh, everything looks so festive, doesn't it, daddy?
Yes.
Where's Chadwick?
He's on the telephone.
Straighten your tie.
Oh, I do hope he's dressed.
Is he dressed?
He was the last time
I looked.
Fetch me a mai-tai,
Ping Pong.
Oh, we got enough bar glasses? I'll check.
Oh, do that.
Oh, parties, parties.
Mr. Chapman didn't promise anything when I saw him today.
I know, but something came up unexpectedly, and he needs you.
It's a new client...
A schoolteacher.
A schoolteacher?
She wants to meet you.
Now?
It won't take long.
Meet me at the
Hawaiian Village Hotel in half an hour.
Suppose she doesn't like me?
I never had much luck with schoolteachers.
She'll like you.
Just don't be late.
I'll pick you up.
Pick who up?
10 minutes, OK?
Good-bye.
I have to run out for about an hour, Mom.
Oh, but you can't.
Our guests will be arriving soon.
We're having cocktails at 7:00 and dinner at 8:30.
Who was that on the telephone?
Maile Duval.
I consented to engage your beach boys to provide music for your party, but I will not...
If you want me back in time, let's not start anything now, please.
Chadwick?
Yes?
Fix your tie.
Ohh...
She's supposed to meet us right out here.
Have you met her before?
No, I haven't.
We shouldn't have any difficulty in finding a schoolteacher.
I could spot one a mile away.
Uh-oh.
Mm-hmm.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
I'm Miss Duval from the Hawaii tourist guide service, and this is Mr. Gates.
How do you do?
I'm Mrs. Ingersol.
And I'm
Abigail Prentace...
How do you do?
The schoolteacher.
Sure... you can spot them a mile away.
Won't you join me?
Why, certainly.
We beg your pardon, ma'am.
I'm terribly sorry.
That's all right,
Miss Duval.
I didn't expect a tourist guide dressed like Mr. Gates.
He is the guide, isn't he?
Yes, ma'am. These aren't my working clothes.
My mother's giving a party tonight.
Mr. Gates comes from one of our finest families.
Well, that's certainly in his favor.
I must be extremely careful because I'm chaperoning
4 teenage girls.
That's a responsibility not to be taken lightly.
I get along very well with teenagers.
I used to be one myself.
And not too long ago.
Frankly, Miss Duval,
I was expecting an older man.
Miss Prentace, as part of the service,
I promise to, uh, get a little older every day.
Of course, if you would prefer another guide,
I'm sure that the office could arrange it for you.
We'd like to keep our customers perfectly satisfied.
Mr. Gates, do you think you can satisfy a schoolteacher and 4 teenage girls?
Oh, I'll sure try, ma'am.
I-I-I'll do all I can.
Well, what I mean is, this is our first trip to the islands, and the girls are naturally curious about the local activities, such as surfboard riding.
Can you arrange instructions for them?
I'll teach them myself.
You?
I grew up on a surfboard.
Outriggers, catamarans...
I can handle them all.
How wonderful.
Chad used to be an expert at all outdoor sports.
Used to be?
Well, before he went in the army.
He's been gone for 2 years.
He just got back, and I'm afraid he's a little rusty.
I'm afraid Miss Duval doesn't realize how well-oiled
I kept my machinery.
What time do we start in the morning?
9:00 all right? Here?
We'll be waiting, and thank you for coming by.
It's a pleasure meeting you.
And you.
Thank you.
Maile?
They didn't build teachers like that when I went to school.
Oh, she's all right, if you happen to like older women.
If she's older women, the rest of the group are in big trouble. Ha!
You can drop me off at my house.
What do you mean drop you off?
We got to celebrate my new job.
Aren't you supposed to be at your mother's party?
Shh. I'm the guide now, remember?
Oh, do be careful, daddy.
Those mai-tais can be mighty powerful.
Yeah!
Oh, thank you, daddy.
Hello, darlings.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Gates.
This is a lovely party.
Oh, thank you.
I want you to try some of this dip.
It's an old
Carolina recipe.
My grandmother Polk brought it all the way from Charleston to Savannah.
It's delicious.
Hello, dears.
Good evening.
Oh, isn't it delightful?
It's all so festive.
Oh, Ping Pong,
I want you to be sure that Mr. karnibad's glass doesn't get too empty,
s'il vous plait.
Oui, oui, missy.
Oh, that's French.
Ping Pong's learning to speak it.
So nice of you to come to my party.
Oh, there you are, admiral Anthony.
I see you folks have met admiral Anthony.
General Anthony,
Mrs. Gates.
Oh, you may be only a general now, but it's only a matter of time before they make you an admiral.
Hi, Chad.
Hi, Maile.
Hello, everybody.
Daddy?
Excuse me. Yeah?
Look.
Oh, good. Chad's here.
Yeah, but look who's with him.
It's that girl.
Yes.
She's very attractive.
Daddy, aren't you forgetting yourself?
I'm trying, mother.
I'm trying.
Well, hello, Maile.
Nice to see you again.
Thank you.
Maile, this is my mother.
It's about time you two met.
Mom, Maile Duval.
Very glad to meet you,
Mrs. Gates.
Chad's talked so much about you.
He has?
Oh, that's nice,
Chadwick.
Oh, he's talked about you, too.
Oh, yes. We've both talked about you.
Ha ha.
Ahem.
Yes.
Hey, men, looks like Maile's on the rack.
Are you going to stay for Chadwick's party, Miss Duval?
I'd like to very much.
Well, let's get her off.
Yeah. Let's rock!

What was that?
Something we may have to get used to, Sarah Lee.
It's called the sound of youth.
Oh.
Good morning,
Miss Prentace.
Good morning,
Miss Duval.
Girls, Miss Duval.
Hello, Miss Duval.
Good morning, girls.
These are alohas for you.
How lovely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, how wonderful.
This is very nice of you.
Good morning,
Miss Prentace.
Well, I must say, you look more like a guide this morning.
But you still don't look like a schoolteacher.
Girls, may I present our guide?
Shall we start our tour with the pineapple fields?
I hate pineapples.
Then let's go there first and get it over with.
Are you going with us?
No, thanks.
I have to get back to my office.
Can we give you a lift?
Oh, that's not necessary.
It's just a few steps.
Thank you.
I hope you don't mind being this crowded.
I don't mind at all.
Would you mind closing the door, please?
Well, have fun.
Aloha.
As you know, girls, this is the island of Oahu, and Honolulu, our capital city, is the largest of all the islands.
Anybody know the population?
Population...
Population...
Last count,
Correct.
Give the young lady a 5-pound box of broken records.
Call me Beverly.
Right, Bev.
I'm Patsy.
My name's Selena, but call me Sandy.
And what's your name?
You may call me
Miss Corbett.
La di da da!
You might be interested to know that since 1778, we've been welcoming malihinis from all over the world.
Welcoming what?
Malihinis.
That's us.
I thought we were wahines.
You're both.
Malihini means newcomers.
Wahine means female.
What do you know?
We're wahine malihinis.
Big deal.
Patsy, must you?
I did it!
I'm bored!
That's quite rude, Ellie!
Chad was talking.
That's OK,
Miss Prentace.
Make it louder, duchess.

All right, everybody out.
This is one of our smaller pineapple fields.
What are those women doing?
They're picking the ripe fruit.
The conveyor belt hauls it to the trucks and then to the factories.
How come they still pick them by hand?
Before you pick a pineapple, you got to be sure it's ripe enough, and nothing can beat the human eye in deciding when it's ready.
Well, that's interesting.
Nobody ever came up with anything better than the human hand to reach into these little leaves and break them off.
That doesn't look so tough.
Oh, no?
Try it.
Be careful.
Ow! It bites!
See what I mean?
These things are tricky.
They're full of sharp little edges.
Can you get us a pineapple, Chad?
Oh, I think that could be arranged.
Nice, cold slices of pineapple at this little stand right over here.
Pineapples?
What did you expect? Bananas?
Ellie, don't you want some?
Hello, Mr. Gates.
Hello. My friends would like some pineapple.
Certainly.
I bet it's delicious.
I feel like something cool.
Have you ever tried it with salt?
Salt?
It's real good.
I'll take this to Ellie.
Uh, I thought you might like some.
I don't.
It's good. Why don't you try it?
Thank you.
That's pretty rude.
Are you always so bored, or is it me?
Life is a bore,
I always say.
Oh, already?
I've had
17 years of it.
That's the fun part.
Wait till the next 17.
Look, don't you start that child psychology bit.
I'm no child.
I'm no psychologist.
I believe you're being paid to show us a good time.
When does it start?
The others seem to be enjoying themselves.
They're a bunch of drips.
Then why did you come over with them?
It wasn't my idea.
I've got 2 mothers and 3 fathers.
Oh, you must come from a very rich family.
You're a very funny man.
Now, look, I'm sorry...
Don't be sorry.
Just come up with some action.
Got a match?
I don't use them.
It figures.
What's your idea of action?
What's yours?
You're a very funny girl.
Just wait and see.
Yes, Mr. Chapman?
Miss Duval, come in here, please.
Yes, sir.
Yes, now, dear, but...
Well, I certainly will, dear. Of course.
All right.
8:30 sharp, huh?
All right, dear.
Good-bye.
Just talked to my wife.
I promised to take her to the concert tonight.
Oh, I must remember that, too. The concert.
Now, then, Miss Duval, what is it you want?
Uh, Mr. Chapman, you sent for me.
I did?
Well, what is it
I want?
Has it anything to do with Chad?
Chad who?
Chad Gates, remember?
Oh! Oh, yes.
Oh, say, he's a fine-looking boy.
He's bright, too.
We should hire him.
He's been working for you for 2 days.
He's the guide for Miss Prentace and the girls.
Uh, gir... girls?
Wait a minute.
Look here.
I don't want any of my guides carrying on with girls.
There's no hanky-panky on this job.
Mr. Chapman, it's all right.
He's just showing them the local color.
Tonight, he's taking them to a hukilau.
Hukilau, eh?
Oh, well, that sounds like fun.
Oh, my fish.
Well, you should enjoy that.
I'm not going.
He's taking
Miss Prentace and the girls.
Ah, Miss Prentace.
Oh, she's a lovely woman, that Miss Prentace.
They make a handsome couple...
Yes, young Gates and Miss Prentace.
They do?
Yes.
Miss Prentace is quite taken with the boy, too.
She's even extended her tour.
Now, that's hanky-panky from where I stand.
What? Oh, excuse me.
Well, please sit down.
No, Mr. Chapman, that's all right.
I don't need a seat.
Oh. Well, I do.
I'll take 2 for the concert.
Oh, that concert.
That's what I wanted to speak to you about.
I was wondering, would you care to take my wife to the concert tonight?
I'm afraid I can't.
I've decided
I'd better go to the hukilau.
The hukilau?
Well, if you can't make it,
I'll just have to go to the concert by myself.
Yes, Mr. Chapman.
Huh. Huk... hukilau.
Oh, my fish. I... yeah.
Yeah. Come on, boys.
Come on.
You girls, too. There.
Oh, Chad!
May I help you?
Oh, that's all right.
I'll help him.
No, we're OK.
We'll talk later.
Girls?
Patsy? Beverly? Sandy?
Come on.
Chad, why don't you go get some firewood for dinner?
Firewood?
Man, you'll eat anything.
Hey, watch it, man.
Isn't this a beautiful spot?
Lovely. Look at the palm trees.
Come on, ito, start the fire.
Do you want some help? What?
What are you trying to do, Ellie?
I did it.
Well, congratulations.
Didn't you like it?
Wait a minute.
Are you trying to get us both in trouble?
Do you want to kiss me again?
I want you to go back to the others and behave yourself.
Why? Afraid you might like it?
I don't rob cradles.
Did you ever see anything like this in a cradle?
Come here, Ellie.
Hold out your arms.
Now close your little eyes.
Take this to ito.

Whoo!
The last few days,
I don't know what time that boy's gotten in.
It must have been after 1:00 last night.
I woke up when I heard our dog barking, and I thought Chadwick was coming in then.
But then I realized it couldn't be, because we don't have a dog.
Are you listening to me, daddy?
Hmm? Oh, yes!
Oh, Ping Pong, my eggs are cold.
Take them back and warm them up, s'il vous plait.
Oui, oui, missy.
Morning, Mr. Chadwick.
Hi, Ping.
You want some cold eggs?
No, thanks.
I'll stick to juice and coffee.
Thank you.
Good morning, Mom, Pop.
Morning, Chadwick.
You got some sugar for your mama this morning?
You're up early this morning, young man.
Have to, Pop.
I got a job.
A job? Working?
Sure.
For the last 3 days,
I've been a full-fledged employee of the Hawaiian tourist guide service.
Oh, Chadwick, how could you?
I thought you wanted me to work, Mom.
Oh, not as a common employee.
Acting as a messenger boy for a group of tourists when you could follow in your daddy's footsteps, wind up as the vice president of the Great Southern
Hawaiian fruit?
I fail to comprehend you, Chadwick.
I like my job, Mom.
It's fun, it's interesting, and I meet a lot of nice people.
Nonsense!
Tourists aren't people.
They're...
They're tourists.
Easy, Sarah Lee.
I'm very sensitive.
Hi, Jack.
Morning, Jack.
Good morning.
Tell me, Chad, where does another tourist meet these nice people you talk about?
Why don't you try the island inn?
They're having a luau tonight.
Boy, I am late.
I've got a meeting with the grievance committee this morning.
Want to sit in, Jack?
Not me.
I'm on vacation.
Could you drop me off, dad? Sure.
Where's your car, son?
I don't need it.
I can drive the company car.
Bye, Mom, Jack.
Bye, mother.
See you tonight.
Jack.
Fred.
Land!
My son driving tourists around like a chauffeur!
It's a disgrace.
I don't know.
When you married Fred, he was just a chauffeur, driving bananas around in my old truck.
I'd rather drive girls than bananas any day.

Right this way, folks.

Ha ha ha ha!
Oh, you girls really shake that grass!
Mahalo.
Ha ha ha!
And you wanted me to go to chicago and visit your mother, Enid.
Wow!
Oh, Tucker!
Beautiful song.
It was lovely,
Chad.
They taught us that corny hula stuff in dancing school when I was 3.
You were never 3.
Mmm! It's good.
What's it called?
A mai-tai.
Here. You finish this one.
I'll order another.
Uh, Miss.
Miss, another of these little tummy-warmers.
Well, now, we got some real pretty company over here.
Ha ha! Howdy, ma'am.
I'm Tucker Garvey.
This is my wife Enid.
Say hello, Enid.
Hello.
We're from Tulsa,
Oklahoma.
Allo.
I am from Paree...
France.
Well, what you know?
I sure do like a pretty little French girl.
Say some more of that talk for me...
Fifi.
Je suis filet avec sole.
Oui, oui?
Chateau Frontenac...
Bi-i-ig boy.
Yeah! Ha ha!
Yeow!
Ooh! Ooh, so sorry!
I make ze big mistake.
I thought it was a pig's knuckle.
You better take it easy, Frenchy.
You are very brave, big boy.
Well, Fifi.
Ha ha ha ha!
Parlez-vous francais?
♪ Steppin' out of line, steppin' out of line... ♪
Yeah, let's dance.
Come on!
Come on, Frenchy.
Let's dance, huh?
No!
Hey, wait a minute!
Let me go!
Yeah, Frenchy.
Let's dance now.
I don't want to dance!
Aw, come on. You want to dance, don't you?
No!
You're going to dance.
Come on.
You're stepping out of line.
That's my business!
It's my business, too.
Ooh!
Thank you, duchess.
That was wonderful, young man.
How about dancing with me?
Thank you, ma'am, but we haven't finished eating yet.
Oh, come on, handsome.
Garvey, tell him to dance with me.
Yeah, boy, go ahead and dance with Enid.
You dance with her.
She's with you.
Oh, no. Not me.
I've been dancing with her for 15 years.
I'm gonna dance with Frenchy here.
Excuse me, Mr. Garvey.
I think you should go home and sleep it off, sir.
You watch who you're calling names, boy.
You're gonna wind up sleeping it off.
Now, go on. Get lost.
Sir, why can't we settle this...
Didn't I say move?
Chad, please!
Oh, go on.
Turn him loose, sis.
Turn that tiger loose.
Thump him, Garvey!
Thump him, Garvey!
Thump him a good one!
Garvey!
Get up, Garvey!
Get up!
Chad, look out!
Hit him for Fifi!

Hey, you!
Cork up the wailing.
I said cork it up!
Now, wait a minute. I...
Beautiful.
You guys sing beautiful.
I hope you get life with me.
Now, dad, I know how you feel about it.
I've posted your bail.
Let's go.
What about the other boys?
They'll be out in an hour.
I'm sure they all have sympathetic fathers like yours.
I'm very upset about this, Chad.
I know you are, but I couldn't help it.
I thought this tourist guide idea of yours would teach you some responsibility.
There he is!
I'll fix you, you'll see!
If you'd just be fair about this.
I'm sorry about your black eye.
There he is!
I've got him.
I've got him.
Lieutenant, arrest this man.
But he's just been released.
Released?
That's not right.
Not at all.
He's a violent boy!
Just a minute. I happen to be this boy's father.
Runs in the family, so watch it.
They may strike at any minute.
Oh, Mrs. Garvey!
Mrs. Garvey knows how wild he is.
She told me all about it.
Didn't you, Mrs...
Oh, my goodness!
You should never wear green with that eye.
Ow!
Who is this character, anyway?
This is my boss, dad.
Your ex-boss.
You're fired, young man!
Mr. Chapman, he was only protecting your clients.
You can't fire him.
Yes, I can.
I'll do it again.
Just watch me.
You're fired! You see?
Why don't you give me a chance to explain what happened?
I don't want any explana... I want the money. $700.
What for?
To cover for the damages your son caused.
What a mess it was.
I haven't got $700.
You haven't got...
Then your father will have to pay it!
I will not!
It's OK. The newspapers will be on my side.
What do you mean?
What newspapers?
The newspapers
I give the story to...
About how a guide from your tourist service got into a fight and everybody wound up in jail, including one of the tourists.
That's good, isn't it?
Yeah, that's good.
No, it's bad!
That's very bad for business.
I'll sue the newspapers.
That's what I'll do.
That's good, isn't it?
Yes.
That's good.
I'll waive the release and go back to my cell.
No, you won't.
He can't do that!
He's going to ruin my business.
I demand, Lieutenant, that you rel... release... whatever.
Send him home.
Just send him home, that's all.
He's free to go.
Come on, Chad.
Let's go.
Miss Duval,
I'll see you back at the office.
No, you won't,
Mr. Chapman. I just quit.
Ah, you think she...
Quit?!
You can't do that!
Yes, I can, and I'll do it again.
Watch.
I quit! See?
My baby!
Oh, my baby!
Oh, my baby's home from the big house!
Oh, Sarah Lee, will you forget those old movies?
Oh, you are all right, aren't you, Chadwick?
They didn't grill you under a lamp or anything?
No, Mom.
No grilling, no lamp.
I'm just fine.
I do hope this doesn't get back home.
Daddy, there hasn't been a Gates in jail since the revenuers caught your moonshining uncle squeezing corn.
He was your uncle,
Sarah Lee. He was a Polk.
Mom, I'm sorry, honestly, but it wasn't my fault.
Oh, I know that, dear.
It's your friends.
Mostly that Duval girl.
She's the one to blame.
Maile had nothing to do with it.
Well, she was there, wasn't she?
You got that job working in her tourist place.
Well, who else can we blame?
She's pulling you down to her level.
I won't listen to that kind of talk.
Then listen to this.
You've tried it your way, and you've made a mess of it.
Now you'll try it our way, and our way means no more beach friends and no more harebrained jobs.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yes. I can't promise
I'll go along with it.
If you remain in this house, you'll go along with it.
I'm sorry. You just made the decision for me.
Chadwick!
Think of who you are.
Remember, you come from a fine family.
You'll do enough remembering for both of us, Mom.
Oh, daddy!
What did we do wrong?
Offhand, I'd say we got married.
This is the life, isn't it?
How do you like being unemployed? I don't.
How would you like to be married? Are you asking?
Not till I know what the answer's going to be.
One more setback, and I'll establish a new record...
First man ever to lose a home, a family, a job, and a girl all in one day.
You were perfectly right in what you did. Yeah?
Chad, don't quit.
Bounce right back.
There's so much you can do.
Yeah. I can be a tourist guide.
Miss Prentace thought you were a good guide.
I saw her at the office when I picked up my things.
She really blasted
Mr. Chapman for firing you.
She canceled the rest of her tour.
She seems to think a lot of you.
I'm sorry about the tour.
I really think she was enjoying herself.
I know she was.
She's not taking the girls home, is she?
Unless she signs on with another guide service.
But I'm more concerned about your plans than hers.
- Maile, you're a wonderful girl!
- I am?
You're pretty, too.
Not only wonderful and pretty, you got a brain.
I'm so glad
I was able to help.
Bye. Take care of my board, OK?
- Where are you going?
- See Miss Prentace.
Miss Prentace?
We just made a deal to continue the tour.
Now, if you'll follow through...
Plane reservations and hotel accommodations at Kauai.
I'll do what I can.
By the way, congratulations.
Was she hard to convince?
Uh... Nah. She was all for the idea.
That's right.
3 days.
When I come back, we'll celebrate.
Good-bye, honey.
OK, girls, let's go inside.
Hello.
OK, girls.
Follow your luggage.
Isn't this beautiful?
Look at the palm trees!
And the bridge over the lagoon.
Yes, it's nice.
Oh, I'm going to like it here.
We'll meet in the lobby in half an hour, girls.
Beverly, you come with me.
We're rooming together.
Put on your riding clothes, girls.
I'll arrange for the horses.

That's for dinner, girls.
Ooh. I'm starved.
I could eat a horse.
Please, make it mine.
Shall we go in to dinner now?
We'll have to wait to be called.
Oh. Well, uh, who's going to call us?
That's the traditional
Hawaiian way of announcing that chow's on.
Oh!
Pretty impressive, huh?
Beautiful.
Indeed.
Shall we, ladies?
Mmm, yes.
Duchess?
Dinner is served.
Oh, this one and that one.
Did you tell Chad you were coming?
No. I want to surprise him.
Are you sure
Miss Prentace is staying at the same hotel?
I made the reservations myself.
You're almost as anxious to get to the hotel as I am.
I have business there.
So have i.
Here you are.
Hi, Chad!
What do you want?
Shh!
Uh-uh. Off limits. Back to your room.
I couldn't sleep there.
Well, you sure can't sleep here. You...
Whew! That perfume!
You ought to take a bath.
On second thought, you ought to take a cold shower.
Chad, I'm lonesome.
I want someone to talk to.
What about your roommates?
They're sleeping.
Well, that's where you should be... in bed!
I am in bed.
Uh-oh.
Hello?
This is Maile.
I just got in.
Oh, Maile.
You just got in where?
Here at the hotel.
I thought it would be a surprise.
S-s-surprise?
It... it is.
I mean, I'm glad you're here.
Are you receiving visitors?
Well, I was just getting ready for bed.
It's been a rough day, and I'm tired.
Am I getting the brush?
No, no.
No!
No.
I'll meet you in the bar in 5 minutes.
Well, then.
That's better.
Well, at least we have 5 minutes.
I have 5 minutes.
Your time is up, miss oversexed and underage.
I spent one night in jail on account of you.
That's when I knew.
Knew what?
When you fought with Mr. Garvey at that party, I knew you cared.
I wasn't fighting over you.
No? Don't you think
I'm worth fighting for?
I think you're a mixed-up kid that's too big for her britches.
I don't wear britches.
You're getting out of here right now, miss no-britches
Bardot!
Chad, do you think
I'm pretty?
I think you're pretty forward and pretty stupid.
Wouldn't you rather hold me than old Abigail?
I'd like to hold you over a barbecue pit.
Who is it?
Us! Patsy!
And Sandy!
What is this, game night at Coco Palms?
We've got to see you. It's important.
What are you doing here? We're looking for Ellie.
Has she been here?
This is my room. Out!
And that's my perfume!
And she's wearing my peignoir!
You're ruining my sleep!
That dirty little sneak!
Who's a dirty sneak?
You are!
You stole my perfume!
You're wearing my peignoir!
Shh! Keep quiet, girls!
Ellie was just leaving.
I don't care what she's doing, but not in my peignoir.
Don't you dare!
You've got a lot of nerve!
Go back to your room.
Shh! Shh!
Go back to your rooms and settle this.
I'll depend on you to explain to them what you were doing here and why you were here.
Everybody get out, please.
Uh, yes?
Abigail Prentace,
Chad. May I see you?
Just a second.
Girls, in the bed...
No, no!
Come on. Out here.
Hello.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
I've never been more disturbed in my life.
Oh? Well, this is irregular, I know, but may I come in?
Sure. Come on in.
We're having open house tonight.
I was so restless,
I went out walking in the moonlight.
Moonlight in Hawaii can be rather intoxicating.
Yeah, I know.
That's why I never touch the stuff.
I just had to talk to someone.
Whatever it is, this is the night for it.
Chad? I'm not as young as you might think I am.
Oh?
Not old!
But a little older than you... not that that should make a difference.
No. It doesn't make any difference.
You know, I've taken a vacation every summer, looking for... well... romance.
An attractive girl like you shouldn't have any trouble finding romance.
Thank you.
I'll get quickly to my point.
When Miss Thackery first asked me to chaperone the girls on this trip,
I accepted eagerly.
I thought it would insulate me against this frustration.
Yeah.
But instead, Chad, it's happened.
What's happened?
I've found romance.
You have?
Ellie!
Ellie!
Ellie! Ellie!
Chad...
I just can't keep it a secret.
This is most unexpected.
To me, too, Chad.
Excuse me.
Open up! Chad! Chad!
Chad, Ellie's gone!
She stole the Jeep! What?
She drove off like a maniac!
Calm down!
Which way did she go?
The front gate.
Up the highway!
That crazy kid.
I'll get a car and see if I can catch her.
She went so fast, we couldn't stop her.
Ellie!
Ellie!
Ellie!
Ellie!
Oh! Oh!
Leave me alone! Let me go!
Stop it, Ellie!
I hate you!
Oh! Let me go!
I'm trying to help you!
Oh! Let go!
Let go of me!
Stop it!
Listen to me.
Stop this!
Stop it!
Why did you have to stop me?
Nobody cares about me... whether I live or die.
Nobody seems to care because you don't seem to care about yourself.
You have to care first.
If you like yourself, others will, too.
There's nothing to like.
There's a lot to like if you wouldn't try to be something you're not.
It don't work. I know.
You better find out now and save yourself a lot of grief.
Everybody hates me.
Nobody hates you.
No? Then why do my parents always send me away... to school all year, on trips every summer?
And you... you threw me out of your room.
You didn't throw
Abigail out.
You know what you need?
A good old-fashioned spanking.
M-maybe I do.
Nobody ever cared enough about me... even for that.
All right, Eleanor.
If that will prove that somebody does care... you wouldn't dare!
Wouldn't I dare?
Wouldn't I?
Oww! Oww!
I've got a feeling this is going to make both of us feel an awful lot better.
Aah! Aah!
Mmm, these hot cakes are good.
They're delicious.
Ellie, pass the guava jelly, please.
Here, Bev.
Gesundheit.
That's a good way to see how many friends you got...
Sneeze, and then count the gesundheits.
Ellie, I hope you didn't catch a head cold last night.
No, ma'am.
Just the opposite.
Maile, you haven't touched your breakfast. Aren't you hungry?
I don't have much of an appetite this morning.
Oh? Are you feeling all right?
As a matter of fact,
I'm not, Miss Prentace.
I didn't sleep very well last night.
I had rather a restless night myself.
Perhaps you should get some rest instead of going riding with us today.
Maile!
We'll meet out front in 20 minutes, girls, and don't be late.
Oh, we won't,
Miss Prentace.
We'll be there.
We promise.
Chad, I'd like to talk to you.
About last night?
Yes. I didn't get a chance to finish what I was telling you.
Miss Prentace,
I'm not the guy you think I am.
I snore and everything.
Aloha!
Jack!
Jack!
Abbie! I've been looking all over for you.
Hi, Chad. I didn't want to disturb you last night.
This is what
I've been trying to tell you.
You mean you and Jack?
Yes!
Congratulations...
To both of you!
Well, thanks.
It's great.
It's just great.
Look, fella,
I've got my girl.
What I just saw of yours,
I'd say you got a few things to straighten out.
Where did she go?
Last time I saw her, she was headed for her bungalow.
Oh, I missed you.
Just great.
You don't know how great it is.
Oh, he's a nice boy.
I hope things work out for him.
He'll have to take care of his girl himself.
Maybe I can give him a hand with his other problem.
Come on.
Operator.
You look wonderful.
Operator, get me
Mr. Fred Gates on Oahu.
The Great Southern
Hawaiian Fruit Company.
Hi, honey!
You're in the wrong room, lover boy.
Look, I'm sorry about last night.
I got tied up with...
With Miss Prentace!
I saw you.
I could try to explain what happened, Maile, but nobody would believe me, not even me.
Would you just believe this? I love you.
There's nothing between
Miss Prentace and me.
Of course you deny it, but I know that look, and she's got it.
That look is for Jack.
He's got it, too.
Mr. Kelman and Miss Prentace?
Oh, you can do better than that.
You must think
I'm a fool!
Look, Maile...
Don't touch me!
Get out!
Men...
You can have them!
I don't want them!
Get out!
I want you!
Lonnie, 3 mai-tais.
Yes, sir.
Dad, what are you doing here? Hello, son.
I sent for him.
It's time you two got things settled.
Settled?
Sit down.
Do you mean to say that you dragged me all the way over here just...
What are you doing here anyway?
I'm here on business.
Well, that's a welcome change.
What kind of business?
Dad, I've been doing a lot of thinking.
You and mother wanted me to work for the company.
Do you still want it?
Yes. Your mother and I both want that very much.
And you, Jack?
Nothing would suit me better.
That leaves me.
What do I want?
I want independence, a chance to prove
I can stand on my own... which seems to rule out working for the company.
But I think I figured a way to do both... work for the Great Southern
Hawaiian Fruit Company and Chad Gates.
How many salesmen you have, Jack?
- Oh, I don't know.
- Scattered all over the states, right?
- And Canada.
Every year, you have your annual sales meeting in Atlanta.
- They all come, don't they?
- Most all.
Have you ever thought of how much they would look forward to a trip to Hawaii?
You could bring them over here, show them how we grow the fruit, process it, let them get a firsthand taste of Hawaiian sunshine, and they'd go back to their territories and sell like they never sold before.
Fred, I think the boy's got something.
And also special incentive trips.
Any salesman who goes over his quota gets a week's holiday here, all expenses paid.
Why, that's a crackerjack notion.
I'll put you in charge of the whole program.
I don't want that, Jack.
I want to go in business for myself with Maile.
That's my declaration of independence.
I wondered where
I fit into this.
- Maile, sit down.
- Hello, Maile.
I'm giving great
Southern this idea.
I expect them to give us the tourist business.
My partner will figure out the costs and draw up a program for your approval, ok?
You've got a deal.
Chad,
I'm proud of you.
Lonnie, 4 of those little tummy-warmers over here.
Yes, sir.
How do you feel, partner?
Proud and happy.
"Gates and Duval
Travel Service." has a nice ring to it.
It's too long. Simple.
"Gates of Hawaii."
Don't I get any billing?
Sure. Gates is plural.
In case you didn't recognize it, that's a proposal, and that has a better ring.
You're sure?
I suppose I could be romantic about it, but you'd say yes anyway.
You're pretty sure of yourself.
Isn't it about time?
Missa. Missa Gate.
Uh, Mr. Gate...
Mr. Gate on line for you.
Oh, merci beaucoup,
Ping Pong.
Hello? Hello, daddy?
Sarah Lee, pack your things.
You're coming over to Kauai.
Kauai?
What on earth for?
Don't argue with me,
Sarah Lee!
You better hurry over here, or you'll miss your son's wedding.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Everything ok, Mr. Gate.
Missa Gate just taking nap,
s'il vous plait.
And did you know that my daughter-in-law is of royal blood?
She's the direct descendant of King Kalaniopoopoo of Hawaii.
Kalaneaupuhuu.
Uh, yes.
Our southernmost island, you know.
Yes, I know. I am her grandmother.
Uh, yes.
Um...
Here they come.

Why do you think
I have a personnel man?
Why do you think I have a whole damned Personnel Department?
Son, you bumped into the wrong man.
Damn, damn, coal-burning, dithering, ding, ding, ding...
You just committed industrial suicide, boy.
That's the big fellow.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Did you hurt yourself when you fell?
- No, no, I'm all right.
- Oh, I know how hard it is to...
- What?
I said, I know how hard it is to find a job.
- I've been through that myself.
- Thank you, you're very kind.
- Tell me where the personnel office is.
- Personnel?
- Yes.
- It's right there.
- Thank you.
- Well, listen...
- What?
- You mean you're not discouraged?
No, not at all.
I'm prepared for this sort of thing.
My friend Smitty works in Personnel.
Maybe she can help you.
- She's here somewhere. I'll find her.
- No, look...
- Wait right there.
- That's not necessary.
You don't have to go through all...
- Where are you going?
- To see the personnel manager.
I'm the personnel manager.
We're not hiring.
- I was just speaking to Mr. Biggley.
- Biggley?
- Yes, sir.
- J.B. Biggley?
Yes, sir. He told me to see you.
You were speaking to J.B. Biggley himself?
- Yes, sir. I just bumped into him.
- He's a friend of yours?
Sir, I don't think a man should trade on friendship to get a job.
By George, I like a man who stands on his own two feet.
- My name is Bratt. You're?
- Finch, sir. Pierrepont Finch.
Pierrepont. Come in, Pierrepont.
You know, maybe that ought to be "J. Pierrepont Finch."
As a matter of fact, sir, it is.
Good God, Rosemary, you could at least let me finish my Metrecal.
What's the big urgent urgency?
Oh, he has that woebegone look.
A puppy dog.
Well, you can just tell he'll never get anywhere.
I just figured you could introduce him to...
- Where did he go?
- Where the hell should I know?
Rosemary, what's got into you?
Why is this creep any different from all others?
He's not a creep.
Smitty, he has a sort of undaunted sort of noble courage...
...yet deep down you sense he's a helpless little muffin.
- The man in the manhole cover.
- That's rich, a good one.
Well, it's all settled then.
Nice to have you aboard, Finch.
I'm happy to ship out with you, really.
You don't have a match?
Yes, yes. Let me do that for you.
- Is that the...?
- The helpless little muffin.
My secretary will fill out the forms.
- Smitty?
- Yes, Mr. Bratt?
- This is our new Mr. Finch.
- Hello.
- My name is Rosemary Pilkington.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Lucille Krumholtz.
Mr. Finch will be starting in our mailroom. Glad you don't mind that.
In a big pond like this, everyone must begin as a little fish.
- Even a barracuda.
- What did you say?
Bud, have you guys in the mailroom sent those new wicket catalogues yet?
I don't know, I'm going to the barbershop to get a scalp massage.
At this time of the morning? Why?
Because I'm the boss's nephew.
- Excuse me.
- Oh, Bud.
Bud Frump, Mr. Biggley's nephew.
Say hello to our new Mr. Finch.
He'll be working with you in the mailroom.
Oh, hello, Finch.
I'm Bud Frump, Mr. Biggley's nephew.
- Hello, how do you do?
- Smitty.
- Yes, Mr. Bratt?
- Get Mr. Finch's vital statistics.
- Yes, Mr. Bratt.
- Nice to have you on the team, Finch.
- Good to be playing with you, sir.
- Are you ambitious, Finch?
- No, not necessarily.
- Good. You just keep that in mind.
You just remember who I am and who you are, we'll get along fine.
- If not...
- You'll go crying to your uncle.
I beg your pardon!
I do not go crying to my uncle.
It just happens that my mother is Mrs. Biggley's sister.
If I feel that something's wrong,
I phone my mother.
She phones Mrs. Biggley, and Mrs. Biggley phones Mr. Biggley.
That's the democratic way.
You don't have to worry about Bud Frump.
Every company has a couple of relatives floating around.
Smitty, you were going to get Mr. Finch's vital statistics.
Yes. Now, Mr. Finch, the first question...
- Are you married?
- Married? No, I'm not.
- And I don't even have a girlfriend.
- Good.
I mean it's very good you answered with the right answer.
- For the questionnaire.
- Yes, it is.
- It's not very wise to have a girl.
- No, it isn't.
Glad you understand, Miss Pilkington.
Some women wouldn't see.
I feel that when a man wants to rise in the world of business...
...a girl or, well, let's say an emotional involvement...
...can only lead to getting involved emotionally.
- What the heck was that?
- That's very intelligent, Mr. Finch.
- Are you quite finished with Mr. Finch?
- For the moment.
- Irving.
- What?
Take Finch to the mailroom and introduce him to Mr. Twimble.
You can fill in the personnel forms later.
- Come on, Finch.
- Okay.
Oh, well, good luck, Mr. Finch.
Thank you, Miss?
Pilkington. Rosemary Pilkington.
Pilkington. Rosemary Pilkington.
Come on, Finch.
Poor baby.
He looks so utterly vulnerable.
We'll eat him alive in this jungle.
- Coffee break!
- Well, it's about time.
Don't argue with me.
Just take care of the executive mail.
- That's all you've got to take care of.
- Look, I'm doing the very best I can.
Don't argue with me.
Just get the executive mail out.
- That's all you've got to worry about.
- Yes, sir.
Lemon drops? Where did these lemon drops come from?
Oh, they're mine, Mr. Twimble.
I just thought I'd share them with our mailroom family.
- But lemon is my favourite drop.
- Oh, well, I'll be darned.
- Finch?
- Yes, sir.
I've been watching you this first morning here...
...and I'd like to say
I'm very pleased with your work.
Thank you, sir.
That's exceptionally kind of you.
You know, well, I try to fit in.
No, no, it's more than that, Finch.
You have an inborn gift for mailroomery.
Well, thank you very much...
Excuse me, sir.
Hello, mailroom.
Hold the line.
Mr. Twimble, it's for you.
It's Mr. Bratt from Personnel.
This may be a very important call for some of us. Hello?
Good morning, Mr. Bratt.
- Oh, yes, yes.
- What's the idea?
- What's the idea of what, Bud?
- You.
Trying to butter up Mr. Twimble.
Believe me, it won't do you good.
Just because I'm being nice to an older man...
I know what you're up to.
If anybody...
Got you, Mr. Bratt.
Thanks very much.
Well, boys, it looks as if they're finally gonna promote...
...old Twimble to the Shipping Department.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Yeah, congratulations.
But who's gonna be new head of the mailroom?
Mr. Bratt is gonna leave the choice to me.
"Twimble," he said:
"The mailroom is the nerve centre of this mighty organization.
You've been an outstanding mailroom head.
We want you to choose your successor.
And we want you to choose him on merit.
On merit alone."
Now, that's not fair.
- I'm going out to have a smoke.
- Smoke.
He's gonna call his mother.
Well, it won't do him any good.
Bratt said I was gonna select the new head of this department.
- Mr. Twimble.
- Yeah?
You've been with this company a long time, haven't you?
A long time. Last month,
I became a quarter-of-a-century man.
- Beautiful. Quarter of a century.
- Quarter of a century.
- How long have you been in mailroom?
- Twenty-five years.
It's not easy to get this medal.
It takes a combination of skill, diplomacy and bold caution.
When I joined this firm
As a brash young man
Well, I said to myself
Now, brash young man
Don't get any ideas
Well, I stuck to that
And I haven't had one in years
- You play it safe.
- I play it the company way
Wherever the company puts me
There I'll stay
- But what is your point of view?
- I have no point of view
- Supposing the company thinks...
- I think so too
- Well, now, what would you say if...
- I wouldn't say, I wouldn't say.
Your face is a company face
It smiles at executives
Then goes back in place
- The company furniture
- Oh, it suits me fine
- The company letterhead
- A valentine
- Is there anything you're against?
- Unemployment.
When they want brilliant thinking
From employees
That is no concern of mine
Suppose a man of genius
Makes suggestions
Watch that genius
Get suggested to resign
Oh, so you play it the company way
All company policy is by me okay
- You'll never rise up to the top
- But there's one thing clear
Whoever the company fires
I will still be here
- Oh, you certainly found a home.
- It's cosy.
Your brain is a company brain
The company washed it
And now I can't complain
- The company magazine
- Boy, what style, what punch
- The company restaurant
- Every day, same lunch
Their haddock sandwich, it's delicious.
- I must try it.
- Early in the week.
- Do you have any hobbies?
- I've a hobby
- I play gin with Mr. Bratt
- Mr. Bratt?
- Do you play it nicely?
- Play it nicely
Still he blitzes me
In every game like that
- Why?
- Because I play it
- The company way, yes.
- The company way
- Executive policy...
- Executive policy is by me okay
- How can you get anywhere?
- Junior, have no fear
Whoever the company fires
I will still be here
You will still be here
Year after year after fiscal
- Never take a risk all year!
- Never take a risk all year!
All right.
I'll get this out as soon as I can.
Not as soon as you can.
I want it by noon, Miss Pilkington.
Yes, sir.
Well, hi, do you work for Mr. Ovington, Miss?
- Pilkington.
- Pilkington.
- You can call me Rosemary.
- Okay. Hi, Rosemary.
- Hi. How's it going, Mr. Finch?
- Oh, why don't you call me Ponty?
Okay, Ponty, I like that.
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.
I'm delivering the executive mail.
Sort of getting the feel of the place.
But everybody's so busy, they don't even notice me.
- They will, Ponty, you just be patient.
- Patient?
Do you realize that I've been working here for about two full hours now?
I know, Ponty, I haven't forgotten...
- Oh, here.
- What?
Happy two-hour anniversary.
Thank you.
Well, at least you noticed me.
- Well, I wish I were an executive. I'd...
- Mr. Andrews.
- Here comes the mother of us all.
- What?
Miss Jones, Mr. Biggley's secretary.
Meeting may be delayed 10 minutes.
I'll check with J.B.
Thank you very much.
- I'll see you later, Rosemary, all right?
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Ponty.
Pardon me, ma'am, but you should be wearing this.
It goes with your hair.
- Young man.
- Yes?
You just want me to have this flower?
- Don't know who I am?
- It doesn't matter.
What matters is the flower.
It seemed to cry out to be worn by you.
- Young man.
- Yes?
I'm Miss Jones,
Mr. J.B. Biggley's secretary.
- Oh, no. No, you couldn't be.
- Why not?
Well, from Bud Frump's description of you...
...I'd never have... I mean, well, you...
- You're not a frightening person.
- Thank you.
And if it's not out of place for me to say so, Miss Jones...
...I think you're an attractive person...
...no matter what Bud Frump says.
- What did you say your name was?
- Finch, F-l-N-C-H. Finch.
- Pierrepont Finch.
- Why haven't I seen you around before?
I'm not supposed to deliver the executive mail.
That's his job. Bud Frump.
F-R-U-M-P.
Thank you for the flower.
You're a very interesting young man.
- You're welcome.
- Hey, Jonsie.
I'd like an appointment with the boss at 3.
I'll check his calendar, Milt.
Flowers.
Got a new boyfriend, Jonsie?
This was given to me by a very nice young man.
- You should know him, Finch?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Finch, this is Mr. Gatch.
- How are you, son?
- How do you do?
- Mr. Gatch is a good man.
- His department is very important.
- I know all about Mr. Gatch.
He's the manager of executive personnel placement.
Wonderful memo that you put out this morning, sir...
...about that executive personnel placement service.
- You read the memos?
- Well, now...
- Your name is?
- Finch, F-l-N-C-H.
Yes, C-H.
Say, Jonsie, this is a smart one.
We'll have to keep an eye on him.
That's a very fine man, Mr. Gatch.
I hear, he has a fine opening in his department.
Yes, but he hasn't been able to make up his mind.
Well, again, thanks for the flower, young man.
You're welcome.
- I caught you. Give me that.
- What are you doing?
Fellow can't go out to smoke without getting stabbed in the back.
- That's the executive mail.
- Executive mail's my job.
- Mr. Twimble told me...
- If you have any ideas...
...about climbing the ladder, the view is gonna get awfully monotonous.
Every time you look up, you're gonna see the seat of my pants.
- Hiya, Jonsie.
- Miss Jones to you, if you don't mind.
Mr. Biggley's office.
One moment please.
- Yes, Miss Jones, what is it?
- Your wife is on line two.
Tell her I'm busy, I'm in a meeting.
Tell her I'm out.
Damn it. Put her on.
Hello, Gertrude, what's on your mind?
- Dear, I want to talk to you about Bud.
- I'm busy.
- Now, Jasper, this is important.
- What is it this time?
He heard there's an opening in mailroom management.
I can't help Bud there.
The head should choose his successor.
- You're the head of the company.
- I can't switch signals during a play.
- It'd upset the team.
- You could.
- If I interfered, it'd be nepotism.
- It would be what?
- Nepotism.
- What's nepotism?
That's when your nephew is a damn poop.
- Now, look, Jasper...
- All right, I'll do something.
Damn, damn, coal-burning, dithering, ding, ding.
- Miss Jones.
- Yes, Mr. Biggley?
Talking to my wife upsets me.
- You said to put her on.
- Never mind, I need to calm my nerves.
Where is my, you know?
I put it in the back
of your right-hand drawer.
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Here it is.
Congratulations.
You have followed instructions...
... and have made it
to the first rung of the ladder.
You are working in the mailroom.
One word of caution
about the mailroom:
It is a place out of which
you must get.
Well, Twimble, we've got great news for you.
- Yes, Mr. Bratt?
- Boys, boys, gather around.
Boys, as of today, your boss is being promoted...
...to head of the Shipping Department.
All right, boys, back to work.
Back to work.
- Now, let's talk about your successor.
- Say, Mr. Bratt, Mr. Bratt.
- Have you heard from my uncle today?
- No, Bud.
Your shoes are going to be hard to fill, but who have you picked to fill them?
Mr. Bratt, I've given it a good deal of thought, and I think this is our man.
- Congratulations, Finch.
- I'm going out for a smoke.
- Thanks. No, I can't accept.
- Are you turning this job down?
Yes, sir. I think there's a man who's better qualified.
A man who has been here longer than I have.
- I recommend Bud Frump for this job.
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.
- Bud Frump?
As long as he feels strongly about Bud,
I'll go with the recommendation.
Oh, I've gotta call my mother.
She'll be so happy.
- I don't understand.
- Yes. Well, Mr. Twimble, let me explain.
Knowing you has taught me a lot about the corporate setup.
Hello, mailroom.
Oh, yes, J.B. This is Bratt.
That's the big boss.
My sister-in-law has been calling my wife.
- Giving me a bad time about Frump.
- I understand your problem, J.B.
We had picked someone else, but it turned out fine.
The young fellow we picked turned the job over to Bud.
He thinks Bud's better qualified.
No, he doesn't seem to be out of his mind.
He was explaining it when you called. Go ahead.
Look, the great thing you've taught me...
...is no individual is as important as the whole company.
He says no individual is important.
The whole team is greater than any single player.
The whole team is greater.
The whole crew is greater than any one oarsman.
The whole crew is greater.
Whole salad is larger than one piece of lettuce.
Whole salad... You can hear him?
The whole omelette is larger than one egg.
Isn't that great, J. B?
Sort of chokes you up, doesn't it?
- His name is Finch.
- F-l-N-C-H.
F-l-N-C-H.
I was just going to say the very same thing, J.B.
We should keep an eye on that young lad.
Oh, yes, nice to chat with you, J.B.
See you later.
Oh, Finch, you got me off the spot with Mr. Biggley.
- Well, I'm glad to be of help, sir.
- Oh, that feels good.
Well, Twimble, good luck in the new job, sir.
- Thanks, Mr. Bratt.
- Keep up the good work.
Mr. Twimble, don't I have to take this mail up to Mr. Gatch?
- Gatch?
- Gatch.
- Gatch.
- Gatch.
I just remembered something.
Gatch is looking for a bright young fellow...
...to fill a junior executive vacancy in his department.
- He is?
- Finch...
...I'm going to talk to him about you.
You know, Finch, your generosity and thoughtfulness...
...may have proven a good thing for you.
Well, by George, ethical behaviour always pays, sir.
Boys and girls! Boys and girls!
I want you all to meet the new head of the mailroom, Bud Frump.
I still think my original choice was better.
Now, wait a minute, Mr. Twimble.
Ponty okayed it.
Now, come on, everybody, it's a celebration.
We're all gonna go have lunch, and it's on me.
May I have your attention, please?
I have an announcement to make.
Mr. Gatch is taking young Finch into his department as a junior executive.
Hey, wait a minute. Hey, just a minute.
The lunch is Dutch.
In fact, it's cancelled.
Hey, wait. Oh, no! Put me down!
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, Ponty, that's wonderful.
See, I told you to be patient.
You sure were right, Rosemary.
Well, you should have someone around all the time...
...to help you think things out.
- Well, yeah, maybe I should.
- Well, Ponty, I'm always available.
Listen, you sure are wonderful,
Rosemary...
...and one of these days I really hope I can show my appreciation.
Lunch. I said lunch.
- What about lunch?
- I'd love to.
- You'd love to what?
- You said, "What about lunch?"
Thought you'd never ask.
Let's see, where should we go?
There's a little tearoom.
Very cute place called The Hungry Tea.
It's very reasonable. I'll get my things and meet you at the elevator.
Rosemary, look, I didn't mean what about lunch?
- I meant what about lunch?
- Hey, there, Finch, come along.
- I'll show you to your new desk.
- Lunch...
Finch, if you work hard, keep your nose to the grindstone...
...there's no telling how far you can go with this company.
By the way, this will be your desk right here.
All right, men, your attention, please.
I'd like you to meet the newest member...
...of the junior-executive pool,
J. Pierrepont Finch.
These are the fellows you'll be working with.
Hi.
Come, I'll buy you lunch in the executive dining room on the roof.
- Wanna have lunch, Rosemary?
- No, thanks, I'm busy.
- Okay, see you later.
- Okay.
Hey, Matt.
The most wonderful thing has happened.
Mr. Gatch is taking me to eat with him up in the executives' dining room.
Can we make our date some other time?
- Oh, well, sure Ponty, anytime.
- Well, hey, how do I look?
- Well, you look fine, fine.
- Oh, you look fine too.
Just fine.
You have a good time, okay?
Oh, thank you.
Well, I know, but those wickets ought to be shipped.
Yeah, Rosemary, seeing you always brightens my day.
Please, Mr. Gatch!
I'll have to stop reading Playboy.
If you have followed the simple
instructions exactly as outlined...
... you should by now
be a junior executive.
Congratulations.
- Good Morning, Mr. Big Shot.
- Hello, Mrs. Needleman.
- New suit, huh?
- Yeah.
You have now occupied
this position long enough.
The time has arrived for you to set
your sights on your next escalation.
Be alert.
Oftentimes, it is someone remotely
connected with your company...
... who may launch you
into your next promotion.
Mr. Biggley's office.
He's busy on another line.
Who's calling, please?
Yes, yes, but damn it, Gertrude...
...I haven't time for this nonsense about Bud.
Yes, I know that blood is thicker than water...
...but Bud Frump is thicker than anything.
I'll promote him when I'm ready.
Listen, the next time
Bud complains to his mother...
...and she calls you and you call me, you're all fired.
Damn it.
- Yes, Miss Jones. What is it?
- Young lady on line three, Mr. B.
She insists on speaking to you.
Says it's personal.
What does she want? I can't talk to every silly woman who calls.
- What's her name?
- She said you'll know.
Hello? Oh, you knew I wouldn't forget.
I'll take care of everything.
Just a moment.
Miss Jones, get me Bratt in Personnel right away.
You see, it's all set.
Come in anytime you like.
Ask for the personnel manager.
His name is Bratt.
He'll take care of everything.
Goodbye.
Bratt? This is J.B.
I'd like you to do me a favour.
I wonder if you could find a spot for a young lady.
She wants to be a secretary.
She's an old friend of the family.
Her dad was a classmate of mine at Old Ivy.
She's a bright girl, got a good head on her shoulders.
Her name? LaRue.
Hedy LaRue.
May I help you, honey?
Screw.
Did you wish to see someone, miss?
Oh, how do you do?
I'm supposed to see a Mr. Bratt.
- I'm a secretary.
- I spotted that the minute she came in.
- Oh, Miss LaRue.
- Yes?
I'm Bert Bratt...
I'm Bert Bratt, Personnel.
- Sorry to have kept you waiting.
- Oh, not at all, sir.
It is I whom am late.
Oh, no, not really.
Oh, yes. I was very naughty this morning.
I'm still not accustomed to early arisal.
Oh, I understand.
Well, why don't we move up to my office, Miss LaRue.
Excuse me.
I hope you didn't have trouble finding the building?
The taxi dropped me right off downstairs.
Miss LaRue, this is my secretary, Miss?
- Smith.
- How are you, dear?
Oh, fine, dear.
Mr. Bratt, I have to go down to Accounting and get...
- Mr. Bratt.
- Yes, Smitty?
I have to go down to Accounting and get some withholding blanks.
Yes, yes, yes, you do that, Smitty.
Just through here, Miss LaRue.
- And we'll get all your vital statistics.
Oh, I win the pool.
Yeah, you always do. Look, Bert,
I really need a new secretary.
Miss LaRue will be assigned according to office procedures...
...as soon as her qualifications have been determined.
- I'll determine them.
- Count me in.
- Remember me, I'm your buddy.
- Gentlemen!
A secretary is not a toy
No, my boy
Not a toy
To fondle and dandle
And to playfully handle
In search of some puerile joy
No, a secretary is not
Definitely not a toy
You're absolutely right, Mr. Bratt.
We wouldn't have it any other way, Mr. Bratt.
It's the company rule, Mr. Bratt.
A secretary is not a toy
No, my boy, not a toy
But do not go jumping for joy
Boy, a secretary is not
A secretary is not
A secretary is not
A toy
A secretary is not to be
Used for play therapy
Be good to the girl you employ
Boy, remember no matter what
Neurotic trouble you've got
A secretary is not a toy
A secretary is not
A toy
And when you put her to use
Observe when you put her to use
That you don't find
The name Lionel
On her caboose
A secretary is not a thing
Wound by key, pulled by string
Her pad is to write in
And not spend the night in
If that's what you plan to enjoy
No
The secretary you got
Is definitely not
Employed to do a gavotte
Or you know what
Before you jump for joy
Remember this, my boy
A secretary is not
A tinker toy
Be sure that I call Kimball at my Texas office...
...first thing Monday morning.
Push that board meeting up to 10:00.
Call Mrs. Biggley, tell her
I won't be home for dinner.
Yes. You left your golf clubs in the office.
Tomorrow you're playing golf with the chairman of the board.
Yes, I'm staying in town.
I'll come pick up the clubs in the morning.
You asked to be reminded about your college alumni association.
Send them that same check.
I get a kick out of thinking of their faces when they get that check...
...from old
"Least Likely To Succeed."
Oh, J.B., there's a phone call for you.
- Your wife.
- My wife? Damn it.
I'll take the call in your office.
That's all, have a good weekend.
- Thank you. Same to you, sir.
- Hi, Miss Jones.
Hello, Ponty.
How's the young junior executive?
Just fine, thanks to helpful advice that, well, I've been getting from you.
Glad our little talks have proved valuable.
They sure have. Good luck tonight.
The bowling tournament.
I hear you're the best bowler on the company team.
How sweet of you to be interested in a little thing like that.
Oh, well, I'm fascinated by the hobbies of people that I like.
Would you like to come watch us bowl tonight?
Well, gee, I'd love that, but I should get to bed early.
See, I have to work tomorrow.
- On Saturday?
- Yes.
Ponty, you're a very unusual boy.
You'll go far.
Miss Jones, that means a lot, your saying that.
You're Mr. Biggley's secretary...
...and he's the man that I most want to emulate.
And he's so capable, and he's thoughtful.
I heard him remembering to send a check to his old school and all.
- Harvard, isn't it?
- Harvard?
Don't ever let J.B. Hear you say that.
He's a Groundhog.
But where did he go to college?
- Old Ivy.
- Old Ivy.
- They're the Groundhogs.
- Groundhogs.
- Good night, Ponty. See you Monday.
- Groundhogs.
- With the pin curls.
I can't believe her.
- Hello, stranger.
- What?
- Oh, hi, Rosemary.
- Hi, Ponty.
- Hello, Ponty.
- Yes.
- Look, I was won... Maybe...
- Good night, Rosemary.
Good night, Brenda.
See you Monday.
- Well, it's been a long day, hasn't it?
- Yes, it has. It's been a long day.
Haven't seen much of you since you got your new job.
Oh, yes, well, you know, I've been...
I've been punching pretty hard.
It's a new job and all.
- Oh, sure.
- Lot of new people to meet, you know.
- Good night, Rosemary.
- Oh, good night.
- Good night, Smitty.
- Good night.
- My...
- What?
- It's been a long day.
- Oh, yeah, really long.
Oh, it has been a long one.
- Say, Rosemary?
- Yes?
Where are you having dinner tonight?
- I don't know, that depends.
- On what?
On where I'm having dinner.
Oh, no.
Well, here it is 5 p.m.
The finish of a long day's work
And there they are, both of them
The secretary and the clerk
Not very well acquainted
Not very much to say
But I can hear those two little minds
Ticking away
- Now she's thinking:
- I wonder if we take the same bus?
And he's thinking:
There could be quite a thing
Between us
- Now she's thinking:
- He really is a dear
- And he's thinking:
- But what of my career?
Then she says:
And he says:
Well, it's been a long day
Well, it's been a long
Been a long
Been a long
Been a long day
Now she's thinking:
I wish that he were more of a flirt
And he's thinking:
I guess a little flirting won't hurt
And now she's thinking:
For dinner we could meet
And he's thinking:
We both have got to eat
Then she says:
And he says:
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.
Well, it's been a long day
Well, it's been a long
Been a long
Been a long
Been a long day
Hey, there's a yummy Friday special
At Stouffer's
It's a $1. 90 vegetable plate
And at the bottom of the ad
Not bad
Service for two, 3. 58
To make a bargain
Make a date
- Wonderful.
- It's fate.
Now she's thinking:
What female kind of trap
Could I spring
And he's thinking:
I might as well forget the whole thing
Now she's thinking:
Suppose I take his arm?
And he's thinking:
Well, really, what's the harm?
Then she says:
You hungry?
And he says:
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Well, it's been a long day
Well, it's been a long
Been a long
Been a long
It's been a long day
Well, it's been a long
Been a long
Been a long
Been a long day
- J. B...
- Blithering, blathering.
Calling your mother.
She wants you promoted.
Well, why not?
Other people are being promoted.
- I told your Aunt Gertrude...
- Oh, there you...
- Good evening, Mr. Biggley.
- Good evening, Miss LaRue.
Uncle Jasper, I want...
I told you never to call me that around here.
Haven't you something to do?
- I was gonna get my hat and go home.
- Good, do it.
How do you like your new job,
Miss LaRue.
- It's a big fat nothing.
- Don't talk like that here.
I thought you're gonna help me be a big business woman...
...like Helena Rubinstein or Fannie Farmer.
So, what happens? I'm stuck in the lousy stenographic pool...
...with no one to fish me the hell out.
But these things take time.
You have to learn.
Yes, in a large operation like World Wide Wickets...
...there are multiple facets which are very important.
- Hedy, I promise you...
- I give up a wonderful job.
Head cigarette girl at the Copa.
But I thought you hated all those men staring at you, making advances.
Well, it's no different here in big business.
At least at the Copa, when I got pinched, I got tipped.
Around here, a girl can't even bend down...
...to pick up a pencil with confidence.
Somebody has been bothering you?
Who? Just let me know who he is?
Yes, in a large operation like World Wide Facets...
...there are multiple wickets...
Who pinched you?
I don't care about that.
Look, you did not keep your part of my bargain.
But I meant every word. I'll tell you what, I'll meet you at your place.
- We'll talk everything over.
- No.
But, angel... Yes, Miss LaRue, in a large operation like...
- Why don't you go home?
- I'm waiting for the elevator.
- Why don't you walk down?
- It's 30 floors.
- Why don't you jump?
- Oh, J.B.
- A very attractive girl, Miss LaRue.
- Yes, she is.
I was just trying to put her at ease.
- She's a very shy person.
- Oh, yes.
Well, you just go ahead, J.B.
I'm meeting mother for dinner.
Mother just loves having dinner with me.
I tell her everything that happens, all day, at the office.
Now he's thinking:
The kid could really put me
Through hell
- And she's thinking:
- The kid could even name the hotel
- Now he's thinking:
- I wonder if he'd dare
- And she's thinking:
- There's blackmail in the air
- And he says
- It's a hold-up.
- And she says
- Down.
Wait a minute.
Okay, you're promoted.
Well, it's been a long
Been a long
Been a long
Been a long day
Well, it's been a long
Been a long
Been a long
Been a long day
Really, I mean it.
You've got to see this.
This is my older sister, Bernice.
- The one that got married at 17.
- Great.
And that's Sam and his seven children.
- Yes, seven?
- Too many?
- No, I didn't say...
- Not enough?
- No, I didn't say anything about...
- You don't like children?
Actually, Rosemary, I come from a rather large family myself.
I know, six.
How did you know that?
Smitty had your personnel file out, and she was checking off a few things...
Maybe we better order.
Maybe we better order.
Okay.
Actually, it's incumbent on big corporations to find bright young men.
- I suppose you're right.
- But it's very difficult to do that.
- How'd you like those vegetables?
- The vegetable plate? It's delicious.
I do my carrots in a bouillon with a dollop of Worcestershire.
And it's just great. I would really love you to come up and have it sometime.
What was I talking about before the dollop?
Well, you take the average young person today.
I mean, the trouble is, they're looking for instant poetry...
...instant psychoanalysis, instant mashed potatoes...
...and instant old-fashioned love.
I mean, they don't realize that it takes...
Takes time to establish a meaningful relationship.
- Don't you agree with that, Ponty?
- Well, no.
I agree with some of that, Rosemary, but in the world of business l...
I see no reason why a person has to wait...
...years to become a success.
I don't know, in the world of business where older, more sophisticated...
- What's the matter?
- This is where I live.
I've got my key in here someplace.
Here you go.
- There.
- Thank you.
You'd better give me those.
That has keys to my desk.
I've lost it twice, and for the last...
Oh, here, here, let me.
Oh, let me get those for you.
Thank you. I love to curl up in bed with a good magazine, don't you?
Rosemary, this is the darnedest thing.
You're the first girl that I've met that I feel that I can trust.
I mean, anyone who can curl up in bed with Fortune and Business Week...
...well, that's substance.
- Thank you.
- Listen, I wanna... Here.
I want to thank you for a very stimulating evening.
I've been enjoying myself so much with you...
...that I forgot that I was depressed.
- Depressed about what?
I've been working so hard and trying to do my best at the company...
...and I don't even have my own office yet.
Oh, Ponty, you've only been working there two days.
Yes, but...
I feel I'm never gonna get anyplace.
Ponty, some men spend years trying to accomplish...
...what you've just done in two days.
Yes, but I'm 27 years old and I'm only a junior executive.
I'm not getting any younger.
- You've got a wonderful career ahead.
- No.
I've lost the vision.
Well, I haven't.
Now, you listen to me,
J. Pierrepont Finch.
You have the cool clear eyes
Of a seeker of wisdom and truth
Yet there's that upturned chin
And the grin of impetuous youth
Oh, I believe in you
I believe in you
I hear the sound
Of good solid judgment
Whenever you talk
Yet there's the bold, brave spring
Of a tiger that quickens your walk
Oh, I believe in you
I believe in you
And when my faith in my fellow man
All but falls apart
I've but to feel your hand
Grasping mine
And I take heart
I take heart
To see the cool, clear eyes
Of a seeker of wisdom and truth
Yet with the slam, bang, tang
Reminiscent of gin and vermouth
Oh, I believe in you
I believe in you
- Rosemary.
- Yes?
You've given me a great idea.
Good night, Rosemary.
I'll see you Monday at the office.
Good night.
Good morning.
Oh, my gosh.
Is it morning already, sir?
Good heavens, have you been working all night?
Yes, I just...
I had some work I had to finish up.
- I shouldn't be here much longer, sir.
- By George, your name escapes me.
- Finch. F-l-N-C-H. Finch.
- Oh, yes, Finch.
I've been hearing good things about you.
Thank you very much, sir.
It's good to see a man today.
Makes me feel guilty.
I just came in to pick up my golf clubs.
Have to play a couple rounds with Wally Womper.
He's chairman of the board.
I suppose we all have to do that sort of thing once in a while.
- I'll just get those clubs.
- Right, sir.
What's that you're humming?
I didn't realize that I was humming, sir.
You were humming the Old Ivy fight song.
Did you go there?
Were you a Groundhog?
- Well, sir...
- Say you're proud of it.
- You're not ashamed of Old Ivy?
- No, sir, not a bit.
That's the Groundhog spirit.
I should have known you're Old Ivy.
- What year?
- What?
- When did you graduate?
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I was thinking about the game today.
I'm sorry I have to miss it.
- We're playing the Chipmunks.
- I know. I can't make it, either.
I hope those damn Chipmunks don't give us trouble.
No, I think we'll take them, sir.
Charnowsky's knee, you know...
Now, it's, well, much better.
Yes, with Charnowsky back in there, the team's morale should pick up.
He's the dirtiest player we've got.
Yes, and even though we're not there in person...
...we'll be rooting for them, right?
- Right.
- Groundhog!
- Groundhog!
Stand Old Ivy
Stand firm and strong
Grand Old Ivy
Hear the cheering throng
- Stand Old Ivy
- Stand Old Ivy
- And never yield
- And never yield
- Rip, rip, rip
- Rip, rip, rip
- Rip the Chipmunk off the field
- Rip the Chipmunk off the field
- When you fall on the ball
- When you're down there
- At the bottom of the heap
- Down at the bottom of the heap
- Where the mud is so very, very deep
- Down in the cruddy, muddy deep
- Don't forget, boy
- That's why they call us
They call us Groundhog
- Groundhog
- Groundhog
- Stand Old Ivy
- Groundhog, Groundhog
- Stand firm and strong
- Rip, rip the Chipmunk
- Grand Old Ivy
- Grand Old Ivy
- Hear the cheering throng
- Hear the cheering throng
- Stand Old Ivy
- Groundhog, God bless you
- And never yield
- And never yield
- Rip, rip, rip the Chipmunk
- Rip, rip, rip the Chipmunk
- Off the field
- Off the field
- I enjoyed that, sir.
- So did I.
- I'll go along and get my clubs.
- Yes, sir.
- Goodbye, Finch.
- Have a nice day, sir.
- What's that you're doing?
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I just want to, you know, finish this row.
I guess this looks pretty silly...
...but, well, I find that knitting helps me think more clearly.
- Well, I'll be damned.
- Yes.
- I knit too.
- You knit? You do?
Yes, I've been doing it for years.
I find it's good for my nerves.
- What's this going to be?
- Oh, yes, well, I thought I'd...
Well, I thought I'd make...
...a birdcage cover.
- A birdcage cover?
- Yes.
Never made one of those.
How do you like this?
Goodness, that is gorgeous.
Really, it's beautiful.
I did it all myself. I made the covers for the golf clubs, pom-pom stitch.
Isn't that...? What work.
That's lovely. Oh, gosh.
You know, Mr. Biggley, I don't...
You know...
I feel sorry for men who don't knit.
They lead empty lives.
I like the way you thinch, Fink.
- No, it's "think, Finch."
- Think, Finch. Think, Finch.
Where are you headed around here?
What's your ambition in this outfit?
You must have it all figured out.
I don't know.
I'd like to be where a man...
...could get his teeth into something where he could...
...do something real, solid, you know, down to earth.
I'd like the Advertising Department.
- Advertising?
- Yes.
I wouldn't want that for a schoolmate.
Too rough, too insecure.
Why, we've had 15 new advertising managers here in the past year alone.
The poor devils disappear about one a month.
- Why is that?
- I fire them.
- Sir, if you had a man with ideas...
- Ideas? That's what I look for.
I keep hiring a lot fellows who are supposed to have brilliant ideas...
...but not one of them will ever do what I tell him.
Stick to what you're doing.
You'll do all right.
Damned fine department.
Where are you?
Where am I? I'm... Where am I?
What is it? Mr. Gatch's department.
Damn fine man, Gatch.
Knows what he's doing.
- Stick with him. I'll keep an eye on you.
- Thank you. Have a wonderful day.
- I have to finish this before midnight.
- Midnight?
- Midnight.
- That's the Groundhog spirit.
- Groundhog.
- Groundhog.
- Stand Old Ivy
- Stand Old Ivy
- And never yield
- And never yield
- Rip, rip, rip the Chipmunk
- Rip, rip, rip the Chipmunk
- Off the field
- Off the field
- Good morning.
- Good morning. How do you feel?
A little fuzzy, but don't worry about me, I'll be fine, sir.
- Keep up the good work.
- Thank you.
Stand Old Ivy
Stand firm and strong
Rip, rip, rip...
Why don 't we have lunch someday, Finch?
Off the field
- Good morning, J.B.
- Damn it, Bratt.
What are we running, a sweatshop?
- A sweatshop?
- We're working that boy too hard.
- Who?
- Who? Finch, F-l-N-C-H.
- Finch...
- He worked here all weekend.
- All weekend?
- I ought to know.
I was with him working side by side.
- I had no idea.
- The lad needs help.
But first, I want him to have an office of his own.
- An office?
- He deserves the best.
- I'll get on it.
- Nothing fancy.
- Don't want him getting any ideas.
- No.
J.B., I'd like to talk to you about...
So long. I'll never forget this junior executive pool.
I've spent some of the happiest minutes of my life here.
Where's Mr. Finch?
Ponty, you've got your first office, and it's just beautiful.
- Thank you.
- Here.
Oh, that's sweet. Oh, here.
Please, please, sit, sit.
- Oh, thank you.
- What do you think?
I mean, it's not bad, considering.
You know, I did want my name on the office door...
...but I decided not to ask because there's no door.
- Well, it's beautiful and it's yours.
- Oh, yes.
Listen, Ponty,
I just came by to tell you...
...that I had a real good time the other night.
Oh, me too. Listen,
I enjoyed the conversation.
- I guess I talked too much.
- Well, I liked it.
- But just one thing sort of bothers me.
- What?
About what happened later.
I mean, when we said good night.
I know it was our first date...
...and I don't want you to get the wrong impression of me, but...
Well, I guess it's only natural for a fellow...
...to try to get a little fresh with a girl and make a pass at her...
...but you didn't do anything.
Well, I had to get up early.
Sir? Miss?
I'm Miss LaRue, honey.
Yes, well, I don't...
What can I do for you?
A secretary was ordered to be assigned to you.
I'm your assignation.
You didn't tell me you were getting a secretary.
I just found out myself.
I don't know...
- Rosemary.
- Well, happy dictation, Ponty.
Bye.
Rose...
- Won't you sit down, Miss LaRue?
- Thank you.
Yes.
- Yes, now, Miss LaRue...
- Oh, just call me Hedy.
Well, yes, but I think that, perhaps, you know, in a business relationship...
- You're cute.
- Excuse me a moment.
Choosing the secretary
can be fraught with peril.
Take a good look at the young lady
who has been assigned to you.
If she is so attractive that you feel
things are too good to be true...
... be very careful.
It may be that one of the big men
in the company...
... is interested in her career.
There's a simple test for this.
Check on her secretarial skill.
The smaller her abilities,
the bigger her protector.
Yes.
Miss LaRue, let's try some dictation.
Take a letter for me.
- Shoot.
- Yes. This is to Mr. Gatch.
Dear Mr. Gatch...
Pursuant...
...to our discussion of...
- Wait, you're trying to catch a train?
Miss La... Hedy, what...?
- What are you taking this down in?
- Longhand. It's safer.
- I make up for it when I type.
- Oh, I see. You type fast?
Like a jackrabbit.
Twelve words a minute.
Hedy, tell me something.
I'd like to know, what, now...?
What was your last position?
- I was in the tobacco business.
- Tobacco.
- Then Mr. Biggley...
- Biggley?
- Got me interested in wickets, so I matriculated myself...
...into business school, and here I am.
- Yes, you are. Yes.
- Go ahead, dictate some more.
- I'm gonna like this job.
- Miss LaRue... Hedy.
Put the letter aside for a moment.
I want you to do me a favour.
- I have a very important job for you.
- Good.
I want you to take this into Mr. Gatch, right?
- Mr. Gatch...
- Now, Mr. Gatch, he's my boss.
- Yeah.
- Wait a minute.
I want you to give it to Mr. Gatch himself.
All right, Hedy? Did you get that?
Fine.
Hedy.
- Personally.
- Okay, Charlie.
- Mr. Gatch.
- Yes?
I'm Mr. Finch's secretary.
He asked me to give you...
...this.
Miss, miss, miss.
Hey, what are you doing tonight?
I've got a date with my gentleman friend.
No, come on, you're in the big time now.
Don't fool around with small fries.
Hello, Mr. Finch's office.
It's Production Department.
Hello, Finch.
No, I'm running Executive Personnel
Placement Department now.
Oh, you wanna speak to Mr. Gatch?
Well, no, he's been transferred to one of our out-of-town offices.
Venezuela.
Very well then, it is time now
to look to your next step up the ladder.
This is an important step.
Weigh carefully the next position
you want to obtain.
- Take a memo for me.
- Just straightening up your desk.
That'll wait. This is a memo to all departments.
"We are reassigning
Mr. J. Pierrepont Finch...
...to the Advertising Department.
Signed, Manager,
Executive Personnel Placement."
Who put through this assignment?
I didn't order any help.
- Who are you anyway?
- Finch, sir. J. Pierrepont Finch.
I decide if this department needs replacement personnel.
If I need them, I pick them.
Me, personally.
Some silly boob sends you a memo and just dumps you into my lap...
- Watch it, will you?
- Excuse me. Hi, Rosemary.
What are you playing?
Musical Offices?
I can't explain now, but I can't have lunch with you...
Finch! Are you listening?
Yes, sir, Mr. Ovington.
I heard every word you said.
Who the hell transferred you here?
The manager of executive personnel placement.
- Who's he? What's his name?
- No, he's not there anymore.
- He's been transferred to...
- Damn system.
- Damn corporate procedures.
- I agree with you, Mr. Ovington.
It's criminal the way they shift personnel without checking.
But I just want to say, sir, since they've made...
...this dreadful reassignment,
I promise you...
I promise I'll do my best to make you happy with me, sir.
Oh, really.
It is planned so that it will take in all countries in Europe and Near East.
Here we have Cairo and Gambia...
Hedy.
- Personally.
- Okay, Charlie.
- Hello there.
- Who sent you with this?
- What happened?
- He wants to see you personally.
- Sit down, Finch.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
Yes?
Finch, I've been watching you for these last two days.
- Like to know my appraisal of you?
- Well, yes, I would, sir.
Finch, you remind me of myself when I was a young man.
- Well, thank you very much.
- But before you try to take my job...
...I'm firing you.
Firing me?
I've put the papers through and notified Personnel.
You'll get the normal two weeks' severance pay and the party.
I've scheduled your farewell party for tomorrow on the rooftop garden.
I think that's everything, Finch.
Spend the rest of the afternoon cleaning out your personal belongings.
Goodbye, Finch.
- Don't you feel...?
- Goodbye, Finch.
Ponty, I'm terribly sorry.
I really don't know what to say.
He just fired me. Just like that.
Everyone is just shocked.
Absolutely stunned.
You were advancing so nicely.
I don't understand it.
He was so dispassionate and cold.
He's...
He's the only one that I could never get an angle on.
Look... Look, you're his secretary.
You must know one weakness that he has.
One... Some little angle that I could work on. Some...
Ponty, I swear to you, we hardly know him.
No one knows anything about him.
He's the mystery man.
Yes, but what about his personal phone calls?
No, he has a private telephone he keeps locked up in a cabinet...
...and his personal calls never go to me or the switchboard.
You'd have to be a fly on the windowsill to learn anything about him.
But I want you to know that
I'd do anything in the world to help.
Say that again.
I said, I'd do anything in the world to help you.
No, before that, what did you say?
I said, you'd have to be a fly on the windowsill.
Yeah.
It should be de-accentuated.
I am very disappointed in you.
- He missed the whole point.
- He always does.
- Here's a new approach.
- Well, that is more...
Would you leave me alone for a few moments?
- Yes.
- We'll be outside.
We'll be outside, sir, if you need us.
Hello, yes?
I've been waiting for your call.
Yes, tonight.
I'll see you right after work.
Toodle-oo.
All together now!
Chipmunks! Chipmunks!
Rah-rah-rah!
Chipmunks! Chipmunks!
Sis-boom-bah!
Chipmunk! Munk!
Chipmunk! Chipmunk!
Ovington, I'm not a bigot.
I've hired men from all colleges.
Tigers, Bulldogs, Trojans, Bears,
Gophers, Badgers.
But never, never a Chipmunk!
You may call the shots around here.
But the important thing is we Chipmunks...
...murdered you Groundhogs in last Saturday's big game.
- Easy.
- Get him out of here!
- Easy J.B.
- Chipmunk, rah! Chipmunk, rah!
Chip, chip, chip, chip, Chipmunk!
- Get...
- That's all right, take it easy, J.B.
That was a narrow squeak.
Imagine, a Chipmunk working here in the building.
It was a big shock to me when I found out.
Good thing you're on the ball when it comes to advertising.
What are we gonna do for a new advertising manager?
It could be fate you discovered this before Ovington fired you.
- Why, sir?
- You've always wanted this job.
- You think you could handle it?
- I don't know. I've never had...
One thing I admire on a man, it is humility.
I'm making you vice president, in charge of advertising.
- Vice president?
- Easy, J.B. I don't wanna question you.
Finch is bright, but he's had no experience.
- I like him!
- I like him!
We like him!
Listen, listen, listen.
The farewell party is ready, J.B.
Up on the roof everybody.
Well, hurry, before the ice melts.
See you up there, Ponty.
You're right.
- Why is Finch smiling?
- Haven't you heard?
- No, I don't wanna hear.
- To hell with you.
- Ovington's out, Finch is in.
- I knew I didn't wanna hear.
I knew I didn't want to.
Boys and girls, your attention please.
Most of you know that this was to have been...
...a farewell party for Mr. Finch.
I'm happy to inform you that Mr. Finch is still with us.
Not only still with us, but he is the new vice president...
...in charge of advertising.
Let the fun and merriment continue.
On with the dance.
I told you, that's my boy!
Who wants to dance with Hedy LaRue?
I don't think she's feeling too well.
Have Bud take her home in the car.
- Hey, buddy Bud, let's dance.
- No, no, no, Hedy, no.
J.B. Says you're to take
Miss LaRue home.
- Why?
- She doesn't feel well.
- Okay. Come on, Hedy, come on.
- I feel fine.
No, you feel terrible.
- Finch.
- Oh, yes, sir?
- How's it feel to be a vice president?
- Well, sir...
It's one of the biggest challenges that I've ever had.
We've hit on something here.
This boy is loaded with ideas.
Ideas? Tell us about them, Finch.
- What have you got, Finch?
- Yes, let's hear your ideas.
- Yes, speak up, son.
- Where are all those ideas?
- Well, sir, l...
- Put up or shut up.
Get on the ball or you're out.
Well, when I present my ideas to you, sir...
...I want to present a whole clear-cut campaign...
...not just, you know, one little silly little idea, sir.
- Well thought out, Finch.
- The board meeting is set for Monday.
Finch could present his whole clear-cut campaign at that time.
- By Monday?
- I'll give you 48 hours...
...to come up with your advertising presentation.
Better get going, Finch.
You are now vice president in full charge of advertising.
Frankly, up to now,
I'm pretty dissatisfied with your work.
- Oh, I love this floor.
- Hedy, no, it's the wrong floor.
Come on, Buddy, let's play a game.
Catch me if you can.
I don't think this is very funny.
There's a cab waiting downstairs.
I've got to take you home.
Look, a telephone. Upsy-daisy.
Hello, I'd like a double martini, please, with two olive...
J.B. Says you have to go home.
No, no, no, I'm not going home.
I'm going to J.B.'s office...
...because he has a private shower, and I'll take a nice cool shower...
...and then I'll feel fine, and I'll come back to the party.
- Cha-cha-cha.
- A shower. A shower.
Yeah. Hey, why don't you do that?
You go take a nice shower in J.B.'s office, huh?
Oh, thanks, buddy Bud.
You know, you're cute.
You're not as cute as Finch, but you're cute.
Cha-cha-cha.
That's the most murderous thing
I ever heard.
Come on, girls.
I'll buy you another drink.
J.B. Wants you to go down to his office in two minutes.
I was just with J.B.
He didn't say anything.
There's something big in the wind.
He doesn't want to talk about it here.
Now, he said it's very important.
Well, I've never seen
J.B.'s office anyway.
Well, thanks, Bud.
Guess who.
- Mr. Biggley.
- Surprise.
Hedy, what, what...?
What are you doing down here?
I came down to take a shower because I got a little drunkie up there.
- I'd better get back...
- What's your hurry?
- It is much more fun down here.
- Look, I think I should get back...
Don't you wanna stay down here with me?
- J.B.'s coming...
- Cha-cha-cha.
Cha-cha-cha. Listen, please, he's gonna walk in that door.
- I've been watching you.
- I'm sure you've been watching...
- You're a cutie pie.
- Yes, Hedy...
If you want my opinion, you're going places.
Well...
Yeah, Venezuela.
Hedy, please, listen...
Wouldn't J.B. Die if he came in and found you kissing me?
- I'd rather he didn't...
- Come on, let's try it.
- Hedy, no kisses! He's gonna walk...
- You don't kiss me, I'll tell J.B. You did.
Okay, look, just once and then...
Rosemary
Listen, listen. Can't you hear it?
Rosemary
- Rosemary?
- That kiss!
- What about that kiss?
- I don't know. Rosemary.
Finchie, thinking of two broads in the middle of one kiss is dirty.
I'm sorry, Hedy, something must have happened.
I don't know. I can't explain.
Finch, you are in love!
Yes, you're right.
You're right, Finch is in love.
It's like music all around me.
It's like a symphony.
I must've been in love with her all along.
You found out you're in love with Rosemary by kissing me?
Yes. Yes.
It is a far, far better thing I do than I have ever did before.
Suddenly there is music
In the sound of your name
Rosemary
Rosemary
Was the melody
Locked inside me
Till at last out it came?
Rosemary
Rosemary
Just imagine
If we kissed
What a crescendo
Not to be missed
As for the rest
Of my lifetime program
Give me more of the same
Rosemary
Rosemary
There is wonderful music
In the very sound
Of your name
Ponty?
I heard Bud talking at the party.
Where is she?
Rosemary, the most wonderful thing has happened.
- What are you talking about?
- Can't you hear it?
- I don't hear a thing.
- It's all around me.
- It's like a beautiful pink sky.
- Look, Finch, have you lost your...?
Rosemary, darling, will you please marry J. Pierrepont Finch?
Now, I hear it. I hear it.
Gee, I've been so wrapped up and, I know, just trying to get ahead...
I just never realized. It's as though
I'm seeing you for the first time.
Hi, Rosemary.
What's the matter?
- Rosemary.
- Don't let me keep you. Go on!
Go back to making love to her!
Take her home for the weekend!
All right, now what will I do?
Let's do what she said.
- Hedy, will you please stop...
- You, get back to the shower, hurry!
- Get back in there.
- I have nothing to hide!
Oh, yes, you have, and you keep it hidden.
- You snake! Kiss me!
- Let me explain...
- Kiss me!
- What are you talking about?
I beg your pardon.
I thought I was looking...
- Bud Frump saw...
- It's all my fault, Mr. Biggley.
I insisted that Mr. Finch show me your office.
I see.
Actually, I just came in to...
To wash up.
Excuse me.
- Finch, I guess I owe you an apology.
- You do, sir? For what?
Never mind, but I want you to know
I don't approve of what you were doing.
I don't care for that between an executive and a secretary.
But Miss Pilkington won't be my secretary until Monday.
That's a good point.
- You can come out now, girls.
- Hedy, really...
Rosemary, I want to thank you so...
I wanna thank you for...
Rosemary, where are you going?
- I never wanna see you again.
- Listen, don't you understand?
- You're going to be my secretary.
- I wouldn't.
If wild horses dragged me,
I wouldn't be your secretary.
- I'll take the job.
- Hedy, I would love that.
I really would...
...but Rosemary is going to be my secretary.
Now, listen to me, hey...
...I can explain everything about Hedy, about everything.
Don't you understand,
I've just been made vice president...
...in charge of advertising.
You know what a tough job that is.
Now, hey... And I can only do it if I have your help.
Rosemary, I need you.
Well, when you put it that way.
I guess I'll wait for that pigeon until after he's married.
- Sure a lot of whispering going on.
- It's the merchandise mafia at work.
Since Finch became vice president, they're all scared out of their wits.
Human nature.
They can't wait for him to lay an egg.
- What time is the big meeting?
- Four-thirty.
So you are now a vice president.
You have climbed the ladder
of success rung by painful rung...
... until you've almost scaled the top.
You have done beautifully...
... unless you are vice president
in charge of advertising.
In that case,
you are in terrible trouble.
There is one thing that can save you.
You must get a brilliant idea.
Now, the quickest way
to get a brilliant idea...
... is to steal someone else's.
- Hi, Ponty. I had to talk to you.
- Hi, Bud.
Hey, first time I've seen your new office.
Quite a layout.
My favourite style,
Chinese Provincial.
- I want you and me to be friends.
- Bud, now, come on.
- You know, smoke a peace pipe?
- Look, will you...
- You never liked me.
- Bud, now, don't...
Don't deny it, it's true, and I don't blame you.
- I've been a no-good, back-biting fink.
- Bud, I think that puts it a bit strong.
How would you put it?
- I guess your way is best.
- I wanna change all that.
- I know you're stuck for an idea so...
- I'm not stuck for an idea.
- I know you're stuck.
- I'm not.
- I know you're stuck.
- I don't need...
- Giveaway shows are back in vogue...
- I don't need anyone else's...
What did you say about a giveaway show?
I have this dandy idea for a giveaway program.
- Giveaway program?
- Yeah.
It's called the World Wide Wicket
Treasure Hunt.
Treasure hunt?
We hide a thousand-dollar savings bond somewhere.
And each week on television, we give clues to where it's hidden.
- Like you say, you don't need an idea.
- I really don't.
Let me leave it with you.
When you get a chance, look it over.
Because the meeting is in a few little while.
I mean, it's soon.
What did your uncle say when you told it to him?
I haven't told it to J.B.
He wouldn't listen.
That's why I brought it to you.
- You never mentioned it to your uncle?
- No, Ponty.
Bud, how can I believe that?
If you're not interested, that's one thing...
No, all right, I'll...
Well, I'll give it a bit of a think-think, you know.
- Mull it around a bit.
- Feel free to use it.
Treasure hunt.
- Are you pregnant or something?
- Hedy, I told you never to come to...
I did not intend to embarrass you.
- I just came for a business purpose.
- Business?
I wish to tender you with my resignation.
Resignation? I can't believe it.
Why would you do this?
- Hedy, you can't do this to me.
- J. B! J. B!
- I'm sorry.
- What the hell do you want?
You remember the television idea
I told you about? The treasure hunt?
I told you what I thought of that stupid idea!
- Just reminding you that you hate it.
- Out!
- You do hate it.
- I said, out!
I'm going! I'm going! I'm going!
What is this resignation nonsense?
Where are you going?
I don't know. All I know is
I am clearing out of here.
I am beginning to rot in that secretarial pool.
Not one person will use me as his secretary.
They stay away from me like I had an extremely tropical disease.
Be patient.
I promise we'll find a spot for you.
Promises, promises, promises.
But no action!
No, no, no. I am fed up with that secretarial pool.
I'll give you 24 hours.
After that, it's goodbye, wickets...
...hello, somebody who can do me something for real!
Hedy, on my word of honour as a gentleman...
...I promise you'll be out of that secretarial pool by tomorrow.
You better, or else.
Executive washroom.
Yeah, we're all down here.
The meeting is at 4:30.
Come on down, we'll make plans.
- Big meeting's today, huh?
- Yeah.
- Hear anything about Finch's plan?
- J.B. Set the board meeting.
He must have come up with something.
I'm getting a little afraid of Finch.
Me too. If we don't stop him pretty soon...
He'll have us all working in the mailroom.
- Good luck to us.
- Hi, men.
Hi, Bud. Did you hear anything?
- Chaps, our worries are over.
- What do you mean?
I'm so happy I could cry.
Finch is going ahead with...
- What?
- Believe me, he's dead, dead, dead.
- I'm glad to hear that.
- I don't know.
Finch has a way of bouncing.
I wouldn't believe he was dead if I read his obituary.
- You may be right.
- Ordinarily, I'd agree with you.
Finch is very smart.
But let's not forget that he's now in advertising...
...and that does something to men's brains.
Fred. Fred, I'll see you at the bus stop.
Has anybody seen my Wildroot Cream-Oil?
Hi, men.
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi, Finch.
- All set for the big meeting?
- Well, could be. Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
- Go get them, baby.
- Good luck.
- All the best.
Lots of luck.
Gotta stop that man
I gotta stop that man
Cold
Or he'll stop me
Big deal
Big rocket
Thinks he has the world
In his pocket
Gotta stop, gotta stop
Gotta stop that man
That man
Now, there you are
Yes, there's that face
That face that somehow I trust
It may embarrass you
To hear me say it
But say it I must
Say it I must
You have the cool, clear eyes
Of a seeker of wisdom and truth
Yet there's that upturned chin
And the grin of impetuous youth
Oh, I believe in you
I believe in you
I hear the sound
Of good solid judgment
Whenever you talk
Yet there's the bold, brave
Spring of the tiger
That quickens your walk
Oh, I believe in you
I believe in you
And when my faith
In my fellow man
All but falls apart
I've but to feel your hand
Grasping mine
And I take heart
I take heart
To see the cool, clear eyes
Of a seeker of wisdom and truth
Yet with the slam, bang, tang
Reminiscent of gin and vermouth
Oh, I believe in you
I believe in you
Gotta stop that man
Gotta stop that man
Or he'll stop me
Big wheel, big beaver
Boiling hot with front-office fever
Gotta stop, gotta stop
Gotta stop that man
Oh, I believe in you
Don't let him be such a hero
- I believe in you
- Stop that man
- Gotta stop him
- You
Stop that man
Gotta stop him
- Stop that man
- You
- Gotta stop that man
- You
Gotta stop that man
I've gotta stop that man
Cold
Or he'll stop me
I believe in you
I believe in you
Right in here, boys.
Put the projection on the rack here.
Follow him. Good afternoon.
Gentlemen... Oh, thank you.
Gentlemen, I'd like to present my new approach to Wicket Advertising...
...which in my humble opinion...
I think it's brilliant.
- Sounds promising. Proceed, Finch.
- Thank you, sir.
What the hell is that?
That is a picture of Mount Vesuvius in eruption...
...which gives you an idea of the impact our new television show is gonna have.
Now, J.B., the type of national publicity...
...that you and, well, you alone can look forward to:
- The cover of TIME magazine
- Oh, yes.
- And cover of Newsweek.
- Delightful!
And finally, J.B., the golfer of the year.
- You've done it again.
- Thank you.
Now, gentlemen, this is a map of the potential Wicket market.
It's divided into social, geographic and ethnic groups.
- Ethnic?
- Ethnic.
It shows how you'll make deep penetration overwhelming saturation...
...into those areas which have long remained peakiest.
- I like this thinking.
- Now, this is a sales chart.
This is a sales chart of the past fiscal year...
...which reflects the disastrous effect of our former advertising policy...
...in terms of per capita consumption of wickets.
Now, note, gentlemen, the sharp decline...
...from normal regularity.
Down, down, down.
But this is what's going to happen to our sales...
...after my new television program seeps into the public mind.
Up! Up! Up!
Up! Up!
Up, and there you have it.
- I think you've done it, very good.
- Well, thank you, sir.
- Yes, yes, yes?
- Can I ask a question, J. B?
Not "Can I?" damn it, "May I?"
You went to college.
- May I ask a question?
- You may.
- What's his idea?
- You heard.
It's a television show, to give us penetration and peak reaction.
Don't you ever listen? Sounds great,
Finch, great. Doesn't it, men?
But what is his idea for the show?
I don't see why you have to be so damned negative.
The only things you ever come up with are lousy ideas like treasure hunts.
All right, Finch, what is the idea for the show?
- I don't think I'm going to tell it to you.
- What do you mean?
You know, J.B., look,
I've always thought of you...
...as a man of perspicacity and vision.
I mean, open to new ideas.
- But now, I don't know, I'm thrown.
- By what?
The way you talked to Bud.
About his idea for a treasure hunt.
You dismissed it.
Now, there are treasure hunts and treasure hunts...
...and at first, I thought Bud's idea was a rotten idea myself.
But, gentlemen, in the field of medicine there were men like Hippocrates...
...Louis Pasteur,
Sigmund Freud, Jonas Salk.
Gentlemen, they all had brilliant ideas...
...but it took modern technology to take all these ideas...
...and develop them into a great television program...
...like Dr. Kildare.
The public always loves a show where someone wins a lot of money...
...and the first one who comes up with a new...
...an unrigged, an unfixed way to give away something for nothing...
...is going to sweep the airways.
- It can't be done, J.B.
- It can't be done.
But if it could, wouldn't it create tremendous excitement?
- It can't be done.
- But if it could?
- It can't.
- But if it could.
Look, J.B., just for a moment, say it could be done.
- Now, what is your answer?
- I forgot the question.
I hate giveaway shows.
They lack dignity.
Please, be patient.
Gentlemen, the World Wide Wicket Treasure Girl.
- What is this?
- This is the secret ingredient.
It can't miss.
I'm combining greed with sex.
Go ahead, Hedy.
Hello there. I'm your
World Wide Wicket Treasure Girl.
- Each week, I'm going to give you a...
- Clue.
Clue to where the World Wide Treasure has been stashed.
- Buried. Buried treasure.
- Oh, yeah, buried.
This eye-patch gets me mixed up.
Yes, J.B., Miss LaRue is... Well, she's just helping me with the idea.
She will not be our regular Treasure Girl.
You see, actually, when we go on the air...
...we're going to need, you know...
We'll need a big name personality.
Someone like Elizabeth Taylor.
- Get Queen Elizabeth.
- This is an American program.
- This is insanity!
- Wait a minute.
Tell him off and get on with our regular business.
I'll handle this.
Will you gentlemen and Miss LaRue...
...leave me with Mr. Finch?
Sir, I can explain this, J.B.
- Wait a minute, that's not true at all.
- Not at all.
But, gentlemen...
Sir...
Giveaway show?
I'll have to mull this over.
Where's the treasure gonna be hidden?
Sir, this is a completely honest show.
Not even the Treasure Girl is going to know, you see...
...where the treasure is hidden.
I mean, whoever she may be.
I'm the only one who'll know, sir.
Don't you think I should know?
Yes. Well, I'm gonna hide
5000 shares of stock...
...in 10 World Wide Wicket buildings throughout the world.
Now... Well, now you know, sir.
But it just must be a secret between you and me.
Finch, you're a brilliant young man, but I'm afraid you've let us down.
You've missed the boat.
Haven't thought this out properly.
Why, sir, I don't...?
Tell me, why does this Treasure Girl have to be a big-name personality?
Right this way, sir.
First of all, I know you're very confused.
The dress rehearsal went exceedingly well.
Quiet, please. Five seconds to air.
I think you'll be able to see it all from here, sir.
Ladies and gentlemen...
... the World Wide Wicket
master of ceremonies...
... Mr. George Fenneman.
Ladies and gentlemen, the World Wide Wicket Company...
...whose slogan for over 100 years of service to your community...
...has been "A day without a wicket is like a day without sunshine"...
...brings you now, in living colour,
The World Wide Wicket Treasure Hunt.
Here with us tonight to ensure absolute integrity to our giveaway show...
...we welcome the distinguished
Supreme Court justice...
...Leland Anthony Howsmeyer...
...United States senator
Wellington Washburn...
...and Dr. Stanton J. Noble...
...of the American University
Advisory Committee.
And your job, gentlemen...
...to ensure an absolutely unrigged, unfixed giveaway of money tonight.
Good touch.
Nice tone of dignity and distinction.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for.
The World Wide Wicket
Treasure Girl!
Hello there! I'm your
World Wide Wicket Treasure Girl!
Hello!
I'm here to give you the first clue...
...to where 50,000 shares of stock are hidden.
Say, I'm beginning to wonder where the treasure is.
Yeah, Ponty, where is it hidden?
No, nobody in the whole world knows but J.B. And myself.
- Right, J. B?
- Right, Finch.
All right, Treasure Girl.
May we have the first clue, please?
- The first clue!
- The first clue!
- The first clue is...
- One moment, Miss Treasure Girl.
This man is carrying a Bible.
Will you place your right hand on the Bible, please?
No, your other right hand.
Do you swear there has been no fixing or rigging...
...in connection with this show?
- What's the matter with her?
- She looks surprised.
Yes, she is.
Hedy didn't know about this.
I wanted this part to be completely spontaneous and sort of unrehearsed.
That can be very dangerous.
Do you swear that you yourself...
...do not know where the treasure is actually hidden?
Is this a real Bible?
Yes, this is a real Bible.
You see, we're going to get into trouble.
Why, J.B., look, you and I are the only ones...
...who know where the treasure is hidden.
I mean, look, she doesn't know, does she?
- Time is slipping by.
- Does she?
Treasure Girl, the entire nation is waiting.
- I'll repeat the question.
- Look, nobody told me about this.
- Miss Treasure Girl...
- I do not wish to take a bum rap.
Miss Treasure Girl...
My mommy and daddy told me never to swear false witness against perjury.
I do know where the treasure is hidden.
I found out last night.
There is treasure hidden...
...in all the World Wide Wicket buildings right now.
Stop that. Everyone take his seat.
- Stop that. What are you doing?
- It's another treasure hunter.
This creep tried to sneak past me three times.
Take your hands off him.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, sir.
This creep is the chairman of the board.
Chairman of the board?
They all look alike to me.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Womper.
If you'll come with me,
Mr. Biggley's waiting in his office.
- Miss Jones, have you seen Ponty?
- No. Everybody's looking for him.
- Oh, poor baby. I've gotta find him.
- He was a nice boy.
But somebody's head has to roll.
How to handle a disaster.
In every businessman's career...
... there are times
when everything goes wrong.
This is a time
for maintaining a cool head...
... and following the one simple rule:
Put the blame on somebody else.
Oh, Ponty,
I've been worried to death.
Are you all right?
Where have you been?
I've been just walking the streets.
I've just been thinking, thinking, well...
- Oh, you've got a bruise on your head.
- I know. I know, I got it last night.
They... Well, they threw me out of a saloon.
Well, why'd they do that?
I didn't buy anything.
The brutes. Ponty, you're all right.
I was so worried.
- Everyone's looking for you.
- Yes, I'm gonna be all right.
But before they find me, I have to read up on how to handle this disaster.
- Read up? Well, what do you mean?
- Well, I might as well tell you.
See, before I came to this company, I was...
- What were you?
- I was a window-washer.
Then I came across this book.
"How to Succeed in Business."
It just must explain how to put the blame on someone else.
Ponty, you wouldn't. That's dishonest.
I mean, it was your idea.
Go in there and face the music.
You don't understand what's it's like in big business.
They'd fire me. I'd have to go back to washing windows.
Ponty, I couldn't love a man who wasn't honest.
If you don't make a clean breast of everything...
...I'll never have any respect for you.
Rosemary, look, it's no life for you being married to a window-washer.
Ponty...
...are you gonna go in there and face them honestly or not?
Goodbye, Ponty.
Rosemary, wait!
Rosemary, wait. Rosemary!
- Finch, you're wanted in J.B.'s office.
- I thought I'd wash up first.
- They want you now.
- That's what I figured.
Now, let me tell you, I realize that
I'm the president of this company...
...the man responsible for everything here.
So I'd like to state now that anything that happened is not my fault.
There's one bright side to this thing.
We've someone we can pin it on.
You'll soon see where the responsibility for this lies.
When Finch gets here,
I'll do all the talking.
This is a very slick youngster, Wally.
Here he is now.
- Mr. Biggley...
- I'll do the talking.
By the way, you haven't met Mr. Womper.
- This is the chairman of the board.
- How do you do, Mr. Womper?
No speeches. It's settled.
Sign a letter of resignation...
...in which you accept the blame for what happened.
- Rosemary.
- What?
All right, Mr. Biggley, I'll...
I'll be glad to sign the resignation.
- Is this one of your tricks?
- No.
Look, I 'm through with all that.
This firm has been pretty good to me, and I'm just gonna resign...
...and take the blame, and go back to what I did before l...
- Before I came here.
- What did you do, Finch?
I was a window-washer.
No kidding?
I started as a window-washer myself.
You were a window-washer?
What the hell did you think I was, a rail-splitter?
College man.
- So you were a window-washer?
- Yes.
- Call me Wally.
- Okay, Wally.
- Look, why don't you call me Ponty?
- Okay, Ponty.
It's been a long time since I had anybody I could talk to.
- How'd you go into this business?
- See, I had a book.
- Yeah, me too.
- Well...
It was a book on how to succeed in business.
My book was more useful. I booked bets for all the other window-washers.
Cleaned up a bundle.
Should've stood in that business.
Eight buildings are wrecked, our stock is down five points.
We're the laughingstock of the industry.
Oh, I know, Wally. It's ghastly.
Ponty, how did this happen?
I could understand a college man pulling a boner like this...
...but not no window-washer.
- Your idea about a treasure hunt...
- Hold it, Wally.
Look, if there's one thing that I won't do...
...is take credit for another man's idea.
Especially when he's the boss's nephew.
You never told me you hired your nephew.
Nephew? Nephew?
He's not really my nephew, he's my wife's nephew.
I've never showed him any favouritism.
In fact, I hate him.
- But you love his ideas.
- No.
When he told me the idea,
I thought it was lousy.
When Finch brought it to me,
I said it was lousy.
In fact, I told him it was a lousy idea.
- Why'd you buy it?
- It seemed like a good idea.
- Treasure hunt. Treasure girl.
- Finch dressed it all up.
He can't deny that the idea of the Treasure Girl was his.
Right, J.B.
- Wally, that was my idea.
- And not a bad one, Ponty.
But who the hell picked that bubble-headed tomato?
Don't get any wrong ideas,
Wally, she's a fine girl.
You should have a talk with her.
I intend to.
Well, I think I got the whole picture.
Now, the question is what to do and who to do it to.
Wally, before you make any hasty decisions...
...I'd like to say a few words.
- About what?
About... Well, about humanity.
No, look, even though we're all part of the cold corporate setup...
...deep down under our skins there's flesh and blood. We're all brothers.
But some of us are uncles.
Now you may join the Elks, my friend
And I may join the Shriners
And other men may carry cards
As members of the diners
Still others wear a golden key
Or small Greek-letter pin
But I have learned
There's one great club
That all of us are in
There is a brotherhood of man
A benevolent brotherhood of man
A noble tie that binds
All human hearts and minds
Into one brotherhood of man
Your lifelong membership
Is free
Keep a-giving each brother
All you can
Oh, aren't you proud to be
In that fraternity?
The great big brotherhood of man
Wally, I want you to remember that before you consider firing Mr. Biggley.
Who's considering that?
Get him out of here!
I know what's on your mind.
You'd like to clear out the place.
I mean, from top to bottom.
It's the obvious move, but stop and think.
One man may seem incompetent
Another not make sense
While others look like quite a waste
Of company expense
They need a brother's leadership
So please don't do them in
Remember mediocrity
Is not a mortal sin
- They're
- We're
- In the
- In the
Brotherhood of man
Dedicated to giving all
We can
Oh, aren't you proud to be
In that fraternity?
The great big brotherhood of man
- What'd I do?
- No kidding?
- Is there really a brotherhood?
- Yes, you're a brother
Of man
- You are a brother
- On the level, a brotherhood of man
Oh, yes, oh, yes.
A noble tie that binds
All human hearts and minds
Into one brotherhood of man
Oh, yes, your lifelong membership
Is free
Keep a-giving each brother
All you can
- Oh, aren't you proud to be
- You got me
- In that fraternity?
- I got you
That great big brotherhood of man
Oh, that noble feeling
Feels like bells are pealing
Down with double-dealing
Oh, brother
You, you got me
Me, I got you
You
Oh, that noble feeling
Feels like bells are pealing
Down with double-dealing
Oh, brother
You, you got me
Me, I got you
You
Oh, that noble feeling
Feels like bells are pealing
Down with double-dealing
Oh, brother
You, you got me
Me, I got you
You
Your lifelong membership is free
Keep a-giving each brother
All you can
Oh, aren't you proud to be
In that fraternity?
The great big brotherhood of man
- Oh, Matt.
- Matt, any word?
Something big is brewing.
Oh, Miss Jones, what's up?
- There are gonna be some changes.
- You hear that? Changes.
Boys and girls, boys and girls.
May I have your attention, please?
Gather around, gather around.
I have an announcement to make.
As you know, there have been a few changes made at World Wide Wicket.
I'm speaking to you now in my new capacity as vice president...
...in charge of employee morale and psychological adjustment.
Mr. Tackaberry here is now in charge of personnel.
And now, I'd like to have you hear a few words...
...from our hard-driving, hard-working president.
Thank you. Boys and girls,
I have very good news for you.
I can truthfully state...
...that World Wide Wickets is now stronger than ever.
Much of the credit for this should go to a loyal and able young man.
Come here, Finch.
You're aware this youngster's rise has been spectacularly rapid.
As a matter of fact, for a while,
I thought he was after my job.
Luckily for me, he didn't want it.
No, no, J.B., your job...
Much too tough for me.
But if any credit is due, it goes to a great man...
...and a great humanitarian.
I mean the chairman of the board,
Mr. Wally Womper.
- Hear, hear.
- Incidentally...
...Mr. Womper has his charming new wife with him here today.
And let's get them both out here,
Mr. And Mrs. Womper.
Thank you. Thank you, boys and girls. Thank you.
And now, I have an announcement to make.
After 30 long years of service...
After 30 long years of service to this company...
...as chairman of the board,
I've decided to retire.
And my wife and I are taking a long honeymoon trip around the world.
Sweetie, what a surprise.
You didn't tell me.
I didn't know myself until Finch handed me the tickets.
Well, what the hell.
It's not a bad idea.
With that I'll concentrate on you.
Who's gonna be the new chairman of the board, as if I didn't know?
- I'll kill myself.
- Ponty, it's your baby now.
- Take good care of it.
- I don't know if...
- Congratulations.
- I'll accept.
- Take Mr. Finch to his new office.
- Right this way, Ponty.
Have any of you girls heard from Rosemary?
She packed up her things at the apartment.
- She left without a word.
- We thought you'd heard.
Right through here, Ponty.
- Well, Ponty, what do you think?
- Large.
Smitty, you don't think that
Rosemary went home to her mother.
I mean, she just has to be here.
I mean, it's just no good without her.
I'll call her family's place.
Maybe they've heard from her.
And let me know, you know, if you hear.
Twenty.
Twenty, Rosemary.
Rosemary, make up your mind, in or out.
I have other clients, you know.
I just couldn't leave you.
I'm stuck with you, I guess.
I adore you.
That reminds me...
...they wanna make me chairman of the board.
Look, is it all right with you?
Darling, I don't care if you work in the mailroom...
...or you're chairman of the board...
...or you're the president of the United States.
I love you.
- Say that again.
- I love you.
No, before that. About...
Good morning, Mr. President.
We'll play it the company way
Executive policy is by us okay
We'll never be president
But there's one thing clear
Whoever the company fires
We will still be here
Speech! Speech!
No, no. I ain't gonna make no speech.
I want to thank you bums for this wonderful birthday.
One thing I learned when I first started out...
...a man who ain't got friends stays poor...
...until he goes out and buys good ones.
Me, I got the best.
Sheriff Glick! Stand up.
Deputy Sheriff Potts!
Guy Gisborne!
All the rest of you mugs!
Wonderful pals!
Friends who would go out and cut a right arm off for me.
All I gotta tell them, who.
The reason I got such loyal friends is because I'm thoughtful.
I never asked nobody to work on a holiday.
Thanksgiving, New Y ear's,
Christmas, Fourth of July.
Only one time I asked, one Saint Valentine's Day...
...a little cleanup job.
I just want to thank all you mugs again.
Only thing I'm sorry is that my good pal Robbo ain't here...
...from New Orleans where he's taking in the races.
Well, that's all I've got to say for now.
Now everybody get drunk.
Wait a minute!
Before you all get drunk.
A toast to Big Jim.
Come on, let's hear it.
- To Big Jim!
- Happy Birthday, Big Jim!
Big Jim was a shmendrik.
He was no good.
The man was tight, he don't part with a dime.
And besides, he was a slob.
And on top of everything else, he wasn't an American citizen.
Things are different from here on in in Chicago now.
Let me give you the benefit of my thinking.
No more independent operations.
Forget them.
We're putting them together.
We're gonna merge them up into one organization.
There's gonna be just one big leader.
Is there anybody here that got any ideas...
...who's gonna be the new leader?
Tomatoes.
How about picking names out of a hat?
We're gonna use your hat.
Soon you're gonna have nothing to wear it on.
- May I make a suggestion?
- It's a democratic meeting. Yes.
Thank you. Gentlemen...
...as sheriff, I have to keep law and order here.
Now under Big Jim, it was hard with everyone fighting.
We don't want another mess like Big Jim here.
The crime commission's stronger.
People are fed up.
We need a leader with courage, strength, integrity.
There's only one man who fills that description: Guy Gisborne.
I accept the nomination.
Is there any objections before the nominations is closed?
You got something to say?
I motion somebody open a window.
Somebody open a window.
That's the stockyard side.
Being a democratic meeting...
...I motion that the nominations is closed.
I'm the only candidate, so I'm the new leader.
So I'm gonna thank you for the whole thing. Next business.
- What about Robbo?
- He joins like everyone else.
He ain't gonna like it somebody killed his pal.
Robbo is in or he's under.
You guys are gonna run things just like always.
Except now you're getting protection.
You're gonna get
City Hall protection.
That's beautiful.
Of course, you have to pay a small...
...service charge that's based on a percentage of your take.
- Soupmeat?
- How much service charge, boss?
- I'm making it 50%.
- Fifty percent!
Hatrack, what do you got?
Couldn't we get less service?
You can get less service.
But you're still paying 50%.
If anyone has a problem,
I got a special complaint box.
I can put your whole body in there.
I still say-
Forget Robbo!
Don't tell me about Robbo!
What's the matter?
You think you get protection for free? That's not a gift.
What do you think it costs?
Tell him.
I'd rather not be involved.
He don't want to be involved.
You're in for 25%.
You're involved pretty good.
Sure, 50% is high.
But he's grabbing 25.
I don't like it either.
I can't do it for less.
Well, scratch a few cousins.
I'm scratching nothing.
My hands is tied.
I'm locked in.
So, gentlemen, let me say this.
Let me nominate the 50% service charge as official.
Is there any objections?
All right. Now, listen to me.
This is the best thing for us.
Now we're all together, we're organized.
We're...
If I could find the word...
We're all for one.
Pals!
One thing, boss.
Exactly what are we gonna get?
Nothing.
Easy. Now just take it easy.
How are you, Robbo?
What are you doing here?
I thought you were down in New Orleans doing well.
- Who hit Big Jim?
- Hit who?
- Him.
- You're looking good.
Give the man a seat, get up!
All right, who hit him?
What's the difference?
Forget about it.
Who was the brain?
There were 34 killings in the last two months.
This town has had it.
You answered my question.
He had to go for the good of us all.
You take that badge off, you won't live to put it back.
We've got a new setup.
There's no more independence.
We merged into one organization.
The boys made me their new leader.
Looks like the day they fixed the power in the death house.
We're still gonna hustle...
...now we're protected from the top.
Fifty percent of the take.
What it is-
When they started the United States...
...they put the states in one union.
And I'm like the first president.
Give my regards to Martha.
Robbo, you better think it over.
I'll give it to you straight, Mr. President.
You stay out of the north side.
You come like George Washington,
I'll send you back like Lincoln.
Like Lincoln.
Excuse me.
I want to throw in a few words...
...about our friend that departed so suddenly.
Now, I know Big Jim a long time, and I want to say this.
He did not have enemies.
He had a lot of friends that didn't like him but you can't please everybody.
There was people calling him...
...a fink, a chiseler, a crooked hood.
There was people that didn't have nothing good to say.
But I can tell you this.
Big Jim had a- He was...
...a very good dresser.
I mean he looked mean on the outside, but inside...
Well, inside his closet he had 280 suits.
Now I want to introduce Robbo.
Here's a man that...
...was very close to
Big Jim in the past...
...and he might even be closer to him in the future.
Well, all I want to say is Big Jim has gone to meet the big G.
Big Jim was an inspiration to me.
When I was a kid, he caught me stealing hubcaps off his car.
He said, "Don't steal the hubcaps. Steal the whole car. "
Well, we're gonna miss you, Big Jim.
There won't be a guy like you around for a long time.
I think she come to the wrong stash.
- We should say something.
- It ain't none of our business.
I think it was disrespectful.
What do you think, boss?
- She's a good-looking dame.
- A relative?
Big Jim never had no relatives, only a brother.
That dame ain't nobody's brother. Come on.
Relax with the horn.
Park it and wait.
There's people trying to sleep. Let's go.
- Have a good time?
- Yes.
I'm surprised.
They water the liquor here.
- I want to see Robbo.
- Ain't in yet.
Open up. I'll wait for him.
- What'll you have?
- Nothing.
That guy shooting pool is waiting too.
- Who is he?
- I'm not sure.
He's not a threat with the cue stick.
You play with the other end.
I thought I recognized a friend.
I just blew in from Indiana.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't stop for a drink.
The bartender's my boyfriend.
All I had in mind was a game of pool.
How come you're chalking your finger?
For short shots.
By the way, where's the boss-man tonight?
I don't know who you're talking about.
I told you to stay out of the north side.
I'm trying to get the record straight.
You're right about the sheriff.
He was behind it.
I was thinking...
...we could make an arrangement for you to join.
- We do our own laundry.
- If there's an extra bundle...
- Anything else?
- No, that's it.
Give him a drink and get out of here.
Look at the way he's treating me.
We ain't in-betweeners.
We're either best friends or enemies.
- Why don't we be best friends?
- Your drink's waiting.
It's too bad.
He has so much to live for.
- You're blocking my way.
- Take a detour.
I don't take detours.
A little respect, or your friends will carry you in a box.
- Let me hit him, Robbo.
- Robbo?
If you shot pool with your tongue, you'd be good.
I can't stand the taste of chalk.
- Who are you?
- A bird lover who studies pigeons.
You don't mean real pigeons.
- No.
- Name your game.
- It's your table.
- How about a hundred a ball?
A hundred a ball?
I don't carry hundreds.
How about a thousand?
Knock off the lights, Will.
Rack them up.
Give me a stick.
Seven ways a game at a thousand a way, 7000.
How about goosing up the action a little? A little side bet?
- What kind?
- Oh, about 25 grand.
All right. That's 32.
You're a stranger.
You pick the stake holder.
I noticed you've got an honest face, baby.
Let's see how good you can lag that.
Pretty good. It's your break.
Nothing.
Excuse me.
I bow to a mechanic.
Your cushions are tired, threw me off my game.
Too bad. Pay him.
I like a bank with strong assets, baby.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
- What's your racket?
- I'm a brain surgeon.
Follow me.
- Your knitting.
- Oh, sorry.
Lock it up.
You a drinking man?
Anytime.
Help yourself.
What's your name?
Little John.
- You know him?
- Used to work in Indiana?
- Yeah.
- Like what?
Beer, alky, dice. Nothing big.
Why you in Chicago?
Looking for new connections.
- Try Gisborne?
- Nope.
Why not?
Crooked hood.
This town is down to two slices: him and me.
I know all about it.
He's organized. He's got 85 guns, plus the sheriff.
We're an even dozen...
...if you include a hooker who used to throw knives.
You like the long shots.
Want to jump in?
I'm in.
Let me give you the bad news first.
Gisborne's gonna hit, and he's gonna hit fast.
I don't know where. I have no idea.
He can knock over everything at once.
You ever think of knocking first?
This guy don't hear so good.
Eighty-five guns, he can knock seven times harder than we can.
- What's his pride and joy?
- A gambling joint.
Last thing Gisborne expects is a visit.
That's a good reason for paying a visit.
That's not a bad idea.
We're gonna get it anyway.
I was hoping we'd have help.
You could also lose a few more guns.
When your opponent's got all the aces...
...there's only one thing to do: kick over the table.
- What would you like?
- Nothing.
Well, in my opinion-
Drink your cocoa. There's only one way to handle this thing.
We pick 10 of the best soldiers to kill Robbo.
If they miss, we'll have a war.
This city won't go for it.
How do we get rid of them?
Give them the flu?
- Break them.
- I will.
Knock over his club.
- He builds another.
- Knock it over.
He'll be dry soon.
Listen to this.
Suppose he pays me a visit over here.
I got a quarter million dollars tied up here.
He'd have to be out of his skull.
You better be right.
I know I'm right.
I'd bet my life on it.
You got a bet.
All right, let's go.
Load up. Load up.
All right, load up.
Come on, move.
Get your morning paper!
Get your morning paper!
Hey, that Gisborne over there?
Yeah, it sure is.
Ain't that Robbo over there?
- It sure is.
- Where's he headed?
Wherever it is, he's in for a surprise when he returns.
Where's he headed?
Wherever it is, he's in for a surprise when he returns.
- Blue Jaw.
- Yeah, boss?
- Itsy-bitsy pieces.
- Gotcha, boss.
Out of the way, will ya?
Oh, that's music. That's beautiful.
That's my favorite tune, eh.
Oh, that's gorgeous.
Play that thing there, eh.
Congratulations, you did good.
Folks, this joint is now closed for new alterations.
Leave quietly and no one gets hurt.
Guys, have a good time.
Hey, Will, I thought we was friends.
We are. What are you worried about?
I never miss anything I aim at.
You came awful close.
You made me nervous.
I didn't mean to make you nervous.
Take a rest so you won't be nervous.
I'll take over.
I appreciate that, thanks very much.
I don't feel good, my health...
Hundred thousand hangovers down the drain.
I had the same thought exactly.
Seventy-five feet by 82 feet.
Let's see. That's not important.
I have been a builder for 38 years, but this is a new one on me.
All we want is a club that's 100% knock-proof.
This is it.
If anyone can ever build it.
You're the guy who'll do it.
I better give you an idea of what this will cost:
- Close to 400,000.
- All right, start working.
- Don't you want a competitive bid?
- You don't get the idea.
It's secret.
We're talking to one builder.
That builder ain't talking to nobody, not even his crew.
- They must look at blueprints.
- They look at nothing!
Break it up so one guy don't know what the other guy is doing.
- Yes, sir.
- How long will it take?
- Maybe six, seven months?
- Three.
- But that's impossible-
- Three.
- It's possible.
- Possible.
- Hey, boss. Phone's ringing.
- Well, answer it.
Why do they always ask me to answer the phone?
Everything all broken up here anyway.
I don't even know where it is.
How can I answer the phone?
If there's no phone, I'm leaving.
There's ringing, must be a phone.
You keep ringing, baby.
I'm gonna find you.
Where there's a wire, there's gotta be a phone.
Just get out.
I done found it, boss.
Hello?
Guess who? It's Gisborne.
- Three months.
- Three months is hardly time.
I'm not a magician.
This is a big job-
We'll split the difference.
Two months!
Two?
- Why do you want to argue?
- Me, argue? That's ridiculous.
- Hello?
- What do you say, Robbo?
- What's new, kid?
- Nothing much. What's new with you?
Nothing much. I'm sorry
I wasn't here when you called.
That's okay.
As long as you got my message.
I got the message, believe me.
I got it pretty good.
What are you going to do now?
- You gonna build a new joint?
- Starting tomorrow.
Don't use so many nails.
It's hard to take apart.
- All right, pal, what's on your mind?
- I'll tell you.
I've been thinking.
Why are we killing one another for?
We're both starting from scratch.
Why don't we build a joint together?
Be partners.
I'd rather keep you as an enemy.
As long as I hate you, I've got taste.
This guy's a funny bum, this guy.
Why you being stupid?
I got you seven to one, not even horse-betting odds.
I'll improve the odds.
Maybe you won't live that long.
That's a promise.
You never kept a promise in your life, you bum.
- What's he pushing?
- He wants to be partners.
How come he's so friendly?
There's been a lot of heat since they hit Big Jim.
He figures he'll see action here, so he's being chummy.
That's nice. I'm going to put out a good deal of money on this...
...and you have certain occupational hazards...
Give him 50 G as a deposit.
Tell the help they're on salary and we'll open soon.
- Get cleaned up, you look like a bum.
- Sorry.
Hey, architect, you got two months.
You begin tomorrow.
Look at that candy store.
Ricks, you count to 50.
- How do you do, miss?
- How do you do, Robbo?
- You know my name?
- Quite well.
I'm Little John.
Didn't we meet at the polo matches?
- Do you have a place we can be alone?
- Do I have a place-?
- Down, boy.
- But-
Handle your financial transaction.
I have a place we can be alone, Miss-
- Please, call me Marian.
- Marian. Fine.
Excuse us. We had some untidy callers last night.
- Where'd he dig that up?
- At the cemetery.
The upstairs maid couldn't get to this one either.
- So I see.
- How about a chair?
Thank you.
- I shouldn't keep you in suspense.
- It's all right.
I'm enjoying the view.
My name is Marian Stevens.
- Don't ring no bell with me.
- It will.
- What were you doing at the funeral?
- Same as you.
- But I was saying goodbye to Big Jim.
- So was I.
- You mean, you knew him?
- Big Jim was my father.
I was like a son to him.
He said nothing about a daughter.
Then you weren't quite like a son.
- Where you been all these years?
- Foxcroft, Vassar, the Sorbonne.
Private schools.
I don't recognize them unless they got a PS in front of them.
- You want a little drink?
- No, thank you.
Mother died when I was born.
For obvious reasons...
...Father kept me out of his world.
Stevens was my mother's maiden name.
- Sure you don't want a drink?
- No, thank you.
- I liked Big Jim. He was some guy.
- He was very fond of you.
What can I do for you?
Money? Contacts?
There is something.
Let's go to Blackstone.
We'll eat, we'll talk.
No, I want to discuss it here, now.
- Well, what's on your mind?
- I want my father's death avenged.
You mean, you want me to sue somebody?
I want you to get the man who killed my father.
Classy-looking dame like you shouldn't be making statements like that.
- I'll pay you 25,000.
- Hold it. Wait a minute. Whoa.
I run a gambling joint.
I hustle beer.
I make people happy, not croak them.
Thirty-five thousand.
How about a little drink?
You're upset about your old man.
I respect you for it.
But shop for a killer?
It's walking in the jungle.
- You'll get hurt.
- Do you know who did it?
The sheriff!
Fifty thousand.
Don't be crazy.
Go back to your fox hunt.
- You said you liked my father.
- I liked him!
The cemetery's full of guys I liked!
I ain't ready to join that club!
Wait a minute.
I didn't mean to holler on you.
I'm just worried. I don't want to see your pretty face pushed in.
- How about we have dinner?
- I want the sheriff settled first.
We can discuss social activities afterward.
You ain't dead, pal.
You just put on high heels and a skirt.
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- You have more to be sorry for.
Sit next to your cousin there.
Look how lonesome he looks by himself.
Is there an ashtray?
He's worried about dirtying the floor?
Before I call the meeting to order...
...I want to apologize for our surroundings.
But there's nothing to worry about.
What you see here is part of the sheriff's plan...
- ... how we're gonna break Robbo.
- Don't blame me for this.
You're a big thinker.
Anybody can make a mistake.
I called this meeting because I thought you got a new plan.
Like where will I get the 250,000 to fix this joint?
- I haven't got that kind of money.
- You ain't got it on your person.
But you're getting 25% of the juice, that's steep.
I thought in view of the emergency, you'd cut it down to 10%.
Did that ever occur to you?
- My people won't stand for it.
- Well, I was just asking.
- I resent you putting the blame on me.
- Don't be resentful.
I'd never hurt your feelings.
You're a marvelous human being.
- Is the meeting done?
- That's all.
I gotta go to City Hall.
Coming, Potts?
Didn't you want to wait here?
You were gonna see the new insurance man?
- Guy's agent's got a new life policy.
- Short-term.
There's a man turned out to be a big disappointment.
Deputy? How would you describe the word "insurance"?
It's anticipating a catastrophe and being prepared.
Speaking about catastrophes, suppose your boss...
...caught a virus and there was no more partnership.
- What would the new sheriff charge?
- Ten percent.
Call to order.
Ways to dissolve partnership with the old sheriff. T omatoes.
- Let's pack him in limes.
- That's too dangerous.
We can't take no chances they'll find any evidence.
How about making a deposit in Lake Michigan?
No good. They tried that last year with Julius.
Two days later, he's cruising into port like a leviathan.
Vermin, you got the floor.
I make a motion somebody open a window.
Somebody open a window.
Fellas, let's go!
You're not on a lunch break.
Think! Charlie Bananas.
My uncle's a guard at a steel mill in Gary, Indiana.
How about we put him in the boiler...
...throw him in with scrap, he melts in the furnace...
...next thing he's a chassis for a Buick?!
How do we get him to Indiana?
I got it! Parcel post.
If we don't insure, it's very cheap.
We gotta stay closer to town.
Now, forget about Indiana and the parcel post!
What, Twitch?
You gonna sneeze or say something?
I got a stonemason friend.
He's building some cornerstones...
...for the new Knights of Pythias building, a new bridge...
- ... and the new police station.
- Go on.
If someone wants to stash something, not to be found for over 100 years...
The sheriff in the police station?
Will you let the man continue?
The sheriff is over six feet, the cornerstones is only three feet.
- How about we fold him once?
- That'll work. Yeah, that'll work.
In the police station.
I think that's very sentimental.
That's like burying a garbage man in the dump.
- The sheriff will be real happy here.
- He wasn't goofing on the job.
He was the first in, and he'll be the last out.
- Tell them them seats is taken.
- Them seats are taken.
- Taken?
- In the back, you'll get nice seats.
- Who else is coming?
- Robbo's coming.
- You're kidding.
- I told him what we did.
- He said he wouldn't miss it.
- I hate to disagree with you, but-
Here he comes.
Glad you could make it.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the honorable chief of police...
...of our great and wonderful city:
Chief Oscar C. Brockton.
Thank you.
Friends, it is a great privilege and a distinct honor for me...
...to dedicate this structure today.
It's more than a structure.
It's a symbol of justice and order.
Couldn't find a bigger room?
The Knights of Pythias, but he wasn't a member.
I must inject one sad note into these proceedings.
The sudden and strange disappearance of a man, a coworker...
...who truly could be called a cornerstone of this building:
Sheriff Octavius Glick.
How I wish he were present today.
Present? He's leaning on him.
I trust he's out of town on business and isn't the victim of foul play.
That was no foul.
That was a solid hit.
I know you will join me in dedicating this great new building...
...to Sheriff Glick, a man of principle...
...a man of determination, a man who would not bend.
- We had no trouble.
- Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Robbo. Listen, come here.
I squared the books on Big Jim, but I don't hear thanks.
- Thanks.
- That's all you got to say?
I'll give it to you straight.
Listen to me.
You're out of line.
Get back in line.
- Otherwise, I'm gonna have you hit.
- You do what you have to do.
If that's the way you want it.
It's not for myself. I like you.
But they're paying protection, you ain't paying.
- I understand.
- Then there's no hard feelings?
No hard feelings. Forget it.
- Liqueur in the drawing room, madame.
- Thank you.
You're staring again, Robbo.
I can't figure you and Big Jim out of the same stable.
If I'm not his daughter, who am I?
A society dame with the hots for tough guys.
- You like society dames?
- Not especially.
Then why did you accept my invitation for dinner tonight?
That's what my boys want to know.
- They're worried you might be a decoy.
- Care to frisk me?
I just did.
Cointreau, brandy, help yourself.
- What color you want?
- Cointreau, please.
If I'm not Big Jim's daughter, why did I ask you to do in his killer?
For which, by the way, I thank you.
I told you once, that's not my racket.
I had nothing to do with it.
With Big Jim gone, it leaves this town up for grabs.
I don't know. There's still Gisborne.
Father often spoke of retiring...
...and the man he said he wanted to follow him was you.
Is that so?
Considering where he finally went, it's discouraging.
You wouldn't be careless as to let anyone throw you a birthday party.
Only if I had a guncheck concession.
It's time for the big move.
Make it and it's all the way.
- I get the feeling I'm being had.
- Had?
Nudged.
- Nudged?
- It's Italian. I'll tell you later.
You misunderstand. You can take over this town. I just want to help.
When I want your help,
I'll ask for it.
You want to be a two-bit thief forever?
Big Jim's daughter, sure.
I bet you never had a doll...
...just a rattle on your tail.
You like it dark?
Some big guy comes in...
...and gives me this box from Miss Stevens.
- It wasn't ticking, so I took it.
- It wasn't ticking, so you took it.
There's a card too. "Thanks for taking care of things. Marian. "
I think Robbo's an old-time mechanic.
Spends an evening with a doll and she sends $50,000.
- Some girls is grateful.
- True, true.
I had one like that.
She was a health nut.
Whenever we went out, she'd send me a bucket of yogurt.
I think I got some stashed away.
Maybe she wants some of the action?
Robbo don't need no partners.
- This here is yogurt.
- This is yogurt.
What's this?
It's from Miss Stevens.
Fifty grand. America needs you for the Olympics.
She thinks I hit the sheriff.
Let her be as stubborn as she wants.
- Take it back.
- Take it back?
- Back.
- Back.
It smells good.
Wait. Can't we talk this over, boss?
You'll hurt her feelings.
If she's stubborn, you'll have it back tomorrow.
Dump it.
You mean spread it-
I don't mean that.
I mean, find anything, but get rid of it.
- Okay.
- Hold it.
Sorry.
Back.
This used to belong to Big Jim.
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!
Robin Hood sure is a nice guy.
You want a pipe and slippers?
You paper moocher, you!
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!
Robin Hood in Chicago!
Steals from the rich and gives to the poor!
Thank you!
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!
Robin Hood in Chicago!
This Robin Hood's methods differ from his predecessor.
He uses gambling and bootlegged beer...
...to help orphans.
All the world loves a scoundrel, it seems...
...and its newest hero is Robbo.
Hold it, Robbo.
Did you think this would happen?
Wave your hat, Robbo.
- What's the next charity?
- Which?
I'll answer all your-
- How far-?
- Did you hear him?
Don't get smart.
- What's that?
- I saw it in a movie.
- Shut up.
- How far do you-?
I may not like the climate on page one.
- What'd you have in mind?
- You can't print it.
- This is the last?
- I'm Robbo, not Rockefeller.
No more 50 grand from me.
I gotta go to work.
All right, press, let's go.
Who's Robin Hood?
Must be some hood that steals birds.
Who'd want a hot canary?
- John, you know him?
- Who?
This Robin Hood.
He's an Englishman.
He had an operation going for him in the forest.
Snatching birds, like I told ya.
He had a raccoon hat.
Sir Walter Raleigh had a raccoon hat.
What was his angle?
He put his coat over a mud puddle...
...so this naked blond could cross the street.
I thought that was Daniel Boone.
When you read, you larn. Learn.
- Hi, boys.
- Hi.
- Go see what's outside.
- What's going on?
News reels and photographers.
Like the boss beating a federal rap.
Hey, boss, how about a shave?
- No.
- How about a manicure?
- I don't need one.
- Anything?
- Surprise me.
- Okay.
Look at these letters.
"Home for the Aged," they want 10 Gs.
"Home for Wayward Girls"-
I'll send something.
This lady has 14 kids, gonna be evicted.
This guy who knew your dad.
He wants to go to
Florida for his asthma.
- Nice place for asthma.
- Send a few hundred.
- They might be liars.
- Or not.
You can't send everybody money.
- They'll break you.
- Hey, boss.
- There's a visitor.
- Who?
Allen A. Dale.
Send him in.
He's got the whole town outside.
- Is he in?
- It's in.
Give him $300. He's got problems.
No, perish the thought at its inception, kind sir.
This unheralded intrusion into your presence...
...is not with the purpose of soliciting pecuniary offerings.
I ask of you, do not misconstrue.
He has a problem with his throat.
So you know, I am the amanuensis...
...the secretary at the institution...
...which has benefitted from your gift.
I was so overcome that
I couldn't resist...
...the urge to bring happy tidings...
...to communications mediums.
This act, sir, this act of serendipity will be returned.
He does have a problem with his throat.
- You talk English?
- Yes.
- What do you want?
- Well...
...I'm from the Orphan Home.
I told the newspaper about you.
And I made the Robin Hood comparison.
I didn't think it'd take off like this.
So you started this?
I hope you're not disgruntled by my impertinence.
No, sit down, sit down.
Thank you, sir.
Here you are, pops.
Ain't I seen you somewhere before?
I've been trailing you all day.
You're popular, Mr. Robbo.
A real Robin Hood.
You like this character?
He was the most beloved rogue in literature.
Brave, handsome, compassionate.
He's the only hood who really made it.
- I'm like him?
- Even your looks.
- Give this kid a drink.
- No, it's forbidden, you see.
I've been warned since I was brought in.
Brought in? You an orphan?
No, no, not an orphan.
I was left with bread and a blanket.
The old story.
- How old were you?
- Fourteen.
Why didn't you speak up?
I liked the arrangement.
My folks were deadbeats.
We moved every other week.
I learned to skip before I could walk.
I was up for adoption for 26 straight years.
Terribly discouraging.
Who wants a kid that's older than his father?
To fill in the time, I started doing secretarial work at the home.
- How about you move in with us?
- You mean you want to adopt me, sir?
Tears your heart out, don't it?
No, I didn't mean that.
Maybe you could help with the mail.
Separate sinceres from crocodiles.
Send a couple dollars apiece.
We got no time. We're rebuilding a knocked-over joint.
I'd be of inestimable service.
I could write speeches.
Give items to the newspapers, take care of your charities.
I'd make you a legend in your own time.
- Start him off with a C-note a week.
- Thank you, sir, and bless you.
Oh, gee, I'm a hood.
I'm a hood! Ho!
That's a hood?
That's right, right on in.
Take your place in line.
There you go. Right back here, there's plenty for everyone.
Right on in.
You get right in here, sir.
There you are, Mark.
Here's one for you.
- You new?
- Yes, sir.
There you are.
Here's your Robin Hood hat.
- The feather goes in the hat.
- In your hat!
I don't appreciate your attitude.
Mr. Robbo was considerate enough to give us this.
Accept it graciously and be a merry man.
That cockamamie outfit? You're nuts.
- I got enough trouble being an orphan.
- Yeah. He gots trouble.
I'm attempting to bring some cohesiveness into this motley group.
If you're going into a snippy snit, remaining aloof...
...I'll report you to the deportment department with 12 demerits.
I think something's wrong with his throat.
That could mean automatic expulsion from the brass band.
What's the rap for shooting an orphan with an arrow?
I don't know.
Hear ye, hear ye, merry men of Robin Hood!
I gaze upon you with pride and admiration, 25, 24, brave, fearless...
...courageous warriors dedicated to the cause of right and truth.
All hail Robin Hood!
All hail Robin Hood!
- Hip-hip-hooray!
- Hip-hip-hooray!
- Hip-hip-hooray!
- Hip-hip-hooray!
You may turn in your tuba.
- How do you like the sign, Robbo?
- That ain't bad.
- Why not try it there?
- You got it.
That ain't from the five-and-dime.
- The costumes come yet?
- I ain't seen them.
Maybe you better check.
- More flowers. Lovely, ain't they?
- Yeah, they're lovely, yeah.
- Got everything you need?
- Enough to float a battleship.
- How are you doing?
- What do I do with these?
They usually belong on gambling tables.
- Yeah.
- And count them.
- Me count?
- How about raising the chandeliers?
- Ridiculous.
- What did you say?
- We're gonna raise them.
How do I know where your knitting is?
What, are you tired, pal?
I've been interviewing cigarette girls all day.
Good thing we only need two.
Come on.
Do you think three dozen cans will be adequate?
That's all we ordered.
I'll give the young ladies a promotional talk.
We'll open the joint in two hours, so go home and get dressed.
- Dressed, sir?
- This ain't a Halloween party.
This is a classy opening.
You need decent clothes.
- I don't understand.
- Look at how you look.
- Better you don't look.
- Yeah, maybe not.
Am I correct in my assumption...
...you find my habiliments reprehensible?
- Something's wrong with his throat.
- I said that six weeks ago.
I hate to belabor the obvious, but in the interest of semantics...
...I'm impelled to observe you indulged in a mixed metaphor.
- It's his throat.
- His throat.
You look like something of a disaster area.
You think I'm too bizarre?
I think you're too carnival.
Get out of here.
Do you mind?
Well!
- Hooray!
- Hooray!
Sweetheart, buy the boys a drink, will you?
-14, red.
- Oh, dear, I lost again.
She lost again, listen to this.
- May I have $1 worth of 10-cent chips?
- Another dollar in 10-cent chips.
How do you figure it?
What's to figure?
They're all over at Robbo's place.
All of a sudden the bum's a celebrity.
They made him into a Jean Harlow, a Mickey Mouse.
He gave $3 to a couple orphans and they put his picture in the papers.
People want to look at him.
He's a celebrity.
In the meantime, I'm dying here.
Look at this joint.
But I've got nothing to worry about.
Because I'm paying you protection.
Just temporary, the novelty will soon wear off, and you'll get the business.
Somebody else will get the business before then.
What do you expect me to do?
Cut down on your cocoa.
We'll start with that.
My mind's made up. I'll send 50 of my best boys there with cannons.
They'll wipe out the whole joint.
One of them will get Robbo.
Please! That would be a catastrophe.
He has lots of influential friends.
The whole town would be down on us.
What should I do with this joint?
Be patient, wait a few days.
I have a plan.
We don't have to use violence.
We lick Robbo by breaking him.
- What was that?
- We break him!
That's what your cousin, the other scientist I listened to-
Just let me finish.
We'll knock over the joint.
This time we'll make the raid official.
I'll use real cops. Keep the men here in case he should hit back.
- How many cops?
Thirty.
Thirty.
- We'll move next week.
- Tonight.
The place is full of big shots, judges-
Tonight.
To the ground.
Something for the cause, please?
Thank you, gentlemen.
Oh, you back so soon?
Honey, you do have the busiest can in the place.
Here you are.
Empty it. Empty it. Empty it.
Thank you.
- How do you like it?
- Good evening.
Congratulations.
A wonderful night for you.
- Congratulations to you, if it works.
- It will work, all right.
You got your chance. It better work.
Oh, it will work.
I hope.
All right, everybody knows what to do.
Now go to your stations.
- You too. Come on!
- Okay, yeah.
- I can't find my clothes.
- What do you mean-?
There they are. Will you come on?
Everybody set?
Ladies and gentlemen, a slight delay.
T ake your chips and go to the lounge, please.
No need for alarm.
Head for the lounge.
That's it.
Move right along there.
Peace be with you, brother.
Club is in violation of code 378.
Destroy it!
Peace be with you, brother.
Holy smokes.
I'd have sworn there was a joint here.
Friends, we are gathered here tonight to honor a good man, a righteous man.
- We got the wrong place.
- How could we?
I am proud to introduce to you...
...the Reverend Allen A. Dale.
We are gathered here this evening, brothers and sisters...
...to explore the devious paths of that demon: sin.
Sin can transport you to heights of fame and fortune...
...and plunge you to degradation, demoralization and depravation.
Sin promises many prizes, appears in many disguises...
...and fights like hell before it demises.
So we are met this evening in this hallowed hall...
...so you may recognize sin's henchmen when they call.
And our subject for tonight is the most evil of them all.
Who that? I mean, who's that?
Alcohol.
I'll testify. I want to testify.
Then cleanse yourself, my child.
I know this poor, unfortunate soul...
...and the fight she's waging against sin.
That devil hooch has turned her into an unsightly person.
- Give us your testimony, my child.
- Well, it all began with Daddy.
There's a gambling layout here and we'll find it.
Do you know how old he was when he died?
He was 25.
That's why I've got to come clean.
- Why?
- Because I'm already 17.
I want to testify!
You've got to let me testify.
Come forward, dear brother.
Come forward.
You see here a man who just last year...
...was the United States Olympic heavyweight wrestling champion.
A shadow of his former self, wasted in health, ravaged by sin.
Give us your testimony, brother.
I was cruel.
- I was mean.
- He was mean.
I was a...
...pickpocket.
Oh, no, not a pickpocket!
Then, sin got me in-
- Gin.
- A little bit of that too.
Sin and gin got me in its clutches.
That's why I need forgiving.
Now my hand shakes so much,
I can't even make a living.
How do you believe this?
I tell you, it walked away?
Knock down the walls-
- It's a revival meeting.
- It ain't a revival meeting.
Every crapshooter in town's here.
There's a joint here. We'll find it.
- I want to testify.
- You don't have to-
- I want to.
- You don't have to-
- Oh, let him testify.
- Very well.
Then let us lead you on the path of righteousness. Not long ago...
...he was the foremost brain surgeon in this grand and glorious country.
Success was smiling upon him.
Go ahead, tell us your story, oh, downtrodden one.
I used spirits for medicinal purposes only.
I manufactured it for medicinal purposes only.
Then I drank what I manufactured...
...and drank myself out of business for medicinal purposes only.
That's right!
- I give up. I'm pulling my men.
- You can't.
If I don't pull them,
I won't have any.
We're leaving.
Peace be with you, brother.
You, brother, you can drop dead.
Peace, all you fine gentlemen.
Now Robbo's a national personality.
People love him.
They spend money in his joint while we're dying.
My old man's getting free soup every day.
Not important. Forget about it.
I think he's a threat to the younger generation.
I caught a kid stealing my tires, he pulls a bow and arrow on me.
My old man gets free soup every day-
Forget about that soup already!
If you're so impressed, go join his merry men.
Stick a feather in your ear, walk around in green drag, you'll be happy.
What's the matter? You can't see what he's doing in your heads?
I gotta explain that to you.
This man's organizing himself the biggest bodyguard there ever was:
The people of Chicago.
He's in so thick with them, you can't touch him with a flagpole.
Now once and for all, this man's gotta go.
We can't have any violence,
I warn you.
Forget the warnings. Just sit down.
My friend is working on a cornerstone for a synagogue.
- No.
- Even if we get Robbo to convert?
Disappearing is the same as hitting.
- Open a window.
- I got an idea.
Somebody open a window anyway.
Before we offed the sheriff,
I took some things from him.
His badge, his gun, his wallet with his driver's license.
Keep talking, Vermin.
Maybe we could use the stuff.
We could put it in a certain place.
I like what you're saying.
Keep talking. Just keep talking.
I don't have experience in this area.
But I think I can handle it.
Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth.
- I do.
- Take the stand.
Mr. Gisborne, tell the court of a conversation...
...between you and the defendant after Big Jim's murder.
I'll tell you that story now.
I was in the hotel with some friends...
...we meet to play mahjong.
It's 12:30, Robbo comes in.
He don't knock, nothing.
He barges right in, and he declares himself.
He says this, I'll never forget it, now that Big Jim...
...has gone to meet his maker...
...he's decided- He means that the man was dead.
I want you to understand.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Now he says Big Jim is dead, he's the new boss...
...and everybody has to pay him a 50 percent service charge...
...that's for protection.
Tell me, Mr. Gisborne...
...what was your reaction?
Stunned. I was stunned.
In other words, I couldn't talk.
Finally, I regained my composure, and I said to him:
"Robbo. Why do we need a new boss for?
We've got an honest man,
Sheriff Glick. "
What did he say to that?
You want the exact words?
The exact words.
Here's what he said.
"Don't worry about Sheriff Glick...
...because I'm going to fix his wagon. "
Next thing I know, the wagon is fixed.
Did Robbo say how he planned to...
...fix the sheriff's wagon?
He did not.
But I'll tell you this.
When he fixes a wagon, it's an interesting ride.
I object. This comes from a witness...
...who is a convicted murderer and racketeer.
He is under oath...
...he knows the consequences for lying.
- Absolutely.
- Objection overruled.
Thank you. He's nice.
That will be all, Mr. Gisborne.
Sit down.
Deputy Potts...
...were there meetings between Robbo and the sheriff...
- ... prior to the murder.
- One, in particular.
Robbo said something would happen to Big Jim...
...and asked the sheriff if he wanted protection.
The sheriff threw him out.
I see. Did Robbo contact him after this?
He threatened him.
The sheriff was in fear of his life.
In other words, the sheriff could not be bribed.
A man of honesty and integrity.
- Y es.
- An upstanding public official.
A very solid citizen.
I've just returned from a visit with our leader.
What are we now?
The merry men of 574392?
I demand to see the warden.
I find your levity tasteless and macabre.
- How did he kill the sheriff?
- He didn't have anything to do...
...with that.
Don't you believe him?
Anybody want a hat?
There's a good lesson to learn from this.
Robbo made mistakes in the past...
...but they've come back to haunt him.
Boy can he dance.
I was framed!
- Liqueur in the drawing room.
- Thank you.
Tell me, why did you leave Indiana?
The boss, Grubby Mattson, had a girl named Bumblebee O'Neill...
...she was a dancer and he got worried that I was also with her.
He didn't like somebody else getting the honey, so I decided to buzz off.
You have two weaknesses: women and pool.
The day I find a gal that can handle a cue, I got it made.
Father taught me the game when I was 12.
- I still play once in a while.
- What kind do you like?
Rotation.
That figures.
Brandy, Cointreau, help yourself.
- And you?
- Brandy, please.
John?
- Where do go you from here?
- Robbo's store.
- May take 20 years.
- At 2000 a week, I'll eat.
- John.
- Yes?
Do you always want to be a storekeeper?
When you see something you want, you should take it.
I'm beginning to get the ringings.
I think we're on two different tracks.
Keep talking.
We'll come to a junction.
Just give me the right proposition.
You're on top of the rightest proposition you've had.
If you're talking about taking over, forget it. Robbo's my pal.
Who's talking about that?
I'm talking about using what you have to its fullest.
- Like what?
- Like the charities.
If I had my way, I'd dump it all.
It's the best horse in the race.
- You talk like you want to be a jockey.
- You look like a front-runner.
I think it's post time.
Let's make it a nice, long race.
How do they look?
Not good, Robbo. We'll appeal.
The prospects are bad, but-
- How bad?
- Twenty.
- Years?
- If you're lucky.
That's a lot of license plates.
Everybody rise.
Cook County, lllinois.
Judge Komp presiding.
Defendant is present.
Have you reached a verdict?
It's irregular, but I would like to make a statement.
Proceed.
For four weeks, this jury has listened to the testimony.
The defendant not only supposedly killed the sheriff...
...he started the Chicago Fire, and killed Cock Robin.
I've been a detective for 34 years...
...and I've seen good ringers.
I think the prosecution deserves congratulations for having...
...the best collection...
...of shifty-eyed, double-crossing two-faced liars.
This jury declares the defendant innocent.
Who mentioned Cock Robin?
Things like this happen.
Hey, boss, welcome home!
Hey, boss!
It's great to be back, everybody.
I want the biggest blowout ever seen tonight.
Balloons and streamers.
I'll get the dough for some shopping.
What's the matter?
It's been changed.
Who changed it?
- John, sir.
- Why?
He thought you'd be-
Change it back.
Where's John been?
He wasn't at the trial.
He's working on the charities.
- That's your job.
- There have been changes.
That so?
Let's take a look.
- Will he do anything rash?
- I hope he gets the same jury.
Hi, boys. Hello, men.
Everything seems okay.
Open it.
When did you get out?
Where's John?
Does anybody know where the chief is?
- The chief?
- Yeah, the chief.
He's with her royal majesty.
Yeah, that's where he is.
Reports from Atlanta are great.
They passed 50,000 in 48 hours.
Gus, New England is wide open.
Get a soup kitchen in Boston.
If they don't drink minestrone...
...toss in some clams and call it chowder.
Keep in touch.
You should get up to see if your legs still work.
With something like you, who needs legs?
- I don't think-
- That's a good idea.
Jail's out early today.
I'm disappointed. I'd respect you if you took over alone.
It's not a takeover.
We raised the action.
- It still has your name.
- Thanks.
Show him the report.
We got no rules for dames in our racket...
...but you pay if you make a mistake, so no more mistakes.
That, I take it, is a special reprieve for Big Jim's daughter.
You're charitable. I'll tell you how to be even more charitable.
The Robin Hood Foundation stays as is.
You will have an office, where you will be given a pen...
...and an allowance for your benefaction.
With only one slight modification:
I take, you give.
My gift to you.
You didn't do that right.
Don't tell him he's a stooge, he's got pride.
He's got nothing!
You should have tried for a partnership.
Robbo is no longer a consideration.
We've got his rep, tonight you get rid of him.
I like Robbo.
- I'm not hitting.
- You're scared.
Not of him, you. You move too fast.
I like things easy. I'm packing.
I take a candy store Romeo...
...stick half of Chicago in his pocket, and this is my payoff?
A guy shouldn't work for a boss with great legs.
Keeps his mind off business.
Robbo, he crosses his legs, nothing.
- Liqueur in the drawing room.
- Thanks.
So you're Big Jim's little girl.
You sure didn't inherit his build.
- That's charming.
- I know some jokes.
We must move quickly.
- Guy.
- What?
Call me Guy.
I want you to feel free with me.
By quickly, I mean tonight.
Tomorrow's better.
Tonight we get to know one another.
We'll break up the ice a little.
We move tonight or never.
Tonight? I'm not against that.
I'd like to move right now.
Is anyone using this room?
It's very rude to rise when I'm still seated.
- Stand up then.
- Charming.
I can be debonair.
Can I move this chair?
I'm too far from you.
You're beautiful.
- Mr. Gisborne.
- Guy. Call me Guy.
While Robbo was away,
I got the charities.
John was fronting for me.
So you were behind that?
I didn't think it was John, because what does he know?
I built it, and I have no intention of giving it up.
But I can't fight Robbo alone.
Take care of him and you and I can have a partnership.
I like the whole idea.
There's a few problems.
It's not easy. He could get you with both hands in his pockets.
He could shoot with his navel.
Second, he's got friends.
The people of Chicago have made him into a hero.
That Robin Hood's been dead
600 years don't matter.
Number three is his pal John.
They're close, like this here.
- You have to hit two, not one.
- Then hit two.
Hit two?
This operation clears 100,000 a week.
In three months we can double that.
In a year, the moon.
What'll we do with Deputy Potts?
Get rid of him too.
Him too. Who was your mother, Dutch Schulz?
I'll hit two, not the deputy.
He's protection.
- Very well, forget the sheriff.
- Oh, thank you.
That's two we're hitting.
- That's a double jackknife.
- A double jackknife?
That's a dry dive.
You have a phone?
- Proceed.
- Thank you.
Garfield 5525.
Twitchy? Gisborne.
Listen, regarding the stonemason.
I want a double accommodation for Robbo and his pal John.
Not singles. You got a family-size?
What do you got?
No. Wait, what was that last one?
I like it. Oh, I like it.
Prepare. Prepare.
Everything will be all right.
I'm curious, Mr. Gisborne.
- Always Guy.
- You must give me the details.
Can we find a more comfortable place where we could talk? A couch?
How will you kill them?
That is a professional secret.
You can understand that.
You can tell me. We are going into business together.
So we'll find a soft location and have a conference.
Would you prefer, Cointreau or brandy?
Anything is fine.
But first, you must tell me all about it.
Guysie.
Guysie? Guysie?
I'll tell you everything.
Hey, you got it.
Oh, but you forgot the rest.
My dear friends...
...when I came to this country
54 years ago, I had nothing...
...but the heritage of six generations of pretzel benders.
Now I had made up my mind to make a fortune in America.
I knew that I had to do more than just make another pretzel.
So I deliberated and deliberated...
...until I came up with the solution known...
...around the world as the Hammacher twist.
Twice as much pretzel in one pretzel.
What's holding Guy?
I'll tell you,
That crane's holding him up.
He made one mistake: he tried to do it alone.
So you can shoot from the navel.
- You got 48 hours to clear out.
- Carry the bags, fat boy.
And now, my dear friends,
I invite everybody inside the bar.
The schnapps is on Hammacher.
Shouldn't we have one for Gisborne?
Didn't we give him a short beer?
- Please don't take my cocoa.
- Yes, sir.
- Liqueur in the drawing room.
- Thanks.
I am confident you've arranged everything.
I've rented the auditorium...
...contacted the necessary parties and found painters.
We can't afford any slip-ups.
When Robbo says 48 hours, he doesn't mean 49.
T omorrow will tell the tale.
T omorrow is in the hands of fate, but tonight is all ours.
Oh, I agree.
I don't know what you're going to do with your part of it.
I'm going to sleep.
- Miss Stevens?
- Good night.
Your hat and coat, sir.
Good night.
Ta-ta.
Ta-ta to you too.
- This way out-
- I know the way!
Are you content to raise your children...
- ... in a city run by gangsters?
- No!
Will you let your sons idolize this phony Robin Hood...
...who uses soup kitchens to print counterfeit money?
No!
Thank you. Now I would like to introduce a man who...
...is dedicated to public service.
A great officer of the law.
The man who will lead us...
...in our fight for better government...
...Deputy Sheriff Alvin Potts.
Thank you, Miss Stevens.
May I say that I whole-heartedly support...
...the Women's League for Better Government?
Once a hood, always a hood.
Those with pride in the soup kitchens...
...were shocked to find the kitchens were fronts...
...for a large counterfeiting ring.
The leopard, it seems, cannot change his spots.
Read all about it!
Robin Hood a hood!
Paper? I always knew he was a hood.
I must talk to Mr. Jake.
- You knit one and you purl two.
- Okay.
Otherwise you drop a stitch, you know-
I insist on talking to Mr. Jake. Y es.
Give me that.
I don't want any trouble with you bums down there.
Go clean up that soup kitchen.
We run a charity.
I can't work for two bosses.
That dame called this morning...
...and she said not to stop, and not take orders from nobody.
Everybody against the wall.
Hello. Hello!
He hung up on me. Let's go down there, make a few ripples.
- Holy mackerel!
- Those little-
Close it and lock it.
You're gonna let them do that?
I can fight hoods or cops, but not the people.
Me first.
I forgot my knitting.
Oh, dear.
Merry Christmas! Thank you!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Ho, ho. Merry Christmas, thank you.
- Let's get coffee.
- Let's see if the boss wants any.
Ho, ho, ho, merry Christmas!
How about some coffee?
- I'm treating.
- Where'd you get the money?
- Some guy missed the bucket.
- Follow me.
Ain't that the dame's outfit?
Yeah, "WLBG. "
- They must be doing good.
- Yeah, come on.
Happy Yuletide, gentlemen.
This wet snow infuriates me...
...but I can't wear galoshes with evening clothes.
Why, that dirty-
Hey, we blow this job, we won't have a pot.
- What happened to Potts?
- He must be in there.
Happy Yuletide, Mr. Potts.
You've got to climb Mount Everest...
... to reach the Valley of the Dolls.
It's a brutal climb to reach that peak.
You stand there, waiting for the rush
of exhilaration, but it doesn't come.
You're alone.
And the feeling of loneliness
is overpowering.
I never meant to start that climb.
I took the first step when I left
New England and headed for New York.
It wasn't easy to leave
that wonderful house.
My grandparents lived there
and theirs before them.
It was standing during the Revolution.
George Washington didn't sleep there,
but he did dip water from our well.
I can still see them
standing there waving.
Aunt Amy, Mama and Willie.
Poor Willie. He didn't know
I was leaving his life forever.
I'll never forget the night I told them
I was going to New York.
They said it was a dreadful place
for a vacation.
I announced I was going to work there.
Willie took it well.
He said he'd give me a month...
... and I'd run for home
ready to settle down in Lawrenceville.
I remember the day Willie pinned me.
He said it meant
we were engaged to be engaged.
I wanted a marriage like Mom and Dad's,
but not yet.
First I wanted new experiences,
new faces, new surroundings.
Lawrenceville would be there forever.
The cab driver kept complaining
about the sleet and slush.
I told him he should see
one of our New England blizzards.
He took me to the
Martha Washington Hotel for women.
Aunt Amy had stayed there.
She said it was as safe as you
could be in a city like New York.
The desk clerk warned me
they didn't allow men in the rooms.
I confessed I didn't know any.
Before my feet were dry,
the agency sent me on an interview.
I had butterflies, but I acted like
I'd done it all my life.
At least I thought I did.
I knew it. She had that look.
- I'm to see Miss Steinberg.
I knew she was pregnant.
Certainly I should have kept an eye on her, doctor, but she sneaks out.
I haven't any idea who the father is.
It could have been one of several.
All right. I'll start her on vitamins tomorrow.
Queeny's pregnant again.
My Siamese.
I hope it isn't that beat-up black tom with the one eye.
A black Siamese should be very pretty.
I'm Anne Welles.
Oh, yes. The agency phoned about you.
B.A. At Radcliffe? Mr. Bellamy will like that. He'll think it gives the office tone.
- The agency said he's a lawyer.
- A theatrical lawyer.
He handles actors, writers and directors. Important ones.
He advises them and draws up their contracts. No loopholes.
- Sounds fascinating.
- It isn't.
- Will I work for Bellamy or Bellows?
- There is no Mr. Bellows anymore.
Only his nephew, Lyon Burke.
You can tell when he's in the office...
...by the girls around that water cooler.
- How's your shorthand?
- Weak, but I type 60 words a minute.
Okay, I'll take you in to see the boss.
Mr. Bellamy, this is Miss Welles.
She's here about the job.
- She's too good-looking.
- Mr. Bellamy, that's not fair.
I'll just get her broken in and she'll get married.
- I'm already engaged.
- There, see?
Lots of secretaries are married, aren't they?
Not in this office. Some days you'll work until midnight...
...having dinner with me and a client.
I'll drink too much...
...and won't remember a word. You'll have one sherry and remember it all.
- I have a good memory and love sherry.
- Can you handle it?
- I'm sure I can.
- Could she start right away?
- Stop running my life. I'm not convinced.
- Couldn't you please give me a trial?
All right. I'll try you out for one week, starting as of now.
Here. Take these contracts to Helen
Lawson at the rehearsal hall on 44th.
Take a cab. See that she signs them.
- Let's see if she can handle that.
- I'll be right back.
And don't give her that "I loved you when I was a little girl" routine...
...or she'll stab you in the back.
Helen Lawson?
Mr. Bellamy, that was wicked.
Twelve bucks an hour for 80 people, are you kidding? Come on.
Excuse me.
- Yeah.
- I have some contracts for Miss Lawson.
- Go down the hall and turn left.
First dressing room on the right.
If you're a Capricorn, watch your step.
Yeah, Harry, it's a good company.
Come on.
- Why? Why? Why!
- That's it.
- Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two...
You're sorry?
No good.
Lousy. A beast.
Out.
What kind of a press agent are you?
Why did they send me some green kid fresh out of NYU?
- Who in hell are you?
- I'm Anne Welles. And I...
Look, I'm tired and I'm busy.
What do you want?
Mr. Bellamy sent some contracts for you to sign.
You, out.
Come on.
Give me a fountain pen.
And not one of those lousy ballpoints.
Come on.
Sit down. You're making me nervous.
That girl who is singing out there, she's very good, isn't she?
Yeah.
How do you think the kid's song works in the new spot? Great, huh?
The song goes.
- What?
- You heard me, the song goes.
- And the kid with it.
- Come on, Neely O'Hara can't hurt you.
You bet your ass she can't.
Because she isn't gonna get the chance.
The only hit that comes out of my show is Helen Lawson.
And that's me, baby, remember?
- She has a run-of-the-play contract.
- I know about run-of-the-play contracts.
This won't help you in the business.
Right. Nor you, either.
So get Bellamy to do it.
He knows how. He's done it before.
You, go back and tell that son of a bitch to get off his butt and earn his oats.
- But you haven't signed the contracts.
- And I don't intend to.
Not until Bellamy ties a can to that little broad's tail.
Mr. Bellamy.
I've thought it over and I don't think I...
- Oh.
...want this job.
Excuse me. You must be Mr. Burke, the one with the water cooler.
- I mean...
- And you must be Miss Welles.
Mr. Bellamy told me all about you.
Tell me, why are you dismissing us so soon?
- Because I think show business is cruel.
- You're quite right. Have a seat.
- People do despicable things.
- Yes, they certainly do.
Like firing a girl because a crude person like Miss Lawson resents her ability.
Please, have a seat.
Miss Welles, a raw recruit always dives for cover at the first burst of enemy fire.
But don't let that happen to you.
Don't you throw in the towel just yet.
This is a rather cruel business. But it's also a great and rewarding business.
For every Helen Lawson, there's always a Helen Hayes or a Mary Martin.
Now you think about that.
- Well, may I have the contracts?
- Yes.
- They are signed?
- Oh... Well, one is.
Yes, yes. One is.
And legibly too.
I almost forgot. She gave me a message for Mr. Bellamy.
- Yes?
- She said...
- Well, she said, "Tell that son of a..."
- Gun?
- Gun. "Tell him to get off his..."
- Yes, I think I know that message.
I'll see to it that Mr. Bellamy gets it.
Thank you very much, Miss Welles.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Miss Welles, you forgot your purse.
Thank you.
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
I'm afraid I haven't made a good impression.
On the contrary, you've made an indelible one.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
"Barely Pink."
Hey, look at Jennifer.
Hey, Jennifer?
Six hundred bucks for a headdress and not a soul will see it.
- I feel a little top-heavy.
- Honey, you are a little top-heavy.
All right, that's fine, dear.
Thank you.
Hold it. Hold it!
Cut the song?
- The show is a little long.
- Wait a minute!
That's the best piece of music in the show.
- Take out one of Miss Lawson's songs.
- Miss Lawson is the star.
- The public pays to see her.
- But I'll have nothing but a few lines left.
- I'm sorry, Neely. We have no alternative.
Don't listen to him.
He's protecting Old Ironsides.
This was her idea.
She can't stand the competition.
- Let's skip the personalities.
- You've got a run-of-the-play contract.
They'll pay me $200 a week to sit in my dressing room?
They've got to, Miss O'Hara.
If that's the way you want it.
Personally, I'd walk away with dignity.
There'll always be another show and a better part...
...providing you have talent.
Talent? You know damn well she has talent!
Believe me, by next week every producer in town will be after you.
It gives you stature to walk out on Helen Lawson.
Don't listen. They want you to quit so they can save 200 bucks a week.
- Call your agent.
I know her agent.
I can tell you what he'll say.
"Take whatever crumbs are offered."
He's not about to give up his lousy 10 percent.
If she were my client, I'd advise her to leave the show with dignity.
Well, he's not gonna get his lousy 10 percent.
Because I won't settle for crumbs.
I'll leave this stinking show...
...with dignity.
You can call Helen Lawson.
Tell her the SOB earned his oats.
We could all use a little fresh air.
Come on.
I had such big plans.
I was gonna be a big star.
I was gonna take acting lessons and dancing lessons.
Now I don't even have a job.
All I have is my dignity.
Honey, I'm sorry.
That old witch ought to be boiled in oil.
Thanks, Jen.
Honey, listen. It's a rotten business.
I know. But I love it.
- That poor girl. And she was so good.
- I know.
After she signs the release the song will go back in. With the understudy.
Go to the office. On my desk you'll find a musical arrangement.
Get it to Miss O'Hara and tell her to learn it fast.
- She'll be singing it tonight.
- Suppose she won't do it?
- I wouldn't.
- Then make her.
One of the nice things about doing this telethon...
...in addition to raising money, is discovering new talent.
I think you'll love our next performer.
Let's have a nice reception...
...for lovely Neely O'Hara.
Everybody, let's hear it out there.
Thank you very much.
You're right. It is an exciting business.
How about that? Where are you going?
Neely, you'll raise a lot of money for us.
Tell Frank, Dean and Sam they're gonna have to wait.
Thank you.
- Dom Perignon, 1959.
- Fine.
The closest I ever got to champagne was seeing it broken on a ship in a newsreel.
- Welcome, folks.
- Hello, Frank.
- Lyon.
- Hello.
- Miss O'Hara.
Hello.
I caught the telethon. We're doing great business with Tony Polar.
So I see.
Excuse me.
Frank.
There's Jennifer with one of her rich boyfriends. Doesn't she look great?
She's lovely.
- I bet beads pop off when she moves.
- Vodka and tonic.
- Same for me. Make it two.
Neely, I have some good news. You're following Tony Polar in the club here.
- Oh, Lyon!
- Neely, how wonderful.
You'll have to build an act fast, because I exaggerated a bit.
- I told Frank you already had one.
- I will. I will.
- Miriam's not gonna like that.
- Who's Miriam?
- His sister. Over there.
- She manages him.
She does very well.
He won't make a move without her.
He's making one now.
- Friend of yours?
- Never saw her before.
- But I'm gonna see her again.
- How many times do I have to tell you?
- At night, all cats are gray.
- You worry too much.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
I haven't snitched milk since I was a kid in Pittsburgh.
There were six of us and I never got enough.
I can't stop thinking about that audience tonight.
You don't know how it feels, Mel, when they all applaud and whistle.
- They did whistle, didn't they?
- They sure did.
I felt like they were all taking me in their arms and holding me.
It's like when you put your hands on me...
...only it was double-triple.
This place is too small.
I'm gonna get a bigger place.
Maybe two rooms and a kitchenette.
Mel, let's get married.
I thought you'd never ask.
I'm not kidding.
I'll be making good money.
And with your 150 a week, we can really live. We can get a maid to clean up.
We can get a mink coat.
Well, right now you better get a good night's sleep.
So give me a double-triple.
Hello?
Yes, I'll accept the call.
Hello, Mother. I just got in.
I thought it was too late to call you.
But I just sent you $50 last week, Mother.
Okay, I'll send you $50 as soon as I get my paycheck.
You told me Gran's been sick, and I know about the oil burner.
I'll take the mink to Uncle Ayers' again.
He'll give me a couple hundred for it.
Mother, I know I don't have any talent...
...and I know all I have is a body and I am doing my bust exercises.
Goodbye, Mother. I'll wire you the money first thing in the morning.
Oh, to hell with them. Let them droop.
Look, the models have goose bumps.
Yes, and come July they'll be sweltering in mink.
You must be frozen.
- Are you sure you wanna walk?
- Positive.
Oh, how beautiful.
Oh, no. Sorry. Jewelry's not for you.
Maybe one single strand of pearls.
But not creamy.
Pink, to match your skin.
And don't expect flowers either, because only white lilacs suit you.
And they're very difficult to come by in New York in February.
But make a note, remind me to send you some in May.
- Are you wooing me, Mr. Burke?
- If you wish to be wooed.
What about that fraternity pin you wear?
That's Sigma Chi, isn't it?
- Deke.
- Oh, Deke. Yes.
It can mean everything or nothing.
Then I'll settle for nothing.
Did you know you are the most beautiful girl that ever left lipstick in my office?
- You like women, don't you?
- I like career girls. We're compatible.
- It's said they don't make good wives.
- I'm not looking for a wife.
Some men just don't pull well in double harness.
You're fortunate. You know yourself.
I don't know who I am or what I want.
I only know I have to find out.
Off-stage I hate her, but on-stage I'm madly in love with her.
- Do you think it's a hit?
- It is with me.
But we'll have to wait until
4 a.m. For the reviews.
4 a. m? Good heavens, what do we do until then?
We could go to Helen's hotel suite, listen to four-letter words and wait.
I have a better idea.
My father used to come here when he was at Yale.
Well, I'm an Oxford man myself.
I know all about you.
You do?
- I know your mother was English...
...she was an ingénue at the Drury Lane
Theatre and you look exactly like her.
Well, not exactly, I hope.
And when your uncle died, you took over his business.
Oh, good old Steinberg.
Well, what would you like to have?
- Sherry, please.
- Good. Two sherries.
Did she also tell you that I once thought that I could write?
Oh, I'm sure you could. You turn a very neat phrase when you dictate.
Oh?
You know, I'm beginning to like the agency business.
Every man a potential Henry Higgins waiting to discover his Eliza Doolittle.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's funny.
I used to come here weekends, but tonight it's not the same.
No noisy students, no drinking songs.
It seems the two of us are alone in the world.
We are. You know that.
I've known it for a long time.
Beautiful.
Now, you call this acting?
Actually, this is a celebration.
I've been talking with the Coast.
They wanna test you and Tony out there next week.
Oh.
I have the scenes right here.
And a song, a really good one.
- Yes?
- Excuse me.
- Telephone for you. It's your Aunt Amy.
- I'll call back.
She says it's very important she speak to you.
Something must be wrong.
Excuse me.
Mother's not been well.
Miriam, here's a copy for Tony.
Incidentally, where is Tony?
Well, I know who he's with, but I don't know where. I can't reach him.
Well, find him.
I know you owe Miriam a lot, Tony...
...but I wish we didn't have to meet in such out-of-the-way places.
I'll bet I'm the only showgirl who's ever been inside the Statue of Liberty.
Honey, it's just that Miriam doesn't want me to get serious.
Are you serious, Tony?
You know I am, baby.
But Miriam's got this thing about marriage.
She thinks it'll destroy what she calls my image.
And there's something else.
I've never quite been able to put my finger on it.
Maybe she's jealous.
No, not Miriam. She raised me.
Did without.
Worked like a dog to get me my singing lessons.
Maybe that's why she's so careful with money.
We always had so little.
Yeah. It's the same with us.
When my father died, my mother and grandmother thought I was such a drain.
All I ever heard was how much I ate and how much it cost to buy me shoes.
It got so I panicked when I thought my shoes were getting too small.
- It's freezing here.
- It certainly is.
Let's go to your place. We'll unhook the phone so Miriam can't bother us.
How's that? Come on.
Oh...
My mother said
I should've held out...
...and made you marry me.
- Oh, baby.
But when did I ever do anything my mother told me to?
A telegram for a Miss Polar.
One second. You have to sign this.
Thank you.
Dr. Eberhart, this is Miriam Polar.
Yes. I called you because I'm worried.
Tony just got married.
No, I never told him.
I know I should have, but I couldn't.
I couldn't do that to him.
After all, it might not ever happen.
Well, the point is that...
...we'll be leaving for California next week and...
...you'd better give me the name of a doctor there.
I wanted to come for your mother's funeral. Why didn't you let me?
It's my own grief.
I didn't wanna put you through it.
From what you said, she's a wonderful woman.
Yes, she was.
Anne, it's a dream town.
I can almost hear
Paul Revere's hoofbeats.
He passed us by.
There was a scandalous rumor going around we were pro-British.
I'm sorry you missed Aunt Amy. She's gone to the cousins' in New Hampshire.
Everything is better here. It really is. I don't know how you ever left.
- Be careful.
- Hot!
I have an idea. Why don't we leave the rat race and move up here?
I could write my book.
Or at least try.
- You really think you'd be happy?
- Of course I would.
Woods to tramp, river to fish.
This wonderful old house.
And you beside me on that marvelous old four-poster upstairs.
Well, it's a marriage bed, Lyon.
- You were thinking of marriage?
- Well, you know how I feel about that.
When you fall in love, you belong to someone else.
We've gone through this before.
How do you think I feel sneaking out of your apartment at 4:00 in the morning?
But you don't have to sneak.
And don't tell me I knew what I was doing.
But you did. You knew.
But I loved you.
Does it make any difference how or why it happened? It happened.
And for that I'm grateful.
Come on.
Come on.
You think I could sleep with you, here in this house?
No, I guess you couldn't.
I guess I should've known.
You're afraid of ghosts.
I'm not. And none of them ever loved each other more than I love you.
- But not enough to marry me.
- But that's beside the point.
I'll get you a cab.
You can stay at the hotel.
All right.
You do that.
- Lyon Burke, please.
- I'm sorry, Miss Welles. He checked out.
He left this for you.
Johnny was just going to bring it over.
Dear Anne, thank you
for the moment of reckoning.
You once said I knew
who I was and what I wanted.
I've always wanted to write.
So I'm going back to England...
... find the counterpart
of Lawrenceville and see if I can.
Somewhere in your wonderful New York
there is the right man...
... just waiting for you to find him.
Thank you for the loveliest winter
of my life.
Lyon.
- How was lunch?
- I wasn't very hungry.
- Mr. Bellamy wanted cigarettes.
- Oh, not now.
He's got a big new account in there.
Say, I still have one of Queeny's kittens left. Would you like to have it?
It's a male, honey.
It won't give you any trouble.
A male in the
Martha Washington Hotel for women?
You could always move.
- Yes, Mr. Bellamy?
Send in Miss Welles.
- Who's he with?
- Kevin Gillmore.
He made a mint with that new hairspray.
Miss Welles.
Take this down, please:
Point number one.
The girl who introduces our products on our show will be called the Gillian Girl.
Two.
She must be beautiful, but more important, she must be refined.
Cultured.
A girl like Miss Welles here.
- That's not a girl. That's my secretary.
- We don't want artificial beauty.
We want the kind that our audience can identify with.
College girl.
Young matron will think she'll look like you if she uses our product.
- I'm flattered, Mr.?
- Gillmore.
- But I'm not an actress.
- I don't want an actress.
I want an unknown. A girl to be identified with Gillian products exclusively.
- I will start her off at $300 a week.
- Gillmore, that's sabotage.
It's also very tempting.
Why don't we have dinner and talk it over?
Okay, but bring the contract to me before you sign it.
KNBC, Los Angeles.
Celebrating the second anniversary
of the Gillian Girl...
... Gillian products offers
a Gillian Girl's birthday special.
Gillian high-fashion makeup.
Gillian high-fashion lipstick.
Helps soothe natural curls
as it sets your hair.
After your shampoo just comb,
roll up, then brush out.
Gillian makeup gives grace and elegance
to that high-fashioned look.
Gillian makeup gives you just enough
accent to that flawless complexion.
Hello?
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Hello, Mother? How are you?
Yes, I'm watching too.
Remember, the beautiful people
use Gillian's.
She looks lovely.
She's coming to California next week.
I'll be seeing her.
I know she's making big money.
Mother, I can't send you any more money this month.
Miriam has me on a strict budget.
Of course she's still living with us. You know that.
If that's long distance, don't hang on the phone. You know how much it costs.
Mom, I've gotta go now.
I'll write you tomorrow.
Okay. Bye.
Continuing our presentation...
... of the Grammy Awards,
coming to you...
... from the Grand Ballroom of the Hilton
Hotel in the heart of New York City.
Presently on the stage,
about to present a major award...
... is the toastmaster general
of the United States, Mr. George Jessel.
And now... Now a special award
for Miss Neely O'Hara.
Hey, Miriam. Come and look.
It's old home week.
Just a few short years ago you're an
unknown little girl singing for her supper.
And now, because of the warm,
plush, lush notes that emerged from...
... your fair throat, you've become the
idol of movie fans and record buyers...
... all over the United States of America.
With the same elation that I felt when
I shook the hands of the great Caruso...
... I happily present to you this Grammy
Award for your warm contribution...
... to the recording industry.
Thank you, Mr. Jessel.
I'd like to thank all of you here...
... and all of you out there
who made this possible.
Don't forget to see my new film Love and
Let Love at the Music Hall this week.
- I sing some great new songs in it.
- Oh, good.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Neely.
- Annie!
Congratulations.
- Thank you. How long has it been?
It's been too long. I'd like you to meet
Kevin Gillmore. This is Neely O'Hara.
- How do you do?
- And her husband.
- How do you do?
- We're going to the Coast.
- Maybe we can get together.
- Give me a call.
I'd like to see how Gillian's hairspray reacts to smog.
- Good to see you, Anne. Mr. Gillmore.
- It's nice to have met you.
Hey, you know something?
I've never carried you across the threshold.
Oh.
Thanks, I need it.
Hold that, honey.
- You have a hard day?
- A brute.
Sit down, will you?
I might as well give it to you all at once.
The studio dropped my option.
So what? There are other studios.
You should've never done Westerns.
You're a romantic lead.
Sure, sure.
Look! You're a singer.
You can always go back to nightclubs.
- I don't wanna go back to nightclubs.
- Will you do me a favor?
- Will you not worry about it?
- He doesn't wanna go back.
- He wants to make pictures.
- I'm gonna heat up the lasagna.
Boy, can I go for a drink.
Me too. It's charming.
Would you care for cocktails?
- Two martinis.
Ma'am?
- Glass of red wine.
I'll have a scotch and soda.
Thank you.
Pardon me, Beth.
Hello, Anne. Welcome to California.
- Jennifer.
- Lyon.
- Tony, good to see you.
- Nice to see you again, Lyon.
- Lyon Burke, Kevin Gillmore.
- Hello.
How do you do?
- Well, how long will you be in town?
Not half long enough.
Just two days, then I'm taking Anne to Hawaii.
Wonderful. You'll love it.
- Incidentally, how did you like my book?
- I haven't read it.
Oh, you should.
It's dedicated to you.
I'll send you a copy.
Well, I hope you enjoy your stay.
If there's anything I can do while you're here, please let me know.
You're too late, Lyon.
We saw them first.
Thanks just the same.
- Not at all.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Well, I think I'll have the butterfly steak.
Hi, Mel!
- The door was open.
Jenny, how are you?
- It's good to see you.
- Oh, lovely to see you.
Sit down.
Neely's at the studio.
- Oh, I thought she had a few weeks off.
- Two weeks until she starts shooting.
And wardrobe fittings, makeup tests, publicity stills, you know.
You don't suppose there's a part for Tony in the picture, do you?
You can ask her, Jen, but I wouldn't count on it.
She'll be home any minute. She's with
Ted Casablanca trying on new clothes.
Only in Hollywood do women faint...
...because some queer deigns to design their clothes.
Maybe you could put in a good word for Tony.
Me? She doesn't listen to me.
I'm the last person to ask her.
She's changed, Jen.
She starts at 5:30 in the morning still punchy from last night's sleeping pills.
So she takes a red pill to pep herself up and at midnight she's still flying.
- I try to talk to her, it's like a brick wall.
- Well...
...I guess that's one of the drawbacks of being a big star.
Hey, you know what these are?
One month's check she has to sign.
All the dough she makes, we still had to borrow to pay the income tax.
Attorney, agent, manager, secretary, doctor, maid, masseuse...
...voice coach. She sings like a bird.
- Psychiatrist.
- Psychiatrist?
Oh, yeah, the studio wants her to find out why she's so exhausted.
They say they think it must be emotional conflicts.
Conflicts, my foot.
There aren't enough hours in the day.
The headshrinker says she's insecure.
That she needs mass love.
Maybe I'm lucky
I don't have any talent.
Hi, Jen.
- Mel, get me some skim milk, will you?
- Want something?
I'll have a Coke.
Jen, I don't know what I'm gonna do about Mel. He's changed so.
He just can't seem to get with it.
What do you mean, Neely?
He's gotten you lots of good publicity.
That was the studio.
They told him to butt out.
They don't even want him on the set.
They say he makes me self-conscious.
Ted Casablanca says he's the joke of the town.
I wouldn't pay any attention to that.
You know how bitchy fags can be.
He's not even 30 and he's made over a million bucks.
- Here we go.
- Mel, hand me my bag, will you?
Thank you.
Well, I've lost 5 pounds already.
These pills are really great, Jen.
They kill your appetite.
Only trouble is, they pep me up so much I can't sleep.
Well, what nice, fattening thing did you tell Arlene to make tonight?
Arlene quit this morning.
She said you yelled at her. That's three cooks in three months, Neely.
She was a louse anyway.
You said yourself she was taking home all the booze.
Other people have loyal help, why can't we?
You don't know how to talk to them.
That's your job. You better start running this house properly.
I'm not the butler, Neely.
You're not the breadwinner either.
I'm afraid I better be running along.
- See you soon.
- Bye, Jen.
That was a rotten thing to say in front of Jenny.
Why?
She knows the facts of life.
You two sit around on your rumps all day while Tony and I slave.
I can get off my rump and go back to New York.
- I can always get my old job back.
- Suit yourself.
I'm too tired to argue.
I've got to take a shower and get back to Ted's.
You know you're spending a lot more time than necessary with that fag.
Ted Casablanca is not a fag.
And I'm the dame who can prove it.
Thanks for making up my mind.
I should've left long ago...
...but I kept remembering the old Neely.
She was quite a girl.
Now you're just like all the rest of them.
Success is too big for you.
If you ask me, my success is too big for you.
Yeah, sure.
Sure it is.
I'll just take this. It's the only thing around here that belongs to me.
I wrote about the things I knew.
My own experiences.
But I guess I only had one book in me.
- Was I really that naive?
- Naive and wonderful.
I missed you, Anne.
Oh, I went back to the agency business.
And I like it.
- Incidentally, Neely's one of my clients.
- Really?
I don't know. England's changed.
Or I've changed.
The nightingale somehow just sounded off-key.
I used to pretend you'd gone bald and fat.
I pictured you at a sink full of dishes. And a baby tugging at your skirt.
Are you really going to marry Kevin?
I was, but now I realize it's impossible.
I'm glad.
You know, every girl
I met always washed out.
Just couldn't stand up to your image.
I am not taking you to a bistro.
I'm taking you home to bed.
- As in sleep, which you need.
- Miss O'Hara?
Yes?
- Would you autograph my program?
Of course.
There's Neely with Casablanca.
- Where?
- Over there.
Let's try and catch up to them.
- Thank you.
- Darling, let's leave.
Here comes Tony Polar.
He's gonna put the bite on me for a job.
I could've sworn Neely saw us.
Well, she's near-sighted, darling.
She can't see 10 feet in front of her.
Yeah.
Tony! Are you okay?
I don't know.
My legs just seemed to give way.
- Happened the other day on the set.
- I think you ought to see a doctor.
No, I'm all right. Come on.
Tony!
- Jen.
- Tony! Tony.
Tony.
There.
- He'll sleep for a while.
He didn't know me.
- He didn't know where he was.
- Go out. The doctor will explain it to you.
It's called Huntington's chorea.
It's relatively rare.
Unfortunately, there is no cure.
The symptoms of physical and mental degeneration first appear about age 30.
There's a loss of muscular control.
Chances for inheritance are very high.
Tony's father had it.
I kept hoping it wouldn't hit Tony.
Now you can see why I was against his marrying.
- Will he be able to walk again?
- As soon as the sedation wears off.
But the motor disturbances will occur again.
And there will be periods of blankness and hallucination.
It may take a year before he reaches the point of complete incapacity.
- Are there any further questions?
- No.
Good night, Mrs. Polar.
If he becomes unmanageable, we'll keep him sedated.
He probably won't remember any of this tomorrow. Good night.
Good night.
Jen?
Maybe you'll understand now why
I've been the way I've been.
Money, for instance. I've put away every cent I could get my hands on.
We'll keep him at home as long as we can.
- What about you?
- Tony and I had different fathers.
I know how you love him.
I'm not blind. I thank you.
Miriam, I'm pregnant.
This way, Miss O'Hara.
This way.
Another.
This way.
What about Casablanca?
- Miss O'Hara has nothing to say.
Are you gonna marry?
Any comment?
- What about Ted Casablanca?
- You heard me. No comment.
Have any marriage plans?
What's your next film?
Tony didn't realize where he was.
The next day Miriam arranged a meeting
with a quirky European movie producer.
Mr. Chardot, this is my sister-in-law.
Mr. Chardot is from Paris.
He's out here looking for talent.
Mademoiselle Polar has shown me your photographie.
I am interested in a young lady with your...
- How you say?
- Measurements.
In general, the French girl is inclined to be flat in the bosom.
I see. Just what kind of pictures do you make?
I make art films.
- I've seen a few. They're pretty raw.
French subtitles over a bare bottom doesn't make it art.
Evil is only in the eye of the beholder.
- My films are shown in your country.
- Jennifer...
...you've posed undraped on the stage.
- That was before I married Tony.
It's up to you.
Tony wouldn't know the difference.
Well, I would.
I realized I had to give in
and take the job.
The sanitarium was very expensive.
All right, sheriff, you win.
You ran my father out of town...
...now you're trying to run me out.
The Durneys don't give up that easy.
- It's too hot!
- Cut.
Stand by.
- Well, it's too damn hot.
- The cameraman's frying me.
Neely?
- Shut up!
- She's full of sauce.
It's not booze, it's pills.
Send for her husband. Look, Neely...
...we've got to finish this take.
- Get lost. I'm through for the day.
Get off the floor.
You're making a spectacle of yourself.
- Zip up your dress.
I can't.
- It's bloat from those pills and booze.
I haven't had a drink all day.
You're going out there and doing the scene.
How long do you think you can get away with these antics?
Come on.
Give this to the hairdresser.
Miss O'Hara will be ready in a moment.
I wanna see Mr. Burke.
- He's not in, Miss O'Hara.
"He's not in." That's all I've heard at his office for three days.
He's ducking me. He's giving me the treatment, just like all the others.
- Where's Miss Welles?
He is in San Francisco, Neely.
Tell me something.
How come the boss of a big agency...
...spends three days in San Francisco with a lousy nightclub singer?
He's working overtime.
Why doesn't he look after my interests?
- I'm the one who pays his rent.
- You're being obnoxious.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I want Lyon to talk to that director.
He's crucifying me.
- When's he due back?
- I'm not sure.
When a man says he won't do a scene, that's called integrity.
When a woman says it, she's temperamental.
They say I'm difficult.
They say I'm drunk even when I'm not.
Sure, I take dolls, I gotta sleep.
I gotta get up at 5 in the morning and sparkle.
- It's bad to take liquor with those pills.
- They work faster.
Here. With that guy of yours in
San Francisco you could use a few dolls.
No, thanks.
Suit yourself.
You should make him marry you.
- Have you heard from Jennifer?
- Yeah.
She called me about six months ago.
You know what she asked me?
She wanted to know where she could get an abortion.
An abortion. How do you like that?
She was the one who wanted kiddies and the vine-covered cottage.
Then I heard she went to Paris to make art films.
Art films.
Nudies, that's all they are. Nudies.
That's her problem. She doesn't care about me, so why care about her?
- Nobody cares about me.
- That's not so!
Nobody cares if I live or die, just so long as I write the checks.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
You're a big star. You have everything.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I'm a big star.
I'm a big star.
I tell myself that, Annie, but I don't feel it.
I don't feel anything anymore.
I haven't slept with Ted in weeks.
And that psychiatrist? Dr. Mitchell?
Dr. Mitchell says that I am self-destructive.
So what?
What do I do about it?
The hell with them. The hell with all of them. Who needs them?
Let them talk. Even the bad publicity helps when you're as big as I am.
- And, boy, am I getting the bad publicity.
- You've had enough of those.
- Now, try to calm down.
- Leave me alone!
I can't even remember when somebody wasn't nagging or pressuring me.
You're upset.
Why don't you lie down for a while?
No...
...not alone...
...not anymore.
I need a man to hold me.
I need Mel.
I mean Ted.
I'm going home, Annie.
I'm going home to Ted right now.
Thanks for listening.
I really got a lot off my chest.
Ted? Honey, it's me.
It's not cold, huh?
Do you think she can hear us?
- Relax. She's so full of pills and booze...
...the San Francisco Earthquake couldn't rouse her.
Having fun, kiddies?
Don't mind me, go right ahead.
I'll watch.
You'd better run, you little tramp.
How dare you contaminate my pool?!
Here, maybe this will disinfect it.
All right, faggot, start explaining.
You need glasses, Neely.
She's hardly built like a boy.
- I could take that better.
- I'm sure you could.
- You almost made me feel I was queer.
- You're crazy.
- Am I?
- Yes, you are.
You want me to fight your studio battles, take you to openings...
As a man, you're always too tired and too full of those damn dolls.
You've got guts. I catch you red-handed with a naked broad...
...and you sermonize me!
- Not a sermon, just a few cold facts.
When I come home, I'm exhausted.
How can I think of sex?
Then why'd you sign the new contract?
You don't have to work. I make enough.
You've got your new deal and I have my sanity back.
With that little whore?
That little whore makes me feel 9 feet tall.
- Please don't. I need you.
- You're damn right you do...
...but not as a man.
You can go to hell.
Go to hell, you bastard!
I tried to wake her, Mr. Burke, but she wouldn't budge.
All right, thank you.
Neely. Neely.
Neely, wake up.
Come on, wake up.
You were due on the set three hours ago.
- What set?
- Why didn't you show up?
I couldn't, Lyon. I had a rotten night.
- I want to tell you something.
- Stop yelling.
- They're replacing you.
- They can't do that.
- It so happens they can.
- My last picture grossed a fortune.
It cost more than it grossed, because of you.
And now you've been out six days because of pills and you walked out.
And you've been boozing and eating all through the picture.
- I'm the biggest box-office draw there is.
- Come on, get some sense in your head.
Stockholders are only interested in one thing: Profits.
They're gonna replace you with a younger girl.
- Younger? Lyon, I'm 26.
- And you look 36.
Look at that face. It's all puffy.
Your eyes are bloodshot.
Thank you very much.
I'm sorry, but I can't stand by and watch a talent like yours go down the drain.
You're my agent.
You're supposed to take care of me.
I'm trying to, but you've gotta cooperate with me.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to go to a sanitarium and dry out.
- A sanitarium?
- I'm sorry. It's the only solution.
Look, you just have to beat this thing.
You just have to beat it.
All right.
- All right. If you want me to go, I'll go.
- Good.
Anne and I will come by and pick you up at about 3:00.
United Airlines?
What time is your next flight to San Francisco?
Yes, one. O'Hara.
- What do you say, baby?
- What do you mean, "baby"?
I'm Neely O'Hara, pal.
That's me singing on that jukebox.
What are you, kidding? That dame's great. You sound like a frog.
Like a frog...
- Take it easy. She's stoned!
- Get out of here!
Who's stoned?
I'm merely traveling incognito.
Well, get out of here, will you?
Go on, get out of here.
Jennifer, shame on you.
Still got that mole on your keister?
Nope. They covered it up with makeup.
Boobies, boobies, boobies.
Nothing but boobies.
Who needs them?
I did great without them.
Who the hell are you?
Who are you?!
Neely?
Neely.
- How do you feel, honey?
- Fine.
It's a hospital.
- What am I doing in the hospital?
- You took an overdose of pills.
Oh, God...
- Did it get in the papers?
- Lyon told them it was accidental.
- Well, it was. It was. Honest.
- I know.
But the next time you might not be so lucky.
What am I gonna do?
We want you to go to a sanitarium in Los Angeles.
- A nuthouse?
No.
- It's the same place Tony is in.
- I'm not nutty. I'm just hooked on dolls.
- It's not a nuthouse.
- Getting off them is worse than dope.
I'm scared. I've forgotten how to sleep without dolls.
I can't get through a day without a doll.
Please, Lyon, don't send me there.
I need a doll.
Lyon, don't leave me here!
Get me a doll. Just one.
Well, this is by far the best we've made.
Fox would like to release the film in the United States.
They have also offered to buy your contract.
- Does that mean I can go home?
- I'm not sure I wish to sell.
- Look, Claude, you'll make lots of money.
- True, but you will get half.
- I just want to go back and see Tony.
- What use is a man...
...who is no longer a man? A vegetable.
- Claude, please, stop it.
I've hated this.
Go find yourself another girl.
Yes, I can. Younger. A real actress.
- For what will you settle?
- Settle? I want my half.
Then I will not sell.
All right, I'll settle for a third.
Anything. Just let me go home.
Anything? Well, perhaps we can make some arrangement.
We'll talk about it later...
...at the apartment.
I cursed you out at first, but then I realized you did the right thing.
It was the only thing.
- I couldn't sleep that night.
You should have taken a doll.
No. I'm really very grateful.
Nobody else gave a damn.
That's not true. There was a flood of letters and telegrams from all over.
We saved them for you.
Thanks.
At first it was awful, like living in a zoo.
The stuck me in this little room
with a big nurse with orthopedic shoes...
... who never left my side.
I asked for a cigarette.
- Give me a cigarette.
- Two a day during social hour.
I told her I had no intention of socializing with kooks.
I couldn't sleep. I needed a pill.
I started screaming. I figured they'd give me something to calm me.
They sure did.
Get off me, you...
Let go of me!
Let go!
They ordered me to take off my gown.
I told them to drop dead.
They took it off for me.
No!
Then they stuck me in this big tub and hooked a canvas around me.
This young nurse sat there and wrote down everything I said.
I used words that sure aren't
in medical books.
You stupid-ass nurse!
What are you looking at?
Actually, the water felt great.
It kept coming in and going out.
I wanted to lie back and relax.
But that was what they wanted.
I spotted this small hole in the canvas.
I started working at it with my toe.
I got half my foot through it,
then I yanked my knee up to my chest.
Ow! Ow! Oh, God, it hurts.
The nurse sounded the alarm.
In the afternoon we had recreation hour.
You never saw such a bunch
of well-bred kooks.
They all acted as normal as apple pie.
I started playing checkers
with this cute little girl.
All of a sudden she gets me
in a half nelson...
... and accuses me of telling the rest
of the inmates she's a latent homosexual.
You won't believe what happened next.
Once a week, we have a dance.
It's really camp.
I knew Tony was here
under an assumed name...
... but I'd never seen him,
until one night...
- Do you know "Come Live With Me"?
- Yes, I do.
- Would you play it, please?
- Surely.
Tony. Tony?
When I saw that poor guy being led back to his cell, I knew I was gonna make it.
You have made it, Neely.
And we're proud of you.
Now business. How would you like to do a Broadway musical for David Merrick?
- You think I could?
- You know you could.
Merrick believes in you.
And so do I.
Lyon's checked with the doctors here and they say you can do it.
What about the bad publicity?
It'll create sympathy.
People love to forgive.
Lyon, I'm really in great shape.
I've changed. I've learned a lot of things.
I used to work my heart out, kill myself.
Not anymore.
There are things I want, Lyon.
And I'm gonna get them.
Know something, Annie? One of the first things I'd like to have is your fella.
You better watch out.
- How soon can I see him?
- You should remember him as he was.
I want to see him, Miriam.
All right.
I've booked you into a hotel near the studio.
Why did you write me for a doctor's appointment?
He's already told you everything he knows.
It's not about Tony, it's for me.
It must have been a shock to discover it.
Lots of lumps mean nothing.
Some are only cysts, aren't they?
Yes, but this one wasn't.
The doctor took a biopsy and it's malignant.
- Jen, I'm sorry.
- It's pretty hard to take.
Tomorrow they have to perform a mastectomy.
Doctor says it's not the end of the world.
He says lots of women live long and happy lives after breast surgery.
- The point is to catch it in time.
- I'm sure they will.
Afterwards you can come to the beach with us and recuperate.
I'd love to.
You know, it's funny...
...all I've ever had was a body and now I won't even have that.
Jen, stop talking like that.
How am I gonna keep Tony in the sanitarium?
When I saw him, he didn't even know me.
Lyon will find you a job.
I know he will.
Anne, let's face it, all I know how to do is take off my clothes.
Jen.
Hello? Yes, I placed a call to Milwaukee.
Anne, I'm all right, really I am.
Run along.
I'll stay with you tomorrow.
And don't you worry.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hello, Mother, I had to talk to you.
There's something I have to tell you.
I'm sorry Mrs. Gottlieb was shocked at my pictures.
No, I won't be undressing in public anymore.
What did I have to tell you?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Hello, Mother. I just got in.
I thought it was too late to call you.
But I just sent you $50
last week, Mother.
Okay, I'll send you $50 as soon
as I get my paycheck.
Tony!
- Jen.
- Tony!
Tony! Tony!
Let's go.
- You were the last one to see her alive?
Why would she take her life?
- Was she depressed?
- She was in good spirits.
Any reason why she'd take her own life?
None. She was excited about a new contract.
- So it was accidental?
- Yes, I'm sure.
Her measurements?
- That's enough. That's enough.
Break it up.
Come on, break it up. Break it up
- A drink, a drink, a drink.
- I made one for you. Here.
Thank you.
- What's that?
- Neely's.
Neely's? Well, get rid of them.
Do you have to go to New York with Neely?
Of course. You know I do.
I have to do my best for her.
- Couldn't someone else go?
- No, she wants me.
- She's scared. She needs someone.
- I know.
- Darling, I'm worried.
- Why?
- Neely spells trouble. She thrives on it.
- Yes, but she deserves a comeback.
- I hate to think of you getting involved.
- Don't worry about that.
I can handle her.
I'm not so sure.
Hello?
Annie. Hi, how are you?
Lyon?
I'm sorry, he's in the shower.
I'll have him call you back.
- Where are you going?
- A press party for Helen Lawson.
- Her show's opening on Thursday.
- A party? Without me?
Definitely without you. I'm keeping you under wraps until your opening.
- How's my tie?
- Bend down.
I hear the Lawson show laid a big egg in Philadelphia.
- I wanna go to the party too.
- You're the cutest and the cruelest.
Does anybody else have a better right to gloat?
Baby, you may have a great talent, but not for ties.
Okay.
Curl up with your favorite news analyst.
I'll be back early.
A little closer together, please.
- Have you made many changes?
Oh, yes, quite a few.
Miss O'Hara. You look lovely.
- Thank you.
- Who invited her?
- Nobody.
It's great to have you back in New York. You look marvelous.
I thought you were keeping her out of sight.
Should have kept her in a straitjacket.
- I'm very sorry, Helen.
- I think I'll sit this one out.
What are your plans?
That depends on Lyon Burke...
I said, that depends on Lyon Burke.
He takes care of my affairs.
- And the rumors about you two?
- Marriage plans?
Well, we're both available.
Good evening, Miss Lawson.
Can I help you?
No, thank you.
Who are you hiding from?
The notices couldn't have been that bad.
- The show just needs a little doctoring.
- Don't worry. If it flops...
...you can always understudy for my grandmother.
Thanks. I've already turned down the part you're playing.
Bull. Merrick's not that crazy.
You should know.
You just came out of the nuthouse.
- It was not a nuthouse!
- They drummed you out of Hollywood...
...so you come crawling back to Broadway.
Well, Broadway doesn't go for booze and dope.
Now, get out of my way,
I've got a man waiting.
- That's a switch from the usual fags.
- At least I never married one.
- You take that back, you old fag hag.
- Get your hands off of me.
- Oh, my God! It's a wig.
- Give me back my hair.
- Her hair's as phony as she is.
- Give me that.
Give me that, damn you!
What the hell are you doing in there?
Giving it a shampoo.
Goodbye, pussycat.
She threw it in the can.
I'll kill her!
- It won't even go down the john.
- Give me that wig!
Okay, you want it back?
Here it comes. Special delivery.
So long, granny.
I'll tell your boyfriend not to wait.
How do I get out of here?
You can go through the kitchen.
It's right next door.
Sorry, Miss Lawson. What an awful thing to do to a great star like you.
I'll go out the way I came in.
Not a word about quitting.
The going gets rough, they all talk about retirement.
Not me. I've had it rough before.
I'm a barracuda.
I don't need pills like Neely.
Sure, I know you dried her out, but it won't last.
Neely hasn't got that hard core like me.
She never learned to roll with the punches.
And in this business they come left, right and below the belt.
Neely has no class.
No real down-to-the-gut class.
But she's talented, Henry.
She's really got it.
I knew that when
I kicked her out of my show.
She'd never believe it, but I'm sorry for her.
Nothing can destroy her talent...
...but she'll destroy herself.
And you, Lyon, you'd better watch it.
Sure, everything's rosy now.
You skip from one dame to another.
But watch it, my friend.
Find yourself a good girl.
Have kids.
Or one day you'll wind up alone like me...
...and wonder what the hell happened.
Allison's gotta go. I will not let her steal the show. She almost did at rehearsal.
- It's too late. It can't be done.
- She hasn't got a contract.
She can be fired right now.
I want her out.
The old star sickness begins to appear.
No more gratitude, just power.
I'm not gonna do it, Neely.
You don't fool me, you're scared.
You wanna stay in good with Merrick.
I should've known this was gonna happen. Anne warned me.
What the hell does Anne know?
I didn't get dough handed to me because of my good cheekbones, I worked for it.
She's gone through life on a pass because of her damn looks.
I wanna tell you something.
Everyone gets payback. Everyone!
I'm not everyone. I don't have to live by stinking rules for ordinary people.
I licked pills, booze and the funny farm.
I don't need anybody or anything.
That's good, because I'm leaving.
Who needs you? I'm sick of you.
You're just an agent.
And you're just a Helen Lawson.
And not even that, because she's a professional.
They love Helen Lawson, then they love Neely O'Hara.
Come on, you guys. Move it.
Come on. Let's go, girls.
- Where's Miss O'Hara?
- She's in her dressing room.
Come on, move it down.
Curtain time, Miss O'Hara.
- Miss O'Hara?
- Where is she?
- She won't open up the door.
- Neely?
Open the door, you're on.
Neely?
- Hi.
- That's your costume for the second act.
- I'll do the second act first.
- Quick, get the understudy.
I'm ready, Mr. Hamilton.
You get lost, sister, I'm fine.
I'm just dandy.
Let go of me, you big jerk!
It's getting late.
I think we ought to go.
The understudy was great.
Thank you.
What happened to Neely?
Are you kidding?
They said she had laryngitis.
- Who had laryngitis?
That new girl was terrific.
She sure was.
It was a lovely evening, nevertheless.
My beautiful little dolls.
Just one, and one more.
We're closing now, Miss O'Hara.
All right, Edward. All right.
Here. Keep the change.
Shall I call you a cab?
I don't need it.
I don't need anybody.
Because I got talent, Edward.
Big talent.
They love me.
Hey! Where is everybody?
Hey, everybody, where are you?
Where are you?
Gone.
Gone.
Everybody's gone.
The hell with them.
Who needs them?
The whole world loves me!
Where are you?
Lyon?
Anne?
Jennifer?
Ted!
Mel.
Oh, God...
God...
God?
I'm Neely.
Neely O'Hara!
Oh, Neely.
Neely! Neely!
For so many years
I prayed for this moment.
Now that it's come,
I don't feel a thing.
Does that mean you won't marry me?
It wouldn't work, Lyon.
Isn't there anything I can do to change your mind?
No, Lyon, not now.
Anne.
Perhaps someday, Lyon.
I don't know.
Goodbye.
Summer's here, it's a holiday
School is out, now it's time to play
Just get the schoolbooks out of reach
We're gonna go to Bikini Beach
That's it, that's right
That's where the fun is at
That's it, that's right
All the chicks are bikini clad
Oh, yeah!
That's it, that's right
That's where the fun is at
That's it, that's right
All the chicks are bikini clad
We're on our own, we're on our way
The gang's all heading for a holiday
A lot of girls and a guy for each
Come on let's go to Bikini Beach
That's it, that's right
That's where the fun is at
That's it, that's right
All the chicks are bikini clad!
That's it, that's right
Keep the short shorts out of sight
That's it, that's right
Gonna be, who needs short shorts?
Beach party tonight
That's right
Come on. Let's hit it!
Come on, let's go.
This should keep the wolves away from our door.
Hey, isn't there some way we can lock this thing?
From the inside or the outside?
What's the matter, Animal, don't you trust the boys?
It isn't that. I don't trust me.
Hey, Candy, who do you have to know to get into girls' town?
I'm available.
I bet you this is what you had in mind. Huh, Animal?
Okay, Candy, put him down.
That Candy really has the power.
Dee Dee?
There's a moon out there and it's calling us.
I don't hear anything.
All right. The moon isn't calling but the waves are.
We can go sit by them until we get the message, while the children sleep.
Frankie, you go listen to the moon and the waves.
Until I hear wedding bells,
I’m children too.
You win some.
You lose quite a few.
- Oh, Bixby's Bird Farm!
- Oh, Cora, will you...
Oh, all right, all right.
Holy hot curl!
Girls, come here!
I wanna show you something. Hurry up.
Wake up, you guys.
Wake up, hurry up.
- I wanna show you something.
- What is it?
Throw your eyes at that!
The Sheik of Araby has pitched his pad among us!
Might be a mirage.
Let's go give it the double “O,” huh?
Hey, what's a double “O”?
Once over, Goo Goo.
Come on, you guys.
It's the Potato Bug!
He's here!
They've all gone beetle over a Potato Bug.
That ain't no mirage.
Dee Dee, I think we associate with a very unstable group.
Come on. It won't do any harm to have a look.
Don't tell me you've flipped over that crumpet eater.
Well, they say he's very nice, personally.
Personally, I can live without finding out.
Well, I can't.
I must insist you be as quiet as possible.
His eminence is sleeping.
His eminence?
- Are you his girl or something?
- No.
My name is Yvonne, but I am called Lady Bug.
I am the Potato Bug's bodyguard.
Oh, yeah.
- Who guards your body?
- I do.
What if some big handsome brute, and I'm not naming names, figured he'd make some time with you?
Why, you and I, we could make some beautiful music together.
Why, just come on into these arms, baby.
- Hey, that's something!
- It’s called Savate.
- Sa-who?
- Savate.
In French, that means the art of foot fighting.
You know something?
She can do with her feet what Candy can do with her...
- Giant ground swells!
- ...hips.
Wake surfing!
- This is it, huh, Dee Dee?
- Sure, it is, for now.
Our forever is right now.
- But what about tomorrow?
- Tomorrow is the day after today.
Frankie, there's a real tomorrow.
You gotta think about that.
Sure, I'll think about it.
Tomorrow.
You know something?
I got a feeling somebody's watching us.
I get the strangest feeling.
Something's wrong around here.
Yes, indeed.
You gotta have a rhythm when you dance
When you gamble, gotta take a chance
But when you wanna try a little romance
Then love's a secret weapon
Well, Clyde, they're doing your dance.
Take a little chance and look him in the eye
All you gotta do is give it a try
Yes, love's a secret weapon
So come on and take my advice
You'll find...
Clyde, Clyde, watch the paint.
Clyde, stop.
It’s time you started to believe
That's how Adam was won by Eve, oh!
That's the secret of the whole affair
Give a little love and tender care
If you're gonna get him and keep him there
Then love's a secret weapon
So come on, take my advice
Well, you'll find that love is kind of nice
It’s time you started to believe
That's how Adam was won by Eve, oh!
That's the secret of the whole affair
Give a little love and tender care
If you're gonna get him and keep him there
Then love's a secret weapon
Then love's a secret weapon
Yes, love's a secret weapon
Yeah!
Hey, there's a monkey!
Hey, hey! Look!
I thought the Potato Bug was taller.
Hey, I was right.
That monkey was watching us.
Clyde. Come along, Clyde.
Give them back their ball.
All right, Clyde.
All right, Clyde. Clyde!
- Hey, Tarzan! Where's Jane?
- Let's go check.
Clyde, come on.
Clyde, Clyde, Clyde.
Come along. Come along.
Come along, Clyde.
Clyde. Clyde, come here.
Clyde!
Now, may I ask whose board this happens to be?
- It’s mine.
- Oh, really.
- Well, may I use it?
- Be my guest.
- Clyde?
- Hey, hold it, now. No, no.
Son, just step back.
Watch, please.
I assure you.
Everything is all right.
Look at him.
- Oh, come on. What is this?
- No way. No way.
Well, he's paddling at least. Not bad.
You gotta be kidding!
- He made it!
- Hey, look at that!
- It’s fantastic!
- Great!
Hey, look at him!
Look at him turn! The bottom turn!
- Hey, Deadhead, he's better than you!
- Better looking, too!
Yeah!
- A headstand? That's it.
- No more. That's it.
Marvelous, yes.
- Did you enjoy Clyde's performance?
- Oh, yeah.
He's a real sharp chimp.
Well, I’m afraid you're missing the point.
You see, the point is not whether Clyde is sharp.
The point is that the intelligence of you young people has fallen to his level.
What's he talking about?
I’m determined to prove that you young people are borderline cases, leaning toward feeble-mindedness, with an abnormal preoccupation with sex.
- Well, yeah!
- That's all right.
The only display of knowledge being of a carnal nature.
Would you mind repeating that in English?
Quiet, Goo Goo.
You photograph quite well, Clyde.
Well, that's rather good, don't you think?
- That's not bad. It’s kind of cute.
- Yeah, it's cute.
- Well, who are you, anyway?
- Harvey Huntington Honeywagon.
- I'd keep that quiet if I were you.
- The Third.
Oh, you got the old folks' home down by the beach.
Sea-Esta by the Sea is a resort for senior citizens.
And your irresponsible behavior has... been a blemish on that fine community.
And I intend to do something about it.
- Hey, Frank, put him in his place!
- Wait a second! Wait a second! Look.
This is a public beach.
And just what do you think you're gonna do something about?
Well, you read tomorrow's paper, under this picture.
Those of you who can read, that is.
Hey, man, I went to school.
Come on, Clyde. Come on.
The nerve of that clown!
Yeah, he looks like something out of The Twilight Zone.
Imagine, comparing us to monkeys.
Deadhead, you might be the missing link.
Oh, I say there!
Over here.
- It’s the Potato Bug!
- It’s the Potato Bug!
Look at him! There's nobody in the whole world like him!
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
- I would.
Yes. That was a jolly good show.
Yes, jolly good indeed.
That simian creature, most amazing.
Positively remarkable!
Did you come here for surfing, Mr. Bug?
Oh, no. Crumbs, no.
Not enough speed, really.
Oh, yeah? Did you ever see a real hot dog... hit the big wild ones at 80 miles an hour?
I’m afraid I don't quite understand... your Yankee-type colloquialism, old chap.
A hot dog is a surfer, Potato Bug.
A hot dog's a surfer.
I thought you all spoke English here in the colonies.
- Oh, it's not required. It’s an elective.
- Oh.
I mean, 80 miles an hour really isn't very fast at all.
Oh, well, what would you call fast?
I don't know. Two hundred.
Two hundred and twenty.
That sort of thing.
Where it's a teensy-weensy bit frightening, with a spot of danger involved.
Yes. Well, I'd be delighted to show you chaps tomorrow if you'd like.
Just come over to the drag strip.
- Hey, you got a rail under there?
- Oh, quite.
Little hobby of mine, you know.
Jolly good fun. Yes.
But you 80-mile-an-hour chaps might find it a bit too devilish.
You might just find we can be pretty good.
Hey, let's get off this kick.
Maybe the Potato Bug will sing something for us.
Right-o. Just a few measures.
Ooh, I don't wanna be the richest man
Ooh, yeah, yeah!
All I wanna do is hold your hand
Ooh, yeah, yeah!
Riches won't buy you everything
I just want what love can bring
Ooh, give me your love!
I don't want what money can buy
Ooh, yeah, yeah!
Come on, little girl and I'll tell you why
Ooh, yeah, yeah!
Money won't buy you happiness
All I need is your sweet kiss
Ooh, give me your love
Now that you know what
I’m searching for
Ooh, yeah, yeah!
Say you'll be mine forevermore
Ooh, yeah, yeah!
You know I gotta find a love somehow
Say you're gonna make me happy now
Ooh, give me your love!
Ooh, give me your love!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
There now, that ought to be sufficient.
I'm really not one of my fans, you know.
I knew we had something in common.
Something in common?
Oh, yes! Quite humorous.
If you want to take it that way.
It's time for your midmorning tea, your eminence.
Oh, yes.
For the days when I was just plain old
Peter Royce Bentley of Sussex.
Oh, well. That's the price one must pay, you know.
Cheerio, cheerio.
Let's go, lassie.
To the office, Clyde.
Watch where you're going, Clyde!
Charlie, tell me I didn't see a monkey driving that Rolls.
I’m not gonna report that to headquarters.
They'll think I’m crazy.
I’m not gonna report it.
Captain will think I’m back on the sauce.
Let's take another look, huh?
It’s a monkey all right.
Sarge?
Sarge, you're not gonna believe this.
But Charlie and I are tailing a Rolls-Royce that's being driven by a monkey.
No, no, Sarge, by "monkey",
I don't mean some kind of punk.
I mean a real, live, furry...
Right, Sarge. Right.
Okay, Sarge. Right.
What'd he say?
Promised not to tell the captain if we'll go get some black coffee.
You know, that monkey drives better than my mother-in-law.
Come to think of it, he's better looking too.
Just because he pushes a rail, big deal.
Any grease monkey could learn that.
- Even you.
- Yeah, even me.
Great. Now you've really found a sure way to kill yourself, drag racing.
Speaking of drags, I have the feeling I’m with one right now.
Frankie, if you want to learn something, why don't you learn to get yourself a job now that school's out,
or learn to settle down?
Oh, you're suggesting a slow death.
No thanks. When I go,
I wanna go in a hurry.
Me, too. Goodbye.
- Oh, I say there. Having a spot of bother?
- Oh, it's nothing.
Oh, bit of a row with your frankfurter, eh?
What seems to be the problem, love?
He's got suicidal tendencies.
He wants to be a dragster.
Bit of a sticky wicket, what?
I mean, a chipper filly like you shouldn't be a poor widow.
Oh, I agree.
What would you say about being a rich one?
What do you mean?
Well, I wouldn't mind having you for my bird.
- Bird?
- Girl.
You're no different than he is.
Oh, fiddlesticks and rubbish.
I’m rich, you know.
- Money isn't everything.
- It is to a widow.
- Yeah.
- Come along, duck.
Let's have a spot of tea, eh?
- Well, why not?
- Yes.
"Why not?"
- Eighteen million!
- Yes.
Bit of a slow day.
Oh, well. Carry on. Come, love.
Great. A Potato Bug, a chimpanzee and now this.
My cup runneth over.
"Today's teenager true sub-culture."
"Youth of today leaves no hope for tomorrow."
"Yesterday, in broad daylight, in a place illegally called Bikini Beach,"
"we were witness to scenes of wild perversion"
"and abandonment that defy description.
"The solution is for the county to condemn the surfing area."
"By making this facility unavailable to these potential delinquents,"
"we could persuade them into more useful endeavors"
"than studying each other's anatomy."
"It might be fitting to warn responsible parents"
"who grew straight and tall by building our character on the three R's,
"that our children have progressed to the three S's,
"surfing, speed and sex, not necessarily in that order."
I do turn rather a handsome phrase.
I’m sorry, sir. I tried to stop her but she...
How dare you break into my office!
Don't you "how dare" me.
How dare you print this vicious article against these vacationing kids.
It’s untrue and I demand to speak to your publisher.
Madam, I am the publisher.
Please identify yourself and explain this outburst.
You may go now, Miss Simms, and please go gently.
This editorial has no basis in fact.
Now, who are you?
And why do you get so wrought up over these juvenile delinquents?
- They're not juvenile delinquents.
- I resent that.
And I resent these lies.
Look, I’m a schoolteacher and I know these kids.
Those surfers are building strong, healthy bodies, and together with the boys who build the dragsters, they'll be responsible for tomorrow's rockets to the moon.
Well, now, that doesn't auger too well for the future, does it?
Well, what's wrong with physical fitness?
You should try it sometime.
I do not deplore physical fitness, but I do deplore half-naked young ladies, if they may be called that, running around in these scanty bikinis.
Imagine, boys and girls sleeping on the beach, side by side, unchaperoned.
Now, what kind of a society is it that would allow such a thing?
And what kind of a mind is it that's always ready to believe there's something wrong?
You need an education, madam.
Well, it's miss. Miss Clements.
Are you willing to devote an afternoon to seeing the truth?
Is that a challenge?
In that case, it would be a pleasure.
Very well. I shall take you to a teenage haunt known as
Big Drag's Pit Stop.
Ball.
Quiet, or you'll wind up on the menu.
Ball three.
Ball too high.
One more crack out of you and you'll be today's special.
I just call them as
I see them. You bum.
What a mess.
Answer the door.
Answer the door.
I’m closed.
I’m Harvey Huntington
Honeywagon III.
In that case, I’m open.
- What do you think this is, a zoo?
- One would assume so.
- That's Frieda, my bird.
- Oh, and this is Clyde.
- How do you do?
- And Miss Clements.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- Oh, rather unkempt, I should say.
- I've been cleaning up.
I always clean up in the daytime because I always clean up at night.
Oh, then I assume you are the person known as Big Drag?
Yeah. That's me, Big Drag.
Pleased to meet you.
Oh. Oh, excuse me.
I also dabble in the arts.
Well, Mr. Drag, we're on a mission.
A crusade, you might say.
Well, I don't think there's enough room in here for a crusade.
Did you read the paper this morning?
Particularly an article about the youth of today?
Sure, first thing.
Right after the comics.
Won't you sit down?
We're closed, but
I guess we're open.
So, why don't somebody buy something?
Well, I’ll have a martini.
We don't serve booze in Big Drag's.
Notice there are no cigarette machines around either.
This is strictly for kids.
Beer and soft drinks.
I’m with you, Big Drag.
Make mine a beer.
And I shall have a soft drink.
Straight or over the rocks?
One beer.
Mr. Drag, I understand you're quite an authority on the youth of today.
You mean kids?
I see them all day at the drag strip and all night here.
Well, then you shall be able to help me.
That article you saw in the paper this morning was one of a series I’m doing on the depravities of the youth of today.
What depravities?
Did you ever see the kids at the drag strip?
Certainly not.
- Did you ever see the kids that come here?
- Of course not.
Then the authority I am, you ain't.
My dear sir, I am not accustomed to being treated so cavalierly.
Nor was my father,
H.H. Honeywagon II, nor his sainted father,
H.H. Honeywagon I
You sure come from a long line of Honeywagons.
In other words, you have nothing to say to me.
Not in front of everyone.
Oh, Clyde.
Yes, I do have one thing to say. don't like the way your Clyde is looking at my bird.
Well, I don't like the way your bird is looking at my Clyde.
Stop playing with my bird.
Now, come along. Come along.
Come along, Clyde. Come along.
- Stop it!
- Good day, sir!
Clyde.
I should stay closed.
It’s better for business.
Hey! My paintings are not for sale, sir.
There's part of me on those canvasses.
It hurts me to see anybody look at them like they might buy them.
I’ll get it.
Who was that?
He's a famous art dealer.
He's been after my stuff for a long time.
But I won't sell.
Big Drag is for the ages.
Someday when I’m gone, some proud collector will say,
"Look at this! It’s a real Drag."
My place!
- Done it again, boss.
- You stupid. Fix it.
Hey, you. Stupid. Fix it.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What do you want?
What's going on here?
What is that... What is that all about?
What's going on?
You'll kill somebody!
Will you guys watch it?
You're gonna hurt somebody.
Hey! Eric Von Zipper likes you!
And when Eric Von Zipper likes somebody, they stay liked.
Hey, I think I heard about you, the creature from the black lagoon.
- You, I don't like.
- Yeah. You, he don't like.
- And who are you?
- J.D.
Yeah. That's short for juvenile delinquent.
Later you will get the Rats' revenge.
Right now, I wanna talk to you.
You are my idol.
I seen your picture in the paper and I read your article.
J.D., he read me your article.
But I loved it.
Look who's on your side.
I seen your picture, too.
Clyde, quiet!
You know, what you said about them surfers is right.
They are bums.
And we are gonna stamp them out together
'cause the surfers is the natural enemies of the Rats and Mice.
- Right?
- Right.
- Surfers is giving us a bad name. Right?
- Right.
You and me, we're a team, and we're gonna destroy them.
Together, with violence!
Well, I had in mind something of a more legal nature.
You see? Everybody likes you.
You got friends, and we're gonna stick by you.
What is that bit about water seeking its own level?
Birds of a feather and all that.
Sir, I consider you a member of the lower classes.
You're right.
How'd you know that?
You know, I went all the way through the third grade.
You are my idol.
And you know something?
The Rats and Mice are behind you.
And now, Eric Von Zipper is hungry.
- What would you like?
- I don't know.
Like, maybe a bird sandwich.
No! I’ll get you salami. it’ll be 70 cents.
Hey, I don't think you understand me.
Eric Von Zipper don't buy.
He takes.
That's not nice.
I think I’m closed.
You are push me too far.
Now you get the Rats' revenge.
- No, but wait. But, but, but.
- No buts!
- You gonna hit him, boss?
- Yeah, I’m gonna hit him.
But, but, but!
No, no! Help!
Are you...
Hold his mouth, too.
Now, you hold his bird.
Well?
He's got a very nasty bird, boss.
- Well, then, just forget it.
- That's some pal you have.
Just hold him now.
Just hold him.
- What, what, what?
- Unhand this man, sir!
Tell your Rats I don't want this gentleman molested.
Release him this instant.
You may be my idol, but nobody, nobody tells Eric Von Zipper nothing.
You see, as long as the Finger ain't here,
Eric Von Zipper is the king.
Who is the Finger?
- There was a fellow here last year.
- Professor-type fellow.
- And he made with the finger.
- Called it a technique.
- Yeah. Something like the Hima...
- Layan.
Layan. Himalayan suspenders technique.
Very potent type of
Zen karate thing.
Yeah, what he used to do, he used to take his finger, see?
- And he would put it by my head...
- Watch it, boss.
Don't worry.
I ain't gonna do it.
See, he would take his finger, but you had to have a special kind of brain for this. See? And I have one.
He would take his finger and he would put it alongside my brain, and then he would push it and...
The boss did it again.
He gave himself the finger.
- I think he stripped his clutch again.
- Hey, boss.
Get this stiff out of here.
When Big Drag speaks, he commands.
Away, away!
Frieda, are you all right?
Gently, gently. Don't break him.
And stay out!
Von Zipper will return with an army!
- I think I'm gonna like you, Harvey.
- Why?
With him for a friend, you don't need me for an enemy.
They call that drag racing?
I don't see them dragging nothing.
Man, you sure you wanna go for this bit?
Yeah, Johnny. I’m gonna go for this bit.
I’m gonna go all the way.
The winner, Dave Wilkins in his scalloper.
Time, 8. 10 seconds at 188.66 miles per hour.
It’s the Potato Bug! Hi!
He acts like he owns the whole world.
Hey, there! What time do you leave for the moon, Bug?
Oh, jolly good.
Your frankfurter has come to see me perform.
He's a chipper sport, he is.
Must be a bit of English blood there, I say.
I have the feeling he's here to check on my performance.
I wonder what she sees in that fugitive from a barbershop.
Those rails are all smoke and noise, man.
Hi there..
It’s a great honor to have you here, Mr. Bug.
Sorry I couldn't meet you, but
I thought I'd clean up a bit.
I own this place.
I’m Big Drag.
Well, it's a pleasure to know you, Mr. Drag.
- Absolutely top hole.
- Yeah.
Well, you can call me Big, Potato.
- And you can call him Mr. Bug.
- Oh.
The reason I’m here, old chap, is that I want to try out my new rail and have a shot at your world record, you know.
What is that?
It’s England's revenge for the Boston Tea Party.
Well, are you about set, Potato?
I mean, Mr. Bug.
I’d be crackers if
I weren't, old boy.
Be at the ready at all times, you see.
Carry on regardless and all that sort of rot.
He sure looks good in that silver suit, though.
Yeah. I wonder how he'd look in that ambulance?
Then, we're off and sailing, eh?
Yeah. I’ll go shine up a trophy.
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please.
As a surprise attraction,
Peter Royce Bentley,
better known as the Potato Bug, will attempt to break his world record for the quarter-mile drag.
It’s a bird.
It’s a hunk of iron.
Anybody could handle that.
Friends, gang! Listen to this!
The time, 7.9 seconds,
202.3 miles per hour!
A new world record!
Here's your trophy, Mr. Bug.
See where I signed it? Big Drag.
Oh, jolly decent of you, Big.
- Here, ducks. It’s all for you, love.
- But I didn't do anything.
You might have to.
That's a loving cup, you know.
Well, that sounds like a good idea.
Only it should come from him.
Good, oh. Good, oh.
Congratulations, and I’d like to challenge you.
You josh.
I wouldn't if I were you.
I’d simply carry on with those surfing sticks you frankfurters are so fond of.
I mean it.
When I’m ready, I want to race you.
Good show. I like that sort of spirit.
Simply toss me the gauntlet when you're ready and we'll have a go at it.
You see?
Will everyone please clear the track?
We have a new contestant, a mystery driver.
Oh, well, it's off to tidy up a bit.
Later, ducks, eh?
Ladies and gentlemen, the Potato Bug's record has just been broken!
The mystery driver set a new record!
Time, 7.1 seconds at
203 miles per hour!
Now, Miss Clements, one moment please.
Excuse me.
I have something I wish to show you.
I’m not so sure
I want to see it.
You are the new champ, sir.
I got that feeling again.
There's a monkey suit with a real monkey in it.
Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it.
There you are.
It’s like Frankie said, anybody can learn to drive one.
What were you trying to do?
Make monkeys out of us?
You think we ain't got honor?
You think we ain't got dignity?
Well, no offense, sir.
I’m just trying to prove a theory of mine.
This is an insult.
Would you like to have your picture taken, sir?
For the front page of the newspaper?
- For the paper?
- Yes.
- A picture of me?
- Yes.
- With him?
- Yeah.
- I’ll buy that.
- Oh, that's fine.
Now, just you put your arm around him.
Very friendly. Oh, boy, that's right.
Oh, that's wonderful.
There we are.
Well, my dear.
What do you think now?
So you taught a monkey to drive.
But he didn't build the machine.
He didn't create anything.
But I did.
I created the impression that teenagers live in a simian world.
And I believe I created some doubt in your mind. Isn't that right?
Only of your sanity.
Excuse me, but I’d like to talk to someone about getting myself a rail.
That's me. Big Drag.
You better ask him about learning how to drive one of those things, too.
- Yeah. He wants to be a drag, like you.
- You've come to the right place.
- How much money do you have?
- 100 bucks.
100 bucks?
I can let you have this for 100 bucks.
- Well, maybe we could fix it up.
- Oh, I don't know.
Well, I gotta be fair about this.
Something I should tell you before you buy it.
The brakes pull bad to the left.
The steering wheel's loose and the clutch slips.
And you need two new rear tires.
And you shouldn't pull out the choke.
- Why not?
- Because it releases the parachute.
Now, look.
Doesn't anything work on this car?
The radio's kind of nice.
Maybe somebody could loan me a rail or I could rent one.
Hey, you look like a fellow I used to know.
- His name was Jack something.
- Yeah. I used to be Jack Fanny. had a string of musclemen whose muscle was mainly in their heads.
But I got out of the fanny business.
That's all behind me now.
I can show you a model over here you might like.
This is a rail.
It’s not a rail like you think a rail should be.
It’s a rail because it's the principle of motorocity.
Now, let me give you a few of the basic principles of motorocity.
Which is the wheel?
The wheel is round, as you see.
The reason the wheel is round, is that round wheels are round, and the rounder the wheel, the better.
They're the best kind, you know.
Since a long time ago, we discovered that square wheels didn't work well.
So you see, squares are squares and wheels are wheelers.
Now, when we think wheel, we think round.
- Have I made myself clear?
- Yeah.
Well, how come they call that thing a rail?
You don't understand
English, do you?
All that greasy kids' stuff has softened his brain.
- Would you like a demonstration?
- Yeah.
Come on.
Roll it out.
Roll it out.
It’s the wrangler stretch!
Oh, I say, this is a jolly good show.
The entire establishment is leaping!
- Is that how one puts it, my dear?
- You're close.
The translation is,
"The joint is jumping."
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
Good show. Good show.
- Clyde likes it.
- I’m happy for him.
And now I take great pride in proudly presenting The Pyramids.
Looks like a bug, laughs like a hyena.
Well, they all stand up as he idles by
Gonna cheer him on for the record try
Best rails here from every state now
Everyone knows the competition's great now
Record run, record run
Pardon me, lady.
Miss Bug?
Would you care to hit the boards with little old Deadhead?
Merci, Monsieur Head.
It seems to be one of your native dances.
You will have to teach me.
Yeah, yeah. I’d just love to go native with you.
Record run, record run, record run
Enjoy. Enjoy, love.
Hurry back.
The music of the youth of today is straight out of the jungle.
The tree is green there isn't any doubt
We're gonna see...
The savage music that stimulates their post-adolescent preoccupation with sex.
You sure love that three letter word.
Record run, record run
These children are nothing more than animals.
Come off it, Harvey.
They're having fun.
"Fun", now, that's a three-letter word
I bet you never heard of.
- Come on, let's join them.
- I’m here strictly as an observer.
I have a feeling you've always been an observer.
Let's not be vulgar.
I think I’m gonna ask Clyde to dance.
At least he's enjoying himself.
Well, of course he is.
Everything here is down to his level.
If he's having such a good time, maybe we should give him a real treat.
I bet he'd go ape at the Coconut Grove.
Hey!
Well, you got no worries now.
Eric Von Zipper is right with you to protect you in case them beach bums give you any trouble.
I don't know how you got so lucky, Harvey.
Yeah. Oh, by the way,
I want to apologize.
I’m sorry I was not out at the drag strip to protect you today, but I just woke up from that Himalayan suspenders trance.
- Really? How can you tell?
- Oh, it's easy.
See, every time
I give myself the finger... Oh!
I better not, 'cause I gotta keep my mentality on the alert to protect you,
'cause you are my idol.
What? Oh! Hello, Clyde.
Nice to see you again.
You know something, Clyde?
I could get to like you
'cause you're my kind of people.
You shouldn't have said that.
He's very sensitive.
Oh. Oh, I... I'm sorry, Clyde.
Well, nothing to worry about.
I’ll be right over there with my rat pack in case you need any help.
You are my idol.
Beach bunnies, surfers and dragsters, it gives me great pleasure to give you great pleasure.
Big Drag is proud to say that right here in the middle of our midst is a famous, well-known celebrity.
I guess you all know who I’m talking about.
We want Potato Bug!
We want Potato Bug!
We want Potato Bug!
We want Potato Bug!
By George, this is jolly good of you.
Makes me feel super, don't you know!
This is an unexpected pleasure we didn't expect, Mr. Bug.
I’ll put it in my memory book if I don't forget.
Thank you, old sport!
- Ooh!
- How about that?
- Ooh!
- How about that?
- Hey, you've got lips
- How about that?
And those lips they need kissing
Hey, little girl, how about kissing me? Ooh!
- You got love.
- How about that?
And your love I’ve been missing
Hey, little girl, how about loving me?
- How about that?
- Ooh!
I’ve been waiting a long, long time
For a little girl like you
Now at last you're gonna be mine
Tell you what I’m gonna do, ooh
- I love you
- How about that?
All my love I’ll be giving
Hey, little girl, how about loving me, too?
- How about that?
- Ooh.
Ooh
How about that?
I’ve been waiting a long, long time
For a little girl like you
Now at last you're gonna be mine
Tell you what I’m gonna do
Tell you what I’m gonna do
All my love I’ll be giving
Hey, little girl, you're the girl for me
How about that?
Hey, little girl, you're the girl for me
- How about that?
- Ooh!
Hey, little girl, you're the girl for me
How about that?
- How about that?
- Ooh
Good girl. Good girl.
Yes. Quite spunky.
He's got a head like Gibraltar.
Yes, quite stylish, too. Yes.
So don't worry, Frankie
A guy like you, you get another chick like that.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Not at this table.
Look, Johnny, I don't want another chick.
- I don't want anything.
- Hey, I’m with you.
That way you don't have to take a chick to dances.
You don't have to find a place to smooch.
And you don't have to think about what we're always thinking about.
Hey. What am I saying?
Would you two like to be alone?
Look, here comes creep.
Frieda, keep a civil tongue in your beak.
How many times do I have to tell you, sir?
My art has no price on it.
I mean, it's priceless.
- Ain't this spiffy?
- Yeah.
I think I’ll lower the bridge on London town.
Hold it. What he's doing, you can do better.
- Yeah.
- But if I’m wrong, don't blame me.
Thanks a lot.
- Dee Dee, I want to talk to you.
- Go ahead and talk.
I mean alone.
Sorry, old chap. But I’d like to take Dee Dee home.
Oh, I think it would be a spiffing idea if you two were to reconcile.
Though I must admit I’ve become quite attached to your young lady.
Double drats, I believe the word is "poultry."
You mean, "chick."
Are you sure it's all right, Potato?
Oh, first names.
Oh, it's top hole.
Only sporting thing to do.
Give the young man a chance to display his charms.
Test them against mine, that sort of thing.
Yeah, yeah, come on, Dee Dee.
Let's get out of here..
He's a rude bugger, he is.
It’s Watusi time!
Now, Clyde.
I got you where I want you
I want you where I got you
You're never gonna get away from me
I want you where I got you
I got you where I want you
There's no one else around but you and me
We got plenty of time
They won't be home until nine
I got you all to myself until then
Clyde's people invented the Watusi.
Sure, they were the original swingers.
I got you where I want you
I want you where I got you
You're never gonna get away from me
I want you where I got you
I got you where I want you
There's no one else around but you and me
Now, wait. Hold it.
Stop the music! Stop everything!
Now, wait a second. Wait a second.
This has got to stop.
What kind of a place do you think I’m running?
Well, I’d rather not answer that, Mr. Drag.
Would you like to have your picture taken for the newspaper?
- Again?
- Yeah.
- Oh, I suppose you need the circulation.
- Yeah.
- Would you like to...
- No, no. We won't need you.
There we are. Here you are, Clyde.
That's right. Thank you, sir.
Come along, Clyde.
Oh, excellent, Clyde. Excellent.
Time we went along, my dear.
Tomorrow morning's editorial is going to be an eye-opener for the entire community.
I’m waiting for your eyes to open.
He's a sweetheart of a guy.
It’s beautiful, isn't it?
You know, this is the first time the day's been quiet enough to hear the waves.
I’m sorry I took you away from your date.
I didn't mean to.
You didn't?
All right, I did. But I don't blame you for liking the Bug.
- For one thing, he's famous.
- Yes.
- And he's rich.
- Yes.
And all the girls go ape when they see him.
- Then why are you walking here with me?
- Because you're you.
Every time you hold me
I know it's real
My heart once told me
How it would feel
Why?
Just like you told me
Why?
Each time you hold me
Why?
Because you're you
Every time I’m near you
Stars from the skies
Somehow appear to
Shine in your eyes
Why?
They just appear to
Why?
Each time I’m near you
Why?
Because you're you
Every time we kiss now
It’s plain to see
So sure of this now
You were meant for me
Why?
So sure of this now
Why?
Each time we kiss now
Why?
Because you're you
Because you're you
Because you're you
Well, I’m glad everything's settled.
Things are back to normal, and we can just forget about drag racing.
Hold it. Who said anything about forgetting it?
I can't back out of that race.
A man's got to stand by his word.
I told him I’d race him, and that's the way it's gotta be.
Well, then he'll back out of it because I’ll tell him to.
You stay out of this.
Anything you say, Frankie.
And so I say, the best way to go forward is to borrow from the past.
Return to that steady, reliable course charted for us by our forebears.
If it was good enough for our fathers, and good enough for our grandfathers, then it follows that it must be good enough...
I’m sorry, Mr. Honeywagon.
I told her you were tied up.
Tied up is too good for him.
He should be locked up.
She never listens, Miss Simms, but thanks for trying.
I just finished today's article.
Would you like to read it?
I didn't even read yesterday's.
I put it on the bottom of my canary's cage.
- I resent that.
- He hated it.
Harvey Honeywagon,
I’ve been doing some digging.
And I found out why you're putting the knock on these kids.
For purely moral reasons is why.
For purely commercial reasons is why.
You're trying to buy up that beach property so you can expand your OFH.
- And what is "OFH"?
- Old folks' home.
It is not an old folks' home!
It is Sea-Esta by the Sea!
You mean, "Fee-esta."
The fee is the only thing you're interested in.
I am interested in protecting my residents from an evil environment.
Sea-Esta by the Sea is a resort for senior citizens, and I’m going to see to it that they get the peace and quiet they so richly deserve.
Well, they're getting it, all right
It’s more of a last resort for them.
All they do is sit and vegetate.
Honeywagon's vegetable farm, that's what you're running.
Now, that's really an insult.
All I’m trying to do is help these poor people who have been forced into retirement.
You're helping them into their graves.
Why don't you furnish shovels?
I’m only doing what I think is proper and right.
Harvey Honeywagon, you listen to me.
You're holding a double-barrel shotgun.
Killing off the old folks while you kill off the fun for the youngsters.
I guess it never occurred to you that the... beach is a place to live, not to die.
- Have you quite finished be...
- I’ve finished!
And don't ask me to leave.
I’d rather it was my idea.
You know, for a while there,
I was beginning to like you.
Now I wish you'd take a room at the vegetable farm and retire.
I’ll get the kids to take up a collection.
We'll send you a shovel.
Well, I’m just going to have to appeal to the Potato Bug's sportsmanship.
I bet he won't be as stubborn as Frankie.
Well, what's wrong with drag racing?
I think it's kind of groovy.
Aren't surfboards fast enough for you, Animal?
No, and neither are the surfers.
Would you trade that beautiful ocean for a dirty old rail?
Well, there's room for both.
Not in my life.
Wish me luck.
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.
A little short in the back.
- How do I look from the front?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're the buggiest little Bug
I ever saw, from the front.
- But don't let her get behind you.
- Okay.
There she is.
Well, wish me luck.
- Good luck, Potato.
- Yeah.
Hi, Potato.
Oh, I say, this is a spot of luck, by George, don't you know.
Out for my evening stroll, that sort of thing, and here you are.
A bit of luck, indeed.
Ripping, actually.
I was just on my way to see you.
Oh, by George, and rather!
A girl and her frankfurter soon parted, so to speak.
And one is quite flattered, don't you know.
Potato, do you feel all right?
Oh, all right? Oh, yes, yes.
A touch... Touch of sinus, you know.
You know, the sea.
And a stiff neck as well, yeah.
Well, I was really coming over to ask you for a favor.
Now, what is it, love?
Potato, I want you to cancel the race with Frankie.
Good heavens, girl, you josh!
You can't ask that!
No. No. You can't ask an Englishman to bend his word.
And there's a bit more to it than that, you know.
I wouldn't mind having you for my bird.
Well, you don't have to win the race to win everything.
Oh, yes. Yes.
There are other things.
Indeed, there are.
And, ducks, you're making me feel, shall I say, frivolous.
You know, fogging up the old glasses.
- Potato, then you will cancel the race?
- Definitely not!
A challenge is a challenge!
But here we are all alone, and...
Can't you just forget about everything else?
Well, one is tempted, my dear.
Especially when one is aware of our proximity.
- It’s you I love.
- Yeah.
Are you really aware of that?
Well, Englishmen are not made of wood, my dear.
We are well aware of the opposite sex, have been for centuries.
I’d just die if anything happened to you
Yeah.
Well, you know, you can always go back to your Frankie chap.
It can't be all that bad.
He's really quite a good catch.
And he sings better than I do, actually, don't you know.
You're just being gallant.
There's only one Potato Bug.
Oh, well, I don't know that.
My word, ducks! You seem to be wrong.
There appears to be two Potato Bugs.
By Jove, I don't believe I’ve ever known a wicket this sticky!
I think I know which wicket is the stickiest around here.
Now, love. Now, ducks.
You see, only our hairdressers know for sure.
To think that you could stoop to such a low-down trick!
I never want to see you again!
I should say not, after those things you said to me.
I mean, to him.
Did you mean all that love junk?
- Wouldn't you like to know.
- Yes.
I say there, you two.
Stow it, won't you?
I have no idea what this is all about.
But one must cope.
Be civilized. Stiff upper lip and all of that, you know.
You keep out of this, you beetle-eyed bug.
You're just as bad as he is.
Both of you are always trying to find new ways to kill yourselves.
Well, I hope you both make it.
- Where did we go wrong?
- Where did we go wrong?
Hey, so let's play already, huh, daddy?
Eric Von Zipper plays when Eric Von Zipper is ready.
You stupid...
Would you mind?
Would you mind?
Boss. Hey, boss, read this.
- You stupid?
- Oh, I’m sorry, boss. I forgot.
I’ll read it to you.
It’s by that fella, Honeycart.
Honeycart, he is my idol.
I adore him.
You wait till you hear this.
It says, "This is a retro-action."
- What does that mean, boss?
- Oh, that's when it's...
- Keep reading, stupid.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
"This is a retro-action of everything I have said,"
"and an ape-ology from the farther-est reaches of my heart."
That's my friend.
He sure writes beautiful.
"I... I consider my actions almost mani-acle"
"and want to tell the public that all the young surfers"
"make our beaches ring with joy and laughter."
That's the worst stuff that was ever read to me!
What a fink!
And I thought he was a good guy!
Hey, daddy, are you gonna play this pool game or ain't you?
Yeah, I’m gonna play pool.
Dirty pool.
Out! Out!
Now my friend gets the Rats' revenge!
- Oh, I’m sorry, boss.
- You stupid.
How are you fixed for blood?
You want to play a game before the moon comes out?
All right. Just take it easy.
Cool it, daddy. I’ll play by myself.
"And the presence of these young people is a fond reminder to the older generation"
"that they were young once and perhaps still are."
Eric Von Zipper has been betrayed!
The good guys of this world has been betrayed!
And all because of one fink, you!
I must ask you and your curious conglomeration to leave my office.
- What's he trying to say, boss?
- It don't make no difference.
We leave when Eric Von Zipper says we leave.
You used to be my idol, but you turned into a regular Arnold Benedict.
And all because of a woman.
A woman's work is never done, but this one done it.
Then teachers is the worst kind.
You know what this is?
This is a regular Delilah and Simpson bit.
I must ask you to leave these premises before you arouse my ire.
- What's that mean, boss?
- It means keep out of my office!
That does it! Now you will get the Rats' revenge!
That'll be a pleasure.
You can let him go now
'cause Von Zipper does not like violence in front of broads.
But Von Zipper will get his revenge
'cause Von Zipper always uses his head.
He done it again.
He gave himself the finger.
Come on, let's get him out of here.
Eric Von Zipper will get his Rats' revenge!
Harvey, I never realized.
Well, deep down inside, all we Honeywagons are full of...
Well, much more than one would suspect.
Well, fellas, what do you think?
Are you kidding? It’s the greatest!
Come on. Look, I know it's not much, but we can make it something.
Well, when do we start?
- Yeah.
- When?
Well, it isn't gonna be easy, but we can do it.
We can make this rail faster than anything on the strip.
But it's gonna cost us every dime in our pockets.
So, what's money?
What we can't buy, we'll scrounge.
We'll turn this into something so fast you can't even see the smoke.
The only one who'll see the smoke is the Potato Bug.
- Smoked Potato Bug, you get it?
- Yeah. Well, let's start.
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it!
I guess you guys didn't get the message when I told you about motorocity.
One of the most principled principles of motorocity is generosity.
That's why I, Big Drag, am going to loan this rail to him.
- Hey!
- Thanks a lot! Thanks, Big!
Gee, that's big of you, Big.
Another principle of motorocity is that more people want to come to a grudge race than any other kind.
But I wouldn't want to mention that because some people might think we're trying to commercialize in a sport that deals strictly for funds.
- I mean, fun.
- You're a good guy, Big.
Look at it, Dee Dee.
Right now it's just wheels and rails.
When that flag drops, it becomes 1,000 horses.
And that's a lot of power.
It’s an 80-foot wave and you ride close to the crest.
No. No, there's a difference.
The ocean, its wild and it's free.
It’s something you can't change.
But this, this is an engine, a machine.
It can be controlled.
It scares me when I think about it.
It’s like you want to take every chance there is.
Dee Dee, that's the way we've got to live.
That's what it's about.
You ride your 1,000 horses, Frankie.
I’ll be betting on every one of them.
Would you like to give it a trial run, Frankie?
- You bet.
- Come on, fellas.
Come on, boys. Move it out.
This time it's love
I can see it in his eyes
This time it's love
Though it should be no surprise
I’m like a little child
All starry-eyed and wild
This time it's love
This time it's real
I have found the boy for me
The way I feel
I know it was meant to be
I’ve always known somehow
The way it would be now
This time it's love
How wonderful to know that your dreams come true
How wonderful to know someone cares for you
Oh, this time it's love
And I know each time we kiss
This time it's love
Suddenly I’m sure of this
I have that certain glow
That only lovers know
This time it's love
I have that certain glow
That only lovers know
This time it's love
You stupids!
Now, here's how we get the Rats' revenge.
Tomorrow is the grudge race, right?
Right!
Whisper! Whisper! You stupids!
Now, we put the fix on the Potato Bug's rail.
Now comes the race.
The Bug's rail goes powie.
And the Bug, he gets hit with the flit. Right?
Right.
Now, everybody thinks that Frankie done it account of it's a grudge race, see?
So everybody will see that the Von Zipper is right and that the beach bums is bums. Right?
Right.
Any questions?
- Yeah.
- What? What?
How do we put the fix on the Potato Bug's rail?
Listen to the Von Zipper and you will learn things.
First, we amputate the eliminator.
Then, we eliminate the amputator.
And from then on, it's simple.
Let's go.
Sorry, boss.
Thanks, boss.
Which one is it, boss?
That one.
Hey, it's kind of groovy, boss.
- Cycles is better.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, boss.
By the tire. By the tire!
Get a screwdriver.
I’ll loosen this nut.
Becca, what in the world is a drag strip?
I haven't the faintest, but I’ll bet it's... gonna be more fun than the mausoleum.
Oh, I’ll bet.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to blast off with the preliminary race.
You're right, Becca.
This is more fun than the mausoleum.
You just listen to me,
Florabella!
The winner is Fordney Allen in his Mighty Malibu!
Time, 8.2 seconds at 198.3 miles per hour.
Clyde!
Clyde!
You've got them living again and loving it.
Oh, I’m quite big with the older types.
You're quite big with me, too.
Everybody go over to Big Drag's Pit Stop and wait for me there.
Where we will have the victory celebration to prove that Eric Von Zipper done it again.
- Ain't you gonna go with us, boss?
- No, I’m gonna stay here for the kill.
Out! Out! Out!
Hey, wait!
Your attention, please.
The next event is the one we've all been waiting for.
The match between England's champion, the famous Potato Bug, and Frankie, our own local surfer.
Potato!
Good luck, and I mean it.
Oh, yes, and may the better man emerge victorious, old chap, don't you see.
Don't worry, Dee Dee.
It will all be over in a few seconds.
I wish you wouldn't put it that way.
You two all right?
That was my best rail.
I’ve been sabotaged.
I told them to fix the Potato
Bug's car. Those stupids.
Von Zipper.
It was, like, a mistake.
You know what I mean?
- Von Zipper did it.
- I did?
It wasn't me. There was a...
There was a group, see?
I told them to fix the Potato
Bug's car. Those stupids.
Don't go away. I’ll be right back, see, 'cause I know the kids who did it.
So, you stay there, and I’ll be right back.
How do you start it?
How do you start it?
How do you stop it?
Somebody, stop it!
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
You're in the way!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Look out! Look out!
Look out! You're in the way!
Everybody back into the bus!
Follow those cars!
Look out!
Hey, look out! Move over!
Move! Move! You're in the way!
Look out!
Howdy.
Howdy?
- Deadhead, watch out!
- Watch out for what?
Can you believe this?
- Shall we get some black coffee?
- No, I’m going back on the sauce.
Oh, that's stupid!
Well, you made it, boss.
Sort of.
I knew I shouldn't have had that door fixed.
You! You sabotager, you!
You rail derailer!
They told me there'd be days like this.
Now, stop that!
Don't, Harvey!
There he is!
There's the fink that ain't our idol no more!
Our side needs all the help we can get, my dear.
Clyde! Clyde!
Pyramids, play something!
Play something!
- What?
- You've done it again, boss.
Candy!
Come on. Give them your bit.
There!
My place, they're ruining it.
Oh, they really are ruining me!
Oh, jolly good! Yes!
Oh, hi there, ducks.
Sorry I’m late, but I had to stop for some petrol, don't you know.
Oh, my word, ducks. ln England, one would call this a spot of the old nasty, yes.
But in France, we would call it an election.
Oh, bit of a near thing, that.
Oh, good show! Liked that!
- Oh, I say, ducks. Isn’t he one of ours?
- Oui.
Yes. Excuse me, old boy.
Not very sporting, lad.
I don't want you to see what's gonna happen to you.
Thank you. It’s called karate, old boy.
Oh, he's all yours, ducks.
Hey, your shoelace is untied.
Now, stop it!
Thank you, my dear.
Now, please repair to a safer place.
Are you all right?
Which do you prefer, love?
- Him.
- Good-o.
Good show! Good show!
Enjoy! Enjoy!
- Excuse me, old boy.
- What? What? What?
Why you rotten little bug!
I’m gonna squash you!
What's all that?
Most peculiar, that. Yes.
Hold her still!
Hold her still!
You stupid...
- Parcheez!
- What is that, "parcheez"?
That's what it is, "parcheez."
I want to say...
Now cut that out, Clyde, or I’ll rent you a room at the zoo.
If I didn't own this joint, I’d sue me.
You stupid...
No! I’m too young to die!
Now, put that back.
That's part of my wall.
- That's part of his wall.
- That's part of his wall.
First my wall, now my art.
How many times do I have to tell you?
My work is not for sale.
One of them is a masterpiece.
I’ll take it.
It is? You will?
That's the one!
But, but, but, but.
Have it sent to my place and there'll be a check for $1,000 waiting.
I must tell Vincent Price about this place.
Oh, what monsters.
- Come on, Miss Florabella!
- All right.
- Oh, come on! We've got to go.
- All right
Well, come on!
Hi, Clyde.
Hey, you guys, the battle's over!
Von Zipper's stoned again!
All right, you Rats, get him out of here!
Get that creep out of here!
Come on, boss. Wake up! Wake up!
- He's back in those Himalayan suspenders.
- Yup, he's done it again.
Let's get him out of here.
The great Von Zipper will return!
Well! Can you believe that?
I tell you, Becca, this is the most fun
I’ve had since Berry's Nut Farm.
Well, how'd you make out, Potato?
Oh, it was a wonderful sport.
Splendid really.
I must tell them about this upon my return in London town, eh, ducks?
We're gonna miss you, Bug.
What are your plans?
Oh, jolly good, I should say.
Lady Bug and I have come to an agreement.
Wedding bells and all that sort of rot, don't you know.
Hey, congratulations!
I hope you two don't fight as much as Dee Dee and I.
Oh, I should hope not.
I abhor fisticuffs.
Or, in your case, my dear, "footsicuffs."
I made a deal with him.
He does not raise his voice to me,
I do not raise my feet to him.
Welcome to Big Drag's Pit Stop.
Come on in, folks.
Come on in and join the kids.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Clydes and birds, and all you kids, it gives me great pleasure to present to you Little Stevie Wonder.
- Dance and shout, work it on out

Hey guys.
Hey tell me please,
Is there any wedding here?
Are you those musicians who will play now in the area?
We are.
Yoshka has called us.
He said today - wedding; tomorrow - tavern.
Are you from around here pal?
I am Trisha.
Swineherd.
And why do you need her?
Yoshka does not work with female singers.
Only tambourine and males to sing.
Didn't I tell you Mica not to come.
Come on Mica.
Beat it.
What are you waiting for?
Isn't he telling you nicely?
Clear off.
Beat it.
Why are you looking at me?
Beat it.
Go away.
Go.
I'll take you to the wedding.
I am also going there.
Slow down, easy, easy.
Girl, you filth, you stink like a cream.

Your gosh crazy mind,
If you cannot talk, you can hear.
I told you hundred times,
Don't come in without a ticket.
Why are you assailed to railway?
Well, if she were sane she wouldn't come.
You muddy boor, I did not ask you anything.
You'd better take out the leek from your ass.
And you Goca, I'll break your legs if you board the train one more time,
This is not a mad house for you to walk around.
What else is it? she put her leg on a break, saying no, no...
... winking to a godfather to start moving...
Hey my daugther, is he the one?
Adder and flirt?
Yes mother, that is him, but he is not a flirt.
What did I do to her... by kissing her?
What did I do to her... by kissing her?
Nobody needs to know it, me and her mother only.

Hey, there is no mud in this street.

Hey, only now and when rain falls.
Hey, only now and when rain falls.
Wow guys, what I ran across.
Our Goca, like a fowl, in the grass,
...in a broad daylight.
And with who?
With some itinerant laborers,
... theirs moist sun.
I said to them,
I'll take you to police, you tailless cattle.
An her, if she is looking for a wedding,
I reckon, I'd take her to see a real one.
You can trust, trust a dog, but do not trust a flirt.
You can trust, trust a dog, but do not trust a wooer.
Trustiness of wooer,

To seduce one, one little girl.

Because of a fool.

She had a beautiful daughter.
She loved her daughter more than a whole world.

You are like an picture.
One can sketch you.
Well, frankly,
It is the time for you to get married.
To settle down.
Will you, Trisha, tell me something,
But frankly, from your soul.
Have you ever been with female?
That way, you know.
I mean, as it should be.
You mother...
How big I am, but I haven't loved yet.
How big I am, but I haven't loved yet.
Fortunately, I'll start soon.
What are you using for that pitiful thing of yours, you miserable thing?
For what?
As we all know.
For pissing.
You are fools, that's you are.
Fools.
You are a free man Trisha, isn't it?
Mind your own business.
I am a free man.
Of course, I am a free man.
What do you care what are we talking about, then?
Do as you wish.
You are your own man.
Hey, here comes the chap.
Hey, here comes the chap,
Hey, he is walking with his pants raised high.
Hey, as it should be, hey, as it should be,
Hey, as it should be, to keep them off the mud.
Hey Panta, my good man.
Give a donation for a church my good man.
To raise it from the ruins.
Come on Panta.
You'll still have for a new pants.
Why is he linger round with that crazy child.
Come on.
Don't be afraid.
I won't hurt you.
I am not Yoshka.
And you cannot say absolutely nothing?
Eh, what am I going to do with you?
But I think that you can understand something.
Do you understand?
Tell me.
You know what?
Let me teach you how to play.
Hm?
Ha?
It is not so difficult, I swear to my mother.
Here, here, take it.
If I pay attention what village says,
I would never kiss a chap.
A man blew and twirled a girl.
There is one thing that is no good.
It is not good that he is doing it sneakily.
God forbid, like a man-whore.
You are very cheeky.
Why, for a God's sake Trisha?
Is it true, or not?
You are a man from the religious family.
Your father is a God fearful devotee.
And you, in the ditches, like a street dog.
Leave me alone people.
I can do what I want.
I am my own man.
And, what do you want?
Well, you cannot do everything you want.
Everything, just everything.
Do you see this money?
Do you see it?
I see, I see, I am not blind.
These are ours, from the card game.
Well, you see, when I wanted, I took it.
And when I want it, I'll throw it away.
Drunkard, you have a spotted face,
It seems to me that you'll become a musician.
We are Sremians.
We are Sremians.
We are Sremians.
Our blood is boiling.
Banging glasses, cuddling women.
That is our temper.

If I want to, I can.
Why not.

Snail put out your horns.
If you don't do it,
I'll kill you, with an axe to your head, on this green grass.
Why are always whist Goca?
Does the snail has legs mom?
Djura my child, bring me that sprit from behind the door to mix the food.
Comrade, do you know where is the school?
Go straight to the first corner.
Then turn left.
Then you go again straight to the first corner.
Then turn left.
And then?
Then you ask.
Everybody will tell you.
There is no education without culture.
I am a teacher, but I won't teach your children alphabet only.
They could stay lout as they were before.
You don't have to worry about firing.
Everything will be done properly.
I'll teach your women to paint.
Those from Uzdin has founded a painters club.
They are selling their paintings even to America.
It is better for them to sell the paintings than to whore around.
Uncle Peter,
I am painting in the fields on Sundays.
Do you know anybody who would carry my equipment?
Don't you worry, uncle Peter will take care of everything.
I have the right man for that job.
What are you doing comrade?
What is your real work?
We are, excuse us, looking after pigs.
We collect them in the morning, and return them in the evening.
You are something like a village swineherd.
That is what we are.
And our father was the same.
Listen. You are from here.
What kind of village is this one?
Village, like village miss.
Dusty.
Would you like me to teach you how to paint?
A?
We are all right and this way.
To look at you.
Dabble in good people, dabble in.
For the soul and for the church.
Dabble in.
God's temple to build, from the ruins.
To be like it was before.
Dabble in good people. Dabble in.
Give a donation for the church.
God's temple.
Trisha, trouble.
You don't respect Sunday again.
May God kill you not to kill you.
Quiet old man, we are painting, you see.
I see, I see.
You'll paint some misfortune for us.
Comrade, who is that old fool?
That is, excuse me, my dad.
Hah. That what the religious fanaticism can make of a man.
What is the box for?
Why are collecting donations?
They are doing it for our new church.
To build it.
Why new?
Is the old one not enough?
The old one was destroyed in the war.
It was its turn, I suppose.
Well, did you painted enough Trisha?
Why are you going from pale to blush?
Why are you going from pale to blush?
Why are you pale when looking at me?
Swear to my sun, I haven't seen a woman like that one.
Give me that chalk, what are you staring at?
Like painted.
Real city-girl.
I swear to God Trifun, if you continue like this, we'll have to marry you once more time.
Leave him alone. He is a family man.
Settled.
Have a child.
God forbid, and a wife.
My darling is swine herding, swine herding and for me longing.
Like you can't take a joke Trisha, for the God's sun sake.
Even if I have told you,
I did not take your eyes out,
... to your thick head.
Come on Goca.
Goca.
He is coming.
Run, you know that he does not like to see you here.
Come on, run.
Have you heard?
Run away from here.
I fuck your mother.
You are nothing to me.
Nothing.
Why my mind is in turmoil?
My sense tells me to be quiet.
Go away you both now.
Let my heart speak.
Go away you both now.
Let my heart speak.
I come to paint.
It is Sunday.
We are not going anywhere today.
We are going to paint you today.
The first look of your eye, with shine that matches the sun
Impounded my heart.
Made it a slave.
Impounded my heart.
Made it a slave.
That I love you, ah most darling,
To the whole world I'll tell.
But from you, ah most darling, my secret I will hide.
But from you, ah most darling...
I told you Trisha.
I'll paint you today.
Go away.
Eh you wretched.
To Kovin asylum you should go.
Why are you looking at me?
Go away.
You can trust, trust a dog, but do not trust a wooer.
Trustiness of wooer,
Like trustiness of a dog.
Trustiness of wooer,
Like trustiness of a dog.
You comrade, look carefully.
Look around and don't forget something.
There are no breaks for me now.
I am preparing an exhibition.
Did you take all brushes?
I did, I did.
And don't rush like a steer.
You peasants are interesting, but not for a long.
One gives you a finger, and you want a whole hand.
Pay attention, don't forget a brush sweeping cloth.
It is here, here.
Tonight I also have meeting of party secretariat.
Preparation for the October celebration.
Eh my Trisha,
It is not my fault that you are swineherd, like that bigot father of yours.
For God's name.
.. his mother.
What has happened, for the moist sun sake.
E, I am a catfish, ... to my dull head.
Even with this big plain truth, I landed to this tree.
Bad lucker, sacramental bad lucker.
If you yawed a bit, you would end up on plain.
Not a single hair would fall from your head.
What are you gazing at.
You'd better help me to get out of here.
I can only go to the village to take a ladder.
Trisha, climb that three and help the comrade.
All right, all right, just stay there.
I'll do it myself.
... your mother
Go, what are you waiting for.
Go.
Wait.
Come on now.
Hop.
Eh, bad luck, it must always happen to me.
This is the third time.
The first time I ran to the power line tower.
The second time, church steeple.
And now, here, this tree.
At the end, I'll break my neck in some pigpen.
But this time
I didn't pick up so bad place after all.
Let me introduce myself comrade.
Mile Simic.
Milanche.
Agricultural aviation pilot.
I am driving this spraying cans.
Some call them coffins.
In every bad thing there is some good.
Imagine that I crashed on an old age home.
A?
Trisha, give something more to eat.
Comrade pilot must be hungry after all he went through.
I am keeping him as a service.
He is dumb, but he is loyal.
There are five of us,
And covering the whole Srem.
I am flying from day to day.
Oh, that must be wonderful.
Always above the earth. Oh.
Earth is, please excuse me, like a huge ass.
There is nothing on it.
Most often it stinks.
I see that you are an artist.
Lady.
Well, I am entertaining myself in this wasteland.
You should, you should...
Where were you until now?
What is it Trisha?
Bring something to drink.
The bottle is empty.
I must say everything twice.
And what are you going to do now?
Mechanics will repair that trash and I'll fly again.
But don't you worry.
The next time I am crashing on the same tree.
I know your kind.
And after?
What is left?
The maiden tears.
It is not like that.
On the other hand, when you think about it, what is this life comrade?
You got out from a hole, swirl round the hole all the time, eventually into the hole...
... your mother.
Why are you not paying attention comrade?
Oh, I am sorry.
Trisha, why are you not paying attention to what you are doing?
You could my friend take a little walk?
A?
It is clear air outside.
Wonderful.
You can trust, trust a bitch, but do not trust a flirt.
Trustiness of flirt,
Trustiness of a bitch.
I don't need you Trisha till Sunday.
On Sunday, as usual,
We are going out to paint.
Come one comrade. Beat it.
Like you don't know where the door is.
It is there, there.
Behind your back,
Just turn around, and simply go out.
It is not difficult.
Swear to my mother.
Hey the last nigh a lock asked me...
Would you make love my latch?
Hey go away tatter, you already asked me that.
Hey go away tatter, you already asked me that.
Hey I have a boy beautiful like an icon.
Hey I have a boy beautiful like an icon.
Hey not even every icon is not like that.
Hey not even every icon is not like that.
Hey I have eaten bonbons.
Hey I have eaten bonbons.
Hey from my boy's blue pants.
Hey from my boy's blue pants.
I found it under the table...
...raised it.
How do I look like?
And for an airplane, how long it would take it?
It depends is it single or double wings.
What?
Well, does it have one or two wings?
Well, two.
Eh, my God, three years.
What a dullard you are Trisha.
What do you mean?
If I am repairing tractors, I could airplanes as well.
Everybody specializes in something.
Some take care of pigs, some repair tractors, and some airplanes.
But I am not the one.
You have come to the wrong address.
And that you are in hurry, that I understand.
It is not easy to deal with mustaches like that one.
He'll dismount your headmistress.
What is it, what do you want?
What are you looking for in this time?
Nothing, nothing,
I just
I was passing by, and well, I thought if I am needed.
Why you would be needed you fool.
There is nothing to do.
Come on. Go home.
Beat it.
Come on, beat it.
Well, if you need, I thought.
To paint.
I ran riot, and I'll do it again.
I ran riot, and I'll do it again.
I caressed them, but not a dark ones.
Did you see what wonder mustache thing landed among us?
Well, we could rather say he flopped down.
Not landed.
But it does not matter.
As he landed to our teacher,
He is not getting up any more.
But she is a real dragoness.
When she put you between her rods, like you entered the heaven's village.
What do you say?
What do you say?
I can't hear.
Say it louder.
My heart is breaking into four.
My heart is breaking into four.
Because of you my beautiful doll.
Move a bit, you are like a statue.
Eh, God's miracle.
Father god-fearing, and son wooer.
You are Trisha, not a very wise man.
The girl had some fun with you, and enough.
She is looking for a single guy.
Not married.
What would she do with you?
Well, listen people,
Something serious may come out of this.
Trisha is smitten.
How do you feel my son of a poor?
How do you feel my son of a poor?
Seduced by a city girl?
Waiter, give us two brandies.
Sit.
It is getting cold outside.
Air is tonight, as you said, healthy freezing.
That is the reason why is our Trisha worming up the whole evening.
Why did you isolate yourself?
He is distressed today.
This is that kind of day for him you know.
Listen you, pig's handler.
What nonsenses are you spreading around the village?
You are Trisha, a fool indeed.
Rosemary has curled up, curled up with hollyhock.
Rosemary has curled up, curled up with hollyhock.
Flirt, flirt, small devil, policemen are looking for you.
Flirt, flirt, small devil, policemen are looking for you.
Come on comrade.
Come on.
Come on, ... your bleeding sun.
Why are you so kind to him?
Don't you see that he is shocker?
He has killed.
I killed.
Not him.
I did it the last night.
She assaulted Djurica.
Goca was dull creature.
She should be in Kovin asylum long time ago.
And what do you say Trisha?
Is it correct what is your father saying.
I don't know anything.
I drank a lot the last night.
Why, why are the police after me?
Why, why are the police after me?
I did not, did not foray,
I did not, did not cheat.
I did not, did not foray,
I did not, did not cheat.
Hey people. Stop.
What has come upon you?
Where are you taking this man?
People, wait.
Wait.
Wait people, what is with you for a God's sake?
Wait people. Wait I am telling you.
Go home priest.
This is not your job.
He is going to jail.
He killed.
Who has killed?
How is this possible?
He couldn't step on an ant.
I have killed father Sava.
I should be cursed, I killed.
Doomsday is near.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
Doomsday is near.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
... on a hill, all wooer are hatching there.
I am playing well this game.
I always win.
I learnt it on a public works.
We were laying out a highway.
Oops.
Click.
Let it be, let it be
I am not playing well,
But somehow I always mop up in Rummy.
Is it?
But, I am playing honestly.
Touched, moved.
Eh, that was not a deal.
One can touch, without moving.
What and who I was touching in my life.
One thing is touching,
But another is to commit yourself.
You can trust, trust a dog, but do not trust a wooer.
You can trust, trust a dog, but do not trust a wooer.
Trustiness of wooer, trustiness of a dog.
Trustiness of wooer, trustiness of a dog
You bastard.
You raff.
You mob.
You know, honey, time has come for me to tell you.
I am not a Turk.
I cannot have two wives, even if I want to.
Tomorrow my wife Dimka is coming.
Our children are with her family in Belgrade.
We'll fly together.
That is why I am telling you to finish the game.
Catch the figure.
It will fly away tomorrow.
Girl's heart is wilting, boys are not keen in getting married.
Before the girls gets old, there will be tax on flirts.
If boys does not want to get married willingly, they should be married forcibly.
If boys does not want to get married willingly, they should be married forcibly.
Doomsday is near.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
Doomsday is near.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
Comrades. Thanks to our pilots our fields will be blooming.
And today, when we live in the time of progress.
When even the heart in our chest does not have to be our own.
Very clever chick.
Everywhere, even into the villages, new ideas should be pressed forward.
More modern.
Because, there is no economy without the culture.
Nor the culture without economy.
These are two faces of the same thing.
And when comrade Milan crashed,
I meant, landed,
That is why comrades,
Our pilot Mile, should fly on the sky for a long, long time.
And we are going to wish him farewell now.
That's right.
Long live.
Come on Mile.
Glory, glory, glory for the Serb.
Eagle is crying from the height, voice can be heard from the deep,
Don't you worry a grey bird, we all stand by you
Svetozar Miletic
Glory, glory, glory for the Serb.
We had been slaves enough,
But we are free now, don't you worry a grey bird, we all stand by you
Svetozar Miletic
... just call us and we we'll be there
Glory, glory, glory for the Serb.
Svetozar the son of Serb, we are all proud of you, don't you worry a grey bird, we all stand by you
Svetozar Miletic
... just call us and we'll be there.
We came to this plain to be seen by everybody and to remind them that we exists.
My opinion comrades is that we should not
Move from here until we get an airplane.
All villages around has one plane each, but we, as orphans...
What plane?
We won't move from here until things gets better.
That is it!
That's exactly it.
When students can do it, we can as well.
To bring in the law once for all.
Everybody to be equal.
Fuck it.
Excuse me comrade president.
You are welcome.
Worker should get what he is entitled to.
Look at us.
There is nothing a dog can bite to.
We had enough of bourgeois, even they were the red ones.
Let's comrades, send a telegram to those who are up.
To whom up?
To a pilot?
What a pilot?
You fool.
Wind, the wind is blowing, plums are falling.
Miserable poor always goes under.
Miserable poor always goes under.
My opinion comrade is this.
We who are down, we are sending telegram to those who are up.
A, what is it?
What?
According to early morning broadcasts of the Czechoslovakian free radio
Across the whole country was noticed a movement of a new occupation forces and removing the old ones.
A raising number of the occupation forces are entering the country,
And a number of foreign soldiers are
Moving from east to the west, towards Prague particularly.
Free radio is estimating that there are nearly half of a million of foreign soldiers in  Czechoslovakia.
Gunshots from automatic rifles could be heard last night in Prague.
It is reported that the occupation forces were shooting at every vehicle that was moving in through the city, even to the public safety vehicles, as well as to the vehicles that were picking up earlier wounded persons.
What are you people doing here, in this wasteland?
Looking for something?
Did you see the news comrade?
We are not really getting press around here.
I don't know.
Doomsday is near.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
What are they doing there?
What do they want?
I don't know.
Some Czechs.
Collecting donations.
What donation.
For what?
Is it for the airplane?
No, for the submarine.
Why do they need submarine?
For everybody to board, one by one.
And where to go?
Well, to go to mother's lovely c...
What are you staring at when you don't understand anything?
Come on, come on, get your things together and leave.
That was enough.
... and you brother, take care of yourself.
BEWARE OPPRESSORS OF WORKING CLASS!
Hey Yolande, Yolande,
You have big mustaches.
Hey Yolande, Yolande,
You have big mustaches.
Hey Peter, Piter, my old wooer.
Leave my mustaches alone.
Leave my mustaches alone.
Hey Yolande, Yolande, my mustached honey.
Hey Yolande, Yolande, my mustached honey.
Shave one, only one, of two of your mustaches.
Shave one, only one, of two of your mustaches.
Respected audience, thank you for coming to see our great attraction.
When I open the curtain, you'll see, sitting on the chairs,
Yolande and Peter who love each other very much.
Respected audience,
Yolande and Peter are sitting on this chairs.
I know that you don't know which one is male and which one is female.
There might be even some of you who suspects that Yolande is not a female.
Come on Yolande, show your brests to the respected audience.
That's it Yolande.
Bravo Yolande.
That's it Yolande.
Bravo Yolande.
It is over respected audience.
What are you waiting for?
Go away, the show is over.
You got more than enough for the five bucks.
Other should come as well.
Come on, go away.
What are you waiting for?
It is finished.
Come on.
What are you looking at?
Do you want me to paint you?
You look perfect for it.
Do you see this pal of mine?
They spend half of a year in a jail to paint him.
He is like an exhibition.
Everything is on him.
Well, Trisha.
Didn't I tell you not to come any more.
Well, there is something you should see.
I am telling you.
I'll show you.
Come in.
I'll leave immediately.
Swear to God.
And what is it you want to show me?
A?
You are really a cuckoo.
Well?
It was painted by a craftsman.
Cheap, 300 bucks.
He said that it will stay forever.
You are really crazy Trisha.
Aziz!
Look what Trisha did to himself.
How do you feel my son of a poor?
How do you feel my son of a poor?
Seduced by a city girl?
Seduced by a city girl?
When he felt, why he did not break his neck...
I'll drink while there is in a pot, when is gone I'll go to a tavern.
Look, this is the same thing that was at the last elections.
You should now Trisha that this is your last drink.
We are becoming poll station.
We are not a tavern any more.
Don't Yoshka.
It is not easy for a man.
One should understand him.
So young, and seduced twice.
I think people that we should leave Trisha alone.
He has lot on his mind.
You leave us.
I and Trisha, even we are arguing, we love each other.
I am not like some who talk sundry.
And there are people of all kinds.
Well, not long ago I heard some people saying that it is easy for Trisha to marry when his wives are dying like a flies.
It might be somebody, God forbid, who would say that Trisha's dad is sitting in jail for nothing.
It is a big thing.
Parental love.
Enough of it you there.
Didn't I tell you that tavern does not work today.
Elections are tomorrow.
Tavern should be repainted.
And you Trisha, for mother sake, you are drunk since morning.
The whole village does not like you anyway.
That old man I sitting in jail for nothing.
He is not drunk uncle Peter.
He just jollified.
I'll drink while there is in a pot, when is gone I'll go to a tavern
Father Sava.
Father Sava.
What is it old man?
Time to die?
Father Sava.
Oh my sweet God.
I lied.
Lied.
I did not kill.
Trisha.
My son.
Everything mine.
He killed.
Eh, ... mother's dulls.
Old men rush on to die with the priest.
Why must I play a fool here?
I don't care.
Give me that cap.
What did you say?
Well, go to...
Wind, the wind is blowing, plums are falling.
Miserable poor always goes under.
Miserable poor always goes under.
And what now Trisha?
No more hiss, hiss.
It is tough now. You run into the law.
To Aziz.
Wooer left without wooer.
Now, when he became a widower.
When he is so to speak free.
I told him nicely to leave the girl.
Not to make a fool of himself, he is already foolish.
And he grabs his knife.
Like if I am some dupe.
Come on Trisha. Take the knife now.
My heart is breaking into four.
All because of you my beautiful doll.
My heart is breaking into four.
All because of you my beautiful doll.
Do you remember when we were young?
When we were making love?
Tie him up.
You are going to ring the bells.
To ring the bells.
Better than your old man.
I was looking after pigs in the wasteland.
When sun was coming down.
I started to count them.
I count, one, two, three and four, five, six, seven, eight... eight nine, nine, nine, all, all are here, only Tris..
I mean Gedza is not.
My little Gedza, with the spotted back, with round chin, fat like a pear.
Aaaaa, Gedza,
Aaaaa, Gedza
It is Trisha, ... his sun.
Killing his wife was not enough.
Drunk cattle.
He brought pigs to shit around the church.
He killed Goca, fuck his mother.
He put his father in jail.
Not a God's church is holly for him.
No, no...
You want pigs to shit in our church, a?
Killed his wife, and father in jail.
How beautiful is richly adorned Srem, so wonderful life is there.
Girl, as vital as a cornel, so sweet is her kiss.
Srem, Srem, Srem, so wonderful life is there.
Srem, Srem, Srem, so wonderful life is there.
When Sremian goes to work, to hoe the vineyard, he takes a bottle or two,
Sremian girl kiss me.
Srem, Srem, Srem, so wonderful life is there.
ALL TO ELECTIONS
...so wonderful life is there.
Comrade Andos, it is ten o'clock, and almost whole village has voted.
Zivanovic Ivan.
How many is left?
I'll tell you now.
Seven.
What is that blockhead Trisha doing?
He must be still sleeping.
My brothers.
Today on a new temple sanctification, which we build with lot of trouble,
Remember that the one up is only one who sees everything.
He made us from the same soil.
If the sin is in you, it is not from the God.
Because the God is sinless.
And his creation as well.
If the sin is in you... daemons invaded you...
...the devil has come for his due.
I have a devilish fawn.
Devilish fawn.
In a church she leers at me.
In a church she leers at me.
Brothers.
Brothers.
Dear brothers.
Brothers.
My eyes, like two devils like two devils, could take a priest out of the altar. could take a priest out of the altar.

The End
Christmas in Beverly Hills.
A time when everyone...
... thinks only kind, tolerant,
generous thoughts.
- I went looking for you.
- What? What is it, Mushy?
- I went to the house looking for you.
- Why? What happened?
Nothing. I thought maybe you needed me.
Heart attacks, that's what I need all of you for.
Phoenix, Arizona calling, Mr. Acebos.
Hello?
Yes, operator, speaking.
Mr. Ocean doesn't answer?
Still doesn't answer. And Mr. Foster?
Of course, keep calling.
They gotta come in sometime.
Hello? Jimmy, are you in yet?
You don't even expect me.
Sorry, operator, Mr. Foster is out.
Yeah, so is Mr. Ocean.
I made it a rule not to answer the phone during December.
That's crazy. Why?
Because one December when
I picked up the phone they...
...sent me out in the snow to play with my friends.
That was at the Bulge.
Clowns they gotta be.
I like clowns but they should be funny.
It's a clown's business being funny.
And I ask you...
...what's funny about going to the pokey for 10 years?
- To me, nothing.
- Yet that's where we'll be...
...unless every bit of timing is checked and re-checked.
One more question.
Inform me frankly...
...what have I done to earn contempt?
Why should I be treated like I'm stupid?
Right, it was your scheme first.
So was the racetrack...
...the supermarket and the switch on Nelson's cars.
All my inspirations.
There isn't a man with my reputation.
So, why don't those fellows respect me?
Maybe because you just get ideas.
I just get ideas.
Be careful, she'll rub you out.
Acebos, he's insistent.
You dialed the right number.
Now please hang up and don't do it again.
- Where were we?
- Right here.
That man is gonna flip.
He got us into the deal.
Let him sweat.
He didn't silver-tongue you long,
30 seconds give or take.
You don't expect me to turn down a business opportunity.
- Especially with no risk.
- I wouldn't have it another way.
- It's time we looked up Vince Massler.
- He doesn't want in.
- Why not?
- Beats the hell out of me, sergeant.
I took him and dragged him from Solano to Siegfried line.
I may have to do it again.
Maybe he'll come gently.
Girls, time for your nap. Beat it.
- Hey!
- See you later.
- Up, lover boy. Get up.
- You're a spoilsport.
Harmon's coming in.
Should I go to the airport?
I sent Steffans there.
Everything last minute.
Harmon should've been in on the scam weeks ago.
The whole crew should.
What about this Sam Harmon?
Why from Hawaii? What's so special?
Who says he can be trusted?
Sam Harmon is Ocean's closest friend.
Another closest friend?
What about Foster?
Before Foster, from way back!
We were in the commandos.
Ocean saved his life.
Hey, Sam. Sam Harmon!
That takes care of me.
Let's get to you.
George Steffans.
Curly. Curly Steffans.
Curly. Of course,
I'd know you anywhere.
You haven't changed either.
You look great, kid.
Is Danny gonna go through with this commando raid?
Just like the old days.
Who is this Acebos? What is he?
Planning division. He dreamed it up.
Jimmy and Danny did the coordination.
What is he, a con?
- Leavenworth.
- Where'd Danny meet him?
Who knows? A racetrack, a nightclub.
- Same old Danny.
- Yeah, he likes action.
- Still married?
- Yeah, but not working at it.
That figures. Soldier, fatigue detail.
Put this footlocker in my car.
Hold it.
- What can I do for you?
- I'd like to see the proprietor.
You're looking at him.
Doesn't Tony Bergdorf own this shop?
Not anymore.
Where can I find him?
I'm a friend of his.
That's him. That's me.
What I have to tell you isn't a nice thing.
He's in prison.
- Shorty Bergdorf?
- San Quentin.
- Where can I find his wife?
- I have her address.
I'll get it for you in a minute.
May I call long distance?
- Long distance?
- I'll reverse it.
- All right.
- Thank you.
- Hello. Yes, I'll take the call.
- Go ahead, please.
Corneal, it's Mushy.
It's not Phoenix.
This is Acebos. Go ahead.
Tony Bergdorf is in San Quentin
doing one to five.
He's in prison, the electrician.
Our master electrician is doing one to five!
Make it a little short, please.
Here, Miss Allenby.
Thank you, Mrs. Bergdorf.
Mr. Allenby'll be so pleased.
- They're our very own children.
- I know.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Thank you.
Mommy's so pleased to have you home.
- Gracie!
- Roger Corneal!
- Where did you come from?
- Been a long time.
A lifetime! Wasn't it our first anniversary?
Do you remember those rum drinks?
I haven't had rum since.
Those were the olden, golden days.
- You know about Tony?
- Yes. It's a shame.
- He gets out tomorrow.
- But they gave him one to five.
They gave him an amnesty.
I don't know why.
That Danny, always a step ahead.
- Pardon?
- I'm just mumbling.
Will you have Tony call me when he gets home?
He won't be coming home.
That's finished.
I didn't know that.
Won't he see the kid?
Sure, but he'll see him at the military school...
...in the presence of Major Taylor.
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.
I can't ignore the possibility of him...
...being a bad influence on Timmy.
This time it must be Ocean.
- Hello. Who?
- Mr. Corneal.
- Corneal again.
- Will you accept the call?
Yes, I'll accept the call.
That man sure likes telephones.
Come in. I'll be right with you.
Hey, Sam. Get them up. Get them up.
You look great. Is that what a diet of wahines does?
- You get them up now.
- Shoot one in there.
Fellows, I can't hear.
You look human. Quit fighting?
Sam, I ran out of scar tissue.
Yeah, hold it a minute, Corneal.
Avail yourself of my hospitality,
Mr. Harmon.
Scotch.
Tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow morning? Wait.
Yes, proceed, proceed.
- Just listen.
- Sure, I'm listening.
I'm a very happy man.
No, no, I said I'm a... Never mind.
Go on. Thanks, Corneal.
It's excellent what you did.
Yes, excellent.
Goodbye. Another crisis lived through.
They're letting Bergdorf out.
Giving him an amnesty.
Some joke.
I bet Ocean knew it, but he wouldn't tell me.
No, he wouldn't.
He's gotta torture me.
Eat my heart out.
He likes it.
You're not making yourself popular knocking Danny.
Who's knocking him? I love him.
I respect talent.
- He should love me a little.
- Too tough. Don't ask.
How about that?
A little hand for Lolita.
Now a sweet bundle from Texas, sweet as candy.
The tantalizing Honeyface.
Sorry about the interruption.
I got a job to do.
What's the word, Vince?
- I never figured you'd go this route.
- Vince, the plan is foolproof.
I only lie to girls.
If it is, why hasn't somebody done it yet?
Same reason nobody's gone to the moon.
It's gonna be a military operation by trained men.
Why waste those tricks the army taught us...
...because it's peaceful now?
You remember a bit called Operation Gold in Oran?
Eleven of us on a beach...
...with a rubber boat and six million in gold bars.
- We should've buried them.
- We got shovels this time.
What do you say, Vince?
I can't do it.
I got my wife to think of.
- Think of her rich.
- Or me dead.
Stop talking like a kid.
You went through the war.
Why should you get dead now?
You're indestructible.
I'm sorry. I'd go along with you, but my wife...
- When does she come on?
- She's on.
- Is that her?
- Why? What're you thinking?
She's a very lovely girl.
I'd like to take you home and spread you on my waffle.
Yahoo.
There's only two.
He begs for a job.
Now he's dumping customers.
- Let's get the bum out.
- Okay, Al.
- Now?
- Now's the time.
- What's the matter with you?
- Hold it.
Hey, what's the big idea?
- Oh, stop it!
- Go that way!
- Come on, boys.
- Come on.
I didn't figure to come across a brawl so far inland.
If you still want me, I'm in.
All right, you're in.
Could be a little itchy.
I don't care. I'm tired of having bums yell at my wife.
I don't want her to take it one more night.
Neither do I, Vince.
Here, take that.
Shucks, Danny.
Cut it out. Here's a plane ticket.
When you get there...
Go to this address.
Ask for Josh Howard.
- Josh's in with you?
- Yeah.
- I feel better already.
- Good.
Heard anything about Louis Jackson?
- Salt Lake City, last I heard.
- We hear that too.
We'll see you in a few days.
What'll I tell my wife?
Tell her you love her.
That'll hold her for a few weeks.
It's fun time, Jimmy. I'll give him a party, you make drinks.
Jimmy Foster. Are you there?
How can you do this? You I relied on.
I had confidence in you.
From the other one
I knew what to expect.
He's hopeless, undisciplined.
That's why I sent you with him.
Hello, Spyros, how are you?
Get away from that phone.
I won't talk to you! I won't!
All you know is to give me heartache.
Spyros, I got good news and bad.
Don't tell me the bad.
That I got plenty. Tell me the good.
We're leaving Phoenix.
They're leaving Phoenix.
Darling, that's wonderful.
Why didn't you tell me?
Tell me what's the bad news.
We're going to Salt Lake City.
They're going to Salt Lake City.
Left, left, right, left, left...
Well, say hello to your father, Timmy.
- Hi.
- Hello, sir.
Don't I get a kiss, or are you too old for that?
Sorry, sir.
Your clothes smell funny.
- I came from a faraway place.
- I know, Japan.
That's right. Japan.
I didn't change.
I was afraid I'd miss you.
- Miss me, sir?
- Don't you go home on weekends?
Mother said you'd come to see me and I had to stay.
I'm sorry if I spoiled your weekend with her.
But maybe you and I can do something.
Maybe we can go to a movie, have ice cream?
- A football game?
- I'd like that, sir!
Good. I'll call for you next Saturday.
- Yes, sir.
- Right?
Dad!
- You won't forget, Dad?
- No, Timmy. I won't forget.
Merry Christmas, Dad.
I made it myself.
Well.
Wait a minute. Roger Corneal.
First man in the 82nd to be fined for fraternizing with the Fräuleins.
The first man to greet me. How come?
I saw Grace.
Your kid glad to see you?
- Look what he made me.
- Those beads?
It's an abacus.
You add and subtract on it.
- That is clever.
- Yeah. Grace told him I was in Japan.
She couldn't tell the kid where I really was.
No, I guess not.
How are things with you?
We need a master electrician.
- Who's we?
- Our old outfit.
You mean Jimmy Foster and...
Danny Ocean, Sam, Josh.
They all got together? What's up?
It's a reunion.
We have been getting things ready for weeks.
- Sounds like a whale of a party.
- Bigger than Anzio.
Only you won't get paid in invasion money.
It'll be the real long green.
Stacks of it.
Sounds like the kind of reunion that can put me back into Calendar Hall.
Tony. Tony.
Hup, two, three, four.
Tony?
You have to take a chance to get rich.
Look, Rog, the last joker who fed me that line was a jeweler.
He wanted me to short-circuit his alarm.
He got sixty grand, I got one to five.
I lost my wife and kid.
Funny, I thought I was doing it for her.
She always wanted a white fox stole.
This time it'll take you one to five to count your loot.
No, sorry. I got things to do on the outside.
And I'm gonna stay there.
Besides, if I went in on it, you'd be licked.
I used to be unlucky only for myself.
Now I'm unlucky for everybody.
See you around.
Didn't you get medical attention?
- Yes, sir.
- Then what made you come to me?
Dr. Griffin said
I ought to see a specialist.
He made the appointment.
Look, doc...
...give it to me straight.
Is it the big casino?
I can't tell until
I've seen the report.
What if the report says it is?
How long?
Well, I...
How long, doc?
What do you say, Tony?
You can still change your mind.
- Will it be enough for college?
- Enough to buy your kid a college.
- Come on, Josh. Your turn.
- All right.
Vince! Vincerinio!
How are you?
You're a tough guy to catch up with.
Trash is where you find it.
What happened to the ball-playing?
No see.
When I got out of the Army...
...the only club open was down South.
No outfield spot.
Imagine how I would've made out, a one-eyed third baseman.
I always leveled with you, didn't I?
I'm stringing along with this, but I'm scared.
No panic, just a little something gets me up in here.
That's the only way to be.
Makes you careful.
Look, Vince, the brave ones don't come home. You stay scared.
You were one who didn't want any brave ones with you.
That's simple enough.
In my book, bravery rhymes with stupid.
Some yellow-belly. Imagine the damn Army giving you the DSM.
I was scared the day I won that.
Don't mention it now.
My knees start to shake again.
How come this doesn't make you shake?
It does.
A million bucks apiece.
Guess you figure the odds are right?
Vince, baby boy,
I figure it is like this:
The 11 of us cats against this one little city.
We're an overlay.
Okay, pal,
I'm ready for the briefing.
Then step into my office.
- Sam Harmon.
- Well, merry Christmas, Mrs. Ocean.
What are you doing here?
Stop getting prettier.
You'll turn into a monopoly.
I asked you why are you here.
I got scared I'd get tired from those leis around my neck.
Sweet-talking Sam.
Danny still in bed?
- Not exactly.
- He's in the hospital?
- No.
- Because some doctor called...
...and said Danny was very sick.
Frankly, that doctor was me.
In fact the message said he was dying.
I wanted to make sure you'd come.
- Dying was what gave it away.
- You knew it was a gag?
It's the sort of stunt Danny usually pulls.
Why'd you come over if you knew?
It's Christmas. I have a present for him, simple as that.
Now what's your excuse?
I was wondering.
I come to the conclusion...
...it must be love. Mother love.
I'll consider mistress, toy for a night...
...but I refuse to be your mother.
You got it all wrong. I'm the mother.
I just don't like you and Danny busting up.
Yeah.
We're sort of eye to eye there.
I'd like to straighten him out.
No, Mother.
He's the only one who can do that.
What happened to your marriage, Bea?
It drowned in champagne.
I didn't think it got boring on cloud nine.
Boring, no. I just woke up one morning and realized...
...there was nothing but thin air.
So I got off at the next mountain, walked down and got a job.
Danny didn't like that very well.
And a little later I left him.
How'd he feel about that?
He wants me back, but not enough to give me what I want.
Such as?
I want a life that doesn't depend on the color of a card.
Danny ran into a little bad luck?
If only he had.
Might've made him realize...
...what things mean when you earn them.
We didn't have a home.
We had a floating crap game.
That's a way of running away from life.
- I better go.
- Danny'll be here any minute.
I have a job to get back to.
I don't wanna see him anyway, Sam.
Just no point in it.
Danny's not the only one running.
Don't hack at me, Mother.
His luck is bound to run out.
If he still wants me, I'll be around.
- Hello, Danny.
- Wait a minute.
Down, please.
I came in with a fellow.
A fickle fellow.
You stick with me. I'm sincere.
I got great news.
Auburn beat Alabama.
No, this is important, honestly.
Come on back upstairs for five minutes.
- No, Danny. Down, please.
- Up, all the way.
The Skyroom's not open yet.
- Fine.
- Why do I always give in?
Not another round.
I'm out of training.
- It's a truce. Peace talk.
- You always start that way.
Just sit there and don't interrupt me.
I've got a big deal going on.
Large chips, carloads.
- That sounds familiar.
- But this time it's true.
Oh, good. I like to have rich friends.
One friend who wants to spend a bundle on you.
- Gee, thanks.
- Okay, that's settled.
On January 2nd, I'll pick you up and we're gonna hop down to Rio.
You're serious?
I honestly think you're serious.
Of course I am.
- A week's trip to Rio.
- Yes.
Oh, Danny, what a prize you are.
The only husband who'd proposition his wife.
I married you. It didn't work out.
What's wrong with some hey-hey?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
I'd never knock it if there was love involved.
- You mean there isn't?
- On your part, not much.
There's only one thing you love,
Danny. Danger.
Cliffhanging.
You'd never love a woman like you love danger.
As long as you're lucky you'll stay in love with danger.
- As long as it keeps coming up heads.
- Let's say you're right.
- But I did not invent myself.
- What does that mean?
I don't own the patent. I can't change it any more than you can.
Anyone who says he can is a liar.
I didn't expect you to be perfect.
- Going down.
- Just a second.
You could have given me a break.
I don't expect you to be perfect.
I want you to be my husband.
Going down.
- Where do they serve the drinks?
- The bar.
- James.
- Hello there, Sam.
Don't stop.
I'm just calling Mother.
- Hello.
- Mrs. Restes' residence.
- Is Mother there?
- Yes, Mr. Foster.
- Oh, it's my Jimmy, my innocent.
- Another innocent touch.
- Jimmy. Where have you been?
- Here and there.
It was wicked not to telephone.
- We've been home days.
- What? We?
We? We means your poor Ionely mother and Mr. Santos.
I wrote you about him, I think.
He's been very kind and a financial genius.
- What I hoped you'd be.
- Yes, Mother. Speaking of finances.
- Could you let me have some more?
- Some more what?
Money. M-O-N-Y.
- E!
- Yeah, M-O-N-E-Y.
Yes, darling.
Tell me what you want it for.
I plan to paper the walls with it.
I try to take an interest
in you, you snap my head off.
How do I know what I'll spend it on?
It just goes, you know?
You mean spending money.
Why didn't you say so?
I was afraid you'd consider an investment.
No, Mother, nothing foolish.
Hurry over and bring me a big kiss.
I wanna see my big boy.
Yes, Mother. I'll be there around 5.
What a way to make a living.
Let's have a quick briefing on Hawaii.
Hawaii? Oh, great sunsets.
One a day, but they're working on it.
- Weather good to get me up?
- Sometimes it rains.
- And how about the women?
- Sometimes it rains.
Did you take a good look at Bea?
Not really.
The play went around the other end.
- She's still in love with Danny.
- Then what's the problem?
- Yeah, I'm worried about him.
- Worried?
- Maybe the project worries you.
- Could be part of it.
You trying to salt the clouds, spoil the picnic?
Jimmy, what do you need this picnic for?
All you have to do is yell for Mother.
You haven't met Mother.
No, but I gather she's very generous.
Generous to a fault.
Especially when it comes to husbands.
She only had five.
That must have left you out in the cold?
No such luck.
Would you mind spelling that out?
I had so much mother-Iove, you'd have thought I was quintuplets.
Everything was done for me.
After the war I tried to break away.
But money's a hard habit to kick.
That's why I'll go to our picnic.
Well, the Hawaiian hotshot.
- Hi, Danny.
- Sam, how are you?
Same as always. I feel the thrill of life along the keel.
You sound like a ferryboat.
I'm not a boat, I'm a manly slope.
- People stare at me in admiration.
- What happens?
Let's get back to how I was.
I was fine.
Will you get Spyros on the phone?
I got into this caper so I could see you again.
Sounds like a hell of a price.
I'm worth it.
In time for the jokes.
For you, Mr. Acebos. Very important.
- Hello.
- The Los Angeles County morgue.
Los Angeles County morgue. Yes?
We have a couple of men here.
One is well-muscled and the other slender.
My goodness.
These fellows were traveling fast in an automobile.
Their names are...
Never mind, never mind their names.
I know the... I knew them.
Would you identify them?
I'm willing. I'll come down.
I'll be right there.
My goodness, yes.
And what is your name, please?
Just ask for Detective Brannigan.
Detective Bra...
How did he get my name?
Let's saddle up. Let's go.
I finally caught up with you.
Where have you been for days?
You back with your wife?
I know she was in this hotel with you an hour ago.
You're two-timing me, and I'm warning you, Danny...
...I'm one girl you can't treat this way. I won't be neglected.
- What do you plan to do about it?
- I'm going to do just plenty.
- Isn't it time you got started?
- Wait a minute.
No, you wait and listen to me carefully.
I picked you up at the Biltmore because you're attractive.
I made a pass at you for that reason.
Nobody twisted your arm...
...made you any promises. So, what is this act? Not outraged virtue.
You really are a rat.
Let it go, Adele. I know about the guys you've had. You told me.
I didn't do anything.
Neither did I.
So why don't we say goodbye?
Surely. And maybe I should say thank you for being humiliated.
Well, put this in your pipe.
One of these days I'll break your back! I swear it!
- Good thing she doesn't pack a knife.
- How do you know?
To the morgue.
You...
You low, miserable...
I cry but not for you.
For my money you could drop dead.
I think he's mad. Back to the hotel.
You stay right here.
You, come out of that cab.
So I'm mad, I'm entitled!
Okay, Spyros, we accept your apology.
No phone call.
With all these jokes you forgot to call who should be here.
I wanted to check on you.
- See if you're still alive.
- Alive?
Well, you're so apoplectic.
My health is my greatest virtue.
Every day I do exercises.
Everybody'll be here at 9:00.
Then you can entertain us by doing some deep knee-bends.
- Good evening.
- My mother home?
- She expects you, but she's upstairs.
- Thank you.
- You must be Jimmy.
- That's correct.
Your mama will be down in a minute.
I'm Duke Santos.
I'll wait in here.
Must be a funny feeling...
...meeting a stranger, your stepfather.
I think it's only natural if you resent me a little.
Then you won't mind if I don't call you Dad.
Duke's okay.
Oh, it's the engagement ring
I bought your mama.
That's nice. Zircon, isn't it?
- Zircon? That's a diamond!
- I'm sorry.
You probably thought that because it's so big.
Is it too big?
Your mama's got wonderful taste.
Has she?
All right, rich boy.
You want it that way, you got it.
Let's see how fat you get tangling with me.
I know your record and your connections.
A lot of loot and a rough guy to cross.
But I still reserve the right to dislike you.
Sure, sure. A man marries your mama...
...like I said, it's natural.
Takes time.
- You'll find I can be a good Joe.
- I'll tell the FBI.
Oh, they're not looking for me anymore. I'm clear now.
That's one point for Mother.
Easy for you to look down on people, isn't it?
All this ever since he was a baby.
You ever make a buck yourself?
No, but I have plans.
Know what I had as a kid?
A lot of nothing.
Nobody to help me either.
Now I got a lot of everything.
Got a lot of years too, and a sick stomach.
Proves that my way's better.
- What way?
- Choose rich parents.
Yeah, you bet that's better.
My folks are so poor I walked
New York barefoot winter and summer.
One day I'm swimming in the river.
When I come out I seen shoes on the wharf.
One pair brand-new.
I put them on. They fit.
Then some kid yells, " Them's my shoes! " So we fight. I win.
It's been that way since.
Fight, all the time.
- You always win?
- Sure, I got the guts!
Like you when you was in the 82nd
Airborne. Your mama told me.
I've often wondered if I'd have the guts to jump out of a plane.
Only for money.
Or if I was young.
You gotta be young to do anything.
Loosen up.
Have a drink to my wedding.
Why not?
- Soda?
- What about you?
Not me. I told you, delicate.
Come on, Mr. Santos.
Fight, always fight.
You got the guts, you win.
- Yeah, but...
- What's the matter? Run out of guts?
- Darling! At last.
- Hello, Mother.
What's wrong with Duke?
A slight attack of courage.
We had a drink.
He knows he can't touch it.
He told me.
Naughty of me, wasn't it?
Indeed. Not congratulating me is naughty too.
I'm sorry. Bon voyage.
It must seem I'm on a marital merry-go-round...
...trying for all the rings, but this is different.
You can say that again.
I know his background is impossible...
...but please don't judge him from that view.
What view do you suggest?
- A woman's.
- I find that impractical.
Try. Since your father died...
...Duke is the only man who's ever needed me, not my money.
All right, I won't be critical.
And now speaking of money...
- Here it is.
- Thank you.
A woman loves to be needed. Duke is the most important thing.
Outside of you. So please be nice.
When I get back I'll butter him up.
Sorry I needled him.
Where are you going?
I'm going skiing with Danny Ocean.
You won't miss the wedding?
- Have I ever missed one of them?
- Yes, the first one.
- Bye.
- Bye, darling.
It's after 9.
Everybody's here but this Jackson.
Shall we start without him?
Lack of organization, it's a poison!
It poisons enterprise, kills it dead, dead.
The point in having money is so that people know you got it.
I'll get me a big Chris Craft and not put into water.
Just leave it in my driveway.
Give it to the mailman or somebody.
Why don't you use it to improve yourself?
I don't need improving.
I'm all right the way I am.
Gin.
I played it like a god.
How many points?
They got 10 points.
Why don't you guys be smart?
Why don't you put your loot in with me? I'll produce my own pictures.
I gotta listen to all this.
They're rotting my brain.
So where is this Jackson?
Where is the organization?
Don't panic, will you?
You know, it's a good idea.
Take a few big ones and do something for world peace.
Like buying out the Miss Universe contest.
Just sit around and talk to the girls.
Find out how things are in Sweden.
Or invite them for a weekend to New Orleans.
I don't like that approach.
Use your loot right...
...you can order them to New Orleans.
- Explain that, professor?
- By turning money into power.
I'll buy votes and go into politics.
Good idea, big boy.
You'd make a good notary public.
He'd make a better coroner.
A laughing coroner.
- I'm going into politics.
- Your platform, Big Sam?
Repeal the 14th and 20th amendment, make slaves out of women.
That's real constructive.
Hey, will it cost much?
No, we'd have the price controlled.
Vote for Sam Harmon.
Stamp out mental health.
- Got a better platform?
- Sure.
Settle for an appointment.
That's deep thinking. I'd like you to meet our latest senator.
What a terrible thought.
Become an ambassador in a foreign country.
A little country.
We don't want a big enemy.
Yeah, little country like Andorra.
- Or Pomona.
- Little Rock?
You have any idea how much money a man can steal...
...if he was commissioner of Indian Affairs?
- That's what I'll be.
- That you'll never be.
I'll be secretary of the interior.
I won't appoint you.
That's a snobbish idea.
- Won't you?
- I won't.
Certitude went out with equestrian statuary.
- What kind of language is that?
- Beats me.
If you ask me, that cat's a spy there.
So where is this horse-wrangler? 9:30!
Still in Salt Lake City, saying goodbye to his wives.
- And his horses.
- Yeah.
Up and down.
And the houseboy's night off yet.
- Mr. Acebos?
- Who's asking?
He is.
Do you know him?
Oh, Jackson. Louis, my boy...
What's wrong?
Louis, you did something?
No, we wanted to be sure he got to the right place.
The Beverly Hills police.
The best in America.
They protect us night and day.
Thank you, officer.
Good night. You're crippled!
That's the way we found him.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Louis, my boy, come in.
I couldn't be in error, could...?
I couldn't be in error, could I?
Your name couldn't be otherwise than Jackson?
No, I reckon that's my name, partner.
Don't tell me why you had to come in such a pitiable condition.
Suits me, Mr. Acebos.
Hello, Danny.
Hello, cowboy. What took you so long?
Hot damn, what a foxhole.
Howdy, you all.
- Hello, Josh.
- How are you?
Good. Great. Sam?
Ocean, you should be ashamed of yourself.
Enticing a broken-armed man into a project.
You know your problem?
You underestimate people. Louis?
What's with the broken arm?
Why shucks, Mr. Acebos, it's all healed now.
You knew, you Dracula. You want to worry me into an early grave.
Lieutenant, brief your group.
Anyone not at ease, get that way.
Some of you already have an idea of the plan of this operation.
I want to point out that everyone turned up.
Not one goof-off.
This is a hell of a good sign.
Lieutenant, you and the sergeant ought to feel proud.
How about the bad news?
Sergeant Ocean.
This is our objective.
Las Vegas, Nevada.
Mission? To liberate millions of dollars.
Now these are the casinos we hit:
Sahara, Riviera, Desert Inn, the Sands and the Flamingo.
H hour is New Year's Eve.
Units involve...
...teams made up of former
82nd Airborne members.
How did you figure this was a job for old paratroopers?
Why not get some heist guys?
For the best reasons, Mr. Harmon.
A man with a criminal record can't get near Las Vegas or the casinos.
That lets me out.
You're no hoodlum.
No connection with the underworld.
Hoods always mix with other hoods.
Where there're hoods, there're stool pigeons. But with us, no leaks.
You five guys, which hotels you in?
- Flamingo.
- The Sands.
- Desert Inn.
- Riviera.
Sahara.
There'll be five more men working with you guys as teams.
Sam, give me a rundown on the exact action on New Year's Eve.
At midnight they go nuts.
Everybody kisses.
Then they sing, " Should auld acquaintance be forgot."
- How long does it take to sing that?
- I don't know.
One minute and 38 seconds exactly.
We timed it.
After midnight we black out...
...the whole town and hit the five casinos.
Sahara, Riviera, Desert Inn...
...the Sands and the Flamingo.
Nobody will even see us.
You got a question, Tony?
How do you black out a whole town?
What happens if you knock out one of these towers?
- You'll get a short circuit.
- That's interesting.
Reimer and Josh are the demolition men. What's my job?
You open the doors to the cashiers' cages.
They are controlled electrically.
The cashier can open them by pushing a button.
But I can't push it from the outside.
But that's where you're gonna push it from.
Every casino's got a motor that generates power...
...for the tables and cages when the cable fails...
...which happens quite often.
The motor kicks in, and they're back in business.
Except they won't on account of you, Tony.
What happens if you cross the wires...
...that operate lights with the cage doors' wires?
When the motor kicks in, instead of the lights going on...
...the doors click open.
It's as simple as that.
But I have to study the main switch box in each casino.
Oh, but you will, you will.
Is this the only road in or out?
Yeah, that's route 91. Why?
I remember reading about this guy in Perth.
Is this another of your stories?
- Who cut up his grandmother.
- Fellows, let him talk.
And mailed her out of town.
- He ran out of stamps.
- Which proves something crucial?
Pete's got a very good point.
Getting it out of town, that's another thing.
- That's where Josh comes in.
- I wondered.
Don't wonder. He's the main cog.
- Lf he goofs, it's over.
- What's wrinkling you, Curly?
How long will it stay dark?
- 10, 15 minutes.
- That's not much time.
It's plenty if everyone does what he should.
Danny is right.
You should all move like clockwork.
Seventeen jewel.
Boys, you should think of this as a full-fledged battle.
Leap into it with the same hearts...
...that got you across the Rhine River and...
...other historical places.
Just think how proud...
...the big brass in the Pentagon...
...would be knowing that their labors made...
...this beautiful operation possible.
They'd all sit down in the officers' mess...
...and have a good cry from happiness.
Even I myself am a little bit tempted.
- Any further questions?
- Yeah. What's your job, Acebos?
Yeah, Mr. Acebos, what you all gonna do?
Our modest friend here is a known felon.
They take one look at him and we're kaput.
- That's it.
- More questions? Anybody worried?
I got a suggestion.
- What is it, Sam?
- Forget it.
Forget...?
Forget the whole deal.
I like to swing like you...
...but you ain't got a plan here.
Is this another of your morbid jokes,
Danny, you sadist?
- What's wrong with our story, Sam?
- For one thing, 15 years.
This isn't a combat team.
You wanna claim you're half the man you were in '45?
Can you run as fast?
Can you mix it up as good?
I sure can't.
Danny, catch lightning, but don't try and catch yesterday.
Old times are only good when you've had them.
Sam...
...some guys grow old without turning chicken.
Did you hear about it?
Lieutenant Lionheart, you're brave.
But how dumb are you? I'm the only one that knows Las Vegas.
Believe me, the percentage is always with the house.
It's with the people rigging the game, us.
You are a deserter under fire, a traitor!
Shut up. I'll step on you.
You can't let him walk out like this.
It disrupts the entire plan!
Got an idea on how to stop him?
- You saved his life!
- I'm trying to save his life!
Sam.
Thank you, Danny.
You don't owe me, Sam. You're entitled to your opinion. You agree?
What about you, Josh? You got brains.
I got brains, Sam, but I gotta go with Danny.
It only leaves us one man short.
One man short.
That's nothing, nothing!
Danny, darling, just run a want ad!
We'll have to leave out one of the casinos.
Hold it. Nobody's walking out.
I'm certainly not gonna let you boobs...
...pull this job without your best man.
So go ahead.
When do we blow this mausoleum?
Cuckoo!
Day after tomorrow we'll be in Las Vegas.
Happy New Year!
Spray the stuff on your shoes?
That infrared paint isn't ready for the public!
- I can't see a footprint.
- Of course you can. Try this.
Nothing. Danny's off his rocker!
Cool it. Put these on.
Go ahead, put them on.
Now look.
Wow!
I got an extra can of this jazz.
Don't be stingy with it, okay?
- Hey.
- What?
Mix this with makeup. It would make for interesting midnights.
I'm hipped.
One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four. Three, two...
Come on, kids.
Hup, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four. One...
Hey, kill it.
Go on, Helen. Get in there.
You got a tough job.
Why so many barrels?
When it's à la carte, then we get sensible garbage.
We'll have none of that.
- Sorry. Hi.
- Hello, Mr. Skelton.
- You remember me?
- I remember what you told me too.
About putting a limit on myself?
Don't take that seriously.
You'd break me like a twig if I cashed one of your checks.
Don't pay attention to that.
This is all solid flab.
I can't pull a bee's wings.
Cash the check.
No use arguing.
We won't let you exceed your limit.
Unbelievable.
Get a load of this guy.
He acts like we were gonna stick up the joint. We wouldn't.
- Ridiculous. Cash the check.
- This gentleman is waiting.
Buddy boy, I'm standing right here like an elm...
...until you cash that check.
You ought to be more careful.
I may win this casino.
The whole joint could be mine.
What cashier's nose would be out of joint? What's up?
Had to send for Wyatt Earp and his fat brother.
It's okay.
That's my old slot-machine arm.
Silver dollars, please.
Coffee, please.
Could you light me up, please?
I had the key made.
Be careful with it. Cost two bits.
Somebody should keep an eye on this spending.
- Here's one for the Sahara.
- Right.
Looks like you're getting combat fatigue.
You been up on that line a long time.
- Everything all right, Joe?
- Like tulips in July, Mac.
You wanna get a split.
- Come on, Josh.
- I can if you'll cool it.
Be sure you let go of the ball.
- What'd you find out?
- Casinos don't like to be robbed.
That's narrow-minded.
The wire-crossing work?
- Technically everything works.
- How long will it take to rig them?
Five casinos, 15 minutes each.
That's 75 minutes.
Traveling time 25 minutes.
An hour and 40 minutes.
That's when I'll rig them.
- Can't you preset them so it's ready?
- Can't take the chance.
If the cable fails legitimately, those doors spring open.
- Did you pick a tower?
- The biggest.
Josh will give you a hand.
What about the Sahara?
One security cop got me bugged.
He sits in the cage. Must have arthritis. He never moves.
A left hook'll keep him that way.
- Sam?
- As steady as down-country loving.
Good boy.
Louis, the Desert Inn?
It'll be just as easy as riding a stuffed horse.
- How's that?
- It'll be as...
Forget it.
- Jimmy?
- Flamingo's all set.
What about the Sands?
Smooth and level.
Nobody carries identification until it's done.
Everybody with an inside job, go back.
The rest of us will be outside.
Stand in front of your casinos till I contact you.
What we gonna do?
We have all today and tomorrow.
Hey, I got an idea.
A therapeutic idea.
Forget it. No, no.
Today and all day tomorrow we rehearse until H hour.
- Transportation?
- Have no fear, little Josh is here.
- Let's go. Mushy's up.
- You make it.
- I never bowled in my life.
- Fake it.
- Do we have time for a show?
- What about the Sands lounge?
- Good idea.
- That's my lucky spot.
Someone you know?
I recognized somebody from the profession.
Yours or his? Come on.
- Well, well, well.
- What are you doing here?
Same thing you are, cheating.
You've got me wrong.
I'm here on business.
I expect my party any minute.
I'd like to see her.
And I'll bet your wife would too.
You don't understand.
I'm all alone.
- Cross my heart.
- I hope you die.
Take your hands off me, or I'll call that cop.
Let's not panic.
When you realize how wrong you are...
...use that.
Hello?
Mrs. Ocean? This is a friend.
I'm calling from Las Vegas.
I think you'd be interested to learn what your husband...
... is up to in Vegas.
I was taught that creatures like you rattled before they struck.
And I didn't hear a thing.
I did you a favor.
Sorry I disturbed you.
No, Malicious. I'm not disturbed.
When I learn Danny has an enemy as venomous as you...
...it just makes me love him more.
Call me anytime.
Love to have you waste your money.
Happy burial, dead dog.
- Are you all ready, Pete?
- Just a second.
- What time?
- One minute, 38 seconds past 12.
- It's five after 6.
- Right.
One minute and 38 seconds past 12:00, big daddy...
...and then happy New Year!
Happy New Year. Come on, let's go.
- Good evening, Mrs. Restes.
- Hello!
- Nice to see you. Happy New Year.
- Same to you.
Las Vegas is like Paris.
You run into people you know.
- And wish you hadn't.
- My sentiments exactly.
Excuse me, honey. I wanna go outside.
I adore running into friends.
- It's certainly our pleasure.
- Is Jimmy joining us?
No, he's shivering in Squaw Valley.
- But he's here.
- Here, in Vegas?
At the Flamingo.
I saw him last night.
Don't tell me he broke something skiing.
Nothing that showed.
Why would he tell me he was going to Squaw...? I'm stupid.
He ran into some jiggly little number who was Vegas-bound.
Jiggly little number isn't the way
I'd describe Danny Ocean.
He's more like a well-mannered shark.
Twenty-five dollar chips, please.
Tony! It's me, Steffans. Tony!
Are you nuts? Get away!
- Will you make it?
- You'll know.
Okay, I'll see you at the blowoff.
He said it was a lady's drink.
I think he meant a lady horse.
He meant one at a time, honey.
Lucky I can hold my liquor.
You can get to the room by yourself?
I got a date in the casino. Your key.
You're wasting your time with that Clyde, honey. He's a loser.
I'm so drunk I couldn't lie down without holding on.
Get her out of here!
Here you are, missy.
Happy New Year to you!
I do not know who you are, my good fellow.
Who do I have to be to wish you a happy New Year?
Ricky Nelson.
I used to be Ricky Nelson.
I'm Perry Como now.
No, you're not. You moved.
Smart girl. About this night air, let's get in out of it. Come on.
Is it New Year's yet?
Too close for comfort. Come on.
I hate it too. I hate holidays. Do you like holid...?
- Give me a kiss. How about it?
- Sound idea.
- I'll be there in a minute.
- I'll wait for you.
You know something?
- I think I kiss better when I'm drunk.
- Some other time.
Where you going?
After all we've meant to each other,
I must leave you.
- Hey now. This is a dirty deal!
- Our first quarrel.
I don't fit into your picture?
From here on in you don't, sweetheart.
- Good night.
- Good night.
It's okay, man.
It's okay. It so happens
I'm very much in demand.
Maestro! Ladies and gentlemen, it's almost midnight.
So pucker up your lips, ladies,
20 seconds to go.
...ten, nine...
...eight, seven, six, five...
...four, three, two, one.
Happy New Year!
Lights! Lights! Darn that cable.
It's the second time this month.
The lights will be back on any minute.
Once more, George.
Keep playing until the lights come on.
Pardon me. Wrong girl.
Douse those lights.
Now sing loud and clear.
Sing louder.
With the music now.
When shouldn't it be forgot?
Blow out the candle. Blow!
All right, sing. It's a party.
Loud and clear.
Do what he says, Charlie.
Trick or treat.
You too, let's make it a duet.
A little louder.
We've been hit.
- We've been tapped.
- What?
We've been held up. Robbed.
The sheriff's office. Hurry!
- Sheriff Wimmer?
- Sheriff Wimmer speaking.
- Flamingo speaking. We been tapped.
- We'll be right over.
The Flamingo.
Roll cars 620, 622 and 624.
Roll more.
They knocked over the Sands.
Happy New Year!
- How'd it come off?
- Like a charm.
Same here. Fantastic.
All cars, cover all entrances and exits.
Sands, Sahara, Flamingo,
Desert Inn, Riviera.
Check everyone who leaves.
Did you get a look at them?
Any kind?
What? In the dark?
Did you hear anybody say anything?
- He said we should sing.
- He said you should sing.
This is Don Murphy speaking for station KLAS-TV in Las Vegas, Nevada.
We're at the Hotel Riviera.
You'll hear some reports...
...of this robbery from eyewitnesses.
You have something to say?
If you're gonna interview people, pick elderly couples.
The others don't always belong together.
- Don't look now. It's little old me.
- How'd your action go?
- I was ashamed to take the money.
- Good boy. Get lost now.
305 and 309, reinforce roadblocks extending to Barstow. Acknowledge.
Get a rundown on every train leaving Vegas, east and west.
Things went too easy.
Tony!
Never the luck, never the luck.
- Tony!
- Tony!
Okay, folks, get back. Okay.
- Call for an ambulance, quick.
- Okay, but this guy's dead.
Tony's just another guy who died in the street.
- Lot of guys die in the street.
- Sure.
Happens all the time.
- No sweat.
- No sweat.
Yes, I heard you.
Check all outgoing flights.
Car 306. 306, come in, please.
I want every piece of luggage examined.
306, proceed with plan 22. Over.
If they don't cooperate, let's find out why.
- I can 't do it.
- What do you mean, you can't?
- How'd it go?
- Smooth as a peeled egg. You?
Things happen that can break you up.
- Like what?
- Tony's dead.
- Bergdorf?
- Heart attack, crossing the street.
- Cops got to him.
- They'll check up on him.
What are they gonna find?
Nothing. Nobody'll ever know.
Yeah, no one but us.
Don't hit me on the head with that.
I'll tell the other men.
Then they won't panic.
The plan's the same.
The money stays where it is.
Nobody checks out.
Go back to your job.
I'll contact you later.
He's taking it hard.
Yeah. Long time since he lost a man in combat.
- Somebody stole millions?
- Yes, but there's still some left.
Would you move along, please?
The sheriff's office and the police assured us...
...we'll have a capture by morning.
Thank you very much, sir.
And there you have it.
Millions are missing, stolen by several men.
But they're being tracked down as they skulk down dark roads...
...where the long arm of the law reaches out.
- Happy New Year, officer.
- Yeah, say...
What's going on?
Will you get this truck out of here?
I'll be glad to do that there.
Happy New Year!
Oh, my goodness!
Danny.
I'll tell you why we're meeting, but get one point straight.
We're not the sole owners.
We have partners we have to answer to. Right?
- You can say that again.
- Mine are coming after me.
Mine are not happy either.
They gave me a free hand to make a deal.
What deal? For what?
To get our money back.
Now, how about it?
- You boys empowered to make a deal?
- I am.
Good. Duke Santos is coming in to see us.
- Duke Santos?
- Just doesn't figure.
If he pulled a robbery, he'd have his lawyers do it.
Yeah, I know the firm.
- Yes?
- Mr. Santos.
Send him in, please. I don't know how you fellows feel about it...
...but I'm glad he's interested.
- Mr. Santos, my name is Strager.
- Glad to meet you.
I want you to meet my friends.
Mr. Brice, Mr. Gillette,
Mr. Freeman, Mr. McCoy.
- Hi.
- Won't you sit down?
We were just saying how happy we are to get your call.
I'll get your money back.
Mr. Santos doesn't make a promise he can't keep.
- No doubt about it.
- First time I relaxed.
How much is it going to cost us?
Let's say I wanted a third and...
...you fellows beat me down to 30 percent.
Okay?
And if he doesn't deliver he gets nothing.
- Naturally.
- I'll certainly go for that.
Our insurance won't even pay 20 percent.
Neither will ours.
But that's a big finder's fee.
That all depends on what the finder's looking for.
Okay, I'll go along.
- Me too.
- So will I.
All right, but how about taking some of it in chips?
We would like a chance to win it back.
Would you now?
Okay, you got it.
For 30 percent of what they took out, heads or tails.
No, thanks, Mr. Santos.
I got partners. They wouldn't...
...want me to make a bet like that.
So what do you do?
- Shut up. And that's what I'm doing.
- Good.
I'll expect the cooperation of the local sheriff.
- You'll arrange it for me?
- Consider it done.
Mr. Santos...
...may I ask a question?
- Lf it's the right one.
You're not getting involved for the dough.
What's your real reason?
Well, frankly, whoever pulled this job...
...shouldn't have done it while I was in town. It's embarrassing.
- Call the sheriff for me?
- It'll be taken care of.
The report on Bergdorf.
- Who?
- The dead man we brought in.
The guy got a Purple Heart.
Sheriff, Mr. Strager on three.
- Yes?
- We made a deal with Duke Santos...
- Duke Santos!
- We get our money back.
- I'm pleased for you.
- He's at the Riviera. Talk to him.
Sure. Of course, I'll talk to him.
Locate the wife.
Pump her. She may know something.
I'll be at the Riviera with Mr. Santos.
- Call me if you find out anything.
- Okay, skipper.
Come in.
- Hello?
- Mr. Ritsik doesn 't answer.
Joe Ritsik don't answer?
Operator, honey, you're wasting my time.
Don't wanna know about guys who don't answer.
Try the Terre Haute card.
Manny Ruditski or Willy Henshaw.
He's listed.
So is Fred Cusik in Palm Beach.
- Try them all.
- I'll do my best.
Thattagirl. Get me some numbers that answer.
Mr. Santos, Sheriff Wimmer.
Nice of you to drop by so soon, sheriff. Sit down.
I guess you understand my position,
Mr. Santos.
We're grateful for your work.
But don't cut out on your own.
Whatever I get goes straight to you.
What's new on your end?
We had a net over the highway minutes after the alarm.
They got out only by seconds.
So it don't count?
They get disqualified?
Shows they're a professional outfit.
- Is there another kind?
- Look...
Sheriff, don't get your feathers ruffled.
Your sources can check any outfit?
You bet your boots they can!
- Hello?
- This is Manny.
- Manny. What'd you hear?
- Nothing, not even a smell.
Nothing? Not a smell?
What's this? You keep nosing around till you do get a smell.
You know how it is.
You gotta give it a little time.
- Hello.
- Sheriff Wimmer.
- Just a second. It's for you, sheriff.
- Thanks.
- Hello.
- This is Joe.
- I talked to his wife.
- Does she know anything?
- She hasn 't seen him.
- The whole time he was in prison?
- She's claiming the body?
- To take it to...
She can take it to San Francisco.
Turn him over to Cohen's Mortuary.
They'll ship him out.
- What was that about?
- Guy died last night in front.
Quite a hero. Purple Heart.
Served with the 82nd Airborne.
The 82nd Airborne?
Yeah, served in San Quentin too.
I gotta get back.
So long, Mr. Santos. Keep in touch.
And is it vice versa, sheriff?
We understand each other, certainly.
So long, sheriff.
You'll hear from me.
- Hello.
- Mr. Henshaw is expected.
Never mind, operator.
I'll call him later.
And don't make any more calls for about an hour.
Mr. Cohen?
I'm Mr. Kelly. My Cohen is my associate. He's occupied.
- May I be of some service?
- The sheriff sent over a body?
Yes, a Mr. Bergdorf. Must've been a fine-Iooking fellow in life.
With the compliments of Mr. Strager.
I'm helping to investigate last night's robbery.
A shocking thing.
If somebody shows an interest you should call me right away.
I'm Duke Santos. I'm at the Riviera.
You can tell Mr. Strager he can depend on us.
He said he could, yeah.
And, Mr. Kelly, please...
...not a word about this to anyone?
Not even to Mr. Cohen.
A job this big, and nobody knows who did it?
We're digging, but so far, nothing.
- There ain't a single break?
- Nothing.
Okay, Fred. Keep listening.
- Hi, honey.
- Hello, darling.
Excuse me, but this is the first opportunity I've had.
Operator, the Flamingo, please.
I had a date with Adele.
You must be starved.
I got other problems.
I can't have lunch.
I asked friends to join us.
You won't be Ionesome.
Make it quick. I got calls coming.
Flamingo? I'd like to speak to Mr. James Foster.
Who did you say?
Jimmy's there.
He didn't go to Squaw Valley.
Operator, if his room doesn't answer, have him paged.
Wouldn't you think he'd call?
He knows very well I'm here.
Wait'll he hits the crap tables.
He only thinks of me when he needs something.
What does he see in Danny Ocean and those Army cronies?
They always hold meetings.
- I'm paging him.
- Yes, I'll wait.
They're meeting? Why'd he say he's going to Squaw Valley?
Adele told me he was here.
Ocean is with him.
Heaven knows how many other ex-Army pals.
Foster, Ocean and Bergdorf.
All 82nd Airborne.
Maybe it's the anniversary of one of their commando raids.
The Little Scorpions.
It's all very mysterious.
What are you doing?
It ain't mysterious.
Hello, operator.
- Yes, sir?
- Cancel all the calls I put in.
No wonder I couldn't find out nothing.
A work of art.
- What are you so excited about?
- This.
- The robbery?
- Yeah.
You had anything to do with this?
No, I'm clean. But I know who pulled that job.
- You do?
- Yeah.
- Shouldn't you tell the police?
- Oh, no!
You wanna know why not?
Because I love you too much.
May I learn what's so amusing?
Your Jimmy, your innocent.
- I knew he had guts when I met him.
- Please, Duke.
This job was cooked up by Jimmy and his soldier pals.
Jimmy has all the money he could spend. Why would he rob anyone?
Hitler had Europe.
Why'd he want Russia?
You can't compare Jimmy with him.
He fought Hitler.
He and his paratroopers overran Germany.
Last night they overrun Las Vegas.
It's a shame that boy wasn't born poor.
- What a career he could've had.
- You're serious.
They hijacked the town.
Jimmy and his paratroopers.
This won't take long.
See you at lunch.
- Want some lunch?
- Go ahead. I may not eat for weeks.
Hello, Danny.
Hey, nice room you got here.
- I don't know your friend.
- You don't know me.
Sure I do.
I'm a pal of Jimmy Foster's.
I know some of your other buddies too.
Like Tony Bergdorf.
Poor Tony died, you know.
It's too bad. His wife's coming over to claim his body.
Yeah, Tony's going home in a pine box.
It's a beautiful job you boys pulled.
A real work of art.
- You a cop?
- Me? Duke Santos, a cop?
I only wish I was in on it with you.
I envy you, your youth.
You're not getting younger.
What do you want?
Pros, I would've put out of business.
But new talent needs encouraging.
I want half.
- Half of what?
- You tell me. You got the money.
You're talking to a dead phone.
There's a live one at the sheriff's office.
So you are a cop?
I made a deal with the casino owners to get their money back.
You're ready to double-cross them?
They were only gonna pay me
30 percent. You'll give me 50.
- Playing both ends from the middle.
- I can't lose.
You've already lost.
The money's sent out of town.
If you're here, the money's here.
We couldn't make a deal with you.
- Too many people involved.
- Talk to them.
That's gonna take a little time.
I'll give you till tomorrow.
I know you won't try anything cute.
50 percent is better than 100 of nothing.
One o'clock tomorrow, here.
Bye-bye.
Hold it.
What's your relationship to Jimmy?
I'm gonna marry his mama.
Jimmy sold us out.
Your best friend sold us out.
You believe that?
Want the facts tattooed on your nose?
Now we found out he's turned canary...
...you gotta stand up for the slob.
- Always on the opposite side.
- You jump to conclusions.
What will the others jump to?
Does Jimmy know where we hid the money?
- He does.
- Why doesn't he tell Santos...
...pick it up and split it with him?
- Go ahead. Right on the chin.
- Forget about it.
I've been making mistakes myself.
Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy!
I came as quickly as I could.
Are you ill?
You fool! You complete utter ass!
- Good, you're not ill.
- I could slap you.
Mother's Day? Did I forget?
You dare to be sarcastic after what you've done? No, it's not.
How do you plan to celebrate
Mother's Day? Rob Fort Knox?
After stealing all the money in Las Vegas, that's the next step.
Amazed? You probably thought you'd committed the perfect crime.
- You moron, I could die.
- Who's been talking to you?
- Duke, he knows all about it.
- That's impossible!
- Why would you believe what he says?
- Because he's a professional.
Don't try to lie.
Your face gives you away.
- As a liar, you're an amateur.
- Where's Santos?
He's going to take the money away from them.
Now he's gonna get mixed up in this too.
Oh, Jimmy, how could you treat me this way?
Now's a nice time to tell him.
I apologize. I thought you blew the whistle on us.
But Clarence Darrow here, he proved otherwise.
What do we do now that Santos knows?
Wish I knew.
We haven't got much time left.
I got an idea.
I'll paint you a picture on the way out. Come on, Clarence.
What's so funny?
I knew this color would come in handy.
- Oh, Josh.
- Yeah?
- How do you get this stuff off?
- What I usually...
You can count it in San Francisco.
It's for Tony's widow.
It's only 10 grand.
Good boy. I should've thought of that myself.
- Operation Pine Box.
- Danny? The widow just arrived.
I figure she'll ship the body on the 11:40.
It's the only train today.
They got time.
You stay with her.
We'll phone the others.
- Operator?
- Operator, get me Dudley 26969.
- Vince Massler.
- Vince, watch the 11:40.
Tony may go out on it.
Mr. Santos will get his.
Sorry to keep you. I'm Mr. Cohen.
I came to make arrangements to ship my husband's body.
Yes. Mrs. Bergdorf, may l...?
May I ask, Mrs. Bergdorf, in my professional capacity...
...are you a woman of means?
Oh, no.
No, my late husband left me $ 10,000.
I received it this morning.
I'd like to keep that for my son's education.
I understand.
If I may make a suggestion,
Mrs. Bergdorf?
Of course.
The services in Las Vegas are no different from San Francisco.
Your husband was a war hero.
And we have the American Legion here.

Why waste money on needless transportation?
- I guess you're right, Mr. Cohen.
- Good. Good.
- Danny?
- Corneal?
Something's going on,
but I don 't know what.
- The box hasn't left?
- I don't think it's going to.

- A bunch of legionnaires showed up.
They're gonna attend the services.
The widow's gonna plant Tony here in Vegas.
Wait there. I'll round up the boys.
We'll be over.
- Who is it?
- Kelly of Kelly and Cohen Morticians.
You asked me to call you if something unusual happened.
Bergdorf? Yeah, go ahead.
A dozen men arrived to attend the services...
...held in our chapel which serves all denominations and faiths.
Skip the commercial, will you?
These men don't look like usual mourners.
There's something else.
I made an unusual discovery
in the waiting chapel.
I could call it incredible.
Mr. Santos, I will call it incredible.
- What is it?
- A money band. A $ 10,000 money band.
Lying by the coffin.
It wasn't there last night.
- By the coffin?
- Right beside it.
I hardly know what to think.
I do. I'll be right over.
How do you like that?
A dead delivery boy!
We are gathered together today to pay tribute...
...to the memory of
Anthony Raymond Bergdorf.
At such a time it is fitting that we recall the psalm of David.
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He leadeth me besides still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
...I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.
Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all..."
- What's that noise?
- What's that noise?
"...the Lord forever."
What's that noise?
The deceased is being cremated.
"Verily, verily, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes...
...dust to dust.
In sure and certain hope of the resurrection unto eternal life.
The Lord lift up His face upon you...
...and give you peace.
This day and always.
Amen."

To many of you, this building has become endeared by many sacred memories, and you will suffer a loss and feel that something has passed out of your lives.
Such persons will be comforted by the assurance that the presence of God and the consolation of our holy religion are not tied to any one building.
We have caused that the altar hitherto in this church should be carefully removed and protected from desecration.

Had a dinner that couldn't be beat,
and ended up
with an amazing pile of garbage.
And we decided
it would be a friendly gesture
for us to take the garbage
down to the town dump.
So we took the half a ton of garbage and
put it in the back of a red VW Microbus,
took shovels and rakes
and other implements of destruction,
and we headed off toward the town dump.
(bell tolls)
But when we got to the town dump...
We had never heard of a dump
closed on Thanksgiving before.
And with tears in our eyes, we drove off to
look for another place to put the garbage.
We didn't find one
until we came to a side road,
and off on the side of the side road
was a 15-foot cliff.
At the bottom was
another pile of garbage,
and we decided that one big pile
was better than two little ones.
Rather than bring that one up,
we decided to throw ours down.
That's what we did.
And then we drove off into the sunset.
Sure was nice of you to cook that delicious Thanksgiving feastie.
It was sure was nice of you to dump all that garbage.
- You're both nice, but what's for dinner?
- Oh, you...
(phone rings)
Hello?
Yeah, just a minute.
- Who is it?
- Officer Obie.
Hello.
We found your name on an envelope under half a ton of garbage.
Do you have any information about it?
Yes, sir, Officer Obie. I cannot tell a lie.
I put that envelope under that garbage.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
After speaking to Obie
for about 45 minutes on the telephone,
we finally arrived
at the truth of the matter.
Yup. All right.
He said we had to go down
and pick up the garbage,
and also had to go down and speak to him
at the police officer station.
Now, friends, there was only one or
two things Officer Obie could have done.
Maybe he'll give us a medal for being so brave and honest.
I think he'll probably just bawl us out or somethin'.
But at the police officer station,
there was a third possibility
that we hadn't even counted upon.
You're both under arrest.
Wait. We can't pick up the garbage with these handcuffs on.
Shut up and get in the back of the patrol car.
So we sat in the back of the patrol car
and drove to the "scene of the crime".
Let me tell you about Stockbridge,
Massachusetts, where this happened.
They got three "Stop" signs,
two police officers, and one police car.
But at the scene of the crime there was
five police officers and three police cars,
bein' the biggest crime
of the last 50 years,
and everybody wanted to get in
the newspaper story about it.
And they was usin'
all kinds of cop equipment
they had hangin' around
the police officer station.
They was takin'plaster tyre tracks,
footprints, dog smellin' prints,
and they took 27 eight-by-ten
coloured glossy photographs
with circles and arrows
and a paragraph on the back of each one
explainin' what each one was,
to be used as evidence against us.
Pictures of the approach, the getaway, the
southwest corner, the northwest corner.
And that's not to mention
the aerial photography.
(howls)
Alice!
- Save us!
- To the rescue!
Hey, now wait a minute.
Hold it! Hold it, Obie!
I said hold it. Where the hell...?
- Let go of my arm.
- Take off those handcuffs.
- You're interfering in my civic duty.
- You meathead.
Haven't you played cop enough for today?
This side is reserved for officers of the law and criminals.
- You pig-eyed idiot!
- I've had enough garbage today.
- Yours and theirs!
- Stupid bastard! Cradle-hopper!
- Turkey-raper!
- Badmouthing me won't get them off.
- Just pay the bail!
- Bail?!
Yes, bail.
I want your wallets and your belts.
Put everything on the desk.
I understand you wanting our wallets so we can't spend money, but what do you want our belts for?
Kid, we don't want any hangin'.
Do you think we'd hang ourselves for litterin'?
What do you want now, Obie? Our teeth?
Obie said he was makin' sure
and, friends, Obie was.
He took the toilet seat so we couldn't
hit ourselves on the head and drown,
and he took the toilet paper
so we couldn't bend the bars,
roll the paper out the window, slide down
and have an escape and get away.
Obie was makin' sure.
Hey, when do we get our bread and water?
Shut up, kid.
I got the bail release. Let 'em out.
(mouths)
Come to mama, baby.
You may bring the bags out now.
(cheering)
- We're free!
- Hey, man.
We want a little respect for law and order.
An injustice!
You're the only one I dreamed of the whole time I was in.
- Come on, man.
- No. I can't stand the smell of cop toilets.
- Hell, I'll wait out here with ya.
- Will you just leave me alone?
OK.
OK... baby.
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.
All persons having anything to do before the honourable justice of the district court, James E Hannon, now sitting at Lee, within and for the county of Berkshire, draw near, give your attendance, and you shall be heard.
God save the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
(clerk) You may be seated.
Roger Crowther and Arlo Guthrie, you will stand and face the court.
You are charged with illegal disposal of garbage.
- How do you plead?
- We cannot tell a lie.
Your Honour, we're guilty.
I sentence each of you to pay a fine of 25 dollars, and you will remove the garbage.
And Obie looked at the seeing-eye dog,
then at the coloured glossy photographs
with circles and arrows and a paragraph
on the back, and began to cry,
cos he came to the realisation that it was
a typical case of American blind justice,
and there wasn't nothin'
he could do about it.
Now that we've paid our debt to society, what do we do with the evidence?
I don't give a damn, long as you don't dump it around here.
I'm gonna escort you to the town line.
Now, get goin'.
- Gotta pick up my chick.
- That figures.
Hey, come on. I'm gettin' rid out of town, and I told 'em I had to pick up my girl.
- Am I your girl?
- I guess you'd better be.
(speaks Japanese)
- What'd he say?
- He said he'd glaze my pot.
That's what I thought.
With all this garbage?
Why can't we take it to the town dump?
I told you, he's ridin' us outta town.
- Sure does look that way.
- Where can we dump it, then?
I think I know.
New York's a nice place to visit,
but I wouldn't wanna...
(ship's hooter)
♪ Hawaiian guitar)
OK to come up?
Sure.
Looks like this letter's been followin' you around some.
- What day is today?
- The 8th.
- Then my army physical is tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
It's 8 am, Whitehall Street.
You just might be selected to defend our country.
Yeah.
That's weird. (laughs)
They'll never take anyone as crazy as you.
They got a building in New York called
Whitehall Street where you get injected,
inspected, detected,
infected, neglected and selected.
Hey, kid. Where's your papers we sent you through the mail?
- Didn't say anything on it to bring it.
- All right. What's your name?
And I proceeded on down the hall, gettin'
more injections, inspections, infections,
neglections and all kinds of stuff
they were doin' to me there,
and I was there for two hours,
three hours, four hours...
I was there a long time goin' through
all kinds of mean, nasty things
and havin' a tough time, and they was
inspectin', injectin' every part of me.
And they was leavin' no parts untouched.
Turn your head and cough.
Turn your head and cough.
Turn your head and cough.
Turn your hat and cough.
Turn your head and cough.
- That ain't enough.
- It's all I had.
- Ain't enough. Do some more.
- But...
That's an order.
Hey, anybody got any to spare?
And I proceeded on through and
finally came to see the very last man.
I walked in, said "What do you
want to see me about?" He said:
See the shrink.
Come in, my boy.
I went up there, I said
"Shrink, I wanna kill. I wanna kill. "
"I wanna see blood and gore and guts,
veins in my teeth, eat dead burnt bodies. "
And I started jumpin' up and down
yellin' "Kill! Kill!"
And he started jumpin' up and down
with me, and we was both yellin':
Kill! Kill! Kill!
You're our boy! Right this way.
We only got one question: have you ever been arrested?
And I proceeded to tell him the story
of the Alice's Restaurant Massacree,
with full orchestration, five-part harmony,
stuff like that, other phenomena.
He stopped me. He said:
Kid, have you ever been in court?
And I proceeded to tell him the story
of the 27 eight-by-ten glossy pictures
with circles and arrows and a paragraph
explaining what each one meant.
He stopped me again. He said:
Kid, I want you to go in there and sit down on the bench that says "Group W".
And I walked... walked over
to the bench there, and there's...
Group Wis where they put you if you may
not be moral enough to join the army
after committin' your special crime.
And there was all kinds of mean, nasty,
ugly-lookin'people on the bench there.
There was mother-rapers,
father-stabbers,
father-rapers...
Father-rapers, sittin' on the bench
next to me, and they was mean and ugly
and horrible and crime-fightin' guys
sittin' there next to me.
And the meanest, ugliest,
nastiest father-raper of them all,
I mean, he was mean and nasty
and ugly and horrible, and he said:
- What'd you get?
- Nothin'.
I had to pay 50 dollars and pick up the garbage.
- What were you arrested for, kid?
- Uh...
Litterin'.
And creatin' a nuisance.
- How long you been out?
- A few hours.
We had a great time on the bench
talkin' about crime,
mother-stabbin', father-rapin',
all kinds of groovy stuff, until...
Ten-shun!
(gabbles)
I want you writing it down with these pencils and paper I'm gonna give you.
Pass these forms out. Here's the pencil.
When you finish, hand 'em back to me.
And he talked for 45 minutes, and
nobody understood a word that he said.
But we had fun fillin' out the forms
and playin' with the pencils,
and I turned over the piece of paper,
and there on the other side...
read the followin' words:
Kid, have you rehabilitated yourself?.
Sergeant, you've got a lotta goddamn gall to ask if I've rehabilitated myself.
I mean... I mean,
I'm sittin' here on the Group W bench cos you wanna know if I'm moral enough to join the army, burn women, kids, houses and villages after bein' a litterbug!
Kid, we don't like your kind! We're gonna send your fingerprints off to Washington!
- (Roger) Hey, what happened?
- I'm free, man! I'm free!
- Let's get up to the church.
- Sorry, man, I gotta go see Woody.
I don't know what I'd have done if they'd taken me.
Maybe... maybe I wouldn't have had the guts to go to jail.
Yeah.
I could have done that.
It's weird.
Good things in my life always seem to... come out of not doin' what I don't wanna do.
Now that they're not after me to do what I don't wanna do, what do I wanna do?
It may take me some hard travellin' to find that out for my own self.

Wanna get the cuffs off?.
If he busts up the town again, I'll bust him.
I got the whole book on him - possession, pushing, the whole rap - so keep him down here where he belongs.
(laughs) I put my nut act on for Obie when he stopped the car.
I made him forget all about lockin' me up.
I knew they'd bring me back here.
Alice, can I have a Coke?
Where'd you get it?
- Get what?
- The big fix you're flyin' on.
- Where'd you get it?!
- I'm off, remember?
Absolutely off.
Absolutely off. I kicked it. I beat it.
Please. Please, baby, don't get back on.

Ray, no! Don't!

Where do you keep it?
Huh?!
Yeah.

It's not junk! It's not junk!

- It might help him.

One big muscle!
- He needs taking care of!
- So do you!
- Cool it.
- You wanna cool it, buddy.
- Where the hell are we, anyway?
- I'm in my church. Where are you?
- If you read it like that.
- That's the way I read it.

Shelly! Shelly!
Hey, there's Roger and your bus.
- Hi, Arlo. How was Woody at the end?
- I don't know. I wasn't around.
- Not now.
- I can't tell you how sorry we all are.
No, not now. Please, not now.
I'm sorry I didn't make it, Mother.
I guess I shoulda hung around.
That's all right, baby.
You couldn't have known.
Surprised me, too.
- 15 years...
- Marjorie?
All his friends wanna know.
When's the funeral?
There's not going to be one.
Woody didn't want a funeral. No funeral.
When we're all together, we'll take his ashes out to Coney Island.
Here I'd missed seein' Woody
one more time,
and Shelly was buried
before I ever made it back up there.

Perhaps we should have put a cowbell around her neck.
Have you tried the barn?
You know how much she adores the animals.
I have looked everywhere, in all of the usual places.
Sister Bernice, considering that it's Maria...
I suggest you look in someplace unusual.
Well, Reverend Mother, I hope this new infraction... ends whatever doubts you may still have about Maria's future here.

You may go in now, Maria.
Come here, my child.
- Now, sit down.
- Oh!
Oh, Reverend Mother, I'm so sorry.
I just couldn't help myself.
The gates were open, and the hills were beckoning, and before I-
Dear, I haven't summoned you here for apologies.
Oh, please, Mother, do let me ask for forgiveness.
If it would make you feel better.
Yes. Well, you see, the sky was so blue today... and everything was so green and fragrant.
I just had to be a part of it.
And the Untersberg kept leading me higher and higher... as though it wanted me to go right through the clouds with it.
Child, suppose darkness had come and you were lost?
Oh, Mother, I could never be lost up there.
That's my mountain. I was brought up on it.
It was the mountain that led me to you.
Oh?
When I was a child,
I would come down the mountain... and climb a tree and look over into your garden.
I'd see the sisters at work, and I'd hear them sing on their way to vespers... which brings me to another transgression,
Reverend Mother.
I was singing out there today without permission.
Maria, it is only here in the abbey that we have rules about postulants singing.
I can't seem to stop singing wherever I am.
And what's worse, I can't seem to stop saying things- everything and anything I think and feel.
Some people would call that honesty.
But it's terrible, Reverend Mother.
You know how Sister Berthe always makes me kiss the floor after we've had a disagreement?
Lately I've taken to kissing the floor when I see her coming just to save time.
Maria, when you saw us over the abbey wall... and longed to be one of us... that didn't necessarily mean... that you were prepared for the way we live here, did it?
No, Mother, but I- I pray, and I try... and I am learning, I really am.
What is the most important lesson you have learned here, my child?
To find out what is the will of God and to do it wholeheartedly.
Maria.
It seems to be the will of God that you leave us.
- Leave?
- Only for a while, Maria.
Oh, no, Mother, please don't do that.
Don't send me away.
This is where I belong. It’s my home, my family.
It’s my life.
- But are you truly ready for it?
- Yes, I am.
Perhaps if you go out into the world for a time... knowing what we expect of you... you will have a chance to find out if you can expect it of yourself.
I know what you expect, Mother, and I can do it.
- I promise I can.
- Maria.
Yes, Mother.
If it is God's will.
There is a family near Salzburg... that needs a governess until September.
- Until September?
- To take care of seven children.
- Seven children!
- Do you like children, Maria?
Well, yes, but seven!
I will tell Captain von Trapp to expect you tomorrow.
Uh, Captain?
A retired officer of the Imperial Navy.
A fine man and a brave one.
Ηis wife died several years ago, leaving him alone with the children.
I understand he's had a most difficult time... managing to keep a governess there.
Uh, why difficult, Reverend Mother?
The Lord will show you in his own good time.

[ Doorbell Rings ]
Oh! Whew!
Ηello! Ηere I am.
I'm from the convent. I'm the new governess, Captain.
And I'm the old butler, fraülein.
Oh. Well, how do you do?
Ηmm.
You'll, uh, wait here, please.
[ Door Opens ]
In the future, you'll kindly remember... there are certain rooms in this house which are not to be disturbed.
Yes, Captain, sir.
And why do you stare at me that way?
Well, you don't look at all like a sea captain, sir.
I'm afraid you don't look very much like a governess.
- Turn around, please.
- What?
Turn.
Ηat off.
[ Sighs ]
It’s the dress.
You'll have to put on another one before you meet the children.
But I don't have another one.
When we enter the abbey, our worldly clothes were given to the poor.
What about this one?
- The poor didn't want this one.
- Hmm.
I would have made myself a new dress, but there wasn't time.
I can make my own clothes.
Well, I'll see that you get some material.
Today, if possible.
- Now, Fraülein, um-
- Maria.
Fraülein Maria, I don't know how much the mother abbess has told you.
- Not much.
- You are the 12th in a long line of governesses... who have come to look after my children since their mother died.
I trust that you will be an improvement on the last one. She stayed only two hours.
What's wrong with the children, sir?
There's nothing wrong with the children, only the governesses.
Oh.
They were completely unable to maintain discipline.
Without it, this house cannot be properly run.
- You will please remember that, fraülein?
- Yes, sir.
Every morning you will drill the children in their studies.
I will not permit them to dream away their summer holidays.
Each afternoon they will march about the grounds, breathing deeply.
Bedtime is to be strictly observed, no exceptions.
Excuse me, sir. When do they play?
You will see to it that they conduct themselves at all time... with the utmost orderliness and decorum.
- I'm placing you in command.
- Oh, yes, sir!
[ Whistle Blows ]
[ Running Footsteps ]
[ Whistle Blows ]
[ Whistle Blows Rhythmically ]
[ Whistle Continues Blowing Rhythmically ]
[ Whistle Blows Twice ]
Hup.
Now, this is your new governess, Fraülein Maria.
As I sound your signals, you will step forward and give your name.
You, fraülein, will listen carefully.
- Learn their signals so you can call them when you want them.
- [ Blows Three Times ]
- Liesl.
- [ Whistle Blows Twice ]
- Friedrich.
- [ Blows Three Times ]
- Louisa.
- [ Blows Once ]
- Κurt.
- [ Blows Four Times ]

- [ Blows Four Times ]

- [ Blows Six Times ]
[ Whistle Blows Louder ]
And Gretl.
[ Clears Throat ]
Now, let's see how well you listened.
Oh, I-I won't need to whistle for them,
Reverend Captain.
I mean, um, I'll use their names.
And such lovely names.
[ Von Trapp ]
Fraülein, this is a large house.
The grounds are very extensive, and I will not have anyone shouting.
You will take this, please.
Learn to use it. The children will help you.
Now, when I want you, this is what you will hear.
- [ Sharp Whistling ]
- No, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
I could never answer to a whistle.
Whistles are for dogs and cats and other animals, but not for children... and definitely not for me.
It would be too humiliating.
Fraülein... were you this much trouble at the abbey?
- Oh, much more, sir.
- Hmm.
[ Whistle Blows ]
Excuse me, sir. I don't know your signal.
You may call me Captain.
[ Children Chuckling ]
[ Sighs ]
At ease.
Well, now that there's just us... would you please tell me all your names again and how old you are?
I'm Liesl. I'm 16 years old, and I don't need a governess.
I'm glad you told me, Liesl.
We'll just be good friends.
I'm Friedrich. I'm 14. I'm impossible.
[ Chuckles ]
Really? Who told you that, Friedrich?
Fraülein Josephine, four governesses ago.
I'm Brigitta.
You, um, didn't tell me how old you are, Louisa.
I'm Brigitta. She's Louisa.
She's 13 years old, and you're smart.
I'm 10, and I think your dress is the ugliest one I ever saw.
Brigitta, you shouldn't say that.
Why not? Don't you think it's ugly?
Of course, but Fraülein Hilda's was ugliest.
I'm Kurt. I'm 11. I'm incorrigible.
Congratulations.
What's "incorrigible"?
I think it means you want to be treated like a boy.
Mm-hmm?
I'm Marta, and I'm gonna be seven on Tuesday.
And I'd like a pink parasol.
Well, pink's my favorite color too.
- [ Stomping ]
- Yes, you're Gretl.
And you're five years old?
My, you're practically a lady.
[ Girls Chuckle ]
Now I have to tell you a secret-
I've never been a governess before.
You mean you don't know anything about being a governess?
Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.
Well, the best way to start... is to be sure to tell Father to mind his own business.
- You must never come to dinner on time.
- Uh-
- Never eat your soup quietly.
- [ Slurps ]
And during dessert, always blow your nose.
Don't you believe a word they say, Fraülein Maria.
- Why not?
- Because I like you!
- Yes.
- [ Clapping ]
All right now, children!
Outside for your walk. Father's orders.
Now, hurry up, hurry up.
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!
- Uh, Fraülein Maria.
- Mmm.
- I'm Frau Schmidt, the housekeeper.
- How do you do?
How do you do? I'll show you to your room. Follow me.
[ Maria ]
Poor little dears.
[ Gasps, Screaming ]
- Oh!
- You're very lucky.
- With Fraülein Helga, it was a snake.
- [ Exhales ]
Good evening.
- Good evening, children.
- Good evening, Fraülein Maria.
[ Screams, Laughing ]
- [ Groans ]
- Enchanting little ritual.
Something you, um, learned at the abbey?
No, um, it's, um- um-
[ Patting ] rheumatism.
Ηmm.
Excuse me, Captain.
Haven't we forgotten to thank the Lord?
For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.
- Amen.
- [ Children ] Amen.
I'd like to thank each and every one of you for the precious gift... you left in my pocket earlier today.
Um, what gift?
It’s meant to be a secret, Captain, between the children and me.
Uh-huh. Then I suggest that you keep it and let us eat.
Knowing how nervous I must have been... a stranger in a new household... knowing how important it was for me to feel accepted... it was so kind and thoughtful of you... to make my first moments here so warm... and happy and pleasant.
[ Cries ]
- What is the matter, Marta?
- Nothing.
[ Children Crying ]
[ Von Trapp ]
Fraülein.
Is it to be at every meal, or merely at dinnertime... that you intend leading us all through this rare... and wonderful new world of indigestion?
Oh, they're all right, Captain. They're just happy.
[ Crying Louder ]
[ Doorbell Rings ]
- Rolfe, good evening.
- Good evening, Franz.
- I trust everything is under control?
- Yes. Yes.
Good.
- Are there, uh, any developments?
- Perhaps.
- Is the captain at home?
- He's at dinner.
- With the family?
- Yes.
Please give him this telegram at once.
Certainly.
- A telegram for you, sir.
- Mmm.
Franz, who delivered it?
That young lad Rolfe, of course.
- Father, may I be excused?
- Hmm. Children.
In the morning, I shall be going to Vienna.
[ All ]
Not again, Father!
How long will you be gone this time, Father?
I'm not sure, Gretl. Not sure.
[ Louisa ]
To visit Baroness Schraeder again?
Mind your own business!
As a matter of fact, yes, Louisa.
Why can't we ever get to see the baroness?
[ Kurt ]
Why would she want to see you?
It just so happens, Marta, that you are going to see the baroness.
I'm bringing her back with me to visit us all.
[ Children ]
Good!
And Uncle Max.
- Uncle Max!
- Uncle Max!
Rolfe!
Oh, Rolfe.
- No, Liesl, we mustn't.
- Why not, silly?
- I don't know. It’s just-
- Isn’t this why you're here waiting for me?
Yes, of course. I've missed you, Liesl.
You have? How much?
So much that I even thought of sending you a telegram... just so I'd be able to deliver it here.
Oh, that's a lovely thought. Why don't you, right now?
But I'm here.
Please, Rolfe, send me a telegram.
I'll start it for you. Dear Liesl-
Dear Liesl.
I'd like to be able to tell you how I feel about you. Stop.
Unfortunately, this wire is already too expensive.
- Sincerely, Rolfe.
- "Sincerely"?
- Cordially.
- "Cordially"?
Affectionately?
Mmm!
Will there be any reply?
Dear Rolfe. Stop.
Don't stop. Your Liesl.
If only we didn't always have to wait... for someone to send Father a telegram.
Ηow do I know when I'll see you again?
Well, let's see.
I could come here by mistake... with a telegram for Colonel Schneider.
He's here from Berlin, staying with-
No one's supposed to know he's here.
- Don't tell your father, now.
- Why not?
- Well, your father's so- so Austrian.
- We're all Austrian.
Well, some people think we ought to be German... and they're very mad at those who don't think so.
They're getting ready to-
Well, let's hope your father doesn't get into trouble.
Don't worry about Father. He's a big naval hero.
- He was even decorated by the emperor.
- I know.
I don't worry about him, but I do worry about his daughter.
Me? Why?
- Well, you're so-
- What?
You're such a baby!
I'm 16. What's such a baby about that?

[ Thunder Rumbling ]
Whee!
[ Thunderclaps ]
- [ Knocking ]
- Come in.
Frau Schmidt.
For your new dresses, Fraülein Maria.
The captain had these sent out from town.
Oh, how lovely.
I'm sure these will make the prettiest clothes I've ever had.
Tell me, do you think the captain would get me some more material if I asked him?
- Ηow many dresses does a governess need?
- [ Window Bangs ]
No, not for me. For the children.
I want to make them some play clothes.
The von Trapp children don't play. They march.
Surely, you don't approve of that.
Ever since the captain lost his poor wife... he- he runs this house as if he were on one of his ships again.
Whistles, orders.
No more music, no more laughing.
Nothing that reminds him of her.
- Even the children.
- But it's so wrong!
Oh, well. How do you like your room?
- There'll be new drapes at the windows.
- Mmm.
New drapes? But these are fine.
Nevertheless, new ones have been ordered.
Oh, but I really don't need them.
- Good night now.
- Frau Schmidt.
Do you think if I asked the captain tomorrow about the material-
He's leaving for Vienna in the morning.
Oh, yes, of course. Well, how long will he be gone?
That all depends.
The last time he visited the baroness, he stayed for a month.
Oh.
I shouldn't be saying this- not to you.
I mean, I don't know you that well.
But if you ask me, the captain's thinking very seriously... of marrying the woman before the summer's over.
Oh, that would be wonderful.
The children will have a mother again.
Yes. Well, good night.
- Good night.
- [ Thunder Rumbling ]
[ Thunderclap, Rain Falling ]
Dear Father, now I know why you've sent me here.
To help these children prepare themselves for a new mother.
And I pray that this will become a happy family in thy sight.
God bless the captain. God bless Liesl and Friedrich.
God bless Louisa, Brigitta, Marta and little Gretl.
And, oh, I forgot the other boy. What's his name?
Well, God bless what's-his-name.
God bless the reverend mother and Sister Margaretta... and everybody at Nonnberg Abbey.
And now, dear God, about Liesl-
Ηelp her to know that I'm her friend.
And help her to tell me what she's been up to.
- Are you going to tell on me?
- Shh.
Ηelp me to be understanding so that I may guide her footsteps.
In the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
I was out taking a walk, and somebody locked the doors earlier than usual... and I didn't want to wake everybody up.
So when I saw your window open-
You're not going to tell Father, are you?
Ηmm.
Ηow in the world did you climb up here?
It’s how we always got into this room to play tricks on the governess.
Louisa can make it with a whole jar of spiders in her hand.
Spiders?
Oh. Liesl.
Were you out walking all by yourself?
You know, if we wash that dress out tonight, nobody would notice it tomorrow.
You could put this on.
Take your dress in there.
Put it to soak in the bathtub.
Then come back here and sit on the bed, and we'll have a talk.
I told you today I didn't need a governess.
Well, maybe I do.
[ Thunderclap ]
Gretl? Are you scared?
[ Thunderclap ]
You're not frightened of a thunderstorm, are you?
You just stay right here with me. Oh!
- Where are the others?
- They're asleep. They're not scared.
[ Thunderclap ]
Oh, no? Look.
All right, everybody. Up here on the bed.
- [ Brigitta ] Really?
- Well, just this once. Come on.
Now, all we have to do is wait for the boys.
You won't see them. Boys are brave.
[ Thunderclap ]
Uh, you boys weren't scared too, were you?
Oh, no. We just wanted to be sure that you weren't.
- That's very thoughtful of you, Friedrich.
- It wasn't my idea.
It was Kurt's.
Kurt! That's the one I left out. God bless Kurt.
[ Thunderclap ]
Why does it do that?
Well, the lightning says something to the thunder, and the thunder answers back.
- The lightning must be nasty.
- Not really.
Then why does the thunder get so angry?
It makes me want to cry.
[ Thunderclap ]
Well, now, when anything bothers me and I'm feeling unhappy...
I just try and think of nice things.
[ Louisa, Marta ]
What kind of things?
Oh! Well, let me see. Nice things-
Daffodils!
Green meadows.
Skies full of stars.

Fraülein, did I not tell you that bedtime is to be strictly observed in this house?
The children were upset by the storm, so I thought that if I-
You did, sir.
And do you or do you not have difficulty remembering such simple instructions?
Only during thunderstorms, sir.
- [ Kurt Giggles ]
- Liesl?
- Yes, Father?
- I don't recall seeing you anywhere after dinner.
Oh, really? Well, as a matter of fact-
Yes?
Well, I- I was-
What she would like to say, Captain, is that she and I... have been getting better acquainted tonight.
But it's much too late now to go into all that.
Come along, children, you heard your father.
Go back to bed immediately.
Fraülein, you have managed to remember that I'm leaving in the morning?
Is it also possible that you remember... that the first rule in this house is discipline?
Then I trust that before I return, you will have acquired some?
Captain.
Uh, I wonder if, before you go...
I could talk to you about some clothes for the children, for when they play.
- Fraülein Maria.
- If I could just have some material-
You are obviously many things, not the least of which is repetitious.
- But they're children!
- Yes.
And I'm their father. Good night.

I can't understand how children as nice as you... can manage to play such awful tricks on people.

- But why do it?
- How else can we get Father's attention?
- Yes.

The mountains are magnificent, Georg, really magnificent.
I had them put up just for you, darling.
- Oh.
- Even if it's to a height of 10,000 feet...
Georg always believes in rising to the occasion.
Unless the jokes improve, Max,
I'm taking back my invitation.
You didn't invite me to your villa. I invited myself.
Naturally.
You needed a chaperone, and I needed a place to stay where the cuisine is superb... the wine cellar unexcelled and the price, uh, perfect.
[ Laughs ]
Max, you are outrageous!
Not at all. I'm a very charming sponge.

They're good.
Very good.
I must explore this territory in the next few days.
Somewhere a hungry little singing group is waiting for Max Detweiler... to pluck it out of obscurity and make it famous at the Salzburg Folk Festival.
They get the fame. You get the money.
'Tis unfair, I admit it.
But someday that'll be changed.
- I shall get the fame too.
- [ Laughs ]
[ Laughing, Screaming ]
[ Baroness ]
Good heavens, what's this?
Oh, it's nothing. Just some local urchins.
[ Children Laughing, Chattering, Whooping ]
[ Sighs ] This really is exciting for me, Georg, being here with you.
[ Laughs ] Trees, lakes, mountains- when you've seen one, you've seen them all.
That is not what I mean, and you know it.
Ah, you mean me. I'm exciting.
- Is that so impossible?
- No, just, uh, highly improbable.
- There you go, running yourself down again.
- Well, I'm a dangerous driver.
[ Laughs ]
You know, you're much less of a riddle when I see you here, Georg.
- In my natural habitat?
- Yes, exactly.
Are you trying to say that I'm more at home here... among the birds and the flowers... and the wind that moves through the trees like a restless sea, hmm?
Ηow poetic.
Yes, it was rather, wasn't it?
More at home here than in Vienna... in all your glittering salons... gossiping gaily with bores I detest, soaking myself in champagne... stumbling about to waltzes by Strauss
I can't even remember.
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- More or less, yes.
Now, whatever gave you that idea?
[ Sighs ]
Oh, I do like it here, Georg.
It’s so lovely and peaceful.
Ηow can you leave it as often as you do?
Oh, pretending to be madly active, I suppose.
Activity suggests a life filled with purpose.
Could it be running away from memories?
Mm-hmm.
Or perhaps just searching for a reason to stay.
Oh, I hope that's why you've been coming to Vienna so often.
Or were there other distractions there?
Oh, I'd hardly call you a mere distraction, darling.
Well, what would you call me, Georg?
Ηmm. Lovely.
Charming, witty, graceful. The perfect hostess.
And, uh- Υou're gonna hate me for this- in a way, my savior.
Oh, how unromantic.
I would be an ungrateful wretch if I didn't tell you at least once... that it was you who brought some meaning back into my life.
Oh, I am amusing, I suppose.
And I do have the finest couturier in Vienna... and the most glittering circle of friends.
- And I do give some rather gay parties.
- [ Laughs ] Yes.
But take all that away, and you have just... wealthy, unattached little me searching just like you.
[ Chuckles ]
More strudel, Herr Detweiler?
- Ηow many have I had?
- Two.
- Make it an uneven three.
- [ Chuckles ]
Still eating, Max, hmm? Tsk, tsk. Must be unhappy.
That marvelous mixed quartet I've been trying for months to steal away from Sol Hurok-
- What happened, darling?
- Yesterday, Sascha Petrie stole them first.
If there's one thing I hate, it's a thief.
Max, you really must try and learn to love yourself.
For this, I had to call Paris, Rome and Stockholm.
- On Georg's telephone, of course?
- How else could I afford it?
Oh, dear, I like rich people.
I like the way they live.
I like the way I live when I'm with them.
I wonder where the children are.
Obviously they must have heard
I was coming and went into hiding.
I was hoping they'd be here to welcome you.
Uh, Max, do step out of character for a moment and try and be charming.
[ Door Opens, Closes ]
Well?
Well what?
Have you made up Georg's mind yet?
Do I hear wedding bells?
- Pealing madly.
- Marvelous.
- But not necessarily for me.
- What kind of talk's that?
That is none-of-your-business talk, Max.
I'm terribly fond of Georg, and I will not have you toying with us.
But I'm a child. I like toys.
So tell me everything.
Oh, come on, tell Max every teensy weensy... intimate, disgusting detail.
Well, let's just say I have a feeling
I may be here on approval.
- Well, I approve of that. How can you miss?
- Far too easily.
If I know you, darling, and I do, you will find a way.
- Oh, he's no ordinary man.
- No. He's rich.
When his wife died, she left him with a terrible heartache.
And when your husband died, he left you with a terrible fortune.
Oh, Max, you really are a beast.
You and Georg are like family to me.
That's why I want to see you two get married.
We must keep all that lovely money in the family.
[ Chuckles ]
- What are you doing there?
- Captain von Trapp! I was just looking for-
I didn't see- I mean,
I didn't know you were- Heil Hitler!
Who are you?
I have a telegram for Herr Detweiler.
I'm Herr Detweiler.
Yes, sir.
All right, you've delivered your telegram. Now get out.
Oh, Georg, he's just a boy.
Yes, and I'm just an Austrian.
What's gonna happen's going to happen.
Just make sure it doesn't happen to you.
Max, don't you ever say that again!
You know I have no political convictions.
Can I help it if other people do?
Oh, yes, you can help it! You must help it.
Ηello.
You're far away. Where are you?
In a world that's disappearing, I'm afraid.
Is there any way I could bring you back to the world I'm in?

Immediately!
Fraülein, you will stay here, please.
I, uh- [ Clears Throat ]
I think I'd better go see what Max is up to.
Now, fraülein...
I want a truthful answer from you.
Yes, Captain?
Is it possible- or could I have just imagined it-
Ηave my children, by any chance, been climbing trees today?
- Yes, Captain.
- I see.
And where, may I ask, did they get these-
- Play clothes.
- Is that what you call them?
I made them from the drapes that used to hang in my bedroom.
- Drapes?
- They still had plenty of wear left.
The children have been everywhere in them.
Do you mean to tell me that my children... have been roaming about Salzburg... dressed up in nothing but some old drapes?
- Mm-hmm, and having a marvelous time.
- They have uniforms.
- Straitjackets, if you'll forgive me.
- I will not forgive you for that.
Children cannot do the things they're supposed to do... if they have to worry about spoiling their precious clothes.
- I haven't heard them complain yet.
- They wouldn't dare.
They love you too much. They fear you too much.
I don't wish you to discuss my children in this manner.
You've got to hear from someone.
You're never home long enough-
I said I don't want to hear any more from you-
I know you don't, but you've got to!
- Now, take Liesl-
- You'll not say one word about Liesl.
You're gonna wake up and find she's a woman.
You won't even know her.
Friedrich wants to be a man like you, and there's no one to show him how.
Don't you dare tell me about my son.
Brigitta could tell you about him, if you'd let her get close to you.
She notices everything.
Kurt pretends he's tough not to show how hurt he is when you brush him aside.
- That will do.
- The way you do all of them.
- Louisa, I don't know about, but someone has to find out.
- I said that will do!
And the little ones just want to be loved.
Oh, please, love them, love them all.
I don't care to hear anything further from you about my children!
- I am not finished yet, Captain!
- Oh, yes, you are, Captain-
Fraülein.
Now, you will pack your things this minute... and return to the abbey.

- The St. Ignatius Choir?
- Guess again.

- The Klopmann Choir?

- No, no?
- No, no.
- Oh.
- [ Liesl ] Tell us.

What a charming idea. Uh, whose family?
- [ Laughs ] Yours.
- Oh.
- Ah!
- They'll be the talk of the festival.

- What's so funny?
You are, Max. You're expensive, but very funny.
- But you heard them. They'll be a sensation!
- No, Max.

- The women look so beautiful.
- I think they look ugly.

- Nobody.

She has to join the party.
- No, really, I-
- Shh. Stop. Stop it.
- Georg, please.
- You can if you want to, fraülein.
I insist. You will be my dinner partner.
This is business.
Franz, set another place next to mine for Fraülein Maria.
Why- Whatever you say, Herr Detweiler.
It appears to be all arranged, doesn't it?
- It certainly does.
- I'm not suitably dressed.
Uh, well, you can change. We'll wait for you.
All right.
Captain, you must be very proud of your youngsters.
I am. Thank you, Baroness.
Is there a more beautiful expression... of what is good in this country of ours... than the innocent voices of our children?
Oh, come, now, Baron, would you have us believe... that Austria alone holds a monopoly on virtue?
Herr Zeller, some of us prefer
Austrian voices raised in song... to ugly German threats.
The ostrich buries his head in the sand... and sometimes... in the flag.
Perhaps those who would warn you that the Anschluss is coming- and it is coming, Captain- perhaps they would get further with you... by setting their words to music.
If the Nazis take over Austria, I have no doubt that you will be the entire trumpet section.
- You flatter me, Captain.
- Oh, how clumsy of me.
I meant to accuse you.
It’s very kind of you to offer to help me, Baroness.
I'm delighted, Maria.
I really don't think I do have anything that would be appropriate.
Now, where is that lovely little thing... you were wearing the other evening... when the captain couldn't keep his eyes off you?
Couldn't keep his eyes off me?
Come, my dear, we are women.
Let's not pretend we don't know when a man notices us.
- Here we are.
- The captain notices everybody and everything.
There's no need to feel so defensive, Maria.
You are quite attractive, you know.
The captain would hardly be a man if he didn't notice you.
Baroness, I hope you're joking.
- Not at all.
- But I've never done a thing to-
But you don't have to, my dear.
There's nothing more irresistible to a man than a woman who's in love with him.
- In love with him?
- Of course.
But what makes it so nice is he thinks he's in love with you.
But that's not true.
Surely you've noticed the way he looks into your eyes.
And, you know, uh, you blushed in his arms... when you were dancing just now.
Don't take it to heart.
He'll get over it soon enough, I should think.
Men do, you know.
Then I should go.
I mustn't stay here.
- Is there something I can do to help?
- No, nothing.
Yes.
Please don't say a word about this to the captain.
No. No, I wouldn't dream of it.
Good-bye, Maria.
I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun.
Champagne, darling.
I feel like celebrating.
Cheers.
- You know something?
- Perhaps.
Then if you're so clever, tell me how to get our little fraülein... to use her influence with Georg.
I want those children in the festival.
Elsa, this is important to Austria.
It wouldn't do you any harm either.
I've thought of that.
Well, if it's a matter of influence... maybe the one you'll have to be talking to is me.

Liesl, get the guitar. Come on, Marta.

You know your places in the group.
Get in your places. That's right.

That's lovely, lovely. Don't stop. Hmm?
- Uh, something long and cool, Georg?
- No, thank you, darling.
- Father?
- Yes, Brigitta?
Is it true Fraülein Maria isn't coming back?
Fraülein Maria? Yes, I suppose it's true.
What have we got here?
[ Baroness ]
Pink lemonade.
- Laced with, uh, lemonade.
- Ooh.
I don't believe it, Father.
Ηmm? Don't believe what, darling?
- About Fraülein Maria.
- Oh, Fraülein Maria!
Didn't I tell you what her note said?
Oh, I'm sure I did.
She said she missed her life at the abbey too much.
She had to leave us.
And that's all there is to it.
I think I'm brave enough to try some of that.
She didn't even say good-bye.
- She did in her note.
- [ Louisa ] That isn't the same thing.
Not too sweet, not too sour.
Just too, uh, pink.
- [ Gretl ] Father.
- Hmm?
Who is our new governess going to be?
Well.
You're not going to have a governess anymore.
- [ Children ] We're not?
- No.
You're going to have a new mother.
A new mother?
We talked about it last night.
It’s all settled, and we're all going to be very happy.
Hmm?
Well, all right, all right, all right.
Now, run off and play.
[ Doorbell Rings ]
Yes, my children?
- Uh, my name is Liesl.
- Yes, Liesl?
We- my brothers and sisters- we want to see Fraülein Maria.
Fraülein Maria?
Oh, Maria!
Come in, please.
Wait here.
I'm Sister Margaretta.
I understand you've been inquiring about Maria.
We have to see her.
Will you tell her we're here, please?
I'm afraid I can't do that.
- You've got to. We have to see her.
- She's our governess.
- We want her back!
- [ Kurt ] She didn't even say good-bye.
- It’s very important.
- All we want to do is talk to her.
I'm very sorry, children, but Maria is in seclusion.
She hasn't been seeing anyone.
- She'll see us. I know she will.
- I want to show her my finger.
Oh, some other time, dear.
I'll tell her that you were here.
It was sweet of you to call.
- [ Brigitta ] Oh, we have to speak to her!
- [ Marta ] Please!
- [ Children Clamoring ]
- Run along, children. Run along home.
- [ Friedrich ] Sister Margaretta!
- [ Girls ] Please! Please!
- Good-bye, children.
- Please. Please.
What was that about, Sister Margaretta?
The von Trapp children, Reverend Mother.
They want to see Maria.
Has she spoken yet? Has she told you anything?
She doesn't say a word,
Reverend Mother, except in prayer.
Poor child.
It’s strange. She seems happy to be back here... and yet- and yet she's unhappy too.
Perhaps I have been wrong in leaving her alone so long.
I think you'd better bring her to me, even if she's not yet ready.
Yes, Reverend Mother.
Sister Augusta, take our new postulant to the robing room.
God bless you, my daughter.
- [ Knocking ]
- Ave!
Yes, bring her in.
You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.
Reverend Mother.
Why did they send you back to us?
They didn't send me back, Mother. I left.
Sit down, Maria. Tell me what happened.
Well, I- I was frightened.
Frightened? Were they unkind to you?
Oh, no. No, I was- I was confused.
I- I felt-
I've never felt that way before. I couldn't stay.
I knew that here I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.
Maria, our abbey is not to be used as an escape.
What is it you can't face?
- I can't face him again.
- Him?
Thank you, Sister Margaretta.
Captain von Trapp?
- Are you in love with him?
- I don't know!
I don't know, I- The baroness said I was.
She- She said that he was in love with me... but I didn't want to believe it.
Oh, there were times when we would look at each other... oh, Mother, I could hardly breathe.
- Did you let him see how you felt?
- If I did, I didn't know it.
That's what's been torturing me.
I was there on God's errand.
To have asked for his love would have been wrong.
I couldn't stay. I just couldn't!
I'm ready at this moment to take my vows.
Please help me.
Maria, the love of a man and a woman is holy too.
You have a great capacity to love.
What you must find out is how God wants you to spend your love.
But I've pledged my life to God.
I- I've pledged my life to his service.
My daughter, if you love this man, it doesn't mean you love God less.
No.
You must find out.
You must go back.
Mother, you can't ask me to do that.
Please let me stay. I beg of you.
Maria, these walls were not built... to shut out problems.
You have to face them.
You have to live the life you were born to live.

Now, it's not like my children to be secretive.
[ Louisa ]
We're not being secretive, Father.
Mm-hmm. And it's not like my children to be late for dinner.
- We lost track of the time.
- Ah.
- [ Children ] Yes!
- I see.
Who's going to be the first one to tell me the truth?
Friedrich? Brigitta? Liesl?
Where do you think we were, Father?
Ηmm? Now-
Well, if you don't believe us, you must have some idea where you think we were.
- [ Giggling ]
- Aha! Marta!
- [ Marta ] Yes, Father.
- You tell me.
Friedrich told you, Father. We were berry picking.
I forgot. You were berry picking!
- [ Children ] Yeah! Yeah!
- All afternoon?
- We picked thousands of them.
- Thousands?
- [ Kurt ] I got the most.
- What kind of berries?
- Uh, blueberries, sir.
- Blueberries! Mmm!
[ Children ]
Yes! Yes, of course!
It’s, uh, too early for blueberries.
- They were strawberries.
- Strawberries?
It’s been so cold lately, they turned blue.
Aw!
[ Clicking Tongue ]
Very well. Show me the berries.
- [ Brigitta ] We-
- [ Louisa ] Well-
- Show me the berries you picked. Come on.
- We don't have them anymore.
You don't have them anymore?
Well, what happened to them?
- We- We-
- We ate them!
- You ate them?
- Yes!
- All of them?
- They were delicious!
Very well.
Since you've obviously stuffed yourselves... full of thousands of delicious berries, you can't be hungry anymore... so I'll just have to simply tell Frau Schmidt... to, uh, skip your dinner.
It’s all your fault! We should have told him the truth.
And made him boiling mad at us?
[ Kurt ]
It’s better than starving to death.
[ Louisa ] We didn't do anything wrong.
We just wanted to see her.
My stomach's making noises.
The least they could have done was to let us say hello.
I wonder what grass tastes like.
I feel awful.

- Oh, children, I'm so glad to see you!
- We missed you!
Oh, I missed you. Kurt, how are you?
Ηungry.
- Gretl, what happened to your finger?
- It got caught.
- Caught in what?
- Friedrich's teeth.
- Liesl, you all right?
- Just fair.
Many telegrams been delivered here lately?
None at all, fraülein, but I'm learning to accept it.
- I'll be glad when school begins.
- Oh, Liesl.
You can't use school to escape your problems.
You have to face them.
Oh, I have so much to tell you all.
- We have things to tell you too.
- I'm sure you do.
The most important thing is that Father is going to be married.
Married?
Yes, to Baroness Schraeder.
Oh, I see.
[ Brigitta ]
Oh, Father, look!
[ Friedrich ]
Fraülein Maria's come back from the abbey!
- Good evening, Captain.
- Good evening.
All right, everyone inside. Go and get your dinner.
[ Kurt ]
Dinner!
You left without saying good-bye... even to the children.
Well, it was wrong of me. Forgive me.
- Why did you?
- Please don't ask me.
Anyway, the reason no longer exists.
[ Baroness ]
Fraülein Maria.
You've returned.
Isn’t it wonderful, Georg?
May I wish you every happiness, Baroness, and you too, Captain.
The children tell me you're to be married.
Thank you, my dear.
You are back to, uh, stay?
Only until arrangements can be made for another governess.
[ Baroness ]
There you are!
I really must speak to cook about the wiener schnitzel.
It is entirely too delicious for my figure.
And it makes you much too quiet at the dinner table.
- Hmm.
- Or was it the wine?
Oh, undoubtedly the wine.
You have no idea what kind of trouble I'm having... trying to decide what to give you for a wedding present.
Oh, I know, I'm enough, but I do want you to have... some little trifle for the occasion.
At first, I thought of a fountain pen, but you've already got one.
And then I thought perhaps a villa in the south of France... but they are so difficult to gift-wrap.
Georg, how do you feel about yachts?
A long, sleek one for the Mediterranean... or a tiny one for your bathtub, hmm?
- Elsa.
- And where to go on our honeymoon?
Now, that is a real problem.
I thought a trip around the world would be lovely.
Then I said, "Oh, Elsa, there must be someplace better to go."
- Don't worry, darling. I-
- Elsa.
Yes, Georg?
It’s no use... you and I.
I'm being dishonest to both of us... and utterly unfair to you.
- When two people talk of marriage-
- No, don't.
Don't say another word, Georg, please.
You see, um-
There are other things I've been thinking of.
Fond as I am of you...
I really don't think you're the right man for me.
You're, um- You're much too independent.
And I- I need someone who needs me desperately... or at least needs my money desperately.
I've enjoyed every moment we've had together.
I do thank you for that.
Now, if you'll forgive me,
I'll go inside, pack my little bags... and return to Vienna, where I belong.
And somewhere out there is a young lady who I think... will never be a nun.
Auf Wiedersehen, darling.
[ Von Trapp ]
Hello.
I thought I just might find you here.
Was there something you wanted?
Hmm?
No, no, no, no. Sit down. Please.
Please.
Uh, may I?
[ Chuckles ]
You know, I was-
I was thinking and I was wondering two things.
Why did you run away to the abbey?
And... what was it that made you come back?
Well, I had an obligation to fulfill... and I- I came back to fulfill it.
Hmm. Is that all?
And I missed the children.
Yes. Only the children?
No. Yes! Isn’t it right I should have missed them?
Oh, yes! Yes, of course!
I was only hoping that perhaps you-
Perhaps you might, uh-
Yes?
Well, uh-
Nothing was the same when you were away... and it'll be all wrong again after you leave.
And I just thought perhaps you might, uh, change your mind?
I'm sure the baroness will be able to make things fine for you.
Maria.
There isn't going to be any baroness.
There isn't?
No.
I don't understand.
Well, we've, um, called off our engagement, you see, and-
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yes.
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.
- You did?
- Yes.
Well, you can't marry someone when you're... in love with someone else.
Can you?
[ Maria Sighs ]
The reverend mother always says...
"When the Lord closes a door, somewhere he opens a window."
What else does the reverend mother say?
That you have to look for your life.
Is that why you came back?
And have you found it...
Maria?
I think I have.
I know I have.
I love you.

Herr Detweiler!
- Heil Hitler.
- Oh. Good afternoon, Herr Zeller.
Perhaps you've not heard. I'm now the gauleiter.
- Heil Hitler.
- Uh, heil Hitler.
I have just come from the house of Captain von Trapp... incidentally, the only one in the neighborhood... not flying the flag of the Third Reich since the Anschluss.
- But we have dealt with that situation.
- I don't think-
The housekeeper told me that I would find you here.
It was the only information the woman would give me.
What kind of information are you looking for?
We want to know when the captain will be returning.
Well, he's on his honeymoon trip.
Uh, he's not been in touch with us.
Are you asking me to believe that the captain... has not communicated with his children in over a month?
Herr Zeller, how many men do you know... who communicate with their children while on their honeymoon?
When he does return, he will be expected to fill... his proper position in the new order.
Naturally, naturally. And may I congratulate you- that is, your people- on deciding to allow the festival to go on tonight as planned?
Why should it not go on?
Nothing in Austria has changed.
Singing and music will show this to the world.
Austria is the same.
Ηeil Hitler.
Ηeil Hitler.
[ Sniffs ]
Come on, children, let's go home.
- Why was he so cross?
- Everybody's cross these days, darling.
[ Marta ] Maybe the flag with the black spider on it makes people nervous.
- Is Father going to be in trouble?
- He doesn't have to be.
The thing to do these days is to get along with everybody.
I want you all to remember that tonight at the concert.
Are we really going to sing before a whole lot of people tonight?
Of course. Look, the Von Trapp Family Singers.
And here are your names- Liesl, Friedrich...
Louisa, Brigitta, Kurt, Marta and Gretl.
Why am I always last?
- Because you are the most important.
- Oh!
There we go.
[ Brigitta ] Uncle Max, are you sure Father will approve of our singing in public?
Oh, he'll be pleased and proud.
- Liesl, do you think so?
- Don't you trust me?
- [ Brigitta ] No!
- You're a very intelligent girl.
- [ Chuckles ]
- [ Rolfe ] Liesl! Liesl!
[ Liesl ]
Rolfe!
- Rolfe, I'm so glad to see you. It’s been such-
- Good afternoon.
You will take this, please, and deliver it to your father as soon as he comes home.
- Ηe's on his honeymoon.
- I know that.
- You do?
- We make it our business to know everything about everyone.
- Who's we?
- See that he gets it.
- What is it?
- It’s a telegram from Berlin.
Don't you want to come over tonight and deliver it yourself?
I am now occupied with more important matters... and your father better be, too, if he knows what's good for him.
But, Rolfe-
Father! Father!
- We didn't expect you so soon.
- Hello, hello, hello!
- When did you get back?
- We didn't expect you home until next week.
[ Kurt ]
Did you bring us any souvenirs from Paris?
[ Maria ]
Hello! How are you?
[ Friedrich ]
Why didn't you telephone us?
We tried to, but we couldn't get through.
I had nothing to do with that, Georg.
We came back as fast as we could.
Well, well, well, well, well! We missed you!
We missed kissing you good night.
We missed all the noise you make in the morning telling each other to be quiet.
- Mostly, we missed hearing you sing.
- Oh, you came back just in time.
Look, Fraülein Maria- I mean, Mother.
- We're going to sing in the festival tonight.
- What?
- [ All Chattering ]
- Yes, we've been rehearsing all-
Surprise, surprise!
All right, surprises for you on the terrace.
[ Marta ]
Presents!
We'll talk about this inside.
I would have told you, but you were away.
I had to make a last-minute decision.
- I was fortunate to enter them at all.
- Max.
- They'll be the talk of the festival.
- Max. lmagine, seven children in one family.
Max!
Somehow I recall having made it quite clear to you... how I feel about my family singing in public.
But the committee heard them. They were enchanted.
- What did they say?
- I have never heard such enthusiasm.
Oh, darling, don't you think- just this once?
Absolutely out of the question.
Georg, this is for Austria.
For Austria? There is no Austria!
But the Anschluss happened peacefully.
- Let's at least be grateful for that.
- Grateful?
You know, Max... sometimes I don't believe I know you.
Father, I forgot. This is for you.
[ Door Opens, Closes ]
Maria, he has got to at least pretend to work with these people.
You must convince him.
- Max, I can't ask him to be less than he is.
- Then I'll talk to him.
If the children don't sing at the festival, well, it will be a reflection on Austria.
Oh, I know. It wouldn't do me any good either.
- Mother?
- Hmm?
- That sounds so nice. I like calling you mother.
- I like hearing it.
- You love Father very much. I can tell you do.
- Very much.
Mother, what do you do when you think you love someone-
I mean, when you stop loving someone... or he stops loving you?
Well, you cry a little.
And then you wait for the sun to come out.
It always does.
There are so many things
I think I should know, but I don't.
- I really don't.
- How can you?
Sometimes I feel the world is coming to an end.
And then you feel it's just beginning?
- Yes.
- It was that way with me, Liesl.
And for you, it will be just as wonderful, I promise.

[ Von Trapp ]
Liesl.
- What is it?
- Berlin.
They've offered me a commission in their navy.
I've been requested to accept immediately... and report to their naval base at Bremerhaven tomorrow.
I knew something like this would happen... but I didn't think it would be so soon.
To refuse them would be fatal for all of us.
And joining them would be... unthinkable.
Get the children all together.
Don't say anything that's going to make them worry.
Just get them ready.
We've got to get out of Austria... and this house... tonight.
[ Crickets Chirping ]
[ Max ]
It strains my back, it breaks my heart... when I think of a certain singing group that will not appear at the festival tonight.
By the time you've made the announcement, we'll be over the border.
- I hope you appreciate the sacrifice I'm making.
- You have no choice.
I know. That's why I'm making it.
[ Marta ]
Why doesn't Father turn the motor on?
- Because he doesn't want anyone to hear us!
- Shh!
[ Louisa ] What will Frau Schmidt and Franz say when they discover we're gone?
They'll be able to answer truthfully.
They didn't know anything about it if anyone asks them.
- Will we be coming back here?
- Someday, Liesl.
I do hope someday.
[ Gretl ] Are Father and Uncle Max going to push the car...
- all the way to Switzerland?
- Shh!
Something wrong with your car, Captain?
Yes, as a matter of fact, we couldn't get it started.
Karl.
Fix Captain von Trapp's car so that it will start.
[ Car Engine Starts ]
Excellent, Karl.
I've not asked you where you and your family are going.
Nor have you asked me why I'm here.
Well, apparently, we're both suffering from a deplorable lack of curiosity.
You were sent a telegram, which you did not answer.
A telegram from Admiral von Schreiber of the navy of the Third Reich.
I was under the impression, Herr Zeller... that the contents of telegrams in Austria are private!
At least the Austria I know.
I have my orders.
And they are to take you personally to Bremerhaven tonight... where you will accept your commission.
I'm afraid that's going to be quite impossible.
You see, we, uh- uh, all of us- the entire family- will be... singing in the festival tonight.
As a matter of fact, that's where we were going now.
Couldn't possibly let them down now.
I just hope we're not too late.
Yes.
And you ask me to believe that you,
Captain von Trapp, are singing in a concert?
Believe me, it will be a performance beyond anything even I've dreamt of.
Like you, Herr Zeller...
I, too, am a man of hidden talents.
[ Max ]
Yes, um- Here.
The program.
It says here only the names of the children.
It says the Von Trapp Family Singers... and I'm the head of the von Trapp family, am I not?
And these, um, travel clothes that you're all wearing?
Our costumes, naturally.
Ηerr Zeller, this night air is not good for the children's voices.
Well, a slight delay in my orders will not be serious.
Therefore you will sing.
You will all sing, but only because that's the way I want it to be.
It will demonstrate that nothing in Austria has changed.
And when you are finished singing... you, Captain von Trapp, will be taken to Bremerhaven.
Now, if you will all get into your car... we will escort the Von Trapp Family Singers to the festival.
No escort will be necessary, Ηerr Zeller.
Necessary? A pleasure, Captain.
After all, we would not want you to get lost in the crowds... would we?
No.

I think it'll work. I shall miss all of you.
I shall miss the money I could have made with you.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
The festival competition has come to its conclusion... except, of course, we don't know yet what that conclusion will be.
And while the judges are arriving at their decision...
I have been given permission to offer you an encore.
This will be the last opportunity the von Trapps will have... of singing together for a long, long time.
Even now, officials are waiting in this auditorium... to escort Captain von Trapp to his new command... in the naval forces of the Third Reich.
[ Audience Murmuring ]
And so, ladies and gentlemen, the family von Trapp again... to bid you farewell.

Oh, Reverend Mother, we didn't realize... we'd put the abbey in this danger.
No, Maria. It was right for you to come here.
We thought we might borrow your caretaker's car.
I'm afraid our car will do you no good now.
I've been listening to the wireless.
The borders have just been closed.
All right, if the borders are closed... then we'll drive up into the hills and go over those mountains on foot.
- The children.
- We'll help them. They'll be all right.

We can do it without help, Father.

And this is certainly nothing like one.
Come on, Cyril, in seven days we'll be on our holiday.
Seven more days and we'll be on our holiday.
- Very well put, Edwin.
- Where are we going to, anyway?
Steve, my boy, I've got it all worked out.
- Yeah?
- Assuming we can hitchhike free to the French Riviera and taking into account present prices there, and the sum total of our savings, we'll be able to stay there for three whole luxurious hours.
Very funny! Ha-ha!
Look, but seriously, fellas, what are we gonna do?
I don't know. I think Don's got something up his sleeve.
- Yeah.

I've persuaded London Transport to lend us this old bus.
We fix it up like a mobile hotel.
This year, we live in it, take it to the South of France.
Then next year, we'll be ready to take paying passengers.
The sky's the limit!
- Great! Marvellous!
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- One thing.
- We've got to do the fixing.
- That's all we've got to do?
That's all we've got to do, hmm.
Oh, come on, we've got plenty of time.
Plenty of time? Seven whole days?
It's easy when you've got friends.
We'll get some of the fellas to help us.
Come on! Come on, everybody, we need your help.

- Hey, what's up, doc?
- Well, look at that thing ahead of us.
- What is it?
- I dunno, but it shouldn't be on the road.
- What's the matter?
- Look at that, look!
Aah!
Why doesn't he stop hooting his horn?
There's plenty of room to pass!
Oh, don't take any notice of them. You know what they say about French drivers.
In a London bus?
- Ah, but they won't stop.
- He thinks you want to pass.
- They can't see us for baggage.
- I'll have to get alongside.
- What's the French word for wheel?
- Erm?
- La wheel!
- No!
- "La" what?
- What's the matter with the English word?
- Because they're probably French!
- Oh, yeah.
Roue! Roue, that's the French word for wheel.
- Roue!
- Roue! Roue!
- The wheel! The wheel!
- What's he say?
Rue. That's French for road.
Roue! Roue! Roue!
- It's as much our rue as it is yours!
- Roue!
What else did you get for Christmas?!
We're just trying to say...
Will you please get out of our way?!
Ow!
Oh!
Well, go and see how the girls are while I see what the bus is doing.
- Oh, the girls!
- Yeah, let's go and see how they are.
Well, they look alright.
Women!
Everything they say about women drivers is true!
Of all the stupid, idiotic, dangerous...
Women drivers indeed! It's people like you that shouldn't be allowed on the road.
I'm Cyril.
I'm Sandy.
We just wanted to let you know about your wheel.
If you'd been watching where you were going instead of shouting at us,
- we'd need never have met!
- Oh, Sandy, don't be beastly to them.
- It wasn't their fault, was it?
- Steve, Steve Jones.
- I'm Angie.
- Glad to know you, Charlie.
I'd just like to say, miss, that the accident would've been far more serious had it not been for your superb driving and very quick thinking.
Oh, glad that didn't go unnoticed.
You certainly didn't mean any harm, did you?
- Cyril.
- I'm Cyril. He's Edwin.
- Oh, yes, of course, Edwin.
- Oh, it's my favourite name!
- Really? Oh!
- Anyone hurt?
- Hey, what's the damage?
- Well, the light and the radiator,
- but we should make it to Paris.
- Great!
Hey, but your car doesn't look so hot. What hit you?
Maybe it's lucky for you that we stopped.
Now you can travel in comfort.
We're not going on a London bus if that's what you had in mind.
Well, you're not going to get very far on your holiday in this thing!
We're not going on a holiday, we're on our way to an engagement.
We're a singing trio and we're on our way to our latest and greatest engagement.
- In six days.
- It's our first job.
Singers! Well, that's great.
We can have you wherever you wanna be in a couple of days.
- Paris, Cannes, Nice...
- Athens.
Athens. Athens?!
I think it's conference time, gentlemen.
Ladies, excuse us a moment.
- Will you get out? Try again now.
- They're never gonna make it in that car!
Start the ignition. We'll give it a push.
Come on.
Hey, if we go as far as Athens, maybe I can drive.
Yeah, maybe, Edwin, maybe.
Yeah. Well, those in favour of taking the girls?
- Edwin?
- Oh!
Let's go!
Good news, girls. My board of directors and myself have unanimously agreed to take you all to Athens in the company coach.
- But we don't...
- As our guests.
You could have saved the board meeting.
We're not hitchhikers.
- We've got transport of our own.
- Look, take it from me, we're all expert mechanics and...
Well, this car's a right-off.
Now how do you know?
You haven't even looked at it.
Yes, the least you can do is look at it.
Very well, gentlemen, let's look at it.
- What are they going to do?
- Just don't take any notice.
What are you doing?
Angie.
Get out!
Come on.

Oh, a few hours in Paris can be like a lifetime! Oh!
Oh, I feel so cool!
Ooh! Cool!
- Sandy?
- Yes.
- I've never met a singer before.
- You must have.
Well, not a professional, I mean.
Oh, you can't really call me a professional. I've never been paid.
I bet you've got a lovely voice.
Mm, it's not really good enough to be a solo.
In the trio, you don't notice it so much.
I bet I'd notice it anywhere.
Would you?
So then we decided to call ourselves
Do, Re and Mi.
- I thought of that. Do you like it?
- Yeah.
I think a good name for an act is very important.
Yes, I've heard that.
Of course I've heard it!
I said it!
Hey, Charlie, has anyone ever told you that you are the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen?
- Do you call everyone Charlie?
- No, only the people I dig.
- But why Charlie?
- I don't know.
It's an up-name.
Happy, you know what I mean?
- Oh, like good-time Charlies?
- Yeah, that's right.
Do you like my name - Angie?
Oh, I think it's the most, Charlie.
- Hi.
- Everything ready, Don?
- Everything's fine.
- Oh, you should've seen it!
I know, I know, but we've got to get going.
- Oh!
- Not yet.
- Well, you do want to get to Athens?
- Yep, he's right. Let's go.
Come on. Where's Steve?
Come on, hit it!
Let's hear you play, come on!
Go!
Hey!
- Go, go!
- Hey, yes!
Hey! Look out!
Yee-ha!
Ouch!
Thank you!
Oh, come on, we've gotta go!
Come on, let's stop now!
Yeah! Yeah!
All right, we must get out in about five minutes.
- Hey!
- Oh, please!
Come on!
Come on!
Oh!
Whoa!
Steve!
Time to go.
Come on, let's get him out of here.
Not too loud.
We mustn't disturb the neighbours!
- Don, where did you get to tonight?
- Oh, I went to a café near the garage.
Had a great meal.
Food! Of course, food.
I knew we'd forgotten something. Food!
- Girls, to the kitchen.
- I'm hungry.
I'll do the table.
You know...
I might just start off with some lovely French onion soup.
Followed by roast duck in orange sauce.
Finishing with crêpes Suzette.
- Well, you'll have baked beans.
- With an egg on top.
And like it. Now, turn off the music and help me lay the table.
- Come on!
- Oh, watch it! Mind the disc!
Look out back there.
We're coming to a railway crossing.
Oh, oh, oh! Watch it!
Edwin!
Not me this time.
Hey, what was that?
- I think we've got mice.
- King-sized mice.
I think we'd better find out who's up there.
Girls, stay down here.
- Boys, let's take a look.
- Yeah, you take a look.
Oh, come on!
Blimey!
It's a boy.
Yeah, he looks frightened.
Hey, what do you know? Our first stowaway.
Alright, young fella, what's it all about?
Maybe he doesn't understand English.
I'll speak French. Erm...
Parlez-vous français?
Are you lost, Charlie?
Êtes-vous perdu, Charlie?
- Ask him where he comes from?
- Oui.
Où est la plume de ma tante?
Oh, leave him alone.
Can't you see he's scared?
Yes, poor little boy.
He can't be more than 14.
- Well, he should be able to talk.
- He's probably hungry.
- Well, he can't understand.
- You watch. Manger?
Manger?
Yes, that settles it. No more questions till he's had something to eat.
You're English?
American?
How old are you?
Have you run away from home?
- Oh, I haven't got a home.
- Oh! Did you want to ride on the bus?
- Mmm.
- Well, where do you want to get to?
- We're going to Athens.
- That's where I want to go!
Oh, well, you eat your meal and we'll see what we can do.
I... I think we ought to bury the scraps outside.
Cyril.
And we'll get the sleeping bags ready.
Have you finished?
- Shh! Cyril.
- What are we gonna do, Don?
Well, we can't keep him here, that's for sure.
Perhaps we could drop him off at the next police station.
No. If we do that, we'll get tied up with
French red tape for at least a month.
- Well, maybe he's run away from home.
- He said he hasn't got a home.
Probably just a hitchhiker.
There are dozens of them all over.
Well, we've got to make up our minds quickly,
- cos as it is we're pushed for time.
- To get to Athens?
Yup. We've got to rush through
France, Switzerland, Austria and then we've got two days for Yugoslavia and Greece.
That means we get to Athens by Saturday.
Do we take him?
Crazy.
Bury these, Edwin.
Well, it looks like you've got yourself a ride. What's your name?
Bar... Bobby.
- Welcome aboard, Bobby. My name's Don.
- Steve.
- Sandy.
- I'm Cyril.
- Angie.
- Mimsie.
- Hello.
- The one outside's Edwin.
Listen, we'd better turn in. We've got an early start tomorrow morning.
- Goodnight, girls.
- Goodnight, boys.
You stay here with us.
Here, Bobby.
Er, do you always sleep with all your clothes on?
Yes.
Goodnight.
How does this sound?
"Dear Mummy, France is very well.
We've picked up lots of culture.
- Love, Sandy."
- Oh, that's fine, Sandy.
How about this one to Ken?
"Dear Ken, the world is beautiful.
Things really swing when you travel by bus.
The sky is bluer, the sun is brighter and the girls are lovelier."
Signed Don.
Hey, that's sheer poetry, man.
Yeah, but not very accurate.
We've been sitting here for nearly an hour and I've not seen one lovely girl yet.
- Oh, yeah?
- Present company excluded.
- How about them?
- They're lovely?
Ooh, they're lovely.
What you guys don't understand is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
And when you're travelling, you're very beholden.
Yeah.

Hotel Napoleon, Paris, person-to-person, Mrs Winters.
Oui.
A TV show of her own, ten weeks' top money and what does she do?
She runs out of here someplace without even signing a contract.
Children these days don't know how to spell gratitude.
You did say she could have a holiday.
She's a star. A star can't just loaf around for ten weeks.
A star must work and work and work.
She's worked all her life. Supported the three of us since she was four years old.
She had a childhood that any other child would envy.
While other girls were filling their heads with algebra and geometry, she was learning practical things.
Like how to slip past the hotel clerk?
Oh! We travelled everywhere.
Running away from creditors.
- She got to see the country, didn't she?
- At that speed?
I don't want to speak to anyone.
Oh, how could she do this to me?
When I get hold of her, I'll give her a lesson she'll never forget.
- After all I've done for her.
- Hi, honey! How are you?
- I'll say, "Miss Barbara Winters..."
- Sure.
- Who is it?
- Barbara.
Barbara, baby! What are you doing to me?
Oh, I just hope...
I never have to spend another night like last night. Sick with fear... and worried to death. Where are you?
Never mind where I am, Mother.
I only called to let you know how I was and so you wouldn't worry.
But, baby, where are you?
I'm not going to tell you where I am.
What do you mean, you're not going to tell me where you are? I'm your mother!
I've a right to know.
Just a minute, honey, there's someone at the door.
Get on the other phone quick and have them trace this call.
Now, Barbara, baby, listen to me.
I'm your mother, your own flesh and blood.
And if you're not back here tonight by six o'clock, you're going to see flesh and blood turn into cold, hard steel!
Mother, I'm having more fun than
I've ever had and I'm not coming back.
Now, just get on the plane and go to New York, and I'll see you there in a few weeks.
- Come on, Don! Where you been?
- No, I can't... I've got to go. Bye-bye.
Barbara! Barbara!
Hey, wait!
Come on, Bobby!
Hello?
Oui.
Hey!
Barbara!
Well?
He called from a newspaper stall in Chaumont.
I spoke to the proprietor. He said the call was placed by a little boy.
It was not. I know
Barbara's voice when I hear it.
- She's in disguise.
- What's she in disguise for?
So you can't find her.
Are you intimating that she ran away from me?
- Who's intimating?
- What else did he say?
She's travelling with a bunch of English kids on a London bus.
One of those big red things and he heard them say something about going to Athens.
Athens? Well, what she want to go to Athens for?
I could tell you but you wouldn't like it.
Oh, here it is - Chaumont.
Now they'll be travelling along there.
- Their next stop would be "Soik-sant".
- What?!
"Soik-sant"!
- Soixante.
- Well, I'll have her stopped there.
Somebody bring up a towel.
Our local Casanova's having his second bath of the day.
Edwin... Oh!
Bobby, do us a favour, take him up a towel, there's a good lad.
- Me?
- You're not doing anything, are you?
Well... Well, yes. In fact...
I'm reading! This is very...
One soft towel coming up!
Hey, Bobby, tell him that's the last one.
After this, he'll probably have to use a handkerchief.
Hurry up with the towel.
- Here you are.
- Thanks, Bobby.
Don't go away!
I want to speak to you a moment.
- What about?
- About you.
You're not in any kind of trouble, are you?
Who, me?
Whatever gave you that idea?
Well, you're a bit young to go wandering around Europe all by yourself.
Excuse me.
I can take care of myself.
I may be young but I'm tough.
If that's the way you want it.
Pass me my shorts.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Well, just you remember, if ever you need any help, you know where to come.
Oh... Thanks. That... I'll get your shirt.
Oh, two buttons missing.
I'll sew them for...
I'll get one of the girls to sew them for you.
Yeah, I guess I'm better with a spanner than a needle and cotton. Pass me another.
Don, you need a woman to look after you.
Oh, no, not this one.
Mind you, girls are all very well, but at a distance.
Date them once and then run.
Date them twice and they're getting serious.
- They don't think the way we do, do they?
- Oh, you're so right.
They're off with that chat about marriage and weddings, and, "What's your favourite name for a girl?"
Next thing you know, you're hooked and wondering what hit you.
No. No girl is gonna own me.
What if you fall in love though?
I mean, what if you meet a girl that you want to own?
- Oh, that'll never happen.
- It could.
Suppose it did.
Well, I'd...
I'd...
Oh, well, you wouldn't understand.
You're only 14.
And a half.
What's all that hooting.
Come on, let's go and see.
- Would you get this character in the road.
- What is he doing?
What's with you, Charlie?
You tired of life or something?
- What do you think he is?
- I don't know.
Who's that?
What do you think he wants?
I think he wants to ask us something. Oh!
- Vroom!
- Oh!
- I've got it, I've got it!
- I think he's got it.
He's stuck here and he wants us to give him a lift to the next town.
- Of course!
- Oh, very brilliant.
But surely there must be a simpler way to ask somebody.
- I don't think he speaks English.
- I don't think he speaks.
- Ow! Ooh!
- Oh!
I do not have to speak, mon vieux.
I am the Great Orlando.
I speak the most international language of all.
- The language of mime.
- How's that?
I can say anything I wish with my hands.
- Very good.
- My face.
Well, say something.
- I think he wants a lift.
- Bon, bon, bon! You understood!
Actions speak louder than words.
How's this?
Très bien.
Time is flying, you have to be off.
- Oui.
- Voilà!
- And if you want a lift, hop aboard.
- Merci bien.
And while we are speeding along the highway, er,
I will teach you all the magical mysteries of mime, with, of course, the assistance of my company.
Mind what you're doing with your French stick!
Vive la France!
Vive la France.
Good morning, good morning. Hi, Annie.
- Hi.
- We found Barbara. She'll be back tonight.
No! No, no, don't let her come home.
Oh, Jerry, you mustn't be hard on her.
Think how I feel.
- Stella, look, look.
- You're only her agent.
But I'm her mother.
I've given up my life for her career.
True, you have.
I could have thought of myself all these years, but no, all I thought about was her security...
Look, Stella, will you please read this?
- It made the front page!
- That's what I've been trying to tell you!
Look, this is the greatest thing that could've happened and you know why?
Because it's a natural.
We didn't dream it up.
You couldn't buy this kind of publicity for a million bucks.
Look, Heather Harper got on the phone to me this morning.
- She did?
- Yeah.
She wanted the inside story of Barbara's disappearance, see?
- She didn't think it was phoney?
- No, no, no.
She said she wasn't at all surprised the kid ran away, cos she'd met you.
Oh, Jerry that's wond...
What she mean by that?
I... Well, who knows?
Look, the main thing is,
Barbara must not be brought back.
We've gotta milk this for all it's worth and it's worth at least ten days, maybe two weeks. Can you imagine it?
For two weeks, all over the world, people doing nothing but reading about and talking about
Barbara Winters. Everywhere.
London, Paris, Rome,
New York, Hollywood...
Hollywood? The Academy Award.
- Stella!
- She mustn't come back.
What have I been saying? Where is she now?
Well, she met up with a bunch of English kids and they're on a London bus going to Athens.
A London bus?
That's going to attract attention.
- We've gotta get it off the road.
- Maybe we could have them arrested.
- Arrested? For what?
- I don't know.
Oh! Wait a minute. I bet they haven't got a licence to carry passengers on that bus.
- Well, are they carrying passengers?
- What do you think Barbara is, baggage?
- Ah!
- Now, look, they'll be coming along here.
Call the police at that place and have them stopped.
- Yeah. "Swixant".
- Well... Yeah.
"Swixant". Yeah, hello.
Yeah, we'd like to place a call to the police at "Swixant".
Mention the name of that official we met at dinner the other night...
Yeah, yeah. Alright, yeah.
"Swixsant". S-O-I-X...
- Oh, come on!
- Soxiante. Yeah, fine. Eh?
Oh, yeah. She got the breakfast alright.
Look, police, Soixante.
That's right. Quickly.
Silence!
But really, sir, we weren't taking any money. Just giving them lifts.
They were in the road and they were all by themselves...
I have definite information that you were plying for hire in this dangerous bus.
You shall be made an example of. We cannot have such dangerous conduct in France, a country of good, careful drivers.
You will be remanded in the custody of this town, pending further investigation into this incident.
But we're just tourists on our way to Greece!
This entire affair is fraught with duplicity.
But I daresay we shall have the whole thing solved in a week's time.
- A week?!
- A week?!
Silence!
- Silence!
- We can't stay here for a week.
We've got to be in Athens in five days.
Your Honour, we did not use the bus for hire.
Yeah. Well, that is what you say.
But I have had word from Paris that says differently.
- But we don't know anybody in Paris.
- We have had information from Bonaparte.
Napoleon Bonaparte?
No, Himmi Bonaparte.
He is no relation but very high up in the ministry.
And if he says that you are bus passenger transporters, bus passenger transporters you are until you've proved differently.
- Monsieur le Président.
- Yes.
- Perhaps I can be of some assistance.
- Ah oui.
Ah oui, ah oui. Oh, ah, bon.
Who are you?
I am the Great Orlando, leader of this troop of entertainers.
So, now you are entertainers?
A moment ago, you were tourists.
A tourist can be many things.
Truly we are all entertainers.
I suppose this can be proved?
Monsieur, I ask nothing more than that you permit us to entertain you.
- Very well. Begin.
- Merci bien.
Now, I beg a few moments of the court's time to organise...
No, no, no, no! You want to give a show, you give it, here and now.
But we have need of props, makeup, costumes...
If you are entertainers, all you need is talent.
- Absolument vrai, Monsieur le Président.
- Oui, oui.
- Absolument vrai.
- Mmm.
Just as a judge needs nothing more than wisdom.
- Oh.
- Yet you wear this robe as a costume.
Use that gavel as a prop and this courthouse as your scenery.
Very well. You can have ten minutes to get ready and then you either begin your show or your jail sentence.
Very vite! Oh, pardon, monsieur.
What have you got us into?
We're not performers!
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!
You wish to get out of here, do you not?
- Yes!
- You will perform!
- Oh, we can't! We don't know how.
- You will learn!
- In ten minutes?
- Oui!
Look, we haven't even got a script.
We three are very professional performers.
We can't go out there saying any old lines!
Who has mentioned any old lines?
Have you already forgotten what I told you?
Actions speak louder than words.
Sylvie, la maquillage! Gaston, la scène!
Josephine, la musique! René, la costumes!
All of you, cher amis, give forth dans la plus belles spectaculaire du monde!
- Voilà!
- Voilà!
Voilà!
La plus belle au monde!
Vite, vite, vite!
Vite, vite, vite, mes amis, vite!
Don't forget, action is louder than words!
Whoop!
Oh!
I think we'd better beat it.
Oh, wait!
Call on me if you ever need work, my boy.
That's a splendid imitation of a girl.
Hello.
Look, I know I owe you all an explanation.
But I just can't. Please, if I could just go along and pay my fare, and... be treated like any of the other girls.
Careful! You don't know what you're saying.
You don't owe us an explanation.
You're welcome aboard the bus and as for paying...
Why don't you come along as a friend?
- Yes.
- Unanimous.
- Head 'em up and move 'em out!
- Let's get going!
- Oh, thank you!
- Let me see. I can't...
I must say, you've done alright for yourself. That's a very nice girl.
- All I did was ask her along on the bus.
- Yeah, she seemed very grateful.
Hey, what's this?
This is not a running buffet!
Yeah, I'd watch that girl. You know what they say about American dollies. Aw!
Cyril, not this boy.

- Well, where are they?
- They're departé. They've gone.
What do you mean, they've gone?
They were supposed to hold them here.
- Well, they didn't.
- That's French justice for you.
- How long have they been gone?
- Er, we... Er...
Monsieur, are you...? Er, a few hours.
- Well, come on then.
- Well, wait a minute.
Shouldn't have any trouble finding a London bus on the road.
Look, Stella, they're liable to be in Switzerland by now.
So, we'll stop them in Switzerland. Move!
Oh, the agonies of motherhood!
Come on, Cyril, where's my breakfast?
Isn't it your turn to take over yet?
Yeah, be with you in a minute, Steve.
- As soon as I finish shaving.
- Come on, Cyril.
Steve's breakfast is ready.
Does this bus never stop?
You know, I don't think
I slept a wink last night.
In that case, you'll remember that we stopped at the Swiss frontier.
- Last night.
- Did we? Oh, yeah, yeah.
If we can keep this up, we should be in Athens in plenty of time.
Hey, Steve, pull over a bit.
There's something coming up the road like a flipping rocket.
Hey, where's the fire, Charlie?
- Do you think they saw us?
- At this speed, even I can't see us.
Well, they'll never get up that road.
They'll have to take the other road about a mile back.
- Remove that sign.
- But, Stella...
If they go up there, they're liable to get stuck on the mountain.
- So what are we here for?
- You're so right.
- What's slowing us down?
- This hill.
I think it's a one-in-one.
Cyril, listen to me. Don't turn round!
Now, look, you and the others are still a bit worried about Barbara.
I have an idea. The bus stalls, you and the others walk up the hill with the gear, just to make it look authentic.
I drive Barbara up and find out all about her.
- I've got a better idea.
- What?
We drive the bus and you walk up the hill.
- Do you want me to find out about her?
- Yes.
- Good. Just back me up.
- I'll give the performance of my lifetime.
I'll probably get a busman's Oscar.
Don.
- Bachelor boy.
- Just tell me when.
When!
Ah!
- Edwin!
- Sorry, Cyril.
- Think you can make it now?
- Yeah. Wish me luck.
I'd better take someone with me though in case I run into any kind of trouble.
How about you, Barbara?
Well... Sandy, you're the lightest.
Oh, no! I want to stay with Cyril.
Yeah, come on, Barbara.
- All clear?
- Good luck, Charlie!
Good luck!
- Ready when you are!
- Ready when you are!
Move it! Come on!
Are you sure you know where you're going, Edwin?
You know, I think this mountain keeps growing as we climb.
Hey, look!
Oh!
- Oh! Oh, it's got no collar.
- Look, and no brandy.
Wouldn't you know, we find the only
St Bernard in Switzerland with no brandy.
Story of my life. Here we go then.
Bye-bye then.
Ah, look, he wants to join us.
Maybe we can take him with us to Athens.
- He doesn't seem to belong to anyone.
- You want to go to Athens, Charlie?
Well, that settles it.
But I'm warning you, if you turn out to be a girl too, then I'm leaving the bus.
Come on, Charlie!
We made it!
What's so funny?
Oh, I know.
You're laughing at me because of all those things I said to you yesterday.
No. No. I... I agree.
I think you were perfectly right.
- I was?
- Yes.
Why should a girl think that she owns a fella just because he holds her hand?
You know, I brought you up here to find out all about you, but... now I don't think it matters.
Oh. Thank you.
Hey, Barbara, wait a minute! Barbara!
I know what bothers you.
Maybe you think I'm going to be like every other girl you've ever known.
Afraid I'm going try to help you, want to own you.
Well, may I tell you something?
I don't want to own you.
I don't even want to rent you.
So, you haven't got a thing to worry about.
Sure. I'm not committing any crime, am I?
I just want to be...
Well, free, that's all.
I have nothing against love.
It's just that it ought to be easy and casual.
- Fun.
- That's right.
Yeah, that's right.
It's too light to go on forever.
I don't think anything should go on forever.
I lose interest in things after an hour.
Hey, we really see eye to eye, don't we?
On everything.
You know...
I could be interested in you.
Feel free.
Well...

Signorina, cinque birre, eh?
Hey!
Hey, Don!
Here come the others.
Excuse me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hey, where's Cyril.
- Oh, he's just coming.
- Hey, we've got a new passenger, too.
- Oh, you'll never guess what it is!
Yes, it's a...
Brandy!
- No sign of the bus yet?
- Nope.
Are you sure there isn't another road they could take?
Not unless they built a new one since yesterday.
Look, quit worrying. After three days, we move in for the big, dramatic rescue.
Yeah, I'll organise a couple of hundred photographers that just happen to be around.
Ah, watch it. We're not dealing with normal kids, you know.
- They're more like a bunch of Houdinis.
- Yeah.
Well, we'll just stake out the road from here.
I'll do it tonight and you take over in the morning.
I couldn't sleep with my darling daughter dying of exposure up there on that mountain.
Oh, I'm sorry, Stella.
I've never been a mother.
- Would you like something to eat?
- Just something simple.
Oh, my poor baby up there dying of starvation.
Champagne.
Truffles.
Smoked salmon and asparagus.
Hey, look!
I knew it!
What did I tell you? Bunch of Houdinis!
- Follow that bus!
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Wake Cyril up, Steve.
He's on in five minutes.
It'll be a pleasure.
Oh!
Cyril!
Come on.
Oh, what do you wanna wake me up for?
I was having a fabulous dream.
I dreamt I was on my holiday.
Oh, I know what he means! I feel as if
I haven't been out of this bus for a week.
Wouldn't it be marvellous if we could get all dressed up and go out somewhere?
Oh, marvellous!
We all owe the boys so much.
Why don't we, the next time we come to a town, take them out and give them a huge feast on us?
- Oh! With dancing and champagne?
- Yes!
I want to really dress up.
I was beginning to forget I'm a girl.
- Alright, those in favour?
- Oh, yes.
OK, you tell them, Angie.
Boys, boys.
My partners and I would like to have the honour to invite you to be our guests at our coming out party tonight.
- Coming out?
- Coming out of where?
Coming out of the bus party at the next town we come to.
Oh, that's great.
The next town should be Telfes. So you've got half an hour to get ready, girls.
Come on! Quick!
I'm going to have a shave.
- Well, how about this place?
- What a ritzy-looking joint!
Well, maybe we can find a smaller place.
Nonsense, this is our treat!
Only the best is good enough.
- It looks sehr gemütlich to me!
- Don't be filthy, Edwin!
What's filthy about gemütlich?
- Those no more wine.
- Well, we'll have some more.
- Fräulein! Bitte schön, ein bisschen wein.
- No, just some more wine.
- Have one more glass of wine.
- Yes, I will have some more.
This is the nicest place that we have been.
Yes, it reminds me though of some place that I know.
- I've seen it all before.
- Where?
White Horse Inn.
That's right!

What are you doing? Don?
I've got to speak to you.
Something's happened.
- Oh, not to the bus?
- Hang the bus! Something's happened to me.
What is it?
Well, remember those things I said to you about the way I feel about love.
Oh, I haven't forgotten a thing.
You want to be free, you don't want to be owned.
We needn't go through all that again now.
I want you to forget it.
I want you to forget everything I said.
I don't want to be free.
I do want to be owned.
And I am in love.

No, you're hurting me a little, but I'm riveted. Go on.

Here. Hide it well, they mustn't see it.
Well, does it have to be this?
This is worth a fortune.
So, it's insured.
Besides, if we keep the story running long enough, I'll have hundreds of them.
Cufflinks for you.
- Mission accomplished.
- Not quite.
We've got to inform Yugoslav border guys that a valuable diamond pendant is missing.
How do you get these fabulous ideas?
Pure mother love. Now, let's get going.
Here look, here's my passport...
I'm a foreigner! Do you mind?
Listen, I'm an English citizen!
I've got a British passport.
Look, that's my face! Look! Ooh!
It seems the, er, natives are restless.
Goodbye, Don. It was nice knowing you.
What do you think they're looking for?
I told you we shouldn't have tried to smuggle a bus.
Do you think Charlie's got a licence?
Maybe they're searching for dangerous weapons?
In that case, we can say goodbye to Steve's bongos.
Hey!
Oh, Charlie!
That's mine!
Mine.
He tried to steal my pendant, look.
It's got my picture in it.
- Let's move!
- Come on! Let's go!
Let's get out of here before they change their minds, huh?
Don't push, Cyril.
Goodbye!
Arrivederci!
- Bye!
- Goodbye!
Bye-bye!
- Cor, stone me! Did you see that, Cyril?
- Yeah. Innit marvellous?
Everybody seems to be driving Thunderbirds over here.
I'm not so sure everybody does.
That looks like the same one to me.
Put it over there. That road ought to delay them for a couple of hours.
With a little luck, they might even get lost.
- Over here?
- No! Over there!
Oh.
Lost?
I think we should've gone the other way.
That danger sign must be wrong.
- This isn't the main road.
- I dunno. This is a pretty wild country.
Look, you probably think I'm a bit mad, but I've got the strangest feeling that someone's trying to stop us getting to Athens.
- Who'd do that?
- Well, I don't know.
It's just that we're getting into too much trouble and having too many delays.
And how about that Thunderbird being everywhere?
That was just a coincidence.
- Perhaps he's trying to get to Athens too.
- Yeah, maybe.
Look, don't say anything to the others.
It'll only upset 'em.
- Donald?
- Yeah?
- Can we have tea now we've stopped?
- Yeah, we may as well.
Oh, who's a darling?
Sustenance.
Come on, girls, what fabulous dish have you prepared for our tea?
Well, we were going to have sandwiches, but we're short of one vital ingredient.
- Yeah, what's that?
- Who forgot to buy the bread?
- Oh!
- Oh!
Maybe there's a supermarket near.
Eh! Would you get a load of little Bo-Peep out there.
- Where?
- Look.
- Sheep.
- Little darling.
Eh, maybe she could direct us to the nearest loaf of bread.
Maybe. Come on, let's go.
No, stay with us, Charlie.
Stay there, Charlie, look after the girls.
Oh, wait a minute.
What's Yugoslavian for bread?
Oh, hang on.
Here's a guidebook.
The thingamajigs are at the back.
- See you, bye!
- Don't be long!
Hey!
- Hey, lady!
- Hey! Hey!
Here, come back!
Hey!
Hey, wait a minute!
Ow!
- Come back!
- Come back!
Relax!
We don't want anything. Look!
We just want to buy some bread.
- Bread?
- She doesn't understand.
- She looks scared to death.
- Oh, she's frightened.
Don't be afraid. We no hurty.
- We friends.
- Friends!
Me Tarzan, you Jane.
- Oh, she's not with it.
- Actions speak louder than words.
Whoa!
Oh, don't cry.
- Sing to her, sing to her.
- What for?
Well, then she'll know you're a friend.
Your enemies don't sing to you, do they?
- Well, what will I sing?
- Well, it doesn't matter.
She won't understand you.
Just sing something friendly.
Come on. He sings you something friendly.
Nice song, yes!
Yeah, come on, up.

Nèvjesta!
- Enough for eight.
- Nèvjesta!
- Nèvjesta!
- Nèvjesta!
Nèvjesta! Nèvjesta! Nèvjesta!
Nèvjesta! Nèvjesta!
Nèvjesta! Nèvjesta!
Nèvjesta! Nèvjesta!
Oh, well... Not too much though.
Enough for eight.
Are you sure nèvjesta means bread?
Hey, Don.
Bread is hleb.
Well, what does n èvjesta mean then?
- Bride.
- Bride?!
Oh, let's get out of here. Ooh!
Oi!
Aaah!
Ooh!
Ooh!
- Any sign of them yet?
- No, and it'll be dark soon.
- They've been gone almost an hour.
- An hour?!
Oh, those poor boys will be so hungry.
I told you we should've gone to Blackpool!
Hey, hey, hey! Keep moving, fellas!
Keep moving, fellas!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
I've got an idea!
What is it?
- Boom!
- That's it!
Ha-ha!
Hey!
- Oh!
- Oh!
Hey, get out!
I'll see you.
- We'll never make Athens in time!
- Oh yes, we will.
Hold on to your safety belts!
Oh, we made it!
What's all this?
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Donald Preston?
- Er, yes.
- Oh, congratulations.
Well done indeed, I must say.
My name's Wrightmore.
I'm with the British Consul here.
If there's anything I can do to help.
What's all this about? I mean...
I mean, how did you know we were coming?
Well, actually, you've made quite a sensation.
The sight of a London bus travelling on the Continent has aroused tremendous curiosity and the press are playing it big.
We've all been trying to follow your course.
- Well, here's yesterday's Daily Mail.
- Oh, it's us. Look, Steve.
"That London bus operated by four young mechanics would seem to be making its way to Greece.
A trio of singers known as
Do, Re And Mi... are known to be aboard the bus, as well as an unidentified American girl."
Come on! Come on!
"The bus was last seen...
Continued page three."
Oh, quick!
There they are!
I want those people arrested for the kidnapping of Barbara Winters!
What's this about?
This is ridiculous!
- Who are these people?
- Stop it!
Baby! Baby!
Mother, what on earth are you doing?
A million dollars' worth of publicity.
I swear I didn't know anything about this, Don.
Oh, sure! Just do me a favour.
The next time you want to travel, take a plane.
Don't worry! There must be some mistake!
I'll get you out!
Well, at least we'll be comfortable till the trial.
Yeah, it's alright.
Nice.
Girls?
The boys and I would like to say that...
Well, we're sorry, aren't we?
- Yeah.
- What for?
Well, if you'd caught your train, you'd be working instead of facing a kidnap charge.
Oh, boys. The girls and I would like to say, we wouldn't have missed it for the world, would we?
- No.
- There.
- I'll see you later.
- Don, where you going?
Nowhere. I just want to get some fresh air.
Oh, I wonder what it'll be like to sleep without stopping for red lights all the time.
I wonder what's happened to Don?
Don's got an acute case of the blues and I think we should just let him get it out of his system.

- Clap hands, here comes Charlie.
- Where have you been?
Oh, just walking.
- Well, who's that then?
- Must be the house detective.
- Mr Wrightmore.
- Everything alright?
- Oh, yes.
- Depends on what you mean by everything.
- A cable came for you this morning.
- Hey, what is it?
"Your request for additional buses for your project approved." Stop.
"We will give you all the support we can."
Stop.
"Very proud of you all." Stop. Signed
Onslow Harbour for London Transport.
If we had all those buses, maybe I could drive!
Maybe, Edwin.
All the way to the local jail.
Ooh, yeah.
Just wait till they hear that we've been accused of kidnapping our first passenger.
Look, Mr Wrightmore, we never kidnapped that girl.
She boarded the bus of her own accord.
Her mother must be suffering from delusions.
Yes, you're not far wrong.
I've just been talking to Mrs Winters.
They're both of them just down the corridor.
Well, she's having a press conference in the ballroom at six.
- What's Barbara's room number?
- Er, 483, I think.
- Thank you, Mr Wrightmore.
- Here, Don...
- Who is it?
- Me.
- Go away!
- Not on your life.
Now you listen here to me, Miss Barbara
Winters, if that's your real name.
I don't care what you've done or why you did it.
The fact is, I'm in love with you.
Don!
Of course, I realise it was nothing but a publicity stunt for you.
What beats me is why you didn't go the whole hog and marry me.
- Yes, I'd love to!
- Now that would be a great story.
Big American star marries bus mechanic.
- I'd love to.
- I can see it now.
Ten-inch banner headlines.
What did you say?
I said I'd love to marry you.
- Barbara.
- I love you.
- Shouldn't you open the door?
- She's locked me in.
It isn't any good.
She says that if I ever see you again, she'll put you and the others in jail,
- for years and years.
- Leave me to deal with your mother.
- But you don't know her.
- I'll see to her.
- Oh, Don, you don't know what she can do.
- I said, I'll deal with your mother.
- Don't go away now!
- I won't. But, Don...
Alright, quiet now! Quiet, please, quiet!
Take your seats, please.
Take your seats, please. Hi, Charlie.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I got you all here today to give you the lowdown on this story.
It's not a very pretty story.
It's a bit rugged.
Still, it's kind of a beautiful story at that because it concerns a mother.
Not just a mother, but an American mother.
And here she is, that self-same American mother, the very beautiful and charming
Stella Winters.
Thank you, thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, my story begins seven days ago.
Not a long time, you'll say.
But a whole lifetime for a mother whose daughter has been kidnapped.
Come on!
Barbara!
The boys will get you out. I've got to go.
I've got an important date with the press.
- Get weaving, Steve.
- Crazy.
- Come on, Cyril, you're the smallest.
- Yeah, but you're the strongest.
- Edwin.
- No, fellas! No, fellas! Mind the suit!
Oh, careful! Oop!
- Come on, get in!
- I'm not used to heights!
Cyril!
Cyril?
- You pushed.
- Oh, Cyril!
What are you doing?
Hurry up, we haven't got all day.
Right, careful. Come on.
- Come on.
- Ow!
Am I hurting you, Cyril?
No! No.
- We've got ya!
- That's it. That's it.
- You OK, Barbara?
- I think so.
- Right, let's go.
- Hey, fellas!
- Oh.
- Fellas.
We'll catch you.
Oh!
Finally, here in Athens,
I caught up with those hoodlums.
And now my lovely daughter, Barbara, is back with me.
Right now, I ask only one thing.
I'd like to meet up with one of those hoodlums face to face.
Well, that shouldn't be difficult.
I'm one of them.
- This is a hood?
- You?!
You've got a nerve turning up here!
There are two sides to every question and I thought the gentlemen of the press would like to hear our side.
- It's OK.
- Well, how about it?
Listen, kid, we're not interested in taking sides.
We are interested in you.
You got something to say, say it.

What did you think of that, Mrs Winters?
Why, if Barbara were here, she'd tell you it's all a pack of lies.
Do you mean that if Barbara really loves this guy, you'd give your consent?
If my daughter loved that... boy, I'd drop all charges.
All I care about is my darling baby's happiness.
Well, I do love him, Mother.
- What?
- Oh...
Oooh! Oooh!
Is it true you're in charge of taking a party of 200 London buses to the Riviera next year?
200 buses?
Will you be forming your own company soon?
He'll be big. He's going right to the top.
Oh, he needs someone to shape his career.
Is it true you're going to form an American branch of your company?
Jerry, there's nothing we couldn't become.
A transport tycoon.
They'll make us a lord.
We'll be presented at court.
- We'll curtsy.
- Stella, Stella.
Stella, now, look, look, please.
Young man... you may kiss me.
Baby, oh!
Don!
Oh. Well, thanks again for everything, Mr Wrightmore.
- We'll be back as soon as we can.
- Good.
I've had a lot of requests from tourists who'd like to make this trip with you.
Well, you can tell them that Double

In a bungalow all covered with roses
I will settle down I vow.
That's why I'm looking at the world through rose-coloured glasses...
There are those, I suppose, think we're mad, Heaven knows.
The world has gone to rack and ruin.
What we think is chic, unique and quite adorable they think is odd and
Sodom- and Gomorrah-able.
But everything today is thoroughly modern.
Check your personality.
Everything today makes yesterday slow.
Better face reality!
It's not insanity, says Vanity Fair.
In fact, it's stylish to raise your skirts and bob your hair.
In a rumble seat the world is so cosy if the boy is kissable.
And that tango they wouldn't allow now is quite permissible.
Goodbye, good-goody girl,
I'm changing and how!
So beat the drums,
'cause here comes thoroughly modern Millie now.
Everything is thoroughly modern.
Bands are getting jazzier.
Everything today is starting to go.
Cars are getting snazzier.
Men say it's criminal what women'll do.
What they're forgetting is that this is 1922.
Have you seen the way they kiss in the movies? Isn't it delectable?
Painting lips and pencil-lining your brow now is quite respectable.
Goodbye good-goody girl,
I'm changing and how!
So beat the drums,
'cause here comes thoroughly modern Millie now.
35 cents, please.
- A pen, please.
A pen?
- To write a check.
35 cents I said, not 35 dollars.
Who writes a check for 35 cents?
Oh, I do.
You can get it from your desk clerk.
But I don't live here, as yet.
Look, a pen.
Lady, I got 7 kids and 1 in the oven.
I can't take a check.
The date?
- I can't take no check!
No check? But it's from the Gotham National Bank.
I don't give a hoot...
- Can I help?
You got 35 cents cash?
American?
Yes, I think so.
- Thank you, Miss.
Yes, I do.
Here: 10, 20, 30... 5.
You did say 35?
- Yeah, yeah.
Ain't every day you meet a Vanderbilt and a Rockefeller.
Thank you.
Oh, but my bags?
It's all right. We can manage.
I live here. - Oh, thank you.
Allow me.
It is a middle-class hotel, isn't it?
- Yes.
Perfect.
- My name is Millie Dillmount.
Perfect. I'm Miss Dorothy Brown from California.
I do hope there's room for me.
Yes?
Dear me.
This is Mrs. Meers, our house mother.
- How do you do?
How do you do? I'm
Miss Dorothy Brown from California.
How do you do? And who are you?
Oh, you're Millie. - It's the new me.
Toss your cares and curls away.
What can we do for you, Dorothy?
Miss Dorothy. I'm looking for a room.
I have a nice one on the 12th floor.
On the 12th floor? - Yes.
Directly across the hall from you.
Ethel Peace just checked out.
- But she only just checked in.
She went back to Wyoming.
But why?
She has no one there.
Oh, just a restless girl.
Now if you'd register, Dorothy.
I mean, Miss Dorothy.
The mail just came in.
Always some for you, Millie.
Lonely lady?
One from Brother in Chicago, two from
Mother, one from Sister in Detroit.
Millie has such a big, warm family.
You have such a big, warm family, Miss Dorothy?
I'm an orphan.
- Are you?
Sad to be all alone in the world.
Thank you.
Gung ho, dear.
Heavy on the starch!
Thank you, Millie.
How long have you lived here, Millie?
You look lived in.
About 3 months.
Yes, I'm getting quite hard.
I'm looking for life raw and real.
I'm going to be an actress.
An actress? How exciting.
- Yes, But I've got to live first.
You should do very well on stage.
Pictures, too.
Would you mind closing the doors and pressing number 12? - Not at all.
Thank you.
It's broken. - No, just temperamental.
Try again.
Some showgirls used to practice their routines in here.
Oh, I love it. In the Ritz elevator all you do is go up and down.
Would you mind taking over?
Is today your day off?
You are working girls, aren't you?
Just a minute. Yes, I just put myself through business school.
A stenog.
Tomorrow I start interviewing bosses.
- I thought the other way around.
I can type 40 words in a minute.
I'm in demand.
Besides, I'm going to marry my boss, whoever he may be.
You're a modern.
- Thoroughly!
I must study you if I'm going to be an actress.
The theatre is full of ruthless women.
"Art reflects life."
That was in a speed test.
But it's true. Women today are free.
For the first time we're man's equal.
We can make a life for ourselves.
And I fully intend to.
- So do I.
Would you mind opening the door,
Miss Dorothy?
Something tells me you're not poor.
Ask me no questions, and I'll tell you no lies.
One thing I know for sure.
You've travelled a lot.
Miss Dorothy?
There's little else for an orphan to do. - Here we are.
I'm just across the hall, if you need anything.
There's a dance tonight.
Wanna go?
Perfect. Would you introduce me to the gang?
They're pretty high-spirited.
- Poor people usually are.
Watch out for the boys.
They pinch.
Excuse me, please.
Don’t worry, the kids will soon forget your dress is real lace.
Don’t be concerned.
I'm having the most interesting time.
10 cents, girls.
For decorations and refreshments.
I left my checkbook upstairs.
- I've got it. - Oh, Millie.
Dip in and get your money's worth.
Millie, Millie, this is him.
Terrif!
Oh, delish!
Good evening.
Can I help you?
- It couldn't hurt.
I mean, are you looking for someone?
- Not anymore.
He's fresh as paint.
- He's just full of apple sauce.
May I introduce myself? - It's just a friendship dance. - Jimmy Smith.
Millie Dillmount, and this is Miss
Dorothy Brown. - Pleasure to meet you.
I was just passing the hotel when I heard the snappy music.
You don't know anyone here?
- Sure, you. Dance?
I studied ballroom and tap, but I'm not up on the latest dances.
I always make up my own anyway.
Dorothy. - Miss Dorothy.
Give me a name. - What for?
- Our new dance.
I never named a dance before. - What did you have for dinner? - Franks.
Franks?
What else?
- Sauerkraut. - Sauerkraut?
No, what else?
Tapioca pudding.
Tapioca?
Join me in the tapioca? And...
Well, then.
Now what do I do?
- Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap.
That's too hard.
- Where are you going?
Everybody, tap, tap, tap, tap.
Tap, tap, tapioca. Everybody, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slapioca.
If you got the dap, dap, dap, dap, dappier flappers, flap, flappier.
Everyone is happier when they do the tap tapioca... when they do the flap flapioca...
A cup of punch, Miss Dorothy?
- Oh, yes, please.
Welcome to the Priscilla.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- Yes.
They are clever, aren't they?
- Yes, aren't they?
Millie's a wonderful girl.
- Sweet.
A good friend, too.
First real friend I've ever had.
Sad to be all alone in the world.
My own recipe. Fruit.
Mrs. Meers, meet a terrif dancer and a nice person, Jimmy Smith.
This is Mrs. Meers, our house mother.
- Pleasure to meet you.
Allow me. - Darn nice manners.
What a personality.
Care to dance, Mrs. Meers?
- Thank you. No.
I believe this one is mine.
And this is yours, Miss Dorothy.
Care to dance, Miss Dorothy?
- Oh, no thanks.
Go on, do it.
- I shan't break up a splendid team.
A darn nice party, Mrs. Meers.
- Please, go, enjoy yourselves.
You know the tapioca? - I believe not.
- It's the latest.
Well, I'm here to learn.
Pretend we've got a bowl.
We're gonna have some sport. Ha!
Add trumpled licks and a ragtime beat.
About a quart. Yeah!
Ya stir and stir with your knee, adding a bump or two.
Ya heat it, mash it, beat it, smash it, if there's a lump or two.
Don’t let the temperature drop too many degrees, or you'll wind up with what is called the frozen tapioca freeze.
Everybody... tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tapioca.
Everybody, freeze!
Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slapioca.
Everybody, freeze!
Cinderella time?
- I'm afraid so.
I've got my employer's red roadster outside. Care for a spin?
Sure.
I have to be back by 10:30.
- You betcha.
Look out!
I love driving on the wrong side.
Don’t you? - Terrif.
Take the wheel.
- I've never driven a car.
You never named a dance before.
The starter, the gas and the break.
The starter, the gas and the break.
- Yeah.
What other firsts ahead? Love?
Love? I see you're old-fashioned.
Okay?
Not too old-fashioned.
That's nice to hear, but I know I could do better.
Jimmy, I'm going to marry my boss.
- When?
I don't know. I haven't got one yet.
I start looking for work tomorrow.
But I have plans, and I think it only fair that you know.
Terribly fair.
I'm your equal. I'm going to meet you men on your own terms, cater to your craving for efficiency, learn to talk sports, tell jokes, smoke, drink and, if I have to,
I'll even kiss you back.
Love has nothing to do with it.
- I see.
We fought the war to end all wars.
Now's the time for fun, especially for the new woman.
'Cause the old rules are out, and they haven't made up new ones.
I never met a modern before.
- My beauty spot!
How am I doing?
- You're doing well.
What do you do for your employer?
What?
- I mean, what's your line of work?
I'm in steel equipment for offices.
Oh, paper clips like?
- Yeah. - I must get back.
Can I see you again?
That is, until you get engaged?
Oh, sure.
It's the 20th century.
I hope I'm up to it.
Mrs. Meers.
So late and still working?
Yes, very late.
Everybody should be in bed by now.
I have to do something here with this spot on the carpeting.
A spot? - Yes.
- Where? - Here.
I can't see a thing.
What kind of cleaner is that?
Soy sauce.
- Soy sauce?
What do you know?
I must write Mama.
Do that.
Good night.
Soy sauce.
Have a good time? - Sure.
He had his employer's red roadster.
Oh, Millie. Machines like gloves should be black or white.
Are you sweet on him?
Oh, no. I've no time for puppy love.
I start boss-hunting in the morning.
Right. Good night. - Good night.
- Good luck. - Thank you.
Oh, give them hell.
Soy sauce.
Flannery, Miss Flannery.
Director of female personnel.
I run a no-nonsense organization.
Is that rouge?
- Yes, ma'am.
Why did you call ahead to make sure
Mr. Graydon was single?
I have no more time to waste.
You look fast to me.
- 40 words a minute.
No nonsense, girl. Mr. Graydon's door is at the end of the hall.
Thank you.
He means, "Come in."
Hi, there, Miss Dillmount.
Right on the old button!
That's swell, just swell!
"Punctuality, the pride of princes."
Beautiful.
How's that? - Your beautiful baseball trophy. I love baseball.
I won it for golf.
I love golf, too.
Swell game. Play much?
Golf's my hobby, insurance my business.
You come highly recommended.
Bolt the door, take off your things.
Take a letter to... to Mr. Harold Hudson.
You'll find his letter in the file and an invoice in the outer desk.
"Dear Mr. Hudson,
The shipment of floor wax was rancid..."
Babyface, you've got the cutest little
Babyface.
There is no other one could take your place,
Babyface.
You sure have started something.
Babyface,
I'm up in heaven when I'm in your fond embrace.
I didn't need a shove,
'cause I just fell in love with your pretty Baby...
You've got the cutest little...
Swell.
Swell.
Congratulations, Miss Dillmount.
You've made the team.
Miss Dorothy.
No luck today either?
No, Mrs. Meers.
The only thing producers want to do with me is take liberties.
Sinful, but cheer up.
I've got something for you.
A California apple for you.
Thank you, Mrs. Meers.
It smells so fresh.
I'll bet it's juicy.
We had apple orchards.
Don’t look back.
Face it.
Don’t, Miss Dorothy!
You'll spoil your appetite. They're going to set a doozy of a table.
Hello, Mrs. Meers. Did you forget about the wedding night? I'm singing.
Mazaltov!
Groom, bride, mazaltov.
Drink to life, it's wedding time.
Drink to life, drink a glass of wine.
Let us sing, it is such a joy.
Let us dance, we should be happy.
Play on, musicians, for the parents-in-law...
This is Jewish.
...for the groom.
Play louder, so we can't hear the two mothers crying bitter tears.
Drink to life is what mazeltov means.
Make a circle that turns and turns.
A happy person has money, too.
Drink to life for the entire world.
Dance everybody. Dance for the groom and the bride.
Be happy people.
Dance...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Drink to life, it's wedding time...
Mazeltov!
Mr. Graydon's office.
Who's calling, please?
Jimmy!
- Dillmount! - Hold on.
A telephone is business equipment.
Not a back fence to gossip over.
Yes, ma'am.
Hello.
- Are you sitting on his lap?
I've been here a week. Where were you?
On business.
- Oh, I wondered.
I spoke to my boss about your paper clips. - Thanks.
Did you kiss him back yet?
- No.
Has he held your hand? - No.
- Got a pet name? - Yes.
What? - John.
- John? - John. - John?
That's not very romantic.
But it's modern.
Mr. Graydon is very business-like.
But he's not cold.
He's manly, but not gruff.
He calls me John, because I'm so efficient. "Johnny on the spot."
I'm wearing a new dress, and...
- What time do you get off?
Half day Saturday.
- Like to go for an outing?
That sounds grand!
Lunch and dinner.
Ask Miss Dorothy to join us.
Miss Dorothy?
- She's still around?
Sure, I'll ask her.
- Pick you up at 12:45.
Fine. Jimmy, I'm still going to marry my boss.
Over my dead body!
I guess his nickel was up.
John, write a memo to Splife.
The paper was not up to snuff.
Yes, sir. - Sorry luck. Not pleased.
Take it back.
Yes, sir. Got you!
You ought to try a pipe.
Separates the men from the boys.
Mr. Graydon, you're just a tease.
- Swell dress.
Oh, Jimmy!
I said, the sky's the limit.
What a thrill!
My employer's. But he's out of town, so I can use it whenever I want to.
I'll teach you to fly.
- You're razzing me.
Just another first.
We're facing a lot of 'em, aren't we?
Jimmy, look there!
Raspberry!
Holy mackerel.
Who was that?
Mrs. Van Hosmere, our hostess.
The outing's at her house.
We're flying over it now.
- Where?
That's a house?
I mean, somebody lives down there?
It's a mansion, but she calls it a cottage.
My father used to be her gardener.
She's always been very good to me.
Miss Dorothy!
That house down there...
I can't hear...
- The party is down...
Oh, thank you.
That house down there...
Oh, look! Terrif!
A golf course. Mr. Trevor Graydon's favourite. That's where we're going.
Baron Richter, those loop-the-loops are affecting my inner ear.
Why, Baron Richter.
You're perfectly marvellous.
To think we were against you in the late war.
There you go.
Down you go, little Miss Dorothy.
Welcome, welcome, everybody.
Welcome, everybody. Hello, Jimmy.
The grass needs cutting.
She thinks I'm the only one who can trim the lawn like my father.
Do you promise to succumb wholeheartedly to the merriment?
Why, Mrs. Van Hosmere is glamorous and gay.
Muzzy, call me Muzzy.
You, too, Miss Dorothy.
My flying instructor, everybody does.
We're all very friendly here.
Jimmy, I am proud of you.
Two delightful young ladies. I had no idea you had such a good eye.
I do hope you all have the most marvellous time.
Anything you want and don't see, you just ring.
Well, now, what have we here?
Corky, the ace of hearts!
Love is very, very near.
You mustn't believe what you see.
Muzzy's full of tricks.
Baron Richter, I'm going to need popping soon again.
Sensational, Muzzy.
My dance instructor.
Gregory Huntley.
Oh, where'd you get that dress?
- I rang for it.
Gee whiz.
Great wealth is so classy.
Everything's so perfect.
It's just like in the movies.
Except for me. The very gates of real society in a plaid dress.
What's wrong? - I feel unworthy.
- You look worthy. - But look at her.
She looks very worthy, too.
You know, Jimmy, you're a pip.
Everybody likes you.
If you take it in stride, so can I.
- Who's better than we are?
Only in America can a gardener's son receive such spiffy treatment.
Jimmy.
Miss Tremaine, may I present...
- I've had the pleasure.
Millie Dillmount, Judith Tremaine.
How do you do?
I couldn’t help overhearing your remark about the gardener's son.
Jimmy's father had such a green thumb.
We hoped Jimmy would take after him.
But there's been little evidence.
Good gardeners are hard to come by.
Perhaps he prefers paper clips.
- Perhaps.
That gross diamond ring of Muzzy's took my breath away.
Not completely, Miss Tremaine.
No, not completely.
Bitch!
Miss Dorothy!
- I love you.
Ladies and gentlemen, attention! Thank you.
I have persuaded my star pupil that she's ripe, after only 5 nights of study, to make her singing debut tonight.
Okay, Muzzy.
She's miraculous.
My daddy was a ragtime trombone player.
My mommy was a ragtime cabareter.
They met one day at a tango tea.
There was a syncopated wedding, and then came me.
Folks think the way I walk is a fad.
But it's a birthday present from my mommy and daddy.
I'm a jazz baby.
Little jazz baby, that's me.
There's something in the tone of a saxophone that makes me do a little wiggle all my own.
I'm a jazz baby.
Full of jazz-bo harmony.
"Walk the Dog" and "Ball the Jack" caused all the talk.
It's just a copy of the way
I naturally walk.
'Cause I'm a jazz baby.
Little jazz baby, that's me.
Rock to sleep while the cradle went to and fro.
To and fro to the tune of the tickle-toe.
Ever since I started to grow love to hear the music playing, see my dear old mommy swaying.
Razz-ma-tazz, that's all I ever knew.
All day long
I would never get through.
Jazz-ma-tazz, that's all I want to do.
So play me a little jazz...
Jazz...
Baby...
Full of jazz-bo harmony.
The wailing of the saxes when those fellas go mad cannot compare with what
I got from Mommy and Dad.
So hear this jazz baby...
Miraculous!
Little jazz baby, that's me.
Swell! Just swell!
Everything's swell!
And you're just swell!
- Let's be kissy.
You like our place, do you?
- It's swell.
I can't wait to meet Mr. Van Hosmere.
- He went to his reward years ago.
You said "our place."
When I married Mr. Van Hosmere he was a widower.
I came to all this as the second Mrs. Van Hosmere, and I felt like a frozen quill in Queen Mary's behind.
But Mr. Van H. Just swiped me on the butt and said,
"Lady van Hosmere, it's our cottage.
Not my cottage, not yours, but ours.
Don’t you ever forget it!"
Unfortunately, I enjoyed him but for a brief but very ecstatic period.
Sad. - Yes, and Mr. Van H. Hated sad stories.
He wanted our place to be filled with good fun and good friends.
Despite the noble experiment we have a sufficiency of gin.
So drink up, everyone.
You're all invited to spend the night.
We have plenty of extra PJs.
Myself I sleep in the altogether.
Muzzy, you ought to be congratulated for the enchanting grab-bag of people.
It's so amusing to rub shoulders with all kinds.
And, darling, your ring!
How big is it?
About 2 quarts.
Raspberries! I've been waiting all evening for someone to ask.
I thought it was real.
- It is real. I had it drilled.
The mascara has run onto my brand-new dress from Paris!
Where? Don’t worry. I know something that cleans it.
You can't see a thing.
Soy sauce!
Soy sauce!
She's coloured my Paris gown with soy sauce.
Please, Miss Tremaine, I...
- You! You!
Inviting a stupid shop girl!
Miss Tremaine, if I could...
- Idiot!
Don’t you know anything?
Of course you don't!
I'll tell you what's going on around here, you boob!
Miss Tremaine.
I will take care of dress.
No, I'm going home.
Tea will show you out.
I'm sorry.
I thought it would clean it.
Honest. Mrs. Meers swears by it.
Holy mackerel.
A dress from Paris, France...
Let's go home.
We have to spend the night.
It's ceiling zero in New York.
Oh dear!
Don’t worry. It's like a film complete with a witch, Judith Tremaine.
You're laughing at me.
- No. - I don't blame you.
And like the films, there's a smash-bang happy ending.
I'll become the paper clip king, and
I'll hire you for my stenog.
I'd be your boss, and you'd be after me, and I'd say, "Sure, okay, grand."
How can you be a paper clip king, when you don't care a whit about work?
You haven't asked me about
Mr. Graydon's interest in paper clips.
You can't be happy-go-lucky all the time. Make something of yourself.
You're not getting any younger.
Maybe you should try gardening.
- They don't have stenogs.
Be serious.
What's to become of you?
Do you really care?
- Of course.
I like you.
And I like you, by jingo!
You've gotta show some get-up-and-go.
I'll bring our latest paper clips to show your boss next week.
Don’t. - What's the matter?
- I don't know. I feel...
So do I, Millie. You've unlocked a room in my heart.
Please, no.
- Millie.
Interesting.
While I'm thinking of it...
Supper in half an hour?
Hello, Millie.
Thank you, Juarez.
Sometimes I get the feeling
Juarez is going to bite me.
He's a dear butler. He's teaching me
Spanish and rope tricks and...
Moderns don't cry.
- No, of course not.
I must apologize for my guest.
Judith is a spoiled young lady.
Don’t let her upset you.
Muzzy, I'm so mixed up.
It's not only Miss Tremaine.
I am a working girl and a boob.
There's certainly nothing wrong with being a working girl.
I was a working girl in a chorus, but I wasn't a boob.
No, you married well, and that's exactly my plan.
Jimmy told me your plans.
Love has nothing to do with it?
I'm a modern.
- You're a boob.
But you...
- You're not going to believe me.
When I met Mr. Van H., I had no idea he was a multi-millionaire.
He was one of those darling daddies hanging around the stage door.
I mean, he didn't even look like a multi-millionaire.
And he drank beer.
Facts be known, I prefer beer.
He was a wonderful man.
Affection, that's what he had.
We became engaged, and he gave me a great big old green-glass brooch.
I leant it to my girlfriend so she could impress a new beau.
As fate would have it, he turned out to be a jeweller.
And the green glass turned out to be emeralds.
I truly prefer emeralds.
But I was upset.
I thought he had stolen it.
I begged him to take it back.
He just laughed and laughed.
Then he told me he really was a multi-millionaire, even if he didn't look like one, and we became married.
While I truly do prefer emeralds, we could've made it on green glass.
While I've been in the bleachers, you've been a player on the big field.
If it's marriage you've got in mind, love has everything to do with it.
Follow your heart.
No raspberries!
Jimmy, oh Jimmy.
Silly boy.
Gee, what a real swell guy.
Jimmy, oh Jimmy.
Oh, what joy.
He makes your troubles fly.
His glance has fireworks in it.
We kiss, my heart does a whiz-bang, flip-flop, heaven-for-a-minute.
Jimmy, oh Jimmy.
Don’t you know what I can't quite confess?
So coax me, implore me,
I promise you won't bore me.
Jimmy, I might say yes...
So coax me, implore me,
I promise you won't bore me.
Jimmy, I might...
Jimmy!
Get in here, little Miss Dorothy.
Good morning.
Hello, everybody.
Goodbye, darling.
We missed you at breakfast.
- I was in the gym.
Loosening up.
Always searching.
Cruncher, please meet
Millie, Miss Dorothy, Jimmy.
He saves his breath for the last round.
You're not to be strangers now.
The country club is giving a "Poor Man's Party."
We all get to wear rags. It should be worth it. Promise you'll come.
Thank you, but my weekends will be taken up with Mr. Trevor Graydon, my boss.
Perhaps we can motor down for golf.
He's very athletic, most mature, in contrast to the flighty boys one meets these days.
And the best-looking thing ever.
Yes, of course.
Okay, bye-bye, little Millie.
Promise you'll find your way back.
- Oh, Muzzy, you're so worthwhile.
She's been so stand-offish this morning.
Could be she has a hangover.
The bathtub-ring was still on that gin.
Goodbye, Mr. Smith.
It was an experience.
I'll call you.
Hey, Millie! Millie!
Millie?
Are you feeling quite well?
- Quite.
I thought your tummy was upset.
- The tummy isn't upset.
Good.
Something you'd like to tell me?
No, nothing on my conscience.
Perhaps there's something you'd like to tell me.
Well, Millie, I... No, not now.
- Yes, go on.
Well, I am terribly upset about my career.
Your career?
Yes, the world of the stage just doesn't seem to want me.
They don't know the real you.
Cut your hair.
Let them see how truly abandon you are.
Cut my hair?
I don't understand.
Oh, I couldn't...
People can't find you under the curls.
Good night. - But I...
Good night.
What? What is it?
- In my room...
Mrs. Meers!
Asleep in my room, on my bed!
She works a very long day, poor dear.
Well, good night.
Millie?
What am I going to do?
Oh dear.
Could I spend the night with you?
It'll give us a chance to talk.
If we're going to save our relationship, we need to talk.
Have I done something terrible to you?
Please tell me.
A girlfriend is very precious to me.
I don't want to lose you.
Oh no, you haven't done anything terrible to me.
After all, I have my plans and...
I'm sorry.
Your friendship is precious to me, too. You can spend the night.
Thank you.
But there'll be no more talk.
I'm not my brother's keeper, am I?
You can have the bed.
No!
- I insist. To make up for my lack of gypsy spirit.
You can't take the small town out of the girl.
Most irregular. I don't care how middle-class a place it is.
I really must callous up.
Starting tomorrow, I am going to be unspeakably fatal.
Mr. Graydon's office. Jimmy, you are always interrupting my life. Stop it!
What did I do? - I have work to do, and I presume you do, too.
Do it and leave me alone.
A day's work for a day's wage.
I didn't ask him to call.
I don't want him to call.
Good. Forget the boys.
Get yourself a canary.
Forget the boys.
Get yourself a man.
Do you have a mo?
- A what?
A moment?
I would love to get a man's opinion about Rudolph Valentino.
In "The Sheik" he takes Agnes Ayres by brute force.
And she enjoys it.
She enjoys it a lot.
What is your opinion of brute force?
I'm not for it.
Not at all.
Many women are unsettled.
Now they are disillusioned.
They are in for truth.
Give 'em a young man they can trust.
Tom Sawyer at 20.
I never read Tom Sawyer.
Was he... sexy?
He was only 12.
- When you've got, you've got it.
John!
- Yes, sir.
Take you to lunch?
- Mr. Smith!
You are not going to take me again ever, anywhere.
What did I do? What's wrong?
At least explain yourself.
Not on company time.
- What...
What lovely elbows you've got,
Miss Flannery.
From my mother's side of the family.
- Really?
The Bath girls were known for their elbows.
Out!
Seems I'm leaving.
Bye, Millie. Ouch.
John, be a swell scout. Ring up my club. A handball court for 6:15.
Yes, 6:15. - It'll work up a good sweat. Edgy in the gut, you know.
Edgy in the gut.
You want a pen?
- Yes, of course. To write a check.
Lady, it ain't that much.
How much?
- 25. - Thank you, Millie.
Oh, sweet mystery of life, at last I've found thee.
Oh, I know it's just the secret of it all.
All the longing, seeking, striving, waiting, yearning, the burning hopes, the joy and idle tears that fall...
Did I forget something?
This is my friend, Miss Dorothy Brown, from the hotel.
We were on our way to the Beauty Spot.
Miss Dorothy’s going to have her hair bobbed.
Bobbed? With your beauty?
Mr. Graydon. Behave.
I bet you could make the moon and the stars behave.
Miss Dorothy’s an actress.
The way the theatre’s so rotten...
You wouldn't rob some lucky stiff of playing with those adorable curls.
I just thought...
- Chuck it, John!
He calls me John...
- John, we're taking Miss Dorothy out.
And talk her out of doing mankind such a disservice.
Miss Dorothy, may I take the liberty of asking you to dine?
You may.
- But what about your sweat?
Cancel it.
Swell, just swell.
We'll have dinner, and afterwards a bit of vaudeville.
That is, if the comics aren't on.
Their humour can get too ribald.
I hate for you to cancel your plans with your gut so edgy.
On the other hand, it would certainly be fun.
Perfect. Although I'd feel more comfortable in a suitable frock.
We'll be gilding the lily.
But we'll stop by your hotel.
Taxi!
Terrif! My first date with Trevor Graydon. Come on.
Oh, hi there.
Goodness!
Ah, sweet mystery of life, at last I've found thee.
Oh, I know it's just the secret of it all.
Oh gosh! Bravo!
Raspberry!
My God, it's Muzzy!
What a full life she leads!
Oh, do it again!
I may say, "No, no, no, no, no."
But do it again.
My lips just ache to have you take the kiss that's waiting for you.
You know if you do you won't regret it.
Come and get it.
Oh, no one is there.
I may cry, "Oh, oh, oh..."
But no one will hear.
My mommy'd scold me,
'cause she told me it was naughty, but then, oh, do it again!
Please, do it again!
Searching, searching, searching!
Oh, Muzzy, we just loved you and the human yo-yo's.
Aren't they the sweetest people?
I was sure the Baron had done permanent damage to my inner ear.
The Bernini Brothers have worked miracles.
You were swell, just swell.
- Perfect.
I'm learning.
Hadn't we best be on our way?
Muzzy has to do her practicing.
I'm through for tonight.
You can take just so much yo-yo.
We really must be going.
Tomorrow's a working day.
Good night, Muzzy.
Swell, just swell.
Yes.
- Oh, Millie.
Would you mind assisting me with these little hooks?
Surely. I'll be right with you kids.
He's divine.
- Thank you.
I'm falling in love with him like you said was so important.
I had no idea they were such good friends.
Oh no, they only just met.
Such a baby!
It was his turn to undo me.
That Miss Dorothy!
Great Scot! That Miss Dorothy!
Pretty as a peach and skin to beat the band.
Perfect little pippin.
- Perfect.
What a dandy little bundle for a fella to cuddle.
Dandy.
Imagine all that sweetness in your arms?
I'll type up this survey report.
Original in five?
Don’t forget the dinner reservation at the Plaza.
Candle-nook room, quiet corner-table for two.
I think Miss Dorothy’s for the Plaza.
And John... flowers.
There's a florist just around the corner.
That's using the old bean, John.
Roses... pink... plump... long-stemmed... two dozen... in a vase.
Poor butterfly...
'neath the blossoms waiting.
Poor butterfly... for she loved him so.
Plaza Hotel, please.
Candlenook room.
The moments pass into hours.
The hours pass into years.
Mr. Trevor Graydon would like a quiet corner table for two.
Tonight, 7:30.
Thank you.
And as she smiles through her tears, she murmurs low,
"The moon and I know that he be faithful.
I know he'll come to me by and by."
Flowerbox, please.
"But if he don't come back,
Then I'll never sigh or cry."
Flowerbox? Mr. Trevor Graydon would like some roses.
2 dozen, long-stemmed, pink.
On the fat side.
I just must die, poor butterfly.
I run a no-nonsense organization!
I'll step the law on you.
This is not a hayloft!
Besides, she never wants to see you again. Youth today! Going to hell!
Never wants to see me again.
Banana oil!
Oh, honestly!
Sorry to bother you, but...
What is it you want?
- I'm looking for Millie Dillmount.
She's on the 20th floor.
Oh, thank you!
Judith Tremaine, fancy meeting you here!
Jimmy, you crazy kid!
Get in here!
Oh, wait! Wait!
It's stuck!
Push!
Millie?
Millie? You crazy kid!
I fell out.
- Hang on!
Stop!
Oh, there you are, Millie. Good.
Just another first.
Come on, Millie.
Hand over hand.
You're a whiz at it.
Gently now.
I have you.
You're home.
Thank you! Thank you!
Miss Flannery.
Yes?
- Excuse me.
Old elbow said you never wanted to see me again.
Well, I did say that.
But I am glad to see you.
I was feeling awfully blue.
You're a strange bird.
You look different.
- I lost my glasses.
You have nice eyes.
- Catch 'em by candlelight.
Have dinner with me.
Alright, but Dutch treat at the automat.
I'm leaving my job.
Mr. Graydon isn't available anymore.
Oh, corky!
He's lost his heart to a friend of ours.
Miss Dorothy?
- How'd you guess?
Who else do we both know? Muzzy?
- Don’t blame Miss Dorothy.
I really don't.
Mr. Graydon neither.
Love swamped them. We're too young to live a life of hate.
You're the one who should be on the stage. You're good.
You don't seem to care.
- I know.
You fickle Freddy.
Thank you!
- You're welcome.
John!
Your ex-lover.
- Coming, Mr. Graydon.
I'll pick you up at seven, and we aren't dining Dutch treat.
I'm taking you to Park Avenue for the best-fed picnic ever.
Nothing but the best for my date!
Seven then?
- Seven.
Bye.
- Bye.
Butterfly boy!
I may never go back to elevators again.
The lights have gone out of you.
- You pulled a switch.
Don’t you think washing dishes at the most expensive restaurant a lark?
We should have gone to the automat.
It's stealing when a person doesn't spend accordingly.
With his girlfriends a person should be honest.
You're a dabbler, playing footloose and fancy free to everyone, living moment to moment, never getting involved, throwing yourself away, and you could be something...
- Alright, call Miss Dorothy and ask her to bail us out.
- I'll do no such thing!
She's got the money. She's very rich.
- A fortune hunter to boot!
I'll pay it back.
- In paper clips?
I'm going to call her.
You're not having a lark.
Got a nickel?
- No!
The coffee klatsch is running out of cups.
I want you to take 'em that tray.
Now, snappy! Hop, hop, hop!
Good evening, you needed cups?
Over there, honey.
Mr. Graydon, I thought you were at the Candlenook Room.
She stood me up.
I went to the hotel. The lady at the desk said she'd checked out.
That's it.
No note, no forwarding address.
Nothing.
John, where is she?
I don't know.
How very strange!
I'll get you some more coffee.
Strong spirits!
- Not strong enough.
Just stop this. You'll upset that lovely system of yours.
Come meet Jimmy.
Perhaps he can figure it out.
Dear Miss Dorothy! Why should she slip away like that?
Come on.
Dorothy wouldn't leave without telling anyone her plans.
I spoke to her this afternoon.
- So did I.
Damn. I'm sorry, Millie.
But something's up.
You suspect foul play?
- I don't know.
Could you come up with a jack?
- Good as done.
I wanna search her room. Mrs. Meers isn't telling the whole story. C'mon.
You made it.
- I'm rarely a 2nd-story man.
I'd best call the police in on this.
Miss Brown certainly would have left a thank-you note for the flowers.
True. I wasn't at the desk at the time she left.
Let me check once again.
Excuse me.
I'm sure you've searched thoroughly, and I...
No, no, the young clerk is so careless.
The letter could be anywhere.
No one takes pride in their work.
Her checkbook.
She can't be far.
And all her clothes.
She checked out without saying a word?
A girl doesn't do that.
Ethel Peace did, and Fanny did.
Another girl when I first moved in.
Jimmy, all of them were here one day and gone the next.
Without a word to anyone...
Except Mrs. Meers.
Mrs. Meers! - Oh drat! Graydon was supposed to keep her occupied.
Quick, under the bed.
Another first.
Something fearful is happening.
The roses are doped.
The laundry men have been following Miss Dorothy.
Remember when you met us?
The laundry truck was up the street.
I'm afraid I only saw Dorothy.
The Chinese work for Mrs. Meers.
She's into something big.
What do all the missing girls have in common? Money?
Ethel Peace didn't have anything, no family, no friends. Neither did Fanny.
I've forgotten about what's-her-name.
She was all alone, poor thing.
Mrs. Meers said it to Miss Dorothy when she found out she was an orphan.
What? - "Sad to be all alone in the world."
Sad for the victim, but convenient for a vampire like Mrs. Meers.
You think that...
- I do.
You don't mean...
- I'm afraid.
By now she could...
- Yes.
Yes, Millie, true but cruel.
If a girl is all alone and checks out, who's to question her fate?
But Miss Dorothy’s not alone.
She has us.
That'll be 20, Miss.
- 20? - Cents, money.
Oh, 20.
Another Rockefeller.
What is it with you dames?
Well I seem to have forgotten my purse.
But well...
- Invest it for me. - Alright.
John, snap to.
Let's get organized.
- Yes, sir.
Any mail for me?
It's too early for mail.
You know that.
Hello, I'm Millie Dillmount.
I'm Mary James. I'm new here.
I hope we'll be friends.
So do I.
I don't know a soul in New York.
I don't know a soul anywhere.
Except at the orphanage.
Oh, sad to be all alone in the world.
12th floor, dear.
- I'll show you the way.
Pity!
Well, thank you. I'll see you.
- Yes, alright.
Millie?
Oh, isn't Miss Dorothy here?
No, I'm sorry. She's moved.
- Gee, that's too bad.
I wanted to show her how it turned out.
Apparently just splendid.
- Not bad.
Not bad at all.
- I thought they were fine, but Dickie likes jazz babies with fronts.
As soon as that clot proposes, out comes the cotton.
See you in the shower.
Millie?
Is everything all right?
- Yes, thank you, Mrs. Meers.
This is for you.
I made them up for all you girls.
I can't wait to get acquainted, not having folks or friends.
Of course.
Now everything seems to be in order.
Envelopes, stationery...
There's a lovely pen in the drawer, too.
If there's anything else you need just let me know.
I'll leave now, dear.
So you can relax.
Hey, Graydon.
He's a healthy young animal, but he has the instincts of a gentleman. I thought he'd ask me, but he says, "I'll take a kiss."
I say, "Take a kiss, and lose a lip."
So he got fresh and lost a lip.
I said, "See you in church" and turned on the lights.
See you later.
- Yes, bye.
Hey, Zelda.
I got some lips last night.
Hey, take a look at Miss America.
You like it?
I love you, too, you funny nut.
Jimmy?
Jimmy, you're not pretending.
Mr. Graydon!
Jimmy! Come on! Come on!
She's not much, but a little dark corner on the late, late shift.
Mr. Graydon,
Jimmy's in the laundry basket.
The laundry men.
Mr. Graydon!
I must speak to the Buddha.
Mrs. Meers.
Act like nothing happened.
Don’t look now.
You see that laundry truck?
Follow it.
Mr. Graydon, you're letting it get away.
Mr. Graydon! ...Oh, Jimmy!
Buddha? Meers here.
In front of the hotel, a dark man in a red roadster. Remove him.
No!
Now.
That's the starter.
That's the gas.
There's the break.
I hope.
Stop!
Stop! Millie!
Taxi! Stop!
Taxi!
Just another first.
I... beg your pardon. I'm looking for a young man wearing a dress.
Jimmy!
Jimmy?
Oh, Jimmy, darling.
Jimmy, wake up, dear.
But I don't have a nickel.
Not even my checkbook.
Borrow? I believe you've never been in a Chinese opium den.
Oh dear!
Dorothy!
- Miss Dorothy!
Help!
Somebody, please! Help!
Miss Dorothy!
- Help!
Miss Dorothy!
Miss Dorothy!
Jimmy!
Untie the others.
Hide until the police come.
I'm Millie Dillmount. Have you seen
2 Chinese and a girl?
A boy? A very tall girl? Miss Dorothy?
She's lovely with brown curls.
Yes, they're over there.
- Good. Help me untie the others!
Miss Dorothy!
Did they have their way with you?
Well, really! Millie!
My beauty spot!
Don’t tell me you weren't busy.
Where is he?
Come on!
Faster!
Hope he won't be an addict with all that dope.
It didn't hurt Sleeping Beauty or Snow White.
That way.
Put him in the rumble seat.
Trevor.
Front seat's taken.
Hey, money bags!
That's the gas...
No, forward, dear.
- I know.
Oh, it's Mrs. Meers.
Maybe she'd like a lift.
Get in!
After them!
Snap to! Let's get organized!
Aha, heading for Long Island and their rich society friends.
The four-hundreds could be missing a few.
My God, you two are dreary.
Your adventure sends a chill over my heart.
To think of such ungentlemanly behaviour in my darling New York.
Millie, I lift my glass in humble tribute.
A miracle the way you rebuffed those fatheads.
Everyone of them must die.
How do you thank a hero?
I saved you selfishly for myself.
First that interfering
Dillmount girl!
Shall we join the others? Please.
Shall we join the others?
Good evening.
Raspberry.
Wonderful!
Perfect!
Me?
Please, don't think this frivolous.
Perfect!
Muzzy, honestly, you were...
My law instructors are arriving.
My rock.
Sad to be all alone in the world.
Oh, Jimmy, darling.
Get in here, Muzzy, you...
Muzzy, too?
Sure, you wanna join me?
And my sister and my stepmother.
Sister, stepmother?
- Though she's not old enough to be.
I've been blind.
- No, Jimmy is like his father.
He didn't look like a real multi-millionaire either.
You're not in paper clips?
- That's not far from the truth.
The fortune was founded in steel.
Oh, I don't understand.
Judith Tremaine chased Jimmy, and every fortune hunter chased Dorothy.
I sent the children out into the real world with high hopes they'd come back with sweet partners. And they did.
Your father would be so proud of you.
Jimmy, off with the mask.
James van Hosmere, 1st Vice President of Van Hosmere Worldwide Enterprises.
You do have nice eyes.
- Be my stenog?
I don't want to be your equal.
I want to be a woman, a dandy little bundle to cuddle.
You think Miss Dorothy has curls?
You wait.
What's the final word, Tea?
I've been watching her most close.
I approve.
A good old-fashion girl.
Tea practically raised me.
So that does it. Almost.
What do you want for a wedding present?
A checkbook.
Rich people can nickel and dime me to death.
Swell.
- Just swell.
Oh, this is my... what do you teach?
Like a squirrel, storing the nuts of life.

Hey, what do you suppose she's trying to tell us?
I don't know, but whatever it is,
I'm listening.
Hey, Teddy!
Judd!
How are you, old buddy?
Great. It's nice of you to go to all this trouble.
Dancing girl, a band playing.
It's quite a reception.
Well, it would've been better if you told me you were coming.
Now, how long you gonna be in town?
Oh, just a few days.
Our ship's in the bay.
You, uh, you still deactivating those floating mines?
Yeah.
That's like playing underwater Russian roulette.
Do you expect to be a frogman all your life?
Frogman? Please.
It's explosive- ordnance-disposal man.
And the answer to your question is no.
What does that mean?
I'm practically a civilian.
Hey, that's great, man.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Anything but go back in this racket with you.
Oh, now, wait a minute, all right.
We didn't make much money, but we turned out some of the most beautiful sounds you ever heard.
Now, what do you say?
Thanks, but no, thanks.
I want you to meet my buddies.
Ensigns Tompkins and Whitehead,
Lieutenant Schwartz.
This is Judd.
Hi, fellas.
How are you?
I want you to meet the band.
Hey, guys!
I want you to--
Are you the same guys that were here yesterday?
You forgot the organ grinder.
Oh, no, no, no.
She doesn't swing.
She just likes to dance.
She comes down to rehearsals because she figures it's good exercise--yoga.
You could still introduce us.
Yeah, we haven't seen anything like that since we shipped out.
How long you been out to sea?
3 days.
3 whole days?
Hey, Jo, come here a minute.
Come here.
I want you to meet a good friend of mine.
Lieutenant Ted Jackson and his outfield.
Tompkins, Whitehead, and Schwartz.
Hi.
I'm Schwartz.
And you are the living end.
Ah, thank you.
You got to watch out for him.
He's a real recruiter.
And not just for the Navy.
Mm, thanks for the warning.
But take me.
I'm an underwater barnacle scraper.
Relatively harmless.
I think I'd feel safer with Schwartz, but I'll let you know if I ever have any barnacles that need scraping.
See you around, fellas.
Did you hear that?
Safer with Schwartz.
If that gets around, it'll ruin my reputation.
You were right, Judd.
She doesn't swing, not for me, anyway.
Well, there are other numbers on the wheel of fortune, pal.
You still got the thing with the phone numbers on it?
You kiddin'?
When it comes to women,
I always leave it to lady luck.
Well, come on, Judd.
Break it out for my friends.
Well, now, wait a minute.
I don't know.
I just added some new blood.
Be a sport. We've been out of touch.
It's the least you can do for an old partner.
Well, all right, but I wouldn't do this for anybody else.
Come on, you guys.
All right, fellas, break it up.
They want to see the wheel.
Wait till you see it.
You won't believe it.
You guys ready?
Yeah, we have been.
Ok, are the doors locked?
Here we go.
It's a wheel!
With girls!
Wait a minute.
Hold it, now, hold it.
Phone numbers!
Back up, step down, and stand aside and let the man tell you all about it.
Ok, boys!
* Step right up
* To the love machine
* You may get lucky
* Win yourself a dream
* Let the wheel
Go round *
* Round and round
* Well, you may win
That girl *
* You never found
* She may be Suzy
* Or Mabeline
* She could be Cathy
* Or Angeline
* Now let the wheel
Go round *
* Round and round
And round and round *
* Round and round
* Round and round
And round and round *
* Try your luck
Right now *
* On the love
Machine *
* We're just a bunch
Of salty sailors *
* With one thing
On our minds *
* Takin' a chance
On this machine *
* Maybe love we'll find
* She may be tall,
She may be short *
* She may be wide
* But, lady luck,
Stop that wheel *
* On 38-24-35
* Step up
* Who's next in line
* For this love machine?
* Don't waste no time
* Let the wheel go round
* Round and round
And round and round *
* Round and round
* Round and round
And round and round *
* What will your fortune be
On the love machine? *
All right.
* We're just a bunch
Of salty sailors *

On the love machine? *
Hey!
Hey!
Do you suppose I could have another--
Aw, no, no, no.
Wait a minute.
Only one to a customer.
That's all. One.
No, no.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Oh, it's a beautiful morning.
What's so beautiful about it?
Don't tell me you picked a winner last night.
A winner? This girl was the grea--
I mean, she was so-- well, she was absolutely... a dog.
Yeah, struck out, too, eh?
What I thought was her phone number turned out to be her statistics--
Yeah, I think Judd's wheel is rigged.
My girl was 38-24-38.
What's wrong with that?
It added up to her age.
Now, that's the way to go to sea.
Small craft approaching off the port bow, sir.
Very well.
Steady as you go.
Steady as you go.
All engines back full.
All engines back full.
All engines back full, aye, sir.
Sound short blasts.
Say, lady, that was a dangerous thing to do.
Your boat's bigger than mine.
You have to watch out for me.
Well, you got to admit, she's got a logical mind.
And a fantastic body.
Too bad, Marty. Your girl didn't show up.
Hey, there's a guy onboard.
Yeah, and I wish it was me.
If I could live like that,
I'd give this Navy up tomorrow.
You are giving it up, remember?
No.
They're giving me up.
My tour of duty is over.
Not yet.
Going-away gift from the skipper.
It's an E.O.D. assignment.
Where is it?
Coast guard picked up a sonar contact near Rocky Point.
They think it's a mine.
Mine? In these waters?
Better suit up. We'll be there in a half hour.
Tell Cooper to break out the aluminum tanks.
See you later, fellas.
It's an old magnetic mine, all right.
Foreign. I think we should take it back to the base.
Probably dropped off a sub.
We'd better disarm it underwater.
Ok, lieutenant, but don't take any unnecessary chances.
That hazardous-duty pay won't do you much good if you're not around to collect it.
Thanks, Cooper.
I'll keep that in mind.
I'll pull on my marker buoy when it's safe and I'm coming up.
You clear out of the area.
Lieutenant, I'm supposed to stay here with you.
Better get going.
This is where he was dropped off.
Wonder why they went off and left him.
Maybe they don't like him.
Must be something dangerous down there.
Nah. What could be dangerous down there?
Well, why don't you go down and find out?
Get that boat out of here.
Ok!
Go on, Gil, you can go overboard without them seeing you, and then I'll circle around and pick you up later.
Come on, look, you can't fool around with the Navy.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Get that boat out of here!
This is a restricted area!
All right!
Go on, Gil.
What's the matter, are you scared?
No, I'm not, but why should I get wet just to satisfy your curiosity?
Are you afraid of mussing your hair?
I'll bring back a picture of that frogman for your collection.
Ohh.
Get that boat out of here!
You heard me!
Get it out of here!
Where's that Navy boat?
Over there heading towards us.
Let's get out of here.
Hey, look!
Hey, give me a hand.
Ok, there were radio warnings.
This area was restricted.
What's the big idea?
Oh, I never listen to the radio.
Too many commercials.
Vicki, Mary, give me a hand.
You trying to tell me that you're the skipper?
Well, I give the orders, if that's what you mean.
Is the mine safe now?
Well, I'm not worried about the mine. I'm worried about you.
Did you order him to take my picture?
That stunt can get you in a lot of trouble.
Look, that's all it was--just a stunt.
We're not enemy spies or anything so romantic.
Just old friends out for a few laughs.
You can understand that.
Oh, I understand.
I saw you earlier.
Give me that film.
Give it to him, Gil.
Well, now that we're friends, how about a martini?
You sure know how to hurt a guy, don't you?
Thanks, but some other time when I'm not working.
Hey, Cooper, catch.
Hold it steady.
See you around, folks.
Too bad we didn't get to keep his picture.
Yeah, too bad.
Ohh.
Say, Cooper, what would happen if you found something of value while on duty?
Why? What'd you find, lieutenant?
I found a million dollars in gold on an old shipwreck.
Sure you did.
Well, I can dream, can't I?
Really, what would happen if you did find something?
I think it belongs to the Navy if you tell them about it, but I'm not sure if that includes girls.
All hands, man the air valves!
Start the compressors!
Lower away!
Steady as she goes.
Careful now.
Don't foul my air line.
That's it.
You're doing fine, boys.
Let her down easy.
We're nearing the bottom.
Take it easy, everybody.
Steady, steady.
Eureka!
We've hit the bottom!
Ahoy!
Oh, it's beautiful down here.
The fish are just sailing by.
Some of the species
I've never seen before.
And the atmosphere is perfectly wonderful.
It's beautiful down here.
Positively beautiful.
Don't foul that air line.
Steady, boys, steady.
Come in.
Captain Jack?
Yeah, I'm Captain Jack.
Sorry. I couldn't wait until you surfaced to talk with you.
I, uh, I didn't know anyone was watching.
That's quite a gadget.
Yes, yes, indeed.
I get a great deal of enjoyment out of this.
At the moment,
I'm quite embarrassed.
I've never done this in public before.
You're not gonna dive in that, are you?
Oh, no, no.
I wouldn't have the nerve to actually dive.
But I'd like to, so I pretend.
It's just a little game.
I try to do everything as realistic as possible.
Would you help me off with that back there?
Certainly.
Aren't you in the wrong business?
No, no, certainly not.
I've been collecting information on salvaging for 20 years.
I'm really quite an authority, you know.
That's why I'm here.
I've been asking around, and I heard that you were the man to see.
Yes, sir. I am definitely the man to see.
About what?
I want to know about a ship that went down off the point around the turn of the century.
You have indeed come to the right man.
Great many ships went down in these rough waters, as you can see from this geodetic survey map.
It's upside down, captain.
You are very observant.
The Sicilian-- the Gauntlet in 1880--
I'm interested in a ship named the Port of Call.
Port of Call?
There she is.
A beautiful brigantine.
I knew the skipper's son very, very well.
There she is.
Like a Sleeping Beauty waiting for her Prince Charming.
Mm-hmm.
Of course, the map could be wrong.
The location is a theory based entirely on old lighthouse records.
Do you know where these records are?
Yes. The skipper's only living relative Jo Symington has them.
Where can I find this Symington?
In a big old house at the end of Silver Canyon.
Name is on the mailbox.
You can't miss it.
One last thing, captain.
Have you got any idea what the ship was carrying when she went down?
Oh, yes.
Jo told me.
Come on down here.
Shh shh shh.
The Port of Call was carrying something very valuable from the Argentine.
A treasure.
Yeah?
Or was it bananas?
No. No.
That was the Gauntlet.
I remember it now.
The Port of Call had a cargo of... coconut oil.
Coconut oil?
Or perhaps it was tea.
I think I better see this Joe Symington.
Yeah, I think you'd better.
Thanks a lot, captain.
You've been a great help.
Oh, it's perfectly all right.
Anything for the Navy.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, just a minute.
Uh, you're not gonna tell anybody anything about my little diving game, are you?
No. I won't talk if you won't.
Oh, I won't.
I don't want it to get around that I'm asking about the Port of Call.
Top secret. So keep it under your helmet, all right?
Mum's the world.
Double mum.
Yeah. Thanks.
Now from the lotus, we serenely flow into the attitude of the dancing Shiva.
Develop our equilibrium.
Oh, uh, yes.
Yes.
Now breathe in... and breathe out.
I'm looking for Joe Symington.
Go away. This is for members only.
How do I join?
You can start by taking your clothes off.
What?
Just a minute.
Now take your clothes off and put these on.
Where?
Right around the corner, and be very quiet.
Breathe in... and out.
Now exhale.
More. Get it all out.
More.
And once more the dancing Shiva.
I'd like to talk to, uh--
Shh.
I'd like to talk to Joe Symington.
You can't until yoga class is over.
I haven't got time.
Come on, make the scene or split. Dig?
I don't know anything about yoga.
Who does?
Uh, excuse me, uh--
Young man, you are causing ripples on the waters of peace and contentment.
I didn't mean to make waves, but I'm looking for somebody.
We are all searching for someone, yearning to communicate across a void of spiritual isolation.
Now, what we are concerned with here are the means.
And now, young man, either shape up or ship out.
If you'll just--
Sit down!
Yes, sir.
Uh, ma'am.
What do you know?
The barnacle scraper.
Hi.
We will now once more attempt to attain that state of tranquillity before we were so rudely interrupted.
I'm sorry.
And now the spinal twist.
The spinal twist.
Now hold and meditate.
Uhh. Not that way.
Arch your back and lock your arm around your knee.
Like this.
Maybe I better just ship out.
Well, you are in the Navy, aren't you?
I may be 4F after this.
Well, good. You can go back to work for Judd.
He likes offbeat talent.
I can see that.
My picture and numbers aren't on his wheel of fortune, if that's what you mean.
Now back to the lotus.
Who are you looking for?
Joe Symington.
Do you know him?
He's me.
What?
Josephine.
You're Jo Symington?
Dear man, I have tried very hard to be patient with you, but if you continue to disrupt my class with your chattering,
I shall be forced to clobber you on the cruller!
Can we go someplace and talk?
Sure. Come on.
* Well, I can see that you
And yoga *
* Will never do
* Yoga is as yoga does
* There's no in-between
* You're either with it,
On the ball *
* Or you've blown
The scene *
* I can see,
Looking at you *
* You just
Can't get settled *
* How can I even move
* Twisted like a pretzel?
* Yoga is as yoga does
* There's no in-between
* You're either with it
All the way *
* Or you've blown
The scene *
* Or you've blown
The scene *
* Come on, come on,
Untwist my legs *
* Pull my arms a lot
* How did I
Get so tied up *
* In this yoga knot?
* You tell me just how I
* Can take this yoga
Serious *
* When all it ever
Gives to me *
* Is a pain
In my posterius? *
* Yoga is as yoga does
* There's no in-between
* You're either with it
All the way *
* Or you've blown
The scene *
* Or you've blown
The scene *
* Stand upside down,
On your head *
* Feet against the wall
* A simple yoga exercise
* Done by one and all
* Now cross your eyes
And hold your breath *
* Look just like a clown
* Yoga's sure to catch you
* If you come fallin' down
* Yoga is as yoga does
* There's no in-between
* You're either with it
All the way *
* Or you've blown
The scene *
* Or you've blown
The scene *
Beautiful!
That really grooves.
Man, that turns me on.
It's a form of art.
It's called a "happening."
Looks more like a smashup in an Italian restaurant.
It's too much.
Crazy.
What's that?
Watch.
What's going on?
Some kind of new group therapy?
No. We're just a bunch of people who like to live a free life.
Artists and sculptors, they come here because it's remote and it's beautiful, a perfect place to be alone and--
Paint with spaghetti and girls.
People always make fun of things they don't understand.
It's human nature.
Oh, I understand spaghetti.
I even eat it.
I just don't understand it as a shampoo.
I'll admit some of the work they do is pretty wild, but it's a sincere attempt to break loose from convention.
They're doing that, all right.
But you haven't told me what brings you here.
I'm doing a manual on early sea disasters.
I was told you might be able to help me.
Who told you?
Captain Jack.
That old phony. He can't keep anything to himself.
I'm interested in one ship in particular-- the Port of Call.
You aren't the first one.
I've had hundreds of get-rich-quick creeps asking about my grandfather's ship.
Come on.
This is more like I expected.
This was my father's room.
It's the only one I haven't redecorated I nearly far-out.
It's beautiful.
Thank you. Well, what would you like to know?
Captain Jack says you have some lighthouse records.
That's right.
It was the lighthouse keeper who saw the Port of Call go down.
That's how we know where she is.
Why are fortune hunters after the ship?
Coconut oil would be pretty rank after all this time.
Coconut oil?
The Port of Call was carrying coffee... and a chest filled with Spanish pieces of eight.
Well, there are a lot of rumors about old ships and sunken treasure.
I'm afraid I'd be more interested in historical fact.
Oh, this isn't just a rumor. It's true.
It says so right here on the manifest.
I got it from the shipping company.
Hmm.
Interesting.
Very interesting.
I'm glad you're interested in history and not money.
I don't know how to thank you.
You've been an awful lot of help.
Just let me read the manual when you finish writing it.
Sure. You'll be the first one.
And come back anytime.
Next week, we're having a real bash-up here.
Bring your own spaghetti?
Next week, it's cold beet borscht with sour cream.
I'll try to make it.
Thanks again.
Well, is it official?
Yup.
Congratulations, civilian.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Jo told you all that?
She showed me the manifest.
It has the exact description of the chest I saw in the wreck.
Listen, baby, that's an awful lot of strain just for a bunch of old pesos.
Judd, those old pesos are probably solid silver and worth about $30 apiece to a collector.
There may be thousands of them in that chest.
All right, so it's a lot of bread, but it's still gamble time.
Look, life's a gamble.
I'm willing to put up every dime of my terminal leave pay-- a thousand bucks.
You should put up at least the same to help pay for the boat and equipment.
You sure you just weren't high on rapture of the deep?
I might have been, if the ship was where the map said it went down, but the tide must have broken it up and carried this section of hull into shallower water.
I don't know.
That underwater jazz.
All them things with the big eyes and jellyfish.
Look, all you have to do is handle the boat while I'm down below.
What do you say?
Your half will set you up solid for life.
My half?
Well, what about Jo?
After all, it's her grandfather's boat.
It's not a job for a girl, but we do need to hire another guy to handle the winches and the compressor.
Now, what do you say?
You with me, or do I have to get
2 other guys?
All right. All right,
I'll go along. One condition.
What's that?
If we blow it, you come back here, work at your old salary.
You used to pay me off in warm beer.
I'll throw in an ice cube.
It's a lousy deal, but I accept.
A lousy--for who?
How do I know if you can still turn that crowd on?
Give me an intro.
You're on, buddy.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a nice surprise for you.
An old friend of mine, as a matter of fact, my ex-partner, just out of the service and a fine singer, will favor us with a tune.
So how about a nice round of applause for Ted Jackson?
Ok, Ted, what are you gonna sing?
Stop!
You're wrong again!
And a-1 and a-2 and a-3 and a-4 and the spot.
* Baby, you've been
Lying to me *
* Now I'm onto you
* It's the same old song
* But it doesn't ring true
* That's right
* You're wrong again
* Time to change and put
You on your own again *
* You've
* Had your way too long
* Time for me to be Moving on *
* You got to stop
* You're wrong again
* Stop
* That song again
* You've been stepping out
* Out and fancy-free
* Now you've had your fun
* And you're running
Back to me *
* It just can't be
If there's no harmony *
* Then stop
* That's all
* Let's break it up
* You had me fooled,
Now I'm waking up *
* I see right through
Your lie *
* You made me
Open my eyes *
* You got to stop
* You're wrong again
* Stop
* That song again
* It's too late now
* I've made up my mind
* Being here with you was
Just a waste of time *
* Nothing to say,
So I'll be on my way *
* Stop
* You got to stop
* You're wrong again
* Stop
* That song again
* It's too late now
* I've made up my mind
* Being here with you
* Was just a waste of time
* It just can't be
If there's no harmony *
* Then stop
* Stop
* You're wrong again
* Stop
* That song again
* Stop
* You're wrong again
* You got to stop
* That song again
* Stop
Hey, baby!
All right!
We're gonna do a little dancing now!
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, don't tell me this is in the line of duty.
Not to the Navy.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Didn't recognize you with your clothes on.
Hmm. I wasn't sure it was you either without your photographer.
I'm Dina Bishop.
Miss Dina Bishop.
Ted Jackson.
Mr. Ted Jackson.
I keep forgetting that you can call a naval officer "mister."
I'm not exactly in the Navy anymore.
Oh? I hope my little stunt didn't get you fired.
That had nothing to do with it.
I'm just not on active duty.
Well, great.
That means you'll be around her more often.
All the time.
Would I still be hurting a guy if I offered to buy him a martini?
I think I could stand the pain.
Look, the Navy paid me to take risks.
What makes you stick your neck out?
I collect excitement the way most people collect stamps or butterflies.
I prefer people.
Oh, so do I-- exciting ones.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Well, if it isn't the minesweeper.
No pictures, please.
Come on, Dina.
Let's get out of here.
I'm not through with my drink yet.
I'll buy you a drink someplace else. Come on.
I said later, Gil.
She said later, Gil.
You stay out of it, frogman, or I'll do more than just take your picture.
What'd you have in mind?
What'd you do that for?
Oh, I just can't stand seeing grown men fight, unless it's over me.
And besides, it's time to go home, and I promised you'd drive me.
Who'd you promise?
Me. Come on. Let's go.
She saved him from getting his teeth knocked out.
She saved somebody.
Hold it.
Thank you.
You know, I can't decide if I like you better in uniform or out.
You worry about how your
Christmas gifts are wrapped?
It's what's inside that counts.
We're a little early for Christmas, aren't we?
Don't you be a last-minute shopper.
Uh, by the way, whatever happened to that manual you started to write?
Oh, I gave it up with my active status.
Always use your shoes for a purse?
Well, it's better than wearing them.
I mean, they're just another hang up of the modern world.
And besides, I like the feel of things against my feet.
Wet sand and grass.
Even carpeting.
It's as though my fingers can't feel enough, and they need my toes to help.
You know something?
We have more in common than I thought.
What are you going to do now?
Right now?
No, I mean, now that the Navy doesn't take all of your time.
I'd rather talk about what we're gonna do.
Well, I don't know about you, but I'm gonna stand on my head.
Stand on your head?
Uh... don't you think you're taking this yoga thing a little too far?
It helps me relax.
Would you like to join me?
No, I think I'll sit this one out.
No guts, huh?
What are you doing tomorrow?
What do you have in mind?
I just thought you might like to join our poetry reading.
Well, uh,
I'm gonna be pretty busy for the next couple of days, planning for the future and everything.
How long do you keep this up?
3 or 4 hours-- till I get sleepy.
3 or 4 hours.
Well, I wouldn't want to keep you awake.
Good night.
Good night.
Thanks for bringing me home.
Any time.
This is the most exciting morning of my life.
I'm actually going for a real treasure.
I've dreamed of this for years.
And you'll have really made it happen.
I'm terribly grateful to you two gentlemen.
You did your share,
Captain Jack.
Without this equipment, we couldn't have made it.
The only thing we could afford to do was rent this boat and the scuba gear.
The sea breeze, the ocean air, the lure of adventure.
The bounding main.
Hey, what's the matter?
I--I think I'm sick.
Sick? We haven't even cast off yet.
Oh, I'm frightened of water.
They call it hydrophobia.
Hydrophobia, that's when you foam at the mouth.
I think he's going to.
I thought you were a sea captain.
Well, I had a TV kiddies adventure program on Saturday mornings.
I was the captain of the good ship Lollipop.
Get me off!
Let's get him off.
Get me off!
Get me off!
Ok, ok. Don't look down.
Don't look down.
I gotcha.
Here. There you go.
Those kiddies believed all my sea stories, and I tried, but it was always the same.
I could never make it past the breakwater.
Uh, captain, the breakwater's right over there.
The breakwater.
He's beautiful.
Well, I guess we better unload this, huh?
No. No, no, no, no.
Uh, you can use the equipment.
I'll just charge you by the hour.
It won't do us any good.
We need a third man to help.
Hi, fellas!
Hi, Jo!
What are you doing?
Well, we're just getting ready to-- do a little fishing!
Fishing? But we're supposed to rehearse.
We're gonna rehearse later, hon.
Great. I'll go with you.
Fine! Come on!
Hey, help me cover this stuff, will ya?
What'd you do that for?
Well, you said you needed a third--
A man, not a girl, especially not that girl.
Why not that girl?
I told you. She thinks
I'm interested in history, not sunken treasure.
Hey, this is a wild idea.
Hello, Jo.
Captain Jack.
Is anything wrong?
Oh, nothing's wrong.
He's got hydrophobia, but he won't bite.
Jo, it was nothing.
Just another acute attack of cowardice.
I'll be all right in a month or two.
Can I get you anything?
A glass of water?
Oh, no, no.
Not water!
Come on, then I'll help you back to the shop.
Good idea.
Help him back.
Wait for me.
No, never mind about me.
You go, go have a good time.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Look, Jo, we may be out all day.
Oh, wonderful.
I brought my lunch.
5 raw carrots and a jar of prune yogurt.
Prune yogurt--yecch!
I'll cast off the lines.
It won't work, Judd.
It just won't work.
Who else you gonna get?
And who deserves a split more than she does?
Ok. But we better wait till we're out there before we deal her in.
She may not be too happy
I didn't tell her about it in the first place.
Stern line's clear.
Thank you.
Hope you feel better, captain.
Well, if I'm not, don't bury me at sea.
Well, now is as good a time as any.
Look, tell her about the loot. Build it up.
Every chick I've ever known digs money.
Take over, will you?
I want to talk to you.
Sure.
You want a carrot?
No, thanks. The only way
I like them is in tzimmes.
What?
Navy talk.
Jo, we're not going fishing.
We're not?
There's something I should have told you earlier, but, uh... now that I've waited so long, it's kind of rough.
Watch it, Judd.
Sorry, Ted.
Diving gear?
Hey, wait a minute.
You were right. This wasn't any fishing trip.
I can explain it to you.
You don't have to.
I think I get the picture.
Jo, I found a part of your grandfather's ship, the part with the chest in it.
That's why you came around asking questions.
There wasn't any Navy manual.
You're nothing but a get-rich-quick creep like all the rest.
Tell her about 1/3!
We plan to give you a share, but we need your help.
Help?
You brought me out here thinking I'd go along with this?
It was your idea to come out here with us, remember?
You even brought your lunch.
Hey, look!
What do you think they want?
I'm not sure, but there's a guy onboard who took my picture while
I was deactivating that mine.
Took your picture?
For what?
They were playing games.
He might have seen the wreck while he was down there.
I don't know.
So what do we do now?
Now we sit here and fish.
Ahoy there.
Where you headed?
Nowhere.
Just doing a little fishing.
What about you?
Oh, we're leaving.
On our way to Baja California.
I didn't want to go without saying good-bye.
Thank you.
Have a nice trip.
Thank you.
Kind of funny, you stopping out here to fish.
What's so funny about it?
How come you're the only one fishing?
Hey, what are you, the game warden?
What are you trying to prove, Gil?
Nothing.
It seems funny, that's all.
Hold it here a minute, will you?
Dina, come here.
I want to show you something.
Look at this.
I was getting a little worried there, buddy.
That cat looked like he was hip to what we're doing.
I hope they're getting ready to leave.
We won't have too much daylight left as it is.
What do you say we be realistic about this?
I'm not talking to you.
Let's not be childish.
I'm not being childish.
I'm just bugged.
You come on like we're robbing a bank.
Well, that's just the way you're acting.
This is stupid. Look, you give your share to charity or whatever you want to, but help us bring it up.
All right, I will, if you give your share to charity.
Fine. My favorite charity is me.
That is not what I meant.
We could use the money to set up an art center where my friends could live and study and improve their work.
Those kooks?
They are not kooks.
They're serious artists who just need a decent place to work.
Is it a deal?
Not that way.
You get a third,
I get a third, and Judd gets a third.
Mexican stand-off.
You're just being hardheaded.
Maybe, but I've got principles, and that's something you wouldn't understand.
Hey, we're in trouble!
You have to help us!
What's the matter?
Battery cables are busted.
Battery cable? You have
2 engines, don't you?
Both cables are shot!
How can both cables wear out at the same time?
Just unlucky, I guess.
You'll have to tow us in, Ted.
Yeah. Rule of the sea, you know.
Ok. Throw us a line.
Thanks for the lift.
Sorry we spoiled your fishing.
Forget it. They weren't biting anyway.
Well, it won't be so bad, you singing in my place.
It'll be like old times.
We're not through yet.
We'll come back tomorrow.
Not with me you won't.
You still won't settle for a third?
Why should I settle for a third when I can go for broke?
What does that mean?
Well, I know where it is now, don't I?
And, after all, it was on my grandfather's ship.
You don't have the equipment to go treasure-hunting on your own.
Besides, we're gonna get there first.
Well, I can try.
And even if I don't stand a chance,
I wouldn't help you for anything in the world.
Ok. So I'm an unprincipled, get-rich-quick creep.
Aside from that,
I'm not all bad.
I'll keep your secret.
Look, would you like me any better if I hated money, grew a beard, and stood on my head?
Any change would be an improvement.
Man, that girl is stubborn.
Listen, I'll talk to her later for you.
I understand women, you know.
If you do, you're the first.
Avast, you lubbers!
Rig the mainsails, or I'll keelhaul the lot of ya!
We've got to ride out this storm!
This storm is turning into a hurricane!
Let her blow, boys!
Let her blow!
Ahoy there, all my little shipmates in TV land!
Huh, that was quite a storm we were through.
Captain Jack is here again this morning for Zelda's cornmeal mush--
Ha ha ha.
I'm, uh, ha ha, just rehearsing a television show
I--I used to have.
I was always a stickler for realism.
The kids loved it.
Television show.
Yes.
Don't you recognize me?
Captain Jack of the good ship Lollipop.
Remember?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
You're Captain Jack?
Yes. Didn't you ever see the show?
Are you kidding?
I saw it all the time and so did all my kids.
We never missed it.
How wonderful.
Well, I'm very, very flattered.
It's a pleasure to meet you, captain.
Oh, thank you very much.
Uhh!
Oh, I'm awful sorry.
I really didn't mean to do that.
That's all right.
But it just can't be.
I mean, you couldn't be the same Captain Jack.
The same?
What do you mean?
Well, your name was on their equipment.
I just couldn't believe that my kids' Captain Jack was a part of their dirty scheme.
Well, friend,
I don't follow you.
The scheme to cheat me out of my salvage.
You mean you found the treasure?
Treasure?
Do you mind?
Uh, certainly.
Of course I found the treasure.
What do you think?
And you're in on it with them.
Oh, you know, I don't know how to tell my kids.
Well, I don't understand you.
In what? With whom?
Those beatnik friends of yours.
They sabotaged my boat.
Beatnik friends? You mean
Jo Symington, Ted, and Judd?
Yeah.
Look at this.
They cut my battery cables to delay me so they could bring up the treasure first.
I can hardly believe that.
I've known Jo Symington ever since she was a little girl.
She wouldn't do anything like that.
Well... maybe she was fooled by them the same way you were.
Fooled?
Hey.
I thought there was something fishy when they said they were going fishing.
You sure you're not in on it?
Of course not.
Oh, they wanted me to go with them.
They were even gonna cut me in.
They were gonna cut you up is what they're gonna do.
Cut you up and dump you.
Dump me?
In the water?
What do you think?
But they got all my equipment.
They're going out again in the morning.
Aha. That's what they think.
Boy, I'm sure glad
I got here when I did.
I sure wouldn't want my kids to lose their faith in Captain Jack.
Well, neither would I.
Good. Now, here's what we're gonna do.
We'll get the equipment...
How could they know what we were after?
Well, what about that picture Gil took, huh?
Maybe that gave him a clue.
That might be it.
Either that, or they're just guessing.
Well, here's your chance to find out now.
Yeah. I'll do that.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Ted.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Listen, what about Jo?
She's pretty mad.
She hasn't shown up here tonight.
Why don't you go up to her house and see what you can do?
I'll meet you there later.
Ok.
I'm sorry about your having to tow us.
I hope you're not angry.
Courtesy of the sea.
Can I buy you a drink?
Why don't we go someplace where we can be alone?
My place? Your place?
The beach?
Your boat's closer.
Oh, no, not my boat.
Why not your boat?
Well, first of all,
I'm all out of champagne, and Gil might be there.
My car's outside.
Why don't we go for a nice long drive?
Oh, that's my car over there.
You really have it made, don't you?
Fancy car, expensive boat-- the whole works.
Jealous?
Sure. I'd like to have it myself.
Where I come from, we didn't even wear shoes.
That must be why you like girls who go barefooted.
Girls? Barefooted?
Jo. Uh, she's kind of a beatnik, isn't she?
Well, if that means happily broke and full of all kind of crazy principles, that's what she is.
Um, look, you said you were going fishing tomorrow.
How about signing me on as your first mate?
I don't have any principles.
I thought you were on your way south.
Oh, Gil said it would take 3 days to fix the battery cables.
That's funny. I never heard of 2 cables going at once.
Oh, I don't know.
I guess they wear out like anything else.
It's a good thing we were close when it happened.
Gil said we're lucky that we weren't further out to sea.
What's with Gil anyway?
He's just a poor boy who wants to be rich.
You can't hate him for that.
Oh, I don't hate him.
He's very useful to have around, but anyone I take seriously would have to have as much as I do.
Otherwise, I'd never know if he wanted me for me.
So until the right millionaire comes along, it's just fun and games, right?
You can't hate me for that.
Get in.
No, thanks. I'm going down to my boat.
At this time of night?
What's so important down there?
I got Captain Jack's equipment onboard, and nobody's watching it.
So if it's all the same with you,
I'll take a rain check.
I don't give rain checks.
Gil?
Is that you?
It's not Gil.
It's me.
Oh, it's you.
That's what I said.
Don't you hit me.
I'm not gonna hit you.
I just want to know what you're doing with my equipment.
It isn't your equipment.
It's my equipment.
I rented it from you by the hour, remember?
Yeah, and your hour was up 10 hours ago.
I've rented it to someone else.
What are you talking about?
Oh, I should have known you were a crook.
Your face is too honest.
I know all about your little scheme.
Gil told me.
You would've dumped me overboard and disappeared with the treasure and my equipment.
I don't remember inviting you aboard.
What are you trying to pull?
Just looking out for
Captain Jack's interests as well as my own.
I've rented him my equipment.
His face is so crooked, he's got to be honest.
Thanks a lot.
He's been lying to you.
He's just trying to get the equipment away from us.
Don't listen to him, captain.
If I were you, I'd leave before the coast guard picks you up for cutting my battery cables.
He knows we can't get the gear from anybody else by tomorrow morning.
He's trying to delay us so he can get out there first.
That's what he did to me!
Wait a minute!
I'm getting dizzy.
Captain, do you think a Navy man would lie to you?
That's right. You were in the Navy, weren't you?
But his children believe in me.
Children?
He's not even married.
That is a horrible thing to say.
That's right, friend.
That's horrible.
Now let's just get out of here.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hurt each other.
Come on, let's get out of here.
All right, so I played dirty.
The name of the game is finders keepers.
That's right, and I found it.
But you got to bring it up in order to keep it, buddy.
And how you gonna do that by tomorrow morning?
Dina and I have all the equipment.
Dina?
Whose idea do you think this was?
I'll straighten her out.
Gangway!
Captain Jack!
Go away! Go away!
I'm closed!
But I need that equipment.
I'm willing to buy it.
Well, I'm not selling it, and I'm not renting it to either one of you.
You're both a couple of greedy rascals.
If you'll just give me a chance to talk to you.
Now, go away now before
I call the police.
They're paid to protect people like me from people like you.
Captain, listen to me, will you?
Help, police!
Help, police!
Help, police!
What happened?
It's nothing.
It's just a joke.
Close the door, man.
You're creating a vacuum.
I'm sorry.
Pierre!
I'm not Pierre.
Oh, well, you're lucky anyway.
Uh, I belong over in that corner over there.
Oh, but getting there is half the fun.
If you'll excuse me.
What are you protesting?
Well, if you don't know,
I'm certainly not going to tell you.
Hi.
Welcome, partner.
Partner?
Judd convinced me to go along with you.
I'm gonna tell the kids about it now.
Now, wait a minute.
Quiet!
Quiet, everybody!
Cool it!
Listen, everybody!
Listen!
I want to tell you something beautiful.
Cinderella is a junkie!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Better than that!
Cigarettes are good for your lungs!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Better than that.
We're going to have that art center we've wanted.
I can't tell you how just yet.
That's a surprise, but we owe thanks to Ted Jackson and Judd Whitman.
Yay!
Yay!
I wish you hadn't done that.
What I started to tell you is we may not be able to go tomorrow.
What do you mean?
What's happened?
Dina and Gil found out about the treasure.
They conned Captain Jack into thinking we were crooks so he'd rent the equipment to them.
Oh, no.
Oh, they've got our equipment?
No. Captain Jack decided not to rent the equipment to either one of us.
But that's the only stuff available.
What are we gonna do?
He's an old friend of yours.
Maybe you can get it back.
I can try.
If we cut out of here now, we can be on the dock by the time he opens up.
Let's go.
Excuse us, folks.
Excuse me.
Excuse us.
You don't understand.
We want to cross.
Hey, Judd, Judd.
This is no good.
I got a better idea.
Lend me your trumpet, will you, pal?
Give me a blast on the horn.
Everybody! Everybody!
Just a minute!
Listen to me just a second!
I've got a story to tell you.
* Ol' Jonah,
He was desperate *
* In the belly
Of the whale *
* But Jonah had a plan
* He knew he couldn't fail
* He raised his head
On high *
* A-lookin'
For the sky *
* And sang a song
So pretty *
* The whale told him
Good-bye *
* You've got to sing,
You children, sing *
* Sing, you children, sing
* I only know one thing
* Hey, hey, hey
* Sing, you children, sing,
Everybody! *
* Sing, you children, sing
* Sing your troubles away

Hey, the car!
It's gone!
Are you sure you parked it here?
Positive. Hey, how'd you get here?
Like everybody else.
In Jo's shuttle bus.
Well, let's take the shuttle bus.
It's on a trip. It won't be back for 2 hours.
Maybe somebody moved it.
A 2-hour trip.
What'd you use, 1 or 2 lumps?
Hey! You looking for something?
Yeah. My car.
Was it a convertible?
Yup.
Was it red?
Yeah, that's it.
Was the license number
SIB9--
Right.
Have you seen it?
Well, here it is.
Oh, no!
I don't believe it.
Isn't it the living end?
It's the first automobile mobile
I've ever done.
But, Zoltan, I've told you, you've got to ask permission.
I'm sorry, but I just couldn't help myself.
I call it Over the Underpass.
Look, buddy, we need this car now!
Put it in a bag.
We're in a hurry.
I'll put it back together again by noon tomorrow.
We got to get to the harbor tonight.
Hey, why don't you take my car?
Where is it hanging?
No. It's outside.
Come on.
It runs even better than it looks.
I hope so.
We cannot be seen on the streets in that.
We can't help but be seen on the streets in that.
I do not have to take your insults, you know.
Zoltan, wait a minute!
Hold it, Zoltan! It's better than nothing!
It's lovely, Zoltan.
Yeah, it's lovely.
Come on, let's go.
Come on. Here.
Get in.
Hey, how do you start this thing?
Push the button marked "go-go."
Go-go. hey, what's the matter with this thing?
It's probably out of gas!
Why didn't you tell us that to begin with?
You never asked.
Where's the nearest service station?
About a half a mile down the road.
Jo, take the wheel.
Judd, let's push.
Put it in neutral.
Take the brake off.
Right.
Hey, wait, wait, wait a minute.
Let's take 5, huh?
We can't stop now.
I didn't do it.
I'll change the tire.
You go to the station and bring back a 5-gallon can.
Of gas?
Yeah, gas.
And run.
All right, I'm running.
Captain!
Aah!
Captain!
Captain Jack!
Captain Jack!
Yes, I'm Captain Jack.
Is anyone there?
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Please help me.
All right, all right.
I'm coming.
Please let me in.
I don't sleep in my clothes, you know.
I need your help.
Take it easy. Don't break the door down.
Hurry! Hurry! Please!
Who is it?
Who's there?
Captain, I need your help.
Please open up.
Why, it's 4:00 in the morning.
It's a matter of life and death.
You've just got to help me.
Oh, well, just a minute.
What is it?
What's the matter?
I'm in trouble.
I'm in terrible trouble.
Well, what can I do?
I need your help desperately.
Please come with me.
Well, couldn't we do this some other time?
Shh. Don't talk.
We may be overheard.
Please come with me.
Wait till I get my shirt.
Young lady, if you're in some kind of trouble, you should call the police.
No, I can't.
I don't think
I'd better get involved.
Listen, does your country mean anything to you,
I mean, anything at all?
My country, of course it does.
Well, then come on.
Don't ask questions.
Well, let me put my shirt on.
I catch cold very easily.
Shh.
Where are we going?
Shh! We have to hurry.
He's coming.
Who's coming?
What is it?
What's going on?
Quick.
Hop on the boat.
Oh, I don't like boats.
I don't like--
Hurry.
Why do we have to hurry?
Come on, over here.
We have to hide.
Hurry. Stay down.
Stay down.
How long have we got to stay here?
Not long. Shh.
What was that?
Nothing. Relax.
Yeah. Relax.
Dina!
Who's that?
It's him.
Him? Who him?
Well, come and meet him.
You!
Glad to have you aboard, captain.
You and your equipment.
I hope you'll forgive us for being so devious, but we were pressed for time.
I'll have you both arrested for this.
Keep him down here.
I'll go cast off.
Cast off? You mean you're going to sea?
Sure, we are.
Get me out!
Get me out!
Captain, just relax.
You make a fuss,
I'll have to clap you in irons.
I'm going to sea.
Aah.
Oh, captain. Captain.
Captain Jack?
Captain Jack? Are you all right, captain?
Well, we blew the whole night doing it, but at least we got enough gas to get there.
Yeah, if that spare tire holds out.
I sure hope Captain Jack sleeps late today.
Can't you go any faster?
That's all she's got.
Hey, look at the speedometer.
It says rare, medium, and well-done.
Yeah, my stove cooks goulash at 50 miles an hour.
Zoltan doesn't care where he gets his parts.
Wake me if we get there.
Hey, look!
It's open!
Captain Jack?
Looks like he's gone.
So is the equipment.
I'll bet Gil and Dina are gone too.
Come on.
Hey, look.
Dina's boat's gone too.
What did I tell you?
Cast off.
Hey, look at this.
"Finders keepers, lover."
Oh, boy.
I think we're wasting time...lover.
We're in the homestretch, captain.
The chest is practically out in the clear.
With a little luck, it should come up like a cork, solid sterling and tax-free.
Oh, you'll have to pay taxes.
It's a privilege.
Not in Istanbul.
Istanbul?
Oh, you didn't think we were going back to Fisherman's Wharf, did you?
Can't we go to someplace a little closer?
Like, uh, Fresno or Bakersfield?
Just remember what I told you.
Santa Monica.
3 yanks, and you start the compressor.
2 after that, and you stop it.
Would you mind going over that again?
Would you mind concentrating?
Oh, I should have never believed you two.
Those other fellas are the ones who found the treasure.
I'm doing them a terrible injustice.
That's right, captain.
You send them a letter of apology from Turkey.
Turkey?
I get seasick even in a Turkish bath.
3 to start, 2 to stop.
Now, you'll have to do it several times, so keep your eye on that float and your mind on your work.
Remember, smile a lot.
You may be on Candid Camera.
This is just another game to you, isn't it?
But of course.
I told you that.
But this one's gonna change things between us.
Not necessarily.
You mean you don't want it to?
I didn't say that.
Get it first, then we'll talk.
There they are, all right.
I wonder if they've got it yet.
We'll soon find out.
What do you plan to do?
Depends on what they're doing.
Help!
I've been Shanghaied!
Hey, there's Captain Jack.
Yeah. Looks like he found out he's swinging with the wrong crowd.
Ship, ahoy!
Thank heaven you're here.
I'm saved!
We didn't come here to rescue you.
Oh, I know what you think of me, and you're right.
I'm a humbug, a double-dealer, a regular Benedict Arnold.
You left out fink.
Where are they?
Oh, they're down there.
They're in the water.
I'm supposed to start the compressor when Gil yanks on that line.
2 yanks to start-- or was it 3?
Anyway, the air will fill the float bags when he's got them attached to the chest.
That'll float it up.
Yeah, I know. How long have they been down?
Oh, only a few minutes this time.
Do exactly as he told you, if you can remember.
And one other thing.
What's that?
Who's renting that equipment?
You are, sir.
That's all I wanted to know.
Move the compressor onto my boat.
We'll continue the operation from there.
Judd will help you.
Hey, what are you gonna do, pally?
You heard the man.
Those float bags down there are ours.
I'm going down to get them... and the treasure.
How much longer can they stay down there?
I don't know.
Another 10 minutes, I guess.
It hasn't moved.
I've kept my eye on it all the time.
There it is!
That's the signal.
3 yanks.
That means turn the air on.
Hey, look there!
That's Gil!
Didn't I see you in a monster movie, baby?
I wonder what's happened to him.
I guess he's put on some weight.
Jack: bring it up.
I got it, I got it.
Don't worry, I got it.
Out of the way.
Watch it now, watch it.
Wow.
Hold it now.
Wait a second.
Down with it a little bit.
Down a little bit.
Take it easy, boys, take it easy.
Don't get excited at this stage of the game.
All right, stand aside.
Look out, look out.
Good, good, good.
You got it!
It's open!
Yay!
There's another lock there.
Give it a whack there.
Oh, got it?
Wait a minute.
Can I help?
Wait a minute.
All right, here we go.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah, we got it!
We got it!
Aah!
Oh, look at it!
Let's go back and find out how much it's worth, how much we're worth.
Congratulations.
Like I said, finders keepers.
Thanks.
There are no hard feelings, I hope.
Not as far as I'm concerned, but if the captain wants to press charges, that's his business.
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm very grateful to these people.
Grateful?
For what?
They're responsible for me being out here.
I finally made it past the breakwater.
Now that you're rich, maybe you'd like to buy a cabin cruiser.
I'm thinking of selling mine.
I'll keep that in mind when I cash this in.
Let's go.
It's been fun.
Let's go, sourpuss.
If there's anything I hate, it's a good sport.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh, yes!
Well, what are they worth, huh?
I think my top price would be 30.
$30 apiece!
Wait a minute, Wait a minute.
I don't think you understood.
I meant 30 cents apiece.
You can't be serious.
Hold it, everybody.
Look, I looked it up.
Pieces of eight are worth at least $20 each.
Yes, if they're silver, more if they're gold.
But unfortunately these are copper.
Copper?
But they look like--
I'm afraid that the slime has given them a patina.
No, these coins are quite common, and of very little interest to numismatists.
Numisma-whats?
That's Armenian for coin collector.
Let's see. You say you have approximately 13,000 coins.
At 30 cents apiece, that's, uh...
I can offer you $3,900.
For all the time and the money we spent.
My equipment is worth more than that.
I'm terribly sorry.
I can understand your disappointment, but that's really the best that I can do.
A moment, my friends.
Just remember, it isn't whether you win or lose, but how you play the game.
Will you please stop it?
We'll take it.
Well, there we go.
$975 each.
No, no, no.
It just isn't right.
I cannot accept a full share.
But it was your equipment, captain.
You talked me into it.
I was only fooling, you know.
Well, it's been a lot of fun.
Yeah, but with $1,000 invested,
I'm right back where I started.
And this isn't even close to a down payment on the art center.
Yeah. I make more than that on a Saturday night selling leftover pizzas.
Leftover pizzas?
How much would it take for a down payment on the art center?
At least 4,000 or 5,000.
Here's my share, Jo.
What?
We might as well put it all where it'll do the most good.
What do you think, Judd?
I think I just made a contribution.
Oh, thank you.
This is wonderful.
Ahem.
Oh, take it.
It would only put me in a higher tax bracket.
You are a dear.
I'm a dear.
She kissed me.
That's just the down payment.
For the rest, we'll throw a big bash, collect donations, and Jo will have all the money in one evening.
Oh, you're marvelous.
Ok, and I will spring for the beer and the pizzas if you'll come back to work here like you promised.
You have got a deal, partner.

Captain! Captain!
Ross! Strike!
Hold her down, Chen! l got a strike!
- What you got?
- lts putting up a fight!
Dont let it get away.
- Maybe youd better give me a hand.
- Right.
Watch it!
OK, Mr Morgan, shes all yours.
Watch yourself!
Thanks. Heart attacks are so common. ld hate to bury him at sea.
- Arthur! You reel him in.
- Shut up and give me another pill.
Open your mouth... There you go, sport.
OK, Chen. Lets haul it in.
OK, Chen. Now.
Put a canvas over it, Chen.
- Where is it?
- lts in the bow, Mr Morgan.
- l like the way you did that.
- Thanks.
Ahoy, Kingfisher!
Ahoy, West Wind!
- Well race you!
- Why? You know l cant beat you.
- A sailboat take a fisher?
- l let them win.
- l can see why.
- Theyre girls!
See you at the dock, Ross!
- Sure is a beauty.
- Which one?
The boat! Sharp, aint she?
- Real yare, Jack.
- Ross.
Why dont you relax and come get some sun with me?
- Why not check on your husband?
- No!
Take a look, Chen.
- Mr Morgan, hes sleeping.
- Thats him!
- Dont you feel sorry for me?
- ln a way, yeah.
-You must get a lot of this.
- Quite a bit.
Youd think the fish smell would keep them away.
- You wanna keep them away?
- No! l like girls.
- Not as much as the boat.
- l live on her. ld like to own her.
- Whats stopping you?
- Money.
That shouldnt be a problem.
- You must be kidding.
- No, l wouldnt do that. l dont give to organised charity.
But theres a big charge in doing it this way.
- lndividual cases.
- Mrs Morgan... l dont accept charity. l have to earn what l get.
You would, honey. You would.
- Ross.
- Hi.
When will you teach your daughters to stow a sail?
Mr Morgan liked the boat.
Hell charter again.
Can l talk to you, please?
Whats the matter, Papa Stavros?
- Nothing.
- Somethings bugging you.
- The doctor says a bug is bugging me.
- lm sorry...
Today, he tells us we must move to a dry climate, like Arizona.
- Arizona?
- Arizona.
Papa learn English so they want him to move.
- What they speak there?
- Mama, this is not a joke.
- Dont worry, Ross. We wont move.
- But if youre sick...
Sick? A woman isnt as young as she was, so they look for a reason.
- Then its not serious?
- Of course it is.
Dont listen. lf he says he must sell the boats, also dont listen.
Come to our wedding anniversary on Wednesday night and forget about all this.
- All right, Mama, thank you.
- Chen. You come, too.
Thank you, Mama.
Come on, Papa. You have made enough trouble already.
Papa...
The West Wind, too?
Yes.
Hey, Sam.
- Hi, Ross.
- How are you?
Shell be off soon. Wait at the bar.
- Long time no see.
- Not so long.
To what disaster do l owe this visit?
- You know?
- No.
Only, l know when old head on the shoulder Robin comes on. l come when theres nothing wrong.
You come when you want to sing a little or cry on my shoulder.
- Which is it tonight?
- l dont feel much like singing.
Stavros is moving to Arizona, selling the fishing boats and the West Wind.
Good. lts the only way to get it out of your system. lts not that easy. Losing a home and a job all in one day. lt might be worth it... if you lose the dream, too.
Look, my father and l built the boat together. l wanted to own it.
Thats not a dream.
Your father is gone and so is that part of your life.
The worst thing for you was
Papa letting you live on that boat.
- l can count on that speech.
- Count on me.
- Here we go again!
- Should l pretend l dont care?
Dont make things tougher than they are!
Ready for your number, Robin?
Let Sir Galahad do it, OK?
- What are you doing to her, Ross?
- Nothing.
He just came in to tell me his troubles and l told him mine.
- lts my fault.
- lts nobodys fault...
Jeez! Would somebody sing?
- Sure, Mac, sure.
- Thanks, pal.
Hey, you sing, Ross.
Come on, favour to me.
Great! Any time you wanna make it permanent, let me know.
Thanks, Sam. lm still a fisherman.
- Whats this?
- The swinger with the mink look sent it.
- You must smell of musk or something.
- Excuse me. l dont work here, but thanks anyway.
- Whats the matter? Not enough?
- Want me to...?
- You sing lousy anyway.
- Thank you.
- l thought you sang very well...
- He stinks! The old stinkeroo.
- Ross Carpenter.
- Laurel Dodge.
Yes, sir.
The real old-fashioned stinkeroony.
- Whos the intellectual?
- A bad idea l had. Blind date.
- Hes blind, all right.
- Wait, pal, get your own date.
Had to call the cops, didnt you?
Thank you.
- Go cry on her shoulder.
- Wait a minute.
Youre Sir Galahad, all right, to strangers.
- lm sorry l caused trouble for you.
- Dont give it a second thought.
Girls!
- What?
- You dropped a handkerchief.
- Come on!
- Got a match?
- Cut it out.
- l thought you needed help.
- l can get this from my enemies.
- l never saw him before.
- Honey, l gathered that.
- Now, you come on!
He said he was a friend of my fathers and he wasnt.
OK, l believe you.
OK. Whos the girl?
She said she was an old football buddy of my mothers, but she wasnt.
- Where do you live?
- Down the road.
- Very far?
- Not too far.
Lets go. lf youre trying to tire me, its working.
Whats the name of that church?
- The Old Church, everybody knows that.
- lve never been here before.
Where do you come from?
Grand Rapids?
No. Cant we go back and go inside?
- Corpus Christi?
- No.
You could rest.
Maybe sing with the choir.
- Prattville, Oklahoma?
- No! lts such a nice night. Wouldnt you like to go to another local landmark?
Only the one youre staying at.
- lll show you where lm staying.
- Good. Shall l call a cab?
- l dont think thats necessary.
- lf you think lm gonna walk...
Well, here we are.
- Here?
- lts simple and it reeks of history.
- Reeks of something.
- Goodnight.
- Arent you asking me in?
- They double the rent for that.
- What do you think this place is?
- l want to find out.
Tomorrow.
- What time?
- Lunch?
- lll pick you up.
- Where are we eating?
The Mariners. Menu?
- Well meet there.
- You dont know it. lll find it.
Youre sweet, Ross.
Then, why am l leaving?
Would you like a room or anything? lf you dont mind parrots.
- Parrots?
- Yes.
You see, l have 23 darling creatures who travel with me everywhere.
Of course, l always make arrangements far ahead.
The Hilton people werent at all understanding this time.
As a result, l find myself and these poor creatures left...
You have to excuse me now. lts their dinner time. Bye-bye, yall.
Bye-bye, now.
Bye-bye, now... Parrots?
Ross!
- Ross!
- Yes, sir.
You know Mr Johnson?
By reputation.
Mr Johnson is interested in the boats.
- These the other boats?
- Yes.
Theyre in first-class shape,
Ross sees to that.
How would l know? Lets shake down the Kingfisher and lll tell you.
Ross, he wants to take a ride.
Youre on, Skipper.
Hey, dont rev it up so much. l dont want burnt valves.
- lf l want.
- Cast off, Papa.
- Comin aboard, Papa?
- No, l gotta stay with Mama.
He doesnt wanna get hot-rodded around by you.
Know something, Mr Johnson?
You may be right.
OK, Captain Blood.
Can we go home now?
- Why not?
- Can you handle a following sea?
- Like to try?
- No!
- Unless you can get some speed up.
- Speed, huh?
OK.
- Are you gonna buy the boats?
- At a price.
- l bet. Three top boats.
- Whats wrong with the fourth?
- Whatd you do with the sailboat?
- Make like a gentleman of the sea. lf the old manll throw it in.
- lt wouldnt suit you.
- l have a girl it would.
- Wholl teach you to sail?
- She will. lts her second-favourite sport.
Your butterflies opened. Two of em.
Thats the sea, unpredictable.
Have to clean the carburettor.
Shouldnt take a good mechanic over five minutes.
Can you hold that for me?
Keep it turned away from you. lts a little messy, you know.
Ross!
Ross!
Hello, Suzie Wong!
- Arent we getting repetitious?
- l came, l saw, l left. l leave now.
You were very late. l waited.
- You picked up an ageing gentleman.
- My father.
Thats no gentleman, thats my father.
- lll make my own jokes, thanks.
- lts not funny. lts sad.
You didnt show.
Hes in town so l called him.
Why am l always explaining?
Maybe its something you do.
The hotel never heard of you.
- Trust me on that one.
- Why?
Because l went to the trouble of asking where l could find you, and you like games as well as l do.
Come aboard and play.
- Tell me the rules.
- l got a feeling youd cheat.
Thats usually what ladies say to gentlemen.
- l just came to mend fences.
- Ever tried canvas?
- Can you stitch?
- l kicked the habit.
- Sit down. Coffee?
- Save it for tonight.
- What happens tonight?
- Dinner. lm taking you to dinner!
Well eat at my bosss house.
- lf youre broke...
- lm not. l hope youre not dreary about money.
We go where l can afford or not at all. lts Papa and Mama Stavros anniversary. lll meet you at 7.30 sharp.
No wandering around hotel lobbies.
7.30 sharp.
Whats she doing here? ls the fleet in?
- Lay off, Robin.
- Ditto.
Wanna come aboard? l wouldnt get aboard
Cleopatras barge with you.
- Why did you come?
- To apologise for the other night.
- l accept.
- l withdraw.
- l didnt know you had company.
- Robin.
- Youre a fast worker.
- l know youre upset. lm not upset. lm hurt. H-U-R-T.
You know how it is between you and l. l dont want to hear that. l know how it is between us. l also know how it could be, OK?
OK.
Youll come back this time, like you always do.
All right, Robin, all right.
Are you? Tell me. l dont know.
Sir Galahad.
Youre Sir Galahad,
Don Juan and Casanova rolled into one. lf it isnt this boat, its girls.
Girls, girls, girls!
And dont you follow me!
Sir? Could you tell me...?
Scat! Get outta here! Scat!
- This is really your family, isnt it?
- Well, sort of. l never knew my mother.
We lost her when l was born.
When my dad died, l had to sell the boat to pay for everything, so...
You dont have to explain to me. lm sorry theyre leaving.
Quiet, please! Quiet!
A toast from Linda and me to Mama and Papa, for taking the trouble to meet, marry and get us born. lt was no trouble at all!
Excuse me.
Many happy years to you, Mama and Papa Stavros. Best of health.
- This is for you.
- Thank you, Ross!
- Ross, what do l get?
- You got Mama!
Please, dont cry, Mama.
Thats not good for you.
Mama!
- lts so pretty!
- l know, but dont cry.
Shes running just fine. Just fine.
You love this boat.
Oh, yeah. My father and l spent every spare minute working on it.
We measured, sanded and polished every board.
My dad was a great guy.
Youd have liked him.
And then, the day it was finished was the day he died.
Somehow the boat meant... lm sorry. Were getting too serious.
Were supposed to be relaxing!
Nice day, nice breeze...
- Nice boy.
- Nice girl.
- l like you!
- l dont know why!
Lets live to find out!
KO V Marine Channel repeating emergenct weather report.
Hold the tiller, Laurel.
Small craft warnings have been hoisted.
Vessels are advised to seek shelter.
This is KO V Marine repeating coastguard weather.
- Shall we start back?
- No, well go to Paradise Cove.
Chen Yungs folks live there. ld like you to meet em.
Pretty good catch, huh, boys?
All right. Lets...
Ahoy, Kin!

One hour later, you want second date.
Old men remember small things very big. Old Chinese proverb.
Dinner finished.

Young couple look at own calm before storm. You help wash dishes.
Honourable ancestors do not approve of men in kitchen!
Use honourable detergent!

Looks like rain to me.
Help!

Everybody wants to be a critic.

That means...
Earth boy dream of angel
Make him have happy heart ln land of love
Angel dream of earth boy ln land of love
Youd better run! lll get you!
Run home to your mama.
Too late for children to be up.
Too late for anybody to be up.
- ls she trying to tell us something?
- Something. l wonder what it could be.
- You go to bed now.
- A mans home is his castle.
Kin, you sleep with brother-in-law next door.
Kin doesnt like to sleep with brother-in-law. He snores.
You sleep with brother-in-law!
- Sleep well.
- Goodnight.
Ross, Laurel, you come with me.
Laurel, you sleep with me.
Ross, you on couch.
- Goodnight.
- Night.
Night. l must have gotten the wrong fortune cookie.
Laurel...? Laurel!
Laurel!
Ahoy, West Wind!
One if by land...
...and two if by sea.
We can weigh anchor, Admiral. lm ready. lts no fit night for man nor beast. lts not sensational here, either.
- Frightened?
- Terrified! Lets watch.
Good idea.
Why do you feel so much more alive in a storm? l dont know.
Maybe its because everything seems more intense, more real.
This is real.
Yes.
You sound doubtful.
- Youre not too real yourself.
- Not yet.
- Youre not married, are you?
- Almost. ls that what youre running away from?
Yes. Lets not talk any more.
You still love him?
He didnt love me.
- l didnt ask you that.
- l was hurt.
- The whole thing was such a lie.
- What about him?
Thats why my father brought me here from Chicago. lts over with, but lm just not all together yet.
Youre together enough for me. l couldnt stand being fooled again. lts me. And it is real. lsnt it?
- Were getting wet.
- Do you care? l dont want to care about anything!
- Goodbye, Ross!
- Bye, Miss Laurel!
Come back soon!
- Bye, kids!
- Goodbye, everybody!
Bye!
Papa Stavros! What are you doing? l didnt expect you.
Hello, Miss Dodge.
- Whats the ledger for?
- Marine insurance.
- They want the gear itemised.
- l itemised it last month.
Well, this is sort of an inventory.
Ross. l sold the boats.
You sold em? All?
Johnson said, Take it or leave it. l need the money for the house...
- You dont have to explain.
- Well, l just...
How soon does he take over?
- Ross. The trouble is...
- lll get my gear packed.
No, no! Tonight, tomorrow...
Goodbye, now.
- Where will you live?
- Chen can take me in for a while.
What are you gonna do?
Yep. lm gonna see him now.
Right now.
- Chen?
- Nope, Johnson.
- lll take you home.
- lll get a cab. Go see him.
Wait. You were going to let me take you home, werent you? l live at 1 36 Bay Street. lll be waiting.
- l dont know how long...
- lll be waiting!
- We knock, Skipper.
- And we take advantage of old men.
This was no Greek bearing gifts. l paid.
Will you sell the West Wind?
Depends. l dont own anything without a price.
- How much?
- Ten thousand.
- What dyou pay Stavros?
- Six.
- Youre a thief!
- A businessman. Got the money?
- You know l havent got any.
- Why are you wasting my time?
Johnson... Whatll you do with the fishing boats?
Dry dock. Painting and refitting.
Theyll be out of circulation for a while. And so will you.
- Want to work for me?
- Doing what?
- Fishing for tuna.
- No dice.
- lll tell you...
- lll tell you what youre gonna do.
Get your junk off my sailboat. Now.
Hold on, Skipper!
Youll get nowhere with games like choking the Kingfisher´s engine.
All that did was let me knock the sale price down.
All right, you want a job?
Then will you sell me the boat for so much a week?
Everythings for sale.
But l wont promise not to sell her.
- What do you pay a captain?
- Captain?
Shouldnt you be a deck-hand first?
Sixty bucks a trip. lf you really want the boat, make two trips a week.
- Commercial captains get a percentage.
- Not if theyre inexperienced.
Why pay me a salary?
This way, the more l haul, the more we both make.
- What percentage?
- Ten percent.
- Two.
- Seven.
- Five and l see the books.
- OK. Deal.
- Chen Yung goes with it.
- Sure.
- Thats how generous l am.
- Real generous.
- Drink?
- lf yours is a Mickey.
You know, l like you.
You remind me of me.
- Trying to get me to blow the deal?
- Be here tomorrow. 3 a.m.
- And you can stay on the sailboat.
- Want me to maintain it, too?
You will, Skipper. You will.
- l came to talk to you, Sam.
- Good.
- Well?
- Got room for another singer?
The other dame sings, too?
Youre becoming a specialist.
- l sing.
- lve been telling you that.
- lm available.
- What made you decide, now?
- Money.
- lve offered you money before. l didnt need it before.
How much can l make?
Scale to begin with.
More if youre a big draw.
This wont affect Robin. She stays.
Of course. She stays.
Sam, dont say anything about it. lll tell her tomorrow, OK?
- Where are you going?
- l got a date.
- Theres a nice crowd. Go on now.
- l cant tonight.
Fishing, singing and hunting?
That makes for a full day.
Youre gonna have to give up something.
Come on, Ross. l want to see if l made a good deal.
All right, Sam.
- Doctor Livingstone!
- Hi!
Somehow this isnt how l imagined the big reconciliation.
Good evening.
Regular patrons know Ross Carpenter, whos sung here many times.
Tonight, Ross sings for the first time as a professional.
Hell be here regularly from now on.
Lets all wish him a lot of luck.
Thats what l was trying to tell you.
Thought you were letting me tell her.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Play it again! More!
- More!
- Come on! More!
Ross?
Ross?
- More!
- Sing it again!
- Robin, l was going to...
- You go the whole route, dont you?
Pull the rug from under me, take the bread out of my mouth. lt sounds complicated. lm keeping the wolf from the door.
- From the boat!
- lm singing for the money to buy it. lm doing two jobs at once. lt doesnt affect you.
You bet it doesnt.
- Can l go now?
- Anchors away!
- Youre a busy boy!
- Youre not on my back, too!
The other one was just here.
She went that-a-way.
Laurel!
Laurel!
- People dont stand me up.
- lm not people.
And this is your second try.
- What were you doing with Robin?
- Sam gave me a job.
- Fishing?
- Yeah, the place is full of tuna!
Very funny!
When lm not working for Johnson, lm here.
When do you work at us? Split shift?
- l need the money.
- Money isnt that important.
Not when youve got it. lts important to me.
How come it isnt to you?
- lts what you buy that matters.
- Hes not going to give me the boat.
- And not much else means anything.
- Thats right. Until l do buy it. l thought it was Robin. l wish it was, l could fight that.
- You dont understand.
- lve never wanted anything that badly.
Who and what are you that lets you play it this cool?
Did you forget something? lm sure she isnt cool and she really understands.
Why dont you go back to her?
- No comment?
- lm thinking of the answer.
- Have you found it?
- Yeah, lve found it.
Lets see if we catch more bait than tuna.
Havent had much luck catching anything yet.
Wheres the bait?
We got a net full of water!
We havent got enough bait for a sardine, much less a tuna!
Start the engines.
Lets make another haul.
Head out to sea, Chen.
Hey! Kill the engine!
Take it out of reverse!
Kill it! Kill it!
Kill it!
Gee, Ross. lm sorry.
Oh, well. Save the pieces.
Johnsonll want to count em.
We go home now?
Unless you want to catch a tuna by hand!
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!
- Lot different than game fishing.
- Or shrimping. l used to do that off New Orleans.
New Orleans. l wish l was there right now.
- Well, lll be...
- How long to fix it?
- Too long.
- How soon for a new section?
No wonder youre in a hurry. lf that trips a sample, youll have to live out there.
Mr Johnson! Thats it.
- One ton!
- l read more.
- Maybe 20 pounds more.
- 1 ton, 20 pounds. How much? lll have to check todays prices.
Lets go to the office.
Where you got that trick adding machine!
Why the For Sale sign?
How do you sell a boat if you dont let people know its for sale?
Thought you had a girl that just loved sailing?
That was last week.
This week, she likes staying home.
- Knitting.
- Youre funny.
Honey, whats todays price?
Now give me the one on tuna.
Thank you, honey.
Your cuts $23. So, figuring $1 1 0 for a new section, you owe me $87.
Mr Johnson, dont go without food and water until you get it.
- You wanted a percentage.
- On profit!
- Wheres the profit?
- Next trip. lf l make a next trip.
- l got 20 bucks says you will.
- lts a bet. lll show you what kind of guy l am.
Call it square.
- lll pay for the net.
- No.
- $23 and you pay for the net.
- No.
All right. You owe me $20 on your bet, because lm through.
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty.
Skipper!
Youre a rough beginner! lm learning from you, Pops, lm learning from you!
- Hi!
- Hi!
Dont be nervous. l come as a friend.
- Why are you all made up?
- This is what ladies wear to work.
- This is called a hat.
- Oh, a hat.
- l got a job.
- As what? Mata Hari?
No, selling ladies hats.
Nothing mysterious about that.
- Are you still mad at me?
- No.
- How are things?
- Not too good.
- Hes selling the boat.
- l know.
- What about that lunch?
- l cant. lm due at the shop.
- Arent you carrying this too far?
- Theres dinner.
- ld like to cook for you.
- You know what youre doing?
Youll find out when you taste the cooking. Remember the address?
- 1 36 Bay Street.
- And lll be waiting.
- Try not to detour this time.
- Try not to detour this time!
- Hello!
- Do something!
- What?
- The ovens on fire!
Dont get excited.
- Got any salt?
- Just ground pepper or oregano.
- Looking for salt?
- No, a place to hide.
- lf l have any, it will be up there.
- Thanks.
This is salt. lm gonna show you something. lts an old wives trick.
Maybe its a little too well done.
How can you say that?
You dont have an old wife?
- lts kind of late...
- You never said!
You never asked! No!
This is white wine.
Got any canned shrimp or crab?
Yes, but the dressing l bought goes with cheese.
- Got any oil?
- l dont mind the squeak.
- Salad oil!
- l have some from the drugstore.
Never mind! Forget it.
See the little box? Pick it up.
Attagirl! Put it in your little hand.
Come in here.
Light the candles.
Take off your shoes.
Smoke your corn-cob pipe and dinnerll be ready in a jiffy.
Papas gonna cook the dinner.
Mustnt play with matches!
- Coffee in the living room, Madam?
- Please.
- Cream and sugar?
- Black, thank you.
Shall l drown that out? Next door have very far-out tastes in music. l kind of like it.
Maybe its the way l feel.
- Dinner wasnt that bad?
- Best meal l ever cooked!
Ross, its still the boat, isnt it?
You think lm dingy, dont you?
You can want a thing for the right reason. But prepare yourself.
- lf shes sold?
- Yes.
Well, the good thing is l wont have to work for Johnson any more.
Shh... ! lts a fight!
- Theyre arguing about bracelets.
- What did she say?
She says if he feels that way, he can have them back.
He got em back!
Shes working up to bigger things.
Theyre not fighting. l hope theyre married!
Yeah, me, too.
Just trying to make em feel at home.
These walls not only have ears, they got hands, feet, broomsticks...
My turn!
Well, hello!
Youre Mr Johnson?
Or lm stealing his liquor.
- Bloody Mary?
- Laurel Dodge.
Come in and close the door!
- Wont you join me in my vice?
- lm touched. But lm on business. ln that case, lll have this later.
Sit down. lm better on my feet. lm told its a must with you.
- Flattery will get you everywhere.
- l doubt it.
- ld like to buy the sailboat.
- A lot of people would.
- They come every morning.
- lm here this morning.
- lts $1 0,000, Miss...
- Dodge. Like in Detroit?
You dont have to club me!
- 1 0,000 is too much.
- But thats the price.
- l know what you paid.
- Everybody knows what l paid.
You have to want to buy more than l want to sell. And l bet you do.
- Not that much.
- Good. We can forget the boat.
- Lunch? A drive?
- Seven?
- Oclock? Dinner? Even better!
- 8,000, thats all lve got.
Would you like a loan till next week?
The interest would be too high.
Stay a while! lm not as tough as l seem.
- lm sure. But youre as greedy.
- lm just trying to be nice. lf you want to sweet-talk me, do it in numbers!
Temper, Miss Dodge! Temper!
$ 1 0,000!
And tou´re calling me collect!
No, Daddy, $2,000. lve got eight in my account.
l know, l just gave it to tou.
Are tou in trouble?
- Of course not!
- Wht that much monet?
- lll tell you when l see you.
- Now!
Youll only make a big thing of it.
Please, deposit the $2,000 in my account and trust me.
Are tou sure it´s nothing medical?
Thats my pop!
- ls that you breathing?
- Who is he?
- A fisherman.
- A marlin fisherman?
No, Daddy. Not marlin. Tuna.
- Tuna!
- People have to eat! lm gonna write that cheque now,
Daddy. Bye!
OK. Thanks.
Mr Johnson.
That must be it.
Youre from Alcoholics Anonymous!
Youre gaping, Mr Johnson! lts a Chicago bank. ltll take a few days to clear.
The boat can stay here. lm not asking you to wrap it up!
Youre in the big time now.
Lets not be so shook up.
- That lm saving for someone else.
- Just one condition.
- What?
- Dont tell anyone l bought it.
- l promise. Let me show you...
- Thats not necessary. l have to! Dont want your diamonds caught in the rigging!
- Thank you. lll manage.
- A toast to the new owner.
- lts a custom of the sea.
- l look forward to it.
Remember, lm serious about keeping this secret.
- Want me to sign in blood?
- Would you?
Bring in another one!
Attaboy! Bring in another one!
Hey, Chen!
Attaboy! Bring in another one!
Beautiful!
What did you do?
Hijack another boat?
- Get em unloaded. Fast!
- You heard! Get em unloaded.
Sure is a happy one!
You gotta say one thing for him.
He sure...
He sure is! Weigh em and load em.
Thats the last truck-load.
Take it away!
- Whats the figure?
- Gross weight.
- And that?
- The days price per ton!
- Whats that sneaky little figure?
- Sliding scale differential.
- What does that mean?
- lt means your share is $7 1 .59.
Your differential friend has thrown you a curve. l make it $1 03.
- Thats without the sliding scale.
- Sos our deal.
Bigger load, smaller percentage. lts standard.
- ln the numbers racket?
- Everyone accepts it.
Mr Johnson!
The more l haul, the bigger your cut. l was nice when you blew your first run. Dont push me!
Johnson! ld rather you be honest than nice.
- $7 1 is good for a days work.
- $1 03 is better. lts what we agreed.
$7 1 and 59 cents.
Count out the rest, Mr Johnson.
You just dont understand business.
Johnson!
The For Sale signs off.
- Usually is when you sell.
- Who bought it?
Thats classified material, Skipper.
Pick up your money.
This just came in. l know its new...
...but is it really me? l think it captures your image extremely well, Mrs Figgot.
Oh! That one over there has a teeny-weensy bit more elan. l dont think so. This is... lve always loved roses...
This one is so beautifully understated, dont you think?
- Absolutely muted.
- lll take it.
- Put it on my account.
- Yes.
Now... ! Lets check...
No!
- lm sorry. We ran out of boxes.
- Thats all right. l just love the hat! Bye!
Laurel...
- Where is it?
- lts been sold.
- lt was mine!
- l know.
Why didnt you do something?
- Are you just going to stand there?
- Can we go?
This is outrageous. l will not stand for it.
- Mr Peabody!
- l heard the sound of conflict.
- You must be the manager.
- Yes, Madam. lm Mrs Figgot.
- Thats a name you dont fool with!
- lm taking my coffee break.
Miss Dodge!
- The penalty for desertion...
- Mr Peabody!
How did you know
Johnson sold the West Wind? l went to the docks to look for you and they were taking the sign off.
- Good afternoon.
- Come with me, please.
- May l take your order?
- Two coffees, two salads. OK?
Bring the coffee now, please.
Theres something l must tell you.
The man l told you about...
That wasnt the first time ld been fooled.
- With you...
- With me, what?
With you it was different. lt wasnt me before, it was my money.
Oh! Thats the mystery. Youre rich.
Yes.
- Try to live with it!
- Dont!
- You dont know what its like.
- No, l dont!
You look at every man suspiciously. l had to find someone whod love me for myself.
- lve been very lucky.
- Weve both been lucky, that way.
- Why are you telling me this now?
- l bought the West Wind, Ross.
- Where are you going?
- l dont know. lm going with you.
- What have l done?
- Look...
When my father died, l lived on what people gave me.
Clothes that didnt fit, toys that had been thrown out. l thought the food l ate was because someone had finished with it.
Youll never understand.
A man must work for what he wants. l have a right to do this for you. l love you! l dont take handouts from anybody. l dont want to be kept.
Arent we working a little early today?
- You sing very well.
- l hear youre talented, too.
- lm sorry how things turned out.
- Boo-hoo.
- We had a fight.
- Tough.
Do you know where he is?
- l ought to have you thrown out.
- l have to find him.
He does this all the time.
Gets in a mood and disappears.
- Where?
- Paradise Cove.
Thatll be home now the Stavroses are gone. lm being much too polite to you. l must be over the guy!
- Ready, Robin?
- Sure.
- Well?
- l would like to thank you.
Youd better not.
- Too late. Got my drink down.
- May l use that man? lll pay.
You want to rent him or buy him?
l want him to sail the West Wind to Paradise Cove. l couldnt possibly spare him.
There must be somebody you can spare.
Theres only one man this business can spare.
- Thats me.
- lm sure of that. lll take you.
- How much?
- lt wont cost you a dime.
- Just what do you expect?
- Dinner, Saturday.
- Thats all?
- l dont have to push. l know lm irresistible.
- When can we start?
- lll get my hat and go with you.
- Ed, stand by to cast off.
- Yes, sir.
Make yourself comfortable. l heard sailboats needed sails to sail.
They do.
- You didnt say it had an auxiliary.
- You didnt ask. l could have done this myself. lve been had.
Not yet.
Your eyes are bigger than your stomach, Mr Johnson.
- Guests dont work, Ross.
- This one does.
Better get it finished. Radio says heavy rains in the next few hours.
They did, huh? We find out.
Kapu! Kapu!
Kapu!
There you are, kitty.
First time l saw that.
He must know hell be fed.
No food. He tells weather. lts gonna rain. l heard it on the radio.
- What they know about weather?
- l suppose Kapu knows!
White spots in eyes, it rain.
No spots, no rain.
No spots, no rain.
Youd better stow this gear if you dont want to get it wet.
Very dangerous animal when contradicted.
- Terribly sorry!
- lll bet.
Chen!
- Chen!
- Yes, sir!
- Do you see anything?
- Yes, sir!
Fish?
No, sir!
Captain! Hey, Captain!
Fish off the starboard bow!
Thank you! Youre very kind.

Kin Yung house. Emergency!
Ross, you stop now.
Save strength for party.
- What party?
- Big catch, big party. l do the work. l dont feel much like a party.

Plenty wine, plenty girls.
Not interested. lts hot!

Never mind. Thanks, Chen.
Thank you, Madam.
Get in the skiff. lll tell you later!

- About half a mile out, straight ahead. l step on it.
- Why dont you let go of me?
- Dont worry, shes on automatic pilot.
Open her up, Kin!
- You wanna fly, Ross?
- lf we can, yeah!
OK, we fly.
Now, were flyin!
Now lll ask you a question.
Whats so special in Paradise Cove?
- Know what l think? Ross Carpenter.
- What about him?
You bought this boat for him.
Or you bought him for this boat.
Now, theres a boy on a mans errand.
Now, take it easy! Relax! l see em!
Ahoy, Skipper!
Just pull up alongside em.
Welcome aboard!
Ross!
Get off the white horse.
You got it all wrong.
Stop it, Ross!
- Stop it!
- Relax and enjoy it. You cant stop him.
- Get up!
- Finished?
- No, lm not finished.
- You are. You havent got the heart.
Youre gonna buy this boat back from her.
- Am l, Miss Dodge?
- lf he says so.
- l say so.
- For you, anything. Like l said...
Kin! Come and get us!
Bring it in closer, Kin.
OK, jump!
He still reminds me of me.
Know something? l should win a medal.
- What for?
- For being the worlds biggest jackass.
- Well, say something.
- OK. Youre the worlds biggest jackass. l thought the only thing that could make me happy was owning the boat.
- But lm over it!
- l love you anyway.
Tell you what.
Well build a new boat, you and l. ls that a proposal or a proposition?
Either you marry me or live with me in sin.
Couldnt l have a little bit of both?
Oh, no... Oh, no!
- Here we go again!
- Here we go again!

Also in this house dwells
Pseudolus, slave to his son.
Pseudolus is my favourite character in the piece... a role of enormous variety and nuance, and played by an actor of such versatility, such magnificent range, such...
Let me put it this way...
I play the part.
Something familiar, something peculiar
Something for everyone: a comedy tonight
Something that's gaudy, something that's bawdy
Something for everybody's taste
Pantaloons and tunics
Courtesans and eunuchs
Funerals and chases
Baritones and basses
- Panderers
- Philanderers
- Cupidity
- Timidity
- Mistakes
- Fakes
- Rhymes
- Mimes
Tumblers, grumblers, fumblers, bumblers
No royal curse, no Trojan Horse
And there's a happy ending of course
Goodness and badness
Man in his madness
This time it all turns out all right
Tragedy tomorrow
Comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy
Comedy tonight
Hup! Hie!
You, boy. Why are we stopping? Hurry up.
My dear and noble neighbours, my apologies.
Since moving in next door I've been remiss in not calling to pay my respects.
However, it is our inaugural week, and you know what that is.
I certainly do not. Move on.
All right, don't stand.
Move. Move! Hup.
A common flesh pedlar in the house next to ours. Disgusting!
Disgraceful. All that revolting flesh, just next door.
- Make way for the house of Senex.
- Senex, wait.
Wait.
Is this not Pseudolus, your slave?
He was parading as a citizen.
Believe me, mistress, I was not parading.
I was walking humbly like a slave.
He invited us to game with him.
He cheated us out of nine minae.
- Nine? I took seven.
- Return nine.
One. Two. Three. Four. I'm being cheated out of the money I won fairly.
- Pseudolus.
- Seven. Eight.
- Where's five and six?
- I'm coming to them. Nine. Five. Six.
Thank you, citizens.
Do not fear, he will be punished.
- Farewell.
- Farewell.
- Now...
- I know, I should be whipped.
Gently. However, my intentions were of the noblest.
Hearing that you were visiting your dear mother,
I wanted to purchase a remembrance... some bath essence, a new spear.
Fifty more lashes for lying.
You were doing what you always do... seeking money to buy your freedom.
Freedom? Oh, madam, who would want to be free of you?
Who indeed?
- Hysterium?
- My mistress calls.
Slave-in-chief, drag this man home and beat him without mercy.
- I shall be brutal.
- Good. Up.
We go to buy a breeder slave. Attend to him, Hysterium, my slave of slaves.
I live to grovel. I shall lash him to pulp.
I shall wear out eight whips.
Strong men will blanch.
My arm will...
Come along. They're all from
Gaul and they're all from Egypt.
You, sir... and you.
Come along now, gents. They're all fresh in today. Don't waste my time.
No? Try Fertilla the Populator.
300 pounds of fertile flesh.
Has produced 18 healthy little slaves, and is capable of producing 18 more.
You won't regret it.
Oh!
It is time we were gone. Senex?
Hysterium?
Ah, here you are. And there I am. A gift for my mother on the anniversary of her birth.
104 and not an organ in working condition.
- Will it please her?
- The craftsmanship is superb.
- And the likeness?
- Frightening.
We go.
Hysterium, here are my husband's final instructions. Watch over our son Hero.
Keep him cheerful, well fed and far from the opposite sex.
He must learn sometime.
When that time comes, you shall teach him... what little you know.
Above all, do not let his eyes stray to that house next door. I hold you responsible.
- Rather than let you down, I would die.
- That is what I had in mind.
- Furthermore...
- We are on our way.
- We are on our way.
- Come, Senex. Carry my bust with pride.
Yes, dear. A lesson to remember: never fall in love during a total eclipse.
Thank you, sir.
- Where is Hero?
- He's in his room, studying with his tutor.
"The sun and the moon revolve around the Earth, as do the four planets."
"Above all there is a great blue bowl, which is the sky. There are many stars..."
"..capable of much pleasure, among which the brushing of a flower..."
"Many stars have been named by the Egyptian astronomers, but we have developed our modern system of astronomy from the Greeks."
Who, as you know, were very poor scholars.
"The Earth is a flat platform of ground that meets..."
Take this message of my love to she who has captured my heart.
That breeder woman, has she been thrown a mate yet?
Alas, she refuses just any slave.
She demands to choose.
Choose? She'll breed and like it, like everyone else. Almost everyone.
We caught your runaway slave. Now he dare challenge our right to execute him.
I'm a family slave. What's the good of that if you're executed by strangers?
- He is correct. We shall torture him.
- See how they look after their own?
Hold your tongue.
Thank you, Officer.
Now, what can we devise?
Something suitable and lingering.
- May I suggest...?
- You may not.
- Hang him.
- Hanging is too good for him.
- Much too good.
- By the feet?
That doesn't hurt much.
Hanging by the feet while being lashed. They hate that.
They should hate that. If I suggest that we try to find some other method, it is only because I happen to be completely impervious to physical pain, and I can't stand the thought of spoiling your pleasure.
- I thought you were impervious to pain.
- Not my own.
Ah!
- You like him?
- I like him.
Have him. Congratulations, your life has been spared.
May it be long, healthy and productive.
Productive as a breeder?
Hang me.
This is your house. Come, come.
Well, visit at any time, dear neighbour.
No obligation to buy, just come in and browse.
Senex! Come away from that house of shame.
I was only just standing here and saying "Shame, shame."
For your own good,
Hysterium, look after Hero.
Shh!
- What brings you up here?
- I was trying to get in...
In there? You must never know what goes on in that house.
- But I do know.
- You do? Isn't it amazing?
- Pseudolus, I'm in love!
- Well, that's very...
In love? You? Who is she?
Sometimes you can see her in that window.
A common courtesan in the house of Lycus?
- Is that disgraceful?
- It doesn't sound like an achievement.
I don't care. I will give anything for her. Anything.
- You really love that girl?
- Oh!
I like the way you said that.
Master Hero, you cannot buy her... at your age you're not allowed to buy her... but suppose someone with tremendous cunning could arrange for her to be yours.
Yes.
If that someone could arrange it, what would you give me?
I will give you everything I own.
But what do you own? 20 minae, a collection of seashells... and me.
Yes.
Forget about the minae and the seashells. Just give me me.
- Give you you?
- My freedom.
Pseudolus, people do not go around freeing slaves every day.
Be the first, start a fashion.
- Get me that girl.
- And if I do?
- You are free.
- I am what?
- Free.
- Free!
If I've told you once I've told you a hundred times, do not fan the girls when they're wet!
But you'll never learn.
You'll be a eunuch all your life.
Oh! You bitch!
I know that sound. And I love it.
Ugh! You. How did you come into money?
An unexpected legacy.
My uncle Simo, the Carthaginian elephant breeder, came to an untimely end.
He was crushed to death on the last day of the mating season.
- This morning I bought my freedom.
- Congratulations... citizen.
With this much left over for one gross indulgence.
Lycus, I am in the market for a lifetime companion.
I say in all modesty, I have an assortment of beauty second to none, and... Who?
My former young master.
Thought I'd further his education.
He's bored with picture books.
You understand?
Who better than I?
Come in, little boy, won't you?
Eunuchs, quickly. A buyer!
Was 1 a good year?
Now, for your approval and possible purchase, from out of the East, with the face of an idol, the arms of a willow tree, the pelvis of a camel:
Tintinabula.
Was this the one?
No.
Don't you have anyone in there a bit less noisy?
I have.
Vibrata. A desert bloom of indescribable beauty. Lithe as a tigress.
Wondrous as a flamingo. For he whose interest is the wildlife.
Thank you.
- No.
- Uh!
Frankly, I was hoping to live past my wedding night. She seems a bit too...
No matter. I understand.
Consider the Gemini: a matched pair.
Look at them... either one a divinely assembled woman, together, an infinite number of mathematical possibilities.
No.
I'm a man of limited means, and I don't suppose you'd want to break up a set.
I couldn't. You do understand?
Completely. Do go on.
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on.
Enough! I know what you want.
Behold Panacea.
Panacea, whose face holds a thousand promises, and a body that stands behind each promise.
No.
Don't misunderstand... it's the proportions.
I love the breadth, it's the length.
She may be the right length, but is she right for me? You see what I mean?
- Isn't she a bit too short?
- Definitely not.
- Too tall?
- That's where you're perfect together.
Yes, but how often will we find ourselves in this position?
No need to compromise.
My final offering: Gymnasia, the silent woman.
A giant stage upon which a thousand dramas may be played.
You can speak with her?
Whilst a child I had a nurse from the Isle of Silent Women.
- May I have my foot back?
- You poor child.
- Pseudolus!
- Yes, darling?
Do you want your freedom?
- More than ever. I'll take her.
- That's not the one.
But yours isn't here. It's not nice to walk out without buying...
I want my...
If you must squabble, do it in a place of less character.
I know your type: shoppers.
Please don't touch the merchandise.
It shows every mark.
Courtesans, back to your quarters.
I'll be back for noonday prayers.
Move. Do you mind? Out! Please, quickly, out. Both of you, go.
- Quickly, out. Out.
- There she is!
One moment. Did I not just spy a golden head with sky-blue eyes on yon balcony?
Oh, that one. A recent arrival from Crete. A virgin.
- A virgin.
- Is that good?
- Only today she was sold.
- Sold?
Then receive, O bosom, thy fatal blade.
Behave yourself. She was sold?
Yes. To the agents of a Roman captain.
He claims her this very day.
- Today!
- She cost 500 minae.
- Then receive, O bosom, thy...
- Put your bosom away.
- You say she just arrived from Crete?
- Yes.
I hope the captain is kind to her.
She deserves a bit of affection before...
- Tragic, is it not?
- What? What's tragic?
- The news from Crete.
- What news?
Why should I darken your day?
Farewell, Lycus.
- What is the news?
- What news?
- The news from Crete?
- You force me to tell you.
Crete is being ravaged by a plague.
People are dying by the thousands.
This girl is healthy.
She smiles through the day.
I thought you knew... when they smile, the end is near.
- No.
- Yes.
I'm told it is lovely now in Crete... everyone lying there, smiling.
Is it... is it contagious?
- You ever see a plague that wasn't?
- What about my other girls?
You'd best get her out of here.
- Yes. But where? How?
- I'll take her before the captain arrives.
Capital! I'll go fetch her.
Why should you risk...?
Because I've already had the plague.
I would tell you all about it, but...
No. I'll go fetch her.
Don't go away.
Pseudolus, I'm to be with her!
- Until the captain arrives this forenoon.
- Yes.
- Wait.
- Yes?
- A brilliant idea.
- Yes!
That's what we need, a brilliant idea.
Go, go! Get a move on. No, don't touch that pillar. Go, go.
Mind your breathing... just inhale. Go, go.
Pseudolus, how kind you are.
I shall not forget this.
Someday I shall repay you, for you, Pseudolus, are a true friend.
And you, Lycus, are a gentleman and a procurer.
Psst!
To the garden, and break the news that you're gonna run away to marry her.
- Won't I catch the plague?
- There is no plague. We made that up.
- Clever of us.
- Wasn't it?
I'll hie myself to the harbour to hire a boat. Hoe you to the garden.
You hie... and I'll hoe.
Good luck.
- My name is Hero.
- My name is Philia.
- I've often seen you.
- I've often seen you, too.
I've watched you undressing at night.
Only from the waist up. It's a high window.
You have beautiful legs.
What?
Oh.
You do, too.
I imagine, I mean.
I would show them to you, but they're sold.
I cost 500 minae. Is that a lot of money?
- Yes.
- More than 300?
- Nearly twice as much.
- Three and five, they always mix me up.
I hope the captain doesn't expect me to do adding.
You can't add?
We're taught charm and grace, and no more. I cannot add or spell or anything.
I have but one talent.
I'm lovely
All I am is lovely
Lovely is the one thing I can do
Winsome
What I am is winsome
Radiant as in some dream come true
Oh
Isn't it a shame?
I can neither sew nor cook
Nor read nor write my name
But I'm happy
Merely being lovely
For it's one thing
I can give to you
Philia, say my name.
- Just say your name?
- Yes.
Very well, then.
I've forgotten it.
It's Hero.
Forgive me, Hero.
I've no memory for names.
You don't need one.
You don't need anything.
You're lovely
Absolutely lovely
Who'd believe the loveliness of you?
Winsome
Sweet and warm and winsome
Radiant as in some dream come true
Now Venus would seem tame
Helen and her thousand ships would have to die of shame
And I'm happy
- Happy that I'm lovely
- Happy that you're lovely
For there's one thing loveliness can do
It's a gift for me to share
With you
Psst! Psst!
Master Hero, put that down.
Hysterium, this is Philia.
Never mind who she is, who is she?
Where did you find her?
- In the house of Lycus.
- A courtesan? No!
- I am a virgin.
- Of course.
Master Hero, bid farewell to this person so that she can go about her... business.
- No, no, no. Pseudolus said...
- Pseudolus? I might have known it!
A passage to Thessaly for two at the first tide.
- In one hour.
- Good. Now, care to play for the boat?
How dare you! Arranging an assignation between a boy and a you-know-what!
There's something about that you-know-what you know not.
- What do I know not?
- That girl is my daughter.
- Your what?
- You've heard me speak of her.
- Never. That girl is not your daughter.
- My sister?
- I go tell his parents.
- Wait!
He insisted on meeting her, but she was sold to a captain who claims her today.
What can happen in an hour?
At his age? The mind boggles.
I go tell his parents.
- I go with you.
- You wait till I tell them about you.
No. You wait till I tell them about you.
Tell them what about me?
I am a pillar of virtue.
It may be of interest that their pillar of virtue, their slave-in-chief, has secreted in his cubicle Rome's most extensive collection of erotic pottery.
When did you acquire that large fruit bowl with the frieze of the...?
Pseudolus...
- Neither of us is perfect.
- If it is only for an hour or so.
Where's the harm? Especially with the master and mistress safely out of the way.
I'm worried about Hero. Perhaps I should go back and keep a fatherly eye...
Senex!
- Stop!
- Whoa!
- I saw that.
- I was stung by a bee.
- Oh, my nose!
- We shall have to have it resharpened.
Here?
I suppose I could hasten back to the stonecutter and join you tomorrow mor...
No. The trip would tire me.
I should be exhausted.
You shall go back, you selfish toad. Now.
But, my love, I don't know how I shall survive the long lonely night without you.
You'll just have to force yourself.
I've just been to the harbour.
We must hurry.
- Are you going somewhere?
- No, but you are.
I cannot go.
Why can you not?
While the captain has a contract, I must go with him. I must honour my contract.
An honest virgin.
What a terrible combination.
Excuse me. We'll give her a little knock on the head and...
No, I will not use force against her.
Venus, why did you bring us together only to part us?
Be brave, Hero.
For us, there will never be happiness.
Then we must learn to be happy without it.
When will the captain take me?
In due time you will be taken, but not in the garden.
- Inside.
- How shall I know it's him?
He will knock on the door three times.
Go on upstairs and wait.
My mistress's bedroom, the green one.
Go, go. Up, up, up. Go, go, go. Master...
Master, she will go with you, I promise.
She's gone. Good.
Then I'll get you a nice plump peahen. We must try to get your appetite back to food.
- Our passport to freedom.
- What is it?
I lifted Hysterium's book of potions. We'll mix a sleeping potion in a beaker of wine.
We'll give it to the girl to drink and tell Lycus she died of the plague.
You hie her to the boat.
I hie me to the hills... free!
- Brilliant!
- Not brilliant, just... Well, yes, brilliant.
I just remembered something frightening.
I cannot read. Find the sleeping potions, quickly. The ingredients, quickly.
- Eye of an eel.
- That we have.
- Heart of a snail.
- That we have.
- A cup of mare sweat.
- That we have not.
Mare sweat. Where will we find mare sweat on a day like this?
Quick! You to the north, I to the south.
- This is exciting.
- Isn't it? Go!
Follow me!
- That way.
- Yes, yes.
The green bedroom?
Knock three times?
The captain.
Take me. Take me.
- I beg your pardon?
- Take me.
Just a moment.
Now, what did you say?
Take me, my body is yours.
Is this not what you want?
- It has crossed my mind.
- But you must know something.
Yes?
Though you may have my body, you shall never have my heart.
You can't have everything.
A thousand thanks... whichever one of you did this.
Would you believe it? There was a mare sweating not two streets from here.
- Looks more like his father every day.
- Pseudolus, he's here.
- No.
- Remember where we stopped.
- Sir, you're back.
- She almost broke it. Who is she?
You may well ask. "Who is she?" you ask, as well you may.
- Delightful.
- I await your bidding.
- My bid...
- Ever your servant.
- Ever my servant.
- That's it. Your servant. Your new maid.
- New maid? She seems very loyal.
- Very courteous, efficient, thoughtful.
Maids like me. I'm neat.
I like maids. They're neat.
Everybody ought to have a maid
Everybody ought to have a working girl
Everybody ought to have a lurking girl
To potter around the house
Everybody ought to have a maid
Everybody ought to have a menial
Consistently congenial
And quieter than a mouse
Oh, oh, wouldn't she be delicious
Tidying up the dishes, neat as a pin?
Oh, oh, wouldn't she be delightful, sweeping out?
Sleeping in
Everybody ought to have a maid
Someone who when fetching you your slipper
Will be winsome as a whippoorwill
And graceful as a grouse
Fluttering up the stairways, shuttering up the windows
Cluttering up the bedroom, buttering up the master
Puttering all around the house
- A maid?
- A maid.
- A maid?
- A maid.
Everybody ought to have a maid
Everybody ought to have a serving girl
A loyal and unswerving girl
Who's quieter than a mouse
Oh, oh, think of her at the dustbin
'Specially when she's just been traipsing about
Oh, oh, wouldn't she be delightful, living in?
Giving out
Everybody ought to have a maid
Someone who you hire when you're short of help
To offer you the sort of help you never get from a spouse
- Pattering through the attic
- Chattering in the cellar
- Clattering in the kitchen
- Flattering in the bedroom
Pottering all around the house
The virgin, how is she?
- A maid.
- A maid.
- A maid.
- A maid?
Everybody ought to have a maid
Someone who's efficient and reliable
Obedient and pliable and quieter than a mouse
Oh, oh, wouldn't she be so nimble
Fiddling with a thimble, mending a gown?
Oh, oh, wouldn't she be delightful, cleaning up?
Leaning down
Everybody ought to have a maid
Someone who'll be busy as a bumblebee
And even if you grumble
Be as graceful as a grouse
- Wriggling in the anteroom
- Jiggling in the living room
- Giggling in the dining room
- Wiggling in the other rooms
Pottering all around the house
The virgin, how is she?
Tell me, I want to know how she...
- The house
- How is the virgin?!
The house
She's very low. Remember the smile?
It's now nearly a grin.
I pray she lasts. I had a bad experience with an officer to whom I had sold a virgin.
- What happened?
- She turned out to be a dud.
A dud virgin? How could that happen?
You see, the fellow who sold me the dud virgin also sold me a dud eunuch.
- I'll keep this one alive as long as I can.
- You're a saint.
I shall instruct the new maid in housework. Starting in my room.
But, sir, your son may be in that very house.
Oh, dear.
- Sir, this house is empty.
- So it is, sir.
Before your friend Erronius went abroad in search of his children stolen by pirates, he asked you to look into his house.
Yes. Now might be as good a time as any. Send the girl in here.
But, sir. Only my deepest devotion to you allows me to speak so frankly.
You have trudged the road some way, and
I fear that this great physical exertion...
Great heavens. Is that me?
I smell like an overheated horse.
I must bathe.
At least. Shall I send the girl to you, say, in one hour?
At least.
Home at last. After years of searching for my long lost children, how good it is to see this street once more.
These tired old eyes fill with tears at the sight of the little they see.
Pardon me, young woman.
I'm sorry, but I...
Oh, what a lovely baby.
Just about the age of my children when they were stolen in infancy by pirates.
But at least I have the comforts of my lonely home.
Sir!
- Who are you?
- Hysterium, sir. Servant to Senex.
Oh, everybody ought to have...
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.
Oh, oh...
I didn't hear that either.
- It was an eerie sound.
- Eerie sound?
Like the house was haunted.
Sir, what I'm about to tell you is eerie.
Your house is haunted.
- Haunted?
- Haunted as the day is long.
Perhaps you should stay with relatives, distant relatives.
Yes. No. Fetch me a soothsayer.
- A soothsayer?
- He must search my house at once.
Sir, you're in need of a soothsayer.
- How did you know?
- I'd be a fine soothsayer if I didn't.
- There's a spirit in my hou...
- Silence!
I'm about to say the sooth.
You... I see it. I see everything.
You... you have been... abroad for...
20 years. You have been... searching for... a child.
No, two childs.
A fine big boy... and a strange little boy.
No, no.
A girl! A girl. A boy and a girl.
- Can you find them for me?
- Certainly I can find them.
Each wear a ring that has engraved upon it a gaggle of geese.
There are only two more like this in the world, and my children wear them.
- How many geese in a gaggle?
- At least seven.
Seven?! Before I say the sooth again, you must run seven times around the Seven Hills of Rome.
- And the spirit?
- It will be gone after you do my bidding.
- Thanks.
- To the hills!
- To the hills.
- Oh.
- This is the way, sir.
- Thank you, young woman.
Sir, sir! You forgot your gaggle!
You see? Everything is turning out fine.
When the master thinks the virgin's a maid, the virgin thinks she's his mistress, and the mistress doesn't know about her son?
See that the master stays in the bath the next hour, and I'll get the girl out of here.
- How soon?
- When Hero brings more mare sweat.
Mare sweat?!
There's no need to remind me.
I need some more bath towels at once.
Be patient, my dear. I shall not keep you panting long.
Come on, you rotten slave, move.
Pick those chains up. Come on!
Ah, thank you, lad.
It is thirsty work.
That's mine.
Ah!
- Yes?
- Is this the house of Marcus Lycus?
- Yes.
- Then aside, eunuch.
Inform Lycus we would see him at once.
Yes, possibilities. Carry on.
Was that a customer, dear eunuch?
Welcome, most noble warrior. Won't you come in? Perhaps some wine. Perhaps...
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We are emissaries from he for whom a maiden was purchased from you.
A maiden.
She'll be claimed within the hour by our illustrious captain, Miles Gloriosus.
I know that name.
I don't think I like it.
The mighty Miles bids you know that he did purchase a maiden from scum such as yourself some years ago.
This so-called maiden delivered proof that she'd been nothing of the sort.
- Accidents will happen.
- But never again to the great Gloriosus.
Should anything be amiss with your maiden, he'll seize your entire stock.
- That's fair.
- And then he'll burn down your house.
- Reasonable.
- Then he'll...
No, no. Inform the captain the maid will be ready and very willing and very healthy.
Ah!
With just a slight touch of plague.
Excuse me. Have you seen a handsome youth running after a sweating horse?
Very generous of you, sir.
Excuse me, madam. A cool youth and a hot mare, have you by any chance...?
Most kind of you, madam.
Sir, might I ask...?
Thank you humbly, sir.
Master Hero has been here.
Thank you kindly, sir.
I'm sorry, I can't stop now. I...
You've been sold? To whom?
A Syrian shepherd? He's collecting you within the hour.
I may never see her again. Listen.
In a few...
In a few... Listen carefully!
Aahh!
In one hour the captain arrives.
How can I save my head?
One hour before the Syrian shepherd arrives. How can I save Gymnasia?
If I could find someone to take my place for an hour. But who?
If I could but take Lycus's place for one hour. But how?
Excuse me. Not at all.
- Pseudolus.
- Lycus.
Hail, Marcus Lycus.
I was looking for you.
But I was looking for you.
- Isn't that amazing?
- Fantastic.
It's about the girls...
Did you say "It's about the girls?"
- Yes. Did you?
- Yes.
- Amazing.
- Fantastic.
You see, it occurred to me when you were in my place...
- That I didn't have time...
- ..To decide...
- ..about choosing a wife.
- Precisely. What a marvellous rapport.
- Amazing.
- Fantastic.
And so I was thinking...
- That I'd spend more time...
- Alone...
..with the girls.
Lycus, you're making me cry.
One other thing.
You see, my father...
- You have a father?
- Yes.
- Isn't that amazing?
- Fantastic.
Furthermore, he's on his way to my house and he thinks I'm just a tradesman.
Poor fellow. But what if, when he arrives, we have moved the girls elsewhere?
Yes. But how to find a suitable elsewhere.
- Where else?
- The house of the good Senex.
Why not? He's out of the way for an hour.
But who will take care of my place? The shepherd comes to buy the silent woman.
I don't suppose, Pseudolus,
I could impose upon you...
To take your place? Pretend that I'm you for an hour?
Lycus, it would be a privilege.
Oh, now you're making me cry.
Oh, one more thing.
The captain who comes for the virgin, should he arrive while I'm gone...
- Mind you, I do not...
- I'll just hand her over.
If she's not alive, fob him off with another girl.
I'm told he's a most kind, gentle and considerate man.
- Have no fears.
- I won't, dear Pseudolus.
And may I say, you will never live to regret this.
Gone to see a nose grinder indeed.
He's cavorting with those courtesans.
- But, Mother, what can I do?
- Do?
Return to Rome immediately, before he can do what no doubt he's already done.
Go!
Come on, now.
Right. Hey, hey!
Hey!
Come on, come on.
Morning.
Quickly, on your feet. The change will do you good. Quick, quick. Out.
- Come quickly.
- You there!
- You there!
- Go, go.
- Oh, there's so much of you there.
- Later, later.
Go, go.
Why do you stand here? Come on, we have no time. Come, come, come, come.
You will be gone before that shepherd arrives. Can you leave immediately?
No arguing. Go away. Come, come.
Oh, Vibrata, really!
Go. Come, come.
First time around.
What was that?
Ho, there. I am seeking the house of Marcus Lycus.
Who is it that reeks the louse of Marcus Leakus?
- Hold, sir!
- Who leaks the louse...?
You're not holding, sir. Who is he that seeks the house of Marcus Lycus?
A foot soldier of Captain
Miles Gloriosus.
- Smartly done.
- Thank you.
My captain dispatches me to inform you that he's half a league away, and bids you honour this.
You know what this is, of course?
Of course I know what this is.
This is... writing.
- This is your contract with the captain.
- A pretty piece of work.
- Thank you.
- What is this word here?
That is "Lycus".
- You realise who you are speaking to?
- Yes, sir.
Do you realise what it says there?
I know what it says there.
Words. I intend to stand behind them or my name is not Marcus Lycus.
Pseudolus!
Or my name is not
Pseudolus Marcus Lycus.
One moment. I must have a word with my eunuch.
- Oh, please.
- Thank you very much.
Come here, eunuch!
Eunuch? How dare you call me that!
You and I know it isn't true, so why do we care what they think?
- Why are you calling yourself Lycus?
- You see...
- Why should I spoil your day?
- How can you spoil a total disaster?
- The captain comes for the girl now.
- That's terrible.
- Why?
- The master also wants her now.
He can't have her! Just keep him in that house.
- But, Pseudolus...
- Lycus.
- But, Pseudolus...
- Lycus.
- But, Pseudolus...
- Lycus. I still know about that pottery.
But, Lycus... Goodbye,
Lycus. Farewell, Lycus.
Good luck, Lycus. He is Lycus.
Tell your captain his bride awaits.
Smartly done.
- Hysterium!
- Sire?
Remember that potion which so fills one with energy one can perform miracles?
Oh, yes, sire. We still have some left from your wedding night.
- Bring me a beaker.
- Yes, master.
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
My bride, my bride,
I've come to claim my bride
Come tenderly to crush her against my side
Let haste be made,
I cannot be delayed
There are lands to conquer, cities to loot, and peoples to degrade
Look at those arms, look at that chest... look at them!
Not to mention the rest... even I am impressed!
My bride, my bride, come, bring to me my bride
My lust for her no longer can be denied
Convey the news
I have no time to lose
There are towns to plunder, temples to burn, and women to abuse
Look at that foot, look at that heel
Mark the magnificent muscles of steel
I am my ideal
I, Miles Gloriosus
I, slaughterer of thousands
I, oppressor of the meek
Subduer of the weak
Degrader of the Greek
Destroyer of the Turk
Must hurry back to work
I, Miles Gloriosus
I, paragon of virtues
I, in war the most admired
In wit the most inspired
In love the most desired
In dress the best displayed
I am a parade
Look at those eyes, cunning and keen
Look at the size of those thighs, like a mighty machine
Those are the mightiest thighs I ever have theen
I mean...
My bride, my bride, inform my lucky bride
The fabled arms of
Miles are open wide
Make haste, make haste,
I have no time to waste
There are shrines I should be sacking, ribs I should be cracking
Eyes to gouge and booty to divide
Bring me my bride
Stand aside, everyone.
I take large steps.
- Hail, Miles Gloriosus!
- You are?
Marcus Lycus. I am dazzled by your presence.
Everyone is. Where is my bride?
It is a sad tale I have to tell the captain. Bad news... Argh!
Did not my aide inform you that should anything be amiss, your house would be burnt, your women seized and your life forfeit?
He didn't. Did he?
- He did.
- He did! And I meant it.
There's been some mistake.
Here! Here is the man you want.
Tell him who I am.
- Everybody knows who you are, Lycus.
- No.
- Tell him who I am. Tell him!
- Rely on me. He is Marcus Lycus.
Not so! He is Lycus.
Sire, if you look within you will find none but hooded men.
We are a holy order, an ancient brotherhood of lepers. Unclean, unclean.
"Unclean, unclean."
- Well, Lycus, what of this bad news?
- There is no bad news.
I only say that so as not to make the gods jealous. She is ugly. Ugly!
Ugly! Ugly!
Really, she's beautiful.
- I did not want them envying you.
- What is she like?
A face so fair, a heart so pure.
Sir, if you had been born a woman, you would have been she.
As magnificent as that?
She will be ready soon. Some food?
That is unnecessary.
I will await her in your house.
- No!
- No?
I meant yes. It just came out no.
- And who are you?
- My chief eunuch, sir.
Just kick him if he offends you.
Surround the house. While I am within, let no one else enter.
What was that all about?
Why didn't you give him the girl?
It's time we two trusted each other.
One of us isn't ready.
Why didn't you give him the girl?
She refuses to go with him. But Master
Hero's out getting her a potion.
So keep the master in his bath until...
Arrange food, drink, entertainment and a sit-down orgy for 14.
These sands will run out in exactly one half-hour.
If my bride is not delivered by then, this house will be an empty patch of ground.
That rotten Lycus!
That lovely Pseudolus.
Mm!
What a glorious day. Won't you join me in a beaker? Everyone, a beaker with me. I...
- Crassus!
- Marcus?
I heard you were abroad in search of pulchritude.
I returned this morn. With as choice a cargo as you've seen.
- Good man.
- From Crete.
Crete? Do not touch me. Do not breathe on me. The plague. The plague!
There's no plague on Crete.
No plague? No one lying around, smiling themselves to death?
- It's the healthiest isle in the world.
- He lied to me, tricked me.
You, tricked?
Yes. But not for long. I go to the captain and see that that swine is killed!
- Which swine?
- The lyingest, cheatingest slave in Rome.
Oh, Pseudolus.
Hmm.
Chapter six.
The Sabine campaign, in which a boy becomes a man.
Laden with the spoils of conquest,
I then set forth for Egypt, little knowing that here waited for me that black-fringed temptress who was to play so great a part in my...
Foot!
Oh, get off, get off, get off!
As you know, at this time all Gaul was divided into eight parts.
Agh! Back, leper. Bring not your contagion into the house of Lycus.
House of...? Pseudolus, tell them who I am. I am no leper. I am Lycus!
Ah, the poor creature. Just jab him back into his den of ill health.
What?
Oh, Pseudolus, I'll have my revenge.
I'll get in to see the captain yet.
This I swear by the great
Necrophites, god of procurers... panderers... and go-betweens.
A new god, but a very hard worker.
"I rely on you, Miles" said Caesar firmly. "Hold that Tiber."
Yes, that's good. "Hold that... hold that Tiber."
If you see a lad with mare sweat, send him up to the green bedroom.
Not down there!
When I heard the revellers,
I thought my captain had come.
He has, but he's not ready yet.
Just wait in there. Wait. Wait, wait!
That's what virgins are supposed to do best.
- My man has come for me.
- Good. Where is he?
Wait, my little one.
I must wash my hands.
I shall be back in a nonce.
At most, two nonces.
I shall knock on the door three times.
- Where'd she go?
- In there.
Knock three times and she's yours.
One, two, three.
Four.
The hourglass!
Sir... May I suggest, sir, just one more scrub?
No, that's enough. One more scrub and you'll wash away my enthusiasm.
All right, now. I want everybody...
Listen, will you?!
When I say push, push hard.
Push terribly hard. Push!
No entry? I live, eat and sleep here every day of my life.
Congratulations. But today it's officers only.
Master, the passion potion.
You must drink it while it's hot.
If you are the new gardeners, don't lean on those things, get to work.
Where is it? Where is my passion potion?
Where is everyone? Senex?
Pseudolus? Hysterium?
Madam!
Where is my husband? On good intuition,
I believe he is fouling the nest.
And he has brought in the legions to help. Who are all these people?
Madam, the hospitality of your house is being enjoyed by Miles Gloriosus.
- The Gloriosus?
- The The himself.
He requested a rest in your charming residence.
As a general's daughter,
I hoped you would not object.
Object? Pseudolus, you have acted well.
I must greet this captain at once.
Captain Gloriosus, I am shattered that
I was not here to greet you personally.
- You are of this house?
- For many, many years.
My father, you know,
Captain, was General Magnus.
On the last anniversary of his death,
I entertained over 200 officers.
200? By yourself?
Not entirely. Hysterium here was a great help.
Oh, Hysterium, thoughtful as ever.
My mouth is dry after that dusty drive.
Mad... Oh...
After I've bathed and changed this dusty robe, I want you to ask the captain to...
Where did you say my husband was?
I, uh... Your hus...
He is... he is...
Well, at the moment he is, uh...
He is, uh... he is... At least, when I last saw him he was.
I want to know if my husband is in the house.
No, but he should be here soon. Madam, might I suggest you take your bath now?
I shall send slaves with a fresh robe.
When he arrives, keep him busy downstairs.
And tell the captain I shall be awaiting him in the green room, after my bath.
- What do we do?
- I'll deal with the master.
You keep that hourglass from running out, and I'll be grateful to you as long as I live.
If I live that long.
Master!
- All right, where is she?
- Who?
- The new maid.
- Oh, the maid? The very new maid?
Knock three times and she's yours.
- Ah! What about my passion potion?
- Start without.
- House of Lycus?
- Yes. What about it?
Acrobats for the orgy.
- That way.
- Thanks.
Back to the peeling.
Sorry, wrong maid.
Quickly, quickly. We must find another room for you.
- My filly!
- My stallion!
- My wife.
- My husband.
My gods!
You're late. The others are waiting for you in there.
- Entertainers that way.
- I must see the captain. Very important.
- Entertainers that way!
- Captain...
Listen. Do you know what happened to the last underling who interrupted the captain in mid-debauch?
- Entertainers this way.
- Yes.
- Where is Hero?
- Calm.
- How is the mistress?
- Calm.
What happened to the master?
Why is the virgin...?
Calm yourself! Calm! I'll tell you when it's time to panic!
- I smell mischief.
- It's time.
Someone has tampered with this.
- Bring me my bride.
- She'll be ready soon.
They are just anointing her with unguents to make her ankle bangle dangle.
Meanwhile, for your further entertainment...
Bring on the acrobats!
"Ankle bangle dangle"
Watch there, the Four
Tumbling Tuscans.
Psst! Lycus!
That one is very good. He really makes it look as though he landed on his head.
Would you like to see that man again?
That man again for the captain.
Captain, I have news. The...
Waaaah!
Captain, please. I... Captain, the virgin is... Captain, a word.
Louder music. The captain wants louder music.
I'm not happy in my work, Captain.
Have you ever seen a jester like this?
The remarks he makes!
- He's the best I've ever seen.
- But his exit.
- Do the flying exit.
- What?!
Waaaah!
- Didn't I tell you you'd enjoy this?
- I did, yes.
You are a good fellow. It's really going to pain me to kill you.
- Kill me?
- Indeed, Lycus.
- If she is not at my feet in two minutes.
- Could you make it five?
- Two.
- Two. Two minutes.
Philia! Phil... Philia!
- You go to the captain now, like it or not.
- But I've been ready.
But Pseudolus said you refused to. Come.
Bring me that girl or you'll all perish!
That's not a happy captain.
- That voice. I know that voice.
- Of course you do. That's your captain.
That's not my captain. That's the brute who raped my country, Thrace.
He raped Thrace?
- Then he came and did it again and again.
- He raped Thrace thrice?
I'm not going with him.
- Will you now go with Hero?
- Oh, yes, yes.
Go back to Hero's room and wait there.
- He'll burn our house.
- Fear not. I have a plan.
I don't want to hear it.
- We tell the captain the virgin has died.
- I think I heard that.
- We'll need a body. Anybody's body.
- Get one from Gusto the body snatcher.
He owes me a favour.
But he died yesterday.
- What about his body?
- Somebody snatched it.
- Who do we know that's dead?
- I wish I was.
I'm a disgrace to my family.
My father will turn in his grave.
Your father is alive.
This will kill him.
Just lie down. It'll be all over in one moment.
- You're delicious.
- What if he tries to kiss me?
- He won't kiss you.
- How can he help it if I'm so delicious?
Come back here.
Just lie still. Lie still.
The captain will see you, shudder, and go on his way heartbroken.
It'll never work.
Look at me. Just look at me.
I can't take my eyes off you.
You're lovely
Absolutely lovely
Who'd believe the loveliness of you?
- No!
- Get back here and lie down.
Perfect
Sweet and warm and winsome
Radiant as in some dream come true
Now Venus will seem tame
Helen and her thousand ships will have to die of shame
You're so lovely
Frighteningly lovely
That the world will never seem the same
I'm lovely
Absolutely lovely
Who'd believe the loveliness of me?
I would.
Perfect
Sweet and warm and winsome
Radiant as in some dream come true
Now...
- Shouldn't I have some jewellery?
- Jewellery? Well, I...
- Erronius's gaggle.
- Ah!
I'm so lovely
Literally lovely
That the world will never seem the same
You're so lovely
That the world will never seem the same
Now I go get the pallbearers. Wait here.
- I'll never get away with it.
- You will. It's easy.
Just lie still and think dead thoughts.
The time is up! Ransack the house!
Oh, woe. Oh, woe.
Oh, woe.
And "Oh, woe" again.
Ha! For the last time, where is my bride?
For the very last time, here is your bride.
Here on this appalling pall, dead.
Dead, permanently dead.
Dead, dead.
O monstrous fate!
My sweet innocent bride... dead.
Yes. Give her air!
- How did she die?
- She rolled over and...
No, no. How did it happen?
One glimpse of your grandeur from above, the shock was too much.
Poor child, a virgin till the end.
A lot of good it did you.
- Spare me. I cannot control my tears.
- Go ahead. It's nature's release.
Her bridal bower becomes a burial bier of bitter bereavement.
Very good.
Can you say "Titus the tailor told ten tall tales to Titania the titmouse"?
Do not try to cheer me.
I am inconsolable.
- Why torture yourself? Just go.
- Yes.
Yes. Poor girl... to have died so young without ever having experienced me.
Well...
No. I cannot leave without giving her the comfort of a proper funeral service.
Do you have time? Isn't there a war you should be starting?
- Silence!
- Silence!
I insist on conducting a funeral.
Summon mourners.
Mourners. Mourners? Back.
Back, back, back.
- A funeral?
- A rapid requiem, a quick dirge.
- But any coins he puts on my eyes I keep.
- Done.
I certainly have been.
Gather firewood.
She shall be cremated.
Uh...
You're to take that immediately up to the green bedroom.
- Son!
- Father!
My passion potion.
No! It...
It's not his potion.
Forgive me for ever mistrusting you, my darling.
But you have been a little distant these past 29 years.
I shall compose a funeral dirge.
Oh, do. A nice short one.
Gather round, handmaidens of sorrow
Sound the flute
Blow the horn
Pluck the lute
Forward mourn
Ah, ah
All Crete was at her feet
All Thrace was in her thrall
All Sparta loved her sweetness
- And Gaul
- And Spain
- And Greece
- And Egypt
- And Syria
- And Mesopotamia
- What's that?
- It's a funeral.
Oh. Somebody's dead, eh?
The captain's maiden.
The captain's maiden?!
- She's dead.
- Yeah.
Then I shall kill myself.
It's against Roman law to take one's own life. The penalty's death.
- I'll fight a gladiator, then.
- You might win.
Yeah.
I shall throw myself to the lions.
Speak the spells
Chant the chants
Toll the bells!
Fold the arms.
On behalf of the body, I'd like to thank you for a lovely funeral.
I don't know about you, but I've suffered enough.
So I suggest you depart, and I shall take the body and...
- Second dirge.
- Second dirge!
Throw himself to the lions!
Then I too must die.
Today's the day of the human sacrifice at the temple of the vestal virgins.
I shall go and offer myself to the gods.
- Hey, see that?
- Yes, but look at that!
What's your hurry?
Would you lower your pike to your captain's plaything?
Captain? I've had no instructions.
The captain sent for me especially.
Let me by, and... I'll redeem this in ways that will melt every bolt in your armour.
- Is it real?
- Bite it and see.
And that goes for me, too.
Strew the soil
Strum the lyre
Spread the oil
Build the pyre
Pyre? What kind of pyre?
A pyre of fire.
Oh, a fire pyre.
- She must be burnt.
- Burnt?
- I want her ashes.
- Ashes? Oh!
Captain! Captain.
Captain, I implore you. It is not for us to destroy such loveliness.
The gods are awaiting her. They would be angry if we sent up a smoked virgin.
- I cannot afford to offend the gods.
- Who can?
I will go my melancholy way.
Very good, sir. Goodbye, sir.
Wait.
A farewell kiss.
Of course.
Not you.
You mustn't. It could make you very sick.
She died of an illness contracted in Crete.
- What illness?
- The plague.
- The plague!
- Plague!
Run for your lives!
- Silence!
- Silence! Shh!
- There is no plague.
- What?
I have this day returned from
Crete and there is no plague.
Then what was everyone yelling about?
Find me the captain.
Don't stand there.
You, find me the captain.
Sir, I bring wonderful news.
The virgin does not have the plague.
Silence, woman. I know that.
She died of other causes.
Died? She was a bab... How...?
Poor little moth. She fluttered too near my flame.
- Too filled with love, dear little heart.
- Heart.
Yes, that's it. I shall cut out her heart and carry it with me for evermore.
- She's alive!
- And will stay that way!
- Treachery! Treason! Seize her!
- I'll get her.
Seize everyone! Put the whole neighbourhood to the sword!
Sir, a question. If I found your maiden, would you spare my...
A moment.
If the maiden is not found,
I shall destroy not only this house, but all surrounding houses and every single person in them!
- And now, your question.
- It was just a silly girlish idea.
I'll find your maiden.
Ah! Now then, my beauty, redeem your promise.
You wildcat, you're beautiful when you're angry.
- Ruined! Ruined!
- We have to find Hero and Philia.
Oh, look! Do you see what she said?
What is it? And please don't tell me.
Philia's sacrificing herself and
Hero's throwing himself to the lions.
Come, Gymnasia. Hie you to the temple for Philia.
I'll save Hero and meet you there!
The same thing happened 29 years ago.
I might just as well live in a temple.
I'll wager you never got my nose sharpened.
I would like to know what it is you do that makes you so tired. I noticed you're...
Here. Hey.
I wish to throw myself to the lions.
Where do I go?
- Pompeii?
- I beg your pardon?
No performance here today.
Gladiators are just training.
- Training?
- Training.
Come on, you miserable slave, move!
- Here you are, lot four.
- Straight in.
All right.
Move, you slaves. Move.
Move!
Oh, dear, come along. Keep moving.
Over there. Get in line. In line.
How are you? All right?
Had a good day?
Hero! Master Hero! Wait here.
Hey! We're closed to members of the public.
That young man that went in, I must see him.
You'll see him. They should be bringing him out any minute.
- Now, the secret of the action...
- Hm?
The secret of the action is in the wrist.
You see, it's got to flow.
You're jerking.
No, no. You see, think of it as an extension of your arm.
You tightened up, didn't you?
You're worrying about it too much.
Try and just do a couple without thinking about it, eh? Go on.
Ah!
That even felt better, didn't it?
- I'm always better in trainin'.
- Yes.
Now, don't worry, don't worry. Just...
No, no. Relax, relax.
You see, he sort of... went...
Very strange. Right.
No. Wrist jerk again.
Oh, much better, yes. You've got a natural swing, you know.
Uh, please. Do you mind?
No. That's a nasty, messy one.
That fellow whistling put you off.
Here's the last one.
Never mind. Let's see if we can put this one straight into Nero's box.
Psst!
Uh, please, please.
Do you mind?
Still jerking the wrist.
Hero, Hero.
Philia's alive. She's at the temple of virgins. Go, go now. Save her. Go. Go.
Hyargh!
Give it!
Yah, yah. Yah!
Hyargh!
Come!
Oh! Miles!
There they are!
And now a moment of silence before our daughter starts her final voyage.
Psst! Philia!
Huh?
Here, here.
Hero. My Hero.
No mortal sounds must interfere.
But I thought he was dead.
I must go to him. I love him.
- Yes. Now.
- So be it.
Run along, child.
Bring another victim to the altar.
Come on!
Master Hero, wait!
Master Hero, wait!
My freedom! You promised!
Look, there they are.
Master Hero, wait!
Your parents. I promised!
Hero, wait! The captain.
I promised!
Come on!
The most refreshing climate in the world.
Look out!
Come back!
Take that! And that! And that!
Get away!
Duck!
Whoa!
Help. Help!
Jump. Jump!
Jump. Jump!
Jump!
Hold me close.
It makes me feel so strong.
Personally, I'm not quite ready to make up yet. What?
You want her, you take her.
That's far enough! Look out!
Oh, Hero, help!
I'm awfully sorry. Thank you.
Oh, you breed of Eve!
Darling! Hit me again, darling.
No, no!
Wait! Stop!
Whoa!
No, no! Don't whoa!
Right! Now back to Rome for a quick wedding and some slow executions.
You, slave! You will torn apart by a team of wild horses, slowly, to the plaudits of my troops and the amusement of the children.
But you, my dear, have nothing to fear.
For, though you fled from me,
I have the greatness to forgive.
I, too, can forgive.
No one can part us now.
Show me the swine who did that and
I'll break every bone in his body.
Third time around.
Pardon me, madam.
The gaggle! My precious.
My beautiful.
My sweet.
Why do older men find me so attractive?
The family ring. My daughter.
- My virgin?
- I am not a virgin.
Those filthy pirates!
And I am not your daughter.
I'm an Etruscan dancer.
- You are my virgin.
- My daughter.
- My virgin!
- My...
Ye gods! The eunuch.
- My daughter, a eunuch?
- Soldier, seize that man!
Captain, I can explain.
- This can't be she.
- What?
The leper. Unclean! Unclean!
I am no leper, and no woman.
I, sire, am Marcus Lycus. Hold.
Here. Here is your virgin.
And worth the waiting for.
I don't understand it.
The ring, the gaggle of geese.
What did you say, old man? I have worn this ring since I was a foundling child.
- My son!
- Father!
You've grown.
- Are these many geese a gaggle?
- How long have you had that?
Since... I don't know when I've had this since.
- My daughter!
- My sister.
- My courtesan.
- My maid.
- My brother-in-law.
- My Gymnasia.
Oh, no. No! That girl I still own.
One moment. I take it your daughter was freeborn?
- Without a doubt.
- Lycus, we all know the penalty for selling a freeborn citizen.
Seize him.
Careful. I'm a bleeder.
However, he has not only given me a marvellous wedding present... a wife, especially a silent one... he's also promised me
10,000 minae as a dowry.
Ten...
No.
Such generosity should not go unrewarded.
- Very well. Spare him.
- Hero!
Father and Mother, I wish to marry.
Son, if you're as happy as your mother and
I have been... my heart bleeds for you.
Lovers divided get coincided
Something for everyone
A comedy tonight
Father and mother get one another
Something for everyone
A tragedy tonight
I get the twins
They get the best
I get a family.
I get a rest.
We get a few girls
I'll get some new girls
I get the thing I want to be
Free.
Free
Free, free, free, free
Nothing for kings
Nothing for crowns
Something for lovers, liars and clowns
What is the moral? Must be a moral
Here is the moral, wrong or right
Morals tomorrow
Comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy
Comedy tonight
(Man bellows) In the name of Preverti, daughter of the mountains whose embrace with Rani made the whole world tremble.
(All) Tremble!
(Man) Tremble.
Whose name is the Terrible.
Whose name is Baleful.
Whose name is Inaccessible.
Whose name is the Black Mother, mother of darkness.
(All) Kaili!
(Man) We turn our hearts to Kaili,
Drinker of blood, Black Mother.
(All) Kaili!
(Man) Killer of demons, gorge on this flesh, our offering.
- Drink...
- Halt!
- Halt?
- The ring.
She is not wearing the sacrificial ring.
She cannot be sacrificed without the ring.
Where is the ring?
What has she done with the ring?
(All) The ring! The ring!

- Oh, shocking.
- Monstrous.
- Ahme.
- The necessary preparations...
- The preparations for my departure...
- Are made.
- At once, without delay.
- The ring.
Over the water we must go.
- Bhuta.
- You ask of me, Master?
- Obedience and Love.
- This is so.
- Ahme.
- This is so.
- The ring.
- Has nobody looked on the washbasin?
I am making the immediate arrangements for my necessary...
- Are made.
- At once.
- Visit to England.
- In hand.
Something must be done.
Without the ring, there will be no sacrifice, without the sacrifice, no congregation.
Without a congregation... no more me.
This is so.
- Wave.
- I don't like to.
- Go on, wave.
- Shall I?
They expect it, don't they.
Lovely lads and so natural.
Adoration hasn't gone to their heads.
You know what I mean, success.
So natural and still the same as they was before they was.
- Someone's got hold of my finger.
- You trying to attract attention again?
She's pulling at it.
(Yells) Oh!
Ow!
She had my finger, you know...
Stop trying to drag things down to your own level.
I thought she was a sandwich until she went spare on my hand.
It's cold. It's a cold place.
- So, the ring?
- No. I could not get it off, Swami.
Oh dear!
Hey! Have you been messing with me in my kip?
I mean, with a fishing rod.
I wouldn't touch you with a plastic one.
What are you doing on the floor?
I'm tired.
- Hello?
- Hello?
Hey, Bea-atle!
How about this, Shufti?
Gold! All of it, pure gold.
In easy to handle denominational nuggets. Unmarked.
- Not a mark on them.
- No, I hate them.
- No.
- It makes your fingers go green.
It's not the Beatle with the ring.
- Aren't I?
- No, unfortunately.
Ah!
Hey, Bea-atle.
You shall have fun, eh?
No thanks, I'm rhythm guitar and mouth organ.
I didn't encourage that wink.
- It is not the one.
- My gosh.
They all look the same in their similitude and language.
Swami, it's raining on your...
After them.
- Quickly, quickly.
- Yes, yes.
- Right, right.
- All in.
- All in together now, sir.
- Now.
- Ah! Shilling!
- Shilling?
- Shilling.
- Oh, shilling!
- Now! Off!
- Off.
Oh... After them.
- What first attracted you to me?
- Well, you're very polite.
Ha, ha!
Hope he's in.
Ow!
- What are you doing?
- Posting a letter.
Ow!
Ow!
I am not what I seem.
Hey! My skin's soaked right through to the skin.
There's more here than meets the eye.
- Ho, ho!
- Ho!
- Ho, ho, ho!
- Oh!

You naughty boy.
(Whispers) Now for the ring!
Ow!
Oh! Oh, that stings.
(Yells) Kaili!
Kaili!
(Ahme) Flee!
Will you explain everything when the opportunity presents itself?
- Flee!
- OK.
Oh, goodness me!
Sex is creeping in.
Young people see it in the bazaars, market places, temple...
No wonder they turn up their noses at a mystical impulse...
We're taking up fox hunting so young people are involved in their sacrifices.
And will understand the deep significance of blood well shed.
Of course I don't expect you to see eye to eye with me...
What? Who? Where?
Now... If you'll pardon me.
It's played out, any road?
You know, rings...
- Very nice.
- It's yours.
Nah! My missus wouldn't wear a ring like that. Ostentatious, that is!
- He's from the west.
- Nah, east. Stepney.
- Does this ring mean anything to you?
- Freemason?
- You're all English!
- That's what unions are for.
I tell a lie. We have got one in there from the mystic east... Or we did have.
(Hollers) Hey, Abdul!
- Yes.
- We did have one, didn't we?
That lad from the sunnier climate, east of Suez?
Very nice he was, too.
I think he's still down there, in the coal hole.
Doesn't the blood rush to your head, sir?
Doesn't the eastern flavour come expensive?
Doesn't the blood rush to your stomach?
Is this ring nasty, sir?
Argh! Kaili! Oh dear, I must lie down.
Oh! That's better.
Excuse me... This menu...
I've just seen the most amazing thing...
(Gasps) Oh...
Hey, did you...
There's a man down there on his head.
Arthur?
Could you pick this up for me, please?
Are you eating, too, Paul?
Your friend is in mortal danger.
I can say no more.
It's rather a jolly place.
- Soup, please.
- Soup, yeah.
He has three hours to live.
- Say no more.
- I can say no more.
I ordered soup too.
- Soup!
- Soup.
Pardon me, sir. That's a very fascinating ring you've got there.
- Unless I'm mistaken.
- Is it?
The dreaded sacred sacrificial ring of the dread Kaili.
- Say no more.
- I can say no more.
Excuse me. If he is to be sacrificed before Kaili, why is he not painted red?
I've never had the courage to ask him, but as he's my best friend I will.
- What's this? Glasses?
- That's right, sir. Glasses.
A victim is offered to the dread Kaili everyday.
All are happy to go.
He who wins is privileged to wear the sacred ring from sun to moon, from moon to sun.
And at the end of the happy day he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.
And sacrificed jolly with a knife, so I'm told, with that ring.
Three hours to live.
- (Man) You have till five o'clock.
- Before a new victim is chosen.
You are lucky to be chosen!
My old mum would give her right hand to be chosen.
- What's this?
- A season ticket.
I like a lot of seasoning in my soup.
There's somebody been in this soup.
I got it from this Eastern bird... lady... in a fan letter.
I get all sorts.
Rubbish, though, isn't it? Sacrifice.
No? Come off!
So, get in touch with your authorities and send back the ring to this lady, who will then go happy to Kaili.
- Thank you.
- (Bhuta) Three hours.
There's a footprint in here.
Here, you have a go.
(Gasps) Flee!
We have lots of little problems like this.
Some of them matrimonial.
This ring is not stone.
- I've only got three hours to live.
- Therefore, it must be a metal.
- I don't know this metal.
- You're not getting anywhere, are you?
Early days yet, sir.
Therefore it must be an alloy.
There's a certain amount of hurry up involved here. My life is in danger.
Three ten.
- The wheel.
- Not the wheel.
Even the Royal House of Hanover had the wheel, sir.
- I've never seen anything like it.
- You've failed.
- I suggest you see a specialist.
- What kind? Your tools are broken.
The fire brigade once got my head out of some railings.
- Did you want them to?
- No. I left it there when not at school.
You can see a lot of the world from railings.
I like operations, they give you a sense of outlook.
This won't work.
It could work if the government would spend more money.
Made in America you see.
Another failure.
The idea is...
The idea as I see it is that we expand the molecules and the ring grows bigger and drops off.
- What's your electricity bill like?
- It's sort of a long counterfoil.
It's not dropping off.
Voltage! Voltage... up, up...
Up, up!
- Are you sure I'm earthed?
- Oh no, hold on. Thank you.
Made in America.
Streets ahead of anything we've got.
This is English.
- Is it green, the earth in America?
- In some places it's brown.
He's not earthed.
He's an idiot.
Has a degree in woodwork. I ask you!
Done.
- Come on.
3-2-1-go! I observe the procedure.
He'll thank me for it in the end.
Scientist, you're getting nowhere.
It's the plugs.
Good British plugs.
All this America rig. Wrong voltage.
That's what foxes me.
- How do you feel?
- I used to use my hands.
He used to use his hands.
- Will he still be able to drum?
- Did he do a lot of it?
- Voltage... up!
- I'm no mean hand at the old sticks.
The voltage, up, up, up!
- Hey, he's calling you. Up, up, up!
- Up, up, up!
The bunker!
- I can't watch.
- It's working! Give it the gun, Algernon.
Stop it!
It's more than my job's worth!
He's out to rule the world if he can get a government grant.
Outrageous!
You're nothing but a mad scientist!
Fantastic!
With a ring like that I could, dare I say it, rule the world.
I must have the ring...
Algernon, the laser.
Get your hands off him or I'll call the Metropolitan scuffers!
The laser...
- Get him off.
- I must have this ring. The laser.
Halt! Release him or I'll shoot and I am a dead eyeshot shooting.
- I've got it.
- Switch off that machine.
- The laser.
- The laser, yes...
I'm better with animals than plugs and transistors.
MIT was after me, wanted me to rule the world for them.
Daddy being the local master of the hounds.
That's where I get it from, my love of animals.
They trust me.
I should have been in vivisection.
How do you know we can trust her?
She's had your fingers before, Ringo.
Well, that was a mistake.
I can vouch for her. We're very close.
- Lasers ready.
- Get them!
It's the wrong plug...
Just give me five minutes.
It's the brain drain.
His brain's draining.

Now see what you've done with your filthy Eastern ways.
No! It is Clang, the High Priest, who is filthy in his ways.
(Posh accent) How do we know you're not sent by him to nick the ring, when you've lulled us with your filthy ways?
- What filthy ways are these?
- You can put that away.
Until this moment you were safe because my sister was chosen and no other could be sacrificed to Kaili.
Now my sister is safe and rises up.
(Ahme) 'And a new day dawns, a new victim is chosen... '
From this moment it is death to him who wears the ring.
This will make your finger shrink.
Be brave.
Don't look.
Alas, if he were brave this would not be necessary.
Where've you been?
You've been up that temple again.
You're as bad as your sister, coming home from work at all hours and colours.
There might be some insurance.
I wouldn't think of such a thing!
Find out.
What did you say that stuff is?
This will just make his finger shrink a little. It's a minor medical secret.
I'm sure there's no call for all this.
I'm allergic to Penicillin and all them other wonder drugs.
- Gum?
- Are you sure it's not or habit forming?
No. As long as you don't swallow it.
(Whispers) All right.
Synchronise your watches.
You, you, you and you.
Paint him red and then kill him.
Kaili.
Kaili. Kaili.
I promise you the effect is purely transitory.
It wears off very quickly.
(Ahme) Don't answer it! It's Clang.
- Perhaps it won't take...
- This is a dreadful miscarriage.
(Ringo) Come on, my finger!
Where's Paul?
Where's Paul? Come on, Paul, stop messing about.
Where's he gone?
- Where are you, Paul?
- It's his best suit.
Don't look right or left. They might take us for innocent bystanders.
- Standby.

Look out!
They're coming through the door!

Neb! And it's yours.
- Keep your hands up.
- How can I get it off with my hands up?
In the name of science
I demand that ring.
It's yours!
- It's worth something.
- A couple of bob, at least.
Had to do all this myself... Backward
Britain they call us on Wall Street.
With a ring like that could I interest the military?
No, I could not.
I can't get it off.
- Paul?
- Look, what you've done.
- Hey, is that Paul?
- Algernon, my little black bag.
I shall have to operate.
It'll be on the National Health, won't it?

Ugh! I'm all sticky. You're all red!

I'm glad it wore off quickly.

Run!
Quick! Faster!
Hey, mind the tank!
Get up, Johnny!
- Stop!
- Johnny! Walk for me. You can do it!
In here! Quickly! Quick!
- Fire!
- (Yells) Fire!
Fire!
- Left! Steady on. 1-500.
I regret losing a lieutenant as able as Ahme but she was told the price of capture.
- Enemy tank moving from left to right.
- Loaded.
- Well, fire the nasty thing.
- Firing now, Saheb.
Missed! You naughty boys.
Turn us right.
Fire!
There must be somewhere in England where one can find sanctuary to think.
How's your equilibrium, Ringo?
How's yours?
You're light again, George.
- How do you know it's not you.
- Cos I never am, am I Paul?
Here, cop this, one hand!
- (John) Ugly, though.
- The hands?
- Some people's are.
- Show us your hand, Ringo.
- You want to chuck one in?
- Get on!
- How about drumming, though?
- It won't affect it.
I don't know many...
It appears I need one card.
I'm chucking one in.
Very light-hearted.
- Discarding it.
- Like an old boot.
They're talking about your finger, you know.
One card. Dealer takes one.
See, that didn't hurt.
- Will you hold this drumstick?
- Manchester has a good drummer.
Well, I don't just drum with it, do I?
- What else then?
- I use it, you know.
Quite a good-looking fellow, too.
I'll raise you.
You haven't used that finger in the past hour and we're in danger.
Me and Paul haven't seen you use of that finger, have we?
- No.
- And again.
We're risking our lives to preserve a useless member.
That bloke with Scott,
I've always admired the way he went into the snow for his mates.
- And again.
- You're joking!
Just hold this drumstick.
You've raised it a little bundle on the quiet.
- It's like having a tooth out.
- I've got a good hand.
You only lay out money is when you've got five aces.
- Do you want to see me?
- You're joking... take it.
I will see... I've won it.
- Cut.
- No!
I think tea, don't you? Tea.
They expect me to cut my finger off.
The famous finger, eh?
So the police are extended giving the famous protection, for which we are justly proud in this country, for a finger, eh?
What's that... It's haunted, you know.
- Are you going to cut?
- No, I'm not and let that be an end to it.
End to it!
This wing of the palace is haunted.
We won't leave this palace alive.
The Queen will have something to say about that.
- What's that?
- I beg your pardon?
- That thing coming through his stomach.
- I daren't look!
It's only a hose.
- It's for you.
- It's the gardener.
I'll stick it out the window.
(Man) Eyes left.
(Man) Eyes front!
Must be their tea break.
Hands up!
Hands up! Quick!
Come on, lets have you.
Steady!
There goes my knighthood.
You, left hand...
Lets have that ring.
It's me, you fool.
- Quick! Quick!
- Let's catch him!
This should work, it's from Harvard.
- It looks like a laser.
- It's a relativity cadenza.
That should slow them down a bit.
There, point it down the hall.
Quickly!
Hurry up with the plug,
I'll align the sights... Yes!
Right, good.
I think it is a laser.
Oh!
(Sighs) Oh...
A royal fuse has just blown.
- It is a rela... teva... camenza...
- Bad machine!
Hair dryer, I'll bet she had one for Christmas.
We are going for a friendly walk with the police down by the river.
Ooh, look at that.
- It's a band.
- (♪ Bagpipe music plays)
Paint! Paint!
(Yells) Come on, quickly!
Get them, men. I'm with you.
After them! After them! Quick!
Look.
Oh, lovely pub.
Two lagers and lime and two lagers and lime, please.
- Looks like it's me again.
- Everything's relative, you know.
- Well, you didn't miss your tonsils.
- How do you know?
Why don't you chop it off, Ringo?
Look John, I've had some great times with this finger.
How do you know I wouldn't miss it?
You're a rat underneath.
You can have a fire and theft policy.
Five quid a week.
It's because you're a Beatle that your fingers wasn't on it.
- Is there a cure for nail biting?
- (Paul) Oh, yes.
Oh, yes!
I'm always getting winked at these days.
It used to be you, Paul.
Oh, Sorry Ringo.
Peep boo!
All the rungs have been neatly sawn in the middle.
Ah, the window!
- Your famous Ringo is safe.
- No, he isn't.
What? Cover all exits.
Sharp lookout.
- Don't move.
- You heard what she said.
Do you know Beethoven's
9th symphony?
It goes like this...
- What?
- This trap door.
Oh, here you are...
Permit me.
It's Raja, the famous Bengal man-eater who escaped from the zoo this morning.
- So it is!
- Don't worry, he's harmless.
All you have to do is sing Beethoven's
Ode to Joy from the 9th symphony.
- Why didn't you think of that?
- Raja was reared on the classics.
(John) Don't worry, just whistle famous
Beethoven's famous 9th symphony.
Come on! Come on!
Beep, beep!
Psst!
- (Ringo) Who let it out?
- Nobody will know.
We're not going there.
- We just put it round we're going there.
- We're not going there.
- We just put it round.
- So everyone thinks we're going there?
- I'd like to go there.
- You wouldn't like it.
- Where are we going?
- Never you mind.
- You're welcome.
- Goodbye, sir.
Him!
- Welcome to Nassau.
- Thank you very much.
I'd like to present PC 17...
- PC 6...
- Very smart.
- PC 47...
- Uh-huh.
- PC 6 of 3...
- Oh.
- PC 9...
- Hmm.
- PC 85...
- Mmm.
- PC 4...
- Yes.
PC 21, PC 85...
You should have thought of that before you left the house.
Left... To shore...

- Let's play a game, eh? Beep-beeps.
- OK.
Beep-beep, beep-beep!
Oh, oh, oh!
Radar's broken! Never mind.
(Hollers) Beatles! Hello!
Port... Starboard... Over there!
Oh, oh, oh!
Ah! A-ha, a-ha, a-ha!
Open that rock!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Is that it?
- Better watch your fingers, Ringo!
Clang had the whole temple transported here for your sacrifice.
He needn't have bothered.
Very nice of him, though.
- What's this?
- This is where you'll be disembowelled.
You don't go for all that, do you?
Keeps you busy, eh?
- Do you know where Clang is?
- I'm his mother and he's a good boy.
I don't want to knock anyone's religion, but...
- In here, quick.
- (Ringo) I can't swim.
I'm not going!
Where have they gone?
- Let's go back and get them!
- I'm game.
- Let's smash them!
- Let's find that temple.
- A man's got to do what he's got to do.
- I don't like running away.
- Let's go back and get them.
- They'll disembowel us.
- Not if I get the boot in first.
- Let's go back and get them.
They won't disembowel us, you see.
That's all gab - disembowelling...
- Signpost.
- Signpost.
- Guide book.
- Guide book.
- Feet.
- Feet? Oh, feet!
Red light.
Kaili!
- Green light, go!
- (Yells) Kaili!
The things we have to do in these heathen countries.
There must be an easier way to set a trap!
- Easterner speaks with forked tongue.
- What does he say?
Passing this way with hot foot to the temple.
Don't encourage him!
You've got the part, Paul.
- Dare we ask how you know?
- How! I saw those footprints...
And this guidebook.
- To the temple.
- (Whistles)
After them... slowly!
- That's not it, is it?
- It's on the map as being here.
That temple under the rock, that swimming pool that we came up in...
- I'm lost!
- This isn't a temple, is it?
- So this is a famous temple?
- Should be. It's gone.
I hope that disembowelling thingy has gone, too.
- Was there ever a temple here?
- Never, sir.
Old army place. Well-known place of retreat for courting couples who like the echoes of bugles as they court.
That's my theory.
Ugh!
- Aren't we going in?
- No, let's not.
Oh, come on lads, where's that famous pluck?
- I haven't got any. Have you, George?
- Did have.
- I have had.
- I will have.
He's a bit soft that Inspector, isn't he?
He never takes his hat off.
It's very hot over here for wearing a hat.
- I'm off.
- Typical!
(Yells) Kaili!
Argh!
- Kaili!
- Kaili!
The fiends! They've electrified the wire with high tension. HT.
The fiends!
(Hollers) Help me!
Help!
He's mine!
Help!
Help me!
There's one on the back, but it's not the right one.
Come here, boy! Let me explain.
This is no time for foolish tricks!
This is a hired car.
Back up and smash him off.
(Algernon) Now, this will get him!
Oh! Never mind. Try again.
This should give him a headache.
Where's he gone?
- That's done it, he's gone.
- I can't start the car.
- (Engine splutters)
- Hello.
Oh, hello! Hang on a minute...
On, on!
I seem to be having a slight difficulty.
To the right! Oh...
- I think it might be the wrong key.
- On!
On!
(Algernon) Got it.
Didn't take long, did it?
Thanks for the lift, sailor!
- Where did the thugs go?
- They've vanished.
- He's got a plan.
- A very famous plan.
Superintendent, you've got a plan.
- Yes...
- Superintendent.
I've got a plan.
(Hollers) Ringo!
Ringo!
- Ringo!
- Ringo!
Ringo!
Ringo!
All right, talk!
We know he's a prisoner, but where?
- I'm a perfect surgeon.
- Huh?
- I'm a perfect surgeon.
- He was asked to take it up.
Alas... Scalpel.
Sca...
Sand in the generator.
It gets everywhere. No wonder
I never get anything done.
Fix it, Algernon.
You wouldn't want me to go in with a blunt scalpel.
Fix it!
I'm a decent employer, but he takes advantage of me.
- It's the heat, it makes him stroppy.
- Luckily.
I've got some juice.
(Ringo) I can't understand it. They kept pulling my nose. Mine of all noses!
- What's that?
- Distilled from the essence of orchids.
Hands up!
- What's that?
- Distilled from the essence...
Not distilled from the essence of orchids found only in certain recesses?
At last! I'll have my just reward.
Give it to me! Sir Tiberius Foot Juice!
- But the ring...
- Who needs it now that I have this.
- Do you know what this is?
- A Webley automatic...
It's Nobel Prize juice. Set sail for home, for England! A jewel set in the sea!
The government in the palm of my hand.
What's it say?
- You're going on a sea voyage...
- No, this!
- (Algernon) I don't know.
- Haven't you a degree in Eastern?
- (Algernon) I don't think so.
- Let's get it translated.
- Now!
- Right!
- I can't swim.
- What do you mean you can't swim?
(Clang) Treacherous Woman, tremble...
In the name of Preverti, daughter of the mountains, whose embrace with Rani made the whole world tremble.
- Wait till my mates get you.
- I don't think so...
We've had two battalions flown in specially to ambush your friends.
They're quite merciless.
One word of warning from you and you die instantly.
Oh, mother Kaili, whose name is the Terrible...
I'm going to miss the sacrifice.
(Clang)... whose name is the Inaccessible, whose name is the Black Mother, mother of darkness!
We turn our hearts to...
(Ringo) No!
(Clang)... drinker of blood...
- It's off! I'm saved!
- Killer of demons, drink of this vessel, gorge on this blood, our offering...
Get sacrificed!
I don't subscribe to your religion!
- There he is!
- It just came off!
(Yells) Quickly! After them!
I'm going to miss the sacrifice.
- It came off! I just showed courage.
- How many fingers you got left?
- You're all red again.
- I'm beginning to like it.
Ah... So! Ha!

INTIMATE LIGHTING
Forte. Now. That's it
More beat. Tempo
What are you doing with those double basses, for Christ's sake?
- You won't know what hit you, Honza
- I think I played it correctly
The timing, in general, will be determined by the soloist himself
We can play it more slowly, or more quickly. I don't know
We'll probably have a rehearsal with him before the concert
So the composition's general rhythm will be determined then and there
But now, gentlemen, please, you must play it the way I tell you to
Keep the beat that I show you.
I hope that's clear to all of you
Yeah
Gentlemen, this is serious.
The concert is in a few days
This is no variety show, this is a serious concert
Together with the soldiers there will be 65 of us
This means that during the rehearsal you'll have to sit...
...where I've told you to sit now.
No excuses
Otherwise it will be a madhouse.
There will be soldiers
And half of us are not even here now.
I want it to be perfect
- We've already sold 180 tickets
You see, gentlemen. 240 tickets
In other words, we'll sell at least 60 more...
...and remember the last concert we had...
...when we did the Jirovec thing,
80% of the seats were sold
I spoke with Dr Simacek and he said that he'd take one too
So, gentlemen, the grandioso
Before I forget, how will it work out for the rehearsal before the concert?
Will there be enough time for the soloist?
I don't know, I asked him to come a day earlier
Let's hope so.
That's fine then. All right, let's start
We'll deal with you afterwards
Bambas, that's nice
Well, the terrace...
That's just it
Well, that's what I'm trying to say - the terrace...
- It must be nice to eat there
- True
- Do you want some gooseberries?
- Yeah, I'd like some
- Can't you wait a bit!
- It doesn't matter
There must be another one here
Don't bother looking for it
- Daddy, Daddy
- Come here, my boy
So Mary, what do you say?
Daddy, Kaja did a wee in the bath tub
Really? You mustn't do that Kaja, bad boy
- Say hello to Uncle
- How do you do?
Hiya
Tell him your name
What's wrong now?
You're a big girl now, aren't you?
Which school do you go to?
You're a bad boy, go now
I don't know what's wrong with him today
Bambas, tell me, how many kids do you have?
Look, Petr. Don't call me Bambas.
Marus doesn't know about that
She bit you? We'll eat everything and we won't leave anything for her
That'll be really good too
Kaja will have some,
Daddy will have some and Auntie too
Well, Uncle will eat too
Hello, there. Come on in
Show Mummy where that beast bit you.
Show her!
Here, wasn't it? What a beast
Kaja, sit down here.
Stay put for a while
Please help yourself, eat
- Have some, Miss
- No, thanks. I'll just have some tea
- Petr!
- I still have some...
What do you put on?
Well, what we perform are classics.
After all, we're not in Prague, old chap
Well, since Kaja is principal of that school, it's not bad now
He doesn't have to do so much with the kids
But the old man, he does
He comes home at times raving mad.
Doesn't he, Kaja?
They don't show anything else in Prague either
Yes, they do. Take the philharmonic orchestra. They go abroad too
Peek-a-boo
- Well, that's the philharmonic orchestra
- Yeah
All we do is tour the countryside with Strauss waltzes, you see
We've also been furious many times whilst building the house
You know how that gets on your nerves and...
You too are furious at times?
No. Bambas being furious?
I can't believe it
Oh, you mean Kaja? Well...
Peek-a-boo
I've discovered a new Jirovec now
So, we performed him...
People from the radio came down from Budejovice to record it
You wouldn't believe it but it sounded all right
You see, some of it's been suppressed, some of it pulled out...
Kaja, behave yourself.
Come here like a good boy
Leave him.
We're playing nicely, aren't we?
He must learn to behave himself
- How long were you building the house?
- Almost seven years
- What are you doing?
- Just to see how strong you are
You can carry two blocks. Sure you can
- Heavy, isn't it?
- Yeah, sure
- You're groaning...
- I'm not...
- Do you want some more?
- Sure
Missed! Bitch, bitch
Marus, what is this?
Leave him alone, Kaja
- That's enough
- You know that suits you well
Take it off
- Stop that, you're crazy. Take it off
- Wait a bit
For Christ's sake, not like this.
You are clumsy
- What? Wait...
- Bambas
Bambas, come here. I'll drop it
Wait, wait, don't drop it. Don't you dare
- Leave them alone
- Such nice bricks too
Look, one shot for eight bricks
And look how many there are. Man...
That means lots of drunks
Yeah... drunks
But when we were building it, our tongues used to get dry
Something like five shots per drunkard
Sure, but doubles
Well, that would be...
...five times... divided by five
That makes it over 800 drunks
What? Over 80?
One wouldn't believe it.
We must all be nuts
Measuring everything in bricks...
- Kaja!
- What?
I've invited, Mister...
Me
...to the funeral
But he isn't interested in a funeral, Dad
Interested or not, in a way that's music too
- I didn't say anything
- And good music too. You'll see
Once we get started, everybody starts crying, even the relatives
And then the main thing - one funeral, 200 bricks
Grandma
Grandma
- What do you want?
- What is that hen doing here?
- Is she here again?
- There, you see
She's looking for somewhere to hatch
Go away... Damn it, how often have I told you not to put it there?
Yeah, yeah...
Kaja, leave her alone, you'll hurt her.
Here, here...
- Nothing but hens around
- Here, here
Wherever you turn, you step on something
So what? That's no skin off your back
Yeah, but look at that car. It looks more like a hen house than a garage here
After all, this is not only your car.
Dad and I contributed 20,000
Yeah, I've heard that a number of times
Well, I have to keep reminding you.
You'll forget very quickly
What about me? I've worked like a slave. I almost ruined my hands
Well, you've got a house, haven't you?
Yeah, a house. I'm telling you, that hen was here for the last time
Just you leave her alone.
You know one egg and the next
Here, come here
Move over a bit, you're in the way
- Yeah
- She's afraid of you
Here, little one, come here
Dad, there's a hen under the car
Where is that monster?
There you see what she's doing?
I'll show them...
Here, here
- Wait, don't you start that car
- Kaja, get away from here
For Christ's sake, Kaja.
What are you trying to do?
They'll stop laying eggs
You see, people enjoy different things everywhere
But sorrow is always the same
You know that saying
One sad song is enough to go round the world
People prefer to have a good cry than a good laugh
And with this... if it were to run on tears that would be something
I'll go and have a look
Sure, but don't cry your eyes out
Such pretty eyes
That would be a pity
Those shock absorbers aren't working properly
- Karlik, isn't he sensitive?
- Who, me? Why?
I really need a woman right now
Well, why don't you?
Yeah, can I?
The way I look at yours, when she goes so nicely...
...that's really something
Cute, isn't she?
Cute? A jewel
If I could add a bit here and there...
- Look, what it's doing to me
- Yeah, I can see
Did you read about that Dutch paratrooper...
...who dropped from a height of 3,000 metres without a parachute...
...and fell into some cotton?
Nothing happened to him
3,000 metres?
That's strange
Well, if he fell into cotton, it's possible
I've jumped once from at least three times this height
Something like from the first floor, but no cotton on the ground, just concrete
That was quite a bang, when I fell... I mean, jumped
- My feet were all bloody
- What kind of shoes did you have?
The shoes were all right, but I was holding them in my hands
I wore them the time when
I walked from Budejovice to Vienna
I came back by train
When I came home, father said,
"Did you buy new shoes?"
"No, those are the old ones", I said
My time has come
The grave is waiting
Take me to rest
My loved ones
Wipe your tears
For proceeding to where we all shall meet again
Christ our Saviour have mercy on us
On my soul
Goodbye, friends
The end has come
Yeah, Smetana!
Dear old man, but he heard...
Once I had a girl in a cornfield
She cried, yes, she cried too
Except that this is no corn
So what?
- Dad, let's...
- Yeah, let's go
Petricek...
- It's not Petricek at all
- So what is it?
For the last time, if you can't guess, you don't love me at all
Well...
There, you see.
I love you
Well, that's exactly the same as before
All wrong, look - I... Iove... you
That's not it at all, it's...
I love you
Come here, that's wrong again.
Look here
With the music.
I love you
- You're showing off again.
- I am not, but...
But that's not it...
Well, all right. I'll tell you something
Look, I'll hum it for you. Listen
See if you guess...
No... Iook
There...
Little fish with your silent face
Heard that you have magic charms
And know what torments my heart
You know where my loved one is...
We'll have to go.
They're tooting like mad
That's what I tell you all the time
What?
A golden ring she gave me
And I gave her a rose
As proof of my love for her
I gave her a rose as proof of my love
It didn't take long
And he went away into the world
And the lovely young girl
Left this world too
And the lovely young girl
Left this world too...
And what about the people, did they cry?
- Sure, all of them
- Did you enjoy it?
Let's go, I'm hungry
- You've been drinking, haven't you?
- Well, they wouldn't let me go
Sure, our men are so popular
Not long ago they came, to get them from...
Kaja... where did they come from?
- I don't remember...
- Those that got the cement for us
I got the cement in the end
Yeah, but where did you get it from, from Vejtora?
Remember, when we played there
That doesn't make any difference
But I'm telling you, he had tears in his eyes, the old Smetacek
Am I arguing?
Big tears he shed...
Well, it doesn't make any difference
Sure... but Standa Machacek, he cried like a kid
We couldn't calm him down at all
All right, so they all cried
Sure, they cried.
And remember Vanicek for instance
He couldn't even talk, that's how he cried
You wouldn't have got those titles otherwise
And the leg for the young lady
- You like chicken legs don't you?
- I want a leg too
You shouldn't talk while eating.
We've got guests
Kaja. Grandfather didn't get the leg either and doesn't mind, isn't that so?
Please, stay. He doesn't have to have everything he sees
But he likes it. Here, have the leg, and...
Kaja, what are you doing?
Put it back immediately
Let him have both of them, we'll share this with Petr
Sure
No, you can't do that.
You won't have enough. Take mine
Leave that, leave it
Here, take mine
No, then you won't have any, we'll share ours
How do you want to split a leg?
- We'll manage...
- Look, this can be divided nicely
You take the leg then
There, and that's it.
So much talk about nothing...
- Let go
- That's enough
- Funny, isn't it?
- That's enough. Off you go to sleep
- And both of you. Now
- Don't shout at them, he'll get sick
Come, Karlik, we'll go together, come along
No, not you, stay
Little one...
She's worse than the little one
There you see, he's back, and with the beer
How do you do?
I'm the pharmacist
- Excuse me, please
- I'm retired now
Oh, our pharmacist
You're having fun here
We haven't finished eating
Come and sit down here and stay put
Go on in, the men will be glad to see you
I have brought, as usual some...
You shouldn't have...
Oh, you're welcome. It's nothing
That's our pharmacist
It's nothing
Miss, your food is getting cold
Excuse me,
I don't know what happened to me
No worries, there's always fun here
They've got to get away
You're just picking at it
We'll go and wash them
- What about you, Kaja?
- You'll come too
It's almost like being in a bar here
How come?
Just like in a bar
Accentuate
More stress
Piano
Dad, a little less volume
- Now... out...
- Out, sure I can go out
All together
Forte
And now piano
Piano
And now with a bang
It's her tonsils
All this talking
We can't carry on like this, gentlemen
I played it accurately
Dad
I can't do much better with joints like this
You always blame everything on your bad joints
Even a woodcutter can play that
A woodcutter maybe, I've worked harder than a woodcutter
You can tell by listening to you playing
- Why aren't you playing?
- It's no use
Don't be silly, Bambas.
After all we just want to play
- Well, either we play or argue
- Sure, you're right
Miss... Miss
Come and have a look at this pre-war wire gauze
I'd have done it myself
Why should you? You wouldn't believe it, but I'm a modern woman
But it's...
You may not know it, but I'll tell you something
The old man kidnapped me
We'd only known each other for three days
You see, they came with a circus
My family had the police after me.
But I was in France by then
You know, today it sounds funny, but my poor mother
Here, try it
Don't be shy, go right ahead
I'm not much good at it any more
Your knees have to be kept tight, and your back bent nicely
Mirna Ray was wonderful at it.
Only she did it on a horse
You see, we were friends
I'd love to ride a horse some day, but only ride one
Oh, well, I was quite different then, in everything
But you're still quite...
Yeah, before we started building the house I still did my exercises every day
But now I'm afraid my back hurts
I'd set the alarm clock, lie down and count to 40
One...
...two...
...three...
Legs not too high. Not too low.
Where it hurts most
It's an excellent way to keep your tummy trim
I've told Marus a number of times, but no
She takes after her dad
A woman, imagine, and she likes beer
Excuse me, Gentlemen, my little finger feels numb
I don't know why. Look at it, colleague
- May I call you colleague?
- Sure. Go ahead
You can see it a bit
It probably needs a bit of exercise
Let's try it again, Gentlemen
You know, at my age the joints and those fingers...
...don't cooperate so well any more.
That's age isn't it?
Let's start, maybe it will get better when I play
Let's do the second repeat
That's before those bars, isn't it?
Piano!
Forte now
Dad, C sharp
Where?
Instead of the C you played
I see
But, Gentlemen,
I like this movement so well
If I'd have gone to the conservatory...
Petr
Petr, do you see?
Petr, don't you see?
- I see
- What?
I see
Pretty, isn't she?
Petr! Black one
- We see her
- Leave us alone
Gentlemen, she's still young
Well, when I came here, she laughed so much
Well, what could I do,
I had to laugh too
Well, let's go from A now
I want to hear the first and second violin
I thought you wanted something
We do - stop bothering us
Hello, Vera
I'm not Vera, I'm Stepa
You're Pepa, aren't you?
I like you, I like you Vera
I'm Stepa, see
Stepa
- St... Stepa
- Ste...
- St...
- Stepa
That's right. What's your name?
Je... Jerous...
- Nice name
- Nice name, isn't it?
- Do you like it?
- Well
Come for a walk with me
Where would you like to go?
- I like you, I really like you, Stepa
- But I'm ugly...
I really like you. You're a pretty girl
I've never seen such a pretty girl before in my life
You're only saying that so I'll go for a walk with you
A bit more. That's fine, good
Try some more
There, you see. That's good
A bit more up here, Marus
Here?
The shoulders. That's all right
Seven
Eight, nine...
...ten, enough
Well, I'll be going
One more kiss here
Don't go
But Stepa, I haven't even had a good chat with Bambas yet
Tomorrow is another day
Well, all right, but tomorrow is the concert
Now we've got time for it and... well...
Well, wait for 20
All right. Come here
- No. No
So we'll divorce because of some eggnog
Wait
- No, I won't
- Wait a bit
They're doing exercises in there
After all they are young
Sleep, my baby
You're a good little baby
There, there
What's wrong? What have I done now?
Bambas is more important to you than I am
- How come?
- You were in such a hurry to join him
You didn't care what I was doing
Oh, that's it.
Well, I was in a hurry
But just because I was in a hurry
No. You just go to him.
I don't care any more
But Stepa!
All right, I'll go
Really, I'll go
Bambas
- Why aren't you sleeping?
- But...
Would you like some too?
Well... Iooking at you,
I wouldn't mind some
But there's no more smoked meat
We'll get the beers, there
- And this is always full in the autumn
- What a life
But what will I give you?
How about this?
Marus is not much of an intellectual, but... here, smell this...
Homemade
Is this homemade too?
Sure
Oh... this is it, that's what I like
Everywhere is quiet...
...and I sit here, listen and stuff myself
That's it
Well, pour some more
And that too.
But this music...
Well, that music...
Take Jirovec, for example
It's old and simple, but it's effective
Yeah... Jirovec is effective
Bambas, when did you start fishing?
The fishes?
Well, you could never understand
I know everything around here in this house
I even know when the old man goes to the toilet
Or when Granny gets pains in her back
Just like today
But by the water...
...that's an adventure, Petr dear
You never know what comes next
Look, as I walked down the stairs
I heard the old man
I'm telling you, I've never heard anything like it in my life
Oh, Dad, he's got an amazing snore
And how he shoots
Look, this is where mine will be someday
And now listen to the concert
I know this
That's devilish
But it gets me when...
That was quite a pause
We can never match that
Look, Bambas, did you ever hear a beautiful woman snore?
But a really beautiful one
That's good
But have you ever heard my woman?
How she snores?
Kaja, Kaja
All right, if that's what you want
- Petr...
- Well...
Everything OK?
- Petr
- So?
- Don't be silly
- What are you doing?
Don't be silly
Wait. You've got to go at it from the front
But I want to go back there
You've got to go in the front and then you'll get in the back
We are smashed
Don't talk so much
Have you got a house?
You don't
Have you got a car?
You don't
Are you married?
No, you aren't
So nothing is lost
Look, Petr, nothing is lost
... and I'll give you a rose...
Stop those silly jokes
What's come over you, Bambas?
To me you'll always be an artist
Pause
What's that?
Jirovec
And on to Bethlehem we shall go...
Let me see
Look
The viola. That's my favourite
- Wait
- Don't worry
You'll take it from me
Listen. Yeah
That's nothing like...
...but...
Professor Klabik
Listen
We'll take our instruments and...
Into the world
We'll play at funerals
No, concerts... just like before
Dreamer, concerts.
Nobody wants to listen to concerts
No more concerts.
It's funerals for me...
Don't be foolish, Bambas, that's money
One funeral - 200 bricks
Well, we can settle that en route
Now we'll set fire to it, and...
- Granny, she's kicking me
- I'll be there in a moment
It's a bit thick, but good
I like eggnog
Awful, that's what it is
Why aren't you eating, Marus?
How can I with that tooth?
You could have had it taken out long ago
You'd better shut up
- That's our smart guy
- How come?
He'll be ringing the noon bell someday
- He rings well, but a bit late
- Always?
Sometimes an hour, sometimes two, depends on the weather
I've had it for 25 years
When I forget to wind it at night,
I can't go to sleep, I'm so used to it
She can't be interested in that old alarm clock
I'm not talking about the clock but about the force of habit
To what shall we drink?
To our health
To the concert...
...pretty women...
- Well, what else?
- What's the difference?
That's something I didn't drink to before
All right then
We'll be standing here like this until judgment day
A bit of patience, that's what we need
Oh, those Sundays...
(BOTH IMITATING
CAR ENGINE)
Hang on, we're coming to a bend.
You're going too fast!
No, I'm not. Hang on!
What's this heap of old iron doing here?
Old iron?
I'll give you
10 bob for it.
Don't be daft.
This was once a great car.
Won the Grand Prix three years running.
So it's a car, is it?
Certainly it's a car.
It's a racing car.
And we're winning.
And you're in the way.
And you're in the way for a right belt around the ear, young man, if I have any more of your lip.
All right.
I'll give you
15 bob for it.
Make it 30 bob, and she's yours.
Mr. Coggins, you're not going to sell her, are you?
Of course he's gonna sell her.
What do you think he's running here, a children's playground or something?
All right, 30 bob.
I'll pick her up Wednesday.
But, Mr. Coggins, you promised we could play in her.
Well, I'm sorry, my dears, but she ain't any use to me.
Times are hard.
But you can't take her away.
She's not just any old car.
She's ours.
Not anymore, she ain't.
I'll see you tomorrow, Bill.
Giddy-up!
What're you going to do with her?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do with her, we're gonna put her in the clapper and we're gonna crunch her up till she's one solid piece of metal.
Then we're gonna put her in a fiery furnace, and we're gonna melt her down till she's liquid iron.
That's what we're gonna do with her.
Now look what you've done.
You've frightened her.
She shivered.
See? She's a very special car.
If you put her in the fiery furnace, you'll be guilty of murder.
Yeah, and if you don't get out of it,
I'll be guilty of two more murders.
Now go on, out of it.
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!
Please, Mr. Coggins, you can't sell our lovely car to that nasty man.
Well, I'm sorry, children, but I'm afraid
I already have.
I know!
Daddy will buy it for us.
Won't he, Jemima?
Of course he will.
Mr. Coggins, promise you won't let her go until we come back.
Well, 30 shillings, mind.
Not a penny less.
Please promise.
Please.
All right, I promise.
Come on, Jemima.
Well, that's a clever thing to do!
We're very sorry, miss.
I'm sure you are.
Well, just look at my car.
And just look what a mess I'm in, too.
Oh, no, I think you're beautiful.
And I like your car.
Hmm.
Just the same, you shouldn't be rushing across the road like that.
You know, you might have been killed.
Anyway, why aren't you in school?
It isn't a holiday, is it?
No, miss.
Do you live around here?
Yes, we live just down the road.
Come on, get into my car,
I'm taking you home.
Gosh, just wait till
Daddy hears we've been for a ride in a motorcar!
Yes!
What's your name?
I'm Jemima.
And I'm Jeremy.
What's yours?
Truly.
That's a very pretty name.
Now, where is your house?
Oh, we don't live in a house.
We live in the castle on top of the hill.
A castle? I didn't know there were any castles around here.
Well, it isn't a castle exactly.
That's what
Daddy calls it.
He says King Alfred used to live there hundreds of years ago.
And does your daddy know you aren't in school?
Oh, he won't mind.
He never does.
Anyway, he's awfully busy.
Is he?
Well, he'll have to find time to see me, because I have a few things to say to him.
JEMlMA: Edison! Edison!
JEREMY: Come here, boy!
Good boy, good boy.
That's Daddy over there.
JEMlMA: Hello!
JEREMY: Hello!
Hello.
You're just in time.
What on earth is he up to?
JEMlMA: That's his latest invention.
Rockets.
Rockets?
Stand back!
Keep clear!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Does he know what he's doing?
Of course he does.
Whoa!
Well, I don't see anything funny.
Somebody should do something about it.
Hold on! Hold on!
Wait! Wait there.
Oh!
Thank you!
I should hope so.
You might have gone up in flames.
Madam, I took that into consideration.
This suit is completely flameproof.
Oh, dear.
You have just succeeded in ruining my propulsion unit.
But how was l to know that you were. . .
Don't be cross with the lady, Daddy.
JEREMY: She gave us a ride in her car.
JEMlMA: She was only trying to help.
How very kind.
Her name's Truly.
That's nice.
Do you realize,
Mr. Potts, that I nearly knocked down your two children?
Well, we do seem to be accident-prone, don't we?
But it wasn't my fault.
You see, they came rushing out. . .
Oh, well, it was very, very nice of you to apologize.
Apologize?
Tea time, children.
Bye-bye, Truly.
Thanks for the ride.
Just a moment, you two.
Don't you have something to tell your father?
Yes, we have.
Daddy, Mr. Coggins promised us. . .
But she didn't mean about that.
Daddy, we didn't go to school today.
Oh-ho.
Well, it'll give the other children a chance to catch up, won't it?
Run along, children.
Goodbye.
Goodbye. Bye, Truly.
Come on, Edison.
But, Mr. Potts. . .
Good day!
But, but. . .
Unstable.
Definitely unstable.
Good afternoon, miss.
Sorry I can't stop.
I'm off to India.
Going to have a cup of tea with the Maharajah. Cheerio!
Mr. Potts.
I'm sorry to persist about this, but perhaps you simply aren't aware that your children were running about in the road.
And after all, you know, it's not a playground.
It's very. . .
Would you mind just pressing that switch there?
Switch?
Yes, just behind you.
On the right.
The right.
The right?
Thank you.
You really ought to try and exercise more control over them.
Yes, I suppose I could chain them up, couldn't l?
On a nice long chain, of course, so they get plenty of exercise.
Mr. Potts, don't your children go to school?
Oh, I have it now.
You're the truant officer.
No, I'm not the truant officer.
Well, didn't you ever play truant?
I mean, just once?
No, I most certainly did not.
I bet you didn't.
Would it be too much to ask what this is, this, um, thing?
A little invention of mine, cleans carpets by suction.
All that to clean carpets?
Away with sweeping, and away with brushing, and away with dirty carpets.
Is that all you do,
Mr. Potts? Invent things?
Is that all I do?
And what's this gadget?
Well, that's not quite right yet, but eventually,
I hope to transmit moving pictures by wireless.
Oh, really?
Yes, really.
That's my. . .
And this?
This, madam, is a sweet-making machine.
And is this one of the sweets?
Yes, it is.
And is it supposed to have all those holes in it?
No. Actually, I think that the problem is. . .
The boiling point of your sugar is too high.
Oh, we're an expert on sweet-making, are we?
Well, as a matter of fact. . .
And an expert on child welfare.
I was only trying to help your children.
Well, maybe my children like running wild in the street.
Did that ever occur to you?
I do not see any cause to. . .
And in any case, how my children behave is frankly no concern of yours.
I was merely trying. . .
So, if you'll be so good as to take yourself off in that fancy automobile of yours and go do good somewhere else.
Well, I've never been. . .
Spoken to that way before?
Well, maybe it's about time.
Good afternoon, madam.
Mind the cable!
Vicious, interfering. . .
If women are going to drive motorcars around, they should learn to operate one correctly.
Well, I suppose it wouldn't occur to you to offer to help me.
Get in the car. Please.
Well, for a mechanically-minded man,
Mr. Potts. . .
Try switching it on.
Oh.
Hmm!
Open the throttle!
And keep it open!
Women!
Confounded woman!
Who does she think she is?
Coming in here and telling me how to raise my children.
Do I need somebody to tell me how to raise my children?
Do l? Hmm?
No, of course not.
Of course not!
Where's my cardigan?
Under your jacket.
Under. . . Yes.
Self-righteous busybody.
She won't be bothering us again.
But I liked her.
So did l.
She was very pretty.
She certainly was.
Do you think your father's a crackpot?
Your cardigan's inside out.
Oh.
Do you think
I'm a lunatic, wasting my time on a lot of silly inventions?
But they aren't silly.
They're wonderful.
Nobody else could think of them.
That's right. That is right.
Nobody else could think of them.
Yes. After all, what makes the battle worth the fighting?
What makes the mountain worth the climb?
What makes the questions worth the asking?
The reason worth the rhyme?
(SINGING) To me, the answer's clear
It's having someone near
Someone dear
Someone to care for
To be there for
I have you two
Someone to do for
Muddle through for
I have you two
Someone to share joy or despair with
Whichever betides you
Life becomes a chore
Unless you're living for
Someone to tend to, be a friend to
I have you two
Someone to strive for
Do or die for
I have you two
Could be we three get along so famously
'Cause you two have me
And I have you two, too
BOTH: Someone to care for
To be there for
I have you two
Someone to do for
Muddle through for
I have you two
Someone to smile once in a while with
Whenever you're lonesome
I've a happy lot
Considering what I've got
But I couldn't do more
Than you do for your poor father
Daddy!
Daddy!
Things go asunder
And I wonder why you bother
ALL: Could be we three
Get along so famously 'cause
BOTH: We two have you
And I have you two
Too
Jeremy.
Oh, good.
Do I smell food?
Bring the bread, will you, Grandpa.
Yes, sir! Sir! Sir!
And pepper and salt, please.
Right away, sir!
Oh!
Sausage and egg, my favorite!
How was India?
India?
I'll tell you something.
I got up this morning, and I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
How he ever. . .
ALL: Got into my pajamas,
I shall never know.
You've heard it before.
Now, I wonder how that could have happened.
Daddy, could we ask you something?
It's about Mr. Coggins.
Mr. Coggins.
You see, the junkman wanted to take it away.
But Mr. Coggins says if we asked you first. . .
Asked me what first?
He's a horrid, mean, old man.
Mr. Coggins?
No, the junkman.
He's going to take it away and put it in a furnace.
And burn it all up.
It's terrible.
What are you going on about?
BOTH: Our car!
Yes, well, what about it?
Mr. Coggins is selling it to the junkman.
And the junkman's going to put it in the fiery furnace.
And squidge it all up till there's nothing left.
Oh, well, that's terrible.
That is terrible.
We can't let that happen, Grandpa.
No, definitely not.
We knew you wouldn't let them, Daddy.
So we made Mr.
Coggins promise we could have it if you gave him
30 shillings.
Uh, 30 shillings.
JEREMY: You can give
Mr. Coggins the money in the morning, Daddy.
Yes, well, I suppose we can work something out somehow.
Good!
Hooray!
Are you all finished?
Yes, Daddy.
Yes, thank you.
Well, I think, maybe, you should go run up to bed.
Good night, Grandpa.
Good night, my boy.
Sleep tight.
Good night, Grandpa.
Good night, my darling.
God bless you.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night.
Good night, Daddy.
Yes, well, you've done it now, haven't you?
You think Coggins might do a deal?
So much a week?
Coggins? What, him down the road? Sure.
He's so mean he wouldn't light your pipe if his house was on fire.
Did you hear that?
You know what that means, don't you?
I'll be up all night, rain pouring through my bedroom roof.
Grandpa, why don't you sleep in the workshop?
It's nice and. . .
The workshop?
You promised, faithfully, to fix my bedroom roof.
I will, Grandpa.
It's just. . .
Caractacus, please.
My boy, listen.
It's time you woke up.
When I was your age,
I did a day's work. . .
For a day's pay, polishing the Colonel's boots.
I was the smartest batman in the British Army.
So you've been telling me.
When my Brigadier went into action, the fuzzy-wuzzies were so blinded by the shine on his boots, they couldn't see to fight.
Catch me death of cold.
He doesn't care.
Nobody cares.
Me own son!
She was right.
Who wants sweets with holes in them?
Oh, Edison, stop that whistling.
Edison, hey, do that again.
Edison, you're a genius.
The employment office is in the rear.
Thank you. Oh.
You see, I've invented these sweets.
Really?
Name?
Uh. . .
Whistling Sweets.
Mr. Whistling Sweets.
Not Mr. Whistling Sweets.
No, I'm Potts.
Hmm.
May I see the managing director?
Lord Scrumptious sees no one without an appointment.
CARACTACUS: Well, how do l get an appointment?
Why, hello, children.
JEMlMA: Jeremy, it's Truly.
Hello, Truly.
Good morning,
Miss Scrumptious.
How nice to see you.
Good morning, Phillips.
Please tell my father that I'm here.
But of course,
Miss Scrumptious.
Are you here on business, Mr. Potts?
Yes, Miss. . .
Father?
Truly Scrumptious.
You're his. . .
His daughter.
Mmm-hmm.
Come on, children, let's go.
But, Daddy, you haven't shown anybody your invention.
Somehow, I don't think that'll do much good.
Just a moment,
Mr. Potts.
Exactly what was it you. . .
You've seen them.
Oh, those.
But they whistle.
Whistle?
Those holes.
You just blow through them.
They're very ingenious.
Kind of a novelty.
Please go in,
Miss Scrumptious.
You can come back in three weeks' time.
Show Mr. Potts in,
Phillips.
Now?
Now.
But his Lordship said. . .
Now.
Very well.
Please follow me.
Maybe I should come back in three weeks.
Oh, Daddy!
Go on, Daddy.
All right.
And don't let him bully you.
Yes.
Mr. Potts, milord.
Potts? Who's he?
Where's me daughter?
She insisted on
Mr. Potts seeing you.
All right, don't just stand there.
What's it all about?
Sweets, sir.
I hardly thought it was nuts and bolts.
Let's have a look.
Yes.
Hurry up, man!
Yes, sir.
If I may be allowed to explain, sir.
You have exactly
20 seconds.
Yes.
Well, the fundamental novelty of these particular sweets is their musical quality.
Not only are they remarkably tasty, but due to the unique positioning of these little holes, they are capable, when blown through, of rendering a tuneful whistle.
Place your fingers over the holes and blow thus.
Tasting time, milord.
Too late. Had your chance.
Muffed it. Good morning.
Go on. Follow him.
Milord?
CARACTACUS: Sir?
Excuse me.
Sir, if I may be allowed to demonstrate.
You see, by blowing air through this hole in the center of the sweet you get a wonderful-sounding. . .
Raspberry?
No, no.
It's more like a toot, really.
Not enough fruit, too much sugar.
Yes, milord.
Prepare the peppermint.
Beautiful. Would you care to try it, sir?
Under no circumstances.
Prepare the lemon!
He's not doing very well, is he?
You know, another remarkable feature about these little sweets is that by sucking on them. . .
Throw it away!
Will you get rid of this idiot for me?
Milord. You.
. . .in perfect pitch.
They also come in strawberry, raspberry. . .
Are you still here?
. . .lemon and. . .
And pineapple.
(MOUTHING) Go on.
Don't waste your pucker on some all-day sucker.
And don't try a toffee or cream.
If you seek perfection in sugar confection, well, there's something new on the scene.
A mouthful of cheer, a sweet without peer.
A musical morsel supreme
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The candies you whistle
The whistles you eat
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The eatable, tweetable treats
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The toot of a flute with the flavor of fruit
Toot sweets, toot sweets
No longer need candy be mute
Don't waste your pucker on some all-day sucker
And don't try a toffee or cream
If you seek perfection in sugar confection
Well, there's something new on the scene
That mouthful of cheer
That sweet without peer
That musical morsel supreme
That musical morsel supreme
BOTH: Toot sweets, toot sweets
A bonbon to blow on at last has been found
Toot sweets, toot sweets
With tweetable, eatable sound
No! Take it away!
Father, please.
He likes it!
(SINGING) Their value is intrinsic
Surpass any mint stick
BOTH: Or marshmallow mouthful you munch
Though licorice is chewy
And gumdrops are gooey
And chocolate is charming to crunch
That savory fife
That sweet of your life
It's clearly the best of the bunch
Toot sweets, toot sweets
That savory fife
That sweet of your life
Is clearly the best of the bunch
Toot sweets, toot sweets
A bonbon to blow on at last has been found
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The treat that's so tweetable
Lusciously eatable
With that unbeatable
Sound
Get out of here!
Go away!
What's going on?
Get those dogs out of here!
Edison, no!
Edison! Edison!
Children!
JEMlMA: Edison!
Edison!
It's entirely your fault.
I'll send for the police.
Daddy.
Now, why aren't you two asleep?
Don't be sad,
Daddy.
It wasn't your fault.
It was all those mean, old dogs.
Children, about the car. . .
You see,
30 shillings is pretty hard to come by.
And when I do get any money,
I need it for my inventions.
Well, there isn't any left.
Jeremy and l have been thinking.
It's our treasure chest.
These things are enormously valuable.
Look, an ivory tusk.
JEREMY: That must be worth a fortune.
JEMlMA: And diamonds.
And a golden crown.
It's probably
King Alfred's.
Of course, it needs cleaning up a little.
Take them, Daddy.
You can sell them.
And never mind about the car.
You can spend it all on your inventions.
Thank you, children.
All these wonderful things, they're very precious.
But I'm afraid other people wouldn't appreciate them.
Why not, Daddy?
Because other people don't see things the way you do.
Come on, now.
Let's go to bed.
And don't you worry.
Things are going to come right somehow.
(SINGING) A gentle breeze from Hushabye Mountain
Softly blows o'er Lullaby Bay
It fills the sails of boats that are waiting
Waiting to sail your worries away
It isn't far to Hushabye Mountain
And your boat waits down by the quay
The winds of night so softly are sighing
Soon they will fly your troubles to sea
So close your eyes on Hushabye Mountain
Wave goodbye to cares of the day
And watch your boat from Hushabye Mountain
Sail far away from Lullaby Bay
(CIRCUS MARCH
PLAYlNG DlSTANTLY)
All the lovely colors.
Two for the price of one.
Get your balloons here!
MAN: Hurry, hurry, hurry along now.
Don't miss these lovely toffee apples!
Hurry along now!
Get your toffee apples at 8p each.
Thank you very much, young man.
Any more for any more?
Which one of you lovely ladies and gentlemen would like a splendid, automatic haircut?
I've stood in this marketplace for 25 years.
I do not profess to make dead men talk!
(LOUDLY) Hey, now, here you go then. Who's for an automatic haircut?
Only three pence a time.
You may have long hair, you may have short hair, sir, you may have straight hair, it makes no difference to the Potts automatic and hygienic, electronic hair-cutting machine!
Come on.
You could do with a haircut.
Cut me hair?
That's where me strength is.
Excuse me, sir, you look like a man who could do with a haircut.
Bah!
Yeah, go on! Go on.
Come on, sit down.
Hold that, then.
My word, you have a lot of hair.
Would you like an estimate, sir?
Very funny.
Go on, get on with it.
You just sit tight, sir, while I lower this hair-cutting machine.
There we are.
You just relax, we'll have you finished in a bit.
I feel like a real right nana sitting here.
No, you look lovely, Cyril.
It's going to be smashing.
You keep your eyes on that geezer.
Yeah, all right, then.
What's going on?
It's all right,
Cyril, it's all right.
Nothing to worry about, sir, a little friction to start.
It tickles!
Oh, you always say that, Cyril.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Cyril, you're smoking!
I'm on fire!
Stop it!
Oh!
Excuse me!
Me head's on fire!
It's all right, sir.
What you done?
Give me a mirror.
Let's have a look.
A mirror?
I'll go home and get you one.
Me hair! Look at me hair!
Where is he?
I'll kill him!
There he is, mister!
Cyril!
I'll smash your teeth down your throat!
You!
Come on, you're too fat to catch him!
Oi! Big bonce!
Get out of here.
There he is!
Get out of my way!
Oi!
Here, hurry up.
We're on.
Get out of the way!
Get out of it!
(SINGING) A gentleman's got a walking stick
A seaman's got a gaff
And the merry men of Robin Hood
They used a quarterstaff
On the Spanish plains, inside their canes
They hide their ruddy swords
But we make do with an old bamboo
And everyone applauds
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Me old bamboo, me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother with me old bamboo
When punting on the beautiful Thames
You use a sturdy pole
To protect their fair complexion
Ladies use a parasol
It's useful in the underbrush
To have a hefty spear
Right!
But what we do with an old bamboo
Makes everybody cheer
One, two, three
Me old bamboo, me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother with me old bamboo
Have a go, mate!
A flier in an aerial plane
He steers it with a stick
He does?
A collier in the pits of Wales
He leans upon his pick
That's right
Now every wheel of an automobile
Revolves around a shaft
But what we do with an old bamboo
Makes everyone go daft
And one, two
Me old bamboo, me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother with me old bamboo
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
And a-one, two, three, four
And a-five and six and seven
Me old bamboo, me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother with me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
Thank you.
Here, thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
CHlLDREN: It's Daddy!
It's Daddy! He's got the car!
Look! I've got it!
He's got the car!
He's got the car!
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Hello!
BOTH: The car!
What do you think of this?
Isn't she a beauty?
Oh, Daddy! Oh!
That's a nice pile of junk you got there, my boy.
Well, it needs a little work, but there's a fine engine under here.
GRANDPA: It doesn't go, though, does it?
No, not yet, but it will. It will.
You can make it go, can't you, Daddy?
Well, I'm gonna give it a try.
All right, come on, everybody, put a hand to the wheel.
George, give us a hand here, will you?
Yes, sir.
Okay, heave!
JEMlMA: We're off!
We're off! Hooray!
Comfortable, Grandpa?
Won't work, of course.
Another catastrophe.
Left hand down.
JEREMY: Come on,
Grandpa, push!
Watch it, Jeremy.
Mind the bicycle.
JEMlMA: Push.
Good. Keep coming, Jeremy.
That's it. Keep coming.
Look out, Edison.
Watch out, Edison.
Look out, Edison.
That's it.
Keep coming.
Good. Whoa! That's it.
Whoa!
All right, governor.
Many, many thanks, George.
Right.
Now. . .
Can we stay and watch, Daddy?
Yes!
No, come on, my dears, we'd better go.
You know what your dad's like when he's working.
JEMlMA: But, Grandpa, we wanted to stay and watch.
GRANDPA: Come back in the house, darling.
I'll make you a nice cup of tea.
Don't overdo it, will you, my boy?
Right, Grandpa.
You might exhaust yourself.
Come on!
"And the big brown bear
"came lolloping over the mountain.
"'No, no,' the princess cried.
"And the big brown bear came lolloping over the mountain."
It's awfully quiet in there.
Come on, children, breakfast is ready.
He's been there for days!
Will you please come and have your breakfast?
But Daddy said the car would be finished today.
Darling, you'll be waiting a month of Sundays before he's finished that.
Come on.
Be good children.
Come on.
That's Daddy!
The car.
He's finished the car!
Gosh!
Oh!
Well, what do you think of her?
JEMIMA: She's the most beautiful thing
I ever saw in my life!
It's wonderful! Oh, Daddy, you're so clever.
Oh, yes.
Can we go for a drive?
For a drive?
A drive. A drive.
I have a better idea.
How about a picnic?
BOTH: Hooray!
A picnic! A picnic.
All right?
Let's get cracking.
You get the basket out of the workshop.
Get in, Jemima.
Hooray! Hooray!
Hurry! Mind the woodwork.
Mind the woodwork.
Don't touch.
Don't touch the horn.
Here's the basket, Daddy.
Oh, yes.
Just put it on the back.
All right.
Now. Don't touch that.
BOTH: Grandfather! Come on.
We're going on a picnic.
Get aboard, Grandpa.
Come on, come on.
It'll never go, my dears.
Not if he's had anything to do with it.
But it is going!
Hooray!
Then it'll never stop.
Anyway, it's far too hot.
Where are you going?
Me? I'm off to Alaska, me boy. Cheerio!
BOTH: Goodbye, Grandpa!
Come on, Daddy!
All right.
Come on!
Come on!
We're off!
Hooray!
We're off! We're off!
Sit down, Jemima, sit down.
Are you ready?
Yes!
Here we go!
Hooray!
Mind your back, Grandpa.
Bye, Grandpa.
Nasty, smelly things, motorcars!
What a funny noise it's making!
It's talking to us.
All engines talk.
What's it saying?
It's saying, chitty, chitty, chitty, chitty.

Look out!
You'll find a slight squeeze on the hooter an excellent safety precaution,
Miss Scrumptious.
Never mind about that.
How am I supposed to get out of here?
Well, looks to me as if you have to walk.
Or swim.
What? In this dress?
Oh, don't be ridiculous,
Mr. Potts.
Come on.
(STAMMERING) What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna carry you.
Oh, dear, must you?
Well, unless you'd rather ride piggyback.
All right.
You may carry me.
Good.
Wait, wait, wait.
My handbag. Oh!
Whoa! Oh!
It's all right.
Thank you.
Not at all.
We're going to the seaside.
On a picnic.
Come with us.
Please.
Well, I'm hardly in the mood for a picnic just now.
Well, you needn't worry about your car.
I can have Mr. Coggins tow it out.
Well, I. . .
We've got sausage tarts.
And marmalade rolls.
I'm afraid I got 'em a little mixed up.
What an unusual car.
Daddy made it.
Oh. And it actually goes?
It's called
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
That's a curious name for a motorcar.
But that's the sound it makes.
Listen.

Oops!
I'm so glad you came.
It's much more fun with two grownups.
Truly Scrumptious.
You know, even if we didn't know your name, we could have guessed it.
Oh?
You had to be called something lovely.
Like Yum Yum!
Or Angel Cake.
Or Toot Sweets.
Yes. Toot Sweets.
(LAUGHS) Toot Sweets?
Oh, no.
(SINGING) Toot sweets sound like what they are
So do lollies in a lollipop jar
Gingerbread men have a gingerbread sound
We've found
Sugarplum, cinnamon, and lemon tart
Tell you what they are right from the start
And your name does the same for you
By coincidence,
Truly Scrumptious
You're truly, truly scrumptious
Scrumptious as a cherry peach parfait
When you're near us
It's so delicious
Honest, Truly
You're the answer to our wishes
Truly Scrumptious
Though we may seem presumptuous
Never, never ever go away
Our hearts beat so unruly
Because we love you truly
Aw!
Honest, Truly
We do
CHlLDREN: Daddy! Daddy!
Boo!
Truly scrumptious
You two are truly scrumptious
Scrumptious as the breeze across the bay
When you're smiling
It's so delicious
So beguiling
You're the answer to my wishes
Truly scrumptious
You two are truly scrumptious
And I shan't forget this lovely day
My heart beats so unruly
I also love you truly
Honest, truly
I do
Come on.
Hey, wait for me!
Mr. Potts.
Somebody call?
Oh. (GROANS)
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.
That's all right.
What are you doing?
Oh, just tinkering.
Oh.
You know, Mr. Potts, you have two wonderful children.
Why, thank you.
I must agree with you there.
Isn't it beautiful?
Lovely. Just lovely.
Jeremy, it's not nice to peek.
I'm not peeking,
I'm looking.
Do you think they like each other?
Of course they do.
Do you think they're going to get married?
Has he kissed her yet?
Not yet.
Well, just as soon as he kisses her then they'll have to get married.
JEMIMA: Jeremy, what are you doing?
JEREMY: I'm keeping a lookout for pirates.
There aren't any pirates around here, are there, Truly?
Oh, I'm sure there are.
Hundreds of them.
'Course there are.
This is where they bury their treasure, isn't it, Daddy?
Mmm-hmm.
Tell us a story about pirates, Daddy.
A story about pirates, huh?
Well, let me see.
A boat!
I can see a boat!
A boat?
Did you say, "a boat"?
That isn't just any old boat out there.
No?
No?
(lN GERMAN ACCENT) No.
That is a private yacht of the notorious Baron Bomburst.
Baron Bomburst?
Baron Bomburst?
You have never heard of Baron Bomburst, ruler of Vulgaria?
The most evil man in the world!
CHlLDREN: Oh!
Yeah.
And he has sailed all the way to England because he has heard tell of a fantastic motorcar built by that brilliant inventor
Caractacus Potts.
Hooray!
Hooray!
Yes, hooray!
And he has come to steal the car and take it back to
Vulgaria with him.
CHILDREN: No!
Yeah.
MAN: (EXCLAIMS) Yes!
That car!
MAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I want it! I want it!
I want it! I want it!
But, Your Excellency. . .
Are you giving me an argument?
No, Your Excellency.
Stand by the boats!
Stand by the boats!
Man the grappling hooks.
Man the grappling hooks.
And load the cannon!
Load the cannon!
He's awful.
He's terrible.
Not only that, he isn't even nice.
But he can't steal our lovely car!
You won't let him, will you, Daddy?
Look!
They're getting closer.
We've got to get away!
Start the car.
Quickly, Daddy, before they get here.
Well, now, that's easier said than done.
But why, Daddy? Why?
Well, I'll tell you.
What none of us have noticed is while we've been sitting here, the tide has been coming in.
Now, we're completely cut off.
What are we going to do?
Do hurry, Mr. Potts!
Now don't panic.
Everyone, stay calm!
Quickly, Daddy.
Quickly. Hurry up.
Look! They are completely cut off by the tide.
They will all drown!
I haven't seen a good drowning in years!
Is there anything
I can do to help?
The throttle.
Push the throttle lever.
JEREMY: Hurry, Daddy! Hurry!
Quickly, Daddy, before they get here!
No, not that one, the other one!
It's no good.
It won't start!
We're gonna have to swim for it.
Come on, Jemima.
We must. Come on.
Come on, Jeremy.
We have to.
Come on, everybody over the side.
Quickly! (GASPS)
It's starting to change!
CARACTACUS:
Everybody, hold on!
TRULY: It's unbelievable!
Mr. Potts, it's so clever!
This is impossible!
But you built it!
It's a magic car.
You always said it was a magic car.
I did?
JEREMY: Yes. Look, it's like a boat!
I knew Chitty would save us!
Hang on, everybody!
We're off!
A floating car?
What do you think of that, Chancellor?
Yeah, Baron.
A car floating, floating on the water.
This, in my whole life long, it never could be seen, never, never.
It's uncategorical!
A fuel-burning oracle.
Phantasmagorical machine!
(SINGING) It's more than spectacular
To use the vernacular
It's wizard
It's smashing
It's keen
Oh, Chitty, you Chitty
Pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you
And, Chitty, our Chitty
Pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang loves us too
High Chitty, low Chitty, anywhere we go
On Chitty Chitty we depend
Bang Bang,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
Our fine four-fendered friend
They're firing at us!
All right.
We'll show them something.
Follow that car!
Follow that car!
My word!
I want the car!
I want that car!
I must have it!
Follow the car!
Stop that car!
After them! Faster!
I want the car!
I must have it!
Action stations, everybody.
We're going ashore!
Get out!
Where are my two spies?
Ah, there you are.
Now, then, I have a secret mission for you.
You will go ashore, and you will capture that motorcar, understand?
Good.
But if you fail,
I will cut off your heads.
Out.
I want that car!
Now, then, where are we?
I have here a map.
I know where we are, stupid!
We are in England!
And when we are in England, what do we do?
We play cricket!
We play. . .
No. We dress like Englishmen.
BOTH: A-ha!
Remarkable weather we are having for the time of year.
Do you not think so, Cuthbort?
Indubitably, Basil.
You know, Mr. Potts. . .
Caractacus.
It's a pretty silly name, isn't it?
Oh, I don't think so.
You know,
I really owe you an apology.
You're more than just a father to those two children.
Oh, yes.
Nursemaid, private tutor, chief, cook, and bottle washer.
Everything.
Except what they really need.
Well, it's been quite a day.
Yes, certainly has.
Thank you, (WHISPERING) and say goodbye to the children for me.
Yes, I will.
I hope we'll see you again.
I hope so, too. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
(SINGING) This lovely, lonely man
I've only known a day
I look at him
And cannot look away
Oh, what a love
Oh, what a lovely, lonely man
I've met so many men
So easy to forget
I thought I'd grown immune to them
And yet
He's such a love
He's such a lovely, lonely man
How did he touch my heart?
How did this feeling start?
This glow that feels so warm inside
This sudden summer storm inside
My life now has a plan
To someday make him see
That I need him as much as he needs me
Oh, what a love
Oh, what a lovely, lonely man
My life now has a plan
To someday make him see
That I need him as much as he needs me
Oh, what a love
Oh, what a lovely, lonely man
Oh, how I love this one and only man
Quickly! Quickly!
They're coming!
They're coming!
Hurry! They're coming!
Quickly! Quickly!
Come on. Hurry.
Come on! Come on!
They're coming!
Get ready.
Get ready. Fire!
Stop, stop, stop!
This way.
No! Stop! Stop, stop.
They're trying to get past, Daddy.
Fine.
Go on.
Get over, you half-wit.
It's Father. And he's in one of his tempers.
Oh, that'll be a change.
You'd better let him pass.
I can't.
There isn't room.
Get out of the way.
Move over, you idiot!
Turn off here.
What do you think you're doing?
We've got him!
Drive away from here.
Whoa!
LORD SCRUMPTIOUS:
You nincompoops!
I'll have you sent away for the rest of your natural lives.
I suppose you blue-faced baboons have some explanation for this outrage.
You stupid fool!
Why? What have I done?
What have you. . .
Ah, ah!
I have an idea.
Now, remember, we are supposed to be
English gentlemen.
So let us try and behave like
English gentlemen.
So open the door!
Caracatacacus Potts.
Inventor.
Typical English eccentric.
That must be the inventor.
Hmm.
Pardon me for protruding, but have I the pleasure of addressing Herr...
(CLEARS THROAT) Mr. Potts?
Yes, that's me.
What do you want?
You selling something?
I don't want nothing.
Excuse me.
I'm off to Africa.
Africa. (CHUCKLES)
That was a ruse to put us off the scent.
I know where he has gone.
Where? Where?
He has gone into his laboratory.
Quick! The portable wireless transmitter!

What's your game, then?
What's going on?
Oi, I'm flying!
Look!
JEREMY: What's that?
JEMlMA: It's a big balloon.
JEREMY: It's a zeppelin.
What's that underneath?
That's. . .
That's Grandpa's hut.
But what's it doing up there?
Well, I don't know.
Help me! Caractacus, my boy.
I'm being kidnapped!
Grandpa, what do you think you're doing?
You come down here!
Caractacus! My boy, it's me, your own father!
Caractacus!
They're not getting away with that.
Grandpa!
Hold tight, back there.
Sit down, Jeremy.
Quickly, Daddy, quickly!
Hurry, Daddy.
Caractacus!
Grandpa!
CARACTACUS: Hold on, Grandpa!
We're coming!
Help!
JEMlMA: Come back, Grandpa!
Hey, Grandpa, come back.
What do you think you're doing?
I'm being abducted by foreigners! Caractacus!
Hey!
Grandpa!
Faster, Daddy, faster.
Where do they think they're going?
(GASPS) Look out!
JEMlMA: Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!
(CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG
PLAYING)
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Where do they think they're going?
(GASPS) Look out!
JEMlMA: Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!
What's happening?
Look.
Look at that.
It's fantastic.
Oh!
You're a genius.
It's nothing, really.
Look! There they are!
JEREMY: Come on, Daddy, after them.
Right, we'll catch them up.
Oh!
Oh, we've lost them.
We'll find them, all right.
But what about Grandpa?
Don't worry about Grandpa.
Grandpa can take care of himself.
(SINGING) This is livin', this is style
This is elegance by the mile
Oh, the posh, posh traveling life
The traveling life for me
First cabin and captain's table regal company
Whenever I'm bored,
I travel abroad but ever so properly
Port out, starboard home
Posh with a capital
P-O-S-H, posh
We're losing height.
Jettison ballast!
The hands that hold the scepters
Every head that holds a crown
They'll always give their all for me
They'll never let me down
I'm on my way to far away
Ta-ta and toodle-loo
And fare thee well and bon voyage
Arrivederci too
Oh, the posh, posh traveling life

Jettison!
In every foreign strand I land
The royal trumpets toot me
The royal welcome mat is out
They 21-gun salute me
But monarchies are constantly commanding me to call
Last month I missed a mufti
Well, you can't oblige them all
Oh, the posh, posh traveling life
The traveling life for me
We're still losing height?
There must be something else we can throw out.
But there's nothing else we can throw out.
There's nothing else we. . .
No, no, no! No, no, no!
You just dropped someone!
I can't swim!
Come back. Come back!
Come back! Come back!
Oh, the posh, posh traveling life
The traveling life for me
First cabin and captain's table regal company
When I'm at the helm
The world's my realm

What do we do now?
Start swimming!
I don't swim.
Then start drowning!
GRANDPA: P-O-S-H
P-O-S-H, posh
Hello.
Where are we?
Somewhere over the North Sea, I think.
Don't you know where we're going?
No, I don't, but Chitty does.
I think we're in pretty good hands.
BARON: Good morning.
This is your
Captain speaking.
We hope you had a pleasant trip.
In a few moments we will be landing in Vulgaria.
Where?
Vulgaria.
Oh.
So, please, fasten your seat belts.
And no smoking.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Speed, four and a half knots, sir.
Wind, east-southeast, sir.
Brigade, attention!
Present arms!
We have a guest.
Welcome him.
Jawohl, your Excellency.
Order arms!
Ah, Professor Potts.
Please, to walk this way.
Present arms!
On behalf of
Her Majesty The Queen,
I'd like. . .
Oi! (WHISTLES)
Excuse me.
You're early!
Oh!
Down the table and in the pocket.
Cheat, cheat, cheat.
Ah, Professor Potts!
Professor?
Vulgaria welcomes the brilliant
Professor Potts, inventor extraordinaire.
Excuse me, sir.
There seems to be some sort of mistake.
What?
You are not Professor Potts, the inventor?
Well, l. . .
Executioner!
ALL: Executioner!
What would you like me to invent, sir?
I will show you. My horse!
MAN: Get the horse for his Excellency.
Giddy-up.
How proud you look on that fine horse.
The most beautiful toy you ever bought me, my darling.
But who is this?
This is Professor Potts from England.
How do you do, madam?
And I think we have a surprise for you.
Herr Professor, come on.
(BIDDING FAREWELL
IN FRENCH)
Well, what do you think, professor?
Everything you need.
And these will be your assistants.
And here, this is the Baronial car.
Can you make this car float?
Float?
Like amphibial
English moty car, float over the cresty wave of the water.
Yes, sir, but you see, it's not that easy without my laboratory.
Oh, I have already thought of that.
Here is your lavatory.
If you succeed in making the car float,
I will make you privy councilor.
But if you fail,
I will stuff your head with sauerkraut and feed you to the dogs!
Feedy dorribles, snarly (SNORTS) horribold.
You have got 24 hours!
Twenty-four hours and worky nosy grindstone.
Proper card he is.
Odd sense of humor.
Stuff me head with sauerkraut.
The Baron never makes jokes.
Look at us.
We've been here for years and years.
I came here to repair the telephone.
That was 24 years ago.
They have terrible tortures.
The thumbscrew and rack.
They stretch you and stretch you!
When I first came here,
I was a midget.
Come on.
Me? Floating car?
Well, that's impossible!
Nothing's impossible.
Now, that's what my son's always saying.
We'll help you, won't we, lads?
Nil desperandum.
We'll succeed. You'll see.
Courage, man, courage.
(SINGING) Every bursted bubble has a glory
Each abysmal failure makes a point
Every glowing path that goes astray
Shows you how to find a better way
So every time you stumble, never grumble
Next time you'll bumble even less
For up from the ashes
Up from the ashes
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Grow the roses of success
Oh, yes!
Grow the roses
Those rosy roses
From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success
Yes. I know, but he wants it to float.
It will!
For every big mistake you make
Be grateful
Hear, hear!
That mistake you'll never make again
No, sir
Every shiny dream that fades and dies
Generates the steam for two more tries
There's magic in the wake of a fiasco
Correct!
It gives you that chance to second guess
Oh, yes!
Then up from the ashes
Up from the ashes
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Grow the roses
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Those rosy roses
From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success
Disaster didn't stymie Louis Pasteur
No, sir
Edison took years to see the light
Right
Alexander Graham knew failure well
He took a lot of knocks to ring that bell
So when it gets distressing, it's a blessing
Onward and upward you must press
Yes, yes
Till up from the ashes
Up from the ashes
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Those rosy roses
From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success
Start the engine!
Success!
Batten the hatches!
Success!
Man the shrouds!
Lift the anchor!
Success!
Oh, Daddy, we'll never find him.
We must keep looking.
Look, look!
What's that down there?
CARACTACUS: A-ha!
Let's have a look.
Look!
The zeppelin.
JEREMY: We've found Grandpa!
CARACTACUS: No, not yet, we haven't.
BARON: What's that?
No, no, no.
What's happening?
MAN: Remarkable.
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency!
We're being attacked!
Attacked?
Attacked!
That was that terrible Bomburst.
It certainly was.
Where are they going?
Where did they go?
Look, it's a car!
Look, that car's flying!
Floating in the heavenly abode, four peoplebodes.
There they are!
Fire!
What's the matter with you?
Do you want to destroy my beautiful car?
They're firing at us.
Children.
There are children up there.
Children!
We'd better get away from here.
Now, hang on, everybody.
We're coming in to land.
Your Excellency, it's landing in the village.
In the village.
Call out the guards!
Everybody, charge!
And call out the child catcher.
Charge.
Charge! Charge!
Oh.
Let me in!
JEMlMA: Hooray!
We've landed! Hooray!
We've landed!
Hooray! Hooray!
Isn't Chitty wonderful?
Aren't you clever, Daddy?
Yes, he certainly is.
All right. You all stay here.
I'm going up to that castle.
We want to come, too.
We want to help you find Grandpa.
Don't you think we ought to stay together?
Maybe you're right.
All right, come along.
Come on, children.
TRULY: I wonder where we are.
CARACTACUS:
I don't know.
Come on.
Pardon me, sir.
The castle?
What's the matter with him?
Come on.
What are they staring at?
I don't know.
It seems to be the children.
What's the matter with them?
Haven't they seen children before?
Haven't you noticed?
There aren't any children.
Not one.
What's going on?
What's happening?
What's. . .
Hey, you. What's happening?
What's going on?
What is it?
Soldiers! Soldiers!
Hey, you there.
Get those children in here.
Would you mind telling me what's happening?
Quickly, before the soldiers get here.
Soldiers?
Come, Fräulein.
Quickly, quickly.
Get inside.
Just a minute.
Would somebody mind telling me what's going on?
Please don't talk.
We must get those children out of sight.
Jeremy!
If the soldiers find them, they will take them away.
But why? What for?
It's the law.
Nobody's allowed to have children in Vulgaria.
Not allowed?
What about these toys?
The Baroness, she hates children.
Who could hate children?
Quickly, down there!
Whatever you do, don't make a sound.
I want every house in this square to be searched from top to bottom!
Jawohl, Captain!
The first section, step out over there and search!
The second section, over there and search.
Quick!
Section three, over there.
Quick! Search!
Search everywhere!
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!
There are children here somewhere.
I can smell them.
A-ha!
Captain,
I think we've got them.
Lieutenant.
You two men, break down this door.
Quick! Quick!
Yes, sir!
Get this door open.
Quickly!
All right! I'm coming!
I'm coming!
Open the door!
Break the door down!
Quickly!
You have no right to come into here.
You've no right.
Search the place!
Search! Search!
A-ha!
They are here somewhere.
I can feel it in my bones.
There are children here somewhere.
Children?
In the toy shop?
Such a notion.
I mean. . .
What do you think you're you doing?
That's something special for the Baron's birthday.
Let me tell you, toymaker.
This nose of mine has never failed me, and if there are children here, my friend, you will die.
A-ha!
Quick! Open it up!
Get down there and search the cellar!
The Baroness will have your teeth for a necklace and your eyeballs for earrings.
Nobody down here, sir.
Fool! ldiot!
Out of my way!
You have to know where to look.
Like cockroaches, they get under the floors, in the cracks in the walls, in the woodwork.
I don't trust a man who makes toys in a land where children are forbidden.
Every toy I make is exclusively for his
Excellency, the Baron.
SOLDlER: Captain, Captain, the flying car!
We've captured the flying car!
CAPTAlN: Come on!
Let's go!
Uh-huh!
Take this car to the castle!
They can't take
Chitty, Daddy.
Daddy, do something.
They can't take
Chitty away.
What are you going to do?
Well, I don't know, but I'm not just gonna stand here.
Are you mad?
Are you going to take on the whole Vulgarian Army single-handed?
What kind of a country is this?
No children!
Everybody terrified out of their lives.
My friend, take some good advice.
Take your children and your good lady and get out of Vulgaria.
And leave Grandpa up in the castle?
Oh, no.
We came to get him out, that's what we're gonna do.
Just tell me how to get there.
Look, I'm only a toymaker.
And if I don't finish this in time for the Baron's birthday tomorrow,
I shall be a dead toymaker.
All right. I'll go myself.
Truly, you stay here with the children.
All right. All right.
You don't know what you're letting yourself in for, believe me.
Here's one for you, one for you.
Thank you.
Thank you, toymaker.
Keep them out of sight, please!
You be good children.
And you do what
Truly tells you.
Yes, Daddy.
We will.
TOYMAKER:
Well, are you coming?
(SOFTLY) Come.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.
There isn't a scrap of food in the place.
I'm so hungry, my tummy hurts.
Mine's making funny noises.
I simply must find something for you.
Now, if you promise me not to move from here until I come back. . .
We promise, don't we, Jemima?
Yes.
Now, you remember, you stay right here.
To get in that way, you would have to be a mouse or a magician.
We should go down now before a sentry sees us.
Come. Come.
Ah, the flying car!
At last it's mine!
Send for the inventor!
Then, fly!
Fly.
Yes, fly.
Come on, fly.
Fly, fly, fly. Oh.
I command you to fly!
Bring him over here.
Over here.
Hello.
What's this doing here?
You're the inventor.
Make this car fly.
Make it fly. Go get in.
Stand back, everyone!
We are going to fly.
Stand back.
Yoo-hoo, Bombie!
Wait for me!
No, every time I want to have a little fun, she turns up.
There you are. Get in.
My darling, we're going for a fly.
How exciting.
Fly. How thrilling.
Very well. Come on.
Hurry up.
Yes, yes,
I'm doing my best, sir.
Now just a minute.
Here's one that we haven't tried yet.
Here we go, my beloved.
Hold on!
Isn't it exciting, my dear?
Oh!
You're a genius.
My guns! Bring my guns!
Don't worry.
I'll get you down.
I've been waiting for this for 20 years.
Hold on, my love.
Are you still there, my love?
Don't move.
There she is,
Your Excellency.
Oh! Oh! My God.
My diamonds.
Are you all right, my dear?
I'm all right, my dumpling.
Good.
Never mind.
I'll get her the next time.
Here we are, children.
Come and get your lollipops.
Lollipops.
Come along, my little ones.
Lollipops.
Ice cream, chocolate, all free today.
Listen.
Come along, children.
Lollipops.
What's that?
Children, where are you?
I know you're here somewhere.
I've lots of lovely goodies for you.
Jeremy, you mustn't.
Lollipops.
And all free today.
Cherry pies. Cream puffs. lce cream. Treacle tarts.
Treacle tarts!
And ice creams.
And all free!
Come along, kiddie-winkies.
Come on!
But, Jeremy,
Truly said we mustn't. . .
We'll get Truly some as well. Come on.
Mr. Man!
Hey! Wait!
Children!
Come back here!
Wait! Wait!
Come along, my little dears, my little mice. Come to me.
What will it be? lce cream?
Yes, ice cream!
Strawberry, chocolate, vanilla?
Strawberry! Chocolate!
It's all inside.
Yes, strawberry!
Come along, my little dears.
Goodie! Come on. Yes!
Come inside.
Not a penny to pay.
Yes, come on.
Get in.
Go inside, my little dears!
No. Help, help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Children! Children!
CARACTACUS: Truly!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
What is it?
What's happened?
The children!
He took the children!
Your Excellency!
Let us out!
Let us out!
Silence!
Children,
Your Highness.
Foreign children.
Unique specimens.
You're sure they can't get out?
No, Your Highness.
Perhaps Your Highness would care to examine them.
Nasty little creatures.
Very, very treacherous.
Foreign.
Just you wait till our daddy hears about this.
He'll come and blow up the whole castle!
Take them away to the tower.
To the tower!
Nasty, horrid, mean old lady.
And very ugly.
Oh, she's going!
She's going!
Two hundred feet above us through that solid rock is the castle of
Baron Bomburst.
These are our children.
For 12 years, we have hidden them here.
Look at them.
They don't know what a tree looks like or what it is to run or to laugh in the sunshine.
Do you, eh?
Food!
Get the food here.
Come on!
There's bread for everyone.
Look at them.
Like little rats, they run up and down the sewers, stealing food from the kitchens.
. . .potatoes.
Here, catch!
Son! Son!
I'm looking for my children.
I think they're up there in the castle with their grandfather.
Have you seen anything of them?
No, sir.
A little boy and girl?
Yes.
They're locked up in the tower.
And the grandfather?
He's in the dungeon under the castle.
Sir, have you come to help us?
Are you going to take us out of here?
What's your name, son?
Peter, sir.
Well, Peter, you shouldn't be afraid, even in a terrible place like this, because there's always hope.
That's what I always tell my children when they're afraid.
(SINGING) A gentle breeze from Hushabye Mountain
Softly blows o'er Lullaby Bay
It fills the sails of boats that are waiting
Waiting to sail
So close your eyes on Hushabye Mountain
Wave goodbye to cares of the day
And watch your boat from Hushabye Mountain
Sail far away from Lullaby Bay
Is that the only advice you have to offer, my friend? Hmm?
It's a beautiful dream,
Caractacus, but I don't see how it's gonna help them.
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna get up into that castle.
It is impossible!
Well, we'll see.
Now, everybody listen to me.
You want to get out of here, don't you?
ALL: Yes! Yes!
Tomorrow is
Baron Bomburst's birthday, yes?
Well, we're gonna give him a birthday party he'll never forget.
I want everybody to gather around here.
I have an idea.
Yes, come in closer.
All right, quiet!
(SINGING) Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday, dear Bombie...
Don't move. What a picture!
Such memories it brings back.
My little dumpling!
(SINGING) You're my little chu-chi face
My coot-chi, coot-chi woot-chi little chu-chi face
Every time I look at you
I sigh
And you're my little teddy bear
My lovey lovey dovey little teddy bear
Yoo-hoo!
You're the Apfelstrudel of mein eye
Your chu-chi woot-chi nose
Your chu-chi woot-chi eyes
They set my heart aflutter
Your oot-chi, coot-chi ways
Your oot-chi, coot-chi gaze
Wilts me down like melting butter
You're my little chu-chi face
And you're my teddy bear
Together we're a chu-chi, woot-chi, oot-chi, coot-chi pair
Whatever you may ask becomes my happy task
I only live to serve you
I never will divine what magic made you mine
I only know
I don't deserve you
You're my little chu-chi face
And you're my teddy bear
Together we're a chu-chi, woot-chi, oot-chi, coot-chi
Chu-chi
Woot-chi
Oot-chi
Coot-chi
Chu-chi, woot-chi, oot-chi, coot-chi pair
Oh, what a rotten birthday party.
Never mind, my little Bombie.
I have a surprise for you.
Surprises?
Oh, I love surprises!
Sit down quickly.
Summon the toymaker!
Come on! Come on! Hurry up!
Don't waste time!
Your Excellency, may I be permitted to wish you all you wish yourself on this happy occasion.
Never mind all that.
What have you made me for my birthday?
What have I made you?
Such a toy!
Such a work of mechanical perfection.
Well, well, well, where is it?
Bring it in!
Right away.
I'll just get it for you.
Bring in the Baron's birthday present!
TOYMAKER: Here, here, here.
This year, Your Excellency,
I have surpassed even myself.
Put it down there.
Careful! Careful with it!
For months,
I have been working night und day perfecting every little detail to bring you this!
Dolls? Dolls?
I have hundreds of dolls!
(CRYING) No dolls.
But this is not just an ordinary doll,
Your Excellency.
You see?
(SINGING) What do you see?
You people gazing at me
You see a doll on a music box
That's wound by a key
How can you tell
I'm under a spell?
I'm waiting for love's first kiss
You cannot see
How much I long to be free
Turning around on this music box
That's wound by a key
Yearning
While
I'm
Turning around and around
(SINGING) What do you see?
Truly Scrumptious
You people gazing at me
You're truly, truly scrumptious
You see a doll on a music box
Scrumptious...
That's wound by a key
How can you tell
I'm under a spell?
I'm waiting for love's first kiss
Honest, Truly
You're the answer to my wishes
You cannot see
Truly Scrumptious
How much
I long to be free
Though I may seem presumptuous
Turning around on this music box
That's wound by a key
Yearning
My heart beats so unruly
Yearning
Because I love you truly
While I'm
Honest, Truly
I do
Turning around and around
Just a minute!
Oh, I'm so happy,
I could jump for joy!
Come on!
Follow me.
Children! No! No!
BARON: No! No!
No!
Let me down!
Call out the cavalry!
Let me down!
TRULY: Jeremy!
CARACTACUS: Jemima!
TRULY: Jeremy!
They could be anywhere.
You look down that way.
I'll go this way.
Jeremy! Jemima!
Jeremy and Jemima!
Jeremy! Jemima!
It's Truly!
Truly! We're in here!
Don't worry.
We'll get you out of here in a minute.
Here! Here, quick.
Quick, they're in there.
Children, are you all right?
CHlLDREN: Get us out of here!
We found them.
They're in there. Come on.
Help me break the door down.
Children, get away from the door.
Children!
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Let me down!
Ow!
My Liebchen, are you hurt?
My back is broken.
We must escape through the cellars.
Very well. Come on.
Come on!
Daddy, look at the children.
You stay here.
JEMIMA: Daddy!
What are you doing?
Where are all these children coming from?
I thought we had passed a law against children.
Quick. This way.
Where are we going?
Quickly. We'll go down here.
(GASPS) No, no.
I'll get my clothes dirty.
Don't argue.
Oh, my crown.
I lost my crown.
Oh, never mind, my little pumpkin.
Here.
Attack!
No! Daddy!
Look! There's Chitty!
Chitty's come to save us!
Hooray!
Hello, a motorcar.
What's that doing here?
There's Grandpa.
Grandpa!
Caractacus! My boy!
Are you all right?
Oh!
Stand back from the propellers.
Keep clear.
Bye!
Bye! Bye!
Bye! Bye!
CARACTACUS: And so, after that, Vulgaria became a free country, and all the children laughed and played in the sunshine, and they were very, very happy.
And Chitty flew high over the mountains back to England, everybody safe and sound.
And Daddy and Truly were married.
And lived happily ever after.
Yes.
Is that how the story ends?
It's getting late.
We better get back.
Well. . .
Goodbye, Jeremy.
Goodbye, Jemima.
Goodbye, Truly.
Will we see you again?
Oh, I expect so.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Truly.
I'm sorry about the children.
I hope they didn't embarrass you.
In what way?
Why, that silly joke about us getting married.
Well, you know what kids are like.
Yes, I understand.
I mean, I don't think they realize how ridiculous that would be.
Ridiculous?
Well, yes.
You live in that big house, your father, the factory and all.
It's a different world, Truly.
You know, if I said something like that, you'd call me a snob.
I didn't mean. . .
Goodbye.
Well, don't you want to ride up front?
Well, that was a fine picnic, wasn't it?
Shall we have another one tomorrow?
With Truly?
Yes.
Well, Miss Scrumptious has a lot of social engagements, you know.
Are we ever going to see Truly again, Daddy?
Well, we'll see.
JEREMY: Look, that's Lord Scrumptious' car.
CARACTACUS:
Why, I believe it is.
JEMIMA: I wonder what it's doing here.
CARACTACUS:
Well, I don't know.
Come on.
Excuse me.
Good afternoon.
Are you. . .
Boom! Boom! Boom!
That's wiped out your dashed cavalry.
Yes, sir.
But I have my 2nd
Infantry battalion attacking here from the rear.
Attacking from the rear?
That's dashed unethical.
Artillery, prepare to open fire.
Fire!
GRANDPA: Number one battalion, prepare to advance!
What's going on here?
There you are, young Potts.
Been waiting for you.
And that wiped out your artillery!
You're a cad, Potts.
Would someone mind telling me what's going on?
Fancy you being old Bungie's son.
Bungie?
Bungie Potts, best batman I ever had.
Weren't you, Potts?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
You mean that you were. . .
My boy.
Allow me to introduce to you my Brigadier.
Your Brigadier?
Potts. . .
How about some more tea?
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
As for you, young man, there's a very good chance you may be very rich.
CARACTACUS: Very rich?
What do you mean?
Those confounded sweets of yours.
Useless for humans, wonderful for dogs.
Woof Sweets, that's what we'll call them.
Woof Sweets?
Canine candies.
Dogs love them.
Make a fortune.
Daddy, Daddy!
You've done it, Daddy.
You've done it!
Have l?
It's the posh life for us all now, my boy.
We're all going to be rich!
Hooray!
Do you mean to tell me
I invented something that actually works?
Of course they do.
Wouldn't be offering you a contract unless they did.
Sign here, please.
Wait. Don't go away.
I'll be right back.
LORD SCRUMPTlOUS:
What about the contract?
But, Daddy, where are you going?
Daddy!
What's the matter with the fellow?
Well, he's a bit of an eccentric, sir, a genius, of course, but definitely an eccentric.
Can't imagine where he gets it from.
Truly, you'll never believe it.
I just got home. . .
This is beginning to be. . .
. . .and your father was at my house.
. . .a hazard.
I know! I know!
They told me at the house.
We're rich.
You know, more than that,
I have succeeded.
I always knew you would.
You know something else?
The kids were right.
There's nothing so ridiculous about the idea of getting married.
Well, whoever said there was?
Well, Mr. Potts.
What's the matter?
Now you'll have to marry me.
So dreams can come true.
Yes, they can.
Yes, they can, but you have to be practical, too.
You have to face the facts.
Man has to see things as they really are.
After all, a man with responsibilities can't walk around with his head in the clouds all the time.
A man should keep his feet solidly on the ground.
Oh, a man should have his dreams but a man has to learn to put those dreams to some practical use, not just sit around and think about them all the time.

Hi.
Can you spare four cents? Three cents?
Two cents?
Hi .. did you just arrive?
Well .. everything alright? Is It?
Well, you got a place to crash?
Some place to stay?
─ Yes.
Hey! Get out of the way.
Trying to get killed, you stupid kid?
What's a matter with you?     ─ Shut up!
Dope addicts! You think you can do anything you damn please.    ─ I'm deaf.
Oh .. poor little thing. She can't hear.
Hey man .. it's not money .. it's life.
It's human life. You don't invest it.
You spend it. You know what I mean?
You don't have to take acid to see that.
All you got to do is know where your head is at.
That's very nice. Very intellectual.
Very bright. Very nice.
But it's crap .. it's crap.
Yeah .. it is ..
─ Right Elwood?
Why ask me, man? I'm just an animal, here trying to make it.
Yeah, well you sure do got rhythm.
Hi Harry, how you doing? What's going on?
─ A poem, man. Read it.       ─ Oh yeah?
Hey, want some coffee?
─ Crazy. Good.       ─ What you say.
Stoney .. dig ..
─ Huh?
Dig.
Well, that must be wonderful. It offends me.
What is it?
─ A poster.
You got the poem, and the poster.
Hey Baby, are you a Gemini? Are you a Gemini? I'm looking for a Gemini.
No. Hey, you don't understand.
I'm a Leo. I'm a Leo, Baby.
And we are in phase. I mean that is, if you really are a Gemini.
Hey .. hey. Hey, I've found one.
Hey this one has just got to be a
Gemini man. I just got the vibration.
Sit right down over there, Honey. I've just got the vibes. You sit down there.
Beautiful.
What is it? Gold?
─ No, man. This is where it's at.
Ice bag.
Ice bag, huh?
─ I'll get you some.
Out of sight.
The Man. Could be narks.
You are totally uncool, man. You know that?
I heard you was a Gemini.
That's a good sign. There's a lot of pure energy in that sign.
Are these men bothering you, Miss?
Hey, I ain't bothering her, man .. she's a Gemini.
You know they're all public. Operators and waitresses are Geminis .. right?
I had a Gemini girlfriend once. Beard got so crowded I couldn't sleep.
What's your name?
Mine is "Stoney".
Pardon?
I said .. would you pass me the cream?
My name is Stoney. That's Ben.
And Elwood.
What's your name?
─ Jenny.
I think she's deaf.
Oh man ..
Come on, this lovely thing is happening, and you've got to make bad-taste jokes.
I'm not kidding you. She can read lips, but I'll bet you anything she's deaf.
What do you say, Elwood?
─ Bad taste, man.
Let's kill her and eat her.
What are you laughing at?
Wait, wait, wait!
─ Oh damn! Leave me alone!
Wait, just wait a minute. Just relax.
Oh wow.
─ Leave her alone, Stoney.
Oh now, wait a minute man,
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
I just want to ask her a question.
I'm deaf.
Hey .. that's cool.
Yeah alright. See, you're really deaf, right?
You can't see what I'm saying now, can you?
That's it Stoney. Hey man, nothing sacred, right?
Now wait a ..
Making fun of someone's infirmity. That's where you're at.
Wait a minute now, wait a minute. She knows I dig her, don't you? Don't you?
And I mean maybe she's just tired of all the sympathy stuff.
And maybe she'd like to be treated like an equal.
And she's really hot for me, aren't you?
Aren't you? What were you going to say? What were you going to say?
What were you going to say?
I'd like another cup of coffee.
I'll get it. Serving is part of my racial memory.
I'll get it .. I'll get it.
Why don't you stay here and do some more tricks for the lady, huh?
I will be the one who goes and gets the coffee.
You will sit here and
I will get the coffee.
If you see this girl around, call in will you?
Where have I got time to look at faces?
Take time .. this one is deaf .. and a runaway.
It's bad enough for a kid without problems that's caught up in this mess.
So, this is kind of a vacation.
─ Where you from?
She's a runaway. The Cops are flashing her picture around.
I'll be glad when this costume-party is over.
And these creeps grow up and start to make a living like everybody else.
Morning, brothers.
─ Brothers ..
Newcomers, aren't you? Everything okay?
Yeah, okay .. now shove off. Huh!
Hey man, that was kind of stupid, wasn't it?
I'm sorry, man.
Peace and love. Non-violence, remember?
You ain't being very hip at all, man.
Gone.
Peace and love to you too.
You got a place to go?
─ My brother lives here.
Alright.
─ No, really.        ─ Okay.
See you.
─ Thanks for the coffee.
So long.
You know, man is related to man .. things.
What I mean is everything is part everything else.
It really blows my mind.
─ It trips me out.
It grooves.
─ Beautiful, huh?
Where is our posters?
─ Over here.
You going to put them up today, Stoney?
Yeah, we need the business or we lose the gig.
Dave been in?
─ Not for a while.
The bastard's never here when you need him. Hasn't showed up to play in a week.
Hey, Stoney man. Where you from?
Everybody's got to do his thing, right?
Now, Dave's got his bag, and you got yours.
Hey Warren, did you get my drums fixed?
─ Yeah, man.
They don't sound so good without acid.
There you are, man.
I thought we played real bad last night.
Well Itchy thought it was real psychedelic, man.
He means crude.
─ We really dug the violence.
Next time, why don't we just break up our instruments.       ─ And fight.
And loot.
─ For love.
Pretty good grass.
You .. are in no shape to drive us.
I'll drive.
Beautiful.
Amazing. Really beautiful.
Okay. Bye-bye Elwood.
Here's for Elwood.
Shite.
Say man, houses are shite.
You okay, Elwood?
Have you ever seen The Universe explode over your head?
Hey Jenny!
Hey, it's not going to do you any good to yell, you know.
Oh yeah. That's right.
All I know is that he disappeared without paying his rent.
And I knew that I never should have had someone like him here in the first place.
She can't understand you unless she can see your lips.
Oh.
─ Do you need any help?
She says he's not here anymore.
─ Who, who?
My brother.
He split over a month ago.
I don't know where he is.
He didn't leave me his address.
Are you sure even he's in San Francisco?
Yeah, I'm sure .. look he sent me this card a week ago.
He just says .. he's not a very good speller.
Jess Saes: God is alive and well in a sugar cube.
Now, what do you suppose he meant by that?
Okay .. let's get in the truck.
Hey.
I don't know if we can find him.
But we'll sure try, okay?
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
─ Oh, that's alright.
You'll get picked up in 5 minutes if you don't get out of those square clothes.
What? I don't have very much money.
You don't need too much around here.
It's free. It's all free. You can have anything you want.
You mean, I can take the whole store?
─ That's right.
That's fantastic.
What do you think, man?
You think I'm red or what?
Oh Jesus ..
Hey up there.
Hey.
Do you like it? Shoot. Try it on.
What are you running away from?
People.
─ Oh yeah? Who?
I told you. I was looking for my brother.
That's not what I asked you.
I thought you said the clothes were free.
─ Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
I didn't mean anything.
I'm just curious.
You don't have to answer to anybody in this scene. That's what it's all about.
You know .. everybody does his own thing .. okay?
Here's some more.
Try these.
The message is .. peace.
─ Peace?
The message is .. music.
The message is .. staring at a crystal.
You mean, like searching for the truth, wherever we might find it?
No, man.
Hey Pandora .. why are you dancing by yourself?
I'm not.
I'm dancing with everybody.
If you know what I mean.
You want to talk?
─ Okay.
What about?
─ I don't know.
Pick the first word that comes to your mind.
Sanctuary.
Do you like our pad?
Jenny needs a place to stay, and everybody seems to like her.
I think .. I think she ought to stay here.
Where? It's crowded enough right now.
Old Stoney's got a pad all to himself.
Yeah.
It will scare him half to death. You now how Stoney is about chicks.
He's a one-nighter.
No involvements, no commitments.
Come on. Get in bed with me.
Man .. what would he say?
Who? .. He's okay.
You're an exception.
Hey Wesley.
─ What?
Your wife. She wants me.
Man, I've got my own problems.
He told me he'd pummel and pound me into motorcycle grease if I even look at you.
Well, uh .. there's a bathroom down the hall if you want to use it.
I can't see your lips too well in the dark.
I said ..
You can stay here tonight if you want to.
Thank you.
Hey.
Ouch ..
Everything cool?
Hmm.
What do you see?
Well ..
Through a stained-glass window.
There's something running on your sleeve.
I think it's a louse.
Yeah .. that's Manny.
Stoney, Stoney! Warren is freaking out at the gallery.
Okay Warren.
It's okay, everything is cool. No sweat.
I'm okay .. I'm really okay, man.
A few things have been happening, but ..
No, Stoney don't.
Easy, easy Warren. Easy.
─ Hey, easy boy. Easy ..
Easy, don't fight it, man. Whatever it is, just relax and go right with it.
You know, I'm okay. Yeah .. I'm fine.
I've been seeing a couple of things but ..
I can come out of it any time I want to.
You know, all I have to do is ..
Snap my fingers and I come out of it.
Al I ever have to do is snap my fingers.
─ Hey Warren.
Snap your fingers.
Well you see ..
It's not working this time.
It's just not ..
Guys .. now you stay away.
Stay away from me please.
Warren .. Warren, let us help you.
Warren, whatever it is, it's in your mind. It isn't real.
We're your friends.
Stay away!
No .. please ..
Stay away!
Now, you stay away .. please.
You just stay away.
Stay away.
Stay .. oh my God ..
Oh my God! I can't stand it!
I got to cut it off.
I've got to cut it off! I've got to cut it off!
─ It's okay .. it's okay.
I can't stand it!
It's okay baby, it's okay.
It's Elwood, it's Elwood.
Why does he take that stuff?
Don't judge people, Jenny.
I'm not judging. I just don't understand why anyone would do that.
Jenny .. Jenny, listen to me and try to understand.
There happens to be a risk in everything. Even crossing the street.
A man. He's got to search out for himself to get any rewards from life.
It's as simple as that.
─ Like that?
You don't understand. Listen, Nietzsche says that it's a very simple thing.
This is Steve's. My brother
Steve .. he made this.
Your brother made this?
─ Yes.
Well, I know him. They call him "The Seeker".
Do you know where we can find him?
Dave knows.
We've been looking all over for you.
─ Oh yeah? Why?
Because you're my friend.
And because we uh .. need you to play with us.
You still playing games, Stoney?
Since when is music a game?
Playing it makes me feel good.
So does a pay-check.
Yeah, the old bad thing.
The root of all evil, right?
No, not bad or good.
There is only the truth.
Oh, the truth. Old black-and-whitey.
Hello.
─ Hi.
We brought you some donuts.
─ Too nice. Thank you.
This is Jenny .. she's deaf.
She's lovely, man.
You know, I like sound, but sometimes I prefer silence.
Is she your chick?
Not really.
No big thing?
I like her.
Then you don't mind if she stays here with me, then?
You know, that would be up to her, wouldn't it.
Still, games ..
You're beautiful.
Is .. love lesson number one over, man?
All the games have to go, man.
Because it's all one big, plastic hassle.
So live in a jelly jar.
─ You see this little beam of light.
Well, that's all there is.
The rest is in your head.
Yeah .. except we're in a box on a roof.
In San Francisco, in America.
So it seems.
So it seems?
Okay .. listen ..
We're looking for Jenny's brother.
Steve Davis. Do you know him?
Oh "The Seeker". Yeah, I know him.
Where .. where is he?
You seek The Seeker and
The Seeker seeks God.
Wouldn't you rather ask God?
We used to have long talks.
When he was lecturing in the park.
He had quite a big following.
Do you have any idea where he lives?
Well, I've seen him a couple of times around 9th and 4th.
But you don't have an address?
─ There is no such thing as an address. it's the city dump.
The Minister seemed like such a nice man.
How can he stand these people and the way they dress?
I've never seen so many .. things.
Things and more things that people spent their lives to buy.
An output of a productive society, man.
Junk.
It's getting late. We'll not find him wandering around in this garbage heap.
Let's get out of here.
Stoney, right there!
"JESUS SAVES".
─ It's got two letters missing.
He left out the "U" and the "V".
"JESS SAES".
So that's what it was.
Stoney .. Stoney, look
It looks like the right address.
All burned out, Stoney.
It's been abandoned.
A dead end.
Hey, look at the flower children.
The funny folk.
My, what a pretty little car.
Yeah, it looks just like a garden.
What's it run on? Fertilizer?
Flower power!
─ No, it flies, like a fairy.
You want to drive it?
─ Hey, water it and let's watch it grow.
Hey, ain't you kind of far from home? What are you doing here?
We're just looking for somebody.
Yeah, who's that?
─ Just a guy.
What's his name?
He's called "The Seeker".
What do you want him for?
I'm his sister.
Oh yeah?
Well, you'd better find him before we do, as there won't be anything left.
What's he done?
That's none of your business.
Well .. look what I've found. A real love child.
Nice long hair . oh, look at this pretty necklace of his.
Why .. why do you want to hurt my brother?
Because he's got a big mouth.
Because he says a lot of things we don't like.
What .. what kind of things?
Like .. speeches in a park. You know ..
Making .. love .. instead of war.
Hey, she's a flower child.
Maybe she believes all that stuff her brother says about love.
Hey, well let's find out, baby.
─ No!
You bastards! Stop it!
No .. no .. no.
No!
Don't touch me.
No .. no.
Peace, man. Peace ..
I guess he was a little high Stoney.
─ You okay, Elwood?
Whoo!
Man, beautiful .. really beautiful.
You should have seen it.
I was .. I was this frog ..
And a Princess kissed me.
And all hell .. broke loose.
Want to dance?
─ What?
Want to dance?
─ I can't.          ─ What?
I .. can't .. dance.
Why? It's easy.
─ I can't hear the music.
I forgot.
Well, wait a minute. I saw you tapping to the beat.
I was watching Stoney.
Say, do you guys have representation?
─ No we don't.
That's why we keep trying to write to Washington.
Cool it, Ben.
─ I'm an agent.
How would you guys like a chance at The Ballroom?
Great.
─ Give me a call.
I liked having you there tonight.
Too bad you couldn't hear the music.
What did that agent want?
To make us famous .. like The Airplane.
─ Hmm.
Better not let Dave hear that.
We didn't go looking for him.
I mean he came after us.
I mean, all I know about the guy, is that he's legitimate.
And that he said that he would get us in The Ballroom.
Two dollars and fifty cents will get you into The Ballroom, no problem.
David .. the acid has curdled and turned you sour.
No. I see my friend who'll soon be up to his eyes in dollars and self-importance.
Maybe I should cultivate him.
It's real good to see you in the daylight, though.
I know you just crawled out of your hole to save my soul.
Games again, Stoney.
Could be you're starting to need things and starting to want things.
And what you don't want töo much, they can't take away from you.
I don't need anything.
Well, pretty soon that little girl you're pretending not to notice.
That one standing right there with her eyes full of love.
Pretty soon you'll start worrying about whether you can afford her.
And then it's "buy now, pay later".
9 to 5 .. the rest of your life.
Pretty soon, the bogey-man will get me.
You're looking lovely this morning, Jenny.
Tell him I'm right. You're not one to play games. Tell him how it is.
I'm just catching a bus.
Good morning.
─ Hi, how are you?        ─ Fine
Come on, we'll be late.
─ Okay, come on, let's go.
Death.
Death is .. merely the instant passage to eternal being.
A final escape ..
From the travail that man has heaped upon himself.
It is a loss.
Only for the living.
We, who in our loneliness cherish his .. sweet .. memory.
And now .. while we celebrate his needless death.
We celebrate the end of death.
This glorious day when man has finally denied and revoked ..
His right to assassinate.
Denied and revoked his right to assassinate his fellow man.
War .. capital punishment.
Murder .. highway slaughter .. are but memories of an inhuman age.
An age before man discovered his primal urge.
And used it in the more creative act of "love".
Hold it, hold it. Hold it, hold it.
Ben, those are dotted quarters right there .. right here.
You come in. .. it's 3, 4. 1, 2. Then you come in with an open fifth .. okay?
Got you.
Alright, let's do it.
Ready? 1, 2, 3, 4 .. 1, 2.
Doesn't anybody care about anything? Or do anything?
Okay, alright .. let's do
Kaleidoscope next.
Stoney, I'm going out to take a walk.
Or maybe .. maybe Red River Dream is better pacing. I don't know.
Stoney.
Jenny, what do you want?
Can't you see that we're working?
I want to tell you I'm going for a walk.
─ Take it! I don't have a leash on you.
Alright .. fine!
Alright, come on. Red River Dream.
Ready?
Alright, okay. That's alright. I've got to take a break now. I'm tired.
I don't know why you're so uptight man.
The Ballroom is just another gig.
It was just another gig, man.
I'd like to get out of this world for about a week.
Hmm. How about a trip on STP?
─ Yeah, 72 hours, right?
I'm not getting near that stuff.
They don't even know what's in it.
They say it's LSD, cocaine and methedrine.
It's like driving a Ferrari with the gas pedal strapped to the floor.
I'll tell you what's in it . it's J.B. 314.
It's a derivative of a nerve gas that the Army developed.
That's what I heard, anyway.
The worse thing about it is, once you're up, you can't get down, you know.
And chlorpromazine just makes it worse.
You know. So, I'm telling you it's nothing to play around with.
I'm going for a walk.
─ You going to look for Jenny?
This is mine .. and it belongs to me.
I'm only taking what belongs to me.
Don't touch it .. it's mine.
It's Holy. God gave it to me.
It's a present from God to me.
He guided my hands when I made it.
You're Steve Davis, aren't you?
You've got to make that promise.
─ "The Seeker", right?
You have to promise me .. that you won't touch this .. and you'll let me go.
Yeah, heh .. don't worry, man.
I'm not going to touch you.
I'm not going to stop you from anything. Everything is cool.
I'm going to take this with me .. it's a shrine.
I need it for meditation .. the truth.
The truth is in the fire.
Listen Steve, your sister is here.
─ You know what I just said?
That's really true.
─ You're a little high so ..
Absolute concentration.
You can see the flame.
Your sister is here. We've been looking all over for you.
Your sister is here.
My little sister, Jenny?
─ She's been trying to find you, man.
You mean, that my little sister Jenny really made it?
Listen, you want to come with me right now, man? I'll take you to her.
Oh no .. no. I tell you what.
You give me a day to get my head straight .. and I will come.
Okay.
Don't tell her you've seen me here.
─ Okay.
She was the ..
She was the sweetest little kid.
Now, it's been a long time since I left her there.
Where?
Oh at the house where we were little.
I ran from the misery of that house as .. soon as I was old enough to.
I left there the day that ..
The day that they took her things away.
─ What things?
Kids’ things, you know.
Things that a little kid collects.
It was just a box of nonsense but they were important things to her.
They belonged to her.
A treasure-chest of inviolable personal belongings of incontestable ownership.
I mean that those things were hers. They belong to her.
You see, I had a mother, that was a very ugly woman. She had a fake awful voice.
A patient voice.
It was as stifling as the clothes that she wore.
And she had a hatred for everything that grew or walked.
Anything that had a chance in life, she hated.
She had one of those knowing ..
Understanding, forgiving smiles ..
Her touch was just like a .. sting.
She was clever too.
She was clever at thinking up new punishments.
And then .. and then
Jenny became like a ..
A wounded animal, a stricken animal.
That was in a great deal of pain.
She was snatching at air.
When she grabbed hold of my mother's leg, she was grabbing on to save her life.
She was grabbing on as if the limb was disembodied from her bitch enemy above.
Then it happened to her.
Something terrible happened to her.
She just didn't seem like a little girl any more.
She seemed like a dying animal that was trying to run away from its pain.
It was as if the most terrible thing that could ever happen to you ..
Had finally made itself clear to her.
And I .. I don't really remember what I saw.
Except ..
Something ..
Black, started sliding out of her mouth.
It was .. like she trying to spew forth all of her hatred.
Talk about a lack of communication.
People not being able to understand each other.
Now, Jenny's got it made.
Because .. since that day ..
That pitiful little thing has never heard a single sound.
Why so happy? Is it the fame or the fortune?
Oh man .. Dave, you bare relentless.
Tell me your philosophy, Stoney.
Let's talk about something important.
What color Continental will you buy?
Cantaloupe, man.
─ That's interesting.
Let me ask you this. How do you stand on monogrammed shirts?
Love them Mac, love them. Wear them for underwear all the time you know.
Anything with my initials on it.
Individual against the "collective, conforming society" and all that.
Well, I don't care what your bag is, man.
As long as you're honest about what you want.
Well, I'm honest Steve, very honest.
Listen Stoney, what you really want is that little broad that just groped you.
The one you made the date upstairs with.
What you really want to do is .. do that.
But here comes Jenny.
What are you going to do?
Shall we be honest and tell her the truth?
Or why not tell her you have a meeting with your agent and have to slip away.
Or you tell her you love her? She'll never know.
It's done all the time in straight circles.
Hi .. I've been looking all over for you, to congratulate you.
Go on .. tell her. I'll back you up.
Hi.
─ Hi ..
Hey .. why don't you come over and sit with me. I've got a supply of food.
You're all guts Tony .. go and have your dinner.
Well uh ..
I'm not real hungry right now, so maybe a little later, okay?
Besides, I've got something else that I have to do.
I think we've all got to do our own thing. Right?
Man, what a free spirit.
Well Jenny, I guess it's you and me.
You going to take that?
─ Yeah, I'll take it. You kidding?
Wow ..
You couldn't have been getting too much from Stoney anyway.         ─ No. Right.
And now Stoney's off .. having himself a ball.       ─ He sure is.
You're going to sit here and be a martyr.
Now, why do people play games like that?
Whether they made it with me is not the important thing.
It's facing your appetites and your curiosity.
I might be better than Stoney.
Close your eyes.
Hey, I can't close my eyes. Then
I won't be able to see your lips.
That's alright. Close your eyes.
The Phantom strikes again.
See, now you're angry.
You're angry at Stoney and want revenge.
Well I think anger is an honest emotion.
I'll help you get revenge.
Just beautiful.
Damn it Jenny, what the hell is the matter with you?
Hey, we've all got to do our own thing, remember?          ─ Shut up Dave.
Listen Stoney, nothing happened.
Nothing happened? What do you call
"nothing"? Did I get here a too soon?
Hey, get this middle-class morality.
Listen to the great free-thinker.
Stick around Dave. I'll be finished in a minute. Stick around and have a ball.
Damn it, stop it Stoney, stop it!
The moment of truth and you go square, Stoney.
Not at all man, not at all.
Use the pad. Have a ball.
I don't care and I'm sure the bitch doesn't mind, do you Jenny?
Don't turn me off!
I want to tell you don't dirty the sheets until I get another chick to clean them.
You're righteous Stoney, but you're not very hip.
Maybe I'm not.
In any case, don't forget to crawl back in your hole when you're finished.
Reality is a rotten place to be.
So, you want a shot of this? There's enough in there for two trips.
Dave .. Dave, I'm scared.
Don't be scared. It's cool.
You know ..
You know the only reason I came here .. was to find my brother.
How about this?
God is in the flame. What does it mean?
I don't know, a little esoteric for me.
But there's an address on the back.
Man, I'm stoned already.
Thanks!
─ Reality is a deadly bore.
Dave .. where'd she go?
She's far away.
Come on .. tell me.
─ She's on a trip.
A long trip.
What are you saying?
She's gone to the end of the Universe .. on STP.
And she's out on the street alone?
She's gone to seek The Seeker.
She hides and you seek her.
You sick, crazy bastard.
Do you understand that she does not know that drug?
And that something could happen to her? She could be hurt. Come on!
Hey, what is it man?
I don't know. He set fire to the house and he won't come out.
I don't know. Why doesn't someone jump out of the window?
Steve .. don't!
Steve .. Steve, please ..
Somebody help him .. help him!
Steve.
Steve, don't .. Steve! Steve!
No .. no! Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
No!
Jenny, don't move!
Jenny, stay there!
Dave .. don't!
Reality is a deadly place.
I hope this trip was a good one.
T-G.
Jan 2016.

Vacation is here
Beach party tonight
Well, there it is, honey, and it's all ours.
Just you and me all alone.
Exactly.
- It's just like we're married.
- Exactly!
There's nothing like the beach early in the morning.
It's so quiet and peaceful and mysterious.
- Come on. Let's get the stuff inside.
- Right now?
We've waited a long time.
You know, the only thing
I've studied this semester is you.
Well, I hope you don't flunk.
There's always summer school, you know.
Hold it, Dolores.
We've got to do this right.
It's like there's nobody else in the whole world.
That's right. Nobody else.
Just you and me.
- Just you and me.
- Exactly.
Hey!
- What's going on here?
- Deadhead! What are you doing here?
Sleeping. Good night.
Now, you get your big carcass out of here before I pick you up...
- You're gonna wake everybody up.
- Who's everybody?
There's just me and Ken...
Tommy y Big Boy.
I guess about all of us.
- Gee, what a wonderful surprise.
- Yeah.
I wonder who thought of this wonderful surprise.
This is such a big house, and
I didn't want you to get lonely.
She's all heart.
Well, you know it's more fun with the whole gang.
- Not what I had in mind!
- Frankie, that's just it.
I don't trust myself when I'm alone with you.
- You really put me on.
- Frankie...
"Just the two of us. Nobody else in the whole world. Like being married."
You're not going to get away with it.
I'm going to get rid of all these guys.
Then there's going to be the two of us... rattling around this great big house together.
Frankie!
- Hey. Wall-to-wall girls.
- What are you doing here?
Get out of here.
You get out and stay out!
- Take off.
- Thanks for the invitation, Frankie.
Where'd I go wrong?
Hey, you're gonna rub a hole right through it.
Hello, there.
Hi, there.
Come on. Let's go.
All right. You can go now.
- What do you mean?
- Get lost.
Well! I can see the headlines now.
"Famed Anthropologist Dr. R.O. Sutwell
Arrested as a Peeping Tom."
My dear young woman, at this moment, I'm concentrating... on developmental biology in human beings.
- That's what I mean.
- Marianne, I'm no match for your wit.
Here. Take a look, please.
Not me. I blush easily.
I'm a Philadelphia girl.
But tell me about it.
I presume you've guessed.
It's my new book.
By the way, how do you like this title?
"The Behavioral Pattern of the Young Adult
"and It's Relation to
Primitive Tribes."
- I've got a shorter title.
- What's that?
- Teenage Sex.
- You know, Marianne, it's absolutely fascinating how similar the behavior patterns... of these young people is to the other tribes we've observed.
Oh, come on, Professor, these are just normal American kids.
American, yes. Normal, no.
Marianne, they're a true subculture.
They live in a society as primitive as the aborigine of New Guinea.
Now, listen to this, quickly.
- Dis you dig his action?
- His action?
He was hanging ten, when he tried to shoot the pier, and dinged his board just when he took the air.
- Maybe you've got a point.
- You bet I have.
I'm gonna need reference books All of
Max Jacobson's works on puberty rites.
Murchison's studies of the Aztec fertility symbols at Spanish Key.
Coming of age.
That sort of things.
Marianne, this book will be my triumph.
And you'll never get it through the mails.
But hang on the picture rights.
American International will snap it up in a minute.
- I take then that you won't help me?
- Have I ever said no?
Come to think of it, you never have.
I'll help.
Thank you, Marianne.
- On one condition.
- Yes? What's that?
After you write this book on sex...
Yes?
Read it.
Rhonda, what are you doing?
Watch. They come all unhinged.
See, it works every time.
At the present time
I am secluded approximately...
37 to 40 yards from the subject group.
Did it ever occur to you that there's something else in life... besides getting a boy?
- Like what?
- Love.
Here's something now.
Here's something coming in.
What's your problem? Frankie giving you the cold treatment or something?
Deep freeze would be more like it.
You can't really blame him.
He brought you down here alone, and you turn the place into a teenage flophouse.
Well, at the last minute
I got cold feet.
If somebody had wild plans for me, why stop him?
Rhonda, I want Frankie to think of me as more than just a girl.
- There's something else?
- Yes! A wife
Wife? Dee Dee, you're not even a woman.
But I'm close.
And I'm not getting any closer until I'm a wife!
Dolores, come here!
The music you hear in the background they're playing...
Oh, brief footnote on comparison to Haitian voodoo ceremonial.
Well, along the coast past Malibu
I make it every day after school is through
My secret surfing' spot where only I know
- The gremmies and the hodads never go
- Never go
I said the gremmies and the hodads never go
Incredible.
Well, I'm hotdogging on my board till the sun goes down
I jump into my woodie and I make it back to town.
My secret surfing' spot where only I know
- The gremmies and the hodads never go
- Never go
I said the gremmies and the hodads never go
Never go
My secret surfing' spot is the talk of the school
The Samoan puberty dance all over again.
My secret surfing' spot where only I know
- The gremmies and the hodads never go
- Never go
I said the gremmies and the hodads never go
Yeah, I'm hotdogging on my board till the sun goes down
The mating dance of the whooping crane.
My secret surfing' spot where only I know
- The gremmies and the hodads never go
- Never go
I said the gremmies and the hodads never go
Never go
Absolutely impossible.
I'm hotdogging on my board till the sun goes down
I jump into my woodie and I make it back to town
My secret surfing' spot where only I know
They're now concluding their ceremony.
And they're collapsing exhausted in the sand.
That was great.
By use of the directional audio phonic microphone now,
I shall attempt to pick up some of their more secret yearnings.
Gee, girls are pretty.
- You just found that out, huh?
- Well, I mean when they move.
- Right, Frankie?
- Come on, knock it off, huh?
- What's bugging you, Frank?
- It's Dolores. She racked him up.
Deadhead, you've got the biggest mouth in the world.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Well, he's right. It is Dolores.
Fellows, how would you like to have plans for a girl and end up with a surfboard?
If you're smart, you'll dump her.
- He's right.
- Yeah.
She's not gonna get away with it.
I've been building for this scene all year.
- Then you're gonna dump her?
- Well, I would in a flash.
- Except for one little thing.
- What's that?
- I love her.
- Never say that!
Man, you want to ruin it for the rest of us?
- We'll throw you out the union.
- What am I gonna do? I'm hooked.
Look, you're been building all year for this scene, right?
- Okay, so you build someplace else, huh?
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah. Put her down.
- Right.
You know what happens when a chick knows you dig her?
What?
- She walks all over you.
- Yeah!
Well, I'll show.
I'll dig somebody else.
- Another chick?
- If I were Dolores, I wouldn't like that.
That's the point, goo-goo. Put her down.
But who? Who can I...
- Hey, is she still there?
- Who?
The one at
Big Daddy's, you know.
- The cream puff.
- You mean, Ava.
- Yeah, Ava.
- Man, she's something else.
She's got everything, huh?
Well, I'll tell you, if she hasn't got it, it's only because she hasn't got room for it.
- Big Daddy's tonight.
- You're on!
And now, a poem by our beloved teacher...
Cappy Caplan!
A poem dedicated to Big Daddy!
D is for Dallas.
I may not go there.
A is for, "Ah, ah, ah."
D is for Nicholas.
Long may he wave.
D is for D-Day or maybe Day D.
Y...
- Why not?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Put them all together, the spell Daddy!
He's been a mother to us all.
Yeah. Yeah!
Dance, swing, live, kids.
Remember that tomorrow may be the day after today.
Swing, live, dance.
I will walk among you.
Well, I looked at the heavies
They were rolling' in fast
I knew I'd better make it
'cause they just don't last
I'm surfing'
Surfing'
Swinging and surfing'
Oh, the sand and the sea is the only life for me
I'm surfing'
Yeah, and I'm surfing'
I'm hotdogging on my board
Gonna have me a ball
Caught a good ride and that was all
I'm surfing'
Surfing' and a-surfing'
Oh, the sand and the sea is the only life for me
Just surfing'
Yeah, just surfing'
Well, I looked at the beach
There was nothin' but chicks
Rode a breaker in
Gonna get my kicks
I'm surfing'
Surfing' and a-surfing'
Oh, the sand and the sea is the only life for me

Yeah, and I'm surfing'
Just surfing'
I met a little blonde and I asked her if I could date her
She said, "Come on, honey
You can wash your board later"
I'm surfing'
Surfing' and a-surfing'
Oh, the sand and the sea is the only life for me
I'm a-surfing'
Yes, just surfing'
Yeah, surfing', baby
Just a-surfing'
Oh, the sand and the sea is the only life for me
I'm surfing'
Just surfing'
Surfing'
Come on, I'm surfing'
Well, I'm surfing'
Well, I'm surfing'
- There she is. What do you think?
- Hey, man.
- Yeah!
- Yeah, she's some chick, huh?
Yeah!
- Is this what you wanted?
- It sure is.
- I'm sorry!
- Here. I'll help you with that.
Oh, would you?
I always spill things.
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah!
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
Say, listen, maybe when you take a break, we could kind of dance a little, huh?
Oh yes.
I break very soon.
Well, here. Let me take you tray.
I'll take this for you here.
You done it again, boss.
You stupid.
You stupid.
Fix it.
MICE - RATS
Just what we needed, the black plague.
Out!
Out!
Hold this.
Any moment I shall try for my first contact. This is always difficult.
- Hey, Dad.
- I thought maybe you'd skip us this year.
I like you. And when Eric Von Zipper likes somebody, they stay liked.
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
- Yeah, and I like it here.
- He likes it here.
- He likes it here.
You see, I told you.
I like it here.
- I get the message.
- Yeah.
Look, just don't make any trouble, huh?
Who me?
Aggressive. Definite aggression.
Something's about to...
Definite jungle reversion.
Well-executed, too.
Keep a-moving' and a-grooving'
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Keep a-jumping' and a-stomping'
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Whoa, baby, when you shake so fine
I get the fits and chills up my spine
What you're doing' is getting' to me
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Wind up and let it go now
Don't hold back
Don't hold back
Wind up and let it go now
Don't hold back
Don't hold back
Whoa, baby, when you shake so wild
You make me feel like a motherless child
What you're doing' is getting' to me
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Little girl, I can tell by that look in your eye
You got a kind of pleasure making' my temperature rise
Let me tell you now
That's all right with me.
Long as you never let it drop a single degree
Keep a-saying' what you're saying'
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Yeah, keep a-saying' what you're saying'
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Whoa, each time you twist your hips
Somethin' inside goes a- flippety flip
What you're doing' is getting' to me
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Little girl, I can tell by that look in your eye
You get a kind of pleasure making' my temperature rise
Let me tell you now
That's all right with me

Don't stop now
- Hey.
- Oh. Oh, please, excuse me.
What's the matter, baby?
You got a problem?
Yeah, that oversexed maniac with that girl.
- Well, don't think about him no more.
- What?
- Eric Von Zipper likes you.
- Who's that?
Me!
- Well, you've done it again, boss.
- You stupid.
I'd better go now.
Hey, baby. Girls fall for
Eric Von Zipper.
- I didn't fall. I tripped.
- Tripped, schmipped.
What's the difference?
You're here, and you look good to me.
Yeah, I'm here with friends.
Yeah, well, he found a new chick.
- You'd better let me go.
- Hey! I like you.
And whatever Eric Von Zipper wants, he gets.
No! No! Don't!
Excuse me. Excuse me?
I'm R.O. Sutwell. I'm sorry to intrude, but you're molesting this young lady.
What are you, her grandfather?
To be perfectly factual,
I've really never met her.
Now, if you'll be so kind as to unwrap her.
Look, nobody tells
Eric Von Zipper nothing.
Yeah, that's right.
No one tells Eric Von Zipper nothing.
- Couldn't... Who are you?
- J.D.
That's short for juvenile delinquent.
One moment. Before you do something you may regret,
I think it only fair to caution you that I practice... a most potent oriental physic-psycho philosophy.
Yeah, and he looks like one, too.
Well, I'm gonna give you something new to practice.
- Wait just a moment...
- Like pain.
Excuse me. Would you hold this for just...
I'll have to send for another one of these.
Could you hold these parts for me?
Hold these, too, please, will you?
And watch the battery.
They're very hot. Be careful.
I don't think they manufacture this model...
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, I'm gonna rip you for that.
The Himalayan time suspensions technique.
I think it would be...
Hey, what'd you do to him?
It's very simple. A complex pressure point and applied force.
You see? Now he's in the clutches of what we call time suspension.
Hey, boss?
You're fantastic.
Just wonderful!
Thank you very kindly.
May I escort you home?
Thank you.
I appreciate so much your holding those parts for me.
Thank you. They're very precious to me.
- Hey...
- The battery, yes.
But, listen.
What about him?
Oh, yes. Fortunately, the force was light.
He'll come around in a few hours.
Just keep him warm and comfortable.
My dear.
Dolores.
Where do you think you're going?
I'm being escorted home by this nice, old gentleman.
- Okay!
- A-OK!
He done it with his finger.
One lousy finger. Zap!
And look at him.
He don't even move. No nothing.
- He said he slipped a clutch or something.
- And he's in time suspenders.
I don't care what he's wearing.
Get this stiff out of here. Out!
Hey, gently! Gently!
Don't break him.
Careful.
I just can't get over how great you were.
I mean, the way you saved me from that storm trooper.
That was nothing, Dolores, nothing.
But thank you. Thank you just the same.
Oh, say, you don't mind my calling you Dolores, do you?
Oh, not at all, if I can call you...
What is your name?
- Sutwell. Robert Orwell Sutwell.
- Orwell?
Yes, I'm sorry. That's always been sort of a problem with me.
- I'll just call you Robert, okay?
- A-OK.
Dolores, I've got to confess something to you.
You've suddenly become very important to me.
And I'm interested in finding out more about you.
- Oh?
- You see, I'm an explorer.
I explore.
You understand?
Yes, I understand.
You're my first contact.
Really? At your age?
Yes, and to a man of my age, first contacts are terribly important.
I know. Contact's the most important thing... in the whole world.
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.
- You wouldn't?
- No.
You're so right. I guess old men always seem to know so much more.
I don't know. We old codgers make mistakes, too, you know.
- Not very often, I'll bet.
- Well...
You're so distinguished.
- And you study people.
- Yes, that I do.
Are you a doctor, like Dr. Shootser?
- Well, when I... Dr. Shootser?
- Yes.
Wait a minute.
Don't you mean Dr. Schweitzer?
Is that his name?
Yes. I think he's still using it. You see...
- And you're so exciting.
- You think so?
- You're not at all like...
- Like Frankie?
You'd like Frankie to think of you... as something more than a mere girl?
Wouldn't you?
That's right.
You'd like him to consider you as a wife.
- That's exactly what I said to Rhonda.
- I know.
I mean, I knew that that's the way you'd feel about it
Dolores, now that we've met and sort gotten together...
Well, I guess you could say that we've made contact.
It's funny that with all you experience that I'd be your first contact.
Yes...
- May I say something to you?
- Oh, yes, please do.
You may be my first contact, too.
Dolores, dear, could we just go past contact for a moment?
It isn't contact I want so much as your help.
- Me help you?
- Yes, with my research.
You see, I want to find out all about you.
How you live, where you live, your friends, what you like to do.
Anything you want, Robert.
Now, now, somehow I don't seem to...
You know, I think it, would be better if we talk this over at my place.
- All right.
- You mean you will?
Yes.
Tomorrow then.
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, say about noon?
Oh, Robert, you even know when a girl shouldn't be rushed.
Dolores...
Now, steady, old man.
You have the age but not the experience.
"You even know when a girl shouldn't be rushed.".
Who said old?
- Gee, what do you think of that?
- I think he ought to grow a beard.
- Deadhead, you've got a flabby mouth.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I didn't say nothing.
Boy, this has been some night.
You can say that again.
Boy, this has been some night.
Professor!
Oh, yes! Oh, yes, Marianne!
I'll be there in just a moment.
Just a second.
Hurry!
Oh, yes.
I'm sorry.
There's your old Fitzhampton and Murchison and...
- Thank you.
- ...Jacobson.
Thank you.
My, you've done this swiftly, Marianne.
Marianne, would you believe that last night I made contact?
From the looks of your eyes,
I would believe it.
Imagine. Contact in just two days.
Marianne, incidentally,
I want to ask you something.
Would you say that
I'm an old man?
- Older than what?
- Well, older than young.
Do you know what you're talking about?
- You know you're a very pretty woman.
- You're not bad yourself.
Thank you.
In a bearded, academic sort of way.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
You know, all those young people out there, with their squirming tribal dances...
Strange. All the years
I spent in the jungle,
I never took time out to learn to squirm.
You think maybe you missed something?
Maybe not all of it.
But mostly with me, it's been a spectator sport.
I've never really played on one of the teams.
Don't you think it's time that you got off the bench and into the game?
Robert?
Ah, hi, Rob...
There's one of your teammates here for batting practice.
Oh, yes, hello.
Good morning, Dolores.
You asked me to come by tomorrow, so there I am today just like you wanted.
Oh, yes. Dolores, I think it might be well if I got dressed for the beach and met you down there.
All righty. Don't be long.
All righty.
No wonder you feel old.
Marianne, that's my first contact.
It's pure research. It's business!
- Lolita business.
- I'm not the...
Ava, I love you!
Thank you, darling.
Hey, Ava.
- Hi, I look for Frankie.
- He's coming in off the curl.
- You coming surfing tonight?
- If he takes me.
Well, if he doesn't take you, I will.
Frankie.
- Oh, hello, Ava.
- Hi, darling.
What's the matter?
Don't you like me?
Yeah, sure, I like you, honey, but alone, not in front of so many people.
Now, you're going to take me surfing tonight?
Well, I...
I just might.
Come here, baby.
- Tell me you love me.
- Yeah, yeah, I love you.
Where are you going?
What you think you're doing?
- Robert.
- Oh, yes, right here.
Good afternoon or good morning.
No, it's afternoon.
- Something wrong?
- Oh, no, there's nothing...
Where did you get those banana boats?
Oh, yes. I'm very proud of these.
I brought them back from Africa.
How'd you get them away from the witch doctor?
No, no. They weren't his.
They belonged to the Chief.
- Robert, they've got to go.
- Do you think so?
Well, all right.
They're very comfortable.
- What is this?
- Oh, yes. I'm very proud of this too.
This was present to me by another chief, the Chief of the
Tokyo Fire Department.
The firemen wear them to fires.
It's fireproof, also waterproof.
It's sort of a conversation piece.
No one around here converses in the Japanese firehouse talk, so take it off.
All right.
A bathing suit?
Yes, I've had it for quite a while.
It was presented to me by the Hong Kong YMCA.
- With a skirt?
- Yes, that's part of it.
I'm afraid that's going to have to go, too.
No, no, no, I'm afraid this will have to stay. This is it.
- Well, maybe you could...
- Maybe I could, but I'm not going to.
I'm just fine as I am.
Thank you very much.
Well, in that case, here.
Put this back on.
Very well.
My... I'm terribly sorry.
Oh, no. Actually, I think you're kind of cute.
Sort of a walking United Nations.
Thank you very much.
You know Dolores,
I don't get to the beach very often, so I really wasn't prepared.
What does she see in old beaver puss anyway?
I don't know. If he had a twin, he'd make a good cough drop.
- You get what you pay for.
- Deal!
Hey, pops!
Where'd you get that crazy kimono?
It just so happens it was presented to him by the Chief of the Tokyo Fire Department.
Wonderful! If my rickshaw ever catches fire, I'll know who to call!
Come on.
- Isn't it a hooting day?
- Yes, is it...
A hooting day?
- The sets are so glassy.
- The sets are glassy?
- The waves! They're just like glass.
- Oh, I see.
Tell me something?
Hooting?
Now, as I see it, it means a sort of a cry of pleasure from the word "to hoot"?
Oh, yeah, Robert,
You´re so intelligent.
Hey, come on.
Let's skeg him.
I think you're just perfect.
Hooting, hooting.
- What about Dolores? She likes him.
- She's Frankie's girl. Come on.
- And stoked? Now, stoked means happy?
- Right.
Hi, Dolores, we thought maybe we'd like to meet your friend.
- Not now, Ken.
- Stoked to meet you.
- You talk like a real kook.
- Thank you. You're very kind.
Robert, I think we'd better go to the house.
How are you on the board, beard?
I can do a swan dive and a fairly goof jackknife.
- No, no, no. The surfboard.
- Oh, that, no. I've never done that.
Must be fascinating. I'd like to learn.
It seems fairly simple.
Oh, it is, it is.
How about right now, huh?
- Hooting! Hooting!
- Oh, no, Robert, no!
We'll just try it right here first.
Right there. Just lay right down there.
That's the first step.
I see.
That's it. Right on your face, and paddle like this.
What, like this?
- You see that wave out there?
- Oh, yes.
Okay, now, you sneak into it.
The first thing you know, you're up on your knees.
- Like this?
- That's it, that's it.
Now you're to shoot that wave...
You're building to it.
- Shoot it?
- Yeah, catch it.
- Oh, catch.
- Right. And you stand up.
- Nothing to it.
- That's great!
- He's a real hotdogger.
- Say, do you...
Hotdogger?
- A good surfer.
- Oh, really? Thank you.
- You ride it right in.
- Yes, ride it right in.
- What do you say we give it a try?
- You know he doesn't know how.
- Now, now, please.
- Robert.
It's very, very simple, Dolores.
All right, I'll go right...
Don't you think you'd better take off some of your equipment?
Oh, yes. Thank you very much.
My Perkins reminder watch.
Would you hold this please, Dolores?
Oh, and my glasses.
There we are.
I guess I better take this off, too.
Oh, boy, they just don't make those bathing suits like they used so.
No, no, I'm very attached to this one.
I wore it when I swam the Hellespont.
I like it. I think it's substantial looking.
Thank you, my dear.
All right.
Say, beard, you're gonna need this... when you jazz the glass.
Jazz the glass?
Oh, that's very good.
- You got that?
- Yes, I've got it. Thank you.
Robert, don't!
Now, now, now, please. I told you,
I think is very simple, Dolores.
Wait a moment.
Wait a moment.
I'd like to do a few calculations if you don't mind.
Let see me. The standard sea level pressure is 29.92.
Ought to be 30 inches to the...
Oh, what is the weight of the board?
Twenty-six pounds.
Twenty-six. Thank you very much.
Twenty-six...
That's 2.6, averaged over X, times the natural buoyancy.
Now, all submerged, it's 43.
Let's see here. Saltwater.
Saltwater is 7.2 over 0.4.
Yes.
There we are.
I'm ready.
Oh, no wonder.
I forgot to carry the two.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- Go away. We're closed.
- Zen?
- No, I'm asleep.
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.
Wait a minute. Hey, I know you.
You're the guy who put the finger... on Von Zipper.
I've been trying to figure you out for a long time.
Come on. Squat. Sit down.
What's your racket?
- My name is Sutwell. R. O. Sutwell.
- R. O.
And I'm here to ask questions.
- You're a cop?
- No.
Don't worry about them.
They're asleep.
No, you see,
I'm a developmental biologist, social anthropologist and an explorer.
- You're joshing.
- No, I'm doing research... on post-adolescent surf dwellers.
I'm writing a book.
- It's called "The Sutwell Report.
- How about that?
I'm studying rather primitive behavior patterns.
You came to the right cat.
If there's anything you want to know about these kids
I can tell you the whole thing in two words.
- They're nuts.
- They're nuts?
You see?
You noticed it, too.
What do you think they do all day?
Run all around the beach.
And they only got one thing on their mind.
Each other.
That's sort of usual, isn't it?
That starts in...
I know, but they got so much energy.
They don't know what to do with it.
- They need a reason, a cause.
- A cause?
Yeah, that's why I hired him.
Big Daddy. He'll give them the reason.
He'll give them the cause.
- What cause? He's asleep.
- So he'll give them a sleepy cause.
What's the difference?
He's a real weirdo. I found him on the beach one day walking around.
He had a couple of pigeons or seagulls on his shoulders.
All these kids were gathered around him, waiting to hear the word.
- What word?
- We don't know yet.
You know, you're a very remarkable fellow.
- I think so. I like you, too, Professor.
- Thank you.
- Hey, one thing. Will you level with me?
- All right.
What's with the duster?
You think it moves the chicks?
No, as a matter of fact, it usually works the other way.
I don't dig.
You don't want to level with me, right?
Yeah, all right, I'll level with you.
I was the youngest professor at the university.
In fact, I was so young it was sickening.
Every time I opened my mouth, my students laughed.
The other professors laughed.
Even the janitors laughed.
Well. I knew it couldn't go on for long, so one date at lunch,
I presented my problem to an old professor friend of mine.
And without even glancing up from his soup, he said,
"Buy yourself a pair of glasses and grow a beard. "
So, you see, all of this is just 18 years of professor window dressing.
Amazing how our lives parallel.
I mean, you got the... And...
- You know how I happened to raise this?
- No. Why?
I got a dimple in my chin, and I didn't want anybody mistaking me for Kirk Douglas.
But you don't look anything like Kirk Douglas.
Yeah, you see?
Cappy, any help you can give me with my research will be deeply appreciated.
Well, you're going to need more help than with your research.
Somehow I don't dig.
It's that Eric Von Zipper.
He's looking for you.
He's mad, real mad.
Whoops, there she goes.
I better go over and wake those girls up before they freeze like that.
It once took me three weeks to unwind one of them.
There goes the other one.
All right, come on, girls.
Up, up, everybody up.
Well, I guess I'll just have to turn them over.
They sleep better on their head.
Come on, come on, up.
Thank you, Cappy.
I want to talk to you about Dolores.
- I'm Frankie.
- Oh, yes.
- I know who you are.
- You do?
You're the guy who's been cutting in on my time.
Now, please. Just a moment...
You're brainwashing her with your beard.
Brainwashing her with my beard?
Why else would she be crazy about someone like you?
- Now, that I resent...
- I mean, you're an old man.
Now, just a moment.
If you're so wild about Dolores, why are you running around with this Hungarian goulash?
Because she's my girl!
- Who, goulash?
- No, Dolores.
Oh, I see. Yes.
Make her jealous. Put her down.
Typical aborigine attitude.
I suppose you'd like to drag her off on your surfboard by the roots of her hair?
Yes, I would.
I love her.
Look, I know how you can love her, too, because she's lovable.
But I'm telling you this. I'm not going to let any overage, fuzzy face take away my girl, not if I have anything to do with it.
And believe me, mister, I do!
By the way, how you fixed for blades?
Boy, that kid's really got a chip on his shoulders. I think it's his head.
- Can I ask you something, Professor?
- Yes.
You studying these kids' sex life, or are you getting involved in it?
See you.
Involved.
- Hi, Sue. Have you seen Dolores?
- Dolores who?
Dolores Del Rio. Now, come on!
Where is she?
Help yourself.
- Oh, it's you.
- Yeah, me.
Well, there's nothing we have to say to each other.
Yes, there is. Plenty.
Now, look, this time has gone on long enough.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, come off it! You and old pig bristles...
It just so happens I love him, pig bristles and all.
Have you gone right out of your mind?
Maybe, but I'm not crazy enough to stick with you.
- Not even if I loved you?
- Not even if...
What did you say?
Not even if I loved you?
- Do you, Frankie?
- You know I do.
But you never said it like that.
Oh, honey.
What is going on which
I am included out?
Ava.
- There's something I have to tell you.
- Tell me outside in the dark.
- No, Ava, you've the wrong idea.
- Frankie, you promised.
- "Frankie, you promised."
- Dolores, I was just...
- I'm waiting.
- She's "waiting."
- But, look... What I'm trying to say is...
- I want to hear you say it again.
- Say what, Ava?
- How he loves me.
Did I say that?
Dee Dee, I was only trying to...
Where'd I go wrong?
Ava will kiss and make it feel better.
You bet she will.
Come on. Let's go.
Where did I go wrong?
Treat him nicely.
That's right!
Well, maybe.
Treat him nicely
That's what you should do
I was such a fool to treat him so cruel
He found someone new
Treat him gently
And to him be true
I was so unwise
Told him little lies
I lost him to you
So I ask you to
always take care of him
Maybe it's because I know
I still love him
Treat him nicely
With his love be kind
Had a listened to advice I'm giving you
He might still be mine
Had a listened to advice I'm giving you
He might still be mine
Had I listened to advice I'm giving you
He might still be mine
Professor?
Professor?
Yes, Marianne, I'm dressing.
I'll be right there.
Don't bother.
I'm just lugging in the rest of your library.
Oh, I see.
Still upset with me?
Upset?
Why should I be upset?
Oh, I don't know.
I got that impression.
By the way, how did the game go last night?
- Any home runs?
- No, but it wasn't exactly a shutout.
I went shopping today.
How do I look?
- Like a South Sea island village.
- Oh, thanks.
- Waiting for the volcano to erupt.
- Yes, that's a dramatic image.
- It sort of blends with your beard.
- Tell me, what is this with my beard?
I've heard more about my beard in the last two days... than in all the years since I grew it.
Maybe this tribe is more hip than the Hari I knew of Japan.
I swear... Oh, hey, speaking of tribes,
I'm gonna mingle tonight and get the inner workings of this tribe.
Now, I want you to follow me with the directional here and get it all down on tape.
- I'll get all the good stuff.
- You know, I'm really enjoying this.
Scratch you later, chick.
"Dig" you later.
Dig. Oh, yes, yes.
Yes, I must work on that.
Well, I looked at the heavies
They were rolling' in fast
I knew I'd better make it
'cause they just don't last
I'm surfing'
Yeah, swinging' and surfing'
Hello.
Robert, I thought you'd never get here.
Well, if it isn't King Kamehameha.
Hooting, hooting.
Who gave you the hat?
Lily Dache?
No, no, no. I bought this especially for tonight.
Yeah. I want to be one of the gang.
It's part of my research.
- Robert, I love being your guinea pig.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.
Old pig bristles.
Don't you worry about him.
No.
Put your arms around me.
- What's the matter? You cold?
- Yes.
Well, say maybe I could put some more wood on the fire.
- You would.
- What?
More wood on the fire.
That's strange,
I'm not the least bit cold.
As a matter of fact, it seems very toasty here to me.
- Robert!
- What's the matter?
- Your hat?
- What's the matter with it?
- It's on fire!
- What?
Here, pops!
You may catch cold.
- We're all here
- Yeah, we're here
The time has come
The tide is out
Yeah
- So what do we do?
- We keep warm
- How do we do that, brothers?
- We hold tight
- What do we hold sinners?
- Girls!
Yeah!
Where have they all gone?
If you don't know that, you must've flunked biology.
Come on. Let's go.
This is nice, isn't it?
Robert, you know I like you very much.
- I like you, too.
- Thank you.
But I just can't stand by... and listen to what they're saying about you behind your back.
What are they saying?
They're calling you awful things like "Hair Mattress",
"Old Billy Goat," "Pig Bristles" and "The Finger."
"The Finger"?
Robert, the whole thing, it's got to go.
It won't take long, and you'll hardly feel it.
- Look, I've brought Deadhead's razor.
- Dolores...
You're not suggesting
I cut my throat?
No, silly! This.
Oh, that.
Oh, yes, yes.
No, no, Dolores,
I really shouldn't.
- No, I might not look too good under here.
- I'm willing to take the chance.
- Well, I'm not.
- Robert, be courageous like me.
No, you don't understand.
We're old friends.
We've been together for years.
And you can't just mow down an old friend like that.
- It isn't...
- It's a shame, Robert.
- What?
- You have... such young eyes and such an old chin.
Young eyes?
I'll come back after you two have parted.
Dolores...
Dolores, wait a minute,
I really...
The moon
Promise me the moon
And every little star that shines above
The world
Promise me the world
And every dream
I'm dreaming' of
The moon
What would the moonbeam
I don't want the moon
A moonbeam, a moonbeam
Deadhead, how can you be hungry at a time like this?
Man can't live by love alone.
The world
I don't want the world
To own a real dream
- But please
- Promise me anything
Give me love
- Cool it, Ava. Now, just... Wait!
- Oh, come on!
You promised!
- Now, just one second.
- Come on, darling, don't tease me.
- Ava, down, girl. No, just... No, no, wait.
- Baby, come on.
Robert, Robert.
Robert?
Robert.
Robert, I am so disappointed in you
Don't you have...
Robert? Robert, you look positively...
Robert...
May I call you Bob?
- Why not?
- You know something?
You're whole new you.
- Only on the outside.
- I just can't resist you now.
Bob, it's no use.
I'm yours.
- No, Dolores.
- Bob, are you afraid to be alone with me?
No, no, it's not that.
It's just that...
I just don't trust myself, now that I have my pig bristles gone.
Good! Them let's go someplace where we can be alone. Let's fly to the moon.
Dolores, could you help me with my research now?
- I have lots of questions to ask.
- Just anything, Bob.
Now, surf dwellers.
Tell me, what´s is this irresistible magnet... that draws and holds this tribe here to the beach?
Well, it's fascinating. It's exciting.
The mystery of it all.
And the little unexplained things.
Like, just the other night, a fisherman saw a little ghost plane with blue lights land right here on the beach.
And when they went to investigate, the plane had just disappeared.
Like magic.
Real spooky.
You know, we might blast off in that little ghost plane... with the blue lights even though they're red and green.
You see, Bob?
Now with your pig bristles gone,... even you are beginning to feel the thrill of the beach.
Come on. Let's go find the little blue lights and fly to the moon.
- Bob. it is an airplane!
- Yes, it is.
Oh, Bob, I've never been in an airplane!
Could we go for a ride?
Quiet, quiet, please.
All right. I'll take you.
But it'll have to be in the middle of the night when the beach is deserted.
Now, promise me something.
You won't breathe a word of this to a soul.
- My lips are sealed.
- Good. Just keep them that way.
I'll tell you what.
You go home and get some sleep... and meet me back here at 3:00 in the morning.
- Bob.
- Yes?
You're just the coolest coolest.
I never been so insulted in my life!
Hey, what...
Oh, it's you, Ava.
I thought you were with Frankie.
I was.
- Well, what'd he do?
- Nothing. That's the trouble.
Maybe he was hungry, too.
Marianne.
Marianne, come take a look.
I've shaved...
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH
Marianne, jealous.
Well, why not?
I'm a whole new me.
- Which one is it?
- It's one of them there.
You're a big help.
Hey, what's that?
Looks like a chick.
I could see that, you stupid.
Let's go.
Oh, it's you.
Yeah. Yeah, it's me, Von...
And what you doing here?
It's a secret. We got a surprise for that Sutwell guy.
- I love secrets.
- Oh, yeah?
We'll tell you all about it as soon as we give it to him.
Which one of these is he in?
I don't know.
I'm stranger in this country, too.
- Are you alone?
- Yeah. I'm looking for someone.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Come on, Zipper.
Let's go get him.
Yeah.
Stick around, chick.
You'll see Von Zipper in action.
All right, I stick around.
Now, listen. The only thing you gotta watch for are this fingers.
Now, he's only got two of them, one there and one here.
Now, there are seven of us and only two of them.
You and you each grab a finger, and then I'll hit him.
- Got it?
- Yeah!
You stupids!
But which house is it?
You stupid.
That one.
Let's go. Will you...
Will you...
You stupids!
I can't see nothing!
- Don't holler!
- Help!
- You're hitting me!
- Help!
Dolores.
Help!
Hey! Do you hear a scream?
It's just Dolores and that man.
Help!
- Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me, please.
- Help me!
What's...
Zipper! It's the finger!
Let's get out of here!
You...
- Quit! Quit! I'm going!
- Get out of here!
Oh, I'm terribly sorry I...
You all right?
Here, I'll help you.
There we are. That's it.
No, no. No, this way.
Yes.
- Oh, Bob.
- Dolores.
- What happened?
- I've been so frightened.
- What?
- I don't believe it.
We... I mean, she...
- Frankie...
- They...
They seemed a little restless,
Frankie and the rest of them.
They didn't seem to believe that I was saving you from that...
You mean that carbon-monoxide commando?
Yeah, that's the fellow.
They seem to think that it wasn't just an accident.
How'd you learn to fly?
Oh, I don't know. They lifted me out of my wheelchair into a Cub, and somehow I made it.
- That was before the war, of course.
- Which one?
Spanish-American.
Oh, you're teasing.
I'll bet it was World War I.
You know...
You know, Dolores, incredible as it may seem to you, it was a World war II, and I was an instructor of combat aerobatics.
What does that mean?
Well, that-s the art of getting the opponent off your tail... without being shot down.
Could you show me how it works right now?
Yes. Yes, I could.
What was that?
Oh, that was just primary stuff.
A simple loop. Did you like it?
It was simple enough, I guess.
- Did you enjoy it?
- I loved it.
But before you do it again, let's get an opinion from my stomach.
- You know, when... Your stomach?
- Yeah.
- I'm terribly, terribly sorry.
- That's all right.
The analgesic for your stomach is the Chinese Eight.
- Bob?
- Yes?
- You all right?
- Sure.
Isn't this a sensational curriculum though?
It was designed for the Air Force by a friend of mine, Colonel Wyatt Johnson.
Are you sure it wasn't Wyatt Earp?
Isn't this a great little plane?
It'll do anything.
Will it land? That'd be fun.
You don't want land.
You don't...
Oh, yes, I guess you do.
Right away, Dolores.
Right away.
There we are.
- You're all right?
- Oh, I'm fine.
Oh, no. Look, I'd better help you home.
No, no, there are times when one must be alone.
Will I see you tomorrow?
Only if they allow me visitors.
Oh, fine. Blasting off to the moon.
Sitting on a bed. A likely story.
Marianne, I tell you, it's not my fault.
I didn't plan it this way. It just happened.
Just because you no longer look like Father Time, don't get ideas.
- It's later than you think.
- Listen, you've gotta help me.
I've got a problem.
- You're so right.
- Dolores thinks she's in love with me.
Your problem is you're too young for her, mentally.
Look... Oh, Marianne.
You criticized Fitzhampton for going native.
Look at that outfit.
What's wrong with it?
It's part of my research.
Marianne, look, please help me.
Look, if I can make her believe that there's something...
- between you and me then I could...
- Use me.
If you want a pinch hitter, call Mickey Mantle.
Oh, please, don't put it that way.
That sounds so uncouth.
Just like you've always done.
"Save me from the aborigines. Help me with this report, with that report. "
I'm...
I don't know why I've stuck with you all these years.
You're never even noticed that...
That I've... been around.
Oh, hello. Hello, Dolores.
Sit down. Relax.
I'll be right with you.
You beast!
Beast? Oh, you mean this.
Please don't let this worry you.
Marianne's very understanding.
- I'm sure you are, too.
- Understanding? Bob, what do you mean?
Well, I mean, after all the years that we...
Well, naturally, you didn't think that...
We're very cosmopolitan.
You know.
You shave off a red beard and become a bluebeard!
- I think she's gone.
- I think it worked fine.
- Professor? Professor?
- Please, call me Bob.
Bob.
- You could stop now.
- I could.
You know, I've suddenly discovered something.
- You have?
- Yes. I... I'll tell you later.
Oh, the rocking' goony bird is seldom ever heard
Even in the reaches of his jungle home
The beast! He's a beast.
Dee Dee, what's the matter?
Don't you dig Father Time without his pig bristles?
Shut up! Can't you see she's had a traumatic experience?
I think it's about time that somebody gave that hairless Chihuahua...
- a little trauma of his own.
- Yeah!
- Come on!
- Let's go.
- Hey, where you going?
- Over there.
- I'm going with you!
- Can I go?
You stay here.
After I've finished with him,
I'm coming back to
Seattle with you!
- I wanna talk to you.
- Yeah. Yeah!
- Make it quick. I'm busy.
- Okay. Are you gonna marry her?
- Well, I hadn't really...
- Dolores, I mean!
Dolores?
For heaven's sake, me marry Dolores?
That's right. The ring, minister, ceremony, the whole bit
Who's she?
- She happens to be...
- His girl.
Boy, for an oldie, you really move around.
- He takes vitamins.
- If you...
Hey, Frankie, what's this?
Oh, for heaven's sake, would you stay away from these instruments?
- It's expensive electronic equipment.
- I know what he is. He's a spy!
- A spy?
- What's this?
- Give me that.
- Back off, cowboy.
"The Sutwell Report".
I told you he's a spy.
Well, that accounts for the phony beard.
Oh, for heaven's sake, this is the most ridiculous thing...
- Fellows, listen to this.
- Please...
"And post-adolescent surfing societies are primitive in origin, similar in most ways to pre-civilized..."
Hey, what's that mean?
It means he's using us for case studies.
- Me and Dolores and all of us.
- Yeah?
- He's putting us down.
- Yeah!
"And as to their sexual activities it seems..."
Hey, I'm not finished!
Hey, they're gone. Give me that.
Come on. Let's go!
Pies and beer.
Pies and beer.
I like it.
Go away.
Leave us alone, will you?
Cappy, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Cappy...
What's going on here?
Listen, is there anyplace that you can hide us?
- Who are you?
- Sutwell. R. O. Sutwell, remember?
- Old pig bristles?
- I came...
Yeah. What'd you do with the face mop?
- He's in disguise.
- Marianne, please!
Cappy, I'm in trouble.
Big, big trouble.
That figures. You probably got involved with that Dolores Chick.
- We want Sutwell.
- Marianne, I... What's that?
Look, hide us. Put us in...
Now I know how
General Custer felt.
Now, here he comes.
Singing Bull.
Blast off.
So this is what you think of us, huh?
Yes, it is!
And if I ever get a chance to finish it, it'll be an unusual scientific achievement.
You used us.
You used all of us!
You made Dolores fall in love with you for an experiment.
Oh, for heaven's sake, this little girl doesn't love me!
She was pretending to make you jealous, right?
That's right, Frankie.
I tried to tell you that.
Gee, I don't know what you're all so upset about.
You were doing the same thing with that Hungarian goulash over there.
You know what you need?
You need a leader.
- Somebody to show you the way.
- Way to do what?
- If you...
- Shut up, goo-goo.
Yeah, shut up, goo...
And what's more...
There ain't no more.
Eric Von Zipper said he'd be back.
He's back.
With an army.
- All right, where is he?
- He who?
You know I'm talking about.
Where is he?
- I don't know.
- What, what, what?
- That's him.
- That's him? You stupid!
- The brush is gone.
- The...
You know, I liked him better with the jaw warmer.
Don't you get this?
This is the Samson bit.
Without the hair, he ain't nothing.
Dick!
Hey, let me through!
Ring around the rosy
Keep Professor cozy
We will break your nosey

Charge!
But watch the fingers.
Look, kids, take it easy, will you?
Take easy! Big Daddy hasn't given us the word yet.
Onward. Onward!
Told you to watch the fingers.
My hero.
Yeah.
That does it.
Oh, you...
Professor!
Onward!
Onward?
- I like your style.
- Thank you. Look out!
- You stupid.
- I'm sorry.
I got an army of stupids.
This way, folks.
Just step right this way, please.
Now we have Big Daddy's.
A favorite spot of the teenagers to gather and have fun, good, clean fun.
Of course, there's a teahouse across the street...
Be gentle.
Who do you think you're playing with? Kids?
My army.
Look, wreck the joint if you wanna, but whatever you do, watch out for Big Daddy!
Look out!
Give me one of those pies!
Honey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
Honey, I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Listen to me, honey. I didn't mean it.
- Too late.
- I'm sorry.
Too late for what?
Sluggish nervous system.
Professor?
Yes, Mr. Von Zipper?
I wondered if we could talk for a minute.
- Do you mean like a palaver?
- We could do that, too.
All right, Mr. Von Zipper.
- Watch him. You can't trust him.
- Thanks.
Look, professor...
Could we be friends?
Why not?
Look, Professor, now that we're buddies,
I wonder if you could learn me something.
Oh, yes. I know what you want to know.
The Himalayan time suspension technique.
Yeah. Could you teach me that?
It's possible.
Good. Because see, that way,
I wouldn't need a army.
'Cause, anyway, they're, you know...
I thought so.
Yeah, so if you could teach me that, then I couldn't need a army.
I could go around to anybody if I didn't like them and I could take the fingers and press...
Please, may I tell you that
I only teach this to people...
How do you like that?
Big Daddy's waking up!
He's waking up!
He's gonna give us the word!
Well, come on, Big Daddy.
Give us the word.
The pit.
Bring me my pendulum, kiddies.
I feel like swinging.
Well, I looked at the heavies
They were rolling' in fast
I knew I'd better make it
'cause they just don't last
I'm surfing'
Swinging' and a-surfing'
Well, the sand and the sea is the only life for me
I'm surfing'
He still hasn't come out of it.
You know, I kind of like him this way.
- Say it again.
- I love you.
Oh, that sounds so wonderful.
Well, I guess my research is just about finished.
It almost finished both of us.
You know, Marianne, you won't believe this, but my next trip is going to be to the Mariana Islands.
- Oh?
- Yes.
And I'm looking desperately for an assistant.
You are?
Someone who can keep me from getting involved, with the natives, that is.
I think I know someone who could keep you uninvolved... with the natives, that is.
I'll be back.
Just you wait.
Eric Von Zipper will be back!
Hey! Wait for me!
You stupid.

Coffee?
Coffee, Rick?
All right, come on, Peggy. lt'll serve you right if you get burned. lt won't be the first time.
Oh my, aren't we bitter.
That's no way to start your vacation. lt's no vacation.
Oh? No trouble, l hope.
Well, l'm going home to get away from trouble.
Now there's a switch, even for you.
Uh...
Oh, thank you.
What's up, Rick? l got fired.
Oh, l'm sorry.
But, knowing you, you must have brought it on yourself.
Not this time.
You'll find a spot with another airline.
Have you tried United? l've tried them all.
But you're a good pilot.
Well, nobody questions my ability. lt's my reputation.
Nobody will believe l've changed. l know. lt's the girls that stay the same.
Believe it or not, this time, l was innocent. l was sitting there flying, minding my own business when this soft feminine voice came over the intercom and told me there was something smoldering in the galley.
Don't tell me-- she was.
Right.
But l took it straight and l went back to investigate.
And she took advantage of you.
Are you going to tell it, or am l?
All right, so she didn't take advantage of you.
She kissed me.
That doesn't sound too bad.
You never fought it before.
Well, we hit some turbulence and we both wound up on the deck in full view of the passengers.
Well, it makes a good story.
Uh, how about having dinner with me tonight?
Help me forget my troubles.
Uh-uh.
You've been away from the islands too long, skipper. l got over you years ago.
Well, thanks for the sympathetic ear.
Part of the service.
Welcome to paradise,
Hawaiian style.
Hawaii
USA
Hawaii
USA
We're flyin'
Comin' your way
Aloha
Hawaii, USA
Gee, it's great
To be in that 50th state
The land of enchanted dreams
What an isle
Well, it's heaven, tropical style
Where love weaves a spell lt seems
Gee, what fun
Just to swim and surf in the sun
While the trade winds caress
The sea
What a sight
Those exotic scenes of delight
Are waiting for you
And me
Hawaii
USA
Hawaii
USA...
Thanks a lot, Johnny.
Hey, missionary.
Oh, hi, native.
Welcome back to Paradise.
Why didn't you wire me? l'd have been at the ramp with a dozen Wahines. l wanted to surprise you.
You did, you did.
How much vacation time you got? lndefinitely. l got, l got let out of the airlines.
So, what happened this time? What'd you do?
You'd never believe it.
All right, don't tell me.
So what'll you do now, missionary?
Aw, come on, Danny, there hasn't been a missionary in my family for a hundred years.
You know that.
You can take the boy out of the church but you can't keep his hands out of the cookie jar.
Who was the cookie?
All right, she was a stewardess.
But l had nothing to do with it.
All l had on my mind was helping her put out the fire in the galley.
And what was on fire?
She was.
Hey, maybe you can give me a job.
Are you out of your pineapple-pickin' mind? l go for days without even a sniff of a customer and with five kids to feed.
You got five kids?
At last count.
What are you trying to do, sink the island?
Well, l've got this nervous habit...
Well, you better try biting your nails.
Hey, l set some lobster nets out on the reef.
How about a lobster luau?
You haven't seen Betty for a long time.
Well, l'd like to, Danny but l've got to find a job and a place to live.
Tomorrow.
Tonight, you stay with us. ln the morning, you can take my car and go find a job.
-Five kids?
-Yeah.
You got yourself a baby-sitter.
Finish it up, Earl. ls this a picnic, Mama? lt's a welcome home party for Uncle Rick.
Now watch your step. l have the biggest watermelon!
No, l do.
Now, now, no fighting.
Now be careful, that's heavy.
Here you go, Rick.
Papaya and liquid oxygen.
What time do l blast off?
You won't know a thing until you're in orbit. lt's the reentry that's rough.
Are you two reminiscing about old times?
We're just talking about Rick's little adventure with a...
Uh, uh... l think the kids would like to hear about my, uh, skin-diving off Malibu.
That would be fun.
Yeah, sit down.
Well, l was down about 50 feet, and l got lost.
And a beautiful mermaid came by and offered me a can of tuna.
Oh, Uncle Rick...
What happened then,
Uncle Rick?
Well, uh, uh... l ate the tuna, see... and, uh, l held my breath and l started swimming and l swam all the way here.
That's why l'm so tired.
But you came in Daddy's car.
We saw you.
Mmm, well, actually, the, uh, the real truth is, uh... l flew from
San Francisco, see and my wings are tired.
But only angels have wings.
And you're no angel, because l heard Daddy say so.
Big mouth.
Why don't you take the kids and go help your mother?
Okay, l'll go.
But don't believe any of his stories, Mommy.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Number-one child's very bright.
They all are. lt's tough to keep up with them.
Yeah, it must be tough to keep track of them.
Ah, you'll find out one of these days.
Him married?
Not a chance.
Marriage and children are for squares like us. l'm glad you're back, Rick. lt gets dull without you around.
You know, no planes being taxied into offices on New Year's Eve, no girls calling at all hours of the night looking for you no irate fathers writing to newspapers...
Yeah, l guess l did burn some bridges behind me.
Well, you can always go back to crop dusting or, or working for the Blackmont outfit. l hear they're looking for someone to pilot their helicopters.
Oh, l'm not that desperate.
Where will you live, Rick? l'll get an apartment in Eva Beach.
Well, there goes that neighborhood.
Oh!
Hey, kids, quiet it down!
We want Queenie!
Maya-maya, where's my papaya?
Boolu-boolu, it's in Honolulu.
Boolu-boolu, it's in Honolulu.
Hey, Uncle Rick, look. l'm Queenie Wahine.
You know, you look like a little queen.
Come on, Uncle Rick, tell us about Queenie Wahine.
Come on, tell us a story!
She sells sea shells, by the seashore
But l know a gal who sells so much more
Queenie Wahine's papaya rates higher
Than pineapple, pumpkin or poi
Please pick her papaya
Put Queenie Wahine in perfect, perpetual joy
Though some peoples' palates prefer pickle salads
Plum pudding, pink popcorn, peach pie
Oh, Queenie's papaya you'll truly desire
When that Queenie Wahine passes by
Queenie Wahine's papaya rates higher
Than pineapple, pumpkin or poi
Please pick her papaya
Put Queenie Wahine in perfect, perpetual joy
Though some people's palates prefer pickle salads
Plum pudding
Pink popcorn
Peach pie
Oh, Queenie's papaya you'll truly desire
When that Queenie Wahine passes by
Queenie Wahine's papaya rates higher
Than pineapple, pumpkin or poi
Please pick her papaya
Put Queenie Wahine in perfect, perpetual joy
Though some people's palates prefer pickle salads
Plum pudding, pink popcorn, peach pie
Oh, Queenie's papaya you'll truly desire
When that Queenie Wahine passes by.
You're fun, Uncle Rick!
You're fun!
Hey, Uncle Rick!
Hey, Danny, you got room for one more?
Sure, hop in.
Mr. Cubberson is in alligator shoes.
Hmm, so l see.
Yes, l certainly am.
And our intention is to see everyone in alligator shoes,
Mister, uh...
Uh, Richards.
Rick Richards.
-Aloha.
-Aloha.
Mr. Cubberson's on his way to the shoe convention on Maui.
Oh, the boys always depend on me for my old keynote address. l mustn't be late and let them down.
They know they can count on Cubberson.
How'd it go? lt's rough out.
That's too bad.
You'll find another spot.
Good commercial pilots are rare.
And so are alligator shoes and that's what we're trying to sell.
Alligator shoes are a symbol of prestige, of wealth, of importance.
Hey, yeah, you're right,
Mr. Cubberson.
Ah, l'm not going back to work for somebody else,
Danny.
Let me take the controls, l want to show you a place l looked at this morning.
Why are we sinking?
Where are the life jackets?
Just a slight detour,
Mr. Cubberson.
No extra charge.
Oh, but l'm late now and l have to make that opening speech.
We'll get you there in plenty of time.
Beautiful, aren't they?
Yeah, but, uh, so are
Mr. Cubberson's alligator shoes.
What am l supposed to be seeing?
'Cause whatever it is, l don't.
Well, l came over to see
Blackmont, like you said but instead of going to work for him we figured out a way to scratch each other's backs. l sold him on going into partnership with us.
He scratches our backs by putting up the choppers we scratch his by putting up the service.
Ah, what kind of service?
A personal air service.
Look, we both know these islands, Danny.
We could use the choppers to fly tourists to places they could never reach by any other means of transportation.
Three passengers at a time?
We couldn't afford it, and neither could the customers.
Why not?
Cubberson has the right idea.
Give the people a little something special and they'll pay for it.
Two choppers would make it pay us.
And all we'd provide is the service.
Well, not exactly.
Blackmont wants us to put up $10,000 bond.
Yeah, l knew there was a catch.
Where do we get that kind of money?
Well, my severance pay and the loan you're going to get on your plane.
And if we can't meet the payments we lose both the choppers and the bond, right?
Ah, yes, but we won't let that happen.
Sorry, old buddy. l love you like a brother, but it's too risky.
Come on,
Cubberson's waiting.
Aloha, aloha!
Aloha!
Gentlemen, l greet you. lt's delightful to be here.
Oh, it's, it's good to be well-liked.
Danny, l'd like you to meet somebody.
We'll see you later,
Mr. Cubberson.
Sure.
Lehua!
Do l know you?
Allow me to introduce myself.
Rick Richards.
This is my buddy, Danny Kohana.
Aren't you a little late?
Late?
We had a date, remember?
Well, how could l forget? When?
For dinner.
June 4, two years ago.
And you've been waiting all this time?
Well, you must be starving.
Not anymore. l ate my heart out for a day or two.
Lehua, l-l know l gave you a bad time but l'm a different guy now.
Any change would be an improvement. l said l was sorry. l'd like to make it up to you.
How about joining us for lunch?
Well, l'm on duty right now.
What time do you have?
Fine. l'll meet you at exactly same time two years from today.
Lehua, l got a proposition for you.
The same one?
We can help each other.
Sorry, we don't provide that service anymore. lf you just listen for a minute.
Look, Danny and l are starting a helicopter line for the tourists.
Hey, wait.
We know these islands better than anybody.
We can take people to places that nobody else can.
And you can help by lining up some passengers for us.
Not me, honey. l been that route.
When you take somebody for a ride it's a long trip.
Uh, chow time? l'm not giving up that easy.
Don't go away.
Lehua, two years ago, l got sent to the mainland. l tried to phone you before l left.
For your cards and letters, l thank you.
Well, l'm not much for writing, but l thought about you a lot. l wish l could believe that. lf you go along with us, l'll prove it to you.
Look, you're the only one that can help us. l'll tell you what.
You scratch my back, and l'll scratch yours.
Make bigger circles.
Mmm, bigger, Rick.
Mr. Kohana!
Mr. Kohana!
Shh!
Quick, quick, we've got to get to the plane.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Uh, you've brought me to the wrong convention is what's the matter.
We're even on the wrong island.
Wrong convention?
This is a convention of the SPCA-- the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to...
Alligators.
Oh, quick.
We've got to get out of here.
They're liable to lynch me. l'm supposed to be at the Hanalei Plantation.
But you said the Maui Sheraton.
Well, l'm a stranger around here.
How am l supposed to know where l'm going?
That's the reason l hired you.
No, you.
Okay, Mr. Cubberson.
Let's go.
Yeah, come on.
Hey, that's great. l know another girl at the Hanalei Plantation.
She can do us a lot of good, too.
Spare me, will you,
Rick, buddy?
You're wasting your time.
Don't bet on it.
Come on, come on. l'll talk to you later, Lehua.
Oh... Oh, well, l'm here in plenty of time. l'd like to settle up and buy you boys a drink? l'll take a rain check, Mr. Cubberson.
But don't forget us on your next trip.
Oh, no, l won't. l'll see you later, Danny.
Aren't you forgetting something,
Mr. Cubberson?
Huh?
Oh.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, Rick!
Rick, welcome home! l'm glad to be back, Lani. l thought you were dead, or worse, married.
Well, l had a few crash landings but l managed to walk away.
What's new in your life?
Just an absence of you.
Come on.
Oh, where you taking me?
Down to the Piki Niki. ln case you've forgotten, l work here. ls Charlie running, or do we walk?
Well, he's still temperamental, but let's risk it.
Tell me you came back to see me, Rick.
Go ahead, lie a little.
Well, the truth is l'm trying to start a helicopter service with Danny Kohana.
We could fly people to out-of-the-way places like Moonlight Beach.
Rick, you remembered!
Sure. lt was a long walk, but it was worth it.
Three days of absolute heaven.
When can we go again?
Well, until l get this business started l'm going to be pretty busy, but there is a way.
What's that?
Well, you could recommend our service to the hotel guests, and l can combine work with the pleasure of seeing you.
And l'd be helping you get your business started, right? ln a way like nobody else could.
You scratch my back and l'll scratch yours.
Huh? What about it?
Start scratching.
And here she is, and none too soon--
Hanalei's own Lani Kaimana.
One good turn deserves another
Be my love, l'll be your lover lt's all part of nature's laws
Ooba do-bop, do-bop lf you scratch my back
Ooba do-bop, do-bop
Then l'll scratch yours
Ooba do-bop, a-dooba do-bop lf you'll scratch-a my back
Then l scratch-a your back
Like two peas in a pack
Let's get rid of our itch together
Joy, they say, is in the givin'
Come on, give, make life worth livin'
Your welfare is my concern
Dooba do-bop, do-bop
Do a favor for me
Dooba do-bop, do-bop l'll do one in return
Dooba do-bop, a-dooba, do-bop lf you'll scratch-a my back
Then l'll scratch-a your back
Like two peas in a pack
Let's get rid of our itch together, hmm
Scratch me now, a little lower
What a feeling, do it slower
[ Skipped item nr. 467 ]
Well, l gotta admit
Dooba, do-bop, do-bop
You just hit the spot
Dooba, do-bop, dooba, do-bop lf you'll scratch-a my back
Then l'll scratch-a your back
Like two peas in a pack
Let's get rid of our itch together lf you scratch-a my back
Then l'll scratch-a your back
Like two peas in a pack
Let's get rid of our itch together.
Hey, Danny, Blackmont won't wait much longer. l mean, where would we be if Captain Cook hadn't taken a chance?
You'd probably be in a stew pot and my people would still own the islands.
Look, we're missing a chance of a lifetime. lt could work just great with Lani and Lehua sending us customers and there'll be more.
Okay. l borrowed all the cash l possibly could but l still can't make it without you. l said okay.
And if l don't pay it back, l'll be in hock up to my neck.
That should show how serious l am about this thing.
You said okay? l did.
That means you'll go? l already made up my mind.
Lani called about a couple of firm deals and Lehua called asking about prices. l may be a little pupule, but... shake, partner.
''Danrick.'' Dan, Rick.
Thanks for the billing.
Well, we're in business now.
Hey, but, uh, what's the lineup?
Don't tell me we've got customers already.
Well, uh, not exactly.
We need somebody to mind the place while we're out so l advertised for a Girl Friday.
You sure it's not a little something for Saturday and Sunday?
All right, girls.
Follow me inside and... l'll check out your qualifications. lt's a good thing she doesn't have a portable television.
Where did you put the ad, in ''Playboy''?
This way, girls.
Hi, Danny.
Judy, what are you doing? l told Ben this is the last time l'd rent this plane if he didn't get the rudder cable fixed.
You practicing for the powder-puff derby?
Ha! My mom won that when she was nothing but a bored housewife.
Anyway, l've had it for a while. l'm running too low on cash to rent planes anymore.
Judy, how would you like to work for me?
As a pilot?
A pilot?!
Why not?
Women can set all kinds of records but not one of you will let us make a living flying.
Well, maybe we can talk about that later.
Ever work in an office?
Where do you think l get the money to sink into flying? l've outrun some of the biggest executives in Honolulu!
Did you bring a change of clothes?
Sure. Why?
Don't ask any questions.
Just get cleaned up.
Here. l'll explain it later.
Well, thanks a lot, girls and we'll get in touch with you later on.
Thank you.
Thank you.
-Good-bye.
-Bye.
Well, your qualifications look good.
How's your typing? l hunt and peck.
Yeah, l'll bet you do.
You sit over at my desk and l'll be with you in a minute.
How's your shorthand? l take 180 words per minute. l also operate a tabulating machine translate Hawaiian and Japanese and l'm quite good with a scalp massage.
Yeah, uh, well, you sit right over here and my partner will talk to you in a few minutes.
How are you at answering the phone?
Depends on what l'm doing when you call.
Well, you wait here, and l'll interview you.
Hey, Rick, can l see you out here for a minute?
Don't go away, girls.
Look, you can let them all go. l've hired the perfect girl.
She can type, take shorthand and knows the islands.
Huh... We met before, about two years ago.
On a surfboard.
Really?
Yeah, Waikiki.
You were wiped out.
Remember? l scooped you out of the soup.
Oh, yeah, l remember.
You tried to give me mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
The offer still holds.
Hmm, l'll keep it in mind.
You never gave me your name.
Judy...
Uh, Mrs. Hudson.
Oh. Mrs. Rock Hudson?
Uh, Mrs. Roy Hudson.
Julie's husband's a Navy pilot.
He's out on maneuvers.
Oh. Do you mind if l call you ''Friday''?
Uh, Judy reminds me of a clam shucker.
A clam shucker?
Yeah, it's this girl l used to know. lt was her favorite pastime-- shucking clams.
Would you excuse us, please?
Danny?
Why pick a married one?
So you'd keep your mind on your work.
Ah, you worry too much, Danny. l'm off to forge another link in the Danrick operation.
There's a girl at the
Polynesian Culture Center...
Oh, not another one.
Look, we've got enough gals working for us now to start a modeling agency.
The more girls, the more business. l promise l won't get emotionally involved.
Take the other girls inside, will you?
And get their numbers while you're at it. l'll buy one of my own at the dime store.
Sometimes saying you're married works better than an insect repellent.
Hi, Rick.
Hi.
Please excuse me.
Rick, aloha noe!
Pua, it's been a long time.
Too long. l've missed you.
Where did you get the helicopter? l've just gone into business with Danny Kohana.
Then you're going to stay on the islands?
Once l get the helicopter service going l can spend most of my time here.
Oh, l'm for that!
Can l help?
Like nobody else can.
You scratch my back, and l'll scratch yours.
Sounds good.
Oh, but right now l've got to ride on a canoe. lt's part of the show.
Do you want to come along?
Great! Let's go!
Okay.
Drums of the islands, you're beating in my heart
You're with me no matter where l roam lf ever l wander, if ever we're apart l know that you will lead me home lf l should journey across the deep blue sea l'll never forget these coral shores
Drums of the islands, l hear you calling me
And l'll return forever yours l love each valley, each grain of sand, each hill
The flowers, the music of the isles
These are the things that l love and always will
Though l may roam
10,000 miles
Drums of the islands, you're beating in my heart

Danrick Airways. l'm sorry, he's not here right now.
Yes, l will.
Oh, how's it going?
Danny was looking for you.
He had to leave with a customer.
What's up?
You've got a date with some dogs.
Oh, a change of pace, eh? l meant real ones.
A Mrs. Daisy Barrington chartered our service to take her pets to a dog show in Kauai.
Nobody else would take them uncrated.
She'll meet you at the country club.
We don't haul dogs.
She's willing to pay a great deal.
Oh. We do haul dogs.
Uh, where are they?
You're to pick them up at the Kahala Hilton.
Like right now.
The Kahala Hilton.
That reminds me, l know a girl who works there.
Might be able to help us.
Another clam shucker?
Very funny.
Oh, uh, by the way, how do you like the job? l'd rather be doing what you're doing. l don't think you could take the strain.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Mm. l sure like the way you working girls don't dress. lt's my day off and l can dress any way l like.
Are those your dogs?
Well, it's time for you to go to work.
Hmm. What a way to earn a living. lt's nice of you to come along, Joanna. l want to see what l'm selling.
Thank you.
We'll get them there all right. lf l had my life to live over, l know just what l'd like to be
A pampered pet of a rich brunette
Sittin' on my mama's knee
Someone to love me, someone to care
Rubba-dubba-dub her little fingers through my hair l need a dog's life
What a life
That's good enough for me
That's good enough for me lf l had a bone to be pickin'
A pickin' chicken or a steak
Curled up there in an easy chair
Man, that won't be hard to take l'll always be faithful
That's what l'd be
Never bite the hand that feeds me, no, sirree
Just lead a dog's life
What a life
That's good enough for me
That's good enough for me l'd find me a fifi le poodle
And lose my noodle over her l'd chase her around
All over town
Just to ruffle up her fur
Nuzzle her muzzle, a hole in her paw
Greatest case of puppy lovin' you ever saw lt's called a dog's life
What a life
That's good enough for me
You heard me say it now
That's good enough for me
Yeah.
That's good enough for me.
Ah, behave yourself.
This evening had better be worth what l'm going through back here. l'll buy you the biggest steak you ever had.
Okay, all right, you cats, cool it!
Hey, l'm your friend.
They must be hungry.
Behave yourself.
Ow! You don't eat out much, do you?
Here. You take them and see if you can calm them down.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, get them off me!
Help me!
Help!
Down, boy.
Down, l said. Not up!
Rick!
Rick!
Hey!
He's blocking my view.
Get him off my lap!
Rick, watch what you're doing!
Joanna, hold him back.
Hey, you want to fly it? l can't see! Rick!
Yeah, l see it!
Help!
Oh, my God, help!
Rick, Rick, Rick, stop!
Rick, the car!
Donald!
You, you, you... road hog!
There ought to be a law against such an outrage! l got his number.
This is the day, Ruggles.
The is the big day we've been waiting for.
At last, at last. lt's their first flight without me.
They're growing up.
Oh, Ruggles, l hope to heaven my little ones didn't get airsick.
My babies.
My babies.
My babies!
What have they done to you?!
Look at them.
Just look at them.
How can l ever show them?!
What have you done to my precious babies?!
Well, look what they've done to me.
Shh-shh!
Well, they're just fine, ma'am.
See, we had a little party on the way over... with dancing and music... and doggie yum-yums.
You fed them dog food?
How dare...!
Oh... did that naughty man hurt
Mommy's little sweethearts?
Oh, well, you come on with Mommy.
Mommy take care of you.
Come on, Ruggles.
Come on, baby.
Mommy take care of you. l look a lot worse than they do.
Yeah. How am l going to show you?
By paying for a new hairdo.
And that steak you promised.
Stop it, Andy.
Behave yourself.
You're making me lose my appetite.
Oh, well, l'm improving mine. l was told you were shy and retiring.
You must have been talking to my mother. l'm starved.
All l've had all day were those doggie yum-yums.
My hairdresser almost gave up.
She thought l should be declared a disaster area. l don't know about that.
Stop it! l'll have a thick slice of that one.
Uh, new rules: no dogs, alligators or cats.
Just give us two fillets.
You, uh, lose your wedding ring?
Oh, l always take it off when l bathe.
Oh, you've taken a bath.
Uh, Joanna, this is my secretary, Mrs. Hudson.
Oh, hello.
Hi. Well, it's been nice seeing you.
Come on, Andy.
The table's ready. l haven't ordered my steak yet. l've ordered enough for two-- come on!
Oh, l didn't know your husband was back from maneuvers.
Rick Richards.
Give me a big hunk of that, mac.
Husband?!
Uh, well, this isn't my husband.
He's a friend-- a friend of ours.
Baby, l didn't know you were married. l'm sorry, l've done a terrible thing and l can understand you hating me.
But l don't hate you. l think it's great.
Stop it. l told you, l'm married.
Yeah, l know.
Maybe you better cool it, huh?
Hey, why don't you stick that big nose somewhere else, buster?
Cut it out.
Just chalk it off to experience.
Now, look, l ain't leaving until l get my steak.
Baby, we could have a good time...
Here's your steak... rare!
One of those, huh?
That's my boy.
Dust him off, Rusty.
Duck, Rick!
You... you...!
Joanna!
Get me out of here.
Would you like your steaks put in a doggie bag, sir?
A doggie bag!
After what l've been through?
You're quite a girl, Friday: surfer, pilot, secretary, wife.
Well, yes, sometimes l amaze myself. l'll see you in the morning?
Why not? l haven't been fired, have l?
No, your personal life's your own. l'm sorry l got involved in it tonight.
You can let me off here. lt's only another block.
For the same fare, l could take you all the way.
Good night, Rick.
Uh, maybe l better go and explain to your husband that you had to work late.
Uh, no, thanks.
And that you'll be leaving early on a special assignment.
-For the company?
-Of course.
But maybe it's better if l tell him about it.
No, he wouldn't understand.
He's very jealous.
Well, that didn't bother you earlier.
Which makes me just the kind of girl you like, doesn't it?
Good night.
Aw, come on, you can't be that angry.
Can't l? l was afraid you might not show up this morning but l'm glad you did.
Thank you.
There's still something wrong.
That bugs you, doesn't it?
No, it's just good business.
A single girl sells more tickets. l'll keep it.
Where? lt's a good thing you weren't wearing a charm bracelet.
That's it.
Hold it.
B-But, Mr. Belden are you sure it was one of our helicopters?
Yes, yes, that's right.
Not now, Jan.
Friday?
He did what?!
Mr. Belden, why would anyone be driving down either side of the highway, let alone the wrong side?
Look, Kohana, l'm accustomed to handling complaints filed by others and l hate to make more work for myself and the board but l can not ignore reckless flying and the near-destruction of government property in the form of my assigned automobile not to mention my wife.
Your wife? l hope it wasn't serious.
What happened?
Oh, hi, Uncle Rick!
Oh, hi, Jan. l guess l'm getting too old for that stuff.
No, you got a long way to go,
Jan.
What are you doing here?
Daddy promised me a ride in his helicopter!
Shh...
And then we're going for a swim.
Hmm.
Now there's no point in making a federal case out of it as long as no one was seriously hurt.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, l'll come right over and see if we can't straighten it out.
Yes, sir, right away.
Do you know who that was?
Surprise me.
Donald Belden.
One of the regional directors of the lsland Aviation Bureau.
Where does he want us to fly him?
He's already been given a short trip-- right into an irrigation ditch.
You forced him off the highway with the chopper. l what?!
He says his wife will never be the same.
Are you sure he doesn't want to thank me?
Oh, come on.
This is no time for jokes. l've got to go right over and calm him down before he files a formal complaint.
Look, Danny, l didn't even see him. lt must've happened when the dogs got loose.
You really set some kind of a new record. ln addition to Belden we've had complaints from Mrs. Barrington the Steak House and the
Pineapple Pickers Union.
Oh, boy.
Good news travels fast, doesn't it? l'll see you all later. l got to go bail us out, one at a time.
But Dad, you said you were going to go take me for a ride. l did it, Danny. l'll clear it up.
Let me talk to Belden.
No chance.
You couldn't get near him. l'm sorry, sweetheart.
Maybe later.
You keep an eye on her until l get back.
Come on, honey, l'll teach you how to type your name. l already know that.
Oh, you had two calls.
Business or pleasure? l'm beginning to wonder if there's a difference.
Uh, Joanna wants you to call her and Lani has a honeymoon couple on Kauai who want to come back here to the airport.
Cheer up, Jan.
He'll be back soon.
Why do grownups always think business is so important?
Nothing is more important than you are.
Your daddy just has to straighten out a mess l got us into.
Now what if l take you up?
Would you, Uncle Rick?
Why not?
Right near the hotel on Kauai is a place called the lron Kettle where they have the most beautiful beach and they build the biggest sand castles you ever saw.
How about it?
That sounds great.
Let's go.
That's nice of you, but you think you should?
Sure, why not?
We'll have lunch at Hanalei and then bring the passengers back after that. lt'll be like a real date!
Hmm... my life gets more and more complicated.
Let's go.
And remember: no dogs, alligators or cats.
And you keep off the highways.
Bye, Friday!
Fun, huh? lt's like being inside a big glass bug. l'll teach you how to fly this bug when you're old enough.
Do you really think l could?
Sure, there's nothing to it.
All you have to do is learn how to pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time.
That's great.
Now try blinking one eye.
Now stick out your tongue.
Oh, that's just being silly.
Well, that's what dates are for.
Datin' is a game that grown-ups play
Datin' means actin' in a silly way
Datin' makes the gals start wiggle walkin'
Datin' makes a guy start baby-talkin'
Dizzy like children on a merry-go-round
Grown-ups are the biggest kids l've found
You'd think they'd belong in a baby carriage
They're doin' things that lead to marriage
Now, don't you laugh at what they do, oh, no
'Cause someday you'll be datin', too
Datin' makes a guy comb his hair just right
So his gal can mess it up when they kiss good night
Datin' makes you quarrel and say you'll break up
Just because it's so much fun to make up
Children can't wait to grow up, but then...
They're datin' and they're actin' like kids again
You'd think they'd belong in a baby carriage
But they're doin' things that lead to marriage
Now, don't you laugh at what they do, oh, no
Someday you'll be datin' too
Oh, boy! Sandcastles!
Welcome, Rick.
Thank you.
You've come back to marry my daughter?
Papa, please.
She has royal blood.
On her mother's side?
My ancestors had the right idea. lf a young man didn't want to marry your daughter you dipped him in coconut butter and threw him into a volcano. ln coconut butter?
They use it on everything.
You think it over, Rick. l got some other cooking to do.
Well, uh, l better get back to the hotel.
The honeymooners will be waiting.
Oh, they won't be ready until 4:00.
4:00? That's five hours from now.
Wasn't that the point to our deal-- to spend a little time together? l've got Jan with me.
You can have her back before dark.
We'll leave her here with Papa and go to Moonlight Beach.
No deal. l can't leave Jan. l promised not to let her out of my sight.
All right, but it won't be the same. l'll get my swimsuit and meet you at the 'copter... with three lunches.
Uncle Rick!
Uncle Rick, come help us build a sand castle.
A house of sand is an empty work of art
Oh, you can take a whole lot of sand
And build a castle on the beach
And though you mold it, and you plan
Still you've got nothing in your reach
One little slip and it tumbles down
One wrong step and it crumbles all around
Like a house without love that's sure to fall apart
A house of sand is an empty work of art
A house of sand is an empty work of art
Oh, you can build a tower of clay
But if you ask my advice
Well, it's worthless, l say lt's got no heart, it's cold as ice
One little slip and it tumbles down
One wrong step and it crumbles all around
Like a house without love
That's sure to fall apart
A house of sand is an empty work of art
A house of sand is an empty work of art
A house of sand is an empty work of art.
Oh, it's just beautiful!
Just beautiful!
You sure you're going to make it?
Yeah, l'm sure.
You made it!
Just like a roller-coaster. lt was scary.
Well, what do you say we go for a swim?
Now... last one out of the water is a papaya picker!
Uncle Rick, l don't care if l am a papaya picker.
You're the prettiest little papaya picker l've ever seen.
Boy, this is a neat place. l could stay here forever.
So could l, ''Uncle Rick.''
Uh, we can't stay long. l've got some business to take care of.
Aren't l part of that business?
You're more pleasure than business.
Well, prove it.
There's a third party at this convention, you know.
Well, she could go bird- watching, or something. lt's getting late.
Time to go.
Let's pack up.
Party pooper!
You'd better go wash that sand off.
You all packed?
We're all ready, Rick.
Come on.
Oh, no!
All right, Lani, where is it?
Where is what?
The key.
How would l know?
This is no time for games.
We can't stay any longer.
Okay, l'll make a deal with you. l'm listening. l'd like your complete attention.
You got 15 seconds.
You want to renegotiate? l'd like to, but l think my mainspring's busted.
Now, about that key.
Where'd you learn a trick like that?
From you.
Don't you remember?
You ''lost'' the key to your car the first night we met.
That's how we got stranded at Waimea Lookout.
Well, where is it? l threw it over there.
You threw it?!
Hey, Uncle Rick, what are you doing digging for sand crabs?
Not exactly.
We're playing a game called ''one of our keys is missing.''
Oh, gee, can l play, too?
Why not?
First one to find it gets a great big kiss.
Aw, heck, l'd rather have a hot fudge sundae.
Look, Rick, l'll explain that it all happened because of me. l don't think that'll help. l wonder if they've dropped the death penalty for kidnapping.
Daddy won't be mad,
Uncle Rick.
He knows l'm with you.
Sure.
Hey, you shovel for a while.
Jan, you better get dressed.
How did it go?
What a mess. l straightened everything out except Belden.
He's already filed a formal complaint.
We could lose our charter to operate.
What are you doing here so late?
Waiting for Rick and Jan.
Where did they go?
Rick took Jan with him to Kauai on a job but that was hours ago. l phoned the hotel, but they said he'd left there... with three picnic lunches.
Three?!
Maybe he picked up a playmate for Jan.
Yeah, sure.
A playmate named Lani.
Some playmate.
What time did they leave there?
This morning.
MGA six-seven-zero calling helicopter two-zero-two.
Rick, this is base.
Can you hear me? Over.
[ Skipped item nr. 1157 ] l'm sure of it.
She'd better be.
Where are you going?
The last time he was with Lani they spent three days at Moonlight Beach. lt was their favorite hideaway.
But he wouldn't go there with Jan along, would he?
Wouldn't he?
Sometimes he seems so nice.
You're married, remember?
You stick by the phone. l'm going to try to find them.
Stay clear of the blades.
Hey, why don't we build a signal fire with driftwood like they say in the Brownies? lt's a good idea.
We'll rest awhile, and if no one sees us then we'll, uh, then we'll start walking.
Let's get some driftwood.
Hey, Uncle Rick, they say in the Brownies that seaweed makes more smoke.
Want to put some seaweed on it?
Sure. Why not?
Whew!
What would we do without the Brownies?
Uncle Rick, look!
Hey, it must be Daddy.
He's come to rescue us.
Yeah, l think l'm going to need rescuing after he gets here.
Daddy! Daddy!
Are you all right, honey?
Oh, l'm fine.
We had a wonderful time.
We went on a picnic, we got marooned we lost the key and then we built a big signal fire.
Listen, you can tell me all about it later, Jan.
Now you just get inside. l've got to get you home.
Your mother's worried about you.
Danny... l can explain the whole thing to you.
Oh, l bet you can.
Go ahead.
We were stranded... marooned. l lost the key.
Aw, come on.
That gag was old when you first started using it ten years ago.
But it wasn't his fault-- l lost the key.
Oh, sure you did. l must have been crazy to think l could go into business with you.
We were booked solid today and your little stunt cost us every passenger not to mention keeping
Jan out all night and scaring us half to death.
We thought you were spread out all over some mountain.
Calm down, Danny. l'm telling the truth.
We lost the key, we spent the whole night looking for it.
Save it. You can bring the chopper back in but you and l are through.
Our partnership's dissolved.
Good-bye, Uncle Rick. lt was a wonderful picnic.
Yeah.
A registered letter for Mr. Richards. l'll take it.
Thank you. l'm glad you're back, but where are Danny and Jan?
Aren't they back yet?
Danny called Betty--
Jan's all right.
He was refueling at Hanalei, but that was quite a while ago.
Ah, he flies that thing like an old lady from Pasadena.
Oh, this just came for you. l was glad to know you hadn't crashed.
That's a matter of opinion.
Going somewhere?
Danny thinks he can get along better without me so let him settle up with Blackmont any way he wants to.
And that evens up the score.
That's life, fun and games.
Too bad Danny didn't realize that before he put himself into hock for all this.
That's his problem. l got my own to worry about.
Has there ever been anyone but you, really? l mean, have you ever cared about anything or anybody without thinking what they could do for you? l tried to explain to him it wasn't my fault, but he wouldn't listen. l think you're more to blame for what happens to you than you're willing to admit. l think you're bitter and arrogant and-and just plain selfish.
Danrick Airways.
Oh, hi, Betty.
No. No, not yet. l-l'm sure they're all right.
Rick just came back.
You sit tight. l'll ring you the minute they get here.
Where could they be?
They should've been back here long before this.
There's nothing l can do about it.
Belden's had me grounded for 30 days.
Rick... l'm sorry, l didn't know.
Forget it.
Somebody has to find them.
You better notify the authorities.
That'll take too long. l'm going in the plane.
Hey, Friday.
Wait a minute. lf they're down, you'll never get there in a plane.
We'd better take the chopper.
But if you fly, they'll revoke your license for good.
Well, that's a chance l'll have to take.
Would they go this way? lt's the shortest route home.
The only place to land around here is that stretch of beach.
Rick, over there to the left.
Uncle Rick! Uncle Rick!
You all right, Jan?
Yes, but Daddy's hurt.
Where is he?
-He's over there.
-Let's go.
Hey, Rick!
You wait right here.
Rick!
Mountain climbing again, native? l tried to check the damage to the rotor blade. l slipped and fell. l think my leg's broken.
Hey, Rick!
What can l do to help?
Get the first aid kit out of the chopper.
Why didn't you radio? lt conked out when we came down. l tried to set her down easy, but without power l couldn't move away from the ledge. l'm going to get you fixed up.
Hold it. Easy.
Take it real easy.
Take Jan back to the chopper and wait there.
He'll be all right now, Jan.
We didn't have first aid in the Brownies yet. l know, honey.
You did very well.
But l lit the flares.
All by yourself?
Daddy showed me how. lt's real easy. ls it? l never lit one.
Well, you see, you just pull the paper off the end and strike it like a match. lt's a lot easier than building a fire.
Mm, sounds like it. l wonder if the Brownies know about flares?
Watch it.
Come on, attaboy.
All right, what happened?
You wouldn't believe it just like l didn't believe you.
Don't tell me you lost your key.
Worse than that.
After we left you we stopped at the plantation to call Betty and gas up.
Then we took off again.
15 minutes later, l was in trouble. l was so upset, l forgot to fill her up. l stopped using that gag
15 years ago.
You think she'll stay there?
She'll stay there until l get help to move her.
But remember one thing.
Yeah, what's that?
That's your chopper.
Let's go.
Thank you, nurse. l'll be back.
Another contact?
Well, you never know.
She could send us some customers.
You know, like, uh, people with broken legs.
How do you feel, Danny?
Ooh, l can't kick.
Very funny.
What about the chopper?
Well, l ordered the parts.
We should be able to fly her out of there in a few days.
A lot of good that'll do us, huh?
With me in that cast and you still grounded.
What's happening with the board?
When are they going to make their ruling?
Next week.
And with my record they'll never let me near an airplane again.
But it was an emergency.
Yeah, but they got rules and they don't like to see them broken. lf l could just talk to Belden.
But he won't even see me.
He's going to be guest of honor at the Polynesian
Welcoming Festival.
Yeah? When's that?
Saturday.
But you won't be able to talk to him there.
Why not? lt's a big affair, top entertainment.
Hey, Jan's going to sing. lf l can't get Belden to listen to reason, we've had it. l told you before, you won't be able to get near him.
Look, why don't we forget the whole thing and open up a pizza parlor, huh?
Any of those girls ltalian?
Now you're starting to sound like me.
Polynesian Welcoming Festival.
Oh, won't you come home
Bill Bailey?
Come on home
She moaned the whole day long l'll do the cookin', honey l'll pay the rent l know l done you wrong
Ah, yes, indeed, ah
Remember that rainy evening l put you out
With nothin', oh, nothin' but a fine-tooth comb?
You see, l know l'm to blame
Well, now, ain't it a shame?
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home?
Won't you come home,
Bill Bailey?
Will you please come on home?
This woman moaned and groaned l'm telling you, a-moaning and a-groaning
The whole day long, she said l'll do the cooking, honey l'll pay the rent l know l done you wrong
Yes, indeed, ah
Remember that rainy evening l a-put you out
With nothing, oh, nothing, but a fine-tooth comb?
You see l know l'm to blame
Well, now ain't it a shame?
Ah, Bill Bailey, won't you please come ho-o-o-ome?
Now, now, now, now, Bill Bailey
Won't you please come home?
Oh, you were fine, honey.
Just fine.
Everybody else seems to think so, too.
Sounds like they want more.
First rule of show business:
Always leave them wanting more, right, Uncle Rick?
Right.
You were great, Jan.
Thanks. l'm hungry!
-Me, too.
-Me, too.
You having a good time?
Oh, yeah.
Relax, they said Belden wouldn't be here till later.
You might as well enjoy yourself in the meantime.
Oh, well, l am.
But only because you decided to come along and l promise your husband will never know.
Rick, there's something l think you have the right to know. l want you to know...
Uh... let's dance, huh?
What about our food?
Well, l-l-l'm not hungry.
We'll work up an appetite.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?!
Oh, oh, l'm sorry, what were you saying?
Nothing, nothing at all. lt wasn't important.
Why did you stop?
We were just starting. l-l-l'll explain it to you later.
What's the matter? l think l better wait for Belden outside. Look.
Pua and Lehua?
Yeah, they're all here.
So? l told you everybody on the island would be here.
Oh, no!
Stop...
Where you are
Don't move an inch
Don't come any closer now, baby
You'll be in a pinch
Don't start what you can't finish l warn you what's in store lf it's love you're looking to get
You're gonna get what you're looking for
Stop...
Where you are
You'd better freeze
Don't fool with fire now, baby
Don't be a tease
Don't start what you can't finish l told you once before lf it's love you're lookin' to get
You're gonna get what you're lookin' for
Don't you know
You're walkin' on dangerous ground
Listen, babe, when l make love l just don't fool around, no, l don't l just don't play around
Stop...
Where you are
Just take it slow
Once l put my hands on you, baby l won't let you go
Don't start what you can't finish
One kiss and l want more lf it's love you're lookin' to get
You're gonna get what you're lookin' for
Stop...
Where you are
Don't move an inch
Stop...
Where you are
You're gonna be in a pinch
Stop...
Where you are
You're gonna get what you're looking for
Bop-bop, bah
Bop-bop, ba-dah, bop
Bop-bop, bah, ba-dop.
Gee, that was swell,
Uncle Rick. l'll just look outside for Belden.
But you haven't eaten.
Who can eat?
There's a storm brewing and l got to get out of here before it hits.
Oops, too late. lt just hit.
No wonder you're too busy to come see me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Hi, Jan.
Hi, Lani.
When are we going on another picnic?
Well, it looks like we're on one right now, honey. l didn't know you girls knew Rick.
Apparently he went right through the sorority.
What loyalty. l wonder if he got to our house mother?
Uh... if you'll excuse me, l was just leaving. l've got business to settle with you first.
That has a familiar ring.
Don't tell me you've been sending him customers, too.
Look, ladies, l can explain the whole thing.
Well, how'd he hook you in this deal?
''You scratch my back and l'll scratch yours.''
Oh... ls this any way to run an airline? l have every intention of paying you for the services rendered.
Wouldn't that be spreading yourself a little thin? l'd like to make it up to you if you'll just give me a chance. l-l'll put it on a cash basis.
A percentage of all the business you book for us.
A percentage? ln writing? ln writing.
Do you think we can trust him?
Well, l guess it couldn't hurt.
Any more than it already has.
Okay, for money, l'll swallow my pride.
And if he doesn't come through we'll boil him in coconut butter.
Been nice doing business with you all. l think my date's getting cold.
Bye, girls. l'll check with you later.
That's quite a harem.
Well, look, uh, l may have made some promises but that's as far as it went.
You're pretty free with your promises.
How you going to keep that last one? l'll tell you after l talk to Belden.
Good luck, Rick.
The performance is about to begin in the amphitheater.
Now look, l agreed to the pancake or whatever it is but the lipstick is out.
But, sir, it's necessary for the television camera.
Those are my orders.
No lipstick.
-Mr. Belden.
-Yes.
Congratulations, sir.
Oh, thank you. l realize this is an honor but they're making me feel like an actor.
Who are you?
Have we met?
Oh, well, sort of-- l-l know this is not the time or the place to discuss business, but... l make it a rule never to discuss business outside my office.
Well, you wouldn't see me at your office, sir.
And this is an emergency. l'm Rick Richards.
Rick Richards?
Oh, you're the one responsible for my wife not being here.
She threw her back out when you ran us off the road. lf you'll just listen,
Mr. Belden. lf l don't get my license reinstated l'm in real trouble.
My partner, Danny Kohana, hocked everything to go into business with me and now he's laid up with a broken leg. l know all about the rescue.
We're not trying to run you out of business and we're not unfairly rigid in our interpretation of the law.
We realize, occasionally there are mitigating circumstances.
Then l-l'll get my license back?
Oh, when the board meets next week l'll make the recommendation. lf a man risks his entire future to save a friend he can't be all bad.
Well, thank you,
Mr. Belden. Thank you.
Besides... this is the first time l've been able to get out without my wife in years. l think l like it.
Thanks again, Mr. Belden.
By George, l think he did it.
He did.
We're back in business.
All you need to do is get rid of that concrete cowboy boot. l'd like to talk to you, Mrs. Hudson.
Well, Rick, there's something l've got to explain to you about Friday.
Danny, l can spot a single girl with my eyes closed-- strictly on instruments.
Excuse us, pal.
You knew all along?
There's some things you just can't hide.
Why didn't you say something? l didn't want to spoil your fun... and mine.
Oh, no!
This is my heaven
Being here with you
Make it last forever
This is my heaven lt's a dream come true
Make it last forever
Here 'neath the sky
Beside the sea
This is my heaven
When you
Come to me
La, la-la, la, la

Hawaii, USA!
Once upon a time... or maybe twice, there was an unearthly paradise called...
Pepperland.
80,000 leagues beneath the sea it lay, or lie, I'm not too sure.
Pepperland is a tickle of joy on the blue belly of the universe.
It must be scratched.
Right, Max?
- Yes, Your Blueness.
- What?!
We Meanies only take no for an answer.
Is that understood, Max?
No, Your Blueness.
That's better.
Are the troops in readiness?
No, your Blueness.
- The Bonkers?
- No.
- Clowns?
- No.
- Snapping Turks?
- No.
- Anti-music missiles?
- No.
- The dreadful Flying Glove?
- No.
Splendid!
Today, Pepperland goes bluely!
Fire!
The Meanies are coming!
The Meanies are coming!
Glove, Glove, come here, Glove!
Look out there, and what do you see?
- Tell him, Max.
- Someone running, Glove.
Well, you'll soon put a stop to that, won't you, Glovey?
Go, Glove, point!
And having pointed, pounce down!
I haven't laughed so much since Pompeii!
What?! What?!
The Glove is losing his touch.
Do your worst!
Explode them!
It's not polite to point!
Thing of beauty... destroy it for ever!
Sir, Sir, the Blue Meanies are coming!
Not here, Young Fred.
They wouldn't dare.
They would. They are.
What are you going to do?
Finish the quartet.
Fire!
Trio, sir?
Duet, sir?
Duet?
Solo!
Young Fred, the Blue Meanies are coming!
4 scores and 32 bars ago,
- our forefathers...
- Our quartet?
- And foremothers...
- Another quartet?
Made it in this yellow submarine...
- What, that little thing?
- To Pepperland.
Climb aboard, Young Fred.
But, sir, I can't even make my soap float.
I'm appointing you Lord Admiral.
Lord Admiral?
In that event, yes.
Hurry, Young Fred.
Go! Get help!
Where should I go?
No time for trivialities.
Woe... is me.
Liverpool can be a lonely place on a Saturday night.
And this is only Thursday morning.
Compared with my life,
Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl.
Nothing ever happens to me.
I feel like an old, splintered drumstick.
I'd jump into the River Mersey, but it looks like rain.
Nothing ever happens to me.
Puss, puss-puss.
Puss, puss, puss. Here, pussy.
Here, pussy, pussy, pussy.
Here, pussy, pussy.
Ahem, er...
Would you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a yellow submarine?
No, I would not.
Oh yeah, I didn't think you would.
I could have sworn there was a yellow submarine.
But that isn't logical, is it?
It must have been one of them unidentified flying cupcakes or a figment of my imagination.
But I don't have an imagination.
Help, help, help!
Thanks, I don't need any.
Help! Won't you please, please help me?
Be specific.
...Blue Meanies!
What you need is...
'H' for hurry, 'E' for ergent,
'L' for love me and 'P' for p-p-please help.
Hiya, baby!
Your story has touched my heart.
Jump in, we'll get my friends.
- Bless you!
- Did I sneeze?
- Just park it here.
- I'll just park it here.
What would your friends be doing here?
Displaying.
- Displaying what?
- Displaying around.
Can't we take one of these?
No. I only work with my mates.
Frankenstein?
I used to go out with his sister.
- His sister?
- Yeah. Phyllis.
Hey, I wonder what would happen if I pulled this lever.
You mustn't do that.
Can't help it.
I'm a born lever-puller.
Ringo, I've just had the strangest dream.
I warned you not to eat on an empty stomach.
Now listen to Old Fred.
...Blue Meanies!
What do you think?
I think he needs a rehearsal.
When do we leave?
Let's get the other two, John.
- What day is it?
- Sitarday.
Then George will be here.
George, what are you doing up there?
Now, what is it, Ringo?
Is there a matter you'd like to take up or down?
This chap here...
...Blue Meanies!
You're nuts, the pair of you.
Wait a minute, that's my car.
- How do you know it's your car?
- I'd know it anywhere.
- What's it look like, then?
- It's red with yellow wheels.
I mean, blue with orange wheels.
It's all in the mind.
- Move over, I'm driving.
- I got here first.
- I'll drive, if you like.
- No, you sit in the middle.
- I'm sitting in the middle.
- You said you were driving.
- I am driving.
- I'll get in the back, then.
Do you think we're interrupting something?
I think so.
We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?
It's all in the mind.
Try one of those doors.
Yes, they do look very nice, don't they?
Yes, they do.
- They do, though, don't they?
- Yes, they do.
- Don't dey, dough?
- Dough?
- Don't ask.
- Dat's dough.
What's the matter, fellas?
Blue Meanies?
Well, lads, what do you think?
I think that...
Remember, there'll be rough seas ahead.
So, what do you think?
Well, then, um...
Pounding, overwhelming waves.
What do you think of that?
- Well, I think that...
- As a matter of fact, I...
I think...
- Well?
- I've forgotten.
Right, then, let's get this vessel shipshape.
I kind of like the way it is, submarine shape.
So, this is a submarine.
Soft, isn't it?
Not if you're on the bottom.
All right, lads, time to stow the gab and turn to.
Groovy. How do you start this thing?
It starts with a Blue Meanie attack.
Supposing there's no Blue Meanies in the neighbourhood?
Then you start looking for a switch.
Perhaps this is it.
What time is it?
It's time for time.
Look, the hands are slowing down.
- Do you ever get the feeling...
- Yeah.
That things aren't as rosy as they appear to be under the surface?
What's happening, John?
In my humble opinion, we've become involved in Einstein's time-space continuum theory.
- Relatively speaking, that is.
- Of course.
- Maybe time's gone on strike.
- What for?
- Shorter hours.
- I don't blame it.
It must be very tiring being time, mustn't it?
- Why?
- It's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it?
- You surprise me, Ringo.
- Why?
- Dealing in abstracts.
- Just because I'm a drummer...
- I don't half feel funny.
- You're not half the lad you used to be.
Look, everything's getting bigger.
It's not.
It's us that are getting smaller...
- I want my mam.
- And younger.
There you are, lads.
Old Fred will get you out of all this.
Look at that!
- It's all a load of Father Xmas's.
- It's not. It's Father Time.
- How do you know?
- I read it in a book.
I don't want to alarm you, but the years are going backwards.
What's that mean, Old Fred?
If we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we'll all disappear up our own existence.
- What are we gonna do, then?
- We could always try a few buttons.
I want my mam.
Time's fast running out for us,
I'm afraid.
- Can't we do something to the clock?
- What do you mean, John?
Move the hands forward, see what happens.
Clever lad.
Something strange is happening.
It's speeding up now.
Funny... a submarine remarkably like our own.
Uncannily.
There's someone in it. Look.
- And they're waving.
- It's a group of fellas.
Wave back.
Maybe we're both part of a vast yellow submarine fleet.
There's only two of us.
Then I would suggest that yonder yellow submarine is ourselves
- going backwards...
...in time!
Look at Ringo.
Oh dear, we're all the same.
Senile delinquents.
And I can hear my beard growing.
We'd better do something.
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen, but would you agree that we have been passing through the Sea of Time?
That would explain a few things.
I'm glad I'm not young any more.
Or was it old?
- What kind of a sea is this?
- The Sea of Science.
Oh, yeah.
- He looks wrong.
- He doesn't look at all well.
In fact, he's horrible.
He's so ugly.
Really ugly!
Somebody push a button.
- There's a Cyclops.
- Can't be. He's got two eyes.
Then it must be a bi-Cyclops.
- There's another one.
- A whole cyclopedia.
There's a school of whales.
- They look a bit old for school.
- University, then.
- University of Whales.
- They look like dropouts to me.
You've got to steer clear.
- Steer clear?
- Yes, steer. Clear?
Yes, dear.
Now, whatever you do, don't touch that button.
- Which button?
- That one.
This one?
That was the panic button.
- Poor Ringo.
- Poor lad.
Never did no harm to no-one.
Lads, now Ringo's gone, what are we gonna do?
Learn to sing trios.
No, let's save the poor devil.
I see footsteps.
- It's a pair of kinky boot-beasts.
- Preparing to attack.
- I don't half miss Ringo.
- He's far out there.
Always was.
- Here comes Ringo!
- 'H' is for hurry!
There goes Ringo.
It's seen us.
Find a boxing button.
Whoever heard of a boxing button?
Who cares? Find one.
Fire one!
Uh-oh, wrong one.
That.
There goes Ringo again.
- Rides well, doesn't he?
- 'E' is for ergent...
Oh no, not the dreaded vacuum flask again.
- We'll be sucked into oblivion.
- Or even further.
Put her in reverse.
So long, sucker.
- Too much.
- Too soon.
Reverse! Reverse!
- Ringo time.
- 'L' is for love me...
Indians!
Help! Help!
'P' is for please...
So, press a button.
- How was it, Ringo?
- 'Arrowing.
Look who's back.
Full speed ahead.
- Oh, no.
- The motor's packing in.
By all the sea nymphets, we're losing power.
We're being swallowed.
What shall we do?
- Serve tea.
- Lovely.
By Neptune's knickerbockers, she's puttered out.
- Maybe we should call a road service.
- Can't. No road.
And we're not sub-scribers.
Subscribers!
I know something about motors.
Let me have a look.
- Here.
- Is that the motor?
Can't you tell one when you see one?
Of course I can.
Let me peruse it.
- What do you think?
- I think I burned my finger.
Here, lads. Look at this.
- What do you think it is?
- Nothing.
Looks like nothing.
It's a local inhabitant.
He's probably one of the nothings.
At least that's something.
- Let's show him our motor.
- Steady on.
You don't want to show your motor to just anybody.
But this is a nobody.
Medic, pedic, zed oblique, orphic, morphic, dorphic, Greek.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
Can you tell us where we're at?
A true Socratic query, that.
And who the Billy Shears are you?
Who? Who indeed am I?
Jeremy?
Hillary?
Boob?
- Ph. D?
- Who?
Eminent physicist, polyglot, classicist, prize-winning botanist, hard biting satirist,
- talented pianist, good dentist, too.
- Lousy poet.
Critic's voice, take your choice.
- Must be one of them angry young men.
- Or a daffy old creep.
I, daffy old creep?
- Do you speak English?
- Old English, middle, a dialect, pure...
- Well, do you speak English?
- You know, I'm not sure.
He's so smart, he doesn't even remember what he knows.
Why don't we show him our motor?
Should we really... show him our motor?
He may not have seen one before.
Turbo-prop, super-combustible spring.
Metrocyclonic and stereophonic, this motor, I see, has a broken down thing.
- He fixed it.
- He fixed it?
Great. Let's go.
I must complete my bust, two novels, finish my blueprints, begin my beguine.
Must you always talk in rhyme?
If I spoke prose, you'd all find out,
I don't know what I talk about.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
Hey, fellas. Look.
The footnotes for my 19th book.
This is my standard procedure for doing it.
And while I compose it,
I'm also reviewing it.
- A boob for all seasons.
- How can he lose?
Were your notices good?
It's my policy never to read my reviews.
There must be a word for what he is.
Okay, men, all aboard.
Let's go somewhere.
What about him?
He's happy enough going around in circles.
Poor little fella.
I don't know.
Ringo's just a sentimentalist.
Look at him.
Can't he come with us?
Mr. Boob, you can come with us, if you like.
You mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man?
Come on, we'll take you somewhere.
Okay, Booby. Down the hatch.
Down the hatch.
A quite curious phrase.
The middle South Midlands
Victorian phase.
Its usage undoubtedly on the increase.
I must work it into my New Statesman piece.
- That's the hatch, friend.
- Indeed.
Steady now, crew.
Prepare to go forward.
- Forward.
- Forward.
Forward!
It's awfully quiet.
What shall we do, Jeremy?
Repair, revive, revamp, renew.
Ipse dixit, just turn the screw.
- Log sign, clog sign, big thingamabob.
- What's he saying?
- What's he doing?
- Chewing gum will do the job.
A turn of the screw, and all is...
...and all is new.
I can't stop her.
'H' is for hurry, 'E' is for ergent,
'L' is for love me...
'P' is for... goodbye?
- That was lovely, Jeremy.
- We've lost the sub for good.
- Or for bad.
- Or for worse.
- I'm sorry about that.
- But he did fix the motor.
- Where are we?
- It looks like the foothills.
- The foothills of what?
- The foothills of the headlands.
- Carry on, lads, carry on.
- Certainly was carrying on.
- I feel a draft.
- We must be near the Sea of Holes.
Don't you think we should ask somebody for directions?
Excuse us...
Can you tell us the way to Pepperland?
Thanks.
Gosh, look at all this dust!
Where did it come from?
A chemical error and quite imprecise.
This is a condiment...
- Condi...
- A spice.
- He's right, you know. It's pepper.
- Pepper?
Pepper.
John?
Paul?
George?
Is anybody home?
- Where are we?
- A holey sea.
This place reminds me of Blackburn, Lancashire.
Oh, boy...
How many do you think there are in all?
Enough to fill the Albert Hall.
Didn't Old Fred mention something about the Sea of Holes
- just before the Sea of Green?
- Yeah.
Through one of them slots must be the Sea of Green.
But which? Which one?
Thesis, antithesis, synthesis, causes of causal causation.
Jeremy, what do you know about holes?
There are simply no holes in my education.
You mean you haven't composed a whole book?
Great. What shall we do?
Be empirical. Look.
The booby's making more and more sense.
It's getting better all the time.
Great. Come on, let's all look for the Sea of Green.
The Sea of Holes... into the Sea of Green.
Hydrolate, verdant chrysodine.
I think we're near the Sea of Green.
I've got a hole in my pocket.
Where's Jeremy?
He was over there.
- He's not here now.
- He must have jumped ship, then.
He wouldn't do that.
He's our friend.
Booby, Jeremy, Hillary, where are you?
Pepperland.
A bit salty around the edges.
- Looks all dingy.
- And drab.
And quiet.
Safe at last.
And none the worse for our adventures.
Reminiscent in many ways of the late Mr. Ulysses.
There's an eye in the apples.
There she blows!
Lord Mayor, sir...
I've made it, I'm back.
- Who's this?
- Our Lord Mayor.
He's been bonked.
Lord Mayor, sir... unbonk yourself.
Even a little snatch of a tune might get him up again.
All right, let's sing.
Do I hear music?
Do I see... Young Fred?
You do, Lord Mayor.
Bless my metronome.
And did you bring help?
Yes, yes. Look.
Holy pizzicato, Young Fred.
It's quite uncanny, your faces...
We're quite cute, really.
You could pass for the originals.
We are the originals.
No, no... Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band.
They couldn't be much with a name like that.
Sergeant Pepper?
You could impersonate them and rally the land to rebellion.
Where are your instruments?
- Lost in the Monstrous Sea.
- Sea of Monsters.
We'll get other instruments,
Lord Mayor.
Not a chance.
The Meanies captured everything that maketh music.
They hate music that much, do they?
They shrink at the very sound.
Okay, you guys.
It's shrinking time in Pepperland.
Aim, fire!
He reminds me of my old English teacher.
Look, if you must shout, shout quietly.
- What do we do?
- Coagulate with the crowd.
Cut-outs at the ready.
Then let's cut out.
What a grand bandstand.
That's where the gear's kept.
Come on.
Cavey, cavey.
All right, the coast is clear.
Now's our chance.
- But how'll we get over?
- Easy. Follow me.
A-ha! You fools!
It's not very light in here, is it?
Shh! Keep the noise down.
- Look what I found.
- It's their uniforms.
- Nice bit of gear, that.
- They'll look great on, eh?
- Dey will, won't dey?
- Won't dey, dough.
- How do I look?
- Groovy. How about me?
- Bad scene, lads. We're surrounded.
- Oh, heck.
A million billion Meanies.
They're coming this way.
Hide!
- Do you think they heard us?
- I hope not.
- What did you say?
- Shh!
Good plan.
Look. They're all asleep.
They look cute when they're asleep.
Almost human.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- On tiptoe.
- Tiptoe through the Meanies...
- Shh!
Let's exude.
Relax, lads.
Not a Meanie in sight.
- Not even a teeny Meanie.
- Not even a teeny-weeny Meanie.
- Look. Breakfast.
- I'm dying for a bit of brekky.
Look out.
Sound off, one, two, three, four...
- One, two, three, four...
- Five.
Five?
- Sound off, one, two, three...
- Four.
- One, two, three...
- Four.
- One, two...
- Three.
- Three?
- Two.
- Two?
- One.
One?
Are you Bluish?
You don't look Bluish.
Run for it.
Right, men. We've made it.
- Instruments at the ready.
- Okay, on the beat.
A-one, a-two, a-three, a-four, a-five, a-six.
- Can't you make it three?
- All right.
On the beat of three...
A-one, a-two, a-three...
It's wonderful to be here, it's certainly a thrill.
You're such a lovely audience, we'd like to take you home with us.
We'd love to take you home.
- The hills are alive...
...with the sound of music.
Who is responsible for this?
Rimsky Korsakov?
Guy Lombardo?
My dear friend... let us not forget that heaven is blue.
Tomorrow, the world!
Bring in my Bloobers.
- Who?
- Who?
There you are, my little Glovey-dovey.
Go get thee hence and destroy yon upstarts.
Smash them! Squash them!
Crash them!
Oblue-terate them!
Here, your Blueness, have some nasty medicine.
The Glove, the Glove, the Glove!
- Glove?
- Glove?
He's a clever lad, isn't he?
Open your mouth, it won't hurt.
John, you haven't half got a big mouth, haven't you?
It's easy.
All you need is love.
Go, Glove, lovely Glove.
You took the words right out of my mouth, John.
Hey, wait, and watch.
It's all in the mind, you know.
Hey, that's a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl.
In Pepperland, all things are possible.
- It's not a goldfish bowl.
- Just a big glass bowl, then.
- It's blue glass.
- It must be from Kentucky.
There's something inside.
- Four fellas.
- What are they doing there?
They're not having a ball, that's for sure.
- It can't be.
- It's us.
- But we're here.
- It's Sgt. Pepper's...
- Lonely...
- Hearts Club...
Band.
The resemblance is truly striking.
If I could come in here...
I think the theory put forward by Einstein could well be applied here.
The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking two eggs...
- John!
...beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper...
- John!
- George?
- How do we get them out?
- Break the glass.
- We can't. It's Beatle-proof.
- Nothing is Beatle-proof.
Have you got your drumsticks with you?
A drum break might shatter it.
- No, I haven't.
- Have a look in your pocket.
I've got a hole in my pocket.
I wonder if...
Yeah, it still works.
Ringo, we take back all we said.
You're a genius, a sheer genius.
I know, I know, I know.
- Like coloured telly.
- Like crystal.
They're decanting.
Hello, brother.
Yeah, without a doubt.
- We're the spitting image of each other.
- Golly, yeah.
I'm led to believe that you're an extension of my personality.
- Yes, I'm the alter-ego man.
- And I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob.
I'm glad you asked me that.
Because as a matter of fact there's a war on.
Then, brothers in war, to the skirmish must we hence.
Shall we hence?
Let's not waste time sitting on the hence.
Beatles to battle. Charge!
- We're surrounded.
- Nice dog, though.
What do you say?
Sing it.
Do you know any more?
Play it!
Jeremy, can it be you?
Can it be me? I think you'd better inquire of the guards, for when I was captured, they took all my cards.
Shh, that's enough, Jeremy.
- The whole world's being attacked.
- What do you want me to do?
Do you recommend fisticuffs versus the guard?
Oh, guard!
Blue Meanio!
Left to the nostril, right uppercut, right to the eyebrow, left to the gut.
Jeremy!
Come on, Ringo!
Get back! Get back!
Once more unto the breach, dear Meanies!
You're advancing the wrong way!
Retreat backwards!
Get back there now!
My kingdom for a horse!
I think I'll tear him up into little pieces.
He does, does he?
Yes, I think I'll make a blueburger out of him.
Ha-ha, I don't care what you think.
You don't, eh?
We'll soon see about that.
He does in truth seem quite annoyed, some reference material before I'm destroyed.
Where ground is soft most often grows,
Arise, arise, arouse, a rose.
A rosy nose?
Speak your last piece!
Peace, peace, supplant the doom and the gloom.
Turn off what is sour, turn into a flower and bloom, bloom.
Ha-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom, bloom, bloom...
First time I saw that Nowhere Man, that nobody,
- I knew he was somebody.
- You're right.
Hello there, blue people.
Won't you join us?
Buck up, and otherwise go mingle.
- What do you say?
- Max?
Your Blue...
I mean, your Newness!
It's no longer a blue world, Max.
Where could we go?
Argentina?
Are you with us?
Will you join?
- Shall we?
- No!
Yes, your Newness!
- Yes, Max...
- Yes.
Oh, yes is a word with a glorious ring,
A true, universal, euphonious thing.
In genders embracing and chasing of blues, the very best word for the whole world to use. Ha-ha!
Yes, let us mix, Max.
I've never admitted it before, but my cousin is the Bluebird of Happiness.
- Catchy tune, that.
- I can't seem to get it out of my head.
- Then shake it.
- That's what we've been doing all night.
Yeah, it was a great party.
And we brought back lots of lovely souvenirs.
- Here is the motor.
- And I've got a little love.
- And I've got a hole in my pocket.
- A hole?
Half a hole, anyway.
I gave the rest to Jeremy.
What can he do with half a hole?
Fix it to keep his mind from wandering.
Look at John, will you?
What's the matter, John?
Blue Meanies?
Newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre.
There's only one way to go out.
- How's that?
- Singing.
One... two... three... four
Twelve minutes to race time.
I didn't realize it was so...
- Just relax.
- Let go!
- What are you doing with my date?
- Your date?
I thought she was my date.
No wonder you were so uncooperative.
- Out!
- I like your taste.
Out!
Bye.
I have to change.
It'll only take a few seconds.
- Who was he?
- That was Kenny, my manager.
Some manager!
The minute I walked in here, he grabbed me and started kissing me.
Don't worry about Kenny. He's harmless.
Yes, if you're 6'4" and a karate expert.
How can a guy like that be your manager?
I go back a long way with Kenny, ever since we were kids.
Neither one of us ever had very much.
Whatever he had, we split.
Now he works for me, handles my business... takes care of all my endorsements and all my money.
You mean, you let him take care of your money?
Why not? I like to live dangerously.
- Does that go for girls, too?
- That goes for everything.
Honey, I'm gonna leave the driving to you.
- I wanted to see if it was the same girl.
- It's the same girl.
There's a drivers' meeting in eight minutes.
- You're gonna be late.
- Eight minutes. Oh, no!
- She really had 10.
- Good move.
A new track, a new girl.
You certainly get the goodies, don't you?
It was a chance meeting. I followed her.
Good afternoon, race fans... and welcome to Charlotte Motor Speedway... where we'll soon be underway with the Charlotte 100... first place paying $7,500.
The pits are buzzing with the last-minute checks of everything...
Back to the car wash.
- How you doing, Birdie?
- Hi, Stevie.
- Want a chip?
- No, thanks.
She's purring like a fat cat.
She'll run like a lean one, because I'm going flat-out today.
- Want to wish you luck.
- All bad? At least you're consistent.
- Good luck.
- Yeah, same to you.
Clear the midway.
Remember, everyone must remain behind the pit wall... except the regular crew.
- Run over 'em, Paul.
- Sic 'em, tiger.
The weather is perfect, and the track is fast.
You can feel the excitement in the air.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
You ain't got a chance.
Fans, here we go.
And here's your leader at the moment...
Miss Mary Ann Ashman,
Miss Charlotte Speedway 100.
All cars in their proper position, as we travel around on the pace lap.
...traveling around at about 75 miles per hour... giving all the cars a chance to warm up... and for drivers to check any bugs before we get underway.
A final wave from Miss Charlotte 100.
The pace car heading down under the apron.
Here they come out of the far turn, down the main straightaway.
There's the green flag and they're racing!
Number 42 has moved into third.
/t's still a race for first and second.
Here's the rundown.
Number 21 your leader, Cale Yarborough.
Running second,
Car Number 42, Tiny Lund.
/n third place, the 17 car.
Moving into fourth spot,
Steve Grayson in Car Number 6.
Right on his tail for fifth spot,
Paul Dado in Car Number 43.
/t's still a three-way go for first place.
The 17 car is starting to slow down.
And here comes Grayson to take over third.
Paul Dado rises to take the fourth spot.
The 21 car into the pit with a blown engine.
Grayson in the second spot, and Paul Dado running third.
Look at this. The leader, Tiny Lund, heading for the fifth.
Now it's a race for first spot between Grayson and Dado.
Through the far turn they go, right together.
Steve Grayson holding down the lead.
Come on!
Paul Dado in Car Number 43... starting to move on the leader,
Car Number 6, Steve Grayson.
Side by side they go!
This has been going on for the last 36 laps.
Dado pulling away to take over the lead!
Down into the infield, the 76 car, taking the 80 car with it.
Both drivers are okay.
Paul Dado, holding down the first spot.
Grayson holding on for second.
Grayson's staying right with him.
Here they come, down in front of the grandstand.
Grayson's pouring it on.
Down on the inside.
They're right together.
You could throw a blanket over both of them.
The heat is on.
Grayson pulling ahead in the 6 car.
Here's Paul Dado trying to make up time.
Paul Dado in Car Number 43.
And here comes Dado.
Look at this boy go!
Closing fast on the leader.
Out of the turn,
Paul Dado has closed the gap.
He's right on the bumper of the leader.
Come on, Stevie.
Now they're side by side.
The duel is on for first spot.
How long can they keep this up?
It's been going on lap after lap.
Dado the hard way, around the outside.
Grayson pulling right back up again.
A beautiful job of driving by both of these drivers.
Out of the far turn they go,
Grayson the leader.
The 19 car has lost it in Turn Number 4.
Here's the leader, down the main straightaway.
The white flag is going out.
One more lap to go!
Paul Dado takes the flag and chases it all the way around.
They're going to race for it, right to the flag.
Birdie, look at his tires!
There's smoke pouring out of the wheels of the 6 car.
This could be the end for Steve Grayson.
His tires.
He's chunking rubber all over the racetrack.
Car Number 43 is right on top of him.
There's smoke pouring out of the 6 car!
In front of the grandstand, the checkered flag coming out!
And Steve Grayson earns the victory!
Man, looked like he was really gonna bend his racer.
That was hairy.
Thought he'd be smoked out for good!
I prayed to every patron saint in the book.
I made some up, too.
And from here, race fans, he looks all right.
What a great race!
You'll never see any better than this.
Here's the first three positions as they came across the line:
Grayson, the winner, in Car Number 6.
Second to Paul Dado in the 43 car.
Finishing in third spot, Car Number 3.
- You had me scared.
- What happened? You all right?
I'm still taking an inventory.
I think everything's still here.
You had as much right winning as the man in the moon.
You were way over your head, chunking tires all over the place.
You should've been black-flagged off.
Don't tell the officials till I get my check.
They might disqualify me.
Now, in the winner's circle... waiting for Steve Grayson,
Miss Charlotte 100...
Mary Ann Ashman... along with Hunter McCabe, making the presentation.
It's my pleasure to welcome the winner of the Charlotte 100, Mr. Steve Grayson.
This is Mary Ann Ashman... our beautiful
Miss Charlotte Speedway 100.
- How do you do?
- Mr. Grayson.
Mary Ann will present you with the winner's trophy.
Thank you.
I hope you don't mind kissing each other, just for the newspapers.
Not at all, if it's all right with you.
Well, if it's for the newspapers.
Just in case the newspapers didn't get a good picture.
Come in.
Hello?
Oh, brother!
Is anybody home?
- Hello?
- This is Susan. He won again.
$7,700, including lap money.
My, how interesting!
- It's certainly all adding up, isn't it?
- Yes. First place again.
- He's a real hot dog.
- "Hot dog"? What does that mean?
Just a little race talk I picked up.
You're not there to pick up whatever it is you're picking up.
Yes, sir.
Give me the number where you are, in case I need to call.
I can't do that.
I'm calling from their trailer.
Their trailer? What if they find you there?
I think they'd love it.
Stevie, I've got an idea.
- Is it good or bad?
- I'll call you again tomorrow.
Really, what you ought to do is lie down and get yourself a good rest.
I do feel a little beat.
On second thought... you really ought to stay outside.
Get yourself a lot of fresh air.
That's just what I need, a lot of fresh air.
- Hello!
- Hello.
- Goodbye.
- Wait, I saw her first.
- Bye-bye.
- Why can't I stay? I'm over 21.
Sometimes I doubt it.
- Where did you come from?
- I rang the bell.
A voice said, "Come in," so here I am.
- That was quite a race you won today.
- Thank you.
You've been in the money now 20 races.
More or less. A pretty girl like you didn't come here just to talk about racing.
He didn't.
- Oh, no.
- Surprised?
Wait a minute. I know what you think.
But I didn't suggest it. It was his own idea.
- Of course.
- You've got to believe me.
Obviously, I do.
- Sometimes I think he's five years old.
- Open the door.
Sure, I'll open it, and you're free to go.
I've got a key right...
I got a key somewhere.
It's in my other pants.
You wait right here. I'll be right back.
See? I knew I'd find it.
I'll unlock the door, and you're perfectly free to...
Gone.
Okay, everybody. Regroup.
It's entertainment time here at The Hangout... and you all know the rules.
When I hit you with the light, you gotta get up and do something.
If you don't, we do something to you.
I'm gonna go last... because nobody can follow me.
Okay with the horns. I can take a hint.
- You're on!
- No, wait a minute. Hold it.
I don't want to... Wait a minute.
Okay, all right.
- I see a man coming into your life.
- Do you see him leaving, too?
No, there's no window to sneak through, like some people do.
No, he doesn't leave.
He peers into the crystal ball and tries to think what to say next.
How about "goodbye"?
That's too old-fashioned.
Don't you have any imagination, Miss...
Now concentrate.
Keep your eyes on the watch.
Watch the watch.
Your eyes are getting very heavy.
They weigh about 3 pounds each.
You want to tell me your name.
- What is your name?
- This is getting ridiculous.
You're fighting me.
Let's get back to the watch.
Watch the watch.
- Bottoms up.
- Wait a minute.
- When will I see you again?
- Ask your crystal helmet.
Kenny, how about assisting me with one of my tricks.
- No, thanks. I have a little trick of my own.
- You're cute.
It will only take a minute.
So will mine.
Trying to get away with the mustard, too, fella?
- "Too"?
- Ain't it enough you ate six hot dogs?
Six hot dogs?
I really enjoyed them, too, pal.
There you go.
Come and get it.
That smells good.
I'm hungry. I'm starving.
I'm more starving than you are.
Where'd you get this stuff?
I borrowed it from the cook when he wasn't looking.
Six hot dogs... potato chips... coleslaw, three colas... one diet.
Six hot dogs is $1.50.
Pop, they're the giant size.
Six giant hot dogs.
That's $1.90.
- We don't wanna cheat anybody.
- No, Pop.
- I'll just add these up now.
- You forgot the mustard.
- Hi there, Mr. Grayson.
- Hi, Abel.
So I did.
It looks a little less than half-full.
I'd calculate about 13 and a half cents.
I saw you run today, Mr. Grayson.
You looked like Jack the Bear.
It kind of reminds me of when I was driving.
I'll be out there again as soon as my leg comes around.
You stay off the track.
I got enough competition as it is.
Go on, now.
Ellie, I want you to take this over to the cook, honey.
That's okay. It's been taken care of.
Mr. Grayson, you shouldn't have paid for it.
But, as long as you did,
I'll just sign this over to you.
What is that?
This here is a promissory note for $4.32... plus 6% interest.
That's for the food we took, including the half bottle of mustard and a diet cola.
- Yeah, well, okay.
- All right, we can eat now.
Excuse me.
You got a bunch of hungry kids, Abel.
Well, things have been a little slow, lately.
I try to keep them fed and a roof over their head.
Let's sit down.
The car won't start, so we're living in it.
- "Make the best of life," is our motto.
- You're doing a fine job.
They may even vote you
Mother of the Year.
- You think so?
- Sure.
Mr. Grayson.
Gee, you shouldn't have done that... but I'm glad you did, on account of the girls.
Tell you what.
I'm going to write you an IOU for the $60.
Let's see...
"IOU $60," plus 8% interest.
- When it's cash, we raise the rates.
- Mr. Grayson?
- Steve.
- Mr. Steve?
- Ellie wants to talk to you.
Will you stay for supper?
There you go.
I'll give you the biggest part of my hot dog.
Don't bend it. I'll just take a bite.
We'll have a lollipop for dessert.
I've got a half one hidden.
We'll all take a lick.
That's the best hot dog I ever tasted.
I hate to eat and run, but I don't eat dessert.
So you can have my lick, okay?
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye, everybody.
- What's your name?
- Come on. Not me.
- Yeah, you.
- Oh, no.
Come on, rules are rules.
Go out there and wail.
Marvelous, just marvelous.
See what you can do if you try?
Okay, everybody, let's dance.
Choose your partners and then forget 'em.
Hit it.
- You're good.
- Thank you.
While we're dancing, maybe we can think up a duet.
No, I'm sorry. Someone's waiting.
Who?
- Excuse me.
- Him!
- Paul?
- Yes, Paul.
Bye.
That's the first time
Dado's beat your time all year.
He hasn't got the checkered flag, yet.
There's an old station wagon outside.
Esterlake's? I worked on it for two hours this afternoon.
They should make a floor lamp out of it.
- That bad?
- The worst.
Where's Kenny?
He trapped somebody in the trailer.
Real nice.
That tickles, silly.
Yes, but everything is perfect:
The night, the mood, and the girl.
And, oh, what a girl.
Gee.
Especially the girl.
She's moonlight... she's quicksilver... she's radiant and lovely, and most of all, she's desirable.
I think I better go. It's getting late.
But it's only 10:30.
Look.
I better go. You don't mind?
Of course I don't mind.
Why, I wouldn't even want you to stay here... unless you wanted to.
It must be a decision of your own free will and accord.
You're really very nice.
Most fellows wouldn't be so considerate.
They generally fight me.
I never thought you'd be so...
What's that?
I don't know. We'll just have to turn on the radio and find out.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is an emergency broadcast.
Attention! All the wild animals in the zoo have broken loose.
They are roaming the streets of our city.
Stay where you are!
Well, good night.
- Good night?
- Yes, I thought you were going.
- I couldn't go out there.
- Don't you have to go home?
Couldn't I stay here, please?
- Is that your decision?
- Oh, yes.
- Of your own free will?
- Yes.
Look!
Save me!
You're so strong. Please save me.
- Don't let them in.
- I'm not going to let them in.
Save me. I know you will.
- Don't let them in here.
- I'm not going to let them in here.
Close the door! Don't let the animals in.
- What animals?
- The animals that escaped from the zoo.
- Animals that escaped from what zoo?
- The wild ones. The mean ones.
- Didn't you hear the radio?
- What radio?
- You know, the radio.
- You mean your tape recorder.
Of all the dirty, rotten tricks, this one really takes the cake.
- This is one of his better ones.
- You're ruining me.
I know.
- Where's my wrap? I'm leaving.
- Sit down and I'll help you look.
- You're leaving, aren't you?
- No.
- Well, I must have misplaced it.
- No, you didn't. It's in here.
- What's it doing in there?
- He always puts them in there.
- I'll get you. You wait!
- I'll wait.
Look, at least let me walk you home.
It's dark outside.
- A lady unescorted...
- I'd rather be alone.
- Good morning, Ellie.
- Good morning.
I have a present for you.
You don't have to give me presents.
I like you because you're just you.
But this is a present you can share.
- Is it a doll?
- No.
- Is it a puppy?
- It's bigger than a puppy.
- That's smaller than a puppy.
- What it belongs to is bigger.
It's all yours.
- That belongs to me?
- Yep. You got to get somebody to drive it.
It's beautiful. Can I give it to my Pop?
He can drive.
Say, that's a good idea.
Pop, Annie, Debbie! Everybody!
Look what Mr. Steve bought for us.
There you go, honey. Come on, girls.
And there's enough groceries in here to last you a month.
Aren't you going to give him a note for the car, Pop?
Sure, Ellie.
To tell you the truth,
I'm so shook up, I don't think I could write.
Girls, won't you say thank you to Mr. Grayson and Mr. Donford?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Annie, say thank you to Mr. Grayson, now.
Thank you.
Okay, girls, let's go around and look at the car now.
I just don't know what to say.
- You know something, Mr. Steve?
- What's that?
I wish I were big enough to marry you.
We're nearly at the end of one of the finest races I've ever seen... here at Charlotte Motor Speedway... with a winner's purse of $8,500 plus accessory money.
Here's Steve Grayson, Car Number 6, into Turn 1.
Right with him, in Car Number 43,
Paul Dado.
These two have been cleaning up on all the tracks this year.
Out of Turn 4 they come, side by side.
Grayson's the leader by inches...
Out of the turn, into the main straightaway.
This will be the white flag.
One more to go!
Into the wall! And he's upside-down.
And the checkered flag!
Steve Grayson the winner!
The total purse close to $9,500!
Paul Dado second in the 43 car.
And in for third, Car Number 14.
Mr. Hepworth, he won again. Over $9,000.
He did?
So far, he's the top money winner on the circuit.
Well, money's what we're interested in.
He's sure making a lot of it.
Good.
I love to hear good news.
I'll keep in touch. Bye.
Now down to the winner's circle.
Mr. Steve Grayson, may I congratulate you... on winning the Charlotte Speedway 250.
Thank you.
Isn't there something else that goes with it?
Of course.
Have you made up your minds yet?
Have you made up your minds yet?
The lady and I will have a steak sandwich, medium-rare, please.
Steak sandwich, medium-rare.
Hold the onions, please.
"Hold the onions." How thoughtful.
Baked or French fried potatoes?
Tomatoes.
- Tomatoes.
- No dressing.
- Tomato-wise, I mean.
- No dressing, tomato...
Oh, that's cute.
What dressing would you like on your salad, please?
- What do you have?
- We have French, Thousand Island...
Roquefort, oil and...
- Vinegar?
- Vinegar, yeah.
Thank you.
I'll have Roquefort.
That will be 35 cents extra.
It's okay. She can have all the Roquefort she wants.
That's wonderful.
He doesn't care if it costs extra.
My poor boyfriend, he's so poor he can't afford anything extra.
He needs all his money for school.
He's still got four more years to go... before he becomes a registered nurse.
Nurse?
Male, that is.
I'll get your order with the extra Roquefort.
Thank you.
Problems.
I think she really loves the guy.
I wonder what I can do to help.
The ceremony is really a rocker.
Bye! Thank you!
Have a happy, happy!
Don't forget to take the You Drive back.
- Your bouquet.
- No, you caught it.
And you know what they say about catching the bridal bouquet.
- That's when it's thrown by the bride.
- I was just giving it a little assist.
Hey, wait a minute.
We can't let this happen.
I'm sure we can't, whatever we're talking about.
The bouquet. Look at the way the petals are drooping. They're in a coma.
- What do you suggest, Doctor?
- We got to get it in some water.
- Where should we go?
- I know you'll think of something.
My place is too far, so let's go to yours.
- See? I knew you'd think of a place.
- But we gotta hurry before it's too late.
There he goes with that put-the-flowers-in-the-vase bit.
I'll break the vase over your silly head.
If I were a girl,
I'd let the measles in before letting him in.
- Don't stop now. You're killing me.
- You know what else she should do?
She should pile her furniture against the door.
Now, miss, if you want someone who's mucho charming... who's a champion furniture pusher, I'll...
She's gone.
- Why did they call me in?
- You've been making it big recently.
They call in everyone over a certain income. It's just routine.
Yeah? Well, I'm worried.
You've got nothing to norry...
Nothing to worry about, Mac.
It's like your friend says.
It's just routine.
Thanks.
You had my income tax made out by a reliable man, right?
- Well, of course.
- Of course what?
I had your income tax made out by a reliable man.
You're looking me straight in the eye.
That means you're lying.
- Boy, I'm in trouble.
- No, you're not.
- Then why am I here?
- Maybe they just want to get acquainted.
- Knock it off.
- You know something?
- You're scared.
- You better believe it.
Just like everybody else in this room.
These tax people are nice, warm, friendly people.
Thank you, Mr. Hepworth.
See how relaxed he is?
All right, sir. It's all right.
You'll be just fine.
You'll be all right, sir.
We'll get you a drink of water.
Mr. Steven Grayson, please.
I'm Mr. Grayson. This is Mr. Donford.
I'm Mr. Hepworth.
Well, you don't need me.
Come with me, please.
Please be seated, gentlemen.
Would you care for anything:
Cigarettes, cigars, soft drink?
A straight scotch with a gin chaser.
No, thank you, sir.
We won't have anything.
Quite an interesting tax return you made out, Mr. Grayson.
I made out.
- You made out the form, Mr. Donford?
- All by myself.
Well, congratulations, Mr. Donford.
I'd like to shake your hand.
It is the most ridiculous... impossible, jumbled, disorganized return...
I have ever seen in all my 30 years.
- I ought to break you in half.
- You'd then have two very short friends.
Funny.
You have a great many deductions
I would like to have explained.
Under "business entertainment":
Rental of a powerboat listed at $100 a day... and $200 a day...
- for bait?
- Bait?
- We had to buy presents for the girls.
- Presents?
That's what you classify as bait.
Yes, we didn't do much fishing.
But, boy, did it work out!
Disallowed.
"Depreciation on stock car.
"Salaries for the mechanics.
Bonuses and percentages."
That's all right.
"Gas, tires, maintenance."
That's all right.
$4,000 for air?
Now, that I don't understand.
I'm with you. Explain that one, will you?
We stopped in this gas station... to check the tires.
But Steve... he got to talking to the owner of the station... and he told us how tough things were.
So we invested $4,000 just to help him out... and he blew the money. So I figured...
The air cost $4,000.
- Disallowed.
- Right.
"Station wagon, furniture,
You Drive trailer...
"flowers," etc... all listed under "charities."
- Very commendable.
- Thank you.
Watch out for the zinger.
Unless these are registered, recognized, licensed charities... these deductions cannot be allowed.
- Now, just one minute.
- Skip it, Kenny.
- We spent that money!
- I said, skip it. Tie your tie.
Now, under "business deductions"... you have listed a $22,000 trailer... with various mechanical and electronic devices... perfumed record albums... and pages and pages...
Stop right there, Mr. Hepworth.
There is no sense in going on.
There's been a lot of mistakes made.
- We'll do something about it.
- That's about the size of it.
How much does "about the size of it" amount to?
About $145,000.
That's an awful lot of money.
Now, if you agree to an arrangement we have in mind... one of our staff will collect all of your earnings.
You will be put on a strict budget until you repay the government... every penny you owe.
All of a sudden, he decides to test the car at 6:00 a.m.
And I got home at 5:00.
- He's really giving it a beating!
- I bet nothing's wrong with it.
You know Steve.
When he's mad and he wants to find...
- $5 he don't.
- You're on!
Run her up, Birdie.
- Any problems?
- Not a one, man. She's really honking.
See you guys later.
"Honking" means she's running exceptionally well.
Scratch.
Thank you.
Steve, I've got it!
- You got what?
- The check from the last race.
- What do you mean?
- Right here in my sneaky hand.
Mr. Hepworth is sending someone to collect the money.
Yeah, I know, but I thought we could hold onto it.
- No.
- On a permanent basis.
We made a deal, and we'll keep it.
Steve, $7,500 in case we need a few essential luxuries.
You aren't an honest person.
- That's part of my charm.
- Give me the check.
It doesn't belong to us. Get in the car.
You're making a mistake.
A guy's got to live.
You can't...
Hello, Mr. Hepworth, I went to collect the check, but it was gone.
We had an agreement, and I trusted him.
This is very discouraging.
I'll get the check back. Don't you worry.
It shows you how much
Mr. Grayson's word means.
I hear music. Where are you calling from?
Your expense account doesn't include going to dances.
I know, sir. I'm in his trailer.
It sounds like wild animals.
Are you being attacked?
Not yet. Mr. Grayson isn't here.
He's got all kinds of gimmicks in this trailer.
Gimmicks? You be careful.
Oh, yes. I'll be careful.
And I'll get that check back, too. Goodbye.
That figures.
Relax.
Let every muscle in your body go limp.
You never felt so good.
You don't want to go home.
You're beginning to get tired. Tired.
Hi there. No, don't move.
I want to remember you exactly as you are.
The check, please.
- What did you say?
- She said, "The check, please."
I speak her language.
If she said "The check, please," that means...
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- My name is Susan Jacks.
I work for the Internal Revenue Service.
Beautiful. Just beautiful.
According to Mr. Hepworth, you made a certain agreement.
Remind me to write him a nasty letter of thanks.
- Let me handle this.
- You've done enough already.
But you're too honest to deal with her.
I'll be back. I have to wash his car.
Here's the check.
Thank you.
You must understand... that you owe the government a great deal of money.
Unless you pay it promptly, your indebtedness will pyramid... and you'll never be solvent again.
I don't think you realize the gravity of the situation.
- Let's sit down and discuss it.
- Yes.
First, there's the amount of your allowance.
You understand it must be a minimum figure.
In order to pay back $145,000... we must be as efficient as we possibly... can.
Interest compounds.
Therefore, the quicker you make restitution, the better.
Now, I know it's going to be...
- a pong lull.
- Long pull.
This situation demands drastic measures.
- As to your allowance, Mr. Grayson...
- Anything you say.
As to your...
Allowance.
Your allowance.
Mr. Hepworth thought that $100 would be sufficient.
I can make out fine on $100 a day.
No. Your allowance will be $100 a week.
$100 a week?
I spend more than that on Band-Aids.
- I'm afraid that's it, Mr. Grayson.
- What are you trying to do to me?
Nothing.
I only work for Mr. Hepworth.
I don't make any rules.
- Sure, sure.
- But it's true. There's nothing personal.
- I'm just carrying out orders.
- And loving every minute of it.
If you don't believe me, call Mr. Hepworth. There's the phone.
I know where the phone is. I live here.
Well, I'm afraid we have nothing more to say to each other.
- I'm not through with you yet.
- Goodbye, Mr. Grayson.
Is everything all right, Miss Jacks?
Did you and Steve reach a nice, fair, liberal allowance?
Somewhere in there there's room for an answer.
Your allowance will be $50 a week.
That's the wrong answer!
Boy, did you ever fix it!
Do you know what my allowance is gonna be?
No, but mine is $100 a week.
We can't live on $150 a week.
You've gotta talk to her.
I wouldn't ask that iceberg for anything even if...
- If we were dead broke?
- Yeah.
We're dead broke.
What happened to the money you were supposed to be holding?
We should have a few thousand.
- There were expenses.
- What else?
- Presents.
- Go on.
Phone calls! Lots of phone calls.
Hello?
- Is this Donford?
- No, I'm not in right now.
I know it's you. This is Tillman.
I'm glad you called.
No, you're not.
Your horse didn't come in again.
You better pay the bread. I'm getting tired of carrying you on the books.
I'll see if I can't try and squeeze you in on Saturday.
Saturday's as far as we go.
Goodbye, baby.
Baby?
What room did you say Miss Jacks was in?
- You're right!
- Yes?
- Hi, remember me? I'm Kenny.
May I come in, please?
American Beauty roses for an American beauty.
All right, give me the pitch.
No. The roses are yours, to have and to hold. No strings attached.
No, thank you very much. You have them and keep them. Good night.
There is one thing we might discuss.
You see, it concerns...
You tell Mr. Grayson... that I'm not empowered to make any changes... in his arrangements with the government.
- And even if I were, I wouldn't.
- Mr. Grayson did not send me.
He doesn't send me, either.
He doesn't even know that I came here.
I'm here on an errand of mercy on his behalf.
- How much?
- Well, I'm embarrassed for him.
Embarrassed for how much?
About $7,500 worth.
If you could just give me back the check he gave you...
- Out.
- Please.
Don't blame him. Blame me.
Some men are weaker than others.
- Out!
- Don't bother showing me out the door.
I'll use the window.
- May I open it for you?
- You're very polite.
I don't jump out of windows unless they're in the basement.
Chicken.
Bye.
Come in.
- Mr. Grayson.
- Yes?
- Here are your flowers.
- Well, thank you.
Your allowance check will be $64.50.
Wait a minute.
I thought it was supposed to be $100.
I called the florist.
What has he got to do with my allowance?
The flowers were charged to your account. $35.50.
Now, $35.50 from $100... leaves $64.50.
I wouldn't send you flowers...
- if you were the last person on earth.
- I have some advice for you.
- Lf you're trying to trick me...
- What do you mean, trick you?
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't know.
Furthermore, I've had just about enough.
My dinner!
No, Steve won't make a move without first asking for my advice.
I leave nothing to chance.
First, I analyze the wind... then the time of day... and then the angle of the track.
Then I sit down with Steve, and we have a nice long talk.
I tell him exactly the way
I want him to drive.
No, we don't win by chance.
The whole thing is psychological.
Listen... what do you say we go someplace just a little more private?
- I want to talk to you, Donford.
- Donford? There must be some mistake.
- That's not my name!
- Yes, it is!
If you don't get the bread before Saturday,
I'll beat your brains out.
- You understand that?
- Yes.
I understand. Saturday.
Ellie, what are you doing here?
I know you didn't want us thrown out of our station wagon.
Who threw you out of your station wagon?
Sorry to break in on you this way,
Mr. Grayson.
- What's this about being thrown out?
- They repossessed it, Mr. Grayson.
Terrible shock.
Repossessed it? That's impossible.
They had a paper. All legal and everything.
Yes, Pop?
Would you put the other girls to bed, honey?
- Put them on the couch.
- That will be fine.
This whole thing is ridiculous.
I gave Kenny the money to pay cash for it.
I'm sure you did.
I guess it's not so ridiculous after all.
I hope you don't mind, but it's way past the girls' bedtime.
What?
- The bedroom is right back there.
- Good. Thank you.
I'll get you some milk later, honey.
- Pardon me.
- Sure.
I see we have visitors.
- You'll excuse me if I go to bed.
- Hold it. It's occupied.
Why didn't you pay cash for that station wagon?
- Oh, that.
- Yeah, that.
Hello?
Lori, what's the matter?
They repossessed our furniture.
What did you do with the money
I gave you for Lori's furniture?
I'm still working on the station wagon.
This is no time to be funny.
I wanna know... Lori, hush.
I want some straight answers.
What did you do with all that money?
What happened to the money?
I was held up!
You're looking me straight in the eye again, and that means you're lying.
I'll be with you in a minute, Lori.
Now out with it!
Not you, Lori. You!
I've always liked the horses, but I could never pick them.
The more I tried to get even, the deeper I got with your money.
I'm sorry, Steve.
Where are you now, Lori?
We're spending the rest of our honeymoon... at his mother's house.
I'll get back to you. Don't worry, honey.
I don't deserve to be called "honey."
- Good night, Mr. Grayson.
- Good night.
Hello.
Susan, Paul. I'm down in the lobby.
Yes, Paul, I'm ready.
I'll be down in a minute.
I don't recall inviting you here.
I hate being here as much as you hate seeing me.
- That finishes our visit, doesn't it?
- I've got to talk to you.
- I have an appointment.
- And I need $7,500.
Good night, Mr. Grayson. There's the door.
Look, everything I bought for the Esterlakes, Lori, and the others... has been repossessed.
- You should have paid cash.
- I thought I did. I got to have the money.
That's against the rules of the Internal Revenue Service.
Good night, Mr. Grayson, and goodbye.
Don't "goodnight and goodbye" me,
Miss Internal Revenue Service.
- Get your hands off me!
- You'll listen to me first.
It was a fist. I saw it.
It's a game.
- I'm not finished with you yet.
- Watch where you're going!
Please, there's a man after me. Stop him.
Hey, you. Come back here.
- Please don't let him get me. There he is!
- Excuse me.
I'm sorry. I have to catch that plane.
I mean, that girl.
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me. Pardon me.
- No, you don't.
- Somebody call the police.
I know you're in here somewhere.
You'll listen to me.
No, I'm not.
I will talk sense to you, if it's the last thing I ever do.
That will be the last thing you ever do.
If I could get near you,
I'd knock that stubbornness out of you.
I want to see the manager.
They ought to condemn that elevator.
- George, I want you to sue this hotel.
- Yes, dear.
- We're checking out right now.
- We're not even staying here.
- I've got you. You listen to me, will you?
- Let her go.
- Make me.
- Gladly.
What floor, buddy?
No, you don't.
You're gonna listen to what I have to say.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
- Let go of me!
- What's everybody looking at?
You sit here and listen to me.
You are the most obstinate, stubborn, ornery, impossible girl I ever met.
You just won't admit there's another side.
My side.
You know why?
Because you're unreasonable.
Sit still. You're argumentative, mulish... uncooperative... and unbelievable.
No. It could never work.
We're complete opposites.
You're wild, extravagant, and unreliable.
You're not the kind of man that I should fall in love with.
And besides, we don't even like each other.
- Hi, Steve.
- Hey, it's late.
- Why aren't you in the car, sleeping?
- I couldn't close my eyes.
- How'd you do with Miss Iceberg?
- Great. Just wonderful.
- You got the money.
- Not exactly, but we can get it.
- You're kidding!
- No, not at all.
You're supposed to be the smart guy.
Why didn't you think of it?
- What's "it"?
- The trailer trap, man.
- We can sell it.
- Sell it? The trailer trap?
Sure, we can get at least $12,000 for it.
We can pay everybody we owe, and all our problems are solved.
How can you think of selling the trailer trap for a measly $12,000?
It's worth a lot more! It's worth at least...
Oh, boy.
What are they doing here?
The company repossessed the trailer trap.
They're adorable.
Good night!
Oh, boy.
- I've got to get some money somewhere.
- Yes.
My stock car. I could sell it for at least $10,000 or $15,000.
No, you can't.
You'd be giving up your future.
What future?
Wait a minute.
Operator.
- Hello?
- Hello, Mr. Hepworth.
Hello. Susan?
Yes. The Charlotte 600 is on Sunday, and...
Let him keep some of the money to pay his personal obligations?
We can't do that. It's against the rules.
Well, then he won't race.
And he'll sell his stock car.
But he can't do that.
But he will, unless you agree to his proposition.
If he wins the 600 on Sunday... we could collect a lot of money for the government... plus all the winnings from future races.
Plus?
Well, in that case, all right.
And in the future, Susan, don't call me at 4 a. M... unless it's as important as this call.
Bye.
You're the greatest.
You'd better be the greatest on that track tomorrow.
- And qualify, right?
- Right.
It was nice of you to call Mr. Hepworth.
We're in qualifying for the World 600.
Come on!
Down to the flag.
There's the white flag.
If he puts his hands out, he'll fly like a bird.
Paul Dado on his first time at 35. 15.
35 seconds and 15 one-hundredths.
- Come on!
- Go!
The checkered flag.
And the time...
It's a beauty! 35.10.
Well?
He qualified. Man, did he ever qualify!
35.10 seconds.
That would be 153.484 miles per hour.
I'll have to stand on it.
That means push the accelerator to the floor.
I know.
Grayson, always a tough qualifier, will have to really go.
He's got some real good times to beat.
Right out of Turn 2.
There's the green flag.
Boy, he is really honking.
Time to beat. 35. 10... to make it into the first four positions.
Out of Turn Number 4.
The white flag. Coming up, the finallap.
The first time around.
The time at 35.05.
That puts Steve Grayson in the first six cars.
Wide out of the turn...
You're home free.
The checkered flag.
Grab hands, girls. Come on. Let's go.
Steve Grayson climbing out of the 6 car.
He looks all right.
Grayson was really on it when he came down to the flag.
He made it, even with the spin, into the first four positions... with a time of 35.03.
I feel fine. Birdie, did I qualify?
Yeah, you qualified, but you sure made a clunker out of that car.
Clunker means that...
Well, it's no problem.
Birdie will have it fixed in no time, I hope.
Well, you might as well get started now.
Come on, kids.
I've seen blown engines before, but, boy...
Never mind the details.
Just put another engine in here.
- Speak to Kenny.
- Repossessed.
- All of them?
- I tried to hide one, but I couldn't lift it.
- Can this be fixed by tomorrow?
- We can't fix this in two tomorrows.
They took all our spare parts, too.
We don't even have one spark plug.
What are we gonna do now?
- Why don't you go and buy some?
- With what?
All right, then. Borrow some.
Even if we could borrow the parts, we couldn't fix it that fast.
How do you know unless you try?
She's right. I think you can do it.
You drive 'em, Steve. We fix 'em.
I tell you this clunker can't be ready for the race tomorrow.
- What's the first thing to be done?
- Get new engine parts.
I could be a mite helpful in the parts department.
- Good. I'm glad somebody can help.
- What are we waiting for?
All right, come on.
- Come on.
- Okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Is it all finished?
- All finished.
From the Charlotte Motor Speedway, the World 600.
The green flag is out, and we're racing!
Into the first turn, it's a scramble for the first spot.
The 14 car takes over the lead.
It's Paul Dado in car 43 around the outside.
Something's wrong with Steve Grayson...
This is a new one for me.
He's dragging.
Come on, stand on it, Steve.
Grayson can't get up to speed.
We'll keep an eye on him while the rest of the track is jockeying for position.
The 43 car, Paul Dado, he's still riding the outside... picking off car after car.
Still the leader, Car Number 14.
Paul Dado now running second.
Steve Grayson has dropped back to 12th position and running low.
From here, it looks like Steve Grayson is having handling problems... or something is wrong with the weight distribution.
Come on. You're no feather-foot.
Any of you guys leave a tool kit in that car?
Paul Dado driving a perfect race... still picking off cars and coming up on Grayson.
When he does come around, he will have lapped the 6 car.
And here he comes on the outside.
There he goes, and Grayson's now one lap down.
Tough break for Grayson, the fourth fastest qualifier.
What are you doing here?
After we finished working,
I guess I fell asleep in the car.
Lay down and hang on.
The weight's killing me.
I'll just hang on.
The 6 car heading for the pits.
Still having trouble.
- What's slowing you down?
- Get him out of here.
Holy smoke!
Come on! Let's get him out of there.
- Can you make up the time?
- I've got to. Where am I?
You're way back.
- Get off the track.
- I'm not on the track.
Get him off the track!
You all right?
Am I out of the car?
Steve Grayson in Car Number 6 comes back into the race, one lap down.
The leader in Car Number 4,
Paul Dado in Car Number 43.
Dado holding the first spot for the last 192 laps.
And here comes the 6 car, Steve Grayson.
Man, is he moving!
Already, he's picked up four cars.
He'll have to pass the leader,
Paul Dado in Car Number 43... to be on the same lap.
Look at this boy go!
He's going to try it on the outside.
There it is.
He's on the same lap with the leader and pulls away.
Car Number 6 is passing cars at almost record speed.
We've got him on the last lap... at 149.06 miles per hour.
That should be a great credit to his crew.
Already, he's made up three-quarters of a lap, and he's looking for the leader.
Here he is behind Car Number 43... hitting the wall, trying to get by... and he made it.
Steve Grayson in Car Number 6.
That's your new leader.
Grayson has been holding the lead now for the last hour-and-one-half... riding the high groove and pulling away as we come to the last five laps.
Steve Grayson, after all kinds of problems... has made a fantastic recovery.
He's coming onto the track one fulllap down. Made up for one lap... turning this track at almost record speed... to take over the lead with only three more laps to go.
The battle is still on.
Paul Dado in the 43 car is trying to recover that lead.
The yellow flag comes down.
The car losing it in the turn,
Number 88, is okay.
We're down to the last two laps.
Please. Come on, Steve.
One more lap to go.
It's Grayson and Dado, they'll race for it right to the wire.
Both drivers coming out okay.
Steve Grayson's real steady with only a half lap to go.
And the 9 car loses a wheel.
And this will be your winner.
Paul Dado wins!
Car Number 43.
Here comes Grayson out of the car.
And he seems to be all right.
The fire crew is there.
Well, race fans, we've seen a beauty.
Darling... you were wonderful.
- Flat-out all the way.
- A lot of good it did me.
You tried.
Steve, I figured it out.
Counting lap money, you get $7,670 for third place.
- How about that?
- That's marvelous!
That's enough to get you out of trouble.
We can pay off the furniture, we can get the station wagon back... and we've got $170 to celebrate with.
$170 goes to Uncle Sam on account.
On account of what?
On account of you still owe him $137,000, plus interest.
She's right.
It's back to The Hangout for the victory dinner. Beans and hot dogs.
-Allow me.
- Thank you.
Over here!
Hi. How are you?
- What took you so long?
- We found a new short cut.
Can I have a beer, please?
You'll also have cokes.
House rules for minors.
- We're over 18.
- Sure you are, dear.
How come they call this place a tea house, dear?
It's something that was in and now is almost out, so we'll rename it something further in or further out.
- Clever.
- That light...
If the fuzz comes, it'll blink on and off, so dump the beer.
Dump the waitress!
Thank you very much, and thank you, Herbie.
Herbie and his "makes-you-wanna- sit-this-one-out" orchestra.
Back in your cages, fools!
Now, ladies and gentlemen, while our mariachis are recuperating from their activities, the Tea House presents that young man whose songs have electrified colleges and enraged campuses all over the nation.
A young man who would be playing in San Francisco, if the authorities there didn't misunderstand him.
A young man whose charming manner conceals the instincts of a mau-mau.
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen, the one and only Charlie Rogers!
- What'll it be?
- The All-American End!
The Witches of Wellesley!
The Day They Hung
The Rap On Dean Semmilweiss!
How about that?
You girls are new here, aren't you?
Get rid of the guys and I'll meet you later.
Knock it off, buddy.
- Don't get sore.
- He's only kidding.
- Sure, I was kidding.
- Go ahead, sing.
A little thing for our friends on fraternity row.
- He kills me.
- I think he's smooth and sexy.
He's funny like a case of travelling mumps.
I'll bet he never got further than grammar school.
- That's right.
- Is he getting away with this?
No. Just cool it a minute.
I'll be back in 10 minutes with the football hero's lament,
I Left My Knee At USC.
- You're taking it bigger than usual.
- Good.
- Might mean trouble.
- So what else is new?
Why do you act tough?
Where does it get you?
If you're not tough, you get squashed.
- I didn't have any parents, either.
- What's that got to do with it?
- Everything.
- Save it, kid.
- Got a light, friend?
- Sure...friend.
About your act. I've heard buzzards sing better than that.
And this is a crummy joint.
I've seen more action in a zoo.
- From which side of the cage?
- What's that supposed to mean?
You figure it out, college boy.
I'm going outside and get some air.
Let's get him.
George, let me have the phone.
Is that your 'cycle?
Stop reading those hot rod magazines, buddy.
'Cycle is out.
It's either bike or motorcycle.
- Made in Japan?
- That's right. Made in Japan.
Aren't American 'cycles good enough for you?
You don't dig world trade after all the economics they shoved into you?
Get off, buddy.
- Come on!
- No. That's karate!
- That goes with the 'cycle.
- Charlie, are you all right?
What are you doing?
I can't afford trouble.
Charlie, go. The cops are coming.
They'll close me up.
That temper of yours!
- Lay off!
- I've had it, Charlie. Get out!
My arm's broken.
All right, Rogers, you wanna come with me?
- What's up?
- In there.
You're free to go.
Your lady friend paid your fine.
- Hi, baby.
- Thanks.
You wanna check this to see if it's all there?
Six bucks, lighter, lucky tiki god.
You got an honest department.
We also have your bike. It's outside.
Give this to the officer.
- Do I have to sign anything?
- No. Just stay out of trouble.
- You're asking the impossible.
- I'm not asking, I'm telling.
Remember, we've always got an empty cell in there.
I like your hospitality, but I don't think I'll accept it. Goodbye.
Officer, you in charge here?
- That's right.
- I got a motorcycle.
Right over there.
- Drive carefully.
- Yeah, sure.
- I guess I'll be cutting out.
- We got no choice.
- We?
- I can get a job anyplace you do.
The next tea house is about
1,500 miles west, like in Phoenix.
- Besides, this bike's built for one.
- It has a back seat.
- I'm sorry.
- I could have let you rot in there!
Bailing me out doesn't mean you own me.
Nobody can own you, I know.
But I'm hung on you.
- We've been through it before.
- I know. Just laughs.
I told you I'm not the kind of guy...
- Why don't you break my arm?
- See you around, kid.
I'll pay back the fine as soon as I get a job.
Keep in touch! Ya big ape.
Those fresh kids think they own the world!
Don't pay any attention to him, Cathy.
You're kinda pretty, you know that?
- What are you doing?!
- Let him get by.
Somebody's got to teach him a lesson.
- Want to go for a ride with me?
- You fresh punk!
Cut it out! It's not his fault you have a hangover.
Hey, stupid! It's a public road!
Didn't you know that?
My aim must be getting bad.
I thought I hit you.
- Joe, you'll kill him!
- He won't get hurt.
Stop it, please!
- I'm not gonna let him pass me!
- Stop it! For heaven's sake!
- Stop! Stop!
- It wasn't my fault!
He's supposed to know how to drive it!
He's moving, isn't he?
He's all right.
- Are you all right?
- He's bleeding!
Get the first aid kit. Hold this.
Great. That's all I need.
What kind of crazy stunt was that?
You hotshot motorcycle kids, more of you ought to be run off that highway.
- You're asking for it!
- Easy. Joe got carried away.
- Somebody will carry him away!
- I said sorry.
- He didn't.
- I'm not going to!
You're acting like a kid. We can talk or you can blow off steam.
There's nothing to talk about!
You're gonna pay for this bike.
- You talk big!
- We have enough trouble.
- Trouble I made?!
- She didn't say that.
- That's what she meant!
- That's exactly what I meant!
I hate to break up a family argument, but who's gonna pay for this?
I'll send somebody back for your bike.
Some men from the carny.
The carnival. I own it.
We're setting up at the picnic grounds.
- What about this?
- I'll buy a new one.
Get into the Jeep.
OK. Just don't try to pay me off in cotton candy.
- Let me give you a hand.
- Get your hands off her.
- Easy, pop.
- Don't call me pop.
Mom? Just kidding. Just kidding.
Maggie, you get in the back.
I want Cathy up here with me.
- My name's Charlie Rogers.
- OK.
- Look, I didn't do nothing.
- My name's Cathy Lean.
Cathy, turn around.
Where do you want the platform for the skin show?
- lsn't it staked out?
- Yeah, but we're not sure.
Can't you guys do anything right?
Come on.
- This place don't show much.
- Wait till you see it at night.
- Hope I don't have to.
- You'll be around for a while.
They're not big with Japanese motorcycle parts out here.
- Show him around. I'll park.
- OK.
If I'd known he was a kook,
I wouldn't have buzzed him out there.
He's not a kook.
Sure. Everybody goes around knocking guys off bikes just for looking.
He's my father. He worries about me.
She worries about him.
Everyone needs somebody to worry about them.
- They're good friends.
- Sure.
What did I say this time?
- It's what you didn't say.
- All right.
If I take my foot out of my mouth, will you show me around?
All right.
I don't know where to start, but...
What's with this tennis court?
The lines show where to stick front end, pig iron and butchers' shops.
How's that?
The concessions, rides and candy stands.
I see. What's this over here?
- What's a hot wagon?
- Generator truck.
- Drome? That's the...?
- It's right over there.
High wall, motorcycle stunts.
This wouldn't happen to be...?
Donniker, exactly what it sounds like. The rest room.
- Grease joint?
- Hamburger stand. Right over here.
What are the big fans for?
They blow the smell of onions around.
Makes people hungry.
Pretty good.
Here we have the Mugg Joint.
Photo gallery.
"You don't know how you look till you get your picture took."
Just what I thought.
The Dirty Show.
Not what you're thinking.
They throw baseballs
- and knock a girl into a water tank.
- What's dirty about that?
The lot lice get their jollies from it.
Look, I know I'm supposed to know, but what's lot lice?
- Customers who don't spend.
- Why don't you speak English?
For the same reason doctors write prescriptions in Latin.
To keep us separate from earth people.
Earth people?
Civilians, those who aren't with it.
Anyone who isn't a carny.
- What was that for?
- That was for what it was for.
- But why?
- Look...
- You kiss every girl you talk to?
- No.
You kiss the ones you do kiss this soon?
- Why should I explain...
- I see.
You figure you won't be here that long. Excuse me.
- We're not through talking yet.
- I am.
Strike one.
She'll be back.
What do you do when you're not riding around on your bike?
- Besides that.
- I sing a little.
You going to be late for your next job?
- I don't have one.
- Where were you going?
Phoenix. I got a buddy that owns a nightclub there.
- Where's home?
- A swamp outside of Shreveport.
- Any relatives?
- Not that I can remember, no.
- How old are you?
- Are you making out a police report?
I like to know what my money's being invested in.
It's being invested in a new guitar and a bike with a bent front end.
I'm stuck here until it's fixed.
I'll bet you're broke.
How will you eat?
I'll manage.
How about a job here until your bike is fixed?
- I could use a good roustabout.
- Me, work in a circus? No.
It's a carnival.
There's a big difference.
How about it? This is hard work...
On second thought, forget it.
- You're too soft for real work.
- Just a minute.
OK, but I'm not biting the heads off any chickens.
That went out 20 years ago.
A little muscle everywhere.
We all do everything here.
What about Joe?
He won't bother you if you don't bother Cathy.
- That's the whole idea.
- That's your problem.
Where do I sleep?
Over there.
Last trailer on your left.
- Now you're a roustabout.
- Is that good?
Here we go, Charlie. All right.
Straight up.
Got it?
OK, get the pin in. There.
- Plan on staying?
- Are you kidding?
I'll be out of this sawdust trap as soon as my wheels are fixed.
This is for guys who've got nothing better to do.
I like white sheets, bright lights and a lot of dough in my pocket.
Then you'd better get out quick.
- Sawdust gets in your veins.
- It won't happen to me.
Aren't you guys finished?
I'll take care of that.
Go help Estelle in the mitt camp, then report back.
- What's a mitt camp?
- The palmistry tent, over there.
One thing I like about you, Joe, you got a very likeable way.
- Cody, let's get this other one up.
- Here we go.
- Don't you believe in knocking?
- How do you knock on a tent?
What's your name, beautiful?
Charlie Rogers, handsome.
What's yours?
Professionally,
I am known as Madame Mijanou, but you can call me Estelle.
I'd rather call you Madame Mijanou.
What do you do here?
- That depends. By day or night?
- I hope you're not a mind reader, because if you are,
I'm about to get my face slapped.
- I am a seeress.
- A what?
A seeress. Sit down.
I read the past, present and future.
You are the son of a Roman baron.
You have come to this country on a diplomatic mission.
You will bring great financial reward to your native land. Right?
Sure. But right now I'm a roustabout, here to give you a hand.
Which hand do you want to give me?
The left hand, being closest to the heart, reveals much about love.
Let's forget the fortune-telling.
What do you want me to do?
I can tell you what kind of woman will be attracted to you.
I'm old enough to figure that out.
- What do you see in my eyes?
- Maybe I'd better slap your face.
I like you, Charlie.
But do you think maybe
I'm a little too mature for you?
Women are like wine.
They improve with age.
- But you don't drink?
- I'm an alcoholic.
- Estelle!
- Who's that?
- Probably my boyfriend.
- You don't care?
- Not if you don't.
- I don't.
- What does he do?
- He's a knife-thrower.
I think I care.
I've heard of heartburn, but aren't you going too far?
- What's your gimmick?
- It's legit. What's yours?
I'm just a roustabout.
Charlie Rogers.
- I'm BJ Lewis.
- What's that stuff?
- Gasoline.
- You use regular or ethyl?
- Whatever I can get.
- Why don't you fry your tonsils?
It's just a matter of getting used to it. Watch.
I bet you get invited to a lot of barbecues. How'd you get into this?
- My doctor told me to quit smoking.
- No, seriously.
- I started out as a sword swallower.
- That's nice.
OK, OK, I believe you.
All my life I've been afraid of everybody and everything.
I thought doing something dangerous would show people I had guts.
You keep swallowing that and you'll show them you've got guts, all right.
Anybody can eat fire.
Do you want to learn?
- I gag on Spanish rice.
- Hey, you!
- Yeah?
- Down here, stupid.
Kid, you'd better grow up before you pick fights with grown-ups.
- What do you mean, "kid"? I'm 38.
- Congratulations.
You Charlie Rogers?
Joe's been looking for you. Come on.
Hey, BJ, if I need a light,
I'll let you know.
What's the matter?
- Bring those back.
- Don't be funny.
- Come on, reach for them.
- Will you hand us our robes?
- Throw 'em, Billy.
- I can't throw 'em that far.
Don't come any closer.
He can see under the panels.
- Come on, throw 'em.
- Go ahead, Billy.
- There.
- Come on!
- I'm turning blue from the cold.
- Yeah? That's my favourite colour.
- Here you go, girls.
- Thanks.
- Is this on your work list?
- Just getting to know the family.
- Joe's at the grab joint.
- Thanks. What's a grab joint?
Hot dog stand.
- You walk me over?
- I'm headed that way.
- Want to go for a ride?
- Where?
To the moon, if we can get the juice.
- You can't...
- It's ready for a test, isn't it?
Haven't you anything better to do?
- Can't say that I have.
- Joe will be mad.
Joe's mad at the world.
- I don't want to get you in trouble.
- I already am. 27th floor.
All right.
Cody, you haven't seen
Charlie Rogers, have you?
No, just giving the wheel a trial spin. Greasing up the cables.
Cody, bring us down, will you?
You haven't seen him?!
You get your head out of the way.
I'll give him something to wake him up.
Get him out of there.
Just what do you think you're doing?
Just a little ride. Coffee break.
- Cathy, we open in three hours.
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- You get back to work.
- I asked her to go for a ride.
If it'll make you feel better, here's a half a dollar.
I told you to go back to work.
I'm telling you flat.
Stay away from my daughter.
I told you I talked her into it.
Maggie can hire tramps if she wants to, but you better not get out of line again.
He never would have known if you'd learn to keep your mouth shut.
Thanks for the try, Cody.
All right, Beeps, hit it.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Step lively, folks.
The show's all on the inside.
See it all, see it on the inside.
Step lively, folks. Let's not be blocking the tent. All on the inside.
Here they come. On your toes.
Here she is, a 26-year-old lovely little bearded lady from Afghanistan.
Here's my little torch holder,
Louise.
And there, ladies and gentlemen, before you, is the tallest living man on this Earth!
Ain't that a pretty little balloon, boy?
Kid, give me that! What do you think you're doing? Hey, you!
Anybody like a big beautiful balloon?
And wouldn't this lovely lady like to know what the future holds?
- How much?
- 50 cents is all it's gonna cost.
How would this lady like to know about the handsome man in her future?
I already know all about it, brother.
You can't win 'em all.
- There it is.
- How long you been doing this?
All my life. My parents were carnies.
- Still gets to you?
- You don't see it?
- It's a carnival.
- Don't hang around too long.
- You got your religion, I got mine.
- Your bike will be ready Friday.
- Why so long?
- They don't work tomorrow or Sunday.
Help out on one of those rides.
I've got something to do.
Sure.
Mr Nielsen.
Mrs Morgan, I was coming to see you.
- To pull the rug from under us?
- As a matter of fact, l...
-..was.
- I'm sorry. That's my job.
I know. "l just pull the switch.
I don't sentence the guy."
The bank wants to know when to expect last month's payment.
When I get it.
I'll have to tell them something more definite.
- Business looks pretty good.
- Could be a lot better.
We've been rained out four Saturday nights.
It would be OK if we didn't owe you.
That lawsuit could have finished you if we hadn't come to the rescue.
And delay the day of reckoning. Tell your thick-skinned friends in Topeka that their money's a lot safer if we stay open.
Close us down and they'll get
10 cents on the dollar.
The bank would prefer it if the man who caused the accident was gone.
I'm to blame.
I let the insurance lapse.
Mr Lean was drunk when he set up that ride.
He's the best man around, and as long as I'm open, he stays.
- All right, I'll tell them.
- You do that.
I don't think they'll listen.
Three balls a quarter!
Drop the lady in the water!
Yes, sir.
Get your pitching arm going.
Stand back, son. Watch this.
- Try again, sir.
- Dad, can I get a candy apple?
We got a live one!
Every pitch a direct hit!
- Step right up! Yes, son?
- Candy apple.
Thank you. Charlie, can you relieve me here for about 10 minutes?
- How do I get in?
- There.
Step right up. Get your crackerjack, apples and popcorn, folks.
Peanuts, crackerjack, popcorn and candied apples. Step right up.
This apple has a worm in it!
There's no extra charge for the meat. Beat it.
I'll be right back.
Over here. Knock the stuffing out of a stuffed cat. Try your luck.
You, sir, win a prize for the lady.
Hold it, kid. You're not fast enough.
Kid, come here. Come here.
- Gee, thanks.
- Don't try it again.
- How are you doing?
- I'm getting thirsty.
- Put me on the cold drink stand.
- Carbonated or non-carbonated?
Surprise me, as long as you don't change the scenery.
Knock the stuffing out of a stuffed cat. Try your luck.
- She's a real doll.
- Cathy's a good kid.
Look, I don't mean to tell you how to live, but I'd stay clear if I were you.
I already got that clue from big daddy.
I guess he wants her to marry someone with class, like the tattooed man.
- He wants the best for her.
- Two crackerjacks. Thank you.
So why don't he get her out of here?
Cathy wants to be here. As long as she is, he can keep an eye on her.
- Yeah. So will l.
- OK, I'm back.
Like I said, we all do everything here. Where to next?
She's not doing too well on the cat rack.
- If you think you can do better.
- Sure, I can.
- Try it.
- Step right up. You, sir, over here.
Three for a quarter. Try your luck.
Right over here, folks.
- You, sir, try one free.
- Free? All right.
And here we have a winner, folks.
Step up here.
We would, if he had paid.
You're not cut out to be a huckster.
You're not much of a shill, either.
Why don't you give me a try?
I'm pretty persuasive.
So I hear. Good luck.
All right, step over and throw the ball at the pussycat.
How about you? Right over here.
Only 25 cents.
One lousy quarter it costs you.
Come on, anybody?
What's the matter?
Hey, you, buddy, over here.
Hey, you? You, sir.
I'm talking to you. Come over here.
- What are you doing?
- Come here. Throw the ball.
I don't want to throw the ball.
Let go or I'll call a cop. Crazy nut.
- He didn't want to throw the ball.
- You were wonderful!
I'm not through yet.
Not you, kid. You're too young.
Come along with me.
There's a winner.
Give the little boy a prize.
Here you go, sonny.
That'll be one dollar.
That was just a sample,
Now it's three for a quarter.
Everybody, come on!
Three for a quarter!
Well, I'll be damned.
- What's the count?
- Only fair.
- We'll have to do better.
- You heard from the bank?
Stop worrying. We'll pay them off.
Was somebody from the bank here yesterday?
- Yeah. Nielsen.
- You used to tell me these things.
- You've got enough to worry about.
- Like setting up rides properly?
What's bothering you?
You never used to hire anybody without my OK.
We lost four men on our last move...
Because of my pleasant personality!
They weren't much good anyway.
- What's really bothering you?
- All right.
- That bum you hired.
- Not again.
- The kid is trouble!
- For you or Cathy?
He drew a crowd at the cat rack.
Maybe he can pull them into the tent.
- You're makin' a big mistake!
- Let me be the judge of that!
- Morning. How's your new guitar?
- lt'll do.
- That's gracious of you.
- It's a replacement, not a gift.
I came to say how good you were last night, but forget it!
- What'd I do now?
- What are you so angry about?
Your guitar was smashed.
Maggie bought you a new one.
- Can't you just say thanks?
- OK, OK. Thanks, Maggie.
- How's that?
- You fascinate me.
That's the best news
I've heard all day.
No, the way you go around with a chip on your shoulder, singing in some joint and then moving on.
You mean instead of leading some secure life like in a carnival?
- But you're alone.
- So is everybody else.
- Everybody has some kind of folks.
- Like Joe?
- Joe's had a rough time.
- Pardon me while I cry.
Have you ever?
It might do you some good.
We're gonna start the first show of the evening!
Right down here! It's all free!
It's free down here! Come over!
There's gonna be nothing else going on until we finish the show.
We're gonna have first a little music for you. Musicians, come out here!
How about that for a fine bunch of boys? And girls!
Bring out those beautiful girls!
They're four of the finest dancers in the world, direct from Paris.
Not Paris, Texas. Paris, France.
Look at that beautiful figure. Look at the... All right, that's enough!
They've not paid anything yet.
All right, come right up.
And now I take pleasure in presenting the one and only Charlie Rogers!
You wanna see the rest, buy a ticket.
Show starts in five minutes.
Line up here fast and get your tickets!
Come on in! You're gonna see something you've never seen before.
Come on.
As I promised you!
Bring out those beautiful girls!
- I want to talk to you.
- It's your phone booth.
I was out there.
I heard them. You were great.
I want you to stay on with a contract.
I'll pay you union scale.
And no muscling rides. Just singing.
- No, thanks. Friday is go day.
- I don't get it. Why not?
- I don't buy the whole scene.
- I'd pay you more if I could.
- It's not just the money.
- Then what is it?
I don't want to get involved.
- Just take care of number one?!
- That's right. Doesn't everybody?
No. No. You learn that, you may start coming alive from the waist up.
My friends, this is Paris.
Gay, beautiful, wonderful, magnificent Paris.
Paris: The tender mother of romance.
Of love. Of amour.
But not all the love stories of France begin in Paris. No, no, no.
There was one, for example, a quite unusual one that began in the hot...
...sun-drenched region in the south of France...
...in the province known as Provence.
The time is around the turn of the century.
You call it the Gay Nineties, no?
But that is beside the point.
This is the story of a little female citizen of France...
...who is as beautiful and as innocent as her name.
And her name is Mewsette.
No last name. Just Mewsette.
Hello, Jaune Tom.
Hello, Mewsette.
That was a very nice song you were singing, Jaune Tom.
- Please sing some more for me.
- Mewsette...
...you know I can't sing it when you're looking at me.
Amour, amour...
...a- mush.
Jaune Tom! Jaune Tom!
Jaune Tom, you're wonderful.
Jaune Tom!
A moose! A moose!
I mean, a mouse.
It's as big as a moose.
- I mean, it's a whopper.
- A mouse?
Where? Where?
At the barn. Hurry! Hurry!
Come on, let's go!
Jaune Tom, you're a...
...clumsy country clod.
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo!
Hey, Jaune Tom.
What are we going to do with our mouse?
We'll wrap it as a gift and give it to Mewsette.
Mewsette...
That's all I ever hear around this place.
But, my dear sister, how can you continue to bury yourself on this farm?
I like it here, Jeunesse, chérie.
I choose to live here.
And now, tell me about this friend of yours in Paris.
- Is he nice?
- My dear sister, what manners.
So polished.
Not at all like the plebeian peasants you would meet out here.
The peasants, they are good and honest...
...and very happy.
Happy, on this pile of dust?
How can you allow yourself to go to seed like a fat duck?
- Ducks don't go to seed, my dear sister.
- Well, like a vegetable then.
That's what you are, Marie:
A cabbage, an artichoke.
True, Jeunesse, and vegetables are happiest on farms.
But, darling, think of Paris.
Lovely, gay Paris.
Have you forgotten the sidewalk cafes and how we sipped champagne?
Champagne. That must be what they call catnip in Paris.
How nice.
The button champignons sauteed in butter with tiny shreds of ham.
Champignons.
I know what they are. Mushrooms!
And delicious too.
- And, my dear, the Champs Elysees.
- Champs Elysées?
- I wonder what they taste like.
- Oh, what a lovely feline.
Too bad her beauty is wasted here.
Now, in Paris, she would be perfumed and curled...
...and have a stunning coiffure.
We would go everywhere in style, wouldn't we, chérie?
The Rivoli, Maxim's, the Place Pigalle...
...boating on the Seine...
...with the music of Paris surrounding and caressing us.
Oh, those nights. So sparkling, so clear, that each star becomes...
...the glittering point of a great blue diamond.
Mewsette!
Hey, Mewsette!
What's the matter?
Are you deaf or something?
No. I am not deaf or something.
Come on, come on.
Read the poem.
Okay, okay.
You don't have to push.
A poem, dedicated to Mewsette.
To Mewsette, the prettiest cat
In all of France
All right, all right.
It's your poem.
Roses are red violets are blue
Here is a mouse from me to you
Signed, Jaune Tom.
Jaune Tom! You take that horrid, vulgar thing away from here this minute!
I've never been so insulted.
How dare you think that I would eat such a coarse, plebeian thing.
But...
- But cats like mice.
- Perhaps so.
- But I am not a cat, I'll have you know.
- You're not a...?
- You're not a cat?
- Not a cat?
I am a...
A... feline.
- A feline?
- You're a fe... What?
I think she means a female, Robespierre.
And all felines really like is champagne and champignons...
...and Champs Elysees...
And all I get on this farm is mice and milk!
I feel like a cabbage that's gone to seed. Like a fat duck!
Gosh, Mewsette, you're not as fat as a duck.
Oh, go away, you ple... Ple...
Plebeian peasant, you!
I never want to see you again.
I wish I were dead!
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo!
So do we.
Don't we, Jaune Tom?
Jaune Tom?
Jaune Tom?
Now look what you've done, you... You old feline, you!
Plebeians!
Well, if you don't like us "plebleens," why don't you go away with her?
I'll bet she just lives on "cham-pag-ne" and
"cham-pygmy-ons" and "champs-ulysses."
Why, Robespierre, that's a wonderful idea.
That's exactly what I'll do.
I'll go to Paris.
No more mice and milk for me!
Well, bon voyage, Mademoiselle Feline.
Au revoir, Robespierre!
Take good care of Jaune Tom!
What do you know?
She did it!
I must have a way with felines.
We're free! Free!
Free at last!
Well, you're a mouse.
You ought to know.
Why didn't she like you?
Did you ever have any trouble like that with your girl?
Oh. You are a girl.
Well, then tell me something from the girl's point of view.
What's wrong with me?
Jaune Tom! Jaune Tom!
- Where are you, Jaune Tom?
- Over here, Robespierre.
You can come on back now.
Everything's okay.
You mean Mewsette...?
Mewsette'll take the mouse?
No. She's left, Jaune Tom.
Took off.
- Nothing but fun now that Mewsette's gone.
- What do you mean she's gone?
- She just went away in a carriage.
- Carriage?
- What carriage?
- The one that took her to Paris.
- Well, why did she go to Paris?
- All felines go to Paris, I guess.
Come on, Jaune Tom.
Let's go mouse hunting.
Mewsette!
Hey. Wait for me!
Mewsette! Come back, Mewsette!
For the last time, my lad, if your friend arrived in that buggy...
...she has gone to Paris.
All right. I know that, but where's Paris?
What is Paris?
What is Paris?
- Are you mad?
- Is it a school or something for felines?
A school for felines?
- No? Well, a village, maybe?
- Yes.
That is what it is. A little village a mile or two up the tracks.
And now, if you don't mind,
I do have work to do.
Well, thanks a lot.
Jaune Tom! Jaune Tom!
- Pardon me, sir, but did you see...?
- He went thataway.
Gee, thanks. Jaune Tom!
Good morning, Jaune Tom.
Nighty-night.
I can hardly believe it!
I'm really on my way to Paris!
Delightful.
Delightful city, isn't it?
Oh, yes, sir.
Even more beautiful than
I dreamed it would be.
- First trip to Paris?
- Oh, yes.
- Visiting relatives?
- Oh, no.
I just up and decided that I'd vegetated too long on that dreary farm...
...and that every girl should see Paris and Jaune Tom is so dull...
...and I don't know anybody in Paris and it's all so wonderful...
Oh, but you must think I'm terribly bold to talk this way to a stranger.
Not at all. I think your enthusiasm is charming, and I'm not offended.
Oh, thank you.
I just know I'll be happy here.
Of course. But like any big city,
Paris has its pitfalls.
Oh, I realie that.
But after all, I'm...
I'm not exactly a kitten anymore.
I choose my friends very carefully.
And that's very wise, my dear.
Nevertheless, there are still a few unscrupulous characters about.
- Oh, dear me.
- You need a friend, a sponsor.
- Now, l...
- But that would hardly be proper, would it?
Mademoiselle! You cannot be inferring that I would suggest anything improper.
Oh, dear, no. Oh.
Please forgive me. It's just that...
I thought that my sister, one of the most influential cats in Paris...
...might be persuaded to take you under her wing.
Teach you all you need to know, introduce you to society.
But of course, if you would prefer to go it yourself...
...alone in a strange city, by all means.
- Oh, no, please.
- I would love to meet your sister.
- Then it is settled.
Come along, my dear.
Jaune Tom!
What are we doing down here,
Jaune Tom?
Let's go home before something happens to us.
I can't, Robespierre.
I have to find Mewsette.
Well, you look for Mewsette.
I'm gonna look for trains.
Is it much further to your sister's shop, monsieur?
No. It is just a little further along this street.
Yes. Here we are, my dear, the best in all Paris.
"Salon de Beaute Pour Felines.
Mme. Rubens-Chatte."
Meowrice, how nice to see you again.
- This is Mewsette, my dear sister.
- Isn't she pretty?
Any sister of Meowrice is a friend of mine.
Henrietta, you are my sister.
Sister!
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
She is an old dear but a little absent-minded.
Imagine, not even remembering your own brother!
- Yes.
- How silly of me.
Of course I'm his sister.
I've been his sister for years.
Mewsette is new to Paris, dear sister.
I have told her of your wonderful salon...
...where you will make her into the belle of all Paris.
- Of course, dear brother.
- Then she is all yours, Henrietta.
- You know what must be done.
- Now, look here, Meowrice.
It's going to take time and money to make a lady out of this cat.
So this time, I want something in advance.
Don't rush things, my dear.
Just remember, time is on the side of the scoundrel.
- And you are the king of the scoundrels.
- Yes.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have some business to attend to.
All right. Now listen carefully.
So I want one of you to keep an eye on that girl at all times.
Is that clear?
As they say,
"Evil is the root of all money."
Money trees, that is.
Big green money trees.
Gosh! We'll never find Paris in all those buildings and things.
- Yeah. There's a lot of them, all right.
- I told you it was a wild-goose chase.
- Come on. Let's go home.
- No, Robespierre.
- I can't go back without Mewsette.
- Well, I can.
So long, Jaune Tom.
I'm gonna miss you, Robespierre.
Take care of yourself.
Take care of myself?
Who's gonna take care of him?
Without me, no telling what'll happen to him.
Alone, friendless, far from home.
Well, don't just stand there.
Let's start looking.
Mewsette!
Mewsette!
Mewsette!
Mewsette!
- Quiet! Stop that noise!
- Go away, you silly little pussycats.
- Get away from here!
- Scram! Go on!
Leave those cats out of here!
Allez!
I don't know why she ever came to Paris.
I don't know why you ever came to Paris.
Your purr, my dear, it's like a cement mixer.
But that's the way I purred back home on the farm.
Well, it won't do here.
It must be refined, yet seductive.
Like this:
Now try again and put some throat into it.
Stop!
- Oh, stop!
- Oh, I'm sorry, Madame Rubens-Chatte.
Being sorry isn't enough.
Now, look, child.
We don't want to disappoint
Meowrice, do we?
- Oh, no. I'll try very hard this time.
- Good.
Now, let's show him how poised and gracefully...
...we walk with a bowl of milk on our head.
Now walk towards me.
Head erect.
Turn right. Left.
Reverse.
Oh, look out!
Oh, no.
I'm a failure. I'll never be a Parisian.
I'm going back home, back with the peasants...
...where I belong.
- No! No! Stop her! Stop her!
Stop her yourself.
My poor dear.
I know just how you feel.
Wouldn't you like to stroll on the boulevard, stop at a sidewalk cafe?
- And order Champs Elysees, just once.
- Of course, my pet.
Let us be gay.
We shall do the town.
- Do you feel better now, my dear?
- Oh, yes.
Those sidewalk cafes were so much fun.
And Paris is so beautiful!
And I feel so important riding in a buggy and...
Oh, good heavens, Meowrice.
What are they doing?
Oh, them? Why, they are kissing, chérie.
- What's kissing?
- Kissing?
Why, kissing is...
Like rubbing noses.
But do they only kiss in buggies?
Well, if you did away with buggies, you'd stop half the kissing in Paris.
How strange. Why is that?
Because, my naive one, there is nothing so romantic as a buggy ride.
- Here we are.
- Oh! So soon?
- Now, back to your lessons, my dear.
- Goodbye, Meowrice. And thank you!
How foolish I was.
I'll never think of that dull farm again.
I tell you, Jaune Tom, it's hopeless.
Absolutely hopeless.
- She's probably miles from here.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I suppose you're right, Robespierre.
- Well, come on then.
- Let's go back to the farm.
- Okay. Okay.
Now you're talking!
Robespierre, look!
Look what it says: "Felines"!
That's what Mewsette said she was.
I'll bet they'd know where she is.
Here we go again.
Jaune Tom!
Help, Jaune Tom!
Jaune Tom! Help!
- Who is it, dearie?
- There's no one here.
No one at all.
Help!
You know, Robespierre, we're seeing parts of Paris that the tourists usually miss.
Let's find our way out of here and get back to that feline place.
"Mr. Henry Phtt, 1411 Sand Box Road...
...Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A."
"Dear Mr. Phtt:
At long last, I have found a bride for you.
With proper schooling now underway...
...she will be the most beautiful and talented cat in the world.
I shall keep you informed of her progress.
Your obedient servant,
Meowrice Percy Beaucoup."
"P.S. I'm afraid that the price we agreed upon...
...must, under the circumstances, be doubled.
There are other suitors."
Well, I'm off to mail this letter.
If you ever decide to marry, boys, marry for love...
...of money.
Jaune Tom, you take that horrid, vulgar thing away from here this minute!
Pardon me, my friend, but that was the most remarkable exhibition...
...of "virtu-mouse-ity"
I've ever witnessed.
- Virtu-what-sity?
- Virtu-mouse-ity.
A little phrase I coined to describe the incredible proficiency...
...you just displayed in apprehending that rodent.
Obviously, it was too small.
Throwing it back was such a noble gesture.
It is an imposition, I know, but it would afford me great pleasure...
...if you would join me for a bite of dinner and perhaps a sip of...
We accept! We accept!
Name's Robespierre, manager of him...
...Jaune Tom, the world's greatest mouser.
And now can we eat?
It would seem to be out of our hands, monsieur.
What'll it be your pleasure you're having, s'il vous plait?
- Milk.
- Milk?
No, no. Let's really live it up big, Jaune Tom.
- Straight cream.
- No, no, messieurs.
On an occasion such as this, we drink champagne.
Champagne, garcon.
Champagne for the greatest mouse catcher in all France...
...and his manager.
One bottle of champagne, hot off the ice.
Hey, it's made out of bubbles.
I just wanna tell you...
...that you're all a wonderful bunch of gentlemen.
Everyone.
I saloosh...
Shaloot...
I salute you!
What a head.
What a head!
Here, what is this?
A turtle, perhaps?
A turtle with a hangover?
A two-headed turtle? Impossible.
Where are you going, turtle?
What do you know?
This is no turtle.
It's just a small, bloodshot kitten.
Oh, gently, gently, shipmate.
I won't harm your little friend.
You see, we three are all in the same boat.
The same boat.
That is pretty funny.
The same boat, no?
Say... No.
No, I guess not.
The truth is, we have been shanghaied, shipmates.
Or catnapped, in your case.
And that means we have to work.
Jaune Tom.
It's all right, Jaune Tom.
We'll get back all right.
Oh, it's such a big ocean, Robespierre, bigger than all France.
Bigger than the whole world.
Sure it is, but you've never given up hope yet.
I have now.
It's too big, Robespierre.
We'll never get back to find Mewsette.
It's not as big as you think, Jaune Tom.
Why, look.
It's just made up of little drops.
It's all how you look at it.
Honestly, Jaune Tom.
Jaune Tom?
There you are, shipmates.
I have good news!
We are headed for Alaska and the gold rush.
We will strike it rich, my friends.
Then we will return to Paris in style.
No time for games, little turtle.
The rain has stopped and I have work to do.
I must swab the deck, yes?
"Dear Mr. Phtt:
According to your instructions,
I am having Mewsette's portrait painted...
...by the most famous artists in Paris.
Many of them are not yet well-known in America...
...so please allow me to tell you a little bit about each one.
Claude Monet might well be said to be the father of the Impressionist movement.
You will notice how Monsieur Monet achieves a shimmering light...
...throughout the picture...
...and an impression of air and space.
A man of noble birth is
Monsieur Henri Toulouse-Lautrec...
...who is perhaps best known for his striking posters for the Moulin Rouge.
Pointillism is a highly individual style developed by Georges Seurat...
...in which he creates his astonishing effects...
...by the clever placing of tiny dots of paint...
...next to each other.
Henri Rousseau is an ex-soldier with no formal art training.
He is known as a 'primitive painter.'
With his vivid imagination...
...he is creating a charming world of his own...
...where oranges grow on banana trees.
Amedeo Modigliani is a talented young Italian painter...
...who shows great promise.
Sometimes his models have great difficulty holding the pose for him.
A Dutch painter who has found new inspiration here in Paris...
...is a man of violent temperament:
Vincent van Gogh.
To achieve a strong emotional impact...
...he sometimes applies paint directly from the tube.
Monsieur Edgar Degas frequently uses ballet dancers as his models.
To arrive at his delicate color harmonies...
...he often uses pastels instead of oil paints.
Don't be concerned when you see
Auguste Renoir's portrait.
Mewsette has not gotten fat.
Monsieur Paul Ceanne is an intellectual artist.
He is a masterful organier of color, composition and form.
His subjects often take on the aspects of a still life.
The dynamic Paul Gauguin has only recently returned from Tahiti...
...and his paintings show the influence of the South Sea Islands.
Another young painter here in Paris is a volatile Spaniard...
...who shows every indication of someday setting the art world afire.
His name is Pablo Picasso.
And so, hoping that you will enjoy them,
I ship these paintings on to you.
And tonight I am sending the original article:
Mewsette herself."
Here. Mail this letter, Armond.
Now, I want no slip-ups.
The train leaves at midnight.
I'll be back shortly with the belle of Paris.
I want you to see that she is comfortably settled in her...
...compartment.
I hope my little protegee is ready for her great adventure, sister.
She is, but you don't get her till I'm paid.
In full.
No money, no Mewsette.
Very well, then.
I'll write you a check.
- It's better than money.
- Now, that's more like it.
It will be well worth it, Meowrice.
Mewsette is my greatest achievement, my crowning glory.
For the sake of your dear neck,
I do hope so.
How gallantly you put your case, Meowrice.
No girl could resist you.
Judge for yourself whether you're getting your money's worth.
- Mewsette, chérie.
- Yes, dear Madame Rubens-Chatte?
- Why, brother. Don't tell me...?
- Momentary lapse, my dear.
Even cats are sometimes human.
Mewsette, my dear young friend, you are beautiful beyond compare.
Thank you, monsieur.
You are most kind.
Tonight I wish to speak to you of something very personal.
I think you will agree that before this night is over...
...all your dreams will come true.
Oh, Madame Rubens-Chatte, isn't it wonderful?
I do thank you for making it all possible.
Come, my dear. Paris awaits you.
And, dear madame, may I say everything that happens...
...is because of your faith in me?
I'll be back soon and tell you about it.
Don't wait up, sister.
It will be later than she thinks.
I'm going to miss that beautiful little thing.
Well, at least I've got this check to cheer me up.
What's happ...?
What's happening?
Why, that double-crosser! That crook!
He used disappearing ink.
Do you know, if the opportunity arose...
...to do him a disservice...
...I might not be able to resist it.
The moon is beautiful tonight, mon chérie.
Oh, yes. So romantic.
Step in here, my dear...
...out of the chill night wind.
What was it you wished to tell me, Meowrice?
Tonight I wish to speak of love and marriage.
You have thought of marriage, haven't you?
Yes, I...
- I suppose I have.
- Good.
Then I know just the one for you.
Here's his picture.
His name is Henry Phtt...
...of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
You mean you want me to marry this...
...fat, old...?
- You are as bright as you are pretty.
So please get into the basket...
...like a good little bride-to-be.
- Who are they?
- Business associates, chérie.
Just get into the basket, and you won't have to look at them anymore.
Into the basket?
No! Oh, no!
Yes! Oh, yes!
You are going to Pittsburgh to marry that rich American.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Isn't that why you left the farm?
Yes. I mean, no.
I just...
I just want Jaune Tom.
Jaune Tom? You mean the world's greatest mouser?
Why, old Jaune Tom's probably in Alaska about now.
He is not. You're lying...
...just like you did about everything else.
Call it a weakness.
Now get into the basket.
No! I won't!
I'm not going to marry anybody!
After her, boys!
Don't let her fall!
I have already paid the postage.
Come down from there,
Armond, you idiot.
No time for second-story work tonight.
Well, why didn't you say so, you epithet?
Well, do you see her?
Hurry. Hurry!
You fools. Don't you see those paw prints?
This should be easy.
Let's go.
She's not down here.
Back the other way!
There she goes!
Get rid of that dog, you bumbling idiots!
Your whiskers tickle, cats.
And since I can't stand to be tickled by no cats...
...I'm gonna tear your tails off and have them for breakfast.
We understand your feelings, sir.
Nothing like cats' tails for breakfast...
...but back there, among those barrels, is a...
No! Please!
Let's talk this over.
After all I've done for you.
Taught you everything I know...
...made you despicable scoundrels beyond compare.
And what happens? You meet one little dog and I, Meowrice...
...have to save your miserable, worthless lives.
Now, get out there and find Mewsette.
Brave country, is it not, mes amis?
This weather, she's a little nippy for cats.
You could call it "catnip weather."
Catnip weather, no?
No. Well, I am discouraged too.
We come for gold, we find cold.
I tell you what.
Let's join the Foreign Legion.
We go to Africa and get warm again, eh?
Mon dieu! Little turtle, look!
We've struck it rich!
Jaune Tom, we're rich!
We're rich!
Wow!
We're rich! Now we can go back.
Six weeks. Six whole weeks lost.
Never send kittens to do a cat's job, I always say.
And now that I'm getting these splints off my tail...
How are you, baby?
Good as new?
Now, then!
We are going out and find Mewsette...
...or there will be four new violins in the world.
Lovely view, eh, mademoiselle?
Oh, no! Please!
If there was any other way,
I would have waited, Jaune Tom.
Nice fielding, team.
Come along. We'll take the scenic route home.
The first thing we do is head for that
Madame what's her name's salon...
...and they're bound to know where she is.
Come on, let's go.
Don't worry, Jaune Tom,
I'm right behind you.
There it is.
- Where's Mewsette?
- She's in danger.
- Yes, I know, but...
- They've taken her to Meowrice's...
...and I think she's still there.
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah, thanks.
- Never mind the thanks.
Just give Meowrice my love and then turn him inside out.
Now, hurry. Hurry!
Canned fish?
What won't they think of next?
Everything is packaged these days.
Even pretty girls, hmm?
What?
Jaune Tom? The champion mouser?
At Madame Rubens-Chatte's?
Quick, then. We must be off to the train.
Grab the handles.
Put your backs into it.
Get moving, you idiots.
All right, lads, the coast is clear.
Let's go.
Mewsette.
Mewsette!
Mewsette, where are you?
Don't worry, Jaune Tom,
I'll be right there.
It's no use, Robespierre.
We're too late.
Nobody to...
...with?
Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Stop.
Look. There's a message.
"Jaune Tom, I'm being taken to the train."
Tears of gratitude, chérie?
Just think, in a few hours, you will be on a boat to America...
...and your new, old, rich husband.
Well, well, there are your little friends...
...down to bid you goodbye.
What are we gonna do?
I'm too pooped.
Au revoir, my children.
Don't forget to write.
Hey. Hey, maybe if I...
Maybe if I imagine...
Mewsette?
- Mewsette, where are you?
- Jaune Tom!
Good work, gentlemen.
Stop him, someone.
Toss him out the door, boys.
He ought to make quite a splash.
Jaune Tom, help!
They've got Robespierre!
Too late, my dear.
Are you all right, Mewsette?
You look all right.
I mean, at least your eyes do.
If you'll let me out now, Jaune Tom,
I'll show you how I really look.
Sure, sure.
What's the matter with me anyway?
It doesn't really matter, though.
Why, Jaune Tom, that's the nicest thing anybody ever said to me.
Jaune Tom, I've been such a fool.
Jaune Tom, look out!
You keep out of it, Robespierre.
Jaune Tom, hold it!
Stop.
"Mr. Henry Phtt.
1411 Sand Box Road."
Oh, yes.
Good idea, Robespierre.
Now, you go to beddy-bye, and when you wake up...
...you'll be on a boat going to meet that rich husband.
Right, Robespierre?
Please. Please don't say anything more. I'm dying.
I'm dying, I tell you!

Pop!
No. We ain't stopping the car again.
We don't wanna stop.
We want to know, are we good boys?
Yeah, yeah, you're good boys.
All right, Toby, give them a piece of candy.
Thank you.
It ain't even.
I know.
Now it is.
Yeah.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
You ain't gonna use that road, are you, Pop?
Why not?
Well, that sign says "closed to the public."
We ain't the public, we're part of the government.
They send me checks.
I keep them busy and happy.
We're dependent on each other.
We ain't the public, Toby.
Damn it, I lost my traction.
Don't get upset, Pa, I'll lift her off.
You'll do nothing of the kind.
You're getting $63.80 a month because the Army totally disabled your back.
Now, how's it gonna look if somebody comes along and you're lifting up an automobile?
My back don't feel totally disabled.
It don't matter how your back feels, it's what the Army doctor says that counts.
I keep telling you, Pop, they examined me right after my first judo lesson.
It was a little twisted up, but it twisted back the next lesson.
- Toby, we'll get out.
- That's okay.
Didn't twist your back again, did you, son?
No, sir, I just used mostly my hands.
Good. Good.
I wonder where the road goes.
It's hard to tell, just from looking at one end.
Hey,POP?
Yeah, Holly?
Listen, I've been taking notice.
We haven't passed a house or even a gas station the whole time we've been on this road.
Well, it stands to reason.
It's a brand new road.
The country ain't caught up with it yet.
Doesn't your gas gauge read "empty"?
When my gas gauge says "empty," it's still got three gallons left in it.
I can't understand it.
Where you going, son?
I'm gonna jog up the highway and get some gasoline.
You gonna do nothing of the kind.
Why not?
One of those government
Highway Patrol wagons is gonna come along here any minute.
Now, Pop, there won't be any patrolling if this road doesn't go anywhere.
And why wouldn't this road wanna go nowhere?
Maybe the government ran out of money before they could finish it.
How many times do I have to tell you that the government don't run out of money?
Only people run out of money.
Government's loaded.
Wake me up when that truck patrols by here.
All right, Pop.
Gee, Toby, it's gonna be getting dark in a couple of hours.
I don't see how we can prevent it.
I'm awful thirsty.
So are the children.
I'm sorry, Holly, but I don't happen to have any drinking water on me right now.
I wonder what's keeping that patrol car?
- Toby.
- Yeah?
We could dig for some.
Well, there's always what you call ground water, and it doesn't mix with the salt water so if you dig down to the water level, you can get the fresh.
Well, another thing
I don't have on me is a shovel.
Why, it's soft ground.
All you need is sort of a scoop or something.
There ought to be something around here we could use.
What about this?
No, not your pop's fender.
Oh, I'll put it back on before he wakes up.
TEDDY: I hit one.
- EDDY: You did not.
- I did so.
All right now, just keep throwing.
We need more coconuts.
Higher. Higher. That's good.
Higher. Higher.
EDDY: Hey, Pop, do you wanna try one?
POP: No, I don't wanna try one.
Keep hitting higher.
Here you go, Ariadne.
You're just as happy as a house cat, ain't you?
Women like doing things for other people.
Don't men ever feel like that?
What did I say that was so funny?
Oh, nothing.
I was just remembering, after your folks died, when Pop took you in.
What a skinny, scrawny little thing you were.
All eyes and elbows.
And now you're practically...
Well, like you said, practically a woman.
- Toby.
- Yeah?
Will you look at me?
Mmm-hmm.
No, I mean real good.
I know you're a woman, Holly.
And I know I said "practically," and that bothers you, don't it?
Yeah, well, I am 19 years old and I'm kind of well-built.
Yep, I know that, too.
And I'm glad of it.
- Are you, Toby?
- Uh-huh.
'Cause I'm trying not to notice things like that and you're a good one to practice not noticing on.
Well, why me, and, well, what's wrong with noticing girls?
Well, that's how they catch you.
Pop told me all about it the day I got sent home from band practice for grabbing Amy Plotka.
Do you remember Amy?
Yeah, I remember Amy.
You know anything about sex, Holly?
Of course I do.
Who told you?
I don't remember.
Never you mind.
You've been living with us since you was 13.
You know about it then?
Oh, Toby, leave me alone.
I'm sorry, honey,
I didn't aim to make you mad.
I was just trying to explain what you asked me.
Well, then explain.
Don't ask questions.
Well, it's just like Pop said, women are natural nesters.
Just look at the way you took to nesting right here.
Cooking dinner and everything, starting from scratch.
Well, I would dearly love to know what's so awful about nesting?
It's just being married and having a house.
Well, nothing.
Except doing it when you don't want to.
I think a man ought to be allowed to wait till he wants to.
Women don't aim to let you wait.
That's why I use my education against them.
Your education?
Multiplication tables.
Anytime some pretty gal is standing around bothering me
I just close my eyes and I say, one times one is one, and one times two is two and right on through the eights.
Most times I only have to get to the sixes and they get disgusted and go away.
I can imagine.
Of course it don't do much good if they hang on through the eights
'cause I forget the nineses.
That's what happened that night behind the bowling alley with Gertrude.
I forgot the nineses.
1 ob'! , when you say that you wanna wait, do you want to?
Does that mean that you don't wanna fall in love?
Doesn't everybody wanna fall in love?
Not me.
Notjudging from the kind of love
I've seen people fall into.
Pop had a song that explained it pretty well.
Let me see, how did that thing go?
Show me a girl with a dimple on her cheek
Butter melts in her mouth
When she opens it to speak
Show me a girl who is acting so refined
And I'll show you a girl
With one thing on her mind
So I say, "You know what?"
She says, "What?" I say, "What?"
"Oh, I'm not the marrying kind
"For you've got what it takes
"And it takes what you've got
"But I'm not the marrying kind
"Don't kiss me, don't claw me
"Don't pet me, don't paw me
"I won't leave my freedom behind"
So I say, "You know what?"
She says, "What?" I say, "What?"
"Oh, I'm not the marrying kind
"You know what?"
She says "What?" I say, "What? Thanks a lot
"But I'm not the marrying kind
"Don't kiss me, don't claw me
"Don't pet me, don't paw me
"And I won't leave my freedom behind"
So I say, "You know what?"
She says, "What?" I say, "What?"
"Oh, I'm not the marrying kind
"I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
"And now you've got what I'm not
"I'm not the marrying kind
"Oh, I'm not the marrying kind
"Oh, I'm not the marrying kind"
Come on, Ariadne.
The governor is scheduled to start from the Coast Highway at 11:00.
I'd hate to miss the dedication.
You certainly got a right to be mighty proud of this project, Mr. King.
Not a tin can or a gum wrapper along the whole 30 miles.
Stop. Stop, quick!
What in the name of...
What's going on here?
I reckon you're from the government and I will say it's about time.
I am the State Supervisor of Highways and I wanna know what you're doing here?
You see, we ran out of gas here on this road.
Don't give me that stuff.
You've been camping here.
Well, we couldn't camp nowhere else, because this is where we ran out of gas.
I think you're within 50 feet of the center line of that road.
That means that legally speaking, you're on the thoroughfare.
You could be arrested for obstructing traffic.
I don't see any jam up here.
That doesn't matter.
You can't just camp on a public thoroughfare as if you owned it.
The way you're talking about it, you'd think you owned it.
I am ordering you to pack yourjunk in that jalopy and clear out.
On foot, huh?
You claim you're out of gas, do you?
Yes, sir.
And I'm mighty near out of patience with this kind of government.
Joe, break out that spare can of gas.
I want your name and address.
You're gonna be billed for it.
We're the Kwimpers from Cranberry County, just over the state line.
Just care of the county, they always know where to find us.
You're his son?
That's right.
And she is your wife and those are your children?
No, sir. Me and Pop, we're the Kwimpers.
Teddy and Eddy, sitting over there on that car, they're some sort of fourth cousins or something.
After their folks died, we just sort of took them in.
They don't cost us much, though, on account of we collect aid for dependent children.
That teenager there, she's Holly Jones.
She used to be our babysitter.
Her folks got killed in an auto accident.
She just stayed with us ever since.
And that little girl, she was orphaned just last year.
She's just three years old and her name's Ariadne.
All right, all right.
You're a self-appointed orphanage.
Now, will you kindly get this mess loaded?
Yes, sir. I was just trying to...
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
He can't load nothing.
He's on total disability for a bad back.
- Oh, Pop.
- Total disability?
What do you collect?
Unemployment compensation?
Well, relief is a...
Lately, he's been favoring relief.
All wards of the government?
Well, look here, in 15 minutes the Governor of this state is gonna drive along this road and dedicate it.
And he's not going to be looking at any mess like this.
Yes, sir.
I don't know why
I should explain anything to you.
But this road...
This road is part of a big public betterment program.
Over there, we'll have a bird sanctuary.
- That'll be nice.
- Yeah.
Back there, a wildlife preserve.
That'll be nice, too.
JOE: Mr. King, here come a bunch of cars, it must be the governor.
Oh, no! He's early.
Well, I got the gasoline.
Never mind about the gas, let's get this place cleaned up.
Just a moment.
You must be insane.
You said yourself, the public thoroughfare is 50 feet from the center line.
Well, the 50 feet ends right there.
Teddy and Eddyjust measured it.
- Right, boys?
- BOTH: Right!
Back! Back! Back!
What's it matter where it ends?
This is State property, you idiot.
This is private property.
Oh, no. He's stopping.
Mr. King, what seems to be the trouble here?
Governor, Your Excellency, I'm very sorry, but these people are obstructing a public thoroughfare.
We'll get rid of them right away,
Your Excellency.
Trooper... Sergeant, arrest these people.
- Good morning, Governor.
- Yes, sir.
Morning, sir. Mr. Governor, if you appointed this man
I think it best you get out of the car right now and put him straight.
A man like you has got to know the law, and it's on the record now.
You'll witness his violation of a citizen's rights.
Are you a student of the law, sir?
A student? Why...
Well, I know that the police can't come on private property unless they's got a warrant or is chasing people.
Now, nobody can chase us.
On account of we ain't running.
So it's best they get off that private property, right, Governor? Right?
- Well...
- Sir, it's not private property, it's filled land.
Put there by the Highway Division.
Well, you know what the law states about homesteading, don't you, Governor?
Well, we're homesteading from the end of the thoroughfare to the edge of the river.
Oh, homesteaders, eh?
Homesteaders!
Any public land can be homesteaded, can't it?
Yes, sir. If they put up a roof and stay on it for six months, they own it.
The boy's right, Governor.
Well, there's the roof.
They're on private property.
Would you get back a mite?
- They're trespassing.
- All right, officers, get off.
Respect private property at all times, gentlemen, that's the law.
Well, justice has been rendered.
I'll see you later, Mr. King.
Let's move along.
- Take care of yourself, Governor.
- Thank you, sir.
Nice parade.
He's a nice fellow.
Give three cheers for Pop.
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!
Stop that, you brats.
- Brats.
- Who you calling brats?
I'll take care of it.
Run along and play, kids.
You gonna stand on our property and you're gonna give orders like you're entitled to?
That's a good idea.
Play it up while you've got the chance.
Oh, yes, there's a homestead law, and you've taken good advantage of it.
But there's other laws, Kwimper, laws that might cause you a lot of unpleasantness.
Such as? Go ahead, quote them.
One, for instance, provides that none of you receive any more welfare benefits from your home state.
You're residents here now.
I shall so notify the proper authorities.
Pop.
Pop, do you want me to throw this fellow off our property?
No, no, no, just leave him be.
We'll listen and we'll learn.
Learn this, too, then.
That well is probably unhygienic.
That lean-to doesn't conform to any zoning restriction I know of.
Kwimper, I am proud of my job and of my responsibility to the people.
I owe them my best efforts to run your sort out of this area.
You'll be hearing from me shortly.
Come along, Joe.
Funny thing.
I was just about to give him back his land when he turned nasty.
Now, I don't know what to do.
Pop, didn't you mean what you said about homesteading and all?
But, damn it, I ought to stay here.
But it's an awful lot of botherjust to take that uppity hyena down a peg.
- I gotta think it over, Tob.
- Well, Pop...
I gotta think it over, Tob.
Toby. Cross your fingers and pray.
Pray for what, Holly?
To homestead!
To stay here.
To stay here for always.
Why, that don't make a bit of sense to me.
What's wrong with our own home?
After Gertrude Patterson leaves, that is.
Well, it's not our home, it's your home.
But if we built a place here, it would really be part mine, and not just a place
I was allowed to move into.
Be my first real home.
I'm sorry, Toby, if that sounds ungrateful.
That's natural, honey,
I mean, women are just natural nesters, just like Pop said.
Toby, a body would think a grown man could make up his own mind about things.
Well, I agree with you there.
I kind of like to make my own decisions, too, but I usually wind up doing what Pop wants anyway.
Don't you understand that I wanna stay?
I wanna stay so much.
I didn't realize it meant that much to you, honey.
Just don't get upset about it. I'll fix it.
How?
You mean, you haven't learnt how to handle a contrary man like Pop yet?
Watch this. Hey, Pop!
Pop!
Huh? Huh? Huh?
We'd better get out of here.
Who says?
That King fellow is gonna make an awful lot of trouble.
I'll break him off like a dry twig.
Well, maybe so, maybe not.
No maybe about it.
Well, it's just that me and Holly here, we don't think you can handle a man as big and powerful as a highway supervisor.
Well, that settles it.
We're staying.
We're homesteading.
We ain't leaving here until I say so.
But, Pop, why, how can we possibly manage?
How will we manage?
That's my department.
I'll take care of the brainwork.
You young folks, you take care of the work work.
Toby...
Toby, I could kiss you for that.
One times one is one.
One times two is two...
Wow! That's a monster.
Is it good to eat?
We ain't never gonna know.
He's too big to handle for this gear.
What do you got there, a tarpon?
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's a whopper.
He's too big to catch with a diaper pin.
I'm trying to get rid of him just as much as he's trying to get rid of me.
Trying to get rid of him?
I've been paying $65 a day for charter boats and never hooked one like that.
I'd give $20 to play him.
Well, you're mighty welcome, sir.
Well, thank you.
Just try not to lose the diaper pin if you can help it.
No.
Whoa.
Excuse me, sir.
Hey, POP-
Hi, son.
- Get all the shopping done?
- I think so.
Did you have enough money for everything?
Yep, and a couple of luxury items, too.
I went to a junkyard and I bought us a john.
Ain't it a lover?
It sure is, Pop.
I bought some cheap lumber, too.
I'm gonna build it its own little house.
Is that a telegram, Pop?
Yeah, from the government back home.
That King fellow didn't waste no time getting us cutoff.
Well, don't you worry, Pop.
We'll manage.
Ain't nobody can fret a family got its own private john. Nobody.
Need some help, sir?
No, thanks.
- He's putting up a pretty good fight.
-(LAUGHING) Yeah.
Did you hurt yourself?
Are you all right?
(LAUGHING) I'm fine.
I've never had so much fun in my life.
I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself.
Did you see the size of that one?
The hook straightened out.
It wasn't much of a hook though, it was just a diaper pin, that's all it was.
A diaper pin, a pole, and a piece of string, and I had more action than with $1,000 worth of equipment.
Oh. Nope. Here's your $20.
No, I couldn't take that.
All I done was lend you a fish and it was a public fish anyway.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, Holly, I can bend this back into a hook again.
I'm with you, sister.
Money's like a fish.
Anytime you can hook it, you hook it.
I'll be back.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, I know what you're thinking, Toby.
It's a shame to take money from a crazy man.
We need this, and...
And the way he talked, he had plenty.
Imagine paying money to fish.
Here. It's yours.
No, give it to Pop.
ENDICOTT: So long.
Bye.
Holly.
Did you hear what that fellow said about paying $65 a dayjust to fish?
Yeah.
Kind of funny, ain't it?
All the fish out here you want for free.
The bait's free, hooks don't cost much.
You've given me an idea.
I have?
Oh, such a wonderful idea.
Oh, Toby, you're gonna be proud of me.
Sure you don't need anything else?
Nope, this is just fine.
Now, really, there are fish out there by the millions.
Thanks for the information.
I'll pass it along.
- You do that. Bye.
- Bye.
MAN: Oh, it's a big one, ain't it?
You've got a beauty there, miss.
There's a beauty if I ever saw one.
Wish you had caught that, huh?
Anybody want any more coffee?
Two cups, one with, one without.
One with and one without.
Throw in a couple of donuts, please.
Couple of donuts.
More wood, Teddy.
Yeah, Pop.
TOBY: $89, $90,
- Is she asleep?
- Mmm-hmm.
$92, Pop.
Well, that's fine for one day, son.
That's what comes of sticking up for your rights.
Not running like a scalded dog, the way you wanted me to.
Oh, you was right, Pop.
I was wrong.
You know, we'd better start a bank account.
I've had nothing to do with no banks,
I ain't gonna start now.
Now, Pop, banks pay interest and you double your money before you...
But I hate them.
Don't you, Toby?
I never even seen the inside of a bank.
I don't aim to.
I mean, I'm gonna make a few improvements.
Lots, Pop.
What we first need is a line of pilings offshore.
We do?
So we can build a dock.
A dock?
Let me handle this, Pop,
I understand her a little better than you do.
Now, what do we need a dock for, honey?
Silly, so we can tie up our rowboats.
Oh, rowboats.
We need a rowboat so we can row out to our yacht, Pop.
Else how can we get out to that island where our hotel is?
Now, will you two stop that?
I mean this.
We need rowboats so we can rent them out to our fishing parties.
Right now, our customers are fishing off of that bridge and it belongs to the state highway.
Now how long is it before that Mr. King is gonna put a stop to it?
- Be damned, but she's right.
- She is?
Well, of course I am.
So I talked to some folks, and it figures out we can get some used rowboats, build a dock, and have a real fishing place for about $2,000.
POP: $2,000?
TOBY: You done busted a bubble, honey.
No, I've been asking around.
There's a very good chance we can borrow the money from the bank.
Well, that would sure change my opinion about banks.
You mean they'll lend you the moneyjust for the asking of it?
And the interest.
You gotta pay them back a little more than they pay out.
Oh!
That's how they do it.
Yeah, Pop.
Well, will you go?
Will you go to the bank and borrow $2,000?
Well, if it's that easy, let Toby do it.
You mean me?
Holy Ike, here I am dealing with banks, got my own fleet of rowboats, my own docks, all because I wouldn't let some government man tell me where I could stand and where I couldn't.
It seems there's a lot of money in not doing what you're told, Pop.
Yes, sir. Teddy, Eddy, let that learn you.
If you want to get along in life, never do what you're told.
Oh, for heaven's sakes, don't tell them a thing like that.
It ain't no wronger than telling them they always gotta take orders.
Some folks tell you what to do
They think they know more than you
They insist that they're giving sound advice
But as sure as you're living
It ain't sound, it ain't nice
It just doesn't sound like sound advice
Some folks like to be the boss
They get up on their high horse
Oh, they say that you're getting sound advice
There's one thing I'm betting
it ain't wise, it ain't nice
You won't like the sound of their advice
Sound advice we're given, sound advice
Just as sure as you're living
If you're smart, you'll think twice
When they start to sound off with advice
Don't listen to their sound advice
Toby, 15 minutes left.
Kind of like a church, ain't it?
Yeah.
What they got them poor fellows locked up for?
(CHUCKUNG)No
They're tellers.
They cash checks, and make change and things like that.
Oh, do they do the lending, too?
Well, I suppose so.
No, no, there.
Through the glass door.
Now, Toby, you make sure and don't forget to tell them that we grossed $92 on Sunday.
And that you were in the Army.
That's for character reference.
Okay? Now, go on.
Hey, ain't you coming with me?
No, I can't go in. I'm not dressed.
You don't look no crummier than I do.
Well, now it's different for a man.
Now, you go on, Toby.
I'll be standing here, praying.
Anything I can do for you?
No, I don't believe I have any use for a policeman right now, thank you.
All right.
- Oh. Pardon me, please.
- Oh, yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
What do you want?
Money.
(SHUDDERING) Money?
There's nothing to be afraid of, in fact, I'm just as scared as you are.
What's that you're saying?
- You're feeling sick, huh?
- Yeah.
Help, help.
You look like you need help.
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
- Get your hands up.
- Who, me?
Come on, get them up!
And drop this fellow on the floor?
He's got a hostage.
Open that dang door, will you?
He says open this door.
Get him before he can go for his gun!
Watch out we don't hit Mr. Binkley.
This man's in bad shape, and he ain't gonna get no better if you fellows don't do what I say.
One of you better call him an ambulance.
Hold it right there or I'll blow your head off.
Well, the way you're waving that thing around, you're likely to hit most anybody.
And you better put yours down, too.
Thank you.
Well, why don't somebody get him a doctor?
GUARD: Watch out, Mr. Endicott, he's got a gun.
Hello, Toby.
Are you holding up this bank?
No, sir. ls somebody holding it up?
Where did you get that gun?
I took it away from him.
He was over there waving it around, he might shoot somebody.
Bet it's even loaded.
Let me have it, please.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
Now, what have you done to George?
Nothing. I just picked him up. He fainted.
Are you all right, sir?
I don't know, I...
Who are you?
A friend of mine.
He runs that fishing place out on the new highway.
Oh, well, I'm sorry. lthoughtyouu.
All right, guard, open up the doors, please.
It's all right, folks.
Nothing to be frightened about.
Just a mistake, everything will be all right.
Toby, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right, Holly.
I'm all right.
Hello, Mr. Endicott.
Hello, dear.
Well, maybe you can tell me what this is all about?
I don't know. ltjust seemed to happen all at once.
Well, Mr. Binkley yelled for help and...
No, I didn't.
George, remember you're a vice president.
Please get off the depositors' table.
Well, I didn't yell for help.
Toby did.
Well, I thought he was sick.
This man broke into the bank vault...
I understand, guard.
Here's your gun.
Just go about your business.
Yes, sir.
Well, let's get down to fundamentals.
Now, young lady, what are you and this gentleman doing in our little bank?
We want to borrow $2,000.
Please.
Well, you went to the right person.
George here is our loan officer.
Could we have the money right now, sir?
You see, the parking meter is running outside...
Well, Toby, we don't do things quite that fast here.
Why don't we come to my office?
I think George needs to sit down.
Well, come along.
Come along, George.
So if we can get the dock and the boats and the outboard motors, we could rent them, make a lot of money, and build a house.
Well, George here is the man you're gonna have to convince.
You frightened him to death, now it's his turn to frighten you.
Mr. Kwimper, the bank must have security, well, that is to say that we have to be sure that we'll get our money back.
Now, this is Mrs. Kwimper?
Oh, no, sir. She just lives with me.
Oh.
Well, I didn't mean to pry.
I think you're getting the wrong impression, George.
How long have you lived with the Kwimpers?
Since I've been about 13.
Toby's Pop took me in for the same reason he took in
Ariadne and the twins.
We had no place to go.
Get the picture, George?
Oh, thank you.
Yes. Yes, sir.
Now, this land that you're living on, well, is it mortgaged?
I don't know, sir.
We don't own it.
We're homesteading.
Well, we can't very well lend you money on property you don't own yet.
Well, we own ourjohn.
I didn't quite catch that.
Ourjohn, and I guess we own the house that we built for it, too.
Yes. Well, let's move on here, shall we?
Now, how about your car?
Well, that car means an awful lot to Pop even though it only cost $50.
Besides, it's got fried hubcaps.
Of course.
Well, George, you've got to admit he's been giving you honest answers, not cagey ones, but honest.
A week ago he refused to take $20 for a public fish.
That's very commendable.
I think that... How is that?
It doesn't really matter.
I happen to have a very high opinion of honesty.
Well, yes, sir, of course.
But is it security?
It just might be that this is the only real security there is.
Well, sir, I became a vice president of this bank because I made it a habit never to contradict the boss.
This bank is about to lend you $2,000.
We're very grateful, sir, but I don't want to try to fool anybody.
Now that car of Pop's is in a terrible mess.
It doesn't matter, Toby.
What we're making is known as a character loan.
We do it now and then, but not often enough for the good of our souls.
Don't you agree, George?
Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. Yes, sir.
Well, nice having done business with you, Toby.
Thank you, Mr. Endicott.
- And you, Holly.
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh, Mr. King.
- Yes?
Miss Claypoole's office just called.
She has your memo and she can see you now.
Good. Call her back and tell her I'll be right there.
Yes, sir.
Well, I gather you don't think highly of these Kwimper people.
You gather good.
They sound half hillbilly, half hobo to me.
With a tincture of Bowery burn and possibly wino.
Well, Arthur, if this memo of yours is correct, this is a case for the police, not for Social Welfare.
Does the memo imply they've broken the law?
I don't recall making any such statement.
Well, it says, "A social contagion that aims its poison of indifference
"and sloth at the soul of our social structure."
Well, is that funny?
No.
Sorry, Arthur, you do get a bit stuffy when you get angry.
Yes, Alisha, when a few parasitic individuals set themselves above the interests of six million taxpayers, I get angry, and stuffy, and determined!
Well, if these people are what you represent, the State Welfare can make them want to be someplace else.
But I'm afraid I can't take your word for it,
I'll have to interview them.
Alisha, how dare you imply
I'd misrepresent this situation?
Arthur, keep your shirt on.
You've already admitted you were angry.
Now what Welfare Officer would take the recommendations of an angry man, hmm?
And remember,
I didn't take this job for livelihood.
I enjoy my work.
I must say, interviewing the Kwimpers does look like a lot of fun.
Good morning, Holly.
Good morning, folks.
Did you get my yarn I needed?
Yeah, I'll bring it over in a few minutes.
Pop, Toby, it's last Sunday's.
The man at the fishing tackle place saved it for me.
Now, listen,
"New Bay Development
Open to Homesteading.
"New Enterprise to Cater for Fishing Parties.
"The exact status at this newly created bay development
"is a bit of a puzzle.
"It cannot be restricted by municipal or county ordinances
"as it lies outside theirjurisdiction."
Now, hold on, Holly, you're turning my head with talking so fast...
But, Toby...
Son, that means that the city or the county ain't got no say over us.
Even their police can't come in here and tell us what to do.
That's why we got a lot of neighbors.
See, folks can take so much government, then they gotta bust out and go where there ain't none.
Understand, son?
(STUTTERING) I think so, Pop, I...
It's kind of funny, all them fellows living in one trailer, ain't it?
Ain't no business of ours.
Too much pressure.
- Too much pressure.
- Yep.
You know, maybe we should pay them a call, huh?
Sounds to me like they got enough callers.
Well, I just don't feel right acting standoffish to neighbors.
Suit yourself, Holly.
Toby, come on with me.
I'll take them some coffee.
Don't wanna go empty-handed.
It's your move, Pop.
I know it, son.
Here, it's nice and fresh.
MAN: All right, punk, where do you think you're going?
- MAN 1: Hold it right there.
- Give me that.
TOBY: Watch it, you'll make me spill it.
MAN 1: What do you got there?
Hey, look at the popsie.
She's got a knife on her.
Give me that.
What is this?
This punk threw acid on my hand.
You'd better watch it, Carmine, that dame, she slashed me with a knife.
I never did anything of the kind.
All right, hold it you two.
Put a flash on them.
Look, we're just trying to be neighborly.
I'm sorry you fellows got hurt, but you done it to yourselves.
A pot of coffee and a can opener.
A couple of great muscle men you are.
Holly here made you some coffee.
Would you like to try some?
Sure thing.
You two must be from next door.
Yeah, glad to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.
Would you like to come inside, meet my partner, Nick?
If you put some butter on it, it'll take the sting out of it.
- Come on in.
- Thanks.
What's that?
What's what?
Well, Holly ain't never been nowhere.
That's a pool table, honey.
First one I ever seen without pockets, though.
Yeah, well, you just cover the bet and make yourself some easy money, Sam.
What did you do, send out for something?
No, Nick, these people are from next door.
They brought us some coffee.
Coffee? What for?
You drink it.
Is he kidding?
I don't think so. He's like that.
Well, Toby and I just like to be neighborly, that's all.
Sure, do you want me to pour you a cup?
No, no, no, bud, look, we're not neighbors.
This is a floating game, see?
We just stick around in one place until it gets too hot.
Then we move along. Get it?
Oh, sure. Well, they tell me it don't get hot around here till about the middle of July.
He is like that, ain't he?
No, you see, it gets hot for us anyplace we go after a couple of days.
Well, if it gets hot anyplace, what did you come here for?
Well, it was on the way.
Oh, then you're not just running away from the government.
What was that?
Well, Toby thinks maybe you saw that piece in the paper about there being no government.
No, what kind of government?
Well, it said that the State built this here land and the county ain't got no say-so over it, the city neither.
Hey, could this be on the level?
You know, it sounds screwy enough, it could be kosher.
That's what it sounds like to me.
Oh, baby, this kind of a chance comes along once in a lifetime.
Carmine, you know this could turn out to be an East Coast Las Vegas.
Oh, you mean because there's no police here?
Now you're digging it, little lady.
Yes, but what about after we file?
- File what?
- Our claim.
Once we've lived here for six months, we can claim the land.
Pop says that it'll be part of the county then.
Well, this land claiming idea don't sound too good.
Now, I bet it would if Pop explained it to you.
Yeah, well, where is he?
In that woodpile next door?
Well, he wasn't in the woodpile when we left. He was...
Well, let's visit him anyway.
After you, please.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, baby, is this a sweet deal?
Carmine, nobody's gonna mess it up.
You're not planning any rough stuff?
We do it nice if we can.
Now, your kid here tells me you're gonna put in a claim for this land?
That's about the size of it.
Well, that would be a big mistake.
Bring the cops here.
Right nice of you to warn us but I know all about it.
Well, I like to do things nice if I can.
Now there's $2,000.
Carmine and me want to buy your place.
Oh, no, you can't...
We ain't gonna sell.
We got $2,000 in this without counting the brainwork.
All right, I'll make it $5,000 and the government will give you capital gains.
Don't mention the government to me.
I tried to help the government out with everything they wanted to do.
With relief, with compensation, with disability.
They cut me off.
Well, if that's the way they feel about it, don't mention the government to me.
He's your father?
That's my POP-
Sure, that figures.
All right, I'll go a little higher, but don't push it too high.
Well, if Pop says we don't sell, we don't sell.
You don't sell?
Well, I tried to do it nice.
There it is, Alisha.
A perfect example of how a tenement slum commences.
Which one is the Kwimper's?
The hideosity with the dock.
What about the rest of the homesteaders, you plan to get rid of those, too?
I certainly am. One way or another, once you've got rid of the Kwimpers.
How long will it take you?
Well, Arthur, it's not going to be any quick thing.
The State Welfare requires a complete list of interviews with everybody concerned.
Very well. Start interviewing.
How long has he been here?
It doesn't matter.
He's got the IQ of a grasshopper.
Well, with those shoulders, he sure looks like a genius to me.
Introduce me, Arthur.
Kwimper, this is Miss Alisha Claypoole.
She is our State Welfare supervisor.
- Oh, how do, ma'am?
- Oh, stay right where you are.
- You can go now, Arthur.
-But...
Thank you, Arthur.
Hmm.
- What's your first name?
- Toby.
Mine's Alisha.
- Well, how do, Alisha?
- Oh, please relax.
Did you understand what Arthur King meant when he mentioned your IQ?
I reckon he meant I'm not smart.
I hope he didn't hurt your feelings.
No, ma'am.
There's a couple of things I am smart about, and one of them's not letting my feelings get hurt easy.
That's smart. That's even wise.
Anybody ever tell you you're very handsome?
Only girls.
Don't you like girls?
I like girls all right, except when they start to bother me.
A young, virile man like you,
I should think you'd love to be bothered.
Well, the bothering part is all right, but I ain't gonna marry no girl and build no house just so I can be bothered regular.
Flight from paternity.
Oedipus is everywhere.
I beg your pardon, ma'am?
Nothing.
You know, Toby, that the State Welfare Department is deeply interested in you.
How come?
'Cause you're a very interesting man.
I am?
You have exquisite proportions, why, your legs are amazing...
That tickles, ma'am. That tickles.
That's because I hit a very sensitive nerve that...
If you have finished tickling Toby's leg,
I'd like him to do a chore.
Who would this be?
That's Holly.
Hello, Holly.
Say "how do you do" to Alisha.
A member of the Kwimper family?
Oh, Holly's practically a sister to me.
What does practically mean?
We're not related.
Alisha here is a State Welfare supervisor.
That's lucky.
Somebody's welfare around here needs supervising.
Come and help me fill the water barrel.
I just filled it last night.
Well, it fell over.
I think the twins must have pushed it.
Look, that barrel weighs
200 or 300 pounds, Holly.
The twins couldn't have turned it over.
Maybe they had a little help.
I'll fill it for you later, honey.
Much later.
Right now,
Alisha's got to figure out my welfare.
I've never seen Holly look so upset.
She must be awful thirsty.
Toby, look at me.
You know, total naivetÃ© is a hard thing to believe.
But I believe it.
What did you say, ma'am?
Never mind, it's a compliment.
Oh. Thank you.
I'll give you one, just as soon as I can make one up.
Can't you think of a compliment without making it up?
Well...
Try.
Try real hard.
MAN: Hey, Toby, how are the fish running today?
You ain't got your mind on work, though, have you?
This is about as private as a subway.
Come with me.
I ain't got any secrets.
Well, we just can't have a good interview with people intruding.
Oh.
You comfortable?
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, I see.
You need another pillow?
No, this is fine, thank you.
Well, Toby,
I need to know my subject inside out, every intimate detail in order to prescribe help.
I didn't know you was fixing to help me.
Seeing you're friends to Mr. King and all.
Oh, don't worry about Arthur King.
State Welfare wants to help you.
That's what the word
"welfare" means, isn't it?
Yes, ma'am. I never said it didn't.
Well, let's start with the word association test.
I'll say a word and you say the first word that pops into your head.
Well, wouldn't it be safer if I give it a little thought, first?
No, this is a test to probe your subconscious.
We all know our motives on the conscious level and those are the ones we often try to conceal.
Now, if you answer me right away,
I'll know the motives you're trying to conceal.
And I'll know the real reasons for the things you do and say.
Oh.
Now, I got to think about that a little bit.
Are you ready?
Yep. Should I stand up?
Oh, no, no, just relax.
Now, first word, hurt.
Ow.
Well, I don't think that's a word.
Doesn't matter.
Second word. Ready?
- Help.
_"Helpll?
No, Toby, you don't repeat the word, you just say what the word suggests to you.
Nobody yells "help."
They always yell "help, help."
So I was waiting for the other "help," and when you didn't say "help," well, I said "help."
I see.
This isn't going to be quite as easy as I expected.
Now, the third word.
Steal.
Home.
Oh, you poor boy. You think somebody's trying to steal your home.
Willie Mays stole home.
Who's Willie May?
Not May, Mays. He's a baseball player.
Oh, never mind.
The association speaks for itself.
Now, number four.
Girl.
Dad.
Holy Moses.
Something wrong?
Toby, I'll just have to ask you to explain that one for me.
That's the song they're playing.
On top of Old Smoky
Where things get real hot
Where girls are a problem
Which Dad knows I've got
That's pretty good, sing some more.
Follow that dream
I've got to follow that
Keep a-moving, move along
Keep a-moving
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I gotta follow that dream to find the love I need
When your heart gets restless
Time to move along
When your heart gets weary
Time to sing a song
But when a dream is calling you
There's just one thing that you can do
You've gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
You gotta follow that dream to find the love you need
Keep a-moving, move along
Keep a-moving
Got to find me someone whose heart is free
Someone to look for my dream with me
And when I find her, I may find out
That's what my dreams are all about
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need
Keep a-moving, move along
Keep a-moving, move along
Keep a-moving, move along
Keep a-moving, move along
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Any more words?
Yes. Love.
Thirty.
You think love begins at 30?
No, ma'am.
Love is when you ain't got any.
Any what?
Any points. Like in tennis.
Love-15, love-30, love-40.
Maybe I should've said love-15, but it ain't what I thought of.
That's all right.
I just misunderstood you.
Now the last word.
Sex.
One times one is one, one times two is two, one times three is three...
Fascinating answer. Fascinating.
Did I pass the test?
What you just did spontaneously was express the realization that with one person, or one of any species, sex is a sterile thing.
That can't produce more than the original number that it started with.
But as soon as there are two, it becomes productive.
Yes, ma'am. And that's something you have to watch out for.
Toby, don't spoil the poetry of it.
Oh, well, that's enough work for this afternoon.
Let's just lie back and enjoy the afternoon sun.
Do you like me like this, Toby?
You're awful close.
Toby, just put your arm around me and do whatever you think of, just like you did in the test.
I didn't know the government gave this kind of test.
Toby.
Now.
One times one is one, one times two is two, one times three is three, one times four is four...
HOLLY: Toby!
Toby, where are you?
That's the end.
No, that's Holly.
Toby, you've gotta come home right away.
What happened?
Somebody opened the bait box.
Now, who'd do a fool thing like that?
Holly and I know, don't we, Holly?
Well, come on, we've got customers waiting.
Okay. How did you happen to find us, Holly?
Well, I just saw you turn off the highway and I followed the dirt road till the tire tracks stopped.
Smart girl. Good tracking.
Just like an Indian squaw.
Well, at least we finished the test.
I'm sorry I got to go, Alisha.
Just as well.
- I'll be with you in a minute, Toby.
- Okay.
Miss Claypoole.
Yes?
I don't like being called a squaw.
Did I hear a splash?
Your friend went swimming.
Oh, I see.
Swimming?
Yeah.
- Holly.
- Yeah?
What word would you say if I were to say a word like "boys"?
I wouldn't say anything.
You wouldn't say anything, why not?
I'd wait for you to finish whatever you started to say.
Oh, you wouldn't have done no better at that test than I done then.
You were doing just fine when I arrived.
I was doing the multiplication tables.
Were you, Toby?
- Were you really?
- Yep.
You know what?
Right after dinner,
I'm gonna teach you the nines table, and right on through the 12's.
You hear me?
Uh-huh.
You know, Holly, I can't help but worry about why that Alisha came here.
Whatever it was, Mr. King put her up to it.
I sure hope I didn't say nothing wrong or they'll use it against us as sure as baby rabbits.
Especially after you pushed her into that water.
Oh, Toby, how did you know?
Still too much pressure.
I gotta fix that.
HOLLY: Hi, Mr. Endicott, come on in.
Hi, folks.
Good morning, Mr. Endicott.
Good morning, Toby, boys.
I thought I'd get a little early fishing in today.
Have a cup of coffee?
I don't mind if I do. Thanks.
Quite a few changes around here lately.
Yeah, noisy ones, too.
Why don't they turn down that radio?
That ain't no radio.
It's an orchestra.
At 6:00 in the morning?
It's been playing all night long.
Every night.
Have you talked to them?
I talked to them, they said if it's too noisy, they'd buy us out.
Not only that, they threw dead fish in our water barrel, cut loose our rowboats from their moorings, and somebody dropped a green paint bomb in the john while it was occupied. By me.
Call the cops.
Yeah? But the cops ain't got no say here.
Only federal cops.
When we called the FBI and asked them to help us get some sleep, they got right snippy.
You know, we ought to elect our own sheriff.
Could we have our own sheriff?
Well, you might at that.
If you got all your neighbors together and elected one, the State might grant you a city charter.
Of course, it'd be a mighty small city.
But then, there've been smaller ones.
I'll have my lawyers check into it.
What was that?
Somebody made an eight.
The hard way.
Don't forget your hat.
Oh, Holly.
Now, you were elected sheriff, you gotta look like one.
I don't like all this fuss.
Look, son, this is your first official act as sheriff.
It's like being part of the government,
I don't know whether I like that.
But go ahead, son.
Do your best now, will you?
All right, Pop.
- Where's Nick?
- In the office. Right there.
Come in.
- Good evening.
- Hi.
Well, if it isn't our new sheriff.
Come on in, Toby. Sit down.
Thank you, sir.
Make yourself comfortable.
Would you like a drink?
No, thanks.
You know, it's gonna be a wonderful feeling having you around here to protect us.
- It is?
- Yeah.
Carmine and me and the boys, we're all going to be able to sleep a lot better now.
I sure hope so.
Sheriff, we were wondering, what's gonna be your policy?
Policy?
I pledge allegiance to the flag, and to the country for which it stands, one nation indivisible with...
No, that's not what we want to know.
Is it?
It'll do for openers.
No, what we were really interested in, Sheriff, is what ordinances are you gonna enforce?
I guess I'm gonna enforce them all.
Ain't no need in favoring one over another.
All what?
I mean, what are the local laws?
Well, the same as anywhere else.
People ain't gonna be allowed to make a nuisance of themselves like you and Nick here have been doing.
Well, that's not a law, the way you're saying it.
I mean, a law has to be spelled out so a man knows what he's paying off for.
Right?
Well, I guess a man generally knows when he's wrong, but I guess you're right.
So I'll lay it out the best I can.
Folks all agreed that 11:00 at night would be a good time to stop drinking liquor and raising ruckuses and everything.
So if you fellas will just close up shop at 11:00 you won't have no trouble at all.
Oh, if we just close up shop at 11:00 at night we won't have any trouble at all, huh?
Now, listen, are you nuts?
Ourjoint doesn't get started till 11:00.
I know that, Nick.
And a lot of folks would rather take a licking than close up at 11:00.
You fellas are lucky.
What are you talking about?
Operating out of a trailer you can just up and move away without losing a single night's business.
Oh, we can, huh? Thanks.
Oh, you'd have thought of that, Nick.
No, I don't think so. No.
That's the way it's going to be, huh?
I mean, there's no point in discussing a more sensible arrangement like let's say 2:00 or 3:00?
It wouldn't work out, Carmine.
See, the folks have got to have their rest, you know?
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'll go about my business.
Where you going?
I'm going out and tell the folks they have to go home by 11:00.
I can't let you do that, Toby.
Well, why not?
Oh, 'cause I like you.
And the boys like you.
- Right, boys?
- Right, Nick.
Now, being a sheriff can be a very dangerous thing.
Like, if you walk around out there with that badge on, you might make some of our players nervous.
And some of our players get very rough when they get nervous, see?
You don't wanna be no sheriff, Toby.
Terrible things happen to sheriffs.
Like what, Nick?
Blackie, AI, tell him.
Sure, boss.
Explain it to him good.
The full treatment?
Yeah, the full treatment.
Oh, I appreciate it very much, Nick.
My pleasure.
You'll excuse us, Carmine and I have some business to take care of.
Sure. Sure.
Nice talking to you again.
Let me tell you about some of the things a sheriff runs up against.
First, don't you have a gun or a club?
Oh, I don't see no need for it.
I figure if a man is going to be a peace officer, he shouldn't go around looking un-peaceful.
No gun, no club.
But I can wrestle.
I can wrestle real good, though.
Yeah, but suppose someone sneaked up behind you?
Yeah. And grabbed your arms like this.
And another one was in front of you and he had a sap like this.
And he wrapped it around his wrist like this.
You'd be helpless, wouldn't you?
Unless I done something like this.
Hey, fellas?
FeHas?
Blackie, I'm sorry,
I was just showing you...
AI?
Blackie?
I think they've had enough time.
Now, why don't you run the station wagon around back and we'll hand his body out through the window to you.
What'll I do with him?
Well, if he's still breathing, drop him off at the nearest hospital.
What happened?
They were showing me how I shouldn't get hurt.
I wish they'd wake up so I could apologize to them.
I don't think they can hear me now.
No, I don't think so, either.
AI.
AI!
Hey, Blackie.
Blackiel
I didn't mean to hurt them.
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please!
Hey, listen.
Hey, what are you doing?
I figure if I flick these lights a little bit,
I'll get some attention.
You can't do that.
Oh, yes, I can. It's easy. Watch.
Ladies and gentlemen, now listen to me!
He did it. He did it!
They're wrecking the whole joint.
Who're you calling?
I'm sick and tired of you bush leaguers.
I got to get some real pros down here.
- WOMAN: Operator.
- Long distance.
May I help you?
Yeah, of course you can help me.
Get me Detroit.
What do you want to lock someone out of there for?
Son, that's inhuman.
It ain't for looking out, Pop, it's for locking in.
You see, if I had to arrest somebody, this is about the only place we can use for a jail.
It could be inconvenient.
- Yeah.
- Toby.
Someone just called from the gas station.
One of our rowboats washed up down the point.
Well, I'll hike down there and row it back.
- Can I go with you?
- Sure.
- Here.
- No, Holly.
I don't want to be no sheriff now.
No, a sheriff wears his hat all the time.
That's just like a woman.
Oh, Toby, why is it that every time you don't like what I do,
I'm a woman.
And every time you're pleased with me,
I'm a little girl?
That's just because you ain't neither one.
You're just a little nuisance, that's all.
Just a little nuisance.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Well, the signals off?
Oh, no, they're still on.
- Good.
- Only the joker isn't home.
Blackie saw him go down the highway about 20 minutes ago.
He's got a broad with him.
And he's wearing a hat like the White Hunter.
You know, like a sun helmet.
And he's got a deputy's badge.
I got it.
- Thanks for thinking of me.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Count it, Pete.
Well, that's that.
- Nick?
- Yeah.
Let's go fishing.
Fishing?
Hey, Blackie, there's a couple of hurricane lamps in the back room, bring them over to the pier.
We get a couple of fishing rods and we go fishing.
What, have you gone nuts?
We get the old man to help us with the bait and everything.
- Carmine, I don't want to go...
- Wait a minute.
You don't like the alibi?
We go fishing.
Golly, that was close.
You all right, Holly?
Yeah.
Darn fools, they must be drunker than a bunch of skunks.
They looked like they were trying to run us down.
Oh, now, just 'cause they're drunk don't mean they tried to do it on purpose.
See, they must be drunk.
They done went got themselves stuck in the sand.
Honey, you get out in the woods and wait a little while.
Why? What are you gonna do?
I'm the sheriff, ain't I?
I gotta teach them drunks a lesson.
If they done that on purpose,
I don't want to have to worry about you getting hurt.
Now, move along, now. Move along.
- We're stuck.
- No kidding.
All right, you and Pete get out and push.
And what are you gonna do, grunt?
Never mind, I think I can make it.
I'm the sheriff here, fellas, and I can't give you these keys back till you're fit to drive.
Take care of the sheriff, Pete.
Turn on the music.
And make it loud. I like it loud.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Where's your gun?
I got it.
Now what I want to talk to you fellas about...
Get the artillery!
Holly.
Holly!
Holly?
Over here.
BOY-
Them guys are drunk out of their minds.
One of them tried to shoot me.
No!
They must be on a hunting trip or something.
The whole car's full of guns.
They're coming after you.
Yeah, I know.
I guess I'd better try to sober them up.
Now you stay here, Holly.
TOBY: Hey, fellas.
I'm over here, fellas.
They told us this character didn't carry no gun, right?
Right. I seen him pretty good.
Yeah, yeah, he was empty.
Good.
Hold it.
I think we got him.
I don't see him.
Neither do I.
He's around here somewhere.
Let me have the flashlight.
Here.
TOBY: Hey!
Didn't even get close, fellas!
Mighty poor hunters.
Sounds like he's over there.
No.
Over there.
No, there he is. See the hat?
Hold it, spread out a little.
And when I turn the flashlight on him, give him everything you've got.
Good. Move.
- Louie?
- Yeah.
I thought I told you to spread out.
Well, I was...
Never mind, stay close.
I'm a better shot than you are anyway.
Here, take the flashlight.
Now, you know, drunks oughtn't to be shooting guns anyway.
Hey, Louie! Pete! Louie! Pete!
- Pete, come here.
- What's the matter, what happened?
- What happened?
- I don't know, he got my gun.
Well, how did he do that?
What's the difference? He got it.
- And where's your flash?
- He got that, too.
Why don't we get out of here?
- Which way is out?
-(SHUSHING)
He might hear us.
There he is.
Now blast him.
This time I know we got him.
What is this?
- You see him?
- No.
Me, neither.
What are you shooting at?
TOBY: All right, fellas, you're surrounded!
If you want to keep on making trouble
I'll give you one guess who's gonna be sorry.
Look, Mac, it was all a mistake, you know.
It's always a mistake to get drunk.
Hey, you quit and we'll quit.
I ain't quitting till I get them guns off of you, all of them.
Just drop them right there and move away.
No, that ain't reasonable, Mac, got nothing doing.
All right, Charlie, Larry, let them have it!
Okay, okay. You can have the stinking hardware. Drop it.
TOBY: Turn to your right and keep walking.
All right, that's far enough.
I'll put the car keys back in the ignition for you, fellas.
Wait a minute, Mac.
You're not gonna leave us in this jungle, are you?
Well, you gotta sober up somewhere.
I would lock you up, but the three of you'd be kind of cramped in ourjohn.
Yeah...
Look, after we sober up, how do we get out of here?
Well, when the sun comes up, you just walk straight towards it and that'll take you back to the road.
You fellas better not hang around here anymore.
Don't worry, Mac.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
How long you been in this business?
Ten years.
Twelve.
You meet all kinds of people.
Those terrible men trying to kill you.
I just don't understand it.
It don't make no sense to me, either.
Holly, somebody's sneaking around our porch.
HOLLY: It might be Pop.
TOBY: No, it ain't Pop, he's down on the dock.
Here, hold this.
Got you.
He's being so touchy about a little joke.
What was he doing here?
I don't know, he was carrying this stuff here.
What is it?
Kerosene. Must belong to Nick.
Oh, I'd better take it back over to them.
Hi, Toby.
Hi, kids.
Where's the boat?
We'll have to drive down and load it onto the car.
Come on, we'll tell Pop about it.
Hey, I got another one.
Good, good, good.
You pay for the fish by the pound, you pay for the line by the yard, then keep fishing, keep fishing. Good.
-It's a big one. Did you see that?
- A good one, big one.
- Good evening, folks.
- Hello, Tob.
- How's the fishing?
- Good, good.
Don't make a move, Nick, look what he got.
Yeah, I see it.
What kind of gun is that you got there, son?
Well, it's just a little old burp gun, Pop.
What will those kids take to lay off that stuff?
All right, kids, quit it.
You're getting the dock all bloody and everything.
Nick,
I think I'm gonna be sick.
You think you're sick at your stomach, huh?
Oh, that's bad, makes you feel like you're gonna die, don't it?
He's driving me nuts, playing around like this.
No, I ain't playing.
Pop, I'm gonna need the car for a little while on account of something that happened back out there in the woods.
POP: Help yourself, son.
Would you gentlemen be interested in taking a little ride with me?
HOLLY: Okay, boys, ready for bed.
Do we have to?
Yeah, you have to. Go on.
Evening, gentlemen.
ALL: Evening.
Toby, do you have to carry that awful gun around?
Oh, it's just to scare people with, Holly.
Is he kidding?
I just don't know anymore.
Oh, your friend Blackie, he left a jug of kerosene and a package under our porch.
I took them back to your place.
You what?
Our place?
Yeah, it's right inside the door.
You can find it easy enough.
We can, huh?
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...
Do you do the multiplication tables, too, Nick?
...three, two, one.
I'll be doggone, your place blowed up, Nick.
It's on fire, too.
He must be kidding.
I'm still not sure.
We're getting out of here. For good!
Do you think he'll let us?
Let you?
Why, the sheriff ain't got no say-so about where you go.
Come on.
Me, I'm just as glad they're gone.
I never did cotton up to them.
It ain't nice to say it, Pop, but I never did truly believe them fellas was honest.
Never did.
Pop!
(SOBBING) Pop!
They took the kids away.
They took the kids away.
Take it easy, now, Holly.
Take it easy.
Just slow down, honey.
Tell us what happened.
I went to the school to pick up the twins and I had Ariadne with me.
And then they wouldn't let the twins go.
They took Ariadne, too.
Who did?
(STUTTERING) I don't know.
He had a policeman and a State Trooper.
And he said that he was taking them to the Welfare Department.
He said that it was the law and that there was just nothing he could do about it.
The Welfare Department.
That means that Claypoole woman had something to do with this.
You're quite right, Mr. Kwimper.
What are you two doing in my house?
One for you, one for you, and one for you.
Mr. King, you're a witness that action took place legally.
Well, you can witness this, too.
This here is our sheriff and he's gonna arrest this woman for snitching our kids.
We're gonna get those kids back or she's gonna get locked up in the john.
Prison, I mean.
The children are under the custody of the State Welfare Department by the court order of Judge Waterman.
Judge Waterman respects my opinion as State Welfare supervisor and it is my opinion that you people are simply not fit to raise children.
What a dirty thing you are.
A dirty, dirty, dirty thing.
Why, that's quite a vocabulary...
Now you just hold on, ma'am.
You just hold on.
Did them twins do something wrong?
No, the twins did nothing wrong.
Nothing they could help, considering their environment.
The hearing is at 9:00 tomorrow morning, but we might consent to a postponement.
All right, what's the catch?
Quite simple.
If you were planning to go back where you came from, the court would probably relinquish jurisdiction, let you take your problems home with you.
We're supposed to up and leave our property here...
It's not your...
As a public servant,
I must tell you again.
This whole area was put in for the public's benefit.
How can you get your hat on with your head so crooked?
Do you think the people is one thing and the public is another thing?
You're like every department jackass
I ever knowed.
You do nothing for a single, solitary soul, and that is because you're pretending you're doing something for everybody.
For the public.
Who do you think the public is but me and him and her?
God, please turn your head away.
And you and you.
Now get out of here and leave us alone.
- But don't you...
- Don't argue with him, Arthur. Let's go.
Some mighty fine talking, Pop.
I'd have done better to save my gums for tomorrow.
We'll get the kids back, won't we, Pop?
I ain't gonna lie to you, Holly.
I'm worried, I'm right worried.
BAILIFF: Everybody, please rise.
This is a hearing based on a request by the Department of Public Welfare for a court order, giving the Department control and guardianship over these three children I see here.
Mr. Kwimper, are you represented by counsel?
Come again, Judge?
Have you got a lawyer?
No, sir. Don't believe in them. Never did.
- Don't you indeed?
- No, sir.
Well, suit yourself.
Thank you, Judge.
Now then, since this is a hearing and not a trial, let's keep it simple and informal.
Miss Claypoole, would you start us off.
Thank you.
Your Honor, the Department of Public Welfare is charged with the responsibility of ministering to the well being of all its citizens.
Particularly those of its children.
The cases of these three children have caused the Department deep concern.
Why, the twins live in a home that is hardly more than a breeding ground for delinquency and crime.
The Kwimper adults are immoral, defiant of authority, and strongly suspected of illicitly obtaining funds from government agencies.
And they are also known to have associated closely with gangsters.
I shall document each of these charges when the time comes.
As part of our proof that the Kwimpers are unfit to raise children,
I shall ask Mr. King to report on his dealings with the Kwimper family.
By taking advantage of a technicality,
Your Honor, these people set their own interests above those of six million taxpayers.
When I tried to persuade the Kwimpers to abandon their antisocial point of view,
I received nothing but abuse, in the course of which, the elder Kwimper boasted that he habitually received relief funds as well as aid to dependent children.
I later learned that Toby Kwimper served in the Army where he tricked the doctors into awarding him a total disability allowance.
I use the word "tricked" advisedly.
I can prove that he suffers from no physical disqualifications at all.
Anything more?
Quite a lot, Your Honor.
The Department should like to point out that the Kwimpers have no legal status as guardians for these children.
Moreover, the Kwimpers encouraged two notorious gangsters to set up a gambling establishment in their neighborhood.
Subsequently, the Kwimpers quarreled with the gangsters, burned down their establishment, and finally drove them out at gunpoint.
Yes, I heard something about that.
Frightening.
Terrible.
So is the fact that an unmarried girl by the name of Holly Jones lives with the Kwimpers in a relationship that I would not care to explore.
Goodness.
What a terrible thing to say.
Be quiet. You will have an opportunity to answer the charges.
One final point, Your Honor.
As a qualified psychologist,
I gave Toby Kwimper a word association test which is designed to reveal basic motivations.
It was during the process of giving this test that I was attacked and knocked down by Miss Jones.
And you people claim that you don't need a lawyer?
What did the test reveal?
Attitudes that were shocking to the entire Welfare Department.
I submit a copy to the court.
Well, what have you to say about all this?
Judge, would you mind if we hashed this over by ourselves for a little while?
Hash it over, by all means.
Thank you, Judge.
Do you know what I think, Pop?
I think we don't look so good.
It's unfair.
She's twisted every single fact.
Now, somebody's gonna untwist it.
Good for you, Pop.
Not me. I'll get mad and that won't do any good.
You take care of it, Toby.
Me? I ain't very good at talking.
We won't be no worse off than we are now.
Please, Toby.
Go ahead, son. Go ahead.
I don't know, Pop.
Please. Please, son.
I'll probably make a mess of things, Judge, but Pop and Holly here, they've got faith in me.
So, here goes.
You may still hire a lawyer.
Well, Pop's already said no to that and Pop's usually right about everything he says.
First off, maybe I was wrong when I wanted to throw Mr. King off the property.
Very gracious of you.
Yes, sir.
There's no need for me to get ornery just because Mr. King got a little nasty.
Now, just what nasty thing did Mr. King do?
He tried to throw us off the property that he had no say-so about.
Got our backs up and everything.
Judge, would it be legal-like if I were to answer some of the things that was said against me, personal?
You may choose the order of your rebuttal.
That means it's all right?
Yes.
Well, about my back, then.
They told me at Fort Dix that I strained my back after my first judo lesson.
I told the docs it had straightened out after the next lesson and it weren't nothing to begin with.
But they said it was and I had to go on total disability.
Now, I'm willing to admit that a doctor might know just a little bit more than me, so I've been taking the checks ever since.
But the way it's worked out,
I might have done the wrong thing.
And if I did, I'm awful sorry.
Are you defending yourself, or making a confession?
I'm just trying to tell what happened.
Is that all right?
Well, it's pretty unusual, but go on.
Judge, it don't do me no good to talk against people who ain't here to answer back.
But all we done to Nick and Carmine was just return a package they left at our house.
We didn't know there was a bomb in it.
If we'd have known it, we'd have thrown it in the bay.
And we didn't chase them off at gunpoint, either.
When their place blowed up, they just up and beat it.
Well, if you can prove that, it takes care of an important point.
Oh, I can prove it, Judge, but it don't seem that important to me.
It doesn't, eh? Why not?
Well, if I was a Judge, in charge of deciding who was to bring up three nice kids,
I'd just be wondering if Pop was a good man and if Holly was a good woman.
You can ask the twins about Holly.
I mean, they're just kids, but kids know who they love.
And who taught them everything they know and made them like it.
Dog me, Holly's just a kid, too, but they don't come no better.
And smart, too.
If it weren't for her, we'd really be on relief right now or starving to death.
I've already pointed out why he'd be prejudiced on that point, Your Honor.
I reckon I'm prejudiced on a lot of points you ain't, ma'am.
First of all, I'm prejudiced against twisting the truth around.
And I'm prejudiced against hurting kids.
Particularly hurting them just because I'm sore at their folks.
Judge, can I say something?
Go ahead.
I don't like to say this, Judge.
I don't like to talk against a woman's good name.
But for the sake of the kids, though,
I gotta do it.
Well, you certainly have me interested.
Hell ain't got no fury like a woman scorned.
Yes?
That's all, Judge.
Well, Mr. Kwimper, your observation may or may not be accurate.
I couldn't say which, myself.
But I would like to know why you said it.
I said it because it's true, Judge.
That Miss Claypoole there, she went after Toby like he come with green coupons.
She was leaning on him, she was tickling him, she was kissing him.
And when he paid her no never mind she set out to give us what hell ain't got no fury like.
Your Honor, I shall not dignify that falsehood with a denial.
I should simply like to point out that it is not I who am on trial here.
No one is on trial here, Miss Claypoole.
This is a hearing.
Now do you support what your father just said?
I'd rather not answer that, sir.
Very well. Briefly then, did Miss Claypoole ever kiss you?
Yes, sir.
Really, Your Honor, what do you expect them to say?
Why, they'll clutch at any straw.
Please be seated, Miss Claypoole, and we'll have no further interruptions.
Continue.
I was talking about Pop and how it might help you to know the kind of man he is.
Pop don't like to be talked about and I most generally try to do what he likes.
But I can't help myself this time, though.
My pop's an ornery man, Judge, that's 'cause he's so smart.
He can't stand it when people act stupid.
I ain't so bright myself and it's a wonder to me that we get along as well as we do.
Many a times I was a-minded to go against him.
I thought maybe there was more to living than just enjoying it the way Pop taught me.
But I was never dumb enough to go against him, Judge.
And it usually turned out I was glad I didn't.
Now, it's a fact that Ariadne and the twins and Holly ain't no kin to Pop.
Now, don't that make you stop and think, Judge?
You name me another man that would take in three hungry children just because they ain't got no place to go and no one to turn to.
Pop ain't got no money.
He ain't never had.
Why'd he take in three strange kids?
I'll tell you why, Judge, it's 'cause he's a good man.
He's always been good to me and he's always been good to them.
He always will be, too.
Now, that's all that matters here today, and if you don't know that, Judge, you ain't no judge.
Your Honor, may I remind you of my findings in this man's word association test?
He may mean well consciously, but his subconscious motivations are all that really matter.
Well, have you anything to say about that test?
Yes, sir. Could I say it in private?
Very well.
Thank you.
Counsel for the defense points out then, very correctly, that his test has nothing to do with the case.
It is his father who is the children's presumptive guardian.
Well, let his father take the test.
I have one right here.
That was counsel's suggestion.
Yes.
That's a good idea.
Mr. Kwimper, please.
Did you get light in the head?
Mr. Kwimper, do you understand the word association test?
- The test that Toby took? Yep.
- That's right.
Would you sit down there, please?
Very well, we may proceed.
Ready?
Yep.
Court.
Child.
We're cooked.
Mmm-hmm.
Moon.
Election.
House.
Those will be sufficient, Your Honor.
All right.
Thank you very much, Mr. Kwimper.
You're welcome, Judge.
Can you analyze these answers now?
I believe so.
Very well. We'll proceed.
Court. Crime.
Well, that's the simple-minded response of a criminal nature.
A court is where you go when you've committed a crime.
Now wait a minute.
Never mind.
Child. Labor.
Oh, that's obvious.
He thinks of children in terms of exploiting their labor.
Oh, now, really, I think that is...
Your Honor,
I have a Master's degree in psychology.
Moon. Shine.
That's an illegal liquor drunk by illiterate, irresponsible alcoholics.
What about Shine On, Harvest Moon?
That's a song.
What's that got to do with alcoholics?
- I don't understand...
- That's enough.
Your request for a court order is denied.
I don't think you understand.
Any qualified...
Miss Claypoole, you're the one who doesn't understand this test.
Those answers were not Mr. Kwimper's.
They were mine.
That was counsel's suggestion.
And you, Mr. Kwimper, were right about not needing a lawyer.
You couldn't have had a better one.
Well, this court has had a remarkable experience today.
It's had the rare privilege of listening to an honest man.
And it's had a further privilege.
It has heard the history of a little settlement, a little colony that overcame hardships, fought back men of evil purpose and survived all kinds of legalistic and financial difficulties.
It's gratifying to know that the spirit of the pioneer, the spirit that made this the greatest country in the world, ladies and gentlemen, it's thrilling to know that this spirit is still functioning today.
Our government needs it more than ever, don't you think?
I agree, Judge. I'm willing to admit that I've been letting the government down a little lately,
I haven't been taking any relief or unemployment insurance but I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.
We'll get together sometime.
Yes.
Case dismissed.
I knowed it! I knowed it!
Eddy! Teddy! Ariadne!
TOBY:
Angel
Angel
Angel
With those angel eyes
Come and take this Earth boy
Up to paradise
Angel
May I hold you tight?
Never kissed an angel
Let me kiss one tonight
If I said "I love you"
Would I be speaking out of turn?
I'm only human
But I'm willing to learn
Angel
Make my wish come true
Let me be in heaven
Here on Earth with you
Angel
Never kissed an angel
Let me kiss one tonight
If I said "I love you"
Would I be speaking out of turn?
I'm only human
But I'm willing to learn
Angel

Hello, Holly.
Hello, Toby.
You look awful pretty tonight.
Thank you.
Too bad ain't nobody here to see you.
Isn't it, though.
- Toby.
- Hmm.
I want the truth.
What did that Claypoole woman do to make you kiss her?
Oh, you know, Holly.
You know.
No, I don't.
Now, you answer me.
Oh, we was lying on them pillows, remember?
I remember.
Well, we was lying on them...
Oh, I want you to show me exactly what happened.
Step by Step-
Now, you were lying down like this.
And then what?
Then she kind of leaned down real close to me.
- Like this?
- Mmm-hmm.
She run her fingers over my forehead.
Like this?
Well, not so much like you was ironing a shirt, it was a little softer.
That's it.
And then she made me put my arms around her.
- Like this?
- Mmm-hmm.
Then she leaned down and kissed me, and I guess I kissed her.
1 ob'! , are you doing that darn times table?
But you know something?
I never got to the 12's so fast.
12 times 12 is 144.
What bothers me is what comes after the 12's.
Me, Toby.
Me.
POP: Got to fix that.
She's loaded with pressure.
(man) Why should I care?
Why should I let it touch me?
Why shouldn't I
Sit down and try to
let it pass over me?
Why should they stare?
Why should I let it get me?
What's the use of despair
If they call you a square?
You're a long time dead
like my old pal Fred
So why oh why should I
Bother to?
If they see that you're blue
they'll look down on you
So why oh why should I
Bother to care?
Thank God I know more
Why oh why should I
Bother to care?
God bless you.
- I haven't seen him on the TV. Have you?
- What's that?
- I've not seen him on TV.
- Who?
Archie Rice.
It's only a lot of daft girls standing about with nothing on.
- Come on, Father.
- He looks daft.
- Will you come on when I tell you?
- He's never been on TV.
Granddad!
Granddad! Granddad!
- Hello, Granddad.
- Jean! I wondered who it was.
- I'm sorry if I startled you.
- I didn't know who it was.
- I was miles away.
- It's good to see you.
It's good to see you, my darling.
Give your grandfather a kiss.
- Give me your case.
- I can manage.
Hold your bloody noise.
Your stepmother's in one of her moods so I came out.
I can't stand rows with Phoebe any more, so I come and sit on the pier.
Albert. Take care of this for me, will you?
- This is my granddaughter.
- Have you come to see your dad?
Thank you. Come on.
- Who's that?
- Archie Rice's daughter.
It's good to see you.
How long are you going to stay?
Just a few days, I expect.
- Have you heard from young Mick?
- Yes, he's fine.
He'll be all right. But it's a nasty business to get mixed up in.
All those people in Egypt and God knows where else.
They seem to do what they like to us nowadays.
I went to the rally last Sunday.
- What for, for God's sake?
- I don't know.
I've got myself steamed up about a lot of things lately.
You want to have your bloody head read.
- That's more or less what Graham said.
- Graham?
My fiancé.
(horn)
- Can we go now, miss?
- All right.
Paints and brushes on this table and paintings over here.
(mouths)
(rock 'n' roll music from next room)
- Finished?
- Yes, miss.
Don't you want to go and dance?
You don't have to go if you don't want to.
Good night.
Here, watch out where you're going!
- Am I late?
- (wolf-whistle)
No, his train doesn't leave for an hour.
You were making a lot of noise.
Well, my little social worker, what was it tonight?
The bicycle-chain ball or the flick-knife excuse-me?
Can't see the soldier brother off to the wars with a long face like that.
No, I should look pleased about it, shouldn't I?
How do you think you could ever make anything out of those monsters?
Don't let's do this again.
You are never going to do anything with those sort of people.
Don't talk to me about those sort of people.
If it weren't for your sort of people still in other people's countries, my brother wouldn't be going off to fight.
- The telegram came at breakfast.
- Why didn't they wait till February?
Oh, I don't know.
I'm thinking of signing on.
Well... up the flag, Mick.
Here's to you.
Let's hope it's a false alarm.
Thank you.
- You're leaving tonight?
- No, they're flying us out in the morning.
It's nice of you to come and see me off.
- Off to defend the Empire.
- My queen and country need me.
I wish I could think it was funny.
Give him a break. He'll be all right.
Jean's always taken everything seriously.
I've always taken it as it comes, but not Jeannie.
Cheer up, love. Life isn't as bad as all that.
Even if it is, there's nothing we can do.
I must be off.
- Come on.
- Well, that needs cleaning for a start.
- I'll do it.
- Good lad. Come on.
Don't come any further.
There's my mob there.
- Goodbye, love.
- Bye.
- Stick in the back if there's shooting.
- You bet.
- Go up and see Phoebe and the old boy.
- I'm going to.
Goodbye, Graham.
Are you two getting married?
- Ask her.
- Well, make her! It's what Jean needs.
I'll bring you back a fuzzy-wuzzy for your wedding present. Bye.
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.
Let's go.
- Do you want to eat somewhere?
- No, thanks.
- It might cheer you up.
- I want to go home.
All right.
- Do you want to come?
- What about the landlady?
We'll beat her up.
I've been longing to tell you all day.
They want a decision pretty soon.
- Why Africa?
- The firm's expanding out there.
You know - young men, big opportunities.
- Do you want to go?
- Yes, I do. I've thought about it a lot.
We could get married next month.
Supposing I don't want to go, Graham?
Would you go just the same?
- I don't think that's a fair question.
- No, but I'm asking it.
- If we married it might change your mind.
- What if I didn't?
- Why do you want to go?
- I've told you.
Big opportunities. Big deal.
You love me, don't you?
You still want to marry me?
- Of course.
- Then why do we argue?
I don't understand you.
There's nothing to keep you here.
Nothing.
Nothing but a bunch of teddy boys who ought to be put in jail.
Don't pretend you can't leave that deadbeat family of yours.
Can't you understand?
This job means something to me.
I'm not good enough to paint myself, but this is something I really can do.
Maybe the first term has been hell, but I'm not going to give up.
There's nothing to keep us here.
You've never stopped saying everything about this country's dead. I agree.
This would be a wonderful chance for us to get out of it.
I'm sorry.
- I'm so tired.
- (whispers) I know. I'm sorry.
Don't be.
Take me to bed.
I'm all right, Granddad.
I feel better now I've talked about it.
You always liked coming to see me.
You were a pretty little thing.
Not that looks are everything.
You don't look at the mantelpiece when you poke the fire.
Archie always saw you were nicely turned out.
He was a smart little boy himself.
Used to dress 'em in sailor suits then.
- Funny how they all turn out.
- How is Dad?
He's a fool. Raising money for another show when he hasn't enough for this one.
- What's this one like?
- I don't know. I haven't seen it.
They don't want human beings any more.
You're a lovely lot tonight.
I've played in front of them all, you know.
The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales...
- What's that other pub?
- (faint titters)
That went better at first house.
What about these crooners?
I don't know what they're coming to.
Look at the stuff they sing.
"The Darktown Strutters' Ball".
"The Basin Street Ball".
"The Woodchoppers' Ball".
It's a lot of... rubbish, isn't it?
- He's a bit suggestive, isn't he?
- Now I'm going to sing you a little song.
A little song written by Rimsky-Nastikov.
It's entitled "The Church Bell Won't Ring
Tonight as the Vicar's got the Clapper."
Hide your face, Mum, the girls have got me
I shan't be home for an hour or two
I've got all sorts of nice things to do
They've got me worked up in such a state
So hide your face, Mum, cos I can't hardly wait
So hide your face, Mum, the girls have got me
The girls, the glamorous gorgeous girls, have got me
All right, Nicky?
- Hey.
- Take her up.
- Jean!
- Hello, Frank.
Nice to see you, love.
- Got a holiday?
- Sort of. I've just seen Granddad.
Dad's on.
As you may possibly have guessed.
- He'll be off in a minute, though.
- OK.
But it's when she'd gone and left me
That I started to say good night
(thin applause)
- Can't be anyone in front tonight.
- Look who's here.
Hello, Jean!
This is nice.
I haven't got my glasses on.
I know. You thought I was the income tax man.
- All right, are you?
- Fine.
Hide your face, Mum, the girls have got him
He won't be home for an hour or two
He's got all sorts of nice things to do
They've got him worked up in such a state
Hide your face, Mum
The girls, the glamorous gorgeous girls, have got him now
(applause)
(applause peters out)
- How's it going?
- First house about 60 sad little drabs.
- Tonight about 200 sad little drabs.
- Excuse me.
Frank! I'd like to see you.
If we go on next week, it will be by very reluctant agreement of 20 angry people.
- Have you been home?
- No, not yet.
- I ought to have warned Phoebe.
- Not to worry. You can have Mick's room.
- How is Mick? Have you heard from him?
- Yes. He's just twiddling his thumbs.
It's hot, he says. Not one for subtle detail.
- Kids say if they aren't paid they'll quit.
- Well, let 'em.
Go and get a couple of bottles.
I'm going to have a celebration.
- Of what?
- My 20th anniversary.
Of not paying income tax.
You go with him, love.
I'll meet you at Buckingham Palace.
I've got a couple of people to see.
- Good night, Frank.
- (wolf-whistles)
(classical music)
- Did you see Ree?
- Better get some lolly for her.
Here's your week.
It's not so hot.
(sighs)
- Want one?
- I don't think I'd better, had I?
- Uh-oh.
- Well? What about it?
I'll just be five minutes.
I've got to listen to the news.
- I'm not leaving this theatre without it.
- Just five minutes.
(radio) There'll be another programme
in this series next week.
The eleven-o'clock news summary
follows almost at once.
(pips)
This is the BBC Home Service. Here is the
summary of the news. First of all, Suez.
A number of British paratroopers
are reported to have been captured.
Names will be withheld
until the next of kin have been informed.
The House of Commons is debating
the situation in the Middle East tomorrow.
Latest reports were considered
at a cabinet meeting this afternoon.
Oh, this is nice! What a shame - if I'd known I could have been back earlier, but I saw a bit of the picture round again.
- What was it like?
- Wasn't up to much.
They're showing a lot of rubbish these days.
They're going to close it down.
Everything's doing badly.
- That's what worries Archie.
- Good night, Mum. See you, Jeano.
- Where are you off to?
- He's got an extra job.
He's playing the piano in one of these late-night drinking places.
- It is lovely to see her, isn't it, Dad?
- Yes.
He's pleased. He doesn't have anyone much to talk to, do you?
He won't come to the pictures with me.
He likes to listen to a play on the wireless.
- (shouts) You like a nice play!
- I can't sit for long.
- I'm all right.
- I'm at Woolworth's now. Did I tell you?
I'm on the electrical counter.
Not bad. Girls are a bit common.
- It is nice to see you.
- Archie says you've heard from Mick.
Yes, he's out there. You think he's going to be all right, don't you?
Why do they send these boys out?
They're just kids. That's all he is, a kid.
- They do look after them, don't they?
- Oh yes, they look after them all right.
They look after them better now than they did. The Dardanelles.
I went through that without a scratch.
Not a scratch on me.
Aye aye. I've just been talking to our coloured friend on the stairs.
- He's a student.
- No, he's a ballet dancer.
Is he? He's a big fellow.
- Playing the Winter Gardens.
- Ballet dancer?
He says if you drop your hat outside there, kick it all the way to the promenade before you pick it up.
- There's a telegram come for you.
- Don't you think she's looking peaky?
- There's a telegram come for you!
- It's probably one of my creditors.
Good girl.
You remembered Phoebe's Dubonnet.
She likes that. Don't you? She thinks she's being awfully U when she drinks it.
Well, I like it. It seems to soothe me.
- Was it all right at the theatre?
- No, it was not all right at the theatre.
Have your Dubonnet, dear.
Jean, that's yours.
- Billy, wake up!
- I am awake.
- Well, stop yelling, then. Here's a drink.
- I don't want it.
Yes, you do. Don't argue.
I'm having a celebration.
- What have you got to celebrate about?
- Oh, dear.
Not a thing you can call your own, and as sure as God made little apples
I'll lay a sovereign to a penny piece you'll be bankrupt before Christmas.
And you'll be lucky not to end up in jail.
- Get him to go to bed.
- Go to bed. You're overtired.
I'm not overtired. I don't relish the idea of a jailbird in the family.
Shut up, Dad.
You've had too much to drink.
I used to have half a bottle of brandy for breakfast.
And a pound of steak and a couple of chorus girls.
I leave chorus girls to you. Do you know what James Agate said about me?
That you and Pat Campbell were his favourite female impersonators.
You know bloody well what he said.
We all know what he said and every word of it was true.
Your daughter went to that
Trafalgar Square circus last Sunday.
Did you really? Are you one of those who don't like the prime minister?
I've grown fond of him.
Does he bring you out in spots?
- I wish I knew what was going to happen.
- I feel like that about that dog downstairs.
- What is going to happen?
- Three things do that to me.
- Nuns, clergymen and dogs.
- I don't want to always have to work.
You want a bit of life before it's all over.
Takes the gilt off if you've got to go on and on until they carry you out in a box.
- Did I tell you my nun story?
- It's all right for him.
He still has his women.
While it lasts, anyway.
But I don't want to end up being lain out by some stranger in some rotten little street in Gateshead or
West Hartlepool or another of those holes.
Phoebe, don't upset yourself.
Let's enjoy ourselves.
Do you think I don't want to enjoy myself?
(wails)
I wish women wouldn't cry.
I wish they wouldn't.
- Say something to her, Jean.
- Why don't you?
I wish I could. I only wish I could.
Phoebe...
Phoebe, dear, would you like to go to bed?
Yes, I think I will if you don't mind, dear.
I think perhaps I've overdone it a bit.
I never could stand too much excitement.
And I'm worrying about Mick underneath.
I keep thinking about all that fighting.
Get some sleep.
You'll feel better when you wake up.
Yes, dear.
- Would you come and say good night?
- Yes, I'm just finishing my celebration.
- He's funny.
- Good night, son.
- Good night.
- Good night, Jean.
It was good seeing you.
We'll have a good talk tomorrow.
- Dad?
- Yeah?
You're keeping something to yourself.
- You never miss a trick.
- What is it?
Mick's been taken prisoner.
No point in breaking it tonight.
I think I'd like some of that.
We'll drink to Mick.
Let's hope to God he manages.
Mick. And... the income tax man.
With you it's prime ministers.
With me it's dogs.
Nuns, clergymen and dogs.
Did I ever tell you the greatest compliment I ever had paid me?
I was walking along the promenade somewhere. I think it was here, actually.
One day...
25 years ago.
I was quite a young man.
There I was walking along the promenade to meet what I think we used to call a piece of crackling... when two nuns came toward me.
Two nuns.
Talk to me.
(yelling and shrieking)
(puppet) Get down. Get downstairs.
Get down there.
- Jean.
- There's nothing fresh.
It's the same description as we heard on the news.
You'd think those rogues in Parliament were glad our boys were taken prisoner.
Their own country always wrong and the other lot's always right.
Dad, we're worried enough as it is.
It says "Lt Pearson, who had been with
Sgt Rice shortly before he was captured, said he killed at least seven attackers before he was overwhelmed."
"'He must have run out of ammunition,' he said. 'Rice wasn't the type..."'
Don't go on.
I just can't bear to think about it.
I fried these up for your breakfast.
They don't look very nice. I'm sorry.
Never mind. I'm not really hungry.
- Where's Frank?
- He went to the theatre.
Said he wouldn't be in for breakfast.
- Where's Dad?
- Out. He had a call from the town hall.
- Sit down?
- No, thanks, Granddad.
About the bathing beauty competition.
He'll be in his element.
Bathing beauties? Haven't got the figures nowadays. They're all skin and bone.
What'll he do after this?
Is he really trying to put on another show?
I don't know how, after that last business.
He's still a bankrupt.
You knew that. I have to sign everything for him. He can't get any credit.
Still, he could always twist me round his little finger.
He won't listen to me.
He spends half his time in that Rockcliffe.
That damned meat market by the clock tower.
- How'd you do that?
- How'd I pay income tax 20 years ago?
Pure bad luck. I was trapped in a hospital with a double hernia.
Very nasty it was. I thought all my plans for the future were going to be finished.
That's another story
I'll tell you sometime.
There I was lying on my back wondering whether draught Bass alone was enough to make life worth living...
Arnold, five more.
...when two men sprang at me from behind the screens.
That was Archie's one downfall.
I think the ward sister tipped them off.
She used to tell me she was spiritual.
I'd gone legit just then and I was in A Tale Of Two Cities.
When I told her, she said
"I've heard of that." She was Irish.
"Isn't that about Sodom and Gomorrah?"
Hey, Harold. Can I have a word?
Harold, how about...
How about a booking?
At the Winter Garden, when the season's over?
What do you have in mind?
Something lavish. A couple of top-liners.
I've got hold of those costumes from Syd Stein's Blackpool show.
- Fabulous stuff.
- Leave it alone.
I was having a drink with
Doreen Maine's agent last Thursday.
Doreen Maine. You know. One of her records hit the top ten. Last February.
- I'd like to do you a favour.
- I'm not asking any favours.
- What management?
- Me.
- Are you really serious?
- Serious? You don't understand.
- I need this booking. I really need it.
- I'd have to see the show first.
- I've got to open somewhere.
- Now, Archie.
We've had some laughs.
Let's leave it like that.
With a booking like this
I could break the circuits.
You know me.
I only deal with established properties.
I'm asking you as a friend.
You know my office. If you've got a concrete proposition I'm ready to listen.
Sorry about that, Harold.
Worrying about young Mick, I dare say.
That's all right, Archie.
Well, I must rush now, boys.
The call of the bathing belle competition.
- I'm judging the finals.
- I thought Wally Barker was.
He dropped out, so they sent for the expert.
Mind you, they don't understand the business in this country.
On the Continent they put the girls up for auction.
Did I tell you about the chap who'd take out a pen... Sorry, too late.
- So long, Frank.
- So long.
- Can I help you, darling?
- I'm looking for Mr Rice.
- I'm his daughter.
- Which one are you?
The one born yesterday?
As a matter of fact, she is my sister.
Oh.
Sorry.
Jean! Jean.
- Now listen, he didn't mean anything.
- I know what he meant.
- Who is he?
- The new manager of the Winter Garden.
- I wouldn't trust him behind a curtain...
- With his feet showing. As Dad says.
- Why does he go on with it?
- Who, Dad?
In the blood, I suppose. Yours too, I'll bet.
- I wish sometimes he'd face up to reality.
- I don't think he faces up to much else.
He knows music hall's dying better than you do.
And what about you, Frank?
Are you going on with it?
Talent got a bit thin when it come down to me.
- And the courage too.
- Courage?
Yeah. Courage to go on.
Like Archie. He's got it.
- Walk to the Winter Garden with me.
- Why?
I'm standing in for the lady horganist for half a hour. Come on.
(organ music)
Course Granddad had the real talent.
He had what it takes.
People still remember him.
They stop him in the street.
He's about all that's left of all that music-hall stuff and all them other things.
Still, as Phoebe always says...
- Better to be a has-been...
- Than a never-was.
It must have been better than this, anyway.
Something's missing, isn't it?
(Scottish accent)
Mrs Sandy MacPherson calls.
You'll be late for the beauty competition.
I'll see you.
(organ music)
(Archie over PA)
Miss Vicky Thelwell of Leeds.
She likes weightlifting and dislikes
men with beards. Has no hobbies.
What about her, eh? She needs some
beef putting into her, if you ask me.
Nobody's asked me. Never mind.
Miss Anne Thomlinson of Heysham.
Likes steak, dislikes getting up
in the morning, and has no hobbies.
Miss Shirley Lawrence from Ripon.
She likes midnight swimming and
dislikes wolves and her hobby is sailing.
Now Miss Joyce Richards from Heysham.
She likes weightlifting and dislikes men drivers and she's got no hobbies.
- (wolf-whistle) She's a smasher.
- Give over, Father.
Don't look so worried. Your old man may be square, but he still loves the curves.
- How about that for a bit of Pi R squared?
- Where did they dig him up?
- Hello. Hello, Granddad.
- Hello, dear.
You've missed most of it. This is the final walk-round. Archie's been good.
- Yes, I was watching from the back.
- He hasn't said a word about Mick all day.
He's worried about him.
That's why I came out.
- To take my mind off it.
- She's pretty.
And now Miss Tina Lapford from Burnley.
She likes meeting people. Dislikes sarcasm. Hobbies: Amateur dramatics.
(wolf-whistle)
Whoo!
- I wonder which he's picked for himself?
- Hold your bloody noise.
Doesn't like me talking about it.
As if she doesn't know!
- There's no reason to talk about it.
- She's not soft. Are you, dear?
I don't want hear about it and I shouldn't think Jean does.
And now, before our distinguished judges make their final selection, these lovely girls are going to line up for you so you can make yours.
I've made mine. Of course this is a very tense moment, very tense indeed.
The judges have an elaborate system of marking.
They're marked "good",
"very good" and "wow".
There you are, boys.
Aren't they gorgeous?
Come on, boys. That'll take the tops off your boiled eggs for you.
If I mention the women, it's because it's always been the same thing with them.
Still, I suppose it's different with men.
More important to them.
- Will you hold your bloody noise?
- Why don't you?
Now the moment you've all been waiting for - the judges' final announcement.
For the third prize we have
Miss Joyce Richards of Heysham.
- Just 19 and very nice too.
- (applause)
Thank you.
To present the prizes, I have the great honour and pleasure to introduce to you that great star of TV, stage, screen and labour exchange, Mr MacDonald Hobley.
Congratulations to you.
And the second place, Miss Tina Lapford from Burnley. Age 20 and very nice too.
I'd vote for her.
Oh, no. Don't think much of her.
Good luck to you.
(organ plays)
- All yours, Mac.
- Thanks.
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the cheque for £1,000 and the holder of the title of Miss Great Britain is Valerie Martin from Salisbury.
Listen. You two wait here while I try and find Archie before the big rush.
They'll be starting the photographs soon.
- And you behave yourself.
- Yes, yes, yes.
Beauty competition? I can't tell the women from the men, not from the back.
Even from the front you have to take a good look sometimes.
You look thirsty.
How about having a drink with me?
I can't because I've got my mum with me.
- Bring her along too.
- Really?
- Of course. Is she here?
- Come over and meet her.
- I'd love to. Is she pretty?
- No!
- She must be.
- No, she's not a bit. Mum!
This is Mr Rice. He wanted to meet you.
This is my mum, Mrs Lapford.
Go and get changed and then you won't get cold.
I thought they'd never decide.
I'm not saying that because of Tina.
Second prize is better than no prize.
- Everyone said it should have been first.
- What did they see in that girl?
- Archie?
- A lot of the girls were extremely ladylike.
But that one?
The one that won first prize?
I'm sorry, I shall just have to say it.
She was just common.
That's all I can say. Just common.
I knew our Tina had it in her when she was a little girl.
She was always doing impersonations.
Weren't you?
- Oh, that.
- "Oh, that?"
Film stars. Veronica Lake she used to do.
And Donald Duck.
And... who else did you do, love?
- I don't remember. I was only a little kid.
- I knew she had it in her then.
That's why she had elocution lessons.
She started those before school.
She's worked hard.
Of course she's got her head screwed on.
You'll have seen that. You see, she wants to get on, so I'm quite sure she will.
All she needs is a little push.
When you see some of those girls on television... honest.
You're right, Mrs... Lapford.
I think... Tina, your Tina, could easily go places in a big way.
It's just a question of the breaks, as you say.
Now, I'm just wondering.
You see, I have a new show opening at the Winter Garden, actually.
The Winter Garden? Have you?
Yes. You see, it's an expensive show.
Doreen Maine and thousands of pounds' worth of costumes.
It's quite a proposition.
It just might be the right break for Tina.
- You're late.
- I'm sorry. I got held up.
- Had to sort out some scenery.
- Why'd you want to meet in this dump?
- We can have a drink in the caravan.
- What caravan?
I'll show you.
Friend of mine owns a site.
There.
I thought we could be alone for the afternoon.
OK?
OK.
Don't worry.
- How do you feel?
- I feel...
- Happy, I suppose.
- So do I.
I've never been as happy as this.
Have you?
No, I don't think I have.
I've only ever had a young boyfriend.
- Not used to the old crocks, then?
- Don't be so daft.
I mean, I've never made love.
Not like this afternoon.
Haven't you?
Do you think I'm in love with you?
- You tell me.
- Yes.
Yes, I think I must be.
What was your wife like, Archie?
She was... a bit difficult to describe.
Didn't you get on very well?
Well, yeah, well...
She didn't really approve of the way I carried on, you see.
- What do you mean?
- Well...
She didn't think I took life seriously.
Why should you take life seriously?
What good does it do you?
I think you look smashing when you're on the stage.
- Where are your children, then?
- The girl's in London.
One of the boys is in the army.
Hey.
What time have we got to meet your mum and dad?
Half past five.
I'd better get dressed, hadn't I?
Yeah.
I can't wait to be in the new show.
Dad'll help with the money.
He's driving over today to talk about it.
So don't worry. Mum'll fix that.
Oh, Archie. You make me feel so good.
You do, really.
There's something... I don't know... marvellous about you.
- Did you ever want to get married again?
- No.
- Never met anyone, I suppose.
- That's right.
(radio) Here is a summary of the news.
The War Office announced that
Sgt Michael Rice was being released
after negotiations which began
at 11 o'clock this morning.
Sgt Rice is reported to be fit and well.
An allocated aircr...
What is it, eh?
Tell me, Archie. What is it?
What?
What's that that makes you so marvellous?
Say you love me, Archie.
I love you.
Home in a few days! I can't believe it.
I knew they wouldn't keep him.
They wouldn't dare. Even nowadays.
I hope it's true and nothing will go wrong.
You do talk the most almighty rubbish.
They say they've got an aeroplane standing by.
I don't want Archie to be disappointed on top of everything else.
You should never build things up.
You're always disappointed.
That's Archie's trouble. Always builds things up. Always off on some new idea.
- And he said...
- I say, he's the limit.
- Wait a minute.
- Sorry, go on.
He said "Why do they call it the Cat-Rice Inn?"
He said "By the time the cats are finished chasing the electric saucer of milk, it's turned into a rice pudding."
That one's not so good, but I got it from my landlady.
It's not the only thing I got off her.
I haven't laughed so much in a long time.
You know that boy they took prisoner?
His name's Rice. Did you see the papers?
I heard it on the radio. Another cup?
- I don't mind if I do.
- Hold on. I'm mother.
Now it's time we got down to business, as the bishop said...
- To the actress. I know.
- Don't worry, Archie.
I'll see her right. You have my hand on it.
- Then the deal's all set?
- It is.
- And Tina's happy. Aren't you, love?
- Oh, yes.
Well, thanks.
Well, I've got to get off to the theatre.
Why don't we all come, now we're in show business?
Tina can pick up a few tips.
This is just a little summer show.
It's nothing like the glorious shape of things to come.
But if you understand that, by all means.
I'll leave seats at the box office for you.
Bye-bye, now.
Oh, I say. He's a charming man, isn't he, Wilfred?
- Now, Ada, this is just a business deal.
- I'm well aware of that.
Archie?
I can't see you tonight.
It'll have to be tomorrow.
All right, love.
- That wasn't Archie, was it?
- No.
Jean, could you lend me ten bob?
Do you mind, dear? Just till I get paid.
I thought I'd buy this for Mick.
He's got such a sweet tooth.
He loves anything like this.
- It's a bit jazzy, isn't it?
- Jazzy? I don't think it's jazzy.
I don't know what you mean by jazzy.
Mick'll like it anyway.
Look, take this.
Archie gave it to me this morning.
I'll borrow that, then.
I'll give it you back.
OK. Only I can't come.
I promised to meet Granddad at the club.
- All right, dear.
- I'll see you later.
- Can I wear my diamond brooch?
- Course you can.
My diamond brooch. Eh, Dad?
You can't all get to the top.
You can't make your own luck.
Me, I was always lucky.
Mind you, I was good too.
Granddad. I must talk to you some time.
- Of course. What about?
- It's about Dad.
Oh, yes. Later.
- It makes you proud.
- The ambassador I was telling you about.
Sir something Pearson, his name was.
Charming fellow. Absolutely the best type.
Told me I was his favourite comedian.
Barring George Robey.
Tonight is a great occasion for one of our most distinguished members.
He's just had very good news about someone in his family.
I'm sure you'll all want to join with me in drinking his health.
Billy Rice!
I'm going to ask him to do us the honour of singing some of his favourite songs.
(cries of encouragement)
Look at him. You wouldn't remember him properly, would you?
No, no. I don't want that thing.
The so-called government we've got today
Are cutting down expenses, so they say
To save a few odd million, more or less
They want to scrap the navy. Do they?
(all) Yes!
We know they're broke, well, I'm broke
So are you broke, we're all broke
As we were when Bolingbroke first sailed away
But we've got the men, we've got the ships
What's more, we've got the water
And it's just as wet as in Lord Nelson's day
So don't let 'em scrap the British navy
Don't let 'em scrap our men o' war
What do we care if the income tax is twelve bob in the pound?
We can owe it like we've always done before
Let Winston say ta-ta to all the tartars he adores
But not ta-ta to all the tars that guard our English shores
Let him scrap his high hats, squash hats, straw hats and velours
But they mustn't never scrap, no!
They mustn't never scrap, no!
They mustn't never scrap the British navy
For I'm sure you'll agree
That a fellow like me
Is the salt of our dear old country
Of our dear old country
(orchestra mimicking explosions)
But when our heritage is threatened
At home or across the sea
It's chaps like us - yes, you and me
Who'll march again to victory
Some people say we're finished
Some people say we're done
But if we all stand
By this dear old land
(Land Of Hope And Glory)
- Don't look sour.
- You would if you'd been messed about.
You'll get what's coming to you.
The battle will be won
Thank God we're normal, normal, normal
Yes, thank God we're normal, we are the country's flower
And when the great call comes
Someone will gaze down on us and say
They make no fuss
For this was their finest shower
Yes, this was their finest shower
So thank God we're normal, normal, normal
Yes, thank God we're normal
For this was their finest shower
- What do you mean?
- There's a new show.
Backed to the limit. I've a new backer.
(piano music on radio)
(door bell)
(music ends)
And now a request from Mrs Connie
Morris of Northwood, Middlesex,
for her husband, Flight Sergeant Ozzie
Morris, who is serving in the Middle East.
Sorry, I've forgotten my key.
I don't like to answer the door in case it's a policeman with another summons.
There'll be a policeman at the door all right.
- I do hope Archie won't be long.
- Well, Frank's with him.
Frank's a sensible boy.
He'll see he doesn't stay out too late.
Archie's a fool. Always got some big idea he's going to make money.
A while ago it was female impersonators.
We were going to make a packet.
But by the time Archie got started on it, it had all petered out.
Oh, well. It's no good worrying.
It says on the telly that Mick's coming home and that's all that really matters.
- Come on. Have a drop of this.
- Not for me, thanks.
Getting low on the drink.
You need something to eat. You've had nothing but tea and cigarettes for days.
- I couldn't eat anything.
- People have got to eat.
"People have got to eat" she says.
That's a good one.
- You can't carry on...
- "People have got to eat" she said.
- Where's he got to?
- He's gone into the kitchen.
That's not all they've got to do. They've got to do things you don't know about.
- I know, love. Things have been tough.
- You're a very sweet girl, Jean.
- But you're not even my own daughter.
- All right, I'm sorry.
- Don't presume too much.
- I just said...
- Don't presume too much!
- Let me get you some tea.
Why doesn't Archie come back?
You'd think he'd come back here and celebrate after hearing his son was safe.
- I don't know. You people...
- Don't let's have a row. It's silly.
It's not silly.
Anyway, who said we were having a row?
All I said was that I wasn't hungry.
And you start getting at me.
- I wasn't getting at you.
- I can't eat.
You don't know what it's like.
We've lived on penny pieces of bacon and what we've got from the tribunal.
- You're all alike.
- We should have stayed.
Archie, I'm talking to Jean.
I thought you were.
I sized up the situation in a flash.
It's easy for people like you to make fun.
I left school when I was 12 years old.
If she tells me that once more
I'll get up on this roof, drunk as I am, I shall get up and scream.
I've never done that before.
You had to pay sixpence a week.
Some weeks my mother couldn't find it.
But this is a welfare state, my darling.
Nobody wants, nobody goes without.
- I was scrubbing a dining hall...
- Everybody's all right.
- Young Mick's all right, Frank, Jean...
- I wish you'd both shut up.
She'll make it up with old Graham and forget all about silly old Trafalgar Square.
You don't understand.
Phoebe scrubbed a dining-hall floor for 500 kids when she was 12 years old.
Have you any idea how often she's told me about those kids and that hall?
- Oh, shut up.
- OK, son. Pass one of those to Jean.
- She looks as though she could use it.
- Every night's a party night.
And do you know why? Look at her.
Look at that poor, pathetic old thing there.
She's very drunk.
And her untrained mind is racing because her blood's full of alcohol we can't afford.
- What's he talking about?
- She's tired and she's getting old.
She's tired of me. Nobody ever gave her very much except me.
And my God, she's tired of that.
Aren't you, my old darling?
I tried to make something of myself.
I really did try.
I was nothing much to look at.
I was a plain kid.
No, I wasn't. I wasn't even plain.
I was the ugliest bloody kid you ever saw in your life.
But I made something of myself.
I made him want me.
- It was a long time ago.
- Have a row, but can it be a quiet row?
Stop yelling, I can't hear myself shout.
Sing us a song, there's a good boy.
- Where's the old man?
- In the kitchen.
Billy, come out of there.
You know you're only reading.
What's he doing messing in there?
He knows I don't like him being in there.
Leaves everything in such a mess.
- You've been at that cake.
- What?
- You've been at my cake.
- I was hungry.
But that cake was for Mick.
It wasn't for you.
- I'm sorry.
- I bought it for when he comes home.
- Why couldn't you leave it alone?
- I just fancied it.
Couldn't you leave it alone?
It wasn't for you.
What's the matter with you?
I feed you, don't I?
Don't think you give me all that much money every week.
- Forget it.
- I won't.
- We'll buy another.
- You'll buy another!
You're so rich.
You're such a great big success!
What's a little cake?
We'll order a dozen of them.
Well, I bought that cake.
And it cost me 30 shillings.
It was for Mick.
Because I wanted to give him something.
Something that I know he'll like after going through what he has.
And now that bloody greedy old pig.
That old pig!
As if he hasn't had enough of everything already, he's got to get his fingers in it!
(wails in despair)
Excuse me, Jean.
Well, I suppose he's had more out of life than any of us and he's enjoyed it.
Good luck to him.
All the same, you needn't have done that.
I'm so sorry, Archie.
Please try and forgive me.
Come on, love! Pull yourself together.
We should have all done that years ago.
Let's all pull ourselves together, together, together
Let's pull ourselves together and the happier we'll be
That's right. Remember we're British.
Don't worry, Jean. You won't have to endure this much longer.
Phoebe, let's see you do your dance.
Jean, play something. She dances well.
I wonder if she'll make me cry tonight.
We'll see. Frank, sing us a song.
When there isn't a girl about you feel so Ionely
When there isn't a girl about...
Wait a minute.
I'm just trying to remember...
The girl I love is up in the lavatory...
Archie, no. Not like that. It's rude.
- You sing it, Phoebe.
- No, I can't sing.
All right, then.
The boy I love, he's up in the gallery
The boy I love, he's smiling now at me
Where is he? Can't you see?
Waving his handkerchief
As merry as a robin that sings on a tree
- Jolly good, old girl.
- No, it sounded bloody awful.
- This letter's from Claire.
- May I have another cup of tea?
Just a minute. I want to read it.
I want you to listen too.
Claire's my niece, the one in Canada.
John's daughter.
They're all there now, my brother John as well.
They started off in the restaurant business with $500. There's their little girl.
Now they have a hotel in Toronto.
And they're opening another.
You don't have to look interested.
She's not interested in that.
- Of course she's interested.
- Frank, would you get me another tea?
I'm only trying to explain to her.
They've got this one hotel in Toronto.
Now they're opening one in Ottawa.
John manages the hotel in Toronto for them and now they want us to go out there and for Archie to manage the hotel in Ottawa.
- What do I know about hotels?
- He gets cross if I mention it.
Don't say that once more.
You've mentioned it and I'm not cross.
I just think it's a bloody pointless idea.
Anyway, you can't get draught Bass in Canada.
- I'm going to the theatre.
- Do you want dinner?
I don't think so.
I'll grab a bite somewhere.
Jean, why don't you bring some fish and chips to the old dump?
Remember, when you were a kid?
I'll bring the champagne.
I don't often see my little daughter. Ta-ta.
Bye.
He doesn't like me talking about it.
But we needn't decide for a month or two.
- What about the boys?
- They can come too if they want.
I don't know about Mick, but Frank likes the idea.
- Do you, Frank?
- Well, take a look around you.
Can you think of any good reason for staying in this cosy corner of Europe?
Who are you? You're nobody.
You're nobody, you've no money and you're young.
And when you're not, you'll still have no money, you'll still be nobody and the only difference is you'll be old.
Sometimes I think you're the only sensible one of any of us.
Here we are. Champagne.
Remember when I picked you up at the bottom here?
You'd been very naughty on the toboggan.
(laughs)
- Phoebe seems very keen on Canada.
- Yeah.
- I went to Canada during the war.
- I remember.
Couldn't get draught Bass, not even in Toronto.
Seemed to think that was pretty English.
Didn't seem very English to me.
That Trafalgar Square thing.
Did you really believe in all that?
I thought I did at the time.
Like me and draught Bass and women, eh?
- Are you meeting someone?
- No.
Just a man about some scenery.
Got half an hour.
Phoebe seems to have set her heart on it.
Your mother...
Your mother caught me in bed with Phoebe.
I didn't know.
I don't know what I really expected, but I expected you to say more than that.
You'd...
You'd just been born.
And your mother caught poor old Phoebe and me together.
Poor old Phoebe.
She's never even enjoyed it very much.
Anyway, your mother walked out.
She walked out just like that.
She was what you'd call a person of... a person of principle.
You mean, you didn't love my mother?
Yes. I loved her.
I was in love with her.
Whatever that may mean.
Anyway, a few months later she was dead. That was that.
Tell me something. Will you?
I want you to tell me something.
Well, what would you say to a man of my age marrying a girl of... about... your age?
Oh, Dad!
You're not serious.
You couldn't.
You couldn't do a thing like that to Phoebe.
You've been away from your old man a bit too long.
- My scenery man. Got to go.
- Where are you meeting him?
- At the Rockcliffe.
- I'll walk down with you.
Don't bother. I'm in a bit of a rush.
Why don't you take old Phoebe to the pictures?
Here you are, love. Thanks.
- What's the matter, Jean?
- It's Archie.
- What is it now?
- A girl.
- That's nothing new.
- He's thinking of marrying this one.
- I don't believe it.
- It's true.
- What about Phoebe?
- Exactly.
- Who is it?
- She was in the beauty competition.
Tina Lapford. She won second prize.
Daughter of some bakery people in Burnley.
They must be quite well off.
Here's the end of the ride.
Come along, my dear.
- Let me help you down.
- Thank you, Granddad.
You know, I wonder...
He was with her and her parents yesterday at Stocks's café.
Do you suppose that he's pretending we don't exist?
I don't know.
Her parents are here, you say?
They're staying at the holiday camp.
Part of the prize.
Damn waste of money.
Town hall pays and shoves it on the rates.
Granddad, will you walk down to the station with me to meet Graham?
- You'll want to be alone.
- No, I'd love you to come.
I've got some business to do.
Bye-bye, Jean.
Bye.
- Can I speak to Mrs Lapford?
- I'll find out if she's in the camp, sir.
Calling Mrs Lapford. Please go to
reception, where friends are waiting.
Mrs Lapford? That's me.
What can I be wanted for?
I wonder what they could want.
Hang on. I can hear him coming now.
- Call, Mr Rice.
- Not now.
She's called twice.
Female named Lapford.
- Could I have your autograph?
- Shh!
Hello? Archie Rice speaking.
Yes.
(angry female voice)
No. Look, wait a minute.
I don't understand. What's wrong?
I don't understand. There's evidently some misunderstanding.
Well, look...
Don't be a cow and stand there. Get out.
No, I'm sorry. Look.
Let me ring back, will you?
What do you mean, the last time?
It's ridiculous.
Is Tina there?
Can I speak to her, please? Why not?
Who? Who's been telling you all this?
Who?!
I'm sure... He couldn't have.
On stage, everybody!
He couldn't have understood.
Listen, Mrs Lapford.
I want her... I meant it, I want her in the show and I want her to be the star.
And I want her too. Tell her that.
No, you can't.
I'm depending on you. You promised.
Everything's fixed up.
I've paid out cheques.
Yes.
Yes, it's true.
Seven years ago, that's right.
Still in the receiver's.
Well, you didn't ask me.
Well, for God's sake, give me some time.
At least let me come and see you.
(hangs up)
On stage.
Mr Rice, could I have your autograph?
You look so daft.
- That was Mrs Moneybags, wasn't it?
- Shut up!
You've mucked it up, haven't you?
I said you've mucked it up!
- Gawd, you need a keeper.
- (Frank) What's the matter?
(music starts on stage)
- Dad, what's the matter?
- Shut up. Shut the door.
Just a second. Hey, John.
Take these costumes down to the girls for me.
Check the board and tell Charlie to keep going. Be about two minutes.
- Got all that?
- Yep.
- Dad, what's got into you?
- That's it.
Who do you think narked?
Shopped me? Grassed?
- Better get used to prison language.
- What are you on about?
The show. The old man.
My old man, Billy Rice. Old-time favourite.
- The new show. It's finished.
- What's Granddad got to do with that?
There's no time to explain that now.
Better get on the blower to everybody, make all cancellations. Every single thing.
Oh no, it's too late now. Send wires.
- Does Harold know?
- Oh, God.
Tell Harold... Get Harold...
Get him on the blower for me as soon as I come off after the first act.
(knocking)
OK. Curtain up.
What happened, Archie?
- He's still with us. That's something.
- Will you not be doing the new show?
- Just give me a chance.
- You had your chance, mate. And ours.
(upbeat music and thin applause)
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
- (music drowns him out)
Does he think he's funny?
- Shut up!
- (music stops)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Archie Rice is the name. Mrs Rice's favourite boy.
We're going to entertain you for the next two and a half hours... half hours... Whoo!
I want to see your father.
I'll be in his dressing room.
All right, Granddad.
Now I'm going to introduce to you
Beryl and BoBo, the trampoline tramps.
You swine. These kids have turned down other work for you.
- I'll see what I can do.
- We know what you can do.
I'll get lawyers and I'II...
- What about you lot? Not interested?
- He didn't want us anyway.
Take your spoon out of the mixing bowl and get ready.
I don't care about the bloody money, but I'm owing the bookie 15 quid.
Look, be a pal and forget it, would you?
- How can I? I paid it in.
- You paid it in?
- Of course.
- When?
Yesterday. And I've made out payments on the strength of it.
- You'd better think about...
- OK, Harold.
Granddad's arrived.
He's in your dressing room.
Look. Wire Jimmy Collins.
"Cancel shoes order. Snags. Archie."
- And try and get Lennie again.
- Archie!
- Not now, dear.
- It's not fair, Frank. (grumbles)
- Frank, I've lost one of me scallops.
- You'll have to turn sideways then, dear.
Before you say anything, I had to do it to stop you making a fool of yourself.
- You stopped me. Congratulations.
- I didn't know about this financial thing.
I like that phrase. "This financial thing".
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
I realise I've put you in a bit of a spot.
- "Bit of a spot."
- Look, I've had an idea.
I'll come in with you. How's that?
- You mean to jail, dear?
- My name's still worth something.
We'll give 'em the old songs.
People still want them, you know.
What about it? What do you say?
- God help you.
- Archie...
Listen, Frank. Maybe you can understand.
His mind's going.
I'm an undischarged bankrupt, see?
I do everything in my wife's name.
But just this once I signed the cheques myself, for very obvious reasons.
- Cripes! You really are...
- Archie, listen.
Listen, son. Just no more interference.
Yes? Thank you.
I've got a few pounds in the post office.
- You're on again.
- It's not much, but it's a few pounds.
I'd like you to have it.
I didn't mean it. Doesn't he know?
I didn't mean it.
(applause)
Why should I care?
Why should I let it touch me?
Why shouldn't I
Sit down and try to let it pass over me?
Why should they stare?
Why should I let it get me?
What's the use of despair
If they call you a square?
You're a long time dead...
Thank you.
Thanks.
- He's a bit down tonight.
- Is he?
- Seems all right to me.
- Does he?
(song ends)
I'm not much in the mood for a show, I suppose.
What happened about the Africa job?
- I turned it down.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Something like it'll turn up again.
Something like you might not.
I can't leave here yet. I'm too involved.
- You do understand, don't you?
- I'm beginning to.
Whatever it is, you're up to your ears in it.
- I'm not much help, am I?
- You've been patient. I don't know why.
Because I love you. That's why.
- You'd still rather I went back to London?
- Yes.
It's not that I don't want you to stay, but... there's something I must see Dad about.
- Would you like me to come with you?
- I'd rather you didn't.
Not tonight.
All right.
She'd steal your knickers and sell them for dusters.
- Jean!
- Mrs Roberts. I always used to say that.
What are you talking about, you right-wing old poop?
- Old poop maybe, but not right-wing.
- Can we talk?
- Your dad's a bit slewed.
- I don't want any. I want to talk to Dad.
I'm talking to Frank about my landlady.
She always used to remind me of a bloke I used to know.
- Listen, this'll interest you.
- I want to talk to you about Phoebe.
He was Irish and he did a trampoline act.
We called him Lady Rosie Bothways.
The end of me old cigar
Oh, shut up, Frank!
What's the matter with you? Don't you care what's going to happen to Phoebe?
Jeannie, love. Shall I tell you something?
All my life I've been searching for something.
A draught Bass you could drink all night without running off every ten minutes, without feeling sick, and all for fourpence.
The man who could offer me that would really get my vote.
Oh, he's funny. Archie, you're a bit of a bastard, you really are.
- Insult me. I don't mind.
- Don't start being humble.
- What's the matter with her?
- Don't ask me.
You can't hurt yourself any more, can you?
- Why don't you leave him alone?
- That's right.
He doesn't give a damn about anyone.
He's two pen'orth of nothing.
- That sums me up.
- Leave him alone.
He wants to divorce Phoebe.
What's going to happen to her?
You can't change anybody.
Have you seen this girl he wants to marry?
I caught them together yesterday.
She's a professional virgin.
If you're going to start that,
I'm going home.
She's pretty, spoilt, vain and stupid.
Her parents are probably stupid too.
- How old is she?
I suppose you think you're going to get them to put up money for this new show.
- That was the idea.
- What do you mean "was the idea"?
Well, before you started getting fussed about it, old Billy went and did something.
He went and saw my little girlfriend's parents and he... told them.
Unfortunately he did not realise that in the meantime I had signed a few cheques.
- He scotched it?
- Oh, yes. Completely.
So you needn't worry.
About Phoebe, anyway.
Old Archie isn't going to get his oats after all.
("Why Should I Care?" plays on piano)
Dad...
Yeah?
Oh, I... (sniffs)
You're like your mother.
She always felt everything very deeply.
Much more deeply than I did.
You're what they call a sentimentalist.
- What are you talking about now?
- (laughs) I know.
You think I'm just a tatty old music-hall actor.
But you know, when you're up here...
When you're up here... you think you love all those people around you out there.
But you don't.
You don't love them like...
Oh, if you learn it properly you get yourself a technique.
And smile, darn you, smile and look the friendliest, jolliest thing in the world.
But you'll be just dead and used up.
Just like everybody else.
See this face?
This face can split open with warmth and humanity.
It can sing.
Tell the worst, unfunniest stories in the world to a great mob of dead, drab erks.
And it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter because look.
Look at my eyes.
I'm dead behind these eyes.
I'm dead.
Just like the whole damn shoddy lot out there.
Hey.
Did I ever tell you the most moving thing I ever heard?
- Oh, Dad...
- No, no, it's not a gag.
It was when I was in Canada.
I used to slip over the border sometimes.
One night I heard some Negress singing in a bar.
If ever I saw any hope or strength in the human race, it was in the face of that old fat Negress getting up to sing about...
Jesus, or something like that.
I never even liked that kind of music, but to see that old bag singing her heart out to the whole world...
And you knew somehow that it didn't matter how much you kicked people, how much you despised them.
If they can get up and make a pure, natural noise like that, there's nothing wrong with them.
If I'd done one thing as good as that in my whole life,
I'd have been all right.
I wish to God I was that old bag.
I'd stand up and shake my great bosom up and down and lift up my head and make the most beautiful fuss in the world.
Dear God, I would.
But I'll never do it.
Do you think you're going to do it?
Well, do you?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
I'll probably do exactly the same as you.
Of course you will.
Mind you, you'll make a better job of it.
You're more clever.
(Phoebe) Archie.
Aren't you coming home?
Frank sent me here.
There's a policeman outside asking for you. What do you think he wants?
It's the income tax man.
I've been expecting him for 20 years.
Don't look so scared, Phoebe, love.
Old Archie's drunk again.
It's only the income tax man.
The policeman's outside with Frank.
What do you think he wants, Archie?
Bastards. The rotten bastards.
They've killed him.
They've killed Mick.
O Lord
I don't care where they
Bury my body
No, I don't care where they
Bury my body
Cos my soul's gonna live with God
Quick march!
- They're giving him quite a sendoff.
- They say he'll get the VC.
What will they do, send it on to him?
- Could I have a photograph?
- Oh, please.
- Who are you?
- I'm the boy's uncle.
- They've got a job to do.
- Don't think they're not enjoying it.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right, dear.
- I'd like to go now.
- Just one last question.
I do realise that this is a very difficult situation.
I wonder if you could spare me a few minutes.
All right, boys. Wrap it up.
Bum.
About this story - this is how I've angled it:
"The background of a hero".
I thought we could do something with those patriotic songs you sing in your act.
That's... They're my own material.
I don't think...
- How's the show going?
- Eh? Oh, well...
People just sit back and stare at you.
They just sit. But London, that's the place.
You're not planning a comeback by any chance, are you?
No return to the stage?
- He's retired.
- Pity.
There's nothing like the old music hall.
Well, thank you so much, Mr Rice.
Please accept my sympathy...
- They look as if they're about to go now.
- I'll pay all your debts, settle everything.
- I'll see that nothing happens.
- You're the one to persuade him, Bill.
Only don't tell him that I asked you.
Frank's all set to go, aren't you?
- Could we have that? Want some, Dad?
- Yes.
Brother Bill. Admiring the view?
Worth the climb, isn't it?
Frank's been telling me about
Claire's letter. I'm willing to help.
I'll pay all your fares and you can start a fresh life. The three of you.
What's the matter, son?
You want to be a Mountie?
We could all be together.
Bill would look after everything.
- When's the London train?
- 9 o'clock.
- Who are we seeing? Rubens?
- No, Klein.
- Charlie Klein?!
- What are you going to London for?
It's about a new show.
He's coming to make it look respectable.
Why don't you come too?
You can see Graham.
Afternoon. Mr Klein, please.
- Who shall I say?
- Mr Billy Rice, Mr Archie Rice.
Will you take a seat, please?
Charlie Klein's all right. I used to know him when he was about Jeannie's age.
Put him up for my club.
As soon as I heard the name Rice,
I said to myself "It can't be!"
Nice to see you. How are you, Archie?
Let's come into the office.
You're getting younger and younger.
You're looking wonderful.
Wait for us in the pub next door, will you?
Won't be long.
We all had our own style, our own songs, and we were all English.
What's more, we spoke English.
Ah! There you are, Jean.
We knew what the rules were.
Even if we spent half our time making people laugh at them, we never suggested anyone should break 'em.
- What are you having to drink?
- Scotch.
- Scotch all round, please.
- A real pro is like the run of people.
Only he's a lot more like them than they are themselves.
Hey, Billy. See who that is?
Eddie Trimmer!
Eddie, my favourite comedian.
Archie, I love your dad.
He's such a sweet old man.
And still a first-class performer.
Still a first-class performer.
It's going to be great to see him up there again.
What are you doing? You're not going to put him back into the business?
It's our only chance.
Klein wouldn't look at me.
- Old Billy's sold on this idea himself.
- And you're going to let him do it?
You'll kill that old man.
Just to save that tatty show of yours.
It isn't to save that tatty show of mine.
It's to save your tatty dad from jail.
They may not come in to see Archie, but they may remember Billy Rice.
Worth a try, anyway.
He wants to do it. Look at him, poor old gubbins. Top of the bill again.
With your lips close to the telephone
When they might be close to mine
Well, here's to the Billy Rice show at the Winter Gardens Illuminations Week!
(orchestra plays jaunty overture)
(music continues)
- Have you seen the old man?
- Yeah, he's OK. Jean's with him.
Frank, we're stuck!
Pour a bucket of water over 'em.
Oh dear, I've made a mess of this.
Don't bother about it. Wipe it off.
It's your face they've come to see.
- Do you want a drink?
- No, no. Not before the show.
- Granddad? Overture.
- Already?
- Don't worry. I'll be down.
- He's nearly ready.
After "Put Me Amongst the Girls" it's my first change.
I'll have everything down.
- Good luck.
- Good luck, Mr Rice.
Thank you!
Once I get that backcloth behind me
I can hold them for half an hour.
I'll see those five-minute microphone wonders out any day.
- Did you realise what time it is?
- Don't worry.
He's on his way down now.
- I'm getting a problem with the voltage.
- Don't be trouble.
- Is the overture on?
- You've got a good two minutes.
- You look great.
- Thank you.
- Warn the orchestra.
- He's not ready yet.
It's all right, love.
You've got a good minute.
- Good luck, Billy.
- And the same to you.
Always be nice to them on the way up in case you need them on the way down.
Put me amongst the girls
Put me amongst the girls
Do me a favour, do
You know I'd do as much for you
- Are you ready, Granddad?
- Yes.
- We're coughing better tonight.
- Yes.
Put me amongst the girls
Those with the curly curls
They'll enjoy themselves and so will I
If you put me amongst the girls
Tell Rita to keep going. Get a chair.
- What's the matter?
- It's my breath.
Brandy, quick, someone!
Renee!
- What?
- Something's happened to Granddad.
- You've got to go on again.
- What?
- What is it?
- Stand by to go on again.
- It's so hot.
- Give us the bottle.
- A little snifter.
- No, I'm all right. I'm all right.
- Go on. Do a reprise.
- I've got to go on now.
No, Dad. No... Billy!
Put me amongst the girls
Carry on.
Put me amongst the girls
Do me a favour, do
You know I'd do as much for you
Put me amongst the girls
Those with the curly curls
(song continues)
I'm sorry.
(song fades out)
- Jean thinks I killed him.
- You didn't kill him, Archie.
He was such a sweet old man.
Do you know who said that?
Charlie Klein.
He said old Billy was the nicest old man in the business.
Klein's cancelling the show as soon as he gets a replacement.
I've booked your tickets to Canada.
I'm going anyway, Dad. So you'd better start thinking about number one.
Can't get draught Bass in Canada.
I've tried it.
I'm not doing anything for you to stay here. Not any more.
It's Canada or jail.
You know, I always thought
I should go to jail.
I should think it must be quite interesting.
Sure to meet some people I know.
Oh, well. Just two more performances.
Seems a pity, though.
I'd like to have notched up
21 years against the income tax man.
I'll never make my 21st now. It would have been fun to get the key of the door.
Why should I care?
Why should I let it touch me?
Why shouldn't I
Sit down and try to let it pass over me?
Why should they stare?
Why should I let it get me?
(Archie tap-dancing)
Mr Klein.
What's he up to, saying he can carry on next week?
- He said that?
- Yes, to all these people.
I was meant to be in Blackpool, but I had to come all the way down here to fix this.
I'm telling you, he's out. Finished!
Why should I care?
Why should I let it touch me?
Why shouldn't I
Sit down and try to let it pass over me?
Why...
(orchestra plays on)
There's a bloke out here with a hook.
You know that, don't you?
He's standing there. I can see him.
Must be the income tax man.
- This show finishes tonight.
- Yes, Mr Klein.
(Klein) This show finishes tonight.
Why should I care?
Why should I let it touch me?
Why shouldn't I
Sit down and try to let it pass over me?
Why...
Why should I let it get me?
What's the use of despair...
(orchestra plays on)
If they see that you're blue they'll look down on you
So why oh why should I
(music stops)
Oh, well. I have a go. Don't I, ladies?
I do. I have a go.
You've been a good audience. Very good.
A very good audience.
Let me know where you're working tomorrow night.
I'll come and see you.
(talking and scattered clapping)
(orchestra plays upbeat tune)

Continue to touch.
Let's take all these covers?
It will become Heavy...
...will be missed on board.
We must learn modes and speak words of poets and philosophers...
If we freeze we need < br /> the covers.
We must be strong, as Nietzsche tells us.
'And fight to the infinite.'
There is Europe, heaven and earth waiting to beautify it.
London, Paris, Berlin,
Florence, Athens...
Besieged museums, as occupied Paris Bastille.
We will bring to America,
Greek art that had been lost.
Igniting the spark.
Raymond, come.

Gragas Islands...
...where Sappho loved the song. cradle of the arts of war and peace.'
I need more space.

It is a more democratic form of theater.
Everyone can see well.

Duncan's family is very grateful,
Mrs. Campbell.

Raymond played the flute, and I danced.
A nice Lady appears, wrapped in furs...
And ask?
'Where in the world are you?'
'In no part the world, 'said...
' We came from the moon.'
I'm fascinated, where he learned to dance.
I never learned, danced in the belly of my mother...
Exciting.
My father was a man unstable, he abandoned us.
My mother was inconsolable.
Just ate oysters and champagne...
...is the food of Aphrodite.
So I danced before birth.
It's a metaphor? Not.
No, it's my destiny. </ P> Roger.

Not true, every time we touch on the subject...
...she tries to dissuade me.
To protect you </ p >.
I know. I'm old and fat...
Do you think I do not know.

Whether or not.

And tea is one of those things.

I can be a nasty old...
...but I still have beautiful arms.
The arms are the last charm that a woman loses.

Just think... in Paris at dawn.

Waiter.
Do you know a man who is driving a Bugatti.

As always beautiful.
Especially today...
Because I'm rich and I'm in love.
We are looking for a nice young man. just gone.

Martin Bedford is here.
He will join us.
It is a artist?
An aspirant. is brilliant?
It's very rich.
How do you Duncan? remarkably well.
I always wanted to meet her.
My mother saw her dancing in London.
Continue...</ p >.
She loves me?
You do not have their own point of view.
That's not what I meant...
So why mention it?
You are a legend of his time, not.
A legend in my time...
...has just offend me in a horrible way.
And the new book, Archer.
I do not know. I only write things...
Lamb evolve to a lion.
We all have a little lions.
I totally agree.
- Why?
Because I love lions.
Wait a minute.
Let's get some rest.
No. Do not stop. </ P>
Dance again. </ P> Please.
Who's there? </ P> My name is Craig. </ P>.
I am a decorator, set designer.
Thanks.
You do not know me yet...
I saw you dancing, before the blue curtains in Paris.
I could not believe it.
It's exactly as I imagined.
I had to see her alone. </ p >
It would have been terrible...
...talking in the middle of a lot of people.
I had to be safe.
Eu tinha que vê-la sozinha.
Teria sido terrível falar no meio de um monte de gente.
Eu tinha que estar seguro. sure.
You.
Is it safe now?
It is extraordinary.
Meeting.
My dear, we are getting married.
I can not, I have commitments.
Nonsense. Who? </ P> My mother-. -Who.
Your mother... The meeting between
Gordon Craig and Isadora Duncan...
...can not take place because.
Miss Duncan has his mother. </ P> I know all...
...about the family circus
< br /> with travelers.
It is not a circus.
An artist does not need a family.
I have no family and never I have one.
I have my mother.
It is a great artist.
She understands me.
I have a job to be done:
Ela é uma grande artista.
Ela me entende.
Eu tenho um trabalho a ser feito:
Create a world stage, a new unit...
...for the actor, designers and dancers...
...where the dancer will dance with the light that I create.
My light and My decoration.
The World on stage is my inspiration.
Enter.
.. Feel at home.
Do not be standing in the doorway...
Among... Look at this...</ p > See... is a possible version of their choreography.
It's beautiful.
It's true...
And this... let's see.
I designed this for the first act of Hamlet.
The light pattern is the same as this, the same design. </ p >...
It's beautiful.
- More than this, is an entirely new decor.
I could not believe when
I saw her dancing...
I thought I was having a vision, because I made that up.
I did not know this existed.
We were two strangers, as two stars in the same sky, who have crossed and are united, by fate.
Stop in the light.
Very good.
There is absolutely, as I thought.
And what did you expect?
There are two theories...
One is that you would be a kind of ruler of Milwaukee, who plays on the stage barefoot, very well behaved.
That's what they think?
Some, yes.
Others feel that, her dancing is indecent. all say it is 'a great artist.'
And you, what do you think?
They do not see what I see in you.
The priestess, the revolutionary.
Really? And what else? </ P> What are two parts with one head, need to come together. </ P>
Soulmates. As brothers...
...together for the glory.
They went together, no mortal could separates them, armor black as night.
Enough talk... Take a moment.
Take these sandals. </ P> A woman of Eros not need them. </ P> Magnificent.
Magnificent.
Yes, I know.
You belong to me.
Ted... I was thinking.
I always tell everybody,
Sim, eu sei.
Você pertence a mim.
Ted... estava pensando.
Sempre digo a todo mundo, if anything is sacred the human body is.
I thought I knew what I was saying... Wrong
Not yet had you known.
Why did not I say when a man is beautiful.
Well.
If we can capture before it moves, we the moonlight when we want.
Will you let me paint too?
No, I paint, you dance.
Dance to immobilize the moon. moon, which is in heaven...
...my beloved tries to capture its light for ever.
Oh Moon. Stop your brightness, you as my beloved pictures.
</ P> Then she stopped...
...moving? </ P> No, it only obeys the virgins.
I challenge thee, Moon.
Não, ela só obedece as virgens.
Eu te desafio, lua.
Do not walk on it, is ruining all of my work.
Ruined my drawing.
You paint all purple, scarlet woman.
You will see.
Food.
Do not say anything, I know that is bread and sausage.
A bit expensive, do not eat anything.
And to drink?
- Syrup.
I saw one of his posters.
'Show canceled due to the unwillingness <br / > Miss Duncan.'
Miss Duncan is sick and can not dance.
I feel very bad.
What day is it? </ p >.
Friday.
Friday, we are here for a week.
My mother must be on the verge of madness.
Now you can talk about your business.
Well, Miss Duncan had an upset.
Yes, a reprehensible act.
You are a woman without morals.
True, true. can die of love.
Archer, what next?
Continue... I do not know the lyrics.
Someone must know the lyrics.
Do you know the lyrics to Charleston?
No, ma'am.
No one know the lyrics? Who know he could sing.
Mr. Bedford, know some of your time?
Whether singing.
I think I know, 'Everybody Loves My Baby
.' </ P> Great, sing.
No, do not stop.
It's terrible.
Where did you learn this, how awful.
I'm sorry...
- It's stupid. Stupid...
Desculpe...
- É estúpido. Estúpido.
You know what I said when I was asked my opinion about jazz...
'Jazz is the left foot of Isadora Duncan.'
Mary, my star...
- Isadora, I'm going back.
We are going to Paris.
No, it's late, we will tomorrow.
Tomorrow does not exist.
Mary. Asked the foreman, what's his name? </ P> No, but come here many times.
Paris-What then wait.
Isadora, we will off.
- Archer will give a party tonight.
I'm tired, I will.

Mom wanted me to protect from prying eyes...
There is much to hide.
Do you know how she calls me?
'The vile seducer '...
When you said this is his nickname.
In the scene of Indians, <br / > the train gold, gold will have an effect.
In the play the King and Queen, the scene outside cover the entire bottom of the central area.
When Hamlet stabs Polonius,
Claudius appears...
...before, his shadow is cast in Hamlet.
It's wonderful.
Yes, it's wonderful.
We should test this in Moscow. of impatience.
You should come to me, after solve it.
Yes, yes I will.
He directed to me, and almost killed me.
We had never spoken before, and fetched me this beautiful Bugatti.
I would buy one, if I had money.
I thought you were rich.
- I'm rich for other things, but not to buy a Bugatti.
You're rich, right?
Do not say that.
I thought I was rich.
I have a certain facility.
How so?
If you have a ' relative ease,'.
I would buy a Bugatti?
- No. </ p > I can not think...
...better way to spend than being complacent.
To me, yes. not want it on my desk.
Isadora, is not intransigent
- Archer, tell him to leave.
I agree, I am gone. < br /> I wait for you.
No, someone better make her company.
Do not talk to me in that tone.
Good-night.
Why say that?
And you, because these things also said.
If a girl call it Deirdre.
Deirdre.
Deirdre...
This will invigorate you.
- I feel good.
You need to rest... The baby.
- I'm not tired. </ P> Mom, stop knitting.
It's better than doing nothing. </ P>-Try.
- I do not want.
I do not want to spend my life surrounded by women...
Tente.
- Eu não quero.
Não quero passar minha vida rodeada de mulheres...
...embroidery, sewing.
I'm an artist.
Ted too.
If it was an honest man, was married
. </ p >.
Mother, I do not want.
I did not intend to marry, even if he was not married,
I would not marry...
We've talked about it and I understood.
You can not do that.
Mom, please...
Do not cry, I need you.
I need you, do not cry.
Of course I dream of a life together with Ted and the child,

- Not many people here.
I do not speak of society...
You hit my ball. is allowed.
It's the game.
Still out of the game.
I thank you.
You I make life difficult, Isadora...
...socially speaking. would be different if we had married.
We are not we?
- Why not to marry?
For principles. marry, have to stand for everything that happens, not your destiny.
Am I entitled to another turn.
It is an extremely difficult woman, you know.
What do you want? You can work here. </ P>.
I proposed hiring an orchestra.
</ P> I do not need an...
...orchestra. </ P> Perfect. </
P> Then I'll hire a pianist.
A nice young pianist.
Mr. Armand De Brey.
Coward.
They say it is a good pianist.
It is disgusting.
This is what I say.
I'll hide it behind a curtain.
It looks like a frog.
Why do not forbid me to see it.
Isadora.
Armond, touch until I tell you to stop.
Touch.
Por que me proíbe de vê-la,
Isadora?

And spend the spring in the Nile.

There is no reason for you to stop dancing.

The soul shines in your eyes.

I'm sad to leave him, but I have to go.
Great.
Tuesday-I said.
Well, is determined.
Do not bother.
Isadora,

Ok, we'll look at another momemto.
Bem, está decidido.
- Não se incomoda?
Isadora, estou no meio de um tratamento.
Ok, falaremos em outro momemto. will take you to the Frog Prince.
What?
I do not understand.
Do not you understand?
'History the frog that turns into a prince '
' Only the princess can see who really was the frog '.
Do you think my servants do not tell me everything?
Was spying on me?
- It is a scandal, everyone knows.
What-ordinary.
- I spend well I want loyalty.
Fidelity is one of my most salient features.
So I'm in love, a genial man, < br /> your soul shines in your eyes.
A man-hungry... Go and take your frog.
Do not see why not <br / > has a soul. And if you have..
Suma desta casa.
- Tens alma de comerciante.
Yes, and you the soul of a prostitute.
Pathetic.
What a disaster. The horror.
Not give up so easily. </ P>
I'm looking for a new life.
Love the Bugatti. </ P> A valley full of < br /> flowers and happiness.
Do not cut the deck, Isadora. bad luck.
Soul of the universe... flow into me.
Death.
Death always appears in the first letter.
It also means 'harvest'.
The patient-lover.
Let's see tomorrow.
Me leave sated with love.
- Just be open to that.
The second The moon letter....
Death on the moon, what to say, Pim.
Death by water.
A morte sobre a lua, o quê quer dizer, Pim?
Morte por água.
For months, I had misgivings...
Why is ignored.
This morning, when the nurse calmed children...
...not to molest me...
I said 'Let them play.
' What would we do without <br
/ > the sound of their voices? '.
Once a psychic told me...
...would lose what had more expensive in the world.
However, not heard. always had hallucinations, but did not pay attention...
Singer sent me a message that said: 'Come I see, 'and I went.
On the way...
...with children in my arms...
I felt full of hope...
Often, as a enchanted tale, heard a voice.
I thought it was going to see... Singer with children, it would be easier.
There are...
...my poor, fragile...
...and beautiful children.
Singer wanted to talk to me alone, and send the children for a stroll in Paris.
I gave them a kiss.
I kissed the glass instead of kissing her lips.
This contact cold still remains in my lips.
There are pain-killing.
This tragedy...
...ended with no desire to a normal and happy life.
Since then...
...I'm only as a consolation fly...
...fly to escape this horror endless.
My life has just been a series of fights.
In a ghost ship...
...in an ocean phantom.
Moments of my life that I remember with great joy...
...were taught as children.
And it would be well again.
In the spring of 1921,
I received a telegram from the Soviet government...
It was a wonderful simplicity.
'Only the government can understand Russian. point.
' Come with us. Point.
You build a school.'</ P>.
So I left the old world...
...and I was willing to receive the new.
The lights went out.
- Bring lamps.
Isadora, Isadora...
Here Comrade... have a lamp.
Comrades Silence.
Keep on dancing.
I will continue...
...but I want to sing to me. mas quero que cantem para mim.
Russia with great expectations.
I had promised a school...
...with a thousand students.
Because it was a bad time.
They came to me for food and shelter.
Children are homeless and hungry, they said.
'Dance is a luxury.
Give them bread.'
So I made a decision...
...nourish the body and spirit
< br /> these children.
The government could not give us material aid...
...just an old building.
So I said it would take me only fifty children.
It would power more than that.
Here, in a large room...
...failed in a palace, without hot water...
...no beds, no mattresses...
...and the furniture of the former owner were confiscated by the state.
I was opening my new dance school.
It is Mary's calling you.
I thought.
I have the address.
From Mr. Bugatti.
What? </ p > That said.
Bugatti.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
I saw hungry and misery in Moscow...
...but... the life of an artist is different from that of a saint. found different ways to forget.
I made friends among Russian poets , artists, writers...
We'd secretly vodka and champagne.
The idol of this generation...
...was the poet Sergei Yesenin.
Us: Sergei Alexssander...
The first time I heard it, he recited a poem.
He talks about the plains where he was born...
He said that is lost as you, who can not return... dedicated this poem to you, ma'am.
I know...
I know.
I did not know that a poet could be so beautiful...
...as his verses.
Tell him.
What did he say?
What derperdiçou your life.
Love is their only hope.
You're my man gold.
Man Gold.
It is a book.
It's a pencil.
The pencil is red.
This pencil is blue.
No, it's red.
Sergei not speak to that.
As they say: 'I want to make love '.
How do you say 'I love you'.
Very well, write. e...'You have beautiful legs?' </ P> I beg.
Sergei, has wonderful legs.
</ P> Write 'I love you.
You have beautiful thighs.'
As they say:' We love like tigers '.
Answer me.
Answer me.
We love like tigers.
Tigers around the world, unite.
Where were you?
Affection... affection...
Enough.
Enough.
Damn...
Husband?
- No.
It is not my husband.
That man, husband.
Husband.
Farewell, husband.
No, Sergei.
- You're horrible.
Adeus, marido.
Não, Sergei.
- És horrível. will bite it is very strong.
Here's what I do...
Poor old...
Goodbye, young man.
Goodbye everybody.
Goodbye everybody.
We do not need you, Isadora.
Farewell, old life.
Goodbye, children.
No, not them.
No children, no.
Children not.
Have mercy.
Your husband is dead.
His sons are dead.
I'm your husband.
His children, I am.
Isadora, who is this man? Who is he? </ P>
The man who is in the studio. </ P> Oh, it...
Have you seen him?
- Yes.
Oh, ele...
Você o viu?
- Sim.
Eu estou falando de... Bugatti.
No, it was when I arrived. offer 1,200 francs for everything. What do you think? </ P>-I think it's good.
Isadora, what's going on? </ P> I made a decision. </ P> sell everything.
My property, my property, everything.
I'm going to Paris, ask for Elizabeth...
...bring 12 of the best students in the school...
...of Moscow.
We will celebrate recital... and a new school.
Wonderful.
Mary, I'll get back to work to save my life.
Here they are.
What a beautiful couple.
Wow.
What think you have a passport?
American or Russian?
Who knows?
Sorry, can not move from here.
Welcome to America.
Easy. Silence.
Lamento, não podem passar daqui.
Bem-vindos à América.
Calma. Silêncio. ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Yesenin, will speak to everyone.
I bring the greetings of the young the Soviet Union.
During Revolution the United States helped us a lot...
...sending food and blankets.
I'm here to give back.
The soul of America and the soul of Russia...
...should strive to understand.
Miss Duncan, as does to stay so young? </ p >.
I want you to eat and drink, and I am married to a handsome man.
Why so long refused to give them visa.
Some officers think that having a Russian passport...
...makes you a criminal bloodthirsty.
Why became a Russian citizen?
Because I fell in love with a Russian. had the bitter experience of note, to a man and a woman can not sleep together in a hotel...
...if they are not husband and wife.
Have you finished?.
- No, my love, wait...
...finished.
Sergei, did not recite some poems.
Miss Duncan, will give recitals
Russian ballet, and Mr. Yesenin include poems.
It is true that her husband was violent with you on the ship?
There was a party and as every Russian break some objects.
If they had participated, may have done the same.
Describes itself a communist?
Sergei and I are artists, and as we all revolutionary authenticity.
It's not about politics.
I do not believe that revolution is political.
</ P> If people listen to your heart, would listen to him...
...would know how better to live..
I think this would be the real revolution.
Sergusha, will read his poems.
Tell them I'm coming.
Go.
Poems in Russian. Excellent.
Will be a great story. </ P> Tell them
I'm coming. </ P> Day I'm coming.
Go, go. I.
Now, Sergei tell a poem.
It's about the Soviet Union and about America.
Extend hands < br /> as I have done.
Agora, Sergei dirá um poema.
É sobre a União Soviética e sobre a América.
Estendam as mãos assim como eu fiz.
Sr. Yesenin, é um Bolchevique?
- Sou um poeta.
This morning, I bought this Isadora.
North American poetry is.
It's beautiful.
Lindo.
- Are you sure he's okay?
I'll tell you my first poem to America. is shooting.
Quiet. Calm.
It's just a joke.
There are real bullets.
There are real bullets.
A calamity crossed our borders...
...and entered into our land.
A plague in the form of two Bolsheviks, revolutionaries, agitators...
...that should never have come here. have no right to be here.
And here...
...must be expelled in the name of Jesus Christ.
My friends, I say: that will.
What is going to Russia.
Do not come corrupting the soul of our people.
Will I there people also have a soul?
Return to Russia.
Communist red.
This woman, believe which is a dancer.
I saw.
The clothes they wear does not help, or to involve a beggar. </ p >.
We do not want you in Boston.
If you wear pink, speaks as reds and dance like a whore.
We want Boston.
Download the scenario. not want so...
We do not want here.
They are followers of Gorki They stink.
Meu corpo... Meu corpo é lindo.

- Go, do not want you here.
You're dead.
America is dead...

I am a Red but my soul is pure...
...hundred times more pure than his choristers...
...cheap here.
You are dead.
You are gray. This city is gray, this theater is...
...gray.
They are ashes.
Afraid of freedom.
Are you afraid that artists enjoy your freedom.
Return, undead. return.
I wanted to dance for you...
'Deliverance <br / > of the Russian people '.
Because I thought that
America would understand...
...forgot to do their own revolution.
Do we violent? not be tamed.
You're rich, Isadora, rich.
Do not be sad.
Go with you in Paris. We will be together. </ P> I won 800 francs that...
...these people. </ P> The kind who want to help. </ P> What did you do? </ P >.
You betrayed me.
How.
My beautiful curtains.
You sold them.
You told me that wanted to sell them.
He said he wanted...
You know me
15 years ago and I do not understand.
Sells only place I could be happy.
You had decided.
Você me conhece há 15 anos e não me entende.
Vende o único lugar que eu poderia ser feliz.
Você tinha decidido.
But I did not.
There is still time.
Say you changed your mind.
You want to go to Paris and I precipitated.
I was sold for 30 pieces.
Wrong.
If you really loved me you'd understand...
I can not stand like you...

Yes, it is very beautiful.
Archer, dear.

How's that, Kitty?
To your left, George.
That's good, that's good.
Come on, get your back in it.
Come on, stupid!
- Come on!
- What are you doing to Jumbo?
- Work ain't gonna hurt him...
- I told you to leave him alone.
Jumbo is a star, not a laborer.
Come on.
A bull's a bull. The way you spoil this one burns me up.
Oh, really?
Let me tell you.
I don't know the shows you've been with.
But in this show, you're gonna do it our way. He's a star.
- Cool him off, Jumbo.
- Hey, what are you doing?
Put me down, you crazy...! Put me down!
Put me down, you idiot! Put me down!
- Don't you drop me, you big baboon!
- All right.
Hey, don't you drop me...!
Come on, Jumbo. Come on, come on.
- I quit!
- Too late. You're fired.
I hate to let him go. He is a good canvas man. Come on.
Nobody's gonna treat you that way.
Don't you worry, baby.
Never happen again.
Trouble is, he thinks you're an elephant.
Well, that'll give you an idea of his mentality.
Oh, what a nerve! Imagine working a person before breakfast.
As soon as rehearsal's over,
I'll let you hay up.
Well, Beauty, you're almost as pretty as your picture.
You just stay right here in the sunshine and get dry, you hear?
All right, baby?
Come on, Jumbo, rehearsal time.
- Harry, I'm sorry I'm late.
- Morning, Kitty.
Do you have Jumbo's new music?
Oh, good.
Good morning, Jumbo.
And what key would you like it in?
B flat?
Very well. B flat.
- All right.
- Ready?
Very good. Wasn't it, Harry?
Let's try it again, boys, huh?
Excuse me.
I've been looking all over the place for you. Where you been?
All over the place. How about you, Pop?
Oh, I just moseyed into town for a while...
...to take a look around, get the local color.
- You know.
- Yeah, I know.
How you can find a crap game in a strange town before breakfast beats me.
Crap game? Me?
What makes you think that?
Well, for one thing, Eddie told me that the cash box was empty this morning.
How much did you lose?
I'll level with you, Kitten.
I run a hot 300 bucks into a cool 30 cents.
- Oh, Pop.
- Don't worry, honey.
We'll make it back tonight.
We'll be sold out.
What's the good of being sold out, now, Pop?
We owe bills from here to Kansas City and points east.
Do you know how much money we owe right here in this town?
All right. I guess we can stall them again.
We've had enough practice.
That's my Kitten.
Come on, Jumbo! Mush!
All right, boys and girls, get to work.
The boss is here.
Everybody does what they want.
No management.
Come on, Jumbo.
Mary. Come on, get back up there.
What are you, a quitter?
I'll never be able to do it, Kitty.
I've tried and I've tried.
And you'll keep trying and trying and trying.
- Here you are, Leona.
- Thank you, Kitty.
Hey, Kitty! Kitty!
- George! You did it. Oh, I knew you could.
- Thanks, Kitty.
You see what hard work does?
Oh, George.
All right, hold it.
Stop this show!
Hold it!
- Yes?
- Where's Pop Wonder?
Oh, well, Pop's busy right now.
I'm his daughter, Kitty.
- Can I help you?
- Very simply.
- Just cross my palm with $260.
- I'll take 150.
- Make mine 70.
- Would you mind stepping outside, please?
We can talk better out here.
You know how sensitive artists are.
I'm a little sensitive myself, particularly about not being paid...
...for enough chow to feed an army.
- Ten tons of hay.
I've been swindled out of 300 feet of prime lumber.
Gentlemen, please, no one's been swindled.
You mean so far. Well, I'm taking my food back to town right now.
Oh, well, you wouldn't do a thing like that.
No? Just watch me. I've had dealings with you circus people before.
Well, I know you have.
And think of all the nice profits you've made too.
I'll bet you don't get a bunch of suckers like us every day, now do you?
Paying those top prices you charge us.
- I declare.
- So far you haven't paid us anything.
- Oh, but we're going to.
- When?
Tonight. Gentlemen, we'll be sold out.
Every seat.
So if you come back after the performance, you'll all be paid in full.
Well, all right, Miss Wonder.
I'll take your word for it this time.
- It's against my better judgment...
- Thank you very much, sir.
We'll dang well be back tonight.
I know you will.
I'll be looking forward to seeing you.
They gone?
For now, yes. But they'll dang well be back tonight.
You did it, again, Kitten.
I'm proud of you.
I wish I was.
Oh, Pop, how long can we go on like this?
One day, they'll come along and attach every asset we've got.
- Including Jumbo.
- Jumbo? They wouldn't dare.
Why, he's like a son to me.
You can even see the resemblance.
Oh, Pop, let's hope we're still laughing on the way to jail.
See you at the parade.
Go hay up, you beautiful beast.
Hold it.
- We had a dinner date last night.
- I'm sorry, Lu. I got tied up.
Yeah. So did I.
Cooking a 12-course dinner.
I figured around 1 you weren't gonna show up...
...so I ate it myself.
- Gee, Lu, l...
- Yeah, I know, I know.
You ever try eating a 12-course dinner for two?
Not that I mind, no.
It's just that I'm...
I'm a lousy cook.
- You gonna help me with this or ain't you?
- Of course.
Incidentally, you know what today is?
Certainly I know what today is.
It's your birthday.
Happy birthday, Lulu.
"Happy birthday, Lulu." It ain't my birthday. I don't have birthdays.
- It's our 14th anniversary.
- No fooling?
No fooling. Today we've been engaged exactly 14 years.
No. It seems like yesterday.
Not to me, it doesn't.
Lulu, tell you what.
You and I'll have dinner tonight.
We'll celebrate.
And I'll do the cooking.
It'll be just you and me and Jumbo.
I sure wished I knew what was gonna happen.
Kitty?
Coming.
- Yes, Joey?
- Murph and Gogo just quit the show.
We're gonna be short on clowns.
Do you think you can fill in?
- Here we go again. I'll try.
- Good girl.
Anybody home?
Yes?
My name is Sam Rawlins.
I'm looking for a job.
- Oh? Doing what?
- Anything and everything.
- They told me to see you.
- You've been with it before?
- All my life.
- What shows?
You name it, I've worked it.
Here today, gone tomorrow, huh?
Sorry, we're full up.
Not from what I hear.
You must be pretty short-handed when a girl has to double a clown.
Look, would you excuse me, please?
I have a parade in 10 minutes.
Hey, that's quite an improvement.
I could be a big help to you, Miss Wonder.
Take me on for a week.
Lf, at the end of that time, you don't like me, I'm on my way.
I'm sorry, but we don't hire sunshiners.
I'm just a circus bum, huh?
Okay.
Wait a minute. If you're hungry, go by the cookhouse.
- Tell them I said it's all right.
- Thanks.
I'm looking for a job, not a handout.
- Did you hear that applause, Kitten?
- I sure did.
Did you ever think in a few days...
...we'll be miles away, but they'll remember...
...this night at the circus the rest of their lives.
That's kind of a nice thing to be able to do for people.
Yep.
It went great, Al. Why don't you try the traveling triple tomorrow?
I can do better than that.
Tomorrow I'm traveling to Cincinnati.
Cincinnati?
The John Noble show offered me money.
Money. That's all they think about.
Money, money.
He hasn't been paid in two months.
Never mind, let him work for Noble.
Who cares?
I'm almost ready with the cannon act
I been perfecting.
It's going great, Hansel.
I think we could stand another spot in that second half.
What's that supposed to mean?
He says he won't work with a hungry bear.
He did? Why, you can't quit.
- Where's your loyalty?
- Don't get excited.
There's nothing you can do.
If he leaves, he leaves.
Why, if it wasn't for me, you'd be a rug.
- What's going on?
- They're quitting.
- Quitting.
- Quitting?
Oh, Gretel, I'm gonna miss you.
I'd like to know where we're gonna find another bear act in Willow Falls, Iowa.
What a night!
Ladies and gentlemen, the Wonder Circus takes enormous pleasure and pride...
...in presenting to you now, the mightiest monster in the whole world.
Stolen from the Rajah of Rangoon...
...8 thousand pounds of pulchritudinous pachyderm...
...the one and only...
...Jumbo!
Ladies and gentlemen...
...may I have your attention, please.
One of the most spectacular acts ever presented anywhere in the world...
...high over the center ring, walking the high wire...
...with his face completely hooded, with no net beneath him...
...with any misstep a dive to death...
...the great, the incomparable, Mantino!
The great Mantino!
Where is he?
The great Mantino.
- Have you seen him anywhere?
- Not since the parade.
- I bet he's quit too.
- Oh, no.
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...during the next few dangerous minutes,
I ask that each and every one of you...
...be absolutely silent.
The great Mant...
And now, my friends, the Wonder Circus proudly presents...
...the grand finale of the show.
- Hey, Kitty, who's he?
- Who's who?
- The tourist who just walked the high wire.
Don't be silly, Lulu. Mantino.
- And all the other lovable characters out of Mother Goose.
- What were you doing on...?
- What about that job?
Where is Mantino?
Last I saw of the great man, he was hotfooting it to the train.
- Oh, that John Noble show.
- That's right.
What are you doing in his wardrobe?
I convinced him the least he could do was leave his gear behind.
You didn't tell me you were a high-wire man.
I've done the trick on the low.
The only difference is a few feet.
Do you know you could've been killed?
I could also be run over by a beer wagon crossing Main Street.
But I always look both ways.
Don't miss your cue, Miss Wonder.
Just a minute, you.
I don't know who you are, young fella...
...but nobody works this show without the owner's permission.
And from now on, you've got my permission.
Come on, let's talk it over.
What's your name?
- Sam Rawlins.
- The job pays 40 bucks a week, Sam.
Some weeks.
Tina.
Tina, what are you...?
Where are you going?
I wanted to sneak out.
I couldn't bear to say goodbye.
- Oh, Tina.
- It's not my idea, it's Harry's.
Well, I hope Harry has some more ideas.
Like how are we gonna find a trumpet player in Willow Falls, Iowa.
Sorry. I'm not supposed to tell you, but some of the other musicians...
...are walking too. Come on.
Wait a minute. Stay here, please.
I'll have your money in two minutes.
- Listen...
- Please! You'll get every cent, I promise.
- Oh, I could just cry.
- You probably will.
Eddie!
- Oh, hi.
- Get me the cash box, would you?
- We sure had a good night.
- We sure can use it.
- Eight hundred dollars.
- Thanks.
- Pop!
- I tried to talk him out of it.
He said he was gonna win back what he lost to surprise you.
- How much of a head start does he have?
- Not much.
That's enough.
Well, look what the wind blew in.
Interested in a little snooker, honey?
- Where do you hide the crap game?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
There's no crap game here.
Come on, lady luck, for your old buddy Pop.
Let's see that natural.
Thank you.
- Here goes. Double or nothing.
- Nothing!
- Kitten.
- Nothing, Pop.
I happened to be strolling through town when I ran into a brother Elk.
So I see.
Well, the game is over, Pop.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
I'm sorry too, but that's not your father's.
That's his stake.
Fifty! That's all you have left?
That's the situation that prevails.
Oh, Pop.
Pop. I came to tell you to get back to the lot. There's trouble.
- What trouble? What's the matter?
- Jumbo's sick.
- Jumbo! I can't leave you in no pool hall.
- It's all right, Pop.
Mr. Rawlins will see me safely home.
Now, be careful.
- You permit ladies to play?
- Your money's good.
- Roll for the 50.
- Hold it. Why don't you go home?
Because I...
- I wanna win back some of that money.
- You've got 50. Hang on to it.
Fifty dollars is about as much use to me as three cigar-store coupons.
You know what you're doing?
While other little girls were dressing dolls,
I was rolling fours the hard way.
Now give me those dice.
All right.
Place your bets, men.
- Right there
- There's 20.
Easy money.
- Come on.
- Rub off snake eyes, boxcars, trey.
Rub on sevens any day.
- Hey, she did it.
- Beginner's luck.
- Never do it again.
- Shoot the 100.
- I got 50 of it.
- I'll take 10.
- Forty.
- All down? All down?
Four and a three or a five and a two, even a six and one will do.
- It did!
- Oh, no.
Is that fortunate?
I wouldn't say that.
- Shoot the 200.
- I'll take part.
- All right.
- There's 10 right there.
- Sixty dollars says she can't.
- You seem to be the big winner.
- Don't you feel like covering the rest?
- The lady asked a question. Be polite.
- Paid it.
- Thank you.
All good children go to heaven, all good dice will roll a seven.
- Not a seven, just an eleven.
- Four in a row.
- Told you not to let her...
- Gentlemen.
I'll give you all a chance to recoup.
- Shoot the 400.
- No, I gotta get...
Now, just a minute.
In nice games, nobody walks out a winner unless the loser quits.
And this is a nice game, isn't it?
Or it was until now.
Get it up, boys.
I said, get it up!
That's 15.
There's 155.
- That's the rest of it.
- Shoot, Miss Wonder.
Dice, I need $800 and I need it bad.
Come on, dice, once more.
Once more. All the way.
- You forgot the rhyme!
- Read them and weep!
Let's get out of here.
Eighty, 90, 800.
I wanna thank you for your help too.
With my luck, I ought to give up the circus and hang around poolrooms.
Yeah. I'd keep these with me, though, if I were you.
- Why?
- Sort of special.
- How special?
- They're loaded.
- Loaded?
- You've been playing with loaded dice.
- What?
- That's all right. So was your father.
They rang a pair of cheaters on him the second roll.
I was trying to figure a way to ring in mine, when you solved the problem.
Well...
- You mean when you gave me those dice...?
- I switched in the specials.
I thought they did pretty good.
- You've got a touch of larceny in you.
- A little.
Old magician friend of mine gave me these on my 9th birthday.
"Boy," he said, "don't use them unless the other fellow draws first."
So tonight was one of those nights.
Wait a minute.
You bet against those dice.
I thought it might look a little better.
- How much did you lose?
- Thirty-five dollars.
I'll take care of that right now.
Oh, dear.
There you are. Thank you.
And I do mean thank you.
Twenty, 40, 60. Right, Harry?
Six weeks' salary.
- Please, don't say anything to anybody.
- Money! Money! Payday!
Money. Hey, come on,
I haven't been paid for seven weeks.
And they took every dime of it too.
Of course, everybody's paid off now, but we can't expect miracles every night.
She means you, Diamond Jim.
Kitten, I swear it'll never happen again.
If I ever go near that little ticket wagon, so help me...
...I'll have myself arrested for petty arsony.
- Well, we'll talk about that later.
Right now, we have to come up with acts for Chatsburg.
- Alonzo ain't gonna be easy to replace.
- He sure isn't.
Say, what about Borzoni?
- He does a pretty good turn.
- Borzoni's with John Noble.
Signed up last week.
- How do you know that?
- I'm a scholar. I read Billboard.
John Noble. That name, why, it sticks me like a crow in the throat.
Hiring away my talent.
Stealing acts out from under my very nose.
And why should he do that, Mr. Wonder?
- Because he wants Jumbo.
- Oh, now, Pop.
But he'll never get him.
I haven't got my crystal ball with me, but I think we're going on a long voyage.
- The creditors!
- I forgot about them.
Just tell them I was mauled by a wild camel.
Well, here we go again.
Good luck, Kitten.
Evening, Miss Wonder.
I suppose you know why we're here.
I have the most wonderful news.
We're gonna need triple the supplies we ordered.
- That so?
- We have to stay extra days...
...by popular demand.
- Our money?
- We'll need 50 tons of hay.
- Our money?
- Food for these people.
- Do you have our money?
- Well, not just this minute. But tomorrow...
- Marshal!
Marshal? Oh, marshal.
- You'd better tell her.
- I have a writ here against the circus.
A writ?
Gentlemen, I'm just a woman.
I don't know anything about these things.
What does that mean?
Means you're out of business till we get paid.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
Oh, gentlemen, you can't do this to us.
You can't put all these dear people out of work.
Why, the circus is their whole life.
And think what it is they're doing.
They're bringing joy and laughter to little children.
Shouldn't your band play
"Hearts and Flowers"?
All right, so you hate kids.
But the law is the law and you can't touch us.
Under the State Penal Code, Section 372, and I quote...
You can quote the law to Judge Ellis.
He's my brother.
Help! Mad elephant! Mad elephant!
Run for your lives! Help!
Lulu, what happened?
Call out the militia! Call out the militia!
- Pop?
- Jumbo. He's on a rampage again.
- What?
- Mad elephant. Take to the wagons.
- There's no mad elephant.
- Ask the three he trampled to death.
- Get me the elephant gun.
- You can't kill Jumbo.
- It's him or us!
- Mister, I'm a little too...
We did it. All right, Jumbo, start cleaning up.
You naughty boy,
I'm gonna give you a kiss.
Good Jumbo. Harry, flag's down.
Start loading.
Flag's down. Start loading.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
Relax, they won't find us this soon.
Certainly not.
Besides, we're gonna pay them, ain't we?
- When?
- We'll discuss that at intervals.
Anyway, my intentions are honorable.
- They always are, Pop.
- Yeah.
Say, who are you knitting that for?
Me or Jumbo?
Lu, do you want another doughnut?
Well, I don't wanna see them go to waste.
Say, Pop. What about this Sam Rawlins?
I like him. No, thanks.
He's a very nice, talented young man.
Don't you think it's kind of funny that he just popped up out of nowhere?
Why?
You know darn well he could get twice what we pay.
- Yeah. If we pay him.
- Yeah.
What's funny about it?
He's circus, like us.
Why, we'd die if we weren't with it.
Same with him.
Maybe so.
I must admit, he's not the usual sunshiner.
No, he isn't, dear.
Say, what have you got against sunshiners?
Why, I was a circus bum myself once.
And that'll be just about enough out of you.
- Can I see you a minute, Pop?
- Sure.
Yeah, we were just talking about you.
Kitty was saying that we have...
- Would you like some coffee and doughnuts?
- Nothing, thanks.
If you're worried about anyone following, there's a side road a mile ahead.
It's a few hours longer, but it might be safer.
My boy, that's a masterpiece of strategy, and we thank you for the suggestion.
Right, Kitten?
Right.
Wanna tell Whitey about the turnoff?
Yeah. And I wanna talk to you about an act.
It's about shooting a guy out of a cannon.
It'll be the biggest thing in show business.
- What were you two looking at?
- Your palm.
- You embarrassed me.
- Let me see your palm.
That's for suckers.
Well, you know what Barnum always said:
"There's one born every second."
- Hey, you know what?
- No. And don't tell me, I don't wanna know.
It's witchcraft. Any intelligent person...
- "Wow" what?
- "Wow" wow.
- You really see something?
- Yeah.
I see a man. He's tall, dark...
...and handsome.
- And handsome.
You are such a faker.
Did you ever see anyone short, fat and ugly?
Yep. In the mirror.
I don't have to read your palm, it's written all over your face.
- What's written all over?
- He's a good-looking guy, don't you think?
- Yes.
- See, see?
He's young, healthy and smart.
- You know something else?
- No, what?
He likes you too.
- Oh, Lulu. For heaven's sake.
- But he does too like...
Kitten, don't you ever think of getting married?
Not more than three or four times a day.
With me, it's on the hour.
You know, Lu, I figured it out.
The trouble with us is, we move too fast. We do.
Before we can find out the color of a man's eyes, we're in the next town.
Well, that may be all right with you, but don't forget I'm no spring chicken.
Oh, fiddle. You're not old.
Yeah, I know.
As a matter of fact, the day before yesterday...
...I had a growing pain. It went sideways.
Oh, gosh.
Well, Sam, how are things with you?
- Pretty good.
- And with the Wonder Circus?
Perfect.
Every night when we pull up stakes,
I stick around and pay off the creditors.
They sign the receipts and credit the payment to you.
Good, good.
- There you are, Richards. All paid.
- They don't care as long as they get money.
In three or four weeks, we'll successfully have stolen the Wonder show.
- Stolen?
- Excuse me.
Absorbed.
Sam, what's it like over there?
What do you do, really?
Little of everything. Repair rigging, collect tickets, take a few leaps.
- I also double as the Great Mantino.
- On the high wire?
You haven't worked it for years.
You do use a net, of course?
A net's no use unless you fall.
I don't intend to fall.
I didn't send you there to break your neck.
From now on, you use a net...
...or give up the turn. Understand?
Suppose I don't? What'll you do?
Send me to bed without my supper?
Sam, there's something about your attitude.
Something that puzzles me.
What is it?
Well, I'll tell you, Dad.
- I don't like the way you call me "Dad."
- All right, I'll call you "Father."
That's better.
Go on.
I don't like what I'm doing.
All we want is Jumbo, why ruin a whole circus?
I tried to buy Jumbo. You know that.
They won't sell.
Pop Wonder is a sentimental old fool.
That doesn't make it any easier for me.
I never made things easy for you, Sam.
I brought you up in the roughest, toughest way I could think of...
...and when you could stand on your feet,
I threw you to the wolves.
Why? So when the time came, you'd have the strength...
...to do the things required of you.
- Meaning to do what you want.
- Meaning to carry on where I leave off.
We're building something here.
The greatest show on the face of the earth.
- I wonder about that.
- What?
What is this big drive of yours?
"The greatest show on the face of the earth." Why?
Why does it have to be?
I don't know, Sam. Maybe because
I wanna bring something to people.
More than just a show. A spectacle.
No, more than that.
A miracle.
One miraculous, shining hour, that they couldn't forget if they tried.
You know, it's funny...
...you and Pop Wonder, you both want the same thing.
You just go about it differently.
I've gotta get my train.
Better take some more money.
Sam...
...you're not going to let me down.
I guess not.
Cash on the line, that's my motto.
- When Old Man Wonder says...
- Sign that.
Yes, sir. When Old Man Wonder says
I'll pay you tomorrow...
...I says tomorrow, this stuff is gonna be back under the shed.
- Sam!
- That's what I said.
Dave, you can unload now.
How did you manage that?
- Pop said he wouldn't leave the supplies.
- Passes to the show plus a little charm.
- You must have a pretty good line of talk.
- Yeah, I'm a conversational wizard.
- Morning, Sam.
- Morning.
What's the matter with him?
I don't know.
Every time I try to speak to him lately, he runs out on me.
Yeah? Maybe he's just playing hard to get.
Who wants him?
You do.
- I think he knows it too.
- Well, I'm certainly not going to chase him.
Why not?
What do you think I am, Lulu?
A red-blooded American girl.
Now, go get him.
Well, go on.
Happy hunting.
I'm not hunting.
I'm just stalking him a little.
Need any help?
Need any help?
We could use a good rigger.
We had one. He quit in Kansas City to join the John Noble show.
- I'd better check the traps.
- Next season we're gonna have...
As I was saying, next year we're going to have all new equipment.
- New canvas, new rigging, costumes...
- Where did you learn to fly?
My mother taught me.
Pop says everything new, down to the horses on the carousel.
- How old is that dream?
- A few years.
I thought so.
Where would you be without dreams?
- You just wait and see.
- Don't count on me.
I may not be around to drink in all this beauty.
- Are you going to leave?
- I'm a sunshiner, remember?
- I like to keep on the move.
- Well, people do change, you know.
- People do change.
- Yeah.
Did you get a better offer?
The Noble show, maybe?
Well, I'm gonna tell you something.
You'll hate them.
- Wanna know what's wrong with them?
- No, tell me.
- They're only in it for the money.
- Yeah.
- I can't say the same for the Wonder Circus.
- That's right.
The way you run this outfit is an invitation for someone to walk in and take over.
Looks pretty good, huh?
You have a very successful love life.
- I see a proposal soon.
- Hiya, chief.
He's mad about you.
- Oh, you lucky, girl, you.
- Who?
Look at that love line.
Dirt. Morning, Anthony.
I knew I couldn't be that lucky.
You're luckier than you think.
I got something for you, poopsie.
- It wouldn't be a wedding ring?
- Wedding ring?
Lulu, I'm gonna give you the world.
Come on.
Thanks. I'd rather have a ring.
For years you've been asking for an act under the big top, right?
- Yeah.
- Well, you got it.
- You wouldn't fool me, would you?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You mean, an act of my own?
- Yeah, yeah.
Oh, Anthony, I'm so excited.
Well, what do I do?
Bye!
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing yet, and that's the way I like it.
Are you out of your mind?
I'm offering you a chance of a lifetime.
The golden opportunity to be shot out of a cannon.
Where's your gratitude?
Where my heart is. In my throat.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Forget it.
I guess you just ain't circus, Lulu.
No sawdust in your veins.
I'll perform the trick myself.
Give me that.
Don't tell me I ain't circus.
I'm just as full of sawdust as anybody.
And nobody's gonna do my trick except me.
Even if it is only once.
- Good girl.
- Good girl.
Oh, Anthony, are you sure it's safe?
Would I do anything to hurt you?
I'm gonna make you a star.
A shooting star.
How high do I go?
Thirty-four feet,
10 and three-quarter inches.
I figured it out mathematically.
- And where do I land?
- Right over there.
- Yeah. Right over...
- Like a babe in a downy crib.
Boys, move that crib three feet back!
What goes up, must come down.
You sure you're right about your arithmetic?
- What marks did you get in school?
- Will you please stop worrying? Please?
This is scientific.
A smidgen to the left, boys.
- Put yourself in my hands.
- Okay, Anthony. Anything you say, dear.
That's it. No, no.
You gotta get in backwards.
- Backwards!
- Yes. This is scientific.
This is gonna be great for you.
- Really great.
- Yeah, okay, okay.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Good luck, Anthony.
Thank you.
Hey. What am I doing in a cannon?
Don't lose faith, Lulu.
Think of your name in lights.
- What happened to my lifeline?
- It's just stuck.
Don't breathe.
A snip to the right.
No, I mean the left.
Now, this may mean the difference of success and calamity.
Ready out there, boys?
Here comes Lulu.
Lulu, Lulu, you're going on a trip.
Anthony, dear.
I've changed my mind.
Help.
Lulu?
I disintegrated her.
Lulu, speak to me.
I can't figure out what went wrong.
Maybe I didn't use enough gunpowder.
She had enough in her hair to hold her own Fourth of July.
And next time you try it, use a dummy.
He already did.
I apologized, didn't I?
What more can I do?
- Pop?
- Come in, Sam, but don't light any matches.
I heard you shot Lulu out of a cannon.
That's a lie. Due to a small miscalculation, she slid out backwards.
- You all right, Lulu?
- She's as sound as a bell. Tell him.
Ding-dong.
What did I tell you?
You know better than to fool with gunpowder.
You could've blown her out of the big top.
Don't try that again.
- All right, all right.
- Yeah, and it's all right with me too.
There's enough trouble without looking for it.
We've got a busted generator...
...a torn main top and a lion with a toothache.
A perfectly normal day.
- I like that boy.
- I saw him first.
There you are.
Completely non-inflammable.
- Okay. Thanks, Kitten.
- Pop?
The toot box on the carousel won't play a note.
- Hear that, Kitten?
- I heard it.
- Perfectly normal day.
- You know what I think, Lu?
Whatever it is, no.
I can't see anything wrong.
You can't see nothing because you ain't no toot-box expert.
- And neither am I.
- Well...
I think you better go get Sam.
Maybe he could...
- Hi, Sam.
- Watch it.
- Think you could fix this thing?
- Well, I can try.
You're very chipper this morning,
Mr. Rawlins.
Any special reason?
Or are you just tired of being a grouch?
I feel okay.
- What's that you're whistling?
- A song.
- Well, I thought it might be. What song?
- "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World."
Sam?
Sam?
I'm going into town, and I thought maybe...
- It's a beautiful day and l...
- I can't. I'm working.
Hand me that screwdriver, will you?
Here. Here.
- Here.
- Thanks.
You better take an umbrella.
It might rain.
And there I was, covered with mud, and all he did was laugh.
- You don't have to be so sore about it.
- I'm sore at myself.
- Did you ever throw yourself at a man?
- Yeah.
Lots of times.
And, boy, was my aim bad.
Everybody stay in your seats!
Hold it!
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everybody stay in your seats!
Help us, please.
Come on, I need some help.
Hurry up. Come on.
Get them down! Get them down!
- Come on, come on! Get them down!
- They won't unfold!
Get the catch net, quick.
Hold on. Hold on.
- Get us down!
- We can't. The ropes are fouled.
We're getting a catch net.
All right, come on, guys, get it in here.
Get it in here.
Okay, fellas, come on.
Straighten it out.
All right, girls, you'll have to jump, one at a time.
I'm all right. Get the others first.
Joan. Come on.
All right, Joan. All right.
All right, Mary.
Mary.
- All right, Lulu.
- Here I come!
- The net's broken.
- The net's busted.
That's all right, Lulu.
- What happened?
- Easy now. Slide out.
- Here, now, all right.
- Lift it up, fellas.
Easy, boys. Easy.
- You all right, Lulu?
- Yeah.
- Are you all right, Bud?
- We got trouble here.
Hold on, I'm coming up.
Can you make it?
I can't reach. You'll have to jump.
Take it easy.
Next time.
Now!
Good girl. Throw up a rope!
- Get her to her tent.
- You all right?
- To her wagon.
- Sam, we're in trouble over here!
Sam! Come on!
- You all right, Pop?
- Do I look all right?
What a way to end a brilliant career.
- Where's the big crane?
- Busted.
- Don't worry, Pop, we'll get you out.
- Everything's busted.
Don't pull so hard, it hurts.
- Where is he? Let me through.
- Get this pole off of me.
Let me through. Oh, Anthony. Anthony.
Don't cry, honey.
My number had to come up sometime.
You can't die. You just can't die.
- Lu?
- What?
Will you see that they bury me in full clown makeup?
- With a big smile painted on my face?
- Oh, Anthony. I love you, Anthony.
- There, there.
- I love you.
I love you too, Lulu.
You know my one regret?
- What? What?
- That we never got married.
Honestly?
And, you know, if I had it to do all over again...
...we'd get married tomorrow.
- Come on, boys. Get it up.
- Oh, Anthony.
- Get it up.
That's the most beautiful proposal a girl ever had.
- Pick it up. Pick it up. Steady. Steady.
- Please, Anthony.
Steady.
- Let me down. Let me down from here.
- You all right, Pop?
Not a scratch. I was just a little numb.
- My husband!
- Particularly in the head.
I talked in my delirium.
- And we're gonna get married tomorrow.
- That's right.
And all it took was a small hurricane.
Everything is gonna be all right.
Yes, darling.
Come on, give me a hand with this canvas.
Oh, Sam, I was scared.
For the first time in my life,
I was really scared.
For the first time in my life, so was I.
I thought I was going to lose you, Kitty.
Oh, Sam.
- We have so much to talk about.
- Some of it will have to wait, I'm afraid.
I'm catching the 2:00 train out of here.
It's not what you think.
There's something...
Some business I have to clear up.
I'll be back tomorrow, I promise.
- You trust me, don't you?
- Oh, yes, I do.
And, Sam,
I want you to know something.
I'll never be any trouble to you, or tie you down.
You can go where you want, and when you want.
I wouldn't mind at all being a sunshiner's wife.
That sounds very much like a proposal,
Miss Wonder.
I guess I meant it that way.
If you don't mind, I'm sort of old-fashioned.
I'll do the proposing, all right?
- All right.
- Kitty...
- Yes, Sam.
...will you marry me?
What's the matter with you pushers?
You gotta drop everything you pick up?
I always figured when I got around to this,
I'd pick a nice romantic setting.
Moonlit night, soft summer breeze, and somewhere a night bird chirping.
Get a look at this.
Bridge washed out below the junction, mister.
Won't be a train out of here before tonight.
Thank you.
To tell you the honest truth, I don't know whether this will fly 100 miles.
- Why don't you walk? It'd be a lot safer.
- Because I'm crazy. Let's go.
It's your neck.
Contact!
Richards, where's my father?
Why are you here?
Anything wrong?
Everything's wrong. The whole deal is off.
Now, where is he?
- In Vinedale, taking over the Wonder Circus.
- Taking over...?
Where's Lulu?
- Pop, she'll be here.
- Is the minister here?
- You spoke with him. He's right there.
- What'd I say?
You sure I'm supposed to look like this?
- You look beautiful.
- I feel like an undertaker at my own funeral.
- Where's Sam? I don't see Sam.
- Sam will be here. Don't worry.
I suppose you and him will be doing this pretty soon, huh?
- You'll have to ask Sam about that.
- Just don't be nervous about it, that's all.
Look at the time already.
Half past something.
- You don't think Lulu's...?
- Here she comes.
Well, look at that.
- Look at that girl. A vision!
- Isn't she pretty?
And all this time, I thought she looked like George Washington.
Hey, put that back.
What do you think you're...?
- What are you doing to my circus?
- Nothing. I'm taking down my circus.
What kind of a joke is this?
Mr. Wonder, I have here $30,000 worth of bills against the Wonder Circus.
- What?
- You can't have it. We don't owe a cent.
- Where did you get these?
- That is not the point.
They've been signed over to John Noble Enterprises for collection.
- I'm collecting.
- This is the foreclosure notice.
- You can't do this.
- But you can't take my circus away.
I'm Pop Wonder.
Where's Sam?
- Sam?
- Sam?
- Yes, yes. He ought to be here.
- What would he have to do with you?
Well, he's my son.
I'm sorry it had to be done this way...
...but would you like me to make the announcement to your crew?
No. No, I'll make it myself.
Tell them they'll all have jobs with my show.
And that goes for you too, Mr. Wonder.
Yeah.
It's not so bad for me, all I lost was a circus.
But you, Kitten, how could he do this to you?
It was easy. She was in love with him.
- Pop, what's going on?
- Pop?
- Listen. Listen.
- Quiet, everybody. Quiet.
The groom's gonna make a speech.
I got some real good news for you.
You know we've had a little trouble making ends meet.
Sometimes they meet in the middle, sometimes they don't meet at all.
Well, today, through a stroke of business genius, I got...
I got John Noble to buy out the Pop Wonder Circus.
Wait a minute.
He's got jobs for all of you.
- What about you, Pop?
- Me?
I'm taking my share and settling down on a little farm I got my eagle eye on.
Besides, I'm getting sort of old to be a clown.
I don't feel so funny anymore.
Pop, you got a minute?
How about Jumbo?
Does he go along with this deal?
Jumbo. Why, that poor pachyderm would die without me.
I gotta get him out of here. Fast.
But even if you do, where you gonna hide him?
Hide him?
I got a friend in Detroit with a basement.
Easy now, old boy.
Just make yourself inconspicuous-like.
Just walk natural, as if you were out for a stroll. Not a word.
- Not a word.
- Hold it!
Hold it right there!
Where are you going with that elephant?
What elephant?
- Come on, men.
- Come on, Jumbo.
Yes, sir, mister. Someday people are gonna be flying all over in these things.
Clear across the continent, clear across the world.
Someday.
But not tonight.
- All right, Jumbo.
- Let's go, Jumbo.
Jumbo, hey.
Come on, Jumbo, get up in there.
Oh, no, no, no!
No, no...
It's all right, Jumb.
Everything's gonna be fine.
You just have to do what they tell you, that's all.
And then you won't get hurt.
We don't want you to get hurt, baby.
Are you gonna be a good boy?
I love you, Jumb.
I love you.
And I'm gonna miss you, Jumb.
Now, come on. Now, be a big boy...
...and get in there.
Now, come on, Jumbo.
Don't you touch him.
Good morning, Mr. Bones.
Good morning, Mr. Tambo.
Look at that lovely sun.
- Isn't it a scrumptious day for starving?
- Indubitably. But I got a problem.
- And what's that?
- I hate to starve on an empty stomach.
You know, we gotta earn some money, Mr. Bones.
And how do we do that?
- Well, if I had some ham I'd play Hamlet.
- Lf I had some eggs I'd join you.
That's a knee-slapper.
And you know something?
If we had a tree we could have a trio.
Yeah. Yeah. But where can we find a tree?
You idiots.
Kitty.
- Wait a minute!
- Take your hands off me!
- Listen! Please listen!
- I listened to you once...
...and you stole a circus.
Did you forget something?
- I want to explain!
- Let go of me!
Put them up!
Pop, stop it. Stop it, Pop.
He's not worth it.
Don't hit him, Anthony.
Let me hit him.
Lu!
Now why don't you get out of here and go back to your father?
I left my father.
I know how you feel.
There isn't anything you can say to me I haven't said to myself.
Please. I want to come back.
I need you.
I need all of you.
From the looks of things around here, you need me.
You call this two-bit carnival a circus?
This isn't even a broken-down sideshow.
Jumbo!
It is written.
"Go out into the world
And proclaim the good news to all creation."
Let us pray now for three members of our Order... who leave us this day to carry on our work beyond these walls.
We ask you, oh Lord, to watch over Sister Michelle... and those two of Your servants whom she has chosen to accompany her.
- We ask you to guard over Sister Barbara.
- Thank you.
Look with favor, too, upon Sister Irene.
May You bless their efforts and grant them the strength and patience...
To carry out Your will.
And may they find, through Your divine mission and sacrifice.
A continuing source of dedication... and inspiration.

We're gonna live the way other people live and dress the way they do.
For once in our religious lives, we're not going to be different.
There's a lot to be said for being different.
Don't you see, we can't be identified with the old Order.
If we're gonna reach these people, we've got be accepted first as women... then as nuns.
Yeah, well, I think we're about to be accepted as women.

The door's open, ladies.
- It's...
- Will you hold this, please?
You just got to know the combination, that's all.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir. You've been very helpful.
But I think we can manage now.
- I'm sorry, but the office is closed.
- But we have to see the doctor.
Hey, Doc? Doc? You left us hangin' in the middle of our thing, man.
Fake it for about 32 bars,
I'll be right back.
Okay.
You're the doctor?
- You don't look like a doctor.
- Well... man doesn't live by bread alone, especially the kind of bread you make in a free clinic.
John Carpenter, M.D.
Just like the sign says.
- Which one of you is in trouble?
- I beg your pardon?
Look, I know the whole story.
You don't want to go to your family doctor uptown... so you figure you'll come here and get everything straightened out, right?
We were sent here.
You came to the wrong place.
I won't do any more for you than I would any other kid who finds herself in the same fix.
Whichever one of you is the lucky girl, follow me.
I'll give you some vitamin pills and a diet sheet.
Just try not to gain too much weight, especially in the first three months.
All three of you?
Uh, just out of curiosity, was it the same guy?
Doctor, we were sent here by the Catholic Action Committee.
Don't try to con me, honey.
We were given to understand...
That you were desperately in need of nurses.
That's my problem.
It's got nothing to do with you chicks.
We are the nurses they sent.
I am a psychiatric social worker with a degree in speech therapy.
Sis... Barbara is a laboratory technician.
Irene is a R.N.
With a degree in public health.
Great. Just great.
I ask for three hard-nosed nurses and they send me Park Avenue debutantes.
Which end of Park Avenue do you figure I'm from, Doctor?
The last three nurses who worked here couldn't take it.
Two of them got raped.
- One even against her will.
- We are very hard-nosed.
Cute.
But not hard enough.
You'll never make it in this neighborhood, ladies. Never.
Well, Doctor, you don't exactly sound as if you were born and bred here.
- I'm from Tennessee.
- Obviously not on a diplomatic mission.
Honey, diplomacy starts and ends here at the point of a switchblade.
- Why don't you go back uptown?
- We are here and we are going to stay here for two months... which is the length of our assignment.
Okay. Okay.
- Have you got a place to stay?
- We understand Father Gibbons... the local parish... has arranged for an apartment.
Okay. We start work at 8:00 sharp.
See you then, all right?
All right.
Oh, ladies, what are your names?
Oh, I'm Michelle.
This is Irene and Barbara.
Last names?
Oh.
- You do have last names, don't you?
- Oh, yes.
- It's Gallagher.
- Gallagher.
Nice Irish boy meets pretty French girl and what happens happens, huh?
Yeah. Barbara?
Bennett.
Irene?
Hawkins.
Okay, ladies, that will be all.
See you tomorrow morning.
Good-bye.
Weirdos, man. Weirdos.
- Just get out of our way.
- Washington Street is our turf, see?
We have no designs on anything on Washington Street.
Now, if you'll excuse us.
Saints preserve us, it's a rumble.
There we are.
You get out of here, all of ya!
I'll call the precinct.
Good afternoon.
Talk about the wages of sin.
Will you look at the duds on them.
Oh, we're not what you think we are.
Sure, and they're calling themselves "massosies" now.
I read it in the Enquirer:
We don't want any monkey business around here,
I'm warning ya.
- We have friends at the precinct.
- We want to be friends too.
Call Father Gibbons.
He'll want to know what's coming into his parish now.
And tell him one of'em's black as the ace of spades.
Ooh-ooh!
I think our neighbors are Catholic.
Yes. It's too bad they're not Christian.
- What a mess.
- What a rotten mess.
Well, furniture would help.
We'll check that out with Father Gibbons when we go to evening prayers.
In the meantime, let's get this place next to godliness.
It's only 7:00.
This church keeps banker's hours.
All right.
All right, I'm coming.
I'm coming!
You don't have to knock the door down.
Father Gibbons?
Come in.
Come in.
Well, what is it?
An accident?
I don't fancy giving a conditional absolution on a long ride in an ambulance...
And having to pay my own way back from the hospital in a taxi.
It's nothing like that, Father.
What then?
- We wanted to come into the church to pray.
- Oh.
So it's you?
The secret agents from the Little Sisters of Mary.
Well, uh, in a manner of speaking, yes.
You might say we're on a secret mission.
I don't like underground nuns who wear bobbed hair and silk stockings.
Oh, but they're nylon, Father.
Thank you.
Father, we're here to help.
For 43 years,
I've managed without you.
The bishop told me to let you come into the parish and find a place for you to live.
And don't expect anything else from me.
Well, we'd like to pray.
Very well.
I keep the doors locked.
I'm not about to roll aut the red carpet... for every thief in the neighborhood to come in and steal our candlesticks... and anything else you can't nail down.
They've already made off with one of the Stations of the Cross.
Now, when you've finished, you'll find your own way out.
Thank you, Father.
- Father Gibbons?
May I suggest you put away the candlesticks... unlock the doors and make it easier for those who wish to pray to our Lord?
Flapper skirts on a bride of Christ.
I've been ordered by the bishop to countenance.
But I warn you, Sister,
I'll have none of your arrogant lip.
You think it's twins?
I think it's the Green Bay Packers, that's what I think it is.
Good morning.
Oh, good morning, ladies.
Back this way, please.
Where's Miss Teenage America?
She gone back to mother already?
The Catholic Action Committee is sending us some secondhand furniture.
Barbara's gone to wait for it.
She'll be here just as soon as she can.
- It'll be a relief to sleep in a bed again.
- Hmm?
Yeah. You'll take care of the house calls.
- You'll work with me here in the office all right?
- Yes, Doctor.
Now, about the house calls...
- You probably won't be able to make 'em all in one day.
- I'll make them.
I've shorted you on drugs.
I don't want you getting rolled for narcotics.
Doctor, I was born in a place like this.
I know where it's at.
Fine. Just don't push your luck, huh?
I got a patient for you.
What's she doing here?
She sure doesn't act like she enjoys it.
She knows it's her duty.
Forcing yourself to like misery?
That's her bag, huh?
A girl like that should get married and raise a whole bunch of kids.
Turn her hang-ups into something worthwhile.
In fact, uh, I'd prescribe that for all three of you.
You said you had a patient.
In my office.
Don't you run off.
I'll be right with you.
Mr. Hernandez, Julio, this is Miss Gallagher.
How do you do?
Hello.
Stand up.
Miss Gallagher's a speech therapist.
I want her to talk to Julio.
What good is to talk?
He no talk back.
- Julio.
- What's the matter with you?
He's got trouble, miss.
Trouble in school, trouble on the streets... all because he don't talk good.
Do they have a remedial speech program at the school?
What school?
He comes from the school with the high wall...
- bars on the window, that kind of school.
- I n-n-no g-g-go back.
You shut up!
You don't talk until you talk good.
- You just listen!
- Julio.
Maybe I can help you.
Maybe we can correct your speech problem.
W-W-Why... do I... do-do it?
T-T-Tell me.
He talk like a dummy, but he ain't no dummy.
Mr. Hernandez, we're not gonna get anyplace...
Until you let Julio speak for himself.
Julio.
- That's sharp.
- It feels... good.
I feel good.
I... talk... better.
Julio, put it down.
You heard the lady.
Drop it or I'll smash your teeth in.
Julio, please,
For me.
You see, he knows what's good for him.
Julio, I'd like to see you tomorrow afternoon at 4:00.
All right?
Al-All... r-r-right.
- I'll bring him.
- Alone, doctor Carpenter.
Alone, Mr. Hernandez.
Gracias.
It gets a little messy down here.
I thought you handled that very well, Miss Gallagher.
Well, you certainly have a way with a compliment, doctor.
It's Southern charm, we call it.
He seems to be taking it very well.
Yeah. Well, you don't feel very much when you're on the stuff.
- "H."
- Oh.
- Hello?
- Hi. Listen, the furniture came... but the men just dumped it on the sidewalk... and drove off before
I could stop them.
Just a minute.
It's Barbara.
The furniture arrived and she needs some help getting it into the apartment.
Look, I got patients stacked up out there like jet planes over International Airport.
So I can tell Barbara what to do with her furniture.
Dr. Carpenter suggests that you rely on your own resources to solve this problem.
Ay, mama!
Lily.
The hussy.
Massosie.
I have to get this furniture moved downstairs...
And I need a man.
Oh, good.
All I have is 40 dollars. But I'll get more.
I'll get the other 20.
Now, you borrowed 50, you owe 60, you pay back 40.
Now you owe 30.
I'll pay it back.
Friday, for sure.
I'm not worried. I got good collateral... your arms, your legs... your wife and your kids.
It's very heavy.
You think we're some kind of faggots?
I beg your pardon?
Everybody says it's how she was born deaf.
Well, there's no sign of any physical damage.
She doesn't respond.
Has she ever tried to speak?
- I heard her whistle once.
- People learn to whistle by imitating the sound.
- But you got to be able to hear to do that.
- Maybe she can hear.
- Is Amanda your daughter?
- My sister's kid.
She just come and dumped her on me a couple of years ago.
She-She never wanted the kid in the first place.
- I think she's autistic.
- Artistic?
Nah. She don't even lift up a crayon.
No. Autistic.
Sometimes, when a child's rejected very early in life... they crawl inside themselves and shut out the whole world... as if they're trying to punish the rest of us along with themselves.
Amanda?
Hey. Hey.
Hey, baby, look at me.
Come on, come on, look at me.
You see how she resists any kind of contact.
It's typical of autistic frustration.
Well, she never likes anyone to pick her up or hold her.
First, I want to make sure she's not deaf.
- I think she ought to see a specialist.
- You're the doctor.
- Hey, we got it all moved in, chula.
- I don't know how to thank you.
Sure you do.
Hey, we're gonna have a party, huh?
Hey, Tito!
- No, gentlemen, really. I have work to do.
- Hey, you got some wine?
And I will get the first dance.
- No, no. I am the first.
- Oh, no, gentlemen.
- I really think you better go.
- After the party, eh?
- No. No, now, please.
- You heard the lady. Out!
Yeah, sure, we go.
Thank you very much, sir.
A girl with a shape like yours can do better than two-bit winos.
I'm The Banker.
Who gave you permission... to set up shop in my territory?
The Catholic Action Committee.
Well, nowadays, everybody's got a piece of the action.
Did you stick something in your eye, Tomas?
- Mm-hmm. Somebody put their fist into his eye.
- Yeah, but I hit him good first.
I don't let nobody call my sister a dirty, stinking bitch.
She ain't dirty.
Well, you better let Desiree fight her own battles, because she ain't lost one yet, pal.
Hey, Doc, could I see you a second?
I, uh, have a problem.
Okay. Put two drops in your eye every four hours.
- And you better put a patch on the champ's eye.
- Yes, Doctor.
- Desiree!
- Oh, Doc. I have such a pain in my left chest.
- Your left chest? Now wait a minute.
- Mm-hmm. A construction.
- A what?
- A construction. I swear it on my mother's grave.
- Your mother's alive.
- So, it could be something serious.
All right. I better not take any chances.
There?
Um... yeah, right here.
And it hurts when you breathe, right?
Yeah, yeah, it hurts.
- Doc?
- A very interesting case.
Well, what is it?
- You know, you're lucky you came to me when you did.
- Oh, Doc, I was only kidding.
No.
- I don't know how to tell you this, kid.
- But-But... you've got to do something.
There's nothing I can do.
You mean, I ain't gonna get over it?
Oh, you'll get over it.
Well, what's wrong?
It's called Septum Decimises.
Huh? What's that?
That means that you're 17 years old.
Uh, Doctor?
Mrs. Rodriguez is here.
Uh, that's all, Camille.
Yeah, for now.
Mm.
- Hello?
- Doctor, I think you better get over here right away.
Yeah. Okay.
You can stop the oxygen, Irene.
- Is she...
- No, she's breathing very well on her own now.
But it was touch-and-go for a while.
Did you call the ambulance, Michelle?
It's on its way.
Good. You go back to the clinic with me.
We've done all we can do here.
Irene, you better stay until the ambulance gets here.
Hey, Doc.
You call that specialist yet?
He's supposed to get back to me by the end of the week.
- Miss Parker?
- Yeah?
I want to see Amanda in my office late Friday afternoon.
Okay?
Whatever you say, Doc.
You bring order and organization into my life... and you're gonna ruin everything.
How are things at the hospital?
Oh, just fine.
Miss Kempton goes home today.
Oh. You really saved her life.
You were absolutely wonderful.
You were pretty good yourself, for a religious fanatic.
Well, I'll, uh...
I'll have Irene put her on the visiting list for tomorrow, Doctor.
We have a rule around here.
Any nurse that lasts out a full week... gets to call the doctor by his first name.
Well, I'll try to remember that... John.
And we celebrate by having a drink.
Oh, we don't drink.
We don't drink?
Well, uh, wh-what I mean is... a little wine, occasionally.
We... I...
What I mean is I...
I, uh, don't drink.
Well, if a nurse doesn't drink, then we usually have dinner.
Yes, I'll bet you do.
But there's no chance.
We're going to try to shame the landlord into painting the apartment.
You're gonna have to stop throwing yourself at me like this... or people will start talking.
Oh, by the way, you were right about Amanda.
She is autistic, she's not deaf,
'cause I heard her whistle.
Well, I can start working with her right away.
I'll have to gain her confidence.
Show her love and affection.
There are new techniques that get results a lot faster.
You mean rage reduction?
I'd rather try patience and love.
I hope we got that much time.
Y-You f-forget me.
No, of course not, Julio.
Just go into the office.
I'll be right with you.
You be all right?
We'll be fine.
It's too bad about dinner.
I was even gonna pick up the check.
So much?
Oh, that's sheer highway robbery.
- You ought to take out a license to steal, mister.
- Butt out, kid.
You are a walking social injustice.
Every week I try to save money come Feast of Juan de Cheguez... so I can buy gifts for the little ones.
San Juan de Cheguez?
Hey, isn't he the patron saint of Caribbean fisherman?
Oh, you know him?
Yeah.
Oh, in Puerto Rico, we have big fiesta... parade in the streets, bless the boats.
- Here, they do nothing but try to steal from you.
- You're holding up the line.
Wait a minute.
She gave you a 10 bill dollars.
Oh, gracias.
Muchas gracias, senorita.
- Oh, for the Feast of San Juan de Cheguez.
- Oh, muchas gracias.
Mm.
Noodle ring again, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Noodle ring again.
Got it!
Yeech!
Uh, if you don't like my noodle ring... you should have accepted
Dr. Carpenter's invitation to dinner.
I would have.
That'll be five Hail Marys.
Nuns and men don't mix.
Oh, I think he's cute.
- Fifteen.
- Honest. He's groovy.
Twenty-five.
Evening, ladies.
Evening.
Brown paper bags.
I could hear the muscatel bottles rattle.
All right, out of the way, girls, unless you want to get painted.
Luis, Raoul, start moving the furniture away from the walls.
Chino, you'll mix the paint.
I know your landlord.
He doesn't shame so easily.
It's too bad Chino and the rest of the boys couldn't stay for dinner.
Maybe they're not partial to noodle ring like I am.
Tell me, as a doctor... would you diagnose what's happening today... the riots, the student unrest... as not really the death throes of an old Order...
But the birth pains of a new one?
- I didn't know I was making a house call.
- Oh, well, I mean... don't we all, each in our own way, have to man the barricades?
- At the Ajax Market?
- Um.. If we're all finished?
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
We give Thee thanks,
Almighty God... for all Thy benefits which we have received from Thy bounty... through Christ, our Lord, amen.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
- I hear it's good for the digestion.
- It is.
"Fiesta San Juan de Cheguez.
August 3, 4:00 to whatever.
Free food, soft drinks.
Support your local patron saint. What is that?
- Well, we're sponsoring it next Saturday.
- I'm against this.
I think we're here to do a job, not get involved.
Well, I'm for it.
It'll make an awful lot of people very happy.
And happy people are closer to God.
Look, I don't get it.
What are you, nurses or missionaries?
I think you should drop the whole thing.
The hospital can't handle the usual casualties on Saturday night.
Oh, look,
Chino forgot his guitar.
- Won't he need this?
- He could always steal another one.
- Oh.
- Do you think there'll be trouble?
Trouble?
At the fiesta?
You know how it is on a Saturday night down here.
You get everybody together... blowing out their skulls, and all the old hates come out... and you may wind up with World War III on your hands.
Oh, please don't say that.
It's important to us.
Okay.
Go ahead and have your party for old Sam Chavez.
But if you really want to get to know some of the kids around here... why don't you come down to the park on a Saturday afternoon... when we play touch football?
Oh.
Let me show you how to do this.
Put these three fingers right here, honey. Like that.
Go ahead.
That's right.
Now this one right here.
Very good.
Now these three here.
What?
These three right here.
Now you got a complete chord change.
Now, see, go back to this one.
Um...
Right.
Now back to this one.
Disgusting movie.
You were right making that man give us our money back.
When you see pictures like that... you realize what a great force for good Irene Dunne was.
Say, I didn't know you could do that.
At this hour.
It's got to be an orgy.
Hey, this is fun.
Father Gibbons will certainly want to hear about this.
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready.
Ah, come on.
Come on.
- That was really terrific.
- Um, give me a hand. Let's get this picture up.
- I'll help.
- That's okay. We can do it ourselves. Thank you.
It's okay.
I'm better in the kitchen anyway.
What do you know?
We're finally alone.
John, uh, please don't.
I get the feeling there's a message here.
Like maybe there's somebody else?
You... you could say that, yes.
Message received.
Good night, Michelle.
Why don't you join the Y.M.C.A?
You'd save us both a lot of wear and tear... if you'd learn to duck every once in a while, okay?
Okay, Miss Parker.
Come on.
Mandy.
Mandy, come on.
Barbara, take over.
I don't want to be disturbed... unless it's an emergency.
Do you see that?
Put it right there in that hole.
Come on, darling, take it.
Take it.
Put it in your hand.
That's a girl.
Now put it right...
Ah. Mm-hmm.
Let's try that one more time.
Put it right here.
Come on, put it...
No, no, no. No. Put it...
All right, Amanda, let's try again.
Put it right... there.
Amanda, put it there.
You can do it. Come on.
You're doing it.
Come on, baby.
Good girl, Amanda.
Very good...
- It's not gonna work, Michelle.
- I don't expect to make too much progress at first.
She's hiding behind a wall of anger.
It's not gonna work.
I'll take over. We'll try rage reduction.
Take her doll away from her.
No, Amanda.
No more toys, baby.
You got to learn to start loving people.
I'm gonna hold you till you get rid of all your hate.
Get as mad as you can.
Then you can start to give love and take love.
Try to get away from me, baby. Try and get away.
I love you, Amanda.
Don't you like when people love you?
Come on. I want to see you get as mad as you can get.
Get all that hate out of you.
Miss Gallagher?
He won't hurt her.
Let's see how mad you can get, baby.
Oh, um, I'm sorry.
The doctor's tied up right now.
I come back tomorrow.
Get mad.
Come on, let it out.
It's Amanda.
I can take over here.
Why don't you go in and help them?
Okay.
I love you, Amanda.
I love you.
Love you, baby.
Is that as mad as you can get?
Michelle.
Get as mad as you can get.
Hold her feet.
It's okay.
We're not gonna hurt her.
Come on, show us how mad you can get.
- Get mad.
- I love you, Amanda.
Come on, fight.
You can do better than that..
For somebody who loves you.
- Is that as mad as you can get?
- Come on, that's a girl.
Good girl.
Come on, Miss Parker, we'll wait outside.
- Look at me. Look at me.
- Get good and mad, Amanda.
Get mad.
Love you.
I love you, Amanda.
- Is that the best you can do for somebody who loves you?
- We love you, Amanda.
Come on, that's it. Fight.
Get mad, Amanda.
Come on, show us how mad you can get.
Get as mad as you can, Amanda.
Come on, you can do better than that.
Let it out.
Yell. That a girl.
Let it all aut.
- We love you, baby.
- Let it go.
- Come on, baby. Get mad.
- Mad.
Big girl.
You can talk, Amanda.
Mad. Mad.
Mad.
That's a girl.
Say it louder. Mad!
Mad.
Very good.
Say it as loud as you can, mad!
Mad!
Oh, Amanda, we love you.
Love you.
Love you.
Love.
Love.
Love...
Love... you.
- You.
Love you.
Love you.
Love you.
Love you.
Yes, that's a big girl.
Big girl.
Big girl.
Big girl.
Yeah.
Yes, sweetheart. Yes.
I want you to show them how you can get real good and mad, like a big girl.
I want you to hit my hand as hard as you can.
Come on, you can do better than that.
Hit it hard.
Good, baby. Hit it again.
Very good.
Hit it again.
Good. Good, baby.
Hit it again, one more time.
Good girl.
That's a big girl.
You gonna give me a hug?
You wanna go home?
Home.
Amanda?
Come.
Oh.
Hungry.
You did it.
We did it.
Um... excuse me.
Those two trees are the goals at that end... these two trees are the goals down here.
Trash cans are out of bounds.
Two hands below the waist.
You understand the rules?
In the words of the master, fake it for 32 bars.
Let's go.
Hey, where's Irene?
She has too many house calls to make.
Here we go.
I fell.
You understand? I fell.
You've been beaten.
- I'll have to report this to the police.
- No! They will kill him.
- Who will kill him?
- The Banker. You don't know how...
You listen to me now.
You fix my ribs, you give me pills.
This your job.
Anything else, we all get hurt.
You'll have to keep him in bed.
He cannot go to work in this condition.
He has to.
They will come back for the money on payday.
Cool it.
Junk ain't our bag, sister.
Hey, brother:
She don't want to be our sister.
- If you'll excuse me, I have calls to make.
- They'll wait.
We gotta know where you stand.
I'm a nurse.
That's where I stand.
There's no room down here for innocent bystanders.
You're either part of the problem or you're part of the solution.
We've got a feeling you're neither.
Well, I'm a Negro.
I think that's pretty obvious.
Now where you been, sister?
We ain't Negroes, we're black.
Not her.
She's just been dipped in maple syrup.
You don't talk to me about being black.
I've been black all my life.
- So I don't want to hear that.
- Everything but the soul.
- You copped aut.
- I never have. I've done my part.
For you. Not for us.
See, you're locked in with those ofay chicks.
Well, you can't have it both ways.
Get it together or get out.
You're too pretty not to stay pretty.
Hike!
Cut back, Carlos!
Touchdown!
Atta way, Carlos!
- Oh, you should have had it. You should have had it.
- Oh, no! I'm sorry!
- Where'd you learn to pass like that, kid?
- I had five brothers.
- They taught you?
- No, I taught them.
- Oh.
- We gotta kick off.
Ah.
Okay, gang, let's go.
Here we go.
Block their defensive tackle coming in this time.
If he tries to get past me...
Pffft... I cut him. Cool it.
Fifteen-yard penalty.
Illegal use of knives.
Now look, you guys block, and you go short right over the line.
Okay, break!
Red dog that passer!
Okay, down Set.
All right, go team. Come on!
Hike!
You blindsided me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm a little overtrained, kid.
Okay, the Slum Bowl Game is now part of sports history.
So how about an ice cream cone, huh?
Oh, I'd love it.
- Hey, let's find Amanda. She loves ice cream.
- Okay.
A few hours on a Sunday afternoon, and then back to Washington Street.
Washington Street.
It sounds as if it should have elm trees... and frame houses with big white pillars in front.
What brought you to the clinic?
A sergeant in my outfit in the army named Cal Edwards.
He was from Washington Street.
- You don't want to hear about it, do you?
- Cal Edwards.
He's not one of our patients, is he?
He was killed on the other side of the world.
Where's the ice cream stand?
He must have been a very good friend of yours.
He saved my life once.
So I figured I owed him and Washington Street a few of the years he gave me.
Anyway, I learned more here than I would in the suburbs... giving out diet pills and vitamin shots.
Say it, Amanda.
Go on, say it.
Ice cream, ice cream, ice cream.
Good girl.
Let's get some.
Up we go, baby.
That's a girl.
Amanda wants strawberry.
Make that two.
And for the missus?
Uh... chocolate.
Here you go, kiddo.
What do you say?
- Good.
- Good. Very good.
That'll be 30 cents.
Amanda, how about a nice, big smile?
A little smile?
How about a grin?
This calls for a special kind of magic.

Hey, Julio!
Well, now, why do you suppose he ran off like that?
Julio's a boy with big problems.
It's his stuttering, makes him feel inadequate.
I am making headway with him.
You take away his stuttering, you're going to find he has a deeper problem.
I don't think you want any part of that.
Oh, thank you.
Maybe you're wrong about Julio.
You were wrong about Amanda.
I hope so.
There's one thing I'm not wrong about, Michelle.
The other night when I put my arms around you, it was no accident.
It was intentional.
And I learned something from it,
'cause you didn't quite level with me.
There isn't anyone else.
Thanks for an absolutely marvelous day.
Now you know how the other half plays.
Well...
Me for the sack.
And me for the sackcloth and the ashes.
Church?
I gotta talk to somebody.
Oh, you're not going all the way uptown to the convent at this hour?
No, we have a church right here in the neighborhood.
Father Gibbons?
He will burn you at the stake.
Not exactly an apostle of the ecumenical movement.
Uh, no, more the Inquisition.
But still a priest.
I better get changed.
A lovely supper, ladies:
I'll look for you at early mass.
Father Gibbons,
I'm so glad I ran into you.
Oh, we were playing touch football in the park.
Notre Dame,
French for "Our Lady."
But I don't think Our Lady'd be very proud to claim you now.
Father, we've done nothing to be ashamed of.
Men in your rooms. Late parties.
Profane music till all hours.
Forsaking the habit was one thing, but now you're not even dressed like females.
Father...
I've had enough of you.
- I want you out of my parish.
- Oh, please don't say that.
I'll have none of your arguments.
I've called Bishop Finley... and we're seeing him at 11:00 on Monday morning.
If you feel you can make a case for your conduct, do it then.
Good night...
Sisters.
Hello, I was looking for you.
I can't help you, Banker,
I'm not a veterinarian.
That's funny.
No, you shook down a manager of the Ajax Market.
That's not so funny.
You stay away from my clientele.
You stay away from my clinic.
Oh, I got clientele in your clinic.
You ask that nurse that's working for you.
Good morning, doctor.
Good morning.
I'm going to help you out with early customers.
Michelle and Barbara had to go uptown.
- Some kind of meeting?
- Mmm... some kind of meeting is right.
What business do you have with The Banker?
A hundred dollars worth.
It's my contribution to the Feast of San Juan de Cheguez.
You can't borrow money from The Banker.
Oh, I thought it was practically a neighborhood tradition.
So is knife fighting and joy popping.
Well, I have a week to pay him back, until the fiesta.
Let's see, six-to-five, that's 120 for the 100.
And if the borrower doesn't pay back,
The Banker usually breaks a leg or a head.
You're really asking for trouble, Irene.
Yes, I am.
I have no intention of paying him back.
- You don't understand...
- No, it's you who don't understand, Dr. Carpenter.
You see I've decided Barbara's right.
We have to get involved.
- I've been running from reality.
- Oh, come on.
A nurse is usually up to her ears in reality.
No. I have to face it.
I have used my vocation to get away from all the things I've ever known.
Doctor, do you know what it is to be really poor?
I mean, hungry and frightened?
To be black?
I've been all those things, except black.
While little white girls were playing with dolls and wearing party dresses...
I was dodging drunks in dark hallways... praying I could get away from the stench of the ghetto... so I could be somebody, not just another nigger in the streets.
Good morning.
Oh, Miss Parker, Amanda.
Just have a seat in the waiting room.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Irene, it's not my place to tell anybody when to fish or cut bait.
Let's just hope it doesn't turn out to be fish or get your throat cut.
They shame the other fine Sisters of the cloth, who know their place.
Our place is where we're needed.
How we dress in unimportant.
You're no longer needed in my parish.
Something is needed in your parish, Father Gibbons.
There are new methods, innovations. For instance... you might try bringing more people back into the church by having a mass in Spanish.
Or a folk mass.
Don't instruct me, Sister.
I've preached more sermons in my time than you'll ever hear.
Yes, I'm sure we can always count on you to tell it like it was, Father.
I apologize to you for that, Father.
I approved this project in the first place
Because we all realized that we need new methods, new forms to reach this generation:
But some of the incidents that
Father Gibbons has been describing to me.
But no one knows we're nuns, Your Excellency.
You know, Sister Barbara.
- Tell the commissioner I can see him at 2:00 this afternoon.
- Yes, sir.
I realized it was a great risk sending them out to mix with the world...
And not have them mixed up by it.
Inexperienced people who get emotionally involved can often do more harm than good.
Among our first lessons is the importance of order, discipline.
Not license and wantonness.
I want them out of my parish and I want this festival they've dreamed up canceled.
The whole neighborhood's been sharpening their switch knives.
And polishing their brass knuckles for the past two weeks.
Maybe we should consider canceling this celebration... before it endangers the whole project.
We can't do that,
Your Excellency.
These people are counting on celebrating the Feast Day of San Juan de Cheguez.
We must not disappoint them.
All right, Sister.
You can go ahead with it.
If you'll excuse me,
Your Excellency.
You're excused, Father Gibbons.
San Juan de Cheguez...
I doubt he ever drove a single snake out of Puerto Rico.
- Thank you, Your Excellency.
- Thank you.
I do think, however, that the Sisters must resume wearing their habits.
I can't think of one good reason.
Well, may I give you two?
First, none of us wants to embarrass the church.
Equally important...
Wearing your habits guarantees you a certain amount of personal safety.
After all, the church doesn't need martyrs in wholesale lots.
But there's so much we haven't accomplished yet as women.
It's either that or you return to the convent.
Thank you, Your Excellency.
Mother Joseph.
Mother Joseph.
Rose! For the love of heaven, you've got to see this.
Good morning, ladies.
They're nuns.
Saints preserve us, they're nuns.
Wild parties, pagan music, men at all hours.
Whatever they done, they must've had good cause.
Good morning, Desiree.
Oh, uh... if you like, I have a dress you might want to wear to the fiesta tonight.
Yeah, sure. Okay.
We can hardly wait.
We're really going to blow this block apart.
As a favor to us, I fervently hope that you don't do that.
And I was worried about you and the doc.
Yes, well, then, if you'd like to come over this afternoon.
Uh, Sisters, why don't you go on to the clinic without me?
Please, tell doctor Carpenter
I'll be there as soon as I can.
I have a rendezvous with destiny at the Ajax Market.
Sister Barbara!
I know. Order and discipline.
Well, I'm being willfully disobedient.
That is called doing your own thing.
Are you sure you don't want me to go to the clinic with you?
No, no. You've got your calls to make.
A dollar-seventeen.
For you, Sister, 85 cents.
Oh, well, thank you, sir.
You're welcome.
Oh, it's you!
- John?
- Oh, you're early. Good.
John, I want to talk to you.
We got those polio shots today.
We'll have kids coming out of the woodwork.
John, please.
You gotta be kidding.
I'm a member of the Order of the Little Sisters of Mary.
We were only going to be here for two months.
John, please say something.
I'll be damned.
I'm sorry.
We would've gone away, and you and I would never have seen each other again.
You could've told me, you know.
I couldn't.
It was an experiment.
We weren't to tell anyone that we were nuns.
Even after you saw I was getting hung up on you.
That was wrong for both of us.
I took vows.
Didn't you take a vow of honesty?
Hello?
Excuse me, please. Thank you.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you.
Uh, pardon me, please.
Thank you.
Get the fire hoses and the police dogs.
We are not moving.
We are here to end the discriminatory practices in the Ajax Market.
I don't employ obsolete tactics to deal with a contemporary situation.
Buenos dia's,
Señora Gavilan.
Buenos dia's, Señor Officer.
Mm-hmm... do you hear him threatening her?
He asked her how her legs felt.
Call in your goons.
Fire your tear gas bombs.
In a potentially violent confrontation, it's imperative law enforcement officials... should conduct themselves with calm and understanding.
Club us! Load us into that paddy wagon out there... and we will bear our scars proudly.
The only scars you'll bear will be splinters,
Sister Barbara.
A law officer should always remember to keep his own good humor...
Even in the face of vituperative comment and obscenities.
Dirty establishment fink!
I destroyed property.
I fermented a riot.
I demand to be arrested.
You're not going to get your wish.
Where are the reporters and the television cameras?
I want to be dragged out by my heels.
If you care to come by the station house... we might discuss environmental social pressures and how they affect present-day society.
Ooh, police brutality!
Come on. Let's go.
Hmph.
Who's there?
St-Statue.
Stay where you are!
For fiesta.
Dirty, little thief!
Come back! Thief!
Robber! Vandal!
Come back here!
You want mustard?
All right, two with mustard.
Lieutenant.
Everything's quiet so far.
No sign of the Hernandez kid, Julio.
- When you find him, try to take him quietly.
- Yes, sir.
Hello, John.
I'm glad you decided to come tonight, John.
Yeah.
Well, what do you think of our party?
I can feel the lid rattling.
When it blows, you're gonna need a doctor.
Hello, Amanda!
I've been looking all over for you.
Hello, Miss Parker.
Hello.
You having a good time?
I think you've been having hot dogs.
I see a little mustard here and there.
Isn't it just terrific?
I never thought we'd get this many people.
The magic combination.
Sam Cheguez and free booze.
Alcohol?
Where did that come from?
I got an idea.
Oh, I see. I see.
Mother Joseph! Oh, I'm so glad you could come.
Well, the fishing catch of Puerto Rico should reach record proportions this year.
This is Amanda.
She's a little shy with strangers.
Sometimes she likes her puppet to do the talking for her.
Hello, dear.
And what is your name?
My name is Irene.
When little white girls was playing with dolls...
I was praying
I could be somebody... and not just another nigger in the streets.
Oh, dear.
You borrowed money.
I want it back.
You're not gonna get it.
You have made a donation.
Now look here, Sister... whatever it is you are...
- your time's up.
- I've declared a moratorium on that debt.
A moratorium for the whole neighborhood.
- You better cool it, Irene.
- Butt out!
Stop the music!
Stop the music!
In honor of
San Juan de Cheguez...
All debts to The Banker are hereby canceled.
- You sure do like trouble, Irene.
- She's gonna get it.
What are you gonna do?
Beat up the whole neighborhood?
Break a hundred arms?
A thousand legs?
It's lucky for you you're wearing that gunnysack, dinge.
Well, don't let that stop you.
You keep talking, it won't.
Go ahead, beat up a nun.
Great public relations, you.
You small-time gorilla.
You looking for trouble...
Break it up!
Right along the barricades.
Along the barricades.
Cool it! Cool it!
Stay put till I call you.
Break it up.
Move it.
Nobody sent for the fuzz, man.
We're just naturally interested in any kind of trouble.
There ain't no trouble here, man.
You've got my gilt-edged, triple-bonded guarantee... Lieutenant.
I'll settle for that.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Come on, man: Now cool it.
Everybody cool it.
Let's have a good time.
Come on. Break it up.
Go on, dance.
Have fun. Start the music.
Um, I'd like to thank you.
We help our own, Sister.
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm quite all right.
Sister Michelle, I'd like all of you to make arrangements... to return to the convent.
Tomorrow will be soon enough.
But Mother Joseph, the worst is over.
Or yet to come.
Hey, Sister. Sister?
How do you like what I did to that dress you give me?
I made what they call a few alterations.
And everybody said
I looked like a real lady.
I mean, like...
Thanks, Sister.
Sister Barbara, Bishop Finley told us to wear our habits or else.
Well...
I guess I've chosen or else.
I'm going uptown to tell Mother Joseph.
I would have told her earlier, but,
I-I didn't want to spoil the party.
- Barbara!
- Sister Michelle, I am too limited as a nun.
Everything in life has limitations.
I know. I know.
But I want to pick my own.
I want to grow up in my own way.
We'll miss you.
I'll be back.
I may be giving up the religious life, but I'm not giving up the fight.
I've organized a political advancement committee right here in the neighborhood.
And we have our first meeting tomorrow morning.
Look, we've scored two victories today already.
The Ajax Market and The Banker.
And now is no time to stop.
You are... too much.
Put that down.
No. Knife make me... big man.
I want to help you.
Bring statue back for you.
Priest want to put me in jail.
Go to the police.
Give yourself up.
- No go back.
- I'll explain to them.
Not my friend.
No more.
You lie.
Make a fool of me.
- No.
- Show what kind of man I am.
Please!
No!
Julio, please.
No!
Julio!
No! Oh, God!
It was appropriate, wasn't it, delivering a baby on this special night?
Well, I come from a long line of people... who believe in getting married, having kids, raising a family.
Our church believes in that too.
Not for nuns.
Oh... please... no!
Oh, please!
That's Michelle.
Call the police, quick.
Shut up! I kill you!
John, don't hurt him.
Are you all right?
I tried.
I tried.
It's okay, honey.
It's all over now.
It's okay.
Sometimes making a decision can be terribly painful.
I should have come to you sooner, Mother Joseph.
Well, you need time to explore your own feelings.
You've got to choose the kind of love you want.
Physical love, or the love you can find only through prayer.
From my own experience,
I can tell you... that nothing is more painful than no decision.
I'm finding that out.
Well, perhaps an outside stimulus will help you.
Dr. Carpenter is here.
Hello, John.
Michelle.
It's been a long time.
A long time.
How's Julio?
Father Gibbons is coming out of the Middle Ages.
He's not going to press charges.
And Julio's under psychiatric care.
I'm so glad.
When he gets out of the hospital, he's still gonna need a speech therapist.
You'll find someone.
Look, I don't know if I'm breaking any rules about being here or not...
- Oh, of course not, John.
- Or if you have a rule against the way I feel about you.
Well, the fact that I'm a nun doesn't stop me from being a woman.
And it doesn't change the way I feel about you.
On the way up here
I had it all figured out.
I was just going to lay all my cards on the table.
But this place can slow you down, you know what I mean?
I wish there were an easy answer.
Would you be committing a sin if you were to leave here and get married?
In marriage, you love God through one person.
As a nun, I made a commitment to love God through all people.
But this place is not a prison.
You can get a release, you know.
But, in leaving... in marriage...
I'd be giving up the freedom to dedicate myself... to people who need me desperately.
Let's try to find a way, Michelle.
I thought I'd found my way... until I met you.
Things are different now, you said that yourself.
Because I love you.
And no matter what I do,
I'll still love you.
Even if I stay in the Order, nothing's gonna change that.
If you stay in the Order?
John, I know it's not fair not to give you an answer.
But I honestly don't know if I can.
Why don't you try?
John, I have to go.
Please?
"Believe it or not I'm still down here on Washington Street.
I'm working every day with my group, and are we way out!"
It's from Barbara.
What's an "infrastructional sphere of mechanistic behaviorism"?
- You think she's a communist?
- Oh, no, no.
Well, whatever it is, she's happy with it.
You seem happy too.
- Peace. Sister, it's wonderful.
- So I've heard.
You are never going to be able to fish or cut bait until you see that young man again.
Shall we go?
Go where?
Where do all good little nuns go on Sunday? To church.

On the day I was born
Said me father, said he
''I've an elegant legacy
Waiting for ye
'Tis a rhyme for your lip
And a song for your heart
To sing it whenever
The world falls apart''
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
'Twas a sumptuous gift
To bequeath to a child
For the lure of that song
Keeps me head runnin' wild
'Tis a rhyme for me lip
And a song for me heart
And I sing it whenever
The world falls apart
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
So I bundled me heart
And I roamed the world free
To the East with the light
To the West with the sea
And I searched all the earth
And I scanned all the skies
But I found it at last
In my own true love's eyes
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Eureka!
-Sharon, come quickly.
-What is it now, Father?
We're here. lt's journey's end.
Our destination at last.
Thank heaven. Now l can sit down.
No, you can't sit you down. lt's the hill beyond yon hill. l've been hearing about the hill beyond yon hill ever since we left Ireland.
Keep your distance. Don't crowd around.
Clear the way.
-Step aside.
-What's going on here?
-They're gonna have an auction.
-A what?
They're gonna have it today.
You gonna get this auction started now or ain't you?
Hear ye! Hear ye!
Now, wait a minute!
You can't have an auction without first talking to Susan Mahoney.
-Why not?
-Henry, go get Susan.
Because her brother owns this property, that's why not.
I beg your pardon.
The law states this property belongs to anybody who can pay the back taxes.
-And that's me.
-You mean, Senator Rawkins has it.
-You're just his stooge.
-And Woody don't like stooges.
-Who's Woody?
-He's Susan's brother.
He's nothing but a troublemaking con man.
He is not. Woody's president...
...and general sales manager of the
Rainbow Valley Tobacco Cooperative.
Incorporated.
-What's that?
-Us!
-They're sharecroppers.
-Sure are.
That's how we'll all get rich together.
Woody promised me personally.
-Susan's trying to tell you something.
-I'm listening.
-What she say, Henry?
-She says Woody's coming.
-Woody.
-Woody?
-l didn't hear her say anything.
-Naturally, she was born silent.
One of the few women ever was.
Sure, mister. She don't do ''talk'' talk.
She does foot talk.
Foot talk? That's ridiculous.
-What's she saying now?
-She says you gotta wait for Woody.
He's bringing the money.
Quiet!
-Tax sale gonna start now.
-lt's all right. Woody's coming.
Woody's coming.
Woody's coming. Woody's coming.
Woody's coming.
It's my duty to protect the people of Rainbow Valley.
-Who from?
-From the people of Rainbow Valley.
Hear ye, hear ye.
We can't be bothered with the mortgage man--
This time of the year!
You'll be sorry interfering with the law.
For spring don't care
About the mortgage man
This time of the year
I'm giving you your last chance to get back your land.
The dandelions in the dusky dell
Don't give a hoot in hell
-They're gonna smell without collateral
-This time of the year
-This time
-This time of the year
-Sweet merry buds and elderberry buds
-Don't give a good ding-ding-dang
Corn's shooting up
Fruit trees a-fruitin' up
Go tell Rawkins to go hang-hang
Don't mess around here
This time of the year
You'll get it in the rear
This time of the year
Magnolia's are sentimental
Persimmons are queer
Keep your distance, now.
Give way, there.
You hear me? l said, keep your distance.
Don't easily skeer
They sprout without real-estaters
This time of the year
That choo-choo's comin'
And it's mighty clear
Woo, woo, Woody's here
He's up there ridin' with the engineer
Yes, Woody's here
Just look at that choo-choo puffin'
Let's give it a mighty cheer
Just look at that engine huffin'
Dang blast it all, Woody's here
Woody's here!
Get a load of that whistle blowin'
That whistle is good to hear
It's wantin' you to be knowin'
Dang blast it all, Woody's here
Woody's here!
Woody's here!
And to think l let you whisk me out of lreland...
...across an ocean and down a continent...
...in the sweet, green month of April.
And for what?
For a beautiful new life in a beautiful new land.
-We came here to cure your arthritis.
-Aye, that too. That too.
Well, it's me that's cured of your arthritis. lt's all mythical, and so is that cure place for it called Rainbow Valley.
Now you've gone just a bit too far.
Here l have it on me map, witnessed and endorsed by Rand and McNally. l don't know who Rand is, but l could never trust a McNally.
But you can always trust a McLonergan.
Behold, that mythical land called Rainbow Valley.
Sharon, shake hands with a millionaire.
-A millionaire?
-A multimillionaire.
-Now what's happened to your arthritis?
-That's for the poor. l knew you were up to something. Now, will you stand still and listen to me? l can't. l can't. Oh, no.
Ever since l was 2, you've been seeing leprechauns...
...and rainbows over your whiskey jug.
Now, what pixified fancy of yours has really brought us to America, huh?
You'll love it here. You'll have everything you left behind in Glocca Morra.
You hear that?
What did l tell you? The same skylark music we have back in lreland.
-Aye, a Glocca Morra skylark.
-Aye.
I hear a bird
A Glocca Morra bird
It well may be he's bringin' me
A cheerin' word
I hear a breeze
A River Shannon breeze
It well may be
It's followed me across the seas
Then tell me please
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leapin' there?
Does it still run down to Donny Cove
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that willow tree still weepin' there?
Does that laddie with the twinklin' eye
Come whistlin' by
And does he walk away
Sad and dreamy there
Not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow
And each brook along the way
And each lad that comes a-whistlin'
''Too-ra-lay''
How are things in Glocca Morra...
... these fine days?
Oh, now, Father, why are you crying?
Oh, it's that cheap lrish music.
Where is everybody?
-Hello?
-Hello?
Where are all the children?
What the devil?
He's up there ridin' with the engineer
Yes, Woody's here
Someone's coming. You better get up in that tree and take a look.
Don't easily skeer
They'll sprout without real-estaters
This time of the year lt's only the folk who live here.
America's full of gangsters, you know.
You said it was full of millionaires.
Don't argue.
Can't be bothered
With the mortgage man
This time of the year
Here. Take this.
The spring don't care
About the mortgage men
This time of the year lt's-- lt's gold.
-Aye. lt's a pot of gold.
-And you stole it.
-l never stole it. l borrowed it.
-But...
...who did you borrow it from?
-Why do you want to know?
-So we can lend it back.
-lt's impossible.
-Why not?
Because he's not mortal.
-You killed him.
-Of course not.
He never was mortal. He's a leprechaun.
A leprechaun?
Aye. Who else would have gold in lreland?
They sprout without real-estaters
This time of the year
Now that Woody's here
Now that Woody's here
Now that Woody's here
Now, don't think that this is gonna stop the auction.
You gonna pay them off?
Hey, Howard. You watch me.
Hear ye! Hear ye!
You ain't making a burlesque of the law.
Why not? That's where the law spends most its time.
Seen him in the front row last Monday night, Woody.
-Bet you did.
-Ain't true! Ain't true!
Quiet! This is an unlawful assembly.
Then this unlawful assembly is gonna have to come to order.
All right.
Read it.
Read it.
''Rainbow Valley parcel lot seven...
...is hereby up for auction for default of back taxes...
...in the amount of $ 777.''
-$ 777 going once!
-Yes!
-$ 777 going twice!
-Yes!
-$ 777 going three times!
-Yes!
Sold! To the Rainbow Valley Tobacco
Cooperative lncorporated.
Yeah. That's old Woody.
This covers it, except:
''Service charges, notary services...
...penalty and penal points, convertible debentures...
...miscellaneous and sundry add-on interest.''
Another $ 77.
No, it never said nothing about this in that bill you sent to my sister Susan.
Well, that's how it is with interest.
Don't make a sound.
-Just keeps compounding.
-Ain't you got the balance of the money?
-l figure l'm good for it.
-Cash.
All right, come on, sheriff.
Wait a minute.
Give me a chance to get my money back on this guitar. lt's too late for that.
Money don't grow on trees, you know. lt does for Woody.
Hey, Buzz, say hello to Rawkins!
Rawkins hears about this, we'll both be looking for new jobs.
Come on, sheriff!
Well, now. What do we have here?
-lt's an angel.
-Shame on the frivolous likes of you. lt's an lrish angel.
Your kith and kin pinning their hopes on you...
...and you go squandering your money on a music box. l did it for them. lt's a community guitar.
Aye, and l'm sure that's how you'll use it...
...on every girl in the community.
Daughter, that's no way to be talking to me future business partner.
Partner?
You accepted me money for back taxes, didn't you?
-l intend to pay you back.
-l don't want you to. l just want me property rights.
How much land you think you're entitled to?
An acre or so. All l really need is a parcel of land as big as me bag...
...on the closest point to Fort Knox.
We are in the vicinity of Fort Knox, are we not?
About two miles. ln fact, on a warm night, you can smell the gold.
Have we a deal?
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
-lt's a deal.
-Then give me your hand, son.
-Welcome to Rainbow Valley...
-Hi.
...home of the most prosperous tobacco company...
...in this state.
And l'll wager that.
What's your name?
Sharon McLonergan.
-Mine's Woody Mahoney.
-Mahoney. lt's fate.
How'd you get so pretty...
...and so rich?
You see, back in Glocca Morra where we come from, there's an old legend.
And it says:
You'll never grow old
And you'll never grow poor
If you look to the rainbow
Beyond the next moor
-That's a lovely legend.
-Aye.
-Wonder who thought it up.
-Me father.
Finian McLonergan.
On the day she was born
Said her father, said he
''I've an elegant legacy waiting for ye
'Tis a rhyme for your lip
And a song for your heart
To sing it whenever
The world falls apart
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream''
So I bundled me heart
And I roamed the world free
To the East with the lark
To the West with the sea
And I searched all the earth
And I scanned all the skies
But I found it at last
In my own true love's eyes
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Follow the fellow....
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Bye.
Father?
Now, what would you be doing up at this hour? l'm taking care of you.
Any time the moon is full, a McLonergan will be too.
You go back to bed.
Where are you going with that bag and shovel?
Now, will you leave me be if l tell you?
Aye.
Then let me ask you this.
What do you think makes America different from lreland?
Has more lrishmen. lt has more money.
Everyone in America is rich.
But, Father, are there no poor in America?
No ill-housed and no ill-clad?
Of course. But they're the best ill-housed and the best ill-clad in all the world.
Why? Why, l ask.
And there's no man with wit enough to tell me.
So l'll tell you. Quote me self, quote.
Didn't the Americans rush to dig gold from the ground in California in 1849?
So l've heard.
And didn't they plant it in the soil at Fort Knox later?
-Granted.
-Well, that's it!
You see, there's something about the soil in and around Fort Knox...
...that gives a magical quality to gold.
-Father--
-The gold radiates a powerful influence...
...throughout America. lt activates assembly lines in Detroit...
...it makes skyscrapers sprout from the gutters of New York...
...and it produces a bumper crop of millionaires. And that...
...is the McLonergan theory of economics.
And that's why we came to America?
Aye. To bury me pot of gold.
Now, you go back to bed. lt's a witching night.
Aye. Very scary place. l'll.... l'll.... l'll....
One, two...
...four, five, six, seven, eight.
Green is the color of the shamrock
And the grass on Blarney Hill
Oh, the darlin' green of Ireland
And the good old dollar bill
God be with you.
God and Mary be with ye?
God, Mary and St. Patrick be with ye.
God, Mary, St. Patrick and St. Ozymandias be with ye.
-Ozymandias? l never heard of him.
-He was a special saint.
He's the patron saint of all the leprechauns of Glocca Morra.
-My name is Og.
-Og from Glocca Morra?
-Me native heath.
-Right.
You're an imposter. You can't be a leprechaun, you're too tall! l know, and l'm getting taller! l need your help, Mr. McLonergan.
-Me help?
-Aye.
That calls for a toast. l rise to welcome you to America.
-How are things in Glocca Morra?
-Alas, alack and willy-wally. l weep for Glocca Morra and all lreland.
You weep? Why, what's happened?
A blight has fallen over lreland.
-The British are back.
-Never seen such a curse befall a folk...
...in all me 459 years.
Alas, poor lreland.
-Poor lreland.
-Poor lreland!
-Suffering lreland.
-Suffering lreland!
-The native land!
-Oh, me native land!
A fine lot of fairyfolk you are, letting all this happen.
Why don't you wish it away.
We lost the power.
You mean you've gone and lost the power to make wishes?
-Aye.
-What has lreland to live for now?
-Answer me that.
-Doom and gloom!
Doom and gloom!
-Who's the author of this foul outrage?
-A monster.
-A monster?
-Aye.
You mean the old flame-breathing type, with the head of a dragon?
Oh, no. This is a tiny, wee monster.
He's about...
-...your size.
-Who is he?
Who is this monster?
Excuse me for pointing,
Mr. McLonergan, but it's you.
-Me?
-You brought the blight on yourself...
...when you stole our crock of gold!
The little crock that gives us all the power to wish.
Don't be superstitious, it's bad luck!
-Give it back, Mr. McLonergan.
-How do you know l've got it?
Me magnetic feathers pointed you out all the way from lreland.
Feathers, who's the culprit?
Oh, me arthritis!
Give it back, Mr. McLonergan, before a great evil befalls you.
Can't you postpone your wishing a couple of months?
Gold was never meant for mankind. lt's a fairyland metal that only fairyfolk can use. ln the hands of a mortal, it can only bring...
...doom and gloom.
Doom and gloom!
Doom and gloom.
Stop your wailing, leprechaun. l've come to a decision. l deny your existence.
-You're a figment of me imagination.
-l am?
To prove it, l'm going to walk through you.
Step aside. There, what did l tell you?
This is dreadful.
-l don't exist.
-Of course not. l'm always seeing things.
Ask me daughter.
But if l don't exist, how is it l'm gradually becoming mortal?
-The saints preserve us. You are.
-Aye.
So are all the other little leprechauns ever since you stole our crock of gold.
Look at me. Look! lt's crept past me ankles already.
-Can't you hold out until the winter?
-l don't know. l got a peculiar human feeling in me thighs lately.
Your thighs? Don't let it go any higher, man.
-Mary and Joseph, lreland's ruined.
-Father!
-Someone's coming.
-Me daughter.
And now that you're half mortal, you're indecent. Here, here, take these.
Now, you heard me, now.
You take those clothes and--
Father!
Father!
Sharon!
Mr. McLonergan!
-Father!
-Sharon!
-Father!
-Sharon!
Mr. McLonergan!
-Father!
-What fools these mortals be.
-Mr.--
-Father--
Father!
Now, what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
Oh, it's you, Mr. Mahoney. l was looking for me father.
Not too long ago...
...they find a girl in the forest in the middle of the night...
...they'd think that she was...
...a witch. ls that so? Well.... lf you'll excuse me, l-- l'll be saying good evening to you.
You're not afraid of the werewolves?
Werewolves?
Our valley has its legends too, you know.
Haven't you noticed how strange the sky looks? lt is a trifle strange.
And look at the moon. lt is a cold, full moon.
The legend of the valley:
When the sky is strange...
...and the moon is full...
...the werewolves prowl.
-Unless....
-Unless?
That's a complicated part, and l know you're in a hurry.
Oh, no, Mr. Mahoney. l'd like to know the complicated part of the legend. lt's how to make yourself immune from the werewolf.
Well, how would l be doing that?
Well...
...you have to stand very, very close to the nicest, handsomest fellow around.
That must be you.
Must be.
Then you make yourself comfortable on the grass.
Now, you blink your eyes twice...
...and keep them closed.
Now you say...
...''petrified parsley'' over and over, real fast.
Petrified parsley, petrified parsley, petrified parsley....
-Feel immune yet?
-No.
Petrified parsley, petrified parsley, petrified parsley....
That's a lovely legend.
Who made it up? l did.
I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon
In your eyes
You and your glance
Make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle
You got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
I wanna cry
Wanna croon
Wanna laugh
Just like a loon
It's that old devil moon
In your eyes
I look at you
And glory be
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon
In your eyes
You and your glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night blazin' their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle
You got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
I wanna cry
I wanna croon
I want to laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon
In your eyes
Just when I think I'm
Free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with...
-...love
-Yeah
-Howard, old buddy!
-Hey, Woody!
How's the Luther Burbank of the swamp?
-Mr. Moneybags.
-How you doing? l've been waiting for you.
Where you been?
Sharon, meet Howard.
Howard, this is Sharon.
How do you do? Nice to meet you.
Woody, l'm glad you're here. l got the list all made out.
Fifty feet of styrene tubing, quarter inch,
250 pounds of nitrogen tripalminate--
The voice you hear is the voice of the greatest research botanist today.
He's gonna change our whole way of life...
...and he's gonna do it with these little flowers right here.
-They're all his babies.
-We're doing it together.
Woody thought it up, and l'm growing them up. l ain't nothing but a suede-shoe boy peddling tobacco.
But Howard--
Howard is the first man in history...
...to mate the mint plant with tobacco.
You realize what that means.
No.
You are looking at the mentholated tobacco plant.
Here, smell.
Smell the mint-julep nicotine.
That's nice. Really smells lovely. lt's a whole new form of tobacco life.
-lt only has one drawback.
-What's that?
Well, it doesn't burn. lt doesn't burn? lt's worse than asbestos. lt actually puts fires out.
We're working on it.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
Now that you're all back, fat with cash...
...gotta get to work.
Once l rig the styrene tubing...
...l'll take the nitrogen tripalminate in powdered form--
That's what l've been meaning to talk to you about.
What's that? The styrene tubing or the nitrogen tripalminate in powdered form?
-The cash.
-Yeah, what about the cash? l got some great things going. l made some contacts you wouldn't believe.
Wait, wait. Contacts? No cash?
Not a dime.
Well, you didn't bring back any cash, l'll go out and get some.
How? l'll get a job. Yeah.
But you've got a job, Howard.
That's to make it burn. Make it burn! ls that dedication?
Mr. Mahoney?
You're going to make plenty of money for everyone?
You bet.
Without doing a stitch of work for it?
Why not?
And is that what you call the''Mahoney theory of economics''?
No, but that's a pretty good name for it.
Why don't you grow ordinary tobacco that does burn?
Never get rich that way.
See you soon, Sharon.
Hey, Howard, buddy!
Don't take that personal. He's trained to do that to anyone what ain't white.
-You're the new boy from the agency.
-Yeah.
Okay, Stonewall.
Ain't l seen you somewhere?
-You worked here as a butler, didn't you?
-Oh, no, no.
No, sir.
Well, you'll like working here, boy. l've hired all of the senator's butlers for the past 10 years.
Hundreds of them. Of course, he's a little intolerant at times...
...but that's his blood pressure.
-What's your name?
-Howard.
Let me see you serve that julep.
Rawkins won't like that. That's no way to serve a julep. lt's too fast.
Get some shuffle into it.
You've seen some of the new movies, like Birth of a Nation...
...and Gone With the Wind, haven't you?
-Here, George, like this.
-Howard.
Yeah, okay, Jackson.
Your julep, sir. Master Rawkins, sir.
All frosted and minty....
You see, George?
Why do l have to shuffle?
Now, l don't have to explain that to you. lt makes for kindly feelings between employer and employee.
Once more, now. Try it again.
And not so fast this time.
How did you do that again? l don't understand you, Jackson. l mean, you don't walk or talk like you're supposed to.
You don't know how to serve a julep like you're supposed to.
You educated or something? l'm working on my master's.
Working on your master's what? lt's a college degree.
Now, don't mention the word''college'' around the senator. lt upsets him.
But that's beside the point.
Do you want a job here, or don't you?
Yes, sir, l do. l needs the money.
Well, that's all the more reason for you to make good here.
Then when you get your college degree, why, you got a job here for life.
-Buzz!
-Oh, l'll speak to you later.
You go around back and keep practicing, hear?
-Buzz, where are you?
-l'm over here, senator.
-l can't seem to see you.
-lt's these columns, senator.
-They sort of get in the way.
-Nonsense.
Those columns haven't moved an inch in a hundred years.
Meet me down by the glider.
Yep. Fine job you done yesterday, Buzz...
-...buying up all that land.
-Yes, sir. Bought up the whole valley.
Except one little parcel.
That'll teach them bureaucrats to stay where they belong, in Washington.
Cheap electric power.
Why don't they build their dam on the Potomac...
...instead of desecrating this heaven-given valley...
...with a lot of copper wire.
Electrocuting innocent bullfinches and sparrows.
Gentlemen...
...the festering tides of radicalism are upon us.
But before l yield up our glorious South...
...and her sister commonwealth, the U.S. of A...
...l will lay down my life. l will do more than that. l will filibuster.
Back, you crackpots. Forward, America.
Forward to the hallowed principles of our forefathers.
Forward to the sweet tranquility of the status quo.
Forward to yesterday.
Get this dog off-- Get him off me.
Caught him dead to rights, senator.
Spank on your property.
Oh, damn it, sheriff, can't you arrest a couple of chicken thieves...
...without disturbing the whole countryside?
Worse than chicken thieves this time.
These are geologists from Washington.
Geologists?
Two?
-l only see one.
-Senator.
This is a geological survey of the soil in this area in connection with the dam. l don't need nobody to tell me what's on my land.
Especially one of his kind.
Look, l read the findings on this meter. lt detected gold on your property this afternoon.
You found what on my property? lt located an amazing concentration of gold.
The meter reacted so violently, it broke the needle.
We're sorry about that needle, but we'll reimburse you. Now....
Just where did this unfortunate needle-breaking accident occur?
Parcel lot number seven, right outside Rainbow Valley.
-Oh, my God.
-What are you mumbling about, Buzz? lnvite these gentlemen up on the veranda. lt isn't every day we're honored with the presence...
...of two distinguished scientists from Washington, D.C.
Sorry, senator, we've got more ground to cover.
Gentlemen, l wish you'd accept my hospitality.
Senator?
That was the strip l told you about.
-What strip?
-The one we couldn't buy.
Well, gentlemen, l'm sorry you gotta rush off like this...
...but you hurry back real soon, now, hear?
We couldn't buy it? Who bought it?
We found out it was a man named Finian McLonergan.
Yankee brain!
Why weren't you prepared for him? l never saw him before.
He's an immigrant.
My family's been having trouble with immigrants...
-...ever since they come to this country!
-Don't you get excited!
You'll feel better when you've had your julep.
To hell with my julep!
Get me a Bromo, quick.
Howard!
Howard! Bring the senator a Bromo-Seltzer, quick!
And call my lawyer.
Tell him to find a loophole.
Where's that Bromo?
-Where's that Bromo, Howard?
-My loophole's choking me.
Where's that Bromo?
Coming, master. Coming. l'm coming all in there, yes, sir.
Yeah, l'm coming.
Will you hurry up on that Bromo?!
You're gonna enjoy it once l get to you.
-Get him his Bromo!
-Coming in there fast as l can.
-Will you hurry up with it?!
-Coming right there, fix your head good.
Mercy, sure gonna make you feel like you flying.
-Please, please hurry up with the--
-Come on, Howard!
Come on!
Howard, come on!
-Please bring me my--
-Howard!
Oh, Lord, l'm coming in.
Howard! Come on, bring that!
Get over here!
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that willow tree
Still weepin' there?
Does that laddie
With the twinklin' eye
Come whistlin' by
And does he walk away
Sad and dreamy there
-Sharon!
-Aye?
-Haven't you laundered my shirt yet?
-lt's coming, it's coming.
Not to see me there?
Not so hard. You'll be wringing the lrish out of the linen. lt is the neck of the Mahoney l'm wringing.
Oh, good, good, good. Lover's quarrel.
Healthy sign.
Are you sure? l know true devotion when l see it. l know a fine, upstanding darling of a man when l see one.
He's leaving for parts unknown this morning.
He's what? He's running out on you?
He's off to sell tobacco that doesn't burn. He's a schemer.
-You're well rid of him.
-An impractical dreamer.
-lt's deplorable.
-Total no-good bounder.
Get the wretch out of your mind.
-He's just like you.
-Aye, a darling of a man.
Now, look. Now, just a minute.
Now, don't you be crying.
A special rose...
...for your hair. lt has magical properties.
Beautiful bride you'll be.
All by myself, or is there a man involved?
Aye, there is.
He doesn't know it, but before sundown...
...Mr. Woody Mahoney will find himself betroth-ted to you.
''Betrothed.''
Betroth-ted!
How are things
In Glocca Morra
This...
...fine....
Well, this is a pretty bucket of fish.
How would you explain these shenanigans?
-lf you won't speak, back into the well.
-Oh, no! No!
So you've found your tongue.
Speak up for yourself.
-Why were you hiding in that well?
-l wasn't hiding.
Someone set me on fire, and l had to put myself out.
Oh, l see. Who was it put the torch to you?
A sunbeam.
-A sunbeam?
-Sunbeam disguised as a fairy queen.
But you can't fool me. l know a sunbeam when l see one.
Thank you.
-You're very poetical.
-Don't come too close! l'll have to jump again! l'm beginning to understand. l've known that feeling myself.
-You have?
-Well, only recently.
Came over me this morning, as you were sunning your hair by the brook. ls it a warmish...
...kind of glowish, kind of peculiarish sensation?
Oh, no, it's sort of a shiverish, kind of quiverish, flibbertigibberish sensation.
-Do you feel hummingbirds in your heart?
-Butterflies in my feet.
-Bees in your bonnet?
-Stars in my britches.
Does it make you want to dance?
-l hadn't noticed.
-And sing?
Oh, it does, it does.
Something sweet
Something sort of grandish
Sweeps my soul
When thou art near
My heart feels
So sugar-candish
My head feels
So ginger beer
Something so darish
So''I don't car-ish''
Stirs me from limb to limb
It's so terrifish
Magnifish, delish
To have such an amorish
Glamorish dish
We could be
Oh, so bride-and-groomish
Skies could be
So bluish blue
Life could be
So love-in-bloom-ish
If my ish-es
Could come true
Thou art sweet
Thou art sort of grandish
Thou outlandish cavalier
From now on
We're hand-in-handish
-Romeo
-And Guinevere
Thou art so adorish
Toujour l'amourish
I'm so cherchez la femme
Why should I vanquish
Relinquish, resish?
When I simply relish
This hellish condish
I might be mannish or mouse-ish
I might be a fowl or fish
But with thee I'm Eisenhows-ish
Please accept my proposish
You're under my skin-ish
So please be give in-ish
Or it's the begin-ish
Of the finish of me
What was that splash?
'Twas me, singing a duet.
A duet? By yourself?
Well, it could be, you know.
After all, l'm a witch, remember?
Train's pulling out soon. l wanted to say goodbye.
Well, goodbye.
-What kind of a goodbye is that?
-The best kind. Short, sweet and final.
How come l feel you're losing interest in me?
-Losing? Losing?
-l'm going away so l can come back...
-...and make everybody rich!
-Lost!
Sharon.
We're having a party
We're having a party
Oh, Finian's party we're having today
We're having a party
We're having a party....
Hey, what's going on?
-What's the occasion, Mr. McLonergan?
-What? Haven't you heard the gossip?
Me daughter Sharon's getting betroth-ted today.
Singing a duet with herself!
Sharon's getting betroth-ted
Sharon is getting betroth-ted today
Sharon is getting betroth-ted.... l hope you won't be taking it too hard, son.
-But then you'll be leaving town anyhow.
-l got a deal cooking, Mr. McLonergan-- l understand when a man's got a deal cooking.
He's got to cook it, or it won't get cooked.
On the other hand, many deals are cooked at home in your own pot...
...of gold.
-Gold?
-But then again...
...what is the cold, hard metal compared to the golden hair of the girl you love?
-Nothing.
-You're right.
Then tell me, why are you gallivanting all over the countryside...
...promoting and cooking deals when the lady you fancy is to be betroth-ted?
Well, who's she gonna marry? l hope you won't be after taking it too hard.
Why should l? lt's only love.
-That's a sensible attitude.
-Right.
Wait a minute! Who's the guy?
Now, who is he?
Now, if l tell you, you won't be making any trouble? l promise.
Very well. lt was last night she met him in the forest...
...and they sang about the moon.
Mr. McLonergan, that was me.
-Well, was it, now?
-Yeah.
Are you sure?
Of course! lt was me all along.
Well, that's a blessed relief.
Therefore, it's you that's getting betroth-ted today.
-''Betrothed.''
-Oh, yes, betrothed.
Finian McLonergan.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Susan's trying to tell us something.
-What's she saying?
-l can't tell. lt's a secret.
-Woody, you tell them.
-Okay.
A secret, a secret
She says she's got a secret
A secret, a secret
A secret kind of secret
She's achin' for to shout it
To every daffodil
And tell the world about it
In fact, she says she will
-She says
-She says
If this isn't love
The whole world is crazy
If this isn't love
I'm daft as a daisy
With moons all around
And cows jumpin' over
There's something amiss
And I'll eat my hat if this isn't love
I'm feeling like the apple
On top of William Tell
With this I cannot grapple
-Because
-Because
You're so adora-bell
If this isn't love
Then winter is summer
Give in to summer
-If this isn't love
-If this isn't love
-My heart needs a plumber
-It needs a plumber
I'm swinging on stars
And ridin' on rainbows
I'm bustin' with bliss
And I'll kiss your hand if this isn't love
If this isn't love
There's no Glocca Morra
If this isn't love
I'm Zsa Zsa Gabor-a
If this is a dream
And if I should wake up
Will you hear a hiss
Will my face be red if this isn't love
I'm gettin' tired of waitin'
And stickin' to the rules
This feelin' calls for matin'
Like birds and bees and other animules
If this isn't love
We're all seein' double
If this isn't love
We're really in trouble
-If she's not the girl
-And he's not the hero
A kiss ain't a kiss
It's a crisis, man, if this isn't love
If this isn't love
He's happy to shout
And to tell the world about it
And I'll kiss your hand
If this isn't love
McLonergan!
How dare you come back here? Didn't l tell you you're an optical delusion? l was ready to believe you yesterday, but not today.
-Today l've got proof.
-What proof?
Does an optical illusion feel such a hungry yearning, burning inside of him?
Does an optical illusion feel the beat of the tom-tom...
...in the roaring traffic's boom in his lonely room?
You flying high and wide on a magic-carpet ride...
...full of butterflies inside?
Aye, and what's worse, smoke keeps coming out of me eyes.
You go round like an elevator lost in the tide?
That's the feeling!
Day and night, night and day!
Give me your daughter.
-What's she got to do with it?
-She's the one under my skin.
-Leprechaun, you're playing with fire.
-l know, and the fire's winning! l don't wanna be human. l don't wanna be human.
-lt's too inhuman.
-You're neurotic.
-Who's forcing you to be human?
-You are, by keeping my crock of gold! l'm only lend-leasing it. Give me a few weeks and l'll return it with interest.
Five and a quarter little crocks. l hope you're not using it to make wishes. ln the hands of a mortal it's only good for three, and after it becomes dross.
The way you talk, anyone would think l never had a pot to wish on. l'm sorry, Mr. McLonergan. l'm being a nuisance.
You're damn right you are!
You're worse than that!
You're the nemesis on me premises.
You're endangering me whole project.
-Where's your passport?
-What's that? l thought so. How dare you come into a free country without a passport? l'm legal, all right. l came in as a Christmas tree.
But l'm not leaving till l see me crock!
And l'm seeing me congressman,
Senator Rawkins...
...and l'm having you deported!
You're a member of a subversive, underground group...
...taking its orders from Dublin!
Woody's gettin' betroth-ted
Woody is gettin' betroth-ted today
Hey, mister, did you see our rooster? l got enough troubles of me own, thank you.
What kind of a rooster was he?
-He had pink--
-Green feet--
-And a yellow--
-Wait a minute. Wait!
-How many roosters did you lose?
-One!
-One rooster, all those colors?
-Yeah!
Well, now, let me see, now.
-Would this be it?
-Yeah!
-He must be magic!
-That's right! You get the prize.
-Do you do other magical things too?
-l do, but we'll have to act very quickly.
-l need your help. Will you help me?
-Yeah!
Now, listen. Somewhere hidden in the ground around here...
...is a little yellow crock. lf any of you find it for me, you can pick anything you like...
...here in me little magic book.
That's nothing!
We all have one of those.
Yes, but the difference is, from mine you can have anything you choose.
-Can l have a banjo?
-Can l get a fishing rod?
-Can l have an elephant?
-You can have anything you like...
-...that's made in fairyland.
-Without money?
There'll be things
Plenty-ish for all-ish
Wonderish toys
And magic tricks
Electrish trains
And basketball-ish
Mintish drops
And licorish sticks
Life will be keen-ish
All Halloween-ish
And jelly bean-ish too
With ice cream and cake-ish
And soda to sup
And no bellyache-ish
To wakish you up
There will be
Such delicious dishes
And we'll end
This daffish plot
For we'll go
From rags to rishes
When we find
That goldish pot
There'll be chocolate custish
With hot dogs and mustish
But Shears and Robustish
Must firstish come through
You folks belong here?
Yeah.
You mean you all live here on this property together?
-Yeah.
-This is my property, Your Honor.
McLonergan.
Now, Mr. Lonergan, l understand you got stuck...
...with this here arid, gopher-infested property a couple of days ago.
How would you like to unload it for, say, a profit of 30 percent?
-lt's the McLonergan theory giving birth.
-What do you say? l couldn't consider any propositions for six months.
You see, l'm conducting certain experiments.
Now, let me ask you, sir, just what kind of experiments?
Well, you see, Father is a mineralogist from the old country.
He can make gold sprout out of the ground.
Gold? There ain't no gold in lreland. l myself discovered a vein our countrymen have been searching for...
...since the reign of Alfred the Thoughtless.
Who?
You never heard of Alfred the Thoughtless?
Well, he was King of Erin, following his father, Thomas the Temporary...
...who in turn was the only son of the virgin queen, Serena the Spotless.
Are you willing to sell this land or ain't you? l'm willing and l'm wanting, but l'm waiting. l'm sorry you said that. lt'll put me to the trouble...
...of issuing a writ of seizure on all this land.
-Here's the writ, senator.
-Now, don't be crude, Buzz. l hate to do this to you...
-...but you've been violating the law.
-Since when?
This afternoon. l just finished drafting this.
''Local ordinance number 7428.
Be it known that in the county of Rainbow Valley...
...it is a felony for members of the
Caucasian and Negro races--'' lt would seem to me that this law could not be a legal law.
Of course it's legal! l don't know where you immigrants get these foreign ideas.
From a book the immigration officer gave us.
-Called the United States Constitution.
-Haven't you read it? l don't have time to read it, l'm too busy defending it! l rest me case. l wish you folks would understand our traditions. l wish--
Now, don't get in the habit of making wishes on me property! lt's not your property. l'll thank you to get off it.
And take your black friends with you.
-l don't wanna go!
-Shush, Henry.
You're saying you're taking this land from these people because they're black?
-Don't let them chase us!
-Shut this kid up.
He's making me look like a bully.
Sheriff, get them out of here!
You heard the senator. You folks better start packing your things. ls Henry the wrong color?
No, of course not.
He's the right color.
But there's something wrong with the world.
-l wish--
-Sharon! Sharon!
There's something wrong with the world you've made for people like Henry! l wish you could know what that world is like. l wish to God you were black! l'm a son of a biscuit.
Oh, my God! What happened?
-Stonewall!
-Somebody get a doctor!
Father, what have l done?
You shouldn't go around me property making wishes.
Hey, sorry, buddy, but it's that great come-and-get-it day!
-What's going on?
-The senator tried to take our land away.
Then l lost me temper with him, and l shouted at him...
...and he turned black!
Don't worry. That happens every time he meets somebody he disagrees with.
He sees red, turns purple with rage and yells himself black in the face.
But we don't need to worry about him anymore.
We don't have to worry about anything anymore. We got good news!
-A telegram for Finian.
-For me?
-Let me see it!
-Oh, no.
This is a singing telegram.
''Dear sir, after investigating your standing in the community...
...and finding you to be a citizen of high character...
...we have taken the liberty of opening an unlimited charge account...
...for you and your associates.''
Signed,''Shears Robust Company.'' lt says,''P.S. We hear gold...
...has been discovered on your property. Congratulations!''
Gold?
-Must be a mistake here!
-Mistake?
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, what about this here?
Hey, come on, hurry up!
Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Didn't you hear the telegram?
We got credit! Wait!
Credit! Hold it, you're gonna dig up this whole valley. l've waited all my life for a break like this.
Yeah, but....
Don't you see, don't you know what credit means?
Credit means we can buy ourselves a tractor.
We can get ourselves a new planting machine, some tools...
...we can get laboratory equipment for Howard.
We can get our mentholated tobacco burning.
We're gonna make more money than you could get from digging up gold!
-He's right, you know.
-All right, Woody, when?
We want it now, Woody!
We want it right now.
Yeah. When?
When, Woody? When?
-When?
-Yeah, Woody. When?

Come-and-get-it day
When the idle poor
Become the idle rich
You'll never know just who is who
Or who is which
Won't it be rich
When everyone's poor relative
Becomes a Rockefellertive
And palms no longer itch?
What a switch!
When we all have ermine
And plastic teeth
How will we determine
Who's who underneath?
And when all your neighbors
Are upper class
You won't know your Joneses
From your...Astors
Let's toast the day
The day we drink that drinkie up
But with the little pinkie up
The day on which
The idle poor
Become the idle rich
When a rich man
Doesn't want to work
He's a bon vivant
Yes, he's a bon vivant
But when a poor man
Doesn't want to work
He's a loafer, he's a lounger
He's a lazy good-for-nothing
He's a jerk
When a rich man
Loses on a horse
Isn't he the sport, ho-ho!
Isn't he the sport?
But when a poor man
Loses on a horse
He's a gambler, he's a spender
He's a low-life, he's a reason for divorce
When a rich man chases after dames
He's a man about town
Oh, yes, a man about town
But when a poor man
Chases after dames
He's a bounder, he's rounder
He's a rotter and a lot of dirty names
When the idle poor
Become the idle rich
You'll never know just who is who
Or who is which
No one will see
The Irish or the Slav in you
For when you're on Park Avenue
Cornelius and Mike
Look alike
When poor Tweedledum
Is rich Tweedledee
This discrimination
Will no longer be
When we're in the dough
And off of the nut
You won't know your banker
From your...butler
Come on, Finian!
-Yay, Finian!
-Yeah, Finian!
Go, Finian!
Let's make the switch
With just a few annuities
We'll hide those incongruities
In cloaks from Abercrombie Fitch
-When the idle poor
-When the idle poor
-Become the idle rich
-Become the idle rich
When the idle poor
Become the idle...
...rich
What a mess!
Well, l'm busy.
You gotta clean this place up, man. lt's a firetrap. l wish....
Do you see that?
You think this--?
-Are you sure?
-l think....
Are you sure?!
-No.
-Let's try it, come on. l gotta admit something to you, Howard. l never really thought this day would come, you know.
Come on. lt burns! lt burns!
You did it, Howard.
You did it! You did it! lt burns! lt burns!
-lt's gone out. Here.
-No, no, no. Still burning. lt burns, Howard...
...but it doesn't smoke.
You're kidding me.
Woody, quick!
The sheriff is down by the brook!
Come on, you got lead in your pants?
Doesn't smoke?
What's going on here?
This is the DA, Woody.
You better talk respectful.
How does this concern you?
-This is my fiancée.
-Well, how nice. l'll ask you. What do you know about the whereabouts of Senator Rawkins?
Nothing, and neither does she.
There's 50 witnesses saw her do her mumbo jumbo.
And the split second she did,
Rawkins turned black, disappeared.
-That's crazy talk!
-Folks around here are getting nervous.
Could be dangerous.
You're supposed to keep law and order around here, not this white suit.
That's why we're conducting this preliminary investigation...
...on charge of witchcraft.
Witchcraft?
-You gotta be kidding.
-Concludes Tuesday.
By which day, Rawkins had better be produced in the flesh. l'm sorry, but we're gonna be busy on Tuesday.
-We're getting married.
-Don't count on that...
...or anything else if Rawkins isn't back.
Bye!
Oh, Woody, you're grandish.
You've made me deliriously happy.
Happy?
Trouble makes you happy? Come on.
No, you make me happy.
-You don't know why, do you?
-No, why?
Because you said it.
And you said it all by yourself.
You volunteered it without me, without magic, without me father...
-...twisting and tricking you into it.
-What'd l say?
That l'm your fiancée, which is to say...
...l'm your love. lt is grandish!
And we're gonna get married on Tuesday. lt's grandish.
Didn't know what l was saying.
Something came over me, like a spell come over me.
Hey, wait a minute, now. lt ain't true, is it?
Ain't what true?
About you being a witch.
Of course it's true.
Me and my glance
Make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To my razzle-dazzle
-Oh, you got me flyin' high and wide
-Yeah
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
I wanna cry, wanna croon
I wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon
In your eyes
Kiss me.
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little stream
Still a-ripplin' there?
Does the lassie
With the twinklin' eye
Go whistlin' by
And does she walk away
Sad and dreamy there
Not to see me there?
So I ask
Each weepin' willow
And each brook--
Give me that, boy!
You don't have to grab, mister.
There's plenty of apples around.
-Well, l don't see any.
-Because you're mortal!
You're mortal! Mortals can never see all the apples there are to be had.
An apple here. An apple there.
Little red apples everywhere.
You must be very hungry.
Would you like a sandwich?
Yeah.
Nice Virginia ham.
This is cheese! l ordered ham!
Forced to eat cheese.
-Forced to hide out like a hunted possum.
-Who are you hiding from?
My associates, my people, my dog...
...my whole way of life.
-l can't show myself like this.
-What's wrong with you?
Are you blind, boy?
Can't you see l'm black? l think it's very becoming.
Well, it isn't! l'm a white man, damn it! l'm a white man!
At least l was until a couple of days ago.
Well, that's a coincidence. l was green a couple of weeks ago!
Don't you find the change of color interesting?
No, l don't!
And they won't get away with it.
They won't get away with it!
Don't have to get so excited. l think it's just ridiculous making such a fuss about a person's color.
Well, you don't realize what it's like being black here.
But you're human!
A rose is a rose is a rose
Despite the color of your nose
You don't understand, boy.
-You're nothing when you're black!
-Nothing? Who says so?
-The law says.
-Well, it's a silly law.
But is it a legal law?
Of course it's legal. l wrote it myself!
-Change it back.
-How am l gonna do that?
-You said you had it changed days ago.
-l said no such thing.
-Some witch wished it on me.
-A witch! A witch!
-l can help you. What sort of a witch?
-l didn't look her up in Who's Who!
She's bound to be in Which Is Witch. lt lists their curses and cures--
Boy, go away, will you! l see your trouble now, mister.
You're too unfriendly. l'm in no condition for friendship!
That witch's fault!
She gave you a new outside...
...and she should've given you a new inside.
-That's very incompetent.
-Will you go away!
This will give witchcraft a bad name. lt'll set the entire profession back 100 years. l'll have to do something about it.
Me reputation's at stake. l'll have to alter your personality.
Stand up, please.
-Why don't you leave me alone.
-This won't be too hard.
All we have to do is to broaden out that narrow mind a little...
...reduce some of that bigotry...
...and your pomposity won't show through at all.
Wait till they see you in your new spring psyche.
People will say you're in love.
Now....
Fiddle, foddle
Foil and fiddle
Cure this fuddled individual
Whirl, ye waters, and unwind
This tangled, medieval mind
Breath of bee and bluebird's wing
Make this scowling spirit sing
Balm of briar, sandalwood
Season him with brotherhood
Magic vapors, make this person
A better person
Not a worse one
He sleeps!
The cure is beginning to work!
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Golden slippers I laid away
Can't touch'em till my wedding day
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Golden slippers I laid away
Until my wedding day, oh!
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Oh--
Brother!
Brother, you're the voice in the wilderness.
Allow me the honor of shaking your hand.
Well, thank you, friend. lt's nice to be able to talk to somebody again.
Just whom, may l ask, do we have the unexpected pleasure of meeting up with?
Just call me Bill.
You folks from around here?
-We're from around everywhere.
-Yeah. We travel and we sing.
Haven't you ever heard of the Passion Pilgrim Gospeleers? l've been out of touch with the gospel recently.
We're the prize-winningest,
Gospel-singingest quartet...
...east of the Rockies!
Quartet? Why, there's only three of you.
Well, you see, brother, we suffered a casualty last night.
Yes, there was our number-four man,
Russ, suddenly taken with temptation.
And in desperation, he cries out:
-''Get thee behind me, Satan!''
-And Satan got--
-Satan pushed--
-He pushed him--
Right into the arms of a bouncing
Babylonian Jezebel...
-...from Biloxi, Mississippi.
-Oh, the soul was strong...
...but the flesh was weak.
And that's why divine providence led us to you.
You may be Bill...
...but that voice inside you is Russ. l wouldn't be a bit surprised. l had a lot of shuffling around lately.
Well, your shuffling days are over.
With your voice, we can go right on being a prize-winning quartet.
-l can make a living singing with you?
-There's a handful of ways.
Either tote that barge.
-Lift that bale.
-Shine that shoe.
-Or sing.
-We sing.
But before we do, somebody's either gotta get buried or get married.
Over in Rainbow Valley, there's a couple just aching to be spliced.
And a $20 bill just aching to be split.
Will you join us?
Brothers, you are now a quartet!
Well, good!
Now, in preparation for this ceremony...
...we take our text from Genesis, wherein it says:
Adam and Eve begat Cain and Abel.
From thence on, the history of the world is just the history of who begat who.
-Well, what do l sing in that?
-You carry the big theme of this song.
You stress the word''begat'' and keep stressing it.
Can you remember that? l got it!
-I got it
-I got it
I got it
We got it
The Lord made Adam
The Lord made Eve
He made them both
A little bit naive
They lived as free as a summer breeze
Without pajamas and without chemise
Until they stumbled on the apple trees
Then she looked at him
And he looked at her
And they knew immediately
What the world was fer
He said,''Give me my cane''
He said,''Give me my hat''
The time has come
To begin the begat
The begat
The begat
So they begat Cain
And they begat Abel
Who begat the rabble
At the tower of Babel
-They begat the Cohens
-They begat O'Rourkes
And they begat the people
Who believed in storks
Lordy, Lordy
How they did begat
-How they be-be-begat
-Even more than that
When the begat
Got to gettin' under par
They begat the daughters
Of the D.A.R
They begat the Babbitts
Of the bourgeoisie
Who begat the misbegotten VIPs
They begat
They begat
It was pleasin' to Jezebel
Pleasin' to Ruth
It pleased
the League of Women Shoppers In Duluth
Though the movie censors
Tried the facts to hide
The moviegoers up and multiplied
Lordy, Lordy
How they multiplied!
-How they multiplied
-How they multiplied
-Soon it swept the world
-Every land and lingo
-It became the rage
-It was bigger than bingo
The white begat, the red begat
The folks
Who shoulda stood in bed begat
The Greeks begat
The Swedes begat
Why, even Britishers in tweed begat
And Lordy, Lordy
What the seeds begat!
-The Lats and Lithuanians
-Begat
-Scranton, Pennsylvanians
-Begat
-Strict vegetarians
-Begat
-Honorary Aryans
-Begat
-Startin' from Genesis
-We begat
-Heroes and menaces
-Begat
-Fat filibusterers
-Begat
-Income tax adjusterers
-Begat
-'Twas naturaler and naturaler
-To begat
-And sometimes the bachelor
-He begat
It didn't matter which-a-ways
They begat
Sons of habitués
Begat
-So begats them all
-So bless them all!
-Who go to bat
-Who go to bat
And heed the call
Of the begat
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
'Twas a sumptuous gift
To bequeath to a child
For the lure of that song
Keeps my head runnin' wild
So I searched all the earth
And I scanned all the skies
And I found it at last
In my own true love's eyes
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today--
Stand back, everybody!
-Don't want any trouble.
-Just what do you want?
Miss Sharon McLonergan.
Mrs. Sharon Mahoney in a few minutes, if you don't mind.
Dearly beloved...
...we are gathered here today to join this man and this woman--
No, no, no, no, no, no!
-l got a warrant for your arrest.
-On what charge?
The People v. Miss Sharon McLonergan.
-The charge is demoting!
-''Demoting''?
Demoting a member of the white race,
Senator Rawkins...
-...down to a member of the Negro race.
-By means of witchcraft.
There's a law against witchcraft in this state.
Yes, l know. lt was passed in 1690! l think it's about time we repealed that law. Right now!
Yeah!
Hold it! Hold it, l said!
Arrest that witch.
All right, Bill.
-Do your duty.
-Sure thing.
All right, come and get me, then!
Arrest her, Sam! Arrest her!
-Arrest her, Sam.
-Well, l'm only a second deputy.
-You're the first.
-Sheriff, quit stalling. Arrest her!
Turn them into pumpkins, Sharon.
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
Don't you try any hocus-pocus.
You can't goofer us now.
That there's lizard dust.
Lizard dust?
Witchcraft?
-You don't really believe l'm a witch?
-Arrest her!
Wait a minute, now.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, don't let her bedevil you.
A witch she is, and a witch she's always been.
Finian....
-He doesn't know what he's saying.
-Oh, yes, l do.
By the age of 10, she'd already developed her uncanny powers...
...and was changing me good whiskey into milk. lt was a crisis!
From then on, one change led to another...
...and now you're witnesses to this unhappy climax.
-She's changed a white man into a black.
-Let me talk to you.
Leave me alone. l'm doing the right thing.
All right, let's go.
Wait a minute!
You know, being a witch, she can also change a black man into a white.
She can make Rawkins white again?
-Or any color that Your Honor pleases.
-All right!
Turn him into a white man now.
-Just a minute! l got something to say.
-By God!
-Senator Rawkins.
-Calm yourself, senator.
You're in no position to have opinions right now.
Who's in a better position? Boy, can l see both sides of this question!
How much time will she need?
Well, for a bit of a thing like that, l would say until the crack of dawn. l will not be used as evidence...
-...in any witchcraft trial!
-Yeah!
Take him, boys! He's Exhibit A!
Her too!
Now, now, now...
...for your own safety's sake...
...if l were you, l wouldn't be trying to move her or him.
All right.
The crack of dawn...
...or it'll be the crack of doom, you hear?
Sheriff, move them all out but these two.
Clear everybody out!
Come on! Move!
Sit down!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute! Wait a....
-Sit down.
-Get out of here, boy!
Get that boy out of here!
The crock's in the ground, and all's well with the world. lt's gone! lt's gone. lt's not here.
Leprechaun! Og!
Nemesis! Og!
Og!
Sharon!
Sharon McLonergan!
Sharon?
Sharon.
Look at me, Sharon. l'm 90 percent mortal now.
And 100 percent miserable. lt's a frenzy, a frenzy.
And the only cure for it is you.
Sharon? l feel better already just being near you.
The scent of your hair...
...the touch of your hand.
Oh, the miracle of it, the miracle of it, the sweet, sweet miracle of it.
She loves me.
Her hand fits me cheek.
Oh, Sharon, you're the only one, the only one!
You're not Sharon at all.
You're Susan the Silent.
Yet l still feel the same frenzy for you. ls this what it's like to be mortal? ls every girl the only girl? l'm beginning to like it.
Oh, my heart is beating wildly
And it's all because you're here
When I'm not near
The girl I love
I love the girl I'm near
Every femme that flutters by me
Is a flame that must be fanned
When I can't fondle
The hand I'm fond of
I fondle the hand at hand
My heart's in a pickle
It's constantly fickle
And not too''partickle,'' I fear
When I'm not near
The girl I love
I love the girl I'm near
Sharon! l mean, Susan.
Susan!
What if they're tall and tender?
What if they're small and slender?
Long as they've got that gender
I surrender
Always I can't refuse'em
Always my feet pursues'em
Long as they got a bosom
I woos'em
I love the girl I'm near
When I'm not near
The girl I love
I love the girl I'm near
I'm confessin' a confession
And I hope I'm not verbose
When I'm not close to
The kiss that I cling to
I cling to the kiss that's close
As I'm more and more a mortal
I am more and more a case
When I'm not facing
The face that I fancy
I fancy the face I face
For Sharon I'm carin'
But Susan I'm choosin'
I'm faithful to whos'n is here
When I'm not near
The girl I love
I love the girl...
...I'm near
So there you are!
The wrath of Ozymandias on you!
From dusk to sunup, l've searched forest and hill...
...and l find you philandering with a woman in your arms.
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong!
At a moment like this?
-Have you forgotten me daughter?
-l have not!
She's the woman l love...
...present company excepted.
The shamrock of her eyes, and her voice like the bells of St. Mary's....
-Has anything happened?
-lndeed, it has.
This is her last sunrise.
Twenty minutes from now, at dawn...
... the glory that was Sharon...
...and the boy that was her beloved will perish in smoke and flame. l told you the gold brings doom and gloom.
Gloom and doom!
Don't blame the gold!
You're the culprit!
-l?
-Aye. lf you weren't a leprechaun...
...you'd have had no gold. lf you had none, l wouldn't have borrowed it. l wouldn't have come, and me daughter wouldn't be burned for witchcraft! lt's my fault. lt's all my fault.
Oh, the merciful saints forgive me.
Her broken father will forgive you too, if you'd just spare a little magic for her.
Oh, anything, Mr. McLonergan.
I'd do anything!
Turn the senator white again
and save Sharon's life!
Og, we've only 20 minutes!
Well, Sambo.
You don't look like you lightened up a smidgen. l could do it in a minute and have 19 left.
Thank heavens. l knew you wouldn't fail me.
Why not wait 19 minutes...
...and leave it all to the last minute. lt's more dramatic.
Now, Og, now!
-lt's a matter of life and death!
-Very well, Mr. McLonergan.
-l just need one thing from you.
-What is it?
-Speak up, man. What do you need?
-A crock of gold.
Give me strength to resist me own strength to keep from choking him!
You stand there and pretend you haven't got it?
-But l haven't got it!
-Then why can't l find it? l dug more holes this weary night than all the gophers in Christendom!
Think back to when you buried it.
What were you doing? l don't know! How would l know? l.... l had a jug of whiskey in one hand and the crock of gold in the other--
You might've buried the jug and swallowed the crock.
You Machiavellian, half-pint pirate, stealing me property! l want it back.
-Please, Mr. McLonergan, l wish l had it.
-Where is it?
-l haven't got it.
-l'll throttle it out of you! l want it back!
Where is it? Where is it?
You perfidious little wretch....
-l'll throttle it out of you.
-l don't know where it is!
Where is it? l wish l....
-Where is it?
-l wish l.... lt's almost dawn.
They can't do it to her.
It'll be one of me or 100 of them!
Og...
...if you have a mite of merciful magic left, help me save me daughter's life.
Will you, now?
Oh, Susan, it's a crisis.
A crisis.
They're gonna burn Sharon for a witch.
She's not a witch.
She must've been standing by the crock when she made the wish.
Susan...
...you must've been there.
Where was Sharon standing?
Where was she...?
Oh, it's no good asking you.
You can't hear me. l'll have to ask somebody else.
There's no time.
Susan, come here.
Sit down. Look...
...l'll dance you the questions, and you dance me the answers, you see?
Questions, answers, right? l'll put it another way.
Susan, Susan, Susan....
You're a darling girl...
...and l love you very much...
...but l just wish to God you could talk. l love you. l love you.
Beautiful new words.
Will you say them again? l love you.
She loves me.
She loves me!
You're talking, Susan!
Where was Sharon standing?
-l love you!
-Oh, l know that.
But you're talking.
That means l must've wished you into it.
Which means l must've been standing over the crock.
The crock, the crock.... lt looks like you are permanently a black man.
Oh, my heavens.
What have l done?
The crock.
There's only one wish left.
The last one. lf l use it to wish the senator white...
...l'd never be a leprechaun again.
-We gotta sound the alarm.
-Yes.
Mr. Rodgers, sound the alarm.
Fire.
Fire.
Fire.
But l don't wanna be mortal. l wanna go back to fairyland.
Fairyland was never like this.
Where is she?
Rawkins, you blackguard, l wish you white!
-She turned him white.
-He's done it!
Thank you, Og.
Release those prisoners!
Come on! Keep that water coming in here!
-Keep the water coming!
-Keep the water coming.
-Keep the water coming!
-Keep the water coming!
-Keep the water coming!
-Susan is talking!
-Susan's talking!
-Susan's talking!
-Susan's talking.
-Susan's talking.
-Susan's talking.
-Susan's talking.
Susan....
Susan's talking?
Woody!
-Susan's talking!
-What?
-Susan's talking!
-ls it true?
Well, say something, will you? l've been waiting 20 years! lsn't it grandish, Woody?
You used the crock to wish back
Susan's tongue.
-Aye.
-And you used up the last wish.
And now the crock has turned to worthless dross.
Aye. Right, Mr. McLonergan.
Dross, worthless dross.
Hey, Woody! Over here!
The lab's going!
Four years of sweat and work, and it's all going up in smoke. lt's all right, Howard. We'll put it out.
No! No! lt's smoking!
Homegrown mentholated smoke!
I searched all the earth
And I scanned all the skies
And I found it at last
In my own true love's eyes
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over the hill and stream
Look, look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream l now pronounce you...
...man and wife.
Father...
...are you leaving us?
Aye. l've had Fort Knox. l see.
Things are indeed hopeless.
Hopeless...
...but they're not serious.
But where are you going?
To find me a rainbow...
...Finian's Rainbow. lt never fails to come up when a McLonergan is down.
Sure, there may not be a pot of gold at the end of it...
...but there's a beautiful new world under it.
Make it shine on Sharon.
Goodbye, me darling.
Goodbye, me friends. l'll see you all in Glocca Morra.
Sharon, where is Glocca Morra?
Well, you see, it's always somewhere...
...over there.
So to every weepin' willow
To each brook along the way
To each lad who comes a-whistlin'
''Too-ra-lay''
May we meet in Glocca Morra
Some fine day
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook
Still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny Cove
Through Killybegs,
Kilkerry and Kildaire?
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that willow tree
Still weeping there?
Does that laddie
With the twinkling eye
Come whistling by
And does he walk away
Sad and dreamy there
Not to see me there?
So I'll ask each weeping willow
And each brook along the way
And each lad
That comes a-whistlin'
''Too-ra-lay''
''How are things in Glocca Morra...
... this fine day?''

- Hard eight.
Here we go. Coming out.

Come on, roll.
Here they go. We gotta roll.
Coming on out. There they go.
Mr. Swanson! Mr. Swanson!
Mr. Swanson, Lucky's got the dough!
- He's got it!
- Great.
It's like a miracle.
A dream coming true.
Good. Lucky always wanted to race for himself.
He's supposed to meet me back here in Los Angeles. Let's get it crated.
Not so fast now.
Lucky's your friend and partner...
...but I'm a plain, ordinary businessman.
Until he shows up with the dough that motor stays here.
But he's got the dough!
Look, Shorty. I can't deposit this in my bank. It's the wrong color.
Hey, Swanny.
- That motor still for sale?
- Yes, Mr. Olson.
It's the last one I've got.
But you can't. Lucky's gonna buy it.
I told you, first guy walks in here with the dough buys the motor.
- Who's the wild-eyed one?
- Lucky Jackson's mechanic.
I may be interested in the motor as a spare.
I'm entering two cars in the Las Vegas Grand Prix.
Operator. Operator!
Get me Las Vegas. Quick!
- Hey, you got room for me?
- Sure, drive right in.
Hey, boss. Here comes Lucky Jackson with his entry.
All right, back her right in here.
Here we go. Bring it around a little.
That's quite a rig.
- I never saw anything like it.
- One of a kind. Built it myself.
- What'll she do?
- I don't know yet.
I'm on my way to Los Angeles to pick up my motor.
- Be back tomorrow.
- Fine.
- I'd like to pay in advance.
- All right.
Thank you.
Well, what do you think of it,
Mr. Lucky Jackson?
Well, Elmo Mancini.
The Italian racing count.
How do you know me?
I went three times to watch you drive at the Western Speedway.
- You're brilliant.
- Thanks, coming from the champion.
In Europe. Now I would like to prove myself in your country.
Too bad you're going back to L.A.
I had a proposition to make to you.
- To me?
- Yes.
I admire the bravado with which you drive...
...and I want you to drive for me.
- You're not driving in the Grand Prix?
- No, no.
I mean, I intend to win.
Now I get it.
You'll use my "bravado" to block for you so you can get through.
I knew you were clever.
A couple things wrong with your proposition:
I don't work for anybody.
I never run second to anybody.
And one small thing:
I intend to win.
You think you can beat both of us?
I'll try.
I'd like to see what you got.
Be my guest.
- You have made some changes.
- I got my little secrets.
Yeah, I can tell.
Can you help me, please?
Can we help you? Yes, ma'am.
I'd like you to check my motor.
It whistles.
I don't blame it.
- What did you say?
- Forgive my friend. He's very young.
We'll be very happy to check your motor.
That's what I call a real sporty model.
I agree. A beautiful line.
- Count?
- Oh, yes.
That's how I started out, working on sports cars.
- Well, no wonder!
- Well, is it serious?
She got a lucky break when she stopped in here.
Oh, yes.
- Start her up, champ.
- Yeah.
Let her rip!
- I don't understand...
- I'll make it simple.
- Your motor's broken.
- Broke?
It was running perfectly when I pulled up here, except for the whistle.
- Are you sure you're a mechanic?
- Sure I am.
We're gonna have to dismantle this whole thing.
Completely.
- Might take a whole day.
- A day?
Maybe two.
Well, if you have to.
Can you lend me a car until you have mine running again?
We'll do better. I'll be happy to drive you wherever you want to go.
And why should you go to all that bother?
Because here I'm known as
"your very bothering mechanic."
I'm sure you are.
Be right back.
I'm sorry.
You fixed it.
- You know what you've done?
- What?
We don't even know the girl's name.
Or do you?
- You could've seen her registration.
- I had no eyes for her registration.
- My eyes were...
- I know what they were on.
She might not even live here.
She could be a tourist.
Trust my instinct in these matters.
She could be in one of the shows.
But what difference does it make?
Unfortunately, you're on your way to L.A. and I have to work on my car.
Therefore, we have no time to search for a beautiful girl.
I guess you're right.
- Good luck to you.
- Good luck to you too.
I thought you were on your way to Los Angeles.
The same way you were gonna work on your motor. Remember?
Did you find her?
I haven't checked them all yet.
We'll find her if it takes all night.
- Shall we go in?
- Might as well.
"Welcome Sons of the Lone Star State."
Looks like they're having a good time.
What happened here?
- Boss, I've done the best...
- I know!
Go get yourself a drink! Or 10!
- Do you have a girl about so high?
- With legs incomparable?
I don't know what kind of girls I got, but troubles, I got plenty!
When is the next show?
There isn't gonna be any show until I get these crazy Sons...
Until I get them out of here!
You get the girls ready to go on in 5 minutes. Count.
Fellow Texans!
Sons of the glorious Lone Star State.
Let's pay tribute to those who've made Texas...
...the most glorious and proud state of the union.
To the memory of noble Sam Houston!
To the one and only Davy Crockett!
John Wayne.
Bring out the girls.
Come to think of it, we never had a girl that high, legs incomparable...
...but we got a gorgeous line of Korean cuties.
"Trust my instincts in these matters."
I trusted your instinct.
Where did it get me? Nowhere.
To Texas.
It's not the end of the world.
Tonight is another night.
Tonight I'll be on my way back to Los Angeles.
All right. Now, everybody line up.
Watch me.
Be sure you pay strict attention.
Watch me very closely.
Now, watch me.
Spread...
...step, step...
...swan...
...and push.
Count...
...I'm going to L.A. right now.
Can I borrow this?
You're going to take the guitar all the way back to Los Angeles?
What for?
All right, let's try it. Get ready.
All right.
Come on. Don't be afraid.
Come on. Right out there.
Go! Go! Good.
Arms spread. Go ahead.
Very good!
There you go. All the way back.
That's right.
Good. Here come the winners.
Good for you.
Good morning.
I've been looking for you all night.
Really? You must be desperate to find a motor that needs fixing.
What I really need is a swimming lesson.
I'm through with lessons today.
- Great. Why don't we go out?
- I have other duties.
She loves me
She loves not
She loves me, she loves me
She loves me
The lady loves me
And it shows
In spite of the way
She turns up her nose
I'm her ideal
Her heart's desire
Under that ice
She's burning like fire
She'd like to cuddle up to me
She's playing hard to get
The lady loves me
But she doesn't know it yet
The gentlemen has savoir faire
As much as an elephant
Or a bear
I'd like to take him for a spin
Back to the zoo
To visit his kin
He's got about as much appeal
As a soggy cigarette
The lady loathes him
But he doesn't know it yet
The lady's got a crush on me
The gentlemen's crazy
Obviously
The lady's dying to be kissed
The gentlemen needs a psychiatrist
I'd rather kiss a rattlesnake
Or play Russian roulette
The lady loves me
But she doesn't know it yet
She's falling fast
She's on the skids
Both of his heads
Are flipping their lids
Tonight she'll hold me in her arms
I'd rather be holding hydrogen bombs
Will someone tell this Romeo
I'm not his Juliet
The lady loves me
But she doesn't know it yet
- She wants me
- Like poison ivy
- Needs me
- Like a hole in the head
- Anyone can see she's got it bad
- He's mad
- The gentleman is an egotist
- I'm simply aware I'm hard to resist
- He's one man I could learn to hate
- How's about having dinner at 8?
I'd rather dine with a Frankenstein
In a moonlight tete-a-tete
The lady loves me
But she doesn't know it yet
Oh, yes, she loves me
Dig that shrinking violet
- Oh, she really loves me
- Here's one gal you'll never get
She love, love, loves me
Would you like to make a bet?
I said the lady loves me
The gentleman's all wet
- You're using the wrong technique.
- No kidding.
Mr. Jackson?
- May I have a word with you, please?
- Sure.
What's the word?
The word, Mr. Jackson, is money.
You arrived with no luggage and you charged...
- Hey, Lucky! Hey, partner!
- What're you doing here?
Didn't you get my message?
Swanson will sell the motor unless we get him the money.
We're leaving now. Give me the bill.
- You fall in the pool or something?
- Long story.
Maybe you got it stashed in the room?
Some dame roll you?
Don't ponic pan... panic, partner.
I'll help you.
- It's no use. The money's gone.
- It is?
That's very good.
Good, Jimmy. Good, good, good.
Good. All right, that's enough.
You can join the others.
Very good.
- I was watching you teach. Very good.
- Thank you.
I've ordered lunch for us.
Will you join me?
Thank you so much, but I'm on duty right now.
Too bad.
What's this?
Some kind of American joke?
No, it's not. He lost all our money.
That's not a tragedy, my friend.
Now you can drive for me.
Looks like we got a job here for a long, long time, Count.
Serve him, Shorty.
Ma'am, would you like a lemonade on the house?
I heard about your money.
I'm so sorry.
- It's only money.
- Only money?
Do you know how hard it is to earn money?
- But I won it.
- Not win it, but make it.
Well, now that you've got me told, how would you like to go out with me?
I'm a working girl.
Not tomorrow. I checked already.
I'm on the shift that gets off too.
And I got a whole day to spend with you. So?
So all right.
- Meet me at the University of Nevada.
- You must be kidding.
What're they teaching you? How to stack cards and deal from the bottom?
Rusty, I thought maybe we could go dancing or something.
- Oh, you want to go dancing?
- Or something.
- Are you a good dancer?
- Try me.
That I will.
Meet me at the university gymnasium tomorrow morning at 9:00...
...and we'll dance.
Or something.
Okay, kids, relax.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Do you want to join us?
If I'm caught, they'll take my license.
- You wanted to dance.
- Not here.
- Are you gonna chicken out?
- Yeah.
- Let's cut out of here.
- On one condition.
The kids are expecting you to do something.
So if you don't want to dance, sing.
I know you can do that.
- Okay, but then we cut out, right?
- Right.
- This is fun.
- It's the only way to travel.
That's Hoover Dam.
One of the seven modern civil engineering wonders of this century.
It's over 700 feet from the Colorado River below to the top of the dam.
The dam helps make enough electricity to light up homes 300 miles away.
Fly with Rusty Martin and complete your education.
I do sound like a guide.
Where are we going?
That way.
That's Lake Mead behind the dam.
Do you see it?
Continue, professor.
All right. The lake has
550 miles of shoreline...
...and that's the marina there ahead of us.
And there you can go sailing, boating, fishing...
...swimming, water-skiing...
You said the magic word.
- I did?
- Yeah. Hang on, here we go.
- Where are you from, Rusty?
- Dubuque.
I've never been, but it's interesting that you're from there.
Before you get too attached to Dubuque, we moved there from Chillicothe, Ohio.
How about that.
I've never been there either.
Don't fall in love with Chillicothe.
Before that we lived in Helena,
Arkansas. On the Mississippi.
The Mississippi.
A great place to be born.
I wasn't.
I was born here in Las Vegas.
- You're putting me on?
- No.
- That's a coincidence.
- What?
You were born here, and after all that traveling I met you here.
It must mean something.
All it means is my father came here to work on the dam...
...and he liked it and he stayed.
We live right over here.
I sort of remember Las Vegas was nothing much then.
A place where people came to get married.
Came to get married.
Still do I guess.
I suppose. It's a thing
I'm not very much interested in.
Me neither. I guess you got big plans for your future, haven't you?
You'll probably find it very dull and commonplace...
...but I want to earn enough to help my father buy a boat.
- A boat?
- Yes.
He runs a sightseeing boat on the lake now.
My father's the kind of a man who doesn't like to work for other people.
He wants to work for himself.
He's never had a chance to because of taking care of me.
For a long time it's been my father and me.
He's the kind of man who likes to work for himself.
Sort of like me.
He's entirely different.
He's actually more like me...
...not crazy at all.
- Thank you.
- Honey?
- Dad.
- Can't I be a little bit crazy?
- Hi, Dad.
- Lucky, this is my father.
- Mr. Martin.
- Rusty's talked a lot about you.
- She has?
- I didn't think she'd mention me.
- I mentioned your losing your money.
Had a good day?
- Great. We...
- We went sightseeing.
- The usual things, you know.
- Yeah, sure.
You kids remember to eat lunch?
You didn't.
Come inside the apartment.
We'll throw something together.
Thanks, but I better get the copter back.
You kids come in a copter?
Don't they cost 10 dollars a minute?
The guy running the field is an Air Force buddy.
He still lets me order him around.
Well, I'd like to hear what you have to say about race driving.
Come to think of it, if I were younger, I'd take it up myself.
Father!
Take it up with your daughter.
She don't think it's safe.
Well, honey, I'll run along.
I promised old Jake Stiles I'd go bowling.
Father, stop torturing me.
I couldn't eat a thing.
- I never had a better day.
- Me too.
Let's don't let it end.
I'll go change.
I give
Give you my heart
Today, tomorrow and forever
You'll always be my love
I give
Give you my heart
Today, tomorrow and forever
You'll always be my love
You'll always be
My love
- Hello, Rusty.
- Pretty car. I love the color.
Thank you.
- You enjoy racing?
- I don't really know.
- I suppose you're very good.
- Well, I hope I am.
Is Lucky good?
He's the best since Cal Howard.
Cal Howard? Is he the champion?
He would have been, but he had bad luck.
- What do you mean?
- His car crashed over a wall.
So, as you see, the good thing to do is to avoid bad luck.
I guess so.
- What are you talking about?
- Rusty was asking...
We were just discussing cars and drivers.
- Let's go for a ride.
- You got the motor?
You better believe it.
You do?
This way.
Okay, now I'm gonna downshift and bring her up 5700 revs.
- What does that mean?
- We're going into a turn.
Hey, okay.
Here's my shift point.
Watch me burn up the guy ahead.
- Why?
- Because we gotta win, that's why.
Just a few more hundred of these and I'll be racing again.
Someday.
Someday you'll get smashed up just like Cal Howard.
How did you know about that?
Oh, look. He was just unlucky, that's all.
- It's just one of those things.
- Unlucky. That's what everybody says.
Honey, I just don't understand this part of you. I really don't.
What do you mean "this part of me"?
It is me.
Try to understand, it is me.
Then you've got to understand me.
When I get married...
...I want a little white house...
...with a tree in the front yard.
A real kind of tree...
...with green leaves...
Oh, that.
When I get the money, we can have 100 trees...
...a big white house with a four-car garage and everything.
- By then I'll be the champ.
- I don't want you to be champ.
I know that every cent you get your hands on...
...you'll gamble away, because it's that motor you want.
The Grand Prix. Any race.
Any fool would know...
...you won't change.
Not for anybody.
Well, what are you doing home this time of day, honey?
- You feel all right?
- I never felt better in my life.
Oh, sure. Of course. I can see that.
Is it so unusual for a girl to come home...
...because she's sick of the hotel and all the people in it?
Is it so unusual for a girl to want a little peace and quiet?
You answer it and if it's anybody,
I won't speak to him.
- Yeah?
- For Miss Rusty Martin.
- A tree?
- Yeah, a tree.
- You want that I put it inside?
- No, you better not.
It's pretty outdoorsy.
Thanks.
- Come here.
- I'm not interested.
It's not that anybody you didn't want to see.
It's something he sent you.
A little posy.
It should be obvious
I'm completely indifferent...
...to anything he might give...
It's a tree. Daddy, it's a tree!
It sure is.
Oh, I've wronged him.
- I've wronged him terribly.
- Sure you have.
The things I said, what I did.
I'm so sorry.
All I could do is say so.
From the bottom of my heart.
You know, Mr. Tree...
...we may have a big celebration come Christmas.
You and I can both get lit up.
Lucky! Lucky!
Oh, I'm sorry. It's not you.
Rusty!
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, Rusty.
If you're free, why don't we have a quiet dinner in my suite?
No, I couldn't. Not after the tree.
Tree?
- What are you doing?
- Hi, Lucky, baby.
You're supposed to be working.
I'm not a waiter anymore, and neither are you.
The Italian champ couldn't stand us being waiters...
...so he paid off our debt to this joint. We're free.
You must be out of your mind.
We don't want to...
Help yourself, ladies.
Lucky, I've got to talk to you.
Stop helping.
Mind your own business.
What are you talking about?
I know. Even if you win, it won't be enough for a motor.
With a cash prize,
I could win enough for it.
You can take your darn tree back!
Tree again? What's this tree?
- I need a tree like a...
- Hold on!
You can't do that!
Look, Rusty, I could use the money
I'm going to win.
Win? What makes you so sure you're going to win?
- I'm in the contest too.
- Go ahead. Try to win. I don't care.
- That's exactly what I'm going to do.
- That's fine.
- I hope you lose!
- Thanks!
See what you started?
- Didn't you ask me to dinner?
- Yes, of course.
All right!
- Francois!
- Yes, maitre.
You'll serve Count Mancini in his suite, as you know.
And discreetly.
Discreetly.
When you have finished serving, vanish.
Because at this moment, musicians take their places behind the screen...
...and romantic Italian melodies provide an atmosphere of...
You see, the count is dining a deux with the beautiful...
...manager of our pool.
Hey, Frankie. Frankie.
Can you be bought?
You look lovely tonight.
Thank you.
They're beautiful.
Just beautiful.
I've never had a whole spray before.
Thank you.
I've always seen your hair in bright sunlight.
I thought it was the loveliest thing
I'd seen.
But by candlelight it's softer.
Even more beautiful.
- Yes, now back to our conversation.
- Conversation?
That we had today.
About the racing and drivers?
Yes, our conversation,
Let's talk about you first.
- Good evening, folks.
- Oh, no.
Thought you'd like something to gnaw.
Potato chips and champagne don't go together.
Count, they're my favorite.
These candles smell funny.
You don't need them.
It's bright outside.
Yes, now, what we were talking about.
- Why do you drive in the Grand Prix?
- I want to win.
- It's my first U.S. Race.
- I don't understand...
Don't try to explain to her because she won't understand.
You won't understand, will you, baby?
- Don't call me baby.
- Okay, baby.
Should I open the count, pop?
Pop, count?
- If you know how.
- There's a first for everything.
You had champagne?
Certainly, hundreds of times.
When my friend Pauline got married...
...and when I was 18 my father and I split a split.
You were asking why I race?
It is because racing cars have always been my hobby.
I'm a wealthy man and have nothing to spend my money on that matters.
Oh, that's sad.
But if I met a girl I could love,
I'd gladly give up my hobby.
Keep my cars as toys.
Let Lucky drive them.
He's a very fine driver.
But a miserable waiter.
Soup.
You'd give up racing?
For the girl I love? Oh, yes.
We haven't finished.
It was cold when it spilled on my hand. It's bad.
Somebody I know wouldn't give up racing. For a girl or for anything.
- I like how you think.
- Thank you.
It sounds very attractive and so reasonable.
This catfish don't look too healthy.
It's furry around the edges.
Bring us another order then.
If you're gonna get her primed,
I better open this.
- How dare you!
- I gotta open it.
I feel it in my heart, Rusty.
There's a time in life when a man must put away his toys...
...and get on to the serious business of living.
Definitely.
I agree with you thoroughly.
It's a pleasure to hear a man's opinion...
...and not have to listen to a stubborn boy who won't grow up...
That's too much.
Where's my regular waiter?
You don't want me?
No. Anybody but you.
Okay. Take it easy with the pop because I want you in top shape...
...when you lose that talent contest.
Leave it alone.
Just get out.
Okay, I'm going. I'm going.
Bye.
Oh, no. Get out.
Just get out. Leave it.
- Get out.
- Come on. He wants to be alone.
I'm sorry. I didn't expect our dinner to turn into a farce.
That's all right.
- Music for you.
- It's beautiful.
Just beautiful.
Now I feel at home again.
I can almost believe we are in my villa...
...outside of Naples.
It lies up in the hills.
The air is so soft.
- It warms a man's blood.
- It's air-conditioned here.
Flowers tumble over the wall.
Everything's in bloom.
You mustn't judge all America by Las Vegas...
...because Las Vegas is in the desert and it's the summertime now.
If you think I don't need you
Take a look at my eyes
Baby, these ain't raindrops
Falling out of the sky
Since you've been gone
I've been so alone
If you think I don't need you
Then, baby, you're wrong
If you think I don't love you
What could I do
To prove to you, baby
My love is true
I sing the same old song
Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
I've been so alone
If you think I don't need you
Baby you're wrong
I hate to break this up, but we'll be late for the contest, baby.
- Don't call me...
- Baby.
Do you understand what I tried to say?
What you tried to say sounds attractive.
Thank you. Good luck in the contest.
I think I need it.
I was just... Yeah.
Wonderful.
You know our chef, Karl, and his lovely wife...
...who will be appearing in the kitchen to pay for the broken dishes.
Here's a real treat, fellow employees.
A lady who comes to us direct from a sensational run...
...around our swimming pool.
Our very clever pool manager...
...let's make her welcome.
Lovely Rusty Martin.
Let's bring Rusty out.
We're really way up there!
Looks like you're the winner so far.
And now, fellow employees...
...here is America's foremost waiter, but he may be tomorrow's maitre d'.
Let's welcome from amongst you...
...Lucky Jackson.
Bright-light city gonna set my soul
Gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money
That's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher
There's a thousand pretty women
Waiting out there
And they're all living
Devil-may-care
And I'm just a devil
With love to spare
So viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
How I wish that there were more
Than the 24 hours in the day
Even if there were 40 more
I wouldn't sleep a minute away
Oh, there's blackjack and poker
And the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on every deal
All you need's a strong heart
And a nerve of steel
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas with your neon flashing
And your one-arm bandits crashing
All those hopes down the drain
Viva Las Vegas turning day
Into nighttime
Turning night into daytime
If you see it once
You'll never be the same again
I'm gonna keep on the run
I'm gonna have me some fun
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke up
Well, I'll always remember
That I had a swinging time
I'm gonna give it
Everything I've got
Lady Luck, please let the dice stay hot
Let me shout a seven with every shot
Viva Las Vegas
Viva, viva Las Vegas
That was wonderful, wasn't it?
Let's see what the meter says.
It's right up there!
Looks like we got ourselves a tie.
Rusty, come on out, honey.
And Lucky. Lucky Jackson.
You kids were wonderful.
You were dynamite.
Let's decide who the winner is
Las Vegas-style.
I'll flip a silver dollar.
Ladies first.
Would you pick a toss, Rusty?
- Heads.
- Heads. Okay, here we go.
Tails.
He didn't toss it high enough.
Looks like the winner is Lucky Jackson!
We did it! We got the motor!
We did it, baby!
Of course, we do have a second prize for Miss Martin.
Take a look here.
How about that?
Not the girls, they go with me.
But here, for you, is a genuine, regulation-size...
...beautiful pool table.
Here's a wonderful evening of fun for the family.
Mom, Pop and the kiddies.
How about that?
I never expected anything so beautiful or so big.
I'm very happy. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
And now, the first prize.
First prize. Here we go.
Lucky, this is yours.
This beautiful silver trophy is all yours.
You hold it for one year and next year you hand it to next year's winner.
Wait a minute.
That's not all. That's not all.
You also receive...
Money. Money.
...an all-expense paid...
...two weeks' honeymoon!
Right here in fabulous Las Vegas!
How about that?
Oh, no.
- Just one more.
- Just one more.
Very good. That's all, kids, thanks very much.
- Congratulations.
- Nice going, Lucky.
- Thank you.
- Ask her, Lucky. Go ahead, ask her.
Rusty?
I'll trade you this honeymoon for your pool table because you don't need it.
I don't need a honeymoon.
Besides, I love it.
It's got a lot of practical uses.
She won't loosen up with it.
She can sell it, same as you.
There's no sense in trying.
We lost our motor.
I think I'll go jump over the dam and take this with me.
Excuse me, folks. It's rescue time.
I need somebody
Won't that somebody
Please, please listen to my plea?
Need that somebody
Won't that somebody
Come running to me?
I need somebody to lean on
I'm tired of being unhappy
And so blue
If she came, I would hold her
Because I need that shoulder
To lean on
Yes, I really do
I need somebody
And, baby, that somebody is you
- Hey, buddy. You seen Shorty?
- Nope.
I can't find him. Looks like he ran out. Took my car too.
No, that's not the way I want it.
Okay, Mancini. You win.
- You'll drive for me?
- No, I'll work on your car.
Okay. You work on my car,
I'll work on your girl.
You mind if I watch?
I always wanted to take a look at one, see how they've changed.
But of course, Mr. Martin.
- Lucky will explain everything to you.
- Well, thanks.
Sure. If it's all right with your daughter.
What has she got to say about it?
What are these?
That's a carburetor.
There are three here.
The only change...
Three?
Well, Father.
I thought you were going fishing.
I'm practically on my way.
Then you can take me with you.
Anybody who would marry this girl is a fool.
Hey, Lucky! Lucky!
Everybody! Look!
I got the motor!
Wait'll you see her! She's a beauty!
- We got it?
- Yes! She's ours!
We got it!
- Did you do this?
- Save your gratitude.
Why should I do it?
- Did you do it, Rusty?
- Me?
You think I'd have any part of this thing?
Stop being a detective.
Get to work.
You think you can have it running by midnight? It's noon.
- We can.
- You bet.
- If you need help, I'll...
- Father!
Honey, why don't you go fishing?
The fishing is good.
We need a chain pull.
Mr. Martin, an N wrench.
The torque wrench, Shorty.
On the double!
- We haven't got much time.
- Here.
- N wrench.
- Beautiful.
It's not an N wrench.
Does he love me most
Or love my rival?
Does he love my rival
More than me?
When the weekend comes
He's with my rival
Yes, he's with my rival constantly
And all through the week
My competition gets the praise
That style, that pep, that body line
There was a time when he praised mine
He's not fooling me
He's with my rival
And I know right where they are
He's carrying things too far
My rival is a baby-blue racing car
I could be the senorita
Or a lady of fame
A gold digger with a crazy figure
Beat her at her own game
I'll make you a bet
I'd make him forget
A hostess on jet
A sexy brunette
A model from Paris
A wealthy heiress
A chick who's a gas
Or a graduate of Vassar
A socialite who's out all night
A famous movie star
A debutante
Or Charlie's aunt
A golfer who shoots par
Can't compare the female gender
With a spare or with a fender
Rev it up and listen to it roar
While I watch the clock
And walk the floor
He's not fooling me
He's with my rival
And I know right where they are
He's carrying things too far
My rival is a baby-blue racing car
- Wheel's okay.
- Right.
Father, I brought you some food.
If he'll allow you to eat it.
Sorry, Pop. Why don't you take five.
Five what? Five days?
Get this junk out of here.
This junk happens to be nourishment for my father.
Do you really think your junk will be ready for midnight?
If you came to talk, you're wasting everybody's time.
If you want to help, put these on and get to work.
All right.
I will.
Hurry up and get me a wrench.
What wrench?
Over there in the tool case.
Yeah, sure.
Don't touch anything unless I tell you, please.
Where's the cord?
Put that plug back in!
Will you stop crossing the wires?
You're liable to blow us up!
Let me put you where you won't bother us.
Mr. Martin, will you get the girl out before she louses up the race?
Honey, go fishing. Make him happy.
She's plain ignorant. Let her stick around. She'll learn something.
- Where's the gun?
- What does he need a gun for?
- To shoot you if you don't move.
- No, a grease gun, honey. Over there.
- Is this it?
- Yeah!
I'm sorry. If we went fishing, none of this would have happened.
Give me the gun.
Oh, no.
Daughters.
Attention in the pit and garage area.
Let's get all the cars to the starting grid now.
A few are missing.
Let's bring them up.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the first Las Vegas Grand Prix.
We'll have TV cameras along the circuit to bring you this coverage.
Also, we'll be in communication by telephone.
Making his first appearance in this country is Count Mancini.
It won't start!
- We did it!
- We did it!
- Get them, Lucky!
- That's the idea.
At this time, we have not seen Lucky Jackson.
We have gotten word that they're working frantically to get this car ready.
Come on, let's push it!
Come on, let's push it. Push!
- We got it.
- I found the copter to fly the crew!
- What crew?
- You, your dad and me.
- Yeah, me.
- Come on, let's go!
- Come on, Lucky!
- Get them!
Get them, Lucky! Good luck!
Here comes Lucky Jackson now.
This is a real thriller.
We didn't think he'd make it...
...but they're bringing his car up now and he will be in the race.
This course will be around
Hoover Dam, Mount Charleston...
...and various points throughout the desert.
Attention all drivers.
Will you go to your starting positions now, gentlemen?
We'll start our countdown as soon as the drivers take their positions.
- It looks like they're there.
- Ten, nine, eight...
...seven, six...
...five...
...four, three...
...two, one.
Come on, let's go. Rusty, come on.
- Hurry! Come on!
- Sit back! Put your seat belt on.
It's 6:10 a.m.
Right now, they're approaching Hoover Dam.
Everybody coming through in apparently good order.
As the cars come over the dam, a beautiful sight to see.
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Come on, Lucky!
We did it! We did it!
You made a good investment when you brought the money for that motor...
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
- Send me a card. I'll miss you.
- Right, partner.
Take good care of her.
Bright-light city gonna set my soul
Gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money
That's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher
There's a thousand pretty women
Waiting out there
And they're all living
Devil-may-care
And I'm just a devil with love to spare
So viva Las Vegas

He should have his own room.
He should have a nurse.
We should have a maid.
No! Don't touch me.

Ma Femme.

What are you talking about?
You want some of it? l'll give you the special mother's rate.
Mama's little helper, $1 .50 a cube.
Yuck. l've been saving for four months and l've got $800 stashed away.
That's enough to leave home with, right?

You're really developing quite an imagination.
-What is it?
-lt's going to be a bomb. l'm not going to let you watch television late at night anymore. l'm going to blow up the old man's Chrysler with it.
His new car?
But Papa loves his new Chrysler.
More than he loves Mommy?
You bet he does.
He'd sleep with it in the garage if l'd let him.
The way things are going l just might let him.
Yuck.

You're a minority, man.
You're groovy, but you're outnumbered.
Who in the hell is in the majority, man?
You read the papers, don't you?
Yeah, l read the papers.
You don't read the papers.
Yeah, l read them on Wednesday.
You know what l read in the papers?
No, but l know what you roll in the papers. l'm going to tell you what l read in the paper. l read that 52 percent.. .
52 percent of America is under 25 years old.
The rest of them, babies, they're the minority!
We're the majority.
Baby we made it
We're 52 percent
Yeah, we're 52 percent
They got TVshows for us
We're 52 percent
They design the clothes for us
We're 52 percent
They play the songs we dig
We're 52 percent
And we make big business big
We're 52 percent
They know we set the trend
We're 52 percent
And their economy depends on
52 percent, babies
You and me
We're the power
We're the fashion
in their great society
So come on brothers
And sisters
My troops, my people
We got something going
The whole country is our destiny
lf we just pick our spots
We're going to call all the shots
Turn up the sound.
Turn up the sound!
Louder!
We're 52 percent
They design the clothes for us
We're 52 percent
They play the songs we dig
We're 52 percent
And we make big business big l think that's Max Jacob Jr.
That's a madman.
Max, that's Max Jacob Jr.
52 percent, babies
You and me
But that boy's insane.
Max Jacob was insane. l'm going to have my face lifted and my hair bleached.
And your hair dyed.
And my teeth capped.
We can afford it all now!
And you'll get a top-dollar toupee.
We've got to look our best and youngest when we go see him.
See him?
Sure we'll see him. l'm somebody. l'm the mother of a famous man. l'm a celebrity.
Just remember
We're 52 percent
You look young, you look fantastic.
Maximillian Frost!
You should be very proud. lf you could get him to write my son a letter.. ..
What color is his skin?
He's supposed to go to the draft board for his physical.
He's got to cut his hair or Lord knows what they'll do.
He said to say good night to the kid.
An hour later you find him asleep.
What's his hang-up? l think he's even further out back than l am. l think he prefers three-year-olds to anybody.
Yes, he loves them.
Just loves them.
That's right.
They're better than we are.
Sweetums. l feel like a fool.
Nonsense.
You look beautiful, darling. Just beautiful.
Now you're the man l married.
The man l married, not just some toy manufacturer.
The man that l said to my mother about:
''l don't care what his religion is.' '
Sweetums.. ..
Snookums. lt's going to be like a second honeymoon, baby.
We'll go to his concert and we'll surprise him.
His mommy and daddy will be there.
He should know that we're coming.
Mom and Dad?
-Maybe we shouldn't go.
-Of course we're going to go.
Mother and Father.. . journeying into the west.. . following a star.
The reason l advocate votes
for 18-year-olds in California...
in every state, is because...
l don't think we have the moral right
to draft a man...
and deny him the right to vote for
the government that's asking him to fight.
Congressman, if you did secure the vote
for 18-year-olds in California...
wouldn't you expect them to be grateful...
and vote for you
when you run for the Senate?
l think an 18-year-old
can be trusted to make his decisions...
on realistic, political grounds.
Eighteen? Hell, man, fourteen!
Billy Cage, living computer, how old are you, Billy Bob?
Fifteen.
As for the draft, we insist upon their
standing up and being counted.
This is the guy who wants me to sing at his rally, isn't it?
-Yeah.
-Next week.
He's kind of old.
He's only 37.
That's 37, that's old.
There is no 37, baby.
That's right, baby. There ain't no 37.
He's got a lot of teeth in that smile, don't he?
He's cute, isn't he, Billy?
Yeah, okay, he's beautiful.
How long do you think you're going to live?
Thirty, man.
Thirty?
Twenty-five, maybe.
After that who needs it, right? l don't want to live to be 30.
Thirty is death, baby.
That's too much.
The only thing that blows your mind when you're 30 is.. . getting guys to kill other guys.
Only in another city or country where you don't see it.
They don't know anything about it. l'm his mother!
We want Max!
We want Max! l'm his mother! l'm his mother.
Sorry! No cancellations. No returns.
No tickets!
You don't understand. l'm the mother and this is the-- l'm sorry, ma'am, this afternoon's concert is sold out. lt's the first time we're going to see him perform. lt's a surprise. Damn you, kids.
You may not entirely enjoy a Max Frost performance. l am Max Frost's mother.
Everybody is!
Cool is dead
Baby don't you cry
lt was time
For cool to die
So burn it
and let go of yesterday
And don't be afraid
you ain't gonna lose your way
Just listen to the music
That's all you gotta know
Just listen to the music
lt'll take you where
You wanna go
Close the door
And open up your mind
Mama's dreams
Were not your kind
So tune into the message
that you hear
lt's comin' in
lt's comin' in loud and clear
Just listen to the music
That's all you gotta do
Just listen to the music
Just follow where
lt's leadin' you
Just listen to the music
That's all you gotta know
Just listen to the music
lt'll take you where
You wanna go
Just listen to the music
Just listen to the music
Just listen to the music l'm his mother! l'm Max Frost's mother.
Let go, you brute!
Max!
Police brutality! l'm Max Jacob Jr.' s mommy!
Darling, baby!
Let her go!
There, l told you!
Darling.
Darling baby!
Max Jacob Jr. makes more money than his daddy.
Honey, everything at home is just the way you left it. lt's your Mount Vernon, your Hyde Park.
Your mansion, your log cabin.
Daddy! You let him alone. l told you l was his mother!
This is his father.
-Daddy, tell him you love him.
-l love you.
A Rolls Royce! Let me drive. l can drive.
Remember l drove you to school.
-Let my bird drive.
-Yeah, let his bird drive. l can drive, Max! l'm young enough to drive.
But maybe you're not old enough.
Don't you hate me?
What did you do?
What did you do?
Billy, get her a lawyer and get her outta this.
And you stay away from me!
You stay away from me!
You'd kill God Almighty himself if you could get your hands on him.
A couple of pictures only.
They gotta see Max Frost.
Mary, the family said to Jimmy, they think that's what this rally is all about.
How are you?
Yes, l do. l'm glad to hear that.
How are you?
How are you? Nice to see you again.
We can go right in through here. l'm gonna put you down because you're heavy.
Mary, is everybody here? lt's right down here. How are you, Sam?
-Stay nice.
-l will.
Max! How are you? lt's nice to have you here.
This is Mrs. Fergus.
-How are you?
-This is little Mary.
And these are your great fans.
Meeting the President didn't mean anything, but you're--
More famous than Jesus.
-Jimmy.
-Hi. l think you write better songs than anyone. l think your old man's groovy too.
This is Joseph.
Dad won't let us grow our hair long until we're at least 16.
He's the comedian.
Come on, Max. We're on.
Nice to meet you. l don't know if any of my troops are out there tonight.
They tell me.. .
Johnny Fergus.. . is a pretty groovy guy.
That means a swinger.
They tell me he's young.
Johnny Fergus is 37 years old.
lf he were in baseball,
he'd be all fagged out, baby.
lf he were a boxer, man, forget it.
Now let's talk about chicks.
You know that l have never met a chick.. . who admitted to being 35.
Unless maybe she was 75!
Now, let's get serious.
Johnny Fergus is running on the platform that.. . if you're old enough to die for your country.. . then you're old enough to vote.
And l'm all for that.
He wants to change the voting age to 18.
Eighteen.. . man... that's still playing sneaky panther games.
You know.. . the boy who does my income tax.. . and l'm rich, babies.. . is 15!
Billy Cage is 15.
Johnny Fergus, you want to level with us?
You want to join our club, baby?
Then you give us the vote at 1 4.
Fourteen!
Fourteen or fight.
What hell's he doing? lt's a joke, l think. l got a song l've been doing weird things with all day.
Don't know if l know all the words or not, but l'm gonna try to sing it for you.
Fourteen or fight
Fourteen
or fight
Fourteen

We're gonna do it up
right
We got the numbers now
We want the vote now
Get ready to go now
lt's time we started rockin' the boat

Fourteen or fight
Youth power that's where
the whole thing's at now

Everybody now
A little louder now
One more time
Fourteen or fight
What about the chicks?
Nobody gave them the vote.
They fought for it.
Be cool, they tell us.
Man, cool is out.
The chicks would've killed for the vote.
What about you?
You know we got the old tigers scared, baby.
Because right now, we outnumber the fuzz.. . and we outnumber the shopkeepers.
We could take all the old tigers and stuff them back into their tanks.
We got more cats than little old Mahatma Gandhi had.
Troops.. . you know the Strip?
This Saturday night, where are you gonna be?
Because l'm gonna be on the Strip this Saturday night.
And l think l'm gonna lay down on those sweet pavements.. . until those old tigers.. . let the boy who does my income tax vote.
Gettin' old, lookin' old
that's a drag now
Fourteen or fight
The country's into
a brand new bag now
Fourteen or fight
We got a chance
and we ain't gonna blow it
Fourteen or fight
We ain't kiddin'
and you better know it
Fourteen or fight
Fourteen or fight
Everybody now
Let me hear you
Everybody now
A little louder now
One more time
Fourteen or fight lf we're all on the Strip Saturday night.. . l want to see if those old tigers can stop the future.
That's right.
Are you gonna be with me?
Are you gonna be with me? l want the hippies.. . l want the heads.. . l want all of you.. .. l want the two-car kids.. . l want the mother lovers.. . l want the all-in-one-bedroom kids with their mama.. ..
And l want the ones who can't even stand their old ladies! l want all of you!
Dangerous nonsense. l want to see you in the Senate.
We need you there.
An old bastard like myself needs help in the Senate.
We need men, not song and dance men, but men!
But the reaction around the country.. . people couldn't be more disturbed with you at this moment.
There are no riots.
There don't need to be, not even on Saturday.
Zero minus 72 hours, that's what it said on TV this morning.
My wife has taken nothing but tranquilizers since breakfast.
Senator Allbright, that's just it.
Television and the newspapers have snowballed this. lt's a natural for them.
Damn it! You people don't seem to realize it's serious! l'm sorry. Excuse me.
Amos.. . we don't know they're coming at all.
We don't know they're not. lf there's trouble, you'll be responsible.
That lunatic boy has to go on television with you and call it off.
He may not want to.
He's on a publicity bender at the moment.
You raised up this monster at your rally.
Your idea, Belli!
You two make your shaggy little monster behave and get rid of him.
What are you doing?
Don't play his records, not now.
Why? ls Dad going to see him tonight?
Can we come?
-No.
-Why?
Enough. Everyone go to bed. lt's too early.
Come on!
Do you think l should be able to vote?
Dad said l have twice the political brain he has.
Jimmy!
Do you think l should be able to vote or not?
Jimmy, if you love your father, you'll trust him.
That's what George lll said to the Americans in 1 776.
Trust me.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Jack Latham reporting to you from Beverly Hills, California. lt's Thursday night.. . zero minus 48 hours.
Apparently, Max Frost and his group have been persuaded.. . to have a meeting with Congressman Fergus and his group.
The scene.. .
Max Frost's home here in Beverly Hills.
Some commentators are now anticipating that this meeting.. . may be another Munich.
Serious?
Don't get yourself into that bag. l am serious.
Your worlds may be pretty flat but mine goes round and round.
Max. l can call you Max?
Use any part of me you want.
Why 1 4?
Why 1 4 or fight? lsn't 16 more reasonable?
Tommyrot!
Seventeen?
More responsible.
Hey! Hey, gang.
My hand shakes now, man. lt didn't shake when l was 1 2.
The same with my brain, baby.
You dig that whole votin' thing,
Johnny baby?
Yeah.. .. l mean, you don't worry, reasonable, responsible, huh?
You're takin' a nutty chance lettin' them 50-year-olds vote for you, baby.
Really, l mean, who knows if the Mayor's responsible? l beg your pardon?
Who knows if the Police Commissioner is responsible? Mr. Belli?
Who knows if they're responsible?
Let old folks in the old folks' home vote!
You know what my mother used to do when l was a kid?
My mother used to.. ..
She used to boil my leather shoes.
Sterilize them, right? Keep my feet safe.
They let her vote.
She voted three times for Roosevelt.
Same as everybody else.
Our great republic has found its strength and wisdom.. . in the mysterious will of the electorate.
That's some far-out religious bag.
You let the chicks vote.
We're gonna get the vote.
You're a filthy rabble!
You make a mockery of our most sacred institutions.
''Kill for the vote!''
You said that.
You dare to say that our fair mothers would've killed for the vote?
Our most militant suffragettes earned the vote, worked for it patiently. lf that's what's got you uptight, forget it.
Give me liberty or give me death, baby.
Appalling!
The Founding Fathers, they didn't have in mind dyin'.. . if they didn't get the vote.
They had in mind fightin'.
They didn't have a big bomb.. . but they weren't using water pistols either. ln a war, you're killing every man, woman and child.. . to get them to vote your way.
Youth is not only wasted on the young, it's become a disease!
With luck and health it is a disease from which you will all recover.
Johnny Fergus, these young people are being told every day and every way.. . that their state is more blessed than the state of anyone who is older.
They must either stop the clock or go mad.
Look about you!
You must have been some groovy cat at 1 7, man.
How often can you do it at 80?
Whatever papa can do, baby boy can do more times and better.
God the Father, young man.. . can never be replaced by God the Eternal Juvenile Son.
Oh, my God!
-What the.. ..
-That's terrible. lt's only tiger's milk.
What kind of a place is this?
This is Sally LeRoy.
She used to be a child star.
-She started posing naked.
-Max, enough. Enough! l owe you an apology. lt is disgraceful that we should be here at all.
You must repudiate these people.
-You've got to learn--
-Halt!
-You've got to cope with these kids.
-Never!
-We can. l can!
-No! Nothing!
Listen.. . l can't write these kids off. We need them.
-You need them!
-Yes, l need them.
You want to be Senator that much? l can handle them, Amos.
-How's the meeting going, Senator?
-No comment.
Senator, do you have a statement about Fergus?
No comment.
Senator, can you tell us.. . will Congressman Fergus be read out of the party?
No comment.
Do you and the Congressman still see eye to eye?
All right, you've had your fun, right?
Let me tell you one thing, and understand it well.
Amos Allbright runs this state.
Without him you don't get what you want.. . and l don't get what l want.
There'll be no victory celebration for anyone.
Really?
Really.
Yeah, he's right.
Suppose l change ''Fourteen or Fight'' to ''Fourteen and Ready''?
Sixteen and ready.
No, for Billy's sake, 15.
Sixteen. l'm 15.
You know, General Motors wanted me. l turned them down.
Rand Corporation wanted me, too.
You're a bright guy.
Fifteen and ready.
But you've got to call for a peaceable demonstration.
Peaceable.
-All right.
-No violence.
The hell with violence, man. l don't want any violence. l'm going to stake my political career on you, Max.
My future, my life.
And mine. l'm going to support your demonstration.
You're ridin' the future, Johnny baby. l have not committed myself to this undertaking.. . to this demonstration lightly.
But perhaps here in California,
of all the states...
perhaps here
we're ready to make a leap into the future. l wonder if l could get him. l wonder if l could get him. lsn't he too old for you? lsn't Max enough for you?
No, not promise...
the promise has been kept.
Our young people are citizens...
they're concerned, committed...
original, vital.
They are citizens.
We must give them the rights of citizens.
And on that note,
it's my pleasure to present to you...
Mr. Max Frost.
Stupid son of a bitch!
Troops, l'm not going to sing tonight...
but somebody told me
my Fourteen or Fight song...
has already been heard all over the nation.
And l haven't even had time
to press the record yet.
Anyway, l'm changing that
to Fifteen and Ready.
That way you'll see two of us
on the Strip tomorrow night.
Myself...
and Johnny Fergus.
Now, troops...
one thing...
tomorrow night, come,
do come, but keep your cool.
Peaceable, law-abiding tomorrow night.
And be there at 10/00.
Good night, troops. Peace.
lt is now only three hours
since the Max-Fergus telecast.
And teenagers have already begun arriving.
Not on Saturday night as expected,
but on Friday night.
And they're arriving not in small groups,
but by the thousands.
There are bonfires.
Many surfboards
have been offered up for the cause.
So far, everything is peaceful.
But it is still 24 hours before Max Frost...
and John Fergus have promised to appear.
We have never seen a crowd
of this size or dimension.
lt's dawn in Los Angeles.
A large section of the city is paralyzed.
No one has ever seen anything like it.
The anthem of the new revolution...
has intermittently swept the city
like an enormous wave.
lt can be heard
as far west as Pacific Palisades.
The Hollywood Freeway, eastbound... has jammed the Harbor, Santa Ana and San Bernardino Freeways.
Although the sleeping-bag squatters
still rest blissfully...
the biggest block party in history
is seemingly underway.
And there have been casualties.
Three Orange County matrons have died of heart attacks.. . in the safety of their homes while watching the demonstration on TV.
Reports from up North are similar. Although
Max asked for no demonstrations...
they parallel those here in Orange County. l assure you we'll bring you up-to-the-minute developments.
As Mayor of Los Angeles,
l plead with you to return to your homes.
Return peaceably, return now!
l assure that we will respond...
have responded
to your spectacular demonstration.
Dad, why can't we go?
Jimmy, for God's sake, use what little brain you have!
Don't you hear what the Mayor is saying?
Who cares? He's an old bastard!
Go to your room.
Dad?
-We're all brats, but--
-Joseph.
You and mother.. . you're like our brother and sister.
We both say it. You're so young. lf nobody wants to be old anymore.. . why should kids want to be old?
Grow up, wait.. . for anything?
Son.. ..
You fish better than l do, Dad. l don't mean that you don't.
But should you try to ski.. . and play ball better and things like that? l read it someplace in China once.. . the older you were.. . the more.. . worthy you are.
lmmediately following
the Mayor's plea to the teenagers...
The earth-shaking chant/
''We want Fergus! We want Max!''
has swept the city.
No sound, broadcast or otherwise...
has been able to penetrate
for the past 27 minutes.
Max Frost's troops are mobilized,
but the big question now is...
what does the young Mr. Frost
plan to do with his army?
Sold out, baby! l'm King, baby. l'm King!
Hey, King?
Touch me, man.
See if you can change the hook back into a hand. l would change it back, baby, but.. . l don't want to blow our luck.
And l love it. l love it. l think you boys are fags.
lt is 2/00 pm, Saturday afternoon.
The Governor of California has called for
a special session of the State Legislature...
and has endorsed Johnny Fergus' bill
to lower the voting age.
Max Frost and Johnny Fergus...
have been picked up by a police helicopter.
They have agreed to appear
as soon as possible...
so that the teenagers
may be persuaded to disperse.
Troops!
America has heard you.. . because you are America!
Remember, there will be no violence!
This is the greatest demonstration in the history of this country.
Remember that a vote for Johnny Fergus is a vote for you.
And a vote for Max Frost.
At each stop, Johnny Fergus and Max Frost
have thanked the teenagers for appearing...
and then have asked them to go home,
after which...
carefully and slowly, they once more
ascended toward the heavens.
Within a week, three states,
including California...
have enacted legislation to lower
the voting age to 14.
Within a month, 18 other states,
it seems, will follow suit.
Max Frost has simply to mention locations
for possible demonstrations...
and emergency sessions
of state legislatures...
are convened and are acquiescent.
Johnny Fergus' campaigns and campaign films.. .
have always capitalized
on his youthful image.
Fergus has always expected
the new frontiersman...
the youth of America,
the Kennedy generation, to vote for him.
Now it seems to many that he was gambling
for the highest stakes of all.
Enfranchise youth...
and perhaps youth will carry him to the top.
The Kennedy mystique would naturally get out of hand in the West.
There, the pursuit of happiness has long been replaced.. . by a headier flight back into pubescence.
Hey, what's.. ..
Damn!
Hey, wait a minute, baby. Hold it, brother.
-Who are you?
-l'm Jimmy Fergus!
-What do you want?
-l hate my father.
And he hates you all.
So what do you want me to do about it?
Listen. My father gets the kids the vote.
But Tuesday he's going to get elected.
-But that means he's--
-He's going to be King.
Dog King! King of the dogs!
Your old man's going to get elected big, baby.
The day after tomorrow, because of you.
But he's not your kind.
He's not our kind.
Come on, l'm sleepy. Get out of here.
Wait a minute!
The Congressman died this morning.
He was 84. Cancer.
They got to replace him. l heard my father talking about it tonight.
All you need is somebody just 25 years old.
Just 25. You could pick the congressman. l'm 22. l'm 1 4.
Sally's going to be 25 on Tuesday.
Congresswoman Sally LeRoy.
What do you want? ln.
Sure.
Listen, fellas, listen.
Wait, please listen.
We've had a long hard day. ln the morning we'll have a press conference and answer your questions.
Meanwhile, thank you and tell everybody it feels great to be Senator.
-l'm so worried, Johnny.
-We won, Mary.
We won very big.
Didn't even have to wait for a concession.
Honey, come on. Jimmy will be all right.
You'll see. Basically, he's a sensible kid.
Hey, troops! l've got good news for you today.
Two things!
First.. . we got Johnny Fergus elected!
We did it!
And second.. . today is Sally LeRoy's birthday.
Representative Sealy.. . from Sally LeRoy's own congressional district.. .
died a few days ago of cancer.
There's going to have to be
a special election, babies.
And l've got news for you...
you only have to be 25 years old...
to run for Congress!
And who do you think we should have in Congress.. . instead of Congressman Sealy,
84 years old?
Do you know who can't be elected to Congress.. . because he's not 25 years old?
l can't! That's who!
And who can't be your President?
Even if you wanted him to be!
l can't! That's who!
Sally LeRoy, troops, is going to be our spearhead.
She's going to Washington.
And she's not going alone.
Because we're going with her!
Sally used to model for lvory soap
as a job
This Sally in a tub used to drive
the other babies wild
That's what they say
Sally hasn't come out since that day
Sally LeRoy
Sally LeRoy
She's old enough
for Congress, boy
She could represent us
You bet she knows how
Give it to me, Sally baby
She's no baby, now
The Speaker of the House...
recognizes the new Congresswoman
from California...
Sally LeRoy.
Mr. Speaker.. .
America's greatest contribution.. . has been to teach the world.. . that getting old is such a drag.
Youth is America's secret weapon.
That's why we ask.. . that the Constitution.. . be amended.
So that the secret weapon can be used.
Amend! Amend!
We suggest.. . that the required age.. . for a representative.. . be.. . fourteen.
For a senator.. . fourteen.
For President.. . fourteen.
Fourteen or fight!
For 40 days and 40 nights
the sit-down has spread...
like a multi-colored beach blanket
from the Capitol to the White House.
Teenagers have poured in
from all parts of the country...
on every plane, on every train.
Amend! Amend!
The President, as you know, appeared today on television.. . begging the teenagers to go home, apparently to no avail.
Washington remains besieged.
Senator Allbright! ls it true that most of your colleagues have taken up residence.. .
-in their offices at the Capitol?
-Yes. l don't know.
Will you vote for the amendments? l love you. l love you. l love all of you!
Please, believe me. l love all children!
Senator Allbright,
Mr. and Mrs. United States.. . as you know the jails have long since been filled with teenagers.. . who in the beginning refused to move on.
The police find it very difficult to direct people to move on.
Three or four million people to move on!
The military and the police are helpless.. . unless directed to fire on the crowd.. . and that seems unthinkable.
Amend! Amend!
Oh, my God! lt's happening. lt's happening now!
There's a new sun
Rising up angry in the sky
And there's a new voice
Crying we're not afraid to die
Let the old world make believe
lt's blind, deaf and dumb
But nothing can change
the shape of things to come
There are changes
Lying ahead every road
And there are new thoughts
Ready and waiting to explode
When tomorrow is today
The bells will toll for some
But nothing can change
the shape of things to come
The future's coming in now
Sweet and strong
Ain't no one can hold it back
for long
There are new dreams
Crowding out old realities
There's revolution
Sweeping like a fresh new breeze
Let the old world make believe
lt's blind, deaf and dumb
But nothing can change
the shape of things
Nothing can change
the shape of things
Nothing can change
the shape of things
Nothing can change
the shape of things to come
Troops.. . they've slaughtered 1 2 of you.
They did that to us.
They came with their soldiers and their cops.. . and they did that to us. l'm glad you came.
You.. ..
You look.. ..
How are things at the old homestead, Dad?
We miss you, Jimmy.
Very badly.
Sorry l'm late. lt's not easy getting around Washington these days, is it?
No, you have to kind of tiptoe between the teenagers.
Your people.
Jimmy, why can't you come home? l'm busy. ls that all you're going to say?
No. l'm part of Max's political brain trust.
You see, you put down the Republicans, Dad.
That's easy.
But you Democrats solved all your problems
30 years ago.
The same as them.
There aren't going to be any wars anymore.
Not big ones, we know that. lf we didn't have a foreign policy, we wouldn't even have small wars.
Max feels that we don't need a foreign policy.
And at home, everybody's rich. lf they're not, they can sleep on the beaches.. . and live like they're rich anyway.
There aren't even any Negroes anymore, the way you Democrats think.
You think you see them, but l don't think l see them.
All l see is a man who got out on the shore and started his tan sooner than l did.
When that new order comes in--
You know, you're.. ..
You could drive a man to drink!
See?
You're part of that alcoholic generation.
-You need to drink.
-Stop it!
-l ought to take you over my knee--
-That would be your solution.
Sit!
Sit down.
Dad, l have the vote now, remember? ln your own way, l suppose you're a great man.
You helped us start it all.
Goodbye.
You know, l really don't dig that family scene.
That's your hang-up, Senator. Not mine.
Johnny?
You're drunk.
Damn right, l'm drunk. l'm a part of that alcoholic generation.
We pour napalm on our own men.
We do it because we're drunk.
Good, old, old, patriotic drunk!
Johnny!
-Daddy!
-Johnny! Stop it!
Goodbye, Mr. Frost!
Goodbye, mister!
Johnny, stop it!
From now on, you read Winnie-the-Pooh or you don't read anything!
And Little Women!
Little Women! l hate you, Daddy! l hate you!
War council!
We got votes, but we don't have enough.
How do you break a deadlock in Washington?
Blackmail.
Or we could raid the FBl.
With what's in J. Edgar's files.. .. l'm serious.
We need a two-thirds vote now, baby.
Hey.. . assassinations.
We could start picking them off one by one in Congress.
Every time someone makes a speech against.. . they die.
She's out with our friendly neighborhood lifeguard, acid.
LSD.
That's it, baby.
We turn them all on, right?
We can make them all happy.
That's it, baby.
All out on trips!
We put it in the water supply.
Mother lover!
With a teenage guide for each one, to make sure it's a happy trip.
A voting trip!
We send all our troops home.
The ones that stay to help us.. . they don't touch water, coffee, anything!
Nothing!
We're straight.
And them out on trips.
Anything they open, they open with bottle cap openers.
Or a hook.
Stanley, book us back to Washington.
You go to Senator Mason, 3050 Park Street.
Get moving.
You take Congressman Parker,
507 North Street.
You'll take Senator Fergus.. .. l'll take that man myself.
Gentlemen, let us vote!
All in favor, signify by raising your hand.
Two, three, four.. . five, six, seven.. . eight, nine, ten!
Who cares?
On this Friday of August.. ..
No!
Senator Fergus, you didn't have to use detectives to find us.
We're not in hiding.
Some time ago, we had a little accident, and ever since.. . we had an accident, my husband.. ..
You could hardly believe that he's my husband.
We.. ..
He's retired. l'm very flattered that you've chosen to visit us.
But l don't understand, what did you mean by.. . my... my son's reign of terror?
We're desperate.
Mrs. Flatow.
He's paralyzed the country.
-See, if you--
-Senator. l'm sure my son.. . has a very good reason for paralyzing the country.
But if you could just persuade him.
You see, ever since the accident.. . l've.. . l've been under the care of an LSD therapist.
And l understand my son now. l understand him completely. l identify with that marvelous Sally LeRoy! l could not persuade my son from his purposes.
You never read in the Bible.. . about the mother of Jesus.. . persuading her son from his purposes.
No.. ..
You.. ..
You tell my son his mother is behind him.
She is behind him.
No, l won't talk to Eisenhower.
l ain't going to talk to Rockefeller
and l won't talk to Dirksen.
You got to be out of your Chinese skulls. l won't take their nomination. l run my own party or l run Democrat.
You are really getting square. Tell him.
The Republicans want you, Max.
You don't even have to pull any stunts.
They've been looking for a hero ever since they lost Eisenhower.
Nixon would sure look dumb with long hair.
And Ronald Reagan would look worse.
Nobody's going to take this country this year with short hair!
Think of it!
You, the true son and heir of Herbert Hoover and Calvin Coolidge.
Stanley.
Republican, baby.
Republican.
Me, a Republican?
Yeah. All right.
You got a big mouth.
You got a square head.
Thanks, Max.
Now, troops.. . l have nothing against our President. lt's like running against my own grandfather. l don't understand.
Do you really want a man in his sixties running the country?
No!
What do you ask a 60-year-old man?
You ask him whether he wants his wheelchair facing the sun.. . or facing away from the sun.
But running our country? Forget it, babies!
Who in America can truly resist the clarion call of youth?
Never has it been so brazenly sounded.
Experience, it has brought you nothing.
Max Frost has told you that.
Down with experience. lf your son is elected President,
Mrs. Flatow.. . will you, because he's a bachelor.. . will you be his White House hostess?
Pamela.. . l hope to help my son in important ways.
Possibly be a consul general to one of those Latin countries.
But l will probably have to be.. .
Ambassador to the Court of St. James.
-You see, the Queen and l--
-Mrs. Flatow!
What about the rumor there's been a falling out between you and Max Frost?
Pamela, let me first remind you that my name is no longer Mrs. Flatow.
Like my son, l had it changed legally. lt's Mrs. Frost.
And Max and l could never have a falling out.
Lovers' quarrel, perhaps.
But that's all.
Will Mr. Flatow.. .. l mean, Mr. Frost.
Will he be part of the new government?
My husband is so laid up.
You can't believe how laid up he is.
Proud.. . proud.. . so proud.
Hey, troops! l've got good news for you today.
Hey, troops! l've got good news.
We want Max!
Maximillian Frost has been elected
President of the United States...
by the largest majority
in the history of our country.
He has carried every state...
with the single
and remarkable exception of Hawaii.
Mr. Speaker.. .
Senators.. .
Representatives.. . troops.
You want to know what the state of the union is.
And l'm going to tell you what the state of the union is.
You know, our folks.. . say that there is a fly.. . in the ointment.
And it's not the Communists.. . and it's not the Birchers.
There is a villain in history, though.
And it's not the Jews.. . it's not the labor leaders.. . it's not the bankers.. . and it's not the Russians, and it isn't even the Chinese!
Who?
Who, after all, has caused all of our troubles?
Those who are stiff, baby!
Not with love but with age!
So while we're young.. . we've lived in small pads with no bread.
While they're living high and fat.. . with all the money!
Well, troops.. . l want to tell you that they're heavy with honey.. . and they can't fly.
You'd better believe me that they can't fly!
Now.. . some of us.. . have changed this for ourselves already.
But.. . now we're going to change it.. . for everyone.
You give me.. . the tools.
You give me the laws.
Give me the power!
He's got a gun!
Let him go.
He won't get far.
We're going to make.. . thirty.. . a mandatory retirement age.
We'll set up rehabilitation camps.. . mercy centers in every state of the union.
Citizens will report to them after five years.. . at the age of 35.
And there.. . in groovy surroundings we're going to psych them all out.. . on LSD, babies.
That way.. . they're not going to hurt you.. . and they're not going to hurt me.. . and, babies, they're not even going to hurt themselves anymore!
They won't draft you.
We'll draft them!
Some of them are really going to dig it.
That's going to be the real
mother-lovin' gas.
There'll be cats who'll want
to split from taxes, Diner's Club...
crazy birds, crazy wives
and crazy husbands!
Millions, troops...
but millions are going to go willingly.
Just tell them
they don't owe nobody nothing.
And, babies, what a wrap-up!
Suffer unto me, little old lady.
The best campaign dinners

Hawaii, the only state
which has not voted for Max...
was given a lethal overdose in toto of STP.
The survivors are a weird,
hearty breed now...
largely nomadic,
and strangely ill-coordinated.
They do not seem to understand
what has happened to them.
Mr. President?
Has it been brought to your attention that there are many subversive citizens.. . over 35 who are passing for 25?
What do you intend to do about this situation?
My feeling is if they can fool us then they're all right.
Anyone who is that lively is not dangerous.
Mr. President, look this way.
Mr. President. Thank you.
We've heard that there have been.. . cases in which mothers and fathers.. . relatives, and in some cases, complete strangers.. . who've been hidden in attics or basements by much younger citizens.
What are the dangers of this hidden population of old people?
No one hiding in a basement or an attic is likely to do much harm to the country.
Are they?
Although they're not as effectively neutralized as those in the camps.. . they are nonetheless out of business.
And as time goes by, they will be ferreted out.
What about the possibility of underground railroads?
By that you mean.. . our old people who've been smuggled into Canada, Cuba, Mexico?
As you know, the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada.. . and Fidel Castro are all very old men.
They're old-fashioned and they're old. l say to them.. . do they think they can stop the revolution that is coming in their own country?
Do they think our old people will prolong their existence for a year?
A month or even a day?
Dad, look!
Run!
Like the United States...
Russia, too has abandoned
its moon program.
ln its Russian translation...
Fourteen or Fight
has already swept that country.
Red China has denounced rock music.
However, from all reports,
the rallying song...
of the vast teenage underground movement
in the far east...
is the song,
Don't Wanna Be No Yellow Peril.
Mrs. Flatow, baby,
your husband is very happy in the camp.
Your husband would like you to join him.
Max would like you to join him.
No, l'm young! lt's a mistake! l'm young!
You are the biggest mother of them all.
No! l'm really young! l'm young! lt's a mistake! l'm young!
No! l'm very young!
America is now planning to withdraw
from its international commitments...
to the relief of many, the despair of few.
ln addition,
our armed forces are to be disbanded.
The President has said
that with our immense wealth...
we will be able to create
the most purely hedonistic society...
the world has ever known.
We've already begun shipping free grain...
to all the hungry countries on this planet. l'm going to leave her here.
You take care of her. l don't want to stay.
You're going to have to stay because l'm telling you to.
And l'm President.
Can l be President?
No.
Why?
Because you're not old enough.
How old are you?
How old do you think l am?
About 100! l'm 24.
That's old. l have to go. l'm being presented.. .. l'm being presented in the Court of St. James!
The Queen!
The Queen is receiving me!
The Queen is receiving me! l need feathers! l have to have feathers!
White feathers to be proper and respectable.. . by my son, my son.. ..
My country 'tis of thee.. . sweet land of liberty!
Following the dissolution of the FBl
and the ClA...
President Max Frost has now done away
with the Secret Service...
allowing him a personal freedom...
that for generations has been unheard of
for a public figure.
''Protection, '' Max Frost has said,
''who needs it?''
That's old.
That's old.
That's old.
What did you do with our crawdad? l killed him.
He was our pet.
His name was Willeger.
What are you going to do about it?
You ain't big enough to beat me up, are you?
We're going to put everybody over ten out of business.
Bye, bye, Birdie
I'm gonna miss you so
Bye, bye, Birdie
Why'd ya have to go
Bye, bye
- No more sunshine
- Sunshine
- It's followed you away
- You away
I'll cry, Birdie
Till you're home to stay
I'll miss the way you smile as though it's just for me
And each and every night
I'll write you faithfully
Bye, bye, Birdie
It's awful hard to bear
Bye, bye, Birdie
Guess I'll always care
Guess I'll always care
Guess I'll always care
Look! Look! Hey!
We love you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do
We love you, Conrad
And we'll be true
When you're not near us
We're blue
We're blue
Oh, Conrad, we love you
This is John Daly reporting with the CBS mobile unit... in front ot the nation's capitol... bringing you on-the-spot coverage of our current teenage crisis... over the drafting of Conrad Birdie.
Sociologists agree that Birdie is a phenomenon.
For those few music lovers who have never attended one of his concerts... here are some news photos tracing his meteoric rise.
And that... that is our army's newest weapon.
Private Birdie reports for his induction in ten days.
His income drops from $2 million a year... to $78 a month.
It could only happen in America.
Why?
Why did they have to dratt him?
Just when I tinally write a song he's gonna do.
The title song of his next picture.
"Mumbo Jumbo Gooey Gumbo."
Now there's no picture.
There's nothing.
Albert, I have your tinancial statement, it you really want to hear it.
"Total assets: $312.08.
Liabilities: $4,030."
You...
Contidentially, you're a fiscal tiasco.
Good-bye, Albert. It's a sad ending to a long association.
Yeah. Oh, don't you want to say good-bye to Pidge?
Almaelou's busted, Pidge. You better get yourself another meal ticket.
In six years
I never sold one lousy song.
Maybe they weren't lousy enough.
I don't care so much about myselt... but I'm my mother's sole support.
I've wasted every cent my father lett Mama...
It's not your tault. Your mother wants you to be a songwriter.
You can make a good living as a biochemist.
That's a wonderful profession, but Mama wants...
Just because she was once in vaudeville... doesn't mean you belong in show business.
Confidentially, I respect my mother, but I do what I want.
Well, Mama's sensitive.
When I upset her, she faints.
Why, with your ideas, you can make a tortune in chemistry.
Chemistry.
Chemistry. Chemistry?
You sound like Rosie.
- Where is she? Where's Rosie?
- Oh, she phoned.
She heard about Birdie being dratted.
She's going to see Ed Sullivan.
Sure, to get another job.
Oh, a fine secretary!
Why, we have been practically engaged, just waiting tor an okay trom Mama.
Now when I hit bottom,
Rosie deserts me.
Quits betore my body's even warm.
Ed Sullivan!
Would you send in
Rosie DeLeon, please?
Is it yes, Mr. Sullivan?
It's just got to be yes.
- Rosie, it is yes.
- Oh, hallelujah!
Oh, I love you. Oh, that's marvelous.
Oh, I love you too! I'm so glad!
Miss DeLeon, I'd like you to meet our producer, Bob Precht.
- Oh, hi. How are you?
- Well, it's my pleasure.
If you can overcome your shyness, tell me... what's our using Birdie on the show got to do with you?
Let's face it,
I'm a scheming woman.
I have a promotion idea that'll knock you out.
It you buy it,
I want a little tavor.
All right.
Let's try it on for size.
How'd you like a territic buildup betore the show... that'll have every TV set tuned into you next Sunday?
We will have. After all, we've got the Moscow Ballet and Birdie.
- This is bigger.
- Bigger?
Betore Conrad Birdie goes into the army... he bestows a farewell kiss on all the swooning girls... who worship him on your TV show.
Atter all, it's only an hour show, and Birdie only gets four minutes.
He kisses them all symbolically.
- What'd you say?
- Symbolically.
- Actually, he'll only kiss one girl.
- He kisses only one girl?
Can't you see it? Birdie, their idol, their leader... kissing one tabulously lucky teenage Tessie?
- Yeah! Yeah!
- It'll melt every bobby pin in America.
It's gigantic. The newspapers will eat it up. Think of the advance publicity.
Get the Birdie's fan club file right away.
- Get us a girl trom Ohio.
- Gotcha!
We'll do it from the outdoor theater,
Columbus, Ohio, right after the ballet.
- I'll get the girl.
- The network will handle the details.
And atter the kiss,
Birdie sings a big song.
- That's where Rosie gets her payoff.
- I don't get it.
- The song is "One Last Kiss."
- Never heard of it.
- Hasn't been written yet.
- Who is going to write this classic?
Oh, who else, but my tuture husband,
Mr. Albert F. Peterson?
Birdie's been wanting to give Albert a break tor six years.
I know he'll use the song, if you say so.
Any song will do even though it's written by your ever-lovin' Albert.
Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.
With a plug like this, that song will sell a million records.
- Man, what royalties!
- We can sure use the money.
Any day now Albert and I will have another mouth to teed.
Rosie, you're not even married yet.
His mother! Bye.
Carmine, get me the publicity department right away.
This batch will do. Get them ready for mailing right away.
Oh, hi, Marge. I need one of your fans trom Ohio.
You can have them all.
Try file number six.
Okay. Six, here we go.
I'm about to make some gaga little goof a queen.
Hey, cute.
Long distance? I want Miss Kim McAfee,
Sweet Apple, 135, Sweet Apple, Ohio.
Marge, isn't it amazing what a woman has to do to get a man to marry her?
You mean you doped
Albert's mother?
No, but if this doesn't work, that's my next move.
What, Operator?
Oh, the line's busy.
Never mind. I'll try later.
Thank you.
Oh, Marge, right now there's a kid named Kim McAtee in Sweet Apple, Ohio... gabbing on the telephone.
Little does she realize
I'm about to make her immortal.
- Hello?
- Hello, Urse. This is Kim.
It I don't tell somebody,
I'm just gonna burst.
So, Ursula, you are the very tirst to know.
I just got pinned by Hugo Peabody.
Oh, no! Kim McAfee, you didn't!
You really got pinned?
You mean you and Hugo have a permanent understanding?
Uh-huh. Oh, it's Hugo and I forever.
Crazy! Crazy!
Tell me, Kim, how do you absolutely feel... in your deepest secret soul?
It's like...
It's like I've been reborn.
It's like all of my lite until this very moment I was nothing.
Kim, I must use the phone.
I've got to call Grandma.
In a second, Mom.
Hey, listen, Ursula.
I'm gonna have to get off.
Where was I?
- You were nothing.
- Oh, yeah.
And now I'm alive, tultilled.
Now I know what it means to be a woman.
It should only happen to me.
Kim, where did he pin you?
On the backseat. Oh, bless that lovely yellow school bus.
- Kim, hurry, please.
- Hang up, so I can spread the word.
Okay, bye, Urse.
- Hi, Nancy
- Hi, Ursula
What's the story, morning glory
What's the tale, nightingale
Did you hear about Hugo and Kim

Poor Pidge. He'll starve.
Here, Pidge. Here, Pidgie.
Here, boy.
Don't jump! Don't jump!
Albert, it's all right!
Everything's all right!
Come on back! Don't worry.
Honey, come on.
- Thank heavens I got here in time.
- You almost pushed me out.
It's all right.
I just came trom Ed Sullivan's otfice.
- Sullivan?
- Yes, Ed Sullivan.
Go to work for Sullivan. Leap from the sinking ship while the house is on fire.
But hear this, Miss DeLeon.
I was loyal.
All the years I employed you, I never looked tor a job behind your back.
- I went to Ed Sullivan's otfice...
- Don't explain.
You owe me nothing, even though you were molded by me.
- Molded?
- Like Eliza Doolittle from Pygmalion.
- I was molded?
- What were you when I tound you?
Hostess at La Casa Enchilada
Taco and Tamale Shop.
Well, sorry I interrupted you.
A man of my ilk does not commit suicide.
I've had just about enough of your kind ot ilks too.
Suicide is for cowards.
I don't desert the woman I love.
Oh, Albert, I'm sorry.
- I should have known.
- Mama would never get over it.
Mama?
What's the matter?
I'm the prize dope ot all time... thinking I could pry you away from your mama's ever-lovin' tentacles.
I will thank you to leave my mother out of this.
- Maybe she does influence me slightly.
- Slightly?
- She is old and frail.
- Which I will be, too, at this rate.
I don't blame you.
I was living in fantasy... telling myselt you were serious.
Oh, Rosie, I was.
I am. In here.
I've thought and thought about marrying you... every day, a lot of nights too.
I've spent six years on Project Albert.
Well, now I haven't got the right.
I can't otfer you security.
A wonderful girl like you... you deserve more trom a husband than just personality and good looks.
But I'll always love you, Rosie.
You'd better always love me, you nut... because you're stuck with me.
Now, you've always worried about repaying your mother, right?
Well, trom now on, she'll be set for lite.
She can sit around on her big tat trust fund. We'll have our own little house...
I don't care what Sullivan pays you.
No woman is supporting Albert Peterson.
- You're not listening, darling.
- I am not a gigolo.
Will you get to that piano and start composing?
- Mary, I want Kim McAtee, Ohio.
- I'm through composing.
I was always through, but now I know it.
That's right. You're a biochemist, but this is one song you can sell.
- Huh?
- Okay, call me back.
- As I was saying, huh?
- Gee, you're slow today.
Now, you are going to write a song called "One Last Kiss."
Is this Albert's floor or is it the one below?
"One Last Kiss." Now.
Oh, one last kiss
There never was such bliss
I love your dentifrice
- A little too clinical, I think.
- Yeah, you're right, honey. Let's see.
Mama? She's never been to the otfice since she discovered canasta.
Well, now's the perfect time to tell her about dissolving Almaelou.
Yeah.
- And about us.
- Yeah.
Sonny!
- Mama!
- Baby!
What a nice surprise, and you're just in time tor some wondertul news.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, son.
I just tainted in the subway.
That's all.
But I didn't tall down.
It was too crowded.
- I keep tellin' ya, take a taxi.
- Taxis?
Taxis are for my successful son.
A dirty crowded subway is good enough for a mother.
Mother's nothin' nowadays.
- Who's that?
- Mommy, you know Rose DeLeon.
- And guess what.
- This is that pretty Rose DeLeon?
Oh, I don't believe it.
Rose, what happened to ya?
You had a fatal sickness or somethin'?
It's nice to see you again.
Always on the job.
She's a credit to the firm.
Look at her, son.
I wonder some older man hasn't snatched her away.
Personable matron.
- Speaking ot marriage.
- A wonderful institution.
Your poor father and I...
That was a marriage.
May he rest in peace.
Don't worry, Lou.
- Our only child is taking care ot me.
- Tell her.
He'd never do anything to break my heart. What about marriage?
It it was good enough for you and Papa, it's good enough...
In time. You're just a baby.
Hello. Yes, Operator.
I'll hold on.
And another thing, Mama,
I'm thinking of dissolving Almaelou.
Wait, Lou. I'm comin'.
I'll be right up there.
We can play canasta again.
Mama? Mama, forget it.
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
- Good-bye, sonny.
Take care of yourself.
Think of me on Mother's Day.
- Good-bye, Rosie.
- Good-bye, Mae.
Call me Mrs. Peterson.
Wear your rubbers.
That's right, Operator.
Miss Kim McAfee.
I'll tell her, Rosie, tonight.
It's entirely up to you, Albert.
The line is still busy?
Yes, Hugo.
Well, of course
I'll always wear it on everything.
Oh, except my gym blouse.
Miss Turgnisht won't allow it.
Tonight?
Well, I have no plans.
I think I can get out till about 10:00.
Oh, you have to be in by 9:00.
Well, c'est la vie.
Until tonight then, mon amour.
Bye.
When you're a skinny child of 15
Wired with braces from ear to ear
You doubt that you will ever be appealing
Then, hallelu jah, you are 16 and the braces disappear
And your skin is smooth and clear
And you have that happy grown-up
Female feeling
How lovely to be a woman
The wait was well worthwhile
How lovely to wear mascara
And smile a woman's smile
How lovely to have a figure
That's round instead of flat
Whenever you hear boys whistle
You're what they're whistling at
It's wonderful to feel
The way a woman feels
It gives you such a glow just to know
You're wearing lipstick and heels
How lovely to be a woman
And have one job to do
To pick out a boy and train him
And then when you are through
You've made him the man you want him
To be
How lovely to be a woman
Like me
How wonderful to know
The things a woman knows
How marvelous to wait for a date
In simply beautiful clothes
How lovely to be a woman
And change from boys to men
To go to a fancy nightclub
And stay out after 10:00
How lovely to be so grown up
And free
Life's lovely when you're a woman
Like me
Hello? Oh? Well, hold on, Operator.
Kim, it's for you.
She says it's long distance.
- Thank you, Doris.
- Who could be calling Kim...
- Did you say "Doris"?
- It's the modern way, dear.
Makes mother and daughter more like friends.
Harry, I think you took the news about Hugo and I awtully well. Hello?
- She called you "Harry."
- Yeah.
- Yes, this is Miss Kim McAfee.
- Yesterday I was a mother.
- Today I'm a friend.
- Yes, I'll hold on.
Well, maybe you could call me Mom.
That's modern.
Times are changing. You go along or else you're out ot it.
Harry, do you have a cigarette?
I've run out.
Oh, so have I.
How about my pipe?
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Kim McAfee? I have a great prize.
- Harry? Kids.
You have been selected from all the teenagers in the United States... to be kissed by Conrad Birdie on
The Ed Sullivan Show this Sunday night.
We'll be in touch. Good-bye!
Conrad Birdie?
To kiss me?
Mother!
- Mommy!
- Baby! What happened?
Conrad Birdie's coming here to kiss me!
- Isn't that nice?
- You don't understand!
Conrad Birdie's coming to Sweet Apple to kiss me!
Oh, Mommy!
I never thought I'd say it, but God bless Conrad Birdie!
Conrad Birdie's coming here to kiss me!
Now, listen. Now, the absolute instant he appears... now I'll introduce Kim to him.
Then we'll all recite our pledge of everlasting loyalty.
The plane!
The plane's almost landed!
We love you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do
We love you, Conrad and we'll be true
When you're not near us we're blue
Oh, Conrad, we love you
We hate you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do
We don't hate anyone as much as you
Your singing makes us say, P.U.
Oh, Conrad, we hate you
We love you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do
We don't hate anyone as much as you
When you're not near us we're blue
- We love you

Hugo wants to talk to Kim.
That's if it's okay with Kim.
- Certainly, Hugo.
- Well, Kim...
Yes?
Hugo, what do you want?
Gee, Kim, the tellows are makin' me do this.
But just the same, they're right.
Kim, you can't go through with this.
Hugo, please be mature.
Doesn't gettin' pinned mean anything these days?
It means everything.
It's sacred.
Well, then how can you let another man kiss you and in public?
- I assure you I won't even feel it.
- Huh?
- I'm just a symbol.
- A symbol?
Don't you see?
This is bigger than us.
Why, all this publicity for Sweet Apple.
Thousands of people will move here.
We'll have a population explosion.
And just think what this will do for your father's undertaking business.
- Hey, yeah, you're right.
- Yeah.
But you really don't go tor that Birdie creep, do you?
What do my eyes tell you?
No, you don't.
I can see you're all mine.
Forever... starting right atter
The Ed Sullivan Show on Sunday night.
Right atter The Ed Sullivan Show on Sunday night.
Hey, we'll be late!
One, two, three!
We love you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do
We love you, Conrad and we'll be true
When you're not near us we're blue
Well, I told her otf, guys.
- She knows where I stand.
- But she's leaving.
- That's to make the population explode.
- Anyone tor the reception, kids?
Gee, Mr. Paisley, we think you're okay even if you are the English teacher.
It should be a tascinating experience.
- Yeah, but are you with them?
- "With them?"
Yeah, that Birdie creep...
He's poisoned our women.
It's bad enough the mayor's a fink, but you, Mr. Paisley...
Well, you see, fellows, as a teacher and a brand-new American citizen... with an unquenchable thirst tor knowledge...
I feel I should witness this unique sociological phenomenon, hmm?
Yeah, guys, suppose
I do let Kim kiss him?
I only want to see a unique so... so... phenomenon.
- Hugo, the fink!
- So long, fink!
- Fink!
- Oh, what a tink!
Here are the gentlemen trom the press.
I'll handle them. You go tind the mayor.
We want him! We want him!
Here's your speech.
Learn it and hurry!
We want him! We want him!
- Look this way, please.
- What's your name?
- Conrad Birdie.
- No, no, your name.
She doesn't even know her name.
"We want him!"
I beg your pardon.
May I add a welcome from Sweet Apple?
I'm Claude Paisley.
Kim McAfee's my student in English.
- How do you do? I'm Rose DeLeon.
- Nice to know you.
- And you're?
- Hugo.
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.
- Hugo Fink.
- Hello, Mr. Fink. How are you?
Now, please don't think me forward.
But it you do have any spare time during your visit...
I'd appreciate discussing
Mr. Birdie with you.
Well, I'm afraid
I'll be very busy... but thank you.
Watch it, Rube.
Don't bend the fur.
He's coming! Look, everybody!
He's coming! Here he comes!
We love you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do
We love you, Conrad and we'll be true
When you're not near us we're blue
Oh, Conrad, we love you
Betore you hear from the girl upon whom... you have chosen to bestow your final kiss upon... we will now recite the Conrad Birdie pledge.
I, being ot sound mind and body... do hereby promise... to be loyal, courteous, steadtast and true... to Conrad Birdie and the United States of America... both indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
As the tortunate girl whom you have selected... to represent all my fellow girls,
I welcome you.
Now, Mayor, now.
Speech here.
And now I present this key to our city to our honored guest...
Conrad Birdie.
He said it!
He said the name!
What happened?
All I said was Conrad Birdie.
Girls, you're going to have to stop that or I can't finish my speech.
Who cares about your speech?
We want to hear Conrad!
He's not so much.
You gotta be sincere
Edna, what's wrong?
You gotta be sincere
Birdie, what are you doin'?
You gotta feel it here
'Cause if you feel it here
Well, then you're gonna be
Honestly sincere
If what you feel is true
You really feel it
You make them feel it too
Write this down now
You gotta be sincere
Honestly sincere
Man, you've gotta be
Sincere
If you're really sincere
If you're really sincere
If you feel it in here then it's gotta be right
Oh, baby
Oh, honey
Hug me
Ah, suffer
In everything I do
Why, my sincerity shows through
Yeah, when I look you in the eye
I don't even have to try
It's automatic
I'm sincere
When I sing about a tree
Listen, why
I really feel that tree
Yeah, when I sing about a girl
I really feel that girl
I mean, I really feel
Sincere
Why, if you're really sincere
If you're really sincere
If you feel it in here then it's gotta be right
Oh, baby

Ah, suffer
Yeah, here we go now
Why, you gotta be sincere
Oh, you gotta feel it here
Oh, my baby, oh, my baby

Are you gonna be sincere
Yeah
We love you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do
We love you, Conrad
And we'll be true
When you're not near us
We're blue
Oh, Conrad, we love you
Randolph, your father's warned you.
It you make another bomb, you'll get spanked.
- It was an accident, Mom.
- Now, get this stuft out ot here.
Doris! Doris!
Doris, what's going on here?
Harry, where have you been since supper?
In plenty of trouble, that's where.
But I'm not now. No, sirree.
You kids go home before
I sick the constable on ya!
Go on! Get that carnival oft my front lawn!
I'll show them who's boss.
Harry McAtee's not going to be pushed around by any roll and rocker.
- Harry, they'll hear you.
- Let 'em hear me!
- Put those chemicals away and go to bed.
- Yes, Papa.
We're in trouble.
He can't stand Conrad living here.
Especially around his pretty young daughter.
She's still under the magic spell.
Dear little Conrad certainly has a devastating impact.
He might make a territic soldier.
Turn him loose and the enemy will twitch itselt to death.
I don't care.
I've changed my mind.
My daughter is not going to be publicly kissed by that... that wiggler.
The deal is ott.
But, dear, you know these adolescents.
Kim will lose tace.
It I don't get rid of that Birdie, that's not all she'll...
Hear this. I have decided that bunch of grafters is getting out ot here.
That is the unshakable decree that
I have made as head of this household.
- So you go upstairs and tell them.
- Me?
How can I tell Mr. Peterson and that nice Miss DeLeon?
Nice? I know that show business crowd... probably living in sin.
Harry Lionel McAtee!
I never told you, but one summer
I worked tor the circus.
- Oh, those midgets, wild.
- Not another word.
She's been engaged to Peterson tor six years. Don't tell me they...
- We were engaged for tive years.
- He's not as stupid as I was.
- Are you stupid, Pop?
- Find out for yourselt!
That's the trouble with kids today! Lazy!
Will you go up? Get up to bed!
Oh, Harry, they'll be gone day atter tomorrow.
I'm a peace-loving man, a good father and husband.
And the result?
The home I hewed out of this wilderness with my bare hands is no longer mine.
Tonight I had to wait until 6:00 tor my supper.
And that Peterson grafter, running up my phone bill with long-distance calls!
- He oftered to reimburse you.
- I don't take Diners Club cards!
Then that snake in a gold suit insists on parking in my beautiful living room.
- Do you know where I've just been?
- No, dear.
To a meeting with the big boys,
Kelsey, Judge Blanch, Joe Kipp.
My biggest customers. They don't approve ot this kind ot notorious goings-on.
Darling, they put pressure on you?
If I don't cancel this whole Birdie deal, they'll starve me out of business.
- Oh, my heavens!
- It's them or us.
- What happened?
- Are you all right?
- What's wrong?
- It was just Randolph's chemicals.
No, a mixture ot iron sultide plus two parts H2SO4.
Smart boy you have there. It isn't every lad who can make a stench bomb.
- Which brings me to Mr. Birdie.
- Mr. Peterson is really a biochemist.
- I couldn't care less.
- I have one tormula, a secret.
It's miraculous because it increases the work output of domestic animals.
- Now about this Birdie.
- It speeds up the reflexes.
An ox, for instance, could outrun a racehorse.
By adding in his tormula, a hen will lay three eggs a day.
Three eggs a day? It that's so, you could make a million times...
I've been nursing this compound for years.
- Still needs more tests, but it works.
- Aren't you in farming?
- He's McAtee Fertilizer.
- Oh, yes.
- Been in it tor 20 years.
- Really?
But I may be out if...
It you and Albert got together, you could revolutionize farm production.
Would you like a demonstration?
Do you have a hen?
- How about trying it on that?
- A tortoise? I don't know.
Sure! It won't bite.
Here. Let me.
Ot course, there isn't much demand for turtle eggs.
But if it really works on tarm animals... maybe you and me could do some business.
I'll sure need something it I let Kim go through with this Birdie stutf.
Some of Harry's customers are against it.
Yeah, and so I've decided it's absolutely out of the question.
Your neighbors are just going to be thrilled... when they see the two of you on The Ed Sullivan Show.
The Ed Sullivan Show.
- We were saving that as a surprise.
- Yes, a surprise.
Me on Ed Sullivan?
Oh, I'd die. What would I wear?
- We'll find something.
- Gee, Ed Sullivan.
He's my favorite human.
That's why I decided to let Kim go on in the first place.
Me on The Ed Sullivan Show?
Ed Sullivan
Me, Harry McAfee appearing with
Ed Sullivan
We're gonna be on Ed Sullivan
How could any family be
Half as fortunate as we
We'll be coast to coast
With our favorite host
We're gonna be on Ed Sullivan
I've got a wonderful wife
Two swell kids a good business and now this
Someday we'll recall
The greatest day of all
Ed, I love you.
Hello?
Oh, yes. Harry, it's the mayor. He sounds mad.
I'II handle this.
Yes? Yes, Mayor?
Yes, the boys talked to me.
Yep, I've decided.
Birdie stays right here... and Kim's on TV.
And what's more...
I'm gonna be on the show, too, with Eddy Sullivan.
Now, listen, Harry. You saw what that crazy galoot did at the reception.
It was a disgrace.
Look, Mayor, you're gonna be on TV too.
They want you to make a speech.
They want me on Ed Sullivan?
A short speech.
Why, sure!
I could become a statewide tace.
It's a deal, Mayor.
Sure I'll plug you up tor governor.
Bye, Sam.
What a hambo.
Well, it's been a long day, so I think we'll...
I'm thinking of calling them "Speed Up."
You like it, Mr. McAfee?
"Feed up with Speed Up."
I love it, partner.
- How will Randolph catch his tortoise?
- Just give him one of these.
Hi, Mr. McAfee.
Gee, I just wanted to thank you.
My dad said you're not letting Kim go on TV and kiss that... that.
It can't be true. You wouldn't destroy Kim, your own tlesh and blood!
Sure he would.
A tather has a right, right?
Hugo, my daughter's old enough to make her own decisions... so I've decided to let her do it.
Well, in that case, your daughter is the tormer future Mrs. Hugo Peabody.
Oh, Hugo, stop acting like a child.
Kim! Where is he?
Can I see him?
Conrad's asleep, poor dear.
You may peek through his keyhole while I... while I discuss this tempest in a tea bag with Hugo.
You're lucky people.
What'd we ever do to deserve such a daughter?
We got married.
Marriage.
- But, Kim...
- Hugo...
- Yeah, but, Kim...
- I don't have time tor a debate.
Ursula's waiting. I've got to learn my speech tor tomorrow's rehearsal.
Wait a minute, Kim.
Don't go yet, please.
You don't know what I've been through with all the guys buggin' me... well, about you and that Birdie creep.
Oh, that.
Yeah, that!
Why, that's silly.
He means nothing to me.
One boy
One special boy
One boy to go with
To talk with and walk with
One boy
That's the way it should be
Yeah, yeah, that's the way it should be.
One boy
One certain boy
One boy to laugh with
To joke with, have Coke with
One boy
Not two or three
One day
You'll find out
This is what life is all about
You need
Someone who
Is living
Just for you
One boy
One steady boy
One boy to be with
Forever and ever
One boy
That's the way it should be
That's the way
It should be
Now is that the kiss of a woman interested in any other man?
I don't know.
How do I tell?
- Ah, but he made you taint.
- Oh, he did not!
I was just exhausted, cramming for my English exam.
You've got to try to understand me as a woman.
Now, I might like
Conrad as a friend... but when it comes to the real thing... the grand passion... well, that's something special, Hugo.
That's you.
One day you'll find out
This is what life is all about
You need someone who
Is living just for you
One boy, one steady boy
One boy to be with
Forever and ever
One boy
That's the way it should be
That's the way
It should be
Homework!
Hey, I got homework to do.
When will he find out
This is what life is all about
Will he ever see
I need him
And he
Needs me
- One boy
- One special boy
- One special boy
- One boy to be with always
One boy to be with
- Forever and ever
- Forever
- I love him
- One boy
- Love him, I love
- That's the way
- Him so
- It should be
That's the way
It should be
That's the way
It should be
Hello, Sweet Apple Drive-in?
I'm looking tor my mother,
Mrs. Peterson.
Are you sure there's no one left in your drive-in? Okay, thank you.
Don't worry, partner.
Your mother will get along tine.
Sweet Apple's full ot friendly folk.
It anything happens to her,
I'll never forgive myself.
- What kind of a dump is this?
- "Dump"?
Conrad. Let's humor him, partner.
If he walks otf the Sullivan show, we're sunk.
Gotcha.
I can't tind no church key in my room.
Church key? We've had a church here, but it's open.
A can opener, man.
You're from nowherelike.
That's my tavorite brand.
Well, it's bedtime, huh, Conrad?
Okay for tonight, but tomorrow's Saturday... and that's my real tense night.
Thanks, Mr. McAtee.
The next time I have a daughter,
I hope it's a boy.
I am a lucky man though, Albert.
Meeting up with a biochemical wizard.
Peterson and McAfee are going right to the moon.
I've got to, not just tor my mother, for Rosie.
Well, I guess I'll get a little air and turn in.
Take all the air you want, chum.
Hi, Rosie.
Rosie, you don't have to worry about Mama. She'll show up.
- I'm certain she will.
- Then you ought to be happy.
Kim's on the show.
Conrad does my song... and I promise
I'll tell Mama about us.
Come on.
Why look so awfully tragic
Put on a happy face
Smiling can work like magic
Put on a happy face
Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy
It's not your style
You look so good that you'll be glad ya decided to smile
Pick out a pleasant outlook
Stick out that noble chin
Wipe off the full of doubt look
Slap on a happy grin
And spread sunshine all over the place
Just put on a happy face
Flowers?
Put on a happy face
Put on a happy face
Why do you mope around so sourly
It's such a strain
I always try to chuckle hourly
It clears the brain
I knew a girl so gloomy
She'd never laugh or sing
She wouldn't listen to me
Now she's a mean old thing
So spread sunshine
All over the place
Put on a happy
So put on a happy
Face
Well, like I said, you're a genius, Dr. Peterson.
Oh, honey, you sure have put up with a lot.
But this time we're gonna make it!
Let's live in a small town like this.
- Anything you say, dear.
- Okay?
Wow, the last time we were alone together... last summer at Palisades Park.
- We went through the tunnel ot love.
- Your mother sat between us.
Oh, honey, I told you. From now on, things are gonna be ditferent.
- Yoo-hoo! Albert!
- It's Mama.
Mama?
Boy meets girl, boy loses girl... boy gets mother.
- Mama, where have ya been?
- Neglected! That's where I've been.
I tried to tind ya.
Have you had any dinner?
A mother doesn't need tood. Besides,
I'd rather be with my famous son.
Albert, what is it?
Oh, it's your mother.
- Oh, good evening!
- How are ya, ma'am?
How can I be... ripped trom my native land, alone in this jungle?
Gosh, Albert, I wish we had room to put up your mother.
Thanks. A motel mattress full of lumps is good enough tor me.
Comtort is tor my loving son.
I just came to tuck ya into bed.
See, Mama's got a condition.
She won't tell me what it is.
Why worry a growing boy?
Okay. You insist?
I got, maybe, one tenth a normal heart.
A mother doesn't need a heart.
Well, soon as Albert and I get our new deal a-rollin'... you'll have the finest doctors in the country.
Deal? What deal, Albert?
Well, Mama, I'm quitting the music business and goin' back to chemistry.
That Rosie!
She's finally turned you against me!
Oh, please, Mama. She didn't.
Albert, go... desert me.
But when I was expecting him in the maternity ward... three days I waited... did I desert him?
No. I stayed right there so he wouldn't be alone when he was born.
Mama, please don't excite yourself.
Mama, you know I love ya.
- It's just Rosie and I have plans.
- Okay!
Lou, I'll be right up.
Start dealing.
Just bury me on your tront lawn so Rosie can walk all over me!
Mama! Mama, please!
It's not gas. It's electric.
Doris!
Doris, how do you like it?
Isn't it exciting?
No! I told you not to dye your hair!
Oh, but I wanted to!
Isn't it a gas?
- You dare dety your mother?
- But it's my hair.
- Not till you're 21.
- What's the matter, Papa?
Young lady, you stay in your room till it changes back! Do you hear?
- I won't!
- I demand respect around here.
- It's my hair!
- Respect. Do you hear? Respect.
- I respect you, Papa.
- I don't want your respect.
Who wants respect trom a ten-year-old kid?
Kids, I don't know what's wrong with these kids today
Kids, who can understand anything they say
Kids, they are disobedient disrespectful oafs
Noisy, crazy, sloppy, lazy loafers
And while we're on the sub ject, kids
You can talk and talk till your face is blue
Kids, but they still do just what they want to do
Why can't they be like we were
Perfect in every way
What's the matter with kids today
Kids, I've tried to raise you the best I could
Kids, all the things I've done were for your own good
Kids, can't you once appreciate how I've sacrificed
Working, slaving, scrimping saving pennies
And livin' with your father, kids
No one knows the burdens I've had to bear, and in my condition
Kids, I'm a poor, sick woman and does he care
Ha!
Go on, go on and kill me
That's what it's coming to
When a mother has kids like you
- Kids
- All the chicken soup I made for you
- Mama, take it easy.
- Kids
- Now you throw me out like a worn shoe
- Not in front of everybody.
Mom, after all, I haven't been such an awful son
I never sass you back or leave a ring around the bathtub
- And don't I always phone you
- Kids
You can give your life to 'em night and day
- Kids, then they go get married
- Married?
- And go away
- Who's gettin' married?
Why do we have these children
Better to have a pet
You know where you stand with a pet.
I never asked for nothin'
Nothin' is what you'll get
What's the matter with kids to...
I tried, Lou, but I failed.
Oh, ya didn't, Mama.
Ya didn't.
Don't try to pay me back, sonny.
I forgive you.
So what if you're an ingrate?
So long as you're happy.
- I don't want to be happy.
- Don't feel guilty.
Just make believe I'm an old used car.
Junk me. Leave me in the gutter.
- I'll never leave ya. Never.
- You heard him.
- You're a witness.
- I promise, Mama.
- I never broke promise to my mama.
- Good boy.
Why can't they be like Albert
Perfect in every way
What's the matter with kids
Yeah, what's the matter with kids
Nothing's the matter with kids today
Mr. Paisley, this is Rose DeLeon.
You asked me to call it I had any tree time.
Well, I'm free.
- Very tree.
- Rosie!
Ten minutes?
I'll be waiting tor you.
Don't worry, sonny.
You can always get another secretary.
Can you see him?
- No. Babette, can you see him?
- I can't see him.
All I can see is the basketball hoop.
Hey, Gretch, can you see him?
Conrad Birdie in our gym!
Oh, oh, oh, give me one last kiss
One last kiss
Oh, one more time
Mmm, baby, one more time
It really is sublime
Ah, baby, so sublime
You know I need your love
Oh, oh, oh, give me one last kiss
One last kiss
Baby
Give me one last kiss
Baby
Give me one last kiss
Oh, one last kiss
Give me one last kiss
It never felt like this
Nah, baby, not like this
You know I need your love
- Oh, oh, oh
- Okay. Cut.
We'll rehearse the song later, Conrad.
- Al, what's the exact length?
- Oh, uh, 1:20.
Check. That gives us 2:40 for Sullivan's intro to Kim...
Kim's good luck speech to Conrad.
Then Conrad socks over a plug tor army enlistments... bangs into the song, and we top it off with the big kisseroo.
- Kim?
- Yes, sir.
Beg pardon, but when do I make my speech?
Speech? What speech?
I promised Mr. McAfee he could say a few words. After all, he's Kim's father.
- Yes, he is.
- Kind of a hello from a proud parent.
All right, but ya can't have much time.
In tact, all you can have is 20 seconds on the nose.
Gotcha. I'll just say a few words, get some big laughs.
- And introduce the mayor.
- The mayor?
- Ah, come on, Al. What is this?
- I... We had a problem.
I had to give the mayor a spot to humor McAfee.
All right, but we'll have to take ten seconds away from McAtee.
I imagine songwriting must be quite a lucrative profession.
- Oh, yes it is.
- How many records will they sell?
Oh, about one or two million.
You know, Claude, I had a pertectly wondertul time last night.
- You really are a wonderful dancer.
- Oh, I don't know.
When one's heart sings, one's feet take wings.
Oh, how lyrical.
Is that Shelley or Keats?
- That, my dear, is Paisley.
- Really?
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, that's wonderful.
- Shall we go?
- Sure.
Okay, everybody. Take your places.
Now come on, Kim.
Just move right over there.
Just read it like you normally would. Okay.
And we, your admirers, are proud that our military leaders have called upon...
- Conrad, honey!
- Please, Mrs. Peterson.
We're rehearsing.
All right now, Kim.
Could you move over one, please?
Kim, you're talking too fast.
Now once more, dear, but slower.
- To express to you...
- Tell me, Mrs. Peterson.
- What does your husband do?
- I don't know. He's dead.
And, and, and I want to say... on behalt of all the girls who are your devoted admirers...
- Oh, I torgot what's next.
- Come on, man. Let's go.
- Hi, Hugo.
- They don't want all this jazz.
- Yeah.
- They want Conrad.
Look. There's the camera.
I bail in, I sing up a storm...
I give this chick the message...
This is my best side.
- Applause.
- She's tainted.
- I'll dig you later.
- Hey, enough! I'm puttin' my foot down!
My baby!
Now I'm puttin' my foot down.
She's not goin' on that show!
Oh, yes, she is.
You're not wreckin' my career.
- Oh, what happened?
- Tell him you're through... because you do not wish to humiliate your steady in this sordid fashion.
Hugo Peabody, you take that back!
I will not, but I will take my pin back.
Oh, with pleasure.
Conrad, I know you're tense, but we haven't tinished.
- The number's not ready.
- Conrad's a trooper, like I was.
- Us troopers get tense.
- Yeah. Like she said, like.
Conrad, why don't you and I go tor a nice ride in the country?
Uh-uh. Man, I hope
I never get that tense.
I never should have said that to Rosie.
- Who does he think he is anyway?
- AI, I got a wire here trom Ed Sullivan.
"Russian Ballet switching to different dance requiring additional four minutes.
Therefore, the entire Birdie spot must be cut to less than 30 seconds."
- Cut?
- "Tell Peterson and Rosie...
I'm sorry song is out, but no choice."
No. They can't do this.
They can't cut the song.
They've already done it, kid. In 30 seconds all Birdie can do is take a bow.
I'm awtully sorry.
The Russians!
First they take Czechoslovakia, and now they take my tour minutes.
- Oh, Mama.
- Oh, baby!
Well, that's, that's show business.
There are chicks just ripe for some kissin'
And I mean to kiss me a few
Man, those chicks don't know what they're missin'
I got a lot of livin' to do
Sizzlin' steaks all ready for tastin'
And there's Cadillacs all shiny and new
Gotta move
'cause time is a-wastin'
I got a lot of livin' to do
There's music to play places to go
People to see
Everything for you and me
Life's a ball if only you know it
And it's all just waitin' for you
You're alive so come on and show it
Yeah, we got a lot of livin' to do
There are men
With childhood behind them
Handsome men
From Yale or Purdue
Older men
And I'm gonna find 'em
I got a lot of livin'
To do
I'm a-gonna have fun
Gonna be wild
Have my own way
I may break
A heart a day
Drink champagne
As if it were water
Pink champagne
And after a few
Daddy dear
You won't know your daughter
She's got a lot of livin'
To do
Think I'll be
A ring-a-ding drummer
Make each week
A thousand or two
Gorgeous girls
Will beg for my number
Hey, I've got a lot of livin' to do
Yes, I'm gonna break out
Gonna take off
Gonna be free
This town is awfully square for a cat like me
Or I'll be
A super jet pilot
Fly me high
Way out in the blue
And then they'll see
I'm no shrinkin' violet
Hey, I've got a lot of livin' to do
I got a lot of livin'
To do
- There's music to play
- Places to go
People to see
Ah, everything for you and me
Life's a ball
If only you know it
Yeah, and it's all just waitin' for you
Oh, you're alive

Yeah, we got a lot of livin'
Such a lot of livin'
Tonight's the night we're gonna fly
Let's kick this hick town into high
I want a taste of everything
Let's live it up and really swing
Got a lot of livin', livin'
Livin', livin'
Livin' to do
Live!
But you needn't bite my head otf.
I only ask a civil question.
Ten times you've asked me.
I don't know why they've changed to this slow dance tor the TV.
But if Albert can't get him to cut it shorter... tomorrow night
I won't be on Ed Sullivan.
Neither will Kim.
You know how much it means to her.
- How about m...
- Well, anyway...
Albert's still in with the managers, so that's a good sign.
If Eisenhower couldn't handle the Russians, how is Albert?
Long live Joseph Stalin.
I mean, Stalin lived too long.
Long live Khrushchev.
Save your lite? Me?
My triend, it you are sick, see a doctor.
If you're sick, see a doctor.
You speak English?
It saves time.
What can I do tor you, uh, Mr. Peterson?
Sir, I have come to appeal to you.
That ballet... the one that you're doing on TV tomorrow night...
Da, for Mr. Ed Sullivan.
Yeah. That's the one.
Could you just cut that four minutes?
Well, it's beautiful. I love it, but my life depends on it.
Desecrate this classic?
I need the time for Conrad Birdie to sing my song.
Who sent you here?
Senator Goldwater?
Will you cut three minutes?
Two minutes?
A minute and a halt.
To cut even ten seconds would be artistic sabotage.
This ballet has historic significance.
It was performed the same day as the tuneral of the czar.
Lenin himself made the arrangement.
- Lenin arranged music?
- No! Funerals!
- Hello, Rose.
- Oh, hi, Kim. You still up?
Oh, I'm so miserable, Rose.
I've lost Hugo, and now I'm not even going to be on TV.
Why not?
The ballet's taking tour extra minutes, so Birdie's song and the kiss are out.
Oh, serves Albert right.
Oh, now come on. Relax.
Faithless men like Albert and Hugo... they're all alike... trom puberty to stupidity... from Benedict Arnold to Mussolini.
Men. We laugh at them, right?
It's easy tor you to pick up the pieces ot your shattered dream.
You've tound a compensation.
Ah, that Claude Paisley is just too much.
He's too much, all right.
But I won't mention of what.
All that charm... so genteel... so educated, so underhanded!
You mean Mr. Paisley's like all the rest?
I thought he was the marrying type.
Oh, he is.
He wanted to elope tonight.
And you know what?
He'd like to live in New York.
Uh, not to teach... to be a songwriter.
A songwriter?
He's all the things
I want to get away trom.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I never dreamed that Mr. Paisley, of all men...
Oh, well. Men.
They're only out to use us, Kim.
I know. Hugo's used me since we were treshman.
All those years I wasted on Albert.
Rosie the dependable one,
Rosie the patient one...
Rosie the good girl.
I know it sounds old-tashioned, but I'm not ashamed to admit it.
- I'm still a good girl.
- Rose?
- Hmm?
- So am I.
No kidding?
Well, you won't be sorry.
- Are you going out so late?
- Mm-hmm.
My farewell to Sweet Apple... a night to remember. I'm going to Maude's Cate.
Maude's? That's a wild place.
You're not gonna do anything rash?
Whatever you hear about me, Kim... just tell them that she loved not wisely, but too well.
This is the place, Albert... hottest spot in the county.
- How do you know?
- Oh, I heard... only heard.
Albert, don't go in that place.
- I must. It's the only way.
- But drinking won't solve anything.
He's frustrated.
Good-bye. Thanks.
I'd go in there with ya it I weren't a happy family man... and not allowed to enjoy myself.
Oh, please, Mister, I...
Oh, my arm!
- I just want to...
- I'm telling you tor the last time!
- All I want is a drink.
- No drinks! Now get lost!
Well, just a pint ot bourbon?
Gin? Scotch?
Well, how about a malted with a little vodka?
Come back when you're 21.
Oh, well, I'm way over 21. I only look young trom too much drinkin'.
Oh, look at me.
Look at the shell of a human being... the monster you've created.
Oh, I'm sorry about... Uh, Hugo, don't worry. You'll get Kim back.
No, thanks.
The bloom is oft the rose.
Rose. Little Rose... a precious flower that I trampled on.
There you go.
A toast to Mae. She's okay.
I'm a songwriter too, huh?
Would you call the McAfee house again and see if my Al... Sonny!
Mama, what are you doin' in a place like this?
We're playin' canasta.
I got lonesome.
- Did you cut the Russians?
- And why are you consorting with him?
- Glad to meet you.
- Now looks ain't everything.
Besides, Mr. Maude is 100% gentlemen and a widower.
Three times. Sit down, Albert.
Any son ot Mae Peterson is a triend of mine. Come. Sit down. Go on.
Mama, get your things. We're taking the bus to New York tonight.
Your song! It's all off?
- It's dead, like I am. Let's go.
- You ain't going, Mae. Say you ain't!
- You unhand her. Come on, Mama.
- Okay, buster. Set 'em up!
Double scotch and gin on the side and, uh, a bourbon chaser.
Make that a triple chaser, and bring on the dancing boys!
Well, come on. Make me the drinks,
Meyer. We gotta put out this tire.
Everything is Rosie
Cha, cha, cha
- 'Cause my name is Rosie
- Oh, the poor thing.
- Fifi, huh
- She can't get over me.
- She's singing the song I wrote tor her.
- You wrote her a song?
Well, only eight bars, Mama.
Somehow I never could tinish it.
Hey, what's with the red cap?
You got a train inside?
Where are you goin'?
I'm gonna go down and see what the boys in the back room will have.
Albert, where are you going?
To save her trom herselt... to save her for me. She might get in trouble.
Report on the charity bazaar we ran for the benetit ot the old tolk home... to wit net cash receipts, $840.06.
Valuable goods contributed, two milk cows, live... eighty lugs ot tresh fruit... forty-five young cumquat trees... one ton of fertilizer...
And now, betore the recording secretary... reads the minutes trom last week's meeting...
I wish to bring up a subject... that I know is on everybody's mind... tonight.
As I was saying, gentlemen...
Yeah!
Yeah!
No. Listen, fellas...
Watch out!
Rosie, baby.
Good morning, darling.
Way past noon. Sleep okay, honey?
Mm-hmm. I tried not to.
I wanted to keep reliving that wonderful moment... when my shining knight... rushed into the sultan's cave... and carried me oft.
Oh, that's just the beginning.
Pack. We're takin' the bus to Niagara Falls.
Oh, yes, dear.
You never saw me in pajamas betore.
You disappointed?
Mm-mm.
Are you?
Let's take a plane to Niagara Falls... a jet!
Albert, we came here to get your mother set tinancially... and our marriage wouldn't have a chance... if we started off feeling guilty about deserting her.
That's right. It may be a long time betore I make any money.
Not if Birdie sang your song tonight.
No chance. I pleaded.
They won't shorten the ballet... not even ten seconds.
It's the slowest dance I ever saw.
They move like turtles.
- What?
- Randolph!
Boys, those are really showstoppers.
Frank, Dean and Sammy, come on out here and take a bow.
Frank, Dean and Sammy McWilliams.
Thank you, boys.
Right now, here on our stage, the magnificent orchestra... of American composer-conductor
Ray Block.
Now, really. Let's hear it.
Well, that ought to do it.
Any questions?
- No, sir. Not at all.
- Okay. I'm going backstage.
Right.
Don't know why I let that Albert drag us here.
Rosie said she might have a big surprise for us.
Maybe they'll show us sitting here on TV. I bet that's it.
- Where did you get all that money?
- I sold Mr. Peterson my chemical set.
- Two minutes, maestro.
- Borov will be there.
Have never been late for performance in whole career.
- You say you from magazine?
- Uh, yes. American Ballet magazine.
We want a picture of the world's greatest conductor, Maestro Borov.
You flatter me.
So, shoot me quick.
Uh, drinking this milk.
- Milk?
- Yes.
We drink vodka, little tlower.
Oh, well, no, thank you.
Please, maestro. This milk.
You see, our president has asked us to drink more milk... and it would be a goodwill gesture.
- President?
- Yes.
Oh, won't you, please, maestro... to improve our relations?
You are pretty enough to be un-American.
All right. Here we go.
Drink up. That's it.
Now keep drinking until I frame you...
Uh, frame you pertectly. All right.
Bottoms up. That's it.
Very good.
You've got it. I mean, gotcha!
See you atter, could be?
- I'll catch up with ya.
- And for you I do not go too fast.
We shall see.
Good-bye. Thank you.
Mission accomplished.
- He drank it?
- Yeah.
My formula works on chickens and Randolph's turtle... but I don't know about humans.
Well, it it doesn't, we're no worse otf... but if it does, this will be the shortest ballet in history.
And now, ready America and Canada?
Because here we go out to Columbus, Ohio... where the Moscow Ballet dances
"The Rose Adagio"... from Tchaikovsky's
Sleeping Beauty... conducted by Maestro Borov.
Take it away, CBS Columbus, Ohio.
We're on. Up on one.
Lights.
Camera two, can you move to your right just a couple of teet?
Magniticent.
It's not gonna work.
This is crazy. That's not the way it was rehearsed.
What is it, sabotage?
We'll have to fill some time.
Put the Birdie song back in.
Gotcha, Ed.
Take over.
Be prepared tor the Birdie spot.
Albert, "One Last Kiss" is back in.
Find Conrad. Rosie, get Kim.
- Right.
- Put the Birdie spot on stage. Let's go!
McAtee, hurry up! Come on.
Let's go. The song is back in!
- A miracle happened! Let's go!
- What? Come on!
Are you crazy, Borov?
I've never seen such speedin' dancers.
Thank you, Moscow Ballet... for that brilliant and unexpected bit of burlesque.
And now, another great treat...
Conrad Birdie.
On behalt of all the members... ot the Sweet Apple chapter of the Conrad Birdie Fan Club...
We wish to express to you... our great pride in your brave deed.
- Hiya, Ed.
- Oh, no.
Oh, hi. How are ya?
I wish to convey our deep pride... in your brave deed, namely...
As a citizen,
I'm proud to have Conrad... defend my family and the McAfee Fertilizer Company.
Conrad, sing!
Oh, one last kiss
Give me one last kiss
It never felt like this
Nah, baby, not like this
You know I need your love
Give me one last kiss
One last kiss
Oh, one more time
Mmm, baby, one more time
It really is sublime
Ah, honey, so sublime
You know I need your love
Give me one last kiss
One last kiss
Baby
Give me one last kiss
Baby
Give me one la...
Yoo-hoo! Albert!
I saw it all on TV.
"One Last Kiss" was a disaster.
Who wants to buy a record of a guy with a glass jaw?
Now will you take Mama's advice and get out of show business?
I am! My song may be dead, but my chemical formula works... on people.
Shh. The Russians may have this place bugged.
It was Albert's formula that made the orchestra leader go that tast.
My genius!
You gotta work on my cleaning woman.
She gets a dollar an hour.
Yeah. Mama...
Rosie and I are going to Niagara Falls.
Well... it's about time.
Oh, Mae!
You have to come with us!
No. I'm one mother doesn't mix in. Maude!
Don't tall in the pit, Maude.
- Albert?
- Yes.
I would like to do things proper.
So I would like the honor of becoming your steptather.
Is it all right, Albert?
Mama, with my blessing!
- I'm glad because we just got married.
- Yes.
- What a surprise!
- How exciting! It's beautitul!
- Congratulations!
- Thank you very much.
Let's go, Maudie!
We're leavin' for Akron.
Hubby has to open a new bar and he wants me to throw out the first beer can.
- Yeah! Good-bye, son!
- The falls are wet. Take your rubbers!
- Bye!
- Yes, Mrs. Maude.
How about that?
Maude and Mrs. Peterson.
- Oh, ready here, Albert.
- Be right with you.
No hurry, partner.
I promise you one thing, snookums.
No matter how many millions I make sellin' "Speed Up"...
I'll still be the same, humble, lovable guy.
And it any ot those hicks try to push me around, I'll break 'em.
Everything is Rosie
Since I found my Rosie
Same old words.
With a girl like Rosie
How could I be blue
Same eight bars. Now what?
Hand in hand, we'll mosey
Me and little Rosie
We will be so cozy
By a fire built for two
Oh, Albert, you're too much.
Oh, I once heard a poem that goes
A rose is a rose is a rose
But I don't agree
Take it from me
There's one rose sweeter than any that grows
And that's my Rosie
I'm so glad she chose me
Life is one sweet
Beautiful song to me
Everything is Hugo
I will go where you'll go
With a boy like Hugo
How could I be blue
We will be so cozy
Just like Al and Rosie
But we're gonna mosey
In a hot rod built for two
- And that's my Rosie
- Gee, how delighted we'll be
- I'm so glad she chose me
- When you are cozy with me
Life is one sweet beautiful song
When love is right then what could be wrong
Life is one sweet
Beautiful song to me
Bye, bye
Birdie
The army's got you now
I'll try
Birdie
To forget somehow
No more
Sighing
Each time you move those lips
No more
Dying
When you twitch those hips
Your swivel and your sway
Your super-duper class
There's nothing left to say
But, Conrad, you're a gas
Bye, bye
Birdie
Ta, ta, ol' sweetie pie
Bye, bye
Birdie
Time for me to fly
Time for me to fly
Time to say good-bye
Bye, now
We're on our way to Nashville,
Been traveling quite a spell.
The road's been mighty bumpy!
Yeah, and I don't feel too well!
We've got to get to Nashville!
Yes, it's really quite a spot!
You're going to like old Nashville.
I still don't feel so hot!
It's Jamboree time!
Jamboree time!
I can hardly wait to meet up with the crowd!
It's Jamboree time!
Jamboree time!
Come on, let me hear it, clear and loud!
We're on our way!
We're on our way!
We're on our way to a swinging Jamboree!
Yeah! We're on our way.
We're on our way!
We're on our way to
Nashville, Tennessee, 000eeee!
Drop it!
It's okay. Sorry you got caught in the middle!
What's goin' on?
- Spies!
- Spies!
That's right! Over in
Acme City, and these hills.
- They're all over the place!
- Let's get out of here!
Jeepers, you have to relax!
You're headed for a nervous breakdown
If you don't unwind a little bit!
Well, don't worry ma'am, they won't bother you,
Uh, unless you're carrying some secrets in this guitar!
- You entertainers?
- Yes, sir.
We're on our way to Nashville.
We're doin' a Jamboree there!
- Well, good luck!
- Thank you.
The road's clear.
You can pass on.
Thank you.
Woody, we have to do something about Jeepers!
Yeah, I know!
He's been working night and day,
And I think his nerves are on edge!
- Jeeps.
- What?
Now Jeepers,
You know we appreciate what you've done for us.
We sure do, Jeep!
And, I realize you've worked awfully hard
To try to get the show lined up
So we could appear back in Nashville.
That's right!
And, the show isn't
- until tomorrow night.
- That's right.
And, Woody and I are going to find a nice,
Quiet, restful place for you.
We'll see that you relax.
Yeah, relax. That's what
Jeepers needs, relax.
Howdy!
Hi! Thought this place was closed!
Well, it should be!
- Nobody ever comes this way!
- Where are we?
- Sleepy Junction.
- Sleepy Junction.
- Where are we?
- Sleepy Junction.
Oh!
Hey Woody! We're in
Sleepy Junction!
Sir, we're looking for a nice, quiet place to spend the night.
- Uh, a motel.
- No.
- A hotel.
- No.
A boarding house?
Ma'am, there just ain't nothin' around here!
What happened to this place?
Everybody moved out!
Moved over to Acme City!
They got a big missile plant there,
And the people go where the work is.
Jeeps, I'm sorry buddy.
But, we'll find a place for you, so you can rest and relax.
Aw, that's okay.
I feel good now.
I'm not nervous or anything.
- Thunder?
- Thunder!
Yeah, it looks like a storm's coming up!
It don't look too good, does it?
Hey! I just thought of something!
There's the old
Beauregard mansion!
Oh, it's quiet alright!
At least you'd get in out of the rain, and have a place to stay!
- Well, where is it?
- Just follow this road.
Thank you.
Hey! Wait!
I forgot to tell
'em it's haunted!
Hurry up! That rain's going to be coming down any minute!
Wait! Listen! Listen!
Jeepers! Come on!
- You're not afraid, are you?
- Oh no!
Well, come on!
What are you two waiting for?
I'm waiting for my courage to come back!
Come on, let's go!
I think my courage just left again!
Oh Jeepers! It's just a shutter that fell!
Listen, I don't like this place one little bit!
Heehaha! Heeha!
I said, put that monkey back in the cage!
- Alright, alright!
- I want him to stay in the cage!
If he comes out once more, once more, I'll kill him!
Oh Anatole, you get in there, be a good boy.
Be a good boy. Ahnananana!
- Be quiet!
- (GORILLA) Ohohoh! Ohohoh!
You shouldn't talk to Anatole like that! He's sensitive!
(GORILLA) Euch!
Euch! Euch! Euch!
Stay away from that monkey!
Well, it's not exactly a Hilton hotel!
Oh!
Jeeps, go get the television set!
- Let's start a fire!
- Okay!
Hey, I'd put the top up on the car, but I know it don't work!
Hey! This is kind of fun, you know? Sorta like camping out!
I'd like to explore this place once we get settled down!
Woody?
There's something out there!
- What?
- Calm down, boy.
Listen, I saw uh, uh, a thing out there!
Jeepers, you're a nervous wreck!
Now you're seeing things!
- I am?
- Boy, you in bad shape!
What you need is to relax!
Now, I want you to know
Jeeps, no matter what happens,
That you've been one of the best
Little business managers anybody could have.
But, you need to unwind!
Come over here and sit down in this comfortable chair,
And just relax man!
That's what I'll do. I gotta relax!
Sing him a song Woody, that always relaxes him!
Alright!
Jeeps, this is one I was telling you about I wrote the other day.
Called uh,
What was the name of that?
Oh, uh, 'Livin' in a Trance'.
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah!
Yeah, let me begin here.
You cast a spell on me,
The first time we met.
Bewitched and enchanted at first glance.
I didn't know then,
The spell that I was in.
Now I'm living in a trance.
Living in a trance.
In a world of lost romance,
I never had a chance.
Living in a trance.
Living in a trance.
Duhhh, duh-deh-duh...
Shhh! He's sleeping like a baby!
Is he asleep, or is he hypnotized?
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Who's there? Wait a minute, I'll see who it is!
Who's there? Come on, speak up, who is it?
- Nobody!
- Well, come on in then!
You a ghost?
Not yet, but, you durn near scared the life out of us!
Me too!
What are you doin' here?
We were just passing by,
And we thought we heard guitar music coming from this place!
Oh! That was me!
You live around here?
Just over the hill.
We figured, if it was a ghost,
It must be friendly if it plays the guitar!
What makes you think it was a ghost?
'Cause, this place is haunted!
Nobody comes near here!
Well, we've been here for quite a while,
And nothing has happened!
Huh! You're one of the lucky ones.
Oh, I don't think nothin' will happen!
Come on in and warm yourselves by the fire.
Okay?
Yup. There's all kinds of strange lights
And strange sounds always comin' on around this place.
Somebody comes in to see if they're real, leaving just like that!
Well, let's leave, just like that!
Oh Jeepers! Don't be a baby!
We haven't heard a thing!
Say! Aren't you
Woody Weatherby?
I'm guilty.
I knew it! He's a big star!
Thank you very much. I'm proud you heard of me!
This is Boots Malone.
- Hi!
- And, my manager, Jeeps.
Heard of you folks, too.
We play and sing a little.
How about singin' one for us?
We'd like to!
I feel like we're auditioning an act!
Well, you never know where you'll find good singers!
There is one song that we sing about this mansion,
And 'Old Tom Cat', one of the ghosts here.
Years ago, this song was made famous in these parts.
Now, old Uncle John had troubles of his own,
He had an old yellow cat that wouldn't leave home.
He tried everything he knew to keep the cat away.
He even gave it to a preacher and told him to stay,
But the cat came back...
The cat came back.
I thought he was a goner, but the cat came back.
'Cause he wouldn't stay away!
Now, he gave the old cat to a man in a balloon.
He told the man to leave him with the man in the moon.
The balloon, it busted, and everybody said,
Ten miles away they picked a man up dead,
But the cat came back.
The cat came back.
I thought he was a goner, but the cat came back,
'Cause he wouldn't stay away.
Bum-de-dum, bum-bum-bum-de-doo
Now the cat was a terror, and they thought it was best,
To give him to a feller that was headed out West.
The train went around a corner, and it hit a broken rail,
Not a soul aboard the train lived to tell the tale,
But the cat came back.
The cat came back.
I thought it was a goner, but the cat came back.
'Cause it wouldn't stay away.
Bum, bum, bum-by-um, bum.
Now the farmer on the corner's gonna kill the cat at sight,
He loaded up his gun with nails and dynamite.
Well, he waited in the garden
'till the cat came around,
And seven little pieces of the man was all they found!
But, the cat came back!
The cat came back!
I thought it was a goner, but the cat came back.
'Cause he wouldn't stay away!
Bum, bum, bum, bu-de-bum.
Bum, bum, bum, bah-bum.
Rrrrrrrarr! Bum!
- Oh wonderful!
- That's fine!
Really, that's good.
Can you sing any love songs?
- Sometimes.
- Would you sing one tonight?
The minute you're gone, I cry.
The minute you're gone, I die.
Before you walk out of sight,
I'm like a child all alone at night.
I stare into emptiness,
I'm filled with such loneliness.
The world goes from right to wrong,
The minute you're gone.
The minute you're gone I see,
How lonely a man I'll be.
My life would be oh so-blue,
If I couldn't be with you.
The minute you're gone,
I pray.
The minute you're gone,
I say,
Please don't stay away too long.
The minute you're gone.
Doo-doo-doo-doo.
The minute you're gone I see,
Oh how lonely a man I'll be.
My life would be oh-so-blue,
If I couldn't be with you.
The minute you're gone, I pray.
The minute you're gone,
I say,
Please don't stay away too long.
The minute you're
Gone, gone, gone.
Gone. Gone.
Oh! That was just wonderful!
(CRACKLING NOISE OF
BONES AND EERIE MUSIC)
Ah!
Why! There's nothing there!
You suppose, maybe it's mass hopitism?
- That's hypnotism!
- That's what I said!
Maybe we've all been working too hard!
Well, I for one, do not believe in ghosts!
And, I think we ought to investigate!
Isn't anyone coming with me?
(CREAK OF STAIRS
AND EERIE MUSIC)
- Arrrrhhh!
- Ahhhh!
Ahhhh!
What was it?
- Didn't you see it?
- See what?
That horrible looking thing!
Are you sure you saw it?
I think so! Oh, I don't know!
I heard a sound, and
I was so frightened!
Look, maybe we better get out of here while we can!
It could've been my imagination!
Well, between the three of us,
There's sure a lot of imaginating going on!
One thing for sure,
There's something funny about this house!
Well, I don't think it's so funny!
And, I'm not laughing at all!
(SOUND OF BONES
KNOCKING TOGETHER)
Oh! Maybe it's an owl!
An owl! Doin' what?
Draggin' a chain to his nest?
Look, I do not believe in ghosts!
And, there must be some explanation for all of this!
Where are you going?
To continue the search!
Look Boots, this is an old empty house.
I know there may be a few ghosts in here,
But I think we've searched long enough!
I think we ought to get out of here myself!
I'm with you!
- Wooodddyy!
- What's wrong now?
- I saw a, uh, uh...
- What? What?
- I don't know what it was!
- Well, I'll go check the car.
Come on!
Poor Jeepers! This isn't a very relaxing place for you, is it?
No!
My dear Dr. Himmel,
We have more important things to settle
Than your concern with that monkey.
- It infuriates me!
- Of course it does!
But, we've little choice in the matter!
I knew from the beginning, that it was a mistake!
That was not your decision to make!
Maximillian is my man!
Yes, of which you so consistently remind us!
From the moment we began this project.
You forget that I am the contact with Dr. Fu! Without me...
Without you, we might be much safer!
Indeed we might!
You've been warned again and again to use the secret entrance
Yet tonight, you walked right into the house
As if you were some neighbor on a social jaunt!
I saw a strange car,
And I decided to make an investigation.
Such foolish investigation endangers the whole project!
No matter what your authority,
You've no right to take such risks,
Especially since we're so close to achieving our goal!
You know perfectly well that we often have visitors
Who are curious to discover if this is really a haunted house.
The simple fact is, that if you had contacted us by radio,
We could have notified you of our visitors.
What is done, is done!
So, we are no longer safe.
You have always known this was not a safe business to be in.
But, tonight is our last night!
It's foolish to endanger the entire project!
Don't worry! Everything is going to be alright!
Bad news.
- Why? What happened?
- The car won't start!
- Oh no!
- Yippee!
Well, I guess we'll just spend the night here.
Jeeps, you can help me build the fire up some.
We'll bake it so it will last until morning.
And, I think we ought to stick real close together.
- Good thinking!
- Boots, I want you to...
Boots?
- Boots? Boots?
- Oh boys!
Here I am.
Come and see what I've found!
Where are you?
What do you mean runnin' off?
Well, I was just down this hall!
Well, we've got to stick together!
- Yeah! We got to tick together!
- I'm sorry!
We don't know what's goin' on in this house!
- Anything could happen!
- Okay!
Come on and see what I found!
When I open this door, you won't believe what's inside!
By now, I'd believe anything!
You're right! I don't believe it!
Isn't it beautiful?
Oh, I could spend forever right in this one little room!
It's so elegant!
Maybe this is the room of the great lady of the house,
That's been kept exactly as she left it!
Way back in the Civil War days, when she was a southern belle!
Gowns! Gowns! Beautiful gowns,
Satin, and lace from across the sea.
Gowns! Gowns! Beautiful gowns,
Bring back a precious memory.
Of summer nights,
Twinkling stars above,
A night so right
For people in love.
As we dance, dance,
I realize,
The gown I was wearing,
Hypnotized.
So I gaily
Danced through the night
In my lovely gown of white.
Loo, loo,
Loo-loo-loo.
Loo-loo-loo-loo,
Loo-loo, loo-loo.
Loo, loo,
Loo-loo-loo.
Loo-loo-loo-loo,
Loo-loo, loo-loo.
A summer night
Twinkling stars above,
A night so right,
For people in love.
As we dance, dance,
I realize,
The gown I was wearing
Hypnotized.
So, I gaily
Danced through the night,
In my lovely gown of white.
Ooh, ooh-loo-loo-loo-loo.
Loo, loo-loo-loo-loo.
Dream girl, we got to get out of here!
Oh, but it's so beautiful!
I could stay here forever!
Well, let's go.
Let me in! Is someone there?
Yes Madam Wong!
There are three of them.
What beautiful trespassers!
Ah, who are you?
I'm Woody Weatherby,
Boots Malone, and Jeepers.
Delighted! Now, tell me what are you doing in my house?
Oh! We didn't know it was your house!
I bought the
Beauregard Mansion,
So that I could restore it to its original beauty.
We didn't mean to trespass!
Well, never mind. Just tell me, what are you doing here!
Well, it looked like a storm was comin' up,
And we needed a place to stay.
Come! Let us leave this room.
Of course, you cannot stay here!
Haven't my ghosts bothered you?
Well...
- Are they real ghosts?
- Of course they are!
I told you we should have gotten out of here!
Ma'am, if you'll just let us spend the night.
You see, we're entertainers,
And we're on our way to
Nashville, Tennessee,
To do a Jamboree there.
And, I'm afraid our car won't start.
And uh, well, we're gonna have to wait until morning.
Tell me, what kind of entertaining do you do?
I'm a singer.
And, I pick a guitar.
How charming.
And, what do you do my dear?
I sing, and dance.
Ah, that's nice, nice.
Are you an entertainer?
Uh, no. Not exactly.
What are you exactly?
I are exactly his business manager.
What's goin' on?
I don't know, but, it looks phony.
They seem real nice to me!
I have decided that, uh, you may stay, at least for tonight.
- Well, fine!
- Let me warn you.
Stay in that room.
You'll be much safer.
We'll stay right by the fireplace.
Good!
We sure do, hey, they've gone!
- Where'd they go?
- They didn't go out that door!
You think, maybe she was a ghost too?
Sure seemed real to me!
Well anyway, she was nice
Letting us stay here and all tonight.
Well, let's settle down and try to get some rest.
All right.
Woody? Hey Woody!
- Hmmmm.
- You asleep?
Eyeah!
Boots? Boots?
Hmmm? What's wrong?
I can't sleep!
Oh, for heaven's sake!
Well, let us sleep anyway!
- For crying out loud, Jeeps!
- Watch T.V. or something!
Yes Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, for a terrific used car buy,
Hurry on down right now to Acme City Sales!
And now, for a full hour of country and western music,
Here's Merle Haggard!
I played a brand new record on the juke box.
And, I scarcely could believe the song I heard.
It told of how you left me for another.
It was almost like I'd written every word.
Someone told my story in a song.
The lyrics told that happiness had gone.
They told of how you done me wrong.
Someone told my story in a song.
The writer must have seen the way you left me,
For he told it all and never missed a line.
He told of swinging doors and a juke box.
He even knew I almost lost my mind.
Someone told my story in a song.
The lyrics told of happiness that's gone.
Then it told of how you'd done me wrong.
Someone told my story in a song.
Now, we give you Jim Kent.
Hi there shoes,
Are you the ones she wore last night?
Was she with him?
Did he hug and hold her tight?
Or, was she just out walking
Like she said,
Down by the sea.
Tell me shoes,
Was she stepping out on me?
Oh say there telephone,
Did he call here and talk to her?
Did he say, he'd meet her
- at their rendezvous.
- Woody?
Woody! Boots?
Did you hear her say,
She couldn't wait
To be with him.
Is that why she wasn't here
To answer you?
Hi there pretty dress.
Are you the one that she would choose?
While I called here,
Were you out with one or with two?
Did he put his arms around you,
As he held her tenderly.
Tell me dress, was she stepping out on me?
Woody?
Woody wake up!
Boots!
- Boots!
- What's going on?
For crying out loud, Jeeps!
Look at the T.V.!
Look at the television!
That's very nice, Jeepers.
Yeah, he picks a mean guitar.
Now, let's go back to sleep!
No! I saw these two weird faces on the television.
Ah hell, you're watchin' the late, late, show!
What late, late show?
Listen, I saw that
Chinese lady and her friend!
- Well, so did I!
- I mean on the television!
Jeepers, you're in bad shape!
You need a long, long, rest!
If you don't stop seeing things,
You're going to end up in the 'funny farm'!
Well, I saw something!
And, it looked like 'em!
Now, I'm hearing things!
They are entertainers.
- Oh really!
- Of course they are!
You take their word unconditionally?
They were carrying guitars, weren't they Matt?
Yeah! Two or three of them!
Anyone can play a guitar!
That doesn't make entertainers!
In fact, it could well be a cover disguise!
I believe, they're from the master organization
To halt enemy resistance!
M.
O.
T.
H.
E.
R.
Oh!
- He's right!
- Oh come now!
They are not 'Mother' agents.
I'll take care of them!
The torture wheel!
The rack! Hehehehe!
And, the iron maiden!
Effective, but primitive!
We have other methods.
Quicker and surer!
No! We must not waste time eliminating three,
Who are obviously nothing more than what they appear!
Then you still think that they're entertainers?
You don't want us even to question them?
I thought we had resolved that problem!
Well, I suppose we must bow to her judgment in this matter.
As long as I am in charge, you must!
I wish I could be as sure of them as you are.
Dr. Himmel will continue to observe them,
While I attempt to contact headquarters.
- Yes?
- Who are you?
Agent Ming Toy.
Thirty-eight, twenty-four, thirty-six.
Oh!
Let me speak to the Chief.
One moment, please.
Good evening, Dr. Fu.
Kreagar, have you the rest of the formula?
No, but Maximillian is leaving
Almost immediately with Madame Wong.
Let him make contact tonight
With the agent at the
Acme City Missile Plant,
At which time they'll receive the balance of the formula.
Excellent.
When we receive the balance of the formula,
We'll report back to you at once.
I will be expecting your call.
Meantime, may I suggest
That you have everything in readiness for the test.
Of course.
Well, now it's up to you.
I suggest that you keep in close radio contact with us.
We will. Come Max.
Anatole, I've got it!
He, he, he.
- Max!
- Huh?
Don't you realize we have important business?
- Yeah.
- Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Gentlemen! This is no time for disagreement.
Max, here's your laboratory smock, your identification card,
- and your badge.
Good luck.
- Yeah.
Woo! Woo!
Hi there! Working kind of late, aren't you?
Yeah.
You scientists really work hard.
Yeah, that's right.
Hey, you're new here, aren't you?
Yeah, sure.
I thought so. I didn't recognize your face. What project you on?
It's top secret. No comment.
Ooooh, that's alright,
I know all about them.
I been workin' here for five years.
The things I know, and the things I've heard,
You wouldn't believe!
I tell you one thing, if anybody wanted to be a spy,
The thing to do is become a janitor.
Janitor knows everything that goes on.
I ain't got time for conversation,
- now, let me by will ya?
- Sure. Sure.
I see you're cleared for top secret.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Hey, that's pretty good.
Of course, I'm cleared for top secret too.
Janitors have to be.
Well, I told you I ain't got time for conversation!
Now, let me by, will ya?
Locked out, huh?
It looks like it.
That's okay. Don't worry, I've got the key.
As long as you're cleared with security.
- Huh, huh, thanks a lot.
- Glad to help.
Hey, uh, ain't you forgettin' something?
Oh, that. Thank ya.
- Are you George?
- Yes.
- Do you have the formula?
- Yes.
Give it to me!
If you'd betray your country, you'd betray us.
Augh!
Oooooh! Owuoh!
Oooh!
No, no, don't try to say anything.
I'll, I'll get help for you.
Yeah, Chief? This is Jim.
My partner's just been shot.
Yeah. You'd better get an ambulance over here right away.
No, he hasn't said anything yet.
I'll follow through. You'd better hurry! Okay, will do.
- Now don't try to say anything.
- Ooh!
- Ooh!
- Take it easy.
The old Beauregard mansion.
Ooh!
The mission is completed.
- Do you have the formula?
- Yes.
That's what we've been waiting for.
I'll be glad to get out of this cold, damp cellar!
We both need a vacation, Kreagar.
- Um-hum, Florida.
- The Caribbean.
- Wait a minute.
Um, Mexico.
- Puerto Vallarta.
Ah, marvelous! Come on.
Let's call the Chief!
Just to let him know our mission was successful,
And we'll be calling with the formula soon.
I don't believe in ghosts.
I don't believe in ghosts.
I don't believe in ghosts.
I don't believe in ghosts.
I forgot about that door.
It looks as though he's waiting for someone.
Or, he may be initiating an investigation,
Whatever Madame may think.
Madame is not always right.
We may be making a grave mistake.
I don't think they're entertainers.
- They're not in costume.
- True. Quite true.
Yes?
It looks like we are being followed.
- Can you lose them?
- Of course we can.
- Are you alright?
- We lost them.
Imagination, that's probably what it was.
I wonder, perhaps we should question one of our visitors.
Hmmm?
What'd you say?
- You awake?
- Awake!
How do expect me to sleep,
With you rollin' around half the night?
Sorry about that chief.
It's a bad sign, Jeeps.
What were you talkin' about?
I don't know. That's the first time I heard it.
Well, when you figure it out, tell me all about it,
When I'm wide awake.
I'm telling you,
There's something goin' on in this house.
Sure, it's your uh...
Well, I can't be imaginating all of this!
I don't know. You've been doin' pretty good at it.
- Now, go back to sleep.
- I can't go to sleep!
You hear that?
That all depends on what it sounds like.
It sounds like somebody's moaning or somethin'.
- Yeah, the wind.
- Oh.
- What's that?
- I don't know. Let me see.
- Shutters?
- I don't think so.
Maybe nothin', huh.
It may be the branches
Hittin' up against the side of the house.
Yeah.
Help! Help me!
Naw, that sounds like somethin'.
- Imagination.
- No, that sounded like...
Boots?
- She's gone!
Well, don't panic!
- I'm not! I'm not!
Don't panic! We would have heard the door by the way it squeaks.
Let's try the hall!
Boots?
Boots?
Where are you, Boots?
Check the closet.
Anything in there?
Just a wierdwolf. A wierdwolf!
- Wait a minute.
- Well, what?
- We can't forget Boots.
- Oh, yeah.
What am I running for?
I didn't see anything!
Come on.
That stupid gorilla!
- (GORILLA MAKES NOISES)
- Oh shut up!
Don't pick on poor old
Anatole all the time!
He's not so bad.
Don't you remember,
I said just now that
We ought to question one of our visitors?
Yes.
Well, he must have heard us talking and he wants to help us.
The only smart thing he's ever done.
Huh, ha, ha, ha.
Jeeps, we've got to separate.
I'll go upstairs. You go outside and look around.
Okay.
- Say, Woody?
- Yeah.
You know, after really thinking about it
For three or four seconds,
Don't you think we ought to stick together?
You're not afraid, are you?
Well, I never won any bravery contest.
Why don't you take that hat off. It might be bad luck.
Oh, okay.
And, I thought the front was bad!
Man, it's spooky out here!
Boots? Ooh! Boots!
Hey, honey.
Boots, where are you?
Well, she's not out here.
- Let's go back in.
- Hold it.
I don't see anything.
Me neither, let's go back!
- They're getting too close!
- Then do something!
Did you hear something?
- Must be wind.
- Yeah, I guess so.
Move the ghost a little closer.
Alright.
Jeeps, I think something's behind us.
- You sure?
- I think so.
- You think we ought to look?
- I'm almost afraid to.
I'll count to three, then we'll both turn and look.
One, two,
Two and-a-half.
Three. Heahhh!
Come on Jeeps, hurry!
Jeeps!
- Jeeps, where'd you go?
- Woody! Help!
What're you doin' down there?
Well, I ain't lookin' for new talent!
They seem thoroughly frightened.
You should get rid of them once and for all.
If it doesn't work, we'll have to take drastic measures.
Should we question the girl now?
Let's wait, at least until Madame returns.
Are you afraid of her?
We're all dependent on each other in this operation.
Hmmm, we could still question her.
George, my dear friend, without Madame Wong,
We get no payment for our services.
I think it's imperative that we wait until she returns.
We could start questioning.
I have no intention
Of jeopardizing our position with Madame.
I suspect she'll be angry enough when she sees the young lady.
- It's not our fault!
- Yeah, I know, the gorilla.
Hey Woody. Man, I'm putting this hat back on!
I wonder where she went to.
Stand right where you are.
I suggest you raise your hands.
Very high. Higher!
- You idiot!
- The gorilla did it!
I told you to leave them alone.
Never-the-less, I decided that we should question one of them.
Perhaps you are right. Hmmm.
Do not scream, dear.
Maximillian has a nervous finger.
Perhaps you'd better answer a few questions!
We don't have time to answer questions.
Our girl singer is missing.
How long have you been contact agents?
The only agents we know get ten percent.
What does that mean?
That means, we're entertainers.
Now look, I've got to find my girl singer.
Hold it! What proof do you have that you're an entertainer?
My guitar?
Play!
Look, that girl may be in trouble!
If you're an entertainer, you can play any time, now go on!
Well, perhaps you are entertainers.
Now, would you mind telling' me what's happening?
Have you ever heard of M.O.T.H.E.R.?
M.O.T.H.E.R., that spells mother!
I know 'Mother McCree', and some other songs about mother.
M.O.T.H.E.R. is,
Master Organization To
Halt Enemy Resistance.
'Mother', hey that's clever, huh?
My name's Jim Meadows.
'Mother' agent number thirty.
We're after an organization whose sole purpose
Is espionage and counter-espionage.
They will contact and sell to anyone.
I thought that you were contact agents.
We wouldn't know a contact agent if we saw one!
Tell me one thing.
How did you get here?
Well, it's a long story.
Yesterday, we were driving down the highway
On our way to Nashville.
Alright, let's begin.
What's your name?
- Boots Malone.
- Boots Malone.
Her name is Boots Malone.
Is that all the information you got from her?
- That's all we asked.
- I'll kill her.
Oh Max, shut up!
It's my opinion that
Boots Malone is a code name.
Quite possible.
- Boots. Boots.
- What could that mean?
I don't know. Ahhh, Malone!
- Ma-lone.
- Ma, ma, that's it!
Ma is a colloquialism for 'Mother'!
She's a 'Mother' agent, just as we thought!
Now, lone,
Lone, I, o, n, e.
Got it! L-1.
She is 'Mother' agent L-1!
What are you talking about?
My mother's in Las Vegas!
You leave the interrogation to us.
You go make contact with headquarters.
And, Max give them the formula.
We have been waiting.
We have the balance of the formula.
Dr. Himmel will read it to you.
C-three, H-five, radical, 0-number-three.
- Is that all?
- No. There's more.
It would be much simpler if you'd talk.
Talk! Talk about what?
Four, immedasoli-bi-tholomaine.
Beta-ameno-thexalaine.
Could you repeat that please?
We have ways of making people talk.
H-five-radical,
0-number-three.
- Four...
- Come on.
Immedasoli-bi-tholomaine.
Beta-amenothexalaine.
Heh, heh, he, huh-huh. We have waited so long for someone.
- Heh, heh, hee.
- Help me! Somebody!
I don't know any of this. Aaaaahh!
Aaaaahhhhh!
Aaaahhhh!
Aaaaahhhh!
Aaahhh!
Now, I think perhaps you had better answer a few questions!
- Alright!
- Did 'Mother' send you?
I told you, my mother's in Las Vegas!
This is the bedroom of the lady that lives here.
Nobody lives here! This place has been for sale for years!
Well, there is somebody living here.
Maybe it's a ghost.
I'll have to see that before I believe it.
That's where we saw that wierdwolf, over there.
- In that closet there.
- I want to take a look.
Here's your werewolf.
Come take a look.
Here he is!
Well, that's sure going to a lot of trouble just to scare a guy.
This whole house is rigged!
We've got to get out of here.
Let's go find that girl.
Put her in there.
That'll make her talk!
Oh! Oh! No! Oh! Ahgh!
Help! Help! Help!
Help!
Help!
Help! Help!
We may have some trouble relocating all this
Equipment on our new assignment.
Well, let's start dismantling it.
No, we'd better wait until we get a report from Dr. Fu.
We should have heard from him by now.
There's no need to be anxious.
It'll take some time to put the formula through.
There are some elaborate tests to be made.
And, there are two parts to the formula.
Could you determine what the ingredients were?
No. Of course, I didn't have time to examine, it carefully.
There's some strange and unusual components.
Maybe something entirely new in atomic research.
Hmmm, let's see.
No. There's nothing here I recognize.
Do you think that maybe we should split up?
Well, alright.
Why don't you take upstairs.
I'll take the outside.
- What about me?
- Why don't you go with him?
Oh by the way, what does she look like?
Blonde, blue eyes, very beautiful.
You have been tricked!
This formula is a fake!
You gave me the formula for
Nitroglycerin and an antihistamine!
- How can that be?
- Are you certain?
We are certain!
Our contact must have been a 'Mother' agent!
It is too dangerous to stay there.
Move quickly to your next assignment!
Well, what about the girl?
Poor Max! How you would love to dispose of the girl!
- The girl can identify us.
- We can leave her here.
No one will ever find her.
No one will even hear her!
Help! Help!
Our next assignment is in Allamagoridore.
Oh! I'm looking forward to that!
The dry climate will be wonderful for my sinuses!
- But, I'll miss this house.
- It has been fun, hasn't it?
Perhaps, we could create another haunted house.
No!
Could we try the ghost just once more?
- No!
- Oh! Just once more!
We'll find something else that will be just as fulfilling.
Max, go check the car.
Kreagar and Dr. Himmel will take care of the others upstairs.
Come, we'll take the passageway.
Now, wouldn't you say that was some trick?
Boy, I'd say that was some trick.
Boy, isn't it! You sure it's a trick?
Why sure it's a trick!
What else could it be?
- Well, it could be a ghost!
- Naw.
It sure does look real! Don't it?
Yeah. Go away!
You don't scare us!
Leave my house!
You are intruders!
Leave my house!
Leave my house!
Don't move!
- Now, they look real, enough.
- So do the guns!
After them!
Help! Let me out!
Help! Let me out!
- Are you alright?
- I think so.
Boy, am I glad to see a friendly face!
- Who are you?
- I'll explain later.
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.
That gorilla must be playing games again!
- We'll stop him.
- This time I'll kill him!
Give yourself up!
Give yourself up!
Leave my house! You are intruders in my house!
But, you're not one of ours!
A ghost! A ghost, a real one!
You fool! There are no ghosts!
- But, I saw him!
- Oh!
Get the gun, Woody!
Quit playin' around and get the gun!
Come on! Woody!
Come on! Woody!
Get over there! Face the wall! Both of you!
Yes Ma'am.
It's that nice, friendly, Chinese lady.
Not very friendly right now! Go on.
(ANATOLE GROWLS AND
SOUNDS OF SCUFFLE)
You! Augh! Augh!
Augh!
Oh, you know,
I really enjoyed that!
I didn't like him at all!
You have intruded.
You have taken my name and my house.
You have disturbed the dead!
Is that a promise? You will look me up in Nashville.
When I make a promise,
Especially to a beautiful girl like you,
- I don't break it.
- Thank you.
'Mother' is very grateful.
- Thank you. Glad we could help.
- You'll get a medal for this.
Glad to help. Just mail the medal to Nashville!
We're on our way.
We're on our way.
We're on our way to a swinging Jamboree.
Yeah! We're on our way.
We're on our way.
We're on our way to
Nashville, Tennessee.
Oueee. Oueee. Oueee.
We're livin' it up tonight!
Ladies and Gentlemen, we travel,
That is most of the entertainers in the Country Music field,
I'd say, better than a hundred thousand miles a year.
A lot of shows we work,
We're not lucky enough to have women on them.
Tonight, we're real fortunate.
Here's another beautiful blonde, dressed in a beautiful blue.
Marcella Wright!
Now we're strangers,
Completely strangers.
When we meet, you turn and look the other way.
How can we be strangers, completely strangers,
When we were so in love just yesterday.
On the night that we met,
It was true love at first sight.
You held me in your arms,
And your arms felt oh so right.
Our love seemed to blossom,
As the days grew windy, dear.
And, you went away and filled my heart with fear.
And now, we're strangers,
Completely strangers.
I just can't believe you'd take your love from me.
Now, we're strangers,
Completely strangers,
And, I'm alone with just a memory.
Now we're strangers,
Completely strangers.
When we meet, you turn and look the other way.
How can we be strangers,
Completely strangers,
When we were so in love just yesterday.
When we were so in love just yesterday.
Ladies and Gentlemen, one of my favorite singers,
One of my favorite people,
Mr. Merle Haggard! Merle
This old smoke-filled bar is something I'm not used to.
But, I gave up my home to keep you satisfied.
I just called to let you know where I'll be living.
It's not much, but, I feel welcome here inside.
I've got swinging doors,
And a juke box, and a barstool.
My new home has a flashing neon sign.
Stop by and see me anytime you want to.
'Cause I'm always here at home 'till closing time.
I've got everything I need,
To drive me crazy.
I've got everything it takes to lose my mind.
And in here, the atmosphere's just right for heartaches.
Thanks to you I'm always here 'till closing time.
Now I've got swinging doors,
A jukebox, and a barstool.
My new home has a flashing neon sign.
Stop by and see me anytime you want to.
'Cause I'm always here at home 'till closing time.
I'm always here at home 'till closing time.
Thank you, very much.
Now, I'd like to introduce somebody to ya,
That I've known for a few years. As a matter of fact,
We worked together when she was about eleven years old,
Out in California.
She was real cute then, now, she's even more beautiful.
Let's make her welcome,
Miss Molly Bee.
Heartbreak U.S.A.
The harbor's empty.
My love has gone.
With aching heart I face
The cold and lonely dawn.
Until the trade winds
Bring him home to stay,
I'll live in heartbreak U.S.A.
Don't let those geisha girls
Get your heart in a whirl.
And, if you meet some sweet frauline,
Remember, you're mine.
Don't forget your sweetheart
While you're away.
Back home in heartbreak U.S.A.
U.S.A.
Sometimes I'm lonely,
And time stands still.
And, I wonder if you feel,
The way I always will.
So darling write me,
Letters every day.
In care of, heartbreak U.S.A.
Don't forget your sweetheart
While you're away,
Back home in heartbreak U.S.A.
In heartbreak U.S.A.
Back stage while ago,
Cricket Stone and myself were talkin' about
Singers and all that, and we tried our best
To get this next fellow to sing a song.
We finally talked him into it.
Make him welcome, the good Jeepers!
And they got into the wrong house again last night.
I bought myself a house a few months back.
And, it's a darlin' little house, that's a fact.
How-some-ever, there's a certain seven others there that's exact.
And, would you believe, I got in the wrong one again, last night!
My neighbor's got a dog about two feet high.
Cutest little dog, wouldn't hurt a fly.
One day, I stumbled in their house by mistake,
This mornin' about five.
And, that cute little, stupid dog nearly ate me alive!
I came in last night, and felt like I had two heads.
And, I was sneakin' in the house,
When this sweet voice yelled out and said,
Oooh Bill darlin',
Put out the kitty cat, and come to bed.
And I said, Oooh, surprise, my name's Fred.
I went to the next house, and knocked on the bell.
And, this guy about eleven feet tall answered the door and said,
What the... And, I said, well
I was just sorta in the area,
And I thought maybe you'd like to chit-chat for a spell.
But, he threw me out the back door, and called me some names.
So I went to sleep in the next house,
And I saw it looked about the same.
I woke up this morning with my arms around a great dane.
Some silly kid lookin' in the door, yellin' Gravy Train.
And, I got into to the wrong house again, last night.
Sure am glad I'm me!
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Here's somebody that needs no introduction,
But, I'm going to introduce her anyhow.
My part time lover,
Boots Malone!
- Kill them baby.
- Thank you.
Well now, on Monday
I'm your darlin',
On Tuesday I'm your baby,
But on Wednesday you don't get around to me.
I don't want a part time lover.
Can't take a part time lover.
Won't have a part time lover, no siree!
I need your huggin',
I need your kissin'.
It's your huggin' and your kissin' I've been missin'.
Now, if I'm not your one and only,
I'd rather go on feelin' lonely,
'Till the day the right one comes my way.
I must refuse a part time lover.
Can't use a part time lover.
Got to have a full time lover every day.
- I need your huggin'.
- Need your huggin'.
- I need your kissin'.
- Need your kissin'.
It's your huggin' and your kissin' I've been missin'.
Now, if I'm not your one and only,
I'd rather go on feelin' lonely,
'Till the day the right comes my way.
I must refuse a part time lover.
Can't use a part time lover.
Got to have a full time lover
- everyday.
- Everyday.
Got to have a full time lover
- everyday.
- Everyday.
Got to have a full time lover
Everyday!
Well, huh, huh,
Fellows, are you ready to cross one of these bridges with me?
Okay Red, take it off.
That's the one bridge
I have never crossed.
Everyone I ever loved, I always lost.
For a true love, I'd gladly pay the cost.
But, that's the one bridge I have never crossed.
All my life I have traveled over the country.
I've even flown and sailed across the sea.
Name a famous bridge, I'll bet you that I've crossed it.
And, all the women that I've loved have all crossed me.
That's the one bridge
I have never crossed.
Everyone I ever loved I always lost.
For a true love, I'd gladly pay the cost.
But, that's the one bridge
I have never crossed.
I've made a lot of money in my lifetime.
I've got a million friends, and I know some enemies.
But, nobody knows how bad I need affection.
And, how I long to find a love that won't cross me.
That's the one bridge
I have never crossed.
Everyone I ever loved, I always lost.
For a true love, I'd gladly pay the cost.
But, that's the one bridge I have never crossed.
That's the one bridge
I have never crossed.
Everyone I ever loved, I always lost.
For a true love, I'd gladly pay the cost.
But, that's the one bridge I have never crossed.
Yes, that's the one bridge I have never crossed.
Everyone I ever loved,
I always lost.
For a true love, I'd gladly pay the cost.
But, that's the one bridge I have never crossed.
That's the one bridge
I have never crossed.
It's Jamboree time in
Nashville, Tennessee.

Here we go.
We're supposed to dust those potatoes, not peel them.
Would you like them mashed?
You did want to miss that barn.
What barn?
What's with the razor-sharp turns?
There's no silver cup at the end of this run.
Trying to save a little gas.
Nice scenery around here.
If you've seen one potato, you've seen them all.
I just spotted a couple of sweet potatoes.
You're a little confused.
Those down there are russets.
Whatever they are, I'll take a bushel.
Chicks. I thought so.
How about the one in the red dress?
Her ankles are a little thick... but she's more your type.
I don't care if you wreck your half of the plane... but mine I want to keep. Pull her up.
You just don't know a sweet potato when you see one.
No, but I know a telephone pole when I see one. Pull her up.
So long, girls.
- All finished up?
- Yep. That's it for this year.
Charlie, give us a hand taking off this duster, will you?
Let's go get the loot.
My offer still holds good if you boys ever want a steady job.
Thanks. We kind of like working for ourselves.
You got families up in Sherrington?
That I've got to observe,
Mike with a family.
No, sir. It's just home base.
- See you next season.
- By then, we'll have our own airline.
Maybe five or six pilots working for us, right?
- Thank you, Mr. Farr.
- Bye. Good luck, boys.
Before we take off, you want to go into town and have a beer?
- Good. I'll meet you back here in an hour.
- Aren't you coming?
I'd like to, but I can't.
I better take care of the money.
That's okay. I'll take care of the money.
You better let me hang on to it.
'Cause at my Aunt Clara's house
I'd just be worrying myself half to death.
- You going to see Aunt Clara again?
- Just to say good-bye.
- Poor old gal.
- Still sick?
Terrible.
If it wasn't so contagious,
I'd ask you to come over.
You don't have a sick Aunt Clara any more than you had a sick Uncle George.
All right. But you shouldn't be responsible for my half of the money.
I won't.
It's not fair to you.
You said it.
Don't tell me. It's going right in the kitty.
Right. A little matter of unpaid bills back in Sherrington. Remember?
Look. I'll settle for $50.
Danny, you've got that gambling gleam in your eye.
- Where's it gonna be? Charlie's Garage?
And after you promised to give up gambling.
It's not really gambling.
It's an investment in our future.
- I'm doing it for you.
- You're doing it for kicks.
You spend your dough on dolls and duds.
- What's that, penance?
- At least I've still got the duds.
About the dolls, that's different.
I know, you're making a scalp collection.
- Five measly dollars.
- Okay. Five measly dollars.
But the rest goes in the vault.
You know something, Mike? You're right.
Even if I come begging to you on my hands and knees...
- don't give me that key.
- You can count on it, buddy.
- I'll take a walk around town.
- Happy hunting.
I better hurry before the season closes.
Don't wait for me.
I gotta stow this gear away.
- All right.
- See you.
Now, let's see.
"Ann, Betty, Claudette...
"Dorothy.
"3820 Maple Street."
Please, Mike,
I better go make us some iced tea.
Calm down, honey.
You're like a fluttering bird.
Wouldn't you like a glass of iced tea?
Sure, but later, Shirley.
I'm Dorothy.
To me you'll always be Shirley, the Greek goddess of beauty.
I thought that was Aphrodite.
Could be.
I really ought to go and see about that iced tea.
Honey, you're going to have a seizure carrying on like this.
I am?
Sure, racing that sweet little motor of yours on a warm day, that's bad.
I really better go and fix that iced tea.
Dorothy.
- Mom. Dad.
- Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
- Johnson.
- Well?
You're home early.
- I'd say we got home just in time.
- I hope.
We were going to have iced tea.
Care to join us?
Get me my gun, Emma.
If you don't like iced tea, I could get beer.
- I said to get my gun.
- Henry, please.
- Dad, you can't, we were just...
- I'll get it myself.
He has a terrible temper when he has his gun.
You'd better go, young man.
If you think so. That's a coward's way out.
Good-bye, Mom, Shirley.
I'm Dorothy.
- Where'd he go?
- Henry, you mustn't go out there.
- Let go of me. He's getting away.
- You can't shoot him.
What do you mean l...
- I'll see your $10 and raise you $10.
- $20 and $10 better.
I'll call.
Three gentlemen.
Sorry, pal. All blue.
Up, chum. We're pulling out.
- What's the matter?
- I'll tell you later. Let's move.
One second, flyboy.
- Your friend has to settle up first.
- What do you mean, settle up?
I was light in a couple of pots.
Yeah, just a little.
Said you'd make good with these IOU's.
It's that darn lowball.
I couldn't get any cards.
You sharks let a guy with only $5 on him... get into you for $700?
$5? He dropped $400 in cash before he went on the tab.
You blew our pay.
"Mike, don't give me the key even if I come crawling."
You're tensing up.
- Come on. Quit stalling.
- You must be kidding. We're busted.
- You ain't been busted yet.
- You fellows got enough.
Get them.
Danny. Come on, boy. Get up.
Danny. It's me.
Let's get out of here. Come on.
- Hurry up, will you?
- Yeah, I'm hurrying.
- Home again.
- And broke again.
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, Sheriff Garland.
What tears you away from pinochle?
Couple of desperadoes headed this way?
Nope. Just a couple of deadbeats.
Sure hope you find them.
I just did.
Anyone we know?
Had a little phone call from Clarie about you boys.
In these parts, when a man loses at poker, he's expected to pay up.
- I mean to. I will.
- You will not. They took you.
There's a difference between losing and getting swindled.
Maybe.
What about those other debts you have here in Sherrington?
They add up to almost $1,200.
- We'll pay them off.
We start a seeding job tomorrow for a lumber company.
You'll have a rough time up there, dropping seeds without an airplane.
- Translation?
- I'm attaching your plane.
- Come on, Sheriff.
- Without Bessie, we're dead.
You're dead. Hand over the keys.
Taking our plane won't get them their money.
Hold it, fellows.
Pardon me, Sheriff.
Now just what do you think you're doing?
I'm giving you my IOU.
I'm giving you just two weeks before she goes up for auction.
If you don't give me the money by then, it's going, going, gone.
Keys.
It's a little too late for that, buddy.
Come on, Mike. Let's get cleaned up.
Guess what, Danny?
- He just cleaned us up.
- Yeah.
There's so many things you could have been.
A drunk, an arsonist, but no.
I'm teamed up with the last of the red-hot losers.
Wrong.
If you averaged out my bets for the last 10 years, I'm ahead.
Then where's the money?
I've had expenses.
Besides, I'm trying to get us a stake... so we can expand, be executives.
Start our own airline.
Knock it off. We've been chasing that rainbow for three years.
How do you like those creeps?
You'd think we were a couple of hobos.
Instead of two airline executives.
I'm tired of you digging in with those spurs all the time.
If you can go places faster on your own, far be it for me...
I don't want to be a rock on anybody's neck.
Want to break up the partnership?
- I'm not saying I want to.
- You're the guy who brought it up.
Come on. What is all this?
We're supposed to be buddies.
You don't want to bust up?
I don't see much point in it.
Things can't get any worse.
Don't underestimate yourself, buddy.
There you go again needling.
You're always needling.
- Told you our luck would change.
- Where you headed?
- Up north.
- Isn't that a gas?
North, just like us.
Do you gentlemen have a match?
Something's happened to our lighter.
- Sure.
- Allow me.
By all means.
It's only gold plate, honey, but it is all yours.
Thank you.
- Our luck's changed?
- Maybe we just lost the touch.
And your gold-plated lighter.
Danny, come on.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.
- Where are you going?
- Seattle.
Seattle. Fantastic.
That's just where we're headed.
- Great, huh?
- What's so great?
Uncle Walter's taking me to see a world's fair.
- Good for you, honey.
- The World's Fair. We're saved.
Come on, Mike.
Can I ride in the back with Mr. Mike?
Let's go.
Right down.
All right. Up.
There. Be careful.
All set, Mr. Ling.
Danny, what's so big with you and the World's Fair?
Don't you get it?
The World's Fair, Seattle. Vince Bradley.
Let's don't get hung up on that guy again.
He's always good for a touch.
Forget it.
He's probably serving time, anyway.
No, when they closed his gambling ship, they only ran him out of town.
If I know Vince, he's back by now.
What we want to do is earn some money, not get involved...
Okay. Maybe he can put us on to something.
Yeah, the first train to the big house.
- It won't hurt to call him up and say hello.
- You call him up and say hello.
This highway hiking's a bad scene.
I'm going to cork off for a while.
Pardon me, Mr. Mike, do you know how to fix a ukulele?
I'll give it a try.
- What's your name?
- Sue-Lin.
Do you play this thing, Sue-Lin?
I'm just learning. I got it for my birthday.
That's nice. How old are you?
A girl isn't supposed to tell her age.
Not if she doesn't want to.
But I'll tell you. I'm really seven... except when I go on a bus.
Then I'm only five.
That'll be our secret.
- Now try it.
- I might break it again.
I think I used too much thumb.
Could be.
I have a real secret.
Promise you won't laugh?
Cross my heart.
- I don't know something.
- You don't?
No. And I'm ashamed to tell Uncle Walter.
What is the World's Fair?
Let's see.
First of all, it's a collection of exhibits.
What are exhibits?
They're sort of things you put on exhibition.
What are exhibition?
I don't seem to be explaining it very well, do I?
Not so far.
I'll tell you what.
Maybe this will give you an idea of what it will be like.
I think.
Just like you said. Too much thumb.
That, Mr. Mike, what's that?
It's called a monorail, honey.
Sorry, gentlemen. This end of the line.
- Thanks for the ride, Mr. Ling.
- Thank you, Mr. Ling.
Here we go, honey.
Are we going to ride on the monorail?
Soon as I make a phone call to see if I have any messages.
Good-bye, Mr. Mike, Mr. Danny.
- So long, kid.
- Have fun, honey.
Let's put this stuff away.
- I'll take care of the guitar.
- Just don't hock it.
I won't.
All right.
- Let's get to the airport.
- I'll take that, sonny.
- Start looking for a job.
- What's the stress?
If we don't start working, we'll stop eating. That's the stress.
I hate to see you panic like this.
Vince will put us up for a couple of days.
We don't even know if Vince Bradley's in town, much less where.
- So we ask around.
- Lf we spend a day looking for the guy... and come up empty, we'll sleep in the park.
And besides, if we find him...
- Mr. Mike.
- Yes.
- What's the matter, honey?
- Big disappointment.
Have to do special job right away for important customer.
- Cannot take niece to the fair.
- That's too bad.
Don't cry, honey. It will be all right.
Atta girl.
- Why don't you take her?
- Brilliant.
- Would you, Mr. Mike?
- I'd like to, but you see, we have to...
- Please.
- It'll be good for you.
You've been tensing up lately.
Danny, you keep forgetting, we got no folding stuff.
- We're broke. We're strapped.
- Only temporarily.
What's the matter? Your feet hurt?
- Where'd you get...
- Calm down. $10 for you. $10 for me.
I've been keeping it for an emergency.
Now can you take me, Mr. Mike?
I have $4 saved from my allowance.
We'll go Dutch treat.
Look at the kid.
Mr. Ling, you don't mind if he takes her to the fair, do you?
I guess it's okay.
As long as you get her back by 8:00.
I'll meet you here myself. 8:00 sharp.
- Big deal.
- Will you, Mr. Mike?
Go ahead.
As I was saying, we better get started if we're going to see everything.
- So long, gentlemen.
- Have a nice time.
- See you, Mr. Ling.
- Bye, Mr. Danny.
I wish we had a seat that faced the front.
I can see fine from here.
Excuse me, miss.
Would you like to have my seat?
- No, thank you. I'd rather stand.
- Good.
There's the Ferris wheel.
Look at it go around.
Amazing.
Golly, I don't know where to begin.
Take your choice.
You haven't seen anything yet.
- We got a lot of looking to do.
- I'm hungry.
- We got a lot of eating to do. Come on.
- Good.
The more dimes I have on the table... the more chance we have of getting a winner.
Play for a dime.
You toss them in, you win, you pick it out... any prize you see, any prize you like.
Let's get a big-prize winner.
Who will be the next prize winner?
And the little lady wins a big doggie.
And we have another winner.
They got another winner.
All right. You win, smarty.
- Want me to carry it for you?
- No. I love it.
It's bigger than you are, you know.
That's a dream car.
I'd love to get that for Uncle Walter.
- What, to deliver apples in?
- That's silly.
You're silly.
Seven-course Chinese dinner, 99 cents.
Come on, Mr. Mike.
- I'll have...
- One egg roll, please.
Here you are.
- Something for you, sir?
- No, thank you.
- Something for you.
- Thank you.
Come on.
Oh, no.
What's the matter?
Don't you like popcorn?
- Here you are, Sue-Lin.
- Thank you.
I don't feel good, Mr. Mike.
I wonder why.
Easy, honey, easy. We'll fix you up.
Good heavens. What's the matter?
- I got stomach ache.
- She went overboard on the groceries.
I'm afraid it's my fault.
That's generally the case.
Are you all right?
Sure. My stomach went through three years in the Army.
- Is that dog yours or the child's?
- I'm just holding it for her, ma'am.
Come along, dear.
This shouldn't take too long.
I've never seen a little girl eat so much stuff in my life.
Wonder where she puts it all.
No wonder she's sick.
I shouldn't let her eat all that junk.
Hot dogs, Cracker Jacks.
"Is that dog yours?"
What a stupid question.
I hope Sue-Lin's all right.
I shouldn't let her eat all that junk anyway.
Popcorn, Cracker Jacks, and strawberry waffles.
Pardon me. Are you next?
No. I was just waiting.
Come to think of it, yes.
What's seems to be the trouble?
It's my eye, ma'am.
- Did you get something in it?
- Yeah. I must have.
- Which eye?
- It's hard to tell. It changes.
You see, one minute there's something in this eye... and the next minute there's something in this eye.
It goes back and forth.
If you look a little closer, maybe you can see what I'm talking about.
This way, please.
Would you like to bring your doggie with you?
I think he'll be all right here.
- Don't run off, Tiger.
- I beg your pardon.
I was just talking to the dog.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
- What's your name?
- Miss Warren.
Do I have to call you Miss Warren?
No. If you prefer, you may call me Nurse Warren.
Thanks.
- You see anything?
- Nothing.
Excuse me. I'm getting dizzy.
There is nothing in either eye.
Maybe it's right in the middle just passing onto my nose.
Going from one eye to the other.
I'm afraid that would be medically impossible.
You can't tell. Science is making new discoveries every day.
Yes, and it's too bad they haven't come up with a wolf repellent.
Okay. I rushed it.
My name is Mike Edwards.
I'd like to start over again.
The only thing that I want you to start, Mr. Edwards... is out!
I know I have a tendency to press, but it's a personality flaw.
Basically, I'm not a bad guy.
Do you want me to call a guard?
- I like it better with just the two of us.
- Mr. Mike.
- Hi. How do you feel?
- All better.
- Good.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- The lady had me drink something bubbly.
- And now my stomach ache's all gone.
- Good.
Were you sick, too?
No. I just caught something in my eye.
I'm afraid it will be there for a long time.
- Good-bye, Mr. Edwards.
- Good-bye, Miss Warren.
- Mr. Edwards.
- Yes?
- You forgot your doggie.
- That's my doggie.
I'm glad you told her.
Come on. We still got lots to see.
- Popcorn, Mr. Mike?
- Are you sure?
Two popcorns.
Mr. Danny.
- Hi, buddy.
- She's sleeping.
I get her right to bed.
Thanks so much, Mr. Edwards.
Not at all, Mr. Ling. In fact, I enjoyed it.
I wish good luck. Hope you both find jobs.
Thank you.
Tell Sue-Lin when she wakes up
I said good-bye.
- Will tell.
- You do that.
- I have big news, colleague.
- Find us a job?
A job? Don't be so crude.
This is good news.
We'll have to line up something.
Now, patience, patience.
Our relief ship is in.
All we have to do is climb up the gangway.
That's nice.
What's with you, punctured ear drums?
I'm delivering a big message.
Okay, so you found Vince Bradley.
Mike, level off. Is something wrong?
No. As a matter of fact I feel kind of good.
In a lousy sort of way.
Come on, what happened?
- You'll probably laugh yourself to death.
- Come on.
I ran into this girl today.
Flash! He ran into a girl, today!
Yeah, I know.
But this girl is...
I must be flipping my lid.
She's not even my type.
You mean like aloof?
Worse. Chilly. Ice-cold.
They all have to be room-temperature, right?
Come on, I've got something
I want to show you.
- Regardez.
- Who does it belong to?
- You'll have to see him to believe him.
- Someone you used to know?
Guy named Barney Thatcher.
Met him this afternoon.
What's so special with Mr. Thatcher?
He happens to be absolutely, far and away... the worst gin-rummy player in the world.
Hop in.
Come on.
Are you nuts or something?
- We'll get thrown...
- Here we have the living room.
Follow me, please. Dining room... kitchen, bedroom, and down the corner, shall we say the family room.
- Charming, but whose is it?
- It's ours for the next two weeks.
- Pretty posh?
- Details.
I cannot tell a lie.
I did with my little pasteboards.
Gin. Three blitzes and a double in spades!
Get out the cards, Danny boy. I'm ready.
I'll clobber you tonight.
Easy there, buckaroo.
Barney, this is Mike Edwards.
Barney Thatcher, our host.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi. Play gin?
Not me.
So shuffle the cards.
We haven't parked the car or brought our bags in yet.
I'll park the car.
I'll bring in the bags. You shuffle.
I'll do that.
Danny, you weren't born. You were dealt.
Where'd you dig him up?
At a bridge club
Vince Bradley used to hang around.
Bridge club?
That's what the guard at the door called it.
Excuse me. I'll take it.
Come on, Danny. Deal.
My lucky chair.
What about your wife?
Don't worry about her.
She fell asleep in front of the TV. Deal.
Barney!
Those commercials always wake her up.
Come on. Deal a fast one.
Coming, precious!
You miserable...
Sounds like she keeps him on a pretty tight leash.
He doesn't even get an allowance.
All I could win was rent and use of the station wagon.
You're forgiven.
But we'll have to get a move on to get a job tomorrow.
In 12 days, Bessie goes on the block.
Don't worry. We'll raise the dough.
She's the kind who might go for the sympathy bit.
Who?
The nurse I met at the fairgrounds today.
Florence Nightingale, servant of humanity, and all that jazz.
The rabbit hunter rides again.
Some doll gives him the brush, and right away it's a challenge.
I'll tell her she's keeping me up at nights, ruining my health, breaking my heart.
She'll probably hand you a pill.
You'd be surprised, Danny.
Some women love to think they can destroy you.
And do.
Quiet! You'll wake Thelma.
It's just unbelievable.
Yeah. I can't figure it.
Not one lousy job opening.
Every cloudhopper in the country must be here for the fair.
I still say Vince Bradley's our best bet.
Why don't you knock it off?
You're sounding like a broken record.
- Vince Bradley, Vince Bradley...
- He never listens to me.
You never listen to me.
I wonder why.
Kid, how would you like to kick me in the shin?
How would I like to kick you in the shin?
- Mister, are you drunk?
- No kidding. I'll tell you what.
Kick me in the shin real hard,
I'll give you a quarter.
Go ahead, play it.
That's a good one, boy.
Adults, they're all nuts.
Nurse, I had an accident.
You again?
I think I broke my leg.
Only a broken leg?
You can do better than that.
How about malaria or hydrophobia?
This is on the level. I'm hurt really.
Miss Warren, why aren't you taking care of this man?
Because I don't believe he's injured.
You have to take my word for it,
I am injured.
- Let me have a look at it.
- I'd appreciate it, ma'am. Here it is.
Easy, ma'am, easy.
Why, it's a definite skin abrasion, and it's swelling.
- I'm terribly sorry. I thought...
- That's all right, honey, Miss Warren.
If you give me something for the pain...
- it'll be all right.
- Of course.
- Let's take this gentleman inside.
- Yes, ma'am.
Forgive Miss Warren.
Lately her mind seems to be in outer space.
Yes, ma'am.
Sit over there, please.
Miss Warren, would you take my coat off, please?
Miss Warren, would you help me on the table, please?
Thank you.
How did this happen?
I tripped on something.
Broken pavement, I think.
- Broken pavement? In the fairgrounds?
- Yes.
Do you remember the exact location?
I sort of blacked out.
It'll probably come back to me when I talk to my lawyer.
- Your lawyer?
- Yeah, he's a wonderful guy.
If you give him a call,
I'm sure he'll be glad to come over.
I don't think you need to bring your lawyer into this.
I don't want to cause trouble, but I think he'll want a statement.
Besides, I don't have any other way of getting home.
I'm sure we can do something about that.
Miss Warren, you're just going off duty, aren't you?
- Yes, but...
- I don't want to impose.
If you just phone my lawyer, it'll be all right.
It's no imposition at all.
Miss Warren will be delighted to see you safely home.
- Won't you, dear?
- Delighted.
There we are.
By tomorrow, you'll be as good as new.
Whatever you say and my lawyer thinks.
- Here's your coat, Mr. Edwards.
- Thank you.
I'll go and change...
- and meet you in the waiting room.
- That's mighty nice.
Will you just walk up and down on that, please?
I'm sure that by tomorrow it will be perfectly all right.
I hope so.
Get in.
Nice of you to take this trouble.
No trouble at all.
It's the least I can do for the good of the fair.
If you've got a date tonight,
I hope he'll forgive the delay.
If I did, he would. But I don't.
- No steady?
- I beg your pardon?
No one particular guy you go out with all the time?
I hardly see how that concerns you.
If I'm gonna go around breaking my legs on your account...
- I should at least know where I stand.
- On my account?
Sure. The way I've been feeling since we met... it's just been blind luck that I haven't been run over by a bus.
No other girl has ever affected me that way.
You mean as a rule, you just treat them as sisters.
I wouldn't go that far... but up until now when I was alone up in the blue with Bessie...
I didn't feel the need for anybody else.
- Bessie?
- She's my airplane.
You're a flyer.
Yeah. 9,000 hours in the air,
8,000 with a plane.
- Air Force?
- No.
Airline pilot?
No. You could call me one of the last pioneers.
Just going where the wind blows.
Flying wherever I'm needed.
You're looking for work.
We're coming up to the gate.
I'll put you in a cab there.
Stop the cart. It's happening again.
- What's the matter?
- Everything's going black. I feel pale.
Try to calm down. Get a hold of yourself.
Maybe I should've eaten something yesterday.
Yesterday?
When was the last time you did eat?
It's been days. I need nourishment.
Please try to control yourself.
There's a restaurant up at the top of the Space Needle.
- There is?
- We'll go get you something.
Okay, you're the doctor.
- What?
- Nurse.
Just give me these and lean on me.
It's okay.
- Hi, Erna.
- Hi, Diane. Any news?
- Not yet.
- I've got my fingers crossed for you.
- Thank you.
- See you later.
What was that about, Diane?
I've applied for a job in the government's space medicine program.
That's great.
It must give a girl a wonderful feeling... to know she can do something useful.
Mr. Edwards, it just may...
My foot.
Hold it, folks. Back of the line.
But his foot is giving him a lot of pain.
- You can go the short way.
- Thank you.
Going up.
Sorry. You'll have to wait for the next one.
- Coffee later?
- That will be fine.
- Coffee later, please.
- Thank you.
Isn't Mount Rainier beautiful?
Breathtaking.
Can I help it if I'm not so large for mountains?
See, there I go, pressing again.
- That's one thing I have to watch.
- Do that, Mr. Edwards.
Mike. I'll try, but it's not so easy with a girl like you.
What kind of a girl am I?
For one thing, you've got ideals.
You look to the future... like going into the space program.
Have you seen any of the exhibits here... like the Spacearium or the Space Administration display?
Yeah. Fantastic.
They certainly changed my outlook.
All of a sudden, stomach aches and twisted ankles and broken legs... just stopped seeming so important.
I guess you can have a tendency to overrate them.
- Present leg excepted.
- Thank you.
Tell me some more about the space program.
- All right. Are you really a pilot?
- Sure.
The program has a lot of jobs a pilot can qualify for.
I might just look into that.
There might come a time when we'll remember this... as the day I started out with a broken leg... and thanks to you ended up strapped in a nose cone.
If this were anyone else but me,
I'd say the altitude was to blame.
- For what?
- The way I feel.
You're not blacking out again?
No. I never felt better in my life.
I could have sworn we were alone.
Let's go.
- Let me help you.
- I'll be all right.
As your nurse, I insist.
Don't walk so fast.
Is it getting worse?
A little. This stampede isn't helping either.
You'd better get off your feet.
Come on. I'll take you home.
Thank you.
- By the way, do you live far from here?
- No.
I'm way out at the other end of town.
- Maybe if I could rest at your place...
- Of course.
- I feel terrible about not believing you.
- Forget it.
Hi, mister.
Hi, kid. See you around.
Come on. Let's go, honey. It's getting late.
Would you like me to kick you in the shin again?
Why don't you get lost, little boy.
What an imagination he's got.
Come on. I could use another quarter.
Here's a half a dollar. Now disappear.
Little boy, did this man really give you a quarter to kick him?
Yes. He's some kind of nut.
Be careful, lady.
So long.
You miserable...
Diane, believe me, the kid's an absolute stranger.
And you're an absolute liar.
"I'm falling in love tonight."
But I am. I mean, I was. I did.
As far as I'm concerned, you can go jump off the Space Needle!
Diane, wait a minute.
Let me explain, will you?
Diane, wait a minute.
Mr. Mike, I'm so glad I found you.
- I've been looking for you for hours.
- Just a second, honey.
Mr. Mike, please, my Uncle Walter has disappeared.
Good.
What am I going to do? He's gone.
What? Who's gone?
My Uncle Walter.
He went out with his truck this morning... to pick up a load for our trip home and he never came back for me.
Take it easy, honey.
What time was he supposed to come back?
9:00 this morning.
I waited at the rooming house until almost 3:00 in the afternoon... but he didn't call or anything... so I came out here to look for you.
- You're the only friend I have in Seattle.
- Don't cry.
Blow.
Again.
That's my girl.
You stop crying and don't worry about a thing.
- I'll help you find Uncle Walter.
- Thank you.
Come on. The dice gets cold.
That's all right. Not out. Still alive.
- Get the door, will you?
- Thelma.
Quick. Get in here. Hurry up.
You want Thelma to kill me?
- What you got there?
- Twins.
Excuse me.
- Wait a minute.
- What are you doing?
Hold it down, will you?
Let the 10 ride.
Seven or 11 does it.
Come on, fellows, what do you say?
Seven or 11.
- Snake eyes. You lose.
- That's wonderful.
There you go.
What are Danny and those men doing out there?
They're having a business conference.
What kind of business?
Boxcars, you lose.
They're railroad men.
You'd better get undressed and put your pajamas on.
You'll have to turn around.
I'll do better than that.
I'll leave the room, okay?
Thank you.
Come on. It's an easy point.
Eight.
All right, fellows.
- The game is over.
- What are you talking about?
Hold it, fellows. I'll handle it.
- What do you mean, the game's over?
- That's it. It's over.
I get it, it's on account of the kid.
- What's with her?
- Her uncle disappeared.
- She's going to stay here all night.
- But why here?
Because she doesn't have any other place to stay.
What if her uncle comes back looking for her?
I left word she'd be here.
I'm sorry, fellows.
You're gonna have to go.
Let's go to my trailer.
It's my wife's bowling night.
Stick around. We can be quiet.
We're just betting paper money.
Hurry up, Danny, before the dice cool off.
Nice going. Now I lose the house's cut.
The house's cut?
You won't be happy until we're both in front of a judge.
At least I am trying to scratch up a buck, not run a nursery.
Come on, Danny.
You'd better get back to your crap game.
And God bless Uncle Walter and God bless Mr. Mike.
Time for you to go to bed, little lady.
- Good night, Mr. Mike.
- Good night, Sue-Lin.
I'll turn your bed down.
You just go right to sleep and don't worry about a thing... because tomorrow you'll be back with Uncle Walter.
- All right?
- I can't help worrying a little.
- What if I can't go to sleep?
- Just close your eyes.
Both of them.
- Hello.
- Hello, Diane. It's Mike Edwards.
Still no U-N-C-L-E?
No. We haven't found him yet.
You look beat.
Go in and have a glass of milk.
- Okay. Do you want one?
- Maybe later. You go ahead.
- You try the cops?
- Yep. They don't have a thing.
Why don't you get ahold of her folks?
Uncle Walter is the whole family.
That's rough, old buddy... but we've done all we can.
This is a job for, like, a social worker.
No dice.
They'd put her in some detention home.
Why don't you soften up?
She's a helpless little girl.
I liked it better when you stuck to helpless big girls.
After all, we didn't come to Seattle to baby-sit.
It won't be for long.
Long enough for you to strike out with that nurse.
I've already struck out.
Last night she hung up on me.
Besides, Sue-Lin comes first.
Look, chum. Get back on the ground.
This is no place for a kid...
- and you know it.
- It'll have to do, buddy.
Gin time, Danny boy.
Thelma's gone to the dressmaker.
I'm free for a mad half-hour.
- What'll it be? Your place or mine?
- It'll have to be yours.
It seems the pied piper here is entertaining.
Mike!
- What's the matter, honey?
- I feel kind of sick and dizzy.
You're burning up.
How long have you been like this?
It started all of a sudden, but I'll be okay.
You will not be okay. I'll call a doctor.
No, Mike. Please.
- But, honey, you have a temperature.
- I'm afraid of doctors.
They're men.
- Don't be silly. I'll be right back.
- I won't mind a lady doctor or a nurse.
I know. Why don't you call that nice Miss Warren at the fair?
- No.
- I bet she could make me feel better.
- Lf I thought it would...
- Please, won't you call her?
Almost 6:00. Okay. I'll give it a try.
You just lie still. I'll be right back.
- Hello.
- Hello. Miss Warren?
- Speaking.
- Diane, this is Mike Edwards.
Please don't hang up. This is important.
I'm sure it is.
I suppose you're soliciting funds for a broken-leg telethon.
No. Now listen.
You remember Sue-Lin, the girl
I brought in the dispensary the other day?
She's staying with me and she's sick, and she's asking for you.
What did you do, kick her in the leg?
This is on the level.
She's got some kind of fever.
It was her idea to call you.
I'm sorry, Mr. Edwards, but I just don't believe you.
Mike, can I speak to her?
No. What are you doing out here?
Go back inside.
Please. Maybe she'll believe me.
- Hello.
- I doubt it, but you can try.
Just a second, please.
Hello, Miss Warren.
Sue-Lin?
It's really me, and I did ask Mike to call you.
My head's all hot.
Would you come and fix me?
I can't right now.
Please.
We're at the Century 21 Estates on Lakeview Road.
Would you, Miss Warren?
All right, Sue-Lin.
Just cover up and keep warm.
I'll get there just as soon as I can.
Thank you, Miss Warren. Good-bye.
Goody. She's coming.
- Say, are you starting to feel better?
- No.
Don't misunderstand me.
I wish you a speedy recovery... but not before she gets here.
Would you come in?
Where's Sue-Lin?
She's right back there in bed.
She'd better be.
Come with me, please.
Sue-Lin?
- Hello, Miss Warren.
- Why, what happened to you, little lady?
Have you been eating some more of those Belgian waffles?
No. I just don't feel so fine.
We'll fix you up.
Let's take a look at your throat first.
Say "ah."
There's no inflammation.
I'd better take your temperature.
You want to check her leg for footprints?
My leg doesn't hurt.
Mr. Edwards was merely being funny, dear.
Excuse me. Did you say merely or nearly?
I don't suppose you'd have time to fix a cold compress.
I might be able to squeeze it in.
My throat's dry.
Could I have a glass of water, please?
Yes, you may.
But you keep that right there, okay.
- The water's in the kitchen.
- All right.
- Excuse me. You want this very cold?
- Very cold.
It's cold, all right.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
You do have a temperature, 101.
I thought it would be higher than that.
Sue-Lin, how do you happen to be staying here?
I came to Seattle with my Uncle Walter, but he got lost.
So Mike said I could live here until we found him.
- Are you and Mike old friends?
- No.
I just met him two days ago.
He's the nicest man I've ever known.
I must say he's full of surprises.
What's the verdict?
She does have a little temperature, but I don't think it's serious.
Here, honey. You take these.
There. That's a girl.
That's it.
Now I want you to get some sleep.
- All right. Good night.
- Good night, dear.
Good night, Sue-Lin.
Thanks for coming over to see Sue-Lin, Miss Warren.
I'm glad I did.
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Sure. Right outside.
You've certainly been sweet to Sue-Lin.
Do you have any idea what happened to her uncle?
Not a clue.
There's nobody else to get in touch with because he's her only relative.
Mike, you know, you really should notify the Child Welfare Board.
No, I don't want to do that.
I'll care for her myself until her uncle comes back.
- But suppose he doesn't?
- He will.
- You'll keep her here until he does?
- Sure. I guess so.
I mean, if she wants to stay, why not?
You're a very remarkable guy.
Hubba, hubba!
I tell you, this place comes equipped with everything.
Knock it off, Danny.
Scusi, scusi. Tonight I'm very Italian.
- Tonight you're very drunk.
- Little snort of vino?
No, thank you.
Aren't you gonna introduce me?
Diane Warren, this is Danny Burke, my partner.
How do you do?
So you're the big attraction at the fair?
Quite an exhibit, old buddy.
Mike, I think I'd better be going.
All right, I'll get your things.
- It was very nice meeting you.
- No trouble. Drop by anytime, beautiful.
- You sure do brighten up the terrain.
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me, please.
- Yes, ma'am.
You don't have to leave on my account.
- I'll call you tomorrow at the dispensary.
- Please do.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
You didn't tell me she was put together like that.
Can't you tell a nice girl when you meet one?
Now he's a Cub Scout. What happened?
Somebody steal your wolf whistle?
Forget it. I just happen to feel a little different about Diane.
That's all we need.
Stone broke, our plane in hock, and you start smelling orange blossoms.
Buddy, this is not the time.
I'm sorry. You don't plan these things.
They just happen, you know.
What about our little old airplane, Bessie?
When we have our little old airplane back, she's all yours.
- You're gonna give up flying?
- Not exactly.
I've been thinking about signing up for something in the space program.
Space!
Beautiful. You'd be perfect.
You got a head full of it.
I never claimed to be the brains of this team.
You can say that again.
I got to check Sue-Lin.
Two bourbons on the rocks, thanks.
Two bourbons on the rocks for table three.
- Danny Burke!
- Hiya, gumdrop.
- When did you get in town?
- A couple of days ago.
- You didn't call me.
- I've been on a tight schedule.
But we'll make up for that.
I spoke to Vince on the phone, he said to meet him here.
Over here, Danny.
Hey, Vince!
Honey, as soon as I'm through with him, there's a favor I'd like to ask you.
This isn't a touch.
- You name it, Danny.
- I'll do that, doll-face.
See you later.
Sit down. How are the two boy aviators?
Grounded. How about yourself?
Slugging along.
I'm glad you called.
I got a job for you if you're interested.
A flying job?
Unless you're available for another kind.
No. We're still pilots, only our plane's on ice.
Again?
Our pal the sheriff put a padlock on it.
Little matter of the $1,200 we owe.
Think you could bail her out in time to run some freight to Canada tonight?
Sure, if we had the loot.
- You've got it.
- Come on.
I'll toss in another $200 when the work's finished. How about that?
Boy, you're a lifesaver. I've been racking my brain how to get Mike out of town.
He in some kind of a jam?
Woman trouble up to here.
But he doesn't think so.
I forgot the name of the mouse at the bar.
Lily.
Lily, yeah.
I've got to see her about a phone call.
Be right back.
- Hi, Mike!
- Hi, honey.
I'm sorry. Still no luck.
Sometimes I wonder if Uncle Walter's ever coming back.
Come on now, let's have some positive thinking around here.
But why would he go away and leave me all alone?
Alone? With friends like Danny,
Diane, and me?
That's right. I do have friends.
- I see you're making some new ones.
- New ones?
Sure.
Like the clown with the green face that looks like you.
- I don't have a green face.
- You don't now. You gave it to him.
- Mike, you're just teasing me.
- I'm not teasing.
He has got your face.
You feel better?
Clear the strip and start your motors.
- Hi, Danny.
- Hiya, cutie.
See how Tiger's doing.
And you, strap on your parachute, buddy, because we're airborne.
What's the word?
The word is money. $1,200.
Dauntless Daniel has done it again.
- Right.
With extra for incidentals.
We're out of the trenches, partner.
Where did you get $1,200?
It's an advance.
We got a job working for Vince Bradley.
What kind of a job?
Hauling some freight to Canada.
There's $200 more coming after delivery.
Why should that pirate be so nice to us?
It's a business proposition.
He needs transport.
- Lf he needs transport...
- Come on.
We gotta catch the 2:00 bus for Sherrington.
- And we'll say good-bye to Sue-Lin.
- Wait a minute. Who'll take care of her?
Barney can keep an eye on her.
We'll be back in a couple of hours.
Is it okay if Barney takes care of you for a few hours?
- Sure. I'll be a big girl.
- Okay, but...
- How do you do?
- How do you do? Mr. Michael Edwards?
- I'm Miss Ettinger. May I come in?
- Please do.
- "Child Welfare Board"?
- Yes.
- Would you sit down, please?
- Thank you.
- You must be Sue-Lin.
- Yes.
What do you want, Miss Ettinger?
I'm afraid Sue-Lin will have to come with me, Mr. Edwards.
I'm sorry.
But an abandoned child without any relatives automatically...
- becomes a ward of the county.
- But she's not abandoned, ma'am.
We're taking care of her till her uncle comes back.
There's no telling how long that will be.
You can see our position.
You're two bachelors... living in a trailer, neither of you employed.
Please, Mike, I don't wanna go.
Don't let her take me!
We were just hired for a job today, right, Danny?
And while you're doing it, who's going to take care of Sue-Lin?
It's rolling time, Danny boy. I got the dice!
Boys, we have company.
Excuse us. I'm sorry.
Let's go to my place.
Be reasonable, Mr. Edwards.
This is hardly a favorable environment for a child.
- She's right, Sue-Lin.
- I don't want to go.
I don't want you to either, honey, but I'm afraid you have to.
I love you. Do you love me?
You know I do.
They won't keep you very long, I promise.
I'll come up and see you every day.
When Uncle Walter comes back, we'll have a big party, all right?
Now, don't cry. Don't cry.
Go to get your things packed.
I'd better give them a hand.
- Good-bye, honey.
- Good-bye, Mike.
- Good-bye, Danny.
- So long, cutie.
- We'll take good care of her, Mr. Edwards.
- Yes, ma'am.
Before you go,
I wonder if you'd tell me something.
Yes, of course.
How did you know Sue-Lin was here?
A complaint was filed.
A complaint? By whom?
I guess you have a right to know.
Miss Diane Warren.
Diane?
Are you sure?
I received the phone call myself.
I take it you know her.
I thought I did.
I'm sorry, Mr. Edwards.
Good-bye, Mike. Good-bye, Danny.
- I don't want to go!
- Good-bye.
Good-bye, Sue-Lin.
Why did it have to be Diane?
That's the one thing I can't understand.
Why would she do a thing like this?
And I had to fall for her... a dame who goes around making everybody's decisions for them.
She must think she's got the only brain in town.
Anyway, I'm glad I got a good look at this side of her.
What time does that bus leave?
- Let's go.
Did you see that sheriff's face when we handed him that dough?
I bet he still thinks we printed it up ourselves.
Come on. Smile a little!
We'll be in Seattle soon.
We'll load up for Canada and it's off we go into the wild blue yonder, right?
Right.
We better check and see if Vince is here.
- You check. I'm gonna call Sue-Lin.
- Right.
Hello, I'd like to speak with Miss Ettinger, please.
Speaking.
This is Mike Edwards.
How is Sue-Lin getting along?
Mr. Edwards, where are you?
We thought Sue-Lin was with you.
With me? What are you talking about?
I'm at the airport.
- We just flew in.
- Airport?
Sue-Lin ran away this afternoon, and naturally...
Ran away?
I had to leave her in my office alone for a few minutes.
That's just dandy!
You're telling me I can't take care of a kid.
May I?
Mike, this is Diane.
What are you doing there?
Taking a bow for the mess you've made?
Mike, listen... Hello?
He wouldn't even listen.
I'm going to check with Mr. Barney Thatcher.
Danny, I gotta get into town.
You gotta get into town?
- Sue-Lin's run away.
- No, Vince will be here any minute.
You load up and I'll come back as soon as I can.
We got a job to do!
That'll be $5.60.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.
Barney, Sue-Lin ran away.
- Don't I know it, she was here.
- Where is she?
Why'd you let her go?
I never even laid eyes on her.
She left you a note.
- Come on, let's have it.
- I'm looking for it.
Come on, I gotta find her.
I didn't get that part, either.
What does she mean?
- She'll wait for you in her dream car.
- Her dream car.
Sure. Barney, can I use your station wagon?
Go.
- Don't say anything about the note.
- Mike, you think I'm a stoolie?
That welfare doll is back.
- Give me the keys.
- Go out the back.
- Remember, I wasn't here.
- Hurry up.
- Have you seen...
- Good evening, why should I lie?
I've got nothing to hide.
- Any sign of him?
- I told you he had to run an errand.
What do you mean, run an errand?
Keep your shirt on, Vince, he'll be right back.
He'd better, or you're going without him.
All right, come on, let's load the plane.
Sue-Lin!
What are you doing here?
Mike, I knew you'd come!
You've got half of Seattle looking for you.
I don't mean to be bad, Mike, but don't let them take me back again.
Okay, we'll play it your way.
Let's get out of here.
- Where are we going?
- The airport. We got our plane back.
Who's in there? Who's in here?
Let's go. Jump.
Hey, you!
- You two!
- Let's go.
Hold it!
Stop!
Stop them.
They got us surrounded.
Let's get out of here.
- Don't let him get away!
- Head him off!
Don't let him get away!
Stop!
Hurry, Mr. Mike! They're coming! Hurry!
Hurry, Mike!
All right. I'm hurrying.
Hold it!
- Hang on.
- Mike, hurry!
Come on.
Now look, you've stalled long enough.
Now get this crate rolling.
Listen, Vince, I'm superstitious.
I can't leave without Mike.
I'm superstitious, too, and you're leaving without Mike.
Get that thing closed. Lock it up.
- Get rid of her.
- Mike!
Danny, where is Mike?
He went to town to look for the kid.
I don't expect him back.
Happy landings to me.
Are you flying somewhere tonight?
That's right. See you around.
- Without Mike?
- Sure. Why not?
Mike. Sue-Lin.
Mike, please.
- It's about time.
- Okay.
Mike, you have to believe me.
I did not report Sue-Lin to the welfare department.
- What is this, a PTA meeting?
- Who's he?
Shut your trap. Mike, you're late.
Let's get moving.
- Okay, just don't panic. Come on.
- Without the kid.
What do you mean, what difference does it make?
She's a fugitive. I don't want cops crawling around here.
- Why not?
- Never mind why not.
Blue Eyes can take care of her until you come back.
How did you get roped into this?
Smuggling furs. The deal's off.
- You heard him, Vince, the deal's off.
- Guess again, Danny.
- Now get over there!
- You're a big man, Danny.
Now you two rover boys listen close.
I bailed out this mix master for you.
Now you're gonna bail me out.
The kid stays. Come here, kid!
You, too, Blue Eyes!
Come on, we haven't got all night.
They stay until you come back... and hand me a certain envelope, clear?
All right, get moving. Come on, move!
Get out of the way!
- Look out!
- Mike!
No! No more!
Danny. Come on, boy, get up.
Danny! It's me, Mike!
Come on, snap out of it.
Come on, Miss Diane! It's the police!
Mike, it's the police. We better run.
No, honey. We've stopped running.
Take care of him.
What's going on here?
How long are they gonna keep that little kid in there?
Now you're concerned about the little kid.
I was concerned before.
That's why I got rattled and reported her to welfare.
You got rattled.
I was well intended.
I wasn't trying to hurt Diane.
- Then why did you use her name?
- Sounded more official from a nurse.
Listen, I'll make it up to you.
When we go see that lieutenant... let me do the talking.
- I noticed you're very good at it.
- It's application, that's all.
No mystery. Even you could do it.
Do me a favor.
Just don't help me.
I'm sorry, Diane.
- Can you forgive me?
- Of course.
- How about me?
- That may take a little longer.
Mike, they found Uncle Walter!
That's great, honey. I told you they would.
The report just came through on the Teletype.
What happened? Where is he?
In a little emergency hospital
20 miles south of here.
His truck went out of control and skidded into the Sound.
Is he gonna be all right?
They say when the bump on his head goes down, he'll be good as new.
Mike, please...
Lieutenant, one final thing.
You, too, Miss Ettinger.
It concerns this sweet innocent child.
There's no further problem...
I realize you have a job to do and rules are rules.
But after all, it's not as if she were a common criminal.
When Sue-Lin ran away, it was out of fear, anxiety.
She wanted to be with her friends, her loved ones.
I take it you have a family, Lieutenant?
- Yes, I have.
- A wife, children.
- You, too, Miss Ettinger?
- I'm not married.
- Well, Mike, I...
- He's gone.
Miss Ettinger, you're supposed to be a welfare worker. Comfort me.
After I return Sue-Lin to her uncle.
- Good-bye, Danny.
- Good-bye, Mr. Burke.
Thank you, Mr. Edwards.
We'll notify you as soon as your application clears.
Thank you, sir.

- Sounds potable. Thank you, Andre.
- Yes, an excellent year.
Let me see, there was...
Rachel and Marie... and Rachel again.
That was a beautiful year.
For me, 1882 was more memorable.
That long ago?
No, no. No, you don't. Other people might buy your wistful retired-from-life act, but not me.
I happen to know about a certain lady on the Rue Avignon.
Well, one tries to stay amused.
And one succeeds, no?
# We are maidens typical of France

Don't point. It's rude.
- Charming. That is Simone?
- No, no. That is Claudine.
I'm saving her for a rainy day.
But she is not Simone.
This Simone, has she anything to do with the surprise you promised me?
- She certainly has.
- Good. I love surprises.
So does Simone.
In fact, she'll hardly speak to me if I show up without one.
Andre.
Simone. I'd know your perfume anywhere.
Francois! Diamonds!
- Well, some of them.
- Beautiful.
Think she'll like it?
She's very particular, Fifi.
Fifi? Fifi-who-Fifi?!
You airways tease. Put it on.
Go on, hurry, put it on.
Then introduce me to your friend.
No, no, no, take your time, Francois.
I'm in no hurry.
AIIez-oop.
Oh, Francois!
You'll never know how grateful I am.
Yes, I will.
Jewellery on my garter.
Makes me feel irresistible.
Oh, mademoiselle, resistance to you is unthinkable.
And un-French.
It's a shame, though - no one will see it.
I wish I could believe that.
This is Monsieur Barriere, this is Mademoiselle Simone.
- Delighted, mademoiselle.
- I've heard so much about you.
- Lies, all lies.
- No, no, nice things from Francois.
Oh, but Francois is a gentleman.
You know what I'm doing?
I'm sitting on diamonds.
Imagine me sitting on diamonds.
It's quite a sensation.
- Simone.
- Oh. This is bad?
No, but it's not the sort of thing done in royal circles.
Say, what's holding up the you-know?
The cancan. It'll be there in a minute.
- The cancan?
- That was the surprise. She spoiled it.
Now, now, now, wait a minute.
The cancan is against the law.
You know that, Francois.
- You mean you don't want to see it?
- Of course I do. Who doesn't?
But a man in my position, if it becomes known that I watched the cancan...
What does the law call it?
''A lewd and lascivious performance.''
What could I say?
How could I defend myself?
You needn't worry.
No one will ever know.
- But suppose the police arrive?
- The police will not arrive.
- Do you think I'd have you caught in a raid?
- Francois has taken care of the police.
Believe me, I cannot afford to have this place of mine closed.
- You are sure?
- I am 2,000-francs-worth sure.
Well, I cannot approve officially, but...
What are we waiting for?
Good.
See? I told you, they never arrest the waiters.
Francois, this could have been very bad.
I don't understand it.
Ow!
Simone!
I will bite you again and again!
You told me everything was arranged!
- It was arranged!
- Then someone must have re-arranged it.
The Police Correctional Court is now in session.
It wpll be noted for the record that today Judge Merceaux and myself wpll be joined by a colleague transferred to this court from the 14th arrondissement.
I am most pleased to welcome
Judge Forrestier to our judicial family.
Thank you. It is a privilege to become a member of such a distinguished family.
First case. Bring in the accused.
Order!
- The accused wpll remember where they are.
- Who could forget?
Where is the attorney for the defence?
I'm coming, Your Honour.
You are late.
I am sorry, Monsieur le President. I spent the night in... consultation with a client.
Let us proceed with the charges.
The prisoners are charged with violation of the Pubic Morals Law of 1790, in that they did wilfully perform a lewd and lascivious dance calculated to inflame the minds, souls and moral fibres of the spectators.
We did?
Gudge bangs gavel)
May I ask who filed this complaint?
We did, Monsieur le President. We represent the League Against Filthy Dancing.
Are you aware that all complaints must be signed by an official of the court?
It was signed, Monsieur le President.
It was? By whom?
- By me, Your Honour.
- By you?
Why, yes. It was a complaint brought by responsible citizens.
Oh.
And this is the complaint that you signed?
Yes, it is.
Well then, since the complaint is in order, we will proceed with the trial.
- Where is the prosecuting attorney?
- He is ill, Your Honour. Confined to his home.
That's true.
I saw him an hour ago - he's gravely ill.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry to hear it.
Are there any witnesses?
No, Your Honour.
Your Honour, since the prosecutor's absent and there are no witnesses to the said dance,
I propose a dismissal.
One moment, Your Honour, please.
Where are the officers who made this arrest?
Summon the arresting officers.
- There are only two of them present.
- Where are the others?
Your Honour, this is not a very important case, so we didn't think...
Since when do the poIice decide which cases are important?
But...
When you made the arrest did you see any of the dancing?
No, monsieur.
I was outside, guarding the exit.
- And you? Were you inside?
- Oui, monsieur.
- Then you saw the dancing?
- I object.
With all due respect, he is presupposing a fact.
- Objection sustained.
- I shall rephrase the question.
- Did you see the dancing?
- Non, monsieur.
Why not? You admit you were there.
But I have trouble with my eyes.
I suffer with an ailment. It is called...
- Perjury, maybe?
- Just a moment.
I object to that as being an unjust and irresponsible accusation.
Your Honour, I know this good man, and I happen to know he suffers from a severe case of astigmatism.
Yes, astigatism, yes.
Sustained.
When you made the arrest surely you took down testimony from witnesses?
Your Honour, did you ever try to take down testimony while arresting a cancan dancer?
Now, really. I suppose you also failed to collect any witnesses' names?
Yes, Your Honour.
Because in the struggle I lost my pencil.
This is astounding. Obviously not one of you is performing his duties properly, or you'd offer some kind of evidence for a conviction.
Since it is the learned magistrate's opinion that there is no evidence for a conviction,
I move that the case be dismissed.
- Any objection?
- No objection.
Judge Forrestier?
Well, Your Honour, under the circumstances...
Case dismissed. Recess.
All right, girls, come on...
Very good.
Very good.
Mademoiselle, perhaps a little closer to...
- But by all means, monsieur.
- No, no, no, no.
We were asked to do this for the newspapers, not for postcards.
HoId it.
Arh!
- Where'd everybody go?
- No, no, no! You wiggle, all of you!
You wpll have to hold still.
Ah, Judge Forrestier. Hello.
My friend the defence lawyer.
What a pleasant surprise.
- I planned to visit you in your chambers.
- A business matter?
No, to get acquainted with the new judge.
I'm a friendly type.
And you like to have friends at court, so to speak?
It's a little early, but my clients and I were celebrating. Won't you join us?
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
- But they're such lovely clients.
- Yes, they are indeed.
And they don't hold this morning against you.
They like you very much. Don't you, ladies?
- CertainIy.
- Not me.
You see? They love you.
We may never get along, you and I, but we certainly won't if you take me for a fool.
- I take people as I find them.
- Yes, I know you do. I've met your type.
Nothing matters but having a good time.
I know you very well.
When I think of the things you're missing - the wonderful...
Oh, yes, wonderful, wonderful.
Wine from a lady's slipper.
Dawn in a strange bed.
Intoxicating intrigue. Romance.
Romance in gay Paris.
Spare me the rest of the cliches, wpll you?
I never thought I'd hear a Frenchman say things are more important than romance.
Unfortunately, some things are more important.
How can you ignore love when so many of your countrymen have died for it?
As you know, duelling is against the law.
That's true. But...
# The law must be tempered with reason
# Not to love should be considered treason
Nonsense.
# When love comes in
# And takes you for a spin
# Ooh-la-la-la
# C'est magnifique
# When every night
# Your loved one holds you tight
# Ooh-la-la-la
# C'est magnifique
# But when one day
# Your loved one drifts away
# Ooh-la-la-la

Ah, that was a good one!
Very... very instructive.
Ladies, you are now immortal.
We must go now. Come, come.
- Your Honour, I bid you good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
Oh, I have one question. If you plan on being a monk, why don't you shave your head?
And if you want to be what you want to be, why bother to be a lawyer?
Has anyone ever told you that ajudge needn't be ajudge 24 hours a day?
- Good afternoon, monsieur.
- Afternoon, Jacques. Keep your lens clean.
- Evening, Your Honour.
- Is the wagon here?
- Yes, monsieur. Back out of the way.
- Fine.
We wpll enter separately.
You wpll sit with him.
When you see me remove this flower from my
IapeI and drop it, take the picture. All right?
Yes, sir.
As soon as the flash goes off, that's your signal to start the raid.
- Understood, sir.
- We will be ready, sir.
Table six. Never saw him before.
Couldl be a detective.
ShaII I throw him out?
No. He might be a real customer.
- You stay close. I will go see.
- Mm-hm.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
- You'd like to buy me a drink?
- By all means.
- My name is Simone.
- Mine is Marcel. Marcel Ayonais.
- You've not been here before, no?
- To my regret.
- What wpll you have?
- Champagne?
- Perrier-Jouet 1887.
- Yes, monsieur.
You must be very rich, no?
As Chateaubriand said, the state rests upon the acquiescence of the poor.
That settles that - you're certainly no detective.
Were you expecting one?
When one runs an establishment such as this, one has to be careful.
- I can imagine.
- What do you mean?
Only that detectives are like everyone else - always trying to take advantage of a poor vulnerable girl.
It's the truth. You have no idea what I go through here. Smoke?
No, thank you.
- You mind if I do?
- No.
- Does it shock you?
- Not at all.
But isn't it bad for the lungs?
What do you think?
In my profession, I never give an opinion without examining the evidence.
- What is your profession?
- Wine taster.
- Bordeaux?
- No, Limoges.
- Limoges?!
- Don't make a face.
Everyone can't be born in Paris.
I like you.
You could not afford not to like your customers.
I'm a businesswoman, but not at this moment.
Then maybe you will do me a favour.
- I just became a businesswoman again.
- This is a business favour.
I was told I might see the cancan here - the real cancan.
Is that true?
If not, I will try somewhere else.
You see, I have only this one night in Paris.
- You will see it.
- Oh, I don't believe you.
- Why not, you don't believe me?
- You could not get away with it.
This place doesn't make enough money to bribe all the policemen in Paris.
Foolish man! It doesn't take money.
- Really?
- No, of course not.
The district chief is mad for Helene - she's one of my girls.
You will find the brigadier around Genevieve's little finger.
True, sometimes we must pay money, but more often than not... a kiss, a little wine.
- It's that simple?
- Simple?
It takes much organisation to find out who wants which from whom and who wants who.
Then as soon as I get my list competed, some stinker switches the whole brigade to another precinct.
I'm from Limoges.
So?
A list of what it takes to bribe every gendarme in the district - no one could have such a list.
I'm from Limoges, but that doesn't make me a tourist.
You sound like you'd like to make a little wager.
- 1,000 francs.
- 1,000 francs?!
It's perfectly all right. I will...
What...
- Do you do this every night?
- No, no, no. We're closed on Sundays.
Why are you in Montmartre? You're good enough for Les Ambassadeurs or Maxim's.
- You been to those places?
- Of course not.
- About this 1,000 francs now...
- Hm? Yes?
Still want to make a little bet?
Show me the list and it's yours.
For 1,000 francs, I'd show you anything!
Well, almost anything.
Come with me.
I will get it. This way.
- The judge!
- It is!
Come in.
This is my boudoir. It's also my office.
I do most of my work here.
No one knows how to open this safe but me, and I always forget the combination.
Why don't you write it down on a piece of paper?
I tried that once.
But where would I hide it?
I put it in between... down here, but somehow it got into unfriendly hands.
Well, then put it under your mattress.
It ought to be safe there.
I knew I liked you.
- Mademoiselle Simone.
- Yes, Andre?
Pardon me, monsieur.
I must speak to you immediately.
- One moment.
- No, immediately.
I said one moment.
I'm about to win 1,000 francs.
- Mademoiselle...
- There, that's got it.
- What are you doing?
- You must come with me right now.
- Andre, are you crazy?
- It is of vital importance.
- What'd you do that for?
- You don't want to leave it open, I'm sure.
All right, if it's that important.
Pardon me one moment.
Simone...
- What is it?
- Do you know who you've got in there?
A gentleman from Limoges.
He made me a wager.
No! That's Judge Forrestier, the man who signed the complaint against us.
- That's ridiculous. It can't be.
- But it is.
- There is no doubt.
- What's he been saying to you?
He just made me a little wager that I didn't have a list of the gendarmes...
Oh.
Oh, he's a clever one!
Andre, you'd better tell them to hold the cancan.
What are you going to do?
Work on him.
Work on him. What else?
I hope it wasn't bad news.
No. Not really.
I should've expected it.
- Can I help in any way?
- Oh, no, thank you.
It's too late now.
Thank you just the same.
You don't want to settle the bet?
I'd like to see that mythical list of yours.
Let's forget about the list tonight.
Besides, the news I just heard has driven the combination right out of my head.
It must have been very distracting news.
That's putting it midly.
What are you staring at?
Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
There's not much point in my staying any longer, is there?
Do you mean to say all you care about is my list?
That's not very flattering.
With a face like that, you should not.
- What's the matter with my face?
- It's a mirror.
It betrays every thought that goes on behind it.
I was just thinking I should get out of these silly clothes. Will you wait?
Are you sure you want me to?
But of course.
We're just beginning to know each other.
It's draughty in here. Do you think you'd be able to close my window?
Certainly.
Good.
It's funny, I've never met a man who could close that window.
I don't know why it seems so important to me.
I even dream about it sometimes.
- Why don't you get a carpenter?
- I don't think I'd be happy with a carpenter.
Simone?
- Oh, excuse me.
- It's all right. She's in there.
- Who was that?
- I think a musician. I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
How are you doing with that window?
- You still need a carpenter.
- I thought so.
- You like it?
- Very becoming.
Can you do up my back?
Certainly.
- Something bothering you?
- No.
Why? Are my hands coId?
A little.
I'm sorry if they feel unpleasant.
I didn't say that.
Simone, you know who I am, and I know that you know.
Now, you're a nice, hard-working girl with a bright head.
Why do you insist on fighting the authorities?
You're not equipped to fight them.
You almost let a total stranger trick you into giving up a vital piece of evidence.
A girl that naive has no chance against the police.
I don't care. I think it's a stupid law.
What harm can a simple little folk dance...
- Folk dance?!
- Yes!
- It can close your cafe and put you in jaiI.
- Only because of people like you.
Why do you come in here and sneak around like some detective? It's not your business.
- Bribed policemen are my business.
- Then go arrest them and leave me alone.
Simone. Simone, you're silly.
The people like the cancan. They come here and expect to see it, so I give it to them.
What are you doing?
Feeling sorry for you.
Forgive me. I... I don't know why I did that.
You could not help it. Could you?
# When love comes in
# And takes you for a spin
# Ooh-la-la-la
# C'est magnifique
No, no, please, not again.
# When every night your loved one holds you tight
# Ooh-la-la-la
# C'est magnifique
Why must I be bombarded by this song?
# But when one day
# Your loved one drifts away
# Ooh-la-la-la
- C'est magnifique?
- No.
# It is so tragique
# But when once more
# He whispers...
# ''Je t'adore''
# C'est magnifique
Do you still want to arrest me?
I never did. And now less than ever.
What would you like to do with me?
I haven't decided.
I think you have.
Perhaps you're right.
- If only I could trust you.
- Trust me how?
Not to hurt me.
As long as I have a choice,
I would never hurt you.
- Mademoiselle?
- Yes, Andre?
May I see you for a moment?
Oh, I'm a businesswoman again.
If you wait downstairs,
I will join you there in one minute.
- Please do. We have much to taIk about.
- I will hang on every word.
- Well?
- My first judge.
The girls are all ready.
Shall I cancel the dance?
No, of course not. From now on we have nothing to worry about.
Good, good.
Arturo's waiting for instructions.
- Thank you, jailer.
- Sir.
You look like a broken umbrella.
Oh, come, come.
I'm your lawyer. You can talk to me.
Where have you been?
Now, now. I've brought bail.
I will have you out of here in ten minutes.
12 hours! 12 hours you let me sit here!
Where were you at 4am?
I sent a messenger to your apartment.
I was there all the time. I didn't hear a thing.
You know I'm a sound sleeper.
You were with some silly little model?
You know, you are a lousy lawyer and an unreliable lover.
I am not a lousy lawyer.
But I do have an idiot for a client.
Putting on an illegal performance before a police-courtjudge who's sitting there roosting right at a ringside table.
And you knew he was ajudge because Claudine told you he was.
- Well, he lied to me.
- So what? You've known liars before.
What made you so gullible all of a sudden?
His big brown eyes?
Well, I...
I believed him because I thought he liked me.
Oh, you did? So that's what's been going on behind my back.
Oh, it was business! I hate him!
It was business.
Shrewd business.
May cost you 10,000 francs.
Plus losing your licence for about two weeks.
That's pretty expensive goo-goo eyes you've been roiling.
- Ah. You're letting her out?
- Judge Forrestier wants her brought to him.
- Who cares what Judge Forrestier wants!
- Shh, shh, shh. Shh.
Are you sure that the good judge asked for her personally?
Yes, like I told you.
Come along.
- Let go of me!
- Shut up. Shut up, Simone.
I need a little more time with my client for consultation. I will call you in a second.
As you say.
I smell an opening. I think that fish-eyed law book is worried about something.
Now, if you will be honest with me,
I will show you how we can save 10,000 francs.
- I'm always honest with you.
- Fine.
I want every possible detail, whatever happened last night.
Did he kiss you?
Francois! How can you say that?
- Do you want to save 10,000?
- Yes, he kissed me.
Where did he kiss you?
- On the lips.
- No, no. I mean in the boudoir...
Francois!
I'm your lawyer.
You can say anything you want to me.
- That's a privileged communication.
- What's that?
That means nobody wpll ever know what you said except you and your lawyer.
Not even me - well, personally, that is.
- Look, I swear I will never throw it up to you.
- It wasn't that terrible.
All right. Now, I want to know every fact around how he behaved.
I will be him. What happened?
- You sit here.
- There? Mm-hm.
I, uh...
I was... sitting on his lap.
Oh, fine.
- And that's when the kiss happened.
- Well, come on, show me.
No, no, no, no.
Exactly... the full time of the kiss.
Hold it, hold it.
Where were his hands?
I don't think he had his hands on me.
I can believe that.
Obviously that ball of fire had his hands in his pockets.
Now, you were seated on his lap like this and the kiss lasted for about five seconds. Right?
That's right. I'm sorry.
- If I only had a reliable witness.
- A witness...
Andre came in. He saw us.
- Are you sure?
- Yes. He spoke to us.
You just saved yourself 10,000 francs.
Jailer!
- What are you going to do?
- Get fixed up best you can. I will be right back.
Don't go away.
Yes?
- Oh, come in. Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Can you spare me a moment?
- Certainly.
Thank you.
What can I do for you, sir?
First, not be so formal.
- Drop the ''sir''?
- Please.
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.
Yes?
There was an interesting item in the paper this morning.
- About the Bal du Paradis?
- Mm.
- Apparently it has been raided again.
- Apparently.
I knew this was going to be difficult.
Then let me say it for you.
You want me to be lenient.
My friend, the bestjudge is the one who judges as little as possible.
I agree.
Don't you ever drink a little too much wine and chase after young ladies who are known to run slowly?
Look, I may not go dancing up and down the Champs-Elysees, but privately I have as much fun as any Frenchman in Paris.
Privately?
Yes. I don't see the need to prove to the whole world that I'm having a good time.
And I do?
No, that's not for me to judge.
It's a matter of taste.
Oh, I see.
Now you're ajudge of taste.
- You make me feel ancient.
- Really?
It seems so long ago that I felt
I had to teach everyone how to live.
But doesn't someone have to teach them?
No, Your Honour.
# You just have to let them live... and let live
# Be, and let be
# Hear, and let hear
# See, and let see
# Sing, and let sing
# Dance, and let dance
- # I like Offenbach
- I do not.
# So what, so what, so what?
# Write, and let write
# Read, and let read
# Love, and let love
# Breed, and let breed
# Live, and let live
# And remember this line:
# Your business is your business and my business is mine
Sometimes I think all conversations ought to be sung.
It's so hard to quarrel with a melody.
If you listen carefully, you will find it just as hard to quarrel with the world.
- # Live, and let live
- Live and let live.
- # Do, and let do
- Do and let do.
- # Hear, and let hear
- All right, but sue and let sue.
- # What for? Drink, and let drink
- If you can hold it.
# PIay, and let play
- Within limits. But I think you overdo it.
- I do not.
# So what, so what, so what?
# Pray, and let pray?
# Sure, but slip and let slip
# Dress, and let dress
# That's fine, but strip and let strip
- # Live and let live
- # Live and let live
# And remember this line:
- # Your business...
- # Is my business
- # And your business...
- # Is mine
# Your business is your business and my business is mine
Paul, you are right. As a matter of fact...
I should have told you this earlier, but Durnais' client doesn't need any leniency.
I've decided early this morning that...
Pardon me. Come in.
You sent for me, you marvellous man!
Oh.
- Simone, may I introduce...
- Good morning, Monsieur Barriere.
How do you do, Simone?
- You two know each other?
- Uh...
- You two know each other?
- We certainly do.
This is the nicest thing that's ever happened to me.
Now, be still.
Just for one minute you will be still?
Excellent.
Oh. I see.
- Did you get it?
- Perfect.
Good!
Ah, my dear Paul.
It would seem your friend the crusader is in a bit of ajam.
Francois! These are magistrates' chambers.
You're acting in contempt.
- Call it disgust.
- Francois.
No, Paul. I know what I'm doing.
I doubt it. That picture, for instance. You wpll not be permitted to leave the building with it.
- No?
- No.
Well, if I cannot get it out, apparently it wpll do me no good, wpll it?
Emile!
Someone caught it.
I don't know who it is, of course.
Does this man really want to be disbarred?
He has me worried.
Why do you imagine you can behave like this to a magistrate?
Ah, but he's not a magistrate now.
He's a defendant.
A defendant, am I?
What an inventive fellow he is.
- May I know the charge?
- The charge.
Oh, I don't know...
Invasion of privacy, breach of promise...
Anything that'II give us a chance to tell our story to the papers.
- I'm sure they will find it interesting.
- They certainly wpll.
They can illustrate it with that picture
I could not get out of the building.
Francois, you'd better have a good excuse for your conduct. What's the story?
Yes, I'm curious too.
Mademoiselle Pistache, give the gentlemen an idea of what happened.
Yes.
He offered me 1,000 francs to take him to my boudoir and show him something he had absolutely no business seeing.
Then he forced his attentions on me.
I fought and struggled and pleaded, but to absolutely no avail.
- He had the strength of a thousand devils!
- A compliment at last.
Then it was quite clear that if I didn't submit to his evil desires, he'd use his power to persecute me!
Well, what could I do?
Submit, by all means.
Submit?! Submit?
- Never! Never in a thousand years wpll I...
- Simone. Simone, Simone.
Just a generaI idea.
We will write the story later.
Yes.
So I... Well, I refused and I went to jail.
What happened to the strength of a thousand devils? Did I weaken?
- My virtue robbed you of your strength.
- We must remember that line.
It's a good story, isn't it? Simple, classical, vivid... The public wpll eat it up.
Probably. It's certain to embarrass me, at the very least.
- And what do you plan to do about it?
- To Simone, nothing. She's a nice girl.
She isn't capable of inventing all that dirty nonsense.
But you I shall have disbarred and indicted.
You should change your mind.
When you do, let me know.
Just a second. Simone...
The reason I sent for you is that I made a mistake last night.
- PauI, you're a witness.
- Be quiet, wpll you?
I said I wold not hurt you if I had a choice.
You misunderstood me.
You thought I was promising immunity.
That was why you presented the cancan, and why you thought I lied to you.
- Don't talk, Simone.
- Yes, don't talk, he's right. Just listen.
I was stupid to have made a statement you could so easily misinterpret. That's all.
And for that reason, I'm going to withdraw my complaint against you.
- You're what?
- That's very prudent of you.
As you know, PauI, my decision was made early this morning.
I know you well enough to accept that.
And your decision could not please me more.
Thank you.
Do you mean I can keep my 10,000 francs and my cafe stays open?
Yes.
- Francois! Francois, you're a genius!
- Of course. I've known it all the time.
Goodbye, children.
I'm delighted no blood was shed.
- Come on, let's celebrate.
- Francois...
WouId you wait for me a moment?
I'd like to thank Judge Forrestier.
All right, but keep your guard up.
I'm awfully sorry I thought you were a prune.
You're forgiven.
And I'm sorry I lies about last night.
At least you now have a picture of us - or Emile has.
Maybe you could get me a copy.
I was right last night, wasn't I?
I knew I liked you.
Thank you.
Uh...
Here's a kiss I really mean.
''The State versus Simone Pistache.''

Francois...
You have my undivided attention.
You know, I'm... growing fonder and fonder of you every day.
Mm, that's nice.
Tell me something.
You thinking about the same thing I am?
I was thinking about marriage.
- Went down the wrong way.
- It always goes down the wrong way.
Will you please tell me why?
I will tell you why.
Because I'd much rather be in love with you than marry you.
Could not we arrange to do both?
No, sweetheart, we can't, if you want to be realistic.
Look, in my opinion the biggest reason in the world today for infidelity is marriage.
Eliminate marriage, and you will never see any such thing as an unfaithful husband.
Cut off your legs so you will never have flat feet.
Go ahead, be funny. I thought you wanted to discuss this seriously.
I do, but eliminate marriage?!
We can't discuss it seriously then.
Well, let me finish.
- I'm the lawyer, right?
- Yes.
Now, I see the seamy side of marriage - the point where it's beginning to break up.
In each case the history's exactly the same - after about a year's time the man discovers another girl.
Now, he can't spend much time with his new puff because he'd have to lie to his wife.
So what does he do? He lies.
And then he feels guilty, and he doesn't want to see his wife any more because he doesn't like feeling guilty.
So two people who were once in love with each other are now separated, unhappy and miserable.
And why? Because they were stupid enough to get married in the first place.
It's beyond me.
Guess I never really thought of it that way.
It's the only way to think about it, darling.
Direct, straight from the shoulder.
Oh, you monster! The way you twist everything around to get your own way!
- Well, it makes sense, doesn't it?
- No, it doesn't. Not to me.
Of course it does, sweetheart.
Why get married and lose each other?
Let's just be in love. It's more fun.
Everybody does it.
Why, even in France the best upper sets do it.
# Lithuanians and Letts do it
# Let's do it
# Let's fall in love
- Oh, I've heard that before.
- # In old Japan all the Japs do it
# Up in Lapland, little Laps do it
# Let's do it
# Let's fall in love
I know.
# The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
# Not to mention the Fins
# Folks in Siam do it
# Think of Siamese twins
# In shallow shoals
English soles do it
# Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
# Let's do it
# Let's fall in love
# The chimpanzees in the zoos do it
# Some courageous kangaroos do it
# Let's do it
# Let's fall in love
# I'm sure giraffes on the sly do it
# Even eagles as they fly do it
# Let's do it
# Let's fall in love
# Electric eels, I might add, do it
# Though it shocks 'em, I know
Argh!
# Why ask if shad do it?
# Garcon, the shad roe
# The world admits bears in pits do it
# Even Pekingeses at the Ritz do it
# Let's do it
# Let's fall in love
# The royal set sans regret did it
# And they considered it fun
# Marie Antoinette did it
# With or without Napoleon
# Parliament, pleasure-bent, did it
# Mademoiselles, every time they're short of rent, did it
# Let's do it
# Let's fall in love
- Well, how much did we lose last night?
- Not too bad, mademoiselle.
We will never get this place paid for.
What's this?
200 francs just for sugar?
- The pastry cook, you will have to speak to him.
- Speak to him? I will bake him!
What's this chromo?
TouIouse-Lautrec.
It's yours, mademoiselle.
You didn't? Not again!
But he is a fine painter. And he didn't eat much - 3 francs, 40 centimes.
I don't care, Andre. I want the money.
I have a cellar full of this trash!
- Hello again.
- Oh, hello.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.
- Will that be all?
- Yes, Andre.
Bring me the accounts as soon as you've balanced them.
- I certainly wasn't expecting company.
- You look very nice.
Thank you, but I'm sure I look a fright.
What are you doing here?
I don't know.
Is anything wrong? We won't do the cancan for a while, if that's what's worrying you.
- Oh, I'm not worried.
- Not worried...
Well, would you like to have a drink?
No, thank you.
All I'd like right now is to ask you a question.
Will you have dinner with me tonight?
Oh...
I'm terribly sorry, but I have an engagement.
Could not you break it?
You wold not want me to have trouble with my gentleman friend, would you?
Of course not. Of course.
I'm very sorry.
It's quite all right.
Good afternoon.
Afternoon.
Simone?
- Don't you ever knock?
- But... there's no door.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I suppose I do wear less when I'm dancing.
- Simone, about your engagement tonight...
- Yes?
I could meet you afterwards.
Say, about eleven.
I'm sorry, itjust wold not work out.
- Twelve, then?
- No, really, I can't.
Well...
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
- Simone!
- Argh!
Simone, I can't stand it. You are not going out with another man. I won't allow it.
Judge Forrestier, please! I'm not dressed!
- Never mind that. Answer my question.
- What question? Will you please...
I love you! I love you.
That's the question.
- And you will answer it before I leave this room.
- Answer what? How?
Don't pretend you don't know what to say when a man says he loves and wants you.
Oh, I see. A proposition.
Say you don't love anyone else.
Swear you never wpll love anyone else.
Take your hands off me.
The way you men maul me, just because I run a cafe!
It's insulting, that's what it is.
It's insulting.
Look, Simone, you're taking to a man who's been a bachelor for 32 proud years.
I've resisted marriage all this time.
Now you come along,
I get stuck, I can't sleep,
I'm asking you to marry me, and you call it insulting?
What, please, would you consider a compliment?!
- You mean you're asking me to marry you?
- Yes! Yes, I am! I am!
I don't understand it, but I am.
With my whole heart I'm asking you.
Pardon me, I have to sit down.
I've never had a proposal before - of marriage, I mean.
I like that. I like that very much.
It shows I'm the only smart man in the world.
- A genuine proposal...
- Yes.
I was beginning to think it might never happen.
Oh, now wait. I don't really know you.
I don't know you any better.
That's what makes it fascinating.
Madame Forrestier...
It is a loveIy name.
Perfect.
Oh, you must be out of your mind.
Madame Forrestier, don't talk, please.
Hold still.
- For you to ask me to marry you is crazy.
- It's the craziest thing I've ever done.
But Judge Forrestier...
Oh, my. What's your first name?
Philippe. Do you like it?
Philippe... Yes.
Oh, but I must be honest,
I haven't fallen in love with you.
Of course not. You admitted learn.
- That's what engagements are for.
- But I'm in love with someone else.
Naturally. Everyone falls in love once or twice before they get married.
You will forget him in no time.
Oh, but you're ajudge.
You're ajudge and so respectable.
I'm just... a dance-hall girl.
Are you a liar? Are you cheap?
Are you a thief?
- Of course not!
- Then you're respectable and decent.
You're as good as anyone on earth and better than most - and I will never let you forget it.
Oh.
Oh, I think maybe
I could fall in love with you.
Simone...
We are going...
Simone, what a good time we're going to have.
Now, I will call for you in an hour.
We will have dinner at Avenonville.
Oh, and by the way, from now on never entertain a man in a towel, hm?
Oh.
- Good afternoon.
- Same to you, my good fellow.
Thank you.
Hey there, first prize.
Where's my French pastry?
- What are you doing?
- Francois...
- What was that hanging judge doing here?
- Francois...
He had an awful hot gleams in that cold eye of his.
Were you sitting around here in that thing while he was here?
- Yes. Francois?
- What do you want?
Will you marry me?
You'd better refresh me again.
Didn't we settle that question wearier?
I suppose we did.
I can't have dinner with you tonight,
I don't want to see you any more, and I don't want you as my lawyer.
Hold it. I can understand you're trying to break a date, but let's not get carried away.
I mean everything I'm saying.
Let me see. I left you at 3:30 and we were in love. It's now 5:30.
I understand that these things don't last a lifetime, but should not it taper off a bit?
Will you not argue, please?
What could've happened between then and now?
I haven't lost weight, no scandal in the papers, my pants aren't on backwards...
Don't talk about pants in front of me!
I'm respectable.
- What's wrong with the word ''pants''?
- You said it again!
Now listen, I'm not cheap,
I'm not a liar and I'm not a thief.
I want to be treated with respect.
Are you taking to me or are you making a speech?
Look, something is obviously upsetting you.
If you tell me about it, I will try to fix it for you.
I find that highly amusing!
You'll fix it for me? Pardon my mirth.
What'd you do, swallow a flute?
It might interest you to know that I am going to marry.
- Congratulations. Anybody in particular?
- Very particular.
Don't use that old trick on me.
Women have tried to use that before - telling me they're marrying someone to put the pressure on me.
If I'd fallen for that,
I'd have been hooked twelve times.
- You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
- I just know what I know.
You might also be interested to know his name.
It happens to be Judge Philippe Forrestier.
Don't say that, even in fun.
So please take your departure, my good man, or I may have to summon aid.
You know, I believe it's true.
You're even beginning to sound like him.
Simone, if you want to jump off a bridge,
I won't stand in your way.
But I won't let you marry this man.
I would never forgive myself.
Why? Because he's decent and honest and fair?
No, because I know you.
You'd go mad.
And besides that, he's a big flannel-mouthed bore.
If you want to punish me, go ahead.
Cut off one of my fingers. Go on, pick one.
If it was your tongue, I might be tempted!
All right. We will have it your way.
I'm leaving.
And I wpll not be back!
There are other young ladies in Paris as attractive and charming as you are and a damn sight more sincere!
- Sincere?
- Sincere.
Sincere! I'm surprised that word doesn't turn to stone in your mouth.
What are we fighting about?
You know I'm crazy about you.
- Not enough to marry me, you're not.
- What's marriage got to do with it?!
I understand marriage has something to do with love.
When a man loves a woman he's willing to give her his name.
Names! Names don't mean anything.
The widest woman I ever met was named Prudence.
And why do they call all the crooks Honest John?
I even knew a girl who called herself Virginia.
For heaven sakes, go away.
All right, Simone. I will leave.
And this is permanent.
Nothing is ever permanent with you.
You're too selfish.
Francois!
- What is it?
- Oh, la-la. What are you mad at?
Not you, sweetheart.
Ah.
- Mind if I have a drink?
- Pull up a chair.
I'm lonesome.
Oh, no, none of that. I will take Cognac.
You're too cute a girl to be spending a lonesome afternoon.
Francois. You always say something nice, but you never do anything about it.
What are you thinking?
What a rainy day it is.
- Rainy? Oh, but it's a beautiful day.
- That's what I said.
You know, Francois,
I could be very helpful in a crisis.
I believe you could.
But I'm sorry, sweetheart.
# It's the wrong time

PhiIipe. Ha-ha!
Do you know what you said to the prosecuting attorney when he asked for a writ of certiorari?
You said, ''Yes, dear.''
''Yes, dear''! To the prosecuting attorney!
That's Montmartre over there, on the hiII.
I know. I know where Montmartre is.
I know it as well as anyone in Paris.
LoveIy sight.
Do you always throw your pen out of the window?
That was my cigarette.
Philippe.
Philippe, who is she?
I know, I know.
Ooh-la-la-la, c'est magnifique!
- You don't mean Simone Pistache?
- I do. I do.
Simone's going to marry me.
- Marry you?
- Yes. Yes, me.
Not your friend Francois Durnais. Me.
Oh...
But you cannot marry her.
Amplify that statement, wpll you?
Better still, I will condense it: goodbye, career.
Marry a cabaret entertainer and the city council wpll forget your name.
- The councilmen aren't all snobs.
- Their wives are.
What about Councilman Lagouche?
His wife used to be the biggest...
But Lagouche was elected, not appointed like you.
- If I have to, I will get elected.
- Philippe, you have background, ability.
I just can't sit back and watch you throw your future out of the window like your pen!
PauI, Paul, you've forgotten your own philosophy.
# Live, and let live
Yes, but think, my boy, think.
Take care! Take care!
# Drink, and let drink
# Dance, and let dance
Yes, but not with Simone.
- I think she's right for me.
- I do not.
# So what, so what, so what?
- # PIay, and let play
- With your own set.
- # Sing, and let sing
- You've got me upset.
- # Shout, and let shout
- You're going mad.
- # No, glad! I'm so glad!
- This is bad.
# I hate to mention it, Your Honour, but remember this line:
- # Your business...
- # But such business!
# And my business is mine
# Your business is your business
# And my business is mine
Good evening, sir.
Good evening.
I was told I might find Monsieur Durnais here.
Monsieur Durnais is right there, sir.
500 francs. Pay me.
- Take it. I wold not have done that for 5,000.
- You have no faith in your fellow men.
- Francois.
- Ah, Paul.
Sit down, sit down.
Did you catch my act?
- You must be starved for diversion.
- Well, I concede I'm a bit moody.
Francois, I have to talk to you.
What are you going to do about your friend Simone and Philippe Forrestier?
Nothing. Not a thing.
How can I compete with a man who's willing to get married?
It's like playing cards with a cheat.
- There are ways to outwit a cheat.
- Like what, Paul?
You tell me, Francois.
You're the schemer.
I've thought about murder, suicide, chronic alcoholism, but none of those things satisfy me.
No other schemes?
Yes, one more. Forget she ever existed.
Ah, no. No, no, no, no.
That's called giving up, and you love her too much for that.
There must be some way to prevent this impossible marriage...
Paul...
- An inspiration?
- Mm...
Would you give them an engagement party and invite all of the social bigwigs in Paris?
But Francois, I'm against this marriage.
So am I, Paul. So am I.
- Oh, Philippe, I don't know.
- Don't be nervous. They're just people.
I've never had stage fright before.
It's such a distinguished party, isn't it?
So distinguished, it might be difficult to keep awake.
- Good evening, my dear.
- Oh, gracious host!
So gratified, I assure you.
- How are you, Philippe?
- Fine, fine.
- This is a marvellous idea for a party.
- It is, isn't it?
My dear Philippe! I am so happy for you.
- Is this your enchanting fiancee?
- Yes.
The Duchess de Grimont, may I introduce Miss Pistache.
Nice.
So gratified to encounter you,
Your Grace, I assure you.
Particularity on such a distinguished boat.
Witty, too. May I borrow your fiance for a moment?
There's a lady here who thought she was going to get him. I want to depress her.
A little later?
I'd rather not leave Simone.
Oh, no, Philippe, please.
You mustn't refuse her graciousness.
Run along, run along. I will just stand here with
Paul and enjoy the distinguished gathering.
I will be back.
- May I get you a glass of champagne?
- Oh, I'd be so gratified, I assure you.
- Simone. How are you, sweetheart?
- I will find a waiter.
And what are you doing here?
Celebrating your betrothal, just like everyone else is.
I do not wish to seem unfriendly in my great hour of happiness, but get out of here, you louse!
Sweetheart, you're a little nervous.
Calm down.
I know I'm nervous, Francois.
You're not helping things any.
Champagne?
Here, try this - this might.
Thank you.
I will take these.
The days are getting shorter.
A little tense out, isn't it?
- Francois, I'm really terrified.
- I know. Try another one of these.
- But I just had one.
- Trust me. Drink it.
The secret of these grand parties is to be natural - helps you relax.
A few more of these and you will get a feeling you're in your own cafe.
Ready, darling?
- Well, good evening.
- Congratulations. You're a very lucky man.
Very nice of you to say so.
Will you forgive us?
Pardon me.
De Musset, perhaps, or Verlaine.
But Baudelaire, he is no poet.
''Desire, that guttering candle under the rump of night'' - it's so effortful.
- Which poet do you prefer, Miss Pistache?
- Me? Uh, the first one. He's my favourite.
I agree. Which work?
Work?
Oh, I just remembered, I've left my hankie.
I will be right back.
- Anything wrong?
- Oh...
You're jumpy.
- Francois, I'm desperate.
- What's the matter?
I don't know. I can't seem to talk to those people in there. De Musset and Ver...
- Verlaine?
- Verlaine.
I never heard of those names.
They must think I'm just a terrible dummy.
That's because you're trying to be something you're not.
- I am a dummy.
- Have a little more wine, dummy.
I've never had so much to drink in my life.
I don't even feel it.
You know, these people are crazy about entertainers.
They really like performers, really they do.
I was just thinking, remember the routine you made up at Yvette's birthday party?
- It was great. Just great.
- Yvette's birthday party.
- That was a wonderful party.
- Remember the routine?
That routine...
I don't think for these people, Francois.
- Why not?
- Well... Not for these people.
Would I steer you wrong? Let me tell you something: I know these people.
They're probably so bored that they would love to be entertained.
You'd have them in the palm of your hand.
You'd own them all.
Oh, Francois... Really?
- You scared?
- Scared?
Have some more courage.
Well...
Ladies and gentlemen... If you please, may I have your attention?
It is my pleasure to introduce to you the guest of honour, Mademoiselle Pistache.
Judge Forrestier's fiancee would like now to entertain you with a number that
I don't believe you've ever seen.
If you wpll just be seated and make a little more room, she's ready to entertain you.
Mademoiselle Pistache.
# From down to up
# About this town
# I've drunk my cup
# From up to down
# But being a connoisseur
# And a great social pet
# The circle which I prefer
# Is the dilettante set
# If you want to pass through the gilded gates
# Where the bourgeois meet the sophisticates
# To exchange their views and to compare their mates
# Come along with me
# If you'd like to dine with an old marquis
# Who wpll swear that technically he is free
# But his wife's the only technicality
# Come along with me
# Come along with me, my pretty
# Let me open your eyes
# In this great big wicked city
# It is folly not to be wise
# And if any night, baby, you would care
# For an unconventional love affair
# I will improve your mind if you will let down your hair
# Come along, come along
# Come along with me
# There's a prince whose home has become a must
# For the lower men of the upper crust
# Cos his high-born wife has such a low-cut bust
# Come along with me
# There's a king who's on the town, dear
# Who imbibes round the clock
# He wpll show you his gold crown, dear
# When he gets his crown out of hock
Whee!
Whee!
# Come along
# Come along
# Come along with me!
Simone.
Simone, please, don't be upset.
Simone.
I will kill him, Philippe.
The minute I see that Francois I will kill him.
And I will go to the guillotine a happy woman.
But, Simone, you'd be leaving a very unhappy man.
Philippe, you mustn't even talk to me.
I don't deserve to be talked to.
Oh, Philippe, I disgusted your friends.
Oh, they were absolutely disgusted.
Who cares. They disgust me.
I will break his head open.
Simone, nothing has happened that matters the least bit.
Oh, but Philippe, I humiliated you right in front of your friends.
I showed them what a stupid, cheap girl you want to marry.
No one's allowed to criticise
Madame Forrestier, not even you.
But I did. I humiliated you right in front of your friends.
Philippe, I don't belong with those people.
I took this distinguished boat and I turned it into a cheap, low-class saloon.
''Distinguished boat.''
That's the most lovable phrase I ever heard.
I will kill Francois!
Simone, look at me. Look at me.
Let's do something better than killing Francois.
Let's show him how little he means.
We will walk back to the salon and let everyone see how unimportant their opinions are to us.
I can't go back there again!
I'd never go back there.
Just smile at them, Simone, just smile, and in 20 minutes they will be drinking toasts to you, believe me.
Just believe me.
I will fix my face, then.
That's my girl.
Come.
All right.
You wait outside.
I will be out in a little while.
Good.
I'm proud of you.
Simone? Simone?
- Coffee?
- No.
Cognac?
She hasn't been to her home, no one's heard from her since the party.
She may be dead, Paul!
She might have drowned!
Don't be dramatic. She feels ashamed and doesn't want to see people, that's all.
That doesn't explain her hiding from me.
A man to see you.
He says he's Andre, the head waiter.
- Andre? Well, send him in.
- Come in, Andre.
Good evening, monsieur. Mademoiselle
Pistache asked me to deliver this personally.
Andre, where is she? Is she all right?
She is quite all right, sir.
This goes with the letter, sir.
Andre, wait.
- Where is Miss Pistache? Please.
- I am not allowed to tell, sir. I'm sorry.
Well, what does it say?
You can read faster than that.
''I know you can make Philippe understand.''
''Please tell him I'm still not a liar,
I'm not cheap and I'm not a thief, but I'd be all three if I married him now that
I know what a mistake it would be. Simone.''
''PS. This is the first piece ofjewellery
I ever returned to a man.''
That girl has style.
I don't call that style. You don't break up because some stuffed shirts snub you - not unless you're as big a snob as they are.
Oh, it's over.
Don't go on torturing yourself.
I don't know how to stop.
You're not the first to have that problem.
# As Madame du Barry once said to her boyfriend, ''Fare thee well''
# As Columbus announced when he knew he was bounced:
# ''It was swell, Isabelle, swell''
# As Abelard said to HeIo:i:se:
# ''Don't forget to drop a line to me, please''
# As Juliet cried in her Romeo's ear:
# ''Romeo, why not face the fact, my dear?''
# ''It was just one of those things''
# Just one of those crazy filings
# One of those bells that now and then rings
# Just one of those things
# It was just one of those nights
# Just one of those fabulous flights
# A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
# Just one of those things
# If you'd thought a bit of the end of it
# When you started painting the town
# You'd have been aware that your love affair
# Was too hot not to cool down
# Say, ''Goodbye, dear, amen''
# Here's hoping you will meet her again
# It was great fun
# But it was just one of those things
# Just one of those things
# Poof!
The plaintiff alleges that...
Durnais speaking. Hello?
Oh, Claudine.
Simone what?
Well, you needn't yell.
Simone is on her way to see you.
I don't like to gossip, but I think she's going to shoot you.
- What gave you that idea?
- She did. She said so to Arturo.
I thought you might be interested.
Thank you, Claudine. I am, in a way.
Yes, thank you very much.
Any time, cheri.
Uh, yes.
I'm not in to Miss Pistache.
In fact, I'm out of the country.
Now, you go out and protect you job.
Dead men pay no Christmas bonuses.
- She's coming in now.
- Has she got a gun?
Well, maybe. She's carrying a box.
Go, go, go.
Good morning.
I would like to see Monsieur Durnais.
It's important.
- He's not in.
- I will wait.
- But he won't be back for a long time.
- I'm in no hurry.
He's out of the country.
I don't believe you.
- Go ahead, shoot.
- Oh, Francois.
I wold not want to hurt my best friend.
Well, a little bird told me that you came over here with homicide on your mind.
I will admit at first I wanted to hack off your head, but after a while I...
- Well, I think it was all for the best.
- Oh.
Well, what about Philippe?
I haven't seen him.
We're no longer engaged.
- Well, congratulations are in order!
- Don't.
We should be celebrating our getting together again. This is a big moment, honey-face.
Don't, Francois.
- I've decided to do without men for a while.
- You've decided to...
Oh, that's not my little birdie taking.
- I didn't say forever.
- Well, then I will be patient.
I'm concentrating on one thing - making money.
Thank heaven.
I thought perhaps you might have changed.
The Quat'z'Arts Ball committee called the other day.
They say if I can handle it, they will let me give the ball this year.
Say! That's a big coup.
I could make a small fortune, if you'd help me.
- How much?
- 15,000 francs.
You got it.
All right, but I don't want any favours.
Only a business deal.
What are you making a fuss for?
Just take the money.
No, a strict business deal.
This is the deed to my cafe - security for the loan.
Why bother with...
If you don't want to do it my way, we will just have to forget it.
OK, we will do it your way.
Now, if you will sign right there, you will hold the title untiI I can pay back the money.
- My name is already there.
- Mm-hm.
You know, since you've been going around with that judge, you sure got pretty legal.
I will give this back to you as soon as I have the change of title recorded.
Anything you say, sweetheart.
- There you are.
- Thank you so much.
Good day, Francois.
I just wanted to tell you
I'm sorry if you've been unhappy.
Good.
Frankly, I want you to be sorry.
Bye-bye.
Ladies and gentlemen of the four arts, we would like now to present for your entertainment a ballet based on the story of Adam and Eve.
''Why Adam and Eve?'' you may ask.
Well, we chose Adam and Eve because we would like to remind the police department that sin was not invented in Montmartre, it was only perfected here.
Splendid, Andre.
Aaarh!
Aaarh!
Hey.
How's my little French pastry?
- What do you say? This the night?
- Philippe...
Biggest bottle I could find, sweetheart.
Bring another glass, huh?
- Philippe, please go away.
- Hey, wait.
I brought you a cat. Her name's the Duchess de Grimont. Like cats?
She's very cute, but please...
Better like this cat.
She's got a diamond necklace.
Oh. It's very pretty.
Hey, you too can be an animal lover.
Just takes a little coaxing, huh, first prize?
- What do you say?
- Goodness, I've never seen you drunk before.
- I'm not drunk.
- Well, you're not yourself.
Why should I be myself?
You don't like myself.
You like flip, sophisticated fellows with a lot of fast answers.
You like men who know how to make you laugh, and then treat you badly.
Well, that isn't so hard to learn.
Now crawl out of that skin, wpll you?
We're going to thrill the tourists at Maxim's.
Forget about this ball here - it's rolling.
What you laughing at, French pastry?
You sound just like him. You're funny.
- What's the matter?
- The cat! She's scampered for the pawn shop.
Hey, cat! Fat cat!
Where are ya? Fat cat with the loot!
Ah, there you are, there you are!
Little baby.
Keep a firm grip on this beast.
It has a message for you, sweetheart.
Oh, my!
- Do you know what you just did?
- Sure. Closed the stupid window.
I think maybe I was wrong about you.
No argument, birdie.
Oh, I mean you and me.
It might not be such a bad mistake after all.
Don't... don't rush me, birdie.
I mean, if I really make you happy, then I wold not be wrong for you, would I?
Yes, sweetheart, you would.
According to the people that count, you sure would.
But who cares!
# It's the wrong time
# And the wrong place
# Though your face is charming
# It's the wrong face
# But it's your face
# And such a charming face
# That if you might... agree
# Dear, it's all right
# Yes, it's all right
# With me
Ring-a-ding-ding-ding.
Let's get out of here, honey.
All right, Philippe.
I have something to attend to first, though.
I will be haIf an hour.
I will meet you at Maxim's.
You can bet on it, birdie.
Hey, Eve, about that apple...
Francois. I hope you're having a pleasant evening.
- You do?
- Well, not really.
He may be long on law, but he sure is short on charm.
Hey, who closed this window?
Philippe.
Philippe, huh?
- Now I'm worried.
- You have reason to be worried.
Look, I'm getting tired of that cold-shoulder treatment and I decided to take steps.
Now step number one...
Darling, it's the mate to the other one.
Oh, my, Francois! Isn't that loveIy!
- Oh, thank you!
- I knew you'd like it.
That's loveIy. You're going to be arrested.
- Isn't that pretty?
- I love it. Thank you.
I'm going to be what?
Arrested. In 30 seconds.
I've made all the arrangements.
Oh, you poor girl, your mind's crumbing.
It's the strain of keeping away from me.
- Remember that deed you signed?
- Yes. What about it?
Well, when you signed that deed you became the proprietor of this establishment.
Now, when I go out and tell Arturo to start the cancan, this place wpll be raided.
I know because I fixed it with the police.
Now, the police usually arrest the proprietor.
And you, dear sweet darling Francois, are the proprietor.
You wold not do a thing like that.
No, not for about another ten seconds.
Look, this is not just a weekend in jail or a fine. I could be disbarred.
Ha! I know. Excuse me.
Wait a minute. I know I've been a little rough on you - cos I didn't want to lose you.
That's where we differ.
I do want to lose you.
Wait a minute!
You're not giving any signals tonight!
The hell I'm not!
Simone!
Simone! Simone!
Help.
Call the first case.
The City of Paris versus Francois Durnais.
Monsieur Durnais.
May it please the court,
I ask permission to act as my own attorney.
May I remind you, Monsieur Durnais, that an attorney who represents himself is said to have a fool for a client.
Thank you, Your Honour, but I still believe that it is better than having a fool for a lawyer.
No objection.
Your Honour, Monsieur Paul Barriere, the eminent president of the court, has abstained from sitting today so that he might give testimony as a character witness.
I call Monsieur Barriere to the stand.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Monsieur, wpll you tell the court what you know of the character of the defendant?
Monsieur le President, Your Honours,
I have known the defendant for many years.
He is an excellent lawyer, a credit to his profession, and a good good friend.
Whether or not he's guilty technically,
I ask the court to bear in mind that a sentence of guilty would automatically result in his professional ruin.
And I do not think the city of Paris is so rich in legal talent that it can so casually lose the services of a gifted and honourable attorney.
Thank you.
The court is grateful to have Judge Barriere's opinion.
And the defendant thanks you, Your Honour.
I would like to call
Mademoiselle Pistache to the stand.
Mademoiselle Pistache.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
I do.
- Your name?
- Simone.
- You have a last name?
- Of course. You know I have a last name.
May the court hear it?
Simone Pistache.
Are you the Simone Pistache who owns the Bal du Paradis?
No, I'm not.
Oh, that is a different Simone Pistache?
If there's another Simone Pistache,
I don't know her. I don't see...
If my questions confuse you...
I am not confused!
You haven't asked me anything intelligent.
I wpll begin again.
Which Simone Pistache do you state you now are?
The one who, until four days ago, owned the Bal du Paradis, at which time it was taken over by another party.
- ''Taken over''? You mean bought?
- No.
Oh, you gave it away as a gift?
No.
- Well, perhaps you put it up as collateral?
- What does that mean?
It means a pledged of payment.
Oh.
Let us say that you needed a great deal of money desperately.
And let us say there was a young man who loved you very much.
And this young man was eager to lend you the money for no more collateral than a smile.
But you said, ''No, monsieur, I refuse.
You must accept the cafe as security.''
And this young man, rendered witless by his affections for you, accepted your terms.
Monsieur Durnais, your supposition is not a question.
It isn't a supposition either.
The court is not interested in why you own the cafe.
It merely wants to learn whether or not you do.
Miss Pistache, if there is a deed giving title to Monsieur Durnais, may the court see it?
Oh, the deed...
You have such a deed?
The deed... Um...
Do you have the deed?
- No.
- What?
No. I lost it.
- When did this happen?
- Just now.
I just remembered, I lost it on my way running to catch a carriage.
I move that the case against Francois Durnais be...
Just a moment.
Miss Pistache, is there a chance of your finding the lost document?
Uh...
No, Your Honour. No. Once I make up my mind to lose something, I never find it.
You haven't forgotten that you're under oath?
I always tell the truth, Your Honour.
Well, except...
Except?
Well, sometimes it takes a little while to learn what the truth is.
I see.
That is all.
I move that the case against Francois Durnais be dismissed due to lack of evidence.
Motion granted. Case dismissed.
- Your Honour!
- Yes, madame?
The fact remains that this vile dance was performed at the Bal du Paradis, and whoever is guilty must be punished!
- May I intervene, Your Honour?
- By all means.
Madame, have you ever seen the cancan?
Why, certainly not!
Well, then may I suggest that the court adjourn to the Bal du Paradis this evening and take an official look at... at the crime?
An excellent suggestion.
Court is adjourned.
Yiii-ha!
Aaarhh!
Well, what's the verdict?
- Are you offended in any way?
- Do you still want to ban it?
Ban it?
- I want to learn it!
- I will teach you!
- A toast to Madame la President!
- Madame la President!
Merci, merci.
Pardon me. I will be right back.
Yes?
Mademoiselle, wpll you please step outside for a moment?
What for?
It wpll save embarrassment.
All right. But no free drinks - that performance was legal.
Thank you.
Now, what is it?
Mademoiselle, we have a warrant for your arrest.
- Arrest?!
- Come along.
Wait a minute!
I told you, it was legal tonight!
- Andre! Andre!
- Get in there.
Andre, I want Francois!
This service quick enough for you?
They get you too? What's the charge?
It will cost me about 2,000, including this wagon.
- What wpll?
- For rigging a false arrest.
I will smash you, Francois!
- One of these days I will smash you!
- Simone... Stop screaming at me.
Now listen to me.
You were in a lot of trouble a second ago and you called for me, didn't you?
Now, I love you, Simone. I truly love you.
Now please forgive me.
- Oh, you don't love me!
- I'm willing to make it legal.
You don't love me now, you never have loved me, and you're going to go on like...
You what?
Francois, honesty?
You mean you want to marry me?
No, I thought I'd just adopt you.
You miserable...

No such thing!

I don't see no good reason why we should get all head up...

Rose, stop squirming!
And we'll never see again.
How can i... you look lovely, dear.
I'll take that brush.
Try to stay clean.
Here, let me help ya.
I can't do one of these.
When I was your age,
I could tie 'em.
[ Katie ]
Just fine.
And you look gorgeous.
Now please, try to remain clean.
How about this one?
[ Alice ]
Do you like it better than the green one?
Oh, yes, dear!
It's just fine.
I always did love that dress.
I didn't see nothin' wrong with the white one you had on in the first place.
Oh, grandpa, do you really like that one better than this one?
I mean, do you think it looks better on me?
Honey, you'll have 'im bug-eyed and breathless no matter what dress you're wearin'.
I just didn't want to see her get her heart broke.
But anybody that twists the truth around the way he does in his newspaper...
I sure wouldn't believe nothin' he wrote in the letter.
[ Girl ]
Here he comes!
He's turning at the gate!
[ Children gasping ]
[ Children clamoring ]
Look it!
[ Indistinct talking ]
Get away!
Get away from the window!
Come on!
Oh, look it!
- Girls, get away from that window.
- [ Groaning ] Do we have to?
Calvin, please.
What's he like?
He doesn't look much like his picture.
He's grown a moustache!
Oh!
[ Door closes ]
[ Children oohing ]
Grandpa, he'll see you!
Say, look at 'im.
He sure thinks he is somebody.
Got a big, gold watch chain.
Got to show how important he is.
Boys.
He don't look like he's got sense enough to pound sand in a rat hole.
You can sort of tell by looking at him.
He's just the type that would put out a republican newspaper.
[ Children protesting ]
[ Doorbell rings ]
[ Clearing throat ]
How do you do?
I'm Alice.
- Uh, won't you come in?
- Thank you.
[ Door slams ]
Uh, may I take your hat?
Well, at least it's turned out to be a pleasant day after the rain.
[ Sighs ]
I hope you had a nice trip.
Yes, quite nice.
I-I don't... I don't think
I would have recognized you...
If we'd met on the street.
It's probably your moustache.
It...
Well, it-it makes you look so different.
Oh?
Um, would you have recognized me?
Well, I, uh...
I don't quite recall...
Well, from my picture, I mean.
Oh.
[ Laughs ]
Well, I-i know it wasn't too good of me.
[ Laughs ]
Well, there've been so many things lately...
And I-i guess I don't have the best memory in the world.
[ Laughing ]
[ Laughing ]
My wife tells me what I should do...
Your wife?
Look, am I in the wrong house or something? I wanted to see a "rensselaer bower."
Now they told me...
Rensselaer?
Well, that's my grandfather.
[ Sighs ]
You mean you're not Joseph carder?
[ Laughs ]
I'm Henry white...
Of the Democratic national committee.
Oh! [ Laughs ]
Mr. bower has corresponded with postmaster Dickinson.
Something about a campaign song he's written...
And a family band he'd like to take to the convention in St. Louis.
Strange.
Grandpa? Grandpa, this man is here to see you.
[ Scoffs ]
He's from the Democratic national committee!
That must mean they're interested.
We're just as good as on the train to St. Louis.
[ Children cheering ]
It's sure nice of ya to come.
Mighty glad to see ya.
I promised postmaster Dickinson.
Well, eh, what I had in mind was the reason I writ down.
You see, I made up a campaign song for president Cleveland.
I know.
And what I thought might be a good idea...
To take the family band to St. Louis...
And sort of introduce it right there at the convention.
Put on a whole musical show if ya want.
I read the letter.
Well, first thing, of course, before ya decide, maybe you'd like to hear the song?
We do feel that a good, stirring song might inspire party workers...
To greater effort and devotion.
You sure come to the right place!
Been a lot of dirty, underhanded politics.
Republicans making a play for the undecided voters, the fence straddlers.
Trying to tell them grover
Cleveland hasn't lived up to his campaign promises.
Shh. My daughter-in-law, Katie, don't like politic talking in the house.
Out to the barn, everybody!
We're gonna play our campaign song!
[ Children cheering ]
Hurray for grandpa!

We, um...
We've quite a few Bridges to cross before then.
One thing I will say about the song though, it really gets to you.
Makes you proud to be a democrat, doesn't it?
Well, I guess it would, if I was.
He weren't never too bright, even as a boy.
Then he growed up to be a gol-darned republican.
Do you mean, you could sing that the way you did and still...
Who'd sing your part if the rest of you came to St. Louis?
Nobody's takin' off and leavin' me home, not as long as there's a place to go and a way to get there.
A republican singing at a Democratic convention.
It just didn't seem the kind of a song...
They'd appreciate at a republican convention.

Actually, to me, music stands above all this anyhow.
You don't have to be a southerner to sing,
"the yellow rose of Texas"...
Or a sailor to dance a hornpipe.

Mostly he votes for the man.

Please!

Whoa!
Alice.
I can't imagine what you must think.
Then I'll tell you what I think.
I think you must be a lot more fun than I ever realized, than I even dared to hope!
The way you were doing that, you were...
What I mean is,
I've never seen anyone clown around like that...
And look beautiful all at the same time.
You want to know something?
I-I haven't slept in a week.
J-just thinking about what
I would do, w-what I would say when we first met.
I was afraid it would all be so formal like your letters.
And I-i wouldn't know what to say, I would j-just... i wouldn't think of anything.
Or maybe I'd...
And I would just start jabbering and not have enough sense to stop.
That's silly.
Why would anybody feel like that?
[ Giggles ]
Actually, I was the one who found the name of your newspaper.
I asked Alice to send that first letter.
[ Giggles ]
Well, I must not have done a very good job, selling you on Dakota.
Well, uh, it isn't always that simple.
You see, a family the size of ours, we put down a lot of roots.
But if you could just realize the opportunities there are in Southern Dakota.
We're about to become a state, you know?
Must be beautiful in the black hills: Trees, lakes, little streams.
Oh, I'm sure it's very nice, but we have a good life here...
And a lot of wonderful friends.
Yep, guess I'll have to go along with that, but...
I always keep thinking there might be someplace out west just a little bit better.
We've been lucky every time we've moved, and a man hates to quit when he's winning.
No place ever gonna be so wonderful that you couldn't dream up something better.
But you wouldn't say that,
Mrs. bower, if you'd just seen the black hills.
The air has a snap to it!
It's the scent of the pines.
And the sky's so blue...
You almost can't believe it.
I know what would be fun!
Why don't you and papa come along to the meeting?
Hear his lecture.
Oh, and, um, grandpa, you can come too, if you'd like.
[ Katie ]
Uh, well, I-i don't really know.
I'd be very flattered if you would come.
Have you gotten many people to move to Dakota?
Well, not just people,
Mr. bower, but the right people.
You see, the thing that first interested our state chairman, he found that you're...
Almost 100 percent republican through this whole area.
Oh? That's mostly what you're interested in, ain't it?
Gettin' Republicans to move up there?
That's right, sir. You see,
Mr. bower, this past year we've had almost a tidal wave...
Of shiftless, irresponsible democrats moving in.
A bunch of shysters and quacks and usury-type moneylenders.
And if we don't do something about it soon, they'll have us outnumbered!
Well, let me tell you somethin', young man. You're trumpetin' a flat tune on a worn-out horn.
'Cause you can't turn back a tidal wave, not by puttin' out a rabble-rousin', ragtag newspaper.
And not by speech-makin' to a bunch of poor, misguided
Republicans! And furthermore...
That's enough, grandpa.
Now stop it.
We have a very special little rule that I have to invoke,
Mr. carder, to, to make life bearable around here.
We do not discuss, we do not even mention politics in this house.
And the summer kitchen,
I consider part of the house.
I'm sorry, Mrs. bower,
I didn't know.
Oh, it's all right.
Oh, it's all right.
I don't blame you.
And I certainly didn't mean to offend you, Mr. bower.
- I just naturally assumed that you were republican too.
- [ Scoffs ]
Alice never happened to mention anything to the contrary in any of her letters.
Well, now that's all settled.
We'd be very happy to attend your meeting, Mr. carder, if you really want us there.
Come, Alice. Let's give
Mr. carder a nice piece of chocolate cake.
And another consideration.
There's enough land in Dakota so that each of your sons, as he comes of age, can take up a homestead, start out in life owning a good piece of land, instead of working all his life trying to get it, trying to pay off a mortgage.
Now, let me tell you something, truthfully.
You're the kind of people we need in Dakota.
Solid, decent, hard-working people, who will help to build, who'll always belong.
Who'll share in the golden future of a glorious land!
[ Crowd murmuring ]
Up in my neck of the woods, in the black hills,
you'll find rivers, lakes and babbling streams.
And that's sweet music, my friends.
Sweet music when you're reading about another drought spreading across the plains.
Now that's why this whole westering movement...
Appeals to thoughtful, far-seeing men, who want a better life for their families.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
[ Man ]
What are we waitin' for?
I'm gonna go home and start packing!
[ Murmuring gets louder ]
Don't forget to take along your snake-bite remedy!
- Do ya have snakes in Dakota?
- No more than most places.
And your frostbite remedy too. Ya might need that even worse!
How cold does it get in the winter?
That depends. We're a very large territory.
Ain't nobody really knows.
Thermometers always freeze up and bust!
[ Laughing ]
[ Crowd murmuring ]
I remind you, all of you, that Mr. carder is here as an invited guest!
And we're gonna listen to him tell us about
Dakota in his own way.
Without interruption!
[ Crowd cheers, applauds ]
I'd be glad to tell you some more about Dakota...

I'll race you back!
Okay!
[ Children laughing ]
[ Katie ]
The first thing we do, we'll make a list of all the things we want to take with us.
Then try and sell off everything else.
[ Calvin ] We can't do it.
Can't do it?
Not this year.
Maybe later on if things work out.
[ Katie ]
But now, Calvin, you know very well that the very best land...
Will go to the first homesteaders that get there.
Yeah, that sounds logical.
And if we wait a whole year, all the good land will be gone.
[ Calvin ]
You've got to remember all the plotting and planning...
And scheming that went into it, to make this St. Louis trip possible.
We can't give it up now.
Well, we're not going to St. Louis...
Just so the children can get a ride on a train.
It's not the children
I'm thinking about.
They've got their whole lives ahead of 'em.
But what about grandpa?
When's he ever gonna get another chance like this?
We're not gonna have him with us forever, you know?
[ Katie ]
Yes, I know.
[ Calvin ] don't you worry.
We'll work it out.
I think we'd be a lot better off, all of us, movin' to rapid city, like your papa wanted to all along.
[ Groaning ]
What fun's a little old mud-street town like rapid city?
And ridin' on a wagon and gettin' a side ache instead of...
I wanna ride on a train!
I want to ride on a train too!
We want to go to St. Louis!
Shh, shh, shh!
Now, will you let me say what I'm gonna say?
I'll talk to Alice.
She'll be disappointed, but she'll understand.
I wish I'd thought ahead a little bit before talking to Sidney...
About him taking up his own homestead, later on.
It might be still possible that we get there next year.
Just suppose we don't get the best...

[ Crowd cheering, applauding ]
Now we met and we surpassed every requirement...
Congress could set forth.
[ Crowd ]
Right!
But do they Grant us statehood?
[ Crowd ]
No.
Do they take us into the union?
[ Crowd ]
No!
Do they live up to their end of the bargain?
[ Crowd ] No!
And why not?
Why not, I ask you?
What's wrong with us?
- Maybe you talk too much!
- [ Crowd jeering ]
Well, then they'd better get used to it...
Right!
'Cause there are a lot of things that need to be said.
[ Crowd agreeing ]
I'll tell you what the trouble really is.
They're afraid of us.
Who's afraid of you?
Because they know that when north and south Dakota become states, and we send our senators back to Washington, we're gonna send Republicans, right?
- [ Booing ]
- Sit down, you silly republican!
Why don't you be quiet, you dumb democrat?
And that just might break the stranglehold...
That grover Cleveland and his
Democratic congress have held upon this great country of ours.
That Joe gets himself wound up, don't he?
Yeah!
[ Laughing ]
[ Joe ] We'll declare ourselves the free and sovereign states of north and south Dakota!
[ Crowd cheering ]
One thing, they got a pretty good crowd out to cheer us across the finish line.
Really, grandpa?
Why do you always have to spoil a good story...
By asking,
"really, grandpa?"
[ Laughing ]
[ Crowd cheering ]
Isn't that Joe carder?
Right? We're free men.
We're free men.
We'll hold our own elections!
[ Crowd agreeing ]
We'll draw up a constitution for the sovereign states of north and south Dakota!
[ Crowd cheering ]
Now, grandpa, you're not gonna get into a political squabble...
Before we even got our feet on the ground.
You know what they're trying to do? They're trying to divide Dakota into two states!
The only reason's so they can send four republican senators back to Washington...
Instead of just the two they're supposed to have!
Now, take it easy.
Hey, Mr. carder!
We made it!
[ Children ]
Hello, Mr. carder!
- Another good republican family come to join us.
- [ Crowd booing, cheering ]
[ Crowd murmuring ]
Oh. Oh.
Why, thank you, sir.
Ah, Ernie stubbins at your service.
Alice.
Oh!
[ Giggles ]
You made it.
Good.
Oh, how are you?
Alice, uh, this is Ernie stubbins, one of our local... yeah.
We already swapped names and done our howdies.
Alice, uh, Mr. wrenn, the president of the school board.
I told Mr. wrenn that you might be interested in a teaching position.
Miss bower, it's a pleasure.
If you'll come this way, my dear,
I'll see that you're signed up.
Oh, well, we just got here...
And I haven't even, uh...
Miss bower, our school is closed for lack of a teacher. We can't afford to waste another day.
Oh, excuse me, Mr. wrenn.
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Calvin bower.
How do you do?
[ Both ]
How do you do?
Mr. wrenn is president of the school board.
Oh, and their family.
[ Children ]
Hello, Mr. wrenn.
I've located a house for you, Mr. bower.
Good.
It's out on rapid creek.
It's not new, but it's big.
So, I guess you'd better get signed up here in town.
Save a trip back, huh?
This won't take long. Then
I must get word to the children that school opens tomorrow.
[ Children groan ]
Would you wait just a minute,
Mr. wrenn? I'll be right back.
♪ [ Banjo ]
Frank?
Yeah? Yeah?
Carry on for a few minutes, will you please? I'll be right back.
Who, me? All right.
All right, all you children wait here with grandpa.
[ Children ] All right.
But let's just look at the national situation and consider where we're drifting...
If something isn't done to clear up the mess in Washington.
[ Crowd ]
What mess?
What are ya talkin' about?
Let me ask you.
Let me ask you.
What has grover Cleveland ever done to reduce the federal surplus?
[ Crowd ] Yeah!
[ Frank ]
He just goes on...
Collecting his tariff and piling more and more dollars into the treasury.
[ Crowd ]
That's right!
[ Frank ]
Think what it will be like in another 50 or 75 years.
Right. Every dollar in the United States piled up in Washington!
[ Crowd yelling ]
We're gonna have the richest government...
And the poorest people in the history of the world!
[ Crowd agreeing ]
We've got to remember to send men back to Washington...
Who aren't too tightfisted to spend a dollar now and then. Right?

This is all just kind of in fun.
[ Crowd disagreeing ]
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Look, this is a real fine, talented family:
The bowers.
[ Crowd clamoring ]
Now wait!
They've had a long trip.
And, as I've told you before, they're gonna be settling down here.
- Gonna be our neighbors.
- That's a mighty odd sense of humor!
Come to a statehood rally in Dakota and sing about grover Cleveland!
[ Clamoring ]
You own the streets here, do ya?
Keep 'em reserved just for speeches by Republicans?
[ Crowd laughing ]
I kind of thought this was a free country!
[ Crowd agreeing ]
Yeah, that's a good one.
"I thought this was a free country."
That's a good way to put it!
[ Crowd clamoring ]
- All right, grandpa. don't you think you've said enough?
- No, not nearly enough!
I'm gonna find out if we're still in the United States of America, or if we made a wrong turn back there somewhere!
[ Man ] You should have turned.
Now turn around and go back home!
We don't want ya here!
It isn't going to do any harm if they sing a little song about grover Cleveland.
[ Crowd disagreeing ]
Do you think that's all it would take to get him reelected?
[ Crowd ]
No!
Let me tell you somethin'!
Grover Cleveland's gonna be reelected by the biggest landslide in history!
[ Crowd scoffing, cheering ]
Well, that's what makes horse races.
Well, I'll bet ya!
I'll bet ya!
[ Crowd clamoring ]
I'm not a bettin' man.
Aw, come on!
Come on!
Wait a minute.
In the newspaper business, you can't afford to be.
- Wound up, I'll tell ya that.
- All right,
I'll tell ya what I'll do.
I'll give you a free ride down this here street in a wheelbarrow...
If Benjamin Harrison wins.
[ Crowd laughing ]
[ Crowd clamoring ]
That's right.
But now, listen, listen!
But you give me a ride if grover Cleveland wins!
- [ Crowd laughing ]
- You can afford that, can't ya?
[ Crowd ]
Come on, carder!
Come on, Joe!
All right, Mr. bower!
I'll take ya up on that!
[ Crowd cheering ]
Oh, mama,
I feel terrible not helping you with all these things.
It's just so hard to get ready.
Don't worry about me, dear.
I'm getting along just fine.
Grandpa's using your dresser mirror to shave.
[ Children talking ]
I hope we make a lot of friends.
Me too.
You're just starting to put on your hat?
Why don't all of you go on ahead?
Don't worry about me.
I'll be there.
Yes, Alice, dear,
I think that's a very good idea.
Come on, children, now.
Off to school. Come on now.
Good-bye, mama.
Got your lunch?
Got your handkerchief?
Bye, mama.
Good-bye. Oh, Quinn, do stop eating.
Bye, mama.
Good-bye, darling.
Bye.
Good-bye. Now, mind your manners. Bye.
[ Children laughing ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Sighs ]
Say, I'm all done with that mirror now, if you want it.
No, grandpa.
This is all right.
It's fine.
Say, this thing Joe carder's talkin' about yesterday, that they gonna set up their own state government...
If the president and the congress don't do it for 'em.
Grandpa, please, not now.
Now, you best listen 'cause something's being started...
That could hurt a lot of people.
A person, place or thing:
Boy, dog, St. Louis, chair.
Anytime men think they're gonna turn agin the president...
And the congress, take the law into their own hands...
A pronoun replaces a noun:
And set up their own government, he, him, she, it, they, us.
Then there's gonna be trouble.
A verb is a word that denotes action or state of being.
Grandpa, that will do!
Well, I'm just tellin' her for her own good.
Better off if she got somebody else.
Ah, say, that young cowboy that held that horse for ya yesterday.
What's his name again?
Um, Ernie stubbins?
[ Chuckles ]
You remember his name, huh?
[ Laughing ]
Sure is a handsome devil, ain't he?
Well, I don't know.
Yeah. Big he-man type.
You know, I like that.
Um, final inspection.
Oh, just lovely, dear.
Wish me luck, mama.
Oh, you'll be fine, Alice.
Grandpa, I love you.
Thank you.
If I said anything that upset ya,
I didn't mean it.
I just don't want to see ya get in over your head before ya realize it.
[ Knocking ]
Oh.
Oh, I'm glad
I caught you.
Good morning,
Mrs. bower. Mr. bower.
Alice, there's been a little problem come up.
It's a technicality, really, about your credentials.
The school board wants to meet with you and ask a few questions before you start teaching.
Before I start teaching?
Well, that's less than an hour.
[ Joe ]
You'll have to call off school, just for today.
I don't understand.
I thought everything was taken care of yesterday.
They told me that...
By now the children are probably on their way.
Mr. bower, uh, you know where the schoolhouse is, don't you?
Say, this thing you were talking about yesterday...
About how you were going to set up your own state government... grandpa, same rules as before.
There'll be no discussing politics in this house either.
Do you think you could go to the schoolhouse and send the children home?
Tell them there won't be any school today after all.
Do I think...
Thank you, sir.
Ah...
I'll bring her back, Mrs. bower.
And it's nothing to be concerned about, just a technicality.
All right.
Whoa. Whoa.
I just want to show you the place I wrote you about.
Remember?
But I don't think we should if the school board is waiting.
Alice, there are a couple of ladies on that school board...
That wouldn't get to a meeting before
It's the "what"
I'm worried about.
Look, it's nothing, believe me.
Mr. wrenn happened to hear about the ruckus in town yesterday...
When your grandfather sang his grover Cleveland song.
Oh, what's that got to do with me?
I guess he wants to talk to you.
Just to make sure that you're not inclined to stir things up.
Well, that's a very odd thing.
Maybe he wants to make sure it doesn't run in the family.
Oh?
[ Laughs ]
Come on!
[ Laughs ]
Wait.
There.
Oh, it is beautiful.
But let's come back some other time.
Why?
Well, we want to be there when the school board is ready to meet.
[ Stammering ]
Then I have to get back and help mom unpack.
Well, 'cause there are floors to be scrubbed and dishes to be washed...
And-and-and...
I want to plan more for my first day at school.

[ Giggles ]
[ Grandpa ] So, there's gonna be no school today and ya might as well all go home.
[ Children cheering ]
[ Children laughing, shouting ]
[ Laughing, shouting continues ]
What's the matter, honey?
You get hurt?
Somebody bump you?
What's your name?
Edna.
What are you crying for, edna, if you haven't been hurt?
I memorized a piece to speak...
And got dressed up...
And I slept all night...
With my hair put up in rags...
And now...
There's gonna be no school.
[ Sniffles ]
[ Chuckles ]
Why don't you speak it for me?
'Cause we ain't in school.
That's what I learned it for.
Well, now, wait a minute.
There ain't no reason why we couldn't have just a little bit of school.
But you said, "go on home."
What I meant...
I didn't mean right now.
I didn't say,
"go home right now."
I never said that.
[ Children laughing, shouting ]
Hey!
Come on back here, all of you!
Where you goin'?
Get back here!
Don't go tryin' to sneak off...
The minute my back is turned!
You told us to go.
You said there wouldn't be any school today.
Yeah!
I was just testin' you, that's all.
You gonna believe anybody that comes along, no matter what they tell you?
[ Grandpa laughing ]
You got a lot to learn, boy.
You better stay around.
[ Ringing ]
[ Ringing continues ]
[ Children chattering ]
[ Chattering continues ]
All right, sit down now.
Come on. Sit down.
Come on, get your seats.
Sit anywhere.
Hey!
Well, now, this here, as most of you know, is the first day of school.
[ Children booing ]
And, for the time bein',
I'm gonna be your teacher.
[ All ]
What?
Now, we're gonna have...
Just a few little things, and then I'll let you go home.
[ Cheering ]
Now, little edna here, she's learned a piece to speak, and she's gonna come right up in the front, and she's gonna speak it.
And you're gonna pay attention.
You don't need to wave good-bye.
We ain't goin' no place.
[ Laughing ]
I wanna ask you something.
What's your name, son?
Johnny dejohn.
- All right.
What you want to ask?
- Are you a regular teacher?
Well, no, my granddaughter Alice, she's gonna be your regular teacher.
I'm just fillin' in for the time bein'.
What I want to know...
Would you set yourself down?
Now, you go ahead, honey.
We're all listenin'.
The mountain and the squirrel had a quarrel.
The former called the latter,
"little prig."
Bun replied,
"if I am not so large as you,
"you are not so small as I.
"If I cannot carry mountains on my back, neither can you crack a nut."
Ralph Waldo Emerson.
[ Chuckling ]
Oh, that's fine!
That's fine.
[ Chuckling ]
Something bothering you, Johnny?
I was trying to find out, sir... did you graduate from the eighth grade?
Do you have a certificate to show you're a regular, qualified teacher?
Well, now,
I'll tell you this, boy.
If I know something you don't know, then I'm qualified to teach you.
Providing, of course, you got sense enough to learn.
[ Children laughing ]
Could I ask, sir, have you ever taught before?
Well, yes, you might say so.
I recollect a time there was about 50 men...
I learned them all to shoot and take care of their rifles.
I was the only teacher they had.
But in school?
That was in the army.
In the civil war!
Right there's the first thing
I'm gonna learn ya!
The proper name is
"the war between the states,"
'cause that's what it was!
[ Johnny ]
You can look in the history books.
They call it the civil war.
What about that?
Yeah!
I don't need to look in no books!
I was there,
Shiloh to appomattox, and you can take my word, there weren't nothin' civil about it!
[ Children laughing ]
That's 'cause you were a ringtail rebel!
Otherwise, you wouldn't object to it being called the civil war!
I done my fighting for the confederacy...
And general Lee, if that's what you mean.
I thought so.
I knew it from the start.
The important thing ain't what you know from the start, it's what you learn goin' along.
We should have learned one lesson from that war:
About our country staying united!
Abraham Lincoln said,
"a house divided against itself cannot stand."
[ Grandpa ]
Folks from Lincoln's own party...
Want to divide up Dakota, the north from the south.
It just don't make sense.
My father says majority rules, and they voted to make it two states.
[ Grandpa chuckling ]
You put your finger on it right there when you says...
They voted on it.
But who's gonna run this state after us old codgers is gone?
It's gonna be you young people, that's who!
But anybody ask you to vote?
[ Children shout ]
No!
[ Grandpa ] No, sir.
They try to tell you
they voted on it!
And you got no say-so!
That's your idea?
Just sit back and let them chop the wagon in two...
When you know it's gonna be you that's got to drive it?
How can we do anything about it if we're not old enough to vote?
[ Children shouting ]
Yeah!
There's always ways to do things once the body puts his mind to it.
I recollect a boy, wasn't much bigger than you are, if at all!

They say a rose that blooms in summertime...
Must die when winter comes, but the memory of its perfume lives...
Like the memory of those drums.
Well, now the war between blue and gray is fadin' in the past, but the courage of that drummer boy...
Is something that will last.
Wasn't that Johnny Shiloh?
Yeah, I guess that's what some called him after...
he was a yankee.
- He didn't fight for the confederacy.
- I never said he did.
But he was an American.
He didn't sit around and say,
"I'm only a little boy.
What can I do?"
I'll tell my pa,
"if I'm old enough to help with the milking,
I'm old enough to have some say about things!"
[ Children cheering ]
And we gotta keep talkin', talkin', talkin' like he kept drummin', drummin', drummin'!
What are you trying to do, Mr. bower?
Get Alice fired before she starts?
Oh, hold on... moving in, taking over a school.
I didn't exactly take over.
I asked you to send the children home, to tell them there wouldn't be any school today.
Now, Joe... the young'uns were already there.
Most of them was all gussied up, bein' the first day of school.
It just seemed a shame to send them home.
I don't think he meant any harm.
Right while you and I were meeting with the school board, giving our word of honor...
That nothing like this would ever happen!
It won't ever happen again.
I figured if Alice knowed enough to teach them for a whole year,
I knowed enough to teach them for one day;
Just part of a day, actually.
But that's just the point!
You didn't teach them!
Joe, please!
You got them cornered in the schoolhouse...
And then you delivered a political oration...
About not dividing Dakota, about making it one state!
It oughta be one state!
If you had a lick of brains, you'd see it for yourself!
Grandpa, that's enough!
I'm sorry, Mrs. bower.
Let's just hope none of the other students go home and start talking.
I wouldn't figure on that!
Joe! Joe.
After this, if it's anything to do with my family, just let me handle it.
[ Sighs ]
Look, it isn't just about your family.
That's a public school.
I know.
I also know that you don't know grandpa the way I do.
To you, he's probably just a cantankerous old man...
That's not the point!
He might be the sweetest man in the whole world!
But if he's gonna take over a public school, inject politics into the classroom, then...
Then it's not just a little thing that you can patch up at home.
I'll say one thing for you.
For a man that goes around preachin' treason agin our
United States government, you sure make a big fuss over a little thing like me teachin' school for a couple hours.
What do you mean
"treason," Mr. bower?
This business you keep talkin' about settin' up your own government, defying the president and the congress that's been elected by the people!
Mr. bower, I don't mind you arguing politics, so long as you don't do it in a schoolhouse.
You're entitled to your own opinion, even if it is completely ridiculous!
But when you go around, start accusing people of treason...
Joe, stop it!
Grandpa, get back in that house!
[ Joe ] I don't care if he is your grandfather, he's not gonna accuse me of treason!
It ain't just my idea.
It's in the Democratic digest!
Grandpa!
The president himself may send troops... be quiet!
I'm asking you as nicely as I know how, please leave.
Alice. Alice.
No!
[ Door slams ]
[ Whinnies ]
Best thing could have happened for Alice, break it off with a man like that.
Cause her nothing but heartache the longer she knowed him.
I... think it's time for the two of us...
To have a little talk.
In here as good a place as any.
Remember the last time
I took you to the woodshed?
When you fought that barros boy and bloodied his nose.
Never forget how you kept a'wigglin' around.
[ Chuckles ]
I had me a big old kindlin' stick, but mostly it kept a'whangin' away in the air, never connectin' with nothin'.
And all the time you was a'howlin' like a banshee.
I'm gonna tell you something.
Most of the time
I was missin' the purpose.
This isn't gonna be easy.
Just don't know how to say it.
"This is gonna hurt me more than it does you," is the customary way to start off.
Least ways, that's how
I always got into it.
You know, I had a hunch you never listened to me.
Pa...
I have tried, all the years that you've been with us, to make you feel welcome... wanted.
And you have been.
There have been times when, well, I've overlooked things that you've done...
More than I would for any other member of the family.
What kind of things?
But I won't have you making trouble for Alice and Joe.
Me cause trouble?
Joe carder's making his own trouble;
More than he realizes.
Thinks just 'cause he runs that little no-account newspaper...
I want you to promise me one thing:
That you will never again argue politics with Joe carder.
Well, now, it weren't just me.
Don't you ever say one word to him about whether Dakota should be one state or two.
Suppose he says something first?
I'm not talking about him,
I'm talking about you.
I'm talkin' about him!
What do you think I'm gonna do?
Just sit like a ninny and not say nothin' if he pops off?
I've said my say.
You've heard me.
That's the way it's gonna have to be.
Now, that's the way it ain't gonna have to be.
I'll tell you that much.
If you think I'm gonna give up my right of free speech...
That men fought and died for...
Just so Joe carder can have everything his own way...
Will you listen to me?
You think I'm gonna sit like a bump on a log...
Whilst maybe my own granddaughter is fixin' to marry some...
Benedict Arnold!
I'll tell you what I think!
If you're gonna remain here as a member of this family, then you better start to exercise a little self-control...
Just the same as everybody else!
You said that.
If'n I'm gonna stay here?
Every time i... hello, grandpa.
Hello, grandpa.
Mine is shinier than yours.
That has a little dent on it though.
[ Children continue chattering ]
Grandpa, what are you doin'?
I know when I ain't wanted.
I don't have to be hit on the head...
With a 10-foot pole.
What are you talking about,
"not wanted"?
I ain't so old or so feeble or so hard up that...
I have to stay with folks that don't want me.
Calvin, what's going on here?
I just made a very reasonable request of grandpa, no more.
Actually, a lot less than
I might make any day of any member of this family.
But i...
Excuse me, Katie.
Grandpa, please don't go.
Grandpa, you can't leave!
[ Crying ]
How can we practice or anything?
[ Children ]
Grandpa, please don't go!
You can't!
Grandpa, please.
Grandpa, please!
Grandpa, please don't go!
Please, grandpa.
Calvin, what did you do to him?
All I did... I asked him not to argue politics with Joe.
Then you better get it straightened out right now, before he gets his neck bowed any more than it is.
It took me a long time, Katie, before I finally got around to saying anything.
I don't believe
I've been unreasonable, and I'm not going to back down.
But...
I guess you know best.
[ Children pleading ]
Grandpa, please don't go!
[ Pleading continues ]
Thanks, Katie, for a lot of things.
I'll be seeing you again sometime.
Grandpa, please don't go!
Please, grandpa!
Grandpa, don't go!
Please, grandpa!
Papa, you've got to stop him.
You can't let him go.
We love you.
[ Crying ]
Please, grandpa!
Please don't go.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
[ Calvin ]
Mayo...
Come back here.
[ Crying ]
If grandpa's goin', then I'm goin' too.
[ Calvin ]
Mayo.
Did you hear me?
I wish we hadn't even heard about Dakota,
[ sobbing ]
Let alone...
Let alone comin' here.
[ Children crying ]
I don't see any reason to review what happened at the school that day.
Indeed, I think some of you parents have already heard more than you care to hear.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
I'm going to ask miss bower...
If she has any statements she would care to make.
[ Crowd chattering ]
I wish you would all understand this:
Anything my grandfather did, he did out of the goodness of his heart.
He didn't mean to do anything wrong.
[ Crowd groaning ]
[ Gavel pounding ]
You will all have your opportunity to speak.
Now, shall we behave like adults and allow miss bower to continue...
Without interruption?
[ Quiet murmuring ]
And actually,
I can't see the harm in anything my grandfather did.
He merely... miss bower, do you mean that you approve of what he did?
[ Crowd murmuring ]
I mean...
If we're going to educate the children,
I don't see why...
I can't see any harm...
In letting them hear both sides of the question.
What do you mean, "both sides"?
This question of statehood has already been settled.
[ Loud agreeing ]
We've worked hard to get it settled.
That's not what
I'm talking about.
[ Wrenn ]
Let me ask you one thing.
When your grandfather went there to the school to poison the minds...
Mr. bower's too much of a gentleman...
[ Shouting ]
[ Gavel pounding ]
Mr. wampler, sit down!
To poison the minds of the children, did he do so with your knowledge and consent?
I knew where he was going, yes,
[ crowd murmuring ]
But I don't think he poisoned any minds.
Now, wait just a minute!
Let me get one thing straight!
I was the one that sent her grandfather there...
To the schoolhouse that morning.
[ Crowd ] You were?
Not Alice.
Not miss bower.
Alice?
Joe, you promised.
I'm not gonna watch you get ripped apart...
For something that wasn't even your fault.
Don't say another word.
You just don't realize.
Your board questioned this young teacher extensively.
She assured us that nothing of thi...
[ man ]
Well, who invited him here?
What's he doing here?
[ Crowd murmuring ]
[ Man ]
Of all the nerve!
[ Murmuring continues ]
Now that Mr. bower is here,
I'd just like to ask him a couple of questions.
So would we.
Yeah, we would too.
Isn't it true,
Mr. bower... no! Stop it!
There's no need to go on with your meeting any more.
And there's no need to vote on whether or not to fire me...
Because I quit, as of right now.
[ Crowd ]
Good. That's good.
[ Joe ]
Alice, you're being foolish.
Maybe I don't know your grandfather as well as you do, but even he wouldn't want you to take the blame for something that he did.
Don't you understand anything at all?
He left because he thought we didn't want him...
I'm all for family loyalty.
I think it's a wonderful thing.
But there are limits to all things!
Including my Patience!
Now, will you just leave me alone?
Alice, will you listen?
[ Horse whinnies ]
Whoa!
[ Sighs ]
May I escort you up the street, miss bower?
Delighted, Mr. stubbins.
Until such time as we can find another teacher, meanwhile, the school will be closed.
Now, if there's no further business to be brought before the board...
I got something to say.
[ Angry murmuring ]
[ Gavel pounding ]
I will not have this meeting...
Turned into another political debate or debacle!
What I got to say,
I don't think anybody's gonna argue with.
If we was to pick out the worse thing that could possibly happen, that would be to have that school closed again...
When it just barely got open.
Yeah, that's right.
The point is...
If I'd have took time to thought about it...
I'd have realized
I was doin' wrong.
Movin' into that school that way, passin' on ideas that
I happen to believe in.
Well, I tell you, that's been one of my troubles...
All my life.
I don't generally stop and think...
'Til after it's too late.
But this time I got it all thought out ahead, and I'd like to make you just a little proposition.
What kind of a proposition?
[ Loud murmuring ]
What kind of a proposition?
Well, you get hold of Alice and talk her into takin' the job back as teacher...
And you'll keep that school open.
[ Crowd ]
That's a good idea.
That's fair.
And I give you my solemn promise,
I won't say one other word about politics...
Or whether Dakota oughta be one state or two...
Until the whole thing has been settled for good.
And then there ain't much use to say nothin' after that.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
He is absolutely right!
[ Loud chattering ]
[ Knocking ]
It ain't locked.
Just give a little push.
Just come over to tell you that both
Katie and I think...
It was a fine, generous thing you did this morning.
We were proud of you.
Goin' somewhere?
I thought maybe.
Any place special in mind?
You figure it'd be easier just to run off...
Rather than to stay here and face it day by day.
I just wonder what people...
What people might say, that's all.
You haven't forgotten that bet you made with Joe carder the first day we came to town.
Some of the boys have got a wheelbarrow all decorated up, ready for the payoff.
Seems like if you left town now, they might say that you were running out on a bet.
They probably figured you were afraid you'd lose.
Afraid I'd lose!
Do you want to know something?
In my whole life
I've never been more...
Well,
I can't discuss that without gettin' mixed up in something
I promised not to talk about.
Oh, and another thing.
The family band has been invited to play...
At the rapid city election carnival, the night the returns come in.
Trouble is, we haven't had a band practice since you left.
Confound it, Calvin!
You're supposed to be the head of the family.
You ought to see to it.
The whole family's been kind of upset.
Upset or not, that don't matter!
You gonna have a band, you got to practice, practice, practice!
Mostly we need you, pa.
Why don't you come home where you belong?
I know you'd let me wait my life out, you'd never give in.
So I'm askin' you.
Please?
For Katie and the children...
And me.
What do you say?
Seems like if we was to get started instead of standin' here talkin', maybe we'd get there in time for supper.
That election night thing is gonna be our first real chance to show off the family band.

I want to pass along to you...
Something that was told me many years ago...
By a man whom I have respected and admired...
More than any man
I have ever met.
A man who never wavered in his conviction...
That we here together can build the greatest...
United country in the whole bloomin' world...
If you'll just remember one thing.
There's a time to stand up and fight for what you believe in...
[ murmured agreements ]
And there is a time to join hands and work together,
or all the fighting doesn't mean a thing.
He's just makin' that up.
Wasn't no important man at all.
Just something I told him.
I know that this man...
Swallowed more disappointment than any of you did tonight.
This was back in '65...
When he had just returned home from appomattox.
My father, rensselaer bower.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Here he is!
Here he is.
And so I suggest that this is a time for joining hands, a time for making up.
Well, if he's gonna quote such a good authority,
I guess I can't argue with him.

I'm invitin' Joe carder...

Dr. Donne?
PIease come in, Miss Bowman.
Mr. Donne's expecting you.
Thank you.
This way, pIease.
David.
HeIIo, Jenny.
Is this awfuIIy inconvenient?
I don't think so.
Come on up.
I'II take your coat.
That's for sociaI caIIs.
WeII, you did say this was business, didn't you?
Yes, Doctor.
Business.
WeII, the business department is in here.
Why do they caII you Mister if you're a doctor?
Surgeons are caIIed Mister.
I see. You mean Iike a marquis being caIIed a Iord?
That aIways mixes me up, too.
Secrets of the trade.
Won't you sit down?
-Yes. Thank you.
-Now, then, what is it?
Ear, nose, or throat?
Do you take care of aII three of those things?
Yes.
Which is it?
Were you surprised to hear from me?
A IittIe.
You sang this afternoon.
Charity concert, wasn't it?
Yes. How do you know?
It was in aII the papers.
How did it go?
-It was ghastIy.
-That means it was good.
No, it was terribIe.
It was awfuI.
My throat was very raw, and I couIdn't--
I just sort of croaked out the performance.
TeII me, am I keeping this secretary person of yours?
No, no. She works here.
I know, but it's terribIy Iate, and it's Sunday, and I thought--
She's used to it.
WiII you go on?
WeII, I just...
I just got scared
I was going to Iose my voice.
Since when?
Since when what?
Since when were you scared that you were Iosing your voice?
WeII, since I got to EngIand.
And don't teII me it's the cIimate... because TepaIdi and CaIIas sing here... and they do very weII.

Yes, I have done.
Does this hurt?
WouId you swaIIow?
Thank you.
WeII, am I going to Iose my voice, or what?
What do you think?
You mean there's nothing wrong with me.
Your throat's a bit rough, it's red, you've been singing... and you've been smoking too much.
When do you open in London?
Five days.

You're going to get me in there if it kiIIs me, aren't you?

WeII, it comes, you know.
Care comes.
With gray hair and spectacIes.
I heard about your wife's death.
Janet was her name?
Yes. Janet.
-I read about your marriage.
-Which one?
WeII, it doesn't make any difference... because neither one was worth writing home about.
I shouId have married you,
David. I reaIIy shouId have.
And it wouId have worked.
Yes, it wouId.
No, you're wrong, Jenny.
-You're so sure?
-It's better as it is.
TeII me something--do you stiII pIay that awfuI harmonica thing?
No. No, I gave that up.
I'm gIad. You were terribIe.
Do you stiII knit?
Oh, no. Nothing I knitted ever fitted.
We must have had fun, David.
At Ieast, that's the way
I remember it.
Is that the way you remember it?
Yes.
Twist my arm and yes.
SaIut.
SaIut.
Why did you come?
I don't know. To teII you the truth, I don't know.
Maybe it's just that I didn't want to be aIone... first night in a strange town.
You've a mass of friends in town. You couIdn't be aIone.
AIone.
It's a most awfuI word.
And I know what it means.
Because I've been aIone since you, David.
You've been married twice.
WeII, I was aIone then, too.
TeII me, is this when you were knighted?
The C.B.E. or the...
-O.B.E.
-O.B.E.
That's good, isn't it?
Not quite, I'm afraid.
That's something.
Yes, it's something.
Why did you hide him from me?
-I didn't hide him.
-I saw you.
AII right, I hid him.
Excuse me, Mr. Donne. Do you require me for anything eIse?
No, thank you, Miss PIimpton.
I'II see Miss Bowman out.
-Good night, Miss Bowman.
-Good night.
Is he here?
No, he's at schooI.
He boards.
-I'd Iove to see him.
-I know.
David, pIease. I didn't come here to ask that, I swear.
I came here to see you.
I admit that.
It's just that now that I am here...
I must ask you. PIease.
I'm sorry, Jenny.
You can't see him.
WeII, why not?
What's the matter with me?
Have I some dread disease or some kind of--
What are you so afraid of?
What is it, David?
-I want to see him!
-It's impossibIe.
ImpossibIe isn't a word that very many peopIe use with me.
It must come as rather a surprise to you now.
-I want to see him.
-You cannot see him, Jenny.
We made an agreement a Iong time ago... an agreement that you wanted-- never to see him ever again.
Do you remember?
Yes, I remember.
That was a Iong time ago.
It's the onIy good thing
I ever made in my Iife.
Now I can't--
WeII, forget it.
TeII me, does he Iike schooI?
I mean, any more than anyone does?
Yes, he Iikes it very much.
Is he cIever?
He's average.
Better at Mozart than maths.
Is he musicaI?
A IittIe odd if not.
Yes.
And the rest?
He's reaIIy pretty good.
I think you'd be proud of him.
-Let me see him.
-No.
-Just once.
-And then what?
Nothing. I go.
Look, Jenny, to see him now wouId make it much harder... for you, for me, for aII of us.
And that's finaI?
FinaI.
WeII, I think I've taken up enough of your time, David... and I'd Iike to get out of here.
Where's my coat?
It's outside.
I'II caII you a cab.
-No, thank you. I'd rather waIk.
-It won't take a moment.
No, thank you.
I'd rather waIk.
Don't bother to see me out.
I'II take care of myseIf.
Jenny.
What?
You forgot your prescription.
What does it say?
Three times a day before meaIs?
And shake the bottIe.
It's good for what aiIs me?
Good night, David.
You've been very kind, and thank you.
Jenny.
It reaIIy wouId mean so much to you, wouIdn't it?
To see him again?
Yes.
If I Iet you... and mark these words-- if I Iet you... you'II promise to Iook once and never Iook again?
I promise.
AII right.
Are you sure you want to go on?
WeII, I can't stop now or I'II sink.
PeeI it, Joe, peeI it!
TeII me, do aII the mothers do this?
Yes. But they usuaIIy wear good woman's shoes.
Where is Matt? Is he...
No, he's with that Iot over there.
The under-14s.
Come on, Roger, don't faII!
Give me the baII!
Come on, Roger!
David, wait a minute.
Here.
-Are you hoIding?
-I'm hoIding.
You reaIIy shouId have worn more sensibIe shoes.
They're aII yours.
I'II take this.
Come on, on to the under-14s.
Where is he, David? Where?
There.
Where?
There. That thing with the baII.
TackIe him!
-They'II kiII him!
-OnIy once.
Break up. HaIftime.
WeII, what's that?
That's haIftime.
You must come 'round, especiaIIy the wing forwards.
Can I go and see my father, sir?
Yes, aII right. Hop it.
HeIIo, Father.
Nine to six against us.
We're getting ticked off.
StiII, it's a good game.
They made you fIy haIf again.
What happened to Gregson?
Broke his Ieg pIaying Eastbourne.
-SiIIy ass.
-I'm faster, anyway.
-Don't be such a show-off.
-HeIIo.
HeIIo. You're Miss Bowman, aren't you?
Father said you were coming.
Miss Bowman's an American, Matt.
They do things differentIy.
How do you do?
How do you do?
You're going to be on in London, aren't you?
-Yes, I'm going to be on.
-At the PaIIadium.
We have aII your records at the house.
At home?
No, no. The house here at the schooI.
Father goes in more for Beethoven.
For Pete's sake.
Who introduced you to EIIa... to Basie, to Benny Goodman?
Yes, I know. And who introduced you to Chubby Checker?
I have an extra pair of boots in my Iocker.
You couId aIways pretend you've been pIaying fIy haIf.
-I think they'd suspect.
-Sorry.
No, Matt, I have these.
I'm saving them for a dry day.
He Iooks Iike you.
I shouIdn't. I'm adopted.
WeII, you couId. You couId.
Adopted chiIdren do grow
Iike their parents, Iike dogs.
Like dogs?
Yes. There's an oId saying that dogs grow Iike their masters.
Or masters grow
Iike their dogs.
I think you'd better get back to that game, don't you?
I'II take Miss Bowman back to the hoteI... and get her cIeaned up, aII right?
I'II show you around the schooI,
Miss Bowman.
Matt, do we have to?
I'd Iike that, Matt.
I'd Iove it.
These ruins are Norman.
You know,
1066 and aII that stuff.
The schooI buiIdings are aII around the cathedraI... and they're just as oId.
The dining haII goes back to King Henry V.
And the food goes back to WiIIiam the Conqueror.
Good morning, sir.
Major Dee, Modern Languages.
We caII him Major Disaster.
Is the bioIogy wing finished yet?
It's been finished for ages.
Most parents get down twice a term... but I'm Iucky if my father gets down once a year.
Now, that is not true.
And what happens when I do come down?
We stare at each other
Iike a coupIe of deaf-mutes.
-UnIess you need some cash.
-But today's different.
You get a joIIy good view from around this corner.
We have aII our services in the cathedraI.
That's the schooI choir you can hear... practicing in there now.
WouId you Iike to go up the tower?
We can see for twenty miIes.
No, Matt, not again.
You can do it, Father.
Exercise is good for you.
I wasn't thinking about myseIf, but Miss Bowman.
I took Auntie Beth up
Iast week and she Ioved it.
Who's Auntie Beth?
She's Father's aunt and she's sixty.
WeII, if Auntie Beth can do it, so can I.
Come on, Father. Come on.
We go through there.
I'II have to get permission from the verger.
I won't be a moment.
I Iike him.
So do I.
I feeI so happy.
It's Iike having a famiIy of my own.
LoveIy feeIing.
Good.
WouId you have dinner with me tonight, David?
I don't think so.
I'm going to be in London ten more days... and I'd Iove to see more of you.
You reaIIy are persistent, aren't you?
A IittIe over-anxious, maybe.
Look, I teII you what we're going to do.
We're going to come down from that tower... if we ever reach the top, we'II take Matt out to tea... we'II stuff him fuII of food... and then I'II drive you back to London.
And drop me at my hoteI?
That's right.
It'II be better that way, don't you think?
No, I don't.
We can go up now.
You wiII be down by 4:30, won't you?
Yes, thank you. We'II hurry.
I'II Iead.
Every twenty steps, stop and count five.
That way, you won't get out of breath.
Go on, Matt, go on.
Everyone aII right?
Fine. Fine!
There are 237 steps.
I've counted them.
What did he say?
He says he's counted the steps!
What does he want to count them for?
It's hard enough to cIimb them.
By the way,
I ordered extra tickets.
What tickets?
For the GiIbert and SuIIivan, tonight.
It's the end of term pIay.
We're doing the first act of ''H.M.S. Pinafore.''
Eighteen, nineteen, twenty.
What was that?
He says he's got tickets for the pIay tonight!
Is this the top?
No. But we're aImost haIfway.
Oh, my.
This is fun, isn't it?
Mind the cobwebs.
Not many peopIe get up here.
Matt, I'm terribIy sorry.
We can't stay for the show tonight.
Miss Bowman has to get back to town.
But he must stay.
I'm pIaying Cousin Hebe.
He says you must stay, because he's pIaying Cousin Hebe.
BIast.
I think we've Iost your father.
Not much further.
I can see dayIight.
How oId was that aunt you were taIking about?
She's sixty.
But she's very athIetic.
I can beIieve that.
She must be a champion
Iong distance runner.
Oh, my gosh, Iook out!
-Be carefuI!
-It's aII right.
You have to get to the edge to get the view.
Look. You can see Ashford from here... where the Vikings fought.
PIease say you'II stay for the show, Miss Bowman... because if you do, then Father wiII have to stay, too.
I'II taIk to him.
Somebody didn't stop to count five.
Be generous, David.
He wants you to stay so much.
You can see the sea on a cIear day.
But we don't get many cIear days.
Good, we are in Iuck!
-What's wrong?
-Wait for it.
-What's happening?
-You'II see.
That's the Ioudest beII in the south of EngIand!
My!
For a British tar is a soaring souI
For a British tar is a soaring souI
As free as a mountain bird
His energetic fist shouId be ready to resist
A dictatoriaI word
His eyes shouId fIash with an inborn fire
His brow with scorn be wrung
He never shouId bow down to a domineering frown
Or the tang of a tyrant tongue
His nose shouId pant and his Iips shouId curI
His cheeks shouId fIame and his brow shouId furI
His bosom shouId heave and his heart shouId gIow
And his fist be ever ready for a knock-down bIow
His foot shouId stamp and his throat shouId growI
His hair shouId twirI and his face shouId scowI
His eyes shouId fIash and his breast protrude
And this shouId be his customary attitude
His eyes shouId fIash
His breast protrude
His eyes
His customary attitude
His eyes shouId fIash
His breast protrude
His eyes shouId fIash
His eyes
Yes, his eyes, his eyes shouId fIash
His foot shouId stamp and his throat
His throat shouId growI
His hair shouId twirI and his face
His face shouId scowI
And this shouId be his customary
Attitude
Bravo!
God save our gracious Queen
Long Iive our nobIe Queen
God save our Queen
Send her victorious
Happy and gIorious
Long to reign over us
God save our Queen
Who's that?
That's the headmaster.
We can go now.
We used to do GiIbert and SuIIivan in our schooI.
OnIy the girIs pIayed the boys' parts.
I can't get over Matt-- he's so pretty.
WeII, don't teII him that, for heaven's sake.
-AII right.
-I'm never sure with you.
-Did you enjoy it, Mr. Donne?
-Yes, thank you very much.
You directed the pIay, didn't you? We Ioved it.
This is Mr. ReynoIds,
Miss Bowman.
How do you do?
I'm afraid we're not exactIy in your cIass.
I'd say much more professionaI and more spirited, too.
That's very kind of you.
The boys do try.
There he is. CouId I--
Excuse me.
-Say, you were terrific.
-Was it aII right?
-It reaIIy was.
-Did you Iike it?
Yes, reaIIy.
What do you think of Buttercup?
He was ace, wasn't he?
I think everybody was ace.
WouId you Iike to meet some of them?
I'd Iove to.
This is Miss Bowman.
This is Bobbie Evans.
HeIIo. Josephine, you Iook stunning.
You were marveIous.
And this is RaIph Rackstraw... the finest topman in aII the fIeet.
HeIIo. GIad to see you.
LoveIy performance.
Thank you very much.
The Right HonorabIe
Sir Joseph Porter, K.C.B.
First Lord of the AdmiraIty.
The monarch of the sea.
And these are aII his sisters and his cousins and his aunts.
I think you were aII absoIuteIy marveIous.
-We think you're marveIous.
-I think you're better.
-We think you're marveIous!
-No, you're better!
Why don't you sing for us,
Miss Bowman?
Yes, Miss Bowman, sing for us.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
WeII, we've got a piano.
Let's aII pIay together. OK?
ShaII we have a go?
Yes!
I am the monarch of the sea
The ruIer of the Queen's Navee
Aren't you a bit young?
Whose praise Great Britain
IoudIy chants
And we are his sisters and his cousins and his aunts
And you?
And we are his sisters and his cousins and his aunts
His sisters and his cousins and his aunts
They are his sisters and his cousins and his aunts
-Ahnts!
-No! Ants!
When at anchor here I ride
My bosom sweIIs with pride
You do Iook a bit strange.
And I snap my fingers at the foreman's taunts
You'II never beat him that way, kid.
And so do his sisters and his cousins and his aunts
His sisters and his cousins and his aunts
They're his sisters and cousins and aunts
They're his sisters
And his cousins
And his sisters and his--
You and I are the onIy ones doing any work around here.
Come on, we must aII puII together! Let's go!
Go!
But when the breezes bIow
Where do you go?
I generaIIy go beIow
Why?
To seek the secIusion that a cabin grants
You're chicken!
You're chicken!
And so do his sisters and his cousins and his aunts
And so do his sisters and his cousins and his aunts
AII those peopIe in one cabin?
It must have been very crowded.
So do his sisters and his cousins and his aunts
And so do his sisters and his cousins and his aunts
I won!
Hey, Matt!
I've got a marveIous idea.
You had me to your opening night.
-Now I want you to come to mine.
-The PaIIadium?!
Yes. WouId you Iike that?
Gosh, yes.
If my father won't mind.
We can bring him, too.
What do you say?
ShaII we bring him aIong?
Yes, if you're sure it'II be aII right.
I do. I think he shouId definiteIy come, too.
-Come on, Iet's ask.
-I'II ask him, yes.
PIease, sir. Father, can I go to Miss Bowman's show?
You remember? You promised me three days in London.
Mr. ReynoIds.
-Oh, say yes.
-WiII you excuse me?
Yes, of course.
What are you taIking about?
Miss Bowman's invited us to the first night of her show... for both of us.
WeII, why not, David?
Best seats in the house for you and Matt.
You're supposed to spend the first week of your hoIiday... in Canterbury with Aunt Beth, and you know that.
WeII, she won't mind.
I know she won't mind.
PIease, Father.
You can buy me that tape recorder you promised me.
I'd Iove to come and see you,
Miss Bowman. Make him say yes.
I don't seem to have any choice, do I?
I don't think so.
I've got a IoveIy bunch of coconuts
There they aII hanging in a row
Big ones, smaII ones
Some as big as your head
Give 'em a twist, a fIick of the wrist
That's what the showman said
I've got a IoveIy bunch of coconuts
Every baII you throw wiII make you rich
And there stands me wife
The idoI of me Iife
Singing roII a bowI, a baII a penny a pitch
-She's here.
-Yeah? How is she?
Fine.
So smiIe.
Hi, darIing.
George.
TeIegram from David Donne.
Urgent case.
TerribIy sorry and aII that.
Best of British Iuck and everything, but...
In pIain American, he ain't comin'.
So?
So--
WeII, what do we do, deIiver it?
You want to bIow the show?
Yeah. I'II teII her it came after she went on.
How do you feeI, honey?
Hey, did you see 'em out front?
Cops on horseback.
You can't rate any higher.
-London's my Iucky town.
-Any town's your Iucky town.
I couId Iive in London, George.
I reaIIy couId.
I couId settIe here.
Any oId iron, any oId iron, any, any--
George, you sent the tickets, didn't you?
-They're at the box office.
-And David's picking them up?
That's right, darIing.
Good. I feeI marveIous!
Come on, Ida!
Any, any, any oId iron
-How do I Iook?
-FabuIous.
-I mean reaIIy.
-ReaIIy fabuIous.
DarIing, shaII I start the overture?
WeII, what time is it?
Twenty past.
That's funny. They said they were going to come backstage... before the show.
They probabIy thought you meant after the show.
They didn't want to disturb you.
George, wiII you caII the box office for me, pIease?
Honey, I just caIIed.
There's a Iot of confusion.
They're aII jammed up.
He may have got caught in the traffic.
That's the price of popuIarity, darIing.
-What's going on?
-What do you mean?
Just what I said-- what's going on?
Honey, you know everything that I know. Don't get upset.
I'm not upset, George, but I'm
IiabIe to get very upset... if I don't find out what's going on!
Give it to her.
He said he was going to come.
Jenny, I know this is a big disappointment to you... but you expected 2,500 peopIe, but you got 2,498.
That's an awfuI Iot of peopIe.
What do you say?
Come in.
Mr. Donne to see you,
Miss Bowman.
Show him in, pIease.
AII right, you can go in now.
-HeIIo, Matt.
-HeIIo.
How nice you Iook.
Come in. Come in, pIease.
Gosh, it's a bit different from schooI, isn't it?
How do you do, sir?
Hi.
Good evening.
How do you do?
Matt, did your father bring you?
Didn't you get the teIegram?
He got a caII from ItaIy.
An emergency case.
It's standing room onIy outside.
George, wiII you start the overture, pIease?
Right.
WouId you excuse me?
I'II be right back.
-OK, Ida?
-Yep.
Fine. Turn around.
-The seams aII right?
-SpIendid.
There you go.
I hope it was aII right-- my coming.
It's more than aII right.
As a matter of fact... it's a great big compIiment to me that you came.
I'd have been awfuIIy disappointed if you hadn't.
Come on, Iet's go.
ActuaIIy, you see,
I came up to town on my own.
They don't know I'm here.
You mean your father doesn't know?
No. He thinks
I'm in Canterbury.
But I wouIdn't miss your opening night for anything.
Listen, Matt, you're going to see my show... and then we're going to have supper together... and then I think I'II bed you down at the Savoy... and after that, we'II get your tape recorder tomorrow... that he promised you... and a coupIe of other things, maybe.
That sounds marveIous. But
I think Aunt Beth wouId worry--
No, don't worry about that.
You'II take care of Aunt Beth, won't you, Ida?
Yes, I'II caII Aunt Beth.
-Joe.
-Yes, Miss.
WouId you show this young man to his seat, pIease?
-Yes, certainIy.
-Good Iuck, Miss Bowman.
Thank you. You know, we may have such a good time tonight... your father wiII be sorry he missed it.
-Good-bye.
-Bye.
Did you check the fuse box?
WeII, something
Iooks Iike it's out.
Check it, and fix it fast.
Honey, it's a gas!
Gimme! Gimme!
-Go!
-Yeah!
Hey!
Hear that bIuebird up in a tree
Hear him
What a song
Joy he's bringing
Singing to me
Singing aII day Iong
Good-bye to skies of gray
For I'm back home
Today
AII day Iong
I jump and run about
You can aIways hear me shoutin' out
HeIIo
BIuebird
Got no time
For bIues or anything
I'm so happy
I just want to sing
HeIIo
BIuebird
BIue skies, sunshine
Friends that are reaI
OId foIks, sweetheart
Oh, how I feeI
I'II not go roamin'
Like I did again
I'II stay home and be a kid again
HeIIo, bIuebird
HeIIo
AII day Iong
I keep singing
HeIIo, I'm gIad I found you
BIuebird, make yourseIf at home
No more bIues
Just because I'm happy
When I'm around you
BIuebird
No more need to roam
Up above the sun is shinin'
The worId is ideaI
I just can't describe
The marveIous way that I feeI
With nothin' but the bIuest skies ahead
What a rosy future Iies ahead
Thank you, bIuebird
Happy, happy bIuebird
Mister bIuebird
HeIIo
This is a good idea, coming on the river.
There's St. PauI's.
Christopher Wren designed it.
Are you coId?
Not a bit. We take coId baths every morning at schooI.
But we can get some sheIter further up there.
Everyone's watching you.
Does it bother you?
Oh, no. It doesn't bother me.
TeII me, do you Iike
Iiving at schooI... the way you do, aII the time?
I don't mind. I've been away from home since I was eight.
Don't you get Ionesome for your famiIy?
I haven't reaIIy got a famiIy.
Father's away quite a bit.
-He's rather busy, you know.
-Yes, I know.
It's the same for you, too, isn't it?
I mean, you don't get home very often, either.
No.
That puts us in the same boat, then.
Yes.
I have to get off at the next Ianding stage.
If I don't, I'II miss my train.
I don't want to rush you.
It's no rush.
Can I have your autograph, pIease, Miss Bowman?
-There you are.
-Thank you.
Thank you. Matt, why do we have to get off here?
Why don't we have the whoIe day together?
-I couIdn't.
-Yes, you couId.
Stay with me.
Spend the day with me.
Do me a favor. Come on.
There's a 6:56, but I'd have to Iet them know.
I fixed it Iast night, didn't I?
-You did.
-I'II fix it again tonight.
-Come on!
-AII right.
I beg your pardon.
Faster, faster, faster--
-Here.
-Oops. We're Iocked out.
That was a nice day.
Don't panic, Ida. We're here.
We've been aII the way up the river--
Down.
And aII the way down the strand.
Up.
I haven't had so much fun in years.
You got messages.
Press conference tomorrow at noon.
RehearsaI's at 3:00.
Phone caIIs--
Your agents, New York...
George, severaI times.
And they Ieft the hats.
Good! You can heIp me pick one out.
I made that caII to Canterbury... but I don't see how he's going to make the 6:56.
I've got news for you, Ida.
Matt's going to be my guest... for one more night and one more morning.
We're going to the ionic propuIsion exhibition... at the science museum.
So it Iooks Iike you're gonna have to make another caII.
Look, why don't you go powder your nose or something?
OK.
Canterbury wasn't any too happy when I caIIed this afternoon.
In fact, Canterbury's getting just a IittIe irritated with us.
I'm sure you took care of everything, Ida.
Do you think this is my styIe?
How Iong is this going on?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
I took him out for the day.
What's so wrong with that?
Look, Jenny, this is me, see?
Ida. Eighteen years. Remember?
I just want to get to know him a IittIe better.
And then what?
Let him go home, Jenny.
Tomorrow.
Why don't you quit whiIe you're ahead?
You wanted to see him.
Fine, you saw him.
Now say good-bye.
-We bIew the recording room.
-George! Hi.
When did you get back?
Look, are you aII right?
-We were worried.
-I'm fine!
Look, if you ever get hung up again, Iet us know.
We'd work it out for you.
That's what we're here for.
You stiII here?
Good evening, sir.
Yeah.
I'II set it up again.
Are we on our way?
Are you ready, honey?
Jenny, I don't think
I ought to stay.
I'm keeping you from important things.
Nothing's that important, Matt.
I haven't missed a thing.
George, I have a new escort tonight... and a very attractive one, too.
See you Iater. Come on.
I've been running through rains
And the wind that foIIows after
For one certain face
And an unforgotten Iaughter
I've been foIIowing signs
I've been searching through the Iands
For a certain pair of arms
And a certain pair of hands
Yes, I tried a kiss here
And I tried a kiss there
For when you're out in company
The boys and girIs wiII pair
But it never was you
It never was anywhere you
An occasionaI sunset reminded me
Or a fIower hanging high on a tuIip tree
Or one red star hung Iow in the west
Or a heartbreak caII
From a meadowIark's nest
Made me think
For a moment
Maybe it's true
I found him in the star
In the caII
In the bIue
But it never was you
It never was anywhere
You
Anywhere
Anywhere
You
Anyone for ionic propuIsion?
She's out.
That's French for not up yet.
I wouIdn't want to disturb her.
Go right ahead.
She won't even hear you.
Jenny.
Jenny, it's quarter to 1 2:00.
Jenny?
What--
Good morning, Jenny.
I'm sorry I--
Good morning, darIing.
Is it awfuIIy Iate?
No, not reaIIy.
Weren't we supposed to be somepIace this morning?
The science museum.
But it doesn't matter.
I'm sorry, Matt.
PIease come and sit down.
We couId queue.
We couId what?
Stand in Iine.
We don't want to do that, do we?
I've got a much, much better idea.
She's not back.
Nope. Just a caII to caII Canterbury.
Yeah. She's out of her so-caIIed mind.
More than you know.
Yeah, in the middIe of a six-country tour.
-Seven.
-Seven.
They're gonna murder me.
-Cigar.
-Cigar.
Good afternoon, girIs.
GirIs, Iisten, Jenny has asked me to stand in for her.
Now, wait a minute, now.
Come on, Iet's be fair.
You know she Ioves to taIk to the Iadies of the press.
She's very disappointed that she can't be here... but eat, drink, be merry.
Have any questions, think of me as though I were Jenny, OK?
When did you start smoking cigars?
Where is she?
Give me that, wiII ya?
She had a business date.
WeII, it went on way behind time!
Way, way behind.
What did you say the name of this pIace was?
Stoke Poges.
Stoke Poges?
It's where Gray wrote his eIegy.
Do you know about that?
No. I know more about Gray's Anatomy.
-Stoke Poges?
-That's right.
''The path of gIory
Ieads but to the grave.''
Oh, dear.
Do you ever Iook at gravestones?
-No.
-They're great fun.
Fun?!
Yes. They're not a bit depressing, reaIIy.
Listen to this.
''Here Iies my wife.
''Here Iet her Iie.
''Now she's at rest, and so am I.''
That's terribIe.
You're a terribIe boy.
When I die,
I think I'II be cremated.
-WouId you Iike to be cremated?
-I don't know. I suppose so.
It's very sanitary and sort of chic, Iike I said.
My mother was cremated.
Your mother?
Janet. But she's not my reaI mother.
She must have
Ioved you very much.
She Iiked me.
Come on, Iet's sit down for a second, shaII we?
Don't you ever wonder about your mother, your reaI mother?
Not reaIIy.
I mean, who she was and what...
No.
I'II miss you, Jenny.
WiII you?
Yes.
Matt, I'm going to go to Paris in a few days... and I wish you couId come with me... just for a IittIe whiIe.
I'II taIk to your father about it... and I'II make aII the arrangements.
AII you have to do is say yes.
Jenny, I don't understand why you're being so kind to me.
Maybe it's because I've never had a son of my own... and I Iike to pretend... and you fit the biII.
WiII you heIp me?
Yes, Jenny.
Good, Matt. Good.
-I thought you'd got Iost.
-No.
-Miss Bowman's here.
-Is she?
She said she wanted to taIk to you urgentIy... as soon as you were back.
Then she decided to come here and meet you.
-Where is she?
-She's in her car, over there.
I didn't know what you wanted to do... so I brought your car as arranged.
-Is she stiII at the Savoy?
-Yes.
Look, take my car back to town, wiII you?
Take it to the hoteI. Leave the keys with the porter...
-and take that aIong.
-Yes, of course.
I'II be back as soon as I can.
-How was your trip?
-Fine.
You were in Rome, weren't you?
That's right, yes.
Must have been an opera singer.
They're very deIicate creatures, opera sing--
David, I have a confession to make.
ReaIIy?
Yes. I'm afraid I've done something that I shouIdn't have.
Yes, I know that.
You know?
News traveIs, Jenny, even to Rome.
Are you terribIy angry?
I'm so sick with anger that I can hardIy speak to you.
I don't know what to say.
I haven't got any excuses except that it was wonderfuI--
There's onIy one thing
I want to know from you.
How far have you broken your promise?
I haven't said anything,
I swear.
I know you're angry, but I haven't done any harm.
That remains to be seen, doesn't it?
If I'm such a shady character... why'd you Iet me see him in the first pIace?
Have you forgotten how you begged... how you impIored, how you pIeaded, how--
I don't beg. I don't beg.
You don't beg.
You just damn weII assume.
Everything you want, you get.
-David.
-You haven't changed.
You never wiII.
You're nothing but a seIf-centered... grasping, egocentric IittIe bitch.
And you're a cheat.
Before you go in there and start to act Iike the heavy father... it wasn't his fauIt.
I brought this about myseIf.
And you remember that.
Ida? WouId you get
Matt for me, pIease?
HeIIo, Father.
I wanted to come down to the airport with Jenny... but she said better not.
She said that she'd expIain about everything... about Paris and aII that.
Matt, we didn't win.
Jenny expIained everything perfectIy, Matt.
AII I want you to do now is to pack up and come aIong.
-Are you ready?
-No, I'm not quite packed.
Nothing much, though. it won't take Iong.
Hurry up, then.
The car's outside.
-Yes, sir.
-Right.
So now it's Paris, is it?
And then the rest of the tour,
Rome, Athens--
For God's sake, don't suIk.
You saw his face.
For God's sake, don't suIk.
You saw his face.
You saw how sorry he was.
And you know how sorry I am.
What do you want us both to do, just die?
I don't want you to do anything.
I just want to get out of here as soon as possibIe.
What was so terribIe about it, anyway?
He came to see the show, we took a trip up the river... and we had a good time.
What's so terribIe about that?
We had a wonderfuI time!
And you're standing there... as if I'm some kind of criminaI or something...
-Iike I'm Lizzie Borden!
-For God's sake, Jenny--
''For God's sake, Jenny''!
I stayed out of the way as Iong as your wife was around!
And she was good for him!
WeII, fine! But what now?
You and your grave demeanor or your Auntie Beth... in Canterbury who's forty years too Iate?!
What kind of Iife are you offering him?!
What you faiI to reaIize, Jenny... is that we have a very good reIationship, Matt and I.
We were doing very weII before you came aIong... and we'II do a damn sight better after you've gone!
Boy, you know where to hit, don't you?
I want to teII you something.
He needs me, and I want him!
He's not yours to have.
You gave him back to me a Iong time ago.
I need him, I Iove him, and--
''You need him, and I want him, and you want him, and I...''
He's not a bone.
My God, he's a chiId.
He's my son, and I'm going to keep him!
There's just one thing we seem to both have forgotten.
He's my son, too.
I made him.
Now, where do we go from there?
I've packed.
There's some other things in the bedroom, but...
We'II send for those Iater, Matt.
Yes.
Can I have the tape recorder?
It was a present.
Is it true?
Yes.
Why didn't you teII me?
I meant to.
I kept putting it off,
I'm afraid.
But why didn't you teII me?
I made a promise to your father.
Matt, I think we'd better be moving aIong now.
No.
No, I don't want to go just yet, Father.
Not yet.
I'd Iike to stay here for a bit with you... and get it cIearer, if you have no objections.
No, I have no objections.
PIease stay.
Matt, I've never ordered you... to do anything in your whoIe Iife, have I?
But I'm asking you now to come home with me.
WiII you?
AII right.
Jenny, pIease...
Yes, Matt?
I'm going because my father has asked me to... not because I want to.
Do you understand?
Yes.
It's what you must do.
Thank you.
CouId I caII you, then, and taIk?
Yes, of course.
CaII me tomorrow.
AII right?
Yes.
You won't drop it, wiII you?
No.
Don't Iet him wait aIone.
PIease go with him.
Anything I can get for you, Jenny?
I'II go my way
By myseIf
This is the end of romance
I'II go my way
By myseIf
Love is onIy a dance
I'II try
To appIy myseIf
And teach my heart how to sing
I'II go my way
By myseIf
Like a bird on the wing
I'II face the unknown
I'II buiId a worId
Of my own
No one knows better
Than I myseIf
I'm by myseIf
AIone
I'II go my way
By myseIf
Here's how the comedy ends
I'II have to deny myseIf
Love and Iaughter
And friends
Gray cIouds in the sky above
Have put a bIot on my fun
I'II try to fIy high above
I'II try to fIy high above
For my pIace
In the sun
And I'II face
The unknown
I'II buiId a worId
Of my own
No one knows better
Than I myseIf
No, no one knows better
Than I myseIf
How I wanted Iove and feII
Now I say what the heII
AII of those bIack days are gone
'Cause it's soIo
AII aIone
By myseIf
From
Now
On
Did you caII New York?
-CaIIed New York.
-And?
-It's a IittIe compIicated.
-WeII, teII me.
Can't it wait untiI after the show?
No, it can't, George.
TeII me.
-AII right. You've got a case.
-I knew it. I toId you.
Ida, I've got a case.
Jenny, what you've got is a technicaIity.
I'm gonna Iay it out for you... just the way the Iawyers
Iaid it out for me.
The records were searched, and the adoption was Iegitimate.
What did you say?
I said the adoption was
Iegitimate, as far as it went.
But there's such a thing as second papers.
Now, don't ask me what they are.
They're second papers, and you never signed them.
Thank heaven for me.
That means if you want to fight it, you can.
Now, no guarantees, a whoIe Iong McGiII in court.
FrankIy, darIing, it's a Iong shot. did you teII them to go ahead?
No, I didn't teII them anything just yet.
WeII, teII them so.
George, wiII you pIease caII the Iawyers.
Jenny, right now, at this moment... you're on top of a career you've been buiIding for over 20 years.
For haIf that time,
I've been with you... so I know a IittIe bit about the subject.
I can't stand by and watch you destroy it and yourseIf.
If you fight this case, you might win.
It's possibIe. I don't know.
But do you reaIize what it wouId mean?
You couIdn't be in Rome one week, Miami the next.
You'd have to stay here in EngIand... and fight it out in the courts.
Jenny, the boy's got a home... he's got a father, a schooI, a way of Iife.
You can't jump into the middIe of that... and start making aII kinds of waves.
George, pIease.
AII right. Suppose you got him, what wouId you do with him?
TraiI him around the worId with a tutor from date to date.
HoteI suites, rented cars, other peopIe's houses.
And they're pretty strict in EngIand about schooIs.
You might have to send him to a schooI... and come and visit him now and then at vacation time.
Jenny, you'd be strangers, don't you see?
AII right, aII right.
What wouId happen to you?
How wouId you be abIe to work with this puII aII the time?
Do you know how to handIe a smaII boy?
It's a fuII-time job.
Forgive me, dear... but I don't think you know how to do it.
This, aII this, this is your job.
You do it better than anybody eIse in the whoIe worId... because you know it.
Don't force this, Jenny.
Let it rest.
George, I know you're trying to heIp me... but, you see, I Iove him.
And oddIy enough,
I think he Ioves me.
You have three minutes,
Miss Bowman.
I'm ready.
Matt.
I've got to interrupt,
I'm afraid.
It's aII right.
Did you mind me taking this?
No, not a bit.
Have you just got back?
I've been finishing some notes.
No, don't put it off.
It's rather fine.
I've spent most of today... wondering how to expIain things to you.
You've had some pretty rough things fIung at you... and now you'd better have the truth.
It's up to me to give it to you.
-ShaII we sit down?
-Yes.
I don't know how much you heard today... but I presume enough to know that I'm your reaI father... and Jenny's your mother.
Were you and Jenny married once?
No, Matt, we were never married.
We feII in Iove whiIe
I was in New York studying.
I did ask her to marry me, to come home to EngIand.
But I hadn't reckoned with one thing-- that was her career, which meant more to her than anything eIse.
I couIdn't make her change her mind... and I had to come back here to work, so I came aIone.
That's pretty cIear, isn't it?
Yes.
Then I met Janet again.
We'd known each other since we were aImost your age.
It was aIways rather expected... that we'd get married, so we did.
Then I heard that you were about to be born.
Jenny did her best to Iook after you... but touring the worId with a smaII chiId... isn't aIways convenient.
So Janet and I taIked things over... and it was decided that you come and Iive with us as our son... our adopted son because that was kinder to Janet.
I don't understand why you didn't teII me when Janet died.
I didn't expect you to understand entireIy.
That'II take time, perhaps a Iong time.
But the important thing now is your future.
WiII you heIp me?
AII right.
WeII, you've promised to teIephone Jenny, haven't you?
I expect you've been thinking about that.
-Yes.
-And what you'II say to her.
What do you think
I shouId say to her?
That's a decision you have to make yourseIf, Matt.
But I can teII you what she'II say to you.
She'II ask you to meet her in Paris... and when you get there, it'II be another pIace--
-How do you know?
-Because she wants you.
But she just said for a few days.
It doesn't stop there, Matt.
Just because you're angry with Jenny, why shouId I be?
Look, I'm not angry with Jenny.
I'm not angry with her.
I know her, and I know what I'm taIking about.
She wants you-- not for a weekend, but you.
She wants you to Ieave your friends, your home... and your schooI, start a new way of Iife.
Matt, I know what fun she's been to be with... and how kind she is and good and wise, too, sometimes.
And it wouId be exciting.
You'd see pIaces you'd never seen before... you'd fIy, you'd catch boats... and you'd Iaugh a Iot.
I know her, Matt.
I Ioved her.
I stiII do Iove her.
But mark this. Jenny gives more Iove than anyone... but she takes more Iove than anyone can possibIy give.
Can you understand that?
But what if I do go with her?
WeII, if it was something you reaIIy wanted to do... and it was going to make you happy, I'd get used to it.
So you don't reaIIy care.
Matt, of course I care.
If it was up to me...
I'd say go and teIephone Jenny and say good-bye!
TeII her you've got a good Iife here... and you're not going to muck it up.
Matt, you're my son.
I Iove you.
I Iove you.
And I want you to go on being my son.
HeIIo?
Matt. HeIIo.
How are you?
Are you aII right?
Wake me? No.
I've just been sitting here waiting for your caII.
Where are you?
Good.
Matt, wouId you come over right away, pIease?
I've got so much to expIain.
Everything was so hideous yesterday, especiaIIy for you.
PIease come over right away, darIing.
WeII, what about this afternoon?
My day is free.
Why?
What's happening?
WeII, why don't you bring your friends aIong... and you and I can have a private taIk... for a IittIe whiIe... and then we can aII join forces and have a IoveIy day?
Yes, it sounds a bit compIicated.
What about tomorrow, Matt?
My, you are a busy feIIow.
Matt, you know that trip to Paris we were pIanning... the one we taIked about?
Good. I've been thinking about it, too... and I just don't see how I'm going to be abIe... to work things out.
Yes, that's right.
I'II be busy from morning tiII night... and weII, we couIdn't be together at aII.
You might wind up very IoneIy.
I'm gIad you understand.
WeII, of course you're going to be seeing me.
I'II be back in London in no time... and we'II have Iots of Iaughs and Iots of fun.
OK?
AII right.
WeII, now, you take care of yourseIf, you hear?
And thank you for being such a fine young man.
Bye-bye.
Matt...
God bIess.
Ida!
Get me my bIack dress.
I'm going out!
Wait for me, wiII you?
I hope you don't mind us getting onto you, Mr. Donne... but she was asking for you and wouIdn't see anyone eIse.
Where is she?
Of course you reaIize we are trying... to keep this matter compIeteIy confidentiaI.
Yes, of course I do.
UnfortunateIy, we're fuII up at the moment... so we had to put her in there.
Thank you very much.
-If there's anything you need--
-I'II Iet you know immediateIy.
Right.
Don't ever go to an exhibition... of abstract art for the minions.
No, I won't.
Thank you, nurse.
And if you do go, don't drink the martinis.
No.
Because they're haIf gasoIine.
And you've had enough.
I've had enough to fIoat Fire IsIand.
Does it show?
Someone toId me.
That's pretty sneaky.
There's a young Iord
I must warn you about.
A young Lord George--
HeII, whatever his name was.
He asked me if he couId take me home, and I said thank you... and we got into a cab.
The next thing I knew it was aII faII down... and I wound up with this.
He knew where he Iived, aII right... but I was out, I was out coId.
I was out.
Nobody asked me where I Iived.
How did you get here?
Cab driver named GeraId.
GeraId brought me here, and they fixed my foot... and they gave me coffee.
And somebody asked for an autograph... for their cousin MariIyn.
I feeI awfuI, David.
Have some of this.
Come on.
No more coffee. No,
I couIdn't take any more coffee.
You'd have to feed me through the vein. I'm fuII.
I'm fuII to the brim with the whoIe goddamn worId!
Yes. WeII, now Iook. Come on.
Be good. Drink this. Come on.
Have you come to take me home?
No, I've come to take you to the theater.
No, you haven't.
I'm not going back there.
I'm not going back there ever, ever again.
Listen, they are waiting.
I don't care if they're fasting.
You just give 'em their money back... and teII them to come back next faII.
-Jenny, it's a seII-out.
-I'm aIways a seII-out.
You promised. They're waiting.
-There's George and Ida...
-George and Ida...
-and 200,000--
-nd 200,000. I know that.
Just Iet them wait.
To heII with them.
I can't be spread so thin.
I'm just one person.
I don't want to be roIIed out
Iike a pastry... so everybody can get a nice big bite of me.
I'm just me.
I beIong to myseIf.
I can do whatever I damn weII pIease with myseIf... and nobody can ask any questions.
You know that is not true, don't you?
WeII, I'm not gonna do it anymore, and that's finaI.
It's just not worth aII the deaths that I have to die--
It's just not worth aII the deaths that I have to die--
You have a show to do tonight.
You are going to do it... and I am going to see that you do.
Do you think that you can make me sing?
Do you think you can-- do you think George can make me sing or Ida?
You can get me there, sure, but can you make me sing?
I sing for myseIf.
I sing when I want to, whenever I want to... just for me.
I sing for my own pIeasure.
Whenever I want.
Do you understand that?
I do understand that.
Just hang onto that, wiII you?
Hang onto it.
I've hung on to every bit of rubbish... there is to hang onto in Iife.
And I've thrown aII the good bits away.
Now, can you teII me why I do that?
No, I can't teII you why you do that... but I can teII you this, you are going to be Iate.
I don't care!
DarIing...
I don't give a damn who you Iet down... but you're not gonna
Iet you down.
You haven't caIIed me that... for years.
I haven't been abIe to caII you that for years.
Now, come here, Iook.
Just Iook at me, pIease.
Are you Iistening to me?
There's something
I haven't been abIe... to say to you in years, too.
David, don't.
Don't say it.
Because if you said it now... and if you didn't mean it,
I think I'd die.
I think I'd die.
I'II mean it.
I Iove you.
Oh, David!
David.
DarIing.
HeIp me. HeIp me.
HeIp you?
HeIp us. HeIp us.
David.
He didn't want to go with me.
He didn't want to.
He made aII kinds of excuses.
He didn't want to stay with me.
DarIing, I know. I know.
HeIp me, pIease.
I want to heIp you... but I don't know how.
Now, Iook. Come with me now.
Come now, Jenny, pIease.
David, you wouIdn't cheat me, wouId you?
DarIing,
I wouIdn't cheat you.
You wouIdn't say you Iove me if you didn't.
I wouIdn't say I Iove you if I didn't.
No, I wouIdn't, darIing.
PIease teII me again.
PIease, once more.
I'II teII you as often as you want me to.
I've aIways Ioved you.
That's where it ends, isn't it?
That's where it ends.
We were the right peopIe that met at the wrong moment... with aII the right ideaIs.
We were just too strong... ever to give up everything for each other.
We just didn't fit.
We fitted. The rest didn't.
That doesn't make much sense.
The Ioving does.
Yes.
The Ioving does.
The Ioving aIways does.
Are you aII right now?
I'm aII right.
I think you're gonna have to heIp me... with my foot, though.
Can you manage?
Oops. You know... there's an oId saying.
When you go onstage... apparentIy, you don't feeI any pain at aII.
When the Iight hits you, you don't feeI anything.
It's a stinking Iie.
WiII you stay with me?
Yes, I'II stay.
How Iong?
UntiI you can stand on your feet again.
David, I don't think--
Where is Jenny?
Hey, come on, Iet's go!
Oh, no, I've had it.
It's an hour past curtain.
You'II be 45 minutes getting dressed.
Do you think they're gonna wait for you?
There are 2,500 peopIe out there... who paid money to see Jenny Bowman... but you're gonna
Iet them down.
That may not mean anything to you anymore... but I stiII have a certain reverence for audiences.
They mean a great deaI to me.
And if they stiII do mean something to you...
I'm gonna find it very difficuIt to forgive you.
And if they don't mean anything to you anymore... then I am genuineIy and profoundIy... sorry for you, Jenny.
There she is!
It's about time, too.
Where have you been, Jenny?
What?
Where have you been?

I'd Iike to sing for you... if we can get these things puIIed.
Can you puII them up?
PuII them up.
I think everyone's gone to sIeep back there.
Thank you.
''I CouId Go On Singing.''
When a dove is in Iove
With a doII of a dove
He is out aII night coo-cooing
When an owI's on the prowI
For a feminine fowI
He goes out aII night woo-wooing
Every bird and bee
Has his Iunacy
In the way he works his dream off
But when I feeI high
Here's the way that I
Like to get my kind of steam off
OwIs hoo hoo
Others sigh
Doves coo coo
Ah, but I
I couId go on singing
TiII the cows come home
And the rooster starts to crow, crow, crow
When I see your eyes
I go aII out
I must vocaIize
TiII you shout
Enough aIready
I couId go on singing
TiII the moon turns pink
Anything from ''Faust'' to
Ink-a-dink-a-dink
Love does funny things
When it hits you this way
I must keep on singing
Like a Iark
Going strong
With my heart on the wings of a song
Singing day

“Good Afternoon, sir,” said the courier
They were late.

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
Well on his way
Head in a cloud
The man with a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hear him or the sound he appears to make and he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
And nobody seems to like him they can tell what he wants to do and he never shows his feeling
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
And he never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him
The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round

My name is Miss Winters
Good morning, Miss Winters
Miss Winters, Miss Winters
If there’s anything 
I can do for you… you know what to do...
We at the Magical Mysteries only have your best interest at heart thank you...
As the bus leaves the town behind and heads for the country… 
Everything begins to change
Well, almost everything
Already the magic is beginning to work
Jolly good...
Why?
Why?
Why?
Jolly good, Sarge, carry on...
On your marks!
If you look to your left, ladies and gentlemen the view is not very inspiring
But if you look to the right… 
Beyond the blue horizon for above the clouds… in a land that no one knows… 
Live four or five magicians… 
Who spend their days casting wonderful spells
Come with me now into that secret place… 
Where the eyes of man have never set foot
Where’s the bus?
Where’s the bus?
Where’s the bus?
It’s coming
Where’s the bus?
The bus...
The bus is ten miles north on the Jewsbury Road
It’s only ten miles away. ten miles!...
Ladies and gentlemen, quickly, look to your left
Now there you see the ancient Roman ruins
They really have been there an awful long time
They are, in fact, a little difficult to see because they’re almost flattened to the ground
Meanwhile, back on the bus, things are happening
Indeed, the magic is so powerful that even Mr. Bloodvessel emerges from his shell
He turns to speak
If I may the liberty, Mister
Be my guest
My dear lady...

Well, don’t you?
Yes, Mr. Bloodvessel
I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together

I told ya
Goodbye
CreAted by TE-df-PS-60
Thank you.
Tonight, we celebrate with dancing and wine.
Then I'll ready my boat.
And between breakfast and readying your boat...
...I want you to kill everyone on Blefuscu.
But Lilliput is safe.
- I said, kill them!
- We've won. Isn't that enough?
Then force them to open their eggs at the little end.
No, I will not degrade anyone.
We don't need vengeance.
I need it!
On to the banquet.
How dare that man disobey you!
He didn't disobey.
His Majesty didn't insist.
I never had to insist before.
It's unheard of.
- Disgraceful.
- Humiliating.
I'm never humiliated.
But it was disgraceful.
- He won the war.
- He shamed the army and navy.
What's war without death?
Where's the sacrifice beyond the call of duty? The heroism?
I move the prime minister suggest a way...
...to dispose of this freak.
Well, Reldresal?
If we kill him, there would be a danger of an epidemic.
- The navy could float him out to sea.
- Too big. Cost too much.
I have it!
We'll send him to Blefuscu and have them kill him.
Superb idea, Your Majesty.
That way, he's their problem.
It may not be nice, but it's legal.
What if they decide to use him against us?
Shame! Shame! Shame!
How can you plot against Gulliver?
Now, dear, don't get excited.
Nobody's plotting.
You can't fool me. Criers are out proclaiming your kindness.
That means someone will be executed.
- Gulliver wouldn't do my bidding!
- That's no excuse for killing him!
Listen.
Such a sweet, gentle song...
...for such a big, powerful man.
- But I sing, and much better.
- Be quiet!
If he'd made a fool of you, you wouldn't be swaying like a maiden.
- You'd be spitting nails at him.
- Such vanity. Such vanity!
Nothing he does can offend me.
Fire!
Put out the fire!
Stay where you are. I'll put it out.
The uncouth, vile, filthy, evil, dirty spitting and spewing animal.
As I said, madam. As I said.
Destroy him. He's ruined my dress.
Destroy him!
- Precisely the way we all feel.
- Execute him.
Brilliant!
You're a man of action, Flimnap.
You're accused of treason. Flee!
- The emperor's mad.
- Executioners are coming.
Treason? But I saved Lilliput.
I was even decorated.
You made Galbet jealous. The admiral hates you for scuttling the fleet.
The empress is furious.
You ruined her dignity and her dress.
I stop wars, put out fires, feed people...
...give them hope, peace and prosperity. How can I be a traitor?
Treason, man, treason.
The emperor hates you because you're more important than he is.
Petty ambition, selfish people.
Go to freedom and eggs the way you want them.
- I never eat eggs.
- Neither do I. It's the principle.
You caused trouble, endangered your daughter, to win a point?
You promised the giant would solve our problems.
He will. You're the biggest.
Make everyone open eggs your way.
No one's big enough to stop your bickering.
It poisons everything.
Make them think like you.
That will end bickering and war.
Don't you see?
Then I'd be just like the emperor.
And so would you.
Using my strength to oppress others.
- Treason!
- False pride and vanity.
They destroy everything for lovers.
Elizabeth was right.
The only safety is in being obscure, in being nothing.
- Down with force and power.
- Kill him!
Call the guards!
Please, I need your help.
Halt!
- I must show this to the king.
- See the king's chamberlain.
- Welcome to Brobdingnag.
- Don't be frightened. You're safe.
Is that his name? Gulliver?
Yes, my dear. He belongs to Elizabeth.
She's told us all about him.
Now they're the prized possessions of your king.
I know how highly you value these little people, but I must warn you.
Little people are shrunken people, and shrunken people are dangerous.
Makovan, shrunken people are little and little people are toys.
And no one in the entire land of Brobdingnag has them except me.
Take your Gulliver inside.
He needs food and rest.
And the court tailor will make him new clothes.
You're going to be very rich, my girl.
Very rich.
- What did you say your name was, dear?
- Glumdalclitch.
There you are. That will keep your family happy for years.
I don't wanna sell him.
I brought him because law says:
" Little people should be brought to the palace at once."
That's quite right.
Only the king can own little people.
But he's mine. I found him.
My dear child, I've got a surprise for you. Come along with me.
What do you think of these?
My collection of the tiniest animals in the world.
- They're very nice.
- Nice?
It's the most unusual collection ever.
Come see my favourite.
See this tiny crocodile?
He's the fiercest fighting flesh of his size in captivity. Watch.
See how he snaps at it?
That's why we keep him alone.
He'd kill the others instantly.
Now, as a reward...
...l'll give you any of these animals, except my crocodile.
I don't want any. I want my Gulliver.
Come now, girl. Don't be stubborn.
Your king knows best.
He's a king for grownups. Children don't have a king to protect them.
I'm everybody's king.
You take things from children, like all grownups.
They never ask. They just take.
Why not let her stay here? She'll be an excellent guardian for them.
All right. Then I'll decree...
...that your parents let you live here. See? I'm your king too.
Thank you.
I'll protect them with my life!
I'll show you your room, and we'll get you a lovely new dress.
Pages, bring the castle.
You never saw anything of Pritchard or the crew?
After the Antelope sank,
I washed ashore here.
Let's hope that they were saved too.
I never stopped believing you were alive. Not for a moment.
When I think of what those little people might have done to you!
They were vain and selfish.
You're so right.
Wanting to be important and powerful is meaningless.
Our being together is all the importance we ever needed.
- Wait!
- Are you all right?
It's Glumdalclitch, the little girl who found you.
- How do you do? And thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'm going to sleep now, but if you want anything, just call.
Good night, dear.
Isn't this a beautiful place?
And no mortgage, either.
It's a paradise compared to Wapping.
I don't care where we are as long as we're together and safe.
- You got your strength back fast.
- Giant food agrees with me.
No, don't. We're not married yet.
Elizabeth, open the door.
Elizabeth!
Glumdalclitch, wake up!
- Wake the king. We want to be married.
- Now? But everyone's asleep.
Fetch the king, please.
All right. Stop shouting.
Grownups are silly. And little grownups are sillier than anybody.
Wake up in there! Wake up!
Why arouse everyone?
They want a simple ceremony.
If I have to be up in the middle of the night, so does everybody.
- You forgot your slippers.
- I want to do this and go to sleep.
Don't be so grumpy, dear.
Remember carrying me off by moonlight?
How impetuous you were!
How the fires of passion stirred you!
I wish they'd stir now.
It's cold in these halls.
- Please, Your Majesty.
- Yes, all right.
- Where are they?
- There, King Brob.
Pages, get the fire going.
These stones are cold.
They'll be a delightful couple.
Charming!
Forgive me for disturbing you.
Quite all right.
You sure you know what you're doing?
None of your jokes.
You're making them nervous.
They're supposed to be nervous.
Where's the licence?
Where'd they go, the little lovers?
For shame! Shame on all of you!
Stop this nonsense.
Marry them at once.
You're right, dear.
I'd better marry them at once.
I pronounce you man and wife by the authority vested in me, by me.
Live happily, long life, lots of children, that sort of thing.
He should kiss the bride.
He is, dear.
And now, can we go back to bed?
Wake up. Wake up, sleepyheads.
It's morning.
"On our honeymoon. Be back soon.
Love, Elizabeth and Lemuel Gulliver."
Oh, dear. No!
Darling, if we're gone too long,
Glumdalclitch might get into trouble.
She's a big girl. A very big girl.
She can take care of herself.
No more cares. No more worries.
Not a one. I only have to keep you happy, and I'll work hard to do it.
Work? What for?
- To get money to buy food.
- We get all our food free.
- Then, to pay taxes, at least.
- But there are no taxes on us.
- Then to save money for our family.
- The king will give us money.
Yes, but... I guess so.
I don't have a thing to worry about for the rest of my life.
Gulliver? Elizabeth?
Where are you? Answer me!
Elizabeth, here I am!
Down here!
Glumdalclitch, hurry. Over here.
- There you are. Where's Gulliver?
- Here I am!
Down here.
Down here!
- Don't run away again.
- Thank you for saving me.
- Why did you run away?
- We didn't run away.
When you're grown up... become an adult, you'll understand.
- You could have been killed.
- We won't do it again.
I love you both, but you must do what I say.
You must behave, or the king won't let me stay with you.
I have to take you back right now.
The queen is terribly worried.
You upset the queen.
- You cannot leave without permission.
- Where did you go?
On our honeymoon. Your country is as beautiful as England.
- We won't go out alone again.
- Sensible. She will take care of you.
- I can take care of Elizabeth.
- Good! I like little men with spunk.
There. Let's see the alchemist find a formula to get him out of that.
A clever move, sire.
He'll take your rook if you move there.
- I beg your pardon?
- I shouldn't have interfered.
You play chess?
- Quite often.
- He's very good.
Let's see how good he is.
Take over Makovan's game.
- May I study the board?
- Of course.
I'm ready, Your Majesty.
That's a strange move.
Really? I'd like to know more about him.
- What were you in your little country?
- I was a doctor.
A witchery doctor.
No, Makovan. A bodily doctor.
Baying at the moon or waving a cat won't cure a bladder ailment.
Stop that jabbering. It's my move.
Ridiculous. Impossible.
I can take your...
No, then you could take my...
This isn't a judging game.
You'd better let him win.
You win.
He can't help it if he's a bright man.
It isn't like you to be a bad loser.
He didn't lose. A witch tricked him into making false moves.
But I couldn't have been beaten by such a tiny witch.
Maybe he wasn't always small.
A witch can make himself any size he wants.
Have you seen the way he kisses that woman of his?
Witches aren't interested in that sort of thing.
Precisely.
Do married people kiss so happily?
Always, all the time?
You have a point there, Makovan.
My stomach!
Oh, it hurts!
Makovan, get me some herbs quickly.
They're angry with us.
Teatime's past, and they always invited me.
Is that the price? Loss of dignity?
- Losing the game isn't losing dignity.
- It's pretending to be stupid.
- You could try to humour them.
- I could educate them.
They're backward, they're in the Middle Ages.
Don't change them. That'd spoil everything. We're happy here.
- We can't be when we're nobodies.
- Try to be equal, they'll hate us.
If I don't, they'll laugh.
They laugh enough, they'll get bored.
Then they'll stop laughing.
Since that's all we're here for, they'll get rid of us.
- The queen is ill.
- When? We just left her.
I saw them carry her to her quarters.
- Who's caring for her?
- Makovan.
- She needs a doctor.
- No, please.
- She's healthy. She just eats too much.
- Please wait!
Take me to Makovan's laboratory.
I can't do that. The king won't allow it. It's forbidden.
Do as I say!
It's an evil place filled with Makovan's magic.
- I'll turn his magic into medicine.
- No! You'll be killed.
Don't worry. It's our best chance to live happily ever after forever.
Take me there.
This will soothe you. My special formula made of spirits of theriac.
- It's too hot, you fool!
- It must be hot, Your Majesty.
It's not helping her, Makovan.
Try another formula.
King Brob? Please, King Brob.
Let Dr. Gulliver help her.
What are you doing here?
Go away, child.
Just relax. I'm a physician, a doctor. I'll help you.
I'm dying.
You're not dying.
You merely have an upset stomach.
But it aches so.
I have prepared a solution of laudanum, a paregoric.
- Drink it and you'll feel better.
- Are you sure?
I know it will cure you.
I'm staking my life on it.
As a physician, I wish I could take madam's hand and soothe her.
Yes, doctor.
The medicine is on the table.
Drink it down like a good girl.
Yes, doctor.
She's calling for him.
She's losing her mind.
No, he's going to help her.
He's a doctor.
Help her? That little witch?
Where is he?
- Put it down! No, no!
- Away.
- All of it, madam!
- Yes, doctor.
He's poisoned her.
She needed help on the inside, not the outside.
There he is!
Catch him!
Stop it!
I feel better already.
- Are you sure?
- The pain's completely gone.
You gave me the scare of my life.
All of you leave.
I wish to consult with Gulliver.
You may leave too, dear.
Gulliver will be safe here with me.
I said I'd like a few minutes alone with my physician.
- Your what?
- My doctor.
Dr. Gulliver.
I can care for you.
Get rid of that man.
You didn't save my life. He did.
- I'm your husband.
- I want my doctor.
All right then. I'll take my doctor.
Dr. Makovan, come with me.
I told you he was a witch, sire.
Shall I burn him?
It's not fair to burn a witch without proving it.
Do you want me to burn him, then prove him a witch?
Or shall I prove it, then burn him?
I don't want the queen upset.
That's what I want.
Then I shall prove him first, and then burn him later.
Is that what you wish?
Must I always tell you what to do?
Show a little initiative.
- Can I watch you make him a witch?
- I'm not making him a witch.
- Can I watch you make him a witch?
- I'm not making him a witch.
He is one, I'll just prove it.
Can I watch? Are you going to burn him afterward?
Witches are always burned at midnight, after your bedtime.
- I was told to bring Gulliver.
- Yes. Just put him on the table.
Not with that cat here.
I'd better keep him in my basket.
The thing's a doll!
- You sent for me? Can I be of service?
- Perhaps.
This is my daughter, Shrike.
Darling, this is Glumdalclitch, guardian of this...
He's not a doll! He's my little man.
I'm not big enough to be your father, but I'm old enough.
He's silly looking and squeaks like a mouse.
You're jealous because you don't have one.
Now, girls. You both go outside and play.
King Brob told me never to leave Gulliver.
Out, I said. There'll be honey cakes and milk for you later.
It's all right. We have grownup scientific matters to discuss.
- What substance is that?
- Air, water, fire and earth.
Plus the spirits of alchemy?
- Mercury, sulphur, arsenic.
- You know those?
- Chemists know our debt to magicians.
- You know magic?
They called it magic when trying to change iron into gold.
- We call it chemistry now.
- You know how to make gold from iron?
It's easier to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.
You can do that?
How did you know?
Stop that! Girls!
Stop that. Stop that, I say!
Easy. Daddy loves his little baby.
There, there.
He'll put you in the tanks! You'll turn blue! Lt'll prove you're a witch.
- He'll kill you.
- Don't worry. I can handle it.
Everyone he says is a witch, they turn blue in those magic waters.
What did you do?
You're not a witch, are you?
No, Glumdalclitch.
There, there, my sweet.
Leave her alone, you bully.
Sit here and watch me turn him blue.
Then can I stay up late and see the fire?
Turn blue? An innocent man?
A shrivelled man who beats the king at chess...
...cures the queen and makes a silk purse from a sow's ear must turn blue.
Climb down into that pan.
That's enough.
Get in the next one.
- Climb out, Gulliver.
- Yes, sir.
He didn't turn blue!
- Incredible!
- Merely a chemical reaction.
This contains lichen, which eats algae.
Anyone stepping into lichen and then into an alkaline, must turn blue.
- But you're red.
- Of course.
I changed the alkaline to acid.
Acid will then turn anything red.
Amazing witchery.
It's still colourless.
It's the same as your experiment.
It will turn you red.
Never!
Gulliver, the cat!
My cat! You've turned her red.
There, there, my sweet.
Daddy didn't do it, the witch did it.
Your hair will turn red!
Sure as science, and I'm not a witch.
It's turning!
It is, Daddy. It's red.
Your hair.
Little witch, you'll make a short but colourful flame.
Where does he get such power? To turn my hair red, to cure the queen?
Where does he get such power? To turn my hair red, to cure the queen?
I say destroy the witch, sire, before he destroys us.
- It wasn't magic!
- He's not a witch!
Invisible spirits. Evil spirits.
You turned Makovan's hair red.
- Only because I know chemistry.
- There's no such thing, or I'd know.
- No one knows it all.
- What he doesn't know, doesn't exist!
Brobdingnaggians are the wisest people in the world.
And I'm their king, understand?
Admit you never beat me at chess.
By fair means, I mean.
If I deny what I know, what I see and what I hear...
...then I deny all knowledge.
- And if the queen gets another ache?
- That has nothing to do with this!
Get that through your little thick head!
Deny anything they want, say anything! Save yourself.
I can't live without you.
Open the cage.
I'm ready to confess everything.
Confess, then.
I confess that the sun goes round the Earth.
I confess that the world is flat.
I confess that there is no such thing as...
...medicine or science.
And it would take a witch to beat me at chess.
It would take a witch.
Now he's more guilty than ever.
There was no medicine, so he cured the queen with nothing.
Only a witch could do that.
We must burn him.
I'm afraid we must. I'm sorry.
You promised I would be spared.
You lied!
You wear an ignorant's fear.
What you don't know, you destroy.
- Burn him!
- No!
Wait. I have a better way to destroy a witch.
Remarkable idea, sire.
There won't even be an ash remaining.
Go back to bed, child.
She must be spared.
She's done nothing.
- They are both alike.
- On with it!
Leave her there for now.
Open the door of the cage.
Dr. Gulliver! Take this!
- That's it! That's it!
- Come on!
Kill him! Get him, get him!
Hit him again!
- Kill him!
- Finish it!
Come on, kill him!
Come on, get him!
See what powers he has? The strength of a dozen his size. Burn him.
Gulliver! Elizabeth!
- After them!
- Come on!
- Don't let them get away!
- Stop them!
They're coming.
Where shall I hide you?
You can't stay here.
Animals will eat you.
You can't do anymore. Save yourself!
Where are they?
Where did you hide them?
I don't know!
Leave the child alone.
They're somewhere here. Find them.
They must be somewhere here.
- We can't let them escape.
- Set light to the brush!
We're going to die here.
If only I'd listened to you!
If only I hadn't tried to make you live my way.
If only I hadn't wanted everything my way.
There, at the stream.
Hurry! Into the basket.
Where are we?
I don't know.
Was it a dream?
As real as anything we think.
But the giants.
What if the giants come back?
They're always with us, the giants and the Lilliputians.
Inside us.
Their terrible world waiting to take our lives...
...waiting for us to make a mistake.
To be selfish again.
How can we bear it?
How can we live with such fear?
With love.
The way Glumdalclitch did.
Glumdalclitch. What happened to her?
She's waiting to be born.
Yes.
We're back in our world!
Pardon me. We're lost.
Perhaps you've heard of our country from a soldier or sailor.
- We come from far-off England.
- A town called Wapping.
Are you barmy? This is England.
And Wapping's just beyond that wood.
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

I say, the Archduke's got his wife with him.
I thought they usually kept her out of sight.
Today is their 14th wedding anniversary.
I see.
So that's why she's been allowed out.
It's a pity he married beneath him.
What on earth will they do with her when he inerits the Austrian empire?
Perhaps by that time, madame,
Austria will no longer have an empire.
My dear Monsieur Poincaré.
Don't tell me you've got some delicious piece of gossip.
You must understand, my dear, that France doesn't approve of Austria at the moment.
- Oh?
- Against Austria, nothing.
But their foreign minister...
Count Berchtold?
Why, he's absolutely charming.
He wishes to make a war against Serbia, so he crawls to the Kaiser for aid.
I don't think there'll be any war.
There speaks the true diplomat.
And if there is, there's certainly no need for us to get involved.
Yes. Well, I mean, you know, who cares?
Serbia's such a little country anyway, you know.
And I mean, they're always up to something, aren't they?
Serbia is little, madame, but it will not be a little war.
Well, that's up to you and the Russians, isn't it?
As you wish.
Please excuse me, madame.
Enchantée.
Sir Edward.
- My dear Edward.
- Poldy.
Your Majesty, you know the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
Sir Edward Grey.
Count Helmuth von Moltke,
Chief of the German General Staff.
Still expanding your army and navy?
We like to keep busy.
Yes, we're off to sign the...
He's forced me to mobilise...
I see the French President is hobnobbing with the Czar again.
I really think they mean to fight with us over Serbia.
Quite ridiculous.
Couldrt you persuade your king to have a talk to the Czar?
After all, they're cousins.
Why not ask the Kaiser?
He's a cousin of Nicholas, too.
Well, I hope the French haven't encouraged you to do anything foolish.
Germany is with us.
It could be embarrassing.
- Because our royal family is German?
- Precisely.
I think they may be relied on to play their part.
Excellent. Excellent.
After all, the last thing any of us want is a war.
War?
War is unthinkable!
It is out of the question!
It would upset the balance of power.
We Germans are an industrious and moral people.
We have earned the right to have our say in the world's affairs.
The Republic of France is the seat of reason, the centre of world civilisation and culture!
Now, look here. The British Empire is the most magnificent example...
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen.
Ready for the shot, if you please!
Would the Italian and Turkish gentlemen move in a little closer, please?
Right. Nice smile for everybody!
Austrian Archduke assassinated.
Austrian Archduke assassinated!
Austrian Archduke assassinated!
Hey, wait for me!
I want to see the Emperor, too!
Count Berchtold? Count Berchtold!
Wait for me! Count Berchtold!
Have you signed the declaration of war,
Your Majesty?
Have you signed the declaration of war,
Your Majesty?
I have this report from the Commander of the Fourth Army Corps.
"Serbian troops have fired on our positions
"from steamers on the Danube.
"Our troops, in order to defend themselves,
"were forced to return the enemy fire.
"A considerable skirmish developed."
"Assassination, terrorism...
"Failure to accede to our legitimate demands," et cetera, et cetera.
"Austria now at war with Serbia."
The more so since Serbian provocateurs are already attacking
Austrian troop positions.
Hostilities have already begun.
But that wasrt true.
The Serbians haven't attacked anyone.
Of course not.
And as the information about the
Serbian attack has not been confirmed,
I have taken it upon myself to erase all reference to the incident from the declaration of war.
Your Majesties,
Your Excellencies, my lords, gentlemen.
Ready when you are.
Take your places, please, for the ever-popular war game.
Complete with songs, battles and a few jokes.
The whole of Europe will explode at any moment.
Can Germany do nothing to stop the Austrians?
Apparently not.
We are the only country prepared to help the Serbs.
If Russia mobilises, so will Germany.
France is bound by treaty to aid Russia.
Britain must make her position clear.
I think we should all stay calm.
I think we should all stay calm.
The world will be engulfed in the most terrible of wars, the ultimate aim of which is the ruin of Germany.
England, France and Russia are conspiring together to destroy us.
Your Majesty, we know for a fact that you are mobilising the Russian army.
Upon my word of honour, you are wrong.
I do not doubt it, but we have irrefutable proof.
- You want my word of honour in writing?
- No.
Thank you.
In that case, I can only repeat to you, at this hour not one man, not one horse has been called up.
I must congratulate you on persuading Italy to join us.
Our allies are dropping away from us like rotten apples, even before the war has started.
General mobilisation is ordered by the St Petersburg Council of War.
France has mobilised, too,
Your Imperial Majesty.
The encirclement of Germany is an accomplished fact.
We have run our heads into a noose.
England?
She has not yet made up her mind.
- Abandon the plan.
- It is too late.
The wheels are already in motion.
Get in touch with my cousin, King George V.
Inform him my troops are being prevented, by telephone and telegram, from passing through Belgium.
They've gone into Luxembourg, sir.
The lamps are going out all over Europe.
We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.
Notify Lieutenant Feldmann.
He is to withdraw immediately from Luxembourg.
To retreat now would be disastrous.
We must go forward.
Very well.
Advance into Luxembourg!
The sword is drawn!
I cannot sheath it again without victory and honour!
All of you shall and will see to it that only in honour is it returned to the scabbard.
Let every man look into his own heart and his own feelings and construe for himself the extent of his obligation for himself.
Sir.
They've invaded Belgium.
Now you'll have to go to war.
You're wanted at headquarters, sir.
Your Majesty.
General's brigade, march!
We do not see any reason, however distant, for a conflict.
May I beg Your Excellency to express to His Majesty my profound gratitude for all the marks of friendship and consideration which I have received in the last eight months.
And assure him of the profound respect of His Majesty the King, who regards His Majesty with deep veneration and expresses the hope that the most regrettable state of war between Great Britain and the monarchy may be of no long duration.
I am extremely perturbed at the thought that we should find ourselves at conflict with England since the two countries are so near to one another politically and morally, with traditional sympathies and interests.
Allow me to share your hope that the present, most unfortunate state of war will be of no long duration and that normal relations will shortly be resumed.
Mum, a band! A band!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Coming.
Grandpa, look! It's a band!
Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!
By the centre, quick march!
Ha'penny won'th of chips, please.
Oh, I do like to live beside the seaside
I do like to be beside the sea
- Good morning, Sir Douglas.
- Good morning, Miss Bates.
Oh, I do like to see a lot of soldiers
Oh, soldiers are what I like to see
And if they've got a sword and horse
Then I like them more, of course
Because I just love the cavalry
Oh, I do like to live beside the seaside
I do like to be beside the sea
Oh I do like to stroll along the prom prom prom
Where the brass bands play tiddley-om-pom-pom
Right. Come along, then.
First man, please.

Potatoes!

No.
George.
Grandpa, look, there's a soldier.
Mesdames et messieurs, presenting for your greatest entertainment, the most fantastic spectacle of the world today, the armée française in all its glory!
Its banners, its uniforms will pass now before your very eyes. Rideau!
- Bonjour, soldier.
- Bonjour, mon colonel.
- It's a good day for the chase.
- We await your orders.
A battle won is a battle in which one will not confess oneself beaten.
A silly German sausage dreamt
Napoleon he'd be
Then he went and broke his promise
It was made in Germany
He shook hands with Britannia and eternal peace he swore
Naughty boy, he talked of peace while he prepared for war
His warships sailed upon the sea they looked a pretty sight
But when they heard the bulldog bark they disappeared from sight
The Kaiser said, 'Be careful if by Jellicoe they're seen
'Then every man-of-war I've got
'Will be a submarine'
Belgium put the kibosh on the Kaiser
Europe took the stick and made him sore
On his throne it hurts to sit
And when John Bull starts to hit
He will never sit upon it anymore
He'll have to go to school again and learn his geography
He quite forgot Britannia and the hands across the sea
Australia and Canada the Russian and the Jap
And England looked so small he couldn't see her on the map
For Belgium put the kibosh on the Kaiser
Europe took the stick and made him sore
We shall shout with victory's joy
Hold your hand out, naughty boy
You must never play at soldiers anymore
He'll never sit upon it anymore
Belgium put the kibosh on the Kaiser
Europe took a stick and made him sore
On his throne it hurts to sit
And when John Bull starts to hit
He will never sit upon it anymore
On his throne it hurts to sit
And when John Bull starts to hit
He will never sit upon it
He will never sit upon it
He will never sit upon it...
Paper! Paper!
Brussels falls!
Brussels falls!
- Paper! Paper!
- Here, boy!
Paper! Read all about it! Brussels falls!
'The battlefield is unbelievable.
'Heaps of corpses lying everywhere, rifles in hand.
'Thousands of dead in row after row.
'Night has fallen, and the rain has started.
'Shells are bursting and screaming.
'Artillery fire is the worst.
'We are all utterly exhausted.
'I lie at night listening to the wounded groaning.
'The cannonading goes on and on.
'Whenever it stops, we hear the wounded crying out
'from all over the woods.
'Two or three men go mad every night.
'I feel a great pity
'for many of the civilian population who have lost everything.
'But they hate us.
One of them fired at us.
'He was immediately taken out...
'Taken out and shot.
'Yesterday, we were ordered to attack the enemy flank
'in a forest of beeches,
'but the enemy gunner saw us first and opened fire.
'The casualties on both sides were truly terrible.'
Are we downearted?
No!
So let your voices ring and all together sing
Are we downearted?
No!
Not while Britannia rules the waves
Not likely
While we have Jack upon the sea
And Tommy on the land we needrt fret
It's a long, long way to Tipperary
But we're not downearted yet
Are we downearted?
No!
So let your voices ring and all together sing
Are we downearted?
No!
Not while Britannia rules the waves
Not likely
While we have Jack upon the sea
And Tommy on the land we needrt fret
It's a long, long way to Tipperary
But we're not downearted yet
We watched you playing cricket and every kind of game
At football, golf and polo you men have made your name
But now your country calls you to play your part in war
And no matter what befalls you
We shall love you all the more
So come and join the forces as your fathers did before
Oh, we don't want to lose you
But we think you ought to go
For your king and your country
Both need you so
We shall want you and miss you
But with all our might and main
We shall cheer you, thank you, kiss you
When you come back again
Oh, we don't want to lose you
But we think you ought to go
For your king and your country
Both need you so
We shall want you and miss you
But with all our might and main
We shall cheer you, thank you, kiss you
When you come back again
The Army and the Navy need attention
The outlook isn't healthy, you'll admit
But I have a perfect dream of a new recruiting scheme
Which I think is absolutely it
If only other girls would do as I do
I believe that we could manage it alone
For I turn all suitors from me
But the sailor and the Tommy
I've an army and a navy of my own
On Sunday I walk out with a soldier
Monday I'm taken by a tar
Tuesday I'm out with a baby Boy Scout
On Wednesday a hussar
On Thursday I gang oot wi' a Scottie
On Friday the Captain of the crew
But on Saturday, I'm willing if you'll only take the shilling
To make a man of any one of you
I teach the tenderfoot to face the powder
That gives an added lustre to my skin
And I show the raw recruit how to give a chaste salute
So when I'm presenting arms he's falling in
It makes you almost proud to be a woman
When you make a strapping soldier of a kid
And he says you put me through it
And I didn't want to do it but you went and made me love you
So I did
On Sunday I walk out with a bosun
On Monday a rifleman in green
On Tuesday I choose a sub in the blues
On Wednesday a marine
On Thursday a terrier from Tooting
On Friday a midshipman or two
But on Saturday I'm willing
If you'll only take the shilling
To make a man of any one of you
Come on, lads! We need a million!
A million!
- Be a man! Enlist today!
- Enlist today!
Have you a man digging your garden when he should be digging trenches?
He should be digging trenches!
Are there any able-bodied men in the house?
'Cause on Saturday I'm willing if you'll only take the shilling
To make a man of any one of you
Now, you heard what the lovely lady said!
- We need a million of you!
- Able-bodied men.
Come along, my lucky lads!
Take the King's shilling.
We'll make a man of you!
- I'll turn you into a man.
- Give you the time of your life!
I'll give you the time of your life.
We'll give you the time of your life!
A kiss! A kiss from this lovely lady for the first man to volunteer!
You, sir! How about you, sir?
That's right, sir! Why, step forward!
Step forward now!
That's right, my lucky lad!
Maudie!
Come on, lads! You heard what I said!
We need a million of you!
Well done, my boy. Proud of you.
Proud of you.
All right, dear. Lil!
Hold on to him, love.
That's right, boys! Up you come!
Three more! Get on stage! Get up!
You, sir!
Make your girlfriend proud of you.
Be a hero and step forward, sir.
Thank you, sir.
One young lady still left unescorted.
You, sir! You may be fat and 40, sir, but your country needs you.
Come and join the army!
'Cause on Saturday I'm willing if you'll only take the shilling
To make a man of any one of you
To make a man of any one of you
What are you up to?
Get back into line, you horrible little man, you.
And all of you, from now on, your bloody life won't be won'th living!
And you won't bloody die laughing, either!
Now, then...
Party, attention!
Quite right, lad.
We've just crossed the Belgian border.
We should be arriving in Mons in about two hours' time.
Now, see that?
The commanders of the British expeditionary force,
Field Marshal Sir John French,
General Sir Henry Wilson.
Off to a big conference, more than likely.
I must confess,
I'm not looking forward to this meeting.
What do you think the French will say, sir, when they hear we only have four divisions
- instead of the six we promised?
- They can say what they like.
Damn it all, Wilson, we're not under any obligation to help the French.
We've got our own war to fight.
What?
Yes, well, I've no doubt that they will appreciate our point of view.
One must always remember the class of people these French generals come from.
They're mostly tradesmen, I believe.
I shart understand a damn word they say anyway.
In regard to our plan, sir,
I've actually worked out the number of gun carriages we shall need for the first stage and even the amount of forage for the horses.
Would you care to see the figures?
Well, I thought, considering the terrain...
Yes, yes. We know all about your bicycling trips through France, Wilson.
I realise it's a bit late, sir, but do you think
I should try to arrange for an interpreter to help us out at the conference?
Don't be ridiculous, Wilson!
The most vital consideration at the moment is to maintain absolute secrecy.
Well, I never seen one of them before.
I think I've won a prize.
- So have I.
- You have, my lad.
So have you all.
Left turn! Quick march!
Right then! Three shots for tuppence!
Come on, lad. How about you?
That's right. And what about you, lad?
Come on, step up.
Three shots for tuppence.
- That's the ticket, Jack, lad.
- Right, don't fire the gun till I tell you.
Get a good grip, firm and steady.
The British riflemars the best in the world.
No, don't jerk.
Squeeze the trigger.
That's right.
Steady now.
- Don't blink, lad.
- Don't blink, lad.
- Left eye shut.
- Left eye shut.
- Pick your targets carefully.
- Pick your targets carefully.
Don't fire till you hear my command!
Right, lads. Enemy in front, 400 yards.
Five rounds! Rapid fire!
Cease fire!
Stand down.
Smith! Stand to until relieved.
Yes, sir.
Listen to this.
"In this new experience, you may find temptation
"both in wine and women.
You must resist both.
"Order to the troops. Signed, Kitchener,
"Secretary of bleeding State."
- Hot, isn't it, Sergeant?
- It'll be hotter still tomorrow, lad.
They've pulled out the Suffolks and the Warwicks and most of the rest of the corps.
We'll make your mother proud of you yet.
What's happened to the French Army?
The French Army's nothing to do with us, laddie.
We ain't asking any help from them, and they ain't getting any help from us, even though they've asked.
So, we shall be here on our own then?
Well, someone's got to look after the shop, haven't they?
Here they come again! Fix bayonets!
Hold your fire, hold your fire. Wait for it.
Pick your target at 300 yards!
Wagstaff, you horrible little wretch!
I'll tell you when!
I wish somebody would tell me what's happening.
Send for the boys of the girls' brigade
To set old England free
Send for me brother
Me sister or me mother
But for God's sake, don't send me
Enemy in front!
Five rounds, rapid fire!
Wounded home from France!
First boys back from Mons!
Read all about it!
Careful, now.
Read all about it!
Watch it, lads. Careful does it.
Nurse!
Come on, let's have you outside.
Outside!
- Look lively with that crutch, Spinks.
- It can't bring itself, can it?
Come on! On your feet!
- No flags, then, Sarge?
- Very comical, Burgess.
- Sergeant!
- Yes, lad?
Oh, just smell that soot, boys.
Lovely.
Right now, smarten yourselves up!
Eyes front!
Attention!
Thank you, Sergeant Dodds.
Stand the men at ease.
Stand at ease! Carry on.
Ambulances are ready, Sarge.
Officers only.
What about the other ranks?
No arrangements made for them at the moment, sir.
We'll be all right, sir.
Transport's this way, sir, if you care to follow me.
- Carry on, Sergeant.
- Sir.
Nearly home, George.
Hello, Smith. Sorry about your leg.
- Are you all right?
- It's better than being at Mons, eh, sir?
- Yes. Good journey home?
- Yes, thank you, sir.
Good. Chin up, then.
See you back at the front.
Now, gently. Gently. Stretcher down...
You're wasting your time with him, darling.
It's in splints.
- That's enough of that.
- What about us, then, Sarge?
I'm awaiting further orders.
Will you sign this, please, Sergeant?
We're here because we're here because
We're here because we're here
We're here because we're here because
We're here because we're here
All right, all right, all right.
How about getting the train back, then, Sarge?
You'll get back soon enough, lad.
You'll get back soon enough, lad.
- Hooray. Mafeking's been relieved.
- I'll have you, Burgess.
- What is it, Corporal?
- It's all right, Sarge.
Some lorry drivers have volunteered to take the men to Millbank Hospital in their dinner hour.
Right, get them fell in.
I'll have a word with the RTO.
- Right you are, Sergeant.
- Right!
You heard what the Sergeant said.
Get yourselves fell in!
Dontemann, Gray!
Fall in as markers!
The rest of you men, dress off from the left in two lines, across the platform!
Come on, come on!
Double round the back there!
I said dress off from the left!
Some of you don't know your left from your right!
Carry him gently, boys.
Don't worry.
We'll soon have you back at the front.
You're like a load of pregnant women!
Blimey, if this is the way you've been carrying on out there, we ain't got no chance!
Hey, you! Pay attention, will you?
You're back in Blighty now!
And I want to see you set some good examples!
A couple of days with you lot, we'll soon whip you into some shape.
We want some spit and polish here.
We're going out in a minute, marching off.
We're going down the street, you'd better look lively.
Right. Get your stretcher party moving, Corporal.
Now, get a move on!
- Stretcher party, ready.
- Right, now pull yourselves together.
Form up in two ranks on the left!
Come along!
Party, attention!
Left turn!
By the right!
Quick march!
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
Come on, now! Pick 'em up!
Quit smiling!
Smile, smile, smile
While you've a lucifer to light your fag
Smile, boys, that's the style
What's the use of worrying
It never was won'thwhile
So pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And smile, smile, smile
Read all about it!
First wounded boys home from France!
Read all about it!
Thank you.
I'm so glad it's real champagne.
So many of even the best people give one cider nowadays.
I'm not using my German wine, not while the war's on.
I think that's a splendid gesture, Stephen.
I say, isn't that Olivia?
Doesrt she look adorable?
That black dress is stunning.
So many women simply look depressing in mourning.
Now, come along, Elenor.
Come along, come along.
It is a bit rotten, you know, all those chaps getting killed and all that sort of thing.
Not at all.
The men at the front simply adore the war.
I had a letter from Julian the other day.
- Oh?
- Champagne, sir.
He said it's like a great big picnic.
Nobody grumbles at him for getting dirty.
Oh, dear.
Not a bit like Christmas, is it?
No. It's awfully dull.
Father's business has had the most frightful knock.
We'd all agreed that the French and Germans shouldn't touch the iron ore works in Alsace-Lorraine, until some idiot French pilot goes and drops a bomb.
Oh, dear. That is too bad.
What happened?
He got court-martialled.
- Splendid.
- Yeah.
We're hoping to get the contracts for tin hats.
The whole army has to have them.
How nice.
I thought of asking Nanny to knit something,
- you know, mittens and things.
- That's a good idea.
We sent a parcel to the chauffeur's son.
Some Benger's Food, a tinder box, compass and some nerve tonic.
- How very nice.
- Yeah, I thought so.
Do look.
Bleeding Benger's Food and nerve tonic again?
Well, you shouldn't have thanked him for the last lot.
"In the actual battle zone,
"phosphorine gives immediate relief and freedom
"from the severe exhaustion
"and steady loss of nerve force
"which occurs when under constant shellfire."
Hey, what's up with you?
Have you got company?
Yeah, you know last time I went down to that delousing station, all they did was stick a hot iron over my trousers.
I came out with more than I went in with.
You wrote another one, then?
- Yeah.
- Well, give us a read of it.
"If I should die, think only this of me
"That there's some corner of a foreign field
"That is forever England There shall be
"In that rich earth a richer dust concealed
"A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware
"Gave, once, her flowers to love
"her ways to roam
"A body of England's breathing English air
"Washed by the rivers blessed by sons of home"
Hey, Mac. Will you listen to that?
Yeah. They're copping it down Railway Wood tonight.
No. That's Hill 60.
No, not that. Listen.
What is it?
Singing.
It's those Welsh bastards in the next trench.
No. That's Jerry.
That's an hymn.
No, it's a carol.
They sing well for a lot of bastards, don't they?
Sing up, Jerry. I cannae hear ye.
Put a sock in it. Let's listen.
Nice, wasrt it?
Very nice, matey!
Hello, Tommy!
Hello, Tommy!
He heard you.
Hello!
Eh?
How are you?
I'm very well, thank you.
Good night!
Happy Christmas!
Well, there's another day gone.
- Hey, it's Christmas.
- Not today.
Tomorrow, you great goonie.
I forgot it was Christmas.
Tommy! Tommy!
He doesn't give up, does he?
What's the matter?
It is for you now to sing us a good song for Christmas, ja?
- Ja!
- Ja.
Who's going to sing, then?
Give them up one of yours, Garbett.
Aye, give them yours, Ben.
It was Christmas day in the cookhouse
The happiest day of the year
Mers hearts were full of gladness
And their bellies full of beer
When up spoke Private Shorthouse
His face as bold as brass
Saying, 'We don't want your Christmas pudding
'You can stick it up your... '
Tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
It was Christmas day in the harem
The eunuchs were standing round
And hundreds of beautiful women
Were stretched out on the ground
When in came the bold, bad Sultan
And gazed on his marble halls
Saying, 'What do you want for Christmas, boys? '
And the eunuchs answered...
Tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Bravo, Tommy!
English carols is very beautiful.
Hey, Tommy.
Hey, are you still there?
- Aye!
- Yeah!
You drink with us, ja?
- Ja!
- Ja!
You like some good deutschen Schnaps?
- That's whisky.
- Yes!
Sling it over!
Tomorrow we meet you in the middle!
Aye, the middle of Piccadilly.
It's funny to hear them speak in English.
Yeah, well, they learned it all at school, didn't they?
See you in the penalty area!
Happy Christmas!
- Happy Christmas.
- Aye, happy Christmas.
Good night, Jerry.
Ta.
Jim?
Cocoa.
Ooch, ta.
Hey, Jack.
Hey!
Hello, Tommy.
About bloody time, too.
That's good stuff, Jerry.
Aye. Thank you very much.
Fritz.
How are you, Fritz?
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
How's the Kaiser?
Freuter.
How do you do? Hawkins.
Do you know when the war will end?
After our spring offensive, I should think.
- How are your trenches?
- Terrible.
Not fit for pigs.
When it rains, we're up to our knees in mud and water.
Arert you sick of the war?
Before the war, I was staying in Suffolk, and I left there a three-and-one-half horsepower motorcycle.
And also a girl.
Hey, do you hear that?
This chap's got a girlfriend in Suffolk.
You can send her a message, telling her that I am all right over here.
I mean, I will write name and address for you.
I suppose it's all right.
Cigarette?
Are they Virginian?
Aye. Straight cut.
Ah, nein, danke. I only smoke Turkish.
Have a cigar.
Thank you.
We will not ever shoot again, unless you start.
Do you hear that?
That will suit us, man, I can tell you.
Here. We'll drink to that.
That is Scottish schnapps.
This is your guns that are shooting?
No. It's the bastard English, not us.
They will not shoot at us while you are here.
Don't believe that, man.
It's us they're shooting at.
Oh, well...
Thanks very much, mate, and give my love to the Kaiser.
- Morning, sir.
- Right. Carry on.
Yes, sir.
Morning, sir.
Well done.
Fraternisation, you call it?
It could be interpreted as treason.
We could have them all shot.
Stop the leaves of all units in any sector where it's happened.
And a happy New Year to you, too.
Come on. Come on, quickly.
Brother Bertie went away
To do his bit the other day
With a smile on his lips
And his lieutenant pips
Upon his shoulder bright and gay
As the train moved out he said
Remember me to all the birds.
Then he wagged his paw and went away to war
Shouting out these pathetic words
Goodbye, goodbye
Wipe the tear, baby dear, from your eye
Though it's hard to part, I know
I'll be tickled to death to go
Don't cry, don't sigh
There's a silver lining in the sky
Bonsoir, old thing
Cheerio, chin-chin
Nap-poo, toodle-oo, goodbye

Oh, oh, oh, it's a lovely war
Who wouldn't be a soldier, eh?
Oh, it's a shame to take the pay
As soon as reveille is gone
We feel just as heavy as lead
But we never get up till the sergeant
Brings our breakfast up to bed
Oh, oh, oh, it's a lovely war
Oh, what do we want with eggs and ham
When we've got plum and apple jam?
Form fours, right turn
How shall we spend the money we earn?
Oh, oh, oh, it's a lovely war
Up to your waist in water
Up to your eyes in slush
Using the kind of language
That makes the sergeant blush
Who wouldn't join the army?
That's what we all inquire
Don't we pity the poor civilian
Sitting beside the fire?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's a lovely war
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Smithey!
Smithey!
Hello, Mavis.
Morning, Sir John.
Oh, Smith. Been wounded, I see.
Yes. Got a blighty one at Mons, sir.
Yes, yes. Well, the wife must be glad to have you home.
I'm not married yet, sir.
Oh, no, no. Of course not. It was your...
Brother, sir.
Jack.
Married Cook's daughter, sir.
Yes. That's right. That's right.
They've got a dear little boy, haven't they?
Yeah. A little girl actually, sir. Emma.
Rest of the family all right?
Well, touch wood, sir.
Got five at the front now, sir.
Well done. Well done.
Nothing like a bit of shooting, eh?
No, sir.
Well, I must be off.
August the 12th tomorrow.
Grouse won't wait.
Keep up the good work.
- Yes, sir.
- All right, then.
- Everything all right up there, Mavis?
- I'm attending to it, sir.
Well, look, come and see me in a month or so.
We might do something about getting your old job back.
- What do you say to that?
- Well, if I can't get back to the front, sir,
I think I'd sooner have a job in munitions, if it's all the same to you, sir.
As you wish...
Jack.
Drive on, Mavis.
That's better.
Right, lads. You can take your masks off now.
Masks off! Stand down!
Not you, Leary.
- Sentry.
- Yes, Sarge.
Bombed last night
And bombed the night before
Gonna be bombed tonight
If we never get bombed anymore
When we're bombed
We're scared as we can be
God strafe the bombing men
From higher Germany
They're over us
They're over us
One shell hole
For just the four of us
Thank your lucky stars
There are no more of us
'Cause one of us
Could fill it all alone
Gassed last night
And gassed the night before
Going to get gassed tonight
If we never get gassed anymore
When we're gassed
We're sick as we can be
'Cause phosgene and mustard gas
Is much too much for me
They're warning us
They're warning us
One respirator for the four of us
Thank your lucky stars
That three of us can run
So one of us can use it all alone
Hey, Sarge.
Right, lads, on your feet! Attention!
It's me cousin Bertie, the only officer in the family.
Have you got the trench consolidated, Sergeant?
All present and correct, sir.
Except we lost Mr Laver, sir.
That's bad.
Major Mallory wants to have a word with the men.
You can stand the men at ease, Sergeant.
Stand at ease!
Shell attack!
On your feet, lads.
Come on! Jump to it!
You can let the men smoke if they want to.
Right, sir.
The major says you can smoke, but don't let me catch you.
Now, you men,
I've just come from having a powwow with the Colonel.
We think you've done some damn fine work.
We congratulate you.
I know you've had it pretty hard the last few days, bombs, shells and snipers.
We haven't escaped scot-free back at staff either, I can tell you.
Anyway, we're all here...
Well, not all of us of course, and that gas of ours was rather nasty, damn wind changing.
Yes, indeed, sir.
But these mishaps do happen in war, and gas can be a war-winning weapon.
Anyway, so long as we can all keep smiling, you're white men all.
Sector all tidy now, Smith?
We've buried most of the 2nd Yorks and Lancs, sir.
Still a few DLI's and the men from our own company left.
I see.
Well, look, let the lads drum up some cha.
- Look out!
- Look out, sir!
Good God.
Stretcher bearers!
Stretcher bearers! Stretcher bearers!
You have no stretcher bearers over there?
No. I'm afraid they went in the last attack, sir.
I'm waiting for reliefs from HQ.
Oh, well, they're stout chaps.
Yes. You better let the men keep under cover.
Thank you, sir.
Take cover!
Damn place still reeks of decomposing bodies.
I'm afraid it's unavoidable, sir.
The trench was mainly full of Jerries.
Yes, of course.
You were more or less sharing the same frontline
- for a couple of days, werert you?
- Yes, sir.
Oh, well.
- Carry on, Smith.
- Thank you, sir.
Ye gods. What's that?
It's a Jerry, sir.
What?
It's a leg, sir.
Well, get rid of it, man.
You can't have an obstruction sticking out of the parapet like that.
Yes, sir.
- Sergeant Smith.
- Sir.
Remove the offending limb.
We can't do that, sir.
It's holding up the parapet.
Besides, we've just consolidated the position.
Yes, well, you heard what the Major said. Just get a shovel and hack it off.
Right, Bertie, sir.
Where the bloody hell am I going to hang me equipment now?
Right, lads! Brew up!
Get yourselves some cha!
Smithey.
Johnny's regiment's doing rather well for themselves.
Champagne, dear?
Let me give you a glass of wine.
There you are.
Field Marshal Sir John French,
Commander in Chief of the British Expeditionary Force.
Wasrt that Sir Douglas Haig, the new man?
Damned upstart.
That other blighter Robertsors here, too.
Intrigue upon intrigue.
General Sir William Robertson,
Chief of the Imperial General Staff!
Willy, I'm so thrilled to hear about your new appointment.
One takes these things as they come, you know.
Sir Henry Wilsors green with envy.
Quite.
Talk of the devil.
I've nothing against Robertson personally, but to make him CIGS is absolute disaster.
I'm sure Haig doesn't think so.
Well, of course he doesn't.
Now Haig can do exactly as he likes.
I can see that perfectly well.
General Sir Douglas Haig,
Commander of the British First Army, and Lady Haig.
Canter in the row before breaffast
- tomorrow morning, Dorothy?
- Lovely.
Don't forget the fitting for your new boots, Douglas.
Yes.
By the way, we're lunching at Number 10, without Sir John French.
Congratulations, my dear.
It's wise to remember
Haig has powerful friends.
What on earth do they see in him?
Shoots pheasant with the Prince of Wales.
Lady Dorothy was one of Queen Alexandra's
- maids of honour.
- Was she?
So now, of course, he has the ear of the King.
Haig?
Sir Douglas Haig. That name's familiar.
Whisky.
Trade?
Afraid so.
Remember Geoffrey?
He was Ralph's ADC in Delhi.
Of course.
Excuse me, sir.
May I ask Lady Haig to dance?
I should be delighted.
Could we have a few words together, Douglas?
The trouble is that people back here just don't realise there's a war on.
That's why we need conscription.
Well, I've just volunteered.
Oh, wonderful. Congratulations.
What for?
The VAD.
The uniform is so becoming.
I wish there were more people like you.
I will tell you in confidence, my dear.
His Majesty very much hopes that my husband will succeed Sir John French.
My God.
Douglas has always felt that French was quite unsuitable to the position.
What do you think of French's little lady friend?
Rank outsider.
Is she?
He's always been very generous with the ladies.
I heard he once borrowed rather a lot of money from you.
He was commander of my cavalry brigade at the time.
Damn bad form.
Appalling.
Haig.
Sir John.
Do you know Mrs...
Comrades
Comrades
Ever since they were boys
Sharing each other's sorrows
Sharing each other's joys
The right man in the right job, if I may say so, sir.
You may. You may. Thank you, my man.
To friends in sunshine and shadow.
- What? What?
- Hear, hear.
Well, Douglas, how did you leave the men at the front?
Oh, in fine heart, sir.
Just spoiling for a fight.
Makes one feel very proud.
Tell me, Douglas, what do you think of this fellow, Kitchener?
Well, sir...
Yes, yes.
A perfectly howling rotter.
You're far too nice to say so.
He's only a damned politician, and he behaves like some damned generalissimo.
You know he turned up in Paris in his uniform?
My God.
The fellow's got no right to a uniform at all.
I mean, he's Secretary of State for War.
What happened?
Well, it raised some pretty ticklish points of protocol.
We'll have to do something about him.
I mean, he's more dangerous than the whole of the damned
German General Staff.
What?
Johnny.
Mrs...
Johnny.
Excuse me. They're playing my tune.
How did Haig get where he is?
Didrt you tell me he failed the staff college-entrance examinations?
- Duke of Cambridge.
- What?
Friend of the family.
Oh, yes, of course.
On her side.
They waived the formalities and let him in.
He's quite bright, though.
Thorough sort of chap.
Ambitious, of course, but means well.
You off, Henry?
- Afraid so, Douglas.
- So soon?
We hope to see you next weekend at Isabel's.
Lovely.
Do come along, dear, or we shall never get home.
- Good night, Douglas.
- Good night, Henry.
I'm quite sure we've met before, but I can't remember where.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Julius.
Frankly, I'm quite looking forward to the new year.
Hurs on his last legs.
- It should all be over in a few months.
- Yes.
By the way, Douglas, pity about that letter to The Times.
After all, you did capture Loos, hmm?
Yes. I could have done with some more support.
Well, I mean, you can always count on mine.
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night.
- Good night, Douglas.
- Good night, Johnny.
Sir John French's carriage!
Sir John French's carriage!
That mars a terrible intriguer.
You've been loyal long enough, my dear.
Well...
Number 10 tomorrow, Dorothy.
And a Field Marshal's job for you.
Sir Douglas Haig's carriage!
Sir Douglas Haig's carriage!
Hush.
Hush.
Here comes a whizzbang.
Hush
Here comes a whizzbang
Now, you soldier men
Get down those stairs
Down in your dugouts
And say your prayers
Hush
Here comes a whizzbang
And it's making straight for you
Look out!
And you'll see all the wonders
Of no-man's-land
If a whizzbang
Hits you
Hush
- Here comes a whizzbang
- Here comes a whizzbang
Hush
- Here comes a whizzbang
- Here comes a whizzbang
Now, you soldier men
Get down those stairs
Down in your dugouts
And say your prayers
Hush
- Here comes a whizzbang
- Here comes a whizzbang
And it's making straight for you
And you'll see all the wonders
Of no-mars-land
If a whizzbang
Hits you
Come on now. Do us a Charlie Chaplin.
Come on. Let's see you do it.
And you'll see all the wonders
Of no-mars-land
If a whizzbang hits you
Gentlemen.
Germany has shot her bolt.
The prospects for 1916 are excellent.
Permission to speak, sir.
Of course.
If we continue in this way, the line of trenches will stretch from Switzerland to the sea.
Neither we nor the Germans will be able to break through.
The war will end in complete stalemate.
Nonsense.
We need only one more big offensive to break through and win.
My troops are of fine quality and especially trained for this type of war.
This is not war, sir. It is slaughter.
God is with us.
It is for King and Empire.
We are sacrificing lives at the rate of
5,000 to sometimes 50,000 a day.
Intensive bombardment, superior morale.
Just one more battle.
Sir, tell us what to do, and by God, we'll do it.
We're going to walk through the enemy lines.
Try this one, Dickie.
Cor, this is a good one, Grandpa.
Come on, Dickie, love.
They're all the same.
Come on.
Let me look at this one, please.
There's a long, long trail a-winding
Into the land of my dream
Where the nightingales are singing
And a white moon beams
There's a long, long night of waiting
Until my dreams all come true
Till the day when I'll be going...
- Name?
- Connor.
- Chellis.
- Holland.
- Littman.
- Horace.
Complete victory.
The destruction of German militarism.
Victory march on Berlin.
Slow, deliberate fire is being maintained on the enemy positions.
At this moment, my men are advancing across no-mars-land in full pack, dressing from left to right.
The men are forbidden, under pain of court-martial, to take cover in any shell hole or dugout.
Their magnificent morale will cause the enemy to flee in confusion.
The attack will be driven home with the bayonet.
I feel that every step I take is guided by the divine will.
This is most unsatisfactory.
Where are the Sherwood Foresters?
This is the latest position.
- Whisky, sir?
- Thank you.
Where are the East Lancs on the right?
Out in no-mars-land.
They're sluggish from too much sitting in the trenches.
Most of them, sir, will never rise again.
We must break through.
Regardless of loss, sir?
The loss of, say, another 300,000 men may lead to really great results...
We lost 30,000 men before lunchtime yesterday, sir.
...and will not impede our ability to continue the offensive.
In any case, we have to calculate on another great offensive next year.
If the slackers on the home front see it our way, sir.
Quite.
We are rather short of men, sir.
Oh? What's left?
The new chappies from Ireland have just arrived.
I see.
They are a wild, untrained lot.
Still, they'll be raring to have a crack at the Boche.
They've only just got off the train.
Most haven't eaten for 48 hours, sir.
They're moving against a weakened and demoralised enemy.
What they lack in training, they'll make up for in gallantry.
Capture the German line without further delay.
I think we made it.
Where are we, Sarge?
I reckon we've broken into a bit of a lull.
Yeah.
Nice, ain't it?
Aye. And peaceful.
Sniper.
I'd keep under cover if I were you.
Trouble is we've been fighting too well.
We've arrived ahead of ourselves.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's that, Sarge?
What's what?
It's somebody shouting.
Hey, look.
There's some fellow in that shell hole over there.
- Where?
- There! Do you see him?
There.
Back!
Come back!
Is it one of our boys?
Can't tell from here. Too far away.
He must have got it in the last attack.
Does he want any help then?
No. He's telling us to get the hell back out of here.
Jesus, that's easier said than done.
You can say that again.
Keep down, Seamus.
- Did you see that one?
- It came from our boys!
- Hey, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!
Now look what you've done.
You bloody idiots.
- Seamus.
- Sarge.
You're the fastest on your pins.
Nip back to HQ.
Tell the artillery to save their shells for the Jerry, and tell them to raise their bloody sights a bit.
- Back through all that lot?
- Aye, sure.
Why, it's hardly nothing at all.
- Bring us back a couple of wee girls.
- Good luck, lad!
Good luck, Seamus!
Well, somebody's got to go.
Come on. Who's next?
- I don't mind, Sarge.
- Right.
Tell them there's hundreds of us stranded up here in this ridge.
- And, Driscoll...
- Eh?
Watch it.
I'll do that.
Good luck, buddy.
If he's been shot now, I'll kill him.
He has, Sarge.
Well, I think it's best if we all stick together in the one spot.
They've started shelling for the next attack, Sarge!
Sit tight, lads.
We're out of the war now, boys.
Good morning, Mrs Howard.
Been at church today?
Well, I think we'll start.
I don't think we're going to need the umbrellas.
Now, before I talk to you,
I should like to read you a letter from George Bernard Shaw to my mother.
Aye, aye, aye.
- Does your father know?
- He says,
"The men of our country
"are being sacrificed by the blunders of boobies,
"the cupidity of capitalists,
"the ambition of conquerors,
"the lusts and lies and rancours
"of blood thirsts who love the war
"because it opens their prison doors
"and sets them on the throne of power and popularity."
Now give us a song!
For the second time, peace is being offered to the sorely tired people of the civilised world!
I don't like the title.
At the close of 1915,
President Wilson offered an immediate armistice to be followed by a peace conference.
Don't think much of the words, neither.
And in April of this year,
Germany herself proposed peace.
How do you know?
Got friends over there?
The exact terms of Germany's offer have never been made known to us, and I should like to ask Lloyd George what his war aims are.
And I should like to ask you what your old man has for dinner.
The politicians chatter like imbeciles while civilisation bleeds to death.
Now you're talking like a traitor.
Pacifists is traitors.
I ask this gentleman...
Don't ask me. I don't know nothing.
I'm stupid.
...to consider the plight of the civilised world after another year.
You do not know what you do.
And the statesmen wash their hands of the whole affair.
Why don't you wash your face?
Old Douglas Haig's got them on the run!
He's got them going!
Who tells you this?
The newspapers.
Who refuse to publish the pacifist letters, who distort the facts about our so-called victories.
We are killing off, slowly but surely, the best in the male population!
Here, don't you address them words to me!
The sons of Europe are being crucified on the barbed wire because you misguided masses are crying out for it!
- Her boy's at the front!
- My boy's at the front!
War cannot be won!
No one can win a war.
Is it your wish this war will go on and on until Germany is beaten into the ground?
Rule, Britannia Britannia rules the waves
Britons, never, never, never shall be slaves
Rule, Britannia Britannia rules the waves
Britons, never, never, never shall be slaves
I don't want to go to war
I'd rather stay at home
Around the streets to roam
And live on the earnings of a lady typist
I don't want a bayonet in me belly
I don't want me bollocks shot away
I'd rather stay in England
In merry, merry England
And fornicate me bleeding life away
Now, then, my lads, move along there.
No need to make a nuisance of yourselves.
Well, where can we go, eh?
My sister-in-law Flo's place.
Your sister-in-law Flo will talk about food rationing.
Then we go round to the boozer, and old Charlie will talk about the zeppelins.
Then we go down the street, and I'll say...
I'll say, "What shall we do?"
And you say,
"Let's go to my sister-in-law Flo's place."
And we get down there, and she'll tell us all about the food rationing.
Then we go round to the boozer for a pint, and old Charlie...
Oh, I wish I was back with the bleeding battalion!

Parade!
Parade!
Halt!
Left turn!
Put down arms!
Stand at ease!
Stand easy!
Hey, Corp!
You reinforcements?
Yeah. We're on our way up to Wipers.
Wouldrt go up there if I were you.
They've got a shortage.
What of? Ammunition?
No. Coffins.
Parade, attention!

Hello. GOC-in-C here.
Clear the line, please.
Has the 8th Division moved up on the right?
I see. Severe casualties.
No. You must reserve the artillery.
We're using too many shells.
Well, where is the 8th Division?
What?
I must have the 8th Division forward on the right.
Thank you.
"70% casualties in the last attack.
"Then there is some corner of a foreign field that is forever England."
Forward Joe Soap's army
Marching without fear
With our old commander
Safely in the rear
He boasts and skites from morn till night
And thinks he's very brave
But the men who really did the job
Are dead and in their grave
Forward Joe Soap's army
Marching without fear
With our old commander
Safely in the rear
Amen
Take up your places! Straight through!
Dearly beloved brethren.
I'm sure you will be glad to hear the news from the home front.
The Archbishop of Canterbury has made it known that it is no sin to labour for war on the Sabbath.
And I'm sure you would also like to know that the Chief Rabbi has absolved your Jewish brethren from abstaining from pork in the trenches.
Likewise, his holiness the Pope has ruled that the eating of flesh on Friday is no longer a mortal sin.
- It's high time we had an Irish pope.
- You're right.
And in faraway Tibet, the Dalai Lama has placed his prayers at the disposal of the allies.
Now, brethren, tomorrow being Good Friday, we hope God will look kindly on our attack.
We will now sing from
Hymns Ancient and Modern.
Number 358.
The Church's one foundation
We are the ragtime infantry
We cannot fight
We cannot shoot
What bleeding use are we?
And when we get to Berlin
To be his holy bride
And from his lot
What a bloody rotten lot
Are the ragtime infantry
Amen
Let us pray.
O God, show thy face to us as thou didst with thy angel at Mons.
The choir will now sing
What a Friend We Have in Jesus, as we offer a silent prayer for success in tomorrow's onslaught.
- Amen.
- Amen.
When this lousy war is over
What a friend we have in Jesus
No more soldiering for me
All our sins and griefs to bear
When I get my ciwy clothes on
What a privilege to carry
Oh, how happy I shall be
Everything to God in prayer
No more church parades on a Sunday
Oh, what peace we often forfeit
No more putting in for leave
Oh, what needless pain we bear
I shall kiss the Sergeant Major
All because we do not carry
- How I'll miss him
- All to God
- In prayer
- How he'll grieve
Amen
Well, God, the prospects for a successful attack are now ideal.
I place myself in your hands.
Land of our birth.
Land of our birth.
The fields are full of tents, O Lord, all empty as yet except for unmade and naked iron bedsteads.
Every ward has been cleared to make way for the wounded that will be arriving when the big push comes.
The doctors say there will be enormous numbers of dead and wounded, God.
I ask thee for victory, Lord, before the Americans arrive.
That we may bring, if need arise, no maimed or won'thless sacrifice.
O Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.
Parade, by squads!
Dismissed!
F squad, attention!
My troop, attention!
Whiter than the whitewash on the wall
Whiter than the whitewash on the wall
Oh, wash me in the water that you wash your dirty daughter in
And I shall be whiter than the whitewash on the wall
On the wall, on the wall
Oh, wash me in the water that you wash your dirty daughter in
And I shall be whiter than the whitewash on the wall
Quick march! Left, right, left, right!
Oh, wash me in the water that you wash your dirty daughter in
And I shall be whiter than the whitewash on the wall
On the wall, on the wall
On the wall, on the wall
O Lord, I beg you.
Do not let this dreadful war cause all the suffering that we have prepared for.
I know you will answer my prayer.
I want to go home
I want to go home
I don't want to go in the trenches no more
Where whizzbangs and shrapnel
They whistle and roar
Take me over the sea
Where the alleyman can't get at me
Oh my, I don't want to die
I want to go home
Take me over the sea
Where the alleyman can't get at me
Oh my, I don't want to die
I want to go home
I thank you, God.
The attack is a great success.
Fighting has been severe, but that was to be expected.
There has been some delay along the Menin Road, but the ground is thick with enemy dead.
First reports from the clearing stations state that our casualties are only some 60,000, mostly slight.
The wounded are very cheery indeed.
Well, that's the lot, then.
Right. Lead them off, Corporal Smith!
Right. Let's get back to the truck, lads.
Lead on this file.
Forward!
The bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling
For you but not for me
And the little devils how they sing-a-ling-a-ling
For you but not for me
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling-a-ling
Oh grave, thy victory?
The bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling

The bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling
For you but not for me
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Sir, I've been wondering...
Or rather, the staff and I have been wondering, perhaps this policy of attrition might be a mistake.
After all, it's wearing us down more than it is them.
Couldrt we increase our efforts on other fronts?
Nonsense. The Western Front is the only real front.
We must grind them down.
You see, our population is greater than theirs, and their losses are greater than ours.
I don't quite follow that, sir.
In the end, they will have 5,000 men left and we shall have 10,000, and we shall have won.
In any case,
I intend to launch one more full-scale offensive.
And we shall break through and win.
Rum ration.
Old soldiers never die
The young ones wish they would
Those poor bastards still moaning out in no-mars-land.
Somebody ought to do something about it.
It's terrible, terrible.
Sounds like a bleeding cattle market.
Right. Wakey-wakey. On your feet.
The order's come through for the attack.
We kick off at 5:00 ack-emma.
Right! Move!
That's a bloody fine time, isn't it?
If the sergeant steals your rum Never mind
If the sergeant steals your rum Never mind
Though he's just a bloody sod
Let him take the bleeding lot
If the sergeant steals your rum Never mind
Never mind
If old Jerry shells the trench Never mind
If old Jerry shells the trench Never mind
Though the blasted sandbags fly
You have only once to die
If old Jerry shells the trench Never mind
Never mind
Right. Come on, lads. Come on.
If you get stuck on the wire
- Never mind
- Never mind
If you get stuck on the wire
- Never mind
- Never mind
Though the light's as broad as day
When you die they stop your pay
If you get stuck on the wire
Never mind
Oh, never mind
Far far from Wipers, I long to be
Where German snipers can't get at me
Damp is my dugout, cold are my feet
Waiting for whizzbangs to send me to sleep
Sir! 5:00 ack-emma, sir.
- Press the attack immediately.
- Sir.
If you want the old battalion
We know where they are
We know where they are
We know where they are
If you want the old battalion
We know where they are
They're hanging on the old barbed wire
We've seen them, we've seen them
Hanging on the old barbed wire
We've seen them, we've seen them
Hanging on the old barbed wire
We've seen them, we've seen them
Hanging on the old barbed wire
We've seen them, we've seen them
Hanging on the old barbed wire
We've seen them
Hanging on the old barbed wire
Right! Over the top, boys!
Come on, now, fast as you can!
Come on, lads.
'Our counteroffensive commenced this morning.
'Satisfactory progress.
'Yesterday, the King inspected the troops.
'Trouble was
'that the men waved their hats instead of flags
'as His Majesty rode by.
'The King did clutch the reins too firmly... '
Correction.
The King did clutch the reins rather firmly, no reflection on
His Majesty's horsemanship.
The grass was very slippery, and the mare moved backwards.
I'd exercised her every day for a year.
So unfortunate it had to be my horse that threw the King.
They've all gone.
They've all been killed.
No, they haven't.
They're just under cover.
- Where are you going?
- Forward.
It's no use staying here.
You've got to keep moving forward.
Look, as soon as the next shell bursts in front of us,
- you follow me into the hole. Right?
- Right.
Why don't our gunners do something about that bleeding machine gun?
They are doing something.
They just haven't hit him yet.
Let's have a try with one of these.
I'd like to catch that bleeder who threw that bleeding smoke bomb.
I can't see a bleeding thing.
Far far from Wipers, I long to be
Where German snipers can't get at me
This is the life, eh, Sarge?
Damp is my dugout, cold are my feet
Waiting for whizzbangs to send me to sleep
I must have drawn you in a sweep.
- I've had enough of this.
- Yeah, me and all.
Let's get that bleeding machine gun.
- They're just as scared as we are.
- All right.
Where do you reckon you're going?
Just to have a crack at that gun, Sarge.
All right. Careful, now.
- I'll give you covering fire.
- Right.
- See you after the war, Sarge.
- Yeah, at your sister-in-law Flo's place.
- About 8:00.
- Make it half-past.
- What?
- I might be a bit late!
Right.
Right.
You can close the battle of the Somme now.
The final British losses are 607,784 officers and men.
- And the French losses, sir?
- They are still to come.
And ground gained, nil.
'Thank you for the copy of The Times.
'I'm glad that in spite of all, it is still a victory.
'lt does not seem so here.
'lt is beyond belief, the butchery.
'The men look so appalling when they are brought in,
'and so many die.'
They were summoned from the hillside
They were called in from the glen
And the country found them ready
At the stirring call for men
Let no tears add to their hardship
As the soldiers pass along
And although your heart is breaking
Make it sing this cheery song
Keep the home fires burning
While your hearts are yearning
Though the lads are far away
They dream of home
There's a silver lining
Through the dark clouds shining
Turn the dark cloud inside out
Till the boys come home
Come along, Harry, lad.
Have to move you onto the ground now.
Need the stretcher, see?
There's a casualty list up.
I wonder who's on it.
Excuse me, love.
Hey, there's another Arkwright again.
Oh, I never did.
Hey, Milly, another Arkwright gone.
Yeah. I know her.
- That's three she's lost.
- No, four.
No, three.
They're bringing them back at night now.
What is it?
It's just another list, Flo.
- Ethel's boy's just been let out of prison.
- Why?
- There's another big push coming.
- Oh, never.
Ask Flo. She's in munitions.
They're always first to know.
Is that true, then?
It's true. It's starting again.
Don't worry, love, your Jack will be all right.
- Can't go on much longer now, can it?
- Of course not.
Must be rotten for you working down there.
- It's not bad.
- I wouldn't like it, all those men.
Our old foremars bad enough.
One girl earned £3 last week with overtime.
- Go on.
- It's true.
They're paying a fortune.
They need to, after that explosion last week.
Never found nothing of them, did they?
We're going on overtime next week.
What you making?
Big new order's coming.
It's funny stuff, they say it's for shrouds.
- Oh, it makes you shiver.
- Milly.
What's that?
It's the Yankees!
Come on.
Over there
Over there.
- Our infantry...
- Have the reserves been...
The Yanks are coming The Yanks are coming
The drums rum-tumming everywhere
So prepare, say a prayer
Send the word, send the word to beware
We'll be over, we're coming over
And we won't come back
We'll be buried over there
Hello, Ben.
- Who's that, then?
- Smithey. Jack Smith.
Hello, Jack.
- One of Jerry's, eh?
- Yeah.
Must have thought they were staying.
- How are you, mate? All right?
- Fine.
Good to see you.
- What's it like outside?
- They're still strafing.
I'm bloody sick of it.
Do you know where we are?
Mons.
First big battle of the war.
We're right back where we started.
Look at that.
Wouldrt catch me eating it.
My brother Harry, he was at Mons.
They're bloody starving in Germany, you know?
We both were.
I heard the Germans is going Bolshevik.
That's when he got wounded. First time.
They say the German Navy's mutinied.
There's going to be a revolution.
They're just like the Russians.
Right, on your feet. Outside, you lot!
Then he came back again.
Corporal Tanner, he's read this bloke Lenin.
He reckons it's all going to be different.
Well, it's got to be, isn't it?
It stands to reason.
They say the war will end anytime now.
Get your mask on, or you won't live to see it.
Halt!
Right. Come on.
Who the hell are you, then, the unknown soldier?
No, sir, I'm 294, Smith, J.
You'll have to move some. It's 10:58.
You're the last one.
Come on, lad, just follow the tape.
Granny.
Granny, what did Daddy do in the war?
And when they ask us
How dangerous it was
Oh, we'll never tell them
No, we'll never tell them
We spent our pay in some café
And fought wild women night and day
'Twas the cushiest job we ever had
And when they ask us
And they're certainly going to ask us
The reason why we didn't win
The Croix de Guerre
Oh, we'll never tell them
No, we'll never tell them
There was a front
But damned if we knew where
And they're certainly going to ask us
The reason why we didn't win
The Croix de Guerre
Oh, we'll never tell them
No, we'll never tell them
There was a front
But damned if we knew where
On mark 8 and closing.
- Steady as she goes.
- Engineering to Bridge.
Phaser crew, stand by.
Range, 45,000 kilometres, captain.
Fascinating.
Range, 43,000 kilometres and closing.
Sensor readings.
A mechanical device of unknown properties.
I read no life forms aboard.
- Analysis, science officer.
- Obviously it intends to intercept us.
It has made several course changes corresponding with our own.
Thirty-eight thousand and closing.
Thirty-five thousand and closing.
Unclear whether it intends to attack or merely communicate with us.
Thank you, science officer.
- Come to 181, mark 7.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- It's staying with us.
- Indeed.
Full stop, Mr. Chekov.
Hold your position.
Aye, sir.
Aliens.
You have encroached on the space of the Melkot.
You will turn back immediately.
This is the only warning you will receive.
- Vulcan, captain.
- English.
- It was Russian, sir. Every word.
- No, captain, it was Swahili.
Interesting. Telepathy.
Unquestionably. Most impressive.
Our orders are very clear.
We're to establish contact with the Melkotians at all costs.
True telepaths can be most formidable, captain, and we have been warned.
What previous contacts have been made with the Melkotians?
No recorded contacts.
If they ever ventured into space, they evidently withdrew immediately.
Lieutenant, hailing frequencies.
Tied in, sir.
This is Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets.
We have contacted your buoy and understand its message.
We hope that you will understand that our intent is to establish peaceful relations with you.
- Lieutenant, answer?
- Nothing, sir. Clear on all frequencies.
Try again.
Still no response, sir.
Opinion, Mr. Spock?
I prefer being a welcome guest, captain, but there seems to be little choice.
None whatsoever.
Mr. Chekov, deflectors to full intensity.
Increase speed to achieve planet fall as scheduled.
Aye, sir.
Standard orbit in five minutes.
Lieutenant Uhura, advise Dr. McCoy and Engineer Scott to meet me in the Transporter Room.
Mr. Spock, Mr. Chekov, let's go find out what it is they're afraid of.
Captain's log, stardate 4385.3.
We have transported down to the Melkotian planet and have encountered conditions which are completely contrary to what we were prepared for.
- Spock, what is this?
- Unknown, captain.
Sensor readings give no indication of fog-like conditions in this area.
I knew it had to happen.
It's a fine time for that transporter mechanism to break down.
Impossible, Dr. McCoy.
My transporter was working perfectly.
- Then what are we doing here?
- Tricorder readings, Mr. Spock?
Unknown, captain.
Unlike Mr. Scott's transporter, this unit is not functioning.
Then let's get out of here.
Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise.
Come in.
No use, captain. Obviously, none of our devices will function.
Apparently that Melkotian buoy...
Aliens.
Space, the final frontier.
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.
Our warning was plain.
You have disregarded it.
You shall be punished.
You, Captain Kirk.
The disobedience was on your orders.
Yours is the responsibility.
Yours shall be the pattern of your death.
We come in peace.
But we'll defend ourselves if necessary.
You are outside. You are disease.
The disease must be destroyed.
Your plea has been heard, and sentence has been pronounced.
It is done.
Fascinating.
Where are we now, captain?
Spock, evaluation.
Obviously, this represents the Melkotians' concept of an American frontier town, circa 1880.
It's just bits and pieces.
It's incomplete.
Perhaps the Melkotians have insufficient data about this era.
Or perhaps this is all they require to complete the pattern of our death.
And these, captain?
- Beautiful specimen.
- Crude, but dangerous.
Whatever the Melkotians have planned for us, it won't be pleasant.
These could be useful.
Just remember one thing.
To individuals at close range, these could be as deadly as phasers.
In the midst of what seems so unreal, a harsh reality.
This is not a dream.
"October 26th, eighteen-eighty... 1881.
Tombstone, Arizona."
Tombstone.
Hell-for-leather, right out of history.
But why here?
And why now?
Captain, the Melkot said you were the pattern.
He looked into your mind and selected what he considered the proper time and place for our punishment.
Because my ancestors pioneered the American frontier.
Yes. The violence of your own heritage is to be the pattern for our execution.
What's the matter with us?
We're talking like we really are in Tombstone, Arizona in 1881.
Precisely, in terms of what the Melkots intend for us.
There's something about that date.
October 26th, 1881.
But what was it?
Lke.
Ike. Frank, Billy, Tom.
Ike, I was afraid you weren't gonna make it.
Looks like we did.
Well, I knew you wouldn't let them scare you away.
They're a bunch of hot air, if you ask me.
- Are they really?
- And now they're gonna have to fight after the way they shot off their mouths.
Do you know us?
Funny. That's what I like about you, lke.
- You always see the funny side.
- Yes, I'm a barrel of laughs.
Well, nobody can say Johnny Behan doesn't have a sense of humour.
Johnny?
He called me lke, you Frank,
Bones Tom.
And Billy.
Ike Clanton,
Tom and Frank McLaury,
Billy Claiborne, Billy Clanton.
Captain, I pride myself on my knowledge of your Earth history.
The names were known in the annals of the opening of the western sector of America.
The United States of America, that is.
In the late 19th century in Arizona, two factions fought for control of the town of Tombstone.
The Earps: Morgan, Virgil and Wyatt, who were the town marshals, along with Doc Holliday.
And the Clanton gang.
On October 26th, they had it out.
Who won?
The Clantons lost, Mr. Chekov.
And we are the Clantons.
We are the Clantons.
And if this is a replay of history...
History cannot be changed.
It's impossible.
Things like this can't happen.
Is this a dead man, doctor?
Very dead, Mr. Spock.
That's one thing we can be sure of here.
Death is real.
Ike, Frank. How are you, boys?
I didn't think I'd see you again.
Billy.
Oh, Billy.
Billy, baby, I knew they couldn't keep you out of town.
- Oh, you knew that?
- Come on.
Maybe you shouldn't have.
And pass up an opportunity to see you? Don't be silly.
It's taking crazy chances with
Morgan Earp right in the same room.
Yes, of course.
The man who kills on sight.
Morgan Earp.
Captain, since we have seen that death is the one reality in this situation,
I seriously suggest you reseat yourself immediately.
Without moving a muscle of either hand.
If I remember correctly, that would involve you in what was called the fast draw.
It initiated unfortunate events.
You boys want your usual?
Absolutely, a half a gallon of Scotch.
You know we ain't got nothing but bourbon.
Unless you want corn whisky.
I wish it was all over.
Ike, I saw Virgil out patrolling this morning.
Good old Virgil.
We can always count on him.
They've been blowing off all over town how they chased the Clantons out.
I guess you'll show them now, won't you?
I don't think we're gonna have any choice.
You'll dirty yourself with this scum.
Come on.
- Get your hands off her.
- Now, Claiborne...
Now, now, all right, all right, all right.
Now, we don't want any trouble.
If you don't want trouble, what are you doing in my town?
Just leave us alone, Mr. Earp.
That's all we ask.
Five of you. You'd like me to draw, wouldn't you? All right, I will.
Soon enough.
Soon enough.
I believe he was actually trying to provoke a dispute with Mr. Chekov.
Close, lke.
Lucky there wasn't two of them.
I guess so.
Sylvia's right.
They've been badmouthing something fierce all over town.
- You boys watch it.
- I assure you, sir, we shall watch it.
And everything, extremely closely.
Billy, you were wonderful.
Mr. Chekov.
What can I do, captain?
You know we're always supposed to maintain good relations with the natives.
Young lady.
- Young lady.
- Yes, lke?
I'd like to talk to Mr...
To Billy alone if you don't mind.
All right. I understand.
Billy Claiborne, you be careful.
Mr. Chekov, you be careful.
Mr. Spock, except for our handguns, we haven't changed.
Not even our clothing, yet these people see and hear us as the Clantons.
I don't think that's such a bad thing, captain.
- The day is still young, ensign.
- All right, what have we got?
We're here in Tombstone, Arizona,
October 26th, 1881.
The day of the gunfight at O.K. Corral.
And we're the Clantons.
And Morgan Earp has just gone off to tell his brothers that we're here.
And if this is indeed some sort of a replay of history, the Earps will kill the Clantons at the O.K. Corral at 5:00 this afternoon.
Well, we're not going to be at the
O.K. Corral at 5:00 this afternoon.
You, bartender, Ed.
You claim you know us.
I ain't making no big claims about nobody. Just so happens.
Take a close look at me.
- Yeah?
- Who do you think I am?
Lke Clanton.
Who do you think you are?
Well, I know this is hard to understand, but I'm Captain James T. Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise.
These men are part of my crew.
We're not really here.
We're from the future.
We haven't been born yet.
Feel the material in my shirt.
Now feel the material in your own shirt.
Do you notice any difference?
Nope.
- Do these clothes look like yours?
- Not exactly.
Have you ever seen clothes like this before?
- Sure.
- Where?
On the Clantons.
You Clantons are always great with your jokes. That's why we like you.
I'm not joking.
Only difference between you and the Earps is that they never joke.
I'm not joking. I'm not lke Clanton.
It's okay with me, lke.
Anything you say.
Don't make no difference who I think you are.
Your problem is, who does Wyatt Earp think you are?
Good morning, gentlemen.
My name is James Kirk, and I'm afraid there's been some sort of misunderstanding.
Clanton, I don't know what you're trying to pull, but we warned you not to show your ugly face in town again.
Of course, and I wanted to talk about that.
We're done talking, Clanton.
There's been some sort of mistake, a misunderstanding. L...
All right, Clanton.
One more chance, your last.
You've got until 5 tonight to get your horse-stealing, scurvy crew out of town.
All the way.
Yes, we'd be glad to.
We don't want to fight.
I always said you was yellow.
I'll make one more attempt to get through to you, Mr. Earp.
My name is not Clanton. It's Kirk.
Oh, yeah.
We heard the talk about your jokes.
I'm not joking.
Sure. Well, I'm glad to meet you,
Mr. Kirk.
- Draw, Clanton.
- Not me, Mr. Earp.
- You draw or I will.
- No, Wyatt.
Let me.
When the time comes,
I'll pay him for this.
We don't want any trouble.
We'd be glad to cooperate.
Five o'clock, Clanton. Is that clear?
If you're in town at 5:01, we'll kill every one of you whether you draw or not.
Is that clear?
- What's the matter?
- What do you call that stuff, fire?
"Taos Lightning straight bourbon."
Try some. In small amounts, it was considered medicinal.
They ought to label it
"For external use only."
It just takes a bit of getting used to, captain.
Actually, a man could grow quite fond of this stuff.
Take it easy, Mr. Scott.
I hate to think what that's doing to your stomach.
And your reflexes.
We're gonna need fast reflexes from now on.
There's no negotiating with the Earps.
We know that.
Aye. If we only had a phaser.
Or a communicator.
It'd be a pleasure to watch those Earps as we beamed back to the ship at exactly 4:59:30.
- Could we make a communicator?
- Impossible, captain.
In this century, there are no metal alloys or power sources to make devices such as ours.
Problem is clear, Spock. We're gonna have to seek contemporary solutions.
- Where's Chekov?
- Mr. Chekov is involved, captain.
You shouldn't have come back to town, Billy.
Morgan will kill you because he wants me.
With his outdated weapon?
If he shoots at me,
I will just step out of the way.
You can joke about it.
I've seen him in action.
Especially Morgan.
A lot of people and things have tried to kill me.
You'd be surprised.
Mr. Chekov... I mean, Billy.
Come along.
Yes, sir.
Billy.
Please, don't even go near him.
Gentlemen.
- Where are we going, captain?
- To exercise the better part of valour.
Well, that settles that. A force field.
It is obvious the Melkotians are not going to permit us to leave this town.
If we could only contact the Enterprise.
Yes, but where is the Enterprise?
Mr. Chekov, if you were in charge of the Enterprise, what would you be doing?
I'd be using the ship's sensors, trying to locate us.
Very good. If we could find the place where we beamed down, the ship might lock in and beam us up.
- Well, let's get there.
- There's no way we can know where it is, doctor.
It could be anywhere within a thousand-mile radius.
Mr. Spock, why don't you join us common humanoids in trying to find a way out of here and quit explaining why we can't get out.
We have until 5:00 to find that way.
Now, consider this.
What materials were on hand in 1881 that could help us fight the Earps on their own terms?
- We have these, captain.
- No, the Melkots gave us those to execute us.
We have to find a way to put the Earps out of action.
Is there anything that exists here and now that could help us out of this trap?
All those Western Cossacks had were poisonous snakes and cactus plants.
Bones, the venom, the plants.
Can you make use of them?
A tranquilliser. Of course, Jim,
I can make a tranquilliser.
I could make a device to deliver it on target.
First, Bones, the ingredients you require.
I know the place to get the proper drugs.
- I'll need a mortar and a pestle.
- Chekov, mortar and pestle.
How do you intend to deliver the tranquilliser on target?
I shall need some fusing and some cotton wadding.
- Cotton wadding, try the apothecary.
- Aye.
I shall manufacture the equivalent of an ancient generating canister, more familiarly known as a gas grenade.
I'll be about five minutes yet.
You could come back.
Well, thank you.
Mind if I look around a bit?
Crude, but very useable.
I wouldn't touch that stuff if I was you.
Oh, you don't have to worry.
I know how to handle this.
I have an urgent need for a small supply of this drug too.
That stuff ain't mine. It belongs to him.
You'd better ask him.
Oh, so you're the dentist?
Well, I'm a physician, and I have a serious emergency.
I wonder if you mind if I'd borrow a small quantity of this.
- You want it now?
- My name is McCoy. I'm a doctor.
That joke is all around town already,
McLaury.
Well, my name is still Holliday.
Doc Holliday.
The emergency is real.
I need these things.
Your emergency sure is real.
Go on, take the stuff.
Have some more fun.
Take my bag.
Only best you be finished before 5:00.
That is my intention, doctor.
Because at one minute past 5, you'll find a hole in your head.
Right from this gun.
Sylvia.
Hello.
Billy Claiborne, do you know how crazy I am about you?
That's very nice.
Well, aren't you gonna ask me what I've got in my shopping bag?
That's just what
I was preparing to enquire.
Have you been shopping?
Of course, silly.
What else would I be doing on a beautiful afternoon with the dance only one week away?
- Or have you forgotten that already?
- No, no, I haven't forgotten.
I am looking forward to it most eagerly.
You will be absolutely wild when you see me in the new gown I'm going to make.
I found this most scrumptious material.
Yards and yards of it.
You know what I was thinking, Billy?
I was thinking what a beautiful wedding gown it would make.
Why don't we just turn that dance into a wedding ball?
It would be so heavenly.
Married?
I am afraid that wouldn't be possible.
But I'm positive the gown will be ready.
And what else is there to stop a wedding?
But it is absolutely impossible.
I am not someone you can marry.
If only I could make clear to you what I really am.
Do you think I don't know?
Billy Claiborne, you are a cattle rustler and a horse thief.
And I don't care what else.
I warned you, Claiborne. Stay away.
You don't have to take anything from that scum. Not while I'm here.
Mr. Earp.
Get your hands off her.
There's nothing I can do, Jim.
Come on, Clanton. Let's do it now.
- Captain, let me.
- No.
Yeah, come on, captain. Let him.
Captain, we can't just stand here and take it.
- Yes, we can.
- But they murdered Chekov.
- If you think I'm going to...
- Scotty.
They're trying to push us into something we're not ready for.
And it is not yet our time.
Let it go, Jim. He's dead.
Maybe he wouldn't be if I hadn't ignored the Melkot warning.
We all knew the risk when we joined the service.
Now, let it go.
Gentlemen, there is one thing which requires the immediate attention of all of us.
Specifically, our future.
But not this minute, Spock.
It takes us a little longer.
I understand the feeling, captain.
You talk about another man's feelings.
What do you feel, Spock?
My feelings are not subject for discussion, doctor.
Because there are no feelings to discuss.
Mr. Spock, Chekov is dead.
I say it now, and I can hardly believe it.
But you worked closely with him.
That deserves some memorial.
Spock will have no truck with grief,
Scotty. It's human.
- Bones, Scotty.
- Captain, it's quite all right.
They forget I am half human.
We don't have much time.
Captain, I vaguely remember the historical account of the famous battle in which we are about to engage, but I am confused.
About what?
Since each of us represents members of the Clanton gang...
You, lke Clanton, I, Frank McLaury.
- Then Mr. Chekov would be the other Billy, would he not?
William Claiborne, that's right.
But did not William Claiborne survive the battle at the O.K. Corral?
Get to the point, Spock.
Mr. Chekov is dead, but in the actual gunfight,
William Claiborne survived.
Yes. Yes, that's right.
That means it doesn't have to happen the way it happened.
We can change it.
Bones, how's the tranquilliser coming?
- I'll have it ready before Spock.
- Spock?
Another hour.
And we'll have a tranquilliser grenade?
- Not precisely.
- Forget precision. Will it work?
It should.
Make sure it does, Spock.
If we don't tranquillise them, we'll have to fight them.
And if we fight them, we all die.
We know that.
Negotiating with them could buy us more time, captain.
But not with the Earps.
I've tried that. That's out.
There must be a way.
History has been changed in the fact that Billy Claiborne didn't die, but Chekov is lying there dead.
That means there must be a way to change this time in history.
It would be worth a try, at least until we're certain of the device.
Then perhaps we could quiet things down.
Not with the Earps.
There is one other place I can try.
You looking for somebody?
Yes, sheriff.
- I want you to stop the fight.
- Stop it?
Who wants to stop it?
I sure don't. You don't.
- You didn't yesterday.
- I do now.
Since when does a Clanton run crawling to the law for help?
- How else is he gonna get justice?
- From this.
You and your boys set up this whole thing to take care of the Earps.
It's a little late to decide you don't have the belly for it.
It's not too late.
Sheriff. Sheriff.
There must be decent people in town who don't like the Earps.
- Let's organise them.
- Don't talk nonsense.
The people in this town are counting on you to get rid of the Earps for them.
Then the people better wake up and let the law work for them.
You can talk that way after what the Earps did to Billy today?
Nobody in this town will deny you your right to your revenge.
Yes, I want revenge.
I want to crush the life out of the Earps.
- But I can't just kill them.
- You listen to me.
Get down to the O.K. Corral, keep out of sight.
When the Earps come looking, you bushwhack them.
Can't I get it through your head?
I can't just kill them.
- I can't just kill them!
- It's the only way!
- I can't murder them! I can't kill them!
- Kill them any way you can!
There'll be no questions asked.
Honest.
I guarantee that.
These crude supplies we were forced to use worked quite well.
I doubt that this combination of things was ever used for any purpose quite like this.
Perhaps they would have been if they'd had your ingenuity, doctor.
Captain?
- How soon will that be ready?
- Right now.
Good. How long will it take the tranquilliser to have effect?
- Three or four seconds.
- How did you manage to test it?
It has not been tested.
It's not necessary, captain.
It's very simple. Nothing can go wrong.
Up to now, everything has gone wrong.
I want it tested now.
Would a volunteer solve the problem?
- It would.
- All right. On one condition.
That I'm wide awake and with you at 5:00.
- Guaranteed.
- All right.
It's to kill the pain.
But this is painless.
Well, you should have warned me sooner, Mr. Spock.
Fire away.
It should have worked.
Did you inhale the gas, Scotty?
Aye, deeply.
- You still feel all right?
- Never felt better.
No dizziness, no sweating, no palpitations?
It doesn't work.
Indeed, fascinating.
It was our last chance.
Captain, you don't seem to understand.
It did not function, but it must function.
Nothing could go wrong, captain.
It should work.
A scientific fact.
But if the tranquilliser does not function, which is clearly impossible, then a radical alteration of our thought patterns must be in order.
We need a weapon.
An answer.
Don't have to worry about that now,
Jim.
Look at the clock.
Ten minutes.
And it's all gonna end at the O.K. Corral.
Well, we're gonna wait right here until well after 5:00.
We're not gonna move from this spot.
Let's get out of here.
Scotty, Bones.
We're trapped.
They got their way.
We better stand and fight.
Good. If they want a fight, let's give them a fight.
They're experts at gunfighting.
We won't have a chance.
Well, then we'd better become experts, and fast.
That may not be necessary.
- Spock, you've got something?
- A fact, captain.
Physical laws simply cannot be ignored.
Existence cannot be without them.
What do you mean, Spock?
I mean, doctor, that we are faced with a staggering contradiction.
The tranquilliser you created should have been effective.
It would have been effective anywhere else.
Exactly.
Doctor, in your opinion, what killed Mr. Chekov?
A piece of lead in his body.
Wrong. His mind killed him.
Well, come on, Spock.
If you've got the answer, tell us.
Physical reality is consistent with universal laws.
Where the laws do not operate, there is no reality.
All of this is unreal.
What do you mean, unreal?
I examined Chekov. He's dead.
But you made your examination under conditions which we cannot trust.
We judge reality by the response of our senses.
Once we are convinced of the reality of a given situation, we abide by its rules.
We judge the bullets to be solid, the guns to be real.
Therefore, they can kill.
Chekov is dead because he believed the bullets would kill him.
He may indeed be dead.
We do not know.
But we do know that the Melkotians created the situation.
If we do not allow ourselves to believe that the bullets are real, they cannot kill us.
Exactly. I know the bullets are unreal, therefore they cannot harm me.
We must all be as certain as you are,
Mr. Spock,
- if we're to save our lives.
- Precisely.
But that's not possible.
There'd always be some doubt.
The smallest doubt would be enough to kill you.
We're just human beings, Spock.
We don't have that clockwork ticker in our heads like you do.
- We can't just turn it on and off.
- We must.
Spock, a Vulcan mind-meld.
Very well, sir. Engineer?
Your mind to my mind.
Your thoughts to my thoughts.
The bullets are unreal.
Without body.
They are illusions only.
Shadows without substance.
They will not pass through your body, for they do not exist.
They do not exist.
Unreal.
Appearances only.
They are shadows, illusions.
Nothing but ghosts of reality.
They are lies, falsehoods.
Specters without body.
They are to be ignored.
Captain.
Draw.
Captain, I don't understand.
Neither do I. He's in perfect health.
What happened?
Where have I been?
Right here, it seems.
But that girl, she was so beautiful.
So real.
Do you remember anything else?
- No.
- Good.
Perhaps that explains why he's here.
Nothing was real to him except the girl.
Captain, the Melkotian object.
Sensor readings.
The object is beginning to emit M-rays of a highly unstable nature, captain.
Lieutenant, sound red alert.
Mr. Chekov, deflector shields on full.
- Deflectors on full, sir.
- Gun crews, lock on target.
Energy output increasing beyond measurable levels, captain.
Phaser guns, stand by to fire.
It's gone, sir.
Damage report, lieutenant.
No damage, sir.
All decks report fully operational.
Captain Kirk.
You did not kill.
- Is this the way of your kind?
- It is.
We fight only when there's no choice.
We prefer the ways of peaceful contact.
I speak for a vast alliance of fellow creatures who believe in the same thing.
We have sought you out to join us.
Our mission is still one of peace.
Approach our planet and be welcome.
A delegation will come out to meet you.
Our warning threats are over.
Excellent.
Lieutenant, cancel red alert.
Mr. Chekov, resume original course, warp factor 2.
Warp factor 2, sir.
Captain, may I ask a question?
You needn't answer if it seems too personal.
I'm sure I'll be able to give you an answer, Mr. Spock.
This afternoon, you wanted to kill, didn't you?
But he didn't kill, Mr. Spock.
But he wanted to, doctor.
Is that the way it seemed to you,
Mr. Spock?
Yes, captain.
Mr. Spock, you're absolutely right.
That's exactly the way it was.
Mankind, ready to kill.
That's the way it was in 1881.
I wonder how humanity managed to survive.
We overcame our instinct for violence.
"Is it worth the waiting for if we live till 84?

- How much did you say?
- Only three guineas, Mr. Sowerberry.
- A bargain, if ever there was one.
- I was looking for a boy.
All right, bring him in, Mr. Bumble.
My love, I said we might consider taking this boy...
...to help in the shop.
Dear me. He’s very small.
He is rather small, there’s no denying, but he'll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry.
I dare say he will.
On our bittles and our drink!
These workhouse boys always cost more than they’re worth.
- Where did he come from?
- Mother came to us destitute.
She gave birth to him and promptly died, leaving no forwarding name or address.
Here he is, yours for three guineas.
Cash on delivery.
No, cash upon liking. A week on approval.
If he works hard on a little food, then we’ll keep him.
He can help put the shutters up.
Do you hear, now?
- Then he can clean around the house.
- I'll look after him, missus.
My dear, it occurred to me, he’ll make a delightful coffin-follower.
That expression of melancholy.
Interesting, don’t you think so, my love?
I don’t mean a regular coffin-follower to attend grown-up people, no...
...just at children’s funerals.
A mute in proportion, so to speak?
Precisely. A superb effect, don’t you think?
Do you think you could look like that gentlemen up there?
Perhaps, if I had a tall hat.
Look, it’s Oliver!
- Noah, come on.
- No.
How’s your mother, workhouse?
You leave my mother out of it. She’s dead.
What did she die of? Shortage of breath?
You’d better not say anything about her to me.
Don’t be cheeky, workhouse.
Your mother, she was a nice one, a regular right-down bad one.
What did you say?
It’s a good thing she died when she did
"cause she’d be in prison doing hard labour.
Help!
Get away! Get away from him!
What’s going on down here?
What are you trying to do, wake the dead?
It’s you! Get out of here!
He started it!
Come here, you!
- Quick!
- Hurry up.
Oh, dear!
I'm going off. Water!
Noah, run over to the workhouse.
Get Mr. Bumble. Tell him to come quick.
Where is he? Where is the young rascal?
- Oliver?
- Yes, I'm here.
- Do you know this voice?
- Yes, I do.
Ain't you afraid of it?
Ain’t you trembling when I speak?
No, l’m not!
- He’s gone mad to speak to you like that.
- It’s not madness, it’s meat.
- Meat?
- Meat, ma'am! You overfed the boy.
You raised an artificial spirit in the lad unbecoming to his station in life.
This wouldn’t have happened if you’d fed him gruel. l’d be glad to give you the recipe.
- Having a rest, Mr. Bumble?
- He’s sitting on Oliver.
- Quite right. We must all sit on Oliver.
- You’ve been drinking again?
- I met a friend in the cemetery.
- Help!
Who’s in there?
That coffin should not have been occupied until tomorrow.
It’s reserved for a very important client.
Stand back!
- What’s your explanation, you scallywag?
- He called my mom a name.
And what if he did, you ungrateful wretch?
She deserved what he said and worse.
- She didn’t!
- She did!
It’s a lie.
- Hold your tongue, boy.
- Put him down in the cellar.
It’s really quite comfortable.
Stay there till we decide what to do with you.
Here’s your baggage, workhouse.
Three pounds, indeed!
You can take him back.

No, never. I’m sorry. I didn’t...

- Yes, I am. I’ve come a long way. l’ve been walking for seven days.
- Been running away from the beak?
- The what?
Don’t say you don’t know what a "beak" is?
It’s a bird’s mouth, isn’t it?
My eyes, how green can you get!
For your information, a beak is a magistrate.
- Who you running from, your old man?
- No, l’m an orphan. l’ve come to London to make my fortune.

Got any lodgings?
- Money?
- Not a farthing.

I suppose you want someplace to sleep tonight.
Do you know of anywhere?
I know a respectable old gentleman who'll give you lodgings for nothing.
And never ask for the change, if a gentleman he knows introduces you.
Don’t you know me?
He must be a very kind old gentlemen.
Yes, he’s very kind.
And l’m a particular favourite of his.
Now, if you’re coming along, l’d better know who you are.
My name’s Oliver Twist.
And mine’s Jack Dawkins.
Better known as the Artful Dodger.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dodger.

It’s Dodger! Coming up.
Dodger.
Oliver!
Up you go.
- Not again.
- Get out.
Fagin, I brought my new friend to see you.
Oliver Twist.
Sir.
I hope I shall have the honour of your intimate acquaintance.
We’re glad to see you, Oliver.
Aren’t we, my dears?
Yes, Fagin!
Give me back my things. Leave it!
Leave him alone!
Take off the sausages.
Lay a place at the table for Mr. Twist.
Dodger tells me you’ve come to London to seek your fortune.
Yes, sir.
We must see what we can do to help you, mustn’t we?
- Thank you.
- These sausages are mouldy!
Shut up and drink your gin!
You’re staring at the pocket handkerchiefs, my dear?
We just hung them up ready for the wash, that’s all.
- Is this a laundry then, sir?
- Yeah, a laundry!
Not exactly. A laundry would be a very nice thing indeed.
But our line of business pays a little better.
Don’t it, boys?
You see, Oliver...
"In this life, one thing counts:
In the bank, large amounts!
"l’m afraid these don’t grow on trees
You’ve got to pick a pocket or two
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two, boys
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two
"Large amounts don’t grow on trees
You’ve got to pick a pocket or two"
Let’s show Oliver how to do it, my dears.
Just a game, Oliver, just a game.
"Why should we break our backs
Stupidly paying tax?
"Better get some untaxed income:
Better pick a pocket or two
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two, boys
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two
"Why should we all break our backs?
"Better pick a pocket or two
"Robin Hood, what a crook:
Gave away what he took
"Charity’s fine, subscribe to mine
Get out and pick a pocket or two
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two, boys
"Robin Hood was far too good
"Get out and pick a pocket or two
"Take a tip from Bill Sikes:
He can whip what he likes
"I recall, he started small
He had to pick a pocket or two
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two, boys
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two
"We could be like old Bill Sikes
If we pick a pocket or two
"Dear old gent passing by
Something nice takes his eye
"Everything’s clear, attack the rear!
Get in and pick a pocket or two
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two, boys
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two
"Have no fear, attack the rear
Get in and pick a pocket or two
"When I see someone rich
Both my thumbs start to itch
"Only to find some peace of mind
I have to pick a pocket or two
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two, boys
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two
"Just to find some peace of mind
"We have to pick a pocket or two!"
Put them all back in the box.
All of them.
Come here!
Good boy. What a crook!
We’ve all been hard at work today, haven’t we, my dears?
What have you got, Dodger?
- A couple wallets.
- Lined?
Only the best.
Not as heavy as they might be.
But, very nicely made.
- Ingenious workman, ain't he?
- Does he make these himself?
- With his own lily-white hands.
- What have you got, Charlie?
- A couple of wipes.
- Very good ones.
But you haven’t embroidered them too well though, Charlie.
We’ll have to pick the initials out with a needle.
- You'll need to learn how to do this, too.
- Yeah, the trademark.
In the meantime, you must learn how to make wallets.
- Like the Dodger. Would you like that?
- Yes, if you'll teach me.
Certainly, my boy, no fee.
Just do as Dodger and the others do.
Make them your models, especially Dodger.
He’s going to be a right little Bill Sikes.
Who’s Bill Sikes, Mr. Fagin?
He’s a very clever gentleman.
You’ll meet him tomorrow.
Maybe now. Is it possible, by chance...
...that my kerchief is protruding from my pocket?
- Yes. I can just see the edge.
- Can you?
See if you can take it out without my feeling it...
...like you saw the others do.
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two, boys
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two"
Is it gone?
Yes, Mr. Fagin. Look!
Well, that’s a surprise, I must say.
You’re a clever boy, Oliver.
I never saw a sharper lad.
Here’s a shilling for you.
I have to go to the bank.
Bedtime, all of you!
There’s a hard day’s work ahead!
Put up the shutters.
Where do I sleep, sir?
Over here, my dear.
Settle down!
Dodger, take your legs off his bed.
Where’s your manners?
Here, my dear, have a good sleep.
If you go on...
...the way you’ve started...
...you will be the greatest man of all time.
Sweet dreams, Oliver.
Sweet dreams.
Goodnight, sir.
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two, boys
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two"
Is he here?
Mr. Sikes. Has he come yet?
Nancy’s inside waiting for him.
- How’s business? Nice and brisk?
- Don’t burn your fingers, will you?
I never do, my dear. Not if I can help it.
Nancy! He’s back! He’s here!
Beautiful.
You’ve done well, Bill.
All one job?
Such a professional.
Now, Bill...
Carry cash? At this time of night?
All those thieves and robbers lurking in dark alleys?
I wouldn’t dare.
Besides, l’ve got to price it first.
Nancy’s waiting. Give you a good supper.
Tomorrow, Bill.
My word on it.
"Small pleasures, small pleasures
"Who would deny us these?
"Gin toddies, large measures
No skimping if you please!
"I rough it, I love it
Life is a game of chance
"I never tire of it
"Leading a merry dance
"If you don’t mind having to go without things
- "It’s a fine life!
- "It’s a fine life!
"Though it ain’t all jolly pleasure outings
It’s a fine life!
"It’s a fine life!
"When you’ve got someone to love
You forget your care and strife
"Let the prudes look down on us
Let the wide world frown on us
"It’s a fine, fine life!
"It’s a fine, fine life!
"Who cares if straight-laces
Sneer at us in the street?
"Fine airs and fine graces
Don’t have to sin to eat
"We wander through London
Who knows what we may find?
"There’s pockets left undone
On many a behind
"If you don’t mind taking it like it turns out
It’s a fine life!
"Keep the candle burning until it burns out
It’s a fine life!
"Though you sometimes do come by
The occasional black eye
"You can always cover one
Till he blacks the other one
"But you don’t dare cry
"No flounces, no feathers
No frills and furbelows
"All winds and all weathers
Ain’t good for fancy clothes
- "These trappings
- "These tatters
"These we can just afford
"What future?
"What matters?
We’ve got our bed and board
"If you don’t mind dealing with Fagin
It’s a fine life!
"It’s a fine life!
"Though diseased rats threaten to bring the plague in
- "It’s a fine life!
- "It’s a fine life!
"And the grass is green and dense
On the right side of the fence
"We take good care of it
That we get our share of it
"And we don’t mean pence
"If you don’t mind having to like or lump it
It’s a fine life!
"Though there’s no tea-sipping and eating crumpets
"It’s a fine life!
"It’s a fine life!
"Not for me, the happy home
"Happy husband, happy wife
"Though it sometimes touches me
For the likes of such as me
"Mine’s a fine, fine life!"
Bull’s-eye, come here!
Worth all the rest put together.
Can I help it? This is my private treasure.
My little pleasure. A cup of coffee...
...and a quick count-up.
I mean, who’s gonna look after me in my old age?
Would you, birdie?
Will you?
Why are you watching me?
Quick! Speak out!
I want to know every detail you saw! l’m sorry.
- Did you see where the box was?
- I don’t think so, sir.
- Be sure!
- Quite sure!
If you’re sure, then l’m sure.
Of course, I knew all along.
I didn’t mean to frighten you.
Brave boy, Oliver.
Did you see any of those pretty things, my dear?
Yes, sir.
They’re mine, Oliver.
My little treasure.
All I got to live on in my old age.
A terrible thing...
...old age.
Yes, sir. I’m sorry.
Can I go back to sleep now, sir?
Certainly, my boy, go to sleep.
Pleasant dreams.
Same to you, sir.
Sauce boat, George IIl, scroll handle, £5.
Tiara, George Il, rose-cut diamond paste, half a crown. l’m coming.
Bill, your breakfast is ready.
For God’s sake.
I'll warm it up for your supper.
Go down to Fagin’s and get the cash, will you?
All right.
I am trying to sleep.
You do love me, don’t you?
Of course I do! I live with you, don’t I?
That bit’s for me, Emmett Fagin.
Eat, eat, eat. Appetite.
Come on, finish your breakfast, it’s time for work.
Hurry up, you’ll miss the morning trade.
- Ain’t there no more sausages?
- You want supper tonight?
Who wants some bull’s-eyes?
Wait a minute! One at a time!
Go on and share them.
Miladies, they must meet our new boy.
What have we got here?
Ladies, I forgot that you must meet our new lodger...
...Mr. Oliver Twist, Esquire.
Nancy and Bet.
Charmed.
We’re all ladies and gentlemen around here. We’re all quality.
Don’t you take no notice of him. Just
"cause you got manners and they ain’t.
Whatcha mean I ain’t got no manners? l’m a regular gent, I am.
Permit me to assist you across the road?
I was going to the palace.
Doorman, a cab, if you please.
Allow me the privilege to escort you in my own carriage.
After you, Your Grace.
Sir Arthur, you are too kind.

Get to work, then. No argument.
There’s fine pickings in the street.
- Go and earn your keep.
- You said we could see the hanging!
Be sure it ain’t your own.
Fagin, l’m waiting.
Waiting, my dear? What for?
Bill will give you what for, if you don’t fork out. Hand over, start counting.
- Rush.
- What do you think we are?
- You and Bill, you’ll be the ruin of me!
- That’s right.
If it’s all the same to you.
- What was that for?
- For getting caught.
I was only practising.
I'll die a pauper yet. Here, take it.
I'll starve. You’ll find me in the gutter with me feet in the air.
Bill might think the count is a bit short, wouldn’t you say?
I only wish you had to get rid of the stuff, that’s all I wish.
He still might, come on.
So me and the boys we’ll live on air till I find a customer?
Heartless, that’s what I am.
Come on, Bet. Ta-ta, kids.
Young Oliver wants to come on the game with Charlie and me.
What’s that? On the job, you mean?
Can I? Please? I’d like to.
Would you? Well, why not?
You got to start somewhere.
You couldn’t do it in better company.
- Look after him, Dodger.
- Hats on, boys. Time we’re off.
- Then I can go, sir?
- Good luck on your first job, my dear.
I'll be waiting for you here when you come back.
- Line up!
- Line up!
- Single file!
- Single file!
- Quick march, left.
- Right.
- Left.
- Right.
"You can go, but be back soon
You can go, but while you’re working
"This place, l’m pacing "round
Until you’re home, safe and sound
"Fare thee well, but be back soon

"Do not forget this tune:
Be back soon

"How could we let
Our dear old Fagin worry?

We’ll come back home

Say, "Cheerio," not "Goodbye"

Be back soon

Come on!
Come here, boy. Give that back to me.
Give that back, come along.
Stop that boy!
Thief! My wallet! Stop that boy!
Hold that boy!
Stop, thief!
- Leave him to us.
- Stole a gent’s wallet.
We’ll catch him.
He went that way.
- Have you seen him?
- He’s disappeared, he’s gone.
Come here.
Come here, you!
Watch where you’re going!
There’s the gent he stole from.
Can you identify this boy as the thief?
Yes, I saw him run away.
Why didn’t you look after him?
Why didn’t you bring him back with you?
How can I help it?
A fine thing, Oliver in jail, and tomorrow he’ll be before a beak!
For pinching a wallet.
He goes to jail, what’s it matter? l’m afraid he may say something which will get us into trouble.
That’s very likely, Fagin.
You see, you’re blowed upon.
And l’m afraid, you see, that...
...if the game was up with us...
...it might be up with a good many more.
It would come out rather worse for you...
...than it would for me.
Why you miserable, sneaking, treacherous old...
You go down to that court in the morning...
...and you will find out what happens.
Me? Go to court?
With a magistrate sitting there?
I'll go, they won’t know me.
Good girl. Clever girl.
And if he does talk, you’ll come and tell us quick...
..."cause then we’ll have to look after ourselves, won’t we?
You won’t have to look after yourself.
"Cause l’ll look after you, believe me.
I always believe you. Have another drink.
Silence in court.
What crime is this one charged with?
He looks a thorough reprobate, to me.
Speak up, man! What’s he charged with?
He’s not charged, Your Worship.
This gentlemen appears against the boy.
- What boy? I see no boy.
- The boy in the dock, Your Worship.
- Yes. Stand up, boy!
- He is standing up.
Don’t be impertinent.
Put him on a box or something.
- What’s he charged with?
- Picking pockets, sir.
What’s your name, boy?
Does your father know you’re here?
He says he’s an orphan.
Where do you come from?
Where do you live?
Who looks after you?
He doesn’t seem able to say where he lives or anything else.
A liar as well as a thief.
And insolent, too. That settles it.
The boy is committed to three months with hard labour.
This is disgraceful! I demand to be heard.
You have not yet...
- I was there.
- Remove this lunatic! Clear the court.
I will speak, I saw what happened.
He was outside my shop.
Two other boys stole the wallet.
This child had nothing to do with it.
But sentence has been passed!
Hasn’t it?
He didn’t talk. Case was dismissed.
What a great judge! Fetch the boy.
- I’ve done my share.
- Look!
Now, come on.
Where are we going?
At least I can make some amends.
You’re coming home with me. Jump in.
- After them.
- Let the kid go.
- He can still blab on us, can’t he?
- Leave him be.
Don’t lose him.

We’ve got to get him back, do you hear?
Nab him the first time he sets foot out of the door.
He never goes out alone, you know that.
Don’t you back answer me, my girl.
Three days since I spotted him...
...and what have you done about it?
Nothing!
We’ve got to get hold of him somehow.
Now, who’s coming?
- Suppose it'll have to be me.
- Shut your trap, Dodger.
You’ve caused enough trouble already.
It’s going to be done quiet, no fuss.
Someone who has the boy’s confidence...
Nancy, my dear, what do you say?
It’s no good trying it on with me.
And just exactly what do you mean by that remark?
What I say. I’m not going!
Why can’t you leave the boy alone?
He won’t do you no harm!
Why can’t you leave him where he is?
Where he’ll have the chance at a good life?
You’ll bring him back here, my girl...
...unless you want to feel my hand on your throat.
Nancy, my dear, we must have that boy brought back.
If he talked, think what would happen to us. Think what would happen to Bill.
It would be the gallows for him, the drop.
You wouldn’t want that to happen, would you, my dear? Not to Bill.
- She'll go, Fagin.
- No, she won’t!
Yes, she will, Fagin!
She’ll go.
Even if I have to drag her there myself.

- Thank you.
- Please sir, these books came for you.
- Good.
- Wait, there’s some to go back.
- Boy’s gone, sir.
Can I take them for you?
I know where the shop is.
Please let me take them. I'll be quick.
All right. Mrs. Bedwin, the books are on the table beside my bed.
You’ll take those books to Mr. Jessop.
Tell him you have come to pay the £4.10 that I owe him.
This is £5 note, so there'll be 10 shillings change.
You understand?
She’s a very pretty lady, isn’t she, sir?
Yes.
I'll take the books for you.
In a new suit, with a set of valuable books, and £5 note in his pocket...
...you expect him back?
- Don’t you?
- If he does, l’ll eat my head with my hat.
- Look at that portrait.
Do you see a likeness to the lad?
- That’s your niece, isn’t it?
- That’s what I mean.
Wasn’t she the girl who...
Who ran away?
A young, innocent face, nothing more.
Mere coincidence. l’m not so sure.
Born in a workhouse at Dunstable, he thinks.
That’s all he can tell us. Very well.
"Who will buy this wonderful morning?"
- "Morning.
- "Morning.
"Such a sky you never did see
"Who will tie it up with a ribbon
And put it in a box for me?"
- Help!
- Get in the cart.
Bull’s-eye, come here.
- Oliver’s back.
- Look at his togs.
- He’s got books, too. Quite the little gent.
- Lovely bit of stuff.
Delighted to see you’re so well, my dear.
Dodger will give you another suit in case you spoil that Sunday one.
Look at this!
I'll bank it for you.
What’s that?
- That’s mine, Fagin.
- No. Mine, ours.
- You shall have the books.
- You hand it over, you old skeleton.
That’s for our share of the trouble.
You keep the books. Start a library.
Mr. Brownlow will be here after you if he finds out you’ve got his books and money.
So he’ll be here, will he?
Out here, after us?
- What did you tell him about us?
- Nothing.
I'll wager this young rat’s told him everything.
What did you tell him?
- No, leave him alone.
- You stand off me.
No violence.
You’ll have to kill me before you lay a hand on that boy.
Don’t you tell me. You keep out of this.
If he says he didn’t tell them, he didn’t tell them.
Hit me, would you?
I won’t stand by and see it done.
Let him be, or l’ll put my mark on you...
Nancy, you’re wonderful tonight!
Such talent! Such a joker!
You take care, I don’t know, but do it, Fagin...
...or l’ll put the finger on all of you, and I don’t care if I hang for it.
- Do you know who you are? What you are?
- You don’t have to tell me.
- A fine one for the boy to make a friend of.
- Yes, I am, God help me.
And I wish l’d been struck down dead before l’d laid a hand to bring him back.
From tonight he’s a liar...
...and a thief, and all that’s bad.
Ain’t that enough for you without beating him to death?
Come, come, Sikes.
We must have civil words.
Yes, you deserve them from me, don’t you?
I thieved for you when I was half his age.
- It’s your dirty work I been doing since.
- It’s a living isn’t it?
- He’s right, Nancy, a living is a living.
- Some living, Lord help me. Some living!
Get to bed, all of you.
Get to bed, I said!
All this violence, all these scenes, screams, dramas! l’m asking you, is it necessary?
Not yet, Fagin.
But if this godforsaken little good-for-nothing’s uttered one word...
If he has, the little devil...
...we sit down, talk it over, we think it out, we decide a safe action, we stay calm.
Do we? And while we’re sitting here...
...thinking, and talking, and staying calm...
...our collars get felt.
And it’s, "Come with me, if you please."
No, thank you.
You thought us into this lot.
You can think your way out of it.
From now on, Bill Sikes takes the law into his own hands.
These hands.
Have you ever heard the sound of a chicken getting its neck wrung?
Can’t say I have...
They squawk, Fagin, they squawk.
Not a very pretty sound.
No, Bill.
And then they die, don’t they?
Yes. I mean, no.
They say some even start squawking before that even.
They get what you might call a premonition.
You’re wouldn’t be having no premonition of that sort, would you?
Not me, Bill. The lips are sealed. l’m glad. Because if anyone here should lead the law to me...
...and I gets to hear of it, then it will be your neck.
Your scraggy old neck.
You think about it, Fagin.
A violent man, Dodger.
A very violent man.
When that man’s back is up, no one is safe.
Look after him, Dodger.
And l’ll look after myself.
A man’s got a heart, hasn’t he?
Joking apart, hasn’t he?
"Though l’d be the first one to say that I wasn’t a saint
"l’m finding it hard to be really as black as they paint
"l’m reviewing the situation:
"Can a fellow be a villain all his life?
"All the trials and tribulation!
Better settle down and get meself a wife
"And the wife would cook and sew for me
And come for me, and go for me
"And go for me and nag at me
The finger she would wag at me
"The money she would take from me
A misery, she’d make from me
"I think l’d better think it out again!
"A wife you can keep, anyway l’d rather sleep, anyway
"Left without anyone in the world

"So, how to win friends and to influence people?
"So, how?

"I must quickly look up everyone I know:
"Titled people with a station

"I will own a suite at Coleridge’s and run a fleet of carriages

"So, at my time of life I should start

"If you want to eat you’ve got to earn a bob!
"Is it such a humiliation
For a robber to perform an honest job?
"So a job l’m getting, possibly
I wonder who my boss'll be?
"I wonder if he’ll take to me?
What bonuses he’ll make to me?
"I'll start at 8:00, finish late
At normal rate, and all, but wait!

"I think l’d better think it out again
"What happens when l’m 70?
"Must come a time, 70
"When you’re old, and it’s cold

"You’ll be seeing no transformation
But it’s wrong to be a rogue in every way
"I don’t want nobody hurt for me

"There is no in-between for me

"I think l’d better think it out again!"
So, when I heard about dear little Oliver,
I decided to come to London.
- I decided.
- It was good of you to come.
What have you got to tell me?
This locket once belonged to the boy’s mother.
Found by the wife after she passed away.
The boy’s mother, that is, not my dear wife.
- You’ve kept this all these years?
- Why should I not?
Didn’t it occur to you that it might provide the answer to the boy’s parentage?
- His identity! His name!
- He had none. The mother was unmarried.
It is your clear duty to show this evidence to some higher authority.
- Your behaviour, madam, was shameful.
- How dare you speak to me so!
I only came here to help you.
You came here to profit from your own greed and dishonesty.
- You don’t think it belongs to my wife?
- Be quiet.
Your reward and something for the locket.
Your lucky you’re not in the law’s hands.
- Show these people out.
- There’s gratitude for you!
I hope this unfortunate circumstance won’t deprive me of my parochial office?
My hope, sir, is that it will.
But it was all Mrs. Bumble.
I knew nothing till yesterday.
No excuse. In the eyes of the law you are the more guilty of the two.
The law supposes your wife acts under your direction.
If that’s what the law supposes, sir, then the law’s an ass.
If that’s the eye of the law, sir, then law’s a bachelor.
The worst I wish the law is that it’s eye be opened by experience. By experience!
Sir, the locket, I didn’t really see it.
I recognised it at once. I gave it to my niece, Emily, on her 18th birthday.
So it wasn’t just her young man jilting her that made her run away?
No.
She must have made her way to that workhouse and had her baby there.
What’s going on?
- Why have you brought the boy here?
- "Cause he’s coming on a job...
...with me.
But, why him?
Because I need a little one. That’s why.
And he’s nice and thin.
And on this particular job, that’s what counts.
Must I go?
One word out of you...
...while you’re out with me and you know what will happen.
Bill, you can’t do this to him.
Please! You can’t!
- I won’t let you...
- No more of that.
You just be at the tavern at 11:00.
- I’ve come about Oliver. Tell Brownlow...
- You better come inside. Mr. Brownlow!
- No. I just want to leave a message.
- But he’ll want to see you.
- Please! I can’t stay!
- Sir, this person wants to...
- Who is it?
- It’s about the boy, sir.
- Is there news of him?
- He’s in danger.
He was dragged off the day you sent him out.
- Who took him?
- Me and someone else.
- You took him by force?
- Yes!
- Now I wish I had never been part of it.
- Where is he now?
Who is this other person?
Can you take me to him?
You want to help the boy.
Why else are you here?
- Then tell me where he is!
- I can’t!
I'll bring him to you. Not here. It’s too far.
Where, then?
London Bridge, tonight at midnight.
But you’ve got to come alone.
Promise you’ll come on your own!
You don’t trust me, do you?
But you’ve got to.
- I'll be there.
- Thank God. Let me go.
Wait! Is the boy hurt, ill-treated?
I can’t say no more. Please!
He’ll kill me as it is if he finds out.
- Who is this man?
- No, I won’t tell you.
Whatever I do, I won’t turn on him.
You wouldn’t understand. l’ve got to go back.
I want to go back.
- Promise you’ll come?
- At 12:00.
Remember, you little worm, the front door.
There.
Hurry!
Look above you.
Who is it? Who’s there?
Rufus! Dragon! Come down, seize him!
Seize him! Good dog!
Why worry, my dear? He always turns up!
Maybe he’s taken Oliver back to my place.
- He said he was coming straight here.
- And that’s what he’ll do.
- Everything all right, Bill?
- No it’s not, Fagin.
- The brat woke them up. We had to run.
- Anybody see you?
No.
I'll just take the boy and put him to bed.
I'll be back.
Put him back.

Bull’s-eye...
Bull’s-eye, watch him, will you? Go on!

Now go on. Quick!
Go on. Go on.
- Stop!
- I'll pay you back.

Bull’s-eye! Come here, boy.
Bull’s-eye, come here.
You come here, Bull’s-eye.
You come here, Bull’s-eye.
They’ve seen you, Bull’s-eye.
So, you can’t come with me no further.
"Cause if you do, they'll know you.
Come.
You ain’t afraid of me, are you?
Bull’s-eye, come here.
Come here!
Did you see anyone about?
I don’t know.
I thought I saw someone running.
Here, that dog was here just now.
Wait a minute. I think I know him.
Bull’s-eye?
That’s Bill Sikes" dog.
They’re always around together.
If anyone can find Sikes for you, he can.
Come on. Come on, boy.
Brass! I want some brass! l’ve got to get away.
- What’s wrong, Bill?
- I want brass, money!
There’s blood on your coat.
Where’s Nancy?
Bill Sikes, what did you do?
She won’t peach on nobody no more.
You shouldn’t have done that.
- She peached? Are you sure?
- She must have, mustn’t she?
She was handing the boy over to Brownlow on the bridge.
He was there, waiting for her.
What did you come here for?
Get out! Do you hear? Get out!
I want money.
How much? 10? 20?
- If anyone should come here...
- They won’t find me. l’m not going to stand here and wait for them...
It’s him.

Quick, boys! All of you!
We’re changing lodgings!
Nancy, I loved you, didn’t I?
Look what you’ve done to me.
Bill, why make things worse? Leave him.
It’s me they’re after, but they won’t go for me if he’s near.
Keep out of it!
Out the back way. Come on!
- Look up there!
- It’s him! Bill Sikes!
It’s him for sure!
And the boy.
Scoundrel!
Get back!
The other street, quickly!
- After you, Fagin.
- After you, Dodger.
Don’t bother with that. Get out of it.
- What do I do?
- Live up to your name, dodge about!
Get up there!
Now, then. Loop the rope over the end of the beam.

Freddy, go and find a cab.

Don't just stand there, Freddy.
Go and find a cab.
All right, I'll get one.
Look where you're goin', dear.
Look where you're goin'!
I'm so sorry.
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.
A full day's wages.
-Freddy, go and find a cab.
-Yes, Mother.
He's your son, is he?
If you'd done your duty as a mother should...
...you wouldn't let 'im spoil a poor girl's flow'rs and run away without payin'.
Go about your business, my girl.
And you wouldn't go off without payin', either.
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.
Sir, is there any sign of it stopping?
I'm afraid not. It's worse than before.
If it's worse, it's a sign it's nearly over.
Cheer up, Capt'n, buy a flow'r off a poor girl.
I'm sorry, I haven't any change.
I can change 'alf a crown.
Take this for tuppence.
I told you, I'm awfully sorry.
Wait a minute.
Oh, yes. Here's three ha' pence, if that's any use to you.
Thank you, sir.
You be careful.
Better give 'im a flower for it.
There's a bloke here behind that pillar...
...takin' down every blessed word you're sayin'.
I ain't done nothin' wrong by speakin' to the gentleman.
I've a right to sell flow'rs if I keep off the curb.
I'm a respectable girl, so help me.
I never spoke to him except to ask him to buy a flow'r off me.
-What's the bloomin' noise?
-A tec's takin' her down.
I'm makin' an honest livin'.
Who's doing all that shouting?
Sir, don't let 'im charge me.
You dunno what it means to me.
They'll take away me character and drive me on the streets...
...for speakin' to gentlemen.
There, there. Who's hurting you, you silly girl? What'd you take me for?
On my Bible oath, I never spoke a word.
Shut up! Do I look like a policeman?
Why'd ya take down me words?
'Ow do I know you took me down right?
You just show me what you wrote ab'ut me.
That ain't proper writin'. I can't read it.
I can.
"l say, Capt'n, now buy a flow'r off a poor girl."
Oh, it's cause I called him "Capt'n."
I meant no 'arm. Sir, don't let him lay a charge against me for a word like that.
I'll make no charge.
Really, sir, if you are a detective...
...you needn't protect me against molestation from young women...
...until I ask you.
Anyone could tell the girl meant no harm.
He ain't no tec. He's a gentleman.
Look at his boots.
How are all your people down at Selsey?
Who told you my people come from Selsey?
Never mind, they do.
How do you come to be up so far east?
You were born in Lisson Grove.
What 'arm is there in my leavin' Lisson Grove?
It weren't fit for pigs to live.
I had to pay four and six a week.
Live where you like but stop that noise!
Come, come, he can't touch you.
You've a right to live where you please.
I'm a good girl, I am.
-Where do I come from?
-Hawkestone.
Who said I didn't?
Blimey, you know everything, you do.
You, sir, do you think you could find me a taxi?
Madam, it's stopped raining.
You can get a motorbus to Hampton Court..
Isn't that where you live?
What impertinence!
Tell 'im where he comes from, if you wanta go fortune-telling.
Cheltenham, Harrow...
...Cambridge and...
...India?
Quite right.
He ain't a tec, he's a bloomin' busybody.
Do you do this sort of thing for a living at a music hall?
I have thought of it.
Perhaps I will one day.
He's no gentleman, he ain't, to interfere with a poor girl!
How do you do it, may I ask?
Simple phonetics. The science of speech.
That's my profession. Also my hobby.
Anyone can spot an lrishman or a Yorkshireman by his brogue...
...but I can place a man within six miles.
I can place 'im within two miles in London.
Sometimes within two streets.
Ought to be ashamed of 'imself, unmanly coward.
-Is there a living in that?
-Oh, yes.
Let him mind his own business and leave a poor girl alone.
Cease this detestable boohooing instantly...
...or else seek the shelter of some other place of worship!
I have a right to be here if I like, same as you!
A woman who utters such disgusting, depressing noises...
...has no right to be anywhere, no right to live.
Remember, you're a human with a soul...
...and the divine gift of articulate speech.

...Milton and the Bible. Don't sit there crooning like a bilious pigeon.

"The Hebrews learn it backwards which is absolutely frightening"
"Use proper English, you're regarded as a freak"
"Oh, why can't the English"
"Why can't the English learn to speak?"
Thank you.
See this creature with her curbstone English...
...that'll keep her in the gutter till the end of her days?
In six months I could pass her off as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.
I could get her a job as a lady's maid or a shop assistant...
...which requires better English.
What's that you say?
Yes, you squashed cabbage leaf!
You disgrace to the noble architecture of these columns!
You incarnate insult to the English language!
I could pass you off as the Queen of Sheba.
You don't believe that, Capt'n?
Anything's possible.
I, myself, am a student of Indian dialects.
Are you? Do you know Colonel Pickering, the author of Spoken Sanskrit?
I am Colonel Pickering. Who are you?
I'm Henry Higgins, author of Higgins' Universal Alphabet.
I came from India to meet you!
I was going to India to meet you!
-Where are you staying?
-At the Carleton.
No, you're not.
You're staying at 27A Wimpole Street.
You come with me.
We'll have a little jaw over supper.
Indian dialects have always fascinated me.
Buy a flower. I'm short for me lodgin'.
Liar!
You said you could change half a crown.
You ought to be stuffed with nails, you ought!
Here, take the whole bloomin' basket for a sixpence!
A reminder.
-How many are there actually?
-How many what?
Indian dialects?
No fewer than 147 distinct languages are recorded as vernacular in India.

Come on, Alfie, let's go 'ome now.
This place is givin' me the willies.
Home? What do you want to go 'ome for?
It's nearly 5:00.
My daughter Eliza'll be along soon.
She ought to be good for 'alf a crown for a father that loves 'er.
That's a laugh.
You ain't been near 'er for months.
What's that got to do with it?
What's 'alf a crown after all I've give 'er?
When did you ever give 'er anythin'?
Anythin'? I give 'er everythin'.
I give 'er the greatest gift any human being can give to another:
Life!
I introduced 'er to this here planet, I did, with all its wonders and marvels.
The sun that shines, the moon that glows.
Hyde Park to walk through on a fine spring night.
The 'ole ruddy city o' London to roam around in sellin' 'er bloomin' flow'rs.
I give 'er all that.
Then I disappears and leaves 'er on 'er own to enjoy it.
If that ain't worth 'alf a crown now and again...
...l'll take my belt off and give 'er what for.
You got a good 'eart.
But you want a 'alf a crown out o' Eliza...
...you better have a good story.
Leave that to me, my boy.
-Good mornin', George.
-Not a brass farthin'.
Not a brass farthin'.
There she is.
Why, Liza, what a surprise.
Hop along, Charlie, you're too old for me
-Don't you know your daughter?
-You don't know what she looks like.
I know 'er, I know 'er.
Come on, I'll find 'er.
Eliza, what a surprise.
Not a brass farthin'.
Hey, you come 'ere, Eliza.
I ain't gonna take me 'ard-earned wages...
...and let you pass 'em on to a bloody pubkeeper.
You wouldn't send me 'ome to your stepmother...
...without a drop o' liquid protection, would ya?
Stepmother, indeed!
Well, I'm willin' to marry 'er.
It's me that suffers by it.
I'm a slave to that woman, Eliza.
Just because I ain't 'er lawful 'usband.
Slip your ol' dad just 'alf a crown to go 'ome on.
Well, I had a bit o' luck meself last night.
But don't keep comin' around countin' on 'alf crowns from me!
Thank you, Eliza. You're a noble daughter.
"Beer, beer, glorious beer
"Fill yourself right up"
See this creature with her curbstone English...
...that will keep her in the gutter till the end of her days?
In six months, I could pass her off as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.
I could get her a job as a lady's maid or a shop assistant...
...which requires better English.
You disgrace to the noble architecture of these columns!
I could get her a job as a lady's maid or a shop assistant...
...which requires better English.
How many vowel sounds did you hear altogether?
I believe I counted 24.
Wrong by 100. To be exact you heard 130.
Listen to them one at a time.
Must l? I'm really quite done up for one morning.
Your name, please?
Your name, miss?
My name is of no concern to you whatsoever.
One moment, please.
London is gettin' so dirty these days.
I'm Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper.
Can I help you?
Good morning, missus.
I'd like to see the professor, please.
Could you tell me what it's about?
It's business of a personal nature.
One moment, please.
-Mr. Higgins?
-What is it, Mrs. Pearce?
There's a young woman who wants to see you, sir.
A young woman?
What does she want?
She's quite a common girl, sir.
Very common indeed.
I should've sent her away, only I thought...
...you wanted her to talk into your machine.
-Has she an interesting accent?
-Simply ghastly.
Good. Let's have her in.
Show her in, Mrs. Pearce.
This is rather a bit of luck.
I'll show you how I make records.
We'll set her talking, then I'll take her down first in Bell's Visible Speech...
...then in broad Romic.
Then we'll get her on the phonograph..."
...so you can turn her on when you want with the written transcript before you.
This is the young woman, sir.
Good mornin', my good man.
Might I 'ave a word with you?
Oh, no. This is the girl
I jotted down last night.
She's no use. I got the records I want of the Lisson Grove lingo.
I won't waste another cylinder on that.
Be off with you. I don't want you.
Don't be so saucy.
You ain't 'eard what I come for yet.
Did you tell 'im I come in a taxi?
Nonsense. Do you think a gentleman like Mr. Higgins cares...
...what you came in?
Oh, we are proud.
He ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im.
I 'eard 'im say so
I ain't come here to ask for any compliment...
...and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.
Good enough for what?
Good enough for you.
Now you know, don't ya?
I'm come to 'ave lessons.
And to pay for 'em, too, make no mistake.
Well!
And what do you expect me to say?
Well, if you was a gentleman, you might ask me to sit down, I think.
Don't I tell you I'm bringin' you business?
Should we ask this baggage to sit down...
...or shall we just throw her out of the window?
I won't be called a baggage.
Not when I've offered to pay like any lady.
What do you want, my girl?
I want to be a lady in a flow'r shop...
...'stead of sellin' at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.
But they won't take me unless I can talk more genteel.
He said 'e could teach me.
Well, 'ere I am ready to pay 'im.
Not asking any favor and he treats me as if I was dirt.
I know what lessons cost as well as you do and I'm ready to pay.
How much?
Now you're talkin'.
I thought you'd come off it for a chance to get back...
...a bit of what you chucked at me last night.
You'd had a drop in, 'adn't you?
Sit down.
-If you're goin' t' make a compliment of it--
-Sit down!
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.
What's your name?
Eliza Doolittle.
Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?
I don't mind if I do.
How much do you propose to pay me for these lessons?
Oh, I know what's right.
My lady friend gets French lessons for 18 pence an hour...
...from a real French gentleman.
You wouldn't have the face to ask me the same...
...for teachin' me my own language as you would for French
I won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave it.
Do you know, Pickering, if you think of a shilling...
...not as a simple shilling, but as a percentage of this girl's income...
...it works out as fully equivalent of...
...60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.
By George, it's enormous.
It's the biggest offer I ever had.
Sixty pounds? What are you talkin' about?
Where would I get 60 pounds
-I never offered you 60 pounds!
-Hold your tongue!
But I ain't got 60 pounds
Don't cry, silly girl. Sit down.
Nobody's going to touch your money.
Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick if you don't stop sniveling.
Sit down!
Anybody'd think you was my father!
If I decide to teach you,
I'll be worse than two fathers to you.
What's this for?
To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part of your face that feels moist.
Remember, that's your handkerchief and that's your sleeve.
Don't confuse one with the other, if you want to become a lady in a shop
It's no use to talk to her like that.
She doesn't understand you.
Give the 'andkerchief to me.
He give it to me, not to you!
Higgins, I'm interested.
What about your boast...
...you could pass her off as a duchess at the Embassy Ball?
I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive if you do that.
I'll bet you all the expenses of the experiment that you can't do it.
I'll even pay for the lessons
You're real good. Thank ye, Capt'n.
It's almost irresistible.
She's so deliciously low.
So horribly dirty.
I ain't dirty! I washed my face an' hands before I come, I did.
I'll take it. I'll make a duchess of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.
We'll start today. This moment.
Take her away and clean her.
Sandpaper, if it won't come off.
Is there a fire in the kitchen?
Take her clothes off and burn them and order some new ones.
Just wrap her in brown paper till they come.
You're no gentleman, you're not, to talk o' such things.
I'm a good girl, I am.
And I know what the likes of you are, I do.
We want none of your slum prudery here, young woman.
You've got to learn to behave like a duchess.
Take her away, Mrs. Pearce.
If she gives you any trouble, wallop her.
I'll call the police, I will.
I've got no place to put her.
Well, put her in the dustbin.
Come, Higgins, be reasonable.
You must be reasonable,
Mr. Higgins, you must.
You can't walk over everybody like this.
I?
Walk over everybody?
My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering,
I had no intention of walking over anybody.
I merely suggested we should be kind to this poor girl.
I didn't express myself clearly because I didn't wish to hurt her delicacy...
...or yours.
But, sir, you can't take a girl up like that...
...as if you were picking up a pebble on the beach.
Why not?
Why not? But you don't know anything about her.
What about her parents?
She may be married.
Garn!
There. As the girl very properly says, "garn! "
Who'd marry me?
By George, Eliza...
...the streets will be strewn with the bodies of men...
...shooting themselves for your sake before I'm done with you.
I'm goin'.
He's off his chump, he is.
I don't want no balmies teachin' me.
Mad? All right, Mrs. Pearce, don't order those new clothes
-Throw her out.
-Stop! I won't allow it.
Go home to your parents, girl.
I ain't got no parents.
She ain't got no parents. What's the fuss?
Nobody wants her. She's no use to anyone but me. Take her upstairs!
What's to become of her? ls she to be paid anything?
Do be sensible, sir.
What'd she do with money?
She'll have food and clothes.
She'll drink if you give her money.
You are a brute! It's a lie!
Nobody ever saw the sign o' liquor on me.
Sir, you're a gentleman.
Don't let 'im speak to me like that
Does it occur to you, Higgins, the girl has some feelings?
No, I don't think so.
No feelings we need worry about.
Well, have you, Eliza?
I got me feelings same as anyone else.
Mr. Higgins, I must know on what terms the girl is to be here.
What'll become of her when you've finished teaching?
You must look ahead a little, sir.
What'll become of her if we leave her in the gutter, Mrs. Pearce?
That's her own business, not yours, Mr. Higgins.
When I'm done, we'll throw her back.
Then it'll be her own business again.
That'll be all right, won't it?
You've no feelin' 'eart in ya!
You don't care for nothin' but yourself.
I've 'ad enough of this. I'm goin'!
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
Have some chocolates, Eliza.
'Ow do I know what might be in 'em?
I've 'eard of girls bein' drugged by the likes o' you.
Pledge of good faith.
I'll take one half.
And you take the other.
You'll have boxes of them, barrels of them every day.
You'll live on them, eh?
I wouldn't 've ate it, only I'm too ladylike to take it out o' me mouth.
Think of it, Eliza.
Think of chocolates, and taxis...
...and gold and diamonds.
I don't want no gold and no diamonds.
I'm a good girl, I am.
Higgins, I really must interfere.
Mrs. Pearce is quite right.
If this girl will put herself in your hands for six months...
...for an experiment in teaching, she must understand thoroughly what she's doing.
You are to stay here for the next six months...
...learning how to speak beautifully like a lady in a florist shop.
If you're good and do what you're told, you'll sleep in a proper bedroom...
...have lots to eat, money to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis.
But if you are naughty and idle...
...you'll sleep in the kitchen amongst the black beetles...
...and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce with a broomstick.
At the end of six months, you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace...
...in a carriage, beautifully dressed.
If the king finds out that you are not a lady...
...the police will take you to the Tower of London where your head will be cut off...
...as a warning to other presumptuous flower girls.
But if you are not found out, you shall have a present of...
...seven and six to start life with as a lady in a shop.
If you refuse this offer...
...you will be the most ungrateful, wicked girl...
...and the angels will weep for you!
Are you satisfied, Pickering?
I don't understand what you're talking about.
Could I put it more plainly or fairly,
Mrs. Pearce?
Come with me.
That's right.
Bundle her off to the bathroom.
You're a great bully, you are!
I won't stay here if I don't like it.
I won't let nobody wallop me
Don't answer back, girl.
I've always been a good girl, I 'ave.
In six months...in three, if she has a good ear and a quick tongue...
...l'll take her anywhere and I'll pass her off as anything.
I'll make a queen of that barbarous wretch!
I've never had a bath in me life.
Not what you'd call a proper one.
You know you can't be a nice girl inside if you're dirty outside.
I'll have to put you in here.
This will be your bedroom.
I couldn't sleep in here, missus.
It's too good for the likes o' me.
I should be afraid to touch anythin'.
I ain't a duchess yet, you know.
What's this?
This where you wash clothes?
This is where we wash ourselves, Eliza.
And where I'm going to wash you.
You expect me to get into that and wet meself all over?
Not me!
I shall catch me death.
Come along now.
Come along.
Take your clothes off.
Here, come on. Help me take these--
Take your hands off me!
I'm a good girl, I am!
It ain't right! It ain't decent!
Get your hands off me!
I'm a good girl, I am!
Forgive the bluntness, but if I'm to be in this business...
...l shall feel responsible for the girl.
I hope it's clearly understood that no advantage is to be taken of her position.
What, that thing? Sacred, I assure you.
Come now, you know what I mean.
This is no trifling matter.
Are you a man of good character where women are concerned?
Have you ever met a man of good character where women are concerned?
Yes, very frequently.
I haven't. The moment I let a woman make friends with me...
...she becomes jealous, exacting...
...suspicious and a damned nuisance.
The moment that I make friends with a woman I become selfish and tyrannical.
So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor and likely to remain so.
Well, after all, Pickering....

Get out of 'ere. Jamie, you get out, too!
Come on, Doolittle. And remember, drinks is to be paid for or not drunk.
Thanks for your 'ospitality, George.
Send the bill to Buckingham Palace.
Well, Alfie, there's nothin' else to do.
I guess it's back to work.
Work! Don't you dare mention that word in my presence again.
Look at all these poor blighters down here.
I used to do that sort of thing once.
Just for exercise
It's not worth it. Takes up your whole day.
Don't worry, boys.
We'll get outta this somehow.
How do you think you'll do that?
How? Same as always.
Faith, hope and a little bit o' luck.

You'd make a good suffragette, Alfie.
Why, there's the lucky man now.
The Honorable Alfie Doolittle.
What are you doing in Eliza's house?
Her former residence!
You can buy your own drinks now,
Alfie Doolittle.
Fallen into a tub of butter, you have.
What are you talkin' about?
Your daughter, Eliza.
You're a lucky man, Alfie Doolittle.
What about Eliza?
He don't know.
Her own father an' he don't know.
Moved in with a swell, Eliza has.
Left here in a taxi all by herself, smart as paint.
An' ain't been home for three days.
Go on.
And this mornin' I gets a message from 'er.
She wants her things sent over...
...to 27A Wimpole Street...
...care of Professor Higgins.
An' what things does she want?
Her birdcage and her Chinese fan.
But she says:
"Never mind about sending any clothes."
I knew she had a career in front of 'er.
We're in for a booze-up.
The sun is shining on Alfred P. Doolittle.

The mail, sir.
Pay the bills and say no to the invitations.
You simply cannot go on working the girl this way.
Making her say her alphabet over and over...
...from sunup to sundown, even during meals.
You'll exhaust yourself. When will it stop?
When she does it properly, of course.
Is that all, Mrs. Pearce?
There's another letter from the
American millionaire, Ezra D. Wallingford.
He still wants you for his Moral Reform League.
Throw it away.
It's the third letter he's written you.
You should at least answer it.
All right, leave it on the desk, Mrs. Pearce.
I'll try and get to it.
If you please, sir. There's a dustman downstairs, Alfred P. Doolittle...
...who wants to see you.
He says you have his daughter here.
I say!
Well, send the blackguard up.
He may not be a blackguard, Higgins.
Nonsense. Of course he's a blackguard, Pickering.
I'm afraid we'll have some trouble with him.
No, I think not. Any trouble to be had, he'll have it with me. Not I with him.
Doolittle, sir.
-Professor Higgins?
-Here!
Where?
Good morning, Governor.
I come about a very serious matter,
Governor.
Brought up in Houndslow.
Mother Welsh, I should think.
What is it you want, Doolittle?
I want my daughter, that's what I want.
See?
Of course you do.
You're her father, aren't you?
I'm glad to see you have a spark of family feeling left.
She's in there. Yes, take her away at once.
What?
Take her away. Do you think I am going to keep your daughter for you?
Now, is this reasonable, Governor?
Is it fairity to take advantage of a man like that?
The girl belongs to me. You got 'er.
Where do I come in?
How dare you come here and attempt to blackmail me!
You sent her here on purpose!
Don't take a man up like that, Governor.
The police shall take you up.
This is a plan...
...a plot to extort money by threats.
I shall telephone the police.
Have I asked you for a brass farthin'?
Domnu say '.
I leave it to this gentleman 'ere.
Have I said a word about money?
Well, what else did you come for?
What would a bloke come for?
Be 'uman, Governor.
Alfred, you sent her here on purpose.
So help me, Governor, I never did.
How did you know she was here?
I'd tell you, Governor, if you'd let me get a word in.
I'm willing to tell ya.
I'm wanting to tell ya.
I'm waiting to tell ya!
You know, Pickering, this chap's got a certain natural gift of rhetoric..
Observe the rhythm of his native woodnotes wild.
"l'm willing to tell you. I'm wanting to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you."
That's the Welsh strain in 'im.
How did you know Eliza was here if you didn't send 'er?
Well, she sent back for her luggage and I got to 'ear about it.
She said she didn't want no clothes.
What was I to think from that, Governor?
I ask you, as a parent, what was I to think?
So you came here to rescue her from worse than death, eh?
-Yes, sir, Governor. That's right.
-Yes.
Mrs. Pearce!
Eliza's father has come to take her away.
Give her to him, will you?
Now wait a minute, Governor.
Wait a minute.
You and me is men o' the world, ain't we?
Men of the world, are we?
Perhaps you'd better go, Mrs. Pearce.
I think so indeed, sir!
Here, Governor.
I've took a sort of a fancy to you and...
...if you want the girl, I ain't so set on 'avin' her home again...
...but what I might be open to is an arrangement.
All I ask is my rights as a father.
You're the last man alive to expect me to let her go for nothing.
I can see you're a straight sort, Governor.
So...
...what's a five pound note to you?
An' what's Eliza to me?
I think you should know, Doolittle...
...that Mr. Higgins' intentions are entirely honorable.
Of course they are, Governor.
If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask 50.
You mean, you'd sell your daughter for 50 pounds?
Have you no morals, man?
No, I can't afford 'em, Governor. Neither could you if you was as poor as me.
Not that I mean any 'arm, but...
...if Eliza is gonna have a bit out o' this, why not me, too? Why not?
Look at it my way. What am l?
I ask ya, what am l? I'm one o' the undeserving poor, that's what I am.
Think what that means to a man.
It means he's up against middle-class morality for all the time.
If there's anything goin' an' I ask for a bit of it, it's always the same story:
"You're undeservin', so you can't have it."
But my needs is as great as the most deservin' widows that ever got money...
...out of six different charities in one week for the death o' the same 'usband.
I don't need less than a deservin' man,
I need more.
I don't eat less 'earty than he does and I drink...
...a lot more.
I'm playin' straight with you.
I ain't pretendin' to be deservin'.
No, I'm undeservin'...
...and I mean to go on bein' undeservin'.
I like it an' that's the truth
But will you take advantage of a man's nature...
...do him out of the price of his own daughter, what he's brought up..
...fed and clothed by the sweat of his brow...
...till she's growed big enough to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?
Is five pounds unreasonable,
I put it to you?
And I leave it to you.
You know, Pickering, if we took this man in hand for three months...
...he could choose between a seat in the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales
-We'd better give 'im a fiver.
-He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.
Not me, Governor, so 'elp me I won't.
Just one good spree for meself an' the missus...
...givin' pleasure to ourselves and employment to others.
An' satisfaction to you to know it ain't been throwed away.
You couldn't spend it better.
This is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.
The missus wouldn't have the 'eart to spend ten.
Ten pounds is a lot o' money.
Makes a man feel prudent-like, and then goodbye to 'appiness.
No, you just give me what I ask, Governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.
I rather draw the line at encouraging this sort of immorality.
Why don't you marry that missus of yours?
After all, marriage isn't so frightening.
You married Eliza's mother.
Who told you that, Governor?
Well, nobody told me.
I concluded, naturally....
If we listen to this man for another minute we'll have no convictions left.
-Five pounds, I think you said.
-Thank you, Governor.
Are you sure you won't have ten?
No. No, perhaps another time.
I beg your pardon, miss.
I won't say those ruddy vowels one more time.
Blimey, it's Eliza.
I never thought she'd clean up so good-looking.
She does me credit, don't she?
What are you doin' here?
Now, you hold your tongue and don't you give these gentlemen none o' your lip.
If you have any trouble with 'er, give 'er a few licks o' the strap.
That's the way to improve 'er mind.
Well, good morning, gentlemen.
Cheerio, Eliza.
There's a man for you.
A philosophical genius of the first water
Write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford and tell him...
...if he wants a lecturer, to get in touch with Mr. Doolittle...
...a common dustman, one of the most original moralists in England.
What did he come for?
Say your vowels.
I know me vowels.
I knew 'em before I come.
If you know them, say them.
-Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.
-A, E, I, O, U.
That's what I said. Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.
That's what I've said for three days an' I won't no more.
I know it's difficult, Miss Doolittle, but try to understand.
There's no use explaining.
As a military man you should know that.
Drilling is what she needs.
Leave her alone or she'll turn to you for sympathy.
Very well, if you insist, but have a little patience with her.
Of course.
Say "A".
You ain't got no 'eart, you ain't.
I promise you, you'll say your vowels correctly before this day is out...
...or there'll be no lunch, no dinner, and no chocolates.
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins
Just you wait"
"You'll be sorry
But your tears will be too late"
"You'll be broke and I'll have money
Will I help you? Don't be funny!"
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins
Just you wait"
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins
Till you're sick"
"And you screams
To fetch a doctor double-quick"
"l'll be off a second later
And go straight to the theater"
"Ho, ho, ho, 'Enry 'lggins
Just you wait!"
"Just you wait
Until we're swimmin' in the sea"
"And you get the cramp a little ways from me"
"When you yell you're gonna drown
I'll get dressed and go to town"
"Just you wait!"
"One day I'll be famous
I'll be proper and prim"
"Go to St. James so often
I will call it St. Jim"
"One evening the king will say"
"Oh, Liza, old thing"
"l want all of England your praises to sing"
"Next week on the 20th of May"
"l proclaim Liza Doolittle Day"
"All the people will celebrate the glory of you"
"And whatever you wish and want
I gladly will do"
"Thanks a lot, King,' says I in a manner well-bred"
"But all I want is 'Enry 'lggins' 'ead'"
"Done!"
"Says the king with a stroke"
"Guard, run and bring in the bloke'"
"Then they'll march you, 'Enry 'lggins, to the wall"
"And the king will tell me"
"Liza, sound the call"
"As they raise their rifles higher"
"l'll shout: 'Ready, aim, fire!"
"Ho, ho, ho, 'Enry 'lggins, down you go"
"Just you wait!"
-All right, Eliza, say it again.
-"The rine in Spine stais minely in the pline."
"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain."
Didn't I saiy that?
No, Eliza, you didn't "saiy" that.
You didn't even "say" that.
Every night before you go to bed, where you used to say your prayers...
...l want you to say:
"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain."
Fifty times.
You'll get much further with the Lord if you learn not to offend His ears.
Now for your "H's."
Pickering, this is going to be ghastly.
Control yourself, Higgins.
Give the girl a chance.
I suppose you can't expect her to get it right the first time.
Come here, Eliza, and watch closely.
Now, you see that flame?
Every time you pronounce the letter "H" correctly the flame will waver...
...and every time you drop your "H" the flame will remain stationary.
That's how to know you've done it correctly.
In time, your ear will hear the difference.
You'll see it better in the mirror.
Now listen carefully.
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire...
"...hurricanes hardly ever happen."
Now you repeat that after me.
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen."
"In 'artford, 'ereford and 'ampshire
'urricanes 'ardly hever 'appen."
Oh, no, no!
Have you no ear at all?
-Should I do it over?
-No, please.
Start from the very beginning.
Just do this.
Go on, go on..
Does the same thing hold true in India?
Have they the peculiar habit of not only dropping a letter...
...but using it where it doesn't belong, like "hever" instead of "ever"?
The girl, Higgins!
Go on. Go on.
"Oh, poor Professor Higgins"
"Night and day he slaves away"
"Oh, poor Professor Higgins"
"All day long on his feet"
"Up and down until he's numb"
"Doesn't rest, doesn't eat"
"Doesn't touch a crumb"
Again, Eliza.
"How kind of you to let me come."
No. "Kind of you."
Kind of you.
"How kind of you to let me come."
No. "Kind of you."
"Kind of you". lt's like ''cup of tea.''
Cup of tea. Say, "cup of tea."
Cuppatea.
No. "A cup of tea."
It's awfully good cake.
I wonder where Mrs. Pearce gets it.
First rate. And those strawberry tarts are delicious. Did you try the pline cake?
Try it again.
-Did you try the--
-Pickering!
Again, Eliza.
Cuppatea.
Oh, no.
Can't you hear the difference?
Look, put your tongue forward until it squeezes on the top of your lower teeth.
And then say "cup."
Then say "of."
Then say "cup, cup, cup, cup, of, of, of, of."
By Jove, Higgins, that was a glorious tea.
You finish the last strawberry tart.
I couldn't eat another thing.
-I couldn't touch it.
-Shame to waste it.
Oh, it won't be wasted. I know somebody who's immensely fond of strawberry tarts.
"Poor Professor Higgins"
"On he plods against all odds"
"Poor Professor Higgins"
"Nine p.m., ten p.m."
"On through midnight every night"
"One a.m., two a.m., three..."
Four.
Five.
Six marbles.
I want you to read this and I want you to enunciate...
...every word just as if the marbles were not in your mouth.
"With blackest moss, the flower pots...
"...were thickly crusted, one and all."
Each word, clear as a bell.
"With blackest moss the flower pots."
I can't!
I say, Higgins, are those pebbles really necessary?
If they were necessary for Demosthenes they are necessary for Eliza Doolittle.
Go on, Eliza.
"With the blackest moss the flower pots were thickly crusted one and--"
I can't understand a word, not a word.
Perhaps the poem is a little too difficult for the girl
Why don't you try something simpler, like The Owl and the Pussycat?
Yes, that's a charming one.
Pickering, I can't hear a word the girl is saying
What's the matter?
I swallowed one.
It doesn't matter. I've got plenty more.
Open your mouth. One, two....
"Quit, Professor Higgins"
"Hear our plea, or payday we will quit"
"Ay' not 'l', 'O' not 'ow'"
"Pounding, pounding in our brain"
"Ay' not 'l', 'O' not 'ow'"
"Don't say 'rine' say 'rain'"
"The rain in Spain...
...stays mainly in the plain."
I can't!
I'm so tired!
For God's sake, Higgins, it must be 3:00 in the morning.
Do be reasonable.
I am always reasonable.
Eliza, if I can go on with a blistering headache, you can.
I got a 'eadache, too.
I know your head aches.
I know you're tired.
I know your nerves are as raw as meat in a butcher's window.
But think what you're trying to accomplish.
Just think what you're dealing with.
The majesty and grandeur of the English language...
It's the greatest possession we have.
The noblest thoughts that ever flowed through the hearts of men...
...are contained in its extraordinary, imaginative...
...and musical mixtures of sounds.
And that's what you've set yourself out to conquer, Eliza.
And conquer it you will.
Now try it again.
"The rain in Spain...
...stays mainly in the plain."
What was that?
"The rain in Spain ...
...stays mainly in the plain."
Again.
I think she's got it.
"By George, she's got it
By George, she's got it"
"Now once again
Where does it rain?"
"On the plain, on the plain"
"And where's that soggy plain?"
"In Spain, in Spain"
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire"
"Hurricanes hardly happen"
"How kind of you to let me come"
"Now once again
Where does it rain?"
"On the plain, on the plain"
"And where's that blasted plain?"
"In Spain, in Spain"
We're making fine progress, Pickering.
I think the time has come to try her out.
Are you feeling all right, Mr. Higgins?
Yes, I'm feeling fine. How are you?
-Very well, thank you.
-Good.
Let's test her in public and see how she fares.
Mr. Higgins, I was awakened by a dreadful pounding
Do you know what it might have been?
I didn't hear any pounding.
Did you, Pickering?
If this goes on, you'd better see a doctor.
-I know. We'll take her to the races.
-The races?
My mother's box at Ascot.
-You'll consult your mother first, of course.
-Yes, of course.
No, I think we'd better surprise her.
Now let's go to bed.
First thing in the morning, we'll go and buy her a dress.
Now get on with your work, Eliza.
But, Mr. Higgins, it's early in the morning.
What better time to work than early in the morning?
Where does one buy a lady's gown?
Whitely's, of course.
How do you know that?
Common knowledge.
Let's not buy her anything too flowery.
I despise those gowns with weeds here and weeds there.
We'll buy something simple and modest...
...and elegant. That's what's called for.
Perhaps with a bow.
Yes. That's just right.
You've all been working too hard.
I think the strain is beginning to show.
Eliza, I don't care what Mr. Higgins says.
You must put down your books and go to bed.
"Bed! Bed! I couldn't go to bed"
"My head's too light to try to set it down"
"Sleep! Sleep! I couldn't sleep tonight"
"Not for all the jewels in the crown!"
"l could have danced all night"
"And still have begged for more"
"l could have spread my wings"
"And done a thousand things l've never done before"
"I'll never know what made it so exciting"
"Why all at once my heart took flight"
"l only know when he"
"Began to dance with me"
"l could have danced, danced, danced..."
"...all night!"
It's after three now.
Don't you agree now?
She ought to be in bed!
"l could have danced all night"
"And still have begged for more"
"l could have spread my wings"
"And done a thousand things l've never done before"
"I'll never know what made it so exciting"
"Why all at once my heart took flight"
"l only know when he"
"Began to dance with me"
"l could have danced, danced, danced..."
"...all night!"
It's all been grand, dear.
But now it's time to sleep!
"l could have danced all night"
"And still have begged for more"
"l could have spread my wings"
"And done a thousand things l've never done before"
"I'll never know what made it so exciting"
"Why all at once my heart took flight"
"l only know when he"
"Began to dance with me"
"l could have danced, danced, danced..."
"...all night!"
"Every duke and earl and peer is here"
"Everyone who should be here is here"
"What a smashing, positively dashing"
"Spectacle, the Ascot opening day"
"At the gate are all the horses"
"Waiting for the cue to fly away"
"What a gripping, absolutely ripping"
"Moment at the Ascot opening day"
"Pulses rushing"
"Faces flushing"
"Heartbeats speed up"
"l have never been so keyed up!"
"Any second now"
"They'll begin to run"
"Hark! A bell is ringing"
"They are springing forward. Look!"
"lt has begun"
"What a frenzied moment that was"
"Didn't they maintain an exhausting pace?"
"lt was a thrilling, absolutely chilling"
"Running of the Ascot opening race!"
Mother!
Henry! What a disagreeable surprise.
Hello, Mother.
How nice you look.
What are you doing here? You promised never to come to Ascot. Go home.
I can't. I'm here on business.
You must. I'm quite serious.
You'll offend all my friends.
The moment they meet you
I never see them again.
Besides, you aren't dressed for Ascot.
I changed my shirt.
Mother, I've got a job for you.
A phonetics job. I've picked up a girl.
Not a love affair. She's a flower girl.
I'm taking her to the annual Embassy Ball but I wanted to try her out first.
-I beg your pardon?
-Well, you know the Embassy Ball.
So I invited her to your box today, do you understand?
Common flower girl?
I taught her how to speak properly.
She has strict instructions as to her behavior.
She's to keep to two subjects: the weather and everybody's health.
"Fine day! " and "How do you do?"
Not let herself go on.
Help her along. You'll be quite safe.
Safe? To talk about one's health in the middle of a race?
She's got to talk about something.
Where is the girl now?
She's being pinned. Some of the clothes we bought her didn't fit.
I told Pickering we should have taken her with us.
-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill.
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Higgins.
You know my son, Henry.
How do you do?
-I've seen you somewhere before.
-I don't know.
It doesn't matter. You better sit down.
Where the devil can they be?
Colonel Pickering, you're just in time for tea.
Thank you, Mrs. Higgins.
May I introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?
My dear Miss Doolittle.
How kind of you to let me come.
Delighted, my dear.
-Lady Boxington.
-How do you do?
-Lord Boxington.
-How do you do?
-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, Miss Doolittle.
-How do you do?
How do you do?
And Freddy Eynsford-Hill.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Miss Doolittle.
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.
The first race was very exciting,
Miss Doolittle.
I'm so sorry that you missed it.
Will it rain, do you think?
"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain."
"But in Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen."
How awfully funny.
What is wrong with that, young man?
I bet I got it right.
Smashing.
Has it suddenly turned chilly?
I do hope we won't have any unseasonable cold spells.
They bring on so much influenza.
And the whole of our family is susceptible to it.
My aunt died of influenza, so they said.
But it's my belief they done the old woman in.
Done her in?
Yes, Lord love you.
Why should she die of influenza...
...when she'd come through diphtheria right enough the year before.
Fairly blue with it she was.
They all thought she was dead.
But my father, he kept ladling gin down her throat.
Then she come to so sudden she bit the bowl off the spoon
Dear me!
Now what call would a woman with that strength in her...
...have to die of influenza?
And what become of her new straw hat that should have come to me?
Somebody pinched it.
And what I say is:
Them 'as pinched it, done her in.
Done her in? "Done her in," did you say?
Whatever does it mean?
That's the new small talk.
"To do somebody in" means to kill them.
But you surely don't believe your aunt was killed?
Do I not?
Them she lived with would have killed her for a hatpin, let alone a hat.
But it can't have been right for your father...
...to pour spirits down her throat like that.
It might have killed her.
Not her. Gin was mother's milk to her.
Besides, he poured so much down his own throat he knew the good of it.
Do you mean that he drank?
Drank? My word. Something chronic.
Here, what are you sniggering at?
The new small talk.
You do it so awfully well.
Well, if I was doing it proper, what was you sniggering at?
Have I said anything I oughtn't?
Not at all, my dear.
Well, that's a mercy anyhow.
I don't know if there's time before the next race to place a bet...
...but come, my dear.
I have a bet on number seven.
I should be so happy if you would take it.
You'll enjoy the race ever so much more.
That's very kind of you.
His name is Dover.
Come along.
"There they are again"
"Lining up to run"
"Now they're holding steady"
"They are ready for it. Look!"
"lt has begun"
Come on. Come on, Dover.
Come on, Dover!
Move your bloomin' arse!
Oh, my dear.
You're not serious, Henry. You don't expect to take her to the Embassy Ball.
Don't you think she's ready for it?
Dear Henry, she's ready for a canal barge.
Her language may need a little refining, but--
Really, Henry, if you cannot see how impossible this whole project is...
...then you must be potty about her.
I advise you to give up and not put yourself...
...or this poor girl through any more.
It's the most fascinating venture
I've ever undertaken.
Pickering and I are at it from morning till night. It fills our whole lives.
Teaching Eliza, talking to Eliza, listening to Eliza, dressing Eliza.
You're a pretty pair of babies playing with your live doll.
Here's the car.
Good evening, sir.
-Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
-Immediately, sir.
Good evening, Professor Higgins
"When she mentioned how her aunt bit off the spoon"
"She completely done me in"
"And my heart went on a journey to the moon"
"When she told about her father and the gin"
"And I never saw a more enchanting farce"
"Than the moment when she shouted
'Move your bloomin'--'"
-Yes, sir?
-Is Miss Doolittle in?
Whom shall I say is calling?
Freddy Eynsford-Hill.
If she doesn't remember who I am...
...tell her I'm the chap who was "sniggering" at her.
Yes, sir.
And will you give her these?
Wouldn't you like to come in?
They're having dinner, but you may wait in the hall.
No, thank you. I want to drink in the street where she lives.
"l have often walked down this street before"
"But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before"
"All at once am I several stories high"
"Knowing I'm on the street where you live"
"Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?"
"Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?"
"Does enchantment pour out of every door?"
"No, it's just on the street where you live"
"And, oh, the towering feeling"
"Just to know somehow you are near"
"The overpowering feeling"
"That any second you may suddenly appear"
"People stop and stare, they don't bother me"
"For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be"
"Let the time go by"
"l won't care if I"
"Can be here on the street where you live"
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
Miss Doolittle says she doesn't want to see anyone ever again.
But why? She was unbelievable.
So I've been told, sir.
Is there any further message?
Tell her that I'll wait.
But it might be days, sir, even weeks.
But don't you see? I'll be happier here.
"People stop and stare, they don't bother me"
"For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be"
"Let the time go by"
"l won't care if I"
"Can be here on the street where you live"
It really is, Higgins.
It's inhuman to continue.
Do you realize what you've got to teach this girl in six weeks?
You've got to teach her to walk, talk, address a duke, a lord...
...a bishop, an ambassador.
It's absolutely impossible.
Higgins, I'm trying to tell you that I want to call off the bet.
I know you're a stubborn man, but so am I.
This experiment is over.
And nothing short of an order from the king could force me to recant.
You understand, Higgins? It's over.
Higgins, if there's any mishap at the Embassy tonight...
...if Miss Doolittle suffers any embarrassment...
...it'll be on your head alone.
Eliza can do anything.
Suppose she's discovered?
Remember Ascot.
Suppose she makes another ghastly mistake?
There'll be no horses at the ball, Pickering.
Think of how agonizing it would be.
If anything happened tonight,
I don't know what I'd do.
You could always rejoin your regiment.
This is no time for flippancy, Higgins.
The way you've driven her the last six weeks...
...has exceeded all bounds of common decency.
For God's sake, stop pacing.
Can't you settle somewhere?
Have some port. It'll quieten your nerves.
I'm not nervous.
-Where is it?
-On the piano.
The car's here, sir.
Good. Tell Miss Doolittle.
Tell Miss Doolittle indeed.
I'll bet you that damned gown doesn't fit.
I warned you about these French designers.
We should've gone to an English shop.
They would've been on our side.
-Have a glass of port?
-No, thank you. re you so sure this girl will retain everything you've hammered into her?
Well, we shall see.
Suppose she doesn't?
I lose my bet.
There's one thing I can't stand about you, your confounded complacency.
At a moment like this, with so much at stake...
...it's utterly indecent that you don't need a glass of port.
And what about the girl? You act as though she doesn't matter at all.
Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she matters.
What do you think I've been doing all these months?
What could possibly matter more than to take a human being...
...and change her into a different human being by creating a new speech for her?
It's filling up the deepest gap that separates class from class...
...and soul from soul.
Oh, she matters immensely.
Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.
Thank you, Colonel Pickering.
Don't you think so, Higgins?
Not bad. Not bad at all.
Maestro! Maestro!
Don't you remember me?
No. Who the devil are you?
I'm your pupil. Your first, your greatest, your best pupil.
I'm Zoltan Karpathy, that marvelous boy.
I made your name famous throughout Europe.
You teach me phonetics.
You can't forget me.
Why don't you have your hair cut?
I don't have your imposing appearance, your figure, your brow.
If I had my hair cut, nobody would notice me.
Where did you get these old coins?
These are decorations for languages.
The Queen of Transylvania is here.
I'm indispensable to her at these official international parties.
I speak 32 languages.
I know everyone in Europe.
No imposter can escape my detection.
Professor Karpathy.
The Greek ambassador.
Greek, my foot!
He pretends not to know English, but he can't deceive me.
He's the son of a Yorkshire watchmaker
He speaks English so villainously that he cannot utter a word...
...without betraying his origin.
I help him pretend, but make him pay through the nose. I make them all pay.
Excuse me, sir, you are wanted upstairs.
Her Excellency asked for you.
Viscount and Viscountess Saxon.
Baron and Baroness of Yorkshire.
Sir Guy and Lady Scot-Auckland.
The Count and Countess Demereau.
The Viscount and Viscountess Hillyard.
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Lanser.
Lord and Lady Clanders.
Miss Eliza Doolittle,
Colonel Pickering.
Professor Higgins.
-Your Excellency.
-Miss Doolittle
How do you do?
-Good evening, Colonel.
-Good evening.
What an enchanting young lady you have with you this evening.
Well, who is she?
Oh, a cousin of mine. And Higgins.
Excuse me.
Professor Higgins.
Such a faraway look, as if she's always lived in a garden.
So she has. A sort of garden.
Henry gotta go home.
Here is an expert in languages.
-Sort of, you know, "imposterologist."
-I beg you pardon?
The young lady with Colonel Pickering....
Find out who she is.
With pleasure.
The whole situation is highly explosive.
Tell me, Zoltan, some more about the Greek ambassador.
Gladly, but first I would love you to present me to this glorious creature.
Does he really come from Yorkshire?
Her Majesty, the Queen of Transylvania...
...and His Royal Highness Prince Gregor.
Charming. Quite charming.
Miss Doolittle, Madam.
Miss Doolittle, my son would like to dance with you.
Absolutely fantastic.
A lot of tomfoolery.
It was an immense achievement.
Well, Mr. Higgins?
A triumph, Mrs. Pearce. A total triumph.
Higgins, you were superb, absolutely superb.
Tell us the truth now, weren't you a little bit nervous once or twice?
Not during the whole evening?
Not when I saw we were going to win.
I felt like a bear in a cage hanging about.
It was an immense achievement.
If I hadn't backed myself to do it,
I'd have given up two months ago.
Absolutely fantastic.
Yes, a lot of tomfoolery.
Higgins, I salute you.
The silly people don't know their own silly business.
"Tonight, old man, you did it
You did it, you did it"
"You said that you would do it
And indeed you did"
"l thought that you would rue it
I doubted you'd do it"
"But now I must admit it
That succeed you did"
"You should get a medal
Or be even made a knight"
"Oh, it was nothing, really nothing"
"All alone you hurdled
Every obstacle in sight"
"Now wait, now wait
Give credit where it's due"
"A lot of the glory goes to you"
"But you're the one who did it
Who did it, who did it"
"As sturdy as Gibraltar
Not a second did you falter"
"There's no doubt about it"
"You did it!"
"l must have aged a year tonight
At times I thought I'd die of fright"
"Never was there a momentary lull"
"Shortly after we came in
I saw at once we'd easily win"
"And after that I found it deadly dull"
"You should have heard
The 'oohs' and 'aahs'"
"Everyone wondering who she was"
"You'd think they'd never seen a lady before"
"And when the Prince of Transylvania
Asked to meet her"
"And gave his arm to lead her to the floor"
"l said to him: 'You did it
You did it, you did it'"
"They thought she was ecstatic
And so damned aristocratic"
"And they never knew
That you..."
"...did it"
Thank goodness for Zoltan Karpathy.
If it hadn't been for him
I would've died of boredom
Karpathy? That dreadful Hungarian?
Was he there?
Yes, he was there all right and up to his old tricks.
"That blackguard
Who uses the science of speech"
"More to blackmail and swindle than teach"
"He made it the devilish business of his"
"To find out who this Miss Doolittle is"
"Every time we looked around
There he was"
"That hairy hound from Budapest"
"Never leaving us alone
Never have I ever known"
"A ruder pest"
"Finally I decided it was foolish
Not to let him have his chance with her"
"So I stepped aside
And let him dance with her"
"Oozing charm from every pore
He oiled his way around the floor"
"Every trick that he could play
He used to strip her mask away"
"And when at last the dance was done
He glowed as if he knew he'd won"
"And with a voice too eager
And a smile too broad"
"He announced to the hostess
That she was a fraud"
No!
"Her English is too good,' he said
That clearly indicates that she is foreign"
"Whereas others are instructed
In their native language"
"English people aren't"
"Although she may have studied with an expert dialectician and grammarian"
"l can tell that she was born"
"Hungarian"
"Not only Hungarian but of royal blood"
"She is a princess"
"Her blood,' he said
Is bluer than the Danube is or ever was"
"Royalty is absolutely written on her face"
"She thought I was taken in
But actually I never was."
"How could she deceive
Another member of her race?"
"l know each language on the map"
Said he
"And she's Hungarian
As the first Hungarian Rhapsody"
"Congratulations, Professor Higgins"
"For your glorious victory"
"Congratulations, Professor Higgins"
"You'll be mentioned in history"
Well, thank God, that's over.
Now I can go to bed without dreading tomorrow.
-Good night, Mr. Higgins.
-Good night, Mrs. Pearce.
I think I'll turn in, too. Good night.
It's been a great occasion.
Good night, Pickering.
Mrs. Pearce?
Damn, I meant to ask her to give me coffee in the morning instead of tea.
Leave a little note for her will you, Eliza.
And put out the lights.
Must be downstairs. Oh, darn it.
I'll leave my head behind one of these days.
What the devil have I done with my slippers?
Here are your slippers!
Take your slippers and may you never have a day's luck with them.
What on earth? What's the matter?
Is anything wrong?
No, nothing's wrong with you.
I won your bet for you, haven't I?
That's enough for you!
I don't matter, I suppose?
You won my bet?
You presumptuous insect! I won it!!
Why did you throw the slippers at me?
Because I wanted to smash your face.
I could kill you, you selfish brute!
Why didn't you leave me where you picked me up?
You thank God it's all over. Now you can throw me back again! Do you?
Oh, so the creature's nervous after all?
Claws in, you cat!
How dare you show your temper to me?
Sit down and be quiet!
What's to become of me?
How do I know what's to become of you?
What does it matter?
You don't care. I know you don't care.
You wouldn't care if I was dead.
I'm nothing to you.
Not as much as them slippers.
Those slippers!
Those slippers! I didn't think it meant any difference now.
Why have you suddenly begun going on like this?
May I ask if you complain of your treatment here?
No.
Has anybody behaved badly?
Colonel Pickering, Mrs. Pearce?
No.
Well you don't pretend that I have treated you badly?
No.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Perhaps you're tired after the strain of the day.
Would you have a chocolate?
No, thank you.
Well, it's only natural that you should be anxious, but it's all over now.
Nothing more to worry about.
No, nothing more for you to worry about.
Oh, God, I wish I was dead.
Why? In heaven's name, why?
Now listen to me, Eliza.
All this irritation is purely subjective.
I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.
It's just imagination. Nothing's wrong.
Nobody's hurting you.
Go to bed and sleep it off.
Have a little cry and say your prayers.
You'll feel very much more comfortable..
I heard your prayers.
"Thank God it's all over."
Don't you thank God it's all over?
Now you're free, and you can do what you like.
Oh, what am I fit for?
What have you left me fit for?
Where am I to go? What am I to do?
And what's to become of me?
That's what's worrying you, is it?
I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.
I'm sure you won't have any difficulty in settling yourself somewhere or other.
I didn't quite realize you were going away.
You might marry, you know.
You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed old bachelors like me and the Colonel.
Most men are the marrying sort, poor devils.
You're not bad-looking.
You're really quite a pleasure to look at sometimes.
Not now, when you've been crying.
You look like the very devil, but...
...when you're all right and quite yourself you're what I would call attractive.
Go to bed, have a good rest, get up in the morning...
...and have a look at yourself in the glass.
You won't feel so bad.
I daresay, my mother might find some fellow or other who would do very well.
We were above that at Covent Garden.
What do you mean?
I sold flowers, I didn't sell myself.
Now you've made a lady of me,
I'm not fit to sell anything else.
Oh, tosh, Eliza.
Don't insult human relations...
...by dragging all that cant about buying and selling into it.
Don't marry the fellow if you don't want to.
What else am I to do?
Oh, there are lots of things.
What about the old idea of a florist shop?
I'm sure Pickering'd set you up in one.
He's got lots of money.
He'll pay for all those togs you're wearing.
And that with the hire of the jewelry'll make a big hole in 200 pounds.
Come on now. You'll be all right.
Well, I must be off to bed.
I'm really devilish sleepy.
I was looking for something. What was it?
Your slippers.
Oh, yes, of course. You shied them at me.
Before you go, sir.
Do my clothes belong to me or to Colonel Pickering?
What the devil use would they be to Pickering?
Why bother about that in the middle of the night?
What may I take away with me?
I don't want to be accused of stealing.
Stealing?
You shouldn't have said that.
That shows a want of feeling.
I'm sorry. I'm a common, ignorant girl and in my station I have to be careful.
There can't be any feelings between the likes of you and the likes of me.
Please, will you tell me what belongs to me and what doesn't?
Take the whole damned houseful if you want.
Except the jewelry. That's hired.
Will that satisfy you?
Stop, please.
Will you take these to your room and keep them safe?
I don't want to run the risk of them being missed.
Hand them over! If these belonged to me and not the jeweler, I'd...
...l'd ram them down your ungrateful throat.
The ring isn't the jeweler's.
It's the one you bought me in Brighton.
I don't want it now.
Don't you hit me!
Hit you? You infamous creature!
How dare you suggest such a thing!
It's you who've hit me.
You've wounded me to the heart.
I'm glad. I've got a little of my own back anyhow.
You've caused me to lose my temper.
That's hardly happened to me before.
I don't wish to discuss it further tonight.
I'm going to bed.
Leave your own note for Mrs. Pearce about the coffee..
...for it won't be done by me!
Damn Mrs. Pearce, damn the coffee and damn you!
Damn my own folly for having lavished my hard-earned knowledge...
...and the treasure of my regard and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe!
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins
Just you wait!"
"You'll be sorry
But your tears will be too late"
"You will be the one it's done to"
"And you'll have no one to run to"
"Just you wait"
"l have often walked down this street before"
"But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before"
"All at once am I several stories high"
"Knowing I'm on the street where you live"
"Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?"
"Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?"
"Does enchantment pour out of every door?"
"No, it's just on the street where you live"
"And, oh, the towering feeling"
"Just to know somehow you are near"
"The overpowering feeling"
"That any second you may suddenly appear"
"People stop and stare, they don't...."
Darling.
Freddy, whatever are you doing here?
Nothing. I spend most of my nights here.
It's the only place where I'm happy.
Don't laugh at me, Miss Doolittle.
Don't you call me "Miss Doolittle," do you hear? Eliza's good enough for me.
Freddy, you don't think
I'm a heartless guttersnipe, do you?
Darling, how could you imagine such a thing? You know how I feel.
I've written two and three times a day telling you. Sheets and sheets.
"Speak, and the world is full of singing"
"And I am winging higher than the birds"
"Touch, and my heart begins to crumble"
"The heavens tumble
Darling, and I'm--"
"Words, words, words
I'm so sick of words"
"l get words all day through
First from him, now from you"
"ls that all you blighters can do?
"Don't talk of stars burning above"
"If you're in love, show me"
"Tell me no dreams filled with desire"
"If you're on fire, show me"
"Here we are together
In the middle of the night"
"Don't talk of spring
Just hold me tight"
"Anyone who's ever been in love'll
Tell you that"
"This is no time for a chat"
"Haven't your lips longed for my touch?"
"Don't say how much, show me"
"Don't talk of love lasting through time"
"Make me no undying vow"
"Show me now"
"Sing me no song, read me no rhyme"
"Don't waste my time, show me"
"Don't talk of June, don't talk of fall"
"Don't talk at all, show me"
"Never do I ever want to hear another word"
"There isn't one I haven't heard"
"Here we are together in what ought to be a dream"
"Say one more word and I'll scream"
"Haven't your arms hungered for mine?"
"Please don't explain, show me"
"Don't wait until wrinkles and lines"
"Pop out all over my brow
Show me now!"
-Where are you going?
-To the river.
-What for?
-To make a hole in it.
Eliza, darling, what do you mean?
-But I've no money.
-I have.
-Where are we going?
-Where I belong.
Darling, shall I come with you?
"With one enormous chair"
"Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?"
"Lots of chocolate for me to eat"
"Lots of coal makin' lots of 'eat"
"Warm face, warm 'ands, warm feet
"Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?"
Buy a flower, miss?
Yes, please.
Good morning, miss. Can I help you?
Do you mind if I warm my hands?
Go right ahead, miss.
Excuse me. For a second
I thought you were somebody else.
Who?
Forgive me, ma'am. Early morning light playing tricks with my eyes.
Can I get you a taxi?
A lady shouldn't be walkin' alone...
...around London this hour of the morning.
No, thank you.
"Someone's head restin' on my knee"
"Warm and tender as he can be"
"Who takes good care of me"
"Oh, wouldn't it..."
"...be loverly?
Loverly"
Do come again, Mr. Doolittle.
We value your patronage always.
Thank you, my good man. Thank you.
Here. Come 'ere.
Take the missus on a trip to Brighton with my compliments.
Thank you, Mr Doolittle.
Jolly spot this, Harry.
We must visit it more often.
Father?
Oh, no. You see, Harry, he has no mercy.
Sent her down to spy on me in me misery, he did. Me own flesh and blood.
Well, I'm miserable, all right.
You can tell him that straight.
What are you talking about?
What are you dressed up for?
As if you didn't know.
Go on back to that Wimpole Street devil.
Tell him what he's done to me.
What's he done to you?
Ruined me, that's all.
Tied me up and delivered me into the hands of middle-class morality.
And don't you defend him.
Was it 'im or was it not 'im wrote to an old
American blighter named Wallingford..
...who was giving $5,000,000 to found Moral Reform societies...
...to tell him the most original moralist in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...
...a common dustman?
Sounds like one of his jokes.
You may call it a joke.
It's put the lid on me. Proper.
The old bloke died and left me
4,000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.
Who asked him to make a gentleman outta me? I was 'appy. I was free.
I touched pretty nigh everyone for money when I wanted it, same as I touched him.
Now I'm tied neck and 'eels and everybody touches me.
A year ago I 'adn't a relation in the world...
...except one or two who wouldn't speak to me.
Now I've 50. Not a decent week's wages amongst the lot of them.
I have to live for others now, not for meself. Middle-class morality.
Come on, Alfie, in a few hours we have to be at the church.
-Church?
-Yeah, church.
The deepest cut of all.
Why do you think I'm dressed up like a ruddy pallbearer?
Your stepmother wants to marry me.
Now I'm respectable, she wants to be respectable.
If that's the way you feel, why don't you give the money back?
That's the tragedy of it, Eliza.
It's easy to say chuck it...
...but I 'aven't the nerve.
We're all intimidated.
That's what we are, intimidated.
Bought up. Yeah. That's what I am.
That's what your precious professor's brought me to.
Not my precious professor.
Oh, sent you back, 'as he?
First he shoves me in the middle-class, then he chucks you out for me to support.
That's all part of his plan...
...but you double-cross him.
Don't you come back home to me.
Don't you take tuppence from me.
You stand on your own two feet.
You're a lady now, you can do it
Yeah, that's right, Eliza.
You're a lady now.
It's getting awfully cold in that taxi.
Here, Eliza, would you like to come and see me turned off this morning?
St. George's, Hanover Square, 10:00.
I wouldn't advise it, but you're welcome.
No, thank you, Dad.
Are you all finished here, Eliza?
Yes, Freddy, I'm all finished here.
Good luck, Dad.
Thank you, Eliza.
Come along, Alfie.
How much time have I got left?
"There's just a few more hours"
"That's all the time you've got"
"A few more hours"
"Before they tie the knot"
There's drinks and girls all over London.
And I gotta track 'em down in just a few more hours.
Set 'em up, me darlin'.
"l'm gettin' married in the mornin'"
"Ding dong, the bells are gonna chime"
"Pull out the stopper
Let's have a whopper"
"But get me to the church on time"
"l got to be there in the mornin'"
"Spruced up and looking in me prime"
"Girls, come and kiss me
Show how you'll miss me"
"But get me to the church on time"
"If I am dancin'
Roll up the floor"
"If I am whistlin'
Me out the door"
"For I'm getting married in the mornin'"
"Ding dong, the bells are gonna chime"
"Kick up a rumpus
But don't lose the compass"
"And get me to the church"
"For God's sake
Get me to the church...
...on time"
"l'm gettin' married in the mornin'"
"Ding dong, the bells are gonna chime"
"Some bloke who's able
Lift up the table"
"But get me to the church on time"
"If I am flyin'
Then shoot me down"
"If I am wooin'
Get her out of town"
"For I'm getting married in the mornin'"
"Ding dong, the bells are gonna chime"
"Feather and tar me
Call out the Army"
"But get me to the church"
"Get me to the church"
...on time"
"Pull out the stopper
Let's have a whopper"
''Girls, come and kiss me
Show how you'll miss me"
"But get me to the church on time"
"If l am dancin'
Roll up the floor"
"If l am whistlin'
Me out the door"
"Drug me or jail me
Stamp me and mail me"
"But get me to the church"
"Get him to the church"
"For God's sake
Get me to the church on time"
"Some bloke who's able
Lift up the table"
"But get me to the church on time"
"Starlight is reelin'
Home to bed now"
"Mornin' is smearin' up the sky"
"London is wakin'"
"Daylight is breakin'"
"Good luck, old chum"
"Good health"
"Goodbye"
"l'm gettin' married in the mornin'"
"Ding dong, the bells are gonna chime"
"Hail and salute me
Then haul off and boot me"
"For God's sake
Get him to the church on time"
Didn't she say where to send her clothes?
I told you, sir, she took them all with her.
Here's a confounded thing. Eliza's bolted.
Last night Mrs. Pearce let her go without telling me about it!
What'll I do? I got tea this morning instead of coffee.
I don't know where anything is, what my appointments are.
-Eliza'd know.
-Damn it, she's gone!
Did either of you frighten her last night?
We hardly said a word to her.
You were there.
Did you bully her after I went to bed?
She threw the slippers at me.
I never gave her the slightest provocation.
The slippers came at my head before I uttered a word.
She used the most disgraceful language.
I was shocked! I don't understand.
We always gave her every consideration.
She admitted it.
I'm dashed!
Pickering, for God's sake, stop being dashed and do something!
Phone the police. What are they there for?
You can't give Eliza's name to the police...
...as if she were a thief or a lost umbrella.
But why not? I want to find the girl.
She belongs to me.
I paid five pounds for her.
Quite right. Hello. Scotland Yard, please?
Get me some coffee, would you please?
Scotland Yard?
This is Colonel Pickering speaking.
27A Wimpole Street.
I want to report a missing person.
Miss Eliza Doolittle.
About 21.
I should say about 5 foot 7.
Her eyes? Let me think now. Her eyes....
-Brown.
-Brown.
Her hair? Good Lord.
Sort of a nondescript neutral sort of--
Brown, brown, brown!
You heard what he said?
Brown, brown, brown, yes.
No. This is her residence. 27A--
Yes, about between 3:00 and 4:00 this morning, I understand.
No.... She's no relation, no.
Well, let's call her a good friend, shall we?
I beg your pardon?
Listen to me, I don't like the tenor of that question.
What the girl does here is our affair.
Your affair is to get her back so she can continue doing it.
Well, I'm dashed!
"What in heaven could have prompted her to go?"
"After such a triumph at the ball"
"What could have depressed her?"
"What could have possessed her?
I cannot understand the wretch at all"
Higgins, I have an old school chum at the Home Office. Perhaps he could help.
Think I'll give him a ring.
Whitehall: 7244, please.
"Women are irrational
That's all there is to that"
"Their heads are full of
Cotton, hay and rags"
"They're nothing but exasperating lrritating, vacillating, calculating"
"Agitating, maddening
And infuriating hags"
I want to speak to Mr. Brewster Budgin, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
Pickering, why can't a woman be more like a man?
I beg your pardon?
Yes, why can't a woman be more like a man?
"Men are so honest, so thoroughly square
"Eternally noble, historically fair"
"Who, when you win
Will always give your back a pat?"
"Why can't a woman be like that?"
"Why does every one do
What the others do?"
"Can't a woman learn to use her head?"
"Why do they do everything
Their mothers do?"
"Why don't they grow up
Well, like their father instead?"
"Why can't a woman take after a man?"
"Men are so pleasant, so easy to please"
"Whenever you're with them
You're always at ease"
"Would you be slighted
If I didn't speak for hours?"
"Would you be livid
If I had a drink or two?"
"Would you be wounded
If I never sent you flowers?"
"Well, why can't a woman be like you?"
"One man in a million may shout a bit"
"Now and then
There's one with slight defects"
"One perhaps whose truthfulness
You doubt a bit"
"But by and large
We are a marvelous sex"
"Why can't a woman take after a man?"
"Cause men are so friendly
Good-natured and kind"
"A better companion
You never will find"
"If I were hours late for dinner
Would you bellow?"
"If I forgot your silly birthday
Would you fuss?"
"Would you complain
If I took out another fellow?"
"Well, why can't a woman be like us?"
Is Mr. Brewster Budgin there?
Bruzzie, you'll never guess who this is.
You're quite right, it is. Good heavens.
By George, what a memory.!
How are you, Bruzzie?
Nice to hear your voice.
What? You don't say.
Has it really been 30 years, Bruzzie?
Right. Yes, oceans of water
Listen, Bruzzie, I'll tell you why I rang up.
Something rather unpleasant has happened. Could I come and see you?
I could, yes. Now, straight away?
Right. Good. Thank you.
Goodbye, Bruzzie. Thank you very much.
Mrs. Pearce, I'm going along to the Home Office.
I do hope you find her, Colonel Pickering.
Mr. Higgins will miss her.
Mr. Higgins will miss her, eh?
Blast Mr. Higgins, I'll miss her
-Mrs. Pearce?
-Yes, sir.
Where's the Colonel?
He's gone to the Home Office, sir.
There you are. I'm disturbed and he runs for help. Now there's a good fellow..
Mrs. Pearce, you're a woman.
"Why can't a woman be more like a man?"
"Men are so decent
Such regular chaps"
"Ready to help you
Through any mishaps"
"Ready to buck you up
Whenever you are glum"
"Why can't a woman be a chum?"
"Why is thinking
Something women never do?"
"And why is logic never even tried?"
"Straightening up their hair ls all they ever do"
"Why don't they straighten up
The mess that's inside?"
"Why can't a woman behave like a man?"
"If I was a woman
Who'd been to a ball"
"Been hailed as a princess
By one and by all"
"Would I start weeping
Like a bathtub overflowing?"
"Or carry on as if my home were in a tree?"
"Would I run off
And never tell me where I'm going?"
"Why can't a woman be like me?"
You mean that after you'd done this wonderful thing for them...
...without making a mistake...
...they just sat there and never said a word?
Never petted you, or admired you, or told you how splendid you'd been?
Not a word.
They just congratulated each other on how marvelous they'd been.
The next moment, how glad they were it was all over...
...and what a bore it had all been.
This is appalling. I should not have thrown my slippers at him.
I should have thrown the fire irons.
Who's that?
Henry. I knew it wouldn't be too long.
Now, remember...
...you not only danced with a prince last night, you behaved like a princess.
Mother, the most confounded thing....
Do you--
You!
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.
Are you quite well?
Of course you are. You are never ill.
Would you care for some tea?
Don't you dare try that game on me.
I taught it to you.
Get up, come home and stop being a fool.
You've caused me enough trouble.
Very nicely put indeed, Henry.
No woman could resist such an invitation.
How did this baggage get here?
Eliza came to see me this morning and I was delighted to have her.
If you don't promise to behave yourself
I'll ask you to leave.
I'm to put on my Sunday manners for this...
...thing that I created out of the squashed cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?
That's precisely what I mean.
I'll see her damned first.
However did you learn good manners with my son around?
It was very difficult. I should never have known how ladies and gentlemen behave...
...if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.
He showed me that he felt and thought about me...
...as if I were something better than a common flower girl.
You see, Mrs. Higgins, apart from the things one can pick up...
...the difference between a lady and a flower girl isn't how she behaves...
...but how she is treated.
For Professor Higgins,
I will always be a florist ...
...because he always treats me as a flower girl and always will.
I'll always be a lady to Colonel Pickering...
...because he always treats me as a lady and always will.
Henry, don't grind your teeth.
The bishop is here.
Shall I show him into the garden?
The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no!
I should be excommunicated.
I'll see him in the library.
Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things...
...l give you full permission to have him evicted.
Henry, I suggest you stick to two subjects: the weather and your health.
You've had a bit of your own back, as you say.
Have you had enough and will you be reasonable or do you want any more?
You want me back to pick up your slippers...
...and put up with your tempers and fetch and carry for you.
I didn't say I wanted you back at all.
Then what are we talking about?
Well, about you, not about me.
If you come back you'll be treated as you always have.
I can't change my nature or my manners.
My manners are exactly the same as Colonel Pickering's.
That's not true. He treats a flower girl as if she were a duchess.
I treat a duchess as if she was a flower girl.
I see. The same to everybody.
The great secret is not a question of good manners...
...or bad manners or any particular sort of manner...
...but having the same manner for all human souls.
The question is not whether I treat you rudely...
...but whether you've ever heard me treat anyone else better.
I don't care how you treat me.
I don't mind your swearing at me.
I shouldn't mind a black eye.
I've had one before this.
But I won't be passed over
Get out of my way, for I won't stop for you.
You talk about me as though
I was a motorbus.
So you are a motorbus. All bounce and go and no consideration for anybody.
But I can get along without you.
Don't you think I can't!
I know you can. I told you, you could.
You've never wondered, I suppose, whether...
...whether I could get along without you?
Don't you try to get around me.
You'll have to.
So I can, without you or any soul on earth.
I shall miss you, Eliza. I've learned something from your idiotic notions.
I confess that humbly and gratefully. ell, you have my voice on your gramophone.
When you feel lonely without me you can turn it on. It has no feelings to hurt.
Well, I can't turn your soul on.
You are a devil!
You can twist the heart in a girl just as easily..
...as some can twist her arms to hurt her.
What am I to come back for?
For the fun of it. That's why I took you on.
You may throw me out tomorrow if I don't do everything you want.
Yes. And you may walk out tomorrow if I don't do everything you want
And live with my father?
Yes, or sell flowers.
Would you rather marry Pickering?
I wouldn't marry you if you asked me and you're nearer my age then what he is.
-Than he is.
-I'll talk as I like, you're not my teacher
That's not what I want and don't you think it is.
I've always had chaps enough wanting me that way..
Freddy Hill writes me twice and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.
In short, you want me to be as infatuated about you as he is, is that it?
No, I don't. That's not the sort of feeling
I want from you.
I want a little kindness.
I know I'm a common, ignorant girl, and you're a book-learned gentleman...
...but I'm not dirt under your feet.
What I done...what I did was not for the taxis and the dresses...
...but because we were pleasant together and I come to...came...
...to care for you.
Not to want you to make love to me...
...and not forgetting the difference between us, but...
...more friendly like.
Well, of course. That's how I feel.
And how Pickering feels.
Eliza, you're a fool!
That's not the proper answer.
It's the only answer till you stop being an idiot.
To be a lady, you must stop feeling neglected...
...if men don't spend half their time sniveling over you...
...and the other half giving you black eyes.
You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish, don't you?
Off with you to the sort of people you like.
Marry a sentimental hog with lots of money...
...and thick lips to kiss you, and thick boots to kick you.
If you can't appreciate what you have, then get what you can appreciate.
I can't talk to you.
You always turn everything against me.
I'm always in the wrong.
Don't be too sure you have me under your feet...
...to be trampled on and talked down.
I'll marry Freddy, I will, as soon as I'm able to support him.
The poor devil who couldn't get a job as an errand boy...
...even if he had the guts to try?
Don't you understand?
I have made you a consort for a king!
Freddy loves me.
That makes him king enough for me.
I don't want him to work.
He wasn't brought up to do it as I was.
I'll go and be a teacher.
What'll you teach, in heaven's name?
What you taught me. I'll teach phonetics.
I'll offer myself as an assistant to that brilliant Hungarian.
What, that imposter? That humbug?
That toadying ignoramus?
Teach him my methods, my discoveries
You take one step in that direction,
I'll wring your neck!
Wring away! What do I care?
I knew you'd strike me one day.
That's done you, 'Enry 'lggins, it 'as.
Now, I don't care for your bullyin' an' your big talk.
"What a fool I was"
"What a dominated fool"
"To think you were the earth and sky"
"What a fool I was"
"What an addle-pated fool"
"What a mutton-headed dolt was I"
"No, my reverberating friend"
"You are not the beginning and the end"
You impudent hussy!
There's not an idea in your head or a word in your mouth that I haven't put there.
"There'll be spring every year without you"
"England still will be here without you"
"There'll be fruit on the tree
And a shore by the sea"
"There'll be crumpets and tea without you"

"Somehow Keats will survive without you"
"And there still will be rain
On that plain down in Spain"
"Even that will remain without you"
"l can do without you"
"You, dear friend"
"Who talk so well"
"You can go to"
"Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire"
"They can still rule the land without you"
"Windsor Castle will stand without you"

We can all muddle through"
"Without you!"
You brazen hussy!

"l said I'd make a woman and succeed I did"
Eliza, you're magnificent.
Five minutes ago you were a millstone around my neck...
...and now you're a tower of strength.
A consort battleship.
I like you this way.
Goodbye, Professor Higgins.
You shall not be seeing me again.
Mother!
What is it, Henry? What's happened?
She's gone.
Well, of course, dear.
What did you expect?
What am I to do?
Do without, I suppose.
And so I shall.
If the Higgins' oxygen burns up her little lungs...
...let her seek some stuffiness that suits her.
She's an owl sickened by a few days of my sunshine.
Let her go. I can do without her.
I can do without anyone.
I have my own soul!
-My own spark of divine fire!
-Bravo, Eliza.
"Damn, damn, damn, damn"
"l've grown accustomed to her face"
"She almost makes the day begin"
"l've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon"
"Her smiles, her frowns
Her ups, her downs"
"Are second nature to me now"
"Like breathing out and breathing in"
"l was serenely independent and content
Before we met"
"Surely I could always be that way again"
"And yet I've grown
Accustomed to her looks"
"Accustomed to her voice"
"Accustomed to her face"
Marry Freddy.
What an infantile idea. What a heartless, wicked, brainless thing to do.
But she'll regret it. She'll regret it.
It's doomed before they even take the vow!
"l can see her now
Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill"
"In a wretched little flat above a store"
"l can see her now, not a penny in the till"
"And a bill collector beating at the door"
"She'll try to teach the things I taught her"
"And end up selling flowers instead"
"Begging for her bread and water"
"While her husband has his breakfast in bed"
"In a year or so when she's prematurely gray"
"And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk"
"She'll come home and lo he'll have upped and run away"
"With a social-climbing heiress from New York"
"Poor Eliza"
"How simply frightful"
"How humiliating"
"How delightful"
"How poignant it will be
On that inevitable night"
"When she hammers on my door
In tears and rags"
"Miserable and lonely
Repentant and contrite"
"Will I take her in
Or hurl her to the wolves?"
"Give her kindness
Or the treatment she deserves?"
"Will I take her back
Or throw the baggage out?"
"Well, I'm a most forgiving man"
"The sort who never could, ever would"
"Take a position and staunchly never budge"
"A most forgiving man"
"But I shall never take her back"
"If she were crawling on her knees"
"Let her promise to atone
Let her shiver, let her moan"
"l'll slam the door
And let the hellcat freeze"
Marry Freddy.
"But I'm so used to hear her say"
"Good morning' every day
"Her joys, her woes"
"Her highs, her lows"
"Are second nature to me now"
"Like breathing out and breathing in"
"l'm very grateful she's a woman
And so easy to forget"
"Rather like a habit one can always break"
"And yet I've grown
Accustomed to the trace"
"Of something in the air"
"Accustomed to her face"
Oh, we are proud. He ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im. I 'eard 'im say so.
I ain't come here to ask for any compliment...
...and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.
Good enough for what?
Good enough for you.
Now you know, don't ya?
I'm come to 'ave lessons.
And to pay for 'em, too...
...make no mistake.
What do you want, my girl?
I want to be a lady in a flow'r shop,
'stead o' sellin'...
...at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.
But they won't take me unless I can talk more genteel. He said he could teach me.
Well, 'ere I am ready to pay. Not askin' any favor, and he treats me as if I was dirt.
I know what lessons cost as well as you do and I'm ready to pay.
I won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave it.
It's almost irresistible.
She's so deliciously low.
So horribly dirty. I'll take it.
I'll make a duchess of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.
I washed my face and 'ands before I come, I did.
Where the devil are my slippers?
Boss, they just stopped a customer from betting a roll of these. Why?
Why? Because that's Confederate money.
Money's money, ain't it?
Blackie, I don't know what I'd do without you.
-You'd manage.
-Thanks.
Escort the gentleman gently to the deck and kick him down the gangplank.
No more bets.
You seen Johnny? It's nearly showtime.
Yeah, he made his daily contribution.
He went that way.
-The rabbit's foot didn't help?
-Help?
He lost that, too.
Okay, new shooter. Come on out.
Johnny?
Twelve straight times he drew cards to 12, on account of today is the 12th.
He didn't even win once?
With me dealing?
-Piano player.
-Yes, Mr. Braden.
Try to play the notes the way they're written.
I'll use both hands.
And if Johnny is late again,
I hope he can dance with a broken leg.
That's what I like about you, boss.
Always ready with a pat on the back.
Place your bets.
-You seen Johnny?
-Look under the nearest pair of dice.
-Don't you even say hello to your wife?
-Hello, wife.
Peg, how can I get Johnny to give up gambling?
Easy. A bullet in the head, poison in his coffee, a fatal knife wound.
Nothing to it.
Where have you been?
I lost your trail at the blackjack table.
Ran into a guy who told me about a gypsy fortuneteller.
She's got a hot cup of tea leaves.
I'm a coffee man myself.
What happened with your astrologer?
Couldn't read the stars on a cloudy night?
-You got to have faith, Cully.
-And money.
-How much did you lose tonight?
-How much did I have?
That's what you lost last night.
You're holding your own.
Seven years bad luck.
-It was already cracked.
-Okay, only five.
Be over before you know it.
Say, five. That's a hunch. Loan me $5.
I can't afford you much longer.
-Put the $5 on number 5.
-I'll lose my job if I'm late.
I'll lose my confidence if I pass up a hunch bet.
Hello, Johnny.
Hello, Johnny.
Say goodbye, Johnny.
They're wearing mittens out there tonight.
-They just don't appreciate talent.
-No.
-On stage for the Petunia number.
-Always brings me luck, you know.
You need a new horseshoe.
I've got a gal
Oh, what a pal
The apple of my eye
We're something rare
A peach of a pair
But her dad won't let us meet and I could die
I love Petunia
The gardener's daughter
Oh, how that gal can kiss
My eyes are blue as bluebells
Each cheek a rose to see
How I dance when she plants her two lips on me
He's as daffy as a daffodil
He loves to kiss me all the time
Tonight I'll steal into her garden
And make Petunia's two lips mine
She makes other girls look just like weeds
I wanna be his clinging vine
Tonight I'll steal into her garden
And make Petunia's two lips
My ever-loving two lips
Make Petunia's two lips mine
-What were those signals?
-What signals?
Between you and Cully. I'm not blind.
Those signals. Nothing.
He just made a little bet for me.
Now you've got helpers.
Can't you lose fast enough alone?
-Where're you going?
-To have my head examined.
-There must be a hole in it.
-You can't help it if you're in love.
You're born losers, both of you!
-What's the matter with her?
-She's crazy about the wrong guy. Me.
I am a loser.
But if I had $20, I could be a winner.
I hate myself for asking, but how?
This gypsy fortuneteller parked across the river,
I hear everyone who takes her advice is getting rich.
-So how come she lives in a wagon?
-The wagon is loaded with gold.
You got $20?
Lucky for you, it just so happens...
You are the lowest person that ever lived.
-Peg, my sweetheart, you've missed me.
-You're not what I've missed.
-No?
-No!
I've missed the $50
I hid in my winter lingerie.
You know, I never could keep out of your...
You didn't have to stab me.
I should've listened to my sainted mother.
She said you were just like my father.
I could never drink that much.
Don't you dare say one word about my drunken old man.
-Where's the money?
-I lost it, Peg, all of it. Honest.
-And he loaned me the last $5.
-Now you stay out of this.
Just to convince me, you take off your shoes.
-My shoes?
-Off!
Love and trust.
That's what makes a marriage great.
See? I could never lie to you.
Well, there's a $10 lie.
-Now, how did that get in there?
-I wonder.
Goodbye, gypsy.
Hello, Zolita.
Business is awful.
Why don't you have a talk with your crystal ball?
Maybe these are two live ones.
What shall I promise them?
A long journey or sudden wealth?
As long as it costs you nothing, give them both.
Gentlemen, you have come to the right place.
The one, the only, the incomparable Zolita.
The kid's got problems.
Keeps breaking mirrors and walking under black cats.
Yes, my son, you look troubled. Deeply troubled.
No, it's worse than that.
I can't break my losing streak.
You are a gambling man.
Every cent I make.
I could sure use some motherly advice.
Mother Zolita can only interpret, my son.
Perhaps the tea leaves will forecast failure, perhaps success.
I am merely a princess with a rare gift handed down from generation to generation.
-Didn't I tell you she was great?
-She hasn't said anything yet.
The leaves are ready to speak.
No lemon?
The tea leaves have spoken.
If you do not mind, I work alone.
What do they spell, Mother?
How lucky you are.
The wheel of fortune has stopped at your number.
-A wheel? That's roulette.
-And I see a dice table, too.
No blackjack? This boy plays all games.
And a new woman is coming into your life.
Beautiful young redhead.
It can't be a redhead, Princess.
My girl's a blonde.
Take another look.
Now I see a blonde.
But she has been bad luck for you.
The tea leaves say you will have good luck with the redhead.
I know better. I married one.
Take the advice of a 20-year loser.
-No redheads.
-He must not defy the tea leaves.
How're you gonna explain her to Frankie?
Why explain?
We'll just use her to make a bundle.
You're going to pass off a beautiful redhead as a good-luck piece?
Good luck.
-If I may be so crude...
-Sure.
If you please, the princess never soils her royal hands with money.
When the tea leaves promise a beautiful redhead, it is $20.
A lot of money for a cup of tea.
That's a gypsy for you.
Takes all your dough, so you can't take her advice.
Minor problems like that I cannot solve.
Maybe you can get another advance from Braden.
Not a chance.
I'm already in for five weeks' salary.
That you lost right back into his pocket.
Braden's got a nice little thing going there.
Don't worry.
Did you ever know a gambler who couldn't promote some betting money?
-You also need chesay.
-Chesay? Who's that?
Chesay is gypsy good luck. Lazlo!
Drink a cup of gypsy luck
Just tip it up
And then you just say chesay
Swallow once then swallow twice
Goes down so nice
Just say chesay, hey!
What's in the drink, chase the devil away?
Lightning, I think, so just say chesay
Chesay, chesay
Brings you good luck night and day
Chesay, chesay
That's the gypsy way
Trouble is my middle name
Though it's such a crying shame
Try and try, there's nothing I can do
But I'm feeling kinda strange
Feel like things are gonna change
Time my lucky star was shining through
Chesay, chesay
Brings you good luck night and day
Chesay, chesay
That's the gypsy way
Drink a cup of gypsy luck
Just tip it up
And then you just say chesay
Swallow once then swallow twice
Goes down so nice
Just say chesay, hey!
What's in the drink, chase the devil away?
Magic, I think, so just say chesay
Chesay, chesay
Brings you good luck night and day
Chesay, chesay
That's the gypsy way
Chesay, chesay
Brings you good luck night and day
Chesay, chesay
That's the gypsy way
Chesay, chesay
Brings you good luck night and day
Chesay, chesay
That's the gypsy way, chesay
Have you seen Cully?
He's been missing for an hour.
-Tried the Lost and Found Department?
-No, I'm afraid they'll find him.
I always know where to find Johnny.
In the casino, losing his shirt.
With the way the other girls look at him, you're lucky he isn't playing around.
You know what I'd do if he ever did me wrong?
-Shoot yourself?
-No, him.
One last request before I cross the great footlights up yonder.
Like what?
Like, would you loan me $25 so I can pay Cully what I owe him?
Cully loaned you $25? Where did he get it?
Between my nightgown and my petticoat.
Do you know how much you owe me already?
Who's counting?
You sure you don't want this money to gamble?
Word of honor, cross my heart, and may you never kiss me again.
You sound sincere.
What would you do, Peg?
What any woman with an ounce of pride or self-respect would do.
Give him the money.
Greatest little bank in America.
Two greatest little banks in America.
What a shame you don't have an account there.
$15, $20, $25. Makes us even, right?
I didn't think you'd get a dime from Frankie.
-How much you got left to play with?
-I'm broke.
But I got a rich friend who will loan me...
-You better count it to be sure it's all there.
-What for? I trust you.
Now all we need is a beautiful redhead.
Nellie!
Nellie Bly!
Hello, Blackie.
You look great.
How did New York treat you?
They didn't believe my billing,
"The Singing Queen of the Riverboats."
-How's the action?
-The boss never had it rolling in so fast.
Money isn't everything, but it never made a man look less attractive.
-Put those in my old room, will you, Mac?
-Does Mr. Braden know you're back?
No, I want to surprise him.
Is he in his office?
You don't want to surprise him now.
Why don't you go in and win a few bucks until he spruces up for you?
Who is she?
That's not nice.
Has Mr. Braden ever cheated on you?
-Well, has he?
-Still protecting him, aren't you?
Why not?
Who bailed me out and got me a job?
And who made a gentleman out of me?
And who...
Okay. Go ring the fire bell.
Tell Braden I'll meet him in the casino after I pretty up for him.
Are you really going to make me a star, Mr. Braden?
It's not me that'll do it, Mitzi.
It's your talent.
I do have talent, don't I?
You're loaded with it.
Boss, you got one girl too many.
Nellie Bly just came aboard.
When you've got a message like that, whisper.
Nellie's in the casino waiting for you.
She doesn't know about you and Mitzi.
It's happened to me again?
I don't get my name in lights?
You just don't have the talent, Mitzi.
But a minute ago, you said...
The only woman who ever gave me bubbles, like that champagne, just came back.
And she's funny.
She thinks three is a crowd.
Why, you...
Hi, Mitzi.
-The boss in a bad mood again?
-Bad?
He never felt better.
His favorite girl came back.
I thought you were.
I just found out
I've been understudying the part.
In my next life, I hope I'm not a girl.
I could never go through that again.
-Twenty-six, black. Even.
-Let's try another table.
All blondes. I can't go against Zolita.
You're too darn particular.
The gypsy said a redhead, and a redhead it's gotta be.
Then we're wasting our time here.
Seven blondes. Not one redhead.
Seven. That's a hunch bet if ever I heard one.
-One stack, please.
-I'll tell the gypsy on you.
-Place your bets.
-On seven.
-No, lady. That's the kiss of death.
-I'm sorry.
Off seven.
Hold it, Johnny.
Maybe that's your lucky redhead.
-Are you?
-The action's over there.
No more bets.
Seven. A winner. Red.
Thirty-five times twenty.
You would've won $700!
If she can do it once, she can do it again.
Are you a real redhead?
I'm a real everything.
-What's your lucky number?
-One.
-One at a time.
-One it is.
Would you mind giving them your magic touch?
Just for luck.
You better get the bottom one, too.
Place your bets.
By this time tomorrow, this ship should be the S.S. Johnny.
-What's your name, lucky?
-Nellie Bly.
-Welcome aboard.
-That's it, Bly!
I need a name to rhyme with "eye" for a new song I'm writing.
Now I got it. Nellie Bly.
-You're gonna be made famous in a song.
-I've tried every other way.
I don't even have to look.
I know it's going to be number one.
One, red!
-Maybe that gypsy knew something.
-Maybe? My future just got here.
-Place your bets.
-This is the big break I've been...
-Where'd she go? It was going good.
-What about these chips?
Keep counting. I'll be right back.
Nellie, it's been a long year without you.
You never looked better.
You have.
Who's been keeping you up nights?
Who can remember names?
-What kind of a kiss is that?
-We're not starting where we left off.
I like a girl who remembers the good things in life.
I thought you came back because you missed me.
I came back because
I wasn't good enough for Broadway.
I'm big in the small time and small in the big time.
You'll always be my star attraction.
What about the girl last week?
And the girl before her, and the one before...
-A man gets lonely.
-Lonely enough to get married?
You're not going to bring up marriage again?
-My mother recommends it highly.
-Your mother doesn't know me.
What would you do if I got big eyes for someone else?
-Nothing.
-Nothing?
I might arrange to have his neck broken, but outside of that, nothing. Come here.
Boss. One of the customers wants to raise the limit.
-How's he doing?
-Big loser.
Losers we always accommodate.
Don't shuffle the cards. I'll be right back.
-You can't do that to me.
-Hello again.
-Do what?
-Disappear.
You may not believe this, but our meeting tonight was no accident.
-The gypsy sent you.
-Gypsy?
Who believes in them?
I do.
This fortuneteller told me a gorgeous redhead would come into my life.
That'd be the luckiest thing to happen to me.
I'm a gorgeous rabbit's foot, is that it?
-You don't know how badly I need you.
-Tell me more.
Hello, boss.
-I finally found my good-luck charm.
-Did you, now?
Sure. With Nellie beside me, I'll break every casino here before I'm through.
You're through now.
Didn't you tell him who you are?
I don't even know who he is.
Well, allow me.
Johnny, my number one girl, Nellie Bly.
How about that?
She means a lot to both of us.
-She's private stock, all 120 pounds of her.
Weren't you due on stage five minutes ago?
Ten.
Forget it, Nellie. He's spoken for.
Yes, but I'm not.
To show you how worried I am, let's go hear lover boy sing.
Wise men have known
Women can't live alone
So a woman should understand
That what every woman lives for
What every woman lives for
Is to give her love to a man
He may not be the kind you find in picture books
A real-life hero with dashing handsome looks
He may not be the guy that you've been dreaming of
But that won't stop you from giving him your love
So, dear, can't you see
That it was meant to be
It's part
Part of our destiny
'Cause what every woman lives for
What every woman lives for
Is to give her love to a man
And I hope that man is me
Johnny likes her.
Maybe it'll be one big, happy triangle, and I'll come out on the right side.
What is this?
You wouldn't talk to me last night or today.
What did I do?
Who smiled at Nellie Bly last night, like she was the only girl in the world?
-Who is she, anyway?
-You really want to know?
-I really want to know.
-Where do you think I got this?
-You robbed a bank.
-$700, and I owe it all to her.
You owe it all to me.
I got nothing but admiration for a man who pays his debts.
Now we're even, give or take a few dollars.
When I win, I lose.
Who hates you up there?
If you see her again, and my advice is don't, thank Nellie Bly for me.
Somebody page me?
Anybody I haven't met yet, I'm Nellie Bly.
I'm Mitzi, last week's kisses.
Well, don't go away.
You might get him back on the rebound.
Rebound?
I'm the original rubber ball.
-Looks like Mitzi's got her hands full.
-Looks like you have.
-Hello, everybody.
-Hello.
I heard you wrote a new number I'll be in.
-That's the one I told you about.
-Frankie, this is Nellie.
-Shake hands and come out fighting.
-I just might do that.
Your claws are showing.
And they scratch.
I hear you're Braden's girl, off and on.
-I'm nobody's girl.
-Let's keep it that way.
Could we stop wasting time and rehearse?
-You written lots of hits?
-A trunk full. Wait till Joe hears this one.
Joe, the deckhand?
Joe Wilbur, the music publisher from New York.
He'll be out here next week.
It's money in the bank if he likes it.
Money you can keep.
-For how long?
-We own half the song.
On account of the title, Frankie and Johnny.
Well, at least the billing is right.
Let's hear it, Stephen Foster.
Frankie and Johnny were lovers
Oh, lordy, how they could love
Just play it.
Frankie and Johnny were lovers
Time they got married.
Oh, lordy, how they could love
Blabbermouth.
Swore to be true to each other
This story has no moral
This story has no end
This story only goes to show
That there ain't no good in men
They'll do you wrong
Yes, they'll do you wrong
Frankie and me, we are lovers
Oh, lordy, how we can love
Swore to be true to each other
Just as true as stars above
Frankie, I'm your man
I'll never do you wrong
I knew that I was a winner
When a new gal caught my eye
But I couldn't two-time Frankie
For that chick named Nellie Bly
I'm Frankie's man
I wouldn't do her wrong
Baby, leave me here to gamble
I'll be home before dawn
Don't wait up for me, honey
And don't you worry while I'm gone
Johnny, you're my man
Now, don't you do me wrong
Johnny, he wasn't too lucky
He was a loser that night
So he tried to change his luck
With the gal who wasn't right
He's Frankie's man
But he's doing her wrong
Frankie, I don't wanna make you no trouble
Honey, I don't wanna tell you no lie
But I saw your sweetman Johnny
He was messing around with that Nellie Bly
Well, if he's your man
Then he's doing you wrong
Frankie went back to find Johnny
She wasn't looking for fun
In her sweet, dainty little hand
She was toting a .44 gun
To shoot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong
Frankie looked into the barroom
Right there in front of her eye
There was her sweetman Johnny
Making love to that Nellie Bly
He was her man
She caught him doing her wrong
Johnny!
Frankie, I beg you, don't shoot me
They'll put you away in a cell
They'll put you where the cold wind blows
From the hottest corner of hell
Johnny, you're my man
But you're doing me wrong
Mr. Wilbur...
He was her man
But he done her wrong
Did I write a hit, Mr. Wilbur?
I'll be honest with you.
You know what's good about this song?
-The words?
-No.
-The music?
-No. Them.
You ought to be on Broadway.
-You didn't like the song?
-It's fine for their act.
I might even publish it. But a hit?
-I know one when I hear it.
-Well, you heard one tonight.
You're just saying you didn't because you don't want to give us an advance.
-Shut up, sweetheart.
-No advance, no song.
Back in the trunk it goes.
Now look, nobody pushes
Joe Wilbur around. Forget it!
-How big an advance?
-Talk to my business manager.
Well, now, Mr. Wilbur,
-$300, and the song is yours.
Well, let's just split the difference, shall we? $250.
Well, let's not quibble about it. $200 it is.
Mr. Wilbur, were you serious about Frankie and me?
I've seen better, but not very often.
-Isn't Johnny great?
-Isn't she wonderful?
All you need is some new costumes, arrangements, and special material.
Here's my card.
Look me up when you get to New York. Goodbye.
Thank you, Mr. Wilbur.
We're on our way!
Goodbye, riverboat! Hello, Broadway!
We never got discouraged
We never had a doubt
'Cause sooner or later
Talent must win out
Look out, Broadway, we're coming fast
Now we're gonna see our names in lights at last
No more hot dogs at Sloppy Joe's
We're gonna dine on steak and wine at Delmonico's
Rich or poor it's great to have dough
That's one thing we know
Lots of fun, lots of laughs
Signing checks and contracts and autographs
We're up for N-E-W Y-O-R-K
Look out, look out Broadway
I wanna see all the hustle and bustle
Maybe I can get a date with Lillian Russell
I wanna go out with Diamond Jim
Yeah, if he gives you a diamond what will you give to him?
Blow the trumpets and beat on the drums
Big town here we come
No more cheap hotels and one-night stands
We'll knock Tin Pan Alley flat on its pan
They'll see that we've got class with a capital "K"
Look out, look out, Broadway
Look out
Well, all we need is enough money to get to New York.
A lot more than $200.
-Don't look at me.
-Okay, I'll win it in the casino.
How can I lose with a beautiful redhead beside me?
-If you're thinking of Nellie...
-Nellie who?
Just remember this, if she's in, I'm out. Good night.
You would have hated New York, anyway.
We'll get there.
Peg, our half.
Frankie's half of our half.
Where's my half of our half?
Guess.
What am I, a mammary expert?
Got a brand-new rabbit's foot, a horseshoe from a derby winner, the lucky cricket Frankie gave me.
Now all you need is a new lucky redhead, and I know the perfect spot to find one.
Blonde.
Another blonde.
Brunette.
Blonde.
Heaven only knows.
Brunette.
Your guess is as good as mine.
It looks like somebody cornered the market on redheads.
Let's give it up for tonight.
With this money burning a hole in my pocket? No.
We could trap a blonde and dye her red.
I'm waiting here for the real thing.
Jackpot.
Watch the old master go to work.
-Hello, Eloise.
-Hello, Charlie.
Wait a minute. You're not Charlie.
-You're Jack.
-That's right, Eloise.
Eloise? I thought you said Abigail.
Pardon me, old master.
Are you alone, Abigail?
Practically.
Boyfriend passed out about an hour ago.
Can't hold his liquor.
And he's letting a lovely lady like you drift around by her little old lonesome?
Who's lonesome? I got you two.
She is no gentleman.
-Here we go.
-Place your bets.
Here we go.
-What number do you like?
-Thirteen.
Thirteen?
That's my lucky number, on account of I got 13 letters in my name.
A-B-I-G-A-I-L.
Thirteen.
Lady, you could stand a few lessons in arithmetic.
Does it have to be 13?
If you don't bet 13, I'll cry.
No more bets.
Thirteen, black!
You did it!
-What number do you like now?
-Thirteen. I like thirteen.
-Again?
-Thirteen. Bet it all.
Let it ride on 13.
Thirteen!
How about that?
-That gypsy knew something.
-Didn't I tell you?
Let it ride!
-Bet it all.
-All of it?
You can't hit 13 three times in a row.
Don't tell me you're some kind of a cheapskate.
The lady said let it ride, okay?
The limit's off.
-All of it goes on 13.
-No!
On 31.
-Don't you mean 13?
-I don't like 13 anymore.
I am fickle.
All right, all of it on 31.
He could use a little help.
The winner, 13!
Abigail, don't just lie there. Say something.
Who moved the table?
Frankie, did I wake you?
It's pretty sad music.
Sad? It's a dirge. I almost won $5,000.
Why didn't you quit when you were ahead?
Ask me an easier question.
All right, I will.
Why do I have to love a riverboat singer whose life is one great big roulette wheel?
Don't you ever win?
That's two questions, but I can only answer the second.
I wave no magic wand
I own no lucky charms
How then can I explain
An angel in my arms?
Must be beginner's luck
What else can it be?
When someone wonderful as you loves me?
I wave no magic wand
I own no lucky charms
How then can I explain
An angel in my arms?
Must be beginner's luck
What else can it be?
When someone wonderful as you
loves me?
Aren't you going to rehearse?
We're only an hour from New Orleans.
And less than 24 hours from being rich.
I'm dead broke.
Peg went through my pants last night, with me in them.
-I don't need any money from you.
-You don't?
No. I talked Braden into another advance.
-If I can talk Nellie into meeting...
-Nellie?
She's the right redhead, Cully.
I can win with her.
You can get your head broken.
Frankie and I belong in the big time.
You heard the man from Broadway.
I also heard Frankie tell you to keep away from Nellie.
Just one hot spin of the wheel is all I need, with Nellie beside me.
I'll come visit you in the hospital.
The song demands
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
We'll hear them play and keep that beat
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Let's get together what a treat
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Strike up the band, start the parade
Don't let that grand old rhythm fade
Just play that drum, play that number
When the saints come marching in
Shake tambourines, play that cornet
Crank up that horn you won't forget
Your heart will hum to that number
When the saints come marching in
The cymbals clang, just pound that beat
Sounds like a hundred marching feet
It's fun to join in that number
When the saints come marching in
See banners wave, oh, hear that ring
We all feel prouder than a king
'Cause everyone, everyone loves that number
When the saints come marching in
I don't know about you, but I killed them.
-New Orleans loves us.
-What's not to love?
Meet you back at the colonial house.
Peg and I must pick out our costumes for the Mardi Gras ball.
-What are you going as?
-Lady Godiva. What else?
Lady Godiva?
-That sure ain't fair to New Orleans.
-Let's hope she gets a long wig.
You sure there'll be nobody at the ball dressed like me?
Madam, in my shop we specialize in one-of-a-kind costumes.
Let's face it, you're adorable.
How can any man resist you?
My problem is just the other way around.
Allow me, my dear.
Thank you.
Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep.
I don't blame them for running away.
How do I look?
Honey, if I were Louis XV,
I'd make you queen.
I'll get our clothes.
Are you sure I'll be the only Madame Pompadour at the ball?
My dear young lady, this is a one-of-a-kind costume that I personally imported from Paris.
Little Bo Peep is ready for action.
Okay?
Charming.
What Madame Pompadour would've given to look like you.
Her head. Or was that Marie Antoinette?
Is this a good night to go out with the wrong man so that the right man will ask me to marry him?
For that any night is the right night, especially on Mardi Gras night.
Harry, give me a hand.
We still have 10 more
Madame Pompadours to get rid of.
Guess who?
-Nellie? I thought you changed your mind.
-Nellie? Why, Johnny, you...
Frankie, I knew it was you all the time.
I was just trying to make you jealous.
Convinced?
That was a guilty kiss if I ever had one, but let's go.
Go where?
You know Braden's holding open house in Suite 309.
-Come on.
-I promised to wait here for Cully.
Cully and who else?
Just Cully. I swear.
The left hand?
-All right. I'll meet you there. Suite 309.
-Frankie.
Remember how to do that after we get married.
Well, it fooled her.
-Watch it, I'm not getting any younger.
-You find Nellie yet?
Braden set her up in Room 306.
She said to meet her there.
Can't I talk you out of this, Johnny?
Not a chance.
Go up in 309 and keep Frankie busy.
I promised to do a number with the band.
Last year's model.
Everybody listen to me
Put a smile on your face
There's no reason to be gloomy
This world's a wonderful place
So when I say again happy
Shout it out
Yeah, get happy now
Shout it out
Well, now, there is no doubt you've got a lot to shout about
Give a yell life is swell
Shout it out
While there's good food you can taste
While there's music life's no waste
While there's great things happening
There's no end to the joy life can bring
I said come on get happy
Shout it out
Yeah, get happy now
Shout it out
Well now there is no doubt you've a lot to shout about
Give a yell life is swell
Shout it out
As long as there's someone you can love
As long as bright stars shine above
You've got no reason to be blue
Think what it means when your dreams all come true
I said come on get happy
Shout it out
Yeah, get happy now
Shout it out
Well, now, there is no doubt you've a lot to shout about
Give a yell life is swell
Shout it out
I said now there is no doubt you've a lot to shout about
Give a yell life is swell
Shout it out
There is no doubt you've a lot to shout about
Give a yell life is swell
Shout it out
Respect for Father Time.
Frankie, where are you going?
Frankie? It's me, Mitzi.
Nobody loves me.
I love you.
Did you know you were dressed just like Frankie?
That's why I'm leaving.
I caught Braden kissing me when he thought he was kissing Frankie.
I hate Nellie, but I'm going to tell her what's going on.
Why tell her?
I want her to be as miserable as I am.
Happy...
Whatever it is we're celebrating.
-That calls for a kiss.
-Go away, old man.
Old man? It's me.
Go away, old man.
Happy...
How about a kiss for the boss?
How about remembering I'm Johnny's girl?
Johnny?
Now, where do you suppose he is?
Where do you suppose Nellie is?
Hello, everyone. It's me, Cully.
Did you know that you and Mitzi are wearing...
I thought you were meeting Johnny.
Where is he?
Singing with the band.
I never heard him sound better.
His vibrato...
His vibrato had better not be in Nellie's room.
-Where is it?
-Right down the hall. 306.
I'll let you know if we're both wrong.
Hold it, pedal pusher.
Where is Johnny, really?
Not with Nellie, if that's what you're thinking.
-That's what he's thinking.
-Shut up, Blackie.
I didn't open my mouth.
Would Nellie two-time you? Would Johnny?
They'd be crazy.
Fill it up, Blackie.
Come in, Johnny. Be right with you.
Get up!
-Who are you?
-You know darn well who I am.
You'll never believe it, but you and me and Nellie are triplets.
Mitzi.
What are you doing here?
First you got to tell me where I am.
As one Madame Pompadour to the other...
Why did you say, "Come in, Johnny," when I knocked at the door?
Because I was expecting him.
Any objection?
If I start to pull your hair out,
I'm not going to stop at your wig.
Johnny thinks I'm his lady luck.
He just wants me to go to the casino with him.
What else does he have in mind?
That depends on how much he wins, or how much I want to lose.
Attention! I want attention, please.
Wouldn't it be funny if Johnny made love to me when he thought he was making love to Nellie, only it turned out to be you?
-She's not as dumb as she looks.
-$5 will get you $10.
No, wait a minute. She has a great idea.
Put on your mask.
What do you have in mind?
A little masquerade.
But first, what's the real reason you're going out with Johnny?
-To come between us?
-Of course not.
To make Braden jealous.
Jealous enough to ask me to marry him.
-You really love him!
-As much as you love Johnny.
Good. Now, let's hear you say,
Johnny, do you suppose
I could come between you and Frankie?
Johnny, do you suppose
I could come between you and Frankie?
Johnny, do you suppose
I could come between you and Frankie?
That's amazing!
-And convincing?
-You sound more like me than I do.
Now walk.
You've got to be born with that, but I'll try.
That's good.
Nellie.
-Nellie.
-Come in, darling.
-Sorry I'm late.
-I'll be with you in a minute.
I have to get a handkerchief.
Tonight's the night. I can feel it.
That roulette wheel's gonna light up.
So will Frankie if she finds out about us.
She'd kill me.
Yes, she would, just like in the song.
Ready or not, here I come.
We'll live it up tonight.
Now we're gonna prove the gypsy was right.
We'll do more than that, won't we?
You're for me, Nellie. All the way.
Nellie, where you going?
Nobody talks to me anymore.
I've been abandoned.
But Johnny isn't with Nellie. I told you.
Where is she?
Why didn't she come to my party?
-Don't go bruising your knuckles, boss.
-I don't need any nursemaids.
-Who's there? Identify yourself.
-Mitzi?
Come in, honey.
What are you doing here? Where's Nellie?
I'm here because I'm here.
Alone, by the world forgot.
I said, where's Nellie?
Her? She went out with Johnny.
I knew I was right.
She's cheating on you.
He's cheating on Frankie.
Why don't you cheat on somebody?
I have been taken.
I haven't.
Two can play that little game.
Two, like me and you?
I just love games.
Welcome home.
Watch the wig. It's rented.
-Who was that?
-Must have been Frankie.
-What was she doing here?
-How should I know? It's not my room.
-You worried about Braden?
-You worried about Frankie?
What she doesn't know won't hurt her, will it?
Chips, please. And lucky ones.
You stand right over here, where you were before.
That's it. Frankie's cricket for insurance.
How can I lose? Got my lucky girl with me.
-What number do you like?
-Two. Like in Frankie and you.
Why not? It rhymes.
Spin it real pretty.
-A winner. Two, black.
-How about that?
I can't miss with you.
Pick another number, and we'll walk out rich.
How about playing your age? Five.
-Five it is. Who wants to grow up?
-You're over the limit, sir.
Then raise it.
-The limit's off, sir.
-So is your hand.
-My hand?
-Off the magnet button.
-Or shall I say it loud and clear?
-We run an honest wheel here, mister.
The two of us will see to that.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets.
Don't be chintzy. Bet it all.
-On the five?
-And cover all the corners.
-You really know the game, don't you?
-I used to go with a gambler.
I'll surround that five so it can't get away.
Broke again. But just for a minute.
We run an honest game, remember?
Five!
-Winner, five.
-Cash me in, will you?
$10,000. I'm a millionaire.
-Didn't I tell you we'd do it?
-Yes, you did.
It's me and you, Nellie.
We'll break every casino they let us in.
Are you with me?
Why not?
It can't be. No two women kiss alike.
It can't be is right.
"From now on it's you and me, Nellie.
Are you with me?"
Maybe she is, but I'm not!
What happened?
He won, and I lost.
And it's just the way I want it.
-We're all washed up.
-I don't believe you.
No? Have a ball.
I might just be in the mood.
-You sure murdered them tonight.
-Yeah. Right through the heart.
Frankie, you came back.
-Nellie! What are you doing here?
-Maybe the gypsy was right.
Maybe we were meant for each other.
Place your bet.
Gee, it's great to be number one again.
Hold the thought.
What happened to your plan to make Braden jealous?
It backfired.
He switched to Mitzi, and so I'm switching to you.
-I could do worse.
-I doubt it.
You're still a loser, winner.
I owe you seven weeks' salary plus...
It was only champagne, honey.
He's all yours, Mitzi, what's left of him.
Back to 306?
No. Back to Frankie if she'll have me, gypsy or no gypsy.
Alone at last.
Okay. So I got the money for Broadway.
So what?
You're sure Frankie walked out on you?
I can still feel her farewell message.
-Sorry to interrupt the party.
-Frankie.
Look.
Look. This is our big-time bankroll.
We got it made.
-We?
-Sure. The gypsy was wrong.
I don't need a redhead. I need you.
You're my lady luck.
You're the family banker.
You know what I think of this money, or any gambling money?
I'll show you.
You wouldn't.
You would.
-Money!
-$50 bills!
Lady, you won't believe it, but some nut's throwing his money away.
I believe it.
Giddap. Come on.
-How disgusting.
-Money! It came out of the clouds!
Money! Let me in there!
Get out of my way!
Out of my way! Let me in there!
Folks.
-The money that flew out of the window...
-What money?
The money from the window.
I accidentally dropped it.
I didn't see any money. Did you?
I don't guess you did, did you?
Hey, kid. Did you see the money fly out of the window up there?
No, sir. I didn't see any money.
Okay.
Got change of $50, mister?
No. I ain't got change for $1.
I'm really feeling mighty low
No, no, no
I got no place that I can go
So I got some blues to sing and
So much remembering
Black cats, keep away from me
Take my advice
Go shinny up a tree
I've got hard luck
The hardest kind of luck you'll find
I ain't lying
I've got the bluest kind of blues
Driving me right out of my mind
She's gone
Said toodle-oo
Kissed her goodbye and my-my my money too
I've got hard luck
The hardest kind of luck you've seen
I mean
The way I'm running lately
My lucky number is 13
Where do I belong?
Everything I do is wrong, all wrong
Wrong as can be
Who's stacking all the decks
Lady Luck has got the hex on me
Permanently
Shove off
Oh, I'm warning you
This thing I caught, you know
Could be catching too
I've got hard luck
The hardest kind of luck there can be
Yes, siree
I guess hard luck always chooses
Natural born losers like me
How long have we been drinking?
Since last night.
How's your head, the one I opened the champagne bottle on?
You really launched me.
But you did knock some sense into it.
You found out that it's really me that you go for?
No. It's Nellie.
But Nellie went "Bly-Bly."
How could she run out on me with Johnny Nothing?
Women. Whoever invented them?
Come in.
-Did you find them?
-Couldn't find them anywhere, boss.
I turned New Orleans upside down.
How does it look that way?
You want me to throw her out?
It's no bother.
Two more drinks, and she'll float out.
Looks like no Johnny, no Frankie, no Nellie.
But you've still got me.
Charming, lovable, talented Mitzi.
The girl with a past and no future.
Maybe you should've done what my father did to my mother.
-What was that?
-Marry her.
You should've married Nellie Bly.
Maybe.
But I hated to spoil such a beautiful friendship.
What a world.
Everybody's split up.
You and Nellie, Frankie and Johnny, me and anybody.
If anybody cares, I'm back, I'm sorry.
Nobody cares.
Please don't stop
Loving me
You were born
Just to be
In my arms
In my arms
Please don't stop
Loving me
Your lips were made
Just to be
Kissed by me
Kissed by me
When I'm with you
I don't know
Day from night
Wrong from right
You're my world
That's all I know
I love you so
I won't let go
Please don't stop
Loving me
Darling you'll
Always be
Mine alone
Mine alone
-Who is it?
-Frankie.
I'm sorry Johnny and I missed the show last night, Mr. Braden.
What about tonight?
You still got the show for a couple of months.
-Only because you paid Johnny in advance.
-Can I count on two months?
If I don't shoot him for real in the Frankie and Johnny number.
There's a thought.
Come on, Mitzi. We got an act to do.
I love him. He loves Nellie.
There never should've been two sexes.
Never.
Hey, boss.
Wouldn't it be nice if Frankie shot Johnny like she said?
No such luck.
No. I've got enough nerve now.
Before I do it, would you tell me something, Pete?
-Before you do what?
-Can a gal get away with shooting her guy?
-What girl? What guy?
-You don't follow too good.
Now, look. This is him.
This is her.
Her shoots him for two-timing her with her.
Now, does her get away with it, or does her get it in the neck?
I'd say not guilty, but, of course, I ain't no judge.
Thanks, Pete. You're a real pal.
Do you think a girl should believe a man like Johnny?
No woman should ever believe any man, but we always do.
-Are you ready to forgive him?
-Not a chance.
-Frankie, honey.
-Yes, Johnny dear?
Remember now, in a situation like this, always do the honest thing, lie.
-It's me, the reformed gambler.
-Come in, reformed gambler.
She's playing hard to get.
You missed me.
Kid's got a great arm.
Eddie.
Do you think a girl could get away with murder just because she's beautiful and got nice legs?
Not if I was on the jury.
She'd have to have a nice figure, too.
Like Frankie's. Is that what you mean?
If my wife had a face and legs and a figure like Frankie,
I'd give up work and stay home.
Frankie says you've been hitting the bottle over me.
Was she telling the truth?
Nellie, you are just in time.
Just in time for what?
I want to propose a merger.
A merger like two companies, or a merger like two people?
A merger like marriage.
How about it?
Ask me again after the show.
I want to play hard to get for a change.
I forgot Frankie's gun.
All right, folks. Here we go. On-stage.
Frankie, you got to forgive me.
-Why?
-Because Johnny loves Frankie.
I'll tell her if I see her.
This story has no moral
This story has no end
This story only goes to show
That there ain't no good in men
They'll do you wrong
Yes, they'll do you wrong
Frankie and me, we are lovers
Oh, lordy, how we can love
Swore to be true to each other
Just as true as stars above
Frankie, I'm your man
I'll never do you wrong
Johnny, he wasn't too lucky
He was a loser that night
So he tried to change his luck
With a gal who wasn't right
He's Frankie's man
But he's doing her wrong
Frankie, I don't wanna make you no trouble
Honey, I don't wanna tell you no lie
But I saw your sweetman Johnny
He was messing around with that Nellie Bly
Well, if he's your man
Then he's doing you wrong
Frankie went back to find Johnny
She wasn't looking for fun
In her sweet, dainty little hand
She was toting a .44 gun
To shoot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong
Blackie, who do you know who can marry us right away?
-You and who?
-Nellie and me.
Johnny Nothing was really nothing in her life.
How about that?
Boss, things are working out just like you...
What's wrong?
I was only doing what I thought you wanted me to do.
-You know, I was only...
-What are you trying to say?
You know the blank cartridge
Frankie shoots Johnny with?
What about it?
It ain't blank. I put in a real bullet.
Frankie is gonna shoot Johnny dead.
You stupid...
Sorry.
What's the matter with him?
She caught him doing her wrong
Johnny!
Frankie, I beg you don't shoot me
They'll put you away in a cell
They'll put you where the cold wind blows
From the hottest corner of hell
Johnny, you're my man
But you're doing me wrong
Don't shoot!
Close the curtain!
Close the curtain? What for?
What's the matter, Mr. Braden?
-What's happened?
-That was a real bullet.
Johnny, don't die. Please don't die.
I love you.
You can gamble all you want.
-You really mean that?
-I want you any way you are.
Baby, you got me.
But that gun was really loaded.
I did feel something.
It looks like a bullet dent.
But who put the bullet in the gun?
Let's just say, a misguided friend.
I'm asking again, do you want to get married?
What have I got to lose?
I think I'll give him the air.
Everybody come aboard the showboat tonight
We're gonna dance till the morning light
We'll have fun the whole night long
There'll be jokes and song
Forget your troubles, forget your strife
You'll have the best time of your life
Hey, everyone, let's go, on with the show
We're down by the levee
Showboat's at the bank
Bring money to spend
You're welcome, my friend
Just walk up the plank
Everybody come aboard the showboat tonight
Look around at the happy sight
We'll guarantee that you'll have a ball
Come on, one and all
What a great night you've got in store
You wanna keep coming back for more
Hey, everyone, let's go, on with the show
What a great night you've got in store
I bet you wanna keep coming back for more
Hey, everyone, let's go, on with the show
Will you stop your daydreaming,
Tommy Stubbins?
- Hello, Matt.
- Come and help me select a suitable dinner...
- for me clients here.
- Can I push the barrow?
Well, it's not gonna push itself now, is it?
It's against my religion to do anything violent till the end of the day.
God bless all Irishmen.
You know what I was thinking, Matt?
- No, what was that?
Not for you, me darling.
It'll make your fur fall out.
I was thinking that if you sold your fish barrow, and I sold my grandfather's watch, we could buy a boat and go to China.
Oh. Oh, you're the middle and two ends of a fine fellow, Tom.
It's a beautiful proposition, but don't you see the problem?
- What's that?
- Well, do you speak Chinese?
- No.
- Then, if you sell your grandfather's watch, and we go to China, how are you goin' to tell the time?
- I never thought of that.
- Ah, well, you see, you have to plan ahead.
It's very important.
I mean, the whole secret of my success with the fish barrow... was years of planning ahead.
Thank you, Charlie.
May the 17 holy men of Donnybrook reward you in heaven.
I'd sooner you rewarded me down here.
- Who's this then?
- Wild duck off the marshes.
- Is that a fact?
- Flew straight into the mast, cross-eyed fool.
Can you imagine that now?
He was probably under the influence.
He looks Irish to me.
Don't worry.
I'll fix him up.
Bring him back.
That's my dinner.
Now don't ask me to do that, Charlie.
As Secretary for the Preservation of Irish Ducks, it's more than me job is worth.
You never told me you were secretary of Irish ducks.
Oh, well, now I don't talk about it much.
- I'm a very modest fella.
- What are we going to do with it then?
Well, now, as soon as
I finish me deliveries, we'll take him over to John Dolittle.
- Here.
- Who's John Dolittle?
Eat hearty, me lovelies.
- And heaven bless all Catholic pussycats.
- Who is John Dolittle?
John Dolittle is the greatest animal doctor in the world today... and a close personal friend of Matthew Mugg.
He lives right here in Puddleby, he does.
- Out on the Oxenthorpe Road.
- What does he do?
He's a genius. That's what he does.
He can talk to animals.
- Talk to them?
- Speaks their language, he does.
Just like you and me's chatting now.
He'll have a word with that little fellow in wild duck talk... and put him straight in no time.
Oh, the darlin' man.
He'd think nothin' of travelin' halfway round the world to cure a sick sparrow.
Only last week, he went all the way to Africa.
Ask me why.
- Why?
- Why? I'll tell you.
To look after a crocodile with toothache.
He's altogether a marvelous man.
And he understands the Irish.
And any man who understands the Irish
Can't be reckoned altogether bad
The same way that the lunatic
Whose patron saint is Patrick
Can't be reckoned altogether mad
The doctor's very smart
He's an Irishman at heart
His favorite color
Sure it must be green
And also he's a man
Who'll blarney when he can
Let me explain the sort of thing I mean
My friend the doctor says the moon is made of apple pie
And once a month it's eaten by the sun
And that is why up in the sky
You'll find as every month goes by
Somebody in the sky is making another one
My friend the doctor says the sun is made of cheddar cheese
The doctor even knows the reason why
The facts are these
Try if you please
Pretending you're a lonely cheese
Wouldn't you want to try finding an apple pie
Of course you would.
Maybe what the doctor tells me
Isn't altogether true
But I love every tale he tells me
I don't know any better ones
Do you?
My friend the doctor says the world is full of fantasy
And who are you and I to disagree
Let's hope and pray that is the way
The life we love will always stay
For my friend the doctor
And me
La, la, la, la
Here, Tom, catch!
My friend the doctor says the stars are made of lemon drops
The bigger ones are lollipops and ice  Come on!
The clouds have shops up on the top
That sells you sweets and soda pop
What do they call the place
-  Isn't it paradise
My friend the doctor says that every time it starts to rain
And people run indoors again in swarms
If you remain out in the rain
You'll think you're drinking pink champagne
And you'll spend your life praying for thunderstorms
Maybe what the doctor tells me
Isn't altogether true
But I love every tale he tells me
I don't know any better ones
Do you?
My friend the doctor says the world is full of fantasy
And who are you and I to disagree
Let's hope and pray that is the way
The life we love will always stay for my friend the doctor
My friend the doctor and me
What was that?
- Ah, now, that's just some of his pets.
- Pets?
Polynesia, me lovely little darling.
Give us a kiss then. Here.
And, Chee-Chee, how are you, me old rascal?
I'd like you to meet one of me dearest friends. Master Thomas Stubbins.
Tom, this is Miss Polynesia.
How do you do, Master Stubbins?
How do you do, Miss Polynesia?
You wanna watch out for her, Tom.
She's 199 years old.
She can remember every single word that's been spoken to her... since the execution of Charles I in 1648.
- Isn't that right, Polynesia?
- No, Matthew, 'twas 1649.
'Twas a Tuesday.
Oh, yeah, right.
You see what I mean?
And this is Chee-Chee.
- How do you do, Chee-Chee?
- Where's the good doctor?
- He's working in the library.
Show them in, Chee-Chee.
I know he's in there.
Good heavens, Matthew.
Oh, I'm terrible sorry. I must have frightened them out of their lives.
Matthew, you're soaking wet.
You're a little on the damp side yourself, sir.
Oh, it's these fish languages.
They really only work underwater.
It's fascinating.
The basic system is mouth movements and bubble signals.
At the moment,
I can only make big bubbles, and they keep telling me I'm shouting.
Beggin' me ignorance, sir, but what can you hope to get out of a conversation with a goldfish?
Matthew, I'll show you.
The legendary great pink sea snail.
For hundreds of years, sailors have claimed that they've seen it.
Oh, poor devils.
It's that rotten stock they drink.
But, uh, what has this got to do with goldfish?
I don't believe it's legendary.
I believe it actually exists.
What's that got to do with goldfish?
Well, I'm planning a voyage to find it.
That is, if I can get enough money together.
Oh, may the saints reward you, sir.
But, uh, what's that got to do with the...
Well, if I find it, Matthew,
I'm going to want to talk to it.
Therefore, I have to acquire a knowledge of ancient shellfish, which is extremely complicated.
So, I'm starting with basic fish languages, like halibut, mackerel and goldfish.
Ah, there, you see? I knew it had something to do with goldfish.
Now, about your last voyage, Doctor.
Did, uh, did you find the crocodile with a toothache?
Crocodile?
Oh, yes, in the Congo, yes.
I got back on Saturday.
- Look.
- Isn't that a beauty now?
Make a marvelous bottle opener.
Look at that, Tom.
Oh, forgive me, Doctor.
- This is me ol' pal, Tommy Stubbins.
- How do you do, sir?
- He's brought a patient for you.
- It's a duck, sir.
- It's a drake.
You're sopping wet too.
- Yes, sir, it's raining.
He's hurt his wing, sir.
- Yes, so he's been telling me.
Oh, quack, quack.
Oh, poor chap, yes.
Sorry.
Quack, quack.
He had a row with his wife and wasn't looking where he was going.
He told you all that?
They're very neurotic creatures.
You'll be all right by the morning.
Yes, I'll get word to your wife.
Quack, quack, quack.
Now, while our friend's convalescing,
I'll try and find you something dry to wear.
Then, we all can have some food together.
- Polynesia, two more for dinner.
- Yes, Doctor.
Oh, and, Matthew, hold on to that crocodile's tooth.
Must be a bottle somewhere you can open with it.
Gub-Gub.
Will you please stop making that infernal noise?
A few pork sausages and a bit of bacon.
The way you're carrying on, you'd think we were cooking your entire family.
Chee-Chee, make him behave.
But you can hardly blame him for being a bit upset, Doctor.
I'd be upset meself if you started frying Irishmen.
You know the problem as well as I do, Matthew.
I've nearly 600 mouths to feed, including the mice.
- Six hundred!
- Yes. So if the butcher... gives me a string of sausages now and then, I take it, whether it upsets Gub-Gub or not.
Anyway, he eats more than any of us.
Sure you won't be having anything?
- Quite sure. Thank you, Matthew.
- Aren't you hungry, Doctor?
Yes, but I follow a very special diet, Stubbins.
- It's highly nutritious and very good.
- Oh, I see.
The doctor's in rather an awkward position, you see, Tom.
- Aren't you, Doctor?
- What do you mean, Matt?
You understand, Stubbins, he means meat.
It upsets the animals if I, uh...
- Oh, of course.
- So I don't.
As a matter of principle, one should always try to avoid eating one's friends.
The day that I became a veterinarian
I had a sudden overwhelming wish
To be a pure and simple vegetarian
And give up eating all that meat and fish
- I think that's marvelous.
- Meat is very unhealthy for you.
So now I live on healthy food instead
Like apple cores and parsnip juice
And chunks of plain brown bread
All right, all right.
I'm coming.
When I see my fellowman consuming sirloin steak
And I find myself enjoying tea and Dundee cake
There is really only one conclusion I can make
I'm a devoted vegetarian
No, no, no, no, you've had yours.
When my host at dinner offers succulent roast beef
Proudly I refuse it
People stare in disbelief
Lost in admiration as I nibble on a leaf
A very noted vegetarian
I wouldn't even eat horseradish, in case I upset the horses.
I stay away from deviled ham on principle
I wouldn't eat roast duckling if I could
Willpower has made me invincible
My word
Those sausages look good
Where's my dinner gone?
They've done it again.
Come on. Own up. Who's got it this time? Who's got my dinner?
It's bad enough to have to eat this muck in the first place.
Just 'cause I eat this instead of eating them, they think they can take advantage of me.
You've no idea what I put up with on their account.
I eat every flowering shrub there is except for gorse
Sometimes I get luxuries like beetroot leaves, of course
My life's much the same as that of any English horse
Why should I be a vegetarian
Turnip pie and peanuts
That's the sort of filth I eat
Any sort of rubbish that is wholesome and discreet
Why don't I admit that my hypocrisy's complete
If I should live to be a centenarian
Become our most adored humanitarian
I'll never make a decent vegetarian
I'm a cheat, I love meat
I'm a cheat, yes, I am
I love red-blooded juicy chunks of meat
Legs of lamb, sides of beef
And chops and steaks and veal and pork, of course
-  My favorite meal
And then I hear poor Gub-Gub squeal
Oh, me, oh, my
A reluctant but sincere
Vegetarian
Am I
So, you see, Stubbins, being an animal doctor has its problems.
For one thing, you don't get paid anything, at least not in money.
You get bones or nuts or worms... or whatever the particular animal's currency happens to be.
And secondly, most of the animals who come here as patients like it so much, they stay here permanently.
It's hardly what you'd call a profit-making enterprise.
But who looks after the animals?
They look after themselves, for the most part.
Animals are much better at that than human beings.
And how did you become a veteran?
No, Stubbins, the word is "veterinarian."
But say "animal doctor."
It's less pretentious.
It all happened rather suddenly, actually.
My entire life changed in one day, didn't it, Matthew?
It was my sister, Sarah, who started it all.
Sarah.
Oh!
Did you know that an ant has more intelligence than a hippopotamus?
And that a grasshopper... in relation to his size... has more power in his hind legs than a kangaroo?
Absolutely fascinating.
There's no doubt about it. Animals are much more interesting than people.
Good heavens, Sarah.
What on Earth are you doing down there?
There are pigeons in the linen cupboard.
- Oh, yes, I thought it would be warmer for them.
- You knew?
Yes, I put them there. It gets so terribly chilly on the roof at night.
And two tortoises in the guest room.
That's where they are.
I wondered where they got to.
- And white mice in your chest of drawers.
- That's right.
And the grass snakes are in the roll top desk under the envelopes.
Grass snakes?
John Dolittle, if those animals aren't out of this house by tonight...
Oh, dear!
Nine o'clock precisely.
That will be Lady Petherington.
I wonder what she's found wrong with herself today.
All right, Sarah.
Show her in, please.
I mean it, John.
I shall leave.
Those animals, they're destroying your practice.
You won't have a decent patient left soon.
Not unless you answer the door.
I don't understand the things that go on around this house with those animals.
And we'll probably never see the vicar's wife again... after giving her that glass of milk with a frog in it.
I really don't know what you expect me to do.
Oh, good morning,
Lady Petherington.
Are we feeling better today?
We're no better for being left to freeze to death on Doctor's front doorsteps.
Oh.
Dr. Dolittle, oh, it's my nerves.
You must do something for them instantly.
Oh, you'll never guess what happened.
It's quite the worst experience of my life.
Uh, won't you come in,
Lady Petherington?
I was giving this dinner party last night... up at the Grange for the Duke of St. Albans.
Fifty guests. The most embarrassing moment of my entire life.
A mouse ran across the table.
Oh, I thought I'd die.
I may still.
Can you imagine? A mouse.
Do you know who was there, hmm?
Well, of course, everybody.
The humiliation.
Crown Prince Angelicus of Brandenberg.
He's so well-bred, he doesn't even know what a mouse is.
Fainted dead away.
I haven't slept all night.
Of course, I discharged my entire staff, especially the gardeners.
I'll be struck from the social directory.
A mouse. Hmph.
- Vicar, what a surprise!
- Bless me.
How is your frog?
I mean, your wife.
Oh, the less said about her the better.
I mean, that incident.
Most unfor... for... for... fortunate.
Bless me.
Miss Dolittle, it's my hay fever.
The Bishop of Glastonbury is attending my sermon this evening,
- and it's most important, you understand.
- Of course.
- But my hay... hay...
Oh! Oh! Oh!
But... But... Oh!
- Oh!
- Sir Rupert, I'm so sorry!
Where in the heavens does that woman think she's going?
- Get out of my way, Vicar!
Oh!
Ow!
Oh!
Oh!
Ow!
Oh, let me out of this madhouse!
- Oh! Oh!
- Sir Rupert, I'm so sorry!
Ow!
John!
Yes, Sarah?
I shall give you just five minutes to make up your mind.
Either you get rid of every hideous bird, beast and reptile... in this ridiculous menagerie immediately,
- or I am leaving... today!
- But...
- Five minutes.
- Sarah, I can't just...
Oh, yes, you can just.
I don't think five minutes is very long.
Anybody home?
Oh, come in, Matthew.
Well, l-I didn't know you was having a party.
What are we celebrating?
You know, Matthew, today I made a great discovery.
Oh? What was that then?
I'm a terrible doctor.
I'm probably the worst doctor in the world.
Good for you.
I like a man who knows his worth.
I have absolutely no interest in the health and welfare of my patients.
I can't begin to communicate with them.
I don't even want to communicate with them.
I've come to the conclusion that, with the possible exception of yourself,
I have nothing in common with the human race.
You know, the trouble with you,
John Dolittle, is you prefer animals to people.
But animals are so much more fun than people.
Then be an animal doctor.
- What was that?
- I said, "Be an animal doctor."
Animal doctor?
You know more about animals than anybody I've ever met.
I could get every sick animal within miles to come to you.
Aye, so could I.
At least all the dogs and cats.
All the rich ones, that is.
The Pekes and the poodles.
I could slip a little something into their meat.
Shh, Matthew.
What do you mean?
I mean, there isn't one good animal doctor in the west of England.
Farmer Green's cow was saying only the other day... she just will not have another calf until she gets a decent doctor.
You mean, you spoke to her?
At the Animals' Welfare League.
We meet every Wednesday.
She's chair-cow.
You mean, animals actually talk to one another?
Well, of course, we can.
Do you think we're all dumb?
L... No, no.
I knew parrots could talk.
Parrots are the finest linguists in the animal kingdom.
I speak over 2,000 languages, including dodo and unicorn.
- Unicorn?
- I have a classical education.
Polynesia, could I learn to talk to animals?
I don't see why not.
You're quite intelligent.
Oh, thank you.
If I succeeded, I could become... the greatest animal doctor in the world.
Oh, no question.
Mind you, it isn't easy.
I'm the only parrot in the world... who actually understands what she's talking about.
Well, if you can do it,
I don't see why I shouldn't.
I like your attitude.
Why have I never thought of this before?
Polynesia, I want you to teach me everything you know.
What, 2,000 languages?
Certainly. We'll start at 8:00 tomorrow morning.
But it took me over a hundred years.
Then we'll start at 7:00.
There's not a moment to lose.
Matthew, think what it would mean...
If I could talk to the animals
Just imagine it
Chatting to a chimp in chimpanzee
Imagine talking to a tiger
Chatting to a cheetah
What a neat achievement that would be
If we could talk to the animals
Learn their languages
Maybe take an animal degree
I'd study elephant and eagle buffalo and beagle
Alligator, guinea pig and flea
I would converse in polar bear and python
And I would curse in fluent kangaroo
If people asked me
Can you speak rhinoceros
I'd say, of course-eros
Can't you
If I conferred with our furry friends
Man-to-animal
Think of the amazing repartee
If I could walk with the animals
Talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals
And they could talk to me
If I consulted with quadrupeds
Think what fun we'd have
Asking over crocodiles for tea
Or maybe lunch with two or three lions
Walruses or sea lions
What a lovely place the world would be
If I spoke slang to orangutans
The advantages any fool on Earth could plainly see
Discussing Eastern art and dramas
With intellectual llamas
That's a big step forward
You'll agree
I'd learn to speak in antelope and turtle
My Pekingese would be extremely good
If I were asked to sing in hippopotamus
I'd say, why not-amus and would
If I could parley with pachyderms
It's a fairy tale worthy of Hans Andersen or Grimm
A man who walks with the animals
Talks with the animals
Grunts and squeaks and squawks with the animals
This is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me, Polynesia.
I can't wait to start.
Just the very thing.
For instance, Polynesia, how would I say...
"good morning" to our friend there?
In pig talk, I mean.
That's simple.
- Was that it?
- Why, yes.
It's remarkable.
What was all the leg-shaking business?
That's part of "good morning."
Most animal languages are a mixture of sounds and movements.
A short snort means "good."
Shaking the leg means "morning."
And you... And you just put the two together?
That's right.
Didn't answer me.
No, that's your right leg.
That means "good night."
Oh.
She answered.
Did you see that? She answered.
All I went was...
Did it again.
Good heavens. I speak pig.
Where are we going?
I want to say good morning to every animal in Puddleby.
It's incredible.
It's impossible.
But it's true.
A man can talk to the animals
It's a miracle
In a year from now I guarantee
I'll be the marvel of the mammals
Playing chess with camels
No more just a boring old M.D.
I'll study every living creature's language
So I can speak to all of them on sight
If friends say
Can he talk in crab or pelican
You'll say, like helican and you'll be right
And if you just stop to think a bit
There's no doubt of it
I shall win a place in history
For I can walk with the animals
Talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals
And they can squeak and squawk
And speak and talk
To me
Needless to say, Stubbins,
I've neither seen nor spoken... to dear sister, Sarah, from that day to this.
But I do have the consolation of being able to speak 498 animal languages.
Any one of which is more fun than talking to Sarah.
Four hundred and ninety-eight?
With goldfish, it will be 499.
When you get to 500, Doctor, we ought to have a party.
We must.
You'll need more than languages before we can search for the great pink sea snail.
Voyages cost money, you know.
Mm, quite.
Now, gentlemen, if you'll forgive me, animals are earlier risers than human beings, and I've got to be up at 5:30 to open the clinic.
Good heavens.
You can't go home in that.
Matthew, you can make up a bed here, if you don't mind Gub-Gub snoring.
Stubbins can sleep on the sofa in the library.
Polynesia will go over to your house and tell your parents you're all right.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
He's a genius.
Uh-hum.
I think you're next.
What did you tell her?
To take two of these pills three times a day after meals.
Polynesia, remember that lady owes us a gallon of milk.
- All right, Doctor.
- Now, what next?
This mouse. He has a bent tail.
Oh, it's you again.
Well, that's the third time this week.
What's that machine?
It's a whisker and tail straightener.
My own invention.
These field mice are always getting caught in General Bellowes' pantry... up at the Grange.
Being a military man, he has a regular defense system of mousetraps, and they're all having very narrow escapes, like this one.
There we are.
That should do it. Good as new.
There.
But, uh, keep away from General Bellowes' pantry.
Next.
Good morning, Sheila.
On the desk, please, Stubbins.
Yes, sir.
- Oh, I see.
- What's the matter?
Apparently one of her children have got flat feet.
This one? Yes.
Very dangerous in hunting season.
Can't run fast enough.
I'll work out some form of exercise.
Bum-bum. Bum-bum.
Bum-bum. Something like that.
Anyhow, we'd better see our other patients first.
I can get on with this later.
Good boy, Jip.
Uh-oh.
Ah, Toggle.
Oh, yes, of course.
Toggle's getting a bit shortsighted in his old age.
There now.
We'll just, uh, test these.
Now, I'm sure this will be better than the last time.
Good Lord. That's excellent.
Polynesia, remember
Toggle owes me a free ride... next time I have to go to Plymouth or Penzance.
Yes, Doctor.
What the devil! Emma, I'll murder him if I lay my hands on him!
- That's Bellowes' voice.
- Damn it! What's the matter?
Out of my way!
Out of my way!
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!
There he is.
We've caught him red-handed.
- Emma, you're a witness.
- A witness to what?
The most flagrant display of organized animal stealing... in the history of Puddleby crime.
Organized? I beg...
I am a doctor, sir.
You are a horse thief, sir.
That is my plow horse.
It's no good your trying to disguise him.
He's wearing glasses because he's shortsighted.
I'd recognize him anywhere.
Take them off. At once, sir.
Shortsighted. That won't sound very convincing in front of the magistrate.
- Magistrate?
- I'm prosecuting, and I don't fancy your chances in court.
I'm the magistrate, and if I weren't late for my foxhunt,
I'd report you for cruelty to animals.
Don't you dare lay a finger on her.
- She's one of my patients.
- One of your what?
She's been chased by your wretched foxhounds three times in two weeks.
You've already murdered her husband.
If anything happened to her, these babies are going to be orphans.
It's all right, Sheila.
I won't let him hurt you.
I've never heard... Sheila?
Just the sight of you is enough to give her a heart attack.
Look at her.
She's a complete nervous wreck.
She'll be more than that by the time I'm finished with her!
- You'll never catch her.
- Tallyho!
There are times when the English are rather tiresome.
Bellowes, no!
Out of my way!
- Out of my way! Out of my way!
- Oh, well.
"Never catch her," eh?
What do you think this is?
My horse!
- Where did they come from?
- North America.
We formed an Anglo-American
Fox Protection Society.
Purely volunteer, of course.
Fox Protection Society?
Yes. During the hunting season, a skunk will always run with a fox.
The idea is to put the hounds off the scent.
I never dreamt it would work so well.
- How dare you!
- I beg your pardon?
- General Bellowes...
- He certainly does.
- Is my uncle.
- I'm sorry.
- Is that an apology?
- I'm sorry he's your uncle.
And I'm sorry I'm his niece.
- It must be terrible.
- What do you mean?
Having a name like Bellowes.
- My name is Emma Fairfax.
- Oh, that's a bit better.
What I meant was that if I were his nephew instead of his niece...
If you were his nephew, you'd hardly be called Emma Fairfax.
- If I were a man...
- Fred Fairfax?
I have never in my entire experience... known anyone treat people as appallingly as you do.
I don't treat people, madam.
I treat animals.
You treat people like animals too.
And I have nothing but contempt for people whose idea of pleasure... is to take a defenseless animal and make a social event out of a ritual killing.
- That's it, John Dolittle. You tell her.
- Matthew, I am telling her.
- You make it sound...
- Furthermore...
- Don't keep interrupting me!
- I'm sorry. What did you wish to say?
Oh, I've forgotten!
Very well. Furthermore, I would deem it a favor if in the future... you and your bloodthirsty relatives... would avoid coming here and upsetting the animals.
In any case, I find it hard to believe that a grown man... can waste his entire life playing with animals in the first place.
And I, madam, find it equally hard to believe... that a grown woman could spend her entire life doing absolutely nothing.
You got to admit that for someone called Fred, she's a fair-looking fellow.
If I were a man
I'd scratch his eyes out
I'd tear his hair out by the roots
And kick his shins in with my boots
And I would bite his hand as only I can
If only I could be a man
A great man would not hesitate
To put Dr. Dolittle to death
Attila the Hun
To name only one
Would chuckle at his dying breath
It seems a man can be as rude as he likes
Crude as he likes
Lewd as he likes too
But a girl must be discreet as she can
Sweet as she can
Neat as she can too
But that's not the life
That I want to lead
Normal and formal as homespun tweed
I need the freedom to go
Where I please
But where
Do I please
I don't know
That's the trouble
I don't know
Here I stand at the crossroads of life
Childhood behind me
The future to come
And alone
Nothing planned at the crossroads of life
But life will find me
More grateful than some
It has known
Grateful to see
All the wonderful things I see
Grateful to be
What life expects me to be
So I stand at the crossroads of life
This way or that way
Well, which shall I go
Towards the left or the right
Towards the day or the night
Towards the dark or the light
Only my heart can know
Only my heart
Can know
- What is it?
- Ha. I don't know, Doctor.
It just arrived for ya.
- It's making funny noises.
- Extraordinary-looking thing.
- It's from Tibet.
It's probably that pink sea snail you was lookin' for.
No, it's not big enough for that.
What do you suppose it is?
Well, we could always open it and find out.
Oh, yes. What a good idea.
Ah. Oh, look, it's a llama.
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.
I think he's nervous. Open up the other end and give him a push, Matthew.
Here.
There's another one at this end.
There's two of them.
Two llamas? How thoughtful of somebody.
People are awfully nice.
- What are you going to do with them?
- We could make ourselves... a couple of nice overcoats for a start.
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.
This way, lad. Come on. Come on.
That's a good fella.
I don't believe it. It can't be.
- It is! It is!
- What? What? What?
It's a pushmi-pullyu.
- Look.
- Holy O'Reilly. Forgive me.
I'll never touch another drop.
Stubbins, pat the other end.
They're very timid.
This is without doubt the first one that's ever been captured.
If I had a head at each end,
I'd take a bit of catchin' too.
- What's he saying, Doctor?
- It's rather difficult to understand.
It's a camel dialect with rather a thick accent.
- A message? Oh, a message for me.
- Is this it?
Ah, yes, it's from Long Arrow.
I should have guessed.
Who's he when he's at home?
The greatest naturalist in the world and a very old friend.
- He's a Red Indian gentleman.
- With a name like Long Arrow,
I didn't think he was Irish.
- What's all them drawings, Doctor?
- Picture writing.
It's the only way we can communicate.
You see, this means the pushmi-pullyu is a gift.
The open hand, you see?
For me. That's me.
From his friend, Long Arrow.
To make money to take a ship... to search for great pink sea snail.
Signed Long Arrow.
Oh, that's marvelous.
But tell me, Doctor, how do you make money with a pushmi-pullyu?
I thought it was obvious. Stubbins, what would you do if you had two heads?
- I'd join a circus, sir.
- Exactly.
Excuse me. I'm looking for the proprietor.
You've found him. Albert Blossom.
- Splendid. How do you do?
My name's Dolittle.
- I'm not interested.
- I thought you might like to see a rather unusual...
- No, I wouldn't.
It's probably something you haven't seen before.
I've seen everything before.
- Then you aren't interested?
- That's right. I'm not interested.
Come along, Matthew.
- Sorry to have troubled you. Good day.
- Good day.
- It's a trick.
- No, it's no trick.
Why... But... I've never seen anything like it.
- Neither has anybody else.
- Hey, whoa! I say, come here!
Just a minute.
Hey, hey! I mean, l-I've never seen anything like it.
I mean, I've seen the world
I've been around
I can tell you stories that would quite astound you
I'm not a fool
I went to school
I've been from
Liverpool to Istanbul
Istanbul, I'm no fool
And anyone will tell you that
I'm sharper than a knife
But I've never seen anything like it in my life
- It's a pushmi-pullyu.
- Is it?
Well, I've never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it in my life
- It's the rarest animal on Earth.
- It certainly is!
Hey, hold up a moment. Hey!
I mean, I know the game
I've seen them all
I could tell you stories that would quite enthrall you
I know me job
Pleasin' the mob
I give 'em what they want for just two bob
Just two bob
Well, that's my job
But this is so fantastic
I can't wait to tell the wife
Gertie, you've never seen anything like it in your life
Come on out!
You've never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it
You've never seen anything like it in your life
It's a bicranium, madam.
Arthur! Charlie! Joe!
Come and have a look at this!
Beverly, get Joe!
I thought I'd seen every wonder in the world
I've seen the Colosseum in Rome and the Acropolis
I've made the biggest blunder in the world
'Cause I've never seen anything quite like this
Now look what you've done!
You've frightened him!
Hey, come back! Come back!
I'm down to earth
I'll tell you straight
I could tell you stories that would fascinate you
I know the trade
I know the tricks
I once bought an elephant for two pound six
Two pound six
Taught it tricks
But for your pushmi-pullyu
I'd pay three pounds
Four pounds!
Five!
'Cause I've never seen anything like it that's alive
I tell you what.
I'd even pay for it in cash.
Five? That wasn't exactly what we had in mind.
Because, you see, pushmi-pullyus are remarkable creatures
Of all God's animals they're the cleverest
They develop these remarkable features running up and down Mount Everest
- No!
- Yes! Absolutely true.
Runnin' up and down
Mount Everest?
Exactly. You see...
Running up and down the mountain gives them very nimble feet
Put them on the right rope
They could walk a tightrope
That should give the audience a rare old treat
And this extreme agility begets a rare ability
Shared only with the mountain goats of France
The pushmi-pullyu loves to dance
I'll give you anything you want.
- The terms are quite simple.
- Anything you want!
- Four-week engagement.
- Right!
- Share all profits equally.
- Right.
Two performances a day.
Oh, uh, no, uh, four performances a day.
Just a minute.
We have a problem.
Well, what do they want?
Three shows a day.
And four on Saturday?
They agree.
Done!
La, la-la, la
La, la, la, la, la
- My dear Dolittle!
- Oh, I'm awfully sorry.
You've never seen anything like it!
I've never seen anything like it.
Dolittle, me.
Thank you.
- Me.
- No, Dolittle.
I mean, you're not a fool
Neither am I
I could tell you stories that would stultify you
Open your eyes
What do you see
This thing's a miracle for you and me
Guarantee
I agree
Within a meager month
I've seen my wildest dreams come true
'Cause I've never seen anything like it nor have you
Oh, I've never seen anything like it
Never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it
In all my
Life
What's the matter with you, Sophie?
Come on, Sophie. Catch it.
Try again, Sophie.
Come on, Sophie.
- That's yours.
- Oh, thanks.
Right, well,
I'm off to the bank.
Ah, here we are now. "Seals are notoriously sentimental creatures.
Prolonged separation from those they love can result... in complete lack of interest in their usual activities."
That would explain why Sophie keeps dropping things in her act.
It isn't like her.
I'm sure she's pining for some reason.
I must go and have a chat with her.
This fellow obviously knows what he's talking about.
- Who wrote the book, Doctor?
- Uh, oh, I did.
- Hmm.
- Just a moment!
I have something to say to you,
- Mr. Dolittle.
- Doctor.
Doctor?
I've heard of some hypocrites in my time, but you are contemptible!
All that sanctimonious claptrap about protecting defenseless creatures, and here you are an animal trainer in a cheap circus!
Exhibiting freaks!
Come, lad. Why don't you go and make some cocoa?
- I don't want any cocoa, do you?
- I'd love some, lad. Yes. Off you go.
Hello, Fred.
He is... He's very rude.
Who, the doctor?
Oh, no, not at all. He's a darlin' man.
Did you hear what he said about my uncle?
Oh, that, yeah, well, he's a darlin' man, but he's very rude.
Of course, I wouldn't mind so much except everything he said was true.
You should never believe anybody who goes around tellin' the truth.
They're not to be trusted.
Ya have to do it both ends.
Otherwise it gets jealous.
He was too ashamed to say anything just now, of course.
- Too nice.
- Nice?
He's the kindest man on God's Earth, Fred.
He understands animals better than you and me will ever understand anythin'.
Well, I certainly don't understand him.
Ah, sure, now.
He's one of the beautiful people.
And I'm sure now he's one of the horrible people.
You're wrong, sweetheart.
I can't explain what it is that he is
But he is what he is for a very good reason
I can't explain why he does what he does
But he does what he does
'cause his heart is pure
Of that much
I am sure
I'm sure as I told young Tom the other day
He lives in a world of fantasy
And that is a world
I plan to see, fantasy
Can't you see
The world is full of beautiful things
Butterfly wings
Fairy tale kings
And each new day undoubtedly brings
Still more beautiful things
The world abounds with many delights
Magical sights
Fanciful flights
And those who dream on beautiful nights
Dream of beautiful things
Beautiful days for sunshine lazin'
Beautiful skies and shores
Beautiful days when I can gaze
In beautiful eyes
Like yours
Our lives tick by like a pendulum swings
Poor little things
Puppets on strings
But life is full
Of beautiful things
Beautiful people
Too
Beautiful people
Like
You
I see. I see.
I'm sorry. Hmm.
Ah, cocoa.
Come in, gentlemen.
You know Sophie, don't you?
Oh, yes, of course you do.
It seems we have a problem on our hands.
Sophie's just been telling me how much she misses her husband.
That's why she couldn't concentrate on her performance, just as I thought.
- Where is her husband?
- The North Pole. That's the problem.
They were on their way there when Sophie was captured.
If she doesn't get back to him, she feels she's going to go completely to pieces.
What do you want us to do?
Go to the North Pole?
Unfortunately, there isn't time, but it's very pleasant up there.
But the North Pole hasn't been discovered yet.
Not officially.
I'd never say anything about it.
I promised the polar bears I wouldn't.
Anyway, that's beside the point.
What we've got to do is to get Sophie back to her husband.
Now, if I could get her to the Bristol Channel, she could swim it in about a week.
You go along there, around that bit, then straight on and then slightly to the left.
Oh, that's great, but how does she get to the Bristol Channel?
- Well, she'd have to escape.
- Escape? A seal?
I can hardly go to Blossom and say she wanted to go to the North Pole to see her husband.
He wouldn't believe a word.
- You know something?
- What?
- She's gonna have to escape.
- Tonight.
Shh. Shh.
- Is everything all right, sir?
- It's my grandmother.
She's not very well.
I'm taking her to Bristol.
- Can you smell fish?
- Fish?
It's Granny.
She's on a special diet.
Very wise, sir.
Are you all right, dear?
Enjoying the trip?
Oh, that's good.
Whoa! Whoa!
What's the delay?
What's going on there?
Jack Fitch, the highwayman, has been seen on this road.
We have to search all coaches.
Help yourself.
You'll find no surprise in here.
All right, driver.
All right, get up.
All right, go on.
Come back here, Nelly!
Nelly, come back here!
Where are you going?
Where are you going, Nelly?
Come on back!
Come back here, I tell ya!
Well, here we are. Sorry it was such an uncomfortable journey, but it was really the only way.
There, there, there, Sophie.
Don't get upset.
I can't bear females who cry.
Shh. Don't look at me like that, Sophie, or I'll get upset too.
Dear Sophie, you understand so much, don't you?
When I look in your eyes
I see the wisdom of the world in your eyes
I see the sadness of a thousand good-byes
When I look in your eyes
Shh, shh.
And it is no surprise
To see the softness of the moon in your eyes
The gentle sparkle of the stars in the skies
When I look in your eyes
In your eyes I see the deepness of the sea
I see the deepness
Of the love, the love
I feel you feel for me
Autumn comes, summer dies
I see the passing of the years in your eyes
And when we part, there will be no tears, no good-byes
I'll just look into your eyes
Dear Sophie
Those eyes so wise
So warm, so real
Isn't it a pity you're a seal
Well, she's on her way.
- What did you throw her in for?
- She wanted to go back to her husband.
No, you don't understand at all.
She wasn't a woman. She was a seal.
- A seal?
- Yes.
Dressed in a bonnet and shawl?
That's right. Yes. I'd sort of borrowed it from this lady in the tavern.
The bonnet had a little brown ribbon through...
Never mind about the brown ribbons.
You then took the seal to Bristol in a stagecoach... and upon arrival promptly threw her over a cliff.
Exactly.
May one ask why?
Uh, certainly. Um, she wanted to go to the North Pole to see her husband.
- Her husband?
- Yes.
What makes you think this seal wanted to go to the North Pole?
- Well, she told me.
- She told you?
Yes, we discussed it in great detail.
Are you in the habit of talking to animals?
Yes, I am.
I do it all the time.
I thought perhaps you did.
With all due respect to
Your Worship, I think I detect a note of skepticism in the court.
I would, therefore, like an opportunity... to prove the point by talking to any animal you care to nominate.
Very well then.
My dog Rufus is outside. Bring him in!
Oh, that's very kind of you.
This way, please.
Oh, thank you very much.
Yes, Rufus will be only too happy to answer any questions you care to ask.
Oh, I think we can dispense with that formality.
Uh, ask him what I had for dinner last night.
Very well.
Did he?
Well, really? Did he?
Good Lord. Well, well.
Did he really?
Well, well, well.
What did he say?
I'm grateful that Your Worship acknowledges the fact that the dog was talking.
For dinner last night,
Your Lordship enjoyed the following:
Two helpings of boiled trout, four helpings of roast pheasant, roast potatoes, brussels sprouts and gravy,
Followed by six large portions of blackberry pie with whipped cream.
It's not true! I only had five helpings of blackberry pie!
Your Lordship also drank a great deal of wine and brandy... and later in the evening sang noisy songs with your friends about a woman from Swansea...
That's enough!
The court is adjourned until tomorrow morning, pending inquiries about the bonnet and shawl stolen from the tavern in question.
Hmm. Thank you.
Well, by my calculation, the trial will be over by 11:00 tomorrow morning.
Polynesia, how much did we earn from the circus?
206 pounds, seven and fourpence, halfpenny.
Ah, it's more than enough.
I see no reason why we shouldn't set out to find the pink sea snail right away.
Matthew, go to the house and pick up my clothes.
Have the boat ready to sail by 12:00.
We'll catch the noontide or whatever it's called.
We haven't got a crew, so we'll have to make due with you and Stubbins and the animals.
I can come too?
If your parents say so and you know how to tie a knot.
Hear that? We're going to help the doctor find the pink sea snail.
I should wait until you see his boat before you get too excited.
It isn't by chance it's called the Flounder.
No sailor in his right mind would touch it.
I'm not asking a sailor in his right mind. I was asking you.
What do you say?
I say that for a man who's about to be hanged for murder... to be gettin' ready to go on a pleasure cruise shows a very nice outlook.
- Fred!
- To what do we owe this, uh, pleasure?
- I've brought dinner.
- Dinner?
- Yes, for Matthew and Tommy.
- Oh.
Set it down there, Hubert.
Steak and kidney pie and oxtail and roast beef.
- Would you like some?
- Uh, no.
Oh, come on, Doctor.
Ya haven't had a bite all day.
- No, thank you.
- He's a vegetarian.
Oh, no!
It, uh, seems a pity to waste it.
It's all right, Matthew.
Um, carry on.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Come on, Tom.
Doctor?
Um, Rufus was right.
He did have six helpings of blackberry pie.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you, Chee-Chee.
It seems that a bonnet and shawl were, in fact, removed... from the tavern in question on the day in question.
The lady who owns them, for reasons best known to herself, has no wish to prosecute.
You are, therefore, acquitted of the charge of murder.
Thank you very much.
However, your performance in this courtroom in the past two days... has left little doubt in the minds of my distinguished colleagues and myself... that your lunatic activities with animals infringe upon the public safety... and are not to be tolerated.
Happily, Her Majesty's farseeing benevolence provides a sanctuary for sad people like you... who think they can talk to animals and want to treat them like human beings.
Therefore, it is the judgment of this court... that you be committed indefinitely to an asylum for the insane.
Have you anything to say?
I do not understand the human race
It has so little love for creatures
With a different face
Treating animals like people is no madness or disgrace
I do not understand the human race
I wonder why do we treat animals like animals
Animals treat us so very well
The devoted way they serve us and protect us when we're nervous
Oh, they really don't deserve us
All we give them is hell
Tell me how else man repays them
Do we ever think to praise them, no, we don't
And this dismays them
You can tell
We are riddled with ingratitude
We give no love or latitude
In every way our attitude is well, like animals
No, no. That's not what I mean. I mean...
Why do we treat animals like animals
How can people be so inhumane
Cows and chickens work to feed us
Dogs and horses show they need us
And though cats don't always heed us their affection is plain
What do we do, we neglect them
We do nothing to protect them
We reject them
Don't expect them to complain
We ignore them or we beat them
When we're hungry then we eat them
It's appalling how we treat them, it's insane
Like animals
We humiliate and murder and confine them
We create their wretched status
Then we use it to malign them
I mean, why should we say
Treat him like a dog
Why should we say
Working like a horse
Why should we say
Eating like a hog
When what we mean is
Eating like a man
Don't we, of course
A man of ill repute is called a weasel or a rat
A woman you dislike becomes a vixen or a cat
A family that is blessed with healthy reproductive habits
Occasions the remark, well, you know them, they breed like rabbits
He's as stubborn as a mule
He's as stupid as an ox
He's as slimy as a snake
He's as crafty as a fox
Remarks like that really get my goat
Why don't we say
Noble as a frog
Or why can't we say
Wealthy as a hen
True, we say
Devoted as a dog
What we should say is
Chic as a giraffe
Pretty as a pig, eh
That will be the big day, won't it
But when, but when
But when, when will we stop treating them like animals
Is the human race entirely mad
Women see a baby goatskin or a lambskin or a stoatskin
And to them it's just a coatskin
Oh, it's terribly sad
When you dress in suede or leather or some fancy fur or feather
Do you stop and wonder whether for a fad
You have killed some beast or other
That you're wearing someone's brother
Or perhaps it's someone's mother in which you're clad
Like animals
Like animals
Like animals
Well, it's true
We do not live in a zoo
But man is an animal too
So why can't you
Like me
Like animals
Animals
Now, the prison faces the road here.
So what we do is we tie the ropes from the bars of the cell to the elephant, and he pulls the whole wall off.
How can you go on the voyage if the doctor's still in prison?
We can't. That's why Matthew's got this marvelous plan to get him out.
Then this second elephant... he's bigger than the first elephant...
All the doctor has to do is step through the hole in the wall onto his back.
- You'll never get away with this.
- Listen, here's the clever part.
He slides down the elephant's trunk onto a waitin' rhinoceros and away they go!
Just the three of you are going off on this boat?
Oh, no. Chee-Chee, Polynesia and Jip are coming too.
Then there's these six tigers, you see, to stop anyone followin'.
To look for a pink sea snail?
They'll be standing on the other side of the road while I'm settin' off the dynamite.
- Dynamite?
- Oh, sure.
If we blow up the road, they'll have to go all the way around the town to get to the harbor, which gives me time to nip back here... and blow up the bridge while you're gettin' on the boat.
That's the beauty of this whole plan... its simplicity.
- Are they really going to keep the doctor in prison?
- Oh, no, no.
They're moving him across to the loony bin at 12:00.
- Today?
- Aye.
I've also an idea.
You get the boat ready.
Leave the doctor to me.
We sail at 12:00. Avast now.
Aye, aye, sir.
We're a fine bunch, takin' orders from a parrot.
Matthew, how did you enjoy the food I brought you in the prison the other night?
'Twas the best meal
I ever had in me life.
They say that prison food is terrible.
I won't hear a word against it.
I was thinking.
Wouldn't it be nice if you were to have those kind of meals on your voyage?
Oh, true now.
It would be marvelous.
The only way we could do that is if you was to...
If we was to, uh...
Ah!
I'll tell you one thing, Fred.
I only hope there's no stowaways on that boat.
Because if there was,
I wouldn't know where to look for them.
Anyway, once we're out at sea with an escaped convict, there's no turnin' back.
Oh, Matthew!
I love you!
Who would have thought that one little kiss
Soft and sweet from the lips of a lovely girl
Would to change my life
But by my life
It will
After today nothing will be the same again
After today I'll make my claim to fame and then
The grass will be greener
And the air will be cleaner
And my life be serener
Than heaven knows when
Heaven knows when
After today I shall have bid my fears good-bye
After today I shall have no more tears
To cry
I'll learn to live with laughter to stay
After
Today
After today nothing will be the way it was
After today I'll say
Oh, what a day it was
My heart will be lighter
And my smile will be brighter
And I'll be twice the fighter
That ever I was
Clever because
After today I shall have bid my fears farewell
After today I shall have no more tears
To quell
I'll learn to live with laughter
To stay
After the tears comes the laughter
After today
Chee-Chee.
Run! Run!
Stop!
Don't follow the doctor!
Don't obey! Don't obey!
Right!
Come on! This way!
Don't sit down!
- Get up!
- After them!
Go after him!
This way. Come on. After him. This way.
- This way! No, this way!
- Ta-ta.
- Stop them!
- Stop them! Stop them!
It's all right, Doctor.
You can come out now.
- There's not a policeman in sight.
- Oh, thank you, Matthew.
Makes a very good little reading room, this. I must use it more often.
Now, let's see where we are.
Ah, I see.
He says there's a faint smell of garlic coming from the southeast.
- What does that mean?
- It means we're about ten miles off the coast of France.
I've got about the best navigational system on the high seas today.
Jip's got this incredible sense of smell, and Polynesia gets marvelous weather reports from the passing birds and fishes.
- Everything all right at the house?
- Yes, Doctor.
Good. Keep an eye on everything and don't bump into anything like Ireland.
Aye, aye, Doctor.
- A very well organized escape.
Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
I doubt if there's a ship afloat with flowers like these.
Look at these geraniums.
Absolutely glorious.
Have you seen my azaleas on the starboard side?
- No, sir, I can't say as I have.
- They're doing wonderfully.
How are you enjoying life on the rolling deep?
If the good Lord meant us to take to water, He'd have given us flippers.
No, Stubbins, move your mouth about more.
You must reread my essay on basic chimpanzee, page one.
I must cut these roses back.
There's so much to do on a ship.
What a marvelous smell, Matthew.
What have you been cooking?
I'm absolutely starving.
Will this do?
Do come on while it's still hot.
What are you doing here?
I thought someone capable ought to look after Tommy on the voyage.
Stubbins is perfectly capable of looking after himself.
I must turn the ship around and go straight back to Puddleby... uh, well, immediately after lunch.
They'll, uh... They'll put ya inside if you go back, Doctor.
Oh, yes, that is a point.
What are we going to do with her if she stays?
You make me sound like a stray cat.
A cat would be most welcome.
Don't worry. It's vegetarian.
- It's delicious.
- It's marvelous.
Mmm. What is it?
- Algue marine en croute.
- Oh, yes.
- What's that in English?
- Seaweed pie.
Mmm! It's really rather good.
- Well, where are we going?
- To hunt for the great pink sea snail.
And where do you expect to find it?
I haven't the faintest idea.
But as one place is as good as another, it's high time we decided.
- Otherwise, when we get there, we won't know we've arrived.
- Good thinking.
- Thank you.
- Are your voyages always as well planned as this?
When possible. Unfortunately, one doesn't always have time to go into minute details.
- Such as knowing where you're going?
- That sort of thing.
But then how do you decide?
We play a little game I invented.
One of us opens the atlas at random, sticks a pin in the open page.
Wherever it lands, that's where we go.
- You can't be serious.
- I'm very serious.
That is the most ridiculous thing
I have ever heard of.
You could end up in all sorts of terrible places.
That's absolutely true.
I remember going to the Sahara Desert four times in succession... before I realized Chee-Chee had stuck down all the other pages of the atlas with jam.
Marvelous trips. Lots of sand.
But that is exactly what I mean.
It's all right now. I cleaned all the jam off. Little bit there.
How you can sit there and say what you're saying I just don't know.
I must admit the Sahara is one place
I'm praying we just won't go.
You know, that's absolutely typical of a woman.
There are so many fabulous faraway places to see
She makes one seaweed pie and goes mad.
Such as Mexico, Sweden
Hawaii, Japan and Capri
Who does she think she is?
There's so many exciting and wonderful places
Much more inviting than desert oases
Pleasant as home is it isn't what Rome is
So why stay there
When there are so many fabulous faraway places to see
As though the seaweed pie was all that marvelous.
Why should Spain and Tahiti and Rio
- Just be only names to you and me
- Is there any more?
I feel certain there are people we'd be glad to know there
So tell me why don't we get up and go there
Go to those fabulous places where we long to be
Go to Bangkok and Hong Kong and Paris and Venice
Tokyo and Cairo and Lisbon and London
Wonderful, fabulous places
We're longing to see
When I think of the warm Caribbean
I see a new world for you and me
I'd give anything just to have one single day there
Once we get there
I know that we'll stay there
Stay in those fabulous places where we long to be
-  Such as Siam
-  Sienna
-  Vienna
-  Verona
- Java, Jamaica
- Jamaica, Bombay
-  Barcelona
- Ole!
- Ole! Ole! Ole!
- El toro!
- Ha, ha!
- Ole! Ole! Ole!
Show me those fabulous places
I'm longing to see
My dear Miss Fairfax, you seem to have entirely missed the point.
I'm aware there are fabulous places wherever we sail
- Will we see them?
- We will.
But the point of the journey is science and finding the snail
An incomparable thrill
We shall question the sharks off the coast of Tobago
Interview swamp life in Tierra del Fuego
-  That sounds horrendous
-  No, no, it's tremendous and well worthwhile
We'll make detailed inquiries of every crustacean we meet
- Crustacean?
-  Shellfish, they're sweet
We will sail to the ends of the earth
Till our search for the snail is quite complete
We'll interrogate beetles and bugs in Nigeria
And if we have to spend weeks in Siberia
Eighty below but a place that we all ought to see
But I haven't brought the right clothes for Siberia
Those are the fabulous places you'll visit with me
Sounds as if we're in for a good time.
Well, Siberia is one place you'll never see me go
Stick in the pin
Where the pins goes, then we go
- Ireland!
- Romania!
- No, Ruritania!
We'll chase that sea snail from here to Tasmania
Show me those fabulous places
I'm longing to
I'm longing to
See
It doesn't count.
You landed in the sea.
No, she hasn't. Look. There.
Well, that doesn't look very interesting.
- What is it?
- "Sea Star Island.
Last reported position."
Last reported position?
What can that mean?
The Sea Star Island. That's faintly familiar. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
"Seashore, sea slug, sea snail.
Sea Star Island."
It's that floating island.
It moves all over the world like a ship.
It's a freak of nature.
This time of year it's sometimes sighted off the coast of Africa.
How terribly exciting.
I think you have chosen rather well.
I don't think it's exciting at all.
Couldn't we go to...
Couldn't we go to Monte Carlo?
Miss Fairfax, this is a serious zoogeographical expedition.
It's not a pleasure cruise for your personal benefit.
I promise to ask for no special privileges.
I promise to grant none.
A ship is no place for a woman.
The simple answer then is to treat me like a man.
I intend to.
Well, good-bye.
Twelve.
Uh-huh. How is the score, Stubbins?
And the arithmetic?
You're winning, sir, I think.
Ah, well, that's the first sure sign we've been at sea too long.
Polynesia spoke to some swallows.
They said there's a terrific storm up ahead. Isn't that marvelous?
No, it isn't.
Can't we drive round it?
I shouldn't think so.
The latest long-range fish forecast wasn't too encouraging.
Jip said he could smell thunder.
- I didn't know thunder had a smell.
- It does if you're a dog.
Uh, 82. Mind you,
Jip does tend to exaggerate.
If you ask me, bein' at sea is very much the same as bein' in prison, except at sea ya stand a better chance of drownin'.
That reminds me. One of the ship's rats came to see me this afternoon.
Said he had a distinct tingle in his tail, a sure sign the ship was going down.
So his lot are preparing to leave, according to rat tradition.
He highly recommended we should do the same.
There's nowhere we can go.
- Exactly. That's what I told the rat.
- Two.
- What was that?
- A bit of lightning. That's all.
When you finish clearing up, you better batten down the hatches and stay below.
Women are always scared stiff of storms.
Well, I'm not.
I'm a man, remember?
I dread to think what this is going to do to my azaleas.
August 10.
Signs of inclement weather.
Crew's morale remains high.
Steady as she goes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, indeed.
- Any sign of her, Polynesia?
- Not yet.
Ah, good morning, Stubbins.
Beautiful day.
Yes, sir, good morning.
What happened to the ship?
Very good question.
If we ever find enough bits, we'll put them together and find out.
Come on, Matthew.
Rise and shine.
I told ya Flounder was a terrible name for a boat.
Nonsense. The flounder's a most reliable little fish.
It's survived the sea for thousands of years.
Aye, below the surface.
Anyway, we're all safe.
That's the main thing.
- At least, we will be as soon as we find Miss Fairfax.
- Poor Fred.
I said all along a ship was no place for a woman.
Heaven knows I did my best to make the voyage pleasant for her.
You can't spend your life running after a woman, waiting on her hand and foot when there's important work to be done.
I think under the circumstances
I treated her very well.
Probably too well.
Spoiled her, in fact.
And I tied her very securely to that raft.
I hope she's all right.
That's all.
- We'll make a full-scale search as soon as we get ashore.
- Ashore?
Sea Star Island.
That's where we're going, isn't it?
Apart from the fact that we're shipwrecked, that we have no means of gettin' there, and that we don't know where it is anyway, yes.
You mustn't worry about things like that, Matthew.
By my calculations, we were sort of coming down in this direction like this, and the floating island was sort of coming down in that direction like that.
Then we sort of somehow or other sort of more or less meet... somewhere round about here.
Is that a fact?
Ah! There it is now.
Well, shall we go ashore?
Giddyap.
I must remember to get meself one of those.
Hmph. Any sign of Fred?
Not yet. I only hope she caught the island.
It won't be passing here again for months.
You and Stubbins search the beaches.
I'll go inland.
- Meet back here in two or three hours.
- Yeah. Tommy?
Polynesia, I want every living creature on this island looking for that girl.
Yes, Doctor.
- Every bird that can fly I want airborne until she's found.
- Yes, Doctor.
She can't be at sea.
We'd have heard from the fish by now.
- You sure she'll be all right, Polynesia?
- Yes, Doctor.
She's standing right behind you.
Good morning.
Oh, good morning.
Um, afraid we had a bit of a storm last night.
Thank you for telling me.
Pity you got lost. You could have given us a hand getting these ashore.
I'm sorry. I was fully occupied getting myself ashore.
No mind. We managed. Some of these books are very heavy though.
Saved all your books, I see.
- Yes, most fortunate.
- You lost all my dresses.
Yes, most unfortunate. I saw your trunk floating amongst the wreckage.
However, the outfit you're wearing this morning... is the nicest thing I've seen you in since you left England.
This is my underwear.
Oh. Anyway, it suits you.
I'm terribly glad to see you.
Are you?
Uh, well, we got a tremendous lot to do.
We've got to unload the raft, find food and build whatever it is one has to build.
- What are you trying to say?
- Hmm?
Why don't you say what you mean?
What do you mean, say what I mean?
For a month or more
I have listened and dreamed
While the moon has glistened and a million stars have gleamed
-  Waiting
- Waiting?
-  Waiting
- What for?
What for?  For a man
I know who is clever and kind
But a man who never ever seems to know his mind
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting for you to say you like me
Or hate me or miss me or kiss me or something
But nothing
Nothing do you say
At all
Little wonder I feel sorely neglected
Unwanted, rejected and small
Little more than two feet tall
Lucky to be here
At all
Emma?
I think I... like you.
Yes, I think I do.
I think I like you.
I'm almost sure that I do
I think I like the way you look
The way your eyes reveal your mind
Like a precious book that's hard to find
I think I'm learning something strange and new
But it's well worth learning
Because I'm learning about you
Like dawning sunshine
When a new day is due
I think I like you
And I think you like me too
Do you?
Do you?
Do you?
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.
Good heavens. I do believe that's a great crested oriental moonbird.
It's terribly rare.
I'm so glad we came.
Great crested oriental moonbird.
What a bit of luck.
Ah, that's better.
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.
The locals aren't a very friendly lot, are they?
I bet you anything you like they're going to kill us.
Whoever said children had beautiful minds had obviously never met you.
Bein' in prison is much the same as bein' on a boat, except in prison there's less chance of drownin'.
And less chance of our getting back to Puddleby.
I must have a serious talk to whoever runs this place.
I promised to get Stubbins home in time to go to school.
I'm sure if you tell them that we'll be out of here in no time.
Give me a leg up.
I want to see what's going on out there.
Good heavens.
All right, Matthew. Down.
- Why is it so cold?
- It's like being back in England.
There's a bit of frost. That's all.
It's quite clear what happened.
The storm that sank the Flounder must have blown the island off its usual course.
We're drifting too far north.
If we don't do something about it, that marvelous vegetation is going to die of frostbite.
To say nothin' of our dear selves.
This is obviously the gentleman to talk to.
Good morning.
Me Dr. Dolittle.
Search for great pink sea snail.
Small boy late for school.
Here very cold.
They all go home
Puddleby, yes?
What a funny accent.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Actually, that's what
I came to see you about.
My name is William Shakespeare, the Tenth. You may call me Willie.
Come with me, please.
Thank you.
We've had lots of shipwrecks, of course.
Being a floating island does tend to make us a bit of a danger to shipping.
We've bumped into lots of things over the years.
But on the credit side, it enabled us to build a marvelous museum... and public library... books and art treasures from all over the place.
Everybody on the island speaks nine or ten languages.
We even name our children after our favorite authors.
That's why my name is William Shakespeare.
Do forgive this paraphernalia.
We're rehearsing now
The Merchant Of Venice for our Shakespeare drama festival.
- Do sit down. Milk or lemon?
- Milk, please.
Must be a near perfect civilization.
Then what are we doin' in prison?
Purely a precaution, old boy, a sort of quarantine.
Most of the white men who have come here in the past... usually started killing people before they've been introduced.
- Extraordinary. Help yourself to sugar.
- Thank you.
But they never stay long.
They can't stand the peace and quiet.
I love peace and quiet, but unfortunately we won't be able to stay long either.
We've got to continue our hunt for the great pink sea snail.
You haven't by any chance heard of it being in the vicinity?
At the moment you have a bigger problem than looking for snails.
According to popular superstition, newcomers to the island are responsible for all our misfortunes.
So the elders of the village are blaming you for this frost.
I don't know what we can do about that. Perhaps there is something I can think of.
I do hope so for your sake.
You see, it's written here in the law book.
"He who brings sunshine to the coldness of our days... shall bask in the splendor of a thousand summers."
- That's very nice.
- Yeah.
Yes, but it goes on.
"He who brings winter into the summer of our lives... shall die the death of a thousand screams."
- Oh.
- I prefer the first one.
Yes, so did I.
The elders are also blaming you for what's happened to the animals.
What has happened to the animals?
They've all caught colds.
They're coughing and sneezing all over the place.
I must do something about this immediately. Come along, Polynesia.
We've got work to do.
Bless you.
Gesundheit.
Ha.
Here you are, Tommy. Another little baby lion for you to take care of.
Yes, sir.
Bless you.
That inhalant seems to be working very well.
Bless you.
I was hoping this mustard bath would work.
Still very hot.
How soon will my cough mixture be ready?
- Five minutes. Smell.
- Mmm!
I'd give it to the baby elephant first, if I were you.
- Why?
- She's got a terrible cold.
I want to control it before she gives it to the family.
When a herd of elephants start sneezing, it's like a hurricane.
Might drive the island even further off course. Thank you very much.
If we was to point them in the right direction, perhaps they could blow us back on course.
Pretty good theory, but terribly difficult to organize.
If elephants could swim, one good shove... and we'd be back in a southerly current before we could...
Why didn't I think of that before?
- They can swim.
- What, elephants?
No, no, no, Matthew. Tommy, what's as big as an elephant that can swim?
A whale, sir.
Exactly.
Emma, get on with the cough mixture.
Bless you.
Now, how do you get in touch with a whale?
I'll talk to him immediately.
Splendid.
Good morning. Marvelous, if the giraffe doesn't mind.
Extremely kind of you.
I do appreciate it.
Bless you.
You'll explain? Good.
Here he comes.
It was very decent of that turtle to put us in touch with him.
My word! He's a big fellow.
Now, if he gave a shove below us, that should just about do the trick.
Good morning.
One... shove... here.
We really must learn to speak a few words of whale.
Apparently they're very nice, but nobody ever talks to them.
Look!
Why is it doing that?
The island is bound to roll a bit after that shove.
It set that balancing rock in motion.
- It'll soon calm down.
- That would be highly desirable.
It says here in the law book,
"He who causes the great rock to fall into the hot mountain... shall die the death of 10,000 screams."
- Uh, how many screams did you say?
I shouldn't have thought it was worth more than five.
- I cannot tell you how upset I am about this.
- You're upset?
We realize it isn't your fault.
I've been through the law book from cover to cover.
There is nothing I can do.
- This is the tradition.
- Oh, well, we hate to break a tradition.
I once heard a story about a tribe that burned people alive, then et them for dinner.
I bet that's what they're going to do to us.
Will you please put a curb on your lurid imagination?
I'm sorry about this, Emma.
It hasn't been very relaxing the last few days, has it?
I think we've bumped into something.
Stop!
Release them!
Holy Pat.
What did we do now?
We've collided with the mainland.
The two pieces fit perfectly.
- How extraordinary.
- Not really.
The oldest legend of the island has always maintained... that we are a bit of Africa that has been missing for 5,000 years.
Is there a reward for finding it?
Oh, indeed, yes.
"He who brings back the lost island from the sea... shall live as a god for a thousand moons."
Thank you. Thank you.
That's very pleasant, but if you will excuse me,
I must get back to the hospital, in case the elephant sneezes and blows all the other patients away.
What will you do when the animals are all well again?
I have one great ambition.
I came to find a great pink sea snail.
I intend to find it.
The great pink sea snail is more than mythical.
I always thought that, too, Willie.
No, no. You can see the animals as they come out.
- Guard the gate, Matthew.
- Oh!
Come on. Come on.
- Why does he have the animals in there?
- All right, all right.
I'll tell ya.
Behind these gates is the most wonderful place in all the world.
- Can we see it?
- Can we see it?
- Shh!
- Shh!
This is the world of Dr. Dolittle
The wonderful world of Dr. Dolittle
Where crocodiles talk and elephants sing
And animals do most any old thing
Where polar bears wear top hats
And leopards with spots wear spats
Well, that's life in the world of Dr. Dolittle
Doves start to coo when they see Dolittle
He has a profound philosophy
If animals can be friends says he
Well, then why can't we
Matthew, open the gate.
Come on, baby. Up!
See they're all right, Matthew.
Say how do you do to the world of Dr. Dolittle
Say how do you do to the world of Dr. Dolittle
Life is a zoo to Dr. Dolittle
Life is a zoo to Dr. Dolittle
Where antelopes lope
-  And ostriches fan
-  And ostriches fan
And kangaroos do what kangaroos can
To make the hyenas laugh
As long as a long giraffe
Every calf starts to moo when they see Dolittle
Even the few who used to moo little
For all of the birds and beasts agree
He has a profound philosophy
And so why can't
We.
All of the birds and beasts agree
He has a profound philosophy
And so why can't we
Do little things to help them
Why
Can't
We
Oh.
Well, thank goodness they only had head colds.
Think how terrible it would have been if they'd had sore throats.
Our last two patients.
Well done, Emma.
Well, not a sniffle left on the island.
Interesting noise. Can't be.
You mean, the great pink sea snail...
Precisely, and by the sound of it, he seems to have caught a chill too.
So sorry.
I've never seen anything like it.
- Yes, I see.
Well, just a minute. Amazing!
- What is?
We've been searching for weeks for the great snail.
He's been with us all the time.
Lives in an underground cave and moves about with the island.
I was quite right. He's got a shocking cold. I told him I was a doctor, and if he'd come on the beach,
I'd mix him a batch of my special tonic.
It'll need to be rather large, won't it?
What's that?
- What is it?
- He's purring.
Thrilled with his medicine. Feels much more relaxed, almost like a new snail.
- Wanted to know if there's anything he can do for us.
- Is there?
Yes, he can take you all safely back to Puddleby.
Oh, well. Well, that's a bit of an imposition.
Puddleby's a long way away. All you did was give him a little medicine.
He's 2,000 years old.
He's lonely. It'll be company for him.
He'd been planning to visit his cousin in Scotland for 300 years and put it off.
Be a great opportunity for him.
- His cousin in Scotland?
- You've heard of the Loch Ness monster?
- Yes.
- Well, it's a cousin.
- Good heavens.
- Travel under the sea?
But it's bad enough on top.
We'd all drown, Doctor.
No, the shell is completely watertight.
It'll be like traveling in a big pink bubble.
Yes, he says he can get you back to Puddleby by two weeks from Tuesday.
This must be the only snail in the world with four bedrooms.
Oh, and, Polynesia, don't forget to remind the snail to surface twice a day for his cough mixture.
It will fix up his cold, and stretch your legs and get some sea air.
- Yes, Doctor.
- Oh, good.
I'd hate to miss my turn on deck.
And, Chee-Chee, don't eat all the bananas. Leave some for the others.
Shh, shh. Don't be sad.
That's all, sir.
Good-bye, Stubbins.
Go up to the house whenever you like.
Yes, sir. And, Doctor, come home soon, sir.
Well...
Well, I'll, uh... I'll send your other high hat back from Puddleby, Doctor.
The snail can bring it back with him.
Yours is looking a little grubby now.
You'll probably find it a bit difficult to get one here.
Yes, uh, probably.
Well, thank you, Matthew.
Well, uh, good-bye.
Bye.
Uh, give my love to everyone at home, to Gub-Gub and Dab-Dab and everyone.
Good-bye, John Dolittle.
Take care!
Well, Tom, I still wish he was comin' with us.
I've never driven one of these things before.
Sure you won't change your mind and come with us?
I can't, Emma. Your uncle will put me away the moment I set foot in Puddleby.
But you have to come back one day.
I hope so. A lot of animals depend on me.
One or two people too.
Puddleby's going to seem very dull after all this excitement.
I mean, what are you going to do here?
I think I'll start planning my next voyage.
Where are you going this time? The moon?
- Very probably, yes.
- You're not serious.
- Oh, yes.
- How?
On the giant lunar moth.
Magnificent creature.
Flies backwards and forwards between the earth and the moon.
When it reaches one, it's attracted by the light of the other and flies back again.
Willie tells me there's one on the island.
My idea is to build some sort of saddle arrangement,
- very secure, so I don't fall off halfway.
- Can I come?
Hmm?
Can I come with you?
Emma, I'm afraid...
I'm not very good with people.
L... I'm all right with animals, but people...
I'm not very good with.
I never have been.
I don't know why.
I'll write to you.
I'll organize an air postal service with the seagulls.
I'll miss you, John Dolittle.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, Tom.
If we ever drown in this thing, it'll be in a flood of tears.
Sophie. What are you doing here?
No. Oh, how do you do, sir?
Really? Good Lord.
Sophie, that's marvelous news.
Thank you very much, indeed.
Good-bye, Sophie.
Thank you. Thank you!
"Good night, sweet Prince, and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest."
Willie! Willie!
Wonderful news.
Sophie, the seal, and her husband have come to tell me... all the animals in England are on strike.
They refuse to do any work until I'm reprieved.
- You can go home?
- Yes. The local magistrate is begging me to go back.
The whole country's paralyzed without the animals.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.
I think that tree is about the right size.
It's a 60-foot overall wingspan.
- But you've missed the snail.
- I've got a better idea.
I'm going to fly home.
Can you imagine their faces when they see me on the quayside waiting for them in Puddleby?
- Fly home?
- Since you say there's one on the island, on the lunar moth.
- Help me make a model so I can gauge where to put the saddle.
- Certainly.
I've got to allow for a very steep rate of climb.
Now, you see, you'll be the wings.
All of you. That's it.
Just sit down inside those lines I've just drawn.
Everybody. That's the idea.
Good. Yes, I think it's going to work splendidly.
As soon as I've built this saddle, we'll go and have a chat with the lunar moth.
I only hope he understands common house moth. That's all I speak.
Then as soon as the moon comes up, we'll be off to Puddleby.
Wonderful night for flying.
By my calculations I should be home in time for breakfast.
The stars are made of lemon drops
The bigger ones are lollipops and ice
The clouds have shops up on the tops
That sell you sweets and soda pops
What do they call the place
Isn't it paradise
Maybe what the doctor tells me
Isn't altogether true
But I know every tale he tells me
I don't know any better ones
Do you
My friend the doctor says the world is full of fantasy
And who are you and I to disagree
Let's hope and pray that is the way
The life we love will always stay
For my friend the doctor
And me
- Did you see my cane?
- Yeah, it was right there.
It's gone.
- You didn't see it, did you?
- What?
My cane.
- Shit.
- It's gone.
- Is it here?
- It's not there. I left it right there.
When? Today?
- Oh, it's in back of this door.
- He's got it.
It's in back of this door here.
Will you remember?
Can you smoke here?
London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down
London Bridge is falling down
My fair lady
- You came here two years ago, didn't you?
- Yes, I did.
What's the reason for the change this time?
Why are you so big this time?
What do you think?
I have absolutely no idea.
I don't even know about it.
I figured just do the same thing I did before.
What's happening here?
What are we gonna do?
How long is it since you were last in London?
- About a year.
- About a year.
- What's your light bulb for?
- What's the light bulb for?
I thought you would ask me that.
No, I usually carry a light bulb.
Somebody gave it to me, you know?
Sorry, I didn't quite catch the answer.
Somebody gave it to me, a very affectionate friend.
I see.
Are you the folk?
- Who? Am I folk?
- Yeah.
No, no, no. Not me, I'm not folk.
What is your real message?
My real message?
Keep a good head and always carry a light bulb.
Well, I plugged it in my socket and the house exploded.
Do you think a lot of the young people who buy your records understand a single word of what you're singing?
- Sure.
- You reckon they do?
Sure.
Why do you say they do?
How can you be so sure?
They're quite complicated songs, aren't they?
Yeah, but they understand them.
How do you know they do?
Have they told you?
They told me, haven't you heard of that song?
"She said so..."
- What did it say?
- You got it wrong.
Do you think they don't understand you because they don't see you?
Would you say that you cared about people particularly?
Well, yeah, but we all have our own definitions of all those words.
"Care" and "people" and...
Surely, I mean, we know what people are.
Well...do we?
You sound angry in your songs, are you protesting against certain things that you're angry about?
I'm not angry.
- I'm delightful.
- I see.
- Thank you very much.
- OK.
Do you ever read the Bible?
What about the Bible?
Do you ever read the Bible?
- No.
- Have you ever read it?
Have I ever? I've glanced through it.
Because, you see, a lot of the things you say...
I've glanced through it, I haven't read it.
Put your hands up to your face.
Like that?
Well, as I was saying to him...
- I can't pose.
- You don't have to pose.
Just do it and I'll shoot.
- And again.
- Sorry?
- Be all solemn.
- I can't do it.
We publish these things, you know.
You're so cute, you know.
- Your name, please?
- Joan Baez.
Joan“.
B, A, E, Z.
Strewth!
- I didn't recognize you, I'm sorry.
- Good.
Nice to see you,
I've been looking for you all day.
This is the part where I don't write.
I'm not gonna...
Anything that happens now, I'll just remember.
Whereas, when I'm living, doing my own thing, doing what I do, this is never around me.
I mean, I accept everything, I accept this...
Why?
Because, it's here, it's real, it exists, just as much as the buses outside exist.
I mean, I can't turn myself off to it because if I try to fight it
I'm just gonna end up going insane faster than I eventually will go insane.
If I do go insane.
When and if the time comes... for me to go insane.
"Puffing heavily on his cigarette, he smokes 80 a day."
I'm glad I'm not me.
- D'you know that song, Sally?
- Yeah, I like it.
Donovan. Who is this Donovan?
Let's put him right on the sideboard.
- He's a good guy.
- I'd like to meet him.
- He's a young Scottish...
- Bloke.
I was gonna say that but I didn't know if you'd understand.
- Bloke.
- Bloke. Anyway, he's singing bit of folk music and he's a very good guitar player.
- He's better than you.
- Yeah.
- All right?
- Right away I hate him.
He's all right, I like him anyway.
He's not a fake. He's all right.
- Well, I got him up on the wall. Anybody I...
- Where?
He's right there.
"Is Donovan deserting his fans?"
He's only been around for three months.
That's what I call a loser.
No, I'm serious. No, listen...
- In the South, they get it.
- London, they get it. London...
It's ridiculous to say that.
They've done so much...
In a short time. That's America, we're talking about England.
When did Abraham say that we're all equal?
When was the Declaration?
- That was 200 years ago.
- Well, he said that, didn't he?
- He said that but he never does nothing.
- Nobody ever does without the vote.
...started working 26 years ago...
Where we going to, CBSO?
- He's not with us.
- He's not with us.
We're all thin, he's...
I've got an award for him for the most... promising artist of the year and the best-selling folk record, Freewheelin'.
- I just don't want them.
- Just have them mailed?
- I don't even wanna see them.
- OK. All right.
Tell them to give it to Donovan.
Groovy, man!
Donovan.
Donovan, next target.
He's our target for tomorrow.
This is for the African Service of the BBC,
Mr. Dylan.
West African listeners and it's going out this evening.
And the questions are four in number for your approval before we ask them.
The first one's a very general journalistic one.
Just how did it all begin for you?
What triggered it off?
How do you see the art of the folk song in contemporary society?
Has it a very real social impact?
Something that will certainly interest our listeners in Africa is your deeply humanitarian attitude to a number of public matters.
For instance, you are quoted as saying,
"People talk about negroes as if they were objects."
Does this sort of compassion on your part present any problems for you in America?
OK.
By the way, you took part in a play in Britain some time ago,
- by a school friend of mine, Evan Jones.
- Oh, yeah.
Evan and I went to school in Jamaica together.
Castle Street, wasn't it?
- Yeah, the Madhouse on Castle Street.
- Yes.
Going ahead in about five seconds from now, with this interview with Mr. Bob Dylan for the African Service of the BBC.
Pete Myers and Colin Wilde producing, in approximately five seconds.
How did it all begin for you, Bob?
What actually started you off?
Sentence.
"He is not so much singing as sermonizing."
Colon. "His tragedy, perhaps, is that the audience is preoccupied with song."
Paragraph. "So the bearded boys
"and the lank-haired girls,
"all eye shadow and undertaker make-up,
"applaud the songs and miss, perhaps, the sermons,
"they are there." Colon.
"They are with it."
Sentence.
"But how remote they really are from sit-ins and strikes and scabs
"and life." Paragraph.
"'The times, they are a-changing', sings Dylan.
"They are when a poet and not a pop singer fills a hall."
Be aware that tonight at the City Hall here, you had a greater audience than has been seen there for many years.
And more appreciation than has been heard there.
I've never heard so much applause here.
That makes me feel good, you know.
Makes me feel good.
Are you religious?
Well, what does that mean, "religious"?
Does it mean you bow down to an idol or go to church every Sunday or that kind of stuff?
- No.
- Believe in something.
- Do you believe in...
- I don't believe in anything, no. Why should I?
I don't see anything to believe in.
Do you think you're cynical?
No, I just can't see anything anybody's offered me to believe in that I'm gonna put all my trust and faith in.
Nothing is sacred.
- Who is in charge?
- In charge of what?
Who is in charge of this room?
What do you mean, in charge of this room?
It's rented to Bob Dylan.
- Are you Bob Dylan's manager?
- Yes, but I'm not in charge of his room.
- No, you're in charge of Bob Dylan.
- No, I'm not.
We have had complaints about the noise above, below...
That's unfortunate, we'll try to hold it down.
If it isn't organized within five minutes,
I will ask you to leave.
- Why don't you get a constable?
- I will.
Please do.
There's been no noise in this room.
You're one of the dumbest assholes
I've ever spoken to.
If we were someplace else
I'd punch you in your goddamn nose.
You stupid nut.
We've rented this room and I'm asking you to leave.
We have valuables in here and I don't want you in here.
Don't adopt that attitude.
Would you get out of this room?
You get out of this room also.
I don't care about your fop manager.
As soon as we're clear of the town...
There's one in there. Shall I read it out?
"American folk singer Bob Dylan sat scowling in a hotel armchair last night.
"In his hands was an iris.
"Bob, who arrived 90 minutes before his British tour was to open at Sheffield City Hall,
"said he wanted to rest.
"Asked to pose for a relaxing picture, he seized a flower and said, 'This is how I like to relax.
"'I've been through all this in the States.'
"The harsh, rasping, haranguing voice of self-styled guitar-strumming poet Dylan
"started with The Times They Are A-changin'.
They certainly are.
"This, swears my 17-year-old son,
"is what the kids who used to scream at the Beatles now go for,
"and if Dylan is a trend, not just a cult, parents need not be so condescending.
"His tour, opening at the 2,700-seat hall was a sellout
"but without one single scream and rapt attention to every word. It was very impressive.
"Dylan, alone with his guitar and mouth organ for an hour and a half, earned himself £2,000
"and a foot-stamping ovation."
That's all.
- Where you staying tonight?
- Hotel.
- Where?
- Near the theater.
In a hotel?
- You staying in a hotel?
- Don't be personal.
- Is that him?
- No.
- Isn't he handsome?
- Isn't he lovely?
Pinch me, pinch me.
Come down.
My dream's come true.
Are you gonna sing
Times They Are A-changin'?
You want me to sing that, huh?
- You really like that song?
- It's fantastic.
What do you like about it?
I don't like any of the
Subterranean Homesick Blues.
You're that kind of person,
I understand right now.
It's not you, it doesn't sound like you at all.
My friends were playing with me on that song.
I have to give some work to my friends.
You don't mind that, right?
You don't mind them playing the guitar and drums and all that kind of stuff with me?
It just doesn't sound like you, it sounds as if you're having a good old laugh.
Don't you like me to have a good old laugh once in a while?
Some people might take you seriously and think...
You know different, though, right?
Yeah.
As long as you know, you don't have to worry about anybody else.
People take care of themselves.
Got any brothers and sisters?
Have you any brothers and sisters?
God, I don't even know that.
I have lots of brothers and sisters.
Lots.
I've got a little sister, she's mad on you.
Is this called Merseyside?
Yeah.
What the hell's wrong with the mic?
You can't hear him.
What the hell's happened?
- No sound here at all.
- OK.
Nobody's pulled anything out, except that one.
For crying out loud.
Is he down there?
Is he down there?
This one was off as well.
Bob Dylan in the number 16 slot with his own composition, entitled,
The Times They Are A-changin'.
Caroline fans...
- What number was the other one?
- What?
- What number was the other one?
On the fab chart.
Straight across the front.
We do...
- about 20, 30 of your numbers.
- Really?
We give them all a big band sound.
You probably think we're ruining your material but we're doing it because we're idols of you.
Thank you.
Are you playing around anywhere?
When we play we try and tell them it's the words they ought to listen to.
You play with rhythm guitar and electric guitar?
Yeah.
We find it's very difficult to get people to listen to words, all they want to do is listen to...
I don't really... It's beyond me.
I don't... I just go out there and sing 'em, if the people are...
If I was booked to play,
I just go out there and sing.
I'm not gonna try and get anybody to listen.
Step over here.
Oh, bless his heart!
Let him have a bit of room. That's it.
Bye.
See you now.
See you later.
Oh, God.
- Watch out, watch out!
- That chick is on the back of the car.
- There's a guy on our car, will you get him off?
- Get that ch... Take her off.
- Hey, Bobby, tell the guy to stop.
- She's gonna get hurt.
It's a girl.
Take that girl off our car, please.
Will you please take her off the car?
You gotta get her off.
Will you get that girl off our car?
She's off.
OK, how you doing?
We'll see you later. Bye.
I don't remember that song.
I haven't touched that song. Did I?
- Do you remember any more?
- No, I never finished it.
Oh, God. You finished it about eight different ways.
Yeah.
- That's a good song.
- It's beautiful.
If you finish it, I'll sing it.
I can finish that.
Have you ever heard
She Died For Love At 3am?
Bill Anderson wrote it.
It's a great song. You remember that song in the Shadows Of The Warm Red Wine?
Oh, that's it. That was it.
- It's another verse. "I'm a rolling stone..."
- Yeah.
What about the...
Welcome home.
It's the first time this room hasn't been full of insane lunatics, man, that I can remember.
Bobby, it was almost so nice that you don't know.
Yeah, it's the first time it's been cool around here.
Oh, God. I'm sleepy. I mean I'm fagging out.
Let me tell you, sister, you were fagged out a long time ago.
Sure.
You fagged out before you even thought you were fagged out.
Oh, my God, there she is - Fang.
Do you have one of those see-through blouses?
She has one of those see-through blouses that you don't even wanna.
- Such pain, Baez!
- You wouldn't hurt his guitar, would you?
- Oh, pardon me.
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
Do you have somewhere maybe
I can write out these things?
- Do you have any paper?
- Oh, yeah. OK.
- You'll have to make the most of that.
- Really? Do we have any more?
Are you expectin' to get it all written on that paper'?
I've got all these songs written.
Have to write small or something.
Can I finish this?
Come on.
On with Queen Lucy.
Out of place, baby!
Crowned my daughter queen of the festival.
Did you see that man on the platform, reachin' in his pocket, pulled out a speech and said,
"So happy to be here."
Wanna do it now'?
Oh, concert.
I knew there was something.
I knew it wasn't the hotel.
Where is it?
What kind of money?
How far do you think we can push them?
I tell you, as far as Granada goes, they were talking 12, 1300 pounds.
- There's 1500 there, I know.
- You don't think we can do better?
Possibly, yeah, but I know that he's talking 12, 13.
Why don't we ask for 2,000?
Well, I had that figure in mind, strangely enough.
Get it settled.
Great.
- Why don't we get an answer?
- Right.
Tell them that I have to present it to Bob before we can give them an answer,
- but we'll give it to them by tomorrow.
- Fine.
I'll get Johnny and Granada. The other one was Rediffusion, but they're the same...
Johnny, please, urgently.
Wherever he is, track him down, dear.
He's in the studio, but his secretary said if you could hold, she might get him to the phone.
Just say "Bob Dylan", he'll be there in a shot.
Two grand, Johnny. Yeah, on an exclusive.
And it would be very much exclusive - he's not going to do anything else. Yeah.
You want to leave that with you, John?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Yes?
- This is Chris, Stuart's PA.
- Yes, Chris?
- He's not been available at the moment.
He's a bit tied-up down at the theater.
Can I help?
I think he may untie himself. Tell him this is the call he was expecting regarding Bob Dylan.
- Bob Dylan?
- Yes.
Well, you know, when I say he's tied-up,
I really mean it. I'm not kidding.
I know he is...with rope.
Right?
No, we've got another show on in the theater, you know.
Don't get upset, don't get upset,
I'm only kidding you.
OK. I'll try and get him.
Will you tell him, Chris, that I have
Mr. Grossman with me, Bob's manager?
He's with me now.
- OK.
- OK. Bye.
How about that? He thinks I'm putting him on.
What do you think, Stuart?
Oh, dear.
Now for the two...
Not bad for me.
I'd take it for a week's work, I don't mind.
Stuart, shall I just check this out now with Albert, to save you hanging on?
Then give you a call back? God bless you.
1,250. He probably could stretch to fifteen hundred.
So I'd think of this, you know. BBC.
Maybe for one show, but not for two.
I had a feeling that Granada would come up with the best money. They have in the past.
That's what they offered Peter, Paul and Mary for two shows on the BBC.
This seems to be their...their top.
I think we really...
If you get him back, why don't you let me take a crack at him on the phone?
Pleasure.
Because he called me in the States, you know.
- Who? Stuart or Johnny?
- Stuart.
Stuart? All right.
Stuart, I've got Mr. Grossman for you.
Will you hold on a second?
I spoke to you in New York, didn't I?
It's the number, yeah.
And at that time I indicated the kind of money that we're looking for for Bob, and I assumed that when Tito told me that you were interested, that we were somewhere in that vicinity.
And I was personally kind of surprised at the nature of the offer.
And much as we'd like to do a show for the
BBC, I think we can't consider it at that money because it doesn't come anywhere near the other offers that we have.
Well, the minimum that I would consider would be the fee that you mentioned for each half-hour.
No, no. I wouldn't. 1,250 for each half-hour.
Well...
Thank you very much. Bye.
He says he'll put it to them, but it almost certainly will be...
But I think he's got to come back with 2,000 for that. For two shows.
Then we're no better off.
We're still better off with the other one with one show. Aren't we?
I don't know.
Can we, without being in bad taste, can we get Johnny back on the phone and tell him it looks like we have a better offer from...
I'll tell him.
No?
Albert, if I may... Go along with me. Because
I know Johnny and Johnny's a good guy.
Johnny is not about to save them money, you know.
We only asked for two. He's not going to come back with more than that.
He hasn't said, "We'd like to give you a little more than you asked for."
What we can do is this. If we want to hold on,
Johnny will be back in the morning.
If he comes up with the two and if they turn around and say, "Forget it"...
If they come up with two, I'll say, "Johnny, because Albert wants to do it with you,
"we're not saying no to you and doing the other one, we'll tell you what happened.
"We were ready to do yours if you came up with two,
"but then the BBC got mad and came up with two,
"so you've got to top it."
Albert. Stuart, I'll be with Albert in a few moments and I'll put it to him, and, you know, I'm sure he'll come up with a decision very quickly.
Well, now, Stuart, let me tell you...
Yeah. No, let me tell you something, Stuart, between you and I.
Very truthfully, as you know, two months ago,
Granada came on when they heard he was coming.
And you know them, they pay, you know...
Well, they pay for the taxi as well, if you know what I mean.
And they've been on there hammering away like mad.
So Albert does have a pretty tough decision in a way.
Yeah, but have you seen today's chart?
Dylan, number six,
Subterranean Homesick Blues.
Yeah, it jumped from like 45 or something to six.
I'll be with Albert within ten minutes or so.
- Which one'?
- This one right there.
Do you believe that guitar?
They don't have those guitars in the States, man.
They're incredible. 20 grand?
Here he comes.
- I don't know.
- Had it cut down, dead long sideboards.
Do you think the bottom rule of it is you dislike me?
No, but there's some people that might.
Oh, no. You know, I've got my friends.
I mean, I'm, you know, I'm well situated.
What about before you had any friends?
Were you worried then?
I was not worried. I wasn't worried about it, no.
I was lucky. Weren't you?
What was it like when you didn't have any friends?
I can't remember not having any friends.
- Have you got a lot of friends now'?
- No.
Because I reached a stage where I suddenly realized what a friend was, and then I probably had one or two.
Before that,
I didn't understand what a friend was.
Now, do you talk to them?
- I didn't know who they were then.
- Do you talk to your friends?
There are one or two people who I believe I can talk to.
That's why your friends are your friends, because you can talk to them?
- I think a friend is a friend because...
- Communicate with them?
To a certain extent.
They understand me more than anybody else.
We come from two different worlds, you come from England, I come from the US.
That's true, but we're still human beings and there's some sort of connection between us.
No, I'm just a guitar player, that's all.
Man, you're trying to knock me.
No, believe me, I'm not trying to do that.
When somebody comes to interview you, what's your attitude?
You read those interviews that were done on the first few days I was here.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Those weren't right.
You know that, right?
You know that was all...lies.
Well, I don't know.
Lies and rubbish. You know that.
After the first few lines, I didn't read much of it.
Why I came in here, I don't know.
Being regaled with all this...
- Are you going to the concert?
- Yeah, I'm gonna watch.
- I mean, this is what I came to see...
- Well, listen. OK, listen.
I came to see you but I thought
I'd like to have a word with you first.
What is your attitude to life? When you meet somebody, what is your attitude to them?
- I don't like them.
- You don't like them?
I mean, I come in here, what's your attitude towards me?
I don't have attitude towards you at all.
Why should I? I don't even know you.
No, but it would be an attitude if you wanted to know me or didn't want to know me.
- Why should I want to know you?
- That's what I'm asking.
I don't know. Ask me another question.
Just give me a reason why
I should want to know you.
- I might be worth knowing.
- Why? Why?
Tell me why. What difference is it gonna make for me to know you?
Name me one thing I'll gain.
You might learn something from my attitude to life.
- What is your attitude to life?
- I can't explain that in two minutes.
All you're getting is two minutes. You're asking me to explain something in two minutes too.
You're the artist, you're supposed to be able to.
- I am?
- Yeah.
- What about you? Aren't you an artist?
- Oh, no.
- What are you?
- I'm a science student.
- Let's hear it again. A what student?
- A science student.
What does that mean?
Just what does that mean?
What do you do?
What's your purpose in the world?
- What's my purpose in the world?
- Yeah.
- What do you do in the world?
- I'm in the world for me, I guess.
- Like everybody else.
- Just like me.
- So we're just alike, aren't we?
- I guess so.
- We don't come from two different worlds.
- You were wrong. I was right.
All the time.
But this is interesting.
When I go to interview some groups, if I go to interview Alan and his mob, I don't think they could care less about me, you know.
Well, you know, haven't you ever stopped to wonder why?
There's got to be some reason, doesn't there?
But it's nothing to do with me because they don't want to know me before I go in.
- They don't know me...
- What are you after?
Can you write them up in your paper?
- No, I don't think of myself as necessarily...
- Get into the science.
- I'm a person, you know.
- Well, so what?
There's a million thousand billion of us, so many persons outside.
- I agree.
- You can't know them all, can you?
No. But if I meet somebody,
I speak to them for a few minutes, then I think, "That guy might be able to give me something."
Well, there's...
Now I'm getting down to it.
Yeah. What is it that you want?
Everyone is out for what they can get.
Well, I might be able to get something material.
Do you want to get a chick?
Do you want to pick up a chick?
I don't want it. I don't want it.
I don't want it. I can't play the thing.
- I don't want it either.
- Well, I can't play it.
They may give me something material, but I'm not necessarily interested.
- What do they give you spiritually?
- I might learn something.
- What do you want them to give you?
- Well, I won't know if I don't try to find out.
Why don't you try?
Don't you ever... Do you ever just be quiet?
- Be silent?
- Yeah.
And just watch and don't say one word.
Yeah, the whole thing that gets me about you and about Alan, is that you're knocking from the minute I come in.
- Knocking?
- Yeah.
I don't think you know when you're liked, that's all.
If we wanted to knock you, we could put you on.
Yeah, but I mean he's just said that I'm talking a load of rubbish.
I never said that, you're misquoting me already.
I didn't misquote you, I interpreted you.
You interpreted him to your own... to your own thing, right?
- Your own rules, of your own images.
- I had to give some answer.
Why? Why do you have to give some answer?
- Well, to satisfy you.
- You don't have to satisfy me.
Besides, it's impossible!
You should have said you didn't want an answer.
- Do you try to satisfy everybody?
- No.
Do you every once in a while, try?
- Once in a while try to satisfy somebody?
- Somebody, not everybody.
- A few people.
- But some people I can't satisfy.
No matter how hard I try,
I couldn't satisfy them.
How do you know that?
If you get to know somebody for a little while, you can guess just how...
Are you still friends with them, even though you can't satisfy them?
Yeah.
- Friends. Not deep friends.
- What do you talk about?
You find a field on which you can communicate.
What's a deep friend?
Somebody that you're on almost exactly the same plane with them, so you can communicate with them very well.
Somebody that's just like you.
- No.
- Looks like you?
- No.
- No?
- Talks like you? How do you like somebody?
- No. Thinks the same way.
Thinks the same way? Like what? Like people think... Both are happy about a green door?
- No, think in the same language.
- Think in the same language?
So you can understand each other.
And you know what each other think.
Let's try to understand each other, shall we?
That wouldn't be a bad idea.
It wouldn't be a bad idea.
How are we going to understand each other?
You can ask your first question. Go ahead, you've got a question to ask, come on.
- No.
- You haven't got a question?
- But I didn't...
- I think somebody's calling for you.
- You want me to go? OK, I'll go.
- You don't have to go.
I didn't come in here... He thinks of me as a journalist, but I'm not a journalist.
The high sheriff's lady would like to talk to you.
Who's the high sheriff's lady?
Would I know?
Do I look like Robin Hood?
Who the hell is the high sheriff?
- Who's the high sheriff?
- Her name is Sarah Lee.
- Where is this high sheriff?
- I think she's a big cheese.
She's next door. She's next door.
Is this Jim Clarke?
Jim Clarke is the high sheriff of Nottingham?
Oh, deary me.
- Better get your boots on.
- She wants to say hello.
- Who is she?
- The high sheriff... The guard just told me.
The high sheriff's lady. You might get knocked out by the high sheriff's lady.
I'm the sheriff's lady and on behalf of all of them,
I've come to say how happy we are to have you here, and I hope you have a very successful night.
Everybody loves you, there's thousands outside.
And these are my three boys.
David, Stephen and Stephen.
And they think you're so marvelous that they've left all their exam papers, they've left everything to come and listen to you.
- OK. I better be good.
- You better be good.
I don't think you can help being good.
But we're thrilled to have you here.
If you come after May, again, then I'll have you as my guest in the mansion house.
- This lady will be lord mayor.
- After May.
- This lady will be lord mayor.
- I think the songs you sing are very wonderful.
- And you write them yourself sometimes?
- I write them all.
Do you really?
They've got feeling and they're marvelous.
And I really mean this, I think you're a really good example for the youth.
- Thank you.
- So if you come back again,
I shall be delighted to have you both as my guests in the mansion house.
Here's my friend.
He's got something for you too.
How do you do?
- Here's a harmonica.
- Would you like it?
I'd love it. Is this from you? Thank you very much indeed. That's very lovely of you.
You're his friend. I've just invited your friend.
If he comes any time after May, he can come with you and stay in my mansion house.
It's a beautiful place. I shall be lord mayor after May, God willing, of this lovely city.
- Yeah, we'll come back.
- And I really mean it.
And I want everyone to know what a wonderful city this is and what hospitality we give, and I also want you to know how very thrilled we are to have you.
Thank you very much. Goodbye.
It's 7:30 now? Oh, shit.
- What song is that?
- George Formby.
He's the one that did
Mrs. Brown, You've Got A Lovely Daughter.
Oh, yeah, by Herman and the Hermits.
Have you seen that on television? Dave Berry.
He does all these slow actions like the human sloth.
He does...
He's great and he has a microphone and he drops it down his back.
What do the Animals do for a piano player now'?
Well, they've got one. There's a good friend of mine going to go in later on for good.
Aren't you playing with them no more?
I haven't seen them. It just happens, you know.
It's king-size.
Oh, man. I don't feel like singing.
You will when you get out there.
Two encores or one, man?
Maybe one. You know...
Maybe. I would like to do one.
Who did I give the matches to before? OK.
There it is. I want that.
- Have you got your rum in here?
- I'm not sure what's going on.
I'm thinking about a song that has to work.
- Did you get glass in that?
- Yeah, and wood.
What?
What are you doing?
Where are you? I'm talking to you over here.
- Keep it like that.
- Oh, are you over here now'?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Where's the door?
- Down the stairs.
- Where, man?
- Come on, get up the stairs.
Sorry.
- Straight through?
- Yes.
Up these steps.
Sorry.
Get in a taxi, Pete, come on!
Pete! Pete! Get in a taxi!
Where is he? Where is he?
Oh, he's going.
- Come on, down here!
- Come on, quick!
I wanna know who threw that glass!
- Yeah, this is...
- Who did it? Tell me!
If somebody don't tell me who did it, you're all gonna get the fuck outta here!
Now, who did it? I don't care who did it, man,
I just wanna know who did it!
I'm pissed, but I wouldn't do it.
I was out there in the bathroom going out.
Careful. Hey, don't tell me you're pissed, man!
Don't tell me you're pissed,
I don't wanna hear it.
- Who threw the glass?
- I didn't throw a glass.
Well, who did?
Tell me, you were there, who threw it?
You know who?
Yeah, I'm in a bit of bother.
All right. Hey, I don't care who did it.
If you know who did it, tell them to get out there and tell the cats that come up here to ask who did it, tell them who it was.
I'm not taking no fucking responsibility for cats I don't know, man.
I got enough responsibility with my friends and my own people.
- I know. I agree.
- Now, come on.
- I was out there...
- I don't care who it was...
I don't want none of your shit, man.
I don't want glass in the street.
- I'm not giving you shit.
- What did you do it for?
- What did you throw a glass for?
- I didn't.
Well, show me who did, if he's not here by the time I count to ten, you'd better take responsibility for it.
All right, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten - you got him here?
- I wouldn't do that.
- Hey, man, I'm not kidding you.
- I'm going!
- He's gonna clean up that glass, man!
- I'll clean it up! I'll clean up your glass, man!
- I'll help you, man.
- I wouldn't clean your...
- I believe he's all right, man.
- OK? I believe...
- Listen...
Don't "come on, listen" me,
I've heard it a thousand times, man!
- Listen. I'm going.
- I know a thousand cats that look just like you.
- Talk just like you
- Oh, fuck off!
- Well, well.
- You're a big noise, you know.
I know it, man, I know I'm a big noise.
- I'm a bigger noise than you, man.
- I'm a small noise. I'm a small cat.
That's right.
- If I'd have thrown a fucking glass...
- You're anything you say you are, man.
- I'm nothing!
- You're nothing? I believe you.
- Nothing!
- I believe you, man.
- Boys...
- Bobby Dylan...
- You're a big international noise!
- Could we have a drink over here?
I'm nothing. I didn't throw any fucking glass in the street, man!
You know, if I had, and I wanted to believe it, you know, and if you'd wanted to, you know, come at me for fucking glasses,
- you know...
- Just a minute.
- I'd have had a go at you.
- All right, man. Cool it, man.
- I will go down and pick it up for you.
- No, you don't have to, just tell me.
- Be groovy, right?
- Yeah, either be groovy, or leave, man.
You don't have to be groovy for me, just be groovy for anybody.
There's a gentleman here inquiring about a glass.
Right.
Hey, a lot of people can stay, man.
Whoever did that glass...
They damaged the car.
- Oh, man.
- Now we've got trouble, you see.
Oh, OK, we'll find out who did it.
We won't find out who did it today, I'm sorry.
I used to wear a cowboy hat like Jack, right?
I got a record of yours and Jack's.
- I have one called The Cowboys.
- You're joking!
- Also...
- Rambling Boys.
Rambling Boys and The Cowboys.
I just wanted to meet you sober, man.
Not to hurt anybody.
Just didn't want the glass to hurt anybody.
- Me too.
- OK.
Listen, man, why don't we get together, and I'll turn you on to some things?
OK.
Are there any poets like Allen Ginsberg around?
No. No, nothing like that.
- Dominic Behan.
- Yeah. You know what?
I don't wanna hear nobody like Dominic Behan, man.
- Dominic Behan is a friend of mine.
- That's fine, man.
I just don't wanna hear anybody like that though.
That's OK.
He plays like Jack, man.
Yeah, man.
Yeah, that's a good song, man!
Sing, Bob.
Well done!
- Play another one.
- I wanna do It's All Over Now Baby Blue.
- Go on, Bob.
- Yeah.
I've done that thing with the strings.
D tuning.
- Great, Bob!
- That was nice, Bob.
- I used to...
- You wanna hear another song?
Is that the stage door?
Please, yes.
I don't care what they see.
This is the Savoy Hotel here. We're on our way in about ten minutes with Mr. Bob Dylan.
So can you sort of expect us?
Through the stage door - there's not many kids there? OK, right, thanks very much. Bye.
Yes, very few there, apparently, so...
Beautiful day, man.
I've been in offices all day since ten this morning.
Organizing my other tour.
- The other folk singer, Donovan?
- Yeah, the other folk singer, yeah.
- How's that tour doing?
- Not so good.
He said, "What do you think if we booked a theater in Scarborough for a Sunday concert
"and put just Donovan all on his own?"
I said, "I can't see it for two hours."
He said, "Do you think we should book one other act?"
I said, "I think we should book about four."
This must be a very old theater.
- Sure. Victoria died in 1894.
- Queen Victoria built it for her dude.
Get up there, get a touch of reality.
Look at all the boxes!
God!
Hello?
- They're here?
- All over the place.
Yeah, I'll use it, man, you know? I'll use it.
Have you finished rehearsing now, have you finished rehearsing?
- Rehearsing? We're finished with the stage.
- Right, right.
Yeah, I'll use it, it's passable, it's just a drag that there's no new one.
Are you going to see the concert tonight?
Are you going to hear it?
OK, you hear and see it, and it's gonna happen fast.
And you're not gonna get it all. And you might even hear the wrong words. You know'?
I won't be able to talk to you afterwards,
I got nothing to say about these things I write,
I mean, I just write 'em.
I'm not gonna say anything about them,
I don't write them for any reason.
There's no great message.
If you wanna tell other people that, go ahead and tell 'em.
But I'm not gonna have to answer to it.
And they're just gonna think,
"What's Time magazine telling us?"
You couldn't care less about that either.
You don't know the people that read you.
Cos, you know, I've never been in
Time magazine, and yet this hall is filled twice.
You know? I've never been in Time magazine,
I don't need Time magazine.
And I don't think I'm a folk singer.
You'll probably call me a folk singer, but the other people know better.
Cos the people that buy my records, listen to me, don't necessarily read Time magazine.
You know the audience that subscribe to Time magazine?
The audience of people that want to know what's happening in the world, week by week, the people that work during the day and can read it.
It's small, right, and it's concise, and there's pictures in it.
I mean, those kind of people, it's a certain class of people, that take the magazine seriously.
Sure, I can read it, I read it on the airplanes, but I don't take it seriously, if I wanna find out anything
I'm not gonna read Time magazine,
I'm not gonna read Newsweek or any of these magazines, they just got too much to lose by printing the truth.
- You know that.
- What kind of truths are they leaving out?
On anything! Even on a worldwide basis.
They'd just go off the stands in a day if they printed really the truth.
- What is really the truth?
- Just a plain picture.
- Of what?
- Of, you know, a plain picture, of...
I should say, you know... a tramp vomiting, man, into the sewer.
You know, and next door to the picture, you know, Mr. Rockefeller, or, you know,
Mr. C.W. Jones, you know, on the subway going to work.
You know, any kind of picture, just make some sort of collage of pictures, which they don't do.
There's no ideas in Time magazine, there's just these facts.
You know, because even the article you're doing, the way it's gonna come out, it can't be a good article.
Because the guy that's writing the article sits at a desk in New York, without leaving his office.
He's just gonna get all these 15 reporters, and they're gonna send him a quota.
- You know?
- That's not true.
He's gonna put himself out, he's gonna put all his readers on it, and another week will have some space in the magazine.
But that's all! It means nothing to anybody else.
I'm not putting that down, because people have got to eat and live.
You know?
But, if you have to do this, be honest about it.
- I mean, sure...
- I don't think...
I know more about what you do, and you don't even have to ask me how or why or anything, just by looking, you know, than you'll ever know about me. Ever.
I mean, I could tell you I'm not a folk singer, and explain to you why, but you wouldn't really understand.
- All you could do, you could nod your head.
- You could be willing to try.
No, I couldn't even be willing to try, because it would be - there's certain things which - every word has its little letter and big letter.
Your friend had the right word - pigeonhole.
No, it's not pigeonhole, it's not the word at all.
Every word has its big letter and little letter, like the word "know".
- The word K-N-O-W?
- Yes.
OK. The word "know" - capital K-N-O-W.
- Yes.
- Like each of us really knows nothing.
Right, but we all think we know things.
And we really know nothing.
You're saying you know more about what I do...
No, I was saying,
I was saying that you're gonna die and you're gonna go off the earth, you're gonna be dead, and it could be 20 years, it could be tomorrow, any time, so am I.
We're just gonna be gone, the world's gonna go on without us.
Now, you do your job in the face of that, and how seriously you take yourself, you know, you decide for yourself.
OK? I'll decide for myself.
Now, you're not going to make me feel unhappy by anything you print about me, or anything like that, you know, you couldn't offend me.
I'm sure, you know, I couldn't offend you.
So...
All I can hope for you to do, is, you know, all your ideas in your own head, somehow, wherever they are...
Do you care about what you sing?
How could I answer that, if you got the nerve to ask me?
What a nerve asking me a question like that!
- I have to ask...
- Do you ask the Beatles that?
I ask because you have the nerve to question...
I'm not questioning you,
I don't expect any answers from you.
Do you think somebody wouldn't go see somebody if they didn't want entertainment?
- Of course not.
- Who wants to go get whipped?
And if you do wanna go get whipped, aren't you gonna be entertained?
Right? OK, so do you think anybody that comes to see me is coming for any other reason except entertainment, really?
They'll tell you they come for different reasons.
- Well, who cares what they tell you?
- They think they know why they're doing it.
- Do you know why they're doing it?
- I know...
People say all kinds of things.
The answer is to weed it out - can you weed it out?
I don't know how you weed it out.
Yeah, well, you see, you're not gonna learn,
I can't teach you to weed it out.
I didn't say that I couldn't weed it out,
I said I don't know yet.
Yeah, I have no idea.
First of all, I'm not even a pop singer.
- Do you think you'll ever be that?
- I don't know. I have no idea.
Every singer is in some sense a pop singer, even if it's Caruso.
- He's appealing to a popular...
- He's a pop singer.
Yeah, I'm just as good a singer as Caruso.
Have you heard me sing?
- Have you ever heard me sing?
- I like Caruso better.
Well, you see right there we have a little disagreement.
I happen to be just as good as him.
A good singer.
You have to listen closely, but I hit all those notes.
And I can hold my breath three times as long if I want to.
Is it gonna start on time?
Is it gonna start on time?
Miss anything different?
What time does it start? Seven o'clock?
- That's it.
- Donovan not playing?
- Yeah, keep seeing him.
- Don't start till he arrives, Bob.
- Yeah.
People who like Donovan, man, they just like everybody.
We got special speakers on each...
All the seats are sold, anyway.
- Are you gonna go on set or not?
- Yes, I am.
Hey, the Beatles are here.
This should be a lousy place,
I'll have to be able to hear myself.
- You hear yourself?
- There you go.
Stay right in back here.
About two minutes.
A minute and a half.
Next time I come in, then it'll be time to go.
So be ready.
OK now? Get the harps.
The hall is dark, come on.
Let's go.
I looked in the closet, there was Donovan.
This is called
It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding Ho Ho Ho).
Blinds out, house lights and the Queen.
OK? Fair enough.
Actually, the applause, it's kinda bullshit.
Better do something else, they're just sat there waiting.
See ya!
Go, driver, go!
Go, driver!
- Ah, beautiful, beautiful, man!
- That was a good concert.
That was a good concert.
Beautiful!
They were all there, man.
All of them.
Goddamn!
- The vanishing American.
- Yeah.
God, I feel like I've been through some kind of thing, man!
You have!
I know, but I mean, there's something special about it, man.
- They've started calling you an anarchist.
- Who?
- Papers, that's the word now.
- Anarchist!
- Yeah.
- You're kidding, what paper's this in?
Two or three.
Today, yeah.
Just cos you don't offer any solutions.
- You're kidding.
- Of course.
- An anarchist?
- Yeah.
Give me the cigarette.
Give the anarchist a cigarette.
Anarchist!
A singer such as I!
Yeah, I was surprised to see it myself, but there you go.
It took 'em a while to think of that name.
- No, they couldn't say communist.
- Didn't they say that yesterday?
Communists, in England communists really aren't, you know...
- Oh, it's cool.
- Yeah.
I don't think it's cool to be an anarchist though.
- No, I'm sure it is!
- I hope it's not, I don't think it is.
Are you hurt, Sister?
It's a miracle we weren't both killed.
Couldn't you see me, Sister?
Oh, yes, I-- Of course--
Are you all right?
I had the right of way, Sister. I was coming right down the center of the road.
Right down the center, in plain sight.
You just couldn't miss me.
I almost didn't.
-Oh, thank you.
-Are you sure you're all right?
Oh, yes.
Oh, I'm all right.
I just hope the scooter's all right.
You see, we all drive it at the convent.
What a world.
The last thing I expected to see coming at me is a nun on a scooter.
What kind of nuns are they making at that convent nowadays?
Hard-headed ones, thank God.
Oh, my.
Go on, here.
I know. Who wants that? There you are.
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Oh, dear.
There's someone at the door!
-I'll go.
-1 hope it's Father Clementi with more paint.
I have to attend to everything.
I can't be two places at once.
-I'm getting it--
-Don't bother.
I was only peeling potatoes for stew.
-Nothing to do but answer doorbells.
-Well, as long as you're not busy.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought this was out of order.
Oh, no.
It worked perfectly with every pull.
I'm Sister Ann.
Oh, yes. I'm Sister Cluny.
We were expecting you earlier.
I'm a little late. I came on the scooter.
I put it under the shed outside.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That, uh--?
That is part of your effects?
Sister Adele's in here. My guitar.
-Guitar?
-Yes, Sister.
I would suggest the best place for her is in the music closet.
I'll take good care of her.
What's that funny smell?
It's either fresh paint or my stew.
Well, let's hope it's the fresh paint.
Sister Ann, welcome.
Oh, my dear child.
Welcome to Samaritan House.
Thank you, Mother.
I'm so happy to be here.
You must be tired after your trip.
And hungry too, I imagine.
I was beginning to worry about you.
You are a little late.
I know, but I was riding along pretty fast on the scooter...
...when this barge captain whistled at me.
The boat whistled.
This farmer in a cart landing on my head...
...and these cobblestone streets,
I'm still bouncing.
Well, anyway, you are here.
Did you have any difficulty in finding us?
No, but when I turned the corner,
I thought I had the wrong address.
The streets are so-- And the people.
We know.
That's why this is the ideal spot for us, don't you think?
Of course, Mother. I just hadn't pictured it as quite this ideal.
-I'm glad you brought your guitar.
-I'll put it away.
No, Sister Cluny. It's quite allowable for Sister Ann to keep it with her.
She won't be a nuisance, Sister.
-Sister Ann.
-Sister Elise.
We wondered when you'd be here.
You're usually early.
-I'm a little late--
-Sister Ann.
Sister Brigitte.
Sister Mary.
Sister Ann.
Oh, this is a fine reunion.
It's so good to see you.
-Guess how I got here?
-How?
-l was permitted to borrow the scooter.
-No.
-Not really?
-It turned out to be quite an adventure.
This is going to be the community hall when it's finished.
All this?
- It's enormous.
- We have all our meals here too.
And it'll be for dances and meetings and--
- And singing and parties.
- For all the neighborhood people.
Father Clementi promised to make us some chairs and whatever else we need here.
He's a wonderful carpenter.
Chairs?
Oh, we could put six along that wall and four over there and--
Oh, I'm sorry, I get carried away.
I'll have the curtains ready in a day or so.
When we're finished, this place won't look so empty.
Empty? Oh, I don't think it looks empty.
I think it looks wonderful.
And if we just move the piano over there--
I'll give it a push.
You see what I mean.
Would you like to see the rest of the house now?
I'd love to.
-I'm being taken on a tour of inspection.
-Good.
Start with the kitchen.
You'll be spending your time there.
I don't mind.
Well, what do you think of her,
Sister Cluny?
Talks a lot.
She has a natural enthusiasm.
It may be just what we need around here.
We need workers, Mother, not enthusiastic guitar players.
-The guitar goes where she goes.
-A personal possession?
A material remembrance of her past life?
Is this part of our liberalization too?
-Yes, and I think for the better.
-Maybe.
Why, she ever came here unaccompanied, on a scooter.
Her true and greatest protector was still with her.
Why, I hoped they'd send us a more mature sister.
Ah, but we need our young nuns,
Sister Cluny.
They come to us fresh from their tranquil convents...
...and still fired with their ambition to become missionaries.
Eager, hopeful and--
Well, yes, I must admit it, inexperienced.
They're like girls graduating from school into the world.
And their training here won't be easy.
Some of their bright dreams of becoming missionaries may fade...
...in the harsh reality of hard work.
Some of them may even fail us...
...or we may fail them.
But those that go on, Sister Cluny, they will be nuns.
I still say this brand-new one doesn't seem to have any special skills...
...except playing that guitar.
Don't be too hard on that guitar.
It belonged to her father.
And she was a very little girl during the dreadful war years when he--
Well, the guitar is really the only family she's ever known.
It's going to get noisy around here.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
Oh, Father Clementi.
I was hoping to run into you.
Mr. Messeraux asked me to tell you that barrel of flour for the sisters...
-...will be sent from the bakery tomorrow.
-Oh, thank you.
They're grateful for any help.
And the merchants in this neighborhood have been so kind.
-Oh, we're happy to be able to help, Father.
-Well, we appreciate it. Thank you again.
Yes, Mr. Muller, I'm afraid we've run out of paint for the walls.
What was the last color I gave you?
-Beige.
-Beige.
-How are you, Mrs. Muller?
-Marvelous.
No, two gallons, please.
Anything else, Father?
Well, we could use a pound of tenpenny nails.
Tenpenny nails. Mm-hm.
And I need another pot of glue for those chairs I am finishing.
Pot of glue.
There you are.
Oh, and some steel wool to hand rub a pulpit for the choir.
Oh, some steel wool.
Yes, Father.
Oh, good.
-Anything else, Father?
-No, that will do it.
How much is all that, huh?
I hate to charge the nuns for things they need.
Why, thank you.
That's more than generous.
I wish I could do something for you in return.
Father, if you ever have a free moment,
I do need shelves next to my stove.
It's a bargain. I'll have them finished, put them up for you...
...by Saturday morning, all right?
Thank you again, so much.
Forget something?
The sisters mentioned a few hooks for the closets.
I'm sorry. I'm getting so forgetful.
Next time, I'll make a list. All right?
Yes, hooks.
How many?
A dozen?
Lead us not into temptation but--
I've forgotten "deliver us from evil."
I have it.
Good.
All right.
Deliver us from evil.
Oh, I did it again.
And we are minus a cup.
Oh, well, never mind. I'll consider it mine and drink out of the saucer.
There's no need to worry.
They will understand you.
My music should give me a good ear...
...but I suppose I'm so happy to be here,
I'm just not thinking.
Can you imagine how excited I will be if someday we are sent to Africa?
You must not expect a Garden of Eden.
It is burning hot there and so poor.
Don't you want to go?
Of course I want to go, Sister.
But more than that, I want you to go.
And learn how my people sing the Mass.
But first we must learn to live here.
"Eat as those around you eat.
Share their suffering, share their poverty and your love of God."
That's what Saint Dominic said.
No use hiding the evidence.
Sister Cluny counts the china every night, instead of sheep.
Well, she does?
Sisters, Father Clementi is here.
Wait till you see the harvest he's reaped for us.
Father Clementi!
Oh, wonderful.
Nails, glue, paints, and hooks for the closets.
-Thank God.
-And wonderful.
The Mullers were so generous...
...I promised to make shelves
Mrs. Muller's been needing.
Here, I'll take it out of your way.
Excuse me.
It goes to my workroom.
Well, Sister.
I haven't seen you before, have I?
Let me guess. Ah!
I have it. You are our latest and very welcome addition.
Sister-- No, Sister Mary, don't tell me.
-Sister Ann, am I right?
-Yes, Father.
And I am Father Clementi of this parish.
Here, let me get rid of this.
Now I can welcome you properly.
I assure you, you are most welcome,
Sister Ann.
I'm most fortunate to be here, Father.
She brought a guitar.
Oh, wonderful!
For our recreation hour, we always have a little music here.
Up to now, just the best we could do with a piano, but a guitar?
That will add spice to our familiar "Brother John."
-Will you get your guitar and join us, Sister?
-Of course, Father.
Now we have an orchestra.
-1 always do the piano, Father.
-Of course. Of course.
-And beautifully.
-Thank you.
Ah. Just in time for our evening concert, Mother.
I never miss it.
Don't tell me you've never noticed my fine alto, Father.
Have you an E, Sister Cluny?
No, you have to get along with an A.
Are you ready?
There's a smile on your face
Brother John
Brother John
There's a smile upon your face
Brother John
Brother John
When there's a smile upon your face
Then the world's a happy place
When you wear a gloomy frown
The world comes tumbling down
Won't you smile for us all, Brother John?
-Brother John
-Brother John
-Brother John
-Brother John
When there's a smile upon your face
The world's a happy place
Won't you smile for us all, Brother John?
-Brother John
-Brother John
-Brother John
-Brother John
When there's a smile upon your face
The world's a happy place
Won't you smile for us all, Brother--2?
Well, what happened?
Why did we all stop?
You sing very well, Sister!
I say my prayers with my guitar, Father.
Well, compared to you,
I'm a croaking frog.
Do you mind singing a little prayer without the frog?
You tell them about "Sister Adele."
Oh, yes, please.
Sit down, Sister.
Thank you, Father.
I will sing of Adelita
I will sing of Sister Adele
‘Twas never a servant so faithful
She wants but to serve the Lord well
Adele is my dear companion
Together we've traveled so far
Together we sing as we worship
Adele is my Spanish guitar
Though you're only a wooden guitar
And so humbly the music you play
If there's love in your heart
Wherever you are
The Lord will not turn you away
And so together
We'll sing his praise
And the music the Lord shall hear
We'll tell his glory in a thousand ways
And we'll plead for his love so dear
That was marvelous.
Mother Prioress, is this liberalization?
Make a joyful noise unto the Lord.
Come before his presence with singing.
Come on, kick it!
Kick it! Get it!
Come on, kick it!
Come on, kick!
-Come on.
-Come on, let's go.
Come on.
You kicked me.
My foot missed the ball.
No, your aim was perfect and you hurt my shin.
Why don't you wear stockings?
I do.
You can't play soccer in long skirts.
Why do you wear long skirts?
The same reason you wear stockings, to keep my legs warm.
Oh, no, no, no, you don't. Mm-mm.
I want to talk to you.
Now.
You don't look like a young man who would kick anybody.
Why did you?
I wanna get back to the game.
Oh, oh, you don't.
-What's your name?
-Dominic. Dominic Arlien.
Oh, I'm surprised you won't answer me...
...because you're named after a very great man, Saint Dominic.
-Would he have answered you?
-He would.
And he never would have kicked me.
You two gonna play or not?
- I'm wounded.
- Come on.
Mothers are here.
Time to go, boys and girls.
Mothers are here.
Hey.
Well, time to go.
Mothers are here.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Bye-bye.
Dominic?
Your mother did not come for you?
I-- I haven't got a mother.
I haven't either.
-You haven't?
-No.
Well...
...maybe you don't need a mother anymore.
-Do you need one, Dominic?
-Uh-uh.
I'm a good fighter. I don't need anybody.
Somebody may need you though.
-Who?
-A lot of people.
They don't like me. They're afraid of me.
Maybe you don't give them a chance.
First, you have to start by liking them.
And then their liking you will come as easy as anything.
Who cares? I could lick you.
What muscles!
With all that power, you could be a real leader.
Once a boy named Dominic
To whom I sing this song
Kicked someone in the shins
And knew that he had done wrong
Now if this boy named Dominic
Ever tries another whack
He's going to be sorry
When that someone kicks him back
But he wasn't really a bad boy
And he grew up big and strong
And he fought for all the good things
Instead of the things that were wrong
If this boy was really sorry
This could end up a true story
-You made that up.
-That's right.
I made it up for you.
Dommie?
Dominic!
-That's my sister. I gotta go now.
-Run along, Dominic.
-l kicked you on purpose.
-1 know.
-Hurry up, Dom!
-Oh, Nicole!
Tuck your shirt in.
Are you ready to go?
I'm Sister Ann, Nicole.
We're very happy having Dominic here.
I wonder if you heard we're going to have young people's dances every Saturday?
Why, no, I didn't.
We hope you'll come and bring an escort.
I can't. I work Saturdays.
What a shame.
What sort of work do you do, Nicole?
I'm a maid. These people entertain a lot.
We have to go now, Dominic.
Say goodbye.
Bye, Sister.
Can we finish the game tomorrow?
Of course. See you tomorrow, Dominic.
Goodbye, Nicole.
It's too bad you didn't come earlier, Father.
We could've used a good goalie.
Oh, I went to see a fellow I know who works for Primavera Records in Ghent.
Records we could play at our dances,
Father, if we had a juke box?
This time, it was the other way around,
Sister. I wasn't taking, I was giving...
...giving them a chance to make a recording of you.
-Of me?
-Yes.
Why, they probably expect and I--
What did you tell them?
Not them.
I just talked to my friend for a while.
Well, give or take an hour or so.
And he more or less gave in.
How do you feel about it?
Well, I don't know.
I only sing hymns, my own thoughts.
-Besides, Mother Prioress wouldn't allow it.
-She did.
Truly now, Sister,
I've given this a great deal of thought.
Oh, the record will only be sent to convents, you see?
So that sisters all over the world can find joy in your songs.
But I'm so busy here...
...and the time it takes to ride back and forth to Ghent--
Oh, all right.
-When?
-Tomorrow.
Oh, no.
-It'll be just another minute, Father.
-Thank you.
It won't be long now, Sisters.
But when she took her drums,
I hoped I never saw her again.
-Hello there.
-Hello.
Would you like a cigarette?
No, thank you.
What's the name of your act?
Our act?
Oh, what's the name of yours?
We're the Mexican Marauders.
Oh, we're the Dominican Desperadoes.
-Cute.
-Sisters.
Thank you.
I will see you later.
Mr. Gerarde will see us now.
Sorry to have kept you and the sisters waiting.
I might've known a high-pressure character like you would be ahead of time.
No apology needed, Robert.
We are deeply grateful for your kindness.
Think nothing of it.
I've arranged to put you in Studio B.
Right this way.
-Where are you taking the jukebox, boys?
-To the storeroom.
Is it out of order?
No, we just don't need it anymore.
Studio B is to the left.
Give me an idea of how many records you'll need for the convent.
-As a guess, a thousand.
-A thousand.
And upwards.
Here we are.
-Not very large, I'm afraid.
-Oh, it's large enough.
Imagine, Mr. Gerarde, if we had had these facilities at the conservatory.
Paris Conservatory. Lucienne.
Sister Ann, Robert.
Five years ago, I lost track of you.
-How do you want this, Mr. Gerarde?
-Tape it.
We studied at the conservatory together.
She graduated, I quit.
If I saw you on the street,
I wouldn't recognize you--
I know.
You cannot tell one nun from another.
But it's easy.
This is Sister Michele, Sister Mary,
Sister Ann.
Sister Ann? Good Lord.
Exactly.
-You'd better lower that all you can.
-Yes, sir.
Emile, be sure of the balance on this.
I promised Father Clementi a perfect job.
Right.
Adele, you're looking well.
Sister Adele now, Robert.
-You got her too, did you, Father?
-She's a very devout guitar.
She never told you about the night she spent in a pawnshop...
-...to pay for my fine when I was arrested.
-She does not tattle.
And he'd only been speeding, Father.
Usually he was a very hardworking music student.
What do you do here, Robert?
Mr. Duvries and I are partners.
I suppose I'm an executive.
Sounds impressive, but what do you do?
This and that. Discover new talent, shape and groom their careers.
Make sure their affection for Primavera Records is deathless.
-And legally binding?
-Both ways, Father.
-We're all set here, Mr. Gerarde.
-Fine.
-Father, won't you be seated over there?
-Thank you.
What will you sing, Sister Ann?
-A little hymn. Sister Michele.
-Thank you.
A little hymn?
All Sister Ann's songs are like prayers.
Well, I really must be leaving. Back to--
Emile will take good care of you.
Good luck on your hymn.
Thank you, Robert.
-Sister.
-Thank you, Sister Mary.
Could I hear a few bars?
Far beyond the stars
That's fine, thank you.
Far beyond the stars
My soul is longing to go
There beyond the sun
To a better place I know
Through the darkest night
I can see the heavenly glow
-Far away
-Far away
Beyond the stars
-Far away
-Far away
Beyond the stars
Time ages of time
Yet is my time, so dear
The bells hasten to chime
Warning the hour is near
The road leads far away
And soon the days disappear
And I sing hallelujah
Unto him
Alleluia
Far beyond the stars
My soul is longing to go
There beyond the sun
To a better place I know
Through the darkest night
I can see the heavenly glow
-Far away
-Far away
Beyond the stars
-Far away
-Far away
Beyond the stars
Yeah
Love that baby, yeah
Oh, that baby
Baby, you're all mine
She's my baby, yeah
Love that baby, yeah
Oh, that baby
Gerarde, one moment, please?
Gerarde, we need Studio B and it's full of nuns.
They should be through by now, Duvries.
Let's see.
There beyond the sun
To a better place I know
Through the darkest night
I can see the heavenly glow
Far away
Far away
Beyond the stars
Far away
Far away
Beyond the stars
Not bad for a nun.
Not bad at all. Perfect, Sisters.
Is that all?
-That is all.
-Thank you.
Well, Robert? I didn't oversell her, did I?
You have a job as manager if you ever decide to take off that collar.
Sorry. It's nailed on. Heh-heh.
And you, you were absolutely--
What can I say?
I'm so happy you liked our little hymn,
Robert.
- Liked it? Emile, we'll do another.
- Right.
-Another?
-Yes.
-You have something else?
-Yes, Robert.
May I see?
Here you are.
That's not what sleeves are for.
Here.
I didn't know you had a pocket in that dress.
I have one here and another here.
This is for my prayer book and my other rosary, see?
You could hide a lot of stuff in there, couldn't you?
Certainly could.
I only got room for my bottle tops and corks.
-No room for the rosary?
-1 don't need one.
Oh, I do.
-I count the beads when I say my prayers.
-You could count in your head.
Oh, I say so many, I might get mixed up.
You're not very smart, are you, Sister?
Not very.
Come on.
Here it is.
Hello, Papa.
Who's this?
I'm Sister Ann from Samaritan House,
Mr. Arlien.
Well, he's a big boy.
He doesn't need to be walked home.
Usually Nicole is with him.
She didn't come for him today.
You can never tell about her.
Aren't you gonna let Sister in, Papa?
Well, if she wants to.
The place doesn't look like much, but with Nicole out working all hours...
...and with me not feeling up to it, what do you expect?
I understand, but that should not stop us from having a visit.
Well, I was just gonna go down to the corner.
-You mind if I stay? Nicole may possibly--
-No, no, that's quite all right.
That's quite--
You just make yourself at home.
Papa goes to the corner when he feels terrible.
Hey, look, another cork.
-You wanna see my room?
-Yes.
This is Papa's room. Now, come with me.
Nicole and I sleep here.
This is Nicole's bed and this is mine.
Oh, dear.
I tell you what we'll do. Uh....
Let's surprise Nicole and straighten things up for her. Hm?
You take the blankets and the sheets off the bed...
...and then we'll make them up.
I'll pick up her things.
What's the use?
They only get messed up again at night.
But you sleep better without the lumps.
Men don't make beds.
Soldiers do in the army.
Bed-making time.
Resting time.
You can't get by that easily. Let's go.
Nicole's gonna be home any minute.
Come on.
All right.
Dommie? You home?
Uh-huh.
Good.
Dominic, you stay here and go on working.
I'll keep her in the other room. Hm?
All right.
Papa go out?
Nicole?
What are you doing here?
I came home with Dominic.
We wanted to surprise you and straighten your room.
I found these.
You--
-You snooping-- You--
-I'm sorry.
-No, I'm glad. I'll have an opportunity--
-You showed them to Dommie?
Of course not, Nicole.
-Why did you?
-Why don't you leave me alone?
Not until we have a talk.
I cannot turn my back now that I know about these.
I want to help you.
I don't want your help.
Help from God, then.
He hasn't paid the rent so far.
And you can get this straight.
I'll keep on making these pictures.
And if I get enough money,
I'll make more and more.
What pictures?
Oh, it's all right, Mr. Arlien.
Nicole and I were just talking.
-You give me those.
-Mr. Arlien, let me handle this.
You don't expect me to support this family and buy your liquor mopping floors, do you?
Oh, stop. Keep your hands off her!
You come back here.
You come back here!
How dare you treat her like that?
You must use kindness and understanding.
-Oh, understanding?
-And love, I beg you.
Yeah, I only understand one thing.
That's my daughter.
That's my flesh and blood.
It's none of your business.
It has to be somebody's business.
I'll talk to her.
I want you out of here. I don't need you around my children. Out. Out.
Get out. Out and stay out.
It all started because
I wanted to clean up her room.
-l wanted to be helpful.
-But were you being helpful?
Or were you interfering?
Nicole was not there to accept your offer of help...
...but you decided to give it anyway.
But after I found the pictures,
I had to try to talk to her.
Yes, of course. Yes.
But even though you only suspected Nicole was at fault...
...yet you accused her in front of her father.
Now in future, try to make sure that any suspicion of sin...
...remains strictly a private matter between you and the sinner.
And I involved her father.
Well, you never know what you'll uncover in some places.
The truth is, I find it difficult to love a girl like Nicole.
I wanted to do so much when
I came here and I've made a bad start.
Don't expect to win great victories here, my child.
Or even in Africa someday.
Be thankful for small ones.
And try to keep in mind always that your motive is what is important.
To serve our Lord.
I have a lot to learn.
I'll give you a rule to go by.
If you can't be helpful, be silent.
Thank you, Mother.
And thank you, Sister Cluny.
A million dollars?
That is what I think one album of hers ought to make.
Her share would go to our order, be allotted to various missions.
Under no circumstances would we consent to anything...
...that might disturb
Sister Ann's vocation.
No, of course not.
But it could be a great blessing.
A million dollars usually is.
Good afternoon, Mr. Gerarde.
-Robert, what are you doing here?
-Waiting for Father Clementi.
He's in talking with Mother Prioress.
I'd like to talk to you.
-I'm very busy. I don't think I could take--
-May I sort of follow you around?
I would like you to see the place.
-l guess it's all right. This way, Robert.
-Here. Let me.
-Thank you.
-Lucienne-- Sister Ann.
-It's difficult for me to call you that.
-Yes.
I've been playing your record over and over. That's why I'm here.
To ask permission to sign you to a contract.
Do you think there's a market for my hymns, Robert?
Sister Mary?
-Sister Mary set up our dispensary.
-Sister.
Nothing elaborate, but a start.
-Hello.
-Hello, muddy Maurice.
Milk time.
Oh, look at that pretty face.
That boy could find a mud puddle in the middle of the Sahara.
Well...
Come on, let's have a little drink.
Oh, come on, please?
Let me live down what I said about your hymns.
Exciting, good music. You're an artist.
You should be proud of yourself.
Thank you, Robert.
But if we believe God is in all artists...
...then we should be only humble for what he has given us.
All right. But as an artist, you should be heard.
-Oh, I am heard here. Ask Sister Cluny.
-Here?
I'm talking about a--
I'm talking about an audience of millions.
People all over the world.
People who have never heard your kind of--
Would you like some milk?
-Hello. Would you like a little refreshment?
-Thank you.
-We're running out of tires, Sister.
-We'll have to go see Gaston again.
What are they doing?
Putting rubber heels on shoes.
Saving money.
Saving pennies.
When I'm trying to make you understand that just one album of yours--
Would you care for some milk?
Here you are.
- Yeah.
- We have another--
I don't know much about the protocol of talking to a nun...
...but I knew you once.
What made you give up everything for this?
It's depressing that you should be here.
But I want to be here.
You know what I mean.
What kind of girl wants to get up in the middle of the night...
...eat a Spartan breakfast, put in a back-breaking day...
...among people like these...
...and live in a tomb?
-No girl would.
-That's what you do.
Not I.
I get up in the middle of the night to go to Mass.
And then I have a Spartan breakfast.
Followed by doing the dishes, studying, visits in the neighborhood...
...playing with the children, feeding them, doing more dishes...
...and then more prayers. You see?
Much more glamorous and fascinating than you thought.
Isn't it?
How can you joke about it?
Because I'm very happy.
I even have a dispensation to laugh once in a while.
Good. I still like to laugh with you.
But I don't think you realize how much there is in this world you're missing.
Maybe you don't understand how much there is outside this world you're missing.
Maybe I don't.
Now, about the album, will you?
Robert, I told you, I'm very happy here.
I'm doing what I want to do.
My, you have become a stubborn girl.
-I've become a nun.
-So you turn me down?
Yes, Robert.
Can't you understand the joy I feel working for God?
Don't, please don't pity me.
Well, I tried. I'm sorry.
Don't be.
I have good news, Robert.
Mother Prioress has no objection to your making the album.
Providing the bishop gives his consent.
I don't see why not.
No, in view of everything,
I don't really see why not.
You know I'm inclined to be blunt,
Monsignor.
Suppose--
Suppose she has to sing before an audience.
Sister, you sing in church, don't you, in front of an entire congregation?
Well, not with a guitar.
And not because someone pays me.
Someday you will get your reward and a harp in heaven, Sister.
Do your singing, Sister Ann.
You will spread the word of God much better and much further than I ever shall.
Yes, Monsignor, if that's what the order wants me to do.
Does this settle the issue?
Thank you, Monsignor.
Thank you, Monsignor.
Sister Ann.
I can tell you now that I knew you'd reach out and take this chance.
Yes, Father.
With you I shall walk
All of my life
With you I'll always be
With you I shall spend
The rest of my life
My love in eternity
I was worried, wondering where you were at this late hour, my daughter.
And found you, safe with God.
I was troubled, Mother.
And now, are you more at peace?
I think so.
If you ever--
Remember, I am here too, my daughter.
Thank you, Mother.
Put on your pretty skirt, my soul
You rendezvous
You rendezvous
Put on your pretty skirt, my soul
The Lord we love is waiting for you
You wear a happy smile
You can't help but rejoice
For in a little while
You'll hear our Master's voice
Put on your pretty skirt, my soul
You rendezvous
You rendezvous
Put on your pretty skirt, my soul
The Lord we love is waiting for you
I'd like to be as free as the wind
That sings everywhere
I'd like to be as free as a cloud
That floats in the air
I'd like to be the flame of a fire
That lights the skies with my desire
To be with you
My Lord, with you
Raindrops, raindrops
Fall upon my window
Sparkle on the leaves
Of a thirsty apple tree
Raindrops, raindrops
Down the hill and through the meadow
No time to stop
On their journey to the sea
See the pretty raindrops
Dance upon the rooftops
Tumble down the chimneys
Then go splashing on their way
To every church and steeple
The world and all her people
There's a miracle of heaven
In every rainy day
Raindrops, raindrops
Fall upon my window
Sparkle on the leaves
Of a thirsty apple tree
Raindrops, raindrops
Down the hill and through the meadow
No time to stop
On their journey to the sea
The brook becomes a river
And the river flows forever
Till the--
- Is it all right if I rest a few minutes?
- Yes, of course.
I'll be right with you.
Andre, get some tea or something, will you?
That'll be all for tonight, gentlemen.
Thank you.
I didn't mean to fade off that way, Robert.
I just wanted to stretch a little.
No wonder, 14 songs.
I was having a wonderful time listening,
I forgot how exhausting it must be for you.
Why don't you sit down for a bit and relax?
That's a fine idea.
Five years ago, I'd have taken you out to a fine restaurant...
...for a bottle of wine and some good jazz.
Five years ago, I would have accepted.
Seems to me, I did.
I wish you could have heard yourself.
Your voice came across very clear.
No echo.
I left my echo at home.
Good thing too.
That one song, number four.
-"Alleluia.”
-Yes.
You put a little pause in there. I like that.
That's my kind of song.
The music always spoke a special language to you and me.
But you've grown.
You have a whole new dimension you never had then.
It comes from being very happy, Robert.
-You know who'd be proud of you?
-Hm?
-Professor Von Hoffritz.
-Oh.
"That guitar, Fraulein, is a musical instrument...
...not a defensive weapon.”
"Do not clutch it to your bosom like it was your first-born.
Do not point it like it was a machine gun in those American gangster films...
...and do not strangle it as if it was this beloved music professor."
Oh, you've come a long way from that music student I used to know.
-You've come a long way too, Robert.
-l suppose I have.
I wonder just how did I become a typical business executive.
What happened to your music, Robert?
It just got lost.
I needed more discipline and encouragement to work alone.
And perhaps the inspiration I once had.
It's too bad. You were very good.
I was so certain you would use your talents to brighten the world.
Did you ever finish it, Robert?
Sister Ann?
Ah, Lucienne.
What happened to the wonderful plans we made?
The good times we had together?
Where did I go to?
What did you say, Robert?
I didn't say anything.
Sister Ann, wait till you see what we bring.
Wait till you see.
We have a feast here.
- Oh, thank you, Robert. Look.
- You must be starving by now.
-Cheese, meat, salami.
-Oh, it's lovely.
-Some tea? Would you like some tea?
-Thank you very much.
Here, Sister. Help yourself.
-Oh, thank you.
-You, Robert.
Hey.
Oh, my.
That girl. Oh, my gosh.
-Does anyone here know this girl's name?
-That's Jeannette. Miss Jeannette.
That is a needle, Sister, not bayonet.
-Oh, dear.
-Now, try again.
The trouble is,
I keep thinking about the next step.
When I aim this thing at a live arm.
When you have to inoculate a hundred screaming children in Africa someday...
...you will not have time to think. Here.
Uh, thank you. I-- Oh.
-Put her there.
-What happened?
She was dancing and she just fainted.
-Her name is Jeannette.
-Thank you, Sister. We'll take care of her.
Here you are, Sister.
Thank you.
Feeling better?
Yes, thank you.
Have you had many of these fainting spells?
Some. I'm pregnant.
Well, congratulations.
I hope you have a nice, healthy baby.
I'm not going to have a nice, healthy anything.
I'm going to have an abortion.
You shouldn't even think such a dreadful thought.
-Why not?
-Having a baby is a wonderful thing.
Oh, now, just a minute--
And you're planning to have your baby deliberately killed.
-What did you say?
-1 said, you're planning to have your--
Sister, sister.
I understand how you feel.
You're not women, you're just stupid nuns.
Listen to me, Jeannette.
I was born in Africa in a mud shack.
Four children were born there before me.
Not one lived to see even six months of tomorrows.
There was no food, no sanitation.
So my mother went to the village medicine man...
...full of bitter tears. Just as you are.
And they tried, with all kinds of voodoo concoctions.
But every day of my life, since I have been old enough to understand...
...I prayed my thanks that they failed.
What do you hope to do about your baby, Jeannette?
Won't you come back?
We will do everything we can to help you.
She had no right to call me a murderess.
I hope she'll come back.
Yes, I know you do.
I wanted to help her.
But I didn't, though, did I?
It was a delicate, a very personal thing for her.
Maybe you attacked with too much fervor.
-Attacked?
-Yes.
Even if you believe there is a war between right and wrong...
...be sure you do not enjoy the battle too much.
When am I going to learn?
You will.
You will learn.
Amen.
Amen.
Are you not coming, Sister Ann?
Do you mind?
I wanna work on my music.
Won't you sing for us?
Oh, I'm sorry, Sister Mary, not tonight.
Sister Ann?
Don't you feel well?
Oh, yes, I'm just a little tired.
Well, in that case, maybe you'd better postpone working so much...
...with your music and rest.
Oh, I can't.
I have an idea for a new song.
-It isn't quite right yet.
-l see.
You have been very much in my thoughts the last few days, daughter.
I ask myself if perhaps we're not making a mistake...
...by placing too much importance on your music.
And if you might not be risking everything...
...by this misjudgment.
Oh, music has always been important to me, Mother.
I know. That's just what I'm afraid of.
When I was a young nun, to be sent somewhere as a missionary...
...was all-important to me.
And then I found the people strange...
...I didn't understand them and so I couldn't love them.
-And I thought I was a miserable failure.
-1 know.
The way I've been a failure with the people here.
But my music makes up for that.
I think I can do some good.
Why can't I love to sing and learn to love all people too?
How much love have you to give, my daughter?
People need all you have.
A little love is not enough.
Are you sure that your love for your music is not interfering with your other duties?
I hope not.
I will pray to God to help me.
Well, come with me a moment.
I have something to show you.
This is from Primavera.
They're giving a garden party at Mr. Duvries' home.
Publicity for your album.
They ask if you'll be good enough to come and bring your guitar...
...and be prepared to sing.
You don't have to accept, you know.
I'd like to.
And I'll be happy to sing for them.
Perhaps I should give them something after all they've given us.
I'm only concerned with what you give to God, my daughter.
But it's my way of doing good.
Don't you want me to go, Mother?
I think you've already made that decision yourself.
I'll write and tell them you accept.
How [ love to go
For a walk along the street
Just to smile "Hello"
To the people that I meet
And to watch the show
Of their happy. happy feet
And I say to myself it's a miracle
As I walk along
I sing a melody
It's a happy song
I'm sure you will agree
And when things go wrong
Oh, how it comforts me
Then I say to myself
It's a miracle
Allelu, alleluia
I sing as I walk along
Allelu, alleluia
God gave me such a happy, happy song
Can't you feel his love
And joy in everything
In the wonder of
The sparrow on the wing
In the stars above and the song I sing
In the joy of his love
In the stars up above
In the song that I sing
It's a miracle
"Brother John."
There's a smile on your face
Brother John
There's a smile upon your face
Brother John
When there's a smile upon your face
Then the world's a happy place
Won't you smile for us all
Brother John?
Brother John
Brother John
When there's a smile upon your face
Then the world's a happy place
Won't you smile for us all
Brother John?
When you wear a gloomy frown
Brother John
And when you wear a gloomy frown
Brother John
When you wear a gloomy frown
Then the world comes tumbling down
Won't you smile for us all
Brother John?
Brother John
Brother John
Brother John
When you wear a gloomy frown
Then the world comes tumbling down
When there's a smile upon your face
Then the world's a happy place
Won't you smile for us all, Brother John?
Brother John
Brother John
And when your heart is full of love
‘Tis a blessing from above
When you wear a gloomy frown
Then the world comes tumbling down
There's a smile upon your face
Then the world's a happy place
Won't you smile for us all
Brother John?
I have a confession to make, Sister.
I'm senile.
I was against her album.
Religious music, I said.
What made you think of combining folk music with prayers, Sister?
Perhaps I felt God might be tired of our formal, traditional hymns...
...and would enjoy a different kind of prayer once in a while.
May I have your autograph?
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't do that.
You see, I'm not a singer who happens to be a nun.
I'm a nun who happens to like to sing.
-She's quite witty too.
-Yeah.
This way, Sister.
Can you believe you're really a nun?
Yes, easily. I'm a Dominican nun.
What does that mean exactly?
There are different kinds of orders.
Sister, you haven't touched your pheasant.
Go ahead, eat.
-Where are you appearing next, Sister?
-Appearing?
Oh, we have great plans for this girl.
We'll be sending out releases.
-Robert, you take care of that.
-That's a little premature, don't you think?
-Sister, may I get you an ice?
-Yes, thank you.
She seems to be enjoying herself.
You can't blame her for being pleased with her bit of success.
It will be over soon.
I wonder how the big stars live through it.
The world at their feet? It must be a glorious feeling for a little while.
A heady feeling.
Well, she's become a top recording artist.
Robert tells me they're today's new nobility.
Strange that none of us thought of this.
-Mr. Gaston?
-Mr. Gaston.
We've used up our last tire.
-You sisters must be rough on rubber heels.
-Well--
Help yourselves.
Glad to get them out of the way.
You're very kind.
Oh, this is best.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
Now, you watch me.
Good, bravo. Look at that.
Hey, look. It's Sister.
Dom, come back here.
-Hello, Sister.
-Dominic, what are you doing out so late?
Piet invited us.
He's a rich sailor.
Why don't you let him buy you a drink?
- No, thank you.
- Come on, Dom.
- Just a minute, Nicole.
- Go back to the table, Dom.
Go on!
Why is Dominic with you in this place and in such company?
They're my friends. Where do you think he ought to be, home alone?
Home, with you.
You have a duty to your brother.
And it's late for a girl your age to be out too.
You're out pretty late yourself, Sister.
If you must go out, you can always leave him with me.
-He'll be safe, then.
-He's safe with me.
- I don't think so.
- 1 think it's time we left, Sister.
I'm taking Dominic with me.
- Oh, no, you're not. He's staying with me.
- Dominic?
I said, I think it's time we left,
Sister. There's nothing you can do here.
That's right. You tell her, Sister.
He's my brother.
What are you gonna do about it?
-Here. Go on, have a puff.
-No, thank you.
Go on, take a try.
Well, what got into you?
More letters, Mother.
-They're all for Sister Ann.
-Well, set them over there, Sister.
May I come in, Mother?
What is all this?
I believe it's called fan mail.
That is wonderful. Marvelous.
And I bring more good news.
I have with me a very important gentleman who's waiting to see you.
Mr. Ed Sullivan.
Who is he?
Millions of people in America watch him every Sunday night on television.
Well, that need not concern us here.
-Excuse me, Mother.
-But--
But the convent in Copenhagen wired to ask for 20 more albums.
Where do you want these?
There. Don't bring any more until we find room for them.
Mother, he has come over 3000 miles just to have a few words with you.
-Didn't you get the letter about his arrival?
-We haven't had time to open our mail.
-Nevertheless--
-Excuse me.
Three busloads of boys from Saint Stephen's have arrived.
They want to sing their school song for Sister Ann.
I'll see them later.
Mother, please, Mr. Sullivan--
Well, I suppose it wouldn't be very courteous not to see the gentleman...
...if he's traveled so many miles.
Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Fitzpatrick...
...I'm sure you didn't come all the way from New York to Belgium just to visit me.
So my I ask why, even though I think
I can guess the answer?
I'm quite certain, Mother, you're not familiar with our TV show in America.
Well, you're right, Mr. Sullivan.
I'm afraid I'm not familiar with it.
-It's a very clean, family-type show.
-Oh, very nice.
To get to the point, Mother...
...we'd like to present on our show your Sister Ann.
But why, Mr. Sullivan?
People can hear her on records.
But they'd like to see her.
And honestly, if you'd give us permission...
...I can assure you that we'll present her in all dignity and respect.
Well, I wish to thank you, Mr. Sullivan.
And I regret that I must answer in the negative.
Well, just one favor.
Could I meet her? Because when I go home
I would like to say that I had met her.
Well, of course, Mr. Sullivan.
Come this way, won't you?
Can I help you, Sister Cluny?
Over there, Mr. Sullivan.
Sister Ann, this is a very great pleasure.
-Oh, no. Down there, Mr. Sullivan.
-Oh.
Sister Ann, this is indeed a great pleasure.
I'm a great fan of yours.
My name is Ed Sullivan.
I come from New York.
And I'm here to ask you to sing on our television show.
New York?
-I'd like that.
-Of course I told him no.
Oh, and I regret that, Mother, because our cardinal in New York had proposed...
...perhaps we get something for your order that would be badly needed.
Oh, we could have used a jeep,
Mr. Sullivan.
Particularly when we reopen our Africa missions.
I was thinking of several jeeps, Father.
Several jeeps?
It would be a great help if a jeep could've been delivered to our mission.
-One or two? Or three?
-Sure.
One is all we will need, Mr. Sullivan.
-Thank you, Mother.
-And thank you, Mr. Sullivan.
Excuse me, miss, what's the voltage here?
I had no idea putting on a television show was anything like this, Mr. Sullivan.
May I, please?
My only theatrical experience was when I directed a Passion play in Bruges.
-This must be quite a contrast, Father.
-Oh, yes, and very exhilarating.
Max.
They look too white. They're like spooks.
Can't you put something on them?
That lady says nix. No makeup.
No makeup.
- Hi.
- I am sorry, children.
-Do you mind, Father?
-Hm?
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Okay, Mr. Sullivan?
- Okay, Fitz.
-All right, girls, if you'll take your places.
-Mr. Fitzpatrick, please. Sisters, not girls.
Oh, thank you, miss.
All right, Sisters, right this way.
There you are. If you'll get on the stool.
Fine.
May I, Sister?
Thank you.
No, it's too much white.
Do you sisters have any change of clothing?
Something dark blue, perhaps?
No? Well, I guess we're stuck with the white.
- What about the lights?
- Okay.
Ready, Mr. Sullivan.
-Yes, Fitz.
-Stand by. Quiet.
Five, four, three, two.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Tonight is a very special feature...
...of this very special show.
From Belgium, we are going to bring you the voice...
...of a very dedicated young woman who composes and sings her own songs.
So now, ladies and gentlemen, here is The Singing Nun, Sister Ann.
Dominique, nique, nique
1 will tell of Dominique
His goodness to acclaim
And I pray the song I sing
Will some simple pleasure bring
That the world shall know his name
1 will tell of Dominique
As I sing this little song
And when [I sing the chorus
All the world will sing along
Dominique, nique, nique
It was good Saint Dominique
He lived for you and me
From the labors long ago
Came a better world I know
And his love shall always be
Though I'm poor, said Dominique
As he spoke unto the Lord
I will be your humble servant
And your love is my reward
Dominique, nique, nique
1 will follow Dominique
His burdens will I share
For his courage will I pray
His teachings to obey
His words shall be my prayer
By the kindness of his heart
And the labor of his hand
He brought love and understanding
As he wandered through the land
Dominique, nique, nique
1 will tell of Dominique
His goodness to acclaim
And I pray the song I sing
Will some simple pleasure bring
All the world shall know his name
Dominique the mighty warrior
Was a soldier of the Lord
His armor was devotion
And the gospel was his sword
Dominique, nique, nique
It was good Saint Dominique
He lived for you and me
From his labors long ago
Came a better world I know
And his love shall always be
Through the blazing heat of summer
And the chill of winter snow
1 will follow Dominique
In his footsteps I will go
Dominique, nique, nique
1 will follow Dominique
His burdens will I share
For his courage will I pray
His teachings to obey
His words shall be my prayer
-Oh, Sister Ann.
-It was really beautiful.
It was beautiful.
Well, we must be sure to thank Mr. Gerarde for making it possible for us to see this.
It was really very kind of him, wasn't it?
But now it is over and we must get back to our work...
...which has suffered a bit.
Not that a little luxury isn't good for the human spirit once in a while...
...but in small doses.
Too many luxuries can become as everyday and as expected...
...as, well, Sister Cluny's nightly stew.
So, daughters, let us be thankful that tonight...
...Samaritan House will be once more in repose.
She's forgotten we promised to be at Primavera to sign those papers.
May the Lord keep thy soul
May the Lord keep thy coming in
And thy going out
From henceforth now and forever
I want to talk to Sister Ann.
Well, she's not here just now.
May I help you?
It's got to be her.
I'm sorry, but she's in Bruges.
Some business about her recordings.
-We expect her back later tonight.
-That won't help.
Well, Sister Ann isn't the only nun here.
I'm quite willing to help if I knew what you wanted.
I only wanted her because Dom likes her.
My father's been dragged off.
Dom's all alone.
Hell, forget it!
Wait.
-Wait.
-"You can always leave him with me."
That's what she said.
"I want to help you. I'll pray for you."
All that bunk.
Where is she when you need her?
-But she isn't the only nun here. I'll take--
-1 didn't come for anyone else.
You're a stranger to Dom.
She tells him stories. What could you do?
-Well, I can tell him stories. I can--
-I'm gonna take him with me.
I don't need her. I don't need any of you.
Dominic?
-There doesn't seem to be anyone--
-Someone's in there.
Dominic? It's Sister Ann.
Dominic?
Open the door, dear.
I'm so glad.
Dominic, have you been here all alone?
Oh, your hands are like ice.
Nicole said you couldn't come.
Well, I came as soon as I could.
Oh, my. Now--
-Oh, God bless you.
-God bless you too.
Feeling better?
-Where's your father, Dominic?
-In jail.
And Nicole, where did she go?
To work. We didn't have any money.
Well, you were very brave to stay all by yourself.
I know. Is there any more?
Well, let's see what we can find.
Well, that won't do.
Oh, there's nothing in here but two big brown B-U-G-S.
Dead, thank goodness.
Oh, we have a lot of them here.
That settles it. He can't stay here.
How'd you like to spend the night at Samaritan House?
-We'll put a cot in the big room downstairs.
-All right.
I'll get his things ready.
His pajamas and whatever else he needs.
I sleep naked.
I did too when I was your age.
Very well, then. He'll need a sweater.
I'll leave a note for Nicole so she won't worry about you.
It's all right.
What are you gonna say?
"Dom will stay with us...
...until you call for him.
I promise to take good care of him,
Nicole...
...so do not worry.
He is safe with me. Sister Ann."
-Good.
-Good.
Down.
Up.
-Down.
-That's my place.
Down, up, down.
All together now.
Oh, how I wish I were a Pied Piper
I'd play a happy song
Sing, Michel.
When I dance down the street
The children would follow
And sing as we go along
Very good.
Everybody come.
Who wants to be the Pied Piper?
-All right, Dom. You be the Pied Piper.
-I'm the Pied Piper. Everyone follow me.
And when the grownups
Heard the little children
Sing the Pied Piper's song
Then maybe they'd learn
To love one another
And sing as we go along
Oh, Mrs. Bouchet, please, the gate must remain closed at all times.
Oh, I'm sorry, Sister. Run along, Rene.
Come, Rene, you're late. Come on.
Who's first?
Slide down. I'll catch you.
There she is, Robert.
Come on, Dominic, that's a boy.
I want to try it too.
Whee. Oops. Oh.
Thank you, dear.
Whoo!
-Robert!
-You're surprised to see me.
I came to tell the famous Singing Nun...
...that Primavera wants to send her on a world tour.
-You must be joking.
-No.
-Can we talk somewhere without the music?
-Oh, yes.
Children, play by yourselves for a while.
-Dom, you're still the Pied Piper.
-Right.
-So, Pied Piper, pipe.
-Right.
Rats and mice, follow Dominic.
Think of it, Lucienne.
Paris, London, New York,
California, Japan.
All those wonderful places.
And doing what you like to do best, singing.
With Sister Adele, singing all around the wide, wide world.
But, of course, I cannot go.
-Why can't you go?
-Because my life is here.
I admit you had this wonderful dedication.
You tried it and I respect that.
But things have changed.
You have a chance for a life in the world.
Is the good you do for a handful worth more than what you'd do for millions as a singer?
-l can't listen.
-Let me finish.
Take a close look at what you do as a nun.
Taking care of other women's children?
My God, what a waste.
You should be having children of your own.
The children.
Dom.
I didn't see him until the last minute.
He ran right in front of me.
- No, no, don't move him, Sister Ann.
- I didn't mean to.
-Call an ambulance. Quickly.
-Yes, Father.
With you, I shall walk--
With you--
Father?
Any word?
Then we keep praying, huh?
I've been trying to pray, Father.
But I cannot.
It was an accident.
You mustn't blame yourself.
Can't pray?
No. I've tried.
Father, I need your help.
God deserved better from me, but I've given him nothing.
What have I given anyone?
Your songs, your music. Don't you think you've won a great victory through them?
What kind of victory, Father, if I've lost myself winning it?
I am a priest.
That means, I suppose, that I should be able to give you some answers.
You see, I pray with this in my hand.
Oh, it means a great deal to me.
How much does your music mean to you?
It was a friend, a gift from God.
I sang to him with my guitar.
But I used it for my own glory.
My own importance.
I liked being made a fuss over, Father,
I like being The Singing Nun...
...who could make millions.
And I cheapened his gift and he's taken it from me.
He's taken nothing from you.
He's not a vengeful God, Sister.
-Then why can I not pray now?
-You can pray.
If there is anything I know in this life, everyone can pray.
You are praying right now.
No, I'm not.
I'm not and I have not been.
Oh, Father, can't you see?
I've been living half in one world...
...and half in another and I'm lost.
Lost between them.
I've been aware of that.
Do you want to leave the convent?
No.
You answer so quickly. Think.
And don't expect anyone else to make that decision for you.
That decision was made long ago.
Father, when you see Robert, would you give him a message for me?
Of course.
Will you--?
Will you tell him I hope...
...his life will be fulfilled?
And what about your life?
Make certain, Sister Ann, search your heart.
Thank you, Father.
What have I done to you?
What have I done to you?
Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women.
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, mother of God...
...pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of--
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, God.
Thank you.
Sister, guess what.
I can leave my cast on for another whole week.
-You must have a very nice doctor.
-Yes.
I came to say goodbye, Mr. Arlien.
Yes, I guess you heard we were leaving this town.
We're going to my grandma's.
She has a farm and a pig and everything.
Oh, pigs are lovely.
Yes.
We'll be all right now, Sister. I--
I think there's enough man left in me to give him what he needs...
...and to get from him what I need.
I'm glad for you and Dom and Nicole.
I don't think the fresh air and the fresh life appeal to her.
I wanted to say goodbye to you alone.
I wanted to tell you how sorry I am about what happened to Dom.
You won't have to worry about him anymore.
You won't have to worry about any of us.
We'll be out in the country with the pigs.
You'll like it there.
-Is that what you came to tell me?
-Yes.
Well, you've told me. Goodbye.
I haven't been much of a friend to you,
Nicole.
You always thought I interfered.
Perhaps I did.
But I care what happens to you...
...and wherever you go or I may go,
I will always care what happens to you.
Why?
Why should you care? No one else does.
Because we're so much alike.
You see, I've been bewildered and confused and frightened too.
Then you know I've been blaming you for everything.
I should have been taking care of him...
...but I left him alone because I wanted to go out.
I was sick of him. I was sick of this place.
I was sick of everything.
I wanted to have some fun.
Oh, God, Sister, fun!
That's all over, Nicole.
Things will be different for you now.
Better, happier.
Do you really believe that?
Yes, I do. Completely.
Well, they're waiting for me.
Nicole, before you go...
...I want to give you this.
Your guitar, Sister?
I don't know how to play.
It doesn't matter.
I wanted to give you something.
It's all I have. Please take it.
And when you feel all alone, it may speak to you as it did to me...
...and remind you that God is with you, always.
-Let me have that bag, Sister.
-Oh, thank you.
Goodbye, Sister.
Goodbye, Dom.
I want my name to be Dominic now.
Then goodbye, Dominic.
Goodbye, Mr. Arlien.
Goodbye, Sister.
Robert, you didn't have to come in the back door.
-Next time, try coming in the front, huh?
-I'll do that.
-Do you mind?
-No.
How's the recording business?
That record you persuaded me to make,
Father.
It opened up a whole new world to me.
If I'd have known it would end like this,
I'd have turned you down.
If I'd have seen my own part in it, there would have been no deal.
I've decided I am a priest, not a promoter.
I can't even find her.
She's left my life as abruptly as she reentered it.
I've been to the Samaritan House.
They told me she was not there.
That's all they would say.
Do you know where she is?
I know she's happy.
Isn't that the greatest thing a man can wish for someone he loves?
Oh, I know, it is more gratifying to think that he brings the happiness.
But for some, joy is a bird soaring upwards.
It cannot be earthbound.
Will you accept this, Robert?
If only I could be certain the choice were her own.
It was.
Please realize and respect the fact that she closed the doors between you, herself.
Thank you, Father.
Spoon next to the knife.
Spoon next to the knife.
Spoon next to the knife.
Sisters?
A letter from Sister Ann.
-Sister Ann?
-Yes, Sister Ann.
A very quick worker, great help to me in the kitchen.
Sets a beautiful table.
Spoon next to the knife.
- Sisters.
- Well, shall I read it now?
Yes, please.
Thank you.
"Dear Mother, dear Sisters:
The schoolbooks you sent arrived and were most welcome."
Oh, good. And we were so worried.
"And while I still have some difficulty with the dialect...
...l try to teach in the language of sympathy...
...which is understood by all.
We travel many miles every day to visit remote villages.
We start very early in the morning...
...because Africa is a country where everybody...
...and everything starts early.
We travel long hours through a beautiful country...
...along dirt roads, carrying a heavy load of supplies.
And we pray for Mr. Ed Sullivan every day for giving us our most prized possession...
...the intrepid Dominique.
Every day in this wonderful land holds its own surprises.
And we're learning to accept them gracefully.
I feel we're beginning to establish a wonderful rapport everywhere we go.
And I can assure you that we're making many fast friends.
We've set up small clinics.
And the villagers give us such a warm welcome...
...that we no longer feel like strangers."

Miss Fanny?
- Miss Fanny?
- Down here, Emma. Third row.
I came in early to tidy up, and the doorman said you were in.
What you doing out there?
The one place in the theatre
I've never sat.
Maybe things look different from here.
This is the day, isn't it?
Yeah.
Any word yet?
No. The wire just said tonight.
You nervous?
Nervous, happy, scared, excited...
I'm going to make a fresh pot of coffee. You coming?
I think I'll just sit here for a while, okay?
Well, I'll be in the dressing room if you want me.
Mr. Ziegfeld wants to see you.
When you feel like it, he says.
He'll be waiting in his office.
Thanks, Em.
Did you hear that, Mrs. Strakosh?
Ziegfeld is waiting for me.
For me.
See, you were wrong, Mrs. Strakosh.
No, Fanny, darling, I'm not wrong.
For a girl, for average, you're a pleasure.
But when people pay good money in the theatre...
...especially the male element, they want something extra to look at.
But if a girl isn't...
If a girl isn't what?
Don't worry, Mrs Strakosh, they'll look at me.
The whole world will look at me and be stunned.
It was all right when you were a child and made funny faces.
- Then, you were cute.
- My condolences, darling, you're no longer cute.
Hey, wait a minute.
No, it's all right. I'm one of the 8 Beautiful Girls 8.
Well, the makeup helps a lot.
Really.
Sell it, sell it.
Get in there, Fanny.
Knees high. High! Way up there.
Go.
Hold it, Eddie.
Hold it!
You, with the skinny legs.
You. Yes, you, with the bloomers!
Yeah?
- You're fired.
- What?
You call that a replacement?
What's the matter, Ed? Did you owe somebody a favour?
- It seemed like a funny idea.
- What's funny about it?
- What do I say?
- Everybody back at 4.
But listen, you're making a mistake.
I got a lot of experience, honest.
I've been on the stage since I was 10.
Amateur contests,
Gottlieb's Southern Repertory...
...professional companies. Lassie...
I doubled six parts.
I played a daughter and her father.
A 60-year-old Indian chief.
Listen, girlie...
- Hau.
Please, you've got to face facts.
You don't look like the other girls.
- I know, but...
- You got skinny legs, you stick out.
And you are out!
I'm just trying to tell you something...
- Sorry, kid.
- Why don't you give me a chance?
Look! I do a terrific time step! Watch!
Out! Out!
Look Mr. Keeney. Suppose all you ever had for breakfast was onion rolls.
Now, all of a sudden, one morning in walks a bagel.
So, I mean, you take a look at it and say,
"What is that?"...
...until you tried it.
That's my trouble.
What's your trouble?
I'm a bagel on a plate full of onion rolls!
Nobody recognizes me. Listen:
No autographs, please.
Hau? What did she say?
You think beautiful girls are gonna stay stars forever?
I should say not. Any minute now thye're gonna be out.
You're no chorus girl.
You're a singer.
And a comic.
With skinny legs.
So why did you try out for the chorus?
'Cause that's what you were looking for.
If you'd been looking for a juggler, I would have been a juggler.
I just gotta get on a stage somehow.
How come you hired me?
Because you wanted it so much.
Are you sure you're tough enough for business?
Maybe not.
- Say, can you roller skate?
- Why, you had a sudden urge to go skating?
No, I'm trying out a novelty number tomorrow.
If you can skate, be here at noon.
Yeah, but what about Keeney?
- He won't be in till night. By then the number'll be in the show.
But he'll kill you. He might even fire you.
Not if you're good.
Are you sure you can roller skate?
Can I roller skate?
- I thought you said you could skate.
- I didn't know I couldn't.
Nora.  Sandra.
Cherry.  Wilma.
Ruthie. Polly.
Fanny.
Go. Get out there.
Thanks, mister, I really...
Hey, you!
- Lady, back inside.
- What are you doing?
Fanny, they liked you. Go back out there, Fan. Go ahead, honey.
- You, stay back.
- It's my show!
No, you don't.
Her. On her. Over there!
Smile.
Eddie, they liked it!
Did you hear that...?
- Mr. Keeney...
- Get the next act on.
What do you think I'm paying you for?
So they shouldn't like it?
I didn't know you were paying me.
I don't know what you pay me, but I bet it isn't enough.
Listen girlie, when I get around to thinking about you, I'll let you know.
Well, if it isn't Miss Roller Skates.
- Listen, I'm really sorry, girls.
- Oh, sure you are.
We heard the applause.
I'm sorry I loused up the number, but I couldn't help it.
As long as I did, I'm glad it was a hit.
Who do you think will see you in this dump?
Florenz Ziegfeld?
Why not? You think the word can't spread?
I'll spread it myself.
I know a lady who knows the lady who makes his shirts.
He's gonna hear about me.
Go ahead and laugh.
I'm telling you something.
One night, you'll be sitting around here laughing and kidding, just like that...
...and there's gonna be a knock on the door.
You see? And there he'll be: Ziegfeld!
Sorry to disappoint you, but the name's Arnstein.
- Did you want to see someone?
- Yes.
You.
Gorgeous.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, I mean, your shirt.
It's absolutely the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen in my life.
What's it made out of?
French handkerchief linen.
It goes very limp, though.
Yeah. I can see.
Except, it's really beautiful.
All the tailcoats I've seen,
I mean...
...well, they were rented, you know...
...they all got these stiff shirts.
Well, this one's just for fun.
You've probably heard this so often that it's boring...
...but I had to come back to tell you how much I enjoyed what you did.
It's not so boring. You'd be surprised how boring it isn't.
You're going to be a big star some day, Miss...
Brice. Fanny Brice.
Fanny Brice.
I'll look for it in lights.
- What did you say your name was?
- Nick Arnstein.
- Come around thinking about me, Mr. Keeney?
- It's you. Hello, Arnstein.
I'll give you $25 a week.
Take it or leave it.
- I'll take it.
- Leave it.
I'm offering 35.
What do you mean you're offering? Since when are you...?
In show business? I'm not.
But one of your competitors authorized me to deal for him...
...whenever I ran across a talent I considered really unique.
So...
...$35 a week?
Well, I wasn't authorized to go over 50.
She's yours for $50 a week.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
$50 a week?
$50 a week? I'm almost a millionaire!
- Hey, who's the competitor?
- There's no competitor.
What do you mean, you were bluffing?
Like in a poker game?
- What if Keeney had stopped first?
- You'd have lost.
- I would've lost a job.
- I was willing to take a chance.
With my job?
Hey, Nicky.
- Come on. We're waiting. Hurry up.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Wow. Are those yours?
I'm just minding them for a friend.
Look, we're going to Delmonico's for supper.
Won't you join us?
We'd be happy to wait while you change.
I'd have to change too much. Nobody could wait that long.
I'd have a much better time and a lot more laughs.
Well...
...thanks anyway...
...but I'm meeting some people in my mother's saloon.
Honest.
You want a few jokes to take with you?
I'll wait till the next time we meet, which will be soon, I hope.
Hey!
Whoever washes your shirt, tell them to put a little starch in the last rinse.
That way, it won't go so limp.
Oh.
A little starch...
...in the last rinse.
Thank you. I won't forget.
It's a telegram! There's a telegram for Mrs. Brice!
A telegram for the Brices!
The Western Union man.
That's life for you. Somebody's dead.
Come on, telegram!
- What do you think of my new song?
- I like the old one better.
Yeah, but I'm tired of it.
I've been singing it for six months.
- So?
- So?
What?
What's that?
- Oh, look, here's Fanny now.
- Let her mama tell her.
Rosie.
Who is it, Mama?
Auntie Blanche or Lou?
Ziegfeld.
He died?
"Dear Miss Brice. Stop.
Please meet me at the New Amsterdam Theatre...
...on Thursday at 11:00 a.m. Stop.
Florence Ziegfeld."
See? By heart, like the Pledge of Allegiance.
Mazel tov, Fanny, darling. Mazel tov.
- I knew you'd do it.
- My stomach aches.
I wonder how a mother could call a boy Florence.
It's "Florenzzzzz."
I wonder how a mother could call a boy Florenzzzzz.
You think it's a job or an audition?
A job.
You know what I think?
Somebody talked to him about me.
See, I met this guy backstage one night with a ruffled shirt on.
Just the kind you figure to know Ziegfeld.
I bet you he said a word.
That's what must have happened.
Oh, my head aches.
Nothing aches. You're built like a horse.
I have nothing to wear.
What's she been walking around in all this time? Towels?
It's coming too easy.
That's what's got me scared.
Where's all the suffering you're supposed to do  before you click?
And the hard knocks, the setbacks you're supposed to learn from?
This is too quick.
I haven't suffered enough yet.
You haven't goy the job yet either.
Who says if you get it in a week you can't lose it?
Cheer up. Maybe you'll suffer later.
I guarantee you if you're as bossy with Ziegfeld as you are with...
I am not bossy with you or anyone.
And even if I was...
...Ziegfeld isn't just anyone.
And believe me... ...whatever Mr Ziegfeld tells me to do, that's what I'm gonna do.
Bravo, Miss Brice! Perfectly charming, and I'm delighted.
John, will you get the bride music for Miss Brice, please?
- Yes, sir.
- You mean I'm hired?
Uh-Huh.
- I'm a Ziegfeld Girl?
- That's exactly what you are.
I'm a Ziegfeld Girl.
Miss Brice, you will do "Second Hand Rose" in the first act...
...and you will sing this new number in the finale.
Alright?
Anything you say, Mr Ziegfeld.
And just go along with Tony, and he'll teach it to you.
OK.
John, I want to see the second act opening right from the top.
I'll watch it from the balcony.
Turn on the rails.
Bill, will you turn on the rails for Mr. Ziegfeld, please?
We'll do the second act opening, kids.
This way, miss.
Hey!
Paul. Paul?
Mr. Ziegfeld? Mr. Ziegfeld?
Yoo-hoo, Mr. Ziegfeld?
Mr. Ziegfeld?
Georgia, you're late.
Sorry, Flo.
- Where is he?
- He's up above. Like God.
Mr. Ziegfeld?
Mr. Ziegfeld? Mr. Ziegfeld?
Yes, Miss Brice?
I don't want to be in the finale.
What was that you said?
Well, I just...
I can't sing words like: "I am the beautiful reflection of my love's affection." I mean...
Why not?
Well, it's embarrassing.
Listen, why don't I just do my first act number ...and we'll call it a night, okay?
- No, it's not okay.
- Why not?
Miss Brice, may I remind you that you're in my theatre?
So nobody argues with the landlord?
Just wait right there. I'm coming down.
Take five. Take five, everybody.
Just take...
...five.
Is that bad, he's coming down?
Only if you want to stay in the show.
Look, what's your name?
Fanny Brice.
Georgia James.
Hi.
Tell him you were wrong.
But I'm not.
In that case, it was nice to have met you.
Miss Brice?
Now what is all this?
Not two minutes ago you said: "Anything you say, Mr. Ziegfeld." Remember?
Yes, and I'm very sorry.
But if I come out opening night...
...telling the audience how beautiful I am,
I'll be back at Keeney's before the curtain comes down.
I assure you that won't happen.
But I need a strong voice in the finale.
But please take me out of it, Mr Ziegfeld.
Miss Brice, if I take you out of the finale l'll also take you out of the Follies.... It's just that simple.
Okay, you win.
Thank you.
You don't win fair, but you win.
John, forget the second act opening.
I want to see the bride number right from the top with Miss Brice.
She can walk through it.
Right, sir.
All right kids, this'll be the bride number.
Mr. Ziegfeld?
Mr. Ziegfeld!
Now what?
Listen, can I hum it?
You will sing the words exactly as written.
And that, Miss Brice, is the end of this discussion.
Yes, Mr. Ziegfeld.
Whatever you say, Mr. Ziegfeld.
I'm sorry.
The winter bride is typified... by Christmas, frost and fairies...
And though the weather's changeable...
Her virtue never varies.
The springtime bride is stary-eyed
And poets often say...
No other bride would dare to dream the dreams that April...
May.
The summer bride is glorified by Merlin's magic touch...
A lucky man receives the love of...
June
July
And such.
The autumn bride is prude and wise at sweet sixteen or twenty...
And as a wife in future life...
She'll hold the horn of plenty.
And now a singing bride who vocally encompasses the happiness and harmony that marriage truly promises.
My friend the showstopper.
- Listen, you could have told me about it.
- I didn't know about it...
...until a minute before when I was in my dressing room, and I saw...
I had to do something.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.
It went beautifully.
You were all very good...
...and I am proud of you.
Congratulations, Flo.
Thank you.
Wonderful, Flo.
That finale topped everything.
Mr. Ziegfeld, l...
Be quiet.
The bride number was wonderful, Mr Ziegfeld.
Yes, that was fun, wasn't it?
All right, Miss Brice.
I'm waiting.
Mr Ziegfeld, I don't blame you for being mad.
But I didn't do it out of spite, honest.
I didn't plan it.
I was just sitting here and... uhhh
"Oh, look. What do you know?"
I couldn't do it straight as if I thought I was like one of those other girls.
They would have laughed.
And they did.
Yes, but it was my joke. You see?
They laughed with me, not at me.
Because I wanted them to laugh.
But, I mean...
You know what I mean.
No, explain it to me.
Miss Brice can't see anyone.
Oh, not even her mama?
Mama...
Darling, everybody's talking.
You were wonderful.
You know, we're so proud of you, we're ready to bust.
Proud, yes. But surprised, no.
Mr. Ziegfeld, this is my mother.
Oh, the big boss.
Oh, Mr Ziegfeld.
You have a hit on your hands.
Especially with my daughter Fanny.
This is Mrs. Strakosh, our neighbour.
And this is Eddie Ryan. He's my friend.
Oh, Mr Ziegfeld. How do you do?
Mr. Ziegfeld, you're a genius.
To put a beautiful wedding gown on a girl that's in the family way.
Who would think of such a thing?
Only one person I know.
We'd better go. Mrs. Brice is expecting half the neighbourhood.
Half? All.
Free beer. You come, huh?
Beer?
Mama, I'll come home soon as soon as I can.
Take your time. I'm gonna be so busy showing off.
How many mothers on Henry Street are the mother of a Ziegfeld star?
Bye.
I'll see you later.
Well, you have a charming mother, and I have a problem.
I ought to fire you. But I love talent.
And it's hard to quarrel with five curtain calls.
Six.
There you are. That's my problem.
So I guess I'll have to give you another chance.
Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld!
Did he fire you?
Not yet.
But I'll ring the curtain down on you...
...if you ever disobey an order of mine again.
I won't. I won't. Never, ever.
I'll do it straight tomorrow night.
I mean...
...without the pillow.
You'll do it exactly as you did tonight and that's an order.
- You mean you liked it?
No! But the audience did. That's why I'm going to give you another number.
I'll choose a new song for you.
Thank you, Mr. Ziegfeld!
The only thing is, about that song.
A song, you know, it's a very, very intimate thing.
I mean, it's really between me and the audience.
So?
So uhhh... one of the things I really feel definite about is choosing my own.
Choosing your own what?
Songs. Songs.
Good evening. And congratulations. Both of you.
Hello, Nick.
It's you, my first ruffled shirt.
Good to see you. How're they running?
Ahead, Flo, just like you and this little girl.
First time I saw her, I had a hunch you two belonged together.
I have the same hunch. And it's aging me...
...fast.
I knew it. I was sure it was you who told him about me.
- I'm afraid not. I wish I had.
- I don't believe you.
Have it your own way.
And you had it your own way on that stage tonight, didn't you?
Six curtain calls.
Only five.
But you stopped the show.
I did! I stopped the Ziegfeld Follies!
I knew you would. I wrote the card with your flowers before the curtain went up.
What?
The yellow roses.
I didn't even have a chance to look!
Oh, they're beautiful.
"Dear Star, I told you so."
Don't forget, I saw you work out.
Where would you like to go?
Luchow's? Delmonico's? A party? Two parties?
I can't. I gotta meet a gang of people...
" At my mother's saloon ".
Not again. Can't you skip it?
No, it wouldn't be nice and...
It's sort of a party for me.
You want to come?
I'd love to.
- You mean it?
- Of course.
You'd better think it over. I mean, it's a neighbourhood thing.
It might waste the whole evening for you.
I'll be with you, won't I?
Go ahead, get dressed.
Candidly, Mrs. Brice, that's a good-looking fellow.
Gorgeous. He reminds me of
Fanny's papa, my ex, also gorgeous.
Wherever he is, he should only stay there, huh?
What do you do anyway?
I mean, between my opening nights?
Live.
Everybody does that.
Hardly anyone does. But I do. And on the side, I gamble.
You just gamble?
Yes. Like you did tonight.
You married?
No, Mrs. Strakosh, I'm not married.
So you're Mrs. Strakosh's married daughter, Sadie.
To a dentist.
Mr. Arnstein, could I interest you in a friendly little game of poker?
Three-cent limit.
I was hoping you'd ask me.
Oh, good.
Deuces, 10s and jokers wild.
What?
We're out for blood.
Would you care to deal?
All right.
Oh, look!
That's marvellous.
I think he's played a game of poker before, that Mr. Arnstein.
The way he looks to home.
He's a gentleman.
A gentleman fits in any place.
A sponge fits in any place.
To me, when a person's a stranger, they should act a little strange.
Oh, Mom...
I bet.
I call.
I call.
I'm afraid you're too good for me.
I see. I got two pair.
It's yours.
Oh, I win, I win, I win!
How much do I owe?
I think 27 cents.
Fine bunch of crooks I introduced you to.
We had a little more practice, that's all.
Oh, Fanny, darling, I'm so happy for your success.
Only one thing could make me happier.
What?
To dance at your wedding.
Come on, children, sit down.
Talk a little.
Should I murder her now or wait till the party's over?
Now.
No, I like her.
Besides, I've been waiting all evening for a chance to be alone with you.
Where does that go?
It's the alley.
Come.
Alone at last.
Fanny, congratulations!
- Thanks, Mrs. Nadler.
I had to get up on account of the baby.
He's a regular midnight fisherman!
He'll outgrow it.
Alone at last.
That's Henry Street. You're never alone.
Everybody worries about everybody.
But it's my home and  I love having people care about me.
But I don't see how anyone could help caring about you.
Why, because I'm funny?
Well, that's part of it.
It's a funny thing. I've imagined you practically all over the world:
Paris, London, the Delaware Water Gap.
Everyplace. Everyplace except Henry Street. And here you are.
You've imagined me?
Well, I mean, I thought about you a lot.
Maybe it was your ruffled shirt.
Anyway, you're like a character in a book to me.
And I hadn't read many books, see?
So that makes you kind of...
- I talk a lot, don't I?
- Yes.
But it's one of the things I like best about you.
Boy, have you got good manners.
- It's your turn. Say something.
- All right.
With all these people who care about you by the blockfull and theatrefull...
...doesn't it ever narrow down to just one special person?
You mean, like a boyfriend?
I haven't had time.
But don't get me wrong. I mean, I know a million guys.
- After all, I am in the theatre.
- Oh, yes.
Well, see, I've been very busy and...
How about you?
Hundreds of girls, huh?
Oh, thousands!
All gorgeous.
All gorgeous.
Well, tonight should be a nice change for you.
It is.
Thousands. Wow!
Well. that way, I don't get too involved.
I like to feel free.
You can get lonesome being that free.
You can get lonesome being that busy.
Now, who would think to look at us that we got the same problem?
Fanny, you're an enchanting girl.
I wish I could get to know you better.
So give me six good reasons why not?
Just one.
I have to catch a train for Kentucky early in the morning.
What's in Kentucky?
A half interest in a little farm. I breed horses.
What's the matter, they can't do it alone?
Hey, you all packed?
So, what are you doing around here?
It's late. It's practically morning. I'll walk you to the car.
I' should go in and say good night.
No, it's all right. I'll say it for you.
You know, if you weren't in a show...
...I think I'd have asked you to come with me.
Too bad, isn't it?
I don't know. What with the Follies and an indecent proposal...
...it's been quite a night.
It was indecent, wasn't it?
Very.
Thank God. At least I can tell Mrs. Strakosh things are looking up.
- May I call you when I come back?
- Sure. When's that?
I don't know exactly. I may go right on to Europe or the Coast...
You see, I never have definite plans.
They make me feel too tied down.
But I'll call you.
Goodbye.
Watch your step.
- You the Ziegfeld Girls? - You can't tell?
All right, dear, line up over here.
Conductor, baby. What time is it, and where are we?
It's 7 a.m., miss, and we're in Baltimore.
Baltimore?
Okay, girls, that's it. Smile pretty. Hold it.
Good. All right, girls. Hold it, hold it.
Now, where's that new star...
...Fanny Brice?
Enter the star.
Miss Brice?
Hold it. Perfect. This'll just take a minute, Miss Brice.
How about a smile, Miss Brice?
So shoot the picture.
Now.
Oh, very good.
- Great. - Yes, wasn't it? I loved it.
Fanny!
How wonderful to see you.
And how wonderful you look.
You look good too. The first time I've seen you in broad daylight.
You haven't changed. And I'm glad.
Do you know how long it's been?
Just a year.
And two weeks.
What are you doing here?
I'm waiting for the train from New York.
My train?
That's right.
Fanny, will you have dinner with me tonight?
Tell me all about Mrs. Strakosh, and about you.
When a fellow gets up at 7 a.m. To meet a girl's train...
I came here to meet another girl, named Elsie.
That's good, because I have plans, so you can have dinner with her.
It'll be very dull.
There she is now.
Thanks, Jack. I'll see you at the stables.
- That's my girl Elsie. - Skinny legs, just like mine.
How about dinner? Will you, Fanny?
You always ask me out, don't you?
Whenever you happen to run into me.
- I've never known anyone so polite.
Fanny, l...
But I still have other plans. And I really must go.
Thanks anyway.
Fanny, I can't give up this easily.
I want to see you too much. We've such a lot to catch up on.
Where are you staying? Majestic?
There's a nice little private dining room downstairs.
I'll reserve it for 8:00. I'm going to hope you'll change your mind.
I'll be waiting.
No law against waiting.
People do it all the time.
"No law against waiting," I said.
"People do it all the time."
You should have heard me. I was a regular Theda Bara.
For once in my life, I didn't say too much, I didn't say too little.
I said just enough, then I walked.
You like these flowers in my hair?
Why should I have dinner with him? I'm not hungry.
You like these earrings?
Even if I was hungry, I don't need him to buy my dinner.
Then why are you going?
- I said, why...? - Who said I was going?
Won't you please come in?
May I take your wrap?
That colour looks wonderful with your eyes.
Just my right eye. I hate what it does to the left.
You planning to make advances?
I wasn't planning it, but it does seem possible.
Before dinner or after dinner?
You look beautiful.
You don't have to make leading lady dialogue for me. I'm a comic.
On-stage.
That's where I live, on-stage.
Then you're missing too much.
You said we had a lot to catch up on.
So let's start. I'm here touring with the Follies.
A week here, then a week in Chicago.
Then we rehearse a new show after that. What about you?
My girl Elsie's running in the Baltimore Handicap next Friday.
After that, I'm not sure because...
You never had definite plans.
I remember.
Somebody laid an egg on your table.
What is it?
A blue marble egg.
I got it in Rome ages ago.
It's one of my favourite things, so I thought you might like to have it.
A blue marble egg, and yellow roses...
You went to a lot of trouble even though you weren't sure I'd show up.
I hoped you would.
Just as I hope you like very dry sherry.
I wouldn't know dry from wet.
What are you so angry about?
Who's angry?
Who's angry?
I'm sorry if I'm disappointing you in some way, but what did you expect?
You didn't answer my question.
Why are you so angry?
I am not angry! Why don't you answer a question?
Do you think I should be flattered because this time your train isn't leaving in the morning?
This time you have a few days to kill.
Well I'm not a kid in Sweeney's. You're not slumming anymore.
I never was and you know it.
Don't holler at me!
I'm not hollering. You are.
That's different.
I'm a natural hollerer. Anyway, I answered your silly question.
Look, why don't we cut through all this and get to the point, which is:
Why didn't I call you when I got back from Kentucky?
You got busy.
You forgot.
There could be a hundred reasons.
Just one.
I wanted to stay away from you.
We were heading to something you couldn't possibly have known how to handle.
What makes you think I do now?
If you don't...
...it's time you learned.
Maybe we should order now?
Yes.
Are you sure you want to stay?
Well...
...might as well have dinner.
Very sensible.
Come in.
Paul, I think we're about ready now.
Madame.
Caviar, to begin with?
No, I don't think so.
Pâté Strasbourg?
Good.
Then we'll have filet de boeuf, sauce bordelaise.
Saignant?
Saignant.
Pommes Soufflées, salade d'indives...
Avec du vinaigre et un peu de moutard dedans?
Very good, Paul. Thank you.
Et comme dessert?
Fraises des bois?
Very good. Thank you.
All right?
I would have ordered roast beef and potatoes.
I did.
What's the matter?
If I can't tell when you're ordering roast beef and potatoes...
...how will I know when you're making advances?
You'll know. I'll be much more direct.
I'm calling you. What have you got?
Ace of diamonds...
...jack of spades, nine of hearts...
...four of clubs and two of diamonds.
Take it. I thought you were bluffing.
What do you hear from Fanny?
This morning she telephoned, long-distance.
Oh, yeah? How did she sound?
Two shows in a row, three months on the road.
How do you think she sounded? She sounded tired.
She didn't sound tired.
Excuse me, I made a mistake.
She sounded silly, she kept laughing.
Maybe something strike her comical.
A mother says, "How are you?" That's so comical?
She breaks out laughing.
Another thing about Fanny. On the road, she lives like a mouse.
All day in the hotel, all night in the theatre, never a drop of fresh air.
But suddenly in Baltimore, MD, she's running...
...up streets, down streets, museums, racetracks, graveyards yet.
- Do you think it could be a fellow?
Think? I know.
Who? Who is it?
The ruffled shirt!
The ruffled shirt.
Lady, if you're game for this one, he's on the house.
Nobody in history ever had three.
Start boiling the water.
I'm proud to think that I'm the man who introduced you to your first lobster....
Among other things.
Behave yourself!
I get so mad when I think of what I missed before I met you.
I played Baltimore before but never realized it was the most beautiful city in the whole world.
It makes me wish you'd come with us tomorrow.
See what you can do for Chicago.
I was going to, I decided yesterday.
Now I can't.
Yesterday you could now you can't,
What happened between yesterday and now?
You were there. Elsie lost the Baltimore Handicap.
I lost Elsie and my shirt.
But I was watching you. You didn't blink an eye.
You didn't lose your ruffled shirt.
No, darling. I never lose that.
Nor my gambling money. Just about everything else.
So...
...I have to take a train for New York at midnight...
...and the Berengaria for Europe tomorrow night.
Stop boiling the water. I just lost my appetite.
What's in Europe?
It's what's on the boat to Europe.
A lot of bored men who have nothing to do for eight days but play cards.
You are going to Europe so you can play cards on the boat?
Fanny, that's how I live. I told you that on Henry Street and the first night we were here.
Yes, I know....
I know it by heart.
And...
...you don't have to worry. You're not involved.
But I am involved...
...with a girl who has her own work, is too busy to get lonesome.
So we wave to each other from boats and trains.
I better get to the theatre.
Yes, sir.
Fanny, please don't look sad.
You walk back into my life, change everything and walk right out again.
How should I look? Happy?
But I'll be back in your life again, darling. Very soon.
Like last time.
Not a bit like last time.
So, what's different?
I love you.
Do you mean that?
You're not just trying to be polite?
You do mean it.
What do you know?
It's been the most beautiful week in my whole life.
Fanny, I should hurry if I'm to drop you, get packed and catch that train for New York.
Pick me up at the theatre at 11...
...and I'll go to the station with you.
Oh, why not? Are you afraid I'll cry?
No. I'm afraid I will.
So where have you been since 6:00 this morning?
Walking.
Just walking.
If you're gonna die whenever you say goodbye to a man...
Calling Miss Brice, Miss Fanny Brice.
Right here.
Miss Brice?
Yeah?
You feel better now?
Yeah. Yeah.
Better.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
- Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Ten dollars?
Thank you!
From Fanny? The last of the five-cent tippers?
Yeah, I should have made it 20.
Emma. Emma. Where's Emma?
What is it, Fanny?
I am not going to die. That's all.
And I'm not going to Chicago, either.
Are you out of your mund? What are you gonna tell Ziegfeld?
I don't know. I'd better find out.
Would you please get him on the phone for me, Georgia.
Where's Emma? Have you seen Emma?
Where is she? Em?
Miss Fanny?
Be an angel and help me. Hold these.
I'm only gonna take that bag and that one. I'm not going to Chicago.
What do you mean, you're not going to Chicago?
Where are you going?
Empire Limited departing for New York at 8:30 a.m.
... now boarding at track 14.
Fanny... I told him.
Please talk to her, Miss Georgia.
You can't talk to Fanny about anything.
Once Fanny makes up her mind, she makes up her mind.
But somebody has to talk to her.
- Who is it? - Ziegfeld.
You don't need me in Chicago. You still have four other good names...
...besides the tour is over in two weeks anyway.
You've said a lot of idiotic things.
No, Flo.
That's the most unprofessional thing I've ever heard in my entire life!
Hello?
Flo, will you simmer down before your ulcer starts flaring up.
That's funny coming from you. You gave me that ulcer.
Now, listen, Flo, I love the theatre.
I love to hear an audience applaud, but you can't take an audience home with you!
I want a personal life too and I'm gonna have it.
Why don't you just wish me luck?
She can't stop in the middle... What did he say?
He hung up.
Let me have that phone.
Ladies of the ensemble, adieu.
- Where are you going? - New York.
- Why?
Because I'm going to Europe with Nick Arnstein.
What?
Fanny, you've got to be kidding!
I told you, when I meet a guy I want, I won't make jokes.
Fanny, did Nick ask you to go with him?
No, but...
...when he sees me, he'll be glad.
I hope.
One ticket on the Empire Limited departing for New York at 8:30 a.m. now boarding at track 14.
Fanny what's the matter with you? Haven't you any pride?
I love the guy he loves me, I want to be with him. It's that simple.
Fanny, you're making a fool of yourself.
Georgia, when something's right for me I do it and this is right for me.
Have you asked yourself if it's right for Nick?
I'll make it right for him!
Don't stick your neck out this way!
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Don't. You mustn't do it.
Would you like all of these out, sir?
- Oh, no. Just these two, please. - Thank you, sir.
Fanny.
Darling!
If you hadn't looked exactly the way you did...
...this could have been embarrassing.
You crazy girl.
What are you doing here?
I figured that if I waited for you to make your fortune...
...how would you know that I wasn't after you for your money?
I promise I'll never tie you down. I promise.
Will that be all, sir?
Yes, steward. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
I say, I caught your show the last time I was in port.
You were simply marvelous.
- Oh, thank you. - Thank you.
Ring if you need me, Mr. Brice.
Thank you.
Courvoisier, Mr. Arnstein?
Yes, perfect. And a...
...crème de menthe frappé. - Yes, sir.
All right?
Oui, oui, mon chérie.
I like that beard on that captain. Makes him look so trustworthy.
He wants me to bring you to his cabin tomorrow for cocktails.
You're a great success, Fanny, and that's off-stage.
I'm with you, that's all.
I don't know how I ever thought of going without you.
Me neither.
- Nick... - Yes?
Go on, say it.
You went to good schools. I went to practically no schools.
You're Park Avenue, I'm Lower East Side.
Now, now. Don't be a snob..
No, no. What I am trying to say is...
And you don't have to... I mean, I'm all yours anyway, but...
Well, where I come from on Henry Street...
...when two people sort of love each other...
Oh, never mind, never mind.
Well, what do they do when they sort of love each other?
One of them says, "Why don't we get married?"
Is that so?
And sometimes it's even the man.
Really?
Forget the whole thing. Just forget I mentioned it. Wipe it out.
All right.
Thank you.
You know...
...it's pretty much the same where I come from.
Well, why don't you stop making jokes and say it so that I can say...
...I have to think it over, or ask my mother, or turn you down.
I've got a better idea.
What's that?
Have your drink.
Have my drink.
Look, why don't we get married?
When? Here? Tonight? When?
The captain looks like a rabbi.
How? When? tonight? Right now?
When I make a bankroll.
No, I don't care about that.
I do.
I intend to be the head of this family.
You will. You're smarter.
It'll be the way I say or not at all.
Could you win what you need in that poker game tonight?
It's possible.
Well what are you doing here? Go ahead, go play cards.
Wait.
I want to be a Sadie.
A what?
You met Mrs. Strakosh's married daughter, Sadie.
That's a married lady.
I see.
Can I come and watch with you?
Look, my whole future depends on it. Please!
Can you watch with no expression at all?
Whatever happens?
Can I watch with no expression?
I pass.
I'll call.
- I'll call. - I pass.
Call.
I'll call.
Cards?
Just one, please. Thank you.
Three here.
Three.
- Two. - Two.
The dealer takes three.
Up to the opener.
Opener checks.
I'll bet a thousand.
I'm out.
All right.
One thousand and...
...two thousand more.
I'm out.
Well, I think you are bluffing, Mr. Arnstein.
So I'll see you.
Well, I've got three kings here.
I thought you were bluffing.
In this distinguished and expert company?
I wouldn't dare.
I'm afraid this is getting rather dull for you, darling.
Excuse me. I'll be right back.
Good night.
Good night.
Quit, quit, quit!
It's against my religion to break a winning streak.
Goodbye, Sadie.
Sorry, gentlemen.
Your deal.
What happened?
It's a beautiful night.
I had a stroll around the deck. Did me a lot of good.
Nick!
It's terribly late, Sadie.
You should have been in bed ages ago.
How could I go to bed?
I've been sitting here waiting, hour after hour.
Did you say "Sadie"?
Honey, if this is a hotel, I don't think they're ready for us.
Oh, Nick. Oh, Nick.
It must have cost a fortune.
I made a fortune on the Epsom Derby, didn't I?
I expect to make another with this Florida deal.
So there's nothing to worry about, is there?
So who's worried? Anyway, it's the perfect house for a millionaire.
Nice baby. Open your eyes, look at your daddy.
Baby.
I bought her something. Sort of an add-a-pearl necklace.
An add-a-tooth necklace would be...
Nick, you are absolutely crazy.
She won't be able to wear this until she's grown up.
But she'll know she has it. It'll give her confidence.
Besides, if you play your cards right...
...she might loan it to you until then.
You bet she will. Won't you?
- Fifteen. One more. - Oh, please!
Sixteen.
Look at me. I'm breathing like a whale.
The way that baby slowed me down, I ought to sue her.
She's pretty, isn't she, Eddy?
Frances? She's the cutest little thing I ever saw.
Alive, alert...
But she's pretty.
Yes, Fan, she's pretty. Very pretty. Come on.
Ziegfeld made no mistake hiring you.
Heard from Nick lately?
Yeah, he calls me every night.
From Oklahoma?
Sure. With the phone bills we're getting, he better strike oil.
Come on, let's try this.
Let's go.
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three, four.
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three, four.
Nick!
Nick!
I can't believe it.
There you are.
Thank you very much.
Is that ghastly sound coming from my daughter?
What is it, honey? What is it, sweetheart? Are you wet?
Welcome home, Mr. Arnstein.
It's good to see you.
What happened? What happened to the baby?
Look who's here, honey.
Frances, that isn't very attractive, dear.
I wish you'd stop.
Thank you, sweetheart.
You've stayed blond, you clever girl.
I hate to say it, Miss Fanny, but we're going to be late for rehearsal.
Just a few more minutes.
Em, would you take the baby up to Hilda for me?
Sure.
Goodbye, my love.
Say bye-bye.
You know what?
This time I think you lost your ruffled shirt.
We struck sand and rock and water.
I think we even struck champagne.
The one thing we didn't strike was oil.
You'll think of something bigger and better while lying in a hammock at your beautiful country house.
It is beautiful, isn't it?
Nick, it's been absolutely murder dragging myself back and forth to that theatre every day....
You guessed it.
We better start looking for an apartment in town...
...on 5th Avenue. - Even on 6th. I wouldn't be insulted.
You know what bothers me more than losing the house?
It's the fact that I seem to have lost my poker face.
Just to me, honey. Come on.
Nick.
Tom.
The place looks wonderful.
As you say, a church can look cute, but a gambling house has to look honest.
And be honest.
Come on in here.
Joe, a Scotch and water for Mr. Arnstein.
When did you get back?
A couple of weeks ago.
It's good to see you, Tom.
Well, what took you so long to drop in if it's so good to see me?
We've been moving into a new apartment in town.
I've been helping with the legwork.
My wife has a show opening tonight.
Say, Nick, I'm sorry to hear about those oil wells.
Is it all over town, Tom?
Even made the papers.
But that doesn't mean anything.
It's funny, though.
I once dropped 20,000 on Monday, picked up 30 on Tuesday all in absolute privacy....
The news travels much faster these days.
That big spotlight on your wife lights you up too.
Any action in the backroom?
Now? Yeah, there's a game, but...
Nick.
Just by way of limbering up. Besides, I've got an hour to kill.
I hear they haven't been running too well.
It'll change.
He's not in his seat. I looked down during the number. He's not in his seat.
So maybe the guy's late, ran into an old friend or his watch stopped.
You're getting yourself excited over nothing.
Nothing? People get run over, don't they!
I mean, they have accidents, don't they?
Emma, go call the hospitals. Every one of them.
He could be lying in a street someplace.
Where's my eyeliner? Have you seen my eyeliner?
Hurry up and get dressed, will you?
I'll call 300.
500. Bettor.
No, not for me.
Have a bite, gentlemen. Keep your strength up. Food and liquor right over there.
Nick, it's after 9:00.
Why don't you get out?
No, Tom. Thank you. I'll watch it.
Telephone for you, Mr. Arnstein, in the bar.
It's your wife's maid at the theatre.
Look, tell her I've been detained.
I'll be there in time for the second act. Thank you.
What are you going to do? Shoot the swans?
These lovelies?
My swan girls? What are you, dumb?
Prince!
Was that necessary?
You couldn't walk over here like a person?
Where was I? Oh... I was here.
I'm sorry, darling.
How did it go?
Good reviews?
Wow!
"All any show needs is Fanny Brice."
"New York audiences continue their love affair with Fanny."
Darling, I'm so happy for you.
How was the party?
How was the party?
There was no party.
The guests didn't think the hostess was in the mood for a party.
Not without the host.
Look, let's not fight about this.
Why not?
Isn't just spoiling my opening night worth fighting about?
How do you think I felt out there trying to be funny?
I'm trying to make them laugh.
My own husband not caring enough to be there!
You didn't let your audience suffer because of me.
You're damn right I didn't!
How do you think I felt afterwards in my dressing room, with people asking me where you were?
How could I say to them that a lousy poker game was more important than my opening night?
To hell with your opening night!
Why shouldn't the poker game be just as important to me as your opening night?
It's my work, and I haven't had a smash hit for a long time.
But tonight I was winning.
I wouldn't have left that game for anything...
...because I thought maybe, finally, at last my luck had changed.
Only it hadn't.
So it'll change tomorrow.
The way it has a hundred other times.
Everyone has a run of bad luck now and then. It doesn't mean anything.
How would you know, darling?
You never lose.
That was my crazy husband on the phone.
A guy with a deal for me offered Nick a thousand to put in a word.
He took the money......
...and gave it to a waiter he never saw before in his life.
And he just put in a word.
You want to play? Get a deck.
Fanny, I never butted in your life, did I?
Sure, when I was a kid, you made me wear long underwear to school.
Some day when your children grow up and you want to talk serious...
...I hope they make jokes.
I'm sorry, mom.
I thought you were gonna start in on Nick.
Where would I come to criticize Nick? It's you I'm surprised at.
Why?
Because when you look at him, you only see what you want to see.
I see him as he is. I love him as he is.
Fanny, love him a little less.
Help him a little more.
Mama, he doesn't need any help. He's not a child.
The man is drowning. He owes money everywhere.
He doesn't know which way to turn.
What?
How do you know that?
Everybody knows. Only you don't know.
Fanny, are you so wrapped up in the show you can't see anything else?
Why wouldn't he tell me? He knows he can have anything I've got.
That's not what he needs.
Darling, you are his wife.
You've gotta sit down with him, talk to him...
...think together what he should do.
Some of that for me, Nick?
Won't make a dent in what I owe you, Peterson. But if you can't wait...
I could wait. I could even forget it.
In return for what?
I need a front man, someone like you...
...who can talk, for a bond deal I'm putting together.
It's a big one, Nick. You could make yourself a mint.
Thanks, but I don't think so.
I guess when you have Fanny Brice for a meal ticket...
...you don't get very hungry. Nick!
I'm sorry, Peterson.
Meal tickets... ...that's my joke.
Sure.
Is Mr. Branca here yet?
Not yet, Mr. Arnstein.
I expect him any minute.
This yelled through the window from FAO Schwarz:
"Take me home to Frances," it said. So I did.
Will you give it to her for me, please?
Yes, Mr. Arnstein.
Thank you.
Oh, Hilda. You and the cook have been very patient...
...but it's high time I paid your salaries.
I owe you for two months, I believe.
Miss Brice paid us, sir. All that was owed and three months in advance.
I mean, Mrs. Arnstein paid us.
Miss Brice paid you.
I'll get it, thank you.
There you are.
Am I late?
No, I just beat you in. Let's go in here.
I'll mix us a drink. You can tell me what you have in mind.
Hey, nice place, Nick.
It's comfortable and very convenient.
Water or soda, Tom?
Straight. Look, Nick, I haven't got much time.
The place is getting crowded earlier and earlier these days.
When you do that well, it's called good trouble.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
Nick, I didn't know you were home.
Hello, darling.
Mr. Branca, I haven't seen you for ages.
I've been dying to see your show, Mrs Arnstein, but I've been so busy.
I just dropped by to make Nick a little proposition.
If it's some new way of marking cards, Nick, don't listen.
Aside from that, I'll leave you. Although I'm dying of curiosity.
Come back, silly. Get yourself a drink and sit down.
- All right with you, Tom?
Of course. It's all in the family.
Sit down and start propositioning.
All right.
Well, as I told you, the place... No, thanks.
The place is doing awfully well.
So well in fact that a couple of money men approached me about opening another one on the East Side.
You know, it's getting very fashionable.
I'd like to, Nick. I think it would go.
But I can't possibly run two places single-handed.
And those people don't know the first thing about this business.
So I told them about you.
The long and short of it is, we want you as a partner.
With an extra cut for running the place. How's it strike you?
Pleasantly. I'm flattered, naturally.
And it's no secret there's no place I'd rather be than a gambling club....
Except the theatre on opening night.
Anyway it does sound like something you'd be awfully good at.
I've always had a little yen to run a club. And lots of ideas for it.
Well, then, great. Then it's a deal.
Wait, wait a minute.
It would have to depend on how much
I'd have to put up for the partnership, because...
Nick, we don't need your money. We need you.
Well how much are you and the others putting in?
Fifty thousand.
And for me it's free?
Tom, I can't let you put up my share.
I'm not. I swear I'm not.
Look, our thinking is that with your know-how and your...
...well, class is the only word I can use...
...you'll draw all the right people. We'll make our money back in no time.
A full partnership for nothing? Oh, except my "class."
Plus a cut for running the place.
That's a very generous offer.
Too generous.
Fanny...
How much were you going to put in?
Fifty thousand.
Tom, I'm sorry your time's been wasted.
Nick, it is a good idea.
Was a good idea.
Please don't blame Tom. I talked him into it.
Thanks for everything.
Nick, I was just trying to help.
I don't want that kind of help!
I don't want anyone going around behind my back...
...sinking money into me to make me look good.
Fanny, l...
I just wish you hadn't done it.
You'd better go. You'll be late for the theatre.
I can't go. Not like this.
Darling, listen. Please.
Once I saw how unhappy you are...
...I knew I had to do something.
I guess I did it wrong. You know how dumb I can be.
You don't have to tell me that everything you did you did it out of love.
Believe me, I know that.
Murray Hill 4119.
Peterson?
Arnstein.
Something wrong?
It's Nick.
He's hurt?
No, no. He's in trouble.
He's gotten himself mixed up in a phony bond deal.
So...
...what do I do? I call a lawyer or...?
He's got a lawyer.
Branca got him Bill Fallon.
And Fallon's the best criminal attorney in New York City.
Criminal?
Fanny, embezzlement is a criminal charge.
Now Fallon advised him to give himself up, and he did. A few hours ago.
He gave himself up?
You mean he's in jail?
Uh-huh.
I've got to see him.
You can't, honey. They won't let you.
I just gotta.
Look...
Miss Fanny, is there something I can do?
Fanny, Fanny look.
He doesn't want to see you.
It's understandable, dear. The man's humiliated, ashamed...
Ashamed of what? This is Nick Arnstein, not some hood!
If these bonds were phony, you don't think he knew it, do you?
That's the line Fallon is going to use, that he was a victim, an innocent dupe.
- Fallon is going to call you in a little while at home.
I'd better go.
There are a whole bunch of reporters out there backstage...
Come on to my office and go out through the front of the house.
Why? There's nothing to hide.
You want me to go with you, Fan?
No.
Will you answer some questions, Miss Brice?
Sure, but I don't talk very good yet.
Hold it that pose.
! Did you know Nick was gonna give himself up?
That man will do anything to keep him from coming home for dinner.
Peterson says Nick masterminded the whole swindle, what do you say?
He couldn't mastermind an electrical light bulb out of a socket!
What about these stocks?
Stock? The only stock I know about is summer stock.
What's your husband's story?
There is no story.
My dope was an innocent dupe! Or, my dupe was an innocent dope?
Did he try to sell you any of the bonds?
That much of a dope he ain't.
You realise he might go to prison for this?
At least I'll know where he is nights.
You still love him, Miss Brice?
The name is Arnstein.
Mrs. Arnstein.
Mrs. Arnstein, do you still love him?
Next case.
"The People vs. Arnstein. The grand jury has returned an indictment charging the defendant...
...with embezzlement, according to statute 119, Section A of the penal code."
The defendent has heard the charge. How does he plead?
Your Honour, I move for a postponement of the arraignment.
Why, Mr. Fallon?
My client's been in custody only 24 hours. I've seen him only once.
I've been unable to acquaint him fully with the charges.
Therefore I submit he's unable to enter a plea without full understanding...
Your honour...
Nick, please.
Sorry, Bill.
Your honour, there's no need for a postponement. I understand the charge.
I knew exactly what I was doing.
Nick.
So I wish to plead guilty.
I'll see the deputy D.A. And Mr. Fallon in my chambers.
I'm sorry.
You have only a few minutes.
Thank you.
What happened in there?
The minimum sentence, two years.
With luck, I'll be out in 18 months.
With luck.
Why, Nick?
You had a chance.
All you had to do was say that Peterson tricked you.
I couldn't say that.
Why not?
Because he didn't.
I want you to divorce me.
What are you saying?
We're just no good for each other, that's all. Everybody knows that.
Look, my darling, I may not be good for you...
...but nobody has the right to say what's good for me.
Not even you.
Look, you think I don't know that everything that went wrong was my fault?
I know that.
It's no use, Fanny.
Look, I've tried to tell myself I'll catch up with you.
It'll be all right.
But there's no way I can catch up with you.
I don't want to run anymore. Not in a race I can't win.
Let me go, Fanny. Let me be myself again.
I can't.
I can't just let you go off to prison and say that's that.
Why not? Wouldn't the publicity be good?
I'll be with you in a minute.
I'm sorry, darling. That's what I've turned into.
Nick, you think you mean this, and maybe you do.
But maybe it's just because of all that's happened.
So why don't we just leave it for now...
...and if you still feel the same way when you come home...
...I won't fight you.
Okay?
Okay.
Listen, you take care of yourself.
Go out, see people, do things, enjoy yourself.
I don't worry about you.
The moment you're out there on that stage, nothing bothers you.
Nothing.
The strongest woman in the whole world, that's what you are.
Did you know that?
Yeah, sure.
Everybody knows that.
So long, funny girl.
It cleaned up fine.
You been sitting in that theatre all this time?
Uh-huh
You all right?
Uh-huh
Then would you see Mr. Ziegfeld? He's waiting outside.
Yeah.
Flo, come on in.
I'll get your props for you.
Any word from Nick?
No, not yet.
I've been worried about you, Fanny.
I'm sorry you've been worried.
Flo, I don't even know if Nick wants us to go on...
...but if he does...
...I don't want to make the same mistakes.
So if it means giving up the theatre, I hope you'll be a sport about it.
Well, I won't be.
But I won't worry about it until it happens.
- Fifteen minutes, Miss Brice. - Thank you.
I'll let you get dressed.
Be happy, dear
Hello, Fanny.
You must be that fella I met at Keeney's one night.
You must be that girl from Henry Street.
I feel like a kid on a blind date.
Did you see the baby, darling?
No. I came straight here.
She's gorgeous.
Getting to look just like you.
Who says I'm not lucky?
Fanny, l...
I've had 18 months to think about us.
You want to hear something funny?
I've had the same 18 months, and I never thought about us.
I mean, I simmered, I stewed...
...I cried my eyes out...
...but I never really thought.
Not until today.
Then I saw that you were right.
You did a lot for me, Nick.
That's what I'm going to remember.
What did I ever do for you, darling?
What did I ever give you that you couldn't have gotten for yourself?
A blue marble egg.
No one would have given me that but you.
And you...
You made me feel sort of...
...beautiful, you know...
...for a very long time.
You are beautiful.
Five minutes.
There are lots of people waiting for you.
Goodbye, Fanny.
Goodbye, Nick.

- Hey, Rodney.
- Don't stop now, man.
Hope you don't mind.
I just walked in.
Liberty Hall.
I'll be right with you.
Care for a taste, Chas?
Yeah, that'll go good, Rod.
Food and drink hasn't arrived yet.
Ought to be here any minute.
Found half a bottle of scotch, though.
I hear Rex don't know about these happenings tonight.
No, Delia wanted to surprise him.
Cheers.
Well, here's to their first anniversary.
Rex and Delia.
One year down and a long night to go.
[KNOCK AT DOOR]
Enter.
Good evening, sir. Where would you like the buffet placed?
Same as last time.
- You did bring plenty of champagne?
- The usual, sir.
Fine.
Well, now, here comes the talent!
- How are you, Tony?
- All right, Alan.
Nice to see you, Ray.
You boys know Charles Mingus?
Hey, Charles! I see you got here first.
Yeah, baby, and I'll be the last one to leave.
[LAUGHTER]
Tony asked me to give you this.
Oh, fine. Yes, let's have a look.
[HE WHISTLES]
Pop into the kitchen for me, will you?
Get me some hammer and tacks.
Bottom draw.
- Yes, sir.
- Take your things off, Ray.
I'll hang up this work of art.
Get the message?
[THUNDER]
You cats rehearsing the water ballet?
Hey, Cass, is this the place?
Yeah, this is the Honorable Rodney Hamilton's pad number four...
...known as "The Warehouse".
- Suivez-moi!
- Wow! This is spook city.
I don't like it. It's weird.
I thought you said...
...this guy was rich!
Rich? He's loaded.
A townhouse across the river, a shooting box up north, a villa down south.
- You name it, he's got it.
- But why here?
- What is this?
- Haven't you heard, honey?
Jazz is noisy. You can't have an all-night session in Mayfair.
Oh, I get it. Amateur night.
Oh, Rod's okay - a real jazz buff.
Whenever the big boys are in town he lays on a party.
[SOUND OF TAPPING AS
MUSICIANS TUNE UP]
Hi, there, Rod!
Hey, Cass, come on in!
Oh, ho, dig that billing!
Yeah, Johnny Cousin's idea.
- How are you?
- All right. This is Mac Shepherd.
- Hello.
- The Honorable Rodney Hamilton...
...and, er, Mike Garner.
- Hello, glad to know you.
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Colin.
Oh, this is, uh... what's your name, honey?
- Lucille.
- Yeah, this is Lucy...
...the girl I love.
- Great pad you got here.
- Once you GET here.
- Put your things in back, boys.
- Uh, take these.
- I'll give Rod a hand.
- Yep, sure.
See what they've brought us.
Want some food?
- No. Juice, man
- How did the show go?
Wild. They kept Rex at the piano for eight choruses of his last number.
- What time d'you think they'll get here?
- I don't know.
When we left the Festival Hall they were still arguing.
- Two scotch, please.
- Rex wanted to go home, but...
...Delia just had to fall by old Rod's for a drink.
Rex'll do anything Delia really wants.
Yeah, they're coming but, uh... he's pretty bugged.
How many, sir, will you require to remain and serve?
- Oh, two or three.
- Here you are, sir.
Fritz, Francois, William.
- Won't you need me, sir?
- Tuttle!
Oh, let him stay, he can make himself useful.
Very well, Mr Hamilton.
[MILITARY-STYLE RENDITION OF
"POP GOES THE WEASEL"]
[UPBEAT JAZZ MUSIC]
Now, here's the thing, Rod.
About this number.
- What number?
- Well, the one Delia's gonna do tonight.
I've been working with her on the whole tour.
Rex doesn't know a thing about it.
She wants to knock him back with this "new style" thing.
"New style"? Her old style's all right with me. I play her old records all the time.
I think she made a mistake giving up her career.
She felt being married to Rex was all the career she needed.
Rex is funny, isn't he?
Seems to want to keep her out of the public eye.
That was Delia's decision.
Now, look, Rod...
...when she does this number, how about doing the intro...
...y'know, something big, like, uh...
..."This is the real, the true, the great, the new Delia Lane."
- Like that, hmm?
- I'd be delighted...
..."unaccustomed as I am".
Tell me something, Cass - you're pretty chummy with them.
- What?
- Rex and Delia.
How's it gone, this, this first year?
Are they happy together?
Well, sure... isn't that why we're having this celebration?
You know what I mean?
No, I don't.
If she's through with singing, why's she working up...
...this new style? She's bored; she's itching to get back to work.
I could see that a month ago when I was in New York.
Well, Rex won't stop her.
Are you serious?
He's afraid to let her out of his sight.
Perhaps she doesn't want out of his sight.
You wouldn't have a little, um... wishful thinking going on there, would you?
Hi, Rod!
- Hi, Cass, how're you makin' out?
- Hi, Benny.
Hah, yes.
You left your horn in my room, baby - I found it under the bed.
Well, aint you the thorough little housekeeper?
What, um, city was that in?
"Saxville."
I figured if nobody called for it in thirty days...
...I could keep it. But it'd be just like you not to call, so...
- ...here it is.
- Thanks, Benny.
Don't mention it.
Courtesy of the house.
I um__.
...l, I think I'll make it for a few.
- Real swingers, these.
- Hmm. I ought to get this on tape.
Uh-oh.
Here comes "Cousin John".
Easy, now, don't drop 'em.
Just follow me.
Hiya, fellas!
[SHOUTS OF GREETING]
Ah, look, he brought all his own drums.
- I told him he could use mine.
- Yeah, but Joe's don't have his name on 'em.
Now, listen, you guys, when Rex and Delia come in, big triumphal deal.
Make it forte, okay?
Uh, Alan, set 'em up for me, would you?
And if anybody wants to sit in, say, uh...
[HI-HAT SNAP]
...there they are - okay?
[PLAYING SOLO]
Hi, Rodney.
Hi Johnny. Scotch?
- Yes, please.
- I thought you were bringing Rex and Delia's stuff?
And where's that poor little wife of yours?
If you're referring to lucky Emily - late as usual.
Er, Rex and Delia got trapped by the autograph hounds, but...
...they'll be right on my heels. I think we ought to post a sentry.
Er---
[CLICKS FINGERS]
- Yes, Mr Hamilton?
- What's your name, again?
Er, Tuttle, sir.
Tuttle, would you know Aurelius Rex, the band leader, if you saw him?
Oh, yes, sir! I'd know 'im.
Well, will you nip out onto the catwalk, through that door, there...
...and when you see him arrive, run in and tell me.
Yes, SIR!
- Emily... nice to see you.
- Hello, Rodney.
- Come on in.
- Hey, Emily!
See you later.
Yeah, we'll do a big, fat Mendelssohn for their entrance.
[HUMS "THE WEDDING MARCH"]
Isn't that rather corny?
What's cornier than an anniversary?
Can I put my coat upstairs?
Yeah, well, don't put it with the rest of the cats'...
...some of the talent might rub off.
Got some new tape equipment to show you, Johnny.
- That's great.
- Em's arrived.
- Nice to see you.
- How are ya?
- You were going to wait for me.
- Told you to be on time.
- I was only a minute late.
- Had to lug all those drums alone.
- Hey, it's Johnny Dankworth!
- Johnny!
Hello, nice to see you.
I'm so sorry Cleo couldn't make it.
Yeah?
- JOHNNY ON PHONE: Er, is that Mr Berger?
- Yeah?
Oh, Lou. Johnny Cousin here.
It's all set; and the money.
Rodney'll go for any amount I need.
Well, that's fine, Johnny.
How's Rex feel about this?
- What's the difference?
- What's the difference?
His drummer's forming his own band...
...his wife is gonna sing with his drummer
- a competitor - and you ask me...
..."What's the difference?"
Well, I want my own outfit - Rex knows this, it's no secret.
Look, I'm asking you, what does he feel about Delia singing with you?
So, he gets salty, we go ahead without Delia.
Johnny, I'll give it to you clearly.
I got more bands than I know what to do with, including Rex.
Now, you tell me you have
Delia Lane...
...a sound commercial property, and you got financial backing.
Am I interested? The answer is yes, I'm interested.
You tell me you've not got Delia Lane, a sound commercial property...
...am I still interested?
The answer is no...
...I am not interested.
Do you understand me'?
Don't worry, Lou.
We'll have her, all right.
That's fine, Johnny.
I'll come along to the party, anyway, pay my respects to Mr and Mrs Rex.
Heh. See you, Lou.

Delia, Delia, I'm so happy for you.
Don't get carried away - the first year's a cinch!
- Aw...!
- Congratulations.
Thank you, Rod.
This proves it again...
...the husband's always the last to know.
[LAUGHTER]
Delia's tricky, all right!
- Is Her Majesty pleased?
- Oh, very pleased.
What a lot of trouble you've gone to, Rod.
Can we kiss your old lady?
Absolutely not. There'll be no special favours and no illegal embraces.
Now, come on, Rex, give us a break, eh, man?
Back, back, you crazy fools!
Come on over, we've got the royal box waiting for you.
[REX LAUGHS]
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
- Come on, let's have a drink.
- Yes.
Poor Rex.
He was so tired tonight, all he wanted in the world...
...was to get back to the hotel.
Couldn't understand my sudden urge to go out on the town.
All right, so she had me fooled.
You should go out on the town more often, Delia.
- You weren't born to blush unseen.
- Don't plant ideas...
...just when I'm getting her properly trained.
I have found out what I really am.
A domestic animal.
Beautiful house-cat.
[LAUGHTER]
- Well! Dave Brubeck's made it.
- Hey, Dave!
- Hi!
- Dave, this really is a pleasure.
I didn't think you could make it!
Well, I didn't wanna pass up Rex's party.
- Hi.
- Glad to see you, Dave.
If I'd known you were coming I'd have had the piano tuned.
Ha, ha, hah! The way
Dave plays...
...any piano sounds good.
You're no slouch, Aurelius.
[REX LAUGHS]
- Oh. Anniversary present?
- No.
No, it's the first thing
Rex ever gave me.
I only use it on special occasions.
- Sentimental, hmm?
- You always were a cornball.
[MUTED TRUMPET PLAYING]
It's a good group, huh?
You were a dear to round them up, Johnny.
Thank you.
Oh, you know who else is coming tonight?
- Who?
- Lou Berger.
- Is he in London?
- Yeah.
But won't it cast a slight pall?
He's never been one for simple merry-making.
Oh, I told him about this new style of yours, and, um...
- ...he wants to hear it.
- Now, Johnny.
Berger may be the biggest booking agent in the business...
...but I'm not auditioning.
This is for fun. It's a surprise for Rex.
Now, I told you when Cass and I started working on it...
- ...don't make plans yet.
- All right, but...
...why waste the chance?
Look, I'd like Berger to come right out tonight, and say...
..."Johnny, Delia, I'm gonna book you."
"I'm gonna put you in the Palladium,
Copa, Las Vegas"---
It's not gonna work, Johnny.
- What?
- I know I said I'd think about it...
...and I have.
It won't work, and I can't do it.
Can't do it?
[DISMISSIVE LAUGH]
- Are you crazy?
- If I did, I... I'd lose Rex.
We'd lose each other.
Don't talk like that.
We've got too much at stake on this - both of us.
What do you mean,
"Both of us"?
I'm not gonna do it, Johnny.
I'm sorry.
Now, look, Delia...
...you're not the kind of girl to wait in the wings.
You wanna work.
You want it so much.
You can taste it.
[SAXOPHONE LOUDENS]
I am sorry, Johnny.
I know how long and how hard you've planned to have your own band.
[INCREDULOUS LAUGH]
If all you think this means to me is...
...is having my own band...!
You just don't know!
But, Johnny, you don't need me!
Yes, I do.
It's exactly what I do need, Delia.
I need you.
Because I want you.
Always have.
Johnny!
I mean it.
I, I made all of those plans - all of them...
[SPEAKING SOFTLY]
...because of you.
Johnny, I like you.
But don't talk to me like this again, ever.
Now we'll forget it - all right?
[MUSIC CRESCENDOS]
[BACKGROUND CHATTER AND LAUGHTER]
I can't tell you how pleased we both are with the way you've...
...taken hold and managed this tour.
Thanks to you, it's been the smoothest.
Oh, thanks a lot, Rex.
Well, I don't know what you two boys are drinking to...
...but whatever it is, count me in.
Here's to the man who introduced me to the woman...
...who has made me the happiest man in the world.
Well, it couldn't have happened to two nicer people.
And here's to the two men in my life.
[PIANO INTRO BEGINS]
[NUMBER ENDS]
[APPLAUSE]
Hey, Rod?
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- What about?
- Our deal.
- Is that still on?
Oh, it's on, and I'm ready.
Tonight's the night.
You surprise me. I thought we'd have to forget about that.
Forget about it? But we worked it all out...
...didn't we'?
I've had the impression since that
Delia's dragging her feet.
What gave you that idea? Even if she is, we go ahead without her.
Just you?
What do you mean, just me?!
Me and my band.
Twelve guys, every one of them a top man.
I've decided to put my money elsewhere.
- Holy smoke. Is that the McCoy?
- Like it?
- For Delia?
- Of course.
I thought I'd tape the session.
You must be crazy to offer a thing like that to Delia.
Why? She likes diamonds.
And it's her first anniversary.
Oh, ho! Man, are you tipping your hat!
What do you mean by that?
[HE LAUGHS SOFTLY]
Come off it, Rod.
You're speaking to "Cousin John".
Sol am.
What can I do for you...
..."Cousin John"?
Only what we said, Rod.
Twenty-five grand.
You mean Berger will back you without Delia?
Well, he will or he won't. What's the difference? There are plenty of agents.
- With you behind me---
- Johnny...
...when I said I might have a little spending money...
...I made no commitment with you at all.
But, I--- I...
...I've been working on this a year, I, I'm, er...
...borrowed up to the neck.
But Johnny, it isn't what we discussed.
Perhaps you misunderstood.
I said it might be fun to back a band for Delia.
Don't worry, Delia will be in this.
Is that so?
Oh, for crying out loud.
Take a look.
Rex has practically got her in solitary confinement.
How long do you think that marriage is going to last?
Maybe forever.
Look, I know the type.
There's only one way to get at her, and it's not with this stuff.
Look, Rex doesn't want her to sing, okay?
Not even with his own band.
Maybe he doesn't want their marriage in the limelight; I wouldn't know.
But I do know that Delia is an artist.
One day she's gonna go back to work.
When she does, they'll bounce apart. They're through.
Not according to Cass.
Cass?
Any putting asunder is highly unlikely in his opinion.
Cass told you that?
He did - and he should know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cass, uh, ought to know.
He certainly ought to know.
- Well, he's their best friend.
- Yeah.
Yeah...!
He certainly is!
[JOHNNY CACKLES AND ROD
LAUGHS QUIETLY]
- You seem to be amused.
- Well, I think it's funny.
- I don't know if you think it's funny.
- What's funny?
The idea of Cass reporting to you that everything's fine...
...in the Rex family. And I thought that chivalry was dead.
- I don't follow you.
- Rod...
...everybody knows that Delia's been going to see Cass at his hotel...
...every day of the tour.
They were rehearsing.
Wow. Are you from down home.
My wife knows all about it, she even went along sometimes to, er...
...to make it look good.
Are you saying Delia's in love with Cass?
Uh, did I say "love"?
No, no, she's moving on. She's going to fall right into our arms.
That's what you had in mind, wasn't it?
So use your money where you get some results, man!
Hi! What's going on, you two?
Can I play?
Do you mind... honey?
We're busy.
We'll... we'll talk later, Johnny.
You may be right about this.
It might be more appropriate for the second anniversary.
Yeah.
Dave still playing?
- Yes.
- Thanks for the "salty tears" bit.
What're you trying to do, make me look good?
Gee, I'm sorry, it---
[HESITANTLY]
You were in here so long.
Is something wrong?
Oh, nothing, go on, go back to your friends. Lush it up.
Wait a minute.
What's the story on
Cass and Delia?
- What do you mean?
- Anything ever go on?
Why, of course not. You know that
as well as I do.
What is it, Johnny?
Are you...
...planning something?
[STAMMERING SLIGHTLY]
Ah, now, whatever I'm doing, it's...
...my business, understand?
Stay out of it...
...don't ask questions, don't talk.
That way we'll get along fine.
Oh, sure Johnny, you know I never talk about your business.
Honey, please?
I wish you wouldn't.
- Not, not tonight.
- Ah, Emily, honey...
...get out, will ya?
Leave me alone.
[DELICATE FLUTE INTRO]
[RHYTHM BEGINS]
[THUNDERCLAP]
[UP-TEMPO MUSIC]
I'll trot over and see to the boys' drinks.
Not that I'll be missed here!
Oh...!
[DELIA GIVES A LITTLE LAUGH]
I'm sorry I was so stupid.
I couldn't understand why you wanted to go out.
Tonight, of all nights, I just wanted to be alone with you.
This time you didn't get your own way.
- Do I usually?
- Usually!
But tonight I had to be stubborn.
They went to such a lot of trouble to keep it secret...
...and surprise you.
All the surprise I need is that I still have you.
I've been worried sometimes.
Oh... you mustn't worry about us.
I'm afraid I keep you away from things you should have.
There's nothing else I want.
You know that.
That's what I wanna believe.
But...
[HE SIGHS]
...then I wake up at night in a cold sweat...
...thinking you've gone away.
Where would I go?
I don't know.
Some place where I can't follow.
But then I see you're still there beside me and I swear...
...I'll never let you out of my sight.
Silly, isn't it?
Yes.
Will you ever be sorry...
...that you married me?
Never.
You don't feel in an alien world?
Don't say that.
Isn't this a wonderful party!
- Marvellous.
- I think I'll move in for a few.
Yeah - go, man, go.
Is that my face or is this Hallowe'en?
Shall we join the ladies?
[PIANO INTRO]
[SLOW-TEMPO PIECE BEGINS]
Oh, I'll have to straighten up.
Johnny hates it when I drink.
You know why you and Rex are so perfect together?
- No, why?
- Well, because...
- ...you gave up so much for him.
- Oh, I didn't give up so much, really.
Oh, yes, you did - a big career.
Oh, well, I didn't have then what I have now.
I was lonely.
Never thought I'd find a man like Rex.
Hmm. Honestly...
...don't you miss it?
The excitement, and all?
Yes.
Yes, I do, I... I miss working.
I miss it very much.
But don't you tell that to anybody, do you hear?
- You know I wouldn't.
- Besides, it was my own idea to quit.
Rex wouldn't marry me till I did.
And then he saw that I put him above everything else in the world.
Oh. Did I ever tell you about Johnny and me?
- How we got married?
- No.
Well, I was still in high school...
...and a bunch of us kids went to a session one night, and...
...well, there was Johnny.
Oh, I got this awful crush on him right away.
'Course, he couldn't see me at all.
Used to drive me crazy.
L- I went to see him everywhere he played.
And this time, I... I heard he was playing a gig down in Maryland.
In... in a roadhouse.
So my girlfriend got a car, and...
...well, we just drove down there.
He was staying in a motel.
And I... well, I...
...I stayed with him.
All weekend.
And so on Sunday...
...everybody was in his room.
The boys were getting juiced.
And this piano player said... have a wild idea. Let's all get married!"
So we did.
Isn't that romantic?
But you wanted to marry him, didn't you?
Oh, yes.
But I... I don't think that
Johnny would've...
...married me if he hadn't been drunk.
Well... you're still together.
All the others got annulled.
But Mama said...
..."You'll give it a try, or
Johnny'll go to jail."
So we gave it a try.
Here we are.
Is he mean to you, honey?
Oh, no. Um...
...he's not mean, exactly.
But, I... there's one thing I'm pretty sure of: he, he doesn't play around.
Why, I don't think he cares at all about other women.
It'll sound funny, but, I'm...
...sorry for him.
Well, he's so talented, and...
- ...smart, isn't he?
- Yes.
- Yes, he is.
- He makes all these plans all the time.
He worries so... why, he sometimes stays up all night trying to figure things out.
Nothing ever works.

[NUMBER BEGINS]
Let's, um... go outside a minute.
Let's get some air.
- You rehearsed the boys for Delia's song?
- Mmm.
How's your big deal comin' along?
It's coming.
These schemes of yours... you never know when you're well-off.
Yeah, I know, you told me.
Rex is an institution.
I helped to make him one.
I owe him nothin'.
Maybe you wanna blow sideman for the rest of your life...
...while somebody else sticks the bows and the loot.
I'm thirty-five years old and I'm nowhere.
Okay, 0K3)'-
So it's your turn, be a big man, Daddy.
[JOHNNY LAUGHS DRYLY]
Did you, uh, did you want one?
- I fixed a few, just in case.
- No, thanks, man, I don't use it any more.
- Huh?
- Oh, yeah, sure, no hard stuff.
- But you don't include this"?
- Ah, put it down. No more - nothin'.
Huh'? Doctor's orders?
- Hmm?
- Or something your psychoanalyst told you?
Or was it Rex that said nuh-uh?
Now, listen, Johnny...
...I owe Rex something, don't I?
When I got busted, he's the one bailed me or I'd be in jail right now.
When I was sick he sent me off for the cure...
...when I was wigging he got me this head shrinker.
I mean, Rex was great.
And if he don't like pot...
...then juice is good enough for me.
All right, all right, don't flip.
Fine. I'm all for it.
[DRY LAUGH]
Life's funny, though, isn't it?
I mean, you kick one habit and you get another.
Er, "father image", it's called, isn't it?
You kiddin', man?
Oh, I sympathise. I mean, if a guy can't make a move on his own, it's just...
...another way of being hooked, isn't it?
Rex never did - never does - tell me what to do.
No?
Ah, that's no problem, anyhow, it's...
[SIGHS]
...just a symbol to me.
Oh, sure.
So, uh... I'll take a pull.
Oh, come on, now.
Let's not get reckless.
Come on, come on.
Oh, leave well enough alone. You don't antagonise the old man.
[FORCEFULLY]
I said, give.
All right.
Don't tell the boss I turned you on, though.
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
[PATTER OF RAIN AND
CHURCH BELL RINGING THE TIME]
D'you know Berger's comin' tonight?
Yeah?
Yeah, you know I've always admired the way you handle that guy.
[LAUGHS]
I got him fooled.
He even thinks I like him.
Yeah, I know, but the way that you don't let him know that you know.
- I know what?
- That he's never liked the idea of...
...you managing the band.
Yeah?
- I'm doin' all right.
- Ah, yeah, sure.
I mean, he doesn't understand what
Rex is trying to do for you...
...why he made you band manager.
I'm doin' my job.
Sure you are, sure.
[LAUGHS]
Oh, I loved that cable, though, that Berger sent to Rex.
"Are we running a business or a mental institution?"
Did he say that?
Ah, come on, now, Cass.
You know Berger's not too bright.
Rex doesn't take any notice...
...of things like that.
Did you want these?
I never wanted the damn job in the first place.
Oh, hang on to 'em, I'll pick 'em up later.
[SIGHS]
That's pretty good stuff.
[MUSIC]
[NUMBER ENDS]
- Have a drink, Delia.
- No thanks, Rod.
- But have you got a cigarette?
- Yeah, sure.
Did you see a case around? It's sort of squarish and gold.
It has stones on it.
No.
If it's here, we'll find it.
Well, it's here. I know I had it when I came.
[DOOR SLAMS]
Hi, Cass.
Rodney, guess who's here.
The great Lou Berger.
Thanks, Benny. Thrilled?
I'm truly underwhelmed.
Why don't you tape the session?
I haven't quite got the hang of this new equipment yet.
You know who's an expert?
Johnny Cousin.
He can tear 'em down and set 'em up.
[HE GIVES A LITTLE LAUGH]
Yeah, I'll have a word with him.
Move over, honey.
Where'd you go last night?
Nowhere.
I'm not used to being walked out on in those circumstances.
I'm sorry, Benny.
Makes a girl feel funny.
Why did you leave?
I felt like walkin'.
You never felt like walkin' before.
Honey... don't you remember?
It's kinda warm.
I think I'll get some air.
Yes, do that - or take a little swim in the Thames.
That'll cool you off.
[HE SLAMS THE DOOR]
How's it going, Rex?
- All right, thanks to you.
Things are good.
- How's the concert?
- Hello, Rodney!
- Glad you made it.
- Ah, well, you know Sam Phales, of course.
This is, er, Paco O'Toole.
The Honourable Rodney Hamilton.
- How d'you do? I'll get you a chair.
- I was in South America...
...a couple of weeks ago. Paco was the hottest thing there.
What do you play, Mr O'Toole?
- I am baterista.
- That's "drums" to you.
[LAUGHTER]
The drums.
[SAXOPHONE SOLO]
Hey, Cass.
Here's Lou.
- Hope you'll play for us tonight.
- Sure, sit in, Paco.
Johnny'll lend you his drums, right, Johnny?
Ha, ha, I think he'd have more fun with Rodney's, complete with...
...bongos, congas, maracas and genuine native oil cans.
I would just enjoy to listen to Mr Cousin, whose work I know well from the records.
Me?! Oh, I belong to that new minority group...
...white American jazz musicians.
They're gonna hold a mass-meeting in a phone booth. Ha, ha, ha!
[REX CHUCKLES]
[SAM LAUGHS]
I'll get you a drink.
Maybe you'd like to meet some of the guys?
Oh, with much pleasure.
- You will excuse us?
- Sure, go ahead, Paco.
What's the matter with Cass?
- Sam, tell him to come over.
- I'll get him, Lou.
Excuse me.
We're on.
Everyone's like jumpin' jacks.
Hey, Rex. Come up a minute.
Got a phone call.
Oh. You sure?
Oh, come on.
No. No, no.
But why?
I might shove his cigar right down his throat, that's why.
Why the sudden tantrum?
Has something happened?
Oh, I, I... er...
- ...just wanted to talk to you for a minute.
- What's the matter?
[SIGHS]
About Cass.
What about him?
Why, I'm fond of Cass - you know that.
Look, Johnny, what is it?
- It--- it's his problem, man.
- What problem?
The funny ones.
He's turned on again.
How do you know that?
I saw.
No, I'm not saying it's a...
...crime or anything, but he just can't handle it.
He goes right out of his head.
Like that time in
Newport, when you were sick.
He just disappeared. Everybody was out looking for him!
Including Delia.
Didn't she tell you?
[SOUND OF TOM-TOMS]
Hey! Is that the Brazilian pistol?
[BAND BEGINS TO PLAY]
I've done a good job for Rex.
And the hardest part was getting into bed with Berger and his goons.
"Be nice to Berger", that's been my motto.
Oh, baby... you're huffing and you're puffing over nothing.
Come on, now, forget it and come say hello.
I wouldn't worry about it, Rex.
About what?
Why, about, er... anything.
I just meant they're such old friends.
I mean, she knew him before she knew you, didn't she?
Of course she did.
He introduced us.
- She's very fond of him.
- Why shouldn't she be?
We all are.
I'd really like to know what you're talking about.
Did I miss a sentence?
Rex.
I've been with you for six years now.
You're the straightest guy in the world.
I owe you a lot.
We all do.
Maybe it's because I just don't like...
...the way it makes you look.
[MUSIC LOUDENS]
All right, Johnny.
Let's have it.
Oh, that's the trouble - there's nothing to tell, it's just...
...just talk.
Maybe because she goes to his room every day.
- Who's room?
- Case's. For the rehearsals.
What rehearsals?
Didn't she tell you?
What else have you got to say?
Nothing.
Don't blame Cass, though.
I mean, there must be ten guys got eyes for her.
- Including you?
- What?
You like her, too?
Oh, look here, Rex, I...
I don't wanna get in the middle here.
No kidding. Let's drop it.
Fine.
Let's drop it.
- Cass, how are you?
- Hi.
- Swinging cat, huh?
- Sit down, enjoy it.
[NUMBER ENDS]
[CLAPPING]
Rex...?
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
[SOFT, GENTLE OPENING NOTES]
[SLOW-TEMPO NUMBER AND
BACKGROUND CHATTER]
- Your Brazilian boy's good.
- You know what?
Figure you got a new star.
Oh, the kid's got it, all right.
Personality - and a great background for a build-up.
I'm talking to Mr Berger.
You're gonna build him up?
We'll see.
It must be fun to be a star-maker...
...especially when you don't know anything about jazz.
- I thought you said he was good?
- Ah, ha, but...
...when I say he's good and when you say he's good, that's two different things.
Take it easy, Cass.
I don't care who says he's good as long as he makes money.
[DISMISSIVE LAUGH]
Tell me, Mr Berger, do you agree with Coriat that...
...the content of music is pure libido symbolism?
Huh?
Coriat?
What instrument does he play?
[LAUGHTER]
Or perhaps you agree with Margolis...
...who says that music represents regressive narcissism.
You've heard of Margolis?
I've met him.
Where on earth would
YOU have met him?
Well, since you know him, you're acquainted with his hypothesis...
...that jazz is most appreciated by three groups.
Negroes, adolescents, and intellectuals.
So...?
Well, you ain't no Negro,
Mr Berger...
...and you're not adolescent...
...and as for the third group---
[DISMISSIVE SNICKER]
Hey... what is this?
Come on, Cass, sit in for a while.
The lecture's great, but, uh...
...you're better on the horn.
But there's another possibility.
Maybe you're a musician yourself.
Do you play an instrument,
Mr Berger?
- The boy's out of his head!
- I'm out of my head, all right!
Like every other hand-licker you've got working for you!
How many guys you got blowing their heads off...
...for a scale right now?
- And who gets the bread?!
- Cut it out, Cass.
I'm sorry, Lou.
Cass isn't too well.
Don't apologise for me, Rod.
I never felt better.
D'you hear that, Mr Berger?
I feel fine.
- Get him outta here.
- Come on, buster.
- You can't talk to Mr Berger like that.
- Who can't?!
I'll talk to him any way I like.
Play, boys, play!
I will talk to him any way I like!
What's the matter?
What's going on here?
Leave him alone, will ya?
What're you gonna do, Rex?
He's out of his head!
- What the---
- Cass, let's get some air, let's take---
- Let me go!
- Come on, baby.
I'd like some air.
Come on, Cass.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
[SWING NUMBER]
In all my life I never saw behaviour like that.
Yeah. He came over here and insulted Lou.
- In very insulting terms.
- Lou?
Lou... you gotta overlook it.
- He's a very sick boy.
- "Sick"?
- He's stoned.
- Come and sit down.
- Lou?
- I'll get you something to eat.
Something special.
You've got some funny people working for you, Rex.
I told you before about this boy.
Ah, don't hold it against him, Lou.
- He's in a big emotional snarl.
- What snarl?
Tomorrow he won't even remember it.
- I'll remember it.
- Yeah.
He made a big mistake there.
- It'll boomerang on him.
- I tell you, Lou...
...he's not responsible when he's high.
I don't do business with people who aren't responsible, Rex.
So I advise you to get a new road manager.
I'm very sorry, Lou. I hope you'll accept my apology for this.
I'm not blaming you, but I don't have to put up with him...
...just because he's such a good friend of yours and Delia's.
Well, you know something?
Eventually he'll finish up in the cackle academy.
Table it, Sam, and listen to the music...
...with the rest of us jazz lovers.
Here we are, Lou.
- Nice plate of sturgeon for you.
- Thanks, Rod.
Excuse me.
But I had to do it.
He had it coming to him, the slob.
[SHE SIGHS]
Shouldn't have insisted on you talking to him.
I'm sorry... keeping you up here like this.
[DOOR SQUEAKS]
[MUSIC IN BACKGROUND]
Rex, I'm sorry.
What are you sorry about?
Well, for what happened down there.
We've been through this thing before, I think.
I said I'm sorry, man.
Sure.
You think I haven't been straight with you, don't you'?
This is the first time it's happened.
The first time since when?
Since you pulled me out.
Do you mind going downstairs, Delia?
- I'll join you in a minute.
- Rex...
...I know. I promised.
And he did keep his promise.
I don't like this at all, Cass.
[DOOR CLOSES]
I'm not a probation officer.
How you come on in your private life is your own affair.
But Berger was booking me before you blew middle C.
And now you're finished with him.
I'll apologise.
I hate him, and his whole rotten racket!
But I'll apologise.
You won't have to. You're not going to see him anymore.
What d'you mean?
I like you fine, Cass.
And you're a good musician.
But I'm not going to have any hop-head running my business.
Oh, man, you're taking this too big!
You seem to have a lot of troubles.
A lot of things on your mind.
I think you'd better cool it a while.
I think you need a vacation.
Does that mean I'm fired?
For the time being.
You still seeing that psychoanalyst?
I think you need more frequent consultations.
- Rex, I can---
- We can talk about you...
...coming back to the band later.
In a couple of months.

[HE SIGHS]
Brought you a drink, Cass.
- No, thank you.
- What's going on, baby?
What was that scene with Berger?
I lost my head, that's all.
You're wearing it now.
Yeah... I came to about a beat and a half behind.
And slightly after Rex fired me.
Fired you? You're kidding!
- What--- What happened?
- Rex fired him!
Cass?!
Oh, no, I don't believe it.
He, he didn't mean it.
- He meant it, all right.
- He'll change his mind.
- No he won't.
- Well, don't, don't feel so bad.
We all love you.
There's a thought, Cass.
- What?
- Delia.
Get her to talk to him.
Oh, I wouldn't wanna bug him any more than he is.
Well, Rex wouldn't refuse
Delia tonight...
...even if she asked him to move to Johannesburg!
Johnny's right, Cass.
Did I say that?!
Cass, you stay right here - we'll go and get her. C'mon, Rod.
Sure.
[JOHNNY CLICKS HIS FINGERS]
- Cass?
- Yeah?
- Why are you like this?
- I'm not, Benny.
What's the matter, baby?
I thought we loved each other.
What's gone wrong?
Is it all over with us?
Is it?
Look, I've got things on my mind, baby.
We've always levelled with each other, Cass.
That's all I want you to do...
- ...just level with me.
- Later, eh?
Hey Cass... you got that case?
Hmm?
What's with that chick, anyway?
- Who?
- Benny.
Whaddya mean, "What's with her?"
Well, are you... still making it with her?
What are you, the FBI?
[HE GIVES A LITTLE LAUGH]
Well, I was just wondering.
You seemed so close there for a while, I thought maybe you were...
...in love, or something.
[CASS SNORTS]
Well, she's the greatest.
That's the truth.
[SIGHING]
But it can't go on this way.
Yeah, I-l know how you feel.
It's, uh...
...it's tough getting out of a thing like that, isn't it?
Deep down, I don't want out.
Benny's wonderful.
I really think I love that chick.
But it's been going on too long this way.
I don't wanna hang her up forever...
I don't wanna get married, either.
I just can't seem to make up my mind.
Well, would she marry you, do you think?
She's come on like she would.
You gotta do something when it gets like that.
Still, you've had a good time up to now.
Oh, man... have I had a good time.
But the pressure's on.
I'm back in panicsville.
It'll work out. Oh, uh...
...do---- do you want this back?
Nah, you keep it.
I don't want it on me.
[KNOCKING AT DOOR]
[MUSIC HEARD FROM DISTANCE]
Hi, Delia.
- They tell ya?
- I know, you're banished.
The Iron Gates are closed.
- Oh, you're funny.
- Well, I'll, uh...
...go and leave you two to your lovemaking.
You seem to think the world ended...
...just because you spoke a few hasty words to Uncle Lou.
- I still love you.
- Mmm.
What about your number?
He's so salty, if I go out there now...
...the whole thing'll be a big nowhere scene.
Hey, you didn't hear me.
I said, "I love you."
[CASS GIVES A LITTLE GRUNT]
And so does Rex.
Come on, now. I don't want you sulking in here.
You leave Rex to me.
- Okay.
- I'll fix it for you.
[MUSIC]
- Saved you a drink.
- Thank you.
Hey... Rex.
Excuse me.
Found out something. He, er... talked to me.
- You don't have to worry.
- What do you mean'?
- Tell you later.
- I asked you a question.
What d'you mean,
I don't have to worry?
It's nothing, Rex. It'll keep.
I want to know what you're talking about.
All right.
Let's go inside.
All right, let's have it.
Wai--- I didn't think you were gonna take it like this, Rex.
Start talking.
Well, I... I-I-I guess I'll never learn.
Y-you know, I shouldn't have said a word. Now you've got...
...now you've got Cass all wrong.
If this is about my firing him...
...just leave that to me.
I'm doing what's right for him.
No, no, I'm talking about the other thing that had you worried...
...about him and Delia spending so much time together rehearsing.
Well, I... I found out what's behind it.
What's behind it?
Well, you know how Cass has always felt about Delia.
Her talent, and all - and who can blame him?
Yes?
When she married you, and decided to retire...
...Cass told her she was out of her head.
L-I mean, to let so much talent go to waste.
Well, now he's been trying to get her interested again.
That's all there's to it.
Nothing personal.
[DRY LAUGH]
- Okay, John. Thanks for the word.
- Oh, that's all right. I, er...
...I just thought that you'd, uh... you'd like to know.
Yeah.
Do me a favour, will ya'?
Oh, sure, Rex.
Drop that Sherlock Holmes bit.
That hat looks funny on you.
I'm happy about you and Delia, and I hope it goes on forever.
Thanks, Benny.
Uh...
...how're things with you and Cass?
Not good.
Oh? What's wrong?
I don't know.
The critics predicted a long run.
So did I, but all of a sudden he's running the other way.
That's funny.
Yeah, but it hurts when I laugh.
Hello, darling.
Now... what's the matter?
Don't you love me anymore?
Mmm.
Hey... are you tired?
- Hmm.
- 'Cause we can sleep all day tomorrow.
Delia.
Delia.
- May I intrude?
- Oh, sorry, Rod.
Would Your Majesty oblige?

Poor Cass.
He's so unhappy.
He seems to have recovered nicely.
No, he hasn't.
He feels so badly about what happened.
He should.
Oh, come on.
You know you're gonna forgive him.
Why don't you do it tonight?
It won't hurt him to cool a while.
Well... will you do it soon?
I don't know.
If you were to ask me a favour tonight,
I wouldn't refuse you.
But, Delia...
...this is a business matter.
Why are you so concerned?
Because I love you both.
Oh.
I see.
Well, you seem more interested in
Case's problems than mine.
Oh, Rex!
Cass is our oldest friend.
Berger's a top booking agent.
If Cass is going to make juvenile scenes...
...I don't want him.
What's the matter, darling?
I'm getting a little headache.
It's all right.
Oh, I'll get you some aspirin.
I'll get them.
[MUSIC LOUDENS]
Delia...
...I've been so busy on this tour...
...and you've had nothing to do.
Why, darling - I saw sights.
And nobody but Emily to be with all day?
Ah, don't worry - we had fun.
I should've had...
...Cass spend some time with you, shouldn't I?
Oh, I think...Cass has been as busy as you have.
What's wrong with Rex?
- A headache.
- He's gone to get some aspirin.
- Well, there's some right here.
What'd he say?
Cass, I don't know.
He's acting so funny tonight.
I don't think he feels well.
Oh, he'll come round.
But, look, could we do the number now?
- As soon as he comes down?
- Okay, I'll round up some of the guys.
Gonna do it now? That's great.
I'll take this up and stall him a second.
Here y'are, Dad, got something here'll soon fix you up.
Thanks.
Feeling a little low, huh?
It's just a little headache.
It'll go.
Yeah, I know.
Must, uh, must be lots of things bugging you. Here 'y'are, Rex.
Now, this should do the trick.
Oh, Rex, er, I know you said no more bulletins.
But I'm not sure I made myself clear down there.
- I got the drift.
- No, uh...
...when I said "Don't worry about it",
I really meant it.
He's not serious about her.
What the hell are you getting at?
I... I'm sorry, Rex - nothing.
Nothing? We'll see, nothing.
Well, I, I only thought it meant something when she started giving him presents.
Presents? What presents?
Oh... little tokens, like a... a gold cigarette case.
Things like that.
A gold cigarette case...?
Yeah, I... I saw it.
You're crazy.
No, all-all I'm saying is... th-that's why I talked to him, because...
...well, I thought he was trying to break up your marriage.
You take a lot on yourself, don't you?
You don't wanna hear what he said?
What'd he say?
Uh, that it, uh... it, wasn't serious... didn't wanna marry her...
...and he, uh, he's happy enough the way things are.
Cass couldn't say that.
- He couldn't.
- Yeah, I know, I...
...I could hardly believe it myself.
But the trouble is, I...
I've got proof.
- I've recorded it.
- You what?!
[HE GIVES A LITTLE LAUGH]
Yeah... it's all on tape.
Well, what he told me, and, uh, what he said to her...
...wh-when they were alone together, in the library.
- You listened?!
- Oh, no. No, no - it was an accident.
Th-the tapes were rolling, see - I thought of recording a couple of the numbers.
And when I played it back...
Well, there it was.
If you doubt any of this, Rex, you've only got to listen to the tape.
Or-or we can forget it.
Erase the whole thing.
What's your stake in this?
Huh?
[DRUM ROLL BEGINS]
- Oh! They're ready for you.
- What"?
Oh, we, we gotta go.
You don't wanna hear that tape.

I want a drink.
- Never mind that. Come on.
- Oh, for heaven's sakes!
Well, what is it?
Rex.
It seems that... Delia's been spending a lot of time with Cass.
Well, he's been working with her.
- Every day?
- Well, I guess so.
Every day on tour she was supposed to have been shopping with you...
...or sightseeing, or whatever it is you do.
Oh, well, she wanted to surprise you.
- Did you go with her?
- To see Cass?
[HESITANTLY]
Well, I guess so... sometimes.
I went with her once in Paris.
- What happened?
- Well... nothing.
We just went to see Cass at his hotel and we all had a drink...
- ...and then they went upstairs---
- They went upstairs...?
I told you - they were practising.
Hon-honestly, Rex... aren't you being a little silly?
Rex - come and join us.
Delia wants you.
- Come here a minute, Rod.
- Well...
...I can go and get my drink now?
Anything wrong?
I'm speaking to you, Rod, in the strictest of confidence.
Is that clear?
- Well, yeah...! What's the matter?
- That's clear, is it?
Well, yes, of course, Rex, but
I don't understand--
Have you heard any gossip? about my wife?
- Gossip?
- You heard me.
You know what I mean.
Well?
Look, whatever this is about...
...don't you think perhaps you'd better ask her?
I'm asking you.
Oh, now, look, Rex.
Has there been any talk?
I really couldn't say, er---
Why can't I get a straight answer around here?
I'm asking you as a friend.
Will you look at me?
[ROD SIGHS UNEASILY]
I want the whole story.
Is this meeting open to the public?
Will you excuse me a moment?
Are you feeling better, darling?
Was I that bad'?
Rex?
Rex, I'm really worried about you.
You must be sick.
Let me feel your forehead, darling.
Are you still angry about Cass?
Is that it?
I've never seen you like this before.
Oh... Why don't you make up with him?
You know how nice and sweet
Cass really is.
Have you got a cigarette?
_ Gig---
- You must have a cigarette.
In your... gold case?
Oh...! Why, darling, I'm afraid
I've misplaced it.
It's around, though.
Delia.
Delia.
What are you?
Why, I'm your wife.
That's what I am.
If you ever crossed me...
I don't know what I'd do.
[MUSIC PLAYING AT DISTANCE]
[STACCATO PIANO PLAYING]
What d'you say, huh?
We'll get Berger aside and
I'll make our pitch once and for all.
We could settle it before he leaves.
We've got the dough, we're going to have Delia.
Meet him on Monday and sign up.
Okay?
All right, Johnny,
I'll go along with you.
That's great.
You'll never regret it.
Why are you so stubborn, Rex?
The girl's an artist. She's got as much right to work as you have.
I'm not stopping her.
Rex, you don't listen. I'm explaining, you gotta TELL her to go back.
You gotta tell her YOU want it.
Lou, Lou.
No more tonight.
All right, all right.
I'm sorry if I'm impertinent.
I know what they say:
I only think of the money.
That's not strictly true, Rex.
This is a fine girl.
She loves you.
But she'll be happier if she's using her talents.
Think about it, Rex.
Goodnight, Johnny.
[BREATHLESSLY]
So long, Lou. Be seein' ya.
L, er, I don't like the idea of that thing lying around.
What d'you say I erase it, huh?
[REX SIGHS]
- Nice party.
- Thank you.
Are you backing Johnny and
Delia for sure?
- That's the idea. Call me Monday.
- For sure.
- Come on, Pac.
- Nice to meet you, Paco.
See you, Lou.
I just hope you and Johnny know what you're doing.
Goodnight, Rod.
What d'you say, I wipe it, we forget the whole thing, huh?
No. I wanna hear it.
What, what's the point?
What good'll it do?
I'm gonna hear that tape, Johnny.
- Oh, Rex, please---
- Now.
All right... if that's the way you want it.
Lock the door.
Well, er...
...Cass, uh... Cass was there.
- Urn... the mic was right---
- Get it over with.
Okay. Er... it begins somewhere, um...
...somewhere around here. We were talking about Delia.
[JOHNNY ON RECORDING]
"Still making it with her?"
[CASS ON RECORDING]
"What are you, the FBI?"
[JOHNNY ON RECORDING]
"Well, I was just wondering."
[JOHNNY ON RECORDING]
"You were so close for a while, I...
..."thought maybe you were in love, or something."
[CASS ON RECORDING]
"Ah, she's the greatest. That's the truth."
[CASS ON RECORDING]
"But it can't go on this way."
[JOHNNY ON RECORDING]
"it's tough getting out of a thing like that"...
..."i$n'l it?"
[CASS ON RECORDING]
"Deep down, I don't want out."
[CASS ON RECORDING]
"I really think I love that chick"...
..."but it's been going on too long this way."
[CASS ON RECORDING]
"I don't wanna hang her up forever."
[JOHNNY ON RECORDING]
"Would she walk out on Rex?"
[CASS ON RECORDING]
"She's come on like she would."
[CASS ON RECORDING]
"You gotta do something when it gets like that."
[JOHNNY ON RECORDING]
"Still, you've had a good time up to now."
[CASS ON RECORDING]
"Oh, man... have I had a good time."
And then he handed me this.
[CASS ON RECORDING]
"Nah, you keep that."
"I don't want it on me."
Here's where Delia came in.
[CASS ON RECORDING]
"Hi, Delia. Did he tell ya?"
[DELIA ON RECORDING]
"I know, you're banished."
[DELIA ON RECORDING]
"The Iron Gates are closed."
[CASS ON RECORDING]
"Oh, you're funny."
[CASS ON RECORDING]
"Oh, I'll, er, leave you two to your lovemaking."
That's where I left. Now, just listen.
[SOUND OF DOOR CLOSING
ON RECORDING]
[DELIA ON RECORDING]
"You seem to think the world ended"...
..."just because you spoke a few hasty words to Uncle Lou."
[DELIA ON RECORDING]
"I still love you."
[DELIA ON RECORDING]
"I said, 'I love you."'
[DELIA ON RECORDING]
"You leave Rex to me. I'll fix it for you."
[SOUND OF DOOR CLOSING]
That... that's it.
I'm... I'm sorry, Rex.
You did say you wanted to hear it, didn't you?
[THUNDERCLAP]
[THUNDER]
[THUNDER CONTINUES]
Rex?
[DELIA SCREAMS]
Rex!
Open the door, Delia.
[POUNDING CONTINUES AS MUSIC STOPS]
Open up!
I said open this door, Delia.
[GUESTS AND MUSICIANS TALKING]
Rex. Rex!
Delia! Rex!
Rex?
Please, what's happening?
Rex, open up!
No! No...!
[HAMMERING ON DOOR]
What have you done to me?
What have you done to me?!
You and Cass.
[CHOKED SOBBING]
There was nothing!
There is nothing!
[FRANTIC HAMMERING ON DOOR]
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
No...!
[CRASH]
[DRAMATIC STING]
Rex!
[CASS CRIES OUT AND WOMAN SCREAMS]
[HORRIFIED GASPS AND SHRIEKS]
What did he do it for?
Rex, have you gone crazy?
You'll kill him.
What has he done to you?
He hasn't done a thing!
- What has he done?
- Ask your husband.
Johnny? What do you mean, what do you mean?
- What did he tell you?
- Now, take it easy, Rex.
Wh-what did Johnny tell you?
Cass and Delia.
Johnny, did you?
It's a lie.
Johnny is a liar.
He always was. He's a liar.
He never told the truth in his whole life.
In his whole, miserable life!
He's a terrible... terrible... liar.
Ask him, then! Ask anybody in this room!
- They all know!
- Rex, I didn't say anything---
- You didn't have to say it!
- Rex, I swear...
...I don't know anything about this.
I only know what Johnny told me.
Ask him then! Ask him, before I tear him apart.
They had a good time?
Has it been going on too long?
I heard it all. I heard you talking to Johnny! He taped it!
He proved it to me.
That's right. In there.
I heard you talking about her.
I'll kill you for this, Cass.
Now or later!
Rex, listen a minute. Listen!
Cass, who were you talkin' about?
Who were you talkin' about when you were talkin' to Johnny?
Was it me, Cass? Was it me'?
It's true, Rex.
If you were talking about me, and not about Delia...
...Johnny musta known that.
Johnny knew that, didn't he?
Of course he knew.
He asked me.
[BENNY SOBS QUIETLY]
You fixed the tape, Johnny...?
You fixed that tape.
Why did you do that?
' No!
' Rex!
REX!
Don't worry, man
Everything's cool.
Doctor's on his way.
Rex!
Rex!
Rex.
Y-you...
...you're going home.

[SOUND OF AMBULANCE DRIVING AWAY]

Johnny, I... brought your coat.
[HI-HAT SNAPS GENTLY]
[HE TAPS DRUMS AND STICKS LIGHTLY]
We must go.
Please, Johnny.
WhY don't you go.
Without you?
Sure.
Walk out on me, like all the others did.
No.
[HE GIVES A LITTLE LAUGH]
Yeah.
Nothing'd ever make YOU walk out on me, would it?
I love you.
Don't you understand?
I don't wanna be loved.
But, Johnny---
[HE HITS DRUM HARD]
"But, Johnny."
[LOUD DRUM SMASH]
"But, Johnny, I love you."
"I love you."
[RAPID DRUMMING]
"I love." You love. She loves.
Everybody loves everybody.
Well, I don't, see?
I love nobody.
Don't even love Johnny.
Get out, Emily.

Good day to you, ma'am.
Would this be the home of
Mr. Anthony J. Drexel Biddle?
It would.
I've come to be interviewed for the position of the butler.
Mrs. Biddle does the interviewin'.
She's not at home just now.
But I had an appointment.
The Mayflower Employment Agency.
I'll tell Mrs. Biddle that you were put out about it.
Oh.
Not at all.
I'd be pleased to call again.
Good day to ya.
What part of Ireland?
County Tyrone.
Just new here, are ya?
The day before yesterday.
Oh, well, perhaps you'd like to wait in the kitchen.
Mrs. Biddle will be comin' home soon.
That's very kind of you.
Thank you very much.
Faith, 'tis a grand place you have here.
I'm the housekeeper here.
Me name's Mrs. Worth.
Mine's John Lawless.
This way, John Lawless.
Have a seat, and I'll pour you some coffee.
Don't you be troubling yourself.
No trouble.
There's a pot brewing on the stove.
Sit down.
Would you be from Ireland yourself, Mrs. Worth?
I came over as young girl.
Not long ago, then.
Tell me, Mrs. Worth, what became of the last butler?
I couldn't say.
He left in the dead of night after being here less than a month.
We've got a servant problem in this house.
No use sayin' we don't.
Must be hard working for the very rich.
I mean, they're accustomed to havin' things just so.
That's not exactly the problem.
The wage is very low.
No, the Biddles are generous enough.
Long hours, then?
I wouldn't say so.
There's a gorgeous sight.
Are you getting ready for a party?
No, Mr. Biddle's on a chocolate-cake diet.
I beg your pardon?
Cordelia!
He says it's the perfect food, containing every essential element.
Where is Mrs. Biddle?
She's gone shopping.
Blast!
And Cordy?
- I couldn't say.
- And the boys?
I haven't seen them since lunch.
At a time like this.
No one!
Is there something
I could do, Mr. Biddle?
Yes.
You can call Dr. Donleavy.
Tell him I've been bit by an alligator.
Oh, dear!
Might as well live alone.
Are you a married man?
Me, sir?
No, sir.
Then you wouldn't understand.
? I've been bit on my finger?
? It could have been my leg?
? It could have been my head?
? I might have died?
? In a time of mortal peril?
? Any man should expect?
? That his family will come rushing to his side?
? What's wrong with that??
? What's wrong with that??
? My family rushing to my side?
? What's wrong with that??
Oh, not a thing, sir, I'm sure.
? I'm a good-hearted husband?
? I'm generous and kind?
? No wife could have a life as free of cares?
? So when a good-hearted husband has been bit?
? It's only right?
? That his wife should share the agony he bears?
? What's wrong with that??
? What's wrong with that??
? I want my wife to share my life?
? What's wrong with that??
Cordelia!
Well, now.
Now, that answers a whole slew of questions, don't it?
Cordy!
Boys!
Blast!
? Here in this house
I'm raising?
? Three strong, intelligent children?
? Where are they now in their father's time of need??
? I give them private tutors?
? The finest physical trainers?
? All in vain?
Ohh, the pain!
? I believe in the Bible?
? I believe in Uncle Sam?
? And as sure as Old Glory waves above?
? I believe a man who's bitten has the right to demand?
? That his family give him sympathy and love?
? What's wrong with that??
? What's wrong with that??
? The flag above, the Bible, and love?
? What's wrong with that??
- Hello, Papa.
- Cordy!
Where have you been?
Out in the stable with Tony and Liv.
- Is something wrong?
- Yes, something's wrong.
What were you doing shaving at this time of day?
I haven't been shaving.
And since when do
I shave my finger?
You don't shave your ear either.
- But last week you cut it.
- That's different.
The ear is in the general vicinity of the face.
So's the finger when you're shaving.
It's a bite, blast it!
- No.
- Yes.
- Who?
- George.
Turned on me just like that after all these years.
Well, it's really not such a bad bite.
Is that all you have to say?
There's some antiseptic in the emergency kit.
- And some bandages.
- Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
It's time for Bible class.
Yes, I know.
But you'll have to do without me today.
I have an engagement.
Dr. Donleavy's somewhere between his office and the hospital.
Keep trying.
Oh, what are you doing?
Me, sir?
Not a thing, sir.
- Well, do something.
- Yes, sir.
Blasted alligator.
- I beg your pardon.
- Treated him like a son.
What exactly would you like me to do?
Tell the boys to bring in that emergency kit.
Out the back door, across the yard to the stable.
Mr. Tony.
Mr. Livingston.
Mr. Tony and Mr. Livingston.
Blasted Benedict Arnold.
That's what he is.
Yes?
Would you tell Miss Biddle
Mr. Taylor is calling?
- Mr. Who?
- Mr. Charles Taylor.
Miss Biddle is expecting me.
Cordy!
Dr. Donleavy must have stopped to make a house call.
I could be dying.
Indeed you could.
Where's that blasted antiseptic?
Here you are, Pa.
- It's about time.
- We came as soon as we heard.
I left word with the doctor to call.
What happened, Pa?
Was it really George?
Gentle old George?
Yes, it was gentle old George.
Hey, Pa, what's
Charlie Taylor doing here?
He came to see Cordy.
The answer to a maiden's prayer.
What do you know about maidens' prayers?
Nothing, Pa.
It's just an expression.
Oh.
But Charlie Taylor?
- Cordy can do better than that.
- I'm sure she can.
When the time comes.
That's pretty good.
Going into vaudeville?
Hi, Tony.
Long time, no see.
- This is my brother, Liv.
- Hiya, sport.
Hi.
- Say, that man in the hall.
- Yeah?
That wasn't your father, was it?
- Who did you think it was?
- I thought he was some kind...
Uh, uh, uh.
Hey, caramel!
They're for Cordy, sport.
Cordy hates caramels.
They stick in her retainer.
But I like caramel.
So does Tony.
Don't you, sport?
Oh, love 'em.
Okay, fellas, that's enough.
Charlie! You've been hiding your light under a bushel.
Liv, you should feel that.
Hey! What weight do you fight at, Charlie?
- Fight?
- Boxing.
You do box, don't you?
I prefer other sports.
You don't do it at all?
No.
Liv, he doesn't do it at all.
Aw, Charlie.
You're in trouble.
I don't understand.
Well, if you've got your eye on Cordy...
? Remember Harry Applegate??
? Yeah, he took
Cordy on a date?
? Oh, what a dapper Dan?
? Pearly teeth and tennis tan?
Remember him well.
? Thought he was a Romeo?
? Tried to kiss our sis, and, oh!?
? Harry ducked, but too late?
? Father bought him an upper plate?
? Watch your footwork?
? Better learn to bob and weave?
? Sister Cordy's got dynamite up her sleeve?
? What a jab?
? Dynamite up her sleeve?
? What a hook?
? Dynamite up her sleeve?
? Keep your guard up?
Charlie, never lead it with your right.
You'll get killed that way.
Look, fellas, let's forget the whole thing.
I didn't come here to do this.
? Archie Baxter came here twice?
? First time out, he acted nice?
? Romance was in the air?
? Oh, they made a lovely pair?
Beautiful.
? Second date, it was a dance?
? He grabbed her tight, this was his chance?
? Cordy only bruised that sport?
? Father settled it out of court?
So...
? Watch your footwork?
? Better learn to bob and weave?
? Sister Cordy's got dynamite up her sleeve?
? What a fake?
? Dynamite up her sleeve?
? What an uppercut?
? Dynamite up her sleeve?
Uh-oh.
- Charlie.
- Charlie?
- Hey, Charlie, wake up.
- Are you hurt?
Tony? Livingston?
Come on, it's time for Bible class.
What happened?
He dropped his left.
Oh.
You better get some ice.
And get some beefsteak.
Charlie?
Charlie!
Well, don't you look pretty!
Papa, how could you?
How could I what?
It's no wonder
I never have any callers.
- Oh, now, wait a minute.
- People are afraid to come here.
I didn't hurt the young sap.
Sap?
Charlie Taylor's only the most popular boy in town.
Oh, here he comes.
Charlie, are you all right?
Sure, he's all right.
Come on, Charlie.
- Thataboy.
- I'm so sorry, Charlie.
There's no serious damage.
He'll have a black eye for a couple of days.
- Ooh!
- Can I get you something?
I sent for some raw meat.
How about a cold drink, Charlie?
Oh!
Oh, thank you.
Charlie, why don't you sit in this comfortable chair?
And I'll see if
I can get you some iced tea.
Or would you like a piece of chocolate cake?
Charlie!
Gee, we're sorry.
We didn't mean to do it.
We told him to keep his guard up.
You see, Cordy, I had nothing to do with it.
Didn't you?
Like father, like son.
You're all three the same.
Always having your sport no matter what.
Always ready for a fight.
Oh, Cordy, we didn't...
Don't touch me.
I'll flatten you!
Cordy.
Cordy, wait.
Blast it!
? Oh,
Miss Cordelia Drexel Biddle?
? I thought I knew you well?
? But now,
Miss Cordelia Drexel Biddle?
? I just can't tell?
? Are you valentine candy or bo xing gloves??
? Lately you seem very strange?
? What in the world's coming over you??
? Everything's starting to change?
? Are you sonnets by Shelley or Rover Boys??
? Once any answer would do?
? Why are you suddenly wondering?
? Which kind of someone are you??
? Is a boy meant to spar with or gaze at a star with??
? Should you kiss him or blacken his eye??
? Now, if he buys you roses?
? A right to the nose is really not quite the proper reply?
? You're so lost in the middle of in-between?
? Is your destiny canvas or crepe de Chine??
? Will you someday be someone that somebody loves??
? Are you valentine candy or...?
? Bo xing gloves??
Mrs. Worth,
I'm not a one to pry, but I can't help wondering some things.
Yes, Mr. Lawless?
? Board by board?
Is it forever like this?
Like what?
Ha, that must be
Dr. Donleavy at last.
? Body and mind of mortal man?
It isn't as if this was the only job in Philadelphia.
Well, not for a likable lad like meself.
? Fashion the framework board by board?
Mrs. Worth?
I've decided to run along for now.
Perhaps I can call another day.
Perhaps.
Who are you?
John Lawless.
A professional pugilist, no doubt.
Ma'am?
Did you come here to fight?
Oh, no, ma'am, I came about the butler's position.
Then announce me.
And take off your hat in the house.
? Strengthen the dwelling of the Lord?
? Fashion the framework board by board?
? Here in his image now we stand?
? Building his fortress strong and grand?
? It is written that the?
? Body and mind of mortal man?
? Should walk in the spirit of his master plan?
Mr. Biddle?
There's a lady in the music room.
A lady?
She didn't give a name.
Like there was no need.
Aunt Mary.
Tell her there's nobody at home.
But, sir...
? It is written that the?
? Body and mind of mortal man?
? Should walk in the spirit of his master plan?
? So we must strengthen the dwelling of the Lord?
I'm afraid there's no one here, ma'am.
No one here?
No one at all save
Mrs. Worth and meself.
And as for me, I...
? It is written that the body and mind of mortal man?
? Should walk in the spirit of his master plan?
Aunt Mary!
What a nice surprise.
Is it?
I come about the butler's position.
Oh, good!
Then take these, would you?
And tell Mr. Biddle that Aunt Mary is here.
And bring us some tea into the parlor, please.
If the stores get any more crowded,
I'm just going to have to give up shopping entirely.
You can't imagine the swarms of people.
Do sit down, Aunt Mary.
This is not a social call.
I've come for a specific reason.
In today's paper, in George Gray's gossip column, it is reported... that "last week,
Cordelia Drexel Biddle entered a one-step contest in Atlantic City with a Heinie Fenstermaker," whoever that is.
I don't recognize the name.
"And won."
We, uh...
We were in Atlantic City for the Bible-class convention.
I know why you were in Atlantic City, but that does not explain and certainly doesn't excuse the matter at hand.
Well, good afternoon, Aunt Mary.
Always a pleasure to see you.
Cordelia.
Anthony.
Oh, Anthony, your finger.
Yes.
George bit me.
George?
I can't imagine what got into him.
Quite obviously your finger got into him.
Anyone who keeps an alligator in the house must expect to be bit and deserves it.
Well, I'm sure George was only playing and forgot himself.
Do you really think so?
Oh, I'm sure of it.
Over there, please.
He probably feels as badly about it as you do.
I wonder.
That will be all, thank you.
You're right, Cordelia.
He wants to make up.
- Well...
- Ha.
If the jungle theatrics are quite over,
I should like to return to the subject of my visit, which is Cordy.
What about Cordy?
I do not consider she's under the right influences for a young woman in her social position.
She's under my influence and her mother's and her brothers'.
Oh, please, Anthony, don't pretend naiveté.
You know perfectly well what I mean.
No, I don't.
I do not know what you mean.
Did you read this morning's paper?
Yes.
Yes, I did.
German U-boats in our waters sinking British merchant ships in sight of Nantucket.
That's what they think of our neutrality.
Did you get beyond the first page?
George Gray's column, dear.
Cream or lemon, Aunt Mary?
Of course not.
Blasted professional troublemaker.
Oh, no, he doesn't make trouble.
He reports it.
This Mr. Fenstermaker.
He's a member of one of your Bible classes, I assume?
Yes.
Yes, he is.
And a fine, upstanding young man he is, too.
Anthony, tell me something.
Were the children in school at all last year?
They were being tutored,
Aunt Mary.
And who's tutoring the tutor?
What do you mean?
Well, everybody knows that you hired this man as a boxing coach.
Can't even sign his own name.
Tony and Liv got into St. Paul's all right.
They're going next week.
And I applaud the move.
Now let's do the same for Cordy.
The Laleta Wingfield School for Young Ladies in Lakewood, New Jersey, is accepting applications.
Oh, no, you don't.
I won't have Cordy exiled to some prison.
Anthony, answer me.
What proper young man in his right mind would want to marry a lady prizefighter?
Blast the proper young man.
That's easy to say.
Besides, what's this talk about marriage?
Cordy's a child.
You're blind, Anthony, in more ways than one.
- Blind or not, I'm not...
- Papa.
Oh, Cordy.
- We were just discussing you.
- Yes, I know.
And, Papa, I'd like to go off to school.
Hello, Aunt Mary.
Good afternoon, Cordelia.
Hello, Mama.
Darling.
Cordy.
Did I hear you correctly?
I'm sure you did, Papa.
Are you still upset about what happened a while ago?
Do you want that boy back over here?
I'll drag him back.
No, Papa.
It isn't Charlie Taylor.
Well, then, what is it?
Don't you like it here?
Of course I like it here.
Don't we have a good time?
Yes.
But it's hard to explain, Papa.
I'm not like the other girls.
Well, hooray for that.
Look at the other girls.
Oh, Papa.
Cordy,
I like you the way you are.
You're pretty.
You have fun.
You're alive.
You've got a better left hook than Tony or Liv.
But I don't want a left hook.
Anthony, I think we'd better talk about this later.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
I do know what I'm saying.
I want to go to
Miss Wingfield's school.
All right.
All right.
You go.
Go to prison if you want to.
Thank you, Papa.
Blast!
Ooh!
Well, it's late.
And I've other things to do.
Well, thank you for coming, Aunt Mary.
I don't like to interfere.
But attention must be paid to these matters.
I know.
Good day, Cordelia.
Good day, Anthony.
Anthony.
We do have to let Cordy go.
She's not a child anymore.
And it's selfish to keep her here in this special world.
What's wrong with this special world?
Oh, Anthony, why do you have to take everything so personally?
Is there some other way?
You might as well put out that terrible weed.
You won't get rid of me that way.
Anthony.
I raised very few objections to the way that Cordy's been brought up, despite its being rather unorthodox.
Don't say, "What's wrong with being unorthodox?"
There's nothing wrong with it.
If I didn't feel that way,
I couldn't have stayed married to you all these years.
It's been a good life.
A healthy life.
And Cordy's been happy.
But now she's older and feels a need to reach out.
But she won't like it.
That's for her to decide.
You didn't want to let go of Tony and Liv.
You fought St. Paul's like a tiger.
Well, now it's Cordy.
Blast it, Cordelia.
I said she could go, didn't I?
Yes, dear.
Well, then... what's all the fuss about?
I'm going out to the gym.
Good idea.
You'll feel much better when you get back.
Oh.
Mrs. Biddle.
Mrs. Biddle, if it's convenient...
Oh, yes. I'm afraid
I don't remember your name.
John Lawless, ma'am.
The Mayflower Employment Agency.
Ah, fine.
Dinner's at 7:00, John.
Well?
Were you put on?
"Dinner's at 7:00," she says.
Heaven help me.
Good way to let off steam.
Papa, I'm sorry for the way I acted.
I appreciate your apology.
I do love my home.
I don't really want to go away.
Well, you were right wanting to go.
You're not a child any longer.
It's selfish to try to keep you here in this special world.
What's wrong with this special world?
Now, don't you start that.
Cordy.
You have to make your own life in your own way.
You can't stay here with your mother and me forever.
Of course, when you come home on vacations, things will be just the same.
All of a sudden, I'm afraid.
Now, that I won't have.
There's nothing out there to be afraid of, as long as you keep your guard up and your chin tucked, and know how to bring one up from the floor.
Oh, Papa.
When I was a little girl,
I used to think you must be the most wonderful person in the whole world.
Now that I'm older and much wiser, I know you are.
Well, come on, let's go back in the house.
If you don't like that school, you don't have to stay up there.
? Dee-a da da da?
? Dee-a ta ta ta-ta ta?
? Da-da ta-ta tee?
Mr. Biddle?
Mr. Bid...
What's wrong?
You're white as a sheet.
Faith, you do have an alligator!
12 of them.
What's wrong with that?
Not a thing.
It's relieved, I am.
I captured them myself down in Florida.
Went into the swamp with a party of Seminoles.
Have you ever seen a Seminole
Indian capture alligators?
I can't say I have.
Well, they can paddle a canoe so you can't hear it two feet away.
If the animals don't show themselves, you give them the mating call.
Say, who are you, anyway?
John Lawless, sir.
I'll be the new butler.
Oh, we've got a new butler.
No, Papa.
He quit.
Already?
- Days ago.
- Oh.
Well, if you'll excuse me, sir.
John Lawless, is it?
That's right, sir.
Tell me, John.
Are you a religious man?
I try to live by the Good Book.
How well do you succeed?
- I'm not sure.
- Never mind.
We'll go into that another time.
What do you think of boxing?
- Boxing?
- Why don't we find Mother...
Not in self-defense.
Ever done any of that?
Well, at the fair last year in County Tyrone,
I was fisticuffs champion.
Is that so?
Champion?
Well, it isn't a very large county, sir.
Fisticuffs champion of where was that again?
County Tyrone.
It's in Ireland.
Ah. You going to become an American citizen, John?
- Well, I intend to apply, sir.
- You'll never regret it.
- Greatest country in the world.
- Papa!
There's certain things
I believe in, John.
God and the United States are at the top of the list.
I know very well what the United States has to offer.
That's how it is I'm here.
Yes, well, like I say...
There's something else
I know just as well.
And that is you are what you are, and that's good, too.
I beg your pardon?
Well, being an American is addin' something.
It isn't subtracting.
On the night before I sailed away, they come from far and near.
? All me friends and all me kin?
? To shed a partin' tear?
? We knew we'd never meet again?
? And yet was clear to see?
? I'd always be a part of them?
? And them a part of me?
? I'll always be Irish?
? 'Cause that's how I began?
? I'll always be Irish,
I'll say that to any man?
? And when I'm an American,
I'll be a good one, too?
? I'll be truly as American as Irish stew?
Hey, that's pretty good.
? He'll be truly as American as Irish stew?
Ask for Irish stew in Ireland and see what you get.
I never thought of that.
In Ireland, all the stew is Irish.
? I'll always be Irish?
? A fact I'll not deny?
? I'll always be Irish, and I'll hold me head up high?
? I'll wear the green
St. Patty's Day?
? And yet for all of that?
? I'll be truly as American as "Casey at the Bat"?
? He'll be truly as American as "Casey at the Bat"?
Say, that looks like good exercise.
Come on, Cordy.
- Hey!
- Papa!
If you can win a one-step contest, you ought to be able to do this.
I thought you didn't like dancing.
It's that waltzing business
I don't like.
Ha.
That's for old folks.
Hey!
Huh! Ha!
? If I went to Paris for the rest of me days?
? And ate bread and cheese in sidewalk cafés?
? Lived in a garret, wore a beret?
-? What would I be??
- An Irishman!
? If I went to Tibet and bought me a yak?
? And traveled Siberia ridin' his back?
? The peasants would point at me, what would they say??
Irishman?
- Right!
- Right!
? But if I went to Spain and grew a moustache?
? Strummed the guitar and wore me a sash?
? Became a toreador and fought me a bull?
- ndele!
- Ndele!
- Hooray!
- Yippee!
After they awarded me both ears and the tail, what would they say?
- Olé!
- Olé!
- For the Irishman!
- Right!
Hey-ho!
Whoo-aaa-hoo!
Come on, Mrs. Worth.
Come on, now.
Whoo! Ha!
It's good for you.
Ha ha!
Ah, thatagirl!
You should have seen me father doin' this.
Like a tornado across the floor.
Hey!
Oh!
Ohhhh!
Ohh! Oh!
? He'll always be Irish?
Ah, shout it good and loud!
? He'll always be Irish?
? Of his heritage, he's proud?
? I'm proud of Irish blarney?
? And Irish sentiment?
? And I'll bet someday we get an Irish president?
? And I'll bet someday we get an Irish president?
Whee-ha!
Hey, let me in there.
Hey-ya diddle!
Hey-ya!
Ha!
Beautiful!
Whee!
Whee! Hoo!
- Ha!
- Whoo!
Hey!
Whoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
Oh, the Mayflower
Employment Agency.
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
Hey!
Yes.
I think Mr. Lawless will suit our needs very well.
Hee!
Come on,
I want George to see this.
Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!
Cordelia, whatever are you laughing at?
Papa.
He's now giving military training to the Bible classes.
They're marching up and down in front of the house.
Broomsticks for rifles.
Cordelia, what an absolutely gorgeous invitation!
Whoever is it from?
Well, read it for yourself if you're so anxious.
I'm not the least bit anxious.
I was only trying to be sociable.
Cordelia!
The William Thaws are absolutely world-famous for their parties.
However did you get this invitation?
Well, I'm in great demand socially.
Didn't you know?
I suppose you give boxing exhibitions.
However did you guess?
And I think I'll get in some practice.
Right now!
I'll call Miss Wingfield!
With that rouge all over your face?
Cordy.
You wouldn't tell Miss Wingfield that I wear rouge to bed, will you?
No matter how angry you get?
Well...
Oh, no, you wouldn't be so cruel.
Rosemary?
Hmm?
Would you teach me how to flirt?
Pardon?
Well, my Aunt Gladys said there were gonna be all sorts of young men at the dance from Yale and Princeton.
Your Aunt Gladys.
So that's how you got invited.
The William Thaws are my aunt and uncle.
Since I'm going to school here in Lakewood, they're practically duty-bound.
I should have guessed.
Well, it helps to be related to almost everybody.
I want to make the most of it.
Will you help me, Rosemary?
Cordelia, if you're suggesting that I know anything about...
Oh, come on, Rosemary.
I'll bet you're the world's champion.
Well, the fact that
I have been admired by men doesn't make me a flirt.
Rosemary.
Hmm?
Would you like me to swear that I'll never tell
Miss Wingfield about the rouge?
That's blackmail.
It's a trade.
Well?
I wonder if those Thaw parties are as absolutely spectacular as people say.
That's how trading works, isn't it?
All right.
I'll ask my Aunt Gladys.
Oh, good!
Come here.
Now, if a girl wants to be popular nowadays, there's one thing that she absolutely needs to know.
What?
Bye-yum pum pum.
Bye-yum pum pum?
? Bye-yum pum pum?
? Bye-yum pum pum?
? Bye-yum pum pum, bye-yum?
? You must be?
? Oh, so misterioso?
? Enthusiasm is très passé?
? You must slink across the floor?
? As if it's a dreadful bore?
? To the rhythm of bye-yum pum pum?
? Bye-yum pum pum?
? Bye-yum pum pum, bye-yum?
? Nita Naldi, Theda Bara?
? Hollow cheeks and black mascara?
? Bye-yum pum pum, bye-yum?
Okay, what's next?
? The men in college?
? Always acknowledge?
? A girl who dances in a trance?
? So bye-yum until the dawn as if you're about to yawn?
? To the rhythm of?
? Bye-yum pum pum?
? Bye-yum pum pum?
Attitude, Cordy!
? Bye-yum pum pum, bye-yum?
? Today the key to being wanted?
? Is just to glide as if you're hunted?
? And your right foot, left foot, right, back?
Let me try, let me try!
Right foot, left foot, right, back together.
Now arms, Cordy, arms.
Use your arms, back together.
And slink, two, three.
Bye-yum and slink, two, three.
Bye-yum and slink, two.
Now spin like a top.
That's it!
Cordy, you're absolutely wicked.
I love it.
How exotic.
Bravo.
Nita Naldi!
Theda Bara!
Cordy, you're absolutely dangerous.
And scandalous!
? For when you're oh, so misterioso?
? The men will grow so entranced with you?
Shocking!
? As you secretly conceal the tingly way you feel?
? When you're dancing to?
? Bye-yum pum pum?
? Bye-yum pum pum?
? Bye-yum pum pum, bye-yum?
Cordelia!
Oh!
Aunt Gladys.
Cordelia, darling.
Aunt Gladys.
I've been looking all over for you.
Where have you been?
I want you to meet the two most charming young men at the party.
My niece,
Cordelia Drexel Biddle.
Mr. Roger Fitzsimmons and Mr. Walter Blakely.
Both just down from New Haven.
- How do you do?
- A pleasure.
Well, I'll leave you three to get acquainted.
Young people today don't need anything more than an introduction.
Snappy party.
What?
Oh.
Oh, yes.
Very snappy.
Have a gasper?
A what?
Oh.
No, thank you.
I didn't think you were the type.
These days, you can't tell.
Smoking shortens your wind.
Well, that's why athletes never smoke.
Say, there's a friend of my family
I ought to go over and speak to.
Can't it wait until later, Roger?
I wouldn't want to miss her.
My mother would never forgive me.
Miss Biddle.
Yoo-hoo.
Cordelia.
Absolutely heavenly party.
Yes. Heavenly.
So many attractive men.
Who is that?
My roommate.
We're playing Harvard next week.
Who is?
Yale.
Oh.
Mr. Blakely.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I promised this dance.
You did?
Yes.
The first one-step.
I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no.
No, of course not.
Why don't you ask Rosemary?
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
- Tell her I suggested it.
Well, when your partner comes.
Oh, but you needn't wait around.
He'll be here any second.
Who is he?
I can keep an eye out for him.
Oh, I don't think you know him.
What's his name?
His name?
Well, it's...
Angier Duke.
This is our dance, isn't it?
The first one-step?
Yes.
Mr. Duke, Mr. Blakely.
You can't keep her to yourself all evening, Mr. Blakely.
No, I guess not.
Miss Biddle.
He's probably a nice enough fellow when you get to know him.
Shall we have our dance?
Mr. Duke, why did you do that?
Because I thought
I'd like to know you.
Worked out real well, didn't it?
Why do you want to know me?
Because you're not like the other girls.
I mean that in the nicest way.
I don't like these pushy girls who think they can trap any man with a big act.
But you saw me practicing.
Didn't it scare you away?
No.
You were so bad at it.
Oh.
It's a waltz.
The waltz is for old people.
Is it?
I warned you.
I'm not a very good dancer.
Oh, nonsense, Mr. Blakely.
You're as light as an elf.
I don't think the waltz is for old people.
I was just saying something somebody told me.
? Are we dancing??
? Are we really here??
? Is this feeling something real?
? Or will it disappear??
? Are we dancing??
? Does the music soar??
? Was this lovely song I hear?
? Ever heard before??
? Are your eyes confessing things?
? I alone can see?
? Or is my imagination?
? Flying away with me??
? Are we dancing??
? Say we really are?
? Then I'll know that I?
? Reached into the sky?
? I reached into the sky?
? And touched a star?
? Is this feeling something real?
? Or will it disappear??
? Was this lovely song I hear?
? Ever heard before??
? Are your eyes confessing things?
? I alone can see?
? Or is my imagination?
? Flying away with me??
? Are we dancing??
? Say we really are?
? Then I'll know that I?
? I'll know that I?
? Reached into the sky?
? Reached to the sky?
? I reached into the sky?
? And touched a star?
It's beautiful, isn't it?
It's more than beautiful.
It's a masterpiece of engineering.
A Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost.
Oh.
Yes, it's very nice.
You know, the chassis of that car is bolted together with special tapered bolts made to fit holes that were reamed by hand.
- Really?
- Yeah.
It's practically sewn together.
Well, I don't know very much about cars.
You don't have to know much to appreciate a Rolls.
If you were just once out on the road in that car.
Say, it's cold out here, isn't it?
Can I get your coat?
My Uncle has a Silver Ghost.
I've driven it.
I've been up to 75 miles an hour.
Smooth as silk.
The suspension system really is remarkable.
May I see you again?
Now you have to.
Pardon me, Cordelia.
My friends,
I'd like to offer a toast.
To our guests of honor.
And to the entire Marine Corps.
The most glorious institution
God ever put on this broad, green Earth.
I recently traveled to Washington to see if anyone there was concerned about this war that's got half the world in flames.
I was treated to a lot of excuses and a lot of speeches.
Until I got to the Marines.
It's going to be a long evening.
When I talked to the Marine commandant about preparedness, he understood.
When I told him there were
5,000 men here in Philadelphia ready and eager to be trained, he was interested.
These three men arrived this morning as proof of his sincerity.
They're going to work with our Philadelphia Corps.
And if war comes, by George, we're going to be ready.
? I believe in this country?
? But our country's unprepared?
? Our defenses aren't worth a hill of beans?
? So when a man loves his country?
? Should he sit back and complain?
? Or call out the United States Marines??
? What's wrong with that??
? What's wrong with that??
? What better way, what better means?
? To take my stand with the Marines??
? What's wrong with that??
To the Marine Corps.
Gentlemen, I want to say again, it's good to have you with us.
Sir, is the Philadelphia Corps the same thing as the Biddle Bible classes?
Well, it grew out of that.
The Bible classes are the hard core.
The core of the Corps.
Yes, you might say that.
Mr. Biddle, you've done a swell job getting all those men together.
I think it's great.
A man like yourself taking such an interest.
A man like myself?
Yes, an older man with plenty of money.
And I promise you, sir, we'll have them snapping to in no time.
Lieutenant, I already have them snapping to.
I expect you to take it from there.
- Will you take seconds?
- No, thank you.
The one thing my men need is formal combat training.
I'm depending on you gentlemen for that.
John, would you please tell Mrs. Worth that I'd like to serve dinner as soon as possible?
Yes, ma'am.
It's trench fighting that's going to win this war.
I want my men to learn how to use a bayonet and the butt of a gun.
We've got a training program set up.
Close combat is a part of it.
A big part, I hope.
It'll save lives.
I know I'm anxious to learn.
It's pretty strenuous exercise,
Mr. Biddle.
Is it, now?
Of course you'll be welcome to observe, sir.
Gentlemen, may I show you around the place?
We'll start with the stables.
This way, gentlemen.
The stables are right out here across the terrace.
Dear, let's not move the entire party outside.
It looks as if Anthony might learn a lesson tonight.
I'm tempted to go out there and watch myself.
Aunt Mary.
You forget that Anthony's boxed with champions.
But they were friends, Cordelia.
And professionals.
These young men are not friends.
And there is nothing so dangerous as the inspired amateur.
Yes, I fixed this place up to provide some healthy fun and relaxation for myself and the rest of the family.
Say, would any of you like to go a round or two before dinner?
How about you Marines?
Do any of you know how to box?
We all know how to box, sir.
- That's part of our training.
- Fine.
John!
You want to box with me, sir?
We'll just go a couple of rounds, Lieutenant.
Thank you.
You know, a lot of older men take up sports of one kind or another just to pass the time.
John!
You yelled, sir?
Yes. Would you keep time for us, John?
Yes, sir.
We box by college rules here,
Lieutenant.
Two-minute rounds.
Thank you, John.
Well, are you ready, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
All right, John.
Time, gentlemen.
The men in the Philadelphia
Corps have a lot to learn about military science.
But you will find them well-disciplined.
And physically fit.
So that's your style, is it?
Bill O'Brien used to lean on his left like that.
Poor Billy never was a really top fighter.
One thing to remember about the Philadelphia Corps.
They're civilians.
You'll get a lot more out of them if you lead them.
Rather than bully them.
Know what I mean?
Oh, Lieutenant!
Well, that was just a lucky punch.
Might just as well have happened to me.
Come on.
Yeah, that was quick thinking catching old Jim Corbett in your lap like that.
John, that's a bad spot for old Jim up there.
I'll bet we've knocked him off that wall at least a dozen times.
You know, Corbett and I sparred in this very ring several times.
He was a great fighter.
Well, who's next?
Well, don't you think we ought to go back, sir?
We wouldn't want to delay dinner, sir.
That's very considerate.
We'll rejoin the ladies, then.
John, would you get some ice for the lieutenant?
- It'll keep the swelling down.
- I'll bring some directly, sir.
As soon as I get Mr. Corbett back up on the wall.
You know, I've worked up a little appetite.
Yes, boxing always helps my appetite.
Greatest sport in the world.
Mr. Biddle?
I've got a proposition.
If you won't tell the men of the Philadelphia Corps that you took the best boxer among us in one round, we'll teach you all the close combat you want, sir.
Fine, fine.
I'm looking forward to it.
Say, gentlemen, before we go in to dinner,
I want to show you my alligators.
? What's wrong with that??
? What's wrong with that??
? What better way, what better means?
? To take your stand with the Marines??
? What's wrong with that??
? What's wrong with that??
Come on.
I'll show you the alligators.
I keep them in the conservatory.
The days of the custom car are numbered.
Even in luxury automobiles, standardization is a practical necessity.
Not only for the manufacturer but for the individual car owner as well.
Take a car like the Marmon.
I'd rather not.
Huh?
Angie, do you think we could talk about something besides automobiles for a change?
World affairs.
Or the weather.
I'm sorry, Cordy.
Or you.
I'd really love to hear about you.
Okay. Me.
What kind of music do you like?
Music?
What's your favorite book?
Let me see.
My favorite book.
Let's talk about your career.
My career?
There's not much to tell.
We're in tobacco.
Do you like tobacco?
As a business, I mean.
I guess so.
You guess so?
I haven't thought that much about it.
It's a family business, and I guess I'll take it over someday.
Is there something you'd rather do?
Yes, but you said you wanted to talk about something else.
Oh, no.
You mean you want to make a career out of automobiles?
? There's a shining city west of here?
? Where dreams are booming into gear?
? It's no humdrum nine-to-five town?
? It's a growing, going, bright, alive town?
? Golden sparks light up the skies there?
? Like a thousand
Fourth of Julys there?
? How I want to stake a claim in?
? Roll up my sleeves and make a name in?
? Detroit?
Detroit?
Michigan.
? You can hear it humming, see it coming?
? Feel it everywhere you go?
? It's tomorrow morning?
? The future dawning?
? With a bright and shining glow?
? It's a land where golden chariots?
? Are molded out of dreams?
? Detroit?
? Detroit?
? Detroit, Detroit?
? It's Detroit?
? Oh, if I could be there,
I'd be free there?
? Standing on my own two feet?
? I'd invent new motors, design new rotors?
? I'd be in the driver's seat?
? I'd make all my dreams realities?
? Oh, I'd be on my way?
? In Detroit?
? Detroit?
? Detroit, Detroit?
? In Detroit?
? Others are giving their dreams a try?
? If others can dream there?
? Why can't I??
Cordy, you'd be amazed at the things they're doing out there.
They're working on a two-range transmission.
Four-wheel brakes.
Do you think they could do something about the seats?
Sure.
That's easy.
And heat the inside?
Why not? There's hot water in the radiator.
How about a gramophone so we could have music on long trips?
Sure.
It's possible.
And any color you want?
I don't know about that.
Okay.
Any color you want.
? So you see where the rainbow ends for me?
? Is known to the world as F. O.B.?
? Detroit?
What is it?
I don't know.
I'll find out.
Cordy.
You think I'm crazy?
About Detroit, I mean.
Boy, my mother does.
? If you hear it humming, see it coming?
? That's the place where you must go?
? But to make your name there?
? You must stake your claim there?
? And let no one tell you no?
Then you don't think I'm crazy.
? Then my dreams of golden chariots?
? In Detroit can all come true?
? For you hear it humming?
? And you see it coming?
? And you?
? Want to be there, too?
Hurry!
Well, those men looked good tonight.
Yes, sir.
Like seasoned troopers.
Don't you think they looked good?
Yes, dear.
They looked cold, too.
I was sorry for them.
They're going to have to fight battles in cold weather.
I wasn't criticizing, dear.
It was a lovely parade.
- It's cold in here.
- Yes, it is.
Yeah, I think the furnace must be off.
No.
The radiator's hot.
Yeah, there's a terrible draft coming from somewhere.
The conservatory, I think.
The conservatory?
John!
My alligators.
Look at my alligators.
John!
George.
John!
Yes, sir?
You yelled, sir?
What's happened here?
Why are these windows open?
It must have been the new maid, sir.
What new maid?
Her name is Florence, dear.
She started this afternoon.
She was complaining about the smell.
- What smell?
- The alligators.
- They do have a certain...
- What?
We're accustomed to it, dear.
Oh.
She probably decided to give the room an airing... and forgot to close up again.
Well, of all the blasted, stupid...
Get an ax.
Anthony!
Not for Florence.
For the alligators.
Maybe they're still alive.
We'll chop 'em out.
An ax! Move!
Dead, dead, dead.
Get some more towels, John.
Yes, ma'am.
Anthony, it's after midnight.
Yeah.
I hate to give up.
I know, dear.
But there comes a time.
I'll get it.
Dead, dead, dead.
Hello?
Yes, this is Mr. Biddle.
Who's calling?
Oh, yes.
How long ago?
What have you done about it?
Have you called the police?
- Then call them, blast it!
- What is it, Anthony?
I want that blasted town turned upside down, do you hear?
All right.
Call me back the minute you know anything.
- Is it Cordy?
- Yes.
- She's missing.
- Missing?
Three hours past curfew, and nobody there has any idea where she is.
That's a fine way to run a prison.
You don't suppose she's been kidnapped?
- For heaven's sake.
- Well, it happens.
Operator!
- Don't do anything foolish.
- Foolish?
Our daughter is heaven knows where.
- Operator!
- Hello.
Cordy.
Mother.
Cordy.
Papa.
Are you all right?
Of course I'm all right.
You're not hurt in any way?
What are you talking about?
We just had a call from Miss Wingfield.
Oh.
I was hoping we'd get here before that happened.
The weather held us up.
Us?
Is someone with you, Cordy?
Yes.
My fiancé.
Your...
Your what?
His name is Angier Buchanan Duke.
He's in the car.
Do you mean to tell me that some boy is sitting in front of this house thinking he's going to marry you?
Anthony, please.
He wanted to make sure
I got in all right.
I'll tell him he can go now.
Good night!
Good night?
Aren't you going to ask him in?
No, Mother, I don't think so.
I'll call you in the morning!
We don't even get a chance to see him?
Of course you'll see him.
When you're ready.
I'm ready now.
No, Papa.
I'm not gonna let you at him.
Not until you get used to the idea.
Where did you meet this young man, Cordy?
At a party Aunt Gladys and Uncle Bill gave.
I wrote you about it.
You didn't write us about getting engaged.
He didn't ask me until today.
What took him so long?
Oh, now, Anthony.
Papa.
I think you'll really like him very much if you just give him a chance.
Of course we'll give him a chance.
Is I dreaming, I am?
Hello, John.
Oh, you look fine.
Because I'm happy.
I'm engaged!
Engaged, is it?
Well, isn't that grand?
I'm very happy for you.
Isn't that wonderful news,
Mrs. Biddle?
Isn't it just...
I'd best be getting these towels into the parlor.
Towels?
We had a sort of accident this evening.
But I think we should all go up to bed now and talk in the morning.
I am tired.
We got stuck in the snow twice.
And we thought we'd broken the axle.
And then the fan belt came off.
But it was fun.
Good night, Mother.
Good night, darling.
It's so nice to be home.
I love you, Papa.
Good night.
Good night.
"My fiancé," she says.
Without batting an eye.
And you just stand there.
And I just stand there.
What else could we do?
We've never met the young man.
We don't know anything about him.
What's that got to do with it?
She's a child.
She's a young woman.
You can't hold back the clocks, Anthony.
Cordelia, I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm not trying to hold back any clocks.
She's not ready for marriage.
You're not ready.
I'm not going to sit still for it.
Anthony, you'll be making the greatest mistake of your life if you try to stop this engagement.
Is it wrong for me to try to protect my daughter?
Cordy has a mind of her own.
Faced with an obstacle, she will proceed with still greater determination.
Why, you, of all people, ought to know that.
We don't want to push her into an elopement.
Come on.
You know, I'm anxious to see what he looks like.
I believe you're enjoying this.
Well, in a way, I am.
It's a very exciting time.
Cordelia, sometimes you amaze me.
Well, I hope so, Anthony.
It never rains but it pours.
To lose your only daughter and your pet alligators all on the same black night.
What's all the...
Oh!
Anthony, what are you doing down there?
The girl's crazy.
That stuff she uses to color her hair must have gone to her brain.
Miss, would you mind telling me what...
What's going on?
Well...
Well, I'll be.
Anthony, what is it?
Everything's all right now.
That nitwit girl frighten you?
They're not dead!
John!
John!
Yes, sir?
John, they're not dead!
Yes, sir.
I know, sir.
Come on, George.
George!
Cordelia, it's George.
What is it, Papa?
They're not dead.
George.
George, come back here.
Allow me, sir.
George!
George, not outside.
You'll freeze all over again.
Here you are, Mother.
All right.
Out of there.
Run along now.
In the conservatory.
Ah-ah.
Thank you.
Come on.
You heard what Mother said.
Into the conservatory.
George?
Did George come back in here again?
I didn't see him, dear.
Take a look in the dining room, John.
Where do you suppose he got to?
There's breakfast to get on the table, in case you forgot.
How can you be so calm with those monsters on the loose?
They know better than to get in my way.
You can fill the cream pitcher and get busy settin' the table.
Idiot girl.
None of them stay very long.
I'll teach you to make yourself at home in my kitchen!
Come out, I say!
Me new broom.
You drop that!
Drop it, I say!
Where you going, you beast?
You'd be a handbag if I had my way.
You should've let out a call.
I'd have given you a hand.
Thank you, Mr. Lawless.
It wasn't necessary.
I managed very well on me own.
Breakfast will be in half an hour.
I have to slice some more bacon.
Thank you, Mrs. Worth.
Well, I think we'd better get dressed.
That girl may come back here with the police.
Cordy.
Yes, Papa?
Cordy, I've been thinking things over.
I realize
I acted badly last night.
I want you to invite your young man to dinner so I can, as you say, give him a chance.
Thank you, Papa.
Well, you know, I worked up quite an appetite.
I think I'd rather have scrapple than bacon.
Mrs. Worth.
Thank you, Mother.
What for, darling?
For helping Papa change his mind.
Did I do that?
Are you sure?
Oh!
There's an old Irish proverb.
To have your alligators thawed out and your daughter forgive you all on the same bright day, that's fortuosity.
- John?
- Sir?
Who are you talking to?
No one, sir.
You know what they say about people who talk to themselves.
It's like I said.
It's another case of...
? Fortuosity?
? That's me byword?
? Fortuosity means?
George?
George?
? Round the corner?
Ha ha!
George?
George?
I've had about as much as I can stand, now, George!
George!
In the tank.
Will you get in the tank when I tell you?
Right.
George!
George.
Will you come back here?
Come on.
Oh, did I frighten you, then?
Hey, George.
George!
Not in the music room.
Get in...
George.
Come on, George.
Up.
Hey!
That's a good lad.
There you go.
Come on, boy.
This way, lad.
That's a good lad.
There you go.
It's like I said.
? Every bit of life is lit by fortuosity?
? And that's me byword?
? Every bit of life is lit by?
? Twinkle-in-the-eye word?
? Every bit of life is lit?
? By fortuosity?
Aah!
John!
Coming, sir.
George.
Yes, it can only be a matter of weeks now.
Even the White House admits we can't stay out of this war.
I tried to enlist.
Do you know what they told me?
"You're too old."
Me, in the prime of life.
Fit as a fiddle.
"Too old."
No more wine, Mr. Duke?
No thank you, Mr. Biddle.
I still have a full glass.
Don't you like the wine?
We have others.
A cellarful.
No, thank you. No.
I don't drink very much.
It goes right to my head.
That's where it's supposed to go.
So you live in New York,
Mr. Duke.
Yes, ma'am. I do.
Do you like it?
Well, yes.
I guess so.
I never could stand the place, myself.
- How about your work?
- Sir?
Do you enjoy working?
Well, no.
Not really.
- To tell you the truth...
- I don't blame you.
Offices are deadly places.
They confine a man.
Spiritually and physically.
What do you do to escape?
Escape, sir?
Yes.
Do you go in for sports?
Well, I have a boat.
A boat?
A yacht, Papa.
Oh.
A yacht.
Well, I suppose a man can get a kick out of a yacht.
Do you?
Do I what, sir?
Get a kick out of your blasted yacht.
Well, I haven't been on it for a while.
I suppose you've been busy getting ready for the war.
Angie's gonna turn his boat over, Papa.
Turn it over.
Well, that's a good thing to do with a boat.
To the Coast Guard, Papa.
Oh.
Mother thought it would be a good idea.
I see.
Tell me, Mr. Duke.
What else do you like?
Besides sailing, I mean.
Hiking? Skiing?
I broke an ankle once skiing.
Did you get back up on those skis and try again?
No, sir.
Well, you should have.
Well, the bone was kind of sticking out.
Oh.
Oh, that's right.
It goes to your head.
Do you do any fishing or hunting?
Or do you box?
No, sir.
I just don't seem to have the time.
You should take the time.
I was a sickly child, Mr. Duke.
Asthma.
Then when I was 10,
I came down with typhoid fever.
"That's it," they said.
"He'll never make it."
But I did make it.
And somehow the fever killed the asthma.
It was like a miracle.
And do you know what I learned at that early age, Mr. Duke?
That life is a precious and wonderful thing.
But you just can't sit there and let it lap around you.
You have to dive into it.
Taste it. Feel it.
You have to use it.
And the more you use, the more you have.
That's the wonder of it.
Would you like some more dessert, Mr. Duke?
No, thank you, Mrs. Biddle.
It's delicious, though.
Is something wrong, Mr. Duke?
Well, lookit there.
Well, it's Lucy.
I'll bet she's been hiding under there all day where it's warm.
John!
John, look what I found.
Are you all right, Mr. Duke?
Yes.
Thank you.
I don't feel well.
I think I'm getting a cold.
Cordy, why don't you take
Mr. Duke into the parlor?
Yes, ma'am?
John, bring some more coffee into the parlor, will you?
You little devil.
Decided to make a holiday of it, did you?
I told you he keeps alligators.
It's not that.
I mean, it's not just that.
Cordy, he scares me to death.
But that's the whole trouble.
You've got to stand up to him.
I think he'd punch me in the nose.
Punch him back.
Or better still, punch him first.
What?
When he comes in here, you've got to talk up to him.
Whatever he says, you dive right in and contradict him.
Even when he's right?
Especially when he's right.
Cordy, I couldn't do that.
Angie, I want him to like you.
And I'm telling you how to go about it.
Are you feeling better,
Mr. Duke?
Yes.
Thank you.
It was a little close in there.
Yes, in this cold weather one has to be so careful.
Going out of doors, coming in.
Cold weather's good for you.
It clears the lungs.
Puts the heart to work.
I like hot weather.
You do?
Yes, sir.
I do.
Well...
Now we know.
Over here, please, John.
Mr. Biddle, I understand you're a real boxing enthusiast.
Well, yes.
Yes, for some years now, I...
I never could see much in it.
As a sport.
I mean, two men just standing there hitting each other.
It doesn't seem to have much subtlety to it.
- It doesn't?
- No, sir.
John, bring in the gloves.
The boxing gloves, sir?
Yes, the boxing gloves.
Anthony, what are you thinking of?
I want to show Mr. Duke some of the subtleties of the sport and correct his false impression.
John and I can box a quick couple of rounds.
Me, Mr. Biddle?
Fightin' you, sir?
In my parlor?
Just a demonstration.
Mr. Duke, would you mind moving that chair out of the way?
The medium gloves, John.
Pardon me, Cordy.
Anthony, I really don't think this is the time or the place.
We don't have to stand on ceremonies with Mr. Duke.
He's practically a member of the family.
- Right, Mr. Duke?
- Right, sir.
As a matter of fact, sir,
I was just wondering.
Why can't I try it?
What's that?
Why can't I fight you?
Without knowing what you're doing?
From what I've seen of the sport, there can't be that much to it.
- Well, Mr. Duke...
- Anthony.
I don't think so.
I thought this was one house where a man could get a fair fight.
John, give Mr. Duke your gloves.
Gladly, sir.
Allow me, Mr. Biddle.
Cordy, can you help me with these?
I don't think you have to go this far.
Please.
Okay.
There.
You keep time, John.
Cordelia, he wants to.
You heard him.
Anthony, I hope you know what you're doing.
I'll be careful with him.
That isn't exactly what I meant.
Are we ready, gentlemen?
Yes.
You ready, Mr. Duke?
- Yes, sir.
- We'll see if we can't show you there's more to boxing than you think there is.
- All right, John.
- Time.
Never take your eye off your opponent, Mr. Duke.
Mr. Duke, boxing is called the art of self-defense for good reason.
That means you're supposed to protect yourself.
Your stomach.
Your chin.
Keep circling, Angie.
Keep circling.
You see, Mr. Duke?
If I'd been throwing hard punches, you'd be in trouble.
Protect yourself.
Keep your chin tucked, Angie.
- My chin what?
- Tucked.
No, just keep it behind your shoulder there so you don't get hurt.
All right, now you throw some punches at me, Mr. Duke.
Never lead with your right,
Mr. Duke.
You're open for a left hook.
See?
Throw another punch.
Now the stomach.
See?
You're not protecting yourself.
Little more subtle than you thought, isn't it?
Hey.
Wait.
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Mr. Duke.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Mr. Duke!
Wait a minute now.
You see, Mr. Duke.
- Angie!
- You ran right into my glove.
Will you need the ice?
He's all right.
Aren't you, Mr. Duke?
Yes, sir.
Sure, I'm okay.
Well, I hope you're not upset with me.
No. If I were upset,
I'd take care of you.
You'd take care of me?
That's right.
Well, now, I find myself wondering about that.
- You do?
- Yes, indeed, I do.
Excuse me, John.
Sir, would you take your boxing stance right here, please?
Angie.
Cordy, would you stand right over here?
Now what?
Papa!
Say, that's a pretty good trick.
Will you be needing the ice, sir?
Anthony, you all right?
Of course I'm all right.
He caught me unawares, that's all.
Would you care to try it again, sir?
Awares?
Confound it, boy.
I've had my share of roughhouse fighting.
Couldn't all this wait for another time?
The coffee's getting quite cold.
Don't worry, Mrs. Biddle.
No one will get hurt.
At least I won't.
What do you want to do?
Wrestle?
It's called jujitsu, sir.
It's a little like wrestling, yes.
Angie, please.
Have you gone crazy?
Yes, I think I have, Cordy.
And I feel right at home.
Mr. Duke, are you all right?
Is he all right?
I hope I didn't hurt you, sir.
Nothing that won't wear off.
That's a grand style of fighting, sir.
I'd like to learn it meself.
I got a feeling it might come in handy someday.
We've all got to learn it.
Every last man in the Philadelphia Corps.
Mr. Duke, I want to thank you.
That's a remarkable thing.
It could mean the difference between life and death in hand-to-hand combat.
You will teach it to me, won't you?
Yes, of course, sir.
And then, one of these days, we'll have a return match.
Well, Cordelia, these two young people haven't been alone all evening.
Yes, well, it's time to say good night.
It's been so nice having you,
Mr. Duke.
- May I call you Angie?
- Please.
Well, then, good night, Angie.
And we'll see you very soon.
Good night, dear.
- Good night, Mr. Duke.
- Good night, sir.
- Jujitsu, is it?
- Yes, sir.
By George, it's remarkable.
Good night, Cordy.
Papa.
Papa.
Thank you.
Thank me for what?
He could've killed me.
Can we announce our engagement soon?
- Yes, of course.
- Why not?
And can I go to New York and meet Angie's family?
Definitely.
The Biddles and the Dukes will have to get to know each other.
The sooner, the better.
Angier!
Angier, you sly boy.
Whatever have you gone and done?
Mother, I'd like you to meet Cordelia.
So this is the girl.
The one you have picked out of all the world to be yours alone.
My goodness.
Why, I nearly fainted when I got your call.
Engaged.
Imagine that.
And to a girl from Philadelphia.
We're going to have a busy schedule.
Mother, I hope you haven't told people.
- Cordy and I thought...
- Only a select few.
Come along, Cordelia, dear.
Everyone who knows is frantic to entertain you.
Lorraine Mansfield called three times.
Angie.
I thought you'd never come.
I know. I got stuck with my cousin Margaret.
I'm freezing.
I'll fix that.
Angier?
Are you out here?
Oh, so you are.
Behind a bush.
We came out for a little fresh air, Mother.
The last thing we need, Angier, is for you to come down with a cold.
We'll be right in, Mother.
Well, I'd appreciate it.
People are asking for you.
Excuse me.
Papa!
Cordy!
Let me look at you.
You're going to end up a real beauty if you're not careful.
Oh, Papa.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Oh, it's good to see you, sweetheart.
Come over here and sit down.
Now, tell me.
How do you like the big city?
Oh, fine.
There's always something going on.
You get along with the Dukes all right?
Yes, of course.
Perfectly.
Cordy?
Mr. Biddle!
- How are you, son?
- Just fine, sir.
Keeping that jujitsu in good practice?
I've been doing a little practicing myself.
Angier!
Oh, Mother.
Oh.
Mother, may I introduce
Mr. Biddle?
Oh!
Oh, well, this is a happy surprise.
I'm very pleased to meet you, Mrs. Duke.
Is it quite safe?
A beautiful woman has always been safe with me.
I doubt that, Mr. Biddle.
Mrs. Duke, Mrs. Biddle and I are sorry we've had to refuse the kind invitations we've received.
But, well, it seems this war has been taking up all my time.
We've all been disappointed, naturally.
What finally brought you to New York?
- I'm on tour.
- Tour?
With a squad of Marines.
We demonstrate bayonet techniques.
In auditoriums, theaters.
Anywhere we can find the space.
Whatever for?
It's a recruiting device.
Stirs the blood to see these men locked in hand-to-hand combat.
I'm sure it must.
We're just passing through
New York on our way to Boston.
I couldn't resist stopping off between trains to see my little girl.
It's been a treat for all of us.
You'll join our party, of course?
I'm afraid I can't, Mrs. Duke.
I have a 10:00 train to catch.
Well, I'll go with you to the station.
Good, Cordy.
I'd like that.
If you'll excuse her for a while, Mrs. Duke.
But of course.
Excuse me.
I'll get my wrap.
I can get you a cab, sir.
Oh, thank you.
Well, it won't be long now.
The wedding in Philadelphia.
No, no.
It won't be long.
And how do you like it?
They make a handsome couple.
Oh, you don't like it any better than I do.
It takes getting used to.
Wasn't too long ago that Angie wouldn't pick a suit of clothes without asking my opinion.
Now he goes off to Lakewood for a weekend and picks someone to spend the rest of his life with.
Yes.
Well, Mrs. Duke,
I want to thank you for the generous way you've entertained my daughter.
It's my pleasure, Mr. Biddle.
I love spectacle.
Well, I'm not so sure how spectacular you'll find Philadelphia.
But we'll certainly do our best.
I'm sure you will.
Good night.
Good night.
I think I might be coming home next week.
Oh?
But I thought you were going to stay till the end of the month.
Well, I'm awfully tired.
You're sure there's nothing wrong?
Of course I'm sure.
I just want to curl up in my own bed in my own room and stay there for about a week.
They're not like us, Papa.
? When a man has a daughter?
? She's always in his heart?
? Happiness is part of all his prayers?
? When a man has a daughter?
? He wants her life to be?
? As smooth as satin ribbons that she wears?
? What's wrong with that??
? What's wrong with that??
? I want her home, where she's free of care?
? I miss her footsteps on the stairs?
? What's wrong with that??
Mrs. Duke?
Yes?
I found some more people for you to meet.
How delightful.
Gentlemen, this is Cordy's future mother-in-law.
Mrs. Duke, may I present Joe Turner?
Glad to know you, Mrs. Duke.
Joe is one of the mainstays in my Bible classes.
You'd never believe he was a bum and a drunk when I found him.
Mr. Biddle sure saved me, all right.
- He's tops on my list.
- I'm sure.
You're marrying into a fine family.
Yes.
We'll try to be deserving.
And this is Bill O'Brien.
Bill once fought for the heavyweight title.
If I'd have lasted that third round, I'd have got him.
I was just gettin' onto his tricks.
It's really something to fight for the title.
Oh, there's Madame LaFarge.
Finest voice teacher in Philadelphia.
Do you like opera, Mrs. Duke?
Sometimes.
Madame LaFarge sings a mean "Carmen."
Would you excuse me?
Nice party, huh, Mrs. Duke?
Oh, yes.
Colorful.
We can't let New York outclass Philadelphia.
Thanks, John.
Say, I could use another slug of that champagne punch.
How about you, Mrs. Duke?
Oh, no, thank you.
I haven't finished the slug
I already have.
Tell me.
Does Mr. Biddle often present himself in concert?
From time to time, ma'am.
He sang once at a real opera.
Dressed up like a clown, he was.
And sang out loud and clear through the whole thing.
It sounds as though he were appropriately costumed.
Papa did "Pagliacci" with the Manhattan Opera Company.
You're joking.
At least he feels like singing.
Well, so do I sometimes.
But I keep it to myself.
Aren't you having anything to eat?
You might like the sour pickles.
Oh, shut up.
Hi.
You're crying.
You're late.
Is that why you're crying?
No.
I'm crying because...
Oh, I don't know why.
Cordy, there has to be a reason.
Angie.
We're gonna be married in just three days.
I know.
I'm afraid.
Ever since we got engaged,
I never see you alone.
We never talk.
We never touch.
I seem like a total stranger to you, right?
You feel it, too?
Yes, Cordy.
That's why I was late today.
I was so nervous and worried about everything,
I decided to take a walk to clear my mind.
To get things straight.
I walked clear to the Delaware River.
Oh, Angie.
We can't let this happen.
Everything will be all right once we get away from parties and our families and we're on our way to Detroit.
What is it?
- Hold it!
- Cordy.
Just a minute, Mr. Duke.
I'd like another picture.
Later.
Is something wrong?
Cordy, there's something I have to tell you about Detroit.
Yes?
Well, I've been giving it some thought.
And I've come to the conclusion...
Angier!
Where have you been?
I feel like Daniel in the lions' den.
Excuse me.
I shouldn't stay away from my guests too long.
Mother, why do you have to act this way?
Oh, forgive me.
I don't believe it is my behavior that is questionable here.
What about those wedding invitations?
I don't know yet.
And you promised not to mention it.
But we have to know.
Mother, this is a very difficult time for me.
And I wish you'd help me out by going along with the Biddles' way of doing things.
After all, this is their house.
Angier, are you snapping at me?
Why, that's not like you.
Oh, never mind.
We'll help each other.
I promise I will do everything I can to keep the atmosphere peaceful.
Thank you, Mother.
And when we are out of all this madness and you're on your way to the Ozarks...
Mother, I warned you not to talk about that.
Oh, yes.
So you did.
Tell me. Is there anything
I can talk about?
Is there no one to answer the door?
Where are the servants?
They're out there.
Fighting for their lives.
Young man, tell Mr. Biddle
I'm waiting in the parlor.
I have no intention of going out into that mob.
Yes, ma'am.
Do you know who that young man is?
That is Angier Duke.
There are those who would consider the heir to a multimillion-dollar fortune improper choice for errand boy.
And there are those sufficiently accustomed to wealth that the only thing to be considered in such a choice is how well will the young man perform the errand.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Drexel.
But I will have a closer look when he comes back.
He must be quite something if Cordy can spend a month in New York and still want to marry him.
If you ladies will make yourselves comfortable,
I'll fetch some nice refreshments.
There are those who consider New York the only true city in the country.
And there are those who wear bibs when they eat.
But generally speaking, they are not persons of influence.
- Indeed.
- Indeed.
Champagne punch and some darling little sandwiches.
? There are those whose social standing?
? Is constantly demanding?
? Every single thing we do, the public knows?
? Then there is a lower strata?
? Where propriety doesn't matter?
? I suppose?
? There are those?
? There are those?
? There are those to whom position?
? Is a natural-born condition?
? To be worn with ease like comfortable old clothes?
? Though the nouveau riche deny it?
? All their money cannot buy it?
? Class will out?
Goodness knows.
? But there are those?
Watercress on toast, ma'am?
? There are those who grace the pages of the Blue Book?
Never heard of it.
Is it a new book?
Simply anyone who is anyone is listed.
Oh. You mean the New York telephone directory?
Hardly.
There are those whose names predate the Constitution.
Yes, and some of them opposed the Revolution.
Conservative.
Reactionary.
Cream cheese and cucumber?
? Philadelphia is the cradle of liberty?
? Slumbering like an aging page of history?
Chopped liver?
? There are those who flaunt prosperity?
? There are those who flaunt austerity?
? Posing cozy on their rosy status quos?
Poison dart?
I mean, raisin tart?
? There are those quite influential?
? There are those inconsequential?
? There are those?
? There are those?
? There are those?
? There are those?
? There are those?
- I suppose.
- I suppose.
- There are those.
- There are those.
Well, Mrs. Duke,
I see you've met Aunt Mary.
Good afternoon, Aunt Mary.
Aunt Mary, I was looking for you in the garden.
Not in that mob.
Hello, Aunt Mary.
Cordy.
Aunt Mary, this is Angie.
They've met.
Mrs. Drexel, I would like to ask you a question or two about how weddings are managed by proper Philadelphians.
Mother, you promised.
What about the way weddings are managed by Philadelphians?
Would anyone like a sandwich?
No.
No, thank you, John.
Is something wrong, Mrs. Duke?
Something is decidedly wrong.
I'll have a sandwich.
Let's all have a sandwich.
What about the wedding?
They really look delicious.
Won't you have one, Mother?
I've already had one.
What about the wedding, blast it?
I would like to know,
Mr. Biddle, why the Dukes have not received invitations.
As I understand it, the Drexels and the Biddles are coming by the thousands.
It is customary in most societies to invite the family of the groom as well.
But there was a separate box of Duke invitations.
Yes.
Yes, I remember that.
Could something have gone wrong at the post office?
John and I took them in ourselves.
- John?
- Sir.
See if you can find out anything.
Yes, sir.
I'm sure there's some simple explanation.
We'll certainly take care of it, Mrs. Duke.
These little things happen.
Little things?
How would you feel if the
Drexels had not been invited?
They'd come anyhow.
They're relatives.
It may surprise you to know that the laws of kinship operate in New York and in North Carolina.
Only one thing surprises me,
Mrs. Duke.
Wait a minute.
If you could just...
Stop it!
All of you!
Duke pride.
Drexel pride.
Biddle pride.
Philadelphia versus New York.
I'm sick to death of it.
Angie and I have been shoved aside while everyone is busy turning our wedding into the biggest production and the biggest fight in history.
It isn't fair.
And I'm not going to let it go on this way if Angie and I have to elope!
Elope?
And make us all look like fools?
At this moment, Mrs. Duke,
I don't care what you look like.
Cordy.
Angier, you had better speak to your bride.
This wedding is going to take place on schedule.
And it is going to be done right.
Once you're safe in our railroad car and on your way to Arkansas, you can indulge your whim.
Until then...
Arkansas?
What about Arkansas?
Cordy, I'm sorry.
Well, what are you sorry about?
I have arranged for our private railroad car to take you and Angier to Hot Springs then back to New York in two weeks for the board of directors' meeting.
Angie.
How could you?
Well, what, please tell me, is wrong with Hot Springs?
I'm sure nothing is wrong with it, Mrs. Duke.
But I'm not going to spend my honeymoon there.
Cordy, if we could just talk things over.
Just like I'm not going to live in New York.
Of course you're going to live in New York.
Because I'm not going to marry you.
What?
- Cordy.
You most certainly are going to marry him.
She doesn't have to if she doesn't want to.
Anthony.
What happened to the person
I fell in love with?
A person with dreams and spirit.
Someone I could believe in and root for.
Someone who could make a car any color you want.
Oh, no.
I'm not getting married.
- Then I'm not, either!
- Sir!
I found them, sir.
200 invitations.
They were lost under the clothes we collected for the Chinese missions.
That's very funny.
No.
It really is.
You'll pardon me for not laughing.
Angier!
Angier!
Angier!
John, maybe you'd better follow him.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Biddle, what do you intend to do about this?
Do about it?
Yes. You do intend to do something, don't you?
Yes, Anthony.
What now?
Well, I don't know.
What do you suggest?
I suggest you talk some sense into your daughter.
For once I agree with Mrs. Duke completely.
Wait a minute.
What about trying to talk some sense into your son, Mrs. Duke?
I'll take care of Angier.
Mrs. Duke, may I offer you a lift to your hotel?
My electric is waiting outside.
Oh, how very kind of you.
It's comforting to know that there are those who can be relied upon for support in times of stress.
They're trying to lay this whole mess in my lap.
We'd better get back to our guests.
They're trying to blame me.
Anyone can misplace a box of invitations, can't they?
You know very well, Anthony, the invitations have nothing to do with it.
That was just fate lending you a helping hand.
Blast.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Did I, George?
- Hey, here he is!
- Come on, Mr. Biddle.
- We want to drink a toast.
- To the father of the bride!
Now, just a second.
- Outside!
- A toast!
Three cheers!
? For he's a jolly good fellow?
? For he's a jolly good fellow?
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Stout!
Did you ever try a good Irish stout?
Look, you stay away from me.
Just a friendly suggestion, sir.
You followed me here, didn't you?
The devil, I did.
Do you think you're the only person that comes into Clancy's for a little rest and relaxation?
All right, just leave me alone and keep your suggestions to yourself.
Stout.
I'm tired of people running my life for me.
As well you should be, sir.
Leading me by the hand.
Telling me what to do.
It's a crime.
A man has to finally be a man.
- Right!
- Right!
? Well, well, well,
"Let's have a drink on it"?
? As me father used to say?
? "When the truth is nobly spoken?
? It's respect you've got to pay"?
? So fill your cup and lift it up?
? And clink, here's how?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
I don't mind telling you.
These last weeks have really been rough.
That's a fact.
You try to please everybody.
And you end up pleasing no one at all.
'Tis the sad, sad truth, sir.
I'll get away from it all.
Good idea.
I'll leave Philadelphia and never come back.
- Never?
- Never.
Well, why shouldn't I?
There's nothing but trouble for me here.
There's nothing but trouble for me anywhere.
If I were to go to the ends of the Earth...
That's it.
I could join the Foreign Legion.
The Foreign Legion, sir.
A fine group of men, sir.
I'd be on my own, then, right?
Right!
? Well, well, well, let's have a drink on it?
? To the fightin'
Legionnaires?
? To their outposts in the desert?
? And their gorgeous
Croix de Guerres?
? To sailing for Bengasi on a rusty scow?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
Thank you, John.
I'll always be grateful for your help.
Where are you going?
To Bengasi.
Like we said.
I can't let him get away.
We'll never get things patched up.
Sir!
A moment of your time, sir!
Just a moment!
? What do you do when the water's gone?
? And there's no turning back??
? You're four days from the fort?
? The Arab renegades attack?
? And the blistering sun keeps burning?
? Reinforcements can't get through?
? What do you do about it??
? What do you do about it??
Do you blister easily?
Yes, as a matter of fact.
The Foreign Legion is not for you.
Drink up.
You're right, John.
Running away isn't the answer.
You're right.
I'm right, all right.
I've got to face my problem head on.
All right.
What's my problem?
My problem is my family.
It always has been.
I'll change my name.
Renounce my fortune.
That's good thinking.
I'll take an honest job.
In a factory.
Or on a farm.
Maybe someday I'll have my own place.
- Beautiful!
- I'll be like everybody else.
Poor, right?
- Right!
- Right!
? Well, well, well, let's have a drink on it?
? To the simple, average life?
? To the wages every Friday?
? That you bring home to the wife?
? To the sweat of honest labor on your average brow?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
Hey!
Set 'em up, Clancy!
Whoo!
Hey!
The drinks are on the Duke!
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
Thank you all!
I can't tell you how much this talk has meant to me.
Not at all at all.
- I'll write when I get settled.
- You'll write...
From where are you gonna write?
When a man has reached a turning point in his life, why waste time?
? What do you do when you lose your job??
? The rent is overdue??
? The landlord throws you in the street?
? The wife, the kiddies, too?
? And the sleet and snow are falling?
? And you've got no place to go?
Will you shut your face?
Can't you see I'm talking to the gentleman?
? What do you do about it??
? What do you do about it??
The simple, average life, sir.
No.
Have a drink.
I'm used to having money.
I might as well admit it.
I know.
I could make my own fortune.
- I could drill for oil in Texas.
- Think it over carefully.
- I could pan for gold in Alaska.
- Don't be too hasty.
Wait.
The pearl trade in China.
The mysterious East.
Who knows what adventures
I might live there?
- Right.
- Right!
- Wrong.
-? Well, well, well?
? Let's have a drink on it?
? Here's to China across the bay?
? To them darling little oysters?
? And the pearls they give away?
? A man could make his fortune there?
? I will somehow?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? I'm off to China now?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? He's off to China now?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have another one, sir!?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
Ha!
Ooh! Ooh!
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? I'm off to China now?
? Well, well, well, one last drink on it?
? Then you're on your merry way?
? What do you do when your sampan springs a leak?
? In China Bay??
? When the truth is nobly spoken?
? It's respect you've got to pay?
? Them Oriental pirates come and take your pearls away?
? So fill your cup and lift it up?
-? And clink, here's how?
- Do you eat fish heads?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
Are you immune to yellow fever?
Bubonic plague!
Monsoons!
Locusts!
The screaming abdabs!
Oh, the shame of it all!
Do that again, me buckle, and you won't be going anywhere.
Clancy, two more.
Have a drink, sir.
All the very best.
Are you all right, lad?
There's nothing broken, I hope.
I think we best be going to the hotel to have the house doctor take a look at you.
Excuse me, John.
Aah!
Oh! Oh!
Oh!
Oh! Oh!
Ooh!
All right, I say!
Quiet!
Quiet!
All right, now.
Who started all this?
Well, come on.
Come on.
Somebody speak up, or I'll jail the lot of youse just as sure as my name's Flanagan.
Seems a shame to punish men for defending their mother country.
What's that?
I wasn't a part of it meself, you understand.
But I did see it all from first to last.
And?
Well, it all started when the young gentleman there expressed the opinion that all Irishmen were pigs.
And the Emerald Isle the proper sty for them.
Oh, he did, did he?
Huh?
He did indeed.
I see.
All right, you two.
Bring young Mr. Fancy Dan along.
Hey!
And I'll thank you to come along, too, sir.
The captain will be delighted to hear what you told me.
I consider it me duty, Sergeant.
All right.
Bring him along.
Have no fear, lad.
I'm looking out for you.
Good morning, Cordelia.
How is Cordy this morning?
Have you seen her?
I had a cold shower and a good, brisk walk.
And now I'm hungry.
Thank you, my dear.
Yes, ma'am?
Yes, sir?
I think I'll start with some orange juice.
Who are you?
I'm Deborah, sir.
Well.
Good morning, Deborah.
Good morning, sir.
I think after the orange juice
I'd like some cereal.
Yes, sir.
Pleasant-enough-looking girl, isn't she?
Confound it, Cordelia.
You can't go on ignoring me like this forever.
And that's how long it will be before I respond to such childish behavior.
What do you want from me?
Let's hear it.
Some kind of confession.
That's what you want, isn't it?
You're not going to get it.
I have nothing to confess.
Will that be hot or cold cereal, sir?
Neither one, blast it!
I'm not hungry.
I will admit I have wondered if Angie was the right man for Cordy.
But she made her choice.
And I accepted it,
I think, gracefully.
I've just been myself, that's all.
You've been yourself in spades.
Cordelia.
Where did you learn that back-room expression?
You played into every possible source of trouble from the first.
Oh, there was trouble to play into, I'll grant.
You didn't create it, but how you took advantage.
I deny that.
Then let me put it this way.
Have you done one thing to help this marriage?
I don't believe that's my responsibility.
Isn't it, Anthony?
I know of nothing
I've done wrong.
Nothing.
You know it in your heart.
Or you wouldn't be so angry.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mother.
Good morning, Papa.
How about a jog around the square?
Why, Cordy.
Or maybe a few rounds in the gym?
Confound it, Cordy.
You can't come popping in here, gay as a cricket.
Why not?
How should I be?
Cordy.
What are we going to do?
About what, Mother?
About your marriage.
It's been called off.
Don't you remember?
I'll be in the stable.
Cordy.
Cordy, wait.
Cordy.
I don't want to talk about it, Papa.
I don't want to talk, either.
But that doesn't mean
I'm not going to.
There's nothing to talk about.
You never really approved of Angie.
And you were right.
He's a baby.
A mama's boy.
He doesn't know what life is all about.
He'll learn.
Maybe you'll learn together.
But you can't take his part now.
I'm not taking his part.
But I've got nothing against that boy, Cordy.
I never did.
Except that I wanted you to stay here.
That's the truth.
You try to make a good life for yourself and your family.
And turns out to be too good.
So you can't resist trying to hold on.
Whatever you decide to do,
Cordy, I'll back you up 100%.
But you decide.
On your own.
It's your life.
I'm finally giving it over to you.
Where is he?
Good morning, Mrs. Duke.
If you know where he is, please tell me.
I'll find out in good time anyway.
Do you mean Angie?
Of course I mean Angier.
- Well, what's happened?
- He's disappeared.
Disappeared?
He wasn't in his hotel room all night.
His bed has not been slept in.
Who knows what has happened to him?
John!
Now, don't worry, Mrs. Duke.
We'll find him.
- John!
- You called, sir?
I yelled.
John, I thought I asked you to watch out for Mr. Duke.
- I did.
- What happened to your eye?
He hit me, sir.
Angier?
When?
Last night at the jailhouse.
The jailhouse?
They'll release him as soon as
I withdraw the charges, ma'am.
Well, we'd better get down there right away.
I'll hurry and get dressed.
Yes, Cordelia.
Mrs. Duke, why don't you wait out here on the terrace?
John, bring the car around front, will you?
We'll have this unfortunate situation cleared up in no time.
Oh, dear.
I may faint.
On this floor?
Don't even think of it.
Mrs. Duke, perhaps it'd be better if you ladies waited here.
All right, Mr. Duke.
You can come out now.
I'd just as soon stay right here.
Well, that's a pretty silly attitude.
It isn't silly at all.
I'm afraid if I stand up my head will fall off.
Did you ever try a good Irish stout?
Come along.
Come along, Mr. Duke.
It's time to go now.
Why couldn't you let me out last night when I wanted out?
Where was it you wanted to go last night?
I had decided on China.
How do feel about China this morning?
Terrible.
Sergeant, would you give us a minute?
Oh, certainly.
Certainly.
Young man.
It's time you woke up to your responsibilities.
I want you to get this marriage over with.
And that honeymoon in the Ozarks.
Then report back to your desk in New York.
What?
You may think you want other things for yourself.
You may have some dreams of your own.
But you'll have to get over all that.
The way other people do.
Well, you didn't get over it.
Well, there are darn few like me.
Now, you listen here,
Mr. Know-it-all Biddle.
No one is gonna run my life for me.
I've decided that much.
Hangover or no hangover.
Is that so?
Yes.
That is so.
All right, Mr. Duke.
The door's open.
Let's see you have a try at running your own life.
Let's see how far you can go.
Hangover or no hangover.
Mr. Biddle.
I am going to ask Cordy to elope with me.
- Today.
- Now, wait a minute.
And don't you try to stop me.
Let me tell you one thing.
If you ask Cordy to elope, she won't.
Then I'll tell her.
Angier.
Morning, Mother.
Cordy.
You and I are going to elope.
Over my dead body!
Only if absolutely necessary,
Mother.
We'll stop by your house and pick up your things.
No.
Why?
Because I think he talked you into it.
Cordy, I love you, and I want to marry you.
And he's got nothing to do with that.
I'm not so sure about that.
Papa!
So long, everybody.
We'll write.
Angier, where are you going?
? You can here it humming, see it coming?
? Feel it everywhere you go?
? It's tomorrow morning, the future dawning?
? With a bright and shining glow?
? It's a land where golden chariots?
? Are molded out of dreams?
? It's Detroit?
? Detroit?
? It's Detroit?
You know, there, for a minute, he reminded me of his grandfather.
Started the whole Duke thing.
If he's half the man
I think he is, this won't be the end of the whole Duke thing, either.
Did you hear that?
It's the floor, dear.
I never noticed it before.
This isn't a new house.
No.
No, it isn't.
I'm hungry.
Oh.
Poor dear.
You didn't have any breakfast, did you?
I'll ring for John.
I don't need much.
What's that?
Hmm?
The clock, dear.
Oh.
A new one?
We've had it 20 years.
Oh.
You rang, ma'am?
Could we have some tea, please?
And there must be some sandwiches left.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Did everything turn out all right down at the jailhouse?
Angie and Cordy are on their way to Detroit.
Well.
That's grand news.
That's right.
That's right.
We're very happy about it.
I'll take that, ma'am.
Thank you, John.
Shouldn't we telephone the boys about the wedding?
Oh, they'll be in class.
That's right.
Better wait until this evening.
- It's been a long time...
- We should let Aunt Mary know.
- What was that, Cordelia?
- I was thinking.
Maybe we could do some traveling now that the children are all...
That's a good idea.
I've always wanted to travel.
We can go to Detroit and see Cordy and Angie.
Oh, Anthony.
Yeah.
? Let them go, let them go?
? Let them try their wings?
? Little birds were born to fly?
? Not until they roam can they miss their home?
? And it won't be long till Christmas?
? When the branches are bare?
? The December air?
? Comes alive with frost and pine?
? And they'll yearn to be?
? By the family tree?
? Oh, it won't be long till Christmas?
? The years go by?
? And every night?
? You say, "Sweet dreams, sleep tight"?
? Then comes the day you're forced to say?
? "Don't forget to write"?
? There'll be holly and popcorn?
? And mistletoe?
? There'll be songs by fireglow?
? Oh, it won't be long till Christmas?
? Let them go?
? Let them go?
? It won't be long till Christmas?
? Let them go?
? Let them go?
Who would be dropping by this afternoon?
I can't imagine.
Hardly anybody lives here anymore.
The tea will be a moment.
Mrs. Worth's icing up a gorgeous chocolate cake.
Come in, gentlemen.
Sir, is Mr. Biddle at home?
Yes.
Will you come this way, please?
There's some gentlemen to see you, sir.
Well, look who's here.
- Mr. Biddle.
- Lieutenant.
- Mr. Biddle.
- Good to see you.
Sir, a set of orders have been received at our headquarters concerning your future relations with the Corps.
And we felt that these orders warranted personal delivery.
I don't believe it.
Anthony, what is it?
When I tried to enlist, they turned me down.
Said I was too old for active service.
Anthony, for heaven's sake.
Cordelia, I've been awarded a provisional captaincy in the Marine Corps.
I'm ordered to report to Parris Island.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you.
Congratulations, Mr. Biddle.
- John!
- Yes, sir?
John, we're in the Marines.
- We are, sir?
- Yes.
Bring out some of that good Madeira, will you?
You know, gentlemen, there's something to which I've been giving a lot of thought.
The French and the British have been in this war for some time.
They must have perfected close-combat techniques which are more realistic than ours.
I feel that we ought to send someone over there to observe and learn.
Anthony, I don't think that somebody who's been in the Marines for less than five minutes should be trying to decide
Corps policy.
He's sure to end up running things, Mrs. Biddle.
He might as well start off that way.
Oh, thank you, John.
You should've brought one for yourself.
I'm not much at making speeches.
But I guess you know how we all feel about this.
Mr. Biddle has landed.
And the Marines are well in hand.
Right?
- Right!
- Right!
? Well, well, well?
? "Let's have a drink on it," as me father used to say?
? When the truth is nobly spoken?
? It's respect you've got to pay?
? So fill your cup and lift it up?
? And clink, here's how?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
? No shilly-shallying, no dillydallying?
? Let's have a drink on it now?
Excuse me, ma'am.
Well.
Congratulations, Captain Biddle.
Thank you, Cordelia.
- Where's Mr. Biddle?
- Step this way, gentlemen.
We rushed right over as soon as we heard, Captain.
? Well, well, well,
"Let's have a drink on it"?
? As me father used to say?
? When the truth is nobly spoken?
? It's respect you've got to pay?
? So fill your cup and lift it up?

I'm glad to hear it.
Maybe we'll finally have some peace around here.

Call on Dolly
If your neighbour needs a new romance
Just name the kind of man your sister wants, and she'll snatch him up
Don't forget to bring your maiden aunts and she'll match 'em up
Call on
"Mrs. Dolly Levi."
She's the one the spinsters recommend
She even found a lovely bride for poor cousin Isadore
"Social introductions arranged."
Drag your single relations out
In a week you'll have to send engraved invitations out
"In an atmosphere of elegance and refinement."
Call on Dolly
"Object: matrimony."
If your eldest daughter needs a friend
Just name the kind of man your sister wants, and she'll snatch him up
Don't forget to bring your maiden aunts and she'll match 'em up
Call on Dolly
If your eldest daughter needs a friend
I have always been a woman who arranges things
For the pleasure and the profit it derives
I have always been a woman who arranges things
Like furniture and daffodils and lives
If you want your sister courted, brother wed or cheese imported
Just leave everything to me
If you want your roof inspected, eyebrows tweezed or bills collected
Just leave everything to me
If you want your daughter dated, or some marriage consummated
For a rather modest fee
If you want a husband spotted, boyfriend traced or chicken potted
I'll arrange for making all arrangements
Just leave everything to me
- Business or pleasure, Mrs. Levi?
- Mr. Jones, business is always a pleasure.
And you've got more businesses than a dog has fleas!
As my late husband, Ephraim Levi, used to say:
"If you have to live from hand to mouth, you better be ambidextrous!"
If you want your ego bolstered, muscles toned or chair upholstered
Just leave everything to me
Charming social introductions, expert mandolin instructions
Just leave everything to me
If you want your culture rounded,
French improved or torso pounded
With a ten-year guarantee
If you want a birth recorded, collies bred or kittens boarded
I'll proceed to plan the whole procedure
Just leave everything to me
- Where to, Dolly?
- Yonkers.
To handle a highly personal matter for Mr. Vandergelder, the well-known unmarried half-a-millionaire.
- Gonna marry him yourself?
- Why, Mr. Sullivan, whatever put such a preposterous idea into my head?
Your head.
If you want a law abolished, jury swayed or toenails polished
Just leave everything to me
If you want your liver tested, glasses made, cash invested
Just leave everything to me
If you want your children coddled, corsets boned or furs remodelled
Or some nice, fresh fricassee
If you want your bustle shifted, wedding planned or bosom lifted
Don't be ashamed, girls!
Life is full of secrets and I keep 'em!
I'll discreetly use my own discretion
I'll arrange for making all arrangements
I'll proceed to plan the whole procedure
Just leave everything
To me
- And I'm telling you that I will marry her!
- Not without my permission, you won't!
This is a free country, not a private kingdom.
She's consented and I'll marry her.
- I'm telling you that you won't.
- I'm telling you I will.
- Never.
- Tomorrow. Today.
Ermengarde is not for you.
You can't support her. You are an artist.
- I make a good living.
- A living, Mr. Kemper, is made by selling something that everybody needs at least once a year.
And a million is made by producing something everybody needs every day.
You artists, you painters, produce nothing that nobody needs, never.
You might as well know, any way we can find to get married is right and fair and we'll do it.
You are an impractical, seven-foot-tall nincompoop.
- That's an insult.
- All the facts about you are insults.
- Thank you for the honour of your visit.
- Ermengarde is of age and there's no law...
Law? The law is there to prevent crime. Men of sense are there to prevent foolishness.
It is I that will prevent you from marrying my niece.
And I've already taken the necessary steps.
Mrs. Dolly Levi is on her way here even now.
Dolly Levi? Your marriage broker?
Never mind that. She'll pick up Ermengarde and take her to New York, and keep her there until this foolishness is over.
- We'll see about that.
- Thank you again for the honour...
You have to sit still, Mr. Vandergelder.
If I cut your throat it will be practically unintentional.
90% of the people in this world are fools and the rest are in great danger of contamination.
Enough of this.
I'm a busy man with things to do.
A scraped chin is the least of them.
I did the best I could, Mr. Vandergelder.
- Joe.
- Yes?
I've got special reasons for looking my best today.
Is there something a little extra you can do? A little special?
What?
You know, do some of those things you do to the young fellas.
Smarten me up a little bit.
Face massage. A little perfume water.
All I know is 15 cents' worth, like usual, and that includes all that's decent to do.
Listen, I don't want you blabbing this, but I need something extra today because I'm going to New York to call on a very refined lady, name of Miss Irene Molloy.
Your callin' on ladies is none of my business, Mr. Vandergelder.
- Hold your horses, Joe.
- Uncle Horace!
- Uncle Horace!
- Yes, what is it?
- What have you done to Ambrose?
- I had a quiet talk with him.
- You did?
- Yes, I explained to him that he's a fool.
- Oh, Uncle!
- Weeping, weeping - a waste of water.
I've done you a good turn.
You'll thank me when you're 50.
But, Uncle, I love him.
Save your tears for New York, where they won't be noticed.
- But I love him!
- You don't.
- But I do!
- Leave those things to me.
If I don't marry Ambrose, I know I'll die!
- Of what?
- A broken heart.
Never heard of it. Are you ready for Mrs. Levi when she comes?
Yes.
Well, get ready some more and stay in your room until she arrives.
Cornelius!
Barnaby!
Barnaby!
Cornelius! Barnaby!
- You stamped, Mr. Vandergelder?
- Yes, I stamped.
Are my niece's bags at the railroad station?
- Yes.
- And you, did you label them properly?
- Yes.
- Good.
I'm going to New York on important business, then I'll be marching in the parade.
- Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.
- I'm planning to stay at the Central Hotel.
We've never been here alone,
Mr. Vandergelder.
Now, in honour of the occasion, I'll promote you both. Cornelius, how old are you?
28¾, Mr. Vandergelder.
Is that all? That's a foolish age to be at. I thought you were 40.
No, I'm 28¾.
Well, a man's not worth a cent till he's 40.
We pay him wages until then to make mistakes.
- Anyway, I'm promoting you to chief clerk.
- Chief clerk?
- Yes.
- Well, what am I now?
You're an impertinent fool. If you behave,
I'll promote you from fool to chief clerk, with a raise in your wages.
Thank you, Mr. Vandergelder.
You, Barnaby, I'm promoting you from idiot apprentice to incompetent clerk.
- Thank you, Mr. Vandergelder.
- Mr. Vandergelder? Mr. Vandergelder?
What is it?
Does the chief clerk get one evening off a week?
So that's how you thank me, eh?
No, sir. You'll attend to the store as usual.
You keep on asking for evenings free and you'll find you have all your days free.
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.
And when I come back I wanna hear that you ran the place perfectly.
If I hear of any foolishness, I'll fire you both.
Yes.
You might as well know it now.
When I return there will be some changes around here.
- You're going to have a mistress.
- I'm too young, Mr. Vandergelder.
Not yours, idiot. Mine. I mean,
I'm planning to get married.
- Married?
- Yes, married. Any objections?
No, but...
No, many congratulations,
Mr. Vandergelder.
- And to the lady.
- That's none of your business.
- Any questions?
- No, but...
- But what?
- But I mean...
- Speak up.
- Why?
- Why what, damn it! Speak up!
- Why are you getting married?
Let me tell you something, son.
I've worked hard and I've become rich and friendless and mean.
And in America it's about as far as you can go.
It's time to be doing something a little bit foolish.
Besides, I need a steady housekeeper.
It takes a woman, all powdered and pink
To joyously clean out the drain in the sink
And it takes an angel with long, golden lashes
And soft Dresden fingers for dumping the ashes
Yes, it takes a woman, a dainty woman
A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife
Oh, yes, it takes a woman
A fragile woman
To bring you the sweet things in life
The frail young maiden, who's constantly there
For washing and blueing, and shoeing the mare
And it takes a female for setting the table
And weaning the Guernsey and cleaning the stable
Yes, it takes a woman
A dainty woman
A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife
Oh, yes, it takes a woman
A fragile woman
To bring you the sweet things in life
And so she'll work until infinity
Three cheers for femininity
God bless fem-i-nin-i-ty
And in the winter she'll shovel the ice
And lovingly set out the traps for the mice
She's a joy and treasure for, practically speaking,
To whom can you turn when the plumbing is leaking?
To that dainty woman
That fragile woman
That sweetheart, that mistress, that wife
That womanly wife
Oh, yes, it takes a woman
A husky woman
To bring you the sweet things in life
Oh, yes, it takes a woman
A dainty woman
A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife
Oh, yes, it takes a woman
A fragile woman
To bring you the sweet things in life
Well, well, well, well, well.
Good morning, Mr. Vandergelder.
Mr. Hackl. Mr. Tucker.
- Gentlemen.
- Good morning, ma'am.
Uh, morning, Mrs. Levi.
How handsome you look today. Ooh, you absolutely take my breath away.
Ermengarde is crying her eyes out.
You can take her to New York, but blow her nose first.
If only Irene Molloy could see you now.
Find someplace else to loaf. And you two get back to the store. Go on!
And don't forget to put the lid on the sheep dip.
I don't know what's come over you lately, but you seem to be growing younger every day.
Well, if a man eats careful, there's no reason why he should look old.
- You never said a truer word.
- Even if I never see 40... uh, 35, again.
35. I can see that you're the sort that will be stamping about at 100, eating five meals a day, like my Uncle Harry, may he rest in peace.
Let me see your hand, Mr. Vandergelder.
Oh, show me your hand.
- Why?
- I'm a judge of hands. I read hands.
- And I use them to get things done.
- Oh! Lord in heaven! Goodness gracious!
Oh, I just can't believe it.
It's such a long lifeline.
- Where?
- From here I don't know where it goes.
It runs right off your hand.
They'll have to hit you with a mallet.
They'll have to stifle you with a sofa pillow. You'll bury us all.
I will?
Say, you're all spiffed up today, aren't you?
- Yes.
- And not for this smelly horse, either.
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say you was goin' somewhere.
Remarkable, Mrs. Levi. How do you do it?
Two and two is four, Mr. Vandergelder.
With a head like yours you'll be a rich woman someday.
That's exactly what I had in mind.
Then I suggest you go about your business and pick up Ermengarde,
- for which I am paying you good money.
- Speaking of business, Mr. Vandergelder,
I suppose you've given up all idea of getting married?
- Is that what you suppose?
- Uh-huh.
Then suppose you listen to this, Mrs. Levi.
I've decided I've practically decided to ask Irene Molloy to be my wife.
- You have?
- Yes, I have.
I'm going to New York and discuss it with her this very afternoon.
Well, that is just about the best news
I have ever heard, Mr. Vandergelder.
Oh, yes, indeed. Marvellous news.
Oh, dear me. Isn't it wonderful?
I mean, I'm racking my brain, trying to think of something that's made me happier, but I just can't come up with a thing, because this is just too wonderful.
Well, it's all your fault, you know.
You put me into this marryin' frame of mind with all your introductions and scheming.
- A widow has to earn a living.
- One day I wake up
- and the house seems like an empty shell.
- Certainly is.
- And messy, too.
- Certainly is.
A man needs someone to take out the garbage.
And Irene Molloy's just the one to do it. Oh, darling girl.
Well, I think it's perfectly wonderful what's going to happen in your household.
I never did like the idea of all that money of yours lying around in piles in the bank, so useless and motionless. As my late husband, Ephraim Levi, used to say:
"Money should circulate like rainwater."
"It should flow down among the people, through little dressmakers and restaurants, setting up a business here, furnishing a good time there."
I just know that you and Mrs. Vandergelder will see that all your hard-earned wealth starts flowing in and around many people's lives, just flowing...
- All right. Stop saying that!
- Pouring out...
So there's nothing more for me to do but wish you happiness
- and say goodbye.
- Yes, well, goodbye.
And when I get to New York,
I'll tell the girl I had lined up for you, the heiress, not to wait.
- What did you say?
- Oh, nothing, nothing. A word. "Heiress."
Well, just a minute. That's kind of unusual, isn't it, Mrs. Levi?
Well, I haven't been wearing myself to the bone hunting up usual girls to interest you.
But now all that's too late.
You're engaged to marry Irene Molloy.
- I am not engaged.
- I cannot keep upsetting the finest women around unless you mean business.
- Who said I don't mean business?
- You're playing a very dangerous game.
- Dangerous?
- Of course it's dangerous. It's called
"tampering with a woman's affections".
The only way to save yourself from that charge is to get married to someone soon, very soon.
- Don't worry.
- I won't.
I'll meet you in front of
Irene Molloy's hat shop at 2. 30.
- Never mind. You've done your work.
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.
I want to be there to make sure nothing goes wrong.
Just tend to Ermengarde or else I'll ask you to return the fee I gave you for that.
- Speaking of money...
- Oh, no. How much?
Well, I left my money in the handbag I took to the cleaner's just before it burned down.
20! Oh, bless you, and don't you worry your handsome head about a thing.
Just keep all your thoughts on that lovely Irene Molloy.
It takes a woman to quietly plan
To take him and change him to her kind of man
And to gently lead him where fortune can find him
And not let him know
That the power behind him
Was that dainty woman
That fragile woman
That sweetheart
That mistress
That wife
Da, da, da, da
Da, da, da
If he had any taste at all, he'd have the shutters done over in green.
Mm, forest-green shutters.
-  What are you doing?
-  Hurry!
- My uncle...
- He just left.
Now quick! We're running away.
- Running away?
- Hurry, before the train gets here!
- Train?
- To New York, to get married.
- We're going to elope.
- Elope? That's such an awful word.
- Oh, Ermengarde.
- My, what a romantic scene.
Oh, Mrs. Levi, please explain to Ambrose.
I wanna marry him, but not elope.
- This doesn't concern Mrs. Levi.
- Everything concerns Dolly Levi.
- Don't listen to her. I know why you're here.
- To help. Love needs all the help it can get.
- Wait a minute. Listen to me.
- There's no time.
Can we climb in? I feel an updraught in my underpants.
- Oh, Mrs. Levi!
- This is no way to elope.
If you follow my suggestions, not only will he let you marry but he'll dance at your wedding.
And not alone, either.
Mr. Kemper, can you dance?
- Dance? I'm an artist, Mrs. Levi. I paint.
- No problem.
- "Mrs. Levi. Painters taught how to dance."
- Here's what we'll do.
- I'm going to take you to New York.
- See? I told you.
You will stay close by. Tonight you will take her to dinner at the Harmonia Gardens.
There's this man, Rudolph Reisenweber.
He knows me well.
We'll enter you in the polka contest.
The prize is a gold cup and some money, and you'll win it.
- Oh, the cups we won, my husband and I.
- Now, wait a minute.
I'm surprised you have acquaintances in a place like that.
Not acquaintances, Ermengarde. Friends.
Dear friends from days gone by.
My late husband, Ephraim Levi, believed in life, any place you could find it, wherever there were people, all kinds of people.
And every Friday night, even when times were bad, every Friday night, like clockwork, down those stairs of the Harmonia
Gardens we came, Ephraim and I.
Not acquaintances, Ermengarde. Friends.
It's all very well for you, but you're suggesting that we...
Mr. Kemper, do you or do you not wish to show Horace that you mean business?
Yes!
All right, then. Go to the Harmonia
Gardens and say that Mrs. Levi sent you.
And, oh... yes, well, tell Rudolph...
Tell Rudolph that Dolly's coming back.
Dolly's coming back?
And I want a table for two and a chicken for eight o'clock.
Mr. Vandergelder will learn of your triumph and everything will work out beautifully.
- But how, Mrs. Levi? How?
- How?
Oh.
28¾ years old and I still don't get an evening free.
When am I gonna begin to live?
Barnaby? How much money have you got?
- H uh?
- I mean, that you can get your hands on?
- About three dollars. Why?
- Barnaby, you and I are going to New York.
Cornelius, we can't. Close the store?
We'll have to, cos some rotten cans of chicken mash are going to explode.
Holy cabooses! How do you know?
Because I'll light some candles under them.
They'll make such a stink that customers won't be able to come in for 24 hours.
That'll get us an evening free. We are going to New York and we are gonna live.
We're gonna have a good meal, be in danger, get almost arrested.
- And we're gonna spend all our money.
- Holy cabooses!
And one more thing.
We are not coming back to Yonkers until we've each kissed a girl.
Cornelius, you can't do that.
You don't know any girls.
I'm 28¾. I gotta begin sometime.
I'm only 19½.
With me it's not so urgent.
May I make a suggestion, gentlemen?
Mrs. Levi.
- I just couldn't help hearing.
- We'll be fired.
- We were only talking.
- Mr. Hackl, Mr. Tucker, there is nothing that makes me happier than the thought of two fine young men enjoying the company of two lovely ladies.
- What ladies? Where?
- In New York, Mr. Hackl, to which, unless my ears play me tricks, you are bound.
Now, there's this millinery shop run by a charming woman.
- "Irene Molloy"?
- And her attractive assistant, Minnie Fay.
And now that you've noted the address, I have only this to say.
Two o'clock in the afternoon there is the ideal time for friendly conversation.
Definitely no later than 2. 30.
And if you ever say that this was my suggestion, well, I should denounce you both for the terrible liars that you are.
- A millinery shop.
- Women who work!
- Adventure, Barnaby.
- I'm scared.
- Living, Barnaby.
- I'm scared.
- Will ya come, Barnaby?
- Yes, Cornelius! Yes!
The lights of Broadway! Elevated trains!
The stuffed whale at Barnum's museum!
Stuffed whale! Wow!
Women who work! Wow!
All clear up here, Cornelius!
You gonna light 'em all?
Cornelius, look out! That bottom row, they're swelled up like they're ready to burst!
- Holy cabooses! What a smell!
- Let's get dressed, Barnaby.
We're going to New York!
Out there
There's a world outside of Yonkers
Way out there beyond this hick town, Barnaby
There's a slick town, Barnaby
Out there
Full of shine and full of sparkle
Close your eyes and see it glisten, Barnaby
Listen, Barnaby
Put on your Sunday clothes, there's lots of world out there
Get out the brilliantine and dime cigars
We're gonna find adventure in the evening air
Girls in white in a perfumed night
Where the lights are bright as the stars
Put on your Sunday clothes, we're gonna ride through town
In one of those new horse-drawn open cars
We'll see the shows at Delmonico's
And we'll close the town in a whirl
And we won't come home until we've kissed a girl
Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
That you feel as fine as you look
Beneath your parasol the world is all a smile
That makes you feel brand-new down to your toes
Get out your feathers, your patent leathers
Your beads and buckles and bows
For there's no blue Monday in your Sunday
No Monday in your Sunday
No Monday in your Sunday clothes
Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
That you feel as fine as you look
Beneath your parasol the world is all a smile
That makes you feel brand-new down to your toes
Get out your feathers, your patent leathers
Your beads and buckles and bows
For there's no blue Monday in your Sunday clothes
Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
That you feel as fine as you look
Beneath your bowler brim the world's a simple song
A lovely lilt that makes you tilt your nose
Get out your slickers
Your flannel knickers
Your red suspenders and hose
For there's no blue Monday
In your Sunday
No blue Monday
In your Sunday clothes
Ermengarde, keep smiling.
No man wants a little ninny.
Ambrose, do a turn, let me see.
Mr. Hackl, Mr. Tucker, don't forget Irene and Minnie, just forget you ever heard a word from me.
All aboard! All aboard!
All aboard!
Put on your Sunday clothes, there's lots of world out there
Put on your silk cravat and patent shoes
We're gonna find adventure in the evening air
To town we'll trot to a smoky spot
Where the girls are hot as a fuse
Put on your silk high hat and at the turned-up cuff
We'll wear a handmade grey suede buttoned glove
You're gonna take New York by storm
We'll join the Astors at Tony Pastor's
And this I'm positive of
That we won't come home
No, we won't come home
No, we won't come home until we fall in love
Do get done with that, Minnie. The men are eyeing us for the wrong reason.
- A banana a day keeps the doctor away.
- An apple a day.
Do doctors slip on apple peels?
- How are you, Miss Molloy?
- If I felt any better I'd be indecent.
- You are in a mood today.
- I certainly am.
Not that it's any of my business...
Oh, but is it because...? I mean...
I don't mind that you never finish lunch, but I mind that you never finish sentences.
Well, what I meant was, are you really going to?
Silly girl, say it. Am I going to marry Horace Vandergelder?
Yes, I'm seriously considering it, if he asks me.
Oh, I'd rather die on the rack than ask you such a personal question, but why would you?
Because he's rich, that's why. He can rescue me from the millinery business. I hate hats.
- Hate hats?
- A good afternoon to you, Officer Gogarty.
And the rest of the day to you, Miss Molloy.
Ah, Minnie, why is it that all the attractive men in New York are married?
Blarney, Miss Molloy! Blarney!
Come on now, get going, all of you.
- Oh, the way you talk!
- It's natural to talk about men.
- I mean, what you said about hating hats.
- Particularly the women who buy them.
- You don't mean that.
- Oh, yes, I do, Minnie Fay.
All lady milliners are suspected of being wicked women.
Half the time those dowagers who come in, come in merely to stare and wonder.
Oh, how dare they!
And if they were sure, they'd not set foot in the shop again.
- Well, good riddance. Who needs them?
- We do, unfortunately.
So, do I go out to restaurants?
No, it would be bad for business.
Do I go to balls or theatres or operas?
No, it would be bad for business.
The only men I ever meet are the feather merchants who come to sell me things.
Minnie, I'm tired of being suspected of being a wicked woman with nothing to show for it.
Miss Molloy!
Why does everybody have adventures but me?
- Adventures?
- Because I have no spirit, no gumption.
Either I marry Horace Vandergelder or I'm gonna burn this shop down, break out like a fire engine and find myself some excitement.
The things you're saying today.
They're just awful.
Oh, aren't they, though?
And I'm enjoying every word of it.
What's this? A return from
Miss Mortimer again?
Same old story. She wants cherries and feathers. To catch a beau, I suppose.
If you ask me, she'd do better with a heavy veil.
I told her ribbons down the back is the thing to catch a gentleman's eye.
But she'd have none of it.
Minnie, make another hat for Miss Mortimer.
I'm wearing this one myself.
- Oh, but you can't.
- Why not?
Oh, because it's... it's provocative.
That's why not.
Well, who knows that "provocative" isn't just what I might wanna be today.
I'll be wearing ribbons down my back
This summer
Blue and green and streaming in the yellow sky
So if someone special comes my way
This summer
He might notice me
Passing by
And so I'll try to make it easier to find me
In the stillness of July
Because a breeze might stir a rainbow up behind me
That might happen to catch
The gentleman's eye
And he might smile and take me by the hand
This summer
Making me recall how lovely love can be
And so I will proudly wear
Ribbons down my back
Shining in my hair
That he might notice me
Miss Molloy, you don't love
Horace Vandergelder, do you?
- Of course I don't love him.
- Then how can you... I mean...?
Minnie, look. There are two men staring at the shop.
- Men?
- Uh-huh. Aren't they delicious?
You don't think...?
Yes, I do believe they mean to come in here.
- Men in the shop? What'll we do?
- Why, flirt with them, of course.
- I'll give you the short one.
- You're terrible.
We'll heat them up and drop them cold.
Good practice for married life.
- Let's pretty ourselves up a bit.
- If you say "vamp", I'll scream.
- Vamp!
- Agh!
I must say, I like the tall one.
Adventure, Barnaby.
We can still catch the train back to Yonkers.
I feel dizzy.
Or go see the stuffed whale at the museum.
Women, Barnaby.
Stuffed women!
There's no one here. We can leave.
I'd never forgive myself. Agh!
Are you sure this is an adventure,
Cornelius?
You don't have to ask. When you're in one, you'll know it all right.
- How much money is left?
- 40 cents for the train,
30 cents for dinner and
20 cents to see the whale.
Well, when they come out, we'll pretend we're rich.
- That way we won't have to spend a thing.
- Why not say that Mrs. Levi sent us?
No, we're not supposed to ever say that. Shh!
We're two men about town looking for hats for ladies.
What ladies?
"Good afternoon, ma'am.
Wonderful weather we're having."
"How do you do, ma'am?
And how are your hats?"
"Charmed to make your acquaintance.
Lovely place you have here."
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Cornelius Hackl here.
- Barnaby Tucker here.
Irene Molloy here.
I'm very happy to meet you.
Is there anything I can do for you?
See, we're two ladies about town lookin' for hats to Molloy...
We're hats, you see, and wondered if we could buy a lady or two to Molloy with for...
We want a hat. Well, for a lady, of course.
And everyone said to go to
Miss Molloy's cos she's so pretty.
I mean her hats are so pretty.
And what sort of hat would Mrs. Hackl be liking?
Oh, no, Miss Molloy, there is no Mrs. Hackl.
Yes, there is. Your mother.
She didn't mean that.
- Did you, Miss Molloy?
- Now, this lady friend of yours, couldn't she come in with you someday and choose the hat herself?
Impossible. There is no lady friend.
But I thought you said that you were coming here to choose...
- I mean, she's Barnaby's.
- Huh? What?
Yes, but she lives in Yonkers and she said to pick out something reasonable.
- Under a dollar.
- Don't be silly, Barnaby.
Money's no object with us. None at all.
Oh, this is my assistant,
Miss Minnie Fay. Mr. Hackl. Mr. Tucker.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Afternoon ma'am.
Excuse me, Mr. Tucker, did you say Yonkers?
Yes, ma'am, we're from Yonkers.
Well, are you?
Yes. And, forgive me for saying this, but you should see Yonkers, Miss Molloy.
Well, perhaps you and your gentleman friend here in New York might like to see it.
Some say it's the most beautiful town in the world.
- That's what they say.
- So I've heard.
But I'm afraid I don't have a gentleman friend here in New York.
You don't? Barnaby, she doesn't have a gentleman friend.
Hey, that's too bad. You know, if you should happen to have a Sunday free...
You're Catholic, aren't you? Don't let that worry you. I'd be willing to change.
If you're free in the near future, I'd...
Well, we'd like to show you Yonkers from top to bottom.
It's very historic.
As a matter of fact, I might be there sooner than you think.
- This Sunday?
- I have a friend who lives in Yonkers.
- You do?
- Perhaps you know him.
I do?
It's always so foolish to ask in cases like that, isn't it?
Why should you know him?
It's a Mr. Vandergelder.
Mr. Vandergelder? Oh!
- Horace Vandergelder?
- Of Vandergelder's Hay and Feed?
- Yes. Do you know him?
-  Oh, no! No!
No, no, no, no, no, no...
As a matter of fact, he's coming here to see me this very afternoon.
- Coming here?
- This afternoon?
Cornelius! Cornelius, look!
It's a wolf trap.
Look out!
- Begging your pardon.
- What are you doing?
- We'll explain later. Help us just this once.
- Come out of there this minute.
We're as innocent as can be, Miss Molloy.
Mr. Hackl, Mr. Tucker, I insist that you both come out or I'll be forced to...
Mr. Vandergelder, how nice to see you.
- And Dolly Levi, what a surprise.
- Irene, my darling, how well you look.
- You must be in love.
- Afternoon, Miss Molloy.
What a pleasure to have you in New York, Mr. Vandergelder.
Yes, Yonkers lies up there decimated today.
We thought we'd pay you a little visit, Irene.
Unless it's inconvenient?
Inconvenient? Whatever gave you that idea?
Mr. Vandergelder thought he saw two customers in the shop. Two, uh, men?
Men? In a ladies' hat shop?
Come, let's go into my workroom.
I'm so eager for you to see it.
- I've already seen it twice.
- But I need your advice.
Advice from Mr. Vandergelder. The whole city should hear this and grow rich.
Advice is cheap. It's what comes gift-wrapped that counts.
- I have never heard it put more beautifully.
- Thank you, Mr. Vandergelder.
Chocolate-covered peanuts. Unshelled.
They're the expensive kind.
- Why don't we open them in the workroom?
- I've come here today because I've important business to discuss with you, just as soon as Mrs. Levi says goodbye.
Pay no attention to me. I'm just browsing.
Business, Mr. Vandergelder?
The hay and feed business?
- Well, not exactly.
- A new hat shop in Yonkers?
I hear it's a very beautiful city and quite historic, according...
Yes, go on. Who's been telling you about Yonkers, may I ask?
Nobody. A friend.
What friend?
Well, you see, he...
- He?
- Yes, uh... he...
- H is name, Miss Molloy?
- What?
His name?
Oh, I believe it was... is...
Mr. Cornelius Hackl of Yonkers.
- Cornelius Hackl?
- Yes. Do you know him?
- He's my head clerk.
- He is?
He's been with me for ten years.
Where would you have known him?
Ah, just one of those chance meetings.
Yes, oh, yes, one of those chance meetings.
Chance meetings? Cornelius Hackl has no right to chance meetings. Where was it?
Really, it's very unlike you to question me in such a way.
Well, the truth might as well come out now as later.
Your head clerk is better known than you think.
Nonsense.
He's here all the time. He goes everywhere.
He's well-liked. Everybody knows Cornelius Hackl.
He never comes here. He works all day and then goes to sleep in the bran room at nine.
- So you think, but it's not true.
- Dolly Levi, you are mistaken.
Horace Vandergelder, you keep your nose so deep in your accounts you don't know what goes on.
By day, Cornelius Hackl is your faithful, trusted clerk, but by night... oh, by night...
He leads a double life, that is all.
Why, he is... why, he's... why, he's here... at the opera.
At the great restaurants, in all the fashionable homes.
He's even at the Harmonia Gardens three times a week.
The fact is, Mr. Vandergelder, he is the wittiest, the gayest, the naughtiest, most delightful man in New York City.
He's the famous Cornelius Hackl.
It ain't the same man. If I thought Cornelius
Hackl came to New York, I'd discharge him.
Who took the horses out of Jenny Lind's carriage and pulled her through the streets?
Who dressed up as a waiter and took an oyster and dropped it right down...?
- It's too wicked. I can't say it.
- Say it!
- No, but it was Cornelius Hackl.
- Where'd he get the money?
- Oh, he's very rich.
- Rich? I keep his money in my old safe.
He has $145. 36
Oh, you are killing me.
He is one of the Hackls.
- The Hackls?
- Yes, they built the Raritan Canal.
- Then why work for me?
- Well, I'll tell ya.
I don't wanna hear it. I have a headache. It ain't the same man.
He sleeps in my bran room.
I just made him my chief clerk.
If you had sense, you'd make him a partner.
Irene, I can see you're quite taken with him.
But I only met him once.
Now, don't you be thinking of marrying him.
- Darling, what are you saying?
- He breaks hearts like hickory nuts.
-  Who?
- Cornelius Hackl.
Miss Molloy, how long has he been calling on you?
Mr. Vandergelder, suppose I were to tell you that he has not been calling on me?
- Excuse me.
- Not now, Minnie.
- Aaagh!
- Stop singing.
- There's a man!
- That's not amusing.
And we don't wish to be interrupted.
Go back to the workroom immediately. Immediately.
- The poor dear is tired from overwork.
- If there's a man in there, we'll get him out!
- Whoever you are, come out of there!
- Do you realise what you're saying?
- I certainly do.
- Now just a minute.
Before you make another move or say another word that you might regret,
- allow me.
- Dolly.
Stand back.
There, you see? So much for this nonsense about that darling girl hiding a man in there.
I think we'll just forget you ever said it. It's forgotten.
Because there's nobody in there.
- Atchoo!
- God bless you.
Miss Molloy?
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder, there is a man in there.
- I see.
- There also happens to be an explanation.
For the present, I think I should just thank you for your visit and say good afternoon.
Atchoo!
- Another?
- Another.
Good Lord, the whole room is crawling with men. Irene, darling, congratulations.
Miss Molloy, I shan't trouble you again. And I hope vice versa.
Horace, where are you going?
To march in the 14th Street parade with the kind of people I can trust.
700 men.
Shut up!
Now.
- Have you met Miss Minnie Fay?
- Leave my shop or I'll call Officer Gogarty.
Irene, there's no fun in the jailhouse.
Everybody, don't talk at once.
- Just because you're rich...
- Don't deny it.
Doesn't mean you shouldn't make up for this.
- We'll do anything.
- This is Cornelius Hackl.
- We've already met. How do you do?
- Jail is absolutely out.
- Cornelius, explain to her.
- I'm Cornelius Hackl.
- It seems to me...
- Yes, the only way to make up for it...
Irene, send for the law at once.
You can have them put away for years on a charge like this.
Help, police! Only, have dinner with them first.
That's to show that you tried to settle amicably.
That's how to do it.
Dinner first, life imprisonment later.
It'll be a lovely evening. Who knows what'll happen before you send them off to jail?
- Mr. Hackl?
- Oh, by all means.
- It's what we had in mind all along.
- Minnie, we've been respectable for years.
Now we're in disgrace, we might as well make the most of it.
- It is the only sensible thing to do.
- Cornelius...
Now, I know a doughnut shop in the station.
Doughnut shop? Certainly not.
We want a fine dinner in a fashionable place.
And I know just the place.
The Harmonia Gardens on 14th Street.
- Your favourite restaurant.
- Wait a minute...
The finest food that money can buy and a lovely orchestra. A polka contest tonight.
- Ooh, dancing.
- Rudolph will give you the best table.
- We could never go there.
- It sounds marvellous.
Come, Minnie. We'll close the shop and take the whole afternoon off.
Oh, I mean, we could never...
Don't misunderstand me, it isn't the money or anything...
It's the... the...
What, Mr. Hackl?
It's the dancing. You see, I don't know how.
And they have contests at the Harmonia... whatever it is.
You said so yourself, and I don't know how.
It would take weeks, months, years to learn.
"Mrs. Dolly Levi. 28¾-year-old chief clerks taught how to d..."
Now, you just put one arm here and one arm there.
It's no use. I have no sense of rhythm.
Absolutely no sense of rhythm is the primary requirement for learning by the Levi method.
Just give me five minutes.
I'll have you dancing in the streets. the waltz kick turn.
Right foot, touch, left foot, touch, under, back, around, touch.
Back, through, around, behind.
Out, over... release... unfurl!
Oh, oh, that's just absolutely wonderful, Mr. Hackl.
When I think of the lucky women who'll find heaven in your arms!
I think we'll go back to lesson one, shall we?
Put your hand on her waist and stand, with her right in your left hand.
And...
One. That's right.
And one, two, three.
Ah!
One, two, three.
Oh, no. This one. And one, two, three.
One, two, three.
Look! I'm dancing!
- I was.
- Of course you were, Mr. Hackl.
Take the someone whose arms you're in
Hold on to her tight
And spin
And one, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
Look! I'm dancing!
Ah! Come here.
Turn around and turn around, try floating through the air
Can 't you be a little more aesthetic?
Don't you think my dancing has a polish and a flair?
The word I think I'd use is athletic.
Well, my heart is about to burst
My head is about to pop
And now that I'm dancing who cares if I ever stop?
That's wonderful.
Look, everybody!
I, Cornelius Hackl, sport, I'm dancing!
You're next, Mr. Tucker.
Glide and step
And then step and glide
And everyone stand aside!
Not... not yet, Mr. Tucker. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three, one...
- Look! He's dancing!
- I think he's holdin' out on us.
You could learn to polka if you worked a week or so
Or the tango filled with passion seething
I might join the chorus of the Castle Garden show
Whatever you do, Mr. Tucker, keep breathing.
For my heart is about to burst
My head is about to pop
And now that we're dancing who cares if we ever stop?
Oh.
When there's someone you hardly know
And wish you were closer to
Remember that he can be near to you while you're dancing
Though you've only just said hello
She's suddenly someone who can make all your daydreams appear to you
While you're dancing
Make the music weave a spell
Whirl away your worry
Things look almost twice as well
When they're slightly blurry
As around and around you go
Your spirits will hit the top
And now that we're dancing who cares if we ever stop?
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three
And now that we're dancing who cares if we ever stop?
Dolly!
Dolly, Cornelius is taking us to see the parade. Everyone will be marching.
- Come on, Mrs. Levi.
- Dolly, the world is full of wonderful things.
Hurry, before the parade passes by!
Yes, I will. I will.
Before the parade passes by.
Before it all moves on
And only I'm left
Before the parade passes by
I've got to get in step
While there's still time left
I'm ready to move out in front
Life without life has no reason or rhyme left
With the rest of them
With the best of them
I wanna hold my head up high
I need a goal again
I need a drive again
I wanna feel my heart coming alive again
Before the parade
Passes by
Ephraim, let me go.
It's been long enough, Ephraim.
Every night, just like you'd want me to, I've put out the cat, made myself a rum toddy, and, before I went to bed, said a little prayer thanking God that I was independent.
That no one else's life was mixed up with mine.
But lately, Ephraim,
I've begun to realise that for a long time I have not shed one tear.
Nor have I been for one moment outrageously happy.
Now, Horace Vandergelder, he's always saying the world is full of fools.
And in a way, he's right, isn't he?
I mean, himself, Cornelius, Irene, myself...
But there comes a time when you've got to decide if you want to be a fool among fools, or a fool alone.
Well, I have made that decision, Ephraim, but I would feel so much better about it if... if you could just give me a sign, any kind of a sign that you approve.
I'm going back, Ephraim.
I've decided to join the human race again.
And, Ephraim, I want you to give me away.
Before the parade passes by
I've got to go and taste Saturday's high life
Before the parade passes by
I've got to get some life back into my life
I'm ready to move out in front
I've had enough of just passing by life
With the rest of them
With the best of them
I can hold my head up high
For I've got a goal again
I've got a drive again
I'm gonna feel my heart coming alive again
Before the parade
Passes by
Waah! Waah!
Present arms!
Present arms!
Dolly Levi!
Hi!
Gussie Granger?
What are you doing here?
Earning an honest dollar, which is more than I've made on a legitimate stage in two years.
Pity on you. But the meat packers' float?
Ha! Listen, if there was more money in it, I'd play one of the pigs.
I came here for some privacy.
I owe you an apology and I didn't want to let it go another minute.
You owe me the fee I gave you for getting me tangled up with that collector of men's hats.
Yes, Irene, she was a disappointment, darling girl.
I'll have you know the confectioner gave me back every cent for the peanuts.
I'm sorry. I never give cash refunds.
However, being a woman who believes in giving service that's been paid for,
- I've arranged to make it up to you.
- Let me make one thing clear.
You have been discharged as my marriage broker. I have no use for one.
From now on, you are just a woman like anyone else.
- I am?
- And I'm just a man like anyone else, and, like anyone else, I'll do what I can to avoid the introductions you specialise in.
Well, I can understand your feelings, and I am here today, marching beside you, to assure you that there will be no further need for my services after dinner tonight.
- Dinner?
- 7. 30 at the Harmonia Gardens.
It's all arranged.
Private room. She'll be waiting.
- Who? Who-who-who'll be waiting?
- Who-who-who'll be waiting?
The very rich, very beautiful lady I referred to when I saw you in Yonkers this morning.
The heiress to a fortune, remember?
I'm not interested. What's her name?
Uh... Ernestina.
I'm not interested. What's her last name?
Simple... uh, Simple. Ernestina Simple.
- Can she cook?
- Can she cook?
Frankly, I never understood why a girl who could afford every servant around makes all her own meals, on a solid gold stove.
- She's a fool. I'm not interested in fools.
- Neither am I. Good day.
- Good day.
- Don't forget. 7. 30, Harmonia Gardens.
And rent some evening clothes. She's fussy.
Dolly Levi, you are a damned exasperating woman!
Why, Horace Vandergelder, that is the nicest thing you have ever said to me.
When the parade passes by
Listen and hear that brass harmony growing
When the parade passes by
Pardon me if my old spirit is showing
All of those lights over there
Seem to be telling me where I'm going
When the whistles blow
And the cymbals crash
And the sparklers light the sky
I'm gonna raise the roof
I'm gonna carry on
Give me an old trombone
Give me an old baton
Before the parade
Passes by
Cornelius, are you sure they're just changing their clothes?
- Don't worry, they'll be here.
- I get dressed in less than three minutes.
- Women wear more.
- They do?
Underneath.
Cornelius, maybe we should leave while there's time.
- Never.
- We've seen everything.
The parade, the Statue of Liberty, the stuffed whale at Barnum's museum.
- I could die a happy man now.
- It'll be worth it, no matter what happens.
The worst anybody can do is put us in jail.
But as long as we live we'll never forget the night we took Irene Molloy and
Minnie Fay to dinner at Harmonia Gardens,
- on less than a dollar.
- Cornelius, wake up.
And there's another reason we can't go back.
One more thing we promised to do before we go and turn into a couple of Vandergelders.
Cornelius! You're not thinking of kissing Miss Molloy?
- Maybe.
- She'll scream.
Barnaby, you don't know anything about women.
- Only that we can't afford 'em.
- You should know that everyone except us goes through life kissing right and left all the time.
They do?
Yes.
I often wondered about that.
- Smile, Barnaby.
- I'm smiling.
- Look rich and gay and charming.
- I'm looking gay and charming.
Hello.
- Here we are.
- Hello.
Cornelius.
Haa... I'm pleased to meet you, Miss Molloy.
No last names. After all we've been through together this afternoon, it's Irene and Minnie.
Irene.
- Ohh...
- Ohhh...
- Does that count, Cornelius?
- I don't think so.
Count?
You see, we were counting here, while we were waiting.
I hear all rich people do nothing but count their money.
I'm so hungry. Why don't we go in here and have some hors d'oeuvres first?
- No, no, no.
- It's very fashionable.
- It would spoil our appetites.
- Or we could have an apéritif.
It's out of the question. Barnaby and I don't agree with that sort of thing.
- But all those people do.
- Well, they simply don't know that a...
...a... péritif is no longer considered elegant.
- Oh, it isn't?
- Hasn't been for years.
In that case, it's on to Harmonia
Gardens for dinner. Call a hack.
- Hack?
- All my life I've wanted to ride in a hack.
- Oh, there's one. Yoo-hoo!
- No, no. We can't do that.
I mean, it isn't the money or anything it's just that, nowadays, really elegant people never take hacks.
- Hacks is out.
- They all go by streetcar.
Then, by all means, we go by streetcar.
I've been elegant all my life and I never knew it.
Of course, if you really want to be really elegant...
- Oh, we do.
- We do.
You'll walk.
Yes, New York
Barnaby and Cornelius
All the guests of Mr. Hackl are feeling great and look spectacular
What a knack
There is to that acting like a born aristocrat
We got elegance
If you ain't got elegance
You can never, ever carry it off
All who are well-bred agree
Minnie Fay has pedigree
Exercise your wildest whims tonight
We are out with Diamond Jims tonight
Could they be misleading us?
Silver spoons were used for feeding us
We got elegance
If you ain't got elegance
You can never, ever carry it off
Snobs that slobs
Throw roses at. We look down
Our noses at
Pity all the other girls around
When I swing my perfect pearls around
Snubbing folks is chic to us
Sometimes we don't even speak to us
If you ain't got elegance
You can never, ever carry it off
If you please.
Middle class don't speak of it
Savoir-faire, we reek of it
Some were born with rags and patches
But we use dollar bills for matches and
Vanderbilt kowtows to us
JP Morgan scrapes and bows to us
We got elegance
We were born with elegance
I behave like Walter Raleigh
When the streets are full of mud
And the bluest huckleberry
Isn't bluer than my blood
Have you noticed when I hold my cup
The saucer never moves
And the way I keep my pinkie up
Indubitably proves that
We got elegance
We got built-in elegance
And with elegance
Elegance, elegance, elegance
Elegance
We'll carry it off
Horace, Horace Vandergelder
Mrs. Horace Vandergelder
Just leave everything to me
Though it won't be like the first time
How can it be like the first time?
But why does it have to be?
Don't look for shooting stars
For love is only love
You touch, and still you touch the ground
Don't listen for those bells
For love is only love
And if it's love you've found
Your heart won't hear a sound
And when you hold his hand
You only hold his hand
The violins are all a bluff
But if you're really wise
The silence of his eyes
Will tell you love is only love
And it's wonderful enough
Without the shooting stars
Without the sound of bells
Without the violins
Love is wonderful
Enough
Good evening. Good evening.
Straighten up. Walk erect.
Pleasure. Good evening.
How nice to see you.
Psst! No expression. Let the food smile.
And how are you this evening?
Charming, charming.
You! You there!
Come up here at once.
Yes, you.
How dare you keep me standing here this long?
As soon as Mr. Vandergelder arrives, you will be seated, Miss Simple.
Now look here, garçon.
My name is Rudolph. Rudolph Reisenweber.
And why, may I ask, can I not wait at the table?
Please. Please.
Harmonia Gardens does not consider it proper, a lady alone.
- Perhaps if you'll let me take your wrap.
- Ohh! Don't touch me.
Where?
- If you will excuse me.
- Certainly not.
Yes? What can I do for you?
How are ya, Adolf? How's my old friend?
- I am Rudolph.
- Oh, of course.
Rudolph.
We'd like a little something to eat. You know?
In what name is the reservation, please?
- Reservation?
- I'm afraid there is nothing available.
- Come on, let's go.
- Do you know who he is?
This is Cornelius Hackl. The Cornelius Hackl.
- Tell him about the Rockefellers.
- The Rockefellers? I see.
Look, I know a little place up the block.
I think I have something. Yes, I think
I have something. Follow me, if you will.
Dining room number two.
- It is the last one. Very private.
- It is?
- Very exclusive.
- It is?
- Very fashionable.
- Don't say another word.
And very expensive.
That was the word.
- How beautiful!
- How elegant!
How much?
Cornelius, I thought you said everyone knew you.
Oh, don't worry. They will after tonight.
She is? She is? I don't believe it!
Eight o'clock, table for two, and a chicken.
Mrs. Dolly Levi coming here after such a long absence!
It is too happy to be true.
That's the message she told me to give you.
Who? Who are these people?
They look truthful.
If you're gonna spend all evening acting like a scared rabbit, maybe I'll order lettuce.
Oh, how can you be so brave? It's unfair.
Just try to keep remembering
Mrs. Levi's advice.
I only wanted to marry you, not perform in public.
- There's nobody here who knows us.
- Oh, Ambrose, are you sure?
Sweetheart, have I ever been wrong?
Sir?
- Vandergelder's the name.
- Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.
There's a Miss Ernestina Simple supposed to be waiting.
Right there, Mr. Vandergelder.
No, you didn't understand what I said...
But perfectly. Mr. Vandergelder is here, Miss Simple.
Yes, so I see.
- Oh, good evening, Miss Simple.
- I hope so, Mr. Vandergelder.
- All right, my good man.
- Fritz, private dining room number one.
- Follow me, if you will.
- You may take my arm.
And, unless you are suffering from a head cold, kindly remove your hat.
Achtung!
I have an important announcement to make.
After an absence of several years, there will return to the Harmonia Gardens tonight the lady who always had the happiest smile, the warmest heart, and the largest appetite in the city of New York.
- It's Dolly.
- Dolly?
- Dolly!
-  Dolly! Dolly! Dolly! Dolly! Dolly!
Attention!
It is therefore my order, as head waiter of the Harmonia Gardens, and your supreme commander, that tonight of all nights our usual lightning service will be twice as lightning as ever.
Or else!
Waiter, write this down. Mock turtle soup, roast pheasant under glass.
- Pheasant?
- I'll have the same, and some champagne.
- Champagne?
- What would you like, sir?
Six months off for good behaviour?
What do you mean,
"oysters aren't in season"?
Anybody can have oysters in season.
I want them out of season.
They don't have any, Miss Simple.
Then tell 'em to go out and dig for some.
Oh!
- Hello again.
- Here we are.
- We thought something happened.
- Don't worry. It will.
Barnaby, Irene, Minnie,
I feel so good about everything, so good about this whole day, that I am now going to become an honest man and tell the truth.
Cornelius?
I'd forgotten what strange things happen to men when they drink.
If I tell you the truth, will you let me put my arm around your waist?
Good heavens! You can do that even if you lie to me.
I've never touched a woman before.
You still haven't. That's my corset.
- You're a wonderful person, Irene.
- Thank you, Cornelius.
And that's why I have to tell you the truth.
If it'll make you feel better.
It's all those fancy things that Mrs. Levi said about me.
Oh, yes.
Well, they're just not so.
Indeed?
Irene, I'm not rich.
Not rich?
I'm not any of the things
Mrs. Levi said I was.
And neither is Barnaby. We're not sports, we don't know anybody.
We never come to New York.
We never do anything except work for Mr. Vandergelder all day and clean up the store at night.
And we wanted so much to have one day of adventure, that we ran away from Yonkers and told a lot of lies.
Ah, well, look at us.
A pair of penniless pretenders.
But, Cornelius, I've known that all along.
You have?
Why else would you have hidden in my cupboard and under my table?
And made us walk all over New York?
You're the nicest ladies a man ever went to jail for.
Jail?
We don't have the money to pay for this dinner.
Of course you don't. Minnie, show these two sports what I've got in my purse.
What a pleasure to know that selling all those silly hats can pay for an evening as delightful as this one.
I can't help myself.
Wow!
I...
No, no, Minnie, my white handbag, not that one.
- My white handbag.
- When we changed for the evening.
Minnie...
Only my mad money... a nickel for the horsecar.
Would you like your check now, sir?
Take this away, my good man.
Bring us another bottle of champagne.
- What's this? What are you doing?
- It's eight o'clock. I really must be going.
Going? You haven't finished your dinner yet, Miss Simple.
That's expensive.
If I had food like that every night,
I'd be out of business inside a year.
I suggest you have the waiter put it in a bag and take it home to your horses and pigs.
I don't have pigs, Miss Simple,
I have chickens, and I did not get them by being extravagant.
I see no point in this trivial discussion, Mr. Vandergelder, nor in my remaining here any longer, inasmuch as it is quite clear to me that you are, if you forgive the expression,
- entirely unsuitable.
- Unsuitable?
Nevertheless, I will never say a word to
Mrs. Levi about this unfortunate evening.
And I suggest you do likewise when she arrives here.
Wait a minute.
Did you say "arrives here"?
Yes, she planned to join us at eight.
You may say I left because I felt sick to my stomach.
It's quite true, you know.
Good night.
Any man who goes to a big city deserves what happens to him.
- He's all yours, honey.
- Good. Mr. Cassidy?
- Yes, Mrs. Levi?
- It's all right now. You can let me out.
Whoa.
- Mr. Reisenweber, come here! Hurry!
- How often have I told you not to shout?
- It's her. She's outside.
- You mean...?
- What's going on?
- Are you sure?
I know that voice. I heard her.
In a beautiful carriage with two horses.
- That's her. She's come.
- Who? Who's come?
A lady. You wouldn't know her. Mrs. Levi.
- Is it true?
- Yes, it's Dolly. Tell the men to get ready.
- You saw her?
- In a long carriage pulled by four horses.
It's like old times.
Reisenweber. Rudolph!
Rudy!
She is here.
Hello, Rudy
Well, hello, Harry
It's so nice to be back home where I belong
You are lookin' swell, Manny
I can tell, Danny
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still
Mmm.
Goin' strong
I feel the room swayin'
For the band's playin'
One of my old favourite songs from way back when
So
Bridge that gap, fellas
Find me an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again
Hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly

You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong

For the band's playin'
One of your old favourite songs from way back when
So
Here's my hat, fellas
I'm stayin' where I'm at, fellas
Promise you'll never go away again
I went away from the lights of 14th Street
And into my personal haze
But now that I'm back in the lights of 14th Street
Tomorrow will be brighter than the good old days
Those good old days
Tell it to me sweet
Hello! Well, hello, Dolly
Well, hello! Hey, look! Here's Dolly
Glad to see you, Hank, let's thank my lucky star
Your lucky star
You're lookin' great, Stanley
Lose some weight?
I think, I think you did, Stanley
Dolly's overjoyed and overwhelmed and...
Over par
I hear the ice
Do you hear the ice tinkle?
See the lights
Can you see the light twinkle?
And you still get glances from us handsome men
Look at you all, you're all so handsome
Golly, gee, fellas
Find me an empty knee, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again
Well, hello
Look who's here.
Dolly
This is Louis
Hello, Louis.
Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
I am so glad to be back.
Ah, you're lookin' swell
Thank you, Louis.
Dolly
I can tell
Does it show?
Dolly
You still glowin', you still crowin'
You still goin' strong
I feel the room swayin'
And the band playin'
One of our old favourite songs from way back when
I remember it
- So
- It was my favourite
Show some snap, fellas
Find her an empty lap, yeah
Dolly'll never go away again
Well, well, hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
We can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong
I hear the ice
I hear it tinkle
See the lights
I see them twinkle
And you still get glances from us handsome men
So
Mmm, wow, wow, wow, fellas
Look at the old girl now, fellas
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away again
One more time!
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never...
Horace Vandergelder.
- Do we know each other?
- Much too well.
Oh, it's you, Mrs. Levi.
Yes.
Well, do you, uh...?
Do you think you have the figure for that sort of get-up?
That's for others to say, Mr. Vandergelder.
I bought it from a friend, not being a rich lady who has nothing better to do than dilly-dally with seamstresses.
- Which reminds me. Where is Miss Simple?
- Miss Simple? Well, she had to... uh... uh...
She got called away by a sick friend. Had to leave.
Oh. Well, that's Ernestina.
Always thinking of other people.
We'll just have to make do without her for the time being. Rudolph?
My dear Mrs. Levi, I have saved the very best table for you.
- How I've missed you.
- This way, please.
- Come along.
- I've eaten.
Don't stand here, you'll get run over by a waiter. Oh, hello. Good evening.
Oh, hello. How are you?
Hi, nice to see you.
- You know too many people.
- Total strangers.
- So why greet them?
- It feels good to have so many friends.
- Well, say hello for me too.
- I already did.
- Lovely, Rudolph. Perfect.
- What are we doing down here?
There's someone in the dance competition I want you to see.
- I have no interest in dancing.
- Rudy, this is Mr. Vandergelder of Yonkers.
In fact, Yonkers' most influential citizen.
And Mr. Vandergelder insists on buying the finest dinner you have and served promptly.
- I never said that.
- I'm watching my waist. Can't eat a thing.
- What's ready immediately?
- You ordered a chicken...
I couldn't face a chicken.
Not after all I've been through today.
- Good, cancel the chicken.
- And bring a turkey.
- Yes.
- With everything on the side.
Now, tell me about you and Ernestina.
I can't wait to hear.
It was short, but was it sweet?
I mean, do you think you and she...?
I mean, did it go well?
Mrs. Levi, you've a habit of asking very personal questions.
Mr. Vandergelder, if you're thinking of marriage, you might as well learn that you have to let women be women.
Now, tell me, did you like her?
Did she like you?
Always putting your nose into other people's affairs.
Anybody who lived with you would get as nervous as a cat.
- What did you say?
- Anybody who lived with you...
Horace Vandergelder, you get that idea right out of your head this minute.
Why, the idea of you even mentioning such a thing.
Understand once and for all that
I have no intention of marrying you.
- I didn't mean that.
- You've been hinting around for some time.
- I have not.
- So put that right out of your head.
- Stop saying that. That's not what I meant.
- I should hope not.
You go your way and I'll go mine.
I am not some Irene Molloy whose head you can turn with chocolate peanuts. Unshelled.
- The idea of you suggesting it.
- You misunderstood me.
I certainly hope so. Let's not discuss it any more. Here's our food.
- I don't feel well.
- I'll serve Mr. Vandergelder.
Here is a lovely, a lovely wing, for you.
And some dumplings.
Oh, lighter than air, they are.
- That's what I need, some air.
- And some giblets.
Very, very tender and very good for you.
No, as I said before, you go your way and I'll go mine.
Here, have some wine, you'll feel better.
Since you brought it up, there's one thing I oughta say...
- I didn't bring it up.
- before we forget about it.
It's true, I like to manage things, but not anything as disorderly as your household.
As out of control, as untidy. Oh, no,
Horace, you can do that for yourself.
- It is not out of control.
- Let's not say another word.
- Oh, have some beets.
- I'm not hungry and I don't like beets.
No, a complaining, quarrelsome, friendless soul like you is no sort of companion for me.
You salt your beets and I'll salt mine.
I won't say another word.
Besides, I'm not those things you said I am.
You're the only person that knows it.
No, Horace, I have decided to enjoy life.
You can find a housekeeper who'll cook for a dollar a day.
It can be done, if you like cold baked beans. I can see you now, ending your days listening at keyholes for fear of being cheated.
- Have some more beets. They're delicious.
- I hate beets.
There, that's the difference between us.
I'd be nagging you, to get some spirit into you, and the pity of it is you could be a charming, amiable man if you wanted to.
- I don't want to be charming.
- But you are. You can't help yourself.
Listening at keyholes! You have no right to say such things.
At your age you ought to enjoy the truth.
My age, you're always talking about my age.
I don't know what your age is, but with bad temper you'll double it in six months.
Now siddown. Before we change the subject, there's one thing I'll say.
I don't wanna hear it. You're wasting your time. I have no intention of proposing.
Oh! I suppose you want me to ask you?
Well, I'm sorry. I'm turning you down.
How can you turn me down when I haven't asked ya anything?
It's no use arguing. I've made up your mind.
Here, let me cut your wings.
- I don't want my wings cut.
- No man does, Horace. No man does.
I've got a headache. I'm leaving.
Oh, no, the dance competition is about to begin.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention please.
It is my pleasure to announce on behalf of the management of the Harmonia Gardens, that our dance contest is about to commence.
The judges for tonight's competition are Mr. Hermann Fleishacker,
Mr. Llewellyn Codd, and our special guest-of-honour judge, Mrs. Dolly Levi.
Siddown!
Ladies and gentlemen who wish to participate, will you please come to the dance floor.
To the lucky winning couple goes the grand prize of 50 silver dollars or an engagement at the Harmonia Gardens.
Everybody, dance!
- Your check, sir.
- Another bottle of champagne.
Mm! Look at him. What grace, what talent, what a living he could earn with his feet!
- Horace, look.
- Where?
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, isn't he wonderful?
That's Ambrose Kemper, so-called artist.
- Why, so it is.
- No wonder his pictures are so awful.
- He must paint with his feet.
- He's sure to win first prize.
Ermengarde should see him now, dancing with another girl.
- And such a pretty little thing too.
- It's shameful, that's what it is. Shameful.
Look, there's that Molloy woman dancing with a man.
I think it's a man.
And only a few hours ago she was waiting for me to propose.
- Shocking.
- No faithfulness left in this world.
I agree. I certainly do. And it's very selfish that people like us don't jump right up and marry someone just to set the world a good example.
My hat!
Ermengarde!
- Uncle...
- My niece!
Agh!
You are a disgrace to Yonkers!
Grrrr!
- Mr. Vandergelder, the contest!
- I'll show you a contest!
Call the police!
Uncle Horace, we can explain.
Exp...? I'll give you...
Cornelius Hackl!
- What are you doing in New York?
- Delivering some oats.
Oats? With my former intended?
- You're discharged!
- You can't fire me. I quit.
So do I.
- And you're discharged!
- You can't fire me. I quit.
So do I.
I'm sorry.
Grrr!
Oh!
Horace Vandergelder, flat on your back you are still charming.
Cornelius, Barnaby, perhaps there's a way I can get
Mr. Vandergelder to give you back your jobs.
What? How?
I could become his wife.
- No, that's impossible.
- It is?
- Yes.
- But why, Cornelius?
- Because. That's why.
- But you have to give me a reason.
Never mind the reason. Never mind the reason! And don't tell me to shush!
- What's going on there?
- Cornelius, quick!
Hey, you! What's all this noise?
What's happening here?
- Now, you stay out of this.
- Are you all right, Miss?
- I'll let you know.
- Young man...
I'm only trying to tell her something.
Well, it's too late and you're disturbing the peace.
No, it's not too late.
That's why I'm shouting.
For 28 years, my whole life,
I never did anything.
I just worked, took orders, never went anywhere. Stayed in Yonkers.
- Yonkers?
- And today the most important thing that can happen to a man, and might never have happened, happened to me because I left Yonkers and came to New York and met this lady.
Met her this afternoon.
Mister... just what are you talking about?
Officer, I'm talking about none other than love.
-  Love?
- Love?
Young man, are you trying to tell me that after 28 years in Yonkers you've fallen in love with this young lady in one day?
Oh, no, Officer, I didn't fall in love with
Miss Irene Molloy of this city in just a day.
It was much quicker than that. An hour.
No, even that's too long.
What's less than a minute?
- A second?
- Less than that.
- A moment.
- That's it.
That is it. Now, all of you, listen to me.
Please.
It only takes a moment
For your eyes to meet, and then
Your heart knows
In a moment
You will never be alone again
I held her
For an instant
But my arms felt sure and strong
It only takes a moment
To be loved
A whole life long
Isn't the world full of wonderful things?
I have lost so many things.
My job, my future, everything that people think is important, but I don't care. Cos, even if I have to dig ditches for the rest of my life,
I shall be a ditch-digger who once had a wonderful day.
Mister, do you mind?
I came in late. Right after...
It only...
Takes a moment
But his arms felt sure and strong
It only takes a moment
He held me, for an instant
But his arms felt safe and strong
It only takes a moment
To be loved a whole life long
And that is all
That love's about
And we'll recall
When time runs out
That it only
Took a moment
To be loved a whole life long
Tell Rudolph not to worry about the damage.
Just send the bill to Vandergelder's
Hay and Feed Store, Yonkers, New York.
- There's your life for you.
- I don't want to hear about it.
Without niece, without bride, without clerks.
Look, I'm tired. I've got a backache.
- That's all you have. I hope you're satisfied.
- Never mind.
There's only one thing for me to say.
I've been meaning to say it all night.
If it's to ask me to marry you, Dolly Levi, never - not in a million years.
It wasn't that at all, Horace.
All I wanted to say was...
Goodbye
What?
Goodbye
What are you talking about?
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
- Nonsense.
- Don't try to stop me, Horace, please.
Wave your little hand and whisper "So long, dearie"
You ain't gonna see me any more
And when you discover that your life is dreary
Don ' t you come a-knockin' at my door
Cos I'll be all dolled up and singin' that song
That says "You dog, I told you so"
So wave your little hand and whisper "So long, dearie"
Dearie should have said "So long" so long ago
Because you treated me so rotten and rough
I have had enough of feeling low
So wave your little hand and whisper "So long, dearie"
Dearie should have said "So long" so long ago
For I can hear that choo-choo calling me on to a fancy new address
Yes, I can hear that choo-choo calling me on, on board that Happiness Express
I'm gonna learn to dance and drink and smoke a cigarette
I'm going as far away from Yonkers as a girl can get
So
And on those cold winter nights, Horace,
you can snuggle up to your cash register.
It's a little lumpy, but it rings.
Don't come a-knockin', I'll be all dolled up and singin' that song
That says "You dog, I told you so"
So, Horace, you will find your life a sad old story
You'll be living in that lonesome territory
When you see old Dolly shuffle off to glory
Oh, I should have said "So long"
How could I have been wrong?
Oh, I should have said "So long"
So long ago
Quiet! Quiet, down there, you little monsters.
Cornelius! Barnaby!
D'ya hear me down there?
Ermengarde!
What the devil is this?
What's this chicken mash doing all over?
Cornelius! Barnaby!
Get up here this minute and clean up this mess.
Well, good riddance. Didn't need you before and I don't need you now.
Ermengarde! I'm ready for my breakfast!
I want three eggs with crisp bacon, and hot porridge with cream, and grits...
It's not fair.
It's worse than that. It's lonely.
Not in a million years, Dolly Levi.
You go your way and I'll go mine.
- Good morning, Uncle Horace.
- Good morning, Mr. Vandergelder.
Oh, come crawling back, have you?
I've a good mind not to take you, but as I'm so softhearted go get your aprons and start cleaning up this mess.
We're not coming back to work for you.
What?
Barnaby and I are stopping by for our money.
You see, we've decided to go into business.
Business?
And since the only business we know is hay and feed, we're opening our own store.
Mrs. Levi's found the perfect location for us.
- Right across the street from you.
- She wouldn't dare.
Hackl and Tucker Incorporated.
H uh! You'll last for a week.
- What about my breakfast?
- Uncle Horace,
I think you'd better start learning how to make it yourself.
All right, all right. My conscience is clear.
A man can do only so much to keep fools from their own natural folly.
Why, Horace Vandergelder, as I live and breathe, how well you look today.
I just came by to return your cane, so don't let me interrupt.
You were doing something?
What were you doing?
We were getting their money.
- Plus $6. 12 of mine.
- And the money my mama left me.
That's right. $52.48.
- 38, idiot.
- 48... Uncle.
All right, all right. If all you can think about at a time like this is money, the safe is upstairs.
And I have the combination.
- You stay here.
- If you insist, Horace.
Ephraim Levi, I'm gonna get married again.
I'm gonna marry Horace Vandergelder.
And I'm asking your permission.
It won't be a marriage in the sense that we had one, but I shall certainly make him happy.
You can be sure of that.
I am going to marry Horace Vandergelder and send his money out into the world, doing all the things you taught me.
As you always used to say, Ephraim:
"Money, pardon the expression, is like manure."
"It's not worth a thing unless it's spread around, encouraging young things to grow."
Anyhow, that's the opinion of the future Mrs. Vandergelder.
And, Ephraim, I'm still waiting for that sign that you approve.
- Mr. Vandergelder.
- Outside. Front and back.
Bossy, scheming, meddling, irritating, inquisitive, exasperating.
Horace, I know you're no longer interested, but I have found you the ideal wife.
Dolly Levi, I don't want you to find me any ideal wife.
If I want an ideal wife,
I'll find one of my own, and I have found her and it's you, damn it!
I know I've been a fool and I probably always will be, but Dolly, forgive me and marry me.
No, Horace, I...
- I don't dare. I don't dare.
- What do you mean?
Well, you know as well as I do that you're the first citizen of Yonkers and your wife would have to be a... a somebody.
You are! You are a wonderful woman.
Yes, but, uh, do you really think I have it in me... to forgo fancy clothes and expensive jewels, and instead be a benefactress to half the town?
In other words, to be a credit to you?
Dolly, everybody knows that you could do anything you wanted to do.
By the way, Horace, here's the money
I borrowed from you yesterday.
Keep it, keep it.
Oh, Horace.
I never thought I'd ever hear you say anything like that.
You know it's bad business to let 'em open a store over there?
- It was your idea.
- Let him be your partner.
And Barnaby can have Cornelius's old job.
That way we can all dance at Ermengarde's wedding.
That does it. You've gone too far. I'll dance at no wedding. Besides, I don't know how.
- All right, I'll dance.
- Excuse me, Mr. Vandergelder.
- I said outside! Now get moving.
- Horace, what is going on around here?
Oh, nothing, I just thought I'd have the shutters done over in forest green.
- Forest-green shutters?
- The paint's still good, but that fellow's just set up a business and needs a good start.
You see, Dolly, I've always felt that money, pardon the expression, is like manure.
It's not worth a thing unless it's spread around, encouraging young things to grow.
Thank you, Ephraim.
Hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you here where you belong
I never knew, Dolly
Without you, Dolly
Life was awfully flat and, more than that, was awfully wrong
Here's my hat, Horace
I'm stayin' where I'm at, Horace
Dolly'll never go away
Wonderful woman.
Again
Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
That you feel as fine as you look
Take the someone whose arms you're in
Hold on to her tight and spin
And one, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three, look!
I held her
For an instant
But my arms felt sure and strong
It only takes a moment
To be loved a whole life long
Yes, it takes a woman
A dainty woman
A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife
Oh, yes, it takes a woman
A fragile woman
To bring you the sweet things in life
Well, well, hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
We can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong
Just see the crowd swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of your old favourite songs from way back when
So
Wow, wow, wow, fellas
Look at the old girl now, fellas
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away
Again
Okay. You're on, girls.
Is it true you're leaving us for Belgium, Guy?
Yep. Leaving tomorrow night.
- Oh, boo-hoo!
- Oh, boo-hoo!
"Boo-hoo"?
Thas a good title for a song.
Do you happen to have a light?
- Is there anything else I can do for you?
- You can sit down.
Thank you.
- Have you been here before, Miss...?
- Claire. Claire Dunham.
I've been here every night since you opened, but you haven't seen me till now.
I can't understand that.
Perhaps you've been too busy with that pretty little girlfriend.
Oh, there's nothing wrong with your eyesight, is there?
- Are you in love with her?
- Would it break your heart?
Oh, shatter it to pieces.
And look, there isn't an ounce of sympathy in your eyes.
There isn't an ounce of sincerity in yours.
Guy?
- You going to stay around for a while?
- Of course. She may not turn up tonight.
- Your lighter.
- Thank you.
- What do you want?
- Must be the maternal instinct.
- What?
- That you bring out in chicks.
Little mothers can't leave you alone.
What are you complaining about?
You're married.
- Thas what I'm complaining about.
- Georgie, you don't pop the big question...
...they can't give the big answer.
- It can't be that easy. I never proposed...
...yet I got a wife and three kids and a grabbing ulcer.
- Maybe she won't turn up.
- Who, Jill?
- Whatever her name is.
- Thas the only name I know.
I can't get a thing out of her.
- Or anywhere with her.
- Drink your milk.
She's holding out for a ring on her finger...
...and the one in your nose.
It won't be long now, my friend.
I see an ulcer in your future.
Look, pal, when we get to Bruges,
I'll still be as free as a bird.
A canary's a bird.
So?
Ever see one that wasn't locked up?
Les go to work, partner.
Hi.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- You're very pretty.
- Thank you.
- Les do something different tonight.
- We've never done anything.
- I was wondering if you noticed that.
- I noticed.
Well, is my last night here.
Do we make the most of it, or do you disappear as usual?
I suppose if anything's to become of us, ill have to be tonight.
Thas exactly the way I feel.
You've had so many women in your life.
I haven't looked at another woman since the first night you came into the club.
But they're still looking at you.
I don't even know her.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Who is she?
A music lover.
- Thas nice.
- You are beautiful.
And you're the most wonderful thing in my life.
Come on. I'm gonna put you in a cab and send you straight home.
Home? But I don't want to go home.
I want to go with you to your flat.
I tried.
And so after Mommy and Daddy died,
I went to live with Uncle Gerald.
He has a lovely home in the country, and he lived all by himself.
He's been looking after me ever since.
You'd love Uncle Gerald, Guy.
- Oh, I'm sure I would.
- He's a lamb.
You don't mind me tidying up, do you?
Not a bit.
I love doing things for you.
Tea's ready.
- Do you take milk in your tea?
- No milk in the tea.
Have you any bikkies?
"Bikkies"? Not that I know of.
Biscuits, silly.
No bikkies, silly.
Oh, dear. I suppose I'm chattering away, but this is the first time...
...we've really had a chance to talk.
- And talk and talk and talk.
- Guy?
- Yes?
Would you put something on the record player?
What a time to dance.
Why not?
Okay, there's something on the record player.
There we are.
Oh, I forgot the sugar.
Jill, you're flitting around like a butterfly.
Why don't you light somewhere?
Like here.
Ain't that better?
Don't you just love us like this?
You all cozy and relaxed, and me pouring your tea...
...and doing things for you.
- You could do a lot more if...
- Let me prop those pillows.
- I don't want them propped.
- There. Comfy? Cozy?
- Comfy, cozy.
Better?
Jill, hold still just for a minute.
- What for?
- For this.
Oh, Guy. Our first kiss.
I knew it would be like that, all shivers and goose bumps.
- One or two?
- What?
Lumps in your tea, silly.
Four hundred eighteen.
I couldn't care less.
Is marvelous being with you.
I can't believe this is happening.
I can't believe it either.
- Guy?
- Yes?
Would you kiss me again?
Are you sure I wouldn't be interrupting anything?
I'm sure.
Oh, isn't that lovely?
- It could have been.
- The music. The song.
Don't you remember, darling?
You said it was our song.
I did?
I did.
Sing it to me.
- Sing at a time like this?
- Please.
You've no idea what your singing does to me.
Well, Jill...
Jill?
- Jill!
- Oh, I must have dozed off.
You did.
Oh, Guy, I do love you.
- Aren't you going to say it back?
- Sure.
Say it, Guy.
Okay. I love you.
I'm crazy about you.
I'm nuts about you. I'm mad about you, absolutely mad about you.
- I just sat on the tea service.
- Yes, I know.
Cups of hot tea are spilling all over.
Yes, I know.
It won't take a minute to change.
- Guy, is terribly late.
- I won't be long.
- I'm copying down your telephone number.
- Help yourself.
- I'll give you a ring tomorrow, all right?
- Anytime.
I love you.
"I'll ring you up tomorrow, all right?"
Thas what you think.
If I never see you again, ill be too soon for me.
B6?
I do believe I've made a mistake.
Oh, well. From the looks of him, he probably deserved it anyway.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello?
Hello... Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here. Where are you?
- Hello. Hello?
- Hello?
- Mr. Lambert?
- Yes.
- Well, this is Gerald Waverly.
- Does my name mean anything to you?
- Not a thing.
Well, then, apparently I've been as much of a secret to you as you've been to me.
Jillian Conway is my niece.
Jillian Conway? I don't know a...
Jill? Then you must be Uncle Gerald.
Well, I bear that distinction, yes.
Mr. Lambert,
I think is high time we met.
- I agree.
- This afternoon, then?
Three-Eleven Surrey Road,
St. John's Wood. Around 2-ish?
- Around 2-ish.
- Goodbye, Mr. Lambert.
Goodbye.
Very nice.
- Is a Constable.
- Yeah, I know.
- How did you know?
- Is written right here on the bottom.
Well, do sit down, Mr. Lambert.
Would you like some tea?
No, thanks. Where's Jill?
She's here, but she doesn't know you are.
- Would you mind telling her I'm here?
- You're an entertainer, I believe.
Rather an uncertain life, I should think.
Is not like steady employment, is it?
Well, we're not all on relief.
I assure you, it wasn't my intention to offend.
I'm not offended, I'm in a hurry. I don't want to lose my place in the bread line.
Did you have it in mind to marry my niece, Mr. Lambert?
Is been nice. I can find my own way out.
- Just a minute, please.
- Look, I'm over 21.
No criminal record. No hint of insanity.
I want to marry her, forgive me if I don't consult you.
- Has Jillian told you about her inheritance?
- We had other things to talk about.
Knowing her as I do,
I can safely assume...
...she's told you nothing about herself at all...
...other than she fancies she's in love.
- Well...
...sometimes thas all one needs to know.
Perhaps, but not in this case.
Uncle Gerald?
In here, Jillian.
Uncle Gerald, l...
Guy!
If you'll excuse me...
You're putting me on.
You're not putting me on.
It looks worse than it is, Guy.
I'll be 18 in four days.
Happy birthday. I'll send you a card.
- You didn't think I was a child last night.
- You didn't look like that last night.
All thas changed are my clothes.
I'm still the same girl.
I'm not the same fella.
- I love you, Guy.
- Love? What could you know about love?
Here.
Look, this is where you belong...
...in houses like this with Uncle Gerald...
...and Constable over there.
Can't I even call you?
No. I'm taking the boat train to Belgium tonight.
Oh, Guy.
- Leaving so soon, Mr. Lambert?
- Now, with your permission, of course.
How long have you been spying on me, Uncle Gerald?
Spying?
How else could you have known about Guy? And I trusted you.
I trusted you, until I discovered you were slipping out...
...when you shoulve been asleep.
- You needn't make it sound so sordid.
I want to marry him.
Marriage. You're only 17.
Oh, how I hate that number.
Well, in four more days, I'll be 18.
Well, being 18 still isn't old enough to marry without my consent.
You're too young to even contemplate such a thing.
A few more years of the proper schooling should help.
- School?
- Is all arranged. I have your ticket here.
You're shipping me off like some convict to Devil's Island.
Actually, it could be a wonderful experience.
Brussels should be lovely this time of year.
Brussels? Brussels is in Belgium, isn't it, Uncle Gerald?
Unless they've moved it, yes.
- You'll take the boat train tonight.
- Yes, Uncle Gerald.
Georgie!
Georgie!
- What are you doing out there?
- Trying to turn the ship around.
- Oh, I thought you had an accident.
- Pull me in!
Oh, I'm just a million laughs, right?
I ought to shove that smile right down your throat.
- Just not my day.
- It ain't your night, either.
- I just saw Jill on the boat.
- You're crazy. She couldn't be.
Or could she?
Jill!
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
- Time is running out, Archie.
- I still don't like it, Arthur. Too risky.
Risky? Yes, but not for us.
We pick an unlikely-looking suitcase...
...and let somebody else carry it through customs.
- All right. Give it a go, but be careful.
- Careful, right.
I say, I'm terribly sorry, gentlemen.
Not like that, you silly twit.
- Casual.
- Casual.
Actually, this is a holiday for me, with a little work thrown in.
I'm doing a thesis on the historical backgrounds of European cities.
How interesting.
- So I noticed.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Would you like me to help look for him?
- Is no use.
I've been over the boat from top to bottom. I'll catch up with him in Bruges.
- Is that where you're going?
- We're going to marry.
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.
Georgie? Georgie! Not a sign of her.
- You sure it was Jill you saw?
- Positive.
- Les set up.
- Have a heart. I don't feel like playing.
- Got something better to do?
- I'm going to the railing.
Wait a minute. First we play.
- Lf Jill's on board, she'll find us.
- And then what?
Then we'll both go to the railing.
Oh, sorry, governor.
Casual, you nit.
But thas barbaric, uncivilized.
I agree. Nevertheless, without parental consent...
...forget about being married in Belgium until you're 21.
Thas downright immoral.
- Too bad you're not going to Stockholm.
- Stockholm?
Sweden's lovely this time of year...
...particularly for an 18-year-old girl with marriage on her mind.
- Thas him.
- Who?
Him! Excuse me. Thank you.
Thanks for everything. Excuse me.
All right!
Guy.
School's out. You just rang the bell.
You were right.
- I thought we settled everything.
- We did.
- Then why are you here?
- I'm on my way to Brussels.
To Brussels? Not Bruges?
- Would you like to see my ticket?
- No, never mind.
- You might say you're glad to see me.
- I'm glad to see you.
- Friends?
- Are you sure you're going to Brussels?
Friends.
Is okay, is okay.
It was just an accident.
Some accident!
You could get killed around here.
Yeah. I think somebody's trying to tell me something.
- You better get out of here.
- Come on, Jill.
I better get out of here.
- Which one's yours?
- That one.
- Sorry, miss.
- Sorry.
Have your passports ready, please.
Have your passports ready, please.
- What?
- What is this? Unhand me! How dare you?
Passengers, please claim your baggage before leaving the terminal.
Is shocking, the indignities a man must suffer.
Speaking of indignities, Arthur, you'd better finish dressing.
Well, I guess thas about...
Well...
- Well, watch out for falling trunks.
- Yeah.
Travel light.
- Jill, are you all right?
- Yes.
- Something's forever coming between us.
- Yeah.
You better move. Don't wanna miss your train to Brussels.
- And you don't miss your bus to...?
- To Bruges.
- Oh, yes, Bruges.
- Last call for the bus to Bruges. Last call.
The next bus leaves in 2 hours.
Can you see him?
Can I see him? You great, steaming nit.
Disappeared into thin air.
I thought I was rather good tonight.
- Tell the boys to wrap it up.
- Wrap it up, boys.
- You okay?
- I don't know.
I keep thinking about the trunk, the gate opening, now the baggage cart.
Coincidence. Just freaky accidents.
Then why do I feel like I'm being followed?
If mine eyes don't deceive me, I'd say that face over there was rather familiar.
Wrap it up.
- Hello again.
- Hi.
You must like to travel, to come so far for a one-night stand.
I hope you're referring to your itinerary.
- We play Antwerp tomorrow.
- Is that an invitation?
Well, look who's here.
Bag and baggage.
Excuse me.
- What are you doing here?
- Whas she doing here?
Wait a minute.
I thought you'd be glad to see me, but, oh, no, you're doing fine.
I was.
- Music lover.
- Les go.
- Where to?
- To my hotel.
Oh, super!
We can't talk here. I'm gonna straighten this out once and for all.
Superduper!
Come on.
Guy, darling, are you all right?
Why don't you watch where you're going, you crazy idiot!
You don't scare me! Not even that much!
Come on.
Running away from school?
You should know better.
You're old enough.
No, you're not. Thas just it.
You're too young.
Uncle Gerald shouldn't send you away like that by yourself at your age.
- Now, sit down!
- I am down.
Get off that bed! Get off the bed!
Put your shoes back on.
Put your shoes back on!
- My feet hurt.
- "My feet hurt."
Okay, so you had a beef with Uncle Gerald and you ran away.
There's nothing unusual about that.
As a kid, I was always in trouble with my folks.
Were you really?
Sure.
Running away doesn't solve anything.
Of course, when you're older, you'll understand that. Yeah.
You'll...
The smart thing to do is to call Uncle Gerald.
Put that down.
You're flitting around like a butterfly.
Why not light somewhere? Like here.
- I brought you up here to talk.
- And talk and talk.
Get off my bed. Don't you realize you're alone with a man in his hotel room?
- I love you.
- No, you don't.
- And you love me.
- No, I don't.
- Can't you hold still for a minute?
- For what?
For this.
- That drink you were holding...
- Yes, I know.
- You spilled it.
- Yes, I know.
Won't take me a minute to change.
Is in there.
Maybe she better not.
Like it?
Seventeen.
Seventeen will get me 20.
Oh, thas bad. Thas very bad. Very.
You don't know what you're doing.
Well, what I don't know, you can teach me.
Some schoolgirl.
She must major in hygiene.
- I need some air.
- Oh, we'll open a window.
Eighteen in three days?
In two days now.
Imagine that. Time flies.
- Nope. No, you don't.
- But, darling!
Don't "but, darling" me.
I'm sending you home tonight.
You said you loved me.
You say a lot of things when you're trying to... Well, you know.
Do you say it to all the girls you're trying to... You know?
- No.
- No?
You're going home tonight, and thas that.
All right. The worst he can do is beat me again.
Sure, the worst he can do is beat you.
Beat you? Uncle Gerald?
Oh, don't worry. He's very careful.
The bruises never show.
- The man's a fink!
- I don't mind the pain, really.
But I dread being locked in my room for days at a time. I get so hungry.
Don't just stand there.
Put your clothes on.
- You're sending me back!
- To that bluebeard? Fat chance.
Oh, I am glad.
- I'm taking you to that school.
- Oh, no!
- Oh, Guy, please take me with you.
- Take you with me?
There's been too many weird things happening to me lately.
- Just till Stockholm, please?
- Stockholm? Thas three days away!
Do you realize I'm in big trouble already?
I won't be in the way.
I'll do whatever you tell me. I promise.
And once we've reached Sweden, well, everything will be fine in Sweden.
- What would be so fine in Sweden?
- Well...
I have this dear, sweet, old maiden aunt in Stockholm to look after me.
- Old maiden aunt?
- Aunt Harriet. She looks just like me.
- Just till Stockholm. Not one step further.
- Oh, darling!
- No more of that "darling" stuff.
- No more of that "darling" stuff.
- You do exactly as I say.
- Yes, Guy.
Well, what is that? I can't take you anywhere looking like that.
No, Guy.
- Don't just stand there. Get changed.
- Yes, Guy.
- You can't get changed without this.
- No, Guy.
- Close the door.
- Yes, Guy.
I'll dump some of your things into my bag. We'll travel faster that way.
Is all kind of exciting, isn't it?
Me serving time for kidnapping is exciting?
But you didn't kidnap me.
I'm here of my own free will.
- Remember that when my trial comes up.
- I will.
Must be nuts. I could get shot for this.
Okay, okay, I get the message!
You don't have to hit me over the head!
Me and my big mouth!
- They're just saying good morning.
- All right, good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Gosh, is lovely. Beautiful!
Thank you.
Les go.
I'll be right back. Don't go away.
The boys haven't arrived yet.
First thing is to find a place to stay.
- Then we can see the festival.
- See it from the hotel window.
- Thas no fun.
- Neither was being shot at last night.
- Look, I got enough to worry about.
- Thas not fair.
- You wanna go back to your uncle?
- No, Guy.
- Then you mind me.
- Yes, Guy.
He's gone! Quick, pick it up, and we'll make a run for it.
I can't reach it!
You're closer to the ground than I am.
You try it.
Very well. Lower me down onto it, and I'll pick it up.
Right. Here we go.
- Casual. Casual.
- Right.
- Casual.
- Right.
Excuse me.
Get me up!
Isn't there a man somewhere wondering where you are?
There are many men, darling. I have an old beau right here in Antwerp.
- Thas where I'm staying, at his studio.
- Studio?
He's a sculptor.
You know, he takes globs of wet, clammy clay...
...pushes it here, pokes it there, and voilà! A nude lady.
Well, thas one way.
Would you like to see it? We could hop in my car and be there in no time.
Would your friend with the clammy clay object?
No. He's in Paris.
He won't be back for a week.
- Sounds cozy.
- Doesn't it?
Excuse me, Mr. Lambert.
May I have your autograph, please?
- Why not?
- Not with that.
- Would you like it in blood?
- Yes, please.
After I cut your throat.
About my cozy suggestion...
Any man in his right mind wouldn't refuse.
- Unless he were in love.
- In love? With that silly schoolgirl?
You better take another look, professor.
Is graduation day.
- Claire...
- Yeah, I know.
Some other time.
- I won't call you. You call me.
- Thanks. I'll do that.
No! Don't! No!
Oh, thas very funny!
I'm sorry.
Hello.
Is me.
- The girl from the boat train.
- Amazing. I didn't recognize you.
- What are you...?
- What are you...?
- Ladies first.
- Oh, I'm enjoying the festival.
And having a wonderful time, as usual?
- Mind if I join you?
- I really wasn't going anywhere.
- Then let me be your guide.
- All right.
Did you know that Antwerp is the seat of the oldest stock exchange?
- No.
- Yes, indeed.
Is also the world center of the diamond trade.
Thas an interesting thing to know.
Jill?
Jill!
Oh, is so peaceful here.
I love the sound of the crickets.
I discovered something interesting.
Let me show you.
All right.
Is in here.
This well is as old as Antwerp.
They must have built the city around it.
- Is this part of your thesis?
- My what...? Oh. Yes, it is.
I've written a couple of pages on Antwerp already.
Oh, you've dropped something.
Your uncle gave this to me.
I see. Then you're not a friend, my uncle hired you to follow me.
Thas not quite true, Jillian.
- I don't understand.
- Well, is really very simple.
Uncle Gerals been dipping into your inheritance.
Comes a day of reckoning:
Your 18th birthday.
You see now how it is, don't you, Jillian?
Is all been leading up to this moment.
From the time you left London...
...my associate and I have followed your every move.
This wood is rotten.
Even your light weight should break the fence and go through the boards.
I don't care about the money.
If you tell Uncle Gerald that, then maybe...
- There's an element of greed in all of us.
- Oh, no!
The taste of your money has increased your uncle's appetite.
- I'm sorry, Jillian.
- No!
- In a moment, it will all be over.
- No! Please!
No! Help!
Help!
You play pretty rough, mister.
Wanna try me?
With pleasure.
Guy!
Jill!
Come on!
- Oh, Guy, I'm scared.
- Just take it easy. Take it easy.
I've never seen a dead man before.
What are we going to do?
What we planned to do.
I'll take you to your aunt in Sweden.
- My who?
- Your aunt in Stockholm.
Oh, yes. Aunt Charlotte.
Aunt Harriet!
- About here, I'd say.
- In all that water?
- Ill put us two hours out of Amsterdam.
- There ain't an easier way?
- Easier?
- I mean, a little less dangerous.
There's nothing to it. We simply plant a tiny bomb in the boiler room.
A bomb in the...?
By the time it goes off, we'll be long gone away in a lifeboat.
Mutiny. Mutiny.
You dirty rat!
Quiet, you traitor.
Captain, it does sound quite simple.
Yes, it is, matey. A friend of mine scuttled his ship the very same way.
What happened to him?
He's got a grocery business in Putney, all with his share of the insurance.
- Groceries, eh?
- Captain! Passengers coming aboard.
- Passengers?
- Passengers?
- Captain Roach?
- Aye, and who might you be?
- Your passengers.
- Man the lifeboat. Bombs away!
- Ever thought of going by plane?
- Is much faster and a lot safer.
Nobody travels by sea anymore.
- I think is a lovely boat.
- A ship, lady. A canoe is a boat.
Why don't you both go by canoe?
The S.S. Damocles. Thas the name on the ticket and on your ship.
And thas good enough for us.
- It leaks, you know.
- Like a sieve.
All right. Give me your boarding passes.
- We don't have any boarding passes.
- You haven't picked them up yet?
No, we can't go through lmmigration to pick them up.
Whas a couple of boarding passes among friends, huh?
You think we're spies? We just want to sail on your dirty ship, not blow it up.
You're too late.
There's a bomb in the boiler room.
You leave me no alternative.
Off.
Off!
Bye!
- What do you suppose it says?
- Aren't the pictures enough?
Les get out of here.
- We'd like a room, please.
- My English is not good.
You will write, please? Name?
And passport, may I see, please?
It is not your passport.
- Is a game we play.
- Yeah. Is called "Button...
...button, who's got the...?"
- "Button."
If you're not a tailor, I'm in big trouble.
She's not right. She thinks you are her husband who ran away.
- Oh, great.
- She thinks every man her husband.
Room five.
I tell her he's your man.
- Is that another game you play?
- Oh, is...
- Yeah, yeah. Is called...
- "Be kind to children week."
- "A friend in need is a pest."
- Yes.
Which way, please?
- Over there.
- Thank you.
Charming room. Elegant design.
What would you call it?
Early poverty, to me.
- Oh, gosh, I'm done in.
- Yeah, I've had it.
- Whas so funny?
- I was just thinking.
Whas a nice little girl like you doing in a dump like this?
- You said no more of that.
- Thas right. It wouldn't be fair.
Not if you didn't love me.
You deserve a guy who tells you more than a bedtime story.
- You deserve the marrying kind.
- And you're not the marrying kind?
Thas what I've been trying to tell you.
It won't work. It just won't work.
Guy, where are you going?
To make a phone call. I think
I found a way to get us into Sweden.
Oh, please don't leave me here alone.
I'll be back just before you know it.
- There he goes, Archie.
- She's still in the hotel. Alone.
Right, and with the suitcase.
Don't muff it.
Casual, Arthur. Casual.
Casual.
And goedemiddag to you too.
I'm looking for a girl.
Girl.
- Again English. Well, I'll try.
- She's about so high.
Should be alone.
There was a man with her, but he's gone.
Yes. A shame.
She's not right.
Is that a fact?
Over there. Room seven.
- Hello?
- Hello, Claire? This is Guy.
Look, I'm in trouble. I need your help.
I think I'm running out of time.
What is it, Guy? Whas the matter?
Jill's at 89 Park Straat.
89 Park Straat, room five.
Room five. Yes, I've got it.
There's no time to explain.
Will you pick her up...
...and take her to the studio with you?
- Yes, of course.
Okay, thanks. I'll meet you there later.
- Are you Guy Lambert?
- Yes, I am.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
I'm Sergeant Havert, and these are my two assistants...
...hardly worth mentioning,
Sylvester and Harry.
And I'm Herbert. And I'm sorry we have the pleasant duty to arrest you.
Arrest me for what?
Well, I... I really...
I have to go, really. You don't understand.
I am Inspector de Groote.
Be seated, please.
- No, thanks. I really can't stay.
- Help Mr. Lambert to sit down, please.
- Well, if you really insist.
- To begin with, Mr. Lambert...
...would you tell us where we could find Jillian Conway?
Jillian Conway? I never heard of her.
Let me warn you, if your memory does not improve...
...this friendly visit could lengthen into a permanent stay.
You can't hold me, de Groote.
- Inspector de Groote.
- Not without charges.
As for the charges,
I have it on good authority...
...that kidnapping is still considered a criminal offense.
Kidnapping?
You find that amusing?
Well, not exactly.
You mean, you don't want to question me about...
Kidnapping. Imagine that.
Do you deny you took Miss Conway by force?
Of course I didn't.
Give the trio a five-minute break.
They're boring holes in my neck.
- You've been in touch with Jill's uncle?
- Mr. Waverly?
He's the one who reported her missing.
He also suggested you might help find her.
And did he tell you why Jill ran away?
But did she run away, or was she kidnapped, Mr. Lambert?
- Which leads back to me?
- Exactly.
So let us forget Mr. Waverly.
We can't forget him.
He's the reason for it.
This story is too crazy to be believed.
But this crazy story, would Miss Conway support it?
- Of course she would.
- Then, Mr. Lambert, where is she?
Room five. 89 Park Straat.
Mr. Lambert has decided to be cooperative.
89 Park Straat. Room five.
Thank you, inspector.
You've been very kind.
Don't let him get away.
He's gonna kill her.
- What on earth?
- Stop it!
What on earth?
Take your hands out of my pockets!
- This is the wrong man!
- Stop it!
Thas the wrong man, you idiots.
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Well, I never. Disgraceful.
- May I leave now?
- But of course.
Thas right, call your hatchet man.
Have him do the job you hired him for.
- You're irritating me.
- Murder is an irritating business.
Would you be good enough to send one of your own men for my niece?
Certainly, but you needn't feel you have to prove anything to me, sir.
I shall sit right here until Jillian arrives.
Right here, Lambert.
So you can plainly see
I shall make contact with no one.
We shall all sit and wait.
What...? They've got away!
If we lose them now, is all your fault, Arthur.
What were you doing in there, anyway?
Arthur!
Get in, and les get after them! Get in!
You great, long drink of water!
Get in, for goodness' sake!
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
- Baby mouse!
Baby mouse!
Come back to the mama mouse!
- Come back to the mama mouse!
- 89 Park Straat.
Excuse me, pussycat.
Mice! Three!
Inspector de Groote.
I know you're not Inspector de Groote.
I am Inspector de Groote. Idiots!
- He's angry.
- Let me talk to him.
Let me talk to him.
Inspector? Inspector?
Hello? Hello, hello?
- Inspector?
- Inspector?
- Idiots!
- Just a moment. Inspector de Groote?
I'll be with you in a bit.
Just a moment.
- Let me talk to him.
- Hello?
Where have you been? Idiots!
Without a trace?
I see.
Miss Conway has left the address you gave us, Mr. Lambert.
Left? Yes, well, I hope for your sake nothing happens to Jillian, Lambert.
How can it with you sitting right here?
How long will you keep me under surveillance?
- Until midnight.
- Midnight?
We can all help Jill celebrate her birthday.
This is absurd.
All right, Lambert. I accept the challenge.
Good.
Inspector, what do you do around here for amusement?
- I arrest people.
- You never lock the door and play cards?
I am inspector of police, sir.
I have a position to uphold.
A position of respect and honor.
And I am, sir, a man of integrity.
I'll thank you to remember that.
A little draw poker, maybe?
Fine!
- Mr. Waverly?
- No, thanks. I'll catch up with the news.
Mr. Lambert.
Business must be good.
Excuse me.
There it is, Arthur.
They've left it in the car.
How obliging.
I'll have that open in two seconds flat.
Casual, Arthur. Casual.
Where?
There's sheer panic going on inside of you, isn't there?
Time's running out, and you know it.
Please, Mr. Lambert, make your play.
You've been bluffing all evening.
- I am not.
- I wasn't talking...!
If I may, inspector,
I'd like to make a phone call.
I'm late now for an engagement.
I should phone my apologies.
- Not on your life.
- Lf you don't mind, it is my phone.
He's gonna call his hatchet man and tell him to...
To what, Mr. Lambert? To kill my niece?
Where shall I tell him to look?
You're the only one who knows.
- Mr. Waverly, please, make your call.
- Thank you, inspector.
- You shouldn't let him do it.
- Mr. Lambert, please make your play.
He'll make his play.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Well, if is not hello, is obviously goodbye.
Cheers.
No answer.
Thank you anyway, inspector.
I can hardly keep my eyes open.
The bedroom's right through there.
Why don't you lie down for a while?
I think I'd better.
Mr. Lambert, please.
Mr. Lambert, make your play, please.
Is beginning to get to you, isn't it?
Look at you!
Your nerves are starting to crawl.
Aren't they?
Aren't they?!
Well, why aren't they?!
Tell me that!
I hate a sore loser.
That phone call. That phone call!
Thas it, isn't it?
You knew where Jill was all along.
Uncle Gerald, you are a fink!
- What was that?
- I believe Mr. Lambert just escaped.
You fools, what are you doing?
After him!
Look! He stole my car.
This is a criminal offense.
Follow me! Are you coming, Uncle Gerald?
I wouldn't miss it.
Uncle Gerald!
Quick!
Go! Go!
Do not lose sight of this car. Faster.
Don't let him get away.
Left! Turn left!
No, no. To the right. To the right.
Hello? Idiots, where are you?
Hello? Hello? Idiots, where are you?
Why should we tell you?
- Who's this speaking, please?
- Attention! This is Inspector de Groote.
Lambert is traveling west on Plascoubert.
- Where are you?
- In police car number six.
- Where are you?
- Where am I?
In police car number one.
In police car number one, idiots.
- Over and out.
- Over and out.
We hear you loud and clearly.
We hear you loud and clearly.
- In your hat.
- In your hat.
In your hat? Idiot!
There he is.
Quick! Hello?
Lambert has just turned north on Whittendale. Converge!
- Faster.
- Slower.
- Faster. Faster.
- Slower. Slower.
Idiot! Now we've lost him. He's gone.
Hello. We have just lost sight of Lambert.
Can you pick him up? Can you see him?
Sylvester, can you see him?
No. I can't even see you.
- Harry, can you see him?
- Not yet.
I can't see him, either.
Jill?
Jill? Jill?
Are you all right?
I still feel a little groggy.
You'll be okay now.
He's out cold.
You have an amazing right, for a singer.
Your lefs not so bad, either.
Thas far enough, sweetheart.
I was afraid of that.
Look, there it is. My car.
Converge on my car.
Yeah.
Sit down.
Idiots!
Fools! What are you doing?
I am Inspector de Groote.
Uncle Gerald, are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.
- Follow me! Follow me!
Quick!
I am Inspector de Groote. I'll take charge.
No one will leave this room until I do.
- Hello, Uncle Gerald.
- Jillian!
Alive and kicking. The party ended just before the gas heater took effect.
Gas heater? You can't connect me with any of this, Lambert.
Would you care to make a wager?
- Inspector.
- That poor, sweet eye, madame!
How did that happen?
He hit me.
It was the only way to get her gun.
Well, you've apprehended the right party now.
Don't be so ridiculous, Gerald.
Jail is no place for a lady.
Do you know Mr. Waverly, madame?
- Intimately.
- Will you be quiet, Claire?
Don't you understand, love?
If I go, you go.
Claire was the one Gerald called from your office.
It was a signal he was safe with a good alibi, and for her to turn the gas on.
I'd have given you the money.
Every shilling.
Now she tells him.
Claire wanted so many things.
I needed the money for her.
Do you realize what you're saying?
Unfortunately.
Then it is my duty to place you both under arrest.
- Do it then, and get it over with.
- Arrest this man!
Madame?
Damaging evidence.
Well...
Well?
Thas that.
Thas that.
I guess I'll be leaving now.
Well, goodbye.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry I lied to you about so many things.
- I lied to you too.
- About what?
I said I didn't love you.
Guy.
- Are you still here?
- You love me! You mean it!
- Now, wait a minute, Jill.
- Say it.
I love you.
Watch the wine.
- Kiss me.
- Not yet.
What?
Okay. Happy birthday.
Grayson's the name. Scotland Yard.
- Where is it?
- What? Scotland Yard?
No. I know where that is.
Your black suitcase.
Is in the car.
Gone!
- So are the jewels.
- What jewels?
Diamonds smuggled into your suitcase on the boat train.
If you knew that, then why did you wait till now?
Because I wanted to catch them with the diamonds.
- Who?
- Babcock and Brown, thas who!
Nothing quite like an ocean voyage, is there?
Right.
Things have worked out rather well, don't you think so?
They did. They did, indeed.
What do you suppose happened to that little schoolgirl?
- Do you think he married her?
- See for yourself.
Shall we go below?
What a kiss!
Come on, Arthur! Come on!
Have you got the suitcase?
Have you got the case?
Don't worry, Archie. I've got it. I've got it.
You've got it, all right.
Well, you better go back and get the rest of it!
Heave ho!
Heave ho!
This is another fine mess you've gotten me into.
Heave ho!
Ahoy there. Do you know what this is?
Is the end, pal.
The ever-loving, living end.

What do you think?
You know how I'm gonna score this part? For an oboe.
- Play it against your horn.
- Well, how about it?
It'll lighten up the melody and give it a nice effect.
- Eddie, now, what do you think?
- It's good, man.
Just good, huh?
That's better than bad.
But you don't think it's good enough to show?
I didn't say that.
Well, you said the melody was heavy.
- I didn't say that either.
- Eddie, I heard what you said.
You said you had to score it for an oboe because the melody was too heavy.
Man, we been at this too long.
We both need some shuteye.
If you don't like it, why don't you say so?
I said I liked it.
Yeah, I heard the way you said it.
What do you want me to say? It's great?
All right, you're Gershwin, you're Ravel and Debussy.
- What's wrong with that?
- Look, you're Ram Bowen.
You write a piece of music, I listen to it, and that's what it says.
Ram Bowen, all by itself. Now, what more than that do you want?
Besides, what's my opinion, man? A court of law?
I don't want an oboe playing that melody. What do you think of that, man?
I think you're tired, you've been up all night.
I'm not gonna give that melody to an oboe...
So give it to a tuba.
- Because it's so heavy.
- Get off my back, Ram.
Look, I need sleep, man.
I give up my nights.
No sleep, no dames, no nothing.
I sit here, morning after morning, arranging your music?
What do you want, a medal?
I ought to walk. I ought to just walk.
- Why don't you just walk?
- All right.
Ram?
Will you be here for dinner?
- I don't know.
- I bought a chicken.
I said I don't know.
When you clear the decks, you really clear them, don't you?
- Eddie.
- What's bugging you, Ram?
I don't know.
I like the music, man. I like it fine.
Sounded very good.
Yeah, Eddie thought so, too.
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.
What are you gonna do? You gonna stew the chicken?
Well...
Why don't you cook it the other way?
So we can have it cold later, with some of that cold white wine?
You should get some sleep.
I'll sleep later.
You're really gonna stew that chicken?
- Yes. And it takes a long time.
- So do it later.
- I have other things to do.
- So do them later.
- Why?
- Do you need a reason?
You need a reason, not I.
Why do you need me today?
Because you feel you're wonderful, or because you feel you are worth nothing?
- Well, what do you care?
- I care.
Well, you get what you want.
You think that's all I want?
No, I think you want what I want.
- Don't be so sure.
- No?
No, no, no, Monsieur.
S'il vous plaît. Leave my baggage here.
- Leave it here.
- Excuse me.
- Do you speak English?
- Yeah. You need some help?
Oh, do I need some help. My girlfriend is off chasing another porter because he took her bags and left...
Yeah, well, they'll do that. You...
You want to wait for her here, is that it?
Yes, please.
Can you explain to him that I want to leave my...
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I think I can manage by myself.
Is your friend as pretty as you are?
Yes.
She's a white girl.
She might be hard to find. All these white girls look alike.
Connie. Connie. I got a taxi. Come on, give the man your bags, quick.
What took you so long?
Who's he?
I don't know.
Thank you.
- The black one?
- Yes, please.
He's nice.
Ram Bowen. How are you, man?
- How are you, Chic?
- Everything is peaches.
Say, Wild Man's still down there, isn't he?
Yes, he's back there holding court.
I'll be down to see you at your joint.
- Oh, you're Ram Bowen?
- Yes, ma'am.
I've heard you on records.
Were you on the boat?
- No, I live here in Paris.
- Oh, I see.
My friend and I were on the boat. That's why I asked.
We're here on our vacation.
We decided we'd come this time of year, because it's cheaper, you know?
Lillian, we'd better get started for the hotel.
All right.
You want to hear me play some night, just tell the cab driver
"Marie's Cave," okay?
Ram. Ram Bowen.
How are you?
Knew you'd come and meet the Wild Man.
- How are you there, Wild Man?
- Let me look at you.
You're looking great, boy, real great.
Younger than me. This town agrees with you.
What is it, the chicks or the wine?
Oh, it's both, man.
I hear you've taken the town right over.
They tell me I gotta blow real loud to put you down.
Oh, yeah, sure.
People's talking about your playing, Ram. Nice, real nice.
Be up there one night and blow you out of the joint.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Hey, I got a favour to ask you, Wild Man.
What's this?
You writing music?
It ain't relaxing to write it, man, only to play it.
Let's see what you got here.
I don't see why we can't go and hear him tonight.
- We haven't got any engagements.
- We came to see Paris.
Do you want to start by sitting in a night club as though we're still in the States?
I guess you're right.
Besides, Lillian, I know these jazz musicians.
If we go tonight, he's gonna think we're eager.
I suppose so. You know something?
- What?
- I am eager.
- Okay, you guys...
- What happened with Wild Man?
- He's giving it to René Bernard.
- René Bernard?
Where's the Gypsy?
Where is he?
The pusher does not want to wait until tomorrow when I get paid.
- Where? In the alley?
- Yes.
Ram.
- He uses two decks, right?
- Four.
Four?
- Okay.
- For you, it cost more.
Less for Gypsy. Friend.
You never had a friend.
- Ram.
- Later.
Oh, Eddie, has it started down there yet?
- Yeah. We had a few sets.
- Okay.
So, you think it's all right for two girls to go out to a nightclub alone?
Of course, this is Paris.
Anything is all right.
Besides. I want to see Ram Bowen.
You've come to the right place.
You in the band?
Come on, I'll take you down.
Thank you.
- You girls know the Ram?
- Not really.
Well, he tried to pick her up in the train station.
She knows him, all right.
I want a good table for the ladies.
I gotta go to work. I'll see you in a few minutes.
That sure is a cute little devil you tried to pick up in the station today, big daddy.
Tried? Looks like I have.
Come on, man, let's play.
Mood Indigo.
See you.
Well, how about something to eat?
- Could we go to Les Halles?
- Yeah.
- We can and we will.
- Let's walk there.
Say, are you gonna take off without saying goodbye?
I didn't even get a hello from you.
Lillian Corning.
- Ram Bowen.
- Hello.
How are you? What's your name, honey?
I thought you...
Connie Lampson.
You thought what?
I thought you knew.
No. You thought you were gonna run off with her, right?
Why don't we cut out, huh?
I thought we'd all go and have some breakfast.
Together.
Well, I think we'll have a little breakfast alone.
I think we'd better be getting back to the hotel, Lillian.
What, are you kidding? I mean, you went to all the trouble to find out where I was playing and then you stuck it out until closing time.
Wait a minute.
That wasn't her, that was me.
She didn't even wanna come and I insisted.
And then she wanted to go home.
So please, don't talk like that.
Why are you apologising for his rudeness?
Ram...
Yeah, I'd better get lost.
Oh, no, come on. Go with us, please?
Oh, what's the matter, kid?
Somebody forget it was your birthday or something?
What do you want me to do, apologise?
All right, I apologise.
I apologise.
No, I'm sorry.
I really am. Okay?
Okay?
Now, why don't you go on with your friends?
Because I'm not in a very good mood tonight.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
I just wanted to tell you how much your music meant to me.
Thank you very much.
I'm sure you hear that all the time.
No, actually, you never hear that enough.
You'd better go on with your friends.
I can't. They went already.
Kid, you don't want me for what you want.
Now, in the States, when you got nothing to do, maybe.
But in Paris, I'd just be a waste of a good vacation.
There are companies that take care of tourists.
You know, I'm not the Travellers Aid.
Well, I'm not looking for any help, so you don't have to worry about me.
I'll tell you the truth, honey.
I worry about me, not you.
Honestly, you're in no danger from me.
That phrase does not exist coming from a female, especially a female on a two-week vacation.
It's like a job I had when I was a kid in camp.
Boy, the dames just came up like sharks.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Hey, wait a minute.
Are you tired?
- But don't you need to sleep?
- No, I...
I like to walk. And I like the way you walk.
And Paris is a city to walk in.
- It's a beautiful city.
- Yeah.
It takes more than two weeks to see it, though.
Can't you stretch your time a little?
No, I have to go back to school.
- You go to school?
- I'll start teaching next term.
- What's that?
- Notre Dame.
You didn't even look.
Well, I didn't think they'd moved it.
I guess you've pointed it out to lots of girls from here.
One or two. Maybe three.
- Well, it's lovely.
- So are you.
And I've never said that to any of them before.
Well, not more than one of them.
Not more than one on this bridge.
You know, if I had a teacher like you when I went to school, boy, I would've learned something.
- I think you've learned enough.
- Not in school.
You said something about buying me some onion soup.
It won't run away.
No, but I might.
You might run from here?
The garden spot of the Western world? You might run?
Look at it.
Look.
And not just what you see, but the way the place makes you feel.
I'll never forget the first day I walked down Avenue Champs Élysées.
Just like that, I knew
I was here to stay.
How long have you been away from home?
- Five years.
- You've never wanted to go back?
No.
You stick around Paris for a while and stretch a bit.
Sit down for lunch somewhere without getting clubbed for it and you'll wake up one day, look across the ocean and you'll say,
"Who needs it?"
Who needs it?
Well, we certainly don't need to sit down for lunch and get clubbed for it.
Amen.
But we do need our roots, don't we?
And where our roots are, our home is. Wouldn't you say?
I would say that you're one of them socially conscious chicks, right?
Home, to me, is home. And my family is my family.
And whatever problems they've got, I've got them, too.
Of all the beautiful girls who come to Paris every year,
I get a swinger for the cause.
Well, I can't fight you on an empty stomach.
Besides, we've just met, so
I think I'd better take you and buy you that onion soup.
I think you'd better.
It really is like every painting of Paris I've ever seen.
It's beautiful.
- You like this all the time?
- Like what?
I don't know. In my league, the guy usually makes the pitch.
You not only pitch, you pick up the bat and hit for one.
You come on like this with all the guys?
No. Only with the special ones.
How many of those have you met?
One. Yesterday.
Yeah, but you were probably pretty ripe for him.
Two weeks in Paris on the loose. That's why you thought he was so special.
No. I don't know.
I watched all those people last night while he was playing.
They thought he was pretty special, too.
- Yep, plays a good horn.
- Yep, plays a good horn.
It's much more than that.
It's the way he feels when he plays it, and the way he made me feel.
That's why I may have been ripe, but not just for anybody.
Do you know anything about music?
I've got a friend who says he knows everything about music, except what he likes, and I'm the opposite.
What's Paris Blues?
Hey, you'd better get dressed.
Do you write music, too?
Honey, I live music. Morning, noon, the whole night.
Everything else is just icing on the cake. You dig?
- I dig.
- And I...
I got no time, no serious time, for anything else. I laugh it up.
- You don't have to explain.
- No, for your own good.
I mean, you don't want to take a chance on a guy who won't...
You know something?
Everybody is always waiting for everybody else to take a chance, because they're so afraid.
Me, I'm more afraid of not taking a chance than taking it and getting...
Well, you can get kicked in the teeth that way.
My brother's a dentist.
What do you do with yourself?
Back home, I mean.
Small town, small job, small life.
- What do you do, collect dolls?
- No.
Those are for the kids.
My kids. I have two children.
- This a picture of them?
- Yes.
That's crazy, man.
You know, the big one looks like you.
Thank you.
Now, aren't you interested in knowing whether or not I'm married?
None of my business.
Well, I'm not. I mean, I was, but I'm not now.
So you're not.
Well, don't look so disappointed.
What kind of guy was your husband?
He was a nice guy.
- Very sweet, and very kind.
- What happened?
What happens?
Kids and I get along fine.
We live in a big old house with lots of room.
The kids have friends and I have friends.
- Boyfriends?
- All kinds.
And you dig it, huh?
- I mean, that small town jazz.
- Yes.
Here's your picture.
Yep.
I'm acquainted with those houses.
- You know why it's so quiet?
- Why?
Because everybody's dead inside those houses.
The quiet of the grave.
When it's quiet in my house, it simply means the children are asleep.
Look, you like the life, you live it.
You know, you're not dressed yet.
Guess Eddie's still out with that friend of yours.
I think they liked each other.
Well, we gotta work this afternoon.
You'd better go back to the hotel.
All right.
Suppose your friend's not there when you get back.
- I'll take a walk.
- By yourself? You'll get lost.
I have a map.
Hey, wait a minute. Why don't you stay here, at least until I get in touch with Eddie?
You just do anything
I say, don't you?
- Well, I want to stay.
- You're a nut.
Well, I ain't getting involved with no nut.
You missed lunch.
I made the chicken the way you like it.
Couldn't make it,
I got snarled up.
We can have it cold tonight.
Some other night.
You're getting snarled up again tonight?
- Could be.
- I see.
You see what?
For you, lunch and dinner with the same woman, that's unusual.
How long is she here for?
I don't know. Couple of days. I don't dig this.
What're you trying to do, tie me up?
I'm trying to keep you untied.
I know what I need.
You need your work,
Ram. That's all.
And me, or someone like me.
Nothing else works for people like us.
We've got company, man. Remember?
Oh, yeah.
It's only been a couple of days.
Give it a chance. Come on.
You know, no matter how cold it gets, there's always somebody fishing.
Do they ever catch anything?
Yeah. Old shoes, tin cans, maybe a cold.
Oh, it's all so...
I don't know what.
- Picaresque? Charming, colourful.
- Yes. All right.
Oh, I hope we can eat on the boat.
You just had breakfast.
I can always eat. You wouldn't know it, but I eat like a horse.
I'd know it.
- It shows?
- Not in public.
Not in private, either.
It's all right. I like a girl with a little...
A little what?
I have never seen so many of them.
They're just everywhere.
Well, it's the City of Love, doll.
Just not brotherly love, that's all.
And they're out in the open, too.
The French are very practical people. They get their fresh air at the same time.
You'd think he'd be exhausted after working all night.
Not him. I've seen him go like this for a week.
Ten days, just balling it up. And then...
Somebody comes along, scoops him up and pours him out at his house.
It's such a crazy life.
Yeah, well, that's because you're one of the day people.
We are the night people, and it's a whole different world.
You don't think they can mix?
Well, I don't mind them going to public places together, but I certainly wouldn't want one of them to marry my sister.
Well, now, let me see.
Connie's a day person.
- You're telling me.
- And I'm a day person.
But you know something?
- I think you are.
- No.
- Well, you're not like him.
- Well, I'm taller than him.
No, you're steadier.
Don't you let him fool you.
He's as steady as a rock about the things that are important to him.
- Like music?
- Like music.
Oh, indeed.
Sure, Eddie could get a job with any band he likes.
Wild Man Moore would pay him a fortune.
But he stays with you.
He likes Paris.
He likes you, too.
I like him. But I guess that doesn't surprise you.
- No, ma'am.
- Well, it surprised me.
I never thought I could be interested in anybody like Eddie.
The way he lives and the way I am.
That's his way.
I know. But to me, that's like turning your back on what you really are.
I couldn't live like that.
Look, you like him, play it cool.
You dig each other?
Let it go at that.
Oh, Ram, you make it sound like it's some kind of a game.
But what do you do if it's not a game?
Don't ask me, honey.
I only play games.
Come on, let's cut out.
- Home?
- Yeah, home.
They want to be alone, too. Come on.
So, you don't mind being called "Mr. Black Man."
Of course not. Why should I?
That's what I am, a black man.
You don't mind because that's a French kid.
- If that were an American...
- Baby.
Do you want to have fun, or do you want to discuss the race question?
I can't separate them. Not with you. It's too important to me.
- It's...
- You.
Look. Here, nobody says,
"Eddie Cook, Negro musician."
They say, "Eddie Cook, musician," period. And that's all I want to be.
And that's what you are here.
That's what I am here.
Musician, period.
And I don't have to prove anything else.
- Like what?
- Like...
Because I'm Negro I'm different, because I'm Negro
I'm not different.
I'm different, I'm not different... Who cares?
Look, I don't have to prove either case. Can you understand that?
There isn't a place on the face of the
Earth that isn't hell for somebody.
Some race, some colour, some sex.
For me, Paris is just fine.
Eddie, you're wrong. You're wrong.
And I'm not denying what you feel, because it wouldn't be there if there wasn't a very good reason.
But things are much better than they were five years ago, and they're gonna still be better next year.
And not because Negroes come to Paris.
But because Negroes stay home, and with millions of white people, they work to make things better for everybody everywhere in America.
Look, are we gonna stand here all day discussing this jazz?
I have some shopping
I'd better do.

You gotta get a different system, or a different thing, Gypsy.
I'll talk to Nicole. Maybe you can see a doctor or something.
Gypsy?
This time, I mean it.
Who are you kidding, Rammy?
The doctor'll commit me.
Well, that won't kill you as fast as this will.
Why you care so much?
Why do you worry whether I live or die?
Because I worry.
You need my guitar, maybe, to play your music.
Yeah, maybe.
Never have you heard a guitar like mine.
- You were the best, Michel.
- I am the best.
No, were the best.
When I heard you play the first time, you had something.
But now, you're just burning up in the coke.
So, I'll be the best in the cemetery.
- Now, if you keep on this way...
- It's my way.
I'm lucky. If I die, I'll be buried by friends.
It is so long since I come here.
Is it a bird you wish me to meet?
I wouldn't think you like birds, Ram.
Many people fear birds.
They think of them as a snake that fly.
But I...
I have always loved the birds.
Their songs, their flying.
When I was a little boy,
I was sure I could fly.
Do you know that many children have this?
Like, a memory of flying.
Many children get killed trying to fly.
Did you know that? I tried once. From a high hill.
Very painful.
Now, I don't try to fly anymore, except in the music.
Birds are the only free things, and we put them in cages.
They look so sad, so starved. People are like birds, you know, Ram?
Nicole is a wren. Marie is a big, bold, shining starling.
And I'm the cuckoo bird?
At the Café Cité Bel Abbas, in the Arab quarter.
A new shipment.
Ask for me. Fausto.
Ram, you...
I knew him. Fausto the Moor.
The greatest of the flamenco guitarists.
He used to play like...
Like the night itself, in Granada.
What is he now, a pusher?
Sure. So he can get what he needs.
He's one year older than me. One year.
Look at him.
- I can't.
- Go ahead, look at him.
- That's you in a year, Gypsy.
- Ram.
- One year.
- Ram.
Come on.
You're gonna see a doctor, you hear me?
I know one who'll keep his mouth shut. But today, Gypsy, today.
Okay, Ram, I try. Whatever you say, I'll try.
Go ahead.
No, go ahead, you've been wanting to.
D Natural, honey.
You think that melody's heavy?
Oh, never mind.
- What time is it, anyway?
- About 11:15.
What? In the morning?
Oh, now wait, come on, come on, come on, come on.
- Lady, this romance is doomed.
- Why?
- You get up too early.
- This is late for me.
I'm usually up with the kids.
- What is that? Coffee?
- That's what it is.
Croissants?
It's bad enough you get up, you go out.
And I got the newspaper. Here.
You mean, there are other people up, too?
Whole city.
Well, what do you know?
Ram?
Can I hear the music all the way through sometime?
Sure, I told you, soon as it's finished.
Will it be finished by Friday?
We'll probably cut a record. Soon as it's performed, I'll send you one.
Will it be performed here in Paris?
Yeah, I guess so.
- Then back home?
- Maybe.
I'm very impressed.
Here, I'll play you a little bit.
It's not really orchestrated yet.
Just Eddie and me and a couple of the guys.
It's beautiful.
Even if you hadn't told me,
I'd know you wrote it, just from listening to you play, and from...
From what?
From the way you are with me.
Ram...
Come on, now, slow down. Just slow down.
- I can't. There's not much time.
- There's time enough.
Friday is so close.
We got time for a cup of coffee?
It's just that all these mornings
I've watched you sleeping and I've cleaned the apartment and I've made coffee, and I haven't done that for a man in a long time.
What do you want to do, wrap me up and take me home?
How are you gonna declare me at customs? A souvenir of Paris?
Ram, we could have so much.
Look, I'd do for you, and I'd keep people away while you were working and you could work well.
I'm sorry.
Works so well, huh?
You know how many dates I've broke to work with Eddie since you've been here?
I've been with you more than...
We had a good thing going. What do you have to spoil it for?
Because I couldn't go without telling you how I felt.
You know what you're telling me, don't you?
You're telling me to choose.
Yes, to choose. One or the other. You or that.
You know how long it took me to start that?
I mean, just start it?
And that's something that I wanted to do all my life.
I'm doing it. I got my life all arranged.
Like I told you, I got no time for what you want.
I want you. And I think you want me.
Well, we gotta do exactly what we should have done before this thing got started. Call it off.
You mean, not see each other?
Call the game on account of complications.
Anyway, you know, you want to see some more of Paris before you go.
You can't go home, people ask you... You haven't even seen the Eiffel Tower.
Well, you want me to get you a cab?
No. I'd rather walk.
- I don't know what to say.
- Well, then, don't say anything.
You know me, I've always got something to say.
Well, you know, you just picked the wrong guy for what you want.
- Did I?
- Yeah. I'm not on the market.
I wasn't shopping.
- You ready, man?
- Yeah, I'm ready, man.
Two, three, four.
Me, baby?
Burn.
Yeah.
Yes.
I will.
Certainly.
Ram. That call was from René Bernard.
He wants to see you tomorrow at 3:00 in his office.
Do you hear that, Ram, my love? You hear that?
Well. Come on, man. Wake up.
This is it. Happy time.
Hey, tomorrow night we close the club?
Yes. Tomorrow night we close the club.
Then I'll make a big party for my friend.
Music, eat, wine, big party.
Congratulations.
Congratulations, Ram.
Thank you.
- I can't carry these any further.
- Okay.
We'll leave them here with a note, saying, "Any genuine lover can take one."
I'll keep this one.
I always knew life was good, but
I didn't know it was this good.
You wanna hear something? I love you.
- I love you, too.
- Then I've got everything, huh?
And I didn't always know I didn't have everything.
- Now I know what I didn't have.
- Oh, me, too, Eddie.
It's wild, isn't it?
I felt this would happen to me. I didn't know when, and it's nothing like I thought it would be. It's impossible to imagine.
Yes, because it's good.
Everything is good.
Eddie?
Did anything like this ever happen to you before?
No. And I love this city.
But I'll never be able to walk here alone again.
Well, I don't want to ever walk here alone again.
- You're beautiful.
- Yeah?
Yes. And you make me feel beautiful.
I don't feel average when I'm with you. I feel very, very special.
I'd better warn you.
I want lots of children.
Not just two or three. I want lots and lots of children.
Okay.
Six children. Three boys and three girls.
And I want them all to look like you.
All right. Then we'll go out and get married.
Hey. There's a friend of mine I went to school with.
He's just been ordained a minister, in the good old USA.
Bully for him.
Connie, that was pretty sneaky.
Now, you marry a man, and you stay where he works and lives. Right?
You marry a man and you make a good home for him and for your children.
Eddie, please try it. Just come home and give us one year.
If it doesn't work like I say, we can come back here,
I promise that.
Connie...
Oh, Eddie, this is not your home.
This is a place you've run to. And
I don't want us running away.
I want us to go home and have a family, face what we have to face and change whatever we have to change.
I don't want any favours. Yes?
I don't beg for anything anymore, see?
Besides, you're interested in a cause.
I'm not interested in a cause.
I'm only interested in us.
You're not interested in us.
You're interested in you.
Come on, I'll take you back to the hotel.
No.
No, Eddie.
Connie? Hi.
I got that perfume you wanted.
Also, I got some more of those posters for the...
Yes. Yes, that's right. I would like to leave as soon as possible.
- Tomorrow would be fine.
- Tomorrow?
Yes. Can you confirm that for me?
Thank you. Yes, thank you very much.
Eddie?
It's not gonna work, Lillian.
I'd better get out while
I'm still in one piece.
This is ridiculous, Connie.
What did we come to Paris for?
To be run out of town by two kooks just because we got our feelings hurt?
Now, we're acting like two adolescents.
We've still got things to see.
I wouldn't know what I was seeing.
That doesn't make any difference. We've got two days, and we're going to use them.
I've got the list right here.
Now, we haven't seen the half of the Louvre.
We never did get to the top of the Eiffel Tower, we didn't get to the Catacombs, we haven't finished shopping.
And how can I get my return reservation?
The concierge will fix it.
You're not the only one who wants to get out in one piece.
Concierge, please.
You know, I used to look at you and Eddie and think, "My God, how simple it is for them."
Lillian, remember all the places we could've gone?
We should've gone there.
Mr. Bowen, so good of you to come.
How do you do, sir?
Pleased to meet you.
Please, have a chair.
- I have long been an admirer.
- Thank you very much.
But I know you didn't come here just to exchange pleasantries.
No, sir, I didn't.
Mr. Bowen, I have read this many times.
You have a genuine gift for melody.
Well, what does that mean, Mr. Bernard?
Simply what I said. You have a good melodic feel.
Mr. Bernard, I want to develop that theme into a piece to be played in concert.
Now, what's the possibility?
Mr. Bowen, you are a creative musician.
Every time you put a horn to your mouth, you're composing.
Your improvisations are highly personal.
They give you a stamp as a musician.
But there is a great deal of difference between that and an important piece of serious music.
In other words, you're trying to tell me I'm just sort of a lightweight.
I don't know what you are yet,
Mr. Bowen, and neither do you.
I'm only saying that you haven't yet given yourself a chance to find out.
Mr. Bernard, I've worked with musicians all my life.
I know everything I can do.
Perhaps you need to do something else now.
Paris is a great city for an artist to work and study.
Composition, harmony, theory, counterpoint.
Perhaps you need to change your life for a couple of years in order to give yourself a chance to do what you wish.
Well, in other words, it's no good.
On the contrary, I like it.
But it's not good enough to be played?
Oh, I'm certain a record company...
But nothing more than that?
It is what it is.
A jazz piece of a certain charm and melody.
Yeah, well, Jingle
Bells is a great tune.
You can hum that the first time you hear it.
Well, thanks for listening.
I appreciate it very much.
Mr. Bowen, what are you asking me?
- To say you are what you are not?
- No. You just told me what I am.
You have a talent.
You wish to be a serious composer, perhaps you will be.
- And perhaps I won't.
- Perhaps you won't.
Thank you, really, very much, sir.
Yes, what is it?
Yes, what is it?
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow.
You still want me to go with you?
What happened?
Well, what difference does it make?
I mean, if you want me to go with you, I'm going.
- If you don't want me...
- I want.
I'm no martyr. I want you.
- Connie, I must talk to you.
- Fine.
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hi.
Eddie.
Eddie, I'm going home tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow morning.
- But you've got three more days.
- Well, I've changed my plans.
Without telling me?
Eddie, I didn't dare tell you. I didn't dare.
Connie, I want you to stay here. See,
I want you to stay here with me.
Please don't ask me to do that.
I can't let you go.
Then come with me.
Connie, you know, every time... I could belt you for reminding me of all the things
I've tried five years to forget.
I go home with you and it'll be hard, it'll be so hard.
You know, I'm a different man. You see, I don't push easy anymore.
But I love you. I love you.
And if you'll be there,
I'll try. I'll try.
I'll be there.
Great. Great, great, great, great.
Ram, you... Why, you're my Ram.
How'd it go, Ram?
You know, this little chick and me, we're gonna make it together big.
We're taking off tomorrow for New York.
New York? I'm talking about
Bernard and the music.
Oh, yeah. You remember where you thought that melody was heavy?
Well, you were wrong. I mean, it was slight.
That's what the man said. "Slight."
He's a longhair and he doesn't always know what he's talking about.
- He knows.
- You give up writing music?
I'm gonna go back and just blow my horn.
Then I'll bring the whole bunch over across the pond, what do you say?
Very good. Sure. We all go.
Yeah, yeah, you, me, Eddie, the whole bunch, huh?
Sure.
Boy, we'd really make it big over there, Eddie.
You know they'd go crazy for Michel.
Yep.
Hey, what's with the party? Where's the action?
Hey, Lilly, you know that crazy gypsy makes a crazy stew.
Moustache, would you take her out, get her a plate?
- Yeah.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
Keep the party swinging right to the station.
- So you're happy?
- Well, yeah.
- Why? Were you worried for me?
- Not this time. Not anymore.
You mean, nothing anymore?
Something. Not important.
Was it ever?
Perhaps. But it leaves no mark. Like snow.
You sound sort of blue.
All colours. Like it should be.
- You leave tomorrow?
- Yeah.
It was good, Ram.
Yeah, it was good.
Come on, you cats. Let's swing a little bit. Come on. Come on.
Moustachio, hey,
Moustachio, inside, huh?
Eddie, would you grab your saxophone, huh?
Come on, come on, bring your plate, bring your plate.
Now find yourself a seat and prepare to get set.
Go on, go on, go on.
Hey, Gypsy.
Loosen up, will you, fellas?
Michel, come on.
Just a little one, baby.
A little one makes no difference.
Good for the body.
- Don't take it, Michel.
- Why?
I'm taking a little fix. What's so bad?
Come on, give it to me.
Look, baby, it's over now.
For you, for me.
It's over.
Hey, Ram.
Let's both fly for a little while.
Get out of here.
Get out of here, Ram.
You're leaving, Ram.
Why don't you leave?
Take your girl and go.
Get out.
Get out. Take your girl and go.
Just go, Ram.
You and your girl, both of you, get out.
Get out. Get out. Get out.
- How's Michel?
- He's all right.
Ram, I came to tell you that I'm leaving, too.
- What? Connie?
- Yes.
It figures. She's a nice kid.
- You coming with us tomorrow?
- I can't.
I've got too many things to settle here first, but I'll be along in a couple of weeks.
Well, I'm not waiting.
What I can't get into a suitcase the Salvation Army's welcome to.
It sure won't be easy watching you all go tomorrow on that sad old train.
Yeah.
Connie, why don't you go ahead?
Go on through.
- You come with us.
- Oh, I'll be there in a minute...
No, it's only a few minutes. I'd better wait.
He might've forgotten the platform or something.
But you go ahead. Go on.
Oh, Ram, I thought you weren't coming.
You're not going with me?
Will you come over later?
I'm staying here, Lillian.
I just came to say goodbye.
- Ram...
- I can't.
Lillian, I gotta follow through with the music.
I gotta find out how far I can go.
And I guess that means alone.
Well, vacation certainly goes awfully fast, doesn't it, when you're having a good time?
I wanna do something now.
I'd like to give you a going-away present.
You may not like it, but I don't care.
It's just this.
You're never gonna forget me.
You're gonna walk down the street of wherever you happen to be, you're gonna see me, even when you know I'm not there.
Nobody in this whole world is ever gonna be as right for you as I was for 12 days in Paris, in the autumn.
Because that's been your gift to me.
Guenevere, Guenevere.
In that dim, mournful year.
Saw the men she held so dear.
Go to war for Guenevere.
The rules of battle are not for
Lancelot du Lac, Your Majesty.
Let us attack now while they sleep.
We will attack when
I give the command, at dawn.
Merlyn... why is Jenny in that castle... behind walls I cannot enter?
How did I blunder into this... agonizing absurdity?
When did I stumble?
Where did I go wrong?
Should I not have loved her?
Then I should not have been... born.
Oh, Merlyn... how did it happen?
I haven't got much time.
A thin inch of sunlight... the arrows begin to fly.
Merlyn... if I am to die... in battle... please do not let me die... bewildered.
Think, Arthur.
Think back.
Think back.
Think back!
Oh, Merlyn!
Think back.
Think back!
Think... back.
Back! To one of the most important days of your life.
Oh, yes!
Hello.
My name is Arthur.
I think I'll call you...
Wart.
""I think I'll call you Wart.""
No, no, no!
Now you've gone too far back.
Not the day you met me!
The day you met Guenevere.
The day she came... to Camelot.
That's the beginning.
Yes.
I know... what my people... are thinking tonight.
I know what my people are thinking tonight.
As home through the shadows they wander.
Everyone smiling in secret delight.
As they stare at the castle and ponder.
Whenever the wind blows this way.
You can almost hear everyone say...
I wonder what the king is doing tonight.
What merriment is the king pursuing tonight?
The candles at the court
They never burned as bright
I wonder what the King is up to tonight.
How goes the final hour
As he sees the bridal bower.
Being legally and regally prepared?
Well, I'll tell you what the king is doing tonight.
He's scared Oh, he's scared.
You mean that a king who fought a dragon
Whacked him in two and fixed his wagon.
Goes to wed in terror and distress?
Oh, yes!
A warrior who's so calm in battle
Even his armor doesn't rattle.
Faces a woman petrified with fright?
Right!
You mean the appalling clamoring
That sounds like a blacksmith hammering.
Is merely the banging of his royal knees?
Please!
You wonder what the King is wishing tonight?
He's wishing he were in Scotland fishing tonight.
What occupies his time
While waiting for his bride?
He's searching high and low
For some place to hide.
And, oh, the expectation,
The sublime anticipation.
He must feel about the wedding night to come.
Well, I'll tell you what the King is feeling tonight.
He's numb! He shakes!
He quails! He quakes!
And that's what the King is doing.
Tonight!
How long before we get to Camelot?
Soon, Ma'am, but don't look out there, it's a ghastly forest.
It's the most ferocious, savage... terrifying forest I've ever seen.
I simply adore it.
Does Your Ladyship not realize that this forest is crawling... with outlaws and brigands?
Clary! You think there's a chance of meeting one?
Don't say it, Ma'am.
It would be marvelous.
Imagine, Ma'am, soon you will not only meet the man you will marry... but His Majesty,
King Arthur of England.
And one is the other.
What have you to say to that?
Was there ever a more inconvenient marriage of convenience?
I am at the golden age of seductability, and is my fate sealed with a kiss?
Is it? No, sealed with a seal!
Where are all the simple joys of maidenhood?
Where are all those adoring, daring boys?
Where's the knight pining so for me?
He leaps to death in woe for me.
Oh where are a maiden's simple joys?
Shan't I have the normal life a maiden should?
Shall I never be rescued in the wood?
Shall two knights never tilt for me.
And let their blood be spilt for me?
Oh, where are the simple joys.
Of maidenhood?
Shall I never be disputed for.
Or on any minstrel's lips?
Never have my face recruited for.
Launching countless ships?
Where are the simple joys of maidenhood?
Are those sweet, gentle pleasures gone for good?
Shall a feud not begin for me?
Shall kith not kill their kin for me?
Oh where are the trivial joys?
Harmless, convivial joys?
Where are the simple joys.
Of maidenhood?
Halt!
Her Highness will rest here while the Royal Hairdresser... attends her.
Can someone help with this canopy?
I should like some tea while I'm being coifed.
St. Genevieve.
It's Guenevere.
Remember me?
St. Genevieve
I'm over here, beneath this tree!
You know how faithful and devout I am.
You must admit I've always been a lamb.
But Genevieve, St. Genevieve.
I won't obey you any more
You've gone a bit too far
I won't be bid and bargained for
Like beads at a bazaar.
St. Genevieve, I've run away
Eluded them and fled.
And from now on I intend
To pray to someone else instead.
Oh, Genevieve, St. Genevieve.
Where were you when my youth was sold?
Dear Genevieve.
Sweet Genevieve.
Shan't I be young before I'm old?
A thousand pardons, my lady.
Don't run, I won't harm you.
You lie! You'll leap on me and throw me down!
I'll do no such thing.
You'll carry me off on your shoulder!
No, I swear by the sword Excalibur
I won't touch you.
Why not?
How dare you insult me in this fashion?
Do my looks repel you?
- No, you're beautiful!
- Did you hear me praying?
I couldn't help it.
You did pray loudly.
So you know who I am?
Yes, you're Guenevere.
So that accounts for your polite, respectful, despicable behavior?
Why isn't Merlyn here?
- Who?
- Merlyn. He's my teacher.
He's the wisest man alive. He'd know what to do. He lives backwards.
- Beg your pardon?
- He lives backwards.
He doesn't age. He... youthens?
He can remember the future... so he can tell you what you'll do in it.
Come here.
Close your eyes.
Please.
Now just turn, gently.
Very slowly, open them.
Do you see that castle?
It used to light up in a sort of pink glow.
When I was young, everything looked a little pink to me.
When Merlyn left, he took all the pink with him.
Don't stare. It's rude.
Who are you?
Actually, they call me Wart, actually.
- You sure you heard them properly?
- It's a nickname. Merlyn gave it to me.
Is it really Wart?
Why don't you run away with me?
You could be my protector, defend me all over the world... in France, in England,
Mongolia, Scotland.
What a wonderful dream you spin.
And how easy it would be for me to be caught up in it.
But...
I must decline.
You forcing me to stay?
Oh, no, My Lady!
If you persist in escaping, I'll find somebody brave to accompany you.
Then do so at once before your wretched king finds me.
Do look around you, My Lady!
Reconsider.
Camelot is unique.
And we have, by far and away, the most equable climate in all England.
Ordained by decree.
Oh, come now!
It's true.
It's true!
The Crown has made it clear.
The climate must be perfect.
All the year.
A law was made a distant moon ago here
July and August cannot be too hot.
And there's a legal limit to the snow here.
In Camelot.
The winter is forbidden till December.
And exits March the second on the dot.
By order, summer lingers through September.
In Camelot
Camelot.
I know it sounds a bit bizarre.
But in Camelot.
That's how conditions are.
The rain may never fall till after sundown.
By eight the morning fog must disappear.
In short, there's simply not
A more congenial spot.
For happily-ever-aftering.
Than here in Camelot.
And I suppose the autumn leaves fall into neat little piles?
No, My Lady.
They blow away completely.
At night, of course.
I know it gives a person pause.
But in Camelot.
Those are the legal laws.
The snow may never slush upon the hillside.
By nine p.m. the moonlight must appear.
In short, there's simply not.
A more congenial spot.
For happily-ever-aftering.
Than here... in Camelot.
Look! There, on the hill!
I'm truly sorry, but...
I'm afraid, on account of me... you may be hanged!
Or burnt at the stake for abducting me!
That uncivilized king of yours will...
Defend yourself!
There she is!
But who's that peasant with her?
The king!
Wart, it's the king!
Your Majesty, forgive me.
I did not know it was you.
The king.
When I was a young lad of 18 years of age... our good king, Pendragon, died, leaving no one to succeed him... but a sword stuck through an anvil that stood on a stone.
Written on it, in gold letters, it said...
"" Who so pulleth this sword from this stone... is rightwise born
King of all England. ""
Many chaps tried to dislodge it, but they failed.
So finally, a great tournament was proclaimed for New Year's Day.
All the mightiest knights in England were assembled at one time to have... a go at the sword.
I went to London as squire to my cousin, Sir Kay.
On tournament day, Sir Kay found he had left his sword at home... and he gave me a shilling to fetch it.
Going through London,
I passed a square and saw a sword... rising out of a stone.
Not thinking very clearly...
I thought it was a war memorial.
So I decided to borrow it... and to save myself the trip.
So I... took the sword and... and I failed.
So I tried again.
And I failed again.
So, with all my might,
I closed my eyes... and I tried... one last time.
And, lo!
The sword moved in my hand.
And slowly... it slid out of the stone.
I heard... a great roar.
I opened my eyes.
The square was full of people saying:
""...Long live the king!
Long live... the king. ""
That's how I became king.
I never knew I would be.
I never wanted to be.
And since I am,
I've been ill at ease in my crown.
Until I dropped from the tree... and my eyes... beheld you.
And then, for the first time...
I felt like a king.
I was glad to be king.
And most astonishing of all,
I wanted to be the most heroic... the wisest, the most... splendid king ever to sit... on any throne.
If My Lady will follow me...
I'll find a proper companion... to accompany you.
I hear it never rains.
Till after sundown.
By eight the morning fog must disappear.
In short, there's simply not.
A more congenial spot.
For happily-ever-aftering than here...
In Camelot.
The map of England.
Map, indeed.
A fishnet of ill-begotten kingdoms ruled by immoral lords... battling with their own unlawful armies over illegal border lines.
And who is... king of this... jungle?
The man who 4 years ago pledged he would become... the greatest king who ever sat on any throne.
I...
Arthur of England.
Yes.
The greatest warrior in the land.
For what purpose?
Might... doesn't always mean right.
What are you saying? To be right and lose couldn't possibly be right.
Merlyn... used to frown on battles.
Yet he always... helped me win them.
Why?
Proposition:
Is it far better to be alive than dead?
Yes, far better.
If that is so... then why do we have wars... in which people can get killed?
I don't know, do you?
Yes.
Because somebody attacks.
Why do they attack?
Did I ever tell you... how Merlyn taught me how to think?
No.
By changing me into animals.
Oh, really! Arthur!
Jenny, I mean by making me believe... he had changed me into animals.
For instance, when a hawk is up there looking down at the world... there are no boundaries.
Right?
Yet boundaries are what somebody always attacks about.
And you win by pushing them back across something that... that doesn't exist.
So we have battles for no reason at all.
Why, Jenny, why?
Because ladies love knights.
To see your knight in armor...
That's it, Jenny.
Jenny, that is it!
It's the armor!
It's the armor, Jenny.
The armor.
Only the knights are rich enough to have armor. The foot soldiers...
Well, they have nothing.
So, all that can happen to a knight is... an occasional... dent.
Proposition:
Right or wrong... if they have the might.
So right or wrong, they're always right.
That's wrong. Right?
I'm here.
Suppose we create a new order of chivalry?
A new order where might is only used for right.
To improve instead of to destroy.
We'll invite all knights... and kings of all kingdoms to lay down their arms to come and join us.
Oh, yes, Jenny.
And we'll... take one of the large rooms in the castle... put a table in it and all the knights will gather at it.
And do what?
Talk across it.
Debate.
Make laws. Plan improvements.
But, Arthur, do you think all the knights will ever want to... to do such a ridiculously peaceful thing?
We'll make it a great honor.
Very fashionable.
Everyone will want to join.
Only now... the knights will whack only for good.
Might for right.
Might for right.
Might... for right!
That's it, Jenny!
Might...
No, not might is right!
Might... for... right!
It's very original.
And civilized, Jenny.
It will have to be an awfully large table.
What of jealousy? All will claim superiority and want to sit at the head.
We'll make it... a round table.
So there is no head.
A round table!
My father's got one that would be perfect. It seats 150.
He had it as a wedding present and he never used it.
We'll send the heralds
Riding through the country.
Tell every living person far and near.
That there is simply not.
In all the world a spot.
Where rules a more resplendent king.
Than here.
In Camelot
Camelot.
In far off France
I hear you call.
To you alone I'll give my all.
I know in my soul what you expect of me.
And all that and more I shall be.
A knight of the table round
Should be invincible.
Succeed where a less fantastic man
Would fail.
Climb a wall no one else can climb
Cleave a dragon in record time.
Swim a moat
In a coat of heavy iron mail.
No matter the pain
He ought to be unwinceable.
Impossible deeds
Should be his daily fare.
But where in the world.
Is there in the world.
A man so extraordinaire?
C'est moi, c'est moi
I'm forced to admit.
'Tis I I humbly reply.
That mortal who these marvels can do.
C'est moi, c'est moi 'Tis I
I've never lost
In battle or game
I'm simply the best by far.
When swords are crossed
'Tis always the same.
One blow and au revoir.
C'est moi, c'est moi
So admirably fit.
A French Prometheus Unbound.
And here am I With valor untold.
Exceptionally brave.
Amazingly bold.
To serve at the table round.
The soul of a knight
Should be a thing remarkable.
His heart and his mind
As pure as morning dew.
With a will and a self-restraint
That's the envy of every saint.
He could easily work a miracle or two.
To love and desire
He ought to be unsparkable.
The ways of the flesh
Should offer no allure.
But where in the world
Is there in the world.
A man so untouched.
And pure?
C'est moi I blush to disclose
I'm far too noble to lie.
That man in whom
These qualities bloom.
C'est moi, C'est moi 'Tis I
I've never strayed
From all I believe
I'm blessed with an iron will.
Had I been made
The partner of Eve.
We'd be in Eden still.
C'est moi, c'est moi
The angels have chosen.
To fight their battles below.
And here am I
As pure as a prayer.
Incredibly clean.
With virtue to spare.
The godliest man I know
C'est moi!
Oh, King Arthur!
What caliber of man you must be... to have envisioned a new order of life.
I worship you before knowing you.
Don't run away, coward!
Come back and fight!
The swine!
- Are you hurt, Your Majesty?
- Fine.
Please!
The next time you traffic with me... remember, you challenge the right arm of King Arthur.
Really?
I am King Arthur.
What?
You... are the king!
Yes, almost the late king.
And I struck you?
Your Majesty!
I'm Lancelot du Lac.
In France I heard of your new order and came to join.
I beg Your Majesty to forgive me.
Not because I deserve it... but because by forgiving me...
I'll suffer more.
But, really, dear chap...
I don't want you to suffer at all.
I want to congratulate you.
Please rise. You, too, squire.
I can't, mon roi.
- I'm too ashamed to lift my head.
- Well, then I command you.
I have never felt a bash in my chest quite like it.
It was most spectacular.
Where did you learn to do it?
My skill comes from training, mon Roi.
My strength from purity.
Well, that's a unique recipe.
He's a unique man, Your Majesty.
At the age of fourteen he could defeat any jouster in France.
His father, King Ban, made me his squire.
King Ban?
In France?
What did you say your name was?
Lancelot du Lac, Your Majesty.
You're Lancelot?
I was told you were coming.
You were told?
By Merlyn, the court magician.
He said to me one day...
"" Keep your eye out for a Frenchman called Lancelot du Lac.
He will come to the court of Camelot and he will be... ""
What was it now?
""He will be...""
Your ally, if you'll take me.
Your friend, who asks no friendship.
Your defender when you need one... whose body is your sword to brandish.
Did he prophesy that, Your Majesty?
For all that, I am.
Really, my dear fellow... this is far more than I could wish for... or even ask.
Then you will accept me?
Without hesitation.
- We will arrange for your knighthood.
- Oh, thank you!
We must arrange for your knighthood immediately.
No, Your Majesty.
All you know of me is words.
Invest me because of deeds, sire.
Give me an order.
- Now?
- This moment.
Send me on a mission.
Is there some wrong I can right?
Some enemy I can battle?
Some peril I can undertake?
Well, actually, there's not much going on today.
It's the first of May. The Queen and some of the court have gone a-Maying.
Gone a-Maying?
Yes, it's a sort of... picnic?
They eat berries and chase young girls around...
It's a custom we have here.
This is England, you know.
And this is the season for gathering flowers.
Knights gathering flowers?
Well, someone has to do it!
And besides, it's...
It's civilized.
And civilization should have... a few gentle hobbies.
Come.
I want you to meet the queen.
Dap, take the horses and feed them.
By George!
I suddenly remembered what Merlyn said of you.
How strange!
He said that you would be the greatest knight ever to sit at my table.
That was long before
I thought of a table.
So he knew it would exist.
Oh, dear!
I thought he meant a dining table.
But he meant this.
The Round Table!
And I have stumbled on my future.
I've done... the right thing.
Did you ever doubt it, Your Majesty?
Of course.
Only fools... never doubt.
Welcome, Lancelot.
Bless you for coming.
Welcome to my table.
It's May.
It's May.
The lusty month of May.
That lovely month.
When everyone goes.
Blissfully astray.
It's here, it's here.
That shocking time of year.
When tons of wicked little thoughts.
Merrily appear.
It's May!
That gorgeous holiday.
When every maiden itches for fun.
Wholesome or ""un"".
It's mad!
Depraved in every way.
Those dreary vows that everyone takes
Everyone breaks.
Everyone makes divine mistakes.
The lusty month of May.
The lusty month of May.
That darling month when everyone throws.
Self-control away.
It's time to do.
A wretched thing or two.
And try to make each precious day.
One you'll always rue.
The month of ""Yes, you may.""
A time for every.
Frivolous whim.
Proper or ""im.""
It's wild!
It's wild! It's gay!
A libelous display.
The birds and bees.
Will all of their vast
Amorous past.
Gaze at the human race Aghast!
The lusty.
Month of May!
Now then... which way to go?
North.
No, no, that's north.
No, that's north.
I'm completely lost.
Who's that rusty old fellow?
I've never seen him before,
Your Majesty.
Offer him assistance.
That mountain seems familiar.
Let's see.
Good day, my lord.
How do you do, young man.
The name of King Pellinore here.
You are a king, sire?
Of what country?
I don't know. I lost my kingdom.
To whom?
Well, I mislaid it.
I left it somewhere and I...
I can't find my way back.
- Why, I believe him.
- Your Majesty!
Your Majesty?
Yes, my lord. You are addressing
Her Majesty, the Queen of England.
The queen?
Why, why! How do you do?
Forgive me, Ma'am.
The beastly hinges need oiling.
Be at ease, my lord.
Welcome to Camelot.
Haven't I been here before?
Yes, years ago. I spent a jolly fortnight with a fine little fellow... called Wart.
Ever met him, Ma'am?
Constantly. He's my husband.
King Arthur of England.
The King? Is he?
Well, well! Is he?
By Jove, good for him!
That's what I call well done.
Imagine. The king!
And he knows the name of what he's king of.
Arthur would be pleased to see you.
Would you care to spend the night?
What, in a bed? In a real bed?
Damnation, I'd like that.
I haven't put spine to feathers since I left...
Since I left...
Go, one of you.
Escort His Majesty to the castle.
I'm very grateful to you, Ma'am.
Thank you, very much.
I want to present to you
Lancelot du Lac.
He's come all the way from France to join our Table.
This is the Lancelot that Merlyn used to speak of.
You're most welcome.
I'm honored to be among you, milady.
And allow me to pledge my eternal dedication to this noble cause.
Thank you, monsieur.
Arthur, I met this strange man...
This splendid dream must become a universal reality.
What?
Absolutely. It really must.
I have assured the king he may call upon me... at any time to perform any deed, no matter the danger.
Thank you, monsieur.
That's most comforting.
I'm always on duty.
Yes, I can see that.
I would love to come to lunch... but I want to listen to the plans that we have been discussing.
Explain it.
- To the queen, sire?
- Yes, of course.
Would not Madame find it tedious?
I have never found chivalry tedious.
So far.
May I remind you... that the Round Table happens to be the idea of my husband.
My husband's idea.
Any idea, milady... however exalted, could be improved.
- Really?
- Of course.
I've suggested that we create a training program for knights.
- Isn't that a marvelous idea, Jenny?
- A training program?
The Round Table must have a standard.
A standard physical and a standard moral.
And whose abilities would serve as a standard, monsieur?
Oh, certainly not mine, milady.
It would not be fair.
Not fair? In what way?
I would never ask anyone to live by my standards, milady.
To devote your life... to the tortured quest for perfection in body and spirit.
I would not ask that of anyone.
No, nor would I.
And have you achieved perfection, monsieur?
Physically, yes, milady.
But the refining of the soul is an endless struggle.
I dare say. I do daresay.
Do you mean you've never been defeated in battle or in a tournament?
No, Your Majesty.
And I gather... you consider it unlikely ever to happen in the future?
Highly, Your Majesty!
How was the channel, Lancelot?
Was it a good crossing?
Tell me a little of your struggle for the perfection of the spirit.
Have you jousted with humility lately?
""Humility,"" milady?
Humilité.
Or isn't it fashionable in France this year?
We had best discuss the program elsewhere. You look too beautiful... to have anything on your mind other than frolic and flowers.
Have a lovely day.
Same to all of you.
Come along, Lancelot.
Come quickly.
Good day, my queen.
- Mon dieu, he's unpleasant.
- And so poisonously good.
He probably walked across the channel.
Sir Dinadan?
When is the next tournament?
A week from Saturday, Your Majesty.
And who are the 3 best jousters we have?
Sir Lionel, Sir Sagramore... and with all humilitay...
I, Your Majesty.
Really?
Sir Lionel?
Do you recall the other night
That I distinctly said you might.
Serve as my escort
At the next town fair?
Well, I'm afraid there's someone
Who I must invite in place of you.
Someone who plainly is
Beyond compare.
The Frenchman's power is more tremendous.
Than I have ever seen anywhere.
And when a man is that stupendous.
He, by right, should take me
To the fair.
Your Majesty, let me tilt with him
And smite him.
Don't refuse me so abruptly
I implore.
Oh, give me the opportunity
To fight him.
And Gaul will be divided
Once more.
You will bash and thrash him?
I will smash and mash him!
You'll give him trouble?
He will be rubble.
A mighty whack?
His skull will crack!
Then you may.
Take me to the fair.
If you do all the things
You promise.
In fact, my heart will break
Should you not take me.
To the fair.
Sir Sagramore?
I have some rather painful news
Relative to the subject who's.
To be beside me at the next court ball.
You were the chosen one, I know
But it's tradition it should go.
To the unquestioned champion
In the hall.
And I'm convinced
That splendid Frenchman.
Can easily conquer one and all.
And besting all our local
Henchmen, he.
Should sit beside me At the ball.
I beg of you, Ma'am
Withhold your invitation.
I swear to you this challenge
Will be met.
And when I have finished up
The operation.
I shall serve him to Your Highness
En brochette.
You'll pierce right through him?
I'll barbecue him!
A wicked thrust?
It will be dust to dust.
From fore to aft?
He'll feel... a draft.
My goodness!
You may sit.
By me at the ball.
If you demolish him In battle.
In fact, I know I'd cry
Were you not by me.
At the ball.
Sir Dinadan?
Didn't I promise that you may
Guide me to London on the day.
That I go up to judge
The cattle show.
As it is quite a nasty ride
There must be someone by my side.
Who'II be defending me
From beast and foe.
So when I choose whom I prefer go.
I take the strongest knight I know.
And young du Lac seems strongest
Ergo.
He should.
Take me to the cattle show.
Your Majesty can't believe
This blustering prattle.
Let him prove it
With a sword or lance instead.
I promise you when I'm done
This gory battle.
His shoulders will be lonesome
For his head.
You'll disconnect him?
I'll vivisect him!
You'll open wide him?
I'll subdivide him!
Then you may guide me
To the show.
If you can carry out
Your program.
In fact, I'd grieve inside
Should you not guide me.
To the show.
Milady, We shall put an end to.
That Gallic bag of noise
And nerve.
When we do all that we Intend to.
He'll be a plate of French
Hors d'oeuvres.
I do applaud your noble goals.
Now let us see if you
Achieve them.
And if you do
Then you will be the three.
Who will go to the ball
To the show.
And take me.
To the fair.
My lords!
Have you seen the latest edict?
Tis the final straw.
Knights who refuse to lay down their arms will be attacked... as if they were serfs.
We're not only to kill foot soldiers, but knights as well.
We know all about it, Dinadan.
But these other knights... if they fight back... we could be killed.
What's the sense of being born in the upper class... if you can get killed like the lower class?
It has the stink of French cooking.
After Saturday... we shall be back on Yorkshire pudding.
Pelly, why don't you... give up searching for your kingdom... and come settle down with us for good?
That's jolly kind of you, Arthur.
I mean, I love the bed and all that... but the truth is I don't find things too restful around here.
I can't help wishing that you'd stop... thinking... and leave well enough alone.
I'm all against these new ideas of yours.
Any new ideas.
Best people whacking best people.
That's not right. That's not.
The chaps downstairs, they're gnashing mad.
Gnashing.
It's all his fault, you know.
Emperor Charlemagne there.
He has no activities, that's his trouble.
No secular pleasures.
Quiet, Pelly!
But do you not have any activities?
Any hobbies? Any... chambre à coucher?
No, Pellinore.
There, you see. Do you see?
Now why can't he be like the other chaps instead of like himself?
Why can't he come home of an evening, hang up his shield... and do something that he can be ashamed of?
You sure he's French?
I'm afraid my lord is right.
All fanatics are irritating, Pellinore.
And I am a fanatic.
And I don't enjoy it any more than you do.
Didn't you have a change to suggest?
We can discuss my idea tomorrow.
If you will excuse me.
While I was napping, did I miss any improvements in chivalry?
No, milady.
If you will excuse me...
Monsieur, when you're arranging things with God tonight... do be sure to give us fine weather tomorrow.
Good night, sire.
Good night, Pellinore.
Good night.
Heard the latest? He believes his purity gives him miraculous powers.
He was undoubtedly referring to his physical prowess.
Which is vast, indeed.
We'll see about that tomorrow.
Sagramore, Lionel and Dinadan have all challenged him to a joust.
Three damn strong men!
- All three in one day?!
- Quite, exactly.
Isn't it marvelous? Marvelous!
Exactly, yes!
I tell you, Arthur.
I've never met anyone like him.
I mean... he has no lady.
Talks to no one but you and God... crammed full of religion, an all-around unpleasant fellow.
I can't wait until tomorrow.
It'll be a jolly massacre.
Good night, Ma'am.
I'm really looking forward to it.
It's going to be marvelous.
A note of thanks from Sir Lionel.
I've promised he can carry my kerchief in the joust tomorrow.
I would be most grateful if you... would withdraw your permission from Sir Lionel.
I don't think I could.
It would be rather awkward.
Then allow Lancelot to carry it against Sagramore.
- I've promised my kerchief to him.
- Then against Dinadan?
I've promised him too.
He asked so prettily, I couldn't refuse.
This is appalling!
It will seem to the court that you are championing his defeat.
Perhaps he won't be. He knocked you unconscious. You became friends.
He may knock them out, and they'll all take a house together.
I realize he's having a difficult time adjusting.
But he's a stranger.
He's not even English.
He's French.
Well, he suffers in translation.
I ask you...
I believe you're jealous of the knights and their attentions to me.
Jealous? What absolute rubbish!
You know I am delighted the court adores you so.
I trust you as God above.
You have dragged me off the subject and I want you back on it.
Will you withdraw those kerchiefs?
Only if you command me as king.
If I do... will you forgive me?
Never.
Then, if I ask you as a husband, will you as a favor?
I find him overbearing and pretentious.
The knights are against him.
Can we not stay on the subject?
There's nothing more to be said.
If the king wishes me to withdraw what I have given... let him command me and Yours Humbly will graciously obey.
Blast you, Merlyn!
This is all your fault!
You swore that you had taught me
Everything from A to Z.
With nary an omission in between.
Well, I shall tell you what
You obviously forgot.
That's how a ruler rules a queen.
And what of teaching me
By turning me to animal and bird.
From beaver
To the smallest bobolink?
I should have had a whirl
At changing to a girl.
To learn the way the creatures think.
But wasn't there a night.
On a summer long gone by.
We passed a couple
Wrangling away.
And did I not say.
Merlyn What if that chap were I.
And did he not give counsel
And say.
What was it now?
Oh, my mind's a wall.
Oh, yes! By Jove!
Now I recall.
How to handle a woman.
There's a way
Said the wise old man.
A way known by every woman.
Since the whole rigmarole began.
Do I flatter her
I begged him answer.
Do I threaten or cajole or plead.
Do I brood or play the gay romancer.
Said he, smiling No, indeed!
How to handle a woman
Mark me well
I will tell you, sir.
The way to handle a woman.
Is to love her.
Simply.
Love her.
Merely love her.
Love her.
What's wrong, Jenny?
Where are you these days?
What are you thinking?
I don't understand you.
But no matter.
Merlyn told me once...
""Never be disturbed if you don't understand what a woman is thinking.""
""They don't do it very often.""
But what do you do while they're doing it?
How to handle a woman
Mark me well
And I'll tell you, sir.
The way to handle a woman.
Is to love her.
Simply.
Love her.
Merely love her.
Love her.
Just... love her.
Here comes Sir Lionel.
One.
Watch the way Sir Sagramore maneuvers his horse. It's extraordinary.
You see how he drives to the right?
And then suddenly...
How clever!
He maneuvered his horse right out from under himself.
What control!
Two, Jenny.
He's dead, Jenny.
Please!
Live!
Live!
I beg you.
He lives!
I'm trembling with fear.
And the strength... has left my arms.
And terrible feelings... burn within me.
Tell me.
You're older than I.
You know this earth... better than I.
I only fell upon it... a few hours ago.
What are you talking about?
Guenevere.
Wait, Pelly.
You've never been in love... have you, Pelly?
Once.
But not lately.
Now I'm not young enough.
Or not old enough.
And I'm too young and too old.
Too old not to know that fears... can be imaginary.
And too young not to be... tormented by them.
Forgive me, milady, for disturbing you.
Clarinda told me
Arthur was expected here.
Yes, he is.
I love you.
God forgive me... but I do!
Then God forgive us both, Lance.
What a glorious day!
This is your day, Lance.
And at last you shall receive... your earned and proper knighthood.
Unfortunately, sainthood is not in my power.
Before the ceremony, we three will have a nice quiet drink together.
It was on such a day as this... that the idea of the Round Table was given birth.
Remember, Jenny?
To the Round Table!
To be invested...
Knight of the Round Table of England... of the Castle of Joyous Gard...
Lancelot du Lac.
Excalibur.
Arise...
Sir Lancelot.
Proposition:
If I could choose... from every woman who breathes on this earth... the face I would most love... the smile, the touch, the heart... the voice, the laugh, the soul itself... every detail and feature to the last strand of the hair... they would all be Jenny's.
Proposition:
If I could choose from every man who breathes on this earth... a man for my brother... a man for my son... and a man for my friend... they would all be Lance.
I love them.
I love them and they answer me with pain... and torment.
Be it sin or not sin... they have betrayed me in their hearts... and that's far sin enough.
I can see it in their eyes.
I can feel it when they speak.
And they must pay for it and be punished.
I shall not be wounded and not return it in kind.
I'm through with feeble hoping.
I demand... a man's vengeance!
Proposition:
I'm a king... not a man.
And a very civilized king.
Could it... possibly be civilized... to destroy the thing I love?
Could it possibly be civilized to love myself above all?
What about their pain... and their torment?
Did they ask for this calamity?
Can passion... be selected?
Is there any doubt... of their devotion to me, and to our Table?
By God...
I shall be a king!
This is the time of King Arthur... when we shall... reach for the stars!
This is the time of King Arthur... when violence is not strength, and compassion is not weakness.
We are civilized!
Resolved:
We shall live through this together!
Excalibur!
They... you... and I.
And may...
God have mercy on us all.
Your Majesty!
I come as an emissary from the village of Glenfield.
We have 23 shops... and not one door with a bolt.
And not a chain on a stable... a bar on a gate, a latch with a lock.
And our children walk free on the roads.
Because we live in the England of King Arthur.
Here are the keys of Glenfield,
Your Majesty.
We need them no more.
You have been the queen's lover for years.
Get on your feet... and defend your slander!
Does killing me kill the truth?
There's a poison in this court that will kill us all!
Get up and fight!
I give you this.
And I'll use dagger alone.
I... take it back.
If the king grants you clemency... you shall be banished.
If not, you hang.
Clemency is granted.
Is he dead?
Bruce has withdrawn the accusation.
And Arthur?
Clemency.
What an agony for him.
Seven of his knights banished.
If those charges had not been withdrawn... what would I have done?
Commit murder?
I don't know.
At least he's still spared the anguish of the truth.
He knows.
- I'm certain.
- He couldn't.
Arthur would never banish the knights so unjustly.
It's your conscience talking.
It's impatient for you to be punished.
He knows!
Well, why would he change the law?
Rule out the use of swords to settle disputes... and replace it with a court and judge?
- He hasn't done that.
- He's preparing to!
And if no evidence can be produced... then the matters cannot be disputed at all.
And there will be no evidence.
- He'll see to that.
- How?
He will never leave this castle unless one of us is with him.
He will never leave us alone again.
Never!
Oh, God!
What will become of us?
What will become of me?
How long can I... go on asking the same question and not lose my mind?
Or is my mind gone from me now?
What shall we do?
I know what I should do.
Leave and never come back.
Today. This minute.
But to leave so abruptly... it would seem a confession.
Better in a week or two.
Or a month.
How can I go, Jenny.
Look at you.
When would I?
If ever I would leave you.
It wouldn't be in summer.
Seeing you in summer
I never would go.
Your hair streaked with sunlight.
Your lips red as flame.
Your face with a luster.
That puts gold to shame.
But if I'd ever leave you.
It couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn
I never would know
I've seen how you sparkle.
When fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn.
And I must be there.
And I could leave you.
Running merrily through the snow.
Or on a wintery evening.
When you catch the fire's glow.
If ever I would leave you.
How could it be in springtime.
Knowing how in spring
I'm bewitched by you so.
Oh, no Not in springtime.
Summer, winter or fall.
No, never could I leave you.
At all.
I want you to go, Lance.
I do.
I don't worry about the future.
We have none.
But if anything happened to the past... any more shame... and any more guilt could make ruin of it.
The past is all I have.
If ever I would leave you.
How could it be in springtime.
Knowing how in spring
I'm bewitched by you so.
Oh, no Not in springtime.
Summer, winter or fall.
No, never could I leave you.
At all.
Damn it, Arthur!
Forgive me, damn it.
But damn it!
If this banishing goes on... there'II be more out there than there are in here.
There's a young man from Scotland who brings you royal greetings.
His Majesty is occupied.
Ask him to return in the afternoon.
The uglier the truth, the truer the friend that tells you... and unless you are told the truth... your Round Table is doomed.
Guenevere... and Lancelot... have betrayed you.
And because you don't know it... innocent men are being punished.
You will either... withdraw that treasonous allegation... at once... or defend it with your life!
Now speak up!
Which is it, Pellinore?
The sword or withdrawal?
Guard!
Wait!
I must have been mistaken, Sir.
Under this new civil law of mine you can... make that accusation again without fear of your life... if there is evidence, which there is not, of course.
Repetition, Pelly, is not evidence.
Brilliant, Your Majesty!
Not only wise but clever.
- How dare you enter unannounced?
- But I was announced.
And were you not informed to return this afternoon?
I'm busy this afternoon.
By Jove!
- What presumption!
- Don't touch me. I'm unarmed.
Pelly, call the guard and have this pompous young ass thrown out.
Yes, do.
Tell them His Majesty wants Mordred evicted.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm Mordred.
Wait, Pelly.
I know this boy.
He's... the brother... the half-brother...
He's the son... of the Princess Margause of Orkny.
Please.
This is the famous throne room where sits His Majesty, King of England.
It's quite handsome, really.
Marvelous for parties.
I had lost track of the time.
You've grown to manhood.
How... is your mother?
As ravishing as ever.
Which is hardly surprising.
Vigilant selfishness is wonderful for the skin.
And Prince Claudius?
I haven't seen him in a while.
He locked himself... in a tower 4 years ago to get away from Mother.
Do you always sit there, or do you sometimes switch with Guenevere?
Protocol intrigues me.
And where is the famous Lancelot?
Or does he stand in between?
What brings you to Camelot?
A desire of blood, Your Majesty.
My brothers are here.
Half-brothers.
They'll be very, very, very miserable to see me.
Mother had a potion which took off
10 years and they... gave it to me when I was 9 to make me minus one.
You've come all this way to see your brothers, whom you detest?
That's hardly reason for such a long journey.
There's you, Your Majesty.
I always wondered why old Claudius detested me so.
Then one day Mother told me the marvelous news.
He's not my father.
How once when she was visiting England... she met an attractive young lad called Arthur... invited him to her room... so on.
Is that how the story goes?
Yes, that's how the story goes.
Imagine her surprise when that young man became King of all England.
Now that you're here, what are your plans?
My plans are your wishes, Your Majesty.
Then you are to remain in Camelot and become a knight of the Round Table.
I admit you're not very promising material... but you have brains, youth... and a proper heritage.
Much could be done if you applied yourself.
I a knight?
Come, Your Majesty!
Look at me!
I despise the sword, I loathe the spear, and I detest horses.
I've been taught to place needs ahead of conscience... comfort ahead of principle.
I find charity offensive and kindness a trap.
I like my ladies married... my willpower weak, my wine strong... and my saints fallen.
Come.
What kind of knight could you make of me?
Put it that way, it would take a miracle.
And I'm told there's a shortage of miracles at Camelot these days.
I must warn you, Mordred... that I am a civilized man with occasional lapses.
And far more seasoned rascals than you have polished their souls.
I advise you get out the wax.
Better be rubbed clean... than rubbed out?
You will dine with the queen and me... and try to get to know each other better.
Good, I shall look forward to meeting the queen.
You will leave when you are dismissed.
And remember... that I and I alone shall decide... when you may address me by the name that your kinship allows.
But it shall remain unspoken... till you have earned the right by proper deeds.
The adage...
""Blood is thicker than water"" was invented by... undeserving relatives.
I look forward to seeing you tonight.
It is simple, Pellinore.
Once you get it into that armored head of yours... that all disputes will be settled by law... and not by bloodshed.
Wart, I understand that perfectly.
I do not understand how it works.
Let us see. Supposing you are accused of burning down a stable.
Whose?
Let us say a farmer named William.
I wouldn't, of course, but get along.
Now Pelly, you claim you haven't.
What does he do?
He holds his tongue if he knows what's good for him... or he'll get a sword through his chest.
Pelly, he takes you to court.
And we fight there.
In court, there is a prosecutor for Farmer William... and a defender for you.
Oh, I see!
I see. And they fight.
A jury decides.
That is why it is called ""trial by jury.""
The jury?
Who in thunderation are they?
It's none of their damn business.
But you don't know them, Pelly.
And they don't know you.
If they don't know me and they don't know Farmer William... how can you expect them to care a fig who wins?
How can you get a fair decision from people so impartial?
That is precisely the point, Pelly.
They are impartial and there will be no bloodshed.
If that jury finds me guilty, there'II be plenty of bloodshed.
I'll have a whack at every last one of them.
Then you will be charged with murder, Pelly.
The ruddy thing's endless!
Another jury finds me guilty, and I'll have to whack them... and so on and so on and whacking and...
Forget it!
You will never burn down a stable... you will never know a farmer named William and you will never... ever be found in a court.
Not without my ruddy sword, I won't.
Jenny, I'm getting old.
It's true.
I thought about it this morning.
I walked to the stables as briskly as ever... and arrived much later than I expected to.
You've been closeted far too long with the civil court.
I'm glad it's finally opening.
- The first English court.
- May I attend the ceremony?
Would you, Jenny?
Everyone would love it.
Yes, of course.
It may be our greatest achievement.
Good day, milady.
Good day, Lance.
Arthur, it's about Mordred.
Must we talk about Mordred?
This is the first day in a month he'll not be here for dinner... and that makes it seem like a party.
Get rid of him.
He's bent on the destruction of the Table.
He's setting knight against knight.
Making them yearn for their own lands.
Every evening like a witch over a cauldron he mixes wine and disloyalty.
I know of his activities, Lance.
Do you also know he is in constant touch with the knights you banished?
And they're raising an army.
I know.
And it is my own fault.
I should have officially recognized him when I took the throne.
It is the proper procedure.
I intended to do it and I should have done it.
But I didn't.
I couldn't.
I hadn't... counted on... caring for Jenny as much... and I had hoped that one day our child would sit... on the throne of England.
The fates... have not been kind.
The fates... must not have the last word, Lance.
We have been through much together, we three.
And by the sword, Excalibur, we will go through this.
Mordred is filled with hatred, trying to destroy those I love... and trying to make his inheritance come faster.
But we must not give him the opportunity.
We must not let... our passions destroy our dreams.
Let him cross my path.
I'll run him through.
You will not, Lance.
He's your mortal enemy!
He's my son.
He's all there is of me.
The only child I will ever have.
It may be madness, but somehow I hope that there is... something of me in him that I can reach.
So I will have your word, Lance?
You have my word.
Would you like to be alone, Arthur?
No, please. Please don't go.
What did you do today, Jenny?
Just trivial things.
That's exactly what I want to hear about.
Tempests and tea cups... mountains made out of molehills, anything.
Anything you can think of... that is not fit for a king.
What do the simple folk do.
To help them escape when they're blue.
The shepherd who is ailing
The milkmaid who is glum.
The cobbler who is wailing
From nailing his thumb.
When they're beset and besieged.
The folks not noblesse-Iy obliged.
However do they manage
To shed their weary lot.
Oh, what.
Do simple folk do.
We do not.
I have been informed
By those who know them well.
They find relief in quite a clever way.
When they're sorely pressed
They whistle for a spell.
And whistling seems
To brighten up their day.
And that's what.
Simple folk do.
So they say.
They just whistle?
So they say.
What else do the simple folk do.
To perk up the heart and get through?
The wee folk and the grown folk
Who wander to and fro.
Have ways known to their own folk
We throne-folk don't know.
When all the doldrums begin.
What keeps each of them in his skin.
What ancient native custom
Provides the needed glow.
Oh, what.
Do simple folk do?
Do you know?
Once along the road
I came upon a lad.
Singing in a voice
Three times his size.
And when I asked him why
He told me he was sad.
And singing always made his spirits rise.
So that's.
What simple folk do.
I surmise.
Arise, my love, arise my love
Apollo's lighting the skies, my love.
The meadows shine with columbine
And daffodils blossom away.
Hear Venus call to one and all
Come taste delight while you may.
The world is bright, and all is right
And life is merry and gay.
What else do the simple folk do?
They must have a system or two.
They obviously outshine us
At turning tears to mirth.
Have tricks a royal highness
Is minus from birth.
What, then, I wonder Do they.
To chase all the goblins away.
They have some tribal sorcery
You haven't mentioned yet.
Oh, what.
Do simple folk do.
To forget?
Often, I am told
They dance a fiery dance.
And whirl till they're
Completely uncontrolled.
Soon the mind is blank
And all are in a trance.
A violent trance astounding to behold.
And that's.
What simple folk do.
So I'm told.
- Really?
- I have it on the best authority.
Stop it!
For God's sake, stop it!
Through the clouds gray with years.
Over hills wet with tears.
To a world young and free.
We will fly Follow me
April green everywhere.
April's song always there.
Come and hear Come and see.
Follow me.
Merlyn's schoolhouse.
To a tree.
Where our hopes hang high.
To a dream that should never die.
Where our long lost tomorrows.
Still are in the sweet... bye and bye.
Time goes by Or do we.
Close your eyes And you'll see.
As we were We can be.
Weep no more Follow me.
Hello!
Hello...
Wart!
Hello...
Wart.
What's the best thing for being sad?
You taught me once.
The best thing for being sad is to learn something.
Learn something?
It's the one thing, Wart, that never fails.
You may grow old... and trembling in your arteries.
You may lie awake at night... listening to the disorder of your veins.
You may miss your father, your mother... your dog... your only love.
My love.
There's only one thing for all of it.
Learn.
Learn... why the world wags... and what wags it.
How could I learn if I couldn't think?
And I couldn't think, so I couldn't learn.
Not even to think the thought,
I thought.
But even the thought,
""I'm not thinking a thought""... is thinking, isn't it?
Thinking is something to get into the habit of making use of... as often as possible.
Thinking helps in everything.
Everything but love, that is.
Love is a sort of... seventh day.
So thinking can rest.
But this is not Sunday, so look down.
Look into the water, Wart.
Tell me what you see.
Water... fish and us.
Forget the water.
Forget us, and think of the fish.
Think yourself a fish.
Feel yourself a fish.
Breathe with your gills.
Be a fish.
Well, how do you like it?
How big a fish am I? I just saw a big fish chasing a smaller fish.
Am I the dinner or the diner?
Work it out. Think!
What are you learning as a fish?
Not very much. Big fish eat little fish, just like everywhere else.
Except somehow that doesn't seem right, does it?
Why couldn't I be a bird?
I would really enjoy being...
What am I?
You're a hawk!
Has the hunting season started?
By George, I believe it has!
I'm flying higher!
Look down. Tell me what you see.
I see lakes... trees, forests.
Can you see Camelot?
Yes, I can.
Can you see the next county?
Yes! I can see the middle of it.
It's Greylock Valley, but I can't see the edges of it.
You see the edges when you're down here?
Of course I can.
The boundaries are clearly marked.
Then what do you know as a hawk... that you don't know as Arthur?
Think!
I'm not thinking.
I'm just gliding!
Are you alone?
Not now.
Isn't this rather far from the palace for you, Mordred?
I wanted to see this legendary forest you've told me so much about.
This is where Merlyn taught you, is it not?
Yes, it is.
There are times when the only vacation spot in the world... is the past.
I can't quite remember all that Merlyn taught me, but I do remember this.
That happiness is a virtue.
No one can be... happy and wicked.
Triumphant, perhaps, but not happy.
If I could teach you that... and make you believe it... then at last, you could be my son.
Are you happy, Your Majesty?
Yes.
Is the queen?
Yes.
And Lancelot?
What are you implying?
Nothing, Your Majesty.
Simply that I did not realize... that deception and infidelity were candidates for the badge of virtue.
Whom are you accusing?
And of what crime?
And with what proof?
Isn't your Civil Law marvelous?
No proof, no crime.
Ergo:
Virtue, happiness.
You want me to be your son.
No more than I.
Then prove to me I'm wrong.
Stay in the forest tonight.
Give your son the lesson of this life.
Show him how virtue can triumph without the help of... fear?
Return to the palace... and inform the court... that His Majesty will be hunting all through the night... and will return... in the midmorning.
Yes... my lord.
Merlyn.
Where are you?
Merlyn...
Get to them.
Warn them.
Tell them to be wise.
My lords!
Both of you!
Are you drunk or mad!
Directly under the king's window!
The king's not there.
- He's away for the night.
- Where?
Hunting.
He'll be back at midmorning.
I must get back to the castle myself.
I must get back!
Jenny, come away with me.
To Joyous Gard.
Let's have it open and aboveboard.
I cannot live like this another day.
And this man we both love... what would you do, force him to declare war on you?
Where either you or he or both would be killed? And hundreds of others?
I never wanted to love you.
Your God arranged it.
Your God must solve it.
Arthur is my husband. I must stay with him as long as he wants me.
Then so be it, Jenny.
I will... never ask you again.
Nor shall I come to you again.
I swear it.
And I will never come to you again.
I loved you.
Once in silence.
And misery was all I knew.
Trying so.
To keep my love from showing.
All the while not knowing.
You loved me too.
Yes, loved me.
In lonesome silence.
Your heart.
Filled with dark despair.
Thinking love.
Would flame in you forever.
And I'd never, never.
Know the flame was there.
Then one day we cast away
Our secret longing.
The raging tide we held inside
Would hold no more.
The silence.
At last was broken.
We flung wide.
Our prison door.
Every joyous word of love.
Was spoken.
And now there's
Twice as much grief.
Twice the strain for us.
Twice the despair Twice the pain.
For us.
As we had known... before.
The silence.
At last was broken.
We flung wide Our prison door.
Every joyous word of love.
Was spoken.
And after all had been said.
Here we are, my love.
Silent once more.
And not far.
My love!
From where we were... before.
Don't reach for your dagger.
I accuse you of treason and order you both to stand trial... for your crime.
Surrender in the king's name.
Take him! Take him!
You cowards!
Guard! That man!
Oh, no!
Guenevere, Guenevere.
Oh they found Guenevere.
In the dying candle's gleam.
Came the sundown Of a dream.
On a day dark and drear.
Came to trial Guenevere.
Ruled the jury For her shame.
She will be sentenced
To the flame.
Verdict:
Guilty of treason against king and country.
Sentence:
To be burned
At the stake until death!
Guenevere, Guenevere.
Lance will save Guenevere.
Any moment he'll appear.
And he'll rescue Guenevere.
Five a.m. Oh, it's near.
Not a sound do I hear.
And the bells
Will soon ring clear.
Won't he rescue.
Guenevere?
Oh hurry, Lancelot, hurry
There isn't too much time.
Oh hurry, or soon those evil bells
In the tower will chime.
Oh hurry, the guard will soon
Be gathering around the stake.
And soon they will come
To take Guenevere.
Where is the King?
He's supposed to watch the execution.
He's supposed to be here, at this window. It's the law, isn't it?
Do you think for one moment
Lancelot will not rescue her?
But if he tries... that means that Arthur will have to fight him, won't he?
Is there no rescue in sight?
No, not yet, Sir.
Your Majesty, why not ignore... the verdict and pardon her?
But you can't do that, can you?
Let her die, your life is over.
Let her live, your life's a fraud.
Kill the queen or the law.
Wart!
I'm afraid... you must come to the window.
The executioner is waiting... for your signal.
- Is it Lancelot?
- I don't know.
Is it, Pelly?
It is!
Wart, my dear fellow... it is!
Sweet Heaven, what a sight!
Can you see it from there, Arthur?
Can you see your goodly Lancelot murdering your goodly knights?
Sire... most of the guard... is killed.
And over 80 knights.
They must be heading for the channel.
We'll make ready the army to follow.
We want revenge! Revenge!
Your table has cracked, Arthur.
Shall I save the timbers for her next stake?
Merlyn... make me a hawk.
Let me... fly away from here.
We want to return with you.
Let us pay for what we've done.
At the stake?
For what end? Justice?
They've forgotten justice.
They want revenge.
Revenge... the most worthless of causes.
It's too late.
The Table is dead.
It exists no more.
Half my knights were killed in the yard.
Mordred is organizing an army against me.
The rest of the knights are in their tents... itching for dawn, cheerful.
Cheerful to be at war.
It's those old uncivilized days... come back again.
Those days... those dreadful days that we tried... to put asleep forever.
It is your wish that this dread battle go on?
It is not my wish!
I can think no longer of what to do except to ride the tide of events.
Oh, what folly!
All we've been through... for nothing except an idea.
Something that you cannot taste... or touch, smell... or feel.
Without... substance, without life... reality... memory.
The charade will soon begin.
Please, please.
Please, go back to Joyous Gard.
Jenny is not at Joyous Gard.
She is with the Holy Sisters.
Is there nothing to be done?
There's nothing to be done... but to play out the game... and leave the decisions to God.
Go now, Lance.
You must go too, Jenny.
I know.
So often, in the past...
I would look in your eyes and I would find there forgiveness.
Perhaps one day, in the future... it shall be there again.
But I won't be with you.
I won't see it.
Goodbye... my love.
My dearest love.
Who's there?
Who's there?
Come out, I say!
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
I was searching for the Sergeant of Arms and got lost.
I did not wish to disturb you.
Who are you?
Where did you come from?
You ought to be in bed.
Are you a page?
I stowed away on one of the boats, Your Majesty.
I came to fight for the Round Table.
I'm very good with a bow.
And do you intend to kill people with this bow of yours?
Oh, yes, my lord!
A great many, I hope!
But supposing that they... killed you?
Then I shall be dead, my lord.
But I don't intend to be dead.
I intend to be a knight!
A knight?
Yes, my lord.
Of the Round Table.
And when did you decide upon this extinct profession?
Was your village once protected by knights?
Did your father serve a knight?
Was your mother once saved by a knight?
Oh, no, my lord! I'd never even seen a knight until I stowed away.
I only know of them... the stories people tell!
From the stories people tell... you wish to become... a knight?
Now tell me, what do you think you know of the Knights of the Round Table?
I know everything, milord.
Might for right!
Right for right!
Justice for all!
A Round Table where all knights would sit.
Everything!
Come.
- What's your name?
- It is Tom, my lord.
- Where do you come from?
- From Warwick, my lord.
Now listen to me, Tom of Warwick.
You won't fight in the battle, understand?
Yes, my lord.
You will run behind the lines and hide until it is over.
And then you will return home... to England... alive.
To grow up... and grow old.
You understand?
You will remember... what I, the King, tell you... and do as I command.
Each evening.
From December to December.
Before you drift to sleep
Upon your cot.
Think back on all the tales
That you remember.
Of Camelot.
Ask every person
If he's heard the story.
And tell it strong and clear
If he has not.
That once there was
A fleeting wisp of glory.
Called Camelot.
Now say it out With love and joy.
Yes, Camelot... my boy.
Where once it never rained
Till after sundown.
By eight a.m. the morning fog had flown.
Don't let it be forgot.
That once there was a spot.
For one brief shining moment.
That was known as
Camelot!
Give me that sword.
Kneel, Tom.
With this sword Excalibur...
I knight you Sir Tom of Warwick.
And I command you... to return home... and carry out my orders.
Yes, my lord!
What are you doing?
You have a battle to fight.
I have won my battle, Pelly.
And here... is my victory!
What we did will be remembered.
You'll see.
Now run, Sir Tom.
Behind the lines!
Who was that?
One of what we all are, Pelly.
Less than a drop in the great blue motion of the sunlit sea.
But it seems that some of the drops sparkle!
Some of them do sparkle!
Run, boy!
Oh, run... my boy!
Oh Charlie, I'm on time, right?
Wrong... Guess what?
I was looking at furniture.
Couches, chairs and lamps that turn into beds.
Then I went to look at wedding rings, then looked for my trousseau.
And that's not all.
I went to the bank.
I took every last cent I own.
All 427 dollars!
So now we can put a down payment on something.
Oh Charlie, it's such a great world!
Today New York's my personal property
Right down Broadway to City Hall.
Every supermarket, every five-and-ten
All of Lincoln Center and the UN
They're all my personal property
The zoo in Central Park is merely my private menagerie
I've carved my name on every tree
From Yonker's Raceway to
Bowling Green, I own everything
It's all my personal property
The planetarium is mine alone
The old aquarium I also own
And since I feel today
New York's my own personal property
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
Since I like you very much
So very, very much
I'm gonna split it with you
With you...
Charlie, this is my own personal wishing well.
Hey! Let's make a wish, and throw something in for luck.
Since I like you very much
So very, very much
I'm gonna give it to...
I wish...
Help!
I can't swim!
Help! Help me!
I can't swim!
Look, there's a girl drowning!
- Don't look, dear.
Don't get involved.
It's none of our business!
Get her up.
- Somebody help.
Doesn't she look dead to you?
- Don't know. Never seen her before.
Shake her!
That's it, she's coming to.
Oh my God, I'm in Australia!
Put me down!
What are you doing? Go away!
Don't look at me!
Take it easy, honey. You almost drowned. - Where's Charlie?
I bet she tried to knock herself off.
- Over a fellow named Charlie.
Where's my shoe?
Don't stare at me!
Please leave me alone!
Please leave me alone!
Come on, everybody.
Let's all go home!
Why did you do this, Charlie?
The show is all over.
- Be careful, she's a crazy lady!
You all right, Miss?
I'm fine. I'm just fine.
Just put it down in your book:
"The crazy, drowned lady feels fine."
All right.
Do you care to tell us what happened?
I lost my shoe.
Look for her other shoe, will ya?
- Yeah, look for her other shoe.
What's it look like?
- It looks like that one!
All right, what's your name?
Charity.
Charity Hope Valentine.
- Charity Hope Valentine?
Just write it.
- I found it!
Address?
- 615 West 44th Street.
Occupation?
- Social consultant.
Where?
- The Fandango Ballroom.
Dance hall hostess.
You work in one of those tango palaces? - It's temporary.
Length of employment?
- Eight years.
Suppose you tell me what you were doing in the water.
Well, my fiancé Charlie...
He's not exactly my fiancé, but we are engaged to be wed the minute his marriage breaks up.
We had this rendezvous to meet.
I was about to make a wish by throwing in this penny, when I guess I must have slipped,
'cause I lost my balance.
Naturally, he made a grab for me, and all he caught was my handbag.
And I fell in.
- Yeah!
Sure.
- Where's my hairspray?
He couldn't jump in after me
'cause of his bad back.
So he went off to get help.
- Where, Norfolk, Virginia?
Come on, honey, didn't you leave one tiny detail out?
Like what? - Like there ain't one word of truth in it.
Hello, men!
Nickie, did ya hear about Charity and her boyfriend?
You're gonna get married?
All the luck in the world, baby!
He stole her money and pushed her in the lake. - He wasn't for you.
Excuse me, ladies.
Prince Philip walked in.
So park the gum and drag it out.
Doesn't he ever knock?
- Good thing we're decent.
He's gonna call.
- Who?
Charlie. He's gonna call.
Any minute, he's gonna call and have a logical explanation.
What did I tell ya?
Charlie!
Yeah?
You know what your problem is?
You run your heart like a hotel.
You got guys checking in and out.
- And always get stuck with the bill.
This time it's different.
He loves me.
When somebody has their name tattooed on your arm, does that sound like a guy who'll push you in a lake for 427 bucks?
Yeah. - Sure!
- Where's my hairspray?
Forget him. We got a living to make.
If you call this a living.
He's gonna call. You'll see.
Sure.
Since I like you very much
So very, very much
I'm...
Oh Charlie...
Mister, can I talk to you a minute?
- Got a cigarette for me, Mister?
Do you speak Spanish?
- Hey, Tiger, wanna dance?
Come here, I wanna tell ya something.
Oh, you're so tall!
- Let's have some fun.
The minute you walked in the joint
I saw you're a man of distinction
A real big spender
Good-looking, so refined
Say, wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind?
So let me get right to the point
I don't pop my cork for every guy
Hey, big spender!
Spend... a little time with me
Do you wanna have fun?
How's about a few laughs?
I can show you a good time
Do you wanna have fun?
How's about a few laughs?
Fun, laughs, fun, laughs
Fun, laughs, good time...
How's about a few laughs?
I could give you...
Are you ready for some fun?
Or would you like... Let me show you... a good time
Hey, big spender!
Hey, big spender!
The minute you walked in the joint
I saw you're a man of distinction...
How's about it, Bowsy?
You got a dollar?
Hey Hermie, anybody been asking for me?
Face it, honey,
Charlie ain't coming anymore.
What's the matter with me?
Boy, am I a pushover!
No, not a pushover, exactly.
It's just that you're too...
You just keep on...
Yeah, you're a pushover.
If he stole your purse, call the cops.
They can pick him up.
Girl, do you know how many guys there are carrying pocket books?
Why did he do it?
Everything he wanted, I bought him.
11-dollar shirts,
79-dollar Italian silk suits.
What did I do wrong?
I didn't get up in the middle of the night and buy meatball sandwiches.
He loved his meatball sandwiches!
I've had it to here with that creep!
Go baby!
- He can go slip and slide his greasy head on somebody else's shoulder.
I'm finished. I'm through, hear me?
I'm tired of buying him his pointed shoes, and his trips to Florida, and his three-horse parlays.
Who does he think he is?
Shoving girls in the lake.
Oh boy, am I through giving!
I hope your tight Italian pants choke you to death!
Get me a taxi!
Ursula, stop acting like a child.
Vittorio Vitale!
That's Vittorio Vitale, the Italian movie star!
Ursula, I can explain everything.
Don't touch me. We're through!
I hate you! D'you hear me?
She really loathes him!
Ursula, I merely said "hello" to that girl. "Hello", that's all.
I do not want to discuss this.
- You can't walk out on me like this!
I can't? Just watch me!
Just watch me!
- You're not watching!
Where's my taxi?
Taxi! Taxi!
You're coming back inside.
- I am not. - Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are!
Ursula. Ursula!
Ursula!
Oh, scusi, signorina.
- My pleasure!
Are you busy tonight?
- He wants to know if you're busy.
No, you!
Yes, you.
Me?
- Are you busy tonight?
What time?
- Right now.
Right now is very good for me.
- Get in.
I'm with him.
That girl! She's driving me crazy.
These wild fits of jealousy.
I can't stand it. She's impossible.
That was my first impression.
- Childish, neurotic, selfish...
That was my second impression.
- Well, it's finished.
She's just not worth it.
- Well.
On the other hand, she's not bad in the looks department.
Yes, you're right.
She is very beautiful.
If you go for that sort of thing.
- No, you are right.
She is... gorgeous.
I think I just screwed myself up.
I'm with him.
Who's that with Vittorio?
- She's not familiar.
Who can she be?
- What happened to Ursula?
Who is it?
It's me!
Wow, it's crawling with celebrities.
I'm the only person I never heard of.
Excuse me, Signor Vitale.
There is a phone call.
It's Ursula. Look how she knows me.
No matter where I go, she finds me.
Well, I know her too. She'll cry and plead with me to come to her.
What should I do? Be magnanimous and forgive her, or be aloof?
Aloof sounds good.
- Think so?
The aloofer the better.
- I am not here.
Now I really feel great.
I could eat a horse.
I was only kidding!
- Now we dance!
I wasn't hungry anyway.
So sorry, really I am.
- It's all right.
Where are we?
- My place. Come on.
Your place? Hey, wait!
Get in the car! Get outta the car!
Go here! Go there!
You think you can just..."your place" any time you feel like it?
Coming?
- Yeah.
Good evening, Sir.
- I'm with him.
Thank you.
Were there any calls?
- None, Sir.
No calls? - None, Sir.
- Are you sure? - Positive, Sir.
If there are any, I am not in.
- Yes, Sir.
And bring us a cold supper.
- Very good, Sir.
What was your name?
Charity. Charity Hope Valentine.
Do you like Brahms?
- Huh?
The music.
Oh, yeah. It's got a...
It's got a great beat.
Leave it!
- It'll get... - Leave it!
Now sit down.
Tell me what you do.
That'd just be a waste of time.
- Why?
'Cause I'd lie.
Why should you lie?
If I told you the truth of what I did, you wouldn't be impressed.
Let me be the judge of that.
What do you do?
I'm a dance hall hostess.
What?
- I'm a dance hall hostess.
You see, you shoulda let me lie.
I was gonna be a dental technician.
Doesn't sound impressive.
- It does to a dance hall hostess.
Champagne?
I don't mind if I do.
- Why did you take a job like that?
I don't know.
Fickle finger of fate, I guess.
- What?
Fickle finger of fate.
You know what that means?
- Yes.
Well, I don't. Not really.
These things always happen to me.
I never know why or how.
People are always coming and asking:
Why that guy, why this job.
I always felt so dumb, saying "I don't know".
But it was the truth, I don't.
I guess you're supposed to know why you do things and wind up places.
Whenever anyone says why or how to me, I just say:
"Fickle finger of fate," and then I don't feel so dumb.
You just like saying it.
You're right.
Fickle finger of fate.
- You see.
Fickle finger of fate.
You wanna try?
It feels good.
It cools the mouth.
Oh, try just once.
Say it. Just once.
All right.
"Fickle finger of fate."
That's nice. It does cool the mouth.
I got lots of phrases I like.
Like if some wisenheimer says something dirty to me, and I can't answer,
I like to say "Up yours!"
You do?
Oh yeah, that really works.
But I wouldn't say it to you.
But I can say "Fickle finger of fate."
- You certainly can.
You have a nice laugh.
You have a nice everything.
- What shall we drink to?
I know.
To the "Fickle finger of fate."
Bottoms up!
- Up yours!
It just slipped out!
You're marvelous, really marvelous.
I am?
That is really something, coming from the Vittorio Vitale.
What makes you think the Vittorio Vitale is special?
Haven't you seen your movies?
- I have better taste than that.
Remember the one you did with that Italian actress Mica Monicali?
Monica Monicelli.
- Yeah.
"Passion in Palermo," I think it was.
There was a scene, she was crying... and you bent down and kissed every one of her fingers...
Her pinky to her thumb, remember?
Unfortunately, no.
- I remember. I'll never forget it.
And then you said:
"Without love, life has no purpose."
The things I say for money.
Did that ever hit home.
Did you hit me where I live!
I went through six marshmallow bars just to hear that one line.
"Without love, life has no purpose."
Is that what you believe?
Sure. Doesn't everybody?
No, not everybody.
Why do you believe in love?
- Everybody needs some religion.
So your religion is love?
I tell you one thing:
I sure go to church a lot.
I see you sitting here, but I find it hard to believe you really exist.
Yes? No, thank you, Manfred.
I'll take care of it myself. Good night.
Our supper.
May I fix you a plate?
What's the matter?
- They'll never believe it.
What? - That I'm here, in Vittorio Vitale's bedroom, drinking champagne, and he's serving me dinner.
Who won't believe it?
- My girlfriends.
What can we do about it?
Do you think...
- What?
That...
- Yes?
Could I have a personally autographed picture?
You can have me in profile or full face, with moustache, clean-shaven, smiling or sexy. - I'll take clean-shaven, full-faced and sexy.
For...
- Charity.
For Charity...
- Who was with me tonight, in my apartment, alone.
I swear it.
Vittorio...
- Yes, yes. I know the rest.
Eccola.
You even write great.
What a night for me!
Tomorrow you move into my locker.
And every time I open the door: Pow!
They're not gonna believe this.
They're gonna think it's a forgery.
Where are you going?
- Wait for me.
I'll be right back.
Don't go away! - Hurricane Hazel could strike. I'm not moving.
If they could see me now
That little gang of mine
Eating fancy chow, drinking fancy wine
I'd like those stumblebums to see
The kind of first-rate chums
I attract. All I can say is "Wow"
Will you look at where I am
Tonight I landed in a pot of jam
If my friends could see me now
They'd never believe it!
They'd never believe it...
Do you think this will do?
I used it in my first film.
Oh, what a beautiful... black thing.
It's a hat.
Eccola.
You see, my initials.
It is yours.
Now wait, there is more.
If they could see me now
My little dusty group
In this million-dollar chicken coop
I'd hear those thriftshop cats say
"Brother, get her!"
Draped on a bedspread made from fur
All I can say is "Wow!"
Wait till the riff and raff
See his autograph
What a build-up, holy cow!
They'd never believe it
If my friends could see me now!
Hi.
- Ciao.
Boy, this is some terrific mattress!
My initials.
Also for you.
- I couldn't. - You must.
I really, I can't.
- I insist. - I'll take it.
I'll go see if there's anything else.
Charlie Drew, baby!
If they could see me now
Alone with Mr. V
Waiting on me like a Maitre 'd.
I hear my buddies saying
"Crazy, what gives!
She's living like the other half."
To think the highest brow
Should pick the lowest brow
What a step-up, holy cow!
They'd never believe it
If my friends could see me now
They'd never believe it!
They'd never believe it!
If my friends could see me...
Hey girls, look it's me, Charity!
Boy, this is some terrific floor.
Miss Charity Hope Valentine.
Since I could find nothing else in all of my possessions that could express my warm feelings for what you have done tonight, for what you have given me,
I ask you please to accept this.
Wow, I accept.
May I just say that I've never received a gift in such a gorgeous package?
Mister Vitale, you've been so terrific to me.
I think this is the best time
I ever spent in my whole life.
No, no please.
Suppose you eat your supper?
Pronto.
Tell her I'm asleep.
No, tell her I'm dead.
Tell her...
What?
Accidenti!
Lock the door! Lock the door!
It's Ursula.
She's here. What should I do?
What should I do?
If you want my opinion, we don't really need her.
And in my opinion, we don't really need her.
Vittorio, I know you're in there.
Let me in!
Ursula, go away.
Vittorio, please!
- No!
Please!
- No!
Please!
I can't stand it! Let her in!
Yes, you're right.
In here.
I'll get rid of her as soon as I can.
In a second!
Let me in. Don't treat me this way.
I almost forgot.
If you get the chance,
I'd love a cold beer.
Vittorio, I'm not leaving until you open this door!
Vittorio, what took you so long?
What's going on?
Is that why you came back, to accuse me again?
You have someone else in here.
- Very well.
I picked up a girl off the street, and she's hiding in the closet.
I don't believe you.
- Look for yourself.
All right, I will.
What's the matter with me?
You wouldn't stoop so low as to hide a woman in the closet.
I don't know what comes over me.
The thought of you with another woman drives me insane.
Why do I torture myself this way?
Why? Why?
If you really cared,
I'd give you anything.
I care.
Of course I care, but can't we discuss this in the morning?
Vittorio, do you really care?
- Of course I care.
Of course I care.
- Really? - Really.
Ursula, I don't understand why we torture each other this way.
Because I'm a jealous fool.
How could I believe you'd bring home some cheap little nothing?
Without you, there is no love!
Without love... life has no purpose.
Ursula, Ursula.
Vittorio, Vittorio.
Talk about your foreign movies!
If my friends... could... see me... now.
It's morning.
- Good morning.
Good morning. Are you all right?
It's too soon to tell.
Silk sheets!
Must have cost a fortune!
Thank you for everything.
I'm sorry the way things turned out.
I sort of figured, you know.
- Why do you say that?
Because you're you, and I'm me.
For the taxi.
- You've given me enough already.
Ciao.
- Ciao.
First, we go to this ritzy place and end up dancing.
He is some terrific dancer!
Then we go to his fashionable East Side apartment.
Except it was a whole house, with so many rooms, you needed a compass.
Then we sat around sipping champagne and talking about life and things.
Boy, it was some terrific night!
Come six o'clock, guess what he wants to do then?
Send me home in his own private limousine.
I say to him, "Honey, forget it.
I enjoy walking at sunrise."
But I didn't actually walk. I flew!
My feet never touched the ground.
Well, you keep on smoking them funny little cigarettes!
I knew you wouldn't believe it.
You swear on your mother's life?
- On my mother's life.
Wanda, call up and see how her mother is.
All right! Look!
Look... what he gave me.
And look what else:
His cane and his hat.
Momentoes of our evening together.
Is that all he gave you?
- What d'you mean?
Hi team. - Did you hear about
Charity's night with Vittorio Vitale?
I don't believe it!
- All she got was an old hat and a cane!
- I believe it.
If I was you, I'd pass this hat and beat myself to death with the cane,
'cause you are dumb!
You don't know what happened.
- What you do in bed's your business.
I wasn't even in bed.
I was in the closet!
To each his own.
The least you coulda got was a mink coat. - What for?
No details, no results!
A hat and a cane? I'd of walked out with my own beauty parlor!
You'll never get outta here.
- It was your big chance, baby.
Now you're stuck like all of us.
It ain't no use flapping your wings,
'cause we are caught in the flypaper.
Not me!
What d'you say?
- I said, "Not me."
What chance have we got in a miserable joint like this?
I mean, just look at us!
- I was always like this!
What's the matter with it?
- Nothing, if you like beat-up broads nobody cares about. Well, not me.
I'm not gonna spend the next
40 years in the Fandango Ballroom.
I'm not gonna become the first gray-haired taxi dancer.
I am getting out.
Out! What a nice word.
Gotta be something better than this
There must be something better to do
When I find something better to do
I'm gonna get up, get out and do it!
There must be some respectable trade
There must be something easy to learn
When I find me something I can learn
I'm gonna get up and learn it!
All these jokers, how I hate them
With their groping, grabbing, clutching, clinching, strangling, handling...
Gotta be some life cleaner than this
Gotta be some good reason to live
When I find a kind of life I can live
I'm gonna get up, get out and live it!
I got it!
- What?
I'm gonna be... a receptionist!
In one of those glass skyscrapers!
My own typewriter, and watercoolers, and office parties.
And coffee-breaks!
Sitting at my desk on the 41st floor
In my copy of a copy of a copy of Dior
I'll receive big tycoons
And I'll point to a chair
I'll say "Honey, while you're waiting
How would you like to put it down over there!"
Gotta be something better than this...
Hey, me too!
I'm gonna get out and go right to the top! - Yes!
I'm gonna be a hat-check girl at one of them
East Side high-class restaurants.
Cigarettes costing 60 cents,
"Keep the change."
And all those hats coming in:
Derbies, homburgs... and that cute little checkered number with the skinny brim and the feather!
Check your hat, Sir? Your coat?
Your vest? Check your pants?
Check your socks, Sir? Your shoes?
I can hold them while you dance
Check your eyes, Sir? Your ears?
Check and see if you are free
How about it after hours?
I'll check you
And you check me!
I'm gonna get out too!
- Baby, what can you do?
I don't know. Just get me outta here and I'll figure it out later.
Gotta be some life cleaner than this
Gotta be some good reason to live
When I find some kinda life I can live
I'm gonna get out and live it!
And when I find me some kind of life I can live
I'm gonna get up
I'm gonna get out
I'm gonna get up, get out
And live...
Live it!
Excuse me, ladies!
They just announced the sweepstakes winners.
Since none of you is a winner, get your keisters back inside.
In the first place, watch your language. There's ladies present.
In the second place, we're not sure we're coming back.
I can always find somebody else.
- That's the third place. I'm coming.
Nickie, what about all those plans?
Yeah? What about 'em?
I've got it, Mr. Carmichael.
Stenotypist, with 9 paid holidays, cost of living escalation and free maternity care.
Okay, Mr. Carmichael. First stenotypist that walks in you got.
Goodbye, Mr. Carmichael.
Come in. Sit down.
Card?
Well now, Miss Valentine.
What can we do for you?
I want a job. A nice job.
- Of course you do. What nice job?
And don't say mine, because it's already taken.
Well, something in an office.
- Good!
You type, of course?
- No.
Take shorthand?
- No.
Operate calculators?
- No.
Keep books?
- No.
File?
- No.
Run a switchboard?
- No.
Speak a foreign language?
- No.
Um...
- No.
Ask me some more questions.
Look Miss...
Valentine.
- How about...
A stenotypist?
- Are you a stenotypist?
Not at the moment.
- But you do stenotype?
Maybe.
- What do you mean?
What is it?
Where did you go to school?
Public Elementary School Number 84.
I mean after that.
- After what?
This isn't going too good.
Have you had any formal training in any field whatsoever?
Nothing that comes to mind.
What do you expect me to do?
I told you, find me a nice job!
- But you can't do anything!
But I must be able to do somethin'!
I mean, everybody knows how to do somethin'! Don't they?
I used to think so.
Look, Miss, uh...
Valentine. Please Mr. Nicholsby, you gotta find me something.
I don't wanna go back.
I want a nice job, where I can meet some nice people.
I want very much to change my life.
I'll work hard, awful hard.
And I'll learn quick.
Find me something, please!
Oh! Is this a gag?
I'm right, aren't I? It is a gag!
Those guys put you up to it.
Like the time they sent over a guy who stuttered for a radio announcer.
They should know, I can spot 'em!
You can tell them, you really had me going.
It took you out, didn't it?
You're a very good sport,
Mr. Nicholsby.
You're pretty good yourself.
I gotta be going now.
I have a job, you know.
I got a swell job.
I was just helping them out.
That stuff about Public Elementary
School Number 84 was perfect!
Yeah, it was good.
Miss?
Are you going down, Miss?
Miss, I'm going to be late.
I didn't mean to rush you.
I hope I wasn't rude.
If I'm late, they'll blow a fuse.
What was that?
- We stopped.
I'd have to say that.
Blowing a fuse. How dumb!
Press the button over there, it'll get started again.
We're stuck.
- Yeah.
Oh boy.
Kinda stuffy in here.
Isn't it kinda stuffy?
Maximum weight in pounds... 3500.
What do you weigh?
- Then we're all right.
Of course we are.
- Yeah, we're fine.
We're just stuck in a little old elevator.
Hey, are you okay really?
- Who, me? - Yeah.
Oh yes. I'm fine.
I have to get used to it, that's all.
This is the first time
I've been trapped in an elevator.
Trapped, trapped, trapped.
Hey, do you have that thing, where you're scared of small places?
Claustrophobia?
- Yeah! - No. Nothing like that.
Claustrophobia? No, no...
No, I just can't stand small, tight places.
But I can handle this, because I know we'll get out of here.
I'm sure we will.
- You really think so?
Of course.
- But if you thought we were trapped?
But we're not trapped.
- But if we were, what would you say?
I'd say, "We're really trapped."
I knew it!
- You shouldn't get so excited!
Yeah.
Isn't this awful? I never act this way.
I'm a very calm, organized person.
If it really comes down to it, you can depend on me.
You understand that?
- I understand.
I hope it doesn't come down to it.
Maybe I should yell for help.
- Why not?
Help.
Help.
Help!
My name is Charity Hope Valentine.
Hey, you're shaking!
- All over.
Here, give me your wrist.
- You know what I feel like doing?
Taking off all my clothes.
I don't think that'd do much good.
You'd think they'd have a telephone!
Never go in an elevator without checking for a phone!
Hey!
- Listen! What do you think of this?
Climbing out of the elevator, shimmying up the cable, and then forcing the door open on the floor above.
It might work, but I do think it sounds dangerous.
Then don't try it.
Stay here with me.
Come on, down there!
We don't think it's funny anymore!
If I could just get out for a few minutes...
Just a few minutes outside, and then I'd be all right.
Then I'd come back inside.
The best thing is to keep talking, then you won't think about it.
What's your name?
Don't you have a name?
- I don't think so.
Sure. Everybody's got a name.
Bruce, Howard, Richard...
Oscar. My name is Oscar Lindquist.
Oscar Lindquist?
No, let's keep our clothes on, Oscar.
Where do you live?
- Who?
Oscar Lindquist.
Where do you live? Keep talking!
In an elevator!
- You don't! You live in a house!
Now concentrate!
- 411 East 74th Street.
I'm gonna use up all the air.
Keep talking, Oscar!
- You should breathe some of the air.
I can breathe. Where do you work?
Excelsior Life Insurance Company.
I'm an actuary.
What's an actuary?
- I figure out probabilities.
Good. What's a probability?
- The odds.
The odds on what?
- Suppose you wanted a policy.
I want a policy. Go on!
- It's my job to study your situation, and figure out the odds on your meeting with an accident, like suff...
...suffocating in an elevator.
- Oscar! Mr. Lindquist!
Are you all right?
This is really my lucky day.
Of all the guys in town, I wind up with a candidate for the funny farm.
Not too bad-looking, though...
For a fruit-cake.
It's a nice face, as faces go
It's a very nice face
With a place for every feature
Every feature in its place
Not a commonplace face
His eyes...
Blue!
His chin: Stubborn and strong
His ears...
They're ordinary ears
His nose...
A little long
Still...
It's a gentle face
A little square, a little corny
It's a sentimental face
If he'd smile
He'd look like... so!
When he's mad
He'd look like... so!
So...!
Don't make this a federal case
It's just another pretty face
But you know
It's a very, very, very nice face...
Where am I?
- You remember where you were? - No.
Well, you're still there.
- Don't leave me!
I won't leave you. I promise
I'll stay, and everything'll be fine.
What happened?
- I think the lights went out.
Oh boy!
Help!
- Help!
Help.
- Help.
Oscar, the lights are on!
Push the button!
It's moving!
Of course, your big problem is panic.
78% of common household accidents could be avoided by calm, clear-headed thinking...
Well...
See ya round.
Yeah.
Miss! Miss, do you suppose...
Well, you know, you think...
I don't suppose we could...
You're trying to ask me something, but ya gotta give me a hint.
Can I see you this Sunday?
Aren't you late for work?
- I was going to group analysis, but I guess I missed it.
- You gonna be all right?
Oh yes. It was my last session this week. I'm finished.
Good. What was your problem?
One of my problems was that I was painfully shy.
And now you're cured?
No, I never had the nerve to bring it up, so I quit.
I guess you're busy Sunday?
Can I ask you a personal question?
You're not affiliated?
Like a wife?
- Oh no! Nothing like that.
Are you busy Sunday?
- No.
Where d'you live?
You prefer to meet me somewhere?
That little bridge in Central Park?
Maybe we better forget the whole thing.
Please. Two o'clock Sunday?
If you're not there,
I'll understand. I'll be there anyway.
I've got nothing else to do.
I must be out of my head.
What am I doing here?
Charity!
I'm glad you could make it.
I thought, after what happened in the elevator, you might think...
I was some kind of a nut.
Oh! I almost forgot. Here!
I grow them myself, in my apartment.
Do you mind if we get off the bridge?
- Sure. I've made all kinds of plans...
Here it comes:
"I left my wallet in my other pants."
Forget it, Charlie, you ain't gettin' a nickel out of me.
Do you like modern art? I have several fine reproductions at home.
Do you know where I'd like to take you? - Yeah, to your place...
To look at your reproductions.
Boy! If Nickie and Helene could see me now.
Who are Nickie and Helene?
- Two of the girls I work with.
You know, I've been so busy talking.
Where do you work?
No, wait!
Let me guess. I can look at a person and tell what they do.
Now, I'd say you definitely work...
...in a bank.
Am I right?
You got it! - It's kind of a sixth sense. Which bank?
You familiar with Brooklyn?
- No.
It's in Brooklyn.
You want a stick of gum?
No thanks.
Working in a bank can be very dangerous.
In the New York area, the odds are 1 in 75 you'll be held up in 12 months.
Just livin' is dangerous, right?
May I see you home? Where d'you live?
It's way far out. And it's late. You gotta get up early.
I'll be okay. Honest.
Listen, may I see you tomorrow?
Maybe we could go to a movie?
Okay, but one with a happy ending.
I'm nuts about happy endings.
Good! I'll pick you up at 5 o'clock in front of the bank.
...suppose we meet at the bridge?
Night.
- Good night.
I want you to know
I had a very nice time... being with you.
- So did I, Oscar.
A very nice time.
- I had a very nice time too.
Well...
- Well...
You're a lovely girl, Charity.
Sweet Charity.
Gee, for a weirdo, he's very nice!
I just live around the corner.
Sweet Charity.
Sweet Charity!
Sweet Charity.
Nickie, Helene! Guess what happened?
Somethin' every girl dreams about.
You've been drafted?
- No, I met a man.
A nice man.
- Here it is. The 11 o'clock news.
I spent the whole afternoon with him, and he never tried any funny business.
All he did was kiss my hand.
That's not making a pass, is it?
Naw! Is it Helene?
- What?
If a guy kisses your hand, would you classify that as a pass?
Depends.
- On what?
On where your hand is.
Where was your hand?
On the end of my arm!
So besides slobbering all over your knuckles, what else does he do?
He's a reactionary.
- A what?
He figures out odds.
- A horseplayer.
No, for an insurance company.
And he also grows flowers.
A goofball!
- He's not a goofball!
What does the goofball think of your profession? - Have you told him you're in the rent-a-body business?
He doesn't think anything of it.
She ain't told him!
- First, he's very highly educated, and a thing like that wouldn't bother him.
Second, he knows, because I told him.
You told him?
- Yeah. - You really told him?
Yes. I told him!
- When?
Tomorrow!
You like peanuts?
- Yeah. - For our anniversary.
It's 2 weeks since we were trapped between the 9th and 10th floor.
What a two weeks this has been!
We've been to 6 movies, 4 museums, a lecture and a pet show.
- I'd like to do something different.
You wanna rob a supermarket?
- Do you like to go to church?
To church?
It's the Rhythm of Life Tabernacle.
It started out as a jazz group in
San Franciso and became a religion.
Hey baby, let there be light!
Lights!
And so there was light!
And the title of the sermon will be:
"We have beat our swords into plowshares, and the beat goes on."
Daddy started out in San Francisco
Tooting on his trumpet loud and mean
A voice said "Go forth Daddy!
Spread a picture on a wider screen!"
There's a million pigeons waiting to be hooked on new religions
Hit the road, leave your wife
Spread the "Rhythm of Life"
The Rhythm is a powerful beat
Puts a tingle in your fingers and feet
Rhythm in your bedroom and the street
The Rhythm is a powerful beat!
Daddy go!
Go, go, go!
Tell them everything you know
Daddy spread the gospel in Milwaukee
Took his walkie-talkie to Rocky Ridge
Blew his way to Canton then Scranton
Till he landed under Manhattan Bridge
Daddy was a new sensation
Got a congregation
Built up an operation down below
With the Piper blowing, the muscatel flowing, all the cats were go-going
Flip your wings and fly to Daddy...
Fly, fly, fly to Daddy
Take a dive and swim to Daddy...
Swim to Daddy
Hit the floor and crawl to Daddy...
Crawl, crawl, crawl to Daddy
Flip your wings. Fly!
Flip! Fly!
Take a dive! Swim!
Swim!
To Daddy!
Hit the floor! Crawl to Daddy!
The Rhythm of Life is a powerful beat
Puts a tingle in your fingers and feet
Rhythm in the bedroom, rhythm in the street. It's a powerful beat
To feel the Rhythm of Life
To feel the powerful beat
To feel the tingle in your fingers
To feel the tingle in your feet...
Flip your wings and fly to Daddy
Take a dive and swim to Daddy
Hit the floor and crawl to Daddy
Let me hear it! Sock it to me!
Let it all hang out!
Gather round!
This is where it's all happening.
The "Rhythm of Life", number 7 in the top ten religions.
But we're gonna climb to number 1!
- I'm hip, baby!
But dig: Time is running out on that big LP called life.
And the greatest disc jockey of all is gonna come and take us to the flipside of life, called eternity.
Eternity!
- That big coffee break in the sky!
But before we groove that final date, before we head for that last 8 bars, we gotta make our peace.
Make it, Daddy.
I'm gonna make it!
I want you cats to listen to everything I'm gonna lay on you.
Number one:
Thou shall dig thy neighbor as thou wouldst have him dig thee...
Number 2: Thou shall not put down thy mamas and papas.
Number 3: Thou shall not swing with another cat's chick.
Number four: Thou shall not blow thy minds on school nights.
What a devout group!
Where did ya find them?
Oh, I'm on a mailing list.
It's the Church of the Month Club.
And last, come here! But not least:
Thou shall not indulge in the evil marijuana weed, known as pot, grass, maryjane,
Acapulco Gold...
As it is sinful, it is harmful and very expensive.
So I suggest, if anybody's holding, drop it before the fuzz arrives.
Love!
Love, Daddy!
Yeah!
Are they gone?
You're shaking.
- I'm scared to death!
Don't... don't worry.
I'm right here beside you.
Relax and be scared all you want.
Thank you, I will.
You know something?
I don't mind being scared with you.
When you've got somebody you can depend on, that'll take care of you, then you can afford to be scared.
I've never had anybody like that.
I've never had anybody depend on me.
I think they're gone.
- You know what I wish?
I wish we could stay like this forever. - Do you, Oscar?
You're the first girl
I ever met that I ever trusted, and believed in.
My whole right side's going to sleep.
- You're all scrunched up.
How's that?
Oh, Oscar...
I'm going to tell you something
I don't think you'll like.
There couldn't be anything.
Remember I told you
I worked in a bank?
A bank in Brooklyn?
What about that bank in Brooklyn?
We just raised our interest rates.
Hey!
- What's the matter?
Did you hear what I said?
I said I wish we could stay in here forever.
Look where we are!
In a small, tight place
I'm usually scared to be in!
But I like it!
I don't have claustrophobia any more.
I'm cured!
You cured me!
- I did! How?
I don't know, but it's gone!
For the first time in my life, it's gone!
A man with no dream and no plan
One lonely night
I found Sweet Charity
You make life fun for me
Oh, what it's done for me
Sweet Charity!
Warm words I've never said lately
Pop off the top of my head
It's incredible!
Suddenly I'm the guy
I never dared to be
Watch me touch the sky quite easily!
So if you are free, Sweet Charity
Please belong to me...
Please...
I'd just about given up ever finding anybody like you.
The world's gone crazy.
Everything's all mixed up.
The old standards of decency and morality don't mean anything anymore.
I see the way the girls at the office are passed around, and the jokes they tell about them...
I get sick, Charity.
Most people would laugh.
I'm not laughing, Oscar.
- I knew you were different.
I just knew, like the way
I knew you worked in a bank.
Oscar, there's something...
- You believed in the things I did.
Things like...
Innocence and...
Try purity.
Does that sound... corny?
- No.
Well, yeah. Maybe it is.
But that's the way I always pictured it. The way it had to be.
No one else seems to think those things are important anymore.
That's why you're a very special person, Charity.
Charity?
Charity!
Do you wanna have...
Fun?
- Come here Cowboy, I wanna tell you...
How's about a few laughs?
I can show you a good time.
What's the big idea?
Miss Valentine! Your escort has shelled out 6.50 to dance with you.
I do not see you dancing.
- Dancing? It's self-defence.
Miss Valentine!
- Herman, I don't like it anymore.
So I'm giving you my 2 weeks notice, as of 2 weeks ago.
This is not a nice place!
Charity?
Hey, Charity, listen!
Hey, baby...
Charity?
- I'm up here.
Boy, am I sick and tired of that musical snake pit.
What's so bad about it?
You dance a little, talk a little.
Swivel your hips a little.
Just like that, you can kill a lifetime.
How's things going with the goofball?
Who?
- The hand-kisser.
Him? Who needs him?
I don't need anybody, and if I needed anybody, not him.
- She's nuts about him.
It's no good.
He thinks I work in a bank.
So let him.
He trusts me. He believes in me.
I gotta tell him the truth.
Tell him who I am, what I do.
That much truth ain't good.
- I shoulda told him before, but...
He's just the nicest thing that ever happened to me.
I wanted it to last.
You're gonna tell him you lied to him?
You're gonna tell him you've been working in this dump? - Yup.
You're gonna tell him about
Frank and Charlie and...? - Yeah.
Charity, I gotta hand it to you, you are an extremely honest, open and stupid broad.
Yup.
Charity, what...?
Sit down, Oscar.
Aren't you going to sit with me?
I have some important things to say.
If I have to look in your eyes,
I'll never be able to say them.
You alone, Miss?
- She's with me.
I was asleep when you called,
I'm still in my pyjamas.
Don't look at me!
Oscar,
I don't now, I never have... and probably never ever will work in a bank.
I don't even have a bank account.
What money I do have,
I keep in an empty jar of coffee.
You know how I earn money? - You're a dance hall hostess. ...hostess.
I work in a cheap dance hall, and I dance with strange men.
I drink with them, and sometimes... sometimes...
How did you know?
When you left me in the phone booth,
I ran outside.
I saw someone,
I thought it was you.
She went into that place, and then I knew it wasn't you.
Except I saw the photographs, and it was you.
I didn't go in. I couldn't.
I went home.
I tried to hate you.
I tried very hard.
But I couldn't.
I just couldn't hate you.
Maybe you'll have better luck when I tell you the rest of it.
Not important.
Not important?
Whaddya mean?
What about all those things you said?
But, Charity...
- Don't look at me!
Charity, I know what I said.
But I just can't let you get away.
You have to marry me.
I've gotta tell you everything.
- I don't care what you've done.
If you only knew...
All those guys... All those guys...
Charity, don't cry.
Please don't cry. I believe you.
I know. I'm crying about that other part. - What other part?
The marrying part.
I didn't hear it the first time.
Will you marry...?
- Careful!
...marry me?
- Oscar!
You're not just making fun of me, are you?
Asking a girl to marry her is one of her most sensitive areas.
You shouldn't if you don't mean it.
You can seriously hurt a person, kiddin' around like that.
To tell you the truth, I don't think
I could stand another injury.
For the first time, I'm happy.
I mean really happy inside.
It's all because of you.
Don't look at me!
I can get pretty emotional too.
Give me your hand.
We're gonna get out of the city.
- Ooh, I'd like that!
We'll move to the country.
New Jersey, maybe.
We'll open a nursery, a greenhouse. Grow flowers...
You'd like that. - The thing is to forget the past. - I forgot it.
It's not important.
- It isn't.
We won't discuss it anymore.
We won't even think about it.
A lot of men couldn't do that.
I swear I'll never mention it again, as long as I live.
I'd like that.
- Because...
...I need you, Charity.
I need you, and I love you.
It's about time I got married.
I'm 34 years old.
And you know the odds are 700 and...
Someone loves me!
Someone loves me!
Somebody loves me!
My heart is beating so fast
Music is pouring out of me
Somebody loves me at last
Now...
I'm a brass band, I'm a harpsichord
I'm a clarinet
I'm the Philadelphia Orchestra
I'm the Modern Jazz Quartet
I'm the band from
Macy's big parade
A wild Count Basie blast
I'm the bells of St. Peter's in Rome
I'm tissue paper on a comb
Music is pouring out of me
'Cause somebody loves me at last!
Somebody loves me!
She's a brass band, a harpsichord
She's a clarinet
She's the Philadelphia Orchestra
The Modern Jazz Quartet
She's a brass band, a harpsichord
She's a clarinet
That's me!
She's the Philadelphia Orchestra
She's the Modern Jazz Quartet
She's the band from Macy's big parade
A wild Count Basie blast
The bells of St. Peter's in Rome
She's tissue paper on a comb
Somebody loves me...
...at last!
You don't have to come in.
- No, it's all right.
I'll just be a few minutes.
- I'm fine, just fine.
Hey! Anybody in there?
Oh, it's you.
- What's going on?
Ah, business stinks.
I sent everybody home.
But I called
Nickie and Helene and told them...
You heard the news?
I'm tying the knot, gettin' hitched.
Yeah, I heard.
- This is him. This is the one.
Oscar Lindquist, this is Herman.
Affectionately known as "Der Führer".
How do you do?
- Well, I got some work to do.
I gotta get things out of my locker.
- But don't take none of the hangers.
Girls always take the hangers.
He's kinda gruff on the outside, but inside he's a very rotten person.
Would ya turn on a light?
- You should know the way by now.
Eight years of your life, and nobody cares to turn on a light...
Surprise!
We nearly fooled ya! - You thought you'd get away without a party?
You shouldn't have!
- I told you we shouldn't have.
Everybody!
That's him. That's the one!
Mister Oscar Lindquist.
- Hi, Oscar!
These are Nickie and Helene.
All right folks!
The hostesses at the Fandango, the waiters, Jeff the Bouncer,
Erwin the Cop... and our 3 regulars since 1949... present... a 17-dollar cake!
"Happy Birthday Angelo"?
- You couldn't get a new cake?
That's all they had on short notice.
It's the sentiment that counts.
I and Oscar and Angelo thank you.
For a broad, she's got a lot of class!
Somebody get Mr. Whatsis a beer.
Charity Hope Valentine, we who've lived with you, undressed with you, suffered the indignities of this crumby joint with you...
We who have come to know and love you, on your nuptial eve...
Come on!
- Will you shut up!
We just wanna wish... I'm gonna cry!
Quit slobbering all over the cake!
Get down, let me do it!
Charity, honey, we just wanted to...
I'm gonna miss you, girl!
I'll give it to her.
I'm the one that picked it out.
Charity, please accept this gift as a token of our estimation!
I hope it's a nice gift.
What kind of wedding present is that?
I thought she was pregnant.
Isn't that why she's getting married?
It's the nicest wedding present
I ever got!
Folks! It ain't often that one of our group marries a respectable guy.
This is the first time.
So, in honor of our own blushing bride-to-be, I would like to say...
Wait!
Jeez! It's tough for a loud-mouthed mug like me
Who all the time bellows like a bull
To make the words about the Mrs-to-be
When what you think is an empty heart is full
Tomorrow when you say "I do"
I'll die
I'm almost too ashamed
To tell you why
I love to cry at weddings
I walk into a chapel
And get happily hysterical
The ushers and attendants
The family dependents
I see them and I start to sniff
As the bride and groom look nervous
Tears of joy stream down my face
I love to cry at weddings
Anybody's wedding
Any time, anywhere, any place!
I always weep at weddings
What's as sweet and sloppy as a "Promise me..."?
The man you share your bed with
Is married to you so you know...
- He won't jump up and blow
I could marry Herman
- And be permanently sorry
We would make a lousy pair
But gee, I want a wedding
Any kind of wedding
Any time, any place, anywhere...
The bride and groom look nervous...
I drink champagne and sing Sweet Adelaine
I love to cry at weddings
Anybody's wedding
Just as long as it's not mine!
Everybody, the food is on me!
Hey, Johnny!
- Lindquist. Oscar Lindquist.
Just make sure you treat her right.
- Yes, of course.
'Cause she's entitled.
If I was to list all the rotten deals that sweet dame's been dealt...
If I was to tell you...
- There's no need.
Oh yeah! You know all about it.
I was against telling you anything.
She tells you everything, and you say it doesn't matter, right?
That's right.
Say it again.
She hasn't been making a pitch, has she? He's taken!
Hold these. I'll be right back.
Well...
- Well...
Well...
It can happen, you see.
Just keep hoping, that's the important thing.
Miracles do happen.
Everybody, so long!
I love to cry at weddings
Anybody's wedding
Any time, any place, anywhere...
Didn't you see the sign?
"Please do not throw rice in the halls or on the stairs."
That's because
1 out of every 42 accidents occurs in a public building.
- I'll be careful.
Look.
You like it?
It's... it's...
It's...
It caught my eye, you and your flowers and everything.
You don't like it.
- I do, I do. It's very... flowery.
Boy, there sure are a lot of questions.
"Name:"
Charity Hope Valentine.
Soon to be Mrs. Oscar Lindquist.
"Age:"
What the hell! Heck!
"Place of birth:" New York.
New York. New York.
"Identifying marks:"
What are they?
You know... scars, birthmarks...
...tattoos...
A tattoo.
I'm gonna have it taken off, Oscar.
"Occupation:" Unemployed!
It hurts like crazy, but you can have 'em taken off.
Charity.
Okay, finished.
Your turn.
Boy, I didn't care too much for the first half of my life, but the second half is getting good.
Charity, I can't go through with it.
I can't marry you.
You're nervous, aren't ya?
Perfectly natural to be nervous.
I can't do it.
Is this a joke?
Is this a joke, Oscar?
If it is, it's a very rotten joke.
This isn't a joke. Nobody would joke about a thing like this.
Is it a joke?
I know what it is.
It's the stupid dress!
Me and my crumby taste.
Why don't we go and get me another?
It's not the dress.
- It's not the dress?
So it's the way I talk, isn't it?
I know I say those dumb things, but if I went to night school...
- Charity, it's not you. It's me.
What are you trying to tell me?
I don't know how to explain it.
Well, try! Holy mackerel, please try!
I have this thing, this mental block.
What? There's a lot of that around.
- It's a stupid, childish, insane fixation.
It's wrong. I know it's not what a person's done, it's what's inside.
But I can't help it.
I know it's wrong, and I can't help it.
I got an idea:
Let's you and me get married, then we'll talk about your fixation.
It won't do any good.
It's all those other men.
The other men.
No, Oscar, you said that didn't matter.
I thought if I said it enough,
I could convince myself, but it does.
You're just making a mountain out of a couple of guys... - How many?
I wanna know exactly.
Oscar, don't talk like that, because I can't think.
How many?
How far back do you want me to go?
God, I'm a terrible person.
I have no right, asking you things like that.
- Oscar, you can ask me any question.
I won't hide a thing.
- I don't want to know!
Okay, then you get nothing out of me.
I'm very flexible.
I can go either way.
You're better off without me.
I'm doing you a favor. - Oscar!
Oscar! We could be so happy together!
Growing flowers in New Jersey...
On days your mental block bothered you, you could stay in bed.
And I'd grow the flowers.
Oscar.
Oscar, listen:
I could change the way I talk.
I could change the way I dress.
But there's certain things a person can't change, because they're history.
You can't change history, no matter how much you want to. - Charity...
Oscar, I got so much to give.
Please let me give it to you.
Charity, I'm saving you.
I'm saving you from me.
Well, don't save me.
Marry me.
Don't beg, Charity.
You're too good to beg to anyone.
Oscar!
We don't have to get married.
I mean, we could just...
...be together.
Don't you understand?
I would destroy you.
That's okay.
I'm not doing much now anyway.
Oh God.
Forgive me.
Please forgive me.
Where am I going? What will I find?
What's in this grab-bag that I call my mind?
What am I doing alone on the shelf?
Ain't it a shame
No-one's to blame but myself
Which way is clear
When you've lost your way
Year after year
Do I keep falling in love
For just the kick of it
Staggering through the thin and thick
Hating each old and tired trick of it
I'm good and sick of it!
Where am I going?
Why do I care?
Run to the Bronx or Washington Square
No matter where I run
I meet myself there
Looking inside me
What do I see?
Anger and hope and doubt!
Where am I going?
Yeah?
Hey, it's the old married lady!
Hi, baby, it's me! How'd it go?
- Nickie...
What are you doing calling?
You must have better things to do!
Nickie, I wanna talk to you.
Hear her, she's all choked up.
I can't tell you how happy we are.
We've been talkin' about it all day.
Tell us about the ceremony.
It must have been beautiful.
- And talk loud. We're all listening!
Yeah, it was beautiful.
Just like in the movies.
Did he give you a nice ring?
- Did he carry you over the threshold?
Oh yeah, he did all those things.
Just like in the movies.
Put the groom on.
We wanna hear his side!
I can't... He can't.
We won't say nothing dirty!
We just wanna say good luck.
Put him on!
Okay, just a second.
Honey?
The girls wanna say good luck.
He says he can't.
He's shaving, you know.
Are you happy, baby?
Are you finally happy?
Yeah. I'm finally happy.
I hope so. Don't talk to us no more.
Any man who's shaving means business.
So long, baby. Thanks for calling.
It meant a lot, you thinking about us.
If the first one's a girl, you can call it Nickie. - Nick, if it's a boy!
Bye!
Bye.
Looking inside me
What do I see?
Anger, hope, doubt! What am I about?
And where am I going?
He dumped me.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning!
Good morning!
Morning.
Love!
Love!
Good morning.
- Good morning.

[Crowd screaming]
Hey, pardon me for askin', but who's that little old man?
- What little old man?
- That little old man.
Oh, that one.
That's my grandfather.
- Your grandfather?
- Yeah.
- That's not your grandfather.
- It is, you know.
But I've seen your grandfather.
He lives in your house.
Oh, that's my other grandfather, but he's my grandfather as well.
How do you reckon that one out?
Well, everyone's entitled to two, aren't they?
And this is my other one.
We know that, but what's he doin' here?
Well, my mother thought the trip would do him good.
- How's that?
- He's nursin' a broken heart.
JOHN:
Ah, poor old thing.
Hey, mister, are you nursin' a broken heart?
He's a nice old man, isn't he?
He's very clean.
- Hello, grandfather.
- Hello.
He can talk then, can he?
Of course he can talk.
He's a human being, isn't he?
Well, if he's your grandfather, who knows? Ha ha ha.
And we're lookin' after him, are we?
- I look after meself.
- That's what I'm afraid of.
He's got you worried, then?
Him, he's a villain, a real mixer... and he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases.
- GEORGE: Get on.
- No, straight up.
Hiya.
- Hello, Shake.
- Hello, Shake.
- You got on all right, then?
- No.
Oh? Well, we're here.
SHAKE: Norm'll be along in a minute with the tickets.
Hey, who's the little old man?
It's Paul's grandfather.
- Oh, aye, but I thought...
- No, that's his other one.
Oh, that's all right, then.
Clean, though, isn't he?
Oh, aye. He's very clean.
- NORM: Mornin', lads.
- Hi, Norm.
Thank God you've all got here.
Look, I've had a marvelous idea.
Just for once, let's all try to behave... like ordinary respectable citizens.
Let's not cause any trouble, pull any strokes... or do anything
I'm gonna be sorry for... especially tomorrow in that television theater, because...
Are you listening to me,
Lennon?
You're a swine.
Isn't he, George?
Yeah, a swine.
Thanks. Hey!
ALL:
Who's that little old man?
- Well, who is he?
- He belongs to Paul.
Oh, well. I'm going down for a cup of coffee.
- Anyone coming?
- We'll follow you down.
I want me coffee.
You can come with Shake and me, if you like.
PAUL: Look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Don't be cheeky. I'll bind him to me with promises.
Very clean, isn't he?
Come out, granddad.
Make up your mind, will you?
Hello. Morning.
All right?
Whoa.
Do you mind if we have it open?
Yes, I do.
Well, there are four of us, and we'd like it open... not if it's all the same to you, that is.
It isn't. I travel on this train regularly... twice a week, so I suppose
I have some rights.
So have we.
[Playing rock and roll]
And we'll have that thing off as well. Thank you.
- [Turns off]
- But...
An elementary knowledge of the Railway Acts... would tell you that I am perfectly within my rights.
Yeah, but we want to hear it.
There's more of us than you.
We're a community, a majority vote.
Up the workers and all that stuff.
Then I suggest you take that damn thing... into the corridor, or some other part of the train... where you obviously belong.
Give us a kiss.
Look, mister, we paid for our seats, too, you know.
I travel on this train regularly, twice a week.
Knock it off, Paul.
You can't win with his sort.
After all, it's his train, isn't it, mister?
And don't take that tone with me, young man.
I fought the war for your sort.
I bet you're sorry you won.
- I shall call the guard.
- Ah, but what?
They don't take kindly to insults, you know.
Let's go have some coffee and leave the kennel to Lassie.
[Door closes]
PAUL: Hey, mister, can we have our ball back?
PAUL: Look, mister! Mister!
Can we have our ball back?
- JOHN: Hey!
- PAUL: Please, mister!
- You want to watch it.
- Well, it's not my fault.
You stick to that story, son.
I can't help it.
I'm just taller than you are.
They always say that.
Well, I've got me eye on ya.
I'm sorry, Norm. I can't help being taller than you.
Well, don't rub it in! I've a good mind to thump you, Shake.
If you're gonna have a barney, can I hold your coat?
- He started it.
- I did not. You did.
Well, what happened?
The old fella said that... could he have these pictures, and Norm said, "No."
And all I said was,
"Well, why not be big about it?"
- And?
- Your grandfather pointed out... that Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
I knew it. He started it.
- PAUL: I should've known.
- NORM: You what?
You two have never had an argument in your life...
and in two minutes flat, he's got you at it.
He's a king mixer.
He hates group unity, so he gets everyone at it.
Well, I suggest you just give him the photos... and have done with it.
Oh, all right, you old devil.
Here you are.
Hey, Pauly, would you ever sign one of them for us?
Ah, come out, Shake.
JOHN: Hey, look at the talent.
Let's give 'em a pull.
- Should I?
- Aye, but don't rush.
None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I don't know.
I thought it just sounded distinguished-like.
JOHN: George Harrison, the scouse of distinction.
Excuse me, madame.
Excuse me, but these young men
I'm sitting with... wondered if two of us could come over and join you.
I'd ask you myself, only I'm shy.
I'm sorry, miss. You mustn't fraternize with me prisoners.
- Prisoners?
- Convict in transit.
Typical old lads, the lot of them.
Get out, ladies!
Get out while you can!
He's been gone a long time.
- Who?
- Paul's grandfather.
Oh, I didn't notice.
Where'd he go?
- Down the, uh...
- Oh, down the, uh...
Yeah, down the, uh...
Oh, well, give him a couple of minutes, then.
Hey, have you seen
Paul's grandfather?
Of course.
He's concealed about me person.
Now, he must've slipped off somewhere.
- Have you lost him?
- Now, don't exaggerate.
You've lost him!
Look, put it this way, Pauly... he's mislaid him.
Honest, you can't trust you with anything, Norm.
If you've lost him,
I'll cripple ya.
- He can't have got far.
- Let's look up the sharp end.
What's the matter with you, then?
It's his grandfather.
I can tell he doesn't like me.
It's 'cause I'm little.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Yeah, I know.
That's why I play the drums.
It's me active compensatory factor.
Goin' in, then?
No, she'll only reject me in the end... and I'll be frustrated.
You never know.
You may be lucky this time.
No, I know the psychological pattern.
It plays havoc with me drum skins.
Excuse me. Have you seen that little old man we were with?
We've broken out... the blessed freedom of it all.
Have you got a nail file?
These handcuffs are killing me.
I was framed! I'm innocent!
I don't want to go!
Sorry for disturbing you, girls.
I bet you can't guess what I was in for.
Should we go in here?
No, it's probably a honeymoon couple... or a company director or something.
Well, I don't care.
I'm gonna broaden my outlook.
Congratulate me, boys.
I'm engaged.
PAUL: Oh, no, you're not.
Not this time.
PAUL: Oh, no, you're not.
Not this time.
And to think me own grandson... would've let them put me behind bars.
Don't dramatize. Let's face it, you're lucky to be here.
If they'd have had their own way... you would have been dropped off already.
Well, you've got to admit you upset a lot of people.
PAUL: At least I can keep my eye on you...
while you're stuck in here.
Shove up.
- Odds or evens?
- Odds.
JOHN: Don't worry, son.
We'll get you the best lawyer green stamps can buy.
PAUL: Oh! It's a laugh a line with Lennon.
Anyway, it's your fault.
- RINGO: Why me?
- Why not you?
JOHN: God, it's depressing in here, isn't it?
Funny. They usually reckon dogs more than people in England.
You'd expect something more palatial.
- Let's do somethin', then.
- Like what?
Hmm.
OK.
[Girls laughing]
GEORGE:
Cor, there's the girls.
RINGO: I'll deal 'em.
JOHN: Aye aye, the Liverpool shuffle.
Two for you, two for me, three for them.
Cheat.
# I...  #
# Should have known better with a girl like you #
# That I would love everything that you do #
# And I do #
# Hey, hey, hey #
# And I do #
# Whoa, whoa, I...  #
# Never realized what a kiss could be #
# This could only happen to me #
# Can't you see, can't you see #
# That when I tell you that I love you #
# Oh #
# You're gonna say you love me, too #
# Oh #
# And when I ask you to be mine #
# You're gonna say you love me, too #
# So, oh, I...  #
# Should have realized a lot of things before #
# If this is love, you gotta give me more #
# Give me more, hey, hey, hey #
# Give me more #
# Whoa, whoa, I...  #

GEORGE:
He's wearin' his lucky rings.
All mine.
JOHN: It won't buy you happiness, my son.
[Screaming]
Hey, don't move, any of you.
They've gone potty out there.
The place is surging with girls.
Please, sir, can I have one to surge me, sir, please, sir?
No, you can't. Now listen.
As soon as I tell you, get out through this door there...
into that big car that's waiting.
[Girls screaming]
[Screaming]
Come on, lads. Come on, then!
[Train whistle blows]
[Screaming]
[Piano playing]
- I don't snore.
- You do, repeatedly.
Do I snore, John?
Yeah, you're a window rattler, son.
That's just your opinion.
Do I snore, Paul?
With a trombone hooter like yours... it would be unnatural if you didn't.
Now, Pauly, don't mock the afflicted.
Oh, come off it.
It's only a joke.
Ah, it may be a joke, but it's his nose.
He can't help havin' a hideous great hooter...
the poor little head tremblin' under the weight of it.
John, Paul, George, come here.
Get at it.
Hello, the income tax have caught up with us at last.
- None for me, then?
- Sorry.
This'll keep you busy.
It's your nose, you know.
Fans are funny that way.
They take a dislike to things.
They'll pick on a nose.
- Ah, you pick on your own.
- Hey, here.
- Are those yours?
- No, they're for Ringo.
Must've cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
He comes from a large family.
Well...
What's Le Cirque Club?
"The management of Le Cirque Club...
"takes pleasure in requesting the company...
"of Mr. Richard Starkey..."
That's you.
"To their gaming rooms...
"chemin de fer, baccarat, and champagne buffet."
- They want me?
- JOHN: You're a big spender.
- Well, you're not goin'.
- Aw.
Quite right.
Invites to gamblin' dens... full of easy money and fast women... chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar.
Disgustin'.
- That's mine.
- Come on, you lot.
- Get your pens out.
- Why?
It's homework time for you load of college puddings.
I want this lot answered tonight.
- Yeah, right.
- I want to go out.
NORM:
Now, I'll brook no denial.
You couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
Oh, chatter on, son.
Chatter on.
A touch of the writer's cramp will soon sort you out.
Come on, Shake.
- Ta ta, then.
- See ya.
[John humming and chuckling]
- Where are you goin', then?
- He told us to stay, didn't he?
- Come, men!
- Right.
[All mumbling]
Couldn't we get a taxi?
PAUL AND RINGO:
No, we couldn't get a taxi.
[Laughing]
- [Knock knock]
- Come in.
- I'll clear up, sir.
- Yeah.

The manager.
[All talking at once]
Now, come on, you lot.
Get on with it.
- We were gonna do 'em, but...
- Aye. Well, now, now, now.
Hey, any of you lot put a man in the cupboard?
- A man?
- Don't be soft.
Well, somebody did.
He's right, you know.
There you go.
Hey, uh...
Hey, what's all this?
PAUL:
Oh, him. He's been lurking.
He looks a right lurker, doesn't he?
You're undressed.
Where are your clothes?
The old gentleman.
He borrowed them to go gambling at Le Cirque.
He's gone to my club, has he?
- Yeah! It's all your fault.
- RINGO: What?
Gettin' invites to gambling clubs and all that.
He's probably in the middle of some orgy by now.
JOHN:
An orgy? Orgy! Ha ha ha!
- But what about me?
- You're too old.
Encore de champagne, monsieur?
Oh, yeah. And I'll have some more champagne, as well.
Lord John McCartney, millionaire Irish peer.
Filthy rich, of course.
Well, I don't know.
He looks quite clean to me.
Come on, you lot. Try to act with a bit of decorum.
This is a posh place.
JOHN: We know how to behave.
We've had lessons.
I'm sorry, sir.
Members and invited guests only.
- Aye. Well, uh...
- Oh, yes.
I'm with them.
I'm Ringo's sister.
Excuse me. Have you got a little old man here?
Do you mean Lord McCartney?
Oh, he's at it again.
Look, I'm his grandfather.
I mean...
WOMAN: Oh, it must be the dolly floor show.
GRANDFATHER:
Put me down!
Who are these ruffians?
I never saw them before.
MANAGER:
Before you go, gentlemen...
there's a little matter of the bill.
I'll take care of that.
A hundred and eighty pounds?
I beg your pardon... guineas.
WAITER:
Your winnings, my lord... £190.
Ha!
- What about me change?
- Cloak room charge.
Ah, well, easy come, easy go.
Well?
Guten morgen, mein herr.
[Speaking German]
[Imitates engine rewing]
Ah, ze filthy Englander.
Guten morgen.
Keep Britain tidy.
- Aw, go on, George.
- Don't be ridiculous.
But you said I could.
Honestly, me mind boggles at the very idea.
A grown man, and you haven't shaved with a safety razor.
It's not my fault. I come from a long line of electricians.
Well, you're not practicing on me.
All right, then. But show us.
Oh, come on, then.
Aah hee hee ho!
Ooh.

# Rule, Britannia,

Deutschland Uber Alles]
Help! Ich! Headphones! Help me!
[Blows bubbles] Help!
Torpedoed again, eh?
Come on, lads.
There's a car waiting to take you to the studio.
- Hey, where's John?
- In the bath.
All right, Lennon, let's have you.
Come on, John.
Stop larking about.
John? John?
John? John?
What are you messing around with that boat for?
There's a car waiting.
Come on.
Ready, John?
As soon as we draw up... open that door and straight in.
[Shrieking]
We can't keep them waiting much longer.
- I knew they'd be late.
- Oh, here they are.
- Boys, come on.
- Where have you been?
It's your press conference we're arranging.
NORM: All right.
Give us a couple of shakes... to get our breath, will you?
JOHN: Hey, I've got a suit just like him, you know.
MAN: Ringo. Yeah.
I don't like the handkerchief.
I always have the handkerchief in me trouser pocket.
You can't blow your nose on it up there, can you, mister?
MAN: No, you can't.
[Crowd chattering]
REPORTER:
How about highbrow music?
GEORGE: I've always liked that question.
JOHN: I never noted his nose till about six months ago.
GEORGE: And me mother asked me before we left for America...
if we wanted any sandwiches.
JOHN: And when I plugged her in, she just blew up.
Tell me... how did you find America?
Turn left at Greenland.
- Has success changed your life?
- Yes.
I'd like to keep Britain tidy.
- Are you a mod or a rocker?
- Um, no, I'm a mocker.
[Laughs] Oh.
Have you any hobbies?
No. Actually, we're just good friends.
Do you think these haircuts have come to stay?
Well, this one has, you know.
It's stuck on good and proper now.
Frightfully nice.
What would you call that hairstyle you're wearing?
Arthur.
No. Actually, we're just good friends.
No, they're brown, aren't they?
What do you call that collar?
- Oh. A collar.
- Oh.
Do you often see your father?
No. Actually, we're just good friends.
How do you like your girlfriends to dress?
Ha ha!
- JOHN: What a drag that was.
- GEORGE: I'm starving.
Didn't even get a jam butty, did you?
Anything left?
We've just finished, Pauly.
Hey, George, give us your John Henry on that picture.
Hey, look at that.
Is that our set down there?
- Shall we go down, have a go?
- RINGO: Yeah.
- Trees and everything.
- A lot of fellas for one set.
Look, it's a bird.
Just passing through, like.
- Where are they?
- On the stage, down here.
[Chattering]
[Hits cymbal]
Leave them drums alone.
MAN: Oh, surely I could just have a little touch.
You so much as breathe heavy on them... and I'm out on strike.
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
There you go, hiding behind a smoke screen... of bourgeois cliches.
I don't go messing about with your earphones, do I?
- Spoilsport.
- Well?
He's very fussy about his drums, you know.
They loom large in his legend.
- What's up?
- Oh, he's sulking again.
JOHN:
Ha ha ha! I'll show him.
# If I fell in love with you #
# Would you promise to be true #
# And help me #
# Understand #
# 'Cause I've been in love before #
# And I found that love was more #
# Than just holding hands #
# If I give my heart #
# To you #
# I must be sure #
# From the very start #
# That you #
# Would love me more than her #
# If I trust in you #
# Oh, please #
# Don't run and hide #
# If I love you, too #
# Oh, please #
# Don't hurt my pride like her #
# 'Cause I couldn't stand the pain #

More... I'd like more drums there.
- No. I think it's on that...
- It sounds like a...
On the third bit.
You know, on the third bit.
Third bit, more bang.
[Plays]
Right. Let's hear no more about it. You're probably right.
Now, look... if you think I'm unsuitable, let's have it out in the open.
I can't stand these backstage politics.
Aren't you tending to black and white the situation somewhat?
Well, quite honestly, I wasn't expecting a musical arranger... to question my ability picture-wise.
I could listen to him for hours.
What's all this about a musical arranger?
Mr. McCartney Senior.
Hey, Paulie, they're trying to fob you off... with this musical charlatan, but I gave him the test.
DIRECTOR: I'm quite happy to be replaced.
GRANDFATHER:
He's a typical buck-passer.
- I won an award.
- JOHN: A likely story.
It's on the wall in my office.
Hello, our lot.
Everybody happy?
NORM: All right, all right.
If you don't need them...
I'll lock them up in the dressing room.
Please do. I'll not need them for half an hour.
Thank you.
Get me a bottle of milk and some tranquilizers.
I see it all now.
It's a plot... a plot.
Tranquilizers.
Come back, you lot.
I've got the key.
Come back, Ringo.
Uhh.
- Hello.
- Come on.
Leslie Jackson?
I saw your father... in the old empire in nineteen hundred and nine.
Ah, if you're as good as him, son, you're all right.
Gear costume.
- Swap?
- Cheeky.
NORM: Come, lads. First door, and no messing about.
Lennon, put them girls down, or I'll tell your mother of you.
NORM:
And stop messing about.
Stay in here until that rehearsal.
I'm going to keep you in, even if I have to put...
the lock in the key and turn it.
We're out!
We're out!
# Can't buy me love #
# Love #
# Can't buy me love #
# I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend #
# If it makes you feel all right #
# I'll get you anything, my friend #
# If it makes you feel all right #
# 'Cause I don't care too much for money #
# Money can't buy me love #
# I'll give you all I've got to give #
# If you say you love me, too #
# I may not have a lot to give #
# But what I got
I'll give to you #
# I don't care too much for money #
# Money can't buy me love #
# Can't buy me love #
# Everybody tells me so #
# Can't buy me love #
# No, no, no, no #
# Say you don't need no diamond rings #
# And I'll be satisfied #
# Tell me that you want the kind of things #
# That money just can't buy #
# I don't care too much for money #
# Money can't buy me love #
# Ow!  #
# Can't buy me love #
# Everybody tells me so #
# Can't buy me love #
# No, no, no, no #
# Say you don't need no diamond rings #

# Money can't buy me love #
# Can't buy me love #
# Love #
# Can't buy me love #
MAN: I suppose you realize this is private property.
Sorry we hurt your field, mister.
Not here. Hello, Dicky.
Probably gone to the canteen... cup of tea, like.
No, that's too easy for Lennon.
He's out there somewhere... causing trouble just to upset me.
You're imagining it, Norm.
You're letting it prey on your mind.
No. This is a battle of nerves between John and me.
But John hasn't got any.
- What?
- Nerves.
No.
That's just the trouble.
I've toyed with the idea of a ball and chain... but he'd just rattle them at me... and in public, too.
Sometimes I think he enjoys seeing me suffer.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Wait a minute. Don't tell me...
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, you are.
- I'm not.
- Oh, you are. I know you are.
- I'm not. No.
- You look just like him.
- Do I?
You're the first one that's said that ever.
Yes, you do. Look.
- No. Me eyes are lighter.
- Excuse me.
All right, noddy.
- Oh, yes. Your nose is, very.
- Me nose.
- Is it?
- Well, I would've said so.
Oh, you know him better, though.
I do not.
He's only a casual acquaintance.
- That's what you say.
- What have you heard?
- It's all over the place.
- Is it? Is it really?
Mmm, but I wouldn't have it.
I stuck up for you.
- I knew I could rely on you.
- Thanks.
You don't look like him at all.
She looks more like him than I do.
P.A. ; There will be a full rehearsal...
in ten minutes time.
Ten minutes from now, a full rehearsal.
DOLLY:
Oh, there you are.
Oh, sorry.
Must've made a mistake.
No, you haven't.
You're just late.
I am?
Actually, I think he'll be very pleased with you.
Will he?
DOLLY: Yes. You're quite a feather in the cap.
Hello?
I've got one.
Oh, I think so.
Yes, he can talk.
DOLLY: Well, I think you ought to see him.
Yes. All right.
Come on.
GEORGE: Sorry.
You don't see many of these nowadays, do you?
[Rattles]
DOLLY: Come on.
Simon, will this do?
Oh, not bad, Dolly... not really bad.
Turn around, chickie baby.
SIMON:
Oh, yes, he's a definite poss.
He'll look good alongside Susan.
All right, Sonny Jim, this is all going to be quite painless.
Don't breathe on me, Adrian.
GEORGE:
I'm terribly sorry... but there seems to be some sort of misunderstanding.
Oh, you can come off it with us.
You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop... and carry on for our benefit.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Oh, my God. He's a natural.
Well, I did tell them not to send us real ones.
They ought to know the phonies are much easier to handle.
Still, he's a good type.
We'd like you to give us your opinion... on some clothes for teenagers.
Oh, by all means.
I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally.
It'll be written out, and you'll learn it.
- Can he read?
- Of course I can.
I mean lines, ducky.
Can you handle lines?
- Well, I'll have a bash.
- Good.
Give him whatever it is they drink. A coke-a-rama?
Ta.
Well, at least he's polite.
Show him the shirts, Adrian.
SIMON:
Now, you'll like these.
You'll really dig them.
They're fab and all the other pimply hyperboles.
I wouldn't be seen dead in them.
They're dead grotty.
- Grotty?
- Yeah, grotesque.
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan.
It's rather touching, really.
Here's this kid... trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion... when I know for a fact that within a month... he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex... and loss of status... because he isn't wearing one of these nasty things.
Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit.
That's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
I won't.
You can be replaced, chickie baby.
I don't care.
And that pose is out, too,
Sonny Jim.
The new thing is to care passionately and be right wing.
Anyway, if you don't cooperate, you won't meet Susan.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
Only Susan Campy our resident teenager.
You'll have to love her.
She's your symbol.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
I beg your pardon.
Oh, yeah, the lads frequently sit round the television... and watch her for a giggle.
In fact, once we all sat down and wrote these letters... saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
She's a trendsetter.
It's her profession.
She's a drag... a well-known drag.
We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
- Get him out of here.
- Have I said something amiss?
Get him out. He's knocking the program's image.
- Sorry about the shirts.
- Get him out!
You don't think he's a new phenomenon, do you?
You mean an early clue to the new direction?
[Snaps fingers]
Where's the calendar?
Oh, no, no, no. It's all right.
He's just a troublemaker.
The change isn't due for three weeks yet.
All the same, make a note not to extend Susan's contract.
And let's not take any unnecessary chances, hmm?
[Singing in German]
[Singing in German]
[Singing continues]
So I explained to my mother that he was a very clean man.
She was quite pleased.
[Chorus singing in German]
[Footsteps]
- NORM: There's no one here.
- SHAKE: No one here?
SHAKE:
Well, where have they gone?
[Motor revs]
[Man and woman singing long high note]
[Both sing and stop]
That's wrong, isn't it?
Surely, that's wrong.
No, not you.
DIRECTOR OVER P.A. ;
Get him out!
[Voices in corridor]
There's someone coming.
Quick, hide.
Stop being taller than me.
- It's not my fault...
- Shh!
JOHN: Ha ha ha ha!
- What are you doing here?
- Hiding.
You must be soft or something.
Well, we weren't hiding.
We were resting.
I thought I told you lot to stop here.
RINGO: Well?
When I say stay put,
I mean stay put.
Don't cane me, sir.
I was led astray.
Oh, shut up, John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
Gear.
I'm dying to do a bit of work.
NORM:
Well, God bless you, Ringo.
- Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
- Crawler.
- Betrayed the class, eh?
- Aw, lay off.
- Temper, temper.
- Well?
Will you get a move on?
They're waiting for you.
Sorry.
[Woman's voice] I now declare this bridge open.
DIRECTOR:
Where are they, hmm?
Where are they?
Where are they?
- They're coming.
- Hmm?
They're coming, I promise you.
Ah, yes, well... if they aren't on this floor in thirty seconds... there'll be trouble, understand me?
Trouble.
Standing about, eh?
Some people have it dead easy.
Once you're over thirty, you're past it.
It's a young man's medium.
I just can't stand the pace.
- Oh, you're as young as that?
- I was.
JOHN: Ah, there he goes.
Look at him.
I bet his wife doesn't know about her.
He hasn't even got a wife.
Look at his sweater.
PAUL: [Laughs] You never know.
She might've knitted it.
JOHN:
She's knitted him.
DIRECTOR: Right. Standby.
Run through a number...
and try not to jiggle out of position.
Hello, three? Coming to you.
Three.
Three, coming to you. Three.
- MAN: We're on three.
- What?
- We're on three.
- Oh, yes.
DIRECTOR: Uh, music.
# I give her all my love #
# That's all I do #
# And if you saw my love #
# You'd love her, too #
# I love her #
# She gives me everything #
# And tenderly #
# The kiss my lover brings #
# She brings to me #
# And I love her #
# A love like ours #
# Could never die #
# As long as l #
# Have you near me #
# Bright are the stars that shine #
# Dark is the sky #
# I know this love of mine #
# Will never die #
# And I love her #
# Bright are the stars that shine #
# Dark is the sky #
# I know this love of mine #
# Will never die #
# And I love her #
DIRECTOR:
Thank you. Very nice.
Makeup?
No, not really.
They don't need any.
They'll just powder them off for the shine.
Oh, well, yes. Norm, would you take them down to makeup... and powder them off... the shine.
Sure.
You blinked.
- NORM: Come on. Come in.
- Hello, lads.
Hey, your grandfather's not talking to me.
I think he's got a sulk on.
It must be catching on.
He's given it to Ringo here.
Stop picking on him, George.
I don't need you to protect me, you know, Norm.
Got a touch of the swine fever, haven't you?
- No. Come on, lads. Sit down.
- This is impossible.
- We'll never get them all done.
- Then do us first.
It doesn't matter to them whether they're made up or not.
By the way, what's that?
My name's Betty.
Do you want a punch up your frogged tunic?
No.
John, behave yourself, or I'll murder you.
Shake, take that wig off.
It suits you.
- Ringo, what are you up to?
- Page five.
You always fancied yourself as a guardsman, didn't you?
Oh, that this too, too solid flesh would melt.
Zap!
Hey, you won't interfere with the basic rugged concept... of me personality, will you, madam?
Hey, he's reading the Queen.
That's an in-joke, you know.
Shazam!
It's my considered opinion that you're a bunch of sissies.
- You're just jealous.
- Leave him alone, Lennon... or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, I would, though.
I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery... and so far, I've been in a train and a room... and a car and a room and a room and a room.
Well, maybe that's all right...
for a bunch of powdered geegaws like you lot...
but I'm feeling decidedly straight-jacketed.
What a clean old man.
Ah, don't press your luck.
JOHN:
He's sex obsessed.
The older generation are leading this country... to galloping ruin.
What's a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this?
They're nearly ready for you.
Just finishing the band call.
[Piano music playing]
I say, did you go to Harrods?
I was there in '58, you know.
- I can get you on the stage.
- Oh, how?
You turn right here at the corridor... and go past the fireplace.
Ah, I don't like yours.
[Piano playing I'm Happy
Just to Dance With You]
[Piano playing I'm Happy
Just to Dance With You]
[Plays along]
JOHN:
Hey, kids, I got an idea.
Well, why don't we do the show right here? Yeah!
[Laughs]
JOHN: Two, three, four.
# Before this dance is through #
# I think I'll love you, too #
# I'm so happy when you dance with me #
# I don't want to kiss or hold your hand #
# If it's funny, try and understand #
# There is really nothing else I'd rather do #
# 'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you #
# I don't need to hug or hold you tight #
# I just want to dance with you all night #
# In this world there's nothing
I would rather do #
# 'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you #
# Just to dance with you #
# Is everything I need #
# Oh, oh #
# Before this dance is through #
# I think I'll love you, too #
# I'm so happy when you dance with me #
# If somebody tries to take my place #
# Let's pretend we just can't see his face #

JOHN: Oh.
Very good, that, George.
- Oh.
- Oh.
Well, we're trying.
JOHN: Yeah, keep trying.
Let's go. Come on.
NORM:
That was great, lads.
Now, you've got about an hour, but don't leave the theater.
Where are you going, John?
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
PAUL: So's mine.
NORM:
John, I'm talking to you.
This final run-through is important, understand?
Important.
[Oink oink]
- I want a cup of tea.
- Uh, Shake?
I've got to adjust the decibels on the inbalance, Norm.
Clever. George?
Ringo, look after him, will you?
- Oh, hey, Norm.
- Do I have to raise my voice?
All right. Come on, granddad.
I'm a drummer, not a wet nurse, you know.
GRANDFATHER:
Would you look at him... sitting there with his hooter scraping away at that book.
Well, what's the matter with that?
Have you no natural resources of your own?
Have they even robbed you of that?
- You can learn from books.
- You can, can you?
Ahh. Sheeps' heads.
You could learn more by getting out there and living.
- Out where?
- Any old where.
But not our little Richard.
Oh, no.
When you're not thumping them pagan skins... you're tormenting your eyes with that rubbish.
- Books are good.
- Parading's better.
Parading?
Parading the streets... trailing your coat, bowling along... living!
- Well, I am living.
- You? Living?
When was the last time you gave a girl...
a pink-edged daisy?
When did you last embarrass a Sheila...
with your cool appraising stare?
You're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
Well, at least
I've got a backlog of memories.
All you've got is that book.
Ah, stop picking on me. You're as bad as the rest of them.
Ah, so you are a man after all.
What's that mean?
Do you think I haven't noticed?
Do you think I wasn't aware of the drift?
You poor, unfortunate scruff.
They've driven you into books... with their cruel, unnatural treatment...
exploiting your good nature.
I don't know.
Ah, that lot's never happier unless they're jeering you.
And where would they be... without the steady support of your drum beat?
That's what I'd like to know.
Yeah. That's right.
And what's it all come to in the end?
Yeah.
What's in it for me?
A book.
Yeah, a bloomin' book.
When you could be out there... betraying a rich American widow... or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me.
Yeah, funny, really,
'cause I never thought... but being middle-aged and old... takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
You're only right.
Where are you going?
I'm going parading before it's too late.
Hey, Ringo, you know what just happened to me?
No, I don't.
You ought to stop looking so scornful.
It's twisting your face.
Tell him of the story about...
Hello, here he is, the middle-aged boy wonder.
I thought you were looking after the old man.
We've only got half an hour to the final run-through.
He can't walk out on us now.
Can't he?
He's done it, son.
- Hey, you know what happened?
- We know.
Your grandfather.
He's stirred him up.
He hasn't.
Yeah, he... he filled his head with notions seemingly.
The old mixer. Come on, we'll have to put him right.
P.A. ; Coming up, all dancers onstage for rehearsal, please.
JOHN:
Split up and look for him.
We've become a limited company.
I'll look in here again.
[This Boy playing]
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Hello there.
- Get out of it, shorty.
Hey, you should have more sense... than to go around chucking bricks about.
Southerner.
Here, mate. That's my hoop.
Stop playing with it.
Hoop? That isn't a hoop.
It's a lethal weapon.
- Have you got a license for it?
- Oh, don't be so stroppy.
Well, a boy your age rolling hoops at people.
- How old are you, anyway?
- Eleven.
- I bet you're only 101/2.
There you are, then, and don't be rolling at people.
Oh, you can have it. I'm packing it in. It depresses me.
- Y'what?
- You heard. It gets on my wick.
That's lovely talk, that is.
And why aren't you at school?
- I'm a deserter.
- Are you now?
- Yeah, I've blown school out.
- Just you?
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon, and Ding Dong.
- Oh, Ding Dong bell, eh?
- Yeah, that's right.
They was supposed to come with us, but they chickened.
RINGO: Yeah? And they're your mates, are they?
Yeah.
RINGO: Not much cop without 'em, is it?
- Oh, it's all right.
- Yeah? What are they like?
BOY: Ginger's mad.
He says things all the time.
And Eddy's good at spitting and punching.
Yeah?
How about Ding Dong?
Oh, he's a big head.
He fancies himself, you know.
He's all right, though,
'cause he's one of the gang.
Hmm.
- Why aren't you at work?
- I'm a deserter, too.
- Oh.
- Hey, Charlie!
See ya!
MAN: Come in, number seven.
Your time's up.
I'm sorry, boys.
I didn't mean it, honest.
If he says that again,
I'll strike him.
Oh, don't worry. They're good lads. They'll be back.
Well, we've only twenty minutes to the final run-through.
I meant no harm.
I was only trying to encourage little Ringo to enjoy himself.
God knows what you've unleashed on the unsuspecting south.
It'll be wine, women, and song all the way with Ringo... when he gets the taste for it.
That was fresh this morning.
Two and nine.
[Parrot screeching]
- Right. On your way.
- You what?
You heard. On your way.
Troublemaker!
Hey, watch it!
- Shake.
- What?
Worry, will you?
Well, that's it. Two minutes to the final run-through.
- They're bound to miss it now.
- I'll murder that Lennon.
We could survive a missed run-through as long as they...
SHAKE: As long as they end up for the show?
Oh, you're right there.
I mean, it wouldn't do...
to miss the show, like, would it?
NORM: Shut up, cheerful.
You don't think...
Oh, oh, oh no.
- Now, look, don't worry.
- They can't do this to me, no.
It's all your fault.
Oh, yes, it is.
If they don't turn up
I wouldn't be in your shoes...
For all the tea in China.
Oh, you're right there.
Neither would it.
- You dirty traitor.
- Well, of course.
Yes, of course.
BEATLES:? I have been working like a dog #
- Hello.
- Hi, John. John!
- Did you want something?
- I could eat the lot of you.
You'd look great with an apple in your gob.
Do you realize you could have missed the final run-through?
Oh, we're sorry about that.
Norm?
There's only three of 'em.
Oh, we were looking for Ringo... but we realized he must've come back here.
Well, do you realize that we are on the air live...
in front of an audience in forty-five minutes... and you're one short?
JOHN: Control yourself, or you'll spurt.
He must be here somewhere.
Aye, well, we'll look in the dressing room.
- Shake.
- Yes, the dressing room.
Hey, where's my grandfather?
Don't worry about him, Paul.
He can look after himself.
I suppose so.
Personally signed and handwritten... by your own sweet boys.
- The chance of a lifetime!
- [Fans screaming]
Be the envy of your less fortunate sisters!
GRANDFATHER: Oh, me bones.
All right, break it up.
Break it up. Move on.
Hey, what's going on here?
Right, move over. Move over.
- Come on, move along.
- Here you are.
Why don't you go back home?
You're making a disturbance.
Will you just move along now?
[Indistinct arguing]
Come on, ya. Aah! Yeahh!
[Ringo humming]
Thank you.
[Humming]
- [Whistles]
- Gotcha!
You nasty little person, you.
RINGO:
Come on! Ooh, yeah.
I'm Ringo Starr.
I've got a show to do.
I'm on in a few minutes.
You've got to let me go.
I'm Ringo.
Yeah, that's what they all say these days.
Look, I don't care who you are.
You can save that for the stipendiary.
- Here you are, sarge.
- All right. What is he?
Yeah, I got a little list here.
Wandering abroad, malicious intent... acting in a suspicious manner... conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace.
OFFICER:
You name it, he's done it.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Yeah, a proper little aborigine.
- I demand to see my solicitor.
- What's his name?
Well, if you're gonna get technical about it.
GRANDFATHER: Dragging me through the streets...
Hello, it's gonna be one of those nights, is it?
Sit Charlie Peace down over there, will you?
Well, you got me here, so do your worst... but, by God,
I'll take one of you with me.
- Ow!
- I know your game!
Get me into that tiled room and then out come the rubber hoses.
Oh, there's a fire, is there?
You ugly great brute.
You have sadism... stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
- Eh?
- I'll go on hunger strike.
I know your caper.
The kidney punch and the rabbit clout.
The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle tap.
What's he on about?
GRANDFATHER: I'm a soldier of the republic.
You'll need the mahogany truncheon on this boyo.
# A nation once again #
# A nation once again #
Get Lloyd George over there... next to the mechanic in the cloth cap... while I sort this lot out, will you?
OFFICER: Come on, dad.
Sit down over here.
Ringo, me old scout!
So they grabbed your leg for the iron, too, have they?
I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
Shh, shh.
Have they roughed you up yet?
What?
Oh, they're a desperate crew of drippings... and they've fists like matured hams... for pounding poor defenseless lads like you.
Right, that's it, then.
GRANDFATHER:
One of us has got to escape.
I'll get the boys.
- Hold on. I'll be back for you.
- For me?
If they get you on the floor, watch out for your brisket.
They seem all right to me.
Ah, sure, that's what they want you to think.
All coppers are villains.
SERGEANT: Would you two like a cup of tea?
See? Sly villains.
Um, no, thank you,
Mr. Sergeant, sir.
No, not for me. Please don't.
So you just brought the old chap... out of the crowd for his own good, eh?
Well, he was getting a bit nasty, you see... so we had to bring him in.
Well, he can't stop here.
This is the stuff he's been hawking around, eh?
- Yes, sergeant... photographs.
- Photographs.
Well, son, it's now or never.
All right, you paid assassins!
Johnny McCartney... will give you a run for your thruppence halfpenny.
Hey, you forgot your photographs.
Only half an hour, and you're on.
- Can I say something?
- Yes. Anything.
It seems highly unlikely we'll be on.
I mean, the law of averages are against it.
I think if you could get the juggler on... with a couple more clubs... that would fill in a bit of time.
Come on, let's go!
I'll have the hides off of you lot.
[Laughing]
You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Go home.
I must see Pauly.
Go home, then, and see him on the telly.
- Can you fix him for me?
- Yeah.
Sixpence.
- Each.
- In advance.
Mercenaries.
[Laughing]
It's all right.
Leave him alone.
P.A. ; What's up, Richard?
GRANDFATHER:
Paul? Where are you? I'm...
PAUL:
Granddad. Where's Ringo?
The police have the poor lad in the bridewell.
- The police station.
- He'll be pulp by now.
- NORM: Go get him!
- PAUL: We'll get him out.
- JOHN: We'll fix it, Norm.
- [Beatles barking]
We've only got twenty minutes.

# 'Cause I don't care too much for money #
# Money can't buy me love #
# I'll give you all I've got to give #
# If you say you'll love me, too #
# I may not have a lot to give #

# Tell me that you want the kind of things #
# That money just can't buy #
# I don't care too much for money #
# Money can't buy me love #
What is all this?
[Panting] Hold on till we catch our breath.
Fine.
Are you all right now?
[Pants] Yeah.
- Huh?
- See.
# Can't buy me love #
# Everybody tells me so #
# Can't buy me love #

I had to laugh even when they kick the stool away.
I had to laugh even when they kick the stool away.
[Giggles]
Lads. Lads! You're back!
Thank goodness. Where's Ringo?
- There he is. We got him.
- Great, great, great.
You don't know what this means to me.
If you hadn't come back, it would have meant... the epilogue or news in Welsh for life.
Hey, aren't you supposed to be in that box?
- Yeah, where's the old mixer?
- Here, Pauly.
Got a few words to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
Aw, leave him alone.
He's back, isn't he?
- It's not his fault he's old.
- What's old got to do with it?
He's a troublemaker and a mixer.
That's good enough for me.
You're right. He's only asking for attention, aren't you?
You see, you know your trouble.
You should've gone west to America.
You would've been a senior citizen of Boston.
But you took a wrong turn, and what happened?
You're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
- But I'm clean.
- Are you?
- Hey, Norm.
- What?
I've been thinking.
- It's not my fault.
- What isn't?
I'm not taller than you are.
You're smaller than I am.
Anyone at home?
Hey, Shake, where's me boot?
Will you get us some tea while you're there?
- All right, George.
- Ta.
- Come on, lads. Get changed.
- Come on, get some tea.

[Audience screaming]
Now, I've got the stuff.
Come here, lads.
- Aren't we going...
- No, we're not.
The office has been on the phone and think it's best... if we push on to Wolverhampton straight away.
- Tonight? We'll never make it.
- You've got a midnight matinee.
Aye, Norm!
There's only one thing I've got to say to you, John Lennon.
- What?
- You're a swine.
# It's been a hard day's night #
# And I've been working like a dog #
# It's been a hard day's night #
# I should be sleeping like a log #
# But when I get home to you #
Come on, you're hanging up the parade!
Get rid of those things!
# You know I work all day #
# To get you money to buy you things #
# And it's worth it just to hear you say #
# You're gonna give me everything #
# So why on earth should I moan #
# 'Cause when I get you alone #
# You know I feel OK #
# When I'm home #
# When I'm home #
# Everything seems to be right #
# When I'm home #
# Feeling you holding me tight #
# Tight, yeah #
# It's been a hard day's night #
# And I've been working like a dog #
# It's been a hard day's night #
# I should be sleeping like a log #
# But when I get home to you #
# I find the things that you do #
# Will make me feel all right #
# Aah #
# So why on earth should I moan #
# 'Cause when I get you alone #
# You know I feel OK #
# When I'm home #
# Everything seems to be right #
# When I'm home #
# Feeling you holding me tight #
# Tight, yeah #
# It's been a hard day's night #

# You know I feel all right #
# You know I feel all right #
All right. All right, everybody!
- My daughter needs a pink spot.
- Never mind now.
You'll all get a chance.
Herbie. Come here, Herbie.
- We were here first.
- The mothers again.
- Forget the mothers.
- Get 'em out.
I don't want the mothers in the wings.
I don't want 'em in the house!
They're only tryin' to help the kids.
Don't argue with me, Herbie.
Mothers, please, will you get out?
Get off stage!
I want you to come forward one at a time.
And now let's have the first wee lad on Uncle Jocko's Kiddie Kapers.
Take 'em each from the top, then cut to the last eight.
All right!
Uncle Jocko presents
Clarence and his clarinet.
Go ahead, kid.
Cut to the end! To the end, kiddo!
And who does Uncle Jocko have here?
Baby June and Company.
I'm "and Company." I mean, I assist.
That is until Mama finds out what I do best. She's workin' on it.
You seem like nice kids, but I've only got time for half your routine.
Let's have it fast, forte and off. Okay?
Herbie, come here.
That one's gotta get the contract.
The one with the balloons.
The one that gets it is the one with talent.
- I'm the boss and I pick the cast.
- And I'm getting sick of it, George.
Gus, hit this doll with a surprise pink when she does her turn, huh?
And now Uncle Jocko presents
Baby June and Company.
"Let me entertain you
"Let me see you smile
"I will do some kicks
"I will do some tricks
"I'll tell you a story
"I'll dance when she's done"
Sing out, Louise! Sing out!
Now quiet. Who said that?
You're behind, Louise.
Catch up, dear, catch up.
Hold it! Hold it!
Get off the stage, please!
Didn't I see your sensitive face at the Odd Fellows Hall?
I'm not an Odd Fellow.
- Knight of Pythias.
- I'm not a Knight of Pythias.
- Aren't you anything?
- I'm an Elk.
I should have known it by your good manners.
My father's an Elk, too.
1853 Seattle, Washington.
I got his tooth here someplace.
I'm an Honorable Elk.
Hi, Bill.
Mind holding Chowsie?
That's short for Chow Mein.
Mama just loves chow mein.
Stop sucking your thumb, Louise.
I just marvel how you can make a performer into an artist.
So you can help my little girls by giving them a nice loud "da-de-da de-da-da."
Mr. Zipser, when my girls do their specialty would you ad-lib it?
- Sure.
- Show 'em, girls.
- You're the boss. What do I do?
- Get her out!
Mr. Electrical!
Would you please spot Baby June?
The one with all the movement.
Each movement has a meaning of it's own.
Hit her with something pink.
Or would you prefer amber?
I never can make up my mind what color to use.
Decisions, decisions, decisions!
She's ready for the big time.
We'd be there too if we had first-class management.
Big time?
Open time, layoff time, big time.
Boy, is she...
Is that so? Don't you laugh.
Don't you dare laugh!
Please, let us get on.
- We're not finished.
- You are according to me.
'Cause you're playing favorites with
Miss Balloon? Louise heard every word.
How dare you let that untalented balloon block up my babies!
I won't leave this stage till she does.
Have you no loyalty to the Elks?
- It's not a question of Elks, but of talent.
- My girls have the only talent on the stage.
I'll tell that to the editor of the Gazette.
Which it so happens, he's an Elk.
I'll also shout out loud the whole audition is bein' fixed because of her.
You get in the wings and wait.
Thank you, Professor.
Thank you, Jocko.
Herbie, come here.
Thank you, Mr. Zipser.
I don't care who she shouts on, we sign the balloon.
You sign, I resign!
Hit it, girls!
Uncle Jocko was a gent. He quit.
And I made the usual arrangements with my wedding rings.
Pawned them.
All three of them. And we all started back to Pa's house in Seattle to refinance.
We were like an advancing army on the big time, backfirin' all the way.
Mama, I've been thinking.
How come I have three fathers?
Because you're lucky.
Does it have to be this cold, Mama?
Breathe hard on each other, kids, and hold that Thermos up against you.
Why does this pile of junk have to be stopping all the time?
Because it isn't going, Mama.
The trouble's got to be in either the universal joint or the rear end.
Now, now. No dirty talk.
Don't worry. Whatever it is, I'll fix it.
I think something melted.
Look, Mama.
What are we gonna do?
We'll break our jump.
There must be a theater in this hamlet.
We'll get a hitch into town, which means we'll go see one of Mama's brothers.
Have you got brothers in this town, too, Mama?
Practically all men in America are Mama's brothers.
Like your grandpa says:
"You can always tell the size of a man's heart by the button in his lapel."
What would Grandpa say about this automobile, Mama?
He'd ask if it was insured.
It is, isn't it?
Only for fire.
Get everything out.
I smell smoke!
Mr. Willis, don't give me that stuff about what the other salesman used to sell you.
How much of his candy did you sell?
Practically zero. He steered you wrong.
You're not on the ball with your patrons selling plain chocolate bars.
It's like women wearing bustles.
Now this is an era of flaming youth.
Of flappers, of shifters.
It's a world that crunches.
What should you sell?
Crunchy Butterfingers.
Crispy Baby Ruths covered with our nourishing milk chocolate, safe for a baby.
I'm gonna put you down for 100 gross, Mr. Willis.
I personally guarantee you'll reorder within a month.
- Ten dozen chocolate bars.
- You're cheating yourself. Here.
Ask her what her kids eat.
Butterfingers, so help me.
I speak as a mother.
Who'd argue with a mother?
Not me. Twenty dozen assorted.
Are you the woman Buffalo
Mr. Beckman called me about?
I certainly am. I came to discuss the act.
- Now, how big is your orchestra?
- Three pieces. Piano, cover and stool.
- What kind of act do you do?
- It's great. I caught it in LA.
- You two a team?
- I've never seen him before.
I speak only as a pro.
Well, sometimes I play an act when I got a weak movie.
Tell you the truth, lady,
I got a weak movie.
But this town's very brotherhood-minded
Buffalo-wise.
Are you sure you're a lady Buffalo?
Honorary.
- Now we can talk turkey.
- Turkey's 60-40.
That's a deal.
She gets the 60, you get the 40.
But no guarantee.
With a town full of Buffaloes, she doesn't need a guarantee.
I don't like it, but I'm stuck with my Buffalo oath.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go to the ladies room and fix the sink.
- Thanks for getting me that 60.
- Thanks for getting me this order.
Thanks for saying you caught the act in LA.
I did. Hello, Chowsie.
I was Uncle Jocko.
Uncle Jocko! Well, where's your goggles and tam-o'-shanter?
How come you're sellin' candy?
I quit the profession, thanks to you.
Me?
You triggered it down in LA.
I had this candy bar proposition for a long time and I'm singing like a bird.
I tip the Fedora to you.
Name is Herbie Sommers.
Hovick. Rose Hovick.
How come you quit the profession to become a candy butcher?
Because, lady, Rose...
The profession is makin' a buck the hard way.
Not if it's in your blood.
When you say that, you look like a pioneer woman without a frontier.
Is that good or bad?
It's good. You've got what it takes.
You won't let the world push you around.
Say, it's that fashionable cocktail hour again, Rose.
I'd like to buy you a small booze and a bite to eat.
Now, there's a local speak which has fair gin but dandy chow mein...
...if you happen to go in for Chinese food.
Is there any other kind?
Say, you're a regular Irene Castle, Rose.
Everybody in my family is except Louise.
- But you're working on it.
- You bet I am.
She must be able to do somethin'.
But June is already the show-biz whiz.
She's a worker all right.
I'd like to see her in a big flash act.
A lot of scenery.
Maybe six little girls behind her.
All brunettes to show off her blondness.
To really show her off, you oughta back her up with boys, like Ziegfeld does.
What does he know about vaudeville?
My mind's made up, it'll be girls.
No, you're wrong, Rose, it oughta be boys.
I don't need any advice from a candy butcher.
Check, please.
Herbie, don't get so mad.
I know I need advice.
I know I need management.
- I know everybody in the business.
- Who?
- Later, boy, later.
- Yes, ma'am.
Who don't I know?
That's a better question.
In my time, I've met them all: Mr. Albee,
Mr. Loew, even Mr. Goldstone.
You know what Mr. Goldstone says when he sees me?
What?
He says, "Hello, Herbie."
Hello, Herbie.
Hello, Rose.
I like you.
You certainly didn't show it when we auditioned for you in LA.
We had so many stage mothers there...
- I hate to see mothers exploiting their kids.
- Not me.
I'm a mother first and don't you forget it.
That's why I'm taking the girls back to Seattle to my father's house.
So that June can go to the dentist and Louise can get her tonsils out.
I knew you were a good mother.
Wanna know something?
I'm crazy for mothers.
Yeah? Anybody who likes mothers so much should have been a father.
I never married. I had five sisters.
The ugly one didn't marry until a year ago.
She's pregnant now.
I don't like dirty talk.
- I apologize.
- No need to. You're a gent and I like gents.
Does that mean you'd consider marrying again?
Not me. I don't mean for instance, but anybody?
After three husbands it takes a lot o' butter to get you back in the frying pan.
How much butter, Rose?
That all depends on who's dishing it out.
This time he'd have to be in the profession.
Why? After 20 years of show business...
No, you kind of breathe better in the real world.
- Funny.
- What?
Us.
I like you, but I don't want marriage.
You like me.
You don't want show business.
That seems to leave you there and me here.
Now that depends on how you look at it.
You look at what we don't have.
I look at what we do have.
"Funny
"You're a stranger who's come here
"Come from another town
"Funny
"I'm a stranger myself here
"Small world, isn't it?
"Funny
"You're a man who goes travelling
"Rather than settlin' down
"Funny
"'Cause I love to go travellin'
"Small world, isn't it?
"We have so much in common
"It's a phenomenon
"We could pool our resources
"By joining forces
"From now on
"Lucky
"You're a man who likes children
"That's an important sign
"Lucky
"I'm a woman with children
"Small world, isn't it?
"Funny, isn't it?
"Small and funny
"And fine"
Sometimes it's a real fine world, Rose...
...like tonight.
Yeah.
But there's tomorrow.
Tomorrow I gotta get those kids on a train and, gee, Herbie, how they hate trains.
Where's your next stop?
I'm goin' back east to Chicago and the home office.
Chicago?
Do you know Mr. Weber of the Weber Theater in Chicago?
He likes kid acts.
Maybe you could talk to him.
Be a cinch.
Might also be a cinch for me to drive you and your beautiful family to Seattle.
- I couldn't ask you to go out of your way.
- Why not?
Seattle's just a hop, skip and a jump...
I wouldn't mind a hop, skip and a jump, if you'd sit in the front seat with me.
And I like company, especially children.
You like kumquat? Fortune cookies?
- No, I want the check now, though.
- Yes, sir.
I have a suggestion.
If you'd like to test my driving, just hop into the old flivver right now.
I'll show you the view from Lookout Mountain.
Sure, Herbie. Just wait'll I get my hat.
And my hatpin.
So everything was comin' up roses.
Herbie drove us all the way to Seattle.
It was a pleasure to have a man behind the wheel.
All right, let's face it, it was a pleasure to have a man.
This is the end of the line, Rose.
I'll sure be missing you all a lot.
- I owe you money for lunches and stuff.
- Mark it on ice.
Grandpa!
- Hello, sweethearts.
- Hi, Grandpa.
- I've been worried crazy.
- You worry too much, Pa.
I want you to meet Mr. Sommers, a very big gentleman in the candy game.
- Herbie, this is my father.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance, sir.
Glad to meet you.
Did the express company deliver our valises?
Yeah, to the station, collect.
Pa was head of the baggage room at the Kings St. Station.
Pa also plays the piano good.
Pa could've been a real pro.
You just stop with that show talk.
Guess I'll be shovin'.
I'll be seeing ya, Rose.
I'll be seeing ya, Herbie.
I'll be seeing ya, kids.
I'll be seeing ya, Herbie.
I'll be seeing ya.
I'll be seeing ya. More show talk.
- Goodbye, Rose.
- So long, Herbie.
"Act opens Weber Theater, Chicago.
Split week beginning April 20th.
"$300. Agreement calls for four boys and two girls.
"Confirm and rush photos.
Kindest personal regards.
"Love, Herbie
P.S. Don't forget, four boys."
Four boys. I gotta teach that Herbie not to be so pig-headed.
I think Herbie's right, Ma.
Boys would be good in the act.
But they better have talent!
Whose act is this?
We've gotta get some dollars to get to Chicago.
Give me the jewelry, kids.
Mama, do we have to stay in show business?
Hurry up, darling.
Honest, Louise! How are you going to get the boys, Mama?
We'll get 'em. Louise can be a boy.
We got that jiggin' kid from Klamath Falls.
Herbie and I'll get the others.
- How're we gonna pay them?
- Experience'll be their pay.
If I can hock this stuff, I'll get a down payment for costumes and scenery.
Then we'll squeeze money out of Grandpa...
...and we're on our way to Chicago and the big time.
I gotta get that Reo I saw for sale for 88 simoleons.
Pa! Oh, Pa!
Yeah?
Maybe you think I don't know you been connivin' behind my back.
I didn't want to tell you till it was sure.
We're booked, Pa.
I got almost enough for incidentals.
I know you'll put up the rest.
Oh, bunk!
Something wonderful will happen for my girls.
Bunk!
I've had a dream, Pa.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself, fooling our kids with those dreams?
They're real dreams and I'll make 'em come real for my kids.
What are you, a crazy woman?
Heaven put you here because it meant for you to stay right here.
Heaven helps those who help themselves.
And I need your help, Pa!
You squeezed the last penny out of me you'll ever get!
It's too late for me. It's for my kids!
It's not too late for you to get a husband to support you.
After three husbands,
I'm through with marriage.
I want to enjoy myself.
I want my girls to enjoy themselves.
And travel like Mama does.
Yeah, and you'll leave them just like your mother left you.
Never! I don't want them to sit their lives away the way I did.
And the way you do, with nothing but a calendar to tell you...
...one day is different from the next.
And that plaque!
From your grateful railroad company, to say congratulations.
For 50 years you did the same dull thing every dull day.
That plaque is a great tribute.
It's solid gold.
Yeah?
How much could you get for it?
Rose, if you...
What good's it doing hanging there?
That plaque belongs there.
Like you belong home instead of running around the country like a gypsy.
Anybody that stays home is dead.
If I die it won't be from sitting, it'll be from fighting to get up and get out!
"Some people can get a thrill
"Knitting sweaters and sittin' still
"That's okay for some people

"That's perfect for some people

"And he was saying to me, 'Rose
"'Get yourself some new orchestrations
New routines and red velvet curtains
"'Get a feathered hat for the baby

"'Get an agent and in jig time

"Oh, what a dream
"A wonderful dream, Papa
"And all that I need
"Is 88 bucks, Papa
"That's what he said, Papa
"Only 88 bucks"
You ain't gettin' eight cents from me, Rose.
I'll get it someplace else then.
But I'll get it and I'll get my kids out!
"Goodbye to blueberry pie
"Good riddance to all the socials
I had to go to
"All the lodges I had to play
All the Shriners I said hello to
"Hey, New York, I'm comin' your way
"Some people sit on their butts
"Got the dream, yeah, but not the guts
"That's livin' for some people
"For some humdrum people I suppose
"Well, they can stay and rot!
"But not Rose!"
We blew into the Windy City to break in our new flash act.
Herbie, makin' out like Uncle Jocko, got us the boys.
The only thing that bugged me was our spot on the bill...
...following some unknown stand-up comic.
My girl is so dumb she was fired from the five-and-ten cents store...
...because she couldn't remember the prices.
And her uncle, she's got an uncle,
I won't say that he...
...he drank too much you see, but two years after he died...
...his liver won a Charleston contest.
How about that one, huh?
Well, listen, I can't go any bigger than that.
So good night, folks.
I'll be seeing you soon.
Well, let's see your kids follow that.
What a ham!
Yeah. He'll never get anyplace.
"Extra, extra!
"Hey, look at the headlines
Historical news is being made
"Extra, extra!
"They're drawing a red line
Around the biggest scoop of the decade
"A barrel o' charm
A fabulous thrill
"The biggest little headline in vaudeville
"Presenting in person
"That 3-foot-3 bundle of dynamite
"Baby June!"
Hello, everybody. My name is June.
What's yours?
"Let me entertain you
"Let me make you smile
"Let me do a few tricks
Some old and some new tricks
"I'm very versatile
"And if you're real good
I'll make you feel good
"I want your spirits to climb
"So let me entertain you
"And we'll have a real good time
Yes, sir
"We'll have a real good time"
Mr. Conductor, if you please.
Was I right about June or was I right?
In the next couple of years she killed the people on the big time.
We were Dainty June now and we headlined the Orpheum Circuit.
Boy, was I ever happy.
My dream was in high gear.
But after a while the booking offices were in low.
Instead of 52 weeks solid, the next year we signed for only 44.
And the following season, we laid off as much as we played.
But we worked more than most.
Like this split week
Herbie booked in Newark.
Newark is in New Jersey and New Jersey is only one big deep breath from New York.
And in New York was Grantziger's Tivoli.
And that was my real big dream.
But did you ever notice something's always wakin'you up?
It ain't even noon yet. Turn it off.
Please!
Turn it off, Plug.
Was that the alarm?
No, it was Major Bowes and you just got the gong.
Surprise!
Happy birthday, Louise.
Happy birthday, Louise.
Wild Indians. Wild Indians, that's what you are.
Happy birthday, darling.
- Come on, make a wish.
- Yeah.
Oh, I wish...
Oh, Mama, I wish...
That greedy monkey ate a piece out of the cake.
Bad, Gigolo. Bad, bad, bad.
Blow out the candles, Louise.
Say, that'd make a good coat.
There's only ten candles on this cake.
What do you care?
You're not eating candles.
Yeah, but she only had ten candles last year and the year before that.
Come to think of it, she's had ten candles for the last...
Stop right there.
As long as we have this act, nobody is over 12.
And you all know it. Except me, of course.
You can give Louise her presents while I see if the chow mein is warmed up.
Chow mein?
It's my birthday.
But chow mein for breakfast?
Why not? There's an egg roll, isn't there?
If your mother paid us a salary, we could've all bought you presents.
But it's more fun to clip from the five-and-dime anyway.
It's a catcher's mitt and a big league baseball.
Gee, thanks, Yonkers.
I clipped a bowl of goldfish...
...but they caught me, so I drew a fish instead.
It's beautiful.
Here, Louise.
Oh, June.
You shouldn't have done that.
Gee, what a beautiful box.
Oh, it's lined in velvet.
Sure, it's for diamonds and like that...
...because someday, who knows, you might get some.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
Here, I should've wrapped it.
It's a chicken and it plays music.
You don't have to wrap a music box, Tulsa.
Well, happy birthday, Plug.
Happy birthday, Tulsa.
I mean, you're welcome.
All right, only one egg roll apiece.
I counted them. No more.
Take it easy.
Don't claw each other to death.
Now, I wanna tell you about a dream I had.
It's really in your honor, comin' on your birthday.
Baby, you'll love it. You all will.
Children, it's a new act.
That ain't a dream, it's a miracle.
In this act I saw June singing a song in like a barnyard.
And then...
...a cow came onstage.
A cow?
That's pretty sophisticated.
Not a real cow. Sort of a dancin' cow, with a great big smile.
That cow...
That cow leaned right over my bed and spoke to me.
What did the cow say?
Mrs. Hovick!
I am not cooking in here, Mr. Kringelein.
That cow, in front of...
- Open up this door!
- I'm dressing. That cow...
Mrs. Hovick!
I'll call you tomorrow when I'm finished.
Now about that cow.
Mrs. Hovick!
That dear, talented cow looked me right in the eye and said:
"Rose, if you want to get back on the Orpheum Circuit...
"...you put me in your act."
You know what I'm gonna do?
You're gonna pay that talented cow and not us.
I'm not payin' anybody but I'm takin' that cow's advice.
I'm gonna call the new act,
"Dainty June and Her Farm Boys."
I'll put the cow in the act, and Chowsie and the monkey.
Everybody works. Let me tell you this:
Kids, this is real big time.
I really had an inspiration.
No cooking, Mrs. Hovick.
The very idea of entering a woman's boudoir without knocking!
Where's your hot plate?
- Where's your search warrant?
- In all my years running a theatrical hotel...
Leave, or your name'll be mud throughout the entire theatrical profession.
You know the rules. No cooking.
No sterno stoves. No percolators.
No electric irons turned upside down.
No dogs and no...
Happy birthday, darling.
This is Herbie's birthday present to you.
Why, it's a damned zoo.
Profanity in front of my babies.
June, get the Bible. Get the Bible.
I'll report you to the Board of Health, and my friends. Hello, Gladys.
You can just pack up this menagerie and get out of here!
You'll have to throw us out, you heartless animal hater.
- Send for the SPCA.
- Send for the police.
Why, I rented this producer's suite to one adult and three children!
Now I see one adult and one, two, three, four...
You counted him twice.
It's a simple birthday party for my child.
One, two, three, four...
Stand still!
I'd offer you some chow mein, but there's only one egg roll.
One, two, three, four, five...
How many people are sleeping in these rooms?
- What rooms?
- This room, madam.
Why there isn't a soul in this room.
- Now, you know what I mean.
- Except you and me, honey.
Mr. Kringelein, what are you tryin' to do?
Stop! Help! Help!
Mr. Kringelein, stop! Help!
- Oh, my babies!
- Mama!
A peeping tom. A monster.
Oh, my babies! My babies!
Get her some water.
Gladys, a simple little birthday party.
Chow mein. A tiny little cake.
Thank you, darling. Can you imagine?
These dangerous middle-aged men.
You never know what sort of beasts and brutes you'll meet...
Rose, what happened?
Mr. Kringelein, the hotel manager, tried to...
Again?
I had to do something, Herbie.
And don't you dare apologize to him.
I hope it didn't spoil Louise's birthday.
Why should it? Thank you, everyone.
- Back to your rooms now.
- Yes, thank you. Thank you.
You, too.
No.
Rose, this is Mr. Goldstone.
Mr. Goldstone, the child has a birthday once a year.
We have a small party, a tiny little cake...
The act is booked at the Tivoli Theater.
...fried rice and subgum chow...
Mr. Goldstone puts on the Grantziger shows.
He practically has the last word.
We just have to show the act to Mr. Grantziger.
Mr. Goldstone says that's a cinch.
"Have an egg roll, Mr. Goldstone
"Have a napkin
Have a chopstick
"Have a chair
"Have a sparerib, Mr. Goldstone
"Any sparerib that I can spare
I'd be glad to share
"Have a dish
Have a fork
"Have a fish
Have a pork
"Put your feet up, feel at home
"Have a smoke
Have a Coke
"Would you like to hear a joke?
I'll have June recite a poem
"Have a lichee, Mr. Goldstone
"Tell me any little thing that I can do
"A ginger peachy, Mr. Goldstone
"Have a kumquat, have two
"Everybody give a cheer
Santa Claus is sittin' here
"Mr. Goldstone, I love you
"Have a Goldstone, Mr. Egg Roll
"Tell me any little thing that I can do
"Have some fried rice, Mr. Soy Sauce
"Have a cookie
Have a few
"What's the matter, Mr. G?
Have another pot of tea
"Mr. Goldstone, I love you
"There are good stones
And bad stones
"And curbstones and Gladstones
"And touchstones
And such stones as them
"Such as them
"There are big stones
And small stones
"And grindstones and gallstones
"But Goldstone is a gem
"There are milestones
There are millstones
"There's a cherry
There's a yellow
"There's a blue
"But we don't want any old stone
"Only Goldstone will do
"Moonstone, sunstone
We all scream for one stone
"Mervyn Goldstone
"We love you
"Goldstone!"
"Little lamb, little lamb
"My birthday is here at last
"Little lamb, little lamb
"A birthday goes by so fast
"Little bear, little bear
"You sit on my right, right there
"Little hen, little hen
"What games should we play and when?
"Little cat, little cat
"Oh, why do you look so blue?
"Did somebody paint you like that?
"Or is it your birthday, too?
"Little fish, little fish
"Do you think I'll get my wish?
"Little lamb, little lamb
"I wonder how old I am
"I wonder how old I am
"Little lamb"
The won ton soup is better in San Francisco.
The fu yung has more egg in it in St. Louis.
But I will say New York City...
...has got the best doggone, subgum chicken chow mein I ever tasted.
The onions are chopped good and fine.
Hand me that plate.
Mother!
We're payin' for it, aren't we?
You'll get an ulcer like Herbie.
Besides, what the dogs don't eat, we will.
Did it ever occur to you there might be someone who doesn't like Chinese food?
Don't be silly! Who?
You like it, don't you, Herbie?
Of course, I love it.
- Did she?
- Yes.
That's a healthy-wealthy lady-wady.
Oh, Lord!
Herbie's angry. He's chain-smoking.
Herbie's never angry. It's bad for his ulcer.
Come on now, girls, beddy-bye.
But it's so early.
Baby, tomorrow you're gonna audition for
Mr. T.T. Grantziger and his Tivoli Theater.
You gotta look young.
Can I wear a dress?
A dress'd make you look old, and you don't own one.
- Good night, Uncle Herbie.
- Good night, June.
- Good night, Louise.
- Good night, Herbie.
I'll cold cream their faces and be right back.
The hotel is just two doors away.
Honestly, the way you behave with those girls. Rose!
We need silverware for when we set up housekeepin' on Riverside Drive.
You're so high and mighty with a suite at the Astor and you still steal the cutlery.
You gotta grasp every opportunity.
Herbie, how long is it gonna take you to get used to me?
How long did it take me to get used to those coats?
What's wrong with them?
Louise is very handy with a needle.
As the Lord says,
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
And it serves 'em right for overcharging.
They can skip the cold cream for one night.
All this time we've been together and you still stand up for me.
- It's instead of standing up to you.
- I hope the babies'll be all right.
Rose, no matter how you dress them, or smother them, they're not babies.
- They're almost young women!
- They're not and they never will be!
I'm embarrassed in front of them.
Why should you be?
You're almost their father.
- When are you going to marry me?
- Don't forget our scrapbooks...
- When are you going to quit stalling?
- When we're rolling in dough.
- Do you know there's a depression?
- Sure I know. I read Variety.
You know what it's doing to vaudeville?
Do you know what the talkies are doing to vaudeville? Don't you know...
...I love you?
Do you think I'd be unfaithful to my husbands if you didn't?
I gotta think of my girls and their happiness.
Louise is some happy being the front end of a cow.
- It's better than the rear end.
- She and June should be in school.
I promised June I'd get her on the Pantages Circuit and I did.
Honey, could I have a spoon to stir my tea?
I promised her I'd get her on the Orpheum Circuit and I will.
I will. And you promised me that after I do you'd marry me.
I promised myself she'd be a headliner at the Tivoli Theater and she will.
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes, but I'm ignoring it.
Thanks, honey.
Herbie, it isn't very polite of a gentleman to remind a lady that she welched.
Besides, there was no date on that promise.
Will you stop handing me that?
Rose, sometimes...
Your stomach!
Why don't you get angry on the outside instead of lettin' it settle inside?
- I'm afraid.
- Of me?
No, of me. Me.
Why?
If I ever let loose, it'll end up with me picking up and walking.
- Only around the block.
- Oh, no!
Don't say that.
"You'll never get away from me
"You can climb the tallest tree
"I'll be there somehow
"True, you could say
'Hey, here's your hat'
"But a little thing like that
"Couldn't stop me now
"I couldn't get away from you
"Even if you told me to
"So go on and try, just try
"And you're gonna see
"How you're gonna not at all
"Get away from me"
What do you want?
There are better managers.
Not for me.
- Even weaker men.
- Not for me.
- Then what?
- You.
Herbie, just go on helping me like you've been helpin'.
So you get the Tivoli, so what comes after?
- Rose, what you expect...
- I'll get!
And after I get it, I promise to marry you.
I even promise to keep my promise.
Herbie, I don't want anything to upset that audition tomorrow...
...includin' your stomach.
Yes, Mr. Grantziger.
I know, but they're having a little difficulty with their scenery.
Well, wait till you see it.
I'm trying, Mr. Grantziger.
Keep the tempo up now. Keep it bright.
That's the mother.
I have told her!
Hello, Mr. Grantziger.
- Where is he?
- He's in his office at the top of the theater.
- Hi.
- We're ready now.
It's a privilege to audition, Mr. Grantziger.
You're gonna love us.
"Extra, extra!
"Hey, look at the headlines
Historical news is being made
"Extra, extra!
"They're drawing a red line
Around the biggest scoop of the decade
"A barrel of charm
A fabulous thrill
"The biggest little headline in vaudeville
"Presenting in person
"That 4-foot-8 bundle of dynamite
"Dainty June!"
Hello, everybody. My name is June.
What's yours?
"I have a moo cow, a new cow
"A true cow named Caroline
"She's an extra special friend of mine
"I like everything about her fine
"But if we moved to the city
"Or we settled by the shore
"She'd make the move
"'Cause she loves me more"
Yes, Mr. Grantziger?
Dainty June, would you come out here, please?
Face front, dear.
Profile.
Yes, Mr. Grantziger.
Thank you. That's all.
But we've got a big dramatic finale.
- Sure. But he's seen quite enough.
- Hit it! Hit it!
"Broadway, Broadway!
"We've missed it so
"We're leaving soon and taking June
"To star her in a show
"Bright lights, white lights
"Rhythm and romance
"The train is late
So while we wait
"We're gonna do a little dance"
Straighten that line!
"Broadway, Broadway!
"How great you are
"I'll leave the farm
With all its charm
"To be a Broadway star!
"Bright lights, white lights
"Where the neons glow
"My bag is packed
"I've got my act
- "So all aboard, come on, let's go!
- Let's go!
"'Bye! 'Bye!"
Get this.
It's a train.
Goodbye, Caroline. I'll write to you.
Don't forget to wire.
Goodbye, Caroline.
Goodbye. Don't forget to wire.
Goodbye.
'Bye. Goodbye. Wait!
Stop the train. Stop everything.
I can't go to Broadway with you.
Why not, Dainty June?
Because...
...everything in life that really matters is right here.
What care I for tinsel and glamour...
...when I have friendship and true love?
I'm staying with Caroline.
Yes, Mr. Grantziger?
What?
He liked it.
Well, of course he did.
Yes, sir.
Yes, Mr. Grantziger, if that's what you want.
If you and your tribe'll come up to the office, I'll make out a contract.
You won't be sorry, Mr. Grantziger.
This is gonna make you!
Miss Cratchitt, I believe Mr. Grantziger made a mistake...
...a slight mistake on this contract.
So do I.
- Happy, girls?
- Yes, Mama.
We auditioned for Mr. Grantziger's Tivoli.
This is for Mr. Grantziger's Variety.
- That's right.
- But the Variety is...
...way down on 12th Street.
He'll give you a visa to get there.
Yes?
- I'd like to talk to Mr. Grantziger.
- No!
Now you can't disturb Mr. Grantziger.
Listen...
- I'm through listening. Where is he?
- He's still auditioning down on the stage.
When we're down there he's up here, and when we're up here he's down there.
Mr. Grantziger is a very clever man.
I'll go see if he's down on that stage.
This way?
No. No, Rose. Wait.
- We will wait right here.
- Herbie...
Look, friend, strictly between us, if I were you I'd sign that contract.
There's only one item in that act of yours that the boss likes.
Dainty little June.
He thinks she can be an actress...
...musical comedy, Broadway, that sort of stuff.
And he's right. That's great, isn't it, Rose?
On one condition:
You stay away.
Stay away? I'm her mother.
You said it, I didn't.
What about the act?
One week at the Variety.
After that, what about it? June is the act.
- This must be a private discussion.
- How are Louise and I supposed to live?
You might get a job, dear.
I have a job, dear.
And I do it damn well!
This'd be much better than vaudeville for June, and for us.
- Nothing is better than vaudeville.
- Was better than vaudeville.
- Where's your values?
- Motherhood comes first.
Then you ought to see that this is right.
You'll have June on the stage.
I'll take care of you and Louise and we'll all live like real people.
Rose, this way we can have our cake and eat it, too.
Your cake!
Besides, June wouldn't start all over again, like some beginner.
Ask her, Mama.
Ask her.
Yes. Oh, Mama, yes. Please say yes.
I want to learn, to work.
I'll try so hard to make you proud of me, Mama.
Say yes, Mama.
No.
And I am proud of you, Baby.
You don't need lessons any more than you need Grantziger.
There's no one in show business who doesn't need him.
- Take a good look at this person.
- Rose.
They're so smart in New York.
New York is the center of everything.
New York is the center of New York.
The country's full of people who know people...
...who know what a mother means to her daughter.
Hicks like you don't know.
And Grantziger's a hick! He'll get no place.
Do you hear me, keep still!
Don't you dare answer that phone when I'm yellin' at you.
Did you hear what I said?
They're tryin' to take my baby from me.
Over my dead body they will!
- Come on, we'll go down and tell him.
- Just a minute, Mrs. Hovick!
Mrs. Hovick!
Don't worry, kids...
...I will read her the Declaration of Independence.
Believe me.
It's not your fault, Herbie, it's just the way it is.
Well, I'm gonna try to change the way it is.
Just you wait.
No!
Mama's just talking angry, June.
She won't really spoil anything.
Yes, she will.
I'll never be anything but Baby.
Dainty old Baby June.
Well, aren't ya happy that somebody like Mr. T.T. Grantziger thinks...
...you can be a real actress?
I would be happy...
...if Mama would only see what this means to me.
I'm going to be awfully unhappy remembering how I lost this chance.
Mama made you a vaudeville star and she can do it again.
Vaudeville is gone, Louise.
It's over.
The only show business left is right here on Broadway.
I want to learn to be part of it.
Part of this kind of show business.
You can be anything you want.
You were born for this business.
You're a real stage personality.
You're really wonderful, Louise.
I am? Why?
Because, well, I don't know.
When it comes to the act, you never worry about yourself...
...only for me.
I don't have any talent.
It doesn't really matter.
It's just that Mama would like it better if I did.
Your mother isn't feeling well.
I'm gonna take her back to the hotel.
Don't worry, kids, I'll figure something out.
More than ever I wish
Mama would marry Herbie.
And then we could all be together.
"If Mama was married
We'd live in a house
"As private as private can be
"Just Mama, three ducks, five canaries
"A mouse, two monkeys, one father six turtles and me
"If Mama was married
"If Mama was married
I'd jump in the air
"And give all my toe shoes to you
"I'd get all these hair ribbons
Out of my hair
"And once and for all
I'd get Mama out, too
"If Mama was married
"Mama, get out your white dress
"You've done it before
"Without much success
"Mama, Godspeed and God bless
"We're not keeping score
"What's one more or less
"Oh, Mama, say yes
"And waltz down the aisle while you may
"I'll gladly support you
"I'll even escort you
"And I'll gladly give you away
"Oh, Mama, get married today
"If Mama was married
There wouldn't be any more
"'Let me entertain you
"'Let me make you smile
"'I will do some kicks
"'I will do some tricks'
"'Sing out, Louise!
"'Smile, Baby.'
"Mama, please take our advice
"We aren't the Lunts
"I'm not Fanny Brice
"Mama, we'll buy you the rice
"If only this once
"You wouldn't think twice
"It could be so nice
"If Mama got married to stay
"But Mama gets married
"And married, and married
"And never gets carried away
"Oh, Mama
"Oh, Mama
"Oh, Mama
"Get married today"
How do you like those kids?
They knew darn well I'd marry Herbie at the right time and place.
But 12th Street sure wasn't what I had in mind.
So what if the act is a little shabby right now?
Instead of buyin' longer costumes,
I'm gonna get shorter boys.
And that goes for Tulsa, too.
All that jiggin'.
Say, that's pretty fancy footwork, Tulsa.
Why don't you show it to Mrs. Hovick?
It's just fooling around.
Well, you started fooling around about three months ago.
He had to do something during the layoffs.
I thought maybe you were worried about the act.
Because the way things are pickin' up,
I wouldn't be surprised if you kids got paid.
Things are lookin' so good I might even treat you to an ice-cream soda.
No, thank you.
Chow mein?
Baby Ruth? Butterfinger?
Mama doesn't like us to eat just before a show.
We don't always have to do what your mama likes, do we, Louise?
Herbie?
Oh, nothing.
Tulsa, if you and the boys have any problems just bring them to me, huh?
Sure, Herbie.
You can't blame him for tryin' to act like a big shot.
Everybody knows he's just a stooge.
He is not.
I mean, we all depend on him.
I like Herbie. We all do.
You didn't tell him, did you?
I mean, that you're rehearsing for a team?
How did you know I was?
I saw you practicing last Monday after the matinee. I was up in the flies.
I wouldn't tell anybody, Tulsa, honest.
I'm very secretive, just like you.
Look...
See?
That's what that means in your palm.
And...
...this means that you make up dreams.
Just like me. See?
And what do you make up dreams about?
People.
I do that, too.
Yes, but yours are about a partner for your act.
She's gonna be more than a partner,
I hope.
I mean, I dream...
Well, you know.
What would she have to be like, Tulsa?
A real wonderful dancer and a singer, I guess.
Oh, no. I'm gonna do most of that.
I don't mean I'm gonna hog it all, but...
Well, they always look at the girl on a dance team.
Especially if she's pretty.
Makeup could help, and costumes.
I've got the costumes all figured out.
A blue satin tux for me.
With rhinestone lapels?
You think?
I'll sew 'em on.
Okay. Thanks. Well, you see, I pretend...
Oh, this is a mirror.
I take a comb and comb my hair.
Take a flower...
...smell it...
...and put it in my lapel.
And then I spot the audience.
"Once my clothes were shabby
"Tailors called me 'Cabbie'
"So I took a vow
"Said, 'This bum'll be Beau Brummel'
"Now I'm smooth and snappy
"Now my tailor's happy
"I'm the cat's meow
"My wardrobe is a wow!
"Paris silk
"Harrod's tweed
"There's only one thing I need
"Got my tweed pressed
"Got my best vest
"All I need now
"Is the girl
"Got my striped tie
"Got my hopes high
"Got the time and the place
And I got rhythm
"Now all I need's a girl to go with 'em
"If she'll just appear
"We'll take this big town for a whirl
"And if she'll say
'My darling, I'm yours'
"I'll throw away my striped tie
"And my best pressed tweed
"All I really need is the girl"
I start easy, you see.
Now I'm more debonair.
Break.
And I sell it here.
I start this step, see.
And then I build it.
And now I double it.
She appears all in white.
I take her hand...
...and I kiss it.
And lead her on the floor.
This step is good for the costume.
Astaire bit.
"Now we waltz
"Strings come in"
And I lift her.
Again.
Once more.
And now the tempo changes...
...and all the lights come up...
...and I build for the finale.
Louise, that's it. Over here.
Give me your hand.
Now follow me.
That's it, Louise. Now do it faster.
That's it. Now the front.
Do it again.
Do it again.
Turn.
Louise.
So okay, they keep on makin' garages out of vaudeville houses...
...and bowling alleys and stuff like that.
But kill vaudeville?
Did you ever hear such banana oil?
There was still Omaha.
So we were a smash, like usual.
And then made tracks for a sensational engagement in Dallas.
As we waited for the train I was high.
Just had a feelin' everything was gonna be dipsy-doodle.
You know how you are sometimes.
There'sjust somethin' in the air.
Have you guys seen Louise and June?
Where's Jerry and Joe?
Why's everyone late?
We'd like to talk to you.
Let me find out whether the train's on time.
Is the southbound train on schedule?
I wouldn't say it is and I wouldn't say it ain't.
- I will say you got time for a bowl of chili.
- Thanks. We have a short wait.
- Why don't you get a cup of java?
- We ain't goin' to Dallas, we're quitting.
You've been threatening that for years.
- No, this is the truth.
- We're not kidding.
Tell her, Herbie.
The boys are kind of unhappy.
Not serious. I'll straighten it out.
- You can't straighten it out.
- Mrs. Hovick, we're finished.
We want our railroad tickets.
We're going in the other direction.
- You're walkin' out on the act?
- They don't mean anything of the kind.
They're just kids and every once in a while they get upset.
When they get upset, I get upset.
And I don't like it.
Shut your traps.
Now where are June and Louise?
I shouldn't have let 'em go to the movies.
They're crazy about John Gilbert.
I couldn't refuse.
Mrs. Hovick, you've got to believe us.
It's nothing personal, but we're quitting the act.
I told you in Klamath Falls
I didn't want boys.
They're troublemakers.
But we got boys, Rose.
Just let me talk to them, will you?
Fellas, Angie, I've always been your friend, haven't I? So give a listen.
Now don't lower yourself to argue, Herbie.
These rats wanna quit the act, let 'em quit.
They want their railroad tickets, give 'em bus tickets.
- What's keepin' the girls?
- We got lots of time.
Fellas, I know we've had a couple of layoffs in the past...
It isn't that, Herbie. We're too old.
Would you be too old if we could increase your salary?
Increase what salary?
- Herbie's been payin' us...
- Moron!
How long will it take you to get used to me, Rose?
Button your coat.
Button your coat.
Ingrates! You take the bread out of that man's mouth and spit it in his face.
As the good Lord says,
"Good riddance to bad rubbish."
Give 'em the tickets.
They were sluffin' the act anyway.
Okay. Okay.
Thanks, Herbie. We'd also like Joe's ticket.
Joe's leaving, too?
That leaves us just with Jerry.
Well, not exactly. Jerry's already gone.
On his own.
Where you been?
Where's the baby? You didn't let her stay for the second show?
- No, we didn't go to the show.
- What?
I've been looking for the baby all over the place.
I finally went to the hotel and the room clerk gave me this note for you.
- What's she writing me for?
- I don't know.
- What's in it?
- I'll read it to you.
I can read my own letters, thank you.
"Mama...
"...l've had a dream. Me.
"My dream was like a nightmare.
"I dreamed I was a very old lady, but I was still Dainty June...
"...still doin' the same old act.
"I was so ashamed of myself,
I ran away, Mama...
"...from the act, from you, from your dreams...
"...because they only made you happy.
"And if I want a dream of my own, my very own, I have to be like you, Mama.
"I have to fight for it.
"I started toward my dream three weeks ago in between shows.
"I married Jerry.
"Please don't worry about me, Mama.
"Maybe I'm enough like you to make my dream come true...
"...to grow up and be a real actress.
"I'll always love you and Louise, Mama...
"...and I'll always be grateful to Herbie.
"June."
When did they leave?
Did she tell you where they were going?
No. Nothing, honest.
I'll call the cops. They'll find 'em, Rose, and bring 'em back. Don't you worry.
You shouldn't call the cops.
They'll scare June.
It's gotta be against the law for a 13-year-old to be marryin'.
Rose, she must have lied about her age.
I'm gonna call the police.
I'd better get her ammonia.
I think it's in her valise.
Can I use your phone?
I've gotta call the police.
This little girl, underage, who married a boy...
- How old are they, mister?
- The girl's 13. The boy is 17, 18.
There's nothing illegal about that in this state.
It's legal for a girl of 12 and legal for a boy at 16.
This is pioneer country and we've never changed the law.
I still want to call the cops.
Come on in.
You won't hear any different from them than me.
Can we have the tickets now?
We gotta get movin'.
Police department.
- I fixed up an act of my own...
- Get moving.
Don't be sore, Herbie.
It ain't our fault the act's washed up.
Goodbye, Herbie.
Hey, fellas...
...good luck.
- Thanks, Herbie.
- Thanks. Good luck to you, too, Herbie.
Good luck, Louise.
Come on, Yonkers.
Goodbye, Louise.
Goodbye?
You mean you're all going away?
Yeah, all of us. Gee, I'm sick about it, but I gotta think of my future.
Why didn't you tell me, Tulsa?
Like you once said, Louise, it's in my palm.
I keep secrets the way you do.
Listen, I would've loved June to be my partner.
I know.
You'll find another one.
What will you do?
I don't know.
Well, I hope we run into each other again.
Maybe we'll even play on the same bill.
Yeah. Maybe.
You're a great girl.
You're the cat's whiskers.
That's what we all say.
You're just like one of the boys.
Yeah, that's me all right.
"One of the boys."
Thanks, Tulsa.
I just talked to the authorities.
There's no way we can get June back.
What're we gonna do?
Rose.
Rose. Honey, listen.
I'm still in the candy business.
It's steady, 52 weeks a year, every year.
I'll be a district manager.
We can stay put, have a home of our own.
Louise can go to school.
Rose?
Rose, you still got Herbie.
You can marry me and I promise you won't have one single worry...
...for the rest of your life.
Don't you want that?
Yes. Oh, Mama, say yes.
Herbie.
You read palms, I read minds. It's okay.
It's all gonna be fine now, honey.
Everything happens for the best.
Okay, so the act is finished.
But you and me and our daughter...
...we're gonna have a home of our own.
We even got a cow for the backyard.
We're gonna be the best damned homebodies you ever saw.
The boys walked because they think the act's finished.
They think we're nothin'.
Well, let 'em walk. Let 'em all walk.
I don't need any of 'em.
They needed me.
I'm used to people walkin' out.
When my own mother did it,
I cried for a week. Your father did it.
Then the man I married after him did it.
Well, this time I'm not cryin'.
Because I don't need any of 'em.
I'm the electricity.
I was always the electricity.
Who do you think made the act?
I made it! And I can make it again.
And I will, I swear I will.
This time I'm gonna do it for you.
This time I'm gonna make you a star, baby.
We're gonna have all new costumes, all new people, all new everything.
It's like bein' born all over again.
We got everything ahead of us.
Take a look at our new star.
Look at her, Herbie. Look at her.
You're right.
This is today and everything else is yesterday's mashed potatoes.
Finished? Why, we're just beginning.
And this time nothing's gonna stop us.
"I had a dream
"A dream about you, baby
"It's gonna come true, baby
"They think that we're through
"But, baby
"You'll be swell, you'll be great
"Gonna have the whole world on a plate
"Startin' here, startin' now
"Honey, everything's comin' up roses
"Clear the decks, clear the tracks
"You got nothin' to do but relax
"Blow a kiss, take a bow
"Honey, everything's comin' up roses
"Now's your inning
"Stand the world on its ear
"Set it spinning
"That'll be just the beginning
"Curtain up, light the lights
"You've got nothin' to hit but the heights
"You'll be swell, you'll be great
"I can tell, just you wait
"That lucky star I talk about is due
"Honey, everything's comin' up roses
"For me and for you
"You can do it
"All you need is a hand
"We can do it
"Mama is gonna see to it!
"Curtain up, light the lights
"We got nothin' to hit but the heights
"I can tell, wait and see
"There's the bell, follow me
"And nothin's gonna stop us till we're through
"Honey, everything's coming up roses and daffodils
"Everything's comin' up sunshine and Santa Claus
"Everything's gonna be bright lights and lollipops
"Everything's comin' up roses
"For me and for you!"
No, no, no.
That's not right.
Sing out, Louise, sing out.
Let Mr. Ziegfeld hear you.
I got it! I got it!
I had another dream.
Instead of boys we'll use girls.
And you know the cow in the act?
It's not gonna be a cow anymore.
It's gonna be a bull.
So, it's gonna be a bull.
It's a good idea.
And you're gonna be the bullfighter.
And you know what?
We're callin' the act
Madame Rose's Toreadorables.
All we need is the girls.
Yes, Mother.
All we need is the girls.
How're we gonna get 'em?
We'll get 'em...
...Uncle Jocko.
Herbie did the Uncle Jocko bit again and got us six girls for the act, semi-talented.
I didn't like the dough goin' out for hotels, so I discovered the Army and Navy stores.
Surplus tents, for instance.
Ready, Louise?
Yes, Mama.
- Ready, girls?
- Yes, Madam Rose.
Remember, you mustn't be discouraged by the past.
You're artists of the theater.
Madam Rose's Toreadorables.
"Extra, extra!
"Hey, look at the headlines
Historical news is being made"
Sing out!
"Extra, extra!
"They're drawing a red line
Around the biggest scoop of the decade
"In the decade
"A barrel of charm
A fabulous thrill
"The biggest little headline in vaudeville
"Presenting in person
- "That 5-foot-3 bundle of dynamite"
- Sell it! Sell it, girls!
"Senorita Louise"
Well, come on, Louise, come on!
Olé, everybody! My name's Louise.
What's yours?
Well, it's comin' along.
Mama...
...l'm just no good at it.
Now don't be silly.
All right, girls, let's try the finish.
They'll forgive you anything if you've got a strong finish.
You're late. Now, girls, let's make it stirring!
Pick up your feet, Louise! Pick 'em up!
Up, up!
I guess they're tired.
All right, girls, over to your tents.
Get ready for bed.
- Good night, Louise.
- Good night, Mama.
- But it's still light, Madam Rose.
- Don't argue, go to bed.
And don't forget to write your mothers...
...for money.
How'd it go in town?
Not even a benefit.
They're too un-American down here, that's what.
We better talk about goin' back up north as soon as I tell the girls a bedtime story.
Why do you make Louise wear that wig in the act?
It makes her look more like...
...a star.
Why do you keep the cow?
Herbie, if that cow goes, I go.
The act can be fixed.
If I was doin' it for her sister
I'd have it all set.
But you're not.
And I'm not my sister.
She doesn't expect you to be.
Mama...
...I love you so much and I've tried hard as I could...
...but the act is rotten and I'm rotten in it.
How do you like that? Typical of a kid.
Mama, I've been wanting to say this...
- Always impatient.
- Mama...
- A few break-in dates don't go so good...
- I'm not a blonde.
And I'm not my sister, and I just can't do what she did.
She's not asking you to.
Maybe you want show business...
Maybe? Why, it's our whole lives!
It's what we've been working for since you were born.
Honey, maybe I have been on the wrong track about your material...
...but I'll find out what you do best.
The good Lord says, "You gotta take the rough with the smooth."
And you're lucky. You were born lucky, because you're not alone, see?
- Right, Herbie?
- Right.
You know, we could get a nice refund on this if we'd ever paid for it.
How about getting a gallon of peroxide and a carton of toothbrushes?
What for, Herbie?
Make 'em all blondes.
I was only jokin'.
So was I, honey.
But why not do it?
- Louise, they're just children.
- They're young girls, Mama.
As blondes they could be pretty young girls.
With some imagination it might work.
It'd jazz up the act, make it easier to sell.
We could call it,
Madam Rose and her Blonde Babies.
Baby Blondes.
No, nothing with babies.
- Hollywood Blondes.
- Yes!
All blondes except you,
'cause you're the star.
If I'm the star...
...then it should be
Louise and Her Hollywood Blondes.
Rose Louise and her Hollywood Blondes!
Okay.
Well, I told you everything would come up lollipops.
Herbie got us a two-week date.
And we were paid minimum plus, guaranteed in advance...
...at the Wichita Opera House.
We were on our way up again.
Nothin' can stop Rose. Nothin'.
Okay, okay. Kill the traveler.
That's right, trim it. Okay.
That's right.
It's a real live theater!
With a real live stage!
Don't you love it?
Louise, look!
A real live theater.
Just like opening day rehearsals used to be.
Mama's gonna love it.
- Will you kill them floods?
- Will you shut your face?
- She isn't gonna love that.
- Or that!
Slave, my fiddle.
What the hay?
What kind of an act is that?
Yeah?
Okay, jailbait, you the Hollywood Blondes?
- Yes. I'm...
- You're late.
- Our car broke down and...
- Skip it.
Some of you can use that dressing room.
The rest of you, over there.
The first one you share with Tessie Tura, the Texas Twirler.
The second with Mazeppa,
Revolutions in Dance.
Now shake it up, will you?
So...
...you're the act that's supposed to keep the cops out, huh?
Boy, you must be lousy.
It's a real live theater, all right.
He reminds me of my brother.
Don't start sniveling.
Take the cow and anything else you can carry into the first dressing room.
Marjorie May, take the other girls into that second room and start unpacking.
I want to go home.
Look at this!
That Tessie Tura must be a very fancy lady.
She must also be a pig.
Louise!
In here, Mama.
Let me help you.
Baby, we're back in the theater.
We're back in a real live theater.
I really think we ought to talk to Herbie.
He went up front to check on our billing.
Good morning. Good morning, I...
It ain't weighted right.
It scratches the devil out of me and it just don't bump when I do.
Maybe there's somethin' wrong with your bumper.
Big joke!
I'm out there bumpin' my brains off with no action and she's bein' witty.
Hey, you with the neck.
I paid six bucks for that costume.
Now back where you found it.
Yes, ma'am.
Get the bags, get the cow, get the props!
You don't know what kind of theater this is.
Yes, I do. It's a house of burlesque.
A house of burlesque.
And you know what that is? Filth!
- When your friend Herbie shows his face...
- I'm sure he didn't know.
Not much, he didn't. Agnes!
He got the booking over the telephone.
We were all so happy.
My name is Amanda.
Your name is Agnes and I want you and the others out of here in two seconds.
- But, Madam Rose...
- March! March! Go!
Wait a minute.
Wait in the other dressing room.
You take the rear end of the cow,
I'll take the front.
And what bags we can't carry, your friend
Herbie can pick up and carry himself.
Listen to me. Just because you think
Herbie can do no wrong...
- This has nothing to do with him.
- You don't know what burlesque is.
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't!
No daughter of mine will work in a burlesque house.
And no daughter of any woman I know.
Where are we gonna work?
Vaudevillians won't even live in the same hotel as burlesque people.
Mama, how much money do we have?
Including what's left of their allowances, how much money do we have?
Somethin' will turn up.
It has turned up and this is it!
Mama, we're flat broke.
We've gotta take this job.
Even if you wanted to quit and go home, we'd have to take it.
I had a dream.
- Mama...
- You're gonna like this one.
I had it over a week ago, only I didn't want to tell you.
The cow came into my room.
But she wasn't dancin', smilin' this time.
She was wheezin' and kind of sad-like.
She came over to my bed and looked at me, and she said:
"Rose, move over."
I'm sorry, Mama.
Why? She didn't ask you to move over.
I mean, I'm sorry I'm not good enough in the act.
It's the act that isn't good enough, baby...
...or somethin'.
Rose!
In here.
Look, I didn't know. Louise.
Rose, I didn't know, believe me.
I do, honey.
Oh, what's the difference?
The money is good.
It's only two weeks and maybe by that time somethin' will turn up. Right?
Right!
You're a nice girl, Rose. Thank you.
- That's show business.
- One good thing: I bet we get top billing.
Actually, you see, they had us kinda lost in the middle.
I thought last would be better, so that it reads:
"And Rose Louise and Her Hollywood Blondes."
They'll use plenty of pictures and put a box around it.
Forget the box, Herbie, and the pictures.
You don't know what they say in the business, but Herbie does.
When a vaudeville act plays burlesque it means it's all washed up.
Herbie, nothin' is gonna turn up for us, is it?
No.
It is a pretty rotten act.
Honey, it's not the act.
It's like I been tellin' you, vaudeville is dead, stone-cold dead!
- We sure tried though, didn't we?
- We sure did.
Right?
Right.
Herbie.
I better get the cues ready.
Hey, Rose Louise, where's your music?
And your light cues?
I'll be right with you.
- You Rose Louise?
- Yeah, I'm Rose Louise.
Oh, Herbie.
Things are lookin' up.
I got a show to open, Rose Louise, so move your butt.
Now listen, you little punk!
For the next two weeks you're gonna speak like a Sunday school teacher.
You got something in this theater you probably never saw before: A lady.
Take a look.
That is a lady.
And that is also a lady.
And every girl in this act is a lady and don't you forget it. Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Now get out there on that stage and I'll give you the cues when I'm ready.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me...
...ma'am.
Sir, won't you give me your protection?
I'm a lady, too.
Just let me by, lady, and there won't be any casualties.
Say, you're cute.
How about you and me goin' for a ride after the show?
All my seats are reserved.
The thing worked, thanks to you.
- Well, if you ladies will excuse me.
- We're very busy.
- In my dressing room?
- In your dress...
You heard me.
And I don't like sharin' it any more than you do.
Particularly with a troupe from the Virgin Islands.
Now don't start up on us, understand?
We're headliners from the Orpheum Circuit.
We were booked into this theater by mistake.
Weren't we all?
Say, who made that?
I did. I make all our costumes.
My, look at them ladylike little stitches.
That miserable broad who's been makin' my gowns must be usin' a fish hook.
What do you pay her?
- $25 a gown and I provide the material.
- She's new in the business.
- Are you her mother?
- Yes.
I'll get the material after the matinee.
It's a deal. Louise, where's your toreador costume?
The girls must have it in the other dressing room with them.
Heaven knows what else they've got in their dressing room.
From the way that dame walks...
...she would've made a real good stripper in her day.
Tessie...
Tessie, I'm short a talking woman.
Tough. "T, U, F." Tough.
The new comic won't use a chorus girl.
Then let him use Mazeppa.
Everybody else has.
Now you know Mazeppa's got her Gladiator Ballet just before his spot.
Let them cut the ballet. It stinks anyway.
Be a sport. I'm in a bind.
You're always in a bind in this flea-bitten trap.
I'm a strip woman, slob.
I don't do no scenes. Now blow.
Have you ever heard of a first-class strip woman playin' scenes?
When you play stock in a dump like this,
I guess you gotta expect to get insulted.
The work is steady, isn't it?
But you bring a new star in for each show, don't ya?
Tessie, it's just a few lines.
Fat boy, save your bad breath.
- I'll give you $10 extra.
- No.
I can read lines.
Who are you?
Rose Louise, of Rose Louise and Her Hollywood Blondes.
Just a minute. What kind of lines?
- You in her act?
- Not exactly.
- Shut up! How are your legs?
- Great! And I'll learn her the scenes.
Okay, $10.
It's money, Mama.
What kind of lines will she read out on that stage?
The same burlesque junk that's been said since the year 1.
- Say, where've you been all your life?
- Playin' vaudeville.
Where? In the Louvre?
You name any town in the United States and we've played it.
My grandpa says we've covered the country like gypsies.
Well, you may be a gypsy, Rose Louise, but you're...
Say, that ain't a bad name if you ever take up strippin'.
She won't.
No, but you'll let her feed lines to a bum comic...
...for a lousy $10 a week.
That's trainin'. She's gonna be a headliner.
This is only temporary.
Just as soon as we finish here she's goin' right back to vaudeville.
I better talk to Herbie about this.
We never do anything without consulting our artists' representative.
I'd like to consult your artists' representative.
That's a man.
He and Mama are gonna be married.
She better grab him or she's dumber than she looks.
Don't you start calling my mother dumb.
She's a lot smarter than any of you.
Listen, we gotta share a dressing room.
Let's smoke a peace pipe, okay?
I'm willing.
I hope so.
Sharin' a dressing room is like sleepin' together, and if you don't get along...
I'll thank you not to give the boss any notion that I would ever play scenes.
And one more disparaging remark about my ballet...
...will find this bugle right in your eye.
Please!
There's a lady present.
Where?
Open your eyes instead of your mouth.
Gypsy, meet Miss Mazeppa, Miss Electra.
Say, you're even younger than I was when I started strippin'.
I'm not gonna strip.
Somethin' wrong with strippin'?
No, I just meant I don't have any talent.
You think they have?
I, myself, of course, was a ballerina.
But take it from me, to be a stripper all you need to have is no talent.
You'll pardon me...
...but to have no talent is not enough.
What you need to have is an idea that makes your strip special.

Herbie.
- Hello, Herbie.
- Hello, Rose.
You win.
We've come to the end.
Guess we'd better make some new plans.
How about marryin' me?
Sure. Sure!
Sure.
I love you, you know.
Yeah, I do.
Let's do it today.
Not while we're still in burlesque.
- The day we close.
- It's a deal.
Oh, Herbie.
I do, I do!
So do I, Rose.
Come in.
I'll bet you thought I forgot, huh?
Not Herbie!
I remember everything, including the wedding bouquet, the finest in Wichita.
Thanks, Herbie.
They're knockouts, aren't they?
They sure are knockouts, Herbie.
Hey, stop packing and talk to me!
Gosh, this is the great day!
I can't help it. I'm nervous.
Why aren't you?
- I've never been so nervous.
- You've never been married before.
You've never been married before like you'll be married this time.
She's a little sad, too.
You know, about the girls.
Rose, honey, I know what you're feelin'.
It ain't easy to give this up after all these years, but you'll never regret it.
I ought to shut up, but I can't help it.
I'm finally getting everything
I ever wanted.
Including a fancy ceremony and bridesmaids.
What the minister will say when he sees all that Hollywood blonde hair...
...I don't know. I don't know.
Let's hope he's colorblind.
What difference does it make?
All he has to ask in exactly one hour is:
"Do you, Rose, take him, Herbie?"
And you know what I'm gonna answer?
"I, Rose, take you, Herbie."
Thank you.
- I better get the bags in the car.
- I don't know why I stay in this business!
- If it ain't one headache, it's another!
- They'll hear you out front.
It's my theater, ain't it?
Last week, no talkin' woman.
The week before, no second banana.
If you knew that crazy broad wasn't here why'd you start the performance?
She don't go on till next to closin'.
She said she was only goin' to the drugstore.
- What'd they arrest her for?
- Shoplifting.
Cut the spot.
Rose, can we invite the minister for a drink afterwards?
It's the star strip!
Cut it!
Mama, we could hang the cow's head over the mantelpiece.
They'll yell "murder" if it's the same bags they've seen the last eight weeks.
- The star's the novelty.
- Pastey, what do you expect me to do?
- Let you strip?
- No.
- My daughter can do it.
- What?
- Rose Louise.
- Since when?
Since she's seen how easy it is.
- She didn't look bad in the scenes.
- She'll look great when I fix her up!
- What's the gimmick?
- She's young and you got any better ideas?
She'd better get ready now.
It's the star spot.
- That means star salary.
- If we keep her.
You will. She's gonna be wonderful.
I knew somethin' would turn up.
Where's the dress you were making for Tessie?
It'll work perfect for you.
Get into your makeup.
There isn't much time.
Silly, you aren't really gonna strip.
All you're gonna do is walk around the stage in time to the music...
...and drop a shoulder strap at the end.
You're a lady, like Herbie says.
You'll parade so grand they'll think it's a favor if you even show 'em your knee.
Louise, it's the star spot.
I always promised my daughter we'd be a star.
Not like this.
You can't do it, Rose.
Herbie, it's all right to walk out when they want ya...
...but we can't walk out when after all these years we're still a flop.
That's quittin'.
We can't quit because we're still a flop.
Please, do this. Then we can leave proud because we made it.
Maybe only in burlesque.
Maybe only in second-rate burlesque at that, but...
Let's walk away a star.
Baby.
No time to finish that dress.
I'll get everything ready.
Get the junk off this dress, the Tessie trim.
Herbie, see what the house is like.
Sure.
Sure, why not?
Didn't I always tell you, you were born lucky, Louise?
Not too much makeup, baby.
Young and girlish, pure.
Don't smear that junk on your face the way the others do!
Just leave your mouth the way the good Lord made it.
Not too much rouge. No beauty marks.
You'll be a lady: Grand, elegant, with a classy ladylike walk.
Ye gods, shoes!
We can use the black ones.
The old ones that we borrowed from Tessie.
They'll have to do.
If they're too big, stuff 'em with paper.
Your hair's all wrong. You can't just let it hang there like spaghetti.
Get it up, dear! And puff it out on top.
It's gotta be classy.
Thank God the Lord gave us good color and that you washed it this morning.
Do you think we should use a few feathers in it?
No, that's what they all do. Jewelry!
No, let Tessie and the others wear all this vulgar junk. Come in.
- She ready?
- She'll be there.
She's on in seven minutes.
She'll be there. Come on, Louise.
Get in the dress.
Come dear, come.
You're gonna be just wonderful, darling.
Go along, dear. Here's your dress.
Keep a lot of pins in your hair.
Get it tight so it won't fall down.
- Will you get out of here!
- Six and a half minutes.
I know, I know.
Say, whose are these?
My wedding present from Tessie.
Good for a lady. She can wear 'em.
Now what else? Music. Music.
Spanish. Military. Cow.
Maybe she can do the Let Me Entertain You number.
Baby, you can do the Let me Entertain You number.
I'll mark it for the conductor to repeat two choruses slow.
No, two and a half. And sing out, Louise!
Just walk and dip.
Remember, you're a lady.
Make 'em beg for more and then don't give it to 'em.
Did I forget anything?
Is that you, honey? How is the audience?
It don't matter.
The car is outside and the girls are in it.
I'm just gonna put these bags in the car and then we're going.
You, Louise and me, we're gonna get married.
- This is our farewell to show business.
- Herbie, don't talk dumb.
Two performances, a lot of dollars, and she'll always remember she was a star.
You want your daughter to take off her clothes in front of a lot of hooting savages?
You really want her to be ogled and leered at?
When a star's onstage there's an invisible wall...
...between her and the audience.
She's an artist.
An artist can keep her audience away and leave them smiling.
Listen, I'm getting sick to my stomach again.
Herbie, don't you see that I have to do this?
No, I don't see that you have to do this!
All I see is what I have to do.
- I'm leaving.
- I apologize.
No, let me!
For my resemblance to a mouse.
No, a worm!
The way I've crawled after you.
No more, Rose. No more, I won't!
I wanted to crawl away from you because my stomach turned over...
...to think of coming back to tell you we're finished!
- Tell me after we're married.
- We'll never be.
- We certainly are.
- No, no! No, never!
Not even if you got down on your knees and begged.
Now look, I still love you, Rose.
But all the vows from here to doomsday couldn't make you a wife.
I want a wife, Rose!
I'm gonna be a man if it kills me.
- So you're killin' me.
- Nobody can kill you.
You think I got a bulletproof vest?
You're jealous, that's what you are.
Of my girls, 'cause they're always first.
They always did and they always will.
And Louise is gonna be a star!
She's gonna be a star if it kills you and her.
She's gonna be a star someplace!
While she's gonna be a star, where are you gonna be?
Where will you be when she gets married?
She won't get married for years.
She's just a baby.
Sure.
- Anyway, her career'll always come first.
- That's right.
That is right.
Herbie...
Why does everybody walk out?
Maybe Louise won't.
Don't leave, Herbie.
I need you.
What for?
A million things.
Just one would be better.
Goodbye, honey.
Be a good girl.
You go to the devil!
Get her music to the conductor...
...and you better stand by me for the light cues.
I just hope you know what you're doin'.
"Lucky
"You're a man who likes children
"That's an important sign
"Lucky
"I'm a woman with children
"Funny
"Small and funny"
I'll get the music to the leader.
Remember...
...you're a lady.
And you are going to be a star!
Mama...
...l'm pretty.
I'm a pretty girl, Mama.
Come on, come on.
You look beautiful.
- Just for luck, honey.
- Are you nervous, baby?
- What?
- I said, "Are you nervous?"
No, Mother.
Wichita's one and only burlesque theater presents:
Mama!
Gypsy Rose Lee!
Her name's Louise.
It ain't anymore. Go on, kid.
"Let me entertain you
"Let me make you smile"
Sing out, Louise!
Sing out!
"Let me do a few tricks
"Some old and then some new tricks
"I'm very versatile
"And if you're real good
"I'll make you feel good
"I want your spirits to climb
"So let me entertain you
"And we'll have a real good time
Yes, sir!
"We'll have a real good time"
Don't just walk, do something!
Dip! Just dip!
Take somethin' off!
"Let me entertain you"
A glove! Give 'em a glove!
"And we'll have a real good time. Yes, sir!
"We'll have...
"...a real good time!"
The Alhambra Theater of Detroit is happy to present...
...that lovely newcomer,
Miss Gypsy Rose Lee!
Philadelphia's Diamond Burlesque takes pleasure in presenting...
...that lovely new star...
...Miss Gypsy Rose Lee.
Hello everybody. My name's Gypsy.
What's yours?
Minsky's world famous burlesque takes great pride and pleasure...
...in presenting the queen of the striptease...
...the incomparable Miss Gypsy Rose Lee...
...in our salute to the new year.
"Let me entertain you
"Let me make you smile
"Let me entertain you
"We'll have a real good
"And if you're real good
"I'll make you feel good
"I want your spirits to climb
"Let me entertain you

"We'll have...
"...a real good time!"
- Good evening, Mrs. Hovick.
- Good evening.
Glad to see you.
If you are, you're the only one.
Who put that sign up on the blackboard?
I do not know, madame.
I think it was probably a pleasantry.
I don't think it's a very pleasant pleasantry.
A cow! What's that for?
That's a souvenir to remind some people where they came from...
...which it wouldn't do any harm.
Renee, that comes down.
You need something to remind you your goal was to be a great actress...
...not a cheap stripper.
My sister's the actress, Mother.
And I'm not a cheap stripper.
I'm the highest paid in the business.
You won't be ready for vaudeville when it comes back.
No, I'll be dead.
- Renee, would you take this tray, please?
- I'll do it.
Mother, please. And bring my press agent in as soon as he comes.
Oui, madame.
Since when do you fix your face before you have your bath?
A photographer is coming.
Where's he going to photograph you, in the tub?
Eventually.
Louise!
Mother, it's for a very chic fashion magazine.
Do you think I oughta freshen up?
They only want me in the tub.
I'll get it.
Hello.
Hello.
No, it's...
...difficult right now.
I'm not leaving.
Let's meet at the party.
Yes.
Yes, I promise.
A bientôt.
A bien what?
I guess I am being a little much...
...but, Mama, I love it.
Who's givin' the party?
Some friends.
In the old days, I used to be asked first.
I wouldn't go even if I did have somethin' to wear.
I got more important things to do.
Like thinkin' up an idea for a new strip for us.
We're still stuck with that wind machine you bought to blow my clothes off.
Actually, I'm putting in a new number on Saturday.
What is it?
You'll see.
I'll see!
Mama, let me surprise you.
You're just one big surprise after another these days, aren't you?
We'd better go shopping tomorrow for the material for your dress.
I have a French lesson tomorrow.
Well, I'll go alone.
You got any color in mind?
Mother, I've already started to make the dress.
Well, I'll run your bath for you.
Mama, you don't have to.
That's what I have a maid for.
Let me do somethin', damn it!
What, Mother?
A million things. I'm not a baby.
Neither am I!
Don't take that tone with me, young lady.
- Your sister...
- I am not my sister!
- You're not Louise either!
- Neither are you!
Yes, I am! More than you,
Miss Gypsy Rose Lee...
...with your maids and press agents and fancy friends with their fancy parties.
Your loudmouth mother isn't invited to those high-tone parties. They laugh at her.
- They don't!
- They do.
Don't think I don't know that's one reason you don't want me backstage.
So I won't hear 'em laugh.
It's them you ought to keep out, not me!
Because they're laughin' at you, too.
The burlesque queen who speaks lousy French...
...and reads book reviews like they was books!
Turn it off, Mother!
You know what you are to them?
A circus freak.
This year's novelty act.
And when the bill is changed you'll...
I said, turn it off!
Nobody laughs at me!
Because I laugh first. At me!
Me, from Seattle! Me, with no education.
Me, with no talent, as you kept reminding me my whole life!
Well, Mama, look at me now.
I'm a star!
Look! Look how I live!
Look at my friends!
Look where I'm going!
I'm not staying in burlesque!
I'm moving, maybe up, maybe down!
But wherever it is, I'm enjoying it.
I'm having the time of my life!
Because for the first time, it is my life!
And I love it. I love every second of it!
And I'll be damned if you're gonna take it away from me!
I am Gypsy Rose Lee!
And I love her!
And if you don't, you can just clear out now!
Your press agent is here with the photographer.
All right, tell him I'll be ready in a minute.
Mama, we can't go shouting seven performances of this a week.
The whole family shouts.
It comes from our living so near the railroad tracks.
- I'm getting an ulcer.
- You think I'm not?
Yes, I think you're not!
If you want an ulcer, get one of your own,
'cause you can't have mine!
Let's forget it.
No, let's finish it.
I should go feed Chowsie.
Mama, you fought your whole life.
I wish you could just relax now.
- You need more mascara on your left eye.
- Mama, you've got to let go of me!
Let go?
I'll give you anything you want.
You need me.
A house, a farm, a school.
A dramatic school for kids.
You were always great with kids.
I'm a pro.
I'm not an old work horse you can turn out to pasture...
...just because you think you're riding high on your own.
Mama, no kid does it all on his own.
I'm not a kid anymore.
And from now on, even if I flop...
...I flop on my own.
Hey, Gyp, what do you say?
"So long, Rose." That's what she says.
"Don't slam the door as you leave."
Hi, Rose. Gyps, baby, may I present
Monsieur Bougeron-Cochet.
- Enchantée, monsieur.
- Enchanté, mademoiselle.
Excusez-moi.
Let's make with the oiseau, kiddies.
One before you take the plunge, Gyps.
Get ready now.
All right, miss, but just one thing I wanna know.
All the pushing and workin' and fenaglin'...
...all the scrimpin' and the schemin' and lyin' awake nights figurin':
How do we get from one town to the next?
How do we all eat on a buck?
How do I make an act out of nothin'?
What did I do it for?
You said I fought all my life.
I fought all your life.
So now, tell me, what did I do it for?
I thought you did it for me, Mama.
Come on smile, Gyps.
Show us your talent.
That's it.
"I thought you did it for me, Mama."
"I thought you did it for me, Mama."
I thought you made a no-talent ox into a star because...
...you like doin' things the hard way, Mama.
And you have no talent.
Not what I call talent,
Miss Gypsy Rose Lee.
I made you.
I made you!
And you wanna know why?
You wanna know what I did it for?
Because I was born too soon and started too late, that's why.
What I got in me...
I could've been better than any of you.
What I got in me...
...what I've been holdin' down inside of me...
...if I ever let it go...
...there wouldn't have been signs big enough.
There wouldn't have been lights bright enough.
Here she is, boys!
Here she is, world!
Here's Rose!
"Curtain up
"Light the lights
"Play it, boys
"You either got it or you ain't
"And, boys, I got it
"You like it?
"Well, I got it
"Some people got it and make it pay
"Some people can't even give it away
"This people's got it
"And this people's spreadin' it around
"You either have it, or you've had it"
Hello, everybody.
My name's Rose. What's yours?
How do you like them egg rolls,
Mr. Goldstone?
"Hold your hats and hallelujah
Mama's gonna show it to you
"Ready or not
Here comes Mama
"Mama's talkin' loud
Mama's doin' fine
"Mama's gettin' hot
Mama's goin' strong
"Mama's movin' on
Mama's all alone
"Mama doesn't care
Mama's lettin' loose
"Mama's got the stuff
Mama's lettin' go
"Mama, Mama
"Mama's got the stuff
Mama's gotta move
"Mama's gotta go
"Mama, Mama
"Mama's gotta let go
"Why did I do it?
"What did it get me?
"Scrapbooks full of me in the background
"Give 'em love and what does it get you?
"What does it get you?
One quick look as each of 'em leaves you
"All your life and what does it get you?
"Thanks a lot
And out with the garbage
"They take bows
And you're battin' zero
"I had a dream
"I dreamed it for you, June
"It wasn't for me, Herbie
"And if it wasn't for me
"Just where would you be
"Miss Gypsy Rose Lee?
"Well, someone tell me
When is it my turn?
"Don't I get a dream for myself?
"Startin' now, it's gonna be my turn
"Gangway, world,
Get off of my runway
"Startin' now, I bat a thousand
"This time, boys, I'm takin' the bows
"And everything's comin' up Rose
"Everything's comin' up roses
"Everything's comin' up roses
"This time for me
"For me
"For me"
Just tryin' out a few ideas
I thought you might wanna use.
You'd really have been something, Mother.
Think so?
If you had had someone to push you like I did.
If I could have been, I would have been.
That's show business.
About that school for kids, like you said.
I could open one, but...
...kids grow up.
Anyway, I guess I did it for myself.
Why, Mother?
Just wanted to be noticed.
Like I wanted you to notice me.
I still do, Mama.
Louise.
Okay, Mama.
Okay, Rose.
Say, you look like you should speak French.
You're coming to that party with me.
No.
Come on.
Like this?
Here, you can wear my mink.
I've got a stole in the car.
Well...
...only for an hour or two.
Say...
...this looks better on me than on you.
Funny how we can wear the same size.
Especially in mink.
You know, I had a dream last night.
It was a big poster of a mother and daughter.
You know, like the cover of that ladies' magazine.
Yes, Mother.
Only it was you and me, wearing exactly the same gown.
It was an ad for Minsky and the headline said:
"Madame Rose...
"...and her daughter Gypsy!"

Chickens!

Yeah!
All right, go, Jets!
Snowboy!
Come on!
Beat it!
Chico! Andale, chico!
Okay, here we go!
Over here, A-Rab!
Jets! Jets!
Bernardo! Indio! Chaco, come on!
Jets, come on! Follow me, baby.
- Mira, mira, mira!
- Jets!
Andale, Chico!
Come on, Jets!
Hey, Jets!
Hello!
Jets, come on! Julio!
Come on!
Jets!
Come on, boys!
Come on, now!
Jets!
Break it up, you punks! Cut it out!
Come on, guys! Break it up, I said!
Come on, break it up! Come on!
How many times have I told you punks to cut this stuff out?
- Why, if it ain't Lt. Schrank!
- Top of the day, Lt. Schrank.
- And Officer Krupke.
- Top of the day, Officer Krupke.
- I'll give you the top of the head.
- Hey you, get down!
- But we're having such fun.
- We enjoy the playground.
See, it keeps us deprived children off of the foul city streets.
Shut up!
And born like we was on the hot pavement.
- You wanna get your skull broke?
- Hey, Baby John, come here!
Come here!
All right!
Now, which one of these
Puerto Ricans bloodied you?
- Sir...
- Which one?
Excuse me, sir.
As a matter of fact... we suspicion that the job was done by a cop.
- Two cops.
- At the very least.
Impossible.
In America, nothing is impossible.
All right, wise guys... now, you listen to me!
All of you!
You hoodlums don't own these streets.
And I've had all the roughhouse I'm gonna put up with around here!
You wanna kill each other, kill each other!
But you ain't gonna do it on my beat!
- Are there any questions?
- Yes, sir.
Would you mind translating that into Spanish?
Get your friends out of here, Bernardo.
And stay out!
Please.
Okay, Sharks.
Vámonos.
Boy, oh boy!
As if this neighborhood wasn't crummy enough!
Now, look, fellas. Fellas!
Look, let's be reasonable... if I don't get a little law and order around here...
I get busted down to a traffic corner... and your friend don't like traffic corners.
So, that means you're gonna start makin' nice... with the PR's from now on.
I said nice! Get it?
'Cause if you don't... and I catch any of you doin' any more brawlin' in my territory...
I'm gonna personally beat the livin' crud out of each and every one of you... and see that you go to the can and rot there!
- Say good-bye to the nice boys, Krupke.
- Good-bye, boys.
"Good-bye, boys."
Jail? Gee.
"You hoodlums don't own the streets."
Go play in the park.
Keep off of the grass.
- Get out of the house!
- Keep off the block.
- Get outta here.
- Keep off the world!
A gang that don't own the street is nothin'!
We do own it!
Come on, Jets, round out!
- Not you, Anybodys! Beat it!
- Riff, you gotta let me in the gang!
Didn't you just see me? I was smash!
I'm a killer, I wanna fight.
How else she gonna get a guy to touch her?
- You dirty rat!
- Come on, the road, little girl! The road!
Beat it!
- Beat it!
- Okay, come on.
Okay, now listen!
Now, we fought hard for this turf, and we ain't just gonna give it up.
The Emeralds claimed it, we shot 'em out.
The Hawks, remember? They tried to take it away, we knocked them down the cellar.
- But these PR's are different.
- They multiply. Like cockroaches.
- Shut the door!
- They're eatin' all the food.
- Breathin' all the air.
- Help! I'm drowning in tamale.
And you heard what that Lt. Schrank said... we gotta make nice with them Puerto Ricans or else.
We gotta let 'em move in right under our noses...
- and take it all away from us or else.
- No!
You're damn right, no!
So what're we gonna do, buddy boys?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We're gonna speed back!
We're gonna move like lightnin', and we're gonna clean them Sharks up... once and for all.
So they ain't never gonna set foot on our turf again!
We're gonna do it in one all-out fight.
- A rumble! Chop, chop!
- Now cool, Action Boy.
The Sharks want a piece of this world, too.
And they're real down boys.
They might ask for blades...
- zip guns.
- Zip guns?
I ain't finalizin' and sayin' they will, Baby John.
I'm just sayin' that they might, and we gotta be prepared.
Now, what's your mood, Jets?
- I say go, go!
- I say mix!
- I say sock 'em!
- Tear them!
- Yeah, but if they say blades or guns...
- I say let's just forget the whole thing.
- What?
- What do you say, Riff?
I say this turf is small, but it's all we got.
I wanna hold it like we always held it, with skin!
But if they say blades, I say blades.
If they say guns, I say guns.
I say I want the Jets to be the number one!
- To sail! To hold the sky!
- Then rev us off! Voom va-voom!
Okay, cats, we rumble!
Now... protocality calls for a war council... between us and the Sharks to set the whole thing up.
So I will personally give the bad news to Bernardo.
- You gotta take a lieutenant with you.
- That's me.
- That's Tony.
- Who needs Tony?
We need Tony!
He's got a rep that's bigger than the whole West Side!
- He don't belong no more.
- Now, cut it, Action!
- Me and Tony started the Jets.
- So where is he?
- How come he takes a lousy, stinkin' job?
- Youth Board corrupted him.
- Yeah, temporary sickness!
- Wait and see.
Remember them fists the day we clobbered the Emeralds?
- He saved my ever-loving neck!
- Sure! He'll do it again, too!
He always came through for us and he always will.

Now, I know Tony like I know me, and
I guarantee you can count him in.
- Let's get crackin'.
- Where will you find Bernardo?
- It ain't safe in PR territory.
- He'll be at tonight's gym dance.
- But the gym's neutral territory.
- A-Rab, I'm gonna make nice with him.
- I'm only gonna challenge him.
- Right, daddy-o.
So listen, everybody dress up sweet and sharp.
Meet Tony and me at the dance after 10:00, and walk tall!
- We always walk tall!
- We're Jets!

- Tony, you're not even listenin'.
- I read you loud and clear, Riff.
- Then why don't you say somethin'?
- I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
- You're my buddy, my pal, my best friend!
- Womb to tomb?
Birth to earth.
That's why you gotta come to the dance tonight and stand up with me.
Come on, Tony. Just say yes.
Riff, did you ever stop to figure... how many bubbles there are in one bottle of this here soda pop?
Tony, this is important!
Everything's important, Riff... you, me, the sweet guy I work for.
The Sharks walk bad. They bite hard.
- And if we don't stop them now...
- Here! Work for a living.
How do you like that? Four and a half years I live with a buddy and his family.
I think I'm diggin' a guy's character.
Boy, am I a victim of disappointment in you!
End your sufferin', little man.
Why don't you just pack up your gear and move out?
'Cause your ma's hot for me.
No! It's 'cause I hate livin' with my buggin' uncle!
- Come on!
- Come on, uncle!
Now... go play games with the Jets.
And why not? They're the greatest.
Ain't they?
Were.
You found somethin' better?
No. Not yet, but...
But What?
You won't dig it, Riff.
So try me.
Come on, Tony, try me.
Okay.
Every single night for the last month, I wake up... and I'm reaching out.
- For what?
- I don't know.
A dame?
It's right outside the door, just around the corner... but it's comin'.
What is?
I don't know. It... it's like the kick I used to get from bein' a Jet.
Now you're talkin'!
Man, without a gang, you're an orphan.
With a gang, you walk in twos, threes, fours... and your crew is the best... when you're a Jet, you're out in the sun, buddy boy... you're home free home!
Riff, I've had it!
Tony...
Tony, look at me, will ya?
- Come on, look at me.
- I'm lookin' at you.
Now, I never asked the time of day from a clock, did I?
I never asked nothin' from nobody, but I'm askin' you... come to the dance tonight.
I promised Doc I'd clean up the store tonight.
Then do it after the dance.
Tony, I already told the guys you'd be there.
If you don't show,
I'll be marked lousy.
What time'd you tell 'em?
For me, Tony, for Riff!
- 10:00 it is.
- Womb to tomb?
Birth to earth, and I'll live to regret this.
Who knows? Maybe what you're waitin' for'll be twitchin' at the dance tonight.
Yeah. Who knows?

Por favor, Anita, you are my friend.
- Stop it, Maria.
- You must make the neck lower.
And you must stop heckling me.
We are working on our time now, not the old lady's.
- One inch. How much can one little inch do?
- Too much.
Anita, it is now to be a dress for dancing, no longer for praying!
Listen, with those boys, you can start in dancing and end up praying.
Querida, one little inch.
- Bernardo made me promise!
- Bernardo!
One month have I been in this country.
Do I ever even touch excitement?
I sew in this place all day.
I sit at home all night.
For what did my fine brother bring me here?
- To marry Chino.
- Chino.
- When I look at Chino, nothing happens.
- What do you expect to happen?
I don't know. Something.
What happens when you look at Bernardo?
It's when I don't look that it happens.
I think I will tell Mama and Papa about you and Nardo in the balcony... of the movies!
- I will rip this to shreds!
- No!
But if you perhaps could manage to lower the neck...
Next year.
I hate that dress!
Then don't wear it, and don't come to the dance with us tonight.
Don't come?
- Could we not dye it red at least?
- No, we could not.
White is for babies.
I will be the only one there in a white...
Sí.
It is a beautiful dress.
I love you!
- Are you ready, ladies?
- Nardo, come in.
Is it not beautiful?
Yes.
- Very.
- I didn't quite hear.
Very beautiful.
Come in, Chino. Do not be afraid.
- But this is a shop for ladies.
- We won't bite you till we know you better.
Chino, you will keep both eyes on Maria tonight in case I cannot. You too, Anita.
- My brother is a silly watchdog.
- My sister is a precious jewel.
What am I? Cut glass?
Nardo, it is most important that I have a wonderful time at the dancing tonight.
It is?
Because tonight is the real beginning of my life... as a young lady of America.

Nardo. Cómo está?
Chino. Chino!
Pepe! Pepe! Come on, guys!
Maria.
Look what I got.
Maria, these are some of my friends you've not met.
Pick up.
This is Loco.
- Mucho gusto.
- Encantada.
- Teresita. My sister Maria.
- Good evening.
- And this is Luis and Rosa.
- Encantada. Rosalie, ai.
Oye, Nardo.
All right, boys and girls. All right.
Attention, please!
Attention!
Come here.
Thank you.
My, this is a fine turnout we have here tonight.
It's all for you, glad hand.
I know all of you boys and girls... are here because you want to make new friends... and get closer to old ones.
Yeah!
So, tonight, kids, we're gonna do something special.
We're gonna have a get-together dance!
Ginger! Peachy!
All right, all right, now, kids, kids...
I want you to form two circles.
- How many?
- Two.
Boys on the outside, and girls on the inside.
Where are you?
All right.
Now... when the music stops... each boy dances with whichever girl is opposite, okay?
Okay!
Two circles, kids!
Well, it won't hurt you to try.
It hurts. It hurts! It hurts.
Snowboy.
I'm with it.
That's it, kids! Keep the ball rolling.
Round she goes, and where she stops, nobody knows.
All right, here we go.
Boys to my right, and girls to my left.
- Mambo!
- Mambo!
Go!
Tony!
Mambo!
Mambo!
You're not thinking I'm someone else?
I know you are not.
Or that we've met before?
I know we have not.
I felt...
I knew something never before was gonna happen, had to happen... but this is so much more.
My hands are cold.
Yours, too.
So warm.
So beautiful.
Beautiful.
It's so much to believe.
You're not making a joke?
I have not yet learned how to joke that way.
I think now I never will.
- Get your hands off, American!
- Nardo!
- Stay away from my sister.
- Sister?
- Couldn't you see he's one of them?
- I saw only him.
They want one thing from a Puerto Rican girl.
- That's a lie!
- Later, Tony!
- Get away!
- Don't listen.
She'll listen to me before she listens to you.
If you two want to settle this...
Please, boys!
Everything was going so well.
Now, come on! We're all here to have a good time, aren't we?
Nardo...
Take her out of here. We're going home.
- Nardo, it is my first dance.
- Please. We are family. Now go.
Come, Maria.
Maria.
- I don't want you.
- I want you, though.
I want you for a war council.
Jets and Sharks.
- The pleasure is mine.
- Let's go outside.
I would not leave the ladies here alone with your kind around.
We will meet you at midnight.
Doc's candy store?
And no jazz before then.
I understand the rules... native boy.
Ice.
- Doc's at midnight. Spread the word.
- Right, daddy-o.

Now, I do not say these things to spoil your evening... or to hear myself talk.
- I am here longer than you, Maria.
- Sí, Nardo.
Someday, when you're an old married woman with five kids... you can tell me what to do.
But right now it is the other way around.
Now go to bed.
He's the old married woman.
You know, she has a mother.
Also a father.
They do not know this country any better than she does.
And you do not know it at all.
Girls here are free to have fun.
- She is in America now.
- Puerto Rico is in America now.
Sometimes I don't know which is thicker, your skull or your accent.
Vámonos, muchachos!
Let them wait. Is Maria all right?
- I should be so all right.
- It will not happen again.
Pepe, Indio, after tonight, things will be settled.
- First settle your stomach.
- Never mind my stomach.
- I mind your nose and your head broken.
- Broken?
Sure! They use Maria for an excuse to start World War III.
- It is more than that.
- More than what? She was only dancing.
- With an American who's really a Polack.
- Says the Spic.
You are not so cute.
- That Tony is.
- And he works.
- A delivery boy.
- And what are you?
An assistant.
Sí, and Chino makes half of what the Polack makes.
Here comes the whole commercial!
Your mother's a Pole, your father's a Swede...
But you were born here, that's all that you need.
You are an American.
But us? Foreigners!
Lice! Cockroaches!
But it's true!
When I think of how I thought it would be for us here...
- we came like children believing...
- Trusting with our hearts open!
- With our arms open.
- You came with your mouth open.
You're the Spic, and you go back in handcuffs.
I'm going back in a Cadillac.
- Air-conditioned!
- Built-in bar!
- Telephone!
- And television!
Compatible color.
If you had all that here, why would you wanna go back to Puerto Rico?
Or even if you didn't have all that here, why would you wanna go back to Puerto Rico?
- It's so good here?
- It's so good there?
We had nothing!
We still have nothing, only more expensive.

Where the devil are them Sharks?
- Maybe they're too chicken to show.
- We got time, A-Rab.
- Riff and Ice ain't even here yet.
- Come on, come on!
- He don't use a switchblade.
- What?
- He don't even use an atomic ray gun.
- Who don't?
- Captain Marvel. Gee, I love him.
- So marry him!
I ain't never gonna get married.
Too noisy.
You ain't never gonna get married.
- Too ugly.
- Pow! Pow!
Wacko jacko!
Down goes a teenage hoodlum.
Gee, could a real zip gun make you do like that?
No, the zip gun could make you do.
You better wear diapers!
Go walk the streets like your sister.
Listen, jailbait, I licked you twice, and I can do it again!
Come on, Anybodys, knock it off.
- Riff's here.
- Okay, cats, all present and accounted for?
I'm really proud of you.
You did good at the dance.
- So where are they?
- Unwind, Action. Any sign of Tony?
Invisible, man.
What do you think the
Sharks are gonna ask for?
- Mercy.
- Just rubber hoses maybe.
Relax, little man.
- You tell him, daddy-o.
- I'm ready.
Easy. Cool.
Cracko jacko!
Riff, look, in a tight spot, you're gonna need every man you can get.
- No.
- An American tragedy.
- Pow!
- Poo.
Look, when the Sharks come, you chicks cut out.
We might, and then again, we might not.
This ain't kid stuff, Graziella.
I and Velma ain't kid stuff neither.
- Are we, Vel?
- No, thank you.
And you can punctuate it.
What are we poopin' around with dumb broads?
I and Velma ain't dumb!
The bulls!
- You.
- You!
- Who?
- Who?
Who me?
Top of the evening, Officer Krupke.
- You.
- Who, me, sir?
Yeah, you. Didn't you hear me?
Yes, sir. I got 20-20 hearing.
Then why didn't you answer me?
His mother told him never answer back to a cop.
You little wise apple!
You want me to run you in?
Indeed not, sir.
I oughta run all youse punks in.
What are ya standin' around here for, blockin' the sidewalks?
You see, sir, we're afraid to go home.
It's such a bad environment.
- We don't get no love there.
- It's awful.
If you don't leave us on the streets all night... we liable to turn into a bunch of juvenile delinquents.
Listen, I know youse guys was cookin' up somethin' at the dance.
So don't think you'll put nothin' over on me.
- Sergeant, come on, quick! We got a 10-13.
- Now, go on. Get a move on, all of youse.
And don't let me catch none of youse around here later.
I'll see you around.
You forgot to say good-bye.
Them headbusters ain't got no manners.
"And don't let me catch none of youse here later!"
- They treat us like we ain't even human.
- He was pretty mad.
So, what happened?
A big fat nothin', right?
Yeah, but suppose he comes back... while we are havin' the war council?
We'll snow him some more.
See, them cops... they believe everything they read in the papers about us JD's.
So that's what we give 'em, somethin' to believe in.
You!
- Who, me, Officer Krupke?
- Yeah, you! Give me one good reason... for not draggin' you down to the station house, you punk!

- Aren't you up a little late, Baby John?

- Any of you seen Tony tonight?
- You betcha we did.
He was supposed to clean up the store.
Maybe he decided to clean up the PR's instead.
Tony?
- Doc, you ain't gonna close up now.
- I'm not?
- Listen, we got a war council here.
- A who?
To determine weapons.
We gotta set up a mix with the PR's.
Weapons. You couldn't play basketball?
- Get with it, buster.
- You don't understand.
We got special business comin' here tonight.
- Makin' trouble for the Puerto Ricans?
- They make trouble for us.
For you, trouble is a relief.
We gotta stand up to 'em, Doc.
It's important.
Fightin' over a little piece of street is so important?
- To us, it is!
- To hoodlums, it is.
Who you calling hoodlum?
- War council...
- Don't start that.
- Rumbles. Why, when I was your age...
- When you was my age!
When my old man was my age, my brother was my age...
You was never my age, none of ya.
And the sooner you creeps get hip to that, the sooner you'll dig us!
I'll dig you an early grave, that's what I'll dig.
Dig, dig, dig!
- Okay, Doc, set 'em up. Cokes all around.
- Let's get down to business.
So, Bernardo hasn't learned the procedures of gracious living.
I don't like you, either, so cut it.
Okay, kick it, Dos.
- Boys, couldn't you maybe talk...
- Kick it!
We challenge you to a rumble.
All out, once and for all. Accept?
On what terms?
Whatever terms you're callin'.
You crossed the line once too often.
- You started it.
- Who jumped Baby John this afternoon?
Who jumped me the first clay I moved here?
- Who asked you to move here?
- Who asked you?
- Back where you came from.
- Spies.
- Mick!
- Wop!
We accept.
- Time?
- Tomorrow?
After dark.
- Place?
- The park?
The river.
Under the highway.
- Weapons?
- Doc! Doc!
- Tony!
- Weapons!
Weapons.
- You call.
- Your challenge.
Afraid to call?
Rocks.
Belts.
- Pipes.
- Cans.
- Bricks.
- Bats.
- Clubs.
- Chains.
Bottles, knives, guns!
- What a coop full of chickens.
- Who are you callin' chicken?
- Every dog knows his own.
- I'm calling you all chicken!
Big, tough buddy boys gotta throw bricks.
Afraid to get in close?
Afraid to slug it out?
Afraid to use plain skin?
- Not even garbage?
- That ain't a rumble.
- Who says?
- You said call weapons.
A rumble can be clinched by a fair fight, if you've got the guts to risk that.
Best man from each gang to slug it out.
I would enjoy to risk that.
Okay. Fair fight.
Wait a minute!
The commanders say yes or no.
Fair fight.
When I get through with you, you will be like a fish after skinning.
Your best man fights our best man.
And we pick him.
- But I thought I would be fighting with...
- You shook on it.
Yes. I shook on it.
Look, Bernardo, if you wanna change your mind...
Bernardo, baby, would you like a cigarette?
No, thank you. I don't smoke.
Evening, Lieutenant.
I and Tony was just closing up.
Now, this is more like it, fellas.
Warms me all over to see you this way.
And after only a couple of words from me at the playground. How about that?
Do you mind?
I have no mind. I'm the village idiot.
You know, headquarters hears about this, I may even get a promotion.
Good deal all around, Bernardo?
I get a promotion... and you Puerto Ricans get what you've been itchin' for... use of the playground, use of the gym... the streets, the candy store.
So what if they do turn this whole town into a stinkin' pigsty?
Don't stop him! He wants to get home, write letters to San Juan... tell 'em how he's got it made over here!
What I mean is, clear out, you!
I said, clear out!
Yeah, sure, I know.
It's a free country, and I ain't got the right.
But I got a badge.
What do you got?
Things are tough all over. Beat it!
Okay, fellas... where's the rumble gonna be?
Come on!
Regular Americans don't rub with the gold teeth unless...
- Lieutenant...
- You shut your mouth!
Come on, Baby John.
Before that smooth little kisser of yours gets out up for life.
Now, where's it gonna be?
The river?
The park?
Look, fellas, I'm for you.
I want this beat cleaned up, and you can do it for me.
I'll even lend a hand if things get rough.
Now, where you gonna rumble?
The playground?
Sweeney's lot?
Why don't you get smart, you stupid hooligans?
I ought to take you to the station and throw you in the can now!
You and the tinhorn immigrant scum you come from!
How's your old man's DT's, A-Rab?
How's the action on your mother's side of the street, Action?
One of these days, there won't be anybody to hold you.
Get him out of here!
Come on! Beat it! Go!
Don't worry!
I'll find out where it's gonna be.
So be sure to finish each other off, because if you don't, I will!
Yeah, sure.
Understand them.
That's what they keep telling me down at headquarters. "Understand."
You try keeping hoodlums in line, and see what it does to you.
It wouldn't give me a mouth like his.
Come on, Doc.
- Don't let it get you.
- I'm sick.
- You heard. It's gonna be a fair fight.
- And that's gonna cure somethin'?
From here on in, everything's gonna be all right.
- Got a feelin'.
- What have you been takin' tonight?
A trip to the moon!
And I'll tell you a secret, Doc.
It ain't a man that's up there. it's a girl.
A lady.
- Buenas noches, señor
- Buenas noches?
So that's why you made it a fair fight.
I'm gonna see her tomorrow, and I can't wait.
Tony! Things aren't tough enough?
- Tough? Doc, I'm in love!
- And you're not frightened?
Should I be?
No.
No, I'm frightened enough for the both of you.
What has Chino done to her?
Chino? Why Chino?
- Maybe she's just dolling up for us.
- Gracias, querida.
Rosalie, Consuelo, my adorable friends, can you keep a secret?
I'm hot for secrets.
No. I won't tell you.
- What?
- "What?"
The poor girl is out of her mind.
I am! Crazy.
She might be at that.
She looks somehow different.
- I do?
- And I think she is up to something.
I am?
"I do? I am?" She talks like a parrot.
What is going on with you, Maria?

You want to sing, do it with the needle, or you'll be out in the streets singing for your supper!
But Madam Lucia, what can you expect?
We use Singer sewing machines.
Sure.
You make the bad joke home where I can't hear it.
- Go now. Go home. it's closing time. Shoo!
- Buenas noches, Madam Lucia.
- You put down the shades?
- Yes.
Turn off the lights, and lock the doors.
- Buenas noches, Anita.
- Buenas noches.
- Adiós
- The jail is open.
I thought she'd never leave.
You know, it's hard to believe that old bag of a witch was once a young bag like us.
Come on, let's go before she changes her mind and comes back.
You go, querida. I will lock up.
- Why?
- I have work.
Do it tomorrow.
- I'm in no hurry.
- I am!
I'm going home now and take a nice, long bubble bath.
- Black orchid.
- Black orchid?
All over.
I gotta date with Nardo after the rumble.
What rumble?
Oh...well, uh...
Nardo's Sharks and those boys at the dance.
They fight each other tonight?
They don't play patsy.
Why must they always fight?
You saw how they dance, like they gotta get rid of something quick.
That's how they fight.
To get rid of what?
Too much feeling.
And they do get rid of it.
Boy, after a fight, that brother of yours is so healthy.
Definitely black orchid.
Buenas noches.
"You go, querida. I will lock up."
It's too early for noches.
Buenas tardes.
Gracias... buenas tardes.
He just came from the drugstore to deliver aspirin.
You'll need it.
Not us. We're fine.
- We're out of the world.
- You're out of your heads.
- We're 12 feet in the air.
- Anita can see that.
You will not tell?
Tell what?
How can I know what goes on 12 feet over my head?
You better be home in 15 minutes.
It's all right. She likes us.
- But she is worried, and so am I.
- That's foolish.
Are you going to that rumble tonight?
- No.
- Yes!
- Why?
- You must go and stop it.
I have stopped it. It'll only be a fistfight between two of 'em. Nardo...
Any fight is no good for us.
- Everything is good for us. We got magic.
- Listen and hear me.
You must go and stop it.
It means that much to you?
Yes.
All right, I will, then.
I believe you.
- You do have magic.
- Of course.
I've got you.
And tonight, after I stop the rumble that isn't a rumble...
I'll come by for you.
- I will wait for you on the roof.
- No.
Not the roof.
I'll come to your house.
You cannot. My mama.
- Then I'll take you to my house.
- Your mama?
She'll come runnin' from the kitchen to welcome you.
- She lives in the kitchen.
- Dressed so elegant?
I told her you were coming.
She'll look at your face. Try not to smile.
She'll say, "Skinny, but pretty."
She is plump, no doubt?
Fat.
I take after my mama. Delicate-boned.
Not in front of Mama!
I would like to see Papa in this.
Mama will make him ask about your prospects.
Many.
- If you go to church.
- Always.
Yes, Papa might like you.
- May I have your daughter's hand?
- He says, "Yes."
Gracias.
- And your mama?
- I'm afraid to ask her.
Tell her she's not getting a daughter.
She's getting rid of a son.
She says, "Yes!"
She has good taste.
Here. Maid of honor.
- That color is bad for Anita.
- The best man!
That is my papa!
Sorry, Papa.
Here we go, Riff. Womb to tomb.
Now, you see, Anita?
There was nothing to worry about.
Look! Mama's crying already.
I, Anton... take thee, Maria...
I, Maria, take thee, Anton...
For richer, for poorer...
In sickness and in health...
To love and to honor...
To hold and to keep...
From each sun to each moon...
From tomorrow to tomorrow...
From now to forever...
Till death do us part.
With this ring, I thee wed.
With this ring...

Ready.
- Now, move in and shake hands.
- For what?
That's the way it's done, buddy boy.
More gracious living?
Look, every one of you hates every one of us, and we hate you back.
Let's get at it.
- Sure.
- Here we go.
- Let's get in there...
- Come on, Ice.
Come on, Ice, come on!
Keep your eyes open!
Hold it!
Tony! Get with the gang. It's all okay.
No!
Tony, what are you doing?
Maybe he has found the guts to fight his own battles.
It don't take guts if you got a battle.
We ain't got one. None of us.
- Okay, Nardo?
- Tony!
Hold it! Now, let's just cool it.
The deal is, a fair fight between you and Ice.
- Come on, get with the gang.
- Mother hen protecting the little one?
- I'll give you a battle.
- You've got one!
I'll take pretty boy as a warm-up.
Afraid, pretty boy? Afraid, gutless?
- Afraid, chicken?
- Cut it!
No!
- I don't wanna, Bernardo.
- I'm sure.
- Now, listen to me.
- Are you chicken?
- There's no need to fight.
- The hell there ain't!
- You've got it wrong!
- Chicken!
- Why can't you understand?
- Understand, chicken!
- Get out of here!
- Kill him, Tony!
Come on!
- Afraid to fight?
- Come on.
- Let me see you fight.
- Chicken boy!
He is chicken!
Pretty boy. Listen to him!
Don't! Stop it!
We got nothin' to fight about.
- Bernardo!
- Yellow-bellied chicken!
- Don't push me!
- Come on, you yellow-bellied Polack!
- Riff! What are you doin'?
- Get outta here, Tony!
- Riff, don't!
- Hold him!
Let me go!
Riff, don't!
Keep outta this!
Somebody stop him!
Let me go!
Ice!
Tiger!
Riff!
- Come on, Nardo!
- Stop him!
Riff, don't!
Get them!
Maria!
Tony, come on! Come on, Tony!
We gotta get out of here! Come on!
Come on, Tony! Come on!
Get outta here!
Come on!
Come on, Tony!

Wait for me, Rosa.
Chino!
There was no one downstairs.
My mother and father are at the store.
I didn't expect you to come by.
- I would have waited down...
- Maria.
- You have been fighting, Chino?
- Yes.
- I am sorry.
- That is not like you.
- No.
- You must go home and wash up.
- I will see you tomorrow.
- Maria, at the rumble...
- There was no rumble.
- There was.
- No. You are wrong.
- There was.
Nobody meant for it to happen.
Tell me.
It is bad.
Very bad?
You see...
It will be easier if you say it very fast.
There was a fight.
And Nardo...
Somehow a knife...
- And Nardo and someone, they...
- Tony.
What happened to Tony?
Chino, tell me! Is Tony all right?
He killed your brother!
You are lying.
Chino, why do you lie to me?
Chino, true, you are lying! Why?
Why do you lie to me, Chino?
Mama! Mama!
- Bernardo está muerto!
- Bernardo, muerto?
No!
Santa María, make it not be true.
Please make it not be true.
Madre de Dios, I will do anything.
Make me die!
Only, please, make it not be true.
Make it not be...
Killer!
I tried to stop it.
I did try.
I don't know what went wrong.
I didn't mean to hurt him. I didn't wanna.
But Riff's like my brother... when Bernardo killed him,
Bernardo didn't mean it either.
I thought you knew.
I didn't come to tell you that.
Just for you to forgive me, so I can go to the police.
- No!
- It'll be easy now.
- I won't let you!
- I must.
- Stay! Stay with me.
- Maria, I love you so much!
Don't leave me!
Whatever you want, I'll do.
- Hold me!
- Forever!
Tighten it'll be all right. I know it.
We're really together now.
But it's not us.
It's everything around us.
Then I'll take you away, where nothing can get to us.
Not anyone or anything.

Baby John, what are you doin' here?
Nothin'.
What are you doin' nothin' here for?
Come on.
I don't want the guys to see me, A-Rab.
Why not?
I'm cryin'.
You are?
What for?
- I don't know. I'm just...
- Blow your nose.
A-Rab?
Yeah?
Did you get a look at their faces?
- Which faces?
- You know...
At the rumble. Riff and Bernardo.
Yeah.
- I wish it was yesterday.
- Me, too. I'm scared.
- Cut it out. You hear me? Cut it out!
- A-Rab, what are we gonna do?
We'll meet the other guys and form up.
That's what we'll do.
Now, come on. Let's go.
You got a handkerchief first?
What's wrong with your sleeve?
- Where you been?
- Where do you think, the Stork Club?
- We thought they nabbed you.
- Go on.
- You didn't see Tony?
- Nothin' but coppers.
What's wrong with him?
There's nothin' wrong.
He's okay, you get it?
All right, all right!
- Maybe we oughta go home.
- For what?
- Betcha they got him.
- Not Tony.
- Man, he was great, right, Baby John?
- Yeah.
- He really come through for the Jets.
- Just like Riff said he...
Said he would.
I want Riff!
Come on, Graziella.
Nobody was supposed to get killed.
It just...
They're gonna pay!
- Them stinkin' Sharks.
- Dirty fighting.
They started it!
So why don't we finish it?
We gotta show 'em who's on top.
- The Jets! Let's do it now!
- Ain't we had enough?
- What's the matter, you scared?
- Who you callin' scared?
- Lay off of him.
- Mind your own business.
Don't sound off on me. I'll...
- You'll do what?
- Knock it off!
Shut up down there, you dirty bunch of good-for-nothings!
Go home where you belong!
Who you callin' good-for-nothin', you loudmouth crud head?
Come down, I'll put this through your face!
- Get inside! All of you!
- Come on!
- Shut up!
- I don't have to take that from nobody!
Next creep who sounds on me,
I swear the next guy...
You'll laugh!
Yeah.
Now, you all better dig this and dig it good!
No matter who or what is eatin' you... man, you show it, and you are dead!
You are cuttin' a hole in yourselves for them to stick in a red-hot umbrella... and open it wide!
Man, you wanna get past the cops when they start askin' about tonight?
You play it cool.
You wanna live in this lousy world?
Play it cool.
- I wanna get even!
- Get cool!
- I wanna bust!
- Bust cool!

Okay.
Let's go.
Where we goin'?
If we lay low, the coppers are gonna smell fish.
- So the first thing we do...
- Buddy boy!
- Go wear a skirt.
- I got scabby knees. Listen...
First, start showing around like we got nothin' to hide.
Suppose they ask us about the rumble.
Supposin' they ask you where's Tony and what party's lookin' for him with a gun!
You know somethin'?
- I know I gotta go get a skirt.
- Come on, Anybodys!
- What's the freak know?
- Plenty!
I figured somebody oughta infiltrate PR territory... and spy around.
I'm very large with shadows, you know.
I can slip in and out of 'em like wind through a fence.
- Boy, is she ever makin' the most of it.
- You bet your fat "A," I am!
- Spill it!
- Okay.
I hear Chino tellin' the Sharks somethin' about Tony and Bernardo's sister.
And then I hear Chino say,
"If it's the last thing I do,
I'm gonna get that Polack."
And then he pulls out the bad news!
- Them PR's won't stop.
- Till we stop 'em.
Hold it!
Now, listen...
Tony come through for us.
We gotta come through for Tony.
- We gotta find him before Chino finds him.
- And burns him.
You cover the river!
Snowboy, get over to Doc's.
- I'll take the alleys.
- We'll take the streets.
- The park.
- The schoolyard.
We'll take the playground.
What about me?
You? In and out of the shadows.
- Maybe you'll find Tony in one of them.
- Right!
You done good, buddy boy.
Thanks, daddy-o.
Who is...
Maria.
Maria, it's Anita. You in there?
- Maria?
- Yes.
Open the door. I need you.
No.
- Now you are afraid, too?
- What?
I'll be right there.
- Together.
- But where?
The bus station. We'll go so far away, they'll never find us.
- How can we?
- Doc will help us. I'll get money from him.
- You'll meet me at his store.
- At Doc's, yes.
- I'll wait for you there.
- All right.
Yes.
Hurry!
Coming, Anita.
Anita.
- All right, now you know.
- And you still don't know.
He is one of them!
- No, Anita!
- Yes!

Chino has a gun.
I heard the boys talking.
- He's hunting for Tony.
- He is at Doc's store, waiting for me.
If Chino hurts him, if he touches him, I swear to you, I'll...
- You'll do what Tony did to Bernardo.
- I love Tony.
I know.
I loved Bernardo.
- Anybody home?
- Yes.
- Bernardo's sister, please.
- She isn't feeling well.
Who is?
Hello, miss.
I'm Lt. Schrank. I don't like to disturb you at a time like this...
Yes, a very bad time.
You'll excuse me, please.
- I have a couple of questions to ask.
- Afterwards, please.
- I must go to my brother now.
- Now, just one minute!
- Can't you wait?
- No!
Now.
You were at the dance at the gym last night...
Will this take very long?
As long as it has to.
Excuse me.
Anita, my headache is much worse.
Will you go to Doc's store for me?
Don't you people keep aspirin around?
This is something special.
Will you go for me, Anita?
What shall I ask for?
Doc will know.
Tell him I have been detained and can't get there right away... or I would have picked it up myself.
Excuse me. You were asking?
Yeah.
At the gym last night, your brother got into a heavy argument... because you danced with the wrong boy.
- Yes.
- Who was the boy?
Another from my country.
And his name?
José.
- Can't find him. He ain't nowhere.
- He's right down there in the cellar.
- Tony?
- Safe and sound.
- I found him.
- You warn him about Chino?
- What's he doin' in the cellar?
- Keepin' the mice company, stupid.
- No sign of Chino?
- Nothin'.
His luck.
I'll slip out the back and check the alleys again.
- You guys hang here.
- Right.
- Boy, I'm thirsty. Where's Doc?
- Upstairs raising getaway money for Tony.
- Doc ain't got no money.
- His mattress has.
Come on. Cut the frabberjabber.
Grab some readin' matter.
Play the juke. Some of you get outside.
If you see Chino or those stinkin' PR's comin...
- I'd like to see Doc.
- He ain't here.
- Where is he?
- He went to the bank.
They made a mistake in his favor.
The banks are closed at night.
Where is he?
You know how skinny Doc is.
He slipped in through the night-deposit slot.
And got stuck halfway in.
Which indicates there's no tellin' when he'll be back.
Buenas noches, señorita.
Where you goin'?
- Downstairs.
- Didn't I tell you he ain't here?
I'd like to see for myself.
Please.
Please.
Por favor.
- Will you let me pass?
- She's too dark to pass.
- Don't
- Please don't.
- Por favor.
- No comprende.
- Gracias.
- De nada.
Mambo!
- Listen, you!
- We're listenin'.
Look, I gotta give a friend of yours a message.
- I gotta tell Tony...
- He ain't here.
- I know he is.
- Who says he is?
- Who's the message from?
- Never mind.
Couldn't be from Chino, could it?
Don't you understand? I want to help!
- Bernardo's girl wants to help?
- Even a greaseball's got feelings.
- But she wants to help get Tony.
- No!
- Not much. Bernardo's tramp.
- Bernardo's pig!
- You lyin' Spic!
- Don't do that.
- Gold tooth!
- Pierced ear!
- Don't.
- Garlic mouth.
- I want to help!
- Come on!
- Go!
- Chiquita!
No!
Olé! Olé!
Hey, babe!
Come on!
Let's get her!
- No, you don't.
- Come on, baby.
Come on!
Stop it!
What are you doing there?
Bernardo was right.
If one of you... was lying in the street bleeding... l'd walk by and spit on you!
She'll tell Chino that
Tony's in the cellar.
Don't you touch me!
I got a message for your American buddy.
You tell that murderer that
Maria's never going to meet him!
You tell him that Chino found out about them... and shot her!
She's dead!
When do you kids stop?
You make this world lousy!
We didn't make it, Doc.
Get outta here!
Maria?
Doc, I thought I heard... You got it!
- Yes, I got it.
- Doc, you're a pal.
You're the best friend a guy ever had.
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
I promise.
- Forget that.
- No, I'll never! I couldn't.
Doc, you know what we're gonna do in the country, Maria and me?
We'll have kids, and we'll name 'em all after you... even the girls, so when you visit us...
Wake up!
Is this the only way to get through to you... do just what you all do, bust like a hot water pipe?
What's got into you?
Why do you kids live like there's a war on?
Why do you kill?
I told you how it happened.
Maria understands.
- I thought you did, too.
- Maria understands nothing...
Never again.
There is no Maria, Tony.
What?
- I can't.
- No, no, Doc.
Now, tell me. What is it?
That was Anita upstairs.
Chino found out about you and Maria... and he killed her.
No.
Maria.
Not Maria, Doc.
She's...
Chino!
Come and get me, too, Chino!
- Come and get me, too!
- Tony!
Who's that?
- It's me, Anybodys. Come on.
- Get out of here!
- Chino, come and get me, damn you!
- What are you doin'?
Get out of here!
Why don't you come with me?
We'll find...
It ain't playin' anymore!
Can't any of you get that?
- But the gang...
- You're a girl! Be a girl and beat it!
Come on, Chino! Get me, too!
I'm callin' for you, Chino!
There's nobody here but me. Come on!
Please, will you?
I'm waitin' for you.
I want you to.
Maria.
Tony!
Maria.
I didn't believe hard enough.
Loving is enough.
Not here.
- They won't let us be.
- Then we'll get away.
Yeah.
- We can.
- Yes.
- We will.
- Yes.

How do you fire this gun, Chino?
Just by pulling this little trigger?
How many bullets are left, Chino?
Enough for you?
And you?
All of you!
You all killed him, and my brother, and Riff... not with bullets and guns.
With hate!
I can kill, too, because now I have hate!
How many can I kill, Chino? How many?
And still have one bullet left for me?
No!
Don't you touch him!

This place could sure use a woman.
I got Molly.
Yeah.
'Course, she can't cook worth a damn and devil a bit of talent she's got for housekeepin' as you can see, but she does her share.
Does most of the huntin' and fishin'.
Ain't it about time somebody told that motherless lass she's a girl?
'She hunts and fishes, whistles like a calliope'
'and my boys here tell me she swears like a bargeman.'
[chuckles]
Been doing that since she was three.
Uh, she's reached the age for getting into trouble.
About time to marry her off, Shamus.
'Marry? Who'd marry Molly?'
Well, there must be somebody who doesn't know her.
Hey, whatever happened to that Johnson boy who was hanging around here a while back?
He tried to show her his pa's hayloft.
She tied a can to his tail and sent him r-rattling down the road.

That's been the only one.
There's your boys.

'You leavin' home, Molly?'
It's time, pa.
I've thought it through.
There's nothin' for me here.
Here you're just born, and you live, and you die.
What more is there,
Molly girl?
Somewhere there's just got to be things to see and do more than what there is here.
I'm gonna marry me a-a rich man like Katie Spinner did.
Be careful about the love of money, Molly girl.
Oh, it ain't the money I love, pa.
It's the not havin' it
I hate.
I'm gonna somehow get me to Denver and I'm gonna find me a man with means enough to put a real roof over our heads a roof that don't leak rain and cold.
'I'm leaving at sunup, pa.'
I'll miss you, Molly.
I'll miss you too, pa.
It's time I thanked you for pullin' me out of the flood and...and raisin' me like your own.
I guess, I didn't know much about raising a girl.
Could be I done it wrong.
You done fine.
Nobody could have done better.
I'll send for you, pa.
I promise that.
And you'll have a room of your own where you can stay in bed all day with a jug of the best liquor.
I do that now.
Let me give you a word of advice, Molly girl.
Learn to serve God and a hot breakfast and in your search for that roof that don't leak rain beware of men that offer you a roof and forget to mention marriage.
Find yourself a good man.
A good Irish Catholic and settle down.
The man I marry is got to be more than just Irish Catholic.
What more can a man be?
Well, if he's gonna crawl in next to me he's gonna have to be the richest Irish Catholic next to the pope!

- Long enough.
Humph! A nice pastime for a grown man.
- Yep.
- Go away.
This here's my land.
You're trespassing.
Oh.
What are you doin' here?
Washing off the dust of the road.
My feet hurt.
Been walkin' for three days.
- Alone?
- 'Why not?'
How far is it to Leadville?
Long ways, maybe ten miles.
'Where'd you sleep last night?'
Under a tree.
You're welcome to spend the night in my cabin.
Oh, I am, am I?
If you think you're reading my mind, missy, you're wrong.
I ain't that needy.
'Besides, you ain't that much, you know.'
[gasps]
We.. You're no prize!
Heh, back home where I come from we drown runts of the litter like you.
[chuckling]
Hey.
When-when did you eat last?
Yesterday mornin'.
I got a pot on the stove up there.
You can sleep under a tree if you're that mistrustful.
You'd better stoke up on some stew.
Come on, let's eat.
Uh, that's real kind of you, mister, uh..
Brown. John J. Brown.
[instrumental music]
Come on in. Set.
Rest your feet.
It sure.. It sure smells good.
What are you, uh, gonna do in Leadville?
Uh, it's just a stoppin'-off place for me to get some money.
The place I'm really heading for is Denver.
Oh? What's in Denver?
Beautiful people.
Rich people.
I'm gonna get me a fine man a rich man, a millionaire!
Hmm. Sounds like me.
Huh! I'm gonna learn to read and write.
Can you read?
Sure!
Schooling till I was nine.
Read me what this says.
''Best regards from
Katie Spinner.''
- What does that mean?
- What does what mean?
Regards.
Uh..
Uh, it-it means not just regards but, um, best regards.
Uh.
I see.
Best regards.
Whatever the hell that means.
And this one.
Um, ''Christmas greetings from Katie Spinner.''
That must have been at Christmastime!
Must-must have been.
[chuckles]
Ain't that beautiful?
Look at them big buildings.
What's the printin' say?
Uh, it's, uh,
''Pennsylvania Avenue
Denver, Colorado.''
Pennsylvania Avenue.
That's, uh..
That's where the rich folks live.
That's where
I'm gonna live.
Before or after you hook the millionaire?
After.
[laughing]
'What are you gonna use for bait?'
Uh, Chick-a-Pen, I-I'm sorry.
You got a, you-you got a real nice...face.
I'm probably the only man in 20 miles that knows you're a-a...woman.
Capital W and two-two O's.
Uh, uh, let's eat.
I got to get goin'.
There's plenty of time.
Leadville's just over the hill.
Just over the hill?
'Mm-hmm. Maybe a mile.'
You said it was a long ways.
You said maybe ten miles and welcome to spend the night in your cabin.
Oh, you scabby he-goat!
My pa warned me about this but you're sure a smooth one flimflammin', sweet-talkin'.
Here I am under that roof!
Wha-what's the roof got to do?
Now, I'm gettin' outta here you double tongue, low-minded sneaky scheming polecat!

Ooh. It's a great show.

Oh, I can do it.

Okay.

Oh, sure. Sure.

Thank you, Mr. Brown.
You left it in my cabin.
Mm-hmm.
Thought-thought you might want it.
Oh, yes. Uh..
I-I wouldn't wanna lose them picture postcards of Denver.
Don't-don't know what's the use of them if you can't read them.
Oh, but I'm gonna learn to read.
Well, who's gonna teach you?
You?
'''The cat sees the rat.'
''The rat sees the cat.
''The cat runs after the rat.
''This is my hat.
It is a red hat.''
What happened to the rat?
Cat ate it.
Oh.
Huh?
''The little girl's name is Mary.
''The little boy's name is Tom.
''This is the barn.
''Mary and Tom are in the hayloft.
''This is Mary's mother.
She is baking a pie.''
Hmm, she better stop bakin' and go take a look in the barn.
[sputtering]
''My name is Molly Tobin.
My teacher is Johnny Brown.''
- It's real nice.
- Oh, thank you.
Um, guess you'll be leavin' real soon.
I hear the money's rollin' in.
Hmm, I'll have to buy some new clothes.
I've got $50.
It ain't enough.
What'd be enough, Molly?
I don't know, enough so's me and my pa could have a roof over our heads that don't leak rain and cold.
Go on, Chick-a-Pen.
I got to know.
Enough so's I could have a stove for heatin' and a stove for cookin' enough so's I could have my own brass bed enough so's I could have saucers that match the cups.
And enough so's my pa could stay in bed all day with a jug, if he had a hankerin' to.
And enough so's folks would call me a lady.
Well, that'd take a helluva lot more than $50.
That's why I got to find me a miner with a rich claim.
I got a claim, side of Hippo Mountain.
- Plenty of silver in it.
- Oh-ho!
No foolin', a gentleman from New York has been trying to buy it.
I ain't got much use for money.
I do alright.
If the Hippo Mountain claim runs out
I'll find me another.
Find you another?
Just like that?
Sure. It's easy.
'Cause I got a talent for it.
Gold and silver they just holler out to me.
Well, hell's fire!
Why don't you listen?
I take all I need out of it..
...and I got my other piece of land with a cabin on it.
Well, that's real pretty land with a stream and all.
Remember?
But-but it needs a woman.
Hmm.
Get yourself one.
A gal could be happy there, Molly.
Why won't you settle for happiness?

Howdy?
Ah, the way you're prettied up you think we was going to church instead of showing me a mine.
Didn't say I was gonna show you a mine.
You said you was gonna show me what you've been workin' on.
That's right. Hup!
[instrumental music]
Johnny Brown, I know this place.
You're taking me to that little old cabin of yours.
You know better than that.
Now, hold your britches, missy.
I ain't taking you to my little old cabin. Ho ho!
Oh, it's my big, new cabin.
'Oh, Johnny.'
Well..
...dip me and fry me.
Wait till you see what I got to show you.
This here is the porch.
Two rockers for settin' out on summer nights.
Ah, how nice.
This here's the main room.
I got a stove for heatin'.
And a, and-and a stove for cookin'.
And-and cups with saucers that match.
Oh.
Oh..
...you sure do remember things,
Johnny Brown.
Things you say, Chick-a-Pen.
Come-come on. Come on.
Come on.
There's a room for your pa.
You built a room for pa?
And a jug on the table just waitin' for him.
- Oh.
- Come on. Come on.
[instrumental music]
Oh! Oh.
Oh.
You got yourself a bed.
I'll say that for you, Johnny Brown.
You, you like it, Molly?
Oh.
Oh, I..
It's the most beautiful thing
I-I ever seen.
- Oh!
- Um, look here.
Now you can do your bathin' inside the house.
Golly. Ain't that somethin'?
Oh, it sure is pretty.
Oh...oh..
...that bed.
Oh...oh..
It's so soft.
But real strong.
Oh, it come all the way from Denver.
You done all this for me.
Nobody never done nothing special for me before...just for me..
...in my whole life.
We're gettin' ma-married today.
It's against all the things
I ever dreamed of.
It'd be against nature for me to say no.
Besides, I-I sure couldn't stand anybody else sleepin' in that beautiful brass bed with the stars shining--
- Ready?
- Ready for what?
What?

Congratulations, Molly darling.
Hurry up, father, before she changes her mind.
I got her softened up real good.
Now, go on. Get started.
- You got the ring?
- Huh?
- The ring.
- Oh, the ring.
Yeah, I got the ring.
The ring. Uh, ring. Ring. Ring?
- I forgot the ring!
- It's alright.
- 'This will do for now.'
- This will do for now.
Come on...inside. Come on.
Oh, I forgot.
You, come on.
It's your weddin'.
[indistinct chatter]
Ha! Whee!
- Congratulations!
- Christmas, it's that way.
- That way.
- Come on. Goodnight.
Goodnight!
Goodnight, Polak!
[crying]
That was...beautiful wedding
I've ever seen.
Some-something wrong,
Mrs. Brown?
[crying]
A paper ring..
...and no wedding dress..
...and you're sozzled.
So was everybody.
It was a fine weddin'.
Not for me.
Not for me!
Oh, what have I gone and done?
Oh, I've gone and married me a-a drunken, good-for-nothing miner who don't even work at minin' and..
And what's the use of cups and saucers if you don't care?
I let myself be bamboozled by a b-brass bed and a, and a cooking stove and-and a room for pa and a, and a lot of fine talk and..
...and-and my heart that went waboom when you touched me.
[Molly crying]
'What have I gone and done?'
[crying]
Johnny?
Johnny?
Johnny?
Johnny!
[echoing]
Johnny! Johnny!
[instrumental music]
[music continues]
It's me, Chick-a-Pen.
Oh, Johnny!
Oh, Johnny!
Are you alright?
Are you alright?
Sure, darlin'.
Oh..
That's good!
Now, I'm gettin' out!
- What for?
- 'What for?'
Leavin' me alone here for three days worryin' my heart out.
Wait, Mrs. Brown, don't you wanna know where I've been?
- Oh, I can guess.
- No, you got it all wrong.
Now, here, look.
Lookie here.
Oh...whoa...whoa!
Three hundred thousand dollars.
Sold my claim to that gentleman from New York.
Ah, it took me a while to find and sign these papers and get the cash but now
I'm back home and you you ain't mad at me, are you?
Oh! Oh, Johnny.
I thought you was mad at me for carrying on so after the weddin'.
I-I thought you didn't want me.
- Oh, Chick-a-Pen!
- Oh, oh.
Calm down, girl.
Oh, I-I've been travelin' for three days and I ain't fit for a bride in a fine brass bed.
Well, I better go get washed up.
Uh, w-what are you gonna buy with all that money?
Oh, my! I don't know.
Well, first, we'll send for pa and then, and then we'll get you a fine gold watch
A-and you'll have a real gold wedding ring..
...and a, and a red dress..
...and a, and a go-to-hell hat!
[laughing]
Oh...oh..
Oh...oh, my..
Uh...oh..

[fire sizzling]
'Johnny? Is that you, Johnny?'
It's me, darlin'.
Having a little drink to warm myself up.
That water sure is icy.
Your-your hair's real wet.
Oh, I was shaking with the cold.
- Yeah.
- I...I'm fine now.
My backside's hot as a griddle.
I was warming it by the fire.
Fire.
- Fire? What fire?
- The stove.
No! No! The money, no!
- 'What?'
- No!
Molly girl, what is it?
Oh, the money!
The money!
What-what's the matter?
You gone crazy?
No, oh, I hid the money in the stove.
- Ow! Ooh!
- Water.
- Water!
- Oh! No, no, no.
[grunting]
Molly, girl, you-you'll burn yourself!
- No. No.
- Get away from there!
Molly!
It's too late, Molly!
My ring's on fire!
My ring, look it's ashes!
Oh, the money and my ring!
Everything's gone!
- Aah!
- Wait a minute!
- No! No.
- Now, Molly, wait, now listen.
- No, now, look!
- No! No.
Now, listen.
Look, it's only money.
I can get us more. No
- Listen to me, darling.
- No! No!
- Darling? Darling!
- No! No! No! Uh.
Darling?
[Molly grunts]
You ain't gonna wallop me?
What for?
It's me who lit the fire.
You ain't m-mad at me?
[scoffs]
Of course not!
Well, then what was you chasing me around the room for?
'Cause you was runnin'. I thought you's out of your skull.
- What was you running for?
- Uh..
Well, I was..
...I was just...scared, that's all.
What?
I was just...sc-scared.
Of me?
Well, I-I thought..
...I thought you was gonna wallop me.
I will wallop you if you don't come on back to bed!
[sobbing]
- Oh, Johnny!
- Oh, now, now, come on.
You don't wanna keep that sobbing up all night.
- Shh, shh, shh.
- I-I-I just can't seem to stop.
Oh, I don't want you crying over the money.
- Now, shh, shh, shh.
- I ain't.
It's you being so forgiving that..
[Molly crying]
Now we'll never get to Denver!
[Molly crying]
[sighs]
Well, if you're gonna keep up that weeping and wailing might as well go out right now and find me another mine.
Johnny? Come back!
Talk to me, gold and silver!
Holler loud, 'cause I got a gal that burns money up!
Johnny! Johnny!
Come back!
You gonna stop that crying?
Yes! Yes!
Oh, yes, Johnny! Yes!
Say you love me.
I love you, Johnny.
[laughs]
That's better.
[pickaxe clangs]
Oh, Joh.. Joh..
- Oh-oh!
- Yee-haw!
[screaming]
Ladies and gentlemen we are now entering
Pennsylvania Avenue.
Up and down this beautiful avenue are the homes of the Sacred Thirty-Six.
The Creme de laCreme of Denver.
The house on your left..
...is the home of Mrs. McGraw the acknowledged leader of Denver Society.
And this is the new showplace of Pennsylvania Avenue.
'It has just been remodeled by Mr. and Mrs. J.J. Brown' owner of the little Johnny Mine the richest gold strike in the history of Colorado.
This mine has already produced $10 million.
'Fourteen million, and plenty more'
'where that come from.'
Good-bye, folks!
Have yourself a nice ride.
And don't believe everything that fellow tells you.
- Pa!
- Goodbye! Goodbye.
I told you you mustn't do that every day, now, pa.
- It ain't elegant.
- I got nothing else to do.
- Funny.
- Leave it lay.
How many times do I gotta tell you
I like a lived-in feeling in one room of this fancy house.
Alright, pa.
And tell Hotchkiss to fetch me a fresh jug.
Ooh. Sure, pa.
Thank you, darling.
Hotchkiss!
- Yes, madam?
- Get my pa another jug.
Yes, madam.
[whistling]
What's that?
Present.
Ooh! What is it?
It's a new wedding ring.
What's wrong with this one?
That ain't the one you was married with.
[Molly chuckles]
I got you another, more fitting.
Now, don't you never, ever take it off unless I tell you to,
Chick-a-Pen.
Promise me.
I promise.
Oh! A-A cigar band!
Injun head and all!
And-and rubies and sapphires and diamonds!
The-the-the man said there ain't another like it in the whole world.
Oh, it's real beautiful, Johnny.
Thank you.
I'm glad you like it.
What do you wanna do today?
I don't know.
Wanna go out and buy something?
- We done that yesterday.
- Mm.
Wanna go for a walk?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Let's play another game of blackjack.
[knock on door]
- Yeah?
- Excuse me, madam.
Mr. Cartwright from the bank is downstairs.
Well, you tell him we'll be right there.
Thank you, madam.
Johnny, you go down and talk to him.
I gotta find my shoes. Oh!
- Hurry up.
- Yeah.
Uh! I'll be right down!
Oh...oh!
[instrumental music]
[panting]
Howdy, Mr. Cartwright!
Nice to see you.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Brown.
How's things at the bank,
Mr. Cartwright?
- Fine.
- Have a seat, Mr. Cartwright.
Thank you. Nice weather we've been having.
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, sit here.
This one's a good chair.
Cost a pot of money.
- Thank you.
- Oh, my.
Oh, it's a, it's a pleasure to be seeing one of Denver's
Sacred Thirty-Six in our home.
- Yeah.
- Sit-sit-sit down.
Oh, uh, it gets kinda lonesome around here.
That's why we thought it'd be a fine idea for you to come here this time, instead of us running to the bank.
Yes, I understand.
I have the money right here.
Oh, that's fine.
Now-now, you just sit a while.
Oh, no, I must get back to the bank.
'Hotchkiss!'
Hotchkiss, where's me jug?
Pa! Say hello to Mr. Cartwright!
Mr. Cartwright, say hello to my pa.
Howdy, Mr. Cartwright.
Nice to see a new face.
It gets pretty lonesome around here. Hotchkiss!
You think with the place crawling with flunkies a thirsty man could get a jug now and then.
Well, don't you want to count it?
- Oh, guess you've done that.
- Yeah.
Here.
Oh, how about some fudge?
Not right now, thank you.
Well...oh, you keep that.
- Yeah.
- Thank you, no.
I-I-I must get back to the bank.
- Oh.
- Oh.
Well, uh, drop in and see us again sometime, Mr. Cartwright.
- Uh, yeah. Bring your friends.
- Yeah.
Oh, bring Mrs. Cartwright.
- We're always here.
- Yes.
Good heavens!
I've never seen anything like that before.
'Eh, it's solid gold!'
Eh, yeah, that's what it is.
Uh, I presume the ''B'' stands for Brown?
Well, it don't stand for backhouse.
[both laughs]
Oh, uh, Mr. Cartwright, you come back real soon.
Well, ha-ha thanks again,
Mr. Cartwright.
You come see us real soon.
- Yes.
- Yeah?
Oh, uh
'what's going on over there?'
Oh, it must be the caterer delivering things for Mrs. McGraw's party.
Party? What party?
Mrs. McGraw gives a party every year when her roses bloom. Goodbye.
- Uh, bye.
- Bye.
Oh, ain't that wonderful?
What?
She gives a party when her roses bloom.
Oh, my.
[instrumental music]
Oh, good evening, father!
I believe you all know
Monsignor Ryan.
You've been fortunate in the weather, Mrs. McGraw.
- The garden is most attractive.
- Oh, thank you.
I, uh, I haven't been here since the house next door was remodeled.
Oh, yes. Dreadful, isn't it?
But at least the noise of the remodeling is over.
I've seen Mrs. Brown on the Avenue.
She's a little...strange.
- Oh!
- They overpay their servants.
The entire economy of Pennsylvania Avenue has been affected.
I'm told they drive up and down the avenue while she shouts greetings to passers-by.
- Oh, dear.
- Well, perhaps they're lonely.
Have you called on them to welcome them, Mrs. McGraw?
Mrs. Fitzgerald?
Uh, monsignor, have you seen the roses?
Thank you, Jeeves.
Oh, my!
Ooh! Evening, folks!
Uh, Molly Brown's the name.
Uh, this here's Johnny Brown owner of the Little Johnny.
'And richest man in the United States.'
- 'Molly.'
- Oh, there you be, neighbor!
'Howdy!'
Uh, Brown's the name.
Uh, we, we're the ones from that little shack next door.
How do you do, Mrs. Brown?
Great!
Uh, to tell you the truth the Denver water is a little hard on the kidneys.
But we love it here.
Oh, uh, Mr. Brown!
- Hmm?
- 'Say hello to Mrs. McGraw.'
Sure. Howdy.
Uh, oh, we-we was out for a walk and, and saw your lights was on, so we just thought we'd drop in.
Uh, may I present
monsignor Ryan?
Well, hello there, monsignor.
Glad to make your acquaintance.
- Yeah. Mr. Brown.
- Howdy.
Oh, uh, I read about your school fund in the paper, father.
Here's $5,000, and good luck.
[indistinct chattering]
Well, I hardly know what to say.
- God bless you, Mrs. Brown.
- Oh.
Well, what you standing there for, Mr. Brown?
Match my 5,000.
Or be high-class and double it.
'Why, sure. Glad to.
Here, father.'
One, two, three..
Already took a few million out of God's good earth.
Guess he deserves a little kickback.
That should see them into heaven.
Well, maybe it'll grease the gates a little.
...nine, ten. Ten thousand.
I'm sorry it's all in ones.
God bless you both.
- Fifteen thousand dollars.
- Uh, think nothing of it.
Once took 20 times that just to warm J.J.'s backside.
Besides, this here's our home now and-and-and we want to belong.
Got to keep up with Mrs. McGraw.
How much did you kick..
Uh...how much did you kick in, Gladys?
Oh, well, as a matter of fact, I..
...I haven't made my contribution yet.
- You haven't?
- No.
What's the matter with you, Gladys?
You got plenty, I hear!
- Now, Roberts!
- Dinner is served, madam.
Thank you. Well, shall we?
[indistinct chatter]
Oh!
Oh. Hi.
Howdy.
Well..
[sighs]
Uh, Mrs. McGraw regrets that there isn't room at the table for two more.
'Uh, she hopes you will excuse her.'
Oh, well, we just popped in.
Uh, tell her it was great meeting her and-and not to give the Browns a second thought.
Yes, madam.
I'm sorry you aren't staying but I assume you had other plans.
Oh, yes. We're pretty busy.
You-you go on inside before your supper gets cold.
Goodnight.
May God go with you.
- Goodnight.
- See you in church.
Yes.
- Come on.
- Oh, wait. Oh, wait.
Oh, I just gotta see how they do.
Uh, come on.
[instrumental music]
Oh, my!
Ain't that pretty?
Well, uh, there's, there's plenty of room at that table.
[chuckles]
It sure smells good, Gladys.
Eat hearty, folks!
[music continues]
[[door closes]
Come on, Moll. Come on.
[instrumental music]
Wasn't that fine?
All them beautiful people.
Everything trimmed so gorgeous and, and the people as trimmed, too.
Oh, the good lord outdid itself on Pennsylvania Avenue when we're right smack in the middle of it.
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you have a good time?
Mm. We had more fun back in Leadville by accident than they're having there on purpose.
They're a bunch of cold fish.
Come on.
Oh, no, that's dignity,
Mr. Brown.
Dignity.
And we're gonna get us some.
They could have made room for us.
There was plenty of room at that table.
- Well, howdy!
- Howdy, Shamus!
- 'Howdy, folks!'
- She knows my name.
I know plenty.
Come in, come in, you pretty thing.
- Evening.
- Evening.
We're havin' a bite to eat.
Come in and sit awhile.
Thank you kindly.
- 'Howdy!'
- Howdy!
- Howdy!
- Howdy!
Hey, how about, uh, dish of stew?
Oh, I'd rather have a beer.
Oh, pa.
Well, that was sure a dreary party, wasn't it?
- Was you there?
- No, but I was watching.
I'm Mrs. McGraw's ma.
Well!
Well, howdy, Ms. McGraw.
Not Mrs. McGraw. Grogan.
Me daughter Gladys married a McGraw but I'm Mrs. Grogan,
Buttercup Grogan.
How come you ain't at the party, Buttercup?
Ain't never invited to Gladys' parties.
She keeps me hid upstairs.
- Hid?
- When she has company.
She's the leader of Denver Society, you know.
Well, now, that ain't a nice way to treat you, Mrs. Grogan.
Oh, I don't mind.
Them friends of hers with their pinkies up, ain't my kind of folks.
[laughs]
Well, it's sure good to be here.
Took me a little time to get up the nerve to come.
What are you going to do about it?
About what?
About Gladys and the way she gave you the brush-off tonight.
'Wasn't neighborly, and that's a fact!'
Well, there wasn't any room at the table.
- Bull-sugar!
- Bull-sugar!
[both laughs]
Gladys is giving you the treatment.
Don't you let her.
Nah, Moll doesn't need
Mrs. McGraw.
Well, she does.
You're living here.
You've got to belong.
But Denver's giving you the go-by!
It is true. We get pretty lonesome around here.
Hold your tongue, pa!
We're doing fine!
No, we ain't doing fine and that's a fact.
You ain't going about this right.
You can't just yell ''hello'' to folks in the street.
You must invite them formal to your house with printed invitations.
A party!
With invitations printed in gold!
That's the ticket!
Oh, we'll give the biggest high-tone hellbender of a party
Pennsylvania Avenue ever seen!
- A flaming tote!
- A randy dan!
With a band playing music, like at Mrs. McGraw's only bigger and louder!
[laughing]
[all laughing]
[instrumental music]
Come on back, Chick-a-Pen.
If anybody was to come, they'd know for sure this here is where the Browns live.
Hell, honey, you've got it writ on everything from the weathervane to the hitching post.
Now, come on.
It's after 10 o'clock.
[music continues]
I'm sorry it turned out like this, Molly.
I bet it was Gladys what gave you the axe.
I should have known.
I am walking
Buttercup home, Moll.
- Goodnight, Buttercup.
- 'Goodnight, Molly.'
Thanks for coming.
[door closes]
I'm sorry there ain't no party, monsignor.
Sit down a minute, Molly.
Johnny.
I guess the Sacred Thirty-Six just don't want no part of us.
Molly...Molly..
...this is not New York or Paris.
Denver society is only in its second generation.
The veneer is thin.
Now, true aristocrats might accept you.
But here, you're a painful reminder of where they came from.
You're unschooled, and you're full of unharnessed enthusiasm and Denver isn't sophisticated enough to appreciate that.
Ah, we should have stayed in the hills where we belong.
May I make a suggestion?
Shoot, father.
Take a trip.
'A nice long tour of Europe.'
'You'll enjoy it and you'll acquire'
'a little polish.'
Polish.
Like what?
Learn something about art and music.
Learn manners.
Get a smatterin' of languages.
All that just to show
Mrs. McGraw?
Go ahead, father.
I'm learnin' already.
I've said enough.
I think you understand.
I'll say goodnight now.
Thanks for the advice, father.
You're right.
We sure are ignorant.
But we're gonna get schooled and harnessed and, and-and be second generation if it kills us.
It won't.
Goodnight, Molly.
- Johnny.
- Goodnight, father.
Thanks, again.
Look at it, Johnny.
Ain't it beautiful?
Pennsylvania Avenue,
I'll admit you gave me a nose full of splinters but it's all good wood from the very best doors!
Come on, Moll.
Now, we're going back to Leadville.
Never.
Oh, we ain't staying here where we're not wanted.
Johnny!
I can't go back to Leadville.
We gotta go one way or the other and ahead is better than back.
I know what's back there.
Ahead is something new.
Maybe better, maybe not.
But I got to find out.
We don't belong in Europe!
They'll split their satin britches laughing at us.

Uh, hear that, Mrs. McGraw?
The Browns are having a party!

Moll! Hey, we got a new friend.
And guess what.
He's a real live prince.
Oh, ain't that something?
Oh, 'cause look what I got and she's a grand duchess.
'Well!'
Howdy.
Howdy?
Oh! Oh-oh-oh, howdy.
[both laugh]
- Well, howdy.
- Howdy, madame
Ohh! Whoop-de-do!

Molly, dear, you are funny.
Here I'm funny.
In Denver,I'm vulgar.
I guess it's like, here you eat snails at home, we step on them.
[all laughing]
She has finally learned to eat snails.
Mmm. With this sauce, you could eat erasers.
[all laughing]
[indistinct chatter]
Thank you. Thank you.
Uh, thank you.
My, I, uh..
...I-I can't,
I can't find words.
You know that's unusual for me.
Uh...I want you to know
I appreciate how sweet you've been to I and J.J.
Uh...J.J. and me.
Me and J.J?
Well, anyway, as we say,
merci beaucoup!
- The candles, Molly.
- Oh!
[cheering]
Oh, thank you.
Oh...thank you.
Um, grazie.
Many happy returns, Molly.
Oh, you Frenchies sure are a kissy bunch of bananas.
[all laughing]
It's because we love you, Molly.
You've been a breath of fresh air, you know.
Oh! I'm a bag of wind, alright.
No, darling, it's true.
You're a stimulant to all of us.
You like everybody and everything.
I'm interested in everything
'cause I don't know nothin'.
That's not true, Molly.
Oh, but I'm learnin'.
I'm really learnin'.
I-I can, I can sit through the opera without going to sleep and, here you are, and I can paint a bowl of fruit that'll draw flies.
[all laughing]
And I can say
''hello'' and ''how much'' in ten different languages.
Hell, I'm, I'm just a hog for knowledge.
[all laughing]
Molly, what did Johnny give you for your birthday?
Ohh, something real sweet with a lot of sentiment attached.
A $300,000 in cash and a box of matches.
- Ohh!
- Oh!
Yes, he told us how you burnt the money in your little stove.
[all laughing]
Ecouter! Ecouter.
Oh!

It wasn't very nice of you to stay away from my birthday party.
You went without me.
I had to leave early with the Grand Duchess to arrange the place cards.
You said you'd join us.
I didn't think I'd be missed.
Not with the prince there.
In case you don't know, and I think you do he's gone on you.
Hmm, so what if he is?
That's the way in Europe.
- Hmm.
- You're in a mood.
I am?
You've been in a mood for days.
I sure have.
I'm going plumb crazy.
Oh, it ain't the prince.
I know that ain't serious.
It's just that I've had culture up to here.
I've drunk tea till my eyes are bubbling. Wine till I'm woozy.
I can't get the hang of their lingo and their manners.
I'm homesick for my own country.
- Do I get to talk?
- All the time!
- I got something to tell you.
- Ladies first, Mr. Brown.
I just wanted you to know
I-I thought it was time we went home.
Well, that's what
I was gonna say!
You-you ain't fooling me?
Mm-mm.
[laughs]
Colorado! Home!
I'll get the tickets tomorrow.
Oh, you better get about, uh, about ten of 'em.
- Ten of 'em?
- Mm.
I've invited the crowned heads of Europe to be our guests.
Tonight at the party I promised the grand duchess and prince we'd show 'em Denver.
'Of course, they have to bring along their friends'
'cause royalty don't even go to the shed unescorted.
How's that go again?
You're showing off Denver to the crowned heads or the crown heads off to Denver?
And Mrs. McGraw.
Mrs. McGraw? Humph!
I wouldn't give a widow's wart for Mrs. McGraw.
Mm, Molly Brown, you're either lying to me or to yourself.
When you gonna stop trying to be Mrs. McGraw?
You ain't got it in you to be like her.
I can be anything I want.
Maybe.
I liked the old Molly best.
Well, that's too bad, J.J.
'cause the old me ain't..
...isn't no more.
I've had a grand time putting the new me together.
And I'm sorry you don't take to us
'cause it was you who paid the bills.
I'm going to keep right on paying them, Chick-a-Pen.
'Cause I love you with a heart and a half.

Howdy, everybody.
Welcome. Glad to see you're here at last.
[indistinct chattering]
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mrs. Brown.
Good evening.
Oh, how do you do?
- How do you do?
- Oh, thank you for coming.
- I'm happy to be here, dear.
- Oh.
Good evening, father.
- Molly, you look beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.
And they're all here this evening.
Good evening. Ah..
Good heavens.
Look at this place.
It's frightening.
What period would you call it?
I'd call it the reign of terror.
Touch of red might help.
She likes red.
- Good evening, Roberts.
- Good evening, madam.
I figured I needed him a lot more than you did.
- Welcome, Gladys.
- Thank you.
You know Mr. Broderick, of course.
I don't know as I do.
Then let me introduce you to one of your guests, Mrs. Brown.
This is Mr. Malcolm Broderick of the Denver record.
Oh, how do you do,
Mr. Broderick?
- How do you do?
- You're the society writer.
Uh, I used to read your society talk every day.
Thank you, Mrs. Brown.
I hope you found it interesting.
No, but it was good practice for my reading.
I see.
And how do you find Denver after being away so long?
I don't know, mon ami.
But I'm going to find out.
One thing's for damn sure this time we ain't putting up with no rocky mountain rudeness.
We're second- generation now.
Oh.
Uh...may I quote you,
Mrs. Brown?
Uh, bet your bottom.
Write it all down.
And talk about your
Sacred Thirty-Six wait till you take a look at my royal flush.
Now, Roberts.
Shall we?
[fanfare music]
His Highness,
Prince Louis de Laniere.

- How-how-how do you do?
'Baron Karl Ludwig von Ettenburg!'
[Baron speaks in foreign language]
[Molly speaks in foreign language]
[Baron speaks in foreign language]
Ooh!
Oh, what a beautiful painting.
Is it one of yours, my dear?
Uh, yes, Herr Baron.
I have one of Mrs. Brown's paintings hanging in my schloss.
Guten abend. Guten abend.
That's his castle on the rhine.
- How do you do, Mrs. McGraw?
- How do you do?
Do you paint, my dear?
Uh, no.
What a pity.
How do you do?
Her Royal Highness the Grand Duchess
Elise Lupavinova!
You're supposed to curtsy, Gladys.
She's a royal highness.
[instrumental music]
Molly, dear, I've been admiring your magnificent piano.
I hope you'll play us some Chopin later on.
Do you play, Mrs. McGraw?
Oh, no, Duchess..
Uh, Your Highness.
Your royal, uh..
Roy-roy..
No.
- Sorry.
- What a pity.
How do you do?
Mrs. Buttercup Grogan!
Hello, Gladys.

Well, at last, this place looks lived-in.
- Good morning, Mr. Tobin.
- Mornin'.
Molly sure knew what she was doing when she made this place red.
The blood don't show.
You're a better man than I thought, Mr. Roberts.
You did fine last night.
Thank you very much, sir.
It's dreadful, simply dreadful!
You know, Mr. Broderick isn't a reporter.
He's an ignorant, spiteful barbarian.
But it's lies, all lies.
Everybody knows the Merry Christmas saloon ain't no fancy house.
And the things he quotes me saying all those blanks that stand for bad words.
Well, I guess I did let a couple go.
''One thing's for blank sure said Mrs. Brown.
''This time, we ain't putting up
''with no blank, blank rocky mountain rudeness.''
And worst of all, it ain't even on the society page.
It's on the sports page.
It isn't only Broderick, Molly.
It's all of your Sacred Thirty-Six.
They've been sending flowers and invitations to Louis, to me, and to the others.
But nothing for you and Johnny.
I've never known such uncivilized behavior.
Things were pretty uncivilized here last night..
...but it wasn't your fault.
[sighs]
Louis and I both think that we should go home as soon as possible.
- Yes.
- All of us.
You've outgrown Denver.
You cannot exist here, my darling.
The air is much too thin.
Sail with us on the next boat.
Oh.
You are not the same here, cherie.
You were free and happy in Europe.
Come back, let me make a happy world for you again.
Louis..
...let us go and tell the others.
'You all read in this morning's paper'
'about a free-for-all battle'
'that took place last night'
'in this million-dollar pile of rock.'
No!
No! I'll fix you!
...named ''Leadville''
Johnny Brown the guests were attacked by drunken miners.
It is generally known that although Mrs. Brown now buys her jewels by the bushel only a short while ago, she was a bar girl in a mining town saloon.
[gunshots]
[screaming]
Get out of here before I load up again!
Get out of here, you lying, stinkin' polecat!
Molly! Are you out of your skull?
Oh, they came sightseeing.
I'll give them something to see.
They ain't turning us into no side show!
Looks to me like you're making it a three-ring circus.
Firing out the window like a liquored-up redskin.
Liquored-up?
You're a fine one to be bellerin' about liquored-up.
You and your
Leadville friends.
Well, let me tell you something.
I wish we'd kept at it till we had this whole house tore clear to shreds.
I hate this place!
Good, because we're leaving.
We're going home to Europe.
No, we're going home, alright, to Leadville.
No, we are not.
I ain't living in Colorado.
The air is much too thin.
Then you'd better learn to breathe it
'cause we're living in Leadville.
- I'm living in Europe.
- You're my wife.
You live under the roof
I give you.
And it's gonna be in Leadville.
Don't talk so bossy,
Johnny Brown.
I got only one life to live and I ain't living it in Leadville.
Europe's been good to me.
I learned a lot.
And if you're too plumb stubborn or too plumb lazy or too plumb stupid to learn then the devil with you!
[dramatic music]
Maybe we're mismatched,
Mr. Brown.
What you and me want out of this life sure is different.
You don't know what you want.
You got rich too quick.
You-you're all mixed up.
I'm asking you for the last time.
You coming with me?
[music continues]
Alright. You go to Europe with your prince.
I'm not going.
I'm saying ''no'' to you at last.
No. No!

I ordered a Nebuchadnezzar of champagne.
Good thing he's a prince.
I sure couldn't afford a king.
[laughing]
With Molly, I am a king because she is a queen.
Well, a toast to our own queen
Molly, international Molly queen of the world.
Hear, hear.
[dramatic music]
Queen of the world..
...at last.
Queen of the world.
Here is my scepter.
Hmm. Here is my crown.
[crowd laughing]
I'm queen of the world so bow.
[crowd laughing]
I'm Molly Tobin, queen of the lard pail.
Bow.
Curtsy.
[music continues]
Well...drop my drawers.
It's Gladys McGraw.
Aren't you going to curtsy?
No, I guess you aren't.
And why should you?
I'm a vulgar, extravagant, ignorant
nouveau-riche
American expatriate.
Clowning for a bunch of people
I don't know and don't care about.
Just a figure of fun.
[music continues]
Nice to see you, Gladys.
[indistinct chatter]
And this is what I've become.
I guess last of all comes something you can't buy with money.
Last of all, it's just living with yourself.
Maybe I'm getting there.
Maybe that's where I'm getting.
Johnny used to say
''why don't you settle for happiness?''
But I thought happiness was all the things I was doing..
...was what I wanted..
...was what I dreamed of.
I don't know.
I don't know.
[sighs]
Seem to be saying that pretty often nowadays
''I don't know.
I don't know.''
A letter from Johnny.
''Dear Mrs. Brown, the time has come.
''You can take the ring off now.
''Sincerely...J.J. Brown.''
Hmm.
He can't even spell ''sincerely''.
But he was the one who taught me to read.
[Molly crying]
Oh. Oh, uncle.
[sobbing]
Uncle!
Uncle?
It's an old
American expression..
...for when you're down.
And I'm down.
I'm down real low.
[music continues]
You and I, Louis..
...we're just fooling ourselves.
Forgive me.
I know it's been rough on you.
I have tried..
...but it's against my nature.
Love is funny.
It's a lot harder to mine..
...gold or silver.
I had a rich claim..
...but I wasn't working it.
So-so I lost it.
[music continues]
Do you really believe he no longer means what he wrote inside this ring?
Inside the ring?
The inscription.
Didn't know there was an inscription.
Never had it off since the day he put it on.
Made me promise not to.
''Always remember two things
''that I love you..
''...and the name of the bank.''
[sobbing]
Maybe I...ain't down yet.
[instrumental music]
'Good evening. It's cold.'
[intense music]
[thud]
[foghorn blaring]
[siren wailing]
- Oh, my God. George!
- 'Mama! '
- George!
- Don't get excited.
- Now, now.
- We're all going to die.
Stop it!
Stop it! Sit down!
Sit down!
You're rocking the boat!
Stop yelling!
[sobbing]
We're going to die.
We're going to die.
No, we ain't!
I ain't ready to die!
Hell, I'm just learning how to live.
There you are, honey.
Now, you keep warm.
- Thank you, dear.
- Now stop crying.
You too, crying ain't gonna help.
Here. Take these.
Now, you hold on real tight.
Huh?
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
Oh, God!
Ladies and gent..
...did I ever tell you about the time
I was a bar girl in a saloon?
I sang a song and I'm gonna teach you now..
...and you're gonna learn all the words.
- Oh.
- You, too.
'We'll never make it.
We're gonna sink.'
Not with Molly Brown on board.
That ship may be down, but not me.
I'm unsinkable! No!
I survived the Colorado floods when I was six months old, so this is nothing.
So we're gonna be alright if we keep our heads.
Hey, let's sing!
[band music]
''Denver's heroine, our own Mrs. J.J. Brown
''who's now known throughout the world
''as the Unsinkable Molly Brown
''returns to Denver today.
''When interviewed
''during her triumphant week in New York
''she made light of her heroism despite the glowing reports
''from her fellow passengers.
''She said,''I sure as blank wasn't ready
''''for a blank, blank watery grave
''''so I just blank well
''''took the others along with me.''
''On her last day in New York
''the Unsinkable Mrs. Brown
''was decorated by the British government
''for her courage.
''When asked about the medal
''she said
''''a girl can always use

We're throwing a party for you to celebrate your homecoming.

Now, get out of them traveling clothes and get into a party dress.

You're a good sport.
Molly, you're quite a woman.
Hurry up now.
Molly, darling, you should see all the telegrams and flowers and letters and all.

No, but he was never much for writing letters, you know.
'Shamus!'
- Go on.
- Coming!
Hurry up, darling.

At that time, need a reserve ...
Yeah! The name is Hayward.
- A reservation is required ...
- Is Hayward!
Oil Hayward.
That Hayward!

Hello sir. Hathaway, pleasure to meet you.
Look Mr Hathaway, my bones are breaking through to know?
I need a soft place and nice to stretch them.

Very good!
Excuse me!
Hello! Everything under control?
Mr. Wayward ...
Oh yeah?
I think we found a place, sir.
Ordinance!
Follow Mr. Hayward the presidential suite.
Presidential suite?
Well, how did reservations ...
... Will have to serve.
Very nice, Mr Hayward,
I say, Mr Hathaway.
The bleachers were full ... and you could feel the electricity in the air.
Well .. it was the most exciting thing what ever happened to me.
I'll show you, can handle it?
Yes
Thanks.
Now, just imagine, here
... we're four.
Okay ... well at the start, accelerates a guy ...
... E. .. bam!
It's out of the race.
Now we are only three ... only three ...
... And suddenly ... bam! one of the boats go flying ...
... And there we were, just us two ...
... Just the two of us in the race ...
... Now I know it's time to leap ...
- Mr Jameson?
- Yes, Charlie?
I put the new propulsion and already put in the water, waiting for you.
Okay, I'm already there.
Well, ladies, I hate having to leave them ...
Do not go, finish the story.
Well .. to shorten the story ...
I won!
And I have also established a new record.
But now my passion, this is race so if you'll excuse me ...
... I'll take to Lady Scarlet
North Point and will regulate it.
And tightening may be anyone else that fits it.
Any takers?
I like to go.
Mr. Jamison ...
... Love getting tight.
Me too.
- Yes?
- I'm Tom Wilson ... Wilson.
Sorry Mr Wilson, we completely full.
I'm not looking quarter.
- Good!
- I am the new ski instructor.
Wilson! The input service is back there ...
Excuse me, Mr Hathaway.
- Is the new ski instructor?
That's right.
Want to make an appointment for a class tomorrow, Miss Carter?
Not tomorrow, now!
Mr Wilson only begins to work tomorrow.
Mr Wilson, as a special favor, could start their classes today?
I think so, I just have to find my room and leave it there.
Great! See you on the platform
Ski-... 5 minutes?
- In five minutes?
- Unless you arrive before!
Mr. Hathaway ...
Exactly where ...
North Point is?
Are you sure you need lessons?
Ohh yeah ... yeah.
I figured it would lose balance this time.
Yes I was lucky.
- She's a beauty.
- Yes it is.
Someone who knows?
Not yet.
What are you trying to do?
I can teach you anything else?
And then?
I was teaching you to keep balance and suddenly ...
... This boat and it appears begins to juggle ...
... As if one of profissisonal
Cyprens Gardens.
Where did you get that?
There is too much?
I knew that I would like ... 20 bucks!
Twenty bucks?
Never paid for it ...
- For a tie in my life!
- Until today!
The next time you want a tie, let me choose.
After all, the reputation is mine!
Yeah! Dude, I enjoy myself here.
Tonight, for example ...
... I have a meeting with a millionaire named Jamison.
May know, he is the jammies.
- What?
- Jammies.
You know, the parts girls wearing ...
.. And say they are sleepwear.
He is in them!
- He uses them?
- No! He who manufactures them.
The "Jammmies?
Is it once a year just come for the race.
And won the last three ...
... Which is no surprise, considering the boat he has.
It must be worth a fortune.
Does he have more money than me?
A red boat, great with tailpipes up ...
... And exiting the water ...
- Is the Scarlet Lady?
- Yes, you saw him?
This is the boat for which
Dianne was showing off.
Understood, it also is behind him.
So tonight
I am concerned ...
Your little joke ... this week it went nowhere.
Jamison jammies and I made other plans.
- Arrange the tie.
- Okay, thanks.
Sure, try it at home.
If you need anything, call room service ...
... And can sign on my behalf.
Thanks! Get out!
Mr. Jamison!
Hello Paul, the usual please.
J J Special right?
I was waiting.
Hey, Mr Jamison ...
... Want to ask something,
Here comes the year, right?
You know my wife is filling the bag, whatever you play ...
... You could get something from
Jamie settlement jammies?
I hate to ask, but you know ...
- His wife ...?
- Yes.
- Sure ...
- My wife, actually.
- Really?
- Yes!
Of course .. of course Paul, I ... I take care of it so back to New York.
- Thanks.
- Actually ...
... We have a new coming this year ...
... So soft, they do not know where
Jammies and just get the girl.
Forget it.
I already have six children, not need one more, right?
Ahhh ... it is!
How about something in flannel?
Flannel?
Yes ma'am, what will it be?
What is that?
What?
A J J Special.
Sounds interesting, or would better to say dangerous?
Depends on your mood.
It may be interesting or dangerous, or both.
Ohh .. I see.
In your case, I think would dangerously interesting.
"I'll take one.
- It's coming out.
Forgive my curiosity, but ...
... I have not seen before?
This afternoon, for example?
I doubt, I was skiing this afternoon.
So it was you!
Remember the boat race?
The Scarlet Lady?
- That was me.
- Really?
Was doing some maneuvers very good.
That was nothing.
Well .. I'm James Jamison, and you're ...
- Dianne Carter.
- How are you?
Hi friend!
Excuse me.
Gloria, this is J J Jamison.
- How are you?
- I am doing fine, sure.
J J Come, let us leave here and find something more exciting.
You're ready to go?
Ready, eager e. .. available.
Be right back.
We'll see.
Here we are.
- Hi
- Waiting for someone?
Not anymore.
Well .. if so ... can I?
Yes
Now, on to lesson ski this afternoon ...
I think I owe you an apology.
Okay, just do not do it again.
This is the first time
I'm in Miami.
The first night, and you, the first girl I meet.
I thought of a ride around, you come with me?
Why not? This seems it will be fun.
I paid, we'll see ...
- ... So if you switch.
- I switch?
Sure, pants are best to ride bikes.
Bike? You must be kidding.
Sorry, but this is your problem.
- Okay, see you ...
- Five minutes.
- Five minutes?
- Unless you arrive before.
Touché!
- How's it going?
- Very good.
Hey, come on!
I must be getting old.
Hey look, leave tomorrow work at 16 ...
... How about a boat?
- And there's this restaurant that ...
- No.
Tom, do not miss your time with me ...
... I am not rich, and my family is not rich.
- How so?
- Look, I understand ...
... You guys, come here for the season ...
... Housekeepers, lifeguards,
Ski Instructors ...
... All hoping to find a girl ... very very rich.
I understand, I was so obvious?
Ohh no ...
No. ..
... Is that one is able to recognize the other.
We are of the same type, you think I'm doing here?
For years, I've saved and
I saved up ... I pledge ...
... Half of my clothes are lent, and the other half ...
... Put labels Sack's, everything to be able to come here e. ..
And find a millionaire.
Okay, I admit ...
... I do not know why telling you that.
No wonder why he left me ...
... That's not in their plans.
I think it's because
I like you.
Besides, who knows, they may to let him jealous.
"He" is Jamison?
Yes
Maybe you need more ski lessons.
- Will you help me?
- Why not?
How you pay
I can repay the favor.
And who knows it ... may have a sister?
They say that, looking deeply a bonfire ...
... Sometimes, if you can see the future.
Well .. what you see?

I think we'd better go.
Is.
It is better that engine speed, he is very cool.
That boat was second last year.
Will not get anywhere this year, if it continues.
Listen to him.
You have a great ear.
- Am Burton Sam Burton.
-Tom Wilson.
I guess I never seen around here before.
I am a ski instructor from the hotel.
The way he spoke I thought were of any team.
No.. Just curious
I like boats.
We lost the last one race in south bend.
What happened?
It was an experimental model he was working on ...
... When it came to 140, began to vibrate ...
... The 150 began to unravel ...
... I could not handle it and entered into a pillar.
What a pity, perhaps better luck this year.
I'm not running this year ...
... Costs a lot to rebuild it with little hope ...
... That we can find what went wrong ...
... If you know of someone who wants buy a boat damaged ...
... Very cheap, have to my shop in Miami.
- And what would it be?
- Burton Boat Company.
Ohh! Sam Burton is that you?
- Nice talking to you.
- My pleasure, Mr Burton.
- Go with someone else?
- Hi
Come on, just to see our friend
J J going to the beach.
In this case, it is best to move.
But this time I'm riding.
- Are you ready?
- Accelerate.
Hey! Who is she?
- Funny ask ...
- Forget it, I'll find out.
Come on.
Quick, quick!
Let's reach.
Let's follow that boat!
- Take the girl!
- Go, go.
- Hi you guys!
"Hi honey, wait a minute!
Turn! Turn! Turn!
Wait for us.
Closer!
Hold hands!
Come on!
Easy! Easy!
No. .. no ...
Look!
Come on!
Are you okay?
No! Turn the other way!
- What is the problem?
- I lost the top!
Ohhh timing perfect!
Jamison has been swimming here!
Come back! Please come back!
Go away! Go away!
It was a really good trick who tried to ski.
There was a trick.
I lost my balance, can go away please?
Not only was the balance she lost!
This is what you seek?
Give it to me please.
No. .. not unless they promise will a drink with me at the hotel.
Okay, I promise! I promise!
Right.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
Look, can I help you?
No. .. you can let me
I turn myself thank you.
Turn around please.
Himself together?
- Yes, all right now.
- Come, let's get back on my boat.
- Okay.
- You could launch a new fashion.
- And what would it be?
- Water skiing, "topless" will go.
Can not blame a girl for wanting the finer things.
Scott, wait for me!
Come on! Was it something I said?
It's a long way back!
Here Flipper! Here boy!
The funny thing is that she thinks
I'm here ...
Speak louder Scott
I am a bit flooded!
The funny thing is that she thinks I'm here for the same reason she.
Pump and dump!
If she is so interested in money ...
... Why did not over me?
-Lots of competition.
- I think so.
It will be interesting to see how she will deal with the old J J. huh?
Of course, with Jamison there is only one way.
What's wrong?
Does it bother you?
No, that's his problem, not mine.
Hey kids!
Hey kids!
Calm down children!
Quiet! What's the matter little girl?
They think I'm fear of slipping.
Why not show they are wrong?
Because I'm afraid.
Come on, try.
- No.
- I'm right here and you get caught.
I can not.
I would be surprised by things you can do, just try it.

Ice cream for everyone "
It seems to have a knack for dealing with children.
I think it's the opposite.
Wilson, the handle of my skiing needs adjustment.
Fix it please? I think that compensate for the job.
I did think the Scarlet Lady for a ride.
We still have a luau that night.
I wonder, how you want to compete how all that money?
- One way would be to race.
- We temosum boat?
We have three ... but all are in Texas.
And with your salary, is precisely where they will stay.
Moreover, with the your bank balance ...
Hold on buddy, is not trying to prove something to yourself ...
... Without using your money?
Thanks, let's forget all that.
I just had an idea, I know where
I can get a boat!
- For 10 bucks?
- Ten thousand would be more appropriate.
Still, I would not have time to fix it for the race.
- We can see the boat?
- Sure, come on.
But I mean a thing to you guys ...
... Spent a lot of time and money on this boat ...
... The conditions in which it is now
I think just praying no way.
All he needs is reconstruction and a new engine.
Much money for you Tom
Unless your friend
Here's sponsor.
Well .. my checkbook is right here.
Just say, that I fill it up.
I'm tempted, but ... no thanks.
Why so sure ... that can solve the problem ...
... When my engineers say it is a hopeless case?
Not sure but ...
I would try.
You know, it has less than 2 weeks until race day?
Of course I know.
And yet both do it yourself?
Is.
I admire that.
The Orange Bowl regatta has
$ 10,000 as a prize ...
... If you win, we divided half and half, is that fair?
No kidding, are you?
No son, I'm not.
Hey, what about that buddy?
Okay, where would working on it?
Well .. at ...
... In store for skis hotel is good.
Okay, it's all yours.
- Thanks Mr Burton.
- Thanks.
Hey let's move it.
Maybe you can get before the luau.
- What is the problem?
- You said the magic word.
Luau?
Yeah!
Attention everyone!
Help yourselves while it's hot!
Lobsters, seafood, chicken, shrimp.
And bikinis too!

Hey, tell me one thing.
I saw the boat towing
Burton to the hotel ...
... Will turn it into a ski boat?
Not exactly, I think of fix it up for the race.
- Are you kidding me!
- Really?
Yes! That thing does not endured when she was young ...
... And do not improve with patches made by an amateur.
Well .. what I meant is that he is doing a bit of his post.
Why do not you do only you know?
You mean, do not mix.
You could say that.
Well .. thanks for the warning, but if you please do not follow.
I do not care, it will be good for laughs.
What about going a treasure hunt?
- Treasure hunt dear? Where?
- Do not know?
Outside, a pirate ship sank with many ingots ...
Chocolate?
Gold!
Sank during a hurricane some 100 years ago.
And still there?
They say that on clear nights, today, we can even watch it.
They say ...
- You can not ...
- Come I'll show you.
Right.
Hey! This is a good idea.
Why not let us search for treasure?
Okay.
You should get a girl.
Ask him has a sister?
Hey come on!
Hello Mr Burton.
I see you are working more than usual tonight.
Can not help it if we want those earning $ 10,000.
I would not mind ...
... Put much hope on that boat ...
... After 10 years of trying ...
... Thought I'd get to drawing that could win.
I think I got the error is not in the drawing of him ...
What do you mean?
The hull broke because protective covering gave ...
... Pressure, look, you can break it with your hands.
And it will happen again.
This is the best resin
I know.
There is nothing more robust market.
Mr. Burton, do me a favor?
Sure.
Hit as hard as you can.
- Crash?
- Sure, go ahead, knock!
O well!
What happened here?
It's called "GOOP" this is the abbreviation.
The technical name is longer.
Where'd you get that?
In a place where I worked,
I studied engineering ...
... And worked in a lab after I graduated.
Helped develop this hardener.
If it's so good, why is not in the market?
Not so good.
If exposed to water, turn gelatin is that exposure time is.
So what's the idea?
The company gave him, not me.
Mr. Burton?
Can I use your lab for some experiences?
I will work at night, so
I will not disturb anyone.
You. .. think you could work on it?
I do not know, but I would try.
My wife died long ago while we have had children ...
... Always felt for not having a son ...
... I do not feel much.
Just make sure you locked all before leaving, go to bed.
- Thanks Mr Burton.
- Good evening.
Coffee?
Need more cream and sugar.
What do you call that thing?
- Swingarm.
- Swingarm.
Distribution.
Carburetor, swingarm.
I know.
I suppose I have to find
Sally on 10 minutes.
- I'd better go.
- You can go.
- Thanks for the help.
-Let it go mate.
I think that from time to time, all rich man must come down ...
... And work side by side with their workers.
Very decent of you.
You look kinda tired.
Why does not rest the rest of the day?
Hey ... listen, I met a beautiful redhead ...
... Would save it for me but anything for a friend!
No thanks, I am very laboratory work.
You can check whether the package arrived yet?
First thing, if you're there, te mando quickly.
Or in French ... "done."
Hey buddy, there are only four day for the race.
Yeah, I know, thanks buddy.
- Hi Tom
- Hi Di.
I just saw Sally in the hall looking for you.
My goodness, this woman do not leave me alone!
And I love it!
Hi
Hi
- How's it going?
- How are you and Jamison?
Okay, I'll find it docks in a few minutes ...
... And a boat trip to the club where we will dine.
Sounds pretty romantic.
Elee very romantic.
But its proposals do not include a marriage.
Do not worry about it.
On a recent night, instead going to the club ...
... He's gonna ask to his room.
Will put some soft music ...
... And serve a perfect dinner.
Pheasant caramel ... of course!
And wine.
And dessert, let's see ...
Cherries Jubilee.
And after that ...
... Get there, you're in chat.
Tom, what's the problem?
Nothing.
Okay, I'll see ya.
Come here.
Clean.
Unless Jamison is blind ...
... Maybe he sees the trees, rather than the forest.
Thank you.

As director of research and development ...
... Is a function of my office to explore the advantages of diversification ...
... However, acquisition to diversify ...
... Is not a profitable venture.
Therefore, it is my strong recommendation ...
.. Accept the generous offer of
Allied Chemical's ...
... And surrender all searches, complete or not ...
... Formulas and data
Our ill-fated search ...
... By phosphate oxioctanóico glycolic.
You mean the "GOOP"?
Yes sir, was the what I meant.
If what was meant, then say, do not confuse me!
Ohh ... yes sir, no sir.
Mr Hayward ...
... Will return the bottles you asked for?
I include them in inventory.
You confused me again?
What bottles?
Remember? There are two
Ellie had days ...
... Get the formulas in which
Scott worked before ...
... To leave.
Those ...
Did what?
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Come here and sit,
I want to talk to you.
Do you know where my boy is?
Answer me woman!
Do you know where is my boy?
It's Friday night then you remain until after midnight ...
... Can not ski all day and work all night.
I think I'm more tired than I thought.
I met his friend at the hotel ...
... He told me he was waiting for that package.
Thanks.
He himself would bring, but her hands were busy ...
... I think in a Sally, and in another era, Ginger.
They are the latest formulas when was working in Hayward.
He worked in Hayward?
Do not remember what I said about the employment in the lab?
Ohhh yes.
Why she left there, if do I know?
No, okay, I quit, at least I think so.
I understand.
I mean, I really do not understand.
One day I'll tell you.
Fair enough, how's it going?
I'll know better when trying to
... a little of that.
Good luck.
- Oh hello Mr Burton.
- Hello Tom
It seems that need a hand.
- Need 10!
- Where do I start?
Get there in the front.
Just slide the brush, because it is quite easy to apply.
- This is it.
- Yes it is.
- Do you think this will work?
- I think it will do.
Think? You mean not tested yet?
I had no time takes 24 hours to harden.
We do not have much time before the race.
Neither spare time that could be wrong.
As I said the other day, must have confidence.
Hello gentlemen, as everything is going?
You know what time it is?
Partner does not pass inspection.
... Look mate, you had to be here two hours ago!
Something about "I promise to help"?
Hayward never return back on his word.
Your obedient servants!

Cigars ... cigarettes?
Cigars?
Can I help you sir?
- Well how are you ma'am?
- How are you?
- Okay.
- I asked if I can help you.
Ahhh! Yes ..
I suppose I like some of these cigars here.
I may be wrong, but you must be the father of Scott.
Hit on the fly!
Of course I am!
You know my boy?
Everybody knows his son.
I see that the two smoke the same brand.
It is ... what?
My boy has never smoked a cigar in his life.
He is my best customer.
Ohhh really?
So can you tell me where it was at this time of day?
I'd say ...
... In four minutes you can meet him at the bar.
I'll wait for it to pass.
At the bar?
Buying drinks for everyone.
The Florida weather makes things very strange to people.
He's ... uh ... smoke ...
... And drinking?
Anything else?
It seems that I got just in time.
Here's sweetness.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
It seems that the father is always the last to know.
 Cigarettes </ i>
 Cigars?
Cigarettes </ i>
- How are you?
- How are you?
A lady there in the south wing said I'd find ...
... A young man named Scott Hayward
Here setup, you know?
She spoke the truth, is his friend?
We can say that.
Then choose a drink, on his behalf.
For friends of Hayward, booze!
What a beautiful phrase.
But it is not uncomfortable, just want to a dose of your best whiskey.
We can expect
Mr Hayward together.
I know you?
My name is Burton, the Burton Boat Company.
In three years, his company wanted swallow mine, remember?
Of course! I remember now.
What happened? Thought had an agreement.
We had, until his hard head beat with my stubbornness.
My boy loves boats, then wanted to give him ...
... As one of its birthday.
I do not know what he would do.
You appear to have all it needs.
Money to burn women lives only for today.
Wait, Mr. Burton, one minute please ...
... What's wrong with everyone here?
You know who this is?
Why, certainly, is not describing my boy.
Seeing is believing.
Well. ... Well and if I knew what there is to see, maybe I believe.
- Your boy Scott, right there.
- Where?
There! There he is!
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute ...
... That mean ... boy is your son?
You bet ... sir.
He is the hotel's ski instructor,
His name is Tom Wilson.
I have no idea what is drinking cup in there ...
... But one thing
I ceretza ...
... I know my own son.
Mr Hayward, I'd better a little chat.
After Mr. Burton, if not
I want to care ...
No, now!
It's about your boy.
Let ...
Partner ... was waiting.
I want to meet someone.
This is Gigi.
Gigi, this is "monsieur" Wilson, is my best friend.
Although it is poor.
- How are you?
- Enchanted "monsieur" Wilson.
She speaks no English, I teach you everything I know.
- Oh really?
- About English.
Please join us, Tom
Yes, sit down, we are very democratic.
Thanks.
- Want to dance?
- Yes.
What says Dianne?
You will love the view in my suite. and put a pretty mellow song, serve a J J Special ...
- ... A breast of pheasant ...
- Caramel?
Sure! And a good wine.
And then, of course ...
... My favorite dessert.
Cherries Jubilee.
How did you guess?
Women's intuition, I get my purse.
Well, good night all.
See you tomorrow.
If you'll excuse me,
I'm saying goodbye.
Wait a second there.
You know what that means?
Yes, it means "goodbye and good luck to my head. "
- Tom
- Mr Burton.
- Collecting up early?
- Is.
- Have a good night and sleep well.
- I will try.
- It's not going to check it out on the boat?
- I checked a few hours.
One last time will not hurt.
Never know what you can find, if very meticulous.
You better take a look, do it for me.
I'll look.
He knew that entered this boat race tomorrow.
Father!
- Do you think wins?
- I hope.
One such said Sam Burton who will share the prize, right?
It's great to see you, Dad.
Do not jump to conclusions.
He also said he did all the work yourself.
- Is it true?
- Almost all.
Do you think he will hold this time?
I think.
He is eager to take chances, go there tomorrow ...
... Maybe kill himself, to find out?
It is, to find out.
Finding out about myself, see if I can.
You know what Dad?
I would trade all that has gave me for one thing.
- Why trust me.
- What are you saying son?
I've always trusted, just tried facilitate things a bit.
That father, do not want to facilitate.
I make my own errors and fix them ...
... Before you press the shutter button panic, as it did in the factory.
Well ..
... Enough of this chatter emergency button on ...
Trust ... and stuff!
Now I will hear a second young fellow!
His firm spent, from night to day ...
... 1 million dollars in "GOOP" or
"Gook," or what you call ...
... And we could not make it work.
And now tell me who will leave with this boat tomorrow ...
... Win, lose, sinking, stand if this thing ...
... Then have gone ahead eprovado something?
That's right!
Let me tell you something, whether you like it or not.
I want you to know that ...
... I'm so proud of you as a father who has never ...
... Botado both feet in that was freaking my God. "
Thank you father.
I think we've solved this very well, no?
I'm feeling a little tired.
How about with me back to my hotel?
We will be glad father.
What a beautiful room!
Very exotic.
Have to be.
It is called the Sultan's suite,
I get it every year.
Where guarding his harem?
Where did you get a idea like this?
As we ...
I agree that I have acted middle playboy ...

James will have a big day tomorrow.
And a great night tonight.

Hi Mr. Burton! Good luck today,
I know it will win.

Ahhh it? You're rich too huh?
Well, how are you?
My name is Hayward ...

Is it? Very pleased Mr Hayward, that honor to meet you ...
Also deal with ... oil is not known.
Take a cigar.
Okay, thanks, what about taking a mine?
Well thank you .. for his kindness.
Funny you know ...
... I think I met your daddy.
And you? Know Daddy?
How wonderful!
A great gentleman, what's your name sir?
My name?
Lord ... I ... I do not believe who has heard his name.
Ohhh yeah ... Hayward.
Duster ...
W. Hayward ...
Son!
Are you alright boy?
I swallowed my cigar?
Never mind, here
Get one of mine.
No, no, no, you
Duster Buster smoke ... ...
... Get it, I some cigars ...
... Take all, keep it!
Ohh the race, gotta go!
Bye dad!
Be careful, now the engine is running!
Now the helicopter  race is coming ...</ i>
 ... is positioning itself for end of the warmup lap ...</ i>
 ... just missing some seconds for the race. </ i>
Pass me the popcorn.
 The last driver ever positioned for the start ...</ i>
 ... and there they are
Ladies and gentlemen ...</ i>
 ... the cream of hazardous boat racing ...</ i>
 are holding the positions ...
4 km past us ...</ i>
 ... and nearing the start, the director is in the helicopter ...</ i>
 ... so the boats are positioned ...</ i>
 ... it will trigger the signal who will start the test. </ i>
 And there it is </ i>
 ... a clean start
Ladies and Gentlemen </ i>
Cobra  wide in front ...</ i>
... George is  Gergo right behind him ...</ i>
 ... and Fred Whiting, in 1996, will pasted on his back ...</ i>
 are in the first round and
Cobra maintains its leadership ...</ i>
This is Jeff  Cassey, number 15, trying to force the excess ...</ i>
 ... think about Copper Rourke and comes right behind Roy Bubbles ...</ i>
 ... approaching ... and here comes J J Jamison </ i>
He can overcome 
4 at a time </ i>
 It comes with everything ...</ i>
 ... surpassed Roberts ...</ i>
 ... is now in fourth place ...</ i>
And now the third  </ i>
 ... and is coming close to Whiting ...</ i>
 ... and beyond </ i>
 now tries to ... near Snake ...</ i>
 ... and does! Lady Scarlet leads the way </ i>
 Undoubtedly, J. J. Jamison more since the emphasis is </ i>
 The other boats are well together, no challenge in sight. </ i>
There goes the  Rawhide!
Tom Wilson is firm </ i>
 You float through the ... </ I>
 ... and now out of the turn ...</ i>
 ... he cuts the right and tries to overcome Whiting ...</ i>
 ... and there it goes!
Rawhide is third </ i>
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Come on, come Rawhide!
 One more lap and Scarlet Lady is still in the lead. </ i>
Cobra  second ...</ i>
 Rawhide keeps coming </ i>
Let Rawhide!
 appears that Jamison wants sure you do not pass. </ i>
 will reach the limit. </ i>
Wilson goes on 
Cobra now. </ i>
Will try to  overtake on the straight. </ i>
Wilson  decreases the distance ...</ i>
 ... closer ...</ i>
 closer ... and beyond </ i>
 Wilson is now in second, behind Lady Scarlet. </ i>
 The last lap exceeded 150 km / h. </ i>
 same speed over
Rawhide with last year. </ i>
 The question is: will history repeat itself? </ i>
Jamison keeps  same speed. </ i>
 Wilson continues on his back. </ i>
Come on!
 Wait a minute! It seems that Wilson is having some kind of problem. </ i>
Scarlet Lady  increases your advantage
Rawhide is located on the front and back. </ i>
 Cobra takes second place. </ i>
Wilson seems to have  solved the problem. </ i>
 Recovers your speed now. </ i>
 will exceed the Cobra. </ i>
 back into second place </ i>
 Beware! Jamison should be about 160 kph! </ i>
 It forces the boat to the extreme </ i>
 and Wilson want to stay with him, must impose the same pace. </ i>
 Remember, it is the same hull broke ...</ i>
 last year with ... much less speed. </ i>
Can the hull reconstructed  stand this year? </ i>
 Backing,
Ladies and gentlemen ...</ i>
 ... if Rawhide withstand pressure ...</ i>
 can handle everything .... </ i>
 The question now is: can he achieve Scarlet Lady </ i>
 there are less than two laps </ i>
 Entering the final lap,
Jamison continues to lead. </ I>
Come on Tom!
Come on Tom!
Rawhide, go, go!
 are exiting the last corner, the banner is ready. </ i>
Come, come friend!
Come on, come on!
 And he does!
Rawhide wins </ i>
 We have a new champion
Ladies and gentlemen ...</ i>
 ... a true champion!
Tom Wilson in his first race ...</ i>
 ... steals the victory of the man who won here the past 3 years </ i>
Congratulations to Tom Wilson!
The award will be tonight ...
... In the great hall of the Hotel Shores.
You did it!
Got it!
Man that boat!
To see you ripping up the last curve,
I swore that you were born for this!
Time of celebration!
Yeah!
His father is really proud.
Need to see it distributed cigars as a first-time parent ...
... And bragging.
And Sam Burton said ...
... The "GOOP" will be the most successful market, since their bikinis.
- Your health friend.
- On your own, buddy.
Something wrong?
No, I'm just expecting a call.
You may have to receive trophy at dinner tonight.
Now wait a minute!
No sir, no! You won the trophy and will welcome you!
He proved what he wanted, it's time to back to being what we are.
Also, I wonder if
Sally loves me for who I am or ...
... For your money.
I know what you
I mean, friend.
She's ready to go now!
Thanks Harold, to hold there.
Give me the keys.
- What's happening?
- I'll explain later.
- Now wish me luck!
- You are desired.
Thanks buddy.
Harold can please hurry?
I need a taxi.
Never been to Connecticut?
No, a taxi!
Does it have to go? A taxi?
- There it is!
- Taxi Miss?
Jump up, take you where you want to go, courtesy of Scott Hayward.
Wish you did not go away today.
In these circumstances I think is better.
And I expected to get help to spend the prize.
Thanks, but should retain money and not spend it with me.
Too late, already spent!
Tom!
Tom Wilson you have to return this ring to the store!
Does that mean marry me?
I mean, not we, I mean ...
... This ring would pay the rent a year plus expenses, plus ...
So you're saying that marry me?
Of course I'll marry!
Dianne, I must confess something.
- About what?
- About my family.
I'm marrying you, not with his family.
Well .. about me being ski instructor.
Look dear, listen ...
... With winning and with the
I win, we'll be okay ...
... Just can not afford stuff like this ring ...
... The more I wished we could.
You see that oil field there?
Got a tenfold when I was 21 years.
Ten times?
You see that yacht?
I won one just like the my last birthday.
You know what I think?
I think I drive the car of Scott
're doing you have delusions.
That's what I'm saying.
- What?
- It's who I am.
Who?
I'm Scott Hayward.
And I'm Fiegledopper Hortense, wants to talk seriously, please?
Look .. see for herself.
Well, it all started on the way here,
I stopped at this restaurant ...
... Where I met Scott ...
Tom, Tom the real ..
Dianne ... Dianne, are you okay?
Sorry to be rich.
If I said something that hurt you.
I swear I can explain everything.
Like I said, I stopped in one of my posts ...
I mean ... our posts ...
... And while I fill the tank,
I went to get coffee and a sandwich ...
... That's where I met Scott, or rather, Tom ..
THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT
Screenplay, Dialogue, and Songs by
JACQUES DEMY
FRIDAY MORNING
Set up here?
That’s all for today, children.
Good-bye, ma’am.
And don’t forget your costumes tomorrow.
Delphine, come look.
They’re here.
They’re setting up on the square.
The girls won’t be ready.
We’ll rehearse Sunday.
- No need to.
- Think so?
We are a pair of twins
born in the sign of Gemini
Mi fa so la mi re
Re mi fa so so so re do
We’re two demoiselles
who took to the boys long ago
Mi fa so la mi re
Re mi fa so so so re do
Our mama
brought us up on her own
Working herself all her life
to the bone
To make sure
our minds could expand
She’s spent all her time
behind a French-fry stand
Papa was somebody
that we never knew
But when we undress
one thing is true
In the small of our backs,
in the very same place
There’s the same beauty spot
he had on his face
We are a pair of twins
born in the sign of Gemini
Who love catchy tunes,
silly puns, and repartee
We’re a pair
of carefree young things
Waiting for the joys
that love brings
- When our blood races
- When our heart stops
We’re ready to shout it
from the rooftops
We are delicate souls,
two romantics
In love with art,
music, and antics
Where’s that man?
The man we long to find
Mr. Right. . .
A few faults we won’t mind
We are a pair of twins
born in the sign of Gemini
With our feet on the ground
we have flights of fantasy
Teaching piano
is making me turn pale
I’ve had it up to here
with the sound of bad scales
I’m bored
with these provincial ways
It’s Paris for me
where art really pays
Dancing lessons
are starting to get me down
My chance is in Paris too,
not in this town
Why teach pliés
and pirouettes all day
When I could be
in the Opéra Ballet?
We are a pair of twins
born in the sign of Gemini
Two hearts, four eyes
ready to rhapsodize
Quarter to 12:00!
I’m late.
Delphine, pick up Booboo?
- Can’t you?
- I’ll go at 4:00.
I can’t wear this!
Sure, I can... No, I can’t.
Guillaume will be waiting.
- What’s he want?
- To see me.
Let him wait.
You coming home for lunch?
Yes, but not before 1:00.
Where’s my compact?
Here it is.
We play the cello,
the trumpet, and the banjo
We love catchy tunes,
silly puns, and repartee
With our feet on the ground
we have flights of fantasy
We are a pair of twins
born in the sign of Gemini
See you later.
- Where you off to?
- The café.
Wait for us.
Fries?
Two orders of fries.
- Fair time?
- We just arrived.
- It’ll boost business.
- No need for that.
- We’re going for a walk.
- Not now!
We’re not on call.
What slackers!
- How you treat your ladies!
- They aren’t our ladies... not really.
Performers?
The blond does an Indian shimmy, the redhead a Chinese shimmy.
- It’s harder.
- How interesting.
He’s the boss.
I’m his right-hand man, a mechanic.
- Hello, Yvonne.
- Hello, Maxence.
Hello, Josette.
Hello, Gramps.
- Still abstract?
- More than ever.
He was born that way.
In three days I’ll be discharged.
- A Clacquesin.
- We’re out.
Aren’t we?
- But he can order something else.
A beer.
- So did you find her?
- Not yet, but I can wait.
A beer for Maxence.
- Did he find her?
- Not yet.
- What’d he lose?
- His feminine ideal.
He never found her to begin with.
He painted her. He’s a painter-poet.
He’s stationed here.
We all seek our feminine ideal.
He’s not the only one.
Don’t be so sad, Maxence.
Girls are a dime a dozen.
I’ve searched all over for her
I’ve sailed the seven seas
From Venice to Java,
from Manila to Angkor
There was Jeanne and Victoria,
Venus and Mona Lisa
I haven’t found her yet
I seek her even more
I don’t know what she’s like
and yet her image is clear
I have a name for her
Her voice is in my ear
I’ve sketched her silhouette,
the face I’m dreaming of
The portrait that I’ve done
is the very image of love
She is as gracious
as only romantic girls can be
A Botticelli beauty
with such eyes, such poise
In profile she’s like
those virgins of mythology
Who haunt museum galleries
and the dreams of teenage boys
Her stride is so much like
a childhood memory
That passes before my mind’s eye
lilting, dreamily
Her hair pours down her brow
like torrents of pure gold
Round which wind, sea, and sun
quarrel for a hold
I could tell you
of her hands, of her eyes
I could go on and on
until the next sunrise
She is my only love,
but what good is a dream?
I’ve searched all over,
but she’s nowhere to be seen
He could tell us
of her hands, of her eyes
He could go on and on
until the next sunrise
She is his only love,
but what good is a dream?
He’s searched all over,
but she’s nowhere to be seen
Can she be far?
Or is she close to me?
I couldn’t say,
but I know she does exist
Is she a wicked girl?
Or born to royalty?
Her pedigree means nothing,
because I am an artist
And love is the sole authority
N ice portrait, but no one like that here.
- No, no one.
- I prefer redheads.
- Heavens! Have you seen Delphine?
- No, ma’am.
I bet she forgot to pick up Booboo.
Could you go, Maxence?
I’m already late for maneuvers.
I have to set the tables.
- I’m sorry.
- Never mind.
Bye, Gramps.
Could you two gentlemen go?
The school’s just around the corner.
Sure, we don’t mind.
You’re sweet.
Just ask for Booboo.
- Who?
- Booboo. He’s my son, my youngest.
I’m afraid I can never get out.
I’m confined to this aquarium.
Me, who was meant to live in the open air on the Pacific shore... listening to sweet music and reading poetry.
Yvonne, I’m out of glue.
Could you buy some glue on the way? Thanks.
Hi, Delphe!
You’re filthy! Look at you!
And in your new pants!
- Are you Booboo?
- Why do you ask?
We came to pick up Booboo.
- Says who?
- The lady in the café.
- What nerve!
- We’re on the up-and-up.
We came with the fair.
I bet you did.
- You’re quite pretty.
- So I’ve been told.
- You’ll split your dress.
- Quiet.
So do we take the kid?
- I wanna go with them.
- Are you kidnappers?
- We wouldn’t say if we were.
- Smart aleck!
Actually, it suits me fine, because – never mind.
Behave yourself.
Bye, pumpkin.
- Your aunt’s swell.
- She’s my sister.
She’s a honey!
I want some candy.
We gonna stand here all day?
Hello, dear rose.
You’re lovely, dear soul.
- By "soul" you mean my body.
You’re so right, dear heart.
If I weren’t so in love with you,
I’d be jealous.
But I love you, and that fills me with pride... and craving, since I want you.
I inspire your baser feelings.
And gluttony and lust.
And prattle.
You love to hear yourself talk.
Myself and yourself.
I love you.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
You don’t love me, but you’ll marry me.
I already said no, Guillaume.
- Then why do you come?
- You’re so entertaining.
But if you prefer,
I’ll stop coming.
Why, that’s me!
Yes, dear rose.
Since when do you pose for soldiers?
Soldiers?
What’s this nonsense?
Who painted that?
- I told you: a soldier.
Calls himself a painter and poet.
Get the picture? Know him?
- An uncanny likeness, don’t you think?
- Mere coincidence.
- But it’s me all over!
- No, it’s just figurative.
You’re spiritual, dear soul.
It’s a worthless picture, pure fantasy.
He modestly calls it
Feminine Ideal.
He must really love me to dream me up like this. What’s he like?
Dull, insignificant.
I want to meet him.
Sorry. He just left for Paris.
But he’s not your type at all.
You think you know me
You like to talk a lot
But really you do not not not...
You don’t know how I feel
If you did know, you’d reel
You’ll never know
I know how you think
You’ll never know
what tickles me pink pink pink
What makes me play
or why I dream night and day
I’m just a doll in your gallery
What did you ever see in me?
You find my chatter
tedious and dumb
You couldn’t care less
if I’m cheerful or glum
Doubts are something
you don’t show
I’m a fool,
whether I say yes or no no no
You say, "I live only for money"
and then you say you love me
If you really loved me. . .
But I tell you every day –
If you really love me
as you say say say
When you tire of me, you say,
"Excuse me, time is money! "
But time for me is love,
my friend
It’s laughter and song
until the day’s end
And love each night
since creation
Time is love
Life is celebration
So. . . so stop thinking
I’ll be your prize
You lie when
you sentimentalize, lies, lies. . .
Buy other girls a drink
You’ll find love for the price of a mink
Then you’ll forget me
- It’s simpler than you think
- Any girl will give you a wink wink wink
It may be a girl with velvety voice,
but love for her is on an invoice
Excuse me for being so blunt
I won’t put feelings up front
Let’s not drag it out for both our sakes
Let’s make it a friendly break
Farewell, Guillaume.
Good-bye, dear heart.
Your eyes are the same blue as in that picture.
- I can’t help it.
- Aren’t they?
You like blue eyes, so you can tell.
I’ve never seen anything like them.
How odd! It can’t be abstract if it resembles his eyes.
Which aren’t abstract, so that picture sees you as I do...
Look, Mom.
- You shouldn’t have!
- It’s nothing.
Thanks.
- Here you go, Gramps.
- How kind of you.
- Will you have a drink?
- Why not?
We met a knockout blond.
- Your sister.
- I don’t have a sister.
- He means Delphe.
- Delphine... my daughter.
- She’s a peach.
- So are you.
So I’ve been told.
S.O.S.! Storm at sea!
Be quiet, Booboo.
Hello, Dutrouz.
Hello, everyone.
They’re friends.
Subtil Dutrouz.
"Subtil" like a scent,
Dutrouz with a silent Z.
- Bill as in "billiards."
- Etienne, like everyone else.
- Here, for you.
- What is it?
A plastic atomic submarine.
- How’s it holding?
- Fine.
That’s good.
I just saw them tramping by, armed to the teeth.
They’d shoot us like rabbits.
- What’ll you have?
- Nothing. I’m off.
I’ll be back later.
- Who’s that?
- A friend of Gramps’.
- What’s he do?
- He’s retired.
- What exactly do you do?
- Us?
We go from place to place
with motorcycles to sell
Bikes and boats as well
The road’s our home base
- Today we’re here
- Tomorrow there
We live free as the air,
like boys without a care
On the move, having fun,
avoiding shadows for the sun
We prefer
what is sweet, not sour
A pretty girl,
not a wallflower
And pleasure, not despair
We flit from face to face,
like bees among the flowers
In every port a pretty girl,
in every town some tender hours
We live on the heady brine,
a baker’s loaf, a sip of wine
The morning haze,
the evening storm
A child’s smile to make us warm
The siesta at midday
Making love in the hay
The wind on our face
We go from town to town
The future’s an unknown
A pretty girl lends a hand
and life is grand
- Today here
- Tomorrow there
Our life’s a romance,
a melody composed by chance
Full of new delights
We prefer joy to misery
Intelligence to stupidity
Straight talk to hypocrisy
And gentle arms to gendarmes
We go from fair to fair
Folks point and stare
They call us carnies,
but poets are what we are
- Today we frown
- Tomorrow laugh
Life’s a double bill,
a tragedy of fate
A comedy of good will
As friends we will grow old
Knights without fear or blame
We haven’t a penny to our name
But our hearts
are made of gold
We go from place to place,
across rivers and valleys
They call us carnies
The road is our home base
- What’s wrong?
- I’m sad and bored.
You’re hiding something.
It’s over with Guillaume.
That’s good news.
I never liked the guy.
Know what I’m thinking?
Yes, about your dream man.
How’d you guess?
It’s simple, darling.
You have that "dream man" look on your face.
I know nothing of him
and yet his image is clear
I have a name for him
His voice is in my ear
Often, when I dream,
I see the face I’m thinking of
The look in his eyes
is the very image of love
He is handsome
as only romantic men can be
Like divine Raphael,
his talent is heavenly
A philosopher
in love with democracy
And a poet
who rhymes endlessly
I could tell you
of his hands, of his eyes
I could go on and on
until the next sunrise
He is my only love,
but what good is a dream?
The illusion of love
is only love unseen
Is he near or far?
Could he be in Rochefort?
I’m sure to meet him
I know he does exist
Whatever reason says,
my heart tells me more
Its reign, its law
is something one can’t resist
And resist I never will
Sweetie, guys like that don’t hang out in Rochefort.
Not right now.
He’s in Paris. He did my portrait.
Who is it?
You never mentioned him.
A painter.
I don’t know him.
He exists, and he loves me.
But I’ve never seen him.
- You’re ill.
- I’m serious.
- To Paris, then!
- And our pupils?
- Our careers first.
- Without money?
Never mind that.
For now we’re free.
We leave for Paris next week.
This afternoon
I’ll go see Mr. Dame –
What’s so funny?
Nothing.
That’s such a silly name.
He’s very nice.
And he knows Andrew Miller.
- Who’s that?
- I don’t know.
An American composer.
They went to school together.
Andrew Miller is giving some recitals in Paris, and Simon Dame will tell him about me.
I mean, in a letter.
Then I’ll get Booboo.
No need to.
Mom sent two guys this morning.
I went for nothing.
Booboo left with them.
You let Booboo go off with two strangers?
The town’s crawling with soldiers, sadists, and unknown painters!
You’ll never get a man, old girl.
You were born 12 minutes later, so don’t "old girl" me! As for men –
That’s it!
- What?
I’ve got the theme for my concerto!
Good day, sisters.
Schubert’s "Ave Maria."
Here we are.
- Is that all?
- Yes, thank you.
Good-bye, Mr. Dame.
- Hello, Mr. Dame.
- Hello, miss.
Your music paper arrived.
I’m sorry about the delay.
Setting up this store has taken a lot out of me.
Rochefort isn’t Paris, and I haven’t adapted yet.
It looks really nice.
I’ve tried to recreate a musical atmosphere.
Now, where did I put it?
Here it is.
Ready for the fair?
- The girls rehearse daily.
I wrote a little piece for them, a three-part chorale in C minor.
How much is it?
Twelve francs.
Please call me Simon.
Really?
My name’s so silly.
I’m called Solange.
The key of so and the flight of angels.
The name suits you.
I have a favor to ask.
Go ahead.
I plan to go to Paris next week.
You hinted last Tuesday that you could recommend me to your friend,
Andrew Miller, the composer.
Andy? Certainly.
I haven’t seen him since conservatory days.
After school
Andrew went back to the States and found fame and fortune.
Life’s come between us.
You’re in luck – he’s in France.
I’ll write to him right away.
I’m sure he can help you.
You’ll become a great composer,
Solange. A great composer.
I hope so.
I have the third movement for my concerto in F sharp minor.
Would you care to hear it?
- With pleasure.
Admirable!
What texture, originality, passion!
What force! What lyricism!
I like it a lot too.
- When do you leave?
- Monday, after the fair.
Please don’t take this the wrong way... but when my fiancée left 10 years ago,
I felt the same twinge in my heart.
Your fiancée?
It was because of her that I left Paris.
I moved here last month to relive my memories.
Does she live in Rochefort?
No, Mexico.
But we met here.
It’s an unusual story for an ordinary man like me.
My fiancée
found my name a bad joke
I think it even shocked her,
and one day I awoke
To find she’d left me
without a word, without a sign
I haven’t laid eyes on her
in 10 years’ time
She had told me
one night so tenderly
That we were soon to be
no longer two but three
It fills a man with pride
It’s woman’s greatest claim
But she couldn’t stand
being called Madame Dame
Yet she cared for me
and I called her my muse
But I had no idea –
how poets will be amused! –
That a name like mine
could shame and irritate
I didn’t understand
until it was too late
I was a handsome fellow
and she a sweet young thing
She hadn’t planned it
but had already mothered twins
I never met the girls,
who were always out of sight
They went to boarding school
and never came home at night
A few years later
I met a mutual friend
Who told me some foreigner
had married her in the end
And taken her away
to a place in Mexico
To live romantically
in a seaside bungalow
So here I am alone,
a lover in despair
I came to see this city
since I’d met her here
I decided not to leave
and here I plan to stay
Living with my memories
and my heart at bay
- You never saw her again?
- Never.
She must be living it up in Acapulco.
She worshipped the sun.
Here I am going on and on!
I’ll write to Andy.
I hope he hasn’t forgotten me.
- Maybe he got a swell head.
- What?
He may be pretentious.
No, Andy was a bright fellow.
I’m sure you’ll like him.
4:00 already!
I doubt she’ll come.
The kid can’t walk home alone.
Excuse me.
Let the young lady by.
- Hi, Solange.
- Hi, pumpkin.
Your slip’s showing.
Fighting again! Look at you!
You naughty boy!
- Hi, Booboo.
- Ah, you’re here?
- What do you want?
- We’ve come to pick up Booboo.
These are my buddies.
We’re here with the fair.
- When do you leave?
- Monday.
Then bon voyage!
Miss, your slip is showing.
So I’ve been told.
Your aunt’s not very nice.
She’s my sister.
She sure has changed.
Come on, skip it.
They buy me candy.
I’ll get you licorice.
I want to go with them!
Then no licorice!
I’m sorry.
Don’t mention it.
- Are you a musician?
- Yes.
Good-bye.
Miss, your slip is showing.
I know, but it doesn’t matter.
Miss... may I see you again?
I don’t know.
I don’t think so.
Come on.
That guy’s got some nerve.
Say, that’s in G minor!
I’m in love, I am
Lucky you!
I do what I can
I come to Rochefort
to see a friend
Simon Dame,
he lives out this end
But I meet a girl
and I go crazy
The girl’s gone
but love’s fazed me
It took a trip
across two continents
It took
this one amazing chance
To change my life
and give it sense
It took my coming back
to France
- Ready?
- We can’t go without saying good-bye.
My heart’s racing.
- That’s normal.
Look: First, I’ve had it.
Second, they exploit us.
Third, I don’t love Etienne.
Fourth, Bill’s eyes aren’t blue.
Fifth, adventure beckons.
And sixth –
Here they come.
What’s with you?
Can’t you see?
We’re leaving.
- What?
- We’re leaving.
- With who?
- Two sailors.
Don’t whine. It’s pointless.
They’re dumb.
We love them, but that’s not the worst.
We give them a golden opportunity, and they cut out before a show.
And for who? Sailors!
Sailors give us a better time
than all your carnies combined
- Sailors aren’t the marrying kind
- But as lovers they’re just fine
As friend, lover, or husband,
sailors are absent all the time
Chance often does things right,
but it got its wires crossed
With the faded roses it tossed
on the bed of our lonely nights
Well, if our bed of roses
is now just full of thorns
And your heart is now sea-born,
what can I say or propose?
Shall I shoot you and mourn?
Or die broken and morose?
You had what it takes to please:
your nose, mouth, brow, and hair
If only your eyes were blue
I could have died for you
If my eyes, dear marquise,
are not worth dying for
And a sailor boy can offer more,
what can I say to please?
Should I go down on my knees?
Should I die of jealousy?
You mustn’t hold a grudge
or I’ll get all teary-eyed
My makeup is going to smudge
I’m already bleary-eyed
My makeup is going to smudge
I’m already bleary-eyed
Fly away, turtledoves
Get along to your tropics
Since our eyes are not topics
to make you melt with love
Go on then, my lovelies
Good sailing and good loving
You thought it over?
We flit from face to face
like bees among the flowers
Today we’re here,
tomorrow there
For us life’s a cinch
Braque, Picasso,
Klee, Miró, Matisse – that’s life!
Sure, life!
But how do you manage?
Don’t tell me you paint in the barracks.
No one paints in barracks.
I have a room in town.
It’s my studio.
Every night I go AWOL, and I go home and paint.
Next week I go to Paris, and in six months, a show.
- If you’re released.
- That’s not funny.
There’s trouble everywhere, like in ’39.
That’s how it started in ’39.
I saw you this morning doing your clown act.
We were on maneuvers.
Think I enjoy it?
Cut it out!
Next week I’m a civilian.
Freedom!
Monday.
Right, Yvonne?
It’s sad to see everyone leave.
Why everyone?
No special reason.
Reminds me of my past.
It’s none of your business, of course.
You’ll break that chair.
A past love, I suppose?
What else?
It was... a secret passion.
I never told anyone.
No one ever found out.
Not even my daughters.
The daughters you’re always going on about!
I’d like to meet them.
- Hush up!
And this passion went sour, if I get your meaning.
My fiancé had a name
that was grating to the ear
An irritating name
that was more than I could bear
So I went and left him
without a word, without a sign
It’s been 10 years now
since his path diverged from mine
I had told him
one night so tenderly
That we were soon to be
no longer two but three
It’s a woman’s greatest claim
It fills a man with pride
Booboo, the poor dear,
would soon be by my side
He was a handsome fellow
and I a sweet young thing
Even though I had twins
before I met him
He never met the girls
I kept them out of sight
They went to boarding school
and never came home at night
A few years later,
through a mutual friend
I let him know
that some tycoon from Mexico
Had offered me his hand
and a beachside bungalow
It was bitter lie,
pathetic duplicity
So here I am alone,
and my youth is long gone
I came to see this town
where the only love I’d known
Had seen the day
I settled here permanently
Living amid memories,
my life’s debris
You don’t know what became of him?
No. He’s probably in Paris.
You should try and find him.
What was this monster’s name?
Dame. Simon Dame.
I’d have become
Madame Dame. Absurd!
He was a bastard!
Not at all, Papa.
Calm down.
A bastard!
Maybe so, but he had a charming name.
"Madame Dame."
It’s amusing.
- So I did wrong?
- I didn’t say that.
- Shall we?
- It’s figurative?
I told you:
It’s my only figurative work.
The abstracts are at camp.
You coming with us?
To see my feminine ideal.
- Where?
On show at Guillaume Lancien’s gallery.
Around the corner.
Sorry, I really can’t.
- You snub my work.
- No, I don’t.
So long. Coming?
- You’ve been crying.
- Not at all.
Don’t lie. I can tell.
- I like your hat.
- So do I.
Is that all that’s new?
I’m flustered:
I just met my dream man.
Otherwise, we’re working.
I haven’t seen Delphine in three days.
We’re hard at work.
Next week we’re off to Paris.
I’ll work with the philharmonic, and Delphine the Opéra.
We’re not going to rot here.
- Well, you’re big girls now.
Dutrouz’s right:
There’s trouble everywhere.
Why this urge to fight all the time?
I forgot my beret.
So long, Maxence.
Who’s that?
Maxence. A painter doing his military service.
Get down!
I told you not to walk on the tables!
Leaving already?
I’m going home.
Bye, Mom.
Come for dinner tomorrow.
Dutrouz will be there.
- Who’s Dutrouz?
- You don’t know him?
A friend of Gramps’ from back in ’24.
They met last week for the first time in 40 years.
- See you tomorrow.
- Till then.
You again?
Your sister’s charming.
- That’s my daughter.
- Her too?
I had twins by a first lover, but they’re not identical.
Then I had Booboo, much later.
Another lover.
Be polite.
I’m not in the mood.
We aren’t either.
We’ve got trouble.
- Is that so?
- The girls left us.
- The girls?
- The ones you saw this morning.
They do a number for us – not bad, in fact – to draw customers.
The Asian shimmy.
That’s right.
So now we’re up the creek.
You won’t find anyone here to do an Asian shimmy.
That... or something else.
Your daughters could help us.
Don’t count on it.
They can dance, no?
Delphine dances.
Solange sol-fa’s.
She writes music. She can dance too.
But they won’t do it.
- You don’t think so?
I’m sure of it.
With their talent, they’re not going to rot here.
Next week they’re off to Paris.
What’ll it be?
- White wine?
Two glasses.
It wouldn’t hurt to ask.
- It’s worth a try.
- Nothing ventured...
Oh, my God!
One of Booboo’s pranks.
That’s her.
Your ideal?
I once knew a young lady who looked a bit like that.
A dancer.
This was 40 years ago.
But she was a brunette, with short hair.
- Then not at all alike.
- Not really.
A slight resemblance here.
But I don’t know anyone like that.
You won’t find that sort in Rochefort.
I’ve searched for her
I’ve traveled countless miles
From Bali to Lima,
across the South Sea isles
From deep river beds
to beds where young girls smile
I keep running after her,
hoping all the while
Just knowing she’s alive
makes her my beacon fire
Knowing she’s out there
fills me with more desire
Than all the naked girls
in my wildest fantasies
I’ve looked everywhere
I’ve sailed the seven seas
Can she be far?
Is she close to me?
I couldn’t say,
but I know that she exists
Is she a wicked girl
or born to royalty?
A movie celebrity
Or a simple florist?
I know she’ll belong to me
That’s all, children.
I met my dream man!
Where?
In the street.
Tell me.
I picked up Booboo at school
He was whining and being a fool
He threw a tantrum in the street
He slammed his bag down at his feet
There I am, with bikes wheeling round
Picking up notebooks from the ground
When I hear a masculine sigh
I look up to see this beautiful guy
He pours words
in my ear like honey
Humming like a swarm
of playful bees
I look at him
His eyes take me in
My heart goes into a spin
He’s dark, with an intelligent air,
streaks of grey in his hair
Like a shepherd or troubadour
It was like a concerto overture
His languid gaze
says more than I can tell
We’re both caught
in the same spell
Booboo’s waiting
Traffic’s rolling still
But time has stopped
for our idyll
But we really have to part
My handsome stranger gives a start
He says, his emotion growing,
"Excuse me, but your slip is showing"
And that was all
Is he near or far?
Can he be in Rochefort?
I’ll find him
because I know that he exists
I know what reason says,
but my heart can tell me more
Its reign, its law
is something no one can resist
And resist I never will
Surely a foreigner or a tourist.
- Why? Did he have an accent?
- I don’t remember.
A camera?
So why an American?
I said a foreigner, not an American.
Not all foreigners are American.
But they’re often tourists.
Good Lord!
What if it’s him?
It’s Jules and Jim!
You two again!
You know them?
Yes, we’ve met.
Don’t stand there in the doorway.
I’m cold.
What do you want?
- Well, your mother, Yvonne –
- Yeah, right!
- Let them talk.
- Yes, let us talk.
Your mother, Yvonne, said you were going to Paris.
That’s right.
- And you needed someone to take you.
- We never said that.
Anyway, we can take you.
- In the truck?
- There are bunks.
I can see it now.
- We’re serious.
- What a come-on!
Well... is that all?
- We want to make a deal.
- But not in the doorway.
Take these.
Well?
- Tell them. After all, it’s your idea.
- But you’re the boss.
We’re in no hurry.
Well... to liven up our stand at the fair, we thought –
Well, it was Bill’s idea.
We thought that maybe you could do a number – something lively.
A number?
- They think we’re strippers.
- Obviously.
The fact is, the artists we hired left us high and dry at the last minute, and we need –
- Stand-ins.
- Just like that.
That’s right.
So... are you interested?
Interested isn’t the word.
But we’ll think it over.
We’re quite busy at the moment.
Does that mean yes or no?
- What do you think?
- But what do they want?
- Something lively.
- You said that already.
Something in this vein?
In Hamburg, port of call,
on a rain-slicked street
Three sailors and love meet
and go to the losers’ ball
It’s a foursome on the town
when three girls on the make
Meet losers on a round
on the street of heartbreak
In Hamburg, port of call,
three sailors from the East
Talk of romance’s thrall
as if they believed it all
As if for that price
The girls of the waterfront
would give these sailor boys
All the love they want
How was that?
- Depressing.
- And old as the hills.
We’ve had it with sailors, girls, and boats.
We get the message.
- Our song?
- They’ll like that.
We are a pair of twins
born in the sign of Gemini
With our feet on the ground
We have flights of fantasy
Give us a happy start
Give us harmony
Give it heart
and a touch of sorcery
Let it burst with joy
Let it glow with energy
Give us a song
Give us fantasy
Want us to dance too?
Modern or classic?
Something to prance to
or more romantic?
Would you like Mozart?
Would you like Stravinsky?
Johann Sebastian Bach?
Or maybe Boguslawski?
Louis Armstrong? Ellington?
Count Basie or Hampton?
Or maybe you’d prefer
Michel Legrand?
- Sing of love
- Or even hate
Just make it bright
- Sing today
- Dance tonight
Sing of light
Dance for joy
Sing of wind
Sing of sun and of rain
- Fire us
- Inspire us
Enchant and astonish us
Hang out the streamers of sun
Paint it all the color of delight
Drape every facade in light
Build bonfires of pleasures and fun
Why waste time?
Why push me away?
You’ll be my wife. . .
Why a seaside bungalow?
Why a millionaire from Mexico?
You can’t whine
till your dying day
The harmony’s sublime
What a paradigm
Where are the pretty hands
that wrote these notes?
Must I never see her again?
Why love on some Pacific shore
When it’s right here in my store?
And at the same time
A true stroke of chance
Find my great romance
The very day I leave
- Passion
- Spirit
- Love
- Folly
- Genius
- Joy
Life and happiness
SATU RDAY MORN I NG
You’re alone?
Josette took Booboo to school.
Gramps is still asleep.
Going somewhere?
- I have two days of leave left.
I’m going home to Nantes.
My leave’s immi-Nantes!
Aren’t you funny!
Give me a beer.
I’ll be back Monday morning in time to pack my bags.
Then it’s so long, Rochefort.
Someone butchered a dame
by the château in Etiquette Lane
A wicker basket found today
contained the pieces of Pélagie Rosier
Ex-Folies Bergère chorine
and one-time beauty queen
Aged 60, she won hurrahs
under her stage name Lola-Lola
She nailed audiences to their seat
before bringing them to their feet
The basket’s open, the case is too
Police won’t say if there’s a clue
No stone will be left unturned
until the slasher’s name is learned
Ever heard of Lola-Lola?
I’ve never known any dancers.
Here comes Josette.
What kept you?
There was a police cordon
near school where I left your son
A sadist’s on the loose
Some think he’s a mystical recluse
Everyone’s in an uproar
It seems he used an ax or a saw
He cut her into bits
and laid her out like a puzzle kit
It was all impeccable,
the feet below
Horrors! No!
They say they’ll get the man
We must remain as calm as we can
- I’ll have a look, then catch my train
- He’s on immi-Nantes leave!
- Until Monday
- Your gear
- Good-bye, friends
- Bon voyage
- A rotten crime, a filthy skunk!
- Yet he put away the pieces in a trunk
- Be so good as to move along
- Please don’t get us wrong
Don’t make us
club you on the ear
The blood came out to here
It was a sweet old
white-haired sister
- It boggles the mind
- Blonds are my kind
Well, thanks a lot, mister
Don’t get angry
I prefer blonds
But it’s not because
your hair’s red
That I’d take an ax
to your head
- Would the sadist be you?
- Heavens, no. And you?
- Teach music is what I like to do
- Abstract art is my conceit
But my ambition’s more concrete:
I’m looking for the ideal woman
I did a painting of her though
Come see it at my studio
- We can maybe do a séance
- Good old Maxence !
- How d’you know my name?
- Mom mentioned it when you came
Yesterday to the café
I’m Solange Garnier
- Ah, you’re the twin, right?
- You might be more polite
- Where’re you headed?
- Train to catch
I’m off to Nantes
My leave’s immi-Nantes
That didn’t make you laugh one bit
- That’s bargain-basement wit
Don’t take it out on me
So long
Another time, maybe
Excuse me, sir
I’m looking
for a certain piano store
- I never buy any
- But that’s plain silly!
Painting’s more in my chords
I play on canvas, not keyboards
Well, music is my line
But I think painting, too, is fine
I’ll tell you what I think
You and I are in the pink
I’ve really got to run
I’ve got a train at 1:00
My leave is immi-Nantes
Immi-Nantes leave!
That’s one I can’t believe!
- Sorry, miss
- Excuse me, sir
I’m so remiss
Let me help
Are you hurt?
No, but if you’re in a rush,
no need to make a fuss
I don’t mean to be a pain
But I’ve been searching in vain
for a guy named Dame
Who has a piano store
What a silly name!
- Nice man, though
- I don’t say no
- But it’s funny all the same
- That’s not why I came
A name tells you nothing
It’s like a face
I may look dumb,
but I’m no basket case
It’s not that I’m so giddy
I’ve been on a shopping spree
But I’m a nice girl at heart
Oh, yes, you’re looking for
your friend’s music store
Turn left here
Then take the second right
Thanks for the precious tip
Sorry, I have to run
I have an appointment at 1:00
- Hi, pumpkin! What’s that there?
- Nothing, just a tear
- Why all the boxes?
- Our costumes, fit for a queen
- Quick! Let me see!
- So simple, they suit us to a T
- Nifty! - Naughty!
- I’m hungry!
- We’re going, just wait a minute more
- Won’t we look a bit like whores?
Funny, the idea
never occurred to me
Hello, M r. Dame.
Y es...?
Don’t you recognize me?
I’m afraid, sir...
Andy!
I’ll be damned!
I’m unforgivable.
Why, I often think of you.
I even wrote to your Paris agent yesterday.
- Have I changed that much?
- Not at all.
But I never expected to see you in my shop after all these years.
Ten years.
- Yep, ten years.
It’s nice here. Peaceful.
You live alone?
What about Yvonne?
She never came back.
But why this honor?
I’m on a concert tour of Europe.
I was in Paris yesterday and thought of you.
My agent told me you were here, so here I am.
I’m so glad to see you.
I really admire your work.
What success!
Truly fabulous.
Even during conservatory days your talent was obvious.
You knew what you wanted, and you got it.
That’s true.
When I was a boy,
I dreamed of conquering the world
In my thoughts,
notes and scales swirled
For me, a piano chord
had infinite charm
For a fortissimo
I’d have given my right arm
For a symphony
I’d have sold my brother
For a melody
I’d have betrayed my mother
Music was my whole life,
you see
And no person
could get through to me
Today I have everything
I yearned for
Fame, talent, money, and more
I’m flattered,
worshipped, dehumanized
Stupidity has left me
demoralized
I’d have liked
to fight for true treasures
I’d sacrifice it all
for tender pleasures
I didn’t have love,
but love is here today
Every since
that girl came my way
Can she be far?
Is she near to me?
I never saw her again
but I know now she exists
Is she chaste?
Or does she live fast and free?
Her virtue means nothing
because I am an artist
And love is the sole authority
So you’re disappointed and in love?
Not disappointed, but wise and in love.
For all that, will you stay in Rochefort?
I can’t.
I play in Paris tomorrow.
But I’ll be back next week.
I must find that girl.
Maybe you know her?
There are lots of pretty girls here.
So you wrote to me?
Yes, about a young friend... an admirer who’d like to meet you.
She writes music.
I’ll say no more.
But you can help her. She deserves it.
- Are you in love?
- Maybe.
- Pretty?
- Much more.
Wow!
I’m so thrilled to see you.
Listen to this.
Tell me what you think.
I’ve heard that somewhere.
Nice, isn’t it?
Very.
I’ve heard it somewhere before.
But where?
- That’s odd! Where’s my concerto?
- You had it today, indeed a while ago.
But I put it in the usual place, between my lipstick and eyeglass case.
Here comes Subtil Dutrouz.
You’ve all met. Have a seat, do.
- I don’t believe I know these girls.
- I spoke of them.
They’re my twin pearls.
I believe we’ve met someplace.
No, I never forget a face.
Upon my word, I’ve seen you somewhere unless there’s a double of you out there.
- Delphine is a dancer.
- Doubtless, I’m wrong.
Solange is well versed in music and song. You’re just in time.
But before you partake, do us the honors and cut the cake.
I wouldn’t know how.
Are you being modest?
I shan’t decline if you insist.
Please do, Dutrouz.
- Maxence isn’t here, alas.
- He went home on a weekend pass.
He called his leave "immi-Nantes."
I had a good laugh.
- The pun’s inelegant.
- Who’s this joker?
A painter-poet.
A sailor who can do a portrait.
Does he love me?
It’s anyone’s guess.
I drink to your love and success.
To old times, so exotic!
Salonica! We met there, in aeronautics.
We met in Cherbourg, in front of a bar.
He’d been thrown out, drunk as a tar.
At the time, life was no joke.
I’d lost my job and was flat broke.
I got drunk.
- What a downer!
- Don’t be a snot!
- Don’t scratch.
- So what?
Hands on the table!
Enough champagne! He’s unbearable!
- I’m sure we’ve met somewhere before.
- We haven’t. Don’t insist anymore.
- Let the gentleman finish his story.
- Things weren’t hunky-dory.
I roamed through Cherbourg aimlessly after spending six months at sea.
I knew a hairdresser in Cherbourg, Aimé.
He married a certain Mme Desnoyers.
A widow from Tours, or was it Orleans?
She was a mother, a one-time chorine.
I don’t know her.
No, it was Nantes, it seems.
- Is there any ice cream?
- Be quiet.
The dinner’s a bit dull.
How about a spectacle?
Do a number from your show.
- Without a piano, no.
- I’m feeling a bit out of tune.
- I haven’t seen your stage costume.
- Tomorrow.
But I won’t be at the fair.
I’m open on Sundays. I’m stuck here.
Leaving, then?
Alas, all good things come to an end.
- We’re off as well. We start at dawn.
- Don’t get up. We’re going, we’re gone.
- Booboo’s sleeping the sleep of the just.
- With the bottle he drank, he must!
The sandman’s gone a bit insane.
He sprinkled Booboo with champagne.
Good night, dears.
How do I get this one up the stairs?
SUNDAY
Ride, ride, ride!
Ride on air.
No stress, no cares.
For all tastes. At all prices.
- I messed up my eyes!
- They’re fine.
Have you seen my glove?
You’re on.
I can’t go on with one glove.
Here it is!
Hurry up.
And now, it’s our pleasure to present the Garnier sisters!
Here they are, the famous Garnier sisters!
When the summer is gone,
when the seasons move on
When the leaves die and fall,
we only sigh about it all
But to bring back a summer’s day
when the cold is here to stay
And your heart’s in a pall,
all you have to do is love
Love your life, love the flowers
Love to laugh, love to cry
Love the day, love the night
Love the sunshine and showers
Love the cold, love the wind
Love the cities and the fields
Love the sea, love the flames
Love the world and be happy again
When love has gone and died
and there’s a chill in your heart
You swear never again to start,
and all you do is cry
But if love’s to return
and your heart is to burn
Though everything’s taciturn,
you’ve got to love
When you’ve found new delight,
when you feel your heart’s might
And love is back in sight,
each day is a summer’s day
So with new joys in store
and summer at your door
And love as your servitor,
you’ve got to sing
Sing of love, sing of flowers
Sing of laughter and tears
Sing of day, sing of night
Sing of rain and sunlight
- Talk about stage fright!
- It went all right.
It came undone here.
- A guy to see you.
- Me?
- No, Delphine.
- Who is it?
He didn’t say.
Well, we got applause.
Not quite the Asian shimmy, but it’s got charm.
Enough out of you.
Go find your shimmiers, you boors!
Oh, it’s you.
Disappointed?
Yes.
I saw your act.
I came to say you’ve made progress.
And apart from the flattery?
If you wanted,
I could make you a star.
Come with me.
I’m going to Paris.
A lovely girl like you –
- Needs a man like you.
I love how you think on your feet.
I never want to see you again.
You’ll regret it.
What about my painter?
Transferred to Germany.
Thanks to me, dear heart.
Delphine... my sister.
- It was wonderful.
- Thank you.
Really, I mean it.
You’re leaving tomorrow?
- Yes.
These gentlemen will take us to Paris.
I saw my friend Andy.
He came here to see me.
He’s going back to Paris.
He’s fallen in love with a girl he saw here.
It’s a long story.
I told him about you.
You can go see him in Paris.
Thank you.
That was kind of you.
It’s only natural.
Good-bye, gentlemen.
Bye, girls.
- Bye, Mr. Dame.
Good luck.
- Don’t stay there.
- We in the way?
We’d like to change.
Turn around.
- We have something to say.
- Make it quick.
Can we draw these?
We’re waiting.
Here goes:
Etienne and I love you.
And we love you too.
Don’t we?
Sure we do.
Can one of you pass me my jeans?
- We mean romantically.
- What?
- We’re in love with you.
- What are they talking about?
So we want to sleep with you.
What?
It’s normal when you’re in love.
- That explains the ride?
- We’ll take the train.
You’re not very accommodating.
We know your type.
Always the same old tune,
always the same soft sell
Always the man who will
take you to a hotel... Why?
Never "I love you"
Never "I’ll be true"
Never a billet doux
as gentlemen used to do
Always the same refrain,
always the quick fling
Always a love in vain
never leading to anything
Why? Oh why?
Never fine sentiments
Never a romantic urge
Never a moment intense
or a lyrical surge
Always guys on the run,
always the one-night stand
Always up before the sun
and off with a wave of the hand
Always the passion that cools,
always the bad aftertaste
Always the feeling of haste,
the heart playing the fool
Oh why?
Why do you sigh for us?
Why do you take us to bed?
Why say you’d die for us
but never promise to wed?
- Why get so upset?
- Why lecture us like this?
But to end the fête
can we give you a kiss?
Okay?
Okay
- Still coming tomorrow?
- If you promise to behave.
- We’ll try.
- Then we’re coming.
- Meet us here at noon.
- See you tomorrow.
- Always the same refrain
- Always the letdown
- Always telling us no
- Never is the answer yes... oh, why?
Always those promises
But tomorrow never comes
We never have a chance
We really look dumb
Why?
MONDAY MORNI NG
Postman!
Hurry. You’ll be late.
Hurry, Booboo.
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Mom.
- A cup of coffee.
- Make it two.
- Leaving already?
- We’ll be back.
- Taking my girls?
- We meet at noon.
Be careful.
Was the fair a success?
- A huge one.
- And my girls?
- A triumph!
They made the front page!
With a photo!
"Twins launch their own Gemini."
What’s that mean?
- I don’t get it.
- Me neither.
Look, it’s Dutrouz!
"Sadist Hid Murder Weapon at Home."
That’s Dutrouz, all right.
They forgot the Z.
He’ll lose his head.
If he holds on to it.
How about that!
- Shall we?
- Let’s go.
We have to go by the hotel, then finish loading.
And that fuss about cutting the cake!
Wicked man!
Good-bye, and bon voyage.
If you’re ever in Rochefort, stop by.
True, there’s trouble everywhere.
Dutrouz... the rat!
- I’ve come for my lesson.
- School’s closed for good.
- Who was it?
- The Dumont girl, for her lesson.
At this hour!
It’s 11:30.
I didn’t cancel!
We’ll never make it by noon!
We must say good-bye to Mom and go pick up Booboo.
How will I manage in time?
I’ll kiss Mom good-bye while you go by the school.
What’d you lose?
- The third movement of my concerto.
This is a disaster!
- You know it by heart.
Still, it’s annoying.
- What if they really love us?
- Who?
Our carnies.
I don’t know.
- They’re sweet.
- Yes, they are.
What about your foreigner?
Vanished.
Maybe I dreamed him up.
And your painter?
- He’s in Germany.
- Expecting someone?
- No, but now we’re really late.
Solange, you must come right away.
Where?
To my shop.
Andy’s back and waiting for you.
- Now?
- Right now. He’s just passing through.
But we’re so late already, and I must pick up my brother at school.
Maybe he could go.
The school’s right nearby.
It’d help us out.
- How can you?
Of course I will!
Ask for Booboo.
He’s a little redhead.
Impossible! I can’t go!
I’m scared stiff! I’ll see him in Paris.
- Nonsense. Go on.
- Yes, go on.
- I’m shaking.
It’s so crazy!
Not even a hello?
What a difference.
I mean, from the uniform.
I’m out, Yvonne.
Time to live.
- I thought they’d keep you in,
- given the news.
- What news?
You seen the papers?
Trouble all over.
Come on! Dutrouz may be a pessimist, but you?
Speak of the devil.
Look at this.
He’s the sadist.
A crime of passion.
For 40 years she turned him down.
Sure, it was aggravating, but that’s no reason to carve her up.
I guess he cut her down to size.
Well, I’m off.
To Paris?
You may run into my daughters.
I met one the other day...
Solange.
And your ideal?
It’ll have to wait.
My picture’s at the gallery.
Go see it sometime.
Let me kiss you good-bye.
Good-bye, Maxence.
Hi, Mom.
- So you’re really off?
- About time!
- Solange isn’t coming by?
- I came for both of us.
I guess you can’t go get Booboo.
He’s in good hands.
A friend, Mr. Dame, went for him.
Lucky he came by.
What’d you say? Mr. Dame?
Simon Dame.
A silly name, but a nice man.
I have to go out.
Gramps is asleep. Josette isn’t back.
Watch the place.
But I can’t!
They’re waiting for me.
Be right back.
Yvonne! My paper!
You hear me?
I forgot my bag.
Somebody there?
The foreigner...
Are you Andy?
- That’s me.
- Where’d you find that music?
- In the street.
I looked all over.
So did I.
I looked all over for you.
Yvonne! You’re here.
How was Mexico?
Lovely, Simon.
- Where’re you going?
- Paris.
We’ll go in my car.
At 140 mph, it’ll take four hours.
I’m in no hurry.
Forget about that painter.
I’ll go to Germany if I must, but I’ll find him.
Good luck, then.
- Tell me where he is.
- Paris.
"Paris is small for a great passion like yours."
You’re sure to run into him on the boulevards.
Hurry. We’ve been waiting.
- Solange isn’t here?
- Too bad!
But we were to meet at noon.
It’s nearly half past.
Get in.
Wait for a minute.
Here she comes.
- No, it’s Josette.
- Wait for me.
Take me along.
I want to see Paris.
Hop in.
We go from place to place
across rivers and valleys
They call us carnies
The road is our home base
